<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earth and Sea con∣stitute a round Globe.</NOTE><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Rom the round Shadow which darkens or eclipseth the Moon, the different Rising and Setting of the Cele∣stial Luminaries, and the various Elevation of the Zenith, or Vertical Point, infallibly demonstrates, That the Earth and Sea making one Body, presents exactly the Figure of a Globe: Which though the Surface of this mighty Ball be rough and gibbous, ma∣ny parts thereof swoln into Rocks and high Moun∣tains, others sunk into depressed Valleys, yet make an even and smooth Circumference: for the highest Tops and lowest Descents are nothing in comparison to the Magnitude of this vast Body, but seem less than Warts on the Hand, or small Furrows in a Plough'd Field.</P>
<P>Incircling this our Terrestrial Orb at an unmeasurable distance, sparkle the innumerable Lights, in the immense expansions of the Firmament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Description of Hea∣ven and Earth.</NOTE>About the Earth, the Air spreading it self into three Regions, dispenseth from the middle, all sorts of Meteors, with their several Effects upon us. The lowest Storie variety of Birds and flying Fowls make their Receptacle; the Sea and Rivers, Fish inhabit: but the Earth and Sea, and all Creatures there residing, the Creator left solely to the gubernation of Man, under whose Command they remain, so inverting the Authority of Power, placed the <HI>Mi∣crocosmus</HI> over the <HI>Macrocosme,</HI> the little World to Rule the great.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The distribution of the People upon the Earth.</NOTE>But since the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> his Generations persisting, more and more in∣creasing their enormous sins, and louder-crying offences, brought Gods just Judgment upon them, who therefore destroy'd the Old World by an Inunda∣tion or general Deluge, onely preserving eight Persons, who descending from the Ark, the Waters being ceased, a new World began; in which by degrees
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>their numerous Progeny so multipli'd, that they were forc'd to Plant fresh Colonies, still more and more remote from the Foot of the Mountain where they first settled. But nothing more help'd to the well and equal re-peo∣pling of the desolated Universe, than the confusion of Tongues, which hap∣pen'd in the Worlds Infancy at <HI>Babel,</HI> where all the Children of that Genera∣tion resolving to settle, not minding farther Discoveries, pitch'd upon the fertile Plains of <HI>Shinar;</HI> Here must be (say they) the Center of our growing and intended Empire; this our begun, this our stupendious Work, whose aspi∣ring Tower looks down already upon the Clouds, and hereafter threatens to scale the Skies, shall be the mighty, and all-commanding Head of our Impe∣rial City, which extended over these Plains, we will inhabit, and with our Lives and Fortunes guard and maintain. But they in their vain Design and presumptuous Project, were suddenly baffled by Divine Providence, who in stead of setling, scatter'd them over the face of the Earth: for when they were at the busiest, and in the heighth of their expectation, labouring to finish this marvellous Structure, thus the Almighty disappointed their whole endeavours, all Tasks were suddenly thrown aside, each mistaking, not understanding one another; in which confusion their onely comfort was, to meet with any that spake with them the same Language: These using one Tongue, gathering in a Body, stuck together, and in several Companies fled to strange and unpeopl'd Regions; where Planting they flourish'd, and suddenly grew up to be several great Kingdoms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Since call'd <HI>Europe, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> the then onely known Countrey.</NOTE> So this their total rout, and flying to all the Angles of the Universe, proved for the better, each by this means being sooner suppli'd; so extending by degrees their fresh Colonies to the utmost and Maritime Coast.</P>
<P>Yet however, one Party after this dissolution remaining still upon the Spot, which though they utterly sleighted their begun Tower, leaving it to ruine and decay, yet went on chearfully with their chief City; where <HI>Nimrod</HI> first taking the Title and supreme Authority upon him, sat in his new erected Throne, first Monarch of the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Empire. Besides him, many absolute Princes were thus in process of time establish'd in their several Dominions, and the whole World seem'd to be once more totally replenish'd.</P>
<P>When the restless Nature of Man, either unsatisfi'd with what he hath at∣chiev'd, or spurr'd on by ambition, or urgent necessity, to enlarge their Bounds for their supernumerary Swarms, gave the beginning to the Iron, or turbu∣lent Age, War and Hostility raging every where, in which those prevailing, grew high and mighty, those conquer'd, low and humble, continual vicissi∣tudes and fluctuations of People, Kingdoms subverted in Republicks, and Common-wealths, weary of such Government, turn'd again into Monarchies. The weakest Party, put to all extremities, and worst of exigencies by the pur∣suing Enemy, were enforc'd, all Land deni'd them, venturing for refuge into the wide Ocean, were soon swallow'd up; some driven they knew not whi∣ther, lighted on uninhabited Countreys, there beginning new Plantations, and perhaps, by such Fugitives the new World never heard of by antiquity, became of old to be peopled, and by that means grown since to such vast Empires, as our late Voyagers have discover'd.</P>
<P>Here it will not seem amiss to give you an account, according as all Writers have it, how this our Old World was peopled, <HI>viz. Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and who were the Fathers, or chief Captains, giving Denominations to the People, and setling them in their several Plantations, beginning with Holy Scripture.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Offspring of <HI>Japhet.</HI></NOTE><HI>Noah</HI> and his three Sons, <HI>Japhet</HI> being the eldest, his Offspring spread them∣selves over <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe. Moses</HI> recounts these to be the Sons of <HI>Japhet, Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech,</HI> and <HI>Tiras: Gomer,</HI> as they say, first settled his Colony along the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> where <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> place the <HI>Cemerians;</HI> the Sons of <HI>Gomer</HI> being <HI>Ashkenaz, Riphat,</HI> and <HI>Tagorma,</HI> Planted other Colonies, <HI>Ash∣kenaz</HI> laying the Foundation of the Kingdom of <HI>Media,</HI> which others contra∣dict, supposing that he settled in the lesser <HI>Asia;</HI> others, the Countrey of <HI>Hessen,</HI> or <HI>Saxony,</HI> but out of what Records we know not; and <HI>Eusebius,</HI> where ere he hath it, calls <HI>Ashkenaz</HI> the Father, or first Prince of the <HI>Gothes,</HI> whil'st the Mo∣dern <HI>Jews</HI> make him the Planter of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Nations, or <HI>High-Dutch,</HI> and the transplanted Seed of <HI>Riphat</HI> into more Northern Regions, gave Denomina∣tion to the <HI>Riphean</HI> Mountains beyond <HI>Scythia,</HI> which afterwards took in <HI>Pa∣phlagonia.</HI> From his third Son <HI>Togarma,</HI> sprang the <HI>Togarmians,</HI> who sat down on the North-side of <HI>Canaan,</HI> beyond <HI>Cappadocia:</HI> but it appears by the <HI>Chalde Paraphrase,</HI> that <HI>Togarma</HI> peopled <HI>Germany;</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> affirm, that the <HI>Turco∣many,</HI> or <HI>Turks,</HI> are also sprung from the <HI>Togarmians,</HI> whereupon still the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperor is by them call'd <HI>Togar.</HI> But <HI>Magog, Japhets</HI> second Son inhabited <HI>Coelesyria, Mada,</HI> and the Territory of <HI>Media. Javan,</HI> the third, was Father to the <HI>Ionians,</HI> who in process of time, growing great with other conjoyn'd Nations, call'd themselves <HI>Greeks,</HI> their Countrey <HI>Grecia.</HI> From these the <HI>Latines</HI> drew their original: whereupon at first, a great part of <HI>Italy</HI> was call'd <HI>Greece;</HI> and still several Names of <HI>Italian</HI> Cities do undeniably shew the Extract of the <HI>La∣tines</HI> from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> which the antient Writers affirm, by making <HI>Javan</HI> to be the Bifronted <HI>Janus,</HI> signifying Father both to the old <HI>Greeks,</HI> and new <HI>Latines,</HI> descended from him. The Sons of <HI>Javan</HI> were four, <HI>Elisha,</HI> who Planted in the Islands of the <HI>Mediterranean Sea; Tarshish,</HI> from whom <HI>Tarsus</HI> in <HI>Cilicia</HI> bears the Name; and <HI>Kittim,</HI> a Place in <HI>Cyprus,</HI> where between the two utmost Points <HI>Thro∣nus</HI> and <HI>Dades,</HI> in the Entrance formerly stood the City <HI>Kittim;</HI> and still the Point <HI>Dades</HI> bears the Name of <HI>Cape Chiti. Dedanim, Javans</HI> youngest Son, possess'd that part of <HI>Eperia,</HI> where the City <HI>Dodona</HI> was renown'd famous for the Oracle of <HI>Jupiter Dodoneus,</HI> presaging by tinckling Brass Instruments, or Cymbals, and also from the oraculous Oak it self, which (as they say) spake from its hollow womb, giving Responses. From <HI>Japhets</HI> fifth Son sprang the <HI>Tubaleans,</HI> afterwards call'd <HI>Syrians.</HI> Others, according to <HI>Josephus,</HI> set themselves down in <HI>Spain,</HI> (so believ'd) because the antient City <HI>Setubal</HI> in that Kingdom retains <HI>Tubals</HI> Name. <HI>Meshechs</HI> Progeny steer'd their Coast towards <HI>Arabia.</HI> The Antients differ in no thing more, than settling the Habitations of <HI>Tiras, Japhets</HI> youngest Son: <HI>Jose∣phus</HI> affirms him to be Father of the <HI>Thracians,</HI> in whose Countrey <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> delineate the River <HI>Atira:</HI> Others transplant him to the <HI>European Sarmatia,</HI> ac∣cording to <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> sprinkled with the Stream call'd <HI>Tyras,</HI> and at present <HI>Nester:</HI> Some make <HI>Tiras</HI> the Builder of <HI>Tyre</HI> in <HI>Phoenycia;</HI> again, some of the <HI>Duringi∣ans</HI> and others, of <HI>Thurium,</HI> a very antient City in the entrance of <HI>Tarentine.</HI></P>

Ashur</HI> Founded within the built City <HI>Nineveh,</HI> the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Power: formerly the <HI>Heathen</HI> Histo∣ries bring these down from <HI>Ninus.</HI> Concerning <HI>Arphaxad, Moses</HI> saith thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Genes.</HI> 10.</NOTE> <HI>And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. And unto Eber were born two sons: the name
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>of one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brothers name was Joktan. And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobah: all these were the sons of Joktan. And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Shephar, a mount of the east. These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. Benedictus Arias Montanus</HI> ascribes particularly these Distributions to every one of the Children of <HI>Joktan,</HI> that is to say, to <HI>Almodad,</HI> the People of <HI>Themeotes,</HI> according to <HI>Ptolomy</HI> and <HI>Mela,</HI> transplanted into the <HI>Asiatick Sarmatia;</HI> to <HI>Sheleph,</HI> the <HI>Selebians;</HI> to <HI>Ha∣zarmaveth,</HI> the <HI>Sarmatians;</HI> to <HI>Jarka,</HI> the <HI>Arachosians;</HI> to <HI>Hadora,</HI> the <HI>Hircanians;</HI> to <HI>Uzal,</HI> the <HI>Oxiaenian Bactrians;</HI> to <HI>Dikla,</HI> the <HI>Scythians,</HI> within the Mountains of <HI>Imaus;</HI> to <HI>Obal,</HI> the <HI>Obolites,</HI> between the top of <HI>Caucasus</HI> and <HI>Paropanisus;</HI> to <HI>Abi∣mael,</HI> the <HI>Imaenses,</HI> where the renown'd <HI>Imaus</HI> hath very high Precipices; to <HI>Sheba,</HI> the famous <HI>Saces:</HI> yet others think it more advisable to bring the <HI>Sabeans</HI> to <HI>Sheba,</HI> bordering on the <HI>Persians; Ophir,</HI> call'd <HI>The Territory of Ophir,</HI> whether <HI>Solomon</HI> every third year set forth a Fleet to fetch Gold from thence. Yet after all the Distributions and Sprinklings of Mankind over the surface of the Earth, much of it confirm'd by many Authors, and also by sacred Writ, our Mo∣dern Geographers, and late Travellers, hardly make out scarce two Parts of three of the Terrestrial Globe to be yet inhabited, all the Antartick, and most of the Artick Regions, an unfrequented Desolation, and <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> full of unpenetrated Desarts, and inaccessible Mountains, and many Isles: Of which several were discover'd by the Antients, and since by our Moderns, not thought worthy the labour of Cultivation, amongst which our <HI>Japan</HI> lay a long time Fallow, till by a necessitous Calamity a few miserable Exiles, be∣ing (as they say) banish'd from their Countrey, were enforc'd to Plant there; which from such poor beginnings, and unwilling undertakers, hath insensi∣bly by degrees in few Ages, shot up from nothing, to be a most Potent and formidable Empire.</P>
<P>But before we proceed any farther in this our intended Design, concerning a Description and Relation of <HI>Japan,</HI> (of which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are most able to give the best account) it seems not amiss, raising our selves a little from our Seat, to look round about, and by an easie Prospect take a brief and general Survey, not onely of the new Art of Navigation, but also of those famous Na∣vigators, that boldly first adventur'd to unloose (though thought unpossible before) the Virgin Zone of this our Terraqueous Globe; so not onely finding undiscover'd Parts of the East, but also a new Western <HI>Indies,</HI> abounding in Gold and Silver, as the other in Silk and Spices; besides, giving us a farther account of a third Continent (though yet unknown) equivalent to either of the former.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Compass by whom found.</NOTE>The Loadstone, or Magnet, whose several Vertues, and wonderful Opera∣tions, being well known through many Ages; yet that it was a <HI>Terrella,</HI> or little Earth, having Poles respecting the North or Southern Points of the Firma∣ment, having imaginary Meridians and Parallels, being the greatest wonder, and of most use, was not found untill <HI>Flavius Melvius</HI> a <HI>Neopolitan</HI> discover'd it, about two hundred years since, to the great benefit of Mankind, and perfecti∣on in Navigation; before which without Compass or Chart, the poor Sea∣man, when stressed with Weather, the Sun and Stars, his onely Pilot, Night and Day muffl'd in Clouds, he crept along the Shore, which was the constant practice, or emboldned by the signs of fair Weather, ventur'd farther into
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>the Offin; their condition was most miserable, not knowing where they were, which way to Steer, or from what part of Heaven the Wind then blew: As in <HI>Virgil Aene.</HI> lib. 3.</P>
<Q><L>After our Ships so far had left the Coast</L>
<L>Till all the World, but Sky and Sea was lost,</L>
<L>A sable Cloud with Night and Tempest rose,</L>
<L>And th' Ocean rough with horrid darkness grows;</L>
<L>Inraged Winds make raging Waves more fierce,</L>
<L>And through vast Floods us every way disperse;</L>
<L>Whil'st Fleeting Tempests muffle up the Day,</L>
<L>All Heaven becomes to Gloomy Night a prey,</L>
<L>Perpetual lightning breaks from broken Clouds.</L>
<L>Drove from our course, we wander through Dark Floods,</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Palinurus</HI> knows, in such a Sky,</L>
<L>Day from the Night, or whither he should Ply.</L>
<L>Three Sun-less Days, as many nights we were</L>
<L>Wandring through dismal Fogs, without a Star;</L>
<L>But the fourth Dawn, we rising Land behold,</L>
<L>And far off Hills, which misty Clouds infold,</L>
<L>Sails struck, we row, our lusty Seamen sweep</L>
<L>The azure Pavement of the briny Deep.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Postquam altum tenuere rates, nec jam amplius ullae</L>

<L>Tum mihi caeruleus supra caput adstitit imber,</L>

<P>And lately, by the help of this great additional, the Compass, they were able to say, By your leave, taking a long farewell of <HI>Atlas,</HI> and the <HI>Herculian Pillars,</HI> fix∣ed, and looked upon as eternal boundaries of the West and South, both to Em∣pire and Navigation, and boldly ventur'd to Plow the unmeasurable bosom of vast and unknown Seas; so with a steady Course night and day, dark or light, fair or foul, with an unwearied patience, slighting all dangers, raising new Stars, and setting the old, till they happily finish'd their long Voyages; some of them compassing the World, Girdling the Universe, making the utmost East and West joyn hands together.</P>
<P>Thus they have, in a manner, accurately Surveigh'd the New World, <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> inspecting it from Coast to Coast, from the East to the Western Ocean; and <HI>Magellanica,</HI> the last or unknown World, though they have not so penetra∣ted as the former, yet by Sailing the skirts of its extended Border, they Cal∣culated, by the largeness thereof, to be no less than another third part; so baf∣fling the opinion of the Antients with a <HI>finis,</HI> that were so stupid to sit down contented with the onely knowledge of a third part of the whole world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How <HI>Columbus</HI> came to the knowledge of a new World.</NOTE>The first <HI>Neptunian Hero,</HI> or great Sea-Captain, who had the prime honour of discovering the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> was <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> a <HI>Genoese;</HI> who having Marry'd in <HI>Portugal,</HI> settled in the <HI>Maderas:</HI> He being ingenious, and naturally much addicted to Novelty, still hearkening after new Projects, as well to sa∣tisfie his own Inclination, as to improve his Fortune, by chance in his Travels fell acquainted with <HI>Marcus Paulus,</HI> a <HI>Florentine,</HI> not onely a Physician, but a great Naturalist and Student in Philosophy; who finding his humor, highly
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>treated his curious and inquisitive disposition, with then suppos'd imaginary Stories, first discovering to him <HI>Antipodes,</HI> and making out by rational demon∣strations, that the great Celestial Luminaries, where not idle nor hudwink'd up in their absence from us, and our privation of light; nor as the antient Po∣ets tell us, that <HI>Phoebus</HI> when setting, descended into <HI>Thetis</HI> Lap; so all night, quenching his Horses fiery Fetlocks, swimming under water, till drawing near the East, he with reflected Beams colour'd the Golden Port-holes of the Dawn. But that these great and Resplendant Lights sprinkl'd, and chear'd with fe∣cundating Rays, in alternate Day, so blessing other places, that were no less than inhabitable Worlds with happy fertility, making evident, that the Earth was not round and flat like a Trencher, as other old Writers affirm'd, but Or∣bicular and hung Self-poysed, surrounded not onely with Air, but the vast expansions of the Sky.</P>
<P>But whilest he ruminated and revolved such Notions in his Working Fancy, so it hapned, that a Vessel Bound for <HI>Africa,</HI> was driven quite from her inten∣ded Course by extremity of Weather, and many days tossed up and down in the wide Ocean, far out of sight from any Land; and at last having spent all their Provision, in a most miserable condition put in to the Haven of <HI>Madera,</HI> where the Captain and his whole Crue being utterly Famish'd with long Fast∣ing, and past all recovery by Refreshment, soon after dy'd. But the Master, whom <HI>Columbus</HI> had taken to his House, in the time of his Sickness, related unto him wonderful Stories, how he had been driven on strange and altoge∣ther unknown Coasts, being by his Calculation Westward, and so far off, that he suppos'd never any <HI>European</HI> had seen; and withal, bequeath'd to him after his Death his Journal Papers, of that his so much unfortunate Voyage: who soon after Dying, <HI>Columbus</HI> with great earnestness perusing the Writings, found what confirm'd him, as if he had been there in Person, and also gave him great Instructions of directing his Course to New Countreys not yet discovered.</P>
<P>After this, he rested not long, till he put in Action what might promote his Business, that by the help of a better Purse than his own, he might Purchase Wealth and Honor by this his new and great Design.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proffers his Service to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the King of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE>First he address'd himself to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> whose Maritime Countrey being opposite to his intended Discoveries, made him (as he supposed) fittest for the Undertaking; who altogether declining it, he sent his Brother <HI>Bartholomew Columbus</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> there to make his Address, and Negotiate with King <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the Seventh, concerning these Discoveries; who famous for his great Abi∣lities and Prudence, he suppos'd the onely Prince in Christendom to imploy him in so great an Enterprise; but such was his Misfortune, that he was taken by Pirats, and kept by them (wanting Ransom) a long time close Prisoner; so that he came too late to the Court of <HI>England:</HI> For during his Captivity, his Brother <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> made Application to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Izabel,</HI> Kings of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Aragon,</HI> who then in very low condition, turmoyl'd in a great War, against the <HI>Granada Moors,</HI> did not hearken to his Proposals.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Columbus</HI> and his Cause lay seven years quite neglected; but when these Princes, had by their several happy Victories subdu'd their Enemies, he then in the beginning of the Peace, and first halcyon after so long a Storm, re∣new'd his Business, and mov'd the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> once more: The King and Queen then, though low, and their Treasure exhausted with the late Wars, yet began to listen to him, and at last were so much perswaded, that they took up
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>seventeen thousand Duckets upon Interest, with which they Rigg'd and Fur∣nish'd him out three handsom Vessels.</P>
<P>With which <HI>Columbus</HI> well satisfi'd, set Sail <HI>Septemb.</HI> 1. <HI>Anno</HI> 1492.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Columbus</HI> set Sail 1492.</NOTE> first direct∣ing his Course to the <HI>Canary-Isles;</HI> from thence stood full West with a Trading Wind into the great Ocean, where he soon after, met with no ordinary Storms or Huricanes, Winds blowing from all the Points of the Compass, which sad∣ly ruffled and shatter'd his Vessels: next falling (which Block prov'd to him worse than <HI>Aesop's</HI> Stork) into continual Calms; for there his Men growing sick and weary with lying so long at Sea, Mutiny'd, and despairing ever to see Land, nothing would satisfie them but a speedy return to save their Lives whilst their Provisions lasted: He thus put to it, was inforc'd to promise them, that if they discry'd not Land in three days, he would perform their desire.</P>
<P>So it happen'd, that at the appointed time they saw Westward near the Hori∣zon, sprinkling Clouds, by which sign he overjoy'd, bidding them be of good comfort, and told them they should soon see Land, which accordingly they did; and soon after came to Anchor on the Coast of <HI>Florida,</HI> where Landing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovers <HI>Florida.</HI></NOTE> taking some short refreshment, help'd by the Natives, he took a survey of the neighboring Countrey, and the adjacent Isles; and whilst he barter'd Trifles for Gold, and other rich Commodities, he took possession of the Countrey, by raising of a Fort in his Royal Masters name; in which, leaving forty eight <HI>Spaniards,</HI> Commanded by <HI>Diego Arana,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns home.</NOTE> he departed thence Fraighted with great Riches, and ten of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after arriving in <HI>Spain,</HI> he was receiv'd with great joy, giving a good account to their Majesties of their success, with which they were so well plea∣sed, that they furnish'd him out again; then he discover'd the great Isles <HI>Hi∣spaniola,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Discovers</HI> Hispaniola <HI>and</HI> Cuba, <HI>and also</HI> Nombea De Dios, <HI>and</HI> Panama.</NOTE> and <HI>Cuba,</HI> and the bottom of the great Bay of <HI>Mexico.</HI></P>

<PB N="8" REF="10"/>and excessive heat; but finding those Coasts by Navigation, they might make a deeper inspection of the whole <HI>African</HI> Continent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His first Voyage was be∣yond Mount <HI>Atlas.</HI></NOTE>Resolv'd upon this, he put in action what with mature judgement he had design'd; and getting all things ready, furnishing some Ships for that pur∣pose, set Sail in the Year 1410, and Steering on, was the first that sunk Mount <HI>Atlas</HI> lofty Crown under the Horizon, being till that time the Terminary, or <HI>Ne plus ultra,</HI> of all Southern Navigation, discovering beyond the Mount three∣score Leagues off the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> and so return'd, but with mean success.</P>
<P>But not altogether daunted, ten years after having replenish'd his stock, de∣sign'd for such Adventures, he fitted out another Fleet, under the Command of <HI>Johannes Gonsalvez,</HI> a good and expert Sea-man, who first ventur'd to loose sight of Land, and Sail into the Main Ocean, where he, though encountering many Storms, prodigious Tempests, cross Tides, and unbridled Currents, yet bore up couragiously, and fighting his way through all Weathers, and other Incumbrances, reaching four hundred and twenty Leagues beyond <HI>Atlas;</HI> where weary and over-power'd, at last by such grand Opposers, <HI>viz.</HI> Winds and Tides, contented himself with the honour of so great a Discovery, return'd.</P>

I tell this Story, though not so pertinent, because of the wonder, that one Man should be so hardy, to venture his single Person, to travel through Countreys so full of Heat, Drought, and Desarts, and Peopled with such as he could nei∣ther
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>understand, nor they him; but thus he went, not onely through all <HI>Africa,</HI> but a great part of <HI>Asia,</HI> reaching to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> there paying his Devoti∣on, he return'd to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> giving the King an account of his miraculous adven∣tures. Upon this the King bethought himself of a less chargeable way than Rig∣ging a Fleet, which could onely discover the Coast; to which end he employ'd <HI>Pedro de Cavillano,</HI> and <HI>Alphonso Payva,</HI> both skilful in the <HI>Arabick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonderful Journey of two <HI>Portuguese.</HI></NOTE> as private Pil∣grims, to make Inspections of those Countreys, which were yet to them un∣known. They first came to <HI>Naples,</HI> then touched at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> after visited <HI>Egypt,</HI> and saw <HI>Grand Cair,</HI> from thence to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> here paying due Tears to the ho∣ly Sepulchre, they parted, travelling several Ways, <HI>Payva</HI> for <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> where he died; and <HI>Cavillano</HI> to <HI>Ormus,</HI> so to <HI>Calicut</HI> in <HI>India.</HI> Here he receiv'd Messages from the King his Master, not to return till he was able to give him a good ac∣count of <HI>Africa:</HI> Thus commanded he ventur'd into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> where the King of that Countrey became his great admirer, much taken with his Person and Parts, inviting him to dwell in his own Court, and offering him, if he would Marry, a Lady of great Fortune, and Noble Extract.</P>
<P>From the Emperors Palace he made means to send a Letter to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in which he inform'd him at large both of the <HI>Asiatick</HI> and <HI>African</HI> Countreys; and amongst the rest, described the City of <HI>Calicut,</HI> and gave a Character of the Inhabitants, who, he said, were of a swarthy, and of an Ole∣vaster Complexion, scarce knowing ought of humanity or civil address, unaf∣fable, irreligious, and ignorant of all Moral Vertue: they are proud of going naked from the Middle upwards, onely above their Elbows they wear Arm∣lets of Pearl, and a Simiter in a Belt hangs thwart their Shoulders; and about their Middle they wear Skirts, or long Bases of Purple-Silk, richly embroi∣der'd with Gold.</P>
<P>Here the Female Sex are allow'd Polygamy, one Woman may Marry as many Husbands as she pleases, and those which enjoy the greatest number, are esteem'd there the most Noble, so there is no priority to their Children by Birth, none knowing well their own Father, but either they are all Co-heirs, or else her Sisters Children Inherit.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portu∣gal</HI> is earnest to make far∣ther Discoveries of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>India.</HI></NOTE>Soon after this Information, King <HI>John</HI> died in the Year 1495. <HI>Emanuel</HI> suc∣ceeding him, and willing to go on with the Work of Discoveries, advised with his Peerage, what was best to be done in so high a Concern: His Council con∣sisting more of private than publick Spirits, who aim at Grandeurs, and the general good, first looking upon the difficulty, danger, and great Charge, then considering as to the Honor and Profit, they had gotten enough by the Disco∣veries in <HI>Africa</HI> already, and it were meer madness to take upon them more than they were able to perform: for sending fresh Ships and new Colonies to Plant remoter Countreys, would weaken the Kingdom, and disable their Navy, neither would these new-found Lands turn to any other account, more than to maintain those that settled there: these and the like they alledged. The publick-spirited Party, which were, and are commonly the fewest in all great Consultations, convinced them in all their Arguments, saying, That they had no cause to complain of the Honor and Profit which the Nation had already gotten in their first Discoveries, but that it should rather encourage them to proceed. The King's Treasure being better suppli'd, and the whole
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>Nation much employ'd, and more enrich'd by this their foreign Trade, and should they neglect what they had so happily begun and undertaken, they would not onely lose their Expence and Pains, but the whole Affair would in time by degrees moulder away to nothing. And if we should wave such hono∣rable Enterprises as these, who would attempt (discourag'd by our example) any Business that had the least face of difficulty or danger?</P>
<P>Thus the business being highly debated, the King hearkned onely to those of his Council who advis'd according to his judgment and inclination, and with all diligence speedily set forth four Ships, well appointed with Soldiers, Sea-men, and all other Necessaries, making <HI>Vasco de Gama</HI> their Admiral, adding his Brother <HI>Paulo,</HI> and <HI>Nicolao Celio</HI> for his assistance; who set Sail on the tenth of <HI>June, Anno</HI> 1497, follow'd with great sorrow, cries and tears of the Adven∣turers Wives, Children, and their nearest Relations, being possess'd with a prejudice, that the Voyage was so long and dangerous, that they should never see them again.</P>
<P>Having weigh'd Anchor, first they directed their Course to the <HI>Fortunate Isles,</HI> from thence to the <HI>Hesperides,</HI> and having clear'd <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> they steer'd more Easterly till he lost all sight of Land, and lay engag'd in the wide and open Sea three Moneths together, when in ten Degrees of Southern Latitude Land appear'd, towards which he made with all possible speed, and soon an∣chor'd in the Mouth of a pleasant River, where Landing he found some of the Natives, whose Hair was short and curl'd, and they of a swarthy Com∣plexion, were naked, who never knowing what belong'd to Commerce, nor having seen any Strangers before, they made but small Traffick with them, onely trucking Spikes, and several sorts of Nails for Cattel and Fruit. <HI>Gama</HI> call'd this Place <HI>St. Hellens Bay,</HI> and the River falling in it, <HI>St. James River.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus refresh'd, such was then their Courage, that weighing, they re∣solv'd never to touch again, till they were clear beyond <HI>Cabo Bona Esperanca;</HI> but here they were so vexed and pusl'd with almost never quiet Weather, that they not onely despair'd of performing their Expedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are in great danger.</NOTE> but also of their Preservation; the common voice and complaint of the Sea-men was, That they run themselves like blind and mad Men to their utter ruine: This despairing fancy of theirs was more and more fermented by the continuation of still vex∣ing Storms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sea-men would re∣turn.</NOTE> especially having lost all hopes of return to see their Native Countrey, Wives and Children any more. But <HI>Gama</HI> on the other side labor'd to appease and encourage them, saying, That truly noble Souls slight all dangers, and that whatsoever they had once undertaken they would never let go, nor be baffl'd or deluded with any fear, in what face soever it appear'd: but now the worst was past, the hardship in a manner over, and after a long Race they were now ready to seize the Quarry, so purchasing not onely immortal Fame for the wondrous Atchievement, but also Riches, which would both supply their present necessity, and make them and theirs for ever. But they were deaf to all perswasions; and stubbornness, mix'd with a general conster∣nation, had so block'd up their Ears, that they in stead of inclining to the ad∣vice and encouragements of their Admiral, seeing he would not hear of any return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspire his Death.</NOTE> they conspir'd his death, concluding that it were better for one Man to suffer than so many: This Combination of theirs his Brother <HI>Paulo</HI> disco∣ver'd, and several of the Crew and Masters were brought in question, and se∣cur'd, whilst <HI>Vasco</HI> taking the charge of the Helm himself, and trusting none, Steer'd, though still charged and affronted with stirring Weather, till at last he

<P>From hence, having refresh'd themselves, they Sail'd on, but making little way, being ruffl'd often with foul Weather, hollow Seas, and a contrary Cur∣rent, still running Westward: yet at last they reach'd the Confines of <HI>Zangue∣bar;</HI> which he so call'd from the Name of that Saint, and soon after cast An∣chor before <HI>Sofala,</HI> the chief City of that Countrey;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They come to <HI>Sofala.</HI></NOTE> where he found the Inha∣bitants more civiliz'd: who thought themselves very gay in Copper Hoops, or Rings, which they wore as Bracelets and Armlets, and proud of Daggers with Cotton Hilts, using a Language altogether unknown: but one of the Towns-men spake <HI>Arabick,</HI> by whom they understood, that a white People in Vessels like theirs, had traffick'd with them formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Vasco de Gama</HI> had ten Convicts, or condemn'd Persons in his Fleet, sent by the King, who sav'd their lives, to be put ashore where the Admiral thought fit, there to wander and seek their Fortunes, and if they liv'd, to make Obser∣vations of the Countrey, and learn the Language, which hereafter might, come to some account: two of these he turn'd ashore, leaving them there for that purpose: Mean while, staying a Moneth at <HI>Sofala,</HI> a great Sickness hap∣pen'd in the Fleet, from the alteration of Diet, which before was scarce and salt, now fresh and plentiful, of which many died.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To <HI>Mosambique.</HI></NOTE>The next start he made was to <HI>Mosambique,</HI> a rich City, famous for Trade and Commerce, situated in a small Isle under fifteen Degrees of Southern La∣titude.</P>
<P>Here the Merchants and Citizens went all in Sattin, embroider'd with Gold, and wear great <HI>Turbants</HI> of fine Linnen, Simiters hanging across their Shoulders, and in their left Hand a Buckler, who being thus Habited, came in
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>small Boats aboard the Admiral, who civilly and kindly treated them; where Discoursing, they told him, That their King was call'd <HI>Abraham,</HI> and was the sole Monarch of <HI>Mosambique,</HI> but under him his <HI>Xeque,</HI> or Lieutenant, Govern'd the City, That he was call'd <HI>Zocacia. Gama</HI> soon after, conversing and being amongst them, got so much in theirs and the Deputies favor, that he obtain'd two Pilots, who undertook to carry his Fleet safe to the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> which kind∣ness of theirs arose from a mistake, supposing them to be Western <HI>Saracens:</HI> but afterwards understanding that they were <HI>Christians,</HI> all this sweetning and good will turn'd to rancor and hatred, the Pilots first repenting, abhorring to do any thing for Unbelievers, leapt over-board, and so swimming to Shore, deserted the whole business. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> being troubled at this high affront, conceiving their relinquishing of them was influenc'd from the Town it self, brought all their Guns to bear upon them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fires at the City.</NOTE> which discharging, they hurt and slew several of the Inhabitants, insomuch that <HI>Zacocia</HI> was forc'd to call a Council; who there resolv'd to send him another Pilot, which had also pri∣vate instruction, in stead of carrying them to their designed Port, to betray and deliver them up to the King of <HI>Quiloa,</HI> making them believe that they were <HI>Abyssine Christians,</HI> who would kindly receive, and furnish them with all sorts of Provisions. This treachery they willingly undertook, out of malice and detestation they bore to <HI>Christianity.</HI> Thence weighing Anchor, <HI>Gama</HI> hasted with a fair Gale to the Port of <HI>Quiloa,</HI> suspecting nothing, to his utter ruine, which was there decreed, as before mention'd, when Providence, being now ready to enter the Mouth of the Harbor, sent a terrible Storm, but indeed a friendly one, which in spite of all his endeavors, Tacking to get in, drove him at last back into the Offin, and so much to the Leeward, that by his trea∣cherous Pilots advice, and they willing to save their lives, steer'd his Coast to <HI>Mombaza,</HI> a City, or rather a Fortress, being built on a Rock impregna∣ble, almost Moated round about by the Sea. Here <HI>Gama</HI> having no sooner dropt his Anchors, but the Inhabitants, delighting in Novelty, came flocking in great Companies aboard, who entertain'd them with all civility, whilst the Pilots, not forgetting their treacherous Design, inveigl'd the Inhabitants, having the advantage of the Tongue, first telling them that they were <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI> and that they would do God and their Countrey good Service, besides their own private benefit, being able to over-power them, to seize their Ships, and sacrifice those unbelieving Dogs. Thus concluding, they inform'd one another, going from Ship to Ship, as if upon curiosity and pleasure, resolving to put in action what they had thus concluded, when the Decks were more fill'd with the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>This matter was the easier to perform, because one of his Ships he had burnt already, being not able to Man her, losing so many in their last great Sickness. But <HI>Gama</HI> not liking his Anchorage, being too much within, and too near some Rocks, if he by stress of Weather should chance to drive, sud∣denly, upon better consideration, gave order to weigh, and to Anchor, as he suppos'd, in a fitter place to Ride in, and to moore his Vessels.</P>

<P>The <HI>Melindian</HI> King having withdrawn himself, being old, from all pub∣lick Address and Business, sent a handsom Present, as a token of Amity and true Friendship, by the young Prince his Son; and soon after provided him an excellent Pilot, who conducted his Fleet in twenty days safely to <HI>Calicut</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of <HI>Calicut.</HI></NOTE>The City <HI>Calicut</HI> lies on the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and though it boasts no Haven, or any safe Harbor, and yearly much troubl'd, especially in the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> with foul Weather, and overgrown Seas, raging with sudden and often violent Heuricanes, yet by its great Commerce and Trade, is a famous, rich, and well peopled Seat. It happen'd that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> arriv'd there in the midst of this their turbulent Winter, getting within two Leagues of the City; and soon after, there being a short intermission of Rain and Tempest, the In∣habitants being able, came aboard in nimble Skiffs for that purpose, and <HI>Gama,</HI> hoisting out his Pinnace, went ashore with some chosen Men, carrying ano∣ther of the foremention'd condemn'd Persons along with him; who being turn'd loose to seek his Fortune, and distinctly habited from the rest, the People flock'd about him, amongst which happen'd to be two Merchants of <HI>Tunis,</HI> one of them, whom they call'd <HI>Monzaido,</HI> being well experienced in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongue, and hospitable, took him to his own House, and afterward proffer'd all service and kindness to the Admiral <HI>Gama,</HI> himself discovering the Condition of the Countrey, and Inclinations of the Inhabitants. Whereupon <HI>Gama</HI> sent this Merchant, with two others joyn'd in Commission, as Envoys to their Emperor, or <HI>Zamarin,</HI> who besought from <HI>Gama,</HI> that he would per∣mit them safe Landing, that so he might present him Letters from his Master, the Great King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> which contain'd Matters of great consequence for the general good, especially desiring an everlasting League of Amity and Peace.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How <HI>Gama</HI> was enter∣tain'd.</NOTE>The <HI>Zamarin,</HI> or Emperor, at that time resided in <HI>Pandarana,</HI> a small City two Leagues from <HI>Calicut;</HI> where <HI>Gama</HI>'s Ambassadors had Audience, and their Request without any scruple or dilatory demurs presently granted them, ta∣king it a great kindness and honour, that he had made his Address on such an amicable purpose. The Emperor also out of meer kindness advis'd them to come to Anchors under <HI>Pandarana,</HI> there being a safer Harbor to protect them against the sudden violence of the Weather, and that also there he might the better, being so near in Person, establish the Overtures of the King his Master. And presently after he lent his prime Pleasure-Boat, call'd <HI>Catuales,</HI> from <HI>Pan∣darana,</HI> to fetch <HI>Gama</HI> in fitting State to his Royal Palace. But <HI>Gama,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gama</HI> goes to the Em∣peror, but not without be∣ing very circum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p ct.</NOTE> who by late woful experience was grown cautelous, considering the worst of what might happen, chose twelve of his stoutest Sea-men to attend him as a Guard, and some of his own Boats to wait ashore for his return, and left the charge of his Ship to his Brother, with Instructions, that if any mischance should be∣fall

<P>At that time these <HI>Indians</HI> had neither Horses, nor other Cattel to carry Men or Burthens, so that <HI>Gama</HI> was convey'd to the Palace in a Sedan. In the Way he was met by some of the Emperors Attendance, all Cloth'd in fine Linnen, who, employ'd for that purpose, march'd orderly before him to the Palace, and then conducting him by the Hand through several Anti-Chambers and Rooms of State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The description of the <HI>Zamarin</HI>'s Palace at <HI>Calicut</HI></NOTE> at every Door and Entry standing ten of the Emperors Guard. He entred at last the Presence, which was very large and stately, the Floor co∣ver'd with a rich and costly Stuff, interwoven with Silk and Gold, the Walls hung with more rich and curious Tapestry; round about upon ascend∣ing Steps, on several Thrones, all Princes, his Privy Council sat. The Empe∣ror, or <HI>Zamarin</HI> himself, clad in white Cotton, embroider'd all over with Golden Roses, ty'd up with handsom Knots, rich with invaluable Oriental Pearl, lay supinely at his ease, leaning upon his Elbow, on a most glorious Couch, wearing a Hat, which rather resembled a <HI>Turbant</HI> of Massie Gold, deckt with inestimable Jewels, sparkling like Stars; a great part of his Arms and Legs were neatly Hoop'd about with weighty Golden Rings, which being Buckl'd sat close; his Toes and Fingers Were cover'd with Jemald-Rings, and Armlets, set with Diamonds: Near him stood an Officer with a flat Plate cover'd with <HI>Betel,</HI> an Herb which the <HI>Indian</HI> Princes continually chew, whose Vertue keeps always a sweet Breath, and better than drinking allays Thirst, correcting Crudities, freeing the Stomach from all Qualms, and the Head from melancholy, disaffecting Vapors. The <HI>Zamarin</HI> being of a black and swarthy Complexion, his Body, tall and burley, his Limbs large and brawny, (for his Arms and Legs were naked) shew'd enough in Counte∣nance and Person, the Majesty of a King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gama</HI>'s Discourse to the <HI>Zamarin.</HI></NOTE><HI>Gama</HI> being commanded to sit, by an Interpreter declared first the occasion of his Address to his Imperial Majesty, that he was sent from his Royal Master the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in his behalf with Salutations, and to kiss his Hand, who endeavor'd, being a great Prince himself, to make amicable Leagues, and everlasting Friendship, with all other Foreign Monarchs wheresoever, and in the first place with him, hearing of his Majesties many singular Vertues, Magnificence and Fame, spread to the utmost Confines of the Universe, he also commanded a Fleet to be Rigg'd and set forth under his Conduct, who now having spent much time, passing through many dangers, an unmeasurable Way, toss'd with all Winds on a turbulent Sea, at last being happily Landed at this long desired Port, and having receiv'd the extraordinary honor and favor of this his publick Hearing and Address, he in the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Name, humbly proposes what he so much desires, that is, not onely an establishment of a well-grounded Peace, and friendly Correspondency betwixt the Princes, but also that his and your People might drive a constant Trade and Com∣merce, which might equivolently redound to the good and profit of both Nations.</P>
<P>Thus saying, with a submiss and comely Posture he deliver'd his Letters, written in <HI>Arabick</HI> and <HI>Portuguese,</HI> with several Presents, which though not cost∣ly, yet their Novelty was such, that the Emperor was strangely taken with several of them, growing to that kindness thereupon, that he proffer'd him all Friendship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Zamarin</HI> shews Friendship to <HI>Gama.</HI></NOTE> promising him of his own accord whatever he desir'd: and then being more inquisitive, entertain'd himself by enquiring of his King, what
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>manner of Person, and the like, then of his Countrey, what, and where it was, and how far distant, desiring to know of his strange Adventures in his so long a Voyage thither: To all these he gave him a brief and handsom account; which no less pleasing, the Emperor caress'd him with a sumptuous Banquet after their manner; both Parties being extremely satisfi'd, <HI>Gama</HI> departed.</P>
<P>The fame of this Negotiation was next day all the News through the Ci∣ty, all sorts of People for the most part well approving of what they heard, onely the <HI>Saracen</HI> Merchants, who were many, and there residing, drove a great and profitable Trade from thence to other Parts; they hearing of this were strangely surprised, being much troubled, lest the <HI>Portuguese</HI> should break in upon them, and carry a great part or all of this their rich Traffick into their own Channel; nay, this would not onely be destructive to their Estates, but also to their Religion, which is very catching, by this means introduced, might prove fatal to many of their Souls.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Saracen</HI> Merchants incense the <HI>Zamarin</HI> against <HI>Gama.</HI></NOTE>These upon a double score, love of Profit, and hate of <HI>Christianity</HI> (to which they bore an inveterate malice) the next morning the primest of them ga∣ther'd together, and went to the Palace with a ready Speech prepared, to draw an odium upon the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> who having ready admittance, their business by their looks and behavior appearing to be serious, and of no small concern, they humbly shew'd to the <HI>Zamarin,</HI> how that these Strangers, who had in a manner surpris'd his Majesty, having no other information of what they were, or their Condition, but from themselves, were indeed not so, and that they had told him nothing but Lyes, for they were able to make out, that they were a Crew of Roving Pyrats and Robbers, and declar'd by their actions common Enemies to all humane Society; and that their King, if they had one, was a petty Prince, far off in the West, who not able to enlarge his nar∣row Territories upon the adjacent Countrey, sent these Hectoring Desperado's through all Seas, to make Booty of what they could either get by Wheedling, down-right Cheating, or the Sword: And if his Imperial Majesty be so plea∣sed to grant them a free Trade and Commerce, that then they would, being so enforc'd, leave <HI>Calicut,</HI> this their settled Staple, and seek Trade elsewhere, which sure would not redound so much to his Majesties benefit, who had so long brought in their Customs and Duties, a certain and great Revenue to the Crown, which they by no possible means, if they deserted the Place, could in many years make the like, or any considerable Return. Thus the business was agitated, and the Emperor inform'd by both Parties.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Malabars</HI> contrive to make away the <HI>Partu∣guese.</HI></NOTE>When the <HI>Malabars,</HI> being by Nature fickle and treacherous, not onely per∣swaded by the <HI>Saracens</HI> how dangerous such alterations would be, but also in∣fluenc'd and encourag'd from the wavering Court, conspir'd, laying a Plot how to dispose of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> otherwise, by their utter destruction: which was not so clearly carry'd, but that <HI>Monzaido,</HI> the <HI>Tunis</HI> Merchant, and a real Friend to the Strangers Interest, scenting the bottom of their Design, inform'd <HI>Gama</HI> of the whole Intrigue; who being very sensible of the danger, made his escape sudden and privately from the City, that he might the better save him∣self and his Fleet from undoubted Ruine; so setting Sail, he left the treache∣rous Harbor for his security, where Cruising at Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Plot is spovl'd, and <HI>Gama</HI> falls upon the <HI>Malabars.</HI></NOTE> he met with an <HI>Indian</HI> Vessel, standing in for <HI>Pandarana,</HI> a safer Port than that of <HI>Calicut,</HI> where the Emperor had formerly advis'd <HI>Gama</HI> to, by whom he sent Letters to the <HI>Za∣marin;</HI> wherein he gave an account, that he was enforc'd for his safety to leave his Harbor, and trust the Sea, a Plot being laid, to take away, not onely his
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>Life, but to seize his Ships, and make Prize of all he had; and that some had so poyson'd his Majesties Ear concerning them, gracious to him before, with lying and scandalous Tales, and other false Aspersions, that he would not ven∣ture any further Commerce, nor have to do with such a fickle and not to be trusted People; therefore desiring, That such Goods as he had there left ashore, might speedily be sent aboard, and he would not trouble his Majesty nor them any further.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Zamarin</HI> excusing himself, laid the fault on his corrupt Officers and Attendants, who were already tryed, and condemn'd to suffer, condign Pu∣nishment.</P>
<P>But whatever his Excuses were, there was no Restitution, and the Goods lay still as Confiscated for the Emperors Use; at which <HI>Gama</HI> being justly in∣cens'd, resolv'd by Reprisal to make up his Loss: And soon after he seiz'd on a <HI>Malabar</HI> Vessel, by chance standing into <HI>Calicut,</HI> in which were six Persons of Prime Quality amongst them: Thus the Emperor being enforc'd to release those Prisoners of so much esteem, deliver'd up all those Goods which <HI>Gama</HI> laid claim to, sending with them also an Answer to the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Letter.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Monzaido</HI> the <HI>Tunis</HI> Merchant (his Kindness towards the <HI>Portuguese</HI> being discover'd) made his Escape from the City (where he fear'd no less than Death, and Confiscation of all he had) for his Safety, to the Fleet; whom <HI>Gama</HI> receiving with all Civility, carry'd him after to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where he (a Convert) receiv'd Baptism, and lived there, being turn'd a <HI>Christian,</HI> Ho∣norably, and in good State and Condition, many Years.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Zamarin</HI> looking upon this as a high Affront, to be force'd thus to his dishonor to exchange Goods for Prisoners, and to be brought to Capitula∣tions, onely three Ships opposing his Mighty and Absolute Power; would not thus sit down, nor take it so; although his own Navy, by which, nay, with a small part, he might have vindicated his Cause, which were there then, by reason of the Annual Tempests hall'd ashore, and could by no means possible be suddenly Launch'd; yet with wonderful dexterity he Mann'd out sixty Boats, with stout and expert Soldiers, who were so Order'd and Commanded, that they were able to destroy and Swallow them all.</P>
<P>He flying, and they pursuing, and just ready to lay him aboard, twenty to every Ship; so it pleased Providence, to befriend him with a sudden Storm, which parted the Fray; they being routed, and forc'd, not without danger, ingloriously to return; and <HI>Gama</HI> coming clearly off, loosing the sight of <HI>Cali∣cut,</HI> Steer'd his Course directly home,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gama</HI> returns home to <HI>Portugal.</HI></NOTE> and in something more than two Years compleating his Voyage, <HI>Anno</HI> 1499. he Anchor'd in the Haven of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where he was receiv'd with great joy; being the first (to his Eternal Fame and Honor) that with an undaunted Courage, passing so many imminent Dangers, found a Way by Water to the so much desir'd <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>After <HI>Gama</HI>'s Return, of whom the King had receiv'd sufficient Information concerning the Profit and Advantage which might be made by the <HI>East-India</HI> Expeditions, did so much encourage him, that he fitted out thirteen Ships, Mann'd with 1500 Mariners, and 500 Soldiers, under the Command of <HI>Pedro Alvaro Caprales,</HI> who had strict Order, That he should endeavour by all means to make a League of Amity and Friendship with the Emperor of <HI>Calicut;</HI> and to request the Liberty of Raising a Fort there, to the end they might there settle their Staple of Merchandise: Which if the Emperor should refuse, nor
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>would be drawn to by any Perswasions, then to endeavor to force him to it by Arms.</P>
<P>Thus having receiv'd his Instruction and Commission, he departed with his Fleet out of the Haven of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and Steer'd the same Course to <HI>St. James</HI> Island, as <HI>Gama</HI> had done before. Then he Sail'd more Westerly, and fell at last on an unknown Coast, which he call'd <HI>Holy-Cross-Land,</HI> since <HI>Brafile;</HI> where Landing, and finding it a fruitful and rich Soil, he cast up a Fort, and sent <HI>Gaspar Lemius</HI> back to <HI>Portugal,</HI> to inform King <HI>Emanuel</HI> of his New Discovery. And leaving the Charge of the New Work which he made there; to some choice Men that he took put of the Fleet, with all Necessaries to maintain it, he departed, directing his Course towards <HI>Calicut.</HI></P>
<P>But in the way he rancountred with such Storms, that he lost four of his Vessels; and glad he came off with no greater damage, Steer'd directly for <HI>Cali∣cut,</HI> where soon after he arriv'd.</P>
<P>Where the <HI>Zamarin</HI> dealing also treacherously with him, they fell at vari∣ance; but <HI>Caprales</HI> play'd his Game so well, that he forc'd the <HI>Zamarin</HI> to pay him double the damage of what his Losses came to: So returning with mean Success, he arriv'd in the Haven of <HI>Lisbon, Anno</HI> 1501.</P>
<P>The same year <HI>Emanuel</HI> plying his Business, set forth three other Ships, under <HI>Johannes Novius;</HI> who meeting with <HI>Caprales,</HI> now in his way homeward, telling him of the fickle and treacherous behavior of the <HI>Zamarin</HI> of <HI>Calicut,</HI> quite dis∣courag'd, supposing such his Labor would prove in vain, return'd with him: So that that Expedition signified nothing.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all these Rubs and Discouragements, his being still more and more out of Purse, and all his Endeavors turning to no account, but only feeding as it were vain Hopes; yet not one jot discountenanc'd, he went on strenuously, and set out the year following a second time <HI>Vasques de Gama,</HI> with ten Ships, conceiving by his well-experienc'd Conduct, he might be more for∣tunate, and might at last set a better face upon the whole Affair; yet he re∣turn'd with little better Success than the former had done: But howsoever, the King went on, and would not be daunted, setting forth <HI>Vincent So∣derio,</HI> next <HI>Stephano Gama,</HI> then <HI>Alphonso</HI> and <HI>Francisco Albuquerque,</HI> and after <HI>Gundissalo Coelio,</HI> with several Fleets; all which return'd but small Audits, in lieu of his vast Expences.</P>
<P>But at last, considering the whole weight of this high Concern lay only upon his Shoulders, and some few of the Nobility; his Merchants and Private Traders, and the whole Body of the People, not at all concern'd: Neither seeming willing, then, or at any time, to be ingag'd, either in their Purse, or otherwise; he bethought himself (observing the Nation to be naturally Super∣stitious, and much inclin'd to hearken to Prophecies, and such Follies of know∣ing Future Events) of a way, a subtile Artifice, to catch the whole People, or at least the Richer sort, with a new Device, or Royal Trepan, which was thus effected.</P>
<P><HI>Hermicus Cajadus,</HI> a Learned and Famous Poet of that Time, being not only witty in his Art, but ingenuous, and trusty to carry on a close Design, King <HI>Ema∣nuel</HI> privately employ'd: They contriving together, what the King dictated, the Poet set down, and soon after at his leasure put it in Verse, and with as cleanly Conveyance, got the whole Matter ingraven in ancient Characters, upon three Stones; which done, he buried them on the Sea-shore, near <HI>Cape Rocha Decin∣tra,</HI> which were there to lie till <HI>Emanuel</HI> gave the Word. The day being ap∣pointed
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>for the Discovery, <HI>Hermicus,</HI> the better to carry on the Kings Business, invited several Friends, Persons of Quality, his Neighbors, who dwelt there∣abouts, to a Treatment at his Countrey-Farm; where when they were merry, amidst their chang'd Dishes and turn'd up Bowls, one that he intrusted, brought him strange News, which was, That where he had been digging for Stones to finish his Worships new Wall, they had found three Stones, with Inscriptions upon them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Discovery.</NOTE> which neither he, nor any there present knew one Letter of; and sure must be of some wonderful Signification. At this they all started up from the Table, left their Feasting, and running immediately to the Place, gaz'd upon the Marbles, all admiring the strange Characters, but none understanding a Tittle thereof; reckoning by the worn and almost de∣fac'd Letters, That the Stones must have lain there many Ages. Soon the fame of this was spread through all Parts thereabouts, which came at last with great wonder to the Kings Ear; but he shew'd himself more amaz'd and strangelier concern'd than the Relater; and very earnest suddenly to see and know what they might signifie, straight commanded the Marbles to be brought to Court. The King then viewing them with greater astonishment, with much ado a good while after got them to be Read and Copied out, finding them to be a Prophe∣cy of <HI>Sybilla,</HI> to this effect.</P>

<P>And order'd them to belaid up in his Treasury, as Holy Reliques, signifying by their Preservation, as the <HI>Palladium</HI> to <HI>Troy,</HI> the Safety, Good, and Utility of the Nation; clearly demonstrating, That the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> being the most West∣ern People, should be them, that by their Conquests at last should Command over the remote <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cheat thereof.</NOTE>This strange Discovery not only spread through <HI>Portugal,</HI> but was more than Table-talk through all <HI>Christendom;</HI> and the Inscriptions every where Copied, and Translated into their several Languages, and many Learned Com∣mentators glossing, and giving the same Opinion thereupon, That the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> were onely destin'd for that Business.</P>
<P>Thus by deceiving of his People, they were undeceiv'd, and brought to a right understanding of the Benefit that would accrue both to him and the whole Kingdom, by a vigorous Prosecution of the Grand Design, so lately and well begun by <HI>Vasco;</HI> in pursuit of which, they might without question make themselves Masters of the vast, and yet unknown Territories of the Ori∣ental World.</P>
<P>Thus, and by this Superstitious Means, the Work went forward on all Hands, every one striving to be foremost, and to joyn their Stocks together, to carry on the Design; By which enabled, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> first conquer'd <HI>Goa,</HI> and there settling their Staple, from thence penetrating every way, they got seve∣ral Footings, making themselves by Conquest Masters of many considerable Places, Conquering whole Kingdoms, bringing from thence a World of Trea∣sure, and also drove the first Trade in our <HI>Japan.</HI></P>

<P>He considering the great profit of such a Trade, and also by that means to lessen the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Commerce, by taking from them such a yearly Revenue, accepted of the proffer; and in the Year Fifteen hundred and nineteen, set him forth with five stout Vessels, all well appointed for a long and new Expediti∣on; leaving <HI>Sivill,</HI> he first directed his course towards <HI>Brasiel,</HI> from thence Coasting on, till he reach'd 53 degrees Southern Latitude; here he discover'd those Straits, which from his name are call'd <HI>Magellan:</HI> In the Mouth of these, one of his Ships Founder'd striking on a Rock, another of his Vessels weary, and horribly disgusting the Voyage, Weighing Anchor, stole from thence by night, and ran away directly back to <HI>Sivill.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Magellanus,</HI> passing with many difficulties these unknown Straits, open'd at last the great Southern Ocean; where also suffering much by foul weather, he came to the Island <HI>Subus,</HI> where he, and several of his prime Officers going a Shore, where invited by the Natives farther into the Countrey to a Treat∣ment; who having gotten them at such an advantage, suddenly, expected Feasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Magellane</HI> murder'd.</NOTE> turn'd to bloody Banquets, and there amidst their Merriment, by the Salvages, they were all barbarously Murder'd.</P>

This their damned Contrivance, though close and clandestinely carry'd, and not many intrusted with the bottom of their Design; yet how, I know not, taking Air, a part of their horrid business came to light.

<P>They after Delivery, in stead of Swathling and wrapping up the Child in warm Clothes, throw it into cold Water to harden; and in stead of comfort∣ing the Mother with some Cordial Broth, they keep them fasting, not suf∣fering them, a good while after their Delivery, to receive any considerable nourishment.</P>
<P>Their manner of Diet is also opposite to ours; whereas we delight in Friends and Strangers at our private Tables, or at least admit Relations and

<P>But two years before the return of <HI>Pais</HI> from his foremention'd Voyage, <HI>John Hugh Luschot</HI> setting Sail from the Haven of <HI>Maccaw,</HI> intending his Voyage for <HI>Japan:</HI> He relates thus;</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Linschot's</HI> Voyage to <HI>Ja∣pan.</HI></NOTE>The 19 of <HI>June</HI> we Weigh'd Anchor from before the Island <HI>des Outcas,</HI> lying on the West side of the Entrance towards <HI>Maccaw,</HI> leaving the great Isle of <HI>Thieves</HI> to Lee-ward, which hath another longer Island full of Woods to the North∣ward of it; and the like shape presents the Isle <HI>Tonquiau,</HI> being naturally forti∣fi'd with ten Cliffs like Bulwarks, but on the North-East side opens a conve∣nient and safe Harbor: We wav'd <HI>Lamon,</HI> standing off to Sea at a great di∣stance, because many Pirats lay lurking up and down, shelter'd under those Coasts, their design especially to seize <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vessels; therefore we Steer'd directly towards the <HI>Chabaquon</HI>-Head, a High-Land, appearing a far off from the Coast of <HI>China;</HI> afterwards we Sail'd the length of the <HI>Red Stone, Varella,</HI> a Rock so call'd , and well known by its colour, which appears above Water, and may be seen beyond <HI>Port Chinogoa;</HI> Soon after we Stemm'd the Isle <HI>Lequeo
<PB N="28" REF="20"/>Puqueno,</HI> whose steep Coasts are about sixteen Leagues in length, under twen∣ty five degrees North-Latitude, where we Sail'd against a Current of trou∣bled white Shells, but after 15 Leagues we found ease: Then rose the <HI>Seven Sisters,</HI> Isles so call'd, from their so much resembling one another; the first appears with a sharp Spire or rising Point in the middle; and at the foot on the West Angle, a Rock opens like a Column or Pillar; on the North-East, mark'd with a black Cliff. The <HI>Seven Sisters</HI> out of sight, we rais'd the long Isle <HI>Ycoo,</HI> full of black or sable Trees; from whence we lay North-East, Sailing betwixt that and <HI>Tanaxuma</HI> through a Channel, clear from all danger of Rocks and Shelves; At the Mouth of which, appears a Mountain like <HI>Vesuvius,</HI> or that of <HI>Aetna,</HI> which vomits upwards hideous Smoke and dreadful Flames, mixt with Stones; the Ruptur'd Bowels of the Mountain, which ejected with no little Fragor, sometimes fills the adjacent Shores, Sea and Land, with terri∣ble Affrights, and wonderful Consternations.</P>
<P>But <HI>Tenaxuma,</HI> an Isle eight Leagues long, hath on the West a good Harbor, fortifi'd naturally with Rocks; the Low-Land full of rising Hillocks, cover'd here and there with black Pines: Eight Leagues Northerly, beyond this ap∣pears the Coast of the mighty Empire of <HI>Japan,</HI> but in the mid-way, Steering to <HI>Jebuxy,</HI> we lay a good while becalm'd; yet nevertheless, the eleventh day after we set Sail from <HI>Macow,</HI> we arriv'd in <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>But besides all these Voyagers, and the many Discoveries and Plantations of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> in either <HI>Indies,</HI> at last the <HI>Hollanders</HI> being thrust into an exegency of dangerous consequence, and forc'd by an overcoming ne∣cessity, also became Navigators, and undertook (to save themselves from utter ruine) that Work, by a business which happen'd thus;</P>
<P>At first, and in the infancy of their Trade, They onely contented themselves with making short Flights, and trafficking to their neighboring Confines, as <HI>France, England, Denmark, Norway,</HI> and other Places in the Northern Ocean; with which naturally delighted, and tasting the sweetness of Profit, they ven∣tur'd farther to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> then growing more bold, enter'd the <HI>Straights,</HI> seeking through the <HI>Midland Sea,</HI> at <HI>Legorn, Genoua,</HI> and <HI>Messina,</HI> what by their several Trades might be more beneficial. Here whilst the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> made such wonderful Discoveries, they fixed and well satisfi'd, sat down and went no farther.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first reasons why the <HI>Hollanders</HI> undertook the Voyage to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE>But after the War was proclaim'd by <HI>Spain</HI> against the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI> issuing out strict Commands, that all Goods that heretofore were Export∣ed from; his Harbors, or Imported from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> whether the Growth of either Countrey, or otherwise, should not onely be confiscated and made seizure of, but great Mulcts, and other Punishments inflicted upon all them that durst, or were so hardy, as to infringe in the least these his special Edicts, supposing by this means sooner to reduce them to his obedience, which hap∣pen'd quite contrary: for by this time, prosecuting <HI>Magellanus</HI>'s Discovery, <HI>Spain</HI> had engross'd in a manner the whole <HI>East-India</HI> Trade, so that his Ports and Harbors were the Staples of <HI>Christendom,</HI> for all manner of Drugs, Spices, and all other Oriental Growths: Thus the <HI>Hollanders</HI> being suddenly block'd up, and cut off from so beneficial Traffick which they made with <HI>Spain,</HI> send∣ing those Commodities which they fetcht from thence through most Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that much astonish'd, looking upon themselves as utterly undone, they began to consider, if any way were possible to be found to deliver them from their imminent destruction; at last, after several Consultations, they be∣thought
<PB N="29" REF="20"/>thought themselves of a means; for having furrow'd up much of the Northern Sea, knowing as far as <HI>Greenland,</HI> they believ'd it not difficult to find a new and shorter Way beyond <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Tartarie,</HI> through the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Anian</HI> to <HI>Japan,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> which by surveying the Terrestrial Globe, could not be above a fourth part of that so long Voyage by the great Southern <HI>Cape;</HI> which if effected, they cast up, that with a quarter of the Charge they might bring the <HI>Indian</HI> Products to their Doors, and be able to furnish at so much lower Rates those accustom'd Places which they formerly had suppli'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Ships of the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> endeavor to find out a Passage to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> behind the North, but in vain.</NOTE>In order to which, <HI>Anno</HI> 1549, they Rigg'd out four Ships, who Sail'd on according to design, till they encountred with huge Floats, and swimming Castles of Ice; and though they were much troubled, incumbred, and in great danger, yet against all this opposition, they reach'd the heighth of <HI>Nova Zembla;</HI> but there being no longer able to oppose, the Ice increasing, covering almost all the whole Sea, they were forc'd to return; so this their first Expedi∣tion prov'd fruitless: Yet not disanimated with their first bad success, they prepar'd that Winter, and towards the latter end of the next Spring, when those Seas might be penetrated, seven Ships more, who after sixteen Weeks, being stopt by the same impediments, return'd with the like account into the <HI>Maes.</HI> Yet though a little troubled with their unfruitful endeavors, they sat not down so, but ventur'd out two Ships more; but this third Voyage prov'd more unfortunate than either of the former, for they lost one of them, being frozen up, and the Company Wintering there, were forc'd to break up their Vessel to build a Cabbin with it on the Shore, where they several Moneths suffer'd by bitter extremities, and a Sunless Skie: the other being much crased and Weather-beaten, was forc'd to return. Thus where they ex∣pected <HI>Mare Liberum,</HI> or open Sea, they found <HI>Mare Clausum,</HI> the great Nor∣thern Bays, by which they hop'd a Passage, all blockt up with Ice.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding all these disasters, and small account of great endeavors, they set forth another Fleet to Trade the same way; and not onely them, but, the business working of it self, several other Merchants began to venture out Ships, freighted on their own accounts: Those and the first joyning their Stocks together, set out eight Ships under the Command of <HI>Jacob van Nek,</HI> and growing impatient, two Moneths before their return they sent out three more, under the Conduct of <HI>Stephen vander Hagen.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Isle.</NOTE>This Island, so call'd by its first Discoverers the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> from the Saint on whose Day it was found, being the 21 of <HI>May,</HI> lies in the Main Ocean, 16 Degrees and 15 Minutes Southern Latitude, about 510 Leagues from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> 350 from <HI>Angola,</HI> and 510 from <HI>Brasile,</HI> being the nearest Con∣tinent to this Isle, is about seven Leagues in Circumference, appearing high above the Water, defended every where from the violence of the Sea, by steep Rocks like a Wall, with Bulwarks, and is naturally Hilly, but cut quite through with many Valleys; amongst which are two exceeding pleasant, as the <HI>Church Valley,</HI> so call'd from a small Chappel built there; on the North∣side of which is an easie and delightful Ascent to the High-lands: towards the South is the <HI>Vale of Orange,</HI> so call'd from the great plenty of that Fruit, which besides Lemons, Pomegranates, and the like, grow there in great abun∣dance, that they may Lade six or seven Vessels with them yearly. On the West-side of the Chappel is good Anchorage, but they must lie near the Shore to keep them from Driving; for from betwixt the declivings of that Rocky Coast, the Wind comes often down with great violence, and sudden gusts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air.</NOTE>The Air of this Island is very temperate and wholsom, insomuch that the Sick which are brought out of the Ships on Shore there, soon recover their health. The Valleys are not more than moderately hot, the Mountains tem∣perately cold, being continually fann'd with cooling Breezes, and the Air is re∣frigerated
<PB N="32" REF="22"/>frigerated with five or six Showres in a day, the Sun shining as oft betwixt; and though the Soil be naturally dry and barren, yet it is replenish'd with many Springs of sweet and wholsom Water, especially the <HI>Church Valley,</HI> through which, descending from the High-lands, glide several pleasant Streams down to the Sea, for the great accommodation of those that Anchor there, and put in forfresh, Water; yet besides this, they have two other, from whence they supply their wants.</P>
<P>This Isle, destitute of Inhabitants, may ascribe its plenty of wild Gattel to a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Merchant, who in the Year 1512 coming to Anchor here, and ob∣serving the pleasant Situation, and the solitariness thereof, which then agreed well with his disposition, being something inclin'd to Melancholly, and ha∣ving been formerly much cross'd in his Fortunes, wearied with business, and the cunning practises of those he dealt withall, settled himself in this solitary Place, putting ashore those Sheep, Swine, and Poultrey he had aboard, which increased in a short time to a Miracle, insomuch that they suppli'd whomsoever touch'd there, with plenty of fresh Provision, and especially after King <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Portugal</HI> issued out strict Commands, prohibiting all his Subjects from set∣ling there.</P>
<P>This Soil, though naturally (as we said before) very dry and thirsty, is much fertiliz'd, being moistned by many Springs and showry Weather, so that it bears variety of Fruits, especially Pease and Beans, of which great store are found growing every where, which when ripe, falling, sowe themselves, ma∣king such plenty.</P>
<P>Here are also whole Groves of Orange, Lemon, Pomegranate, and Fig∣trees, which are always loaden with ripe, green Fruits, and Blossoms; and great Shades of Ebony and Rose-trees: the Wood is not easie to be wrought, because of its knottiness. The Valleys are like Kitchin-Gardens, full of Parsly-Beds, Porcelin, Sorrel, and several other Herbs good for the Pot, and also for many Distempers, especially the Griping of the Guts, a Disease very incident to such as frequent these Parts.</P>
<P>The Woods and Hills abound with all manner of Beasts, as Goats, Deer, some as big as Stags, and also wild Swine of several colours, but very difficult to be taken. When the Portuguese first discover'd this Countrey, they found not any kind of Beast or Fruit-bearing Trees, all which they transported, Stocking and Planting of them there, which since have so spread themselves, that both the Hills and Dales are satiated with them, without any art of Husbandry.</P>
<P>Here are also Partridges, Pigeons, Peacocks, and Pheasants, which cannot be taken either by Snares or Nets, but onely by Shooting. No Beasts or Birds of Prey, Serpents, Toads, or Frogs, have here their receptacle; but ugly Spiders and Flies, some green like Grashoppers.</P>
<P>The Cliffs on the South-side of this Island entertain thousands of gray and black Sea-Pies, or Mews; also speckled and white Fowls, some with long, and some with short Necks, which lay their Eggs (being of a good relish) in the Rocks. These kind of Fowls the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> 1608 in a Voyage to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> call'd them by <HI>Irony,</HI> Mad-Pies, being so tame and gentle, that they took them with their Hands, or knockt them down with their Sticks.</P>
<P>Here the Sea-water which beats against the Rocks, remaining in a frothy foam upon them, whitened with the Sun, becomes pure Salt, and Salt-Petre.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="22"/>
<P>Here are also Mountains which produce <HI>Bolus,</HI> and a fat gray Earth call'd <HI>Terra Lemnia,</HI> such as comes from <HI>Lemnos.</HI></P>
<P>In the South-east part of this Island is a Mountain, whose Earth being of a brightish brown, Dyes a good Red; and also one in the East, which yields a pure mixt colour, being brown above, and white below.</P>
<P>The Sea near this Island abounds in Fish, but must be taken with Hooks, and not with Lines or Nets, because of the foulness of the Ground; Carps, but of another colour than those of <HI>Europe;</HI> Eels, about the thickness of a Mans Arm, and of a good taste; Crabs, Lobsters, of better r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llish than those in <HI>England;</HI> and also very good Mussles, which stick so fast to the Rocks, that they must cut them off.</P>
<P>This Isle, though thus flourishing, lies still uninhabited, for they say that the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> would permit none of his People to settle there, or appro∣priate to themselves, but to be left free and open, to relieve those that Sail that way.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Popes Answer by <HI>Anthony Buradapulius.</HI></NOTE>After this was done, <HI>Anthony Burapadulius</HI> made in the Pope's behalf this Answer, which in brief was thus:</P>
<P><HI>That the Kings had done exceeding prudently and religiously, and were highly to be commended for thus sending their nearest Relations in an Embassy so expensive, long, and dangerous, to visit his Holiness at</HI> Rome, <HI>Gods Vicegerent, and true Successor of</HI> Peter <HI>the Apostle, the Head of the Catholick Church, and Keeper of the Keys of Heaven, by which means he hopes the whole Nation may be absolutely reduced to the Christian Faith, without which none can be saved; and happy would it be for them, changing for Salvation their abominable and heathenish Superstition, to offer in the Temple of Christ, rather than in their</HI> Dayro, <HI>or</HI> Pantheon, <HI>not of Gods, but Devils; and that they ought to give the Almighty thanks for the holy</HI> Xaverius, <HI>who by his Doctrine and pious Perswasions, brought them first to hearken to everlasting bliss and happiness, and true welfare of their Souls; which saving Faith hath already of late powerfully operated on many Nations, both in the West and East-Indies, who had time out of mind been led in Ignorance, and blinded with the abomination of Idolatry, now following Christs Banner, are profess'd Enemies to the Doctrine of Devils.</HI></P>

<P>So the Trade lay in a manner open to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> which they being al∣most solely employ'd in, made so great an advantage thereof, that they were able every three years to send Gratulatory Embassies, with several rich Pre∣sents to the Emperor.</P>

The Woods also have no want of Phea∣sants and Pigeons. The Ground being fruitful, produceth store of Sugar, Gin∣ger, Cinamon, Coco-Nuts, and several other Necessaries fit for humane suste∣nance; besides, full of populous Villages. They are Govern'd by several Lords, not depending nor acknowledging any Superior, so that each Town being a Republick, they still have Wars and are at difference one with another, Town against Town, Village against Village, insomuch that Peace never set foot in that Isle.</P>
<P>Of their many Villages, the prime and of chiefest note, are <HI>Sinkan, Mandauw, Soulang, Backeloang, Taffacan, Tifulucan, Teopan,</HI> and <HI>Tefurang;</HI> the last in a Val∣ley near the High-lands, where <HI>Fort Selandia</HI> stands, formerly call'd <HI>Tyovan.</HI></P>

Not∣withstanding the fruitfulness of the Soil they commonly live in want, being extreme lazy, tilling no more than they suppose will supply their necessity; which often falling short, they are so hardly put to it, that when they per∣ceive Provision growing scant, they live sparingly many days, or else they
<PB N="47" REF="31"/>might be utterly famish'd; for in such exigencies they never help one ano∣ther: nay, they are so supinely slothful, that the Women do all the business of the Field, Plough, Sowe, and Reap, having neither Horses, nor any other Cat∣tel to help them; the Drudgery being the more, because they make it Gard∣ners work, for onely with Shoes they dig and turn the Glebe; and where their Corn grows thickest, especially Rice, they pluck it out with their Hands, and set it where they find the Blades come up thinner; and in Harvest know∣ing neither Scythe nor Sickle, which tries their patience, cropping it with a Tool like a Pruning-Knife Stalk by Stalk, a Span below the Ear; which with∣out Threshing they store up in their Houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they order their Rice.</NOTE> hanging it in the Evening in small Bundles over the Fire; and early in the Morning the Women rise and Pound so much as will serve them that day for their lazy Lord and Family.

<P>This Isle is not stor'd with such Wines as other Places in <HI>India</HI> have, which their Trees produce; but they have another sort of Liquor, that inebriates no less than the <HI>Indian,</HI> or Juice of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Grape; which they prepare in this manner: They take a quantity of Rice, which they put in a Vessel made for that purpose, and boyl it; then turning it out, they knead it into little Balls, or Pellets; when they are well chew'd they put it into another Pot, there let∣ting it stand till grown sowre; to this they pour a good quantity of Spring-water, which being so put together, works a Moneth or two, for so long it will ferment; which done, it becomes a clear, pleasant, wholsom, and strong Liquor: the longer they keep it, the better it grows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Liquor in <HI>For∣mosa.</HI></NOTE> for it will hold good thirty years. The top of this Liquor is thin and clear, the bottom, or sede∣ment thick like our Pap: the thin makes their Drink with which they often Fuddle; the thick makes their Cawdle to recover, which they eat with Spoons after their Recovery. This they carry with them to the Field, and take a Dose thereof when they think fit: and thus yearly they spend most part of their Rice.</P>

Sometimes in the Night they break into a House or two, which leaving, their business being done, two of the Party stick fast in their likeliest way to return, so to stop the Pursuer, sharp-pointed Reeds, about half a Yard long, they making their Retreat by another im∣probable way.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strang ordering of their Dead.</NOTE>¶ THe manner of disposing of their Dead, and Funeral Obsequies, are thus: When any dies, the Corps being Laid out, after 24 hours they elevate it upon a convenient Scaffold, or Stage, four Foot high, Matted with Reeds and Rushes, near which they make a Fire, that so the Corps may by degrees dry: to which Place the Friends of the Deceased daily flock toge∣ther, and that they may keep up sorrow the better, bring along with them store of Mans-flesh, and several strong intoxicating Liquors. But before the sick Person departs, being just ready to give up the Ghost, thus they begin their inebriating grief: One beats on a Drum made of a hollow Tree, which gives notice of a Person deceased; at which Summons the Women come from all Parts near, bringing Pots and Vessels of strong Drink with them, and ma∣king themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Dancing.</NOTE> and the Relations of the Deceased, Drunk. They Dance all Night before the Door after this manner: They take a Trough like a Chest, but longer and broader, and turning the bottom upwards, the Women get up, and two by two, Back to Back, move their Legs and Arms in a Dancing time and measure; which pace, or taboring tread, sends a kind of a murmur∣ing, or doleful sound from the hollow Tree; when these mounted Couples are weary, they come down, and others supply the Place: thus the Maudlin-Drunkards Dance nine days together, whilst the Body lies parching by the Fire, sending forth a very noysom stench: then having bathed the Corps▪ nine days over, they wrap it up close in a Mat, and lay it higher than before, so co∣vering it with a fitted Canopy from all light, there lying three year, till such time as nothing remains but a Skeleton, all else being consum'd to Dust; then they Interr him in his own House, with all the Ceremony of Feasts, as if lately departed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How strangely they or∣der their Sick.</NOTE>¶ THe ordering of their Sick is no less unnatural and preposterous, for they use them worse than if the Devil were their Doctor; for in stead of Potion or Pill, and the like, they use but one Medicine for all Disea∣ses, and that's a dry Halter, especially in the Village <HI>Teopan,</HI> for as soon as any Person falls sick, and begins to complain, lying down, and not able to walk about and follow his business, they presently prepare a tough Cord in stead of Cordial, so putting the Noose about his Neck, they hoist him up to the top of the House with a Pulley kept for that purpose, then let him suddenly fall with a Jolt, which commonly proves immediate Cure by killing of them; yet some mend upon this choking Medicine, either by the strength of Nature, or their spirits irritated by the fright.</P>

<PB N="53" REF="34"/>from Generation to Generation: for certain young Men are appointed to be in∣structed from the elder; and faithful Memories are their onely Registers and Records. First they believe the Universe, Heaven and Earth, to have been without beginning, and shall be without end; next the immortality of the Soul; for which reason they build a little Place, in which they put a Tub of Water with a Dish in it, before the Door of the Deceased, supposing the Spi∣rit thereof comes daily thither to bathe or cleanse. The next Article of their Faith is, that there are several Punishments after this life, according to the equality of their Crimes, and Rewards of eternal happiness for those that have, when living, merited by doing well: therefore they dig broad and deep Trenches, filling them with Mud and Slime; over, which they make a floating Bridge of bundled up Rushes, which leads to the most delightfullest and luxu∣rious Vales in the Countrey: over these, as they affirm, the Souls of the De∣ceased must pass, which the Wicked endeavoring to cross, the unstable Truss, or rowling Bridge, tumbles them over into their Stygian Lake: but the Just and Godly walking in safety over, enjoy there all pleasure in an everlasting Elysium.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What they account sins.</NOTE>Those sins which they account most hainous, are but frivolous toys, built upon Superstition and sleight Observation, as not to go naked (as we said be∣fore, at their set and appointed times; to wear Clothes or any thing of Silk; Women to bear Children before their 37th Year; to fetch and eat Oysters not in due season; and to venture to undertake any business, though of little or no consequence, before they have observed good Auguries from the Notes or Language of the Birds: All these are Capital, and as they hold forth, unpar∣donable Offences; but Murder, Theft, Lying, and Forswearing, these have their Qualifications, for some may commit them, and some may not, without any scruple; but in general they are look'd upon no more than peccadillo's, and venial Offences.</P>
<P>When they take an Oath, they ratifie it by breaking a Straw. To be a publick and common Drunkard, and to be an Adulterer and debaucher of young Women, if carry'd privately, is no harm.</P>

<P>Another Deity which they worship out of fear, because <HI>Tamagisanhach,</HI> as they say, creates Men with comely Visage, and well proportion'd Bodies; this being an angry and ill natur'd Power, delighting in mischief, makes it his whole business to, spoil and misshape what <HI>Tamagisanhach</HI> hath made fair and handsom, disfiguring their Faces with Pox and Blasting, bunch∣ing their Backs, withering and crooking their Limbs, and the like, then deriding at their lameness and deformity: so this <HI>Sariafing</HI> they hold in great veneration, that he would be pleased to spare them, and do them no harm.</P>

This Combustion first brake out in the Province or Kingdom of <HI>Suchu∣en;</HI> and though but small at first, yet afterwards the whole Empire was in∣volv'd in the like Flames, and Publick Calamity; which thus happen'd:</P>
<P>This Countrey hath a Tract of barren and inaccessible Mountains, which formerly were sculking Receptacles for a few guilty Persons that had commit∣ted Theft and Murder, and other such hainous Offences;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Robbers in <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> after it became the <HI>Asylum</HI> or Sanctuary for all sorts of petty Criminals, such as Cheaters and Bankrupts, who suppos'd the open Air better than a close Prison; then Hector∣ing Debouchers made there their Summer-Progress; next, all sorts of Vagabonds, fearing the Whip, flock'd thither; and at last, those that were pinch'd with Poverty, and not inamour'd with Labor, betook themselves also to this kind of idle Life: So growing numerous, they began to draw down in Bodies, Attaquing whole Villages, and carrying away the Booty to their Dens and obscurè Recesses in the Mountains. Thus flesh'd and encourag'd, deserting the Hills, and their former Aboads, they pitch their Camps in open Plains,
<PB N="56" REF="36"/>and spoiling where-ever they came, soon over-run that whole Province, and left nothing to Conquer but the Metropolis <HI>Chinghi;</HI> not questioning (such was their audacious Resolution) to make themselves Masters of that Rich and Populous City: Which they had done, and without any great difficulty, but that a Woman, a <HI>Virago,</HI> inspir'd with more than a Masculine Spirit, by her Courage, Care, and Conduct, so baffl'd them in all their Endeavors, giving them Repulse upon Repulse, that at last, with Loss and Dishonor, they were forc'd to quit their Enterprise, which had wholly dissipated their whole Army; when two Commanders of the Imperial Forces, then drawing thither from <HI>Queichew,</HI> utterly to quell this horrid Insurrection, fell at variance betwixt themselves; and the Difference grew so high, that one of them to be reveng'd of the other, quitted his Loyalty, and carry'd over his whole Brigade to the despairing Rebels; who thus reinforc'd, joyning together, set on the Empe∣rors remaining Party; in which Battel, satisfying his Revenge, he not onely slew the General his Antagonist, but they beat the Vice-Roy of <HI>Tutang,</HI> and rout∣ed his whole Army: But yet soon after, he bestirring himself, recruited so his Forces, that though he could not utterly dissipate them, he brought them to Conditions, and to pay him double the Damage of what ever they had gain'd in that Predatory War.</P>
<P>But the Rebels, when thus languishing, having nothing left but the Moun∣tains which first foster'd them, retreated thither; when about that time, all things in a manner setled, several of the Northern Provinces of <HI>China</HI> were in∣fested with the destroying Plague of Locusts, which covering the whole Coun∣trey, devour'd what ever was fit for Humane Sustenance, bringing an extreme Famine:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Famine.</NOTE> which the Rich were able to bear out; but the Poor were so driven to the worst of Exigencies, Starving, that they every where, stirr'd up by the Example of those of <HI>Suchuen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">It makes Robbers.</NOTE> fell to pilfering and stealing; and gathering at last into Parties, to Robbery and Murder; setting, in like manner, upon whole Towns and Villages: And soon after, they form'd eight several Ar∣mies, selecting those they thought most likely, and fittest for Valour and Con∣duct, to be their Commanders; who growing skilful, (practising dayly Mar∣tial Discipline) suddenly brought these great Bodies in good Order and Array.</P>
<P>With these marching, as they had well-design'd, several ways, they made themselves Masters of whole Kingdoms and Provinces, none being able to withstand such an universal Inundation of Arms: And thus making the whole Riches of the several Countreys which they enter'd, their Spoil, they gather'd up an inexpressible Mass of Treasure; by which enabled, as they then thought, to wage War with the whole World, having in their hopes already devour'd the vast Empire of <HI>China;</HI> all which perhaps might have been done, had they unanimously joyn'd to carry on the Work together;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Robbers in <HI>China</HI> fall at variance amongst themselves.</NOTE> when their eight Generals, every one of them stirr'd up by Ambition, began to contrive how he might be Lord and Master of all, and either destroy, or make the rest his Inferiors.

But the <HI>Tartar,</HI> not a little troubled at such his Greatness and Power, nor being able to redress himself at Sea, having no Fleet of his own; since Strength would not prevail, us'd Policy, promising him, if he would come in, and be as a Friend, to make him King of two Kingdoms, <HI>viz.

Such as they thought not handsom, they more disfigur'd; putting out their Eyes, cutting off their Noses, and driving them in that lamentable condition to the Fort <HI>Zelandia.</HI> Others they hew'd in pieces; to which miserable end came also three <HI>Dutch</HI> Ministers, <HI>Anthonius Hambrock, Arnoldus Vinsenus,</HI> and <HI>Peter Mus.</HI> These and the like Cruelties they us'd, and others such as were never heard of by any. The first Assault they made, was upon the Fort <HI>Kelang;</HI> which being too weak to resist against so powerful an Enemy, the Besieg'd were forc'd to a Surrender. The <HI>Chineses</HI> being encourag'd by this their good Success, march'd next to <HI>Zelandia,</HI> which was Fortified with three double Walls, standing upon an <HI>Isthmus</HI> between <HI>Formosa</HI> and the Island <HI>Baxambaya.</HI></P>
<P>Close by, and under the Command of the Fort, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had setled their Residences.

Before the Fort stood a Bulwark, just behind the place of Execution, against which the <HI>Chineses</HI> cast up a Platform, which did much hurt to the Fort <HI>Zelandia;</HI> and also took the Bulwark before the Castle, in which a hundred <HI>Chineses</HI> were blown up into the Air: for the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> upon their departure from the same, left lighted Matches in their Store-Chamber, where the Powder lay, which took Fire just at that instant when the <HI>Chineses</HI> enter'd. But this Loss of theirs, cost the <HI>Hollanders</HI> dear: For though soon after there arriv'd five Ships from <HI>Batavia,</HI> to the Relief of <HI>Zelandia,</HI> against the <HI>Chineses;</HI> yet they had such ill suc∣cess in their first Attempt, that going ashore on <HI>Baxombaya,</HI> to Storm a Fort which the <HI>Chineses</HI> had newly cast up, they were so roughly entertain'd, that they were forc'd to Retreat,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollanders</HI> are beaten by the <HI>Chineses.</HI></NOTE> with the Loss of Three hundred and eighty Men.</P>
<P>Upon this their so great Defeat, <HI>Coxengo</HI> sent in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Minister, one of his Prisoners, to <HI>Frederick Cojet,</HI> who Commanded <HI>Zelandia,</HI> advising him with all speed to deliver up the Town and Castle; which if he refus'd, and obstinately stood out, he would without Mercy put all his Prisoners immediately to the Sword: But the Governor would not so deliver up All, and such a Charge as he was intrusted with; and so slighting his Threats, sent his Refusal: Upon which, <HI>Coxengo</HI> finish'd the bloody Massacre which he had begun, putting all the Remainder of the Prisoners to the Sword. Yet <HI>Cojet</HI> (though much trou∣bled at the loss of so many of his Countrey-men) stoutly defended the Fort against all their Forces; till his Men wearied with continual Duty, being daily Storm'd and Assaulted on all sides, tir'd and out of heart, he not being able to hold out longer, Surrender'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cojet</HI> delivers up <HI>Zelan∣dia</HI> to the <HI>Chineses.</HI></NOTE> The Articles were these: <HI>That the Besieg'd might in safety go aboard their Ships: That whatever Prisoners were taken since the Massacre on both sides, should be exchang'd; and the Fort</HI> Zelandia, <HI>with all the Treasure, Ammunition, and whatever else belong'd to it, to be deliver'd.</HI> Where <HI>Cox∣enga</HI> found ten Tun of Gold, forty Pieces of Ordnance, and other things of great Value.

The Land lying low, and they Strangers to the Coast, they were much troubled; and the Pilots seeing more Islands opening near the Mouth of the Bay of <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> growing more diffident, stood again to the <HI>Offin,</HI> where they discover'd two <HI>Japan</HI>-Vessels, Steering Southward; and making towards them, they were forc'd (being over-power'd by the Gale, then growing fresher and fresher) to leave their Design of Intelligence: But soon after they descry'd another <HI>Japan</HI>-Vessel, to which drawing near, and Hailing, not understanding one another, they lost that Labor also.</P>
<P>When early on the eighteenth day, the Point of <HI>Nangesaque</HI> appear'd North-North-East, about five Leagues and a half distant; and the Island <HI>Goto,</HI> North-North-West: By which Position of the Course, they knew they were in the right Channel, which would lead them safely to the Harbor; and by Night they reach'd the Point or Promontory of <HI>Nomoo,</HI> which extends it self South-West along to the Bay of <HI>Arima.</HI> Thus they wrought themselves up within four Leagues of <HI>Nomoo,</HI> lying North and by East, in thirty Degrees Northern-Latitude, from thence plying Easterly onely with their Fore-Sail.

According to the great Consequence of this Embassy, an answerable Train and Equipage was pre∣par'd; but being not well setled, since their coming from <HI>Firando</HI> to <HI>Nange∣saque,</HI> their Store-houses were as yet out of order; so that there was a confusion in the carrying on of their Procedure: And though <HI>Nangesaque</HI> is a more Rich and Populous City, and more resorted to than <HI>Firando,</HI> yet that Island had better Conveniencies, and fitter for the <HI>Hollander</HI> to Trade upon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Castle <HI>Firando.</HI></NOTE>¶ THis Countrey produces nothing worthy, nor any thing to show, but the Castle in which <HI>Firandano,</HI> Brother to the Lord of the Island, in∣habits. The Castle stands amidst a pleasant Mead, to which they pass over a Bridge of blue Slate, which leads unto the Base Court, guarded on each side with a File of Musquetiers. The Gate is cover'd with a double Penthouse, one a good distance beneath the other: The opposite Jaumes are adorn'd with the Emperors Arms, and those of their Noble Family. The Castle standing upon a Hill, shews it self in Prospect at a great distance, because its Tower or Spire being seven Stories, tapering in a Pyramidical Form, appears afar off. Upon each side of the Castle open eight Doors, by which, on Steps cut out of the hard Rock, climbing the steep Ascent, they enter through several Doors to the Palace. Below are four Arbours of Pleasure, or Banquetting-houses, standing on square Pillars, built round with Galleries, and a <HI>Cupiloe</HI> on the top. This is all that <HI>Firando</HI> boasts.</P>

<P>But they were much troubled, whilest they were preparing to go upon this Embassy, being inform'd, that never any had Audience from his Imperial Ma∣jesty, if they did not open their way with rich and costly Presents before∣hand.</P>
<P>It seems not here amiss to say something concerning the Description of the Countrey, Customs, and Character of the People; from a good Author, <HI>Johan∣nes Petrus Maffeus.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jon Peter, Maffeus, Histo∣riar, <HI>lib. 12. Description of</HI> Japan.</NOTE> commonly call'd <HI>Japan,</HI> says he, is not one, but three Islands, whose Skirts or Margents are sprinkled round with many lesser.</P>
<P>The greatest and wealthiest stands divided into three and fifty Provinces, or petty Kingdoms, the chief City call'd <HI>Meaco,</HI> gives its denomination to that Isle.</P>
<P>The second Island call'd <HI>Ximus,</HI> divides it self into nine Principalities, whose most eminent Cities are <HI>Vosuquim,</HI> and <HI>Funaium.</HI></P>
<P>The third Division or Isle is <HI>Xicocum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Division.</NOTE> and hath onely four Vice-gerents, and famous for the City <HI>Tosa;</HI> so that the three Isles of <HI>Japan</HI> number 66 King∣doms, all subordinate under one Emperor.</P>
<P>The whole Countrey extends in length almost 200 Leagues;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigness.</NOTE> the breadth not answerable to the length, for the broadest part not being above thirty Leagues, and the smallest but ten; its circumference is not yet well known: and lying in a manner North and South, extends it self from thirty two, to eight and thirty degrees of Northern Latitude:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borders.</NOTE> The East looks towards <HI>Nova Hispania,</HI> but at 150 Leagues distance: The North Buts upon <HI>Seythia</HI> or <HI>Tar∣tary,</HI> and other unknown Countreys: The West views <HI>China,</HI> but far off, for from <HI>Liampo,</HI> a City standing on the most Eastern Point of <HI>China</HI> to <HI>Goto,</HI> being the most Western Island of <HI>Japan,</HI> where first the Ships arrive, makes sixty Leagues, and from <HI>Amaccen,</HI> on the most Western Harbor of the East-side of <HI>China,</HI> to the foremention'd Isle, is 290 Leagues. The South lies border'd with the wide washing Ocean, at great distance, unknown Territories, whence, they say, a strange People were drove by foul weather on the Coast of <HI>Japan,</HI> which setling there, never return'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soil.</NOTE>¶ THis Climate, for the most part, is Snowy and cold, and the Soil not very fruitful; Rice, which is their general Food, and grows most plentiful there; they Reap in <HI>September</HI> their Harvest, for other sorts of Grain in many places is in <HI>May,</HI> which they Bake not to make Bread of as in <HI>Europe,</HI> but eat it soft, being boyl'd to a Pap, or Gruel: They have several warm Springs or Baths, which cure (as they say) many Distempers.</P>

The other call'd <HI>Figenoiama,</HI> reaches (as some report) several Miles, Perpendi∣cular above the Clouds, and middle Region of the Air.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> live on Veni∣son.</NOTE>¶ THe <HI>Japanners</HI> neither breed nor keep Sheep, Swine, Geese, nor Poultry, nor eat scarce any other flesh but Venison; the Desarts are full of wilde Cattel, and untamed Steeds, of a good race: The Woods are full of Wolves, Bores, Stags and Conies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts, and Fishes there.</NOTE>Amongst their several sorts of Fowl, they want not Pheasants, Ducks, wild Pigeons, Turtle-Doves, Quails, and Partridges. Here they have also abun∣dance of Fish, amongst which the Eells, and what they call <HI>Voom,</HI> they most esteem: Butter they know not, nor the use of Sweet Oil, but what they spend is prest out of Whales, which are often driven ashore upon their Coast. The meaner sort of People use neither Tallow nor Wax, but carry up and down to light them Branches of Pine Trees, in stead of Candles and Torches.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their shape and strength.</NOTE>¶ THey are something tall of Stature, and well Set, and easily endure Watching and other hardships, signs of a strong Constitution. From twelve to sixty years of Age, they are liable to Musters, Impresses, and Mar∣tial Affairs.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Japanners</HI> are a strong People.</NOTE>They much exercise their patience in all manner of sufferings, and are so in∣ur'd by Custom, that Hunger, Cold, Heat, and Thirst, Watching and Tra∣vel are their Play-Fellows; for as soon as born, though the weather happen to be extream cold and pinching, they carry out the Infants, and wash them in the Running Streams, where whilest they are cleansing, they let them paddle in the Water to save themselves from sinking: So soon as Wean'd, their first Lesson is the Art of Hunting, kept from their Mothers, and all Female Relations; their Schools of Learning, wherein they commence in Hardiness, are wild and unfrequented places, believing, that nothing makes them more ten∣der and effeminate, than to be near Women.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of sleeping and eating.</NOTE>¶ THe Floors of their Houses are Matted all over very curiously; and that they may tread the softer, stuft like a Quilt, which indeed, are rather their Couches or Beds, where laying themselves down, under their head in stead of a Down-Pillow a Log or Stone, whereon they well and quietly Repose.</P>
<P>These Mattings are their Tables also, on which, sitting cross Legg'd, they take their Repast:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are very politick.</NOTE> Yet in their Diet, they are no less curious or dainty than the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and like them use two Sticks, one in each hand, with which they take up their Hash'd Service, needing neither Knives nor Forks, which they handle so dexterously; and these Tools are so fitted for their purpose, that they never let any thing fall, nor foul their Fingers; entering their Dining-Room, for the more cleanliness they pull off their Shooes. The meaner sort, especially those that live poorly, near the Coast, fare hard, eating onely Rice, Fish, and Sallets; but the Inlanders Feast daily, and feed plentifully like the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rich Feasts.</NOTE>In stead of Table-Clothes and Napkins, their Dishes are serv'd up on little Boards or Tablets, being either Pine or Cedar, curiously Painted after their manner with various colours: Their prepar'd Dishes are heap'd up with va∣riety of Meat, like our Bisks or Olapotreeds, trick'd up with Leaf-Gold, the edges stuck about with Cyprus Branches: But when they Treat Noblemen, they gild the Bills, Feet and Leggs all over with Gold: They entertain their Friends and Strangers Chearfully, with hearty Welcome.</P>
<P>During their time of Eating and Drinking, they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e several Customs which they perform with strange and Mimick Gestures, the whole Nation every where punctually observing the like: The Blood of the Grape is altogether unknown to them, but in stead thereof, they make their Wine of Rice; but above all, they are most delighted with Water heated, mixt with the Powder of <HI>Chia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Drink is made after a peculiar manner.</NOTE>In nothing they are more curious and diligent than in making this Com∣pound, which the Grandees themselves pride to prepare, when they entertain their Friends; for which purpose, to make this their special Liquor, they have peculiar places in their Houses, where in a kind of Furnace over a gentle Fire, it stands infusing, from whence when they are visited by Strangers, lifting up the lid, they take it up in Dishes, and present it hot, trowling the Cup about one to another.</P>

<P>Their last Complement which they are most proud of, is to shew them their Wealth, boasting their accumulated Treasure: But their foremention'd Drink the <HI>Japanners</HI> esteem and value, more than we our Precious Stones, and Inesti∣mable Jewels.</P>
<P>They also set a strange Rate upon Sword-Hilts, especially when made by some peculiar Masters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses and Cloy∣sters.</NOTE>Most of them dwell in Houses of clinch'd Wood, cover'd with slit Plankings, because of the frequent Earthquakes which happen there, so with falling, they suffer not much harm, and are soon repair'd; some dwell in Edi∣fices built of Stone, no less Costly than Artificial.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Japanners</HI> Tongue is very strange.</NOTE>¶ THe <HI>Japanners</HI> have one Tongue or Language in common, yet it is so various in Pronounciation, that it seems to be of several and distinct Dialects, for they use no Adjectives to their Substantives, as we do, but by va∣riety of words, they understand the matter to be good, bad, or indifferent, or what ever else; nay, more than this, they have several Tones, or Accents in their Speech, which are sharper or flatter like our Musical Notes, by which they distinguish their meaning: But their Princes speak by themselves in a Com∣manding manner, or in an Imperative Dialect; the Common People in a low∣er Stile; in brief, the Men and Women use not one Mode of Speaking. More∣over, Their manner of Writing is far different from their Vulgar Colloque, and they use one Character in their Writing, and another in their Printing, which are so different, that they nothing resemble: Their Books are also numerous, which are either Divine, Moral, or Heroick: Besides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As also their Character.</NOTE> they have one Letter or Character, which signifies a Word, nay, sometimes whole Sentence, not unlike the <HI>Chinese,</HI> or the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Hieroglyphicks, from whence the <HI>Japan</HI> Tongue is most difficult to be learn'd or understood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Arms.</NOTE>¶ THey much delight in War: Their Arms, besides Guns, Bowes, and Arrows, are Faulchions and Daggers, which they begin to wear, and exercise at twelve years of Age; their Faulchions or Scimiters are so well wrought, and excellently temper'd, that they will cut our <HI>European</HI> Blades asunder, like Flags or Rushes, the edge neither rebated nor notch'd.</P>
<P>They have also Javelins Tipt with Gold or Silver, and their Pikes, which are longer, but lighter than ours, they know how to handle very dexterously.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They often change their Apparel.</NOTE>They change their Clothes and Habits with their Years; when they are past their Puberty, and accounted of full Age, they wear a Coat or Tunick of various Colours, reaching to their Ankles, with which they go loose within doors; but going abroad, they tie it like long Breeches about their Legs, and gird about their middle, over which they wear a short Sleev'd Vest, by the <HI>Ja∣panners</HI> call'd <HI>Quimon.</HI> This manner of Habit, in Summer they wear very fine, and in the Winter a courser, stuft very curiously, or Quilted.</P>

White, which through all the known world is counted the best Colour of Teeth, and though theirs being naturally Ivory, they disdain so much, that they make them artificially Ebbony, and the black∣er, the prouder they are of such a Beauty: And having the Spirit of Contra∣diction so much, that as we Mounting on the left side, they get up on the right side of a Horse; and as we vail our Hats when Saluting, they uncover their Feet, putting off their Shooes; As we rise, shewing our respect to Friends, or Persons of Quality, Saluting with Congees and the like Postures of Reverence, they sit down and take State upon them, so receiving the Addresses; and as we set a high Rate and great Value upon Pearls, Jems, and other Precious Stones, they look upon them as Whitings-Eyes, and Pebbles, admiring and gi∣ving Rates for old Iron and Earthen Ware; and as we have our Physick well prepar'd, the acerbity or other ill tastes taken off with Correctives, they take them simple in their own likeness, able to kill our Horses; and in stead of nourishing up their Sick with light Meats, fit for digestion, they stuff them up with course Feeding, not sparing to give them any sorts of Fish, either fresh or salt; and whatever the Patients Distemper be, they neither let Blood, not know the saving use of Phlebotomy. They are so grounded in these their con∣trary Customs and Manners, and so strongly opiniated in, that if any ask why they do so, they will not onely answer, but dispute very stifly in maintaining their Cause.</P>

These are Shaven, both their Heads and Chins, and live single, using all the Formality and Gravity, both in their Speech, Looks, and Gesture, of those that are truly Religious: Under which appearance of Sancti∣ty, they commit all the Outrages of Lust, Avarice, and Revenge, but the blinded People, believing that they are Miracles of Piety, spare no cost to Maintain these Saint-seeming-Devils. These, amongst their other Functions, take special care in ordering of <HI>Obits,</HI> and Noble-mens Funerals, not onely as Church-men, but in the manner of Heralds, setting them forth with all Order and Ceremony, and going before the Herse, Singing new Elegies in honor of the Deceased.</P>
<P>These are of several Orders and Societies, but they are all generally call'd <HI>Bonzi,</HI> most of them being of Noble Extract, and younger Brothers of Hono∣rable Families, forc'd by Necessity, take Orders upon them.</P>
<P>In <HI>Japan</HI> are also several Schools and Colledges for the Education of Youth, on which are setled great Revenues for the Maintenance thereof.</P>
<P>These Religious Persons were formerly in highest Repute amongst them, but since the Preaching of the Gospel, by which Doctrine their Vizards have been taken off, discovering them in their own horrible likeness, they have not onely lost much of their antient Reputation, but are rather abhorr'd and hated by the People, their once so much admirer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citizens are of the third degree amongst the <HI>Japanners.</HI></NOTE>The third degre and honor are the Gentry, the Burgers, or Magistrates of Cities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tradesmen the fourth.</NOTE>The next are Tradesmen and Artificers, which are exquisite in their man∣ner of Work. In the principal Towns are kept many Heralds-Offices, and Printing-Houses.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Husbandmen the last.</NOTE>The lowest degree are Husbandmen, and those that follow Countrey af∣fairs; these by reason of their Poverty are subservient to the Rich, which in∣deed are very numerous.</P>
<P>These People have several Vertues: First, they are generally good natur'd, of a kind and affable Disposition, of quick Apprehension, have ready Memo∣rie, and nimble Fancy, exceeding not onely many of their own Eastern Peo∣ple, but our Western, in solid Judgment, and aptness of Learning, insomuch that the Rusticks and their course-bred Children, appear rather like Gentle∣men in their courteous and civil behavior, and other deportments, than to be a Race of churlish Clowns.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are quick of Ap∣dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ion.</NOTE> They much sooner get the mastery of the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue and any other curious Arts, either Mechannick or Speculative, than our <HI>Europeans.</HI> To be poor is accounted no dishonor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Patient.</NOTE> nor are they much dif∣ferenc'd from others, by contempt, or taking notice of. They keep their House always clean neat; which done, they dress themselves accordingly, then walk abroad and make Visits. They abhor all manner of railing, or using loud and contumelious Language, Theft, vain Swearing, and such like Debaucheries. They fare covetous of good Fame, and fair Reputation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Covetous of Honor.</NOTE> and therefore also bear a Respect beyond belief to their Superiors, and all those under whose Authority they are.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Will su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er no Reproach.</NOTE> They are impatient in Points of their Ho∣nor or Honesty call'd in question, not enduring what tends to their affront or disparagement; and a false Accusation seems as bad to them as if condemn'd for a Criminal: therefore the meanest of them have a care to shew a Respect to one another at their meeting, never speaking ill, or calumniously in their
<PB N="68" REF="42"/>absence. The Nobles spend most of their discourse in praising and extolling each other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are very faithful.</NOTE> commemorating still their many worthy Acts, and several Vertues: Nay, the meanest Handicraft, or Day-laborer, if any be minded to Hire or Emyloy them in such Drudgery, if they speak not civilly, and with respect to them, they will in a Huff refuse their proffers, and scorn their business. They behave themselves the most warie, and with greatest care, to avoid all Dis∣sentions and Quarrels, or the least Dispute; and if they have any antient Grudge, they never express it by their Tongue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hide their Anger.</NOTE> but by their Looks, shewing onely a sad, or discontented Countenance; and rather than controvert their Cause, whether right or wrong,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They never go to Law.</NOTE> and put to Arbitration, they will sooner lose it. They think it becomes not the Grandeur of any Person of Honor to speak much, or be talkative. Upon these accounts it happens, that there is neither Rangling, nor any Quarrels amongst the Common People passing through the Streets, nor the least Dissention betwixt Man and Wife, Parents and Children, Master and Servants; thus ordering their Affairs with all quiet and silence: and if any small Breach chance to happen, Friends make it up, and imme∣diately reconcile: And when they punish any Malefactors (which happens seldom) they forbear all opprobrious and foul-mouth'd Language.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They never Scold.</NOTE> They have neither Courts of Judicatory, or any other Laws, as we in <HI>Europe:</HI> They lay up their private Revenges to spend in War against their publick Enemies. When they meet by chance together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Never complain of incon∣veniencies.</NOTE> or sitting at their private or publick En∣tertainments, none ever complains of his misfortune or trouble, either at home or abroad, nor of his Crosses or Losses in any Concern whatsoever; and have a wonderful faculty, to vail with a glad and cheerful Countenance their pinch∣ing griefs, and heart-eating sorrows: Thus they never molest or vex one ano∣ther with unnecessary and untimely Complaints, to the disturbance of the whole Company: Nay, if their Friends enquire of them what's the matter? they put it off with a well-feign'd Smile, or give a slender account of the busi∣ness, as not worth the mentioning: But if (which seldom happens) any be falsly accus'd, or scandalously reproach'd, whatever they suffer inwardly, they bear it with a setled and unchang'd Countenance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why they are so patient.</NOTE> as not concern'd in the least tittle thereof. We may judge these Qualications of their springs from a greater prudence, and better temperature of spirits, considering the inconstan∣cy and vicissitudes of humane Affairs; for sure oftner than in any other Coun∣trey, alternate Fortune setting up, and casting down, raising Beggars to the Throne, and tumbling Kings from thence to the lowest step of poverty, plays her Jokes, now flattering, as soon frowning, by which, being so vers'd and practis'd in, they always remember in their greatest heighth, the lowest con∣dition, and stand prepar'd with an untroubled willingness, ready to receive any alteration, as if look'd for long before: But these you would believe not to be acquir'd Vertues by age and experience, but rather natural, which ap∣pears by their Children; for they shew by their Looks and Conversation, that they have a magnanimous Soul.</P>
<P>But these their good Qualifications they shew not always, for they stand tax'd with as many Vices, insomuch that all which we have said before, may be thought rather to be a counterfeit and well acted Part as in a Play, than otherwise.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they make Men gods.</NOTE>Though their gods are numerous, yet still they add, and make more of their Princes: for when any King, famous and much honor'd for his great Exploits and valiant Atchievements, deceases, they also, in the midst of their Funeral Solemnities, Instal, and Register in the Lift of their Deities, paying them ever after Divine Worship, as the antient <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> did so several of their eminent Hero's, they having gods much resembling these, such as <HI>Mars, Bacchus, Venus, Mercury,</HI> and others, making them first Examples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wickedness of the <HI>Ja∣panners.</HI></NOTE> after call upon them as Protectors in their hainous Debaucheries, as Lust, Drun∣kenness, and the like.</P>
<P>Amongst other seeming Vertues, one especial ability they have, their Looks and Gestures still denote them to be the onely practisers of Piety and pure Zeal, when their Bosoms swell with projects of all manner of mischief: and where they bear the greatest, and most inveterate malice, resolving to be se∣verely reveng'd, there they Smile and Fawn, and in their Speech, Face, and Gesture, express nothing but their dear respects, love, and honor that they bear them: This is so common amongst them, that whosoever deals plain and honestly, speaks as he thinks, and performs what he promises, becomes a mocking-stock, and their onely May-game.</P>

<P><HI>The</HI> Japanners (saith he) <HI>are so capaciously apprehensive, and so tractable, not onely easily yielding to Reason, but Matters of Faith, that when they come to us, are very inquisitive and earnest to be resolv'd in some hard Questions of Religion, when we had first presented them the original and immortality of the Soul, they were soon brought to an un∣derstanding and belief thereof: And when we set forth to them, That none could be sav'd, nor Salvation granted by any, but the Father of all things, and Omnipotent Maker of Heaven and Earth; by which Arguments they were so suddenly convinced, and their former Reasons, which led them on in their blind Superstition, so totally routed, that without any farther scruple, or asking time to consider, they abominated their old Idolatry, and were converted to good Christians; which after receiv'd, they never waver'd not stagger'd from, most of them so resolv'd, that they become Champions for</HI> Jesus Christ, <HI>and were ready to lay down their Lives in maintaining the Truth of the Gospel. Neither are they obtuse, or ignorant in putting their Questions, but will smartly examine, and answer Logically, as if they were, Casuists, concerning deep Mysteries in Divinity; insomuch, that since</HI> Xaverius <HI>Landed here, which is now five Moneths, he hath been daily visited by the</HI> Bonzi <HI>and the Laiety, Conferring from Morning till Midnight, asking and disputing several Questions con∣cerning our Belief: First,</HI> What God is? What his Power? Where he dwells? Why not visible? How it is possible that the Soul hath a beginning, as we affirm, and no end? <HI>Furthermore,</HI> says he, <HI>as the</HI> Japanners <HI>account themselves most apprehensive, and also full of Fancy, so they believe they are in their serious Affairs not infe∣rior to any Nation of the World: upon which account they are so elevated in their own opi∣nion, that meeting any Stranger, they give him onely a scornful glance, and with their Hand a go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by, as if too mean for their Conversation.

But before we
<PB N="75" REF="74"/>proceed any farther from <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> let us take a short view of the Situation thereof.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of <HI>Nange∣saque.</HI></NOTE>¶ THis City stands in thirty Degrees Northern-Latitude, near a con∣venient Harbor, fitter for the Reception of Merchant-Vessels, than any other Port or Haven in <HI>Japan:</HI> It is both great and populous, but without Walls or Fortifications, as most Cities in <HI>Japan</HI> are.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Towns and Chur∣ches.</NOTE>The Steeples and Turrets, which appear very high above the ordinary Houses, give the Town a stately and delightful Prospect, especially towards the Sea, where they have an open view of the Streets, where are many magni∣ficent Buildings.</P>
<P>The City is divided with several Streams, and joyn'd together with as ma∣ny Wooden Bridges.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Every Street is parted by a Gate.</NOTE>The Streets are unpav'd, and therefore in rainy Weather very foul and cloggy; every Street hath a great Gate, which is shut every Night, and guarded with a Watch, so that growing late, there is neither Theft, Murder, nor any other Outrages committed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Houses of <HI>Nange∣saque,</HI> how built.</NOTE>Their Houses are commonly uniform, but the Materials which they Build withall, differ according to the ability of the Builder. They use commonly Wood: but the poorer sort raise their meaner Habitations with Walls of Rice-Straw, Loam'd over with Clay, which closes so well, that it easily keeps out Rain and Wind; yet the richer sort Plaister their Partitions, raising the Foundation four Foot high from the Ground, with Planks cover'd over with thick Mats curiously sew'd together. They are but sleight built, four-square,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why they build them not high.</NOTE> and for the most part as broad as high; which to prevent the ruine by Earth∣quakes, that are frequent in that Countrey, they raise them no higher. Their Roofs are almost flat, but something sloaping; jetting out beyond the Wall four Foot, like a Pent-house; under which is an Entry, or Passage, that leads to their Gardens, which are adorn'd with artificial Rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardens.</NOTE> and still flourish∣ing Trees; which in a pleasant Prospect they view from their Dining-Rooms. The foremention'd <HI>Cantilivers</HI> defend those that walk the Streets both from the Sun and Rain, like our Pent-houses; these and the whole Roofs are of Planks clinch'd one over another, which carries off the Rain easily. On these stand Troughs and Tubs, fitted to receive the Water, to be ready against accidental Fires. They dwell all in the first, or lower Story, for the second and upper∣most is so low, as scarce fit to lay their Lumber in.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Towns and Cities are very subject to Fire.</NOTE>Their greatest and smallest Villages being being thus built all of Wood, suffer much, and sometimes unvaluable Losses by Fire; therefore the richer sort, and those that are able, build apart Stone Ware-houses, where they lay up those Goods and Commodities they most prize. Whatever Houses are burnt down, they immediately build up again in the same manner of Wood, which the Forrests plentifully supply. They seldom use Stone, because if over-thrown by Earthquake, they become a great heap of Rubbish, which they would not be troubled to remove.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Noble-mens Build∣ings are very stately.</NOTE>The Gentry, or better sort, have large and fairer Houses; where the Hus∣band and Wife have their several Apartments, in which they live asunder when they please; and also Rooms for his Employment, and for Address and Entertainment. Their Dining-Rooms are set forth with Cupboards of Plate, Cups and Dishes, that they shew glorious like a Goldsmith's Shop, and Gilded, giving a more various pleasure to the Eye, than our choicest <HI>European</HI> Pictures.
<PB N="76" REF="48"/>But the Walls of these Halls and Parlors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Japan</HI> Structures, after what manner.</NOTE> in stead of Hangings, are cover'd with Paper Painted with Imagery, the Sheets being so curiously glew'd, that no Man can discern where they are conjoyn'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Shutters.</NOTE> Some of these Halls have artifi∣cial Shutters, which opening, show little Closets, and small Retirements; but these Doors, or Places to be open'd, are so neatly Wrought, that none can per∣ceive but it is a firm and perfect Wall: but over the half-Pace, or uppermost part of the Hall, stands a large Picture, done to the Life, under which a Pot al∣ways supply'd with sweet-smelling Flowers, gather'd fresh from their own Gardens.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Housholdstuff of the <HI>Japanners.</HI></NOTE> Along the Walls to sit upon, in stead of Chairs and Stools, they have Chests curiously Varnish'd after their <HI>Indian</HI> manner, and Dishes which they esteem precious, standing upon them, to drink their beloved <HI>Chia</HI> in: Besides all this, they hang up upon their Walls their Scymiters, and other Arms, which they use in Battel. This is the best and richest Furniture which they have be∣longing to the Grandees, and Persons of most Quality: the poorer sort garnish their meaner Habitations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Houses, how in the out-side.</NOTE> each according to their degree and ability. But the Frontice-pieces of their Houses are but plain and ordinary, yet they are uni∣form, and in a direct Line; their Streets being but narrow and short, of which they reckon up eighty eight;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How many Streets there are in <HI>Nangesaque.</HI></NOTE> reckoning as many Gates, being Lockt up every Night, and at each a strong Guard with Lights attending; where none may pass,<NOTE PLACE="marg">None go through the Gates in the Night.</NOTE> unless he bring a Sign'd Warrant from the Governor, without which neither Doctor to his Patient, nor a Widwife to a Woman in Labor, though upon Life and Death, are admitted to go through: Nay more, if any of these Streets happen to be on Fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the time of Fire one Street may not help ano∣ther.</NOTE> they must not expect any help from others, but save themselves by their own care and diligence, for neither cries nor tears, nor loud complaints of those ready to be destroy'd and con∣sum'd to Ashes, prevail'd not in the least, nor move their Neighbors nor Go∣vernors to open and bring them assistance in this miserable condition, so that oft it happens, that the whole Ward, Men, Women, and Children, are burnt together in one Funeral Pyle. This sad Fate had like to have happen'd to some <HI>Hollanders,</HI> lodging in one of these Streets, twenty Houses all burning at once, and many People destroy'd in the Flames before their Eyes; who when they saw no hopes that the Gates would be open'd, and they must sud∣denly with the rest endure the fiery trial, brake by force through a back-side, having a Wooden Fence, so escaping that dreadful Conflagration. It often chances, that though their Locks and Keys keep out neighborly assistance, yet they keep not in the Fire, but that breaks through, and many times destroys not the next Ward onely, but the whole City, leaving it prostrate smoaking in its own Ruines; which suddenly, as we said before, they re-build in the same manner, the adjacent Forrest being ready to furnish them with several sorts of Wood and Timber, and the like Materials for that purpose.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardens about Nange∣saque.</NOTE>This City also lies surrounded with large and pleasant Gardens, so delight∣ful, that the Eye seems never enough satisfi'd with viewing; where all manner of Fruit are much improv'd, growing very prosperously, especially the <HI>Chinesie</HI> Apple transplanted thither, and all sorts of Pears, where they have Walks sha∣ded with Cedar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cedars.</NOTE> whose lofty Crowns seem to salute the Skie; the single Bodies of which make Columns for their Temples, and Main Masts for their Ships of the greatest Burthen, or Sovereigns of the Sea.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Temples in <HI>Nangesaque.</HI></NOTE>Their Temples also are of Wood, built commonly forty Foot square, with Spires and Steeples, curiously Carv'd and Gilt; of which they have many, and though no larger, yet pleasant and sumptuous with Imagery work: on each

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inhabitants of <HI>Nan∣gesaque,</HI> their Shape and Apparel.</NOTE>The Inhabitants are whiter than other <HI>Indians,</HI> but sallow to those of <HI>Europe;</HI> have strong and well-compacted Bodies, and are healthy of Constitution; their Noses are flat and <HI>Camosi'd;</HI> their Eyes little, especially the Womens.

<P>But ere we convey the Ambassadors further through <HI>Japan,</HI> it seems not amiss to take a short Survey, the better to give you a Description of this Large and Potent Empire.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Division of the same.</NOTE>¶ <HI>JApan</HI> is divided into five Provinces, <HI>Jamaystero, Jetsengo, Jetsesen, Quanto,</HI> and <HI>Ochio;</HI> besides the Isles <HI>Saykok,</HI> and <HI>Chiccock. Maffeus</HI> calls <HI>Saykok, Xi∣mum,</HI> making that seven Provinces; but <HI>Francis Cairon,</HI> being an Eye-Witness, deserves more to be credited: He affirms, That several Kings Govern there, and also in <HI>Chiccock,</HI> one King, and three Vice-Roys. That part of this Coun∣trey that is call'd corruptly <HI>Japan,</HI> boasts two Metropolitans, <HI>Miaco,</HI> and <HI>Jedo. Maffeus</HI> also tells us, That this hath fifty three Kingdoms; amongst which he names <HI>Miaco</HI> and <HI>Amangutium,</HI> saying, <HI>Miaco</HI> consists of twenty three, and <HI>Aman∣gutium</HI> of thirty Kingdoms; but of late all these petty Kingdoms are fallen into the Lap of one Sole Monarch or Emperor, who keeps his Magnificent Court at <HI>Jedo.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Japan</HI> also, besides <HI>Saykok</HI> and <HI>Chiccock,</HI> lies surrounded with several lesser Isles, as <HI>Hiu, Tacaxuma, Iquicuchi, Canga, Firando, Meacxima, Oeno, Cocyque, Beroe, Oqui, Murgan, Avans, Mettogamma, Meho, Mianisinu, Sando,</HI> being full of Silver Mines;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vulcans</HI> Isle.</NOTE> and <HI>Vulcania,</HI> often ejecting hideous Flames to the Sky, lying to the West, beyond the <HI>Straights of Diemon,</HI> which washes the Isles <HI>Chiccock</HI> and <HI>Tacaxuma.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Territory of <HI>Ochio.</HI></NOTE>¶ <HI>OChio,</HI> the North-East Territory of <HI>Japan,</HI> borders on the vast Wildes of <HI>Jesso:</HI> For the Inlet or Bay which divides them, runs not up above forty Leagues, there ending, stopt by the Mountains of <HI>Ochio.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the great Countrey <HI>Jesso.</HI></NOTE>¶ THe Extent of <HI>Jesso,</HI> being Mountainous, and abounding with costly Furs, is yet unknown, although the Emperors of <HI>Japan</HI> were much concern'd, taking great pains about the Discovery thereof, to that purpose im∣ploying several Persons at his own Cost and Charges, who made search over Rocks and Mountains, and almost inaccessible Places, explor'd vast and wild Countreys, very far; but found no end, though they diligently inquir'd of the People, who being Salvages, could give them no Account further than
<PB N="79" REF="49"/>where they dwelt. So after long Toyl and Trouble, they were forc'd to re∣turn without any Effect of their Design, as we said before.</P>
<P>The Jesuit <HI>Lodowick Frojus,</HI> in his Letter of the eight and twentieth of <HI>Fe∣bruary,</HI> 1565. to the <HI>Indian</HI> Fathers, writes thus concerning the Inhabitants of <HI>Jesso: Against the Northermost Part of</HI> Japan, <HI>about three hundred Leagues from</HI> Me∣aco, <HI>is a very large Countrey, full of Salvage People,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inhabitants of <HI>Jesso</HI> are horrible People.</NOTE> <HI>which are Cloth'd in Skins of Wild Beasts, Hairy all over their Bodies, having exceeding great Beards, and long Whiskers or Mustachioes, which they turn up with Sticks made for that purpose when they drink. They covet, and are very desirous of Wine; also Valiant in War, and therefore much fear'd by the</HI> Japanners. <HI>If by chance they receive any Hurts in an Encounter, their onely Appli∣cation is Salt Water, with which they bathe and wash the Wound, so drying it up. On their Bosoms they wear Looking-Glasses, which serve them as Shields or Breast-plates. Their Swords they tye about their Heads, in such a manner, that the Hilt thereof hangs on their Shoulders. They onely Worship the Moon.</HI> Aquita, <HI>a great City, stands in the Territory of</HI> Genuaen, <HI>bordering</HI> Jesso: <HI>Hither the Natives come in great Numbers to Trade; and also the</HI> Aquitans <HI>Travel to them, but not in such Multitudes, because they are oftentimes cut off, and murder'd by the Inhabitants.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Error of the Geographers concerning <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE>¶ THe Maps of the World, our Terrestrial Globe, have till of late plac'd nothing beyond <HI>Aquita</HI> but the Ocean; though long since confuted by <HI>Hugh Linschot,</HI> proving upon the testimony of the Jesuit <HI>Frojus,</HI> who deserves to be more credited (as having resided a long time in <HI>Japan</HI>) than some of our Geographers, who set down by hear-say the Largeness and Ex∣tent of <HI>Japan,</HI> without any Proofs or Testimony; whereas it is made mani∣fest, That <HI>Japan</HI> extends it self much further than commonly drawn: More∣over, <HI>Francis Cairon,</HI> Ambassador to the Emperor of <HI>Japan</HI> at <HI>Jedo,</HI> witnesses, That the Largeness of this Countrey is not known to the Inhabitants them∣selves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mistake of <HI>Maffeus</HI> and <HI>Cluverius.</HI></NOTE>Therefore <HI>Maffeus</HI> is much mistaken, when he sets down the length of <HI>Japan</HI> to be two hundred Leagues, and its greatest breadth but thirty. And <HI>Cluverius</HI> in his Geography reckons the length to be an hundred and fifty Leagues, and the breadth seventy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hazarts</HI> ignorance con∣cerning the Description of <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE>But none more errs in this, than the Jesuit <HI>Cornelius Hazart,</HI> in his History of the Island of <HI>Japan;</HI> which that we may the better answer, hear his own Words. Japonien, <HI>or (as others call it)</HI> Japan, <HI>by the Inhabitants,</HI> Nippon, <HI>is a Territory lying in the farthest Point of the East, being the outmost Borders of</HI> Asia; (which to prove, he quotes <HI>Isaiah, cap.</HI> 18. <HI>ver.</HI> 2.) <HI>For although to the West, to the Frontiers of</HI> China,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Isaiah.</NOTE><HI>is no more than fifty Leagues,</HI> (says he) <HI>and to the City</HI> Amacoa, <HI>two hundred ninety se∣ven; and on the South having so vast an Ocean, no known Countrey being beyond,</HI> Japan <HI>may certainly be call'd</HI> The Worlds End: <HI>And standing divided into so many small Islands, that a</HI> Geographer <HI>of our times calls it also</HI> A World of Isles; <HI>the chiefest of which are,</HI> Niphon, Ximus, <HI>and</HI> Xicocus, <HI>consisting of sixty six several Kingdoms. The Isle of</HI> Niphon <HI>reckons fifty three, boasting also many stately Cities, of which the Metropolis is</HI> Meaco. <HI>The Island</HI> Ximus <HI>hath nine, and several handsom Towns, amongst which,</HI> Usuquin, Funai, <HI>and</HI> Cangoxima. <HI>The Isle</HI> Xicocus <HI>accounts no more than four Kingdoms: Which being taken together,</HI> Japonien <HI>is as big as all</HI> Italy.</P>
<P>Though this his Style be ridiculous, yet his Ignorance, and so strangely false Description, is so much more, that he ought rather to be pittied and laugh'd at, as one distracted, than to be answer'd; but that we are bound in Consci∣ence
<PB N="80" REF="50"/>to undeceive his believing Readers.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hazart</HI>'s false Descripti∣on <HI>Japan</HI> contradicted.</NOTE> First, he plants <HI>Japan</HI> on the West side of <HI>China.</HI> This is such a blind, nay such a stupid Mistake, that the like was never heard of: For, was there ever any Writer or Geographer, that settled <HI>Japan</HI> West from <HI>China?</HI> All agreeing, neither can it be otherwise, being an Isle, but East from <HI>China;</HI> that Empire being not onely the utmost Borders of <HI>Asia</HI> Eastward, but of <HI>Europe</HI> also; being one continu'd Main Continent, Westward to <HI>Gads Pillars,</HI> and the <HI>Atlantick Ocean.</HI> Next, admit it were, as he affirms, That <HI>Japan</HI> lay West from <HI>China;</HI> yet out of what <HI>Chinese</HI> Haven did ever any Vessel reach any Port in <HI>Japan,</HI> measuring but sixty Leagues? Where∣as it is notoriously known, That the Distance betwixt these Empires is much greater: And who can shew me in any Map or Journal of his Travels, a City call'd <HI>Amiaco,</HI> lying at such a distance from <HI>Japan,</HI> as he gives, without any proof or testimony? Next (which is very strange) he says, That <HI>Japan</HI> looks on no Countrey Southward, but the Main Ocean; or else, Lands so far off, that they are utterly unknown. What then will become of all these Coun∣treys; as, <HI>Tanaxima, Lequeio Granda, Formosa, de Philippines, Mindore, Mindanao, Borneo, Celebes, Molucco,</HI> and other Realms; besides many other Countreys which are cut off by the Ocean, and lye far and near distant from thence, and daily frequented and Navigated by Strangers, insomuch that all Geographers men∣tion the same? Which belongs more especially to you, who have publish'd in∣stead of grave Experience, your no want of Ignorance, and utter Deficiency in that Science: For what can be more absurd, than this your Description of the Principal Islands, <HI>Niphon, Ximus,</HI> and <HI>Xicocus,</HI> dividing of them into sixty six Kingdoms, and setling them all so handsomly, with a perfect Mistake, on the wrong side; not consulting <HI>Francisco Cairon,</HI> who being himself upon the Spot, took an exact Survey of <HI>Japan,</HI> which your Church-History makes truly manifest in several Pages.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> is much bigger the <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE>Lastly, Of all Comparisons, this seems the most odious, That <HI>Japan,</HI> with all it circumjacent Isles, is no larger than <HI>Italy:</HI> For the same <HI>Cairon</HI> (whom concerning other Matters you have for the most part copy'd out, and trick'd up this your <HI>Japan</HI>-History with) tells us in the beginning of his Description thereof, That beyond <HI>Quanto,</HI> a Territory lying up high in <HI>Japan,</HI> (from whence the Emperor raises his chiefest Revenue, and keeps his Court in <HI>Jedo</HI>) it is twenty seven days Journey before you come to the Province of <HI>Sunguar,</HI> lying in the most Northerly part of <HI>Japan.</HI> At this rate, how can <HI>Italy</HI> be compar'd to <HI>Japan?</HI> Sure Father <HI>Hazart</HI> you neither know the one, nor the other: For let any one take the Extent of <HI>Italy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Largeness of <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> which they reckon from the <HI>Alps,</HI> and the City <HI>Aosta,</HI> passing through <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Capua,</HI> to <HI>Rhegio,</HI> and the <HI>Promontory de Army,</HI> he shall never make more than two hundred twenty five Leagues: And though the breadth along the <HI>Alpine</HI> Mountains reacheth a hundred and forty Leagues, yet taken generally, it proves much less; for betwixt <HI>Ancona</HI> and the <HI>Tyber</HI> gives the rate of the common breadth, which is no more than thirty four Leagues.

<P>¶ NOw to what concerns the Extract or Original of the <HI>Japanners,</HI> the general Opinion thereof we have already related, which was, That they (not unlike the <HI>Batavians,</HI> who by a Civil War were drove from <HI>Hessen,</HI> to the Island between the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Wael</HI>) Rebelling against their Emperor in

Moreover, the <HI>Chinese</HI> Book of their Annual Accounts, reckons, that this Province can bring five Millions seven thousand two hun∣dred and seventy Men into the Field. But although the <HI>Japanners</HI> do so much resemble the <HI>Chineses</HI> in several of their Customs, yet they also imitate the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> in many of their Fashions; for they not only shave their Heads after their manner, leaving but little Hair; but they use also the Letters <HI>D</HI> and <HI>R,</HI> which the <HI>Chinese</HI> Speech doth not acknowledge.</P>

<P>After a short refreshment, the Ambassador <HI>Caron</HI> Weighing Anchor, with a fresh Gale from the North West, about Midnight enter'd the <HI>Straits</HI> of <HI>Camono∣siky,</HI> whose Banks on both sides are continu'd Streets, being full of Houses: here they were forc'd to produce their Pasports, which done, they left this place, and after some time met with such a hollow Sea between several scatter'd Isles, that they were necessitated to get into a small Harbor of a Fish Town.

<P>Here they left the City <HI>Bignatum</HI> on their Larboard, and ran East North East by the City <HI>Oussimato,</HI> and came in the Evening to <HI>Muro,</HI> where the <HI>Bonjoyes</HI> of <HI>Nangesaque</HI> commanded the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Interpreter to inform them, who those were that were travelling to the Emperor.</P>
<P>Out of this Harbor, Ambassador <HI>Caron</HI> set Sail with a Train, besides his own, of above a hundred <HI>Japanners,</HI> and soon after reach'd the City <HI>Akas,</HI> where they encounter'd with a loud Storm out of the North East, furrowing up a very hol∣low Sea.</P>

<P>On the utmost Point or Promontory of the River stands the King's Custom-House, where all Ships must touch that pass by the same, there paying such Customs as belongs to their <HI>Cargo</HI> with which they are Freighted: this House rais'd each Story with a several Roof, shews very stately, and is to be seen far into the Sea.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountains near <HI>Osacca.</HI></NOTE>On each side appear two rising Hills, which hinder the Prospect of the East and West side of the City; onely some of the high Spires appear above.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Water-Castle <HI>of</HI> Osac∣ca.</NOTE>Opposite to the Custom-house stands the Kings Block-house, surrounded with a strong Wall rais'd out of the River, ready and fully replenish'd for all Occasions with well-mounted Cannon. The Emperor <HI>Xogunsama</HI> began to build this Fort; but his Son <HI>Toxogunsama,</HI> succeeding him in his Imperial Throne, <HI>Anno</HI> 1629. finish'd and Garison'd it in the space of three Years.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Store-houses against Fire.</NOTE>Behind the same are built ten Store-houses, opposite to the Sea, with a broad Street, and a Stone Cause-way. These Ware-houses are exceeding large, and built all of Stone, that they may not suffer Damage by Fire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Imperial Turrets.</NOTE>There are also several Towers, in which the Emperor keeps his Treasure, collected from the Isles <HI>Chiccock, Saycock,</HI> and <HI>Tonsa.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these foremention'd Buildings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water-Gate.</NOTE> is also seen the <HI>Water-Gate,</HI> through which the Custom'd Goods go in and out, having a great and broad pair of Stairs, which descend to the Sea, and a Guard of five hundred Soldiers con∣stantly attending the same.</P>
<P>Somewhat further is the Emperors Ship-yard, which is of a great Circum∣ference, having many Docks in the same, wherein continually all manner of Vessels are a building, whose Hulls they make generally very broad. The other part of the City stands behind the Hills; but is divided from them by a Rivulet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Governors House.</NOTE> A little way up the River from the Sea, is the Governors House, curiously built, and within full of costly Rooms, and rises aloft, in manner of a Steeple, with four Roofs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Temple of Devils.</NOTE>Between this Edifice and the Block-house appears the lofty Roof of the

Over his Breast hangs a Scarf, which is parted in the middle: and that which makes it the more terrible to behold, are four out∣spread Arms, of which one of the left stands upwards, holding a Ring on the longest Finger; the other hanging downwards, holds a Flower not unlike a Lilly. The uppermost Right Hand gripes fast a small Dragons Head, spit∣ting Fire; the lowermost, a Golden Scepter: trampling with his Feet upon the Belly and Thigh of another Devil, which lies along under him: He ha∣ving his Head all hairy, and a pair of Ox Horns graffed thereon, with an Iron Chain about his Neck, a Girdle with great Buttons about his Middle, a long Tail between his Leggs, and broad Garters about his Knees; the Right Arm stretch'd out, and the left bended in to his Side, is as dreadful a Spectacle as the other. These horrid Shapes they nominate <HI>Joosie Tiedebak;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they call them.</NOTE> and God they call, contrarily, <HI>Joosie Goesar.</HI> The <HI>Japanners</HI> honor and worship these resem∣blances of Devils with all manner of Offerings, to the end they might not receive any hurt from them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Image of their Devil <HI>Vitziputzli.</HI></NOTE>The same Opinion have the Western <HI>Indians</HI> of their Devil <HI>Vitziliputzli,</HI> whom they Worship and Reverence with great Zeal. This <HI>Vitziliputzli</HI> sits on a Silver Foot-stool, which stands upon a Bier, whose four ends have as many Props, with Serpents or Adders Heads fix'd on them. The Forehead of this Idol is painted blue, with two Streaks of the same Colour athwart his Nose, running to each Ear. His Head like a long-Bill'd Bird, is impalled with stately Plume of Feathers, the tip of the Bill of massie Gold. In his Left Hand he holds a white round Box, and five white Plumes, pleited cross-ways over one another; in the middle a Branch, which signifies Victory. On his Side hang four Arrows, which (according to the Opinion of the <HI>Mexicans</HI>) were sent him from Heaven: His Right Hand rests on a Staff, in manner of a Ser∣pent, painted with blue Streaks: Upon his Bosom appears the Face of a Man, with glaring Eyes, a high Nose, and a wide Mouth, opening before or near the Orifice of his Stomach. Thus stood he, for the most part vail'd with a Curtain; his Body almost cover'd with Chains of Pearls, Diamonds, and other Precious Stones, which hung round with various colour'd Plumes, like Labels.</P>

Between both his Ears hang many Gems of great Value; and about his Neck an Em∣rauld, that covers most part of his Breast; also wearing Golden Armlets: On his Navil a costly <HI>Topaz;</HI> his Left-hand bearing a Fan of Gold, being a Plate so curiously pollish'd, that it well perform'd the Office of a Mirror or Look∣ing-glass, by the <HI>Mexicans</HI> call'd <HI>Itlachcaia,</HI> wherein they believe <HI>Tezcatlipuca</HI> sees all the Transactions of the World, by which he Judges, Determines, and Pu∣nishes or Prefers every one according to their well or ill doing: Therefore he stands ready with four Darts, to distribute upon those which commit the high∣est Offences.</P>

Nor finish'd she her Progress, till the Priest had fully inform'd her, of the several Impieties raging and reigning everywhere; which done, she driving into a Lake, as weary of this World, suddenly vanish'd, never appearing more; and all the Retinue that belong'd to her, following the Chariot, in like manner drown'd themselves: From whence arose that kind of mad Zeal and frantick Desire, of thus ma∣king themselves away by Water, that so they might meet with the Pleasures of the other World.</HI></P>

four <HI>Netherlanders</HI> and <HI>Bongois</HI> on Horseback, a hundred Bearers, appointed onely to carry and look to the Presents, the Silver Vessel, great Looking-glass, and many other Rarities. The Ambassadors went in several Sedans, being attended in all by three hundred Men, and a hundred twenty eight Horses.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Journey to <HI>Menco.</HI></NOTE>With this Train the Ambassadors came about Noon to the great Village <HI>Fi∣raskatta,</HI> where they Dined; and about four a clock they travell'd through <HI>Jon∣da,</HI> which is a small City, curiously built, Fortified with a strong Castle, and surrounded with Walls. The Governor of this Place came to meet the Am∣bassadors, who having a considerable Train, was carried in a Sedan, and fol∣low'd by some of his Guards. All the way which they pass'd was on a high Bank, verg'd with Rice-Fields so far as could be discern'd. At that time it was every where Frozen very hard on the top of this Bank; and in going down the same, they Travell'd through several Villages, and the Way it self was planted on both sides with Trees.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Japan</HI> Cedars.</NOTE>Amongst these the Cedars rais'd their lofty tops above all the others, to an exceeding height. <HI>Theophrastus</HI> relates, <HI>That the</HI> Syrians <HI>and</HI> Phenicians <HI>us'd Ce∣dars for the Building of their Ships:</HI> The same Custom is at this day in <HI>Ja∣pan,</HI> and no marvel, because the Cedar hath a Gummy Moysture, which pre∣serves it from rotting; which Secret the <HI>Japanners</HI> not knowing, oftentimes look upon the Sudor or Sweating of their Cedar Images as a great Wonder: But this is occasion'd by the moist Air, and a South Wind, which generally draws an Oyl out of that Wood. Moreover this Tree grows higher and thicker, according to the several Places it is Planted in. On the Mountains of <HI>Syria</HI> they grow so large-wasted, that four Men are scarce able to fathom one of them; but these have spiny and slender Bodies, considering their wondrous Height, whose lofty Crowns seem to mingle with the Clouds. <HI>Japan</HI> also produ∣ces Cedars, no ways inferior to those: The Leaves thereof are soft and downy, but prickly at the sharp ends. There is also a small kind of Resemblance be∣tween the Cedar and the Juniper-Tree; but the Leaf of the last is longer and
<PB N="97" REF="62"/>smaller, and grows nothing near so high; and the Wood thereof, being cut asunder and us'd, is soon subject to rot: And also the Cedars are of a more fragrant smell, and bear a kind of Cod not unlike the Myrtle, which being open'd, hath four white Corns or Grains, like Rice, inclos'd in them; which when ripe, are of a deep yellow Colour; whereas the Juniper-berry is black, bitterish, and unpleasant to the Palate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gum of Cedars, of what Vertue and Use.</NOTE>The Gum which the Cedar produces, preserves the dead Corps from decay∣ing; and the Berries have three several tastes: for the innermost of them is of a sharp rellish, the outermost Shell sweet, and the Pulp it self between sweet and sowre. These Trees either have continually Fruits or Blossoms on them: So that whilst one Tree bears Blossoms or Green-fruit, the other Ripen. This Fruit being hot in Operation, helps all Coughs proceeding from cold De∣fluxions, the Cramp, opens obstructed Uritories; and the Oyl thereof, if the Body be annointed therewith, defends it from the biting of Venomous Crea∣tures. Furthermore, the Cedar always flourisheth, being constantly green; whose stately Branches run up in an exact Line, like the Trees themselves; but if the Branches grow too heavy for them, the Body of the Tree commonly bends, growing crooked under the Burthen: The Cod which incloses the Berries, when it begins to ripen, opens it self, and in time of Rain or Mists, drops off, leaving a round Stalk at the Boughs: This Stalk decays not till two Years after the dropping off of the Cod, which of it self requires a whole Year before it becomes ripe, and this happens chiefly in Winter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambassadors come to <HI>Meaco.</HI></NOTE>Along this Bank, shaded with Trees, verging the River, the <HI>Netherland</HI> Am∣bassadors going through a Town call'd <HI>Iondo,</HI> came to <HI>Meaco,</HI> where they were Receiv'd and Lodg'd in the House of a Wealthy Merchant.</P>

So the Regicides broke into the Pa∣lace; where finding the Emperors Mother and Daughter, they made up their bloody Breakfast by such Female Murders: but the Empress her self, conceal'd in a Cloyster of the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> being discover'd, in cold Blood, acting Rebellion to the heighth, as a Criminal, they beheaded.</P>
<P>Thus they destroy'd the whole Royal Family, onely preserving <HI>Cubo</HI> his younger Brother, because he had taken the Order of Priesthood; and that they might not suspect him hereafter, they ty'd him with a Sacerdotal Vow, and oblig'd him by the like Religious Promises; but he by this means making his Escape, he secretly convey'd himself to <HI>Vatadomo,</HI> Governor of <HI>Loca,</HI> who re∣ceiv'd him very courteously, and perswaded to his assistance <HI>Nubunanga,</HI> King of <HI>Boari;</HI> who joyning together, brought an Army of sixty thousand Men into the Field against the Emperors Murderers, who finding themselves not able to resist, they freely resign'd (some of the prime Abettors being punish'd) he in stead of putting in the next of Blood, made himself absolute Master of the City and Castle of <HI>Meaco,</HI> re-edifying the burnt Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Meaco</HI> taken; and the burut Palace re-built.</NOTE> which for the sudden perfecting he neither spar'd Cost nor Labor, employing fifteen thousand Men daily at Work; and going up and down with a drawn Scymiter, that none might be idle or lose any time, where he cut off a Carpenter's Head, for lifting up the Vail of a Woman, by chance then passing by.</P>
<P>At last <HI>Nubunanga</HI> went on so victoriously, that in short time he conquer'd and brought under his subjection thirty several Kingdoms; also making him∣self Master of <HI>Cubo,</HI> setting the Imperial Crown upon his Head, as a Trophy of his Victories: and afterwards put the same upon his new Idol in <HI>Dubo,</HI> which represented him to the life, that so he might, whilst living be worshipp'd as a god: to which end he wanted not store of Sycophant Courtiers, and other City Flatterers, that held him up in this his vanity, making him believe, That nothing could be more just and honorable for a Person that had perform'd such wondrous Acts, and made so many Conquests by his Prudence, sole Conduct, and Valor.</P>
<P>But others resented hainously this his vain Imagination, and proud Design; not but that several Princes they had themselves deifi'd for their worthy Acti∣ons after they were deceased, but that his ambition should aspire so high, to be both God and Man at once, and whilst he was yet living, and subject to all mortal frailties, he should blasphemiously presume to take place among the gods, and receive Offerings and Sacrifice, onely fit for Immortals, and the ever blest; unless (said they) we should make him a god for his Cruelty, his Promise-breaking and Perjury: for whatsoever Countreys were surrendred to him, trusting in the Honor of a Prince, his Oaths and Clemency, he put with∣out mercy to the Sword, as if he had taken them by Storm, and entred by violence. But more than any, King <HI>Aquechi,</HI> being a bold and high-spirited Prince, chaf'd and storm'd, and would not sit down tamely, and talk onely of this his prophane arrogance, though he had oblig'd him with many great favors and bounty, making him King of <HI>Tango,</HI> and General over his whole Army; yet in such a Point as this, the honor of Religion, and the true Wor∣ship of their ever just gods, at the stake: therefore converting the Emperors whole Forces against him, he march'd up to <HI>Meaco</HI> the two and twentieth of <HI>June, Anno</HI> 1582.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince <HI>Aquechi</HI> flays <HI>Nubunanga.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Nubunanga</HI> being thus suddenly surpris'd and beleaguer'd with his own Forces, had no way to attempt his Escape, but being follow'd close by

<P>In <HI>Japan,</HI> as also in all <HI>India,</HI> are no Mills to Grind any manner of Corn; wherefore they Bake no Bread after our <HI>European</HI> manner. Their Rice serves them in stead of Bread, but is boyl'd in Water, and brought to their Tables like Pap or Pudding. The Rice which is not kneaded but in Lumps, is very unwholsom, and occasions the griping in the Bowels, and weak Eyes. They also Roast their Rice after that it is boyl'd, making it in Cakes.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Xaverius</HI> relates, that travelling through <HI>Japan,</HI> he sustain'd himself a long time by those Cakes of Rice, which the <HI>Japanners</HI> call'd <HI>Arela,</HI> carrying some of them with him in his Sleeves.</P>

The last day, for to close up all, they make their Rehearsal of all the Sermons, being a Repetition of what they formerly deliver'd; which done, they drink off a chearing Bowl of lusty Liquor; then dres∣sing themselves up in their best Habits, stuffing their wide Sleeves with Stones, and hanging weights of Iron about their Necks, they enter the Boat, in which they lay a sharp Scythe, for to Mow off, as we said before, the Thorns and Briars which grow in the way to Bliss.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I saw</HI> (says <HI>Villela,</HI> in his foremention'd Letter) <HI>one that had seven Associates, which did all throw themselves into the Sea, with like joy, as at the Celebration of a Marriage, that I stood astonish'd with admiration.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Villela</HI> relates in his foremention'd Letter, That this Romance, or Hocus-Pocus of conveying bodies, is generally believ'd to be real amongst the <HI>Japan∣ners,</HI> but always lookt upon as a bad <HI>Omen:</HI> And in his time, he says, there dwelt one of the <HI>Bonzi</HI> in the City <HI>Sacci,</HI> who being very rich, liv'd as vicious a life, and being seventy years old, lying on his death-bed, could not endure to hear of death; but one day, at high noon, he was taken away on a sudden in the presence of all his friends, and was never heard of after.</P>

<P>This cruel Execution is oftentimes inflicted upon many without any cause; for they judge those liable to the same punishment that have any Re∣lation to the Criminal.</P>

He had a Brother a Servant to the King of <HI>Fingo,</HI> two hundred forty seven Leagues distant to the Westward from <HI>Jedo:</HI> an Unkle in <HI>Satsuma,</HI> twenty Miles farther: a Son by King <HI>Co∣nocoumy:</HI> a second Son, who dwelt Eastward from <HI>Jedo,</HI> one hundred and ten Leagues, serving the King of <HI>Massama:</HI> his third Son, in the Imperial Ca∣stle <HI>Inquano:</HI> his youngest Son being Marry'd to a wealthy Merchants Daugh∣ter in <HI>Osacca.</HI> Two of his Brothers being of the Emperors Life-Guard. All these were forc'd in one day and hour, for their Brother or Fathers foremen∣tion'd offence, in a miserable manner, to rip up their own Bowels.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of cutting their bellies.</NOTE>Which Executioners work is perform'd thus: First, they cast up how ma∣ny hours it may be ere the Messenger of Death brings the sad news to their re∣motest Relations; which being the utmost time, appointed no Reprieve be∣yond, both the nearest and farthest on one day, and just at noon, obeying the strict sentence, they become their own cruel destroyers.</P>
<P>But one of them, a Merchant in <HI>Osacco,</HI> prevented self-slaughter, being struck with so great a terror, that he dy'd immediately after the tidings; and his one∣ly Daughter, who would have made her self away, though not Condemned, had she not been carefully look'd after, starving her self, dy'd on the eleventh day: But how the Women escap'd in these destroyings of Families, he is si∣lent in.</P>
<P>¶ <HI>CAsper Villela</HI> in his Letter from <HI>Firando,</HI> dated the 13 of <HI>October</HI> 1557. says thus concerning this manner of punishment:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Those that are to be ript open have two choices left them, either to cut their bellies, or fight to death.</NOTE> <HI>When the King Condemns any to this Execution, he sends a Messenger to him, who acquaints him with the day on which he must die, the Condemned Person never flinches nor seeks to make an escape, but humbly requests that the King would be so pleas'd, that he himself might perform his Maje∣sties Command, which if granted, he takes for the greatest honor which at that time he is ca∣pable of. At the appointed hour, he attires himself in his best Rayment, and so rips up his
<PB N="114" REF="77"/>own Bowels; but if the King order his Death by the common Execution, then he puts him∣self in a posture of defence, guarding his House with his Children, Friends, and Servants; the King's Officers coming at the expected hour with a strong Party, begin the Assault and Battel, with discharging of Arrows; then drawing nearer, they come to pushing of Pikes, and chosing up with their Swords, entring, (the Kings Party being always too strong) cru∣elly massacres him and his whole Family: and the rest of his Relations that were not there, nor engag'd, are all stigmatiz'd with a hot Iron.</HI></P>
<P>This severe Law neither exempts the highest nor the lowest, but Lords and Peasants, Citizens and Soldiers, suffer thus without mercy all alike. This false Witnesses have, or any that are taken in a Lye before a Magistrate, inflicted upon them, insomuch that most Punishments amongst the <HI>Japanners</HI> are san∣guinary.

<P>These, though Kings, have no Princely Fare, onely a little Rice, Roots of Trees, wild Herbs, and some other unsavory Food, which they cook them∣selves: and that which adds more to their misery, is bad Drink, and unwhol∣som Water.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reasons of Earth∣quakes are adjug'd to be several.</NOTE>Also of the Cause of Earthquakes, the Variety and several Manners of its Aguish Fits, Writers differ much. <HI>Democritus</HI> tells us, <HI>That abundance of Rain soaking through the Crannies and Porous parts of the Earth, swelling its Belly like a Drop∣sie, rises and recoyls towards the Superficies, to disembogue it self; but wanting vent, beats, seeking a Passage against the upper Ground, which causes that Trepidation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thales</HI> held, <HI>That the Earth being a floating Ball, danc'd upon the then more troubled Waters, the cause of its Shaking.</HI> But the more Modern Opinion, which seems most likely, is, <HI>That these Shakings of the Earth arise from a Sulphureous and Nitrous Matter, which either by Fermentation, or some other Accident, taking Fire in the Bowels of the Earth, blows up like the springing of a Mine; which sudden Bounce in like manner shakes all Parts about it, and opens the way, that in a Train it explodes other like Combusti∣ble Matter: And after, as many times it happens, it makes Breaches, whence Flashes of Fire breaking forth, tear the Surface of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The right opinion of <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI> concerning Earth∣quakes.</NOTE>The most Learned agree, <HI>That these Tremblings rather arise from imprison'd Winds in the vast Caverns of the Earth, whose former Passages being stopp'd by accidental falls of Earth, and Internal Ruins, seek a Vent else-where: Or whether it be that the Winds descending nearer the Center, finding no way back; or whether the thirsty Earth, being in Nature dry, sucks up abundance of Moysture, which either by Subterranean Heat, or the piercing Warmth of the Sun-beams, are rarified into more stirring Vapors, which wanting room for its Activity, breaks through the very Adamantine Dungeons of the Earth; which violent Ruptures shake the Superficies, being also torn and rent in like manner.</HI></P>
<P>Thus holds <HI>Aristotle</HI> also, demonstrating the same with several Philosophical Arguments, saying, and proving by Experience, <HI>That the greatest Earthquakes happen always in serene and calm Weather, which falls out in</HI> September <HI>and</HI> March, <HI>when commonly the Air is most turbulent; these Meteors seeming to have left the middle Re∣gion of the Air, and got into the middle Bowels of the Earth.</HI> Which he makes more apparent, saying, <HI>That the Earthquakes never cease, till the Winds break forth through the erupted Earth again: And that those Countreys that have most Excrescencies, being more Mountainous, and nearest the Sea, are oftner troubled with this dire and sad Infliction; whereas the Champaign and Inland Countreys scarce ever hear of a Terrene Trepidation.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The differences of Earth∣quakes.</NOTE>Some Philosophers reckon up three sorts of Earthquakes; others seven. The first is, That the Earth tosseth like a Boat upon the Sea, which subvert∣ing, quite overthrows so many fair Buildings. The second seems like a Knock∣ing, or great strokes under the Ground, which makes the Superficies recoyl and fall, inclos'd Vapors then seeking a Passage. The third, a Ripping and Renting of the Earth into yawning Graves, in which are swallow'd up and buried oftentimes whole Cities. But he that Dedicated his Description of the
<PB N="128" REF="84"/>World to <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> reckons four more: The first is a double Trem∣bling, that meets and dashes Terrene Billows one against another: The se∣cond, a Breaking of the Ground in all parts: The third, onely a Rumbling under Ground: The fourth, shuffling the Earth in a wonderful manner, which turns all things topsie-turvey.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How long they continue.</NOTE>Concerning the continuance of Earthquakes, sad experience hath taught us, that some will last forty days together, without little or any intermission, ac∣cording to the easiness or difficulty of the vents which keeps in longer or short∣er the shut up Commotions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The signs before the Earth∣quakes.</NOTE>There are also several signs that are fore-runners of these miserable effects; for growing near (as we said before) the Air is generally very calm, because those Vapors that commonly disturb the Air, are confin'd in the close Bowels of the Earth; and if any Cloud appear, it seems like a thin stroke or white Line athwart the Sky, which happens commonly after Sun-set, and in fair Wea∣ther.</P>
<P>But the Sea is troubled, swelling very much without any apparent cause of molestation; and the Water that had been fresh in standing Lakes, grows Salt and Brackish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pliny H st. <HI>19.</HI></NOTE><HI>Pliny</HI> relates, That <HI>Pheraecides</HI> a <HI>Grecian</HI> Philosopher, after he had taken such Water out of a Pit, foretold the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> of the Destruction of their City, then threatned by an approaching Earthquake; Another sign is, that the <HI>Rep∣tilia,</HI> or all creeping Animals that live under ground, forsake their dark Recesses, and frighted, seek up and down for other abodes; The Sun, no Clouds ap∣pearing, grows dark, and shines pale and dim.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The events that follow on an Earthquake.</NOTE>The Earthquakes themselves amaze the beholders in such manner, that they often bereave men of their Senses; for who would not be astonish'd, and for ever after stupifi'd into folly or frenzy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stange inconveniencies in <HI>Japan,</HI> occasion'd by Earth∣quakes.</NOTE> to see Houses, Towns, Cities, nay whole Kingdoms turn'd into one Sepulchre? great and new Islands, thrown up in an instant in the Sea? Mountains remov'd, and seeming routed to run several ways; the sollid and firm Continent, turn'd into a crue of segregated Isles, and other Lands, the Sea quitting them, are joyn'd to the main Land? Fire, and Streams of burning Sulphur are vomited out of the Earth, and burning Coals, Ashes, and heaps of Rubbish spread over Sea and Land, for the space of many Miles; common Roads turn'd into Rivers; then the sickness and mortality that happens after, falling on-those that escape, from the dire infecti∣on of noysome Parbreaks belch'd from the Earth; of which dreadful Calami∣ties, no Nation suffer more than the <HI>Japanners.</HI></P>
<P>¶ ANd that we may have a better sence of the miserable condition of those that suffer in this worst of extremities, take a brief account from Eye∣witnesses of two that happen'd nearer our own doors; The first happen'd about 160 years ago at <HI>Bononien;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Horrible Earthquakes at <HI>Bononien.</HI></NOTE> the second in <HI>Ragusa,</HI> near <HI>Illiria. Philippus Ber∣naldus,</HI> a learned Person, liv'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1505. in <HI>Bononien,</HI> where on the last of <HI>Octo∣ber,</HI> about eleven a Clock at night, a horrible noise awaken'd him, and all the City; soon after, Chimneys and Walls tumbled to the ground, yet in few hours, it beginning to cease, they were a little comforted; but three days after about the same hour in the night, it broke forth with such violence, that the Inhabitants expected nothing but their utter ruine, hideously roaring, and thundering underneath, and rouling like a troubled Sea above the Earth; great and small Buildings falling with dreadful cracks into a heap of Ruines; dark∣ness
<PB N="129" REF="84"/>increasing, made the terror the greater. Half of Prince <HI>Bontivoly</HI>'s Palace fell with such force, tumbling down, added so to the Earthquake, that it shook the whole City. The Walls of St. <HI>Jaques,</HI> St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and St. <HI>Francis</HI> Churches were rent from the top to the bottom, the Steeples and Pinnacles, and other Towers coming all down headlong at one blow, not one Chimney in the whole City or Suburbs left standing, yet by degrees, after the great violence abated, eve∣ry night, some sudden trepidations gave them new alarms of fresh terror; therefore the Inhabitants forsaking their own houses, liv'd in Tents in the Corn Fields, at least a moneth after; most of whom fell into Burning-Feavers, of which many dy'd.</P>
<P>After the second Earthquake, began a third, which also beginning in the night, lasted forty days, doing great mischief, after the unvaluable damage they had suffer'd before.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Boroaldus</HI> relates, That his friend <HI>Falcus Argelatus</HI> was struck with such a Consternation, that loosing his Senses, in a desperate manner cut his own throat, who not performing speedily the work, he frantickly ran up a pair of Stairs, and threw himself headlong out of a Window, and broke his own neck, whereof he dy'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Earthquake at <HI>Ragousa:</HI></NOTE>Not long since, <HI>Ragousa</HI> was in like manner terribly shaken by an Earth∣quake. This Trepidation began on the sixth of <HI>April</HI> 1667. in the morning be∣tween eight and nine of the Clock, it being a clear and Sun-shiny day. In the twinkling of an eye, the whole City was shaken, the Legier <HI>George Crook,</HI> being sent by the States of the <HI>United Netherlands</HI> to take his Residence at <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI> had also a house at <HI>Ragousa,</HI> which tumbling down, kill'd him, his Wife, Minister, Child, and two Servant-Maids. <HI>Jacob Van Dam,</HI> who was President for the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> at <HI>Smirna,</HI> was in the same house, but in a lower Room. He with six others got under a Stone pair of Stairs; he was no sooner out of his Lodging, scarce half Cloth'd, but it tumbled down, with three Stories more, darkness struck them with fresh terror; after which, when growing clear, <HI>Van Dam</HI> came forth from his shelter, and went to <HI>Crook</HI>'s House, where calling as loud as he could, and hearkening if possible he could to hear any body answer him, he concluded that they lay all swallow'd under the Rubbish and Ruines. Neither durst he tarry long there, seeing the Walls totter, fear∣ing he might suffer under the like Calamity, never standing still, till he got quite out of the City; all the way terrifi'd with imminent danger, Stones and pieces of Timber still falling in a terrible manner, both before and behind him, the ground trembling under him, and gaping in several places about him, that hundreds of swallowing Gulfs appear'd in the Streets. Thus he, with six more of his Company, with much trouble and terror scap'd out of <HI>Rogousa,</HI> lo∣sing one by sudden death in the way; but when they had clear'd themselves of the Town, the Countrey prov'd no less difficult and dangerous, great heaps of torn up Rocks and Rubbish, filling the Paths, so that they being put to a stand, could find no way to get farther, whilst looking behind them, they saw the City in several parts of fire, and three Store-houses of Powder (a dreadful thing) when e're they catcht, would utterly destroy the miserable remainder of those yet alive.</P>
<P>Thus for a night and a day this misery lasted, without any intermission, whilst the people that escaped lay in the Fields, without either eating or drink∣ing; and few of these that thus escaped, but were either hurt or struck with sickness, and had not a <HI>Venetian</HI> Ship that lay in the Harbor afforded them
<PB N="130" REF="85"/>Bread, they had perish'd with hunger; which Vessel also ran as dangerous a Risk, for the water forsaking the Haven, left them three times on the bare Sand, and that often times failing, hideously gaping, was ready to swallow them up; then the Sea returning with such violence, that it was a wonder but they had been bilged upon the Shore, besides many others suffer'd that lay there, living in a most sad condition, under beams lighting across amongst the Piles, that were hurt and maim'd, languishing, starv'd to death, no possible help to remove the great heaps of Timber and get them out.</P>
<P><HI>Van Dam</HI> at last got aboard of a Ship, where the terror was a little mitigated, a Magazine of Powder being very near, expecting every minute the blowing up; when two days after, on the eight of <HI>April,</HI> three hundred <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moor-lacks</HI> on Horses and Mules, descending from the Mountains, after some small resistance, entred the City, there making havock and bloody slaughter where e're they went; so clearing the way with a great booty gather'd up amongst the Ruines, return'd.</P>
<P>On the sixth day, the Earthquake beginning to abate a little, <HI>Van Dam</HI> went towards the City, to look after his Goods, and several Presents which the Am∣bassador <HI>Crook</HI> had in custody for the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI></P>
<P>The City was yet in a miserable condition, the Earthquake still continu'd, though not so furiously as before, the Fire also not quench'd, and the Streets full of Theeves and Robbers; the Ways and Paths cover'd with dead bodies, of which some were Burn'd, others lying in their own Blood, which occasi∣on'd a horrible stench: Yet <HI>Van Dam</HI> found at last some Labourers, whom he employ'd to dig out his Goods from under the Rubbish, promising them one half for getting the other. Two days they spent in prosecution of the design, but nothing appearing, they were quite disanimated, and gave over; of six thousand House-keepers, remain'd scarce six hundred alive, sixteen thousand be∣ing Burnt and lost by the Subterranean Fires breaking forth.</P>

<P>At the upper end of the City, close by the River <HI>Toncaw,</HI> appears an exceeding large Watch-Tower, being Four-hundred fifty eight Foot and a half high, Guarded with twelve hundred Souldiers.</P>
<P>On the East side of this the Emperors Magazine, a large Structure; in the West, rang'd in order, stand several. Temples of their Idol <HI>Fotoques,</HI> one con∣secrated to <HI>Camis,</HI> and another to their Evil Natur'd god, which we call the Devil: In the middle of the City rises a most delightful Banqueting-House, in which the Emperor <HI>Chiongon Toxogunsama</HI> us'd to Recreate himself.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emperors Garden.</NOTE>Moreover, those that view the West part of <HI>Jedo,</HI> will first see the Palace of the King of <HI>Bungo,</HI> to which is joyn'd his Imperial Majesties Garden, which is so exceeding pleasant and delightful, that those famous Orchards of <HI>Semira∣mis</HI> being reckon'd amongst the Seven Wonders of the World, are much inferior to it; Nature and Art striving to out-vye one another.</P>
<P>Next to this, stands the Palaces of the Lords of <HI>Chiecow</HI> and <HI>Firando,</HI> His Im∣perial Majesties Councellors, <HI>Bungono, Nognicono, Vonemo, Ingando, Cambano, Ri∣mo, Cuno,</HI> and <HI>Texinucano:</HI> The <HI>Camies</HI> also Resides in a very sumptuous Build∣ing.</P>
<P>Somewhat farther is another fair House, in which <HI>Utrandono,</HI> the Emperors Groom-Porter dwells; Southward from thence is the Temple of <HI>Xaca;</HI> close by which stands the Custom-house; near this are several large Buildings for

<P>This City hath also several other fair Buildings, in that part which is be∣yond the Mountain <HI>Tocajamma,</HI> for there is a strong Garrison wherein are Quarter'd Three thousand five hundred Souldiers: On one side of which is the Palace of the Mayor, or Chief Governor of that part of the City, to whom all the Inferior Officers are to render an account weekly, of what hath happen'd in that time in their several Wards.</P>
<P>The Watch-Tower which is seen at a great distance, both by Sea and Land, and the Garrison, with the Chief Governors Court, make most ways a Trian∣gular Prospect; somewhat farther stands a Temple Dedicated to all sorts of Beasts, with a very high double Roof. On the North side of which appears a large Court, in which four of the prime <HI>Bonzies</HI> live together, having also three Temples built in a Row.</P>

<P>The King of <HI>Figens</HI> Court makes also a stately show: But on one side of the Empresses Palace are Houses, being large built, all of Stone, wherein lies the Inexhaustable Emperial Treasures, and heap'd-up Mountains of Gold, and Silver, not to be valued within the compass of Arithmetick; the Riches of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and the Golden Mines of <HI>Potosi,</HI> with the whole Revenues of all the <HI>European</HI> Kings cast up together, would scarce Ballance the unimaginable Audits, and vast Accompts thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Phaiglerodano Cammangon,</HI> the Empresses Brother, being the King of <HI>Jamay∣stero,</HI> dwells here also in a sumptuous Palace, near which are three Courts, be∣longing to his Unckles, the first being the King's of <HI>One way,</HI> the second of <HI>Mito,</HI> the third of <HI>Cinocuni,</HI> all three Brothers to the Emperor <HI>Xogunsama,</HI> surnam'd <HI>Conbosama;</HI> These three Palaces stand very near one another, the largest and fairest, is that in which <HI>Cinocuni</HI> Resides, having two Roofs one above another. <HI>Xogunsama,</HI> Son to the Emperor <HI>Daifusama</HI> succeeded his Father in his Throne, <HI>Anno</HI> 1616.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empress worships <HI>Amida.</HI></NOTE>¶ FAther <HI>Lodowick Frojus</HI> relates in his Letter from <HI>Canga,</HI> an Island in <HI>Japan,</HI> dated <HI>Anno</HI> 1565. <HI>That the Emperor</HI> Cuba <HI>his Royal Consort, had built a Chappel in her own Palace, Dedicating it to</HI> Amida, <HI>in which she daily attended with a great Train of Ladies, there paying her Devotions to his Statue representing a comely Youth, Crown'd with Gold, that Reflected Rayes, like Sun-Beams; for when the Emperor</HI> Cu∣bus <HI>was slain by the Rebels</HI> Diandono <HI>and</HI> Mioxindono, <HI>and the Empress making her escape took Sanctuary in a Monastery near</HI> Miaco, <HI>where being discover'd, the Priviledge of the place not protecting, they sent an Executioner to take away her life; she preparing to obey the hard Sentence, call'd for Pen, Ink, and Paper, and Wrighting to her two Daugh∣ters which were also Imprison'd in the next House; Informing them, That she was to be un∣justly Murder'd, but she rejoyc'd, and would be glad to Imbrace Death, because she doubt∣ed not, but that</HI> Amida <HI>had found this means to bring her to a better Habitation, and the sooner to enjoy that Paradise, where her Dear Husband, so lately Murder'd remains; ex∣pecting by her company the full accomplishment of both their Happiness. Then Sealing the Letter, she thank'd the</HI> Bonzi <HI>for his kind entertaining of her in their Colledge, and draw∣ing near to</HI> Amida's <HI>Altar, where kneeling, she lifted up her Hands, and call'd twice on the god for to forgive her her Sins: Then the</HI> Bonzi <HI>laid his Hand upon her Head, as a Token, that she had Absolution from all her Offences; then going from thence into a pri∣vate Room, she lifted up her hands again to Heaven, and cry'd,</HI> Amida, Amida, <HI>which said,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Was beheaded.</NOTE> <HI>she was Beheaded.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Images of <HI>Amida,</HI> are di∣vers.</NOTE>Furthermore, it is to be observed, that there are several Images Represen∣ting this god; for whereas he sometimes is made (as we said before) with a Dogs Head, riding on a Seven-Headed Horse, another resembling a Naked Youth, with Holes in his Ears, sitting on a large Rose, Carv'd of Wood, and in a strange Shape, with a Fantastick Cap on his Head, slit before, with two large Buttons on the top, with a comely and youthful Countenance; in his
<PB N="139" REF="95"/>Ears hang two Rings, one within another, about his Neck a Scarf, his Breast cover'd with an Oval Plate curiously Engraven, over his Shoulders and Back hangs a Coat of Feathers neatly Wrought, and joyn'd together, in his Hands a String of Beads, his Breast and Belly exceeding large, sitting on a great Cushion, before him stands several <HI>Japan</HI> Letters, Engraven on a square Stone.</P>
<P>They also place oftentimes near their god <HI>Amida,</HI> another Idol with thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heads, which are cover'd with one flat Cap, or Bonnet, joyn'd close together, their Chins Hairy, about the Neck a Pastboard Band, on each side four Arms and Hands, the Breast and Waste girded with five Strings of Pearl; the Belly appears like the Body of the Sun, darting Rays, with several Chara∣cters in the middle; the Walls are all hung with rich and costly <HI>Japan</HI> Habits, and before them many burning Lamps.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A very stately Temple with a thousand Images near <HI>Meaco.</HI></NOTE>But besides these two Temples of <HI>Amida</HI> in <HI>Jedo,</HI> there is a most famous Chappel about a League from <HI>Meaco,</HI> being of more antiquity, erected by some of their antient Emperors, and since by the Modern enlarg'd and beautifi'd, being four hundred and twenty Foot long, having two great Porches, with Portcullises in the middle: where entring you may first see a large Seat, on which sits an Image, bigger than the Life resembling a Giant, with Holes in his Ears, Bald-headed, and shaven after the manner of the <HI>Indian Brachmans;</HI> over this huge Figure hang several Cups, on both sides divers shapes of Armed Sol∣diers, <HI>Morisco</HI> Dancers, Exotick Wizards, and other dreadful Figures, with an∣tick Gestures: Their Wind and Thunder also are personated in terrible Figures. Then they enter the Chappel, ascending on seven Steps, having five hundred Idols on each side fix'd to the Wall, all representing <HI>Canon</HI> the Son of <HI>Amida,</HI> with amiable Looks, each having thirty Arms, two of which are of ordinary size, but all the other very small, and in every Hand two Arrows, on their Breasts are engraven seven little Faces, on their Heads Golden Crowns, with Strings of Diamonds. Moreover, not onely the Chains, Bells, and other things belonging to these Images, but also the Statues themselves are all Massie Gold, wrought by the Goldsmith, insomuch that the beholders Eyes dazle at the glory and splendor of <HI>Canon</HI>'s Chappel. To which most People from all Parts of <HI>Japan</HI> repair to perform their Devotions, and the rather, because there are many more Temples near it, to which they also resort upon the same ac∣count.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Temple for the <HI>Por∣cupine.</HI></NOTE>This Edifice is dedicated to the <HI>Porcupine,</HI> amongst them the Embleme of Learning; but they erect no Altar nor Image for him, as for other gods, but onely hang the dead Animal up in the Roof of the Hall, that when the Stu∣dents implore this Deity to fill them with Arts and Sciences, they may lift with their Eyes, their Hearts also to Heaven.</P>
<P>The third exceeds the other two in heighth and beauty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Palaces for Scholars.</NOTE>Here are other several Halls, adorn'd with large Image, which make up their University; where Scholars Study and have their Residence: in each of them are fair Libraries,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Library.</NOTE> stuft with innumerable Catalogues of Books, where with a Skrew, or turning of a Wheel, what Book soever they desire to see, presents it self.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Make bad use of them.</NOTE>But these Structures, built for religious intentions, and commonly in the most luxurious and pleasantest Situation of the whole Isle, are made by their dissolute and gormandizing Priests, the Academies of all Debaucheries, and especially the Schools of Gluttony, Drunkenness, and Lust; who in their Frol∣licks in open view of all their Idols, in a gallanting humor, will not spare to prostitute their wanton Mistresses; and for their more conveniency, lay them at the Feet of their gods, and make them Bolsters for their Adulteries.</P>
<P><HI>Hendrick Hagenaer</HI> relates, that he saw six Temples near <HI>Osacca,</HI> at whose Doors stood large Images of Wood, holding Boxes in their Hands, into which the <HI>Japanners</HI> throw Pieces of Copper, by them call'd <HI>Caxa.</HI></P>

of an incredible heighth, which so adorn the Temple, that they strangely amaze the beholders: The Accounts of the building this Edifice say, that each of these Pillars cost 5000 <HI>Ducats:</HI> The Walls Painted with various Images, and several Plants and Flowers, also much illustrate this House for their Divine Worship; the Roof is cover'd with Tyles made of Clay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And also strange Tyles.</NOTE> not temper'd or mix'd with Sand, but beaten very thin, each being two Inches thick, and have upon a Ground of black Paper several Shapes in antick postures, which are so curious, that they exceed one another in art and beauty:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An exceeding Roof.</NOTE> The vaulted Roof being Arch-wise, may last five hundred years without the lest Repair; and notwith∣standing it is very heavy and large, yet it jets nine Foot over beyond the Walls without Supporters, insomuch that our <HI>European</HI> Builders would think it impossible, that so great a weight could hang over in that nature without falling.</P>

<P>These Spirits are not permitted to Eat the least Blade of Corn, Herb, Grass, nor any thing whatsoever, but onely what they receive by Alms; to which purpose they throw Meat to Daws and Pies nine days together after their Friends departed Souls, that so the wandring of their deceased Relations may pick up something with them.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner how the wo∣men ourn themselves.</NOTE>¶ THe Funerals in <HI>India,</HI> if Married People, and the Husband die first, are commonly double; for the Women burn themselves with their Husbands, because they will not live after their deceas'd Lords; so perfecting the Celebrations of the Funerals: Which they willingly expose themselves to, in Honor of their God, whom they call <HI>Rama;</HI> which they perform thus.</P>
<P>When the Wife promises her departing Husband that she will die with him, then she must lose no time; but the same day, where her Husband lies burning in the Funeral Pyre, she must leap in, and be consum'd with him. This dread∣ful Ceremony is strictly observ'd by the <HI>Brachmans</HI> and <HI>Wiensjaes:</HI> But the <HI>Set∣teraes</HI> and <HI>Soudraes</HI> go farther; for there the Women also burn themselves, though their Husbands die in other Countreys, although it be many Years af∣ter their Deaths, yet as soon as they receive the sad News, they shrink not from the Fiery Trial of their Affections, but by burning dispatch themselves. Some of the Men also are as mad, who in the Worship of their <HI>Xaca,</HI> dig a large Pit without the City, in which making a great Fire, they desparately leap thereinto, where they are in short time consum'd to Ashes; whilst the Woman sits on a Stool, dress'd up, and richly clad, before the Door of their House; and if she be extracted from the <HI>Settera,</HI> or <HI>Soudra,</HI> she hath in one Hand a Lim∣mon, and in the other a Looking-glass, calling continually on the Name of their God, <HI>Naraina,</HI> or <HI>Rama,</HI> which is <HI>Xaca;</HI> sometimes chewing <HI>Betel,</HI> amongst which they mix an intoxicating Herb, that bereaves her of her Sen∣ses; so taking away all manner of fear of what she is to suffer.</P>
<P>But if she belongs to the <HI>Brachmans,</HI> or <HI>Wiensjaes,</HI> then they hold red Flowers in their Hands, first dedicated to the Idol, whose Picture they hang about their Necks: Then after she hath taken her Farewel of her Friends, she either goeth out of the City, or is carried in a Sedan, her Countenance being chearful, looking merrily, which she denotes by several Gesticulations of her Hands and Body, crying aloud to the Sound of Trumpets and Drums, <HI>Rema, Rama, Saltae; Rama, Rama, Saltae;</HI> that is, <HI>God Rama, Rama, make me happy.</HI> And thus being led through the chief Streets of the City by some of her nearest Friends, and at last approaching near the Place of Execution, where her Husband was burnt, she withdraws to a neighboring Pool; where after having wash'd her self, she puts on a yellow Garment, and gives her richest Apparel and precious Jewels to her chiefest Relations, and to the <HI>Brachman</HI>-Priest, which makes her Funeral-Sermon, before the Fire, to whom she also makes great Presents: The Pit wherein she is to leap, is like an Oven full of glowing Coals, being hung round about with green Mats, to the end she might not be affrighted at such a horrid Face of Death. At one end thereof lies a Mount, or Heap of Earth, thrown out of a small Hill, on which she takes her last Farewel of her Friends; All which, to perpetrate this dreadful Self-murder, encourage
<PB N="146" REF="99"/>her to be her own Destroyer; whilst she having thrown her beloved Pestle and Mortar, and other Housholdstuff which she us'd daily, into the Fire, they put a Jar of Oyl upon her Head, letting some fall upon her Body. The Mats being remov'd, the <HI>Virago</HI> leaps in; and after her, her nearest Relations stand∣ing round about, contribute to the Flames, each throwing in a Fagot, the soon∣er to dispatch their wretched Kinswoman.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference in burning wo∣men.</NOTE>Thus the Widows end their Lives, that are of the <HI>Settrean, Weinjaen,</HI> or <HI>Sou∣draen</HI> Families: But the <HI>Brachman</HI> Women suffer a more cruel Death; for they are laid close by their Husbands, on the Funeral-Pyre; then the People build a Pile of Wood over them, placing about their Heads Oyl, Rozin, and Turpen∣tine: This done, the Women standing in order round about, make doleful <HI>Ullula's,</HI> mix'd with loud Shrieks and Lamentations; during which Clamor, the <HI>Brachman</HI>-Priest lights the Pile, which kindling by degrees, brings a linger∣ing and terrible Death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Women buried alive.</NOTE>Besides this way of ridding themselves of the old Females, they have ano∣ther way of destroying themselves, which they perform thus: They take the Relict, and lead her as it were in Triumph, amongst the Sound of Pipes, Drums, and Trumpets, to a Pit digg'd square like a Cellar, where stands the Body of her departed Husband; to which descending on Earthen Steps, set∣ting her self down on a Bank, she takes the dead Body in her Arms, then per∣fuming the Corps with Frankincense and Myrrhe; which done, the Mourners begin to throw the Mold into the Pit, which she rakes greedily towards her with her Hands, and so having cover'd her self at last with Earth to the Chin; then hanging a Cloth before the Entry of the Pit, they give her Poyson in a little Dish, and then on a sudden break her Neck backwards.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Die of Hunger for the Honor of <HI>Xaca.</HI></NOTE>Thus also the <HI>Japanners,</HI> both Men and Women, make away themselves, frantick with mad Zeal, in Honor to their God <HI>Xaca:</HI> For those that are his greatest Admirers, upon no other account than honoring him, dig their own Graves, covering the tops, leaving onely a small breathing-hole; wherein they famish themselves to death.

The Walls are built of Freeze-stone, very high and thick, with Battlements on the tops: The outermost Wall is surrounded with a broad and dry Trench, and over the same a Bridge, with several Arches: The Gate made strong with thick driven Iron Nails, is built four-square, two Stories high; each Square or Story having a peculiar Roof, jetting several Foot over the Walls; on each side of the upper Square hang two long Flags or Pennons, with the Emperors Arms: The Gate is continually Guarded by a strong Watch. Round about the inside of the Out-wall are an innume∣rable company of little Hovels, for the Soldiers: These Huts are built exactly in a Line, and border a second Moat, which is not without several Creeks, because the second Wall juts out in many Places, being a Bulwark, with many Towers, in all which are strong Guards kept, as on the Out-wall. In the second Gate is also a great Watch kept, to which joyns a third Trench,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hath three Moats and Walls.</NOTE> over which leads a fair Stone Bridge, at the end whereof a third Gate opens, between another Stone Wall, very sumptuously built.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Wall of the Pa∣lace.</NOTE>This is not a plain straight Wall, but rather a Bulwark; with Redoubts and Out-works, and several Flankers, Towers, and Watch-houses; yet uni∣form, answering one another: So that it rather seems a Fortification, than a Wall. When you are past the third Gate, you enter into a spacious Quadran∣gle, where before you, but as far as you can discern, appears the Emperors Banquetting-house, with stately Turrets, surrounded with Trees and strong Walls: On the Left-hand it is indented; but on the Right, smooth and even, running along a Hill, on which the Emperor's Temple stands. Nearer the third Gate are several lesser Courts: The first being square, hath many fair Lodgings about the same, supported on twenty eight Cedar Columns, being open underneath like <HI>Piazza's;</HI> over which Rooms a Roof shoots out sloap∣ing, and hath a second Story on the top, Wall'd round about, over whose four Corners jets another Roof.

Between this first Palace, and the third Inner-wall, are daily drawn up the Emperor's Guard, being three thousand Men, which keep constant Watch there. Next to this first Palace joyns a second, which exceeds the other in length, but is nothing near so high; the Roof also adorn'd with Golden Balls.

<P>These Worshippers of so opposite a Religion, one Adoring the Rat, the other the Crocodile, are not onely at variance among themselves, which often grows to War, but they prosecute and destroy the Creatures where ever they find them; the Crocodilians destroy all the Rats and <HI>Ingnumons</HI> where ever they find them; and those that put their trust in Rats, destroy without mercy all Crocodiles.</P>

<P>By this ignorance of the Heathens, appears plainly Gods Wrath and Di∣vine Judgements, men Adoring in the presence of a Never-dying and Om∣nipotent God, that which is not onely Mortal and Frail, but much Inferior to themselves: But who can give us a better account, and the reason of Wor∣shipping of Beasts, than the never-failing School-master of the <HI>Heathens?</HI> I will here set down the whole words written in the first Epistle to the <HI>Romans;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. v. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.</NOTE> <HI>Be∣cause that which may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God hath shew'd it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse. Because that when they knew God, they glorifi'd him not as God, nei∣ther were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was dark∣ned. Professing themselves to be wise, they became Fools: and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed Beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to unleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipp'd and serv'd the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.

The Besieged, though few in number, yet wanted all manner of Necessaries, without which they were not able to subsist a Day, and being driven to the worst of Exigencies, they made a Vertue of Necessity, and Sally'd out with three hundred and fifty Men, which Fought so valiantly, that with small resistance they beat their Enemies from their Works: But the Enemy was not so baffled, but drew up one Company for a Field-Battel, having two hundred and fifty Elephants in the Front, with
<PB N="158" REF="107"/>Wooden Towers, Planted with Cannon on their Backs, their Noses, or Snouts, Arm'd with sharp Scythes, which whisking to and fro, they could Mow down all those which came near them; behind these follow'd the <HI>Cingalessers,</HI> being the Foot well Arm'd, the right and left Flank Wing'd each with an hun∣dred and fifty Horse: At first sight the <HI>Portuguese</HI> were struck with a general consternation, and even ready to quit the Field, when one of the Enemies Ele∣phants being wounded, retreated disorderly, routing those that were next him, so opening a Breach, at which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> falling in like a Torrent, suddenly dissipated their whole Army, and making great slaughters, became Master of the Fieldl; and at last the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> recruited with fresh Supplies, took the City <HI>Ceylon,</HI> destroying all with the Sword and Fire, <HI>Anno</HI> 1654.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pico de Adam.</NOTE>¶ ON this Island is one of the highest Mountains in <HI>India,</HI> call'd <HI>Pico de Adam,</HI> or <HI>Adams Hill;</HI> for the <HI>Congaleans</HI> affirm, that <HI>Adam</HI> was Created there, the print of whose footsteps hewn in Stone, as they say, are to be seen yet.</P>
<P>On the top of this Mountain stands a magnificent Temple, held then to be full of Treasure and other Rarities of an inestimable value, the hope of which Booty drew the lucrative <HI>Portuguese</HI> thither, but found nothing according to the report, or their expectation, onely a Golden Cabinet, inchased with Pre∣cious Stones and Diamonds, in which lay inclos'd an Apes Tooth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Apes Tooth valued at seventy thousand <HI>Ducats</HI></NOTE>In what esteem or adoration the <HI>Ceylondians</HI> had this Relick, may appear by the trouble, charges, and proffers, which, they made for the redemption thereof; for they in solemn manner sent Ambassadors of special Quality, who made Address to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> tendring seventy thousand <HI>Ducats</HI> to be re-possess'd of the same.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> would fain have been nibling, and at sharing of so vast a Sum for so pitiful a trifle: But <HI>Gaster</HI> the Bishop utterly withstood it, affirm∣ing, that nothing could be more impious or contradictory to the true Belie∣vers of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> than to uphold by any means, directly or indi∣rectly, any thing whatsoever belong'd to the maintenance of false Worship and Superstition of the Heathen, and therefore order'd the Tooth to be burnt, and the Ashes to be thrown into the Sea.</P>
<P>But besides the <HI>Congaleans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo Geog. <HI>1.17.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Hemopolitans</HI> also (according to <HI>Strabo</HI>) wor∣ship an Ape.</P>
<P>¶ IT deserves no small admiration, that the <HI>Japanners,</HI> and other <HI>Heathens</HI> stoop to such vile Creatures, and worship them as their God, being themselves Men, and Aspirers to greater excellencies: Yet we may find, that the Antients, upon seeming good Reasons, held several Beasts, and despicable Creatures in such great adoration, having by long practice made observation, by their Looks and Postures foretelling future Presages, and present Discove∣ries, which have oftner hit than otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI> affirming this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cicero <HI>1.2.</HI> de Nat. Deor.</NOTE> saith thus: <HI>The</HI> Egyptians <HI>are falsly aspersed concerning the worshipping of Creatures, for they adore none but upon good accounts, and some benefit or other which they receive from them: as in the first place the Bird</HI> Ibis, <HI>a great destroyer of Venomous Serpents. I could also say something on the nature of the</HI> Indian <HI>Mice, Croco∣diles, and Cats, but that I am not willing to enlarge this Discourse, yet I will conclude, that the</HI> Heathens <HI>worship their Beasts for benefits which they receive from them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lucan</HI> also tells us, That the <HI>Egyptians</HI> had found out more than the <HI>Moretani∣ans</HI> had done heretofore; for they divided the Heavens with the Stars into
<PB N="159" REF="107"/>twelve Houses, in which Signs are several Constellations, look'd upon by their Learning, or help of Imagination, to personate, as fix'd there, several sorts of Creatures, as Gods, Hero's, Men, Monsters, and several sorts of Fishes. And therefore the <HI>Egyptians</HI> have divers Worships, for their Soothsayers us'd not onely the Planets, which are as their gods, but make their Responses from the Configuration of the several Signs, which are inferior Creatures. First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucianus de Astrol.</NOTE> they worship a Ram which they have from <HI>Aries:</HI> they touch no Fish which resem∣bles the Sign <HI>Pisces;</HI> neither will they kill a Goat, because of <HI>Capricorn;</HI> and the Bull, for the sake of <HI>Taurus,</HI> they hold in the like estimation. The Apes re∣quiring a peculiar Worship, the Inhabitants Consecrated a peculiar Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>Lucan</HI> saith, That the <HI>Lybians</HI> worshipp'd the famous <HI>Jupiter Ammon,</HI> in the manner of a Ram, as being one of the twelve Celestial Signs, to whom the <HI>Heathens</HI> came from all Parts to know future Events.</P>
<P>Moreover, he saith some of these Worshippers of Beasts did not adore them as gods, but because they were Consecrated to their Deities, and for their good Deeds shewn either to the gods or men; and therefore at <HI>Delphis,</HI> according to <HI>Aelianus,</HI> a Wolf was religiously honor'd, because he gave direction of the sa∣cred stoln Gold, buried in the Mountain <HI>Parnassus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ambraciots</HI> worshipp'd a Lyonness, after the Tyrant <HI>Phayllus</HI> was de∣vour'd by one big with Young.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> tells us, That the Citizens of <HI>Troas</HI> worshipp'd the Mice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. Rhetor. L. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> because they gnaw'd their Enemies Bow-strings when they were at War with them.</P>
<P>Moreover, some of the Heathens, and also the <HI>Japanners</HI> believ'd, That the Souls of Men by death were transmigrated into Beasts, and therefore they wor∣ship not the Beast it self, but the Souls of Men which resided in them.</P>
<P><HI>Apollonius Tyancus</HI> perswaded the <HI>Alexandrians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philostr. in Vit. Apollon.</NOTE> That a tame Lyon which he had was the <HI>Egyptian</HI> King <HI>Amasis;</HI> for which reason the Priests made Offerings to this suppos'd <HI>Amasis,</HI> adorning the Beast with Golden Armlets, and Collars, and in that manner sent him to the farthermost Parts in <HI>Egypt,</HI> Singing before him religious Hymns and Praises of their god. In <HI>Leontopolis</HI> they erected a stately Temple, because <HI>Apollonius</HI> said, That it was not fitting that the powerful King <HI>Amasis,</HI> whose Soul was transmigrated into a Lyon, should go a begging from Door to Door for his Food.</P>
<P>But chiefly the Apes seem to afford the best Residences for humane Souls, because they resemble a Man both in outward Shape, and within,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humane Bodies.</NOTE> as <HI>Aristotle</HI> affirms: wherefore Physicians, when they want humane Bodies, often Anato∣mize an Ape.</P>
<P><HI>Galen</HI> calls an Ape an imperfect resemblance of a Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. L. <HI>2.</HI> Hist. Anim. Coel. Resp. L. <HI>3.</HI> C. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE> as <HI>Coelius Rodignius</HI> relates of him.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Japan</HI> Races.</NOTE>¶ BEfore this Palace of <HI>Taycosama,</HI> they have a piece of Ground taken in for a Course, or Race, being a Match betwixt a Man and a Horse; about the Walls stand thousands of Spectators, on a more eminent Seat, Rail'd in, sit cross Legg'd by themselves, several Drummers; on the tops of the Rails hang ready fitted to their hands great Copper Kettles and Basons; some also lying on the ground, on which they Beat and Taber with such force, that the hide∣ous din and shrilness of the noise, often deafs the unwilling hearers: At the end of this Lane stand two strong Posts, having a great Rope made fast from one to the other; behind this, at a small distance, stands a square Pillar, on which a Flag or Ensign waves, fast on a Staff; one mans Office is to imbrace this Post with his left hand, and with his right points on the Breast of another, who hath on his Breast hanging about his Neck a square Board, Painted with a Griffin; he also lays his right hand on the top of the Post, and his left on his Scymiter; next to him stands a third, side-ways, which holds a long knotted Whip in his right hand, which gives the Signal to the Racers; behind these three stand others with black Head-Pieces, adorn'd also with a Sable Plume, which are the Judges of the Course:The Prize which they run for is common∣ly two pair of Wax'd Boots, made fast to Woodden Clogs, Plated with Silver;

<P>¶ BUt as to what concerns the <HI>Dayro,</HI> he is the onely, true, and lawful Heir of <HI>Japan,</HI> and was formerly held in such Veneration by the <HI>Japanners,</HI> that they honor'd him as a god; and by this his great respect, he kept the Empire a long time in Peace and Quietness, till <HI>Anno</HI> 1550. During the <HI>Dayro's</HI> Govern∣ment, <HI>Japan</HI> never tasted the inconveniencies of a Civil War, which after his removal from the Throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil Wars were terrible in <HI>Japan,</HI> the reasons there∣of.</NOTE> brake out in that nature, that scarce any Coun∣trey in the World was ever a greater Stage or Blood-shed: The salvage cru∣elties which they us'd against one another, in that grand Commotion are un∣expressable; the Conquerors turn'd their new-gotten Provinces top-si-turvey, killing, not sparing Infants in the Cradle, destroying and burning both Towns and Villages, of which some to this day lie bury'd in their own Rubbish, by which they sufficiently testifie the Destructions which were made by their Ci∣vil Wars, in which <HI>Japan</HI> was turmoil'd above fifty years.</P>
<P>The occasion and beginning was thus; The <HI>Dayro,</HI> who is accounted so ho∣ly, that the Sun must not shine upon him, nor his Feet touch the Earth, nor his Hair or Nails ever suffer'd to be cut; (which Custom hath been in use from many Ages to this day) had a hundred and eighteen years ago two Sons, of which the second, according to an antient Law, supply'd the place of Cap∣tain-General, to be ready on all occasions to quell all manner of Insurrecti∣ons, either by substitute Kings or Subjects. The eldest expected after his Fa∣thers Decease, to possess the Throne, during whose life he held no Command. Their Mother, out of her affections to both, prevail'd so far with the <HI>Dayro,</HI> that the General-ship should be so divided betwixt both the Brothers, that they might Command their Forces Alternately, each his Trienial. But the youngest, when the time came that he should Resign his Commission to his eldest Brother, refus'd, and privately chose several Princes of <HI>Japan</HI> for to assist him if need should require; by which means he Fortifi'd himself so strongly, that he car'd for no Forces whatsoever, no, not his Father himself, who im∣mediately chose another General, granting him Commission, not onely to subdue, but kill his Rebellious Son.</P>
<P>Soon after, several of his Substitute Kings raising all their Forces, brought a mighty Army together in the Field, with which they went on so successfully, that in short time, they utterly defeated and destroy'd the Rebel, and all his Forces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrection against the <HI>Dayro.</HI></NOTE>This was the first Rebellion and Insurrection that was made against the <HI>Dayro;</HI> but by the death of his Son, the War was no way finish'd: For the con∣quering

<P>Against him the young <HI>Dayro</HI> arose, notwithstanding the new Emperor al∣low'd him all his former Revenues, and shew'd him the same Respect as had formerly been shown to his Father. At last the <HI>Dayro</HI> march'd towards the new Emperor, whom by means of a chosen General (by the <HI>Japanners</HI> call'd <HI>Cubo</HI>) he defeated and slew.</P>
<P>This Conquering General, not regarding the miserable end of the new-slain Emperor, aim'd also at the Crown, making himself absolute Master of all the Forces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inland Wars in <HI>Ja∣pan</HI> are very cruel.</NOTE>From hence proceeded a bloody War, Kings and Princes dividing the Countrey, appropriating Territories and Provinces to themselves; which was not done without much trouble: for by this means, not onely Countrey against Countrey, and City against City, but also petty Villages had peculiar Wars one with another; those which were Conquer'd, were sure not to find the least mercy: for they neither spar'd Houses nor Temples, nor indeed poor Infants, consuming and destroying all by Sword and Fire, so that in short time whole Cities lay bury'd in Ashes.</P>

And to that purpose, that he might the better bereave the Emperor of his Life privately and without distur∣bance, he invited him to a Banquet in the Cloyster of the <HI>Bonzi</HI> near <HI>Meaco,</HI> where he intended to put in Execution his bloody Design. But the Emperor <HI>Cubo</HI> scenting the business, suspected it the more, because he had information that the Army was drawn up near <HI>Meaco,</HI> made all things in readiness for his escape, who being on the Way was perswaded and call'd back by some of his Council, telling him that they could not perceive any such danger in the busi∣ness, accounting it ignoble for an Emperor to flye from a Prince which was his own Subject.</P>
<P>But in the interim <HI>Mioxindono</HI> entred the City <HI>Meaco</HI> with all his Forces, and drew up towards the Palace, but before he committed any hostility, he sent to the Emperor <HI>Cubo,</HI> demanding to send him the Heads of some of his No∣bles, whose insupportable Greatness (as he pretended) stood in his way; which if the Emperor would grant, a Peace should immediately be concluded, and he would suddenly withdraw his Forces, and depart from the City. The Herald brought a Letter, in which was written the Names of those Grandees which <HI>Mioxindono</HI> would have Executed: An antient Courtier being sent from <HI>Cubo</HI> receiv'd the Paper, which not without many reproaches to the Rebels he tore to pieces; and returning again to the Emperors Presence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">One of the Emperors Courtiers stab, himself.</NOTE> drew out a Stilletto, with which he desperately Stabbing himself, fell dead on the Ground at the Emperor's Feet.</P>

<P>But most remarkable was the behaviour of a tender Youth, scarce to be call'd a Man, who astonish'd the Foe with his desperate fierceness, having wounded several, and slain many of them, made his way to the Emperor's Corps; which looking upon with great grief and anxiety of spirit, vented his Passion thus: <HI>Why should I live, my Master thus Murder'd by accursed Traitors? I have done what I could for my Honor, his dear Love, and my Allegiance:</HI> Which as soon as said, he threw away his Sword, and with a Dagger cut his own Throat; notwithstanding which Wound, though mortal, to dispatch himself the sooner, he stabb'd himself to the Heart.</P>

<P>These Murmurings and Mutterings at last broke forth into open Flames, and Civil War, the Emperor Mustering all the Forces he could possibly get to∣gether against <HI>Nobunanga,</HI> with which he thought to make a sudden end of the business, and the better because <HI>Nobtmanga</HI> was gone to the Kingdom of <HI>Boari:</HI> But he hearing of the Emperor's great Preparations, rais'd also (scarce to be believ'd) another as vast an Army; with which he March'd directly to <HI>Meaco:</HI> and though he sent Messengers daily, with all humility imploring and pro∣posing Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobunanga</HI> destroys all.</NOTE> offering Articles of Agreement, yet destroy'd the Imperial Ter∣ritories with Fire and Sword where-ever he came; so that in a short time a hundred Villages, and several Cities, lay waste, being bury'd in their Ashes.

<P>¶ THe Mountain <HI>Frenoiama</HI> having very high Precipices, lies two Leagues Eastward from <HI>Meaco,</HI> eight hundred years since a <HI>Japan</HI> King built here three thousand eight hundred Temples, and by every one a Cloyster for the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> and that they might there without any molestation follow their Devotion and Study, he remov'd all the Rustick Inhabitants from thence with their Cattel, lest any noise should disturb them in their Retirements. At the Foot of this Mountain <HI>Frenoiama</HI> he built two Villages, calling them <HI>Upper</HI> and <HI>Lower Sacomotum,</HI> from whence the <HI>Bonzi</HI> fetch daily their Provisions:They had also a third Part of the Revenue of the Kingdom of <HI>Vomis</HI> allow'd them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Temple and Cloysters.</NOTE> These Edifices from time to time grew more and more in splendor and magnificence, because that continually some of the Emperor's Relations, or at least a King's Son, was kept there, which made it so famous, that all Matters of consequence were decided by these Monks, and all Disputations concerning their Religion were held in this University, and there, as in the chief Academy, all Scholars Commence.</P>
<P>But in process of time, and chiefly by the Wars, this vast number of Tem∣ples which stood on the top of <HI>Frenoiama,</HI> were reduced to eight hundred; and also the wanton and luxurious lives of the <HI>Bonzies,</HI> being given over to all De∣baucheries, made them break out into all manner of outrages, and dissolute courses, oftentimes throwing away their Books, taking up Arms: and whilst they grew formidable to maintain a War, they made the High-ways, and all Places dangerous by their several Murders and Robberies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bonzi</HI> become villa∣ous Murderers.</NOTE> nay, they grew so impudent at last, that without the least regard to the <HI>Dayro,</HI> by the <HI>Japanners</HI> honor'd as a god,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commit great outrages ic <HI>Meaco.</HI></NOTE> they set upon, and Storm'd <HI>Meaco,</HI> in the Year 1535. burning the whole City to Ashes; and not onely slew all those which escap'd the Fire, but tender Infants in the Cradle.</P>
<P>This barbarous piece of Cruelty remain'd unpunish'd a long time; until thirty six years after they receiv'd a. sufficient reward for their bloody inhuma∣nities: A great War arising between <HI>Nobunanga</HI> and the King of <HI>Nechier,</HI> the <HI>Bonzies</HI> furnish'd the <HI>Nechiers</HI> with all manner of Provisions and other Necessa∣ries, and blockt up the Passage and Avenues against <HI>Nobunanga:</HI> which he ta∣king very hainously, resolv'd to be reveng'd to the full: and accordingly to put his Design in execution, he return'd to <HI>Boari,</HI> which he Commanded as being King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobunanga</HI> crucifies the <HI>Bonzi.</HI></NOTE> and there drove all the <HI>Bonzies</HI> out of their several Abodes, Nailing all he could find on Crosses.</P>

they endeavor'd to perswade him, by telling him of the Sanctity of the Place, and Reverence which was to be shown to the gods, whose Temples and Altars stood upon <HI>Frenoiama,</HI> which had been kept unviolated many Ages. But <HI>Nobu∣nanga</HI> told them, that he scorn'd their proffer'd Money; neither fear'd he those gods they worshipp'd, that had committed so many inhumane and horrid im∣pieties, but by the help of better Powers would deal with them according to their merits.

<P>Soon after this, <HI>Toquixiro</HI> began to have a more elevated opinion of himself, and his swelling Thoughts aiming at something higher, he travel'd big with hopes to <HI>Meaco,</HI> where at first he got into the Service of a great Merchant, and soon after he was preferr'd to a Noble-man, a Prime Favorite of the Emperor <HI>Nobunanga's;</HI> who one day happening to go with the Emperor a Hawking, and <HI>Toquixiro</HI> being amongst the Faulconers, and others of the Court-Retinue, it chanc'd that one of the best Hawks, flying at his Game, hung tangled about the Bough of a high Tree, by the Vervils; and when none of them were able to climb the Tree, <HI>Toquixiro's</HI> Master bid him see what he could do, which he perform'd so well, and with such comely agility, and taking dexterity, that the like having not been seen before, the Emperor and all his Train admir'd the Man that so much out-did all the rest, especially <HI>Nobunanga</HI> himself; so that he took him into his Service, and preferring from place to place, he came to great Dignity; insomuch that the rest of the Courtiers that saw him rise before them, and grow more and more in the Emperors favor, spited him extremely, their former Love turning into hatred, and never rested contriving Plots, not onely to bring him down in his Pride and Greatness, but utterly to ruine him: When an Accident hapned pat for their purpose, which they were not negligent to lay hold on; and thus it was. A very rich Scymiter, pla∣ted with Gold, which the Emperor highly esteem'd, being stoln from the Court, and much inquiry after, his Enemies insinuating, whisper'd, that no body could steal it but <HI>Toquixiro,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is accus'd with Theft.</NOTE> having, as they said, often prais'd, and taken more than common notice of it: This buzz'd about, his Greatness ha∣ving left him few Friends to shake off the Aspersion, it was the general Talk, and most of them being willing, believ'd; when an Intimate of his advis'd him to fly; for when once it came to the Emperors Ear, there was no way to avoid an ignominious Death. He being of a quick Apprehension, took his Friends Advice, and absented; but he was no sooner miss'd, than his Enemies taking hold of the Advantage, made the Business no more doubtful, but all were satisfied, that he, and no other, was the Thief; the Emperor sending every where to apprehend him, that he might receive condign Punishment for his so hainous Offence. Whilst he thus absconded, in a miserable condition, fearing every minute to be taken, and so die without mercy, he secretly went up and down amongst the Goldsmiths, inquiring cunningly after such Plates as those that were on the lost Scymiter, as if he would buy such Golden Plates: So by great accident he lighted upon them: Then with a kind of Authority, being a Courtier, he question'd and threatned the Buyer; who frighted, to save his own Life, found the Seller, and so from hand to hand, at last the Thief himself;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manifests innocence.</NOTE> whom bringing to the Court, he was clearly acquitted of all, and had the honor to be Executioner himself;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuts off the Thieves Head.</NOTE> so cutting off the Malefactors Head, laid it with the recover'd Plates at the Emperors Feet, who straight re∣ceiving him into former Favor, still advanc'd him the more, vexing those by that means that had so falsly accus'd him.</P>

<P>¶ THe Impregnable Castle which held out against <HI>Nobunanga</HI> and all his Power, long after he was chosen Emperor, still sallying out with strong and bold Parties, fetching in Booty, and often doing much damage and mischief round about in several Places, now suppos'd altogether impossible to be taken in; <HI>Nobunanga</HI> considering the Activity and Subtlity of this his Fa∣vorite, he thought once more to Attaque it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leads an Army into the Field.</NOTE> So making <HI>Toquixiro</HI> General of the Forces appointed for that purpose, and Commissioning him at large, set him upon the Work, though with small hopes of carrying so considerable a Business: But beyond his expectation, and all others that scoff'd at it, as a ri∣diculous Undertaking, he behav'd himself so well, and shew'd himself so great a Master of Arms, that without much ado, what had remain'd a Goad so long in the Emperors side, and had baffl'd him so oft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes the Castle of <HI>Nan∣gafama.</HI></NOTE> he took in.</P>

Thus being one of <HI>Nobunanga</HI>'s Chief Lieutenants, after his Defeat at <HI>Meaco,</HI> being slain in the <HI>Imperial-Blood-Grove,</HI> he took upon him the Authority of Protector of his third Son, an Infant of three Years old, whom he kept in a Castle, shewing him all possible Reverence, due to so hope∣ful and great a Prince: For <HI>Nobunanga</HI>'s eldest Son was slain with his Father, and the second ran distracted.</P>
<P>The Deceas'd Emperors Wives Brother, call'd <HI>Xibatadono,</HI> being the nearest of his Relations left alive, stomach'd much at the Proceedings of <HI>Toquixiro,</HI> and oppos'd him in what he might; whom to remove, being such a Block in his way, he resolv'd, if possible, to destroy, and immediately sat down and vested the Fort wherein he resided with a close Siege. <HI>Xibatadono</HI> finding him∣self thus suddenly surpris'd, and so straightned that there was no means left to escape, call'd a Council of all his Friends, thus saying, <HI>You all know our hard Con∣dition; and for my part, rather than yield to the cruel Tyrant, I am resolv'd to end this wo∣ful Life by Self-slaughter: All my Request is, That after Death,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Self-murder committed by <HI>Xibatadono,</HI> and by all the Besieg'd.</NOTE> <HI>you will see my Fune∣rals in Fire, and that nothing be left of me for that inhumane Rebel to boast of.

<P><HI>Xibatadono</HI> return'd them all Thanks for their Fidelity towards him: But before he took leave of this World, he made them a Funeral-Feast, loading his Tables with all Varieties, the Roofs resounding with Vocal and Instrumental Musique, such as the Place afforded; Bowls of their beloved <HI>Chiaw,</HI> and Wine still handed about. So after they had Treated to the height, they rose, first fil∣ling the Hall with Combustible Matter, as Bavins, Brush-wood, and the like, which firing, and the Flames at last ascending through the Roof, then the bloody Banquet began. <HI>Xibatadono</HI> first fell upon his Wife and Children, and their Servants, running them through, or otherwise mortally wounding them; who was follow'd by the rest of his Captains and Officers, in like manner dispatching their Relations and Retinue: Then throwing their Bodies into the Flames, and standing upon them, they ripp'd up their own Bowels.</P>

<P>¶ THis City <HI>Hannibal</HI> Storm'd in three Places, and chiefly against a low part of the Wall, which he set upon with several Engines for that purpose: But the Besieg'd bestirr'd themselves so valiantly against the Assail∣ants, that they made great Slaughter amongst them: <HI>Hannibal</HI> himself, being wounded in the Thigh with a Pike, was forc'd to Retreat, and the Army rest∣ed till their General was cur'd; who then mustering his Forces, afresh Be∣sieg'd the City closer than before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange destruction of <HI>Saguntus.</HI></NOTE> a hundred and fifty thousand being daily in Arms, against whom the <HI>Saguntines</HI> were forc'd to keep Watch on all Corners.</P>
<P>The Enemies Battering-Engines had by this time made Breaches in the Walls in several Places; three Towers undermin'd, also turn'd topsie-turvey: So that the City lay in a manner open and undefended, and the Soldiers which fill'd the Breaches were naked and without shelter, having neither Battlements nor Breast-works against which <HI>Hannibal</HI> drew up his whole Army. Hope spurr'd on the Assailants, and Desparation kept the Defendants in their Stati∣ons; so the Storm was very fierce, long, and well maintaind: <HI>Hannibal,</HI> if his Men did their parts, not doubting but to carry the City, made a fierce Assault; the <HI>Saguntines</HI> making good their Breaches with Throngs of Soldiers, match'd with equal Valour the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> in so close a Body, that the Enemies Ar∣rows never mist a Mark.</P>
<P>The <HI>Saguntines</HI> answer'd them with thrown Javelins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Darts.</NOTE> carrying Wild-fire; which were so terrible, and did such Execution, that <HI>Hannibal</HI> was forc'd to Retreat.</P>
<P>Thus both Parties being tired, there hapned a short Cessation: Onely the <HI>Saguntines</HI> labour'd day and night, to make up the Breaches of their ruin'd Walls. Soon after <HI>Hannibal</HI> giving the Plunder of the City to the Soldiers, made a more fierce and general Assault.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Saguntus</HI> is divided in the middle.</NOTE>But the <HI>Saguntines</HI> having divided the Town, rais'd a new Wall with the old Houses.

In the <HI>interim,</HI> their Wants began daily to increase, and their Hopes of being Reliev'd by the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> vanish'd; the Enemies never ceasing from Storm: For though <HI>Hannibal</HI> went with a part of his Army against the <HI>Oretans</HI> and <HI>Carpetans,</HI> which he much fear'd; yet <HI>Maharbal, Hamilcar</HI>'s Son, went on so fiercely, that none could ob∣serve the Generals absence, pulling down the new Wall in three several Pla∣ces, and setting upon them with such fury, that he made himself Master of some of their Fortifications.

With these Proposals of Agreement <HI>Alorcus</HI> went
<PB N="183" REF="123"/>over the Walls into the City; at whose coming, all the Council gather'd: Thither the People also repair'd from all Corners, to hear the News.

This occasion'd a sudden Alteration, which was agitated by a great Cry from the Fortification; for a Tower having been storm'd and shaken a long time, fell to the Ground, which making a great Gap in the Walls, a whole Band of <HI>Africans,</HI> seeing the Guards fled to the Market-place, throng'd in: Of which <HI>Hannibal</HI> having sudden notice, immediately enter'd the City, without any resistance, with several thousand Men: But the Citizens, in like manner as <HI>Xibatadono,</HI> in a moment set Fire on all their Houses, chusing rather to be burnt with their Wives and Children, than to be slain by <HI>Hanni∣bal</HI>'s Sword.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Toquixiro</HI> having Conquer'd <HI>Xibatadono</HI>'s Castle, he return'd to <HI>Meaco,</HI> where he not only chang'd his first Name <HI>Toquixiro,</HI> but also his second, <HI>Faxiba,</HI> which <HI>Nobunanga</HI> had given him, calling himself <HI>Cambacun∣dono,</HI> that is, <HI>Supreme Lord of Japan;</HI> and after that, <HI>Anno</HI> 1504. took upon him the Name of <HI>Taicosama,</HI> that is, <HI>Mighty Emperor.</HI></P>

Whereupon, after serious consideration, <HI>Taicosama</HI> thought no way convenienter, than to employ these Princes, and busie them where they might spend their Time, and show their Valour in some Foreign Countrey.

<P>The Soyl of this Countrey being very fruitful, produces Rice, and Tares twice a year; no place affords better Paper and <HI>Cie,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Sandaracha,</HI> than this Isle: This <HI>Sandaracha</HI> is much us'd by the <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Japanners,</HI> for they Plaister all their Walls with that Lime.</P>

<P>The four Northern Territories bordering next to <HI>Tartary,</HI> he had already miserably ruin'd, when the King of <HI>Corea</HI> rais'd an Army to oppose the <HI>Tartars</HI> (who then design'd to Besiege the Metropolis <HI>Pingjang</HI>) chusing a convenient place for Ambuscade, to surprise them in their March, and, as design'd, sud∣denly sallied out upon them, suspecting there no Opposition; both Sides fight∣ing very fiercely: Yet the <HI>Coreans,</HI> for all their Advantage, had been utterly defeated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A cruel battel betwixt three enemies.</NOTE> but that <HI>Moavenlung</HI> accidentally fell into their assistance, being new∣ly Landed, galling the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the Rear; who seeing themselves block'd up, as in a Sack, steep Mountains on each side, before them the <HI>Coreans,</HI> and behind the <HI>Chineses,</HI> would not stand still in this exigency or danger, for they saw no way to get out, but what the Sword must make, whereupon they ga∣thering fresh courage, a cruel fight began, the like scarce ever heard of by An∣tiquity: The <HI>Tartars</HI> at last made their way through the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and fled Northerly towards the Kingdom of <HI>Niuche,</HI> leaving behind him (as they say) on the spot fifty thousand men; neither had the <HI>Chineses,</HI> nor the <HI>Coreans</HI> this Victory for nothing, for the first bought it with ninety thousand men, and the other with seventy thousand, insomuch, partly, that neither could boast their victory, or pursue the flying <HI>Tartar.</HI></P>

<P>The Governor of the <HI>Philipines</HI> stood amaz'd at this strange Letter, very well knowing the Power, Pride, and Ambition of <HI>Taicosama,</HI> whose Friendship, if he would preserve, he had no other means but to answer him with all respects; for which purpose, he sent <HI>Lupo de Liano,</HI> with Missives to signifie to the Em∣peror, That the <HI>Philipines</HI> Governor had receiv'd a Letter from his Imperial Majesty, but without being Sign'd by his Royal Hand, therefore he had not the confidence that he could willingly have wish'd for, especially, because the Jesuites in <HI>Nangesaque</HI> (who held some Correspondency with him) had given him no manner of Intelligence thereof.</P>
<P>This Answer, not onely displeas'd the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor, but he was much startled thereat, because no Transactions, nor ought else, private or publick, that was worthy of information could happen,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hazart.</HI> Church Hist 5.6.9.</NOTE> but as Father <HI>Hazart</HI> says in his <HI>Church History,</HI> the Jesuites gave Intelligence of to their Concerns abroad, which they well observ'd, and left no stone unturn'd, that might improve their in∣telligence.</P>

<P>This jealousie of the Emperor was fomented by an Apostate <HI>Castilian</HI> at <HI>Saxuma,</HI> who being revolted from his Religion, became a severe Persecutor of the Christian Faith; insinuating to the Emperor, that the Jesuites would never be obedient, longer than needs must, to his Commands; and the whole Design was, to introduce their Doctrine amongst the <HI>Japanners,</HI> which was no other, but to ferment Sedition to such a Rebellion, that first might tread down all subordinate Authority, and at last supplant the Emperor himself, and so bring the whole Nation under the Subjection of that Catholick Tyrant, the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Promotes his Brothers Sons to high dignities.</NOTE>¶ BUt before <HI>Taicosama</HI> began the Wars with the <HI>Coreans,</HI> he Promoted his Brothers Sons, having no Children of his own, to high Dignities and Honor; the eldest, whom he alotted to be his Successor, he Crown'd King over five Kingdoms; the second over three, lying near <HI>Meaco;</HI> and to the youngest, he gave two; preserving fifteen for himself, with the Supreme Com∣mand over all. The remaining Provinces and Territories were divided amongst his Courtiers, Generals, and nearest Friends, with Proviso's, to pay an Annual Tribute to the Emperor. But those Princes which were not remo∣ved, were oppress'd by Taxes, that they were scarce able to rebel, living conti∣nually in fear, on one time or other to loose life and all.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His intention about the common War.</NOTE> And indeed it was so design'd, for he had no other intention to make Wars with the <HI>Coreans,</HI> but that those Kings which he sent thither might be ruin'd there, or at least so much Work to do, that they should not disturb him in his Dominions; or if they should in any time Conquer <HI>Corea,</HI> then he would give them the Conquer'd Territories in exchange for those in <HI>Japan,</HI> that so he might be absolute Governor over his own Empire at home.</P>

<P>But the Kings and Princes which he imploy'd for <HI>Corea,</HI> never scented in the least that he had laid this Plot for their destruction, and the enjoying of their Estates, pretending nothing, but the care of theirs and the publick good; so that they went chearfully abroad, with an Army of sixty thousand men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Forces goes to <HI>Co∣rea.</HI></NOTE> and soon after follow'd a hundred and forty thousand more, which Forces Land∣ing in <HI>Corea,</HI> in a short time carrying all before them, made themselves Masters of the Metropolis <HI>Pingjang,</HI> and most part of the Island; yet oft they met with repulses and great obstructions for the <HI>Chinese</HI> Auxiliaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chineses</HI> assist the <HI>Coreans.</HI></NOTE> which still came fresh and fresh, maintaining a doubtful War six years, and drove them at last towards their Landing-place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beat the <HI>Japanners</HI> from <HI>Corea.</HI></NOTE> where they were sorely gall'd by twelve well man'd Fortresses, that oft Sally'd out upon them; so that they were forc'd to make a dishonorable Peace, the relinquishing of all their Conquest in <HI>Corea.</HI></P>

<P>Mean while, he carry'd himself so cunningly, and with such humility, ta∣king no notice of his Jealousies or Discontent, that he made him change his Resolution; so that he set forth eight days after the first appointed time on his Progress; for if he had not gone, it would have been look'd upon as ill-na∣tur'd, and that he sleighted the company of the several Princes, which were to be also at the Feast.</P>
<P>The Progress was perform'd in the following manner:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes to visit <HI>Quabacon∣dono.</HI> Sumptuous train of <HI>Man∣docorosama, Taicosama</HI> his Consort.</NOTE>¶ <HI>TAicosama</HI> sent his Empress <HI>Mandocorosama</HI> before him, which then resi∣ded in <HI>Fissima,</HI> three Miles from <HI>Meaco:</HI> In sumptuous manner she led the way, before her went a great number of Nobles, marching in order, more than an hour passing along; these had several Files of Musqueteers, being their Guard walking before them, their Arms being Varnish'd, glitter'd against the Sun like Gold; behind the Nobles were carry'd three great Wax'd Chests, with the Empress <HI>Mandocorosama</HI>'s Apparel; after these came fifty more that bore Vestments of her Ladies of Honor; these were follow'd by six∣teen brave Horses, Loaden with Gold, cover'd with Sumpter-Clothes Im∣broyder'd with Pearls, Plumes waving on their Heads, the Richness of which amaz'd the beholders: Which Gold was an accustom'd Present from the Emperor and Empress to the young Emperor. Next, march'd in a <HI>Cavalcade</HI> bravely Mounted, fifty prime Lords belonging to the Court, each attended by thirty Pages; then came eight <HI>Quirosols</HI> or Sedans, each carry'd by thirty two
<PB N="191" REF="127"/>men, in these the prime Ladies of Honor sate, which were follow'd by <HI>Man∣docorosama</HI> in a Sedan, carry'd on the shoulders of Persons of great Quality; this Sedan, or rather, Moving-house, was so curiously Wrought with Carv'd Work, that the Artists not onely got great Reputation for their several hands, but an incredible Sum of Money for their Reward of well-doing, from the Empress; in this she sate so private, that she could be seen by none, but her self might see whom she pleas'd, then follow'd a hundred Sedans more, of the same fashion, but of less value, in which sate several Queens and Princesses, gaudily drest, attended by a hundred and fifty Ladies of Honor, all gallantly mounted, with Silken Vails, each of them attended by a great number of Lac∣quies, and a Groom waiting, with two led Horses.</P>
<P>And lastly, The whole Procession was clos'd by the several Maids of Ho∣nor, carry'd in little two-Wheel'd Chariots, which as the Print represents, are shod at the ends with Plates of Silver and Gilt; the Spokes of Cedar, Carv'd and Gilt, the Fellies of the Wheels shod also with Copper; the Seat in the Stern, fitted to hold one in great State, spread with Tapistry, which hangs down be∣twixt the Wheels; the empty part before fashion'd like an Oval, is open, she having a stately Canopy over her, defends her from Rain and the Sun, and when she pleases, she draws her ty'd-up Curtains to keep off the Wind, being driven along by a lusty Man, with two Poles athwart his shoulders: With this Train, <HI>Mandocorosama</HI> enter'd the Burrough <HI>Jurazu,</HI> presenting to <HI>Quabacondono</HI> a great Mass of Gold, and other inestimable Jewels; which kindness of hers was bountifully rewarded by <HI>Quabacondono,</HI> who was also very liberal in bestow∣ing the like rich Presents on her.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sumptuous train of <HI>Tai∣cosama,</HI> going to <HI>Quabacon∣dono.</HI></NOTE>The following day, <HI>Taicosama</HI> came from his Castle, from whence, a little before, most of the <HI>Japan</HI> Nobility went to <HI>Juraru;</HI> the ways between <HI>Taicosa∣ma</HI>'s Palace and <HI>Juraru,</HI> were Guarded on both sides by Souldiers, each standing two strides from the other, Arm'd with a naked Scymiter; these belong'd, and were under the Command of the Lord of <HI>Mino,</HI> Grand-Son of the slain Em∣peror <HI>Nobunanga,</HI> and therefore the just Heir to the Crown: Between these Guards, past first three hundred Persons of prime quality, every one having their several Escutchions, with all their Emblasonings, carry'd before them, with clusters of Pages and Lacquies; after these came several Princes, some of which carry'd the Swords, others the Daggers and other Arms of <HI>Taicosama.</HI> These were again follow'd by <HI>Taicosama,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Taicosama's</HI> rich Chariot.</NOTE> who sat on a rich and magnificent Chariot, which had cost him several Tun of Gold, for the sides and middle were adorn'd with unexpressable Imagery and Carv'd Work, and also the four Seats cover'd with Massie Gold, were much to be admir'd; with the Axeltree on which the Wheels turn'd, and the Spokes and Fellies were all of Silver. This Chariot was drawn by two black Oxen with Gilded Horns, their bodies spread over with Purple Clothes, Embroyder'd with Precious Stones. <HI>Taicosama</HI> us'd these Oxen, not for want of Horses, for several thousands serv'd him in this Train; but as a testimony, that he observ'd the Antient Customs, establish'd many Ages before by the <HI>Dayro's,</HI> which were always drawn by Oxen, when ever they went to any grand Entertainment, still attended by a Guard of Nobles.</P>
<P>Thus attended, <HI>Taicosama</HI> entred <HI>Meaco,</HI> where he was met by a thousand, all Persons of Quality, sent from <HI>Quabacondono;</HI> who as soon as ever they drew near the Emperors Chariot, light from their Steeds, those before <HI>Taicosama</HI> do∣ing the like; these dividing to each side, standing close up, made a Lane for

<P>In the most eminent Streets they drew near, making a stop, whilst <HI>Quaba∣condono</HI> dispatch'd the Vice-Roy of <HI>Meaco,</HI> to congratulate <HI>Taicosama</HI>'s Aggress, who sent the Lord of <HI>Tangi,</HI> to Complement the Messenger sent from <HI>Quaba∣condono.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quabacondono</HI> meets him.</NOTE> Both meeting and Saluting betwixt the Chariots, and having done their several Congees, the Lord <HI>Tangy</HI>'s Coach return'd; whereupon the Vice-Roy call'd after him, saying, <HI>Quabacon vonariscens cu Banazi,</HI> that is, <HI>Quabacon wishes that your coming to his House may be in the presence of Millions, and last ten thousand Ages;</HI> which was answer'd by <HI>Taicosama</HI> in his Coach with a loud voyce, <HI>Sachighe Icatei Icarei,</HI> which signifies, <HI>Let him drive before, and I will immedi∣ately follow.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole Train enter the Castle <HI>Jurazu.</HI></NOTE>At the end of this Ceremony, the Lords which Guarded one side of the Street, re-mounted their Horses, and follow'd <HI>Quabacondono</HI> to <HI>Jurazu. Taicosama</HI> staying some small time, also went on in a good Order: Before the whole Solemnity was past, the Sun had almost finish'd his days Journey.</P>
<P>The Master of the Ceremony, to whom the whole Care and Conduct of this Feast was committed, was <HI>Genefoin,</HI> Governor of <HI>Meaco.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Taicosama</HI> came before the Castle <HI>Jurazu,</HI> Riding over the Bridge to the inner Court, there being welcom'd by all the Princes, where he deliver'd his Presents to <HI>Quabacondono;</HI> who seem'd not able to express the high esteem and value thereof: And that he might no way be indebted to his Unckle for these his great Favors, he return'd his kindness by giving him also many rich Gifts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sumptuous Entertain∣ment there.</NOTE>Three days did this great Reception and Entertainment last, nothing being wanting that either delighted the Eye, Ear, or Palate: the Tables still cover'd, and full of all manner of Varieties, which the Earth, Sky, and Sea could af∣ford, Dish'd up with all the skill their Cookery could invent, to invite the Palate, and add fresh appetite; Vocal and Instrumental Musick, according to their manner, every where, and in every Room; each day their Theatre throng'd with the primer sort, where they had several Comedies prepar'd by the Learned, and those who were skilful in Poesie, for the present Entertain∣ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of their Tilt∣ing.</NOTE> not wanting variety of Scenes according to the Argument; also in run∣ning at a Carv'd Head (to which sport came the Emperor and all his Nobi∣lity,) some running at it with a Spear, others striking at it with a Bill, and some shooting at it with Bowe and Arrows, or Guns, in manner as appears by the following Sculp.</P>
<P>But whilst these Jollities and continual Feastings were perform'd to the heighth, with all the Pomp and <HI>Decorum</HI> imaginable, the Emperor <HI>Taicosama</HI> had but little rellish thereof, still alarm'd with fresh fears and jealousies, which Melancholy and Age made greater and more imminent than they were; and though there were something of reality, yet he startled at as many shadows, which often his troubled Fancy presented, expecting hourly some Bloody Plot should discover it self to the danger of his Life: to prevent which, for his better safety, being very subtile, he set private Guards and Watches of those whom he could trust, who still shifting Places, kept all Passages to the Empe∣ror's Lodging, so that none could stir upon any Conspiracy or private Design, but they would as suddenly perceive their Motion, whilst the old Man, a cunning and experienc'd Dissembler, shew'd not the least sign of suspicion, but

with all complacency and kindness, even to doting, courted and flatter'd his young Nephew, seeming not able to forbear to pour out his dear affection, and how much he lov'd him, which appear'd evidently by what he had done, and should be more manifest by what he would do for him; and also told him, that he did assure himself of the like returns of his affections and kindness to∣wards him, since nothing could be more impious and inhumane, than for him to contrive any thing detrimental to his Honor, or dangerous to his Person.</P>
<P>The young Emperor was no way wanting in his Expressions, and soft re∣turns to his Unckle, wishing on himself, with many Execrations, some mis∣chief might befall him, or any that ever harbor'd the least thought which migh be prejudicial to his dear Unckle and kind Father, who by his adoption had made him Heir to his Empire, and already possess'd him with five weal∣thy Kingdoms, and now had confirm'd all this by the honor of his Visit.</P>
<P>Thus both vizarding their intentions, they play'd a hard and wary Game, whilst all the Court and City saw through the young Man's subtile glozings, that he had no less design, when ever opportunity presented, than the utter ruine and destruction of his Unckle; which his intention on the second Night of this great Entertainment, was verily believ'd to have been put in execution, by an accident that then alarm'd the whole City, which was this:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Accident in <HI>Jurazn.</HI></NOTE>The Royal Theatre being much too little for so mighty a Concourse as at that time repair'd thither, Noble-men, Princes, nay, Kings themselves, if co∣ming late, were forc'd to return back again, the House being cramm'd so full, and many that were within so thrust and crowded, that they rather suffer'd torture, than any delight from the presented Comedy: to remove this incon∣venience, that there might be nothing wanting at so high an Enterview, and Meeting of so many Princes, there was immediate order given to erect ano∣ther Theatre that Night against the next Day, ample enough to contain so great an Audience: The multitudes of Workmen which were thus suddenly emploi'd, bussling up and down with Lincks and Torches, making every where a con∣fus'd
<PB N="194" REF="129"/>hurry and noise, which awaked the Court and all <HI>Meaco,</HI> every one start∣ing from their Beds, believing that what they so much fear'd, was in agitati∣on, at least the death of an Emperor: but day-light approaching, the mistake vanish'd, finding that all this stir was onely about a new Theatre.</P>
<P>So this magnificent Feast ended as silently as it began, without any other disturbance than the error of that Night.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A sumptuous Banquet prepar'd by <HI>Fidandono.</HI></NOTE>From thence both the Emperors were invited with their whole Retinue, to a Dinner prepar'd by <HI>Fidandono,</HI> one of the greatest Princes in <HI>Japan;</HI> which was perform'd with such wonderful abundance and Magnificence, that you may compute the extraordinary Charge by the Leaf-gold, which onely trick'd up their Dishes, amounting to above four thousand Crowns, but the charge of their Potations rose much higher; foreach Draught that he drank to the Emperor, which must be nine, the first costing him by way of Present ten thou∣sand Crowns, the second more, so increasing, till the last, doubling the first, came to twenty thousand Crowns; so that the whole Charge of the Treat∣ment seems incredible, being scarce to be reckon'd: all this was to keep in, and preserve his favor with the Emperor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And also by <HI>Gietazo.</HI></NOTE>Next day the Emperor <HI>Taicosama</HI> Progress'd to <HI>Gietazo,</HI> Governor of eight Provinces, where he was Entertain'd with no less State than by <HI>Fidandono.</HI></P>

Amongst other great Men and Princes in his Palace was <HI>Gefonio,</HI> Nephew to the late Emperor <HI>Nobunanga,</HI> whom <HI>Taicosama</HI> privately incited, by commending of his agility in the like Exercises, that so encourag'd he might get the same and praise from his Nephew: But he being more wary than to stir up any displeasure from <HI>Quabacondono,</HI> whom he suppos'd would succeed in the Imperial Throne, perform'd his Exercises rather worse than better, so keeping in favor with the young Emperor: which <HI>Taicosama</HI> obser∣ving, call'd <HI>Gefonio</HI> aside, and changing his note, commended now his Pru∣dence beyond his Activity, telling him that he was much troubled, that the Son of such a Father, rais'd to that Dignity and Honor which he now enjoy'd, should be sent thus by his Nephew as an Exile, under the pretence of Com∣manding an Army, to the utmost Confines of his Empire; but he would for his Unckles sake prefer him on the next opportunity to a nearer Employment, and make him a Governor of more Provinces than one; and for the present, as a testimony of his favors, he desir'd him to accept of ten thousand Bags of Rice.</P>
<P>But <HI>Quabacondono</HI> being sumptuously entertain'd in <HI>Fissima,</HI> would no ways be behind in repaying such Favors to <HI>Taicosama:</HI> And having erected a stately Palace at <HI>Fissima,</HI> where he prepar'd a rich and costly Banquet, invited his Unckle <HI>Taicosama</HI> thither; who fearing to deny the Request, yet put it off from day to day, under a pretence of indisposedness. which continu'd so long, that <HI>Quabocondono</HI> observing it to be onely an excuse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quabacondono</HI> parts dis∣contented from <HI>Taicosama.</HI></NOTE> return'd much displeas'd to <HI>Jurazu:</HI> This stirr'd up in him distrusts, and thoughts of self-preservation, and his Unckles destruction; but all this he kept secret, as if he seem'd not to have the least thought thereof, spending much of his time in seeing Sports and Exercises, inviting whoever were famous for Dancing, Fencing, Wrestling, Archery, Martial Discipline, and the like, with several Prizes and Rewards to

Secondly, How it suited with the honor of an Emperor, to cut and mangle in publick his innocent Subjects? Thirdly, Why he kept so many Soldiers in Arms, thereby disturbing the Empire with fears of some great and sudden alteration? Fourthly, Why he doubled his Life-guard, being Musqueteers, with a thousand Men? Lastly, Why he dealt in private with the <HI>Japan</HI> Princes, to take the Oath of Allegiance to be faithful to him? Closing with a desire to know if he had any thing to alledge against him.</P>
<P>Mean while <HI>Taicosama</HI> sent a subtil Negotiating old Lady, well stricken in years, to <HI>Quabacondono</HI>'s Court, to prie into affairs, and gather what she could from the present Humor and Discourse there, but especially concerning their opinions of the five Queries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quabacondono</HI>'s Answer.</NOTE>The Commissioners presenting the Queries to <HI>Quabacondono,</HI> he not asking long time to answer, told them, That he was much troubled with the rising of the Spleen, and overflowing of the Gaul, and by the advice of his Doctors he was order'd to lay all business aside, and affairs of State, and follow bodily Exercises for his recovery; That playing the Executioners part was prescrib'd also for his Health, and that none suffer'd by his Hand, but such as were noto∣rious Malefactors; That his Soldiers and double Life-guard were not to em∣broil in War, but to preserve the Peace of the Empire, but more especially to defend his dear Unckle, now grown old, from sudden Insurrections that might arise from the already-murmuring People; and lastly, That the Oath which he requir'd of the Princes, was to keep them in Unity amongst themselves, and better under the subjection of his Imperial Majesty.</P>
<PB N="196" REF="130"/>
<P>Whereupon the Commissioners reply'd, That <HI>Taicosama</HI> would without all doubt be well satisfi'd with, these his Answers, if he would but be pleas'd to Write and Sign them with his own Hand; which <HI>Quabacondono</HI> perform'd, and sent with all speed to <HI>Taicosama:</HI> who as soon as he receiv'd and read the Pa∣per, cry'd out aloud, saying,<HI>O apparent testimony of my dear Nephew's innocency! how deceitful is this wicked World! who could believe that scandalous and backbiting Tongues, still buzzing Tales, should raise such misapprehensions between me and my always-faithful</HI> Quabacondono?</P>
<P>These emphatical Expressions of the old and cunning Dissembler were be∣liev'd to be real, and immediately sent in Writing by his Friends to the young Emperor, which so lull'd him asleep, that he dream'd of nothing less than the secret displeasure of his Unckle: which <HI>Taicosama</HI> did to no other end, but to get time to strengthen his Forces, which were then too weak to encounter with his Nephew, who was in a ready posture of defence; so that he could not do any thing but by fair means,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Raises Forces privately.</NOTE> till such time as his Militia (which he privately rais'd through all <HI>Japan</HI>) were drawn to <HI>Fissima.</HI> And indeed he carry'd his De∣sign so closely, that <HI>Quabacondona</HI> had not the least information of it, little suspect∣ing any thing, because the Princes from all Parts made daily Addresses to him, with joyful Congratulations for the happy and undoubted Reconciliation betwixt him and his Imperial Unckle, whose affections were such, that he would (now growing old) soon establish the sole Government upon his dear Nephew.</P>
<P>During this kind correspondency between both, <HI>Taicosama</HI> had information, how that the Princes which he had commanded, were marching on in their Way from <HI>Vacaza</HI> to <HI>Fissima.</HI> And now the time came which he had so long expected to perfect his Design:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Threatens <HI>Quabacondo∣no</HI> exceedingly.</NOTE> whereupon he sent Messengers to <HI>Quabacondo∣no,</HI> with strict Commands to come to <HI>Fissima,</HI> and there to answer to whatever should be objected against him; which if he refus'd, he would take such a course, that the present World should tremble thereat, and his Successors stand amaz'd when ever related: for first, he would utterly destroy the Castle <HI>Ju∣razu,</HI> and all other Buildings rected by <HI>Quabacondono,</HI> with Fire; and whoever he found that made the least resistance, should perish without mercy by the Sword; and if possible, utterly eface, and cut off his Memory from the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Quabacondono</HI> saw himself now in the Trap, and that it was then altogether too late to make the least resistance, since <HI>Taicosama</HI> had gotten so great an Army together, which he was not able by any means to withstand; so no way but pa∣tience,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quabacondono</HI> surrenders himself to his Unckle, and is by him banish'd to the Cloyster <HI>Coja.</HI></NOTE> he with a small Train deliver'd up himself to the mercy of his Unckle: the Ways being all beset with strong Guards, about Noon he came to <HI>Fissima,</HI> and passing by the Palace he took up his Lodging in a private House; but in the Evening he receiv'd Order from <HI>Taicosama</HI> to retire to the Cloyster <HI>Coja,</HI> built on the craggy Mountains in the Kingdom of <HI>Chinocuno.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Coja</HI> was the Residence for all banish'd Princes, before the barren Island <HI>Faitsintchina,</HI> fourteen Leagues at Sea Eastward from <HI>Jedo,</HI> was made fit for that purpose.</P>

to such a Nephew: He had oftentimes before been displeas'd, and was as easily reconcil'd; what madness would it be for him to bereave himself not one∣ly of Life, but of the Imperial Throne? and though he had no hope of it, yet he ought not to despair; and fortune was so unconstant, that oftentimes the meanest were rais'd to high Dignities: and that it behov'd a Prince to have and bear a noble courage in his greatest calamity, and not suffer any sorrow whatsoever to take possession of his heart; and that without dispute <HI>Taisacoma</HI> could not live long, at whose Decease they doubted not but to be released, and he restor'd to his former Honor. The <HI>Japanners</HI> were now curb'd and kept in fear, but so soon as they could be freed thereof they would not be so forget∣ful, but remember that <HI>Taicosama</HI> had given the Empire to <HI>Quabacondono,</HI> to whom it belong'd in his Life-time, and therefore was most justly his after the Emperor's death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quabacondono</HI> and all his Company are commanded to rip up their own Bowels.</NOTE>Thus chearing him up with future hopes, they kept him a while from lay∣ing violent hands on himself, when soon after <HI>Taicosama</HI> sent a Messenger, to command him and his Company, according to the <HI>Japan</HI> manner, to rip open their own Bowels. No sooner had they receiv'd their Condemnation, but they all prepar'd themselves to die. The first that cut up his Belly was <HI>Quaba∣condono</HI>'s Page, being a Youth of nineteen years of age; who whilst he was struggling with Death, <HI>Quabacondono,</HI> after he had embraced him, chopp'd off his Head, which he set in a Charger on a Table: The like he perform'd to two more of his Servants. The next that was to do the cruel Office on him∣self, was the <HI>Bonzi (Biuscirtus,</HI> whose Grandmother was sent by <HI>Taicosama</HI> to <HI>Quabacondono</HI>'s Court as a Spie; and because she had carry'd her self well in that business, her Son <HI>Biuscirtus</HI> he commanded to be sav'd: but he refus'd the Em∣peror's mercy, saying with an undaunted courage to him that brought the Or∣der, <HI>I scorn to take any thing from that Bloodhound that should deserve my thanks, for I will rather chuse to die with</HI> Quabacondono, <HI>than to live in slavery under such a grand Tyrant:</HI> this said, he desperately stabb'd himself; but suffering much under
<PB N="199" REF="131"/>the agony of a lingring Death, <HI>Quabacondono</HI> gave him present ease by chop∣ping off his Head; which was no sooner done, but with the same Weapon he stabb'd himself. One onely remaining, slew himself with his Masters Scymi∣ter. The Execution was no sooner finish'd, but the <HI>Bonzies,</HI> performing their Office, consum'd them together in one Funeral Fire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Taicosama</HI> destroys all the Confederates of <HI>Quaba∣condono.</HI></NOTE>But <HI>Taicosama</HI> rested not thus; but following his Blow, hunted and de∣stroy'd all those his Friends and Intimates that had been Abettors with <HI>Quaba∣condono</HI> in this Conspiracy. The first with which he began, were three Per∣sons of great Quality, that were fled to a Cloyster of the <HI>Bonzies:</HI> The next was <HI>Scirabingo,</HI> who made the Kings to Sign the Oath of Allegiance to <HI>Quaba∣condono,</HI> for which Crime he was judg'd to suffer a cruel Death: But none was more lamented than <HI>Chimura,</HI> who had done <HI>Taicosama</HI> great Service, both in War and Peace; but because he had held private Correspondence with <HI>Quaba∣condono,</HI> he was also condemn'd to be his own Destroyer.</P>
<P><HI>Chimura</HI>'s Son hearing of his Fathers Misfortune, who was then in <HI>Saicoure,</HI> wrote to him, <HI>That a Wise-man might easily look Death in the face, especially if he suf∣fer'd innocently; and that it was no trouble to leave this World, for a far more happy Life, which would last for ever: And thither he was resolv'd to accompany him, as his Fa∣ther; for he would not live after his Death, of whom he had receiv'd Life.</HI> So whilst he expected to hear the sad Tydings, he call'd for a Chest of Scymiters, out of which chusing the best, he girded it about his Waste. In the interim the News of his Fathers Death, and <HI>Taicosama</HI> came to him together; the Emperor proffering him Life, notwithstanding he was <HI>Chimura</HI>'s Son, who ought, accord∣ing to the <HI>Japan</HI> Laws, for his Fathers Crime, to suffer Death.</P>
<P>But the Youth return'd <HI>Taicosama</HI> Thanks, telling him, <HI>That he was bound in Conscience to take Revenge of the horrible Slaughter committed on his Father</HI> Chimura; <HI>and seeing no possible Means to effect such his Design, he would rather die than live, want∣ing satisfaction for his Fathers Death.</HI> Thus said, he immediately deserted the Court, and went to <HI>Meaco,</HI> where going into the Temple, there offering his Devotions to the Idol <HI>Fotoco,</HI> ripping up his Belly, he Sacrific'd his Life before the Altar.

I therefore have thought none more fit than your self, by reason of your admir'd Wisdom, to under∣take so grand a Concern. And here I leave you my Empire and Son, that you may restore it to him when he is fifteen years old. If those former Favors, which I do not doubt but you acknowledge with Thanks, do not bind you to a faithful performance of this Trust, yet I hope your Care will be the more, when my Son shall marry with your Daugh∣ter, by which means the Empire will ever be Commanded by our Race, and both our Succes∣sors sway the</HI> Japan <HI>Scepter.</HI></P>

However, all my Abilities shall be laid out to yours and your Sons Service, in such manner, that had I a thousand Lives, I would freely and with much joy sacrifice them all for the sake of</HI> Taicosama <HI>and his Seed: And indeed have made it my sole Study, since your Majesties Sickness, to use all Care and Diligence for the promoting of</HI> Fideri, <HI>before you your self made your Will known to me.

<P>These Words <HI>Ongosschio</HI> utter'd with a passionate grief; and having ended his Speech, the young Prince <HI>Fideri</HI> and <HI>Ongosschio</HI>'s Daughter came before <HI>Tai∣cosama</HI> lying on his Death-bed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage concluded be∣tween <HI>Fideri</HI> and <HI>Ongosscio</HI>'s Daughter.</NOTE> there to be joyn'd in Marriage, according to the <HI>Japan</HI>-Customs: And notwithstanding the Emperor lay striving with Death, yet their Wedding-Solemnities were perform'd after the ancient manner, onely narrow'd into the compass of one day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Taicosama</HI> takes the Oath of Allegiance of the Kings.</NOTE>After the Feast ended, <HI>Taicosama</HI> requir'd all the Kings and Vice-Roys to swear Allegiance to <HI>Fideri,</HI> and that they would establish him in the Throne in his fifteenth year; and mean while give due Obedience to <HI>Ongosschio,</HI> as being his Guardian till of Age. <HI>Ongosschio</HI> seal'd this Oath with his own Blood: And <HI>Taicosama,</HI> to oblige those which had sworn, gave them all, according to their several Qualities, many rich Presents: And this Bounty extended so far, that several of his old Servants got great Riches by it. Besides <HI>Ongosschio,</HI> he chose four Councellors of State, to assist him in the Government, and present∣ly after appointed <HI>Asonodangio,</HI> a Person highly esteem'd in his Favor, to be Pre∣sident of the Council; and in the mean while, to leave all Officers in their respective Places, and to break no manner of Laws or Orders establish'd in his Life-time.</P>
<P>Then he advis'd the Council to be Faithful and Loyal amongst themselves, without which no Government could subsist long: And for the preservation of such a Unity and Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Makes Marriages to keep them all in peace.</NOTE> he made several Nuptials upon his Death-bed, joyning those of the Noblest Houses in Marriage together, taking several Kings Daughters, and bestowing them on other Kings Sons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why he inlarg'd the Castle of <HI>Osacca.</HI></NOTE>He enlarg'd also the Castle of <HI>Osacca,</HI> and built therein many Palaces, in which the chiefest Lords, with their Families, were to reside: For expediting which Work, thousands of Artificers were imploy'd. And to the end he might obtain his desire, he commanded, that his Death might be kept private for a time; which he did, because <HI>Japan</HI> upon the Decease of the Emperor being subject to many Civil Wars, the foremention'd Castle should be fully finish'd; and that the Kings which were far from their own Countrey, and without any Forces, might be kept there as in a Prison, till the Council were fully setled in their Authority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Would be honor'd as a God after his death.</NOTE>¶ BUt long before, <HI>Taicosama</HI> had taken great care to make himself Immor∣tal: For which purpose he in his Life-time built a Temple, reckon'd amongst the stateliest in <HI>Japan;</HI> in which he erected a Golden Image, represent∣ing
<PB N="203" REF="133"/>him to the life, which stood on Marble: His Body he order'd to be put in a Coffin, without burning, according to the common Custom.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is carry'd into a higher Chamber.</NOTE>At length he desir'd to be carried (out of the hearing of any Noise) into an upper Chamber, in the Castle <HI>Fissima,</HI> that he might lye quietly, without any disturbance: So taking leave of all the Princes, and his Son <HI>Fideri,</HI> admonish∣ing him from that time forwards to call <HI>Ongosschio</HI> Father, and shew him due Reverence and Respect, being now deliver'd into his Custody, and he chosen as his Guardian: And also gave order, That few Nobles should come in his Chamber, and his Physicians should not stir from his Bed-side; and, if possi∣bly they could, to study for some Medicines to preserve his Life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes a great sorrow.</NOTE>Upon this parting, all the Courtiers began exceedingly to lament, seeing their Emperor, by whom every one expected to be preferr'd, carried away, never after to be seen alive. The Noise and Cry was so great within, that it was heard without the Castle, whose Gates were strongly guarded; but this coming to the Peoples Ears, gave supition that <HI>Taicosama</HI> was dead.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The report of his death occasions great Uproars a∣mong the People.</NOTE>The Report of which spread up and down the Countrey like Wild-fire: Whereupon the Thieves sally'd out from their several Recesses, robbing and pillaging whom ever they met; and in some places the People began to Muti∣ny, not much unlike the <HI>Roman</HI> Tumults, whilst the Cardinals are about the Election of a new Pope. But the chief Insurrection here was in <HI>Osacca, Mea∣co,</HI> and <HI>Fissima,</HI> insomuch that the Great Council were too weak to quell the Re∣bellion. This Rumor of <HI>Taicosama</HI>'s Death was credited the more by the Com∣mon People, because the Council had guarded the Fort of <HI>Fissima</HI> round about with new Soldiers, and Listed Forces in all Parts, wheresoever they could get them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How it is found not to be true.</NOTE>Ten days together this Belief continu'd: But the Emperor in this interim growing somewhat better, sent two of the Council to <HI>Osacca,</HI> with Orders to get the Castle finish'd, that was to be built there, with all expedition; and also gave to the several Princes design'd to go from <HI>Fissima</HI> thither, divers Bags of Rice, and great Sums of Money.

These Orders once publish'd, the Work went on day and night; insomuch that a new City and Castle appear'd at once. This Building stopp'd the Rumor that went of the Emperor's Death: for every one might well judge, that the Council would not take so great a Work upon them.</P>

<P>This Exchanging of Names, when Men are Registred amongst the number of the Deities, was formerly very common, both with the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans:</HI> For <HI>Romulus</HI> was call'd <HI>Quirinus; Juno, Matuta; Leucothoe, Albunea; Melicerta, Palaemon; Leda, Nemesis; Circe, Marica; Nersilia, Hora; Rhea,</HI> Mother of the Gods; <HI>Idaeda, Dindymeda; Philena, Pissinuntia; Cibele, Berecynthia.</HI></P>
<P>To Create Princes for Gods, for their Valiant Exploits and Noble Atchieve∣ments, took not its Original in <HI>Japan,</HI> but was a Custom above two thousand Years since; which the ancient Father <HI>Lactantius Firmianus</HI> witnesses,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lactant. de Fals.

Because they were the Greatest and Powerfullest Kings, and are for Commemo∣ration Consecrated, for a Reward of their Valiant Acts, or for their Bounties, or No∣ble Arts found and invented by them; and because belov'd by their Subjects.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Common amongst the Ancients to make Men Gods.</NOTE>It was common amongst the <HI>Greeks</HI> to Worship deceas'd <HI>Heroes</HI> for Immor∣tal Deities: As the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> did <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> General of the Army that lay ten Years in Siege before <HI>Troy;</HI> and with him, his Brother <HI>Menelaus,</HI> the <HI>Spar∣tan</HI> King.

<P>The <HI>Argives</HI> honor'd <HI>Perseus</HI> as a God, for his Noble Exploits. The <HI>Epidaneans</HI> worshipp'd <HI>Aesculapius,</HI> because he had found out many Mysteries for Curing

<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> ador'd the Soothsayer <HI>Amphilochus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Liv.</HI> lib. 45.</NOTE> whose Temple, as <HI>Livy</HI> re∣lates, though very ancient, yet was pleasant to behold, being surrounded by Fountains and Brooks of Fresh-water. Moreover most of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Kings are Registred among the number of the Gods. In like manner they chose <HI>Triptolemus</HI> for a Deity, because he first invented Plowing and Sowing; and <HI>Euricthonius,</HI> because he was swallow'd up by the Earth, with a Chariot and four Horses.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cicer. de Nat. de Or. <HI>li. 3.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Erechteus</HI> they promoted with his Daughters above the Stars, be∣cause the Father obey'd the Oracle at <HI>Delphos,</HI> presaging the Victory to the <HI>Athenians</HI> against the <HI>Thracian Eumolpus,</HI> if the King did Sacrifice one of his Daughters; and the Virgin, because she died willingly for her Countreys sake in the Village <HI>Hyacinthus,</HI> was made a Goddess.</P>
<P><HI>Theseus</HI> also, having fought valiantly against <HI>Taurus,</HI> which was <HI>Minos</HI> the King of <HI>Creta's</HI> General, had a Temple erected in the middle of <HI>Athens,</HI> in which his Bones were worshipp'd.</P>
<P>The same Honor was done to <HI>Codrus,</HI> because he went in Beggars Weeds into the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> Army, there wrangling with the Soldiers, till he was kill'd, that by his Death the Conquest might fall on the <HI>Athenians</HI> side, as the <HI>Delphian</HI> Oracle had foretold.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Curt.</HI> lib. 7.</NOTE> Therefore <HI>Augustus</HI> says, <HI>The</HI> Athenians <HI>worshipp'd</HI> Codrus <HI>as a God, because he went and sought his own Death for his Countreys good.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> ador'd their King <HI>Liber,</HI> he being the first that press'd Wine out of the Grape: And besides <HI>Liber,</HI> his beautiful <HI>Ino,</HI> with her Son <HI>Melicerte,</HI> because they both leap'd from a high Rock into the Sea.

<P>Furthermore, there were formerly few Kings, and chiefly over <HI>Egypt, Per∣sia,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> which if they had us'd no Tyranny, were either in their Life-time, or at least after their Death, worshipp'd as Gods. <HI>Cleo,</HI> Shield-bearer to <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> says thus in <HI>Curtius</HI>'s History; <HI>The</HI> Persians <HI>worship not onely their Kings for Gods with great Zeal, but very circumspectly; for</HI> Hercules <HI>and</HI> Bacchus <HI>themselves were not install'd amongst the Gods, before they overcame the Malice of their Maligners.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissention among the Council.</NOTE>Furthermore there arose a great Dissention among the Lords of the nine Kingdoms, call'd by one Name <HI>Scimo;</HI> some declar'd themselves for the Grand Council, others for <HI>Daifusama,</HI> and many were willing to stand Neuters. The Princes <HI>Arimandono,</HI> and <HI>Omurandono,</HI> first joyn'd themselves with their Forces to the Grand Council; but being order'd to march with their Parties nearer to <HI>Meaco,</HI> they fell off and sided with <HI>Daifusama.</HI></P>
<P>The Grand Council had sent several Forces through the Empire to encoun∣ter with with those that joyn'd with the King's. The business growing thus to a Head, Forces Mustering from all Places, they were resolv'd to put it upon the Dye, and try their Fortune in the event of a Set-Battel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They joyn their Strength together.</NOTE> designing the Place of Rendezvouz for their best advantage to be in the Plains of the Kingdom of <HI>Mino;</HI> where not long after their whole Forces were drawn together, being about fourscore thousand Men, much too strong for <HI>Daifusama,</HI> who had scarce thirty thousand.</P>
<P>The Council miserably perplexed the whole Business and Affair, by tedious Controversies and scrupling Delays, being thirty Days in making ready before they set upon the weak Enemy; who in that time made benefit of their tardi∣ness; for <HI>Daifusama</HI> sent his Son away with a part of the Army towards <HI>Con∣gueraso,</HI> and the rest he carry'd to <HI>Oari;</HI> to which out of <HI>Mino</HI> and other Coun∣treys he added so many as now made up fifty thousand Men, with which he not onely fac'd, but first engag'd the Council.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The shameful and hor∣rible overthrow of the mighty Army of the Coun∣cil.</NOTE> The Battel was scarce begun, but <HI>Ciunangodono,</HI> Nephew to <HI>Taicosama</HI>'s Wife, by whom came the Kingdom of <HI>Cicugen,</HI> deliver'd out of the Prison in <HI>Voari,</HI> where he was put when he quitted the Fort <HI>Guifu,</HI> revolted with his Regi∣ment, and went over to <HI>Daifusama:</HI> after him follow'd three other Regiments with their Princes, who contrary to the Design of the Council, took this op∣portunity to do Service to the other Party. Hereupon there arose aloud mur∣muring, and a voyce through the Army, crying <HI>Treachery, Treachery;</HI> and withal a sudden disorder, that the Officers neither could keep them in Rank nor File, deserting their Colours, and crowding, trod one another under foot. The Van-guard thus totally routed, fell into the Main Body, and disorder'd them also, <HI>Morindono,</HI> who had the left Wing, wheel'd off, not striking one Stroke, and fairly fled away; and the Rear seeing the Van routing the Main Body, fearing they would both fall foul upon them, threw down their Arms, each one shifting for themselves, so that in few hours the Field was clear: but though they ran thus early away, yet they escap'd not so, for most of them pe∣rish'd by their own Weapons, or the Enemies, who suddenly pour'd himself in amongst them. Amongst those which were taken by <HI>Daifusama,</HI> was <HI>Gibu∣noscio,</HI> and <HI>Augustine Tzunocamindono:</HI> the first acknowledg'd, that he had not the heart to rip himself up; the second refus'd self-murder, being a <HI>Christian;</HI> but most of the rest that fled, not knowing where to shelter themselves, were their own destroyers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Daifusama</HI> prosecutes his Victory.</NOTE><HI>Daifusama</HI> made no small use of this Victory, the Field lying cover'd with

Being thus crown'd with suc∣cess, he march'd on, and first took all the strong Holds in <HI>Mino;</HI> and then en∣tring with his Army into the Kingdom of <HI>Omi,</HI> the fame of his Victory came before him to the Castle of <HI>Savoiama,</HI> belonging to <HI>Gibunoscio,</HI> whose Brother at that time was Governor there; who much startled at the sad News, and see∣ing no possibility to withstand his Forces, he bethought himself of a Delivery by a <HI>Happy Dispatch,</HI> for so the <HI>Japanners</HI> call Self-murder; on which having fully resolv'd, he first distributed what Treasure was in the Castle to the Sol∣diers, bidding them take that and shift for themselves: next killing his Wife and Children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horrible Murder with∣in the Castle of <HI>Savoiama.</HI></NOTE> he set fire on several places of the Castle, and at last was his own Executioner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Daifusama</HI> was afraid of <HI>Morindono.</HI></NOTE>The Conqueror finding the Fortress all in flames, suppos'd it no fit place to make a halt, no longer than to look upon it, but that he might loose no time, march'd directly for <HI>Morindono,</HI> having brought off the left Wing from the last Battel intire; and having re-inforc'd himself with forty thousand more, fear∣ing this gather'd Cloud now impending, and ready to break upon his head, therefore he march'd speedily from thence to be further from the danger, since the fortune of War is doubtful; for the Conqueror was sufficiently wary, least any slur, or the least accident should happen or cast a blemish on so signal a Victory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His great strength.</NOTE>But that which troubled <HI>Daifusama</HI> more, was the strong Castle of <HI>Osacca,</HI> not to be parallel'd in all <HI>Japan;</HI> so that a great Army lying down before it might easily be moulder'd away, e're they could make the least advantage, to hope thereby to obtain the place; and what made it more difficult was, that <HI>Morindono</HI> kept there the Treasury of the whole Kingdom; there were in custo∣dy all the Hostages, even those that held with <HI>Daifusama,</HI> and <HI>Fideri</HI> himself, <HI>Taicosama</HI> 's Son.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The strength of the Ca∣stle of <HI>Osacca.</HI></NOTE> Moreover, there lay within the Castle so much Provision of Victuals, and Ammunition for War, that the Garrison might hold out a Siege of many years, without the least want or distress.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Daifusama</HI> gets the Ca∣stle of <HI>Osacca.</HI></NOTE>¶ IT seem'd almost incredible to <HI>Daifusama,</HI> that he should become Master so easily of such an impregnable Hold, which had it stood out, had stopt the whole Course of his Victory, that lingering there, had probably ruin'd him and his whole design; so with this, whatever could be desir'd fell into his hands, all places striving who should first submit to the Conqueror, who durst not so much as offer, or once think of opposing him, now ready to as∣cend the Imperial Throne. <HI>Fideri,</HI> the onely Block to stop the ambitious As∣pirer in his Enterprise, that Rub remov'd by his Death, there was no other obstacle to hinder him from being sole Emperor of <HI>Japan:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And therewith all <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE> Such was his success, that he sleighted <HI>Cangueraso,</HI> as if no body, who was yet in Arms, and raising Forces in behalf of the Grand Council, on the utmost borders of <HI>Quanto,</HI> and also the King of <HI>Sassuma,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The dexterity of the King of <HI>Sassuma.</HI></NOTE> of whose Valor he had sufficient proofs in the last Battel; for being quite out of hope of Rallying his Forces, to give the Enemy another Charge, made his way onely with sixty Men through the main Body of the Army, with which, hasting to <HI>Osacca,</HI> where with an addition of

<P>And although <HI>Ciunangodono,</HI> in the late Battel happening between the Council and <HI>Daifusama,</HI> revolting, went over to him; by that means throwing so great a Victory into his Lap, yet he was so far from making any kind return, or ac∣knowledging in the least so high a benefit, that on the contrary, he dispossess'd him of the Kingdom of <HI>Cicugen,</HI> and secur'd him in the Cloyster <HI>Coja,</HI> being a Pri∣son for Prime Persons, and kept by the great Master of the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> where <HI>Quaba∣condono</HI> three years before did Execution upon himself; where also he and many other Persons of Quality suffer'd in like manner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle of <HI>Ʋto</HI> defen∣ded it self stoutly.</NOTE>¶ WHile <HI>Daifusama</HI> thus domineer'd every where, nevertheless, <HI>Canzviedono</HI> fell into a part of <HI>Fingo,</HI> belonging to <HI>Tzunocamindono,</HI> and there stor∣med the Castle of <HI>Uto,</HI> yet spent all their labor in vain, for the Garrison behav'd themselves exceeding manfully; their Assaults were repuls'd with great Losses, and their Sallyings forth, daily weaken'd the Besiegers, so that they began to loose their courage: <HI>Canzviedono</HI> endeavor'd by all ways and means to make known to them, that the Grand Councils Army was overthrown, and the Ca∣stle of <HI>Osacca</HI> taken; that <HI>Daifusama</HI> Triumph'd victoriously every where, and that their Lord <HI>Augustin Tzunocamindono,</HI> for whom they fought couragiously, was Executed. But the Garrison in the beginning of the Siege, had sworn to one another, upon pain of Death, not to receive any Letters or Messages from the Enemies; wherefore being mutually agreed, they cast all the Arrows which had written Papers wrapt about them instantly, without reading, into the fire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Jesuites</HI> were sought to for the delivery up of <HI>Ʋto.</HI></NOTE><HI>Canzviedono</HI> was amaz'd at this stubbornness, who could not remove his Seige with Honor nor Advantage, and his Power and Policy being spent in vain, he then at length apply'd himself to the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> (as the Jesuite <HI>Valentine Carvaglio,</HI> writing from <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> the five and twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> in the Year sixteen hundred and one, to <HI>Claudius Aquaviea,</HI> Chief Governor of the Society of <HI>Jesuites</HI> makes mention) to whom he sent Letters to <HI>Nangesaque</HI> to this purpose:</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are cast down at this demand.</NOTE> But the <HI>Jesuites</HI> were amaz'd at this Command, and chiefly, that there should be a change of Government (as <HI>Japan</HI> was many times subject to such alterati∣ons of State) therefore they besought with gentle Intreaties to put it off, saying, <HI>They were Spiritual Persons, and taught the way to Heaven, and transitory Affairs was

<P><HI>Canzviedono</HI> did no ways accept of this their excuse, but threatned to put the five Fathers in <HI>Uto</HI> to death; and furthermore, to banish all the rest out of <HI>Ja∣pan,</HI> as being <HI>Daifusama's</HI> Enemies: So at last the Garrison receiv'd all infor∣mation concerning the Transactions between the Emperor and Council; by which they judg'd it better to make an agreement, being not able to stand out alone; so that <HI>Canzviedono,</HI> after being sufficiently weary'd out, obtain'd his desire.</P>

<P>The Captain of the Ship sent three of his Officers to Complement <HI>Spex</HI> and <HI>Segerssoon,</HI> and soon after several Messengers to invite them to a Collation; but the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ambassadors, judging that he ought first to give them a Visit, they excus'd themselves.</P>

Furthermore, the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor, as <HI>William Adams</HI> understood from <HI>Cosequidonne,</HI> had enquir'd about the Lading, which the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ship had brought to <HI>Firando;</HI> upon which, the Ambassadors rested not, but instantly drew an Inventory of all her Lading, which they sent by <HI>William Adams</HI> to <HI>Cosequidonne,</HI> with a request, that he would speedily dispatch the desir'd Letters of License, that the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships might Trade without any molestation in <HI>Japan:</HI> In answer whereof he brought them word, That the Letters of License lay ready, onely they wanted the Imperial Signet, which should be ready on that day, or at farthest, on the morrow.</P>
<P>Where whilst they staid waiting for it, they saw in their Lodging one <HI>Jacob</HI> a <HI>Japan Christian;</HI> being Captain of <HI>Junck,</HI> who formerly had been kept by <HI>Wittert,</HI> Governor of the <HI>Manillies,</HI> and complain'd much of the injury done him by the <HI>Netherland</HI> Mariners, who gave out, That they prejudic'd onely the <HI>Ca∣stilians</HI> and <HI>Portuguese,</HI> but indeed, they made a prey also of the <HI>Japanners,</HI> and said, If this misdemeanor should come to the Emperors Ear, it would be bad for the <HI>Netherlanders.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cosequidonne</HI> in the mean time, towards the Evening, sent twenty <HI>Japan</HI> Shifts to <HI>Spex,</HI> and ten for <HI>Segerszoon,</HI> to demonstrate (as the Messenger express'd it) his affection towards them. The last of <HI>August, Williams Adams</HI> receiv'd the two re∣quested Letters of License, with the Imperial Seal; instantly, the Ambassadors caus'd them to be Translated out of the <HI>Japan</HI> Tongue, into <HI>Low-Dutch,</HI> and found them word for word, which were to this effect:</P>

<P>The Ambassadors were much troubled at the expressions in this License, be∣ing not full enough to their desire and intentions, wanting the chief and grand concern, <HI>viz.</HI> That they should not be molested with Searchers and Cu∣stomers, in the Delivery, Lading, and Sale of their Goods, which were vexatious to all Merchants whatsoever, especially as they found, to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> the chiefest being <HI>Saphidonne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Saphidonne</HI> suppress'd the <HI>Netherland</HI> trade in <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE> who exacted Fees, Duties, and Customs more than any, being very greedy and troublesome, of which, were the Emperor inform∣ed, would cost him his life, though his Sister was one of the Emperors Con∣cubines.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The condition of the <HI>Ne∣therlanders</HI> with their Let∣ters of License.</NOTE>But it was very difficult to lay the Plot for the destruction of this <HI>Saphidonne,</HI> who was so eminent a Person; and certain they were, that the Emperor would enquire why the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ambassadors should insist so particularly upon him, that by vertue of the Letters of License, their Goods should not be stop'd nor seiz'd by his Majesties Officers of the Custom; also they would run no less danger, to request the amending or augmenting of a Letter Grant∣ed by the Emperors Favor.</P>
<P>Yet at last they concluded to venture on one of them, whereupon, on the first of <HI>September, Spex</HI> and <HI>William Adams</HI> made their Address to <HI>Cosequidonne; Spex</HI> thanking him for the speedy procuring the Letters of License; who ask'd, if there were not enough inserted in; they answer'd, Yes: onely there wanted the Emperors permission, for the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ship to deliver and sell the Goods without the disturbance of Waiters and overseers; whereupon, <HI>Cosequidonne</HI> assur'd them, that none should in the least molest them; wherefore he had sent a Letter to <HI>Saphidonne,</HI> commanding him not to hinder the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> in the delivery or sale of their Merchandize, for he had receiv'd certain informati∣on, that <HI>Saphidonne,</HI> according to his own pleasure, and not in such a manner as he ought, seiz'd their Goods, and hinder'd their sale, of which they had never complain'd, but for great reason. <HI>Spex</HI> requested <HI>Cosequidonnes</HI> own Hand-wri∣ting to make use of, if they should hereafter suffer more injury by <HI>Saphidonne;</HI> and also, if he found the business of so weighty a concern, to procure from the Emperor his Imperial License, to deliver and sell, without molestation; but <HI>Cosequidonne</HI> judg'd it to be needless, so long as <HI>William Adams</HI> staid, in <HI>Surunga,</HI> to whom he might write over concerning any miscarriage, against which there should speedy order be taken.</P>

On the seven∣teenth of <HI>October, Anno</HI> 1613. they were led out of the City; at which time it
<PB N="213" REF="142"/>was present death to be a <HI>Christian,</HI> and yet twenty thousand Christians came to∣gether, and divided themselves into several Companies, carrying lighted Tor∣ches, and wore red Caps, walking six and six in a row, in the same manner as they go in Procession in <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> strowing the Paths which they pass'd with Coral and Bays, to the honor of all the Saints. The Martyrs went forth from amongst the Company into the foremention'd House, where every one embrac'd a Wooden Pillar; but whilst the Executioner was tying them fast one after another to the Posts, <HI>Leo Canyenon,</HI> none knew how, got upon the top of the House, and call'd from thence with a loud voyce, saying, <HI>Brothers, this day appears the power of Faith in</HI> Jesus Christ, <HI>whilst we gladly endure the Flames, which can scarce devour our Bodies; but we shall be rais'd out of the Ashes, to be preserv'd at the day of Judgment from everlasting Fire in a most blessed Life: Brothers, be constant to the Law of God, and account him above your lives and fortunes.</HI> Thus having finish'd his Discourse he descended, and suffer'd himself to be ty'd to the eighth Pillar. When they were all bound, the Jesuits Commander, <HI>Gasper,</HI> shew'd them the Picture of <HI>Jesus</HI> ty'd to a Post, and miserably Whipp'd in the Synagogue; and calling upon them said, <HI>Look how much you resemble our Saviour when he suffer'd un∣der</HI> Pontius Pilate: <HI>This is he for whose love you die, who exprest his affections before∣hand when he dy'd for you, to live in him that arose alive from death: He will crown you in Heaven with glorious Crowns.</HI> The Executioners staid for the finishing of <HI>Gas∣per</HI>'s Speech, then setting the Stakes about the Straw-house on fire, the Martyrs standing about three Foot from it, that so they might roast by degrees. Mean while the Strings with which <HI>Magdalen, Fayaxinda</HI>'s Daughter was made fast being burnt, she fled, not from the Fire, but went and took many glowing Coals, placing them on her Head like a Crown. The Cord of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s young Son was also burnt, and he ran to his Mother <HI>Martha,</HI> who bid him call upon <HI>Jesus Maria.</HI> Thus much in short of what <HI>Hazart</HI> relates, with many Circum∣stances of Words and Deeds describ'd at large.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Daifusama <HI>persecutes the</HI> Roman Christians.</NOTE>But it is very well known, that <HI>Daifusama</HI> did persecute the <HI>Christians</HI> very severely, and by strict Edicts commanded all his Substitute Kings to prosecute and punish them according to the Laws; so that in the Kingdom of <HI>Bungo</HI> they were burnt, and in the Province <HI>Chicuin</HI> hang'd up by the Legs.</P>
<P>And here <HI>Orbedono</HI> sat in the City <HI>Facata</HI> representing the King, at the en∣trance of one of their Temples, with four Judges, holding a great Book, in∣dors'd thus, <HI>A Catalogue of the Names of those that deny'd Christ:</HI> In which every one were to subscribe that return'd again to their former Faith; and those that would not were sure to suffer intolerable punishments and death.

In the West they had subdu'd a whole new World, call'd <HI>America;</HI> and still not being satisfi'd with so great a Conquest, was come through the unknown South-Sea, and had there made himself Master of seve∣ral Territories in the East; the <HI>Molucca</HI> Islands, the Castle <HI>Malacca,</HI> and the far-spreading <HI>Philippines</HI> being all under his subjection, from whence he might, when he pleas'd, send over his Forces to <HI>Japan;</HI> not that they are so near that the <HI>Philippines</HI> may be seen from <HI>Japan,</HI> as <HI>Hazart</HI> without reason sets down, their nearest Promontories being at least two hundred <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles distant from each other, but that <HI>Japan</HI> being already full of Foreigners which were up in Arms, and also well stor'd with <HI>Christians;</HI> who knew, but that together in a short time they might deliver it up to a <HI>Christian</HI> Prince?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Reason.</NOTE>The second Reason <HI>Hazart</HI> tells us was this: A Ship lying at Anchor in a <HI>Japan</HI> Haven, one <HI>Yamondono,</HI> a Gentleman of that Countrey, desirous to see the same, went Aboard, where he found the Master looking over the Map of the World: <HI>Yamondono</HI> entreated him to instruct and inform him concerning the Territories, Mountains, Rivers, Cities, and Havens therein. Nothing more amaz'd him, than to see the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have Command over so great a part of <HI>Europe, America,</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> and that they still held their Possession. But the Master being examin'd farther, told him, That his Countreymen drove a Trade with all the World, and that no People suffer'd any damage by them, but what wrong any did them they righted by Arms; with which they had subdu'd many Kingdoms. <HI>Yamondano</HI> desir'd to know if they did not send their Ministers beforehand, to gain the hearts of the Inhabitants by Preaching the Doctrine of <HI>Christ,</HI> and to stir them up against their Heathen Governors, to the end that when any Insurrection should happen, they might by a con∣junction with the male-content Natives, enable themselves to a more easie Conquest: The Master acknowledg'd that was the Design of their Priests: which <HI>Yamondono</HI> laying up in his mind, soon after sent word thereof to the Emperor; who slept not upon so weighty a Matter, but resolv'd suddenly to free himself of the Popish Clergy, as his Predecessor <HI>Taicosama</HI> did, <HI>Anno</HI> 1587. commanding them all in twenty days to depart from <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fathom the <HI>Japan</HI> Har∣bors.</NOTE>This News of <HI>Yamondono</HI> was back'd by another casual Information given to <HI>Daifusama,</HI> That a <HI>Spanish</HI> Pilot had fathom'd, and with a Plummet sounded the depth of several <HI>Japan</HI> Harbors, which was suspected to be done for no other end, but that they intended to Land in some of those Places, and to sub∣due <HI>Japan,</HI> as they had done many Provinces both in the East and West.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Reason of the Persecution <HI>Hazart</HI> lays upon the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hol∣landers.</HI></NOTE>The third Reason of the Persecution, <HI>Hazart</HI> lays the blame thereof upon the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who reported that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had aim'd along time to make themselves not onely Masters of <HI>Europe,</HI> but the West part of the World; and to that end, not many years since they had made great slaughter in <HI>Peru, Mexico, France, Netherlands,</HI> and other Places, that no Age ever heard of so many and so cruel; That they sent their Priests beforehand to prepare the ways, and under a cloak of Religion to draw the People to their humors, ex∣torting great Riches from them; and making them believe, that the Pope hath an absolute and unlimited Power, to dispose of all Kingdoms and Provinces, ac∣cording to his will and pleasure, and that Subjects therefore are not ty'd to be
<PB N="223" REF="143"/>always obedient to their Heathen Governors, but might release themselves when they saw a convenient opportunity; That the Jesuits crept in every where, and by subtile Plots and Contrivances sought to dethrone Princes, cau∣sing many Murders and Uprores where-ever they came; for which cause seve∣ral <HI>Christian</HI> Princes oftentimes, banish'd them from their Courts and Coun∣treys. In <HI>France</HI> stood a long time an Iron Plate, whereon was Engraven all the Villanies for which they were banish'd out of that Countrey. The <HI>Sor∣bonne</HI> in <HI>France</HI> presented some years past a Writing to the Court, wherein they shew'd, that the World never bred more traiterous and bloody Villains than the Jesuits. The Cities <HI>Antwerp, Padua, Bruges, Tholouse, Bourdeaux, Prague,</HI> and other Wall'd Places, oftentimes for their horrid and abominable actions have thrust them forth. And had not the wisdom of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Governors been deluded along time by their dissimulation of Zeal, they had not so long been pester'd with them: But quickly the <HI>English, Scots,</HI> and several other Kingdoms, had rid their hands of them by banishment. This <HI>Hazart,</HI> being himself a Jesuit, sets down as the most prevailing Reason and Motive that stirr'd up <HI>Dai∣fusama</HI> against the <HI>Roman Christians,</HI> and chiefly the Priests.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth Reason.</NOTE>But the last Fast Fault he lays upon the <HI>Japan</HI> Prince <HI>Portasius,</HI> who being King of <HI>Arima,</HI> pretended to be highly in Favor with the Emperor, because his Son had married <HI>Daifusama</HI>'s Niece, and therefore sought no small share of the Province <HI>Figen,</HI> which by Inheritance he laid claim to: For the obtaining this his desire, he sent <HI>Paulus Daifachi,</HI> an expert Courtier, and great Favorite of the Emperor's, with many rich and costly Presents, to deliver to <HI>Daifusama;</HI> which he refusing, were imbezell'd away. Upon notice whereof, and ob∣serving the Protractions us'd in his Business, <HI>Protasius</HI> was displeas'd with <HI>Dai∣fusama</HI>'s Dealings, and apprehended some danger therein. The best way for prevention whereof, and to know where the business halted, he resolv'd in Person to go to the Emperor; to which purpose he went accompany'd with his Son <HI>Michael</HI> and Daughter in Law: But both of them had a wicked design in their Heads to Murder <HI>Protasius,</HI> because he would not, according to the <HI>Japan</HI> Custom, being over-grown in years, resign up his Province. <HI>Protasius</HI> having receiv'd a denial concerning his business, was banish'd, and <HI>Daifachi</HI> came to a miserable end, being condemn'd with his Wife to Ride on gall'd and sore Horses through the Streets of <HI>Surunga;</HI> and on the one and twentieth of <HI>April, Anno</HI> 1612. ty'd to a Stake surrounded with Fire, at three Foot distance from him, and so by degrees was roasted to death: His Wife obtain'd some fa∣vor, having with patience view'd her Husbands deplorable end.</P>
<P>This <HI>Protasius</HI> had been a chief promoter of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion in <HI>Arima,</HI> which was ill resented by <HI>Daifusama,</HI> and the more because he did not deliver up the Crown, being antient, to his Son, as the <HI>Japan</HI> Custom was, but kept the Authority in his own hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fifth Reason why <HI>Daifusama</HI> persecuted the <HI>Christians</HI> in <HI>Japan</HI></NOTE>Besides these Reasons of <HI>Hazart,</HI> I find a fifth the occasion of the Persecution in <HI>Japan,</HI> mention'd in the daily Annotations, or Journal of the Embassy of <HI>Frisius</HI> and <HI>Brookhurst,</HI> namely the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Priests (as the <HI>Japanners</HI> say) had formerly great priviledges allow'd them, insomuch that they Preach'd their Doctrine, and spread their Religion, as if they were Natives of the Countrey, whose Faith was grounded with the peopling of <HI>Japan.</HI> They built also Churches, Cloysters, and Schools, planting religious Orders, as in one Place, <HI>The Society of the holy Virgin,</HI> by <HI>Didacus Gonnoia,</HI> besides many others, as well <HI>Franciscans</HI> and <HI>Dominicans,</HI> as <HI>Jesuits,</HI> had spread themselves all over <HI>Japan,</HI> and
<PB N="224" REF="144"/>by their Masses, Confessions, Purgatory, and such like, got an incredible sum of Money of the poor innocent People, bringing every year little less than a Tun of Gold out of the Countrey, insomuch that where ever they came, they generally undid all the People; yet notwithstanding they charm'd them in such a nature, that their Word amongst them was a Law. They had now also got∣ten a Bishop at <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> and were Plotting to depose the Heathen Emperor from his Throne, and to set the Crown on the Head of a <HI>Christian</HI> Prince, un∣der whom they might have free liberty of publishing their Doctrine; but the Letter being discover'd, in which the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> had advice to make him∣self Master of <HI>Japan,</HI> the Emperor was so exceedingly enrag'd thereat, that forthwith he determin'd without mercy to destroy all the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> Of which not long after receiving informations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bloody Battel be∣tween the <HI>Japan Christians</HI> and <HI>Heathens.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Japan Christians</HI> drew together for their own defence; by which means they form'd a considerable Army of betwixt seventy and eighty thousand Men: Against whom the Imperial For∣ces drew into the Field, but were shamefully beaten and routed; yet soon af∣ter being again reinforc'd with fresh Recruits, they were commanded to fight to the last Man, and destroy the <HI>Christians</HI> without mercy: whereupon ensu'd another Battel, with resolution either to Die or Conquer; a long time the Vi∣ctory was doubtful on whose side it would fall, but at last the <HI>Christians</HI> were worsted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruel destruction of <HI>Ja∣pan Christians,</HI></NOTE>Soon after follow'd inhumane Cruelty and Murdering, whereby not onely the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Japan Christians</HI> were to suffer, but the <HI>Heathens</HI> swore revenge to the fifth and sixth Generation; nay, so far proceeded their malice, that whole Streets were carry'd to Execution, if onely one <HI>Christian</HI> had resided in it.</P>
<P>The foremention'd Examples did <HI>Daifusama</HI> follow in cold Blood, behead∣ing all the <HI>Christians:</HI> But because that did not seem a Death cruel enough to terrifie them, he afterwards commanded them to be crucifi'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> us'd in former times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dogs Crucifi'd</NOTE> betwixt the Temples of <HI>Sumanus</HI> and <HI>Inven∣tus,</HI> to Nail a living Dog on a Cross made of Box, tying a Goose on the top of it: This was done in Commemoration of the <HI>Senones</HI> coming from <HI>Gaul</HI> with a victorious Army, making themselves Masters of <HI>Rome,</HI> wasting the City, and putting all the Inhabitants to the Sword, except onely a few that escap'd into the Capitol, where they defended themselves manfully, frequently beating off the <HI>Senones;</HI> who having made divers attempts in vain, at length in a dark Night stole up the Hill; the Guards and Sentinels, tir'd out with Duty, and faln asleep, were like to have been surpris'd, had not some Geese which were Grazing upon the sides of the Hill, afrighted by the approach of the Enemy, by their loud Gagling, wak'd the Sentinel and Guards, and consequently sav'd the Capitol. But the Romans in process of time crucifi'd Men in stead of Dogs, of which the Slave which <HI>Plautus</HI> presents in his Comedy, says thus: <HI>I know the Cross must be my Grave,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plaut in Milite.</NOTE> <HI>threaten no more; my Ancestors carry'd it before my Fathers, Grandfathers, and great Grandfathers time.</HI> But the <HI>Romans</HI> us'd not to crucifie Slaves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who were Crucifi'd, and wherefore.</NOTE> unless they had committed great Crimes; as for example, if any one complain'd falsly against his Master to a Magistrate, or if he went to Soothsayers to enquire of his Master's death, or if they ran away: However, this kind of death was ordain'd for Malefactors, whose Condition was mean, and Crimes very hainous; but the better sort of Criminals were beheaded, of which the <HI>Roman</HI> Law saith thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paulus L. V. Cent. <HI>13.</HI></NOTE> <HI>It is thought fitting that all Murderers, if extract∣ed of a good Family, shall be beheaded, and the meaner sort crucifi'd, or thrown to wild
<PB N="225" REF="144"/>Beasts.</HI> When the <HI>Roman</HI> Priviledge was debarr'd by the tyranny of the Em∣perors, oftentimes, especially in the Army (where Law gives place to Arms) several Commanders, as Captains, Majors, Field-Marshals, and others, were Nail'd to the Cross.</P>
<P>But besides the <HI>Romans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thucyd.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.1.</NOTE> most known Countreys have cruel ways of Execu∣ting their Malefactors, which the <HI>Greek</HI> Writer <HI>Thucidides</HI> testifies of King <HI>Ina∣rus,</HI> who being taken by Conspiracy, was crucifi'd by the <HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crucifying usual in all Countreys, <HI>Rerod. Thebia.</HI></NOTE><HI>Herodotus</HI> relates, That <HI>Polycrates</HI> subdu'd the Island <HI>Samos,</HI> and all <HI>Greece,</HI> re∣joyced at his victorious Arms: his good fortune continu'd so long, that doubt∣ing it would at last prove cross, as an endeavor to prevent the turn thereof, he threw a Precious Stone into the Sea, which not long after he found in the Belly of a Fish, that being boyl'd was brought to his Table. But <HI>Polycrates</HI> died not so happy, for the <HI>Persian Orcates</HI> by subtilty taking him Prisoner in <HI>Magnesia,</HI> fulfill'd that which <HI>Polycrates</HI> his Daughter dream'd the Night before her Father went away, to wit, that she saw him taken up into the Air, and wash'd by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and dry'd again by the Sun; which <HI>Orcates</HI> perform'd in crucifying <HI>Polycrates,</HI> when the Heavens pour'd down upon him, and the Sun scorch'd him in such a manner, that his Fat dropp'd and ran down by the Cross.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch. in Vit, Herod. in Coll.</NOTE>In like manner did <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great crucifie the Physician <HI>Glaucus,</HI> and two thousand <HI>Tyrian</HI> Slaves; and <HI>Xantippus</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> the <HI>Persian Artyacta.</HI></P>
<P>They perform'd this bloody Office themselves purposely to delight the Spectators, who satisfi'd their Eyes by beholding them shrink up their Bodies, working of the Sinews and Veins, and pleas'd their Ears with the doleful cries of the miserable Wretches, dying by degrees.</P>
<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Gauls</HI> us'd this kind of punishment to Traitors and Rebels: But nore were more expert at it than the <HI>Africans;</HI> and amongst them the <HI>Car∣thaginians,</HI> oftentimes so using their Generals, if they came off vanquish'd, not∣withstanding they had fought valiantly, nay sometimes though they came home Victors; for if any thing of misdemeanor could be found against them, they died without mercy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers ways of Cruci∣fying.</NOTE>But they do not observe in all Places one manner, or way of Crucifying: for first, the Crosses differ'd in shape, and when great numbers were con∣demn'd, they oftentimes made Trees serve for that purpose. At other times they us'd single Poles, on which they Nail'd their Hands and Feet one over another. Others were made of two Pieces of Wood, or more: sometimes both Pieces are of an equal length, joyn'd together exactly in the middle, so that the hindmost part of the Crucifi'd comes just to the Place where it is joyn'd, and his Hands and Feet being stretch'd out, are made fast by four great Nails. The Church Histories tell us, That the Apostle <HI>St. Andrew</HI> suffer'd in that manner.</P>
<P><HI>Tertullian</HI> adds hereunto the Actions of <HI>Jacob,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. de Bapt. c. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> which laid his hands across when he blessed <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Manasseh,</HI> whereby he signifi'd, that future bles∣sedness should accrew to Mankind from the Cross of our Saviour.</P>
<P>At other times the Crosses were made of two unequal Poles, the longest of which being set in the Ground, and the shortest fastned towards the top, so that a small part of the longest appear'd above the other, on which was Writ∣ten the Crime for which they suffer'd; or else they carry'd the occasion of his Death on a Board before him to the Cross, or by a Cryer made it known to all the Spectators. Some Crosses had more than two Pieces of Timber; for
<PB N="226" REF="145"/>besides the upright and thwart Poles, there was a crooked Piece of Wood, in which the cross Pole rested: or on the upper end of the longest were two Pieces of Timber nail'd cross one above another: or else from the middle Piece hung two other Pieces of Timber downwards; or else the long Pole had two Sticks nail'd across, one above, and the other below; on the uppermost of which they made fast their Arms, and on the undermost the Feet. This last was in use amongst the <HI>Japanners.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Japanners</HI> make them fast.</NOTE> But in stead of nailing they ty'd them, sometimes laying the Cross down on the Ground, and there raising that and the Crucifi'd up together. At other times they first made the Cross fast in the Ground, setting three Ladders against it, on the middlemost of which the Suf∣ferer ascended, being pull'd up on both sides by Ropes made fast to his Hands. Sometimes they tie the Condemned to a cross Pole by his Hands, and then by two Ropes with a Pulley hoise him up to the top.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japanners</HI> also torture their Crucifi'd after another manner than the <HI>Romans, Greeks, Syrians, Persians, Africans,</HI> and other People. The <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> caus'd them to be Whipp'd with Scourges full of sharp Rowels, ei∣ther ty'd to a Pillar in the Court-house, or else all the Way till they came to the Cross.</P>
<P>The like relates <HI>Philo,</HI> how that the <HI>Roman</HI> General <HI>Flaccus</HI> caus'd a great ma∣ny <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Alexandria</HI> to be nail'd to the Cross, which had before, in the open Court, been miserably Whipp'd.</P>
<P>And <HI>Curtius</HI> relates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Curt.</HI> l. 7.</NOTE> That <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great resolutely caus'd the <HI>Sogdian Arimazes</HI> to yield up and withdraw from their invincible Rock, with thirty thousand Soldiers; of which he took the chiefest Commander, and Crucifi'd him at the Foot of the Rock.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Japanners</HI> Cru∣cifie.</NOTE>Moreover, others strip them stark naked as they were born: but the <HI>Japan∣ners</HI> tye them on two cross Pieces of Timber with their Clothes on. This Custom was also us'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> though but seldom.</P>
<P>Concerning the Apostle <HI>St. Andrew,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abdias Hist. Apol. <HI>l. 3.</HI></NOTE> the Historian <HI>Abdias</HI> relates, That the Vice-Roy <HI>Aegeas</HI> in <HI>Edessa,</HI> gave strict command to the Executioners not to nail him to the Cross, but to bind him, that he might be the longer dying: for at other times they use great Nails, whose number was left to the pleasure of the Executioner; most commonly they drove one through each Hand near the Wrist, and the Feet near the Leg: but at other times they strike several through their Hands, which they doe chiefly when they fear that the Nails will not hold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelty us'd in Cruci∣fying.</NOTE> but slip through the Hands, by which the whole weight of the Body hangs. The Martyr <HI>Agricola</HI> being made fast with divers great Spikes, died under the Executioners hands.</P>
<P>This cruelty seem'd less barbarous than that, when they made a great Fire under the Cross, so burning the Malefactor, or choaking him up with the Smoak. This kind of Death thousands of <HI>Christians</HI> suffer'd, while they were persecuted above three hundred years:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. Apol. Cult.</NOTE> wherefore, according to <HI>Tertullian,</HI> they generally went by the Name of <HI>Takkebos-Men,</HI> because they were burnt by the Boughs of Trees on the Cross.</P>
<P>The same Death the Martyr <HI>Polycarpus</HI> died.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb.</HI> l. 4. c. 17.</NOTE> It is remarkable what <HI>Eusebius</HI> Writeth concerning him: when the Executioners would nail him to the Cross, he said, <HI>Let me stand loose in the Fire, I shall be able, by Gods assistance, to en∣dure it with patience:</HI> whereupon they onely bound him to the Cross without Nailing.</P>
<P>It was accounted also a merciful Death to the Crucifi'd, to let Lyons, Ty∣gers,
<PB N="227" REF="145"/>Bears, and other Beasts of Prey, eat them from their Feet upwards: which manner of cruelty <HI>Nero</HI> us'd to the <HI>Christians.</HI> But commonly the <HI>Hea∣then</HI> endeavor'd to make them undergo a long and lingring Death, therefore sometimes tying them with their Heads downwards, Nailing their Arms athwart underneath, and their Feet on the upper part of the Cross.</P>
<P>The Martyr <HI>Victorinus</HI> being thus Crucifi'd by order of the Emperor <HI>Nerva,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Martyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l. Sep. <HI>5.</HI> Mai. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> liv'd three days, and <HI>Timotheus</HI> and <HI>Maura,</HI> nine, admonishing one another to be constant in their Faith; so that they oftentimes dy'd of Hunger, whilst the Blood slowly dropping from them occasion'd great faintness, and at last death: nor did their tyrannous rage end with their lives, but remain'd barbarously sal∣vage to their dead Bodies, which they permitted no Burial, but left exposed as a Prey for the Fowls of the Air.</P>
<P>Thus was the Sentence pronounc'd against the Martyrs <HI>Claudius, Asterius,</HI> and <HI>Neon: Let them be Nail'd to the Cross, that their Flesh may be devour'd by the Ravens.</HI></P>
<P>Those that were not by excess of Scourging before-hand tir'd out, liv'd a long time on the Cross: whereof some, according to <HI>Seneca,</HI> did spit on those that stood gazing on them. Others,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Just.</HI> l. 22.</NOTE> as <HI>Justinus</HI> witnesses of the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> concerning their General Bomilcar, rail'd at those that had caus'd them to be Crucifi'd. <HI>Bomilcar</HI> unhappily lay in <HI>Sicily</HI> in the Field against <HI>Agathocles,</HI> from whence returning, he was taken in the Market-place in <HI>Carthage,</HI> and Nail'd to a Cross, and from thence, as from a Stage, he related the treacherous dealings of his Subjects, charging sometimes <HI>Hanno,</HI> then <HI>Gisgo,</HI> and at last <HI>Hamilcar</HI> with several Crimes, of which he wish'd them to clear themselves.</P>
<P>Whilst these cruel ways of Crucifying were us'd, it happen'd sometimes, though very seldom, that by the favor and compassion of the Princes, the Cru∣cifi'd were taken off, and recover'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Josephus in sua vita.</NOTE><HI>Josephus</HI> relates, how that going from a Village to the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, he saw a great many <HI>Jews</HI> hanging on Crosses; amongst which were three that had for∣merly been his intimate Friends; and seeing them in that miserable condition, he immediately went to the General, <HI>Titus Vespasianus,</HI> to beg of him that he would grant him leave to take them down, which he permitted; but of those three, onely one was preserv'd alive.</P>
<P>To Rack the Crucifi'd for a quicker dispatch, was perform'd on the two Murderers which suffer'd with <HI>Christ;</HI> but that is not according to the <HI>Roman,</HI> but the <HI>Levitical</HI> Law, as you may read in <HI>Deuteronomy:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut.</HI> 21. <HI>Vers.</HI> 22, 23.</NOTE> <HI>If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree, his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day (for he that is hanged is accursed of God) that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ambrosius</HI> gives us his opinion thereof: <HI>It seemed,</HI> says he,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambr. in <HI>c. 3.</HI> in Rom.</NOTE> <HI>to be enough for a condemn'd Person that he is hang'd up, and dies on the Wood: for if he should hang longer, his Death would suffer more shame than his Crime had deserv'd, and would be a continual disgrace to his Posterity, when his Death should daily be reported up and down.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rack the Crucifi'd.</NOTE>But Racking was not usual with the <HI>Romans,</HI> who sought by long torturing to make their Death the more miserable, so delighting their Ears with the Cries and Shreeks of the poor dying Wretches: Yet the Spectators seem'd not satisfi'd by beholding onely the misery of these poor condemn'd Creatures.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How it is.</NOTE>The <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors <HI>Dioclesian</HI> and <HI>Maximinus</HI> began first to Rack the Cru∣cifi'd, which they perform'd in this manner: They held an Iron Anvil un∣der
<PB N="228" REF="146"/>their Legs and Arms, whilst another with a great Mallet broke their Bones all to pieces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Japanners</HI> Crucifie the <HI>Christians.</HI></NOTE>It is thought that the <HI>Heathens</HI> in antient times, and the <HI>Japanners</HI> under <HI>Daifu∣sama</HI>'s Government, chose that Death on purpose for the <HI>Christians,</HI> because they believed in a Crucifi'd <HI>Christ:</HI> Wherefore <HI>Daifusama</HI> also gave them charge to run them through the Sides with two long Spears, because our Saviour was transpierced. And whilst the <HI>Heathens</HI> sought thus to disgrace the <HI>Christians</HI> by Crucifying them, they took it as a great glory, dying the same Death as the Son of God had done for their Sins.</P>
<P>Concerning this kind of Punishment, and the Cross it self, several Authors have Written at large, especially <HI>Minutius Felix, Maximus Taurinensis, Tertullia∣nus,</HI> and others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Justin. Apol. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> I will out of all select onely two, <HI>viz. Justin Martyr,</HI> who says, <HI>View all things in the World, can they be Govern'd, or any ways us'd without the Sign of the Cross? The Earth is not Plough'd without it. The Diggers perform not their Labor, nor other Handicrafts, unless they have a Cross amongst their Tools or Instruments. Man differs no way in his shape from a Beast, onely that he is upright, and can spread his Arms into the form of a Cross.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hieronymus</HI> says,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hieronim. in Mar.</HI> c. 11.</NOTE> <HI>The fashion of a Cross represents the four corners of the World. The Birds when they flye in the Air take upon them the shape of a Cross. A Man Swim∣ming, or Praying, shews also like a Cross.</HI></P>
<P>It is also worthy our observation what <HI>Ruffinus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ruff.</HI> l. 2.2. c. 29. <HI>Sozom.</HI> l. 3. c. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Sozomenus,</HI> and <HI>Suidas</HI> have publish'd, namely, That in the time of the Emperor <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Great, the Idol Temples were all pull'd down.</P>
<P>In <HI>Egypt</HI> was also destroy'd an antient Temple, dedicated to the famous <HI>Se∣rapis:</HI> The Walls round about being pull'd to the Ground discover'd several Stones Engraven with strange Characters, which onely the Priests of <HI>Serapis</HI> could Read, many of which were made like a Cross, signifying the Life which was to come.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who first discover'd the <HI>Philippines.</HI></NOTE>¶ AT the time when <HI>Lodowick de Velasco,</HI> in the Name of <HI>Philip</HI> the Second King of <HI>Spain,</HI> bore the Chief Command over <HI>Mexico,</HI> he receiv'd Orders from <HI>Madrid, Anno</HI> 1564. to Rig out a great Fleet, and with them seek to discover some of those Islands that lay to the Southward of <HI>Japan,</HI> where formerly <HI>Ferdinand Magellanus</HI> first Landed, when he girdled the Universe, by Sailing round about it.</P>
<P>The Fleet set Sail from the Haven <HI>Nativitad,</HI> under the Command of <HI>Mi∣chael Lopez de Legaspi;</HI> who making his way through the <HI>South Sea,</HI> discover'd those Islands, which from <HI>Philip</HI> the Second are call'd <HI>Philippines;</HI> where setling himself in the City <HI>Manilla,</HI> he soon after built a great Church, and three Cloy∣sters; the first for the <HI>Augustine</HI> Monks, the second for the <HI>Franciscans,</HI> and the third for the <HI>Dominicans.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> possess'd these Islands quietly, till a Fleet from <HI>China</HI> gave them disturbance, and the first occcasion of War.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Ma∣nilla</HI> are set upon by a <HI>Chi∣nese</HI> Pyrate call'd <HI>Limahon.</HI></NOTE>One <HI>Limahon,</HI> born in a City of <HI>China,</HI> by name <HI>Trucheo,</HI> a Person of mean Extract, had a long while made the Seas dangerous; for in a short time a great Company of Pyrates and Robbers joyn'd with him, to the number of two thousand, with which he Ransack'd and Pillag'd all the adjoyning Countrey: Therefore the King of <HI>Cuytan</HI> rais'd all the Forces he could possible, to take <HI>Li∣mahon;</HI> but he having notice of it, retreated to a Sea-Port Town, not having a sufficient Army to encounter the Vice-Roys Forces.</P>
<P>At the same time the Harbour lay full of Ships, which his Men taking, and setting Sail with them, stood off to Sea; making all Prize whatever he met with: And being forty Sail, all well Mann'd, on a day he descry'd another <HI>Chinese</HI> Pyrate, call'd <HI>Vintoquiam,</HI> who had twenty Sail more than he; yet <HI>Lima∣hon</HI> resolv'd to set upon them, and had such good Success, that he conquer'd and made himself Master of fifty five Vessels more, <HI>Vintoquiam</HI> himself hardly escaping with five. Thus being encourag'd, he resolv'd to set upon all Sea-Port Towns and Villages; by which means, all <HI>China</HI> was in an Uproar, and in few days the Vice-Roy of <HI>Cuytan</HI> set out a hundred and thirty Vessels to Sea, Mann'd with forty thousand Seamen. <HI>Limahon</HI> having notice thereof, made Sail toward the desolate Isle <HI>Touzuacotican,</HI> to hide himself from the Navy, Conducted by the Knight <HI>Omoncon.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Limahon</HI>'s Actions.</NOTE>Whilst he lay lurking there, he seiz'd on two Ships, richly laden, and bound from <HI>Manilla</HI> to <HI>China:</HI> The Prisoners which he took gave him information, That there were not above seventy <HI>Spanish</HI> Soldiers in <HI>Manilla,</HI> the rest being imploy'd to discover the adjacent Isles; and how that the Countrey was fruit∣ful and populous, and the Inhabitants unprovided for War, neither were they us'd to be disturb'd by it. This News was very acceptable to him; where∣upon he steer'd his Course thither, and Sailing beyond the Islands <HI>Illocos,</HI> ran in sight of the New City <HI>Fernandina,</HI> built by <HI>John de Salzedo,</HI> and there fell upon a <HI>Spanish</HI> Galley freighted by <HI>Salzedo</HI> to fetch Provisions, which he set on fire, and without mercy put all the Men to the Sword. <HI>Salzedo</HI> affrighted by so great a Fleet, which steer'd directly towards <HI>Manilla,</HI> immediately sent thither fifty four <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to make resistance against the Enemy, and to give them at <HI>Manilla</HI> notice of the Invasion, to the end they might prepare all things in rea∣diness against their coming. But <HI>Limahon,</HI> who was forc'd to Victual at the nearest Islands, came after <HI>Salzedo,</HI> whose Fleet was stor'd with all manner of Provisions, arriv'd at <HI>Manilla</HI> in the Evening, on the last of <HI>October, Anno</HI> 1574.</P>

<P>And had the Wind blown any thing hard, that Night would have laid <HI>Ma∣nilla</HI> in Ashes, and drown'd the Inhabitants in their own Blood: For <HI>Limahon</HI> sent in the darkest part of the Night four hundred Men on Shore, which he commanded to spare neither Fire nor Sword: But the Sea going very hol∣low, they could not possibly Land till next Morning at eight of the Clock. About a League below the City they leap'd ashore, and march'd up along a plain Field in good order, with two hundred Musqueteers in the Front, and as many Pike-men in the Rere, towards the City <HI>Manilla.</HI> The Countrey Peo∣ple discovering them, brought the News to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> of which not one would believe it, every one thinking it onely to be an Uproar made on pur∣pose by the Natives.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Storms <HI>Manilla.</HI></NOTE>Mean time the <HI>Chineses</HI> came to the first House of the City, in which the Field-Marshal <HI>Martin Goyty</HI> had his Residence, which they fir'd, and slew him, with all his Family, except his Wife, which fled desparately wounded into the City. By her every one might see how the Business was; whereupon some Soldiers ran disorderly to encounter the Enemy, but being all slain in a short time, made the rest more wary, who marching up very orderly against the Enemy, forc'd them to retreat, and at last drove them back to their Ships.</P>
<P><HI>Limahon</HI> hearing this News, weigh'd Anchor, and Sail'd to the Haven <HI>Ca∣bita,</HI> two Leagues beyond <HI>Manilla.</HI> At this time <HI>Guido de Labassares</HI> was Gover∣nor of the <HI>Philippines,</HI> in the place of the Deceas'd <HI>Michael Lopez de Legaspy. La∣bassares</HI> saw no likelihood to keep off so great an Enemy with Pallisadoes, with which <HI>Manilla</HI> at that time was onely defended; and to fly from thence, would be too great a Reproach and Disgrace for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nobles: Therefore they thought it convenient to leave the City, and on a Hill not far off, with all speed to throw up a Platform:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spaniards</HI> raise For∣tifications.</NOTE> Two Days and Nights all those were imploy'd that were able, to finish the Work, ramming Poles into the Ground, against which they nail'd Planks, throwing Earth against them, and Barrels with Sand. Four Iron Guns (for so many they had in the City) were planted on a Point of the New Fortification. It so fortun'd, that <HI>Limahon</HI> made some stay in the Haven <HI>Cabita,</HI> whilst <HI>Salzedo</HI> brought fifty four <HI>Spaniards</HI> to <HI>Labassares</HI> Assistance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Limahon <HI>burns</HI> Manilla.</NOTE>The Fort was scarce finish'd, and <HI>Salzedo</HI> enter'd with his Men, when <HI>Li∣mahon</HI> dropp'd Anchor at break of Day before the City <HI>Manilla,</HI> and put six hundred Men on Shore, which ran into the City, and set the same on fire: That done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Storms their Fortifi∣cation.</NOTE> they march'd towards the new Fortification, where they met with so stout Resistance, that in short time two hundred of the <HI>Chineses</HI> were slain, and as many wounded;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is beaten off.</NOTE> where on the contrary, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> lost onely two Men, an Ensign call'd <HI>Sancio Ortiz,</HI> and another nam'd <HI>Francis de Leon.</HI></P>
<P>The Pyrates being thus roughly entertain'd, durst adventure no more; wherefore they Sail'd back to <HI>Cabita,</HI> and from thence forty Leagues up the great Stream <HI>Pangasinan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes to live near the River <HI>Pangasinan.</HI></NOTE> where he found a pleasant and fruitful Countrey, and a convenient place to hide himself from the <HI>Chinese</HI> Forces.

From hence he sent Ships abroad continually, which Cruising too and again about that Coast, let not one Vessel scape they met with, reporting, That he had utterly routed the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the <HI>Philippines.</HI></P>
<P>These Tidings, by many believ'd for Truth, caus'd no small Consideration in <HI>Labassares:</HI> For the Natives being kept in by the Valour of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> might upon this News break forth, and by their great numbers easily over∣power
<PB N="231" REF="147"/>and cut off a few, unless he re-establish'd their former Authority: Which to prevent, he judg'd it fit in open War to set upon the Pyrate: So gathering all their Forces and Vessels together, from the Islands <HI>Pintadoes</HI> and <HI>Philippines,</HI> they set forward.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Salzedo <HI>besieges</HI> Limahon.</NOTE>In the Fleet were two hundred and fifty <HI>Spanish</HI> Sea-men and Soldiers, and two thousand five hundred <HI>Indians,</HI> being all under the Command of <HI>Salzedo,</HI> who brought the Fleet about break of day, <HI>Anno</HI> 1575. the twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> into the River <HI>Pangasinan,</HI> the Mouth of which he block'd up with Vessels chain'd to one another, and put his Men ashore, with four great Guns.

<P>This Intelligence was very pleasing; whereupon immediately <HI>Gabriel de Ribera</HI> march'd by a private Way to <HI>Limahon</HI>'s Fort: The Commanders <HI>Peter de Chaves,</HI> and <HI>Laurence Chacon,</HI> Rowing with small and nimble Skiffs up the River, to the end they might also fall upon the Pyrate by Water, when <HI>Ribera</HI> set up∣on him at Land. <HI>Salzedo</HI> himself lay in Ambuscade, for a Reserve. <HI>Chaves</HI> and <HI>Chacon</HI> found <HI>Limahon</HI>'s Fleet unmann'd, at an Anchor under the Fort, which they presently fir'd, as also the Houses and Pallisadoes ashore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burns <HI>Limahon</HI>'s Fleet.</NOTE> and fell so fu∣riously upon the <HI>Chineses,</HI> that above a hundred of them were slain, and <HI>Lima∣hon</HI> escap'd very narrowly into the Castle.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Limahon</HI> fortifies himself.</NOTE>He having been busie all Night, had planted three great Guns, besides ma∣ny smaller, on his Bulwarks, and lin'd all his Curtains with Fire-arms; in∣somuch that <HI>Salzedo</HI> thought it dangerous Storming, but judg'd it fit to be∣siege the Fort at distance; and the rather, because most of <HI>Limahon</HI>'s Provisions, and other Necessaries, were burnt with the Ships, so that he could neither escape, nor hold out long.</P>
<P>Three Months <HI>Salzedo</HI> lay before the Castle, during which time the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships went to and again, from thence to <HI>Manilla</HI> for Provisions, and other Necessaries; when <HI>Michael de Loarcia</HI> saw just without the Haven <HI>Bulian</HI> a Vessel from <HI>Sangley,</HI> which he chac'd, and overtook: In the Ship hapned to be a <HI>Chi∣nese,</HI> call'd <HI>Sinsay,</HI> who had a long time drove a Trade in <HI>Manilla;</HI> he de∣sir'd them not to fire a Gun, before they did very well know what Vessel it was: Whereupon boarding one another, they inform'd <HI>Sinsay,</HI> That they had the <HI>Chinese</HI> Admiral <HI>Omoncon</HI> aboard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Chinese</HI> Admiral <HI>Omoncon</HI> comes to the <HI>Spa∣niards.</HI></NOTE> who had left his Fleet to inquire after <HI>Li∣mahon.</HI> The Admiral being then inform'd by them of the whole Business, went to <HI>Salzedo</HI>'s Army, whence having been courteously receiv'd, he departed for <HI>Manilla,</HI> (for it was judg'd that <HI>Limahon</HI> could not possibly escape) where he staid some time; but because the Business lasted longer than he expected, and so long absence from his Fleet might be inconvenient, he Sail'd thither, re∣solving in a short time to return, and fetch <HI>Limahon</HI> to <HI>China.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Omoncon</HI> reckon'd himself to be near <HI>China,</HI> by the depth of the Water, which about seventy Leagues from the Shore is eighty Fathom, and then grows shallower by degrees, as they approach the Coast, At last he discover'd the stately City <HI>Tutuhul,</HI> beautiful to the Eye, by reason of its many Towers and magnificent Buildings, lying in the Territory <HI>Chinchy.</HI> At the Mouth of an Inlet stood a Sentinel, on a high Rock, who gave sudden notice to seven Ships, that lay at an Anchor behind a Promontory, that he discry'd a Sail afar off at Sea: Whereupon weighing with all speed, they chas'd <HI>Omoncon,</HI> who bore up to <HI>Tutuhul;</HI> and though he was commanded by several Guns to strike, yet he went on, and regarded them not. The Governor himself was gotten into a nimble Skiff with Oars, which <HI>Omoncon</HI> fetch'd up by degrees; and they per∣ceiving the Colours, took in their Sails, and lay by to receive the Governor, whom <HI>Omoncon</HI> courteously entertain'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Omoncon</HI> courteously re∣ceiv'd.</NOTE> and proceeded on his Voyage to <HI>Tansu∣sa,</HI> a pleasant and strong City, fortified with Walls.</P>
<P>Here, betwixt firing of Guns and Musquets, he put the <HI>Augustine</HI> Monks ashore, having had free leave and permittance from the Governor of <HI>Tansusa;</HI> to which purpose, according to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Custom, a small white varnish'd Board was brought him from the Governor, sign'd with his own Hand; the Letters which were written upon it were these, <HI>Permit the Strangers to Land freely.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are forc'd to go from <HI>China.</HI></NOTE>But after the viewing of several <HI>Chinese</HI> Towns, and other Curiosities, they were commanded to depart, the <HI>Chineses</HI> suspecting, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having Plantations in most Countreys, were come over purposely to make an Inspe∣ction there. This Jealousie began to increase the more, because the Rumor was, That <HI>Limahon</HI> (who was said to be block'd up in the River <HI>Pangasinan,</HI> that it was impossible for him to escape) destroy'd and ransack'd all along the Sea-coast, and had there ruin'd and pull'd a City down to the Ground. It is certain, that <HI>Limahon</HI> had prepar'd some small Vessels in his Castle, and in a dark Night made his escape between <HI>Salzedo</HI>'s Watch: Yet he was falsly accus'd concerning his Pyracy; for <HI>Toacay,</HI> a Friend to the other noted Pyrate <HI>Vinto∣quiam,</HI> and <HI>Limahon</HI>'s Enemy, had and did still invade the Coasts of <HI>Chinchy.</HI></P>
<P>¶ MEan while the Grand Council of <HI>Chinchy</HI> assembled together, before whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> appear'd, to give an Account for their coming to <HI>China;</HI> who reply'd so well, and gave them such Reasons, that having before been kept close Prisoners, they obtain'd Liberty.</P>
<P>It being then New-Moon, at which time all the Soldiers in <HI>China</HI> must ap∣pear in their Arms, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had leave to go out of the City, to the Field

Here, like Skirmish∣ing, they fired at one another with Powder; then falling in, they endeavor'd to break their Ranks, and defeat the whole Army; the Pike-men fiercely en∣countering one another, sending their broken Pikes in pieces into the Air, to testifie their Masters Strength. Those that were not expert in Exercising, were soundly beaten by their Commanders, that by such severe Correction they might learn to do better. Four Hours were spent in training them up in their Martial Discipline; of which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gave Testimony, That the like Exercise and Soldiers were not to be found in any Countrey in the World besides.</P>

Those at Land also were not free from danger, the Wind blowing up great Trees by the Roots, casting down pieces of old Walls, shaking the Houses and Temples, and tumbling them down on a sudden: In the Streets the Houses often falling down one against another, slew those which stood there for shelter. Several in the Countrey were lifted up from the ground, and carried a good distance from the Place whereon they stood. The Sea also rag'd with impetuous Billows, that clogging the Rivers with the Surges, the Water finding no vent, overflow'd the Banks, so drowning the adjacent Countreys.

<P>In another Letter <HI>Xaverius</HI> writes thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Xaver.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Christian</HI> Religion hath but small success a∣mongst the <HI>Japanners▪ Tursell. in vita Xaverii.</HI></NOTE>Yet for all this, the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion went on but slowly; partly because <HI>Angar,</HI> according to <HI>Tursellinus,</HI> could not well describe the Articles of the <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Faith in the <HI>Japan</HI> Tongue, and withal writ so badly, that the <HI>Japanners</HI> could not make any sense thereof; and also the <HI>Japan</HI> Tongue being exceeding difficult, <HI>Xaverius</HI> could not easily learn the same: Yet in <HI>Cangoxima</HI> were those that affected <HI>Christianity,</HI> insomuch that there was some hopes of a few that would embrace the same; but this soon vanish'd. The King of this Coun∣trey had kept <HI>Xaverius</HI> a considerable time, and permitted him to Preach the Doctrine of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and Baptize those that believ'd therein; which he did, not that he was any way concern'd for the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> but because he was inform'd, that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Merchants Ships brought very rich and costly Commodities from <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Goa,</HI> which might prove very advantageous to <HI>Cangoxima,</HI> if they came thither. But because the <HI>Portugals</HI> in the interim came constantly to an Anchor at <HI>Firando,</HI> the King of <HI>Cangoxima</HI> was much displeas'd,
<PB N="238" REF="151"/>and chiefly had a bad opinion of <HI>Xaverius,</HI> because that he being of great esteem amongst the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> could easily perswade them to remove their Sta∣ple or Factory to <HI>Cangoxima.</HI> The <HI>Bonzies</HI> watching for such an Opportunity, stirr'd up the displeas'd King the more, because <HI>Xaverius</HI> had spoil'd their Hea∣thenish Doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Cangoxima</HI> is enrag'd against the <HI>Chri∣stians.</HI></NOTE> and declar'd their abominable and wicked Lives. Whilst thus the Progress or the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith was stopp'd, there was publish'd an Edict, That none should Apostatize from their Fore-fathers Religion, which was establish'd in the Empire of <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Xaverius</HI> observing, that no good was to be done, parting from thence, went to <HI>Firando,</HI> where he converted about a hundred Persons, which he per∣form'd in this manner: First reading to them the Grounds of the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith concerning the <HI>Trinity,</HI> and of our Savior <HI>Christ,</HI> and that by his means we must be all sav'd. <HI>Angar</HI> had translated these Articles out of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Tongue, into the <HI>Japan</HI> Language; but not without great Mistakes.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why he put himself in rich Apparel.</NOTE>Mean while <HI>Xaverius,</HI> observing that the <HI>Japanners</HI> valu'd a Man according to the Richness or Meanness of his Habit, having hitherto gone in poor Ap∣parel, found that he was little or not at all regarded; therefore resolv'd to put on a rich and stately Coat, that so he might be better regarded, and because the <HI>Japanners</HI> out of Curiosity would look upon him the more: And indeed it prov'd so; for teaching therewith in the Streets, he had a far greater Con∣gregation than formerly: Then the People began private Disputations amongst themselves, concerning that Religion; and chiefly the <HI>Bonzi</HI> were at variance amongst themselves, concerning the Articles of the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith.</P>

<P>¶ BUt besides the Province of <HI>Bungo,</HI> several others have embrac'd the Chri∣stian Religion, which happen'd thus: When <HI>Xaverius, Anno</HI> 1551. in <HI>No∣vember,</HI> travel'd from <HI>Japan</HI> to <HI>Goa,</HI> he took with him two Christian <HI>Japanners, Mattheus</HI> and <HI>Bernard,</HI> which were sent to salute his Holiness in <HI>Rome;</HI> But <HI>Mattheus</HI> dying at <HI>Goa, Bernard us</HI> proceeded in his Journey alone, and was the first of the <HI>Japanners</HI> that kiss'd his Holiness Feet: He in his return home-ward, dy'd at <HI>Conimbrica</HI> in <HI>Spain. Xaverius</HI> himself travel'd to <HI>China,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Xaverius</HI> leaves the Je∣suits in <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE> there to Preach the Gospel, for the <HI>Japanners</HI> cry'd continually, that the <HI>Chineses,</HI> from whom the <HI>Japan</HI> Religion was Extracted, did not imbrace the Christian Faith.</P>
<P>There stay'd behind in <HI>Japan, Cosmus Turrianus,</HI> and <HI>Joannes Fernandez;</HI> be∣sides two <HI>Japan</HI> Converts, being <HI>Paul of the Holy Belief,</HI> and <HI>Lawrence One-Eye;</HI> by whose extraordinary diligence, the Christian Religion was imbrac'd by many of the Commonalty (the <HI>Jesuits</HI> teaching them the Commandments, and the Gospel of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and the Holy Trinity) in <HI>Cangoxima,
<PB N="242" REF="153"/>Firando, Amangucium,</HI> and <HI>Bungo. Xaverius</HI> a little before his death, sent from <HI>Goa</HI> to <HI>Japan, Balthazar Gago, Edward Sylvius,</HI> and <HI>Peter Alcacova;</HI> after that went over thither, also <HI>Casper Vilela, Lodowick Almeida, Gonsalves Fernandes, Franciscus Capria∣lis, Lodowick Frojus, Joannes Baptista Montanus, Organtinus Brixiensis, Peter Diasius, Arias Blandonius, Arias Sanctius, Duartes a Sylva, Melchior Mugaez, Franciscus Perezi∣us,</HI> and others. These effected so much in few years, that Christianity began now to increase wonderfully, and as an effect of their Zeal, they built several Towns, Cloysters, and Churches, being every where highly respected, and much esteem'd: These successful Progresses gave hopes of a happy Event, espe∣cially, for that now <HI>Cosmus Turrianus,</HI> and <HI>Edward Sylvius,</HI> besides many Citizens in <HI>Amangucium,</HI> Converted two <HI>Bonzies</HI> of <HI>Meaco;</HI> and indeed, Christianity so prevail'd both in strength and number, that the Rusticks near <HI>Amangucium</HI> be∣gan to dispute with the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> of which, some falling short in the Arguments of their Religion, were forc'd to flie for shame.</P>
<P>Not long after, <HI>Turrianus</HI> built a great Church in the City, intending there to perform in publick all Divine Services; Some of the Courtiers were by this time also become Proselites; and amongst the rest, the King's Treasurer <HI>Am∣brosius Eunadus Faisumius,</HI> who soon after Dying, was Inter'd in the following manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edvard. Sylv Epist Bungo <HI>1555.</HI></NOTE> Besides the Jesuit <HI>Edward Sylvius,</HI> above two hundred young Christi∣ans went to his Burial; a great Cross was carry'd before the Corps, and a considerable number of Torches round about, which turn'd the day into night, not without great admiration of the Inhabitants, by whom the Funeral Solemnities were perform'd quite contrary. <HI>Fasumius</HI> his Widow feasted the Poor four days together after the Funeral,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Almshouse in <HI>Fu∣naco.</HI></NOTE> distributing much Houshold-stuff, and many Clothes among them. Moreover, <HI>Turrianus</HI> built a double Alms∣house, or Hospital in the City <HI>Funaco;</HI> one side being for those that had the Le∣prosie, which came flocking thither from all parts of <HI>Japan</HI> (that Countrey being very subject to that distemper) the second partition was for other sickly Persons; over both these, <HI>Turrianus</HI> made a <HI>Japan</HI> Christian Master, one that was experienc'd in Physick.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Japanners</HI> kept their Feasts.</NOTE>¶ THe Province of <HI>Amangucium,</HI> was beyond all other Dominions, full of Christians, because the King embrac'd that Faith, and promoted the same; the People upon Festival days, flock'd to the Temples in great num∣bers, where the <HI>Jesuits</HI> represented the Sufferings of our Savior, hanging a large Vane on the top of the Church, with a Crucifi'd Man in the middle; which done, all the lights were quite put out, and every one having stor'd themselves with Whips and Scourges, disrobed the upper part of their bodies, and Disciplin'd themselves so long, till the fiftieth <HI>Psalm</HI> was read out. On <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Also</HI> Palm-Sunday.</NOTE> they distributed Consecrated Branches, and went in Procession, having a great Cross carry'd before them, locking the Church-doors round about; without stood a <HI>Jesuit,</HI> holding a Cross in his hands, saying aloud, <HI>Open, O ye Eternal Gates;</HI> whereupon those within answer'd, <HI>Who is the King of Honor?</HI> At last, walking two by two into the Temple towards the Altar, a <HI>Jesuit</HI> Cele∣brated Mass.</P>
<P>At other times they walk'd about the Churches with Torches,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Casp. Vilela Epist. Eirando</HI> 1557.</NOTE> when hiding a Man in a Grave, they plac'd two Arm'd <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and two Youths with Helmets on to Guard the same; then the Man arose out of the Grave, so representing the Resurrection of Christ. In the middle of the Church stood the great Altar, on both sides of it were built several Chappels, all hung with stately Pictures and
<PB N="243" REF="153"/>rich Tapistry, shewing the Crucifying on <HI>Golgotha,</HI> the Resurrection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several representations in <HI>Japan,</HI> to establish the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Religion.</NOTE> and As∣cention from <HI>Mount Olivet;</HI> round about the Walls were plac'd a great number of Wax-Candles; before the Altar, in the corner of the Chappel, hung a black Cloth, behind which stood a <HI>Jesuit,</HI> in the Habit of a Priest.</P>
<P>Nine times they sung <HI>Kyrieeleyson;</HI> which done, the Cloth was suddenly drawn aside, and there appear'd on the Altar the Cross, and other Images, with many Ornaments, then also the <HI>Jesuit</HI> came in open view, whereupon the Bells Were rung; then their Singers, with Garlands about their Heads, and lighted Torches in their Hands follow'd the Host, who was carry'd through the Church under a rich Canopy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Province and City <HI>Amangucium</HI> suffer many inconveniencies.</NOTE>This manner of Worship the <HI>Japanners</HI> were mightily taken withal, and chiefly in the Province <HI>Amangucium,</HI> where the Catholick Religion was no way less exercis'd, than in the middle of <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Italy;</HI> notwithstanding the City <HI>Amangucium</HI> had suffer'd much for it, being in the space of five years twice pull'd down to the ground, and was scarce Re-built, when <HI>Anno</HI> 1557. the <HI>Drossaert Mo∣ridono</HI> laid the whole City the third time in Ashes: the King with all the Chri∣stian Nobility and Souldiers, flying to a Castle five Leagues from <HI>Amangucium,</HI> was slain there with all his Retinue.</P>
<P>¶ IN other places the <HI>Jesuits</HI> enjoy'd themselves in Peace and quietness, and receiv'd yearly Revenues of the Lords of the Countreys, for the promo∣ting and teaching their Doctrine.

<P>The King of <HI>Vocoajura</HI> proffer'd them a piece of ground, twenty Miles in circumference, where no heathen <HI>Japanners,</HI> but onely Christians were per∣mitted to live.

Far less trouble did the King of <HI>Arima</HI> find, when besides those of <HI>Bungo</HI> and <HI>Omura</HI> he al∣so embrac'd the Christian Religion.</P>
<P>Those were the three Kings, which <HI>Anno</HI> 1582. sent to his Holiness at <HI>Rome,</HI> the Ambassadors, <HI>Munico Ito, Michael Cinga, Julianus Nacaura,</HI> and <HI>Martinus Fara,</HI> as we have already related at large.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Japan</HI> Ambassadors which went to <HI>Rome,</HI> prov'd very beneficial to the Jesu∣its.</NOTE>¶ COncerning the return of these <HI>Japanners, Linschot</HI> saith thus: <Q>The <HI>Ja∣panners</HI> went to Sail from the Haven of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> in the Ship St. <HI>Philip,</HI> (which in its return home, was taken by the <HI>English</HI> Admiral <HI>Drake,</HI> and was the first Ship that was lost in the <HI>East-India</HI> Expedition; about which were several opinions at that time, because the Ship was by the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Name) and whilst I was at <HI>Goa,</HI> they came thither Cloth'd in Cloth of Silver and Gold, in a most costly manner, after the <HI>Italian</HI> fashion, and were receiv'd with great joy by the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> who had finish'd that their great Design; to that purpose, Publishing a Book in <HI>Spanish,</HI> containing the Voy∣age and Travels of the <HI>Japanners,</HI> as well by Water as by Land, and their se∣veral Receptions by the <HI>European</HI> Princes. Going from <HI>Goa</HI> to <HI>Japan,</HI> they oc∣casion'd no small admiration in their Countreymen; the <HI>Jesuits</HI> desir'd this (as they pretended) for two several Reasons: First, To make the <HI>Japanners</HI> the willinger to embrace the Christian Faith, and also, that they might be
<PB N="245" REF="154"/>Eye-witnesses of the glorious and excellent Cities, which none could possi∣bly perswade them to believe: But indeed, the chief reason was to make their Order famous, and also to get a Mass of Treasure thereby; for they kept most of the Presents that were given to the <HI>Japan</HI> Princes for themselves, and they obtain'd likewise an Order from the <HI>Pope,</HI> and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> that no <HI>Portugal,</HI> nor any other Christian, might settle in <HI>Japan</HI> without their License; so that the <HI>Jesuits</HI> turn'd out other Friers, keeping onely a few Priests and <HI>Portugal</HI> Artificers, without which they could not possible be. To others, of what Estate or Degree soever, their admission into the Coun∣trey was on this <HI>Proviso,</HI> That as soon as ever their business was finish'd, they should depart; but if they were minded to stay longer, they should buy that liberty for Money of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> for they were most Eminent and Powerful in all places of <HI>Japan,</HI> where the Doctrine of Christ was Preached. They make the <HI>Japanners</HI> believe what they list; they are honor'd by them like gods and Saints: They also obtain'd leave of the <HI>Pope,</HI> that they might out of their Order chose a Bishop over <HI>Japan,</HI> notwithstanding it is against the Law of their Order; He that was sent to perform this Office, was coming from <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> but dying by the way, another was Elected in his place; in short, the <HI>Jesuits</HI> endeavor to get all things here under their Command.</Q> Thus far <HI>Linschot.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner how the Je∣suits spread the Christian Religion in <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE>¶ IT is also worthy our Observation, how the <HI>Jesuits</HI> spread the Catholick Religion over most part of <HI>Japan: Xaverius</HI> began first, telling them of the Creation of the World, and how God had Created all things, and that the Son of God, in the fulness of time, had taken upon him Mans Nature, and Dy'd on the Cross, was Bury'd, rose again, and Ascended up to Heaven, from whence he will come to Judge the Quick and the Dead. This Doctrine Translated out of <HI>Portugal</HI> in the <HI>Japan</HI> Tongue, <HI>Xaverius</HI> read the easier to the <HI>Japanners,</HI> because it was written in <HI>Portugal</HI> Characters.</P>
<P><HI>Cosmus Turianus,</HI> and <HI>Joannes Ferdinandez</HI> Preach'd most of the Miracles which Christ wrought, and taught the Auditors to make Crosses with the right-hand, and to begin at the Head, <HI>In the Name of the Father;</HI> and so Sign themselves down to the Breast, <HI>In the Name of the Son;</HI> and then from the left shoulder to the right, <HI>In the Name of the Holy Ghost:</HI> They also instructed them to Pray on Gar∣lands of Roses, telling them over knob by knob, and saying, <HI>Jesus Maria.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange way how the <HI>Japanners</HI> became Chri∣stians.</NOTE><HI>Paul</HI> of the <HI>Holy Belief</HI> us'd a Picture, representing the Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and the Child <HI>Jesus</HI> sitting in her Lap, which he held before the King <HI>Cangoxima,</HI> to the end, to make him loathe the <HI>Heathenish</HI> Idolatry.

<P>¶ THe Italian <HI>Joannes Baptista Montanus,</HI> relates in a Letter written from <HI>Bungo, Anno</HI> 1564. <Q>That when he set foot on <HI>Japan,</HI> being sent thi∣ther by <HI>Cosmus Turrianus</HI> to the King of <HI>Bungo,</HI> who had above a year and a half desir'd to have a Priest, he was courteously receiv'd by him; yet the King remain'd still amongst the Sect of the <HI>Bonzies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">None taught the <HI>Japan∣ners</HI> better than the Jesuit <HI>Montanus.</HI></NOTE> which deny'd the Mor∣tality of the Soul, but shew'd a great respect to all Christians.</Q> Moreover <HI>Mon∣tanus</HI> relates, what course he took in Converting the <HI>Japanners</HI> in <HI>Bungo:</HI><Q>First, He contradicted with strong Arguments the <HI>Japan</HI> Religion, shewing them,
<PB N="246" REF="155"/>that it was impossible to attain Salvation thereby:</Q> When they understood this, then he told them, <Q>That one God had Created all things of nothing, and made Men according to his own Image, to govern all: But the wicked that run headlong and wilfully to the Devil, had no share therein; and that our Sins had brought Death upon us; and how Men were still inclin'd to wickedness, acting against the Laws of God and Man, nay, against God himself; and since our Sins provok'd so Omnipotent a God, they deserv'd Everlasting Punishment: But the second Person of the Holy Trinity had taken upon him Mans Nature in the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> to the end, he might in Mans Nature (which could onely suffer) die for our Sins a most cruel Death, and by reason of his God-head, prepar'd for us after this transitory Life, an Everlasting Being, where there is the fulness of all Joys.</Q> Then he explain'd them the Laws, Customs, and Mysteries of Baptism, and at last, answer'd the <HI>Bonzies</HI> to their several Contradictions, which they made against the Chri∣stian Religion.</P>

<PB N="248" REF="156"/>die as many times? are those which brought us into the world tormented by Diabolical Fiends, without any cessation? cannot God help them? how can it then be possible, that he is Omnipotent? or will he not help them? how is it then that he is merciful? and what enjoyment can Heaven be to us, if we should be transported thither through death, having so many Re∣lations, Children, Fathers and Mothers, who weep and roar continually for their insufferable torments? And what Reasons can there be given, that the merciful Creator should take delight in punishing everlastingly the poor Creature?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Xaverius</HI> tells us, That he convinc'd and resolv'd them on all their Argu∣ments and Demands, but gives us no account with what Reasons he satisfi'd them; onely he relates, that he shed abundance of Tears when he spake of the damn'd condition of the deceased <HI>Japanners.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, when <HI>Xaverius</HI> told them, That there was a beginning of all things: they immediately reply'd, <Q>That that beginning must be either good or evil, and did God create both good and bad at once? How can he be God, and confine all good in himself, and be the onely occasion of all good out of himself? If he be good, from whence are these bad Devils? Did God create them bad? where then is his abundant goodness? Or did he give over those to evil, which he could have kept from it? Was Man created to serve God in holiness? why doth he suffer the Devil to tempt him to wick∣edness? Why is Man left to himself, that cannot subsist without the Spirit of God? How can it also agree with Gods goodness, to create Men unable by their weakness, to be condemn'd for their sins, and by their damnation for ever miserable? And why are there such Laws ordain'd, that no Creature on Earth is able to perform, the least breach of which is eternal damnation? insomuch that upon necessity the whole Race of Mankind, by the power of that Law, must be cursed, he being born in sin. The <HI>Japan</HI> Religion was establish'd on better grounds of Gods Mercy, in that they had no everlasting Hell. The Worshippers and Servants of <HI>Amida, Xaca, Canon,</HI> and other <HI>Japan</HI> gods, exchanged by death their transitory Life for everlasting Salvation: and if it happen'd that after death they suffer'd some torments for their sins committed in this Life, that continu'd but a short time, according to the Crime.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments of those <HI>Ja∣panners</HI> that intended to be <HI>Christians.</HI></NOTE>These were generally the controverted Questions which <HI>Xaverius</HI> was to answer: but after these arose a new stop in the way. The <HI>Japanners,</HI> who by this time gave some ear to the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> could no ways understand why God did make himself known to none but those Strangers which came thither from <HI>Portugal?</HI> they told them, That their Forefathers liv'd very retir'd; but those which for Theft, Adultery, Murder, or neglect of the <HI>Japan</HI> Religion, as it was taught them from time to time, could not be admonish'd in their Life∣times, must they according to the <HI>Japan Christian Faith</HI> be therefore tortur'd in everlasting Flames? who must bear the blame of that spoil?

Moreover, they demanded of what Shape and Colour the Soul was? What manner of Creatures the Devils were? Why they tempted Men to sin, and chiefly aim'd at his destruction? How they came to be so wicked, since God created all things good? They enquir'd what God was, and where? If he could not be seen? Why he had block'd up the way to Heaven with so many troubles, where good∣ness onely resides?</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bonzies</HI> curse the <HI>Jesuits.</HI></NOTE>Mean while the <HI>Bonzies</HI> spent their time continually in their Temples and Cloysters, in railing against the <HI>Jesuits:</HI> They Preach'd publickly before the People, That the <HI>Christians</HI> were Cannibals, or Men-eaters; That the Devil had spoken from a Brazen Image, prognosticating that <HI>Amangucium</HI> should in a short time be utterly destroy'd for their wickedness, in embracing the <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Religion. Not long after they say, that themselves saw in the Night a of Fire descending from Heaven on the Palace of <HI>Amangucium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Terrible Fire.</NOTE> which sud∣denly burning, made their foretelling true; for the City burnt eight days to∣gether, and then Murder and Cruelties spared neither young nor old, not so much as the poor Infants, which were Sucking at their Mothers Breasts. Those which sought not to escape by flight, died a most miserable death: whereupon the general Cry of the <HI>Bonzies</HI> was, That the unknown God of the <HI>Christians</HI> must be a most horrible Monster, by whose Religion, if it took foot∣ing in their Countrey, <HI>Japan</HI> would be utterly destroy'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reason why the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Religion went on so prosperously in <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE>Notwithstanding these grand oppositions, yet there is no Countrey, either West, North, or South, that hath been discover'd by Navigation, which hath taken so large an impression of the true Faith, as <HI>Japan:</HI> notwithstanding the Blood-Baths which were made there, the cruel Persecutions, the barbarousness of their Tortures, the meekness of the Sufferers, the infinite numbers of Miseries which happen'd in so short a time, that can scarcely be paralell'd by any other People in the World: for which cause we will relate the way by which the <HI>Christians</HI> in <HI>Japan</HI> went on so successfully.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Reason why the <HI>Jesuits</HI> spoke for the Poor.</NOTE>The <HI>Jesuits</HI> soon after their arrival were much frequented by the poorer sort of People, which are very numerous in <HI>Japan,</HI> the Countrey being so exceeding populous, that they seem to undo one another, the Nobles living on the gain of their Subjects, who bring them in so much, that they scarce know their own Revenue, whilst the meaner sort undergo extreme Poverty; and the more, be∣cause Compassion is banish'd from the Countrey, and nothing less found there than Charity to the Poor, The <HI>Jesuits</HI> Preach'd against their hard-heartedness, teaching them, That the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion requir'd bountiful hearts towards the Poor, that Men should have compassion of one anothers miseries; he de∣serv'd to be forsaken in his misery, which will not act for his Neighbors re∣lief: what is it that can happen to one, but it may happen to another? who will forget a poor Man, that is himself subject to all frailties? This Doctrine the poor <HI>Japanners</HI> embraced the more willingly, because it pleaded for their po∣verty; but yet it took a deeper impression when the action it self follow'd: for when the <HI>Jesuits</HI> had gotten some of the Princes to embrace their Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Build Alms-houses.</NOTE> which allow'd them great Revenues, they immediately built Alms-houses, dividing them into two several Apartments; in one of which those that were infected with the Leprosie had their Lodgings, and in the other those that had other Sicknesses: great multitudes came flocking thither, and at the entring of the Alms-house received Baptism. Thus the <HI>Jesuits</HI> numbers increased dai∣ly
<PB N="250" REF="157"/>to their great Cost and Charge, none but poor and needy People coming to them out of necessity, were Baptized. The Letters may be seen wherein they make heavy complaints, that the <HI>Japan Christians</HI> consisted most in diseased and decrepid poor People, which were Converted onely to be Maintain'd by them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bonzies</HI> are cruel to the Poor.</NOTE> And these came the more because the <HI>Bonzies</HI> never regarded them, neither bestowing Alms, nor taking care of their Burial, or to provide such things as their Religion requires after death, to the end they may live in joy and happi∣ness with their gods <HI>Amida</HI> and <HI>Xaca.</HI> But it is no marvel why the <HI>Bonzies</HI> neg∣lect the Poor, and bestow their labor for the Rich, when we consider their self-endedness; and therefore they are so carless, because they leave nothing behind them for the <HI>Bonzies.</HI> It was also very pleasing to the poor <HI>Japanners,</HI> when the <HI>Jesuits</HI> told them the way to heaven was much more troublesom for the Rich to pass than the Poor, and how that earthly Treasures were as Weights and Clogs to hold Mens Souls from getting into Heaven; and those that found not Riches in this World, should obtain and enjoy the more in the World to come.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Covetousness of Prin∣ces the second Reason.</NOTE>Besides these winnings upon the Poor, Covetousness induced and won up∣on the Princes, whose Dominions border'd the Sea: for the <HI>Portuguese</HI> sending several Vessels richly Laden from <HI>Goa, Malacca,</HI> the <HI>Philippines, Macaw,</HI> and other Places, to <HI>Japan,</HI> great benefit did those Territories reap where these Ships came to an Anchor. The Kings of <HI>Bungo, Arima, Cangoxima, Amangucium,</HI> and <HI>Firando,</HI> had the most convenient Havens; and every one of these sought to be∣reave another, and ingross the Trade to themselves; which they could not do without the <HI>Jesuits:</HI> for who ever got them for their Friends, might command the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vessels where they pleas'd, the Commanders not daring to Un∣lade but by their directions: for which cause the <HI>Jesuits</HI> always against the time of their Countrey-mens coming went to Sea, to meet with the Ships, so to order them to Anchor in such a Princes Haven, whose Favor they wanted for the promoting of the <HI>Catholick Belief.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lodowick Frojus</HI> relates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. Eroj. Firand. <HI>1564.</HI></NOTE> That he was forbid to Preach in <HI>Firando,</HI> notwith∣standing the King seem'd to have some inclination to become a Convert. I will set down something which this Place requires, of <HI>Frojus</HI> his Letter. <HI>In the interim,</HI> says he, <HI>two</HI> Portuguese <HI>Vessels were seen to steer hither, whose Commanders durst not come into the Haven of</HI> Firando <HI>without my Orders and Licence, which the King observing, and instigated with the hopes of Profit, excus'd himself, that he had not Enter∣tain'd and Complemented me before that time; and withall earnestly entreated me, that I would not forbid the</HI> Portuguese <HI>from coming to an Anchor at</HI> Firando: <HI>for which Courtesie he would in few days give order for me to have the same Priviledge in Preaching as heretofore: Whereupon the</HI> Portuguese <HI>upon my permittance came into the Harbor, and to the King, asking him if he would fulfill his Promise, to let them at their own Charge re-build the Church which he had pull'd down? But the King endeavor'd by putting us off to gain time, and at last deceiv'd us. At this time the Ship call'd</HI> The Holy Cross <HI>ap∣pear'd on the Coast; I my self being at Sea discover'd her first, and going Aboard perswaded the Commander,</HI> Peter Almaida, <HI>to drop Anchor in the Road a League and a half from</HI> Firando: <HI>soon after</HI> Almaida <HI>himself came on Shore, and threatned the King, that he would depart with his Ship from thence, and Sail to some other Port, if he did not perform his Promises to me. The King desired some days to consider; but at last being fearful if he should delay the time any longer, that</HI> Almaida <HI>would weigh Anchor and go to another Port, which would be to his great damage, he granted me free leave to come again to</HI> Firan∣do, <HI>and re-build the Temple.</HI></P>
<PB N="251" REF="157"/>
<P>The like footing the <HI>Jesuits</HI> had in other Kingdoms; where they obtain'd liberty of the Princes to Preach, upon condition to cause the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Trade to be brought thither.</P>
<P>This was the Reason for which the King of <HI>Cangoxima</HI> gave free leave to the <HI>Jesuits</HI> to instruct the Natives in <HI>Christianity,</HI> and to build Churches and Cloysters for the same purpose. But afterward being inform'd, that two <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> Vessels were gone to Unlade in the Haven of <HI>Firando,</HI> he forbad the <HI>Je∣suits</HI> from any farther proceeding, he laying all the fault on them, they having the sole Command of the Ships, to cause them to Unlade in what Harbor they please.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Reason why the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion met with such good success in <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE>Besides these two former, there is a third Reason why the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> took so soon footing in <HI>Japan,</HI> which was the ignorance of the <HI>Japanners</HI> in Natural Philosophy; for which cause they were much amazed when the <HI>Jesuits</HI> told them concerning the Weather, and all sorts of Meteors; How that the Fire which was either kindled in the Air, or Crevises of the Earth, made horrible Representations; That the Air, or Region under the Moon produced flying Sparks, flaming Torches, burning Lamps, and falling Stars; That in the Harvest-time, when the Earth is neither Frozen by extremity of Cold, nor dry'd up by excess of Heat, abundance of Vapors arise, which cause those <HI>Ignes fatui,</HI> or as the Vulgar call it, <HI>Jack with a Lantern.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Jesuits</HI> teach them Philosophy to their great admiration.</NOTE> They declared also the Generation and significations of Comets, that when they appear'd bloody, duskish, or bright, with a long Tail, they either signifi'd Drought, excess of Heat, Storms, Earthquakes, Famine, or Deluges. And likewise they decla∣red the occasion of Thunder and Lightning: whereof some being inclos'd in the Clouds, doth rattle and make a noise onely; other breaks forth, battering all that they meet with, or set it on fire; and that in the Night it Lightned more frequently than in the Day-time, and chiefly in the heat of Summer. They told them the reason of the appearing of Rain-bowes, whether they pro∣ceed from the Sun or Moon, and though commonly appearing after Rain, yet must be look'd upon as a Divine Token, that God will no more destroy the whole World in a general Deluge. Moreover, they shew'd the reason of the opening of the Skie, and Circles about the Moon; That white Clouds, and also red in the Evening, were signs of fair Weather, but in the Morning foreshew'd Storms, and abundance of Rain; That the Clouds, which were the Receptacles of Thunder, bred Rain; and besides Water, also sometimes sent down, to the admiration of Men, Milk, Blood, Frogs, Stones, and such like. They also taught, That Snow was a thin Cloud, which in the falling Freezeth into that Nature as it comes upon the Earth; That Hail detaining some warmth, is sooner subject to Cold; but the higher it Congeals and Freezes in the Air, the smaller it is, and the lower the bigger, and chiefly in the Summer-time, because of the great difference betwixt Cold and Heat. They inform'd them with the occasions of Dew, Mists, Fogs, and Ice; That a timely Thaw and Mizling Rain brought great Profit; That the Heat in Winter, remaining in the Caverns of the Earth, preserved all manner of Roots, and that the Dew in the Summer moistens the Ground, and nourishes the Plants; whereas otherwise the Sun would scorch the Grass and other Products, and untimely Frosts kill the early Buds. They also instructed them, That the Fountains and Rivers had their original from the Sea, and passing through the Caverns of the Earth, lost their saltness; unfolding to them also many My∣steries of the depths and shallowness of Waters, and the ebbing and flowing of
<PB N="252" REF="158"/>the Ocean. But especially they discoursed at large of Earthquakes, be∣cause they frequently infest <HI>Japan,</HI> sometimes shaking it like a Skiff toss'd by the Waves; at other times lifting it up and down, and swallowing whole Vil∣lages, Towns, Cities, nay, great Tracts of Land, leaving in their steads unfa∣thomable Pits; all which wrought strange effects in the <HI>Japanners.</HI> But they were much more concern'd, even to admiration, when the <HI>Jesuits</HI> told them be∣fore-hand the Moneth, Week, Day, Hour, and Minute, when the Sun or Moon would be Ecclypsed; the first by the Moons passing before the Sun; the second by the interposition of the Terrestrial Globe betwixt the Sun and Moon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> are desirous of Learning.</NOTE>These Discourses concerning; Lightning, Thunder, Clouds, Rain, Hail, Fountains, Floods, and other natural Motions and Meteors, delighted the <HI>Ja∣panners</HI> the more, because they are much addicted to learn knowledge of Myste∣ries. <HI>Johannes Fernandes</HI> relates, That they came daily to his House, spending the time in asking all manner of Questions concerning God and his Divine Works.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth Reason may be known by the <HI>Bonzies.</HI></NOTE>The fourth Reason of the happy and prosperous success of the <HI>Catholick Re∣ligion</HI> in <HI>Japan,</HI> may be drawn from the <HI>Bonzies,</HI> who not onely taught wicked and abominable Doctrine, but lead also very debauch'd and vicious Lives: What <HI>Lodowick Frojus</HI> writes in a Letter from <HI>Firando</HI> to the <HI>Indian Jesuits</HI> con∣cerning their abominable Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their wicked Religion.</NOTE> may serve for a pattern: He tells us of a Gentlewoman that was ninety years old, who had paid her Devotions in seve∣ral of the <HI>Japan</HI> Temples, and bestow'd great Revenues upon some of them; this Bounty of hers was requited by the <HI>Bonzies</HI> with a Paper Coat, which they esteem'd very highly, for the Life of <HI>Amida</HI> was at large written therein; and it was accounted an extraordinary and peculiar favor to purchase such a Coat with a great sum of Money: for the Woman dying in the same, was im∣mediately transported to the happy Place of <HI>Amida</HI>'s Residence, without suffer∣ing any pain to cleanse her from her former offences. But <HI>Johannes Fernandes</HI> being fetch'd to a sick Person, of kindred to the foremention'd Gentlewoman, discoursed with her, laying open the vainness of the Paper Coat; against which he us'd so many arguments, that she tore and burnt it.</P>
<P>The other wickednesses of their Religion appears by murdering themselves to the honor of <HI>Amida,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cruelties.</NOTE> <HI>Xaca,</HI> and <HI>Canon.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bonzies</HI> live very debauch'd.</NOTE>And no less abominable were the Lives of the <HI>Bonzies,</HI> whose Debauche∣ries, Drunkenness, Whoring, Murdering, and other outrages, were known to most People: nay, they accounted it no sin to Rob upon the High-ways, and go a Pyrating upon the Sea, oftentimes venturing to set upon whole Towns and Villages, burning the Houses to the ground, and putting the Inhabitants all to the Sword, not so much as sparing the poor Infants: for which their Cruelties the Emperor <HI>Nobunanga</HI> burnt their Cloysters; and as many as he could get of the <HI>Bonzies,</HI> caus'd them to be nail'd on Crosses, to die a lingring Death.</P>
<P>This made the way clear for the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> who told them they were come above six thousand Leagues over the Sea to <HI>Japan,</HI> to no other end, but to teach them the right Road to Salvation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fifth Reason is the alliance of the <HI>Japan</HI> Reli∣gion with the <HI>Catholick.</HI></NOTE>At last the little difference which was between the <HI>Japan</HI> Religion and the <HI>Catholick,</HI> made an easie way for the <HI>Jesuits</HI> to settle it</P>
<P><HI>Xaverius</HI> relates, that the <HI>Bonzies</HI> themselves told the first <HI>Jesuits,</HI> That haply they might prevail among the common People, for that betwixt the two Re∣ligions was but small difference; yet then they declared onely the Doctrine of
<PB N="253" REF="158"/>

</FIGURE>
the Trinity. But after they got greater footing, they perform'd all their Church-Ceremonies in publick, at which the <HI>Japanners</HI> much admir'd; and furthermore Preach'd the <HI>Roman</HI> Doctrine.</P>
<P>And certainly there was a great resemblance of the <HI>Japan</HI> Religion to the other; according to which the <HI>Dayro</HI> in <HI>Meaco</HI> governs himself not much unlike the Pope at <HI>Rome.</HI> Moreover, the <HI>Japanners</HI> have an infinite number of Cloy∣sters, full of Priestesses, and Nuns, who punish themselves for their sins, and account Marriage unlawful in some of their religious Orders. They are per∣swaded, that the more largely they shew their Charity to the Cloysters, the soon∣er they shall go to <HI>Amida</HI>'s happy dwelling; so that their Bounty in those par∣ticulars makes them equal in their future happiness: for the Heirs of the De∣ceased, with Gifts and Presents, beseech the <HI>Bonzies</HI> to deliver them by their means from their Pain. They all Read their Prayers by Beads. Concerning matters of Religion, none may Judge but the <HI>Dayro</HI> and a Cloyster. They ac∣count it great Piety in any to visit the Tombs or Shrines of the <HI>Japan</HI> Saints.</P>
<P>These were the chiefest Reasons why the <HI>Catholick Faith</HI> went on so success∣fully in <HI>Japan;</HI> which nevertheless for divers causes before-mention'd met with such oppositions, that at this day there is scarce one <HI>Christian</HI> to be found in the Countrey. <HI>Nobunanga, Taicosama,</HI> and <HI>Daifusama,</HI> as we have already menti∣on'd, begun to persecute them; but being continually busi'd with Civil Wars amongst themselves, they found their hands so full, that their Cruelties gave some little intermissions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Persecution of the <HI>Christians.</HI></NOTE>But when <HI>Conbosama</HI> took possession of the Imperial Throne, he feard none, since <HI>Fideri</HI> was burnt with the chiefest of the Nobility by his Father <HI>Daifusama.</HI> Thus suspecting no manner of Insurrection. <HI>Anno</HI> 1617, he began anew to raise Persecutions, endeavoring totally to subvert <HI>Christianity</HI> and utterly root out all its Professors, with the greatest torturing that could be thought on: there∣fore when to be nail'd on Crosses, and run through the Sides with two Lan∣ces, seem'd too easie a Death, and to be beheaded was far easier: Therefore he
<PB N="254" REF="159"/>resolv'd to make them feel a more painful and lingring <HI>Exit;</HI> and that he per∣form'd by roasting them to death in this manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christians are <HI>Roasted.</HI></NOTE> First a great Post was dri∣ven into the Earth, placing several Pyles of Wood about it, and onely leaving a Gap or Passage open towards that Corner from whence the Wind blew, through which those that were to suffer pass'd to the Stake, to which they were bound by the Hands with a Rope of twelve Foot long; and about the same di∣stance the Wood lay about the Post, excepting onely where the Gap was left, to the end the Wind might blow away the Smoak, that the Martyrs might not suddenly be choaked up, and so die sooner and easier than those bloody Perse∣cutors desir'd, so that they were roasted by degrees, and died, if it were possible, a thousand Deaths in one, undergoing the miserablest torture that could be imagin'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burning of Men very an∣tient.</NOTE> This kind of burning of Mankind had a long time before been us'd in the World, but never in so cruel a method as in <HI>Japan.</HI> The Holy Scripture tells us of <HI>Juda,</HI> that he condemn'd his Daughter in Law to be burnt, because she had committed Adultery;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 38.24.</NOTE> of which <HI>Moses</HI> saith thus, <HI>Bring Thamar forth and let her be burnt.</HI> The <HI>Rabbin Jews</HI> affirm, that <HI>Thamar</HI> was the Priest <HI>Mel∣chisedech</HI>'s Daughter, and therefore for her Uncleanness was to be burnt by or∣der of the holy Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Levit.</HI> 31.6.</NOTE> which saith, <HI>If a Priest's Daughter play the Whore, she polluteth her Father, therefore she shall be burnt with fire.</HI> But the <HI>Rabbin Jews</HI> are very igno∣rant in their reckoning of Time, in which they commonly make great mistakes, as taking <HI>Thamar</HI> to be <HI>Mechisedech</HI>'s Daughter, not onely without testimony, but also against apparent truth: for there is above two hundred years diffe∣rence betwixt the Age of <HI>Melchisedech</HI> and <HI>Thamar.

This voyce <HI>Isdigerdes</HI> took as an Oracle, and thereupon resolv'd to put away <HI>Maruthas,</HI> notwithstanding he had cur'd him of an intolerable pain in his Head: But <HI>Maruthas</HI> discovering the Cheat to the King, soon after obtain'd free priviledge for the <HI>Christians</HI> in <HI>Persia.

But others maintain'd the contrary, holding it best to cleanse and purifie the Body by the Flame, that so it might neither rot, nor occasion any noisomness or stench: which Opinion was held by most of the Eastern People, as also amongst the <HI>Germans, Spaniards, Gauls,</HI> and <HI>Britains.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plin.</HI> l. 8 c. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></NOTE> But this Custom of burning the Dead was a long time after entertain'd by the <HI>Romans:</HI> for which <HI>Pliny</HI> gives this Reason, because their Enemies would oftentimes dig
<PB N="256" REF="160"/>the dead Bones out of the Graves, carrying them away as Trophies; which to prevent, they follow'd that fashion of the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Indians:</HI> but whether that were the true reason or no, sure we are, that the first among them re∣corded to be burnt, was the Consul <HI>Sylla,</HI> which he himself commanded, fear∣ing to be serv'd in like manner as he had done to his Competitor <HI>Marius,</HI> whom he digg'd up out of his Grave.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Romans</HI> had once throughly entertain'd this Custom,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> l. 12. c 18.</NOTE> none were equal to them, for the magnificent preparations of Funeral Pyles, furnishing the same with the sweetest Perfumes, for which they bestowed great sums of Money.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Nero,</HI> according to the foremention'd <HI>Pliny,</HI> burnt more Per∣fume with the dead Corps of his Empress <HI>Poppea,</HI> than all <HI>Arabia Felix</HI> could produce in one year.</P>

<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> stuck the Body of one that had murder'd his Father, full of sharp Canes, then cutting him in many places, they at last threw him on a great heap of Thorns, which being set on fire consum'd him.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Murders of the Em∣peror in <HI>Fissima.</HI></NOTE>¶ AS soon as <HI>Conbosama,</HI> after the decease of his Father, possess'd the Impe∣rial Throne, he began his Reign, as we in part mention'd with ex∣ceeding Tyranny: for travelling through <HI>Fissima,</HI> he commanded the Gover∣nor <HI>Ingandono</HI> to cause all <HI>Christians,</HI> Men, Women, and Children, to be roasted to death.</P>
<P>During the Civil Wars, since the <HI>Dayro</HI> lost his sole and unlimited Autho∣rity, every King in his own Realm play'd the Master.

<P>But after <HI>Daifusama</HI> became Conqueror in many Battels, reducing the whole Countrey of <HI>Japan</HI> under his subjection, the Kings Authorities and Power were all limited; so that they all depended on the Emperor, and were strictly com∣manded for no sinister ends to permit the <HI>Christians</HI> to teach their Belief. Being thus order'd, all of them were forc'd to obey, making great search for the <HI>Roman</HI> Priests, of which he took at last <HI>Peter ab Ascensione</HI> a <HI>Franciscan, Johannes Baptista Machada</HI> a <HI>Jesuit, Alphonso Navarre</HI> a <HI>Dominican,</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand a Santo Jo∣sepho</HI> an <HI>Augustine,</HI> and caus'd them all to be beheaded in <HI>Omura.</HI></P>

Each House near the Place where the Execution is to be, must procure a certain quantity of Wood, either more or less, according to the number of those that are to be burnt: This done, the care to see it perform'd is left to the Master-Warden, who is to answer for it if any thing be wanting. Behind him that stands knocking on the Bason sits one of the Emperors Ser∣vants, and also a Tradesman on a Carpet spread all over the Waggon; the first holds a scollop'd Flag, on whose top hang two Tassels; the other holds a long Cane, at the end of it hangs a bunch of Grapes made of Brass, whereto is ty'd a String full of Knots; the Waggon guarded on each side with a Fyle of Pike-men and Musqueteers, and the like Guard marching before and behind; at the end of every Street they all stand still, where the Cryer tells them aloud what every House is to do. Afterwards, at the Place of Execution, as many Posts are driven into the Ground as there are Persons to die, and great heaps of Wood are laid almost round about; at last, at the appointed time the Pri∣soners are brought, and the Fire kindled, where (as we have already related) by the distant Fire they were lingringly roasted, so dying a long and most mi∣serable death.</P>

<PB N="258" REF="161"/>as holy Reliques, insomuch that the next day little or nothing was to be seen of either of their Corps: This being very ill resented by the Governor of <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> to prevent the same another time, on the next Moneth, being <HI>Au∣gust, Anno</HI> 1622. when they had condemn'd <HI>Carolus Spinola</HI> the <HI>Jesuit,</HI> and <HI>Fran∣ciscus de Morales</HI> the <HI>Dominican, Hyacinthus Orfanel,</HI> and <HI>Alphonso de Mena,</HI> caus'd their Bodies to be thrown into a deep Pit full of Wood, there burning them to Ashes, which being rak'd together, was carry'd a good distance from the Shore, and there scatter'd abroad into the Sea by the Wind, to the end there might no∣thing of them remain.</P>
<P>But besides the foremention'd <HI>Jesuit</HI> and <HI>Dominican,</HI> others were also burnt at the same time, amongst which was a <HI>Brusseller,</HI> who coming within the Pyles of Wood would not be ty'd with one Hand to the Post, but falling down on his Knees held fast about the bottom of it, and so died; others which stood upright, scorch'd and burnt by degrees, till at last they died through excess of most intolerable pain. <HI>Hyacinthus Orfanel</HI> stood most in the Wind, and was least hurt by the Flame,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsanel</HI> was sixteen hours <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> burning.</NOTE> so that he was full sixteen hours miserably tormented before he gave up the Ghost.

<P>After this <HI>Camilius de Constanzo</HI> the <HI>Jesuit</HI> was in like manner burnt neat <HI>Firan∣do,</HI> and <HI>Paulas Navarrus</HI> in the City <HI>Ximabara.</HI></P>

It seems a matter worthy no small admiration, that a Child of six Years old, being amongst these twelve Martyrs, endur'd all the foremention'd Tortures with inexpressible Courage. Thus punish'd, they were cast into Prison. Mean while the number of the discover'd <HI>Christians</HI> amounted to one and forty, which all patiently endur'd the foremention'd Afflictions; insomuch that at last the Executioners seem'd to be more wearied and tir'd than the Sufferers; of which seventeen, having large and heavy Stones ty'd about their Middles, were carry'd a good distance into the Offin, and there thrown over-board; amongst which number, was a Man and his Wife, and three Children, the one seventeen, the other thirteen, and the youngest six years old; who being terrifi'd with such strange Preparations, began to cry when the Executioners laid hold of him to tye the Stones about his Waste; whereupon they asking the Parents if they would have the Child to live, and they replying <HI>No,</HI> it was drown'd with the rest.</P>

<P>But though <HI>Onemendonne</HI> drove so many Stakes up and down in the City, yet nothing else follow'd, than that the thirty Noblemen, with some Soldiers,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reasons of the Hot Watters are sought after.</NOTE>The Learned have spent much Labor and Time to find out the Reasons of these boyling Springs.

Here also it is to be observ'd, That the Fire dries up the Water, or the Water extinguishes the Fire, so soon as the one gets the Mastery of the other: So that without contradiction, the force of the Fire must either dry up the flowing Waters, and consume the Earth underneath to Ashes; or else the Water, which has pass'd through it so many Ages, must needs have quench'd the Fire. For who will believe that Water and Fire are of one force and pow∣er under Ground, and so agreeable in Nature, that the one should not extin∣guish the other.</P>

<P><HI>Francis Caron</HI> relates, That he spake with those that had hung three days in that horrible manner, but at last forswore the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, not being able to endure this pain, which exceeded Fire, and all other imaginable cruelties; their Bowels sinking down into their Throats, seem'd to force all their intrails out of their Mouths, the Blood also dropping out at their Eyes, Mouths, Noses and Ears.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Macaco</HI> sends an Embas∣sy to the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor.</NOTE>¶ IN the interim, the Inhabitants of <HI>Macaco</HI> were much concern'd, seeing that profitable Trade of <HI>Japan</HI> was forbidden them; and therefore they thought it convenient, to send an Embassy thither, to inform the Emperor, that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> never sent any Priests thither, nor that they had the least knowledge of the Insurrection at <HI>Arima.</HI> The Ambassadors, <HI>Lovis Paez Pacheco, Roderigo Sanches de Paredes, Simon Vaz de Paiva,</HI> and <HI>Gonsaho Monteiro de Carvalho,</HI> spent a whole years time in their Preparation.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contents of the Procla∣mation.</NOTE>The Contents were, <HI>That since the spreading of the Christian Religion in</HI> Japan, <HI>(apparently contrary to the Emperors Edicts,) Wickedness, and Debauchery was grown to a great height in that Empire, therefore necessity forc'd them to execute great Punishments upon them, and at last to give a stop to all private Dealings with the</HI> Portuguese, <HI>on For∣feiture of his Majesties high Displeasure; Those, that notwithstanding his Commands, ven∣tur'd to come to</HI> Japan, <HI>where to this day, many Priests were privately kept, whose design was nothing else, but to stir up the People against their Just and Lawful Governors, to turn the Empire into a Blood-Bath, and bring it under the Subjection of a Foreign Tyrant: And though the</HI> Portugal <HI>Ambassdors inform'd them in Person, that they neither sent, or kept any Priests in</HI> Japan, <HI>yet the</HI> Macaco <HI>Letters make no mention thereof, therefore what was said, they dis-own'd, and suspected them not without great reasons; and for that cause, the Emperor Prosecutes such Malefactors that offend his Authority, Condemning them all to the Sword, except some of the meanest Seamen which were spared alive, to the end, they might give an account of this Adventure to the</HI> Portuguese <HI>in</HI> Macaco; <HI>and also that those should expect the same that durst hereafter adventure to Anchor in any</HI> Ja∣pan <HI>Haven.</HI></P>

<P>In <HI>Ximabara, Bungodono</HI> kept fifty Christians Prisoners, which in a disgraceful manner, were led through the Streets of the City to a Plain near the Sea-side; against seven of them he was very severe, namely, <HI>Thomas Chibioius, Paul Nagata, Leonardus Sacuzaiemon, Joannes Gonzaiemon, Jenixus Dines, Maria,</HI> and <HI>Clara, Nagata's</HI> Wife, because they had been instruments to the spreading of Christianity; there∣fore, in the foremention'd Field were digg'd seven Pits, three Fathom deep and six wide, at an equal distance one from the other, in each of them stood a thick Post, with a piece of Timber nail'd on the top thereof, like a Cross: the Condemned sate down whilst their Arms being stretch'd out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A cursed way of Executi∣on.</NOTE> were made fast to the cross piece, their Necks were lock'd betwixt two thick Planks made hollow in the middle, so that their Heads appear'd immoveable above them: <HI>Bungodono</HI> was one of those that perform'd this Office; first <HI>Sacuzaiemon's</HI> right Arm was leisurely Saw'd off; then they began to file the Necks of those that were made fast with sharp tooth Canes, strowing Salt into the Wounds; five days they continu'd their filing, without unbinding them, or letting them have the least rest.

<P>The remaining three and forty, stood the first and second day as Spectators, but on the third and fourth, they were ty'd Hand and Feet, and plac'd on a sharp piece of Wood, with a great Stone in their Laps, close by the Martyrs.

<P>The Learned <HI>Julius Scaliger</HI> is of opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Scal.

<P>It seemeth that the Name <HI>Joseph</HI> is changed to <HI>Apis,</HI> because the People should serve a more supreme Deity, and not worship a Man.</P>
<P><HI>Augustine,</HI> or the Writer of the Wonders of Scripture, relates, That the <HI>Egyptians</HI> placed an Ox by <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Burying-place, because it is the usefullest Creature in Tilling. and <HI>Joseph</HI>'s explaining <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Dream, in which he saw seven fat Oxen climbing out of <HI>Nylus,</HI> and after that seven lean ones: There is a great Mystery in it, that the Oxen should just come out of the <HI>Nyle;</HI> for <HI>Egypts</HI> scarcity and plenty depends on the same, according as the River flows more or less over the Countrey.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plin.</HI> l. 5. c. 9.</NOTE> That <HI>Egypt</HI> suffers Famine when the <HI>Nyle</HI> is eighteen Foot above the Ground; nay, that they want still, though it be nineteen and a half; but one and twenty brings them plenty, and four and twenty abundance.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Joseph</HI> explain'd not onely the King's Dream, but gave him ex∣ceeding good Counsel, That the fifth part of the Growth the Subjects should give to the King; and Store-houses were built for the reception thereof.</P>
<P>Furthermore, to represent the plenty and scarcity of <HI>Egypt,</HI> nothing was more convenient than fat and lean Oxen: Therefore the <HI>Romans,</HI> in honor to the Overseer of their Provisions, <HI>Lucius Minutius,</HI> erected a Gilded Ox without the Portcullis'd Gate, because he brought down the Price of the Corn, and sold it to the People, as <HI>Livius</HI> relates it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Livius</HI> lib. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>According to the fruitfulness of the Year, Bread is either cheap or dear.

<P>The Ancients did so much esteem an Ox, that they condemn'd those to death that kill'd one.</P>
<P><HI>Ealianus</HI> adds hereunto,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aelian.</HI> l. 5. c. 14.</NOTE> That there was amongst the <HI>Athenians</HI> this Law establish'd, <HI>An Ox which draws either Plough or Waggon you shall not kill, because he is a Laborer and Companion in humane Society.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> being amaz'd at <HI>Joseph</HI>'s wisdom and understanding, shew'd
<PB N="278" REF="173"/>him exceeding great honor, insomuch that he made him Vice-Roy over all <HI>Egypt.</HI> He also gave him a Ring, which he put on his Finger, not onely for a testimony of his honor, but also to Seal his Letters Patents; and chang'd his Name <HI>Joseph</HI> into <HI>Saphenath Paneah,</HI> which <HI>Onkelus</HI> saith, signifies <HI>A Man to whom Secrets are disclos'd;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hieron Quaest.

<P>It was then customary amongst the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> to preserve the Memory of those Princes which had done Service for the Publick, and to Posterity, by erecting their Images: But they thought there could be no better Representa∣tion to express <HI>Joseph</HI>'s noble and beneficial Deeds than an Ox. And without doubt this honor in the beginning was not common, for otherwise <HI>Joseph</HI> would not have permitted them to make an Idol of him, or suffer'd himself to be worshipp'd; which the Priests perform'd by keeping an Ox, which was shewn to the People to put them in mind of <HI>Joseph</HI>'s goodness in the time of the seven years Faminc.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Joseph</HI> worshipp'd in the shape of an Ox.</NOTE>After the expiration of of some years this private Honor became a publick Religion, for valiant Men that had perform'd noble Exploits and Atchieve∣ments in their lives, were by the <HI>Greeks</HI> interr'd in stately Tombs, with their Images and Characters Engraven and set on them, and a peculiar Worship ap∣pointed them. What wonder is it then if the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who were wont to ac∣knowledge their deceased Princes as gods, which in their Lives had Govern'd their Subjects with wisdom and prudence, invented a method for worshipping of <HI>Joseph,</HI> who when he liv'd was call'd <HI>Saphena Paneah,</HI> that is, <HI>Preserver of the World:</HI> And so great was the impression his goodness left upon that People, that after-Generations without contradiction believ'd, and have shewn more honor and reverence to <HI>Joseph</HI> than to any other.</P>

<P>Hereto is added, That <HI>Joseph</HI> enrich'd many of the chief <HI>Egyptian</HI> Princes; and without doubt rais'd his Relations to the highest Dignities, and therefore was in great esteem and favor and by that means the easier, according to the <HI>Japan</HI> manner, worshipp'd under the form of the Ox <HI>Apis,</HI> in the chief City <HI>Memphis,</HI> which would not be inferior to <HI>Heliopolis;</HI> wherein, according to <HI>Plu∣tarch,</HI> the black Ox <HI>Mnavis</HI> was religiously ador'd.</P>

<P>The Images of these Devils rest on horrible Dragons; that spit forth Fire from their gaping Mouths, and are made after a terrible manner. Of them they desire to know the event of such things as they take in hand; which they do thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange dealings with evil Shapes.</NOTE> They have two Woodden Buttons as big as Acorns, which are split in the middle, and strung on a piece of Thred, which they throw down at the Feet of one of these evil Spirits: if they both fall with the flat sides down∣wards, or one on the flat, and the other on the round side, that they look up∣on as a bad Omen: for which cause they rail exceedingly against their Deity; but immediately after, as if they repented, they again flatter him, and sue for pardon, by offering Sacrifice: and whenever their lot falls out unlucki∣ly, they fall from Words to Blows, throwing the Image into the Water, or burn some part off from his Body: then they fall again to Praying. This kind of scolding and worshipping continues so long, till both the Buttons fall flat on the Ground; whereupon they all rejoyce, thanking the evil Spirit, presenting him with all manner of Dainties curiously drest, as Ducks, Geese, Rice, and Swines Heads, accounted one of their best Dishes, and a Can of Wine: When they have laid a little scrap of the foremention'd Dishes on the Altar before the Image, as the Tip of the Hogs Ear, the Claws of the fore∣mention'd Fowls, and some drops of Wine, they fall upon the rest themselves, and eat it up with a great deal of mirth and good appetite.</P>
<P>There are also Priests amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> establish'd by <HI>Lanzis,</HI> whose Mother went big with him eighty years. These draw on yellow Paper hor∣rible Shapes of evil Spirits, which they stick on the Walls of the Houses; then they run all over the House, making a noise, as if they were Devils themselves; and by this means they pretend to banish the Devil.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods with many Heads in <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE>But as to what concerns the Four-headed Idol, the <HI>Japanners</HI> have divers Gods with several Heads; for they oftentimes make <HI>Xaca</HI> with three, which they cover all with one Cap: Sometimes they represent <HI>Canon</HI> the Son of <HI>Ami∣da</HI> with seven Heads on his Breast.

<P>But to come to our Description: Between the foremention'd Ancient Phi∣losopher, and Four-headed King, an Image appears representing the Sun, ri∣sing out of the Water, cloth'd in a Vest, part of it seeming under the Water; over his left Arm a Scarf, and in the same hand many sharp Spikes; his Beard long, and on his Head a Crown of golden Rays; his right Hand arm'd with a Steeletto, or sharp Iron Bodkin, with which it seems to prick and push the Tortoise, on which the Brazen Tree, and the Creator (as they call him) rest, to cause it to turn; which moves so slowly, that they say it comes but once about in a thousand Years.</P>
<P>Nothing is less to be admir'd, than that the <HI>Japanners</HI> worship the Sun also in their Temples; for no Idolatry whatsoever can boast to be so old, in which they did not worship the Sun; whose Adoration was more Venerable, and spread it self further than any Idol whatsoever; concerning whose Antiquity, <HI>Job</HI> speaks thus;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> 31.26.27.</NOTE> <HI>If I beheld the Sun when it shined, or the Moon walking in brightness: And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand.</HI> Here this Adoration of the Celestial Bodies, after the manner of the <HI>Heathens,</HI> is appa∣rent, according to which, the first Worshippers of the Sun kiss'd their Hands, in token of Honor;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>App. Met.</HI> lib. 4.</NOTE> though afterwards, according to <HI>Apuleius,</HI> they bent only their foremost right Finger towards the Thumb, whilst they turn'd themselves round,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut.</HI> 4.19.</NOTE> and pray'd to the Rising Sun. <HI>Moses</HI> also saith; <HI>And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto Heaven, and when thou seest the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars, even all the Host of Heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them.</HI> But notwith∣standing Gods Commands, the <HI>Israelites</HI> have chiefly learn'd the Sun-worship from the <HI>Syrians,</HI> which call'd the Sun <HI>Bahal,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Lord;</HI> the <HI>Phenici∣ans, Beel-Samen</HI> (according to <HI>Philo,</HI> from the Ancient Writer <HI>Sanchoriathon</HI>) which is, <HI>Lord of the Heavens:</HI> The Inhabitants of the <HI>Phenician</HI> City <HI>Accaron,</HI> gave the Sun the Name of <HI>Baal-zehaim,</HI> signifying, <HI>The Lord of Offerings;</HI> but afterwards that Name was chang'd to <HI>Baal-zebub,</HI> that is, <HI>The God of Flies,</HI> to whom in bad Times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Abstinent.

The Cinnamon-sticks, brought together, were divided by the Priests in Holy Ground. That part which remain'd for the Merchants, was by them carried away as soon as paid for: Then the Priests took every one their part; but if any was imbezilled in the sharing, it was instantly known; for if justly di∣vided, the Sun-beams fir'd the Fragments and broken Pieces that were neglect∣ed and left scatter'd behind, otherwise not; as <HI>Theophrastus, Pliny,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heophr Hist.

For which cause they mock'd at the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when they told them of a Savior; telling them, <HI>That they had a better God, which appear'd every Morning in Glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Josephus Acosta</HI> relates peculiarly concerning the <HI>Peruvians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Mor. Var.

Then he turn'd his ranting Discourse, and fell upon the King; which he not taking well, but much displeas'd at his endless Railing, wanting not much of distraction, the King command∣ed Silence, telling him, <HI>That he well remembred one of the</HI> Bonzi, <HI>a special Pat∣tern of Piety and Sober Life; but he was fitter in his judgment to serve the Devil, and the Fiends of Hell, than be any ways instrumental in the Worship of the Ever-just Gods, Eternal haters of all Debauchery.</HI> But <HI>Faciandono</HI> no ways daunted with this smart Expression of the Kings, but rather more discompos'd, in a rage re∣ply'd thus; <HI>Well Sir, the time will come, when such will be my Power and Authority over Mortals, in the other World, that I shall dispose of them at my Leasure, and how I please: And you King of</HI> Bungo, <HI>though you look so big in all your Greatness now, then shall address your self to me, scarce regarding such a Trifle as a King, or any Prince whatsoever.</HI> This arrogant return of his was very ill resented; yet <HI>Facian∣dono</HI> raising his Voice, ranted higher, saying, <HI>May Fire from Heaven consume thee, thou King of</HI> Bungo, <HI>that darest offer, or once open that thy Mouth, to Blaspheme the holy Priest of the just and ever-living Gods.</HI></Q></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bonzi-Neugori</HI> much ha∣ted.</NOTE>¶YEt above all others, the <HI>Bonzi-Neugori,</HI> that have promoted the Deluder <HI>Cacubau</HI> to the Dignity of a <HI>Numen</HI> are the most hated; their chiefest Residence, <HI>Fatonochaiti,</HI> being a meer Den of Murderers: For they live with∣out a Superior, and determine on nothing but with a general Vote; so that oftentimes differing in their Consultations, they fall at variance, and go toge∣ther by the Ears, insomuch that they kill one another.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their strange Conversa∣tion.</NOTE>These <HI>Neugori</HI> bring up a considerable number of Youths to Thieving and Defrauding of the People: Such as exceed the rest in Wit and Cunning, are chiefly instructed about the Descents and Exploits of the <HI>Japan</HI> Kings, and State-Affairs; being also exercis'd in Martial Discipline, and taught the Art of Rhetorical Speaking. And thus instructed, they travel to the remotest King∣doms, where they give themselves out to be the Sons of <HI>Japan</HI> Kings or Prin∣ce, living in another part of the Empire; being the rather credited, because they appear in Kingly Apparel, and carry themselves exceeding Stately: And when they have brought their Game to the height, then they ask for Money, as wanting Bills of Exchange to furnish them for their present Occasions. It is very seldom but they find one or other that will disburse Money for them, upon giving them a Note, not without promise of great Interest. So soon as they have thus fill'd their Purses, they return with the Booty back to their Cloysters: For which cause,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are every where kili'd, if known.</NOTE> if the <HI>Neugori</HI> from <HI>Fatonochaiti</HI> are known any where, they are without mercy Ston'd to death. Notwithstanding this hatred which the <HI>Japanners</HI> bear against them, yet they are afraid of them, because they are very expert in Arms.</P>
<P>Their Order is divided into three Sects; some observing their Religion; others make and deliver daily five Arrows a Man; the third sort exercise them∣selves continually in War, not unlike the Knights of <HI>Malta;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Maintain War.</NOTE> so that they often raise Rebellion against their Princes. <HI>Anno</HI> 1561. they brought thirty thou∣sand Men into the Field; and Encamping themselves between <HI>Meaco</HI> and <HI>Sac∣cai,</HI> fought a great Battel against the <HI>Cubus,</HI> and getting victoriously into <HI>Mea∣co,</HI> set the City on Fire. Yet not long after, Success making them negligent and careless, they were surpriz'd, and expell'd with no small Loss: Yet were they not so routed, but that they since encounter'd with the Powerful King <HI>Nobunanga;</HI> but with such ill Fortune, that most of them were slain on the Spot.</P>

<PB N="290" REF="179"/>
<P>These <HI>Bonzies</HI> have great Priviledge beyond the other; for they have leave to be merry, and eat all manner of Food that the Sea and Earth affords. Some of their Temples receive a yearly Revenue out of the Emperors Trea∣sury, or else from the Customs and Tolls growing due in that Countrey where they are founded: Others are maintain'd by the ordinary People. Every one contributes to the Maintenance of his Chappel and Priest to which he belongs; for every Sect of the <HI>Bonzi</HI> have their Congregation. They never trouble each other about Differences of Religion; nay, the Citizens never dispute about their Opinions in matter of Faith, though their several Sects differ much one from another.</P>
<P>Most of their Temples are Houses of Good-fellowship; for which reason, many of them are built in the most delightful Places; where they come often∣times together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Recreation of the <HI>Bonzi.</HI></NOTE> no otherwise than to a Drinking-Club, in the presence of all their Gods. Common Strumpets are brought thither: Conceal'd Adultery the <HI>Bonzies</HI> wink at. Yet other <HI>Bonzies</HI> live more retir'd, coming sometimes at Midnight, on certain Hours, together, to say their Prayers; and in order, taking it by turns, perform their Offices, which they read out of the last Book of <HI>Xaca,</HI> call'd, <HI>Foquequium,</HI> before their Altars. In the Evening every one hath his Task set him, to get by Heart against Morning, and to declare it to the Head <HI>Bonzies.</HI></P>
<P>¶ BUt the <HI>Bonzies</HI> of the eleventh Sect exceed the rest in a strict and retir'd Life; for they abstain from Women, and all manner of Food that ever lived; and if it be known to the Magistrates, that any of them hath transgress'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Punishment in∣flicted on some Criminal <HI>Bonzies.</HI></NOTE> or broken his Vows, the Criminal is put into a Hole, and co∣ver'd half way with Earth, being made fast in the same; and every one that passes by, though it be a Nobleman, must give a cut with a Wooden Saw on the Neck of the half-buried Priest: So that generally it is the fourth day be∣fore he comes to his End.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Bonzies</HI> are high∣ly esteem'd.</NOTE>¶ A Retir'd and Abstinent Life brings the <HI>Bonzies</HI> into great esteem; and therefore several of their Sects live onely on Pot-herbs, Water, and Rice. Besides, many <HI>Bonzies</HI> are of Noble and Princely Extract; for when the Fathers are over-charg'd with Children, fearing to leave them but small Shares, they put some of them into Cloysters, to the end their Goods at the time of their Death may go the farther, and that so they may keep up their Family.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bonzies</HI> Sermons.</NOTE>¶ THe Doctrines which the <HI>Bonzi</HI> teach, are commonly Reprehensions against Worldly Care, by which the ordinary Man is so taken up, that he minds nothing of the Laws tending to Salvation; for which the <HI>Bon∣zi</HI> proffer their Service, to take upon them their Offences, and sue for their Pardon from the Gods; so that none shall be damn'd, how great soever their Sins are; for the Gods will deliver them from the Flames of Hell-fire: Yet with this <HI>Proviso,</HI> If they set a high esteem on, and are bountifully liberal to the <HI>Bonzi</HI> that intercede for them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Women and poor People can scarce be sav'd.</NOTE>This Promise of Salvation is only to Rich and Eminent People; but for the Poor People, there is no Redemption from Hell.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bonzi</HI> give Bills of Ex∣change.</NOTE>The <HI>Bonzi</HI> also, in their Publick Preachings, declare, <Q>That those that give them any Money, shall receive the same again, with ten times the Interest, in the Life to come.</Q> And since few there are that misdoubt so great a gain, the <HI>Bonzies</HI> have labor enough to make them Bills of Exchange for their Mo∣ney, which they preserve very carefully; and chiefly, all dying Persons give strict charge, that they bury the foremention'd Bills with them, that so they may receive both Principal and Interest in the other World; and also because the Devil flies from all such Papers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Bon∣zies</HI> Preaching.</NOTE>The <HI>Bonzies</HI> make their Sermons in a handsom manner; for he that Preach∣es, stands on a high Pulpit, hung round about with a rich <HI>Japan</HI> Cloth: The Ascent thereof is made on the right side, not without curious Rails and Steps: On the left side sits an Idol, with his Legs under him, after the <HI>Japan</HI> manner, on a high Altar, either of <HI>Amida, Xaca, Canon,</HI> or any other, according to the Sect of which the <HI>Bonzies</HI> are. Next to the Idol, are those that bring Offer∣ings, being all manner of Dainties; which after performance of Service, they and the <HI>Bonzies</HI> together devour. Both the Idol and Offerers sit on a high Seat, rail'd about. Over the Pulpit is a square Covering, which rests forward on two thick Pillars, made fast behind in the Walls. On the top also hang on both sides of the Preacher two burning Lamps, each hanging by four Strings, and with as many Lights. Before the Pulpit stands a square Scaffold, rail'd in on three sides, and three Foot in height; in the middle of which stands the Pulpit: On this Scaffold sit or stand the Readers or Servants to the <HI>Bonzies:</HI> In the Pulpit lies the Holy Book of <HI>Foquequium;</HI> and near it, a Shell. The Priest getting into the Pulpit, looks a considerable time about him: In his right Hand he holds a broad golden Fan; his Head is cover'd with an <HI>Umbrello</HI> of Silk, not much unlike a Straw Hat. Before he speaks aloud, he makes a great shew in silence of his intended Design. Lastly, he rings the Bell, as a Sign commanding Silence; after which, none makes the least noise. Then the Priest begins to read some Rules out of their Law-Book <HI>Foquequium,</HI> on which he makes a long Sermon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bonzi</HI> speak well in their Sermons.</NOTE><HI>Gasper Villela,</HI> well-experienc'd in the <HI>Japan</HI> Tongue, relates, <Q>That he hath oftentimes admir'd the excellent Language of the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> which are no ways inferior to any <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI> Preachers, either in their compleat Behavior and elegant Style, or for their curious Words, and moving Arguments to their purpose. The Nobleness of their Discourse borrows also a little from the Lustre of their Apparel; for the Minister standing on a rich Stool, is cloth'd in Silk from Head to Foot; about his Middle is ty'd a broad Gir∣dle. The Applications to their Sermons are commonly these, or the like:<NOTE PLACE="marg">After what manner they end their Sermons.</NOTE> <HI>It is requisite to bestow good and plentiful Gifts on the Cloysters, because Priests reside in them, that intercede for Men to the Gods, by their Prayers and Pious Works; so that in this Life they receive Worldly Blessings by their means, and in the Life to come, ten times more than they bestow on the</HI> Bonzi.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Audi∣tors in the <HI>Japan</HI> Temples.</NOTE>The Auditors flock in great numbers to their Churches, which are generally cramm'd full to the very Doors. At the sound of a Bell they all fall on their Knees, and pour forth a Prayer with great Zeal; this continues a whole Hour. Their Hands and Beads they lift up towards Heaven, (for they are us'd by them, crying often very loud, <HI>Namu Amida ambut,</HI> that is, <HI>Amida give Salvation;</HI> which Prayer is onely us'd by that Sect which acknowledge <HI>Amida</HI> for their God and Preserver.

<P>During the time that one of the <HI>Bonzi</HI> preaches, the rest sit one by another on the Steps of the Altar, with their Hands wrapp'd in their Coats, and their Eyes cast downwards. All the twelve Sects affirm, <Q>That none can be sav'd without the Holy Book <HI>Foquequium;</HI> but as for other things, they differ in their Opinions.</Q></P>
<P>Those that shew Reverence to the Idol <HI>Canon, Amida</HI>'s Son, would be taken for the most Pious and Religiousest Persons, going with their Beads in their Hands, and praying in all places without ceasing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bonzies</HI> Sects differ amongst themselves.</NOTE>Moreover, the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> according to their several Sects, wear different Ap∣parel; some going in Black, others in Gray; between which two, great Con∣tests and Quarrels oftentimes arise.

They erect Scaffolds in every corner of the City, according to the number of Handicrafts-men; when the day is come, the multitudes flock together, no otherwise than to a great Feast, fifteen, or sometimes twenty Wag∣gons cover'd with rich Silk Clothes lead the way, every one of which is drawn by forty Men. In every Waggon sits a great number of Youths, singing and playing on Drums or Pipes; the Men and Women of every several Trade or Company, buy their own Waggon: Soon after, more Waggons follow with Arm'd Men, in like manner cover'd with Silk Clothes, on which are Painted the Valiant Exploits and Noble Atchievements of antient <HI>Japan Hero's.</HI> This Train passes along slowly by their Temple: Against the Evening, two Sedans are brought out of the Temple, in one of them sits the Idol whom they Wor∣ship, and in the other his Consort: The bearers of the first Sedan seem'd to swoon under it, being so exceedingly oppress'd by the presence of the God-head; but soon after appears the Sedan in which the Idols Goddess sits, she being ad∣vised by Messengers, that her Husband comes to meet her with his Concubine, the bearers of the Sedan run to and again like Distracted Persons, by which they express the great sorrow which the Goddess receives by her just anger for the Idol her Husbands Adultery; and whilst the bearers of the Sedan run thus madly up and down, the People cry aloud after them, pittying the condition of the Goddess, comforting and Praying to her on their bended Knees: At last, the three Sedans are brought together, and are set down in their Temple, which done, <HI>Gibbon's</HI> Feast ends.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Japan</HI> Wrestlers.</NOTE>¶ BUt besides these strange Customs belonging to their Religion, the <HI>Japan∣ners</HI> have also several bodily Exercises, amongst which, Wrestling is none of the meanest: The place wherein they Wrastle is surrounded with a square Rail, about which the Spectators stand, and look over it, reaching up to their middle; on a Hillock, under a square Roof, supported by four Pillars, the Judge of the Field hath his Seat: The Wrestlers put their Hair under a Net, made in the fashion of a Cap, which they draw close, and make fast on the Crown of their Heads, from whence hangs a small String over their Backs; their Bodies from the middle upward are quite Naked, onely about their sides and Backs they wear a Copper Plate, with the Emperors Arms Ingraven there∣on, open on their Breasts, and made fast about their Middle with two Cords; the like kind of Plates they tie also on their Skins; their Breeches are ty'd up betwixt their Legs with two Strings made fast to the Plates.

<P>It may not be contradicted, but that the <HI>Japanners</HI> have the same intention in these Exercises, as formerly the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> had, which was to make them expert in War, and accustom their bodies to labor;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Art.

The same depth hath the inner Moat, but wants a hundred and forty in breadth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who made the Castle <HI>Osacca</HI> so big, and why.</NOTE>None hath bestowed more Cost and Charges towards the building of this Castle, making it the eighth wonder of the World, than the Emperor <HI>Taicosama,</HI>
<PB N="299" REF="183"/>who falling sick in <HI>Fissima,</HI> troubled himself exceedingly for his young Son <HI>Fideri,</HI> his sole design being to settle him in the Throne, and make him Mo∣narch of the <HI>Japan</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>Amongst many other cunning and subtile Inventions to bring the fore∣mention'd Design to pass, he caus'd the Castle of <HI>Osacca</HI> to be made much larger, and more invincible; whilst his Sickness grew daily to a greater heighth, he set thousands at work to finish this new Structure. Within the Walls stood above seventeen thousand Houses, which in three days time were all pull'd down: the Rubbish every one was commanded, on forfeiture of their Goods, to carry away in four and twenty hours: Those whose Houses were pull'd down, had Ground provided in a spacious Field to build on, according to the Marks made by Surveyors in a direct Line. The new City went on with no less speed than the enlarged Castle, about which <HI>Taicosama</HI> was exceedingly concern'd, sending Messenger after Messenger to forward the Work.</P>
<P>He had by this time chosen five Councellors of State, who with <HI>Ongoschio</HI> should be Guardians of <HI>Fideri,</HI> binding them all by Oath, That when <HI>Fideri</HI> came to be fifteen years old, they should Crown him Emperor; but because his Decease might occasion some Insurrection, the <HI>Japan</HI> Kings being ambiti∣ous of higher Authority, he thought if convenient to get them out of their own Provinces, and by securing so disenable them; to which purpose the Castle in <HI>Osacca</HI> was the most convenient Place, whether they were commanded to remove their Courts from <HI>Fissima.</HI> The Charges of so great a removal were born by <HI>Taicosama.</HI></P>

<P>The chiefest Fortifications have on their Out-points large Towers three Stories high made of Stone; two of the Stories have peculiar Roofs, that jet over the Walls; but the uppermost is smaller: yet the Chambers are very pleasant and convenient to discover any Enemy at great distance.</P>

<P>Adjoyning to this appears another Inlet, not so long as the first, yet adorn'd with several large Fabricks, though inferior to the other in beauty.</P>
<P>Above this lesser Court the out-Wall hath two Indentings; in the last stands a square Platform, with a very strong and neat Watch-house; from the Plat∣form a Wall runs direct against the Breast-work, which goes through the Moat, rising in heighth from the Out-works to the second Gate;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Front-Gate.</NOTE> which is not much unlike the first, and looks inwardly on a square Plain, inclos'd within a Wall, having on the left-side a <HI>Corps de Guarde</HI> close by the Wall, and on the right a a high Turret on the Breast-work.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ware-houses.</NOTE>Over the Bridge next the Wall, stand two Store-houses, the one bigger than the other: on the sides of which a Wall runs cross, beginning at the outward Fortification, and ends against the inclosure of the inner Moat.</P>
<P>Not far from the Front of the little Store-house are two opposite Gates, to which you go betwixt two Stone-Walls, one rais'd against the inner Trench, the other parts three by-Ways from the common Road between the two Gates.

Then leaving <HI>Swria</HI> on their Star-board, they Sail'd along the Shore, and pass'd by <HI>Takessima, Akas, Firmensi,</HI> and <HI>Muro,</HI> where they Landed in their Journey, and after having been nobly Treated in the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Baths.</NOTE> they refresh'd themselves by going to a Bath, much esteem'd and us'd by the <HI>Japanners,</HI> as formerly by the <HI>Jews, Greeks, Persians, Romans,</HI> and several other Nations; and chiefly the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And also the <HI>Romans.</HI></NOTE> who set a great esteem upon their Baths, in <HI>Rome</HI> being an incredible number of them; so that there were not onely publick Baths, but scarce any one Person of Quality but had one for his own Conveniency; and if the Baths any where decay'd, or grew foul, Officers were appointed for their cleansing.</P>
<P>Afterwards, the Emperors spent great Sums of Money on their Baths, and the more, because the <HI>Romans</HI> had great need of them, they having little Lin∣nen to shift themselves withal; so that they had them not onely for Pleasure, but also for Necessity, to wash off their Sweat, and other gather'd Dirt; the bottoms and Walls of those Baths were generally anointed with Perfumes, the Water coming into some of them through Silver and Golden Pipes.</P>
<P><HI>Marcus Agrippa</HI> built an hundred and seventy Baths, all which were free for any one to Bathe in, but not in the night. The Emperor <HI>Adrianus</HI> command∣ed that none should Bathe before eight in the Morning, except in time of sick∣ness: <HI>Alexander Severus</HI> took off that <HI>Roman</HI> Law of not Bathing in the Night, and not onely permitted it, but provided Oil for the Lamps in the Baths. <HI>An∣tonius</HI> the Philosopher parted these places, that the Men and Women should not come together: In like manner, amongst the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> the common People were lock'd out of the Noble-mens Baths. But this distinction was not observ'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> who one among another flock'd thither, insomuch, that the Emperor himself often Bath'd amongst the Vulgar Rout, as <HI>Titus Ve∣spasianus</HI> relates. The concourse of the ordinary Baths was sometimes so great, that the Attenders of them being quite tyr'd out, took the Seed of wild <HI>Lupines</HI> (which occasions the Head-ach) throwing it in the Fire, so to drive the multi∣tude from thence, with the stink thereof.</P>

Nicander</HI> reckons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Theriacis.</NOTE> <HI>That there are eight sorts of these Animals, all which have a Sting sticking out of their Tails, wherewith they offend others, and defend themselves.</HI> If, according to the <HI>Arabians,</HI> they wound the upper part of the Body, a Swelling appears, and a continual rising of the Stomach; but if they sting the lower part of the Body, the Belly swells immediately with Wind. If it be a Man that is hurt, he is troubl'd with a continual <HI>Priapismus,</HI> and the Poyson con∣geals in his Groins.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Loci Affect.</HI> lib. 3. on. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Gallen</HI> tells us, <HI>That a Person stung by a Scorpion met him ac∣cidentally, whose whole Body was as cold as Ice, and yet seem'd to drop with Sweat.</HI> This Animal preys on Flies, and sucks up the fattest Moisture of the Earth: And, according to <HI>Aristotle,</HI> is accustom'd to kill their Dams, so soon as they are able to shift for themselves: Yet they are not mischievous and hurtful in all places; for there are some in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> which afford good Food. The sting of a poysonous Serpent is cur'd by a House-Mouse, cut open in the mid∣dle, and laid upon the Wound; and also a roafted Locust, drunk up in Wine; likewise a Barb, and a Crey-fish. Moreover, it is a testimony of Divine Goodness, that a Scorpion, and most of all other Poysonous Creatures, being kill'd, and their Flesh laid raw on the Wound which they made, cures it in a short time: Fasting-spittle hath also a great Operation to dispel this Poyson. The ancient Father <HI>St. Ambrose</HI> relates concerning this Creature,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hoxaem,</HI> lib. 6. cap. 6.</NOTE> <HI>That he kills a Lion, and is himself destroy'd by Pismires.</HI> But to return to our Story.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Battel between the Pismires and Scorpions in the Voyage to <HI>Nange∣saque.</HI></NOTE> ¶IN the Voyage between <HI>Osacca</HI> and <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> it is often seen with great admiration, that a Scorpion being surrounded with an innumerable Army of Pismires, who storm him on all sides, biting his Feet so extremely, that not being able to bear it, nor seeing any way to escape, at last kills himself with his own Sting, running the same into his Head, of which he immediately dies; whereupon they joyn all their Forces to carry him away: In which Work, it is pleasant to behold how they help one another; some shoving the Prey forward with their Feet, while others haul it along with their Mouths, and the remaining part creep under, to bear it on their Backs; always having fresh Supplies, to release those that grow weary.</P>
<P>God represents in this small Animal the exact Image of Vertue; wherefore the Holy Scripture admonishes the Slothful to take Example by them. And indeed their Care is exceeding great; for they make their Nest with so many crooked Entrances, that it is secure from all hurtful Creatures: The Earth which they scrape out, they stop before their Holes, to keep out Rain: These Holes are divided into three Partitions; in one the Males and Females live to∣gether; in another the Females breed up their Young; and the third serves them for their Storehouse, wherein they lay their Provision.</P>
<P><HI>Majolus</HI> relates, <Q>That near <HI>Barleta,</HI> a City in <HI>Terra di Barria,</HI> he found a strange Nest of Pismires, under a great piece of Timber, which being easily
<PB N="303" REF="191"/>taken away, there appear'd a City, with four Corners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">City of Pismires.</NOTE> almost four Foot long, and one and a half broad, lying so direct, as if it had been made straight with a Line; a Street going through the same long-ways, was a Fin∣ger broad, and one deep, made in a Clayie Ground; three lesser Streets also, which came into the foremention'd middle-way, of the same bredth and depth; at one end thereof a Market-place, and at the other end a Stile made of Egg-shells. On the other side of this Pismires City appear'd several deep Pits, so full of Corn, that it lay scatter'd on the Ground about them. Along the Ways the Pismires pass'd to and fro, like the Inhabitants of a Populous Town. Towards the South-West, exactly in the middle of the longest Wall, was the Gate, through which some came in loaded with Corn, others went out empty to fetch their Burdens, the eldest of them creeping before, who also climb the Blades, biting off the Corn, whilst the young ones stand below, and pick every Grain out of the Ear; that which is too heavy for them to carry, they shove before them; those that are empty, make way for those that are loaden; and that the Corn should not sprout, they bite that end that uses to shoot; and if accidentally it happens to be wet, they bring it forth, laying it to dry in the Sun, which is a certain sign of Fair weather. Moreover, they labor continually, resting neither Night nor Day.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. 6. ca. 50. A conceited Passage of the Pismires.</NOTE><HI>Aelian</HI> relates, <Q>That <HI>Cleanthes</HI> once observ'd some Pismires which carried away a dead one to the Hole, from whence it was us'd to come forth when living; and coming before it, stood all still, they belonging to another Hole; upon which, some Pismires that were in the same, came immedi∣ately to the Strangers, and went several times in and out, as about Business of great concern; at last bringing out a rotten Pear, as a Ransom for the dead Prisoner, and a Reward for their Labor, they took the Deceas'd with them, to bury him, as it is very common amongst them. By this Spectacle <HI>Cleanthes</HI> concluded, That Beasts could speak, and especially the Pismires: about which Opinion. <HI>Pythagoras, Cicero, Celsus,</HI> and other Learned <HI>Heathens,</HI> have often held great Disputations.</Q></P>

<P>They chiefly observe when they are unlading a Vessel, if they can find any Crosses, or other Church-Ornaments us'd by the <HI>Catholicks;</HI> for if they find the least of them, the <HI>Dutch</HI> not onely lose their Ship and Goods, but their Lives also.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> use the Pri∣soners after a strange man∣ner.</NOTE>The <HI>Japanners</HI> understanding these their signs, carry'd them to a Brook, where they wash'd off the Dirt from their Faces; which no sooner done, but they saw the Governor of the Town, whom they had Treated aboard, coming toward them with a great Train of Servants, Colours, and Pikes; three stately Sumptre-Horses, being led before. This Company the Sea-men thought were come to Execute them, so that they expected nothing but death; but when drawing near, the chief of the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were set on Horses, and the rest on Stiers, (which the <HI>Japanners</HI> use very much in stead of Horses) and carry'd up into the Countrey.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Travel to <HI>Jedo.</HI></NOTE>They had ridden full two Leagues, when they entreated the <HI>Japan</HI> Gover∣nor to permit them to write a Letter to the Sea-men, that they might stay at Anchor, and wait for their return from <HI>Jedo;</HI> the Governor making no reply to them, commanded their hands to be unty'd, and onely Pinion their Arms together, and leave the Rope about their Necks.</P>
<P>About Sun-set, having rid five-Leagues through bad way, they came into a Village: The Captain, Merchant, and Boys Lodg'd in a Rusticks House, the rest were kept three and three together in other places, and meanly treated.

<PB N="322" REF="199"/>to <HI>Nangesaque:</HI> But all these Sayings could not procure them the least Liberty, for though the old Cords were taken from them, yet new ones were put on; And the Gentleman going away, set a strict Watch about the House, so that they expected nothing but Death the next Morning.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Receive Orders to Write to their Ships.</NOTE>On which, an hour after the Sun was risen, the foremention'd Gentleman came to them prepar'd for a further Journey, bringing along with him an Ink-horn, and a little piece of Paper, commanding them to write to their Vessels, and order them not to stir from thence, but remain there till their re∣turn, which would not be till thirty days; whereupon the Letter was sent containing to this effect:</P>
<P><Q>We were yesterday treacherously betray'd, and already carry'd five Leagues up in the Countrey to make our appearance before the Emperor in <HI>Jedo;</HI> which Journey requires a Moneths time, mean while entertain the <HI>Japanners</HI> with all Civility; take great care of the Ship and Goods, and also send us some Clothes for fear we should want.</Q></P>
<P>The Letter finish'd and deliver'd, they went on in their Journey, the Com∣manders, as before, Riding on Horses, the rest on Oxen: The Captain and the Merchant asking their Companions how they had been entertain'd? reply'd, But meanly, and that they had their old Ropes also exchang'd for new.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Japan</HI> Village full of Boards, with Chara∣cters Engraven thereon.</NOTE>Towards the Evening, having pass'd eight Leagues, they came into a great Village, where at each Corner of the Streets several Boords were nail'd up full of <HI>Japan</HI> Characters, with thirty Golden Knobs round them.

The Noble∣men before mention'd came to comfort the Prisoners, commanding their Landlord to provide store of Meat for them; which accordingly was perfor∣med. But when the Prisoners, after having refresh'd themselves, thought to take some rest, a great number of <HI>Japanners,</HI> each wearing two Swords, came thronging into their Inn: amongst the Men also came store of Women, which did not a little amaze them, expecting every Minute in that barbarous Coun∣trey to be slain; but indeed was to no other end than out of curiosity to view the <HI>Hollanders:</HI> and chiefly the Women took great delight in seeing the Youth <HI>Jacob de Paw;</HI> whom they made to shew his naked Bosom: They came in great numbers till midnight, asking several times if they were <HI>Papists?</HI> making Crosses with their Fingers, pointing towards them that they should kiss and worship them: But the Prisoners slighting seem'd to abhor them: at which the <HI>Japanners</HI> taking great delight, cry'd <HI>Hollande, Hollande.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They desire their Names for a Remembrance.</NOTE>Next Morning came many more to view the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> troubling them very much, by making them write their Names, which they would keep in re∣membrance of them.</P>
<P>Amongst the Spectators were some, who by their fierce angry Looks, and strange Gestures, seem'd to threaten death to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> turning up the Whites of their Eyes, and making a horrible noise; whilst they thought that

<P>Whilst they were in this fear, the Noble-man came in, and bid them be of good cheer, and not trouble themselves about any thing, but prepare for their Journey; and after Dinner Mounting, they went for the most part Westerly through pleasant Valleys, by murmuring Streams, Rice-fields, and several Hamlets, from whence came great numbers that follow'd to see them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rusticks come to see the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Lodge in a small Village.</NOTE></P>
<P>An hour and a half before Night they entred a small Village, having tra∣vell'd six Leagues, where the Captain, Merchant, and two Boys, were Lodg'd in one House together; the rest were quarter'd in other Places; where the Noble-man and Governor of the Village before which their Ship lay, came to Visit them, commanding them to be unty'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are unty'd.</NOTE> and the Ropes to be taken from them, being now assur'd that they were <HI>Hollanders:</HI> whereupon they bowed their Heads down to the Ground, thanking them for so great a Civility. The Governor also shew'd them a Letter yet Seal'd, which they suppos'd to come from their Ketch <HI>Breskins,</HI> and gave them also a Cup of <HI>Japan</HI> Wine. Here the Noble-man also told them his Name, which till then he had kept private, be∣ing call'd <HI>Ontido Consaimondonne;</HI> upon whose departure and the Governors, they order'd their Servants to untie all the rest of them.</P>
<P>The Prisoners thus deliver'd of so great a Burthen, began to take cou∣rage, and hope for a good Event, and also to take their Rest in quiet, whilst great Companies of Spectators came thronging in and out to see them. But about Midnight, the People going home to their several Habitations, they just laid themselves to sleep, when some of the <HI>Japanners</HI> came in Arm'd with two Scymiters and a Quarter-staff, which startled both the Captain and the Mer∣chant out of their Sleep; but being inform'd that they were some of the Watch, they rested all the remaining part of the Night without any disturbance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter from their Ship</NOTE>On the first of <HI>August, Consaimondonne</HI> deliver'd to Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> two small Packs, made up in Mats, with a Letter from his Ship, which advis'd him, that they had receiv'd information by his Letter concerning their carrying away, and the whole Circumstance thereof; on which they thought it con∣venient to Ride a little farther from the Shore.

<P><HI>Consaimondonne</HI> order'd the Captain to answer their Letter, and withall advise them, that <HI>Consaimondonne</HI> had given order to the Villages to furnish them with Rice, fresh Waters, Fish, Wood, and other Necessaries; therefore they might stay without repining at it.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fair City <HI>Fitachi.</HI></NOTE>After they had travell'd six Leagues they came to a great Wall'd City,
<PB N="324" REF="200"/>standing in a most pleasant and delightful Soyl. They could no ways under∣stand the Name of it; but thought it must upon necessity have been <HI>Fitachi,</HI> known to be seated in that Tract of Land. The spacious Streets presented stately Houses, and in the Houses curious Shops.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollanders</HI> are kindly en∣tertain'd,</NOTE>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were at last Lodg'd in a brave House, standing at a Corner of a Street; where <HI>Consaimondonne</HI> came to see them, and gave order to prepare a noble Dinner; and immediately after order'd them to put on those Clothes that were sent them from Aboard in the Straw-Mats.</P>
<P>Thus Clothed, <HI>Consaimondonne</HI> took Captain <HI>Schaep,</HI> the Merchant <HI>Byleveld,</HI> the Pursor <HI>Siward Johnson,</HI> the Gunner <HI>Henry Van Ebsfoord,</HI> and the two Youths with him through the City: and had not the Soldiers clear'd the Way, it had been impossible for them to have pass'd for the great Concourse of People which came flocking from all Corners to see them; so that the whole City out of Novelty was in an uprore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Palace of the King at <HI>Fitachi.</HI></NOTE>Thus being led through many Streets, they came at last into a great Mar∣ket-place, and through a pair of great Gates into a stately Court, with several Avenues, which all came out at a costly Ascent of six Steps, leading into a spa∣cious Hall; where entring, they found a high Table standing in the middle thereof; on which lay two naked Scymiters cross one another. Several <HI>Japan∣ners</HI> sitting in rich Apparel, with their Legs under them, kept Watch there.</P>
<P>Here the foremention'd Governor came to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and order'd them to pull off their Shoes, and immediately after went with him and <HI>Consaimon∣donne</HI> up several broad Steps; then entring into a stately Gallery, very artifi∣cially built, the Governor commanded them to kneel and wait for the Kings coming: Where whilst they stay'd in that posture, they saw several Courtiers richly Habited,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollanders</HI> appear before the King.</NOTE> Saluting and Complementing one another. At last the King appear'd in a very stately Hall at the end of the Gallery; whither the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were conducted and placed right against him one by another. The King, whom they guess'd to be about forty years old, spake to them with no less State than Friendship, <HI>Hollande,</HI> and immediately gave order, that all sorts Flesh, Fish, Fruit, and <HI>Japan</HI>-Wine, should be brought before them. But they, surpriz'd at such abundance of Kindess and great State, could not eat any thing; which <HI>Con∣saimondonne</HI> and the Governor observing, thought that their refraining from their Meat was for fear of being poyson'd; who to clear them of that doubt, went and eat a little of every Dish: at which they also fell to, and drank each of them two Cups of Wine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Entertainment.</NOTE>After Dinner they were remov'd to another part of the Chamber, and pla∣ced next the King: Who ask'd them if they were <HI>Christians?</HI> making Crosses with his Finger, shewing he would have them to imitate him, and kiss and worship the Crosses. Whereupon they signifi'd to his Majesty that they were <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who yearly coming with great Ships, drove a Trade at <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> and brought great Presents to the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor. Mean while each <HI>Hollander</HI> was commanded to drink two Cups of Wine more. No sooner had they drank about, but an antient <HI>Japanner</HI> came out of a Corner, and whispering Capt. <HI>Schaep</HI> in the Ear, said, <HI>Are you</HI> Portuguese, Castilians, French, English, Danes, Switzers, <HI>or</HI> Cretensers? This <HI>Japanner</HI> speaking very good <HI>Portuguese,</HI> Cross'd himself several times also, which he desir'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to perform: But they shew'd by their Behavior that they abhorr'd all Crosses whatsoever. At last the King caus'd the Picture of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> with the Child <HI>Jesus</HI> in her Arms, Engraven in Copper, to be brought before them, to see if they would

worship it; but the <HI>Hollanders</HI> desir'd, if he would suffer them, that they might break it in pieces. Whereupon the King laughing, threw it away, and com∣manded one of his Servants to carry it to another Place: At which the Purser <HI>Sieward Johnson</HI> unbuttoning himself, shew'd his Breast, and the several Wounds which he had gotten at <HI>Ceylon</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> mortal Enemies to the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> at which the King was exceedingly delighted. At last they re∣turn'd back to their Lodgings, where, on the next day, <HI>Consaimondonne</HI> came to Visit them, giving order, that they should have their foul Linnen wash'd; and was ask'd by Captain <HI>Schaep,</HI> When they should go to <HI>Jedo?</HI> He answering <HI>Jedo, Jedo,</HI> pointed on his Fingers, signifying fifteen days; and immediately call'd for a costly Banquet, where they had plenty of Peaches, Apricocks, Apples, Nuts, Venison, Wine, and many other Dainties.</P>
<P>These Entertainments lasted till the twelfth of <HI>August,</HI> when in the Night a strange noise awak'd the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> not without being much frighted thereat: for a <HI>Japan</HI> Secretary watch'd over them in their Chamber; who being call'd, went out, but soon returning, wak'd them all, and bid them put on their Clothes, and wash themselves. In an instant the whole House was all in a hurry, the Men and Maid-Servants being all busie, sweeping of Chambers, shaking out Mats, and sprinkling their Halls with Water. The amazed <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> ask'd their Watch, what those kind of Preparations in the Night might signifie? Whereupon they were answer'd, That some Ladies and Persons of Quality were coming to see them, which satisfi'd them a little, sitting up three hours by as many great Wax-Candles. Then the King of <HI>Fitachi</HI> entring the Chamber nodded to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and sitting down, commanded Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> and the Merchant to play on the Tables, which they had made to pass away their time withall; and whilst they were busie about their Game, two <HI>Japan</HI> Knights, accompany'd with a <HI>Bonzi,</HI> entred the Chamber.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habit of the <HI>Japan</HI> Knights.</NOTE>The upper Coats which they wore (by them call'd <HI>Korrekorre</HI>) were of seve∣ral Colours, very richly embroider'd; underneath which hung another, on the

Their Breeches exceed∣ing long, trail'd after them on the Ground; and also in their going they trod upon them: Their Scymiters very great, hung on their left sides; of which the Handles being at least two Foot long, were cover'd with Gold Wyre, and in-laid with Precious Stones; the Scabbards also richly Embroider'd: Their Heads all shaven, except one tuft of Hair, left in the nape of their Necks.

What they were freighted with? Why they came so much to the Northward from their Coast? Moreover, Whether any of them understood the <HI>Portuguese</HI> of <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongues? Amongst the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> were some that spoke <HI>Portuguese;</HI> but they thought it better not to ac∣knowledge it, so to prevent further Examinations: Therefore speaking no∣thing but <HI>Dutch,</HI> they told him, <HI>That they set Sail from</HI> Batavia <HI>to</HI> Ternata, <HI>and from thence steer'd their Course to</HI> Tayoan; <HI>but being overtaken by a great Storm out of the South-west, they were driven to the Northward, and after four Months hapned to come to an Anchor in a</HI> Japan <HI>Haven, there to refresh themselves; which they were indeed forc'd to, most of their Seamen being sick.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> understood plainly, that they took them for <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> but such as no way concern'd the <HI>East-India</HI> Company; and that many of them had been formerly sent from <HI>Micau,</HI> or the <HI>Manillas,</HI> with Priests to <HI>Japan.</HI></P>

Soon after, a large Table was cover'd, and fill'd with all manner of Varieties: The Cups with Wine going freely from one to another, and their good Journey being also drank round, the Captain and the Merchant went each into a Sedan, and their other Men mounted on Horses, having Paper-Cloaks given them to keep off the Rain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ferrying over, and Entertainment.</NOTE>After having rode four Leagues, they came to a quick Stream, which be∣tween two pleasant Shores flows with a great swiftness: Along the way which led towards the Ferry stood several Crosses, on which hung divers Men, after a most horrible manner; some being Rack'd, others run through with Spears, others had their Bones broken, and all died lingering Deaths, Being all Fer∣ried over, and Landed on the opposite Shore, they entred into a delightful Village, where they staid and din'd after a Princely manner.

The Women sit with their Legs across under them: On the top of their Heads is a black Paper Roll, from whence falls a long Scarf over their Backs: Their Tunicks, with Embroider'd Collars, are open before, betwixt which space appears a pleited Girdle: In their Hands they hold two Sticks, plated over with Copper, on which they play ve∣ry curiously. Behind the Women sit Men, on high Stools, with their Legs across: These are also cloth'd in short upper Vests, open before; their under Garment made all of one piece; their Breeches hanging over their Feet; their Doublets tied about them with two pleited Girdles, one about their Breasts under their Arms, and the other about the Waste; in the lowermost stick their Swords: They hold in each Hand a Whip, the Ends whereof being tied together, have a hollow Block, with Bells in the middle, which waving to and again over their Heads, makes a noise pleasing to their Ears, keeping Time with their Feet on the Stool. On both sides of the Women that sit, others stand bare-headed: Over their right Shoulder lungs a broad Belt, to which, coming under their left Arm, a round Wheel with Copper Bars is made fast, which they turn with their right Hands by an Iron Handle, whilst they strike with the other on the Bars with a Bell, to which Musick they dance very neatly.

Thus being carried to the Commander <HI>Sicungodonnes</HI> House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How entertain'd there.</NOTE> into a stately Hall, after a lit∣tle stay, they were led into a Princely Chamber, where fitting down a while, they were afterwards commanded to draw near <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> and <HI>Sabrosaimon∣donne:</HI> Both shewing a friendly Countenance, said, <HI>O Hollande.</HI> Next to them sat the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> an Apostate Priest, which had accompanied the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> from <HI>Namboe.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Are examin'd about their Journey.</NOTE>This <HI>Bonzi,</HI> by the command of the two Lords, question'd them, <HI>From what Place they put to Sea, and whither they intended to Sail?

The <HI>Hollanders</HI> mixing broken <HI>Japan, Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> together, answer'd them to most of their Questions: Then the <HI>Spaniard</HI> fetching a Map of <HI>India,</HI> commanded the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> to shew them their Voyage in it, <HI>viz.</HI> both what they had already Sail'd, and did intend; which being perform'd, they receiv'd each two Cups of Wine, and leave to depart.</P>
<P>On the next day all the <HI>Hollanders</HI> appear'd before the same Lords; and whilst they stood in the foremention'd Hall, the Lords being not ready to come forth, they saw several <HI>Japanners,</HI> which also came thither for Audience;
<PB N="331" REF="203"/>amongst which, were two which spoke very good <HI>Portuguese,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Japanners</HI> seek ac∣quaintance with the <HI>Hol∣landers.</HI></NOTE> and said that they were Merchants, and liv'd in <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> that they knew Mr. <HI>Elsrake, Overt∣water,</HI> and other <HI>Netherlanders</HI> in their Store-house on the Island <HI>Disma;</HI> asking them also, if none of them could speak <HI>Portuguese;</HI> and, if they had no ac∣quaintance with those Persons which they had nam'd? The <HI>Hollanders</HI> signi∣fied to them, That they were not experienc'd in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Tongue; but that they had seen <HI>Elsrake</HI> and <HI>Overtwater</HI> in <HI>Batavia.</HI> These Merchants seem'd to be much concern'd at the trouble into which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had brought themselves.</P>
<P>After they had thus waited two Hours, came the Secretaries belonging to <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> accompanied with some <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Priests, which had apostatiz'd from the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are anew examin'd.</NOTE> These inquir'd again concerning their Voyage, asking them also what they intended to do in the Bay of <HI>Namboe?</HI> In what Latitude the Inlet lay? Which they a second time shew'd them in the Chart that they brought, according to which, it lay in thirty nine Degrees; That they lost their Admiral in the Night, before an unknown Countrey, in a dreadful Storm; and that afterwards they endeavor'd to get up to <HI>Nange∣saque,</HI> but through contrary Winds were driven to the Northward.</P>
<P>During this Discourse, Captain <HI>Schaep,</HI> the Merchant, and the Youth, were led to a spacious Gallery from the other People, where <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> and <HI>Sabro∣saimondonne</HI> sat in State, having just before been busie about Trying of Priso∣ners for their Lives: But being set down before the two Lords, they were ask'd nothing of any consequence; only each of them being commanded to drink a Cup of Wine, they had leave to return to their Lodgings. In their going out, they saw in an open Court of the Palace four old, yet strong Se∣dans, made very fast round about; in each of them sat a Prisoner,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Roman</HI> Priests Prisoners.</NOTE> being <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> Fathers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Passage which frighted the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></NOTE>But the remaining seven of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> which were examin'd by the foremention'd Priests, were not a little afraid: For whilst they sat there, two great Chests of <HI>Portuguese</HI> Coats, Clokes, Surplices, Books, Writings, and also Iron Hand-cuffs, Fetters, Chains, and other Instruments for Torture, were brought into the Hall; every one of them judging, that they were fetch'd thither on purpose for them; being ask'd also, at that very instant, if they were not <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> This their fear was the more augmented, because the <HI>Hollandeas</HI> had scarce rested half an Hour in their Lodging, but they were commanded by <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> to return again to the Court; by which they judg'd, that the condemn'd Priests had accus'd them of something that might be prejudicial to them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> deal severely with four <HI>Jesuits.</HI></NOTE>Entring the Palace, they found the Executioners busie in torturing four <HI>Je∣suits,</HI> of which, according as they guess'd, the youngest might be forty, the other fifty, sixty, and seventy years old: They were Habited after the <HI>Japan</HI> manner, yet might easily be distinguish'd from them. The Executioners us'd them very barbarously, lock'd their Hands in Iron Cuffs; their Feet they load∣ed with weighty Chains, and Pinion'd them up in such a manner, that they could not stir one Limb.</P>
<P>This Sight did not a little terrifie the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who were again strictly examin'd concerning their Voyage; and chiefly the <HI>Spanish</HI> Priest which came with them from <HI>Namboe,</HI> ask'd, <HI>If their Ship</HI> Breskens <HI>had not taken in some</HI> Por∣tuguese <HI>Priests, either at the</HI> Manilla's <HI>or</HI> Macau, <HI>and put them on Shore in the Bay of</HI> Namboe <HI>at unseasonable hours?

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Names, Age, and Offices of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are written down.</NOTE>Then the <HI>Hollanders</HI> return'd again to their Quarters, where at Night they were visited by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Priest, and two Commission'd Lords, which were to write down every Man's Name, Age, and Office; so that they writ down in a Book <HI>Henry Cornelison Schaep</HI> Captain, aged thirty two years; <HI>William Byleveld</HI> Merchant, four and twenty; <HI>Sieuward Johnson</HI> Purser, thirty three; <HI>Peter Gerritson</HI> Cooper, twenty six; <HI>Abraham Pieterson Spelt</HI> Gunner, twenty two; <HI>Henry Elsford</HI> Mate, twenty; <HI>Jurian Sholten,</HI> also his Mate, twenty seven; <HI>Hans Slee</HI> Boatswain, twenty; <HI>Aert Bastianson</HI> a Youth, fifteen, and <HI>Jacob de Paw,</HI> a Boy of fourteen years old.</P>

They told them moreover, that there were two <HI>Dutch</HI> Interpreters coming from <HI>Firando</HI> to Interpret for them before the Magistrates, who would for that purpose be in <HI>Jedo</HI> within thirty days; at last telling them, that they should Lodge in the House with a Priest that had apostatiz'd from the <HI>Christian Religion;</HI> yet they should no ways be daunted, for there was not the lead danger in their Concern; and they ought the less to fear, because they assur'd them of the Lords <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> and <HI>Sabrosai∣mondonnes</HI> Favors, and <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> had given order to their Landlord, that he should not let them want for any thing.

<P>Close by the City is a great Palace about the bigness of a small City, which entring, after having past several Avenues, they came before a dismal and dark Prison; before the Grates of which the four condemned <HI>Jesuits</HI> sat loaden with great Fetters and Chains, with some other <HI>Japan Christians;</HI> from thence they were conducted into a spacious open Court, in which stood Gibbets, Crosses, Gallows, and great Wells full of Water. The Place swarm'd with People, and chiefly one Leaded Entry Pav'd with Free-stone, was continually full of all manner of Courtiers, private Officers, Executioners and Hang-men, which passed to and again, expecting Commands. At last the <HI>Jesuits</HI> and the <HI>Japanners</HI> were brought out of their Dungeon, to come before the chief Magistrate of <HI>Japan.</HI> And whilst the Judges were busie in examining them, most part of the Day was spent: Mean while the <HI>Hollanders</HI> stood in the open Court next the Guards, which had brought them from their Inn thither, where they saw all Passages; and that they might not faint in so great a Crowd, they had Sweet∣meats given them to eat; which they judg'd was by <HI>Sicungodonne's</HI> order. At last they were led through a small Gate, to a very pleasant Place, having on one side a Woodden Gallery cover'd with Mats; through which passing and entring into a Princely Hall, they were commanded to kneel before <HI>Sicungo∣donne,</HI> sitting on a high Throne surrounded with a great number of Councel∣lors, who by the Interpreters ask'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> these following Questions:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Questions ask'd the <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI> to which they re∣turn Answers,</NOTE>From whence, whither, and when they put to Sea? Why they Anchor'd in the Haven <HI>Namboe?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> answer'd, That they set Sail the third of <HI>February, Anno</HI> 1643. from the Road before <HI>Batavia,</HI> and steer'd their Course towards <HI>Ternata,</HI> from whence they weighed Anchor the fourth of <HI>April;</HI> but afterwards driven by great Storms, were necessitated to Anchor in the Haven <HI>Namboe.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> ask'd them if they were <HI>Christians,</HI> though no <HI>Papists?</HI> If they did not desire to speak with the four <HI>Jesuits</HI> in private?</P>
<P>Their Answer hereupon was, That they were <HI>Christians,</HI> but no <HI>Papists;</HI> and
<PB N="334" REF="205"/>believe in one God, Creator and Governor of Heaven and Earth; for which Religion they were ready to die; and had nothing to say to the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> but held them for their greatest Enemies.</P>
<P>The other Questions which they were ask'd were these following:</P>
<P>How many <HI>Netherlanders, Chineses,</HI> and others, liv'd in <HI>Batavia?</HI> Where their Governor kept his Court? How many Ships hath he in his Service? What Places do they Sail to? Do all manner of Artificers live in <HI>Batavia?</HI> Do Shoe∣makers, Taylors, Weavers, and other Handicrafts reside there?</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> told them, That there liv'd about twelve hundred <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI> in <HI>Batavia,</HI> besides three thousand <HI>Chineses,</HI> and a considerable number of <HI>Malabars, Javans, Bandaneesen, Amboiners,</HI> and <HI>Mardikers,</HI> and also all manner of Handicrafts, resided in the City: but the number of the Ships which Sailed to <HI>Persia, Ceylon, Cormandel, Malacca, Siam, Molucco-Islands, Tayoan,</HI> and other Places from <HI>Batavia,</HI> was unknown to them.</P>
<P>They were also ask'd, If the <HI>Hollanders</HI> saw any way by which they might Conquer <HI>Nangesaque,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Are silent in one Que∣stion.</NOTE> as they had done <HI>Quilang?</HI> But making as if they under∣stood them not, this Question was not answer'd.</P>
<P><HI>Sicungodonne</HI> enquir'd of them also, Why their Ketch <HI>Breskens</HI> had fir'd her Guns several times in the Haven of <HI>Namboe,</HI> which had frighted the Fisher∣men, and all the Countrey People thereabouts? Also if they had not a Mini∣ster aboard?</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> acknowledg'd, That the hady fir'd with bare Powder on the intreaty of some <HI>Japan</HI> Gentlemen which came Aboard of them to view the Ship; and that they had not the least intentions to scare the People, which they not once thought of, being accustom'd to do the same before <HI>Firando,</HI> when any Gentlemen desir'd it: but out of fear they deny'd that they had a Minister Aboard.</P>
<P>At last they were ask'd if they could not swim, as they had seen many <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> do at <HI>Nangesaque?</HI></P>
<P>This Question amaz'd them much, not knowing why they should ask it; yet they reply'd, That some could swim, and others not.</P>
<P><HI>Sicungodonne</HI> leaving off to make any farther Examination, gave the <HI>Hollanders</HI> leave to go to their Lodgings; where they rested till the three and twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> without any farther molestation. Then the Secretary told them, that their Landlord was gone to the Lord <HI>Sicungodonne</HI>'s House, to ask for some Clothes for them, because the cold Weather began to pinch, and they were us'd to go warm Cloth'd.</P>
<P><HI>Sicungodonne</HI> promis'd to furnish them with Coats. He also signifi'd, that the imprison'd <HI>Jesuits</HI> and <HI>Japanners,</HI> not being able to endure the exquisite Tor∣tures, had deny'd <HI>Christianity.</HI></P>
<P>The next day the Interpreters <HI>Kitsbioye</HI> and <HI>Fatsiosaimon,</HI> with the Renegado Priest <HI>Siovan,</HI> came and brought for every <HI>Hollander</HI> two <HI>Japan</HI> Coats made of Cotton by <HI>Sicungodonne</HI>'s Order. Which kindness the <HI>Hollanders</HI> knew not how to return sufficient thanks for.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A new fear arises amongst them.</NOTE>Mean while understanding by some of the Servants, that the next day they were to appear before some of the Magistrates, they were exceedingly afraid, and the more, because they very well knew the two <HI>Dutch</HI> Interpre∣ters expected from <HI>Firando,</HI> could not yet be come to <HI>Jedo.</HI> And whilst they sorrowfully sate considering of these Matters, the Walls of the House be∣gan to shake, the Timber to crack, the Roofs to rent, the Doors and Windows
<PB N="335" REF="205"/>flying open, and the Ground to move under them: At which the <HI>Japanners</HI> signifi'd to them, that a horrible Sea-Monster struck his Tail so vehemently against the Shore, that he made all things to shake and tremble.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Japanners</HI> Opinion concerning Earthquakes is antient.</NOTE>But under this kind of ignorance seems to lie hid the antient Opinion of some <HI>Greek</HI> Philosophers, which gave to <HI>Neptune</HI> the Name of <HI>Ennosigaeus,</HI> that is, <HI>A shaker of the Earth,</HI> because it creeps into the Crevices thereof, and breaks the Foundations with its swelling Waters.</P>
<P>This Opinion <HI>Thales</HI> and <HI>Democritus Abderita</HI> affirm'd with these Arguments, <HI>viz.</HI> Because that in Earthquakes new Fountains often broke forth, and great Places lay hid under almost fathomless Lakes and Plashes of Water.</P>
<P>But others with much more seeming Reasons attribute tke Earthquakes to the Winds inclos'd in the Caverns of the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Agellius</HI> puts both the said Reasons together; <HI>Who are not,</HI> saith he,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nost. A. A.</HI> l. 2. c. 19.</NOTE> <HI>sufficiently instructed by Nature, whether the shakings and gapings of the Earth are occasion'd by the power of imprison'd Winds, or inclos'd Waters, swelling within the Earth:</HI> Wherefore the <HI>Romans</HI> order'd a solemn Day of Humiliation to be kept, when any great Earthquakes happen'd; but they express'd not of what God they sought for help, because they knew not whether it were <HI>Aeolus,</HI> Commander of the Winds, or <HI>Neptune,</HI> Lord of the Seas, that shook the World.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> are much ter∣rifi'd at an Earthquake.</NOTE>The <HI>Japanners</HI> are exceedingly terrifi'd at Earthquakes, knowing by dear Experience, that Mountains have sunk into deep Pits, Villages turn'd topsie∣turvey, Cities and whole Territories swallow'd up; therefore when the inner parts of the Houses began to crack, the Walls to totter, the Mats which cover'd the Floors to move, and other Houses here and there began to tumble, every one ran to seek for a Place of safety, their amazedness was so exceeding great; which indeed was no wonder; for who would not be afraid when the firm Earth affords no sure Foot-steps? when it falls in under Towns and Villages? An enemy may be repuls'd by high Bulwarks, and inaccessible Ways; against great Storms, Harbors are sure Guards; Fire follows not those which flye from it; raging Sickness, though it empties Cities, yet swallows them not up: but the Earthquakes hide oftentimes under heaps of Rubbish, or almost bottomless Pits, Mountains, Cities, nay, whole Territories, without leaving the least Mark behind; so that whole Generations of People are buried with the Ruines of their Habitations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were less afraid.</NOTE>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> seem'd to be less afraid than any, because they not onely knew of their Mortality in what Place soever they were, but that they might easily suffer an involuntary Death, not yet knowing how they should come off, but that they were at the pleasure and dispose of a barbarous Nation. It would be no great matter of difference to them, if some merciful <HI>Japanner</HI> (if such a one might be found any where) cover'd their Bodies with Earth, or if the Earth it self perform'd the Office: for without doubt they should suffer a far more easie Death under than upon the Earth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange alteration in <HI>Japan</HI> by an Earthquake.</NOTE>Most part of the Evening this Trepidation continu'd, onely giving several shakes: for at other times <HI>Japan</HI> feels greater sorrow by these Earthquakes, because it often happens there, that the Earth sinks, or makes terrible gapings, Rivers swelling overflow, cooling hot Springs, and making hot cold; that Flames break forth from the Mountains, or on the contrary, that burning Mountains are quenched by Earthquakes; that plain Countreys become Moun∣tains, and Mountains turn into Plains; that Islands are blown up out of the Sea, and others sink under Water.</P>
<PB N="336" REF="206"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The reasons of Earth∣quakes descrid d after di∣vers manners.</NOTE>We must acknowledge it to be a great Wisdom, which is not onely satisfi'd by the outward appearance of such horrible Motions, but also searches into the Secrets of Nature, to find out the Reasons of such Trepidations. The <HI>Ja∣panners</HI> (as we said before) ascribe it to the Water, or rather (according to their Custom and idle Fancies) to a Sea-Monster. But those that ascribe it to the Water, differ in their Opinions: Some maintain (according to <HI>Thales Milesius</HI>) that the Earth swims upon the Sea, and is moved by it almost like a Ship. Others say, That the Earth is cut through by continual flowing Streams, by immense Lakes, inhabited round about by a People which know not one ano∣ther, and by Fountains that never cease to spout forth Waters through undisco∣verableble Springs, which all have their original under the Earth, and either flow gently there, or else descend into some deeper Caves, and gather together again in several Places, by which means swelling they lift up the upper Grounds, so shaking the Earth, and all that which it bears.</P>
<P>But <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> makes Fire to be one reason of Earthquakes; so that the Fire hath the same operation in the Earth as in the Air, when it drives the Clouds and rents them with Thunder. Amongst the Modern Philosophers some are of Opinion, That the dreadful gapings and <HI>Hiatus</HI> of Earth is occa∣sion'd by Fire, not unlike a Myne, in which Powder being laid and set on Fire, blows up the Earth, according to the Invention which the <HI>Biskainer, Peter Na∣verius,</HI> being taught by <HI>Francis George</HI> of <HI>Scenen,</HI> try'd first upon the Castle <HI>Ovi,</HI> close by <HI>Naples.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> also saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lip. 2. c. 79.</NOTE> That the shaking of the Earth is like Thunder in the Air. Moreover, it cannot be deny'd, but that the Earth feeds. Fire under it, which appears by the continual Smoak, and sometimes by the Flames which ascend the Skie from several Mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burning of Mountains.</NOTE> whereof <HI>Vesuvius</HI> in <HI>Italy; Aetna,</HI> in <HI>Sicily;</HI> in <HI>Island Hecla,</HI> and in <HI>Japan, Siurpurama,</HI> lying eight Leagues beyond <HI>Meaco,</HI> near the great Lake <HI>Meacosche,</HI> are sufficient testimonies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason of the sinking of Cities.</NOTE>It is not therefore improper which some believe, That the sinking of Cities and Countreys proceeds from the Earths being consum'd by the Fire, which requires Food; not unlike a House, which (the Pillars and other Timber being devour'd by Flames) wanting Supporters tumbles down.</P>
<P>Some also hold, that the Fire in the Earth produces continual Smoak, which finding no Vent, forces and breaks its way out; so that if the Smoak be very strong, it rents and cleaves the Earth asunder; but if it be weak, it causeth onely a shaking of the upper Grounds.</P>
<P>But <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> judges the Earth it self to be the reason of her own unfirm∣ness; for he saith that it is nothing without which moves it, but great Pieces within falling, either loosned by moisture, or consum'd by Fire; or the Winds which rage under Ground, blown down, or else being decay'd by Age, like an old Building, of which the Foundation being rotted, and not able to bear the Superstructure, tumble down. These Pieces are the great occasion often∣times of a general sinking, or at least, a shaking of the upper Grounds, by the blow which they give in the fall.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Winds the reasons of Earthquakes.</NOTE>This Opinion is contradicted by <HI>Archelaus, Aristotle, Theophrastus,</HI> and most of the chief and Learnedst <HI>Geographers,</HI> which ascribe the Reason of Earthquakes to the Winds, <HI>viz.</HI> The Earth produces always Mists, either dry or moist, which rise so high up into the Air, that not able to get farther, they descend again, and creep into all the Crevises of the Earth, which when they have fill'd up, and the one Wind seems to force in upon another, makes it seek for Vent:
<PB N="337" REF="206"/>which kind of striving occasions those violent Emotions oftentimes bursting open, and swallowing up all that is on the top.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Opinions con∣cerning it.</NOTE>Yet some are of another Opinion concerning the Winds, judging that it is with them as with a humane Body, which is moistned by Blood, and mov'd by the Spirits or Vitals, which get in and out by some little Pores, but gather in far greater Places, so long as the Body is of a good Temper, the Pulses beat temperate: But if it meets with any stoppage inwardly, then the Breath is stopp'd and troubled, and sometimes strange Convulsions produced; so like∣wise the Winds in the Earth being molested, and wanting Vent, make a rum∣bling and terrible motion, till at length they force out their way.</P>
<P>It hath often been observ'd by the <HI>Japanners,</HI> that the greatest Earthquakes have happen'd in calm Weather when the Winds are shut up into the bosom of the Earth.</P>
<P>But amongst all others (according to our Judgment) the famous Philoso∣pher <HI>Epicurus</HI> seems to come nearest the truth, who is of Opinion, That Earth∣quakes may proceed from the falling of the Earth into deep Pits, or its consu∣ming by Fire, whether the sulphurous Grounds occasion the Flame, or whe∣ther a collection of fiery Spirits changes into Fire, and breaks forth like Light∣ning, or inclosed Winds have the greatest force.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Dutch</HI> Prisoners in <HI>Jedo</HI> were not so much in fear for the Earth∣quake, as for a far more terrible Death than to be kill'd by the fall of a House; for they knew the <HI>Japanners</HI> cruelty: neither could they expect any good in their preparation, being order'd to come before some of the Council; so that they spent the whole Night with melancholly thoughts without sleeping; yet in the Morning the Earthquake and their fear ceased both on a sudden, at their coming the Interpreters <HI>Kitsbioie</HI> and <HI>Phatsiosaimon,</HI> who brought them informati∣on of the occasion of their being commanded to come forth that day, was only to return the Council thanks for the Presents of <HI>Japan</HI> Coats; and accordingly the Interpreters conducting the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to the Presidents Palace, they made humble returns of their thanks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange dealings of the Councellors with the <HI>Hol∣landers.</HI></NOTE>But the Councellors delighted themselves with asking the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> If they knew not where their Ship <HI>Breskens</HI> was at that present time, having weighed Anchor, and was gone from the Haven <HI>Namboe?</HI> If they took the <HI>Roman</HI> Reli∣gion to be the onely true Faith?</P>
<P>Whereupon Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> answer'd, That he did not know whether the Ship was gone to <HI>Batavia, Taiovan,</HI> or <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> and that they abhorr'd the <HI>Papists</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>After this every <HI>Hollander</HI> received two Cups of Wine, which having drank, they were commanded to shew them some antick Postures, to make wry Fa∣ces, and look asquint, to go splay-footed, and swing their Arms to and again, which the <HI>Japan</HI> Lords took great delight to see: when they were at the heighth of their Pleasures they were commanded to depart.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Discourse with the Interpreters.</NOTE>The day after the receipt of this Letter, <HI>Kytsbyoye, Phatsyosamon,</HI> and <HI>Syovan,</HI> being told by <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> That <HI>Elserak</HI> had inform'd the Governor of <HI>Nange∣saque,</HI> that the Council in <HI>Batavia</HI> had fitted out two Ships the third of <HI>February, Anno</HI> 1643. to discover a place of great Trade in <HI>Tartary;</HI> this place being al∣ready known by eminent Writers: And also a Native <HI>Tartar</HI> was in one of the Ships, which would assist in promoting that Undertaking; and <HI>Elserak</HI> believ'd, that <HI>Breskens</HI> was one of those two Vessels. This being told to the <HI>Holland∣ers</HI> by the Interpreters, they acknowledg'd it to be really true; but because they had lost their Admiral <HI>Castrecom</HI> by a Storm in the Night, they did not proceed in their Voyage; and chiefly, because he carried six Tun of Rice for the Ketch <HI>Breskens,</HI> for want of which they were drove to a great strait, and their Provisions growing very short, they concluded either to Sail, if possible, to <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> or <HI>Tayoan,</HI> or else to return back to <HI>Batavia.</HI> This their Resolu∣tion they were not able to perform, being driven by Storm still further and further to the Northward.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Maps, after what manner.</NOTE>¶ WHilst they gave this Account, <HI>Syovan</HI> fetch'd a Map Printed on <HI>Japan</HI>-Paper, like unto a half Globe, which contain'd in a small Circum∣ference the Provinces of <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>Amboyna, Molucco</HI> Islands, <HI>Manilla, The South Sea, Borneo, Celebes, Malacca, Formosa, Corea,</HI> and other Territories lying in that Cor∣ner of the World. They found also in the same Map the Countrey which they lighted upon in forty two Degrees, spreading East-North-East from the North-West part of <HI>Japan,</HI> sixteen Leagues off at Sea: But they could see no Passage that went through betwixt that and <HI>Japan;</HI> so that they took that Coast for
<PB N="339" REF="207"/>the Countrey of <HI>Jesso,</HI> which joyns to <HI>Japan:</HI> For the Inlet betwixt <HI>Sungaer</HI> and <HI>Jesso</HI> washes not through, reaching scarce forty Leagues upwards, being there stopp'd by the Mountains, which spread themselves over the <HI>Japan</HI> Province <HI>Ochio.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of <HI>Jesso.</HI></NOTE>¶ THe Bigness of <HI>Jesso</HI> (full of Mountains and rich Furs) is, as we said before, unknown; notwithstanding the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperors were so much concern'd at the Discovery thereof, that they sent Persons thither on purpose, if possible, to learn how far <HI>Jesso</HI> extends it self: But they travelling over high Mountains, and deep Valleys, a vast way into the Countrey, could find no end, but brought Information to the Emperor, That the Inhabitants were a Wild and Salvage People. So after a toilsom Journey, they were forc'd to return with no Effect.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> found <HI>Jesso</HI> to be in forty seven Degrees, seeming to spread it self a vast Way to the North-East. This Map shewn by <HI>Syovan,</HI> represented <HI>Jesso</HI> to lie a hundred Leagues from <HI>Japan;</HI> notwithstanding it joyns with the Province <HI>Ochio</HI> to <HI>Japan.</HI> Moreover <HI>Jesso</HI> spreads it self so far, that it borders the Northern <HI>America;</HI> so that the <HI>Straights of Anian,</HI> generally by <HI>Geographers</HI> plac'd between <HI>Kataya</HI> or <HI>Kitai,</HI> and the Northern <HI>America,</HI> is not found in the foremention'd Map; and accordingly no Passage from the <HI>Frozen Sea,</HI> into the <HI>South Sea,</HI> which was always held infallible: Wherefore several <HI>Europeans,</HI> and chiefly since the Year 1380. have sought a way by the North, through the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Anian,</HI> to Sail to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The first Undertaker of this, was <HI>Nicholas Zenet;</HI> being afterwards fol∣low'd by <HI>Gaspar Cortez,</HI> who discover'd a new River; and going again a se∣cond time, never return'd.</P>

Yet he was not so satisfied; for Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> took such a liking to <HI>Forbisher</HI>'s Design, that she gave him a Vessel of three hundred and sixty Tuns, with two Ketches, and stor'd them with six Months Provision. The twenty sixth of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 1577. <HI>Forbisher</HI> set Sail from <HI>Harwich:</HI> On one of the Islands of <HI>Orkney</HI> he went ashore, but found all the Inhabitants fled from their Huts, in the middle of which they had their Hearths without Chimneys: On one side were the Peoples Lodgings; on the other, a place for their Cat∣tel; and in a Corner lay some dried Fish, and a few Oats. After having Sail'd six days, since they left the Haven of the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> he met for a whole Month with several great Trees, which without doubt had by extraordinary Floods been wash'd up, and so carried into the Ocean: This was the less dangerous, because he had continual day-light.

They use Bowes, Arrows, Slings, and two sorts of Skiffs, whereof the biggest, carrying seventeen Men, is made of several pieces of Wood joyn'd together, and on both sides cover'd with Lea∣ther: The little ones are also cover'd with Leather, and not unlike a Weavers Shuttle; in the middle of which is a Hole, for one Man to sit, who ties the upper Covering of the Boat about his Middle, and with one Oar makes ex∣ceeding swift way through the Water.</P>
<P>The Soil is very barren of any kind of Fruit or Grain; only it feeds abun∣dance of Deer, Hares, Wolves, Sea-Bears, and Hogs, not unlike a Wolf: The raw Flesh of these Beasts serves the Inhabitants for Food.</P>
<P>It seems that this Countrey is exceedingly troubled with Earthquakes; for in many places were seen pieces of Hills, and in other places whole Moun∣tains, that were strangely rent from one another.</P>
<P>The fourth of <HI>August, Forbisher</HI> returning, came safe on the seventeenth of <HI>September</HI> into <HI>Milford-Haven,</HI> and brought besides his Ballast of glittering Stones, a Salvage Man, his Wife, and Child, who signified so much to them, that the Mans Name was <HI>Calichoe,</HI> the Womans <HI>Egnoge,</HI> and the Childs <HI>Nutive;</HI> yet though notwithstanding they were fed, according to their Custom, with raw Flesh, they liv'd not long after being brought from their Countrey.</P>

They found also very many and large Sea-Calves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea-Calves, what Crea∣tures.</NOTE> being Amphibious Crea∣tures, living both in the Water and on the Land: They have a Mouth like an Ox, out of which stick two Tusks, each half a Yard long, which are ac∣counted as good as Ivory: Their Skins of so great a hardness, that no Sword, Pike, Battel-Ax, or other Weapon whatsoever, can pierce it, nor kill them, un∣less hit in the Temples of the Head.</P>
<P>The time began to expire, when <HI>William Barrenson</HI> Steer'd his Course through the <HI>Waygates,</HI> by him call'd the <HI>Straights of Nassaw,</HI> Sailing close by the Promontories and Capes of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> when he discover'd a Cross, plac'd on a high Point; where Landing, he found several Mens Footsteps, and six Sacks of Rye-Meal: A Musquet-shot further, stood another Cross, by three Houses, built after the manner of the <HI>Norwegians:</HI> In these they saw only some Tubs of Salt Meat.</P>
<P>The fifteenth of <HI>August</HI> the three Ships which had Sail'd more Easterly came to their Admiral <HI>Barrenson,</HI> having been much cumber'd and troubled by the Ice, but since gotten through the <HI>Straights of the Waygates,</HI> and Sail'd sixty Leagues into the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Sea, which was very salt, full of Whales, and the Bottom not to be reach'd by our Line.

<P>Thus having had no better Success for two several Expeditions, the States of the <HI>United Netherlands</HI> prepar'd a third Fleet, promising great Rewards to those that could open a Passage for Ships to sail to <HI>Japan</HI> by the North;
<PB N="342" REF="209"/>at which <HI>Amsterdam</HI> seem'd much concern'd, though nothing had been effected in it: Whereupon they set out two Ships, the biggest of which was Com∣manded by <HI>Hemskerk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His second Expedition.</NOTE> and <HI>William Barrenson</HI> Chief Pylot; and the other, by <HI>Cornelison Riip.</HI> Both of them Sail'd through vast Seas of Ice, to eighty De∣grees, where they discover'd a Grassy Countrey, full of Cartel; whereas <HI>No∣va Zemla,</HI> which lieth seven Degrees more Southerly, hath neither Grass, nor any Cattel, unless Foxes and Bears.

The Ship driving against these Mountains of Ice, receiv'd a great Leak in her Prow. <HI>September</HI> began by this time to come on apace, at which time the Sun begins to hide it self there for three Months: The Place desolate and unhabitable, the Cold insupportable, Firing scarce, no Houses nor Provisions to be found any where; so that they had all expect∣ed Death, had not some of the Seamen travell'd up two Leagues Southerly into the Countrey, where they found a sweet River, full of Trees, and Planks driving in it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is very remarkable.</NOTE> which serv'd them for a Hut, which they built not without great danger of Bears, and exceeding trouble, by reason of the extraordinary Cold; not having finish'd it before the latter end of <HI>October.</HI> After that, they were miserably tormented, within by the Smoke, and without by Bears, North-East Winds, and Mountains of Snow, betwixt which they were forc'd to pass, to carry their Firing into the Hut: Thus they spent their time till <HI>May,</HI> which drawing near an end, and also their Provisions growing scant, they prepar'd their Boats; and though grown weak by their Wants and Suffer∣ings, yet they stood out to the <HI>Offin.</HI> In these Boats they pass'd through the wide Ocean; and when the Waves went too high, they hawl'd them on the Ice, where they were assaulted by the Bears.

The Passages of Ancient Times manifest this suffici∣ently. It cannot be denied, that the spreading of Mankind over the Earth after the Flood, must be sought for on the <HI>Armenian</HI> Mountain <HI>Ararat</HI> (which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Agri Dagh;</HI> and the <HI>Armenians, Messis Saur</HI>) on which <HI>Noah</HI>'s Ark landed.</P>

<P>The Generations of Mankind increasing and multiplying, sought in all places for newer and greater Habitations: Those which sprang up in the North-East, took <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>Catay</HI> into possession, from whence they spread themselves further over <HI>America:</HI> And that this hapned many Ages ago, may appear by those <HI>Europeans</HI> that discover'd <HI>America;</HI> for they found this Coun∣trey, and all the Islands, which lie scatter'd up and down in great numbers, so exceeding Populous, that they might well stand in competition, for the Num∣ber of Inhabitants, with <HI>Europe,</HI> or any other part of the World; but are so different in their Language and Customs, that the one hath not the least re∣semblance with the other; whereby it may partly appear, that as they remov'd their Stations presently after the Confusion of Tongues that hapned in the Valleys of <HI>Shinar,</HI> the Passage from <HI>Catay</HI> to <HI>America,</HI> about the North, is very easie; whereas that from <HI>Norway</HI> thither, is much farther, and more trouble∣som, between Flakes of Ice, and under a Cold Heaven: For no where <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> borders on <HI>Asia,</HI> but near the <HI>Straights of Anian,</HI> if such a Channel were found; but more probably on the Territory of <HI>Catay.</HI> However, the first Plantations of People belong originally to <HI>Asia.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Hollanders</HI> are Exa∣min'd before the Council concerning their Voyage to <HI>Tartary.</HI></NOTE>The next day their long-expected Examination began before <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> in this manner: The Interpreters, <HI>Tosaimon</HI> and <HI>Maniekebe,</HI> propos'd the following Questions by order of <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> to Captain <HI>Schaep,</HI> the Merchant <HI>Bylevelt</HI> and <HI>Jacob de Paw:</HI> When, and with how many Sail did you come from <HI>Ba∣tavia,</HI> and since from <HI>Ternata?</HI> Whether did you design your Voyage? How came your Ship so far to the North? Why did you stand to and again before the East-Coast of <HI>Japan?</HI> and why dropp'd ye Anchor in the Haven of <HI>Namboe?</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Answer.</NOTE>To which they answer'd, We set Sail from <HI>Batavia</HI> on the third of <HI>February, Anno</HI> 1643. and steer'd our Course for <HI>Ternata,</HI> with two Ships call'd <HI>Castrecom</HI> and <HI>Breskens;</HI> the fourth of <HI>April</HI> we weighed <HI>Anchor</HI> from <HI>Ternata</HI> to Sail to <HI>Taiovan,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Tartary,</HI> that there we might discover a Place for Trade, according as we had been inform'd: But Sailing on with this inten∣tion, were driven by a great Storm that happen'd in the Night on an un∣known Coast; after which we lost the Ship <HI>Castrecom,</HI> judging that she may be split against the Rocks; yet we sought for it along the <HI>Japan</HI> Coast, though we had little hopes of finding it: mean while we suffer'd under a great incon∣venience, by reason of the scarcity of our Provisions, because the Ship <HI>Castre∣com</HI> carry'd six Tun of Rice for our Pink, to be put aboard of us when our need should require it; therefore because she could not be found, we were forc'd not to proceed in our Journey for <HI>Tartary,</HI> and according as Wind and Weather would permit to Sail to <HI>Taiovan, Nangesaque,</HI> or <HI>Batavia,</HI> so soon as we were furnish'd with fresh Water, which we had great want of on the East-Coast of <HI>Japan,</HI> and therefore stood directly thither. The tenth of <HI>June</HI> we entred into the Mouth of the Haven <HI>Namboe;</HI> where we came to Anchor, and were courteously receiv'd by the Inhabitants, and instantly furnish'd with what Wa∣ter we requir'd; so that on the next day we stood again to Sea, and steer'd directly Easterly, that we might first Weather the South-East Point of <HI>Japan;</HI> at last we laid it over due West, but by Southern Storms and contrary Cur∣rents were so driven towards the <HI>Japan</HI> Shore, that we fell a whole De∣gree to the Northward from our intended Course, having then according to Calculation, Sail'd about two hundred Leagues from <HI>Namboe:</HI> Thus toss'd by Tempests, and the Vessel requiring necessary repair, and the Seamen weakned by four Moneths endurance on the Offin, and most of them sick, some speedy refreshment was necessary; for obtaining which the Haven <HI>Namboe</HI> was the nearest to Sail to; and having before been kindly entertain'd there, we re∣turn'd thither, but staid with our Sails hal'd back till some of the Inhabitants came to us in Boats; of whom we ask'd leave to Anchor in the Haven be∣fore the Village: which Request was granted by the Chief of the Town; so that upon his leave our Men row'd ashore to fetch him Aboard; who desir'd to barter some of our Merchandise for Provision, of which they had great store.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Questions ask'd the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> by the Council, on which their Answer is re∣quir'd.</NOTE>Moreover <HI>Tosaimon</HI> caus'd them to be ask'd where <HI>Tartary</HI> lay, or the City whither they were sent? and also if ever any <HI>European</HI> Ships Sail'd to those Places for Trade? Whereupon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> answer'd, That to their know∣ledge never any <HI>Europeans</HI> had Sail'd to <HI>Tartary;</HI> and they had likewise no Map
<PB N="346" REF="211"/>nor Chard to direct them thither, but had Orders from the Governor of <HI>Bata∣via,</HI> which was, That when they came beyond the utmost North-part of <HI>Japan,</HI> to steer their Course North-west to forty five Degrees, where the River <HI>Poly∣sange</HI> disembogues into the South-Sea. On the Banks of which River stand the Cities <HI>Brema, Jangio,</HI> and <HI>Cambaley,</HI> all three famous for Traffick; but because they never got to above forty Degrees, they received no other information, neither could they say any more concerning it, but what had been told them in <HI>Batavia,</HI></P>
<P>Their other Questions were these: If they should discover <HI>Tartary,</HI> what would they do to understand the Inhabitants?</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> reply'd That they had three Sea-men Aboard of the Ship <HI>Breskens</HI> that understood and spoke the <HI>Muscovitish</HI> and <HI>Polish</HI> Tongue, which most of the <HI>Tartars</HI> understood: and in the Ship <HI>Castrecom</HI> a Native <HI>Tartar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tosaimon</HI> ask'd, How they came by that <HI>Tartar?</HI> What Age is he? What Office performs he?</P>
<P>The <HI>Russians</HI> (said <HI>Schaep</HI>) making an Inroad into <HI>Tartary,</HI> amongst the Pri∣soners which they took was a Youth, whom they sold to an <HI>English</HI> Merchant, that carry'd him <HI>Amstredam,</HI> to where he learn'd to speak <HI>Dutch,</HI> Write and Cy∣pher, and at last was entertain'd in the <HI>East-India</HI> Companies Service; so that he was sent as an under-Book-keeper to <HI>Batavia:</HI> which Office he supplies to this day, and is twenty years old if the Ship <HI>Castrecom</HI> be safe, and not cast away.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Hollanders</HI> Answer to <HI>Sicungodonne.</HI></NOTE><HI>Sicungodonne</HI> then caus'd them to be ask'd, Why they stood so long off and on upon the <HI>Japan</HI> Coast? If they did not do it to discover their Creeks and Harbors? Why they fir'd their small and great Guns before <HI>Namboe?</HI></P>
<P>Their Answer was, That the Officers of both their Ships calling a Coun∣cil, agreed before <HI>Ternata,</HI> making a Letter of Obligation; in which both were bound, that if by Storm, Current, Mist, or otherwise, they should be separa∣ted between <HI>Ternata</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> that they should look one for another on the <HI>Japan</HI> Coast, and in dark Weather now and then to fire a Gun, that by that sign they might the easier find one another; but notwithstanding this Agree∣ment they Shot but once, which was in thirty seven Degrees and a half, out of a sixteen Pounder, for their Boat to come Aboard again, that was sent to a <HI>Japan</HI> Fisher-man, to enquire concerning the Ship <HI>Castrecom.</HI> In the Haven of <HI>Namboe</HI> they had fir'd several times onely with Powder, which was done upon the entreaty of some <HI>Japan</HI> Lords that came to see the Ship. <HI>Manikebe</HI> inter∣rupting him said, Why have you not made it known heretofore that you in∣tended for <HI>Tartary? Schaep</HI> answer'd, That it was through ignorance of the <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> Tongue in which they were Examin'd, so that it was im∣possible for them to answer and give an exact account of things they under∣stood not; and since that the Lord <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> himself telling them that they would be strictly Examin'd before the Council, so soon as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Interpre∣ters came from <HI>Firando</HI> to <HI>Jedo,</HI> made them refer answering punctually till then.</P>
<P>After that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had one days rest: the third of <HI>November</HI> they were again carry'd out of <HI>Jedo</HI> to the Court, where in twenty eight days they had one Hearing; at that time having no Watch upon them but the two Interpre∣ters, and having waited two Hours they return'd to their Lodging, the Coun∣cil not meeting that day by reason of the abundance of Rain that fell till the ninth of the said Moneth, all which time the <HI>Hollanders</HI> stay'd in their Inn, and
<PB N="347" REF="211"/>then were again carry'd to the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Appear the second time at Court to be Examin'd.</NOTE> notwithstanding the great Showers of Rain had made the Ways almost unpassable. Entring the Court with the Inter∣preters, they were carry'd into a Place where they never were before, which caused no small suspicion in them; which was augmented, because the Nobleman <HI>Phoechichemon</HI> fetch'd the Captain and the Merchant from the rest of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> which he left half an hour standing in the Rain to wait for the Council, which were then at Dinner; at last they went for shelter under a a Portal, from whence they enter'd into a spacious Hall, where <HI>Phoechichemon</HI> being busie about filling them some Wine, the News came that the Council sat; whereupon they immediately went thither, and Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> and the Mer∣chant were commanded to kneel by a Woodden Gallery; before which <HI>Sicun∣godonne</HI> sat in a Princely Throne, who again ask'd those Questions which had been demanded of them at his House concerning the two Ships, <HI>Castrecom</HI> and <HI>Breskens;</HI> to which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> answer'd as before they had done. Behind <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> the Council was placed, which they could not have a full sight of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New Questions put to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> by the Coun∣cil.</NOTE>Their Examining began thus afresh: When, where, and wherefore did you come on the <HI>Japan</HI> Coast? How could you entertain any good thoughts, when you stood to and again from our Shore, and firing your Guns.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> answer'd, The one and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> in the heighth of seven and thirty Degrees and a half, we had sight of <HI>Japan,</HI> and there lay off and on, so to find our Admiral, whom we had lost, according to our Agreement before <HI>Ternata;</HI> and notwithstanding it was concluded on in a dark Night, the the better to give one another notice to fire a Gun; which was not done above once, and that onely for to give their Boat warning to come Aboard, which was sent to a <HI>Japan</HI> Fisher-man, to enquire for their Admiral <HI>Castrecom,</HI> and they staying somewhat longer than ordinary, Shot according to their Custom to command them Aboard.</P>
<P>But <HI>Manikebe</HI> ask'd them, Out of what insight did not your People declare that you were <HI>Hollanders</HI> when you went Aboard of a <HI>Japan</HI> Fisherman, ten Leagues beyond <HI>Jedo,</HI> exchanging Rice for Fish? and hence you could not but know, that the Emperor of <HI>Japan</HI> keeps Guards on all the Promontories and Points of Land along the Sea-Coast, to watch for the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ships, who commonly put their Priests ashore in such private Places; Why did you not whilst you Cruised on the Coast send some of your Officers ashore, that might tell our Magistrates you were <HI>Hollanders?</HI> your neglecting of this Duty made the Inhabitants of <HI>Namboe</HI> suspect you: The Emperor also resented it very hainously, that you should offer to fire several Guns on his Coast, which is certainly reported to the Council, though you deny it, for which Crime you are liable to be punish'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Hollanders</HI> Answer.</NOTE>These Questions <HI>Schaep</HI> answer'd thus: The <HI>Japan</HI> Fishers receiv'd full sa∣tisfaction for their Fish: and moreover they entertain'd them with all civility, giving them <HI>Arak,</HI> and what else they desir'd, by which they might well judge we were Friends and no Enemies; besides, we inform'd them as well as we could possible, that we were <HI>Hollanders;</HI> but whether they understood it or not, be∣cause not being able to speak the <HI>Japan</HI> Tongue, we know not. Furthermore, we have not the least knowledge concerning the Emperors Watches, nor of that Order of coming ashore to make themselves known: and as for often Shooting they were altogether ignorant of, because they fir'd but once, and that was for the Reason aforesaid: and as for what happen'd, and was done
<PB N="348" REF="212"/>in the Haven of <HI>Namboe,</HI> was upon the entreaty of some <HI>Japan</HI> Lords; so that if any other great Guns have been heard to fire, they must needs have been from the Ship <HI>Castrecom,</HI> or some other Vessels.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tosaimon</HI>'s Examination.</NOTE>Whereupon <HI>Tosaimon</HI> again reply'd, Since you are <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to whom the Emperor grants a free Trade, why did you not freely ask for Masts, Yards, Rice, Provision, and other Necessaries, of which you might have had enough in the Haven of <HI>Namboe?</HI> Why did none of you go before the Magistrates then? Did the Governor of <HI>Batavia</HI> command you to put in for <HI>Japan,</HI> or did you come thither of your own accords? What Officers have the chief Com∣mand of the Ketch <HI>Breskens</HI> and <HI>Castrecon?</HI> Who will certifie the Emperor that your Voyage was for <HI>Tartary,</HI> and not rather to Land <HI>Portuguese</HI> Priests, be∣cause at present there is Peace concluded between the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and the <HI>United Netherlands?</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Schaep</HI>'s Answer.</NOTE>Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> answer'd, When on the first time they entred the Haven of <HI>Namboe,</HI> hundreds of <HI>Japanners</HI> came flocking Aboard of them to see the Ship, who being kindly entertain'd by us, granted that we should furnish our selves with fresh Water, which then was all we defir'd, and also told them that we were <HI>Hollanders:</HI> after which being toss'd by Tempest, we were a second time forc'd to stand for <HI>Namboe,</HI> but entred not the Harbor before we had leave from the Governor; who also granted us to buy all manner of Necessaries for the Ships: for which purpose coming ashore, we were carry'd Prisoners to <HI>Jedo,</HI> without the help of Witnesses to certifie that we were <HI>Hollanders;</HI> and accordingly the Emperor's Friends. Furthermore, they had no absolute Com∣mand from the Governor in <HI>Batavia,</HI> nor the <HI>Indian</HI> Council, whether to put in for <HI>Japan,</HI> nor to keep off from it; but to make a Letter of Agreement be∣fore we came from <HI>Ternata,</HI> to the end that if their Ships should be separated by Storm, or otherwise, they might the easier find one another again: by both their Ships Councel before <HI>Ternata</HI> the <HI>Japan</HI> Coast was judg'd to be fittest for that purpose, because it lay in their Way. The Command over both the Ships belong'd to the Merchant, Captain, and Pilot. Lastly, although the War between the <HI>United Netherlands</HI> and the <HI>Portuguese</HI> be laid aside for some years (concerning which a Writing was made by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> under which the <HI>East-India</HI> Company are comprehend) yet notwithstanding that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Priests were sworn Enemies to them, because of an irreconcileable difference in their Religion: wherefore they would willingly suffer the cruel'st Death that could be imagin'd, if they could any ways be accused to have put any Priests on the <HI>Japan</HI> Coast.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Manikebe</HI>'s Examina∣tion.</NOTE><HI>Manikebe</HI> ask'd moreover, Whereabouts <HI>Tartary</HI> lay? How they could find it without a Map? How they came to know that such Cities for Trade were seated there? How can your People (said he) be without Maps, whereas you have those of the whole World, where <HI>Tartary</HI> is also? Without doubt the Pilot of the Ship <HI>Castrecom</HI> hath a Map of <HI>Tartary;</HI> and would you not be ama∣zed to see such a one sent from <HI>Nangesaque.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Schaep</HI>'s Reply.</NOTE>On these Questions Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> again made this answe: We could not get a Map of <HI>Tartary</HI> any where, but had Orders from the <HI>Indian</HI> Council, that when we had Weather'd the utmost North-Point of <HI>Japan,</HI> to steer North-west, and if we could meet with no Land, to keep on till forty five Degrees, then stand to the Norch-east to six and fifty Degrees Northern Latitude, where the River <HI>Polisange</HI> disembogues into the South-Sea. On the Banks of this River are erected several famous Cities for Trade, accordingly describ'd in credible
<PB N="349" REF="212"/>Books; but because no <HI>European</HI> Ships have ever Sail'd thither, we could not find a Map of that Coast, and therefore would not regard any Chard that should be made by Art which was not real: and from thence it proceeded, that the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> though they have Maps of the World, yet they place no Sea-Coasts therein, but what are discover'd by Navigation. They could also with real truth affirm, that the Ship <HI>Castrecom</HI> was unprovided of such a Map; and if a Map of <HI>Tartary</HI> might be seen from <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> it must without doubt be one of the Inland-Countreys, and not of the Sea-Coast, because to our knowledge never any <HI>European</HI> Ship Sail'd thither to discover them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Enquiry after the Religi∣on in <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE><HI>Manykebe</HI> ask'd moreover, Are the <HI>Hollanders</HI> not <HI>Christians,</HI> and believe in the same God that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> do? What Fast-days do they keep? Keep they not holy the day on which the Cross was found? Are there no Popish-Priests in <HI>Holland?</HI> What difference is there between the two Religions of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Portuguese?</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Answer thereupon.</NOTE>These Questions were thus Answer'd, The <HI>Hollanders</HI> are <HI>Christians,</HI> and ac∣knowledge the Trinity, by which the World and all things therein were Crea∣ted about six thousand years ago, and is yet preserv'd and govern'd: They keep no Feasts, but one day in seven, call'd, <HI>The Lords-Day,</HI> on which they rest from all manner of Labors, and go in great companies to their Churches. In private there liv'd some <HI>Roman</HI> Priests that had small Congregations, for which they were often times punish'd by their Judges, by reason of the great difference between the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, and that Opinion which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> embrac'd, who abhor the <HI>Pope</HI> and all his Doctrine, and are onely bound, neither to add nor diminish to one Book or Word Written by God himself, through his Apostles: As for any farther difference, they were not able to give them any account, because from their youth they had been brought up at Sea; and it was the least of their business to enquire after the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, being well satisfi'd with the knowledge of the true Faith which their Forefathers had embrac'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> enquire con∣cerning the manner of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sea-fights.</NOTE>Moreover, <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> caus'd them to be ask'd, What Design those Ships had that Sail'd yearly from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and Cruis'd about the <HI>Cape Spirito Sancto,</HI> and before, the <HI>Manilla's?</HI> If ever they Engag'd and Conquer'd any <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships on that Coast? If a small Ship can overcome a great one? If they carry'd no Breast-Works or other Defences from Shot in their Ships? The manner of a Sea-fight? What use they made of their Hangers, Battel-Axes, Granadoes, Fire-Balls, Muskets, Harnesses, and Helmets?</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> told them, That the Councel at <HI>Batavia</HI> sent Ships to Cruise before, the <HI>Manilla's,</HI> and there to wait for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Plate-Fleet, which came yearly thither through the South-Sea; but yet had miss'd of it till that time, onely some years ago they met with one Ship which was sunk.</P>
<P>The manner of a Sea-fight was thus; When two Sail of an equal bigness, discover one another, every one seeks at first to get to Wind-ward of the other; so soon as one hath his desire, he falls down upon him that is to Lee∣ward, Fires at him, afterwards claps him Aboard, sends a Company of his Men over into the Ship, with Hangers, Granadoes, Fire-Balls, Pistols and Bat∣tle-Axes; upon which, both Parties Engage so fiercely, that either the one Par∣ty or the other, is for the most part slain: The Ship to Lee-ward being Smo∣ther'd by its own and the Enemies Smoke, hath his Enemy Aboard before he is aware. But a great Ship is very hard to be taken by a small one, except it be well-Man'd and a good Sailer, and in a dark Night, claps the great Ship
<PB N="350" REF="213"/>Aboard, putting Men enough in her to Master her; and whilst both Ships Fire Bullets, Croes, and Iron-Bars, none are Shot-free, but what stand on the Bal∣last; for the Iron-Balls which flie to and again, not onely batter all they touch, but kill most of the Men with the Splinters which flie from the sides of the Ships: Lastly, Harnesses, Helmets, or any other Iron Armor was not us'd Aboard, but in their Battels on Shore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning the taking of <HI>Quelang.</HI></NOTE><HI>Sicungodonne</HI> proceeded asking, How have you <HI>Hollanders</HI> Conquer'd the Fort <HI>Quelang?</HI> Lay there any Guns on the Castle, or not?

After which, the upper Castle made but little Resistance, so that the Soldiers having leave to depart with their Lives, Surrender'd: It was Garison'd by <HI>Spanish</HI> Souldiers, and Inhabited by <HI>Spaniards.</HI> As to the <HI>English,</HI> they drive a great Trade in many places in <HI>India, viz.</HI> in <HI>Surrat, Cormandel, Macassar,</HI> and <HI>Bantam,</HI> are friends with <HI>France, Spain, Por∣tugal, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and imbrac'd the same Doctrine that was taught in <HI>Holland;</HI> yet some Popish Priests also liv'd privately amongst them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Hollanders</HI> are strict∣ly examin'd.</NOTE>Till this time, their Examinations pass'd without any great suspicion of Danger; but now, <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> broke forth in a great Rage, and caus'd them to be ask'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Interpreter <HI>Tosaymon,</HI> How durst the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the Ketch <HI>Breskens</HI> drop a Popish Book in the Bark of the <HI>Japan</HI> Fisherman, with whom they Barter'd for Fish some Miles beyond <HI>Jedo?</HI> They should immedi∣ately make known the Contents of the Book, and what Design they had in so doing, or else their Executioners knew a way by Torture to make them relate the truth, of which they might see several Examples by the <HI>Japan</HI> Priests.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byleveld,</HI> testifi'd both together, That they had not the least knowledge of the Book of which they were accus'd; But if such a thing was done out of ignorance by any of the Sea-men, they would according to their Ship-Laws, for an Example to others, have him punish'd severely.</P>
<P><HI>Toysaman</HI> interrupting them in their Answer, said, It is a Popish Book full of Pictures of Saints, and though you <HI>Hollanders</HI> seem to testifie your Innocency in this Business, it shall not be a sufficient Excuse for you. <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> also said, The truth hereof will in a short time appear; to tell apparent untruths before the <HI>Japan</HI> Council is a Crime so great, that no punishment whatsoever is sufficient for it. <HI>Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byleveld</HI> reply'd agan, That they would willing∣ly suffer Death with all imaginable Tortures, if they could any way accuse them, to have err'd from the truth.</P>
<P>After these Examinations, the Councel rising, parted; and <HI>Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byle∣veld</HI> came again to the rest of their Company, which they found sitting in a great open Court under a Pent-House, observing, and seeing many various Passages, all sorts of People walking by them, amongst which were some Wo∣men accompany'd with Boys that carry'd Dishes of Meat to sell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of a <HI>Japan</HI> whore.</NOTE> The Women Apparel'd in <HI>Japan</HI> Coats, that trail'd after them on the Ground, and folded over before in such a manner, that the Nipples of their Breasts were bare; about their middle, a broad Girdle adorn'd with Flowers; their Sleeves large and wide, through which appear'd under the right Arm another Sleeve, all

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange entertainment of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> by the <HI>Ja∣panners.</HI></NOTE>But the foremention'd Sea-men, who waited with a longing desire to know how the Examination between their Captain, Merchant, and the Councel pas∣sed, were exceedingly amaz'd; when both the Captain and the Merchant were a second time fetch'd from them, without having time to speak one word, and were carry'd by <HI>Phoechemon</HI> through a little Door, at the end of the great open Court, which made the Sea-men judge, that so pittiful an Entry must needs lead to a place of Torture.</P>
<P>The same thoughts had Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byleveld,</HI> and expected a resera∣ble day, for no sooner being pass'd through the Door, but they came into a lit∣tle Yard, wherein stood three great Tubs full of Water, they well knowing that the <HI>Japanners</HI> us'd them as their greatest and chiefest Tortures: When the Exe∣cutioner lays the Sufferer on his Back upon the Earth, so tying him fast, and pouring this Belly full of Water, makes him disgorge it by stamping on his Breast and Belly; but soon after their fears vanquish'd, being carry'd to the Interpreters, <HI>Taysoman</HI> and <HI>Manyckebe,</HI> in a Princely Hall, where by <HI>Phoc∣chychemon</HI> they were entertain'd with Wine, Rice, and other Dainties, and in the Evening carry'd to their old Lodging.</P>
<P>The next day they were again Examin'd, and <HI>Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byleveld</HI> being brought before <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> were commanded to answer to all those Questions which had been ask'd, and they had answer'd to before; which was done, one∣ly to see if they agreed in their Story: But besides the former Questions, these were added.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Questions of the <HI>Japan∣ners.</HI></NOTE><HI>The</HI> Japan <HI>Councel can no way believe, but that your People have a Map of</HI> Tartary; <HI>perhaps the Pilot hath it, and you do not know of it; for there is no Ship that comes to an Anchor before</HI> Nangesaque, <HI>but what hath a Map: How is it possible to Sail blind-fold without this great and necessary help? After what manner could you Sail to</HI> Tartary <HI>without it?</HI> To these Questions <HI>Schaep</HI> Reply'd thus:</P>
<P>Honor'd Sirs, As to what was said Yesterday, that we had no Map of <HI>Tartary</HI> in our Ship, is very certain, and nothing but truth: We are also assur'd, that the Pilot hath no such Chart. Concerning the Ships that An∣chor before <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> their business is clear contrary, for they may easily have Maps, because they come along a Navigable Sea, of which Maps are made ready to their hands. But because no <HI>European</HI> ever Steer'd for <HI>Tartary,</HI> therefore the Sea-Coast thereof cannot possibly be mention'd in any Map; however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of Sailing by a Compass.</NOTE> our Ketch is furnish'd with Compasses, which are a great help to us, for when we come from any known place, we can by taking an Observati∣on of the height of the Sun, and the North-Star, (yet not without a Compass) return to the place from whence we came. Furthermore, our Order was from the <HI>Indian</HI> Council at <HI>Batavia,</HI> That when we came so far as our Maps directed us, which is to thirty nine Degrees, and Weather'd the utmost North-Point of <HI>Japan;</HI> then to Steer according to the Globe, of which we had two in the Ship, and so to make a Map of our own Discoveries, Steering North-West to find <HI>Tartary,</HI> in forty five Degrees.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> have a <HI>Duth</HI> Globe.</NOTE><HI>Schaep</HI> added moreover, And if it please his Lordship <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> to produce a Globe, we will shew you where <HI>Tartary</HI> lies, and also the River <HI>Polysange,</HI> and the rich Cities for Trade, seated along its Banks; that we may plainly shew you whether we design our Voyage: <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> caus'd immediately a Globe (which had formerly been given him by Master <HI>Elserak</HI>) to be fetch'd; but still looking grimly upon them, did not Command the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to shew him any thing in it, onely shew'd it them afar off; and going on in his Discourse, said, For what reasons did you not tell the Councel, that your People want∣ing a Map of <HI>Tartary</HI> could make use of a Globe, of which you had two Aboard? <HI>Schaep</HI> Reply'd, We answer'd on all things that were propos'd; but con∣cerning the Globe or any other helps in Navigation, they were not Examin'd about.</P>
<P><HI>Tosaymon</HI> in <HI>Sicungodonne</HI>'s Name ask'd them again, Why did you Fire your small and great Guns before our Coast, which is taken exceeding ill by the Emperor: and though you deny it, yet it is told us for certain truth? How often did you shoot in the Haven <HI>Namboe?</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Byleveld's</HI> argument a∣gainst <HI>Japanners.</HI></NOTE><HI>Byleveld</HI> Reply'd, That they could not help it if any false Accusation came against the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> yet they would testifie upon Oath, that they fir'd but once on the <HI>Japan</HI> Coast: And being Anchor'd upon free leave of the Gover∣nor in the Harbor <HI>Namboe,</HI> several Persons of Quality came Aboard to see them, and entring into the Cabbin, they found their Pistols and Muskets lying in their usual places, which they taking up, wonder'd that they would go off with∣out Fire, wherefore out of curiosity, they pulling the Tricker Fir'd: After∣wards upon their Entreaty, the great Guns were shot off about fourteen times with nothing but Powder.</P>
<P>But <HI>Tosaymon</HI> said, How could the <HI>Japanners</HI> Discharge your Fire-Locks, when as they know not to handle them? What kind of Arms are those Fire-Locks and Pistols? We are also inform'd, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> shot their Guns off themselves, and not the <HI>Japanners,</HI> who are too ignorant to learn those things in so small a time.</P>
<PB N="353" REF="214"/>
<P>To which <HI>Schaep</HI> Reply'd, It is a small Art to Discharge a Pistol, for we our selves Charg'd them, and afterwards Deliver'd them; these Arms strike with a Flint on a Steel, which making Fire, blows up the Powder in the Pan, by which means the Piece goes off.</P>
<P><HI>Tosaymon</HI> said, That he had seen such kind of Arms in the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships Riding before <HI>Firando:</HI> Upon which <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> caus'd a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pocket-Pistol, which had formerly been given him, to be brought into the Court, and ask'd <HI>Tosaymon,</HI> If those that he had seen were like that? who told him, that they were of the same fashion, but longer.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Schaep</HI> proceeding on, said, It need not seem strange, that the <HI>Japanners</HI> can use the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Arms, there being nothing else to be done, than to pull the Tricker towards them with the foremost Finger: Whilst these Examina∣tions pass'd in <HI>Sicungodonne</HI>'s House, there sat a <HI>Japan</HI> Priest next the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who oftentimes would accuse them, and tell it to <HI>Sicungodonne.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further accusation against the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></NOTE>Moreover, <HI>Manykebe</HI> ask'd them, Why did you resist with Hangers drawn when you were taken Prisoners? Did you not expect that the Emperor would resent it very hainously, for you to come as Spies, and make Inspections into his Coasts? Why did you not make known that you were <HI>Hollanders?</HI> Have none of you ever been in <HI>Japan?</HI> Do you know Mr. <HI>Elserak, Overtwater, Kocke∣bakker,</HI> and <HI>Caron?</HI> Will not <HI>Caron</HI> come again from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>India?</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their answer to it.</NOTE>These Questions were answer'd by <HI>Schaep,</HI> who said, Believe most Honor'd Sir, that we are falsly accus'd of making refistance, when under the pretence of Friendship we were Betray'd, and misus'd like the worst of Villains. Why should we resist, being in a strange Countrey, and beset round about, and saw not the least place to escape? Should eight <HI>Hollanders</HI> go to make a way to their Boat, which without doubt was Guarded with hundreds of Soldiers; none of us were provided with Arms, but onely I with a Hanger, which we did, be∣cause we knew our selves to be Friends to the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor, therefore we ex∣pect to be releas'd from our Imprisonment, being kept without any cause? And who would accuse true Friends for Spies, because by order of a Letter of Agreement, we sought for our Admiral <HI>Castrecom</HI> on the North-Coast of <HI>Japan</HI> which was in our way to <HI>Tartary;</HI> and had we known that our Cruising there would have been so ill taken, we would rather have chosen to have perish'd with hunger in the Ocean, than incurr'd the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperors Displeasure. Moreover, We have declar'd several times, that we were <HI>Hollanders,</HI> but we cannot help it that it is deny'd, or that being not experienc'd in the Language, we could not make them understand it. None of the Prisoners have ever set foot on <HI>Japan</HI> before this time; but I have been twice in <HI>Firando,</HI> from whence about three years ago I carry'd Mr. <HI>Francis Caron</HI> to <HI>Batavia;</HI> and I spoke with <HI>Elserak</HI> and <HI>Overtwater,</HI> a little before my coming from <HI>Batavia:</HI> I also knew <HI>Kockebakker,</HI> who at this time lives and is Marry'd in <HI>Holland:</HI> Concerning <HI>Ca∣ron</HI>'s return to <HI>India,</HI> I know no certainty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sicungodonne</HI> requires and obligation from the <HI>Hol∣landers.</HI></NOTE>At last, <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> ask'd them, If they were willing to Sign an Obligation, in which they should be bound to be ready at all times upon the Emperors Command, to appear before the Councel; and if ever they were found guilty of bringing over <HI>Portugal</HI> Priests into <HI>Japan,</HI> then the Obligation to be forfeited: And for performance of this, not onely they then present should be Bound, but also the <HI>Netherland</HI> Governor in <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> with all the Goods belonging to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, on the Island <HI>Disma</HI> with them; Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> and the other Prisoners embrac'd this proffer freely, being all very well assur'd, that

<P>After this proffer, and their acceptance of it, <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> rose up, going some Paces from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> setting himself down at the end of the Galle∣ry, where he drew a Draught of the foremention'd Obligation; whilst the Letters that were written the tenth of <HI>September,</HI> by <HI>Elserak</HI> and <HI>Overtwater,</HI> from <HI>Nangesaque,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dutch</HI> Letter translated into the <HI>Japan</HI> Tongue.</NOTE> were deliver'd to <HI>Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byleveld,</HI> that they might be interpre∣ted into the <HI>Japan</HI> Tongue, and given to the Council; about which they had great trouble, to make <HI>Tosaymon</HI> understand the Contents of the Letter, the In∣terpreter having but little knowledge of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Tongue; so that he spent most of the time in asking to whom the said Letter did belong; for the <HI>Japan</HI> Council doubted, that the Prisoners belong'd to the <HI>Netherland East-India</HI> Com∣pany: Wherefore <HI>Tosaymon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Examination concerning. <HI>Elseraks</HI> Letter.</NOTE> by <HI>Sicugodonne</HI>'s Order, strictly examin'd them to whom the Letter was written; whereupon he was answer'd, To Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> the Merchant, and the other Prisoners: But, said <HI>Tosaymon,</HI> Have <HI>Else∣rak</HI> and <HI>Overtwater</HI> given you no advice in their Letter, how you should carry your self, and what you should answer before the Council. On which they replied, That the Letter contain'd nothing but their sorrow for our Imprison∣ment, which they had heard from the Governor of <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> the Arrival of five <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships in the Rode before <HI>Disma;</HI> their hopes of making good Advantage that Year; an admonishment of being at peace and quiet amongst our selves; and a strict charge of carrying our selves with great re∣spect to the <HI>Japan</HI> Council.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sicungodonne</HI> shews him∣self courteous to the <HI>Hol∣landers.</HI></NOTE>These Contents were translated by <HI>Tosaymon,</HI> who instantly gave it to <HI>Sicun∣godonne,</HI> and he deliver'd the Obligation to <HI>Tosaymon,</HI> that he might translate the same into the <HI>Low-Dutch,</HI> so that they might sign and return it to him again. <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> also sent one of his Secretaries to <HI>Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byleveld,</HI> who told them, That to morrow he would carry the Obligation to the Council, and intercede to them for their Discharge, though he could not certainly pro∣mise that their Liberty would be granted instantly: For which kind Proffer, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> thank'd him, and <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> in whose Name he was sent.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stubbornness of the In∣terpreters.</NOTE>These did not any way repeat, or as much as speak of what had pass'd all that day; which was partly out of high-mindedness, and partly out of ex∣ceeding Pride, of which both were guilty: Onely snapping at them, said, If you did not mistake in speaking before the Council and <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> you had long before this time been releas'd. Yet notwithstanding their sharp Lan∣guage, they gave them not the least Counsel to mend their Faults; so that <HI>Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byleveld</HI> were ignorant where the Mistake was: And though they besought earnestly, that <HI>Tosaymon</HI> and <HI>Manykebe</HI> would be pleas'd to tell them wherein they offended, yet they got no answer, both only giving them the hearing, sometimes scornfully denying their Request, and at other times, without giving any answer, they went out of the Chamber; which occasion'd great trouble to the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>But the Obligation written by <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> being sign'd by <HI>Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byle∣veld,</HI>
<PB N="355" REF="215"/>and deliver'd to the Secretary <HI>Inowy Sycungono Cammysamma,</HI> was to this purpose: <Q><HI>Henry Cornelison Schaep,</HI> and <HI>William Byleveld</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Obligation sign'd by the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></NOTE> witness, with the <HI>Hol∣land</HI> Prisoners, That they fir'd some Guns from their Ship <HI>Breskens,</HI> accord∣ing to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Customs, not knowing it to be forbidden to do any such thing on the <HI>Japan</HI>-Coast; wherefore they sue for Pardon for that Fault.

<P>Notwithstanding this Obligation, which was again deliver'd to <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> yet they had not their Liberty granted them; but on the second day the two Interpreters, <HI>Kitsbyoye, Phatsyosaman,</HI> and the Apostate Priest <HI>Syovan,</HI> came to their Inn, asking if they had not a Map aboard of their Ship <HI>Breskens?</HI> If they had not fired in the Haven <HI>Namboe?

One of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> answer'd; "It is apparent that God hath forsaken us in this World, as the Children thereof; yet he hath never forsa∣ken those that trust in him, because he helps us in our greatest Extremities, when a tortur'd Person is not sensible of his Pain, the Soul being rapt with Heavenly Contemplations; and considers, that these Temporal Torments last no longer than Life.</Q> The third <HI>Jesuit</HI> said; <Q>God visits us, for our ma∣nifold Sins, with great and several Afflictions; yet the Soul remains un∣touch'd by any Executioner. When the Soul leaves the Body, she goes to Purgatory, where (though not without great pain) she is long cleansed and purified, till she is fit to go to a Heavenly <HI>Elizium,</HI> there to enjoy all Happi∣ness. God therefore forsakes not his Children, because he brings them to Everlasting Life, notwithstanding the way thither is very troublesom. It is true, that these poor and miserable Bodies are in the Emperor's Power, which he would not have, were it not granted him from God: Also all Humane Authority ceases over Man, when the Soul is departed out of the Body. The last <HI>Jesuit</HI> concluded the propos'd Questions after this manner; Without the True God, is no Salvation; and without his Will and Permit∣tance, nothing either good or bad can be done.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Japan</HI> Council not well experienc'd in the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, wanted Questions to ask them, and therefore call'd for <HI>Syovan</HI> the Apostate Priest, who was there ready for that purpose. So soon as he saw the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> he look'd very
<PB N="358" REF="217"/>fiercely upon them, notwithstanding he had formerly been one of their Or∣der, and in a scoffing manner laid,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Syovan</HI> despises the <HI>Je∣suits</HI> very shrewdly.</NOTE><Q>Now fie upon you <HI>Jesuits,</HI> that make this World in an Uproar. How you vapor of your God and Salvation? Are none sav'd but <HI>Jesuits,</HI> or those that embrace your Opinion? In what con∣sists your Interest in Heaven? Is it because you privately dissemble with, and defraud all Princes; and gathering, hoard up the Worlds Treasure? Had you remain'd still in your usual Pleasures, the <HI>Japan</HI> Prisons had not har∣bor'd such a crue of Antichrists; nay, <HI>Japan</HI> had never shed so much Blood: for thousands, by your Delusions, were taken from their Worship of the ancient Gods <HI>Amida, Xaca,</HI> and <HI>Canon,</HI> and embrac'd the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, for which they suffer'd the cruellest Deaths. Was it under a pretence to win Souls? Why did you then carry so many Tun of Gold yearly out of <HI>Japan?</HI> And why did you plot to bring <HI>Japan</HI> under the Subjection of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tyrant, and so to order all things according to your pleasure? But now, what is the Power of the <HI>Christian</HI> God? Look upon your miserable Bodies; can he not help you? Where then is he Omnipotent? Will he not help you? Where is his Mercy? O foolish thought of Salvation! You are distracted, to continue thus in your stubborn humor, imagining to receive great Re∣wards from God, and great Esteem of your Successors, in suffering wilfully your Bodies to be thus tormented. I ask once again, Why doth not your God help you? Certainly your Life is not in his Hands, but in the Empe∣rors of <HI>Japan,</HI> who when he pleaseth can punish and torture you more than ever he hath done yet.</Q></P>
<P>This the <HI>Hollanders</HI> understood very well, because <HI>Syovan</HI> spoke with a loud Voice; and they also were us'd to his Stile, by reason of their conversation with him in their Inn.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To the great satisfaction of the Council.</NOTE> But whilst <HI>Syovan</HI> rail'd thus at the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> he seem'd exceedingly to please two of the <HI>Japan</HI> Council, <HI>Sackay Sammoccysame,</HI> and <HI>Mat∣sodairo Ysossamma,</HI> with his Discourse, and chiefly when he spoke of <HI>Amida</HI> and <HI>Xaca.</HI></P>
<P>¶ IT is worthy our Observation, that not only the <HI>Japanners,</HI> but also all other <HI>Heathens,</HI> nay, such <HI>Pagans</HI> that acknowledg'd one God, yet gave not Divine Honor to the very true God: For understanding by the Light of Nature, that there must upon necessity be a God, that Created Heaven and Earth, and requir'd to be Worshipp'd, they ascrib'd the Godhead to the Crea∣ture; not unlike the blind Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 9. <HI>v.</HI> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</NOTE> of which St. <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist makes men∣tion; for he, when he saw the Son of God, of whom he had receiv'd sight, ask'd him, who was Gods Son? because him whom he saw, he knew not who he was.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ignorance of the Anci∣ents concerning God, and especially the <HI>Japanners.</HI></NOTE> So in like manner all the <HI>Heathens</HI> look to this day on the Invisible God, openly in his Visible Works: They hear him calling with a loud, yet silent Voice, <HI>I am the Creator of the World, the Preserver and Governor, to whom all Di∣vine Worship belongs:</HI> But they shut their Eyes from seeing, and stop their Ears from hearing, no otherwise than if they dream'd; and following their own Imaginations, put the Visible Creature in the place of the Invisible Creator. And so the <HI>Japanners</HI> acknowledge a God; and yet <HI>Amida, Xaca, Canon,</HI> and other Idols (whose Beginning and Original they deny not) they give Divine Wor∣ship and Honor to.</P>
<P>But this Error is very ancient: The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> saith thus of the <HI>Heathens; Professing themselves to be wise,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 1. <HI>v.</HI> 22, 23, 24, 25.</NOTE> <HI>they became sools: And chang'd the Glory of the uncor∣ruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four-footed
<PB N="359" REF="217"/>Beasts, and Creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own Bodies between themselves: Who chang'd the Truth of God into a Lie, and worshipp'd and serv'd the Creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever, Amen.</HI> Gods Truth is chang'd into Lies, when Divine Worship is shewn to any thing but to the real God: For it is a Truth, That there is a God; and to say that the Creature is God, is a Lie.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander ab Hales</HI> saith thus concerning it; <Q>To keep Gods Truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alex. ab Hales, <HI>p.</HI> Sum∣mae. <HI>q 30.</HI> de Adorat. <HI>a. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> is to serve God; to change his Truth into Lies, is to serve the Creature in stead of the Creator: For the right Worship consists in the Service of the onely true God: Therefore if the Idolaters serve the Creature in stead of the Creator, they change the Truth into Lies.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reasons of Idolatry.</NOTE>It seems that Man, because he saw not God, therefore most wickedly made that God which he saw: For since it is just and right, to give to every thing its due; yet the <HI>Heathens</HI> have given that Worship to the poor Creature, which belong'd only to God: so not only bereaving God of his Honor, but also ascribing this Honor to that which never was, nor ever can be God.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Learned <HI>Hea∣thens</HI> thought of God.</NOTE>Those which were somewhat wiser than the Vulgar, had not such foolish thoughts of God as the Common People; yet they suffer'd themselves to be carried away by the general Example, judging it to be sufficient to think of a God, whether it was the right or no, that govern'd Mankind.</P>
<P>The one seem'd not to be concern'd to seek after God by the Light of Na∣ture, because they pursu'd their Pleasures, and made their Bellies their Gods; as the famous <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Gluttons, which search'd both Sea and Land, to find Dainties for their never-satisfied Appetites. Other <HI>Heathens</HI> were too busie in purchasing Honor, or else too covetous; and others were too poor to lose time from begging for their Living:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why they sought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ter God.</NOTE> So that they found so much to do on Earth, that they never studied for Heavenly Enjoyments.

<P>However, this Truth is very evident, That God inlightned the <HI>Pagans</HI> with some Beams, <HI>Because that which may be known of God, is manifest in them,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 1.19, 20.</NOTE> <HI>for God hath shewed it unto them;</HI> (as the Apostle speaks) <HI>For the invisible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead.</HI> The Truth stirr'd them not up to the working for Salvation.

<P>The true Worship is a Duty from Mankind to God; but Idolatry is com∣mitted so often as a Man adores with Zeal (which is onely due to God) that which is not God.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spiritual Workings are three sorts.</NOTE>These kind of religious Instigations are observ'd to be three, being either outward, or outward and inward joyn'd together, or onely outward. The inward workings embrace above all the Love of God, Fear of God, Trust in God. The mixt workings are all religious Worships, which remain inward, because they proceed from the Heart; and outward, because utter'd with the Mouth. The Praying with the Heart and Mouth consists in Thanksgiving for received Benefits, and partly intreating for continuance of old Mercies, and for the obtaining of new. The outward Zeal appears by the Behavior in religious Matters; to which belongs the building of Temples and Altars, kil∣ling of Sacrifice, keeping Feast-days; or else by the actions of the Body, either bending down their Bodies forward, or lying flat on the Earth, bowing their Heads, folding and kissing their Hands: which Ceremony is perform'd to express they acknowledge God as the Donor of all good things, and Redeemer from all bad.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Common Civility.</NOTE>But it is quite otherwise in the respect and honor that is shewn from Man to Man;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genes. 33.3.</NOTE> for so <HI>Jacob bowed himself seven times to the ground till he came near to his Brother Esau:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 23.7.</NOTE> and <HI>Abraham also stood up and bowed himself to the people of the Land, even to the children of Heth.</HI> But this honor may be chang'd into a religious Worship, as may appear by <HI>Nebuchadnezzars</HI> Image.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Idols what they are.</NOTE>And so it is with the <HI>Japan</HI> Idols, who formerly were Kings, or other noble Persons, that either kept their Countrey from Invasion of Enemies, or for their several Victories and other Atchievements, prudent Government, or else for the inventing of some noble Art by which they reap'd much profit, in their Life-times were highly honor'd, and after their Decease, and in process of time were worshipp'd as gods.</P>
<P>Amongst which number are <HI>Toranga,</HI> a Huntsman in <HI>Corea,</HI> who slew eight <HI>Japan</HI> Tyrants, and therefore is represented with as many Arms and Hands Arm'd with Clubs, Swords, Dagger, Scymiter, Pole-Ax, Bowe, Pike and Gauntlet.</P>
<P>And also <HI>Xaca,</HI> who was the first that taught the <HI>Japanners</HI> the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Doctrine concerning the transmigration of the Soul: The Place of his Birth is said to be in <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise <HI>Han</HI> and <HI>Deva,</HI> both Kings of <HI>Tanguth,</HI> were for their prudent and

<P>In like manner their new Idol <HI>Xantai</HI> in the City <HI>Anzuquiama,</HI> erected by the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor <HI>Nobunanga,</HI> that he might be worshipp'd in that Image.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Something belonging to the <HI>Japan</HI> Religion is strange.</NOTE>Concerning these <HI>Japan</HI> Idols something is very remarkable, namely, That the <HI>Japanners</HI> ascribe a beginning to <HI>Amida, Xaca, Canon, Xantai, Toranga,</HI> and other Devils; whereas the true God is without beginning; so that upon neces∣sity they must acknowledge an ever-being God; but they worship him not, and are so ignorant of his everlasting Essence, that they have not a word where∣by properly to express God.</P>
<P>The same <HI>Joseph de Acosta</HI> ascribes to the Inhabitants of <HI>Peru,</HI> a part of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> who (if the Learned <HI>John de Laet</HI> may be credited) are Extracted from <HI>Tartary,</HI> bordering on the North of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Chineses</HI> acknowledge their original to be from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and the <HI>Japanners</HI> from the <HI>Chineses:</HI> All of them have their own Names for their several Idols; but they cannot properly name the true and ever-being God.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Peruans</HI> and <HI>Japanners</HI> cannot name God.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Persians,</HI> saith <HI>Acosta,</HI> believe in a Supream God, by them call'd <HI>Viraco∣cha,</HI> and also <HI>Pachacamac</HI> and <HI>Pachaiahacu,</HI> that is, <HI>Creator of Heaven and Earth.</HI> They gave him also the Title of <HI>Usapu,</HI> signifying <HI>Wonderful;</HI> but yet they can∣not find a word whereby they may properly express, as many other People, the Name of him whom they serve in chief; so that whereas the <HI>English</HI> call him <HI>GOD;</HI> the <HI>Hebrews, EL;</HI> the <HI>Greeks,</HI> ΘΕΟΣ the <HI>Latines, DEUS;</HI> the <HI>Peruan</HI> Tongue will not bear any of the words.

<P>The same <HI>Peruans</HI> serve the Creator in the stately Temple <HI>Pachumac;</HI> yet make Offerings to other petty gods.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japanners</HI> also know of an everlasting Being; but, as we said, want a Name, and worshipp'd him not: whereas on the contrary, thousands of Tem∣ples are erected in <HI>Japan</HI> for their Deities <HI>Amida, Xaca, Canon, Toranga,</HI> and others; nay, there is scarce any Countrey on the Earth able to stand in Competition with <HI>Japan</HI> for Temples.</P>

The antient <HI>Greeks</HI> had another way of Writing, as may be seen by the famous Laws of the wise <HI>Solon,</HI> which was, where the first Line ended the second began directly and upright, and where the second ended there began the third, and so accordingly the rest, not unlike Roads in Countreys, which take a beginning where others end, and of∣tentimes are cut through one another.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Genial Dies.</HI> l. 2. c. 36.</NOTE> Lastly, the <HI>Chineses,</HI> a great part of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and all the <HI>Japanners,</HI> begin on the right-side, and so Write from the top downwards.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander ab Alexandro</HI> relates, That the antient <HI>Moors</HI> in like manner in for∣mer Ages, placed their Letters one amongst another; and also the <HI>Mexicans</HI> according to <HI>Acosta.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great care hath been ta∣ken at all times to promote the Art of Writing.</NOTE>Moreover the Antients have much tir'd themselves in this Art, every one in∣venting a new way: first all publick Acts were Engraven on Plates of Lead; but peculiar Accidents of single Persons noted on Linnen. <HI>Egypt</HI> was the first that afforded Paper, made of Plants pasted together. In <HI>Rome</HI> also were us'd a long time Tablets cover'd with Wax, of which two, three, or five were
<PB N="365" REF="220"/>sow'd together, being either of a Saffron, or Egg-colour, Green, or Purple on three doubles they writ Letters; on five doubles, Titles and Offices of Ho∣nour; and on the double ones, peculiar Secrets. The <HI>Grecians</HI> sometimes us'd the Bark of a Lint-tree in stead of Paper. <HI>Attalus</HI> fitted Goat-skins to Write on in the City <HI>Pergamum</HI> from whence to this day all over <HI>Europe</HI> it is call'd <HI>Pergamenum,</HI> or <HI>Parchment.</HI> The <HI>Brachmans,</HI> antient Philosophers amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> made use of fine Linnen, on which they drew black Letters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inventers of Characters, and chiefly <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Ja∣panners.</HI></NOTE>Moreover <HI>Cadmus</HI> brought the <HI>Grecian</HI> Characters from <HI>Phaenicia</HI> to <HI>Greece; Radamanthus</HI> furnish'd the <HI>Assyrians; Memnon</HI> and <HI>Anubis,</HI> the <HI>Egyptians; Hercules,</HI> the <HI>Phrygians; Carmenta,</HI> the <HI>Latines;</HI> every one with several Letters or Chara∣cters. But the <HI>Japanners</HI> Extracted from <HI>China,</HI> Write antienter Characters than any other Countrey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Chronicles make mention of <HI>Fohi,</HI> who was the first King of <HI>China,</HI> and Reign'd about three hundred years after <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood, that he inven∣ted Letters, which he made of Serpents, Snakes, and the like, strangely tangl'd and wound up together: wherefore his Book of <HI>Astronomy</HI> is by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Fohi Xi-lum-zu,</HI> that is, <HI>Fohi's Book of Serpents.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Characters us'd by the antient <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Japanners.</HI></NOTE> After that several Kings in <HI>China</HI> found divers strange Marks for Writing: <HI>Xum-num</HI> invented the Pictures of Husbandry; <HI>Xan Hoan,</HI> of Birds; <HI>Chuem Kim,</HI> of Oysters and Worms; another, of Herbs and Plants; <HI>Choan Ham,</HI> of Birds Feet; <HI>Yao,</HI> of Tortoises.</P>
<P>Besides these kind of writing Marks, the antient <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Japanners</HI> us'd in their Writing several Marks of Peacocks, Herbs, or Quills, and several other Fancies, invented by the Emperor <HI>Co,</HI> or from the Stars or Planets, and also Fishes. Besides these, also there are other peculiar Characters, of which some are us'd onely in writing of Law-business, others in Letters and Super∣scriptions. They have also particular Characters to express Peace, Joy, Darkness, Clearness, and Disputations, and resemble not in the least the other <HI>Japan</HI> Marks for Writing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Original of the <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Japan</HI> Characters.</NOTE>The Learned cannot agree when they enquire after the original of this Art: for some acknowledge the <HI>Assyrians</HI> for the first inventers; but most ascribe the honor to the <HI>Egyptians:</HI> But if the <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Japanners</HI> us'd Marks for Writing three thousand six hundred eighty nine years ago, according to the Book of Serpents of their first King <HI>Fohi,</HI> then they knew it before the <HI>Assyrians</HI> and <HI>Egyptians;</HI> yet it cannot be deny'd, though the <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Egyptians</HI> express their meanings by the placing of Beasts and Plants, without making any Letters, that there is a great difference, because the <HI>Egyptians</HI> not onely in their common Conversation, but us'd the same Marks in their religious Matters: therefore none might learn them but those that were commanded, and had leave from their Governors. And also the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Hieroglyphicks signifi'd not onely the thing it represented, but also the hidden property, and sole operation of the written Matter; whereas on the contrary, the <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Japanners</HI> Writing express and describe the Transactions of Men, and other natural things, and shew plainly the whole Matter without any farther Mysteries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Language call'd <HI>Quanhoa,</HI> why invented.</NOTE>Moreover, the <HI>Chineses</HI> have a general Language call'd <HI>Quonhoa,</HI> which the have made themselves: for <HI>China</HI> being divided into great and mighty King∣doms, whereof the Governors, or <HI>Mandarins,</HI> must give a yearly account to the Emperor at his Court at <HI>Pechin,</HI> or <HI>Nanchin;</HI> and every <HI>Chinese</HI> Territory having their peculiar Language, which is different from their Neighbors, therefore they found out that Language call'd <HI>Quanhoa;</HI> which is not onely us'd amongst
<PB N="366" REF="221"/>the Courtiers, but also in all manner of Contracts, and is spoke by most, but chiefly by the best bred <HI>Chineses,</HI> by reason this Language hath very short Sen∣tences: for though it contains many Letters, yet it hath scarce three hundred twenty six Words which begin all with one Letter, and end with one of the Vowels, <HI>a, e, i, o, u,</HI> or <HI>m, x, n;</HI> from whence it proceeds, that one word often hath more than twenty several significations, and according to the soft or loud pronunciation of it, signifies either this or that.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Five several People can understand it when they Read it, but not when they Speak it.</NOTE>The chiefest thing to be admir'd in this <HI>Mandarine</HI> Tongue, is, that when Written it is understood by all, the <HI>Chineses, Japanners, Coreans, Tonchinensers,</HI> and those of <HI>Couchinchina,</HI> but they cannot speak it; for then the one Countrey can∣not in the least understand another.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther Examination of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> by the <HI>Ja∣pan</HI> Councellors.</NOTE>¶ TO return again to our Examination.

<P>In this Hall for Audience lay a new <HI>Japan</HI> Drum, on which the Councellor <HI>Matsodairo Ysosamma</HI> commanded the Youth <HI>Jacob de Paw,</HI> which was also Exa∣min'd, to Beat on it; who being not altogether ignorant in that Art, first beat a <HI>March,</HI> and then an <HI>Alarm,</HI> with which he seem'd exceedingly to please the Lords: and presently after they rose up all together, and went out, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> got leave to go to their Inn.</P>

<P>These Women, when they walk abroad, are very richly Clothed, their Hair curiously adorn'd with long Ribbons ty'd together, hanging down their Necks; by their left Temple appears a Golden Bodkin, at the end of which hangs a

<P>Whilst these Persons of Honor engag'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> eyes on their Way homewards, <HI>Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byleveld</HI> had some Discourse with the Interpreters <HI>Tosai∣mon</HI> and <HI>Manikebe</HI> concerning what had pass'd in <HI>Sicungodonne</HI>'s Palace.

Whereupon <HI>Tosaimon</HI> told them, That <HI>Sam∣moccysamma</HI> had been incensed against them, and told, When he saw the <HI>Hollan∣ders,</HI> he must judge by their presence, that they were guilty of bringing over <HI>Japan</HI> Priests; and chiefly when they should be placed next the four <HI>Portuguese</HI> Prisoners.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollanders</HI> receive tidings.</NOTE>The next day after <HI>Manikebe</HI> visited the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in their Inn, and amongst other Discourse he related, That the day before he had been with <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> and other <HI>Japan</HI> Lords, of whom he understood, that they should stay in <HI>Jedo</HI> till <HI>Elseracks</HI> coming thither.

<P>Moreover, <HI>Manikebe</HI> told them from <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> That they should not be melancholly nor troubled, but be chearful and merry, for Mr. <HI>Elserak</HI> would shortly set forth on his Journey thither.</P>
<P><HI>Phatsyosamon</HI> told them also, That he had receiv'd tidings from <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> wherein he had advice of the Arrival of a <HI>Holland</HI> Ship, Laden with Skins, Pepper, and Speckel'd Wood; and also that a <HI>Dutch</HI> Flie-Boat accidental∣ly took Fire, yet the Flame being suddenly quench'd, sustain'd but little damage.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange way of Writing and Cyphering without Let∣ters or Figures.</NOTE>But though <HI>Mexico</HI> drive a great Trade and keep all their accounts in those Characters, yet their Neighbors the <HI>Peruvians</HI> knew not the Art of Writing, and understood neither Characters nor any other Strokes resembling Letters; but us'd divers colour'd Strings with Bedes, which serv'd them as well as Books.

<P>¶ BUt to return again to our <HI>Holland</HI> Prisoners, who when the Lord that had read their Questions, and writ down their Answers was gone, they ask'd the <HI>Netherland</HI> Interpreters, In what Degree of Latitude and Longitude the Territory of <HI>Matsymay</HI> lay, before which the said foremention'd Ship was seen, but they told them they knew not. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were not a little suspi∣cious of this answer, and the more, because they understood of some of the House-Servants, upon promise to be silent, that some of the Men of the fore∣nam'd Vessel were taken and brought up Prisoners.</P>
<P>The next day the <HI>Hollanders</HI> came again into the fair Chamber of their Land∣lords, and there found, besides the four Interpreters, the same Lord that the day before had read their Questions to them out of a Paper, and understood that he was call'd <HI>Bongyo;</HI> next to whom sate three other <HI>Japan</HI> Nobles, which they had not seen before, of which one look'd very stemly upon the <HI>Hollan∣ders,</HI> being a Man as they judg'd, about two and forty years old, tall, and with a great and flat Face, of an Oleaster Complexion, and an indented Nose, who the day before had been in the foremention'd Ship, and was come there to see if any of the ten Prisoners were like unto those which he had seen.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New Examination by the foresaid Noblemen.</NOTE>And <HI>Bongyo</HI> ask'd the same Questions he had done before, putting one before the other, by that means, if he could, to Trappan the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in a lie. And lastly, added these new Questions to the former; Of what Stature and Age are the Commanders, Pilot, and Merchant in the Ship <HI>Castrecom?</HI> How many Sea∣men in the Ship <HI>Breskens</HI> wear short Hair? How many Men did <HI>Castrecom</HI> and <HI>Breskens</HI> carry when they Weigh'd Anchor from <HI>Batavia?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Schaep</HI> answer'd these Questions thus: The Head-Commander is scarce one and forty, is a handsome tall Man, with brown Hair, and a neat Beard. The Pilot about twenty six years old, of a middle Stature. The Merchant three years younger than the Pilot, hath no Beard; as for those that wear short Hair, we cannot give any certain account; but as we guess, there were between fifteen and twenty in the Ketch <HI>Breskens.</HI> Moreover <HI>Castrecom</HI> and <HI>Breskens</HI> carry'd six∣ty Men apiece, when they set Sail from <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>These Answers being again written down by <HI>Bongyo,</HI> he role up to be gone, onely stay'd a little while discoursing with the other three Nobles, who look'd very sternly upon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to their no small amazement; wherefore after <HI>Bongyo</HI>'s departure, with the other Nobles, they enquir'd of <HI>Tosaymon</HI> and <HI>Ma∣nykebe,</HI> if they knew not in what degree the foresaid Ship was seen, and where the People were taken Prisoners? And also, if no new trouble by their being taken might happen to them?</P>
<P><HI>Tosaymon</HI> answer'd, That the Ship Sail'd with a small Gale along the North∣ern Shore of <HI>Japan,</HI> Southerly. The Boat which it Tow'd had Mast and Bolt-Sprit, and carry'd four Stone-Guns, and a small Boat was ty'd fast to her side: And said <HI>Tosaymon,</HI> How can any new trouble arise from hence? It must needs be for your delivery, when the Prisoners taken out of <HI>Castrecom,</HI> witness that you were sent to <HI>Tartary;</HI> for their Relation concerning the same, if they agree with yours, will affirm it to be truth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the four <HI>Jesuits</HI> are set at liberty by the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor.</NOTE>After that, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> understood from <HI>Phatsyosaymon</HI> and their Landlords Sons, that the Emperor kept the four <HI>Jesuits</HI> in Prison, till <HI>Elseraks</HI> coming thi∣ther,

By this means they thought for time to come, to play their Game, and the more, because the <HI>Christians</HI> in all places, as if they arose out of the Ashes of the Martyrs, began to Live afresh: So that the Emperor was puzzel'd, seeing no small danger to threaten his Crown; wherefore, he contrary to all those that had been his Predecessors, was at the Examination of <HI>Christian</HI> Prisoners, or <HI>Portugal</HI> Priests himself, out of meer fear of an Insurrection.</P>
<P>¶ THe five and twentieth of <HI>October,</HI> the Gentleman <HI>Isycauwa Isajamondonne</HI> brought word, That <HI>Elserak</HI> on the ninth of that instant, was come to <HI>Osacca,</HI> and was to appear in five days at the Emperors Court, being com∣manded by the Emperor to come with all speed to <HI>Jedo,</HI> without staying to bring the usual Presents with him, but let them alone to come after. <HI>Isycauwa</HI> told them also for certain, that they should once more be examin'd concerning their Voyage, and then be set at liberty.</P>

<P>Hither the two Interpreters came to them, proffering their Service to them, to give a Letter in private to the Ambassador <HI>Elserak; Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byleveld</HI> were a long time doubtful what to do in this Affair, whether or no they durst repose so much confidence in them.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Byleveld's</HI> Answer.</NOTE><HI>Byleveld</HI> answer'd: Concerning the Goods which were shewn to us, we have so much knowledge of them, that the like is aboard our Ship <HI>Breskens;</HI> but because we know not that an Exchange was made between the Seamen belonging to her, and the <HI>Japanners,</HI> therefore we believe that the Goods came out of <HI>Castrecom,</HI> which we judge to have been cast away in <HI>May,</HI> by a Storm which arose in the Night, before an unknown Land.

Moreover, the Crosses and Marks on the several Packs and Bales, signifie nothing else, than the Arms of the <HI>Hol∣land</HI> Towns in which the inclos'd Goods are to be had. Lastly, the Woodden Crosses and <HI>Ave-Maries</HI> belong to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church; and therefore they never carried them in their Ships.</P>
<P><HI>Byleveld</HI> had no sooner ended, but <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> ask'd again; Is (said he) your God the same as the <HI>Castilian</HI> and <HI>Portugal?</HI> What is his Name? Who did ever see him? Where hath he convers'd? Whereby do you believe your God to be the True God?</P>

<P>Secondly, They ascrib'd to God a Freedom against all Power, because he hath an irresistible Power, which is as Mighty and Omnipotent as God him∣self.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disown God to be a sub∣stance.</NOTE>Lastly, They believ'd that his Godly Nature suffer'd no Connexion to or with himself; for where there is such a Connexion, there must needs be some∣thing equal, or alike, to connect: but in God is no want of any such connect∣ed Assimilation; for if there were, then the Cause of such Want must precede the Connexion, and consequently be before God: but God is the First Causer of all things. And on these grounds they could find, that God was not Sub∣stantial, and Frail; much less consisted of Soul and Body: Which if the Learn'd <HI>Anaxagoras,</HI> Master of the famous <HI>Socrates,</HI> had not understood, he would not have call'd God a Spirit, and said, That all things proceeded from the Power of an Everlasting Spirit.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Byleveld</HI>'s Answer.</NOTE>¶ BUt to return to our Story: <HI>Byleveld</HI> gave <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> this Answer; <Q>The <HI>Castilians</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> acknowledge a Trinity, as well as the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> but they represent him in the shape of an Old, a Young Man, and a Dove; which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> hold to be abominable: For they ac∣knowledge God to be an endless Spiritual Being, of whom none may or can make any Likeness, neither by Images, or Imaginations of the Heart. Moreover, God hath given himself divers Names in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongues; but the <HI>Hollanders</HI> call him <HI>God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:</HI> And because he is an Incomprehensible Spirit, he can be seen by none; from whence it always proceeds, that a Man can no way see his own nor anothers Soul: Yet the Invisible God is Visible in the Works of his Creation, Pre∣servation, and Governing of all things.

<P>Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> answer'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Schaep</HI>'s Reply.</NOTE> <Q>The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> said he, keep the first Day of the Week, like the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> on which every one rests from their Labor, and goes to Church to hear Divine Service: Only on some extrordinary Occasion, Fast and Prayer-days are order'd to be kept, that the Inhabitants may humbly beg of God for his merciful Assistance. Besides, at such an ac∣cident they abstain not from Meat and Drink; but take it, and give Thanks to God for it. Distinction of Diet is never observ'd by them. Moreover, the <HI>Holland</HI> Teachers are call'd <HI>Ministers,</HI> which are Men that from their In∣fancy have been brought up to learn the <HI>Latin, Greek,</HI> and <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongues, and in Publick Churches Preach to the People out of the foremention'd Books, which every one may peruse, that thereby it may appear if their Doctrine agree with them.

<P><HI>Schaep</HI> reply'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Answers.</NOTE> <Q>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> depend on One God, and a Perfect Savi∣or; but the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Castilians</HI> place Gods Vicegerent on Earth, and Saints and Saintesses, which assist the Savior in his chiefest Business of Sal∣vation, in praying for those that are dead. Moreover, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Religion is older than the <HI>Portuguese</HI> or <HI>Castilians,</HI> because it agrees with the two Prophetick and Apostolick Books, without adding to, or diminishing from them: So that although the <HI>Portuguese</HI> brag, that their Religion was publickly embrac'd and taught in the Churches in <HI>Holland,</HI> before the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> banish'd the same from thence; yet the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Opinion hath been before the <HI>Portuguese:</HI> For that Faith which is now embrac'd, was the first that <HI>Holland</HI> entertain'd; and although oppress'd by bloody Persecutions, yet flouris'd again at last.</Q></P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> ask'd, <Q>Is <HI>Java</HI> a great Island? Who possesses it? What kind of Inhabitants are there? What Colour, and what, Names?</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of <HI>Java.</HI></NOTE> Captain <HI>Schaep</HI> reply'd, <Q>This Island is divided into <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Little Java:</HI> The biggest is separated by the <HI>Straights of Sunda</HI> from <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and spreads it self in length a hundred and fifty Leagues, but much less in breadth, yet broader in some places than in others. According to the Relation of the Inhabitants, a River flows in the middle of it, which turns Wood into Stone. The <HI>Mataram,</HI> an Enemy to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> possesses the greatest part thereof to the East: The King of <HI>Bantam,</HI> oftentimes at Alliance with the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, Commands a vast Tract along the <HI>Straights of Sunda.</HI> Betwixt both of them lies <HI>Batavia,</HI> where the President and Chief Governor

<P>After this Answer, <HI>Schaep</HI> and <HI>Byleveld</HI> were commanded to depart; and be∣ing conducted out to their Countreymen the other Prisoners, who had with a longing desire staid to hear the Success, found with them four and thirty <HI>Ja∣panners,</HI> Prisoners; of which, some sat Hand-cufft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange <HI>Japan</HI> Prisoners▪</NOTE> others had their Arms tied together under their Coats; and talking, seem'd as if they rail'd and complain'd against their hard usage.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">News of <HI>Elserak</HI>'s arri∣val.</NOTE>Whilst they staid here, <HI>Phatsayosamon</HI>'s Servant brought News of the Am∣bassador <HI>Elserak,</HI> that on the Morrow against Noon he would come with his Retinue to <HI>Jedo.</HI> This was told to <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> by the Masters Son of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Inn: upon which News, the <HI>Japan</HI> Council rose.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the first of <HI>December, Schaep</HI> sent privately for the Interpreter <HI>Kytsbyoye,</HI> to whom he gave two Letters, inclos'd one within the other, containing their several Examinations before the Council, to deliver to <HI>Elserak,</HI> that he might take notice thereof, and govern himself accordingly.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Byleveld</HI>'s Auswer to him.</NOTE><HI>Byleveld</HI> reply'd, saying, <Q>The third of <HI>February,</HI> in this present Year, <HI>Ca∣strecom</HI> and <HI>Breskens</HI> left <HI>Batavia,</HI> steering their Course to <HI>Ternata,</HI> with inten∣tion to seek for <HI>Tartary.</HI> When we went to Sea, we had no Company but <HI>Castrecom,</HI> with which Ship we Anchor'd, after five and forty days Sail, un∣der the Castle <HI>Maleyen:</HI> The fourth of <HI>April</HI> we proceeded on in our Voy∣age, and kept continually close together till the nineteenth of <HI>May,</HI> when in the Night we were driven by stress of Weather on an unknown Coast, lying in about four and thirty Degrees, where we lost <HI>Castrecom:</HI> We cannot give any Relation what Coast it was, because we hapned to fall upon it in the Night, and had as much as ever we could do, to keep our Ship from running ashore; in which endeavor we had such good success, that in the Morning the Land was seven Leagues astern of us, so that we could not discern it perfectly. We discover'd no Land betwixt <HI>Ternata</HI> and the said Coast. Moreover, so soon as we mist <HI>Castrecom,</HI> we ran towards the North-East Point of <HI>Japan,</HI> to look for him, according to the Letter of Agreement made at <HI>Ternata.</HI> We came on the <HI>Japan</HI> Coast the nine and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> where after twelve days we entred the Haven <HI>Namboe,</HI> but went away again the next day, so soon as ever the fresh Water which we came for was Shipp'd aboard, and stood directly East into the <HI>Offin,</HI> so to Weather the South-East Point of <HI>Japan,</HI> having as we judg'd Sail'd two hundred Leagues, when the violent South-winds, and as strong Storms from the North, so distress'd us, though we had sometimes sight of <HI>Japan,</HI> that we fell a whole Degree more Northerly than we expected.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Earthquake at <HI>Jedo.</HI></NOTE>¶ THey were possess'd with these melancholy Thoughts, when on a sudden the Earth was shaken, the Timbers and Roofs of Houses tumbling down to the Ground, the Walls falling one towards another, and much harm in those places where the Motion was greatest.</P>
<P>It is approv'd of by the most Learned Philosophers, and Experience hath
<PB REF="229"/>
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="230"/>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="231"/>
<PB N="383" REF="231"/>taught us, That the greatest Earthquakes happen in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> be∣cause those times produce the greatest Vapors; whereas in the Summer, the Earth being open'd by warmth, affords free passage for the Winds that lye in its Caverns. In the Winter time the Ground is lock'd, and the Warmth too weak to occasion great Shakings.</P>
<P>Moreover there are reckon'd three sorts of Earthquakes. The greatest is a Gaping, which often swallows up Houses, Villages, whole Countreys, and Islands. The great Lakes and bottomless Waters in <HI>Japan,</HI> hide under them formerly famous Places and People, and thereby testifie enough how this Em∣pire is plagu'd by such Evils. For the second, the Learned reckon that which shakes the Earth, heaving it up and down, and shakes that which is on the top thereof, in such a manner, that all things tremble and fall down. The third and smallest is, when the Ground moves to and again, like a Boat on the Waves. Such a one was this that hapned at <HI>Jedo</HI> whilst the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fore-running Signs thereof.</NOTE>It hath also often before, as well as now, been observ'd, That a little be∣fore the Earthquake the Air was very calm, the Winds being lock'd in the Bosom of: the Earth: The Air is also colder than at other times it us'd to be in that Season of the year, which hinders the breaking forth of the Winds: There likewise appear'd a long thin Cloud in the Sky: The Sea rag'd ex∣ceedingly, notwithstanding there was no Wind stirring: All Pools and sand∣ing Waters stunk very much; and the Water it self tasted of Brimstone.</P>
<P>This the Learned <HI>Gerard Vossius</HI> ascribes to the Fire which is under Ground, and lies hid in deep places, under Mountains, Islands, and Seas, by which the Earth also is shaken many Miles together; so that not only, Cities, Villages, Territories, but whole Countreys, are totter'd, and turn'd topsie-turvey by it.</P>
<P>This Fire vomits out many sulphurous and burning Vapors, which Experi∣ence hath taught us, because the Earth often rending asunder in Earthquakes, sends forth hideous Flames. The Fountains also smell sulphury, because the Spirits ascending, mix themselves with the Water.</P>
<P>By this Sign <HI>Phracides,</HI> Master to <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> the <HI>Lacedemonian,</HI> foretold of an approaching Earthquake, which he judg'd would be terrible,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plin.</HI> lib. 2. cap. 79.</NOTE> because the Wa∣ters tasted exceedingly of Brimstone.</P>
<P>Hereto is added, That the Countreys in which Burning Mountains are found, are most subject to such Damages. <HI>Josephus Acosta</HI> relates the like of <HI>America;</HI> and our daily Experience of <HI>Campania, Sicily,</HI> and other Places, where∣in Mountains either vomit forth continual Smoke, or hideous Flames, confirms this Opinion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burning Mountain in <HI>Ja∣pan.</HI></NOTE>About eight Leagues from <HI>Meaco,</HI> near a great Lake, lies the Mountain <HI>Si∣urpurama,</HI> which sends forth horrible Smokes and Flames, that ascend into the Sky; and below, several Sulphurous Streams.</P>
<P><HI>Sicily</HI> is at the present less troubled with Earthquakes than formerly, because the Vent or Hale of Mount <HI>Aetna</HI> being burnt wider and wider, affords a freer Passage to the Vapors and the Fire.</P>
<P>Before the burning of the Mountain <HI>Vesuvius,</HI> where <HI>Pliny</HI> died, a great Earthquake hapned. It is also obferv'd by the <HI>Japanners,</HI> That the Mountain <HI>Saperjama</HI> burns vehementest after an Earthquake.</P>
<PB N="384" REF="232"/>
<P>¶ THe eighth of <HI>December</HI> the imprison'd <HI>Hollanders</HI> were inform'd by the Interpreter <HI>Phatsyosamon,</HI> That <HI>Elserak</HI> was that day to appear before the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor, and his Council; and that then they should have their free Liberty: But no sooner was <HI>Phatsayosamon</HI> gone, but the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had or∣der to dress themselves.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollanders</HI> appear in the Emperors Castle.</NOTE> Their Landlords Son conducted them along, with∣out telling them whither, or what they were going about: So passing from Street to Street through <HI>Jedo,</HI> they came at last to the Emperors Castle, which is surrounded with four Moats, over which they pass'd through ten stately Gates; and coming within next to an Arch, whereof the Floor was cover'd with Mats, they receiv'd order to stay, till they were call'd to appear before his Imperial Majesty.</P>
<P>Soon after, they saw the two Interpreters, <HI>Tosaymon</HI> and <HI>Manikebe,</HI> coming thither; and also, amongst other Courtiers, a Gentleman call'd <HI>Pochycennemon∣donne,</HI> who shew'd them a great Wooden Portal, through which they should be carried to the Emperor <HI>Owysamma.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Magnificence of it.</NOTE> And whilst they staid waiting at the foresaid Place, they saw with admira∣tion a great many Lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civility of the Courtiers.</NOTE> Secretaries, and other Nobles, which continually pass'd to and fro, shewing such Reverence one to the other, that they exceed∣ed the most Complimental People in that kind.</P>
<P>At last <HI>Pochycennemondonne</HI> brought the <HI>Hollanders</HI> over a broad Court, pav'd with Free-stone, through the Portal which he had shewn them, before a rich gilded Gallery, where they were commanded, after the <HI>Japan</HI> manner, to kneel, with their Faces bow'd down to the Ground. Soon after they espied the chief Councellors of <HI>Japan,</HI> and the Ambassador <HI>Elserak,</HI> in the fore-mention'd Gal∣lery. <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> speaking in the Emperors behalf, said to <HI>Elserak;</HI> <Q>Not∣withstanding the ten <HI>Hollanders</HI> here present deserve to be punish'd, because they Cruised several days on the <HI>Japan</HI> Coast, as if they had some private Design; and also for Firing their Guns in the Haven of <HI>Namboe,</HI> to the great amazement of the good Inhabitants: Yet since they manifest their Inno∣cency, and since your Words agree with theirs, the Emperor sets them at li∣berty, and gives the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to you, upon Proviso, That you be bound for them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollanders</HI> are set at li∣berty by the Emperor but upon provisoes.</NOTE> if at any time certain Information be brought against them, That they design'd any thing against the <HI>Japan</HI> Empire.</Q> Which <HI>Elserak</HI> accepted, as also the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who were commanded by <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> to promise, That they would be ready to come from <HI>Holland,</HI> to appear before the Magistrates of <HI>Japan,</HI> if they at any time should be accus'd, that they had any Design upon that Empire. Lastly, <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> said, <HI>Well, the Emperor</HI> Owisamma <HI>discharges you from your Imprisonment; Be at liberty.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exceeding joy of the <HI>Hol∣landers.</HI></NOTE>They seem'd by this saying to be rais'd from death, and were amaz'd, part∣ly at their delivery from so long and dangerous an Imprisonment, and partly at the inexpressible Glory and Riches which they there beheld.

<P><HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> after he had subdu'd most part of <HI>Asia,</HI> and was become Master of the <HI>Persian</HI> Power, would have denied Humane Frailty, and was ambitious to be honor'd as a God.

Of which the Holy Scripture saith thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Reg.</HI> 10. <HI>v.</HI> 16, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7, 8, 19, 20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>And King</HI> Solomon <HI>made two hundred Targets of beaten Gold: six hundred Shekels of Gold went to one Target. And he made three hun∣dred Shields of beaten Gold, three Pound of Gold went to one Shield; and the King put them in the House of the Forest of</HI> Lebanon. <HI>Moreover the King made a great Throne of Ivory, and overlaid it with the best Gold. The Throne had six Steps, and the top of the Throne was round behind: and there were Stays on either side on the place of the Seat, and two Lions stood beside the Stays. And twelve Lions stood thereon, on the one side and on the other, upon the six Steps: there was not the like made in any Kingdom. And all King</HI> Solomon<HI>'s Drinking-Vessels were of Gold, and all the Vessels of the House of the Forest of</HI> Lebanon <HI>were of pure Gold, none were of Silver, it was nothing account∣ed of in the days of</HI> Solomon.</P>
<P>But though <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Riches and Splendor could not be parallell'd in those Times; yet were he now in being, he could not compare to the <HI>Japan</HI> Empe∣ror. It cannot be describ'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Splendor of the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor, when he gives Audience to Ambas∣sadors, or his Substitute Kings.</NOTE> in what a proud and haughty manner he gives Audience to Foreign Ambassadors, and his Substitute Kings, which come by turns from the Eastern and Western parts of <HI>Japan</HI> before his Throne.</P>
<P>Along the inner Wall of the Court stand stately Watch-houses, built like Galleries. In the Front thereof hangs the Emperors Flag, under which stands a Pike-man, who keeps Sentinel. In the Gallery sit the Soldiers, who spend most of their time with a Game call'd <HI>Pifango,</HI> not much unlike our Draughts, which requires much Consideration and Care. They also smoke strong To∣bacco. Along the Walls, upon Wooden Hooks, lye their Muskets and Pikes. The lowermost Edge of the Roof is adorn'd with Golden Balls. Before the tenth inner Gate stand the Overseers of the Court, which receive the Presents of the <HI>Japan</HI> Kings and Foreign Ambassadors, brought thither on Horses and Wains: Their Servants open the Goods.</P>
<P>At the Gate stand two of the Emperor's Deputy-Secretaries, which write down and take an account of every Piece of what shall be shewn to the Empe∣ror; which done, they are put into the Store-houses that joyn next the Gate, which are built secure against all Fire. On the corners of the Roofs lie Couch∣ant Dragons, all gilded, whose foremost Feet lye upon Golden Balls. Here is generally great crowding; some carrying the Presents in, others carrying them out, and others putting them in good order in the Store-houses. Through the said Portal appears the Rail, by which the Imperial Throne is separated from the open Court. One side of the Throne is guarded by Musketeers, and the other by Pike-men. Just before the Throne is a large and spacious Field, about which stand high Watch-Towers, built on the Out-wall of the third inner Court. Next the Towers are stately Gates, both sides thereof guarded with Watch-houses, built long-ways on square Pillars. More inwardly ap∣pear exceeding high Towers, which the thick Walls of the second inner Court bear, not without marvellouss Art and Charges. Before every Tower is a Watch-house, shut round about: The lower Edges of the Roof are adorn'd with Golden Balls. In this place the Chief of the Nobility keep Watch. On the sides you walk through the Gates of the second Inner-Court. The Emperor sits under a Pent-house of his Banquetting-Turret, from which a Way through a Door leads to the Throne, whose Supporters on both sides, and upper parts, are adorn'd with curious Imagery of massie Gold. Right before the Door, behind the Emperor, sit four Lords, which are nearest al∣lied to him in Blood: As many of the Chief Council stand on the right side
<PB N="386" REF="235"/>of the Throne; and on the left side, four Nobles of State: All of them drest in Princely Apparel, sit so low, that they can just look on the Ground of the Throne. Behind the Councellors, Nobles of State, and Lords allied in Blood, stand about three hundred of the other Nobility of <HI>Japan,</HI> which encompass the Throne like a Half-Moon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Costly Roof of the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperors.</NOTE>The Roof under which the Emperor sits, is cover'd with Plates of Gold: At each of the two Corners lies a great Dragon Couchant, of massie Gold. The Cieling represents all manner of Imagery, wrought in Gold, and in some places adorn'd with Precious Stones. This Covering rests on four thick Co∣lumns, no less beautiful than marvellous: The first is adorn'd with the Pi∣ctures of the Heavenly Luminaries; the second, with all manner of known Beasts which live on the Earth; on the third are wrought Fishes, and all other Creatures that reside in the Water; on the fourth, are inlaid Fiery Dragons and Serpents of Gold.</P>

Right forward rise the Steps which ascend to the Throne, which being seven in number, are all cover'd with rich Tapestry.

<P>Their Emperor never appears, but he is dreaded for his Power, and reve∣renc'd for his Magnificent Splendor, which so dazzles the Eyes of the Behold∣ers, that no Subject, nay Prince, or King, that doth not fear and tremble at his Authority; much less dare they offer to Plot or Rebel against him. And indeed, who would not be terrified, where the Sword being drawn, punishes the least Offence offer'd against the Supreme Power; and destroys not onely the Malefactor and his whole Family, but his Relations to the third Genera∣tion? Who would not be afraid of such a Commander, before whom the pow∣erfullest Kings in <HI>Japan</HI> fall down on the Earth?

<P>¶ NOt far from this City (as generally through all <HI>Japan</HI>) were seen several Burying-places, or Tombs, on which the <HI>Japanners</HI> bestow great Cost and Charges, as indeed most People do in <HI>Europe:</HI> Wherefore the <HI>Heathens</HI> ac∣counted them barbarous that misus'd dead Corps: Of which the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Writers accuse the <HI>Lotophagi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The strange Dealings and Cruelty of some People, us'd to their dead Corps.</NOTE> which threw their Dead without Chests or Coffins, into the Sea; judging it to be all one, if they rotted in the Earth, or whether they were consum'd by Fire, or decay'd in the Water. The <HI>Sabeans</HI> cast their deceased Friends, nay their Kings dead Bodies, on the Dunghils. The <HI>Taxili, Iberi,</HI> and <HI>Brachmans</HI> gave departed Corps to the Crows and Ra∣vens to eat. This Custom also was observ'd by the <HI>Barchaei;</HI> but onely to Va∣liant Men, that were slain in the Wars: Those that died a natural Death, they burnt. The <HI>Parthians</HI> gave the Flesh of the Dead to Dogs, onely burning the Bones. The <HI>Hyrcanians</HI> in their Life-time bred up great Mastiffs, that when they died they might be eaten by them. The <HI>Essedons</HI> brought their de∣parted Friends Bodies out at their Doors, where calling their nearest Relations together, they cut the Corps asunder; so mixing and boyling it amongst Sheeps Flesh, they eat it, as a Solemn Funeral Feast. The <HI>Massagetes</HI> carbona∣do'd their Dead also, and eat them. The ancient <HI>Jeren</HI> accounted it Religious to feed upon the Flesh of their Deceas'd Friends, Parents, and Relations. The <HI>Dervices</HI> slew all their Men and Women before their Altars, when they came to seventy years of age. The <HI>Hyperboreans</HI> made Feasts for their dead Bodies, hanging Garlands about their Necks, at last throwing them from the Rocks into the Sea. On the Island <HI>Code,</HI> those that attain'd to sixty years were forc'd to drink Poyson, because their Provisions should not grow scarce. The <HI>Caspians,</HI> so soon as their Fathers and Mothers were seventy years old, lock'd them into a Chamber, or drove them to desolate and uninhabited Wil∣dernesses, that there they might die of Hunger.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable Ceremonies us'd about the burning of Beasts.</NOTE>¶ BUt although these People wanted Humanity, acting such unnatural things with their Dead; yet others have bestow'd vast Charges on their Funerals; nay some have not stuck with prophaneness to erect Monu∣ments for their Beasts, of which <HI>Lacys</HI> was one, who with great Ceremony Entomb'd a Goose, that whilst it liv'd would not go from him. <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> made a sumptuous Feast at the Death of his Horse <HI>Bucephalus.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Angustus,</HI> and after him <HI>Adrianus</HI> and <HI>Commodus,</HI> built every one for their dead Horses a stately Marble Tomb. <HI>Cimon</HI> and <HI>Xantippus,</HI> famous Gene∣rals amongst the <HI>Greeks,</HI> Interr'd their Dogs with Funeral Ceremonies.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Men.</NOTE>Yet far greater Cost was bestow'd on the Burying of Men. How famous is the Tomb which <HI>Artemisia</HI> erected for her deceas'd Husband <HI>Mausolus?</HI> The Stones thereof were all Marble; it contain'd in the Circumference four hun∣dred and eleven Foot, and five and twenty in Height, surrounded by twenty six curiously ingraven Pillars. The famous Architects, <HI>Scopas, Briar, Timothe∣us,</HI> and <HI>Leocares,</HI> had scarce finish'd every one their Parts, when <HI>Artemisia</HI> died, after having burnt the Bones of her Husband to Powder, and drank them up, and spent all her Revenues on the before-mention'd Structure.</P>
<P>Who hath not heard of the famous Pyramids, which were the Burying-pla∣ces for the Kings of <HI>Egypt?</HI> of which three are yet remaining: The greatest is square, and runs up sloaping; yet on the top so broad, that there may stand fifty Men: The breadth from one corner to another, at the bottom, being three hundred twenty four Paces, and rising aloft with two hundred and fifty Steps, every Step five Foot high, and each Foot nine Inches long. At each of the four Corners is a low Descent, to which none can go but stooping. <HI>Pe∣ter Belloon</HI> relates, That he found this Pyramid, <HI>Anno</HI> 1548. built within after this manner: Creeping through a narrow Passage, with a Wax Candle in his Hand, he came into an empty Room, where turning on the left Hand, they found a spacious Place, to which a curious Gallery led the way: The Gallery was pav'd with great Free-stones, curiously polish'd, without Steps, so that he was forc'd to support himself by the Rails on both sides, after which man∣ner he ascended sixteen Paces; at the end of which appear'd a handsom square Chamber, in which stood a Chest of twelve Foot long, five high, and as ma∣ny broad, without a Cover, hewn out of one entire piece of black Marble, wherein the <HI>Egyptian</HI> King lay Interr'd that built this Pyramid: Besides these, he found several other Apartments, and also a Well fill'd with Stones.</P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Athenians</HI> made so much ado about the Burying of their Dead, that they condemn'd ten Commanders, because they neglected to do that Office to two departed Soldiers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hebrews</HI> neglected not to bury their Enemies.</P>
<P>The famous <HI>Roman</HI> Orator <HI>Paulus</HI> accounts it Death for those that dig up dead Bodies out of the Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander the Great</HI> kept so magnificent a Funeral in <HI>Babylon</HI> for <HI>Hephestion,</HI> that the Charges amounted to six hundred Tun of Gold.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the Ancients bestow'd great Sums of Money on Pillars, Ima∣ges, Coffins, Imbalmings, and other strange Ornaments, with which they adorn'd the Burying-places, every one according to his Capacity. This anci∣ent Custom is yet observ'd amongst the <HI>Japanners,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> burn their Dead.</NOTE> where the Bodies being burnt after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, they lay the Ashes under stately Tombs.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the <HI>Romans</HI> have not always burnt their Dead; for their ancient Law commanded, <HI>Bury none in the City, nor burn none. Cornelius Sylla,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> General, was the first that order'd his Body to be burnt, fearing some might out of revenge do to him what he had done to <HI>Marius,</HI> whose Bones he digg'd up, and threw into the River <HI>Anienis.</HI> After that, the <HI>Romans</HI> us'd only Funeral Pyres; which Custom decay'd and became void in the Emperor <HI>An∣toninus</HI> his Reign, he commanding again, That the Dead should be buried in great State, and have costly Tombs erected over them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their remarkable and strange Ceremonies used about the Dead.</NOTE>The <HI>Roman</HI> Pride in those Affairs, the <HI>Japanners</HI> have taken an exact Pattern by: for when a Person dies, they set the Corps on a Bier, with his Head bow'd forwards, and his Hands folded together, in a praying Posture, clad in
<PB N="390" REF="239"/>White, over which hangs a Paper Coat, pasted together, whereon is written the Religion of that Idol whom the deceas'd honor'd and worshipp'd. In this posture four Men carry it out of the City to the Fire; then a great number of his Relations and Friends, which attended the Corps, stand round about the Fire, and call a whole Hour together on the Name of the Idol, whether <HI>Amida, Xaca, Canon,</HI> or any other, to whose Service in his Life-time the Departed was most devote; whilst the <HI>Bonzies</HI> play, making a horrible noise, by striking on Copper Kettles and Basons. The Pit wherein the Fire is made, is square, hung round about with Mats, and hath an Entrance that opens towards the four Winds: The Pit it self fill'd full of Wood, which is cover'd with a Sail. On both sides thereof stand Tables, fill'd with Meats, all dress'd in Blood, and Vessels fill'd with Perfumes; and next them, lie great Heaps of Sweet-wood. When the Bier with the Corps approaches, they fasten a long Rope about it, on which every one that can come near lays his Hand, and call all together on the Name of the Deceased's Idol. Thus they carry the Body three times about the Pyre, on the Shoulders of four Men: At last setting the Bier with the Corps on the Pile of Wood, the chief <HI>Bonzie</HI> waves a lighted Torch three times over the dead Bodies Head; which done, he throws it away; but it is taken up again by the nearest of the Deceaseds Relations, of which one stands on the East, and the other on the West side of the Bier. Three times they give it from one to the other over the Corps; then they set Fire on the Pile of Wood, whilst others that stand next to them pour Oyl and Essences thereon; so that the Flame suddenly ascends the Sky, and consumes the dead Body to Ashes.</P>
<P>Mean while, the Children and nearest Relations go to the Tables, kindle the Vessels with Perfumes, and shew Worship to him that is burnt: Which done, every one returns home; onely the Common People that follow'd the Corps, make themselves merry about the Fire, with the Meat that stands on the two Tables by the Funeral Pit.</P>
<P>The next day the nearest Allies return again to the Fire, and there gather the Ashes, Teeth, and Bones into a gilded Urn, which carrying home, they set in a private Chamber, and cover with a rich Cloth. Seven days together they mourn, accompanied all the time with some of the <HI>Bonzies,</HI> who receive great Rewards for the time they spend in such Services. On the seventh day the gilded Urn is Interr'd without the City, in the place where the Body was burnt; which done, they spare no Cost nor Charges in erecting a stately Mo∣nument.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Japan</HI> Burying-places.</NOTE>First great Stones are laid over the gilded Urn, sometimes three-square, sometimes after an oval fashion, and at other times with several Corners. The Sides thereof are Ingraven with curious Imagery; either a Lion-Ram∣pant, making towards a <HI>Japanner,</HI> that holds his Swords in his Hand, ready to resist him; or of Armed Men, deeply engag'd in a Battel; or else of Flow∣ers, which are commonly the Graves of Women. On these Stones are square or round Marble Pillars, on which are ingraven in <HI>Japan</HI> Characters, his Birth∣day, his Life, Imployment, and other Atchievements, and the time of his Death, whose Bones lye there Interr'd.</P>
<P>Next these Graves are to be seen the Representation of the Idol worshipp'd by the Deceas'd, which are generally cut to the life out of Marble. Then are there Men and Womens Pictures, sitting after the <HI>Japan</HI> manner, with their Legs across under them, every one dress'd in fashionable Apparel; the Men
<PB N="391" REF="239"/>holding their Hands together in a praying posture: The Women, on the contrary, hold theirs asunder, and look side-ways over their Shoulders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of <HI>Siquani,</HI> the deceas'd Childrens Idol.</NOTE>¶ MOreover, you do not onely meet with very costly Tombs in <HI>Japan,</HI> but also large Temples dedicated to their Gods that rule over the Dead.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Osacca</HI> is a stately Temple, where the Idols <HI>Jene</HI> and <HI>Siquani</HI> are worshipp'd by all Mourners. This Idol <HI>Sequani</HI> sits on a round Pedestal, cover'd with a Scollopp'd Cushion adjoyning to which, a silver Parrot ap∣pears on a Pearch. The Face of the Image represents a Youths; the Hair of the Head ty'd behind with a String of Pearls, one Lock being curl'd, standing upright: His four Arms are cover'd with wide Sleeves, full of sparkling Stars: About his right Arm a Serpent is twisted, whose Head he holds aloft in his Hand: From the Elbow of this Arm grows another, which embracing a young Child, squeezes it against his Breast: In his left Hand he holds a Scymiter, in a ready posture to fight: Half from the left Arm appears a second, with the Hand downwards, holding a round String with Beads. The Child looks stedfastly towards the Sword, with his Hands folded together, and with his Legs across under him, sits on <HI>Siquanies</HI> wide Breeches.</P>
<P>But the Idol <HI>Jene</HI> is held in great Adoration by the tenth Sect of the <HI>Bonzie.</HI> He sits in State on a High Altar, which is curious to behold; for at every corner stands a square Pillar, a little distance from the Altar, and is joyn'd Arch-wise to the uppermost Ledge thereof, which is engraven with Stars, and other Curiosities, and the Spaces betwixt, full of <HI>Japan</HI> Characters. On every corner of the Altar stands a flat Dish; onely behind the Idol, towards the right side, stands a deep Platter, in which Perfumes are continually burnt. The Plates serve to hold the Money which the People offer. In the middle, <HI>Jene</HI> sits on a round Scollop'd Cushion, being represented with four Bearded Faces, the Heads whereof are all joyn'd together behind: He wears a Golden Crown, with seven Spires, on whose tops are round Balls full of Diamonds. On his Breast hangs a double String of Pearls, and at the end thereof a Rose of Diamonds: His left Arm he holds aloft, and his folded Hand grasps a Staff, which he sticks into a Sun: From this Arm hangs a second downwards, in the Hand holding a pleited Garland. In the uppermost right Hand is a <HI>Japan</HI> Plant; but that which points downwards, thrusts a Golden Staff into the Smoke over the Perfuming Vessel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Idol <HI>Jene</HI> rules over an∣cient deceas'd People.</NOTE>This their Idol, as they say, rewards Good and Bad after Death: To him are the Souls of aged and married People committed: Wherefore those that mourn for their Fathers, Mothers, Wives, Husbands, or any other near Rela∣tions, come in great numbers to this Temple, to offer for the Departed Souls on <HI>Jene</HI>'s Altar.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jene</HI>'s Temple.</NOTE>Moreover, this Temple is always kept lock'd; for the Image stands in an open place, under the azure Canopy of Heaven, between the Temple and the <HI>Bonzies</HI> Habitation, which look after the performance of their Divine Service to <HI>Jene.</HI> Before the Temple is a square Portal, on whose Roof at each end rise two Spires, of an exceeding height.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Find it convenient to send an Embassy, in return of thanks to the <HI>Japan</HI> Em∣peror.</NOTE>¶ THe <HI>East-India</HI> Company took this Letter into serious consideration, and at last concluded to requite the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor by a peculiar Embassy for his Mercy shewn to the Imprison'd <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and his usual civility to their People and Commerce at <HI>Nangesaque.</HI> To make the Embassy the more accepta∣ble, they sent the Emperor for Presents, two Brass-Guns that carry'd a Shot of forty Pound weight, with Rammers, Spunges, and Charging-Ladles, a great Looking-Glass in an Ebony Frame, surrounded with small Looking-Glasses in Silver; nine Pieces of fine Cloth, of several Colours; one great Prospective Glass, inclos'd in a Gold Enammell'd Case, and one Surratish Alcative.</P>
<P>On this Order from the <HI>United Netherlanders, Cornelius Vander Liin,</HI> Governor in <HI>Batavia,</HI> rested not, but Consulting with the Lords <HI>Francis Caron, Charles Reinerson,</HI> and <HI>Garret Demmer,</HI> concluded on the following Order, the seven and twentieth of <HI>June, Anno</HI> 1649. according to which Orders written down, the Ambassador <HI>Peter Blockhoffe,</HI> sent to <HI>Japan</HI> in the Ketch <HI>Robin,</HI> was to carry himself: The Contents these.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orders given by the <HI>In∣dian</HI> Councel, according to which the Ambassador must carry himself to the <HI>Japan∣ners.</HI></NOTE>¶ <Q>STeer your Course directly for <HI>Japan,</HI> and put not in for <HI>Formosa,</HI> nor any other Countrey, because it is already late in the Year, that you may not loose the usual Trade-Winds. In your Voyage, examine the Ships Company for Papist-Books, Pictures, or any other Trifles belonging to the, <HI>Roman</HI> Religion; and the more, because the <HI>Japan</HI> Councel strictly Examin'd if the Ship <HI>Breskens</HI> had not brought <HI>Portugal</HI>-Priests from the <HI>Manilla</HI>'s: When you come near the <HI>Japan</HI> Shore, you will get Waiters on Board, which you must entertain civilly. The Order which the <HI>Japan</HI> Governors or Comman∣ders give you, and also what the Interpreters and Servants to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, on the Island <HI>Disma,</HI> counsel you, you shall observe, and not fol∣low your own Inventions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When you are ready to go to <HI>Jedo,</HI> Clothe your Men in Blue Serge, which Apparel let them wear all their Journey, except when you go to any <HI>Japan</HI> Lord, or thorow a great City; then let your Attendance put on their Pink Colour'd Cloth Suits: When you go to speak with the Emperor or Com∣plement any of the Councel, then let your Retinue wear their best and rich∣est Liveries, being White and Red.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Be careful that you are not curious to see strange Novelties, except you are invited to it by Persons of Quality: At your first Arrival at <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> make the reason of your Embassy known to the Governors there, and ask Advice of <HI>Dirk Snoek,</HI> and <HI>Antony Brookhurst,</HI> and follow the counsel of the <HI>Japan</HI> Interpreters. You must learn the Words of the chief cause of your Embassy perfect, that you may say them by Rote; because when you appear before Persons of Quality, they privately Write them down, and after∣wards modestly ask the same Question again, to see if the last agree with the first.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Moreover, excuse your self to the <HI>Japan</HI> Lords, that you are a Stranger, and by that means, not knowing their Customs, entreat their favorable assistance thereof for the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, and Governor at <HI>Batavia,</HI> depend solely upon their Friendship: Shew them the Inventory of the Presents sent to the Emperor; with Intreaties, to find a means to convey them to him; proffer the Governor of <HI>Nangesaque</HI> some of them.</Q></P>
<PB N="395" REF="241"/>
<P><Q>If you should be ask'd at <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> or in the Emperors Court, or else∣where, In whose Name you perform this Embassy? What Authority and Power the <HI>East-India</HI> Company hath? What their Employment? If they have the Government in their own Hands? If the Presents came from the <HI>Ne∣therlands</HI> or from <HI>Batavia?</HI> If they are onely sent to the Emperor, or also to his Councel? Give them a short Answer to all their Questions; As for ex∣ample, The <HI>East-India</HI> Company consists of the Eminentest Persons of the se∣veral Cities in the <HI>United Netherlands;</HI> Drive a vast Trade through all the World, with the great Stocks that are laid up by the Company; They keep not one constant Government, but change sometimes: Add here, That you were sent thither by the said Company, to officiate in that Embassy, and to give the Presents made in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> to the Emperor; besides several Pieces of Cloth that were to be given to the <HI>Japan</HI> Lords, according as the Governor on the Island <HI>Disma</HI> shall judge, what every one likes best: When you speak, use but few Words, when with silence you cannot give satisfacti∣on; for otherwise Silence is no where so great a Vertue as in the presence of the <HI>Japan</HI> Lords. Present those Lords high that use to give Gifts to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, though you give away all the <HI>European</HI> Clothes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Concerning the Peace concluded between the <HI>United Netherlands, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> which they very much fear'd would be ill Resented by the <HI>Ja∣pan</HI> Emperor, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>Portuguese</HI> being his mortal Enemies: You may tell them, That according co the Relation spread some time since in <HI>Ja∣pan,</HI> all Christendom being tyr'd out with a long War, were now inclin'd to Peace; so that <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> had made a League of Amity with the Empe∣ror of <HI>Germany,</HI> in which League were included, <HI>Denmark, Poland,</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> onely <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> were at Wars against <HI>Spain,</HI> yet so, that two Medi∣ators were chosen for the deciding of the Differences, which without perad∣venture would be done in a short time, having already by woful experience tasted the Cruelty of a long War; whilst the <HI>Turk,</HI> a sworn Enemy to all <HI>Christians,</HI> had made himself Master of several Fortresses, Cities, and Territo∣ries. The Peace which the <HI>Christians</HI> make amongst themselves, is onely to joyn their divided Forces, and so United, ingage the <HI>Turks</HI> Army which con∣stantly lies on the <HI>Christians</HI> Borders.</Q></P>
<P>The remaining Orders which <HI>Blockhoffe</HI> was to observe were these: <Q>You must well consider of your Words before you speak them, and excuse your self, that being a Merchant you cannot give any great account concerning State-Affairs. The <HI>Japanners</HI> are subtle enough to know, that you do not come thither to give them an account of the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Government; in which Relation, some sought to gain Praise, but indeed had like to have spoil'd the business of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company by it; for indeed the <HI>Japanners</HI> despise a Common-wealth, and esteem no Government but sole <HI>Monarchy.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>When you are invited to Dinner to any Noble-man, be sparing in Drink∣ing, and also of your Words; speak little, when with silence you cannot give satisfaction; onely the returning of Thanks for good Entertainment, or Benefits receiv'd, repeat six or seven times over: Keep no Feasts, because the Conversation with <HI>Japanners</HI> is dangerous; yet if any Person of Quality hath a mind to <HI>Netherland</HI>-Meat, and desires to Eat thereof, refuse him not, but provide all things fit for his Entertainment, without sparing of Cost; and then go you and sit at the lower end of the Table, and thank your Guest for the Honor he hath done you by his Company.</Q></P>
<PB N="396" REF="242"/>
<P><Q>But to Citizens and Merchants observe your Authority as beseems your Office; follow the Advice of the Interpreters, which continually bear you company, and tell you how you must converse with Persons of Quality, and the rather, because the Interpreters are Politick-men, on which you may de∣pend, and because their own welfare consists upon the good Estate of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Feast the Ambassa∣dor must prepate for the <HI>Japan</HI> Lords.</NOTE> <Q>In the Interim, when you are return'd from <HI>Jedo</HI> to <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> and the Presents accepted by all Persons, then prepare a stately Dinner for the prime <HI>Japan</HI> Commanders there; you must on your Return at <HI>Jedo, Miaco,</HI> or <HI>Osacca,</HI> furnish your self with Wine, Salmon, Habberdine, Carps done in Rice, and a Crane, although he cost seventy Tail (every Tail is an <HI>English</HI> Crown) all which Meats must be well Salted, and Dress'd after the <HI>Japan</HI> manner; of which the Interpreters take great care.</Q></P>
<P><Q>So soon as you Land at <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> you shall bespeak for your self and every one of your Retinue, three pair of Buskins, and six Pair of thin Shoes of Drefs'd Buck-Skin, to use in your going and coming from Court; for the <HI>Japanners</HI> lay costly Mats on their Floors, which never are trode upon with Shooes; Boots and Spurs are not us'd in <HI>Japan.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Your self shall wear no Weapon, but your People must every one wear a Silver-Hilted Rapier, which they are carefully to preserve from Dirt and Rain, that the beauty thereof may not be gone when your People Wait in the Emperors Hall, whilst you are admitted to private Conference with the Emperor.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In <HI>Osacca</HI> furnish your self with <HI>Umbrello</HI>'s made of Yarn, every couple of your Retinue must have one of them, but each an Oyl'd Paper Cloak against the Rain, which in dry Weather are laid in Woodden Chests: You shall likewise buy in <HI>Osacca</HI> as many Wax'd Lethern-Portmanteaus as your Goods require: The Blankets, Cushions, and Quilts are in the day time Pack'd up, and carry'd on Horses, but at Nights spread on a Floor in your Inn to Sleep upon.</Q></P>
<P><Q>From the Accounts kept by those that Travel yearly to the Emperor, you may guess what you have to pay for the Meat which you have in your Inn; namely, to give them twenty Guilders when they ask ten, and a hundred when fifty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Moreover, <HI>Peter Blockhoffe</HI> shall have the upper hand of all the <HI>Japan</HI> Go∣vernors on <HI>Disma;</HI> and next the Merchants <HI>Dirk, Snock, Anthony Brockhurst,</HI> and <HI>Andrew Frisius</HI> shall keep their places according to their old Custom; but <HI>Blockhoffe</HI> is not to concern himself with the Trade, though it be requested from him by the <HI>Japanners;</HI> for he may excuse himself, that he comes onely to officiate an Embassy to the Emperor. The usual Presents must be double-divided, because last year, by an accident, they were not parted.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Before you go from <HI>Nangesaque</HI> to <HI>Jedo,</HI> desire the Governors there to give you Letters of Recommendation to <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> which when you give him, shew him the same Request as you did the Magistrates at <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> and humbly desire him, that he would be pleas'd to direct you, how, in what manner, and to whom the Presents must be given. Tell him that his Name is famous in all the <HI>Netherlands</HI> for his courteous Services shown to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company: Upon the delivery of the Presents, none shall appear be∣fore the Emperor, but <HI>Blockoffe</HI> and <HI>Frisius,</HI> your Retinue must stay in the Hall, as you will understand from the Interpreters.</Q></P>
<PB N="397" REF="242"/>
<P><Q>There hath oftentimes by the Emperors Command been Order given for a Mortar-Piece, which through urgent Occasions hath been neglected; but now acquaint him, that you have brought a Man (Experienc'd in that Art) thither for the Emperors Service; besides the foremention'd Presents for his Imperial Majesty, you have good store of fine light colour'd, black and red Cloth, besides Crown-Serges, ordinary Serge, and Damask, to bestow plen∣tifully on his Nobility. Excuse your self, that you give not richer Presents, because the <HI>East-India</HI> Company know not what was most acceptable to his Majesty and his Councel.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Before you appear to the Emperor, you will be Examin'd, What your Embassy is for? Reply, For nought else, but to thank the Emperor for his kind Delivery of the ten <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and to Extol his great Favors shown to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company in <HI>Japan. Andrew Frisius</HI> is order'd to be your Secreta∣ry, who is to keep a Journal of all daily Observations and Passages of Re∣mark, which deserve to be Register'd. <HI>John Hakkins</HI> shall be your Gentleman-Usher, and to prepare the Silver Vessel.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Take special care that none of your People debauch themselves with Drinking or Whoring, but punish them severely; let your People keep their Nails Cut, their Hair Comb'd, and wear clean Linnen, and Wash themselves in all places they can conveniently. The Load-stones which you have, the Physical Herbs, Spectacles, Prospective-Glasses, Tent, Wine, Cheese, <HI>Dutch</HI> Butter, Brazile Wood, <HI>Italian</HI> Earthen Ware, Barrels for Guns, and Multiply∣ing-Glasses, give some to every one that asks for them: The red Beads, give now and then to Noble-mens Children, their Servants, or your Landlords, as a thing to remember you by.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Concerning the Lord of <HI>Firando,</HI> who is Indebted twenty five Thousand Guilders to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, you must seriously advise about it with the Interpreters, if we should not incur the Displeasure of the <HI>Nangesaquean</HI> Magistrates; if the said Lord be Discharg'd from the Debt, because being Impoverish'd by Fire, he is not able to Pay. It would at least be a Courtesie that would Obliege the Lord of <HI>Firando;</HI> yet if the Interpreters should ad∣vise the contrary, <HI>Blockhoffe</HI> must follow their counsel, but give order, that the said Lord hereafter be no more ask'd for the Debt, as heretofore they had done yearly.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Your best Apparel, Silver-Work, and all things else which are for a shew, let them not be seen in the Streets, at your Table, nor Lodging-Rooms, un∣less to some Noble <HI>Japanners:</HI> Intreat by all means, that the Ship <HI>Robin</HI> may continue in the Haven of <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> till you have done your Embassy to the Emperor; that then you may come directly, without touching at <HI>Formosa</HI> or elsewhere, in her to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Holland,</HI> with the Fleet which goes thither in <HI>December,</HI> that the <HI>East-India</HI> Company may be inform'd by your self, concerning your Affairs with the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Remember your self likewise, that you never come before any Person of Quality with your Hat off, but to Common People you need not so much observe that State. Lastly, Because <HI>Blockhoffe</HI> went sick Aboard, <HI>Andrew Fri∣sius</HI> had strict Order, that if <HI>Blockhoffe</HI> should happen to die by the way, to preserve his Body by Embalming, that it might be seen by the <HI>Japanners</HI> that were so minded: For the making of the Coffin, the Master of the Ship had Wood provided for that purpose.</Q></P>
<PB N="398" REF="243"/>
<P><HI>Frisius</HI> sent to succeed <HI>Blockhoffe,</HI> was to observe all the foremention'd Orders exactly: Mean while, <HI>Blockhoffe</HI> dying on the way between <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Japan, Frisius</HI> and <HI>Brookhurst</HI> Officiated the Embassy, according to the Relation given you in the first Part.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Embassy of <HI>Zacha∣rias Wagenaer,</HI> to the Em∣peror of <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE>¶ SInce their being at <HI>Jedo,</HI> the Splendid Embassy of <HI>Zacharias Wagenaer</HI> is ve∣ry remarkable: The <HI>East-India</HI> Company are much concern'd for the Trade of <HI>Japan,</HI> notwithstanding they in Traffick, deliver and receive Goods through all <HI>India,</HI> and farther.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Javan</HI> Cities <HI>Bantam, Molassery, Charga, Bayas, Cuconu, Cherelas, Charita, Cheregin, Labnan, Buanium, Iscbongoir, Parmam</HI> and <HI>Punctam,</HI> Truck for <HI>Cormandel</HI> Cot∣ton against Pepper, <HI>Cubebes, Storax,</HI> and <HI>Cardamoms.</HI></P>

<P>These Islands barter for <HI>Jortan</HI> and <HI>Baleian</HI> Linnen, <HI>Cormandel</HI> Clothes, wove after the <HI>Maleian</HI> manner: and amongst Provisions in scarce Times, they ra∣ther desire Rice than Silver or Gold.</P>

<PB N="402" REF="245"/>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> accounted those fatal Days on which their Coun∣trey or City suffer'd any mischance: yet some of them despised this foolish Fancy; for <HI>Lucius Lucullus</HI> led his Army against <HI>Tigranes</HI> on the sixth of <HI>Novem∣ber,</HI> by the <HI>Romans</HI> accounted unfortunate to begin any weighty matter upon; yet it so fell out, that <HI>Lucullus</HI> with small Forces routed a great Army.</P>
<P>The <HI>Macedonians</HI> reckon'd the Moneth of <HI>June</HI> to be fatal: notwithstanding <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great sleighted that idle Opinion, when in <HI>June</HI> he encountred with the <HI>Persian</HI> King <HI>Darius.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> Marry many Women.</NOTE>¶ AS the <HI>Japanners</HI> with great state and sorrow keep the Day of the Empe∣ror's death, so likewise their Ceremonies of Marriage are perform'd in as great state and splendor, with unexpressible joy. It is the Custom in <HI>Japan,</HI> as in most Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> to Marry several Women; which Custom the <HI>Japanners</HI> have brought from <HI>China,</HI> where a Man is not bound to one Woman.</P>
<P>This unlimited lasciviousness took place in <HI>Asia</HI> many Ages since. And who knows not that the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Medes,</HI> nay the <HI>Israelites</HI> themselves, and mongst them the wisest of Kings, <HI>Solomon,</HI> were given over to that wanton Lust.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Where a Woman hath many Husbands.</NOTE>But if this Crime deserves to be punish'd, then we may condemn the foul Custom observ'd by the antient <HI>Arabs, Nebatheans,</HI> and <HI>Britains,</HI> namely, that one Woman was common to a whole Family; to which when any one went, he set his Stick up at the Door, as a sign, that at that time none might come in and concern himself with her, on punishment of Adultery.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Moors,</HI> as also the <HI>Garamanties</HI> and <HI>Liminiri,</HI> Lay with the Women by the
<PB N="403" REF="245"/>hundred, and after five years the Children begotten out of such a mixture were distributed, every man taking one which was most like him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Troglodites</HI> gave the betrothed Brides first to be known to the Bride∣grooms nearest Relations and Brothers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of some People about their Marriage.</NOTE>Yet though the <HI>Japanners</HI> take as many Women as they will, yet they hold one as their true and lawful Wife, which onely sits with her Husband at Ta∣ble, whilst the rest are like Servants. The Children also which he gets by his Concubines, at his Death get but very little of his Estate: for those that are born of his lawful Wife inherit all; Which Custom is also deriv'd from <HI>China;</HI> where the Emperor, before the <HI>Tartar</HI> made himself Master of that Empire, Marry'd besides his Empress, thirty other Women, being the most beautiful that could be found in all his Dominions of <HI>China:</HI> all which remain'd in the Palace till the Emperors Death; when his Successor, after the Burial of the deceased Emperor, Clothing the thirty Women in rich Apparel, carry'd them to his second Palace, there placing every one on a stately Throne: whereon sitting with their Faces cover'd, thirty <HI>Chinese</HI> Princes chosen by the Emperor, entred the Hall, every one of them taking one of the said Women by the Hand, and instantly Marry'd them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange kind of Marri∣age observ'd by the <HI>Ja∣panners.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Japanners</HI> observe chiefly, that the Brides and Bridegrooms differ not much in their Age, Estate, and Extract. The Betrothed are in the Morning early carry'd in costly Coaches, drawn either by Oxen or Horses from their Houses out of the City, accompanied with all manner of Vocal and Instrumental Musick to a high Hill, attended by a great number of People, and sometimes are so crowded, that they are forc'd to have Soldiers with them to clear the Way: After the Bridegroom's Coach▪ follow several Wayns loaden with Presents, with which he buys the Bride. Which Manner they have like∣wise brought out of <HI>China:</HI> for there the Man gives to the new marry'd Wo∣man divers Marriage Goods; which she delivers to her Father or Mother, as a requital for the bringing of her up; so that the chief Riches increase from the number of their Daughters, and chiefly when they are beautiful.</P>
<P>The antient <HI>Babylonians</HI> bringing their Daughters to Market at a certain time of the year, sold them to those that proffer'd most: the Price was set ac∣cording to their Beauty, those that were handsomest yielding the best Rate; and ordinary Faces were sold for lesser Sums: yet the homeliest also went off; for the Money which was bestow'd for the fairest, was given as Portions for the hard-favor'd; so that they in stead of being bought, they purchas'd Hus∣bands for themselves.</P>
<P>Far more shamefully did the <HI>Phoenician</HI> Maidens order their affairs, when they went into the Temple of <HI>Venus</HI> to proffer their Virginities to sale, and with that Money so gotten, bought them Husbands.</P>
<P>The same Custom was observed by the <HI>Cyprian</HI> Maids, who for Money pro∣stituted themselves so long to Strangers, till they had gotten Wealth enough to purchase Marriage with some of their election.</P>
<P>Nay, the <HI>Armenians</HI> had a Law, according to which the Maids in the antient Temple dedicated to the Goddess <HI>Anetis,</HI> whose Image was made of Massie Gold, should at a set time prostitute themselves in common to all Men; after which there were none but desir'd her in Marriage, that had been so consecra∣ted to the same Goddess.</P>
<P>The antient <HI>Indians</HI> brought their Daughters into the Company of fine Youths, that they might chuse one out of the number, which in Strength,
<PB N="404" REF="246"/>swiftness in Running, Wrestling, and well-timberdness of Body exceeded the other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cathaians</HI> observe the same manner, but upon inviolable promises, that she will be burnt with her Husbands Body, if he chance to die before her.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Women also leap into the same Funeral Fire; and those that out of fear do not go in to be burnt with their Husbands, are accounted dishonest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Laxamatees,</HI> near the Lake <HI>Meosis,</HI> may not Marry before they have slain an Enemy: and also the <HI>Carmani</HI> may not betroth themselves before they have brought an Enemy's Head to the King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Brides must bring Portions, but in <HI>Japan</HI> the Bridegrooms.</NOTE>The antient <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> maintain'd quite another Custom than the <HI>Japanners;</HI> for with them the Brides were to bring Portions to the Bridegrooms: wherefore the <HI>Roman</HI> Consul gave the Daughters of the famous Generals, <HI>Cneius Scipio,</HI> and <HI>Martus Curius,</HI> their Portions out of the Treasury, because being poor they could not be Marry'd according to their Birth.</P>
<P>The like did the <HI>Athenians</HI> to the Daughters of the valiant Heroe <HI>Aristides.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Solon</HI> and <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> both <HI>Greek</HI> Law-givers, commanded strictly, That no Bride should bring Money into the Bridegrooms Pocket.</P>
<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> took no Marriage to be lawful, unless the Man produced his promis'd Estate: Which Law was also observ'd by the <HI>Biskiners.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> never Marry'd for Estates; for if the Woman brought any Riches to the Man, then he, according to their Laws, was to be her Slave.</P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> durst not seem to Marry for Money: where∣fore those were severely punish'd, that at <HI>Lacedemon</HI> Courted <HI>Lysander</HI>'s Daugh∣ters, and after the Decease of their Father forbore their Suit; which the Judge interpreted thus: <HI>That they had not Courted the Persons, but their Money.</HI></P>
<P>Just so it is in <HI>Japan,</HI> where the Man Marries not onely a Bride without a Portion, but must give her divers Goods for Marrying of him: Which Cu∣stom is likewise Extracted from <HI>China;</HI> where the Bride brings no Money to her Bridegroom, though she carry all manner of Housholdstuff to his House, as Stools, Chairs, <HI>Umbrello's,</HI> and other things, sufficient to fill up a small Street; for it is all bought with the Money which the Bridegroom hath given her.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Confirming of Marria∣ges in <HI>Japan</HI> very remarka∣ble.</NOTE>Furthermore, the <HI>Japanners</HI> celebrate their Marriages in the following man∣ner: When the Bride approaches one side of the foremention'd Hill, she gets out of her Coach, and ascends the Steps that lead to the top thereof: On the other side the Bridegroom gets up; both their Attendants wait below, onely their Parents, with some Musicians ascend the Hill also by divided Steps; for in the middle thereof is a broad Rail, or Partition, both sides thereof on the top adorn'd with Golden Balls, by which those that get up, hold fast. The Bridegroom takes the right-hand of the Bride when he goes up the Stairs, and is follow'd by the Musicians: On the left-side the Bride walks up, accompa∣ny'd with her own and his Parents; on the top of the Hill their Parents stand behind the Bride, and the Musicians at some distance behind the Bridegroom; the Fathers and Mothers stand two and two under a Canopy, held over their Heads by their Servants; the Musicians on the one side are very busie, sitting flat on the Ground, and Play on a kind of Dulcimers, Citterns, Viols, but differ∣ing both in shape and sound from the <HI>Europeans;</HI> others stand before great Cop∣per Basons hanging by Chains under a sharp Roof, which rest on two Pillars; on these they strike with thick Pestles, according to the time of their several Tunes.

<P>Moreover, the Blessing which is spoke by the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> is of a very antient Ex∣tract: for the <HI>Israelites</HI> observ'd that Custom when the concern'd Parties in <HI>Beth-hillula,</HI> that is, <HI>A House of Praise,</HI> flock'd together, and sung joyful Hymns before the Bride and Bridegroom, the chief Priest taking a Cup full of Wine, said, <HI>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, which hast created joy and mirth, give love to the Bride and Bridegroom, a Brotherly inclination, peace, and quiet dwelling. I pray, O Lord, let there immediately he heard in the Cities of</HI> Juda, <HI>and in the Streets of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>the voice of the Bride and Bridegroom. The voice of joy and the Nuptial Bed is sweeter than any Feast, and Children more acceptable than the pleasing harmony of delightful Songs:</HI> then he gave the new Marry'd Couple the Cup.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Japanners</HI> Marry under the blue Ca∣nopy of Heaven.</NOTE>The present <HI>Jews</HI> also agree with the <HI>Japanners</HI> in this Point, performing the Ceremonies of Marriage, not in their Houses, but under a Tent, that so they may renew the Promise made to <HI>Abraham</HI> concerning the multiplying of his Seed. Therefore the Bridegroom goes out with the Priests, and the Bride fol∣lows, accompany'd with Vocal and Instrumental Musick, and Acclamations of the usual <HI>Baruch-habba,</HI> that is, <HI>Blessed is he that comes.</HI> The Bride coming near the Bridegroom, runs round about him, who follows after her; then both are strowed with Wheat, thereby to express the multiplying of their Seed; where∣fore the Guests cry whilst strowing, <HI>Increase and multiply:</HI> then they suddenly turn all their Faces towards the South. The Rabbies, or <HI>Jewish</HI> Teachers bles∣sing the Bride and Bridegroom, command them to drink out of a Flask with a narrow Neck, if she be a Maid; if a Widow, out of one with a wide mouth: then he thanks God for the perfecting of the Marriage, and gives another Glass to the new Marry'd Couple to drink out of it; which done, the Bridegroom breaks the Glass to pieces against the Wall or Ground, partly thereby to re∣member the ruine of the Temple in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and partly to shew the vanity of all transitory things.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further relation of the <HI>Japann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs</HI> Marriage.</NOTE>During the time that the <HI>Japanners</HI> are thus busie in perfecting the Marriage, there is no less stir amongst their Guests below about the Hill; some sitting
<PB N="406" REF="249"/>near the Wayns in which the Money lies for the Brides Portion; others make a great Fire, in which they throw all the Brides Play-things; others hold a Spinning-wheel aloft, and others a Bundle of Flax. This they seem to have borrow'd from the antient <HI>Romans,</HI> who carrying the Bride in the night-time on a Wayn to the Bridegrooms House, immediately gave her Flax, that so she might instantly learn what was to be done in Houshold affairs. Lastly, the <HI>Bonzies</HI> kill'd two <HI>Siam</HI> Oxen just before the Stairs that ascend up to the Hill, and some Sheep, which they sacrifice as a burnt-offering to their Nuptial God with a Dogs-head, that thereby they may receive his Blessing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> differ'd herein from the <HI>Japanners,</HI> that they worshipp'd not one peculiar Idol for Marriage, for they acknowledg'd several; so that a peculiar Deity was worshipp'd at their several Ceremonies of Marriage. The Idol <HI>Jugatinus</HI> was call'd upon when a Maid and Batchellor were betrothed to one another; <HI>Domiducus,</HI> whilst the Bride rode to the Bridegroom; <HI>Domitius,</HI> when the Bride entred the House; the Goddess <HI>Minturna,</HI> that the new Marry'd People might live long together; <HI>Virginiensis,</HI> when the Maiden Girdle was unty'd; <HI>Mutinus,</HI> when the Bride, being Chaste and Bashful, sat on a Mans Privacies made of Wood; <HI>Subigus,</HI> whilst she undrest her self; and <HI>Prema,</HI> the Goddes∣ses Mother, so soon as the Bridegroom was laid in Bed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Weddings, how kept.</NOTE>But after the finishing the foremention'd Ceremonies, the Bride at the giving of joy to the Marriage, being put into her Coach, is carry'd to the Bridegrooms House, her Ears all the way thither delighted with Vocal and Instrumental Musick, whilst the Youths are busie in the Bridegrooms House, in hanging out of Pendants and Flags from the Roof, strowing the Floors with Flowers, and every where, within and without about the Roof, hanging of Garlands. The Wedding generally lasting eight days, costs them great sums of Money.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Japanners</HI> Be∣troth their Children to one another.</NOTE>Moreover, the <HI>Japanners</HI> often betroth their Children whilst they are yet in the Cradle, which afterwards they inviolably perform. They also Marry ve∣ry young; but yet not so soon as the <HI>Muscovia</HI> Maids, which commonly enter the state of Matrimony in their tenth and eleventh Year, no otherwise than as if they were <HI>Egyptian</HI> Mice, which, as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith, come big with Young into the World.</P>
<P><HI>Joseph Scaliger</HI> relates, That a <HI>French</HI> Youth, aged eleven years, got his Neece of nine years old with Child.</P>
<P><HI>Hieronimus,</HI> that antient Father saith, That he saw a Girl that was big by a Boy scarce nine years old.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> makes himself an eye-witness, to have seen a Girl of seven years old, to be with Child by a Youth which was but two years older. And if any doubt the truth of these famous Persons, none will question the sacred Scrip∣ture, which saith plainly, That <HI>Achaz</HI> at the end of his eleventh Year had a Son, whom he call'd <HI>Hezekiah:</HI> for <HI>Achaz</HI> was made King in his twentieth Year, Govern'd <HI>Juda</HI> sixteen years; so that he died in the thirty sixth year of his age: at which time his Son <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was five and twenty years old; which being substracted from his Fathers thirty six, there remains no more than eleven when <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was born.</P>
<P>But besides the Nuptial God with a Dogs-head (which seems to be derived from <HI>Egypt,</HI> where there was scarce any Idol found but what had a Beasts Head; for <HI>Osiris</HI> in former times was there represented with an Ox-head; <HI>Pan,</HI> with a Bucks; <HI>Ammon,</HI> with a Rams; and <HI>Anubis,</HI> with a Dogs;) the <HI>Japanners</HI> also like the <HI>Chineses</HI> worship the Goddess <HI>Pussa,</HI> who is ador'd not onely for to

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Japan</HI> Goddess <HI>Pussa.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Bonzi</HI> relate this Story concerning the Goddess <HI>Pussa:</HI> Ten Ages ago three celestial Virgins nam'd <HI>Angela, Changela,</HI> and <HI>Fecula,</HI> descended from Heaven to bathe themselves in a pleasant Stream; who whilst they washed in the Brook spi'd a Tree, under whose Leaves, being longer and sharper than those of a Holm-Tree, hung a black Fruit upon long Stalks; which <HI>Fecula</HI> tast∣ing, found so exceeding pleasant, that she could not be satisfi'd with eating.</P>
<P>The like Story <HI>Homer</HI> relates of three Sea-men belonging to <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s Fleet, which going ashore where the <HI>Lotus</HI> grew, would not return, they being so much delighted with the tast of that Fruit.</P>
<P>Several Operations are ascribed to this Plant, as being good against the fall∣ing of the Hair, the Bloody-Flux, Womens monethly Disease, Falling-sickness, and giddiness in the Head, as <HI>Dioscorides, Theophrastus, Pliny,</HI> and <HI>Galen</HI> have it.</P>
<P>But <HI>Fecula,</HI> say the <HI>Japanners,</HI> finding her self with Child by eating that Fruit, saw with sorrowful Eyes her two Companions, <HI>Angela</HI> and <HI>Changela,</HI> ascend again to Heaven, whereas she was forc'd to stay till she was Deliver'd: after nine Moneths she had a Son, who when he was wean'd she laid on a small Isle, commanding him to watch for a Fisher-man, who would bring him up, whilst she ascended to Heaven; from whence she sometime since descended with <HI>Angela</HI> and <HI>Changela.</HI> No sooner had she spoke these words, and took her Journey towards Heaven, but a Fisher-man found the Youth, and carry'd him to his House; where he grew up in such a manner, that at last he Govern'd all the Countrey far and near, and gave Laws to several Kingdoms. After this accident <HI>Fecula</HI> receiv'd the Name of <HI>Pussa,</HI> which the <HI>Japanners</HI> worship in the following manner:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Worshipping of <HI>Pussa,</HI> after what manner.</NOTE>On the shore of a River stand thick Posts, made of the conjoyn'd Bodies of the <HI>Lotus</HI> Tree; on the sides whereof appear black branches, not unlike Ele∣phants Teeth; the Posts are adorn'd with great Gilded Flowers. On the left-side
<PB N="408" REF="250"/>lies a flat Shell, on two thick Branches, in which Shell <HI>Pussa</HI>'s Son kneel∣ing, represents the Posture of Praying. On the top of the Branches lies sloap∣ing a Cushion, on one end whereof stands a Flower-pot, on the other a crook∣ed Branch juts out: In the middle sits <HI>Pussa,</HI> but is onely seen from the Waste upward; her Face representing that of a most beautiful Woman, surrounded with darting Sun-beams: Under a Cloth that hangs before her Breast appear sixteen Arms, whereby they express, That <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan</HI> have been happily govern'd sixteen Ages by this their Goddess <HI>Pussa.</HI> Their Worship to this Dei∣ty is thus perform'd: Two <HI>Japanners</HI> stand up to the middle in Water, just be∣fore the conjoyn'd Bodies of the Trees on which <HI>Pussa</HI> sits; whilst a Boat made fast a little from the Shore, hath a Ram-Goat hanging over her Prow; to Sa∣crifice which, a <HI>Bonzi</HI> stands ready in the middle of the Boat, before a Table, attended by two Servants, with a Hanger in his Hand.</P>

<P>¶ IT was at this time, the second of <HI>March, Anno</HI> 1657, when on a sudden all <HI>Jedo</HI> was in confus'd hurry, every one crying <HI>Fire:</HI> And soon after they saw from <HI>Sicungodonne</HI>'s Palace, toward the North end of the City, a ter∣rible Flame rising towards the Sky, which by strong North Winds was driven directly into the City, the Sparks flying over <HI>Jedo:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sicungodonne</HI> goes cut to give order about the Fire.</NOTE> At which <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> ex∣cus'd himself, that he could no longer enjoy the Ambassadors Presence, it being his Office in such a Calamity to order all things requisite to restrain its inlarging: Yet he sent his three Secretaries to entertain <HI>Wagenaer</HI> in his ab∣sence; but he desir'd leave to depart, that he might see how his Affairs stood in the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Inn, which was granted him; and mounting his Horse, he posted home; for the Fire, though it was near a League from him, yet he saw it come on like a Sea, which impetuously breaking in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Calamity in <HI>Jedo.</HI></NOTE> overflows both Fields and Banks: Wherefore he gave warning to all those where he pass'd by.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wagenaers</HI> Transactions in his Inn.</NOTE>But coming at last to his Inn, he found the Merchant Assistant <HI>Cornelius Mulock,</HI> and the <HI>Japan</HI> Servants, busie packing up the Papers in Chests that lay on the Table, and also the remaining Presents, their Plate, Clothes, and Let∣ters, to secure them in the Scone Store-houses built against Fire, by the <HI>Japan∣ners</HI> call'd <HI>Goddon.</HI> Every one rested, when they heard that the Wind was turn'd, and that there was no danger of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Inn, so that the <HI>Japan</HI> Ser∣vants forbore carrying away the Goods: But between four and five a clock, the Street in which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Inn stood swarm'd with People, and little Wains, in which they carried their young Children and aged People: Where∣upon <HI>Wagenaer</HI> himself got on the top of the House, and saw plainly, that the Fire, as far as he could discern, was spread more and more, and was also dri∣ven towards them by a strong North Wind: He ask'd therefore their Land∣lord <HI>Ginnemon,</HI> Whether he thought it best to carry the Goods of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company and secure them in the <HI>Goddon,</HI> or else to <HI>Joffiesamma. Ginnemon</HI> judg'd the <HI>Goddon</HI> to be sufficient, having not long since endur'd a great Fire: And here already a great part of the Goods lay; but the <HI>Bonjoises</HI> judg'd it fit to carry the Cabinet with the <HI>East-India</HI> Companies Money, to <HI>Joffiesamma</HI> Governor of <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> and that which was in the <HI>Goddon</HI> should remain there, because the Doors and Windows were already plaister'd up with Clay, and all things that were too near the <HI>Goddon</HI> pull'd down: Yet <HI>Wagenaer</HI> would rather have carried them out of the <HI>Goddon;</HI> but whilst he disputed with <HI>Gin∣nemon,</HI> the Flame laid hold on the <HI>Verver</HI> Street, which was but a Musquet∣shot from the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Inn; it was therefore time to fly for safety. <HI>Ginne∣mon</HI> sending his Mother, Wife, and Children before, who amongst a great Crowd of People got out of the Street. The Ambassador <HI>Wagenaer, Ginne∣mon,</HI> and the rest belonging to the Ambassador, also forsook their Inn, which since the last Fire was not quite finish'd; and getting out of Doors, they found themselves in great danger; for the Streets being full every where with Wains,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wagenaer</HI> and his Reti∣nue are in great danger to be burnt.</NOTE> Chests, Trunks, Houshold-goods, and People thronging between them, that they were not able to pass either one way or other. Here they lay heap'd, being tumbled one upon the other; there they were squeez'd betwixt the
<PB N="410" REF="253"/>Goods; yonder with a hideous Cry they throng'd their way through; some being trodden to death, some their Breath squeez'd out of their Bodies, and others crawling over all.</P>
<P>Mean while the Fire approach'd, the Sparks and Smoak whereof was rea∣dy to choak them: Nay, the Smoke so darkned the City, that the Afternoon seem'd rather to be midnight; onely now and then the Sun pierc'd through the thick ascending Cloud, and the Night seem'd to come on six Hours too soon. None could have known whether to have fled, had not the Flame lighted them: And the horrible Cry of those that were in danger, calling to others that were somewhat safer, to fly further, enough to deafen the Hearing,</P>
<P><HI>Wagenaer</HI> and his Retinue found themselves straitned on all sides: Before them the Street was fill'd with Goods and Men, that lay heap'd one upon ano∣ther: On one side the Flame had pass'd them; on the other, it went some∣what farther from them; behind the Fire pursu'd them very closely, whilst they stood in a thick Smoke, full of innumerable Sparks, which were driven by the North Wind like Flakes of Snow: The Fronts of Houses sometimes tumbling forwards into the Street, so covering in a glowing Grave both Men and Goods, which by reason of the Throng could not get away. Sometimes falling sidelong or inwards, they seem'd to cover the Flame, so as at present to keep it from seeking any farther Food: Here crack'd the Wainscots and Partitions, which suddenly taking Fire, hastned the ruine of the Floors and Walls. The Roofs cover'd with little Wooden Shingles, generally took Fire first; unless sometimes one House burning set fire of another, either about the middle, or the bottom. There the Timber and whole Stories tumbled down; yonder great Splinters of burning Wood flew into the Streets; in another place the Roofs fell through into their Cellars; elsewhere the Ground was shaken by falling Towers. These kind of Falls, and several Blows, would have been more distinctly heard, had not the miserable Cry of Young and Old, or those that lay scorching in the Flames, or fear'd being burnt, dead∣ned the sound thereof.</P>
<P>It may easily be guess'd in what an exigence of danger the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassa∣dor was with his Retinue; which they perceiving, at last strove to save them∣selves, by helping one another over the Heaps of Goods and Lumber: So stepping over Men, Chests, and all things that lay in their way, to get farther and farther out of the Press; and breaking through Fences, Pales, and Walls: In which Work had not the <HI>Bonjoisen</HI> and the Interpreters been great Assistants to them, none of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had escap'd with Life from the Fire.</P>
<P>At last getting into an open place, not without extraordinary danger, they went to seek for shelter against the cold Night. They judg'd it convenient to go to <HI>Joffiesamma</HI> his Palace; but the Way thither being exceedingly crowded, the Ambassador <HI>Wagenaer</HI> went to the Lord of <HI>Firando</HI>'s House, being not far di∣stant from them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wagenaer</HI> can sind no Lodging.</NOTE> Their Request of Lodging there was modestly denied, notwithstanding the said Lord was indebted a considerable Sum to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, which had not yet been demanded of him. After this, <HI>Wa∣genaer</HI> went to four places more, but could not be admitted: So that walk∣ing most part of the Night to and again in <HI>Jedo,</HI> he got at last Westward out of the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts out of <HI>Jedo</HI> into a Hut.</NOTE> near the River, where he knock'd at the Hut of a poor Rustick, who gave him leave to come in; but found neither Fire nor Candle. Mean while it froze exceeding hard; and soon after several that were fled from the Fire came also thither, and inform'd <HI>Wagenaer,</HI> that half an Hour after his depar∣ture, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Inn was laid in Ashes.</P>
<PB N="411" REF="253"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The next day views the Fire.</NOTE>At day-break <HI>Wagenaer</HI> went again into the City, where he found all the South part of <HI>Jedo</HI> lying in Ashes, and the Fire raging with more fierceness than the day before; the Flame about Noon taking hold of the Emperors Castle: Here the great Gates were burnt from the Hinges; Half the Watch-houses tumbling into the Moats, were there quench'd, and the remaining part thereof became Fewel for the Fire. About the Evening the Imperial Palace also began to kindle: The Flame never appear'd more terrible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Palace is burnt.</NOTE> than when it blazed out of the high Turrets; for it seem'd to threaten the Sky. This Spoil went on so ragingly, that the Emperor and his Council had scarce time to secure themselves in the Play-houses built on the North side of the Castle.</P>
<P>In two days time the Imperial City lay all in Ashes, above a hundred thousand Houses being burnt to the Ground.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wagenaer</HI> searches for his melted Silver.</NOTE>The fourth of <HI>March, Wagenaer</HI> requested of the chief <HI>Bonjois,</HI> that he would be pleas'd to order some of the Soldiers that attended the Embassy, to search if they could find any Silver under the burnt <HI>Goddon.</HI> The <HI>Bonjois</HI> approving of it, provided him Men, with which <HI>Wagenaer</HI> and <HI>Verschuren</HI> went to the place where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Inn stood. Approaching the City, of which nothing remain'd but the Eastern and Western Suburbs, he saw, with admira∣tion, as far as possible he could discern, a great Plain, smoaking in several Pla∣ces, where two days before had stood a little World of Houses; the Ground heap'd with whole and half-burnt Timber, and abundance of Ashes, accord∣ing as the Building had been greater or lesser: All the Ways, far and near, miserable to behold, which but a little before were adorn'd with Habitations for above a Million of Souls, stately Palaces, fair Towers, sumptuous Tem∣ples, and the Imperial Castle, no ways inferior to all <HI>Amsterdam:</HI> Now nought but a bare Wall surrounded the Plain, whereon <HI>Jedo</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Japan</HI> stood but eight and forty Hours before.</P>
<P>The Ambassador could scarce go ten Paces, but he saw several strange de∣form'd Bodies, of which some had been squeez'd flat under the Timber of Houses, some stifled in the Smoke, and others had their Limbs burnt off; and not a few were so strangely handled by the Flames, that it was impossible to know them by what Limbs they had left. In some places they lay three or four one upon another, being either crowded to death, smother'd, scorch'd, or burnt. In the Street along which they pass'd to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Inn, the Ambas∣sador <HI>Wagenaer</HI> told above three thousand dead Corps.</P>
<P>At one of the outmost Points of <HI>Jedo,</HI> lies a corner of the City, that is se∣parated from the other by strong Walls and great Gates: Thither a great number fled, thinking they should there be safe; wherefore those within lock'd the Gates: But it was not long before the Flame took hold of those Houses that stood along the Walls, so that in that small place above eight hundred were destroy'd, besides the Emperors Prisoners that were carried thi∣ther. The <HI>Japanners</HI> reckon'd the number of those that died by that Calamity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Above a hundred thou∣sand People burnt.</NOTE> to be above a hundred thousand.</P>
<P><HI>Wagenaer,</HI> accompanied with twenty <HI>Bonjoises, Verschuren,</HI> and <HI>Ginnemon,</HI> whose House within three Years had been twice burnt, came to the ruin'd <HI>Goddon,</HI> that there they might if possible dig up some of their Plate; but so soon as the Ashes were stirr'd, it made such a Smoke and Heat, that they could not proceed any farther: Wherefore they return'd with no success; yet they left a Watch there.</P>
<P><HI>Wagenaer</HI> lost in the said <HI>Goddon</HI> six thousand six hundred forty three <HI>Guilders,</HI>
<PB N="412" REF="254"/>in ready Money, which was lock'd in a Cabinet, besides a great deal of Plate for his Table,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wagenaer sav'd some Goods.</NOTE> and that which remain'd of the Presents; yet most of the Trea∣sure was sav'd; for <HI>Wagenaer,</HI> upon the advice of the <HI>Bonjoises,</HI> trusted not the same in the Store-house; but putting most of the ready Money into a Trunk, sent it to <HI>Joffiesamma,</HI> though not without danger: <HI>Wagenaer</HI>'s People having much ado to get through the Crowd, and afterwards sought all Night through the City for their Lord, being troubled for him, and their rich Burthen.</P>
<P>Mean while not one of all the Ambassadors Retinue came to any mischief, but onely his <HI>Japan</HI> Cook <HI>Siobe,</HI> which sometimes serv'd him for his Interpreter, who being hemm'd in by a broken Wall, Was there smother'd to death, and when found, was decently buried.</P>

<P>His Landlord <HI>Ginnemon</HI> was very earnest, though he had been presented with a Piece of black Stammel and Cloth-Serge, which he preserv'd from the Fire, that he might keep the melted Silver, Copper, and Lead that should be digg'd out of the ruin'd <HI>Goddon:</HI> The <HI>Bonjoises,</HI> Interpreters, and <HI>Joffiesamma,</HI> were not backward in interceding for him; wherefore <HI>Wagenaer</HI> was necessitated, though he had great need thereof himself, to give the digg'd up Metal to <HI>Ginnemon.</HI></P>
<P>¶ BEfore <HI>Wagenaer</HI> went from <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> his Interpreter <HI>Fatsiseymon</HI> un∣dertook to desire of <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> to grant longer time for the Ships that Sail'd from <HI>Nangesaque</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> that they might not be hastned so upon their going away, which was to their great damage; or at least, that their Hatches might be lest unseal'd. <HI>Gunemon, Sicungodonne's</HI> Interpreter, took also upon him to entreat the same of his Lord but he going to secure his Mother from the Fire, was burnt with her. Moreover, <HI>Fatsiseymon</HI> durst not venture to speak about the prolonging of time, because of this great Calamity that had lately hapned.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Nobility go away without paying <HI>Wagenaer</HI></NOTE>In the interim, all things were lost; for those Persons of Quality that had the Goods that remain'd or <HI>Wagenaer</HI>'s Presents, were spread up and down in the Countrey, none having paid him a Penny, but <HI>Ando Ockiosamma,</HI> and <HI>Mito∣samma;</HI> and he could not see any way to find his Creditors, whilst he was in danger of his Life amongst a company of hungry People: Wherefore he humbly besought <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> that he might have leave to depart. The Em∣peror granted this his Request; yet told him by his Council, It was conve∣nienter to stay somewhat longer, at least ten days, because the Ways were very dangerous, the People that were burnt out ranging all over the Countrey, and making Prey of whatever they found; and also because the Emperor would furnish him with Rice and other Provisions for fifty Men. The next day <HI>Wa∣genaer</HI> receiv'd, by Order of his Majesty, six Bags of Rice, which the <HI>Bonjoises</HI> took as a Heavenly Gift, and for so great an Honor, as the Emperors had ne∣ver shewn to any Ambassador in the World: So that they concluded, That the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> above all other Nations, were in great favor at Court.</P>
<P>But <HI>Wagenaer</HI> was left solely at his own choice, either to go, or stay; and whilst he was doubtful of both, he at last resolv'd to be gone to <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> because <HI>Joffiesamma,</HI> which had shewn him very great Favors, urg'd him to be gone, saying, <Q>The ways were not so dangerous as it was reported: And what need you fear, since the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador goes not without <HI>Bonjoises,</HI> which Guard conducts you in the Emperors Name; therefore what Man dares do do you harm, being under their Protection? <HI>Joffiesamma</HI> added moreover, The Return (said he) for your Presents, and Payment for the Goods sold, I will keep for you, when they are paid, and deliver you them at <HI>Nangesaque.</HI></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wagenaer</HI> travels out of <HI>Jedo.</HI></NOTE>Upon this Promise and Advice, <HI>Wagenaer</HI> set forward on his Journey the ninth of <HI>March,</HI> and found great trouble to get out of <HI>Jedo;</HI> for the Bridges were every where burnt, onely in some places part of an Arch appear'd above the Water; yet he could scarce get over any where; therefore they judg'd it convenient to find a Way through the Emperors Castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Through the burnt Castle.</NOTE> where the Ambassador saw all thing ruin'd, the Stones in great Flakes flown asunder, the high Tow∣ers levell'd with the Ground, the Sentinel-houses in Ashes; but the Marble Bridge over the first Moat was not so spoil'd, but that they might go over it. Little less than an Hour was <HI>Wagenaer</HI> riding through the Castle, before he could get out on the other side; but having gotten thus far, he rode round about the East side of <HI>Jedo,</HI> and at last came into the right Road.</P>
<P>The Journey prov'd better than the Councellors foretold; for he got on the seven and twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> without any hinderance, to <HI>Meaco,</HI> where he was presented by the great Judge, <HI>Makino Sandosamma,</HI> with five <HI>Japan</HI> Coats of Silk, and ten Boats of Silver.

<P>¶ BUt not long after there arose no small Inconveniences, occasion'd by three Reasons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Hollanders</HI> are at va∣riance with the <HI>Japanners</HI> about the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and a Fly-boat.</NOTE> First, The <HI>Japanners</HI> that liv'd in <HI>Nangesaque</HI> took a great dislike against the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> on this occasion. <HI>Frederick Coyet,</HI> Governor in <HI>Formosa,</HI> sent a Ship call'd the <HI>Red Fox,</HI> under the Command of a Merchant nam'd <HI>Daniel Six,</HI> to <HI>Tamsuy</HI> and <HI>Quelang,</HI> for Coals and Buff-Skins; which Ship sailing again from <HI>Quelang</HI> to <HI>Tayovan,</HI> was by a Westerly Wind and strong Current drove to the Northward, so that they could neither reach <HI>Quelang</HI> nor <HI>Tayovan,</HI> but were a
<PB N="414" REF="255"/>long time toss'd up and down in the Bay of <HI>Arima;</HI> till at last their Provisi∣ons beginning to grow very scant, the Captain was forc'd to make a Vertue of Necessity, and ply it up to <HI>Nangesaque.</HI> The arrival of this Ship out of the Season, occasion'd strange Thoughts in <HI>Quienmonsamma</HI> Governor of <HI>Nange∣saque,</HI> who was not satisfi'd with his making strict inquiry after Six his Voy∣age, though he was to answer and give an account, When he set Sail from <HI>Tay∣ovan?</HI> When he arriv'd at <HI>Tamsuy</HI> and <HI>Quelang?</HI> What Trade he drove in those Places? How far distant <HI>Tamsuy</HI> and <HI>Quelang</HI> lay asunder? At what time, and from whom the <HI>Hollanders</HI> took <HI>Quelang?</HI> With how many Soldiers the Garri∣son was Mann'd? What Profit the Adjacent Countrey brought? What Peo∣ple inhabited it, White or Sallow, Valiant or Cowardly? These Questions ask'd by <HI>Quienmonsamma,</HI> and answer'd by <HI>Six,</HI> were written down, and sent to <HI>Jedo:</HI> After which, no farther Inquiry was made about it; but <HI>Six</HI> had free liberty as others, to sell his Coals and Buff-Skins.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Second Reason of the <HI>Japanners</HI> dislike.</NOTE>To this first, hapned a second Occasion, thus: A <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonk sailing from <HI>Cambodia</HI> to <HI>Japan,</HI> met near <HI>Tayovan</HI> with the Ketch <HI>Domburg</HI> from <HI>Batavia,</HI> who took several Pounds of Wax out of the Jonk, which the Men belonging to it reported at <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> to the great disgrace of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that it was done by force, and that they were Pyrats: So that it little avail'd what the <HI>Holland∣ers</HI> said for their Defence, That <HI>Hans Parys</HI> and <HI>Poynts,</HI> the Commander and Merchant of the Ship <HI>Domburg,</HI> were secur'd in Prison by <HI>Peter Coyet,</HI> to suffer condign Punishment, after Examination of the Crime.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The third.</NOTE>The third Reason, being the chiefest, was occasion'd thus: The Pink <HI>Breu∣kelen</HI> took not long after a <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonk betwixt the Islands <HI>Aur</HI> and <HI>Candor,</HI> and put in the Ship <HI>Urk</HI> eleven <HI>Chinese</HI> Prisoners, three Pieces of Scarlet Cloth, eight Hangers, sixteen Barrels of Tin, and, besides some Trifles, four small Brass Guns. <HI>Urk</HI> being by a strong Current driven past <HI>Tayo,</HI> fell upon the <HI>Japan</HI> Coast before <HI>Satsuma,</HI> there Cruising to and again, till at last the Lord of that place sent a small <HI>Japan</HI> Vessel with a Pennon, call'd <HI>Faisena,</HI> which conducted the Ship <HI>Urk</HI> to <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> where dropping Anchor, the Governor caus'd the <HI>Chinese</HI> Prisoners,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> deal strangely with the Ship <HI>Ʋrk.</HI></NOTE> and also seven and twenty, as well Commanders as Sea∣men, to be fetch'd from aboard, and brought ashore, which he deliver'd into <HI>Wagenaer</HI>'s Hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The common <HI>Japanners</HI> are against the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></NOTE> he being bound for them all. Mean while, the Common People mutinying, threw Stones against the Doors and Windows of the House in which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were, crying, <HI>There lies the</HI> Hollanders <HI>thieving Ship, which comes vaporing here with her stoln Goods: The same Design had the</HI> Red Fox; <HI>but because it did not take, she under a pretence brought Coals hither to sell.</HI> Moreover, they told what a cruel Death those Pyrats deserv'd. But the Go∣vernor quieting them, sent the Interpreters to and again with Questions writ∣ten down to the twenty seven <HI>Hollanders,</HI> whose Answers on every Particular being also set down, were sent to <HI>Jedo.</HI></P>
<P>Then the <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods which they had taken were also fetch'd from aboard, at which the People in <HI>Nangesaque</HI> cried, <HI>Fie,</HI> Dutch <HI>Pyrats: What Death is cruel enough for such Offendor?</HI> And though the <HI>Chineses</HI> gave <HI>Wagenaer</HI> a Receipt, that they had receiv'd satisfaction for all the Goods which <HI>Urk</HI> had taken out of <HI>Breukelen,</HI> yet they came again some days after, and complain'd that they wanted more Goods: Against which, it avail'd not that <HI>Wagenaer</HI> shew'd them their Receipt: Wherefore the Magistrates of <HI>Nangesaque</HI> gave order, That the Ship <HI>Urk</HI> should be search'd a second time, for the Goods which the <HI>Chineses</HI> requir'd.</P>
<PB N="415" REF="255"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chineses</HI> fetch their <HI>Goods</HI> out of the Ship <HI>Ʋik</HI></NOTE>The eighteenth of <HI>October</HI> they went to work: The <HI>Chinese</HI> Interpreter <HI>Ki∣oube,</HI> and also the <HI>Netherland</HI> Interpreters, going aboard the Ship <HI>Urk,</HI> caus'd Packs and Chests to be open'd, in the presence of the Merchant <HI>Meindert Janson Mestecker.</HI> They search'd all things very narrowly, till at last they found in the Sea-mens Chests six and twenty little Bales of Cotton, two Bales of Tee, two fine Mats, a Copper Bason, four <HI>Chinese</HI> Coats; two pair of Breeches, as many Stockins, a Girdle, a Silk Cushion, a Hair Net for the Head, and a red Silk Sute. The Searchers, as Trophies of their Victory, went ashore with the foremention'd Goods, where thousands of <HI>Japanners</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> waited for their return; they holding them aloft, carried them amongst a great Crowd of People to the Governors, who a considerable time look'd upon them, and at last gave them again to the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wagenaer</HI>'s Excuse is not taken.</NOTE><HI>Wagenaer</HI> endeavor'd in vain to excuse the Deed, by telling them of the in∣nocency of the <HI>Indian</HI> Consul at <HI>Batavia,</HI> who severely punish'd Pyracy: But the Magistrates took not this his Testimony, thinking, that if it had hapned only once, it might have been excus'd; but since so many Complaints of the robb'd Jonks were brought in daily, it could not be otherwise, but that the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships had order at <HI>Batavia</HI> for the performing such Pyracy; or at least, the <HI>Indian</HI> Consul wink'd at it.</P>
<P>But <HI>Wagenaer</HI> afterwards bringing this News to <HI>Batavia,</HI> the Consul look'd upon it to be nothing else but the insufferable peevish disposition of the <HI>Japan∣ners,</HI> which appear'd sufficiently,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> set the <HI>Chine∣ses</HI> against the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></NOTE> because <HI>Saujoe</HI> the Owner of the Jonk made not so much ado as they, which were no ways concern'd with it; and the more, because the Jonk was not coming to <HI>Japan,</HI> but going to <HI>China.</HI> And since the <HI>Chineses</HI> found such Interceders of the <HI>Japanners,</HI> they thought themselves incou∣rag'd by them to bring all manner of false Complaints against the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wagenaers</HI> Proposal con∣cerning the <HI>Japanners</HI> seve∣rity.</NOTE><HI>Wagenaer</HI> also propos'd to them, That by a Letter he would inform the Ma∣gistrates of <HI>Japan,</HI> that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would rather part from them in Friend∣ship, and remove their Staple from thence, than endure the Complaints of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who every time they came, had Audience granted them for the false Reports and Tales they told of them. Or else, to prevent farther trou∣ble, it would be convenient to give strict order to all Ships, That they should let all Jonks, either <HI>Coxenga's</HI> or <HI>Tartarians,</HI> pass in quietness.</P>
<P>Mean while, some experienc'd in State-Affairs judg'd, that if the <HI>Japanners</HI> ob∣serv'd, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were in earnest to remove from thence, they would then be better natur'd; for they would not only miss the <HI>Netherland</HI> Presents, and their great Trade; but also that of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> whose Traffick would be spoil'd by the Pyrats that should be sent from <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Batavia:</HI> And <HI>Japan</HI> also might fear, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> joyning with the <HI>English, Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> would do no small mischief to that Empire.</P>
<P>¶ WHilst this Controversie was at the highest, between the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and the <HI>Chineses,</HI> the second Governor of <HI>Nangesaque, Joffiesamma,</HI> came home from <HI>Jedo,</HI> the twenty second of September, and brought no more than thirty Imperial Coats, and sixty Boats of Silver, from three of the Council, which indeed was but a small Return for the <HI>Netherland</HI> Presents. Moreover, there was not one Penny receiv'd of all the Debts due from the Nobles at <HI>Jedo,</HI> nor any News from <HI>Sicungodonne.</HI></P>
<PB N="416" REF="256"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable Discourse betwixt <HI>Kiemonsamma</HI> and <HI>Wagenaer.</HI></NOTE>¶ AFter that, there hapned a remarkable Treaty between <HI>Kiemonsamma</HI> and <HI>Wagenaer,</HI> which proceeded from this occasion: A <HI>Japanner</HI> call'd <HI>Bozy∣mon</HI> had written from <HI>Batavia,</HI> That many died daily there of Hunger, wanting Provisions, because those of <HI>Bantam,</HI> being at Wars with the <HI>Holland∣ers,</HI> prevent any Relief from coming to them; and also, That the Condition of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company in <HI>Canton</HI> was but very mean. This Letter was given to <HI>Kiemonsamma;</HI> who thereupon sent for <HI>Wagenaer</HI> to come to him, that from his mouth he might receive better Information concerning that business, asking him, From what occasion the War arose between <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Batavia?</HI> What hopes they had of Peace? What space of Ground was between the two fore∣mention'd Places? <HI>Wagenaer</HI> replied, That as for the Famine, War with <HI>Bata∣via,</HI> nor the Affairs of <HI>Canton,</HI> he had not the least Advice; which not being mention'd in his Letters from <HI>Batavia,</HI> he look'd upon it to be onely a rais'd Report. Moreover, <HI>Bantam</HI> lay about nine Leagues from <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kiemonsamma</HI> ask'd again; Why do there come so many Frigats of War to <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> whereas heretofore none but Flyboats came to an Anchor there? The Emperors Order was to take the Rudder from all <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, so soon as they came before <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> which could not be done to the great Ships, without cutting a hole in the Cabbin; to prevent which inconvenience, he had permitted that they should keep them on; but hereafter they would do so no more, but follow his Order.</P>
<P><HI>Wagenaer</HI> replied, That most of their Flyboats were gone, so that they were forc'd to take what Ships they could get.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Netherland</HI> Interpreters.</NOTE>¶ SHortly after this, the Magistrates of <HI>Nangesaque</HI> made some alteration amongst their Interpreters on <HI>Disma;</HI> for dismissing the old <HI>Kitsobe</HI> of his Imployment, they gave the Place to his Son <HI>Sinkits,</HI> who spake good <HI>Portu∣guese,</HI> for Chief Interpreter; to whom they gave for an Assistant one <HI>Firandees Josseyemon,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Brasman,</HI> reasonably well experienc'd in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Tongue. These to be paid by the <HI>Ottena,</HI> that is, <HI>Overseer of the East-India Companies Store-house,</HI> who besides fed with no meaner Diet than Quails the Interpreters <HI>Mangale, Scheseymon, Fatsimon, Sitsibe Nisfyoye,</HI> and <HI>Josseyemon,</HI> with out whom no Business can be done, for their Voyces must be in it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emperor sends for two Globes.</NOTE>¶ MEan while, News came from <HI>Jedo,</HI> That <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> demanded for the Emperor a Globe and Sphere, the former being burnt in the late Fire, with all the other Presents. He thought also to get great esteem with the Engine; wherefore he commanded strictly, that none should see it, but that it should be sent with all speed to <HI>Jedo:</HI> But the Magistrates of <HI>Nangesaque</HI> little regarding <HI>Sicungodonne</HI>'s Commands, shew'd it daily to Persons of Quality, who, to try it, play'd Water out of the same.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emperors Sentence concerning the Ship <HI>Ʋrk.</HI></NOTE>With this Advice, came other Orders from the Emperor, concerning the Ship <HI>Urk,</HI> out of which the <HI>Chineses</HI> took their Goods. The Orders being these, were read to <HI>Wagenaer</HI> and <HI>Bouchelyon</HI> in <HI>Joffiesamma</HI>'s Hall: <Q>The Frigot <HI>Urk</HI> shall with the other Ships go for <HI>Batavia;</HI> the eleven <HI>Chinese</HI> Prisoners in a Jonk to <HI>China:</HI> The Goods and Jonk taken by the Ship <HI>Breukelen</HI> must be re∣stor'd to the Owner. If the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at any time hereafter plunder any more Jonks that are coming to <HI>Japan,</HI> they shall for ever be banish'd from the Empire. Moreover, <HI>Wagenaer,</HI> whom <HI>Bouchelyon</HI> was to succeed in his
<PB N="417" REF="256"/>place, and was ready to go for <HI>Batavia,</HI> should make the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor's Edicts, read to them, known to <HI>Coyet</HI> Governor of <HI>Fermosa.</HI></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Request of <HI>Todo.</HI></NOTE>¶ BUt a little before <HI>Wagenaer</HI>'s departure, <HI>Todotaychosama,</HI> a mighty Lord of that Countrey came and proffer'd a great Sum of Money for an Ostritch, which was brought thither from <HI>Batavia</HI> with the last Ships; but the Magi∣strates of <HI>Nangesaque</HI> forbad the selling of it, judging it convenient to send this strange Bird to the Emperor for a Present, which indeed did not please <HI>Bouche∣lyon,</HI> because of the great Expences and Charge which the Carriage of them thi∣ther amounts to. Lastly, <HI>Todo</HI> desir'd by the Interpreters, to have six Turkies, some Singing Birds, two white Harts, as many Apes, and one Pair of the least flying Crocodiles: He received for answer; that care should be taken to en∣quire for them in all places.</P>
<P>¶ THe Interpreter <HI>Scheseymon</HI> brought also Tidings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambergreece.</NOTE>That the Lord of <HI>Sat∣suma</HI> had a Piece of Ambergreece that weigh'd a hundred and thirty Pounds, which he valued at fourteen thousand Tail. Moreover, the <HI>Japanners</HI> also at several times brought small pieces of Ambergreece to sell in their Hand∣kerchiefs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Original.</NOTE>Concerning the Original of this Amber are several Opinions, for some think, that it is either the Spawn or Dung of a Whale; others look upon it to be a Spungy Earth that grows in the Sea under the Rocks, by the beating Waves wash'd off in Pieces, which by reason of their lightness, Swim above the Water. But those that seem to come nearest the truth, as the Learned <HI>Ber∣nard Paludanus</HI> judgeth, approving of <HI>Linschot</HI>'s Opinion, hold Amber to be a sort of Pitch, arising up from the Ground, and hardned by the Sun, and is found not unlike Brimstone or Coral: But its Original from a Whale hath not the least appearance of truth; for if Amber should proceed from the Spawn or Dung of a Whale, it would needs be found most in those places where the greatest number of Whales frequent: But it is known to the contrary, that <HI>Green-Land, Spitsbergen,</HI> or elsewhere, where these Sea-Monsters abound, never produce any Amber; whereas on the contrary, <HI>Soffala, Mosambique, Melinde,</HI> the <HI>Maldivian</HI> Islands, the Promontory of <HI>Comoryn,</HI> the Province of <HI>Satsuma</HI> in <HI>Ja∣pan,</HI> and other <HI>Indian</HI> Countreys, produce Amber, before whose Coasts seldom or never any Whales are seen to Swim.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is the best Amber.</NOTE>The best Amber is Grey, with White Veins, wherefore it is call'd Amber∣greece; that which is Black yields not the Price of the Grey; the best is known when Try'd, by putting a small Stick into it, upon which it yields much Oyl. The <HI>Indian</HI> Nobility use abundance of Amber in their Meats, to provoke Letchery. <HI>Paludanus</HI> ascribes to Amber, that with its pleasant Smell, it strengthens the Heart and Brain, takes off Watery Humors from the Stomach, cures Falling-Sickness, and Risings of the Lights; and is generally good for all Ancient and Decrepit People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Japanners</HI> make but little Camphire.</NOTE>They were also inform'd on the Island <HI>Disma,</HI> concerning Camphire, that the Workmen of <HI>Satsuma</HI> had given over preparing of it, because of the small profit they reap'd by it, wherefore most of them were gone to dig in the Silver Mines. The <HI>Chinese.</HI> Camphire which is made in <HI>Cincheu,</HI> as also the <HI>Japan</HI> in <HI>Sat∣suma,</HI> differ much from that which <HI>Borneo</HI> produces; for one Pound of <HI>Bornean</HI> would yield sixty times as much more (by one that hath skill in Camphire) as the <HI>Japan</HI> or <HI>Chinese</HI> Camphire grows on Trees, not unlike Nut-Trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How it is made.</NOTE> being
<PB N="418" REF="257"/>a Gum, which Swetting, drops from the main Body of the Tree: The drops are white, and distinguish'd in four sorts; The <HI>Indians</HI> use also several Sieves, so to have every sort by it self; thorow the finest falls the worst, and thorow the greatest and coursest the best; the filthiness and Dross they take from it with hot Water, Sope, and Lemon Juyce, which dry'd in a Pan becomes whiter than before: The <HI>East-India</HI> Company were to exped no more Camphire from <HI>Satsuma,</HI> because there they had given over preparing it fit for use.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The making of Wax.</NOTE>But in making of Wax'd Merchandize the <HI>Japanners</HI> proceeded as formerly, wherein the Art of the Workmen is to be admir'd; but much more the Pis∣mires which make the Wax. The Workmen beat the Wax to Powder, and melt it, then mix with the melted Wax all manner of Colours, according as they think best; and then pour it upon long round Pieces, which Pieces they stick on Wood made hot, about a Nail thick; then Polish it over with Straw or dry Broom: After which manner they make their Chests, Tables, Boxes, and other things, which <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>China</HI> furnish <HI>Europe</HI> with in a plentiful manner.</P>

<P>This Edifice stands about six Musquet Shot from the Palace; between both, a Way is made of Rushes Pleited, and Painted Red, which keeps off the Mul∣titudes which flock to see the Funeral in incredible numbers: Along this Fence stand little Huts, the Roofs of which rest on four Turn'd Pillars, the sides sepa∣rated by Gilded Silk Curtains, within lie Iron Pots, Rice, and yellow Cloth for Priests.</P>
<P>Before the Corps come forth, their Players Act publickly in the Market-place, whilst several heavy Golden Balls, some great and some little, are brought thither: The Street between the Palace and the Funeral Pire is full of Sledges that stand in two Rows, on which appear strange deform'd Creatures, artificial∣ly made of Rushes; some representing the shape of Elephants, Dragons, and Tygers; others, half Men and half Beasts, <HI>Rhinocerots,</HI> every ones Back repre∣senting a Seat like a Throne, on four Square Pedistals curiously Painted, some of which Seats are fill'd with Sandal-Wood to burn the Corps: These Pleited Monsters are made fast with Ropes one to another, by which they are drawn forward through thousands of people.

<P>Every thing represents either Art or Splendor; for the Chariot and the Throne whereon the Corps stands, is cover'd with thick Golden Plates, and adorn'd with Imagery, Inlaid with Mother of Pearl, and green glittering Glass.

<P><Q>I was, says he, with the rest of the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> by the Interpreters call'd to Court, to see the Splendid Funeral of the King's Daughter, Born by his Royal Queen: But because the Messengers came somewhat too late, the Corps was already carry'd to the Funeral Pire; but going thither, we got upon a Scaffold, which by the King's Order was built for us, not far from the Fire. In the middle of the Market-place in <HI>Judia,</HI> in sight of the Royal Palace, stood five Turrets rais'd of high Masts, hung round about with Gil∣ded Mats; four Towers more of the same height and shape, made an exact Quadrangle: In the middle of the four was another Erected much larger and higher; for whereas the four were but twenty Fathom high, the middlemost was thirty, all Plated with Gold, and Emboss'd with Precious Stones, Dazel∣ling the Eyes of the Beholder. Within the biggest Tower stood an exceed∣ing costly Altar, rais'd six Foot from the Ground, on which the Corps of the King's Daughter was to be Burnt, and was now brought thither, after it had been Embalm'd, and stood six Moneths in State in her Fathers Court. The Corps its self was Apparel'd in Majestick Robes, with Gold Chains, Arm-lets, Neck-Laces of Pearl, and other Precious Jems; on her Head she wore a Crown of Gold; the Body sat up-right in a Praying posture, in a Chest of Massie Gold an Inch thick; her Hands folded together, and her Face up to∣wards Heaven. Then the greatest <HI>Mandarines</HI> or <HI>Siam</HI> Lords, with their Ladies stept to the Corps, and every one shewing a very mournful Countenance,
<PB N="423" REF="261"/>were all Clothed in fine white Linnen, without any Gaiety,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Very rematkable Fune∣ral.</NOTE> and Strew'd an Handful of Flowers or Perfumes on the Deceased; after which, the Golden Chest with the Corps was set on a high Throne, Erected on a stately Cha∣riot, and Presented before the chief Peers and Ladies of the Land; where∣upon the Princesses make first a doleful cry, then wringing their Hands, and Shreeking aloud, calling also several times together on the Name of the De∣ceased, shew all the Postures of a hearty sorrow. Mean while, the Cha∣riot which was drawn by the Prime Nobility, began to approach the fore∣said five Towers: Before the Corps, the King's eldest Son, the Deceased's eldest Brother Rode on an Elephant: On both sides his two second Brothers, whose Elephants were Caparison'd in White, every one having a long Scarf in their Hand, whereof one end was made fast to the Coffin, so seeming as if they drew the Body along: On both sides of the Chariot, also walk'd four∣teen of the King's Children on Foot, Clothed in fine White Linen, and a green Bough in their Hand: Just behind the Chariot follow'd all the Princes and their Princesses in great State: On both sides of the Way, through which the Chariot pass'd stood stately Scaffolds, each standing twenty Fathom from the other, on which the meaner sort of <HI>Mandarins,</HI> or Lords sate, who when the Corps came before them, threw several Suits of Clothes amongst the throng of People, and also Oranges stuck full <HI>Ticols</HI> and <HI>Masees,</HI> which is a sort of <HI>Siam</HI> Silver Coyn, the first valu'd at about two Shillings, and the last at six Pence. The concourse of People was so exceeding great, that ma∣ny were throng'd to death: But so soon as the Chariot stopp'd before the middlemost of the five Towers, the Corps was taken down by the primest Lords, and not without great Ceremony (whilst the Musicians Sung and Play'd all manner of doleful Tunes) was placed on the Altar in the fifth Tower, and surrounded with <HI>Sandal</HI> and <HI>Agor</HI>-Wood, sprinkled with the sweetest Perfumes, and best of Essenses.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Princesses that must either cry or be beat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, where that Custom is us'd.</NOTE> <Q>Then the whole Train of the King's Children and prime Lords return'd to Court; but the Princesses stay'd two days and two nights with the Corps: where sitting round about the Altar, they may not during that time stir a foot from thence, but must cry continually without ceasing; to which every one uses her utmost endeavor, thereby to express her exceeding for∣row; for if otherwise they forget this Ceremony, they are immediately, without regard of their Quality, miserably beaten with short thick Cords by Women order'd by the King for that purpose. On one side, at some di∣stance from the five Towers stood a brave Scaffold, cover'd with thick gilded and oyl'd Paper; on which the chief Priests of <HI>Siam</HI> sat Praying for the Deceased; sometimes ceasing, they gave Alms amongst the common People, as abundance of Clothes, Pots, Pans, Beds, and other Houshold∣stuff; and also Carpenters Tools, Axes, Saws, Augers, and the like. But besides this prime Scaffold, there were several less for the ordinary Priests, whose numbers amounted to above a thousand; which were also employ'd either in Praying, or distributing of Alms amongst the People. In a spacious Place round about the five Towers stood twenty more, out of which after Sun-set, for fourteen days together, rare and artificial Fire-works were shown.</Q></P>

<P>The eight and twentieth of <HI>February</HI> he began his scrutiny: three hundred Ladies of Honor, and other great Persons of Quality which had ever been in Company with the King's Daughter whilst she was living, were driven through a huge Fire, that (according to the <HI>Siam</HI> Law) they might be try'd, if they were guilty or not, which they knew by the Flames hurting or preserving them.</P>
<P>This Trial was perform'd not without great Charms and Incantations; yet all of them passing safe through the Fire without receiving the least hurt, were again set at liberty. Mean while there was great suspicion, that the youngest Daughter to the former King (for the present King had in a Rebel∣lion bereav'd his Predecessor both of his Life and Crown) might have committed the Fact; because being this King's Concubine, she had sometime shew'd her self very much dissatisfi'd, because he shew'd such exceeding kind∣ness and great respects to his eldest Daughter, and regarded not hers, who also acknowledg'd him for her Father: and indeed the suspicion grew the greater when the King was inform'd, that this his Concubine was observ'd to laugh, whilst every one present at the Funeral bewail'd the death of the Deceased: For this jealousie the Princess, with a great Train of her Ladies of Honor, was forc'd also to go through the Fire, all of them passing through without be∣ing hurt, except the Princess, who was very much burnt on both her Feet: therefore she was immediately loaden with Silver Fetters, and committed to a Prison where none were suffer'd to speak with her. On the second of <HI>March</HI> she had publick Audience before all the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> or Lords; where, whether out of fear of exquisite tortures, or terrifi'd with the King's anger, she freely said, <HI>If the King will promise upon Oath, that he will immediately Execute me, and keep me no longer alive, to be a scorn and derision to the World, there will need but little trouble to find out the mystery of his Daughters death.</HI> The <HI>Mandarins</HI> which remembred the former Condition and State of this Princess, when her Father was King of <HI>Siam,</HI> were no less amaz'd at her noble courage, than inwardly prick'd with compassion to find out a means for her Deliverance; but the fear they had of the present King quenched all such motions: They reported that which she had said to his Majesty; who immediately promis'd upon Oath, that the
<PB N="425" REF="262"/>Princess after real confession should not live an hour to be despis'd by the World. Upon which she confessed, <Q>That not without help of her Nurse she had prepar'd a Poyson, which was so Charm'd, that one piece of his or her Flesh that took it should not be consum'd by Fire, whene're the so poyson'd should be burnt. This Compound by a mistake the King's Daughter greedily swallow'd, which thus prepar'd was intended for her Father, that the death of so bloody a Tyrant, (who like a Villain treache∣rously took the Scepter out of my Fathers Hand, that was lawful King of <HI>Siam,</HI> and oppress'd the true Royal Family) might satisfie my Revenge for my Fathers Death, and to deliver those of Royal Blood from insupportable slavery.</Q> No sooner was this Relation of hers carry'd to the King, but he caused a great piece of Flesh to be cut out of the Princesses Side, which he forc'd her with great threatnings to eat up; and whilst she was swallowing the last Bit, some of his Executioners, appointed for that purpose, fell upon her with drawn Swords, and left not off till they had chopp'd her into a thou∣sand pieces, which they afterwards threw into the River <HI>Judia.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after the Princesses Brother, Son to the depos'd King of <HI>Siam,</HI> was also Executed, he being in the former Insurrection spar'd alive, because he was suppos'd to be frantick; but at his Death appear'd the contrary, he also subtily contriving with his Sisters to destroy the King, and make himself Master of the Crown; and had not the Business been untimely betray'd, he had no small hopes to repossess his Fathers lost Kingdoms.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wagenaer</HI>'s farther Jour∣ney to <HI>Jedo.</HI></NOTE>¶ <HI>WAgenaer</HI> having Sail'd past <HI>Saccai,</HI> came on the seventeenth of <HI>March</HI> to <HI>Osacca,</HI> where he found Provision exceeding dear and scarce, occasi∣on'd by a great Storm which had spoil'd all the Corn about the Courttrey; so that the Carriage of Goods on Pack-horses, amounted to much more than at other times.</P>
<P><HI>Wagenaer</HI> presented the Governor <HI>Faitosamona</HI> and <HI>Tambesamma,</HI> who furnish'd him with thirty Men to carry the two <HI>Bengael</HI> Oxen and their Carrs.</P>
<P>Whilst <HI>Wagenaer</HI> spent five days in <HI>Osacca,</HI> preparing all things necessary for his Journey by Land, news came from <HI>Meaco,</HI> that forty Streets were burnt down in that City, and not a few of the Inhabitants destroy'd by the Flame.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the City <HI>Jonda.</HI></NOTE>From <HI>Osacca, Wagenaer</HI> took his Journey through <HI>Firaskatta</HI> to <HI>Jonda,</HI> which is a small Town lying in the Territory <HI>Jamaisiro,</HI> at the River which runs through <HI>Osacca,</HI> and lies eight Leagues distant from thence. There is scarce any Place in <HI>Japan,</HI> that for pleasantness surpasseth <HI>Jonda:</HI> for if you look for curious Buildings, here are stately Turrets, large Churches, and very neat Houses: the Windows are clos'd with bright glittering Shutters: their Chambers are big∣ger or less, according to their several Partitions, the Walls painted with all manner of Imagery on gilded Paper, and edg'd above, below, and on all sides, with black wax'd Ledges: the Doors of the standing Partitions are also adorn∣ed like the Walls: at the upper end of the Chamber hangs generally a Picture;
<PB N="426" REF="263"/>before which stands a Flower-pot; which kind of Furniture is us'd in all <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>Jonda</HI> lies an Imperial Castle, surrounded with a Stone Wall, raised out of deep Moat, within it a stately Palace, whose Turret may be seen at a great distance. The Countrey about it is Woody on one side, and abounds with Deer and wild Boars: on the other side appear pleasant Meadows, which produce store of Rice, and all manner of Plants. No Place affords more Swans, Geese, Ducks, Pheasants, Pigeons, Partridges, Woodcocks, Quails, and all manner of Fowls than this. The River yields Breams, Place, and ex∣ceeding good Salmon, all which Fish come up the River out of the Sea: but those that are taken at <HI>Jonda</HI> are much better than those which are taken at <HI>Osacca.</HI> It is to be admir'd, that their Salmon here, though the Heart be cut out, will live several hours afterwards, and that the Heart cut out dies not till a night and a day after. But though this Salmon be acceptable, and of a plea∣sing taste, yet the Head thereof is very unwholsom, for those that eat much of it are subject to get a Fever.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wagenaer</HI> arrives at <HI>Jedo.</HI></NOTE><HI>Wagenaer</HI> got on the one and twentieth of <HI>March</HI> towards the Evening to <HI>Meaco,</HI> and presented there the Grand Judge <HI>Mackino Sandosamma;</HI> from whom he got a free Pass to <HI>Jedo,</HI> where hearriv'd in safety thirteen days after he left <HI>Meaco,</HI> the foul and rainy Weather making the Journey longer than at other times; so that the usual time on which the Emperor us'd to give Audience be∣ing past, the Ambassador was forc'd to stay a considerable time before he could be admitted to the Emperor's Presence. Mean while he understood, that <HI>Si∣cungodonne</HI> had the year before, because of his great age, given over following all publick Employments; and that the Emperor had given his Place to a prime Courtier call'd <HI>Hootye Auwanno, Cammisamma:</HI> Yet nevertheless <HI>Wagenaer</HI> sent an Inventory of all the Presents to <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> that he might order the dividing of them; but the Interpreters went not to <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> but to <HI>Joffie∣samma,</HI> Governor of <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> who Read the Inventory over several times, and approv'd at last of the dividing of them, onely he would have the Ambas∣sador to add two Pieces of black Cloth to the Emperor's Presents; and since <HI>Joffiesamma</HI> would have it so, <HI>Wagenaer</HI> was forc'd to let the two Pieces of black Cloth go. Moreover he judg'd it unhandsom to leave out <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> not∣withstanding he was retir'd from Courtly Employments, considering he had been so great a help to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> on all occasions heretofore. Whereupon <HI>Wagenaer</HI> commanded the Interpreters a second time to give the fore-mention'd Inventory to <HI>Sicungodonne;</HI> but he sent it back without Reading of it, and mo∣destly excus'd himself, that hence-forward he could not serve them in their Bu∣siness; yet he was satisfi'd that they still acknowledg'd him. <HI>Sicungodonne</HI>'s new Successor <HI>Hootye Auwanno</HI> would not concern himself with the <HI>Hollanders</HI> this first time; therefore they were forc'd to Govern themselves according to <HI>Joffie∣samma</HI>'s humors, who was a stern and churlish Person.</P>
<P><HI>Wagenaer</HI> found no small trouble about the securing of his Presents; for the Inn wherein he Lodg'd being nothing else but a Hut cover'd with Straw, ha∣ving not been re-built since the Fire; and indeed all the Houses in <HI>Jedo</HI> were made after such a manner, that it seem'd rather a large Village than a City. The Store-house behind the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Inn lay still buried in Rubbish. But <HI>Joffiesamma</HI> proffer'd <HI>Wagenaer</HI> his <HI>Goddon,</HI> and a Chamber in the Palace to di∣vide the Presents in, when they should be given to the Emperor; and although <HI>Wagenaer</HI> consider'd the removing, yet he durst not deny the Proffer, but Pack∣ing up their Goods sent them thither.</P>

<P>Mean while there came Orders, that the Councellors and <HI>Japan</HI> Princes were to appear before the Emperor on the eight and twentieth of the new Moon, by them call'd <HI>Ninguats;</HI> which time agrees with our ninth and tenth of <HI>April: Joffiesamma</HI> acquainted <HI>Wagenaer</HI> with it two days before, ordering him, that he and his Retinue should be in handsom Apparel, and come to Court on the ap∣pointed day by nine of the Clock in the Morning: The day being come, <HI>Wagenaer</HI> rose very early, and fetching the Presents from <HI>Joffiesamma</HI>'s House, carry'd them to Court, where he set them in publick view.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Appears before the Em∣peror.</NOTE> But that which most troubled him were the <HI>Bengael</HI> Oxen, many hundreds of the <HI>Japanners</HI> ha∣ving waited all the day before to see them; and indeed they made so great a Crowd, that it would have been impossible for him to have gotten through them: to prevent which trouble, the Oxen that stood in the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Inn were cover'd with red Flannel with silk Tassels, Roses, gilded Bells, and all manner of Ribbons. Before day-break they were led to the Court by the In∣terpreters; where <HI>Wagenaer</HI> met them at the appointed time: he stay'd two hours in the Emperor's little Palace, which stands Westward from the greater, in which the Emperor resided since he was burnt out of the biggest two years before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What they did with them before the Emperor.</NOTE>In the interim <HI>Joffiesamma</HI> came into the usual Waiting-Hall, and taking <HI>Wagenaer</HI> by the Hand, led him through a stately Gallery to the Throne, where he found the Emperor standing upright, and looking more earnestly on the Presents, and chiefly on the <HI>Bengael</HI> Oxen, than on <HI>Wagenaer,</HI> who lay with his Face flat on the Ground; but he lay not long before he was commanded to rise, and return to the Hall from whence he came; where staying with his Reti∣nue, a Person of Quality came to them, and ask'd in the name of the Councel, that two <HI>Hollanders</HI> would come into the open Court, that there they might shew to the Councel (amongst which the Emperor was also present) how they might Harness the Oxen, put them into the Care, and drive them, for the Emperor taking great delight in them, would see them Draw every day: and also besides the other Presents, the rich <HI>Alcatiff,</HI> wove of Gold and Silver was very acceptable to him; so that the Emperor spent two hours time in viewing the Presents and the <HI>Bengael</HI> Oxen: after which <HI>Wagenaer</HI> had leave to depart; which word being brought by <HI>Joffiesamma, Wagenaer</HI> thank'd him for his quick dispatch with the Emperor.

<P><HI>Joffiesamma</HI> gave the Ambassador timely notice, that the Emperor had cho∣sen two new Councellors that Year, <HI>Inoube Cattwatsisamma,</HI> and <HI>Itacera Auwanna Cammisamma,</HI> therefore they ought no ways to be forgotten, whereupon they also had Presents given them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Journey to <HI>Je∣do</HI> cost the <HI>Hellanders.</HI></NOTE>This Journey cost very dear, being occasion'd by many inconveniences, for not onely did their Voyages by Water last longer than ordinary, by reason of contrary Winds, but also their Journey by Land, because of the flabby and rainy Weather: Moreover, they were forc'd to stay in <HI>Jedo</HI> thirty days where all manner of Provisions ever since the Fire were very scarce, and sold at an exceeding dear Rate; and were necessitated to Present the new Councellors, which was more than they expected.

<PB N="428" REF="264"/>because it would occasion discontent and envy amongst the <HI>Japan</HI> Nobility, and chiefly if one should be more kindly us'd than the other. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> (said he) should make the Inventory of their Presents at <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> and bring no more to <HI>Jedo</HI> than what they intended to give away. But <HI>Wagenaer</HI> inform'd <HI>Joffie∣samma,</HI> that some years ago the <HI>Hollanders</HI> receiv'd express Orders, that besides the usual Presents, they should bring also some Merchandise to sell, partly to give to new elected Lords, and partly to accommodate other Persons of Qua∣lity asking for them for Money; which Answer satisfying <HI>Joffiesamma,</HI> he per∣mitted that <HI>Wagenaer</HI> should sell the remaining Goods; who made use of this liberty, and sold the Goods for 550 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR></HI> Moreover he judg'd it fit for the future to make the Inventory of the Presents at <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> according to <HI>Joffiesamma</HI>'s advice; and the rather, because that for the time to come they could be no more instructed by <HI>Sicungodonne,</HI> to whom till then the <HI>Hollanders</HI> left the divi∣ding of the Presents.</P>
<P>Mean while this antient Interceder for the <HI>Hollanders</HI> seem'd to have a great respect for them, he being exceedingly pleas'd that they had brought him his desir'd Commodities, as Pitch, the best <HI>Dutch</HI> Sail cloth, and Garden-Seeds, for which he paid according to what they demanded. He requested, that as soon as possible some <HI>European</HI> Medicines might be sent him: which <HI>Wagenaer</HI> promis'd faithfully to perform. And <HI>Sicungodonne</HI> told them, that he would promote all things that might be advantageous to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in their <HI>East-India</HI> Trade: in Which he could do much, he being a great Favorite at Court, and very intimate with the Councellor <HI>Enimosamma,</HI> through whose hands the greatest Concerns of the <HI>Japan</HI> Empire pass'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Nobles are bad Pay-masters.</NOTE>But as for the Money which the <HI>Japan</HI> Nobility were in arrears since the Fire, which was then two years, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had no news of it, notwithstand∣ing a <HI>Japan</HI> Secretary, call'd <HI>Nimon,</HI> employ'd by <HI>Wagenaer</HI> several times de∣manded it, for it availed not: The Debtors being most of them Persons of great Quality, it was dangerous to Dun them; also a Servant scarce durst bring such a Message to his Master, except he be in a very good humor in∣deed. But amongst other Nobles <HI>Oenemidonne</HI> deny'd that he had bought any Goods, neither could the Interpreters be perswaded, or hir'd by <HI>Wagenaer</HI> to demand Payment of him: they pretended to be indispos'd, and not in a ca∣pacity to ask for Debts: Yet <HI>Wagenaer</HI> sent him a Letter to put him in mind; which he receiv'd, and promis'd to pay: but when sent to according to his promise, he deny'd himself, his Servants telling those that came that he was gone up into the Countrey.</P>

<PB N="429" REF="264"/>get into the Emperor's favor, who would requite such a Courtesie, by granting them a free Trade, without any molestation in <HI>Japan.</HI></Q> Moreover, <HI>Auwanno</HI> added hereto, <Q>That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for the future should be very careful, that they Boarded no <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks, that Traded to <HI>Japan,</HI> so by Robbing them to make the Seas dangerous: the Emperor as yet knew no∣thing of the Jonks that not long since had been taken by them; but if they did not give over Pyrating, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would be sure to repent it; for his Imperial Majesty would no ways suffer that the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who were peacea∣ble Neighbors, should be disturb'd in their Trade.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wagenaer</HI>'s Answer.</NOTE><HI>Wagenaer</HI> reply'd, <Q>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> do account themselves highly obliged to the <HI>Japan</HI> Empire, therefore they would do all things that might be ad∣vantageous to <HI>Japan;</HI> and whenever they had the least knowledge, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> should Plot against it, they would certainly make it known at <HI>Nangesaque.</HI> Concerning the <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks which were robb'd, the Fact was done by rude Sea-men, and without the least knowledge of the Councel at <HI>Batavia;</HI> wherefore the Criminals should be severely punish'd for an example to others.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Emperors Presents.</NOTE>This Answer pleasing the Council exceeding well, they caus'd thirty of the Emperors richest Coats to be brought on three long Boards: <HI>Auwanno</HI> said, <Q>Your Presents, O <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador, are most acceptable to the Emperor; wherefore he hath given you these in return, and also gives you free leave to go to <HI>Nangesaque.</HI></Q> Which said, <HI>Wagenaer</HI> was by <HI>Joffiesamma</HI> conducted to the Guard-Hall, where he wish'd him much joy of his quick Dispatch, and the Em∣perors Favor; and also proffer'd to do him all the Service he could, if he re∣quir'd any thing to his Journey.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollanders</HI> Presents are not accepted, and why.</NOTE>Moreover, the Kings of <HI>Ouwarri, Cunocuni,</HI> and <HI>Mito,</HI> the Emperor's Uncle, and also the Councellor <HI>Minosamma,</HI> ask'd for some Strings of Blood-Coral, and six Cast of <HI>Loopen,</HI> the form of which was drawn on a piece of Paper, and given to <HI>Wagenaer. Minosamma</HI> requir'd also a Perspective-Glass, which be∣ing accordingly sent, was return'd again, the same being, as he pretended, too dark; but indeed the fault was in the bad Informations of his Servants, who knew not how to use it. And just so it was with the costly Book of Plants of <HI>Rembert Dodoneus;</HI> for although the Flowers, Trees, and Herbs were extraor∣dinary handsom to the Life, yet <HI>Minosamma</HI> sent it back again, because he look'd upon the Prints to be too small, and not well drawn; so desiring a bigger Book, and one that was handsomer painted. And as little was the Globe esteem'd, which with all the Art imaginable was made for the Emperor of <HI>Ja∣pan</HI> in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> because they knew not the meaning thereof; yet some of them could find the chiefest Kingdoms in <HI>Europe</HI> upon it, and pointing to them with their Fingers, name them: But as for the representation of the Planets, they have many strange thoughts; for most of them think, that certainly such Men and Beasts do invisibly stick to the Clouds; others, that they inhabit the Heavens.</P>

<P>The Interpreter and <HI>Bonjoises</HI> forbad their Pilot to sail into the <HI>Straights</HI> be∣tween
<PB N="430" REF="265"/><HI>Bungo</HI> and the Main Coast of <HI>Japan,</HI> towards the <HI>Corean</HI> Sea, layings That the time of the Trade-Wind was gone, therefore they should lye longer on the Sea; and that they could not possibly get forward, the Winds blowing continually against them: The <HI>Hollanders</HI> might, according to the Advice of the Council, travel over-land to <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> and so chuse a certainty for an uncertainty; and they were sure to be safer on Shore, than at Sea.</P>
<P>Yet <HI>Wagenaer</HI> was doubtful, because new Inventions bring new Inconveni∣encies and Charge; wherefore he thought it best to go the usual way by Wa∣ter, and not through <HI>Bungo,</HI> which would increase their Charge, that was great enough otherwise: Yet it avail'd not that <HI>Wagenaer</HI> seem'd to dislike the Proposal of the <HI>Bonjoises</HI> and Interpreters; but they went against his will their own way, Ferrying over from <HI>Simonisicci</HI> to the City <HI>Cokero,</HI> lying on <HI>Bungo,</HI> in an Inlet opposite to <HI>Simonisicci;</HI> and landing at <HI>Cokero,</HI> whether <HI>Wagenaer</HI> would or not, he was forc'd to follow them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His dangerous Journey though <HI>Bungo.</HI></NOTE>The Journey was dangerous, because of the Rivers which run between the Rocks, through which they were forc'd to wade: The steep Banks and doubt∣ful Depths made it the more troublesom. With these Dangers also came In∣conveniences; for the Island <HI>Bungo,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Cikoko,</HI> is but poorly stock'd from <HI>Cokero</HI> to <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> so that scarce any thing of the meanest Pro∣visions were to be had there.</P>
<P><HI>Wagenaer</HI> travell'd in that manner five days, leaving <HI>Jammanganomisacci</HI> and <HI>Assia</HI> on the right hand, and passing through the Kingdoms of <HI>Facata</HI> and <HI>Fisen,</HI> along a dirty way, made so by the continual Showrs of Rain that fall there.</P>
<P>In the City <HI>Fisen</HI> he refresh'd himself, where he got abundance of all manner of Provisions, and chiefly was entertain'd with a dainty Fish, not unlike a Salmon, being taken in the River <HI>Day,</HI> which washes the Castle <HI>Daymats.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the city <HI>Fisen,</HI> and the stately Castle <HI>Daymats.</HI></NOTE>This Castle is very beautiful to behold: The Governor thereof hath a Banquetting-house, built in the middle of the River, on thick Pillars, between which the Stream sets very swift; in it are several delightful and spacious Rooms; the lowermost jutting Roofs are all adorn'd with Golden Balls; un∣derneath them lye several Pleasure-Boats, to shelter them from the Weather.</P>
<P>The Burrough of the Castle <HI>Daymats</HI> affords a Habitation for the Custom∣ers which receive the Custom from the Ships which pass up and down the River, and the Revenues of the adjacent Countreys; so that there is a con∣tinual Concourse of People in this Place, not an Hour passing but one or other is carried in a Sedan to the Water-gate; others ride thither on Horses; some rouling of Packs and Barrels, others loading them on Carts drawn by Oxen.</P>
<P>Between this Burrough and the River <HI>Day,</HI> lies a Plain very convenient for Landing or Shipping of Goods which are to pay Custom, The Burrough it self hath three Gates; the chiefest lies on the Shore, where the Entrance be∣gins under a Roof, with two Trap-doors, between two Walls that rise higher and higher to the second Gate, made fast in the Wall on each side; the top of it appears a little above the Bulwarks: These Bulwarks have many Redoubts; on some of the outmost of them are square Watch-houses, two Stories high; within are several fair Houses, inhabited by the Customers.</P>
<P>From the Burrough a way leads up the Hill to the Castle, inclos'd between thick and high Walls, above which appear the Roofs of very stately Buildings.

<P>Moreover, <HI>Wagenaer</HI> staid till the first of <HI>November</HI> for the Ship the <HI>Black Bull,</HI> which was very richly laden; but because she did not come, he was fain to make a Market with <HI>Tonquean</HI> Silk, <HI>European</HI> Piece-Goods, as Cloth, Serges, Perpetuanaes, and <HI>Siam</HI> Furs, and promise upon an Obligation, That the <HI>Cargo</HI> in the <HI>Bull,</HI> when she came to an Anchor before <HI>Disma,</HI> should be laid up for the next Year.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable Passage of <HI>Martin Remei.</HI></NOTE>¶ IN the interim <HI>Wagenaer</HI> prepar'd the Ship the <HI>Singing Bird</HI> to go for <HI>Bata∣via,</HI> but was hindred one day by Accident: <HI>Martin Remei,</HI> a Native of <HI>Formosa,</HI> coming as Chyrurgeon from <HI>Tayovan,</HI> with the Ship <HI>Nieuport,</HI> to <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> had leave to inhabit ashore, in the hinder part of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Store-house on the Island <HI>Disma,</HI> with three Factors; but was miss'd in the Morning, on the thirteenth of <HI>November;</HI> yet they found at last a Letter in his Bed, that he rose to bereave himself of Life, because a <HI>Japan</HI> Whore, with whom he had lain three days, was gone away, by which means she had be∣reav'd him of his Pleasures. <HI>Wagenaer</HI> sent in vain to search all corners, either to find him living or dead: whereupon he made the Business known to the Magistrates, who gave immediate order, impowering some <HI>Bonjoises</HI> and In∣terpreters, and also their own Servants, to search all Houses and Skulking-places:
<PB N="433" REF="266"/>Whereupon they search'd the Ships, Jonks, and <HI>Japan</HI> Vessels; and indeed all <HI>Nangesaque</HI> was in an Uproar about it. <HI>Wagenaer</HI> caus'd his Men to Fish round about <HI>Disma,</HI> and was not a little troubled that he could not find <HI>Remei:</HI> For the Governors reported, That it was a <HI>Portugttese</HI> Priest, brought from <HI>China</HI> thither, that kept himself private with some yet undiscover'd <HI>Chri∣stians.</HI> But this Opinion soon vanish'd, when <HI>Remei</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>November,</HI> about the Evening, was brought bound on the Island <HI>Disma,</HI> to the great joy of those that kept the Watch when he made his escape; for they would all of them have lost their Lives for their Negligence.</P>
<P>This <HI>Remei</HI> was gotten over the Walls in the Night, and at low Water to the East side of the Haven before <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> where he hid himself under a long <HI>Chinese</HI> Straw Sail, till such time Hunger forc'd him to come out: But be∣ing instantly taken, was carried Prisoner to the Governor, who sent him to <HI>Wa∣genaer,</HI> and he kept him in safe custody, and sent him afterwards to <HI>Tayovan,</HI> there to suffer punishment according to his desert.</P>
<P>It hapned that at that time the Governor was in an exceeding good humor, who otherwise deals very severely with those that get ashore out of the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> Ships: Wherefore the <HI>Japanners</HI> take a List of the Names, Ages, and Offices of the Sea-men, to the smallest Youth, so soon as any Ship approaches the Harbor of <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> and if any one of them should be found wanting when they are going away, both Ship and Men would thereby happen into a great inconveniency, unless they could prove, that the Person which was wanting died a natural death, or with the Magistrates leave of <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> staid behind on the Island <HI>Disma.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Exploit of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Chirurgeon.</NOTE>Two Years after, hapned almost the like Accident. The Chyrurgeon be∣longing to the Admiral <HI>Vollenhoven</HI> leap'd over-board in the night, to swim aboard of a Jonk, that so out of Curiosity he might make a Voyage to <HI>China;</HI> which the Pilot made known to the Commander <HI>Indiik,</HI> who acquainted the Magistrates with it, which immediately sent Soldiers and Servants to make search for him; and if he should not be found, they threatned the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to let their Ships drive ashore, where with Goods and Men they would set them on Fire. On the third day he that fled Was fetch'd out of a <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonk, bound Hand and Foot, and thrown into the Emperors Prison, whence he escap'd not without great trouble, and Sums of Money; and was also for ever banish'd from <HI>Japan,</HI> upon pain of Death.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Japanners</HI> cut their Servants in the mid∣dle.</NOTE>¶ In this bloody Office they use no Executioners; but every one that buys a new Hanger, tries it either by cutting a Man, Woman, or Child through with both his Hands.</P>
<P>This kind of Exercise happens often, and chiefly when any <HI>Christians</HI> stand condemned; for they take them, and hang them up by the Feet on a Gibbet, with their Heads downwards into a Well, in which they cut several Holes, that the Blood may so drop out by degrees. Near the Gibbet on one side burns a continual Fire; on the other side waves a white Pennon, taken in every Evening, and put forth in the day-time, till the Malefactor be dead and burnt. But the nearest Relation to the so tormented <HI>Christian,</HI> as also three of his Neighbors, die, without sparing either Wives or Children, by the forementi∣on'd way of cutting them in at the left Shoulder, so bringing their Sword out under the right Arm.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chinese</HI> Merchant, can∣not sell their Goods.</NOTE>¶ AFter this, the <HI>Chineses</HI> in <HI>Coxenga</HI>'s Name complain'd again, about the taken Jonk which was call away before <HI>Tayovan;</HI> but were order'd to go to <HI>Batavia,</HI> to seek for redress there: Upon which, they gave out, That if they should come in <HI>Batavia,</HI> they should be murder'd; which Report of theirs was but little regarded. And they had not much better Success with their raw white Silk, of which they sold not one pound at <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> whereas, on the contrary, the <HI>East-India</HI> Company exchang'd al their <HI>Tonquean</HI> and <HI>Ben∣gala</HI> Silk, for good Silver; the <HI>Japan</HI> Merchants having agreed to bestow all their Moneys on the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> before they bought any thing of the <HI>Chineses.</HI> Mean while they finding nothing to do, were necessitated to depart from thence with their Merchandize, not without great damage: and should they but one or two Years more meet with such a bad Market, it would without all peradventure weaken and dishearten their great Navigation, and hinder them from sending yearly fifty loaden Jonks to <HI>Japan,</HI> to the great prejudice of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, who in many things are forc'd to give way to the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>¶ WHilst <HI>Wagenaer</HI> was preparing for his Voyage to <HI>Batavia,</HI> he receiv'd twenty one thousand seven hundred and sixty pieces of the best white Porcelan. A Month before the delivery of them, another Person had brought a considerable Parcel of Porcelan to sell on the Island <HI>Disma;</HI> but be∣cause they were too full of Flowers, most of them stuck on his Hands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japanners</HI> have some few years been more eager in making of Porcelan than heretofore;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> make great store of Porcelan.</NOTE> so that not onely the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> but also the <HI>Chineses</HI> vend a great deal thereof. The best place for this Commodity is the Lordship <HI>Fesen,</HI> of the Earth of which place they make it, being finer and whiter than else∣where. The <HI>Japanners</HI> grow every Year more and more experienc'd in this Art; so that they make their Porcelan better and better. <HI>Wagenaer</HI> contriv'd a small Flower to be made on a blue Ground; but was exceedingly amaz'd, when not long after he saw all the Shops full of them.</P>
<P>But whereas <HI>Fesen</HI> produces the best Porcelan in <HI>Japan;</HI> so in <HI>China,</HI> the Vil∣lage <HI>Sinktesimo.</HI> It is worthy our observation, That the Earth, which is not un∣like fine Sand, of which they bake their Porcelan, is digg'd up near the Me∣tropolis <HI>Hoeicheu,</HI> lying in the Territory of <HI>Nankin,</HI> where they onely knead it into Balls or Pellets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How it is made.</NOTE> which seal'd with the Emperors Arms, are sold at a cer∣tain price, and sent to <HI>Sinktesimo;</HI> for this Village onely, by a hidden Power
<PB N="435" REF="267"/>or Operation in the Waters there, makes the best Porcelan. Those that bake, are Rustical Clowns, brought up to that Trade from their Infancy. They prepare the Earth two several ways: Sometimes they work it so soon as it comes from <HI>Hoeichen,</HI> after the same manner as our <HI>European</HI> Potters prepare their Clay for their Pots and Pans. At other times they let it lye so long, till it is grown as hard as a Stone, which they afterwards stamp to Powder, sift it through a very fine Sieve, then mixing it with Water, knead it into Balls, and at last press it into a Wooden Frame, according to what fashion they please: Then they are first dry'd in the Wind, and put into an Oven, which fifteen days together is continually hot, and afterwards kept close as many days more, that so they may cool by degrees, or else they would: break all to pie∣ces. After thirty days the Oven is open'd, in the presence of one of the Em∣perors Officers, who narrowly looks on every Piece thereof, and, according to the Laws of the Countrey, takes away every fifth Piece of Porcelan to the Emperors use. The rest the Potters at <HI>Sinktesimo</HI> sell to the Inhabitants of <HI>Uci∣engen,</HI> a Village lying at the Lake <HI>Poyang,</HI> on the left hand Shore of the River <HI>Can.</HI> The Place is above two Miles long, rich for Traffick, and replenish'd with handsom Buildings; every Year so full with those that Trade in Porce∣lan, that one can scarce pass the Throng. The River lyes generally full of Barques, wherein they load, and so transport it over all the World: From hence appears the old mistake of their Opinion in <HI>Europe,</HI> believing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great mistake.</NOTE> That the Stuff of which they made the Porcelan was the Powder of Sea-Cockles, or Egg-shells, or else of Earth which their Fore-fathers prepar'd, and kept it a hundred Years after under Ground; so their Succeffors valu'd it according to its Age.</P>

<P>The <HI>Japanners</HI> hold it for an ancient Law, That as soon as ever the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Ammunition is brought aboard, whether in the Night or Day, contrary or fair Winds, they must go to Sea; but if by reason of contrary Winds they cannot get beyond the <HI>Priest-Mountain,</HI> they have above a hundred Watches about their Ship, which cutting their Cables, tow them out of the Haven of <HI>Nangesaque.</HI> In the <HI>Corean</HI> Ocean, generally, from <HI>September</HI> to <HI>April,</HI> a Nor∣therly Trade-wind blows so fresh, that they can scarce carry out their Top∣sails.</P>

It deserves our admiration, that the <HI>Japan</HI> Wo∣men exceed all other Females that are known in the World, for broad Faces, and great Heads; their Hair Wash'd everyday with the Whites of Eggs, shines like Jet: The Maids are distinguish'd from the Marry'd Women, by a Coyfe which they wear on their Fore-heads; whereas the Marry'd Women wear a loose Lock before, and another ty'd behind; they all go bare Headed in what Weather soever; but yet the primest Ladies wear an Embroyder'd Cap on their Heads, which is Peeked on the top; their Hair from under it, on both sides covers their Shoulders, behind hangs a Lock Brayded with Silk Ribbon: A large upper Gown, folded on their Breasts, is not onely rich for the Silken Ima∣ges

Moreover, all Gentlewomen of great Quality, whether Widows, Maids, or Marry'd Women never walk abroad without some Servant-Maids to attend them, of which every one knows her particular Office.

<P>Next this Mountain is another, but not so high; three Sulphurous Streams come flowing from them, which sometimes over-flowing, rushes into the Vallies, making a great Smother and noise, which also filling, seek their course another way, often warning down great Pieces of Rocks and Stones: All these three Streams running down on the Champain spreads it self a Mile and a half in length, but much more in breath: The Countrey round about the Moun∣tains is so excessive hot, that none can stand long there, but it will burn their Feet.</P>

These Vapors also are sometimes Waterish, and mixt with Earth, for if they were all Water, they could not melt, and if all Earth, they could not cleave and stick so hard together.

<P>Some Leagues distant lyes another call'd <HI>Tlaxcala,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tlaxcala. Hist. Nat.</HI> b. 3. l. 24.</NOTE> on which are continually Lightnings seen, and Thunders heard.</P>
<P>But the Mountain <HI>Guatimala</HI> exceeds them all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guatimala.</NOTE> whose spiring top shooting up to the Clouds, is seen a great distance off in the South-Sea. The three and twentieth of <HI>December, Anno</HI> 1586. it vomited forth whole Rivers of Fire and burning Matter, which afterwards descending, was found to be nothing but Ashes and burning Stones; and thus it continu'd six Months. Mean while the Earth also was so shaken, that it turn'd the City <HI>Guatimala</HI> topsie-turvey, and buried in its Ruines thousands of People.</P>
<P>About the same time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Los R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes.</NOTE> the Mountain near <HI>de Los Reyes</HI> threw up so much Ashes, that flying about the Countrey, it turn'd the Day into Night, insomuch that for several Miles none could go out of their Houses.</P>
<P><HI>Acosta</HI> relates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ignorance of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Priest.</NOTE> That a <HI>Spanish</HI> Priest thought to get Gold out of one of the Burning Mountains in <HI>America;</HI> for which purpose, he caus'd Iron Pots and Kettles to be made, to catch the several Matters that came flowing from it; but they no sooner touch'd the Flame, but they melted.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sicily</HI> the Mountain <HI>Aetna,</HI> now call'd <HI>Mongibelle,</HI> hath been famous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aetna.</NOTE> lying on a Promontory near the Mid-land Sea: An Eye-witness, <HI>Thomas Fazellus,</HI> de∣scribes it thus: <Q><HI>AEtna</HI> (says he) hath on the South and West sides of it great inhabited Villages, planted with extraordinary good Grapes, and all manner of other Fruit-Trees: The Ground pav'd with Pebble-stones, falling from the Hill in abundance: In some places Fountains spring up, in others flow delightful Rivers, which the Fire often swallows, or stops up with heaps of burnt Stone. There are also great Mill-stones found in the hanging of the Mountain, which were cast up <HI>Anno</HI> 1537. in a terrible Fire. The upper∣most part of this Mountain smokes continually, and sometimes Flames break through it, seen above a League in compass; the inner parts are consum'd by the Fire; a little below the top lyes Snow continually, which melts not in the hottest Summer; but when the Flames strike downwards, it floweth over, and pours down into the Valleys like a boyling Stream. In the fore∣mention'd year, the highest part of <HI>Aetna</HI> fell into the Hole; so that at present it gapes wider, but is not so high as formerly. The Hole from whence issue the Smoke and Flames, emits a continual thundering noise from its fathom∣less Bottom; and the other little Vent-holes always roar.</Q><HI>Philippus Cluverius</HI>
<PB N="448" REF="276"/>says, That he saw Stones ejected thence above sixty thousand Paces off; and that it also spoil'd a Way with its burning Sulphurous Streams, of four Leagues long, destroying all things before it.</P>
<P>Moreover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vesuvius.</NOTE> <HI>Vesuvius</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> is also very well known, which sometimes boyls over in that manner, that it fires <HI>Campania.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst other times, this Mountain burnt very terribly the sixth of <HI>October, Anno</HI> 473. the Ashes thereof flying as far as <HI>Constantinople,</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI> Empire for several years together, according to <HI>Joseph Scaliger,</HI> kept a Fast-day in re∣membrance of that dreadful Conflagration.</P>
<P>¶IT is very well worth bur Labor, to make an Inquiry, Why those Coun∣treys in which Burning Mountains are found, are generally very fruit∣ful? as appears by <HI>Campania,</HI> in which <HI>Vesuvius</HI> vomits continual Smoke and Fire; <HI>Sicily,</HI> famous (as we said before) for Mount <HI>Aetna;</HI> and <HI>Siurpurama,</HI> in the <HI>Japan</HI> Kingdom <HI>Voari.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of the Earthy Fire.</NOTE>It seems without contradiction, that there is Fire under Ground, which spreads it self through the Bowels of the Earth, no otherwise than the natural warmth of a Mans Heart diffuses it self through all his Body. This Truth appears plainly, because the Earth commonly smokes in the Winter time, and the Snow which falls on the Ground that is newly Plowed, melts instant∣ly: From the Water and Earth Vapors or Mists are drawn up by the Sun and Moon into the Air, where being cleansed, they fall down again in Hail, Rain, or Snow, which never sink above ten Foot deep into the Ground. The Heat of the Sun, warming the moist Earth, makes the Soil fruitful; but the Fire in its Bowels yields no small help, thereby as it were thrusting up the Seed and Plants.</P>
<P>The warm Fountains that spring out of the tops of the Mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warm Fountains.</NOTE> are no despicable Testimonies; for the Water being driven upwards by the Heat, forcing its way, spouts out; not unlike a Still, in which the purer Spirits or Moisture goes upwards, and through a Pipe come dropping from it; or like the Fumes which rise from the Stomach up into the Brain, where gathering Substance, Nature discharges them through the Mouth or Nose.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Warm Baths in <HI>Japan</HI> and other places.</NOTE>Also the warm Lakes or Baths do greatly testifie, that they are heated by a Fire inclos'd in the Earth; for if it were otherwise, how could the <HI>Japan</HI> Wa∣ter at <HI>Singok</HI> be of such force, that being pour'd on the Body, it should scorch the Flesh to the Bone? How could the <HI>Italian</HI> Pool near <HI>Parma,</HI> as <HI>Fallopius</HI> re∣lates, draw Flames to it, so that the Water being set on Fire, cannot be put out but by throwing Cloth over it, or else by a stiff Gale of Wind?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sulphur Mountain in <HI>Ja∣pan.</HI></NOTE>It deserves peculiar observation, That <HI>Siurpurama,</HI> without ever ceasing, should for so many Ages together pour down Sulphurous Streams, between decay'd Stones, that all the Ground thereabouts is chang'd into a kind of Sulphur.</P>
<P><HI>Italy,</HI> about <HI>Mutina,</HI> gives us a sufficient Testimony hereof: If the Pits out of which they dig Sulphur are fill'd up with Earth, it will in the space of four years be converted into Sulphur.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Necessity of the Earthy Fire.</NOTE>Lastly, This Earthly Fire is necessary for the making of Minerals, which being boyl'd by the Heat thereof, are molted and cleansed. The same Fire occasions also Earthquakes; wherefore sometimes upon the sinking of the Ground, which consum'd underneath falls in, terrible Flames break forth.</P>
<P>To conclude: By the abundance of Earthquakes, and richness of the Soil,
<PB N="449" REF="276"/>may easily be conjectur'd, That <HI>Japan</HI> hides great store of Sulphur in the Bow∣els of the Earth, which there serves for the Food of that Subterranean Fire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Indiik</HI>'s further Journey.</NOTE>¶ BUt <HI>Indiik</HI> leaving <HI>Siurpurama</HI> on his Larboard, came the fifth of <HI>April</HI> to <HI>Meaco,</HI> where by his Landlord he immediately made his Return known to the Governor <HI>Mackino Sandosamma,</HI> which presented <HI>Indiik</HI> with some Silk Coats, and gave him leave to depart: After which, he was carried by the Master of the House where he lodg'd to see a Comedy, wherein the <HI>Japanners</HI> are very neat and exact: The Players richly attir'd, represent on the Stage all the Transactions of Mankind so well, that they are no ways inferior to any of our <HI>European</HI> Comedians; and indeed <HI>Indiik</HI> would have judg'd better of them, could he have understood the <HI>Japan</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P>But <HI>Indiik</HI> having deliver'd a hundred <HI>Japan</HI> Silk Coats to his Landlord, to keep for the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, and seen the great Temple of <HI>Dayboth,</HI> and also several other Temples, left <HI>Meaco,</HI> and lodg'd in <HI>Fissima,</HI> where taking Shipping, he came to <HI>Osacca.</HI></P>
<P>From the City, his Landlord, with a great Train of Friends and Servants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Voyage.</NOTE> conducted him in two Pleasure-Boats to the Mouth of the River <HI>Osacca,</HI> where the Barque which had the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Goods aboard lay at Anchor: The Wind blowing fresh from the West, they could not make Sail. Mean while the Pleasure-Boats lying on each side of the Barque, the People went aboard her, and made merry with the <HI>Japan</HI> Wine which they had brought with them to drink at the Ambassadors departure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Journey through <HI>Bungo.</HI></NOTE>The third of <HI>May</HI> weighing Anchor, on the eleventh with Rowing and Sailing they pass'd by <HI>Simonisicci,</HI> and came to <HI>Cokero,</HI> where <HI>Indiik</HI> staying a Night, hired Horses and Men to travel through <HI>Bungo</HI> by Land to <HI>Nangesaque.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Bath at <HI>Orismo.</HI></NOTE>After he left <HI>Cokero,</HI> he came on the fourteenth day to <HI>Orismo,</HI> where he took great delight in a Stove or Bath, which was cover'd with a very handsom Roof: The Water came running through Copper Cocks into the Bath, from a Brook so hot on one side, that none can put in their Fingers without scald∣ing: But that which is no less strange, and a remarkable Privacy in Nature, is, that the same Brook on the other side flows extreme cold, in one Channel with the hot Water.</P>
<P>When they prepare a Bath, the Master thereof first lets the hot Water run in, which he afterwards tempers with the cold, as those that bathe require.</P>
<P>This Mystery of Nature is grounded on the Earthy Fire, by which the Waters being heated in deep Pits, spring upwards like a Fountain: But some Rivers have several Avenues and narrow Passages under the Earth, and so of∣ten lose their heat before they come to the top; when as others detain their warmth, because they flow through wide Channels, nearer the Subterranean Fire, from whence they rise up directly: It therefore happens (though very seldom) that two Fountains, of which one produces warm, the other cold Water, occasion'd by the foremention'd Reason, flow in one Channel, because each by its swift Course detains its own Property: And so it is with the Brook that in <HI>Orismo</HI> affords Water for the Bath.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baths very ancient, and several.</NOTE>It appears that the <HI>Japanners</HI> make use of the Profit which Nature bestows on these Waters, according to the Custom of several other People, after divers ways: For though Bathing was customary in former Ages, yet every Countrey observ'd a several way therein.</P>
<PB N="450" REF="277"/>
<P>The ancient <HI>Biscayners</HI> took not Water, but stinking Piss, with which they wash'd their Gums and naked Body.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scythians</HI> us'd Women, which pour'd Water on Mens Bodies, and after painted them with red Stones.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dardanians</HI> and <HI>Illyrians</HI> permitted a Man to Bathe but thrice in his Life∣time, <HI>viz.</HI> at his Birth, Marriage, and Death.</P>
<P>The ancient <HI>Germans</HI> made use of a River, in which they swam every day; though sometimes they went before Meals into a Bath, which was formerly observ'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> as at this day by the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two remarkable Won∣ders in the Bath at <HI>Orismo.</HI></NOTE>It will not be amiss to make some inquiry, why any one that before he bathes himself makes warm but having bathed, it comes cold from him; which happens because the Body before bathing is cold, but warm'd by bathing, makes the Urine cold.</P>
<P>It is also a strange Mystery, that those that when they go to bathe are no ways thirsty, by bathing become exceeding dry; and on the contrary, those that are desirous to drink when they go in, shall have no mind at all to it when they come out: The Reasons whereof may proceed hence, <HI>viz.</HI> Thirst is occasion'd by Drought; wherefore those that begin to bathe when adry, the Body draws through the Pores, by the inward force of the Vital Spirits, the thinnest Moisture, by which the Drought is quenched: But those that do not go thirsty into the Bath, force out their Drink by sweating, so that the Bo∣dy within becomes dry, and occasions Thirst.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> at first had dark and pittiful Baths; but when by their Power they had made great Conquests, they became Teachers of all Magnificence; which amongst other things they express'd in their Baths, the erecting and ordering of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches of the Baths.</NOTE> amaz'd the Eyes of the Beholders. A <HI>Roman</HI> (says <HI>Seneca</HI>) thought himself very poor, if the Walls of his Bath were not made of <HI>Alex∣andrian</HI> Marble, and adorn'd with <HI>Numidian</HI> Ledges; a <HI>Thesian</HI> Stone inclos'd the Water; the Floor consisted of pure Silver, imboss'd with Pearls and Dia∣monds; and the Edifice rested on stately Pillars, being hung round with Pi∣ctures, drawn by the Hand of the most excellent Masters. Moreover, they were attended by Barbers, Chyrurgeons, Men to rub them and help them out and in, some to keep their Clothes, and other Servants.</P>
<P>¶GReat delight the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador took in this strange Bath at <HI>Oris∣mo:</HI> But at length going forward in his Journey, he was nobly en∣tertain'd in the Provinces of <HI>Facata</HI> and <HI>Figen,</HI> the Lords of which Countreys provided Horses and Men for him, causing all the Streets of the Cities through which he pass'd, to be clean swept against his coming. The Governor of <HI>Oene∣warimet</HI> rode out of the City to meet and fetch in the Ambassador, in this or∣der: In the first Rank march'd five <HI>Japan</HI> Soldiers, which the Governor fol∣low'd on Horse-back, holding a Standard in his Hand; behind him came the Emperors Overseer and Warden, one after the other, under two <HI>Umbrelloes,</HI> made fast on long Sticks, each carried by three Men: These were follow'd by three Chariots, guarded on both sides with <HI>Japan</HI> Horse and Foot, in the mid∣dlemost whereof the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador was carried.</P>

The Fort <HI>Provincia</HI> yield∣ed upon the first Assault of the <HI>Chineses:</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> that liv'd up and down <HI>Formosa,</HI> are all cruelly murder'd: The City near the Castle <HI>Zealandia</HI> lies in Ashes in several places, but plunder'd in all: The Fort <HI>Zelandia</HI> was closely besieg'd: From the <HI>Hector</HI> Frigat, which engag'd with several Jonks, and was blown up by her own Powder, none were sav'd: The Ships <HI>Grave∣land</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> found themselves unable to engage with <HI>Coxenga</HI>'s Fleet; wherefore they fled from them: The Ships <HI>de Vink</HI> and <HI>Immenhorne</HI> come hi∣ther from <HI>Kelang,</HI> if they should want Provisions, or by their Enemies be forc'd to put to Sea again, they shall come to <HI>Japan,</HI> to fetch all things that you can send to our Assistance, with Provisions, as Rice, Meal, and <HI>Japan</HI> Wine; for our Store in the Castle begins to grow very scarce.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Indiik</HI> immediately made this sorrowful News known by an Interpreter to the Governor of <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> whilst the Ships <HI>Graveland</HI> and the <HI>Vink</HI> came to an Anchor before <HI>Disma.</HI> The Governor desir'd to have the whole Business of <HI>Formosa</HI> in Writing: And that he might have a true Account thereof, <HI>Indiik</HI> order'd, that the Merchant <HI>Nicholas Loenius,</HI> the Minister <HI>Mark Massius,</HI> and the Captain of the <HI>Graveland</HI> should come ashore, and relate the whole Circum∣stance.</P>

<P><HI>Indiik</HI> look'd upon this as a feigned Message, and onely a Business to search into the <HI>Hollanders</HI> intentions in taking the <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks.

All Peoples Laws granted free leave to resist force with force; so that a man doth not do mischief enough, though he useth his whole endeavors to spoil; and this is grounded on the Law of equal revenge. The whole Estate of <HI>Tayoan</HI> had been twice deliver'd in Writing to the Go∣vernor of <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> who had sent them to their Emperors Court; by which the Court was inform'd of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Design to do all the mischief they could to <HI>Coxenga,</HI> which cannot be ill resented, because it is not contra∣ry to the foremention'd Promise. Moreover, there is also another way to make <HI>Coxenga</HI> change his bloody War into Peace, which hath already been made known to <HI>Ficojemondonne:</HI> for if by order of the <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor, the present, and hereafter the following Goods and Moneys taken out of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks, should be kept by the Governor of <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> till <HI>Coxenga</HI> had satisfi'd the damage which he had done to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> he would then soon come to an Agreement: Yet if this Proposal should be dislik'd by the Em∣peror, another way might still be found; for the <HI>Holland</HI> Men of War to spoil his Trade to the <HI>Manilla's, Nanquien, Japan,</HI> and other Places, so by that means impoverishing, force him to an Agreement; for what will that trea∣cherous Robber do, when the Havens to which he Trades are block'd up by the <HI>Hollanders?</HI></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Father Discourse with <HI>Sacquemondonne</HI></NOTE>The Magistrate <HI>Sacquemondonne</HI> observing <HI>Indiik</HI>'s Answer, said, <Q>That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had right in the taking of <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks, but no Answer being come yet from the Emperor, they must forbear a while, that they might not incur the displeasure of the Court at <HI>Jedo.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Indiik</HI> answer'd again, <Q>The <HI>East-India</HI> Company joyn all their Forces to∣gether to please and serve the <HI>Japan</HI> Empire, but if they should suffer such wrongs as <HI>Coxenga's,</HI> they would soon be ruin'd by not seeking to subdue their Enemies, who like a small Fire, at first is easily quench'd, but let alone destroys whole Cities. It is too late to seek revenge when an Ene∣my, by neglecting of time, grows still more and more powerful, and some∣times grows to that heighth, that he no ways values his Antagonist. How is it possible to subdue <HI>Coxenga,</HI> if his rich laden Jonks come home safe and un∣molested from all Places? is he not thereby enabled to do more mischief? who will give a mad Man his Sword to be slain by it himself?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sacquemondonne</HI> acknowledge, that all <HI>Indiiks</HI> Discourse was grounded on Reason, but was suspicious of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks which lay richly laden in the Bay of <HI>Nangesaque:</HI> for if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did not observe the Emperor's Com∣mands,
<PB N="459" REF="281"/>what could then be expected, but that they would be all made Prize by the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships, of which there then lay a considerable number there? <HI>Indiik</HI> soon resolv'd him of this doubt; <Q>The <HI>Holland</HI> Ships (said he) are to put to Sea on a set-day, their going away is certain, before the <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks weigh Anchor. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> went on directly to the Place where they were sent, without looking after any. It might be true, several of their Fri∣gats Cruised to and again before <HI>Tayoan,</HI> and several Havens of <HI>China,</HI> waiting for the Jonks, and that which was done by those Ships he could not answer for, having no Command over them, as over those that lay at <HI>Nangesaque.</HI></Q></P>

<PB N="460" REF="282"/>stand on the Shore, seeming to stay there longing to see a miserable Shipwrack: two days the Storm continu'd, then growing calmer they weighed Anchor to get out of sight of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which like hungry Wolves watch'd for a Prey, shewing themselves in great numbers: afterwards the Ship was driven by the Current between <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Formosa;</HI> but soon after the Storm blowing afresh, they were not able to carry out the least Sail till the Gusts were more favora∣ble: mean while the Ship being so miserably toss'd sprung a Leak, so that they could scarce keep her free with Pumping; sometimes a Sea beat over her in such a manner, that the Water could scarce find ways to run out again, seeming as if it would sink immediately. With these inconveniences came far greater; for towards the Evening a Sea wash'd away one of the Galleries, and soon after another the Head, so loosning the Boltsprit; yet they had not been in such great danger, had not the Ship rowl'd so extremely, and the Seas follow'd one another so suddenly: they judg'd it convenient to hale up their Mizin, and Sail before the Wind; the second Watch they discover'd Land, but the Ship in the dark was got within Musquet-shot of the Shore before they could see it: the steep Shore suffer'd the Ship to run against a Rock, which with three blows broke it into a thousand pieces, and of sixty four Men escap'd onely thirty six, most of which were miserably wounded by the sharp Rocks; those that lay in their Cabbins, being tir'd with watching, died all: amongst those that were sav'd was the Captain, <HI>Reinier Egbertson</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> From the Wreck they sav'd one Barrel of Flower, one Barrel of Salt-Beef, some Pork, and a Rundlet of Tent, which prov'd very happily for the wounded. Moreover, they gather'd up as many Pieces of the Ship as would make them a Booth to defend them from the Weather; for they knew not in what Countrey they were, how call'd, or whether inhabited or not, because the Skie being Clouded for seve∣ral days, they could take no observation.</P>
<P>On the second day after they suffer'd Shipwrack they saw a Man, whom they beckning to come to them ran away; soon after came three other, of which one carry'd a Musquet, the other two Bows and Arrows, which also fled from them; but one of the Sea-men running after them unarm'd, got some Fire, which they wanted extremely. Against the Evening their Tent, or Booth, was surrounded with above a hundred Men, wearing Hats made of Horse-hair. The next day came a small Army, being about two thousand Foot and Horse, while the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were making of a bigger Tent. The Commander of them fetch'd the Book-keeper <HI>Henry Haemel,</HI> with the Pilot, Quartermaster,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange usage by the <HI>Core∣ans</HI> of thirty six Shi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wrack∣ed <HI>Hollanders.</HI></NOTE> and a Boy, out of the Booth, which were all four thrown down on the Earth before the General, at which the whole Army made a kind of strange noise. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> that remain'd in the Tent, believ'd certainly, that their Companions were put to a miserable death; but they us'd them not so cruelly: for the <HI>Coreans</HI> onely put an Iron Chain about their Necks, to which a great Bell was made fast under their Chin. Then some of the Offi∣cers went into the Booth, and had a great deal of Discourse which the <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI> understood not; but they signifi'd to them that they intended to go to <HI>Japan,</HI> but suffering Shipwrack they were come ashore there to save themselves. The <HI>Chineses</HI> look'd upon those Goods which they had sav'd, and finding onely a little Meal, Salt-Beef and Pork, they brought some Rice boyl'd in Water, which was a great refreshment. Not long continu'd their joy that they were not in a barren Countrey; for whilst they were eating, a great many of the Soldiers came running towards their Tent, every one holding a Rope in his
<PB N="461" REF="282"/>hand, which made the <HI>Hollanders</HI> think that they should be bound and kill'd: but this fear soon vanish'd, when the <HI>Coreans</HI> ran with all speed towards the Wreck, every one laboring to hale the Wood ashore, which burning they carry'd the Iron away. In the interim the Pilot taking an observation, found that it was <HI>Quelpaerds-Island</HI> where they had lost their Ship, and were in thirty three Degrees and thirty two Minutes Latitude. Moreover, the <HI>Coreans</HI> still busied themselves in haling ashore the Pieces of the Wreck, and burning it for the Iron; and lastly they set the whole Wreck on Fire, which might have cost them dear: for two Brass-Guns deeply loaden went off, but it so hapned, that the Muzzles of them lay towards the Sea: this Blow struck such a fear amongst them, that every one fled, and coming to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> desir'd to know of them if it would do the like again; but they informing that there were no more Guns that were Charged in the Ship, they went on with their work.</P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> visited the Governor of <HI>Quelpaerds-Isle,</HI> and present∣ed him with a Bottle of Tent, which pleas'd him so well, that he became very kind to them, sending them boyl'd Rice twice a day, and bid them come and see the punishment which would be inflicted on those that had robb'd the wreck'd Vessel. The Iron they had stole was tied to their Backs, and they themselves laid upon the Ground, receiv'd several Drubbings on the Balls of their Feet with a Stick about a Fathom long, and as thick as an ordinary Boy's Arm, so beating them unmercifully.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Journey through <HI>Quelpaerds-Island.</HI></NOTE>After this was over, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had order to be gone with all their things; so travelling with a Guard of Foot and Horse, they went that day four Leagues, and Lodg'd in a small Town call'd <HI>Tadjunch,</HI> in an old Store-house: from thence they went to the City <HI>Moggan,</HI> where the Governor of <HI>Quelpaerds</HI> keeps his Court; here on a great Market place three thousand Armed Men were drawn up in Battel aray: The Governor caus'd <HI>Henry Hamell,</HI> with the Pilot and Quartermaster to come to him, and ask'd them where they were going? at which <HI>Hamel</HI> cry'd several times, <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> at which the Gover∣nor nodding his Head seem'd to understand it. The remaining <HI>Hollanders</HI> were also carry'd four and four to the Governor, Examin'd, and Lodg'd in a House, in which, as they afterwards understood, the Kings Uncle had a long time been kept Prisoner, and at last died there, because he endeavor'd to depose his Nephew. Every day they had their allowance of boyl'd Rice, wheaten Flower, and another strange Food which they could not eat, wherefore they liv'd most upon Rice. The Governor, a Man aged about seventy years, and of a noble Aspect, signifi'd to them, that he would Write to the King, to know what should be done with them, but it would be a considerable time before he could have an Answer; for the Place where the King kept his Court was thir∣teen Leagues over-Sea, and above twenty Leagues from <HI>Moggan:</HI> But whilst they waited for it, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had fresh Meat allow'd them, and also leave for six at a time to walk abroad by turns. The Governor oftentimes invited them to his Palace, bidding them write their Names; and cur'd those that were wounded at their Landing; and also prepar'd several noble Dinners for them: In which kind Hospitality-the <HI>Heathens</HI> far exceed very many <HI>Chri∣stians.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange adventure of a <HI>Hollander.</HI></NOTE>But amongst several strange Adventures, that is most remarkable which hapned to the Book-keeper <HI>Hamel,</HI> Pilot, and Chirurgeon: These, as former∣ly, carry'd before the Governor, found a Man sitting by him with a red Beard,
<PB N="462" REF="283"/>and being ask'd if they knew not such a Man? they answer'd, That he seem'd to be a <HI>Hollander;</HI> at which the Governor fell a laughing: at last the red-Bearded Man discovering himself, ask'd them in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Tongue, what Peo∣ple they were? and whether they were going? at which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were allamaz'd, but <HI>Hamel</HI> answering, said, <Q>That they Sail'd from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and from <HI>Batavia</HI> to <HI>Japan;</HI> but since they left <HI>Formosa</HI> they were over∣taken by a mighty Storm, which drove the <HI>Sperwer</HI> Frigat, already torn and shatter'd, against the Rocks of the Island <HI>Quelpaerds.</HI></Q><HI>Hamel</HI> also ask'd him what he was? and although he had almost forgot his Native Tongue, yet he told him <Q>That he was born in a Village call'd <HI>De Riip</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> and nam'd <HI>John Johnson Welterre,</HI> and that <HI>Anno</HI> 1626. he Sail'd in a Ship from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> afterwards by order of the <HI>Indian</HI> Councel in <HI>Batavia</HI> Sail'd in the <HI>Ouwerkerk</HI> Ketch to <HI>Japan,</HI> but by contrary Winds forc'd upon the Coast of <HI>Corea,</HI> fresh Water began to grow very scant; wherefore (said he) I was commanded, with my Countreyman <HI>Derick Gerritson,</HI> and an <HI>Amster∣dammer</HI> call'd <HI>John Peterson Verbaest,</HI> to go ashore, to see if we could find any fresh Water: no sooner had we set foot ashore, but we were all three sur∣rounded and carry'd up into the Countrey to the King's Court, where ever since we have had Meat, Drink, and Clothing, but could never obtain leave to go with some Vessel or other to <HI>Japan:</HI> and though he had for several years entreated leave of the Court to depart, yet they had always one An∣swer, which was, <HI>That the King did not give leave to any Strangers to go out of his Kingdom:</HI> which Sentence all <HI>Hollanders,</HI> or what else soever they be, are sure to undergo. Moreover (said he) my two Companions died seventeen years ago, at the time when the <HI>Tartars</HI> invaded <HI>Corea.</HI></Q></P>
<P>All which Discourse being Interpreted to the Governor, was written down and sent to the Court.</P>
<P>Mean while the time came, in which the old Governor was to give place to the new; for every three years they observe change of Government amongst the <HI>Coreans.</HI> The old Lord had a very great inclination for the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> for before he went away he provided them against the next Winter, giving every one a Coat, a pair of Buskins and Stockings. He also return'd them the Books which he had taken from them; and gave them good store of Train-Oyl to burn in their Lamps at Night, promising them also at last, that he would use all the means possible at Court to obtain leave for their going to <HI>Japan.</HI> But the new Governor prov'd quite another Man, for he carry'd himself very strange to the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> and since the departure of the first Lord in the be∣ginning of <HI>January, Anno</HI> 1654. they wanted Provisions, being ty'd to very small allowance, which made their imprisonment very insufferable: wherefore since they had yet liberty to go out by sixes at a time, they searched daily if they could not find any Vessels lying near the Shore, with which they might in the Night make their Escape.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable passage of five <HI>Hollanders.</HI></NOTE> The last of <HI>April</HI> six Prisoners endeavor'd in the Night to get over the Wall; but discover'd by the Barking of the Dogs, which wakened the Watchmen, their Design took no effect. After which time the Pilot and five more resolv'd on the like Escape: These going out upon a Day which fell to their turn, found some distance from the City <HI>Moggan,</HI> hard by a small Village, a little Vessel with all Necessaries thereto belonging, where going aboard they hal'd it over a Bank in sight of the Villagers, which at first were amazed to see them; but afterwards observing that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were in earnest they put off to Sea, gave notice thereof to the Owner, who with a Gun
<PB N="463" REF="283"/>charged came running after them in the Water, whilst they were busie setting up the Mast and Sail; but not being acquainted with the <HI>Corean</HI> Vessels, both Mast and Sail fell over-board; yet they got it up again, and put all things in their right place; when placing the Mast it broke out, so that it fell all again into the Sea, by which means they lost all hopes of escaping, driving more and more to the Shore, and exactly towards a Barque full of Armed <HI>Coreans,</HI> which they boarding, the five <HI>Hollanders</HI> leap'd over into the same, for the sixth could not get in; by this their leaping the Arm'd Barque shipp'd so much Wa∣ter, that they had enough to do to keep her from sinking: but when Landed, they carry'd the five <HI>Hollanders</HI> to the Governor, who caus'd them all to be loaden with Fetters, hung a Board about their Necks, on which he nail'd one of their Hands, and stripping them laid them on the Ground upon their Bellies, so ty∣ing them fast to four Posts, sent for the remaining <HI>Hollanders</HI> thither to see them: thus laid, the Governor caus'd the Interpreter <HI>Weltevree</HI> to ask them, If they had agreed upon their Escape without the knowledge of their Compani∣ons? or if they knew of their Design? How they durst venture to go in so small a Vessel without Water, Bread, or any other sustenance, through so vast an Ocean to <HI>Japan?</HI> The fetter'd <HI>Hollanders</HI> answer'd, That their Compani∣ons had not the least knowledge of their Design. Moreover, they would ra∣ther run all hazards whatsoever for their liberty, nay rather die, than undergo so many miseries, and at last be starv'd to death: which they had no sooner said, when an Executioner, standing in the middle of them, with a Stick a Fathom long, a Finger thick, and round on the top, gave every one twenty five blows on their bare Buttocks, that none of them in five Weeks were able to stir out of their Cabbins.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollanders</HI> carry'd to <HI>Corea,</HI> and their chief Ad∣ventures.</NOTE>But whilst they lay in that misery, Orders came from the <HI>Corean</HI> Court, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> divided into four Jonks should be sent fetter'd from <HI>Quelpaerds-Island</HI> to <HI>Corea:</HI> upon which the Governor began his Cruelties afresh, linking both their Feet and one hand together, fearing else they might conquer and carry away one of the Jonks, which indeed would have been hazardous if they had gone aboard unbound; and the more, because the <HI>Coreans</HI> are gene∣rally Sea-sick. Two days they were toss'd up and down at Sea, and not get∣ting the least Ground because of contrary Winds, they return'd to <HI>Moggan,</HI> where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were put into their old Prison.</P>
<P>¶ THis <HI>Quelpaerds-Island</HI> reckons fifteen Leagues in its Circumference; hath on the North-side a convenient Harbor for Ships, and lies opposite from the South Promontory of <HI>Corea</HI> thirteen Leagues; the Passage to which is very dangerous, because the Water is full of blind Rocks, and no anchorage to be found betwixt that and <HI>Quelpaerds</HI> Haven; so that those Ships that are by a Storm, either out of the East or South-east driven from the Coast of <HI>Japan</HI> thi∣ther, are easily lost.</P>
<P>This Island affords store of Provisions, is full of People, Horses and Cattel; in the middle a high Mountain, crown'd with Trees, seems to touch the Clouds: the lesser Hills have barren tops, yet the Valleys abound in Rice, Wheat, and Barley.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their remarkable Jour∣ney there.</NOTE>¶ AFter five days time, the Wind changing, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> as before, were again Shipp'd aboard of four Jonks, and getting to <HI>Corea</HI> at Sun-set, were carry'd ashore at the Sun-rising; where being furnish'd with Horses,
<PB N="464" REF="284"/>they all met together in the City <HI>Heinan,</HI> whither they came in four several Companies; for the four Jonks Landed them all in several Places. Whilst they Lodg'd in <HI>Heinan,</HI> the Governor <HI>Paul Johnson Kool</HI> died, having never en∣joy'd his health since he suffer'd Shipwrack. The Commander of their Guard gave order to bury the Corps: after which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> travell'd through the Cities <HI>Sansiang</HI> and <HI>Tiongop,</HI> and also by the great Castle <HI>Jypansangians,</HI> built up∣on a Rock: then they past the Town <HI>Tunge,</HI> and the great City <HI>Sendy,</HI> where some years ago the King of <HI>Corea</HI> kept his Court, but was now onely the Resi∣dence of a Vice-Roy. Going from hence they Lodg'd in <HI>Jesorn,</HI> the last City in the Territory <HI>Thielado.</HI> Lastly, after they had travell'd seventy Leagues, and besides the foremention'd Villages, pass'd through <HI>Lynjin, Jesaen</HI> and <HI>Consio,</HI> they came into the Royal City <HI>Sioor;</HI> where not long after they were Examin'd at Court by the Interpreter <HI>Weltevree;</HI> whereupon the Prisoners declaring their whole Adventure, at last begg'd that they might have leave to go for <HI>Japan,</HI> that they might once more see their Wives and Children: which their Request was deny'd, receiving this Answer, <HI>That the King never suffer'd any Stranger to go out of his Countrey, therefore they must not think of any thing, but to die in</HI> Corea.</P>
<P>Soon after every <HI>Hollander</HI> receiv'd a small Board, with the King's Arms burnt on it, and every ones Name, Extract, and Office which he was to per∣form, Carv'd on the same in <HI>Corean</HI> Letters. <HI>Weltevree</HI> bore the Command as Sergeant over them all. An expert Soldier taught them to handle the <HI>Corean</HI> Arms, and whilst they were busie in learning this Martial Discipline, the <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI> according to their custom, came to fetch in his Revenues from <HI>Corea:</HI> whereupon the King sent the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to the strong Castle <HI>Nanna Sansiang,</HI> built on a Rock seven Leagues beyond <HI>Sioor,</HI> to which in time of need the King takes his flight.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange undertaking of two Sea-men.</NOTE>When the <HI>Tartars</HI> went the second time out of <HI>Sioor,</HI> the chief Pilot <HI>Henry Johnson</HI> an <HI>Amsterdammer,</HI> and the Gunner <HI>Henry vander Boss</HI> also went out with them, under a pretence to cut some Wood for Fewel, but their Design was to intermeddle themselves with the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Horse, that if so they might find a Way home through <HI>Tartary:</HI> they stay'd therefore till the said Horsemen with the <HI>Corean</HI> Money were half pass'd by, then running amongst them, but were known by some <HI>Coreans</HI> that follow'd after, and re-taken, put close Prisoners, where not long after they dy'd. Their Companions could never be certainly inform'd if they dy'd a natural death, or whether they were Executed.</P>
<P>During this time, news was brought to the King's Court, that another Ship was lost on <HI>Quelpaerds</HI> Island, wherefore three <HI>Hollanders</HI> that best understood the <HI>Corean</HI> Tongue were sent thither, because <HI>Weltevree</HI> being over-grown with Age, was not able to Travel. Lastly, The King grown weary of the <HI>Hollan∣ders,</HI> resolv'd to make them away by Murder, but the King's Brother begging their Lives, (as <HI>Weltevree</HI> inform'd them) they were sent to the strong Castle <HI>Thiellapeing,</HI> where they found the three <HI>Hollanders</HI> sent to <HI>Quelpaerds</HI> Island, here being a House provided, in which the thirty three <HI>Hollanders</HI> were Lodg'd. The Governor seem'd to have some small inclination for the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> but his Successor a hatred, forcing them to fetch Fuel three Leagues off, over the Hills, and kept those Clothes from them, which they were promis'd at the <HI>Corean</HI> Court, so that they endur'd extream cold, and were also very much plagued with Lice, which almost kill'd them; yet it happen'd at last, that half of the Prisoners had leave by turns to go a begging, whilst the other half staid at home, for the <HI>Coreans</HI> seldom deny any requir'd Alms, and chiefly the Priests, which
<PB N="465" REF="284"/>being there in great abundance, are very charitable. These kind of People en∣tertain'd them very courteously, the more, because they began to speak the <HI>Co∣rean</HI> Tongue, and related to them the Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> in which they took great pleasure.</P>
<P>¶<HI>ANno</HI> 1660. A new Governor succeeded the old one of <HI>Thiellapeing,</HI> he be∣ing of a quiet and mild disposition, Protested oftentimes, that if it were in his Power, he would release the <HI>Hollanders</HI> instantly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Famine in <HI>Corea.</HI></NOTE> In the second Year arose a great Famine in <HI>Corea,</HI> the over-dry Seasons having so scorch'd the Ground, that thousands of People dy'd of Hunger, some eating Wild Herbs, others Barks of Trees; and had not the Valleys afforded them some Corn, most of the People had been Starv'd. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> bore no small share in this general Calamity. Their allowance which was given them by the King's Or∣der, being exceedingly pinch'd.</P>
<P>In the interim, Order came from Court, that the two and twenty <HI>Hollanders,</HI> (for the rest dy'd of hardship) were to be divided into three Towns, twelve should go and live in <HI>Saysing,</HI> five at <HI>Sutsen,</HI> and as many more at <HI>Wammon,</HI> and whilst they suffer'd either more or less inconveniencies, according to the Dis∣positions of the Governors, which chang'd every three year, who either us'd them kind or cruelly, there appear'd two Blazing Stars, or Comets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blazing Stars.</NOTE> about the latter end of 1664. The first appear'd in the South-East, the second in the South-West. These Signs struck the <HI>Coreans</HI> into a great Consternation, because the same were seen just before the <HI>Tartars</HI> Invaded them, and also when the <HI>Ja∣panners</HI> sent over their Forces thither. The <HI>Coreans</HI> therefore enquir'd of the <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI> What those Planets Prognosticated? What the <HI>Europeans</HI> thought of them? They answer'd, That experience had sufficiently taught, that those Stars were always very Prodigious Signs, generally threatning War, Famine, or Sickness. The King exceedingly amaz'd, Fortifi'd all his Towns, Castles, and Bulwarks, with double Watches; and forbad strictly, that none living near the Sea-side should burn Lights at Night.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable passage of eight <HI>Holland</HI> Prisoners.</NOTE>¶ BUt the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at last found a way to make their escape, they having a long time before gather'd some Moneys together, for which they in∣tended to buy an old Fishermans Barque; it being subtilly contriv'd, to make their Landlord believe, that they would now and then go to the small Islands before <HI>Corea,</HI> to fetch Cotton from thence, of which he should have his share. This Proposal was very well approv'd of by the <HI>Coreans,</HI> so buying a small Ves∣sel, he gave it to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who, what e're they could catch, whether Sails, Anchors, or Provisions, in the Night carry'd them Aboard, and whilst they were thus busie, preparing for their departure, the Chyrurgeon <HI>Matthew Bokken, Cornelius Derickson,</HI> and <HI>John Pieterson de Uries,</HI> came from the City <HI>Sutsen</HI> to visit their Countreymen in <HI>Saysing.</HI> These being made acquainted with the Design, forwarded it with all diligence, and indeed it fell out very fortunately, for <HI>De Uries</HI> was exceeding well experienc'd in the Art of Navigation. The fourth of <HI>September, Anno</HI> 1666. they began their Voyage eight of them, being <HI>Henry Ha∣mel, Goverard Dionys, John Pieterson de Uries, Garret Johnson, Matthew Bokken, Corne∣lius Derickson, Benedict Clark,</HI> and <HI>Dionys Govertson,</HI> first clambering over the Walls of <HI>Saysings,</HI> and getting Aboard, Weigh'd Anchor about Ebbing Water, and set∣ting of the Moon, they furnish'd themselves with Water at a small Island near <HI>Corea,</HI> and in the dark, Sail'd thorow all the Jonks of War: In this passage they
<PB N="466" REF="285"/>strook Sail, that so they might not be discover'd, and fell to Work with their Oars, till they lost sight of <HI>Corea;</HI> so Steering South-East, they went right be∣fore the Wind, and in a short time got to the Westward of <HI>Goto,</HI> where the Wind blowing very fierce, they came to an Anchor; here whilst they Rode fast, a small Vessel with six Men, every one Arm'd with two Swords, came Sailing by them, and put one of her Men a Shore, which causing some suspicion in them, made them Weigh Anchor, and endeavor to put off again to Sea; but the foresaid Vessel prevented them, by making signs, that they must strike their Sail, and come farther up into the Haven; at which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> cry'd, <HI>Hol∣lande, Nangesaque,</HI> whilst they were Tow'd to the Shore, and surrounded with a great many Boats.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japanners</HI> took two Men out of the <HI>Corean</HI> Barque, which went a Shore where all things were in an uprore; and about Midnight, a great Barque came Rowing close by their sides, which inform'd them of the Arrival of the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships at <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> which made them take fresh courage, as well as the <HI>Japan∣ners,</HI> furnishing them with Provisions for nothing; who also cover'd the <HI>Core∣an</HI> Barque, which had no shelter with Mats against the continual Rain. The four∣teenth of <HI>September,</HI> after thirteen years Imprisonment, they came to their Coun∣treymen on the Island <HI>Disma,</HI> to their great admiration.</P>

<P>¶ BUt the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador prosecuting his Voyage to <HI>Jedo,</HI> was over∣taken by a stiff Gale out of the North-East in the <HI>Corean</HI> Ocean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the migh∣ty City <HI>Congoxuma.</HI></NOTE> that running right before it with her Fore-Sail, he soon arriv'd in the Haven of <HI>Con∣goxuma,</HI> and dropt Anchor before the <HI>Beacon-Hill,</HI> which was first, with the Approbation of the <HI>Japanners,</HI> built by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> at the time when they drove a free Trade there.</P>
<P><HI>Congoxuma</HI> is the first City, where the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Landed, and got footing in <HI>Japan,</HI> by the means of a <HI>Japan</HI> Youth, call'd <HI>Angier,</HI> who fearing the cruelty of his Persecutors, secur'd himself in a <HI>Japan</HI> Cloyster, where he made his escape to <HI>Malacca,</HI> whither he Sail'd in a Merchant-Man, Commanded by the <HI>Portugal George Alvares, Anno</HI> 1547. The Jesuit <HI>Francis Xaverius</HI> coming acquainted with him there, he not long after went with him to <HI>Congoxuma,</HI> where being kindly Entertain'd by <HI>Angier</HI>'s Friends, he had an opportunity to Plant the <HI>Roman Re∣ligion.</HI></P>
<P>After this, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> made this City <HI>Congoxuma</HI> their Staple, for which it lay very convenient in the Kingdom of <HI>Saxuma;</HI> the foresaid Beacon square on the top, with a Turn'd Ball, stands on a thick Cedar Pole, supported with two great pieces of Timber, which on the top are fasten'd to the Pole with great Iron Hooks; a high Ladder, of which the Rounds jet out beyond the sides, stands against, and leads up to it; below is a Watch-house, and on the other side several Houses built on the hanging of the Mountain; onely in some pla∣ces the tops of the Houses appear above the Hills. This Beacon, Sea-men can discover about seven Leagues off at Sea, because the Rock on which it stands is of an excessive height; at the Foot thereof, a little towards one side is a Fishers Village, and before that, good Ground to Anchor in, close under the Shore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reception of the <HI>Hol∣land</HI> Ambassador.</NOTE>¶ THe <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador Sail'd in a stately Jonk towards the City against a swift flowing River, which comes along thorow the mid∣dle of <HI>Congoxuma,</HI> from a Harboring Mountain, and runs into the <HI>Corean</HI> Ocean. The speedy Current of the <HI>Rhone</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> or the <HI>Donaw</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> flow but slowly in comparison of this, which passeth thorow <HI>Coxenga.</HI> The Jonk in which the Ambassador was, had two Masts, between which stood a Tent, or rather a Cabbin on six Pillars, the edges adorn'd with Gilded Imagery; before on her Bow, hung two Anchors. Thus he Sail'd in, between steep and high Rocks, of which, some terrifi'd the Beholders as they were passing by them.</P>
<P>Within the Harbor appears a strong and Artificial Water-Castle, built by <HI>On∣goschio,</HI> the Emperor <HI>Chongon</HI>'s Grand-Father, when he design'd to take the Crown from <HI>Fideri Taicosama</HI>'s Son; because <HI>Congoxuma</HI> was a place of great concern to him; for this City is not onely the Key of the Province <HI>Saxuma,</HI> but of all <HI>Bungo.</HI> This Water-Castle rais'd out of the Sea with Free-Stones, is square, with many Redouts, like the <HI>European</HI> Bulwarks. Here is kept a strong Garrison, where the Ships pay Custom. Moreover, the Stone-Causey made up out of the Sea, and along the Rails on both sides Plated with Copper, de∣serves no small admiration. This Causey leads from the Water-Castle, to two great Watch-houses, the Out-walls of which rest on the said Causey, and have an excellent Prospect of all the Haven, each of them Garrison'd with five hundred of the Emperors Souldiers, which have a continual eye with those in the Water-Castle on all Transactions, because the King of <HI>Saxuma</HI> hath often∣times
<PB N="468" REF="289"/>boldly taken up Arms against the Emperor, refusing to pay him the usual Tribute, but still been brought to reason; yet notwithstanding his bad For∣tune, he would now and then take fresh Courage, and receive more Losses: between the Watch-houses and the Mountain, on the North-side of the City is a convenient Harbor, in which the Jonks and other Vessels in great numbers come to an Anchor, or are moor'd to the Shore: Close by are the City Store-Houses, built on a Stone-Wall, rais'd out of the Water, in the middle whereof is a large square Gate, with the Stairs of Free-Stone, that descend into the Ha∣ven, at which all the Goods and Merchandizes that are brought to <HI>Coxenga,</HI> are Landed and carry'd into the City. The Store-houses on the North-side of the Gate; consists of four spacious Halls; but that which is on the other side hath a double Roof, and fourteen large Rooms, besides Garrets. Between the North Store-house, and the Watch-houses, the River flows out of the City into the Haven, and is adorn'd on one side with brave large Custom-houses, in which, Art shews its Master-piece, no Charge having been spar'd in the building of them; here the Ships must pay a second Custom, which brings in a great Re∣venue yearly to the Emperor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Temple, in which ley wash their dead.</NOTE>¶ BUt opposite to these Toll-houses, appears a stately Temple, in which the Bodies of Dead Persons are plac'd, for some days before they are burnt, after the <HI>Japan</HI> manner. The <HI>Bonzies</HI> belonging thereto, get vast Sums of Money, especially from the rich People, for cleansing of the dead Bodies, that they may appear the more acceptable to their Gods, <HI>Amida, Canon,</HI> or any other whom they chiefly serv'd in their Life time. This kind of Custom of keeping the Dead Bodies Unbury'd for some time, to cleanse and then to burn them, hath been in use a long time in the World; for the Ancient <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> observ'd such a Custom with their Dead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Phenissis.</NOTE> before the Birth of our Saviour. The <HI>Greek</HI> Tragedy written by <HI>Euripides</HI> brings in King <HI>Creon,</HI> saying:</P>
<Q><L>I will withdraw, that so <HI>Jocasta</HI> may</L>
<L>From her Sons body, cleanse the filth away.</L></Q>
<P>I understand that the <HI>Dardanian Illyrians</HI> (saith <HI>Aelian</HI>) are wash'd three times,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aeliani var. Hist.</HI> l. 4. c. 1.</NOTE> once when born, a second time when Marry'd, and lastly, when they are dead. The <HI>Jews</HI> also observ'd this Washing of Dead Bodies, St. <HI>Luke</HI> saith of <HI>Tabytha, And it came to pass in those days,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act 9.37.</NOTE> <HI>that she was sick and dy'd; whom when they had wash'd, they laid in an upper Chamber.</HI> The Embalming of Dead Bodies is full as Ancient. <HI>Tacitus, Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Pomponius Mela, Cicero, Sextus Philosophus, Lucian,</HI> and other Ancient <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Writers ascribe the first Embalming of the Dead to the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> with which Opinion the Gospel agrees; for <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> relates, that the Patriarchs <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Joseph</HI> were Embalm'd by the <HI>Egypti∣ans: And</HI> Joseph <HI>commanded his Servants the Physitians to Embalm his Father:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 50.2, 3, 26.</NOTE> <HI>and the Physitians Embalmed</HI> Ifrael. <HI>And forty days were fulfilled for him (for so are fulfilled the days of those that are Embalmed) and the</HI> Egyptians <HI>mourned for him three∣score and ten days. And</HI> Joseph <HI>died being a hundred and ten years old, and they Embal∣med him, and he was put in a Coffin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sextus Philosophus</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pyrrb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. Hypothes.</HI> 6.24.</NOTE> That the <HI>Egyptians</HI> took out the Bowels of the de∣ceas'd Bodies, and fill'd them with Balsom, and other Perfumes, to preserve them from stinking and rotting, and kept them in their Houses, letting them at the Table with them:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Syl. Ital.</HI> l. 12.</NOTE> Of which the <HI>Latin</HI> Poet <HI>Sylvius Italicus</HI> saith thus:</P>
<PB N="469" REF="289"/>
<Q><L><HI>Egypt</HI> Embalms her Dead with rich Perfumes,</L>
<L>And then at Feasts gives them the chiefest Rooms.</L></Q>
<P>Nay, they oftentimes gave the dead Bodies of their Parents or near Rela∣tions as a Security to their Creditors, which if they did not release whilst they liv'd, might not (saith <HI>Lucian</HI>) be buried.</P>
<P>Moreover they us'd for their Embalming Salt, Cedar-Oyl Honey, Wax, Myrrhe, Chalk, Lime, Asphalt, and Nitre.</P>
<P>The Washing of Bodies was perform'd by the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Women. <HI>Plato</HI> brings in <HI>Socrates</HI> saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>Phadono.</HI></NOTE> <HI>It is convenient before I drink the Poyson that I wash my self, that I may not leave any thing to do for the Women, to wash me after I am dead.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Japanners</HI> seem also to have learnt from the <HI>Romans,</HI> That the prepara∣tions for the Burial are to be perform'd in the Temples, for all things necessa∣ry for Funerals were to be had for Money in the Temple of <HI>Libitina,</HI> Goddess of the Dead. And according to the establishment of the <HI>Roman</HI> King <HI>Numa Pompi∣lius,</HI> every one was bound to throw certain Sums of Money into the Treasury of <HI>Juno Lucina,</HI> when ever they had a Child born, and also when any one dy'd, into a Pot, Consecrated to <HI>Venus Libitina:</HI> But the Embalming of Dead Bodies was perform'd by Men.</P>
<P>Moreover, not far from this Temple, towards the City, are several Stone Store-houses against Fire, in which the Treasures of all the Province of <HI>Saxuma</HI> are kept, and are once a year, by the Emperors Forces fetch'd to <HI>Osacca;</HI> be∣tween these Buildings and the Water-Castle stands a fair Temple, to which the Countrey People come daily in great numbers, there to Pray for a Blessing on their Plants, Trees, and Cattel, to which they shew Reverence, almost like the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> who in former times us'd to honor their Idol <HI>Pan</HI> with a Goats Face and Bucks Feet, as a Deity plac'd over all Herdsmen and Hunters; and also to the <HI>Fauni,</HI> they attributed Horns, and Horses Feet, to whom they sa∣crific'd a Goat; as likewise Milk to <HI>Sylvanus,</HI> God of their Forests; And in like manner, to <HI>Bacchus,</HI> the God of Wine; the Deform'd <HI>Priapus</HI> of the Gardens; <HI>Ce∣res,</HI> the Corn Deity, and <HI>Oreades,</HI> of the Mountains.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further description of <HI>Congoxuma.</HI></NOTE>But on the South side of the River, which flows thorow <HI>Congoxuma,</HI> the City spreads it self, running up against a high Mountain, and is hid, for the most part, behind the Rock, on which the Beacon stands. Then again, on the hang∣ing of a Hill, about the middle, in the South part of the City, stands a large Temple, whose Roof appears above all the Houses, exceeding costly within. The King of <HI>Saxuma</HI> going thither, was made, and receiv'd into the Orders of the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> so to save his Life, which he had forfeited, because he refus'd to pay Presents, and rebell'd against the Emperor. Moreover, in the East part of <HI>Con∣goxuma,</HI> near the foot of a Mountain, is the place of Execution, Inclos'd within a Stone Wall.</P>
<P>Whilst the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador staid to refresh himself here, being every where kindly entertain'd, he saw eleven <HI>Japanners,</HI> and three <HI>Portuguese,</HI> being <HI>Christians,</HI> Nail'd on Crosses, and Roasted by a gentle Fire.</P>
<P>Four Leagues from <HI>Coxenga,</HI> towards the North-West, appears a Mountain, whose top reaches above the Clouds, and is taken for the highest in the World, except the Mountain <HI>Tereyra,</HI> on the Island <HI>Tenariff,</HI> for it is a general Opinion, that that is nearest to the Heavens, and Vomits forth Fire and Brimstone above the Clouds.</P>
<PB N="470" REF="290"/>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador finding the Weather fairer, and the Wind grown calmer, proceeded on his Voyage, and past at last by the Vil∣lage <HI>Umbra,</HI> and in the like still Weather, reach'd <HI>Mongy,</HI> where he came to an Anchor: When soon after the Inhabitants came to him with all manner of Provision; from thence, Sailing between several small Isles, which in great abundance lie scatter'd before <HI>Dungo,</HI> he got so much ground, that against the. Evening he Sail'd into the Bay of <HI>Nanatzjamma:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zeldron</HI>'s further Jour∣ney.</NOTE> But now, his Voyage going on more slowly, the Ambassador Anchor'd on the eleventh day in the Haven of <HI>Cammenosacci;</HI> over against which lies an Island inhabited by a considerable number of Fishermen: Here the Seamen exchang'd Silk Peelings for Silver Flower-Pots of Wyer-Work, made so artificially, that no Countrey in the World can make the like; here they also got all manner of fresh Pro∣visions.</P>
<P>Not long staid the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador at <HI>Cammenosacci,</HI> but Weighing An∣chor in the Night, Sail'd between the small Islands <HI>Camro, Jore,</HI> and <HI>Szuwa,</HI> and Anchor'd near the Village <HI>Caroto,</HI> lying to the South of the main Coast of <HI>Japan.</HI> The Inhabitants of this place furnish'd them with exceeding good Locusts, which kind of Food was us'd above two thousand years ago amongst the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> and other Eastern People, and held in great esteem.</P>
<P><HI>Aelian</HI> relates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">l. 14. <HI>de Animal</HI> c. 13.</NOTE> That the <HI>Indian</HI> King had always a certain Dish of Worms, that grew in a Plant, and were Roasted.</P>
<P><HI>John Manardus</HI> relates, That in <HI>India</HI> he saw the like Stuff, mixt with Rice, which Food the Inhabitants love extreamly.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Mandevil</HI> saw three hundred years ago, the Princes on the Island <HI>Ta∣lache,</HI> making good Cheer with Wood Worms.</P>
<P>This kind of Food also was accounted a great Dainty amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">l. 17. c. 19.</NOTE> and chiefly those Worms that grew in Oaken-Trees, which being taken, and brought up with Meal, were accounted a very choice Dish.</P>
<P>Moreover, The Souldiers which went with the Emperor, <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, from <HI>Ferrara</HI> to <HI>Tunis,</HI> (as <HI>Brasavolus</HI> relates) observ'd, that the <HI>Africans</HI> liv'd on raw Locusts.</P>
<P>Besides the Locusts, the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador got for his Retinue, a Cow, which was kill'd in the Village <HI>Caroto,</HI> and some Goats, which thereabouts are taken in abundance. Thus refresh'd, he Sail'd about the Islands <HI>Caminagari,</HI> and <HI>Jocosima,</HI> to <HI>Tantonomi,</HI> a Village full of fair Buildings, and Populous, lying on a Promontory of the Main Coast of <HI>Japan;</HI> where they Ferry over to <HI>Tonsa,</HI> and where one of the Emperors Custom-Houses stands, which brings in above forty thousand <HI>Rials</HI> of Silver yearly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the City <HI>Mewarry.</HI></NOTE>¶ THe Ambassador hasting his Voyage, reach'd the high Point of <HI>Mewar∣ry,</HI> where he was quite becalm'd; four Sea-men and a <HI>Japan</HI> Inter∣preter had leave to go a Shore here, where they found a City built on Hilly Ground, round about which lay many pleasant Meadows that abound with Corn and Rice, but chiefly with Plum-Trees, the Fruit whereof Preserv'd, were sent all over <HI>Japan,</HI> to use in their Drink, <HI>Tee,</HI> and <HI>Tzia.</HI> The Citizens of <HI>Mewarry</HI> look'd very strange upon the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> having seldom or never seen any of them before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Japanners</HI> Opinion of the deceased Souls.</NOTE>Some of his Retinue desir'd of the <HI>Japan</HI> Interpreter to see some of the Tem∣ples in <HI>Mewarry,</HI> which were sixteen in number, but it was not a convenient time,
<PB N="471" REF="290"/>because the Inhabitants there that day kept a Festival, for the departed Souls. The whole City was in a Hurry, every one was in his best Apparel, carrying his Idol out of the City, to the Graves of their nearest Relations; where the Idol being set down, both young and old fell on their Faces to Worship it, and Pray'd very earnestly, that <HI>Amida, Xaca, Canon,</HI> or any other god (for every one serves whom he list) would be pleas'd to shew Mercy to the Souls of their De∣ceas'd Friends, that they might not be tortur'd with those that dy'd wickedly, in the boyling Waters of <HI>Singok,</HI> but that they might be carry'd, and remain in the place of Everlasting Happiness. Moreover, they believe, that the Souls of the Deceas'd, for some years, wander up and down about their Graves.</P>
<P>This Office of Sacrificing and Praying for the Dead, is generally perform'd by the young Men out of the City; and when they have done, every one takes up his Idol, and go one after another into the City, after the manner of a Pro∣cession: But in their return, they talk to themselves, as if they had a Soul that walk'd with them, with which they hold a very serious Discourse. And thus they continue till they come to their Houses, where they prepare all manner of Dainties for the Soul; some place the Dishes with Meat under their Pent-Houses, others upon the Roof, where they let it stand about half an hour, then fetching it in, and setting it up very safe, the young Men run Hooting and Hollowing out of the City, striking in the Air with Boughs of Trees, so (as they say) to drive the Souls of the Deceas'd back again to their Graves: Then taking Breath, they return home, where they spend the whole Night in all manner of Lasciviousness: But this Ceremony which they use to the Souls, are observ'd several ways in <HI>Japan,</HI> for in other places (as we have at large de∣scrib'd before) they throw Stones against, and on the top of the Houses, so to drive the Souls back to their Graves.</P>
<P>Furthermore, The King of the Province <HI>Mewarry</HI> keeps a brave Court in this City: Next to which is a <HI>Seraglio,</HI> wherein, a considerable number of Ladies are kept for his Concubines. Against the Evening, the four <HI>Hollanders</HI> and the Interpreter being Aboard again, they made Sail, and Steer'd between several Isles to <HI>Binga,</HI> a fair City, which appears with several Turrets and high Tem∣ples: Against the Evening, they Stem'd with the Island <HI>Sinoja,</HI> and in the Morn∣ing had sight of <HI>Fibi,</HI> when a stiff Gale out of the North drove them more to the South-ward; so that soon after they came near <HI>Margan</HI> Rocks, which rise very high out of the Sea; on the highest of them lies a curious neat Town; below which the Rock is very artificially hewn out, for a convenient Haven against all Winds whatsoever: Here the Ambassador drop'd Anchor, and when grown somewhat calmer, stood out again, but could not reach beyond <HI>Fibi,</HI> how∣ever, at Night he got to <HI>Dasacci;</HI> and although the Storm began to blow afresh, yet next day he got to <HI>Ousimata,</HI> from whence he Sail'd over to <HI>Wota,</HI> where he lay at an Anchor all Night, and in the Morning Weighing, got to the Banks before <HI>Muro,</HI> where he ran a ground, the Barque giving a great blow, and had without doubt burst asunder, had not the Wind blown off from the Shore, so that ha∣ling out all their Sails, they at last got off, and afterwards judg'd it convenient to fall down to the Island <HI>Jesima,</HI> so to get into a deeper Water. On <HI>Jesima,</HI> as also on all the other little Islands, stood a Beacon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beacons.</NOTE> built four and twenty years before, upon an occasion (which the <HI>Japan</HI> Interpreter related) being at the time when the Islands of <HI>Bungo</HI> and <HI>Saykok</HI> rebell'd against the Emperor, and made the Water between <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>Tonsa</HI> very dangerous by their Piracy; wherefore the Islanders, so soon as ever they descry'd any Ships from their Beacons,
<PB N="472" REF="291"/>gave notice thereof to the Main-Land, by fireing them in the Night, or making a great Smoke in the day time; whereupon they immediately Guar∣ded the Sea-Shore, and sent off several Vessels well Man'd; since which time they observ'd the same Custom with their Beacons, either in bad Weather, or when any one endeavors to make his escape, that hath by some means or other incur'd the Emperors displeasure. On which occasions a certain sign is given, so that he who thought to save himself by flight, seldom es∣capes, notwithstanding he suddenly gets into some Haven or other; for the Water between <HI>Bungo, Tonsa,</HI> and the Main-Coast of <HI>Japan,</HI> from <HI>Simonisac∣ci</HI> to <HI>Osacca,</HI> is full of little Islands, on every one of which stands a Bea∣con, Guarded and continually Watch'd by two Men, that have three Shil∣lings a day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pleasant Scituation of <HI>Swoja,</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador, after he left <HI>Jesima,</HI> Steer'd his Course Easterly, and drop'd Anchor in the Haven which washes <HI>Swoja;</HI> where going Ashore, he found the Countrey thereabouts so exceeding pleasant, that the whole Earth cannot shew a finer spot of Ground. How much have the <HI>Romans</HI> cry'd up the Countrey about <HI>Capua,</HI> which yields Fruit twice a year, where there is a disputable difference, whether the Ground be Fruitfuller that produces Corn or Vines? The <HI>Greeks</HI> also spent much time in describing the famous <HI>Tempe</HI> in <HI>Thes∣salie:</HI> But certainly both <HI>Tempe</HI> and <HI>Campania,</HI> may not be compar'd to the plea∣santness of <HI>Swoja,</HI> which is on the South Wash'd by the Ocean, that makes a con∣venient Harbor, having against Northern Storms a high Shore; against Eastern, the Promontory of <HI>Saccai;</HI> and against Western, the mighty Island <HI>Tonsa;</HI> and the high Rocks on the South-Shore break the violence of the Waves, when at any time a South Wind blows the Billows against the Shore. Moreover, round about the City, the Countrey is exceeding delightful, because of the several Growths with which it is adorn'd. In some places the Ground being Hilly, is Crown'd with shady Trees; in others the Valleys abound with all manner of Plants; there are Plow'd Fields; here pleasant Meadows full of Oxen and Sheep. The City <HI>Swoja</HI> it self, very curiously built, hath many great Store∣houses, in which the Merchandize from all places are laid, to be transported thence to <HI>Osacca, Saccai, Miaco,</HI> and other places of Trade. The Ambassador <HI>Zelderen</HI> unladed some Hart and Buck Skins here, whilst the Sea-men went to see the Neighboring Town <HI>Akas,</HI> because the Citizens of <HI>Swoja</HI> related a strange Story of an accident, which for the most part ruin'd that Town. And indeed, when they came thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruine of the Town <HI>Akas.</HI></NOTE> they found above half of <HI>Akas</HI> lying desolate, some Houses being faln in, others sunk into the Ground, yet others appear'd with some part of them lying on the Earth, but the other part stood in a pretty good condition. The Inhabitants whereof told them, That not long since, a terrible Earthquake shook the Earth two days together, then the Flames broke forth betwixt the crack'd Earth, as if it would have devour'd all things; and lastly, there arose such a Fog, that choak'd many.</P>
<P>Not far from this, lies a Sulphurous burning Mountain, whose Subterranean Fire having consum'd the Earth, at last broke forth. The Emperor <HI>Toxogunsa∣ma</HI> allow'd them some of his Revenues, to Re-build that part of the Town which was so harras'd.</P>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador leaving the Haven of <HI>Swoja,</HI> Sail'd within a Musquet Shot of <HI>Fiungo,</HI> then ply'd up to reach <HI>Sacca,</HI> but the Wind blowing hard out of the North-East, he was driven back to <HI>Avans,</HI> where he

This is not onely a handsome, but an antient City, surrounded with a strong Wall.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japan</HI> Emperor hath in all his Fortifications plac'd Overseers, whose Offices are to look after the repairing of the Walls, and putting in new Stones so soon as they see any one begin to decay: Whilst they Rode here at Anchor, the Ambassador <HI>Zelderen</HI> saw a <HI>Japanner,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanner</HI> drowns him∣self.</NOTE> who having great Stones ty'd about his Neck, Legs, and Middle, leaping into the Water, drown'd himself for the honor of <HI>Canon.</HI> The Vessel in which he was brought from the Shore, was immediately burnt, being too Holy to be us'd thereafter for any Worldly Affairs.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of <HI>Meaco.</HI></NOTE>¶ The first Gate of the City <HI>Meaco,</HI> hath three Entrances, whereof the mid∣dlemost is the biggest, built between a Free-Stone-Wall; the inner Gate is one Story high, from whose Roof Stream'd a Flag with the Citie-Arms. <HI>Miaco,</HI> by the <HI>Japanners</HI> also call'd <HI>Cabucoma,</HI> and <HI>Cocquay,</HI> contain'd for∣merly in its Circumference one and twenty Miles, but is since, by the Civil Wars, become above a third part less, yet at this day it reckons above eighty thousand Families, divided into the upper and lower City; the lower spreads it self to <HI>Fissima,</HI> and is so costly built, that one Edifice seems to be above a Mile long. In the upper <HI>Miaco,</HI> the <HI>Dayro</HI> with his Cungies (that is, Counsellors) keeps a stately Court; himself looks like a Savage, being never Shav'd, nor his Nails par'd; besides, five Eminent Colledges in the City, there are five Free-Schools more about <HI>Miaco,</HI> viz. <HI>Coja, Wegru, Franzon, Homi,</HI> and <HI>Bandu,</HI> every one of which hath above three thousand five hundred Scholars, which are there taught the Arts of Rhetorick, Oratory, Histonography, Astronomy, Poetry, and Arithmetick.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Tree.</NOTE>Here grow Palm Trees, of whose Juyce the <HI>Japanners</HI> make an excellent Drink; the Root digg'd up and dry'd in the Sun, then Planted again, in a short time will grow to be another Tree.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Miaco,</HI> the Mountain <HI>Frenojamma</HI> riseth with its spiring top to∣wards the Clouds.</P>
<P><HI>Peter Davity</HI> tells us of a very strange Mountain, seen in the Kingdom <HI>Jetchu,</HI> which Flames continually.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Graves in <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE>Moreover, here as in most places of <HI>Japan</HI> are several Tombs or Graves, rais'd of Free-Stone, about two Foot high, in which being hollow, the Friends to the Deceas'd often times lay Water and raw Rice, which the poor People or Birds fetch from thence. They also strow the Graves with Flowers, and Boughs of Trees.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Taicosama</HI>'s Court.</NOTE>¶ VEry admirable is the Palace which <HI>Taicosama</HI> built in <HI>Miaco,</HI> in which hang a thousand Pieces of Tapistry, Embroyder'd with Gold ; just before the Palace is a spacious open Court, in the middle of which stands a Theatre, where they Act both Tragedies and Comedies; on every side there∣of stand four Turrets, each four Stories high: The Houses and Apartments are for the most part built of Wood, yet handsome to behold. They seldom Build of Stone, because the Earthquakes are so frequent in <HI>Japan,</HI> and though often times whole Villages, nay, Cities are burnt down, yet they all Build again of Timber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wood in <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE> wherewith the Woods furnish them plentifully; for they not onely produce ordinary Timber, but also White Wood, not unlike that, of which in <HI>Europe</HI> we make Virginals; besides all manner of Fruit-Trees, and tall Cedars, whose lofty Crowns seem to salute the Skies: The Cedars are us'd most for Pillars, and Masts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japanners</HI> have strange Orders when a Fire happens in the Night, for the Street in which the Fire is, must help themselves, for none else will
<PB N="475" REF="294"/>come near to assist them; by which means, many times the Fire gets such a head, that the Flame consumes all before it.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Meaco,</HI> as in most other places of <HI>Japan,</HI> they drive a great Trade, in far better order than in any part of <HI>Europe;</HI> for it is no small help or benefit, that all the <HI>Japan</HI> Lordships, Dukedoms, and Provinces have one Mea∣sure, both for wet and dry Goods. Their Measure, call'd <HI>Ichin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Measure.</NOTE> is six <HI>Rhyneland</HI> Feet long, divided into six greater, and sixty lesser parts, of else every Foot in∣to ten Inches: From this <HI>Ichin</HI> they make their Ell call'd <HI>Issiack,</HI> which is ex∣actly the sixth part of the <HI>Ichin;</HI> but the <HI>Issiack</HI> hath also ten great, and sixty lesser parts; the tenths are call'd <HI>Isson;</HI> ten <HI>Issons</HI> make an <HI>Itsiebou,</HI> and six <HI>Itsie∣bous</HI> one <HI>Ichin;</HI> which Measure all Shop-keepers use, and is so exact, that it differs not a Hairs breadth.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Coyn very strange.</NOTE>The same order they observe with their Coyn. The Mint-Master coyns no Money, either of Copper, Silver, or Gold, but every Merchant goes to the Farmers of the Metal-Mines, of whom he buyes the gross Silver and Gold as cheap as he can, then makes it of an exact weight, according to the Emperors Order; then he delivers the Pieces to the Emperors Officers of the Mint, which meet on certain days, to weigh the Money which is brought in to them; whether it be full weight; and if it wants but half a Grain, they cut it in the middle, and so return it to the Owner: Those that are weight, the Officers mark with their Stamp; which done, it must be tried and weigh'd twice more; for although they shew the Stamp, that the Money wants nothing in weight, yet it is not passable: Wherefore the Merchant delivers it to Officers appointed for that purpose, to try whether it be not mix'd, but true Metal, who when they find but the lead mixture in it, they also cut it to pieces, and give it again to the Owners; but if it endures the proof, it is carried to the Masters of the Mint, who then weighing it again, Coyn it; which done, it may be paid away; for if any way it should chance to be too light, it may neither be receiv'd nor paid by any, on forfeiture of all their Estates.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange way of Trading in <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE>Moreover, their paying of Money is very strange; for the <HI>Japanners</HI> having great store of Gold and Silver, observe a Custom to receive their Money without telling or seeing it. The Mint-Master puts the Gold in Papers, which contain the value of two hundred Pound <HI>Sterling;</HI> these seal'd up, pass from one to another without being question'd. They also use little Wooden Boxes, in which they put twenty seal'd Papers of Gold, which is as much as a Man can handsomly carry; every Box amounts to four thousand pound <HI>Sterling:</HI> And the like Boxes, but of another fashion, they use for their Silver, in every one of which lies twelve hundred Crowns, and is seal'd with the Coyners Seal: But doth it not seem strange, that never any deceit is found in that blind Way of paying of Money?</P>
<PB N="476" REF="295"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Gold and Silver Coyn.</NOTE>Furthermore, the <HI>Japanners</HI> have but three sorts of Gold Coyn; the biggest Piece whereof is worth sixty Crowns; the second, eight; the third, two. The Silver, though weigh'd and coyn'd, is of no certain value; for the Coyn∣ers put it together into little Packs worth sixty Crowns. Their Copper Coyn hath a square Hole in the middle, through which a String being put, and several of them tied together, pass for ordinary things amongst the Com∣mon People.</P>
<P>In the uppermost Eastern Parts of <HI>Japan,</HI> no Coyn passes for Merchan∣dize but Gold; yet at <HI>Nangesaque,</HI> amongst the Foreign Traders, they tender their Payments for the most part in Silver, because they may not carry any Gold out of the Countrey, being contrary to the Emperors Order: Where∣fore the Emperor, amongst other Reasons, took a great dislike against the <HI>Por∣tuguese,</HI> because they transported several Tun of Gold out of his Dominions.</P>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador leaving <HI>Meaco,</HI> travell'd along the Foot of the Mountain <HI>Frenojama,</HI> through <HI>Oets,</HI> to <HI>Jesi,</HI> lying at a Lake about eighteen Leagues long, out of which the River that flows through <HI>Meaco</HI> and <HI>Osacca</HI> into the Sea, hath its Original. <HI>Zelderen</HI> being desir'd in <HI>Jesi</HI> to see the pleasant Mountain <HI>Pauromama,</HI> lying near the said Lake, East-North-East from <HI>Jesi,</HI> durst not deny the Invitation; but was carried thither in a stately Barge, with two Masts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japan</HI> Barque.</NOTE> each with a square Sail: When the Wind fail'd them, the <HI>Japanners</HI> row'd with broad-leav'd Oars: On her Bowe hung two Anchors: In the middle of the Barque was a square Seat, resting on four Posts, through which the Main-Mast went. the sides of the Seat were adorn'd with gilded Imagery; on the top of it the <HI>Japan</HI> Sea-men handed their Main-Sail; under it sate the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador, bare-headed, attended on each side by <HI>Japan∣ners,</HI> holding a Fan in their Hands. Before the Barque row'd a <HI>Japan</HI> Boat, in which the Ambassadors Men play'd on their Trumpets. In few Hours they got together to the Mountain <HI>Pauromama,</HI> where they found several Barques, with long Pennons streaming from their Masts, riding at Anchor. At the Foot of the Mountain, on the Shore, stands a fair Portal, on both sides sup∣ported with square Pillars; the Gates thereof open in the middle: A Wall of great Free-stone runs near the Water-side, for a Defence to the Governors House, a very stately Building, though it is not seen afar off, because hid be∣hind some part of the Mountain. Near this House are several others, inhabi∣ted by Gentlemen, and other meaner People, all inclos'd in the foremention'd Wall.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Moun∣tain <HI>Pauromama.</HI></NOTE>The Mountain it self is very steep, and of a great height; but hath many Juttings out, along which, winding Stairs lead to the top, where stands a Temple inhabited by the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> which having three Roofs, seems to be but small, because it stands an exceeding height, from whence several <HI>Japan</HI> Towns and Cities may be seen, as namely, <HI>Itzibe, Minacutz, Zintzsamma, Cusatz, Ta∣monizu, Jesi, Oets, Meaco, Fissima, Jonda, Firaskatta; Uchats, Vinari, Micava,</HI> and many other Places. Half way between this Temple and the Governors House, stands the Residence for the Emperors Soldiers, built on a Promontory, being several Houses. On the right side, in the hanging of the Mountain, the Go∣vernor hath a curious Garden, the Trees whereof being planted one above another, seem to see themselves in the Lake. In the middle of the Garden stands a stately Banquetting-house: On the left side, where the Mountain runs sloaping into the Lake, stood four Huts, inhabited by Rusticks. More∣over,

It is scarce to be credited how the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Poets tired themselves in describing this <HI>Tempe:</HI> Yet notwithstanding all, it falls much short of the Pleasantness of the Mountain <HI>Pauromama.</HI></P>
<P>The Ambassador <HI>Zelderen's</HI> Gentleman-Usher took an exact Draught of the Mountain, from the Barge which was made fast to the Governors Water-gate; and having just finish'd it, the Lord <HI>Basuro Micondono,</HI> which came with <HI>Zelde∣ren</HI> from <HI>Jesi</HI> to <HI>Pauromama,</HI> came walking towards him, and spent a considera∣ble time in viewing of the Draught.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Generousness of the <HI>Ja∣panners.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador was most sumptuously entertain'd, after the <HI>Japan</HI> manner; for the People in this part of the Countrey are exceeding generous, the Children themselves being ambitious of nothing so much as getting a good Name, and striving to out-do one another in Courtesies. No <HI>Japanner</HI> fears any danger where he is belov'd. It is very seldom that a Man of any Repute will curse his Enemies, because he rather chuses to revenge his Cause with the Sword than Tongue. When any one desires another to be his Se∣cond in an unequal Match, they never refuse it, though it cost both Life and Fortune.</P>
<P>¶ SOon after <HI>Zelderen</HI> proceeded in his Journey to <HI>Jedo,</HI> which was very pleasant, and seem'd the shorter for the remarkable Stories which the <HI>Japan</HI> Interpreter now and then related concerning it: Amongst others, he told them, <Q>That some years since he saw the Temple of the Idol <HI>Topan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Idol <HI>Topan.</HI></NOTE> whose Image stood on a Copper Altar cast like Clouds; himself Arm'd like a Warrier, a Coronet Helmet on his Head, his Hand grasping a mighty Club, so seeming to fly through the Sky, and moving his Club to occasion Thun∣der. When it thunder'd, a <HI>Bonzi</HI> whose Head was adorn'd with Consecra∣ted Leaves, which no Thunder could harm, offer'd several Fishes.</Q></P>
<P>To this Relation, the Interpreter added a second, not without many Cir∣cumstances:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Relation of the Idol <HI>Fotoques.</HI></NOTE> <Q>Not many Years ago (said he) the Island <HI>Bungo</HI> lay joyn'd to the Main Coast of <HI>Japan,</HI> so that the People could go afoot from <HI>Cokero</HI> to <HI>Simonisicci;</HI> when it chanc'd, that some Thieves had stoln the Golden Image in the Night from the Temple of <HI>Fotoques,</HI> at which <HI>Fotoques</HI> was exceeding∣ly enrag'd. The Thieves living about <HI>Cokero,</HI> hid the Image in their Caves, so that the Malefactors were not known: But <HI>Fotoques</HI> taking it as a great disgrace, and very hainously, rent <HI>Bungo</HI> from the main Coast of <HI>Japan,</HI> and swallow'd up a whole Tract of Land, so that the Sea between <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>Tonsa</HI> ever since was united with the <HI>Corean</HI> Ocean. In the interim, he took great care of his Image; for he caus'd it, though of pure Gold, to swim like Wood, and carried it through the Sea to the Island <HI>Mettogamona,</HI> where driving ashore, it was taken up and put in a Temple, and is there to this day Religiously worshipp'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Not far from <HI>Mettogamma</HI> (said the Interpreter) lies an exceeding high Mountain, opposite to the Island <HI>Moeko,</HI> on the top of which stand several
<PB N="478" REF="298"/>Temples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wonderful Opinion of the <HI>Japanners</HI> concerning the Creation.</NOTE> which may be seen a great distance off at Sea: In these Temples the <HI>Bonzies</HI> worshipp'd that great God, which formerly not onely Created the Sun, Moon, and Stars, but also the fifteen lesser Deities which some Ages since convers'd upon the Earth. The Prime God commanded the Substitute Gods that they should make a Brazen Egg, in which they were to enclose the four Elements, Water, Earth, Air, and Fire, and also the four principal Colours, Red, Yellow, Blue, and Green. Out of this Egg the four Ele∣ments and Colours being tempred ran together, in such a nature, that the visible World appear'd. The World thus created, Man was wanting: Not long after, a Woman growing in the Shell of a <HI>Callabash,</HI> had no Soul, which the Chief God pittying, made a Stier come to the <HI>Callabash,</HI> who through his Nostrils blew Breath into the <HI>Callabash,</HI> which came to be a Soul in the grow∣ing Woman; who then coming forth, was familiar with the inferior Deities, by which means Mankind not onely increas'd in number, but also in wick∣edness, differing more and more from their Heavenly Extract, growing still worse and worse, mocking at Thunder, Rainbowes, and Fire; nay, they blasphem'd the great God himself (whom when the Interpreter nam'd, he bow'd his Head to the Ground) whereupon he call'd his inferior Deities about him, telling them, That he resolv'd to destroy and ruine all things, kick the Sun, Moon, and Stars out of the Firmament, mix the Air and Wa∣ter together, and make a round Globe, in which the four Elements should be all resolv'd into their former Mass: And chiefly he commanded the Idol <HI>Topan</HI> to make Thunderballs to shoot through the Air, and fire all the King∣doms with Lightning; which was no sooner said, but it was done, the whole World on a sudden lying together like a heap of Rubbish, so that none were saved, except one Man and his Family, that had entertain'd and duely worshipp'd the Gods. The Chief and Supreme Deity. took care in this general Ruine for the innocent Man, locking him in a deep Cave, be∣fore which he put a great Shell, that the Water might not run into the Pit or Cave.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Japanners</HI> acknowledge the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> and the Hood.</NOTE>Who doth not observe by this Discourse, that the remotest <HI>Heathens</HI> acknow∣ledge, though darkly, the fall of <HI>Adam</HI> and the Flood, in which <HI>Noah</HI> and his nearest.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Holland</HI> Ambassadors re∣ception at <HI>Mia.</HI></NOTE>¶ MEan while the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador proceeded forward on his Jour∣hey, and Ferried over from <HI>Quano</HI> to <HI>Mia;</HI> where he had no sooner landed the Emperors Presents, but the Governor of <HI>Mia,</HI> with a considerable Train of People, came out of the City to receive and conduct him. Just without the Gate several Copper Basons were hung on cross Poles, on which the <HI>Japanners</HI> tabering, made a great noise. Moreover, several <HI>Norimons</HI> or Se∣dans were carried towards the Water-side, every one guarded with a conside∣rable number of Soldiers. At the foot of a high Rock stood the Ambassadors four Trumpets, each of them sounding a <HI>Levit.</HI> The Governor <HI>Obirham Gian∣todono</HI> had no sooner gotten sight of the Ambassador, but stepping out of his Sedan, he went to meet him, and bow'd himfelf after the <HI>Japan</HI> manner to the Ground. Behind stood some of the Guard with Musquets, others with Pikes and Halberds.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Ambassador going from hence, soon after arriv'd at <HI>Jedo,</HI> where having staid some time, and dispatch'd his Business, he had leave to go for <HI>Nangesaque</HI> again.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of a Whale.</NOTE>¶ NEar <HI>Firando</HI> he found the Whale-Fishers, which go yearly to <HI>Corea</HI> to catch Whales. The bigness of these Sea-monsters is to be most ad∣mir'd; their Pizzles being generally fourteen Foot long, which they hide in their Bellies: When they couple, they rage with Lust, holding their Bellies together, and embracing one another with their Fins, above an Hour at a time; after which, according to <HI>Julius Caesar Scaliger,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dist. c. <HI>13.</HI> sect. <HI>150</HI></NOTE> they bear their Young ten Months.</P>
<P>The ordinary Whales are commonly a hundred and twenty Foot long, and their Heads are the third part of their Body: On their Noses are two round Holes, at which they suck in abundance of Water, and spout it out again an exceeding height: Their Eyes are three Yards long, and a Foot and a half broad: Their Ears, with which they hear any small noise, are less without than within; they open their Mouths five Fathom wide; their Tongue, eighteen Foot long, and ten broad, rests on eight hundred Supporters full of downy Hair. The Whale-catchers seldom find any thing in their ripp'd-up Bowels, more than some handfuls of Sea-Spiders and Weeds, though it is known that they feed on Fish; for a Whale hath been taken that hath had forty
<PB N="480" REF="301"/>Cods in his Belly. It may with reason be believ'd, that since the Passage of their Throats is but narrow, they chew all that they eat. The Females bear their Youg till grown to the bigness of a Cow, which continually keeps under its Dams Fins, and forsakes her not till she Spawns. Although they give Suck, they have no outward Teats or Dugs; for they are plac'd near the Womb, and so full of Milk, that (as <HI>Francis Rondeletius</HI> relates to have seen on the Coast of <HI>Acquitain</HI>) great Wine-Vessels were fill'd with it, suck'd from a stranded Female Whale.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is very strange to observe the great Inclination between a Whale, and a little Fish call'd a <HI>Trusch,</HI> which swims continually before it, whose Eyes, by reason of his great Eye-lids, often dazel, and gives him notice when he is too near a Shelf or Rock:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. <HI>2.</HI> in Eutropium.</NOTE> Of which <HI>Claudian</HI> the <HI>Latin</HI> Poet saith thus;</P>
<Q><L><HI>Thus would the Whale run against Rocks and Sands,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But that his Guide such Prejudice withstands,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Leading the Monster through the Surging Sea,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And with his Tail shewing a ready Way.</HI></L></Q>
<P>But whereas the Fish call'd <HI>Trusch</HI> bears a great Inclination towards the Whale; so on the contrary, the <HI>Tonny,</HI> and <HI>Dolphin,</HI> but especially the <HI>Sword∣fish,</HI> have a general Animosity against him; for the <HI>Sword-fish</HI> getting under him, rents up his Belly, and creeping in, eats out his Tongue; from whence it comes, that dead Whales are oftentimes found floating without a Tongue. <HI>Pliny</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 3. cap. 34.</NOTE> That these Monsters do not only sleep in the Night, but seem as if they were dead, lying with their Heads out of the Water to breathe. It is very remarkable to observe the Natural Affection which the Males have for the Females, which was generally taken notice of, when <HI>Anno</HI> 1577. fourteen of them came before the Village <HI>Terheide</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> of which one being a Fe∣male, hapning to get fast on the Shore, the Male with great force threw abun∣dance of Water to her, so if possible to get her afloat; but all being in vain, she sticking too fast in the Sands, he also swam towards her, where they were both kill'd and taken by the Fishermen. No less is the Inclination which the Dam hath for her Young; for when it is in danger of running against Rocks or Shelves, she catches it up in her Mouth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Whale-fishing at <HI>Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gesaque.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Japanners</HI> that inhabit <HI>Firando,</HI> catch the Whales near <HI>Corea,</HI> same manner as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> take them before <HI>Greenland,</HI> and <HI>Spitsbergen:</HI> So soon as they discover them, they go thither in small Boats, carrying Harping-Irons with them; which being full of retorted Hooks, they strike the Whale in the sides of the Head: At the end of the Harping-Iron is a Line two hundred Fathom long. The Fish thus wounded, immediately bounces towards the Ground; whereupon they give him still more and more Line. If the Line should chance to be foul of any thing, it would certainly over-set the Boat. At the end of the Rope hangs a Barrel, which driving on the top they follow; but it oftentimes happens, that the Whale sinking too deep, hides both Line and Barrel. At other times he lies rolling on the Ground, or comes driving dead up again: If he chanceth to be yet living, they pierce his Sides with Lances, which the Whale feeling, makes so great a bustle, that the Seamen run no small hazard of losing their Lives.

<P>¶ BUt <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador passing by <HI>Meaco,</HI> soon after arriv'd at <HI>Nan∣gesaque,</HI> where he kept the usual Day of Sale, which was publish'd by setting up of Bills, that all the Merchandize was to be sold on the Island <HI>Disma</HI> in <HI>Nangesaque;</HI> which they proclaim'd by tabering on large Copper Ba∣sons: Whereupon the Merchants consulting together, every one wrote in roll'd up Papers at what Prices he would have the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Commodities; the one not knowing what Rate the other hath set down, the <HI>Bonjoises,</HI> to which the Notes are deliver'd, open them; and those that they find to bid most, receive the Goods; after which the Payment immediately follows, ei∣ther in Boats of Silver, or seal'd Papers of Coyn'd Silver; which Payments are so just, that there is not the least fraud in any of them; for if it should be found out, the Trader would not onely lose his Life, but also his whole Fami∣ly, and twenty of his Neighbors, five on each side of his House, and ten of those that liv'd opposite against him.</P>
<P>For the Landing and Shipping of the Goods, a considerable Number of La∣borers are constantly employ'd, which all come before the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Store∣house on <HI>Disma,</HI> where the <HI>Bonjois</HI> throws as many Pieces of Wood, mark'd with the <HI>East-India</HI> Companies Arms, out of the Window, as there are occasi∣on for Laborers. It is pleasant to behold how the Multitude scrambles, every one endeavoring to get a piece of Wood; Boxing, Wrastling, and all other Robustious Exercises, being free at that time. He that gets one of these Pie∣ces, sticks it at his Girdle, which being shew'd to the <HI>Bonjoises,</HI> he hath order to work at a set Price.</P>

<P>At the time when <HI>Alphonsus Albuquerque</HI> re-took the famous City <HI>Goa</HI> for <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> the <HI>Arabian Mamud</HI> King of <HI>Malacca</HI> had contrary to his Oath set upon some <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and kept them close Prisoners: But <HI>Albuquerque</HI> hasting to <HI>Malacca</HI> to release them, met in his way with a <HI>Malacca</HI> General call'd <HI>Naodabeguca,</HI> who setting upon them, bought his Death dearly, falling down at last with a hundred gaping Wounds on the Ground: It occa∣sion'd no small wonder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Wonder of a wounded <HI>Malaccan.</HI></NOTE> that not one of them bled a drop; but so soon as a Golden Armlet was taken from him, the Blood gush'd forth from all parts in great abundance, so that <HI>Naodabeguca</HI> instantly gave up the Ghost.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Wedding-house.</NOTE>¶ <HI>MAmud</HI>'s Daughter marrying to the Prince of the <HI>Panenses,</HI> kept her Wedding in <HI>Malacca:</HI> The Nuptial Ceremonies were perform'd in great State: A great House, or moving Castle, built on thirty Wheels, and hung with rich Tapestry, was by Elephants drawn through the City; within stood the Tables cover'd, and the Guests, sung, danced, and acted all manner of pleasant Pastime.</P>
<P>Whilst thus <HI>Malacca</HI> was in the height of its pleasure, <HI>Albuquerque</HI> brought his Fleet into the Harbor, and demanded the delivery of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Priso∣ners, which <HI>Mamud</HI> out of fear deliver'd him; yet the <HI>Portuguese</HI> set the City on Fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Malacca</HI> on Fire.</NOTE> and not thus satisfied, <HI>Albuquerque</HI> would have a place in the City to build a Castle, that they might drive their Trade without fear: Moreover, he demanded the Damage and Charges which the Fleet had cost preparing, be∣cause it was done purposely for this Expedition. The Kings Son, and Son-in-Law, cry'd out, They would venture the utmost of it, which though the Event prov'd never so bad, could not be worse than the insufferable high Am∣bition of the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> Thus the two young Princes perswaded <HI>Mamud</HI> to take up Arms, who otherwise would have bought Peace, though on unequal Terms. Whereupon with speed raising some Fortifications, but chiefly guarding the Bridge that went over the River with Men and Arms, he carried out his Elephants with Towers full of Soldiers, to hinder the Landing of the <HI>Portu∣guese;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Valiant Fight.</NOTE> yet they, notwithstanding all his resistance, Landed, <HI>John Lima</HI> march∣ing directly on towards the smallest part of the City, where the Kings Palace stood, and also a <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Temple, but hapned to fall in amongst <HI>Mamud</HI>'s Son <HI>Alodyn</HI>'s Soldiers, which occasion'd a fierce Battel for a considerable time, when <HI>Mamud</HI> himself came with his Elephants on the Backs of the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> wherefore <HI>Lima</HI> facing about with a part of his Men, broke their Ranks, and wounded their Elephants, who returning amongst their own Army, made such a Rout, that they tumbled one over another, every one then seeking which way to fly. <HI>Mamud</HI> being cruelly wounded, sav'd himself by flight: <HI>Alodyn</HI> also began to give ground.</P>
<P>But <HI>Albuquerque</HI> found so great Resistance at the Bridge, that he sounded a Retreat; yet a few days after he renew'd the Fight, when it fortun'd much better; for although <HI>Mamud</HI> had undermin'd the Streets, so to blow up the

<P>But <HI>Albuquerque</HI> ran great danger; for the <HI>Malaccans</HI> keeping close together in their narrow Streets, made fierce resistance; the Women and Children throwing Stones, and other combustible things, out of their Windows; yet at last he forc'd them to fly, raising a Bulwark at each end of the conquer'd Bridge, and cover'd the same over on the top with Sails, to keep off the Heat of the Sun.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matelief</HI>'s Voyage.</NOTE>¶ AFter this, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> liv'd here undisturb'd, till <HI>Cornelius Matelief,</HI> sail∣ing from the <HI>Texel, Anno</HI> 1605. with eleven Ships, Mann'd with thir∣teen hundred fifty seven Men, fetch'd four great Ships out of the Haven of <HI>Ma∣lacca,</HI> rais'd a Platform on <HI>Pulo Malacca,</HI> and landed seven hundred Men, which made the <HI>Portuguese</HI> retreat to their Suburbs, fortified with a strong Wall; and out of their Suburbs, which were set on fire, into the City.</P>
<P><HI>Malacca</HI> it self the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had so fortified with wide Trenches, strong Forts, Gates, and Towers, that it would easily endure a great Siege: <HI>John de Patuan</HI> King of <HI>Jor,</HI> brought some Assistance to them; but those Countrey People were neither fit to work, for laziness; nor to fight, for fainthearted∣ness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Malacca</HI> besieg'd.</NOTE>In the interim <HI>Matelief</HI> rais'd another Platform, against the corner of the City-Trench, from which he fired continually. In the City died daily above forty People, of Hunger and noysom Smells: But the Besiegers also suffer'd almost as great Inconveniences, not only a great Sickness hapning among them, but being lodg'd under the open Canopy of Heaven, were miserably stung by the Wasps, so that continual waking had quite tired them; yet they took fresh Courage, when two Ships came from <HI>Holland,</HI> with two hundred forty five Men, to their Assistance: But soon after the little <HI>Sung</HI> Frigat discover'd the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Fleet sent to relieve <HI>Malacca.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fight between the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Portuguese.</HI></NOTE><HI>Matelief</HI> being inform'd thereof, fetch'd his Guns from the Platforms aboard, brake up the Siege, and prepar'd himself for an Engagement. The next Morning the Fight began, near the Promontory <HI>Rachabo:</HI> Both Parties lost each of them two Ships; but <HI>Matelief</HI>'s Gun-powder growing short, he resolv'd to clap them aboard, and enter.

<PB N="484" REF="303"/>Shore. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> Fleet wanting all Necessaries, steer'd for the Kingdom of <HI>Jor,</HI> there to get such Provision as was to be had: but the chiefest which they wanted, being Gunpowder, <HI>Jor</HI> could no ways furnish them withal: Yet the <HI>Hollanders</HI> not willing to leave their Business half undone, resolv'd (come of it what would) to fall upon the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Fleet that Rode at an Anchor under <HI>Malacca.</HI> In the first Engagement <HI>Matelief</HI> conquer'd four of the greatest Gal∣lions; in the second, three. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> also burnt no small number of their little Vessels; so that the great Fleet, which consisted of sixteen Gallions, four Galleys, fourteen Foysts, and one Carvil, Mann'd with three thousand seven hundred <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and above twice as many more <HI>Indians</HI> (at which the Kingdoms <HI>Achien, Jor, Pahan,</HI> and <HI>Patama</HI> trembled,) had nothing remain∣ing but a few ruin'd Ships, by a small Fleet.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hollanders Trade to <HI>Bengala,</HI></NOTE>Moreover, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> also drive a vast Trade to <HI>Bengala.

<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> Staple is in <HI>Ongli,</HI> where the <HI>English</HI> also keep a Store-house. But the King of <HI>Bengala,</HI> in return for the Aid he receiv'd from <HI>Batavia,</HI> hath given the <HI>Hollanders</HI> so great Priviledges, that the <HI>English</HI> effect but little there. Their Residence is up in the Countrey near the famous River <HI>Ganges.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> Store-house, built of Stone, is fortifi'd by a strong Fort with twelve Guns, and very deep and broad Trenches, upon one side of it are a hundred Huts made of Straw and Leaves, by the Natives call'd <HI>Gabbegalbes.</HI> These Leaves are three Foot and a half long, three Fingers broad, sharp at the ends, and prove convenient shelters against the Weather.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bengala</HI> Merchants go very handsom in Apparel.</NOTE>¶ THe <HI>Bengala</HI> Merchants go very richly Clothed; their Hair cut very short they cover with a Ribbon of white Cotton, commonly fifty Yards long: they wear short Whiskers, but their Beards hang down to their Breast; their upper Garment is a Coat of fine white Linnen, Laced before with white Silk Ribbon, and about their Waste a Silk Girdle, hanging down under their right Arm; their Breeches are not unlike the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and their red Shoes agree with the <HI>Moors.</HI> The ordinary Man goes bare-headed, with a Cloth thrown about his middle, and a pair of narrow Breeches; Shoes and Stock∣ings they use none.

<PB N="485" REF="303"/>
<P>¶ TO the West of <HI>Bengala</HI> lies <HI>Negopatam,</HI> a great Town, inhabited by <HI>Moors,</HI> which drive a vast Trade at Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negopatam.</NOTE> but oftentimes use <HI>Dutch</HI> Pilots. The Ropes of their Ships are made of Shells, or Barks of Trees.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Womens Habit there.</NOTE>The Apparel of the <HI>Negopatam</HI> Women is very strange: for those that are of any Quality wear a fine Shift, through which the upper part of their Body is seen, then a Cloth wrapp'd about them six times, covers them from the mid∣dle downwards; their Elbows are adorn'd with Golden Armlets two Fingers broad. But that which is most foolish, the Female <HI>Moors</HI> wear two Gold Rings through their Noses.</P>
<P>The Town <HI>Negopatam,</HI> lying on an even Shore between two Rivers, hath neither Gates, nor Walls.</P>
<P>In the Rivers are always store of Barques and Fisher-mens Boats. Before the City are several Wharfs on which they build their little Vessels.</P>
<P>Six Leagues from <HI>Negopatam</HI> lies <HI>Pulo Pille,</HI> provided with large Docks for great Ships.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange way of Marry∣ing.</NOTE>¶ THe <HI>Negopatam</HI> Parents Marry their Children in the eighth and ninth year of their age; at which Solemnities the Bride and Bridegroom sit in a Sedan one over against another, whilst the Guests drink themselves dead drunk, and Dance, Hollow, and clap their Hands like frantick Persons.</P>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Hollanders</HI> Store-house is built with cross Timber-work, mix'd with Stone. When the Governor of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company comes abroad, either on Horseback, or carry'd in a <HI>Palankin,</HI> or Sedan, he hath a great Guard of <HI>Moors</HI> with him, all Arm'd with round Shields, and long Swords.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> barter here a sort of <HI>Japan</HI> Wood, us'd at the burning of dead Corpses; and also the <HI>China</HI> Root, <HI>Japan</HI> Chests, Porcelan, and Cam∣phire, against all sorts of Cottons. Formerly they us'd to freight their Ves∣sels with <HI>Negopatam</HI> Rice; but since <HI>Japan</HI> abounds in that Grain, they gave over that Trade.</P>
<P>Lastly, the <HI>East-India</HI> Company drive a great Trade in Elephants, of which <HI>Ceylon</HI> affords the best.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they transport Ele∣phants.</NOTE>The transporting of them is somewhat strange, being in large Barques, cover'd over on the top with <HI>Palmito</HI>-Trees, cut off close by the Ground: the Leaves whereof are the most acceptable Food for the Elephants. When the Barque carries the Elephant aboard of a great Ship, they blind and hoise him over with strong Cables; under his Belly they put pieces of four-doubled Canvase, so broad, that it reaches from his fore to his hind-Legs; and when thus hoised over, they put them under Deck, and place them one over against another, putting onely a Manger with Fodder between them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> meddle not with the looking after these Monsters, but the <HI>Ceylonians</HI> creep under their Bellies, and rake away the Dung.</P>
<P>¶ THe Elephant is the chief pattern of the wonderful Works of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> 40. <HI>Vers.</HI> 15, 16. <HI>Behemoth.</HI></NOTE> God calls him <HI>Behemoth: Behold now</HI> Behemoth <HI>which I made with thee, he eateth grass as an Ox, Lo now his strength is in his loins, and his force is on the navel of his belly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Lyra,</HI> following the Opinion of most of the
<PB N="486" REF="304"/><HI>Rabbins,</HI> understand that <HI>Behemoth</HI> is an Elephant, and created on the same day that Man was; and though it be a fearful Monster, yet it is afraid of Man∣kind: for he satisfies himself like an Ox with what the Earth produceth, and trembles at the smell of a Mans foot-steps.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Elephants far exceed those of <HI>Africa.</HI> The strength of those in <HI>India</HI> may be judg'd by the great Towers which they carry on their backs.</P>
<P>In the Wars by <HI>Antiochus Eupator</HI> against the <HI>Jews,</HI> every Elephant carry'd a small Tower with thirty six Soldiers, besides the <HI>Indian</HI> which guided him. That these Monsters live three hundred years <HI>Aristotle, Pliny, Ambrose,</HI> and <HI>Non∣nus</HI> witness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy of the Elephants.</NOTE>Moreover, <HI>Philostratus</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> Writer saith, That the Elephant is likest to Man of any Beast in Policy and Prudence: his Sence the Elephant expresses two ways, either by his natural Apprehension, or by good Instruction: to the first must be reckon'd, that the Elephant rowls himself in the Mudd against the heat of the Sun; and when he goes to drink, he first stirs the Water with his Snout, that he may not swallow any hurtful Creature; which is more cre∣dible than what <HI>Theophilactus Simocatus</HI> saith, That the Beast stirs the Water be∣cause he is afraid of his own Shadow. When they go to wade through any River, the youngest walk before, for otherwise the old ones would sink and make the Ground deeper by their weight, so that the young ones could not possibly get over.</P>
<P>But concerning the Apprehensions of this Beast, several credible Witnesses give us many remarkable Examples. <HI>Seneca, Pliny,</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> relate, That the Elephants in the Theatre at <HI>Rome,</HI> not onely Fenc'd with Swords, but Danc'd on the Ropes.</P>
<P><HI>Hieronimus Osorius</HI> relates, That <HI>Anno</HI> 1514. an <HI>Indian</HI> Elephant bow'd him∣self three times to Pope <HI>Leo</HI> the tenth.</P>
<P><HI>Augerus Busbequius</HI> relates in his Embassy to the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperor, That he saw a young Elephant, who observ'd the steps, and Danc'd exactly after the Time of a string'd Instrument, and cast a Ball backwards.</P>
<P>It deserves peculiar observation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. Lyps. ad Janum. Hautanum.</NOTE> what <HI>Peter Bellon,</HI> an eye-witness, related to <HI>Carolus Clusius,</HI> who told it again to <HI>Justus Lipsius,</HI> That his Elephant coming weary and hungry into the Stable, where he found an Ass eating of Corn, he drove him from the Manger, and eat up what he found: but soon after the Master of the Elephant coming into the Stable, gave him his fill of Corn; the Beast considering the wrong which hunger had made him do the Ass, he divided the Corn, and gave the Ass as much as he had taken from him.</P>
<P>This vast Monster,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 9.</NOTE> as we said, is very fearful of Man-kind. <HI>Pliny</HI> saith, <Q>So soon as the Elephant spies the foot-steps of a Man, though he never saw one before, he is afraid of private Ambuscades, and looking about him, goes not a step forwarder, but makes it known to his followers, so from one to the ve∣ry last; whereupon they all return.</Q></P>
<P>The same <HI>Pliny</HI> relates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 5.</NOTE> That <HI>Bacchus</HI> set thirty Elephants against several Prisoners which he had condemn'd; but they, less bestial than their Master, would not observe or obey his cruel Commands: Wherefore <HI>Ptolomy Physcon</HI> made the Elephants drunk when he would have the naked <HI>Jews,</HI> with their Wives to be put to death. And full as fearful they are of Stags.</P>
<P>When <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great had past beyond the utmost bounds of the <HI>Hercu∣lean Pillars</HI> and <HI>Bacchus</HI> Encamp'd his Army, those that were sent into the For∣rests for Wood, came amazedly running back upon the sight of a great num∣ber
<PB N="487" REF="304"/>of Elephants coming towards their Army: at which <HI>Porus,</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> King encourag'd <HI>Alexander,</HI> telling him, That he need not fear the least danger, if his Troopers took but some Hogs on their Horses, and with beating com∣pell them to make a noise, at which the Elephants all return'd back again into the Woods.</P>
<P>¶ BUt to return again to <HI>Malacca:</HI> This City is inhabited by <HI>Hollanders, Chineses,</HI> and <HI>Malacquers.</HI> Half a Mile off at Sea lies the <HI>Red Island,</HI> from whence the <HI>Hollanders</HI> took <HI>Malacca</HI> from the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Malacquers</HI> of <HI>Queda</HI> some years since maintain'd a War against the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, but were subdu'd by force of Arms.</P>
<P><HI>Queda</HI> belongs to the Queen of <HI>Achien</HI> on <HI>Sumatra;</HI> who not long since would have Marry'd with a <HI>Hollander,</HI> but that the Councel in <HI>Batavia,</HI> for several weighty Reasons, judg'd it no way convenient.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dingding</HI> an Island.</NOTE>¶ BEtween <HI>Queda</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> thirty Leagues from <HI>Meaco,</HI> lies the uninhabited Isle <HI>Dingding,</HI> close by the <HI>Marine</HI> Coast.</P>
<P>Here is that famous red Wood, of which the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, <HI>Anno</HI> 1663. made a trial.</P>
<P>The Haven before <HI>Dingding</HI> full of Fish, and very safe, which they enter Eastward, and go out Westward.</P>
<P>The Water which flows from the Mountains along the Valleys into the Sea, is as good as any fresh Water in <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>A League Westward from <HI>Dingding</HI> appear the three Islands, which the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> for a certain accident call'd <HI>The Man-eaters Isles,</HI> because the <HI>Weesop</HI> and <HI>Schelling</HI> Frigats were cast away there, and the People which were sav'd, going ashore were all slain by the Inhabitants.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1661. five Ships going from <HI>Malacca</HI> to fetch their Countrey-men, found them unbury'd; whereupon they brought their Guns ashore, to take revenge on the Cannibals, and built a Ship of the Pieces of the Wreck that were remaining, which was afterwards us'd at <HI>Malacca.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe <HI>East-India</HI> Company traffick at <HI>Mesopatam,</HI> with <HI>Japan</HI> wax'd Chests, Copper and Silver, besides other <HI>European</HI> Commodities.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mesopatam</HI> is a great City, inhabited by <HI>Moors</HI> that drive a vast Trade with large Ships; the Tackle whereof is made of Trees, as we mention'd before.</P>
<P>¶ IN <HI>Peleacato</HI> is also no small Trade driven, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> having a Fort there close under the City, fortifi'd with sixty Guns, which was assault∣ed by the Natives; but being beaten off by <HI>Laurence Pitman,</HI> left a considerable number of their Party dead behind them: after which <HI>Peleacato</HI> came wholly under the subjection of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company.</P>
<P>The Vessels which they have there are very remarkable, and by them call'd <HI>Catamarous,</HI> being four round pieces of Wood ty'd together: he that steers it sits with his back-side in the Water, Dabbles with his Feet, and Rows with an Oar, small in the middle, and broad at the end, which he moves to and again, so making his way very fast through the Water.</P>
<P>The King, who keeps his Residence up in the Countrey, is a Tributary to the great <HI>Mogull.</HI></P>

<P>On the same Fort stands an exceeding high Mast, upon whose top is plac'd a Flag five hundred Yards long, which is seen eight Leagues off at Sea.</P>

<P>The <HI>Malabar</HI> Coast produceth good store of Ambergreece, which in stormy Weather thrown upon the Shore, the <HI>Malabars,</HI> a strong People, strugling with the Waves, take up in great quantities, and preserve in their Stores.</P>
<P>THus we have given you a large account of the present Estate, prodigious Wealth and wonderful Magnificence of the Empire of <HI>Japan,</HI> taken out of the Journals of several Embassies from the Councel of the <HI>Netherland East-India</HI> Company, setled in <HI>New Batavia;</HI> being the latest and fullest Observations that ever were taken concerning that Isle, reaching within three years of this our present Publication, presuming the Discourse, though long, will not be tedious, the variety of Argument being such, and so strange, that hitherto, we presume, hath scarce reach'd any <HI>English</HI> Ear. If this by Volume meet with a kind acceptation, we shall be encourag'd to give you betwixt our great <HI>Atlantick</HI> Work, for your divertisement, a Continuation of <HI>China,</HI> as full of Novelty, and as much, or rather more illustrated with Sculptures than the former.</P>
