<P>THE joyful News of Sir <HI>Clowdsley Shovel</HI>'s Success at <HI>Dublin</HI>-Harbour, has much Elevated the de∣prest Spirits of our poor Friends here; and I doubt not but it will meet with the like joyful accep∣tance where-ever it comes, which has much induced me to send you this Letter, which will give you an account of a notable Engagement.</P>
<P>THe before-mentioned Worthy Commander, with the Squa∣dron of Ships mentioned in my last, Arrived safe on <HI>Good-Friday</HI> last, in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Dublin,</HI> where he spyed in the Harbour, the <HI>Irish</HI> Admiral (a <HI>Scoth</HI> Ship taken from Captain <HI>Hammilton,</HI> and now Commanded by one <HI>Patrick Bennet</HI>) with about Twenty other Vessels of smaller Burthen, Laden with Hides, Tal∣low,
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>and Butter, riding at Anchor in <HI>Polebeg,</HI> within the Bar. Where∣upon the Captain quitted his own Ship (She being of too great a Bur∣then to enter the Harbour,) and went on Board the <HI>Monmouth</HI>-Yatch, and with That, and Two more, he went over the Bar, Steering his Course directly towards the <HI>Irish</HI>-Admiral, who cut her Cables, and endeavoured to run up to <HI>Kingsend-Point</HI> (as the other Vessels did, du∣ring the Engagement,) but Sir <HI>Clowdsley Shovel</HI> being under Sail, approached so fast, that he forced an Engagement; and the Fight lasted an hour, being closely fol∣lowed on both sides; after which, Captain <HI>Bennet</HI> seeing little hopes of Victory, and perceiving many of his Men to lye dead on the Decks, he run the Ship on ground, on the South <HI>Strand,</HI> and the Capt. and what Men he had left alive, made their Escape, and got on Shore, leaving his Ship a Prize to that Worthy Commander, our <HI>English</HI> Captain. The Firing so briskly in the Harbour, soon Al∣larmed the City, whereupon King <HI>James,</HI> and his small Army, being Two Regiments of Foot, and One of Horse, came down on the <HI>Strand,</HI> by <HI>Andrew Cave</HI>'s House (about half a Mile from <HI>Ringsend</HI>) dread∣ing an Invasion, and fearing the business would have gone farther than the loss of his Ships. Sir <HI>Clowdsley</HI> Man'd out some long Boats, and by the help of the Tide, brought off the Vessel: King <HI>James</HI> himself being a Spectator, and Eye∣witness of this our Commanders Bravery, and his own great loss: And I believe was glad it proceeded no farther. All the Opposition his gazing Soldiers gave, was, Two <HI>French</HI> Troops rid into the Water, and shot their Pistols against the side of the Ship: In recompence whereof, a Shot was sent from the Ship, which brought one of the Troopers into the Water, his Horse being shot under him.</P>
<P>Two Boys ran from the Shore (being <HI>Protestants</HI>) up to their Necks in Water, desiring help from the Sea-men, and were taken up by one of the long Boats.</P>
<P>In this Action we lost not a Man, neither had we any but one Wound∣ed, though there were found in the Enemies Vessels Twenty Dead, besides others, which in the Fight, undoubtedly dropt over-Board.</P>
<P>On <HI>Munday</HI> last came in here Forty Five Waggons, belonging to the Train of Artillery; and yester∣day Morning they went down to <HI>Highlake.</HI></P>
<P>Yesterday came in here Count <HI>Nassaw</HI>'s Regiment of Foot: And to Morrow comes in another Regi∣ment of Foot.</P>
<P>We hear from <HI>Lisburne,</HI> of the 14th Instant, That the Forces Shipt off at <HI>Bristol,</HI> are safely Arrived there, consisting of Three Thou∣sand Men: And that Fifty Thou∣sand Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> came thither that day: And that our Men are Hearty, and the Weather good; so that we suddenly expect to hear of further Action.</P>
