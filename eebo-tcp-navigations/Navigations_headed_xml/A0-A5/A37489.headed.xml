The Stories are here told under seigned Names, that we might preserve that Respect and Reverence due to their Title and Grandeur.</P>

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION</HEAD>
<P>THe Noble <HI>Melintus,</HI> whose Arms abroad had been no less Successful than his Amours at Court, the one Rendring his Name equally terrible to his Foes, as the other did his Person, Lovely to those Beau∣teous Ladies his Generous Addresses had Acquainted him with; On a sudden for∣sook the Court, and Sigh'd away his bitter Hours in a Solitary R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tirement. When the News was Spread, the Noble <HI>Melintus</HI> was withdrawn, it Rais'd a Wonder in all; His own Merits having Gain'd him more then Ordinary favour from his Prince, and his Courtly presence, and Obliging Mean Won a respect from all that knew him. The Count his Ʋncle more particularly Enquired the Reason of his present discontent, from whom at length with much difficulty, he Forced a dis∣covery.
<PB N="2" REF="5"/> <HI>I must, my Lord,</HI> (says <HI>Melintus) Bless that Happy Minute when first I saw the Matchless</HI> Corinna, <HI>and Curse the Severity of my Stars whose kinder Influence ought to have given Her more constancy, or me less concern, for that Loss, I now but in vain Lament, Shee's gone! My Lord, Shee's lost to Me for ever! My hated Rival now Surfeits with delights in those Curling Armes I once thought mine; Every kiss he takes is a Blessing stoln from Me, nor has He Honour enough to pity, but Scorns, laughs at my Miseries, and with the Me∣mory of my sufferings, whets his Cloyd Appetite to fresh Enjoyments, Melintus</HI> would have proceeded, but the Count hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng now the true Cause of his Melancholy, chose rather to divert his Passion then Encourage it by a further discourse upon the same Ʋn∣happy Subject; And like a subtle Rhetori∣tian with undiscerned Charms, led his heedless Auditor wide from his present Theme of Sorrow, to a more Soft and Comi∣cal
<PB N="3" REF="5"/> Entertainment: And when he took leave promis'd to send <HI>Geronto,</HI> his old witty Companion, and some others of his Friends, both Gentlemen and Ladies, the next Af∣ternoon to Visit him; Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se facetious Hu∣mours, and pleasant Conversation would divert his Melanchely, and prove the most powerful Cordial to recover a dispairing Lo∣ver. Accordingly the next day, <HI>Geronto, Lysander, Florimel</HI> and <HI>Aurelia,</HI> went over to <HI>Barn-Elms,</HI> where <HI>Melintus</HI> had for some days past Conceal'd himself, that he might more luxuriously Indulge his discontented thoughts free from the Trouble of Ceremonious Visitants. No sooner had they saluted <HI>Melintus,</HI> whose Cloudy Fore∣head spoke the present Anguish of his Soul; But in came <HI>Parmenio</HI> and <HI>Philotas,</HI> each leading his Mistress, the fair <HI>Evadne</HI> and Beautifull <HI>Theodosia. Melintus</HI> was not a little Surpriz'd to see his Friends Crowd in so fast upon him, when <HI>Geronto</HI> (their Mutual Civilities being past began to Rally <HI>Melintus</HI> with such sharp Excursions as his
<PB N="4" REF="6"/> great Wit had alwayes priviledg'd him to at Court, and his Intimate acquaintance might now more freely Challenge from his Friend, the little bickerings with Repartees being over, in which the Ladies, especially <HI>Florimel,</HI> lost no advantage, they fell upon more Compos'd Discourses, and as nothing could be more agreeable to the Company, nor any Subject more proper then that of Love, <HI>Geronto</HI> whose Talent was great that way, first broke the Ice, and began with this Harangue,</P>

<HEAD>NOVEL the First.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GERONTO.</BYLINE>
<P>A Gentleman, younger Brother of a very good Family in the West of <HI>England,</HI> ha∣ving had the advantage of a Liberal Education at the University of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> left those happy Walls, esteeming that sort of Colleg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate Im∣prisonment too narrow for his more aspiring and ambitious Thoughts, which now began to feel the heats of Love, and Warmer desires of attaining that pitch of Honour and Reputation his Ancestors had Arrived to. Having thus taken leave of his Studies, he return'd into the Countrey to receive the plentiful provision his Father had by Will assigned him, which amounted to 4000 li. on which foundation (tho' Inconsiderable to what his elder Brother en∣joy'd) he doubted not to raise as Substantial a fortune by his Industrious Improvement as his Birth-right had deny'd him: With this Inten∣tion, knowing the Barren Soyl of a Countrey
<PB N="6" REF="7"/> Life, was not so fit to accomplish his designs as the more fruitful emploiments that attende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Court and City, he repaired to <HI>London:</HI> But bringing with him a Temper too Generous to Flatter, and too Gentile to Cozen, he quickly found without the first he must expect no pre∣ferment at Court, and wanting the Second it was Impossible to advantage himself am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dst a Crowd, whose only patrimony was their craft. In the midst of these Thoughts he had often re∣solv'd to return to the more innocent diversions of the Countrey; But finding himself intangled in his Affairs, and engaged in the acquaintance of the Town Gallants, who at first had insensibly wrought him into their Society, by those Nets and Subtletys they Spread to catch the heedless and Unwary; And being softned by the charms and allurements of the fairer Sex, to whose Visits he was every day enticed, he found it impossible to discharge himself of these Inconve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iences, tho' he had before his Eyes the most dismal prospect of misery, and inevitable Ruine of his Fortun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s which now beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to con∣fume a pace, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in three years time the whole Treasure was quite Exhausted. His Compani∣ons who had so often been reliev'd by his Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rous kindness were so far from pitying or Assist∣ing him in these distresses, that like the Summer
<PB N="7" REF="7"/> Birds, they left his Winter'd Quarters to seek a Spring in some warmer Climate, without the least Gratitude or kind remembrance of those Lavish kindnesses with which they had been so often refresh'd? In thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Condition, Repen∣tance, the usual Comerade of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stress, presented her wrinkled Face to the poor undone Youth, and brought into his Thoughts his f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r mis∣carriges, but with all left him destitut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of any obliging Clue to Extricate himself fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m the La∣byrinth his follies and Misfortunes had Insnar'd him in. How ready he then was to curse the Influence of those Starrs that frown'd at his Birth, and Rais'd in his own Breast an Enemy against himself; To blame his past Improvidence, and all the Obliquityes of his former Conduct; They can best Judge who have seen and known how few Friends adversity affords, and how the pleasures of former prosperity are the bitter∣est Ingredients of present Calamity.</P>
<P>In this deplorable Estate after that by renew'd sollicitations he had wearied all his Friends, Poverty began to grow Shamefull, his wonted Embroideryes were now worn into Rags, the Treats and Regalios' with which he had tired out the day, and Stole from the Hours of Rest to Solace himself with, now Tantaliz'd his present Hunger; His Beds of Down and softer
<PB N="8" REF="8"/> Companions of Nightly Amours, were now no more, a Numerous concourse of Dunns with their Loud Alarms broke his Rest, and like Hornets with their Stinging Demands, perpetu∣ally tormented him, and he who but a little be∣fore was the Court and admiration of every Flattering Sycophant, is now their Scorn and Laught<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. Instead of his Livery'd Attendants, the Staff Officers w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch his Steps, and nothing but the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>my of a Prison and the Gripes of penury, are the thoughts with which he En∣tertains himself; So that being forc'd to the utmost Extremity, he resolv'd rather with the Prodigal, to return to his Fathers House, than feed upon Husks amongst the <HI>London</HI> Swine; To which End, having Rais'd as much Money as the remains of his Moveables would pledge for, he began his Journey for the West, hoping his Friends would Commiserate his indigent Condition, however one Blessing he was sure of, to be out of the Noise and Clamour of his Ravenous Creditours. His Money being short he was forc'd to Travel on Foot, nor had he hopes it could carry him to his Journey End, but resolving to trust his better fortune he set forward; And having Travelled three dayes saw the last penny disposed of. The Evening now drew on apace, and he found himself Ex∣treamly
<PB N="9" REF="8"/> wearied, no prospect of a Town to lodge at, or Money to pay for't, or other ne∣cessaries he had occasion for, going heavily on under so great a load of trouble and discontent, and pondering with himself, if it was altogether impossible for the wit of Man to find out a Re∣medy for these present Evils, lifting up his eyes, at a distance espied a Countrey Village half a Mile before him, which as soon as he had over∣taken, he fate down under a Hedge which be∣long'd to a Neighbouring House, to consider what course to take to relieve his present want: Upon this Hedge there were several pieces of Linnen hung out to dry, and tho' it was now late in the Evening, yet such was their Security and so great the Honesty of those Countrey Hobs, that they fear'd no filching hand to Thieve them away; the full Moon which with her Silver Beams supplyed the Brightness of the Golden day, discover'd the Temptation to him, nor could he observe any Person near to Guard the Hedge: But being never us'd to Steal, he was very loth to begin now, nor was he less Averse to Beg; But urg'd by his extremities he was about to bear away some of the Linnen; when putting his Hand into his Pocket he found a pair of Dice; Are you here still? Said he, here still? To torment, but not assist Me! Oh
<PB N="10" REF="9"/> base and bewitching Tools, the Wisemans scorn Charms to the fool, and Panders to the Knave! here still; To refresh my Memory how you Ruin'd and deceiv'd Me! I have heard amongst your friends you have been Stil'd, the substance of hope, the miserable Mans last relief, and is it possible to find one sitter to receive your fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors then my self; Assist me then, and Umpire be∣tween my necessity and Honesty, whilst I pursue my Intentions to play fairly with this Hedge for the Linnen it is Cloathed with, and less needs then my distressed S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oulders, which want a Covering. Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t am I resolved, if you cross my hopes, <HI>I</HI> will yet be Just to my Losses and pay what you decree against me, and i you strip me I shall then forswear your Assistance for the Future, and trust my self Naked to the Charity of well disposed Christians, from whom <HI>I</HI> will hope for that good fortune and Reasonable re∣lief which you deny me,</P>
<P>Come then and lets try the Chances; Here Mr. Hedge, my Hat against that shirt: 7 is the Main, have at it; 12, Pox ont', out at the first Throw! There't goes again, my Coat against those two Handkerchiefs and four Aprons, 6 is the Main, now 12 good Dice, or I'm undone, ha! 5 to 6, I've the worst on't, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t away, now Cater Ace, Tra Duce, what are you?

In so disconsolate a tone did <HI>Amas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> deliver himself, that he strangely Surpriz'd the hearers with pity for his Conditi∣on, the reason of which they could not pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibly imagine. His Father was immediately a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in∣ted with it, who coming to his Bed-side found him extreamly ill, and fitter for the Advice of the Physitians then the Entertainment of his Frien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, or the intended Solemnity. The Doctors were sent for to consult of his present Distemper, who all agreed he was in a High Feaver, but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the cause thereof was not Ex∣ternal, but from some ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raordinary grief which opprest his Spirits, and was not to be remov'd by al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Learned prescriptions, nor could they advise a more proper Cure then what they endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d to prevent his Death. For some week<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this miserable Condition, did he linger out the tedious Hours, to the great trouble and discomfort of his Relations, who daily Visited him, and as often prest to know the cause of his present affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction, which he the more carefully strove to hide, nor could they Guess at any pro∣bable cause, but as they observ'd his deep Sighs, and then of a sudden his pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sionate and abrupt expressions of O dear <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>telia,</HI> happy <HI>Ort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lia,</HI> but

However after six weeks Languishing under his illness, he began to grow into a better State of health, but his Melancholy increased upon him; Though his Father endea∣vour'd by all imag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neable diversions to drive it from his wounded mind, and supposing he yet knew nothing of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>telia</HI>'s Death, resolv'd to Conceal it from him, till he had in some mea∣sure Estrang'd his Affect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons from her, which he hoped in time to Effect. But after two Months were pass'd, and <HI>Amasius</HI> was rather
<PB N="50" REF="31"/> worse then better, he began to think that if his Son, knew of <HI>Ortelia</HI>'s death an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the impossi∣bility of ever enjoying her, it might by degrees quiet his troubled mind, and put him upon s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me thoughts of perfecting the Match he had design'd him with much advantage. Accordingly one Evening he took an opportunity to disclose <HI>Or∣telia</HI>'s Death to him omiting those Circumstan∣ces that more particularly concern'd her love to him, which would rather aggravate then al∣lay his passion,</P>
<P><HI>Alas Sir! said</HI> Amasius, <HI>I have long since known more of that affair then you are pleas'd to Communicate to me now; I know that</HI> Ortelia <HI>is dead, and that</HI> Amasius <HI>can never be happy till he is so too; But for this I must blame the weakness of my Love, that what a Woman could do for me, I cannot for her, nor dare not, Since I am forbid all violent Remedies, which adds to my afflicti∣on, and prevents that Cure, which otherwise I would soon accomplish.</HI></P>
<P>His Father was strangely Surpriz'd to see himself prevented in his disc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very, and com∣manded <HI>Amasius</HI> to tell him how he came by his Intelligence, supposing that contrary to his or∣der
<PB N="51" REF="31"/> some of his Friends had acquainted him with it.</P>
<P>Amasius <HI>humbly beg'd his Pardon, and assur'd him, it was not from his Relations or any Person else he had Entrusted with the Secret, that he came by the knowledge of it, and earnestly pray'd him not to press that question any farther, which if in Obedience to his Commands he should be oblig'd to An∣swer, would yet add more to that weight of sorrow he so miserably labour'd under.</HI></P>
<P>This made the old Gentleman his Father the more Inquisitive, who conjur'd him by that re∣spect and duty he ow'd him as his Father, to give him a plain and Satisfactory account, which without any excuse he immediately expected from him.</P>
<P><HI>Well Sir, said</HI> Amasius, <HI>since you will extort a Secret from me, which of all things can only make me more Ʋnhappy, take it, and Judge if my Duty to you is not above all regard to my self — Here</HI> Amasius <HI>ac∣quainted his Father how he had s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en</HI> Or∣telia, <HI>and the discourse he had with her, the Night before his intended Nuptials, Ad∣ding
<PB N="52" REF="32"/> withal, that in declaring what he had forc'd him to, he should be the most mise∣rable of Men, as the Sequel of his Ʋnhappy Life approv'd him to be.</HI></P>
<P>Some time after his Father by the Advice of his Friends, remov'd <HI>Amasius</HI> into the Countrey, and having several Relations and acquaintance near <HI>York,</HI> that place was fixt upon, hoping that Change of Air and variety of Company might be of advantage to his Health, and a diversion to his Melancholy. But Alas! He never En∣joy'd a Minute free from the thoughts of his fair deceas'd <HI>Ortelia,</HI> the only Intervals of plea∣sure he had, were when the kind Ghost of <HI>Orte∣telia</HI> came to visit him, which she was often wont to do, or at least his deluded Fancy Imagined so, from that time (when by the Severity of his Fa∣ther he was forc't to discover that he had both seen and discoursed with her the Night before the intended Marriage.) At several times would he start upon a sudden from his Company, say∣ing, do you not hear <HI>Ortelia</HI>'s voice? I come, I come, my Dear, Ah there she is, pray do but observe how kindly the poor <HI>Ortelia</HI> looks on her <HI>Amasius,</HI> see how Melancholy and pale she is, how beautifully sorrowful she Glances at me, Oh my Dear I come, but when shall I come, never
<PB N="53" REF="32"/> to part from thee more? Oh that this was that blessed Hour that would make me for ever hap∣py with thee! And then retireing into the next Room, would talk with the same passionate Ex∣pressions of Love and tenderness to her, as if he did really Converse with her in the visible form of Flesh and Blood. Thus did he pass away about half a year, when one Night after he had been walking and discoursing with her for at least two Hours (tho' at all these several times she was never seen by any Person but himself, sometimes indeed they could distinguish two several Voices) when returning to his Friends more pleasant and Merry then ever he had been before, I thank Heaven, sayes he, my sorrows have now found a period; I have but few nights more to repose on Earth, and then shall I live with my <HI>Ortelia,</HI> and enjoy Eternal Rest of Bo∣dy and Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nquillity of mind. That Night he Slept heartily and next Morning arose early in a most Serene and Compos'd Temper, at which his Friends were extreamly pleased, and tho' they were much Surpriz'd at the discourse of his ap∣proaching Death, yet seeing him continue so well for three dayes, they began to forget their fears, and please themselves with the vain hopes of his perfect recovery. The next day being <HI>Thursday,</HI> and Bowling-day, it was agreed they
<PB N="54" REF="33"/> should take their Horses and Ride to the Green, and there Dine with other Gentlemen who usu∣ally Met there once a Week: <HI>Amasius</HI> chear∣fully consented to it, which was the more taken Notice of, it being the first time they could ever prevail with him to go into a publick Company, or divert himself with any Sociable Recreation. After Dinner they Bowl'd again, when a dispute arising about a Cast, <HI>Amasius</HI> took his friends part, at which his Adversary was so Incensed (being a Cholerick Person) that he struck him with his fist, but the Gentlemen who were pre∣sent interposeing they prevented any farther Mischief. <HI>Amasius,</HI> who disdain'd to receive so publick an Injury with the patience of a coward, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thdrew into the Garden, and privately sent a note to the Gentleman to let him know, he there expected with his Sword in his Hand Satifacti∣on for the Affront he had put upon him. His ad∣versary came, and after some few passes ran <HI>Amafius</HI> through the heart, of which he imme∣diately dyed, and went with Joy to meet his Dear <HI>Ortelia</HI> in the Shades below, to the great Grief of his Father and all his friends, who had known his Vertuous and Honourable Accom∣plishments.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="33"/>
<P>Aurelia <HI>having thus Finish'd her Tragi∣call Relation,</HI> Melintus <HI>paid her his more particular acknowledgements, nor did the Rest of the Company forget their Respe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, tho' all thought it an unreasonable Enter∣tainment for a Gentleman, whose present Di∣stemper had too much affinity to</HI> Honorius <HI>his Melancholy passion, and were not a lit∣tle apprehensive of the ill Effects it might produce.

<P>IT was the unhappiness of <HI>Cratander,</HI> whose Ge∣nerosity very often out-stript his prudence, and his Natural Bounty the Narrow Confines
<PB N="56" REF="34"/> of his Estate, to be at last reduc'd to great ne∣cessity, his Friends Commiserating his Condi∣tion advised how they might best assist his pre∣sent distress, and prevent his own and the disho∣nour of his family. They resolv'd at last upon a friendly Contribution to raise some Moneys, and present him with a good Gelding, and pro∣pos'd to him the going up to <HI>London,</HI> where he might put himself into some employ and par∣ticularly that of the Kings Guards, which would afford him a Gentile and competent Support. <HI>Cratander</HI> was easily perswaded to embrace the Councel of his friends, and not long after left the North his Native Countrey, and took his Journey to <HI>London.</HI> After he had spent some Months there in vain, either through his own ill Conduct, the Modesty of his Temper which could not Sue for favours with that Confidence which others succeed by, or that his Stars had design'd him for some greater end, having al∣most Spent the little Stock he had, he saw he should be soon forc't to Sell his Horse to buy Hay, and to Live longer there at so great Ex∣pence, woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most certainly involve him in Debt and Misery. In the midst of these distract∣ed thoughts he resolved to quit the Town, and make a Visit to an old Acquaintance who was Master of a plentifull Estate, and lived in the
<PB N="57" REF="34"/> West of <HI>England,</HI> and accordingly did so. The next Morning he set out early, and Travell'd al∣most fifty Miles, when Night coming upon him hastily he lost his way upon a great Common, and not knowing the Coast of the Countrey wandred up and down, till at last he spy'd a Candle at a Shepherds Cott about half a Mile, distance, which he steer'd up to. Hallowing to know who liv'd there, the Shepherd came out, of whom he Enquired the way to the Town he intended to Lodge at that Night, the Shep∣herd told him he was five Miles off, and the way difficult to find, if he was a stranger in the Countrey, <HI>Cratander</HI> told him he was, and had already lost his way and tired his Horse, and if he would be so kind to give him Accommo∣dation for that night, he would gratifie him to his Content.</P>
<P><HI>The Shepherd told him his was a House but of one Room, tho' plentifully Furnish'd with Inhabitants, that besides his Wife and himself he had Six Children, and but one Bed, and a Matress, and not so much as a Hovell to put his Horse in.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cratander</HI> then enquired if there was no neighbouring Village could give h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m a Recep∣tion for one night, the Shepherd told him a

The Maid carried back this answer, which surpriz'd the Young Lady, especially when her Ser∣vant told her he was a Gentleman on Horse∣back well accoutred, and <HI>Robin</HI> who was her Shepherd was with him, the Lady came present∣ly
<PB N="59" REF="35"/> to the Gate to whom <HI>Cratander</HI> with all Mo∣desty and respect address'd himself.</P>

<PB N="60" REF="36"/> She better design'd him, then was able to express upon so sudden an Occasion should be so far mistaken; That she hop'd her House, how mean∣ly soever Furnish'd, might afford him a better Lodging then her Stable, which she desir'd he would believe by accepting of it. <HI>Cratander</HI> was much out of Countenance at this repri∣mand, but recovering himself, Modestly reply'd, Dear Madam, you have already so infinitely oblig'd me that I had not Confidence enough to Trespass farther upon so Generous a Temper, especially when at the same time I consider my self an absolute stranger to you, which perhaps may create some fears and Jealousyes in your Family, though your Noble Breast which knows no Guilt in it self, can Harbor no suspition of others. The Lady Blusht and told him, She saw too much Honour in his Person and demean to Judge so unworthily of him, and desir'd he would please to take his Chair and pass away half an Hour, till his Chamber was prepar'd for him. <HI>Cratander</HI> had observ'd that both before and at Supper the Maid that waited had her eye constantly fixt upon him, and with a look that spoke Horror and Consternation, as if she sus∣pected him for a Person who had some Villai∣nous design brooding in his heart, which his being so well Arm'd gave occasion for, Nor

The Gentleman and Lady had pass'd away the time in variety of discourse, by wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch she was now fixt in a good Opinion of him, and had fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly banish'd those fears and apprehens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons her Maid had whisper'd in her Ear, when the Servant came down and told her the Chamber was ready, if the Gentle∣man pleas'd to go to Bed, upon which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Mistress order'd her to take the Candle and wait upon him to his Lodging. The Lady at∣tended him to his Chamber, and smilingly told him, Sir, pray Command whatever you want, and my house affords, I wish you good Rest and
<PB N="62" REF="37"/> hope your Lodging will be as pleasant here as in the Stable — <HI>Cratander</HI> would have reply'd, but the Lady was gone. The Maid having left the Gentleman to his rest, went to her Mistr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses Chamber, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re she began a fresh to discourse her form r Suspitions, but the Lady with a frown bid her be Silent and make h st to Bed; those Jealousyes were idle fancies only, and should never discompose her rest w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atever should be the issu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them, The Maid went to her Chamber, put out the Candle and lay'd her self upon the Bed, wishing for the Morning, which would dispell those Melancholy thoughts that now opprest her mind. Her present fears banish'd all Sleep from her Eyes, and the Clock had now struck One, when she heard a Noise in the Court-yard, starting up she ran to the win∣dow, where she saw four Men at the door, who first Tryed the Latch to see if it was open, and finding it fast Bolted and Lockt, they endea∣vour'd by main strength to force their Entrance, the Maid frighted out of her wits, ran to her Mistresses Chamber, where with her passionate Out cryes, She awaken'd her, and told her,</P>
<P><HI>There were four Robbers in the yard breaking into the House, who would certain∣ly Murder them all, and the Person She had
<PB N="63" REF="37"/> Entertain'd was no doubt of their Gang▪</HI></P>
<P>The Lady Alarm'd at this unexpected News, half distracted flew to <HI>Cratanders</HI> Chamber, who was fast asleep and loudly Snoreing, but she soon awakened him with her loud complaints, and upon her Knees with all the passion, and moving Rhetorick her fears could inspire her with.</P>
<P><HI>Beg'd her Life and Honour of him, and the preservation of her Family, and She would immediately deliver him all her Mo∣ney, Plate, Jewels, or whatever else he thought worth his acceptance; And in the same Breath repeated, but pray Sir Spare my Life, Spare my Honour, and I shall think my self indebted to you for whatever I part with besides.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cratander,</HI> whose thoughts at the lowest Ebb of fortune could never Entertain a base design, was no less Surpriz'd then the Lady, and told her.</P>
<P>Madam, <HI>I understand not your meaning, but if you please to be plain in your Expressi∣ons, I will defend both your Life and Ho∣nour with the utmost hazard of my own. Oh Sir,</HI> sayes the Lady, <HI>there are Theives
<PB N="64" REF="38"/> breaking into my House, and pardon me if I mistake you for one of their Confederates. Il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e convince you presently,</HI> reply'd Cra∣tander, <HI>and leaping out of Bed Slipt on his Clothes, and with his Sword and Pistols, by the Maids direction, made to that part of the House they first attempted,</HI> Cratander <HI>had the fortune to have just got to the door, when they forc't it open, and discharging one of his Pistols amongst them, he saw a Person drop, upon which they gave back; but he with his Sword in Hand, advanced two or three Steps, and by the opposition he met with, from one of them receiv'd a Slight Wound upon his Breast, which he reveng'd by another upon his Adve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>saries right Arm, which so d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sabled him that he gave back, and</HI> Cratander <HI>retreated to the door for fear their odd's might oppress him, whose safety depended only on his single Courage. The Thieves seem'd to go off, and left one of their Companions bleeding upon the Ground, which</HI> Cratander <HI>(by his Groans) suppos'd to be dying, but not knowing what
<PB N="65" REF="38"/> reserve of strength they might have, he made fast the door and went up to his Chamber, where he had left the Lady half dead with fear.</HI></P>
<P>Madam, says he, was it not for what your Lady ship has suffer'd in the affright I am hear∣tily glad of this opportunity, which has I hope in some measure made me Serviceable to your Ladyship, and given a Testimony of that Ho∣nour and Justice which before as a stranger might be quest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on'd in me. The Lady with tears in her Eyes, which stood ready to sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y out either with Joy or sorrow, return'd her thanks in the most gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teful Sense her words could ex∣press, call'd him the Preserver of her Life, Ho∣nour and Fortune, who certainly was s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt from Heaven, like a <HI>Guardian Angel,</HI> to defend her from the rapine and Violence of Theives and Murderers. After some care taken of his wound, which was not deep, they resolv'd not to go to Bed for fear of a Second Attaque, but in <HI>Cratanders</HI> Chamber spent the remainder of the Night, wishing for the Morning light, that they might safely discover the Person who was left behind dead upon the Spot; Assoon as the day appear'd, <HI>Cratander,</HI> the Lady, and the rest of the Family open'd the door, and in the yard found
<PB N="66" REF="39"/> a great quantity of blood spilt upon the Ground, but the Body was convey'd away, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h they could trace no farther then the out-ward Gate, which was left open, and the loc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> broke off; <HI>Cratander</HI> stayed two days till his wound was Clos'd, and the Lady recover'd from that Con∣sternation she was under, when ready on the third day to take his leave against all those ar∣guments of kindness and respect the Lady could press upon him, a Servant came over to invite her to the Funeral of her Uncle, a Gentleman of Competent Estate who liv'd ten miles off. The Lady was very much Surpriz'd to hear of her Uncles so sudden death, whom she had not known to be ill, and particularly enquir'd the cause, to whom the Servant could give no other Answer, but that going to Bed something indispos'd, he was found dead in the Morning, the Lady was now Furnish'd with fresh occasion of Grief, which she made use of as a powerful reason to perswade <HI>Cratander</HI> to stay one day longer, and particularly desir'd him to bear her Company to that mournfull Solemnity. <HI>Cratander</HI> told her he was extreamly sorry for her loss of so near a Relation — Alas Sir, says she, it is not that alone, I have a second loss in a good Friend, to whose Care and Advice my dying Father re∣commended me, and I have been sufficiently
<PB N="67" REF="39"/> sensible of his kindness in the management of those worldly affairs Women are generally bor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> strangers to. The next day being that of his Funeral, <HI>Cratander</HI> promis'd to wait upon her, and in the Interim endeavor'd to chear up her drooping Spirits with a Suitable Conversation to her Solemn grief. Being arrived at the House the Lady was earnest to know what sudden Di∣stemper was the cause of her Uncles death, her Aunt told her she suppos'd an Apoplexy, but desiring to see the Corps, she answer'd that be∣ing a Corpulent Fat Man the Coffin was nail'd up early in the Morning for fear the Body, which began already to Corrupt, should be offensive to the Company. The Lady was very well Satis∣fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with the answer, and led by <HI>Cratander,</HI> at∣tend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Corps to the Grave. At their re∣turn home discoursing of the Funeral, <HI>Cratander</HI> ask'd who that Gentleman was in the Brown Periwig that assisted at the Interment, The La∣dy told him, he was a Gentleman of intimate a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aintance with her Uncle, who had former∣ly a fair Estate, but his too lavish Hand had now forc'd him to receive his Support from the kindness of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more familiar and Charitab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Friends. Madam, sayes <HI>Cratander,</HI> did you not observe a black Ribbon tyed about the wrist of his Right Hand; yes Sir, sayes she, I did so, he is
<PB N="68" REF="40"/> a Gentleman who drinks high and is often in Broyls, I wish Madam, says <HI>Crata<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der,</HI> he was guilty of no other fault, tho' I cannot comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd a quarrelsom Temper in my b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Friends; but proceeds he, would you please to Seal my par∣don before-hand, I would make one step farther, which I shall do with all respect to the Memory or reputation of any Gentleman alive or dead.

Sir, says she you seem to hint someth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng more then I am willing to believe you do. Madam, reply'd <HI>Cra∣tander,</HI> I shall make no reserves in your Lady∣ships Company, but I heartily wish this Hand

<P><HI>Sir, sayes she, 'tis impossible I dare ac∣quit you, and do at this Minute, and pray let us discourse no farther on so unpleasant a Subject.</HI></P>
<P>Madam, sayes he, I will Trespass but in one word more, my Suspition commenc'd when I first saw that Gentleman at the House, before I ever knew he had any hurt on his Hand, for I observ'd I could never fix my Eye upon him but either through shame or Guilt he avoided the Test of my looks, and either chang'd Coun∣tenance, or Show'd some inward emotion of Spirit, which they who are better Read in the lines of Nature, and more Critically observe her Rules, would Construe in the same Sense that I do.</P>
<P><HI>Sir, sayes the Lady, I am no wayes averse to your Satisfaction in that point, but I would at the same time have a due regard to my Name and Family.</HI></P>
<P>Madam, reply'd <HI>Cratander,</HI> I will proceed by such wary Methods as you your self shall approve of; I will go to some Chirurgion there∣abouts, and complain the wound I receiv'd on my Breast Festers within, and advise with him
<PB N="70" REF="41"/> for the Cure, and so from one to another; and if this Gentlemans wound appears to be so, and no strain, in all probability he applyed himself to some Neigbouring Chiru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gion, and by him may receive some leading Circumstances to con∣firm or abate my Suspition.</P>
<P><HI>Sir, sayes the Lady, upon the Terms I be∣fore mentioned, you may use your pleasure. Cratander</HI> accordingly the next day took his Horse, and at a publick Inn near the Town wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the Uncle liv'd, desir'd to know if there was ever a Chirurgion in that part of the Coun∣try, whom he might safely intrust. The Land∣lord directed him to one at the next Town, to whom <HI>Cratander</HI> Show'd his wound, which was not perfectly Cured, and in discourse, was asking if he had much practice in the Country for green Wounds, the Chirurgion told him every tittle, and that by accident the other day, a Gentle∣man who had been engag'd in a quarrel receiv'd a Cut on his Right Hand, whom he now had under Cure, which had it not slanted a little had certainly Cut all his Muscles in two and for ever disabled him. The Person &amp; Circumstance of time he more particularly urg'd, but at that distance, as if rather for discourse sake then Enquiry, and found them all Correspond with his first Suspition. At Night he acquainted the
<PB N="71" REF="41"/> Lady with the particulars, and prevail'd with her, that he might get a Justice of Peaces War∣rant to apprehend him, and oblige him upon his Examination to give a Satisfactory account where and when he r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iv'd that wound. This was done and the Gentleman taken into Custo∣dy, who giving only Evasive Answers, was told if he would not be more positive and direct, they should be forc'd to charge him more Cri∣minally, which an ingenious Confession m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght prevent o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in some measure attone. The Gen∣tleman was in great confusion what to say, but at last fully Confest the whole matter, that he with two more whom he Named, were won by the Uncle upon the promise of a Considerable reward to assist him in this Enterprize, that they pitch'd upon that Night rather then any ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, because the Men-Servants would be abroad, and the House defenceless, that they had resolv'd to Murther the Young Lady and all the Family, for f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar they should hereafter tell any Tales, that the Uncle was Shot at the door where he receiv'd his hurt by <HI>Cratander,</HI> and afterwards they came back and brought of his Body for fear of a discovery. Upon this the Gentleman was committed to <HI>Winchester</HI> Gaol, the other Two having some Notice of it fled. The Body of the Uncle was taken up and found to be Shot in∣to
<PB N="72" REF="42"/> the Heart with a Pistol Bullet which was there found, the Motive to so bloody and barbarous a design, (besides the instigation of the Devil and his own Covetousness) was generally suppos'd to be the Estate of the Young Lady which de∣scended to him, who was her Fathers Younger Brother, and she the only Child he left behind. The Young Lady considering how miraculously she had been preserv'd, and that next to Heaven she ow'd her Life to the Courage and Gallantry of <HI>Cratander,</HI> Franckly told him.</P>
<P><HI>Sir, I never yet Enquired whether you was Married or no, nor was it a question ever in my Thoughts before, if you are not and will accept of my Person with the For∣tune that attends it, I hope to be Happy in your Embraces.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cratander,</HI> who little Expected that Fortune who had been alwayes a niggard to him, should now pour down her Blessings with so Lavish a Hand, in a Rapture of Bliss, cry'd out, O happy <HI>Cratander,</HI> for ever happy, Dear Madam I am yours for ever, and let the declining Sun tell the other part of the Globe how happy his Fel∣low Traveller is made to day; which she rea∣dily consented to, and they were immediately Married▪ within a Month after the Aunt dy∣ed
<PB N="73" REF="42"/> for grief, and that Estate fell to <HI>Cratander</HI> in Right of his wife who was next Heyr at Law; Thus Lives he Master of a fair Estate which his courage and generosity most worthily deserves.</P>
<P>Lysander <HI>ended his Story with the ap∣plause of the whole Company, and</HI> Melintus <HI>himself Smiled at the Close, and said th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lady could do no less then Crown her Cham∣pion with the full Enjoyment of her Estate and Person.</HI></P>
<P>Florimel <HI>whose turn it was to lead, de∣sir'd to be Excus d, that she had never a Story fit for such sober Company, but</HI> Me∣lintus <HI>told her he would admit no Excuse, She was not so Airy, hut She had some more serious Intervals, and he hop'd this was one of them.

<BYLINE>By FLORIMEL.</BYLINE>
<P><HI>CHarilus,</HI> (for under that Title I intend to disguise his proper English Name, out of
<PB N="74" REF="43"/> respect to his Person and quality) was the Eldest Son of a Worthy Gentleman in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and Heir to a fair Estate. His Father took parti∣cular care in his Education, to furnish him with all the Accomplishments Suitable to his parts and Character, for Nature had been prodigal to him in all the gifts of mind, which she inchas'd in a Body of Elegant Composure and perfect Symmetry. After he was arriv'd to more Na∣tural years, his Father brought him up to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and enter'd him into the Society of <HI>Grayes</HI>-Inn, where he not so much design'd him for a profound Lawyer, as to be Capable to serve his Country in that Station and Quality he was born in. For the first two years he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> observ'd by all, for a Sedulous Student, and knew no other pleasures or diversions of the Town, then those of the play-House or Dancing-School, both which he rarely frequented, and then ra∣ther out of Complaisance to his Friends then Inclination in himself. It fortun'd one day he was Invited abroad by some of his acquaintance to an Entertainment of the Spring-Gardens, where they were Engag'd to Meet some Ladies, to whom the last Night they had lost a Collati∣on at a Game at C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds. <HI>Charilus</HI> who knew nothing of the design, was very ready to accept the Treat, and promis d his Company, The
<PB N="75" REF="43"/> Gentlemen and Ladies met accordingly, the En∣tertainment was Noble and Costly, the Gentle∣men Generous and Frank, and the Ladies fair and Obliging. <HI>Charilus</HI> whose heart was yet a st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an∣ger to Love, began of a sudden to feel its war∣mer powers, and himself discompos'd that he resolv'd all happiness into that of Love, and Condemned the ignorance of his past Life, who had only Studyed Men and Books to know the worst half of Mankind, and neglected the faire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sex, the Beauty and Glory of the whole Creati∣on. Having thus but dipt his Foot in the water he found it so refreshing he resolv'd to wade farther and plunge himself into that Abyss of pleasures his Thirsty Soul so eagerly Coveted. These Ladies brought him into the Acquain∣tance of others, which they inlarg'd to their own Friends, till in a short time the day was not long enough for him to pay his Visits (which he punctually observ'd) to each expecting Mistress. About this time his Father dyed and left him a plent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>full Estate with a considerable Sum of ready Money, which he improv'd to the better Conduct and more easy Management of his Amorous Intrigues, Numerous were the Fe∣male Clients of this young Lawyer, and the rather because he gave, but receiv'd no Fees, except those in Tail, besides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he great ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an∣tage
<PB N="76" REF="44"/> he had of other Gentlemen in his comely personage and courteous behaviour, that he wounded more hearts in a week then he could Cure in a Month with his best perfor∣mances.

But after several Visits made with all passion and diligence as the Devil would have it, <HI>Bellinda</HI> prov'd of a different mould from other Ladies of her Sex, and Vertue had been Regent at her Nativity, above Beauty or pleasure. <HI>Charilus</HI> who had never met a re∣pulse like this in the whole Career of his hot desires; Intreated, Treated, presented, which the Lady still accepted upon honourable terms. When he found these Bait<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would not take, he offer'd Marriage as the last and most prevailing ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ument.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="44"/>
<P><HI>Bellinda</HI> told him, <HI>She was under no Vow to a single Life, but could dispose of her Person and Fortune as best pleas'd her self.</HI></P>
<P>Charilus <HI>told her that was the only hap∣piness he aim'd at, and would compleat im∣mediately, but that he was under a Sacred Obligation not to Marry for some time which was now Expired to Six Months, that he did believe a contract in the Eye of Heaven, was as Obliging as the publick Solemniza∣tion of the Wedding, which was only re∣quir'd by Law for the more known and cer∣tain descent of Estates, that if she pleas'd to consent to a Contract now he would m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st assuredly Consummate the Marriage Six Months after.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Charilus</HI> having fixt this point, and seen <HI>Bellinda</HI> placed at a Merchants House, (where she had the Reputation of a Fortune of Eight Thousand pounds a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d five Hundred <HI>li. per An.</HI>) and made some Visits to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, he went down in∣to the Country where his Uncle receiv'd him as a Gentleman and a stranger, of whom he had not heard a word this seven years, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as Com∣mon fame reported him to his disadvantage.

After other reasonings on both sides the Uncle seem'd to be satisfied with. <HI>Charilus</HI> his discourse of the fortune, and told him that if he would stay with him till Term which was not long, he would consider farther of it, and then he had buisness at <HI>London.</HI> During his stay in the Country, he wrote two Letters to <HI>Bellinda,</HI> which he Show'd

At the door he met with one of <HI>Bellinda'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Maids, and ask'd if her Lady was within, who Answered, yes, pray Sweet heart, sayes he</P>

<P><HI>Sir, my Lady presents her Service to you, She's something indispos'd at this time and begs your pardon.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which <HI>Charilus</HI> and his Uncle return'd

And told <HI>Charilus,</HI> this was a Sort of a cold indifferent Complement, which he excus'd, that Ladies of that quality and fortune did of∣ten put on State to give a greater value and Esteem to their Character. However the Un∣cle was much disatisfied to see his Nephew thus Slighted and urg'd, that they should make a Second Visit by Nine next Morning, which he Excus'd as not the Mode of the Town to Visit Ladies, but in the Afternoon. Next day he was Impatient till the Clock had struck Three, that he might have a Sight of this Lady, after thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they made a Second attempt to a V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sent up the same Message as before, but the Un∣cle for fear of some excuse pull'd <HI>Charilus</HI> by the Sleeve and followed the Servant up stairs, where they met her returning to Invite them up. At th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir entrance into the Dining Room, they saw the Lady at the Table talking with a Gen∣tleman, and a great heap of writings and parch∣ments before them, upon which <HI>Charilus</HI> step<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> back, but the Lady very familiarly call'd him in, and desir'd his Friend would please to walk in too, which Invitation the Uncle had already prevented out of his great Curiosity to see the Lady; <HI>Charilus</HI> saluted her with all imaginable respect and ask'd pardon for interrupting of
<PB N="86" REF="49"/> her in the midst of Buisness. She answer'd, it was no great Buisness, this Gentleman was her Lawyer, and they had been looking over some loose papers, at which she turn'd the Carpet gently over them, and told the Gentleman if he pleas'd to come at Ten in the Morning they would Inspect the rest, upon which he took his Ieave. Then she particularly apolog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z'd for yesterdays rudeness as she pleased to call it, that indeed she had been busie all day wi h her Law∣yer, was undrest, and understanding there was a stranger with you Sir, to <HI>Charilus,</HI> I was forc't to use the frequent exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of our Sex, which I beg this Gentlemans pardon for — to the Uncle, which Complement after he had taken care to Answer — She invited them to sit down, and put on a most facetious and obliging Countenance. Amongst other discourse <HI>Charilus</HI> ask'd if the Painter had finished her Ladyships Picture yet, yes Sir, sayes she, it hangs in the withdrawing Room — and rising up, pray Sir, sayes she, give me your Opinion, whether it is like or No, with that <HI>Charilus</HI> waited upon her into the Room, and the Uncle (thinking it but common manners to let the Lovers be pri∣vate at their first Enterview after so long a Va∣cation) stayed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehind; <HI>Charilus</HI> gently putting the door too, which the Uncle observing b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gan
<PB N="87" REF="49"/> to peep under the Carpet, wh re he saw several Bonds, Letters, and one Mortgage for four Thousand pounds. After half an Hours stay the Lovers return'd, and the Lady afresh ex∣cused the incivility of her absence, to a Gen∣tleman of his quality, whom she now under∣stood to be a near Relation to this Worthy Gentleman her Friend; Mutual Complements having pass'd between the Uncle and Lady they sat down, and fell upon other discourses. After half an Hours stay longer <HI>Charilus</HI> and his Un∣cle took leave of the Lady, and in the next street parted; his Uncle telling him he would make a particular Enquiry for his own Satisfaction, and within two dayes he would resolve him what he would do. Two days after he came early into his Chamber with a Letter in his Hand and told him he had weigh'd all Circum∣stances of Truth and improbability, had made a most particular Scrutiny into the Ladies for∣tune, her Relations, and whatever was to be consider'd upon that point, and did agree with him, that she was a most Beautifull Vertuous Lady and Mistress of the same Estate in Money and Land (if not more) as he first reported to him. That he was withall very sensible that she had more than ordinary Ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect for him by those familiar kindnesses she Expressed, that de∣lay
<PB N="88" REF="50"/> was the greatest Enemy he could have in this affair, and whatever was resolv'd must be with Expedition. I do withall think it proper, sayes he, you should make her some Handsom present as either a Locket of Diamonds, a fair Necklace of Pearl, or what you think is most Modish and acceptable, Sir, says <HI>Charilus,</HI> I humbly thank you, you certainly advise the best Method that can be; yes, says the Uncle, interru∣pting of him, and you ought likewise to appear in a fine Gilt Chariot drawn by two <HI>Flanders,</HI> these are very taking with Young Ladies, they were so in my time, yes Sir, sayes <HI>Charilus,</HI> but my present Stock of Money will not reach so far, and I am unwilling to run in debt to Tradesmen it may prove a disadvantage to me, if known, you are in the right says his Uncle, and I did fear as much, and for that reason I have here writ a Letter to <HI>Badley</HI> my Steward, to furnish you with Eight Hundred, or a Thousand pounds▪ which you would rather have, and do you take it, and go down into the Country with all speed, if he has not so much in his Hands let him raise it of the Tenants, but I expect, Nephew, you shall return it to me Six Months after Marriage: which <HI>Charilus</HI> submissively promis'd to do, and to take Post immediately into the Country. <HI>Charilus</HI> overjoy'd at this great
<PB N="89" REF="50"/> Blessing of fortune beyond his utmost Expecta∣tion, Stole a Visit first to <HI>Bellinda,</HI> and told her all his Uncle had said, shewed the Letter, and after they had Congratulated each other in this happy Success, took leave for the Countrey pro∣mising all speed in his return. In the Afternoon the Uncle made a Visit to the Lady, and talking Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osely of Marriage, made his address to her, &amp; told her, if she could comply with a little dispro∣portion of Age, no Person had more Vigorous Flames, or a more passionate affection to her Service then himself, that as for his Nephew, to whom he believ'd she had some respect, he was a wild Extravagant Young Man, that he who had already ruin'd his own fortune, would be unsafely trusted with anothers, and an Empire in the Cup of a Voluptuary would be assoon quaft of, as that Narrow Spot left by paternal care, which his Riotous humour had already Spent, and yet not quench'd his Thirst. The Lady was very much Surpriz'd at his discourse, and told him she rather expected he would have been an Advocate in his Nephews behalf, then have Furnish'd her with such powerfull Argu∣ments o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disesteem. The Uncle made his Attaqus so close and quick, that she began seriously to consider of her own Circumstances, and at last told him, it was a matter of so great Moment he
<PB N="90" REF="51"/> could not reasonably expect a present Answer. After some other discourses to the same purpose the Uncle took his leave, prom sing to wait u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on her the next day. Upon the Second visit he pre∣sented her with a Necklace of Pearl, and a Gold Watch studded with diamonds, which he beg'd of her to accept, and in the close of all told her he had a clear Estate of a Thousand pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> besides Mony abroad, that he would settle Six Hundred pounds a year in Joynture, and what more she pleas'd of her own fortune. The Lady thank'd him for his great Respects to her, and those Generous offers he was pleas'd to make, that was she determined, as she was yet no wayes inclin'd to Marry; She should En∣tertain as worthy and deserving thoughts of himself as of any other Gentleman in <HI>England.</HI> The Esquire, for to that Title his Character is now grown up, looking upon this last Answer to be as absolute a Surrender as would Consist with her Modesty, told her that from the first Minute he had the happiness to see her, he was struck with Love and admiration, that he de∣signedly sent his Nephew into the Country upon an <HI>April</HI> Errand, that he might have the freer access to her Person, and then earnestly prest the Wedding might be over before his return.</P>
<PB N="91" REF="51"/>
<P>At last She told him, <HI>within two dayes He should have the Result of her more seri∣ous Consideration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inda</HI> was now more pos'd then ever which way to Steer, the Uncles great kind∣ness to <HI>Char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lus</HI> was but Counterfeit, but to her reall, that it was much better to save one, then that they both should perish, nay, this might pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rve both for upon this Marriage she hop'd to be in a Condition to serve him; Nor was she so much too blame who had been ruin'd by one Branch of the Family, if she prudently En∣deavour'd her safety by another, and the Un∣cle repair those Breaches the Nephew had made, Thus she ponder'd the Morning before she expected his return, and at last resolv'd to Marry him, but first secure the Joynture. In the Afternoon came the Esquire, and after a Cun∣ning Harangue of reason all in his own Com∣mendation why she should Marry him, she decla∣red her consent, That as to matter of Joynture, She was well satisfied with the six Hundred pounds a year at present, and what part of her own fortune he would put into her Hands, should be as he pleas'd at his own time. Thus the Bargain was made, and her Lawyer who was prepar'd before Hand, sent for and order'd to make the Joynture upon such particulars and to be ready upon <HI>Thursday</HI> Morning by Eight,
<PB N="92" REF="52"/> when the Joynture was Seal'd and the Espousals Consummated. <HI>Charilus</HI> came late to Town the same Night to his Uncles Lodgings, with a return of Eight Hundred pounds, and waiting his coming in till it grew late, went to Bed, in the Morning early he ask'd what time his Uncle came in, and if he was yet stirring. The Servant told him he did not come in all Night, nor had he seen or heard from him since he last went out the Morning befor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Charilus</HI> was very much troubled at this, fearing some Misfortune had befallen him (which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s true enough, tho' not in his Sense) but not knowing where rea∣dily to find him, he went first to give <HI>Bellinda</HI> a Visit, and acquaint her w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the Joyfull News of the Eight Hundred pounds, when off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring to go into the Bed-Chamber her Maid would have stopped him, which be took little Notice of, but prest in, and saw some Body in Bed with the Lady, Upon which in the greatest rage and fury he drew his Sword, and Swore he would be the death of that Villain who had thus abus'd him. The Uncle crept under the sheet for fear expecting the Sword either in his heart or Guts at each Oath he Swore, <HI>Bellinda</HI> was strange∣ly Surpriz'd, and Shriek'd out for help, whilst <HI>Charilus</HI> discharg'd whole Valleys of Oaths and Curses on those two miserable Wretches, and
<PB N="93" REF="52"/> violently pulling down the Cloaths, discovered his own Dear Uncle in B d with his Mistress. <HI>Charilus</HI> at this was no less astonished, then th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y affrighted, when <HI>Bellinda</HI> interp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s'd, and de∣sired his patience but for two words; Sir, says she, I beseech you Compose your self, and be not angry with this Gentleman or my self, for we are Man and Wife. This was so amazing a Story he did not know what to answer to it, but after a little pause, considering it as a truth, there might be a good improvement made of it, he fell into a violent passion with his Uncle, call'd him all the infamous Names he could invent, and with the point of his Sword threatned immediate Vengeance upon that false Heart, which had so basely and Treacherously supplanted him, After his passion was grown more cool, the Uncle offered terms of reconci∣liation, and acknowledged the hainousness of his crime in betraying that trust he had repos'd in him and Robbing him of a Mistress of so considerable a Fortune, for all which he was ready to make present Satisfaction. The terms agreed upon were these, that <HI>Charilus</HI> should have the Eight Hundred pounds now in his Hands, and his Uncle make over to him four Hundred pounds a year out of his Estate, and put him into immediate possession of it,
<PB N="94" REF="53"/> in consideration of the Injury he had done him in the loss of his Mistress, all which the Uncle perform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that day according to the Tenor of the Articles. Within a Month after he disco∣ver'd some part of his own Errour, as to the mistake of the Fortune, but nothing farther, however they went down into <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> toge∣ther, where in less then a Twelve-Month he dyed, and <HI>Bellinda</HI>'s Joynture being an En∣tail'd Estate came into <HI>Charilus</HI> his Hands, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Memory of former kindnesses was highly Ge∣nerous and Noble to her.</P>
<P><HI>Here Sir, sayes</HI> Florimel, <HI>should I con∣clude with my Story, but that I have some∣thing to say by way of Consolation to you</HI> Melintus, <HI>and therefore beg leave to carry on</HI> Bellinda's <HI>Character one step farther.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Lady Sir, after the death of her Husband came up to</HI> London, <HI>and 'tho she had for some years of her acquaintance with</HI> Charilus <HI>resided here, yet was she seldom abroad, and not at all known to the Gallants of the Town, so that upon her return she pass'd for a New Face, and was generally thought to be a Maid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amongst other Sparks who made search up and down for fresh Beauties, that
<PB N="95" REF="53"/> Matchless piece of Chivalry, Sir — was one, you all know, who was the Per∣son that first discover'd that Notable way of affronting Ladies of Quality by breaking their Windowes with Crown pieces; It was his fortune to Meet with this Lady and after some necessary Treats to intro∣duce a more familiar acquaintance, he fell Smart upon her, but all in vain, her Honour was Lodg'd in an impregnable Fortress; when that would not do, he betook himself to his last Remedy, Marriage; Offer'd a fair Joynture and whatever else should be thought convenient, this at last was appro∣ved of, but the Knight was mistaken in his Measures she would yeild up no part of the premises till the Joynture was Seal'd, and the Marriage compleated; which, rather then lose his longing he consented to. A short time after the Wedding, he ask'd her what reason she imagin'd more particularly In∣fluenced him to Love her, when she could not Guess, he told her, it was for her strict Vertue and Chastity, for he had made a Re∣solution never to Marry any whom he could
<PB N="96" REF="54"/> prevail upon without it, and that is the reason that tho' I have Courted Hundreds I was never Married till now; Why look you Sir sayes she, I had that Trick put upon me once too, but I was resolv'd I would never be Catch'd Twice with the same Bait.</HI></P>

<HEAD>NOVEL the Fifth,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PARMENIO.</BYLINE>
<P>A Gentleman who had been formerly a Mer∣chant in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and acquir'd a considerable Estate, withdrew into the Coun∣try, having Spent his younger years in the Noise and hurry of Business, resolved now to enjoy the fruits of his Labours in quiet, and Gratifie himself with Solitude and Retirement; having a fair House in <HI>Hartfords<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire</HI> he in∣clined to fix there, where he was eminently hos∣pitable to the Gentry, and Charitable to the poor. But that he might not be out of all con∣cern of business in the world like an idle pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son, he still kept some Ventures a broad, which he called the poors Stock, in which and all other his endeavours, providence blest his Industry with that constant success, that he used famili∣arly
<PB N="98" REF="55"/> to say he grew Rich in spight of his Teeth, for if he shut Money out at the door, it would come in at the Window. This Gentleman at his death left only one Child a Daughter call'd <HI>Joanna,</HI> to whom he gave a very great Fortune, and committed the care of her Person and ma∣nagement of her Estate to two Gentlemen her Guardians. She was now about Eight years old when she desir'd she might (as she usually did once a year) go see her Uncle, a Gentleman of fair Reputation and good Estate in <HI>Ess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x,</HI> which they granted, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt her over attended with two Servants. After she had been there a Month, her Uncle wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was a passionate Man, catching her in some fault threatned to whip her; She farther provoking him with some Scurvy reply, he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d so, at which time as she cryed out, was heard to say by some of the Neighbours, <HI>O pray Ʋncle don't kill Me,</HI> which neither he or any of the Family took much No∣tice of at that time. The next Morning early she stole out of the House, and after she had wander'd some Hours not knowing whether to go, met with a Company of <HI>Gipsies</HI> who took her up, made much of her, changing her Cloths and staining her C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mplexion, brought her with them in few dayes to <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don,</HI> and from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce went their Rounds into <HI>Hampsh re,
<PB N="99" REF="55"/> Wiltshire,</HI> and about the Country. The Uncle missing his Neece next day, made all possible Enquiry after her, sent to all the Neighbouring Villages, search'd all the publick Roads, but could not receive any account of her. He next sent into <HI>Hartfordshire</HI> to her Guardians to know if she was return'd home, but meeting with no satisfaction, concluded that some young Gentleman who knew she would be a great for∣tune had Stole her, and carried her far away to some distant County where she lay conceal'd. This the Guardians believed too, till some of the Neighbors at their Gossipping, were prat∣ling what they heard others say, and began to wish seriously that it was not too true, esp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cial∣ly when they consider'd that if the Child dyed in her Minority, the whole Estate would de∣scend to the Uncle. This was buzz'd about till at last it reach'd the Guardians Ears, who making more particular enquiry into the truth of it, were inform'd by some of the Neighbours that the Night before the Child was missing, they heard her cry out most lamentably, <HI>pray Ʋncle don't kill Me,</HI> this they considered as an odd Circu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stance to happen just the Night be∣fore, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> asked the Persons who thus informed, if they could safely take their Oaths of it, and would do so before a Magistrate, who said, yes,
<PB N="100" REF="56"/> it was all true and nothing but the truth. After some delibe atio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they acquainted the Uncle what the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ghb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs said, and how nearly it did touch his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>putation now, and might his Life hereafter, if his Neece was not found. He told them he was altogether innocent of any Injury done to her, nor did he remember that ever she sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d so, tho' he own'd he whipt her se∣verely▪ which was for telling a notorious Lye, and using some other indecent expressions, which he thought she deserved to be Corrected for. Upon this all the ponds and Rivers were search'd, and a considerable reward promis'd to any Person, who could give an account of her alive or dead. No News being heard of her, the Neighbours b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gan to Grumble and said, that the Guardians and Uncle had Com∣plotted to Murder the Child and Share her E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tate: This being now grown a publick dis∣course in the Country to the great disadvantage of their Reputation, who before were Esteem'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gentlemen of Honour and integrity; They reso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved to probe the bottom of this cause, and prosecute the Uncle as far as the Law directed them. Accordingly they went over into <HI>Essex,</HI> and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for him to a Gentlemans House who was his Neighbour, and a Justice of the peace. Being altogether, the Guardians complain'd
<PB N="101" REF="56"/> to the Justice of this report, and desir'd him that he would take Cognizance of it as far as the Law required, that if possible their Reputati∣ons, and the Gentlemans might be preserve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> free from such an undeserved calumny. The Justice sent for the witnesses, who Swore positively that on such a Night, which was the immediate Night before she was missing, they heard her cry out with a lamentable voice, <HI>pray Ʋncle don't kill Me.</HI> Upon which the Justice bound the Uncle in a Recognizance of two Thousand pounds to appear at the next Assize, and the Guardians in a bond of five Hundred to prose∣cute the Uncle. In this Interval the Uncle ha∣ving used all the probable means for a discove∣ry that humane Wit could imagine, but not be∣ing able to make any, began to think what was to be done, the time of the Assize drew on, and then he should certainly be Indicted for the Murder of <HI>Joanna,</HI> nor had he any way to clear his Innocence against such Circumstantial E∣vidence, but by a down-right Negation, which though some of his Friends might Credit, would yet take no place in a Court of Judicature. Ha∣ving thus considered the difficulty of his Case, he at last resolved thus. In his search after <HI>Jo∣anna,</HI> he had found a poor Mans Daughter in another County, who both in Age, Features▪
<PB N="102" REF="57"/> and Complexion, so much resembled her that at first sight he thought she had been the real same, now sayes he to himself, if I can get this Girle of her Parents, and dress her up in the same ha∣bit, <HI>Joanna</HI> wore, the very Guardians shall not distinguish her from their own Pupil, she will appear so like the very same, nor have I any other course but this to preserve my self, he accordingly did so, and for a Sum of Money bought the Girl of her poor Relations, dili∣gently instructed her in the part she was to act, who being of a ripe Wit and very apprehensive had her Lesson to a hair. A day or two before the Assize, he gave out he had by great fortune found his Neece, brings her home to his House with her real Father and Mother, who gave a Satisfactory account to all persons how acci∣dently they found her in a wood almost Starv'd, and She not remembring from whence She had wandred they Entertained her amongst their own Children. The Girl own'd how she Stole away for fear her Uncle should whip her again as he threatned, all which Romance hung so well together, that the Guardians believ'd her the same, and no body question'd the truth. At the Assize he was calld to appear which accord∣ingly he did, the Judge asked him for his Neece <HI>Joanna</HI> if she was found yet, <HI>Yes, my Lord,</HI> sayes
<PB N="103" REF="57"/> the Gentleman, she is in Court, <HI>Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y well,</HI> sayes my Lord, <HI>produce her, and bid the Guardians appear,</HI> accordingly they did, and the Counter∣feit <HI>Joanna, Are you satisfied,</HI> to the Guardians sayes the Judge, <HI>that this is your Pupil, the Daughter of Mr. — with whom you were left in trust? Yes, my Lord,</HI> said the Guardians, After a farther account how she was found the Judge order'd their Recognizance should be withdrawn, and the Uncle discharged. It hap∣pened that an old Woman who was in Court about other business, hearing what a Bustle had been made about her young Mistress, and that she was found again, as they came out of Court crowded to see her, and looking full up∣on her, believed it to be the same, but the Girl not taking Notice of her, She cryed out, <HI>O Mistress you don't know Me,</HI> upon which She answer'd presently, no, what sayes She, don't you know old Nurse? I am sure you are not the same then, upon this the Girl was startled, the Guardians made a stop and asked her how she came to forget Nurse so soon, she not give∣ing a present answer, they began to suspect something and brought her again into Court and Nurse with her.</P>
<P>The old Woman said, <HI>She did believe
<PB N="104" REF="58"/> it had been the same at first, but upon re∣view she much question'd it, that she her self had Nurst her till she was almost four years old, and if it was her Mistress she had a Scar upon her left Arm above the Elbow.</HI></P>
<P>The Judge ordered they should look upon her Arm, which they did, and reported there was no Scar above but one below the Elbow, upon this it was generally believ'd she was the lame, and all things set right again. However the Judge seem'd more disatisfied then be∣fore, ordered the Uncle to withdraw, and examined the Girl, Afterwards the Man apart, who said he had found her in a Wood, and then the woman, and here he found they all disagreed in one point or other, at length by crossing the account of the Man and Wife, and then considering that both the Guar∣dians and Nurse agreed the true <HI>Joanna,</HI> must needs have remembred her Nurse, since it was not a Twelve-Month ago since she saw and par∣ticularly knew her, they agreed it was yet a Cheat, which the Woman for fear of punish∣ment, first Confest, and then her husband own'd it, and lastly the Girl; They proved the Receit of so much Money at such a time, proved by several neighbours, who had known this Girl
<PB N="105" REF="58"/> for five or six years together, that she alwayes was look'd upon and reputed as their own Child and alwayes liv'd with them. Upon this dis∣covery an Indictment was preferr'd against the Uncle, for the Murder of his Neece <HI>Joanna,</HI> but he having no proof to clear himself by, and this appearing with so foul a Face against him, he was Condemn'd to be hang'd, and was within a Week after Executed. It fortuned about nine years after at the Summer Assize at <HI>Notting∣ham,</HI> two young G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntlemen who were lately call'd to the Bar, whereof the Judges Son was one, walking out early one Morning in the fields they saw a whole Covie of Gipsies under a Hedge, when they came near, two of them stept out, and in their Cant told them a great deal of good fortune by looking into their Hands, and viewing the lines of the Face as they pre∣tend, upon which one Gentleman threw them a Shilling, the other call'd them idle Whores, and said they deserv'd to be whipt for publick Cheats, upon which one of them a tall black Girl told him, he ought not to despise a Gipsie for he should Marry one before he was Three Months older, at this the Gentlemen fell a laughing and entertain'd them with other lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> discourse; when they came home one of them mist his gold Watch, and another had lost all
<PB N="106" REF="59"/> his Money. They began to grow angry to be thus Cheated, and getting a Constable very luckily, met with these two going off another way; They charg'd them with the Watch and Money, which they as peremptorily denyed, upon which the Constable brought them along into open Court which was then sitting, upon Examination they denyed the Fact, nor could they upon search find either about them. How∣ever, the Judge ordered them to be soundly lash'd for Vagrants, and sent out of Town, as the Constable was taking them away, the Gen∣tleman who was the Judges Son, call'd out Jo∣cosely to the Constable, pray favour the black-woman, for she tells me, I shall Marry a Gipsie within these three Months; which his Father overhearing call'd them back again, and ask'd them▪</P>
<P><HI>How long they had pretended to telling of Fortunes, I had thought,</HI> sayes the Judge, <HI>all your Trade had been Picking of Pockets; No,</HI> and please you my Lord sayes the black-Woman, <HI>my profession is only tel∣ling of Fortunes, I never understood nor practised such unlawfull Arts,</HI> at which the Court laugh'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> My Lord then
<PB N="107" REF="59"/> ask'd (seeing her a good favour'd young Woman, and so quick in her Answers) <HI>what Country-Woman she was,</HI> to which she said, <HI>she thought</HI> Hartfordshire. Then he askt, <HI>if she was born a Gipsy;</HI> She said <HI>No, but She was as good, for She had been Nine years Apprentice to a Gipsy.</HI> At which he ask'd her, <HI>if she had e're a Christian Name, yes, my Lord,</HI> sayes she, <HI>I think so, for my Name is</HI> Joanna, the Judge hearing the Name <HI>Joanna</HI> recol∣lected himself, and remembred the Sto∣ry of the <HI>Essex</HI> Gentleman, who was by him Condemn'd for Murdering his Neece of that Name. He then asked her, <HI>if she had ever been in</HI> Essex, <HI>or had any Re∣lations there;</HI> She said, <HI>not since she was very Young, which was at the time she met with the Gipsys first, and then She had an Ʋncle there, who used her very hardly, and so she ran away from him, and was never there since, nor never Enquired after him.</HI> Upon this he concluded her to be the same Person, and call'd to the Con∣stable
<PB N="108" REF="60"/> and told him, he should not let them be whipt, but carry them home to his own House and Entertain them there, till the Court was up, and then he should receive farther Orders. The whole Court at this began to Wonder, and believe one or both of them to be Gentlewomen of good Families, nor did they spare telling the young Gentleman <HI>that for ought they knew it might be his Fortune indeed to Marry a Gipsy, if this Young Woman should prove to be a Person of Quality and Estate,</HI> which fell out even so, for the Assizes being over, the Judge who had a Seat in <HI>Hartfordshire,</HI> and had known her Father formerly, brought her up in his Coach, and presented her to the Guardians who own'd her to be the same Person, which the Nurse and all her Surviving Relations Confirm'd. At the same time his Lordship, who knew her to be a very great Fortune, propos'd a Match between his Son and her which she Franckly consented to,
<PB N="109" REF="60"/> and was presently after Solemniz'd.</P>
<Q><P>Thus ended <HI>Parmenio</HI> when the whole Company Bow'd their respects, and were all extreamly ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with the fortune of the Gipsy, <HI>But Sir,</HI> sayes Melintus, <HI>I could have wish'd you had carried a lighter Hand over the hard fate of the Ʋncle, whom I pity with all my Heart.

<BYLINE><HI>By</HI> EVADNE.</BYLINE>
<P><HI>ORithia</HI> the Beauty of her Sex and Glory of her Age, was the Daugh∣ter of an English Earl, of an Antient Family, whose Noble Acts in Chivalry stands first upon Record in our most ear∣ly Histories, Her great Wit and Excel∣lent Sweetness of Temper obliged all who had the Honour of her Acquain∣tance, which every Gentleman both Courted, and admir'd. And if amongst those Thousands who were ready to Sa∣crifice their bleeding hearts to the fair <HI>Orithia,</HI> any was thought to have a more particular interest in her Favour, it was the Lovely <HI>Philanthus,</HI> who was only
<PB N="111" REF="61"/> able to make a Reprisall of Hearts amongst the Ladies, for those <HI>Orithia</HI> Captivated from the Men. <HI>Philanthus</HI> his Family was somewhat inferiour, but much more Opulent, he being the El∣dest Branch of it, who for the great Ser∣vice of his Father, (who lost his Life in the Wars against the <HI>French</HI>) had the Honour of Knight-hood Confer'd up∣on him, whilst yet a School-boy, by his Gracious Prince. The Assiduous Ad∣dress of <HI>Philanthus,</HI> his kind Reception, and more intimate familiarity oblig'd us all to believe he would be that happy Conquerour, who should carry off this Noble prize from the Rest of the des∣pairing world. But amongst those Stars which influence the great affairs of Love, some are kind and propitious, whilst others infect their good intents by their poysonous Neighbourhood, some such unhappy Conjunction there was which suddenly blasted <HI>Philanthus</HI> his blooming hopes, rob'd him of all his
<PB N="112" REF="62"/> Glorious Expectations and left him the Pity or the Scorn of his Rivals.</P>
<P>The <HI>Count de Montallo</HI> who was Ambassadour from the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> at the English Court, being shortly to return, and having often admired the Beautifull <HI>Orithia,</HI> as the most lovely Creature his Eyes yet beheld, made his private Addresses to her, and without the knowledge or Consent of her Re∣lations was Married to her.</P>
<P>My Lord, her Father, and all her Friends were extreamly concern'd at it, there not being any but who gave <HI>Phi∣lanthus</HI> the Encouragement to hope he should be that happy Person, nor had he any reason to question <HI>Orithia's</HI> Fa∣vour, till the Count made his applicati∣ons, and then the Ambition of being so great a Countess soon prevail'd over the more easy powers of Love. Within four days after, <HI>Orithia</HI> went along with the Count her Husband for <HI>Savoy,</HI> with∣out seeing or taking leave of any of her
<PB N="113" REF="62"/> Friends or Relations. This sudden Mar∣riage with the Count had at first ex∣treamly incensed my Lord her Father, but considering she had Honourably disposed her self, without the Charge of a weighty portion, which his Circum∣stances could not so conveniently spare, he now called that prudence and discretion, which before he thought a rash and inconsiderable Action. After her Arrival at <HI>Savoy,</HI> for three years she liv'd as happy &amp; as great as heart could wish, the Count her Husband lov'd her above all the World, and his Estate, which was very considerable, was abso∣lutely at her Command. No Empress, tho' she might have more large Domi∣nions, was better belov'd, or more wil∣lingly obeyed then she was. It happened that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> making Wars upon some of the Neighbouring Princes appointed the <HI>Count de Montallo</HI> Gene∣ral of his Army, which was an Honour he could not refuse, though with some
<PB N="114" REF="63"/> regret he parted from the Arms of his beloved <HI>Orithia.</HI> That he might leave the affairs of his Family under the better Government, he appointed three of his Friends as Commissioners to take an account of his Rents, assist the Countess upon all occasion with their Advice, and manage all his business to his great∣est advantage and reputation. To these he added one more, who was the honest <HI>Sabrino</HI> as he used to call him, a Gentleman of some Relation to the Count, but his intimate Friend and Confident. The Duke being now with his Army, and not expected back till a peace was concluded, which was yet but uncertainly discours'd; <HI>Sabrino,</HI> who had the largest Commission of any of the rest, and much more respected, considered that this was the only oppor∣tunity his heart could wish for, to com∣pleat those desires he had so long lan∣guished under. Accordingly one day coming up to the Countess, as if upon
<PB N="115" REF="63"/> some Urgent business, he found her alone in her Closet, where without any regard to the Honour of the Count, the Vertue of the Lady, which he had no reason to suspect, or to the Modesty and good manners in himself, of which he ought to have had some share, he dis∣cover'd his unlawfull passion, which she received with that abhorrence and de∣testation that he was well assured he was now undone for ever, if he did not pre∣serve himself by being the first Accuser, tho' he had nothing to Charge the spot∣less <HI>Orithia</HI> with, but what was false as Hell or Devils could invent. However envenom'd malice will want neither Instruments or Methods to perfect its Revenge; tho' what wrong had <HI>Sabrino</HI> received? He first gives the affront, and then demands Satisfaction, and first Tempts the Lady with his lascivious address<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, then calls himself injur'd, so great a Crime is it to be good and Vertuous in the prospect of those who
<PB N="116" REF="64"/> are wicked and debauch'd. <HI>Sabrino,</HI> that he might lose no opportunity, sent pre∣sently to the three Commissioners to meet him at his own Chamber, where he told them,</P>
<P><HI>He had a secret of that importance to communicate to them and of that strange Surprize, that he wanted words to express the present Horrour of his thoughts; I have for some time suspected, and I wish I could say I did yet but suspect, Oh shall I speak it! The Fidelity and Chastity of the Coun∣tess</HI>— upon which one of them told him, Sir, I will as soon beleive, the Glorious Cherubins may be tainted in their pure Angelic Natures, as that any Temptati∣on of dishonesty hath or ever shall assoil the Vertue of that immaculate Lady. <HI>Oh Sir, sayes</HI> Sabrino, <HI>be not too forward I once thought so too, but I am afraid I shall be able to convince you sooner then you or I could wish for. In the Interim pray make your own Observations, and let this pass no farther.</HI></P>
<PB N="117" REF="64"/>
<P><HI>Sabrino</HI> had a Nephew a proper young Gentleman, who had been Page to the <HI>Count</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and since his return, was prefer'd to be Gentleman Usher to the Countess; This Gentleman he sent for privately to his Chamber, and told him he understood what a particular kindness the Countess had for him, and that now was the time for him to make his fortunes in the absence of his Lord The young Gentleman told him he did not understand his meaning; O Nephew (said he) are you so short sighted, why the Countess is in love with you above all the World, and wants nothing but an opportunity, to compleat yours and her own happiness in Bed, which I have promised her this Night: Wherefore you must in the Evening pretend to go Sick to Bed, and then undress to you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gown, and Steal into the Countess's Chamber, and lye under the Bed till she gives you Notice to come forth, but be sure no Body sees you enter her
<PB N="118" REF="65"/> Chamber, if they do, make some excuse and go out again and so wait till you have an opportunity: pray Uncle, (sayes he young Gentleman) did the Countess her self bid you tell me thus? I, I, She her self bid me, and said that very sud∣denly she would make you Gentleman of the Horse The innocent Gentleman discovered not the Snares his Uncle had laid for him, but in the Evening accord∣ingly did so: after <HI>Sabrino</HI> had been at his Chamber and found him not there, nor about the House, he concluded he was then safe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Lodg'd under the Bed, and a little before the Countess went to her Chamber, sent for the Commissioners, and told them, <HI>he was inform'd that the Countess's Gallant was to be with her that Night, but who he was that he could not tell; Sabrino</HI> and the rest concluded to pre∣tend some extraordinary business, to be dispatched that Night and to desire to speak with her as soon as her Women had left her, and then if there was any
<PB N="119" REF="65"/> Gallant, they should certainly discover him, if not give the Countess no reason to suspect their design, Accordingly they did so, and coming softly up stairs knock'd at her Chamber door, an old Gentlewoman (who had formerly been her Nurse) lay in the Chamber with her and was going in to Bed, when she heard some Body knock at the Chamber door, She asked who was there, And their business, to which one of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣swered, we are the Commissioners and want to speak one word with her Ho∣nour upon Urgent business, which was forgot before, and must be dispatched this Night. She acquainted the Coun∣tess with what they said, who ordered her to let them in. As they were by her Bed-side discoursing with her, <HI>Sabrino</HI> cryes out, <HI>I, here he is, here's the Rogue, and pulls his Nephew by the heels from un∣der the Bed, and calling him Rogue, Villain and Traytor, to abuse so good a Lord,</HI> struck him through the heart with his Sword,
<PB N="120" REF="66"/> before he could speak one word to Vin∣dicate himself or his Ladies Honour. It was now in vain for the Countess to En∣deavour to purge her self from a Crime which appeared against her by so Noto∣rious an Evidence, tho' she did in the presence of several Worthy persons take the Sacrament upon it, that as she never had been Guilty against her Hus∣bands Bed, so she knew nothing of that Persons being there; that it was all the malicious Contrivance of <HI>Sabrino</HI> (whose unlawful desires she had refused with Scorn and contempt) that had now plot∣ted this Revenge to Rob her of her life and Honour at the same time. This some believ'd, who thought the Coun∣tess to be as uncorrupt as Vertue it self. But others said here's plain demonstrati∣on against her, and she who dares com∣mit Adultery, will not stick at a lye to defend her Guilt. The Commissio∣ners writ a Letter to the Count to ac∣quaint him with this unhappy News, in
<PB N="121" REF="66"/> which they gave a most particular ac∣count, and in the Close highly Com∣mended the Fidelity and Justice of <HI>Sa∣brino,</HI> who seeing his Honour abused, would not spare his nearest Relation. The Count was astonished at the News above any Misfortune that could have happened, and notwithstanding this de∣monstration, as they call'd it in their Letter, he put a greater Confidence in the Justice and integrity of the Coun∣tess, then in all their Solemn protestati∣ons. And as he sent them word</P>
<P><HI>He was extreamly troubled for the Countess <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat she should lye under so heavy an Aspersion, which if he did not believe the World would, and therefore with pray∣ers for her deliverance (if Innocent) did resign her up to the Law, so he should have been much better Satisfied in the Guilt of his Wife, if</HI> Sabrino <HI>had Spar'd his Kins∣mans Life, in that Transport of rage in which he kill'd him.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Receipt of this Letter the
<PB N="122" REF="67"/> Commissioners, (as the Custom is there) disposed the Countess into a Nunnery, where She is to continue a year and a day, and if in that time no Champion appears to justifie her Innocence against her Accuser, She is upon the last day brought into the List appointed for the Combatants (if there be any) and there burnt at a Stake, which death she Legally suffers if her Champion has the worst of it. The Countess was highly sensible of this as the greatest affliction that ever befell her, yet her own Innocence, and the Satisfaction that arose from thence made the distress much more easy and supportable. The Count was st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l En∣gag'd in the Wars, and the Countess had now been three quarters of a year a Pri∣soner in the Nunnery, and no Person ap∣pear'd in her behalf to Vindicate her Honour and Virtue. She now consider∣ed that the small remainder of her Life would soon be gone, and unless some Gentleman would Entertain such Ho∣nourable
<PB N="123" REF="67"/> thoughts of her, as to believe her Guiltless, and Engage his Life to preserve hers, she must certainly suffer, and as no Person had yet offer'd himself, so was she altogether at a loss where to find that Gallant Friend. At last amongst other English Gentlemen who had been formerly her Friends and Ac∣quaintance, She fixt upon <HI>Philanthus,</HI> but at the same time Corrected her Er∣rour in thinking that he who believed himself the most disobliged of all Man∣kind, should now hazard his Life to Vindicate her Reputation, No, certain∣ly he would be pleas'd to hear of her Mi∣series, and rejoyce to see her proud heart now humbled under the deepest afflicti∣ons, but on the other Hand considering him as a Gentleman, a Person of un∣questionable Courage and Gallantry, and one whose former affections were most sincerely devoted to her Service, he would rather Court such an opportunity to lay an everlasting obligation on her
<PB N="124" REF="68"/> which all her Treasury of thanks and Gratitude should be too poor to recom∣pence. And this took place in her re∣solution; Accordingly She writ a Let∣ter to <HI>Philanthus,</HI> and sent it by a Gentle∣man who had been formerly her Ser∣vant, with orders where to find or En∣quire for him at <HI>London,</HI> and to deliver him that Letter, receive his Answer, and return with all speed. <HI>Philanthus</HI> who had still the same respect and love for <HI>Orithia</HI> as would consist with Honour, having read the Letter, was extreamly troubled at it, but at the same time be∣ing Ruin'd himself in his Fortunes, his mind sunk under the load of miseries which opprest him, writ back a most passionate Letter of excuse, with wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch she was no less affected as well for his as her own sake. <HI>Orithia</HI> Spent her short time (which now wanted but a week of the fatal day) in recommending her Soul to Heaven, wholly despairing of any relief on Earth. <HI>Philanthus</HI> having
<PB N="125" REF="68"/> since seriously considered the present distress of the Countess, and that she must for ever suffer in her Memory, which to all Noble Spirits is Ten times worse then a Thousand deaths, and that though in his excuse to her he had not put his own interest or business into the Scale to ballance against her Life and Honour; But that strange and un∣expected disasters had reduced him to that mean degree of want that he was not able to Equip himself for the Ser∣vice; Yet this from a Generous Spirit was mean and pitifull, that however his Friends would not assist him here, he could want nothing there of Horse or Arms a <HI>Cavalier</HI> could ask. After he had ponder'd a while on this thought he went to a Gentleman of his intimate acquaintance, show'd him the Letter, and beg'd of him to furnish him with Moneys for that design which he did, and <HI>Philanthus</HI> a short time after went privately over to <HI>Savoy.</HI> Being arrived
<PB N="126" REF="69"/> at <HI>Turenne</HI> he Enquired at what N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnery the Countess <HI>de Montallo</HI> was, and what the general opinion were concerning her Guilt or Inn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cence; Understand∣ing the Nunnery wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thirty Miles from <HI>Turenne,</HI> and that all Persons spoke well of her &amp; did believe her falsely accused, he went directly thither. Being come within Four Miles of the Nunnery, by the side of a great Wood, he spyed a Hermits Cell, at which alighting, he ask'd of the Holy Father, <HI>what the dis∣course was about the Countess,</HI> he told him <HI>that in a fair Plain before the Nunnery, She was to suffer to Morrow Morning before Eleven of the Clock, if there was no Person f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d so hardy to fight her Accuser, nor did he yet hear of any Champion who had ap∣pear'd in her behalf.</HI> Upon which he told him, <HI>he had a very great desire to see her before she suffer'd, but he suppos'd it would b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very difficult to obtain that Favour un∣less he had on a Religious habit, and if he would do him that kindness to lend him his
<PB N="127" REF="69"/> Weeds, he would wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k over that Afternoon and return in the Evening, and leave his Horse and Armour there till he came back;</HI> the Herm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t very readily agreed to it, then <HI>Philanthus</HI> (who spoke <HI>Italian</HI> well) put on his Weeds, and in all Respects appear'd to be a grave Religious Hermit, having a long Beard and all things answerable. He was now Arriv'd at the Nunnery, and out of Respect to his habit (for Hermits are there had in great Veneration) was immediately conducted into the Countesses Cham∣ber, where entring, those Nunns who were attending upon her withdrew, that she might have the more freedom of dis∣course with this Religious Father. He stayed with her three Hours, and was as well satisfi'd of her Innocency and <HI>Sabrino's</HI> Roguery as his heart could wish. Asking her, <HI>if she had no hopes of any Friend to appear in the Lists to Morrow on her behalf,</HI> She said, <HI>No, She never sent but to One English Gentleman, and his Mis∣fortunes
<PB N="128" REF="70"/> happen'd at the same time to be al∣most as great as her own.</HI> When he took his leave of the Countess, she pull'd off a Diamond Ring from her Finger, and told him, <HI>Holy Father, I am oblig'd to you above what I am able to Express for your Prayers, and good Advice, I have nothing of Worldly Goods left Me to dispose of but this Ring, which was given Me by my Bro∣ther in</HI> England, <HI>a little before I Married into this Country, I pray accept it, and keep it for my sake.</HI> The Hermit receiv'd it with all Thankfulness, and taking his leave, burst out into tears to see so great a Beauty reduc'd to those thin meagre looks, and that Vertue of which she had so large a portion should be Triumph'd over by wickedness and Villainy. At parting the Countess shook him by the Hand and chearfully b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him not weep, this was the last day she could be mise∣rable. <HI>Philanthus</HI> return'd to the Cell where he again put on his own Habit, and told the Hermit what he thought of
<PB N="129" REF="70"/> the Innocency of the Countess. The next Morning at Nine of the Clock the Countess all in white, was brought from the Nunnery into a fair adjacent plain, in the middle of which was fixt a Stake, with a great deal of dryed Wood and other Combustible Matter. On a large Scaffold on one side was a Chair plac'd for the Countess, and at the other end a Tribunal Erected for those who were appointed to see the Execution per∣form'd, and if there should happen to be any Combatants, to determine any mat∣ter of difference that should arise. The Judges being Seated on the Tribunal and the Countess in the Chair, Procla∣mation was made, <HI>that if any Person would Venture to Wage War in defence of the Coun∣tess</HI> de Montallo's <HI>Innocency,</HI> Seignior Sabrino the Accuser <HI>was ready to Answer him at single Combat.</HI> Before this Procla∣mation was made, all the Drums, Trum∣pets, Clarions and Instruments of field Musick first sounded, &amp; then the principal
<PB N="130" REF="71"/> of the Judges gave order for the first Proclamation, and so for the Second, when being ready to give the last Sum∣mons, at a distance appear'd a Champion who by the waving of his Sword, gave Notice what he intended, he was Mount∣ed on a Milk white Courser in black Mourning Armour, his Beaver fast lock't down, his Device, the Sun Shining glori∣ously from a Cloud upon distressed Inno∣cence, which was a Virgin habited all in white. As soon as this strange Champion was Enter'd the Lists, a Herald demanded of him <HI>who he was that came thus Arm'd?</HI> he told him, <HI>he came to lose his Life or Vin∣dicate the Honour of the Countess of</HI> Mon∣tallo, <HI>who was unjustly accus'd by a Rogue a Lyar and a Vilain; and that he would prove him to be.</HI> Upon this the Herald demanded of the Countess, <HI>if she was willing to Venture her Life and Honour upon the Success of her Champion,</HI> to which she answer'd, <HI>yes, I pray God pros∣per him.</HI> Immediately after upon the
<PB N="131" REF="71"/> Sound of the Trumpets, the two War∣riours set Spurrs to their Horses, and in the first Career, the Ladies Champion had the worst, and lost one of his Stir∣rups, when recovering himself he re∣doubled that disadvantage upon his Enemy, having broke their Spears they fell to their Swords, when <HI>Philanthus</HI> lent him such a blow on the Helmet, that one half of it fell down upon his Shoul∣ders upon which followed whole streams of Blood; At this the whole Cirque (which consisted of Thousands of Spectators) gave a loud Shout, <HI>Sabrino</HI> being Cut deep into the Scull, and having lost a great quantity of Blood, in the middle of the next Course fell headlong from his Horse. <HI>Philanthus</HI> lept readily down and putting the point of his Sword to his Throat, bid him <HI>ask his Life, 'tis too late,</HI> sayes Sabrino, <HI>But I'le clear my Soul from all filthy Sin b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore I dye,</HI> Upon which a Confessor was call'd, to whom <HI>he publickly Confest his unjust Accusation
<PB N="132" REF="72"/> of the Countess, and the reason that put him upon such a Bloody Revenge, so long as he had Breath he call'd often upon her to for∣give him,</HI> which was not long, for his Wound was past Cure, and in less then half an Hour he dyed. I shall forbear to mention the loud shouts and acclamations of the people, for the Countesses deliverance, and that her Innocency was clear'd in the Face of the whole World; In the midst of all this Joy and Triumph, <HI>Philanthus</HI> stole pri∣vately away without being known by any Person who he was, and came over to <HI>England,</HI> where he never discover'd the least Syllable of what he had done to any of her own Relations.</P>
<P><HI>The Countess was now led back in Tri∣umph, and Complemented with the Visits of all Persons of Quality, and Congratulations of all her Friends, when every one Enquir'd of her,</HI> this Gentlemans Name and Coun∣try who was her Champion, <HI>She told them,</HI> at the place of death she expected
<PB N="133" REF="72"/> none, nor knew of any, that as he came from Heaven for ought She knew he was return'd thither again, for notwith∣standing the strictest Enquiry She could make, she heard no account of him. <HI>A Courser was immediately dispatch'd with Letters to give the Count a Relation of this great News, who was so extreamly Tran∣sported with it, that being but lately reco∣cover'd from a dangerous Feaver, it threw him into a Relapse of which within few dayes he dyed. But before his death, in his Cooler fits he order'd his Secretary to write a most kind and passionate Letter to the Countess to rejoyce with her for her Mi∣raculous preservation, which afterwards she receiv'd, he made his Will and left her all his whole Estate for Life, besides Jewels Plate and Money to a very great Value. Soon after his death she parted with all the Land to the next Heyr, for a Valuable con∣sideration in Money, and return'd to</HI> Eng∣land <HI>after She had been five years and three Months absent.</HI> Philanthus <HI>went as other

She told him she was heartily sorry for it, but that Fate and Chance ran through the whole World. Com∣pany coming in, Dinner was plac'd upon the Table, and when it was almost over,</HI> Philanthus <HI>put on the Ring and presented his Service to the Countess in a Glass of Wine, She presently saw the Ring and

<P>THe vast Number of Candles, that in the Winter Quarter are hung out every Night, and serve as an Ornament to the streets of <HI>London,</HI> began to light those who walk late without Torches, when one of the most Famous Surgeons of that populous City was sent for in great hast, and his Assistance desir'd at a House not far distant from his own, where he was immediately conducted, and there found a very Handsom Young Gentleman, (whom the Company called <HI>Leander</HI>) very desperately wounded, and up∣on search found, he had receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d two dan∣gerous pricks from a Sword; He heard those about him whispering that he had given himself those Wounds, so unexpectedly that none could divert the evil consequence of so bloody an Enterprise: The Surg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on would have applyed the first dressing to his Wounds,
<PB N="138" REF="75"/> but <HI>Leander</HI> would not permit him, saying, that he did not deserve longer to live on the Earth, and desired therefore that death might put a period to his Life; This gave occasion for some of the Company to En∣tertain an opinion that he was somewhat distemper'd in mind, whilst the rest did really believe him to be distracted, which he perceiving did earnestly desire their silence, and he would give them a Recital of his Misfortunes, accordingly he began his dis∣course in this manner.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">My Wife being some Months since g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne to divert her self at a Country-House be∣longing to some of her Kindred, I had the Misfortune to happen into the Com∣pany of a Young Person, whose beauty might claim precedence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o're her whole Sex.

<P><Q REND="margQuotes">Her Lodging being in a quarter of the City remote from mine, I thought I might easily bring her into an opinion
<PB N="139" REF="75"/> that I was a Batchellor, which I Endea∣vor'd to perswade her to, as knowing such most acceptable to them, the quality of Husband in such case being no ways pleasing to them, by reason they cannot hope (if occasion should so require) to obtain them for their own; I had wrought my self in a short time into her favour and good opinion, that all outward ap∣pearances perswaded me that nothing was wanting on my behalf, but a good cou∣rage and confidence to render me happy and contented, I resolved therefore vigo∣rously to put the Lady to it, but though I made a good attaque, she made no worse a defence, and told me, <HI>that unless it were in the way of Marriage, I must expect no favour from her.</HI> I was surprized at the resistance she made, whereby I learn't that outward appearances are often de∣ceitful, and that those Women which seem most complying by the manner of their carriage and conversation are quite other∣wise then what we take them for, when they are press'd to any thing beyond the bounds of an honest Affection.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">The resistance of that Lovely Maid who was called <HI>Clitia,</HI> did but the more inflame

<P><Q REND="margQuotes">This Counterfeit modesty and Virtue charm'd me with the more love, which seem'd to me as the greatest Marks of the entire Affection and Good-will she bore me; not in the least perceiving that she Entertain'd a Gallant Named <HI>Clitophon,</HI> who was of Intellig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce with her, to draw me into the snare of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trimony with her, so that I must be the Husband, and he the Gallant who would continue his Pastime at my Cost.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> beginning to grow weak, by reason of the great Loss of Blood he had sustained, was Interrupted in this part of his Story, that care might be taken of his Wounds, but he would not suffer their endeavours, not∣wirhstanding

<P><HI>My Perplexity having continued some time and not having yet Fixed upon any Resolution, I Received a Letter from my Wife, wherein she gave an Account what day she would Arrive at</HI> London. <HI>After the Reading of her Letter, I went to</HI> Clitia, <HI>and found her that day so Beau∣tiful and Charming (in my Imagination) that forthwith there was Framed in my Mind this horrible Design, which I am about to Relate, and which Caused me to Promise</HI> Clitia, <HI>that within a short time I would Espouse her, I then took my leave, my Mind being Fixed upon the damnable Resolution I had Pitch'd upon before; So soon as I Arrived at my own Lodging I Res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted this De∣vilish Enterprize, and took up Resolutions quite

<P><HI>Immediately my Crime returned into my re∣membrance and it presented it self with such Horrour to my imagination, that I could not endure to think of so vile a wretch as my self, then it was that I Framed a design to Kill my self, which just now I have put in Execution.

<P>In Finishing these words he was Seized with a great weakness, and dyed in a short time after. The Company (being his Friends) desired the Surgeon not to discover any thing of the matter; and the Confession he had made of his Crimes did greatly surprize and astonish the whole Company.</P>
