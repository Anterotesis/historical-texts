<HEAD>A LETTER from Monsieur <HI>S. L.</HI> a <HI>Polish</HI> Lord, to Monsieur the Mar∣quess <HI>C. L.</HI> In which are manifest∣ly discovered the Practices and se∣cret Intrigues of the <HI>French</HI> with the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Hungarian</HI> Rebels. With some Letters and Remarks upon this Subject.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have given me sufficient assu∣rances of the continuance of your Friendship in the Letter I now re∣ceived from you, and by the earnest desire you express of being informed by me of what our Sentiments are in <HI>Poland,</HI> concern∣ing the present Troubles in <HI>Hungary.</HI> The common report, you say, accuses the French of having raised the War with the <HI>Turk;</HI> and making use of <HI>Poland</HI> to set its Engines at Work, and put in execution its pernicious Designs. If you are of the same Opinion with our <HI>Polanders,</HI> I shall tell you, with my accustomed freedom, that you do not wholly wrong them; For it is true that my
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>Country-men, for some years past have suf∣fered themselves to be over-reacht by the <HI>French,</HI> and that by treating with them too ingenuously, they have insensibly been drawn in to bear a part with them in their evil Practices; and among others, in favour∣ing the Malecontents in <HI>Hungary.</HI> They acknowledge at present, though perhaps too late, their Errour, and begin to fear lest they have purchased to themselves Enemies, who after they have filled their own Country with Desolation, their Ambition and Bar∣barity may make them turn their Arms against <HI>Poland.</HI> Sir, we love our selves, and our Friendship cannot consist with those Peo∣ples Maximes. Their Politiques appear to us so much the more criminal, because there is no just revenge, but that which ob∣liges us to fight our Enemies with our Arms in our Hands, and openly; nor any so base, as that which makes us use wicked Devises, and execrable Treasons as the Instruments of their Ruine. I have a great esteem for the <HI>Sarmatians,</HI> because they had this good Quality, that they never suffered their sus∣pitions to prevail against any Mans credit, and that they chose always rather to judge of others according to their own Inclinations, than upon bare conjectures think them ca∣pable
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>of Malice. And I beg of you, Sir, to afford me the same Justice, at such time as at the Diet of <HI>Ratisbonne,</HI> you unravel <HI>Pene∣lopes</HI> weaving, and condemn my Countri∣mens wicked Politicks. I grant you, that the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> that by their caballing and Seditiousness have been banished their Coun∣try, have found in <HI>Poland</HI> both refuge and Friends to protect them. I easily also acknow∣ledge, that the original of all the Evils you complain of, has its rise from an abuse of the Liberty that we have in <HI>Germany.</HI> You may also reckon up so many Factions and Parties, whether in Peace or War, as there are lit∣tle Kings, that in these last Ages have raised themselves to the Royal Authority, and established their Throne in the midst of <HI>Ger∣many.</HI> Now after this, you ought not to be surprized to see that our Governours have granted the Favour of Hospitality to those that complained that their Liberty was ta∣ken from them in their Country, and that all Laws were violated to oppress them in the highest degree; since humanity it self, and the right of Neighbourhood could not let them refuse to admit them, till such time as they were reconciled to the Emperour the Sovereign and Master. It may yet be pre∣sumed that the <HI>French</HI> protected them,
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>thinking there was some merit in protect∣ing the Miserable oppressed. I am also of Opinion, that the <HI>Polanders</HI> were persuaded to suffer among themselves those that came from <HI>Hungary</HI> banished their Country, and deprived of their Goods, upon thoughts of preserving them to the Empire and Christi∣anity; and to the end that their Despair might not oblige them to have recourse to the <HI>Turk,</HI> to obtain his Protection. If it was the <HI>French</HI> Design in these last Wars of <HI>Germany</HI> to draw more business upon the Emperour, and divide his Forces; it ought to be remembred that we are not to mind in an Enemy either craft, or violence. How∣ever, I condemn that way of proceeding, which occasioned them to bear an Enemies Heart in time of Peace; and have a Horrour at their fomenting the troubles of <HI>Hungary</HI> with their Forces and Counsel. This Ma∣nagement breaks the most sacred bonds of Friendship and Peace. So have I always, and many others with me, thought it very ill that <HI>Frenchmen</HI> should go out of our Coun∣try, as it were out of the <HI>Trojan Horse,</HI> to go as Spies into <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Transylvania,</HI> for to raise Troubles, and encourage the dis∣contented so much the more by giving them Mony and Arms. All <HI>Europe</HI> knows how
<PB N="5" REF="4"/><HI>Bohancy,</HI> the Head of the Rebels of <HI>Transylva∣nia,</HI> with some <HI>French</HI> of the same Leven, famous for their Crimes committed in <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> run up and down to raise Seditions, and join themselves to the Rebels. How∣ever, the unviolable observance due to so solemn a Treaty of Peace, made me doubt, whether <HI>France</HI> did Authorise this Conduct; and I could no longer fix my Suspicions up∣on the most Christian King, when I reflect∣ed, it has alwayes been fatal to Sovereigns, by many Examples, to reduce Subjects to Revolt, or to maintain or protect them when they have rose against their Lawful Prince. Besides, I was never so bold or rash as to cry down the Glory of Kings and Sovereigns; and I can say, that if Fortune had been an∣swerable to my Government, having never offended any Body in my life, I should be very happy. The most Christian King, by the for∣tunate Success of his Arms, the greatness of his Exploits and Victories, has raised his Glory to so high a Pitch, that he ought on∣ly to use it with moderation, and it is need∣less for him to use unworthy artifices for to make himself more Glorious. Souls truly Royal and Magnanimous, have always de∣spised the Conquests they could more easily obtain by Cunning than by force of Arms.
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>And it was through this sentiment, worthy a great Heart, that <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great sharply rebuked his Favourite <HI>Parmenio,</HI> who would have put him upon a crafty De∣sign, saying to him, That it was fit only for Robbers to have recourse to Treachery, as their only means to compass their Thefts. Nevertheless, because the Ministers of Prin∣ces are People more zealous in their Em∣ployments than they should be, and hold that they may lawfully commit all sorts of Injustice for their Sovereign's interest, provi∣ded at the same time they do their business; I thought it might possibly be the same in <HI>France.</HI> The better to assure my self in this belief, I would be informed by those Gen∣tlemen, that keep the Bank here of the <HI>French</HI> mony (for we never want some <HI>Po∣landers,</HI> who had rather live under the <HI>French</HI> Slavery, than be satisfied with the liberty of <HI>Poland</HI>) what great concerns the <HI>French</HI> had with the Duke of <HI>Transylvania, Apafi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI> so much constrained to the <HI>Turks</HI> Party, what were the Designs and Intenti∣ons, and to what end was so much com∣ing and going of <HI>Akakia, Du Vernay Boucauld,</HI> and all the other Expresses.</P>
<P>At last, I found they gave no other Rea∣son, but that the <HI>French</HI> were at present in
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>Possession, and going through all Countrys, that they found every where Friends and Allies; and that they were at last arrived at the time of fulfilling the desire they had long had of seeing themselves Masters of all the World. This is it these <HI>French</HI> Prophets boast of, founding their hopes and pretensi∣ons upon this ground, that there is no other way of opposing the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> which aspires to the entire Monarchy of all <HI>Europe,</HI> but the <HI>French</HI> King's entring into a League with the <HI>Turk,</HI> and there making an Alli∣ance, and joyning their Forces by vertue of a Treaty, confirmed with an Oath taken upon the Holy <HI>Evangelists;</HI> but this you may learn better from the Original; as if it could ever be justifiable to revenge one in∣jury with another wrong done to all Chri∣stendome, and the Destruction of our Holy Mother the Church.</P>
<P>Having asked these French-men, what Prince of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> it was that disturbed <HI>France</HI> for this <HI>Ʋniversal Monarchy,</HI> they knew not which to name; this makes me believe, that those who judge of the pre∣sent by what is past, will without doubt say that the French and Turks have long ago agreed; and that the French Ambassador at <HI>Constantinople</HI> has no greater business with the
<PB N="8" REF="6"/><HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, than to instruct him about the Emperors Negotiations in <HI>Hungary,</HI> as a Famous <HI>Venetian</HI> said before me, and that the secret intention of the French, is to draw the War into those Provinces of the King∣dom of <HI>Hungary,</HI> that remain as yet undivi∣ded; to extend, when they shall think fit, their Dominions on the other side, through the Ruin of Nations, and Destruction of Christians.</P>
<P>However, the French Party every where exclaim, and ask, what advantage can the loss of <HI>Hungary</HI> produce to <HI>LEWIS THE GREAT?</HI> They say on the contrary, the King endeavours to preserve it in its obedi∣ence to the Emperour, and that his Majesty has given sufficient Testimony of it to the chiefest Princes in <HI>Europe;</HI> when <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> being attacked on all sides, and ready to Sur∣render, he left the Conquest of that impor∣tant Town, to which he has a just Claim, as soon as he knew that they were inform∣ed at <HI>Vienna,</HI> by an extraordinary Courtier, that the Turk was bringing all his Forces against the Empire, and had ordered his Army to March towards <HI>Belgrade,</HI> with a Design to Invade in this War all <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the Neighbouring Provinces to <HI>Austria.</HI> That the most Christian King had given a
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>signal demonstration of his Piety, in not hindring, as very advantagiously he could, the Emperour, and the rest whom the same misfortune threatned, from turn∣ing all their force upon the Enemy, and in withdrawing his Troops that were in <HI>Flan∣ders</HI> and upon the <HI>Rhine.</HI> We all admired, and highly extolled a Conduct so Glorious, so Pious, and so worthy a great Monarch, that would at so high a Rate purchase the peace and quiet of Christendom; and with∣out doubt the French that had come after∣wards, had received sincere Praises, if the thing had really been, or but always appear∣ed the same they represented it to us, but, praised be God, the Truth did not always lye hid under the specious pretences with which it was covered.</P>
<P>I pass by all examples of past ages, and only say, that after their actions in these latter times, there is no more doubt to be made of their sinister dealings. And to be fully satisfied in this point, it is only ne∣cessary to hear those that are best instruct∣ed in the causes of this rumour which I spread abroad. They say, that all their exactness in discovering of News has not been able to inform them that any acci∣dent had happened which should give occa∣sion
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>to the <HI>Turk</HI> to make a War either in <HI>Asia,</HI> or <HI>Greece, Thessaly,</HI> or any of his re∣mote Provinces; that nevertheless at the same time they have seen in several Letters of the <HI>French</HI> Emissaries, which were disper∣sed in <HI>Constantinople, Transylvania</HI> and <HI>Hun∣gary;</HI> how that last year, on the 30th of <HI>De∣cember,</HI> the War was resolved upon and sworn to against the Emperour, in the Pa∣lace of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and in the Holy Council, which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Divan,</HI> in which the Muphti, High Priest of the <HI>Ma∣hometan</HI> Religion presided. Which suffi∣ciently lays open the Authors and Procurers of this War; and clearly shews us that the <HI>French</HI> were not ashamed, as if it had been a famous action in them, to take advice in the <HI>Divan,</HI> and applaud the success of the Negotiations, as they did in their Letters writ backwards and forwards to the Rebels, in which they congratulated with them for having drawn the <HI>Turk</HI> to succour them. They promise each other in their Letters all the advantages they can expect, which aim at no less than to have the Emperour driven out of his best Estates, and the <HI>Turk</HI> advance into <HI>Christendom,</HI> bestowing Crowns on the one side, and rewards on the other, ac∣cording as every one shall have laboured with him for the freeing of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
<P>I lay not the stress of this upon any false rumour that has run among the People; I have assured and convincing testimonies of it; and the Persons from whom I take it, deserve we should make it a point of Con∣science faithfully to believe them.</P>
<P>Sir, if you suspended as yet your judge∣ment upon the <HI>French,</HI> on account of what I have told you; and if you should as yet persist in your belief, that the <HI>Polanders</HI> have had a hand in all this with the <HI>French;</HI> I would desire you to examine with that justice, which in you is usual, whether what I have related unto you is not sufficient to raise all your suspicions.</P>
<P>There is no body but knows that in last years assembly, our illustrious <HI>Hungarians</HI> loudly proclaimed, that such of their Coun∣try-men, as have been forced to retire to other Places, lived only upon such supplies of Mony, as they received from the <HI>French;</HI> that they would not make their Peace with the Emperor, whose Clemency extended but just so far as to offer it, and that they were resolved to prosecute their enterprize, upon assurance of the Promises that were made them. So afterwards <HI>Akakia</HI> renewed and confirmed more powerfully than ever the League and Alliance with the Malecon∣tents
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>of <HI>Transilvania.</HI> We also saw the <HI>French</HI> Emissaries without any shame of violating the Law of Nations, and in Countries of the solemn Treaty of Peace; though they had been manifestly discovered in a secret Con∣spiracy, run on afterwards more then ever, with an unparallelled Impudence, as if all things had been lawful to them.</P>
<P>You that know me, may well imagine what a trouble it was to me, to see that <HI>Po∣land,</HI> my Country, should be the Theatre where all these Villanies were acted, and not one <HI>Polander</HI> to be found who might unde∣ceive the World.</P>
<P>Yet the Emperor, with his ordinary Mer∣cy, suffered the Malecontents of <HI>Hungary</HI> to pass the next Water with as much quiet and security as they would desire, to the end to draw them by this affectionate con∣duct to lay down Arms, return to their Du∣ty, and live peaceably in their Country un∣der obedience; and I thought they would then for ever have left their Rebellion, if the Artifices of the French had permitted them to take good counsel.</P>
<P>We have been inform'd, how 100000 Florins were ordered at <HI>Paris</HI> to foment the Discontent of the Rebels in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and quicken the <HI>Turks</HI> the more; How this Sum
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>was delivered at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> the Metropolis of Royal <HI>Prussia,</HI> and put into the Hands of a Banker, whose Name is <HI>Fromontius,</HI> who afterwards delivered it to the French Emissa∣ries, at several payments, the better to hide the business. Moreover, we knew, how the <HI>Sieur du Vernay Boucauld,</HI> Count <HI>Teckely</HI>'s real Spy, caused to be delivered into the hands of the Sieur <HI>Valentin Nemessan,</HI> 11300 Ducats, to oblige the Malecontents to take Arms again, and attack the Cittadel of <HI>Zat∣mar,</HI> after the French fashion, with gilt Ar∣rows, I mean, to endeavour to gain the Ga∣rison, or Citizens, with money.</P>
<P>You knew, Sir, that in <HI>Poland,</HI> we highly disapproved of this Conduct, which was not totally unknown. The Principal Officers of our Court, before the whole Court, repre∣sented to the most Christian King's Ambas∣sadour, that we would no longer allow of such things. We told them, that by order of the whole Senate, we forbid the French to act, as we understood they lately had done, upon pain of our King's displeasure. <HI>Monsieur de Vitry</HI> endeavoured to excuse him∣self, he produced his Book, assuring us, that we should not find in all his Accounts that the Malecontents in <HI>Hungary</HI> had touched the money we spoke of, and which was all
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>delivered by his Order. Thus it is that De∣ceit and Craft hide the Truth under false pretences.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding you must know, that the French Money went into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and men have been employed on purpose to stop it; and even the very Women have not been ignorant of the Wiles and Practises of the French.</P>
<P>The Princess <HI>Radrivilliana,</HI> Widow to the Prince of that name, expresly forbid the suf∣fering any French to pass through her Coun∣try of <HI>Sacolia,</HI> bordering upon <HI>Transylvania,</HI> fearing lest they should, as in other places, corrupt the People with mony. Nevertheless the French, whether it was that they would venture all, or whether they thought they were sufficiently disguised not to be known, took their Journey through this Princess's hereditary Country, and one that was taken was carried to her Castle, whom she impri∣soned, loaded with Irons, and afterwards caused to be severely punished. The Mar∣quess <HI>De Vitri,</HI> as well as all the Court, saw this man run backwards and forwards, be∣ing obliged to take another way. This ge∣nerous Princess's Example may convince the World that there were those in <HI>Poland,</HI> who condemned the abominable practises of the French.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>
<P>All the world would have thought, that after this the <HI>Sieur du Vernay</HI> and all his un∣der Spies would have grown circumspect by the punishment of their Companion, or that at least they would have learnt to conceal themselves better. But on the contrary, they made it appear by their new behavi∣our, that when once a man has gone be∣yond the bounds of Honour he is fit for any thing. These Gentlemen, the Masters of Perfidiousness, perceived, that they had no fairer a convenience for to entertain a commerce with the French Ambassadour at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the Turks, and Malecontents in <HI>Hungary,</HI> than that which they found on the borders of <HI>Poland.</HI> They always had cor∣respondence, and had as often as they could private enterviews with the Sieurs <HI>Valentin Nemessan, Peter Iagel,</HI> and other particular Friends and Allies of <HI>Teckely.</HI> They more∣over endeavoured to have still more and more frequent Conferences in <HI>Transilvania,</HI> sending first one and then another to <HI>Paris,</HI> with the necessary Instructions of all their Proceedings.</P>
<P>So the Emperour's Ambassadour at this Court, who had notice of all, desired our most Serene King of <HI>Poland,</HI> that his Majesty would be pleased to give order, that no
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>French-man, not being an Ambassadour, or bearing some other Employment, should be allowed to stay in his Dominions. He added to his Entreaty the humble Remonstrance, that the ancient Treaties so often renewed between the Empire and <HI>Poland,</HI> required it for the publick Peace, neither did he omit what he had understood concerning the Be∣haviour of the French in <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Con∣stantinople.</HI> This occasioned that the most Christian King's Embassador was advertized by his Majesty of <HI>Poland,</HI> to order <HI>Akakia</HI> and <HI>Du Vernay</HI> to withdraw. At the same time he received a severe Animadversion about those Peoples Behaviour. The Senate told him, that we were no longer upon terms of conniving, since we had been informed, that the French more and more stirted up the Troubles of <HI>Hungary,</HI> to draw on a War with the <HI>Turk;</HI> that we knew from good hands what Mony they had given for it, what Ca∣bals they had had, and the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> kept every day. We declared that Man was a Spy, and a turbulent Person, who had no other business to detain him about <HI>Leopol,</HI> but only to treat with the <HI>Turks</HI> and Male∣contents, about the means and entring into a League together, for to draw the War in∣to <HI>Hungary;</HI> that therefore we earnestly de∣sired
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>he would cause him to retire. The Ambassador answered, that he would not do what we demanded; he loudly declared, that Monsieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> was sent with him into <HI>Poland,</HI> to manage the Affairs of the most Christian King their Master. He presumed very confidently to deny, that neither the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> nor he, had any commerce with the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> or <HI>Turks;</HI> on the con∣trary, he said, that the French King, in lea∣ving <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> had sufficiently testified how earnestly he desired the Peace of Christen∣dom, much less to give an occasion of sus∣pecting the French of any sinister Design. He promised however, to take away, as he said, all Suspitions, that the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> should go to <HI>Varovia,</HI> and that there he should execute his most Christian Majesties com∣mands. However, the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> upon the news of all these Accusations, had re∣tired to a Convent of Schismatick Monks of the order of St. <HI>Basil.</HI> And this did not put an end to these Practices, so unworthy the name of Christianity.</P>
<P>Some time after, the Emperours Ambassa∣dour discovered that new sums of Mony were come to <HI>Dantzick</HI> for the French. This and many other things which he understood at the same time, obliged him to renew his Pray∣ers
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>to his Majesty of <HI>Poland.</HI> He had Audi∣ence in the Presence of the Marquess <HI>De Vi∣try,</HI> the French Embassador, and before the whole Senate. He spoke a long time, and all his Speech consisted of Complaints against the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay.</HI> He said, he had only changed the Place, and not his way of Pro∣ceeding, and still daily continued his Crafts in <HI>Poland.</HI> He produced a Paper he had recei∣ved by the last Post; by which he was given to understand, that the remainder of the Mony the French had engaged for to the Rebels, by the agreement made between them of one hundred thousand Florins, was lately delivered at <HI>Dantzick.</HI> He ended, be∣seeching his Majesty of <HI>Poland,</HI> to be plea∣sed now at last to purge his Dominions of those dangerous and seditious Men, who by all means fomented the Troubles of <HI>Hungary.</HI> He said, the Miseries of <HI>Hungary</HI> would reach <HI>Poland,</HI> since the Toleration they had, ten∣ded to the Violation of the Treaty of Peace, till now always inviolably observed. He pro∣tested, if we gave not satisfaction to his de∣mands, he should be obliged to publish in all Princes Courts, and would make known to all <HI>Europe,</HI> that the French, by their abo∣minable Methods and Practises, are the Au∣thors of the Troubles of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Tran∣silvania,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>and cause of the <HI>Turkish</HI> War. That they have sacrificed to their hatred, and en∣vy against the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> the best purchased Provinces of the Empire, in which they have exercised their Treacheries and Treasons. That they have done all this to make good their ground in the Provinces they have torn from the Empire, and which they cannot retain by any other lawful right. In a word, that their aim in all these Proceed∣ings is only to renew the Treaty of Peace, up∣on pretence that we have broke it, to the end they may the better retain their Usur∣pations, and have an occasion of seizing what is left of the Empire.</P>
<P>This Speech was convincing, and we could do no less than to press anew the <HI>French</HI> Embassadour to oblige the Sieur <HI>de Vernay</HI> to depart <HI>Poland:</HI> We told him from the King and Senate, that we would no longer be satisfied with the vain pre∣tences he alledged to detain him. Then Monsieur the Marquis <HI>de Vitry</HI> declared, (which he durst not do the last time) that Monsieur <HI>Du Ʋernay Boucauld,</HI> was joint Embassadour with him from the <HI>French</HI> King. He came thus far to save him by the quality of Embassadour, sheltering him under the Law of Nations.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>
<P>This Declaration stopt our <HI>Polander</HI>'s mouths; they thought no more of demand∣ing the departure of him that was the real Author of the Rebellion of <HI>Hungary;</HI> and they spoke not the least word to put a stop to his licentiousness by a just advice: On the contrary, they promised the Embassa∣dour, that the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> his pre∣tended Companion, should have all liberty to act for his Master.</P>
<P>This soft and complying behaviour of the <HI>Polanders</HI> cannot be better excused, than by saying, that without doubt they remembred upon this occasion, that the <HI>French</HI> of late years, make no greater com∣plaint, than when their Embassadours or Agents, that have liberty in all Countries, are touched, though never so slightly.</P>
<P>(These are the words of <HI>Charles Pascal,</HI> a <HI>French-man,</HI> in his Treatise he made of Embassies.) "And they do like the Wolfs, who draw the Sheep far from the Shepherd, that they may afterwards devour them. In fine, it is upon these frivolous accusations, that the <HI>French,</HI> to have some pretence for making War, have at other times so loud∣ly complained, and not long since, against <HI>Germany,</HI> saying, They observed not the law of Nations, and broke the most sacred
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>bonds of Humanity, and the Peace to∣wards their Embassadors. Yet at the same time, they passed by and endured, with∣out one word speaking, the horrid injuries and most barbarous usage their Embassa∣dours received at the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port.</P>
<P>I must needs tell you here, Sir, that if you wonder that we suffer the <HI>French</HI> Emis∣saries in <HI>Poland,</HI> under the pretended qua∣lity of an Embassadour; we have much more reason to admire in <HI>Poland</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> are received in the principal Courts in <HI>Germany</HI> with great kindness and satisfa∣ction, notwithstanding there is so much reason to mistrust their intentions.</P>
<P>This makes me think, dear Sir, that even at this day we might see the observance of the Laws, the love of your Country, the love and respect due to the Emperour, in which you were so exact the last age, sub∣sist amongst you, if the French had not been the first in changing this good order, by conjuring with the <HI>Turks.</HI> Then, 'tis true, a Law made in a Diet was publish∣ed in <HI>Germany;</HI> by which all sort of com∣merce with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> their Confederates, was forbidden through the whole Empire; to hinder the sprouting of the seeds of Division and Rebellion,
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>which that perfidious Nation casss where∣ever it is admitted. Since no <HI>French</HI> Em∣bassadour was admitted in any one Court in <HI>Germany,</HI> so little did they trust the <HI>French;</HI> and scarce would the Princes of the Empire receive Letters from that Coun∣try. Now things are much changed, and we may well cry, when we see the present miseries of <HI>Germany, O tempora! O mores!</HI></P>
<P>Yet all the World has not the same opi∣nion of the French. But to convince you, I will give you an example so much the more to be imitated, because it would be extremely advantagious to <HI>Germany,</HI> if the same were done there. It happened in <HI>Po∣land,</HI> The Castellan of <HI>Primislau,</HI> percei∣ving that neither his Majesty of <HI>Poland,</HI> nor the Senate expelled the French Spies, and moreover that their designs always suc∣ceeded better and better, and that they were going to destroy, by the <HI>Turkish</HI> War they were drawing on, a million of innocent Christians, refused to permit the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> to enter his Village of <HI>Nimirovia,</HI> and assembled a number of men to oblige him to pass another way; so much did he fear this man, of whom he had heard so many things.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>
<P>There wanted not for great complaints. The Marquis <HI>de Vitry</HI> was highly incensed, and sought all ways of revenge. And as he is the Most Christian King's Embassa∣dour, went directly to Court, to lay before his Majesty of <HI>Poland,</HI> after his own fashion, the affront and indignity offered, contrary to the Law of Nations, to his Companion, the Sieur <HI>du Vernay;</HI> and was so bold as to demand that the Castellan should be impri∣soned for satisfaction. The King could not endure this confidence, and told him very harshly, That it was to no purpose to couch the Sieur <HI>du Vernay</HI> under the quality of Ambassadour, that the Tragedies he acted under the vain pretence of an Embassy were well known; that all the devices of the French, and their contracts with the Turk were discovered; that the places where <HI>Akakia</HI> and <HI>du Vernay</HI> had Conferences were named; their resolutions and designs known; that we could exactly tell how much Mo∣ney was sent from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Hungary;</HI> and how they had used violence, deceit, and wicked practices against the Emperour, to the misfortune of Christendom.</P>
<P>The Ambassadour would have cleared himself of those things, with which, he said, we wrongfully charged his Nation. He
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>thought there was no body could convict the French of their actions in this Country. But the King, who grew hot, would not hear him. He only told him, he would lay 10000 Pistols with him, that we would prove un∣deniably all that he had said:</P>
<P>I tell you nothing here, Sir, but what I have seen and heard, and if you had been present, you would have thought with me, you had heard <HI>Cicero</HI> speak in the Roman Senate, instead of the King of <HI>Poland, How long,</HI> Catiline, <HI>will you abuse our patience? How long shall your fury sport at us? to what end will your impudence come? are you igno∣rant that all your Designs are known to us? don't you perceive that all my Citizens are con∣vinced of the Conspiracy you carry on with the Malecontents of</HI> Hungary <HI>and the</HI> Turks?</P>
<P>The Marquess <HI>de Vitry</HI> pressed no farther for the liberty of the French Agents. He did not, like <HI>Catiline,</HI> pray we should not enter∣tain those thoughts of him and his, which no Body believ'd; that when <HI>Hungary</HI> were lost, we should have need of the French. He look∣ed like one astonished at this blow. He stood amazed, and his silence sufficiently confirm∣ed the thing. All the other French that were present, in a consternation, fixed their Eyes upon the ground, and lifted them not up but
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>to look upon each other, as it were accusing themselves. So certain it is, that the inward sting of Conscience, and the secret power of Truth, dashes the most fierce and confident, and by reducing the guilty to a shameful si∣lence, forces them to make some sort of con∣fession of their Crimes.</P>
<P>Sir, Here you have a very acceptable Hi∣story to tell such of your Countrymen as can well praise all the French actions, whether good or bad. Next, you may ask them, whether they expect a good Peace with the French, because they so highly extoll the advantages and pleasures of Peace.</P>
<P>If the Ghost of the Emperour <HI>Tiberius</HI> should come from Hell, and appear in you assembly of the States of the Empire, how justly would he blame you, and say, <HI>O men, born to slavery! will your softness extend so far as not to believe, but that we only imagine what is done openly in sight of the whole world, which we see, and even feel.</HI> This I say, because I know there are some amongst you, that suf∣ficiently mistrust the French, to know what they are to think of them, whether they suspect them for not observing the Peace, or for entring into a League with the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>But I also believe, which is much better, that there are many <HI>Germans,</HI> who will talk
<PB N="26" REF="15"/>boldly of taking away the snares that are laid for them, and endeavouring to defend the liberty of their Country. I still remember what I saw in <HI>Germany</HI> when I travelled in it. At least I doubt not, but that if you would Unite your selves to re-establish the glory of <HI>Germany,</HI> and retain the valour of your Ancestors, you might live at home like Kings, and laugh at those who have made themselves slaves to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But what side must be taken in so great a diversity of Opinions, and among so many occasions of fear on both sides. My opinion is little to the purpose, but if you will believe me, you would judge, that you have most reason to fear what threatens you from the East, than from any other place. For what can you expect from a War with the <HI>Turk</HI> but the total ruin of your Goods, and utter destruction of your Countrey. There is an end of your Liberty, your Religion, your Life, and all you can lose in this World.</P>
<P>So that since you have still time to con∣sider what you are to do, imagine some∣times your Churches, your Houses, your Wives, your Children and your Country, comming to you and conjuring by all they have deserved from you, that you will not leave them as a prey to your common Ene∣mies,
<PB N="27" REF="15"/>and to prevent the Miseries of a cruel slavery that threatens their Liberty.</P>
<P>If you will say that <HI>Hercules</HI> himself wont encounter two; that therefore you must treat with the French at any rate. You may still think, if you please, that the Kingdom of <HI>Hungary</HI> is of far greater value and conse∣quence, as being the bulwark of Christen∣dom, than the City of <HI>Strasburg.</HI> That at present you must behave your self like a prudent Pilot in a Storm, who choses rather to cast his Merchandise into the Sea, than venture losing all, by endeavouring to preserve all. But I must also tell you, that you have reason to fear, lest under those beautiful Leaves, a Snake lyes hid. You must believe the French have stirred up the <HI>Turks.</HI> And these shall no sooner have entred <HI>Au∣stria,</HI> besieged <HI>Vienna,</HI> as without doubt they will besiege it, destroyed all the Country round it; and finally reduced <HI>Germany</HI> to the last Extremities; but the French, invited by your Prayers, will voluntarily come of∣fer you their Service. But instead of Wa∣ter to quench the Fire, they will bring Oyl to make it the fiercer.</P>
<P>Sir, I shall not say many other things that I think about this matter. I only add, that methinks I see a History, almost the same
<PB N="28" REF="16"/>with that we read of a Roman Emperor, who had a Fancy to set on fire the four cor∣ners of <HI>Rome</HI> for the Pleasure, as he said, of seeing a Fire equal to that of <HI>Troy;</HI> and thereby to have an occasion of doing good to the miserable Citizens, who would come to complain of their Miseries and Misfor∣tunes. Perhaps <HI>Nero,</HI> in this cruel Scene, de∣sired nothing but the Glory of building a new City, and calling it by his own Name.</P>
<P>If you believe me, endeavour above all things to take away the Snares that are laid for you. The French King, as all other Christian Princes, is obliged to defend you against the <HI>Turks;</HI> and you will have so lit∣tle trouble in obtaining of it, that he has al∣ready agreed upon it with your Enemy. But what will be the event? You will infal∣libly come to complain of one another, be∣cause some will be contented, and others dis∣satisfied; Whilst you are taken up in these Disputes, the French will do their Work, and at last you will find your selves under their Dominion, cast down, conquered and made Slaves without daring to say so.</P>
<P>Do not then stay to dispute Rights and Interests, till the time when the noise of Arms and the fury of War will hinder you from hearing the Law. Be the <HI>Horatii,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="16"/>and not the <HI>Curatii</HI> of your Country. In fine, remember that the members separated from the Head languish away like Carcasses. Be faithful to your Soveraign, the Empe∣rour, your lawful Prince: He has ascended the Throne by a right owned by all the World; he has always upheld himself with Glory; you are used to obey him, and he always applied himself to your preservation. You ought to pay him all sorts of respect, if you expect in him a Protector and Father, and if you fear drawing the wrath of Hea∣ven on your heads. What light would the Planets have if they darkned the Sun? If you prefer the Moon hid under the <HI>Flower∣de-Luces</HI> before the Sun at which your <HI>Eagle</HI> looks; if you had rather be slaves to the <HI>French</HI> King, than obey the Emperour, all things will happen worse and worse to you; and you will draw all the Cruelty of the Barbarians on you, as a punishment of your Perjury and breach of Faith.</P>
<P>You are not ignorant of the reproach that we cast upon you, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> are the only people that desire to be subject to a Foreign Government, and have no love for their Country. That reproach cannot justly be retorted upon us; and <HI>Ger∣many</HI> shall ever find in the <HI>Polanders</HI> all sort
<PB N="30" REF="17"/>of friendship and service. We foresee the dangers that threaten us, and seeing of it, our Fore-fathers example, our promised Faith, and our natural inclination, stir us up powerfully to the defence of our Coun∣trey.</P>
<P>Sir, I know, that to make you sensible of all that my Friendship and sincerity has made me say, I need only represent it to you. It only remains that I desire you to tell me your Opinion with the same free∣dom, that I may be delivered from the dis∣quietness the sight of the present Evils, and the fear of those that threaten us, has put me into. It is time you should read the pieces I send you. Farewel.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Speech of</HI> Monsieur Zerowiski, <HI>the Emperour's Embassadour in</HI> Poland. <HI>Spoken in the Royal Palace before his Majesty of</HI> Poland, <HI>and in the Pre∣sence of the Princes, Noblemen, and Embassadors at that Court; at</HI> Ta∣voravia, <HI>the</HI> 6th <HI>of</HI> October, 1682.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most Great King,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMongst other Books, I have hit upon that of the Life and Exploits of Cardinal <HI>Commendon</HI> who was sent to this Court by the <HI>Pope,</HI> with the Quality of extraordinary <HI>Legate,</HI> in the Em∣pire of <HI>Sigismond,</HI> and Reign of <HI>Henry de Va∣lois:</HI> I have observed in it, that it was that Cardinal's Maxim, Never to answer but with an affected Silence and Contempt, to all that his Enemies could do or say against him. Without doubt, in his time, the state of Affairs, the Customs and Spirits were very different from what they now are; at least, a long experience has made me judge them very different; and I know I cannot, without great disadvantage, conceal or connive at a thing that very much troubles me. I have understood that the French King's Ministers, published some dayes ago, certain Letters, which brought, as it were, assured Testi∣monies, that His Imperial Majesties Envoy's only Busi∣ness with the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court was to endeavour, by all possible means, to turn the <HI>Turkish</HI> Armies against <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>There is no Body but sees, and your Majesty must needs perceive, how injurious this is to the Empire; and to what end it is done. They give this out to dis∣unite Two Kingdoms; both which, at this present Con∣juncture of Affairs, have their chief Interest in being firm∣ly
<PB N="32" REF="18"/>united. But the Letters took not so great an effect as they expected. The Spirits of this Court, were not so credulous as to believe them. They are too well satis∣fied in <HI>Poland,</HI> of the Piety and Affection of those of the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> to think that the Emperor, my Ma∣ster, gives his Embassadors such base and unworthy Com∣missions. There is no Body here that can doubt that his Imperial Majesty, would be as sensible of the loss of <HI>Poland</HI> as of <HI>Hungary,</HI> since it is as much his Interest to preserve the one as the other.</P>
<P>I come not hither, great King, to tell you what through my Aversion, I could publish upon little Rumours that have been spread among us; I bring your Majesty those things, which I can beyond all dispute, produce before the whole World, as the true Originals of Letters and Answers, which the most Christian King's Embassador, Monsieur <HI>Du Vernay Boucauld,</HI> who is here present, has writ to Count <HI>Tekely,</HI> the Head of the <HI>Malecontents,</HI> or received from him. These will evidently discover to your Majesty, what Affairs Mounsieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> has Treated about, with so much secresie and circumspecti∣on with Count <HI>Tekely;</HI> and the reason he had so cauti∣ously to conceal from you the Commission he had in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>I humbly intreat your Majesty to remember how ear∣nestly I intreated you, to remove the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> from your Court and Dominions, as a man pernicious to the Empire, and <HI>Poland.</HI> You would have, Great King, invincible Proofs and Testimonies of what I rela∣ted; Here they are, such as you will wish for, and I am persuaded they will be sufficient to make you judge the speedy departure of Monsieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> out of your Kingdom, very necessary. But I fear, troubling your Ma∣jesty with a long Discourse; I pass by a thousand things which I could add; this Memorial is enough, To you I present it with all imaginable respect.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>Memorial</HI> presented to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> by Monsieur <HI>Zero∣wisky,</HI> the Emperour's Resident.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which was read in the presence of his Majesty of <HI>Poland,</HI> and before the Princes and Mi∣nisters of his Court; at <HI>Tavoravia,</HI> the 6th of <HI>October, 1682.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SInce the last <HI>Memerial</HI> which I had the Honour to present to your Majesty, I have endeavoured, ac∣cording to the Advice of the Illustrious Lords of the Senate, to furnish my self with some piece that might evidently shew what Correspondence the <HI>French</HI> King's Agents have in your Kingdom with Count <HI>Tekely,</HI> Head of the Malecontents in <HI>Hungary.</HI> These wanted also to inform you, what Bargains and Agreements passed be∣tween them, which, as I said, tend to the breaking off the Peace and Treaties, that are between your Majesty and the Emperor, my Master. You could not easily be informed of it from any but my self. I know the <HI>French</HI> King's Ministers daily assur'd your Majesty, that they had a Hand in no such thing; and that we accu∣sed them falsely. And the French would no longer be suspected to have any ill Design against the Empire, after the Declaration the French King had made, at the rai∣sing the Bloccade of <HI>Luxemburg.</HI> His most Christian Majesty would inform all <HI>Europe,</HI> how he behaved him∣self in that occasion; and they were careful to carry his Declaration to all the Courts of the chief Christian Princes. The French King plausibly declares, that having been informed of the Designs which are carrying
<PB N="34" REF="19"/>on in the <HI>Fast</HI> against the Empire, he would put nothing in Execution which might hinder his Imperial Majesty, and the most August House of <HI>Austria,</HI> from opposing the <HI>Turks</HI> with all their Forces, and providing for the com∣mon good of Christendom.</P>
<P>This could by no means allow your Majesty to believe, that the <HI>French</HI> were in League with the Maltcontents and <HI>Turks;</HI> and that they contributed to the taking and plundering the Towns of <HI>Hungary;</HI> for that appeared to be quite contrary to such fair Declarations: But God, the Defender and Revenger of Christians, has ordered those things to fall into my hands, which I lay at the foot of your Majesties Throne; and which I lay before the Eyes of the whole World. These are the Sieur <HI>Da Vernay</HI>'s Letters, and Correspondence with Count <HI>Tekeley;</HI> which you will find diametrically opposite to those Declarations, so worthy the Piety and Genero∣sity of the most Christian King.</P>
<P>I have made use of no evil practice for the obtaining these Letters: I have not, though I could have done it, so much as employed any Body to observe the <HI>French.</HI> And to tell you all, I got these Letters by the means of the Steward of the most Illustrious Lord <HI>Stadnick</HI>'s Estate. The Sieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> after having long im∣portuned the Monks of a Monastery of St. <HI>Basil,</HI> went also to importune the Steward, who is <HI>Castellan</HI> at <HI>Pre∣mislaw.</HI> So much he did, that he stirred up the Gen∣tlemans Anger against himself, and so consequently he became my Friend, and has ever since been very favour∣able to my Intentions. This <HI>Castellan,</HI> some dayes ago, stopt certain <HI>Hungarians</HI> coming back from <HI>Nimiravia,</HI> whither they went to see the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay;</HI> immedi∣ately he ordered them to be brought to me, with the Letters he sound about them. I presently took care to convey them to the Emperour, my Master's Territories; sending at the same time the Letters, to the end that all the World might judge, whether I had not just cause to
<PB N="35" REF="19"/>suspect, that the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> exceeded his Master's orders.</P>
<P>Certainly, this Agent, this Minister, this Spy, this Ambassador, I know not what to call him, but I mean Monsienr <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> has committed a great outrage against all Christendom. Against the Emperor, in fo∣menting and contriving what he has against him. Against your Majesty, in entertaining a Commerce so unworthy, so pernicious, and for so long a time, without your know∣ledge, and in your Kingdom, as if he had been at home. I must add, for the Interest of your Kingdom, that this Conduct has given the World occasion to believe, that the <HI>Polanders</HI> were blind enough, not to see the dangers their Neighbours made them fear, and that they would themselves drive the Poniard to their own Breast, in permitting the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> to live amongst them. His proceeding will, without doubt, appear very in∣jurious to the French King; for that Posterity may judge and believe, that the great King, <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV, Authorized or commanded, what the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> his Agent did in his Name.</P>
<P>Your Majesty will not take it ill, that we have disco∣vered to the Assemblies at <HI>Francfort</HI> and <HI>Ratisbonne,</HI> the Famous Exploits of the French, with the Turks and Rebels of <HI>Hungary,</HI> in your Kingdom, which for so ma∣ny Ages has been closely united with the August-House of <HI>Austria;</HI> and has alwayes acknowledged its own Inte∣rest, to preserve <HI>Hungary</HI> to the Empire, thinking it im∣possible for <HI>Peland</HI> to subsist if <HI>Hungary</HI> shall sall.</P>
<P>It is now a year, that the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> travels up and down several Parts of your Maiestjes Dominions, on the Borders of <HI>Hungary.</HI> He always pretends his Masters, as if we could see that <HI>Dantzick</HI> or <HI>Rogioment,</HI> which are the Places the French come through, were not nearer and more proper to receive what Orders the French King would send. But he stays there to observe the nearer the Affairs of <HI>Hungary:</HI> It may be also, to
<PB N="36" REF="20"/>be in a better condition to go give Count <HI>Tekeley</HI> joy, and to get the reputation with him, of the Progress the Turks, by his means, might make in that Country.</P>
<P>I desire your Majesty, that after you have seen the Memorial I present; and after you are convinced of all the Arts the French have used in this Kingdom, you will be pleased to order the Sieur <HI>Da Vernay</HI> to depart your Dominions, since he abuses his Employments to the prejudice of all Christendom; and renders himself unworthy the Protection the Law of Nations allows.</P>
<P>You may do it so much the more justly, great King, because the Roman Catholick Church, your Mother, esteems them as Excommunicated Persons, who side with Infidels, whether it be carrying them Arms, or treating with them.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> has drawn this upon his own head, and if he is punished according to his deserts, the most Christian King will banish him his Kingdom, for ex∣ceeding his Orders, and engaging his Master's Honour and Reputation. In fine, he has committed his Villa∣nies in the French King's Name, and broke his Master's word; acting in all things contrary to the observance of it, which if it should fail in the World, could be no where found but in the Mouth of a King or Prince.</P>
<P>I doubt not, great King, but all my pressing, reite∣rated and just instances, will at last take effect. The Al∣liances and Treaties that are between this Kingdom and the Empire, require it from your Majesty. And I also, with a most profound respect, beg to be admitted to the honour of some part of your Affections,</P>

<P>I Received with great joy the Letters, you did me the honour to write to me, from the Camp before <HI>Fil∣leck,</HI> enclosed in the Pacquets of our Ambassadors at <HI>Constantinople;</HI> nevertheless, I was a little surprized, that you should seal them before he had seen them. I wonder also, you said nothing about the Siege of <HI>Filleck.</HI> However, I doubt not but that place, by this time, is in your power. Monsieur <HI>Jaygel,</HI> I believe, knows by my last Letters, that I have several times endeavoured to send him what I promised, and let him have what I have received, but I always wanted an opportunity. When you send any of your People to me, order them not to come to my House but at Night, to the end we may do our business without any bodies knowledge. But what I most earnesty desire is, that above all things, they take care not to follow the Road that goes directly from <HI>Tavoravia</HI> to <HI>Nimirovia.</HI> For here are several Po∣lish Gentlemen, who, by the most Serene King of <HI>Po∣land</HI>'s Order, search, visit, and detain all strangers that pass. The safest way, in my Opinion is, that they leave <HI>Premislaw</HI> and <HI>Toreslavia</HI> on the right hand, and follow the Road that leads to <HI>Sandomiria,</HI> lest they be seen to enter <HI>Nimirovia,</HI> where I am surrounded with Spyes.

<P>The Audience being ended, His Majesty of <HI>Poland</HI> said, he was convinced of the French Correspon∣dence with the Malecontents. He shew'd himself very angry that the thing had been conceal'd from him. Next day some of the chief Officers of his Court, had Order to go and command the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> imme∣diately to depart the Kingdom.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Doubt not, but you have made much of Monsieur <HI>Valentine Nemessani,</HI> my Envoy. He has alwayes been faithful to me, and very true to my Interest. The Recommendations you gave him touching the Affairs he
<PB N="39" REF="21"/>communicated with you; will, without doubt, be of great Importance to him, with the Most Christian King. I am beholding to you for all you have done for him, and shall acknowledge it, as occasion serves: It is time I should inform you, of the present state of my Affairs. After I had taken <HI>Cassovia,</HI> and entered some Forts about it, I went with the Vizier of <HI>Budas</HI> Troops, to attack the Famous Fort of <HI>Filleck:</HI> The Inhabitants re∣fused, at first, to put themselves under my Protection; but after a fortnights Siege, they came to beg I would admit them to Capitulate; I granted them what they asked; which was, that the Garrison, and what other Prople there was, should go out, carrying with them as much as they could upon their Backs: Then I raised the Fort, in sight of the Imperial Army, which was hard by in the Mountains. As I am now informed, it is marched away: and having sacked the Town of <HI>Vieuxsols,</HI> and other places, retires very hastily. I design to follow the Imperialists, and drive them far off, to restore my Country to its former Liberty. At length the Emperor will be forced to yield by Force, what we beg as a Favour. Heaven has commiserated my Fortune indeed somewhat late; but I also hope, it will draw on a greater and more speedy Vengeance. Sir, I will take care to inform you of all my other Affairs; however I desire you alwayes to stand my Friend. I am</P>

<P>LAst Wednesday we took and raised <HI>Filleck:</HI> where above a thousand <HI>Janizaries</HI> were slain. After∣wards, the Vizier made all the <HI>Hungarians</HI> that were present, and were under the Prince of <HI>Transilvania</HI>'s Dominion, be brought before our Illustrious <HI>Count;</HI> then all the Estates of the upper <HI>Hungary</HI> being assembled, Monsieur <HI>Tekeler</HI> was proclaimed King, and confirmed in that Quality by the Great Turk, who sent him from the Port, a Hat instead of a Crown, with a Standard, and Scepter. After the Ceremony, the <HI>Count</HI> very modestly refused the Title of King: He is satisfied with that of Prince Regent of <HI>Hungary:</HI> His Titles are, <HI>Eme∣ricus Thokolius Princeps, ac partium Regni Hungariae Do∣minus,</HI> &amp;c.
