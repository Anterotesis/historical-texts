<HEAD>THE

<P>HAving the Favour of some
<HI>Notes</HI> from my Honoured
Friend <HI>Sir Thomas Linch
Knight,</HI> about the <HI>Descrip∣tion</HI>
of the <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> whose
Worth and Ingenuity hath lately
merited from his <HI>Majesty the Go∣vernment</HI>
of the said <HI>Isle;</HI> as like∣wise
the opportunity of several <HI>Pa∣pers</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
relating to the <HI>Affairs</HI> and <HI>De∣scription</HI>
of the other <HI>Isles</HI> and <HI>Ter∣ritories</HI>
in <HI>America,</HI> wherein the
<HI>English</HI> are concerned, which I re∣ceived
from the hands of several
of my <HI>Friends</HI> who are related
thereunto, I thought them very
fit to be <HI>Published.</HI> The said
<HI>Notes</HI> and <HI>Papers</HI> I have digested
into a clearer and more compen∣dious
Method; being brief <HI>De∣scriptions</HI>
thereof, which this small
<HI>Treatise</HI> only aimeth at; and not
to trouble the <HI>Reader</HI> with large
and unnecessary discourses no ways
proper for the Design in hand:
for by that means, I might (by the
help of a large <HI>Print</HI> which some
Publisher of <HI>Books</HI> call Ornamen∣tal)
have put them to an unne∣cessary
charge in Buying, and as
great a trouble in Reading. I
have also added some <HI>Maps</HI> for
<PB REF="4"/>
the more utility thereof, which
were taken from the <HI>Latest Sur∣veys.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The forme and Extent of
the Isle.</HEAD>
<P>It is something inclined to an
Oval Forme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Form Ex∣tent.</NOTE> being from East to
West 170 Miles in length; and
from North to South in the midst
where it is broadest about 70, it
waxing narrower and narrower

<P>From East to West along the
the midst of the <HI>Isle</HI> runns a con∣tinued
Ridge of lofty <HI>Mount<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins</HI>
which are full of fresh <HI>Springs,</HI>
whence flow the many Rivers that
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
so plentifully waters the <HI>Island,</HI> to
the great refreshment and accom∣modation
of the <HI>Inhabitants.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Soyle, Fertility, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>It is in most parts (especially the
north) of a rich and fat <HI>Soyle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Soyl, and Fer∣tility.</NOTE> be∣ing
of a <HI>blackish Earth,</HI> in many
places mixt with a <HI>Clay,</HI> and in
some, as the south West <HI>Parts,</HI>
it is of a more red and loose <HI>Earth,</HI>
but every where incomparable
apt to produce, and liberally to
answer the <HI>Cultivators</HI> cost and
paines for what is planted; being
alwayes <HI>Springing,</HI> and its <HI>Trees</HI>
and <HI>Plants</HI> never disrobed of their
<HI>summer Livery,</HI> every month be∣ing
to them as our <HI>May,</HI> or <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>Here are many <HI>Savanas</HI> which
are intermixed with the <HI>Hills</HI>
and <HI>Woods,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Savanas,</HI> formerly Fields of <HI>Indian</HI> Maiz.</NOTE> (especially in the
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
North and South parts, where are
great store of wild <HI>Cattel)</HI> which
by report were sometimes <HI>Feilds</HI>
of <HI>Indian Maiz,</HI> or <HI>Wheat,</HI> which
when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> became
<HI>Masters</HI> of the <HI>Isle,</HI> they conver∣ted
to <HI>Pasture</HI> for the feeding of
their <HI>Cattel;</HI> bringing hither
from <HI>Spain, Horses, Cowes, Hoggs,</HI>
and <HI>Asenegros</HI> for a Breed, after
they had destroyed all the <HI>Na∣tives,</HI>
or <HI>Indians,</HI> which according
to calculation, did amount to a∣bout
60000. which <HI>Cattel</HI> did
exceedingly encrease, witness the
great heards of <HI>Horses,</HI> and other
<HI>Cattel,</HI> that are now wild in the
<HI>Woods;</HI> besides the great quan∣tities
of <HI>Cows</HI> that have been
Killed by the <HI>English,</HI> since they
became <HI>Masters</HI> thereof: And
these <HI>Savanas</HI> are the most bar∣ren,
as being so long made use
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
of without Tillage; yet doth they
produce such great Plenty of <HI>Grass,</HI>
that the <HI>English</HI> are constrained
oft-times to burn it up.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Air, and Temperature.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> is here more tempe∣rate
then in any of the <HI>Caribbee
Isles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air &amp; Tem∣perature</NOTE> as seated more Northerly,
and of as mild a temperature (as
to <HI>Heate)</HI> as any place between
the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> being always cooled
with fresh Breezes, that constant∣ly
bow easterly, and refreshed
with frequent <HI>Showers</HI> of <HI>Rain,</HI>
and such <HI>Dews</HI> that fall in the
night (much quickning the growth
of what is <HI>Planted)</HI> that it may
truly be called <HI>temperate</HI> and
healthful; and by reason of its
continuall <HI>Verdure</HI> (as I have be∣fore
noted) exceeding Delight∣ful.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
And it is observed that the west
and east <HI>Parts</HI> of the <HI>Isle</HI> are most
subject to <HI>Raine</HI> and <HI>Windes;</HI> and
the <HI>Woods</HI> being also thick, and
close, rendreth the <HI>Aire</HI> less agree∣able,
then the North and South
Parts, which are more plain and
open, and less subject to <HI>Raine</HI>
and <HI>Winds.</HI> The <HI>Mountaines</HI>
which run along the midle of the
<HI>Isle</HI> from one extreame point to
the other, are much Cooler then
the other parts, insomuch that oft
times in the mornings there is small
white <HI>Frosts.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Island</HI> is in no parts
troubled with those <HI>storms</HI> of <HI>Wind</HI>
called <HI>Huricanes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Huri∣canes not in this Isle.</NOTE> which all the <HI>Ca∣ribbee
Isles</HI> are much pestered with,
having somtimes by the violence
of those <HI>Gusts,</HI> their <HI>Ships</HI> forced
out of their <HI>Roads;</HI> and on <HI>Shore,</HI>
their <HI>Houses</HI> blown down, and <HI>pro∣visions,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
&amp;c. rooted out of the
Earth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Weather.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Weather</HI> of this <HI>Isle</HI> is less
certain then in the rest of the <HI>Ca∣ribbee
Islands;</HI> the most observa∣ble
wett <HI>seasons</HI> are in <HI>November</HI>

<HI>Winter</HI> but by a little more
<HI>Rain,</HI> and <HI>Thunder,</HI> in the winter
months.</P>
<P>The winds here constantly blow
all the day from nine in the mor∣ning
easterly, and become more
fresher as the <HI>Sun</HI> mounteth
higher, by reason of which, at
midd-day <HI>Travel</HI> or <HI>Labour</HI> is suf∣ferable.
But from eight at <HI>Night</HI>
to about eight in the <HI>Morning,</HI> it
frequently blows Westerly; and
with these <HI>Winds,</HI> or <HI>Breezes,</HI> the
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<HI>Vessells</HI> get out of the <HI>Harbours,</HI>
and ply to wind-ward.</P>
<P>There is scarce any sencible
lengthning or shortning of the
<HI>Days</HI> or <HI>Nights,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dayes, &amp; Nights almost e∣qual.</NOTE> but are almost
alwayes of an equal length.</P>
<P>The Sea <HI>ebbs</HI> and <HI>flowes</HI> sel∣dome
above a foot.</P>
<P><HI>Hurricanes</HI> are here never
known, as before I have noted;
nor hath any <HI>Vessel</HI> been lost, or

that time you will have (besides

of <HI>Cocao-Trees</HI> in the ground;
which in less then 4. years, from
the Planting, will begin to bear
<HI>Cods,</HI> and in a year after, produce
compleat Cropps. And according
to experience, an <HI>Acre</HI> doth produce
every year about 1000. pound
<HI>Weight;</HI> which at <HI>Jamaica</HI> is worth
4 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> which for the 21 <HI>Acres,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
doth amount unto 840 <HI>l. per Ann.
Although</HI> this last year, by reason
their <HI>Cropps</HI> were blasted, it is at

<P>Note, that all this that is <HI>Plan∣ted,</HI>
is done in 15. <HI>months,</HI> and the

<HEAD>The state of the Spaniards
in this Island,</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> first setled on the
<HI>North-west</HI> part of the <HI>Isle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spa∣niards First set∣tlement.</NOTE> under
the Conduct of <HI>Columbus,</HI> and built
the Town of <HI>Mellila,</HI> but disliking
<PB N="44" REF="27"/>
the Scituation, removed to <HI>Orista∣na;</HI>
and finding that also to be ill
seated, and unhealthful, again re∣moved,
and setled at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> or
St. <HI>Jago de la vega,</HI> where, with
the assistance of the <HI>Indians,</HI> they
built a fair <HI>Town</HI> or <HI>City,</HI> which I
have already treated of. And in
this <HI>Town</HI> Inhabited all the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
that were in the <HI>Isle</HI> at the
Landing of the <HI>English,</HI> keeping
their slaves at their several small
<HI>Plantations,</HI> or <HI>Stanchas,</HI> who fail∣ed
not to bring them store of <HI>Fruits</HI>
&amp; <HI>Provisions,</HI> which they luxurious∣ly
spent in their houses, never in∣tending
any thing but to live at ease
and plenty:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spa∣niards inclined to Idle∣ness.</NOTE> For on this large and
fertile <HI>Island,</HI> there was no <HI>Manu∣facture</HI>
or <HI>Commodity</HI> made, except
a little <HI>Sugar, Tabacco,</HI> and <HI>Cocao,</HI>
and those few <HI>Ships</HI> that came hi∣ther,
traded generally for <HI>Hydes,
<PB N="45" REF="27"/>
Tallow, Jamaica Pepper,</HI> and <HI>Cocao,</HI>
but not to any considerable ac∣count.
And the number of In∣habitants
did not exceed 3000, of
which, half (if not more) were
<HI>Slaves.</HI> And the reason why it
was so thinly peopled, was, be∣cause
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> generally de∣sire
to be in <HI>Nova Hispana,</HI> or <HI>His∣paniola;</HI>
but chiefly, because this
<HI>Isle</HI> was held▪ in proprietership, by
the heirs of the Duke of <HI>Veragua-Columbus,</HI>
who received the Re∣venues,
and placed <HI>Governours,</HI> as
absolute Lord of it. And at the
first, it was planted by a kind of <HI>Por∣tugals,</HI>
the society of whom, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> abhors.</P>
<P>Upon the approach of the <HI>En∣glish-Army</HI>
after their landing, the
<HI>Inhabitants</HI> of St. <HI>Jago</HI> deserted
the <HI>Town,</HI> and betook themselves
to the <HI>Mountains,</HI> pretending a
<PB N="46" REF="28"/>
Treaty with the <HI>English,</HI> untill such
time as they had secured their <HI>Wo∣men</HI>
and <HI>Goods,</HI> and then did they
make several attempts, and upon
surprisals, murthered many of the
<HI>English;</HI> but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> soon
growing weary of that wild and
mountainous course of Life, per∣ceiving
small hopes of expelling
the <HI>English,</HI> divers of the <HI>Grandees</HI>
got into <HI>Cuba,</HI> who by the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI>
of <HI>Alexico</HI>'s order, were com∣manded
back, with a promise of
a speedy and considerable supply
of men; upon which they returned,
somwhat encouraged, and disper∣sed
themselves by <HI>Families,</HI> that
they might the better get <HI>provisi∣ons,</HI>
and avoid the being discover∣ed
by the <HI>English;</HI> but this necessi∣tous
and unusual course of life, kil∣led
many of them, and discouraged
the rest; for that in all this time
<PB N="47" REF="28"/>
there came to their succour, but
too <HI>Souldiers,</HI> and those refused
to joyn with them, as being so few
and sickly; so that they marched
back to the <HI>North</HI> of the <HI>Island,</HI>
and at a place called St. <HI>Chereras,</HI>
did fortify themselves, every day
expecting a new body of Men to
joyn with them: But the <HI>English</HI>
discovering their <HI>quarters,</HI> march∣ed
against them. Some few months
after, about 30 small <HI>Companies</HI>
of the <HI>Spanish Forces</HI> arrives, and
immediately very strongly Fortify
<HI>Rio Nova,</HI> having <HI>Ordnance,</HI> and
great store of <HI>Ammunition,</HI> yet
were they speedily and succesfully
defeated by the Valour of the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
under the Conduct of Leiute∣nant
General <HI>Edw. D'oyley.</HI> And
this grand disaster, with many pet∣ty
ill successes caused the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
to dispair of regaining the <HI>Island,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="29"/>
and to ship off most of their <HI>Plat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
and <HI>Women;</HI> and the <HI>Negroes</HI> find∣ing
the greatest part of their Ma∣sters
to be dead, killed the <HI>Gover∣nour,</HI>
and declined all obedience to
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> appointing a <HI>Black</HI>
for their <HI>Governour.</HI> And such
was the necessity of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
that instead of giving them fitting
correction, they were constrained
to Court them for their assistance;
but all their policy would not pre∣vail
upon them, for soon after did
they submitt to the <HI>English Gover∣ment,</HI>
and made discoveries of the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Negroes</HI> that would
not come in with them, and did
further assist the <HI>English</HI> in the ta∣king
of them, in which they have
been exceeding succesful.</P>
<P>In the year following, the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
quite deserted the <HI>Island,</HI>
except it were about 30 or 40 of
<PB N="49" REF="29"/>
their <HI>Slaves,</HI> who betook them∣selves
to the <HI>Mountaines,</HI> but be∣ing
afraid of a Discovery, and to
be pursued to Death for some <HI>Mur∣thers</HI>
they had committed, built
themselves <HI>Conoas,</HI> and in them
fled to <HI>Cuba,</HI> and never since hath
any considerable attempt been
made upon them.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> being thus become
Masters of the <HI>Island,</HI> formed them∣selves
into a Body, or Colony:
Then did they they begin to set∣tle
themselves in <HI>Plantations,</HI>
whilst others betook themselves
to the Sea as <HI>Freebooters</HI> or <HI>Pri∣vateers,</HI>
the better to secure them∣selves
against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and
force them to a peace by their
frequent annoying them, in seizing
such their ships which they could
meet with, which proved very
succesful unto them. And this
<PB N="50" REF="30"/>
caused the <HI>Isle</HI> to be much talked
of, and had in esteem by the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
who sent them supplies of
Men, Provisions, and necessaryes.

to be so potent as now it

have been often forced forth to <HI>Sea,</HI>

ply to any of the outward <HI>Caribbee
Islands,</HI> but have been constrained
to bear up, and put into the <HI>Spanish
Leeward Ports;</HI> and likewise, some
of our <HI>Merchants</HI> have been forced
out of the <HI>Caribbee Isles</HI> by <HI>Hurri∣cane</HI>'s
(which are there common)
and so disabled, that they could not
keep <HI>Sea,</HI> but (as all <HI>Vessels</HI> thus
distressed) have put into some of
the <HI>Spanish Leeward Ports,</HI> where
they have alwayes, been made
<HI>Prizes.</HI> Now, <HI>Jamaica</HI> being
so far <HI>Leeward,</HI> is a conveni∣ent

these <HI>Commodities,</HI> especially <HI>Su∣gar,

although the people do so much
sweat, yet they have not that faint∣ness
as with us, in the months of

so thirsty, without occasioned by
excess of <HI>Labour,</HI> or <HI>Drinking</HI> of

strong <HI>Liquors,</HI> which the <HI>People</HI>
are here too much addicted unto,

<P>The <HI>Air,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air moist.</NOTE> though hot, is very

It is thought by many, that the

being murthered by the <HI>Negro-Slaves,</HI>
who so much over-top
them in number, and the rather,
for that they are so cruelly used,
and for that reason, many are fear∣ful
to venture to dwell here. But
this Objection may be thus an∣swered;
that first, they are such
as were brought from several parts
of <HI>Africa,</HI> and do not understand
one anothers Language; and then
they are stir'd up with an inb-read
hatred against one another, it be∣ing
the custome in those parts, for
several petty <HI>Kings</HI> to go to Wars
against one another; and the <HI>Pri∣soners</HI>
that are taken of each side,
they sell unto us, and other <HI>Euro∣pean
Nations</HI> that come to <HI>Traf∣fique</HI>
with them; also, they are not
permitted to touch, nay, hardly to
<PB N="92" REF="52"/>
see a <HI>Gun,</HI> or any other <HI>weapon;</HI> and
being kept in such a <HI>slavery,</HI> they
are fearful of begining such an In∣surrection,
it being present death

found to act, or contrive such a
thing.</P>
