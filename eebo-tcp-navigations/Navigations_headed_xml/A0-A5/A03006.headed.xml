<HEAD>A true Relation of the Frenche <HI>Kinge his good successe, in winning from</HI> the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> his forts and trenches, and slaieng 500. of his men, and the great famine that is now in the sayd Dukes Campe.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Ost true it is which the A∣postle saint <HI>Paule</HI> in the 13. to the <HI>Romans</HI> auoucheth of Kinges and Princes, sai∣eng there is no power but of God, and the powers that bee are ordained by God. And no lesse true is that Golden sayeng of the princelie Prophet Dauid, speking in the person of God: by me kinges rule, and by me doo princes exercise authoritie.</P>
<P>Then it followeth necessarilie, that as kings and princes vppon earth are the ordinance of God, (and therefore those that do resist or re∣bell against them doo resist the power of God, and purchase to themselues eternall damnati∣on,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> as the same Apostle beareth record: so the Lord will, and dailie dooth (as wee see by ex∣perience euery daye) blesse the same his ordi∣naunce, confounding, scattering, and disper∣sing the practises, or rather the trecherous con∣spiraces of all those that rise vp against his an∣nointed.</P>
<P>Which thing the Lord hath moste notablie perfourmed euen the last day vpon the French King, that valiant souldiar of his, giuing vnto him most happie and fortunate successe against the Duke of <HI>Parma.</HI> VVho albeit he be other∣wise a man of puissance and valor, yet the Lord our God (blessed be his holie name therfore) to manifest to the worlde, how muche his at∣tempt in aiding the rebellious Leaguers, a∣gainst their Soueraigne Kinge and liege Lord, dooth displease him, he crosseth him in his ac∣tions, and as it were standeth before him, and fighteth against him, sometimes striking a sud∣daine terror and feare into his heart, with the rest of his complices, and other-sometimes o∣uerthrowing them altogither in their owne plats and deuises, according to the sayeng of the Psalmist, The wicked hath digged a pitte for others, but is fallen into it himselfe.</P>
<P>But to come to the matter, as it pleased god it fell out thus.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> hauing now the second or third time inuaded the kingdom of France
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> with a puissant and mightie Armie, with in∣tent to aide the rebellious Leaguers, agaynste their lawfull Kinge, passing the confines, and entring (as it were) into the bowelles of the Realme, approched with his armie neere vnto the Cyttie <HI>Roane,</HI> who beeing pursued by the King and his people, drew himselfe farther off towardes <HI>Newhauen,</HI> and there hee incamped himselfe, raising most strong Fortes, and erec∣ting (as hee thought) trenches inuincible for his owne and his souldiers better defence: yea so stronglie had he intrenched himselfe there, planting ordinance, Baricadoes, and other mi∣litarie munition of infinite varietie, that hee thought himselfe not onelye able to counter∣uaile what strength the king should be able to bende against him, but also he supposed him∣selfe to be in effect inexpugnable.</P>
<P>But as the prophet <HI>Esaias</HI> saith, there is no wisedome, there is no pollycie, there is no po∣wer, nor strength against the Lord, nor against his annointed.</P>
<P>For the King by secret intelligences or spi∣als, beeing aduertised of the Duke his procee∣dings, and how stronglie he had fortified him selfe in Trenches and bulwarks, with all possi∣ble speed marched towardes him, taking with him such a competent number of horssemen, and footmen, as he thought sufficient to with∣stand the forces of the aduersarie.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P>Being come somewhat neere the place, he caused his armie to march forwarde both lea∣surelie and aduisedlie, the better to preuent se∣cret ambushes: and viewing with prouidente eie the manner of his enimies lyeng, their Fortes, their trenches, and other their muny∣tions, at the last with mature aduise, and most peremptorie resolution (as one that fighteth the Lords battels) in most fierce manner assai∣led his enimies on euerie side.</P>
<P>And albeit the fight was both long and cru∣ell, and seemed a great while to hang in equall ballance, neither inclining vnto the one nor to the other, yet it pleased God, who continually fighteth for his seruantes, that the Kinge pre∣uayled.</P>
<P>And although he had not in his band so ma∣nie as the Enimie was by oddes, yet he wanne the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> his Fortes and Trenches, mauger the heads of all his enimies, and for∣ced his men to flie back and to retire to a more narrower place, beeing constrained to fortifie themselues anew, in such place as they coulde get on the suddaine, and it is verilye thought that they can not be able to holde out longe against the forces of the King.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> also (such was the migh¦tie hand of God against him) not onelye loste his fortes and trenches, but 500. of his chiefest souldiers also, besides other munition &amp; great
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> spoiles.</P>
<P>The Duke is nowe presentlie so driuen to the wall, and so corbed vp, al hope of new sup∣plies of viandes or victuals, being in some sorte intercepted and cut off from him, that he with his whole armie are so sore assailed with famin, as that they are forced to eate their horsses for verie hunger.</P>
<P>Thus haste thou heard Gentle Reader the noble exploits of that valiant King of France, with his good successe (which God continue:) and the present state of the duke of <HI>Parma</HI> with his retinue, whose hande the Lorde of Hostes shorten, and strengthen that illustrious and re∣noumed French King, that he may fighte the Lords Battels still, that once (if it be his blessed will) poperie, superstition and Idolatrie maye bee cleane rooted out, and true religion maie vniuersally be planted in all Christian Kinge∣domes of the world, Amen.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Gospel of S. Mathew, the 24. Chapter, our sauiour Christ telleth vs of many signes and tokens, which shal be sent vnto vs and appeare before the day of iudgment, as that the sonne shalbe darkened, the Moone shall loose hir light, the Starres shall fall from heauen, the earth shall tremble, and shake vn∣der vs, the hilles shalbe supplanted and remo∣ued out of their places: the Seas shall roare and make a hideous noyse, there shall be wars and rumours of warres in all countries, and such like. All which signes and tokens we see to be come to passe alreadie. For if wee take
<PB N="14" REF="9"/> the sonne in that place, for the sonne of God Christ Iesus (as all sound expositions and in∣terpretors haue done:) howe often haue wee seene him darkened, and obscured with the filthy mistes, and stincking vapors of mens tra∣ditions. The Moone that is the Churche of God, how was shee darkened, yea almost de∣priued of her light vnder the tyrannie of An∣techrist the pope of Rome and his shauelings? The Starres, that is the pastors, and ministers of the Church, how were they driuen away a∣mongst the Papistes, from the firmament of sounde doctrine, and pure conuersation. But if we take these signes literally, howe ma∣nie times haue we seene the sunne and moone to be eclipsed, and almost manie times to lose their whole light. What woonderfull and strange coniunctions of Starres of signes and plannets, threatning euen an vniuersall con∣summation of all things haue we seene of late yeares. The like was neuer seen of many yeares before. What firie meteers, blasing Starres, Comets, and other fearefull impressions haue we seene in the ayre of late yeers? What inun∣dations and ouerflowings of the seas and wa∣ters? What fearefull earthquakes? What remo∣uing of hilles out of their places? What Abor∣tiues, fearefull and monstrous birthes? What warres and rumours of warres in all countries, doe we heare of in these daies? All which are
<PB N="15" REF="9"/> infallible tokens, and apparant arguments that the day of iudgement is at hand, and as it were before the dores. But although the Lord our God hath and doth dayly as well by these signes and tokens aboue named, and the like, as also by others of infinite varietie, summon vs to the doome, and warneth vs to be alwaies readie and prepared, yet hath hee not in anie age, nor to anie people, sent a more fearefull, strange, or woonderfull example (as it were a warning or caueat to all the world) then this that followeth, the trueth whereof was thus.</P>
<P>There is a certaine Iland called <HI>Palme</HI> nere to the <HI>Ingenio</HI> of <HI>Tertia</HI> court, three leagues from the Citie, and a league and a halfe from the sea side, wherein grewe a certaine moun∣tain or hil of three hundred faddam in height, and a league and a halfe in compasse. This mountaine or hill, the 19. of May beganne to burne, and so continued still burning till the 19. of Iulie next after, in most strange and fear∣full maner.</P>
<P>Vpon the top of which hill there seemed to be a great caue or gulfe: whereat issued out great flames of fire; burning in suche forcible and vehement maner, as they raised vp withall and cast foorth huge and mightie stones into the ayre, stinging them vp with great violence, which stones at the length descending downe againe foorth of the ayre, fell downe at the
<PB N="16" REF="10"/> foote of the same hill. And yet notwithstand∣ing that it continually burned in this sort, and cast forth infinite great and monstrous stones, yet the said hill remained still in all mens iudg∣ments as bigge as it was before. The heate of which fire was such, and so great that the inha∣bitants thereabouts were sore annoyed there∣by, hauing their vineyards and their corn scor∣ched and burnt vp thorow the rage and vyo∣lence of the flames of fire that issued thereout. And in this sorte it continued vntill the 20. of Iulie about midnight at which time the sayd mount or hill, brake in sunder, and shiuered in peeces, caused such great cracks and roringes, as though it had thundered, or a hundred can∣nons had beene shot off, to the great terror of the hearers.</P>
<P>It beeing thus disseuered and broken, con∣tinued burning: And burning (contrarye to the nature thereof before) consumed and wa∣sted, till it came to be as it were a great coale of fire, from which cole there seemed to ascende and to rise vppe into the aire as it were great mountaines of smoke and sparkles of fire, as bigge in appearance as little barrels, and so at the laste the whole mountaine consumed and burned away.</P>
<P>There gushed also foorth of the sayd moun∣taine (before it was consumed) great streames of water, burning like oile in the fire, and cast∣ing
<PB N="17" REF="10"/> vp woonderfull flames into the aire, which entred into the Sea fourty faddame, makinge all the water thereabout so extreame hot, as it melted the pitch and rosine wherewith the Fi∣shers botes were pitched.</P>
<P>The heat of this burning water was such, as it scalded and killed all the fishe neere therea∣bouts, so that aboundance of fishe of all sortes was found dead many dayes after.</P>
<P>From this mountaine also there tumbled downe to the Sea-side, beeing distante from thence a league and a halfe three mighty great stones, one of them being 25. faddom in com∣passe, and with a woonderfull violence threw themselues into the Sea fiftie faddame at the least.</P>
<P>The hill being in this sort quite consumed, the second of August next following there rai∣ned downe foorth of the aire, as it had beene whole shewers of blacke ashes, like gunpow∣der in bignesse, which spoiled and consumed all the Corne, grasse, and vines in the whole countrey about.</P>
<P>After this, namelie the fourth of August, it rained againe great store of white ashes in the Cittie, the streets being so thicke couered ther∣with as the people coulde not trauaile about their necessarie businesse. Immediatlie after this: to wit, the fourth of September folowing, there appeared ouer the same Iland in the aire,
<PB N="18" REF="11"/> other strange and wonderfull sights, as name∣ly armed men to the number (as a man would haue thought) of 40000, one fighting againste another in most cruell &amp; bloudie maner, with such fearefull thundering, and terrible lighte∣ning, as the like was neuer heard nor seen be∣fore. The people seeing these strange sightes, and feareful wonders, called to God for mer∣cie: repented of their sinnes, and instantlye besought the Lord that he would not enter in∣to iudgement with them, nor punish them ac∣cording to their desertes: whiche done, the Lord in mercy withdrew his plagues, and pu∣nishmentes, (messengers of his wrath) from them, and receiued them to mercie. Thus hast thou heard courteous Reader, the true narra∣tion of the wonderfull iudgementes of God against this people. The Lord giue both them and vs all grace, to make profite of them, and to amend our liues, that we may altogether in the great day of the Lord receiue the crown of euerlasting glorie, promised vnto vs tho∣rough Iesus Christ our Lord, Amen.</P>
