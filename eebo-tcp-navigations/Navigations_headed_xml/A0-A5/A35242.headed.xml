<P>THis Relation comming to my Hands, I thought it might be some Diversion, to Observe what the Ig∣norant are made to Believe, of those once Famous Places.</P>
<P>And though others have for∣merly Treated of these Parts, yet we have hardly had an Exact Account since Mr. <HI>Sandys,</HI> which being so long since, No doubt some things are Altered, some Worn out of Memory, and it may be, many more <HI>Legends</HI> Added, Ac∣cording as it may stand with the Interest and Profit of the Priests.</P>
<P><PB REF="5" MS="y"/>
If the Stile be not so Polite and Curious, as might be Wisht, I dare Assure the Reader that the Author never intended it for Pub∣like Veiw, but Writ it only as a Letter, to satisfy the desire of his Intimate Friends; wherein Men do not commonly so much Study Elloquence, as plainess and Truth; The last whereof I Suppose the Author is Guilty of, because he had no Temptation to do Other∣wise; for I think it is not much Material to him, whether it be Be∣lieved or noe. And therefore you may Read, and Judg of it as you Please.</P>

<HEAD>A Brief Description of <HI>Palestine,</HI> with an Ac∣count of the Ancient and Modern State of those Countries.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N Former Ages, this was One of the most Famous∣est Provinces of <HI>Sy∣ria:</HI> Called,</P>
<P>First, The Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> from <HI>Canaan</HI> the Son of <HI>Cham,</HI> who by his often Cha∣sings
<PB REF="6"/>was driven to Possess and Inhabite the same.</P>
<P>Secondly, It was called the <HI>Land of Promise,</HI> because the Lord had Promised it to the Pa∣triarcks, <HI>Abraham, Isaack</HI> and <HI>Ja∣cob,</HI> and their Seed.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Jsrael,</HI> of the <HI>Israe∣lites,</HI> so called from <HI>Jacob,</HI> who was Sur-named <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Judea,</HI> from the <HI>Jews,</HI> or People of the Tribe of <HI>Juda.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Palestine,</HI> by <HI>Ptolo∣mays</HI> and others, <HI>quasi Philistini:</HI> The Land of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> a potent Nation that dwelt there.</P>
<P>Sixthly, The Holy Land, so Na∣med by the Christians, because herein was Wrought by <HI>Christ,</HI> the Work of our Salvation.</P>
<P>This Country is Situated in
<PB REF="6"/>the midst of the World, Be∣tween the Third and Fourth Cli∣mates, the longest Day being Fourteen Hours and a quarter, be∣tween the <HI>Midland Sea</HI> and <HI>A∣rabia,</HI> from which it is Bulwar∣ked beyond <HI>Jordan</HI> with a con∣tinual Ridg of Mountaines; on the East lyes <HI>Celosgoia,</HI> and <HI>A∣rabia Petrea;</HI> on the South <HI>Idu∣mea,</HI> the Wilderness of <HI>Pharam</HI> and <HI>Egypt;</HI> in the West a part of <HI>Phenicia,</HI> and the rest, hath the <HI>Mediterranean-Sea;</HI> and on the North are the Mountaines of <HI>Libanus,</HI> and a part of <HI>Pheni∣cia:</HI> It is distant from the Equi∣noctial Thirty one Degrees, exten∣ding to Thirty Three; so that in length from <HI>Dan</HI> unto <HI>Bersheba,</HI> it containeth not more then Four Hundred Miles; and where
<PB REF="7"/>it is Broadest, not Fifty.</P>
<P>This Famous Land was once commended above all Coun∣tries under the Sun, especial∣ly in regard of the Salubritie and Wholsomeness of the Ayr, being Seated under a Tempe∣rate Clime, where the Win∣ter is not too Cold, nor the Summer too Hot; and for Fer∣tility, a Land that Floweth with Milk and Hony, Adorned with Beautified Mountaines, and de∣lightful Valleys; the Rock pro∣ducing Excellent Waters, and no part empty of Delight or Profit; for the Soyle yeilds abundance of all Fruits and In∣crease.</P>
<P>This Land aboundeth in sweet Springs, and pleasant Pastures; where they feed a great many
<PB REF="7"/>Flocks of Sheep, and herds of Cattle and Cowes which give excellent Milk as is in any Country in the World; There is also brave Hunting and Hawking; for Deere, Goats, Hares, Partridges, Quailes, and other Birds: Likewise, they have all kind of Fowle, also there are great store of Lyons, Beares and Wolves, found in Abundance.</P>
<P>The Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was heretofore divided into Thirty Kingdomes, and Kings when the <HI>Israelites</HI> Conquered it; the most of the Ancient inhabitants being for their Sins by God Ex∣cluded the Land, and put to the Sword by the <HI>Israelites:</HI> The <HI>Is∣raelites</HI> Ruled this Land, about Foure Hundred Years, by Prin∣ces and Judges, till the time of
<PB REF="8"/><HI>Samuel:</HI> These Princes or Judges, were not all of one Tribe, but the Best, Gravest, and Eldest, were Selected, and Chosen out of every Tribe. Afterwards the <HI>Israelites</HI> growing weary of this Government, at their Earnest re∣quest, the Lord appointed them a King, and so their Government was Changed into a <HI>Monarchie,</HI> which continued many Ages; but in process of time, the <HI>Israe∣lites</HI> endured many Miseries, and Afflictions, till at last they saw the utter Ruine and subvertion of their Kingdome.</P>
<P>What Alteration hapened to this Nation, and with how ma∣ny several Wars they were Pla∣gued (either because of their own stifneckedness, that they would not be Obedient to their
<PB REF="8"/>own Prince, or brook any for∣reign Government, or that for their Rebellion and Sins, the Wrath of God was oftentimes Kindled against them; or that Forreigne Princes were Ambi∣tious to Incorporate this happy Land, Holy Writ and <HI>Histori∣graphers</HI> Witness the same at large; for how many times were they Subdued and brought into Slavary, and Bondage, because of their Sins, and that they did not Govern and behave themselves well? for sometimes their Necks were brought under the Yoakes of their Neighbours, as the <HI>E∣gyptians, Caldeans, Meads, Per∣sians, Macedonians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> yea, and would never cease by their Rebellions, Seditions, and Conspiracies, till they had
<PB REF="9"/>brought their Government and Countrey to utter Destruction, by Persecuting and putting to Death, the Saints and Prophets, sent them from God; yea, and at last Crucifying the Son of God, the Lord of Glory, and the Saviour of Man-kind, by their Horrible and Murderous Hands, and Nailing him to the Cross.</P>
<P>And finally, wishing that his In∣nocent Bloud should be on them and their Children;</P>
<P>Which accordingly soon after happened to the utter Desolation of their Countrey, the <HI>Romans</HI> laying wast, and levelling to the Ground, the Magnificent Struct∣ures and Buildings thereof, de∣stroying and burning <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the Temple, and all the Orna∣ments
<PB REF="9"/>thereof; so that herein was verified the Prophecy of Christ while he was upon the Earth, <HI>that one Stone should not be left upon Another.</HI></P>
<P>And as for the People, Di∣vine Venegance did continually pursue them till the most part of them were destroyed, and the rest Dispersed through out the World, even to this Day.</P>
<P>For First, The Inhabitants of <HI>Cesarea</HI> slew of the <HI>Jews</HI> in one Day, about Twenty Thousand, and such as fled, were taken and Imprisoned by <HI>Florus</HI> the Leiu∣tenant of <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>To Revenge this Slaughter, the <HI>Jews</HI> set upon the <HI>Syrians;</HI> in which Skirmish Thirteen Thou∣sand of them were Slain. The People of <HI>Alexandria</HI> put Fifty
<PB REF="10"/>Thousand of them to the Sword; They of <HI>Damascus</HI> ten Thousand of them: and <HI>Antonius</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Captain, slew in <HI>Ascalon</HI> Ten Thousand; and <HI>Cestius</HI> another Captain, slew Fourscore Thou∣sand and Forty Persons. And now to come to the Wars man∣naged here by <HI>Vespasian.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Vespasion,</HI> in the Seige of <HI>Aphaca,</HI> slew and took Prisoners Seventeen Thousand, One Hun∣dred and Thirty Persons: in <HI>Sama∣ria</HI> Eleaven Thousand Six Hun∣dred Persons: and in <HI>Josepata</HI> Forty two Thousand two Hun∣dred Persons. In <HI>Joppa</HI> so ma∣ny Killed and Drowned them∣selves, that the Sea threw up again Four Thousand two Hundred Per∣sons; and the rest so totally pe∣rished, that there remained none
<PB REF="10"/>to carry tydings to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> of the loss of the Town.</P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Tarichea,</HI> were Slain and made Captives, Forty five Thousand Persons, besides those which were given to the King <HI>Agrippa:</HI> In <HI>Gamala</HI> there perish∣ed Ninety Thousand, and none were left alive but only two Wo∣men. In <HI>Gascala</HI> Five Thousand Men died by the Sword. In the City of <HI>Gadara,</HI> there were Slain Thirty two Thousand two Hun∣dred, besides an infinite number of such as Drowned themselves. In <HI>Jerusalem</HI> it self, there Died Eleven Hundred Thousand of them, partly by the Sword, and partly by Famine, the worse E∣nemy of the two; there were found two Thousand in Privies and Sinks; and Ninety Seaven
<PB REF="11"/>Thousand were taken prisoners, insomuch, that thirty <HI>Jews</HI> were sold for a Peny.</P>
<P>Now that <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was able to contain such a number of Peo∣ple, is evident, in that when <HI>Cestius</HI> was Leiuetenant of <HI>Jury,</HI> the high Priest did, at his Re∣quest, number the People, which came to Eat of the <HI>Paschal</HI> Lamb, and found them to be two Mil∣lions, and Seven Hundred Thou∣sand living Souls, all Sound and Purified.</P>
<P>And when <HI>Titus</HI> laid Seige to the City, it was at the Feast of the Passeover, when most of the People were there Assembled; God as it were thus Imprisoning them.</P>
<P>All these Massacres, besides di∣vers others Omitted, and infinite
<PB REF="11"/>Numbers which were Slain in the Feilds and Villages, which Drow∣ned themselves, and were pri∣vately made away, Amounting to almost two Millions of Peo∣ple, happened in the compass of foure Years, beginning in the twelse of <HI>Nero,</HI> and ending in the second of <HI>Vespasian.</HI></P>
<P>Yet was not the whole Nati∣on Rooted out till the Year One Hundred Thirty Six. For then this Miserable People having stir∣red two notable Rebellions, First under <HI>Trajan,</HI> and asterward under <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperours, they were generally Banished their Native Countrey, and never again suf∣fered to inhabit it, but as Stran∣gers.</P>
<P>After this Desolation, the <HI>Jews</HI> were dispersed all over the World,
<PB REF="12"/>and especially in <HI>Spain,</HI> where <HI>Adrian</HI> Commanded many of them to dwell; yet they found every where so little Favour, that having divers times been put to greivous Mulcts and Ransomes, they were at last quite t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rust out of <HI>Europe</HI> also.</P>
<P>The First Christian Prince that expelled the <HI>Jews</HI> out of his Territories, was that Heroick King, our <HI>Edward</HI> the First, who was such a sore Scowrge also to the <HI>Scots;</HI> and it is thought, di∣vers Families of those Banished <HI>Jews</HI> fled then to <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they have propagated since in great Numbers; Witness the A∣version this Nation hath above others to Hogs-Flesh.</P>
<P>Nor was this their Extermi∣nation for their Religion, but for
<PB REF="12"/>their notorious Crimes; as poi∣soning of Wells, Counterfeiting of Coins, falsifying of Seals, and Crucifying of Christian Chil∣dren; with other Villanies. This happened in the Year One Thou∣sand Two Hundred Ninety One.</P>
<P>And Sixteen Years after, <HI>France</HI> followed our Example.</P>
<P>It was neer two Hundred Years after, that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> turn'd them out of <HI>Spain;</HI> and five years after him, <HI>Emanual</HI> of <HI>Por∣tugal</HI> did the like.</P>
<P>But the Countreys from whence they were Last expelled, were <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> in the Year One Thousand Five Hundred Thirty Nine. In other parts of Chri∣stendome they reside yet, in great numbers, as in <HI>Germany</HI> High and Low; <HI>Bohemia, Lituania,
<PB REF="13"/>Poland</HI> and <HI>Russia;</HI> In <HI>Italy</HI> also they are found, but in no Coun∣trey which is subject to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>They live very quietly at <HI>Rome</HI> under the Popes nose, and St. <HI>Mark</HI> makes no Scruple to entertain them at <HI>Venice:</HI> In sun∣dry places of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire they are found very numerous; so that it is thought <HI>Constanti∣nople</HI> and <HI>Thessalonica</HI> only, have near upon twenty Thousand of them.</P>
<P><HI>Asia</HI> is full of them, as <HI>Aleppo, Tripoly, Damascus, Rhodes,</HI> and in∣deed all places of commerce and Traffique; There are numbers of themifound also in <HI>Persia, Arabia,</HI> and about <HI>Cranganor</HI> in <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>And to come to <HI>Affrick,</HI> they have their Synagogues and Lum∣bards
<PB REF="13"/>bards, in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> the <HI>Gran Cairo,</HI> as also in <HI>Fesse,</HI> in <HI>Tre∣miseu,</HI> and divers places in the Kingdome of <HI>Morocco:</HI> there are about one hundred Families left in <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> But the place where they are most unmingled, is <HI>Tibe∣rias,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> gave to <HI>Mendez</HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> for some signal services; thither they oftentimes bring or send the bones of their dead freinds, who have left large Legacies to be there interred from other places.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was af∣terward re-edified by <HI>Elius A∣drianus,</HI> and given to the Christi∣ans, from whom it was taken by <HI>Cosroes,</HI> and the <HI>Presians,</HI> in the Year Six Hundred Fifteen, and from them forcibly wrested by <HI>Hau∣mar,</HI> and the <HI>Saracens,</HI> in the Year
<PB REF="14"/>Six Hundred Thirty Seven. Next it fell into the power of <HI>Cutlu Moses,</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> in the Year One Thousand Nine; under whose oppression, when it had long groa∣ned, <HI>Peter</HI> the Hermit stirred up the <HI>Westerne</HI> Princes to relieve the distressed Christians, whose designs attained their wished effect, under the Banner of the Victorious Prince, <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bullen,</HI> in the Year One Thousand Ninety Nine. This <HI>Godfrey,</HI> for his merits, was to have been invested with the Royal Wreath of Majesty, which he denied, thinking it unfit to wear a Crown of Gold, where his Saviour had Worn a Crown of Thorns; yet for the Common good sake he accepted the Title; after whom
<PB REF="14"/>reigned these Christian Prin∣ces.</P>
<P>Second, <HI>Baldwin.</HI> Third, <HI>Baldwin</HI> the Second. Fourth, <HI>Fulk</HI> Earl of <HI>Anjou.</HI> Fifth, <HI>Bald∣win</HI> the Third. Six, <HI>Almerick.</HI> Seventh, <HI>Baldwin</HI> the Fourth. Eight, <HI>Baldwin</HI> the fifth. Ninth, <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Lusignan,</HI> the last King of <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> during whose time, <HI>Saladine</HI> the Sultan of <HI>Egypt,</HI> won the Kingdom, which his Successours defended against all invasions, till the Year One Thousand Five Hundred Seven∣teen, when <HI>Selinus</HI> the first Em∣perour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> added the Holy <HI>Land</HI> together with <HI>Egypt</HI> to his Empire: And so the whole Countrey of <HI>Palestine,</HI> with the City of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> are under the dominion of the <HI>Turk</HI> to this
<PB REF="15"/>day, and is inhabited by some <HI>Christians</HI> (who make a great benefit of shewing the Sepulcher of Christ) and of late Years also, by <HI>Moors, Arabians, Greeks, La∣tines, Turks, Jews,</HI> nay, I may safely, and probably say, with People of all Nations.</P>
<P>The whole Land containeth Four Regions, <HI>Idumea, Judea, Samaria,</HI> and <HI>Gallilee, Idumea,</HI> beginneth at Mount <HI>Cassius;</HI> or as some will, at the Lake <HI>Sirbon,</HI> reaching to the Eastward of <HI>Judea;</HI> The Cheif Cities are <HI>Maresa, Rhinocorura, Rapha, Antedon, Ascalon, Azotus,</HI> and <HI>Gaza.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Maresa</HI> was the birth-place of the Prophet <HI>Micha.</HI> Neer unto this town, <HI>Judas Machabeus</HI>
<PB REF="15"/>overthrew <HI>Gorgius, Rhinocorura, Rapha,</HI> and <HI>Atedon,</HI> are towns of no great note. Of <HI>Ascalon</HI> Sir <HI>George Sandis</HI> writeth thus in his travels, That it is a place now of no great Reckoning, more then that the <HI>Turk</HI> doth keep there a garri∣son: Venerable heretofore a∣mongst the heathen for the Tem∣ple of <HI>Dagon,</HI> and the Birth of <HI>Si∣miramis</HI> begotten of the Goddess <HI>Decreta,</HI> who enflamed with the love of a certaine youth, that Sacrificed unto her, and having by him a daughter, ashamed of her Incontinency did put him away, and Exposed the Child to the desarts, and Confounded with sorrow, threw her self into a lake re∣plenished which fish, adjoyning to the City: this <HI>Decreta</HI> is said to be that <HI>Dagon</HI> the Idol of
<PB REF="16"/>the <HI>Agrotonites</HI> mentioned in the Scripture, which signifieth the first of sorrow: who had her Temple close by the Lake, with her Image in the figure of a Fish, excepting the Face, which resembled a woman; But the Infant nourished by Doves, which brought her Milk from the pailes of the Pastures: after became the wise of <HI>Ninus,</HI> and Queen of <HI>Assyria;</HI> whereupon she was called <HI>Semi∣ramis,</HI> which signifieth a dove in the <HI>Syrian</HI> tongue: in memo∣rial whereof the Babylonians did bear a Dove in their En∣signes, confirmed by the Pro∣phesie of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> who fore∣telling of the devastation of <HI>Judea,</HI> Adviseth them to flee from the sword of the dove.</P>
<P><HI>Azotes,</HI> where was a Sumptuous
<PB REF="16"/>Temple built to the Lieutenant to <HI>Demetrius:</HI> eight miles beyond that stands <HI>Acharon</HI> or <HI>Ekron,</HI> where <HI>Belzebub</HI> was worshipped, to whom <HI>Ahaziah</HI> sent to enquire of his health.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Gaza</HI> or <HI>Aza,</HI> one of the five Principal Cities belong∣ing to the Palastines (called Phi∣listines in Scripture) <HI>Gaza</HI> sig∣nifieth Strong, and in the Per∣sian, language a Treasury; So said to be called by <HI>Cambyses,</HI> who Invading <HI>Egypt,</HI> sent thither the riches Purchased in that Warr; it was also called <HI>Constantia</HI> by the Emperour <HI>Constantine,</HI> first famous for the acts of <HI>Sampson,</HI> who lived about the time of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Warrs, whose force and fortunes are said to have given to the Poets their invention of
<PB REF="17"/><HI>Hercules,</HI> who lived not long be∣fore him: And it was afterwards famous for two Wounds there received by <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, and was then counted the Chief of <HI>Syria.</HI></P>
<P>Also there lyeth <HI>Joppa</HI> now <HI>Jafta,</HI> a Famous Mart Town, and a good Haven; where <HI>Jonah</HI> took Ship to fly to <HI>Tar∣sus,</HI> where <HI>Peter</HI> Raised <HI>Dorcas</HI> from Death to Life, and where he lying in the House of one <HI>Simon</HI> a Tanner, was in a Vi∣sion, Taught the Conversion of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> This City they report to have been built before the Flood. Here Reign∣ed <HI>Cepheus</HI> the Son of <HI>Phenix,</HI> whose Daughter <HI>Andromeda</HI> was by <HI>Perseus</HI> delivered from a Sea Monster, some of whose
<PB REF="17"/>Bones the people had wont to shew to Strangers, even till the Flourishing of the <HI>Romans:</HI> Here lyeth <HI>Gath</HI> also, the Coun∣try of the huge Giant <HI>Go∣liah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Judea</HI> is the Chiefest part of <HI>Palastina,</HI> and is of the same extent now, as it was when it was the Kingdome of <HI>Judea,</HI> and entertained the two great and Puissant Tribes of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Benjamin.</HI> It lyeth between the <HI>Midland-Sea</HI> and <HI>Lacus As∣phaltitis,</HI> or the <HI>Dead-Sea,</HI> and betwixt <HI>Samaria</HI> and <HI>Idumea:</HI> It took this name from the Tribe of <HI>Juda,</HI> in which lyeth the once famous City <HI>Jerusa∣lem.</HI></P>
<P>Besides <HI>Jerusalem</HI> also, there are in this Country divers o∣ther
<PB REF="18"/>Towns and famous Cities; as <HI>Jerico, Turris Stratonis,</HI> af∣terward named <HI>Cesarea; He∣bron</HI> formerly, now <HI>Arbea;</HI> al∣so <HI>Mambre;</HI> and <HI>Carioth;</HI> that is to say, a Town of four Men, the Birth - place of <HI>Judas Is∣cariot,</HI> who betrayed our Savi∣our Jesus Christ; <HI>Emaus,</HI> and divers others; and Beyond <HI>Jordan Makherus,</HI> a Town with a strong Castle: here stood also the Towns of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorah,</HI> which for their Sodomy and Abomination, were utterly de∣stroyed and consumed with Fire from Heaven; and lyes now buried in that Cursed Lake <HI>Asphalites;</HI> so named of the <HI>Bitumen</HI> where it Vo∣miteth; called also the Dead-Sea, perhaps in that it nourish∣eth
<PB REF="18"/>no living Creature, or for his heavy Waters hardly to be moved with any Wind; so Extream Salt, that whatso∣ever is thrown thereinto, not easily Sinketh: <HI>Vaspatian</HI> for a tryal, causeth divers to be Cast in bound Hand and Foot, who Floted Aloft, as if Sup∣ported by some Spirit. They say, that Birds, Flying over it fall in as if Inchanted or Suf∣focated with the Poyson of the Ascending Vapors. <HI>Samaria</HI> ly∣eth in the Midst, between <HI>Ju∣dea,</HI> and <HI>Gallilea;</HI> the Land is so called from the Metrapolis <HI>Samaria,</HI> Built by <HI>Amry</HI> King of <HI>Israel,</HI> and now called <HI>Se∣basta;</HI> which Towns in it, are <HI>Sichem,</HI> afterwards Named <HI>Ne∣apolis, Capernaum, Betzaida</HI> and <HI>Chorazin.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="19"/>
<HI>Galilea</HI> lyeth between <HI>Mount Labanus</HI> and <HI>Samaria,</HI> and is divi∣ded into upper and lower <HI>Galilea;</HI> Upper <HI>Galilea</HI> bordereth upon <HI>Ty∣rus,</HI> called otherwise <HI>Galilea-Gentium,</HI> or the Heathenish <HI>Ga∣lilea;</HI> Lower <HI>Galilea</HI> lyeth near unto the Lake of <HI>Tyberius,</HI> and to <HI>Nazareth:</HI> In it are the Towns of <HI>Naim, Cana, Nazareth</HI> and <HI>Gadara.</HI> The <HI>Holy Land</HI> is seated between two Seas, and the Ri∣ver <HI>Jordan;</HI> it hath within it many Navigable Lakes, and Meers, abounding with Fish; the River <HI>Jordan</HI> is called by the <HI>Hebrews, Jordan,</HI> and run∣neth through the Midst of this Countrey, dividing it into two Parts. St. <HI>Jerom</HI> Writeth that this River Springeth out of two Fountaines, not far di∣stant
<PB REF="19"/>one from the other; the one called <HI>Jor,</HI> the other <HI>Dan,</HI> shooting out like two Horns, which meeting together, make the Great River <HI>Jordan.</HI> The Chief Mountains in the Holy Land, are Mount <HI>Hermon,</HI> lying in the East part thereof, and Mount <HI>Tabor</HI> in the West, both of them being very Great and High, so that the other Hills about them, are but Armes and Branches of them: For the Mountaines <HI>Eball, Betheron, Mispa</HI> or <HI>Maspha,</HI> and <HI>Bethel,</HI> are reckoned under Mount <HI>Her∣mon, Gilboa, Gerezin, Sarona,</HI> and <HI>Mount-Carmel</HI> by the Sea side, are counted under Mount <HI>Tabor.</HI></P>
<P>There are also about <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> Mount <HI>Sion, Moriah,</HI>
<PB REF="20"/>Mount <HI>Olivet,</HI> Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> and others: Besides there are many Goodly Woods, and For∣rests, full of all kind of Deer, and many Wild Beasts.</P>
<P>In this Land, especially in about and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> there were many Stately and Magnificent Buildings, as Namely <HI>Mons Domus,</HI> and the Castle of the <HI>Jebusites,</HI> into which King <HI>Da∣vid</HI> brought the Ark of the Lord, where it remained till <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple was Fini∣shed. The remainders and Ru∣ines of these Buildings, are yet to be seen to this Day; yea, it is said, that in the ve∣ry Place, the Lord Christ Eat the <HI>Pascal</HI> Lamb with his Disciples: There are also to be seen, the Sepulchers of King
<PB REF="20"/><HI>David,</HI> and other Kings of <HI>Ju∣da;</HI> there stood also the House of <HI>David,</HI> which yet retaineth the Name of <HI>Davids</HI> Tower. Upon Mount <HI>Moriah</HI> are yet to be seen some remainders of <HI>Mello.</HI> Above all, we must call to mind the most Excellent and Beautiful Temple of King <HI>Solomon,</HI> upon which One Hun∣dred and Fifty Thousand Men Wrought Seven Years continu∣ally, till it was Finished. The Glory and Magnificency there∣of you may Read in the Scrip∣ture. The Temple of the Se∣pulcher at the first Building was highly Reverenced by the Christians of those parts, and even until this Day it is much resorted to, both by Pilgrims from all parts of the Romish
<PB REF="21"/>Church, and also by divers Gentlemen of the Reformed Churches; partly for Curiosi∣ty, and partly for Antiquity of the place. It is Farmed from the <HI>Turk,</HI> and kept by the <HI>Popes</HI> Creatures; whosoever is ad∣mitted to the sight of this Se∣pulcher, payeth Nine Crowns to the <HI>Turkish</HI> Officers: so that this Tribute is worth to the Grand Seignior, Eight Thousand Duccats Yearly.</P>
<P>And thus much briefly for the Description of the Holy Land, or Land of Promise.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNEY TO <HI>JERƲSALEM.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Aleppo.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>THese serve to Accompany an Account of my Jour∣ney to the</HI> Holy Land, <HI>for which I might refer you to others, who have given a most exact Relation of that Pil∣grimage,
<PB N="2" REF="24"/>yet according to your desires, I present you with this my Description.</HI></P>
<P>TUesday <HI>May</HI> 3. 1669. we set Sail from <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> with a <HI>N. E.</HI> wind on the <HI>Margaret, Tho. Middleton</HI> Commander, be∣ing fourteen English Men, (of the Factory of <HI>Aleppo</HI>) in Com∣pany; but being forced to re∣turn three times, by contrary Winds, by <HI>May</HI> 10. we arrived at <HI>Trippoly,</HI> whose Port is guar∣ded with six small Castles, near the Sea, and one great Castle upon the Land; and is defen∣ded from Tempests, on the West with Islands, and on the East, with a Cape of Land; so that none but a North wind can be
<PB N="3" REF="24"/>prejudicial to Ships in this Port: the Ground is stony, which forc'd the Captains to buoy up their Cables, the ships riding in six or seven Fathom Wa∣ter.</P>
<P>The Town is about a mile from the Marine, situated upon the shelf of a Hill, and hath one good Castle for its defence; the Town is ruinate, and there were few People to be seen, at that time, it being the time of making white Silk, most of the People being in their Gardens.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> Thirteen, after three days Treatment by the <HI>Consul</HI> (for <HI>English, French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>) with extraordinary Civility; about four of the clock in the after∣noon, we set forward for Mount
<PB N="4" REF="25"/><HI>Lebanon,</HI> and two hours Riding from <HI>Trippoly,</HI> we pitched our Tent at the Village <HI>Coffersinue;</HI> the Inhabitants are Christians, and live in houses made of Reeds, and Covered with Bush∣es; and the Rode to this Vil∣lage, is very good and pleasant, passing to it, through a Forrest of Olive Trees; and in the Val∣leys, are Gardens of Mulberries, with which they feed their Silk-Worms.</P>
<P>Friday <HI>May</HI> fourteenth, we de∣parted from <HI>Coffersinue,</HI> about four of the clock in the morning, passing in a good Rode, and through Plains sowed with Wheat: about six of the Clock, we passed over several Moun∣tains resembling Marble, if not
<PB N="5" REF="25"/>really so; from which we had a very good Prospect of the fruit∣fulness of the Valleys: between these Mountains, upon the ascent of an Hill, we came to a Foun∣tain where we break-fasted; at seven of the clock we rose from the Fountain, and having pas∣sed a very dangerous ragged Mountain, about nine of the Clock we came to <HI>Eden,</HI> a small Village, and extraordinary pleasantly seated, being sur∣rounded with Mulberries, Wal∣nuts, and other sorts of Trees; Walnut especially we found ve∣ry common on this Mount: we went to the <HI>Bishops</HI> House, a most miserable ruinated Cottage, where the <HI>Bishop</HI> coming to bid us welcome, appeared more like a
<PB N="6" REF="26"/>Dunghil-raker then a <HI>Bishop.</HI> We enquired whence this Village had its name, the <HI>Maronites</HI> (which generally inhabit the Mountains) say, this was the place where <HI>Adam</HI> commit∣ted the sin of Eating the For∣bidden Fruit; but the <HI>Bishop</HI> told us, it was in Heaven, where there were three Trees, <HI>Adam</HI> being forbidden to eat of one of them which wa the Fig-tree: but having eaten, he fell from Hea∣van, and fell among the <HI>Cedars</HI> (which are some two hours ri∣ding from the <HI>Bishops</HI> house), and there he began to till the Ground. But the <HI>Bishop</HI> being very Igno∣rant of these things, we forbear to enquire farther. The <HI>Bishops</HI> have great respect shewed them,
<PB N="7" REF="26"/>every one Kissing his Hand on their Knees bareheaded: in his House he hath a ruinate Church, with an Altar in it; and a little beyond his house, is a little Chappel, neer the head of the Rivolet that feeds his house with water, where we found many men with <HI>Frank</HI> names, which had continued there from the Year 1611.</P>
<P>Mid-day coming, the <HI>Bishop</HI> made what Preparation his house would afford for Dinner, killing two Kids, and a Goat, and giving us the best Wine the Mountain did afford, being a well relished Red and White Wine.</P>
<P>Night coming, after Sup∣per, we kiss'd his Hand; and next
<PB N="8" REF="27"/>morning, we being now but twelve in Company, went to take our leave of him, and made him a present of Livers, besides something to the ser∣vants, as is usual for Pilgrims that take this Voyage; two of our Company waiting our re∣turn at <HI>Trippoly.</HI></P>
<P>Saturday <HI>May</HI> the fifteenth, about five a Clock in the mor∣ning, we rose from thence, and a∣bout eight of the Clock we came to the <HI>Cedars;</HI> all that remain of them, being in a very small compass: We spent some time in cutting sticks, and setting our Names on the great Trees.</P>
<P>At this place there came to us the Captain of a Village, cal∣led <HI>Upshara,</HI> an hours riding from
<PB N="9" REF="27"/>the <HI>Caedars.</HI> In our way, as we returned; he envited us to Din∣ner at his Village, which we ac∣cepted of, and after dinner made him a Present; This man is a <HI>Maronite,</HI> and takes <HI>Caffar</HI> or Toll of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which pass that way with their Sheep and Oxen; he hath a hundred Soul∣diers under his Command, who are all Christians.</P>
<P>About two a clock we moun∣ted, and after three hours riding, we came to a mighty deep De∣scent, winding in and out, which is the way to the Patriark of the <HI>Maronites</HI> house, called <HI>Caunibone;</HI> it is a very good Convent, and lies under the Rocks, they have a Bell in the Church as in <HI>Europe,</HI> and goe
<PB N="10" REF="28"/>to their Devotions Morning and Evening: After we had kissed the Patriarks hand, we deman∣ded what was to be seen, and the Druggerman carried us to see <HI>St. Marene's</HI> Grot, of whom they recount this Story.</P>
<P><Q>That a <HI>Venetian,</HI> in the time that the <HI>Franks</HI> had the Coun∣trey, came with his wife and and one daughter to live there; and after some years, his Wife dying, he was resolved to goe into the Covent and live a reli∣gious life, and would therefore have his Daughter to leave him; but his perswasions could not prevail with her; but ra∣ther than leave her Father, she would put on mans Apparrel, and live a devoted life with
<PB N="11" REF="28"/>him also; which at last (though unwilling) he assented to (she being young and handsom;) there they lived very strictly for several years; afterward her Father dyed: And the lay Brothers and Fathers going out, as usually, to Till the ground; She seldome went with them, the Chief of the Convent keeping her at home (being much taken with such a handsome young man as he thought) whereupon they be∣gan to grumble, that St. <HI>Mar∣rene</HI> did not go with them; so that at last, to satisfy the <HI>Fratres,</HI> he was sent out to work among them near the Village <HI>Tursa:</HI> presently after, one of the young Virgins of that Vil∣lage
<PB N="12" REF="29"/>proving with Child, she came to the Convent, and laid it to the charge of St. <HI>Marrena;</HI> who was thereupon presently excommunicated, and lived a Religious life in the Grot neer the Convent, for the space of 7 years; and being then again ad∣mitted into the Covent, &amp; still continuing to live a very strict Life, he at length dyed; and the Fathers coming according to their Custome, to Anoint the Body, found that he was a Woman; whereupon they began to Cross themselves, and to beg Pardon for Ex∣communicating her; and have built an Altar in the Grot, and call it by the Name of St. <HI>Mar∣rena;</HI> as they have also in se∣veral
<PB N="13" REF="29"/>Grots thereabouts, in remembrance of the Religious Relicks of those that dwelt therein; and when they carry any body to see them, they presently fall down to Pray∣ers.</Q></P>
<P>About a League from the Convent, are two <HI>French-men</HI> that live a Hermits life, have∣ing Bread and Wine allowed them by the Patriark: Night comming on, we went to Sup∣per with the Patriark, the Bishop of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and two o∣ther Bishops, they having pro∣vided what the Place affor∣ded; At Supper they brought out a great Glass, which held neer two Quarts, with which the Old Man soon made him∣self
<PB N="14" REF="30"/>merry, it being their Cus∣tome to drink freely; He telling us, that that Glass had belon∣ged to the Convent more than one hundred Years, and that the <HI>Turks</HI> coming once to Ran∣sack the Convent, seeing this Glass, told one of the <HI>Fratres,</HI> if he could drink off that full of pure Wine, he would save the Convent; which one of them doing, the <HI>Turks</HI> went away admiring what sort of People they were.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> sixteen, We took our leave of the Patriark, and pre∣sented him with some Livers, as also to the poor <HI>Frasres,</HI> and other People that belonged to the Convent, and so took our Journey to <HI>Trippoly,</HI> having had
<PB N="15" REF="30"/>a fair review of those Moun∣taines, and the Countrey ad∣jacent, which is over-spread with many fair Villages, and hath many fruitful Vallyes sown with Corn, and great quantity of Mulberry Gardens; it being the general imploy∣ment of the Inhabitants to make Silk.</P>
<P>We Return to <HI>Trippoly</HI> to the Consuls House that Night, where after two dayes repose, and having been extraordinary well Treated, we took our leave of the Consul.</P>
<P><HI>May,</HI> eighteen, about mid∣night, we set sail for <HI>Joppa,</HI> with a good Wind; in the Morning we came in sight of <HI>Cape-Blan∣co,</HI> where the wind proving
<PB N="16" REF="31"/>contrary, we were forced to beat up and down for two days, before we could weather the Cape the wind coming good, we weatherd the Cape, and came in sight of <HI>Cape-Carmel,</HI> which two Capes make the Bay of <HI>Aerica,</HI> on which there is a Convent of white Friers, and there they shewd us <HI>Elishas</HI> Tomb. And three or four hours Sail fur∣ther, we came in sight of <HI>Cesarea,</HI> now Ruinate, and inhabited by a Company of Savage <HI>A∣rabs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> twenty three, we Arri∣ved at <HI>Joppa,</HI> which hath no harbour to defend Ships from Storms, but hath very good ground to Anchor in, about ten Fathom Water: It is a poor
<PB N="17" REF="31"/>Town, and hath one Castle to defend those ships that come in close to the Shore; the cheif Trade thereof, is Pot-ashes for Soap, and a few Cottons, and Cotton-Yarn, which the <HI>Franks</HI> bring from thence.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> twenty four, We Arri∣ved at <HI>Ramah,</HI> which is a plea∣sant Village; the great Trade of the Inhabitants is in Fil∣lado's; the People are poor, and the livelyhood of the Wo∣men is to Spin that Commodity: We were Treated there at the Convent, till a Messenger was dispatched to the Convent at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> for our Admittance to pass thither, because of some extravagant Stories that flew abroad, of the Plague raging
<PB N="18" REF="32"/>in the place from whence we came: our messenger returned back that night.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the twenty fifth, in the morning, we mounted to take our Journey for <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and baited at St. <HI>Jeroms</HI> Church a∣bout twelve of the Clock, to Eat what small provisions we had with us: and the heat of the Day being passed, we procee∣ded on our Journey; and about four of the Clock in the after∣noon we Arrived at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> at <HI>Joppa</HI> Gate; where we tar∣ried till the Druggerman of the Convent went to the <HI>Caddy</HI> for Licence for us to enter the City; which having obtained, and delivering up our Swords, and what other Armes we had,
<PB N="19" REF="32"/>to be carried to the Convent; we entred the City on Foot, and were conducted by the Durggerman to the <HI>Latines</HI> Con∣vent, with two or three Fa∣thers Accompanying us; we sound them at their Devotions, and afterwards we all went in∣to the Father <HI>Guardians</HI> Cham∣ber, who imbraced us, and bid us welcome; We were carried to our Lodgings, and the Fa∣ther Procurator came to us, and passed a Complement on us, bringing two or three bottles of the best Wine, and desiring us to call for what we wanted; this was our first Entertain∣ment.</P>
<P>But I should have given you an Account that our Drugger∣man,
<PB N="20" REF="33"/><HI>Mallinis Salley</HI> by name, who conducted us from <HI>Joppa,</HI> through the Mountains up to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> was formerly a Rob∣ber himself, and could there∣fore the better carry us through the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who molest those Mountaines and live all upon Purchase; he was a <HI>Greek</HI> by Nation and Religion.</P>
<P>Now to our further Enter∣tainment at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> the next morning Father <HI>Tomaso,</HI> a Lay∣brother, one mighty serious, and Religious in their way, came to our Chamber with Milk, Wine and Fruit, (with a Blessing in his Mouth) the sea∣son being very hot: and a∣bout twelve of the Clock we went to Dinner, two or three
<PB N="21" REF="33"/>Lay Brothers attending at the Hall door, with a Bason and Ewer for us to wash; and then entring the Hall, the Fathers stood all on one side near one another, saying Grace in La∣tin, and then singing the Lords Prayer altogether; and after∣ward bowing toward the Picture of our Saviour at Supper with his Apostles, which is placed over the <HI>Guardians</HI> Head, ador∣ned with Silver Crosses about it, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Guardian</HI> hath his Table alone in the middle of the Room, and two long Tables stand of each side, one for the Pilgrims, and the other for the Fathers; after they had kiss'd the ground, we all sate down, and had eve∣ry
<PB N="22" REF="34"/>one his alotment brought in a little dish, of which we ne∣ver wanted three or four Cour∣ses of several sorts of Meat: our Wine, Water, and Fruit, was set ready for us; the Wine was about a Quart, the Water something less, which was the allowance of two men, and had two Glasses belonging to it: a∣bout the middle of Dinner, the <HI>Frater</HI> came, and changed our Water, that it might drink the fresher.</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, the Fa∣ther — <HI>Guardian</HI> knocks, and the <HI>Fraters</HI> rise and kneel with their Faces toward the Picture of our Saviour with his Disciples at Supper, and mumbling some∣thing to themselves, they kiss
<PB N="23" REF="34"/>the ground, and then begin to take away; one taking away the Dishes, another the Knives, every one having his appoint∣ment, and then give Thanks in the same manner as before Dinner; then washing at the door, they go into the Church to Prayer, for a quarter of an hour; this they do daily, rising always early, and in the Night also, to go to Mass.</P>
<P>At this time there were two or three Christians come from <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> whose art is to make the Figure of our Saviours Se∣pulcher, or what Holy Story you please, upon your Arm; they make it of a blew colour, and it is done by the continu∣all pricking of your Arm with
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>Needles; they began presently to go to work on some of us, and having presented us the Patterns of abundance of Prints, every one took his Fan∣cy.</P>
<P>The next day, <HI>May</HI> twenty seven, we all agreed to goe in∣to the Temple, and about four a Clock in the afternoon we went: There are about ten or twelve Fathers that live there continually, and have their Church there: The door is sea∣led with the <HI>Caddys</HI> Seal, and when any man goes in, he pays fourteen Livers; we being en∣tred the Temple, the Fathers came and Saluted us, and con∣ducted us to their Lodgings; where after we had been about
<PB N="25" REF="35"/>an hour, they prepared to go in Procession to all the holy places, presenting us every one a Book of Holy Songs, for every place in <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P>And so we set out, the Fa∣thers being dressed in white Surplices; and the <HI>Cheif</HI> a∣mong them with Cloth of Sil∣ver over his Surplice, with two more dressed in the like Garb to lead him: there was a great Silver Cross carried before him, with the Picture of our Savi∣our Crucified upon it, and two men going on each side of it, with Incense Pots, to persume every Holy Place, that we came to. And so we went to these places following:</P>
<P N="1">1 To the Pillar to which our
<PB N="26" REF="36"/>Saviour was bound when he was scourged.</P>
<P N="2">2 To the Prison, wherein our Saviour was put.</P>
<P N="2">3 To the place where the Soldi∣ers divided our Saviours Garments.</P>
<P N="4">4 The place where St. <HI>Hel∣lena</HI> found our Saviours Cross.</P>
<P N="5">5 The Pillar to which our Sa∣viour was bound when he was Crowned with Thorns.</P>
<P N="6">6 To <HI>Mount Galvary,</HI> where he was Crucified.</P>
<P N="7">7 The place where our Savi∣our was Nayled to the Cross.</P>
<P N="8">8 To the place where he was Anointed.</P>
<P N="9">9 To the Sepulcher of Christ.</P>
<P N="10">10 To the place where our Saviour appeared to <HI>Mary Mag∣dalen</HI> in the shape of a Gardiner.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="27" REF="36"/>
11 To the Chappel of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> where our Savi∣our first appeared to her after his Resurrection.</P>
<P>I might give you a particu∣ler description of the Adorn∣ment of these Places; but to be short, every one have Lamps burning at them; some are pa∣ved with Marble, others are hung with Pictures; the place where our Saviour was laid down to be nailed to the Cross, is paved with Marble; the place where he was Crucified, is pa∣ved with Marble also; but in the exact place where the Cross stood, the Marble is covered over with Silver, with Silver Lamps, and wax Candles con∣tinually burning; and our Sa∣viour
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>Crucified standing on it: the Sepulcher also is covered with Mar∣ble, with Silver Lamps continually burning on it; so hath the Anointing stone: you must go into the sepulcher barefoot, as also on <HI>Mount Calvary.</HI></P>
<P>Here are all sorts of Christians have their Churches: The <HI>Greeks</HI> have the best, the <HI>Latins,</HI> the the <HI>Armenians,</HI> the <HI>Copty's,</HI> and the <HI>Syrians,</HI> have each of them Churches here.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latines</HI> are the two powerful Religions in the Temple, and with great Sums of money, and the cre∣dit they have at <HI>Stambul</HI> or <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> they continually buy these Holy Places out of one anothers Hands; the other Parties are Poor, and are there∣fore squeez'd into a small part
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>of the Temple; The <HI>Latines</HI> that offered ten thousand Li∣vers, for a peice of the Cross, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> bought out of their hands.</P>
<P>These Religious People bear little respect one to another, speaking very basely each of other.</P>
<P>After our Procession, we went to veiw all the places and Chur∣ches again; the <HI>Greeks</HI> have a place in the middle of their Church, which they say, is the middle of the World: they have another place by the Pri∣son of Christ, with two holes to put the Feet in: there is al∣so a narrow Passage between two Pillars, which is in imita∣tion of the straightness of the Path to Heaven, which the
<PB N="30" REF="38"/><HI>Greeks</HI> Creep through.</P>
<P>In the Church of the <HI>Syri∣ans,</HI> is the intended Sepulcher of <HI>Joseph of Arimathea,</HI> and <HI>Ni∣codemus:</HI> and near the Anoin∣ting Stone, is a Tomb, where <HI>Godfrey,</HI> and <HI>Baldwin,</HI> Kings of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> are Buried. And in the same place is the Rent of the Rock, which begins above, near the place where our Savi∣our was Crucified; and in that Rent, they say <HI>Adams</HI> Head was found, when our Saviour gave up the Ghost. Thus ha∣ving seen the Temple, we re∣turn'd to the Convent.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the twenty eight, we went out of the City at <HI>Da∣mascus</HI> Gate, and turning on the right Hand, we came to one of the Fish-ponds, belonging to the
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>old City and a quarter of a Mile further, You come to the Grot where <HI>Jeremiah</HI> Lived, when he Wrote his Lamentations; on the left Hand in the en∣trance, is a Ledg in the Rock, about a Story High, where they say <HI>Jeremiah</HI> Slept; and below over against the Door, is a hole intended for his Sepulcher; and passing through a Ruinate Door, you come into the Yard, where his Well is, being a very good Spring of sweet Water; there you pay one Liver; afterwards passing along the side of a Mountain, that lies level with the City, a little beyond <HI>Je∣remiahs</HI> Tomb, we came to the Sepulcher of the Kings; the entrance into the first Room, was so small and low, that we
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>were forced to creep in, in which there were seven Sepul∣chers cut out of the Rock: in the second Room, there were eight Sepulchers more; and in the third Room twenty six more; and many more in several o∣ther Rooms: One of the Rooms hath a Dore of Stone, which is Cut out of the Rock, and shuts and opens as a Door with Hinges; this Door be∣longs to the Room, wherein <HI>Jehosaphat</HI> was Buried, his Cof∣fin is of Stone with a Cover to it, and is very neatly Wrote on the sides with Flowers, as se∣veral of them are also in the first Room, but they know not what Kings they are; there is al∣so one other Chamber into which we crept; so that there
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>are in all, forty two Burying-Places under ground, to which there is but one door to enter, all adorned with Admirable Workmanship; which I being unskilled in, am unfit to ex∣press in proper Terms: and so we return to the Convent, en∣tering the City at the same Gate.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the Twenty-ninth, we reposed, some of our Compa∣ny being a Marking.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> Thirty, we took Horse to go for <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and went out at the West-Gate called <HI>Joppa</HI>-Gate, and turning on the left hand, and taking the lower Path, we passed along the Road that the <HI>Virgin Ma∣ry</HI> brought our Saviour, when She came to offer him at the
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>Temple; and half a mile from the City is the place where the Tree <HI>Tirabintha</HI> grew, which the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> sat under to give him Suck; but the Tree being Cut down, the place is incompassed with a Wall.</P>
<P>On the left hand you see <HI>Davids</HI> House, where he was when he spied <HI>Bathsheba</HI> Wash∣ing her self; on the right Hand a little out of the Road, is old <HI>Simeons</HI> House and <HI>Elias</HI> House; and a quarter of a Mile fur∣ther you come to a Well, where the Wise Men first saw the Star; a little further is the ground where the Reapers were at work, when <HI>Habbakuk</HI> comming to bring them Meat, the Angel took him up by the hair of the Head, and carried
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>into <HI>Babylon</HI> to <HI>Daniel</HI> in the Lions Den: afterward we saw <HI>Jacobs</HI> House; and a hill like a Sugar Loaf: where the <HI>Franks</HI> remained forty Years, after they were driven out of <HI>Jeru∣salem;</HI> next is a Monastery of Monks of the order of St. <HI>Tavola Paula Romana,</HI> who when they dye, are Buryed at the Convent in <HI>Bethlehem.</HI></P>
<P>A Mile further is the place where the Angels appeared to the Shep∣pards, and sayd, <HI>Gloria in ex∣celsis,</HI> &amp;c. when our Saviour was Born, where there hath been a Convent; but now there only remaines an Arched Vault, where we paid Money to the <HI>Arabs;</HI> who when they espy a∣ny <HI>Franks</HI> going thither, Ride post before to take Possession
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>of the place, and get some∣thing from them; A quarter of a Mile from hence, in the way to <HI>Solomons</HI> Cisterns, is the Village of the Shep∣hards, on the backpart where∣of is a Well, of which they say, the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> defired to Drink; but the Inhabitants denying to draw her any Wa∣ter, it presently Overflowed for her to Drink: a little way from this Village, is <HI>Josephs</HI> House; and a little after, we came to <HI>Solomons</HI> Garden ly∣ing shelving: At the bottom of them is the Road from <HI>Gran Cairo,</HI> and round the Top passes the Aqueduct, which feeds <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with Water; (from thence we saw <HI>Tekoa</HI> standing on a high Hill) the wa∣ter
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>comes from the Fountains which feed <HI>Solomons</HI> Cisterns; passing a Mile along by the A∣queduct, we came to <HI>Solomons</HI> Cisterns, which are Three; the first had no Water in it, and might be about two hundred and fifty Yards long, and sixty Yards broad, and of a great depth; the second, it had lit∣tle Water, and was something less in Compass; the third was full of Water and as big as the first: they run one into another, and are fed by the spring that feeds the City.</P>
<P>The Fathers say, that they were made to Swim in, they being built with steps for a Man to goe down, but they seem rather to be intended for a reserve of Water for the City
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>or the Gardens, they having passage to both; neer the Gar∣dens, there is an ill-contrived Castle, where a few Villains inhabit, to whom we paid one Liver <HI>per</HI> Man for leave to goe into the Grot; where the Springs are that feed the City, and the Cisterns; the Grot is large, and hath three Springs in it, and a large passage cut through the Rock, toward the Cisterns, passable by a Man, but we went not to the end of it.</P>
<P>We mounted our Horses to pro∣ceed on our Journy, leaving the Castle on the Right Hand, and at a distance we saw St. <HI>Georges</HI> Church, where the Fathers say, the Chaines remain wherewith St. <HI>George</HI> was bound, which
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>will presently cure a Mad-man if he bound therewith.</P>
<P>After an hour and a halfes Riding, we came neer to <HI>Beth∣lehem,</HI> where passing through a narrow Lane, the Guard con∣sisting of four or five Musque∣tiers, received five Livers of e∣very one of us, and our Drug∣german that went with us, re∣ceived three: and arriving at the Convent, we payd one for our entrance; and after our being welcomed by the Fa∣thers, we took our repose till five of the Clock in the Evening; and then we prepared to goe in Procession to the Holy Pla∣ces in the same manner as we did at the Temple in <HI>Jerusa∣lem;</HI> the Places we Visited were these:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="40" REF="43"/>
1 The Place where our Sa∣viour was Born.</P>
<P N="2">2 The Tomb of St. <HI>Joseph</HI> to whom the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was espoused.</P>
<P N="2">3 St. <HI>Innocents</HI> Tomb.</P>
<P N="4">4 The place where St. <HI>Je∣rom</HI> lived, when he translated the Bible into <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5 St. <HI>Jeroms</HI> Praying place.</P>
<P N="6">6 St <HI>Jeroms</HI> Tomb.</P>
<P N="7">7 St <HI>Pauls</HI> Tomb.</P>
<P N="8">8 St. <HI>Eustachias</HI> her Dangh∣ter.</P>
<P N="9">9 The Sepulcher of St. <HI>Eu∣sebius,</HI> Abbot of <HI>Bethlehem.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10 We return to the Chap∣pel of St <HI>Catherena,</HI> which they say was built by St. <HI>Panla.</HI></P>
<P>Next is the great Church without the Convent, which hath forty eight Pillars of Mar∣ble
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>about three Yards long, all in one Peice.</P>
<P>At Evening we went to visit the place of our Saviours Birth, which formerly belonged to the <HI>Latins,</HI> till the <HI>Greeks</HI> bought it out of their Hands; so that now the <HI>Latins,</HI> when they goe their Procession, Pray at that Door by which they formerly en∣tred.</P>
<P>The <HI>Precipior</HI> hath two Doors, one exactly over against the o∣ther, which are well Lined with Carved Iron, and strengthed with Iron Spikes: We went in Bare-foot, on the Right hand in the entrance, is the place they say where our Saviour was Born, which is Lined with Marble; and in the midle of the Room there is a little place covered
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>with Silver, by which they set a Dish to receive your Charity: On the left Hand is the Manger where the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> laid our Saviour; which is Lined with Marble; and at the end of the Manger on the Right Hand, is the Picture of St. <HI>Jerom</HI> natu∣rally in the Marble, which the Fathers esteem as a Miracle.</P>
<P>Over against this Manger, is the place where the three Wise Men stood, when they came to Worship our Saviour: and at the further end of this place in a corner, is a hole made up up with Marble, wherein they say, the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> put the Water, when she had washed her hands: Over which a Lamp Burns continually: and there are also a great many Lamps
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>burning in the other Places. Over this <HI>Precipio,</HI> in the great Church, is the Altar of Circum∣cision, where our Saviour was Circumcised.</P>
<P>We having seen what was Rare at <HI>Bethlem, May</HI> thirty One, early in the Morning, we Rose to proceed in our Journey, in which we saw these Places following.</P>
<P N="1">1 The Grot where the Vir∣gin <HI>Mary</HI> hid her self, when she was Warned to Fly into <HI>E∣gypt,</HI> &amp; her Milk running out of her Brests there, made the Earth turn White; which Earth the Catholicks do very much e∣steem.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Davids</HI> Cisterns.</P>
<P N="2">3 The Grot wherein the Vir∣gin <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Joseph</HI> lived, be∣fore
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>they could get a House.</P>
<P N="4">4 The Tomb of <HI>Rachel, Ja∣cobs</HI> Wife, which the <HI>Turks</HI> do also much esteem.</P>
<P N="5">5 The Feild of <HI>Sennacharib,</HI> where the Angel of the Lord flew in one Night, One hundred eighty 5000. of the <HI>Syrians;</HI> in this place is a Village, which is called <HI>Botechelle,</HI> where the Fa∣thers affirm, no <HI>Turk</HI> can live.</P>
<P N="6">6 The place where the Pillars of the Convent of <HI>Ramath</HI> were built.</P>
<P N="7">7 The Vinyard from whence the Spyes of the Land of <HI>Ca∣naan</HI> took the Cluster of Grapes, to show the fruitfulness of the Land; there is also the Fountain, where <HI>Philip</HI> Baptized the Queen of <HI>Sheba's</HI> Eunuch.</P>
<P N="9">9 The Desarts of <HI>John Bap∣tist;</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="45"/>and after an hours Riding, we came to <HI>John Baptists</HI> Foun∣tain, where was his Chamber; and a Rock, wherein there was a place cut out like a bench for his Bed; to break off any bit of this Rock, is Worthy excommu∣nication.</P>
<P N="10">10 <HI>Zacharias</HI> House, where the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> came to salute her Couzen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> for the Angel that told her she should conceive, told her also, that her Couzen was with Child; and upon her Salu∣tation, the Child leaped in the Womb: Near this House is a Fountain with two Cisterns which is called <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Fountain.</P>
<P N="11">11 There is a Stone where <HI>John Baptist</HI> Preached, which the Fathers say, the <HI>Turks</HI> have en∣deavoured to break in peices but could not.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="46" REF="46"/>
12 The place where <HI>John Baptist</HI> was Born, now a Stable; but formerly a Church, where the Fathers upon <HI>John Baptists</HI> day carry their Organs thither, and Adorn the Place for their Prayers.</P>
<P N="13">13 The Tombs of the <HI>Mac∣cabees,</HI> which we saw at a di∣stance, and being ruinated, ap∣pear as so many Arches.</P>
<P N="14">14 We passed by a Village, where the Men are all <HI>Turks,</HI> and the Women <HI>Christians;</HI> for the People being poor, the <HI>Turks</HI> were very severe with them for their <HI>Harach;</HI> who not being able to pay all at once, turned <HI>Turks,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="15">15 We came to the Mountain <HI>Crupil,</HI> where part of the Wood whereof our Saviours Cross was
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>made, was cut down, and over the place where they say the Tree stood, from which it was cut, there is a stately Church, which is in the Possession of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> the just place where the Tree grew is inlayd with Silver, by which they set a Dish for your Charity: the Flore of this Church is well Wrought with <HI>Mosaick</HI> Work, and painted with Scripture Stories; and in∣stead of a Bell, they knock up∣on a board, that hangs up, which sounds somewhat like a Bell.</P>
<P>And now we goe forward to the Convent at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> passing by Mount <HI>Grhon,</HI> where <HI>Solomon</HI> was Anointed King; and about night we came to our Lodgings, having made two
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>days journey to see the Holy Places, and Traverse the Moun∣tains of <HI>Judea;</HI> we slept very well that night, but still we have more Pilgrimages.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 1. We lay still to recover our selves of our <HI>Bethlem</HI> Jour∣ney, but Father <HI>Tomasa</HI> out of his Zeal, is very importunate with us to be walking to see o∣ther places, which is very Me∣ritorious in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church; and had we been of their Reli∣gion, it had been impossible to have mist Heaven; for we had received indulgences for all our Lives; which fancy I wish doth not deceive too many.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the second, We began to search for the Holy places, which are these following.</P>
<P N="1">1 The Immolation of <HI>Isaac</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>neer the Temple, called Mount <HI>Morea,</HI> which place is inlay'd with Silver, and a dish set by for your Offering.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Peters</HI> Prison, still made a Prison by the <HI>Turks:</HI> at the further end of which, is a hole in the Wall, where they say the Chain was fastened, with which St. <HI>Peter</HI> was Chai∣ned; litle remembring, how often <HI>Jerusalem</HI> hath been destroyed, and the Stones of that Old Wall, are now probably as far under Ground, as these are a∣bove.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Monastery of the Knights of <HI>Malta;</HI> a very fair building, one Room where∣of hath several Partitions for Beds, with a hole in the mid∣dle, that if any of them are
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>Sick or Fluxitive, they are layd there; to which the Water, (being Bad) and the Air un∣wholesome, doth very much in∣cline them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple; which, if any <HI>Christian</HI> goe in∣to, or but up the stairs, he must Turn <HI>Turk,</HI> or be burnt: The Rarity of which I shall give you an Account of, when I come to a Prospect.</P>
<P>Fifthly, St. <HI>Hellena's</HI> Hospi∣tal, where there are seven great Caldrons, in which she used to have Provisions dressed for the Poor, where we pay one Li∣ver for entrance.</P>
<P>Sixthly, the <HI>Judgement</HI> Gate, at which our Saviour was brought in: and some distance from the Gate, is the place
<PB N="51" REF="48"/>where he was Condemned.</P>
<P>Seventhly, The <HI>Dolorous Way,</HI> which is the way that Christ went, when he went to be Crucified; and in the way is the House of St. <HI>Veronica,</HI> who gave our Saviour a Napkin to wipe his Face, as he passed by: there is also <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s House, and the House of the <HI>Rich Glutton;</HI> and the place where our Saviour Fainted as they say, and <HI>Simon</HI> took up the Cross; and neer that, is the Church, where the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> stood to see him pass by, and Swounding with Grief; now called the Virgin <HI>Maries</HI> Church.</P>
<P>Eightly, <HI>Herods</HI> Palace, now ruinated, and is now the <HI>Bas∣sha's Seraglio;</HI> in one Room
<PB N="52" REF="49"/>is the place where they Clothed our Saviour with Purple.</P>
<P>Ninethly, <HI>Pilates</HI> House, where they shew the place, where our Saviour was Crowned with Thorns, and the Pillar to which he was bound, which was brought from thence, and put into the Temple: next, we enter the Hall, where <HI>Pi∣late</HI> Washed his Hands, &amp; declared himself Innocent of our Saviours Blood: out of which place we had a fair Prospect of <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple; which is built within the middle of a spacious Yard very well Paved; there are several Arches, good Walks, and Buildings about it: the Temple is Wrought with <HI>Mosaick</HI> Work, and by the <HI>Turks</HI> re∣port, is very Rich within, it being one of their <HI>Mosques;</HI> and though they have a half
<PB N="53" REF="49"/>Moon upon all their Temples or <HI>Mosques,</HI> yet this only hath a Cross through the middle: The Fathers reporting it would not stand till the Cross was made.</P>
<P>Tenthly, The place where Christ was Scourged, which is now a Shop for Linnen Cloth; but the Pillar to which our Saviour was bound, is brought from thence, and put into the Temple.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, The House of <HI>Annas,</HI> where our Saviour be∣ing carried along with great Violence down a steep place, to prevent falling, he layd hold of the corner of a Wall, where there is a place, in one of the Stones, fit for a Mans Hand, which the Fathers ac∣count
<PB N="54" REF="50"/>a great Miracle.</P>
<P>Twelfthly, <HI>Simon</HI> the Phari∣sees House, where there is a Stone, with the print of a Foot, which they say our Sa∣viour made, when he stood to pardon <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> her Sins: The Fathers say, the <HI>Turks</HI> have endeavoured several times to remove this Stone, but still it comes into the same place again.</P>
<P>Thirteenth, The House of <HI>Joakim,</HI> and <HI>Anna:</HI> a fair high Building; and down in an un∣der Room, cut out of the Rock, is the place where they say, The Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was Born.</P>
<P>Fourteenth, The Pool of <HI>Be∣thesda,</HI> where the Sick lay to be healed; the Angel com∣ming
<PB N="55" REF="50"/>Yearly to Trouble the Water, and he that entred in first, was healed; but it is now dry, and half filled with Earth.</P>
<P>Fifteenth, St. <HI>Stephens</HI> Gate, and a little out of the City, is the place where <HI>Stephen</HI> was Stoned: and the Fathers would have you to fancy, that there is the print of his Hands, Face, and Knees, when he fell down.</P>
<P>Sixteenth, The Vally of <HI>Je∣hosophat,</HI> which is at the bot∣tom of the Hill, between the the Mountain on which <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI> stands, and <HI>Mount Oli∣vet.</HI></P>
<P>Seventeenth, The Place where the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> is Bu∣ried; where going down a great many stone steps, you come
<PB N="56" REF="51"/>into a large Vault, where all the <HI>Christians</HI> have their Altars a∣part, all being of several Opi∣nions, and the <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> do both burn Lamps, over her Grave; here we pay One Liver for entrance; and Forty eight Stone Steps up∣ward, is <HI>Josephs</HI> Tomb; and over against that, are the Tombs of <HI>Joakim</HI> and <HI>An∣na.</HI></P>
<P>Eighteenth, The place where Christ sweat Bloud, and the Angel appeared to Comfort him, is neer the bottom of <HI>Mount Olivet.</HI></P>
<P>Nineteenth, The Place where our Saviour Prayed, that <HI>This Cup might pass from him;</HI> and neer that place, is the Rock on which his Disciples sate,
<PB N="57" REF="51"/>when he went to Prayer, be∣tween which two places he was taken, it is now bordering on the Garden of <HI>Gethsemena,</HI> but might formerly have been part of the Garden, and is on the Ascent of the <HI>Mount of Olivet;</HI> where the Multitude going to Carry our Saviour away, <HI>Peter</HI> smote off <HI>Malcus</HI> his Ear, in in the way to the City.</P>
<P>Twentyeth, The Place where they say the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> Pray∣ed for St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> while he was Stoning.</P>
<P>Twenty first, The place where Christ Wept over <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> it is almost at the Top of <HI>Mount Olivet.</HI></P>
<P>Twenty second, The Place our Saviour Ascended into Hea∣ven, having as they say, left
<PB N="58" REF="52"/>the Print of his Foot on a Stone: it hath now a Chap∣pel built over it, with four∣teen Marble Pillars round it, it is at the top of Mount <HI>Olivet;</HI> and a little way off, is the Place where the Men of <HI>Gallilee</HI> stood, when the Angel asked them, <HI>Why stand ye Gazing up?</HI></P>
<P>Twenty third, The Place is shewed us, where the Angel told the Virgin, she should be Raysed in three Days.</P>
<P>Twenty fourth, <HI>Pelagius</HI> his Grot; from whence we saw <HI>Bethpage,</HI> where the Asses Colt was tied.</P>
<P>Twenty fifth, The Tree un∣der which our Saviour stood, when he Preached the Judg∣ment Sermon.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="52"/>
Twenty sixth, The place where he made the Lords Prayer.</P>
<P>Twenty seventh, The Place where the Apostles made the Creed; being a Grot of twelve Arches.</P>
<P>Twenty Eight, The Sepul∣chers of the Prophets, being Forty seven in Number, cut out of the Rock; and entring in at a Door, we came into a large Grot, where there were several places to cut out, fit to contain a Coffin: here we paid one Liver.</P>
<P>Twenty Nineth, The Tree where <HI>Judas</HI> Hanged him∣self.</P>
<P>The Thirtyeth, The Sepul∣cher which <HI>Jehosophat</HI> intended for himself; but being a King, he was buried in the Sepulcher, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Kings.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="53"/>
Thirty One, <HI>Absoloms</HI> Pillar or Sepulcher, which is cut out of the Rock, and about the big∣ness of a small Chamber, with Pillars cut out round about; so that it stands like a Room built for some single Person: it is of a good Height, and hath some Carving about it.</P>
<P>Thirty Two, They say hereby is the Print of Christs Feet; for when he was Car∣ried to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he stopped at the Brook <HI>Cedron,</HI> and desired to Drink: This Brook is now but a small Channel, and had no Water in it, when we were there; but in the Winter time, the Water comes down from the Hills, and makes a small Current.</P>
<P>Thirty Three, Next is the
<PB N="61" REF="53"/>Place where Saint <HI>James</HI> hid himself three Days, and three Nights; it is a place cut out of the Rock, which must needs have been made for a dwelling place; neer this is the Sepulcher of <HI>Zacharias</HI> the Son of <HI>Barachias,</HI> cut out of the Rock.</P>
<P>Thirty four, On the side of the Hill, on which <HI>Solomon</HI> Worshipped <HI>Molock,</HI> are Cham∣bers cut out of the Rock, which they say was the place, where∣in the Three Hundred Wives, and One Thousand Concu∣bines of <HI>Solomon</HI> were kept.</P>
<P>Thirty Five, The Fountain of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which you goe down to by Stone Steps; the Water whereof is so Sweet, that were a Man blindfolded,
<PB N="62" REF="54"/>he could not think it to be a∣ny thing but Milk and Wa∣ter.</P>
<P>Thirty Six, The Place where the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> was Sawn Asunder: his Sepulcher is un∣der a Rock neer the same Place.</P>
<P>Thirty Seven, The Fountain of <HI>Siloa,</HI> by which is a Cistern, wherein formerly the Pilgrims used to Wash, but it is now Ruined, and filled with Stones and Mud, yet it is Water still accounted good for the Eye-Sight; and near this is <HI>Golgo∣tha.</HI></P>
<P>Thirty Eight, And near this Place, in a bottom, is a Well, wherein they say <HI>Nehemiah</HI> hid the Holy Fire, when the Chil∣dren of <HI>Jsrael</HI> were carried
<PB N="63" REF="54"/>Captive; and when they re∣turned Forty Years after, they say they found the same Fire in the Well.</P>
<P>Thirty Nine, Ascending up the Mount, we came to the Tombs of <HI>Annas</HI> and <HI>Cai∣phas.</HI></P>
<P>Forty, And near it is the Place where the Apostles hid themselves; where entring a streight passage, we came into a Room under Ground, out of which there goe several holes, wherein they say, the <HI>Apostles</HI> Lay.</P>
<P>Forty One, We then came to <HI>Aceldama,</HI> a Grot, which is now held by the <HI>Armenians</HI> for a Burying Place: it is said, the Earth thereof, will consume the Body of a Man, in Forty
<PB N="64" REF="55"/>Eight Hours: there are seve∣ral Vents on the Top to let out the smell: We went down under a Rock, to a place where we could look into it, and we there saw the form of a Man entire, they being only layd in, but not Covered with Earth.</P>
<P>Forty Second, We came to the Fountain of <HI>Bersheba,</HI> which is at the bottom of Mount <HI>Sion,</HI> in which there is now but little Water, we being forced to tarry a quarter of an hour for one Draught.</P>
<P>Having now seen all that was Remarkable in these Parts, we made toward the Convent, having got a great deal of Cre∣dit with Father <HI>Tomasa;</HI> that we should be such Zealous Pil∣grims,
<PB N="65" REF="55"/>as to walk from five a Clock in the Morning till Mid∣day; but he to encourage us, would still be formost; and told us always, there was some place more worth our seeing, then any we had seen before: and though he was an old man, and the Weather hot, yet at the going up of a Hill, he would run, that he might be foremost: and gave us all the good Words that could be, to encourage us Protestants, who never hoped or thought, that we Merited any thing by it: but at length we came to the Convent again, and being well weary, every one retired to his Lodings.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> Third, we repose at the Convent; after Dinner, one
<PB N="66" REF="56"/>the Fathers came and told us, that the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> would wash our Feet; which Honour we accounted too great for us, and desired to be excused▪ but we were forced to comply with the Orders of the Convent; The Bason, which was as big as a Tub, was placed by a Chair; there were Rose-Leaves and Herbs put into the Wa∣ter; the Fathers all stood in a Row, Singing Godly Hymns; we sat down, and the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> wrapt a Towel about our Knees, to keep our Cloths from Water; then they began to scrub our Leggs and Feet, (being Masters of their Art) there were two <HI>Fratres</HI> atten∣ding, one on one Leg, and ano∣ther on the other; having first
<PB N="67" REF="56"/>dryed the left Foot, the <HI>Frater</HI> kisses it, and puts on our Slip∣per; then he dryes the Right Foot, and wraps the Towel a∣bout the Sole of the Foot, and setting it on his Knee, and co∣vers the Toes with his Hand, and then come all the <HI>Fratres,</HI> and Kisses it; this being done, he gives us a little Candle, in taking of which, we kiss his Hand, and so rise and stand by, till all our Company are Washed in like manner. Then went we in Procession, round their Chappel, they saying se∣veral Prayers, at their three Altars, and so we return to our Chambers.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the Fourth, Af∣ter Dinner, we went into the Kitchen, where we found
<PB N="68" REF="57"/>all the Fathers, with Napkins before them, washing the Dish∣es, every one taking his part, even to the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> himself; some were cleaning some handing away; but all the while, with one Consent, they say some Prayer; it seeming to be their endeavour, that all that they do, may be done to the Glory of God; this being done, they goe all to the Chap∣pel to Prayers, and you shall never see the Chappel, with∣out some of them at Prayers; yea, and two or three times in the Night they Rise to Pray∣ers.</P>
<P>On Whitsunday, the Chap∣pel was Adorned something Extraordinarily, and there was a very Rich Canopy, set on
<PB N="69" REF="57"/>the Right Hand of the high Altar, for the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> to sit under; when the Pray∣ers began, the Father <HI>Guardi∣an</HI> came into the Chappel, and sate under this Canopy: There were three or foure Fathers Drest in Cloth of Silver, much after the manner of a He∣rald; two whereof attend on each side of the <HI>Guardian,</HI> and two stand over against him.</P>
<P>Then they began to dress the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> in his Festi∣val Robes, and having read two or three Lines, they put a peice of Linnen laced about this Neck, and then his Surplice, Reading still between every Robe that was put on. Then they cover him with a Garment of Rich Sattin, and Cloth of Silver; the two
<PB N="70" REF="58"/>that stand over against him, bowing at some words. His body being thus drest, the two Fathers, put a Myter upon his head, doing it with all the Re∣spect Imaginable; after a short Prayer, they take the Father-<HI>Guardian</HI> by the hand, and lead him to the Altar, he stand∣ing in the middle of the four Fathers, adorned as aforesaid; the other Fathers have their Surplices on, and the Organs go; then making a short Pra∣yer at the Altar, they lead the <HI>Gardian</HI> to his place again; and after a little reading, they take off his Myter, and he sits bare till the Prayer be done: then they put on another Myter; the first was of Cloth of Silver, and the second was of Cloth of
<PB N="71" REF="58"/>Gold, set full of Rubies, and Diamonds, and other sorts of Stones; they afterward took off that also, and put on a third Myter, which was of Cloth of Gold, something differing in shape, from the others.</P>
<P>The Guardian being led, to and from the Altar, a great while, at length, when they came to read that place, where the Holy Ghost came down upon the Apostles, assembled together, there was a Father upon the Terrass, appointed to throw down a white Pidgeon drest up with Ribbons, in imitation of the Holy Ghost, but he met with some difficulty; for the window was so fast shut that he could not open it a great while, so that we had like to
<PB N="72" REF="59"/>have gone away without their Holy Ghost: but this difficulty being overcome, he made the Dove descend among us; which being done, after a Prayer, they began to undress the Fa∣ther <HI>Guardian</HI> again, reading all the while his Robes were taking off; and so that days service was done.</P>
<P>Now we began to think of going to the Dead Seas, and the River Jordan, we therefore de∣manded what our expence would be, the Fathers say, twen∣ty five Livers, but we all agreed not to give above twenty; The Fathers sent our resolution to the <HI>Bassa,</HI> and he return'd us this answer, That if we would goe, we should pay twenty two Livers; and if we would not,
<PB N="73" REF="59"/>he would have ten Livers a man; we thinking our selves under his command, and not willing to embroyl the Convent, for they are to bare all damages, as they have done for several; but thanks be to God, none hapned in our time.</P>
<P>We all resolved to goe, except Mr. <HI>T. H.</HI> and one Englishman more, and a Dutchman, not thinking the <HI>Bashaw</HI> had been in earnest; but because they went not, they were forced to pay ten Livers for nothing; we then came to <HI>Bethany,</HI> now a small Village, where entring into a Grot under ground, we saw a Tomb, from whence they say our Saviour raysed <HI>Laza∣rus,</HI> after he had been dead so many dayes; here we had the
<PB N="74" REF="60"/><HI>Bashaws</HI> guard to wait upon us, for fear of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who are on the other side <HI>Jordan</HI> in the land of <HI>Moab;</HI> who doe often make incursions, and have sharp disputes, at the end of the Lance, with those that live on this side, in the land of Pro∣mise; The <HI>Bashaw</HI> pretended, that he must send fifty men with us, but it proved but fourteen or sixteen,</P>
<P>Having reposed a little on the ground, about nine of the clock at night, we mounted our Horses, and passing through the turning and winding of the Mountains, we came in the Morning to the foot of the <HI>Qua∣rantine</HI> Mountain, where we dismounted; and making the cold earth our bed, we slept
<PB N="75" REF="60"/>two or three hours, having our horses made fast to our hands, and the Sun rising, we rose also, and walked to <HI>Elisha's</HI> Fountain, a stones throw off; and before the Sun was too hot, we Mounted our Horses at the foot of the Mountain, and so began to ascend, it being very steep; having ascended a great height, we came to the place where they say, our Saviour slept, when he Fasted Forty days; and from that the Moun∣tain received its name; this place is neer the height of the Mountaine, but the passage to the top, is Known only to the <HI>Arabs;</HI> here is a Church over this place, where some <HI>Fathers</HI> have lived, till they were Mur∣dered by the <HI>Arabs.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="61"/>
Below this place are several Cisterns of water, and several Frontispeices of Chappels, but the passage to them is cut off; as we were going up, the thoughts of the danger of de∣scending, enters into our heads, and the Emperour of <HI>Germanies</HI> Druggerman for these Coun∣trey Languages, being extra∣ordinary fearful, got two <HI>Turks</HI> to conduct him down, and so we having all had a safe descent, we rode cheerfully back to <HI>Elisha's</HI> Fountain, which was formerly bitter; but he throwing in a handful of salt, the waters be∣came sweet.</P>
<P>Here we lay till Four a clock, and the heat of the Sun being over, we made for <HI>Jericho,</HI> where we arrived about five,
<PB N="77" REF="61"/>where there are now, only a few poor Cottages: we pitched by <HI>Zacheus</HI> Tree, the Inhabi∣tants are for the most part <HI>Ara∣bians,</HI> and some few <HI>Greeks:</HI> here the Captain of the Village came to welcome our <HI>Bashaw</HI> and his people; he was moun∣ted upon a Mare, valued at a Thousand Livers, Mares be∣ing only in esteem among them; here we reposed under a rotten hedg, till about four of the Clock next mourning; ha∣ing little pleasure in our com∣panions, the Gnats, and other stinging creatures.</P>
<P>We proceed for the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> where we arrived by day-light, and tarried about an hour to swim in the River; the stream is strong, and rapid;
<PB N="78" REF="62"/>and the force of a man, can little more then resist it; it runs in∣to the Dead Sea.</P>
<P>Our Guard were very hasty for us to be gone, being afraid their Enemies should find them; therefore we all made ready, and set forward for the Dead Sea; about two hours after in our way to the Sea, we passed through a most cursed barren place, not having so much as a green herb or grass, and the face of the earth was covered with Salt, and though it was dry, yet our Horses sunk up to the Knees.</P>
<P>We come now to the Dead Sea, being about Seventy or Eighty Miles in Breadth, and about Eighteen Over: There is no place Visible from whence
<PB N="79" REF="62"/>the Water, which comes in∣to it, runs out again, except it be under the earth; neither doth it seem to Increase with the water of the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> and of sevaral other waters that run into it: It was once a fruit∣full Valley, and compared for delight, unto Paradise, and was called <HI>Pentapolis,</HI> of her five Cities, and was afterward de∣stroyed with fire from Heaven, and turned into this silthy Lake, and barren desolation which doth encompass it: &amp; to try the virtue, that is reported to be in the water, wherein they say, a man cannot sink; some of our Company went into the Sea, and found it impossible to get their bodies under water, yea could hardly keep their legs
<PB N="80" REF="63"/>under; The water is sulphury, and the extremity of the salt∣ness is not to be exprest; when they came out of the water, there was a perfect Oyl upon their bodies.</P>
<P>Our Eyes being satisfied with Curiosities, and Rarities, we make what hast we can, back to <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> but I should have given you an Account, that the Ruins of one of the Cities, that were destoryed for Sodomy, now lyes good part out of the water, and is supposed to be <HI>Zeboim.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Sun gets strenght, and grows extraordinary hot, and by reflection on the ground, makes the heat so violent, that our faces looked as if the skin were flead off, by riding
<PB N="81" REF="63"/>in the Sun, from Morning till four of the Clock in the after∣noon; but the Fathers being accustomed, to meet with ten∣der-faced Travellers, soon pro∣vided something to mitigate our pain, which was much in∣creased, by reason of the salt∣ness of the water of the <HI>Dead Sea:</HI> this night we took little pleasure in eating, but more in sleeping, having had but little in this Voyage.</P>
<P>Having now visited all the places in the Holy Land, which Pilgrims usually do, we pre∣pare our selves for our return. <HI>June</HI> Ninth, we being resol∣ved to set forward in our Return; In the Morning the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> came to us, and gave us his blessing, and
<PB N="82" REF="64"/>sprinkled us with Holy Water, desiring us to excuse our Bad Treatment, and that if at any time we had been dis∣tasted, we would pass it over; but we Knew it was but a com∣plement, for we had the Civilest Entertainment imaginable, and very far from disgusting us; for there were none of them, but were not only ready to be our servants, but our Slaves, yea, my honest name-sake, Fa∣ther <HI>Tomaso,</HI> never ceased from Morning to Night, from bringing us either Victuals or Drink, or asking us whether we wanted any thing; and now for this his fourteen days ser∣vice, we were no ways capa∣ble to recompence him; for they would take no money,
<PB N="83" REF="64"/>but for our Victuals, and for some other small services; we therefore presented to the Con∣vent, thirty Livers apeice, and some that had servants present∣ed more. The Father <HI>Procurator</HI> receiving it, they entred all our names in a Book, and the sums we gave; the Book where the names only were written, we had a view of, and took a Coppy, of all the <HI>Englishmens</HI> names that were in it, from the year One Thousand Five Hundred Sixty One, to this day, being One Hundred Fifty Eight in number.</P>
<P>Now taking our leaves of the Fathers, they all shewed a great deal of affection to us, weeping, and expressing their desires, to enjoy our company
<PB N="84" REF="65"/>longer; and our desires were as much to be nearer home, that we might have an Account of our Freinds.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the Fourth we departed, our <HI>Muletters</HI> having provided us Horses; and our intentions were to take <HI>Emaus</HI> in our way, but night drawing on, we made St. <HI>Jeroms</HI> Church our sleep∣ing place; there were formerly Fathers lived in it, but the <HI>Arabs</HI> came upon them in the night, and cut all their throats; The Church is very well built, and hath been adorned with Pictures upon the wall, of which some remain to this day.</P>
<P>About too hours riding from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> we passed over the brook, out of which they say,
<PB N="85" REF="65"/><HI>David</HI> gathered the pebble stones, wherewith he slew <HI>Go∣liah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>June</HI> Fifth, we arrived at the Convent in <HI>Ramath,</HI> about ten of the Clock in the Morning; where we tarried till about mid∣night, at which time there was a Ship to depart, and some of us intended to embarque; the rest of us took a little boat, about the bigness of a <HI>Gravesend</HI> Barge; we put our provisions of Bread and Wine aboard, and so we put to Sea, keep∣ing always neer the shore, for fear of a storm.</P>
<P>After three days sayl, we ar∣rived at <HI>Aerica,</HI> formerly called <HI>Ptolemais,</HI> we always coming to Anchor at night; this place is famous for nothing but the ruins,
<PB N="86" REF="66"/>the Road being so bad, that all the Art Captains have, can but keep their Cables toge∣ther.</P>
<P>The Commodities in this place, are only <HI>Cottons, Pot-ashes,</HI> and fome <HI>Filletto's.</HI></P>
<P>Two days after we arrived at <HI>Tripoly,</HI> where we made bold, at our old House; the Consul receives us very gladly, and our design was, to depart next day, but the Plague still raging at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the Consul forced us to stay with him Twelve or Fourteen days; all which time we were treated like Princes, and then by his leave, we imbarqued on a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship for <HI>Scanderoon;</HI> the rest of our Company (whom we left at <HI>Aerica</HI> to goe to see the
<PB N="87" REF="66"/>of <HI>Gallilee</HI>) being arrived.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> Twenty Six, we arrived at <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> where some were dead, and others dying, and one flying from another.</P>
<P>We tarried upon the Mount, and aboard the Ship for some time: and <HI>July</HI> 2d we arrived at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where there dyed at that time, Seventy or Eighty of a day of the Plague.</P>
<P>And thus ended our Jour∣ney.</P>
