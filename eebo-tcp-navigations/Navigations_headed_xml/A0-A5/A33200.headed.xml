<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Sudden and Ʋnexpected Breach which hath happened here, between the King of <HI>Bantam</HI> and His Eldest Son; together with the considerable Dammage which the <HI>English Merchants</HI> have sustained thereby, in the Loss of their Factory, and a good part of their Trade, hath been Matter of much Wonder and Amazement to us
<PB N="2" REF="3" MS="y"/>here; and (I suppose) no less, but rather much more to you in <HI>England:</HI> which doth (I imagine) render you desirous to learn the Occasion and Manner of it; which I herewith send you, hoping it will give you full Satisfaction; for although to be present at, and be a Sufferer in the Extremities of War, and the Com∣mon Calamities which always attend the Besieging and Storming of Cities, yet the hearing thereof at a di∣stance, or the reading the written Relations of it, usu∣ally afford abundance of Pleasure and Delight especi∣ally when there is any thing extraordinary in the Occa∣sion, or in the Manner of Prosecuting and Managing the War: somewhat of both which you will find in the following Relation.</P>

<P>THE 11th. Instant, this Ship was in readi∣ness To Sail, but was retarded by the King of <HI>Bantam</HI>'s Letter to His Majesty of <HI>England,</HI> it not being ready till the 13<SUP>th.</SUP> when at Midnight he sent it on Board. The next Morning, by Break of Day, the <HI>Dutch</HI> with Sloops and small Boats attempted to Land their Men at the Rivers Mouth (which is about a Musket-Shot distant from our Factory) so that we could not send off our Dispatch.</P>
<P>They lay there all that day, and the <HI>Javas</HI> Ar∣my close by them, who had positive Orders from the King of <HI>Bantam,</HI> not to begin first.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> durst not venture farther, see∣ing a great Number of Men ready to oppose them,
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>with far greater Courage than they (or indeed we our selves) did expect; towards Break of Day yesterday, the Water flowing, and their Vessels off the Ground, they all repaired thereto, and stood a little distance from the Rivers Mouth; when a∣bout Nine of the Clock in the Morning, they be∣gan the War with their great Guns from their great Ships and Hulks that were moored with their Broad-Sides to the Shoar, for the said purpose; and con∣tinued Firing as fast as ever they could till after Sun∣set:</P>
<P>The <HI>Javas</HI> manfully kept the Shoar the whole day without much loss of Men, and fired several great Guns from the Walls, some of which did exe∣cution on their Ships; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> this Morning have drawn all their small Vessels from the Shoar, We are in hopes all their future Attempts will be in vain; the <HI>Javas</HI> manifesting a resolute Intention of defying them, rather than come under their Yoke, and are not a little animated with Courage, to see the <HI>Dutch</HI> retreat.</P>
<P>Our Factory standing in harms way, we receiv∣ed great Shot in abundance; my own, and several others Chambers, each receiving one: But God be thanked, not a Soul in them hurt: We believe the <HI>Dutch</HI> sent many of them, knowing our Nation to have supplied this King with most of his Am∣munition, and to animate to our power the <HI>Javas</HI> against them: whereby we may partly guess the Kindness they will shew us if they come on Shoar. Their Fleet remains still in Harbor, and whether they will attempt further, none knows; we are bound to see the Event; and I hope, happen the
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>worst, we shall save our Lives. <HI>Sir,</HI> I thought it expedient to give you this Account, though the Bearer can satisfie you more largely; yet for what passed on Shoar, he has it himself by hear-say.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Batavia,</HI> <DATE>September 17. 1682.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I wrote you two Letters by the <HI>Scipio African;</HI> and in that of the later Date, advised more par∣ticularly the Condition we were then in; which I shall not repeat, but continue the Doleful Subject to the present time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> the Morning before her Departure, being opposed Landing, rested quiet in their Ships till the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March;</HI> when, before Day, with a fresh Supply of Forces, they Landed half a Mile distant from our Factory, soon Routed all the <HI>Ja∣vas,</HI> and received a welcom Admission into the Fort of the Young King (then drove to so great a streight by the Siege of his Fathers Army, that he could not have held out many days longer, and that with the loss of not above forty or fifty Men) they im∣mediately hoysed their Standard, and what remain'd undestroyed by the Old King's Forces, they that day mostly burnt, and Marched in Triumph through every part of the Town: We kept our Factory Gates shut, and were by them unmolested; as like∣wise the <HI>French, Danes</HI> and <HI>Chineses:</HI> But the same
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>Evening, about Five of the Clock, after we had so∣laced our selves with hopes of Security, a Report was spread abroad that the Young King design'd to cut us all off that very Night, being incensed at the conceived Assistance of Men and Ammunition afforded his Father by us during his being besieged; and thereupon, most of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who had for the security of their estates, brought great part thereof into our Factory, like so many Bees flocked about us, to take the same out.</P>
<P>It was Night, and we had only on small Ships Boat on shoar, so we were necessitated to stand the event; and sent her to give notice thereof to our Ships, with Orders to loose their Sails, get their Anchors apeak, and be gone, and if we were as∣saulted, to give Tidings what became of us; not a man of us departing the Shoar that belonged to the Factory; then we put our selves in a posture of de∣fence, hoping, without the Assistance of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to make our part good against all the People the Young King had; dividing our selves into two Watches, my Lot being in the first.</P>
<P>After Midnight, I went to Rest with somewhat better Hopes than those that had the first Sleep; as conceiving, if they had any real Design upon us, we should have heard of it before that time.</P>
<P>Repose made the remaining hours short; and the first Salute to my waking eyes, was the Glad∣som Day; when by a Sign (as appointed) with our Flag, the Ships Boats came on shoar; and soon af∣ter the <HI>Dutch</HI> Chief from the <HI>Fort,</HI> with a File of Souldiers, and several Carpenters came to their <HI>Factory,</HI> into the Yard whereof we had two
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>Galleries and several Windows, acquainting us in the most imperious manner he could express himself, That it was the King's Order to cut down the one, and stop up the other; which if we did not imme∣diately do, his People should: An Action of no∣thing but Insultation and Spite, design'd to increase our Fears and Amazement; their Factory being at that time uninhabited, and indeed almost ruined; yet we were forced to comply: The said Chief having lived many years in <HI>Bantam,</HI> and been our intimate Companion, induced us to believe his Morosity might be the effect of his Superiors Or∣ders, and that from him we might possibly under∣stand the Reality of the reported Massacre the night before, and whether still design'd; therefore was my self sent down to him, who told me it was really in∣tended, and a going to have been put in execution by the young King, but by their Major he was hin∣dred, and diswaded therefrom; which, though we believe a Truth, yet next to the Divine Mercy, we can impute it only to the (by them feared) ill Consequences, who by reason of the small number of the King's People, could not have acquitted themselves of being accessary thereto, if not by their Assistance, at least by their Permission, in∣asmuch as it was they that incens'd him against us, by their aggravating all our Actions what possibly they could to our Disadvantage.</P>
<P>Upon this we resolved, and accordingly went to the King, to congratulate his safe Delivery out of his late Troubles, that if he had any thing to say to us, we might clear our selves: Before whom,
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>when come, we found no such angry Aspect up∣on his brow, as by what was reported to us, we had reason to expect; he reproached us with our assist∣ing his Father, contrary to our <HI>Engagement</HI> of stand∣ing Neuter; and what most <HI>aggravated,</HI> was, that three of our Company came the day before the <HI>Landing</HI> of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to the Camp, close under his Wall, to instruct his Fathers Souldiers how to plant their Great Guns against him; I was my felf one in person, with Mr. <HI>George Chowne,</HI> then of Council, and Mr. <HI>Rich. Burnby,</HI> formerly Chief of <HI>Siam,</HI> who went, (as we acquainted him) only out of curiosity to see the place, upon an Invitation of the Captain that lay there; and as a proof of our Innocency and unthought of giving occasion of Displeasure or Di∣strust of his Majesty, we came within Call of his Soldiers on the Wall, without any other defence, save our confidence that we not medling or making on ei∣ther side, they would not hurt us (but it shall be a warning to me for ever exposing my self to so great a danger upon any such like Considerations so long as I live) and that what Supplies we otherwise af∣forded his Father, we were necessitated to, as being wholly under his Power, and himself then inclosed in his Fort, and unable to protect us. He interpreted all as excuses, acquainting us that tho' it was in his power to cut us off, yet out of that respect he had to our King and Company, would desist therefrom; a Lesson learnt him by the <HI>Dutch.</HI> Being dismist, we were the 31<SUP>st</SUP> con∣stantly affrighted with his Men in Arms, coming to our <HI>Factory,</HI> under the conduct of one or other of his three great Ministers of State he had left him, or a <HI>Dutch</HI> Re∣negado, by him highly advanced, whom we knew not
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>how to trust, neither durst deny Admittance; when in the evening, the Chief of the said Ministers, he that has been above two years underhand with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> contriving to bring the Design about of get∣ting <HI>Bantam,</HI> came to us with a Paper written in the <HI>Mallay</HI> Language, said to be sent us from the King; being an Order to us, with all possible speed to get our Goods aboard our Ships, and depart his Coun∣trey; he pressing us to the most speedy compliance possible therewith, as we stood in awe of the Kings Displeasure.</P>
<P>We were since informed that there was a great Dispute between the King and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Major, before he could be brought to Order us out of his Countrey, well considering how great a Support to, and Inrichment of his Kingdom our Trade had been: But being wholly under the <HI>Dutch</HI> Power, he was forced to comply, and we to his Commands; and so purposed with all possible speed to get off our Goods, and depart for <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>But our Ships being most of them nigh full, we were necessitated to request a Ship of near five hun∣dred Tuns, of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Major, to export them; so the next Morning we wrote a Letter to him, which we sent by four of the Companies Servants, to deliver; who coming to the <HI>Fort,</HI> the Captain of the Guard told them he was asleep: Where∣upon they left it with him, and returned home.</P>
<P>But whilst we were expecting of an Answer, the same evening comes to us the abovesaid Minister and Votary to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> with the said Letter unopen∣ed, seating himself at the upper end of our Table, and filling our Great Hall with his followers, cal∣ling
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>for Mr. <HI>Barwell,</HI> and some others of the Coun∣cil, who coming before him, he takes forth the Let∣ter, and tells us with Rage, the <HI>King</HI> had sent him to know the meaning of that Papers being found on the Ground under the <HI>Fort</HI>-Walls, <HI>aggravating</HI> it as a Cause of the highest Suspition, now in time of War; and when we had told him what it was, and laboured to make him sensible that it was our <HI>Europe</HI> Custom to signifie our Minds in Writing, and that our Meaning therein was most innocent, he replied, he admired how we durst presume to write to the Major without first acquainting the <HI>King;</HI> and all this with so much Passion and Fury, that nothing could look more like a Prologue to a Massacre; till at length he mildly advised us the next morning to go and ask the <HI>King</HI>'s Pardon.</P>
<P>Many other Circumstances of Amazement in this Business did pass, too tedious to represent: But by what we have said, you may <HI>imagine</HI> the baseness of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who were the whole Contrivers and Au∣thors of this Business, as did plainly appear by that Letter being delivered into their hands, and the <HI>King</HI>'s not <HI>mentioning</HI> one word to us about it, the next <HI>Morning,</HI> notwithstanding we never offered to ask him Pardon.</P>
<P>But this is but little to their <HI>succeeding Treatments,</HI> as you will see by what follows: That day we had sent off two of our Ships Boats full of <HI>Broad∣cloath,</HI> which without the Rivers Mouth were fol∣lowed by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pinnace, <HI>ordering,</HI> them <HI>back again,</HI> or else they would fire at them.</P>
<P><HI>Their Return surprized us; but not knowing but its being late at night, might be the occasion, we sent them
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>again the next morning, when they were again stopped by the</HI> Dutch <HI>Souldiers quartering a little below our Facto∣ry, who told us they had Orders to suffer no loaden Boat of ours to go out of the River: we complained to the Major, who told us it was the King's Order; who, alas poor man! had so Ʋn-King'd himself, that he could Com∣mand no further than stood with the Pleasure of the</HI> Dutch; <HI>but many hours did not pass before we understood the depth of the Design, by one</HI> Jacob de Roy, <HI>a Lieutenant in the</HI> Dutch <HI>Army, who had been with the King all the time of his being besieged in the Fort, coming some few Months before, under pretence of being a Baker to</HI> Ban∣tam, <HI>who brought us a Charge of about ten thousand Ri∣als</HI> 8/8 <HI>for Jewels and Plate of his in the</HI> Dutch <HI>Factory, which at the time of the Old King's entering the Town, he said we had plundered and taken into ours, which till we satisfied, none of our Goods should be permitted to go on board, where by the way, you may observe, first, their de∣sign so far to amaze and affright us, that we might upon any Terms be willing to leave the shoar; and then having so prepared us, to enrich themselves with the Companies and our Estate. Indeed this Business at that time start∣led us, and made us very thoughtful concerning them, much fearing some ill Designes upon us, we laboured by Presents to the King's Ministers, to learn the depth of the Design, and divert it; but in conclusion found them too much the</HI> Dutch <HI>Votaries, to be our Friends: insomuch that we were wholly to seek what to do: Whilst to perplex us yet further, comes a Message to us, that the King was jea∣lous of our assisting his Fathers Boats with Powder from our Ship in the Road, therefore desired us to deliver up all on Board them, which, when we departed, should be faith∣fully restored.</HI></P>
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
<P>We replied, That when we delivered our Powder, we delivered our Ships, they being without it whol∣ly defenceless, therefore would upon no Terms do it, but would our selves go speak with the King, which accordingly we did; when coming into his presence were prevented saying any thing to him, he immediately sending for a Letter wrote in <HI>Por∣tugueze</HI> and directed to the English as from one of the Old Kings Sons, which he ordered to be read to us; the Contents were, That we the <HI>French</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> and the <HI>Portugueze,</HI> should at a certain time be in readiness for their Assi∣stance, but where or how, we knew not; which he aggravated highly against us, not per∣mitting to speak in our defence, or to say any thing concerning the stoppage of our Goods, or our Powder being demanded out of our Ships, and bid us be gone; from whom being departed, we went to the Dutch Major, making known our Grievance to him, who smilling, told us, All was by Order of the King, though done by their Souldiers, and seem'd ignorant of the Letter, tho nothing more probable than that it was of their own framing; and promised in ge∣neral Terms to assist us to his power: so took our leaves, and being return'd to our Factory, we heard the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Ship was seized on by the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Javas</HI> together, with an Account of the said Letter, and that the <HI>French</HI> had ta∣ken out of her of theirs 4 Chests of Money, ha∣ing put the same on board of her for security in the time of the Siege: And that the aforesaid
<PB N="12" REF="8"/><HI>Jacob de Roy</HI> with some other Souldiers of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and Kings, went to the Honourable Com∣panies Ship the <HI>Tywan Frigat,</HI> acquainting the Commander they had Orders to search for Powder; who telling them they had none, neither could permit thereof without Orders from us ashore: They were about to enter the Ship, he immediately gave the word for his Men to stand to their Arms, where∣upon they desisted, gave him good words, and desired that only <HI>Jacob de Roy</HI> and one <HI>Ja∣va</HI> Man, might be permitted to look between Decks for satisfaction of the King, which being granted they departed. This News I say, with our Treatment with the King and Major, seem'd almost to confirm to us some evil Designs, if not upon our Lives, at least upon the Companies and our Estates. But it being no time to sit still, we concluded immediately to dis∣patch away the <HI>Formosa Frigat</HI> (a small Ship of the Companies) to <HI>Batavia,</HI> to make our Com∣plaints to the General and Council there, but chiefly to secure the Honourable Companies Treasure, which was the thing they seem'd to gape at, My self and Mr. <HI>George Chowne</HI> were sent upon her, and indeed it was our de∣sires to go, having had notice that the King had been solicited by the <HI>Dutch Renegado</HI> (a Villain fitted for the worst of Actions) to come to our Factory and kill us in particular, upon account of our being seen in his Enemies Camp at the time of his being besieged; to which altho he
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>declin'd condiscending, who knew what the importunity of such a Villain in time might a∣mount to. We departed the Shore in a small Boat, about <HI>half an hour</HI> before Sun set, with Order for all the Companies Treasure on board the Companies other Ships, to be put on board her in the dark, and with the smallest noise possible to weigh <HI>Anchor,</HI> lest we should have been discovered by the <HI>Dutch Ships.</HI> There ac∣companied us the Agents Lady, Mr. <HI>Thomas James</HI> late Chief of <HI>Tonkeene,</HI> Mr. <HI>Rich. Burn∣by,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Griffith,</HI> who being out of the Company's Service, had kept themselves aboard Ship for their security, which made our passage seem shorter, being of it self a little long, even four days, before we arrived at <HI>Ba∣tavia,</HI> where Mr. <HI>George Chowne</HI> the same day we arrived died: I went to the General, and was appointed the next day to be heard; when being admitted before him and all the Lords sit∣ting in Council, I made a Relation of our Treatments at <HI>Bantam,</HI> requesting a Ship of a∣bout 500 Tons Burthen, for the Exportation of our Goods, and their Orders to their people there, to permit them to be brought off; with their permission to hire an house in <HI>Batavia,</HI> and land our Goods, to Export them as we had occasion, Custom free; to all which we received then lit∣tle reply, being deferred for Answer till next day, when another of the Honourable Companies Ships, to wit, the <HI>Returne,</HI> arriv'd with Mr. <HI>Ed∣ward Barwell,</HI> to whose turn by lot it came to come away (so willing were all the Gentlemen
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>left there of Council to come away, that they could no other ways agree who should) the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Bantam</HI> not having any of our Goods at his departure to be brought off. And their pro∣ceedings being such, under Colour of the Kings Orders, as forced our people to take care to se∣cure what Estate the Company had already off the Shore, he and I again waited on the General, who told us, That we might hire an House where we pleas'd, that he would order a Ship or two, if occasion was, by the first opportunity; as likewise, that our Goods should be all safely brought avvay, and for vvhat vve had further requested, vvould after they had debated it, give Ansvver: But before his Order reached <HI>Bantam,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> there seeing two of our Ships gone a∣way in the Night time, and imagining in them to be the chiefest Treasure, permitted them to load the other small one and Sloop there remain∣ing, putting the King upon hastening our peo∣ple away, with all speed imaginable, seizing all the Provisions in the Factory, that they were forced to live the day before they left the Shore upon the Charity of the <HI>Chiness.</HI> And on the 12th of <HI>April</HI> arrived here the <HI>Tywan Frigat,</HI> vvith all our People from <HI>Bantam,</HI> except one Factor, who as if by mistake stayed behind to have an Eye to their Actions. At their departure they sealed up all the Companies Ware-houses, leaving a Register of their Effects and Factory (be∣ing as near as vve could guess about the value of 22000 <HI>Royals of Eight</HI>) vvith one of the <HI>Dutch
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>Commissioners</HI> to be delivered, the Major being here arrived, the General desired us, to send back in their Ships three or four Factors to take care of the Shipping of our Goods, which was done accordingly, but in so confus'd a manner, as what the <HI>Dutch</HI> pleased to restore us, we can on∣ly call ours: So ended the Honourable Compa∣nies antient Factory of <HI>Bantam,</HI> where the Eng∣lish have been settled, and have had a constant Trade about this 70 years. I cannot say they departed thence like <HI>Hannibal</HI> out of <HI>Africk,</HI> accusing both Gods and Men, with imprecations on themselves for any omissions of their own; but truly did severely repine at the Kings ingratitude to (as I may call us) the Nurses and Fathers of his Country, the <HI>English</HI> being by his <HI>Father</HI> and all the Inhabitants generally so acknowledged; and not undeservedly, having by their Trade en∣rich'd it, and brought it to what it was. And so great was our rage against the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as had our power been consonant to our will, I am con∣fident should have treated them much worse than the <HI>Javas.</HI> Since our departure, they have had some Skirmishes with the Old Kings people; with the loss thereby and Sickness (as is report∣ed) 7 or 800 White Men, as yet have not been able to proceed further than the <HI>Fort</HI> and <HI>Town</HI> of <HI>Bantam.</HI> But their Ships being now arrived from <HI>Europe</HI> with a supply of near 1000 fresh Souldiers, 'tis reported they design speedily to March for <HI>Tertiassa</HI> the Residence of the Old King, about 20 Miles distant from <HI>Bantam:</HI> What their success will be time will shew.

<PB N="16" REF="10"/>Sea the Old Kings Forces has done them several Damages, taken 16 or 17 Sloops and small Ves∣sels, and 'tis said burnt a Ship of near 800 Tons; so that they are forced to send <HI>Convoys</HI> with their <HI>Fleet</HI> of small Vessels to and from the Coast of <HI>Java.</HI> But leaving them to their Hostility a∣gainst each other, I shall proceed to a short Re∣lation of our Treatment since our Arrival here, where as I said we had liberty to hire an House. But as to Matters of Trade were deferr'd An∣swer, and that for nigh four Months, the Ge∣neral telling us every time we came into his pre∣sence we should have Answer sometimes to mor∣row, sometimes in few days; and this they did to perplex and intreague our Affairs, having, Ships arrived from <HI>Europe,</HI> designed for the Northward, that required a speedy dispatch, and till received an Answer, were not permitted to bring any Goods on shore, neither suffered they any of their people to go on board us: so that we were forced to put Goods from one Ship to the o∣ther, in order to dispatching them, with so much trouble as can scarce be imagined, and at last (<HI>Eymay</HI> being lost) sent two for <HI>Canton,</HI> one for <HI>Tywan,</HI> one for <HI>Tonkeene,</HI> and the <HI>Oacklander</HI> making a 9 Months passage, with the loss of all her Men but 7, was thereby disabled from proceeding to <HI>Canton,</HI> and forced with most black. Saylors to go for <HI>Surrat</HI> in Company with the <HI>Return:</HI> At last comes an Answer to our several Letters and Requests, that in this long Attendance we had presented to the General and Council. The Contents are too tedious to recite, but conclud∣ing
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>with an Order to us, our Residence here not consisting with their Interest, with all possible speed to with-draw our Ships and all our people to some of our own settled Factories, as <HI>Siam, Surrat, Persia,</HI> the Coast of <HI>Cormandell, Bangall,</HI> or where we thought best, and the Season of the year would best permit, except all parts belong∣ing to the King of <HI>Bantam,</HI> who they said had for a reciprocal kindness, by Contract made over all his Terretories to them; stiling the Old King his Father a Rebel against him: by which means there was no place left for us in these parts, where we could attend the Arrival of our <HI>Europe</HI> or Northward Ships, till the Company were made sensible of the loss of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and had taken some Order about their Affairs in these parts. This was a pretty unexpected Story indeed, which made us laugh, but on the wrong side of our Mouths, as the Saying is. The Companies Af∣fairs and our own too highly requiring our long∣er stay here, we were forced to give Answer to their Letter more modestly than we should o∣therwise have done; representing the unspeaka∣ble damage will occurr to our Masters Affairs, by their forcing us off; humbly Requesting per∣mission to abide here till they were acquainted in what condition their Trade in these parts was, and had taken some Order thereabout; to which as yet we have received no Answer, and have hopes they will not urge our departure. If they do, we must do as well as we can, we are bound to see it, and to sit dovvn and repine at our Infelici∣ties, vvill not help us. But the Season is novv
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>so far spent, that if so, <HI>England</HI> of necessity must be our next Port, unless we can find some place in the Streight of <HI>Sundy</HI> to shelter our selves. In the mean time we sit idle, and unable to turn a Penny; the time of our abode here, is so much time wholly lost: For my particular, could my Affairs have permitted, I should have return'd to you by this Ship; but having the Books of the Charge I had in <HI>Bantam</HI> to make up, and my Stock all abroad, that it cannot be in readiness till the latter Ship, which may depart about <HI>January</HI> next; when if I can be permitted, I de∣sign home. The last thing I have to advise you, is the loss of the <HI>Johanna,</HI> bound for <HI>Bangall,</HI> who run ashore in the Night upon a Ridge of Rocks, between the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> and Cape <HI>Agullis,</HI> where in 12 hours time she broke in two pieces; 'twas about two Miles distant from the shore, where all the Men but seven arrived, some in Boats, some on Rafts, some on the Rack of the Ship, but were 21 days travelling before they arrived where the <HI>Dutch</HI> Inhabited; they all came from <HI>Batavia</HI> in <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, and the Captain and some others take their passage home in this Ship. The Company lost 72000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling Treasure, beside other Merchandize.</P>
<P>I fear you will think me somewhat tedious in relating these sad and tragical Stories, but I was willing to give you a full Relation of all Occurrances. I could wish the Subject had been more plea∣sant, and less tragical; but we must submit to the Divine Will.</P>
