<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S there is no great action, which tendeth to the aduancement of a</HI> publique good, but it requireth certaine degrees of timely proceeding, and neuerthelesse meeteth with diuers impediments; some by accident, and some by practise: So is there nothing that doeth more adorne the true Maiestie and greatnesse of Soueraigne Princes, then to be con∣stant in their wel-grounded Resolutions, and by their policie and law∣full power, to scatter and beat downe all difficulties, and vndue opposi∣tions, vntil they haue conducted their Actions to a good and happy end: Wee therefore, hauing propounded vnto Our selues; as a principall worke of Our times, to or∣deine and prouide, that the great commoditie of Broad-cloth, being one of the principall Dowries of Our Kingdome, may receiue the due Manufactures of Dying and Dressing within the Realme; did to that end publish Our Royall Proclamation, dated the three and twentieth day of <HI>Iuly</HI> last, prohibiting and ordeyning, That no Broad-cloth, of what sort soeuer, made here within this Our Kingdome of <HI>England,</HI> should be Exported Vndied and Vndrest, after the second day of <HI>Nouember</HI> next ensuing the date of Our said Proclamation: Which time was giuen, aswell for the Merchant Aduenturers, to vent their Whites, which might be vpon their hands, as for the preparing of di∣uers things, necessary to the setling of the new Trade of Died and dressed Clothes. And We did further by Our said Proclamation promise <HI>in the Word of a King</HI> to all Our louing Subiects, that should vndertake to Export the said Broad-clothes in their true Manufactures, that neither the Charter of the Merchant Aduenturers, nor any other Licences or Dispensations by <HI>Non obstantes,</HI> contrary to Our Lawes, heretofore granted by Vs, or any Our Predecessors, should be any maner of preiudice, impeachment, disturbance, or interruption to such, as should after the time aforesaid vent the said Clothes Died and Dressed, according to Our said Royall Ordinance and constitution; but should be from the said second day of <HI>Nouember,</HI> declared to be annihilated, &amp; made void to all in∣tents and purposes. At which time of the publishing of Our said Proclamation, We did expect that the said Charter of the Merchant Aduenturers should, before the said second day of <HI>Nouember,</HI> haue bene in due forme of Law surrendred: But after, finding the said Company of Merchant Aduentu∣rers to make difficulty concerning the Surrender of their Patent; We haue bene enforced through
<PB REF="2" MS="y"/> their wilfulnesse and inconformitie, aswell to order a Legall course to be taken for the ouerthrowe of their said Patent: as also to license diuers of Our louing Subiects, that haue very worthily, and with great alacrity, vndertaken to set vp and manage the said Trade of Dyed and Dressed Clothes, to export also Whites in the meane while, vntill such time as the said Patent of the Mer∣chant Aduenturers shall be by iudgement euicted, and some respite of time afterwards, lest there might haue ensued some stand of the vent of Cloth before the new Trade were setled: But for as much as the course of a iudiciall proceeding, though in a Case neuer so cleare &amp; plaine, must haue due formes &amp; times obserued according to the rules of Law, &amp; for that time in this case is exceeding pre∣cious, and that it is not possible for the new intended Company, to goe on with that confidence and incouragement, that in so great a businesse were fit, as long as the Charter of the Merchant-Aduen∣turers is put in vre, and practise:</P>
<P>Therefore to remoue and discharge all discouragements and impediments: Wee doe by these presents prohibite, forbid, constitute and ordeine, That from henceforth the Charter of the said Mer∣chant aduenturers, and all powers, Lycences, authorities, priuiledges, formes of gouernement contained in the same, or otherwise all vsages, holding of Courts, meetings, assemblies, and all o∣ther proceedings, by colour or vertue thereof, together with all the dependances, be not from hence∣foorth put in any manner of practise or execution, either in the parts beyond the Seas, or here with∣in Our Kingdome. And to that end, Wee doe not onely notifie and publish this Our Royall pro∣hibition and ordinance, aswell to all Forreiners, as to all Our louing Subiects, to whom it may ap∣pertaine: But doe furthermore straitly and expresly charge and commaund, aswel the Gouernour, Deputie, or Deputies, and Assistants of the said Company of the Merchant Aduentu∣rers, as the whole bodie of them, and also euery of them in particuler, and all their Factors, Ser∣uants and Ministers, aswell beyond the Seas, as on this side, within Our Kingdome and Domi∣nions; That from this time forwards, they doe in no wise presume, directly or indirectly, to doe, performe, or execute any Trade, Traffique, or Marchandizing, into, or from any the Countryes, or places where the said Merchant Aduenturers, are, or haue beene priuiledged, or any point or thing whatsoeuer, by vertue or colour of their said Charter, or by vertue of any former treatie or treaties, betwixt any Our noble Progenitors, or Predecessors, and any Prince or Potentate, Citie or politique Gouernment, or former vsages, vpon paine of Our High indignation, imprisonment, and other pu∣nishment, which by Our Lawes or Prerogatiue Royall, may bee inflicted vpon them: Letting them know, that We shall proceede against euery such offender, as a contemner of Our Royall Commandement, and a disturber of so excellent a worke, wherein We haue so farre declared Our selues for the Vniuersall Weale, and comfort of Our people.</P>
<P>Prouided neuerthelesse, that where Our Treasurer of England hath directed his Letters to the Officers of Our Custome-house, and Ports, giuing libertie of importation, onely vntill the last of this present Moneth of <HI>December:</HI> That these presents shall not any way countermaund the said limitation of time so prefixed, &amp; no longer: But that the said Merchant-Aduenturers, may during that time importe accordingly; any thing before in these presents, to the contrary notwithstanding.</P>
