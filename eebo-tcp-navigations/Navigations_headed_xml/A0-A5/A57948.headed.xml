<HEAD>MOREA, <HI>sometime called</HI> PELOPONNESUS, <HI>and by the</HI> Turks MORA.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Isthmus</HI> or <HI>Hexamile</HI> is a Neck of Land which joyneth it to the Continent of <HI>Greece,</HI> and makes it a <HI>Peninsula.</HI> The Length is about ten Miles, and the Breadth at the narrowest place not above Six. There are the Ruines of Three Castles, and a Wall which reacht from the City of <HI>Canchrea</HI> on the <HI>Egean</HI> Sea, to <HI>Lechaeum</HI> on the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto.</HI> There is also a Valley where they endeavoured to have both Seas joyn'd.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>CORINTH, by the <HI>Turks</HI> GOƲRDESE,</HEAD>
<P>Is an Ancient City which stands on a Rising Ground, about Two Miles from the Sea of the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto.</HI> The Houses are much scattered, having many Fields amongst them, together with which they take up above three Miles in compass. There are many pleasant Gardens with all sorts of Fruits. The Houses here are more for Trade and Pleasure than Security, most having other Houses up in the Castle, which stands upon a Hill. To this they retreat when any Pyrats come to annoy them, which is often in the Summer time; they coming with their <HI>Briganteens,</HI> to the <HI>Isth∣mus,</HI> which is not above six Miles off. The Hill on which the Castle stands is very high, it was formerly called the <HI>Acro Corinthus,</HI> and is very steep round a∣bout; the part towards the West, North and North
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>East being almost Perpendicular. It is above two Miles from the Town to the Castle. The way up is much winding, and also steep. The Hill is all Stone. The For∣tifications are very Ancient. There are two Walls before you pass into the chiefest part of the Castle. The Hill is Walled round at the Top, which is above three Miles. There are some Guns which are of no other use than to Salute any Great Person, or to fire on their Festi∣vals. From the Northermost part is one of the most pleasant Prospects the World affords, looking into the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto, Aegean</HI> Sea, and several Mountains at great distance, together with those most pleasant Plains of <HI>Corinth,</HI> and <HI>Basilico,</HI> which abound with Olive-trees, Vine-yards, and many small Vil∣lages. In the Castle the Land is good, where are many Pasture Fields, and plenty of Water, so as it may endure a long Siege; to the West there is a Spring which gusheth out from the Top of the Hill, and fall∣eth down above Fifty Fathome. In the Plains of <HI>Co∣rinth</HI> were the first Currant Vines Planted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>VOSTIZA,</HEAD>
<P>Is about twenty Miles within the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> Seated on a Rising Ground about a Quar∣ter of a Mile from the Sea-side. It is but a small Town without any Fortifications. The Plain about it affords Corn, Currants, and Wine, Olive-trees there are not many, it lying too open to the Norther∣ly Winds, which bring very cold Blasts from the Mountains on the other side the Gulph. The Moun∣tains to the South, are not above Five Miles from the Town, which are very high, and continue to the Plains of <HI>Basilico,</HI> betwixt which and the Sea is the Road to <HI>Corinth,</HI> which is very bad way to pass in the Winter, there being no cut Rivers, and the Floods over∣flowing
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>make several Waters, some above a Mile broad. There are no Inhabitants between the Plain of <HI>Basilico</HI> and this Place, nor is the Soil good, being most Stony, and having many Woods, nor is it above two Miles from the Sea to the Mountains in most places. There is no Port at <HI>Vostiza,</HI> nor any Shelter for Boats on all this side of the Gulph.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>PARTRASS, formerly called PATRA,</HEAD>
<P>Is an Ancient City. It stands about Nine Miles without the Castles, at the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Le∣panto,</HI> on a Hill about a Quarter of a Mile from the Sea. The greatest part of the Town runs down to∣wards the South East, overlooking the Plain. The Houses are thick, and are above two Miles about, in∣cluding the Castle, which stands to the North above the Town. The Castle is well built, having very high Walls, to the Eastward is a dry Ditch with a low Wall; towards the Sea is a round Tower well built, high and strong, which has Six very long Guns to com∣mand the Road, but they lye too high to do any harm to Ships, except a Shot should chance to hit any of the Masts. There are many Ruines about the City. To the Eastward is a very great Mountain, the Foot of which is about ten Miles from the Town. The Plain is very delightsome, having many pleasant Gardens with all sorts of Fruits. The largest, and best Le∣mons are here of any place in the <HI>Morea:</HI> At the Sea side there are only a few Store-houses. About a Quar∣ter of a Mile from them to the South, are the Ruines of a Great Church which was Dedicated to St. <HI>Andrew.</HI> There are no Fortifications by the Sea-side nearer than the Castles at the Gulph. In the Summer time there is a continual Watch by the Sea-side, of both Horse and Foot; the Town dividing into several Parties, one
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>Party goes down every night scouting along the Marine, not suffering any Boats to come a shore till it be Day. Before this place was the great fight betwixt the <HI>Christians</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> in <HI>October</HI> 1571. when the <HI>Christians</HI> were Victorious.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>GASTON, formerly called ELIS,</HEAD>
<P>Stands in a very large Plain about Eight Miles from the Bay of <HI>Chiarenza.</HI> The Houses are very much scatter'd; without Walls or any Fortification. The greatest part of the Inhabitants are Husbandmen. The Country about it is very pleasant. There are several large Woods about it. The Land is most Plow'd, and Pasture Land, having very few Olive or Fruit trees. In the time of War with the <HI>Ve∣netians,</HI> here is usually a <HI>Bassha</HI> with a Number of Horse. who guard the Coast. There is no Fortification by the Sea-side from the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto</HI> to <HI>Navareene,</HI> ex∣cept the Castle of <HI>Arcadia</HI> a Mile from the Sea. From <HI>Partrass</HI> to <HI>Gaston</HI> the way is plain, and so continues to <HI>Navardene</HI> a long the Sea side. The Black Mountains, and Castle <HI>Tornese</HI> are left on the Lest hand.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>Castle TORNESE, by the <HI>Turks</HI> called CLOMƲTCH,</HEAD>
<P>Stands on a high Hill on a Promontory, the most West of all the <HI>Morea.</HI> It is about Six Miles from the Ruines of <HI>Chiarenza,</HI> and not above Eighteen Miles from the Island of <HI>Zante.</HI> At Sea it seems to be an Island. The Castle is well built, having the Walls very high, but much out of repair. It has no Ditch about it, nor has it any other Strength than from the Scituation, not having above twenty Guns. Under the Walls is a small Town where Sir <HI>Henry Hide</HI> (who was sometime Consul for the <HI>English</HI> Nation in the <HI>Morea</HI>) lived in great State, built a small Church, and a fair House with many Gardens and Vine-yards
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>about it. The Church remains entire. The Scituation is very pleasant, and was by the <HI>Venetians</HI> called <HI>Bel videre.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>ARCADIA, formerly called CYPARISSA,</HEAD>
<P>Stands in a Great Bay about a Mile from the Sea. The Castle and Town stand on scragged Rocks, under high Mountains. The Castle is much out of repair, nor can it be made strong to resist any Enemy, the Moun∣tains so overlooking it. Before it is a pleasant Plain along the Sea side. It has no Harbour for Shipping, so that they carry their Oyl and other Merchandize to <HI>Navareene.</HI> In time of Peace with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> they carry them to <HI>Zante.</HI> The Town is small and not much inhabited.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>NAVAREENE, formerly called PYLƲS,</HEAD>
<P>Has the best Harbour in all the <HI>Morea.</HI> It is about five Miles long, and three broad, having an Island ly∣ing before it called <HI>Spactoria.</HI> Formerly there where two Entrances into the Harbour, but in the Year 1571, when the <HI>Christians</HI> obtained the great Victory over the <HI>Turks</HI> before the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto;</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> ha∣ving several Ships, and Gallies in the Harbour, and fearing the <HI>Christians</HI> would come in and destroy them, stopped up the Entrance to the West of the Island (so as only small Boats can now pass;) and built a very strong Castle to the Eastward called New <HI>Navareene,</HI> which is very well built, and commands the Entrance. It has about Forty Guns, which are most towards the Sea. The Land to the South East lies high. To the west end of the Harbour stands Old <HI>Navareene</HI> (formerly called <HI>Pylus</HI>) on a high Hill very steep; the Walls are very much out of repair, great part
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>being fallen down, there are very few Inhabitants in it. It might be made impregnable, no hills being near it. I cannot say whether they have any Guns in it. This place in other Maps is put down above 20 Miles from the Sea, and the Island of <HI>Spactoria</HI> (which makes the Harbour) left out.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>MODON,</HEAD>
<P>Is a very strong Castle which stands on a low Point of Land. The Sea washeth the Foundations of the Walls above three Quarters round: the Walls are very high. The Port is to the Eastward, it hath a small Mole to con∣tain two or three Gallies; the Port is not secure for Ships, South West Winds having too great Power here. To the South lies the Island of <HI>Sapienza</HI> about two Miles from the Point of the Castle. To command the Passage a round Tower is built, which hath several great Guns, that lye equal with the Water. Towards the Land by the Port is a dry Ditch five Yards deep, and about twenty Yards broad, between which and the main Castle is a very strong Battery of a∣bout ten Guns. There is a dry Ditch, and Draw-bridges to pass into the Body of the Castle. To the North West is another Battery to secure that Mount, where are very good Guns. On the Walls towards the Port are three Towers, in each of which are small Guns: in all, they say, here are about One hundred Guns. The Town stands about half a Mile from the Castle, being inhabited by <HI>Greeks.</HI> In the Port is a small Island on which a Battery might be raised and do much harm to the Castle, it being as high as the Walls. The Castle is above a Mile about.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>CORON,</HEAD>
<P>Is scituated on a Point of Land which runs out about half a Mile. It is much higher towards the Land then
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>at the Point. The Sea goes two Thirds about it. The Walls are high, and their Foundations on scraggy Rocks. The Fortification is in much better repair than at <HI>Modon.</HI> Towards the Land the Walls are above Forty Foot high, and here is a round Tower above Six∣ty Foot high, in which are several very good Guns to answer the Land, which runs higher than the Walls. At the Southward part of the Castle the Land goes sloping down towards the Sea side, from the Walls of the Castle, the ground is not Rocky in that part. There are about seventy good Guns about the Wall, and several of the Works are Arch'd over. To the North is a round Tower which stands low to command the Road. Here is no Harbour for Gallies, nor is the Road very secure. It had formerly a good Mole which is now sunk; which, with other Ruines has so choak'd up the harbour, that most buoy up their Cables with Cask to keep them from ground.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>CALAMATA, formerly called THƲRIƲM,</HEAD>
<P>Is at the bottom of the Bay of <HI>Coron,</HI> about a Mile from the Sea. The Castle is but small. The Town is near a Mile in Circumference, well Peopled, standing on a rising Ground. To the West is a very large and fertile Plain, in which are many <HI>Greek</HI> Villages, and two small Towns, the one called <HI>Cochiuk Magna,</HI> the other <HI>Niscia.</HI> The latter is most small Islands, which little Rivers make. (<HI>Niscia</HI> signifying Islands in the Vulgar <HI>Greek.</HI>) The Plain about <HI>Calamata</HI> towards the Sea is all planted with Vineyards, Olive, Figg and Mulberry-trees. On the West part of the Bay by the Sea side, are the Ruines of Old <HI>Messina,</HI> which the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> besieged with a powerful Army. The <HI>Messineses</HI> seeing they were not able to withstand their Enemies Power, fired their City, imbarked themselves, and went to <HI>Sicilia,</HI> where they built the present City of <HI>Messina.</HI></P>

<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>MESITHA, formerly called LACEDEMON,</HEAD>
<P>Is scituated at the side of a large Plain on a rising Ground, about twenty five Miles from the Sea side, having very high Mountains all to the West of the Plain. The Castle stands to the West on a very high Hill, steep on the West, and South part, where it is inac∣cessable, but sloping to the North, having two old Walls which cross the Hill from the North to the South, di∣viding the Hill almost into three Parts. The way into the Castle is very difficult. The Walls of the Castle are well built, but very old. It is near half a Mile about, having two Gates to be pass'd. The Town is large, and is esteemed the second for bigness in all the <HI>Morea,</HI> yet <HI>Patrass</HI> hath more houses. The Ruines about it are very great, and towards the South they reach above four Miles, having in some places the Foundation of a thick Wall, which they say was the Walls of <HI>Sparta.</HI> To the North about a Quarter of a Mile from the Town, is a great and high Building, which they say was an Arch of an Aquaeduct. The Plain is very pleasant, full of small Villages, Olive, and Mulberry trees. This Place and <HI>Calamata</HI> make more Silk than all the other parts of the <HI>Morea.</HI> The River which runs through the Plain is now called <HI>Vasili Pottamo.</HI> In Winter it spreads very large, but in Summer towards the City is almost dry. Tho' the City stands remote from the Sea, and free from dangers that ensue from thence; yet the <HI>Manjotts</HI> are a People apt to prey upon them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>MAINA, which some write BRAZZO di MAINA,</HEAD>
<P>Is that Country where the <HI>Manjotts</HI> inhabit. It lies West of the Plain of <HI>Misitha,</HI> and so runs down to the Sea, being Mountanous and full of Woods, and very
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>difficult to come at, either by Sea, or Land. In the Year 1667, they rebelled and sent to the <HI>Venetians</HI> and <HI>Mal∣teses</HI> who came to their assistance, bringing with them Powder, and other Ammunition. Many Parties of them would often make Incursions into the <HI>Turks</HI> Do∣minions, and did much harm. But the Captain <HI>Bassha,</HI> who went with Forty Gallies, to relieve a Castle called <HI>Zarnata,</HI> reduced them to their former Obedience. Articles were drawn up, in which the <HI>Manjotts</HI> con∣sented to pay a small Tribute. Yet do they continue to cruise about with their <HI>Briganteens.</HI> If they take any <HI>Turks,</HI> they sell them to the <HI>Malteses,</HI> and <HI>Legor∣neses,</HI> as they do the <HI>Christians</HI> to the <HI>Turks.</HI> If any Ship come to Anchor on their Coast, many arm them∣selves and go to the place, over against where the Ship doth ride; some of them will be in Priests Habits, walk∣ing by the Sea side, with their Wallets, in which they will have some Wine and Bread. Their Companions lye hid behind the Bushes at some convenient Post. When any strangers come ashore, who do not under∣stand their Language, the feigned Priests make signs to them, shewing them their Bread and Wine, which they offer to them for money, by which the strangers being enticed from the Sea fide (and it may be to sit down and tast their Wine) the hidden <HI>Manjotts</HI> come and make their Prey. The Priests will seem to be sorry, and endeavour to make the strangers believe they were altogether ignorant of any such design. So a white Flagg is put out, and a Treaty held with the Ship for their Ransome. The Priests endeavour to moderate the Price, shewing a great deal of respect to their Com∣panions, who are cloathed in <HI>Turkish</HI> Habits. Many Ships have been thus served. Such a business happen∣ed to some <HI>English</HI> Ships, who (having the Winds con∣trary) came to Anchor near the Island <HI>Cervi,</HI> (in one of which Sir <HI>Paul Rycaut</HI> was a Passenger going for
<PB N="10" REF="7"/><HI>Constantinople;</HI>) several Young Men were taken, and they paid dear for visiting the <HI>Manjotts,</HI> and though the Earl of <HI>Winchilsea,</HI> (then Embassadour (from his Majesty) at <HI>Constantinople</HI>) made complaint of it, no redress could be had. In the Plains are many Olive Trees, and Vine-yards: In the Woods there are many wild Vines. There are great quantities of Quailes, so as they Salt them up, and send them to several other parts. Powder and Shot is here scarce, but they do so well manage the Sling, as is to admiration, with which they kill Birds on the Wing. The Sea Ports in <HI>Maina,</HI> are, <HI>Chetri, Vitulo, Porto Quaglio, Yaracaria, Pagana, Rapana,</HI> with several other small Ports and Creeks, where they shel∣ter themselves when they are pursued. The Garrisons which the <HI>Turks</HI> have in <HI>Maine</HI> are <HI>Zarnata, Vitulo, Kifala,</HI> and <HI>Passava.</HI> Here are two Famous Pyrats, the one called <HI>Manetta,</HI> the other <HI>Giracare,</HI> being the chief for Family and Power amongst them.</P>

<HEAD>MALƲASIA, formerly called EPIDAƲRES,</HEAD>
<P>Is a strong Castle standing on a Rock about twenty Miles to the North of the Cape St. <HI>Anzolo</HI> in the <HI>Ar∣chipelago.</HI> It has a narrow and difficult Passage to the Continent. It is very well Fortified with good Works, having about 100 good Guns; notwithstanding it stands in the Sea, and seems to be all Rock, yet it hath on the top a fine Plain with Gardens and several Springs, with good Water. This place stands very convenient for transporting Men and Provision for <HI>Candy,</HI> not be∣ing above thirty Leagues distance from <HI>Canea:</HI> Hence the Visier <HI>Kupri-Ogle</HI> sailed when he went for <HI>Candy,</HI> and more Souldiers were Shipped from hence for <HI>Candy</HI> (in the late War) than from any other Port of <HI>Turky.</HI> It is very populous, and the Seamen are esteemed the best of any in these parts. Here are the choicest
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>Wines, esteemed at <HI>Venice</HI> to be the best of all in <HI>Greece.</HI></P>

<HEAD>NAPOLI,</HEAD>
<P>Is a large City, now the chief in all the <HI>Morea,</HI> being above two Miles in Compass, the Sea going almost round it. The houses stand thick, and very full of People. It is the Seat of the <HI>Bassha.</HI> The Castle is well seated to the North, standing above any part of the Town. There is but one way into the City by Land, which is at the side of high Mountains, very difficult. The Harbour is very secure, having a narrow entrance, passing Rocks so as but one Gally can come in at a time. Before which Entrance is a Fort built on low Rocks, where are several very good Guns. It stands about 300 Paces from the Haven, have shoal Water round about it. No Ships can come to hurt the City with their Shot, it being cover'd to Seaward from any danger, by high and strong Walls, on which and in the Castles are above 200 Guns.</P>

The Castle is seated on a Hill very pleasantly. The Walls are much gone to ruine, having but few Guns, and those without Carriages. The Ruines are above three miles about the Castle. The Plain is very delightsome, abounding with Wine, Oyl, and all sorts of Grain.</P>

<HEAD>TRAPOLIZZA, formerly called MEGALOPOLIS,</HEAD>
<P>Hath the Name of a City, tho' it be not so big as some Towns. It is now the chief place of all the (once Fa∣mous)
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>Province of <HI>Arcadia.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Mora Orta,</HI> that is, the Center or Middle of the <HI>Morea.</HI> Here are very rich <HI>Turks,</HI> who have their Wealth in Land and Cattle; most being Graziers and Husbandmen. This is the only place which deserves the Name of a Town in the whole Province. The Great <HI>Moske</HI> was former∣ly a Heathen Temple. The Houses are very mean: The <HI>Turks</HI> live most in their Farms, which they call Cheftlicks, not being in danger of Pyrats. The Province of <HI>Arcadia</HI> is all surrounded with Mountains, most of which are covered with Woods. Yearly they burn the Grass and Bryers to clear the ground against the Spring, then very good Pasture grows up in its stead. There hath been many Villages, some have been Cities, but now the <HI>Albaneses,</HI> (who are the Shep∣herds, and three times the Number, as the <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> which are in these parts) live most in Tents, re∣moving their Tents and Herds according to the season of the Year. In the Summer time they are up in the Mountains, and in the Winter they are in the Woods by the Sea side, being more or less Tents together. There are a sort of these <HI>Albaneses</HI> which have a great Village called <HI>Syleman,</HI> as the Mountains have the same Name. These <HI>Albaneses</HI> have often Rebelled and kept themselves up in the Mountains, doing much mischief by Robbery.

The Houses stand scattering between these several Walls, but the great∣est part are by the Sea-side. The Castle stands on the top of the Hill. It is kept in very good repair. There are about twenty very good Guns. The Port is almost Oval, having a very narrow Entrance. There is a Chain which passes from one side to the other. At each side of the Entrance are places for many Guns, tho' now they have not above three or four. The City is well Peopled being a Nest of Pyrats. It yielded to the <HI>Turk</HI> in the Year 1499, after a long Siege before. The <HI>Turks</HI> having the Castles at the Entrance into the Gulph, the <HI>Christians</HI> had no hopes of Relief, so were forced to yield themselves up to their Mercy, who gave them free leave to depart. In the time of War with the <HI>Venetians</HI> the <HI>Briganteens</HI> of this place were a continual Plague to the People of <HI>Zant,</HI> and <HI>Ceffalonia.</HI> A Famous Corsare of this place called <HI>Du∣rach Beigh,</HI> went with Eleven <HI>Briganteens</HI> and in the Night time Landed at <HI>Cherri,</HI> on the South part of the Island of <HI>Zant,</HI> taking away above 200 Slaves, and at Day break appeared before the Port of <HI>Zant</HI> with Colours flying, and firing his Guns, gave them notice of his Prize, almost as soon as they had the News by Land; so got safe to his Port with this great Success. The day before was a solemn Feast kept at <HI>Cherri,</HI> and many People came from the City of <HI>Zant</HI> to pay their Devotions to the <HI>Panaija</HI> there. Since the Peace with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> they go upon the Coast of <HI>Apuglia,</HI> and take poor Countrey-men, bringing them to miserable Slavery. The City of <HI>Lepanto</HI> hath the whole trade of the Gulph, here being the Customer who takes his Duties on all Boats that go in or out. The plains are very pleasant, at each side of the City, with many Olive-trees, and Vine-yards. To the East∣ward
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>of the City about a quarter of a Mile out of Town, there is a great Spring which gusheth out of a Rock at the Foot of a high Mountain; it divides into several Streams which makes some Islands, these Islands are most cut square, which are covered by vast high Plane-trees, that stand very thick, and so, as at Noon-day it is shady all about the Spring. In the Sum∣mer time here are continually many <HI>Turks,</HI> bringing their Victuals with them, and tarry most part of the day. About Fifteen Miles from hence, upon the same side of the Gulph, stands a small Village called <HI>Vitre∣nizza,</HI> near unto which Sir <HI>Giles Eastcourt</HI> was Buried, travelling in Company with Mr. <HI>Francis Vernon;</HI> and in his way towards Mount <HI>Parnassus,</HI> Sir <HI>Giles</HI> com∣plained in the Morning, but would not be perswaded to tarry at <HI>Lepanto,</HI> hoping it would pass: he called to his man to help him down, and in less then half an hour he Dyed, and was Buried with the assistance of <HI>Greek</HI> Priests, who live in <HI>Vitrenizza.</HI></P>
<P>There are two Castle at the Entrance of the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto:</HI> One is on the <HI>Morea</HI> shore, the other on <HI>Rumili;</HI> the Enterance between them is not above a Mile and a half, nor can any Ship pass without danger of being sunk, there being several Guns in each Castle which lye level with the Water. The Castles also sland very low.</P>

<HEAD>NATALICO,</HEAD>
<P>Is a large Town standing in a Bay, which hath lying before it, two Islands that keep off the main force of the Sea. From the Eastern part at the Entrance of the Bay up to the Town, is a <HI>Pescaria</HI> or Fishery, it being very shallow, and the bottom muddy, with Weeds; but that part to the Northward of the Town is very deep. No Boats of any Burthen can come within a
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>Mile of the Town, nor into that part above it. They have abundance of Monoxylos, or Cannows, which pass through narrow Channels; with these they carry all their Goods to, and from the Town. The Inhabi∣tants are <HI>Greeks,</HI> no <HI>Turks</HI> living with them, except some of the Customers Officers, the Customer himself living at <HI>Mezzalnnzi,</HI> a place about ten Miles distant, upon the side of this Bay. Both these Towns are well Peopled: Neither of them have any Fortification; no Enemy can come by Water to annoy them. On the Eastermost Island is a small Chappel called St. <HI>Sosti,</HI> against which Ships do Anchor when they come to load. Their Loading is brought from the Town to this Island with Monoxylos, from whence it is carried aboard in the Ships Boats.</P>

<P>THE Inhabitants of the <HI>Morea,</HI> are <HI>Turks, Greeks, Albaneses</HI> and <HI>T'Zackonians.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> for the most part live in, or under the Command of Castles, and at their Farms in the Country (where they some∣times are;) they have Towers built about Thirty Foot high, the Door of which is about ten Foot from the ground; against which a Wall with Stairs is built, a∣bout five Foot from the Tower, to which Wall a Draw-bridge is let down from before the Door where they enter: 'tis every Night drawn up to secure them from Pirats; some have only a Ladder, which they take up into the Tower. There is a continual Watch in the Summer time, all along the Sea Coasts. Of <HI>Turks'</HI> there are not above 30000 Inhabitants; the Christians are three times as many. The <HI>Greeks</HI> have free Exercise of their Religion. Their Priests are very ignorant; scarce any understanding the old <HI>Greek;</HI> nor are they so Superstitious in their worship to Pictures,
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>as those who live under the <HI>Venetians.</HI> They have several Monasteries. Near unto <HI>Vostiza</HI> is one, which is called, <HI>La Madona di Spiglia,</HI> it being at the side of a Mountain in a large Cave, where there is a Church, in which is the Picture of the Virgin <HI>MARY,</HI> which (they say) was brought hither from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> by Angels at the time when the <HI>Turks</HI> took that City. There was another <HI>Madona</HI> near <HI>Misithra,</HI> which did many Mi∣racles; and every Year great numbers of <HI>Greeks</HI> flock'd from all parts to pay their Devotions to it. The <HI>Bassha</HI> of the <HI>Morea</HI> having notice, went to see the Cere∣mony, telling the Priests he was desirous to see some Miracle; they telling him it had done many, he or∣dered one of his Men to bring him another Picture out of any House, which being brought, he asked the Priests what difference there was betwixt those two Pictures, they answered, that, that Picture which was in the Church was a most Sacred thing. But the <HI>Bassha</HI> caused a Fire to be made, and both Pictures to be put into it, saying, he would Worship that which escaped the Fire; but both were burnt, and the <HI>Bassha</HI> laugh∣ing at their Superstition, went his way. The Christians live much better here than in <HI>Asia.</HI> The vulgar <HI>Greek</HI> is the general Language, and there are few <HI>Turks</HI> but can speak it. Every Town hath <HI>Greek</HI> Elders which they call <HI>Yerondo's.:</HI> These appear upon all Publick Matters, and levy Taxes on the Towns-People, pro∣portionably to their Abilities. The <HI>Albaneses</HI> are of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church. They generally live not in Towns, yet have several Villages; one of which is very large, called <HI>Sylemen.</HI> It stands in the Mountains near the City of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> which Mountains have the same Name. They live most in Tents, being for the most part Shep∣herds. The <HI>T'Zackonians</HI> are most in Towns, they are a very poor People, serving as Porters, both Men and Women carrying very great Burthens. There are also a
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>great many Jews, who for the most part are Mer∣chants and Shop-keepers, living but poorly; the <HI>Athe∣nian</HI> Merchants supplying most of the Country with all sorts of Merchandizes, and chiefly from <HI>Venice.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> are very rich in their Cloathing here, their Vests being most made with fine <HI>Venice</HI> Cloth.</P>
<P>The Merchandizes of the <HI>Morea,</HI> or Product of the Land, are Olive-Oyl, Raw-Silk, Wax, Honey, Soap, Cordovan-skins, Sheep-skins, Butter, Cheese, Raisons, Currans, Figgs, Wines, Wheat, Barly, Rye, Oates, dry'd Acorns (which the <HI>Venetians</HI> call <HI>Valania,</HI> and which are used in <HI>Italy</HI> for Tanning of Leather, as we use the Bark of the Tree,) Fustick Wood, and Pernicoke Seed, which Seed is for Dyeing of Scarlet. It grows on a Shurb-Oak-tree, rising at the stemm of the Leaf, like a Blister, something bigger than a Pea, out of which comes Dust (or Powder) which being dry turns to small Worms, which when quickned they kill with Wine. The Soyl of the Land is very good. They Plow with two Oxen, and without Wheels, nor are they at the pains to dung the Ground. They have ma∣ny Weeds, and the Liquorice Root is very troublesome being deep. They reap their Corn much in the man∣ner as we do, but have no Barns, only Threshing-floors, (which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Chirman.</HI>) They are on high ground, and open to the Winds. Here they tread it out with Horses, which are made fast to a Post, round which the Corn is put; the Horses trampling upon it make great dispatch: with the Wind they cleanse it, and send it home to their Houses; that which they intend to keep they put into great Earthen Jarrs, and Baskets made with slit Canes, which Baskets are dawb∣ed over with wet Cow-dung, which being well dryed, not only keeps in the Corn, but also preserves it cool. The <HI>Turks</HI> are usually at these places with a Watch, well Armed (if near the Sea) all the time of the Corn
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>treading. They have great quantity of Grass, but make no Hay, feeding their Horses with chopt Straw and Barly; they Litter them with Horse-dung, which being dryed in the Sun, and shaken, falls asunder, and is very soft. In the Spring they feed them with green Barly, tying one of their hinder-leggs to a Stake, which they remove twice a day, keeping them to an allow∣ance. Besides the Common Grass, they have a sort of Clover Grass, which they give them Green, after their feeding on Barly, bringing it home to their Sta∣bles. In <HI>August</HI> the common Grass is usually parcht and dry, which therefore they burn, and new soon springs up in its place.</P>
<P>The Trees in the Woods are several sorts of Oaks, Pine, Firr, wild Chesnut and wild Pear.</P>
<P>In their Gardens they have Orange, Lemon, Citron, Pomegranate, Apricock, Peach, Plum, and Cherry-Trees; Apples and Pears they have not many, nor are they so good as usually they be with us; Cypress-trees and Wallnuts they are plenty. In the Plains near any Springs, are most stately Plane-trees, which are very shady. They have all sorts of Garden Herbs as we have, and great quantity of Musk-melons, Water Melons, and several sorts of Gourds.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>December,</HI> they begin to make Oyl, continuing it till the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> or accord∣ing as the quantity of Olives is. <HI>February, March,</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> are for making Butter and Cheese, also for sheer∣ing their Sheep. <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June</HI> is the time for cutting their Corn. In <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July</HI> they are imployed in gathering Mulberry Leaves to feed their Silk-worms. <HI>August, September,</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> are for gathering and drying their Currans, Figgs, Raisons, Valania, Perni∣coke Seed, and Tobacco; also for making their Wine and taking up their Honey and Wax.</P>
<P>Their Oyl they put into great Earthen Jarrs, which
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>are made of hard Clay, well baked in Furnaces, but not glazed, which therefore will not keep Water from soaking through them. These Jarrs are sent to <HI>Candy,</HI> and other places for Merchandize. To preserve their Cheese they sift Earth, mix it with Salt and Water, then with it Coat over the Cheese, which keeps it cool, but makes it very Salt. A great quantity of this Cheese is yearly carried to <HI>Venice:</HI> It serves the ordinary People, who sometimes grate it upon their boyl'd Macaroons, and Rice, instead of <HI>Parmisan.</HI></P>
<P>Though the <HI>Turks</HI> drink no Wine, yet they take New Wine and boyl it up to a Syrrup (which they call <HI>Bec∣mez,</HI> and we call <HI>Cute,</HI>) putting it into small Jarrs, they drink it mingled with Water, for this they account to be no Wine. They call new Wine <HI>Shira,</HI> and old Wine <HI>Shirab.</HI></P>
<P>Their Buildings are most of Bricks made of Clay, and chopt Straw, and dryed in the Sun. The Foun∣dations of the Walls are of Stone, and Lime. Few Houses are above two Story high; they are covered over with Pan Tiles. There are not many great Houses in all the <HI>Morea,</HI> the best being at <HI>Napoli, Misitha,</HI> and <HI>Corinth:</HI> Not above three deserve the Name of <HI>Seraglios</HI> (as they call Palaces.) Flesh and Fowl is plen∣tiful, but Fish is scarce. The Air is very temperate; there is seldome any Rain from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>August.</HI> The Winter is also very moderate, and lasteth not above two Months any thing Cold: There is seldome any Snow in the Plains</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>Description</HI> of the <HI>CITY</HI> of ATHENS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the Head City in the Province of <HI>Attica,</HI> and was once the greatest Mistress of Learning in all <HI>Europe.</HI> The Plain is about Sixteen Miles Long, and Five Broad, being surrounded with Mountains, all but towards the South, where it is washed by the <HI>Egean</HI> Sea. The Olive-trees stand so thick to the West of the City that they seem to be a Wood, reaching Six Miles in Length, and Two in Breadth. Whilst I was there, a <HI>Tahrirge</HI> (or Surveyor) came down from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to Survey the Place; he found above Fifty Thousand Olive-trees in this Plain, and other places about the City. There are several small Villages, where are very pleasant Gardens, which afford all sort of Fruit and Saleting, having Walks round them covered with Vines, of which there are two sorts; the one is in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language called <HI>Barmak Ʋzumi,</HI> a long White Grape; the other <HI>Hevengh Ʋzumi,</HI> a round Red Grape, both which growing in very large Bunches. Of the latter Mr. <HI>Vernon</HI> weighed one Bunch which was near Four Oaks (about Ten Pound <HI>English.</HI>) These Red Grapes are not ripe till <HI>September,</HI> then they cut them off, and hang them up in their Houses for Win∣ter store. Neither of these Two sorts grow in Vine∣yards. The Vine-yards are planted most betwixt the City, and the Sea. The City is now not above Three Miles about: Being Four Miles from <HI>Porto Lion,</HI> (which formerly was call <HI>Pirea</HI>) having a Castle to the South. The Houses are better built here than in any part of the <HI>Morea,</HI> most having little Courts, with high Walls,
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>in which are Arches with Marble Pillars; few Houses above Two Story high: They also patcht up with the Ruines of old Palaces, and in most Walls are abun∣dance of old Inscriptions. The Governors are in the same manner as they be in other Cities under the <HI>Turks.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> live much better here than in any other part of <HI>Turky,</HI> (<HI>Scio</HI> excepted) being a small Com∣mon-wealth amongst themselves. They choose eight Magistrates, who adjust all differences, and appear in all Publick Matters. Their Protector (at the Port) is the Grand Seigniors Chief Eunuch, who hath the disposing of that Government. The City is not Walled about, but has Gates at the Streets end, which every Night are shut, to keep out Privateers, who often Land and do much mischief. Here is an Arch-Bishop whose House stands to the South West of the Town, near unto the Mount <HI>Ariopagus:</HI> He lives in great esteem amongst them. Below his Palace towards the North, stands intire the Temple of <HI>Theseus,</HI> which is a fair and large Building, all of White Marble, having a Portico about it with Pillars. The Temple is Seventy Three Foot long, and Twenty Six in Breadth: The Length of the Portico (which goes round it,) is One Hundred Twenty Three Foot: It is now a <HI>Greek</HI> Church, and Dedicated to St. <HI>George.</HI> To the South East part of the Castle are Seventeen Marble Pillars, being the re∣mainder of One Hundred and Twenty, on which the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI> had his Palace: And upon some of the Pillars which stand towards the East, is to be seen part of the Foundation. These Pillars are of a pure White Marble, with blewish Waves, Schollop-work, being Fifty Foot in heighth, and Nineteen and a half round. The Ground is very even about them, which they say was formerly Paved with Marble. Close to these Pillars Eastward, is a square Piece of Ground, which is Walled in with a low Wall, being Green: It is
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>kept very smooth and free of Stones; at the South End close to the Wall, is a place (raised with Two Steps) about Two Foot high, almost in Form of a Throne. In the time of their <HI>Byram,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> come to this place, where their Emam or Priest (sitting on the raised place) Preacheth to them, shewing them the Vanity of the World, the Greatness of their Em∣perour, and the Valour of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces, conclu∣ding with a Prayer for the Grand Seignior, which is answered with Three Shouts from the Auditors, with a loud Voice crying, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>The Castle stands on a Rock, which is high and steep, having but one way up, and three Gates to pass through into the Body of it: The Walls are much out of re∣pair. The Scituation makes it strong. This Castle stood almost in the middle of Old <HI>Athens:</HI> The Place most worth Observation in it, is the Temple of <HI>Mi∣nerva,</HI> which remains entire, being esteemed (by all who have seen it) to be one of the Most Glorious Buildings in <HI>Europe.</HI> It is all pure White Marble: The Length of the Body of the Temple is One Hundred Sixty Eight <HI>English</HI> Feet, and the Breadth Seventy One: There are Seventeen Pillars at each Side, and Eight at the Front: The Circuit of the Pillars are Nineteen Foot and a Half: The Length of the whole Temple Two Hundred and Thirty Feet. The Temple is very dark, having only some Lights to the Eastward. The <HI>Greeks</HI> did Consecrate, and Dedicated it to the Blessed Virgin. Since that, the <HI>Turks</HI> have perverted it with their Worship. The <HI>Turks</HI> have White-wash'd the Inside, notwithstanding it is all of pure Marble. In and about <HI>Athens,</HI> are Two Hundred <HI>Greek</HI> Churches, (most of which have been Temples) but not one quar∣ter of them are now used. In the Plain and on most of the Hills, there are many small Chappels. The Ruines are above Six Miles about, of which the Reader
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>may have full satisfaction by reading the Travels of Sir <HI>George Wheeler,</HI> who hath given a large and true Account of this City. Some Geographers call it <HI>Set∣tines,</HI> which name was never known to the Inhabi∣tants; the <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Atinna,</HI> and the <HI>Greeks Athine.</HI> The Air is very good. The Soyl rich. It hath a River to the South, close by the Ruines of <HI>Adrians</HI> Palace, called <HI>Illisus</HI> or <HI>Calleroy;</HI> which is almost choaked up, and in Summer is dry. The Harbour of <HI>Porto Lione</HI> is very secure from the danger of any Wind, but there is no Fortification, so that it is frequented by Pyrats. In all the Villages and Country about <HI>Athens,</HI> the In∣habitants are most <HI>Albaneses;</HI> and they are here more populous than in the <HI>Morea.</HI> It affords the same Com∣modities: and all Provision is as reasonable, but their Wines in general are not so good.</P>

<HEAD>The Island of <HI>ZANT,</HI> formerly called <HI>ZACYNTHƲS,</HI></HEAD>
<P>Is under the <HI>Venetians,</HI> lying about 15 miles from the South West point of the <HI>Morea.</HI> The West part is all Mountains, and to the North East is another Mountain (called <HI>Scopo</HI>) between which it is very low land, so as from the Southward at Sea it appears to be two Islands. The chief Road hath the name of the Island. The Town stretcheth it self above a mile along that Bay; it is well built, with Free-stone, but the Houses are low, by rea∣son of the Earth-quakes, which are very frequent. To the West, over the Town, stands the Castle, on a high and steep Hill, and is a small City in it self: The Wall is above a mile about. The Governour is a Noble-man of <HI>Venice:</HI> There is an <HI>Italian</HI> Bishop, and three <HI>Italian</HI> Churches: But the <HI>Greeks</HI> (who are the chief Inhabi∣tants (have a <HI>Proto Papa,</HI> and all Festivals are observed ac∣cording to the old stile. In the Island is above 30 Villages, and more than 60000 Souls. The Corn which grows
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>here will not suffice above three months; but in time of Peace with the <HI>Turks,</HI> they are well supplied from the <HI>Morea,</HI> and in time of War Corn is brought from <HI>Apuglia,</HI> and other parts in the Gulph of <HI>Venice.</HI> One year with another it produceth near 10000 Tun of Wine, 200 Tun of Oyl, and 2000 Tun of Currants; and may be compared, for pleasantness and richness, with any Island (of its bigness) in the World. The Currants grow on Vines, and spread themselves on the ground like other Grapes: In <HI>July</HI> they gather them, and spread them on a very smooth part of ground, where they lye until they are well dry'd, then they fall off from the Stalks; so are carry'd and put into Ware∣houses, where they are kept till the Merchants buy them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>STRAFADA</HI> Islands.</HEAD>
<P>They are two small Islands which lye about 20 miles from <HI>Zant,</HI> and 30 from the <HI>Morea.</HI> On the bigger is a Monastery well built, which hath a high Tower: There is about 40 Priests of the Order of St. <HI>Basil.</HI> They work the ground, and have all sorts of Fruits and Sallating; but their supply of Bread, Oyl and Wine, is brought them from <HI>Zant,</HI> where they have possessions. They never eat Flesh. When any Pyrats come to molest them, they shut themselves up in the Tower of the Monastery. There is no Harbour for Ships, so as seldom any come to trouble them.</P>
