<HEAD>THE PREFACE to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING for the most part persued the very same <HI>Method</HI> in writing this <HI>History,</HI> that I used in that of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> I shall have little occasion further to enlarge my self here, than to acquaint the <HI>Reader</HI> with those few <HI>alterations</HI> he will find I have made, which I doubt not he will judg, so advantageous and reasonable, that he will easily approve of what I have done, and ex∣cuse me of all levity, and unsettledness of temper.</P>
<P>The first and cheifest of which <HI>alterations,</HI> he will meet with in the <HI>Map;</HI> where he will find many <HI>Letters,</HI> as well as <HI>figures</HI> set over the <HI>Sheilds,</HI> and these divided with lines drawn between them; the <HI>figures</HI> on the right hand each <HI>Escocheon,</HI> shewing what <HI>Armes</HI> belong to the <HI>Houses,</HI> as they did in <HI>Oxfordshire;</HI> and the <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>figures</HI> on the left hand division, shewing on the contrary what <HI>Houses,</HI> belong to each <HI>Armes:</HI> so that whereas in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> upon the sight of a <HI>house,</HI> one could easily find the <HI>Armes</HI> that be∣long'd to it; in this, upon sight of any mans <HI>Armes</HI> (which are easily met with, being all placed in <HI>alphabetical</HI> order) one may as quickly find the <HI>house</HI> belonging to them; by seeking the same <HI>Let∣ters</HI> and <HI>figures</HI> over the <HI>Armes,</HI> in the <HI>Western</HI> and <HI>Northern</HI> Limbs of the <HI>Map,</HI> and finding where they meet in a right angle: the <HI>houses</HI> (as well as <HI>parishes</HI> and <HI>villages,</HI> whereof there is an <HI>In∣dex</HI> also annext to this <HI>History</HI>) being always within or somewhere at lest touching the <HI>lines</HI> of the <HI>squares,</HI> wherever these <HI>Ltters</HI> and <HI>figures</HI> meet; that are set over, or after, those <HI>Armes,</HI> or <HI>parishes.</HI> So that the <HI>Reader</HI> hereby tho' never so great a stranger, may not only when he sees a <HI>Gentlemans</HI> seat with <HI>figures</HI> annext, quickly find whose' tis; but (which is of greater use) if he know but any persons <HI>name</HI> in the <HI>County,</HI> he shall as quickly find his <HI>Armes,</HI> and whereabout he lives; as he may also any <HI>Town, Parish,</HI> or <HI>village,</HI> if he read any thing remarkable in this <HI>History,</HI> found or done there, and would know whereabout it is situate in the <HI>County.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>distances,</HI> and <HI>Scale</HI> of <HI>Miles</HI> in the <HI>Map,</HI> they were taken after the same manner as in the <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and set off in the <HI>Map</HI> at the rate of two miles in an inch, as may be found upon comparison of a <HI>Rule</HI> with the <HI>Scale,</HI> and of the
<PB REF="4"/><HI>Scale</HI> with the <HI>squares,</HI> the mean or middle sort of reputed <HI>Miles</HI> of this <HI>County</HI> (which I have followed here as I did in <HI>Oxford∣shire</HI>) containing for the most part about <HI>10 furlongs,</HI> of which about <HI>55</HI> answer a <HI>degree,</HI> so that <HI>92/100</HI> parts of a <HI>mile</HI> or <HI>9/10</HI> and <HI>1/3</HI> make a <HI>minute;</HI> according to which computation the <HI>degrees</HI> of <HI>North Latitude</HI> are divided into <HI>minutes</HI> on each side the <HI>Map,</HI> be∣ing cheifly made off from the Latitude of <HI>Stafford,</HI> which hath been observed to be situat in the <HI>52<SUP>d</SUP> minute</HI> of the <HI>52<SUP>d</SUP> degree, proxime;</HI> the <HI>53<SUP>d</SUP> degree</HI> beginning at the <HI>line</HI> passing betwixt <HI>Knighton</HI> and <HI>Radwood</HI> on the West side of the <HI>Map,</HI> and so through <HI>Hanchurch, Trentham, Blurton, Huntley, Bradley,</HI> and <HI>Denston:</HI> by which di∣vision't is easy to know to a <HI>minute</HI> of a <HI>degree,</HI> nay almost to a <HI>se∣cond,</HI> in what latitude every <HI>Town, Parish, Village,</HI> and <HI>Gentle∣mans house,</HI> is seated.</P>
<P>Which is all wherein the <HI>Map</HI> differs from the former: and as for the <HI>History</HI> it self, I have so little reason to repent me of the <HI>Method</HI> I follow'd in that of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> that I hope it differs not from it at all; unless in case of <HI>meliority,</HI> viz. in a greater variety of parallel <HI>Histories,</HI> whereby the more unusual ones, I met with in this <HI>County,</HI> have been all along confirm'd; and in the determination of more dif∣ficult <HI>Questions;</HI> whereby there is scarce a <HI>Chapter</HI> in this <HI>History</HI> but has been render'd the more considerable, I mean in the <HI>stating</HI> of some one, or more of them: which I hope all men will find done with that accuracy, that they will accept of them in excuse of the long delay, that has partly been made upon that account, in the publishing this <HI>History;</HI> it having been really so far from a preju∣dice, that I think I can satisfy any reasonable man, that this <HI>Hi∣story</HI> could not have possibly been, what (I hope) it is, in a much less time.</P>
<P>I know 'twill be objected I publish't it in print, that this <HI>History</HI> should be exstant by such a time precisely, now long since past; which I here as publicly deny, as ever it 'twas asserted: for the truth whereof I appeal to the very papers subscribed by the hands of the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry,</HI> who encouraged the <HI>work,</HI> and if it be found otherwise then is here profess't, let me never enjoy the benefit of them; nor of any thing there mention'd, if I doe not litterally and with advantage, make all good I there promised: which I hope is as much as will be expected of me, by any judicious unprejudiced persons, and for others, I am not concern'd to give them satisfaction.</P>

<HEAD><HI>DIRECTIONS</HI> For a right understanding of the <HI>Map.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Let the <HI>Reader</HI> take notice that the <HI>Armes</HI> of the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry,</HI> and the <HI>fgures</HI> over the right hand of each <HI>Sheild,</HI> are put according to the <HI>Alphabetical</HI> order of the <HI>names,</HI> and <HI>numeral</HI> order of the <HI>figu∣res,</HI> except when the Persons live in <HI>Lichfield</HI> or <HI>Stafford,</HI> in which case, those of <HI>Lichfield</HI> are markt with an *, and those of <HI>Stafford</HI> with <FIGURE REND="inline">
<FIGDESC>quartered square</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Armes</HI> on the top of the <HI>Map</HI> are to be reckoned first; those on the right hand next; those on the left hand in the third place; those on the bottom last.</P>
<P N="3">3. That every <HI>Nobleman</HI> and <HI>Gentlemans</HI> Seat in the <HI>Country</HI> has a certain number annext to it, which being easily found by the numeral order of the <HI>figures</HI> over the right hand division of some <HI>Sheild</HI> of <HI>Armes</HI> in the <HI>Limb</HI> of the <HI>Map,</HI> shews the <HI>Armes</HI> of the <HI>Person</HI> whose <HI>Seat</HI> it is, with his name &amp; quality under them.</P>
<P N="4">4. That as the <HI>figures</HI> over the right hand of the <HI>Escocheons</HI> shew what <HI>Armes</HI> belong to the <HI>Houses:</HI> So the <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>figures</HI> over the left hand division shew what <HI>Houses</HI> belong to the <HI>Armes,</HI> by finding the same <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>figures</HI> near the <HI>Western</HI> and <HI>Northern Limbs</HI> of the <HI>Map,</HI> and where they meet in a <HI>right angle;</HI> The <HI>Houses</HI> (as well as <HI>Parishes</HI> and <HI>Villages</HI> above mention'd) being always within, or somewhere touching the lines of the <HI>square</HI> where these <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>figures</HI> meet, that are set over or after those <HI>Armes</HI> or <HI>Parishes.</HI> So that wherever the <HI>Reader</HI> (tho' never so great a <HI>stranger</HI>) sees a <HI>house</HI> with <HI>figures</HI> annext, he can quickly find whose 'tis: Or if he know but any persons <HI>name</HI> in the <HI>County,</HI> he shall as quickly find his <HI>Armes,</HI> and whereabout in the <HI>County</HI> his house is situate.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Heavens and Air.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1.<SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING already in the Introduction to my <HI>Natural History</HI> of <HI>Oxford-shire</HI> prescribed my self a <HI>Method,</HI> whereof I have no reason to repent me<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nat. Hist. of Oxford-sh.</HI> Chap. 1. §. §. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>, I shall forbear all further <HI>Preface</HI> to this, than to acquaint the <HI>Reader</HI> in short, that I intend the same again, not only in the <HI>Whole,</HI> but in the particular <HI>Chapters;</HI> and that I shall make all <HI>Relations</HI> (as formerly) in a plain familiar Stile, without the Ornaments of <HI>Rhetorick,</HI> least the matter be obscured by too much <HI>illustration;</HI> and with all the imaginable brevity that <HI>perspicuity</HI> will bear; it being an indisputable truth, that an <HI>Author</HI> by enlargeing to the utmost compass of his <HI>Theme,</HI> some∣times advances his <HI>Papers</HI> to so disproportionable a Bulk, that by writing too much, He had almost as good have writ nothing, Experience convincing us that <HI>voluminous Works</HI> have but few <HI>Buyers,</HI> and much fewer <HI>Readers.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="12"/>2. Upon this account too, I have industriously set my self this irrepealable Law, to remain inviolable in all other <HI>Histories</HI> I shall write of this kind: That whatever I meet with in one <HI>County,</HI> already described in another, shall be only just men∣tioned as found, seen, or heard of, at such or such a place, al∣ways referring the <HI>Reader</HI> for the Description, or Philosophi∣cal account of it, to the former <HI>Book;</HI> unless the thing differ in some considerable circumstance, or be but imperfectly de∣scribed: thus whatever Curiosity either of <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Art</HI> (be it of the greatest moment) that I have met with in <HI>Stafford-shire,</HI> if sufficiently described already in <HI>Oxford-shire,</HI> shall be but barely mention'd here, reference being made to the <HI>Chapter</HI> and <HI>Section</HI> of that <HI>History,</HI> where it has been discoursed on be∣fore: Nor need I doubt but the <HI>Stafford-shire Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gen∣try</HI> (Learning and Ingenuity being so frequent amongst them) will allow me this privilege, without the least imputation of detracting from their Country, since hereby I avoid all vain re∣petitions, and yet shall amply repay them again, if I live to write the <HI>History</HI> of any other <HI>County,</HI> by referring in like man∣ner as much or more to theirs; which 'tis manifold odds, but I shall certainly do, if I ever meet hereafter with the like <HI>noble encouragement,</HI> that they have so plentifully and generously af∣forded me.</P>
<P N="3">3. To come then forthwith to the <HI>subject</HI> in hand, the <HI>Na∣tural History</HI> of the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Stafford;</HI> the first thing I met with relating to the <HI>Heavens,</HI> and one of the first too that I heard of after I set to work in earnest, was a pretty <HI>rural observation,</HI> of late years made by some of the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of the Town of <HI>Leek</HI> in the <HI>Moorelands,</HI> of the setting of the <HI>Sun</HI> in the Summer <HI>Sol∣stice,</HI> near a Hill called the <HI>Cloud,</HI> about six miles distant, in the confines of <HI>Stafford-shire</HI> and <HI>Cheshire;</HI> which appearing almost perpendicular on the <HI>Northern</HI> side, to such persons as are stand∣ing in <HI>Leek</HI> Church-yard, the <HI>Sun</HI> seems so nicely at that time of year to cut the Edg of it at setting, as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 1. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. that not∣withstanding what is taught by <HI>Astronomers,</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> whilst it occupies that <HI>Cardinal</HI> point, appears <HI>Stationary</HI> for some time without giving any sensible increase or decrease to the length of the days; they can plainly perceive by the help of this <HI>Hill,</HI> that no two days are equal, but that there is a sensible difference eve∣ry day: just as at the Temple of <HI>Tentiris</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> where there are as many Windows as days in the year, so placed, that the <HI>Sun</HI> rising in a different degree of the <HI>Zodiac</HI> every day, it also sends in its beams every day into a distinct Window from the day before<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>H. Vanslebius</HI>'s present State of <HI>Egypt</HI> chap. <HI>ult. p.</HI> 246.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="12"/>For when the <HI>Sun</HI> comes near the <HI>Solstice,</HI> the whole disk of it at first sets behind the <HI>Hill,</HI> after a while the <HI>Northern Limb</HI> first appears, and so every night gradually more, till at length the whole <HI>Diameter</HI> comes to set <HI>Northward</HI> of it, for about three nights; but the middle night of the three, very sensibly more re∣mote, than the former or the following, when beginning its re∣cess from the <HI>Tropic,</HI> it still continues more and more to be hid∣den every night, till at length it descends quite behind it a∣gain.</P>
<P N="4">4. Which <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> though worth notice for its own sake alone, yet might be render'd of much more use to the <HI>Publick,</HI> would the <HI>Curious</HI> that for the most part reside thereabout, make <HI>annual</HI> and more strict observations for the future by suitable <HI>In∣struments,</HI> noteing every year the day precisely, that the <HI>Limb</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> first cuts the edge of the <HI>Hill,</HI> and how many <HI>Digits</HI> or parts of <HI>Digits,</HI> of its own <HI>Diameter,</HI> it daily advances; also carefully noteing the nearest distance 'twixt the edge of the <HI>Hill,</HI> and the <HI>Rim</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> on the very day of the <HI>Solstice,</HI> and last∣ly the <HI>Mean</HI> between both: For by this means in time the <HI>Suns</HI> greatest <HI>Northern Declination</HI> (which <HI>Astronomers</HI> say is less now than heretofore<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Joh. Bapt. Riccioli Almagestum Nov. <HI>Lib. 3. Chap. 27.</HI></NOTE>) may be gradually adjusted, and at length per∣haps limited; Which I take to be an <HI>Experiment</HI> of so valuable a Consideration, that I cannot but recommend it to my worthy friends the Worshipful <HI>Thomas Rudyerd</HI> of <HI>Rudyerd</HI> Esquire, M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Parker,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Thomas Gent;</HI> at least that they would take care in some one year or other, when there is least of <HI>Refraction</HI> up∣on account of the <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> from some fixt point, so to adjust the distance betwixt the <HI>Hill</HI> and the <HI>Sun</HI> on the day of the <HI>Sol∣stice</HI> by an <HI>Azimuthal Quadrant,</HI> the new <HI>Micrometer,</HI> or some other agreeable Instrument, that future <HI>Ages</HI> however (if it cannot be in this) may see the difference.</P>
<P N="5">5. Next the true and genuine, the Spurious or <HI>Mock-Suns</HI> that have been frequent in this <HI>County</HI> fall under consideration, so frequent indeed (their causes already having been hinted in <HI>Ox∣ford-shire</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Nat. Hist. of Oxford-sh. <HI>Chap. 1.</HI> §. <HI>5.</HI></NOTE>) that they scarce deserve any; at most but bare men∣tioning: Such were the <HI>Parelia</HI> seen about twenty years since, by that great Example of <HI>Valour</HI> and <HI>Fidelity</HI> to his Prince, the Worshipful <HI>Collonel John Lane</HI> and Mr. <HI>Persehowse</HI> of <HI>Nether Gournall;</HI> as they were walking between <HI>Bentley</HI> and <HI>Willings∣worth</HI> (near <HI>Darlaston</HI>) they appear'd in the <HI>West,</HI> the <HI>Sun</HI> not above half an hour high standing in a line <HI>parallel</HI> to the <HI>Horizon;</HI> and so did the <HI>Mock-Sun</HI> seen <HI>July</HI> 12. 1678. by the virtuous,
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>learned, and most ingenious <HI>Gentleman</HI> the Worshipful <HI>Walter Chetwynd</HI> of <HI>Ingestre</HI> Esquire, and Mr. <HI>Fisher Dilke</HI> as they were walking on <HI>Hopton</HI> Heath. I was also informed by the same in∣genious <HI>Gentleman</HI> Mr. <HI>Fisher Dilke</HI> that on <HI>August</HI> the 28. 1679. He saw much such another at or near <HI>Haselour,</HI> neither of them having any Circle of light about them, or passing through the <HI>Disks</HI> of <HI>Mock</HI> or true <HI>Sun,</HI> as is usual, and both of them of so strong and even a light, as hard to be distinguished from the true <HI>Sun;</HI> only differing in this, that the first <HI>Mock-Sun</HI> ap∣pear'd about ten degrees to the <HI>South</HI> of the true one, and the latter to the <HI>North,</HI> but both of them in <HI>Almicantars</HI> or lines pa∣rallel to the <HI>Horizon.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. And thus it seems they generally do, <HI>nec supra ipsum nec in∣fra,</HI> says <HI>Pliny, sed ex obliquo,</HI> neither above nor beneath the true <HI>Sun,</HI> but on either side; <HI>nec noctu, sed aut Oriente aut Occidente</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nat. Hist.</HI> Lib. 2. Chap. 31.</NOTE>, nor in the night season, but when the <HI>Sun</HI> either riseth or setteth, only once indeed he says in the same <HI>Chapter,</HI> that such were reported to have been seen at <HI>noon day</HI> in <HI>Bosphoro</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>; and we are informed by the learned <HI>Monsieur Hevelius</HI> that near <HI>Marien∣burg</HI> in <HI>Borussia Feb.</HI> 5.1674. He saw in the Evening the true <HI>Sun</HI> sending forth very long reddish rays tapering gradually up∣ward for 40 or 50 degrees toward the <HI>Zenith,</HI> and under it a <HI>Mock-Sun</HI> nearer to the <HI>Horizon</HI> of the same bigness (to sense) with the true one, and in the same <HI>Vertical</HI> or <HI>Azimuth</HI> line<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Philos. Transact. <HI>Numb. 102. p. 26</HI> how this may be, see Des Cartes Meteororum <HI>Lib. 10.</HI> §. <HI>5.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="7">7. Which though instances amongst <HI>Authors</HI> so very rare, that we hear of but these two, now in sixteen hundred years, yet one of them seems to have happened so very lately as <HI>Dec.</HI> 4. 1680. and to have been carefully observed, by my worthy, learned, and most ingenious friend, the Worshipful <HI>Francis Wol∣ferstan</HI> of <HI>Statfold</HI> Esquire, who riding between his own house and <HI>Clifton Campvill,</HI> as near as he could guess about twelve at noon, His <HI>Man</HI> first espyed somewhat unusual in the <HI>Heavens,</HI> which not without amazement quickly shewing to his <HI>Master,</HI> He presently perceived about the <HI>Azimuth</HI> or hour line of two (<HI>viz.</HI> two hours before the <HI>Sun</HI> or thereabout) a more than ordinary <HI>brightness</HI> of the same altitude with the <HI>Sun,</HI> which through the tenuious clouds that were passing over it, appear'd for a while not unlike another <HI>Sun,</HI> the true <HI>Sun</HI> shining at the same time.</P>
<P N="8">8. But immediately after (the clouds passing away) there appeared in the same place the usual colours of the <HI>Solar Rain∣bow,</HI> somewhat of an <HI>oval</HI> form, with smaller beams issuing from
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>each side, and a larger white ray or stream of light darting downward from the bottom, as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 1. <HI>fig.</HI> 2. most remark∣ably differing from the <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> of <HI>Hevelius,</HI> the ray of light in his issuing from the true <HI>Sun</HI> and tending upward, this from the <HI>Mock-Sun</HI> (for I can call it no less) and tending down∣ward: Its colours whilst it continued in that form were strong and beautiful, but languishing by degrees, it became at length a small portion or <HI>Segment</HI> of a <HI>Solar Iris</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 1. <HI>fig.</HI> 3. which because so notoriously imperfect, and thus irregularly posited in the Heavens, may deserve perhaps as much or more of our admiration, as was given the imperfect <HI>Iris</HI> drawn by the great Master <HI>Aristides</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">C. Plin. 2<SUP>di</SUP>. Nat. Hist. <HI>Lib. 35. Cap. 11.</HI></NOTE>, beyond what would have been afforded to the most perfect one he could have painted: not only because appearing in the <HI>South</HI> contrary to the known rule amongst the <HI>Meteorologists, nullae ad Austrum pinguntur Irides,</HI> but for overthrowing in a manner the whole <HI>doctrine</HI> of <HI>Rainbows.</HI> As first that the <HI>Center</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> and the <HI>Eye</HI> of the <HI>Beholder,</HI> must be in one right line; secondly the <HI>Spectator</HI> be∣tween the <HI>Sun</HI> and the <HI>Rainbow;</HI> and thirdly the <HI>horns</HI> or <HI>shanks</HI> of the <HI>Bow</HI> always terminating in the <HI>Horizon:</HI> whereas this, being but 30 degrees from the <HI>Sun,</HI> the <HI>Concave</HI> toward it, and the <HI>Con∣vex</HI> Westward from it, and consequentially the <HI>Cornua</HI> one above another in the same <HI>Vertical,</HI> can be no way agreeable to any such <HI>Axioms.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Nor yet was this <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> so very irregular, but that somwhat of this kind seems to have happen'd before, for says <HI>For∣tunius Licetus, bis jam vidimus Irides in Meridiano ad Austrum,</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Fort. Licet. de novis Astric &amp; Cometis, <HI>Lib. 6. cap. 2.</HI></NOTE> that He had twice seen <HI>Rainbowes</HI> in the <HI>South;</HI> And <HI>Cornelius Gemma</HI> acquaints us that on the 25 of <HI>September</HI> in the morning <HI>Anno</HI> 1560. He saw a <HI>Rainbow</HI> of a like in the <HI>whole,</HI> though quite contrary position to ours in the <HI>parts, Stabat enim convexa parte Solem versus, concava vero versus cujusdam Parhelli subobscu∣rum typum, qui quasi ad Circium annuebat</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Corn. Gemm. Cosmocrit.</HI> Lib. 2 cap. 1.</NOTE><HI>Cornua igitur,</HI> says <HI>Fro∣mondus, non in Terram spectabant, sed aversa ab exoriente Sole, di∣recte in Occidentem intendebantur</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.

<P N="10">10.

<P N="11">11. And such a large <HI>Halo</HI> as one of these it was, that was seen about the <HI>Sun May</HI> 17. 1681. at <HI>Edingall</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> by the above mention'd curious and observing Gent. the Wor∣shipful <HI>Francis Wolferstan</HI> Esquire, and many others, having the lively colours of the <HI>Solar Rainbow,</HI> and extending its <HI>Diameter</HI> as near as he could guess (for he had no <HI>Instrument</HI> with him) about 40. degrees; which yet was not so remarkable in these
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>respects, as for the unusual form it appear'd in, for though the <HI>colours</HI> were apparent in all the parts, yet the <HI>Circle</HI> was not every where (as commonly they are) equally broad, but nar∣rower on each side to the East and West, and much broader above and below the <HI>Sun,</HI> toward the <HI>Zenith</HI> and <HI>Horizon</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 1. <HI>fig.</HI> 4. And in this form it moved along with the <HI>Sun</HI> from half an hour past <HI>ten</HI> in the Morning, to as much past <HI>one</HI> in the Afternoon: what should occasion this <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> indeed is hard to determine, yet certainly it must arise from some pe∣culiar position of a <HI>rorid</HI> cloud or vapor, whose parts were made up of small threds (as 'tis also in <HI>Parelia's</HI> and <HI>Rainbows</HI>) having the figure of equilateral triangular <HI>Prismes</HI> which cause the colours, that must accompany the <HI>Sun</HI> for all that time; for should it be ascribed to the <HI>Sun</HI> it self, we should certainly before now have heard of others of the kind: I know it is the opinion of the ancient <HI>Philosophers,</HI> that the motion of this <HI>Me∣teor</HI> is not true but apparent, <HI>i. e.</HI> that the same <HI>Halo</HI> does not continue, but that a new one is still generated, as the <HI>Sun</HI> holds on its course<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.

<P N="12">12. But that which seems to put all out of doubt, on the <HI>Tuesday</HI> sevenight following <HI>May</HI> 24. being <HI>Whitsun-Tuesday,</HI> ei∣ther the same, or another of the like kind, was seen again by the same worthy person, which appeared also for several days in the following week, and was seen not only in <HI>Stafford-shire,</HI> but at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Rochester</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> by my worthy friend <HI>Robert Conny</HI> M. B. of <HI>Magd. Coll. Oxon.</HI> Whence it plainly appears probable, not only that the same <HI>Cloud</HI> did accompany the <HI>Sun</HI> for some time at least; but also that notwithstanding the ancient <HI>Philo∣sophers,</HI> have restrain'd the <HI>Clouds</HI> to the <HI>middle Region, viz.</HI> that they never transcend the tops of <HI>Mountains,</HI> yet they are some∣times mounted much higher, being strongly attracted by the <HI>Rays</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and then easily upheld, and thus carryed about with it for some considerable time; for otherwise how could such a <HI>Halo</HI> be seen at so far distant places as <HI>Stafford-shire</HI> and <HI>Kent,</HI> at the same time.</P>

Next to these <HI>impressions</HI> made in the <HI>clouds,</HI> I descend to others made from them, such as the amazing and sometimes de∣plorable effects of <HI>Thunder</HI> and <HI>Lightening,</HI> which though they most commonly happen together, yet because the <HI>Lightening</HI> first affects the Sense, I give it the precedence as is usual amongst <HI>Na∣turalists.</HI> That <HI>Lightening</HI> should happen in the <HI>VVinter-quarter</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>has been always accounted a great rarity; yet not only this, but a more unusual accident (perhaps not to be met again in many <HI>Ages</HI>) was shewed me at <HI>Statfold,</HI> by the foremention'd worthy <HI>Gentleman</HI> the Worshipful <HI>Francis Wolferstan</HI> Esquire, who having built a new <HI>Gate</HI> before his house <HI>Anno</HI> 1675. and placed fair <HI>Globes</HI> of the finest and firmest stone over the <HI>Peers</HI> of it (where∣on He depicted with his own hand two <HI>Globe Dials</HI> in oyl co∣lours, and on the <HI>terrestrial</HI> the several <HI>Empires</HI> and <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of the <HI>VVorld,</HI> that He might see how day and night succeeded in each of them) in <HI>January</HI> 1677. had them both struck with <HI>lightening</HI> in the same <HI>point</HI> (where the <HI>great Meridian</HI> of the <HI>VVorld,</HI> and the <HI>North</HI> part of the <HI>Polar circle</HI> meet) there appear∣ing first a little <HI>hole</HI> just in that <HI>place,</HI> and <HI>cracks</HI> radiating from it to all parts on that side, and the <HI>stone</HI> it self swelling forth so far as the <HI>cracks</HI> went, and quickly after dropping from the rest of the <HI>Globes</HI> (the parts coming away being as soft and as much dis∣joyned as moist <HI>Sand</HI>) as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 1. <HI>Fig.</HI> 5.</P>

Nor is their difference only in the extent of their <HI>Diame∣ters,</HI> they varying also in divers other respects, though not pro∣portionably so much: for I have always observed that the <HI>Rims</HI> of these <HI>Circles,</HI> from the least to the bigest, are seldom narrower than a <HI>foot,</HI> or much broader then a <HI>yard;</HI> some as bare as a path way in many parts of them, others of a <HI>russet</HI> singed colour (both of these having a <HI>greener</HI> grass in the middle) and a third sort of a <HI>dark fresh green,</HI> the grass within being of a <HI>browner</HI> co∣lour; the first kind seldom less than five or six yards <HI>Diameter,</HI> and the other two of various <HI>Magnitudes;</HI> And all these parts of a <HI>Circle,</HI> others being <HI>Semicircular;</HI> some of them <HI>Quadrants,</HI> and others not above <HI>Sextants</HI> of their respective <HI>Circles.</HI></P>

<P N="21">21 But to come close to the business, let us return again to the forecited <HI>Remigius,</HI> who was a <HI>Judg</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and perhaps the best skill'd in matters of this nature that the <HI>world</HI> has yet known (having had the Examinations, Confessions and Condemnations of no less than nine hundred <HI>Wizards</HI> and <HI>Witches</HI> in fifteen years time) who, to omit many others of the like kind, gives us a most remarkable relation of such a <HI>Conventicle,</HI> and no less suitable (if true) to our present purpose.

<P N="27">27. For my part though my faith be but weak in this matter, (notwithstanding it cannot be deny'd but the bad as well as good Angels may be Ministring spirits and converse with Mankind) yet if I must needs allow them to cause some few of these <HI>Rings,</HI> I must also restrain them to those of the <HI>first</HI> kind, that are bare at many places like a <HI>path-way;</HI> for to both the others more <HI>natural causes</HI> may be probably assigned: As first according to the opini∣on of the ingenious Mr. <HI>Lister,</HI> that at least some of them may be occasioned by the working of <HI>Moldwarps,</HI> which however for the most part irregular they may be, yet may have a time when per∣haps by instinct of nature they may work in <HI>Circles;</HI> as 'tis certain <HI>fallow Deer</HI> do in the time of <HI>Rutting,</HI> treading the same <HI>Ring</HI> for many days together: indeed the strange fertility of these green <HI>Circles,</HI> even upon the most barren Heaths, beyond any place else about them, doth argue some extraordinary dung or compost, which he supposes to be the Excrements of <HI>Moles,</HI> or <HI>Moldwarps:</HI> others have fetcht their Origin from the <HI>dung</HI> and <HI>urin</HI> of <HI>Cattle</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>fed in winter time at the same <HI>pout</HI> of hay, for their heads meeting at the <HI>Hay</HI> as the <HI>center,</HI> and their bodies representing as it were so many <HI>radii,</HI> has made some imagin that such <HI>Circles</HI> are describ∣ed by their <HI>dung</HI> and <HI>urin</HI> falling always from them in due di∣stance, and <HI>fertilizing</HI> the ground in a more than ordinary manner by the largeness of the quantity. Others again have thought them described by the <HI>water</HI> and some of the <HI>Hay</HI> it self, falling plentifully in wet weather from the <HI>Eaves</HI> of round <HI>hay-stacks,</HI> that have been situate within them, which rotting into dung thus fer∣tilizes the Earth in a <HI>circular</HI> manner; and indeed 'tis possible that some of them may be made either of these ways.</P>
<P N="28">28. But for the <HI>Circles</HI> mentioned §. 17. of this <HI>Chapter</HI> of 30, 40, and 50 yards <HI>Diameter</HI> (too too large for the situation of any <HI>Hay-rick,</HI> or to be described by <HI>Cattle</HI> feeding at a <HI>hay-pout</HI>) and some of them running through <HI>hedge</HI> and <HI>ditch</HI> as shall be shewn in fit place, we must seek for other <HI>causes:</HI> In order whereunto (having good opportunity in <HI>New-Parks</HI> near the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> where there is always plenty of them) I thought fit to examin the nature of the <HI>Soile</HI> under the <HI>Rims</HI> of them, especially how it dif∣ferd from the adjoyning <HI>earth,</HI> and found by digging up several, that the ground under all of them, was much <HI>looser</HI> and <HI>dryer</HI> than ordinary, and the parts interspersed with a white <HI>hoar</HI> or <HI>vinew</HI> much like that in <HI>mouldy</HI> bread, of a musty rancid smell, but to tast insipid, and this scarce any where above six inches deep, the <HI>earth</HI> again below being of its due consistence and genuin smell, a∣greeable to the rest of the <HI>soils</HI> thereabout.</P>
<P N="29">29. Whence it being equally plain that I was no longer to en∣quire for the <HI>origin</HI> at least of these <HI>larger Circles,</HI> either from any thing under or upon the ground; it remained that I should look for some <HI>higher principle,</HI> and indeed after a long and mature de∣liberation, I could think of none nearer than the <HI>middle region; viz.</HI> that they must needs be the effects of <HI>Lightning,</HI> exploded from the <HI>Clouds</HI> most times in a <HI>circular</HI> manner; perhaps for this very reason by the <HI>ancient Naturalists</HI> called <HI>fulmen discutiens:</HI> which though of a viscous sulphureous consistence, yet taking fire and violently breaking the <HI>Cloud</HI> wherein it was pent, must natu∣rally expand it self every way <HI>obliquely,</HI> for the most part in a uni∣form <HI>conical</HI> manner so as at due distance to become a <HI>Circle</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 1. <HI>Fig.</HI> 6. and in that <HI>forme</HI> to strike the <HI>Earth</HI> as may be seen sometimes in <HI>arable grounds,</HI> but chiefly in wide and open <HI>pastures,</HI> whether <HI>Meddows</HI> or <HI>Ʋplands,</HI> where <HI>Trees</HI> and <HI>Hedges</HI> interrupt least.</P>
<P N="30">30. And not only in a <HI>single,</HI> but sometimes in a <HI>double</HI> and <HI>treble Circle</HI> one within another, as was lately shewn me by my
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>Worthy and Ingenious friend <HI>John Priaulx M. A.</HI> of <HI>Ʋniversity Colledge</HI> in the field between St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Church near <HI>Oxon</HI> and the <HI>garden</HI> called <HI>Jericho:</HI> They are rarely also seen of a <HI>quadrangular</HI> forme, encompassed with another larger of the <HI>Circular</HI> kind, as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 1. <HI>Fig.</HI> 7. whereof there were shewn me no less than <HI>two ex∣amples</HI> by my Ingenious and observing friends <HI>John Naylor</HI> and <HI>Hugh Todd M. M. A.

All these <HI>Rings</HI> and <HI>Squares</HI> being greater or less in proportion to the di∣stance of the <HI>Cloud</HI> from the <HI>Earth,</HI> and tenaciousness of the mat∣ter, and all appearing at first of a <HI>russet</HI> colour, the grass just then being singed with the <HI>Lightening;</HI> but the year following of a <HI>dark luxuriant green,</HI> the earth underneath having been highly im∣proved with a fat sulphureous matter (received from the <HI>Lighten∣ing</HI>) ever since it was first striken, though not exerting its fertiliz∣ing quality till some time after.</P>
<P N="31">31. Yet we must not esteem this improvement by <HI>Lightening</HI> to be so <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>genuin,</HI> as what is made by our ordinary <HI>Compost,</HI> for these only stimulat the principles of <HI>vegetation,</HI> whereas in this case the bonds of the <HI>natural mixtion</HI> seem to be dissolved, the parts of the body opened, and the true <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>vegetation</HI> flying away, the <HI>Salt</HI> also and <HI>Sulphur</HI> (having lost the <HI>spirit</HI> which was their common <HI>vinculum,</HI> and preserved the <HI>temperament</HI>) endeavour a divorce, get into exaltation, and joyning with the adventitious <HI>sulphur</HI> of the <HI>Lightening,</HI> seem unnaturally to enforce this <HI>luxuri∣ant vegetation,</HI> leaving behind them in the dry effete earth, that hoary white substance, of a musty soure smell, which I take to be the <HI>faeces</HI> of both <HI>sulphurs;</HI> in which opinion I am the rather con∣firm'd for that the <HI>Cattle</HI> which feed in these <HI>pastures,</HI> unless driven to it by extream <HI>drought,</HI> will never touch this <HI>rank</HI> sort of grass, it not having the genuin tast of the rest.</P>
<P N="32">32 And hence it is that so many <HI>Borasco's,</HI> or stormes of <HI>Thun∣der</HI> and <HI>Lightening</HI> have such effects upon <HI>liquors,</HI> as to make them <HI>stink</HI> and acquire a <HI>soureness viz.</HI> by opening the bodies of them, and leting flye that <HI>spirit</HI> that before secured the <HI>temperament,</HI> by restraining the <HI>Sulphur;</HI> which being also of a volatil nature and the principle of <HI>odours,</HI> geting into exaltation (in this dissolution or rather corruption of the <HI>Compositum</HI>) endeavours the like divorce and causes the <HI>stink;</HI> as the <HI>Salt</HI> in like manner freed from the
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>bonds of the <HI>Sulphur,</HI> gets at length the dominion and causes the <HI>sourness;</HI> which no question they likewise did under the <HI>Rims</HI> of these <HI>Circles,</HI> for having kept some of this <HI>earth</HI> by me but a natural day, it smelt just like the soure tappings of dead beer in a <HI>Cellar.</HI></P>
<P N="33">33. Yet that this is the true <HI>Philosophical</HI> account of them, I will not be so confident as firmly to pronounce; but for the mat∣ter of fact that they are caused by <HI>Lightening,</HI> I take it to be most certain, haveing not only observed them my selfe after <HI>Thunder</HI> and <HI>Lightening</HI> to be first <HI>russet</HI> and afterwards of a <HI>dark luxuriant green;</HI> but received it also from divers other sober persons of in∣disputable credit: more especially we may relye on the faithful testimony of one Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> a man eminent not only for his skill in <HI>Geometry</HI> but in all other <HI>accomplishments,</HI> who by chance one day walking in a <HI>Meddow</HI> amongst <HI>Mowers</HI> (with whom he had been but a little before) after such a storme of <HI>Lightening</HI> present∣ly espyed one of these <HI>Rings</HI> about five yards <HI>diameter,</HI> the <HI>Rim</HI> whereof was about a foot broad, newly burnt bare as the colour and brittleness of the grass roots did plainly testify, which the year following came more fresh and <HI>verdant</HI> in the place burnt, than in the middle, and at mowing time was much taller and rank∣er grass than any in the <HI>Meddow</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Communicated in a Letter from the ingenious Mr. <HI>Jessop</HI> of <HI>Broom-hall</HI> in <HI>York-shire,</HI> to my Learned and Ingenious Freind <HI>Martin Lister</HI> Physician at <HI>York,</HI> Philosoph.

<P N="34">34. If it be objected; that if <HI>Lightening</HI> causes these <HI>Circles,</HI> it must also be allowed that it descends <HI>vertically;</HI> which we know to be seldom or never seen. And that secondly if their <HI>origin</HI> be ascribed to <HI>Lightening,</HI> they must always remain of the <HI>same</HI> mag∣nitude, never enlargeing themselves to a <HI>greater diameter</HI> than they had at first; which yet we cannot but acknowledge some of them certainly doe; having not only took notice of the thing my self, but had it from others of unquestionable fidelity, that remarked the same in two of the <HI>Circles</HI> mention'd §. 17. of this <HI>Chapter:</HI> That at <HI>Handsworth</HI> having been observed for divers years by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Ange Rector</HI> of the place, who seriously told me that when he first knew it, it exceeded not 4. yards <HI>diameter</HI> at most, whereas when I measured it <HI>Anno</HI> 1680. it was increased almost to 40. haveing run through the <HI>hedg</HI> into another field: As that other at <HI>Pury-Hall,</HI> being in a field near the <HI>River</HI> (as I was in∣formed by the aforementioned Sr. <HI>Henry Gough</HI>) so increased from a <HI>smaller</HI> to a <HI>larger</HI> extent, till at length it came to be of near 50. yards <HI>diameter,</HI> and to run into the <HI>water.</HI> If I say these mat∣ters be objected,</P>
<P N="35">35. It must be answered first, that though it be true, that
<PB N="18" REF="20"/><HI>Lightening</HI> indeed seldom descends <HI>vertically,</HI> yet that it is as sel∣dom found too that any of these <HI>Rings</HI> are <HI>Mathematically</HI> round, (unless they happen to be on Hils or Banks sides, which may be ob∣verted in right Angels to any point of the Heavens between the <HI>Zenith</HI> and <HI>Horizon</HI>) most of them being rather of a <HI>parabolical</HI> figure, coming so much the nearer to a round, or receding farther from it, in proportion as the <HI>Lightening</HI> comes forth nearer or more remote from the <HI>Zenith:</HI> whence also it comes to pass that when <HI>Lightening</HI> is exploded (as most frequently it is) in an ob∣lique Line, these <HI>Circles</HI> are imperfect, and that there are more <HI>Se∣micircles, Quadrants,</HI> and <HI>Sextants</HI> amongst them, than any other, according to the aforesaid proportion as the <HI>Lightening</HI> breaks forth of a <HI>Cloud</HI> more remote from the <HI>Zenith,</HI> or nearer to the <HI>Ho∣rizon;</HI> thus if it proceed from a <HI>Cloud</HI> not above 15. degrees above the <HI>Horizon</HI> the lower part only of the <HI>circular explosion</HI> will brush the surface of the <HI>Earth</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 1. <HI>Fig.</HI> 8. and will make per∣haps but the <HI>Sextant</HI> of a <HI>Circle;</HI> if 22. degrees and ½ above it, a <HI>Quadrant;</HI> if 45, a <HI>Semicircle;</HI> if 67 ½, three fourths of a <HI>Circle,</HI> and so proportionably more or less in the <HI>intermediat</HI> degrees.</P>
<P N="36">36. And as to their growth, though it press much harder than the former, yet the difficulty appeareth not so insuperable, but that it may be replyed, that as the <HI>Explosion</HI> of <HI>Lightening</HI> when it first breaks the <HI>Cloud</HI> presses equally outward on every side, so 'tis like it may retain the same tendency after it has striken the <HI>Earth</HI> in such <HI>Rings</HI> as are intire, such being supposed to be made by streams of lightening descending in a <HI>Conical</HI> figure, and to strike the <HI>Earth</HI> in oblique lines on every side pointing all outwards, which possibly too infecting the <HI>Earth</HI> (for I look on them as a disease) with some noxious quality that may have somewhat of the nature of the <HI>Herpes</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a sort of <HI>Shingles</HI> which <HI>Sen∣nerius</HI> describes to be <HI>Morbus, qui una parte sanescente, in proxima serpit,</HI> or <HI>Malum ubi medium sanescit, extremis procedentibus</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dan.

<P N="37">37. Wherein I am the more confirmed, having observed some of the <HI>imperfect Segments</HI> of these <HI>Circles,</HI> especially the <HI>Semicircles,</HI> and such as obtain <HI>three parts</HI> of a <HI>Circle,</HI> to grow inward in the <HI>middle,</HI> where the <HI>Lightening</HI> hath struck the <HI>Earth</HI> strongest, much faster than elsewhere, so as to render them on that side <HI>irregular</HI> and <HI>crooked,</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 1. <HI>Fig.</HI> 9. which had they not done might have been an unanswerable objection against this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> it being
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>impossible indeed that such as these, made by a <HI>circular explosion</HI> of <HI>Lightening,</HI> that only brushes the <HI>earth</HI> on the lower side, the up∣per part vanishing in the thin <HI>Air</HI> should extend themselves other∣wise. And thus much for these <HI>Circles,</HI> and enough too perhaps may the <HI>Reader</HI> say to break my promise so solemnly made in the first §. of this <HI>Chapter, of not enlarging to the utmost compass of my theme;</HI> but herein I do not doubt but <HI>he</HI> will easily give me par∣don (as in all other <HI>subjects</HI> of the like kind) it haveing scarce ever been treated on before, by any other <HI>Author</HI> that I could ei∣ther meet with, or hear of.</P>
<P N="38">38. Next <HI>Lightening</HI> I proceed to the effects of <HI>Thunder</HI> that have sometimes happened in this <HI>County,</HI> which though not quite so <HI>deplorable</HI> as many mentioned by <HI>Authors,</HI> yet being as wonder∣ful in <HI>operation</HI> as any of them, are therefore no less <HI>remarkable:</HI> That <HI>Thunder</HI> now and then proves mortal to <HI>Animals,</HI> where the <HI>bolt</HI> has fallen any thing near though it never touch them, is evi∣dent from what happened at the <HI>Town</HI> of <HI>Ʋttoxater</HI> Anno 1678. at the House of the worthy and most courteous <HI>Gent.</HI> the Worship∣ful <HI>Thomas Kinnersley</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> where the <HI>bolt</HI> piercing the roof of his new <HI>Stable</HI> and cleaving the <HI>Timber</HI> in several places, and passing through two <HI>floores,</HI> and so through a <HI>Saddle</HI> that hung by the Walls into the <HI>pavement,</HI> though it never touched Mr. <HI>Wodenoth</HI>'s horse of <HI>Rocester</HI> then in the Stable (that could be perceived by any mark upon him) yet kill'd him out right: But that <HI>Thunder</HI> should mortally affect <HI>Animals</HI> at a great distance, and not near any pro∣bable fall of a <HI>bolt,</HI> is a much greater difficulty; and yet even this we find asserted from long experience, as I was informed by the forementioned worthy <HI>Gentleman</HI> the ingenious <HI>Thomas Broughton</HI> of <HI>Broughton</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who <HI>June</HI> the 14<SUP>th</SUP> 1680. haveing 15. dosen of <HI>Crevices</HI> brought him by a poor man that made it his business to catch them, and finding the better half of them dead, made enquiry of <HI>him</HI> what the reason might be; to whom the <HI>Man</HI> gave this rea∣dy reply, that the late <HI>Thunder</HI> had done it, and that he had ob∣served it to have the same effect on them divers times before; wherein I am very much inclined to believe <HI>him,</HI> haveing found it also at <HI>Queenborough</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Shepey</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> to kill their <HI>Lob∣sters</HI> in the like manner, and more especially those of the larger sise, a fish so altogether <HI>analogous</HI> to a <HI>Crevice,</HI> that they seem only to differ in magnitude, and place of abode.</P>
<P N="39">39. Now that the <HI>Horse</HI> was kill'd by the pestilential sulphure∣ous <HI>steam</HI> that the <HI>bolt</HI> brought with it (as I suppose all other <HI>A∣nimals</HI> are in the like Circumstances) is plain from the Testimony of the <HI>Groome,</HI> who had he not been near the <HI>door</HI> had hardly escaped it: But how the <HI>Crevices</HI> should be thus secretly destroyed

But that, notwithstanding it appear'd at <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Seigh∣ford</HI> in somewhat a different shape, and motion; at <HI>Oxford</HI> somewhat <HI>long</HI> with a round knob at the end, and moveing equally swift; at <HI>Seighford globular,</HI> and makeing short <HI>rests;</HI> yet it still might be the same individual <HI>Meteor,</HI> which (not to mention the mistakes perhaps occasioned through the inadvertency of the surprized <HI>Relators</HI>) might possibly alter a little in so great a distance: How∣ever
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>the thing were, it was certainly no other than one of the <HI>Me∣teors</HI> called <HI>Caprae Saltantes,</HI> for I find them both of a <HI>round</HI> and <HI>long</HI> figure, and to be so called, not from any thing they have of a <HI>goat,</HI> but their moveing by <HI>jerks,</HI> somewhat like the lascivious <HI>leaps</HI> of that <HI>Animal,</HI> and the little <HI>languets</HI> of fire that hang at, and some∣times fall from them, which antiquity ha's been pleased to fancy like the beard, or locks of a <HI>Goats</HI> wool: These frequently fly so high (notwithstanding they seem very low) that <HI>Meteorologists</HI> have placed them in the <HI>upper Region,</HI> but have not so firmly fixt them there, but that they allow the like also in the <HI>middle,</HI> and <HI>lower:</HI> How <HI>high</HI> this might be is not easy to determin, but cer∣tainly it could not be very <HI>low,</HI> it being seen at so many distant pla∣ces both in <HI>Longitude,</HI> and <HI>Latitude,</HI> so near the same time; which I presume that an ordinary <HI>Meteor</HI> in the <HI>lower Region</HI> could by no means be, though we allow its motion never so swift. Such a <HI>Ca∣pra</HI> it was that was seen about the bigness of the <HI>Moon,</HI> when <HI>Pau∣lus Aemilius</HI> waged War against <HI>Perseus</HI> King of <HI>Macedon, Nos quo∣que vidimus</HI> (says <HI>Seneca</HI>) <HI>non semel flammam ingentis pilae specie, quae tamen in ipso cursu suo dissipata est, i. e.</HI> that he also had seen a <HI>flame</HI> in the form of a great <HI>ball</HI> which disperst it self in its flight: such another he says was seen upon the departure of <HI>Augustus;</HI> a∣nother upon the <HI>Tragedy</HI> of <HI>Sejanus;</HI> and that the death of <HI>Ger∣manicus</HI> was signaliz'd by another<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">L.

All which, toge∣ther with this of ours at <HI>Wednesbury,</HI> I take only to be the <HI>Helena</HI> of the <HI>Ancients</HI> foretelling great <HI>stormes</HI> and ensuing <HI>devastations,</HI> such as the Rape of the <HI>Lady</HI> whose name they bear, brought up∣on <HI>Greece;</HI> the Physical reason whereof perhaps may be assigned right enough by the <HI>Ancients,</HI> viz. that while the <HI>Meteor</HI> remains compact and indisperst, it is a signe that the matter of the ensuing <HI>tempest</HI> is no where spent, as it proved in this of ours at the Church of <HI>Wednesbury,</HI> a great <HI>storme</HI> of <HI>hail</HI> and <HI>rain</HI> immediatly following it; whereas when such <HI>Meteors</HI> are divided, the <HI>prognostic</HI> is quite different, it being thence presumed that the matter of the <HI>tempest</HI> is weak and broken, the parts whereof antiently were called <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pollux, Deities</HI> it seems so favourable to <HI>Seamen,</HI> their appear∣ance always boding a prosperous voyage, that they usually made them the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of <HI>Ships,</HI> as we find them on the <HI>Ship</HI> of <HI>Alex∣andria</HI> in which St. <HI>Paul</HI> sailed from <HI>Melita</HI> to <HI>Syracuse</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> 28. v. 11.</NOTE>.</P>

Nor have the <HI>Heavens</HI> and <HI>Air</HI> only presented the <HI>Eye</HI> with unusual <HI>Objects,</HI> but also the <HI>Ear</HI> has sometimes been as much sur∣prized from them: for not to mention some unknown noises pre∣tended to have been heard about <HI>Alrewas,</HI> nor the shreeks as it were of persons about to be murdered said to be heard about <HI>Frod∣ley:</HI> We need go no farther for an instance than the same <HI>Town</HI> of <HI>Wednesbury,</HI> where the <HI>Colyers</HI> will tell you that early in the morn∣ing as they go to their work, and from the <HI>Cole-pits</HI> themselves, they sometimes hear the noise of a <HI>pack</HI> of <HI>bounds</HI> in the <HI>Air,</HI> which has happened so frequently that they have got a name for them, calling them <HI>Gabriels hounds,</HI> though the more sober and judicious take them only to be <HI>Wild-geese,</HI> making this noise in their <HI>flight;</HI> which perhaps may be probable enough, for upon consulting the <HI>Ornithologists</HI> I find them one of the gregarious <HI>migratory</HI> kind, to fly from <HI>Country</HI> to <HI>Country</HI> in the night, <HI>noctu trajiciunt</HI> says <HI>Al∣drovandus</HI> of them<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ulys.

<P N="45">45. And this perhaps may be the <HI>Musick</HI> that was heard in the <HI>Air</HI> by <HI>Francis Aldridg</HI> of <HI>Hammerwich</HI> a sober person about two in the morning near <HI>Michaelmas</HI> An. 1668. though he described it to be a sort of <HI>whistling</HI> in the <HI>Air,</HI> and the tune more melodious to him than any he ever heard in his life time, before or since; it be∣ing performed he said (as he judged) by some <HI>winged</HI> creatures, for he could hear their <HI>wings</HI> beat the <HI>Air,</HI> though he could not
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>see any thing by reason of the darkness: Though some will needs have it a consort of <HI>Angels</HI> transporting some blessed Soul that ex∣pired hereabout at that time, from <HI>grace</HI> to <HI>glory,</HI> haveing the un∣questionable Testimony of St. <HI>Augustin, Nicephorus, Gregory</HI> the <HI>great,</HI> and divers others, that such things have happened; for he sayd they seemed to take the <HI>tune</HI> from one another, as if they bore different <HI>parts</HI> in the same <HI>Antiphone</HI> for a quarter of an hour toge∣ther; much after the same manner as <HI>Johannes Herbinius</HI> reports it happen'd upon the death of <HI>Christopher Suessenbach Pastor</HI> of <HI>Bicine</HI> in <HI>Silesia,</HI> where such a <HI>Consort</HI> was heard also for a quarter of an hour together, all the <HI>Town</HI> over; some thinking it in the <HI>Tower</HI> of the Church, others in the <HI>Town-house,</HI> others upon the <HI>Walls;</HI> nay so distinctly was it heard, that the <HI>Organist</HI> of the <HI>Town</HI> being present, attempted to <HI>prick</HI> it down as a celestial pattern for all <HI>Church Musick,</HI> but all to no purpose, it so far transcended his skill<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Joh.

More common are the noises of <HI>Storms</HI> and <HI>Tempests</HI> whe∣ther of <HI>Hail, Rain,</HI> or <HI>Wind,</HI> though sometimes too, these happen to be very extraordinary, as at <HI>Chebsey</HI> the Sunday before St. <HI>James</HI> tide <HI>An.</HI> 1659. there fell a storm of <HI>Hail,</HI> the stones near as big as <HI>pullets eggs,</HI> which beat the young <HI>apples</HI> and <HI>leaves</HI> from the <HI>trees,</HI> and the <HI>Cabbage leaves</HI> from the <HI>stalks</HI> so that they appeared naked; nay so violent was it that it raised a <HI>steam</HI> in the <HI>street</HI> so thick that they could not see cross it; and yet falling <HI>perpendicular</HI> it broke none of their <HI>windows;</HI> as did another storme of Hail that on <HI>June</HI> 16. <HI>An.</HI> 1676. fell at the Village of <HI>Dunstall</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Taten∣hill,</HI> which as I was informed by my worthy friend Mr. <HI>John Bott</HI> also cut the <HI>stalks</HI> of the <HI>Wheat</HI> and <HI>Barley</HI> (then in <HI>spindle</HI>) quite asunder, and so the very <HI>grass</HI> it self; the <HI>stones</HI> being some of them near four inches about, and most of them of unequal various figures.

<P N="48">48. And indeed I think we must have acquiest in it, but that the same difficulty seems to press this opinion, as the former; for why should they not fall from the <HI>Clouds,</HI> as well as come forth of their <HI>caverns,</HI> in different <HI>sizes?</HI> Besides in all likelyhood we should find them all bruised against the ground, trees, or building, and half dead with their fall, should they come from thence; than which nothing less: Much rather therefore should I think them produced upon the surface of the <HI>earth.</HI> and tops of <HI>houses</HI> where they are first found, by a <HI>fermentation</HI> excited in the <HI>dust</HI> (which in some places may have a peculiar disposition for it) by the fall and commixtion of <HI>rain water</HI> with it, in hot soultry weather.

<P N="50">50. As to such <HI>rains</HI> as are usual and frequent amongst us, I met with nothing observable concerning them, but an uncommon <HI>prognostick</HI> when they should happen, communicated to me by the learned and ingenious <HI>Gent.

Much more accurat and certain was the same <HI>Samuel Tay∣lor</HI> in predicting the <HI>winds,</HI> than the <HI>rains</HI> that attend them, though even in this too he made use of the <HI>Clouds</HI> themselves, which when ever he perceived to rise in the <HI>form</HI> of the letter V, jagg'd on each side, and therefore called by the <HI>water-men</HI> the <HI>Harts-head;</HI> he forth with concluded infallibly that the next point of the <HI>Compass</HI> to which the <HI>wind</HI> should shift, would be either the oppo∣site one to the most <HI>patulous</HI> part of the V or <HI>Harts-head</HI> (which though happens but seldom) or the <HI>point</HI> to which the <HI>acute</HI> angle of the same <HI>Harts-head</HI> seems nearest to direct it self, and this most frequently happens, always one of the two; which I am told is a <HI>truth</HI> that no <HI>water-man</HI> whatever that sailes the <HI>Severne</HI> will call into question: And indeed I do not doubt but the latter of the two must needs be most frequent, since we see in <HI>Aeolipiles, Winde-Guns</HI> and all other <HI>explosions</HI> of <HI>Air,</HI> that it still spreads as it pro∣ceeds from the <HI>terminus à quo;</HI> well therefore may it be conclud∣ed that the <HI>wind</HI> must proceed from that <HI>quarter,</HI> whence the <HI>Clouds</HI> appear more <HI>patulous</HI> and open; as the <HI>Ancients</HI> observed it in <HI>Halo's,</HI> which if intire and well defined argued a calm season, but if rent or broken on any side, they expected a <HI>wind</HI> from that point of the <HI>Heavens,</HI> on which the <HI>Cirque</HI> of the <HI>Halo</HI> was inter∣rupted: <HI>Inde ventum Nautici expectant, unde contextus Coronae pe∣rit,</HI> says <HI>Seneca</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">L.

Which perhaps indeed may be some of the most certain <HI>prognosticks</HI> we can hope for of <HI>winds,</HI> but then we must restrain them to such as have their <HI>origin</HI> in the <HI>middle Region,</HI> from the rarefaction of <HI>vapors</HI> by the <HI>Sun,</HI> either before or after their coali∣tion into <HI>Clouds:</HI> which <HI>rarefaction</HI> making a greater <HI>repletion,</HI> and consequently a <HI>protrusion</HI> that way where the <HI>Medium</HI> is most yeild∣ing, causes a <HI>wind</HI> from such or such a peculiar <HI>point</HI> of the <HI>Com∣pass</HI> rather than any other, and is certainly shewn by the opening of the more loose and floating <HI>Clouds</HI> (those whence we expect <HI>wind</HI> being not so <HI>dense</HI> or <HI>opacous</HI> as those pregnant with <HI>showers</HI>) which are sensible of the <HI>impression</HI> for some time, before the <HI>Air</HI> here below is assimulated to the motion begun at so great a di∣stance; where nothing intervening to controul or interrupt its course, it is propagated in a right line, and is much more certain than any <HI>wind</HI> generated either from the <HI>Aeolian caverns</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> or the <HI>lower Region,</HI> which are obnoxious in great measure to the situation of the <HI>Countries</HI> through which they pass, making <HI>Maeanders, deflections</HI> and undergoing various <HI>repercussions,</HI> ac∣cording as they meet with <HI>Forrests, Promontories, Mountains,</HI> or winding <HI>Valleys</HI> betwixt them, in their way; though indeed in the wide <HI>Seas,</HI> and open level <HI>Countries,</HI> these <HI>winds</HI> are near as <HI>regu∣lar,</HI> as those that blow <HI>aloft;</HI> as they really would be every where, were the <HI>terraqueous Globe</HI> of a uniform <HI>superficies.</HI></P>
<P N="53">53. Nor heard I of any thing more relating to <HI>winds,</HI> but that not long since betwixt <HI>Offley-hay</HI> and <HI>Slindon,</HI> there happen'd a <HI>Typhon</HI> or <HI>Tornado-wind,</HI> which though not above forty yards broad (as appeared by the mischief it did) or extending it self in length a∣bove three or four <HI>Miles,</HI> yet was so powerful as it pass't through a <HI>Coppice</HI> near Sr. <HI>John Pershal</HI>'s house of <HI>great Sugnal</HI> that it tore up the greatest Okes by the roots and made as it were a <HI>Vista</HI> through it, as was shewed me by the courteous and obliging <HI>Gent.</HI> Mr. <HI>Bos∣vile</HI> of <HI>Byanna,</HI> which I take to have been done by a <HI>dip</HI> of <HI>wind,</HI> express't obliquely from a narrow passage betwixt two <HI>Clouds</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 1. fig. 10. which meeting with some <HI>cross wind</HI> or denser part of the <HI>Atmosphere</HI> at A, was thrown violently towards the ground at B which take for <HI>Offley-hay,</HI> was strongest at C which suppose to be <HI>Sugnal,</HI> and rose again at D which may pass for <HI>Slindon,</HI> and so mounted into the <HI>Air</HI> again to E, out of all distance for doing any further harm, curleing it self into a Helix after the manner of <HI>Tor∣nado</HI>'s, as Mr. <HI>Bohun</HI> in his discourse of the <HI>Origin</HI> of <HI>Winds</HI> has in∣geniously
<PB N="28" REF="25"/>express't it<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">R.

<P N="54">54. And now having so long entertained the <HI>Reader</HI> with the <HI>serious</HI> and sometimes <HI>Melancholy</HI> effects, let me refresh him a lit∣tle with the <HI>Sports,</HI> of <HI>Nature;</HI> such as a new discourse with the <HI>Nymph Echo,</HI> a <HI>Mistris</HI> notwithstanding what is discover'd in <HI>Ox∣fordshire,</HI> yet has new <HI>intrigues,</HI> and must farther be courted, be∣fore she will throughly be understood; not but that I think the distribution and admeasurement of <HI>Echo's</HI> is rightly and fully as∣signed in that <HI>History;</HI> but that I have met with some here, that though they may all be reduced to some one or other of the <HI>spe∣cies</HI> there mentioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nat.

<P N="56">56. Other <HI>Echo's</HI> there are none so very different from those of <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> as the three above mentioned, nor indeed are there any of the same <HI>kind,</HI> so very considerable as that of <HI>Woodstock</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Nat. Hist. of Oxfordsh. <HI>chap. 1. §. 15.</HI></NOTE>; the best polysyllabical articulat <HI>Echo's</HI> we have in this <HI>County,</HI> are 1. that of <HI>Dunston</HI> in a field <HI>west</HI> of the <HI>Chappel,</HI> where in the path way at due distance from it, you may have a return of seven or eight syllables; and so you may 2. From <HI>Elmhurst-Hall</HI> in a <HI>Meddow</HI> to the South-East of it. But 3. that which comes nearest to <HI>Wood∣stock,</HI> and indeed is the best of the kind in the <HI>County,</HI> is that at <HI>Norbury, North-easterly</HI> from the <HI>Manor</HI> near a little bank under the wood side about 80. poles or 440. yards distant, which in a <HI>still day</HI> will repeat 10. or a 11. syllables distinctly, or 12. or 13, if spoken quick; the <HI>Object</HI> whereof must needs be the <HI>Manor</HI> for there can be none nearer whatever there may be further off, and yet in this, as at <HI>Woodstock</HI> (however it was at <HI>Tatenhill</HI>) if we take the <HI>Manor</HI> for the <HI>object,</HI> there will go 120 feet or 40 yards to each syllable, or if further off (for the <HI>voice</HI> methinks seems to pass by the <HI>Manor,</HI> to the trees on the left hand of it) perhaps twice as much; which instructs us we must allow a much greater <HI>Latitude</HI> in these matters; though of the same <HI>kind,</HI> than has hitherto been thought of.</P>
<P N="57">57. But as for <HI>Tautological polyphonous Echo's,</HI> such as return a word or more often repeated from divers objects by <HI>simple refle∣ction,</HI> there are as good here, or perhaps better than any in <HI>Oxford∣shire;</HI> there being one at <HI>Beaudesart</HI> in the little <HI>Park</HI> about the middle of the path that leads from the <HI>pale</HI> to the <HI>House,</HI> that from a treble <HI>object</HI> answers distinctly three times: And another near <HI>Hampsted</HI> (The seat of the much honored and my truly noble Patron, the right worshipful Sr. <HI>John VVyrley</HI> Kt.) on the bank side in a field South-easterly from the <HI>house,</HI> that from a quadruple <HI>Ob∣ject,</HI> answers as distinctly four times, though the <HI>objects</HI> indeed be as <HI>obscure</HI> as the matter of fact is <HI>plain</HI> und <HI>evident;</HI> which per∣haps may be as good an one of this kind, as one shall easily meet with, all the <HI>objects</HI> and <HI>returnes</HI> being still more <HI>remote,</HI> and <HI>weak∣er,</HI> than one another; the second than the first, the third than the second, and the fourth than the third, and so onward; so that af∣ter
<PB N="30" REF="27"/><HI>four</HI> returns, the <HI>fift</HI> is most commonly out of the <HI>reflex action</HI> of the <HI>voice.</HI></P>
<P N="58">58. Unless in such <HI>Echo's</HI> as have divers <HI>objects</HI> placed so near together, and near at hand, that though they scarce will admit of a <HI>Dissyllable,</HI> yet by numerous <HI>reflections</HI> to and froe from one <HI>object</HI> to another, will return a <HI>Hum</HI> or <HI>clap</HI> with the <HI>hands</HI> much more <HI>quick</HI> and frequently, perhaps some of them ten or a dosen times or more, the <HI>voice</HI> or <HI>clap</HI> fadeing as it were, or dying away by de∣grees in a <HI>trembling</HI> manner, rateably to the <HI>remoteness</HI> and <HI>weak∣ness</HI> of the <HI>reflections.</HI> And such a <HI>tremulous Echo</HI> there is (for I cannot fit it with a better <HI>Epithet</HI>) at <HI>Elmhurst-Hall</HI> on the <HI>tarras</HI> walk in the <HI>Garden</HI> behind the <HI>house,</HI> where the various <HI>windings</HI> and <HI>angles</HI> of the <HI>walls,</HI> return a <HI>hum</HI> or <HI>clap</HI> with the <HI>hands</HI> (the weather being calm) ten or a dosen times, so thick and close that it admits of nothing <HI>articulat</HI> unless we may account a <HI>monosyllable</HI> so. Which was shewn me by the Worshipful <HI>Michael Biddulph</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the <HI>Proprietor</HI> of the <HI>place,</HI> whose <HI>favours</HI> have been so <HI>signal</HI> in promoting this <HI>work,</HI> that I could do no less in gratitude than represent the <HI>House</HI> in <HI>Sculpture Tab.</HI> 2. it being one of the chief <HI>seats</HI> of the <HI>Family,</HI> and as uniform, splendid, and commodious a <HI>building</HI> as most in the <HI>County.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. THe learned, and therefore truly Noble <HI>Philosopher,</HI> my Lord <HI>Viscount St. Albans,</HI> in his <HI>History</HI> of Life and Death, or prolongation of Life; as well considering the <HI>consumption</HI> of the body of Man, as <HI>reparation</HI> of it; the one being as much to be <HI>prevented,</HI> as the other <HI>promoted;</HI> in the for∣mer of these makes the <HI>ambient Air</HI> of eminent concern; some sorts of it being as predatory and wastful of the body, as others again are comfortable and refreshing: Whence it is that <HI>Persons</HI> of plentiful <HI>Estates,</HI> that have (as we say) the world at will, and are not tyed to a single <HI>Seat;</HI> either build or make choise of one for their most common residence, that is situat in a good and whol∣some <HI>Air:</HI> where by <HI>Air</HI> they intend not the <HI>simple Element</HI> of the <HI>Ancients,</HI> for in this sense all <HI>Air</HI> (if there be any such thing) is equally pure; but that somwhat grosser substance that immediat∣ly incompasses the <HI>terraqueous Globe,</HI> wherein we daily breath, live, and have our being; which is commonly fill'd with all sorts of <HI>Exhalations,</HI> and is comparatively good or bad, healthy or other∣wise; as it partakes more or less, of wholsome or noxious, <HI>vapors</HI> or <HI>fumes;</HI> exhaled either from quick liveing streams, or stagnant pooles and uliginous boggs; from dry wholsome Soils, or mineral Earths. Which seeming indeed the more immediat causes of <HI>sickness</HI> or <HI>health</HI> than the pure <HI>Air,</HI> that being only the vehicle of diseases, and not fundamentally good or bad, but by partici∣pation, as was hinted in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Nat.

<P N="2">2. But that the <HI>Reader</HI> may not only be amused with <HI>generalls,</HI> let us treat of this matter more <HI>distinctly</HI> than usual, and strictly examin whether this <HI>Air</HI> we breath in, do indeed so much affect the <HI>body</HI> of <HI>Man</HI> as is commonly pretended; and if so, which it is that comforteth and conserveth it most, and which most preyeth upon it, so as to hasten its consumption; that certainly being to be esteemed the most <HI>healthy,</HI> that prolongeth; and that the most <HI>unhealthy,</HI> that abridgeth its duration: Wherein I shall not need to trouble the <HI>Reader</HI> with any of the nice <HI>Experiments</HI> of the <HI>Air-Pump,</HI> whereof some not unfitly might have been reduced to this
<PB N="33" REF="30"/>subject; nor with a profound explication of the <HI>flammula Cordis,</HI> or what ever else it is that continually gives <HI>accension</HI> to our <HI>blood,</HI> and is cherish't by the gentle refocillations of the <HI>Air:</HI> It being suf∣ficient for my purpose, and evident even to <HI>rural Observators;</HI> first that the <HI>Air,</HI> impregnated with <HI>vapors</HI> and <HI>fumes</HI> (such as is the <HI>Atmosphere</HI> wherein we breath) doth sensibly affect the <HI>body</HI> of <HI>Man;</HI> witness the common <HI>fumigations</HI> made in <HI>hysterical diseases</HI> to recall the <HI>Spirits,</HI> and the too too common <HI>Experiment</HI> of <HI>Drun∣kenness;</HI> with which no question its more inartificial operations bear some proportion, though they are not so sensible.</P>
<P N="3">3. It being plain then that the <HI>Air</HI> as it may be variously quali∣fyed does affect the <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>humors,</HI> and consequently the whole <HI>Crasis</HI> of the body: it remains secondly that we shew which <HI>Airs</HI> they be, that most refresh and preserve it; and on the contrary which prey upon it, so as either to consume it gradually, or destroy it on a sudden: for the clearer disquisition of which matter I must premise some <HI>postulata,</HI> which I need not to doubt (I think) but will be easily granted, since they are such only as are universally agreed on: As first that the <HI>blood</HI> principally, and o∣ther <HI>humors;</HI> are the <HI>subjectum in quo,</HI> or vehicle of the <HI>spirits</HI> by which the <HI>Animal operations</HI> of the <HI>body</HI> are performed; and 2. that the more the <HI>spirits, flammula,</HI> or <HI>heat</HI> do prey upon the <HI>hu∣mors,</HI> or the <HI>humors</HI> oppress the <HI>spirits,</HI> so much the shorter is the continuance of that <HI>body;</HI> and that therefore 3. in order to a last∣ing duration, the <HI>spirits</HI> ought to be kept in such a moderate tem∣per, that (as the Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> well observes<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Life and Death, Intent. <HI>1.</HI> Operat. <HI>1.

A more close consideration of <HI>waters,</HI> wherein perhaps it may be expected that I should determin also their <HI>goodness</HI> and <HI>badness,</HI> as before of <HI>Air;</HI> but the healthyness and unhealthyness of the <HI>Air</HI> depending so much upon the <HI>goodness</HI> and <HI>badness</HI> of the <HI>waters</HI> as has been shewn above, it seems so far to have been per∣formed already, that it may well suffice here to add in general (which perhaps may pass for an <HI>Aphorisme</HI>) that as that <HI>air</HI> is counted best that comes nearest the pure <HI>Aether,</HI> and that the worst which is fill'd most with <HI>Exhalations</HI> and comes nearest <HI>wa∣ter;</HI> so that is to be esteemed the best <HI>water</HI> which comes nearest <HI>air,</HI> and that the worst which is stagnant, muddy, and fill'd with <HI>terrestrieties,</HI> and comes nearest <HI>Earth:</HI> In a word, wouldest thou have a wholsom <HI>water</HI> indeed for thy common use? choose that which has neither colour, tast, or smell, from <HI>Salts</HI> or <HI>Sulphurs,</HI> or as little of them as may be; for these will some way or other affect thy <HI>meats</HI> or <HI>drinks,</HI> or whatever else thou employest them about, otherwise than thou did'st intend they should. that is to say choose those that will receive <HI>heat,</HI> and <HI>coole</HI> sooner than others; into which a glass <HI>Hydrometer</HI> or water-Gage, or any other natant weighty body will <HI>sink deepest;</HI> or which will cause least <HI>refra∣ction;</HI> all which argue a freedom from <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Sulphure,</HI> where∣with

Whence the learned and ingenious <HI>Sr. Simon Degg Knight</HI> (whose assistances I must always gratefully acknowledge) has some thoughts that the <HI>Eastern,</HI> may be much lower than the <HI>Western</HI> Sea; the descent of <HI>Trent</HI> through <HI>Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire</HI> and <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> seeming much greater, than the <HI>Dane,</HI> and some other branches of the <HI>Ri∣ver
<PB N="43" REF="36"/>Wever,</HI> that rise about <HI>Biddulph, Talk</HI> on the hill, <HI>Audley, Betley,</HI> and <HI>Madeley,</HI> can possibly have through the level <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Chester</HI> into the <HI>Irish Sea.</HI> Of which perhaps more hereafter in due time and place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. §. §. <HI>84, 85, 86.</HI> of this Chapter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="21">21. Nor has <HI>Trent</HI> only and <HI>Wever</HI> these great supplies of wa∣ter from the fountains of this <HI>County,</HI> but many branches of the <HI>Severn</HI> (the second <HI>River</HI> of <HI>England</HI>) have their rise here also, as the <HI>Terne, Smestal, Flashbrook,</HI> and the others that come forth <HI>Aqua∣lat</HI> and <HI>Snowdon</HI> poole: To which add that the <HI>Meese, Stour,</HI> and <HI>Severn</HI> it self (the only <HI>navigable</HI> River in it) also pass through this <HI>County:</HI> All which summ'd up together, we find at the foot of the account, that it is water'd with no less than 24. <HI>Rivers</HI> of <HI>name,</HI> though a Mediterranean County; besides the endless number of <HI>anonymous Rindles</HI> and small <HI>brooks</HI> that must needs attend them; a <HI>number</HI> perhaps that very few <HI>Countries</HI> of the like extent can be found to surpass, if any that equals, it. And some of these too of so rank precipitant streams especially the <HI>Dove</HI> and <HI>Dane</HI> (there being here and there in them, near the fountain heads some small <HI>Cascades</HI>) that in time of floods they break down <HI>Bridges,</HI> and re∣move <HI>stones</HI> of <HI>immense</HI> magnitude, and the <HI>Dove</HI> sometimes will change its <HI>channel;</HI> which I suppose ha's been the cause that a part of <HI>Staffordshire</HI> in the parish of <HI>Mathfield</HI> lyes on <HI>Derbyshire</HI> side the <HI>River,</HI> and a little below (near the bridge you pass over to <HI>Snelston</HI>) a part of <HI>Derbyshire</HI> on the <HI>Staffordshire</HI> side: Nay so very sharp too are some of the lesser <HI>brooks</HI> upon sudden rains; that, as I was seriously told by that ingenious Gent. Mr. <HI>Philip Hollins</HI> of <HI>Moseleie,</HI> the little <HI>Rivulet</HI> called <HI>Cowms brook</HI> that runs betwixt his house and <HI>Basford,</HI> into <HI>Churnet;</HI> once removed a stone of three or four <HI>Tun,</HI> at least a bows shoot.</P>
<P N="22">22. The <HI>Currents</HI> also of most of the other <HI>Rivers</HI> are rapid enough, but some of them indeed muth quicker then others, as the <HI>Trent</HI> than <HI>Sow,</HI> and <HI>Sow</HI> than <HI>Penk;</HI> yet all of them so swift, as to prevent any vapid noisom <HI>vapors</HI> from ascending thence to infect the <HI>Air,</HI> though it must needs indeed be rateably better or worse, according as their <HI>streames</HI> be swifter or flower. Beside the <HI>Rivers,</HI> the <HI>Meers</HI> and <HI>Pools</HI> of this <HI>County</HI> are many and large, whereof that at <HI>Aqualat</HI> is 1848 <HI>yards</HI> long, and 672 <HI>yards</HI> broad, which it holds within a trifle more or lesse, almost from one end to the other; and <HI>Ladford poole</HI> is said to contain about threescore Acres; to which add <HI>Cockmeer, Eccleshall Castle</HI> pooles, <HI>New-poole,</HI> the poole at <HI>Mare,</HI> with divers others: All which either having <HI>Rivulets</HI> that continually pass through them, or being fed with liveing <HI>Springs,</HI> and plentifully stock't with Fish which perpe∣tually
<PB N="44" REF="37"/>move the <HI>Waters,</HI> they are always kept so clear and free from <HI>stagnation,</HI> that in a manner they send up as few noxious exhala∣tions as the <HI>Rivers</HI> themselves.</P>
<P N="23">23 Amongst which we must not forget the <HI>Poole</HI> or <HI>Lake</HI> menti∣oned by Mr <HI>Camden</HI> out of <HI>Gervase</HI> of <HI>Tilbury,</HI> who in his <HI>Otia Imperialia</HI> to <HI>Otho</HI> the <HI>fourth,</HI> says that in the <HI>Bishoprick of</HI> Coventry <HI>and County of</HI> Stafford, <HI>at the foot of a Hill, which the inborn people of the</HI> Country <HI>have named</HI> Mahull, <HI>there is a water spread abroad in manner of a</HI> Meere, <HI>in the territory of a</HI> Village <HI>which they terme</HI> Magdalea; <HI>in which</HI> Meer, <HI>or</HI> Marsh <HI>there is a most clear wa∣ter, which hath such an effectuall virtue in refreshing of bodies, that so often as</HI> Hunters <HI>have chased</HI> staggs, <HI>and other</HI> Deere <HI>untill their</HI> Horses <HI>be tired, if in the greatest heat of the scorching</HI> Sun <HI>they tast of this</HI> water, <HI>and offer it unto their</HI> horses <HI>for to drink, they re∣cover their strength of running again which they had lost, and become so fresh as one would think they had not run at all.</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Camden's Britannia in Staffordshire sub finem.</NOTE>. But where about this should be, says <HI>Mr Camden,</HI> I cannot yet learn, nor indeed could I hear of any such <HI>Hill,</HI> though that at <HI>Heyley Castle</HI> having a great <HI>poole</HI> at the foot, seems agreeable enough to it, being near also to the <HI>village</HI> of <HI>Madeley,</HI> perhaps anciently called <HI>Magdalea;</HI> which I so little doubt will refresh a <HI>Horse</HI> if he drink thereof after he is tired with running, that I firmly beleive all the pooles in the <HI>County,</HI> will doe the very same, being generally clear &amp; brisk; and but few flat or vapid.</P>
<P N="24">24 Tis true indeed in the <HI>Moorelands</HI> where they burn much <HI>Peat,</HI> their pits are usually fill'd by the frequent <HI>rains</HI> brought by the <HI>Tropaean winds</HI> from the <HI>Irish Seas</HI> in which the water being sated with a crude <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and <HI>stagnating</HI> besides, must needs emitt contagious vapors; yet are not these neither so bad as some have fancyed the <HI>water</HI> is of the <HI>black-Meer</HI> of <HI>Morridge,</HI> which I take to be nothing more than such as those in the <HI>peat-pits;</HI> though it be confidently reported that no <HI>Cattle</HI> will drink of it, no <HI>bird</HI> light on it, or fly over it; all which are as false as that it is <HI>bottomlesse;</HI> it being found upon measure scarce four <HI>yards</HI> in the deepest place, my <HI>Horse</HI> also drinking when I was there as freely of it as I ever saw Him at any other place, and the <HI>fowle</HI> so far from declining to fly over it, that I spake with several that had seen <HI>Geese</HI> upon it; so that I take this to be as good as the rest, not∣withstanding the vulgar disrepute it lyes under.</P>
<P N="25">25. Though indeed they are all <HI>unwholsome</HI> enough in them∣selves, and would be so to the <HI>Inhabitants,</HI> but that the <HI>Moorelands</HI> is an open <HI>Country</HI> lying high, and the Hills cloathed neither with <HI>woods</HI> or <HI>groves,</HI> so that being lyable to the smallest <HI>brises</HI> of wind,
<PB N="45" REF="37"/>the noxious exhalations whenever they arise (except in deep <HI>Calmes</HI> which are every where unwhosom) are always dispers∣ed; which is so <HI>soveraign</HI> a <HI>remedy,</HI> that the <HI>Mooreland</HI> Country notwithstanding their <HI>Boggs,</HI> is really as healthy perhaps as the best part of the <HI>County;</HI> if the great <HI>Age</HI> and constant <HI>health</HI> of the <HI>Inhabitants,</HI> that have been lately, and are now living there, may pass (as sure they ought) for sufficient proof of the matter, of both which, were I put upon it, I could no where find such preg∣nant instances; The Worshipful Mr. <HI>Biddulph</HI> of <HI>Biddulph</HI> (as I was informed by divers) having not long since had twelve <HI>Tenants</HI> all living at a time within the two <HI>Parishes</HI> of <HI>Biddulph</HI> and <HI>Hor∣ton,</HI> whose <HI>Ages</HI> put together made up a thousand years: And the Worshipfull <HI>William Leveson Gower</HI> of <HI>Trentham</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> having now four <HI>Tenants</HI> all living at <HI>Cocknage</HI> in the edge of the <HI>Moorelands</HI> that one with another make 360 years; which I take for such co∣gent and insuperable <HI>Evidences</HI> (to omit many others of the like kind) that nothing more need be added in this place; the <HI>Lon∣gevity</HI> of persons belonging to another.</P>
<P N="26">26. And so much for the <HI>waters</HI> of more common use, as they are ordinarily found in <HI>Pooles, Springs,</HI> or <HI>Rivers;</HI> come we next to consider those that have somwhat unusual in them, whether in their <HI>Exit, course,</HI> or saturation with <HI>Sulphurs</HI> or <HI>Mineral Salts,</HI> or howsoever remarkable upon any other account: And first of the <HI>Pooles;</HI> whereof there is one at <HI>Penford,</HI> which though a standing <HI>Lake</HI> yet is seldom dry, and tolerably clear in setled fair weather, only against <HI>rain</HI> it becomes troubled, riseing full of <HI>bubbles,</HI> and in a little time thickening at the top into a yellow <HI>Scum,</HI> which presently as it <HI>rains</HI> vanishes away, and the <HI>water</HI> recovers again its former colour and clearness: All which has frequently been observed and found to be true by the worthy Mr. <HI>Fowler</HI> an inha∣bitant of the place, who freely confest that he had often been ad∣monisht by it in time of <HI>harvest</HI> to fetch in his Corne, and at other times made the same use of it, as we do of <HI>weather-glasses</HI> or other <HI>Hygroscopes,</HI> so that as to the matter of fact I doubt not at all, though I had not opportunity of makeing <HI>Experiment</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="27">27. But how this should come to pass is the great question? in order to the solution whereof I could not but call to mind that up∣on the approach of <HI>Rain</HI> there are few standing pooles that do not rise in <HI>bubbles,</HI> which some have attributed to the <HI>Eeles</HI> or other fish, which they would have to be as sensible of approaching <HI>stormes</HI> as we dayly see <HI>birds</HI> and <HI>beasts</HI> are, and perhaps so they may: whether this <HI>Poole</HI> were stock't with <HI>fish</HI> or no I did not enquire, nor matters it much whether it be or no, since I am sure the same happens where there are <HI>none;</HI> beside, that it would be somwhat
<PB N="46" REF="38"/>unaccountable too, how they should raise a yellow <HI>Scumme:</HI> It seems therefore in my <HI>judgment</HI> much more probable, that the pores of the <HI>Earth</HI> being at such times unlock't (bodies much more compact also yeilding and expanding themselves against <HI>rain</HI> as we see it in our <HI>wainscots,</HI> in the boards of Mr. <HI>Conniers</HI>'s<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph. Transact.</HI> Numb. 127. <HI>and</HI> 129.</NOTE>, and <HI>coards</HI> of the <HI>Sieur Grillet's</HI> new <HI>Hygrometer</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><HI>Weekly Memorials,</HI> Numb. 1. p. 8.</NOTE>) many <HI>steams</HI> breath forth, which being as various as the <HI>earths</HI> from whence they pro∣ceed, produce as different <HI>fermentations</HI> in the <HI>mud</HI> and <HI>water,</HI> which thicken it and occasion those <HI>bubbles</HI> to ascend; whence passing into the <HI>Air,</HI> and repelling its pressure, they may be as likely too, to cause the falling of the <HI>Quicksilver</HI> in our <HI>Barometers,</HI> as any thing perhaps that has hitherto been thought of.</P>
<P N="28">28. The <HI>ascent</HI> of these <HI>steams</HI> that thus disturb the <HI>Mud</HI> &amp;c. I take also to be the occasion that <HI>Ducks</HI> and other <HI>water fowle</HI> clap their <HI>wings</HI> and rejoyce upon approaching <HI>rains,</HI> and are after so busy with their heads under water, I suppose, to see what they can catch by the way: Which if true in the <HI>general,</HI> let us now come home to the <HI>particular</HI> case in hand, and see how it comes to pass that such a yellow <HI>scumme</HI> should be sent up thus to cover the face of the water. Wherein though it cannot very well be ex∣pected that I should allege very many, or very probable reasons, being unhappily prevented of seeing the place, by ill weather and approach of night; yet perhaps I may not over much miss of the mark, if I guess it may be done by the ascent of <HI>Niter</HI> or some <HI>ni∣trous fume,</HI> that mixing with a <HI>Sulphur</HI> in the bottom of the <HI>Lake,</HI> and sharply corroding and separating its parts, may thus send them up to the surface of the <HI>water,</HI> which may be repell'd or dis∣perst again upon the <HI>descent</HI> of the <HI>rain:</HI> in which <HI>conjecture</HI> I am not a little confirm'd, because at <HI>Codsall</HI> not far off there is <HI>sulphur</HI> enough in the <HI>earth</HI> as shall be shewn in due place, which yet I am not sollicitous should longer pass for the reason, than till a better can be brought to supply its roome.</P>
<P N="29">29. And as this foretells <HI>Rain,</HI> so there are several other <HI>Pooles</HI> that prognosticat a <HI>dearth,</HI> either by riseing, or overflowing: such is the <HI>Moss poole</HI> near <HI>Mearton</HI> in the parish of <HI>Forton;</HI> and <HI>Drude∣meer</HI> in the parish of <HI>Aldridge;</HI> the <HI>riseing</HI> of the former, and <HI>ex∣undation</HI> of the latter, (which generally at other times is near dry) being taken for certain <HI>signes</HI> of a <HI>dearth</HI> of Corne: and perhaps so they may indeed not without reason, our <HI>dearths</HI> here in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> being most frequently the <HI>consequents</HI> of great <HI>Rains.</HI> But that which excells all the rest in this <HI>feat</HI> is <HI>Hungry pit,</HI> situat in a field below the old fortification not far from <HI>Billington,</HI> but in the parish of <HI>Seighford,</HI> so called I suppose, for that contrary to the rise
<PB N="47" REF="38"/>of <HI>Nile</HI> upon the pillar of <HI>Mikias</HI> in the Isle <HI>Roud</HI> or <HI>Garden</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">F. Vanslebius his present State of Egypt. Cap. of the Pillar Mikias.</NOTE> which brings plenty, this predicts scarcity by its rise upon <HI>sticks,</HI> set up∣right in the mud, which the people place there every one for their own particular <HI>observations;</HI> forejudging the rise or fall of <HI>corne</HI> in the <HI>Mercats,</HI> by the rise or fall of the water on these <HI>sticks,</HI> and so either keeping or vending it accordingly: wherein it so little re∣guards the quality of the <HI>weather,</HI> that it overflowes sometimes in the greatest <HI>droughts</HI> (as I saw it do in the dry Spring Anno. 1680.) and as often has nothing in it after great falls of <HI>rain;</HI> as was testifyed to me from the frequent <HI>observations</HI> of divers so∣ber persons now living thereabout: who also assured me that the remarks made upon it had been so profitable to some (whether by <HI>casualty</HI> or not, they could not tell) that they had advanced their <HI>fortunes</HI> considerably by it.</P>
<P N="30">30. How many concurrent causes and circumstances attending them, may unite in produceing of such an effect, though it be hard to determin, yet thus much I think we may pronounce for cer∣tain, that it must needs be done by the mediation of <HI>Springs:</HI> into which opinion I am the rather induced, because I find the same <HI>in∣termissions</HI> in many <HI>fountains,</HI> particularly in the <HI>Well</HI> South of <HI>Whittington</HI> Church, which though it want not <HI>water</HI> at any time whatever, yet <HI>overflowes</HI> (they say) extreamly against a <HI>dearth</HI> of <HI>Corne:</HI> But in the <HI>Church</HI> field not far from thence, in a piece of ground call'd <HI>Hunger-moore-slade</HI> belonging to Mr. <HI>Nicholas Harvey</HI> of <HI>Whittington,</HI> there is a <HI>Spring</HI> that breaks forth (according to the opinion of the people) only before a time of great <HI>dearth,</HI> be∣ing at all other times <HI>dry</HI> though at the <HI>wettest</HI> seasons, as I found it in <HI>Autumn An.</HI> 1680. after a full <HI>Moneths</HI> rain: And when it does break forth (which for the most part happens not in several <HI>years</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nonnulli [fontes] ad multum tempus cessant effluere, deinde rursus emergunt.

<Q>Whether the <HI>Springs</HI> are supplyed with that great <HI>Expence</HI> of water, that we see they dayly vent, from <HI>Rains, Mists, Dews, Snows, Haile &amp;c.</HI> received into the Spungy tops of <HI>Mountains</HI> and sent forth again at the feet of them, or somwhere in their declivities; or whe∣ther they are furnish't from the <HI>Sea</HI> through subterraneous passages, as from the great <HI>Treasury</HI> of the <HI>waters,</HI> and are return'd again thither by the <HI>Rindles, Brooks,</HI> and <HI>Rivers?</HI> Or in short, whether they have their <HI>Origine</HI> from the <HI>Sea</HI> by a <HI>superior Circulation</HI> through the <HI>Clouds;</HI> or by an <HI>inferior,</HI> through <HI>Channels</HI> in the bowells of the <HI>Earth?</HI> or from both?</Q> which though it be stated by so very many <HI>Authors,</HI> and so fully too, as that some of them have written whole <HI>Treatises</HI> about it, so that one would think there should nothing <HI>material</HI> remain un∣said upon this <HI>Subject,</HI> Yet having seen in my travels great vari∣ety of <HI>Springs,</HI> and observed many particulars in this <HI>County</HI> relating to them perhaps altogether unknown, at least not minded by others; I make bold to produce them, since it must be of <HI>con∣cern</HI> that any thing can be added, to a <HI>Subject</HI> that has so fully been enlarg'd upon already.</P>

<P N="37">37. In the <HI>decision</HI> whereof, I think I may be <HI>peremptory</HI> that amongst the <HI>Springs</HI> that have no constant flux, those which in the <HI>Summer</HI> time are commonly dryed up, but after plentiful falls of <HI>rain,</HI> or competent <HI>moist weather,</HI> are constantly either <HI>profluent,</HI> or have a moderat <HI>stream;</HI> in short, that the <HI>temporary regular uncer∣tain</HI> Springs, must certainly depend on <HI>rains, dews,</HI> &amp;c. And I beleive most of those perennial <HI>Springs</HI> that are near the <HI>tops</HI> of <HI>Hills</HI> (whereof I have had the opportunity of viewing many) which I generally find to be but <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>weeping</HI> rather than <HI>runing,</HI> such as that upon the <HI>Bruff</HI> hill in the <HI>Parish</HI> of <HI>Mare,</HI> in all
<PB N="52" REF="41"/>probability too must either come from <HI>rains,</HI> or the <HI>mists</HI> that we see usualy hang on the <HI>Summits</HI> of them, when it is clear and dry weather below in the <HI>valleys:</HI> And not only these, but as <HI>Vitruvi∣us, Peter Martyr, Cardan, Molina, Bernard Palissy, Gassendus, Le Pere Iean Francois,</HI> and another <HI>Anonymus French Author,</HI> Printed at <HI>Paris An.</HI> 1674. Mr. <HI>Ray, Mr. Hook,</HI> &amp;c. are of opinion, all other <HI>Springs</HI> and <HI>runing waters</HI> whatever, owe their <HI>origine</HI> and <HI>continuation</HI> chiefly to <HI>rains, dews, &amp;c.</HI> The probability whereof they insinuat principally by the following <HI>reasons,</HI> which I shall here repeat as faithfully and as succinctly as may be.</P>
<P N="38">38. First because great inundations or overflowing of <HI>Rivers</HI> manifestly proceed either from the <HI>rain</HI> that immediatly falls, or from the melting of <HI>Snow</HI> or <HI>Ice</HI> that hath formerly fallen upon the more eminent parts of <HI>Mountains.</HI> 2, Because many <HI>Springs</HI> quite fail in dry <HI>Summers,</HI> and generally all <HI>abate</HI> considerably of their <HI>waters.</HI> 3, Because no <HI>Springs</HI> break out either on the <HI>top</HI> of a <HI>hill,</HI> or so near the <HI>top,</HI> but that there is always <HI>earth</HI> enough above them to afford a supply, considering the condition of high <HI>Mountains</HI> which are almost continually moistened with <HI>Clouds,</HI> and on which the <HI>Sun</HI> beams have but little force. 4, Because 'tis observed that there are no <HI>Springs</HI> rise in any <HI>plain,</HI> unless there be hills so near that one may reasonably conclude they are fed from thence. 5, Because in <HI>Clay Grounds</HI> into which <HI>water</HI> sinks with difficulty, we seldom find any <HI>Springs,</HI> whereas in sandy, gra∣velly, rocky, stony, or other <HI>grounds</HI> into which <HI>rain</HI> can easily make its way, we seldom fail of them. 6, Because we are assur∣ed by those that have experimented and calculated it, that <HI>commu∣nibus annis &amp; locis</HI> there falls water enough from the <HI>Heavens</HI> in actual <HI>rain, mists, dews, snow</HI> or <HI>hail,</HI> upon the surface of any <HI>Country,</HI> to supply all the water that runs into the <HI>Sea</HI> by the <HI>rivers</HI> of that <HI>Country.</HI> 7, Because they who would have <HI>Fountains</HI> to arise from, and to be continnually fed from the <HI>Sea,</HI> have not as yet given any satisfactory account,</P>
<P N="39">39. First, that there are any such <HI>Caverns</HI> or <HI>subterraneous pas∣sages</HI> in the <HI>Earth</HI> that come from the <HI>Sea;</HI> or 2. If there be, how water can ascend to the <HI>tops</HI> of <HI>Mountains</HI> and have its <HI>efflux</HI> there, since the <HI>Sea</HI> can have no such protuberances or elevated parts above the rest, as the <HI>earth</HI> ha's; and that no <HI>water</HI> will ascend above its owne <HI>Level.</HI> or 3, How the water (if from the <HI>Sea</HI>) should become thus <HI>fresh,</HI> since it seems so far from being done by <HI>transcolation,</HI> that it cannot be so done by <HI>distillation</HI> though fre∣quently repeated, but it will retain a <HI>brackish</HI> tast; for that <HI>sea∣water,</HI> as <HI>Varenius</HI> asserts, ha's a <HI>volatil</HI> as well as a <HI>fixt salt,</HI> which latter though it can be separated either by <HI>percolation</HI> or <HI>distillati∣on,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="41"/>yet the <HI>volatil</HI> cannot, it being so <HI>spirituous</HI> that it will ascend with the most <HI>rarifyed water.</HI> Nor 4. do they give any satisfacto∣ry account, why the <HI>passages</HI> through which these <HI>percolations</HI> are made (if the <HI>salt</HI> be continually left behind in them) are not long since stopt up with the <HI>salt</HI> that ha's perpetually been left behind in them from the begining of the <HI>World.</HI> Nor 5. why the <HI>Sea</HI> is not long before this become all <HI>fresh,</HI> since we cannot but suppose that the whole <HI>mass</HI> of <HI>water</HI> ha's once at least past through the body of the <HI>earth</HI> since the <HI>Creation</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> if not many more times than there are years since the <HI>begining,</HI> as those that do hold the contrary opinion do freely admit. And these are the chief <HI>reasons</HI> (nor are they slight ones) upon which the <HI>Authors</HI> above mention'd have grounded their <HI>opinion,</HI> which is the most applauded one too, and most universally received; in relation whereof I have been so far from <HI>abateing</HI> any thing of their <HI>strength,</HI> that I think I have proposed some of them with more advantage than the <HI>Authors</HI> themselves.</P>
<P N="40">40. And yet this opinion seems to be prest with more, and more insuperable <HI>difficulties</HI> than the other of <HI>Homer, Plato, Ari∣stotle, Virgil, Seneca, Pliny, the Philosophers</HI> of <HI>Conimbra, Scaliger, Dobrzenzki, Van Helmont, Lydiat, Pierre Davity, Des Cartes, Du Hamel, Le Pere Schottus, M. Jaques Rohault, Petrus Barbay,</HI> and the Reverend and Learned <HI>Dr. Stillingfleet Dean</HI> of St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> who all hold with little difference that some <HI>Springs</HI> at least are furnish't from other <HI>waters</HI> in the bowels of the <HI>Earth,</HI> which most of them agree too must be supplyed from the <HI>Sea</HI> by <HI>subterraneous passages,</HI> and that they are returned again thither by the <HI>Rindles, Brooks,</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> by the <HI>inferior Circulation:</HI> It is prest I say with far more inexplicable <HI>difficulties,</HI> than that of <HI>Homer, Plato,</HI> &amp;c. for beside that 'tis altogether unreasonable to admit that any of those <HI>temporary irregular Springs</HI> mention'd in the § § 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. of this <HI>Chapter,</HI> (considering their circumstances) should by any means possible come from <HI>rains, dews,</HI> &amp;c. though the waters they send forth indeed are but few and inconsiderable; it is alto∣gether as improbable (that I say not impossible) that the <HI>tempo∣rary regular periodical Springs</HI> should have their <HI>origine</HI> thence: for besides that they constantly observe their <HI>terms</HI> whether in <HI>wet</HI> or <HI>dry</HI> weather, some of them happen at least (if not so directed by some unknown secret operation of <HI>Nature</HI>) either to <HI>flow</HI> on∣ly in the dry <HI>Summer</HI> quarter, or to be most <HI>profluent</HI> then, though in an extream <HI>drought.</HI></P>

To the fift it may be answered, that the reason why we find few <HI>springs</HI> in stiff <HI>Clays,</HI> is not so much that <HI>rains</HI> cannot sinke into them, as that the <HI>springs</HI> cannot force themselves from below up through them, as the ingenious Mr. <HI>Young</HI> found it at <HI>Lipari</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Lecturae Cutlerianae de potentia Re∣stitut. <HI>p. 34.</HI></NOTE>, and as was further hinted in the bed of <HI>Chalk</HI> § 64 of this <HI>Chapter.</HI> And the <HI>Sixt</HI> seems to have been suffi∣ciently enervated <HI>Ibidem,</HI> in all the <HI>Paragraphes</HI> from the 56. to the 60<SUP>th</SUP>.</P>
<P N="80">80. Though it may be further added that the <HI>rains, Snows,</HI> &amp;c. are so far from supplying all the water that runs into the sea by the <HI>Rivers,</HI> that bateing what is spent in the nourishment of <HI>Plants;</HI> most, if not all the rest, is exhaled again into <HI>vapors</HI> for the supply of <HI>rains</HI> and <HI>dews;</HI> whence it is, that dry and barren <HI>Countries</HI> have but litle <HI>rain,</HI> and that the draining of <HI>bogs</HI> and <HI>fens,</HI> and cuting downe <HI>woods</HI> and <HI>groves</HI> (which cause the <HI>Air</HI> to stagnat, and so ingender moisture, and preserve it by their shade) will so alter the very temper of the <HI>Heavens,</HI> that the <HI>Country</HI> which before was cold and wet, shall become warme and temperatly dry. Thus <HI>Pliny</HI> tells us of old, that the <HI>Country</HI> about <HI>Philippi,</HI> being made dry by <HI>sluces,</HI> and artificial <HI>trenches,</HI> the whole disposition of the <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>weather</HI> was thereby altered, and the very <HI>habit</HI> of the <HI>heavens</HI> above their heads changed<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">C.

And thus we are credibly in∣formed that in our forreigne <HI>Plantations</HI> by destroying the <HI>woods,</HI> and laying all open to the <HI>sun,</HI> the <HI>rains</HI> are much abated, there being not half the <HI>rains</HI> now in <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> that there were hereto∣fore; and that the <HI>rains</HI> still diminish in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> as they extend

<P N="81">81. And lastly to the <HI>Seventh</HI> and its several branches, viz. that those who would have the <HI>fountains</HI> supplyed from the <HI>Sea,</HI> have not satisfyed the world, <HI>first</HI> that there are such <HI>Caverns</HI> or <HI>subterraneous passages</HI> that come from it; I think I may safely say they have had full satisfaction from §§. 67.68.69.70.71 and 72 above written. And to the <HI>second,</HI> that if such <HI>Caverns</HI> should be allowed, it does not yet appear, how water should a∣scend to the <HI>tops</HI> of <HI>Mountains,</HI> &amp;c. I answer first, that in case it should be admitted, that the <HI>Sea,</HI> can have no such elevated parts, as to be the cause of any <HI>Spring</HI> on the <HI>top</HI> of a <HI>Mountain,</HI> yet this hinders not but it may be of those in the <HI>Ʋalleys</HI> (these being as much below the surface of the sea, as the <HI>Mountains</HI> are above it) which is as much as we contend for, it having been readily granted §. 37 that the <HI>Springs</HI> on, or near the <HI>tops</HI> of <HI>hills,</HI> if weak and weeping, may proceed from <HI>rains:</HI> But indeed if such as those mention'd § 77 (especially that from the <HI>rock</HI> in the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> which cannot well be supposed to come from <HI>rains</HI>) be intended in the <HI>argument,</HI> the case is more difficult, and requires <HI>secondly</HI> a more strict and direct answer; for if all <HI>water</HI> compose it self to a <HI>Level,</HI> above which it will never ascend in a <HI>Tube</HI> or other passage, how it should thus be conveyed to the <HI>tops</HI> of <HI>Mountains,</HI> is a <HI>Que∣stion</HI> indeed worthy of <HI>Solution:</HI> which yet we find not so insu∣perable, but that it may be said,</P>
<P N="82">82. First, that notwithstanding it is true, that <HI>water</HI> continuing in an equal state, and vessel, ascends not naturally above its owne <HI>Le∣vel;</HI> yet that when there is an unequal weight between the water descending and the water ascending, as there is between the <HI>salt water</HI> of the <HI>sea,</HI> and the <HI>fresh</HI> of <HI>fountains;</HI> the former descending in <HI>large passages,</HI> and the latter ascending in <HI>tapering Tubes,</HI> dimi∣nishing into <HI>capillaries;</HI> the <HI>sea water</HI> being presst too with a vast weight of <HI>Air</HI> which is always incumbent upon its spacious super∣ficies: I see no reason (these circumstances being well weighed) but that such water may well ascend above its owne <HI>Level,</HI> so far as to issue forth from the <HI>top</HI> of the highest <HI>Mountain;</HI> just as the <HI>Quicksilver</HI> ascends in the <HI>Tube</HI> of a <HI>Barometer</HI> by the pressure of the <HI>Air</HI> upon the stagnant poole of <HI>Mercury</HI> below. To which 2. let me add the great assistance afforded toward the performance of this work, by the constant <HI>heat</HI> in the lower <HI>Regions</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> which warming the streames as they run along, there are continually riseing some <HI>vapors,</HI> or little particles of water which
<PB N="80" REF="57"/>nimbly pass through the <HI>pores</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> till they come toward its <HI>superficies</HI> in the <HI>Caverns</HI> of the <HI>Mountains,</HI> which being invi∣roned with <HI>cold,</HI> these <HI>vapors</HI> are there condensed again into <HI>perfect water</HI> as in the head of a <HI>Cucurbit</HI> or <HI>Still;</HI> and as <HI>Des Car∣tes</HI> and Dr. <HI>Stllingfleet</HI> learnedly observe, being now more <HI>gross,</HI> cannot descend again through the same <HI>pores,</HI> through which they ascended when <HI>vapors</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ren.

<P N="92">92. And to the <HI>fourth</HI> branch of the same <HI>Argument,</HI> which requires satisfaction, why the <HI>passages</HI> through which these <HI>percola∣tions</HI> have been made from the beginning of the <HI>world,</HI> are not long since stopt up? it may briefly be answered that in all probability they are so far from being stopt, that 'tis next to certainty that they dayly grow wider; it being found by sad experience amongst <HI>Seamen,</HI> who when they want <HI>fresh water,</HI> sometimes percolate <HI>salt water</HI> through a <HI>Tub</HI> of <HI>Sand</HI> or <HI>earth,</HI> that though at first the water comes tolerably <HI>fresh,</HI> yet upon repeated transcolations, the <HI>passa∣ges</HI> grow so <HI>enlarged,</HI> that at last it comes forth again but little alter'd: Whence we cannot but conclude these <HI>passages</HI> in the <HI>Sea</HI> (where the great <HI>Voragines</HI> are) must needs by this time be so ve∣ry large, that they are altogether unlikely to be any way stopt: Yet granting they should; there is no <HI>salt,</HI> and but little <HI>Earth</HI> of so close a texture, but it will admit of percolation: Some few <HI>Clays</HI> in∣deed there are, and some other <HI>Earths</HI> perhaps there may be, whose parts are so <HI>fast</HI> and <HI>united</HI> that nothing will pass through them, nor is there any necessity it should, for few of these <HI>indraughts</HI> here and there intersperst, will (and I suppose doe) serve for this pur∣pose; whence it is that <HI>Springs,</HI> as the learned Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> very well observes, are not indifferently every where to be found, but only in the paticular <HI>channels</HI> wherein they are included like the <HI>blood</HI> in an <HI>Animal,</HI> which if prick't in some parts sends forth <HI>blood</HI> immediatly, but if the <HI>incision</HI> happen between the <HI>sinews,</HI> or in the

Thus if you <HI>dig</HI> in some places incredibly <HI>deep,</HI> you shall hardly meet with <HI>water,</HI> whereas at another, though but a <HI>coyts</HI> cast distant, you shall find it plentifully, and near the <HI>day</HI> too; whereof I have met with several considerable <HI>instances</HI> in <HI>this</HI> and other <HI>Countries;</HI> particularly that at <HI>Barlaston</HI> near <HI>New castle</HI> under <HI>Lyme</HI> is very remarkable, where in the <HI>South Chancell</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> belonging to the worthy Mr. <HI>John Bagnal,</HI> there rises a <HI>Spring</HI> whenever they have occasion to dig a <HI>grave</HI> (notwithstanding it is always shelter'd from <HI>rains</HI>) that quickly fills it with wa∣ter; whereas if they dig in any other part of the <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>Church∣yard</HI> round about it, they find the <HI>Earth</HI> as dry as in most other <HI>places;</HI> whereof the same Mr. <HI>Bagnal</HI> gave me a very cogent though uncomfortable <HI>Testimony</HI> from his owne <HI>Well</HI> hard by, which though 22 yards deep, had scarce any water in it in <HI>winter,</HI> much less in <HI>Summer.</HI> Thus at <HI>Tetnall</HI> also in <HI>Staffordshire</HI> upon the <HI>Hill</HI> above the <HI>Church,</HI> the <HI>Springs</HI> rise within 3 yards of the surface, whereas the <HI>Wells</HI> near the <HI>Church</HI> 20 yards <HI>below,</HI> are all betwixt 20 and 30 yards deep; so that the Springs on the <HI>Hill,</HI> lye at least 40 yards higher than those in the <HI>Vale,</HI> though they are not di∣stant above 200 yards. So at <HI>Longdon</HI> as well within the <HI>Church</HI> as <HI>Churchyard,</HI> though upon higher ground, the <HI>Springs</HI> lye so <HI>near,</HI> that many times the <HI>Coffins</HI> are cover'd with <HI>water,</HI> when they put them in their <HI>Graves;</HI> whereas at the <HI>Parsonage</HI> House that stands on a much lower ground, and but just without the <HI>Church∣yard</HI> wall, the well is 30 yards deep at least, and sometimes wants <HI>water.</HI> And in the Church and Churchyard of St. Michael at <HI>Lich∣field,</HI> is found the same thing, though the Church stand on the ve∣ry summit of a Hill (the ground falling every way from it) and that no small one neither.</P>
<P N="94">94. But the most eminent <HI>Instance</HI> of this kind, that ever I met with in all my <HI>Travells,</HI> is at <HI>Blounts Court</HI> in the <HI>Parish</HI> of <HI>Rotherfield Pypard</HI> in the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Oxon:</HI> where though they dug a <HI>Well</HI> on one side of the <HI>House</HI> (as I received the account from that great <HI>Encourager</HI> of all ingenious designes, the Worshipfull Tho. <HI>Stonor</HI> of <HI>Stonor</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR><HI>Proprietor</HI> of the Place) above 60 yards deep, yet could procure no <HI>water,</HI> it remaining a dry <HI>well</HI> to this day, 48 yards deep, 12 yards and upwards being since fill'd up with <HI>Timber</HI> and other <HI>Rubbish</HI> thrown into it; whereupon attempting another but on the other side the House, 43 yards di∣stant, upon higher ground, they found so plentifull a <HI>spring</HI> at 15 foot deep, that it sometimes stands (as the forecited worthy <HI>Gent.</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="60"/>lately sent me word) 12 foot deep in water, though situat in a high, fast, &amp; stony <HI>Country.</HI> Nor is the <HI>water</HI> of <HI>springs</HI> only conveyed in particular <HI>Channels,</HI> but as the <HI>blood</HI> in the <HI>veins</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> also <HI>ascends</HI> in them, whereof we have a very remarkable <HI>inflance</HI> at <HI>Tixall</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> where the <HI>Spring</HI> near the <HI>Church,</HI> which serves the <HI>Towne</HI> whith <HI>water,</HI> has been sometimes exsiccated, (as I was infor∣med by the learned and observing Gent. <HI>Walter Chetwynd</HI> of <HI>Ingestre</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>) when the right Honorable <HI>Walter</HI> Lord <HI>Aston</HI> has had occasion to cleanse some of the <HI>ditches</HI> in his <HI>grounds</HI> below, be∣twixt the <HI>River</HI> and the <HI>Towne,</HI> the <HI>water</HI> being thereby intercepted in the way, which could by no means be, unless the <HI>water</HI> did <HI>as∣cend</HI> thence, in such <HI>ductus's</HI> or <HI>channels</HI> up to the <HI>Towne.</HI></P>
<P N="95">95.

That each of them have, not one, but many <HI>Inlets;</HI> the first that receives the <HI>Many∣fold</HI> being near <HI>Wetton</HI> Mill, and the first that swallows <HI>Hamps</HI> a little below the water Houses, on the <HI>River</HI> side betwixt <HI>Waterfall</HI> and <HI>Cauldon;</HI> both of them, when they swell so high that the first will not receive them, having divers others below at no great dis∣tances
<PB N="89" REF="61"/>that usually doe it all the <HI>Summer.</HI> 2. That though for the most part they run under ground all the <HI>Summer,</HI> yet they doe not so in <HI>Winter;</HI> for when their <HI>waters</HI> are so high, that all the <HI>Inlets</HI> will not suffice to <HI>swallow</HI> them, then they have <HI>Channels</HI> (which lye dry all the <HI>Summer</HI>) wherein like other <HI>Rivers</HI> they are conveyed above ground meeting near <HI>Beeston Torr,</HI> about ½ a Mile North of <HI>Throwley,</HI> and so runing on to <HI>Ilam,</HI> joyning the <HI>Dove</HI> a little be∣low, North of <HI>Blore</HI> Park. And 3. though in <HI>Summer</HI> they fall in∣to the <HI>ground</HI> at 2 miles distance, yet as above in <HI>Winter,</HI> so below in <HI>Summer,</HI> they joyne again somewhere under the great <HI>Hills</HI> through which they pass; for we find but one <HI>exit</HI> for them both, which is a little below Mr. <HI>Ports</HI> House near <HI>Ilam</HI> Church; unless we shall rather say, that either, or both of them, never come forth again at all, and that the <HI>Spring</HI> at <HI>Ilam</HI> may have no dependance on them; which may be easily tryed, were <HI>Feathers</HI> thrown into the <HI>water</HI> at the <HI>Indraught</HI> of one, and <HI>Chaff</HI> (or some other agree∣able materialls) at the other: But having no opportunity of mak∣ing the <HI>Experiment</HI> my self, I recommend it to the ingenious <HI>Charles Cotton</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and the worthy <HI>Mr. Port,</HI> next neighbours to them, who joyntly may try it with little trouble.</P>
<P N="98">98. Beside, there is a <HI>Rivulet</HI> comeing from West of <HI>Broughton</HI> Chappel, and runing by <HI>Fair-oak,</HI> that two meddows below the houses, falls into the <HI>ground</HI> within <HI>Blore</HI> Park, belonging to the right Reverend the Lord <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> which but two Med∣dows beyond, rises again under a slat stone before it comes to <HI>Blore Pipe:</HI> This 'tis true is but inconsiderable, it being but a small <HI>Rindle,</HI> and runing <HI>underground</HI> but a little way, and not very deep; yet the greatest <HI>flood</HI> (as I was told) never causing it to run above ground, as <HI>Hamps</HI> and <HI>Manyfold</HI> doe, I thought it worth menti∣oning. To which let me add some other such <HI>waters,</HI> which though not constant, yet in all <HI>Landfloods</HI> run violently from the <HI>Hills,</HI> and are received below into rocky <HI>subterraneous</HI> passages, whereof there are two under <HI>Cauldon Low,</HI> but whither they con∣vey the <HI>water</HI> no man knows; and there is another such <HI>Indraught</HI> at the foot of <HI>Ribden</HI> that also swallows the <HI>Land floods,</HI> which 'tis believed come out again at <HI>Criftage,</HI> but not certain; however it be, the <HI>water</HI> that comes from <HI>Criftage,</HI> certainly falls in under a <HI>rock</HI> at the foot of <HI>Reeden,</HI> and what becomes of it after, no man knowes: of which no more, but that <HI>Ribden, Reeden</HI> &amp;c. under which these <HI>Cryptae</HI> lye, are Hills between <HI>Ramsor</HI> and <HI>Pantons</HI> in the <HI>Dale.</HI> Nor have I more to add concerning <HI>Rivers or Rivulets</HI> but that the <HI>Manyfold</HI> is fuller of <HI>windeings</HI> (whence doubtless it has its name) than <HI>Maeander</HI> it self, if its turnings are no where thicker than about <HI>Palatsha,</HI> whereof the learned and ingenious

<PB N="91" REF="62"/>Gower's</HI> at <HI>Trentham</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> I found several <HI>Frogs,</HI> in the <HI>Fountain</HI> in the <HI>Garden</HI> lying dead at the bottom of the <HI>Bason,</HI> and the fleshy parts of most of them so consumed that there was nothing left but the <HI>Skeletons</HI> of them; the <HI>Cartilaginious</HI> parts of the <HI>head</HI> &amp;c. in some of them yet remaining, but in others quite consumed; which comparing with the <HI>bones,</HI> I had from <HI>Tene,</HI> I not only found them to be <HI>frogs</HI> bones, but also quickly apprehended the whole <HI>process</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> in the manage of the <HI>business,</HI> viz. that <HI>Frogs</HI> in <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Aug.</HI> being in a declining condition, doe creep into such <HI>Ca∣verns</HI> of <HI>rocks,</HI> as whence this <HI>Spring</HI> comes, and are there kill'd by the excessive <HI>coldness</HI> of the <HI>water;</HI> and not only their <HI>fleshy</HI> but <HI>gristley</HI> parts too, there consumed as soon at least as the <HI>liga∣ments</HI> that hold the <HI>leg</HI> and <HI>rib</HI> bones together, which are the only <HI>parts</HI> solid enough to resist the <HI>dissolving power</HI> of the <HI>water:</HI> Whence it is that we meet only with <HI>these</HI> at the mouth of the <HI>Spring,</HI> and no <HI>others,</HI> brought out by the violence of the <HI>water,</HI> and in the most plentifull manner about the <HI>fall</HI> of the <HI>leaf,</HI> quickly after the <HI>death</HI> and <HI>dissolution</HI> of these <HI>Animals;</HI> which being taken away, there come forth gradually <HI>fewer</HI> every <HI>Month</HI> all the <HI>year</HI> after, the whole <HI>stock</HI> being usually spent about 2 <HI>Months</HI> before the return of the <HI>year,</HI> which is the occasion that there are none, or very few, to be found there in the <HI>Months</HI> of <HI>Iuly</HI> and <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P N="101">101. Another sort of <HI>Springs</HI> I have met with in this <HI>County,</HI> that have this yet more surprizing <HI>Quality</HI> with them; that though they are all <HI>cold,</HI> yet never will <HI>freez</HI> in the hardest weather; such is the <HI>Spring</HI> that feeds the <HI>Millpool</HI> at <HI>Overholm</HI> near <HI>Leek,</HI> and the <HI>Spring</HI> which serves the <HI>Mill</HI> at <HI>Tittensor,</HI> whence it is that the <HI>Mills</HI> of both those places, never fail of goeing in the <HI>seve∣rest frosts:</HI> There are <HI>Springs</HI> also about <HI>Hynts</HI> that doe not <HI>freez,</HI> nor will the standing <HI>pooles</HI> that have these <HI>Springs</HI> in them: Thus <HI>Clayers pool</HI> in the Corner of the <HI>Park</HI> at <HI>Enfield</HI> never <HI>freezes</HI> in the hardest winter, being fed by a <HI>Spring</HI> (comeing out of a spout) called <HI>Shadwell,</HI> under which though cold (as I was seriously in∣form'd by a very worthy person) if you set a vessel of water <HI>frozen,</HI> it will certainly <HI>thaw</HI> it.

<PB N="95" REF="66"/>six houres, and is performed gradually, the <HI>Salt-workers</HI> getting first about two <HI>bushells</HI> or <HI>Barrows</HI> full, then by a gentle fire they corne it again, in half an hour, for the three first pair of <HI>Barrows,</HI> but afterwards not under an hour, the <HI>brine</HI> being then thinner, and the <HI>Pan</HI> cooler: They doe not evaporate all the brine out of the <HI>Pan,</HI> but leave some in the bottom towards the next <HI>filling;</HI> which together with the addition of the <HI>Leach brine,</HI> heightens the weak liquor, and much advances and facilitates the follow∣ing <HI>operation.</HI> After the <HI>Barrows</HI> are fully drained, they are remo∣ved into the <HI>hot-house,</HI> behind the <HI>Saltern</HI> to dry, and are set over the brick conveyance of the flame from under the <HI>Pans</HI> to the tun∣nel of the <HI>Chimney</HI> (which passage for that purpose is made about six or seven yards long) where after they have continued for 24 hours, the <HI>Salt</HI> will become so dry, that it is fit for carriage, or publick sale.</P>
<P N="107">107. And this is the tedious process of making of <HI>Salt</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> which though much more chargeable than in <HI>Worcestershire</HI> or <HI>Cheshire,</HI> where they spend not ordinarily above half the <HI>time</HI> or <HI>fire</HI> (nor need they above a quarter) of what the great quantity of <HI>brine</HI> they must use here, necessarily requires for its <HI>evaporation;</HI> yet its being always clarifyed with <HI>Eggs,</HI> and not with <HI>bullocks blood,</HI> as it is most commonly in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> which gives the <HI>Salt</HI> an ill colour and savour; and its being better cleared from <HI>Sand</HI> by long <HI>boiling</HI> than either <HI>Cheshire</HI> or <HI>Worcestershire Salts</HI> are; have given it such a reputation amongst considering Men, that the <HI>Ʋndertaker</HI> is incouraged still to prosecute the <HI>work:</HI> Which perhaps might be improved to better advantage, were the <HI>brine</HI> either ripen'd on <HI>Clay</HI> before <HI>boyling,</HI> or <HI>laved</HI> on <HI>hovels</HI> cover'd with <HI>Mats,</HI> made of reeds straw or flaggs, as they serve a weak brine they have at <HI>Halle</HI> in <HI>Saxony;</HI> which by being <HI>ventilated</HI> in the <HI>Air,</HI> and <HI>percolated</HI> through the <HI>Mats,</HI> as we are assured by the Honorable <HI>Robert Boyle</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mr Collins's discourse of Salt and Fishery. <HI>p. 7.</HI></NOTE> is so beneficially exhaled and enrich't by the <HI>Sun,</HI> that were ours served so, no doubt a great part of the Expence of <HI>coales</HI> (if not <HI>time</HI>) might be saved.</P>

<P N="109">109.

<P N="110">110. Yet notwithstanding this <HI>Experiment,</HI> upon further <HI>tryal,</HI> they had good grounds given them strongly to suspect, that the <HI>sand</HI> must needs be in the <HI>brine</HI> before, and not produced in the <HI>boiling;</HI> For having carefully observed it with an excellent <HI>Micro∣scope</HI> before they <HI>strained</HI> it, though they mist of the <HI>sand,</HI> yet they found (what they expected not) a great multitude of very <HI>minute Animals</HI> (much smaller than those that are in <HI>pepper</HI> water) swim∣ing about in it, and withall a very many small transparent <HI>plates,</HI> some of them a little bigger, and some less than the <HI>insects,</HI> and all of them of a rectangular oblong figure: Yet both <HI>these</HI> and the <HI>Animalcules</HI> so very <HI>small,</HI> that they all pa'st through the <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Cambrick</HI> though of 16 folds. For viewing the <HI>brine</HI> again after it was <HI>strane d,</HI> they found them swiming as thick in it then, as before: But at this they did not wonder, because the <HI>pores</HI> of the <HI>Holland</HI> did appear in the <HI>Microscope</HI> (though it was extreamly <HI>fine</HI>) to be
<PB N="97" REF="67"/>at least twenty times greater than either the <HI>Animalcules</HI> or <HI>plates;</HI> yet these they judged to be the component particles both of the <HI>Sand</HI> and <HI>Salt,</HI> which as the brine exhaled in <HI>boiling,</HI> only gather'd together, and made greater cornes of each.</P>
<P N="111">111. Wherein they were confirmed by looking with the <HI>Micro∣scope</HI> upon some of the <HI>strong brine</HI> that dropt from the <HI>Barrows</HI> when the <HI>Salt</HI> was first put in, which appearing full of those <HI>oblong particles,</HI> as they looked upon them they could sensibly perceive them to <HI>gather together,</HI> and <HI>club</HI> to make greater bodies, till at last they appear'd as the water dryed off the <HI>glass,</HI> as bigg and not unlike a large <HI>Table-diamond:</HI> Which made them think that the <HI>Sand</HI> too, might probably be produced after the same manner, it being very <HI>white,</HI> and seeming nothing else to them (pardon the expression) but an <HI>insipid Salt,</HI> whose parts are not so sharp and pointed as the other, but rounder and blunter, and consequently not so <HI>pungent</HI> on the <HI>Tongue.</HI> To clear which point I endeavourd to dissolve some of the <HI>sand</HI> again in <HI>fair water,</HI> to see whether I could discover any of its <HI>principles,</HI> but without <HI>success,</HI> the parts of the <HI>Sand</HI> being so inseparably <HI>fixt</HI> that it would by no means dissolve; I also tryed the <HI>Salt,</HI> which though it <HI>dissolved,</HI> yet would not render it self again into <HI>plates:</HI> so that I can only add, that as it seems to be pretty certain that the <HI>Salt</HI> is made out of the <HI>oblong plates,</HI> so it is very agreeable to the <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> in the production of the gravelly <HI>Caddis-houses</HI> in the <HI>Nat.

The <HI>water</HI> of this <HI>well</HI> is much clearer then that at <HI>In∣gestre,</HI> and yet is most certainly sated with <HI>sulphureous</HI> particles; for about 40 or 50 years since, some <HI>persons</HI> hereabout curious of knowing whence such <HI>waters</HI> should come, both dug and boared the ground near adjoyning, and met with a sort of <HI>mineral</HI> Earth that crash't in the boaring (as some of the described it) like <HI>rot∣ten wood;</HI> which being carryed to <HI>London</HI> was found <HI>sulphureous,</HI> and I suppose must needs be the <HI>native sulphur,</HI> depauperated of its richest particles by the incisive <HI>atoms</HI> of the <HI>Salt,</HI> and left so <HI>spun∣gy</HI> that (as some of them told me) it would <HI>swim</HI> on the <HI>water.</HI> This water was accounted in ancient times (when <HI>Leprosies</HI> were frequent) a soveraign <HI>Remedy</HI> for such as were troubled with that foule distemper, for whose better accommodation, there was a <HI>house</HI> built near it, which retains to this day the name of the <HI>Leper-house;</HI> and is in use at present against <HI>Scabs</HI> and <HI>Itch,</HI> both in <HI>Man</HI> and <HI>Beast,</HI> purging both by <HI>Seige</HI> and <HI>urin,</HI> and not only raking the body within, but most effectually driving forth all ill <HI>humors;</HI> It also sometimes <HI>vomits</HI> according to the constitution of the <HI>Patient:</HI> They commonly drink about 3 quarts at a time, less scarce work∣ing; except by <HI>vomit,</HI> where it meets with weak stomacks. The <HI>Inhabitants</HI> hereabout brew their drink with this <HI>water,</HI> especially
<PB N="102" REF="70"/>at that they call the <HI>Brimstone Alehouse;</HI> and boyle their meat with it; upon which 'tis observed, that none of them are ever troubled either with <HI>Scabs</HI> or <HI>Itch,</HI> or such like <HI>Cuticular</HI> diseases.</P>
<P N="121">121. But the <HI>water</HI> that carrys with it the most rectifyed <HI>Sul∣phur</HI> is that of the <HI>well</HI> in <HI>Willowbridg</HI> Park, it being hardly visible in the <HI>water</HI> it self, which appears (not like others) of a <HI>yellow,</HI> but a clear <HI>Chrystalline</HI> colour, only on the sides of the <HI>glasses,</HI> af∣ter they have been used a while, one my perceive (with good at∣tention) a bright <HI>oilyness,</HI> which is so <HI>volatile</HI> that upon <HI>distilla∣tion</HI> it came over before the <HI>water,</HI> as <HI>volatile Spirits</HI> do, and then (being embodyed) was of a <HI>bright yellow:</HI> to which putting a few drops of solution of <HI>sublimat,</HI> it presently turned of a deep <HI>Sack-colour,</HI> whereby it seemed like the other <HI>waters</HI> (the <HI>Salt</HI> being rebated by the viscosity of the <HI>Sulphur</HI>) to have somewhat of a <HI>Lixiviat Salt</HI> with it; but so very weak, that it made this deep <HI>yellow</HI> instead of the <HI>Orange tauny</HI> precipitat. Upon which account it was too (that like the other <HI>Sulphur waters</HI>) it <HI>latherd</HI> well with <HI>Soap,</HI> would not turn <HI>milk,</HI> nor would the <HI>crude water</HI> with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Violets</HI> turn either of the <HI>red</HI> or <HI>green</HI> colour, though we know there is an <HI>acid</HI> in it, that puts on the Nature of an <HI>Alcali;</HI> Nor could I procure the least signe of any <HI>Salt,</HI> though I evaporated divers <HI>Gallons</HI> of it away, so subtile are the <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>sulphur,</HI> where∣with this <HI>water</HI> is impregnated.</P>
<P N="122">122. The <HI>crude water</HI> indeed would answer to <HI>nothing</HI> but the infusion of solution of <HI>saccharum Saturni,</HI> which inclined me to think it of the same <HI>nature</HI> with the <HI>sulphur water</HI> of <HI>Ingestre,</HI> only impregnated with much finer and more subtile <HI>steams;</HI> though the effect in <HI>this</HI> was quite different from <HI>that:</HI> for instead of precipi∣tating the <HI>sulphureous</HI> particles, this only turned the whole body of the <HI>water,</HI> first of much such a <HI>blew-yellowish</HI> colour as is made by the infusion of the chips or shaving of <HI>Nephritic wood</HI> in com∣mon water, which after a while faded into a <HI>muddy white.</HI> A <HI>Phae∣nomenon</HI> I must confess much more unaccountable, than the means whereby it <HI>cures</HI> so many <HI>diseases,</HI> which most certainly it perfor∣mes by its <HI>balsamic virtue,</HI> and great <HI>subtilty</HI> and <HI>volatility,</HI> easily permeating the closest <HI>texture,</HI> and most unaccessible parts of the <HI>body,</HI> when once heated by the <HI>stomack</HI> if taken <HI>inwardly,</HI> or but by the external heat of the <HI>skin</HI> if applyed <HI>outwardly</HI> by way of <HI>Bath;</HI> for so sensible is it of the least <HI>heat</HI> (as I plainly saw in <HI>distilling</HI> it in a <HI>glass body</HI> and <HI>head</HI>) that its <HI>oil</HI> or <HI>sulphur</HI> came over the <HI>Helm</HI> upon the first <HI>heat,</HI> and was all in the <HI>Recipient</HI> before the least drop of <HI>water</HI> appear'd.

In digging all sorts of <HI>coal</HI> (that appears not to the <HI>day,</HI> as the <HI>Miners</HI> speak) after the Soil or arable, and the gravel, Sand, grit, and clays are removed, which keep no course; all the <HI>Bass, Freestone</HI> (of what sort soever) <HI>Clunches, Bats,</HI> and <HI>Partings</HI> lye one above another, and keep a regular course; wherein the things most observable are their <HI>rise, croping</HI> or <HI>basseting;</HI> their <HI>diping;</HI> and the <HI>row or streek;</HI> which after the <HI>Species</HI> or sorts of <HI>coal,</HI> were the next things proposed to our consideration. In the hand∣ling whereof I must first acquaint the <HI>Reader,</HI> that <HI>coal</HI> generally in this, as in all other <HI>Countrys,</HI> lyes in the earth obliquely i. e. neither in <HI>plano Horizontis,</HI> nor <HI>perpendicular;</HI> but <HI>riseing</HI> one way toward the surface of the Earth, till it comes within a foot or two, some∣times a yard or more, of the <HI>superficies,</HI> which the workmen in this Country generally call <HI>basseting,</HI> others <HI>croping;</HI> and <HI>diping</HI> into the earth the other way so deep, that it is seldom or never followed to the end, or indeed any thing near it (except where a Mine <HI>lips</HI> or <HI>crops</HI> up again, as sometimes it does, as well in the <HI>dip</HI> as the <HI>row</HI>) by reason the <HI>Workmen</HI> are either prevented by waters, or too deep a draught. This <HI>basseting,</HI> and <HI>diping</HI> of <HI>coal</HI> is various, sometimes greater and sometimes less, sometimes approaching to a <HI>perpendi∣cular,</HI> cutting the <HI>superficies</HI> almost at <HI>right angles,</HI> which sort they call a <HI>rearing Mine,</HI> whereof I was told there was one at <HI>Biddulph</HI> that runs down <HI>perpendicularly.</HI> Others are again that come so near to a <HI>plane</HI> of the <HI>Horizon</HI> that they dip not above one foot in 10, 20 or sometimes 30 foot: these they call <HI>flat Mines</HI> by reason of their even and almost level course. The <HI>open works</HI> at <HI>Wednesbury</HI> seem to be of this kind, where there being but little earth lying o∣ver the <HI>measures</HI> of <HI>coal,</HI> the <HI>VVorkmen</HI> rid off the earth, and dig the coal under their feet and carry it out in wheel-barrows, there being no need for these, of <HI>windless, roap,</HI> or <HI>carf,</HI> whence these sort of <HI>Coale-works</HI> are commonly call'd <HI>Foot-ridds,</HI> or <HI>Footrills.</HI></P>

<PB N="130" REF="90"/>more common <HI>hanging mines,</HI> in which they are forc't to follow the <HI>coal</HI> to a great depth, to be at the expence and labour of draw∣ing all up by hand, and sometimes of freeing the <HI>Mine</HI> from water, both which are saved in this sort of <HI>hanging Mine,</HI> as well as in the <HI>flat open works.</HI> And that yet they fall short of the <HI>latter,</HI> in regard it is a long time (if ever) in these, before the <HI>Colliers</HI> can reach so far forward as to be hinderd in their work either by want of <HI>Air</HI> or any long draught, and so are longer workable; whereas the <HI>former</HI> riseing with the <HI>Hill</HI> (though 'tis true they may work a vast way forward) before they want <HI>Air,</HI> yet haveing but one way to work beside <HI>viz.</HI> by making <HI>setings up</HI> with the <HI>croping</HI> of the <HI>coal,</HI> they must work out at last, and cannot hold on so long, as where they may work every way round them, and perhaps further forward than the others can too.</P>
<P N="38">38 However these are as preferable to other <HI>hanging Mines,</HI> as those are to the <HI>rearing ones,</HI> which are the worst of all: the <HI>Colliers</HI> quickly reaching to their utmost workable depth every way; though it must not be denyed but that the <HI>coal</HI> of these, and the common <HI>hanging Mines,</HI> is most times more firm, and better for burning, than that of the others; it being certainly true as well in <HI>coal</HI> as <HI>stone,</HI> that the deeper it is fetch't the harder and better; and the nearer they come to the surface, the softer and worse; till at last they are con∣verted, if <HI>stone,</HI> most commonly to a little better than <HI>sand;</HI> and if <HI>coal,</HI> to a <HI>shale, smut,</HI> or <HI>dross,</HI> that will not burn. Which is all I could hear of concerning the <HI>rise</HI> and <HI>diping</HI> of <HI>coal;</HI> but that some∣times it will alter its <HI>dip</HI> to a <HI>rise,</HI> and <HI>crop</HI> to the same point of the compass it <HI>dipt</HI> before, which the <HI>Workmen</HI> call <HI>leaping.</HI> Nay so sportive sometimes does <HI>nature</HI> seem to be in this matter, that the <HI>coal</HI> which has <HI>cropt</HI> to the same point of its first <HI>diping,</HI> as in the foremention'd example; before it has reach't the surface and <HI>cropt</HI> out, has taken another <HI>dip</HI> agreeable to the first, and then again another <HI>crop</HI> agreeable to the former; but these are but <HI>rarities</HI> not often to be met with.</P>

</LIST> All which, whether <HI>super</HI> or <HI>subterraneal,</HI> I take in general to pro∣ceed from stagnations in the subterranel Vaults of the Earth, for want of due Ventilations, and commerce betweene the <HI>inferior</HI> and <HI>superior</HI> Air. The <HI>material</HI> causes 'tis true may be various, either simple or compound: as the meer corruption of the simple Air alone upon a long stagnation in the Coal-rooms, and the rifts and clefts of the rock of coal it self, may be its <HI>material</HI> cause indeed, but the <HI>causa sine qua non</HI> of such a damp, I take to be the want of mo∣tion in those cavities, without which, the <HI>Air</HI> would never have corrupted; no more than <HI>water</HI> which never corrupts till it stag∣nates,
<PB N="134" REF="92"/>when indeed like the <HI>Air</HI> it becomes poysonous, though possib∣ly not to that degree, the <HI>Air</HI> being a body much finer, and convey∣ed to the more tender parts of the body.</P>
<P N="43">43. Whence it is that in the old <HI>works,</HI> wherein there has been no digging for a long time, no laveing, drawing, or pumping of water, all which keep the <HI>Air</HI> in motion, and the <HI>water</HI> from canckering, these <HI>damps</HI> are most frequent and most dangerous. Whence it is too that the <HI>Works</HI> where the bed of coal is thin, and admits of but few or no such rifts or clefts for the <HI>Air</HI> to stagnat or corrupt in, are seldom or never troubled with them. Upon which account 'tis likewise that though a bed of coal have many of these rifts, and large ones too; yet as long as there is a profluence of <HI>water</HI> through them, there is no danger of their entertaining such <HI>damps;</HI> which as soon as made dry by a <HI>Sough</HI> or <HI>free-Level,</HI> the same <HI>Mine</HI> shall become much more lyable to them; the wholsom <HI>Air</HI> that was in them whilst kept in motion by the <HI>flux</HI> of the <HI>water</HI> (having little or no communication with that above ground) now stagnating and corrupting to that degree, that it not only extinguishes the glowing heat of coales, and the flame of candles, torches &amp;c. but the <HI>flam∣mula vitae</HI> too in most living creatures, so that the <HI>Animal</HI> which respires it, some times expires with it too. And as it is in <HI>simple damps</HI> made out of corrupted <HI>Air</HI> only, so it is in the compound ones of one or more <HI>minerals,</HI> whether visible or invisible; whether ariseing from the <HI>smoak</HI> of <HI>coale</HI> it selfe, or as some will have one of them, from the <HI>scent</HI> of <HI>vegetables,</HI> or 2 from the steams of the <HI>Work∣mens</HI> breath, and sweat of their bodies, together with the smoak of the candles they work by; or 3 from sulphureous, arsenical, ni∣trous, or other such <HI>mineral</HI> steams that may be incident to <HI>Coal∣works:</HI> for to all these they ascribe a particular sort of <HI>Damp.</HI></P>
<P N="44">44. The first sort whereof, which arises from the <HI>smoak</HI> of <HI>coal</HI> it self, is said to happen only in such <HI>grooves</HI> where they make use of great fires to soften the rocks to make them yeild to the pick-Axe, which sending up with the <HI>smoak</HI> a sulphureous or perhaps an ar∣senical vapour, in probability may so infect the quiet Air in such deep caverns, as to render it unfit for respiration: it haveing been long indeed observed that such <HI>mines</HI> are seldom or never free from <HI>damps.</HI> And of this sort perhaps are the <HI>damps</HI> of the <HI>coalworks</HI> about <HI>Chedle;</HI> where above the <HI>Mines</HI> they have a rock of a greyish colour, call'd <HI>Pox-stone,</HI> so very hard, that where they doe not luckily meet with a cleft, they are forced to put fire to it, which in some time will make it flaw, or at least so soften it, that the pick-axes will enter it, which otherwise would not work away so much in a day, as will fill a hat. And yet these <HI>damps</HI> are neither visible nor noisome, nor will they take fire, but are so gross &amp; moist that they extinguish
<PB N="135" REF="92"/>it &amp; are suddenly mortal. Nor is the <HI>peas blossom damp</HI> (whereof we have an account from the learned <HI>Martin Lister</HI> Physitian at <HI>York</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph. Transact.</HI> Numb. 117.</NOTE>) either visible or noisom, it being so call'd, as they say, because it smells like the <HI>blossoms</HI> of <HI>peas,</HI> though they fancy it proceeds from the multitude of red <HI>trifoyle</HI> flowers, with which the Lime stone meddows of the <HI>Peak</HI> (where they have this sort of damp) doe much abound: and as it is not noisom, so neither was it ever heard that this was mortal to the <HI>Workmen,</HI> the scent perhaps freeing them from the danger of a surprize. Of this sort I enquired in the east part of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> where the <HI>Moore-lands</HI> bound upon the <HI>Peak-Country</HI> of <HI>Darbyshire,</HI> and found it not only there, but as far as I could learn, to be the most common damp in the Country, it making their candles first to diminish, to burn round, and at length to goe out, perfuming the <HI>Stauls</HI> at the same time with a faint sweet smell, as those in <HI>Darbyshire</HI> doe, only with this difference, that here they are said to be sometimes visible, shewing like a thin smoak, which may be seen not only in the <HI>grooves,</HI> but fuming out at the top of the pit. But here they are wiser (where they goe for their coal 40 or 50 yards deep, and have no such thing as <HI>trefoil;</HI> for many miles, and yet have this damp) than to think it proceeds either from <HI>peas</HI> or <HI>trefoil;</HI> it being rather apprehended to arise from the <HI>Workmens</HI> breath and sweat, mixt with the steams of the golden <HI>Marchasite</HI> or brass lumps, than any thing else.</P>

Not much unlike that (only in its fatality) we call the <HI>Globe∣damp,</HI> thought to be compounded of the Workmens breath &amp;c. and sweat of their bodies, together with the smoak of the candles they work by, which ascending to the uppermost parts of the <HI>grooves,</HI> there condense so much, that they become <HI>visible</HI> in the form and bigness of a <HI>foot ball,</HI> seeming to be cover'd with a skin, of of the thickness and colour of a <HI>Cobweb.</HI> These if by any casualty they come to be broken, they immediatly disperse themselves, and suffocat all the company, being altogether as mortal though not so violent; as the <HI>fulminating damps</HI> mention'd by the same worthy Gent. and the ingenious Mr. <HI>Jessop</HI> of <HI>Broomhall</HI> in <HI>Yorksh:</HI> to have happen'd not long since at <HI>Hasle-berg-hills,</HI> and at <HI>Wingersworth</HI> within two miles of <HI>Chesterfield</HI> An. 1675<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph.

<PB N="136" REF="93"/><HI>Windeless,</HI> and shakeing the very earth so much, that a <HI>Workman</HI> in another <HI>Bink</HI> hard by, fear'd the roof would have fallen in upon Him and buryed Him. The ingenious Mr <HI>Beaumont</HI> tells us they have this sort of <HI>Damp</HI> too, in some <HI>Coal-works</HI> bordering upon <HI>Mendip hills</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph. Collect.</HI> Numb. 1.</NOTE>, and that in the most Easterly ones of them, they are so very frequent, that scarce a pit fails of them, many Men of late years having been there kill'd, many others lam'd, and a multi∣tude burnt: many having been blown up at the <HI>works</HI> mouth, and the <HI>turn beam</HI> which hangs over the shaft, thrown off the frame by the force of it. It is also said to be in <HI>Scotland</HI> by Mr. <HI>Geo. Sinclar</HI> in a land call'd <HI>Werdy,</HI> West of <HI>Leith</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">G. Sinclar's Miscellan. Observ. <HI>p. 292. 293.</HI></NOTE>; which they there from its ef∣fects (that are very much like ours) are please'd to call <HI>Wild-fire,</HI> thinking it to proceed from a fat sort of coal, wherein there is a cer∣tain fire resembling an <HI>Ignis fatuus,</HI> which even in the day time is sometimes seen in the <HI>Coalworks</HI> in little holes shining like kindled <HI>sulphur,</HI> which uniting in the night when the <HI>workmen</HI> are gon home, if it meet with any fire at their return, it breaks out which such violence that it kills whomsoever it finds in its way.</P>
<P N="46">46. Yet neither of these were comparably strange to the <HI>fire-damp</HI> that happend at <HI>Mostyn</HI> in <HI>Flintshire</HI> in the <HI>Coalworks</HI> there, belongeing to the right Worshipfull Sr. <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI> Kt. <HI>Lord</HI> of that <HI>Manor</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph. Transact.</HI> Num. 136.</NOTE>, in the same year with that at <HI>Wingersworth;</HI> which upon making a <HI>Witchet,</HI> for drawing down the <HI>Spring</HI> that hinder'd their further wining of Coal, as soon as they were scanted of <HI>Air,</HI> the <HI>fire-damp</HI> appear'd in the crevisses or slits of the coal, (where water had been before) in a small blewish flame, which whil'st the <HI>Colli∣ers</HI> continued their work, was not so troublesom, as upon the in∣termission of 48 hours, within which time it got so much strength, that the <HI>Workmen</HI> looking into the Pit, could see it shooting from side to side like sword blades, cross one another, so that none durst venture to go downe into it. Upon this they took a pole and bound candles to it, which they no sooner put over the Eye of the pit, but the <HI>Damp</HI> would fly up at them with a long sharp flame, and put them out, leaving a foul ill scented smoak behind it. But finding this would not doe, they tyed many candles to the end of a hook fastend to a roap, and lowerd them down a little way into the pit, when up came the <HI>damp</HI> immediatly, and blew them all out, burnt their hair, beards, and clothes, struck down one of them, in the mean time making a noise like the roaring of a <HI>Bull,</HI> but loud∣er, leaving a stink behind it worse than the former; so heating the <HI>water</HI> that though drawn out of another distant pit, it was <HI>blood∣warm</HI> at least. After 3 days cessation more, the <HI>Steward</HI> going down
<PB N="137" REF="93"/>with some others to contrive conveyance of <HI>Air,</HI> one of them unad∣visedly puting his candle over the Eye of the pit, the <HI>damp</HI> im∣mediatly fired at it, burnt and tore their clothes from their backs, and flew to and fro all over the hollows with a great roaring; car∣rying most of the Men 15 or 16 yards from their first station, and one of them out of the pits Eye above 30 yards high, with a noise like a <HI>Cannon,</HI> only somewhat shriller, which was heard no less than 15 miles off: it also forcibly drove up the buckets and rope, with the Trunk or barrel that wound them up, of a 1000 weight, and tore it to pieces, though fasten'd to a strong frame with locks and bolts, and bound about with Iron.</P>
<P N="47">47. What should be the <HI>material causes</HI> of such prodigious effects as these, though it be hard to determin, yet I think I may be positive that the cause assigned by Mr. <HI>Geo Sinclar</HI> is insufficient<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">G. Sinclar's Mistellan. Observ. <HI>p. 293.</HI></NOTE>, though it may indeed be allowed to be a social cause: the oyliness and fat∣ness of the coal may be necessary indeed for its so quik takeing fire, but this will not account for its violence and noise: there must therefore certanly be somewhat of <HI>Niter,</HI> joyn'd with the <HI>bitumen</HI> and <HI>sulphur</HI> in the coal, to perform this feat. That <HI>bitumen</HI> must be a concurrent cause of such <HI>damps,</HI> I take to be evident indeed from hence, that in the relation at large of the <HI>fire damp</HI> above, it is said that it would play upon the surface of the water of a <HI>rainbow</HI> colour; and that <HI>Sulphur</HI> must also be an ingredient, I take to be as plain, for that in the same relation, it is expressly said, that in working the <HI>roach</HI> of coal 5 yards thick, when they came near the bottom, where the water was not mixt with <HI>sulphureous</HI> and <HI>brassy Metalls,</HI> the <HI>fire-damp</HI> was neither seen or heard of; and that <HI>Niter</HI> must also have a share in such dreadfull <HI>Scenes</HI> as these, I take to be as manifest as the facts themselves, since no such ex∣plosions can be made without it, and that the smoak that follows the fireing such <HI>damps,</HI> is on all hands confest to have the smell and colour of <HI>Gunpowder.</HI> But of this matter further, when I come to consider, how it comes to pass that so many of the <HI>coal-pits</HI> take fire of themselves.</P>
<P N="48">48. There is another sort of <HI>damp</HI> they call <HI>want</HI> of <HI>Air.</HI> i. e. want of Air sufficient for the breathing of <HI>Animals,</HI> and burning of <HI>Can∣dles.</HI> This sort of <HI>damp</HI> (improperly so call'd) is that they commonly meet with in long <HI>Soughs</HI> for conveyance of water from the coale; or when to avoid charge they run in their work as far underground as possible, for wining of coal, without leting down a new shaft. The cause of which sort of <HI>damp</HI> is cetainly nothing else, but the want of communication with the <HI>Air</HI> above ground, it being found by experience that the further a Man goes, into one of these <HI>coal-levels,</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="94"/>the flame of his candle will gradually grow less and less, till it goes quite out, and his difficulty of breathing greater and greater, till he cannot breathe at all, <HI>&amp; vice versa</HI> in his return. And so I found it in my entrance into the above mention'd <HI>Footerill</HI> at <HI>Apedale,</HI> where before we came 200 yards into it, 2 of the 3 candles I had in with me, went quite out, and the third was just expiring, in so much that I was forc't to make a retreat. This sort of <HI>damp</HI> is nothing so dangerous as some of the former, because not surprising, but comeing so gra∣dually, that a man may releive Himself at pleasure, though it be true enough too, that this will kill <HI>Animals,</HI> as well as extinguish <HI>coales</HI> or <HI>candles,</HI> if they be far enough removed from the <HI>Air</HI> above ground, and continue long enough there.</P>
<P N="49">49. And these seven (including one that's to follow) are all the <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>damps</HI> I have hitherto met with, which as so many <HI>diseases,</HI> have their respective <HI>cures,</HI> known by most <HI>Coalyers:</HI> a∣mongst which that of the first, or <HI>smothering damp,</HI> is the most difficult of any, it being sudden and surprising, comeing upon them unawares when they little think on't, and then too not always equally pernicious, the uncertainty whereof the most <HI>sagacious Workmen</HI> say depends upon the <HI>Wind;</HI> which if it sit toward the <HI>face</HI> of the <HI>work</HI> (as they call it) there is no danger, the <HI>subterraneal Air</HI> complying with that above, and by this means rather pressing the <HI>corrupted Air</HI> in the rifts and clefts, further into the <HI>coal-Wall,</HI> then bringing it forth: Whereas if it sit toward the <HI>old Wasts,</HI> the <HI>Air</HI> in the <HI>coal-rooms</HI> also presses that way, and as it were leads the <HI>corrupted Air</HI> forth, every thing naturally moving that way, where there is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east resi∣stance. And therefore the <HI>prudent Coalyer</HI> that knows his work lyable to these inconveniencies, always minds the <HI>Wind,</HI> which is the only way they have to avoid this sort of <HI>damp.</HI> The second sort of damp occasion'd by <HI>smoak,</HI> they dispel either by <HI>water,</HI> where they have no <HI>Air pits,</HI> and in winter time; but cheifly by <HI>fire,</HI> which they let down in an <HI>Iron cradle,</HI> they call their <HI>Lamp,</HI> into the shaft or <HI>by pit</HI> next to that they intend to work, which ma∣king a great draught of <HI>Air</HI> from the bottom of the works, the <HI>smoak-damp</HI> must necessarily come away, and <HI>fresh Air</HI> from a∣bove come down the other pit, where the <HI>Workmen</HI> went down, and the Coal is drawn forth. Which very way they use about <HI>Chedle,</HI> and 'tis a secure one too, but very chargeable; the charge of one of these shafts, by reason sometimes of the hardness of the rocks, vastness of the depth, drawing water &amp;c. often equalling, if not exceeding the ordinary charge of the whole <HI>Work:</HI> to
<PB N="139" REF="94"/>remedy which, I think the expedient divised and practised a∣bout <HI>Luyck</HI> or <HI>Leigh,</HI> communicated to the <HI>Royal Society</HI> by Sr <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> seems preferable to all others, for efficacy, ease, and cheapness<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph. Transact.</HI> Num. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="50">50. As for the <HI>peas blossom damp,</HI> the scent most times frees them from danger of a surprise, which 'tis likely indeed is the occasion (more than the innocency of the thing) we seldom hear that this is <HI>mortal:</HI> but if the Workmen at any time through too much rashness, do happen to be striken with it, they presently bring them up into the open Air, dig a hole in the ground, and lay them flat upon their belleys, with their faces in the hole, which (if not too far gone) infallibly recovers them. And for the <HI>pestilential damp</HI> that appears in the roofs of the <HI>coal-works</HI> in form of a <HI>foot ball,</HI> Mr <HI>Lister</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> Num. 117.</NOTE> tells us they have a way by the help of a stick and a long roap, of breaking it at a distance; which done, they pu∣rify the place well by fire, and then enter it again without much scruple. Much after the same manner as they also avoid the <HI>fire</HI> or <HI>fulminating damp,</HI> which says Mr <HI>Sinclar</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">G. Sinclar's Miscellan. Observ. <HI>p. 294.</HI></NOTE>, in <HI>Scotland</HI> is pre∣vented by a person that enters before the <HI>Workmen,</HI> who being cover'd with wet <HI>sackcloath,</HI> when He comes near the <HI>coal-wall</HI> where the fire is feared, He creepeth on his belly with a long pole before him, having a lighted candle on the top on't, with whose flame the <HI>wild-fire</HI> meeting, it breaketh with violence, and runing along the roof, goeth out with a noise at the mouth of the <HI>sink;</HI> the person that gave fire escaping by creeping on the ground, and keeping his face close to it, till it be over past. Iust as they did at first with the <HI>fire damp</HI> at <HI>Mostyn</HI> v, where the workmen every morning before they went down into the pit, used to send a <HI>resolute Coalyer</HI> before, whose manner was to put on the <HI>worst raggs</HI> He had and wet them in water, and as soon as He came within danger of it, He fell groveling down upon his belly, and went in that manner forward, holding in one hand a long rod or pole to which he tyed candles burning, &amp; reached them by degrees towards it, then the <HI>damp</HI> would fly at them, and if it mist of puting them out, it would quench it self with a blast, lea∣ving a noisom ill scented smoak behind it.</P>
<P N="51">51. The <HI>privative damp</HI> or <HI>want</HI> of <HI>Air,</HI> is best cured the same way the <HI>smoaky damp</HI> is, by setting down a shaft to the <HI>adit,</HI> as soon as the candles begin to burn orbicular and to lessen, and the <HI>VVork∣man</HI> is any thing sensible of a difficulty of breathing; which infal∣libly cures it. And these are the peculiar <HI>remedies</HI> for each res∣pective <HI>damp,</HI> most whereof may plainly be reduced to <HI>motion,</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph. Transact.</HI> Num. 136.</NOTE>
<PB N="140" REF="95"/>which I take to be the <HI>catholic remedy</HI> of all <HI>damps,</HI> which confirms me in my first opinion that the <HI>causa sine qua non</HI> of all <HI>damps,</HI> is want of motion: for come they either from <HI>corruption</HI> of <HI>Air</HI> alone; from <HI>smoak;</HI> from the <HI>scent</HI> of <HI>vegetables;</HI> from the <HI>sweat</HI> or <HI>breath</HI> of <HI>Mens</HI> bodies; from the steams of noxious <HI>minerals</HI> &amp;c. though never so mortal; or from <HI>want</HI> of <HI>Air;</HI> yet grant but a <HI>circulation</HI> of <HI>Air</HI> in the <HI>coal-chamber,</HI> or let the <HI>waters</HI> that commonly annoy such <HI>Mines,</HI> be drawn thence, not by a <HI>Sough,</HI> or <HI>free natural course,</HI> but by <HI>force,</HI> as by laving, buckets, pumps &amp;c. either of them shall be so broken, disperst, and at length gradually brought (with the motion of all other things that way) through the <HI>Eye</HI> of the Pit into the open <HI>Air,</HI> that they shall have little or no∣thing of the effect, which if sufferd to unite (through cessation of labour or otherwise) they would certainly have. Whence it is that <HI>Coal-works</HI> that are wet, and always require a forcible drain; are much more wholsom, than those made dry, by a free course of water, as by a <HI>Sough,</HI> which by a constant unforc't descent, quickly exhausts the rifts of a <HI>coal-work,</HI> and fits them for the rece∣ption of <HI>corruptible Air.</HI> Whence 'tis also that in <HI>Mines</HI> not draind by a <HI>Sough,</HI> when the <HI>Springs</HI> are <HI>low,</HI> and fill not up the passages in the coal, nor require so prepetual and forcible a <HI>drain</HI> as they use to doe; that then, at that time of the year, at the latter end of <HI>Summer,</HI> the <HI>coal-works</HI> are most lyable to poysonous <HI>damps,</HI> that the <HI>Air</HI> stagnates in the void spaces and corrupts, and is quietly impregnated with noxious <HI>mineral</HI> steams.</P>
<P N="52">52. Which are sometimes so very strong, that they force their way through the <HI>pores</HI> of the <HI>earth,</HI> where there hath never been any <HI>Sough</HI> or <HI>shaft</HI> set down to give them vent, and are very noi∣som though in the open <HI>Air</HI> above ground, which may pass I think for a seventh sort of <HI>damp,</HI> though the same materially with some of the former: whereof there are two manifest <HI>instan∣ces</HI> in this <HI>Connty,</HI> near the same place; one, under the bank of the South side of <HI>Tettenhall</HI> wood, where passengers sometimes in mornings and evenings, meet with a very offensive troublesom <HI>damp,</HI> of which they can give no account, which yet no question must come from some such <HI>principles</HI> as were the causes of the fore∣mention'd <HI>subterraneal damps,</HI> though I have not heard that any met with here, have proved mortal, as another of this kind (for I cannot imagin it any think else) which in the year 1671 in a house in <HI>Tettenhall,</HI> struck 5 men and no more, of 200 that were then present at the <HI>monthly meeting</HI> of <HI>Iustices,</HI> whereof 3 dyed quickly after, the other two recoverd in some measure, but are still troubled with <HI>vertigo's</HI> or disyness in the head, which I take to be some remains of the first <HI>poison.</HI> But how it should affect

<PB N="142" REF="96"/>burning till it's all spent, and then goes out of it self as soon as it comes to the rock of coal, which if it have no rifts or clefts in it, ad∣mits it not: insomuch that the <HI>inhabitants</HI> of these places are not concern'd at it, nor have half the dread upon them for it, that those have that live remote, far enough out of its reach.

That which was felt at <HI>Oxon:</HI> about 7 in the morning <HI>Sept:</HI> 17. 1683, was also accompanied with a noise like distant <HI>Thunder,</HI> the murmuring sound (as it appeard to me) preceding the shock about two <HI>Seconds</HI> of time. <HI>Octob:</HI> 9th in the same year, about eleven at night there happen'd a∣nother in <HI>Stafford-shire</HI> and all the adjoyning <HI>Counties,</HI> which as I have it from good hands, was not without a <HI>noise</HI> neither; whence I conclude that few or none happen without, and that all of them have their <HI>origin</HI> from the kindling and explosion of <HI>fire-damps;</HI> though I doe not remember I must confess that the <HI>earthquake</HI> at <HI>Bushbury,</HI> that fell out there (they will tell you upon opening the <HI>Friars</HI> Tomb) within the memory of man (for I spake with one that remember'd it well) had any that attended it, though it was so considerable as 'to make the pewter clatter in their houses, and the great pot they boyled their meat in, at <HI>Bushbury</HI> hall, to leap up from the ground: but this indeed needed not any great <HI>explosion,</HI> for it was so very peculiar, that it did not extend beyond the bounds of the parish; nor was it valuable any where, but about the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P N="57"><PB N="144" REF="97"/>57. If it be objected that <HI>Air</HI> is so necessary to the being and duration of <HI>fire,</HI> that a subterraneal one, though actually kindled, could hardly continue long without extinction, and surely much less be kindled there. And secondly that if these <HI>noises</HI> which attend <HI>earthquakes,</HI> proceed from the kindling and explosion of <HI>natural Gunpowder</HI> made up of <HI>coal, Sulphur,</HI> and <HI>niter,</HI> as the <HI>artificial</HI> is; we should find it some where, or some time or other, break forth of the earth and shew it self, which yet we hear little or nothing of. And thirdly that <HI>earthquakes</HI> many times happen, where one at least, if not more of these materials, were never known to be; as at <HI>Oxford</HI> above mentiond; and that therefore in such places however, it is by no means likely, that <HI>earthquakes</HI> should proceed from the assigned causes. To the first I answer, that <HI>Air</HI> is so unnecessary to that sort of fire kindled from the principles, and in the circumstances abovemention'd, that we find it in the relation of the <HI>fire damps</HI> at <HI>Mostyn,</HI> they never began to appear till the <HI>Workmen</HI> perceiv'd a <HI>want</HI> of <HI>Air,</HI> that being esteemed a great nourisher, as the <HI>immission</HI> of <HI>Air,</HI> from above, a destroyer of them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph. Transact.</HI> Numb. 136. p. 897. and 898.</NOTE>. Which may give an account in some measure for the <HI>perpetual Lamps</HI> of the <HI>ancients</HI> shut close up in <HI>Tombs</HI> or other <HI>subterraneal Cells,</HI> which could have no communication with <HI>external Air,</HI> and were preserved by it, the <HI>oile</HI> perhaps being somewhat of this kind, all <HI>Histories</HI> agreeing that they were all extinguish't presently upon the least <HI>immission</HI> of <HI>external Air.</HI> Not to mention that our <HI>hot Bathes</HI> may be also accounted for, this way, this sort of fire heating water as well as any other, as was plain at <HI>Mostyn,</HI> and as it is at <HI>Mount Hecla</HI> or <HI>Hecklefield</HI> in the cold <HI>Country</HI> of <HI>Ice-land,</HI> which sometimes throws forth scolding hot water, and from whence 'tis they have springs so <HI>hot</HI> in that <HI>Country,</HI> that in a quarter of an hour they will suffici∣ently boyle great pieces of beef<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mr Collins's account of Ice∣land. <HI>p. 78.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="58">58. And to the second it may be replyed, that though in most <HI>cold regions,</HI> where the Earth is not so plentifully stored with <HI>Minerals</HI> as 'tis in the <HI>hot;</HI> and where the pores of it are shut in the time of earthquakes, which commonly happen here toward winter, and most commonly upon frosts, these fires seldom or never break out, but in all probability are extinguish't after some time with their owne filthy smoak: yet that in <HI>forraigne Countreys</HI> of a warmer <HI>Climat,</HI> where the earth is commonly replenish't with <HI>Minerals,</HI> and the pores of it always open with <HI>heat;</HI> there is no∣thing a more certain attendant of an <HI>earthquake,</HI> than an eruption of fire somewhere within its verge. The <HI>earthquakes</HI> that so fre∣quently
<PB N="145" REF="97"/>(that I say not always) precede the <HI>eruptions</HI> of <HI>flaming Moun∣tains,</HI> make good this; whereof <HI>Pliny</HI> who was of this opinion, and compares <HI>Earthquakes</HI> to <HI>thunder</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">C. Plinii <HI>2</HI>di. Hist. Nat. <HI>Lib. 2. cap. 79.</HI></NOTE>, gives us an extraordinary instance which fell out near <HI>Rome, Lucius Martius</HI> and <HI>Sex. Julius</HI> being <HI>Consuls;</HI> when two <HI>Mountains</HI> were seen to assault one another with a very great <HI>noise,</HI> smoak and fire issuing from between them at their congress and regress, a multitude of <HI>Roman Knights,</HI> their <HI>servants,</HI> and <HI>Travellers,</HI> looking on the while from the <HI>Ae∣mylian</HI> way<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> Lib. 2. cap 83.</NOTE>.

The like happen'd not long after in the <HI>Isle de la Palma,</HI> one of the <HI>Canary's Nov.</HI> 13. 1677. where about a ¼ of an hour before Sun set, an <HI>earthquake</HI> began which continued to the 17<SUP>th</SUP> with a thundering noise in the bowels of the earth, more especially in the plain call'd the <HI>Canios;</HI> where, and in divers other places, the earth open'd several <HI>mouthes,</HI> to the number of 18. whence with the same thundering noise, issued <HI>fire</HI> and <HI>smoak, melted rocks,</HI> and <HI>fiery stones,</HI> which it threw so high into the <HI>Air,</HI> that the people lost sight of them<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Lectio Cutler. de potent. restit. <HI>p. 52.53.</HI></NOTE>. Mount <HI>Hecla</HI> too, which is always burning more or less, has also in proportion as constant an <HI>earthquake</HI> attends it, as <HI>Martineir</HI> informs us, who with his <HI>companion</HI> and two <HI>guides</HI> traveld up it about half a league, when it was reckon'd prety quiet, yet found it then to <HI>tremble</HI> so un∣der their feet, and heard such a strange crashing and <HI>rumbleing</HI> within, that they were glad to get back again as fast as they could, for fear of being swallowed<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Marti∣neir's Northern voyage <HI>p. 134.</HI></NOTE>; and if it trembled in this manner in its quietest condition, what must it doe when it burns with its greatest vehemence? when, as we find it in the <HI>Geologia Norwegica,</HI> it makes a terrible rumbleing like loud thunder, where∣as in other <HI>Counties</HI> where there is less exuberance of matter, these explosions (which are ratably weaker) must be stricktly pent up to make an <HI>earthquake,</HI> which let loose through any <HI>ductus</HI> into the open <HI>Air,</HI> would cause no such matter, and this I take to be the reason why we have no such <HI>fiery eruptions</HI> upon <HI>earthquakes</HI> here, as they have abroad.</P>
<P N="59">59. Tis true indeed that about <HI>Oxford</HI> we have no such matter as <HI>coal</HI> that yet we know of, and yet have <HI>earthquakes</HI> now and then
<PB N="146" REF="98"/>which was the third objection; and is answer'd already by Dr. <HI>Power</HI> § 54, where He says that the <HI>golden Marchasit</HI> or <HI>brass lumps</HI> moistned with water, are sufficient to produce heats and actual fire without <HI>coal;</HI> to which add <HI>niter,</HI> of both which there is plenty about <HI>Oxford,</HI> and we have sufficient materials to supply for an <HI>earthquake,</HI> and the <HI>noise</HI> too, that commonly attends them. Beside the <HI>pyrites</HI> or <HI>Marchasits</HI> about <HI>Oxford</HI> lye generally, if not always, in a dark blew clay, which after further concoction of many <HI>Ages</HI> perhaps many come to be <HI>coal:</HI> however as it is, it seems to be somewhat like the <HI>laming</HI> that lyes between the <HI>measures</HI> of <HI>coal,</HI> which according to one opinion § 54 was look't upon as one of the <HI>materials</HI> as productive of <HI>heat</HI> and <HI>fire,</HI> as any of the rest: which if so, this <HI>blew clay</HI> perhaps may supply the place of <HI>coal</HI> in the process of <HI>nature</HI> for begetting an <HI>earthquake,</HI> as per∣fectly and well, as if <HI>coal</HI> were at hand, though I must confess were there any other circumstances favorable, this would induce one to think <HI>coal</HI> could not be far off. Which brings me</P>
<P N="60">60. Lastly, to the <HI>signes</HI> whereby they find <HI>coal,</HI> and the methods they use in finding and diging them; which though they properly indeed belong to the <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Arts,</HI> yet for the reasons above mention'd, I shall treat of them here. For finding of <HI>coal,</HI> if in a place where never any have bin discover'd, they first consult the <HI>springs</HI> if any near, to see whether they can find any <HI>coal water</HI> i. e. an acid water having a <HI>Car,</HI> or yellow sediment: above ground they look for a <HI>smut</HI> as they call it, i. e. a <HI>friable black earth:</HI> when they meet with either of these, they reckon themselves under circumstances tolerably good for the finding of <HI>coal,</HI> which prompt them next ei∣ther to <HI>boar</HI> or <HI>sink</HI> a <HI>pit;</HI> the former whereof if they think the <HI>coal</HI> lyes shallow, is the better of the two; but if it lye deep, it be∣comes almost as expensive as <HI>sinking</HI> a <HI>pit,</HI> the drawing the rods of the <HI>Augre</HI> expending very much time, in reguard they are many, and that it must be done frequently; besides its leaving the <HI>Search∣er</HI> under great uncertainties, in respect of the course of the <HI>coal,</HI> the <HI>draining</HI> it, its <HI>goodness</HI> and <HI>thickness;</HI> all which are very con∣siderable in the <HI>search</HI> of <HI>coal.</HI> Whereas by sinking, all these un∣certainties are removed, only the <HI>charge</HI> is certain, for that in all <HI>virgin grounds</HI> where the <HI>coal</HI> lyes intire and untouch't, there is always a great <HI>affluence</HI> of <HI>water,</HI> which many times brings the <HI>un∣fortunat inquisitor,</HI> not only under a necessity of a great expence for <HI>drawing</HI> of <HI>water,</HI> but sometimes too, to let Himself know that the work can never turn to account: However of the two, this is reekon'd the better, for the reasons above mentiond.</P>
<P N="61">61. As it is also where search is made, where <HI>coal</HI> is al∣ready known to be, either by their appearing to the day any
<PB N="147" REF="98"/>where, as by <HI>Rivers</HI> fides, or having been dug not far of: the <HI>ran∣ges</HI> of the <HI>Metalls</HI> already known, and their <HI>distances,</HI> with their <HI>diping,</HI> and the <HI>rise</HI> of <HI>ground</HI> above them, giving directions al∣most infallibly where they shalt set down their <HI>pit.</HI> For these being known, 'tis no great difficulty to judg whereabout they'l <HI>crop</HI> out; that which lyes lowest, comeing forth furthest; and that which uppermost, nighest to the place foreknown: So that supposeing the worst that can befal the <HI>Searcher</HI> in the use of this <HI>Method,</HI> that He should find Himself mistaken in seting down his Pit, and meet either with a <HI>Metall</HI> that lyes above, or under the <HI>coal;</HI> in the first case all He has to doe, is to move in proportion so much backward, and in the latter so much forward, and He sinks his pit just upon it. In finding of <HI>coal</HI> the most skillfull <HI>Work∣men</HI> give much heed to the <HI>roof,</HI> whereby they will not only tell what <HI>mine</HI> they are over, but the quality of the <HI>coal</HI> too, as to its goodness or badness; a <HI>roof</HI> of loose <HI>rotten stone</HI> without any certain <HI>beding</HI> or <HI>diping,</HI> being a certain <HI>Index</HI> of ill <HI>rotten coal;</HI> as a <HI>firme roof, vice versa,</HI> is of a <HI>good one.</HI></P>
<P N="62">62. When the <HI>coal</HI> is found, they work it according to the greater or lesser <HI>diping:</HI> if it be a <HI>rearing mine</HI> or <HI>edg-coal</HI> as some call it, cuting the <HI>superficies</HI> of the earth at <HI>right angles,</HI> if yet of a sufficient thickness to be thought worth working at all, they sink a pit as deep as the water will give leave, and work along the <HI>row</HI> or <HI>streek</HI> as far as they think convenient: if it <HI>rise</HI> or <HI>crop</HI> with the ascent of a hill, and is fit for a <HI>footrill,</HI> as at <HI>Apedale,</HI> they follow the <HI>row</HI> or <HI>side basset</HI> of the <HI>coal,</HI> as far as the <HI>want</HI> of <HI>Air</HI> will permit them, and at due distances make <HI>setings up</HI> acoording to the <HI>cro∣ping</HI> of the <HI>coal,</HI> i. e. as other Coal works are dug with a <HI>side dip,</HI> so these in an <HI>up dip.</HI> The <HI>footrill</HI> at <HI>Apedale</HI> is driven in thus upon a <HI>level</HI> about 200 yards, in which space there are 12 <HI>setings</HI> up, haveing <HI>pillars</HI> at each side which they call <HI>ribs,</HI> between which they must carry up their work, though the <HI>coal</HI> hath <HI>leiths</HI> or <HI>joynts</HI> in it that run otherways, according to which yet they cannot work it as they doe in the <HI>Flat</HI> and <HI>hanging mines;</HI> which they divide into partitions or <HI>wallings</HI> as they call them, more or less in number according as the mine <HI>dips:</HI> if but little, which they call a <HI>flat mine,</HI> the <HI>wallings</HI> are so many the more, in regard it is workable a great way, before either the <HI>Mine</HI> will <HI>dip</HI> to the <HI>water,</HI> or <HI>crop</HI> to the <HI>grass:</HI> if a <HI>hanging mine,</HI> so many the less, in proportion likewise to the diping.</P>
<P N="63">63. I went down into one of these <HI>hanging mines</HI> at <HI>Harding∣swood</HI> belonging to the aforemention'd Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> of this <HI>County,</HI> where He shewed me a <HI>level</HI> of 35 yards of <HI>roach</HI> as it lay in an ob∣lique <HI>diping</HI> line above the water, which came to 35 foot <HI>perpen∣dicular,</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="99"/>diping one foot to every yard: in this <HI>Level</HI> He had five <HI>wallings</HI> or <HI>Stauls,</HI> out of which they dug the <HI>coal</HI> in great blocks; between the <HI>wallings</HI> there were <HI>ribbs</HI> left, and passages through them called <HI>thurlings,</HI> which give convenience of <HI>Air,</HI> and passage for the <HI>coal</HI> out of one <HI>walling</HI> into another, which in all <HI>coal mines</HI> stand thick or thin, partly according to the substance of the <HI>coal;</HI> most commonly thiner in the lower <HI>wallings,</HI> which are therefore consequently wider; and thicker in the upper <HI>wallings,</HI> which must be therefore narrower, the <HI>coal</HI> of the upper <HI>wallings</HI> being generally nasher; <HI>i. e.</HI> softer and more friable then that of the lower <HI>wallings,</HI> which are more firme and solid: whence they compare the <HI>coal</HI> of the upper <HI>wallings</HI> to brush wood, as burn∣ing swifter, sweeter, and clear from soot; and that of the lower <HI>wallings</HI> to hard wood, as being more solid and lasting, though making more soot. But in this point they mind not so much the <HI>coal</HI> as the <HI>roof,</HI> the <HI>wallings</HI> or <HI>staules</HI> being made narrower or wider, according as that is found better or worse, which some∣times being nothing but a <HI>bass,</HI> full of <HI>joynts;</HI> and perhaps soluble in the Air, they are forced then to leave a yard of <HI>coal</HI> that lyes next under it for a <HI>roof,</HI> and make their <HI>wallings</HI> narrow: whereas on the contrary where there is a <HI>strong rock</HI> next the <HI>coal,</HI> and no <HI>bass,</HI> they will then venture their <HI>roof</HI> so far sometimes as to make their <HI>wallings</HI> 8 or 9 yards wide, which <HI>roof</HI> of <HI>rock</HI> puts me in mind that tis time to shut up this tedious discourse of <HI>coal,</HI> and pro∣ceed to the succeding <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P N="64">64. But before I enter on it, perhaps it may not be amiss to add a word or two concerning the Methods they use in laying their coales <HI>dry,</HI> when any thing troubled with <HI>water,</HI> which because they are not so frequently, or so much, as in some other <HI>Countrys,</HI> they are not forced upon such variety of expensive <HI>Engines.</HI> The ordinary ways they use are by <HI>Sough</HI> or by <HI>Gin.</HI> The former when they have the advantage of fall of ground enough, which they try by the <HI>Level,</HI> and then either dig a trench open to the surface, like a great ditch as deep as the <HI>coale,</HI> or drive in a <HI>cuniculus</HI> about a yard <HI>diameter</HI> to the pavement (if they can) of the lowest dip, of the lowest <HI>measure</HI> of <HI>coale,</HI> which without more adoe will lay all the <HI>coal</HI> so dry, toward the <HI>Crop,</HI> that it may be workt without diffi∣culty. But when they have no fall, they draw it up by <HI>Gin,</HI> which is made either bigger, or less, according to the exi∣gence of the work; the less they call a <HI>Iack,</HI> which is either turned by <HI>Men,</HI> as requiring less strength; or by <HI>Horses,</HI> ac∣cording as the <HI>Owner</HI> thinks most fit. But the <HI>Gin</HI> is always work't by <HI>Horses,</HI> which likewise is two-fold, either by <HI>chain,</HI> or by <HI>barrells:</HI> the chain is made with leather <HI>suckers</HI> upon
<PB N="149" REF="99"/>it at lit le distances, which bring up water, and discharge themselves into a <HI>trough</HI> set near the Eye of the pit, whence tis carryed off by a small trench. The <HI>Gin</HI> by <HI>Barrells,</HI> whereof always one goes up as the other goes downe, will also void great quantities of water, provided they be constantly fol∣lowed day and night, else upon the least neglect, the water will get such head, that much time will be spent before it can be master'd again, which <HI>Engines</HI> being so common, and so easy of apprehension, as not to deserve a <HI>Cut,</HI> or the <HI>Readers</HI> view; I have saved my self the expence, and Him the trouble, both of the one and th' other.</P>

IN the two preceding <HI>Chapters,</HI> having run through the <HI>Mineralia media;</HI> the <HI>Earths, Salts, Sulphurs,</HI> and <HI>Bitu∣mens;</HI> the order of <HI>Nature</HI> next requires me to descend to the <HI>Stones</HI> and <HI>Metalls,</HI> the two remaining <HI>species</HI> of the <HI>Mine∣ral Kingdom,</HI> which will be both absolv'd in this, and the following <HI>Chapter.</HI> How all <HI>stones</HI> were chiefly made out of <HI>Salts</HI> with a mixture of <HI>earths</HI> and <HI>sulphurs,</HI> was shewn in generall, in the <HI>Hi∣story</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nat.

<P N="2">2. And this I take to be very probable, because we know of no <HI>things</HI> in nature that unite so strictly as these <HI>two</HI> doe, makeing a <HI>coagulum</HI> in bodies that at first sight seem very unlikly to performe any such matter; witness the <HI>offa alba</HI> of <HI>Helmont,</HI> a thick gross substance, far from the nature of a <HI>liquid,</HI> made out of the spirits of <HI>wine</HI> and <HI>urin</HI> highly <HI>rectify'd;</HI> and another such like <HI>Offa</HI> made of the spirits of <HI>Ʋitriol</HI> and <HI>Salt,</HI> by a solution of <HI>Saturne</HI> made with distill'd Vinegar<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph.

Thus <HI>transparent stones</HI> having little or nothing of those terrestrieties the <HI>opake</HI> ones have; seem to be made of pure solutions of such like <HI>salts,</HI> and transparent <HI>Sulphurs,</HI> or <HI>Ambers,</HI>

<P N="4">4. For there is nothing in nature, except <HI>Talc</HI> and <HI>Amiantus,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="103"/>that supports the force of fire equally to <HI>Salts,</HI> whence 'tis that some sorts of stones endure fire much better than others, when they are well sated with <HI>Salts,</HI> and have but little <HI>sulphur,</HI> and the parts of those <HI>salts</HI> well adapted to one another without <HI>cavities;</HI> for wherever there are iuterstices betwixt the parts, there must be <HI>rarefactions</HI> upon the advent of <HI>fire,</HI> whence follows flawing at least, if not flying of the stone; neither of which can be endured in a <HI>furnace.</HI> The stone most prized for this purpose, of any I could hear of all over the <HI>County,</HI> is a sort they dig on <HI>Whiston moor,</HI> not far from <HI>Chedle,</HI> in the <HI>Moorlands;</HI> and at <HI>Huntington</HI> upon the edg of <HI>Cank-wood;</HI> these they trye first in their <HI>Forge</HI> fires, to see whe∣ther they will flaw or fly or no, and if the stone of any quarry pass two or three tryals, they then conclude upon the whole, and take it thencforward for good, without further tryal: which is all con∣cerning it: but that the best stone for this purpose, is generally ob∣served to lye in <HI>Clay;</HI> and that if the texture of it happen not to be close and firme, it is apt to run upon <HI>frosts</HI> and <HI>moist</HI> weather; of which sort I take the stone to be, call'd <HI>Glum-metall,</HI> about <HI>Brad∣wall</HI> in the <HI>Moorelands,</HI> which as I was told by the ingenious <HI>Ralph Sneyd</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> though as hard to digg as any rock; yet the Air, rains, and frosts, will mollify it so; that it will run as if it were a <HI>natural Lime,</HI> and no question would they use it, must be good for land. And this brings me next to consider.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Limestone rocks,</HI> whereof to their great benefit they have plenty enough almost in all parts of the <HI>Country,</HI> it being a sort of stone not so much usefull here for their <HI>buildings,</HI> as for <HI>fer∣tilizing</HI> their heathy, gorsy, and broomy lands; for though when burnt, it part with most of its <HI>sulphur,</HI> yet at the same time it ad∣mits fiery particles, which upon <HI>moisture,</HI> together with its <HI>salt</HI> now clear'd from the bonds of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> it freely dispenses to the cold poor ground, giving it at the same time <HI>warmth,</HI> and <HI>saltness,</HI> the cheif principles of vegetation; forceing the ground to exert it self to so prodigious a rate (which is its only fault) that it sometimes beggers it for ever after: wherein they say <HI>marling</HI> is to be preferr'd before it, that cherishing and improveing the innate strength of the Land, and continuing so to doe for a long time; this only highten∣ing the present vigour, but preying upon it (like <HI>brandy</HI> upon the <HI>Spirits</HI> of an <HI>Animal</HI>) and quite extinguishing it in a little time. However it must needs be good for their cold, moist, black, bitu∣minous earths; whereof there is great quantities in the <HI>Moors</HI> of this <HI>Country,</HI> which without it would scarce produce any thing at all.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is dug in great plenty upon the banks of <HI>Dove,</HI> from <HI>Beresford</HI> downward, and ha's been reputed to give the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ddows on that river their great fertility, but I think it can doe but little before 'tis
<PB N="153" REF="103"/>burnt, its salts being then clog'd and fetter'd with Sulphur, a bet∣ter and truer cause of that fertility having been assigned before, Chap. 2. § 2. of this book.</P>
<P N="6">6. At <HI>Waterfall</HI> also on this side the <HI>Country,</HI> it rises in <HI>tables</HI> or <HI>slats</HI> about two inches thick, of so very fine a grain and close texture that it polishes like <HI>Marble,</HI> whereof in the <HI>arbours</HI> up and down the <HI>Country</HI> I found tables made of it: but it is so far from a wonder that <HI>Lime-stone</HI> should be <HI>marble;</HI> that most <HI>marble</HI> (that I say not all) will burne to <HI>Lime,</HI> and is consequently a <HI>Limestone,</HI> though all <HI>Limestone</HI> be not <HI>marble.</HI> They dig <HI>Limestone</HI> also at <HI>Madeley</HI> on the other side the <HI>Moorelands</HI> in the Lordship of the Worshipfull <HI>Iohn Offley</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> beside good <HI>coal,</HI> and <HI>Marle,</HI> which should have been mention'd before: but the best of all is said to be in the Southern parts of the <HI>County,</HI> in <HI>Hurstfield</HI> within the <HI>Manor</HI> of <HI>Sedgley</HI> belonging to the Honorable <HI>William Ward</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and in the old <HI>Park</HI> near <HI>Dudley Castle</HI> belonging to the right Honorable <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Ward;</HI> and all about <HI>Walsall,</HI> particularly at <HI>Rushall,</HI> in the lands of the learned <HI>Henry Legh</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P>
<P N="7">7. Where it lyes in beds for the most part <HI>Horizontally,</HI> and is broken up with Iron wedges knockt in at the partitions with great sledges, and prized up with great <HI>leavers</HI> with rings round them, to stay the feet of the <HI>Workmen</HI> who get upon them, whereof some weigh at least 150 pounds: Notwithstanding which vast force the <HI>stones</HI> will not rise, unless softened by fire, which upon that ac∣count they are constrain'd to make on it. When they have got∣ten the <HI>stone,</HI> they burn it in oblong pits, made in the ground, about seven yards long, 3 wide, and but 6 or 7 foot deep at the <HI>but</HI> of the pit: wherein first they lay a little wood or gorse to keep the <HI>coal</HI> from the ground, which is laid under the <HI>stone,</HI> the first <HI>stratum</HI> but thin, not above 3 inches thick; then a <HI>stratum</HI> of <HI>stone</HI> about 6 inches deep; the next floor of <HI>coal</HI> they make 10 inches thick, and the layer of <HI>stone</HI> above that, 18 inches: the next of <HI>coal</HI> above that, is usually about a foot thick, and the floor of <HI>stone</HI> over it double the thickness; then the 4 layer of <HI>coal</HI> is but 10 inches, and the 4 of stone but 18; then above all another <HI>stratum</HI> of <HI>coal</HI> about 2 or 3 inches, which they cover with <HI>parget</HI> or <HI>mortar,</HI> made with slak't lime and water to keep in the heat: the <HI>coal</HI> laid in this manner with the <HI>stone</HI> S. S. S. burning it gradually into <HI>Lime</HI> in about a weeks time. Which sort of <HI>Lime pit</HI> ha's this peculiar convenience above all others I ever yet saw, that they can take away the <HI>Lime</HI> that is first burnt while the rest is on fire, and can make up the <HI>but</HI> of the <HI>pit,</HI> whilst tis yet burning at the <HI>mouth.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Beside, in this Method and manner of burning of <HI>Limestone,</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="104"/>the <HI>Workmen</HI> seem not to run the hazard other <HI>Lime-burners</HI> doe, who burn it with wood after the common practise of other <HI>Coun∣tries;</HI> who if they keep not their fire still forward as they call it, but suffer it to slacken never so little before the <HI>stone</HI> is quite cal∣cined, shall never after be able to make <HI>Lime</HI> of them at all: for if the <HI>flame</HI> which has once open'd the pores of the <HI>stone</HI> be but checkt a little before the work is finisht, the pores will some way or other so close themselves up, and the whole matter so sink into a lump, that twenty times the fewel that would have kept them open, and the mass of stone asunder, will never recover them so as admit the <HI>flame</HI> again, which cannot now rise amongst the <HI>stones,</HI> there being none of those <HI>interstices</HI> now left either in the body of the <HI>stone</HI> it self, or between them, for it to pass through as before. Whereas in this way of <HI>Lime burning,</HI> by <HI>stratification,</HI> as it seems morally impossible for the <HI>Workman</HI> to be so negligent as to slacken a fire which still burns on of it self; so it seems naturally so, that a mass of <HI>stone</HI> should ever so fall down into a lump, being thus divided by <HI>coal,</HI> as either way to be render'd uncapable of being made into <HI>Lime.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Next the stones holding a signal quantity of <HI>Salt,</HI> I proceed to such as have a mixture of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and such are all that with a steel, or by a quick attrition with any other fit body, will strike <HI>fire,</HI> or kindle its parts into <HI>sparks,</HI> all which by the <HI>Naturalists</HI> are aptly enough stiled <HI>pyrites;</HI> under which <HI>genus</HI> we may reckon <HI>Sands, pebbles,</HI> and <HI>Marchasits,</HI> of each of which, as many as I find any way remarkable, as breifly as may be. And first of <HI>sands,</HI> which says <HI>Ferrante Imperato</HI> are the least form of a stone<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dell' Hist. naturale <HI>Lib. 1. cap. 21.</HI> sub finem.</NOTE>; where∣of I met with a sort at <HI>Bilston</HI> or <HI>Bilson</HI> that I think is so indeed, so very fine that it is hardly palpable, it is of a deep orange colour, and is sent for by <HI>Artists</HI> living at a great distance, and used by them as a <HI>spaud</HI> to cast <HI>Metalls</HI> with. Other <HI>sands</HI> of use I met with none, but <HI>sands</HI> for the <HI>glass-houses,</HI> whereof I was told of one that excell'd the rest, dug somewhere near <HI>West Bromwich;</HI> and a sort of <HI>sand</HI> they have at <HI>Gaston</HI> in the parish of <HI>Ipston,</HI> which being first wash't from the dirt, then dryed and sifted from the smaller sand, and in another sieve from the pebbles it has amongst it, they then use it, being strewed upon a greasy boar'd, as an excellent <HI>sand</HI> to whet their <HI>Sithes,</HI> whence it has the denomination of <HI>Sithe-Sand.</HI> Unless we may reckon a sort of friable stone of a deep yellow colour found <HI>sparsim</HI> in lumps amongst the stiffest and fattest <HI>Marles</HI> at <HI>Eardley</HI> in the parish of <HI>Audley,</HI> amongst the <HI>sands:</HI> which I think I need not scruple much to doe, since I find them to crumble be∣tween the fingers, yet so very fine are its parts that at the same
<PB N="155" REF="104"/>time they give a <HI>colour,</HI> and as the ingenious <HI>Robert Wilmot</HI> of <HI>Eardley</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in whose grounds they are found, sent we word, are some sorts of them used by the <HI>painters,</HI> and by the <HI>work∣men</HI> all call'd by the general name of <HI>Rosemary-stones.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. What these should be, and how come to be produced in a substance of so quite a different nature from them, as a stiff sat Marle; was a <HI>problem</HI> that at first sight gave me some trouble: till remembring that in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> I met with much such <HI>yellow lumps</HI> growing <HI>sparsim</HI> here and there amongst the <HI>Chalk</HI> in most of the pits of the <HI>Chiltern Country,</HI> there call'd <HI>Iron moulds</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nat. Hist. of Oxfordsh.</HI> chap. 3. § 51.</NOTE>; and that the learned <HI>Martin Lister</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> mentions the same found in <HI>Chalk</HI> by the name of <HI>Rust balls</HI> near <HI>Foulmore</HI> in <HI>Cambridg-shire,</HI> and in the <HI>Woolds</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> which upon due <HI>calcination</HI> would apply to the <HI>Magnet</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Mart. Lister de font. Med. Angl. <HI>cap. 2. §. 9</HI></NOTE>. Calling these things to mind, and that <HI>chalk</HI> was a substance as quite different from the <HI>Rust balls</HI> and <HI>Iron moulds,</HI> as <HI>Marle</HI> could be from these <HI>Rosemary stones,</HI> and as unlikely to produce any such effect: I resolved to trye both the one and the other, according to the prescription of <HI>Agricola</HI> cited by Mr. <HI>Lister;</HI> which I did with that success, that I found within an hour that both the <HI>Iron moulds</HI> and <HI>Rosemary stones</HI> did acknowledg the <HI>Magnet;</HI> whence 'tis plain that notwithstanding they were all found in beds of such dissimilar substances, that yet they are all certainly <HI>Iron-Ores,</HI> and these our <HI>Rosemary stones,</HI> of the <HI>arenaceous</HI> kind; part whereof upon <HI>ignition</HI> being made into <HI>Iron,</HI> owned it self such upon application of the <HI>Magnet.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. That <HI>pebbles</HI> as well as <HI>sands</HI> are also <HI>pyrites,</HI> beside their strikeing fire, we have this further evidence, that some <HI>pebbles</HI> at least are made out of <HI>Sand;</HI> wherefore if <HI>sands</HI> themselves are <HI>pyrites,</HI> the <HI>pebbles</HI> made of <HI>them</HI> must be so too. Now that some <HI>pebbles</HI> are made of <HI>sand,</HI> I was amply satisfyed at <HI>Bentley hall</HI> the seat of the Worshipfull <HI>Tho: Lane</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> (of which more hereafter) where I was shewn a large sort of oval <HI>pebbles</HI> of a reddish colour, dug up with the <HI>brick-earth</HI> near the <HI>dog-kennel</HI> poole, whose out∣ward coats were hard and smooth, but within containing only a bulk of <HI>sand</HI> equal to the intended <HI>bigness</HI> of the <HI>stone;</HI> some of them having little more than an outward <HI>shell;</HI> others harden'd half way; others ¾ stone, and <HI>sand</HI> only at the <HI>center;</HI> and some quite petrifyed; the <HI>induration</HI> seeming to increase gradually <HI>in∣ward</HI> in process of time, till at length the <HI>petrification</HI> is completed in the <HI>Center;</HI> just as I found it in the <HI>round flints</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nat. Hist. of Oxfordsh.</HI> chap. 5. §. 180.</NOTE>, which contain chalk within, and have coats thicker and thiner according to the seniority of their induration. As I suppose also
<PB N="156" REF="105"/>those white pebbles have, that contain a mealy substance in them, found about <HI>Treasle,</HI> which I take to be the <HI>Geodes</HI> of <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> or <HI>Aetites Plinii,</HI> 4<SUP>ti</SUP> <HI>generis, Taphiusius dictus</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>C. Plinii</HI> 2. <HI>di. Hist. Nat.</HI> Lib. 36. cap. 21.</NOTE>. Nor are these the only <HI>Examples</HI> that I have seen of this kind, for I have now a stone by me of a dark reddish colour, brought out of <HI>Northamp∣tonshire</HI> and given me by the learned Dr. <HI>Robert Pit</HI> fellow of <HI>Wadham College</HI> and of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> that has a firme coat without, yet is fill'd up within, with nothing but a loose <HI>sand;</HI> which whether a <HI>pebble</HI> or no, though I cannot safely say, yet I think verily I may, that it must be produced after the same manner.</P>
<P N="12">12. Yet Nature does not seem to use the same <HI>process,</HI> in pro∣duction of <HI>stones</HI> though of the same <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>colour,</HI> for in a ground call'd <HI>Castle-croft</HI> Northward of <HI>Nether-Pen</HI> in a red clay, the <HI>pebbles</HI> sensibly grow of the same colour with the earth about, but always commence their <HI>induration</HI> at the <HI>center,</HI> being gradually softer toward the out side, ending in a substance nearer to a <HI>liquid</HI> than the earth at some distance, which is more agreeable to the <HI>Hypothe∣sis</HI> of all <HI>stones</HI> having been once <HI>liquids,</HI> and of their <HI>augmentation</HI> by <HI>juxta position.</HI> The latter whereof seems to be strongly con∣firmed, by a <HI>firm pebble</HI> that was shewn me by my worthy friend the Worshipfull <HI>Francis Wolferstan</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> having a smooth hole through it about the bigness of a <HI>Rye straw,</HI> out of which He pick't the intire rind of some sort of wood which was rotted away, whence He rationally collected that the <HI>pebble</HI> must have grown round it. The same worthy <HI>Gentleman</HI> still prosecuting the same <HI>argu∣ment,</HI> sent me not long after another <HI>pebble</HI> with an incrustation of clay and sand mixt, adhering to it; whereby it was plain that stones doe contract other <HI>substances</HI> to them, and gradually convert them into their owne kind; and hence He most ingeniously shewed too, how it comes to pass, that even the <HI>pebble</HI> (as this was) is fre∣quently diversify'd with different colours, these being the <HI>stones</HI> of all others most lyable to be removed from place to place, whence they contract matter to them of different textures and qualities, and so consequently thence, are of <HI>various colours.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Whence in all probability the opake pebbles on <HI>Satnall hills,</HI> and all over <HI>Cank-wood</HI> have their variety of colours, these being places of great action, and so the stones the more likely to have frequent disturbance; than which I never sawany more plesantly variegated, or fitter for <HI>Cabinets, hafts</HI> of <HI>knives,</HI> or other <HI>Lapi∣daries</HI> work. Of this sort I was shewn severall finely polisht by the virtuous and most ingenious <HI>Iane</HI> Lady <HI>Gerard;</HI> and had others given me by the hopefull young Gent. <HI>Francis Wolferstan</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="105"/>jun. and his virtuous Sister Ms. <HI>Ann,</HI> of their owne gathering about <HI>Statfold;</HI> I had also another presented me with blewish veins, by a fair Lady at <HI>Lyswis:</HI> which all took so specious and elegant a gloss, that they seem'd at least to equal, if not surpass the <HI>Achat.</HI> But no more of these here, they being so very fine that they should rather have been reckon'd amongst the stones of <HI>Ornament.</HI> Nor have I more to add concerning this sort of stones, but that in the hollow way between the hills on <HI>Weeford heath,</HI> as you pass between <HI>Swynfen</HI> and <HI>Cannel</HI> yate, there lye divers little heaps of them, and one great one at the top of the hill at <HI>Weeford Park</HI> corner, which according to the tradition of the <HI>Country,</HI> was placed there in memory of a <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> who rideing thither with a large attendance, was set upon by <HI>Robbers;</HI> and <HI>Himself</HI> and all his men being slain, that these heaps of <HI>stones</HI> were layd where each dead body was found: whence by the <HI>Country</HI> people and <HI>travellers</HI> they are call'd the <HI>Bishops</HI> stones. But this is merely a fable of them, the truth follows, as I received it from the lear∣ned and judicious Antiquary Sr. Willam <HI>Dugdale</HI> Kt. <HI>Garter</HI> King at Armes.</P>

About the later end of the raigne of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8. or shortly after, <HI>John Vessy</HI> then <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Exeter,</HI> a man of a publick spirit, and borne close by, at <HI>Sutton Cofield</HI> in <HI>Warwick shire,</HI> resol∣ving with himself to become a <HI>benefactor</HI> to that place and the parts adjacent, procured for that <HI>towne</HI> not only a <HI>Mercat</HI> and <HI>fairs,</HI> but got it also incorporated by the name of a <HI>Warden</HI> and <HI>fellowship,</HI> building also a great number of houses upon the large wasts of that <HI>parish,</HI> intending to set up the manufacture of <HI>Kerseys</HI> there, as it was practised in <HI>Devonshire</HI> where he was <HI>Bishop:</HI> during these transactions at <HI>Sutton Cofield</HI> the good B<SUP>p</SUP>. was frequently thereabout, and finding the road above mention'd much annoyed with these <HI>rolling pebbles,</HI> which frequently occasion'd <HI>travellers</HI> horses to stumble and sometimes to fall, amongst others of his <HI>works</HI> of <HI>Charity,</HI> He hired poore people to gather them out of the way, and lay them thus on <HI>heaps;</HI> and this is the true reason they are call'd the <HI>Bishops</HI> stones. Which relation was given in, and testifyed for truth, in King <HI>James</HI>'s time, by a woman that lived at <HI>Black-brook</HI> hard by, who was examind upon a <HI>commission</HI> out of <HI>Chancery,</HI> then executed by one Mr. <HI>John Brandreth</HI> of <HI>Weeford,</HI> and others, concerning the extent of <HI>Common</HI> of the <HI>Parishes</HI> adjacent.</P>

</LIST> the two first whereof are seldom made use of, they are so very mean; the two middle sorts but indifferent; the two last the principal sorts; but <HI>Mush</HI> the best of all, some of it being a small comby∣stone, other some round and hollow, and many times fill'd with a briske sweet liquor which the <HI>Workmen</HI> drink greedily, so very rich an Ore that they say it may be made into Iron in a common Forge. Also at many other places, as at <HI>Cheslinhay, Red street, Ape-dale, Wednesbury, Darlaston</HI> &amp;c. they digg <HI>Iron-stone,</HI> the several measures whereof have also obtained different names, though gotten but at little distance from one another, which I forbear to enumerat, those above mentioned being sufficient, for a <HI>specimen</HI> of them.</P>
<P N="18">18. And thus I had finish't my account of the <HI>Iron-Ores</HI> found in this <HI>County,</HI> but that I think the sweet liquor that attends some of them, may deserve a little further consideration, whereof I recei∣ved a most accurat account from the Worshipfull <HI>Henry Legh</HI> of <HI>Rushall</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in whose lands, particularly in the <HI>Mill-meddow,</HI> near the <HI>furnace</HI> in the <HI>Park;</HI> in the <HI>Moss</HI>-close near the old <HI>Vicaridg</HI>-house; and in the <HI>furnace</HI> piece or Lesow: it is frequently met with amongst the best sort of <HI>Iron-stone</HI> call'd <HI>Mush;</HI> in round or oval blackish and redish stones, sometimes as big as the crown of ones hat, hollow and like a <HI>hony-comb</HI> within, and holding a pint of this matter; which according to the colour of the <HI>comb</HI> within (whatever the stone be without) is either <HI>red,</HI> or <HI>white,</HI> and whether the one or the other, of a sweet sharp tast, very cold, and cuting, yet greedily drank by the <HI>Workmen.</HI> The whitish sort whereof was also met with at <HI>Sherriff-Hales</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> by the ingenious
<PB N="160" REF="107"/><HI>George Plaxton Rector</HI> there, especially in that sort of <HI>Mine,</HI> the <HI>Country</HI> people call the <HI>White Mine,</HI> which yeilds the best <HI>Iron-stone,</HI> where the <HI>Workmen</HI> commonly upon breaking a stone find it inclosed in the <HI>Center,</HI> sometime to the quantity of a <HI>Hogs-head</HI> in one cavity, of a sweetish tast, but accompanyed with a <HI>Vitriolic</HI> or <HI>Iron like</HI> twang<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Philosoph. Transact. <HI>Num. 100.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="19">19. The same, as we find in that Letter of the inquisitive Mr. <HI>Iessop</HI> of <HI>Bromhall</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> communicated to the Royal Society by the learned <HI>Martin Lister,</HI> seems also to have been met with in a <HI>coal-Mine</HI> in <HI>Darbyshire</HI> 49 yards deep, by one Captain <HI>Wain</HI> a diligent and knowing person in <HI>Mines,</HI> who sent Mr. <HI>Iessop</HI> a whitish liquor, resembling <HI>cream</HI> both in colour and consistence, found there in great quantities<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>. Mr. <HI>Webster</HI> also acquaints us that an experienced <HI>Miner</HI> found it in a hard stone, by his direction, in the <HI>Lead-mines</HI> of <HI>Darby-shire,</HI> which was of a whiteish colour and some of it very thin and liquid, and some of it soft like <HI>butter</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Webster's Hist of Metalls <HI>chap. 3. p. l 51.</HI></NOTE>. What this substance should be, or whence it should come, none of the <HI>workmen</HI> or others that I discour'st about it, could give me satisfaction, and indeed it is hard to determin any thing in these <HI>secrets</HI> of <HI>Nature:</HI> but if I may have liberty to give my opinion which is not altogether groundless, I take it to be the <HI>Gur</HI> of the <HI>Adeptists,</HI> i. e. the matter of <HI>Metalls</HI> before it be coagulated into a <HI>Metallic</HI> form, or the <HI>Metalla in suis principiis:</HI> for taking some of this white liquor found in the <HI>Iron-stone</HI> at <HI>Rushall</HI> which I brought away with me and was now dryed pretty hard, and burning it in a <HI>Crucible,</HI> it was quickly <HI>maturated</HI> into <HI>Iron,</HI> and applyed to the <HI>Ma∣gnet;</HI> as I beleive that would have done which was found at <HI>Sher∣riff-Hales,</HI> and in the Coal-mine and Lead-Mine of <HI>Darby-shire,</HI> for though found in <HI>Mines</HI> of a different denominations, yet every body knows how frequently <HI>Iron-stone</HI> accompanys <HI>coale,</HI> out of which it might issue; and that possibly the <HI>stone</HI> in which this matter was inclosed in the <HI>Lead Mine</HI> might be an <HI>Iron-stone</HI> too, it being usuall for <HI>Metalls</HI> to be found mixt; though I must not deny neither, but that it might be the <HI>Gur</HI> of <HI>Lead,</HI> that being affirm'd to be of much the same colour and consistence.</P>
<P N="20">20. Of the above mentioned <HI>Ores</HI> they make severall sorts of <HI>Iron,</HI> differing in goodness according to the <HI>richness</HI> or <HI>poverty</HI> of the <HI>Ores,</HI> and haveing <HI>names</HI> somewhat agreeable to the qualities of each <HI>Metall.</HI> The first and meanest whereof, they call <HI>yellow share</HI> an ill sort that runs all to dirt and is good for nothing, and such is the <HI>Iron</HI> made of the <HI>Cannock</HI> or <HI>Cannot stone,</HI> the lowest <HI>mea∣sure</HI> of <HI>Iron Ore</HI> about <HI>Dudley,</HI> which is so very sulphureous and terrestiall, that its not fit to make <HI>Iron:</HI> this sort some others are
<PB N="161" REF="107"/>please'd to call <HI>Redshare,</HI> because says <HI>Dud. Dudley</HI> in his <HI>Metal∣lum Martis</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">D. Dudley's Metallum Martis <HI>p. 41.</HI></NOTE>, if a <HI>Workman</HI> should forge out a sheare of this for a plough, it is so brittle it would crack in the <HI>red-heat,</HI> so unfit is it to make a Husbandmans sheare. The second sort of <HI>Iron</HI> they stile <HI>coldshear</HI> which though it will not break when red hot, yet in <HI>hot heat</HI> or <HI>cold,</HI> the biggest bar of it may be broken with a small blow upon an <HI>Anvil,</HI> if it be perfect <HI>coldsheare Iron;</HI> the <HI>Ore</HI> for this <HI>Iron</HI> the have at <HI>Cheslin-hay, Redstreet,</HI> and <HI>Apedale,</HI> the worst and leanest being that from <HI>Cheslin-hay,</HI> the next from <HI>Redstreet</HI> being a red stone, and the best of the three from <HI>Apedale,</HI> being of a blewish colour, and call'd <HI>Boylom;</HI> yet these three are commonly mixt together, and sometimes with others <HI>stones</HI> to make them better or worse: the only uses that I could hear of for this sort of <HI>Iron,</HI> being to make small <HI>nailes</HI> not above <HI>two penny,</HI> and <HI>sheering nailes</HI> for ships having broad heads and short shanks, to keep the timber from being eaten by <HI>grubs.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. The third sort of <HI>Iron</HI> they make in this <HI>County</HI> they call <HI>blend-metall,</HI> of which they make <HI>nailes</HI> from three shillings to ten shillings, and all sorts of heavy ware, such as <HI>Hammers</HI> &amp;c. and in some <HI>Countries</HI> Horshooes; for which they have the <HI>Ore</HI> from <HI>Wed∣nesbury</HI> and <HI>Darlaston.</HI> The fourth and best sorts of <HI>Iron</HI> they call <HI>tough-Iron</HI> of which they make all sorts of the best wares, there being nothing so good but may be made of this, for which thy have their <HI>Ore</HI> cheifly at <HI>Rushall</HI> in the grounds of the Worshpfull <HI>Hen: Legh</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> They have some also from <HI>Walsall</HI> but not so good, whereof the several <HI>measures</HI> were enumerated above. Of the <HI>Iron</HI> made of these (I say) they make their best <HI>wares,</HI> either mediatly or immediatly, the best <HI>Iron</HI> of all being made out of the <HI>fileings</HI> and <HI>pareings</HI> of the <HI>Locksmiths,</HI> which they make up into <HI>balls</HI> with water, and dry them by the fire into hard balls; then they put it into the fire and melt it by <HI>blast,</HI> licking it up with a rodd of <HI>Iron</HI> as they doe <HI>glass</HI> at the <HI>glas-houses,</HI> and then beat it into a barr, which they use cheifly for <HI>keys,</HI> and other fine works.</P>
<P N="22">22. When they have gotten their <HI>Ore,</HI> before 'tis fit for the <HI>furnace,</HI> they burn or calcine it upon the open ground, with small charcoal, wood, or sea-cole, to make it break into small pieces, which will be done in 3 days, and this they call <HI>annealing</HI> it, or fiting it for the furnace. In the mean while they also heat their <HI>furnace</HI> for a weeks time with charcoal without blowing it, which they call <HI>seasoning</HI> it, and then they bring the <HI>Ore</HI> to the <HI>furnace</HI> thus prepared, and throw it in with the charcole in baskets <HI>vi∣cissim,</HI> i. e. a basket of <HI>Ore,</HI> and then a basket of <HI>coal</HI> S. S. S. where by two vast pair of <HI>bellows</HI> placed behind the <HI>furnace,</HI> and
<PB N="162" REF="108"/>compress'd alternatly by a large wheel turned by water, the fire is made so intense, that after 3 days time the <HI>metall</HI> will begin to run, still after increasing, till at length in fourteenights time they can run a <HI>Sow</HI> and <HI>piggs</HI> once in 12 hours, which they doe in a bed of sand before the mouth of the <HI>furnace,</HI> wherein they make one lar∣ger furrow than the rest, next the <HI>Timp</HI> (where the <HI>metall</HI> comes forth) which is for the <HI>Sow,</HI> from whence they draw two or three and twenty others (like the <HI>labells</HI> of a <HI>file</HI> in <HI>Heral∣dry</HI>) for the <HI>piggs,</HI> all which too they make greater or les∣ser according to the quantity of their <HI>Metall:</HI> into these when their <HI>Receivers</HI> are full they let it forth, which is made so very fluid by the violence of the fire, that it not only runs to the utmost distance of the <HI>furrows</HI> but stands boiling in them for a considerable time: before it is cold, that is when it begins to blacken at top, and the <HI>red</HI> to goe off, they break the <HI>Sow</HI> and <HI>pigs</HI> off from one another, and the <HI>sow</HI> into the same length with the <HI>pigs,</HI> though in the runing it is longer and bigger much, which is now done with ease; whereas if let alone till they are quite cold, they will either not break at all, or not without difficulty.</P>
<P N="23">23. In melting of <HI>Iron-ore</HI> some have great regard to the make of the <HI>furnace,</HI> and placeing of the <HI>bellows;</HI> which that the <HI>Reader</HI> may the better apprehend, He must be inform'd, that the <HI>hearth</HI> of the <HI>furnace</HI> into which the <HI>Ore</HI> and <HI>coal</HI> fall, is ordi∣narily built square, the sides descending obliquely and drawing near to one another toward the bottom, like the <HI>Hopper</HI> of a <HI>Mill:</HI> where these oblique walls terminat, which they term the <HI>boshes,</HI> there are joyned four other <HI>stones,</HI> but these are commonly set per∣pendicular, and reach to the <HI>bottom</HI> stone, makeing the <HI>perpen∣dicular square</HI> that receives the <HI>Metall;</HI> which four walls have the following names; that next the <HI>bellows,</HI> the <HI>tuarn</HI> or <HI>tuiron wall;</HI> that against it, the <HI>wind-wall</HI> or <HI>spirit-plate;</HI> that where the <HI>Metall</HI> comes out, the <HI>Timp</HI> or <HI>fore plate;</HI> that over against it, the <HI>back-wall:</HI> and these according as they may be pitch't less <HI>transhaw,</HI> or more <HI>borrow;</HI> will mend, they say, or alter the nature of the <HI>Iron;</HI> if <HI>transhaw</HI> or transiring from the <HI>blast,</HI> the <HI>Iron</HI> will be more <HI>cold∣shear,</HI> less fined; more indeed to the <HI>Masters</HI> profit, but less to him that has the <HI>manufactorage</HI> of it, and to him that useth it: whereas the <HI>Iron</HI> made in a <HI>borrow</HI> work, is much more tough and serviceable. Nor is the ordering of the <HI>bellows</HI> of less concern, which have usually their entrance into the <HI>furnace</HI> between the bottom of the <HI>Hopper</HI> or <HI>boshes,</HI> and the <HI>bottom stone,</HI> and are pla∣ced nearer or farther off according as the <HI>Ore</HI> and <HI>Metall</HI> require. Tis also of importance in melting of <HI>Iron Ore,</HI> that there be five or
<PB N="163" REF="108"/>six <HI>soughs</HI> made under the <HI>Furnace</HI> (as it is at <HI>Mare</HI>) in parallel lines to the stream that turns the <HI>wheel</HI> which compresses the <HI>bellows,</HI> to drain away the <HI>moisture</HI> from the <HI>furnace,</HI> for should the least drop of water come into the <HI>Metall,</HI> it would blow up the <HI>fur∣nace,</HI> and the <HI>Metall</HI> would fly about the <HI>Workmens</HI> ears; from which <HI>soughs</HI> they must also have a conical pipe about 9 inches at bottom, set to convey the <HI>damps</HI> from them into the open Air, which too otherwise would annoy the <HI>Workmen</HI> even to death.</P>
<P N="24">24. From the <HI>Furnaces,</HI> they bring their <HI>Sows</HI> and <HI>pigs</HI> of <HI>Iron</HI> when broken asunder, and into lengths, to the <HI>Forges;</HI> which are of two sorts, but commonly (as at <HI>Cunsall</HI>) standing together under the same roof; one whereof they call the <HI>Finery,</HI> the other the <HI>Chafery:</HI> they are both of them <HI>open hearths,</HI> upon which they place great heaps of <HI>coal,</HI> which are blown by <HI>bellows</HI> like to those of the <HI>Furnaces,</HI> and compressed the same way, but nothing near so large. In these two <HI>forges</HI> they give the <HI>Sow</HI> and <HI>piggs</HI> 5 severall <HI>heats</HI> before they are perfectly wrought into <HI>barrs.</HI> First in the <HI>Finery</HI> they are melted down as thin as lead, where the <HI>Metall</HI> in an hour thickens by degrees into a lump or mass, which they call a <HI>loop,</HI> this they bring to the great <HI>Hammer</HI> raised by the motion of a <HI>water-wheel,</HI> and first beat it into a thick square, which they call a <HI>half bloom.</HI> Then <HI>2<SUP>ly</SUP></HI> they put it into the <HI>Finery</HI> again for an hour, and then bring it again to the same <HI>Hammer,</HI> where they work it into a <HI>bloom,</HI> which is a square barr in the middle, and two square knobs at the ends, one much less then the other, the smaller being call'd the <HI>Ancony</HI> end, and the greater the <HI>Mocket head.</HI> And this is all they doe at the <HI>Finery.</HI> Then 3. the <HI>Ancony end</HI> is brought to the <HI>Chafery,</HI> where after it has been heated for a quarter of an hour, it is also brought to the <HI>Hammer,</HI> and there beat quite out to a <HI>bar,</HI> first at that end; and after that, the <HI>Mocket head</HI> is brought also 4. to the <HI>chafery,</HI> which being <HI>thick,</HI> re∣quires two <HI>heats,</HI> before it can be wrought under the <HI>Hammer,</HI> in∣to bars of such shapes and sizes as they think fittest for <HI>Sale.</HI></P>
<P N="25">25. Whereof, those they intend to be cut into <HI>rodds,</HI> are car∣ryed to the <HI>slitting Mills,</HI> where they first break or cut them cold with the force of one of the <HI>Wheels</HI> into short lengths; then they are put into a <HI>furnace</HI> to be heated red hot to a good height, and then brought singly to the <HI>Rollers,</HI> by which they are drawn even, and to a greater length: after this another <HI>Workman</HI> takes them whilst hot and puts them through the <HI>Cutters,</HI> which are of divers sizes, and may be put on and off, according to pleasure: then another lays them straight also whilst hot, and when cold binds them into <HI>faggots,</HI> and then they are fitting for sale. And thus I have given an account of the <HI>Iron works</HI> of <HI>Staffordshire</HI> from the <HI>Ore</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="109"/>to the <HI>slitting Mills,</HI> as they are now exercised in their perfection; the improvement whereof we shall find very great, if we look back upon the <HI>Methods</HI> of our <HI>Ancestors</HI> who made <HI>Iron</HI> in <HI>foot blasts</HI> or <HI>bloomeries,</HI> by Mens treading the bellows, by which way they could make but one little lump or <HI>bloom</HI> of <HI>Iron</HI> in a day, not 100 weight; leaving as much <HI>Iron</HI> in the <HI>Slag</HI> as they got out. Whereas now they will make two or three <HI>tuns</HI> of <HI>cast Iron</HI> in 24 hours: leaving the <HI>Slag</HI> so poore, that the <HI>Founders</HI> can∣not melt them again to profit. Not to mention again the vast ad∣vantage they have from the new Invention of <HI>slitting Mills,</HI> for cutting their <HI>barrs</HI> into <HI>rodds,</HI> above what they had an∣ciently.</P>
<P N="26">26. Thus I say the <HI>Iron-works</HI> are exercised in their <HI>perfection,</HI> and all their prncipal <HI>Iron</HI> undergoes all the foremention'd preparations; not but that for several purposes, as for the <HI>backs</HI> of <HI>Chimneys, Garden-rolls,</HI> and such like; they use a sort of <HI>cast-Iron</HI> which they take out of the <HI>Receivers</HI> of the <HI>Furnaces,</HI> as soon as it is melted, in great <HI>Ladles,</HI> and pour it into <HI>moulds</HI> of fine sand, in like manner as they cast the other softer <HI>Metalls.</HI> Thus the in∣genious <HI>Will. Chetwynd</HI> of <HI>Rugeley</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at <HI>Madeley</HI> furnace, cast <HI>Iron-Rolls</HI> for gardens, hollow like the <HI>Mills</HI> for <HI>Sugar Canes,</HI> of 5, 6, 7 or 800 weight a piece; the hollows whereof being fill'd with timber, and wedg'd up close, the other <HI>Iron-work</HI> of the <HI>Roll,</HI> is fastned to the wood in the same place as in other <HI>rolls,</HI> which are weightyer and more substantial than any other rolls I have elswhere seen. For such purposes as these, this serves well enough, but for others it will not, for it is so brittle, that being heated, with one blow of a hammer it will break all to pieces.</P>
<P N="27">27. And thus one would have thought, I should have done with the <HI>Iron-works,</HI> and all relating to them, as indeed I verily thought I had; but upon examination of a <HI>reddish stone</HI> very much like <HI>Cinnaber,</HI> very weighty, and being wet with the tongue, drawing red lines; found somewhere in the grounds of the worthy Mr. <HI>Wightwick</HI> of <HI>Wightwick,</HI> which I thought might have held some other <HI>Metall;</HI> upon <HI>calcination,</HI> according to the prescription of worthy Mr. <HI>Lister,</HI> I found it to apply to the <HI>Magnet,</HI> and to be no∣thing else but a <HI>Haematites,</HI> which for that reason he very rationally makes one of the <HI>species</HI> of <HI>Iron-Ores</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Listeri de Font. Med. Angl. <HI>cap. 2.</HI></NOTE>. And of this kind are the red stones found in <HI>Tene</HI> brook, which are also very weighty, and draw (being a little wet) red lines like <HI>ruddle,</HI> whereof I have a very large one in my <HI>Staffordshire Cabinet,</HI> given me by the truly <HI>Honorable,</HI> because truly <HI>virtuous</HI> and <HI>learned, Iane</HI> Lady <HI>Gerard</HI>

After the <HI>Copper,</HI> come we next to the <HI>Lead-Ores</HI> of this County, which also belong to this place; for beside that they cannot be said to be <HI>Earths,</HI> it is dug here in a yellowish <HI>stone,</HI> with <HI>Cawk</HI> and <HI>Spar,</HI> in <HI>Fowns</HI> field belonging to one <HI>Townley</HI> on the side of <HI>Lawton</HI> park; where the <HI>workmen</HI> distinguisht it into three sorts, viz. <HI>round Ore, small Ore,</HI> and <HI>Smithum;</HI> the two last whereof are first beaten to pieces with an instrument called a <HI>Knocking-bucker,</HI> and the <HI>Ore</HI> separated from the <HI>stone</HI> with another call'd a <HI>Limp.</HI> and then washt in a <HI>Sieve</HI> made with Iron-wyer; yet further to clear it from terrestrieties: which done, it is sold to the <HI>Potters</HI> at <HI>Burslem</HI> for 6 or 7 pound per <HI>Tun,</HI> who have occasion for most that is found here for glaseing their <HI>Pots.</HI> There has been <HI>Lead-ore</HI> al∣so dug at <HI>Ecton-Hill;</HI> where, some of it, lyes so near the day, that it was first found by the plough: Here also they distinguish't it into three sorts, but under different names from the former; the best being call'd <HI>Bing;</HI> the middle sort, <HI>Bowse;</HI> and the Lead dust, <HI>Smithum.</HI> And there was <HI>Lead-Ore</HI> dug formerly by the right Honorable the <HI>Earle</HI> of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> at <HI>Ribden,</HI> but none of these works were ever very considerable, nor is it likely any such should ever be found here, it being observed that wherever there is much <HI>coal,</HI> there is so much the less <HI>Lead,</HI> its sulphureous spirit being too strong for the production of that <HI>Metall:</HI> upon which account, when near <HI>Mendip</HI> there was found 2 or 300 weight of very good <HI>Lead-Ore</HI> growing to a vein of <HI>Coal,</HI> it was lookt upon by all, as a very great rarity<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Philosoph. Collect. Num. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="30">30. But nothing so great, as what was told me lately concern∣ing this <HI>Metall,</HI> by the Worshipful <HI>Philip Foley</HI> of <HI>Prestwood</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR><HI>viz.</HI> that notwithstanding amongst <HI>Metalls, Lead</HI> holds the third place after <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> it being lighter than <HI>Gold</HI> about a third part, and heavier than <HI>Silver</HI> about a fourth; yet that <HI>Anno</HI> 1682. there was a <HI>Leaden-Coffin,</HI> of one of the Honorable family of <HI>Skef∣fington</HI> of <HI>Fisherwick,</HI> laid in the Vault of St. <HI>Micheals</HI> Church at <HI>Lichfield</HI> (which as I noted before is frequently floated) that swam so cleverly in 9 inches water, that one might thrust it to and fro with a common walking stick; which he told me too, was actu∣ally done, by that judicious Gent. Mr. <HI>Swinfen</HI> of <HI>Swinfen.</HI> This, by the <HI>vulgar</HI> being look't upon as little less than a <HI>Miracle,</HI> I
<PB N="167" REF="111"/>thought it concern'd me, having occasion to spake of this <HI>Metall,</HI> not wholy to pass it by, but to let them know that it is so far from a wonder, that if the <HI>Coffin</HI> were so thin, and the body so consumed (as no question they were) as to be lighter than that quantity of water which is equal to the bulk of the <HI>Coffin,</HI> the rules of <HI>Hydrosta∣ticks</HI> require it must be so, and could no more be otherwise, than that a <HI>lighter</HI> body should not give place to a <HI>heavyer,</HI> which would have been a wonder indeed: No bodies whatever sinking <HI>deeper</HI> in water, than to that <HI>point,</HI> where the immerst part of the floating body becomes equal in <HI>bulk,</HI> to as much water as is equal in <HI>weight,</HI> to the whole body.</P>
<P N="31">31. Having done with the <HI>Stones</HI> holding <HI>Salts, Sulphurs,</HI> and <HI>Metalls,</HI> the next that offer themselves to my consideration, are such as only supply the <HI>necessities</HI> of Mankind in some peculiar manner; such as he diggs forth the <HI>Quarries</HI> for <HI>building,</HI> for <HI>grind∣ing stones, Mill-stones,</HI> &amp;c. of the former whereof there is plenty almost every where, within little distance, which for the most part as in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> is gotten and workt easy, yet endures the weather so well, that it improves in it, to a competent hardness: There are several sorts of it differing in grain and colour; some finer, some courser; some reddish, some white; some mixt of both those colours; and some streak't with black: about <HI>Lichfield</HI> they build chiefly with a <HI>reddish</HI> sort of <HI>stone,</HI> and so about <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and at <HI>Leek;</HI> at which last place they cleave it with <HI>wedges</HI> as they see the grain run, which is not always agreeable to the <HI>plane</HI> of the <HI>Ho∣rizon,</HI> or a little declining from it, but sometimes <HI>perpendicular</HI> to it. They have also a whiter harder stone, that is a good <HI>weather,</HI> but not a good <HI>fire stone,</HI> made of a finer grit, (as most white stones are than red) and working to a finer <HI>Arris.</HI> Much of this colour and consistence is the stone of the <HI>Quarry</HI> betwixt <HI>Ingestre</HI> and <HI>Salt,</HI> and about <HI>Beech;</HI> pretty white and hard, but not without a cast of <HI>redness</HI> here and there, and sometimes mark't with a <HI>yellowish</HI> sort of <HI>veine.</HI> The whitest and freest from any of those <HI>stains,</HI> be∣ing that dug at <HI>Fulford</HI> and <HI>Chappel Charlton,</HI> which are purely white, and of a fine grain enough.</P>
<P N="32">32. But it would be endless to enumerat the <HI>Quarries</HI> of this County, should I continue to prosecute such as those above menti∣on'd; wherefore I shall now restrain my self only to such as are some way or other more remarkable than others: amongst which I think I may reckon the <HI>Quarry</HI> at <HI>Penford</HI> in the Lands of Mr. <HI>Fowler,</HI> which lies in depth 14. or 15. yards as has been seen by many, some of the workmen assert it at least 20. yards thick, in∣deed they certainly know no bottom; the deeper they go the fin∣er the grit; and for colour it is <HI>whitish</HI> at the top, then <HI>redish</HI> to 10.
<PB N="168" REF="112"/>or 12. yards, and then whiter than at top, for 5. or 6. yards more; it being all of it good <HI>weatherstone,</HI> but not enduring the <HI>fire.</HI> As the stone of the <HI>Quarry</HI> in <HI>Purton</HI> park will, which is both a good <HI>weather</HI> and <HI>fire stone</HI> too, and so free from <HI>clefts,</HI> that a stone may be had of any Magnitude, as big as any of the <HI>Guglia's</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> nay I was told by one of the <HI>Masons</HI> that he could undertake to get a stone at this <HI>Quarry</HI> fifty yards long, and that but two or three years before I came thither, they actually had gotten one (though they had no occasion for any such) about fifty foot long: of these large stones there are very good examples in <HI>Purton</HI> house belonging to the right Worshipful Sr. <HI>Walter Wrottesley</HI> Baronet, a Person of that great reputation in his <HI>Country,</HI> that his memory will never dye; till Loyalty and Integrity, Prudence and Ingenu∣ity, be overborn by Faction, Impudence and Ignorance, and become unregarded, and of no esteem amongst us.</P>
<P N="33">33. The <HI>Quarry</HI> at <HI>Bilston</HI> is also very remarkable, it lying in beds in <HI>plano Horizontis,</HI> one under another, 12 beds deep; every bed being thicker then that above it, an inch or more; so that the lower bed is about a yard thick of which they make <HI>troughs, cisterns</HI> &amp;c. Some of the <HI>Tables</HI> of <HI>stone</HI> rising so large and even, that Mr. <HI>Hoo</HI> of <HI>Bradeley</HI> got one here 8 yards long, naturally so very even, that in the whole length it did not <HI>bevel,</HI> or depart from a true <HI>le∣vel,</HI> above an inch. Some of the <HI>stone</HI> dug at this <HI>Towne</HI> is also cu∣riously streaked black, whereof there are elegant patterns, in the <HI>Garden</HI> at the right worshipful Sr. <HI>Henry Gough's</HI> at <HI>Pury-Hall.</HI> I met likewise with a white stone thus mark't black, used in the building of the new <HI>Dormitory</HI> at <HI>Kingston</HI> Church by the right Worshipful Sr. <HI>Simon Degg</HI> Knight, but whereabout it was dug I must confess I forgot to ask, but suppose it could not be very far off.</P>
<P N="34">34. The stone of the <HI>Quarry</HI> above mention'd at <HI>Purton</HI> serves also for <HI>Grinding stones,</HI> which gives me occasion to treat of them next: which I find are esteemed so much the better, by how much they are made of a finer <HI>Grit:</HI> whence it is that the <HI>Grinding-stones</HI> dug near <HI>Biddulph-Hall</HI> of a red larger grit are not accounted so good as those dug at <HI>Heaton,</HI> a Village between <HI>Swithamley</HI> and <HI>Rushton Spencer,</HI> which are of a grayish colour, and of a fine small <HI>grit.</HI> But not so fine as those dug at <HI>Bilson,</HI> which are of so small a grit, that they are useful only for fine thin edg'd tooles, such as <HI>Knives, Cissers, Razers,</HI> &amp;c. and are better than the <HI>Grinding-stones</HI> brought out of <HI>Derby-shire,</HI> which are used chiefly for thicker edg'd tooles, such as <HI>Axes, Hatchets, Chisells, Adds, Twy-bills,</HI> &amp;c. Or those lately found, about 5 years since, at <HI>Over Arley,</HI> near the Par∣sonage house, and in the <HI>manor</HI> of <HI>Heck-stones</HI> adjoyning to the glebe
<PB N="169" REF="112"/>land, which yet serve for most sorts of <HI>Sithe-grinders, Smiths,</HI> or <HI>Cutlers</HI> wares, especially for those of the thicker edges, so that the trade to <HI>Darby shire</HI> for such <HI>Grinde-stones</HI> is quite ceased in these parts. Also in the lands of Mr. <HI>Persehouse</HI> at <HI>Cotwall-end</HI> they dig excellent grindingstones, as good as those at <HI>Bilson</HI> for thin edge tooles; and on the Windmill-bank at <HI>nether-Gournall</HI> in the same parish of <HI>Sedgley,</HI> they dig others for thick edg'd tooles, which must be of a grit both harder and courser; whereof some have proved as good as the <HI>Darby</HI> stones. Whether they dig any <HI>Grinde-stones</HI> now at <HI>Braunston</HI> or noe? I did not hear; though Mr. <HI>Er∣deswick</HI> informes us it was anciently famous for them<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Mr Sampson Erdeswicks view of Staffordsh. M. S. in Braunston.</NOTE></P>
<P N="35">35. Another sort of <HI>Grinding stones</HI> are those wee call <HI>Milstones,</HI> the Grit whereof need not be so fine, provided it be <HI>hard</HI> and doe not <HI>sweat</HI> in <HI>moist weather,</HI> which would both prejudice the <HI>Meale</HI> and clog the <HI>Mill.</HI> Of these some are made out of great <HI>loose stones,</HI> others dug out of <HI>Quarries.</HI> Of the former there have many been made out of great round <HI>pebbles</HI> found on <HI>Braden heath</HI> between <HI>Sherriff Hales</HI> and <HI>Blymhill,</HI> and so there has at <HI>Seasdon,</HI> where on the <HI>Heath</HI> there lye some <HI>pebbles</HI> so vastly great, that as I was told, there have 3 <HI>Mill-stones</HI> been made out of one of them. These <HI>Mill-stones</HI> out of <HI>Pebbles</HI> they use for grinding <HI>wheat,</HI> and some think them not short of the <HI>Colen stones.</HI> At <HI>Mole Cop</HI> in this County they dig them as in a <HI>Quarry,</HI> which they cleave from the rock with a great number of small wedges, driven with as small stroaks, least the stone should crack or flawe; when they have got it from the rock, they presently binde it round with a joynted hoop of Iron, which they call a <HI>Rivet-hoop,</HI> and this they straighten hard about it also with wooden wedges, driven in between it and the edg of the stone, that it breake not in the working.</P>
<P N="36">36. Which it so frequently does notwithstanding their utmost care, that there is but very few of them that are not made up of two or three pieces, thus bound together with a <HI>hoop;</HI> nay so very subject is it to crack and flaw, that whenever it happens that they finish one <HI>intire,</HI> yet it must be bound about thus with an <HI>Iron hoop</HI> to remain upon it even in the <HI>Mill,</HI> to preserve it from falling asunder in the motion. Nor is it any wonder that it should be thus, since it consists of a large angular shining <HI>grit,</HI> so knit together, that there are <HI>interstices</HI> between the parts, which are fill'd with a kind of <HI>mealy</HI> substance; this some people fancy tasts like <HI>meale,</HI> and amongst the <HI>Workmen</HI> the stone that ha's most of this (as it were by way of <HI>signature</HI>) is counted the best, though no question it must needs be so much the weaker. and yet as weak as it is, it lyes well enough in building, the parish
<PB N="170" REF="113"/>Church of <HI>Biddulph,</HI> which is a reasonable fair one, being built with it. These are seldome used for grinding of <HI>Wheat,</HI> because these grind Bran and Meal altogether, whereas the blew stones on∣ly bruise the husk from the floore; but chiefly for <HI>Rye, Barley,</HI> and <HI>Mault,</HI> or for <HI>shaling</HI> of <HI>Oates:</HI> nor doe they ever use two of these <HI>stones</HI> together, but always pair them with a white sort of <HI>Mill-stone</HI> brought out of the <HI>Peak;</HI> the <HI>Molecop</HI>-stone being always the <HI>runner,</HI> and the <HI>Darby-shire</HI> stone, the <HI>Legier.</HI></P>
<P N="37">37. Which is all concerning stones of any peculiar use, un∣less that I may have liberty to suspect, that at <HI>Rowley Regis,</HI> in the corner of a ground formerly part of the <HI>lower Moores,</HI> adjoyning to grounds call'd <HI>Freebody's,</HI> there must be that miracle of <HI>Nature,</HI> we call the <HI>Loadstone:</HI> For that, one Mr <HI>Deeley</HI> about 10 year agoe being appointed to measure the lands there, for the right honorable <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Ward,</HI> found that in that place his <HI>Needle</HI> varyed so very much, that his work was out of order, which put Him to no small trouble, till He began to suspect what must needs be the mat∣ter. <HI>Sept:</HI> the 23. 1680 for further satisfaction, having pro∣cured the company of the same Mr. <HI>Deeley,</HI> I was willing to make the <HI>experiment</HI> over again, wherefore seting up a <HI>stick</HI> with a <HI>hand-kerchif</HI> on it at one end of the ground, and goeing to the other with my <HI>Compass,</HI> I found the <HI>hand-kerchief</HI> to bear upon such a <HI>point</HI> of it; but removeing the <HI>hand-kercheif</HI> and <HI>Compass</HI> inter∣changeably, when I came to view the <HI>hand-kercheif</HI> upon the op∣posite <HI>point</HI> to that upon which I had seen it before, I found it wide of the <HI>mark</HI> by <HI>six degrees.</HI> So that upon consideration of the matter, I could not imagine how this should come to pass otherwise than by the <HI>Magnet,</HI> unless by some old <HI>Armour</HI> that might be buryed hereabout in the late <HI>civil War:</HI> Which might easily be determined, and at which end of the <HI>field</HI> this matter lyes, whatever it be, that thus affects the <HI>Needle;</HI> were the true <HI>Meri∣dian</HI> of the place first taken, and a <HI>touch't Needle</HI> hung upon a thred and carryed about: for whether it be a <HI>Loadstone mine</HI> that occasions this difference; or such <HI>Armour,</HI> or other <HI>Iron,</HI> that may lye hid hereabout; the <HI>Needle</HI> will discover it by <HI>diping,</HI> whenever it comes over it, or any where near it.</P>
<P N="38">38. After the <HI>stones</HI> of a restrained peculiar use, let us next con∣sider those of no use at all, at least that are put to none; which yet possibly may not altogether be unworthy our <HI>admiration,</HI> though no tolerable account, can be given of the condition, or present state they are in: and such are the vast <HI>Rocks</HI> or <HI>Roches</HI> as they call them, that bear no grass, but here and there a turf in some cleft or hollow, but standing as bare as a stone wall; some of them kissing the <HI>clouds</HI> with their tops, and running along in mountanous
<PB N="171" REF="113"/><HI>ridges</HI> for some miles together. The first of these I met with was on <HI>Wetley Moore,</HI> which at a distance I took for some prodigious <HI>ruins,</HI> these representing them as much bigger than truth, as the <HI>Floren∣tine stones</HI> doe it, less: but when I came to <HI>Leeke,</HI> and saw the <HI>Hen-Cloud,</HI> and <HI>Leek Roches,</HI> I was quickly undeceived, though my <HI>admiration</HI> was still heighten'd to see such vast <HI>rocks</HI> and such really stupendous <HI>Prospects,</HI> which I had never seen before, or could have beleived to be, any where but in <HI>picture:</HI> and that which yet fur∣ther increast my <HI>wonder,</HI> was how they should come thus bare, having no turf upon them, or earth to produce one: which whe∣ther so from the <HI>Creation,</HI> or uncoverd by the <HI>flood,</HI> or the per∣petual <HI>deterrations</HI> which have happend since upon <HI>rain,</HI> to all <HI>Mountanous</HI> parts, as was not irrationally conjectur'd <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. §§ 11. 12. of this <HI>History,</HI> is hard to account for. Though possibly too, some of them may come to be thus, first by cutting the turf from them which they use for <HI>feuel</HI> much in this <HI>Country,</HI> and then the <HI>deterrations</HI> by <HI>rains,</HI> will easily answer for the rest.</P>
<P N="39">39. And yet so far are these <HI>Roches</HI> from any further <HI>diminution,</HI> that I think some of them carry such evident marks of growth, that I cannot avoid beleiving it so. For in such <HI>rocks</HI> as these, as you pass through the hollow way at little <HI>Sandon;</HI> and in ano∣ther cut in the <HI>rock,</HI> about mid-way betwixt <HI>Draycot</HI> and <HI>Chedle;</HI> there are <HI>pebble stones</HI> plainly included in the <HI>body</HI> of the <HI>rocks,</HI> and so there are in the <HI>rocks</HI> near <HI>Alveton Lodg</HI> by the way side as you pass thither from <HI>Wooton:</HI> whence it must be concluded that these <HI>pebbles</HI> must have had a being before the <HI>rocks,</HI> and that the <HI>rocks</HI> themselves grew to be such, since that time. But the most indis∣putable evidence of the <HI>growth</HI> of such <HI>stone,</HI> we have from the inge∣nious Mr. <HI>John Beaumont,</HI> who tels us that at <HI>Daulton</HI> on the South side of <HI>Mendip,</HI> the Workmen <HI>sawe</HI> out of great <HI>blocks</HI> of stone of four or five Tun weight, dug in the <HI>Quarrys</HI> there, large pieces of fair cleft <HI>Oak</HI> included in the midst of them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph. Collect.</HI> Num. 2</NOTE> This I say is as in∣disputable a <HI>proof</HI> as any I have met with, except one at <HI>New-Castle</HI> under <HI>Lime</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> where at a place called the <HI>Gallow-tree</HI> (the ancient place for the execution of the <HI>Malefactors</HI> of that <HI>Towne</HI>) there was found, within memory, in a firm <HI>block</HI> of <HI>stone</HI> dug out of the <HI>Quarry</HI> there, an intire <HI>Skull</HI> of a <HI>Man</HI> with the <HI>teeth</HI> in it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereof Mr. <HI>Weever</HI> an <HI>Alderman</HI> of the <HI>Town,</HI> told me he had <HI>one,</HI> long in his possession: which place when used for <HI>execu∣tions,</HI> 'tis like might be nothing else but <HI>sandy Land</HI> wherein they used to bury the executed bodies, which in process of time has thus turned into <HI>stone.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1.

The <HI>mineral Salts,</HI> I say, are no less exercised in the curious <HI>formation</HI> of bodies in the bowels of the <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>rocks,</HI> than the <HI>volatile ones</HI> in the <HI>Hea∣vens;</HI> for it sufficeth it them not to represent only <HI>sublunary</HI> things, but <HI>celestial</HI> ones too, either by reflection, or in solid; as in the <HI>Se∣lenites</HI> and <HI>Asteriae,</HI> both which though rarely found in this <HI>County,</HI> yet those which I have met with here of each kind, are quite diffe∣rent from those, I ever met with elsewhere.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Selenites</HI> so called, not that it corporally contains the <HI>fi∣gure</HI> of the <HI>Moon,</HI> but only by representation, if obverted to it in right angles, as it were in a glass; as it will the <HI>Sun</HI> as well, and therefore otherwise more rationally call'd <HI>lapis specularis;</HI> is so ve∣ry rare in this <HI>County,</HI> that I could heare of it but in two places, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Hartley green</HI> and the village of <HI>Slindon,</HI> where it is dug in the Marle-pits: from the latter of which places I had a piece gi∣ven me by Mr. <HI>J. Serjeant</HI> of <HI>Mill-Meese</HI> of a different figure from all those in <HI>Oxfordshire:</HI> for the Stone <HI>Selenites</HI> though it have no∣thing of the shape of the <HI>Moon</HI> in any of its <HI>phases,</HI> yet it is com∣monly found in some <HI>certain figure</HI> always agreeable to the <HI>Salts</HI> of the body wherein it grows, as it does at <HI>Slindon</HI> in a <HI>Cubico-Rhom∣boideal</HI> form, all the pieces of it being constantly <HI>Hexaedra</HI> of equal <HI>obliquangular</HI> sides, or <HI>oblique angled Parallelepipeds,</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 11. <HI>Fig,</HI> 1. and upon that account as was conjectured in <HI>Ox∣fordshire</HI>

As for <HI>texture,</HI> these of <HI>Slindon</HI> seem to have much the same, with the <HI>Selenites</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and upon slitting (like them) briskly to represent the vivid colours of the <HI>Solar Rainbow,</HI> only the <HI>Scaiae</HI> of these are much more strongly co∣hering, and not so easily divisible, or into so thin <HI>plates,</HI> and there∣fore not so fit for many of the uses it was antiently put to, menti∣on'd in the <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> whither to avoid repetition I referr the <HI>Reader.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3.

As some stones have their <HI>figures</HI> from <HI>aerial waters,</HI> or <HI>dews,</HI> falling on <HI>nitrous steams,</HI> so there are others as likely <HI>formed</HI> by such <HI>steams</HI> and <HI>subterraneal waters;</HI> and such I take the <HI>Chrystals</HI> to be, found in diging in <HI>Barrow-hill</HI> in <HI>Pensnet-Chase,</HI> belonging to the right Honorable <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Ward,</HI> which I have not scru∣pled to stile <HI>Chrystalls,</HI> because many of them are composed of two <HI>hexagonal Pyramids,</HI> &amp; an intermediat <HI>Column,</HI> likewise <HI>hexagonal</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 11. <HI>Fig.</HI> 8. which according to <HI>Steno,</HI> is the very definition of a <HI>Chrystall</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Nich.

Some indeed of them seem only to be <HI>dodecae∣drums,</HI> having only one <HI>hexagonal Pyramid,</HI> and the <HI>hexagonal Co∣lumn;</HI> the other <HI>hexagonal Pyramid</HI> being hid in the rock wherein it grew, and left there, when the rest was broken off; which were the stones mention'd §. <HI>ult.</HI> of the former <HI>Chapter;</HI> but they are all (I believe) really <HI>octodecaedral</HI> when gotten intire, and true <HI>Chrystals:</HI> whenever therefore they appear otherwise, they may be suspected to be imperfect, and broken either in the getting or some other way. They are sometimes stained with a <HI>violacious</HI> colour, and perhaps may admit other <HI>tinctures</HI> sometimes, though it was not my fortune to meet with any of them; but they are or∣dinarily found of their own <HI>Chrystalline</HI> colour, the planes both of the <HI>pyramids,</HI> and <HI>Columns,</HI> being all naturally polish't.</P>
<P N="9">9. From the same <HI>Origin</HI> I think I must also deduce (because not able to assigne any better) another sort of <HI>formed Chrystals,</HI> shewen me by the same noble <HI>Lord,</HI> though shooting forth of his <HI>Limestone</HI> rocks, near <HI>Dudley Castle;</HI> whereof his <HI>Lordship</HI> was pleased to favour me with that large pattern, described <HI>Tab.</HI> 11. <HI>Fig.</HI> 9. in which though the <HI>Chrystalls</HI> are set very confusedly, yet
<PB N="181" REF="118"/>they are all strictly of the same figure, with that engraven a part, <HI>Fig.</HI> 10. made up as it were of 12. <HI>Pyramids</HI> joyn'd in base, all cut obliquely off at the top, makeing two <HI>hexagonal hedrae</HI> there, and 12 <HI>Trapeziums,</HI> which are so joyned by <HI>pairs</HI> at their broader ends, in the middle of each <HI>Chrystall,</HI> where they are consequently biggest; that the <HI>acute Angles</HI> of one combination, meet with the <HI>obtuse ones</HI> of the opposite pair, and divide each <HI>Chrystall</HI> with an indented ridg, as is evident to view in the forecited <HI>figure.</HI> Which though plentifull enough in the <HI>Limestone</HI> rocks here, yet is not mention'd, that I know of, by any <HI>Author.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. But though these <HI>Chrystalls</HI> may be supposed to have been made out of <HI>water,</HI> congealed by the <HI>steams</HI> of <HI>niter</HI> rather than any other <HI>Salt,</HI> because of its <HI>hexagonal</HI> shooting; yet I could ne∣ver hear that any of <HI>these,</HI> were ever found to include any <HI>water</HI> in the <HI>Center</HI> of them uncongealed, as some have been said to doe.

<P N="25">25.

<PB N="190" REF="124"/>must be a stone of its owne kind, is evident from its being striated like the <HI>fungi coralloides</HI> at the top of every cylindrical branch, from a very promanent sharp <HI>center,</HI> as in <HI>fig.</HI> 5. which the inner parts of <HI>reeds</HI> or <HI>rushes,</HI> neither of them are; the former being hollow, all but the joynts; and the latter having a <HI>pith</HI> altogether inform'd. So far are these stones from being <HI>petrifications,</HI> or ever having bor∣rowed their form from <HI>plants.</HI> As some <HI>stones,</HI> on the other side, as evidently doe: witness the <HI>petrify'd moss</HI> or rather <HI>Equisetum</HI> menti∣on'd before Chap. 2. § 114 of this <HI>book,</HI> and represented here <HI>fig.</HI> 6. which is so certainly nothing else but a petrification of <HI>Equisetum coralloides foliis mansu arenosis</HI> (whose leaves are always full of sand and therefore of excellent use for scouring of <HI>Glasses</HI>) that in the boggy ground above mentioned betwixt <HI>Sandon</HI> and <HI>Gayton,</HI> some of it may be had half petrify'd, and half remaining still verdant.</P>
<P N="27">27. Amongst the stones that have the shape of <HI>whole plants,</HI> we must also reckon one, found on <HI>Hall's</HI> furlong, at the village of <HI>Stansop,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Alstonfield,</HI> and kindly sent me thence by Mr. <HI>Rich.

<PB N="193" REF="125"/>set obliquely like a pack of Cards, end ways or edgways, ac∣cording as the <HI>striae</HI> appear long or short; and that the <HI>raies</HI> of the following <HI>Trochite</HI> are made also out of the <HI>edges</HI> of such <HI>Lamellae</HI> set obliquely too, but quite contrary to those of the former <HI>Trochite,</HI> and so alternatly; as may be seen in the <HI>edges</HI> of each <HI>Trochite,</HI> in the <HI>Entrochus</HI> graven <HI>fig.</HI> 13. though in some of them again the <HI>courses</HI> of the <HI>Lamellae</HI> seem not to be terminated within the <HI>verge</HI> of every <HI>Trochite,</HI> but (which is very surpriseing) though the whole <HI>Entrochus</HI> seem without side regularly divided into <HI>Trochit's,</HI> and radiated on the <HI>top;</HI> yet the <HI>courses</HI> of the <HI>plates</HI> pass some∣times undivided through several of them, so that they will not break off in the <HI>joynts,</HI> as I have made tryal upon divers; but in deep <HI>indentures</HI> passing through two or three <HI>Trochit's.</HI> Nor have they remarked, that upon breaking or scraping them, they emit a fetid nauseous odour, like the <HI>Wolf stone</HI> of <HI>Sweden,</HI> which the <HI>Lapis Ju∣daicus</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> or <HI>Palestine</HI> will neither of them doe; which is a probable argument that notwithstanding they appear outward∣ly to have the same texture of parts, yet that they must arise from far different principles.</P>

Sr <HI>Walter Bagot</HI> of <HI>Blithefield</HI> Baronet, that has four very near equidistant <HI>raies,</HI> much greater and more prominent than any of the rest, as in <HI>fig.</HI> 15. And I had another sent me by Capt. <HI>Jackson</HI> of <HI>Stansop,</HI> that has an invecked Line running through the <HI>raies</HI> near the <HI>periphery</HI> of the <HI>Trochite,</HI> as in <HI>fig.</HI> 16. Which are all the differences I have found in the <HI>Entrochi</HI> of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> relating to the <HI>raies,</HI> only that some of them, have <HI>ridges</HI> within side as well as without, with deep furrows between them, that are also <HI>striated</HI> from an open <HI>pentagonous bore,</HI> as in <HI>fig.</HI> 17. which too is a sort of <HI>center</HI> or <HI>pith,</HI> no where mention'd, that I know of by any of the aforesaid <HI>Authors.</HI></P>
<P N="34">34. The <HI>Entrochi</HI> of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> especially those of <HI>Beresford,</HI> are also much larger, longer, and therefore consequently compoun∣ded of more <HI>Trochit's,</HI> than either those of <HI>Yorkshire</HI> or <HI>Sommerset∣shire:</HI> for I have one by me, given me by the most ingenious Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> 3 inches &amp; ½ about, the center whereof is also full ½ an inch

And this is all I can find different from what they have observed con∣cerning this kind of <HI>Entrochus;</HI> but that in ours, those which have the thickest roundest <HI>joynts</HI> or <HI>Trochit's,</HI> such as the 11.12.13 &amp; 18 of Dr. Lister; and those whose <HI>joynts,</HI> as Mr <HI>Beaumont</HI> says, shew like a parcell of little <HI>Barrells</HI> piled upon another, have generally, if not always, the smallest <HI>bores;</HI> and those which the thinnest <HI>joynts,</HI> the largest.</P>
<P N="35">35. But both at <HI>Beresford,</HI> &amp; <HI>Stansop;</HI> &amp; about <HI>Heatley,</HI> and <HI>Bagots Bromley,</HI> they have another form'd stone, that seems with∣outside, to be made up of thick <HI>Trochit's</HI> that have no <HI>bore</HI> at all; nor have they any <HI>raies</HI> on the top issuing from any solid <HI>Center</HI> as in <HI>fig</HI> 18. which I wonder not at, since upon breaking and cut∣ing them, I doe not find they are compounded of such <HI>plates</HI> as the others are; nor doe they upon scraping or breaking send forth an odor: which different properties have induced me to beleive, that these may be rather the <HI>Columnettae</HI> of <HI>Imperato</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Historia Naturale di Ferrante Imperato Lib. <HI>24.</HI> cap. <HI>22.</HI></NOTE>, than <HI>En∣trochi</HI> composed of <HI>Trochit's,</HI> though like them, they will rather break in the <HI>joynts,</HI> than any where else. Another sort they have too at all the aforesaid places, that seem to be made up of <HI>joynts</HI> as the <HI>Entrochi</HI> are, but neither do the <HI>Trochit's</HI> appear round or square in their utmost <HI>rims,</HI> but sharp like the edg of a <HI>screw</HI> tapering from the place of their <HI>joyning,</HI> whence too they are only <HI>striated</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 13. <HI>fig.</HI> 1. so that the <HI>raies</HI> of one, doe not enter into the <HI>fur∣rows</HI> of the other, neither doe the <HI>Trochit's</HI> or <HI>raies</HI> joyn with the <HI>modiolus</HI> or center (which in these is a large <HI>cylinder</HI> of black flint) in right angles, as the former doe.</P>
<P N="36">36. Neither are these all of them <HI>cylindrical</HI> as the former, some of them <HI>tapering</HI> upwards from a broad <HI>basis,</HI> the lower most <HI>rings</HI> being the <HI>greatest,</HI> and so gradually in the ascent decreasing in ma∣gnitude, as in <HI>fig.</HI> 2. And so far are they from having suffer'd any <HI>accidental injuries</HI> (scarce any of them seeming to be crush't or dislocated, much less broken &amp; imperfect) that they are gene∣rally, if not always substantially terminated at each end, &amp; skreen'd as it were from <HI>harms</HI> by a <HI>cavity</HI> of hard stone, in which they are commonly found as in <HI>fig.</HI> 3. so that 'tis hard to conceive they were ever otherwise, since they shew not the least signe either of
<PB REF="127"/>
<PB N="195" REF="127"/>a <HI>root</HI> or <HI>top.</HI> Nay so very different are these from the former, that some of them have also a <HI>thin striated plate</HI> passing from the <HI>edg</HI> of each <HI>annulet,</HI> to the sides of the <HI>Cylindrical concave,</HI> as in <HI>fig.</HI> 4. so that there appears a fair <HI>cavity</HI> betwixt each <HI>ring.</HI> And some again have <HI>others</HI> included in them as in that represented <HI>fig.</HI> 5. inclosed, says Dr. <HI>Lister,</HI> like a pair of <HI>screws:</HI> how His might be I cannot tell, but ours are so far from the <HI>nature</HI> of a <HI>screw</HI> (more than in the riseing of the <HI>edges,</HI> from which reason only the <HI>Country</HI> people call them <HI>screw-stones</HI>) that they run not <HI>helically,</HI> but stand like <HI>annulets</HI> parallel to one another: nor doe the protuberant <HI>edges</HI> of the one, enter into the <HI>furrows</HI> of the other, as the male and female <HI>screws</HI> doe.</P>
<P N="37">37. There are divers others too found in the same <HI>places,</HI> and given me by the same worthy <HI>Gent.</HI> that stand fenced thus in <HI>cavities,</HI> some of them in the form of <HI>five columns</HI> barely joyn'd, as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 13. <HI>fig.</HI> 6. others bound together by thin <HI>annulets,</HI> not striated, standing prety thick and equidistant, as in <HI>fig.</HI> 7. Some again knit together by the same sort of <HI>rings,</HI> but by <HI>pairs,</HI> some distance interceding each <HI>pair,</HI> as in <HI>fig.</HI> 8. And others by <HI>four</HI> in like manner, as in <HI>fig.</HI> 9. To these add another sort fenced the same way, that are some of them <HI>cylindrical,</HI> of equal bigness from the bottom to to the top, curiously wrought with small <HI>rings,</HI> first with <HI>two</HI> at some distance, then <HI>four</HI> close together, then <HI>two</HI> again, and so 2 &amp; 4 alternatly, the whole length of the <HI>stone,</HI> as in <HI>fig</HI> 10. and o∣thers wrought in the same manner, but <HI>bigger</HI> both at <HI>top</HI> &amp; <HI>bottom,</HI> in form of a <HI>pillar</HI> with <HI>pedestal</HI> &amp; <HI>capitel</HI> as in <HI>fig.</HI> 11. Lastly there are some very small ones that stand in such <HI>cavities,</HI> like straight smooth <HI>pillars,</HI> only purled with a row of <HI>knobbs</HI> on each side; &amp; others there are that look like so many <HI>buttons</HI> piled upon one another: but many of these seem rather to be dacayed great ones than any thing else, the <HI>hollows</HI> in which some of them stand, being as large as the rest, though the <HI>pillars</HI> very small.</P>
<P N="38">38. Other stones there are formed like the <HI>fruits</HI> of <HI>trees,</HI> whereof I had one bestowed on me by the Worshipfull <HI>Walter Chetwynd</HI> of <HI>Ingestre</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in form and bigness, most exquisitly re∣sembling the <HI>bell</HI> or <HI>King-pear;</HI> in all points the same with that described &amp; engraven in the <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Nat.

And I had a stone given me, by a poore man of the <HI>Towne,</HI> found on <HI>Whittington</HI> heath, tho not so very like the stone of an <HI>Almond,</HI> as some one would wish, it having 4 or 5 ribbs running the length of the stone as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 13. <HI>fig.</HI> 12.
<PB N="196" REF="128"/>yet it being very agreeable to the <HI>Amygdaloides</HI> of <HI>Aldrovand</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ulyss. Aldrovandi Musaeum Metall. Lib. <HI>4.</HI> cap. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE>, and not easily referrable any whither else, I have ventur'd (with favour) to give it place here. And I must beg the same licence for another of this kind, though one of the greatest curiosities of this nature I ever met with, for notwithstanding it represents in gene∣ral the true shape of the <HI>bicapsular seed vessel</HI> of <HI>Digitalis ferruginea,</HI> or of some of the <HI>Ʋerbascum's,</HI> as may plainly be seen <HI>fig.</HI> 13. having that patilous fissure at the top, that the <HI>seed-vessel</HI> of that <HI>plant</HI> na∣turally ha's when it is ripe: yet in the most protuberant part near the bottom, it is perforated with a small hole, round which there are several <HI>striae</HI> or lineations bent (not equidistant) but according as the form of the stone does permit, which indeed are not found in the <HI>seed-vessels</HI> of that <HI>plant,</HI> but in all other matters it truly re∣sembles them, both in shape and magnitude: which being all con∣cerning the <HI>lapides</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but that this last was found at <HI>Be∣resford,</HI> and given me by the worthy <HI>Walter Chetwynd</HI> of <HI>Ingestre</HI> Esquire,</P>
<P N="39">39. I proceed next to the stones relating to <HI>Animals,</HI> and first to those of the <HI>Insect</HI> kind, whereof I have one sent me by Capt. <HI>Iackson</HI> of <HI>Stansop,</HI> so accuratley representing the <HI>combs</HI> of <HI>Bees,</HI> that the <HI>orifices</HI> of each cavity are all <HI>hexangular</HI> as in <HI>fig.</HI> 14. just as <HI>hony∣combs</HI> are. Others there are that seem to have been <HI>Reptiles</HI> petri∣fy'd, of which some, found at the same place, &amp; bestowed on me by the same worthy Gent. have the true resemblance of <HI>landsnailes;</HI> which because already described and express't in <HI>Sulpture</HI> in the <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Nat. Hist. of Oxfordshire chap. <HI>5.</HI> §. <HI>140.</HI> Tab. <HI>6.</HI> fig. <HI>11.</HI></NOTE>, are omitted here. And I saw part of a stone found amongst others in a <HI>Marle-pit</HI> between <HI>Aqualat</HI> house and the <HI>Park,</HI> that prettily represented a <HI>Mole</HI> or <HI>Want</HI> both in head and tail, but more especially in the foot, which was so very exact, that it was divided into claws, &amp; was like the foot of that <HI>Animal</HI> in all particulars. The learned &amp; ingenious <HI>Edwyn Shrymsler</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR><HI>Pro∣prietor</HI> of the place, told me also that there was found in the same pit, a stone resembling a <HI>dog</HI> couped about the <HI>reins,</HI> with nose and eyes so very perfect, and the hair standing up, as when that <HI>Animal</HI> is anger'd, yet without leggs; but this I did not see, it being some way disposed of, before I came thither. The same worthy <HI>Gent.</HI> gave me divers other <HI>stones</HI> found in the same pit; some <HI>Ʋmbilical,</HI> having the form of a <HI>Navil,</HI> as in <HI>fig.</HI> 15. others in odd unaccoun∣table shapes, yet having enough to shew <HI>Nature</HI> was designing somewhat. All which, in their consttutive parts, seem to be nothing else but a sort of petrify'd <HI>Marle,</HI> having all of them a small <HI>hole</HI> peirceing them in some part or other, whereby I suppose they re∣ceived

<P N="41">41. Of <HI>stones</HI> that are strictly like the <HI>parts</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> I have met with only two in this <HI>County,</HI> one found at <HI>Whittington</HI> near <HI>Lichfield,</HI> and given me by Mr <HI>Babbington,</HI> and the other at <HI>Drayton Basset,</HI> both so well resembling the <HI>foot</HI> of a <HI>child,</HI> that both may well enough be termed <HI>Andrapodites,</HI> and expressed in the same <HI>sculpture, fig.</HI> 20. they both seem to be of the <HI>pebble</HI> kind of a murrey colour, each between 4 &amp; 5 inches long, but differing somewhat in bigness, yet so exactly of the shape of a <HI>childs foot,</HI> that I doubt not they might serve well enough for <HI>lasts,</HI> for childrens first, and second shooes. Nor has <HI>Nature</HI> been content to imitate the <HI>parts</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> in <HI>stone,</HI> but to delight Him with the representations of many <HI>Ʋtensills</HI> of <HI>Art</HI> relating to Him, such as a <HI>Pipe</HI> for his <HI>Tobacco,</HI> found in the same <HI>Marle-pit</HI> near <HI>Aqualat</HI> abovemention'd; which as the worthy Mr. <HI>Skrymsher</HI> seriously told me, so well resembled that instrument both in the <HI>boll</HI> and <HI>heel</HI> (but broken off at about an inch long in the <HI>shank</HI>) that it needed nothing of the strength of imagination to help it.</P>
<P N="42"><PB N="198" REF="129"/>42. In the same Pit, was found another stone of a greenish-blew colour, with a <HI>bore</HI> through the middle, and <HI>furrowed</HI> from each orifice round the sides, like a <HI>Cloak button,</HI> as in <HI>fig.</HI> 21. which most certainly would really serve for a <HI>button mold</HI> of that form. Nor has <HI>Nature</HI> only provided <HI>Man</HI> with <HI>buttons</HI> to his <HI>cloathes,</HI> but with a <HI>barrell</HI> too, for his <HI>drink,</HI> as appears from a <HI>slone</HI> (were it hollow) found at <HI>Alrewas,</HI> and sent me by the worshipfull <HI>Iohn Turton</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> swelling in the middle and tapering at both ends, di∣vided with such equidistant lineations the whole length of the stone, as are usually made by the <HI>staves</HI> of a <HI>barrell,</HI> as in <HI>fig.</HI> 22. but having no <HI>hoops:</HI> however perhaps it may well enough deserve the name of a <HI>Cadites.</HI> She seems also to have furnish't Him with a <HI>Saddle</HI> for his Horse, if the <HI>Ephippites</HI> of <HI>Aldrovand,</HI> such as are fre∣quently found in the Mountains near <HI>Bononia</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ulyss Ald<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovandi Musaeum Metall.

<P N="43">43. But amongst all the things of <HI>Art</HI> imitated by <HI>Nature,</HI> there seem none to be so surprizing, as the <HI>rings</HI> of <HI>stone, Iron,</HI> and <HI>Copper,</HI> found about the <HI>stalks</HI> of <HI>Gorse,</HI> in the lands of the right Honorable <HI>Iane</HI> Lady <HI>Gerard</HI> of <HI>Gerards Bromley;</HI> which I doubted not at all, when She gave me the first relation of it, were so shewen to her <HI>Lady∣ship,</HI> but always feared an <HI>imposition</HI> by some waggish hand: till I met with parallel Histories from other <HI>Countries,</HI> of what had been found of the like nature both in <HI>stones</HI> and <HI>Metalls.</HI> The former whereof is amply confirm'd from <HI>Iamaica</HI> by the ingenious Mr. <HI>Stubbs,</HI> where He says they find plants with stony <HI>accretions</HI> about their <HI>boughs,</HI> which are often loose and moveable, as <HI>beads</HI> upon a string<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Philoseph. Transact. Numb. <HI>36.</HI> p <HI>701.</HI></NOTE>. And <HI>Bobuslaus Balbinus</HI> in his History of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> tells us that'tis so fre∣quent in that <HI>Country</HI> for the <HI>perfect Metalls</HI> to conform themselves to the nature of the things among which they grow, that <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> is found in <HI>stalks</HI> amongst <HI>Corn,</HI> in <HI>threads</HI> about <HI>Vines,</HI> and sometimes growing in the insides of <HI>Trees</HI> about their <HI>pith</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Beaumonts Weekly Mem. Numb. <HI>4.</HI> p. <HI>29.</HI></NOTE>. Now if so, why may not these <HI>imperfect Metalls</HI> (in a <HI>Country</HI> fruitfull of them) grow in rings without side the <HI>stalks</HI> of <HI>Gorse,</HI> as well as the <HI>perfect</HI> both without and withinside other <HI>plants,</HI> in other <HI>Countries.</HI> However, these <HI>Examples</HI> of natural <HI>rings</HI> growing about <HI>Shrubs, Trees</HI> &amp;c. afford me a fair introduction to the next <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Plants.</HI></P>

Having done with the <HI>Mineral,</HI> the order of <HI>Nature</HI> directs me next to consider the <HI>Ʋegetable Kingdome,</HI> the <HI>Plants</HI> of this <HI>County,</HI> whether Herbs, Shrubbs, or Trees; amongst which (as in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI>) I shall only treat of such as are Either
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. wholy underscribed by any <HI>Author</HI> we yet know of, or described but imprefectly.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. that have not been found by the learned Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> to be <HI>Indigenae</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. that have never till now been found to be <HI>Mediter∣ranean</HI> plants.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. that have any unusuall <HI>accidents</HI> attending them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. that are not commonly cultivated in the fields, where by the way, some of the <HI>Agriculture</HI> of the <HI>Country.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST> in which order, I shall consider all the aforesaid three <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Plants,</HI> as far as each of them will bear it, and then proceed to the <HI>Animal Kingdom.</HI> And first of the <HI>Herbs;</HI> such as have a <HI>carnous</HI> substance, and will never become <HI>lignous;</HI> of which those that are <HI>indigenous,</HI> &amp; wholy undescribed, or described but imperfectly, are these that follow.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Muscus multiformiter pyxidatus, capitibus sive apicibus coc∣cineis.</HI> Which beautifull Scarlet-headed <HI>Cup</HI> or <HI>Chalice-Moss,</HI> in its flourishing condition, is of an ash-colour, sometimes darker accor∣ding to the season of the year, and grows thick upon mole hills in in <HI>Cank-wood,</HI> about <HI>Wildmoore Hollies, Fair Oak,</HI> and <HI>Wolsely∣park,</HI> of the sise, and sometimes of the figure of a <HI>Clove;</HI> the <HI>Calix</HI> now and then being square at the top, and sometimes round, and oval; never very deep but always set round or purled with <HI>scarlet eminen∣cies</HI> about the bigness of small pins heads as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 14. <HI>fig.</HI> 1. which was first discover'd to me by the learned. and judicious <HI>Edward Brych</HI> of <HI>Leacroft</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and is so certainly an undescribed plant that I find nothing like it in any of the books: yet I cannot number this, nor any other <HI>Cup-moss</HI> amongst the <HI>plants</HI> properly so call'd as other <HI>Authors</HI> doe, neither of them produceing either <HI>flowers</HI> or <HI>seeds,</HI> that have been yet discover'd; wherefore I rather chuse
<PB N="200" REF="131"/>to reckon it among the <HI>fungus's,</HI> which ushers in another unde∣scribed <HI>fungus,</HI> that perhaps may not unfitly be stiled,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Fungus ramosus candidissimus ceranoides, sive digitatus mini∣mus, nonnunquam corniculatus.</HI> This white branched finger formed <HI>Mushrom,</HI> whereof some of the blades are curled round, divided and jagged like the Spellers of a <HI>Bucks-head,</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 14. <HI>fig.</HI> 2. found plentifully both in <HI>Chartley</HI> and <HI>Ingestre</HI> Parks, ascends from a conjunction of many small branches at the bottom, about 3 or 4 inches high, commonly straight and somwhat flat, each blade (especially the greatest) channell'd near the top. The most like of any plant yet described to the <HI>Digitatus</HI> of <HI>Parkinson</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Parkinson's Theatrum Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tanicum. Tribe <HI>14.</HI> chap. <HI>63.</HI></NOTE>, only none of the blades of his are divided or horned, which perhaps may be accidental; yet it cannot be either his <HI>major,</HI> or <HI>minor,</HI> or the <HI>Di∣gitelli</HI> of the <HI>Italians:</HI> which though a diminutive terme, are so large notwithstanding, that one of the white fingers (says he) will suffice a man for a meal. It remains therefore, that it must be an un∣described <HI>Fungus;</HI> and so must the</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Fungus pulverulentus, cute membranaceà, substantia intus spongiosa, pediculo brevi crassiori, in oras fere ducto.</HI> Which sort of <HI>fungus</HI> found near <HI>Packington,</HI> and first observed by Mr. <HI>Walter Ash∣more</HI> of <HI>Tamworth,</HI> and after on <HI>Alrewas-hays</HI> near the deep spring mention'd <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. § 51. by <HI>Francis Wolferstan</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> is very large, somtimes 4 or 5 inches <HI>diameter,</HI> and near two inches thick, and rises from a short thick pedicle, narrow at bottom, and extending it self broader almost to the brims of the <HI>fungus,</HI> like an inverted <HI>Cone</HI> as in <HI>Fig.</HI> 3. somewhat like the <HI>fungus tuberosus esculentus albus, fusco permixtus of J. Bauhin</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">I Bauhini Hist. Plantarum Lib. <HI>40.</HI> cap. <HI>16.</HI></NOTE>: and the <HI>fungus durus Ar∣borum sive igniarius</HI> of <HI>Parkinson</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Parkinson's Theatrum Botanicum Tribe <HI>14.</HI> chap. <HI>94.</HI></NOTE>. But can be nether of them, this being soft, and cover'd with a tough membranaceous skin, and the substance within much resembling a <HI>Spunge</HI> both in texture and colour; the <HI>Cavities</HI> whereof when it is ripe, are fill'd with just the same dust or fine powder, which flyes from the <HI>Lupi crepitus</HI> or <HI>Fuss-ball</HI> upon which account I chuse to referr it to that kind of <HI>fungus,</HI> though it differ much from any yet described in the <HI>pedicle,</HI> and carnous substance; which as Mr. <HI>Ashmore</HI> orders some of it, is much like <HI>Spunk,</HI> or the downy part of <HI>Artimesia Aegyptiaca,</HI> and I beleive if boiled in <HI>Niter,</HI> like the <HI>fungus igniarius,</HI> might be render'd as usefull <HI>ad ellychnia,</HI> as any <HI>fungus</HI> whatever.</P>
<P N="5">5. At <HI>Bentley</HI> in the <HI>park</HI> and <HI>lanes</HI> there about, at <HI>Oldfallings,</HI> &amp; almost any where within 3 or 4 miles of <HI>Wolverhampton,</HI> the <HI>Fun∣gus phalloides,</HI> or <HI>phallus Holandicus</HI> of <HI>Hadr.

The <HI>Volva</HI> which is some∣times bigger than a Tennis-Ball (and seems to draw its nourish∣ment by one or two small <HI>fibres,</HI> which are so tough that a man must pluck pretty hard to break them) is cover'd with a whitish tough <HI>membrane,</HI> which contains a thin <HI>pellucid gelley</HI> of an amber colour; under which there is another very white <HI>tunicle,</HI> that includes a dirty green <HI>farinaceous matter,</HI> which <HI>Bauhinus</HI> compares to the <HI>tunica elytroeides</HI> of the testicles;<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">J. Bauhini Hist. Plantarum Lib. <HI>40.</HI> cap. <HI>60.61.</HI></NOTE> and then a third, smooth on the inside next the <HI>cavity</HI> in the center of the <HI>Volva,</HI> and faviginous like a <HI>hony-comb</HI> or <HI>tripe,</HI> without; out of which last <HI>membrane,</HI> both the <HI>body</HI> and <HI>nut</HI> of the yard, seem to grow; the whole length of the <HI>scapus</HI> or <HI>coles</HI> being <HI>faviginous</HI> without, and <HI>hollow</HI> within (the <HI>Cavity</HI> tapering at both ends, and growing wider in the mid∣dle in proportion as the <HI>scapus</HI> does) and the <HI>capitulum glandi∣forme</HI> also <HI>smooth</HI> underneath and <HI>faviginous</HI> without, the <HI>Cavities</HI> whereof are fill'd with that <HI>dirty green</HI> substance, that lay next it in the <HI>Volva;</HI> which corrupting becomes liquid, and sends forth that fil thy stink, by the help whereof they are commonly found; though often too pass't by, upon that very account, many thinking it to be <HI>Carrion,</HI> lying hid somewhere near, and so heeding it no fur∣ther.</P>

Stand∣ing in the <HI>Sun</HI> or <HI>rain</HI> it seems to admit of no <HI>alteration</HI> from ei∣ther; all it has, proceeding from its self, which is very <HI>quick;</HI> its
<PB N="202" REF="132"/>whole <HI>duration</HI> (after they begin to stink, till which time they are seldom found) seeming not to be above 3 or 4 days. Near the <HI>phallus</HI> here described, were found two other <HI>baggs,</HI> full of the same sort of matter as the <HI>Ʋolva,</HI> joyned together with a tough <HI>fibre,</HI> having other <HI>roots</HI> or <HI>fibres</HI> issuing from it, as in <HI>fig.</HI> 5. which I take to be two distinct <HI>Ʋolvae,</HI> that had not yet sent forth their <HI>phalli,</HI> and not at all belonging to the intire <HI>phallus,</HI> but upon what account thus knit together, I must freely confess I doe not under∣stand.</P>
<P N="7">7. Which are all the <HI>indigenous plants</HI> either wholy undescribed, or described but imperfectly, that I met with in this <HI>County;</HI> and these too, only <HI>fungus's,</HI> plants improperly so call'd, having neither <HI>flowers</HI> or <HI>seeds,</HI> that we yet know of. Nor doe I much wonder at it; the most ingenious &amp; most industrious Mr <HI>John Ray</HI> having lived so many years in the confines of this <HI>County,</HI> and no doubt searched it diligently. However I heard of one growing on the pa∣per-Mill dam poole in <HI>Heywood</HI> park, though described by other <HI>Au∣thors,</HI> yet not noted by that worthy person to be of <HI>English</HI> growth, viz. <HI>Tithymalus Characias Monspeliensis,</HI> or sweet wood-<HI>Spurge,</HI> the Eighth of <HI>Gerard</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Gerard's Hist of Plants enlarged by Johnson Lib. <HI>2.</HI> chap <HI>139.</HI></NOTE>; or great French wood-Spurge, the Second of <HI>Parkinson</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Parkinson's Theatrum Botamcum Trib. <HI>2.</HI> chap. <HI>16.</HI></NOTE>, which seem by the <HI>Cuts</HI> to be much the same, and are so well described by both those <HI>Authors,</HI> that I shall supersede any here.</P>
<P N="8">8. And as for such as were never found till now to be <HI>Mediterra∣nean plants,</HI> my worthy friend Mr. <HI>Charles King, Student</HI> of <HI>Ch. Ch. Oxon:</HI> and <HI>Chaplin</HI> to Mr. <HI>Chetwynd,</HI> shewed me the <HI>Turbith</HI> of <HI>Se∣rapio,</HI> the <HI>Tripolium vulgare minus,</HI> or at least the <HI>Tripolium minus Germanicum,</HI> the <HI>Sea Starr-wort</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> well described, and whereof there seems to be a good Cut in <HI>Johnsons</HI> enlargement of <HI>Gerards</HI> History of Plants. Which though generally said to grow upon the <HI>Sea-coasts,</HI> especially in <HI>Salt marshes</HI> where the <HI>tide</HI> eb∣beth and floweth, as <HI>Lobel</HI> saith the <HI>Tripolium vulgare minus</HI> doth at the mouth of the River <HI>Po</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Matthiae de Lobel Plantarum &amp; Stirpium Hist. pag. <HI>158.</HI></NOTE>, and <HI>Johnson</HI> at the foot of the fort at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> in the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Sheppey,</HI> and near <HI>Sandwich</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> all near to <HI>Salt marshes</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Johnson upon Gerard Lib. <HI>2.</HI> chap. <HI>93.</HI></NOTE>; yet here it is found in an inland <HI>Country,</HI> at least 50 miles from the <HI>Sea,</HI> in the grounds of the worthy Mr. <HI>Chetwynd</HI> of <HI>Ingestre,</HI> within two miles of <HI>Stafford;</HI> and yet not much to be wonder'd at neither: for though found thus in a <HI>Medi∣terranean Country,</HI> so far from the <HI>Sea,</HI> it seems not at all to have been out of its natural aboad: for it grows here in a ground call'd the <HI>Marsh,</HI> mentiond before in this <HI>Hist. Chap.</HI> 2. §. 112. near the
<PB N="203" REF="132"/>place where the <HI>brine</HI> of it self breaks out above ground, frets away the grass, and makes a plash of <HI>Salt-water.</HI> Just as <HI>Cordus</HI> saith the <HI>Tripolium minus Germanicum,</HI> or <HI>Anthyllis,</HI> groweth in the <HI>Salt Marshes,</HI> that are nigh unto a <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>brackish water,</HI> near <HI>Staffurt</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> which in all probability too is an inland <HI>Towne</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Val. Cordi Variar. Observat. Sylvâ p. <HI>222.</HI></NOTE>; as if this plant were confin'd to grow in places of the like situation and name, though in <HI>inland Countries,</HI> and far remote from the places of its usual growth.</P>
<P N="9">9. As for extraordinary <HI>Accidents,</HI> that have happen'd amongst the <HI>indigenous herbaceous plants</HI> I have met with but few; and those I suppose arising cheifly, either from the <HI>soile;</HI> or from the <HI>season</HI> wherein the <HI>seed</HI> of them was sowne; or from some other <HI>external accidents.</HI> From the first whereof, it most certainly comes to pass, that <HI>plants</HI> sometimes produce <HI>flowers</HI> of different <HI>colours</HI> from what they usually doe; as I have reason to suspect a <HI>Digitalis</HI> or <HI>Fox-glove</HI> that I found by the way side near <HI>Norton</HI> in the <HI>Moors</HI> might possibly doe, from the <HI>poverty</HI> of the <HI>Soile</HI> there about, which ordinarily produces a <HI>preternatural whiteness,</HI> as was fully shewn in the <HI>Nat. Hist.</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nat. Hist. of Oxfordsh. Chap.</HI> 6. §. §. 17, 18, 19, 20. <HI>and</HI> 38.</NOTE>. Or else that the <HI>seed</HI> of this <HI>plant</HI> by some casualty or other, was not committed to the <HI>Earth</HI> in <HI>due time,</HI> which experience ha's taught us will make the same alteration in the <HI>colour</HI> of <HI>flowers</HI> as was found by that most skill∣full <HI>Botanist</HI> Mr. <HI>Jacob Bobart</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who seriously told me He once sowed <HI>stock-Gillo-flower</HI> seeds in the <HI>Spring</HI> which produc∣ed <HI>red</HI> flowers, and others again three months after, out of the same paper of seeds, which brought all <HI>white</HI> ones: so very nicely doth the <HI>colour</HI> of <HI>flowers</HI> depend, upon the agreeableness of the <HI>season,</HI> as well as <HI>soile.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Nay so very unaccountable are the <HI>colours</HI> of the <HI>flowers</HI> of <HI>plants,</HI> that as the same <HI>worthy person</HI> told me more than once, from the <HI>seeds</HI> of the same <HI>Anemone,</HI> which was all of the <HI>same colour,</HI> and sowne in the <HI>same place,</HI> were produced <HI>Anemone's</HI> of as great variety of <HI>colours,</HI> as if He had sown a <HI>mixt seed</HI> from divers: to which I can further add, that <HI>flowers</HI> of two different colours shall sometimes grow upon the same <HI>stalk,</HI> which may well be presumed to come from the same <HI>individual seed;</HI> as I was shewn it by an excellent <HI>Florist</HI> at <HI>Bescot</HI> in this <HI>County</HI> in the <HI>Caryophyllus hortensis,</HI> where there grew a <HI>red one</HI> and a <HI>white,</HI> on the same <HI>stalk:</HI> which whether to be attributed to the <HI>seed,</HI> or <HI>soil,</HI> seems to be an insuperable difficulty. Much more certain is it, that the <HI>thickness</HI> of the <HI>husks</HI> of the <HI>Corn</HI> of this <HI>County,</HI> which is another <HI>accident,</HI> proceeds solely from the <HI>soile</HI> it being held here for a
<PB N="204" REF="133"/>certain <HI>Rule,</HI> that the colder any <HI>Country</HI> is, the thicker will the <HI>husk</HI> of any sort of <HI>grain</HI> be; as if <HI>Nature</HI> defigned to fence it against the <HI>severity</HI> of the <HI>Clime.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. And these are all the <HI>accidents</HI> relating to <HI>Herbaceous Plants,</HI> I met with in this <HI>Country;</HI> except we may reckon un∣timely flowring, and bearing of fruit, for one; such as hap∣pended in the garden of one Mr. <HI>Jobber</HI> of <HI>Acton-Trussell,</HI> who had once <HI>Strawberrys</HI> fresh and fragrant three dayes before <HI>Christmass:</HI> the same I once saw in <HI>Merton College</HI> garden in the University of <HI>Oxford.</HI> The reason whereof because not so commonly known, has the rather induced me to mention it here, and to let the <HI>Reader</HI> know that this may come to pass no less then two ways. 1. By <HI>Nipping</HI> the <HI>Budds</HI> before they come to <HI>Flower,</HI> and so put∣ting them so far back, that they cannot recover this <HI>injury</HI> so as to produce their <HI>Fruit</HI> before the season above mention'd. Or else 2. By <HI>Transplantation,</HI> which is much the better and surer way, if one designe to have <HI>Fruits</HI> out of season (for the <HI>Budds</HI> nip't, sometimes will never make a second attempt,) thus <HI>Straw∣berrys</HI> transplanted before they <HI>Flower,</HI> and transplanted again in <HI>Autumn,</HI> if the Winter prove mild and temperate (which is ab∣solutely necessary in both cases,) they may and doe perhaps, more frequently then noted, produce their <HI>Fruit</HI> about that time of year.</P>
<P N="12">12. Of unusual <HI>Herbaceous Plants</HI> now cultivated in the fields, the <HI>Vicia Sylvestris, sive Cracca,</HI> the wild <HI>Vetch,</HI> here call'd <HI>Tar∣grass</HI> has been observed in some parts to doe so well in <HI>Meddows,</HI> that it advances all starven weak Cattle above any thing yet known. And the <HI>Pisum album majus</HI> or garden-<HI>Rouncival</HI> has been sown in the common fields in the Parish of <HI>Millwich,</HI> which notwithstanding their great length, were found to run upon the ground without inconvenience, and to kern well. This as I was in∣formed was first attempted by <HI>Matthew Philips</HI> of <HI>Coton</HI> in that Parish, with such success, that at first he sold these <HI>Peas</HI> for ten Shillings the Bushell in many other places in the <HI>Vicinage,</HI> to such Neighbours as were satisfyed with the advantage of his good husbandry.</P>
<P N="13">13. At Mr. <HI>Traffords</HI> of <HI>Swythamley</HI> in the most Northerly <HI>Moore∣lands,</HI> I was first told (but found them almost every where else,) of a sort of <HI>red-Oate</HI> sowne thereabout, which upon exami∣nation I found indeed quite different from any sort of <HI>Oate</HI> any where cultivated in the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> the grain being redder, larger, and fuller of Flower, and requiring a stronger Soile then other <HI>Oats</HI> doe, of which they make their best <HI>oaten</HI> bread in that <HI>Country.</HI> And at <HI>Burton</HI> upon <HI>Trent</HI> I was shewed by one Mr.
<PB N="205" REF="133"/><HI>Tomlinson</HI> the <HI>Avena nuda</HI> or naked Oat, sown there by Him that very year, which grows in all points like other <HI>Oates,</HI> saving that they are much smaller, without husk, and are indeed perfect <HI>gritts</HI> naturally, requiring no Mill to make them into <HI>Oatemeal,</HI> as all other <HI>Oates</HI> doe.</P>
<P N="14">14. To which I may add <HI>Zeopyrum, Tritico-speltum,</HI> or <HI>Hor∣deum nudum,</HI> naked barley, which I found sown at <HI>Brocton</HI> and <HI>Ellarton grange,</HI> where they otherwise call it <HI>Bare-barley,</HI> I sup∣pose because without <HI>husk;</HI> and <HI>Wheat-barley,</HI> because though its <HI>Eare</HI> be shaped like <HI>barley,</HI> its <HI>grain</HI> is like <HI>Wheat,</HI> without any husk. For which very reason the <HI>Latins</HI> have termed it <HI>Tritico∣speltum,</HI> it having the stalk, joynts, and bearded Eare of the true <HI>Zea</HI> or <HI>Spelt</HI> of <HI>Lugdunensis</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Gul. Rovilii Lugdimens. Hist. Plantarum Lib. <HI>4.</HI> cap. <HI>4.</HI></NOTE>, though the Corn be like Wheat, and not husked, as all <HI>Spelt</HI> is. At <HI>Rowley</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Ham∣stall Ridware</HI> where it is also sown, they call it <HI>French-barley,</HI> be∣cause so like that which we buy in the <HI>shops</HI> under that name. In short it is a plant between <HI>wheat</HI> and <HI>barley,</HI> in goodness as well as form; it giving a flower, as worse then <HI>wheat,</HI> so better then <HI>barley;</HI> and is therefore sown that it may be used instead of <HI>wheat</HI> (for bread,) in a scarcity, and by the poorer sort at any time. It runs to <HI>malt</HI> as well as other <HI>barley,</HI> and makes a good sort of drink: but the great advantage lyes in the <HI>increase,</HI> it pro∣ducing sometimes in an agreeable soile near twenty fold.</P>
<P N="15">15. Yet a more improper sort of <HI>wheat</HI> then that above men∣tion'd, is sown in the barren hungry lands of this <HI>County,</HI> viz. <HI>Ocymum Cereale sive Tragopyrum,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Buck-wheat,</HI> not that it has any likeness either in the herbage or grain to any sort of <HI>wheat,</HI> but I suppose because the Seed of it serveth a∣mong the meaner sort for the same use, for making of bread. It is sown either alone, or mixt with other corn, as I saw it mixt with <HI>barley</HI> on <HI>Heyley-Castle</HI> hill, and so it is made into bread and eaten; which though less nourishing then <HI>Wheat, Rye,</HI> or <HI>barley,</HI> yet more then <HI>Millet,</HI> or <HI>Panick;</HI> and that nourish∣ment good: for the Country People of divers places in <HI>Germa∣ny</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> feed only upon this, and yet are strong and fit for the hardest labour. It digests easily and fattens quickly, espe∣cially <HI>Cattle</HI> and <HI>Poultry,</HI> which if not speedily kill'd after they are thus fatted, 'tis said, will dye of themselves, suffocated with their own fat.</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Triticum multiplex</HI> or double-eard <HI>wheat,</HI> described in <HI>Ox∣fordshire</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Nat. Hist. of Oxfordsh. Chap. <HI>6.</HI> §. <HI>27.</HI></NOTE>, has been also sown at <HI>Rowley Regis</HI> in this <HI>County</HI> by <HI>Hen. Warrant</HI> tenant to Mr. <HI>Amphlet</HI> of <HI>N. Clent.</HI> And
<PB N="206" REF="134"/>in <HI>Worcestershire</HI> and the S. W. parts of this <HI>County, Triticum Polonicum, sive Triticum spica albicante aliqualiter aristata, glumis foleaceis sive folliculis avenaceis, granis rufescentibus,</HI> has been some∣times sown: and I was told by one at <HI>Hilderstone</HI> An. 1681. That he intended to sow it there the year following. This sort of <HI>wheat</HI> generally received by the name of <HI>Poland,</HI> is presumed original∣ly to have come from thence; which rising from a fibrous root, grows 4 or 5 foot high more or less according to the quality of the land, with a larger stalk, and leaves, then other <HI>wheats</HI> usually have; bearing at the top a long Eare, with long spreading folea∣ceous husks, each about an Inch long; amongst which about the bottom grows the <HI>grain,</HI> which is longer and thicker then any other <HI>wheat;</HI> and is ordinarily some of it found to divide its <HI>Ear</HI> into smaller ones toward the lower part, somewhat like <HI>Triticum multiplex.</HI> Which being no where described that I yet know of, I have here caused to be graven <HI>Tab.</HI> 14. <HI>Fig.</HI> 6. And should have been numbred amongst the <HI>undescribed plants</HI> in the beginning of this <HI>Chapter,</HI> but that it is no native of <HI>England,</HI> and only cultivated here.</P>
<P N="17">17. After the <HI>herbaceous plants</HI> I should have proceeded next to the undescribed <HI>Shrubbs,</HI> had I met with any in the <HI>County,</HI> but having failed therein, I immediatly apply my self, to those not noted by Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> to be of <HI>English</HI> growth: whereof I met only the <HI>Sambucus fructu albo,</HI> growing plentifully in the hedges near the Village of <HI>Combridg,</HI> which differs not at all from the common Elder, in the growth, pith, scent, leaves, or flowers; only in the colour of the fruit and rind; which last in this, is also somewhat whiter. This says <HI>Parkinson,</HI> was first found by <HI>Tragus,</HI> in the Woods of <HI>Germany,</HI> not so much as imagining it grew any where in <HI>England:</HI> but I hear it grows also somewhere near <HI>Maidstone</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> as well as here at <HI>Combridg.</HI> The <HI>accidents</HI> attending <HI>shrubbs,</HI> also are not many, nor very considerable ones neither. At the Honorable <HI>Harry Grays</HI> of <HI>Enfield</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> there grows a <HI>Woodbine</HI> in the garden 6 or 7 foot high, having several substantial branches, altogether indepen∣dent of any support. And at <HI>Millwich</HI> at the South end of the <HI>Vicaridg</HI> house, grows an <HI>Ivy Bush</HI> which ascending to the top of the roof and twisting it self about a wooden pinnacle there, and having no higher support, after spreads into branches like an <HI>Oak</HI> or <HI>Elm,</HI> and carrys a fine round top standing of its self like the <HI>Cissos</HI> of <HI>Pliny</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">C.

Thus having dispatch't both <HI>herbs</HI> and <HI>Shrubbs,</HI> I come at length to the <HI>Trees;</HI> amongst which some will needs have St. <HI>Bertram's</HI> Ash, that growes over a <HI>spring</HI> which bears the name of the same <HI>Saint,</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Ilam,</HI> to be of a different un∣described <HI>species</HI> from all others; and indeed it has a narrower sharper leaf, then ever I saw any: but whether this may not be ascribed to the <HI>age</HI> and <HI>decay</HI> of the tree, I much suspect. However it be, 'tis certain the common people superstitiously beleive, that tis very dangerous to break a bough from it; so great a care has St. <HI>Bertram</HI> of his <HI>Ash</HI> to this very day. And yet they have not so much as a <HI>Legend</HI> amongst them, either of this <HI>Saints</HI> miracles, or what he was; onely that he was <HI>Founder</HI> of their <HI>Church,</HI> where they shew you his <HI>Monument;</HI> of which I shall endeavour some account in the <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Antiquities.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. Much rather should I think the <HI>yellow Yew</HI> near <HI>Smethwick</HI> Hall to be an <HI>undescribed Tree,</HI> which has some branches with all the leaves of a bright <HI>yellow</HI>- colour: this I though at first might proceed from some <HI>disease,</HI> or that those branches might have been wounded; but upon examination I found them all found: Nay so far was this part of the tree from weakness, that it had <HI>berrys</HI> on it, when the <HI>green</HI> part had none; and yet it differing from other <HI>Yew-trees</HI> only in colour, and not in any of the <HI>Essentials;</HI> I can neither afford to pronounce it a distinct <HI>species,</HI> not allow it for an <HI>undescribed plant;</HI> the difference seeming but <HI>accidental,</HI> though perhaps hard enough to be accounted for.</P>
<P N="21">21. As I suppose the <HI>spots</HI> may be upon the <HI>leaves</HI> of a <HI>birch</HI> in the Copice South of <HI>Ranton Abbey,</HI> which in the spring time are as red and shining as if <HI>fresh blood</HI> had fallen on them; upon which account it is reasonably enough call'd the <HI>bloody Birch:</HI> in
<PB N="208" REF="135"/><HI>August</HI> indeed when I was there, the <HI>spots</HI> were of a somewhat darker hue; and the tree standing under an <HI>Oak,</HI> I suspected they might be caused from the dropping thence: but the <HI>hasells,</HI> and other underwood standing close by it, having no such matter on them; unless there be some secret quality betwixt an <HI>Oak</HI> and a <HI>birch</HI> that produces this dye, I cannot conceive how it should come to pass. However this is certain, that here is no sufficient ground to multiply the <HI>species.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22. No more then there is for a sort of <HI>thorn</HI> that grows in a hedgrow <HI>Westerly</HI> from <HI>Whichnor</HI> Chappel twixt that and the <HI>Park,</HI> which produces leaves in the <HI>Spring</HI> some years, of a brisk <HI>yellow</HI> or <HI>straw</HI> colour, which seemed to me, the leaves being less then of other thorns, and recovering their greeness (as was confest,) by St. <HI>James-tide,</HI> rather to be the effects of a <HI>disease;</HI> or the frequent cutting it for <HI>presents,</HI> then any thing else.

<P N="23">23. As for <HI>trees</HI> not noted to be of <HI>English</HI> growth by the learned Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> the <HI>Sorbus pyriformis</HI> is not the only one I met with here, which grows wild in the <HI>Moorelands</HI> at many places, and is sometimes transplanted into their gardens: it is described by <HI>L'Obelius, Mathiolus</HI> and <HI>Bauhin,</HI> who unanimously place it in <HI>France, Italy</HI> and <HI>Germany:</HI> but the first that ever found (at least noted,) it to be a <HI>Native</HI> of <HI>England</HI> that ever I heard of, was the skillfull <HI>Botanist</HI> Mr. <HI>Edmund Pitt</HI> Alderman of <HI>Worcester,</HI> who met with it in a <HI>Forrest</HI> of that <HI>County</HI> and sent this description of it to the <HI>Royal Society.</HI> It <HI>resembles</HI> (says he,) <HI>the</HI> Ornus <HI>or</HI> Quicken-tree, <HI>only the</HI> Ornus <HI>bears the</HI> flowers <HI>and</HI> fruit <HI>at the end, this on the sides of the branch: next the</HI> Sun <HI>the fruit hath a dark red blush, and is about the bigness of a small</HI> Jeneting pear; <HI>in</HI> September <HI>of so harsh an astringent tast, that it almost strangles one, but being then gather'd and kept till</HI> October <HI>it eats as well as a</HI> Medlar<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Philosoph.

<P N="25">25. In all which I fear (through the inadvertency of the Age, and his owne ill luck in not lighting upon these,) he will appear mistaken: for beside that there is no doubt that these <HI>firrs</HI> (which are 36 in number, for I told them often,) stood in the hedges and fields where they now grow, when he wrot; in all probabili∣ty they are <HI>natives</HI> of the place too; which I gather, not only from their disorderly natural situation, and excessive natural height, to which planted trees seldom arrive; but cheifly from the <HI>stooles</HI> or <HI>stumps</HI> of many trees, which I suspect to have been <HI>firrs</HI> found near them, in their natural position, in the bottoms of <HI>mosses</HI> and <HI>pooles</HI> (particularly of <HI>Shebben poole,</HI>) some of the bo∣dies whereof are daily dug up at <HI>Laynton,</HI> and in the old <HI>pewet poole</HI> in the same Parish where these now grow: so that I am apt to be∣leive, that these are only some remaines of the old naturall stock that grew here anciently, of which more hereafter.</P>
<P N="26">26. As for the <HI>accidents</HI> attending <HI>trees</HI> we find none more re∣markable than the <HI>excesses</HI> of them, and particularly in their growth, where they happen to be planted in an agreeable soil; a <HI>Specimen</HI> whereof we have in the walks befor <HI>Fisherwick</HI> house, whose front is here engraven <HI>Tab.</HI> 15. it being the seat of the right Honorable <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Viscount Massereen,</HI> Baron of <HI>Lough-Neagh,</HI> &amp;c. one of the noblest <HI>Patrons</HI> of this work: where the trees planted but few years since (I think not much above 20,) are grown to a magnitude (for so many together,) almost<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Parkinson's Theatrum Botanicum, Trib. <HI>16.</HI> Chap. <HI>96.</HI></NOTE>

Yet if we descend to single instances, I was told of two (I think,) that exceed these: one growing of an <HI>acorn</HI> set in a hedg-row between <HI>Colton</HI> and <HI>Blithefield</HI> by one <HI>Ralph Bate,</HI> which he lived to see a stout <HI>Oak</HI> bearing 2 foot square at the butt∣end, whereof the first ten foot which was sawed into <HI>boards</HI> (it being lately cut down for building,) contained near a <HI>Tun.</HI> The other was an <HI>Ash</HI> that grew in <HI>Elford</HI> Church-yard about ten years since, which though planted within the memory of man, about 80 years before, had a <HI>body</HI> 7 or 8 foot in <HI>dia∣meter,</HI> i. e. 7 or 8 yards in the girth, the <HI>timber</HI> of it being valued at <HI>thirty pound.</HI></P>
<P N="27">27. But if we step higher to trees <HI>sans</HI> date, scarce any <HI>County</HI> e're produced such <HI>Monsters</HI> as this; to which the great <HI>Oak</HI> at <HI>Norbury</HI> that grows 'twixt the <HI>Mannor</HI> and the <HI>Windmill,</HI> that is six yards in the girth; and the <HI>fair-Oake</HI> now standing in <HI>Cank∣wood,</HI> which is nine and ½; are but dwarfs in comparison: where∣of there lyes one (the <HI>trunk</HI> of an <HI>Oak</HI> cut off at the <HI>bole,</HI>) near the <HI>Lodg-House</HI> in <HI>Ellenhall</HI> park, of so vast a bulk, that my <HI>Man</HI> up∣on a horse of 15 hands high, standing on one side of it, and I also on horsback on the other, could see no part of each other: nay so far were we from it, that we judged the two tallest men in the <HI>County</HI> upon horses of 15 hands could scarce have don it. What this <HI>tree</HI> might be in <HI>girth</HI> we could not measure, the under part of it being buryed in the ground, but I judg it may be just such another <HI>Oak</HI> (only the <HI>trunk</HI> of that grew as it were <HI>triangular,</HI>) as was fell'd about 20 years since in <HI>Wrottesley</HI> park, which as the worthy Sr. <HI>Walter Wrottesley</HI> (a man far either from vanity or imposition,) seriously told me, was 15 yards in the <HI>girth,</HI> and lay so high when fell'd that two men on Horsback on each side the <HI>tree</HI> could not see one another.</P>

<PB N="212" REF="139"/>to cut off 7 yards 9 inches, which is the table in the <HI>hall</HI> at <HI>Cor∣bins-hall</HI> hard by, the ancient seat of the <HI>Corbins,</HI> of which <HI>family</HI> my worthy Friend <HI>Tho.

<P N="31">31.

Beside the <HI>excesses</HI> of the <HI>Witch-Elm</HI> and other trees in the growth of their <HI>Trunks,</HI> the <HI>excess</HI> of their force also in that growth, is not altogether unworthy our consideration; it not be∣ing the privilege of the <HI>Palm</HI> alone, <HI>crescere sub pondere:</HI> whereof we have a very eminent instance, in an old <HI>Witch-Elm</HI> growing on <HI>Powk-Hill</HI> near <HI>Bentley-Hall,</HI> that has embraced and lifted up from the ground with the growth of its root a great Stone of at least 200 weight.

<P N="33">33. Many other <HI>accidents</HI> there are beside the aforementioned that have befallen the <HI>Trunks</HI> of <HI>trees</HI> in their <HI>growth;</HI> such as that trees of different <HI>species</HI> should grow so united, as to seem to be the same, at least to grow from the same root: whereof we have a very remarkable <HI>Specimen</HI> in the <HI>broad-Lesow</HI> near <HI>Chartley,</HI> of an <HI>Oak</HI> and an <HI>Ash</HI> that thus grow together; and in Sr. <HI>Walter Bagots</HI> park there are many <HI>hollies</HI> that grow thus conjoyn∣ed at the root with <HI>Oaks.</HI> Other trees there are again that though they grow from <HI>different roots,</HI> are more strangely conjoyn∣ed some height above ground; and these both of the same, and different <HI>Species</HI>'s: such are the two <HI>Ashes</HI> in the way betwixt <HI>Gnosal</HI> and <HI>Walton-grange,</HI> which though they issue out of the ground about 8 foot asunder, yet are joyned by a <HI>cross piece</HI> pas∣sing between them about 4 foot from the ground; much after the same manner, and caused I suppose by the same means, as the <HI>Gallow-tree</HI> mentioned in the <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Oxford-shire</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Nat.

Thus there is also an <HI>Ash</HI> and an <HI>Elm</HI> near <HI>great-Sugnall,</HI> though of different <HI>species</HI>'s, and issuing from <HI>different roots,</HI> yet joyned to∣gether about a foot above ground; and at <HI>Drayton Basset,</HI> in the walk before the <HI>Manor,</HI> the seat of the right Honorable <HI>Thomas</HI> Viscount <HI>Weymouth,</HI> there grows an <HI>Oak</HI> that so intimately clasps a <HI>Thorn,</HI> that the <HI>Thorn</HI> seems to pass through it at several places. The <HI>Oak</HI> is certainly a very old tree, yet the <HI>thorn</HI> must be older, for that having the lesser body by much, it could never pass through the greater, but must rather be inclosed by it, whence we may con∣clude (though we know little of the <HI>Age</HI> of <HI>trees,</HI>) that a <HI>thorn</HI> will stand as long, if not longer then an <HI>Oak.</HI> But these are not so re∣markable as the former, because their roots not so far distant.</P>
<P N="34">34.

<P N="38">38. For which very reasons, but cheifly for the <HI>last,</HI> He would have us to believe that the <HI>trees</HI> we find here (which indeed are most like <HI>Firrs</HI>) in the <HI>mosses</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> are also nothing else but <HI>mineral trees:</HI> and the rather here in <HI>England</HI> than <HI>Holland</HI> it self, because <HI>Caesar</HI> (says He) in his <HI>Commentaries</HI> expresly tells us, that there was no <HI>firr</HI> in <HI>Britan.</HI> But by <HI>Scoockius</HI>'s favour these <HI>arguments</HI> of his, much less any of the rest alleged in the same place, are not sufficient to bring us over to his opinion: for beside that we find several of these <HI>trees</HI> with their <HI>roots</HI> joyned to them, and the <HI>stumps</HI> of their <HI>branches</HI> issuing from them; the <HI>timber</HI> of them <HI>swims</HI> in water, which <HI>lignum fossile</HI> will not doe, and is still as lyable to the <HI>Axe, Chisel, Saw,</HI> or <HI>Plane,</HI> as any <HI>wood</HI> whatever: so far are these <HI>trees</HI> found in our <HI>mosses</HI> here from being <HI>mineral substances,</HI> and so well satisfyed are we that they were once <HI>vegetables.</HI> Much less still doth the second <HI>argument</HI> drawn from <HI>Caesars Commentaries</HI> prevail upon us; for were that
<PB N="216" REF="141"/>conclusive, by a parity of reason we should have no <HI>beech</HI> in <HI>En∣gland:</HI> for in the very same place <HI>Caesar</HI> also tells us, speaking of <HI>Britan,</HI> that there was there, <HI>Materia cujusq generis, ut in Gallia, praeter abietem et fagum</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Jul.

<P N="39">39. Yet so far has this, with the present unlikelyhood that <HI>firrs</HI> were ever <HI>natives</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> prevail'd upon some; that be∣ing fully satisfyed that these <HI>subterranean trees</HI> were once <HI>vegeta∣bles,</HI> and the most likely of any sort to be the <HI>trunks</HI> of <HI>firrs;</HI> they have rather fancyed (than that ever they grew here) that they were brought hither from <HI>forraign parts</HI> by some vast <HI>deluge,</HI> and particularly that of <HI>Noah,</HI> and laine here ever since in these <HI>low mosses,</HI> whence the water went off last, when <HI>God stopped the win∣dows of heaven, and the fountains of the deep,</HI> and <HI>caused a wind to pass over the earth, that the waters were asswaged</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gen. chap. <HI>8.</HI> v. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE>. Nor seems it very impossible they should lye so long, since the plenty of <HI>bitumen</HI> wherewith these <HI>mosses</HI> abound, may well be presumed to have preserved them as well, as it has the dead carcases of the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> for thousands of years. But that which renders it un∣likely, that I say not impossible, they should be brought from forraign parts by <HI>Noah's</HI> flood is, that we should then have found them indifferently in all <HI>vales</HI> alike, in the <HI>South</HI> as well as <HI>North</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> than which nothing less: for who ever heard of them in the <HI>vales</HI> of <HI>Evesham</HI> or <HI>Aylesbury?</HI> in the vales of <HI>white</HI> or <HI>red horse?</HI> though as fit for their reception as any of the <HI>mosses</HI> afore∣mention'd.</P>
<P N="40">40. Beside such of these <HI>trees</HI> as are met with without their roots, appear either to have been <HI>burnt</HI> asunder near the ground, or are found with the <HI>marks</HI> of the <HI>Axe</HI> still remaining upon them whereby they were sever'd from their <HI>stooles,</HI> which are also found now standing in the same posture of <HI>growth</HI> as when the <HI>trees</HI> stood upon them, as may plainly be seen in <HI>Shebben pool</HI> in a dry <HI>Sum∣mer</HI> when the waters be low, where are the <HI>stumps</HI> of several, which upon examination I found to be the same wood with that of the <HI>trees</HI> found at <HI>Laynton</HI> and the old <HI>Pewit pool</HI> above men∣tion'd. And Mr <HI>Skrymsher</HI> of <HI>Aqualat</HI> also told me he had of these <HI>stooles</HI> in the <HI>black Lake</HI> near <HI>Aqualat meer</HI> in the same pos∣ture; and so they are found in the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Axholm</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Philosoph.

<P N="41"><PB N="217" REF="141"/>41. Which has driven others, who are better satisfy'd that this <HI>moss-wood</HI> (as some call it) grew not farr from where found, than they are that 'tis <HI>Firr,</HI> to think it must rather be the timber of <HI>Birches</HI> or <HI>Alders,</HI> trees that delight to grow in such moist places, which being soak't so many years in a <HI>bituminous</HI> turf, may become at length so well impregnated, as to imitate <HI>Firr</HI> both in the smell and burning; which too are more agreeable to the sizes of these <HI>subterranean trees</HI> than <HI>Firrs</HI> are, there being few of them found above a foot <HI>diameter</HI> at the butt-end, whereas <HI>Firrs</HI> sometimes grow here in <HI>England</HI> (as may be seen at <HI>Norbury</HI>) to be two yards in <HI>diameter.</HI> To which it may be answer'd, that one reason why these <HI>subterranean trees</HI> are found so small, may be, that all what we now find, is only the <HI>heart</HI> of the tree, which was much bigger before the <HI>sapp</HI> was consumed; which too may be the reason that though they are commonly found small, yet they are very long, several having been taken up in the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Axholm</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> 30 yards long; and one not many years since by <HI>Robert Brown</HI> of <HI>Haxey</HI> 36 yards in length beside the top, lying very near its root which stood as it grew, from which it was burnt asunder and not cut from it<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Philosoph Transact.

<P N="42">42. The very <HI>length</HI> of which trees seems conclusive enough (whatever may be thought of ours in <HI>Staffordshire</HI>) that they ne∣ver were the <HI>trunks</HI> of <HI>Birches</HI> or <HI>Alders:</HI> though I have an argu∣ment too perhaps altogether as cogent, that some of ours in <HI>Staffordshire</HI> must also have been <HI>Firrs</HI> as well as they, there having been one of them taken up in <HI>Peatmoore</HI> by Mr <HI>Brown</HI> of <HI>Footerley</HI> and sent to Captain <HI>Lane</HI> (who also well remembers the thing) that had its branches issuing from it in a <HI>circular</HI> form at <HI>annual</HI> distances, as all <HI>Firrs</HI> have, but <HI>birches</HI> and <HI>alders</HI> never. Not to mention again that in <HI>Staffordshire</HI> firrs yet seem to grow natu∣rally (as was shewn §. the 25 of this <HI>Chapter</HI>) not far from <HI>Laynton</HI> and the old <HI>Pewit poole,</HI> where they are found underground; which perhaps might be young trees not worth notice, when the o∣thers were cut down, and have remained since untouch't to this very day.</P>
<P N="43">43. It being plain then that these <HI>trees</HI> thus found under∣ground, are neither <HI>lignum fossile, Birches,</HI> or <HI>Alders;</HI> and that 'tis unlikely they should be left in the places they now are, by <HI>Noah's,</HI> or any other flood whatever: it remains only that we shew the most probable cause of their being thus buryed in divers parts of the <HI>Nation.</HI> Which that I may doe with all brevity and clear∣ness,
<PB N="218" REF="142"/>I must distinguish between those found near the <HI>Sea coasts,</HI> and those in the <HI>inland Countries;</HI> the former no doubt being over∣thrown and covered, either by the violent encroachments of the <HI>Sea</HI> if near the <HI>shoar,</HI> as those on the coast of <HI>Pembrok-shire</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden in Pembr.</NOTE>; and the wood that ancient writings mention was a mile and ½ to the <HI>East</HI> of <HI>Dunwich,</HI> which is now so farr in the <HI>Sea,</HI> and may possi∣bly some time or other be discover'd again in succeeding ages by some <HI>raking storm</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Mr. Ray's Observat.

Or else if further within land in a flat <HI>Country</HI> such as the <HI>fenns</HI> of <HI>Lincoln-shire,</HI> such effects may follow from the stop∣page of the mouths of <HI>Rivers</HI> (as the learned Sr. <HI>William Dug∣dale</HI> conjectures) by vast quantityes of <HI>Mudd</HI> and <HI>Sand</HI> brought into them by <HI>Tides,</HI> so that the waters recoyling and overwhelm∣ing such flat <HI>Countries,</HI> may easily so loosen the roots of the trees by overmuch moisture, that the next wind must needs overthrow them, and bury them at length in the <HI>filth</HI> which the <HI>Rivers</HI> and <HI>Sea</HI> have joyntly contributed ever since and mix'd with the stag∣nant water, to make such <HI>Fenns</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Sr. William Dugdale's Hist. of Inbanking and drayning the Fenns.

And thus I suppose the woods of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Brabant</HI> might be cover'd anciently by the choaking of the <HI>Rhine</HI> near the <HI>Arx Britannica,</HI> and so in some of the <HI>Mosses</HI> and <HI>Fenns</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="44">44. But where they are found in <HI>inland Countryes</HI> fenced from the <HI>Sea</HI> with <HI>hills;</HI> or in Mountainous parts, such as those of <HI>Iceland;</HI> the case must needs be different: whether <HI>Firrs</HI> are found alone, as 'tis commonly in <HI>Stafford-shire;</HI> or mixt with o∣ther <HI>timber,</HI> as in some parts of <HI>York-shire;</HI> whether burnt, or cut off at the <HI>Kerf,</HI> as in both places, the stumps still remaining in the same posture they grew in the firm Earth below the <HI>moores.</HI> That <HI>Firrs</HI> should be found any where alone, seems indeed some∣what odd, there being other <HI>timber</HI> enough near all the places I have yet seen, where they are so found: but if a relation be true that I met with in my travells, which as I was told had foundation too in some <HI>ancient writings</HI> in the hands of the right Honorable the Lord <HI>Visc. Gormanston</HI> first <HI>Viscount</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the case is not difficult; only admitting that these <HI>Firrs</HI> were never Natives of <HI>England,</HI> but planted here (as the story informes us) by the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Norwegians.</HI> Who when they had gotten good footing in the Land, as they had for many years; like other <HI>Conquerors</HI> endeavoured to make <HI>this</HI> as like their own <HI>Country</HI> as they could, and planted these <HI>Firrs.</HI> Which after they had grown for about 200. years, either upon the total destruction of
<PB N="219" REF="142"/>them throughout <HI>England</HI> in a day, in the time of King <HI>Ethel∣red</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Joh. Speed's Hist. of great Britan. Book <HI>7.</HI> Chap. <HI>44.</HI></NOTE>; or their final loss of all dominion here, after the death of <HI>Hardi-Canute;</HI> that no <HI>memorial</HI> whatever might remain of them, the <HI>trees</HI> they had planted were also cut down, and as many of them as grew in low moist lands (lying inconvenient for portage,) neglected, and so thus cover'd in process of time by <HI>atter∣ration;</HI> those cut down upon the hills and higher grounds (lying readyer at hand,) having been spent in divers uses, many ages agoe.</P>
<P N="45">45. For the better understanding of which new doctrine, let the <HI>Reader</HI> take notice, that the low grounds where these trees are now found, when they stood and flourish't, in all probability were tolerably dry land; for the trees whilst growing (notwith∣standing the moisture shot into the valleys then, as now,) con∣tinually spent it in their nourishment, and their as constant ex∣halations; which when cut down, there being no expence for it, the <HI>valleys</HI> at length grew into <HI>pooles;</HI> the waters whereof being thickend with perpetuall <HI>deterrations,</HI> or Earth brought from the <HI>hills</HI> and <HI>higher grounds</HI> by showers in wet, and winds in dry weather, they came at last to be <HI>Mosses</HI> or <HI>Fenns</HI> thus covering the trees as we now find them: which I take to be the first ori∣ginal of many of our <HI>Mosses,</HI> though afterwards they increase by new grass and sedg annually growing upon the rottings of the old of the former year, and so onward.</P>
<P N="46">46. Other <HI>Mosses</HI> there are too made upon the <HI>stoppage</HI> of <HI>springs</HI> by the like <HI>deterrations,</HI> or falls of Earth, and the annual rottings of the grass, sedg, &amp;c. growing upon it. Now that there are such <HI>deterrations</HI> or perpetual diminutions of all <HI>hills</HI> (except the rocky,) by every shower and wind, so that they all grow lower, and the <HI>valleys</HI> higher; we have a remarkable in∣stance (beside those above mention'd Chap. 3. § §. 11, 12,) near the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Glocester,</HI> where there was a <HI>hill</HI> that within me∣mory interposed it self to that height 'twixt it and <HI>Churcham,</HI> that People were wont to goe up into the upper roomes of <HI>Churcham</HI> Manor house to see the pinnacles of the <HI>Cathedral</HI> of <HI>Glocester;</HI> whereas after some few years they could see them on the ground: and as I was inform'd by the Reverend Dr. <HI>Gregory, Rector</HI> there, and <HI>Prebend</HI> of <HI>Glocester,</HI> whereas about 12 years since they could see out of the <HI>Church-yard</HI> at <HI>Churcham</HI> but down to the top of the <HI>upper windows</HI> of the <HI>Steeple,</HI> they can now An. 1684. plainly see the <HI>leads</HI> of the <HI>Isles</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> with most other <HI>Churches,</HI> and some <HI>houses</HI> in the <HI>Town.</HI> So great have been the <HI>deterrations</HI> from this <HI>hill</HI> in a few years, and no question are so
<PB N="220" REF="143"/>from all others, in proportion to the <HI>qualities</HI> of their respective <HI>soiles.</HI></P>
<P N="47">47. Whether the <HI>History</HI> above mention'd (it supposing <HI>firrs</HI> no natives of <HI>England,</HI>) or the method dame <HI>Nature</HI> seems to use in making <HI>Mosses</HI> and burying timber, gain belief of the <HI>Reader,</HI> shall not concern me much, for if they serve only for his <HI>diversion</HI> I am abundantly satisfyed: there being many other causes assign∣able of such <HI>wast</HI> of <HI>timber,</HI> and the <HI>sepulture</HI> of it; such as mak∣ing room for <HI>Agriculture,</HI> which was done in the inland parts of <HI>Kent</HI> no longer agoe then our <HI>Grandfathers</HI> days, where they cut it downe and made trenches by the side of each tree, and so tumbled it in, its sale not being worth the portage even there, so few years agoe<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Nat. Hist. of Oxfordsh. Chap. <HI>6. §. 56.</HI></NOTE>. So they cut and burn it down (for the greater expedition,) at this day in <HI>Muscovy</HI> for the very same reason, as I guess some of this might be, several of the trees still appearing to have been <HI>burnt,</HI> though they have lain so long in these <HI>Mos∣ses;</HI> or else if cut down for uses, <HI>warrs</HI> might come on (which were anciently very frequent,) and prevent what 'twas design'd for, either by the death of a single person, or ruin of a <HI>Family;</HI> so the timber still lying where 'twas first fell'd, might quickly be overgrown, and at length forgotten.</P>
<P N="48">48. Which how soon it will be done, and how fast these <HI>Mos∣ses</HI> grow, we have a clear evidence in a parcell of <HI>timber</HI> cut down near <HI>Bishops-Castle</HI> in the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Salop</HI> by Sr. <HI>Robert Howard</HI> in the late civil Warr, which as the Reverend and learn∣ed Mr. <HI>Obadiah Walker Master</HI> of <HI>Ʋniversity College</HI> told me, be∣ing neglected by reason of the <HI>warr,</HI> in six years time was half overgrown by such a <HI>moss</HI> where it lay: though by the way it must be noted, that such weighty bodys as <HI>timber,</HI> sink much more in proportion the first years, than ever they doe after: for it is probable from another <HI>instance,</HI> communicated by the same worthy person, that these <HI>mosses</HI> doe not rise much above an inch in a year, from a lump of <HI>Coynes</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth of <HI>England</HI> (supposed to be lost in a purse or cloth now rotted away,) taken up in such a <HI>moss</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> 18 foot deep, which being about 200 years since, whoever pleases to compute it, will find that this <HI>moss</HI> grew but about one foot in eleven years, i. e. But one inch <HI>per annum</HI> and 1/12 <HI>proxime.</HI></P>
<P N="49">49. Hitherto having consider'd trunks of trees in the whole and externally only; let us next look into them, and there we shall find perhaps as odd <HI>Phaenomena</HI> as any attending the for∣mer: witness a rotten <HI>Crab-Tree</HI> (which I shall not reckon amongst fruit trees, it growing wild,) cleft asunder by a servant of <HI>Francis</HI>

<P N="51">51. Yet more strangely than these have other <HI>Animals</HI> been found in the <HI>body</HI> of a <HI>tree</HI> somewhere near <HI>Biddulph,</HI> where two <HI>workmen</HI> sawing the <HI>body</HI> of a <HI>solid Oak,</HI> one of them at length perceived <HI>blood</HI> to follow the <HI>Saw,</HI> which though it startled them not a little, yet resolving to goe on and see the issue, when they had cut on to the end of the <HI>batt,</HI> they split it asunder, and found the <HI>Saw</HI> had past through the body of a <HI>Hardishrew</HI> or <HI>Nursrow</HI> (as they here call them,) i. e. a <HI>field-mouse,</HI> two others that lay by it, escaping away alive as soon as the <HI>tree</HI> was split, which being examin'd and found in all parts sound, the case re∣mains an inexplicable <HI>riddle</HI> to all thereabout to this very day. But me-thinks to any one that considers the superstitious <HI>Custom</HI> they have in this <HI>Country</HI> of making <HI>Nursrow-trees</HI> for the cure of unaccountable <HI>swellings</HI> in their <HI>Cattle,</HI> the thing should not seem strange. For to make any tree, whether <HI>Oak, Ash,</HI> or <HI>Elm</HI> (it being in∣different which) a <HI>Nursrow-tree,</HI> they catch one or more of these <HI>mice</HI> (which they fancy bite their <HI>Cattle,</HI> and make them swell,) and having bored a hole to the <HI>center</HI> in the <HI>body</HI> of the <HI>tree,</HI> they put the <HI>mice</HI> in, and then drive a <HI>pegg</HI> in after them of the same <HI>wood,</HI> where they starving at last, communicat forsooth such a <HI>virtue</HI> to the <HI>tree,</HI> that <HI>Cattle</HI> thus swoln being whipt with the boughs of it, presently recover: of which <HI>trees</HI> they have not so many neither (though so easily made, but that at some <HI>places</HI> they goe 8 or 10 miles to procure this remedy.</P>
<P N="52">52. Now though it may be improbable enough that the <HI>swel∣lings</HI> of their <HI>Cattle</HI> arises from the <HI>bites</HI> of these <HI>mice,</HI> but rather from the <HI>Sting</HI> of the <HI>Buprestis</HI> or <HI>Burst-cow;</HI> the <HI>Pityocampe</HI> of <HI>Dioscorides</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Dioscorid. de Material.

<PB N="223" REF="147"/>imagin, that some person not farr distant might according to the superstitious <HI>custom</HI> of the <HI>Country</HI> make this <HI>Oak</HI> (unknown either to the <HI>owner</HI> or <HI>workmen</HI>) a <HI>Nursrow-tree</HI> but a little before it came to be cut down and sawn asunder, by <HI>pegging</HI> in these <HI>mice:</HI> Just as the <HI>Irish</HI> serve the <HI>Connough worm</HI> (a sort of <HI>Catterpiller</HI>) which they think <HI>poysons</HI> their <HI>Cattle,</HI> though it have no poyson in't, which they shut up in a hole thus bored in a tree, where when the <HI>worm</HI> is dead, the <HI>bark</HI> &amp; <HI>leaves</HI> of that <HI>tree</HI> bruised and steeped in water, and given to the <HI>Cattle</HI> they apprehend thus poysoned, ever af∣ter gives them an infallible <HI>cure</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Philosoph. Transact. Numb. <HI>168.</HI></NOTE>. To which let me add the <HI>su∣perstitious veneration</HI> that some People give in this <HI>Country,</HI> espe∣cially in the <HI>Moorelands</HI> amongst the ancienter sort, and some∣times those of pretty good fashion too, to the <HI>Fraxinus sylvestris</HI> or <HI>Quicken-tree,</HI> which they firmly believe will certainly preserve them from all <HI>fascinations,</HI> and <HI>evill spirits;</HI> upon which account many are very carefull to have a <HI>walking staff</HI> of it, and will stick the boughs of it about their <HI>bedds.</HI> But of these <HI>trifles,</HI> I fear, more than enough.</P>
<P N="53">53. Which is all concerning <HI>whole trees</HI> and their <HI>trunks,</HI> but that in generall the <HI>timber</HI> of this <HI>Country</HI> (though much of it has been destroyed of late years) is as <HI>large</HI> and <HI>good</HI> perhaps as in any part of <HI>England;</HI> witness the very great quantity of very good <HI>timber</HI> in the <HI>park</HI> of the right Worshipfull Sr. <HI>Walter Bagot,</HI> amongst which the <HI>Queche-Oaks</HI> are very remarkable: But the <HI>timber</HI> that surpasses all in the <HI>County,</HI> both for quantity, great∣ness, and goodness, is that in the <HI>park</HI> at <HI>Madeley-Manor,</HI> the seat of that courteous and generous Gentleman <HI>John Offley</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which in memory of his many and signal favours, is here engraven <HI>Tab.</HI> 16. where in the first place, there is so much, that as it has been computed by indifferent judges, the whole has been thought worth 20000 pounds sterling; out of which might be cul∣led 1000 trees, worth 8000 pounds; and out of these again 100, that scarce would be sold for 1500 pounds; Not to mention the great quantities of excellent <HI>timber,</HI> to be seen in many other <HI>parks</HI> all over the <HI>County.</HI></P>
<P N="54">54. Beside the unusual accidents of whole <HI>trees</HI> and their <HI>trunks,</HI> there are some also which have happen'd to their <HI>bran∣ches, fruits,</HI> and <HI>leaves;</HI> amongst which I cannot but reckon a great parcell of <HI>Matrices</HI> or <HI>Insect-husks</HI> of the <HI>purple-Kermes</HI> kind, adhering not only to the underside as usually, but set quite round a branch of <HI>Thorn,</HI> found (and given me by the Worship∣full Capt. <HI>Tho. Lane</HI> of <HI>Bentley</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>) at great <HI>Sarden:</HI> which are not the <HI>excrescencies,</HI> much less the <HI>fruit</HI> or <HI>berries</HI> of any
<PB N="224" REF="148"/>tree, as the <HI>Scarlet-Kermes</HI> has been too long beleived to be of the <HI>Ilex,</HI> but artificial things contiguous to the plants, made there by <HI>Insects</HI> to preserve their <HI>Eggs</HI> and nourish their <HI>young,</HI> as has been clearly demonstrated by the learned Dr. <HI>Lister</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philosoph. Transact. Num.</HI> 71, 72, 73.</NOTE>, a man wonder∣fully happy both in natural discoveries, and imposing suitable names, as he has done to these of <HI>Patellae Kermi-formes,</HI> from their form, and manner of sticking to the <HI>branches</HI> of many sorts of <HI>Vegetables,</HI> just as <HI>patellae</HI> do to <HI>rocks;</HI> and their giving a <HI>purple</HI> or <HI>murrey</HI> tincture; which they performe best when the <HI>Insect</HI> is <HI>in vermiculo:</HI> for when the <HI>Insect</HI> comes to maturity, the <HI>Husk</HI> grows dry, and the dye seems to be spent, as it was in these of <HI>Sarden</HI> before I had them, so that I could neither tell what <HI>colour</HI> they yeilded, nor what <HI>Insect</HI> they might be made by; if by the <HI>bee-kind,</HI> it must be a wonderfull small one. the <HI>patellae</HI> of ours being much smaller, than any of those described by Dr. <HI>Lister.</HI></P>
<P N="55">55. Yet the same Dr. <HI>Lister</HI> as fortunate as he has been in the above mention'd discovery; as himself confesses, could never di∣scern (whatever diligence he used) any <HI>Eggs</HI> in the center of that <HI>by-fruit</HI> that grows on the leaves of the <HI>Oak,</HI> which we call <HI>Galls,</HI> or <HI>Oak-balls;</HI> but a <HI>worm</HI> constantly, even at their very first appearance<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Philosoph. Transact. Num. <HI>75.</HI></NOTE>; not doubting however but that diligence would some time or other discover the <HI>Eggs</HI> themselves: which was in∣deed happily done An. 1680 by that curious Observer <HI>Walter Chetwynd</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> now <HI>high-Sherriff</HI> of the <HI>County</HI> and his ingeni∣ous Chaplain Mr. <HI>Charles King</HI> Student of <HI>Ch.

<P N="56">56. As the <HI>accidents</HI> attending the leaves of <HI>herbs</HI> and <HI>shrubbs,</HI> were cheifly in their variation from the ordinary colour, so it is in <HI>trees;</HI> and I suppose may be met with, one where or other, in almost all kinds of them. Near <HI>Hammerwich</HI> in the high-way growing over a pond, I found a <HI>Holly-shrub</HI> bearing leaves prettily edg'd with yellow; and was told of others near <HI>little-Aston</HI> stri∣ped

Nor doe these <HI>stripings</HI> only affect the <HI>inferior</HI> sorts of <HI>trees,</HI> but <HI>timber trees</HI> also, as may be seen in a large <HI>Ash</HI> that grows in the hedg row (by the high-way side) of the same close where the great <HI>witch-Elm</HI> abovemention'd formerly grew, near <HI>Field-hall,</HI> whose <HI>leaves</HI> are some of them all <HI>white,</HI> (whence it enjoyes the name of the <HI>white-Ash</HI>) others striped both <HI>white</HI> and <HI>green.</HI> And in the <HI>Park</HI> of the right Worshipfull Sr. <HI>Walter Bagot</HI> Baronet, one of the noblest <HI>promoters</HI> of this <HI>designe,</HI> whose ancient and well situat house at <HI>Blithefield</HI> is here annext <HI>Tab.</HI> 17. there growes an <HI>Oak</HI> near the <HI>Hill-stile</HI> with just such leaves as his <HI>Ash</HI> at <HI>Field,</HI> part of them all <HI>white,</HI> and part <HI>white</HI> and <HI>green:</HI> which how it comes to pass that plants thus vary in the <HI>colours</HI> of their <HI>leaves,</HI> has been so often taught already that it would be nauseous to repeat it, therefore no more of it here<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Nat.

<P N="57">57. After the <HI>Timber,</HI> I proceed next to the <HI>Fruit-trees</HI> of this <HI>County</HI> that have any thing extraordinary either in their <HI>growth, flowers,</HI> or <HI>fruit;</HI> for the first whereof, there is an <HI>appletree</HI> with∣in the moat of the <HI>Parsonage</HI> house at <HI>Leigh,</HI> that spreads from boughs end to boughs end 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or 18 yards, in circumference supposing them to spread uniformly, 54 yards; shading in dry weather, and dropping in wet, upon 244 square yards of ground; under which, allowing 3 square yards for a <HI>horse</HI> to stand on (3 yards long, and one broad, seeming a competent proportion) and 4 square feet for a <HI>Man;</HI> above <HI>eighty</HI> Horsemen, or 549 Foot∣men may be sheltered from the injuries either of <HI>Sun</HI> or <HI>rain:</HI> a vast number for an <HI>Appletree;</HI> yet the quantity of <HI>fruit</HI> it some∣times bears, seems equally to demonstrate the excess of its great∣ness, it having born some years no less then 50 strike of <HI>apples.</HI> To which let me add the odd growth of an old <HI>pear-tree</HI> in that part of <HI>Warton</HI> which is in the Parish of <HI>Forton</HI> in the Hortyard of <HI>Edward Low</HI> of that <HI>village,</HI> which though fallen flat on the ground, has 6 or 7 young trees sprung perpendicularly out of the body of it, in right angles, as it lyes <HI>in plano Horizontis;</HI> each, one with another a foot in <HI>diameter,</HI> and most of them 40 foot high.</P>
<P N="58">58. As for <HI>trees</HI> that have any thing remarkable in their <HI>flowering,</HI> the <HI>Peartree</HI> at <HI>Colmoore</HI> at the house of the heirs of Mr. <HI>Thomas Hawe,</HI> seems to be very extraordinary, which (like <HI>Gla∣stonbury thorn</HI>) though in frost and snow, puts forth <HI>blossoms</HI> at <HI>Christmass:</HI> and soe does a peartree in the gardens belonging to
<PB N="226" REF="151"/>the <HI>Castle</HI> here at <HI>Oxford:</HI> now what should occasion the early <HI>flowering</HI> of this <HI>tree,</HI> so long before other <HI>trees</HI> of its kind, is hard to determine, this overforwardness seeming rather to argue an <HI>excess</HI> of <HI>vigor,</HI> than an effect of <HI>weakness;</HI> though it be worthy notice that all <HI>striped trees,</HI> which are sick and diseased, doe put forth their <HI>leaves</HI> and <HI>blossoms</HI> sooner, than others of their kind: but should we rather grant it to be an <HI>excess</HI> of <HI>strength,</HI> it may nevertheless (as all <HI>extremes</HI> are) be a <HI>vice</HI> in the <HI>tree,</HI> it being commonly found in many other trees, that are over early and luxuriant in their production of <HI>flowers,</HI> that they bear little <HI>fruit,</HI> as I have ground to suspect neither of these doe.</P>
<P N="59">59. Quite contrary to a <HI>peartree</HI> I saw at one <HI>Jane Arnolds</HI> at <HI>Hamstall Ridware,</HI> that <HI>blossoms</HI> and also <HI>bears</HI> twice in a <HI>year;</HI> When I saw it in <HI>June</HI> An. 1680. it had large <HI>pears</HI> on it, and the <HI>blossoms</HI> at the same time for the second <HI>Crop,</HI> which they told me would not be ripe till about <HI>Michaelmass,</HI> and thus it does every year, like those mentioned in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Nat. Hist. of Oxfordshire Chap. <HI>6.</HI> §. <HI>86.</HI></NOTE>: which how it should come to pass, I can no way divine, unless it should a∣rise from a strange unaccountable <HI>mixture</HI> which may sometimes happen betwixt the woods of the <HI>graft</HI> and the <HI>stock;</HI> when either an <HI>early</HI> fruit is grafted upon a <HI>late</HI> stock; or a <HI>late</HI> fruit upon an <HI>early</HI> stock; the woods whereof growing up joyntly to∣gether, yet so as not to mix <HI>Sapvessells,</HI> may both produce <HI>fruit</HI> in their respective <HI>seasons:</HI> as I have seen the same tree doe <HI>Oran∣ges,</HI> and <HI>Limmons</HI> together, and not only upon the same <HI>branch,</HI> but in the same <HI>individual fruit,</HI> part of it being an <HI>Orange</HI> and part a <HI>Limmon:</HI> wherein I am the more confirm'd, the first and second crop of such <HI>trees</HI> as these, seeming most commonly of dif∣ferent <HI>species</HI>'s, at least are of quite different sizes, the last Crop being always less than the first.</P>
<P N="60">60. And this had been all concerning <HI>fruit-trees,</HI> but that I think it worthy notice that all sorts of <HI>fruits</HI> both in <HI>Hortyards</HI> and <HI>Gardens</HI> are cultivated here of late years, much more than anciently they were, and at some places to that height, that they seem to endeavour to equal the best planted <HI>Counties.</HI> For <HI>Ap∣ples</HI> I shall instance in the parish of <HI>Arley,</HI> where all the grounds and hedges are planted, much after the manner of <HI>Worcester-shire</HI> (into which indeed it runs with a long nook) there being scarce a <HI>Cottage</HI> that has not some proportionable plantation belonging to it, having all sorts of <HI>Pippins</HI> of the best, and so of other fruit; the <HI>Red-streak</HI> indeed thrives not over well with them, but the <HI>Jennet Moyle</HI> exceedingly, insomuch that 'tis thought that were not their fruit sold abroad, they could make in this <HI>parish</HI> at lest 200

Which have been so nicely inquired into, by the learned and indefatigable Mr. <HI>Willughby</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> that I have met with but two that I can safely say are wholy <HI>undescribed;</HI> which are 1. a sort of <HI>Swan</HI> they have upon the <HI>Trent</HI> near <HI>Rugeley,</HI> whose leggs are never <HI>black,</HI> or rather of that <HI>leaden colour</HI> which other <HI>Swans</HI> are; but of a <HI>blushy red</HI> like those of a tame <HI>Goose,</HI> whence I think I may take the boldness to give it the <HI>Epithet</HI> of <HI>Cygnus Anseroides.</HI> These at first indeed I thought might be <HI>Hoopers</HI> or <HI>wild-Swans</HI> whose feet are not <HI>black,</HI> but of a dusky yel∣low; but when I understood that they were as <HI>large</HI> and <HI>white</HI> as the tame <HI>Swan,</HI> which the <HI>wild-Swan</HI> is not; and as the in∣genious Mr. <HI>Chetwynd</HI> of <HI>Rugeley</HI> told me, that the <HI>Cygnets</HI> of
<PB N="229" REF="154"/>some of these were as <HI>white</HI> as the <HI>old</HI> ones; I could not then but conclude, but it must be a different kind from any yet described in any <HI>Author</HI> I can find. To which perhaps I might add a∣nother <HI>whole-footed water fowle</HI> that they have about <HI>Amerton,</HI> which they call <HI>French geese,</HI> and no question they are of the <HI>Goose</HI> kind, differing in nothing from the common, but in the <HI>bill</HI> which is <HI>black,</HI> and in the noise it makes, which is like that of a <HI>Bittern:</HI> But in all probability it is the <HI>Anser Cygnoides Guineen∣sis</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Willughby's Ornithology.

<P N="3">3. Much more sure am I that a <HI>cloven-footed water-fowle,</HI> a sort of <HI>Loone</HI> or <HI>Doucker</HI> shewn me by my worthy Friend <HI>Francis Wolfer∣stan</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in his Parlour at <HI>Statfold,</HI> but killd at <HI>Combeford,</HI> is an <HI>undescribed bird:</HI> for though it agree with other <HI>Loons,</HI> in having a narrow straight sharp-pointed <HI>bill,</HI> no <HI>tail,</HI> small short <HI>wings</HI> disproportionable to the body, and the <HI>leggs</HI> set on so near the rump, and so far from the <HI>center</HI> of gravity in the bird, that it can neither fly, nor conveniently walk; but seems wholy con∣trived for quick swiming and easy diving; which is also further evident from its broad <HI>flat</HI> leggs and <HI>finned</HI> toes, which though not webb'd together, yet have lateral <HI>membrans</HI> all along both sides of them, and broad <HI>claws</HI> like <HI>human</HI> nails: though I say in all these it agree with the <HI>cloven-footed, fin-toed Douckers</HI> that want <HI>tailes</HI> (for there are some that have them) yet it differs in the head from all others I ever saw, or could meet in the <HI>books;</HI> it not be∣ing only <HI>crested,</HI> and <HI>horned,</HI> with two long tuffts of feathers, set on about the crown of the head; but adorned also underneath the <HI>throat</HI> with two as remarkable <HI>tuffts</HI> hanging down like an old fashion'd divided beard as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 22 <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. whence it may justly claim the name of <HI>Colymbus cristatus cornutus barbatus,</HI> it being quite different, if we may beleive the <HI>Cut,</HI> from the <HI>crested Loon</HI> of <HI>Aldrovand</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ulyss.

<P N="5">5. Of unusual <HI>small birds</HI> here are also several, both of the soft and slender, and the short hard beak'd kinds; such as the <HI>Hirundo apus</HI> or <HI>black Martin,</HI> here call'd the <HI>Martlet,</HI> which I beleive indeed is the <HI>bird</HI> intended by that name in <HI>Heraldry,</HI> and not the <HI>Hirundo agrestis sive rustica Plinii,</HI> it having so very <HI>long</HI> wings, and so <HI>short</HI> leggs and <HI>small</HI> feet, that it cannot easily rise from the ground unless it be very plain, and free from <HI>grass;</HI> wherefore it either always flyes, or sits upon the tops of <HI>Churches, Towers,</HI> or else hangs on other <HI>ancient buildings</HI> by its sharp claws, from which it falls and so takes flight: of these I saw at <HI>Share shall,</HI> near <HI>Hilton,</HI> and <HI>Beaudesart;</HI> where too in a <HI>Quarry</HI> near the house, I saw the <HI>Hirundo riparia</HI> or ground <HI>Martin,</HI> of a dark-dun or Mouse-colour, which is the least of all the <HI>Swallow</HI> kind, and makes holes into the sides of <HI>banks</HI> and <HI>cliffs</HI> about a yard forward in <HI>plano Horizontis,</HI> where it builds its nest.

<P N="6">6. And of unusual birds frequenting the water, here are also
<PB N="231" REF="155"/>divers kinds, some of them <HI>cloven footed</HI> and <HI>piscivorous,</HI> though they build their nests on the tops of trees; as the <HI>Ardea cinerea</HI> or common <HI>Heron</HI> or <HI>Heronshaw,</HI> whereof I saw divers siting on the tops of the highest trees in <HI>Norbury</HI> park. <HI>Bellonius</HI> indeed denyes that they breed in <HI>England,</HI> but there are many other instances whereby he may be confuted beside this, in divers parts of the <HI>Nation,</HI> though this I think is the best in this <HI>County.</HI> The <HI>Colymbus major</HI> the great <HI>Loon</HI> or <HI>Arsfoot</HI> is also found in this <HI>County,</HI> whereof I had one given me by the Honorable Lady <HI>Jane Leveson Gower,</HI> kill'd somewhere near <HI>Trentham,</HI> in all parts cor∣responding with the <HI>cloven-footed fin-toed Loones</HI> without tailes, described as above §. 3. of this <HI>Chapter.</HI> Of <HI>whole footed water fowle</HI> the <HI>Avosetta Italorum</HI> or <HI>Recurvirostra,</HI> is also found here, as well as in the Eastern parts of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> there ha∣ving been of them <HI>kill'd</HI> at the black-<HI>Lakes</HI> near <HI>Aqualat, eight</HI> of them being seen first in the morning, and but <HI>six</HI> at night when they shot; which needs no other description, but that its bill is <HI>reflext</HI> upward, which is peculiar to this bird, ending in a thin slender weak point, somewhat of the consistence and strength of a <HI>Whale-bone</HI> of the same size.</P>
<P N="7">7. But the strangest <HI>whole-footed water fowle</HI> that frequents this <HI>County</HI> is the <HI>Larus cinereus Ornithologi,</HI> the <HI>Larus cinereus ter∣tius Aldrovandi,</HI> and the <HI>Cepphus</HI> of <HI>Gesner</HI> and <HI>Turner</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Cour. Gesneri de Avibus Lib. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE>; in some <HI>Counties</HI> call'd the <HI>black-Cap,</HI> in others the <HI>Sea</HI> or <HI>Mire-Crow,</HI> here the <HI>Pewit;</HI> which being of the <HI>migratory</HI> kind, come annually to certain <HI>pooles</HI> in the Estate of the right Worshipfull Sr. <HI>Charles Skrymsher</HI> Knight to build and breed, and to no other Estate in, or neer the <HI>County,</HI> but of this <HI>Family,</HI> to which they have belong'd <HI>ultra hominum memoriam,</HI> and never moved from it, though they have changed their <HI>station</HI> often. They anciently came to the old <HI>Pewit poole</HI> above mentiond<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid. supra Chap. <HI>6.</HI> §. <HI>36.40.42.</HI></NOTE>, about ½ amile S. W. of <HI>Nor∣bury</HI> Church, but it being their <HI>strange quality</HI> (as the whole <HI>Fa∣mily</HI> will tell you, to whom I referr the <HI>Reader</HI> for the following <HI>relation</HI>) to be disturb'd and remove upon the <HI>death</HI> of the <HI>head</HI> of it, as they did within memory, upon the death of <HI>James Skrym∣sher</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to <HI>Offley-Moss</HI> near <HI>Woods-Eves,</HI> which <HI>Moss</HI> though containing two <HI>Gentlemans</HI> land, yet (which is very remarkable) the <HI>Pewits</HI> did discern betwixt the one and the other, and build only on the <HI>Land</HI> of the next heir <HI>John Skrymsher</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> so wholy are they addicted to this <HI>family.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. At which <HI>Moss</HI> they continued about three years, and then removed to the <HI>old pewit poole</HI> again, where they continued to the
<PB N="232" REF="156"/>death of the said <HI>John Skrymsher</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which happening on the <HI>Eve</HI> to our <HI>Lady-day,</HI> the very time when they are laying their <HI>Eggs,</HI> yet so concern'd were they at this <HI>Gentlemans</HI> death, that not∣withstanding this tye of the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> which has ever been held to be universal and perpetual, they left their <HI>nest</HI> and <HI>Eggs;</HI> and though they made some attempts of laying again at <HI>Offley-Moss,</HI> yet they were still so disturb'd that they bred not at all that year. The next year after they went to <HI>Aqualat,</HI> to another <HI>Gentlemans</HI> Estate of the same family (where though tempted to stay with all the care imaginable) yet continued there but two years, and then returned again to another <HI>poole</HI> of the next heir of <HI>John Skrymsher</HI> deceased, call'd <HI>Shebben poole</HI> in the parish of <HI>high Offley</HI> where they continue to this day, and seem to be the propriety, as I may say (though a wild-fowle) of the right Wor∣shipfull Sr. <HI>Charles Skrymsher</HI> Knight, their present Lord and master.</P>
<P N="9">9. But being of the <HI>migratory</HI> kind, their first appearance is not till about the latter end of <HI>February,</HI> and then in number scarce above six, which come as it were as <HI>harbingers</HI> to the rest, to see whether the <HI>Hafts</HI> or <HI>Islands</HI> in the pooles (upon which they build their neasts) be prepared for them; but these never so much as lighten, but fly over the <HI>poole</HI> scarce staying an hour: about the sixth of <HI>March</HI> following, there comes a pretty considerable flight, of a hundred or more, and then they alight on the <HI>hafts,</HI> and stay all day, but are gon again at night. About our <HI>Lady-Day,</HI> or sooner in a forward <HI>Spring,</HI> they come to stay for good, otherwise not till the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> when they build their <HI>nests,</HI> which they make not of sticks, but heath and rushes, making them but shal∣low, and laying generally but 4 eggs, 3 and 5 more rarely, which are about the bignes of a small Hen-egg. The <HI>Hafts</HI> or <HI>Islands</HI> are prepared for them between <HI>Michaelmass</HI> and <HI>Christmass,</HI> by cutting down the <HI>reeds</HI> and <HI>rushes,</HI> and putting them aside in the nooks and corners of the <HI>hafts,</HI> and in the valleys to make them level; for should they be permitted to rot on the <HI>Islands,</HI> the <HI>Pe∣wits</HI> would not endure them.</P>
<P N="10">10. After three weeks sitting the young ones are harch't, and a∣bout a month after are almost ready to flye, which usually happens on the third of <HI>June,</HI> when the <HI>Proprietor</HI> of the <HI>poole</HI> orders them to be driven and catch'd, the <HI>Gentry</HI> comeing in from all parts to see the sport; the manner thus. They pitch a <HI>Rabbit-net</HI> on the bank side, in the most convenient place over against the <HI>hafts,</HI> the <HI>Net</HI> in the middle being about ten yards from the side, but close at the ends in the manner of a <HI>bow;</HI> then six or seven Men wade into the <HI>poole</HI> beyond the <HI>Pewits,</HI> over
<PB REF="156"/>
<PB REF="157"/>
<PB REF="157"/>
<PB REF="158"/>
<PB N="233" REF="158"/>against the <HI>Net,</HI> with long staves, and drive them from the <HI>hafts,</HI> whence they all swim to the bank side, and landing run like <HI>Lap∣wings</HI> into the <HI>Net,</HI> where people standing ready, take them up, and put them into two <HI>penns</HI> made within the <HI>bow</HI> of the <HI>Net,</HI> which are built round, about 3 yards <HI>Diameter,</HI> and a yard high or somwhat better, with small stakes driven into the ground in a circle, and interwoven with broom and other raddles, as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 19. at the bottom whereof is represented in <HI>Sculpture,</HI> the poole, and whole method of taking these <HI>Pewits;</HI> and <HI>Norbury Manor</HI> at the top, the seat of the <HI>Proprietor,</HI> a most generous <HI>En∣courager</HI> of this work.</P>
<P N="11">11. In which manner there have been taken of them in one morning 50 dosens at a driving, which at 5<SUP>s</SUP> <HI>per</HI> dosen (the ancient price of them) comes to twelve pounds ten shillings: but at several <HI>drifts</HI> that have been anciently made in the same morn∣ing, there have been as many taken as have been sold for thirty pounds, so that some years the profit of them ha's amounted to fifty or threescore pounds, beside what the generous <HI>Proprietor</HI> usually presents his <HI>Relations,</HI> and the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry</HI> of the <HI>County</HI> withall, which he constantly does in a plentifull manner, sending them to their houses in <HI>Crates</HI> alive, so that feeding them with <HI>livers,</HI> &amp; other <HI>entrals</HI> of beasts, they may kill them at what di∣stance of time they please, according as occasions present themsel∣selves, they being accounted a good dish at the most plenti∣full <HI>Tables.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. But they commonly appoint 3 days of driving them, with∣in fourteen days or thereabout, of the second or third of <HI>June;</HI> which while they are doing, some have observed a certain old one that seems to be somewhat more concern'd than the rest, be∣ing clamorous, and striking down upon the very heads of the <HI>Men;</HI> which has given ground of suspicion that they have some <HI>Government</HI> amongst them, and that this is their <HI>Prince,</HI> that is so much concern'd for its <HI>Subjects.</HI> And 'tis further observed that when there is great plenty of them, the <HI>Lent-Corn</HI> of the <HI>Country</HI> is so much the better, and so the <HI>Cow-pastures</HI> too, by reason they pick up all the <HI>worms,</HI> and the <HI>Fern-flyes,</HI> which though bred in the <HI>Fern,</HI> yet nip and feed on the young corn and grass, and hinder their growth.</P>
<P N="13">13. Other birds there are here that are more commonly seen, and doe not only breed, but remain constantly in the <HI>Country,</HI> and are therefore call'd <HI>perennial;</HI> which yet many of them have had something extraordinary either in their <HI>colours, limbs, eggs</HI> or <HI>time</HI> of <HI>production,</HI> that has render'd them remarkable. At <HI>hill-Rid∣ware</HI> I was told of a white <HI>Poppinjay;</HI> and at <HI>Apedale</HI> near the
<PB N="234" REF="159"/>house of one <HI>John Middleton,</HI> for three or four years together, there were white <HI>Crows</HI> hatch't in the same neast with <HI>black</HI> ones, whereof some they sold as rarities for <HI>half crownes</HI> a piece: which in all probability must come to pass, by a <HI>hen-crow</HI> of an ordinary colour, being trod by a <HI>cock</HI> of the <HI>Royston-breed,</HI> or from <HI>Norway,</HI> or <HI>Greenland</HI> where they are commonly white, or <HI>vice versa;</HI> as we see it often falls out in <HI>doggs</HI> and other <HI>Animals.</HI> Which is further confirm'd to me by a white <HI>Sparrow</HI> kill'd at <HI>Aldrich,</HI> which built about Mr. <HI>Jourdans</HI> house there, and produced young ones, some white, some gray, and others speckled with white and the usual colour, of other <HI>Sparrows.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. And in their <HI>beaks</HI> and <HI>leggs,</HI> I met with so many <HI>defor∣mities,</HI> and unusual <HI>excesses,</HI> that it would be endless to recount them: the cheif are these. In the <HI>Hall</HI> at <HI>Bentley</HI> there is a <HI>Ra∣vens</HI> head whose <HI>bill</HI> is crook't both ways, the <HI>Mandibles</HI> crossing one another, like those of the <HI>Shell-Apple</HI> or <HI>Cross-bill,</HI> the lower chap turning upwards, and the upper downwards. And in the <HI>Coffee-house</HI> at <HI>Lichfield,</HI> I was shown another <HI>Ravens</HI> head, whose upper <HI>mandible</HI> turned downward, and crossed the lower; but the under one straight, only much longer than the upper as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 22. <HI>Fig.</HI> 2. At great <HI>Bridgford</HI> there was a <HI>Pidgeon</HI> pro∣duced with two heads; and there was a <HI>Pewit</HI> catch't at <HI>Nor∣bury</HI> with 4 leggs. Not to mention a <HI>Goose,</HI> I was told, was hatch't at <HI>Shelfield</HI> with three leggs, the third issuing from about the rump, and hanging loose, being of no use to the <HI>Animal,</HI> as indeed few of these <HI>excesses</HI> of <HI>nature</HI> are: which perhaps may arise, as <HI>Fabricius</HI> thinks, either from <HI>Ova Gemellifica,</HI> that is, <HI>Eggs</HI> with two <HI>Yolks,</HI> two <HI>Whites,</HI> two <HI>Chalazae</HI> or <HI>treddles,</HI> two <HI>Cicatriculae</HI> &amp;c. i. e. that have every thing double<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hieron.

<P N="15">15. Which brings me next to consider the <HI>Eggs</HI> of <HI>birds,</HI> and their time of <HI>hatching,</HI> wherein I also met with divers <HI>Anomalies</HI> of <HI>Nature:</HI> the ingenious Mr. <HI>Miller</HI> vicar of <HI>Wednesbury</HI> amongst his <HI>tithe-Eggs,</HI> met with one whose <HI>Yolk</HI> was as perfectly <HI>white,</HI> as that we usually call soe, the separation betwixt them remaining as distict as in ordinary <HI>Eggs</HI> i. e. He met with an <HI>Egg</HI> with two <HI>whites</HI> including one another, such as <HI>Aristotle</HI> calles imperfect, improlific <HI>Eggs,</HI> which will never produce <HI>Chicken,</HI> and <HI>Hierony∣mus Fabricius, Ova centenina</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hieron. Fabr. ab Aquapend. de format. Ovi &amp; pulli. p. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE>; they being a sort of <HI>Eggs</HI> (as he
<PB N="235" REF="159"/>would have us beleive) which hens lay at last, after they have ex∣cluded a hundred before; or the last they lay, after they have made an end of laying for that year; which whether true, or no, depends upon the credit of the <HI>Author:</HI> But that such <HI>Eggs</HI> as these (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> says) must be imperfect and barren, is certain enough; the <HI>Yolk</HI> in an <HI>Egg</HI> being equally necessary for the pro∣duction and maintenance of a <HI>chick</HI> as the <HI>white, &amp; vice versa</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Gul.

<P N="16">16. As to the frequency of <HI>Hen's</HI> laying their <HI>Eggs,</HI> Dr <HI>Harvey</HI> tells us that some there be in <HI>England</HI> that will lay an <HI>Egg</HI> every day, yet that these are not the most <HI>fruitfull;</HI> which for the most part lay an <HI>Egg</HI> for two days together (in the morning of the first day, and toward evening the second) and rest the third<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Gul.

Broughton</HI> of <HI>Broughton</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> there was a Hen then belonging to <HI>Ann Biddulph</HI> of <HI>Edgiall,</HI> when I was travelling this <HI>County,</HI> that would ordinarily lay 3 Eggs in a natural day, or 24 hours; and that the same thing in a manner had been found in <HI>Ducks,</HI> at Mr. <HI>Noble's</HI> of <HI>Charley,</HI> where eight <HI>Duckes</HI> being shut up all night; sometimes layd 9, sometimes 10, and once no less than 12 Eggs in a night; which was look't on by the <HI>good-housewives</HI> as very extraordinary: and yet little less than this we find was observ'd as long agoe as <HI>Aristotle,</HI> who not only tells that the <HI>Hadrianic hens</HI> lay'd every day, but that there were some <HI>tame Hens</HI> lay'd twice <HI>per diem;</HI> but then that the former or∣dinarily broke their Eggs, and so destroy'd their young; and the latter themselves, by their over much fruitfullness<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Aristot. de Hist.

The time of <HI>hatching</HI> their Eggs, by some sort of fowle, has also been noted here in some places, to be very extraordinary: Thus the worthy Mr. <HI>Chetwynd</HI> in his park at <HI>Ingestre</HI> observed young <HI>Ravens</HI> to goe to bough on <HI>Newyears day,</HI> which therefore must be hatch't in the winter near <HI>Christmass;</HI> as some also were in <HI>Ashmers Park</HI> near <HI>Wolverhampton,</HI> An. 1665, by a <HI>Raven</HI> that con∣stantly built there for many years.

<P N="18">18.

<P N="21">21. Amongst the <HI>winged Insects</HI> it is also worth notice, that at <HI>Throwley,</HI> the Seat of the right Honorable the <HI>Countess</HI> of <HI>Ardglass,</HI> I was shewn by the most ingenious <HI>Charles Cotton</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the <HI>forficula</HI> or Ear-wigg of a milk <HI>white</HI> colour, which are ordinarily of a <HI>Ches∣nut.</HI> And it is very considerable that another curious <HI>Observer</HI> of this <HI>County,</HI> opening a small flye <HI>de genere</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>sive vaginipen∣nium,</HI>
<PB N="238" REF="161"/>by the help of a <HI>Microscope,</HI> saw two living <HI>Insects</HI> come out from within it, both alive, exactly alike, and very nimble, which in this state most resembled <HI>Cheese-mites</HI> of any thing he knew; only they were somthing bigger and had longer <HI>hornes,</HI> but wanted <HI>bristles</HI> and were of a reddish colour, which by a strong refle∣ction of light from their backs, and the variety of colours caused thereby, he could perceive they were of the <HI>crusty</HI> or <HI>sheath-winged</HI> kind, which yet had been observed before by the learned <HI>Dr. Lis∣ter,</HI> tho' not publish't till in <HI>June</HI> 84<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Philoph.

<P N="22">22. The same worthy person opening another <HI>Insect</HI> next dore to flying (it being called a <HI>flea,</HI> as some would have it, <HI>a verbo</HI> to flye, <HI>quia adeo celeriter saltat, ut volare videatur</HI>) found in those of them of a reddish colour, not only <HI>Eggs</HI> of an <HI>ellypticall</HI> form, but in one that he open'd (by the help of a <HI>Microscope</HI>) a young flea compleatly formed in all its parts, of a <HI>whitish</HI> colour, where∣in it seems they not only agree with the <HI>Moores</HI> in being <HI>viviparous Animals,</HI> but also in that they produce their young <HI>white,</HI> though they become <HI>black</HI> after, which too hang to the old ones for some time after they are excluded, whence 'tis so frequent to catch an old <HI>flea</HI> and a young at the same time.

<P N="23">23. There are another sort of <HI>insects</HI> too <HI>de genere</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which in some sence also may be allowed to <HI>fly,</HI> such are all <HI>Spiders</HI> (ex∣cept those long-legged ones we call <HI>Shepherds,</HI> which never spin any <HI>thred</HI>) which in <HI>October</HI> cheifly, will turn up their <HI>tailes</HI> and project one or more <HI>threds</HI> with that violence, that they shall reach cross <HI>roomes</HI> over <HI>rivers,</HI> and be fastened betwixt <HI>trees,</HI> in <HI>plano Horizontis,</HI> at several <HI>fathoms</HI> distance; and sometimes will dart them into the <HI>Air</HI> to such a <HI>length,</HI> that the <HI>Spiders</HI> leap∣ing up after them, will be carryed into the <HI>air,</HI> and there <HI>saile</HI> at the end of these <HI>threds</HI> to a great height and distance: by which means it is that the <HI>trees, hedges, stubble,</HI> and the <HI>air</HI> it self, is so fill'd with these <HI>threds,</HI> some single and some complicated, as we frequently see they are at that time of year. The <HI>discovery</HI> whereof seems to have been made much about the same time both by Dr. <HI>Lister</HI> and Dr. <HI>Hulse</HI> as plainly appears in the <HI>Philosophical
<PB N="239" REF="161"/>Transactions</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Philosoph. Transact. Numb. <HI>50.</HI> and <HI>65.</HI></NOTE>. Since which, the same thing has also been ob∣served by divers others, particularly in this <HI>County</HI> by the ingeni∣ous Mr. <HI>King,</HI> Chaplain to Mr. <HI>Chetwynd,</HI> from whose notes I shall only add such matter, as was not so fully observed by the a∣forementioned <HI>Authors.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. As first, that in their projecting a <HI>thred</HI> cross a roome <HI>in plano Horizontis</HI> (which they doe for their easier and more direct passage) they raise themselves on their leggs as high as they can, setting them very straight and stiff, and turning their hinder parts up higher than usual, they will shoot out a thred to a great di∣stance, which when fastened where they would have it, with their fore leggs they will winde up the thred shorter till it is very straight, as the <HI>Funambuli</HI> strain their roaps, and then like them too, will get upon it, and run from one end to the other. And as to their <HI>sailing</HI> at the ends of these <HI>threds,</HI> he further observed, not only that they <HI>sailed</HI> much swifter, than any <HI>wind</HI> then stir∣ring could carry them, but that at the same time they constantly <HI>sailed</HI> all the same way, which was not directly with, but as he once noted at 8 points distance, as it were with a side-winde; which plainly shews that they doe not only <HI>row,</HI> but <HI>steer</HI> too, with the motion of their feet, according as directed by some secret instinct they have in them.</P>
<P N="25">25. Having done both with the <HI>Insects</HI> that really <HI>flye,</HI> and that doe so only in a larger sence, I proceed next to such as live in the <HI>waters;</HI> whereof my worthy friend <HI>Francis Wolferstan</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> sent me one, out of many, he found swiming about in filthy wa∣ter, that stood a yard deep, in the bottom of a large hollow <HI>Elme;</HI> which I cannot find after long search, but is wholy undescribed: the bodies of them being better than an inch long, and ¼ of an inch <HI>diameter;</HI> full, white, and round; and the outer Skin upon back and belly made up from head to taile of <HI>protuberant Ridges,</HI> those under the <HI>belly</HI> at <HI>a</HI> not shooting right against those on the <HI>back</HI> or <HI>sides,</HI> but against the <HI>furrows</HI> between them, which coun∣terchanging of the <HI>ridges</HI> make the the <HI>indentures</HI> on the sides; the <HI>head</HI> striated, with <HI>antennae</HI> issuing from a flat roundish face; the body fill'd with so thin a white matter, that they are in a manner transparent, in so much that a sort of <HI>peristaltick</HI> mo∣tion may sometimes be perceived in them; having 14 short feet (7 on each side) much like those of a Maggot two being placed in the ends of every other semicircle of the belly; &amp; a joynted ta∣pring taile four or five inches long as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 22. <HI>Fig.</HI> 3. which they can contract to an inch, and extend it again at pleasure to its full length. Whence 'tis plain that it is a sort of <HI>Eruca,</HI> but such
<PB N="240" REF="162"/>an one as I find not described, which perhaps may not unfitly be stiled <HI>eruca glabra caudata aquatico-arborea,</HI> but I tye not up the <HI>Reader</HI> from his better choise, of a more agreeable <HI>name,</HI> if here∣after from further knowledg of the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>Animal,</HI> he can impose a better on it.</P>
<P N="26">26. Thus being come to the <HI>waters,</HI> and having done with the <HI>Insects;</HI> nature directs me next to proceed to the <HI>Fishes,</HI> the most frequent Inhabitants of that <HI>element:</HI> which, here in this in∣land <HI>Country,</HI> being only <HI>fresh,</HI> such as is contain'd in <HI>Rivers, Lakes,</HI> and <HI>Pooles,</HI> nothing must be expected concerning fish here, but such only as are either <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> usually living in <HI>Rivers;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> commonly found in <HI>Lakes;</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that are kept in <HI>ponds</HI> or <HI>Stews;</HI> or in one, more, or all of these. Of which kinds there are so many in this <HI>County,</HI> that some have fancyed no less than thirty sorts in the River <HI>Trent,</HI> as if a corrupt name by contraction from <HI>triginta;</HI> but this I take but for the imagination of some fond <HI>Etymologist:</HI> however I think there may be as many here of all these kinds, as in any other such inland <HI>County,</HI> where there can be none of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that for certain intervalls of time live both at <HI>Sea,</HI> and in <HI>rivers:</HI> and yet I could hear of but one amongst them all, that I think undescribed, and that one of the <HI>smooth</HI> sort, without <HI>Scales,</HI> and for its solitary way of living, of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, there having not above four of them been catch't, that I could hear of, within memory, and these all single without any company, no not so much as of their own kind.</P>

W. of <HI>Wednesbury,</HI> into which <HI>Pike, Carp, Tench, Perch,</HI> &amp;c. being put for breed,
<PB N="242" REF="163"/>they not only lived, but grew and thrived to as large a magnitude, as perhaps they would have done any where else, and were to the <HI>palate</HI> as gratefull: so that though the <HI>canckerd waters</HI> that are long stagnant in the hollows of the <HI>old</HI> works, will destroy fish, as was hinted in the end of the second <HI>Chapter</HI> of this <HI>Book</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chap.</HI> 2. § 129.</NOTE>, yet it is not so in waters that fill up the <HI>open-works,</HI> which con∣stantly enjoy the ventilations of the Air, and the sweet influences of the <HI>heavens</HI> both night and day.</P>
<P N="30">30. There are other fish too, both of the <HI>scaled</HI> and <HI>shell'd</HI> kinds, that will live and breed in places very uncommon to their <HI>species:</HI> thus <HI>Gudgeons</HI> and <HI>Crevices</HI> live well and breed in the <HI>pooles</HI> at <HI>Bentley,</HI> and thrive to a just magnitude, but then these ponds are always fedd with <HI>Springs.</HI> Others there are a∣gain, that though they will live in unsuitable places, yet will never <HI>spawn</HI> there; and such were the <HI>Carps</HI> the right Honorable the Lord <HI>Ferrers</HI> took forth the poole at <HI>Drineton,</HI> whose <HI>spawn</HI> still lyeing in their bodies and increasing yearly, distended their bellys into such various ill shapes, that they appear'd monstrous, the spawn when boyled being of the colour and consistence of <HI>red wax;</HI> and yet the fish as good meat as others of the kind. Other <HI>waters</HI> again are so very disagreeable, that though fish may live in them, yet they will not thrive, but rather pine away, as Mr. <HI>Chetwynd</HI> found it in a parcell of <HI>roaches</HI> he put into a pond in his park at <HI>Ingestre,</HI> whence after some time being taken forth again, they were all grown slenderer than when first put in, and become almost of the shape of <HI>herrings.</HI></P>
<P N="31">31. But for <HI>breeding,</HI> and <HI>living,</HI> there is no fish so wonderfull amongst all the <HI>scaly</HI> or <HI>shelly</HI> kinds, as there is one amongst the <HI>smooth</HI> ones, <HI>viz.</HI> the common <HI>Eele;</HI> which is not only <HI>vivi∣parous,</HI> as may be easily found in the <HI>Month</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> as has been observ'd by the ingenious <HI>Walter Chetwynd</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> by cutting open the red and swell'd fundaments of the <HI>females,</HI> whence the young <HI>Eeles</HI> will then issue forth: but will live, and sometimes take journeys <HI>in arido,</HI> passing over land from <HI>Lakes</HI> and <HI>Pooles</HI> they doe not like, to others they like better: by this means many times <HI>stocking</HI> waters of themselves, which were not so before. Thus 'tis said the <HI>waters</HI> of the <HI>Coal-pit-open-works</HI> S.

Insomuch that some have imagined upon such ac∣counts as these (never so much as dreaming they could be <HI>night wal∣kers</HI>) that <HI>Eeles</HI> are many times produced of a peculiar <HI>dew</HI> (no melt
<PB N="243" REF="163"/>or <HI>spawn</HI> being ever found in them) falling in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June</HI> upon the blades of the grass, whereof <HI>turffs</HI> being cut, and the grassy sides clapt together, and then laid on the warmest side of a well∣promising poole, thence by the <HI>Suns</HI> heat in a few hours will spring a competent number of young <HI>Eeles</HI> by <HI>Equivocal</HI> gene∣ration. In which Experiment <HI>Abrah. Myllius</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Abrah. Mylii de origine Animalium Lib. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>G. Mar∣hofius</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">D. G.

<P N="32">32. Now though I dare not pronounce either that <HI>Lakes</HI> or <HI>pooles,</HI> are impossible to be stock't after this <HI>Belgic</HI> manner; yet I think it much more probable of the two, that it may be done the <HI>travelling</HI> way: for most certain it is that <HI>Eeles</HI> are such <HI>night-walkers,</HI> as was suggested above, having been actually catch't in the very fact near <HI>Bilston,</HI> creeping over the <HI>Meddows</HI> like so many <HI>Snakes</HI> from one ditch to another, by Mr. <HI>Moseley</HI> of <HI>Moseley,</HI> who seriously told me they not only did it for bettering their <HI>station,</HI> but as he apprehended, also for catching of <HI>Snails</HI> in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> the best time of year for them. Which yet I could have hardly believed (though the <HI>Gent.</HI> gave me licence to quote him for it) but that I have since met with so many <HI>Autho∣rities</HI> both ancient and modern, that seem to render the thing probable, if not almost certain. Insomuch that <HI>Seneca</HI> amongst the rest, makes it a pleasant wonder, that any body should doubt it: <HI>Quid est autem</HI> (says he) <HI>quare pisces in terram non tran∣seant, cum nos maria transimus</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">L.

<P N="34">34. There are very many <HI>fishes</HI> too that take a great latitude in the variety of their <HI>feeding,</HI> as well as <HI>habitation;</HI> which too a∣mongst some of them is very unusual and surprising. Mr. <HI>Fisher Dilk An.</HI> 1679 laying a <HI>Dace-bait</HI> for a <HI>Pike</HI> near <HI>Salters bridg</HI> in the river <HI>Tame,</HI> catch't a large <HI>Barbel</HI> with it; and the same Mr. <HI>Dilk</HI> found a good <HI>trout</HI> in <HI>Stafford Castle</HI> choak't with a <HI>Crevice;</HI> which it seems they will not <HI>Perch,</HI> for Mr. <HI>Morse</HI> Vicar of the <HI>Collegiat</HI> Church of <HI>Stafford,</HI> catch't several of these in <HI>July</HI> with <HI>Crevices</HI> in their bellies; the same Mr. <HI>Morse</HI> once catch't a <HI>Trout</HI> in <HI>Dunsmoore</HI> river, with <HI>Neuts, Efts,</HI> or <HI>Askers</HI> in its belly; and the Worshipfull <HI>Walter Chetwynd</HI> of <HI>Ingestre</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in a pit near the high way in <HI>Heywood</HI> field, catch't large <HI>Chubbs,</HI> with <HI>Toads</HI> in their gorges. The ravenous <HI>Pike</HI> too, will not only swallow ve∣nomous <HI>toads</HI> and <HI>froggs</HI> without being harmed by them, but will devour things somtimes bigger and longer than his <HI>gorge</HI> will receive, swallowing one part, and letting the other remain

<P N="35">35. Nor doth this <HI>fresh-water Wolf</HI> only seize <HI>Froggs</HI> and <HI>fish,</HI> but upon <HI>fowle,</HI> and other <HI>Animals</HI> not of that Element. Thus in the moat at <HI>Himley,</HI> the <HI>Jacks</HI> are so bold with the young <HI>Ducks,</HI> that as the Reverend Mr <HI>Paston Rector</HI> of the place seriously in∣form'd me, a whole brood of young <HI>ducks</HI> had been destroyed there by them in a <HI>days</HI> time; and this the larger <HI>Jacks</HI> will doe, even when these <HI>ducks</HI> are grown near as bigg as the old ones: whereof one was catch't (having taken in such a <HI>duck</HI> the wrong way) that could not gorge it so farr, but that the <HI>Ducks</HI> head hung out of his <HI>mouth;</HI> in which posture both <HI>Jack</HI> and <HI>Duck,</HI> were hung up in the <HI>Hall</HI> of <HI>Himley</HI> house, to be admired, as long as the stench would permit.

Nay of so bold and greedy a devouring disposition is this <HI>Tyrant</HI> of the <HI>Rivers,</HI> when He is in the height of his hunger, that as Mr <HI>Wal∣ton</HI> acquaints us, there have been instances of it, that a large <HI>Pike</HI> has bit at, and devoured a <HI>dogg,</HI> that ha's been swimming in the water<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is.

<P N="36">36.

Which though wonderfull <HI>Examples</HI> of the rave∣nous disposition of this <HI>Animal,</HI> yet 'tis plain that many times they doe not so much as kill the prey they swallow, with their teeth by the way; whereof I met with two signal instances that fell out lately in this <HI>County.</HI></P>
<P N="37">37. One at the <HI>Black-Lake</HI> near <HI>Aqualat,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Skrym∣sher</HI> having catch't a <HI>Jack,</HI> that his Cosin <HI>Skrymsher</HI> of <HI>Norbury,</HI> who was present at the <HI>fishing,</HI> suspected might have a <HI>Carp</HI> in his belly, upon opening his mouth found he had gotten one so
<PB N="246" REF="165"/>large, and so very lately, that they could visibly perceive the <HI>tail</HI> of it stirr, which Mr <HI>Skrymsher</HI> of <HI>Aqualat</HI> by stroaking him on the belly, quickly made Him disgorge, there remaining so much <HI>life</HI> in him (the <HI>digestion</HI> having only a little touch't his <HI>Eyes</HI>) that being put into the <HI>water,</HI> after some time, it swam away leasura∣bly as if not at all disturbed. And the other at <HI>Rugeley,</HI> where Mr <HI>Chetwynd</HI> of <HI>Ingestre</HI> being fishing with his Cosin <HI>Chetwynd</HI> of the same town, amongst many other <HI>fish</HI> they catch't a <HI>Jack</HI> with somewhat a bigg belly, which being open'd, they found divers <HI>fishes</HI> had been swallowed by it, and amongst the rest a <HI>Roach</HI> so intire (the end of its <HI>nose</HI> being only a little touch't with the <HI>concoction</HI>) that being put into a <HI>Cistern,</HI> it shewed quickly so much life, that after a while being put into the <HI>River</HI> it swamm briskly away.</P>
<P N="38">38. Lastly, as for the unusual <HI>magnitude</HI> of <HI>fishes,</HI> those which have exceeded most of any I heard of; are, 1. a large sort of <HI>Gudgeons</HI> in the <HI>black-brook;</HI> whereof some have been taken in the Lordship of <HI>Hynts,</HI> belonging to the courteous Mr. <HI>Mat∣thew Floyer,</HI> from the tip of the nose to the fork of the tail 7 in∣ches long, and 4 inches about. 2<SUP>ly</SUP>. <HI>Carps;</HI> of which kind there are vast ones in the <HI>Meer</HI> at <HI>Aqualat,</HI> but two there were taken (as I was punctually informed by the learned and ingenious <HI>Proprietor</HI> of the place <HI>Edwyn Skrymsher</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a most generous promoter of this <HI>History,</HI> whose pleasant seat is here represented <HI>Tab.</HI> 20.) more remarkably great: One, a <HI>Melter</HI> 33 inches long and 19½ inches about, weighing 15 pounds. And the other a <HI>Spawner,</HI> which though not above two foot 6 inches long or thereabout, yet was 20½ inches round, weighing 14 pounds, and sold for 14 shillings; the <HI>Scales</HI> of each being near as broad, as one of our mill'd <HI>half Crownes.</HI> And 3<SUP>ly</SUP>. <HI>Jacks;</HI> whereof there hangs a picture of one in <HI>Cumberford</HI> hall taken in the River <HI>Tame, Dec.</HI> 16, 1673, an <HI>Ell</HI> and 2 inches long when first taken, but as drawn there in the picture but a <HI>yard</HI> and ¼ and ½ an inche from the tip of the nose, to the fork of the tail; and there are of them in the moat at <HI>Himley</HI> a yard and half long. And yet even these would be found but of an inconsiderable magnitude, if compared with the <HI>Pikes</HI> of the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Geneva,</HI> where they sometimes catch them of 80 pounds weight, reckoning too (ac∣cording to the account of <HI>Geneva</HI>) 18 ounces to the pound<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Philosoph.

<P N="39">39. Which is all I met worthy notice relating to <HI>fishes;</HI> and yet I have not done neither with the <HI>inhabitants</HI> of the <HI>waters;</HI> for though I come next to treat of the <HI>Quadrupeda</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>digi∣tated

<PB N="247" REF="167"/>Quadrupeds,</HI> there being some of them <HI>oviparous,</HI> as almost all fishes are; and sometimes at least frequenting the same <HI>Ele∣ment;</HI> I must in all reason first dipatch what I have remarkable concerning such <HI>Animals,</HI> before I proceed to others that are purely <HI>terrestrial.</HI> Amongst which the <HI>Toad</HI> must be reckon'd as one; which though living both at <HI>land,</HI> and in the <HI>water,</HI> is some∣times most wonderfully excluded from <HI>both,</HI> having been fre¦quently found close imprison'd within the middle of solid blocks of <HI>Stone,</HI> without any perceivable <HI>rift</HI> or <HI>cleft,</HI> either whereby they were first admitted, or were supplyed with <HI>Air,</HI> during their abode there; a thing so frequent in this <HI>County,</HI> that I met with instances of it in divers places: and first at <HI>Horton,</HI> at the house of Mr. <HI>Edg,</HI> where in his barn wall, he shewed me a hol∣low Stone which being clove by the <HI>Mason</HI> had a <HI>live Toad</HI> includ∣ed in it; this he told me he saw himself, and that it dyed quickly, after it was taken forth.</P>
<P N="40">40. The same happen'd again at <HI>Knypersley</HI> near by, at the right Worshipfull Sr. <HI>John Bowyers</HI> Baronet; at <HI>Ingestre</HI> at Mr. <HI>Chetwynds;</HI> and as I was told by Mr. <HI>Launder,</HI> at the Village of <HI>Brocton;</HI> the learned Dr. <HI>Pierce</HI> Physician at <HI>Bath,</HI> in a Letter to the ingenious Mr. <HI>William Musgrave</HI> Secretary of the <HI>Philosophi∣cal Society</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> sent us lately an account also of such a <HI>Toad</HI> found in the Center of a hard <HI>lime-stone,</HI> laid as a step-stone for passengers in the middle of a <HI>Cartway</HI> between two <HI>rills</HI> that ran of each side it; where a <HI>croaking</HI> noise being a long time heard, and the parts near search't and nothing found, this stone at length was resolved should be broke, where in a cavity near the middle, a large <HI>Toad</HI> was found as <HI>bigg</HI> as a mans fist, which hop't about as briskly, as if it had been bread in a larger room; but for how long time he does not say<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Letter Book of the <HI>Philosoph.

But the <HI>Toad</HI> that was found in the most astonishing manner, certainly that ever was heard of, was that at <HI>Statfold,</HI> if the tradition they have of it there be true, where as the story goes, the <HI>Steeple</HI> being to be taken down to prevent falling, the top-stone of the <HI>Spire</HI> or <HI>Pinnacle</HI> being taken off, was thrown down whole into the <HI>Church-yard,</HI> but breaking in the fall, there appear'd a <HI>living Toad</HI> in the Center of it, which (as most of the rest are said to doe) dyed quickly after it was ex∣posed to the Air.</P>

They are also sometimes met with in this <HI>County</HI> as closely included in the bodies of <HI>firm trees:</HI> thus out of a great <HI>Oak</HI> that grew at <HI>Lapley</HI> of about 6 Tunns of timber, brought to <HI>Elmhurst,</HI> by the right Worshipfull Sr. <HI>Theophilus Biddulph</HI> Baronet for the new bulding the house, represented above in <HI>Tab.</HI> 2. there was a great <HI>Toad</HI> sawn forth of the middle of the tree, in a place which when growing, was 12 or 14 foot from the ground; the <HI>tree</HI> being sound and intire in all parts quit round, saving just where the <HI>Toad</HI> lay, it was black and corrupted, and crumbled away like <HI>Saw∣dust.</HI> Also at <HI>Bently</HI> there was another sawn out of a solid tree, in that part of it, that when growing, might be about a yard from the ground; the tree sound underneath next the root, and in all other parts, only where the <HI>toad</HI> lay, there was a hollow about the bigness of the crown of ones hat, which (as those in∣closed in <HI>Stone</HI>) also presently dyed, as soon as exposed to the <HI>Air.</HI> Now how these <HI>Animals</HI> should come at all to be thus in∣cluded, in the middle of such <HI>intire</HI> and <HI>solid</HI> substances? and when inclosed, how maintained either with <HI>breath,</HI> or <HI>aliment?</HI> and how long they may have been presumed, to have continued there? seem <HI>questions</HI> indeed worthy the consideration of the most profound <HI>Philosopher;</HI> whome that I may honestly pro∣voke to give a better, I shall here offer the <HI>Reader</HI> some account of my <HI>owne,</HI> which though a slender one enough, yet may serve his turne, till he can get a better, and in some measure to evince the probability of the thing.</P>
<P N="43">43. To come then close to the business, upon presumption that the <HI>matter</HI> of <HI>fact</HI> is indisputable; 'tis easy to apprehend how <HI>Toads</HI> creep into the clefts and hollows of <HI>rocks</HI> and <HI>trees</HI> (which
<PB N="249" REF="168"/>they always doe in <HI>August,</HI> when they are in a declining condi∣tion) to preserve themselves i'th <HI>winter:</HI> where during their rest for about eight months, they grow somwhat bigger, and the clefts or holes of the <HI>rocks</HI> or <HI>trees,</HI> as much less; so that at the return of the <HI>year</HI> (like the <HI>Fox</HI> in the <HI>Fable</HI>) they cannot get out, where they came in, and so are forced to remain where they are, in that solitary condition, as long as they live; the clefts and holes of the <HI>rocks</HI> and <HI>trees</HI> in the mean time growing quite up, and in∣closing them in an <HI>intire</HI> and <HI>solid</HI> case. And thus I suppose these <HI>animals</HI> may come to be inclosed in the <HI>rocks</HI> and <HI>trees,</HI> upon or near the surface of the earth. But how that <HI>Toad</HI> in the <HI>tree</HI> at <HI>Lapley,</HI> should come to be thus imprisoned 12 or 14 foot high? is a difficulty yet harder, and that requires yet nicer considera∣tions.</P>
<P N="44">44. For the <HI>Solution</HI> whereof, we must either suppose that the <HI>Toad</HI> was produced in a <HI>hole</HI> at that height when the <HI>tree</HI> was <HI>young,</HI> of an agreeable <HI>dust,</HI> brought thither by the <HI>wind</HI> and a sort of <HI>rain</HI> as well disposed for the same purpose; like the <HI>worms</HI> and <HI>maggots</HI> bred of <HI>dust,</HI> and the <HI>rains</HI> that accompany the <HI>Tornado blasts,</HI> and fall in the <HI>Maggoti Savanna</HI> in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> by equivocal generation, as was shewn in <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. § §. 48, 49. of this <HI>book:</HI> or else according to the opinion of <HI>Cardan,</HI> generated of the seed of a <HI>Toad</HI> blown from the top of the some Mountain; or drawn up by the <HI>Sun</HI> into the <HI>Clouds,</HI> and so discharged thence in a shower, and lodg'd in the <HI>bole</HI> of this <HI>tree</HI> whilst young: whence fearing to leap in the <HI>Summer,</HI> and creeping down low in the <HI>dust,</HI> usually lodg'd in the <HI>boles</HI> of all <HI>trees,</HI> in the <HI>Winter,</HI> and there keeping its Station for a long Season; the wood of the <HI>tree</HI> in a little time might thus grow over it, so that the tree be∣ing trimm'd up, and a taller body given it, the <HI>Toad</HI> at length thus appear'd to be inclosed in the <HI>body</HI> of the <HI>tree</HI> at that height.</P>

<P N="50">50.

<P N="51">51. Amongst the <HI>viviparous digitated Quadrupeds</HI> though I met none undescribed, yet some there were attended with so very unusual <HI>accidents,</HI> that they must not be past by; and such was the <HI>Rabbit</HI> taken in <HI>Salt</HI> warren, that had two teeth grow∣ing out of the lower <HI>jaw,</HI> that turned round over the <HI>nose</HI> above the upper <HI>jaw,</HI> with that length and compass, that they almost touch't the <HI>forehead</HI> in the return, as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 22. <HI>Fig.</HI> 6. which surely must so incommode the <HI>animal</HI> in feeding, that I see not which way it could performe to it self, that most necessary good office, unless by licking in its food on each side the mouth: but this inconvenience it seems was not so great, as what it met with at last upon account of these <HI>teeth,</HI> by which it was taken, and kill'd, being hang'd by them in a hedge; so that though they did not occasion it's <HI>death</HI> by starveing, it did it as effectually ano∣ther way. And yet for a <HI>Rabbit</HI> to have such <HI>teeth</HI> as these, is not so very extraordinary, but there have been others seen like it at other places, particularly as I was told by the Lady <HI>Offley,</HI> at S<SUP>r</SUP>.

<P N="53">53. Which how it should come to pass is hard to conceive, otherwise than either by the stoppage of the <HI>Cornua Ʋteri</HI> by the corruption of the <HI>Faetus</HI> of some former impregnation; or a too long stay of the <HI>Egg</HI> in the <HI>Ovarium,</HI> where it acquired a growth too great before it fell, to pass the <HI>Tube</HI> into the <HI>Womb:</HI> in both which cases the <HI>Embryo</HI> must necessarily continue and be formed in the <HI>Testicle,</HI> whence by the extension in its growth, it must also as necessarily force its way through it, into some part of the <HI>Ab∣domen.</HI> As it was in the case of a <HI>hound Bitch</HI> of the right Ho∣norable <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Abbington,</HI> which being with whelp, by an unfortunate blow, had her <HI>Faetus</HI> dyed in her, whereof she dis∣charged a great part in putrid matter and flesh by the <HI>Pudendum,</HI> and was afterward able to run again in the <HI>pack:</HI> but the bones, firmer muscles, and thicker Skins of the <HI>Embryos</HI> yet remaining within her, so stufft up the horns of her <HI>Womb,</HI> that the <HI>Eggs</HI> up∣on a second impregnation, finding no passage there, were forced back into divers parts of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> whereby (her belly being distended into very ill shapes) she after some time dyed.

Thus <HI>horns, wool,</HI> or <HI>hair,</HI> exposed to the <HI>flames,</HI> are furl∣ed up, and send forth the same <HI>nauseous sent;</HI> so that <HI>hair,</HI> and <HI>wool,</HI> seem to be nothing else but <HI>imperfect horne,</HI> or the <HI>fibres</HI> of <HI>horn</HI> seperated, and not <HI>fasciated</HI> together as they are in intire <HI>horns</HI> and <HI>hoofs,</HI> and as the <HI>stalks</HI> of some <HI>plants</HI> are, when there is an <HI>exuberancy</HI> of matter: <HI>haire, wool,</HI> or <HI>weak hornes</HI> being then produced, when the <HI>Juices</HI> whence they spring, are some way <HI>de∣pauperated;</HI> and <HI>strong horns,</HI> when they abound and are vigorous. Whence it is that <HI>Bulls</HI> whose blood and seminal juices, are spi∣rituous, hot, and plentifull; have thick, short, and strong <HI>horns,</HI> in proportion to the hair of <HI>Men</HI> of robust Constitutions, which is commonly short, course, and curled: whereas <HI>Oxen,</HI> whose blood and juices by <HI>castration</HI> is in great measure enervated, produce but a thin, weak, and long horn, in proportion to the hair of <HI>wo∣men,</HI> which is generally longer, finer, and less curled, than that of <HI>Men.</HI> But in some <HI>Sheep,</HI> and all <HI>deer,</HI> whose blood and semi∣nal juices are much less vigorous than that of <HI>Bulls,</HI> the <HI>superfluous juices</HI> that give both birth and augmentation to <HI>horns,</HI> are so di∣minisht and weaken'd in them by <HI>castration,</HI> that they can afford
<PB N="257" REF="174"/>no supply for the production of them at all, but only of <HI>wool</HI> or <HI>hair</HI> which as I said before are an imperfect sort of <HI>horn;</HI> whence it comes to pass that <HI>Weathers</HI> (these <HI>superfluous juices</HI> being now wholy spent in the production of <HI>wool</HI>) are said to have greater <HI>fleeces</HI> than other <HI>sheep;</HI> and that <HI>Staggs</HI> and <HI>Bucks</HI> if gelt, never mew their <HI>heads</HI> like other <HI>deer,</HI> there being now no new mat∣ter to cause a new <HI>horn</HI> to put up, and thrust off the old one.</P>
<P N="60">60. Yet in some sort of <HI>Sheep</HI> these <HI>superfluous juices</HI> are so very plentifull and strange, that they produce 4 or 6, and sometimes eight <HI>horns</HI> upon the head of the same <HI>Sheep;</HI> whereof there are plenty with <HI>four</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> at <HI>Gnosall, Knightley, Blore,</HI> and <HI>Ingestre</HI> parks; and as I was told there were of them formerly in the park at <HI>Loxley; Johnston</HI> gives us a <HI>Cutt</HI> of one of them, cal∣ling it <HI>Hircus Cotilardicus</HI> with six horns<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Joh.

<P N="61">61. <HI>Sheep</HI> then being reckon'd amongst the <HI>cornigerous Qua∣drupeds,</HI> as seldom being otherwise but upon accident only; let us return again after this long, but I hope not impertinent di∣gression, to such uncommon <HI>accidents</HI> as have been found to at∣tend them in this <HI>County.</HI> For I account it but accidental, that they have in the <HI>Moorelands</HI> a peculiar sort of them, that have all <HI>black noses,</HI> which thrive well enough on the barrennest Soile, and produce pretty good wool, yet too long for the use of the <HI>Felt-makers</HI> of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> unless for <HI>childrens</HI> hatts, which they attribute wholy to the <HI>Limestone</HI> rocks on which it is bred; the best being produced upon dry Sandy Soils, such as <HI>Beech, Swyn∣nerton,
<PB N="258" REF="175"/>Mare, Chedleton,</HI> and <HI>Drayton,</HI> of which (being pretty short and fine) they make some use; but cheifly of the wools of <HI>Shropshire,</HI> and <HI>Lemster:</HI> most of the shortest and finest wools of this <HI>County</HI> being ordinarily sold into <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Glocester shires;</HI> and their longest, which are bred in the moister Soiles, which they otherwise call <HI>broad-wools,</HI> into <HI>York-shire</HI> and <HI>Lancashire,</HI> where they make courser clothes.</P>
<P N="62">62. It being ordinary for <HI>Sheep</HI> to breed but once in a year, it may perhaps be remarkable, what was told me by the worthy Mr <HI>Bott</HI> of <HI>Dunstall, viz.</HI> that he had a <HI>Sheep</HI> about 12 years agoe, that brought him one <HI>Lamb</HI> at <HI>Christmass,</HI> and another at S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>James</HI> tide after; and another <HI>Ewe</HI> that had two <HI>Lambs</HI> about three weeks before <HI>Christmass,</HI> a third about a week after <HI>Midsummer,</HI> and a fourth upon <HI>twelft day</HI> following; so that within thirteen months she brought 4 <HI>Lambs</HI> at three yeanings: the latter where∣of were both <HI>superfetations,</HI> occasioned no question by goeing to <HI>Ramm</HI> at so many distant times. Whence 'tis plain that such <HI>Animals</HI> as these will admit of <HI>coition</HI> after impregnation as well as <HI>Mares</HI> and <HI>Women;</HI> in the former whereof though <HI>Aristotle</HI> al∣lows no <HI>superfetations</HI> to have ever happen'd, yet in the latter he affords us several <HI>Examples:</HI> more particularly of an <HI>Adulteress,</HI> who was delivered of one child like her <HI>husband;</HI> and of another after, like the <HI>Adulterer;</HI> and of two others that had two children at a birth, and a third five months after<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Aristotelis Hist.

And of later years D<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Harvey</HI> tells us of a <HI>Servant</HI> Maid gotten with child by her <HI>Master,</HI> that was sent to <HI>London</HI> in <HI>September</HI> to hide her shame, where being brough to bed well, and returning home, had ano∣ther unexspectedly in <HI>December,</HI> whereby her own and <HI>Masters</HI> faults (before successfully concealed) were unhappily discovered<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gul.

It is also very remarkable in the breeding of <HI>Deer</HI> (which are also reckon'd amongst the <HI>horned Animals</HI> that chew the <HI>Cudd</HI> though the females never have any) that they sometimes cast <HI>Fawnes</HI> with their lower jaws so short, that they cannot suck, and so consequently all dye; and it is no less observable, that these short jawed <HI>Fawnes</HI> are all <HI>white</HI> ones, as if this were a colour of imperfection in <HI>Animals,</HI> as well as in <HI>Plants</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Nat.

<P N="64">64. The same I have heard has likewise happen'd to a <HI>Doe</HI> in <HI>Woodstock</HI> park in the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Oxon.</HI> And at some other places: and in the parke at <HI>Ingestre</HI> a <HI>Hare</HI> was kill'd some time since, that had all the bones and furr of a young <HI>Hare</HI> in her, complicated up together into a round ball: which <HI>accidents</HI> are so far from al∣ways proveing mortal to these <HI>Animals,</HI> that they may possibly be impregnated after them, and produce other <HI>Fawns,</HI> or <HI>Hares,</HI> these <HI>bones</HI> of the former dead <HI>Faetus</HI>'s still remaining within them: for I know not why a <HI>Doe</HI> or <HI>Hare</HI> should not be capable of this, as well as a <HI>Cow</HI> or <HI>Woman:</HI> there haveing been a <HI>Cow</HI> kill'd at <HI>Hopton</HI> in this <HI>County</HI> that had an intire perfect <HI>calf,</HI> and the <HI>bones</HI> of another found in her; and <HI>Katherine Parry</HI> of the parish of <HI>Kintbury</HI> in <HI>Berkshire</HI> haveing been deliverd of a child <HI>An.</HI> 1668 after she had had a human <HI>Faetus</HI> dyed in her: as appeared from a great quantity of <HI>corruption,</HI> with several pieces of <HI>flesh</HI> and <HI>skin,</HI> that came from her two or three days after her <HI>delivery,</HI> and from divers <HI>bones</HI> that she voided with her monthly evacuations, with several parts of a <HI>Skull,</HI> and some of the larger <HI>bones</HI> of the body of a <HI>Faetus,</HI> that work't their way through her flesh above the <HI>Os Pubis</HI> five years after: within which time she conceived again 3 several times, and had 3 children more at 3 following <HI>births,</HI> after the last of which only these <HI>bones</HI> came away<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Journal.

<P N="65">65. Beside these unusual <HI>accidents</HI> in the breeding of <HI>Deer,</HI> there are many others worth notice that have happen'd to some of them, since their being <HI>cast,</HI> in relation to their <HI>heads:</HI> many of the <HI>redd deer</HI> in <HI>Chartley</HI> park having no <HI>heads</HI> at all, others
<PB N="260" REF="176"/>being <HI>Ʋnicorns,</HI> and those that have but one horn, that but a dwarf one neither, and commonly very irregular; the <HI>deer</HI> not∣withstanding being as well grown in their bodies, and as <HI>warran∣table</HI> in their season, as in any of the neighbouring <HI>Forrests</HI> or <HI>Parks,</HI> where they put up as <HI>fair heads,</HI> as in any parts of <HI>England.</HI> Which abatement therefore of their <HI>heads,</HI> must needs proceed, either from some defect in the <HI>Park;</HI> or some accidental <HI>altera∣tion</HI> of the soil; as it happen'd at <HI>Cornbury</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> where the stocking the park with <HI>Conys</HI> only, made all the <HI>deer</HI> thus a∣bate of their <HI>heads,</HI> upon what account see the <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Oxford∣shire</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Nat. Hist. of Oxfordsh. Chap. <HI>7.</HI> §. <HI>45.</HI></NOTE>. But the <HI>reason</HI> there given having no place here, I can assigne no other so probable as the <HI>want</HI> of <HI>brouse</HI> in this park, the underwoods being but inconsiderable in respect of its extent, and the trees most of them dead, as represented in the <HI>Map,</HI> the <HI>leaves</HI> and young <HI>Cions</HI> of plants supplying it seems fit∣ter matter for the <HI>heads</HI> of <HI>deer,</HI> than grass or other forrage. But whether this will hold at <HI>Wyse-wood</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> where I hear there are also <HI>Staggs,</HI> some with no <HI>horns,</HI> others with very short ones; I have yet had no opportunity of learning.</P>
<P N="66">66. Other irregular <HI>Bucks-heads</HI> I met with at <HI>Ingestre</HI> and <HI>Dud∣ley,</HI> and some other places: that in the Hall at <HI>Ingestre</HI> being a large <HI>head</HI> of a full grown <HI>Buck,</HI> which put up all the time from the <HI>burrs</HI> only two smooth <HI>beams,</HI> having indeed <HI>brow-Antlers,</HI> but no <HI>back</HI> ones, <HI>palm,</HI> or <HI>spellers,</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 22. <HI>Fig.</HI> 11. Such a∣nother <HI>head</HI> as this I met with at <HI>Tortworth</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> in the Hall of the right Honorable the Lady Viscountess <HI>Downe;</HI> so that I cannot look upon this as a single accident, but one that happens sometimes, though not frequently. The other at <HI>Dudley,</HI> is of a living white-<HI>Buck,</HI> kept within the <HI>Castle</HI> by the right Honora∣ble the Lord <HI>Ward,</HI> which puts up annually form the <HI>burrs</HI> only two <HI>beams,</HI> without either <HI>brow</HI> or <HI>back-Antlers, palm,</HI> or <HI>spellers,</HI> ascending pretty straight, and adorned at the top with <HI>balls</HI> or <HI>knobbs,</HI> as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 22. <HI>Fig.</HI> 12.</P>
<P N="67">67. <HI>Olearius</HI> in his <HI>Itinerary</HI> tells us of whole heards of such, call'd <HI>Ahu</HI> deer, he saw in the Province of <HI>Mokan</HI> in <HI>Persia,</HI> whose heads had no <HI>brow-Antlers,</HI> but were smooth to the top like ours, only that they bent backwards like the horns of a <HI>Goat</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Voyages of Adam Olearius Book <HI>5.</HI></NOTE>; which (beside the unlikelyhood that this should be brought thence) is enough to shew that it cannot be referr'd to that <HI>species</HI> of <HI>deer:</HI> though no body knows whence this came, it being taken alive by the <HI>Colliers</HI> in an old <HI>Coal-work,</HI> and brought to the <HI>Castle</HI> bound in a Wheel-barrow. Contrary to these I met with some other

Before the <HI>birth</HI> of <HI>Children,</HI> so powerfull is the <HI>Pica</HI> or <HI>Longing</HI> of a <HI>Woman,</HI> that in case she be not presently supplyed with the <HI>object</HI> of her unreasonable extravagant <HI>appetite,</HI> she fre∣quently <HI>marks</HI> her <HI>child</HI> with some resemblance of it: whereof we daily see so many <HI>examples,</HI> that it would be impertinent <HI>here</HI> to instance in any. But the <HI>marks</HI> she sometimes gives her <HI>child</HI> up∣on a <HI>fright,</HI> are so very observable, that they must not be pass't over; these being many times more than Skin deep: as I noted it in a <HI>Gentlewoman</HI> I once saw at <HI>London</HI> that had the <HI>figure</HI> of a <HI>Mouse</HI> on her <HI>cheek</HI> standing fourth protuberant <HI>in mezzo rilievo</HI> with the furr on, given her by her mother upon a <HI>fright</HI> she re∣ceived from that <HI>Animal,</HI> whil'st she went with child of her. Nay so strong impressions doe such <HI>frights</HI> sometimes make upon <HI>wo∣men;</HI> that they will break the very Skins of the <HI>Faetus</HI> in the <HI>Womb,</HI> as we read in the <HI>Transactions</HI> of a <HI>Souldiers</HI> wife that had seen some body sore wounded and disfigured, produced a <HI>child</HI> wound∣ed after the same manner, pieces of flesh in the shape of <HI>Pistol∣bullets</HI> hanging to its body, &amp;c. as it is there represented <HI>Fig.</HI> 13<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Philosoph.

<P N="5"><PB N="270" REF="185"/>5. But I never met with an instance in all my <HI>Travells</HI> where any of these <HI>impressions</HI> were so very strong that they dismember'd the <HI>Faetus</HI> in the same part the object was, which gave the fright, till I came to <HI>Leek,</HI> where <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the wife of <HI>Jeremiah Tomkin∣son</HI> having heard that one <HI>John Heath</HI> a <HI>Black-Smith</HI> who lived in her house, upon reading that of S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Matthew Chap.</HI> 5. v. 30. <HI>[if they right hand offend thee, cut it off]</HI> had repaired to his bro∣thers house a <HI>Wood-man</HI> of <HI>Cunsall,</HI> and taken oportunity with one of his brothers <HI>instruments</HI> to cut off his <HI>right hand;</HI> was so affected with it, being then about the time of her <HI>conception</HI> (though she saw not the fact, nor heard of it till next day after it was done) that she brought forth a man child (whom I saw my self <HI>An.</HI> 1681) without a <HI>right hand,</HI> couped at the wrist much about the place where <HI>John Heath</HI> had cut his hand off. Which I take to be almost as strange an instance of the kind, as any of those mention'd by <HI>Bapt. Van Helmont:</HI> who tells us of a <HI>Tay∣lors</HI> wife of <HI>Mechlin</HI> who seeing a <HI>Souldier</HI> loose his hand in a conflict before her doore, was so terrifyed with it, that she pre∣sently was deliver'd of a <HI>daughter</HI> with one <HI>hand,</HI> the other be∣ing cut off, and the child bleeding to death of it. And that the wife of <HI>Mark de Vogeler</HI> a Merchant of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> in the year 1602 seeing a <HI>Souldier</HI> begging, who had his right Arm shot off by a bullet at the Seige of <HI>Ostend,</HI> which he carryed about with him bloody, I suppose to move pitty; was presently brought to bed of a <HI>daughter</HI> also without a <HI>right Arm,</HI> who was after marryed to one <HI>Hoochcamer</HI> a Merchant of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and was living in <HI>An.</HI> 1638<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joh.

<P N="6">6. Also before the <HI>birth</HI> of <HI>Children,</HI> so many and so apparent are the usual <HI>Symptoms</HI> commonly known by <HI>Women,</HI> about the time of <HI>conception;</HI> during their <HI>goeing</HI> with <HI>child;</HI> and when near their <HI>travel;</HI> that one would think a <HI>woman</HI> truly with <HI>child,</HI> could never be so mistaken, as I was told the wife of <HI>Samuel Ward</HI> of <HI>Mearton</HI> in this <HI>County</HI> really was: who after she had been marryed two years, was brought to bed of a <HI>daughter,</HI> both her self and <HI>husband,</HI> so little knowing, or so much as thinking she was ever with <HI>child,</HI> that growing ill near the time of her <HI>labour,</HI> they sent for a <HI>Physician</HI> instead of a <HI>Midwife.</HI> For one to have all these <HI>signes,</HI> and yet no <HI>child</HI> at last, is pretty common amongst <HI>women;</HI> nay so farr is it from a <HI>miracle</HI> that they are some∣times incident to <HI>ancient women</HI> past the age of child bearing, whereof M<SUP>rs</SUP>. <HI>Bromwich</HI> of the parish of <HI>Newland</HI> in the <HI>Forrest</HI> of <HI>Dean</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> who had all the Symptoms of a <HI>pregnant
<PB N="271" REF="185"/>woman</HI> at near 80 years of age, is a most remarkable instance<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Philosoph. Transact.

<P N="7">7. Amongst the <HI>unusual accidents</HI> in the <HI>birth</HI> of <HI>Man</HI> we must reckon the surprizing production of <HI>Monsters,</HI> whether in excess or defect; to the former of which the ancient <HI>Historians</HI> have usually referr'd such as are <HI>born</HI> with <HI>teeth,</HI> it having been al∣ways look't upon very extraordinary to be so born, <HI>children</HI> sel∣dom breeding them till the <HI>seventh month</HI> after their <HI>birth.</HI> Yet <HI>Sarab Wood</HI> of <HI>Brineton</HI> in the parish of <HI>Blymhill</HI> An. 1670. was thus born with two teeth, which was anciently accounted very unfortunate both to <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women,</HI> as in the instances of <HI>Vale∣ria,</HI> and our <HI>Richard</HI> the third King of <HI>England,</HI> who were both thus born, and one of them the cause of the ruin of <HI>Suessa Pometia</HI> a most flourishing <HI>City</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">C. Plinii <HI>2<SUP>l•</SUP>.</HI> Nat. Hist. Lib. <HI>7.</HI> cap. <HI>16.</HI></NOTE>, and the other of a no less flourishing <HI>Fa∣mily.</HI> But such observations as these I take to be more beholding to <HI>superstition</HI> than <HI>truth;</HI> for we find that <HI>M. Curius</HI> (upon this account surnamed <HI>Dentatus</HI>) and <HI>Cn. Papyrius Carbo</HI> to be both born with <HI>teeth,</HI> yet came to be very great men, and right hono∣rable personages<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8">8. More deservedly by much are the <HI>Monsters</HI> of defect, I have met with in this <HI>County,</HI> referr'd hither; such as that of <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> the wife of <HI>John Bird</HI> of <HI>Whittington</HI> near <HI>Lichfield,</HI> who <HI>An.</HI> 1679. was brought to bed of a <HI>child</HI> without upper lip, nose, or eyes; the hands turned upon the armes, and the feet upon the leggs, one of the heels extravagantly large, and a hole in the back without any backbone; it could not suck, but took milk and beer freely enough, whereby it lived 3 days, and then dyed. Which 'tis true was a birth imperfect and deformed enough, yet not near so much as that of the wife of one <HI>Taylor</HI> of <HI>great-Heywood,</HI> who in <HI>January</HI> 1684. as I received it in a Letter from my very good Friend M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Sampson Birch</HI> Alderman of <HI>Stafford,</HI> beside a a perfect <HI>still-born child,</HI> was deliver'd of another <HI>monstrous body,</HI> made up of a large <HI>Cystis</HI> or bagg about the thickness of a <HI>Mans Scrotum,</HI> smooth on the out side, and somewhat reddish, fill'd with a liquid slimy matter, but not fetid: in the upper part whereof was a round protuberant <HI>bone</HI> 3 inches and ½ in compass coverd with a thick fleshy Skin beset with short hairs, in which were placed 8 <HI>dentes molares</HI> in a circular form, having a small hole in the middle which led not farr: below these in another <HI>bone</HI> were placed 5 other teeth, also of the <HI>molar</HI> kind, four of
<PB N="272" REF="186"/>them almost in a straight line, and the fift a little below the two uppermost, which in shape, whiteness, &amp;c. all so well resembled <HI>teeth,</HI> that they could not be thought to be any thing else.</P>
<P N="9">9. Out of the Skin of the <HI>Cystis</HI> a little below the uppermost <HI>bone,</HI> in which the <HI>eight teeth</HI> are set, grew a large <HI>lock</HI> of <HI>hair</HI> of a bright brown colour, whose end was intricate and intangled in a larger quantity fastened in the other end of the <HI>Cystis</HI> opposite to the <HI>eight teeth</HI> of a more yellowish colour: all which may be con∣ceived well enough by the <HI>figure</HI> of it <HI>Tab.</HI> 25. where it is exactly graven in its just magnitude. Now for a just account of this <HI>Embryo</HI> or <HI>preternatural body</HI> though it cannot be expected, yet I think I may pronounce without any great diffidence, 1. that it must come from an <HI>Egg</HI> that descended from the <HI>Ovarium</HI> through the <HI>Tube</HI> to the <HI>womb,</HI> as well as that of the <HI>perfect child;</HI> 2. that <HI>Nature</HI> in this birth at first intended <HI>Twinns;</HI> and 3 that the <HI>bony</HI> and <HI>fleshy</HI> parts, out of which grew the <HI>hair,</HI> and the two setts of <HI>teeth,</HI> were some rudiments design'd to form a <HI>head:</HI> but how dame <HI>Na∣ture</HI> came thus to miscarry in her <HI>plastics,</HI> whether from some <HI>ex∣ternal violence</HI> which might break the <HI>Egg</HI> after it came into the <HI>womb?</HI> or whether the <HI>Egg</HI> it self at first was imperfect or subven∣taneous, out of which <HI>Nature</HI> being unable to form a perfect <HI>Faetus,</HI> made the best of what the matter could afford? as the learned D<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Tyson</HI> more probably thinks, who has written more at large of it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Philosoph. Transact. Numb. <HI>150.</HI></NOTE>; I shall not determin, but leave the <HI>Reader</HI> freely to use his owne judgment.</P>
<P N="10">10. Nor has it been usual only amongst the <HI>Natural Historians</HI> to transmit to posterity such <HI>imperfect births</HI> as these; but the most perfect ones too, when they have proved <HI>extraordinary:</HI> whence it is that the birth-places of <HI>Princes,</HI> and <HI>Men</HI> any way <HI>famous,</HI> either for <HI>Arts,</HI> or <HI>Arms;</HI> for <HI>Piety,</HI> or <HI>Munificence;</HI> have been constantly noted: and if by chance so neglected that they have become <HI>dubious;</HI> what contention has there been between <HI>Citys</HI> and <HI>Countries</HI> for the honor of the <HI>birth</HI> of a <HI>famous Man?</HI> Thus no less than <HI>seven Cities</HI> strove for the birth of <HI>Homer;</HI> and thus <HI>Middlesex</HI> and <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> contest the birth of <HI>Chaucer</HI> our famous English <HI>Poet</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See the Life of Chaucer by John Speght.</NOTE>; and here in <HI>Oxfordshire Ewelm</HI> and <HI>Wood-stock</HI> both pretend to him.

Then was read unto him the 12. <HI>verse</HI> of the said 1. <HI>Chap.</HI> of S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Johns</HI> Gospel [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c.] which he supposing to be the <HI>first verse,</HI> did accordingly as he was wont fall into one of his <HI>Agony's.</HI> Which being quickly over, next was read unto him in the same <HI>language</HI> the <HI>first verse</HI> being indeed the aforesaid <HI>Text</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c.] yet he suspecting it not the same <HI>Text,</HI> was not troubled at it<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="29">29. By this means was his <HI>fraud</HI> so far discover'd, that he was not a little confounded; however stareing still with his <HI>Eyes,</HI> and casting his <HI>head</HI> on both sides the <HI>bed</HI> whereon he lay, that he might cover his disimulation the better, he told the <HI>company</HI> he was troubled at the sight of two <HI>Mice:</HI> and that he might be freed from further <HI>tryal</HI> and sent home to his <HI>Father,</HI> he complained of extreme <HI>Sickness,</HI> and by writing, as well as he could, did sig∣nify that he had a great pain in his <HI>belly,</HI> and the morning fol∣lowing making <HI>water</HI> in a <HI>Ʋrinal,</HI> it was found as <HI>black</HI> as <HI>Ink,</HI> for there was some that <HI>wrot</HI> very legibly with it. Two days after he seemed to make <HI>water</HI> of the same <HI>colour</HI> again, which that he might the more craftily dissemble, he vehemently <HI>groaned</HI> at the making of it, whereupon one comeing into the <HI>room</HI> to him, the <HI>boy</HI> shewed him his manner of makeing water, whereof a lit∣tle remain came then from him of the same <HI>tincture,</HI> which he had purposely reserved within his <HI>praeputium,</HI> to make it seem as if it came so immediatly from him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="30">30. To find out this too, the <HI>Bishop</HI> ordered a trusty <HI>Servant</HI> to watch him through a <HI>hole</HI> that opened into the <HI>chamber</HI> towards the <HI>bed,</HI> which the <HI>boy</HI> knew not of; by whose diligent <HI>observation,</HI> the third day following he was espyed to take out an <HI>Ink-horn</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="192"/>which he had hid in the <HI>straw</HI> or <HI>Mat</HI> of his <HI>bed,</HI> and to make water in the <HI>Ʋrinal</HI> through a piece of the <HI>Cotton</HI> in his <HI>hand,</HI> nimb∣ly conveying the <HI>Ink-horn</HI> into the same place again: whereof as as soon as the <HI>Man</HI> had acquainted the <HI>Bishop,</HI> he came to him presently and askt him how he did? who according to his usuall manner pointed to his <HI>water</HI> looking ghastly at it; then the <HI>Bishop</HI> who now meant to deal roundly with him, told him plainly that he knew he had <HI>Ink</HI> in his <HI>bed-straw,</HI> with which he used to <HI>black</HI> his <HI>water,</HI> and calling in his <HI>Man</HI> took the <HI>Ink-horn</HI> out of the place where he had hid it, the <HI>Man</HI> justifying at the same time that he saw him make water through the <HI>Cotton.</HI> Which (with the <HI>Bishops</HI> threatening to send him to the house of <HI>Correction</HI>) struck him with such a terrour that he rose from his bed, fell upon his knees, and burst out into plentifull tears, <HI>confessing</HI> all to his own <HI>shame</HI> and <HI>Gods</HI> glory, not only what the <HI>old Man</HI> had taught him, but also what he had contrived of himself<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Wilson's Hist. of the life and reign of K.

<P N="31">31.

After which sincere <HI>confession</HI> and <HI>acknowledgment,</HI> he continued at <HI>Eccleshall Castle,</HI> till he was recover'd of his <HI>weakness,</HI> and was finally brought again to the following <HI>Summer Assize</HI> held at <HI>Stafford Jul.</HI> 26. <HI>An.</HI> 1621. before S<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Peter Warburton</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Humphry Winch</HI> Knights, his Majesties <HI>Justices</HI> of <HI>Assize,</HI> and the face of the whole <HI>Country</HI> there assembled: where he first craved pardon of <HI>almighty God;</HI> then desired the <HI>poore woman</HI> there also present to forgive him; and lastly requested the whole <HI>Country,</HI> whom he had so notoriously and wickedly scandalized, to admit of that

<P N="32">32. The strange facility and readiness wherewith this <HI>boy</HI> of <HI>Bilson</HI> in a little time could personate all the <HI>gestures</HI> of one <HI>be∣witch't</HI> or <HI>possest,</HI> puts me in mind with what impulses or peculia∣rities of temper some are inclined (especially in their <HI>youth</HI>) to imitate <HI>motions</HI> and <HI>sounds:</HI> for which <HI>Doterel</HI>-quality, I remem∣ber a young <HI>Scholar</HI> of <HI>Magd. Coll. Oxon.</HI> so very excellent, that he would personat a <HI>Changeling;</HI> counterfiet the <HI>barking</HI> of a <HI>Dogg;</HI> the grunting and squeeking of a <HI>Sow</HI> and <HI>piggs;</HI> and di∣vers other <HI>gestures</HI> and <HI>noises</HI> so very indistinguishably, that a <HI>Stranger,</HI> or any other person not privy to it, could not but think them the very same. So in <HI>Darby-shire</HI> I was shewn a <HI>Youth</HI> that could most exactly imitate a <HI>Hunters</HI> horn with his <HI>voice</HI> only. And I saw one <HI>William Creswell</HI> an Apprentice to <HI>Anthony Ban∣nister</HI> of <HI>Rugeley</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> who could <HI>whistle</HI> so artificially, that scarce any body out of sight, could distinguish his notes from those of a <HI>Flagelet.</HI> Which imitations being voluntary, at the pleasure of the <HI>Agent,</HI> perhaps may arise only from the frequent representations of the gestures and sounds their <HI>Parents</HI> or <HI>Nurses</HI> accustomed them to, during their <HI>infancy,</HI> which may possibly have so much influence (at these years) in molding the texture of the <HI>Brain</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> as to dispose them to the imitation, of such <HI>motions</HI> and <HI>notes,</HI> rather than others.</P>
<P N="33">33. But when this <HI>imitating quality</HI> is so very strong, that it becomes <HI>involuntary,</HI> as it is in <HI>Donald Monro</HI> of <HI>Scrachbogie</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who pulls of his hat, and puts it on; wipes his nose; wrings his hands; stretches forth his armes; and imitates all other actions he sees any man doe, though much against his will, with so much exactness and such a natural and unaffected an <HI>Air,</HI> that no man can suspect he does it with <HI>designe;</HI> and yet with so strong an <HI>impulse</HI> (as the Reverend and learned D<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Garden</HI> in∣forms us) that if his hands be held, he cannot forbeare pressing to get himself free to doe the same thing. Nay so contrary to his mind does he <HI>Ape</HI> these motions, that to hide his <HI>infirmity,</HI> he casts down his <HI>Eyes</HI> when he walks the <HI>streets,</HI> and turns them away when in <HI>company,</HI> wherein too 'tis hard to make him stay, once he finds himself observed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Philosoph. Tran∣sact. Numb. <HI>129.</HI></NOTE>. When I say this <HI>imitating quality</HI> is thus so very strong, that it becomes <HI>involuntary,</HI> the impressions given by <HI>parents</HI> or <HI>nurses</HI> seem not sufficient to ac∣count
<PB N="285" REF="193"/>for it, it being more probably grounded in some peculiar <HI>crasis</HI> in the <HI>Spirits,</HI> or <HI>distemper</HI> in the <HI>imagination,</HI> nothing less being adequat to such effects.</P>
<P N="34">34. After those of <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>youths,</HI> Method directs me next to consider the <HI>uncommon accidents</HI> that have at any time at∣tended more <HI>adult</HI> persons; and first of such as have befallen the <HI>female Sex,</HI> which according to the custom of <HI>England</HI> has al∣ways the place: amongst which I take it to be very extraordinary that I met with at <HI>little-Worley</HI> in the parish of <HI>Cannock,</HI> where I saw one <HI>Mary Eagle</HI> who could draw two quarts of milk from her breasts <HI>per diem,</HI> beside what her child suck't, where∣of she could have made (had there been vent for it) two pounds of <HI>butter per</HI> week, ever since she was brought to bed, which was about five <HI>Months</HI> past, when I was there. She gave me some of the <HI>butter,</HI> which was made up fresh, without <HI>Salt,</HI> it needing none (as she told me) to preserve it, which she sold to some <HI>Apothecaries</HI> hereabout at a good rate, it being usefull (as she said) in all sorts of <HI>swellings, Aches</HI> of the <HI>head,</HI> sore <HI>Eyes,</HI> &amp;c. but I believe it was so made only at their directions, for I found <HI>that</HI> she gave me, to grow rancid in a while, and to stink at last. <HI>Borellus</HI> in his observations tells us of much such another woman, one <HI>Mary Caron</HI> a Taylors wife of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> who could afford milk enough every day for the noursing two children, and to make <HI>butter</HI> beside; which she also did, at the earnest request of a certain <HI>Apothecary,</HI> who used it, not against <HI>swellings,</HI> &amp;c. as here in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> but as a great <HI>nostrum</HI> or <HI>secret</HI> against <HI>Consumptions,</HI> for which he thought it the best <HI>remedy</HI> of any whatever<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Petr. Borelli Histor. &amp; Observ. Medice-Phys. Ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. <HI>3.</HI> Obs. <HI>82.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="35">35. Amongst such <HI>accidents</HI> as these, we may also reckon what befell one <HI>Mary Foster</HI> of <HI>Admaston,</HI> now the wife of <HI>John Stone</HI> of <HI>Burton</HI> upon <HI>Trent,</HI> who casually falling into a well was so frighted with it, that for about a fortnight she rested but little, but at length fell into so sound a sleep that she wakened not again in 14 days and nights. About two years after she went to live at <HI>Ʋttoxater,</HI> where she slept again (as I was inform'd) three days and nights more: but she her self told me it was but two nights and a day. Now though it may seem a little odd that such dreadfull impressions which one would think at first sight should rather keep one <HI>waking,</HI> should cast a person into so profound a <HI>sleep;</HI> yet upon further consideration that nothing disorders and tires the <HI>Spirits</HI> more than sudden <HI>frights</HI> and <HI>anxieties</HI> of mind, me thinks it should not seem any great wonder, if to recruit themselves again, they incline to <HI>rest,</HI> and dispose the person to
<PB N="286" REF="194"/><HI>sleep</HI> a longer or shorter time, in proportion to the expence and disturbance they have had.</P>
<P N="36">36. Which in all probability was also the case of a little girle about 8 years old mention'd by <HI>Dan. Ludovicus,</HI> who being first beaten by a sever <HI>stepmother,</HI> and then sent <HI>hungry</HI> with a bever to her <HI>Father</HI> in the field who was a poor <HI>herdsman,</HI> and not for∣bearing to eat part of it; when she saw it half gone, fearing more stripes, went no further on her way but turned aside into the next grove or wood, where full of tears and sobbs, she layd her self down covering her face on all sides with leaves and moss, and at last fell into so deep a sleep, that she waked not again in seven days: nor is it likely she had then, had she not been found by some <HI>boys,</HI> that went thither to set <HI>snares</HI> for <HI>birds,</HI> who disco∣vered her to her <HI>parents,</HI> by whom being carryed to the next house as dead (without any <HI>symptoms</HI> of life beside the softness of her flesh, and flexibility of her joynts) where <HI>Ludovicus</HI> by chance was in company with a friend: having first wash't from her face a glutinous flegme mixt with the moss and leaves that had cover'd it, with hot water; and cleared her mouth and nostrills from a viscid substance that had stopt them; he then gave her a spoonfull of <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Wine,</HI> which seeming to pass, upon giving her another she began to <HI>groan,</HI> and after a third she open'd her <HI>Eyes,</HI> and so came at length to her self by degrees<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P N="47">47. Yet these <HI>Slept</HI> not so long, but there are others in this <HI>County</HI> that have <HI>fasted</HI> as wonderfully; one <HI>William Francis</HI> of <HI>Fisherwick</HI> being Melancholy-mad, having once willfully fasted 14 days together, notwithstanding all means used to force him to eat. Which yet was nothing to what was also willfully done by one <HI>John Scot</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> who being cast in a suit of Law, and knowing himself insolvent, took <HI>Sanctuary</HI> in the Abbey of <HI>Hali∣rudhouse,</HI> where out of a deep discontent, he abstained from all <HI>meat</HI> and <HI>drink</HI> 30 or 40 days together. Publick rumor bring∣ing this abroad, the <HI>King</HI> himself resolved to have it put to tryal, whereupon he was shut up in a private room in the <HI>Castle</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> whereunto no man had access, and had a little <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>water</HI> set by him, which he was found not to have tasted, in 32 days.

<P N="39">39. These 'tis true are as eminent <HI>Instances</HI> in their kind, and the truth of them back't with as good <HI>Authorities,</HI> as one could expect or desire: and yet neither of them much exceed the <HI>per∣petuall fast</HI> (as I may call it) of one <HI>Mary Vaughton</HI> of <HI>Wigginton</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> who from her cradle to this day has lived with so small a quantity both of <HI>meats</HI> and <HI>drinks,</HI> that all people ad∣mire how nature is thus sustained without any sensible exhaustion; she not eating in a day a piece above the size of half a Crown in <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>butter;</HI> or if <HI>meat,</HI> not above the quantity of a <HI>pidgeons</HI> legg at most: she drinks neither <HI>wine, ale,</HI> or <HI>beer;</HI> but only <HI>water,</HI> or <HI>milk,</HI> or both mixt; and of either of these scarce a

<P N="40">40 Now to give a satisfactory reason of the long <HI>abstinence</HI> of these <HI>persons,</HI> who have lived thus with little, or no food at all; or to pronounce how it comes to pass that <HI>death,</HI> or at lest a signal <HI>Marasmus</HI> or destructive consumption has not insued; though I dare not pretend: yet I cannot for bear so far to gratify the <HI>Rea∣der,</HI> as to let him know, that I think the case to be no otherwise with these, than 'tis with <HI>Leeches, Lizards, Snailes,</HI> and the <HI>Tor∣toises, Porcupines,</HI> and <HI>Toads,</HI> abovementioned<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chap.</HI> 7. §. 46.</NOTE>: in all which the <HI>natural heat</HI> and <HI>moisture</HI> is either so justly counterpoised; or else their <HI>viscid juices</HI> do so overbalance and restrain the <HI>acti∣vity</HI> of their <HI>heat,</HI> that it is unable to rarify, or seperate the parts of their <HI>moisture;</HI> whence there cannot follow any <HI>perspiration</HI> or <HI>consumption;</HI> and so no need of <HI>reparation</HI> by <HI>meats</HI> or <HI>drinks:</HI> upon which account some of them have lived divers months, and others half a year together without any visible supply.

<P N="41">41. But I have more wonderfull passages relating to <HI>Women,</HI> than any of these yet to declare, whereof the first and strangest is of one <HI>Mary Woodward</HI> of <HI>Hardwick</HI> in the parish of <HI>Sandon,</HI> who loosing her hearing at about 6 years of age, by her extraordinary ingenuity and strickt observation of the peoples <HI>lipps</HI> that convers't with her, could perfectly understand what any person said, though they spake so low that the <HI>by standers</HI> could not hear it: as has been frequently experimented by the right Honorable the Lady <HI>Gerard,</HI> and divers others of her <HI>neighbours</HI> now living, with whom she would goe to <HI>Church,</HI> and bring away as much of the <HI>Sermon</HI> as the most attentive <HI>hearer</HI> there: all which she did, not with difficulty, but so much ease and satisfaction, that if one turned aside and spake, that she could not see his <HI>lipps,</HI> she thought her self much disobliged. Nay so very well skill'd was she in this <HI>Art</HI> (which we may call <HI>Labiomancy</HI>) as 'tis generally beleived (though I could get no personall testimony of it, some persons be∣ing
<PB N="289" REF="195"/>dead, and others removed into <HI>Ireland</HI> who sometimes lay with her) that in the night time when in <HI>bed,</HI> if she might lay but her hand on their <HI>lipps</HI> so as to feel the motions of them, she could perfectly understand what her <HI>bedfellows</HI> said, though it were never so dark.</P>
<P N="42">42. For confirmation of the possibility and truth whereof, there are many parallel <HI>Histories</HI> sent us from abroad, of <HI>persons</HI> that have done the same in all particulars: of which <HI>Borellus</HI> affords us one, of a certain Sea-man of <HI>Xantoigne</HI> who lost his hearing at 5 years old, by the violence of a distemper, that was supplyed by nature with so admirable a <HI>Sagacity,</HI> that he could apprehend what was spoken with the lowest voice, by the motion of the <HI>lipps</HI> only, though no <HI>sound</HI> were made, and give an answer accordingly: tryal whereof was made by <HI>Isaac Tho. de Riolet</HI> a learned <HI>Physitian</HI> of that <HI>Country</HI> who held discourse with him at 25 foot distance, with a voice so low, that he could not hear himself speak.

<P N="44">44. Nor is it much less a wonder that I am now about to re∣late of Madam <HI>Skrymsher</HI> of <HI>Aqualat,</HI> a Lady of much honor and virtue, who having felt for some time a <HI>pricking</HI> in her <HI>Arm,</HI> upon her frequent complaint to her tender husband, who pertook of the greif, and was officious to remove it, upon squeesing her <HI>Arm</HI> he forced thence from about the <HI>Basilical</HI> vein, first a <HI>pins</HI> point, then a good part of it appearing, he firmly took hold of it with a pair of <HI>Cissers,</HI> and immediatly drew it forth all but the <HI>head,</HI> which came off, and remaining behind in the skin, was there sensible to the touch for some time after.

<P N="46">46. Amongst the <HI>unusual accidents</HI> that have attended the fe∣mal Sex in the course of their lives, I think I may also reckon the narrow <HI>escapes</HI> they have made from <HI>death.</HI> Whereof I met
<PB N="291" REF="196"/>with one mention'd with admiration by every body at <HI>Leek,</HI> that happen'd not far off at the <HI>black Meer</HI> of <HI>Morridg,</HI> which though famous for nothing for which it is commonly reputed so, as that it is bottomless; no Cattle will drink of it; or birds fly over or settle upon it (all which I found false) yet is so, for the signal deliverance of a poor woman, inticed hither in a dismall stormy night by a bloody <HI>Ruffin,</HI> who had first gotten her with child, and intended in this remote inhospitable place, to have dispatch't her by drowning. The same night (<HI>Providence</HI> so or∣dering it) there were several persons of inferior rank drinking in an <HI>Ale-house</HI> at <HI>Leek</HI> whereof one having been out, and observ∣ing the darkness and other ill circumstances of the weather, com∣ing in again said to the rest of his <HI>Companions,</HI> that he were a stout man indeed that would venture to goe to the <HI>black Meer</HI> of <HI>Mor∣ridg</HI> in such a night as that; to which one of them replying, that for a <HI>Crown</HI> or some such Summe he would undertake it; the rest joyning their purses said he should have his demand. The bar∣gain being struck, away he went on his journey with a stick in his hand, which he was to leave there as a testimony of his perfor∣mance; at length comeing near the <HI>Meer,</HI> he heard the lamentable cryes of this distressed <HI>woman,</HI> begging for mercy; which at first put him to a stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but being a man of great resolution and some policy, he went boldly on however, counterfeiting the presence of divers other <HI>persons,</HI> calling <HI>Jack, Dick,</HI> and <HI>Thom,</HI> and crying <HI>here are the rogues we look't for,</HI> &amp;c. which being heard by the <HI>Murderer</HI> he left the <HI>Woman</HI> and fled, whom the other man found by the <HI>Meer</HI> side almost stript of her cloaths, and brought her with him to <HI>Leek,</HI> as an ample testimony of his having been at the <HI>Meer,</HI> and of Gods providence too.</P>
<P N="47">47.

<P>How unwillingly the cold viscid juices part with the sensitive soule, appear'd, I say, most strangely in this case: unless we shall rather say she could not be hanged, upon account that the <HI>Larynx</HI> or upper part of her <HI>Wind-pipe</HI> was turned to <HI>bone,</HI> as <HI>Fal∣lopius</HI> tells us he has sometimes found it<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Gab. Fallopii oper Tom. <HI>1.</HI> Observ. Anatom. Tract. <HI>6.</HI></NOTE>, which possibly might be so strong, that the weight of her body could not compress it, as it happened in the case of a <HI>Swiss,</HI> who as I am told by the Reve∣rend M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Obadiah Walker</HI> Master of <HI>Ʋniversity College,</HI> was at∣tempted to be hanged no less than 13 times, yet lived notwith∣standing, by the benefit of his <HI>Wind-pipe,</HI> that after his death was found to be turned to a <HI>bone:</HI> which yet is still wonderfull, since the <HI>circulation</HI> of the <HI>blood</HI> must be stopt however, unless his <HI>veins</HI> and <HI>arteries</HI> were likewise turned to <HI>bone,</HI> or the <HI>rope</HI> not slipt close.</P>
<P N="48">48. Thus having done with the <HI>Women</HI> solitarily considered, I shall next treat of the <HI>Men</HI> and the accidents that have attend∣ed them during the course of their lives in the like manner. And first of the extraordinary <HI>perfections</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> whether of body or
<PB N="293" REF="197"/>mind, and then of their <HI>defects.</HI> As for the <HI>perfections</HI> of the <HI>body,</HI> I take that of <HI>strength</HI> to be one of the cheifest; wherein I met with some that excell'd so much, that unless I had seen the things done my self, I should have though them incredible: par∣ticularly that of one <HI>Godfrey Witrings</HI> a butcher of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> whome I saw take a forme, at <HI>Robert Launders</HI> in the Lane, 6 foot 10 inches long, and 56 pounds weight, by one end in his <HI>teeth</HI> (holding his hands behind him, and bearing the leggs of that end next him against his brest) and lift the other end the whole height of the parlour, striking it 3 times against the boards of the room above. Now supposeing the leggs to stand about 10 inches from the end of the <HI>form,</HI> towards the middle, or <HI>center</HI> of <HI>gravi∣ty,</HI> which is near of the distance betwixt the end and the <HI>Center;</HI> by computation he lifted thus with his <HI>teeth</HI> about 168 pounds weight. Which is not so much as what was done by a Juglar <HI>Car∣dan</HI> tells us of, who took up the <HI>mast</HI> of a small boat with his <HI>teeth,</HI> and threw it first upon one shoulder, whence he removed it to the other, without touching it with his hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hieron. Cardani. de Subtilitate Iab. <HI>11.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="49">49. Nor so much as was performed by one <HI>Nicholas Cooper</HI> of <HI>Acton-Trussel,</HI> who was also a man of so extraordinary strength in those parts, that he could lift a sack of <HI>wheat</HI> of 4 strike with his <HI>teeth;</HI> which accounting but 50 pounds to the <HI>strike</HI> (than which searce any weighs less) amounts to 200 pounds weight, but reckoning at 60 pounds <HI>per bushell</HI> (as some <HI>wheat</HI> weighs) he lifted 240. But this was not the utmost he could doe neither, for once upon a <HI>wager,</HI> he took up a man, by a coard tyed round him, of 300 weight, and set him on a <HI>Table.</HI> Nor was he strong in his <HI>teeth</HI> only but in the whole frame of his body, having taken up at a time 3 sizeable men, one under each <HI>Arm,</HI> and a third in his <HI>teeth.</HI> Which is not much less than that mention'd by <HI>Cardan,</HI> who saw a man dance with two under his armes, as many upon his shoulders, and one hanging about his neck<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>. And formerly being desired to give a <HI>specimen</HI> of his strength, he set his back under the <HI>Axle-tree</HI> of a <HI>Cart</HI> laden with 3 horsload and ½ of <HI>coals,</HI> and not only lifted it <HI>wheels</HI> and all, but turned it quite round. The same person having a <HI>Lesow</HI> quite overrun with well grown <HI>broom,</HI> near a mans height; whereas others are forced to stock or root up such broom with <HI>Matocks</HI> and other <HI>instru∣ments;</HI> he pluck't up all <HI>his</HI> by the <HI>roots</HI> with his hands, though the ground was 4 <HI>Acres.</HI> To whom let me add that one <HI>Thomas Wall</HI> of <HI>Wolver hampton</HI> was once so strong in his <HI>teeth,</HI> that he could readily bend a large <HI>nail</HI> or <HI>tenterbook,</HI> and set it straight
<PB N="294" REF="198"/>again with them: for the better performance whereof I was told his <HI>teeth</HI> were <HI>molares</HI> before, instead of <HI>incisores;</HI> but upon exa∣mination I found them not so, only indeed his <HI>incisores</HI> were of an unusual thickness.</P>
<P N="50">50. Not at all inferior to any of these in matters of <HI>strength,</HI> was one <HI>Walter Parsons</HI> of <HI>West-Bromwich</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> though <HI>his</HI> was not so much to be admired as <HI>theirs,</HI> who were Men but of a middleing ordinary size, whereas <HI>Parsons</HI> had a stature pro∣portionable to his strength; being so very tall when he was a young <HI>apprentice,</HI> that they were forced to digg a hole in the ground for him to stand in up to his knees, when he struck at the <HI>Anvil</HI> (for he was first a <HI>Black-Smith</HI>) or sawed wood with ano∣ther, that he might be at a <HI>Level</HI> with his <HI>fellow-workman.</HI> At length he became <HI>Porter</HI> to King <HI>James</HI> the first, where he behaved himself so generously, that though he had valour equal to his strength, yet he scorned to take advantage to injure any person by it; upon which account we have but few <HI>experiments</HI> left us of his great <HI>strength,</HI> but such as were sportive: as that being af∣fronted by a man of ordinary stature, as he walkt <HI>London</HI> streets, he only took him up by the wastband of his breeches, and hung him upon one of the hooks in the <HI>shambles,</HI> to be ridicul'd by the people, and so went his way: and that sometimes by way of merryment, he would take two of the tallest <HI>Yeomen</HI> of the <HI>Guard</HI> (like the <HI>Gizard</HI> and <HI>Liver</HI>) under his <HI>Arms,</HI> and carry them as he pleased (in spight of all resistance) about the <HI>Guard Chamber:</HI> where (if I am not misinformed) <HI>that</HI> is his <HI>picture</HI> which hangs at the end next the stairs, leading down into the Court toward <HI>White-Hall</HI> Gate.</P>
<P N="51">51. There is another <HI>picture</HI> of him, as I have been told also by some, in the great room at the <HI>Popes-head</HI> Tavern, in <HI>Popes-head</HI> Alley: but whether they are the true <HI>pictures</HI> of him or noe, it being uncertain that they were drawn in the just proportion, I took not the pains to have them measur'd; chusing rather to col∣lect what his height might be, from a true measure of his hand yet remaining upon a piece of Wainscot at <HI>Bentley-Hall:</HI> by which it appeare that from the <HI>Carpus</HI> to the end of the <HI>middle finger,</HI> it was eleven inches long, and the <HI>palm</HI> 6 inches broad: which (abate∣ments being made interchangeably) is much about the size of the hand of <HI>Edmund Malloon</HI> a youth of 19 years old, born at <HI>Port-Leicester</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for his extraordinary stature shewn publickly here in <HI>Oxford</HI> in 1684, which though from the <HI>Carpus</HI> to the end of the <HI>middle finger</HI> it were 12 inches long, yet the <HI>palm</HI> was no more than five inches broad. i. e. it sell as much short of <HI>Par∣sons</HI>'s hand in the bredth, as it exceeded it in length.</P>
<P N="52"><PB N="295" REF="198"/>52. Now the proportion of the stature of <HI>Edmund Malloon</HI> to this hand, being as 7 and ½ to 1. that is being 7 foot 6 inches high, thence we may rationally conclude that <HI>Parsons</HI> must also be thereabout; both much about the height of <HI>John Tates</HI> born at <HI>Schoonhoven</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> the length of whose <HI>Cubit</HI> (as M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Ray</HI> tells us) was 25 inches and ½ the length of his <HI>hand</HI> to the <HI>wrist</HI> 11 inches, and his <HI>middle finger</HI> 7 inches<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Mr. Ray's Observations Topograph, &amp;c. p. <HI>6.</HI></NOTE> All short of the stature of <HI>Martin Wierwski</HI> a <HI>Polander</HI> who at the age of 42 years being presented to the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> the second as a rarity of nature, was found full eight foot high<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Dr. Brownes Travels through Ger∣many. p. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> And so was one of the <HI>Someries;</HI> Baron (and Founder of the Priory) of <HI>Dudley;</HI> if we may believe either his <HI>Statue,</HI> or <HI>hollow</HI> of the stone chest in which his body lay, both which as M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Erdeswick</HI> testifies measur∣ed 8 foot, than which had the body been any thing shorter, it could not with conveniency have been laid there<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Mr. Sampson Erdeswick's view of Staffordshire in Dudley Casta.</NOTE> considering how they anciently cut their stone coffins.

<P N="53">53. As for the <HI>perfections</HI> of the <HI>mind,</HI> cheifly shewn by good works, though so much in our own choise, they are as rarely ac∣quired to any great <HI>eminence,</HI> as those of the <HI>body</HI> are given; yet some evidences there have been too of such as these, as well here as elsewhere: in the relation whereof, I shall decline the foun∣dations of <HI>Religious houses, Hospitals,</HI> and <HI>Scholes,</HI> these having been the <HI>subjects</HI> of other pens; and apply my self only to such as have been omitted by others, <HI>viz.</HI> the founding or rebuild∣ing of <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Chappels,</HI> which have been so seldom done by private hands, that the contrary to it has grown to a <HI>Proverb.</HI> There have been some notwithstanding in all ages (not excepting our owne) whome God hath raised up for these purposes, whereof the first that I find any memorial of, is one <HI>David Kenric</HI> born at <HI>Ashley</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> a Souldier under <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the black-Prince who notwithstanding the little piety that attends the <HI>Camp,</HI> was the Founder or rebuilder of this <HI>Church,</HI> where there remains to this day a <HI>Statue</HI> of him to the shoulders, and against the wall within such a <HI>border</HI> as are commonly put

After the <HI>perfections</HI> of the bodies and minds of men, <HI>Logic</HI> directs me next to treat of the <HI>imperfections</HI> of both: and first a∣mongst those of the <HI>body,</HI> I think none more deplorable than the <HI>want</HI> of <HI>sight;</HI> which yet by the wonderfull sagacity of some that want it, is so strangely supplyed; that as some abovemen∣tion'd have learned to <HI>hear</HI> with their <HI>Eyes,</HI> so others in like manner by their exquisit <HI>touch,</HI> and nice <HI>hearing,</HI> have taught themselves to <HI>see</HI> with their <HI>hands</HI> and <HI>ears.</HI> By which means it is that <HI>Edward Ingram</HI> of <HI>Heath-hill</HI> in the parish of <HI>Sherriff-Hales,</HI> though he has been blind from the fourth or fift year of his age, can yet goe to <HI>Church</HI> by himself, and all about the <HI>Country;</HI> he can also mend <HI>shooes;</HI> and glase <HI>windows;</HI> make his own <HI>shirts;</HI> and most sorts of <HI>Joyners</HI> work; lays <HI>floores,</HI> &amp;c. and does almost any kind of <HI>handy-Work;</HI> and all only by the help of his <HI>Ears</HI> and <HI>hands.</HI></P>
<P N="61">61. Thus as I am credibly inform'd by the ingenious <HI>Joseph Brown</HI> of <HI>Woodchester</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> (the excellent <HI>Graver</HI> of the <HI>Map</HI> of this <HI>County</HI>) one <HI>Richard Clutterbuck</HI> of <HI>Rodborough</HI> a neighbour of his, though perfectly blind, hath so very curious an <HI>Ear,</HI> and <HI>hand;</HI> that he can hear the sine <HI>Sand</HI> of an hour∣glass <HI>fall,</HI> by which means he can make a most accurat judgment of many actions and things: and so exquisit is his <HI>feeling,</HI> that (like <HI>Martin Catelyn</HI> mention'd by <HI>Guicciardin</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lud.

<P N="62">62. To the <HI>imperfections</HI> of the <HI>body,</HI> the unusual distempers and diseases of it, must also be referr'd; and such no doubt on't I may reckon a strange <HI>Boulimy</HI> or rather <HI>Pica,</HI> that seized one <HI>Brian Careswell</HI> of the parish of <HI>Forton,</HI> who would knaw and eat both <HI>Linnen</HI> and <HI>Woollen:</HI> nay to that height of a <HI>habit.</HI> (or what else I may call it) was he brought at length in this matter, that he would eat <HI>ropes,</HI> and the very <HI>blankets</HI> of the bed whereon he lay; and this not only <HI>waking,</HI> but the <HI>sheets,</HI> and his <HI>shirt</HI> from his back as he <HI>slept.</HI> That a <HI>woman</HI> should have long'd to have done such things as these, had not been so extraordinary, it be∣ing usual for them in that condition to desire unreasonable things; such as to suck the <HI>wind</HI> out of <HI>bellows;</HI> to hear the crackleing of <HI>Cinders</HI> under their feet<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ph. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. <HI>29.</HI></NOTE>; and (as <HI>Borellus</HI> tells us one did) to eat <HI>human Excrements</HI> dryed and pouder'd<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Petr.

However this alone will serve to shew us, that these <HI>distempers</HI> doe not always (as some have thought) arise from ma∣lignant vapors of the <HI>Ʋterus</HI> only, which thus mislead the <HI>fancy;</HI> but sometimes also from a depravation of the <HI>menstruum</HI> of the <HI>Stomack,</HI> which may infect the <HI>brain</HI> as well, and occasion the like inordinat appetite.</P>
<P N="63">63. It may also be reckon'd amongst the <HI>uncommon distempers,</HI> that one <HI>George Holden</HI> a butcher of <HI>Walsall</HI> was long sick of a periodical <HI>Asthma,</HI> which constantly came upon him once in 14 or 20 days at most; of which at last dyeing, and his body being open'd, yet all his <HI>Viscera</HI> (the <HI>Lungs</HI> especially) were found well and sound, there being no signes left either of <HI>Phlegme</HI> or <HI>viscous humor</HI> that had ever affected them; or of any stagnation of the <HI>blood</HI> in the veins; nor was there any thing met with unu∣sual in him (as the learned D<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Needham</HI> informed D<SUP>r.</SUP> <HI>Willis</HI>) but that many stones were found in his <HI>Gall-Bladder</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Willisii de morbis convulsiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> cap. <HI>12.</HI></NOTE> Not that these learned Men did think the <HI>dyspnaea</HI> or disease of the person, was to be ascribed to these <HI>stones,</HI> but to a convulsion of <HI>Nerves</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="204"/>about the <HI>Lungs,</HI> or amongst the <HI>Muscles</HI> subservient to <HI>breathing,</HI> which possibly might arise either from severe <HI>vellications</HI> in the <HI>In∣testines</HI> by sharp humors; ill separation of the <HI>nervous juice</HI> in the <HI>brain;</HI> or obstruction of them in the <HI>nerves</HI> themselves; either of which might cause such a convulsive cough, without any affection of the <HI>lungs</HI> at all.</P>
<P N="64">64. It may also not unreasonably be accounted a <HI>distemper</HI> (provided it be not an effect of <HI>temperance</HI>) that some men have not the usual quantity of <HI>spittle,</HI> that others have; it being so necessary a concurrent at lest, for the performance of <HI>concoction:</HI> which how it is performed in those that have <HI>none,</HI> perhaps may not be unworthy our consideration. Now that there are such, I can instance in one <HI>James Plimmer,</HI> well known at <HI>Roucester,</HI> who though a great <HI>Tobacconist,</HI> never <HI>spits</HI> in the smoking of ten pipes together, nay some people told me that he never did spit though he smok't never so many, and I spake with a <HI>Nephew</HI> of his, that lives in the same house with him, who told me he never saw him <HI>spit</HI> in his life. I am also credibly informed of one <HI>Ricarby</HI> of <HI>Cokermouth</HI> in the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Cumberland</HI> a great smoker, &amp;c. that never <HI>spit</HI> in his life. And <HI>Borellus</HI> tells us of a certain <HI>Phy∣sician</HI> his familiar acquaintance, though fat and phlegmatic, that never either <HI>spit</HI> or vented <HI>mucus</HI> at the nose, yet enjoyed not∣withstanding perfect health; nor was he ever very <HI>thirsty,</HI> which made <HI>Borellus</HI> conjecture, that these <HI>excrements</HI> being obstructed in the <HI>nose,</HI> &amp;c. were swallowed down the <HI>throat,</HI> and so bedew∣ed the <HI>Larynx,</HI> that there was little or no need of any other <HI>be∣verage</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Petr.

<P N="65">65. Which I believe in great measure may also be true, of most, if not all of those that don't <HI>spit:</HI> for though it be certain what <HI>Hippocrates</HI> asserts, <HI>viz.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. i. e. that <HI>mucus</HI> and <HI>Saliva</HI> be <HI>repletionis indices</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hippocrat.

Though (I say) there may be many that doe not <HI>spit,</HI> upon account of their <HI>temperance,</HI> yet I doe not believe there are any men so wholy free from <HI>spiting;</HI> but they
<PB N="303" REF="204"/>have enough to suffice for moistening the <HI>Larynx;</HI> for mixing with their <HI>food;</HI> and assisting <HI>digestion;</HI> though they have no <HI>superfluity</HI> to throw off in <HI>spitle,</HI> as those who live plentifully commonly doe.</P>
<P N="66">66. Next the imperfections of the <HI>body,</HI> follow those of the <HI>mind;</HI> which are so much greater as the <HI>Soule</HI> is more noble than the <HI>body:</HI> those who are void of <HI>understanding</HI> being more helpless and miserable; than such as are either <HI>lame, deaf,</HI> or <HI>blind.</HI> Yet even these sometimes have such natural <HI>assistances,</HI> that they can performe things scarce attainable by the quickest parts or most solid understandings. Whereof D<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Willis</HI> gives us a most re∣markable <HI>instance,</HI> of a certain <HI>Foole</HI> who having been long used to repeat the <HI>strokes</HI> of a <HI>Clock</HI> near which he lived with a loud voice; comeing after to live where there was none, yet retained so strong <HI>impressions</HI> of it, that he could exactly distinguish the <HI>horary distances,</HI> and would personate so many <HI>strokes</HI> of the <HI>Clock</HI> with a loud voice as oft as an hour past, successively increasing the <HI>number</HI> of each hour, according as the time required, from which he could not be diverted, by any sort of business they could set him about: being become in a manner a natural <HI>living</HI> Clock, so strongly had <HI>Custom</HI> wrought this upon him.</P>
<P N="67">67. Which <HI>impressions</HI> as the learned D<SUP>r</SUP>. imagins, were cheifly made upon his <HI>Animal spirits;</HI> which having been accustom'd to be excited at such <HI>stated</HI> times, were brought at length by long <HI>imitation,</HI> to distinguish those <HI>periods</HI> of their own accord<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">The.

Which is so great a wonder, that had I not received it from very <HI>sober hands,</HI> and of the best <HI>quality;</HI> I could no more have believed it, than I am now able to resolve the <HI>Reader,</HI> by what <HI>natural meanes</HI> it could possibly be done: only that in general it could not be performed by any thing that relyes upon the <HI>force</HI> of <HI>Custom;</HI> these <HI>Feasts</HI> being movable: and
<PB N="304" REF="205"/>that therefore it must be referr'd, to some other more remote un∣know <HI>impressions</HI> (unless he had been taught some easy rule for it) intimately and purely seated in the <HI>soule</HI> it self.</P>

After this he went and wrought with one <HI>Thomas Osborn</HI> a Joyner of <HI>Dudley</HI> about a fortnight, but his flesh begining to grow black at the <HI>wrists,</HI> within few days after he made the <HI>execration,</HI> and his whole body weak and feeble, he endeavour'd to return toward his acquaintance again: but finding himself in the way not able to goe further, he laid himself down in the barn at <HI>Purton,</HI> the seat of the right Worshipfull S<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Walter Wrottesly,</HI> where being found after two days and nights or thereabout, he was kept at the charge of the parish of <HI>Tettenhall,</HI> til the next monthley meet∣ing of the <HI>Justices</HI> of Peace, when it being found upon examina∣tion that the parish of <HI>Kings-Swinford</HI> was the last place of his a∣boad he was carryed thither, and committed to the care of one <HI>John Bennet</HI> of <HI>Wall-Heath-side</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mr. Illingworth's Narrative of this sad Judgment.</NOTE>. By this time his hands and leggs, being both deprived of all sense and motion, look't blackish and dyeing; a <HI>Circle</HI> as it were like a <HI>Ligature</HI> (as was observed by an ingenious neighbouring <HI>Gentleman</HI>) compassing each <HI>wrist</HI> and <HI>knee</HI> at the joynt; dividing the sound from the dying parts, and

Above the forementioned <HI>Circles</HI> the flesh at first both at his <HI>wrists</HI> and <HI>knees</HI> rose in great <HI>tumors</HI> or <HI>knots,</HI> which after a while began to break and run; the <HI>nourishing juice</HI> (designed by nature to have fed the <HI>lower</HI> parts) emptying it self by those cor∣rupted sores in a <HI>quitture</HI> or <HI>Sanies,</HI> so insupportably stinking that few of his <HI>visitants</HI> (though they were many thousands) could endure the room without some strong <HI>odoriferous defensative.</HI> Shortly after the <HI>flesh</HI> began to shrink from the <HI>bones</HI> at those pla∣ces where the putried matter came forth, many little <HI>wormes</HI> issu∣ing from the rotten flesh: but when the dead limbs were dropt off, the <HI>joynts</HI> and <HI>flesh</HI> above look't pretty well and healthy, seem∣ing free of the former <HI>mortification;</HI> the <HI>flesh</HI> indeed still being <HI>raw,</HI> but <HI>sweet;</HI> and so quick and sensible, that he complained grievously upon the lest touch: insomuch that many were induced to believe, that an easy <HI>cure</HI> might have been made of it; for the stinking icho∣rous humor was once quite gone; whereof the <HI>poore man</HI> himself was also perswaded; saying, <HI>that now the execration wherewith he had cursed himself was fully come to pass</HI> (<HI>in that his</HI> hands <HI>were</HI> rot∣ted <HI>off</HI>) <HI>he was perswaded now it would goe no further.</HI> But the <HI>poor creature</HI> wanting all assistances both of <HI>Art</HI> &amp; good <HI>Medicines,</HI> save what the application of the leaves of <HI>Mullein</HI> afforded, which were used by his <HI>Keeper</HI> to defend the raw parts; after some weeks there issued again the like thin stinking humor as before, so that his <HI>flesh</HI> began to wast and his <HI>spirits</HI> to fail, which soon put a period to his miserable life.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mr. Ja.

<P N="71">71. The wonderfull escapes of <HI>death</HI> that some men have made in this <HI>County</HI> must also be reckon'd amongst the <HI>remarkable acci∣dents</HI> that have attended them in the course of their lives. A∣mongst which it was a very fortunate one, that happen'd to <HI>John Dawe</HI> of <HI>Lapley</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> who as I was told upon the place, being a <HI>Souldier</HI> in the <HI>Garrison</HI> there for the <HI>King</HI> in the late <HI>Civil warr,</HI> and commanded out upon a <HI>Salley,</HI> or as a <HI>Scout,</HI> found a
<PB N="306" REF="206"/><HI>horshooe</HI> by the way which he stuck in his girdle so wonderfull hap∣pily, that in a <HI>skermish</HI> he fell into not long after, he received a shot just upon the <HI>horshooe,</HI> which had it not been there, in all probability he had lost his life: whereby he as evidently made good the Proverb, <HI>that a little</HI> Armour <HI>well placed is as good as a whole</HI> suit, as the <HI>Gentleman</HI> did in the unhappy expedition into the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Ree,</HI> who haveing but one <HI>Jacobus</HI> in his pocket, which luckily lay flat-ways against his belly, received a <HI>shot</HI> likewise just upon it, that bent it quite round, yet prevented any entrance in∣to his body, and so saved his life<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ja Howell's familiar historical Letters.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="72">72. Men have also been strangely preserved in the <HI>Coal-pits</HI> of this <HI>Country,</HI> whereof at <HI>Wednesbury</HI> I was told of two remarkable instances; one, of a <HI>Man</HI> of <HI>Castle-Bromwich</HI> who comeing to <HI>Wednes∣bury</HI> coal pits very early in the morning, two hours before day, hav∣ing mist his way, and guiding his <HI>fore-horse</HI> by the head, unlucki∣ly fell <HI>horse</HI> and all (the geers or harness breaking off) down into a <HI>Coal-pit</HI> 20 yards deep: yet had so little harme, that both <HI>horse</HI> and <HI>man</HI> were drawn out again so well, that the <HI>horse</HI> drew his part of the <HI>load,</HI> and the <HI>man</HI> (after 3 houres rest in a bed, whereby he re∣coverd that little distraction the fall had given him) waited on his <HI>team</HI> home the same night. The other instance is of one <HI>Dashfield</HI> a Coalier of <HI>Wednesbury,</HI> who being searching for <HI>coal</HI> in some old hollows, and wanting <HI>Air,</HI> repaired to an old <HI>shaft</HI> that had been fill'd up some years before, where loosening some earth at the bot∣tom, in hopes it would crack to the top, and give him Air; it so suddenly coped or colted down upon him, that being on every side inviron'd with it, he could not return, insomuch that all people concluded him smotherd. But he (whil'st they debated how to get him out) by the help of his <HI>Maundrill,</HI> by degrees so wrought away the earth over head, and getting it under his feet so raised himself still higher and higher, that at length he came out above ground safe and sound, having work't thus upwards at lest 9 yards in an houres time: which even the people thereabout who understand these <HI>works,</HI> look upon to this day as so strange performance, that the <HI>Man</HI> (now living) is still call'd <HI>Witch Dash∣field.</HI></P>
<P N="73">73. But of all the <HI>preservations</HI> of the life of <HI>Man</HI> that ever hap∣pen'd in this <HI>County,</HI> or perhaps any where else, wherein the pro∣vidence of <HI>God</HI> appear'd most miraculously, was that of his sacred <HI>Majesty</HI> of ever blessed memory King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, and of many of his <HI>followers</HI> that came along with him from the battle of <HI>Worcester:</HI> who though he first allighted about break of day at
<PB N="307" REF="206"/><HI>White-Ladies</HI> in <HI>Shropshire,</HI> whither he was conducted by M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Charles Giffard</HI> a Gent. of the ancient family of <HI>Chillington</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> yet as soon as he was disrobed of his <HI>Princely</HI> Ornaments, and had otherwise disguised himself by a <HI>Country</HI> habit of one of the <HI>Penderells;</HI> cuting off his hair: and rubbing his <HI>hands</HI> against the back of the <HI>Chimney,</HI> and with them his <HI>face;</HI> he was conducted first by <HI>Richard Penderel</HI> out at a back door, into the obscurest part of <HI>Rinshaw</HI> wood or spring Coppice in this <HI>County,</HI> where he was shelter'd from the rain (the Heavens weeping bitterly at these calamities) sitting upon a blanket borrowed of <HI>Francis Yates,</HI> un∣der one of the thickest <HI>trees</HI> in the wood, which not being well no∣ted has lost the honor, that was after given the <HI>Oak</HI> near <HI>Boscobel</HI> house; whither (after an unfortunate journey to <HI>Madeley</HI> in order to pass the <HI>Severn,</HI> and so into <HI>Wales</HI>) his <HI>Majestie</HI> removed two days after, and sate in the <HI>Oak;</HI> which though in the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Salop</HI> yet even there he rested in the Lap of a <HI>Staffordshire</HI> Gent.

<P N="74">74. Having rested at <HI>Boscobel</HI> two days, one in the <HI>Oak;</HI> the night in a <HI>privacy</HI> behind the <HI>Chimney</HI> in one of the Chambers; and the other in the house and garden; the night following he remov∣ed to <HI>Moseley</HI> to the house of the loyal Mr. <HI>Thomas Whitgreave</HI> of this <HI>County,</HI> where he was better accomodated with Linnen, and attended by Mr. <HI>Whitgreave</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Huddleston</HI> and my Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> who met him there: the several passages during his stay here were many of them remarkable, whereof I received an account from M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Whitgreave</HI> himself, which being punctually the same with those in the book call'd <HI>Boscobel,</HI> or <HI>Claustrum Regale reseratum.</HI> I remit the <HI>Reader</HI> thither<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Boscobel, or Claustrum Regale reserat. part. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE>. Hence after two days stay he was re∣moved to <HI>Bentley</HI> by the most loyal and faithfull Collonel <HI>John Lane,</HI> pursuant to a resolution taken up, that it was most expe∣dient his <HI>Majesty</HI> should move <HI>Westward</HI> (the <HI>Rebells</HI> most proba∣bly pursueing him <HI>Northward</HI>) which they had contrived should be done, under protection of a <HI>pass,</HI> accidentally procur'd be∣fore by the Collonels Sister M<SUP>rs</SUP>. <HI>Jane Lane,</HI> for her self and a man to goe beyond <HI>Bristol,</HI> to see M<SUP>rs</SUP>. <HI>Norton</HI> her special friend, then near her time of lyeing <HI>in.</HI></P>

What concerns <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women</HI> joyntly together also be∣longs to this place, upon which account their marriages purely considered may be referr'd hither: amongst which perhaps it may not be unworthy our notice, nor much beside our purpose, that <HI>William Overton</HI> Bishop of this Diocess marryed two wives, which lye buryed with him under the same <HI>Tomb</HI> in <HI>Eccleshal Church:</HI> which how agreeable to the 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.2. let the <HI>divines</HI> determin. All I shall say concerning it is, that the <HI>Apostle</HI> seem∣ing here to intimate that a <HI>Bishop</HI> should be chast in a higher de∣gree than other <HI>Christians,</HI> it cannot well be understood that a <HI>Bishop</HI> here is only forbid to marry another wife after divorce from a former, which our <HI>Saviour</HI> forbids all <HI>Christians</HI> whatever under the penalty of <HI>Adultery:</HI> but that it was not expedient at lest, he should marry a <HI>second</HI> wife after the death of the <HI>first,</HI> though allowable in others. Which being consonant to the 17 and 18 <HI>Apostolical Canons</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Vid Canones Sanct. Apost.

<P N="105">105. Now that there should be five <HI>generations</HI> living at a time, as in the present examples; or six, as in the instance of <HI>Mary Cooper</HI> above mentioned, is not indeed so wonderfull; since if People marry young enough, it may well be so: as in the case of my Lady <HI>Child</HI> in the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Salop,</HI> who as I was credibly informed being marryed at 12, had a Child in the 13<SUP>th</SUP>. year of her age; which Child being marryed as young, had another also at 13, so that this Lady was a <HI>Grand-mother</HI> at 27, and might possibly have been a <HI>great Grand-mo∣ther</HI> at 40, a <HI>great-great-Grand-mother</HI> at 53, and a <HI>Beldam</HI> at 66: but the marriages in our instances being not so early, the cases are the more remarkable. However this case of my Lady <HI>Child,</HI> compared with that of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Soldier mention'd by <HI>Ravenna</HI> will serve to shew how many generations 'tis pos∣sible may be existent at the same time: for if there may be six <HI>generations</HI> whereof the eldest need not be above 66, and that 4 <HI>generations</HI> have been living at a time, whereof the youngest has been 60, and the eldest not 120, (which how much longer they continued we have no account) it is plainly possible, that 9 <HI>generations</HI> may be existent together, as will plainly also ap∣pear by dividing 120 by 13. Or in case a man should live to 160,
<PB N="329" REF="219"/>as <HI>Roger Bacon</HI> says 'twas common for Country men to doe in his time<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Loco supra citato.</NOTE>: by the same rule 'tis evident, provided such a Mans off-spring all marry so young, that 'tis possible 12 generations of men may be all contemporaries.</P>
<P N="106">106.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Of Arts.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. BEfore I enter upon considering any particular <HI>Art,</HI> it may not perhaps be unnecessary to acquaint the <HI>Rea∣der,</HI> that <HI>Arts</HI> are not treated of here as a <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>ap∣pendix,</HI> or accession to the <HI>Work,</HI> but as properly falling under a <HI>Natural History; Art</HI> being nothing else but <HI>Nature</HI> restrained, forced, or fashioned, in her <HI>matter</HI> or <HI>motions:</HI> things of <HI>Art</HI> (as my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> well observes) not differing from those of <HI>Nature</HI> in forme or essence, but in the efficient only a. In the handel∣ing whereof I shall still pursue my foremention'd <HI>Method,</HI> and treat first of such. <HI>Arts</HI> as relate to the <HI>Heavens</HI> and <HI>Air;</HI> then of <HI>fire</HI> and <HI>water-works,</HI> and thirdly such as tend to the improve∣ment or better management of <HI>Earths, Stones,</HI> or <HI>Plants;</HI> and lastly of such as any way respect <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Women;</HI> under which I comprehend the new invention or advancement of any <HI>Mecha∣nick</HI> or other <HI>Art;</HI> which I doubt not may suffice for the fol∣lowing <HI>Chapter.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. And first in relation to the <HI>Heavens</HI> and <HI>Air,</HI> I have met with nothing new here, either concerning a further discovery of the <HI>Magnitudes,</HI> or determination of the <HI>Motions</HI> of any of the <HI>heavenly bodies;</HI> unless a new sort of <HI>Dyal</HI> (such an one at lest as was so to me) that I met with at the house of the Worshipfull <HI>Alexander Harcourt</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Ranton</HI> in this <HI>County;</HI> made of three boards representing a <HI>book</HI> open'd, six inches deep; with some of the <HI>middle leaves</HI> standing up between the <HI>Covers</HI> and some other <HI>leaves</HI> at six inches distance on each hand, all faceing the South, and so <HI>elevated</HI> as to stand parallel with the <HI>Axis</HI> of the <HI>World.</HI> Upon the <HI>East</HI> side of which <HI>middle leaves,</HI> the hour lines of 4 5 6 and 7 were drawn at their due distance to one another, the <HI>leaves</HI> and <HI>cover</HI> of the <HI>East</HI> side of the book being the <HI>Gnomon,</HI> to them; and on the <HI>West leaves</HI> and <HI>covers,</HI> the hour lines of 8, 9, 10, 11. the <HI>middle leaves</HI> of the <HI>book,</HI> elevat∣ed as above being their <HI>Gnomon;</HI> till the <HI>Sun</HI> comeing to the <HI>Meridian</HI> and striking them at right angles, casts no shade at all, which gives the hour of 12 as in other dyalls. Thence the <HI>Sun</HI> now having cut the <HI>Meridian</HI> (these <HI>middle leaves</HI> becoming<NOTE PLACE="foot">De Augm. Scient. Lib. <HI>2.</HI> cap. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="333" REF="221"/>the <HI>Gnomon</HI> again) throws the shade upon the <HI>Eastern leaves</HI> of the <HI>book;</HI> and there describes the hours 1, 2, 3, 4. and thence on the <HI>West</HI> side of the <HI>middle leaves</HI> 5, 6, 7, 8. the <HI>Western co∣vers</HI> being the <HI>Gnomon</HI> to them. Which sort of <HI>dyall</HI> being easy and pretty, and I think new (at least not commonly known) I thought worthy the mentioning.</P>
<P N="3">3. As I should also have done a most compendious, <HI>instrument</HI> first invented and made by the Worshipfull <HI>Francis Wolverstan</HI> of <HI>Statfold</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which he most properly calls a <HI>dyall Quadrant;</HI> whereby he not only obtains with speed, ease and exactness, the <HI>declination</HI> of all <HI>planes,</HI> with their <HI>verticals</HI> whether <HI>inclin∣ing, reclining,</HI> or <HI>declining,</HI> without giving himself the usual trouble of observing the obliquity or irregularity of them: but with great facility and accuracy also marks out the <HI>Center</HI> and <HI>substile</HI> of the designed <HI>dyall,</HI> with the several hourlines, and parts of hours, that the <HI>plane</HI> will admit. In short by this instrument he performs all sorts of <HI>dyalling</HI> with much less trouble than was anciently used. Which I should (I say) more particularly have described, but that it hath been printed already though surreptitiously in <HI>An.</HI> 1668 by one A. M. under his own name, without either the acquaintance or consent of the first <HI>Contriver;</HI> and that the like has since also been publish't by divers other <HI>Authors.</HI> Which is all concerning the <HI>Heavens</HI> and <HI>Air:</HI> but that my worthy frind M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Walter Jennings</HI> Rector of <HI>Church-Ey∣ton</HI> shewed me a very easy and cogent <HI>Experiment,</HI> proving the force of the rarefaction of the <HI>latter,</HI> by the <HI>Sand</HI> of an <HI>Hour∣glass,</HI> which running very freely, was stopt by holding a <HI>coal</HI> to the lower part of the glass; which as soon as withdrawn, the <HI>Sand</HI> ran again freely, and so <HI>toties quoties.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It being very improbable, that there is any other <HI>fire</HI> but such as that we call <HI>Culinary</HI> (that in the <HI>Concave</HI> of the <HI>Moon</HI> being a meer fancy of the <HI>Ancients</HI>) the <HI>Arts</HI> relating to the <HI>fire,</HI> must follow those of the <HI>Air.</HI> Amongst which it is not of the least consequence, that they improve their land here much by the help of <HI>fire,</HI> burning their <HI>turf</HI> first to ashes, either in their houses, or after the manner as described <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. §. 14, which they call <HI>Ess,</HI> and then laying them on their <HI>Meddow, Rye,</HI> or <HI>Barley</HI> grounds, which as some are of opinion bring more profit to the <HI>husbandman,</HI> than any other <HI>dung</HI> or <HI>soil</HI> whatever: the steril juices according to <HI>Virgil</HI> being destroyed in these,

<PB N="334" REF="222"/>to the production of <HI>Seed,</HI> whereas the <HI>dung</HI> of beasts and most other <HI>Soils,</HI> tend more to the sending up a rank straw or <HI>haum,</HI> and breeding of <HI>weeds.</HI> Upon which account says the same <HI>Virgil.</HI>

<P N="5">5. Upon these <HI>ashes,</HI> especially in windy weather, to prevent their blowing away, 'tis a common thing to cast <HI>parings</HI> of the <HI>earth</HI> near by, upon the most flaming parts, then <HI>turf</HI> or <HI>stubble</HI> again, then <HI>earth,</HI> and so <HI>stratum super stratum,</HI> and this they call <HI>burn-beating,</HI> and in some places <HI>Denshiring</HI> their land. Which I guess was also in use anciently, <HI>Virgil</HI> also asserting that they did in his time,
<Q>Effaetos cinerem <HI>immundum</HI> jactare per agros<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Georgic. Lib. <HI>1.</HI> v. <HI>81.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
And in a close about <HI>high-On,</HI> I saw them add to their <HI>ashes</HI> and <HI>earth,</HI> all the <HI>bushes, furse, broom, fern</HI> and other <HI>rubbish,</HI> they could find about the ground, which burnt together, so calcined the <HI>earth</HI> above and below, carrying away the cold <HI>steril juices,</HI> and substituting in its room such <HI>fertil Salts,</HI> that it yeilded there∣upon an increase far exceeding the charge and labour bestowed on it, and so I was told it would continue to doe, if layd upon <HI>dry</HI> land for 7 years together: but if upon <HI>moist washy</HI> land not above two. They also mix their ashes sometimes with <HI>Lime,</HI> which also belongs to this place being prepared by <HI>fire,</HI> which is so good a compost for their poor <HI>heathy</HI> land, that they often think it worth while to carry it twenty miles for this purpose: but of this no more, because of the manner of preparing it, its quali∣ties, &amp;c. at large elsewhere<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chap.</HI> 4. sect; §. 5, 6, 7, 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">6. Nor doe they only burn their <HI>turf, earth, bushes,</HI> and <HI>fern,</HI> to improve their land, but the latter of these in <HI>June</HI> when <HI>green,</HI> for another use: which that they may perform the better, they most commonly doe it on the side of a hill (as I saw them near <HI>Marbrook</HI>) lyeing to a fresh gale of wind. I was told they burnt it <HI>green,</HI> that the ashes might not fly away during the opera∣tion, which they certainly would doe, if the <HI>fern</HI> were suffer'd first to wither before it is burnt: but I guess the true reason may rather be, that whil'st it is <HI>green,</HI> it hath an <HI>oilyness</HI> in it which doth not quite consume, but remaining mixt with its <HI>ashes,</HI> makes them the fitter for the use they are ordinarily put to; these

<PB REF="224"/>
<PB N="335" REF="224"/>made up into <HI>balls</HI> of about 3 inches <HI>diameter</HI> by the poorer sort of people with warm water, being sold at 5 or 6 a pen∣ny to wash their <HI>buckings</HI> with, all the year about; wood ashes not being easy to be had, in a <HI>Country</HI> where their fewel is so generally coal, as it is in this.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>Art</HI> of making <HI>Fryingpans</HI> may also be referr'd hi∣ther, the Secret in great measure consisting in the regulating the <HI>heat,</HI> that is given the <HI>plates</HI> whereof they are made, before they are brought to the <HI>Anvil.</HI> Which together with other matters relating to the <HI>trade</HI> being found so difficult, that a <HI>Novice</HI> many times is little the better though he serve a double <HI>Apprenticeship</HI> to it; and so ingenious and indeed wonderfull, that I thought it incredible, what I heard related of it; I shall not scruple to give the <HI>Reader</HI> the full process thereof. First then in order to them, there are flat round plates hammer'd out of barrs at a forge for that purpose at the parish of <HI>Keel</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> not far from the fair Mansion of the Worshipfull and iudicious <HI>William Sneyd</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a worthy Benefactor to this work, which is here represented <HI>Tab.</HI> 28. the <HI>forge</HI> little differing from those of other <HI>Iron-works</HI> carrying a <HI>hammer</HI> of about 500 weight. In hammering of this <HI>flatwork</HI> they beat the <HI>plates</HI> first one by one, then two, three, or four together as they grow broader and thin∣ner, which stick not together, having not a <HI>heat</HI> given them sufficient for that: yet such an one they have, as will continue longer (the <HI>plates</HI> being forged many of them together) than if each <HI>plate</HI> had been forged single with a much higher heat, by which means the work is done not only with greater expedi∣tion, but profit too; the <HI>plates</HI> in this manner not only mu∣tually preserving their <HI>heat,</HI> but keeping each other also from <HI>scaleing,</HI> or being beaten too much away into Cinders or wast.</P>
<P N="8">8. When the <HI>flat-work</HI> is thus finish't at the <HI>Forge</HI> at <HI>Keel,</HI> they are then brought to another <HI>forge</HI> at <HI>New-Castle</HI> under <HI>Lyme,</HI> where <HI>John Holland,</HI> who is Maste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of both <HI>forges,</HI> works them into <HI>shape,</HI> nine <HI>fryingpan-plates</HI> being commonly laid upon one another, and claspt together by turning up 4 <HI>Labells</HI> which are ordinarily fixt to the lower plate, and so turned one within another like a <HI>nest</HI> of <HI>Crucibles</HI> or <HI>Boxes,</HI> the lowermost being always the biggest, and the uppermost the least; the whole nine, being turned nine times sooner than one single <HI>Pan:</HI> for the nine together mutually preserve their heat so long, that they are all turned during one <HI>heat;</HI> whereas one single pan will coole so fast, that it will require at least nine <HI>heats,</HI> before it can be forged, nor will it then be a good <HI>fryingpan</HI> neither: for it will so <HI>Scale</HI> away in the heating and forgeing, that it will at last
<PB N="336" REF="225"/>be but a thin infirm <HI>Pan.</HI> Now that which renders this <HI>Art</HI> of making <HI>fryingpans</HI> so difficult, is not only the bringing them to a just <HI>heat,</HI> which shall hold a sufficient time and yet not make them lyable to stick in the hammering; but the number of <HI>ham∣mers</HI> used in this work, which are not less than twenty of se∣veral sorts: which so few know how to manage, or are capable of learning; that there are but two Master <HI>Frying-pan makers</HI> (as I am credibly inform'd) in the whole <HI>Kingdom:</HI> one, here at <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and another at <HI>Wansworth</HI> in <HI>Surrey.</HI> They make also <HI>Dripping-Pans</HI> at these <HI>Forges,</HI> the <HI>plates</HI> being work't at the former, and the <HI>pans</HI> turned at the latter: but these being forged singly, and not in <HI>nests</HI> like the <HI>frying-pans,</HI> there is not the same difficulty, and consequently not the same ingenuity re∣quired, in the fabricating of them.</P>
<P N="9">9. Also at <HI>New-Castle</HI> under <HI>Lyme,</HI> the <HI>Tiles</HI> burnt in a <HI>Kill</HI> the usual way being found not to last: one M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Thomas Wood</HI> of the same <HI>Towne</HI> first contrived to burn them (which we may look upon as an <HI>Art</HI> relating to <HI>fire</HI>) in a <HI>Potters</HI> Oven: where∣in he made them so good and lasting, that notwithstanding they have been put to the hardship of dividing the parts of <HI>Garden∣knots,</HI> to endure not only the perpetual moisture of the earth, but frost, snow, and all sorts of weather: yet they few of them decay, scarce 5 <HI>Tiles</HI> in 500 having failed in 20 years time; so that now he has been followed by all the <HI>Country</HI> therea∣bout. It may also be look't upon as an <HI>Art</HI> not altogether forraigne to <HI>fire,</HI> that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> shewed at <HI>Stafford</HI> in the time of the Civil-warr <HI>temp. Car.</HI> 1. where standing in Cap∣tain <HI>Richard Sneyd</HI>'s garden at the high-house there, at about 60 yards distance, he made a shot at the <HI>weather-cock</HI> upon the Steeple of the Collegiat Church of S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Mary</HI> with a screw'd Horsmans pistol, and single bullet, which pierced its <HI>taile,</HI> the <HI>hole</HI> plainly appearing to all that were below: which the King then present judging as a Casualty only, the Prince presently proved the contrary by a second shoot to the same effect: the two <HI>holes</HI> through the <HI>weather-cocks</HI> taile (as an ample testi∣mony of the thing) remaining there to this day.</P>
<P N="10">10. To the <HI>fire-works</HI> succeed the <HI>Arts</HI> relating to <HI>waters;</HI> whereof some are for <HI>profit</HI> only, others for <HI>pleasure:</HI> amongst the former of these, the way of making a firme substantial <HI>Mill∣damm</HI> is not of the least consideration: which they doe here especially if they meet with a quick running sand by laying the foundation with <HI>unslaked Lime,</HI> which upon slaking amongst such sand turns as hard as stone, and so gives a sure foundation. But such as will not be at this charge, lay it first with <HI>water
<PB N="337" REF="225"/>clay,</HI> and then a <HI>stratum</HI> of <HI>Moss,</HI> then clay again, and then <HI>Moss,</HI> and so S. S. S. yet ramming them together so close that they become as it were a mixture. The superstructure next the water they face with <HI>turf,</HI> which again they face with a thatch of <HI>heath</HI> or <HI>ling,</HI> that enduring the water the best of any thing; then they lay <HI>gravel</HI> next, except near the <HI>Floodgate,</HI> where it must be <HI>clay.</HI> In the middle they lay a <HI>Key</HI> of <HI>clay,</HI> and <HI>gravel</HI> again toward the back of the <HI>damm,</HI> and then face it there too with <HI>turf,</HI> but not with <HI>ling,</HI> because the water beats not on it there, though sometimes they mend a breach also behind with it. Which is all relating to <HI>Mills;</HI> but that at <HI>Hamsted Hall</HI> there is a <HI>Corn-mill</HI> that pumps water up into a lofty house near it, whence all the <HI>Offices</HI> of the <HI>Hall</HI> are serv∣ed, the <HI>Pump</HI> working as the <HI>Mill-wheele</HI> goes to grind the Corn; much after the same manner as at the <HI>Water-house</HI> near the bridg at <HI>London.</HI> And that at M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Parker</HI>'s of <HI>Park-hall</HI> in the parish of <HI>Caverswall,</HI> I was shewed an <HI>Oat-Mill,</HI> that husk't the <HI>Oats</HI> and winnow'd them, and then ground them to <HI>meal:</HI> the last <HI>Mill</HI> that ground them, being not turned immediatly by the water, but by two <HI>wheels,</HI> whereof one was fastened to the <HI>runner</HI> of the first <HI>Mill,</HI> and the second to the <HI>runner</HI> of the <HI>grinding-Mill,</HI> a great rope interceding.</P>
<P N="11">11. This, I say had been all relating to <HI>Mills,</HI> except we may add, (as I think we may) that at the Honorable <HI>Harry Gray</HI>'s at <HI>Enfield Hall,</HI> the <HI>Spits</HI> in the <HI>Kitchin</HI> are turned with a <HI>Mill,</HI> the water being let through a <HI>Cock</HI> of above an inch bore into a little <HI>wheel</HI> of wood, made with <HI>Ladles</HI> to receive it exactly after the manner of an overshot <HI>Mill,</HI> which being placed without at the back of the <HI>Kitchin</HI> Chimney, turns a spin∣dle of Iron that passes through the brick-wall, at the end where∣of is a round wooden <HI>box</HI> which receives a <HI>Jack-line,</HI> that goes also through another <HI>box</HI> which turnes a second spindle above in the Chimney, that also carryes a <HI>box</HI> at the other end next the <HI>Mantle-tree,</HI> in which goe the <HI>lines</HI> that turne the <HI>spitts:</HI> all which the <HI>Reader</HI> may readily apprehend by <HI>Tab.</HI> 32. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. where

<P N="12">12. But before we leave the <HI>Arts</HI> belonging to the <HI>waters,</HI>
<PB N="338" REF="226"/>we must also remember they have an <HI>Art</HI> in this <HI>County</HI> of make∣ing good <HI>Ale:</HI> which being a liquid, and nothing else but boyl'd <HI>water</HI> impregnated with <HI>mault,</HI> must be referr'd hither. In the management whereof they have a knack of fineing it in three days time to that degree, that it shall not only be potable, but as clear and palatable as one would desire any drink of this kind to be: which though they are unwilling to owne it, I guess they doe by putting <HI>Alum</HI> or <HI>Vinegar</HI> in to it whil'st it is working, which, as D<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Willis</HI> asserts, will both stop the <HI>fermentation</HI> and precipitate the <HI>Lee,</HI> so as to render it as potable, as when it has stood a competent time to ripen<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Tho.

<P N="13">13. As for the <HI>Water-works</HI> of pleasure, there are none ve∣ry extraordinary in this <HI>County.</HI> In the Court of my Lord <HI>Ferrers</HI>'s house at <HI>Chartley</HI> there is a fair ancient <HI>fountain,</HI> where∣of the the <HI>Reader</HI> may have a view if he please to look back to <HI>Tab.</HI> 5. And in the curious garden South of <HI>Trentham Hall</HI> there is another that sends up a large <HI>Column</HI> of <HI>water</HI> falling into a <HI>bason</HI> of 10 yards <HI>diameter,</HI> which from the <HI>par∣lour</HI> (the folding doores opening just against it) yeilds a plea∣sant prospect: but much better would it be, were it made to toss a <HI>golden ball</HI> (as easily it might) and the designed <HI>Vista</HI> were cut through the adjoyning wood; which lying upon a rise∣ing ground, and taking up a mile in length must necessarily give it a great advantage. But the best <HI>Water-works</HI> here, and the greatest variety of them, are at S<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Richard Ashleys</HI> at <HI>Pateshull</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> where within a large <HI>Rotundo</HI> fenced about with a high wall of brick, opening with fair Gates of <HI>Iron-work</HI> against the <HI>Front</HI> of the house, there is a curious large foun∣tain that throws up a <HI>column</HI> of <HI>water</HI> near an inch <HI>diameter</HI> much higher than the former, which falls into a <HI>bason</HI> under∣neath, also proportionably larger, yeilding a most gratefull prospect not only toward the house, but to the <HI>walks</HI> above it.

<P N="22">22. For the <HI>heathy-land</HI> of this <HI>County,</HI> it is seldom inclosed; but when they intend it for <HI>tillage,</HI> which is never for above five years neither, and then it is throwne open to the <HI>Commons</HI> again. But when they doe inclose any part of it for this pur∣pose, they generally proceed in the manner following.

<P N="23">23.

In the <HI>Moorelands</HI> they sometimes <HI>Lime</HI> this <HI>heathy</HI> sort of land three or four years before they plow it, I suppose for the same reason that some lay their <HI>marle</HI> on the <HI>green-sword, Lime</HI> also working downward: others plow <HI>in</HI> the <HI>heath</HI> it selfe under furrow, only harrowing the surface of the <HI>reverse</HI> of the turfe, then sowing, and then harrowing it again: and the year following harrowing and sowing as before: letting the <HI>heath</HI> in the mean time still remain under, to be fully kil∣l'd and rotted, and enjoying two <HI>cropps</HI> from one plowing, which has been often done at <HI>Ipston</HI> in this <HI>County.</HI> But the best way in most mens opinions hereabout to manage this land, is to digg the <HI>turf</HI> and burn it upon the place in <HI>May,</HI> and to blend the <HI>Ess</HI> with <HI>Lime</HI> before <HI>Michaelmass,</HI> and then plowe it, and sowe the <HI>spring</HI> following: for this way their land will last 4 years, and give them 4 cropps in this order; first a crop of <HI>Barley,</HI> then <HI>Oats,</HI> then <HI>Rye,</HI> and then <HI>Oats</HI> a∣gain; and then lay'd down as long, may be plowed again, which they doe but once for any grain whatever all over the <HI>Moorelands.</HI></P>

Their <HI>broomy, gorsy</HI> or <HI>fursy,</HI> hot <HI>Sandy</HI> land, they first clear of those incumbrances, either by stocking them up with the <HI>Mattock,</HI> or drawing them up by the roots by a certain <HI>instru∣ment</HI> (which is much the quicker way) that I saw at the <HI>Red-Lyon</HI> at <HI>Brereton</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> made like a strong <HI>Lever,</HI> arm∣ed at about 18 inches or two foot from the greater end, with an iron hook or <HI>demi-pheon</HI> ingrail'd within, as they are com∣monly in <HI>Heraldry;</HI> having on the other side, but not diame∣trally opposite, also another <HI>hook</HI> fixt, like our barbarous <HI>fi∣gure</HI> of 7, as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 32. <HI>Fig.</HI> 2. with which, putting the greater <HI>hook</HI> under the branches of <HI>broom, furses,</HI> or <HI>bushes,</HI> and if stronger than ordinary, returning them under the second <HI>hook</HI> to prevent slipping, and then setting their shoulder under the further end (the instrument being about 3 yards long) they easily prize up <HI>bushes, furses,</HI> or <HI>broom</HI> by the very roots. This being done they then <HI>manure</HI> it with <HI>marle,</HI> which doth not only so fertilize it, as that it shall yeild the <HI>husbandman</HI> 7 or 8 cropps, but as some conceive frees it from the <HI>annoyance</HI> of these <HI>plants</HI> for ever after: tho' for my part I beleive it is rather the <HI>long tillage</HI> that usually follows this <HI>manure,</HI> than the <HI>marle</HI> that does it: for let such land be till'd but for 4 or 5 <HI>cropps,</HI> and then be laid downe, this <HI>trumpery</HI> will certainly re∣turn again (especially the <HI>gorse</HI>) tho' not so full as before.</P>

<P N="27">27. Having done with the <HI>methods</HI> of ordering their <HI>lands,</HI> let us next consider their <HI>manures</HI> and <HI>seeds</HI> a little more par∣ticularly in their <HI>quantites</HI> and <HI>choise.</HI> As to the former where∣of, I find they use a great latitude, especially in their <HI>Cow, horse,</HI> or <HI>mixen</HI> dung; which Men many times lay on not so much according to their judgment, as according to the stock they have of it. Nor is the <HI>condition</HI> of the <HI>soile</HI> altogether to be unreguarded: for I find (for Example in <HI>marling</HI> their lands) that upon their sound grounds whether <HI>Clay</HI> or <HI>Gravelly,</HI> they seldom lay above eight or nine score, or two hundred loads on an <HI>Acre:</HI> whereas if it be <HI>cold black land; loose</HI> and <HI>sandy;</HI> or <HI>loose wormey ground;</HI> they will commonly lay on <HI>three,</HI> nay I was told of some that laid on <HI>four</HI> hundred loads: and in∣deed for such land as <HI>that,</HI> it cannot be <HI>over-marled.</HI> Where by the way let it be noted, that tho' I say they lay on 400 loads, yet I intend no more than on the <HI>Statute Acre,</HI> and not the <HI>customary Acre</HI> they have in some places amongst their <HI>Copy-hold</HI> lands, which is of no certain quantity; it contain∣ing sometimes at lest 7 <HI>Statute Acres,</HI> and at other places a∣gain perhaps not above <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P N="28">28. But tho' there is little danger of <HI>overmarling</HI> such sorts of lands, yet of some others there may: and therefore in some places they always observe the <HI>thickness</HI> of their mold above the <HI>Catbrain</HI> (as they call it) i. e. a sort of barren <HI>clay</HI> and <HI>stone</HI> mixt; which if they find but <HI>thin,</HI> they <HI>marle</HI> that land pro∣portionably <HI>less;</HI> but if <HI>thick,</HI> they also <HI>marle</HI> it accordingly: for to lay a great deal of <HI>marle</HI> upon <HI>thin</HI> land, will produce but a mean, if any cropp at all. In short, this sort of <HI>im∣provement</HI> howsoever variously used, stands recommended to us,
<PB N="346" REF="230"/>not only from it's long and continual <HI>use</HI> here amongst us, ever since the days of <HI>Pliny,</HI> who expressly says, that the <HI>Britans</HI> used it in his time; but from its keeping the ground in heart beyond all other <HI>composts; Pliny</HI> asserting that it will hold for 50 years together<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">C.

We find indeed now that it doth not last to any great effect above 8 or 9 cropps, yet I beleive the land may be the better for it for so long time: for this always in some measure keeps up the <HI>heart</HI> of the <HI>soil,</HI> and does not eat it out after the manner of <HI>Lime.</HI> They generally <HI>marle</HI> their lands in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> but for no other reason, but that they have most leasure then, it being betwixt <HI>seed-time,</HI> and <HI>har∣vest.</HI></P>
<P N="29">29. Beside the <HI>manures</HI> above mentioned, there are several <HI>others</HI> I met with in the <HI>Country</HI> that must not be past by: such as <HI>dung, lime,</HI> and <HI>mould,</HI> rotted together, which laid up∣on <HI>arable land</HI> makes a good improvement.

<P N="32">32. In the <HI>choise</HI> of their <HI>seed</HI> (<HI>here</HI> as in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI>) they have a double respect; first, to the <HI>grain</HI> it self; and second∣ly, to the <HI>land</HI> it grew on.

<PB N="348" REF="231"/>accipere manifestum est</HI> s. that lean seed, can never produce a fair full Corn.

<P N="33">33.

<P N="37">37. If their Lands be subject to <HI>blasting, smutting, Meldews,</HI> or <HI>birds,</HI> they endeavour to prevent them either in the pre∣paring, or choise of their <HI>seed</HI> before sowing; or after their corn is come to <HI>seed</HI> again. To avoid <HI>blasting,</HI> and <HI>smutting,</HI> they steep their grain in <HI>brine</HI> before they sowe it, which they e∣steem a very probable, if not a certain <HI>remedy</HI> for this <HI>desease</HI> of corn: it having been found by <HI>experience,</HI> that part of a field of <HI>wheat,</HI> the <HI>seed</HI> whereof was <HI>brined,</HI> has been clear of <HI>blast</HI> and <HI>smutt;</HI> whereas the other part where the <HI>seed</HI> was sown without <HI>brineing;</HI> has suffered much by both. To prevent <HI>Meldewing,</HI> the most pernicious of all the <HI>annoyances,</HI> that <HI>in∣closures</HI> and <HI>rich lands</HI> are lyable to, <HI>Thomas Cartwright</HI> parish <HI>Clerk</HI> of <HI>Womburn</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> either mixes his corn with <HI>soot</HI> before he sowes it, or sowes <HI>soot</HI> upon it after the <HI>wheat</HI>'s in the ground: by which means he has preserv'd the corn from being <HI>Meldewed,</HI> in <HI>lands</HI> always observed to have been lyable to it, and this not for one or two, but for ten years together: the more <HI>soot</HI> he has mixt or sown, proving so much the better, tho of the two, he finds <HI>mixing</HI> to succeed the best. Which being matter of fact, and the <HI>cure</HI> considerable, because the <HI>disease</HI> is so; it may be worth while perhaps to look into the <HI>causes</HI> of this
<PB N="351" REF="232"/><HI>annoyance,</HI> and how it comes to pass that <HI>this</HI> proves a <HI>Medicin</HI> for it.</P>
<P N="38">38. First then, as to the <HI>causes</HI> of <HI>Meldews,</HI> some have thought them much occasioned, by an unseasonable time of sowing, and therefore have sown very early, as judging <HI>corn</HI> most subject to this <HI>desease</HI> when sown late: but this cause is certainly but ill grounded, some land <HI>meldewing</HI> at what time soever they are sown. Others again have placed the <HI>origin</HI> of <HI>meldewing</HI> in making <HI>small inclosures, corn</HI> not being so lyable to this <HI>evil</HI> in the common open fields: which tho' it must be confest in part, yet this can be but an <HI>accidental cause</HI> at most; for let the <HI>inclosures</HI> be never so <HI>small,</HI> so the land be <HI>poore,</HI> the <HI>corn</HI> that it bears shall rarely be <HI>meldew'd.</HI> It remains there∣fore that the <HI>adequat original cause</HI> of this <HI>malady,</HI> must be in the <HI>richness</HI> of the <HI>soile,</HI> especially if not naturally, but made such by <HI>dung,</HI> which fattening it, and sending up a moist <HI>viscous steam,</HI> that upon <HI>congelation</HI> in the <HI>Air</HI> falls down upon the <HI>corn</HI> again in a <HI>dew</HI> of the sweetness and consistence of hony, and there sticking to the <HI>straw,</HI> and further harden'd by the <HI>Sun,</HI> so binds up the <HI>pores</HI> of it, that the <HI>nourishing juice</HI> in great measure is prevented thereby, ascending to the <HI>ear:</HI> whence the <HI>grain</HI> becoms <HI>shrank,</HI> as we commonly see it in all <HI>corn</HI> af∣fected with this <HI>distemper.</HI> And this I take to be the true <HI>ori∣gin,</HI> and <HI>process</HI> of <HI>Meldewing.</HI></P>
<P N="39">39. Now if this <HI>steam</HI> when ascended, be any way hinder∣ed, being dispersed by the <HI>wind,</HI> or shaken off the <HI>stalks</HI> of the <HI>corn,</HI> when fallen on them, by the <HI>height</HI> or <HI>narrowness</HI> of <HI>inclosures,</HI> it must be owned that they are thus farr an <HI>accidental social cause</HI> of <HI>Meldews:</HI> but for their true <HI>original</HI> I beleive it to be nothing else but that <HI>viscous steam</HI> rais'd by the heat of the <HI>Sun</HI> out of the fattness of the <HI>dung,</HI> which if suck't up, or kept down by any dry adust matter, that it cannot ascend at all, as I suppose it is by the <HI>soot,</HI> the <HI>annoyance</HI> thereby is fully prevented: and any other such <HI>matter</HI> what ever else it be that may hereafter be found out that will doe this, may also very well be thought a proper <HI>remedy</HI> for this <HI>distemper.</HI> If it be objected that this <HI>medicin</HI> is to narrow for the <HI>disease,</HI> there not being quantities of <HI>soot</HI> to be had in proportion to the <HI>lands</HI> that are lyable to <HI>meldews:</HI> I answer that this hinders not but that it is a true <HI>antidote</HI> as farr as it will goe; and that where this cannot be had plentifully enough, other <HI>remedies</HI> must be used, such as <HI>sowing bearded wheat,</HI> whose <HI>ailes</HI> catching the <HI>dew,</HI> do prevent in great measure its falling on the <HI>straw,</HI> and doeing the <HI>mischeif</HI> abovemention'd.</P>
<P N="40"><PB N="352" REF="233"/>40. But if there be any such <HI>land</HI> that lyes so untowardly (as perhaps there may some) that neither of these can be conve∣niently had or used; my advice is then, that the <HI>order</HI> of <HI>sow∣ing</HI> it be wholy inverted; that is, that they doe not immediat∣ly sow <HI>wheat</HI> after the <HI>dunging</HI> such land, but first <HI>barley,</HI> then <HI>peas,</HI> and <HI>wheat</HI> last: because by this means the <HI>stock</HI> of matter in the <HI>dung</HI> that occasions these <HI>Mildews,</HI> will be spent in the time of the <HI>barley</HI> and <HI>peas</HI> that are not, before the <HI>corn</HI> comes to be sown that is, lyable to them. To prevent any <HI>grain</HI>'s being de∣stroyed by <HI>birds,</HI> presently as soon as sown, both <HI>limeing,</HI> and <HI>mixing</HI> it with <HI>soot</HI> as above, have been found effectual: but when come to seed again (I mean whilst in the <HI>ear</HI>) I met with no device here that would secure it from them, only in a <HI>hemp plat</HI> in the way betwixt <HI>Whitemore</HI> and <HI>Ashley</HI> I found empty <HI>egg-shells</HI> hung upon most of the <HI>stalks</HI> of the <HI>seed-Hemp,</HI> which they told me was a contrivance to preserve them from the <HI>birds,</HI> which being a very odd one, I could not without in∣jury to the <HI>Readers</HI> diversion, but take notice of it.</P>
<P N="41">41. Thus having given some account of the <HI>tillage</HI> of this <HI>County,</HI> their several <HI>manures,</HI> the quantities and choise of <HI>seeds,</HI> and the methods of preventing the <HI>annoyances</HI> of corn: I pro∣ceed to the <HI>Instruments</HI> they use in their <HI>tillage.</HI> And first of the <HI>ploughs,</HI> which are generally the same here, with those of other <HI>Counties,</HI> nor met I with any thing uncommon relating to them, any where but at <HI>Frodswell,</HI> where one M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Fernyhough</HI> shewed me an <HI>instrument</HI> of <HI>Iron</HI> of his own invention set through the <HI>plow-beam</HI> behind the <HI>Coulter,</HI> and through the <HI>plow-head,</HI> steel∣ed with an edg forward, of excellent use in plowing <HI>new stock't grounds,</HI> it cuting <HI>roots</HI> asunder as bigg as ones arm without prejudice to the <HI>plough;</HI> which were it not for the strength that is also given it by this <HI>Irons</HI> goeing through the <HI>plow-beam</HI> and <HI>head,</HI> must needs quickly be torn in pieces with such work as that. Yet now I remember M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Ashmore</HI> of <HI>Tamworth</HI> also sent me an account of much such a <HI>plow</HI> with two sharp <HI>wings</HI> of iron made fast to the <HI>plow-share,</HI> and following the <HI>Coulter</HI> on each side, that he had likewise contrived for the same purpose. They also draw their ploughs here both with <HI>Oxen</HI> and <HI>Horses;</HI> but at many places rather with the <HI>former</HI> than <HI>latter,</HI> because of their turning to a more certain profit, and having less of hazard in them: <HI>Oxen</HI> always increasing in <HI>price</HI> with their <HI>fatness;</HI> and if <HI>sick,</HI> or comeing to any <HI>mischance,</HI> yet may be kill'd to some profit, which a <HI>Horse</HI> cannot be. They generally <HI>plough</HI> with their <HI>Oxen</HI> in <HI>pairs,</HI> but with their <HI>Horses</HI> in a <HI>string,</HI> to prevent <HI>poching</HI> the land: and so they doe in some places with their
<PB N="353" REF="233"/><HI>Oxen</HI> too, in very wet seasons, being furnish't with <HI>half yoaks</HI> for that very purpose.</P>
<P N="42">42. After their <HI>Corn</HI> is sown they cover it with <HI>Harrows,</HI> not much differring from those of other <HI>Countries;</HI> only in the <HI>Moore∣lands</HI> I observed they were somewhat less than ordinary, but very strong ones. But in the <HI>Moorelands</HI> they never <HI>roll</HI> their barley, I suppose because they <HI>mow</HI> none, and therefore have no such instrument as a <HI>Roll</HI> among them. When their <HI>Corn</HI> is come up (especially their <HI>Oats</HI> and <HI>Barley</HI>) if sown on a bind∣ing land, and it prove a dry time; at and about <HI>Church-Eyton</HI> they sometimes <HI>harrow</HI> them again, to break the clodds and loosen the earth, which will make them flourish much the bet∣ter: for tho' it may pluck some up, yet it making more spring by half than it destroyes, they account it advantagious. Af∣ter the <HI>Corn</HI> is in the <HI>blade,</HI> if it grow too ranck, as at some places they eat it off with <HI>Sheep:</HI> at <HI>Alrewas</HI> in this <HI>County</HI> they <HI>mow</HI> off the topps of it before it spindles, which they doe with a <HI>reaping-hook,</HI> not a <HI>Sithe.</HI> And before their <HI>Corn</HI> is ripe, about the latter end of <HI>May</HI> or beginning of <HI>June,</HI> they weed their <HI>Wheat, Rye,</HI> and <HI>Barley,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Oats,</HI> with an Iron <HI>digger,</HI> and another instrument like a pair of <HI>Smiths-tonges</HI> jag∣ged like a <HI>Rasp</HI> on the inner sides to take the firmer hold; with which they pluck up the weeds by the roots, which being <HI>pe∣rennial plants,</HI> springing annually anew, I look upon as much a better <HI>instrument,</HI> than the <HI>hooks</HI> of other <HI>Countries,</HI> which only cut them off above ground, so that if <HI>weeded</HI> early, they grow up again before the <HI>Corn</HI>'s ripe, at lest the next year, from the same root.</P>

When time of <HI>harvest</HI> is come, they <HI>reap</HI> their <HI>wheat</HI> and <HI>bind</HI> it after the manner of other <HI>Counties,</HI> and so they doe their <HI>Rye;</HI> when bound they gather <HI>nine</HI> sheaves together, and set them upon their butt-ends, and cover them with <HI>three,</HI> and so let them stand ten or twelve days, according as the <HI>weather</HI> proves, before they carry them; the <HI>Corn</HI> thrashing the better, the longer it stands. Their <HI>barley</HI> they mow with the <HI>Sithe</HI> and <HI>Cadar</HI> in the <HI>South</HI> parts of the <HI>County,</HI> and in some places where the land was never <HI>roll'd,</HI> especially where light and easily <HI>clod∣ded;</HI> but in the <HI>Moorelands</HI> as they <HI>roll</HI> not, so they never <HI>mow</HI> their <HI>barley,</HI> but <HI>reap</HI> it with <HI>hooks,</HI> the land being generally so <HI>grasy</HI> there, that they would loose half their <HI>Corn</HI> should they goe about to <HI>mow</HI> it, especially should there happen a wett season, for that it could hardly then be ever got dry again. In the <HI>Sou∣thern</HI> parts if clean and free from weeds, they <HI>bind</HI> and <HI>cock</HI> it as they doe <HI>Wheat</HI> and <HI>Rye:</HI> but if <HI>grasy</HI> or have <HI>weeds</HI> in it; they
<PB N="354" REF="234"/>let it lye to wither two or three days, then <HI>rake</HI> it together and <HI>cock</HI> it as in the <HI>Moorelands,</HI> letting it stand five or six days be∣fore they carry it. Their <HI>Oats</HI> they <HI>harvest</HI> much after the same manner they doe their barley. But their <HI>beans</HI> and <HI>peas</HI> they seldom <HI>mow,</HI> but <HI>reap</HI> them with <HI>hooks,</HI> letting them lye in <HI>reaps</HI> 12 or 14 days, and never turning them but once, <HI>viz.</HI> the day before they carry them.</P>

For <HI>Waynes, Carts,</HI> and <HI>Waggons,</HI> they use the very same for carriage of their <HI>Corn,</HI> and other matters, that they doe in other <HI>Counties;</HI> only some of them I met with that had certain <HI>pecularities</HI> that I never saw elsewhere; particularly betwixt <HI>Normacot</HI> and <HI>Weston Coyney</HI> I met with a <HI>Cart</HI> that had its <HI>floats</HI> supported, with <HI>standards</HI> erected upon the ends of the <HI>Axles</HI> without the <HI>nathes</HI> of the <HI>wheels;</HI> which seeming much firmer than the usual ones resting on the out <HI>timbers</HI> of the <HI>bedd</HI> of the <HI>Cart,</HI> I thought them worth mentioning. And at <HI>Pillaton-Hall</HI> the Seat of the Worshipfull <HI>Edward Littleton</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> I was shewn a sort of <HI>carriage</HI> indifferently serving for a <HI>Cart</HI> or a <HI>Tumbrel,</HI> the <HI>Cart-ladder</HI> or <HI>thripple</HI> both before and behind being to be taken off at pleasure, and the <HI>Tumbrel</HI> to be made fast to, or loosed from the <HI>Thilles;</HI> like the <HI>Whiplade</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Nat.

But the od∣dest <HI>carriage</HI> of all I saw at <HI>Dimsdale</HI> near <HI>Wolstanton</HI> (used cheifly I suppose for the portage of <HI>Hay</HI>) made only of two strong pieces of <HI>timber</HI> dragging on the ground, and a <HI>thripple</HI> behind, with which they could carry a pretty parcel of <HI>Hay,</HI> or any such like <HI>commodity.</HI></P>
<P N="45">45. When they have carry'd their <HI>Corn,</HI> tho' they lodg it in a <HI>barn,</HI> it is yet subject to the dammage of <HI>mice</HI> and <HI>ratts;</HI> to free themselves of which <HI>Vermin</HI> many have been the contrivan∣ces of ingenious men: but none that I know of so clear of <HI>in∣conveniencies,</HI> as what was reported to me by M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Alsager</HI> of <HI>Standon,</HI> who seriously told me there was nothing would more infallibly drive these mischeivous <HI>Animals</HI> (especially the <HI>Ratts</HI>) from a <HI>house</HI> or <HI>barn,</HI> than laying <HI>bird-lime</HI> in their <HI>haunts:</HI> for tho' they are nasty enough in other respects, yet being very curious of their <HI>furr,</HI> if but dawb'd with this stuff, it is so trouble∣some to them, that they will even scratch their skins from their own <HI>backs</HI> to get it off, and tho' he thinks not they ever de∣stroy themselves upon this account, yet they will never abide the place where they have suffer'd in this manner. If they have not room to <HI>imbarn</HI> their <HI>Corn,</HI> they commonly set it up in <HI>ricks</HI> upon <HI>staddles</HI> as they doe in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and thatch it with
<PB N="355" REF="234"/><HI>broom</HI> or <HI>heath</HI> to preserve it from <HI>rain,</HI> laying at the bottom next the timbers that lye on the <HI>staddles,</HI> a range of <HI>furse-fag∣gots,</HI> which perhaps prevent the ascent of <HI>mice</HI> and <HI>ratts</HI> better than the <HI>staddles</HI> themselves. Which is all concerning <HI>Corn</HI> whilst in the <HI>blade</HI> or <HI>straw,</HI> but that at some places they still thrash it, after the ancient manner <HI>sub dio,</HI> as I saw them upon the <HI>pavement</HI> in the open streets at <HI>Burton</HI> upon <HI>Trent.</HI> And that they drye their <HI>Oats</HI> in great measure with their own <HI>husks,</HI> which thrown upon <HI>turf</HI> set archwise as in <HI>Tab</HI> 32. <HI>Fig.</HI> 3. burn freely enough.</P>

Which I guess they doe upon the same principle, that <HI>soot</HI> prevents <HI>Meldews,</HI> imbibing the <HI>steril juices</HI> that produce such <HI>trumpery,</HI> and substituting good wholesom <HI>clover</HI> in the room; which not only the <HI>ashes</HI> of <HI>coal,</HI> but of <HI>wood,</HI> and <HI>fern</HI> too, are all observed to doe; whereof about 30 <HI>strike</HI> serve an <HI>Acre,</HI> which they chuse to lay on in the <HI>spring,</HI> rather than <HI>Winter,</HI> for that the <HI>rains</HI> wash them away and de∣stroy their virtue.</P>

<PB N="356" REF="235"/>up of themselves, and then the cold <HI>steril juices</HI> will return again, destroy the <HI>Medicin,</HI> &amp; quickly produce the same <HI>disease.</HI> To prevent which inconveniency, M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Astley</HI> of <HI>Tamhorn</HI> drains such Grounds much after the manner as described in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Nat.

And this way of <HI>trenching</HI> one would think were sufficient to all intents and purposes; yet M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Sylvester</HI> of <HI>Weeford</HI> seems further to have improved it, by the invention of an <HI>instrument</HI> to make such a <HI>Sough</HI> without break∣ing the ground, but at some certain distances; being much like a <HI>shovel</HI> about 4 foot long, with which he first diggs a hole deep and large enough to receive a <HI>Man,</HI> together with his <HI>instrument;</HI> then he excavates the <HI>hollow-black-earth</HI> as far as his <HI>instrument</HI> will reach both ways, i. e. eight foot beside the <HI>diameter</HI> of the hole, leaving the upper turf a yard thick above it; then at the same distances on a <HI>line,</HI> from eight foot to eight foot, he makes other <HI>holes,</HI> and so still on as the work requires: and then putting in <HI>Alders</HI> (whereof they have commonly great plenty in all moorish grounds) or other fit materialls, as <HI>brush-wood,</HI> &amp;c. to keep the earth from falling in and choaking the <HI>Sough,</HI> it will drain the ground to that rate, that many times it will <HI>sink</HI> a <HI>yard</HI> or more: which he after improves with all sorts of <HI>Ashes</HI> laid on dry as above; which kills the <HI>Moss,</HI> &amp;c. produces the <HI>Meddow-trefoile,</HI> and brings it at last to be good <HI>Meddow</HI>-ground.</P>
<P N="48">48. Nor are such <HI>boggy, peaty,</HI> and <HI>cold-black-lands,</HI> that bear little else but <HI>rushes,</HI> &amp;c. only improved by draining and lay∣ing them dry by <HI>Soughs:</HI> but where there is conveniency also, by being artificially <HI>water'd</HI> or <HI>overflown.</HI> The best instance whereof that I met with in this <HI>County,</HI> was at <HI>Drayton</HI> park be∣longing to the right Honorable the Lord <HI>Visc. Weymouth,</HI> a most noble <HI>Patron</HI> of this work; where his Lordship having the ad∣vantage of the <HI>black-brook</HI> passing through it, tho' esteemed but a <HI>lean hard</HI> water, yet by cutting a <HI>fleme</HI> or main <HI>carriage</HI> 18 foot broad and scarce a yard deep, on the upper side of about 35. <HI>Acres</HI> (at one place) of such <HI>land;</HI> and smaller <HI>carriages</HI> or trenches 40 or 50 yards asunder, not above 4 foot wide, all issueing from the said main <HI>fleme;</HI> each of these smaller <HI>carriages</HI> having a yet smaller <HI>drain</HI> of a foot wide, to carry off the water again at
<PB N="357" REF="235"/>discretion, as it was brought on by the greater: his Lordship by this means has so improved this <HI>land,</HI> tho' the water but bad, (yet much better it seems than that <HI>steril juice</HI> that it had be∣fore, which is hereby drawn off) that in 2 years time, whereas it was thought to be dear of <HI>three,</HI> it became worth at lest 30 <HI>shil∣lings</HI> an <HI>Acre.</HI> The 35 <HI>Acres</HI> in <HI>An.</HI> 1682 bearing 40 loads of good <HI>Hay,</HI> the grass after being worth 10 or 12 pounds be∣side. Another improvement of this sort of <HI>Land,</HI> if it be full of <HI>Mossy, Sedgy, Heathy Hillocks,</HI> as many times it is; is by le∣velling them by a short strong <HI>Sithe</HI> about 2 foot ½ long, fitted with a strong <HI>Snead,</HI> with which a man at three blowes, can cut up a <HI>Hillock</HI> a yard and ½, or 2 yards wide; and will doe as much in a day as 4 Men can of the same work, in the same time, with their <HI>shovels.</HI></P>
<P N="49">49. And thus having shewn the several <HI>Methods</HI> of preserv∣ing both <HI>arable</HI> and <HI>pasture grounds</HI> from their inbred <HI>Enemies,</HI> let us see what other uncommon <HI>Arts</HI> have been used to secure them from those without, such as spoile by <HI>cattle, Hunters,</HI> &amp;c. that is, what extraordinary sorts of <HI>fencing</HI> have been found out here, for preserving of their <HI>grounds</HI> unusual elsewhere. A∣mongst which for a <HI>living-fence,</HI> I met with none so artificial and serviceal as those, made by the <HI>planching</HI> of <HI>Quicksets</HI> i. e. cuting them half through, and laying them cross the ditch up∣on the adverse bank, and laying some <HI>earth</HI> upon them to keep them down, first <HI>hacking</HI> each branch to make them sprout, by which means there may be made as many <HI>hedges,</HI> one with∣in another as shall be thought fitting, all still proceeding from the first roots. And for a <HI>dead-fence,</HI> none certainly better (where the <HI>grounds</HI> afford them) than those <HI>heathy-turf walls</HI> made by M<SUP>r.</SUP> <HI>Ashmore</HI> on <HI>Packington</HI> heath, which he orders thus: the <HI>turf</HI> being quickly cut by a strong <HI>plow,</HI> the <HI>Workmen</HI> then have little more to doe in order to them, but to cut the plowed turf into suitable pieces of two foot long; which, laying the rough side outmost, and filling up every course close, with such mould or sand as the place affords, will make <HI>walls</HI> so firm (not∣withstanding they will shrink near a quarter part, which must be allow'd for in the making) that with little repairs 'tis be∣leiv'd may stand at lest 20 years, if well made at first, espe∣cially if betwixt <HI>Michalemass</HI> and <HI>Christmass,</HI> for then a great part of the <HI>turf</HI> will grow for several years, so that these are not ab∣solutely <HI>dead-fences</HI> neither: however they are found of singular use, especially for sheltering <HI>Sheep</HI> from cold storms and blasts, which they doe to that effect, that <HI>Sheep</HI> will now abide that <HI>heath</HI> and feed upon <HI>Ling</HI> all the hardest winter, which
<PB N="358" REF="236"/>they could never be made to do, before this <HI>contrivance.</HI></P>

Having done with the <HI>tillage</HI> and <HI>productions</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> I should have come next to the <HI>Arts</HI> of <HI>forming</HI> them into di∣vers shapes for their respective uses: but having treated al∣ready of the whole <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Pottery</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chap. <HI>3.</HI> from §. <HI>25.</HI> to §. <HI>28.</HI> inclusive.</NOTE>, I have little to add, but that <HI>Charles Riggs</HI> of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> has a sort of <HI>Engin</HI> I never saw elsewhere, with which he punches the <HI>bolls</HI> of his <HI>Tobacco∣pipes</HI> much quicker and truer than others of his <HI>trade,</HI> unac∣quainted with this <HI>instrument;</HI> which being invented as he told me in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in justice to the <HI>Country</HI> I for∣bear more of it here. And proceed to a sort of <HI>arched-Bricks</HI> they make about <HI>Wednesbury,</HI> bent round to sit the <HI>Eyes</HI> of their <HI>Cole-pits,</HI> which are generally about 2 yards in <HI>diameter,</HI> by which they are secured from colting in, much better than by <HI>timbers,</HI> as I saw some pits near that <HI>Town,</HI> thus wall'd up with them for two yards deep, there being no necessity of doe∣ing it lower there, the <HI>clay</HI> being after <HI>stiff</HI> enough to uphold it self. To which we may add that their <HI>Quadrells</HI> of <HI>peat,</HI> are made into that fashion by the <HI>spade</HI> that cutts them, which is nothing else but a thin iron plate bent to a right angle with equilaterial sides, so that it makes the half of an oblong right∣angled <HI>parallelepiped</HI> cut <HI>diagonally.</HI> being somewhat like the composing stick of a <HI>Printer,</HI> which at two cuts brings out one of these <HI>Quadrells,</HI> which they set to dry, as described in <HI>Oxfordshire.</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Nat.

<P N="70">70. Nor could I perceive any <HI>inconveniency</HI> it it, but that the <HI>staires</HI> were somewhat <HI>deeper,</HI> and the <HI>ascent</HI> somewhat more <HI>steep,</HI> than ordinary, as indeed the nature of the thing requires: for it being necessary that the <HI>floors</HI> and <HI>roofs</HI> should be distant at lest a mans height, one must needs ascend in a single revolu∣tion of the <HI>Cochlea</HI> or <HI>spiral,</HI> as much as between <HI>d</HI> and <HI>f,</HI> i. e. twice the height of a man; whereas had there been but a single pair of <HI>stairs,</HI> the <HI>ascent</HI> need not have been but from <HI>d</HI> to 2, a

But
<PB REF="247"/>
<PB REF="248"/>
<PB REF="248"/>
<PB REF="249"/>
<PB N="373" REF="249"/>of late they have used divers other <HI>materials</HI> for this purpose, and after a different manner; it being done at <HI>Wolver hampton,</HI> with burnt <HI>hoofs,</HI> and <HI>hornes, fountain</HI> and <HI>bay-salt, sublimat, Ʋrin,</HI> old burnt <HI>leather,</HI> and <HI>Tartar,</HI> all mix't together, and re∣duced into pouder, in which rolling their <HI>Iron</HI> first made red hot, it will stick to it, and is thus returned into the fire again to receive its <HI>hardening,</HI> which it does not quite through the whole body of the <HI>Iron,</HI> but only on the outside for about the thickness of a shilling at most, which is highly sufficient to re∣ceive a polish.</P>
<P N="74">74. But out of these, and some few other <HI>materials,</HI> they have observed that two sorts of <HI>hardening</HI> arise, viz. <HI>tough-harden∣ing,</HI> and <HI>brittle-hardening;</HI> the former whereof they perform with <HI>old-shoos burnt, Ʋrin,</HI> and <HI>Wood-soot,</HI> with which when any Iron is hardened it will not <HI>scale</HI> in the lest; and the lat∣ter, with <HI>old shoos, tupps horns, bay-salt,</HI> and <HI>Argal</HI> or <HI>Tartar;</HI> which harden Iron to the height, and give the brightest <HI>polish,</HI> tho' they render it <HI>brittle:</HI> but I was told by others that the <HI>toughest-hardening</HI> was made, by the juice of <HI>nettles,</HI> Mans <HI>urin,</HI> and <HI>Linseed-oyle;</HI> and the <HI>highest,</HI> by quenching red hot Iron in the juice of <HI>Mouseare;</HI> which processes are understood by most <HI>Smiths</HI> in the <HI>County:</HI> and so they were most of them anciently, as may plainly be seen in <HI>Baptista Porta, de re ferraria</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Joh.

<PB N="374" REF="250"/>at the Tile-house at <HI>Bromley</HI> in the parish of <HI>Kings-Swinford,</HI> one <HI>John Heydon</HI> hardens whole barrs of <HI>Iron</HI> quite through, i. e. makes them into <HI>Steel,</HI> which he does not out of <HI>English,</HI> but <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> or <HI>Swedish</HI> barrs, here called <HI>bullet-Iron;</HI> the manner thus. He has a round <HI>Oven</HI> built of brick, not unlike those used by <HI>Ba∣kers</HI> at the top, having a grate in the bottom near the middle, about a foot and ½ or 2 foot wide, where he lays the <HI>coal;</HI> on each side whereof, and at the end beyond it, he lays his <HI>Iron</HI> inclosed in <HI>Cossins</HI> made of <HI>Amblecot-clay</HI> to keep it from <HI>melt∣ing;</HI> the <HI>Coffins</HI> being proportioned to the <HI>barrs</HI> of <HI>Iron,</HI> which are broken into <HI>lengths,</HI> of between 3 and 4, or 4 and 5 foot long; the longest being placed at the end of the <HI>Oven,</HI> and the shortest on each side; each <HI>Coffin</HI> containing about half a <HI>Tun</HI> of <HI>Iron.</HI> When the fire is put to it, it is constantly tended day and night till the operation is performed, which according to the goodness or badness of the <HI>coal</HI> is done in a longer or shorter time, sometimes in 3 days and 3 nights, other times in 4, and sometimes not under a weeks time, the <HI>critical-minute</HI> in which the operation is finisht being the great secret of the <HI>Art</HI> of mak∣ing <HI>Iron</HI> into <HI>steel.</HI> Which when done, they cut it into narrower barrs about half an inch over, &amp; then break it into short pieces of an inch, or two inches long, call'd <HI>Gadds,</HI> whereby the buyers may see whether it be good or bad (for there may be both in the same <HI>barr</HI>) otherwise they care not to buy it.</P>

<P N="78">78. But the greatest excellency of the <HI>Black-Smiths</HI> profession, that I could hear of in this <HI>County,</HI> lyes in their making <HI>locks</HI> for
<PB N="376" REF="251"/>doores, wherein the <HI>Artisans</HI> of <HI>Wolverhampton</HI> seem to be pre∣ferr'd to all others, where they make them in <HI>Sutes,</HI> six, eight, or more in a <HI>sute,</HI> according as the <HI>Chapman</HI> bespeaks them; whereof the <HI>Keys</HI> shall neither of them open each others lock, yet one <HI>Master-key</HI> shall open them all: so that these <HI>locks</HI> being set upon the doores of a house, and the <HI>inferior Keys</HI> kept by di∣stinct <HI>servants,</HI> tho' neither of them can come at each others <HI>charge,</HI> yet the <HI>Master</HI> can come at them all. Beside the <HI>Master</HI> turning his key in any of the <HI>Servants</HI> locks but once extraordi∣nary, the <HI>Servants</HI> themselves cannot come at their <HI>charge,</HI> neither shall the <HI>Servant</HI> spoil his key or the lock in endeavouring it; for his, after the <HI>Master-key</HI> has given the lock a second turn, will only run round in it backward and forward, without either stopping at, or prejudiceing it any thing. Nay so curious are they in <HI>Lockwork</HI> (indeed beyond all preference) that they can contrive a <HI>Lock,</HI> so that the <HI>Master</HI> or <HI>Mistris</HI> of a family sending a <HI>Servant</HI> into their <HI>Closets,</HI> either with the <HI>Master Key,</HI> or (if they permit an <HI>inferiour-Key</HI>) with their own, can certainly tell by the <HI>Lock</HI> how many times that <HI>Servant</HI> has been in, at any di∣stance of time; or how many times the <HI>Lock</HI> has been shot for a whole year together: some of them being made to shew it 300, 500, or 1000 times; nay one of the cheif <HI>Workman</HI> of the <HI>Town</HI> told me (might he have <HI>Workmans</HI> wages) he could make one should shew it to 10000 times.

<P N="79">79.

Also they cast in this Town, <HI>Iron, Copper,</HI> and <HI>brass potts</HI> of all sizes; in perfecting of which <HI>wares,</HI> as also of their <HI>spurs, bridles, stirrups,</HI> &amp;c. they use a great deal of <HI>Tin</HI> which they superinduce over them, to give a better <HI>luster,</HI> and preserve some of them from <HI>rusting;</HI> and prevent others from giving a <HI>tast</HI> of the <HI>Metalls</HI> to things boyled in them.</P>
<P N="81">81. For the performance whereof they use such <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>materials,</HI> as each <HI>Metall</HI> requires; viz. for <HI>Iron</HI> they proceed in this manner: they melt in a <HI>pan</HI> a parcel of <HI>Tin</HI> proportio∣nable to their <HI>work,</HI> and a ratable quantity of <HI>yellow Rosin</HI> mix't, which will swim above the <HI>Tin</HI> to the thickness of a <HI>Crown</HI> piece; into which, the <HI>wares</HI> being first soaked in old sharp
<PB N="378" REF="252"/>clarifyed <HI>Whey</HI> to cleanse them from all filth, and duely <HI>heated,</HI> and then dip't into this <HI>mixture</HI> and shaken about, by media∣tion of the <HI>Rosin</HI> they become <HI>Tin'd</HI> all over. And for <HI>tin∣ning</HI> other smaller <HI>brass</HI> commodities, they observe this <HI>method;</HI> they put them all together in an <HI>earthen pot,</HI> and heat them over the fire to a due proportion, then they put in a suitable quantity of <HI>Tin,</HI> to which when melted, they cast in as much as will suffice for the purpose of <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> or <HI>Armeniac</HI> (by the mediation whereof the <HI>brass</HI> admitts the <HI>Tin</HI>) which when shaken together the work is finish't, only they cast them im∣mediatly into a pan of <HI>cold water</HI> to wash off the <HI>faeces</HI> of the <HI>Sal Ammoniac,</HI> and to <HI>cool</HI> them quickly to preserve their colour, which they will not keep, if long in <HI>cooling.</HI> But in <HI>tinning</HI> greater <HI>brass Vessels</HI> such as <HI>potts, kettles,</HI> &amp;c. first they give the <HI>vessel</HI> its due heat, then they sprinkle the <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> in dust all over it, and then they apply a rod of <HI>Tin</HI> cold to it (the <HI>vessel</HI> being <HI>hot</HI> enough to melt it down) which when done in a proportionable quantity to the <HI>vessel,</HI> they then brush it all over it with <HI>hurds</HI> or combings of hemp (which licks not up the <HI>Tin</HI> as any thing else will) and the work is finish't.</P>
<P N="82">82. In <HI>tinning</HI> of <HI>Copper</HI> whether small or great <HI>vessels,</HI> they use the <HI>Methods</HI> as above, only instead of <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> they apply <HI>black-Rosin</HI> (which I am told is nothing else but the <HI>yellow</HI> refin'd) to unite the <HI>Metalls,</HI> with which they rub the <HI>vessel</HI> all over first, and then apply the <HI>tin,</HI> and so proceed <HI>ut supra.</HI> The matter of <HI>fact</HI> of which <HI>operations,</HI> viz. that the matters are so, all the <HI>Workmen</HI> know; but why these <HI>materials</HI> rather than any other, should performe these feats? is a <HI>Question</HI> perhaps that has scarce yet been proposed, much less determin'd: nor shall I pretend it. But if the <HI>Reader</HI> please to accept of a <HI>conjecture,</HI> till such time as he can meet with a more satisfactory account; let him take notice first, that <HI>Iron, Copper,</HI> and <HI>Brass,</HI> all hold <HI>Vitriols</HI> of their respective kinds, and that <HI>Tin</HI> is a very open po∣rous body and of a rough <HI>superficies:</HI> now as for <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> every body knows it to be an <HI>Alkali,</HI> and to seize upon <HI>acids</HI> where ever it finds them, and so likewise upon <HI>Tin,</HI> as is plain by the sublimation of <HI>Jupiter</HI> by it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Nich. Lemery's course of Chymistry. part. <HI>1.</HI> Chap. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE>; whence it seems very pro∣bable that the <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> unites the <HI>tin</HI> and <HI>brass,</HI> by seiz∣ing and destroying the <HI>Vitriol</HI> of <HI>Venus,</HI> and so inserting one end of its <HI>Chrystalls</HI> into the pores of the <HI>Brass</HI> where the <HI>Vitriol</HI> was, and the other into the open void pores of the <HI>Tin.</HI> In like man∣ner as the glutinous <HI>Rosins</HI> doe, which are nothing else but the sediments of Clarify'd <HI>Turpentine</HI> that also carry an <HI>Alcalizat Salt</HI>

<P N="83">83. And these are all the <HI>Arts</HI> that I found remarkable here, attending the <HI>Earths</HI> and <HI>Metalls:</HI> only that for preserving some of their finish't <HI>Iron-works</HI> from rust, such as <HI>Sword-hilts, Shoo-buckles, Armour,</HI> &amp;c. they use <HI>Litharge</HI> pounded and sear∣ced fine, mixt with <HI>oyle</HI> of <HI>Spike,</HI> and so layd on with a <HI>feather:</HI> or if they have occasion to lay by any of these <HI>curious wares</HI> for a considerable time, such as their curious thorough work't <HI>Keys, buckles,</HI> &amp;c. they commonly bury them in <HI>Lime</HI> powder'd, which being a strong <HI>Alcali,</HI> repells the relenting of the <HI>Vitriol</HI> of <HI>Mars,</HI> which seems to be the only thing that occasions this <HI>Metall</HI> to contract rust. Next these, I proceed to treat of such <HI>Arts</HI> as belong to <HI>plants,</HI> or the dependants on them, whereof the first that present themselves are those that concern the <HI>herbaceous</HI> kind. Of which sort we may reckon two ingenious <HI>contrivan∣ces</HI> and profitable ones also, that I met with in this <HI>County</HI> re∣lating to <HI>hemp</HI> and <HI>rushes,</HI> whereof they make <HI>ropes;</HI> which I found about <HI>Tamworth</HI> (especially those they had for their <HI>Wells</HI>) were not made of <HI>Hemp</HI> alone, but mixt with <HI>hair:</HI> the advan∣tage whereof above those of <HI>hemp</HI> only, they told me was this, that the ends of the <HI>hair</HI> sticking roughly out beyond the <HI>hempen</HI> strands, did so cast off the <HI>water,</HI> that these <HI>ropes</HI> were pre∣served from rotting, and lasted much longer, than any others did; which seems probable enough. And at <HI>Parke-hall</HI> in the parish of <HI>Caverswall</HI> I was shewn a <HI>rope,</HI> that past between the <HI>runners</HI> of the <HI>Oat-mill</HI> above mention'd § 10. made only of the <HI>pillings</HI> or rinds pull'd off the <HI>pith</HI> of the <HI>juncus laevis panicula sparsa major,</HI> or <HI>juncus laevis vulgaris</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid.

But the nicest piece of <HI>Art</HI> that ever I saw, any way re∣lating to the <HI>feather'd Kingdom,</HI> and indeed the most curious, was an <HI>instrument</HI> shewn me by the right Worshipfull S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Richard Astley</HI> of <HI>Pateshull</HI> Baronet, of his own Invention, only to match <HI>game-Cocks,</HI> discovering their <HI>sizes</HI> both as to lengh and girth, to so great an accuracy, that there cannot be easily any the least mistake: for the better apprehension of which <HI>Instrument</HI> I have here annext it <HI>Tab.</HI> 32. <HI>Fig.</HI> 6. with a <HI>Cock</HI> put in it at full stretch; where the Letter <HI>a,</HI> shews the <HI>Collistrigium</HI> or <HI>pillory,</HI> standing upon a <HI>pedestall</HI> fixt to the plate of brass below, 24 inches long, which opens by the handles at <HI>b,</HI> and shutts close of it self by the help of <HI>springs</HI> fastn'd within the <HI>ring; c,</HI> a hol∣low plate placed also upon a <HI>pedestall,</HI> but moveable in a groove 'twixt <HI>d</HI> and <HI>e,</HI> when drawn by the <HI>coard f,</HI> wound about the <HI>wheel g; h h,</HI> shew the <HI>Pedicae</HI> or <HI>stocks</HI> set also upon a movable <HI>pedestall</HI> opening and shutting as the <HI>pillory,</HI> which drawn out as farr as the length of the <HI>Cock</HI> will permitt, by the coard <HI>i,</HI> that is wound round the wheel <HI>k,</HI> by a <HI>key</HI> or <HI>winder</HI> applyed to the <HI>Axis l,</HI> (as the wheel <HI>g</HI> also is) both being stopt by the <HI>springs m m,</HI> which fall into the <HI>teeth</HI> of the <HI>wheels</HI> at <HI>no,</HI> give an exact measure of the length of the <HI>Cock</HI> to the <HI>eighth part</HI> of an <HI>inch,</HI> according to the <HI>divisions</HI> upon the latter part of the <HI>plate.</HI> Then for the <HI>Size</HI> of its <HI>body,</HI> it is measured by the <HI>girth,</HI> either by the <HI>brass ring</HI> described <HI>Fig.</HI> 7. which may be taken in, or let out, likewise to the <HI>eighth part</HI> of an <HI>inch,</HI> according to the <HI>divisions</HI> on the <HI>plate;</HI> or else by a <HI>Girdle</HI> and <HI>buckle,</HI> as may be seen upon the <HI>cock:</HI> all which have been approved by the best <HI>Masters.</HI></P>
<P N="95">95. Relating to <HI>four-footed beasts,</HI> they have a pretty <HI>device</HI> here, which I first espyed at <HI>Over-Bradnup,</HI> and near <HI>Ashenburst</HI> house (formerly the seat of an ancient <HI>family</HI> of the same <HI>name</HI>) to prevent their <HI>hogs</HI> from rooting; which they doe hereabout (and as I found after in most parts of the <HI>County</HI>) not with <HI>rings</HI> as elsewhere, but with a <HI>forked Iron</HI> armed at each end with a <HI>fin,</HI> or <HI>half-barb</HI> of an <HI>arrow,</HI> which being thrust through
<PB N="388" REF="257"/>the <HI>Selvedg</HI> of a <HI>hog's nose,</HI> can by no means return, the bottom or square part of the <HI>fork</HI> that lyes upon the <HI>nose</HI> being also coated with a hollow cylindraceous moveable <HI>ring</HI> as in <HI>Fig.</HI> 8. so that he cannot take hold enough to turn up the <HI>earth.</HI> I also met in this <HI>Country</HI> with another usefull <HI>experiment</HI> relating to this sort of <HI>Animals</HI> at <HI>great-Heywood,</HI> where I was shewn by M<SUP>rs</SUP> <HI>Whitby</HI> the virtuous wife of my worthy friend M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Whitby</HI> (whose <HI>assistance</HI> in this <HI>work</HI> I must ever acknowledg) the <HI>Runnet</HI> of <HI>Ranton</HI> (so call'd as they told me because thence they first had it) made of the innermost <HI>membran</HI> of a <HI>Calves Stomack</HI> or <HI>Mawe,</HI> which being wash't clean from all filth, salted, and hung up in brown papers, when they have occasion to use it, they only wash off the <HI>Salt,</HI> and steep a bit about the bredth of a shilling in 4 or 5 spoonfulls of fair water all night, and this <HI>water</HI> put to <HI>milk;</HI> will turn it to <HI>curds,</HI> which being so usefull a thing in <HI>houswifry,</HI> I could not but mention it.</P>
<P N="96">96. Another odd sort of <HI>Art</HI> I was told of in this <HI>County,</HI> which must not be omitted, of curing the disease in <HI>Cattle</HI> they here call the <HI>Foule,</HI> that proceeds as 'tis though from their ex∣cessive <HI>fatness,</HI> which sometimes falling into their <HI>leggs</HI> and <HI>feet,</HI> causes such <HI>impostumes</HI> or <HI>cores</HI> of putrifyed matter, that they cannot goe farr: upon which account tho' the <HI>beef</HI> of them be never the worse for the <HI>shambles,</HI> yet being rendered hereby uncapable of being brought to a profitable <HI>Market,</HI> their <HI>owners</HI> are therefore forced to have recourse to some <HI>remedy,</HI> which is commonly <HI>this.</HI> They stricktly observe the <HI>turf,</HI> where the <HI>Oxe, Cow,</HI> or <HI>Heifer</HI> that is thus distemper'd, sets his <HI>sick foot</HI> when he first rises in the morning, upon which they usually find some of the <HI>Sanies</HI> or matter of the <HI>impostume</HI> presst out by his weight; this very <HI>turf</HI> with the <HI>impression</HI> upon it, they cut up and hang upon a <HI>tree</HI> or <HI>hedg</HI> toward the <HI>North</HI> wind, which blowing up∣on it the <HI>beast</HI> becomes cured in three or four days: and this I was told about <HI>Tamworth</HI> was frequently practised there with good success to this day. Which as S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Kenelm Digby</HI> thinks seems indeed to be done, by a <HI>Sympathetic</HI> return of the <HI>Spirits</HI> of this im∣postumated matter, now mixt with the cold and dry <HI>Atoms</HI> of the <HI>North</HI> wind, to their first <HI>source</HI> in the ulcerated foot of the <HI>Animal;</HI> the <HI>malady</HI> indeed requiring no other help, than to be well dryed and refresh't, which is effectually doen by the cold nitrous particles of the <HI>Air</HI> coming from that <HI>quarter</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sr Kenelm Digbys discourse of Sympathetick powder, sub finem.</NOTE>. And these are all the <HI>Arts</HI> relating to <HI>quadrupeds</HI> worthy notice here, but that at <HI>Pateshull</HI> in the stables, I observed the <HI>Mangers</HI> were
<PB N="389" REF="257"/>somewhat extraordinary, being so placed that the <HI>range</HI> of them headed the end of the <HI>barn,</HI> whence the <HI>Oats</HI> might be put into them through <HI>tunnels</HI> in the partition, without bringing them round out of the <HI>barn</HI> into the <HI>Stable.</HI></P>
<P N="97">97. Lastly we come to the <HI>Arts</HI> that respect <HI>Mankind,</HI> amongst which as elsewhere the civility of precedence must be allowed to the <HI>women,</HI> and that as well in punishments as favours. For the former whereof, they have such a peculiar <HI>artifice</HI> at <HI>New-Castle</HI> and <HI>Walsall,</HI> for correcting of <HI>Scolds,</HI> which it does too so effec∣tually, and so very safely, that I look upon it as much to be pre∣ferr'd to the <HI>Cucking-Stoole,</HI> which not only endangers the <HI>health</HI> of the <HI>party,</HI> but also gives the <HI>tongue</HI> liberty 'twixt every dipp; to neither of which this is at all lyable: it being such a <HI>Bridle</HI> for the <HI>tongue,</HI> as not only quite deprives them of <HI>speech,</HI> but brings shame for the transgression, and humility thereupon, before 'tis taken off. Which being an <HI>instrument</HI> scarce hard of, much less seen, I have here presented it to the <HI>Readers</HI> view <HI>Tab.</HI> 32. <HI>Fig.</HI> 9. as it was taken from the original one, made of <HI>Iron,</HI> at <HI>New-Castle</HI> under <HI>Lyme.</HI> Wherein the Letter <HI>a,</HI> shews the joynted <HI>collar</HI> that comes round the <HI>neck; b, c,</HI> the <HI>loops</HI> and <HI>staples,</HI> to let it out and in, according to the bigness and slenderness of the <HI>neck; d,</HI> the joynted semicircle that comes over the <HI>head,</HI> made forked at one end to let through the <HI>nose;</HI> and <HI>e,</HI> the <HI>plate</HI> of <HI>Iron</HI> that is put into the <HI>mouth,</HI> and keeps down the <HI>tongue.</HI> Which being put upon the <HI>offender</HI> by order of the <HI>Magistrate,</HI> and fastned with a <HI>padlock</HI> behind, she is lead round the Towne by an <HI>Officer</HI> to her shame, nor is it taken off, till after the party begins to shew all external signes imaginable of humiliation and amendment. And as for any other <HI>Arts</HI> that concern this <HI>Sex,</HI> in one of the lodging rooms at <HI>Trentham Hall</HI> I was shewn a most delicate linnen suit of <HI>hangings,</HI> which being made by <HI>Nunns,</HI> and most artificially done, belong to this place, and must not be omitted; tho' I must confess my inability to describe them to that advantage they really deserve, the whole consisting all of <HI>square panes;</HI> some great, others little, yet pre∣serving uniformity; the one half plain, the other wrought in <HI>che∣que</HI> with a <HI>topiary</HI> sort of <HI>Needlework</HI> of so great variety, that it is hard (if at all) to find two alike, tho' they are in number great and small, as well as I could tell them, 3317 <HI>Squares.</HI></P>
<P N="98">98. As for the <HI>Arts</HI> relating to <HI>Men,</HI> it must not be expected that any great <HI>improvements,</HI> much less any new <HI>Inventions</HI> should have been made here in those we call <HI>Liberal:</HI> but amongst the <HI>Mecha∣nics,</HI> I met with several usefull and curious things: particular∣ly at a <HI>Smiths</HI> shop a little <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Mole-Copp,</HI> I found an Engine
<PB N="390" REF="258"/>that managed a large <HI>Sledg</HI> to so great advantage, that it frequent∣ly supplyed the defect of a man ordinarily had elsewhere for that purpose, the <HI>Sledg</HI> being set in an <HI>Axis</HI> of wood, from whence goes a rodd of <HI>Iron</HI> fastned to a <HI>pallet,</HI> that reaches out a little beyond the <HI>Anvil,</HI> which being drawn down by the foot of the <HI>Smith,</HI> who keeps time to it with his <HI>Hand-Hammer,</HI> is returned again by three <HI>springs</HI> of <HI>holly,</HI> that clasp the <HI>Axis</HI> the contrary way. The same I also found at <HI>Betley, Caverswall,</HI> and elsewhere, but some∣what different from that near <HI>Mole-Copp,</HI> the <HI>Sledg</HI> being return'd by two poles above it, like the <HI>pole</HI> of a <HI>turning-lat he,</HI> whereas the <HI>springs</HI> of the former were fastned below it. For the better un∣derstanding whereof, and because altogether unknown in the <HI>Southern</HI> parts, I have caused its <HI>figure</HI> to be exhibited <HI>Tab.</HI> 32. <HI>Fig.</HI> 10.

With which <HI>Engine</HI> I saw a <HI>Smith</HI> make a <HI>Horse-shooe,</HI> as they can also any o∣ther smaller sorts of <HI>wares,</HI> almost as quick as if another had struck the <HI>Sledg</HI> to him.</P>
<P N="99">99. In the <HI>Coopers</HI> trade at the right Honorable the Lord <HI>Wards</HI> at <HI>Dudley Castle</HI> I was shewn <HI>barrells</HI> in the <HI>Cellar</HI> having <HI>holes</HI> bored in the top of the <HI>head</HI> just under the <HI>rim</HI> of them, op∣posite to the <HI>tap</HI> holes, to let forth the <HI>working</HI> of the drink, which seems much better than that at the <HI>bung,</HI> the <HI>Spirits</HI> of the <HI>drink</HI> which naturally fly upward, being hereby preserved; scarce any of them passing with the <HI>froth</HI> through this <HI>hole;</HI> which when the <HI>drink</HI> has done <HI>working,</HI> is closed up with clay, as the <HI>bung</HI> usual∣ly is. And in <HI>Cookery</HI> at the Worshipfull <HI>Walter Chetwynds</HI> of <HI>Ingestre</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> I tasted potted <HI>Otter</HI> so artificially order'd by his excellent <HI>Cook,</HI> that it required a very nice and judicious <HI>palat</HI> to distinguish it from <HI>Venison.</HI> And now I am fallen in amongst the <HI>meats</HI> and <HI>drinks</HI> (which are no where better, or more plen∣tifull, than in this <HI>County</HI>) I cannot forget a piece of <HI>Art,</HI> that I found in the <HI>Hall</HI> of the right Honorable <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Paget</HI> at <HI>Beaudesart,</HI> made for punishment of the <HI>disorders,</HI> that sometimes attend feasting in <HI>Christmass</HI> time, &amp;c. call'd the <HI>finger-Stocks;</HI> into which the <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>misrule,</HI> used formerly to put the <HI>fingers</HI> of all such persons as committed <HI>misdemeanours,</HI> or broke such <HI>rules,</HI> as by consent were agreed on for the time of keeping <HI>Christmass,</HI> amongst the <HI>Servants</HI> and <HI>others</HI> of promiscuous quality: these being divided in like manner as the <HI>stocks</HI> for the <HI>leggs,</HI> and having several <HI>holes</HI> of different <HI>Sizes</HI> fit for the scantlings of all <HI>fingers,</HI> as represented in the <HI>Table Fig,</HI> 11.</P>

And yet the first thing that offers it self to my conside∣ration, is the <HI>original people</HI> that inhabited this <HI>Country</HI> before the coming of the <HI>Romans:</HI> I know both <HI>Ptolomy</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Cam∣den</HI> joyntly agree, that they were the <HI>Cornavii</HI> that were spread over <HI>this,</HI> and <HI>Warwic, Worcester, Salop,</HI> and <HI>Cheshires:</HI> but <HI>Ta∣citus</HI> mentioning a <HI>British</HI> people hereabout that were call'd <HI>Iceni,</HI> who took distast at the <HI>Propraetor Ostorius Scapula</HI>'s block∣ing up their <HI>Country-men</HI> between the Rivers <HI>Antona</HI> and <HI>Sabri∣na</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Corn.

Beside it seems pretty proba∣ble that these <HI>Iceni,</HI> were neighbours to the <HI>Congi</HI> or <HI>Cangi,</HI> a∣gainst whom the <HI>Roman</HI> Army was presently lead after the defeat of the <HI>Iceni,</HI> whose Territories reached, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> himself also confesses, almost to the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Corn.

But that which moves me most to think there was such a people as the <HI>Iceni</HI> both in <HI>Worcestershire</HI> and <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> is the <HI>Roman Consular way</HI> which remains to this hour, and passes through both those <HI>Counties</HI> by the name of <HI>Ickenild-street,</HI> which how it should come by, but from the people whose Territories it was made through, I cannot imagine. If it be objected that the <HI>Iceni,</HI> which <HI>Tacitus</HI> there mentions, must needs be the same with those of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> &amp;c. for that at the same place he speaks of a <HI>Colony</HI> of veteran Soldiers posted at <HI>Camalodunum,</HI> a City of the <HI>Trinobantes</HI> next neighbours to the <HI>Iceni</HI> of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> &amp;c. to re∣press the rebell <HI>Britans</HI> upon all occasions, which were drawn out at that time against the <HI>Silures</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Corn. Taciti Annalium. Lib. <HI>12.</HI> cap. <HI>32, 33.</HI></NOTE>. I answer that if we may beleive <HI>Ptolomy</HI> there were two <HI>Camalodunums,</HI> one in the <HI>Coun∣try</HI> of the <HI>Trinobantes,</HI> and another in the Territories of the <HI>Cornavii</HI> or <HI>Cangi,</HI> about the South parts of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> whence he might much more probably draw out these Veteran Sol∣diers, being much nearer to the <HI>Silures,</HI> than from the <HI>Cama∣lodunum</HI> of the <HI>Trinobantes:</HI> not to mention that <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls that of the <HI>Trinobantes</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Camudolanum,</HI> and not <HI>Camu∣lodunum</HI> as he does that of the <HI>Cangi,</HI> which is more agreeable to <HI>Tacitus</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Claud.

Such a <HI>Rampire</HI> as this, I say, I could have easily believ∣ed it, there having been just such great stones found herea∣bout, as we read <HI>Caractacus,</HI> and other <HI>British</HI> Princes, were used to fortify withal: whereof I was told of one, that con∣tained 100 loads; another so great, that after 10 loads of stone were hewed off it, required 36 yoaks of Oxen to draw it, and made the great <HI>Cistern</HI> in the <HI>Mault-house</HI> at <HI>Wrottesley,</HI> which though left very thick both at bottom and sides, is yet so capacious, that it will wet 37 strike of barley at a time.

<PB N="395" REF="261"/>ways, put it I think out of doubt, that it must have been a <HI>City,</HI> and that of the <HI>Britans,</HI> for that I could hear of no name it ever had, nor have the Inhabitants hereabout any tradition concerning it, of any sort whatsoever, somewhat whereof would have certainly been preserved, had it either been <HI>Roman;</HI> or so late as either the <HI>Saxon,</HI> or <HI>Danish</HI> conquests of this <HI>na∣tion.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. And this is the only <HI>Antiquity</HI> that seems to have any pretence of ever having been a <HI>British</HI> habitation, unless the tradition concerning <HI>Willbrighton</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> viz. that the <HI>Romans,</HI> when they came against it, termed it <HI>Villam Britonum</HI> (which name it still keeps with little alteration) may pass for one: but there being no footsteps remaining of its ever being <HI>tenible,</HI> tho' it lyes high, I much question whether this tradition, have not been broached of late years, by some fond <HI>Etymologist.</HI> Tho' it cannot be deny'd that the <HI>Romans</HI> had indeed some action hereabout, there being a raised work here at <HI>Morton</HI> not farr off, which seems to be of their fashion; and no question the large <HI>Meere</HI> that lyes just below it, had its name of <HI>Aqualat [quasi aqua lata]</HI> from them; and the <HI>banks</HI> on the N.

But though I could certainly meet with no other places of <HI>habitation</HI> of the <HI>Britans,</HI> either fortify'd with great stones, or otherwise fenced; yet there are several <HI>fortifications</HI> made of <HI>earth,</HI> cast up into high <HI>banks,</HI> with <HI>entrenchments</HI> round them, in such manner and form as the places would best admit of, that may be presum'd to be theirs. For that the <HI>Britans</HI> did fortifie after this manner too, as well as with <HI>stones,</HI> we have also the testimony of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> who tells us that the <HI>Iceni</HI> above∣mention'd did chuse a place for fight, <HI>septum agresti aggere, a∣ditu angusto, ne pervius equiti foret,</HI> fenced with a bank of <HI>earth,</HI> having a narrow <HI>entrance,</HI> to keep off the <HI>horse</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Corn.

Above the uppermost of these they often meet with <HI>Roman</HI> mony, whereof I was shewn 3 pieces, one of <HI>Nero,</HI> another of <HI>Domitian,</HI> and a third so eaten with rust, that it could not be distinguisht. On the other side the way in a ground belonging to <HI>Chesterfield,</HI> there are also <HI>antiquities</HI> found in digging, amongst which they lately met with the pedestall of an antique broken <HI>pillar</HI> very well wrought, which lay pretty deep just on the brink of the way, and now re∣mains at the widdow <HI>Smiths</HI> in <HI>Chesterfield,</HI> where I took the draught of it, in order to be engraven, as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 33. <HI>Fig.</HI> 4.</P>

Beside these <HI>Basili∣cal</HI> or <HI>Consular</HI> ways there were others of like erection, tho' less extent, call'd <HI>Vicinales, quod in vicos ducebant;</HI> whereof I scarce met with any in this <HI>County:</HI> unless I may take leave to account the high paved way at <HI>Wootton</HI> near <HI>Eccleshall</HI> a part of one of these, which seems not to have been made by rea∣son of any wet or dirty way, it being raised between two o∣ther deep ways, which lye dry enough too.

<P N="19">19. But their being placed on <HI>Streetways,</HI> is not the only signe of <HI>Roman tumuli:</HI> for where we find <HI>Roman mony,</HI> or any of their <HI>instruments</HI> of warr within or near them, we have also reason to judg them cast up by the <HI>Romans,</HI> tho' remote from any of their <HI>Consular ways:</HI> for which reason I shall reckon the <HI>Low</HI> near <HI>Bushbury</HI> of <HI>Roman</HI> erection, a brass head of the <HI>bolt</HI> of a <HI>Catapulta</HI> having been found in a wood of that <HI>parish</HI> call'd the <HI>burchen Lesow;</HI> another of this kind was also found near <HI>Fetherstone,</HI> but in the parish of <HI>Brewood</HI> by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Huntbach</HI> in a ground call'd the <HI>Laches,</HI> and by him presented to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Wil∣liam Dugdale;</HI> a third in the biggest of the three <HI>Lows</HI> of <HI>Morridg;</HI> and a fourth at <HI>Handsworth,</HI> all of <HI>brass,</HI> and well enough represented by that one draught, <HI>Tab.</HI> 33. <HI>Fig.</HI> 5.

Up∣on which account I say I cannot but determin that at <HI>Bushbu∣ry,</HI> and those <HI>three</HI> upon the <HI>Morridg,</HI> to be <HI>Roman Lows;</HI> it being plain by these <HI>instruments</HI> that all those places, as well where <HI>Lows,</HI> as not, were sometime visited by the <HI>Roman mi∣litia,</HI> and places of some action.</P>
<P N="20">20. And so for the same reason the parish of <HI>Ilam,</HI> where was found near the spring call'd S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Bertram's</HI> well, an instru∣ment of <HI>brass,</HI> somewhat like (only larger than) a <HI>Lath-hammer</HI> at the edg end, but not so on the other, the forme whereof is

<P N="21">21. Whence it may reasonably be concluded, as also from some <HI>Roman</HI> mony that has been sometimes found in <HI>Dale-close</HI> 'twixt <HI>Okeover</HI> and <HI>Mathfield,</HI> and a <HI>Roman</HI> Urn dugg about 10 years agoe out of a bank in <HI>Church-towne</HI> field in upper <HI>Math∣field,</HI> &amp;c. that the <HI>Lows</HI> hereabout, may for the most part at lest be esteemed <HI>Roman:</HI> particularly <HI>Harlow-greave</HI> a little mile <HI>NW</HI> of <HI>Mathfield;</HI> and that other in a field near the left hand the way, as you pass between <HI>Mathfield</HI> and <HI>Ellaston</HI> near <HI>Colwich-common,</HI> without name; and another larger over against it, at the other end of the <HI>common,</HI> which they call <HI>Row∣low,</HI> perhaps the <HI>Sepulcher</HI> of some petty <HI>King, Rowlow</HI> import∣ing as much as <HI>Regale Sepulchrum.</HI> To these add the <HI>Low</HI> in <HI>Arbour-close,</HI> 2 or 3 bows shoot <HI>North-westerly</HI> from <HI>Okeover</HI> Chap∣pel; the 3 Lows upon the <HI>Weever-hills;</HI> and 3 others they call <HI>Queen-Low, Gallows knoll,</HI> and <HI>Castlow-cross;</HI> together with the <HI>Lows</HI> on <HI>Ribden, Reeden,</HI> and <HI>Cauldon</HI> hills; and so <HI>Cocklow</HI> and the rest near the town of <HI>Leek;</HI> those on the hills near <HI>Warslow;</HI> on <HI>Ecton</HI> hill; and another on a hill that is a Cow∣pasture betwixt <HI>that</HI> and <HI>Oncot:</HI> most of which upon examina∣tion, as well as those on the <HI>Morridg,</HI> have been found made of <HI>stones,</HI> and not <HI>gravel</HI> or <HI>earth,</HI> as usually elsewhere; which</P>

<P N="22">22. The <HI>Lows</HI> near <HI>Elford</HI> and <HI>Wiginton</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> must also be reckoned amongst the <HI>Roman tumuli:</HI> for the <HI>former</HI> of these being opened at my instance <HI>Octob.</HI> 7 and 8. <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1680. at the charge of the generous Madam <HI>Bows</HI> of <HI>Elford,</HI> there was found in it level with the surface of the ground a∣bout it, a moist <HI>blackish</HI> sort of <HI>earth</HI> without any mixture of gravel or stones, about 2 yards <HI>diameter,</HI> and a foot and half deep in the middle, lyeing much in the same form with the <HI>tu∣mulus</HI> it self, on the edg whereof, were <HI>Ashes</HI> and <HI>Charcoal</HI> in their true colours, and several pieces of <HI>bones</HI> in the middle of it, so friable that they would crumble betwixt the fingers: the Low it self which coverd these <HI>Ashes</HI> and <HI>black earth,</HI> being made of gravel mixt with pebbles, as the soil it self there about is, and so it was also under the said <HI>black earth.</HI> Whence it could not but be concluded that this <HI>tumulus</HI> must needs be <HI>Ro∣man</HI> (tho' there were no <HI>coynes,</HI> pieces of <HI>Ʋrns,</HI> or <HI>Armour</HI> found in it) the bodies buryed under it having been certainly <HI>burnt,</HI> which I do not find either the <HI>Saxons</HI> or <HI>Danes</HI> ever did after their arrival here, whatever they might before. Otherwise I should have thought they might have been cast up, about the year 755, when <HI>Ethelbald</HI> King of <HI>Mercia</HI> being invaded by <HI>Cu∣thred</HI> King of the <HI>West Saxons;</HI> met and fought him at <HI>Segeswald</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Florent.

<P N="23">23. Now the reason why such <HI>Lows,</HI> and <HI>warlike instruments,</HI> certainly <HI>Roman,</HI> are so often found remote from their <HI>military ways,</HI> was I suppose that the <HI>Natives</HI> drew them frequently off, and skirmish'd with them any where, as occasion presented:
<PB N="406" REF="268"/>upon which account too we find the <HI>Romans,</HI> to have pitch't their <HI>tents</HI> in places farr distant from their <HI>ways,</HI> as one may plainly perceive by the <HI>Valla</HI> that went round them, which, as <HI>Polybius</HI> and <HI>Vegetius</HI> both teach us, being often made <HI>square</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polybii Historiarum Lib. <HI>6.</HI> de Castrametatione. &amp; Flav.

Tho' it must not be denyed that the <HI>Saxons</HI> also <HI>fortified</HI> in a <HI>square</HI> form, as may be seen at <HI>Tamworth</HI> and divers other places, of which in due time, so that I must desire the <HI>Reader</HI> to take special notice, that I am not so positive, but I can yeild it possible they may be <HI>Saxon</HI> notwithstanding, cast up upon the frequent incursions of <HI>Canutus,</HI> or the neighbouring <HI>Saxons</HI> into the <HI>Mercian</HI> Kingdom, of which more anon: only I think that had they been made so <HI>late,</HI> we should have had some account of them, whereof because none, I have chose rather to place them in <HI>remoter</HI> times. However they give me a fair tran∣sition.</P>
<P N="24">24. To the <HI>Saxon antiquities,</HI> amongst which first of such as relate to the <HI>Heptarchy,</HI> in treating whereof I shall observe as near as may be the order of time, and therefore must begin with the History of <HI>Berry-bank</HI> (as they call it) near the village of <HI>Darlaston</HI> in the parish of <HI>Stone,</HI> where on the top of a hill there yet remain the ruins of a large <HI>Castle</HI> fortifyed with a double <HI>vallum</HI> and <HI>entrenchments</HI> about 250 yards <HI>diameter,</HI> the <HI>gate</HI> seeming to have been on the <HI>west</HI> part of it, where the side banks on each hand yet plainly appear: others fancy there was a second <HI>gate</HI> on the <HI>East</HI> side too, tho' I could not per∣ceive any probability for it: but on the <HI>South</HI> side there is a round conical hill, much like a <HI>tumulus,</HI> cast up higher than all the rest of the <HI>work.</HI> Which according to the tradition of the <HI>Country</HI> thereabout, was the Seat of <HI>Wlferus</HI> King of <HI>Mer∣cia,</HI> who murthered his two <HI>Sons</HI> for embracing <HI>Christianity,</HI> one at <HI>Stone</HI> hard by, and the other at <HI>Burston</HI> but a little fur∣ther
<PB N="407" REF="268"/>off: but I doe not so much depend upon that, as on what M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sampson Erdeswic</HI> asserts, <HI>viz.</HI> that he had seen an old <HI>writing</HI> relating to the foundation of the <HI>Priory</HI> of <HI>Stone</HI> that affirms as much<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Erdeswick's view of Staffordsh. in Darlaston.</NOTE>: which perhaps may be that of <HI>R. de Suggenhill</HI> and <HI>Petronil</HI> his wife, whereby they gave to the Church of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Mary</HI> and S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Wlfade</HI> of <HI>Stone, Messuagium juxta montem qui dicitur</HI> Wlferecester <HI>in territorio de</HI> Derlaston<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">D.

The next <HI>Antiquities,</HI> that follow in order of time, of <HI>Sa∣xon</HI> original, are <HI>Dudley Castle</HI> built upon a lofty hill, and so nam∣ed by one <HI>Dudo</HI> an English <HI>Saxon</HI> about the year of our Salva∣tion 700<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden's Britannia in Staffordsh.</NOTE>. the present prospect whereof was represented a∣bove <HI>Tab.</HI> 3. <HI>ad pag.</HI> 39. and an old fortification in the pa∣rish of <HI>Mear</HI> or <HI>Mere,</HI> that they call the <HI>Bruff</HI> (which perhaps may be only a corruption of <HI>Burgh</HI>) fenced at some places with a double <HI>trench</HI> and <HI>rampire,</HI> the <HI>agger</HI> above the <HI>trench</HI> seem∣ing at some places to have been made up with <HI>stone,</HI> the whole being of a very irregular form, according as the figure of the hill would admitt: over against this, on the heath, there is a place they call <HI>Camp-hills,</HI> where it is supposed there was an∣ciently
<PB N="409" REF="269"/>likewise a <HI>Camp,</HI> tho' no signes of it now; only there are two round hills which may pass for <HI>harrows,</HI> and many o∣ther longish hillocks like graves, in which form I find these <HI>Sepul∣chral monuments</HI> were also sometimes made<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ol.

About this time the place of <HI>Island</HI> where the Town of <HI>Stafford</HI> now stands, anciently call'd <HI>Bethnei</HI> (what was said of it before being only prophesy) began first to be inhabited, by S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Ber∣telline</HI> the son of a King of this Country, and Scholar to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Guth∣lac,</HI> with whom he tarryed till his death: after which, tho' now unknown to his Father, he begg'd this <HI>Island</HI> of him, where he led a <HI>Hermits</HI> life for divers years, till disturbed by some that en∣vyed his happiness, when he removed into some desert mounta∣nous places, where he ended his life<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Jo.

Near <HI>Alveton</HI> in this <HI>County</HI> upon a lofty situation, in the lands of the right Honorable <HI>Charles</HI> Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> a most noble <HI>encourager</HI> of this <HI>work,</HI> there still remains, near the <HI>Lodg,</HI> just such another <HI>fortress,</HI> as that near <HI>Mear,</HI> only much larger, which they call <HI>Bunbury,</HI> of no regular figure, encompas∣sed with a double and sometimes treble <HI>trench,</HI> according as the natural situation of the place, seems to have required, on the <HI>North, NW,</HI> and <HI>NE</HI> sides, all the rest being naturally inac∣cessible, the whole including about an hundred <HI>acres:</HI> which I doubt not to have been made by <HI>Ceolred</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> the suc∣cessor of <HI>Kenred</HI> abovementioned, when he was invaded (in like∣manner as <HI>Kenred</HI> by <HI>Osrid</HI>) in the seventh year of his raigne, by the potent <HI>Ina</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> in the year of <HI>Christ</HI> 716. <HI>Cujus anno septimo</HI> Ina <HI>Rex</HI> West-Saxiae, <HI>magno Exercitu congre∣gato contra</HI> Eum <HI>apud</HI> Bonebury <HI>strenue praeliavit.</HI> i. e. that in the seventh year of <HI>Ceolreds</HI> raigne, <HI>Ina</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> having rais'd a great Army fought him stoutly at <HI>Bonebury</HI> says the Abbot of <HI>Jourvall</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Joh.

<P N="30">30. Of what antiquity the Town of <HI>Tamworth</HI> may be, does not plainly appear, but it must certainly have been a place of some repute of very ancient times, tho' we hear nothing of it till <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 781. when the great King <HI>Offa</HI> granting lands in <HI>Sapie</HI> to the <HI>Monks</HI> of <HI>Worcester</HI> concludes thus — <HI>Hanc autem praescriptam vicissitudinem terrarum &amp; meae donationis pro domino libertatem, ego</HI> Offa <HI>Rex sedens in Regali palatio in</HI> Tamowor∣thige <HI>secundo die nativitatis Domini, concedens donavi An.</HI> 781.

Now if the <HI>Mercian</HI> Kings had their <HI>Palaces</HI> here so very early, it must needs have been a Town of some repute long before, and perhaps a <HI>fortify'd</HI> place; there still remaining a square trench call'd <HI>Kings-ditch</HI> of large extent, that in a man∣ner encompasses the whole town, beginning on the bank of the River <HI>Tame</HI> west of the <HI>Lady-bridg,</HI> and running up thence in a straight line till it comes <HI>NW</HI> of the Church, where there seems to have been a <HI>mount</HI> or a <HI>bastion</HI> somewhat higher than the rest of the work, in the angle where it joyns to the following line; which runns straight all along <HI>N</HI> of the Church till it comes <HI>NE</HI> of it, where another <HI>mount</HI> also in the angle; whence it runns again in a straight line to the banks of the <HI>Anker;</HI> inclos∣ing the town on the <HI>West, North,</HI> and <HI>East;</HI> the Rivers se∣curing it <HI>Southward:</HI> but whether these were made, before, af∣ter, or in the days of King <HI>Offa,</HI> is not easy to determine.</P>
<P N="31">31. Next <HI>Tamworth</HI> the most ancient place of any in the <HI>County,</HI> whereof there are any footsteps yet remaining, perhaps may be a large old fortification near the village of <HI>Billington</HI> in the parish of <HI>Bradeley,</HI> 300 yards diameter doubly entrench∣ed, as may be seen at divers places, tho' the outmost indeed be fill'd up in some: which I could willingly beleive to have been the place of battle, between Duke <HI>Wada</HI> and the rest of the murtherers of King <HI>Ethelred,</HI> and King <HI>Eardulf</HI> his successor; which <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>Westminister</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Matth.

Wherefore I shall take leave anon to make a∣nother <HI>conjecture,</HI> concerning the original of this <HI>fortification:</HI> and in the mean time proceed to the <HI>life, martyrdom,</HI> and <HI>bury∣al,</HI> of the young S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Kenelm King</HI> of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> the <HI>Scene</HI> where∣of seems to have layn in this <HI>County,</HI> of which in their order.

<P N="33">33. Now the <HI>antiquities</HI> that I find yet remaining upon the place relating to this <HI>History,</HI> are first, <HI>Cowbach</HI> otherwise <HI>Cow∣dale</HI> as <HI>Brompton</HI> calls it<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Loco supra citato.</NOTE>, so named from the <HI>Cow</HI> that at∣tended his grave, which remains a <HI>pasture-ground</HI> to this very day, being situate in a <HI>valley,</HI> under <HI>Warton</HI> hill, about half a mile N E of <HI>Clent</HI> Church, as most of the ancient men of the town agreed; there being now no <HI>thorn,</HI> nor had there been
<PB N="413" REF="271"/>any that I could learn, within memory; so that the exact place where he was buryed is now unknown: nor is there any Spring here, which as the <HI>Legend</HI> says immediatly gush't out where the body had layne, as soon a 'twas taken forth<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Locis supra citatis.</NOTE>; S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Kenelm's</HI> well being ½ a mile off, near the <HI>Chapell</HI> yet standing dedicated to him, in the parish of <HI>Hales-Owen</HI> and <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Salop;</HI> and not in the parish of <HI>Clent</HI> or <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Stafford;</HI> so that whether this be the true <HI>Cow-bach</HI> or noe, the <HI>Legend</HI> must be false: un∣less we shall say that the precincts of <HI>Clent</HI> are contracted since, and that the true <HI>Cowbach</HI> was, where the spring now is, in the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Salop:</HI> which if so, I have said to much of it already, it being without the <HI>pale</HI> of the <HI>History.</HI> However half a mile <HI>N N E</HI> of <HI>Clent</HI> Church or there about, there is a <HI>list</HI> of <HI>grass</HI> greener than ordinary, call'd S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Kenelms-furrow</HI> running up to the <HI>Knoll-hill</HI> a great length, that still remains both in the <HI>parish</HI> and <HI>County,</HI> the grass whereof indeed is somewhat more verdant and luxuriant than at other places, which they intend for the <HI>fur∣row</HI> made by the <HI>Oxen,</HI> which run away with the womans plow, and were never again heard of, who in contempt of the feast of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Kenelm</HI> would make them work on that day, loosing her Eyes into the bargain, as the <HI>Legend</HI> says<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Job.

I found also 3 <HI>Lows</HI> on <HI>Clent-heath,</HI> but these relate nothing to our former history, being raised as I guess on some <HI>conflict</HI> hereabout, when the <HI>fortifications</HI> were made on <HI>Whichbury-hill,</HI> not farr off them, but in the parish of <HI>Pedmoore</HI> and County of <HI>Worcester,</HI> which being <HI>extra oleas,</HI> I am not concern'd either when, or by whom they were made.</P>
<P N="34">34. Beside these, there are other <HI>Antiquities</HI> here that may be presumed to be <HI>Saxon,</HI> tho' there can be no particular account given of them, as there has of the former. Such as the old fortification on <HI>Kinfare</HI> edge of an oblong square figure, about 300 yards long, and 200 over, having an artificial <HI>bank</HI> cast up round it, fenced with a deep <HI>ditch</HI> on the <HI>N N E</HI> and <HI>S S W</HI> sides; the <HI>edg</HI> or <HI>hill</HI> on the other two sides being naturally inaccessible. Concerning which the tradition of the <HI>town</HI> is, that it was a <HI>Danish</HI> fortification: but the name seeming rather to make it a <HI>Saxon</HI> one, where some <HI>King</HI> was kill'd from cyne <HI>Regium</HI> and papan <HI>nutare, vacillare</HI> or <HI>obire</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<PB N="414" REF="272"/>and so that at the end of <HI>Kinfare</HI> heath, near the Lane lead∣ing to <HI>Enfield;</HI> there seems also to be another under <HI>Meg a fox∣hole;</HI> which tho' now all stone, may possibly have been for∣merly <HI>earth,</HI> now turn'd into <HI>stone</HI> by subterraneal heats; espe∣cially if that be true which is asserted from experiment by <HI>Ga∣briel Plat,</HI> viz. that if you half fill a <HI>Retort</HI> with <HI>brimstone, Sea∣coale,</HI> and other <HI>bituminous</HI> substances, and the remainder of the <HI>neck</HI> also half way with <HI>pure earth,</HI> and set it to distill with a temperate open fire, the <HI>earth</HI> will be <HI>petrifyed</HI> or turned to <HI>stone</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Gabr.

<P N="43">43.

Thirdly by the <HI>Danes</HI> they are call'd <HI>Rimstocks,</HI> not only because the <HI>Dominical Letters</HI> were anciently express't on them in <HI>Runick</HI> Characters; but also for that the word <HI>Rimur</HI> anciently signi∣fy'd a <HI>Calendar</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Olai.

<P N="50">50.

<PB N="424" REF="280"/>whereof immediatly in the account I am about to give of the reason of these things.</P>
<P N="51">51. Which that I may doe with all imaginable perspicuity, let it be noted first, that the <HI>Sun</HI> finishing its course, i. e. re∣turning to the same point in the <HI>Zodiac</HI> in 365 days, and 6 hours <HI>proxime;</HI> and the <HI>Moone</HI> in 29 days and 12 hours <HI>proxi∣me,</HI> the <HI>Moone</HI> must finish her course or pass through the <HI>Zodiac</HI> 12 several times in every common <HI>Iulian</HI> solar year; 29 days and ½, or 354 days, being so many times to be found in 365 days; and 11 days over. Now because it was not easy to de∣termine in the <HI>Calendar</HI> the half days of the <HI>Moons,</HI> there be∣ing as I said 29 days 1 from one <HI>New-Moone</HI> to another, it was thought convenient (to ballance the matter) to make the <HI>di∣stances</HI> betwixt the <HI>New-Moons</HI> to be interchangeably 29 and 30 days, and to place the <HI>golden numbers</HI> accordingly, the <HI>Months</HI> having 30 days being termed <HI>Menses pleni,</HI> and those but 29, <HI>Cavi;</HI> the <HI>Pleni,</HI> or <HI>Lunar Months</HI> of an <HI>even</HI> number of days, being ordinarily found in the <HI>Solar</HI> months that have <HI>odd</HI> days; and the <HI>Cavi</HI> or <HI>Lunar-months</HI> of <HI>odd</HI> days, in the <HI>Solar</HI> months of <HI>even</HI> days; according to the old verse.</P>
<Q>Impar Luna pari, par fiet in impare Mense.</Q>
<P><HI>January, March, May, July, September,</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> being the <HI>menses pleni; February, April, June, August, October,</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> the <HI>Cavi;</HI> upon account of which alternate reckon∣ing of the <HI>Lunar</HI> months, it comes to pass that all the <HI>figures</HI> on the <HI>Clogg</HI> (as I noted above) doe for the most part inter∣changeably stand at the distance of 30, and 29 days a∣sunder.</P>
<P N="52">52. It being thus fully agreed on, the <HI>Lunar months</HI> should consist of 29 and 30 days apiece, <HI>alternatim:</HI> that the times of the <HI>new-moones</HI> might be for ever stated, the <HI>Christians</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> as D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Newton</HI> tells us, <HI>An.</HI> 323, two years before the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Nice,</HI> observing that the <HI>new-moon</HI> next the <HI>Vernal Equinox</HI> was upon the 27<SUP>th</SUP> day of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> month <HI>Phama∣noth,</HI> answering to the 23<SUP>d</SUP> of our <HI>March,</HI> placed against that day (it being the first year of their <HI>observation</HI> of this <HI>Cycle</HI>) the <HI>golden Number,</HI> 1, and so again at 29 days distance, the same number, agaist the 26 day of <HI>Pharmuthi,</HI> answering to our 21 of <HI>April,</HI> that being the <HI>mensis cavus;</HI> and at 30 days di∣stance, the same again opposit to the 26 of the month <HI>Pha∣con,</HI> answering to our 21 of <HI>May;</HI> and so onward through the whole year<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Newton's Cosmograph.

Whence going on as before, and counting 4 for the <HI>golden number</HI> of the next year, it will be likewise found on <HI>Jan.</HI> 20, <HI>Febr.</HI> 18, <HI>Mar.</HI> 20, <HI>Apr.</HI> 18, <HI>May</HI> 18, <HI>June</HI> 16, <HI>July</HI> 16, <HI>Aug.</HI> 14, <HI>Sept.</HI> 13, <HI>Octob.</HI> 12, <HI>Nov.</HI> 11, <HI>Dec.</HI> 10. And thus, had the <HI>Lunar</HI> and <HI>Solar</HI> years been equal, the <HI>Rule</HI> had held on through the whole <HI>Decennovennal Cycle,</HI> without excep∣tion.</P>
<P N="54">54. But the <HI>Lunar</HI> falling short of the <HI>Solar</HI> year full 11
<PB N="426" REF="281"/>days, it must needs follow, that going on as above, and ta∣king 5 for the <HI>golden number</HI> in the <HI>third</HI> year from the set∣tlement by the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Nice,</HI> that the <HI>Moone</HI> must have fal∣len short thrice 11, or 33 days, so that the <HI>Lunar months</HI> being run so far backwards as to be almost out of the <HI>Solar months,</HI> to which they were reputed to belong; an <HI>Embolisme</HI> of 30 days or a full Month must needs be made somewhere this year, to bring matters in a tolerable posture again: and for this reason the number 5 is set before <HI>Jan.</HI> 9, <HI>Febr.</HI> 7, <HI>Mar.</HI> 9, <HI>Apr.</HI> 7, <HI>May</HI> 7, <HI>June</HI> 5, <HI>July</HI> 5, <HI>Aug.</HI> 3, <HI>Sept.</HI> 2, and also before the 2 of <HI>Octob.</HI> and not the <HI>first,</HI> that so there may be two <HI>Lunations</HI> together of 30 days, the same number 5 be∣ing set notwithstanding to the 31 of the same <HI>Octob.</HI> to make the <HI>Lunation</HI> to consist again of 29 days, and to the 30 of <HI>No∣vemb.</HI> instead of the 29, that so a <HI>Lunation</HI> of 30 may again succeed as it ought. In like manner in the 6 year (the golden number being 8) having gone through the 4<SUP>th</SUP> and 5<SUP>st</SUP> as com∣mon years, the <HI>golden number</HI> is set opposit to the 5 of <HI>Apr.</HI> which should have been upon the 4; and in the 9<SUP>th</SUP> year, the golden number 11 is set to the 2 of <HI>Febr.</HI> which should have been upon the <HI>first;</HI> and so as often as 30 days will arise out of the 11 supernumerary days in the whole <HI>Cycle</HI> of the 19 years.</P>
<P N="55">55. Now because these 11 days doe in 19 years amount to 209 days, there must needs be 7 <HI>Embolismal months,</HI> which by a kind of injection or interposition must be somewhere re∣ckon'd within the 19 years, whereof 6 may contain 30 days apiece (as will be found upon the <HI>division</HI>) and one 29 days; the years in which they are <HI>intercalated</HI> being stiled <HI>Embolis∣mal years,</HI> to distinguish them from the <HI>common years,</HI> which al∣ways contain 354 days, whereas 6 of these <HI>Embolismal years</HI> doe each of them take up 384 days; and the 7<SUP>th</SUP> (in which the 29 days are reckon'd) 383 days.

Thus having shewn the reason of the distribution of the <HI>golden number</HI> in general, it remains that I give a more parti∣cular account how it comes to pass, that the <HI>following golden number</HI> should be made by adding 8 to the <HI>preceding;</HI> and the <HI>preceding</HI> by adding, 11 to the <HI>following:</HI> for the first whereof, I take the reason to be, that in 8 <HI>Solar</HI> years, allowing to each 365 days and 6 h. which are 2922 days, there happen to be 99 <HI>Lunations</HI> wanting one day, 12 h. 41′. 15″ 9‴; upon which account after 8 years the <HI>Lunations</HI> doe not begin upon the same day they did 8 years before, but one day and ½ later, <HI>proxime;</HI> wherefore after every <HI>golden number</HI> through the whole <HI>Calendar,</HI> another is written next it which exceeds it by <HI>eight,</HI> to shew that after 8 years the <HI>New Moons</HI> will not fall upon those days, upon which the <HI>antecedent golden numbers</HI> are writ∣ten, but upon those to which the <HI>numbers</HI> are prefix't, that are made off them by <HI>eight.</HI> And because in twice 8 years, the twice 12 hours and odd minutes make another <HI>day</HI> and better, therefore the <HI>golden numbers</HI> are not always immediatly put after each other upon all days of the months, but every <HI>third</HI> day, for the most part, is left vacant for these twice 12 hours; so that every two <HI>golden numbers</HI> have ordinarily 3 days allowed them, otherwise the <HI>Lunations</HI> in each 16 years time, would be always anticipated one day at lest.</P>
<P N="58">58. And the reason why every <HI>preceding golden number</HI> is formed of the <HI>subsequent</HI> by adding 11 is, because in 11 <HI>Solar</HI> years, in which are 417 days, there are 136 <HI>Lunations</HI> and one day, 14 h. 8′. 47″. 4‴. for that in 136 <HI>Lunations</HI> there are re∣quired only 4016 days 3 h. 51′. 12″. 56‴. and therefore the <HI>New Moones</HI> after 11 years, fall not on the same days they did the said 11 years before, but one day and almost half another soo∣ner: upon which account before every <HI>golden number,</HI> is set a∣nother <HI>golden number</HI> that exceeds it by 11, to shew that after 11 years, the <HI>New Moons</HI> will not fall upon those days they did 11 years before, but sooner, <HI>viz.</HI> upon those to which the <HI>num∣bers</HI> are prefixt, that are made off them by the addition of 11. Whence <HI>Clavius</HI> concludes that <HI>Campanus</HI> and many others of the ancient <HI>Computists,</HI> did not rightly set two <HI>golden numbers</HI> before <HI>Decemb</HI> 2<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Christoph. Claevii Calendar. Gregor. cap. <HI>9. §. 8.</HI></NOTE> for that after 11 years the <HI>New Moons</HI> that fell upon that day (the <HI>golden numbers</HI> being 13 or 2) will neces∣sarily happen one day and near ½ sooner, as was shewn above; for evidence whereof, if these were rightly set, there must also be two other <HI>golden numbers</HI> put the day preceding, <HI>viz.</HI> 5
<PB N="429" REF="282"/>and 13. and so two more again for them, and so quite through the <HI>Calendar:</HI> so that every day that has any, must have two <HI>golden numbers</HI> as well as this, and two <HI>New Moones</HI> falling on it within the <HI>cycle;</HI> whereas no other day but this even by these <HI>Computists</HI> is allowed above one, and these sufficient too, to take up all the <HI>New-Moons.</HI> Upon which account I rather close with <HI>Clavius,</HI> and place the number 13 upon the first of <HI>De∣cemb.</HI> and 2 alone upon the second, as I find them upon se∣veral of these <HI>Cloggs,</HI> tho' not in that represented above, 13 in that being put down to the <HI>second,</HI> and 2 to the <HI>third,</HI> in which point I therefore count it defective, nor can I see any inconvenience that will follow hence, but that the <HI>Embolismal month</HI> (the <HI>golden number</HI> being 13) must then be reckon'd from <HI>Dec.</HI> 1. to the 31. as <HI>Clavius</HI> does<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Idem Calendar. Gregor cap. <HI>17.</HI></NOTE>, which perhaps may be none: but I forbear to lanch further into this controversy, having already I fear tired the <HI>Readers</HI> patience.</P>

And proceed next to the <HI>Inscriptions,</HI> issuing from the <HI>notches,</HI> to the right hand of them, some peculiar <HI>notches</HI> hav∣ing <HI>figures</HI> set against them on this hand too, but all of diffe∣rent kinds, and not repeated like the former: which though they are <HI>marks</HI> or <HI>symbols</HI> of the <HI>festival days,</HI> exprest after the <HI>Egyptian Hieroglyphical</HI> manner, <HI>non literis, aut syllabarum com∣positione</HI> as <HI>Diodorus</HI> tells us<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Diodori Siculi de Aegyptiacis Lib. <HI>4.</HI></NOTE> <HI>sed imaginum forma,</HI> not with Let∣ters or Syllables, yet they are not set at random, but all car∣ry with them a rational importance, some of them pointing out the <HI>offices</HI> or <HI>endowments</HI> of the Saints, before whose <HI>festivals</HI> they are put; others the manner of their <HI>Martyrdoms;</HI> and o∣thers only some eminent <HI>action</HI> or other <HI>matter</HI> some way relat∣ing to the <HI>Saint,</HI> or else the <HI>work,</HI> or <HI>Sport,</HI> in fashion about the time when the <HI>feast</HI> is kept.

Many such <HI>Sym∣bols</HI> there are too, for other festivals, which not being so con∣stantly the same as these are, but varying almost upon every <HI>Clogg,</HI> I forbear any further exposition of them; only adding that the marks for the greater feasts solemnly observed in the Church have a large point set in the middle of them, and another o∣ver against the preceding day, if <HI>vigills</HI> or <HI>fasts</HI> were observ∣ed before them.</P>
<P N="61">61. Thus having done with the <HI>Inscriptions</HI> on both sides the <HI>notches,</HI> it remains only that I shew what were the uses of each: for the former whereof (I mean the <HI>prime</HI> or <HI>golden number</HI>) its only use anciently before the birth of <HI>Christ,</HI> was to shew the times the <HI>New-Moons</HI> would happen: but after his death it was applyed by the <HI>Church</HI> to an <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> use, viz. to shew the true time of celebrating <HI>Easter,</HI> which it does to this day: that being to be esteemed the <HI>Paschal Moone,</HI> whose 14<SUP>th</SUP> day doth fall upon or after the <HI>Vernal Equinox,</HI> which in the days of the <HI>Nicene</HI> Fathers (as they were informed by the <HI>Astronomers</HI> of those times) was upon the 21 of <HI>March;</HI> or which comes to
<PB N="431" REF="283"/>the same purpose: that was to be reputed the <HI>Paschal Moone,</HI> whose <HI>Full</HI> fell not on, but next after the <HI>Vernal Equinox</HI> or 21 of March, on which day if <HI>Sunday,</HI> or else the next <HI>Sunday</HI> fol∣lowing, <HI>Easter</HI> was always to be observed. So that the years of the <HI>Moons Cycle</HI> being settled as above, no body had then, nor has now more to doe, to find the time of <HI>Easter,</HI> but to consult in their <HI>Ca∣lendars</HI> the <HI>golden number</HI> for the year within that compass, which shews the time of the <HI>Paschal New-Moone,</HI> and to count 14 from it; or to find out the next <HI>Full-Moone</HI> after the <HI>Ec∣clesiastical Equinox;</HI> upon which day if <HI>Sunday</HI> (as I said be∣fore) or the next <HI>Sunday</HI> after, <HI>Easter</HI> is to be kept. Whence it is that these numbers are sometimes call'd the <HI>Prime,</HI> because they doe <HI>indicare primas Lunas,</HI> and not only near <HI>Easter,</HI> but through the whole year; which was esteemed by our <HI>ancestors</HI> a thing of so excellent use, that they scrupled not to set them in the <HI>margins</HI> of their <HI>Calendars</HI> in characters of <HI>gold,</HI> whence they are stiled to this day, also the <HI>golden number.</HI></P>
<P N="62">62. But you will obiect perhaps and say, that upon observ∣ing of the <HI>New Moones,</HI> you find them not now to fall on those days the <HI>Prime</HI> does direct, but ordinarily four, and sometimes five days before; which is so great a truth, that in the <HI>Brevia∣ries</HI> and <HI>Missals</HI> corrected by <HI>Pius quintus,</HI> the primes are remov∣ed 5 days upwards<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Christoph.

Which remedy of <HI>Pius quintus,</HI> and the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> had been agreeable enough, had the use of the <HI>prime</HI> been only to find the <HI>Astronomical New Moones.</HI> But our <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> having not yet though fit, to alter the observation of <HI>Easter</HI> from the time appointed by the <HI>Nicene Councel,</HI> the <HI>primes</HI> cannot be so alter'd without great confusion, as the learned D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Wallis</HI> has shewed at large<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibidem. cap. <HI>8. §. 4.</HI></NOTE>, but must be still continued where they were then, and still remain on the <HI>Clogg:</HI> which now rather serve indeed, only for the ready finding of the <HI>Ecclesiastical New-Moones,</HI> than the <HI>Astronomical;</HI> tho' they may be computed too, only by reckoning them to fall about 4 days before; the <HI>Cycle</HI> of the <HI>Moone</HI> having so much anticipated the course of the <HI>Sun</HI> since the time of that <HI>Council.</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Dr. Wallis's Treatise concerning the Paschal Tables in the Books of Common Prayer M S.</NOTE>
<PB N="432" REF="284"/>Which I take to be all the use that the <HI>primes</HI> are put to; but that by the <HI>following</HI> numbers being made by adding 8 to the <HI>preceding,</HI> and the <HI>preceding</HI> by adding 11 to the <HI>following;</HI> they also understand that every <HI>following prime</HI> will be in use 8 years after the <HI>preceding;</HI> and every <HI>preceding</HI> 11 years after the <HI>following.</HI> And as for the <HI>Symbols</HI> on the right hand the <HI>notches,</HI> their only use is for finding the <HI>immoveable feasts</HI> (as the <HI>primes</HI> were cheifly for the <HI>moveable</HI>) as was hinted above.</P>

<P>JOHN <HI>By the Grace of God King of</HI> Castile <HI>and</HI> Leon, <HI>Duke of</HI> Lancaster, <HI>to all them who shall see or hear these our</HI> Letters <HI>greeting.

Being come to the Church, the <HI>Vicar</HI> reads them divine service, chusing <HI>Psalms</HI> and <HI>Lessons</HI> suitable to the occasion: the <HI>Psalmes</HI> when I was there <HI>An.</HI> 1680. being the 98.149.150; the <HI>first Lesson</HI> 2. <HI>Chron.</HI> 5. and the <HI>second,</HI> the 5. <HI>chap.</HI> of the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> to the 22 verse. For which service every <HI>Minstrel</HI> offered one penny, as a due always a paid to the <HI>Vicar</HI> of the Church of <HI>Tut∣bury,</HI> upon this Solemnity.</P>
<P N="72">72. Service being ended, they proceed in like manner as be∣fore, from the Church to the <HI>Castle-hall</HI> or <HI>Court,</HI> where the <HI>Steward</HI> or his deputy taketh his place, assisted by the <HI>Bayliff</HI> or his deputy, the King of the <HI>Minstrells</HI> sitting between them; who is to oversee that every <HI>Minstrell</HI> dwelling within the <HI>Ho∣nor</HI>
<PB N="438" REF="289"/>and making default, shall be presented and amerced: which that he may the better doe, an <HI>O yes</HI> is then made by one of the <HI>Officers</HI> being a <HI>Minstrel,</HI> 3 times, giving notice by direction from the <HI>Steward</HI> to all manner of <HI>Minstrells</HI> dwelling within the <HI>Ho∣nor</HI> of <HI>Tutbury, viz.</HI> within the <HI>Counties</HI> of <HI>Stafford, Darby, Not∣tingham, Leicester</HI> and <HI>Warwick,</HI> owing suit and service to his Majesties <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Musick</HI> here holden as this day, that every man draw near and give his attendance upon pain and peril that may otherwise ensue, and that if any man will be assign∣ed of <HI>suit</HI> or <HI>plea,</HI> he or they should come in, and they should be heard. Then all the <HI>Musicians</HI> being call'd over by a <HI>Court∣roll,</HI> two <HI>Juries</HI> are impannell'd, out of 24 of the sufficientest of them, 12 for <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> and 12 for the other <HI>Counties;</HI> whose <HI>names</HI> being deliver'd in <HI>Court</HI> to the <HI>Steward</HI> and call'd over, and appearing to be full <HI>Juries,</HI> the <HI>Foreman</HI> of each is first sworn, and then the residue, as is usual in other <HI>Courts,</HI> upon the holy <HI>Evangelists.</HI></P>
<P N="73">73. Then to move them the better to mind their duties to the King, and their own good; the <HI>Steward</HI> proceeds to give them their charge: first commending to their consideration the ori∣ginal of all <HI>Musick,</HI> both <HI>Wind</HI> and <HI>string Musick,</HI> the antiquity and excellency of both, setting forth the <HI>force</HI> of it upon the <HI>affections,</HI> by divers examples; how the use of it has always been allowed (as is plain from <HI>holy writ</HI>) in praysing and glori∣fying God; and the <HI>skill</HI> in it always esteemed so considerable, that it is still accounted in the <HI>Schooles</HI> one of the <HI>liberal Arts,</HI> and allowed in all Godly Christian <HI>Common-wealths;</HI> where by the way he commonly takes notice of the <HI>Statute,</HI> which reckons some <HI>Musicians</HI> amongst <HI>Vagabonds</HI> and <HI>Rogues</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Joseph Kebles Statutes at large. <HI>39.</HI> of Eliz. chap. <HI>4.</HI> §. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE>, giving them to understand that such <HI>Societies</HI> as <HI>theirs,</HI> thus legally founded and govern'd by <HI>laws,</HI> are by no means intended by that <HI>Statute,</HI> for which reason the <HI>Minstrells</HI> belonging to the Manor of <HI>Dut∣ton</HI> in the <HI>County Palatine</HI> of <HI>Chester</HI> are expressly excepted in that <HI>Act</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibidem.</HI> §. 10.</NOTE>. Exhorting them upon this account (to preserve their reputation) to be very carefull to make choise of such men to be <HI>Officers</HI> amongst them, as fear God, are of good life and con∣versation, and have knowledg and skill in the practise of their <HI>Art.</HI> Which charge being ended, the <HI>Jurors</HI> proceed to the <HI>Election</HI> of the said <HI>Officers,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> being to be chosen out of the 4 <HI>Stewards</HI> of the preceding year, and one year out of <HI>Stafford∣shire,</HI> and the other out of <HI>Darbyshire</HI> interchangeably: and the 4 <HI>Stewards</HI> two of them out of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> and two out of

<P N="74">74. The <HI>Jurors</HI> departing the <HI>Court</HI> for this purpose, leave the <HI>Steward</HI> with his <HI>assistants</HI> still in their places, who in the mean time make themselves merry with a <HI>banquet,</HI> and a noise of <HI>Musicians</HI> playing to them, the old <HI>King</HI> still sitting between the <HI>Steward</HI> and <HI>Bayliff</HI> as before: but returning again after a competent time, they present first their cheifest <HI>Officer</HI> by the name of their <HI>King;</HI> then the old <HI>King</HI> arising from his place, delivereth him a little white <HI>wand</HI> in token of his <HI>Soveraignty,</HI> and then taking a <HI>cup</HI> fill'd with <HI>Wine</HI> drinketh to him, wishing him all joy and prosperity in his <HI>Office.</HI> In the like manner doe the old <HI>Stewards</HI> to the new, and then the old <HI>King</HI> riseth, and the new taketh his place, and so doe the new <HI>Stewards</HI> of the old, who have full power and authority by virtue of the Kings <HI>Stewards</HI> warrant, directed from the said <HI>Court,</HI> to levy and di∣strain in any <HI>City, Town Corporate,</HI> or in any place within the Kings dominions, all such <HI>fines</HI> and <HI>amercements</HI> as are inflicted by the said <HI>Juries</HI> that day upon any <HI>Minstrells,</HI> for his or their of∣fences, committed in the breach of any of their ancient <HI>orders,</HI> made for the good rule and goverment of the said <HI>Society.</HI> For which said <HI>fines</HI> and <HI>amercements</HI> so distrained, or otherwise peaceably collected, the said <HI>Stewards</HI> are accountable at every <HI>Audit:</HI> one moyety of them going to the Kings Majesty, and the other the said <HI>Stewards</HI> have, for their own use.</P>
<P N="75">75. The <HI>Election,</HI> &amp;c. being thus concluded, the <HI>Court</HI> riseth, and all persons then repair to another fair room within the <HI>Castle,</HI> where a plentifull dinner is prepared for them, which being ended; the <HI>Minstrells</HI> went anciently to the <HI>Abbey</HI> gate, now to a little barn by the <HI>Town</HI> side, in expectance of the <HI>Bull</HI> to be turned forth to them, which was formerly done (according to the <HI>Custom</HI> above mention'd) by the <HI>Prior</HI> of <HI>Tutbury,</HI> now by the Earle of <HI>Devonshire:</HI> which <HI>Bull,</HI> as soon as his <HI>horns</HI> are cut off, his <HI>Ears</HI> cropt, his <HI>taile</HI> cut by the stumple, all his <HI>body</HI> smeared over with <HI>Soap,</HI> and his <HI>nose</HI> blown full of beaten pep∣per; in short, being made as mad as 'tis possible for him to be; after Solemn <HI>Proclamation</HI> made by the <HI>Steward,</HI> that all manner of persons give way to the <HI>Bull,</HI> none being to come near him by 40 foot, any way to hinder the <HI>Minstrells,</HI> but to attend his or their own <HI>safeties,</HI> every one at his perill: He is then forth∣with turned out to them (anciently by the <HI>Prior</HI>) now by the Lord <HI>Devonshire</HI> or his deputy, to be taken by them and none other, within the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Stafford</HI> between the time of his being turned out to them, and the setting of the <HI>Sun</HI> the same
<PB N="440" REF="290"/>day: which if they cannot doe, but the <HI>Bull</HI> escapes from them untaken, and gets over the River into <HI>Darbyshire,</HI> he remains still my Lord <HI>Devonshires</HI> bull: but if the said <HI>Minstrells</HI> can take him, and hold him so long, as to cutt off but some small matter of his <HI>hair,</HI> and bring the same to the <HI>Mercat</HI> cross in token they have taken him, the said <HI>bull</HI> is then brought to the <HI>Bay∣liffs</HI> house in <HI>Tutbury,</HI> and there coller'd and roap't, and so brought to the <HI>Bull-ring</HI> in the high-street, and there baited with doggs: the first course being allotted for the <HI>King;</HI> the second for the <HI>Honor</HI> of the <HI>Towne;</HI> and the third for the King of the <HI>Minstrells.</HI> Which after it is done, the said <HI>Minstrells</HI> are to have him for their owne, and may sell, or kill and divide him amongst them, according as they shall think good.</P>
<P N="76">76. And thus this <HI>Rustick-sport</HI> which they call the <HI>Bull-run∣ning,</HI> should be annually performed by the <HI>Minstrells</HI> only, but now a days they are assisted by the promiscuous multitude, that flock hither in great numbers, and are much pleased with it, tho' sometimes through the emulation in point of <HI>manhood,</HI> that has been long cherish't between the <HI>Staffordshire</HI> and <HI>Darbyshire</HI> men, perhaps as much mischeif may have been done in the triall be∣tween them, as in the <HI>Jeu de Taureau</HI> or <HI>Bull-fighting</HI> practised at <HI>Valentia, Madrid,</HI> and many other places in <HI>Spain</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fran.

<P N="82">82. In short, the <HI>History</HI> of this <HI>Church</HI> stands thus, as well as I can discover it from the <HI>Records</HI> of <HI>Lichfield</HI> and <HI>Dublin,</HI> viz. it was first given, as I said above, to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> by King <HI>Stephen;</HI> not long after being endowed with the lands mention'd in King <HI>Johns</HI> Charter, it was made <HI>Collegiat,</HI> having 4 <HI>Chappells,</HI> one whereof was strangely lost (viz. <HI>Capella de</HI> Ca∣noto, <HI>sive</HI> Cannock) <HI>tempore Episcopi</HI> Hugonis <HI>de Novant</HI> in the reigne of <HI>Hen.</HI> 2<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibidem. part. <HI>1.</HI> fol. <HI>114.</HI></NOTE>. and not recoverd till the 2 of <HI>Edw.</HI> 1<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. part. <HI>1.</HI> fol. <HI>31.</HI> latere. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE>. In the mean time being a free Chappel of the Kings, the <HI>advowson</HI> of it was settled by King <HI>John</HI> upon the Arch-Bishops of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and confirm'd to them by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the 4. <HI>temp. Edw.</HI> 1. the Arch-Bishops of <HI>Dublin</HI> collating the <HI>Prebends</HI> as often as they fell, and holding the <HI>Deanry</HI> themselves, upon account there was then no revenew annext to the <HI>Deanry,</HI> for the support of any other, they should give it to; in which posture it stood for 30 years: wherefore the said Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> upon the petition of the Arch-Bishop then being, by his <HI>Bull</HI> bearing date at <HI>Anagni</HI> (the place of his birth) <HI>Nov.</HI> 11. <HI>Pontif. sui An.</HI> 5. annext this <HI>Deanry</HI> to the Arch-Bishoprick for ever<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibidem. part. <HI>2.</HI> fol. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE>.
