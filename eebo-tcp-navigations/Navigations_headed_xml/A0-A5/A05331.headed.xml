<P>LO heere the first fruits, or rather the tender buddes and blossomes of my la∣bours. Which least in this their winterly sprouting they might perhaps by some bitter blasts of censure be frost-nipped, I humbly recommend to your Honora∣ble protection.</P>
<P>Most due they are onely to your selfe, being for the greatest part nothing else, but a large illustration of certaine southern voiages of the English, alreadie dedicated to your Honour. And at this time especially I thought they would prooue the more acceptable: in that the Marocan am∣bassadour (whose Kings dominions are heere most amplie and particularly described) hath so lately treated with your Honour concerning matters of that estate.</P>
<P>Vouchsafe therefore (right Honorable) according to your accustomed humanitie towards learning, to accept of this Geo∣graphicall historie, in like manner as it pleased your Honour not long since most fauourablie to take in good part those com∣mendable indeuours of my reuerend friend M. <HI>Richard Hakluyt:</HI> who out of his mature iudgement in these studies, knowing the excellencie of this storie aboue all others in the same kinde, was the onely man that mooued me to translate it.

<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>GIue me leaue (gentle Readers) if not to present vn∣to your knowledge, bicause some perhaps may aswel be informed as my selfe; yet, to call to your remem∣brance, some fewe particulars, concerning this <HI>Geographicall Historie,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> the au∣ther thereof.</P>
<P>Who albeit by birth a <HI>More,</HI> and by religion for many yeeres a <HI>Mahumetan:</HI> yet if you consider his <HI>Parentage, Witte, Education, Learning, Emploiments, Trauels, and his conuersion to Christianitie;</HI> you shall finde him not altogither vnfit to vndertake such an enterprize; nor vnwoorthy to be regarded.</P>
<P>First therefore his <HI>Parentage</HI> seemeth not to haue bin ignoble: seeing (as in his second booke himselfe testifieth) an Vncle of his was so Honorable a person, and so excellent an Oratour and Poet; that he was sent as a principall Ambassa∣dour, from the king of Fez, to the king of <HI>Tombuto.</HI></P>
<P>And whether this our Author were borne at Granada in Spaine, (as it is most likely) or in some part of Africa; certaine it is, that in naturall sharpenes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>Wit,</HI> he most liuely resembled those great and classicall authours, <HI>Pomponius Mela, Iustinus Historicus, Columella, Seneca, Quintilian, Orosius, Prudentius, Martial, Iuuenal, Auicen,</HI> &amp;c. reputed all for Spa∣nish writers; as likewise <HI>Terentius After, Tertullian, Saint Augustine, Victor, Optatus, &amp;c.</HI> knowen to be writers of Africa. But amongst great varietie which are to be found in the processe of this not able discourse, I will heere lay before your view one onely patterne of his surpassing wit. In his second booke therefore, if you peruse the description of <HI>Mount Tenueues,</HI> you shall there finde the learned and sweete <HI>Arabian</HI> verses of <HI>Iohn Leo,</HI> not being then fully sixteene yeeres of age, so highly esteemed by the Prince of the same moun∣taine, that in recompence thereof, after bountifull entertainment, he dismissed him with gifts of great value.</P>
<P>Neither wanted he the best Education that all <HI>Barbarie</HI> could affoord. For being euen from his tender yeeres trained vp at the Vniuersitie of <HI>Fez,</HI> in <HI>Gram∣mar, Poetrie, Rhetorick, Philosophie, Historie, Cabala, Astronomie,</HI> and other ingenuous sciences, and hauing so great acquaintance and conuersation in the kings court: how could he choose but prooue in his kinde a most accomplished and absolute man? So as I may iustly say (if the comparison be tolerable) that as <HI>Moses</HI> was learned in all the wisedome of the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> so likewise was <HI>Leo,</HI> in that of the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Mores.</HI></P>
<P>And that he was not meanely, but extraordinarily learned; let me keepe silence, that the admirable fruits of his rare <HI>Learning,</HI> and this Geographicall Historie among the rest may beare record. Besides which, he wrote an <HI>Arabian
<PB REF="3"/>
Grammar,</HI> highly commended by a great Linguist of <HI>Italie,</HI> who had the sight and examination thereof; as likewise a booke of the liues of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Phi∣losophers; and a discourse of the religion of <HI>Mahumet;</HI> with diuers excellent Poems, and other monuments of his industrie, which are not come to light.</P>
<P>Now as concerning his <HI>Emploiments,</HI> were they not such as might well be∣seeme a man of good woorth? For (to omit how many courts and campes of prin∣ces he had frequented) did not he, as himselfe in his third booke witnesseth, per∣sonally serue king <HI>Mahumet</HI> of <HI>Fez</HI> in his wars against <HI>Arzilla?</HI> And was he not at another time, as appeereth out of his second Booke, in seruice and honora∣ble place vnder the same king of <HI>Fez,</HI> and sent ambassadour by him to the king of <HI>Maroco?</HI> Yea, how often in regard of his singular knowledge and iudgement in the lawes of those countries, was he appointed, and sometimes constrained at diuers strange cities and townes through which he trauelled, to become a iudge and arbiter in matters of greatest moment?</P>
<P>Moreouer as touching his exceeding great <HI>Trauels,</HI> had he not at the first beene a <HI>More</HI> and a <HI>Mahumetan</HI> in religion, and most skilfull in the languages and customes of the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Africans,</HI> and for the most part trauel∣led in <HI>Carouans,</HI> or vnder the authoritie, safe conduct, and commendation of great princes: I maruell much how euer he should haue escaped so manie thou∣sands of imminent dangers. And (all the former notwithstanding) I maruel much more how euer he escaped them. For how many desolate cold mountaines, and huge drie, and barren deserts passed he? How often was he in hazard to haue beene captiued, or to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had his throte cut by the prouling <HI>Arabians,</HI> and wilde Mores? And how hardly manie times escaped he the Lyons greedie mouth, and the deuouring iawes of the Crocodile? But if you will needes haue a briefe iournall of his trauels: you may see in the end of his eight booke, what he writeth for himselfe. <HI>Wherefore (saith he) if it shall please God to vouchsafe me longer life, I purpose to describe all the regions of Asia which I haue tra∣uelled: to wit, Arabia Deserta, Arabia Petrea, Arabia Felix, the Asian part of Egypt, Armenia, and some part of Tartaria; all which countries I sawe and passed through in the time of my youth. Likewise I will describe my last voiages from Constantinople to Egypt, and from thence vnto Italy, &amp;c.</HI> Besides all which places he had also beene at <HI>Tauris</HI> in <HI>Persia:</HI> and of his owne countrey, and other <HI>African</HI> regions adioining and remote, he was so diligent a traueller; that there was no kingdome, prouince, signorie, or citie; nor scarcelie any towne, village mountaine, valley, riuer, or forrest, &amp;c. which he left vnui∣sited. And so much the more credite and commendation descrueth this woorthy Historie of his; in that it is (except the antiquities, and certaine other incidents) nothing else but a large <HI>Itinerarium</HI> or <HI>Iournal</HI> of his <HI>African</HI> voiages: neither describeth he almost any one particular place, where himselfe had not sometime beene an eie-witnes.</P>
<P>But, not to forget <HI>His conuersion to Christianitie,</HI> amidst all these his busie and dangerous trauels, it pleased the diuine prouidence, for the discouery and ma∣nifestation of Gods woonderfull works, and of his dreadfull and iust iudgements
<PB REF="4"/>
performed in <HI>Africa</HI> (which before the time of <HI>Iohn Leo,</HI> were either vtterly concealed, or vnperfectly and fabulously reported both by ancient and late wri∣ters) to deliuer this author of ours, and this present Geographicall Historie, into the hands of certaine <HI>Italian</HI> Pirates, about the isle of <HI>Gerbi,</HI> situate in the gulfe of <HI>Capes,</HI> betweene the cities of <HI>Tunis</HI> and <HI>Tripolis</HI> in <HI>Barbarie.</HI> Being thus taken, the Pirates presented him and his Booke vnto <HI>Pope Leo the tenth:</HI> who esteeming of him as of a most rich and inualuable prize, greatly reioiced at his arriuall, and gaue him most kinde entertainement and liberall maintenance, till such time as he had woone him to be baptized in the name of <HI>Christ,</HI> and to be called <HI>Iohn Leo,</HI> after the Popes owne name. And so during his abode in Italy, learning the <HI>Italian</HI> toong, he translated this booke thereinto, being before writ∣ten in <HI>Arabick.</HI> Thus much of <HI>Iohn Leo.</HI></P>
<P>Now let vs acquaint you with the Historie it selfe. First therefore from so woorthy an author, how could an historie proceed but of speciall woorth and conse∣quence? For proofe whereof, I appeale vnto the translations thereof into <HI>Latine, Italian, Spanish, French, English,</HI> and (if I be not deceiued) into some other languages; which argue a generall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the same. I appeale also to the grand and most iudiciall Cosmographer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Read pag. 58. of places vnde∣scribed by Iohn Leo.</NOTE> Master <HI>Iohn Baptista Ramusius,</HI> sometime Secretarie to the state of <HI>Venice,</HI> who in the Preface to his first vo∣lume of voiages, so highly commendeth it to learned <HI>Fracastoro,</HI> and placeth it euery word in the very forefront of his discourses, as the principal &amp; most praise∣woorthy of thē all. And were renoumed <HI>Ortelius</HI> aliue, I would vnder correction report me to him; whether his map of <HI>Barbarie</HI> and <HI>Biledulgerid,</HI> as also in his last <HI>Additament</HI> that of the kingdomes of <HI>Maroco</HI> and <HI>Fez,</HI> were not particu∣larly and from point to point framed out of this present relation, which he also in two places at the least preferreth farre before all other histories written of <HI>Afri∣ca.</HI> But to leaue the testimonies of others, and to come neerer to the matter it selfe; like as our prime and peerelesse English Antiquarie master <HI>William Camden</HI> in his learned <HI>Britannia,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exactly described <HI>England, Scot∣land, Ireland,</HI> and the isles adiacent (the which by <HI>Leander</HI> for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> by <HI>Da∣mianus a Goez</HI> briefly for <HI>Spaine,</HI> by <HI>Belforest</HI> for <HI>France,</HI> by <HI>Munster</HI> for vpper <HI>Germanie,</HI> by <HI>Guiccardini</HI> for the <HI>Netherlandes,</HI> and by others for other countries hath beene performed) so likewise this our author <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> in the historie ensuing hath so largely, particularly, and methodically deciphered the countries of <HI>Barbarie, Numidia, Libya, The land of Negros,</HI> and the hither part of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as (I take it) neuer any writer either before or since his time hath done. For if you shall throughly consider him, what kingdome, prouince, citie, towne, village, mountaine, vallie, riuer; yea, what temple, college, hospi∣tall, bath-stoue, Inne; or what other memorable matter doth he omit? So doth he most iudicially describe the temperature of the climate, and the nature of the soile, as also the dispositions, manners, rites, customes, and most ancient pedi∣grees of the inhabitants, togither with the alterations of religion and estate, the conquests and ouerthrowes of the <HI>Romaines, Goths,</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> and other things (by the way) right woorthie the obseruation. So that the
<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>Africans</HI> may iustly say to him, and the <HI>English</HI> to master <HI>Camden,</HI> as the prince of <HI>Roman</HI> oratours did vnto <HI>Marcus Varro</HI> the learnedst of his nati∣on. <HI>Nos in patria nostra peregrinantes errantesque tanquam hospites, tui<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tull. Acad, quaest, lib.</NOTE> libri quasi domum deduxerunt, vt possemus aliquando, qui &amp; vbi essemus, agnoscere. Tuaetatem patriae, tu descriptiones temporum, tu sacrorum iura, tu domesticam, tu bellicam disciplinam, tu sedem regionum &amp; loco∣rum, &amp;c.</HI> Which may thus be rudely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>Wandring vp and downe like Pilgrimes in our owne natiue soile, thy bookes haue as it were led vs the right way home; that we might at length acknowledge both who and where we are. Thou hast reuealed the antiquitie of our nation, the order of times, the rites of our religion, our manner of gouernment both in peace and warre, yea thou hast described the situations of countries and places, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now as concerning the additions before and after this <HI>Geographicall His∣torie;</HI> hauing had some spare-howers since it came first vnder the presse; I thought good (both for the Readers satisfaction, and that <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> might not appeere too solitarie vpon the stage) to bestowe a part of them in collecting and digesting the same. The chiefe scope of this my enterprize is, to make a briefe and cursorie description of all those maine lands and isles of <HI>Africa,</HI> which mine author in his nine bookes hath omitted. For he in very deed leaueth vntouched all those parts of the <HI>African</HI> continent which lie to the south of the fifteene kingdomes of <HI>Negros,</HI> and to the east of <HI>Nilus.</HI> For the manifestation whereof, I haue (as truely as I could coniecture) in the mappe adioined to this booke, cau∣sed a list or border of small prickes to be engrauen; which running westward from the mouth of <HI>Nilus</HI> to <HI>The streights of Gibraltar,</HI> and from thence south∣ward to the coast of <HI>Guinie,</HI> and then eastward to the banks of <HI>Nilus,</HI> and so northward to the place where it began; doth with aduantage include all places treated of by <HI>Leo,</HI> and excludeth the residue which by way of Preface we haue described before the beginning of his <HI>African</HI> historie. Likewise at the latter end I haue put downe certaine relations of the great Princes of <HI>Africa,</HI> and of the <HI>Christian, Iewish, Mahumetan,</HI> and <HI>Gentilish</HI> religions there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The Princes of greatest account either inhabiting or at least possessing large ter∣ritories there, are first The grand <HI>Neguz</HI> or Christian Emperour of <HI>Abassia</HI> or the higher Ethiopia, commonly called <HI>Presbyter Iohn</HI> or (as <HI>Zagazabo</HI> his owne<NOTE PLACE="marg">The varietie of this emperours names read in a marginall note Pag. 12. of places vndescribed by Iohn Leo.</NOTE> ambassadour would haue him) <HI>Pretious Iohn;</HI> but bicause <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the <HI>Ethiopick</HI> relation of <HI>Francis Aluarez,</HI> being the best that euer was written of those parts, he is continually named <HI>Prete Ianni,</HI> in imitation of him I also most commonly call him by that name. And so likewise though <HI>Zagazabo</HI> (for the more magnificent reputation of his prince) will haue his dominions called <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> yet with the consent of some approoued authors, and also to distin∣guish the country of this emperour from many other regions situate both in the higher <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and in the lower; I haue set it downe in my mappe, and in my discourses do most vsually speake thereof vnder the name of <HI>Abassia.</HI> The other great Princes intreated of in the said relations, are <HI>The K. of Spaine,</HI> The <HI>Tur∣kish Emperour,</HI> The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Xeriso, or Serifo.</NOTE> <HI>Xarifo</HI> otherwise called The <HI>Miramonin,</HI> or the king of
<PB REF="5"/>
<HI>Maroco Sus</HI> and <HI>Fez,</HI> and the emperour of <HI>Monomotapa.</HI></P>
<P>My methode in the discourse before <HI>Leo</HI> is, after a generall preface of <HI>Africa,</HI> to begin at the <HI>Red sea,</HI> where <HI>Leo</HI> endeth; and thence (as well in the descripti∣on of the maine lands, as of the isles by him vntouched) to proceed on southerly to the cape of <HI>Buena esperança;</HI> from which cape we returne toward the north, describing all along the westerne countries and isles of <HI>Africa,</HI> till we haue brought our whole descriptions to an end vpon the most southwesterly parts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Barbarie,</HI> where our author <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> beginneth his.</P>
<P><HI>Et quoniam</HI> (as one saith) <HI>turpe non est, per quos profeceris, agnoscere:</HI> my principall authors out of whom I haue gathered this store, are, of the ancienter note, <HI>Ptolemey, Strabo, Plinie, Diodorus Siculus, &amp;c.</HI> and amongst later writers, I haue helped my selfe out of sundrie discourses in the first <HI>Italian</HI> vo∣lume of <HI>Baptista Ramusio,</HI> as likewise out of <HI>Iohn Barros, Castanneda, Or∣telius, Osorius de reb. gest. Eman. Matthew Dresserus, Quadus, Isolario del mundo, Iohn Huighen van Linschoten,</HI> &amp; out of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> late voiages to the <HI>east Indies,</HI> and to <HI>San Tomé:</HI> but I am much more beholding to the hi∣story of <HI>Philippo Pigafetta,</HI> to the <HI>Ethiopick</HI> relations of <HI>Francis Aluarez,</HI> &amp; of <HI>Damianus a Goez,</HI> and beyond all comparison (both for matter and method) most of all, to the learned Astronomer and Geographer <HI>Antonius Maginus of Padua,</HI> and to the vniuersall relations written in <HI>Italian</HI> by G. B. B.</P>
<P>And heere, before I surcease, I must admonish the Reader of certaine faults escaped in some copies: as namely in the description of the isles in the Barbarian bay, <HI>Açotatado,</HI> for <HI>Açotado;</HI> in a marginall note ouer against the description of Tombuto in the seuenth booke of <HI>Iohn Leo, Money</HI> for <HI>Gold;</HI> in the relation of the Christianitie of Egypt, <HI>Hypostasis</HI> twise togither, in stead of <HI>Hypostases;</HI> and in the discourse of the Christianitie of Congo, <HI>Paulo Aquitino,</HI> for <HI>Panso Aquitimo.</HI> Other literall faults (if there be any) will not be hard for the Reader himselfe to amend.</P>

Of which few, the principall were <HI>Hanno</HI> a Carthaginian captaine sent by the gouernours of that common∣welth<NOTE PLACE="marg">When Africa was sailed round about.</NOTE> for discouerie of the saide lande, and one <HI>Eudoxus</HI> that fled from <HI>Pto∣lemaeus Lathyrus,</HI> the king of Alexandria.

<P>To omit <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> his etymologies of this name Africa; <HI>Festus</HI> will haue it to be deriued from the Greeke worde <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifieth horror or colde, and from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the particle priuatiue, as who shoulde say, Africa is a place free from all horror and extremitie of colde, bicause it lieth open to the heauens, and is sandie, drie, and desert. Others say that it is called Afri∣ca <HI>quasi Aprica,</HI> that is exposed and subiect to the scorching beames of the sunne, the most part there of lying betweene the Tropicks. <HI>Iosephus</HI> wil haue<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was called Li∣bya.</NOTE> it so called from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> one of the posteritie of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and others from <HI>Afer</HI> sonne to <HI>Hercules</HI> of Libya. But it was by the Greekes called Libya, bicause it was in old time conquered by <HI>Libs</HI> the king of Mauritania. In the holie Scriptures it is called Chamesis, by the Arabians and Ethiopians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and by the Indians Besecath.</P>
<P>In situation &amp; shape this land of Africa is almost an islle, being by a very<NOTE PLACE="marg">The situation and shape of Africa.</NOTE> small and narrowe neckland (passing betweene the Mediterran sea and the gulfe of Arabia, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the red sea) conioined to Asia, and in extension of

ground being almost twise as bigge as Europe, albeit for inhabitants it is not halfe so populous. Wherefore though in longitude from west to east Afri∣ca<NOTE PLACE="marg">A comparison betweene Afri∣ca and Europe.</NOTE> be shorter then Europe in some places, yet extendeth it so farre vnto the south, that Europe in that respect is nothing comparable vnto it: for Africa containeth almost seuentie degrees in latitude, whereas Europe stretcheth but fiue and thirtie degrees: moreouer Africa is more vniforme and spaci∣ous; but Europe is of a more distracted and manifolde shape, being in sun∣dry<NOTE PLACE="marg">The causes why Africa is so slenderly inha∣bited.</NOTE> places dispersed &amp; restrained by the sea. Howbeit notwithstanding Afri∣ca hath farre greater extension of ground then Europe, yet is it not so po∣pulous, nor so commodious to inhabite: for the lande of Africa is in many places vnhabitable; the principall causes whereof are, the scarcitie of water, the barrennes of the soile, being either couered with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sande, dust, or ashes, or else being subiect to extreme heate of the sunne: also there<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sandie seas in Africa.</NOTE> are certaine dangerous heapes of sande, which being raised by the winde, are driuen vp and downe like the waues of a tempestuous sea: In briefe, there are such abundance of venemous and hurtfull creatures, that for feare of them the land in some places can very hardly, &amp; in others by no meanes be manured or inhabited, be it neuer so fruitfull. Wherefore in diuers parts this region lieth waste and vnpeopled: howbeit where it is inhabited, it is exceeding fertile, and that especially in the north parts thereof, lying ouer against Europe, where (according to the report of many historiographers, and cosmographers) it was in ancient times abundantly furnished with in∣habitants: so likewise all the westerne coast betweene Cabo de buena espe∣rança, and Cabo Negro situate about nineteene degrees of southerly lati∣tude, containeth many plaines, hils, vallies, and other places most fruitfull and pleasant, it being there a continuall spring, and elsewhere also it is verie fertile, as it shall be declared more at large in the particular descriptions of each region.</P>
<P>The Equinoctiall circle doth in a manner diuide Africa in the verie<NOTE PLACE="marg">The position of Africa, accor∣ding to the hea∣uens.</NOTE> midst thereof; from whence it stretcheth not onely to each tropique, but al∣so twelue degrees almost beyond them both: wherefore the greater part is comprized betweene the saide Tropiques vnder the Torrid or burnt Zone, for which onely cause the ancient writers supposed it to be vnhabitable and desert in so many places: which indeed is much rather to be ascribed to the waste wildernesse, the barren and sandie soile, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of waters and fountaines. It comprehendeth therefore fully and perfecty the three first northerly climates, and so many and the like climates southerly; for it is situate betweene the eleuenth north Parallele, and the eleuenth Antiparal∣lele, or south Parallele, both which are equally distant from the Equinocti∣all on either side. But about either of the foresaid extremes, the longest day consisteth of fowerteene howers and one fourth part, and about the midst, of twelue howers exactly. Likewise as touching the longitude, Afri∣ca stretcheth from the Meridian vnder fower degrees to the Meridian vnder fower-score and two degrees of longitude, to wit, from Cabo Roxo, or the
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
Red cape on the west, to Cape Guardafu on the east side, betweene which two capes is the greatest bredth of Africa.</P>
<P>Africa hath too narrowe boundes allotted vnto it by <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> and cer∣taine<NOTE PLACE="marg">The boundes of Africa.</NOTE> others, for they disioine the greater part of Egypt and all Ethiopia there-from. Wherefore it is more conuenient in this behalfe to follow <HI>Pto∣lemey,</HI> and the late writers, limiting the same on the north with the Medi∣terran sea, and the streights of Gibraltar; on the east with the Red sea or the Arabian gulfe, and the small neckland of Asia passing betweene the Medi∣terran sea, and the said gulfe; on the south (at the cape of Buena esperança, where it endeth in forme of a wedge) with the maine Ocean partly called the Ethiopian sea, as being neere vnto the land of Ethiopia; and on the west, from the hither side of the Equinoctiall line, with the Atlantike Oce∣an, (called by <HI>Ptolemey Mare Occiduum,</HI> by <HI>Dionysius Hesperium,</HI> and part thereof by the Spaniards Mar del Norte) but beyond the Equinoctiall line it is bounded westward with the Ethiopian sea.</P>
<P>Africa hath very many and most exceeding great mountaines, the prin∣cipal<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mountaines of Africa.</NOTE> wherof is Mount-Atlas, whose tops of incredible height rising out of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount Atlas.</NOTE> the midst of sandy desertes, exalt themselues aboue the cloudes. This mountaine beginneth westward at that place, where it distinguisheth the Ocean by the name of Atlanticus: from whence by a perpetuall ridge, after many windings and turnings, it extendeth east toward the confines of E∣gypt: moreouer it is in most places rounde, hard to ascend, craggie, steepe, impassable, cold, barren, shadie, and euery where full of woods and foun∣taines, with cloudes alwaies houering about the tops thereof, being forlorn and desolate toward the Ocean, but ouer against<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The prouin∣ces of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Alger, Bugia, Constantina, and Tunis.</NOTE> Africa minor, most fertile, and abounding with plentie of corne and of thick woods which are clad with a kinde of mosse no whit inferior to silke.</P>
<P>The tops of this mountaine are couered with deepe snowes euen in the midst of sommer: and sometimes when the North winds blow any thing sharpe, the snow falleth in such abundance, that it hideth the trees growing vpon the sides therof, and is deadly both to man and beast.</P>
<P>Moreouer the fountaines which are here found, are so extreame cold in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extreme cold fountaines.</NOTE> the hottest of sommer, as if a man should dip his hand therein but for a short space, it would loose both life, sence, and motion. Besides Mount At∣las<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountaines called Os Picos <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: that is to say, sharpe pointed. Iohn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: Dec. 1. lib. 8. cap. 4.</NOTE> those mountaines likewise are very famous, which being situate on the south part of Africa, are called by the Portugales Os Picosfragosos: for by reason of their surpassing height and craggie cliffes it is impossible to skale them, and they are bare, forlorne, and destitute of all reliefe.</P>
<P>Likewise the cape commonly called Sierra Leonais as it were framed out of an exceeding high mountaine, which may be kenned a mightie di∣stance off: the top of this mountaine is continuallie ouershadowed with cloudes, which often send forth dreadfull thunder and lightening: where∣upon some think it to haue bin called by Ptolemey, and by Hanno of Car∣thage, The chariot of the gods.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<P>The mountaines of the moone also, knowen of old, and situate vnder the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lunae montes.</NOTE> Tropique of Capricorne, being very high and craggie, are inhabited by bar∣barous and sauage people, nere vnto which are valleis of such exceeding depth, as if they reached to the center of the earth. Likewise there are cer∣tain mountaines in Angola called Cabambe containing most rich siluer∣mines, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Also in Africa are certaine mightie lakes, which for their extension seem<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lake of Zembre, which by some others is placed vnder the Equinocti∣all.</NOTE> rather to be seas, the principal wherof called by some Zembre, being situate by a number of huge mountaines, and distant from the Equinoctial eleuen or twelue degrees to the south, containeth about fiue hundred leagues in compasse, out of which lake doe spring the famous riuers of Nilus, Zaire, and Cuama, and some affirme very strange sea-monsters to be therein.</P>
<P>Africa likewise hath many exceeding great riuers, as namely Nilus, Ni∣ger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The riuers of Africa.</NOTE> Senaga, Gambra, Zaire, Abagni, Tagassi, Coluez, Coauo, Cuama, and Maniche, or Rio del spirito santo, all which are in a manner of the same qua∣litie and disposition; for with their yeerlie in undations they doe most won∣derfullie fatten and enrich the soile of the territories adioyning. Nilus the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nilus.</NOTE> most famous riuer of the world, diuiding Egypt in the midst, and with his ouerflowes making it most fruitefull, continueth in his yeerely increase for∣tie daies, and forty daies in decrease; to wit, from the seuenteenth of Iune to the sixt of October: and this riuer after a mightie long course through E∣thiopia and Egypt, dischargeth his streames into the Mediterran sea. The riuer of Niger, running through the land of Negros, called of old (as Soli∣nus<NOTE PLACE="marg">Niger.</NOTE> supposed) by the naturall inhabitants Astabus, and (according to Mar∣molius) Hued Nijar in the Arabian toung, is now esteemed by Paulus Ioui∣us to be Gambra, and by Cadamosta the riuer of Senaga; but that both of them are deceiued, it is euident out of the description of Sanutus, who put∣teth downe the two foresaid riuers seuerallie, and thinketh Niger to be that which is now called Rio grande. This riuer taketh his beginning, as some thinke, out of a certain desert to the east, called Seu, or springeth rather out of a lake, and after a long race, falleth at length into the western Ocean. It increaseth also, for the space of fortie daies like Nilus, and is for so long space decreasing about the verie same time; by which inundation it bringeth such fruitfulnes vnto all the land of Negros (certain mountaines onely ex∣cepted) as no place in the world can be imagined more fertile. Senaga or Canaga, a most notable riuer, called, as some thinke, Baratis by Ptolemey, and for the length therof, and manifold strange creatures therein contai∣ned, comparable to Nilus, seuereth by his winding chanel the barren and naked soile, from the greene and fruitefull. Moreouer it maketh a separati∣on betweene nations of sundrie colours: for the people on this side are of a dead ash-colour, leane, and of a small stature; but on the farther side they are exceeding blacke, of tall and manly stature, and very well proportioned: howbeit neere vnto the riuer on either side, they are of a meane colour, complexion, and stature betweene both the aboue mentioned. It falleth
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
into the sea by two mouthes, the principall whereof is about a mile broad, vp into the which the sea entreth almost 60. miles. It springeth (according to <HI>Iohn Barros</HI>) out of two lakes (the greater whereof is now called the lake of Gaoga, but heretofore by <HI>Ptolemey Chelonidae paludes,</HI> and the lesser <HI>Ptole∣mey</HI> calleth <HI>Nubaepalus</HI>) as also out of a riuer named by <HI>Ptolemey</HI> Ghir. This riuer of Senaga hath great variety of strange fishes, and other creatures that<NOTE PLACE="marg">These two ri∣uers of Senaga and Gambra are not certain∣ly known, whe∣ther they be maine riuers of themselues, or branches and mouthes of Ni∣ger.</NOTE> liue in the water, as namely, sea-horses, crocodiles, winged serpents, and such like: neere vnto it also are great store of Elephants, wilde bores, lyons, and leopards. Gambra or Gambea a very great riuer, lying betweene Se∣naga and Niger, and esteemed by <HI>Sanutus</HI> to be that which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> called Stachir, fetcheth his originall from the lake of Libya, and from the foun∣taines which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> assigneth to the riuer of Niger: this riuer in greatnes and depth exceedeth Senaga, and hath many vnknowne riuers falling there∣into, and bringeth foorth all kindes of liuing creatures that Senaga doth. In the midst of this riuer standeth the Isle of Elephants, so called, in regarde of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The isle of Ele∣phants.</NOTE> great numbers of those beasts. The riuer Zaire beginneth out of the same lake from whence Nilus springeth: this being one of the greatest riuers of all Africa, and vtterly vnknowne vnto ancient writers, containeth at the mouth eight and twentie miles in bredth, hauing a very safe harbour for ships to ride in: also there are many and great Islands in the chanell there∣of, and sundrie riuers do fall thereinto, the principall whereof are Vumba, Barbela, Coanza, and Lelunda: in briefe, this riuer Zaire running through<NOTE PLACE="marg">These two ri∣uers of Cuama and Magnice (according to Philippo Piga∣fetta) spring both out of the great lake and are not bran∣ches of one riuer.</NOTE> the kingdome of Congo, disgorgeth it selfe into the maine Ethiopian sea. Out of the same lake, which is the very fountaine of Nilus, springeth ano∣ther notable and famous riuer, which after a long race toward the south and east, is diuided into two branches: the northerly branch, which is excee∣ding great (for it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fixe great riuers thereinto, and is nauigable for the space of seuen hundred miles) being properly called Cuama, and the other branch more southerly, which is verie great also, being named Ma∣nich or Magnice, or Rio del spirito santo.</P>
<P>The promontories, capes, or headlands of Africa be verie many, the most<NOTE PLACE="marg">The promonto∣ries or capes of Africa.</NOTE> famous and principal wherof are, The cape of Buena esperança, or good hope, Cabo verde, and Cabo de los corrientes. The cape of Buena esperan∣ça<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabo de buena esperanza.</NOTE> or good hope is the extreame southerly point of all Africa, being a most renowmed and dangerous promontorie, which in the yeere one thousand foure hundred nintie seuen was the second time discouered by Vasco da Gama at the commandement of Don Emanuel king of Portugal: this cape the mariners were woont to cal the lion of the Ocean, and the tempestuous cape, by reason of the ruffling and roring of the windes, which they found there for the most part very boisterons: for the sea thereabout is exceeding rough, by reason of the continual fury of the windes; neither will any naui∣gatours touch vpon the cape, except they be enforced by meere necessitie. Cabo verde or The greene head-land, is esteemed by some to be the same<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> calleth <HI>Promontorium Arsinarium,</HI> &amp; is compassed on either

side by the riuers of Senega and Gambra. Cabo de los corrientes, other∣wise<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabo de los cor∣rientes.</NOTE> called the cape of San Sebastian, stretcheth foorth it selfe right ouer against the south ende of the great Isle of Madagascar: it is a cape well knowne, by reason it is so dangerous to double, which the Moores durst not passe for a very long time.</P>
<P>And heere as concerning the strange beasts, fishes, serpents, trees, plants, and roots of Africa, as likewise touching the diseases, whereto the African people are most subiect; and the varietie of languages (excepting the Chal∣daean, Egyptian, Turkish, Italian, and Spanish toongs) which are now and haue beene of ancient times spoken in Africa; I refer the Reader to the first and last bookes of <HI>Iohn Leo,</HI> and to other places, where they are at large and purposely intreated of.</P>
<P>Moreouer this part of the worlde is inhabited especially by fiue princi∣pall<NOTE PLACE="marg">The inhabi∣tants of Africa.</NOTE> nations, to wit, by the people called Cafri or Cafates, that is to say out∣lawes, or lawlesse, by the Abassins, the Egyptians, the Arabians, and the Africans or Moores, properly so called; which last are of two kinds, namely<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diuersitie of religions in Africa.</NOTE> white or tawnie Moores, and Negros or blacke Moores. Of all which na∣tions some are Gentiles which worship Idols; others of the sect of Mahu∣met; some others Christians; and some Iewish in religion; the greatest part of which people are thought to be descended from <HI>Cham</HI> the cursed son of <HI>Noah;</HI> except some Arabians of the linage of <HI>Sem,</HI> which afterward passed into Africa. Now the Arabians inhabiting Africa are diuided into many seuerall kinds, possessing diuers and sundrie habitations and regions; for some dwell neere the sea shore, which retaine the name of Arabians; but others inhabiting the inland, are called Baduini. There bee likewise infinite swarmes of Arabians, which with their wiues and children, leade a vagrant and roguish life in the deserts, vsing tents in stead of houses: these are notable theeues, and very troublesome both to their neighbour-inhabi∣tants, and also to merchants: for which cause trauellers and merchants dare not passe ouer the African deserts alone, but onely in Carouans, which are great companies of merchants riding, and transporting their goods vpon their camels and asses: who go very strong, and in great numbers, for feare of the said theeuish Arabians.</P>

<P>Mauritania Tingitana, the most rich and beautifull couutrey of Africa,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mauritania Tingitana, be∣ing all one with the kingdomes of Maroco and Fez.</NOTE> so named of the citie Tingis, which we at this day call Tanger, was some∣times also (as <HI>Plinie</HI> witnesseth) called Borgundiana: moreouer others haue called it by the names of Mauritania Sitiphensis, Hispania Transfretana, and Hispania Tingitana: but <HI>Solinus</HI> termeth the same Mauritania inferior. The inhabitants were of old named by the Graecians Maurusij, and by the
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
Romaines Mauri, but the Spaniards at this present terme them Alarabes. In this part of Africa are now contained two stately kingdomes, namely the kingdome of Maroco, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the kingdome of Fez; both which are enuironed with the mountaines of Atlas, the Ocean and the Mediterran seas, and to the east with the riuer of Muluia.</P>

It containeth now (as I coniecture) the prouinces of Bugia, Constantina, Bona, and Mezzab. Howbeit at this present we vnderstande by Numidia that region which lieth betweene the mountaines of Atlas and the Libyan deserts, called by <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> and <HI>Marmolius</HI> Biledulgerid, or the lande of Dates, bicause this is the onely region for plentie of Dates, in all A∣frica.</P>

<P>The best moderne diuision of Africa, for these our times is to adde vnto the foure general partes, Barbaria, Numidia, Libya, and the land of Negros, set downe by Iohn Leo, three other generall partes to wit, Egypt; the inner or the vpper Ethiopia, containing Troglodytica, Nubia, and the empire of Prete Ianni; and the lower, or the extreme Ethiopia, stretching from the

<HEAD>Of the red sea.</HEAD>
<P>THe red sea called by others the Arabian gulfe, and the streight of Me∣cha, containing in length twelue hundred miles, and in bredth but one hundred, is deuided into three partitions or chanels; the middlemost whereof being called The large or deepe sea, is without danger nauigable both day and night, because it hath from fiue and twentie to fiftie fathomes water, especially from the isle of Camaran euen to Suez stāding at the very bottome of the gulfe: the other two partitions, which are the easterne and westerne extremities, are incumbred with so manie little isles and rockes, as it is impossible to saile ouer them but onely by day-light, and with most expert pilots, which are to be hired at a small island lying ouerthwart the<NOTE PLACE="marg">This isle I take to be Babel∣mandel.</NOTE> very mouth or entrance of the red sea; which the ancient kings of Egypt (if the report of <HI>Strabo</HI> be true) barred with a chaine, from the African, to the Arabian side. This sea is very skarce of fish; perhaps because there fall no ri∣uers thereinto, which with their fresh and sweete waters doe much delight and nourish the fish; and the strand or shore thereof is destitute of all greene grasse, herbes, or weedes. The portes and hauens of this sea are for the most part very dangerous and difficult to enter, by reason of the manifold win∣dings and turnings, which must be made, to auoide the rockes.</P>
<P>At the very head or North end of this gulfe, standeth Suez, which here∣tofore<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suez called of olde Heroum ciuitas, and Hazion Geber.</NOTE> seemeth to haue bin called Ciuitas Heroum, and in the times of <HI>Da∣uid</HI> and <HI>Salomon</HI> Hazion-Geber, from whence the fleetes of those partes
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
were sent to Ophir for golde and other rich commodities. Vnder the Egyp∣tian Ptolemeys and the Romans, this towne flourished exceedingly, by reason of the infinite quantitie of merchandize brought thither from the east Indies, and Arabia. But now it is nothing so frequented; partly in regard of the mighty concurse and traffique which Mecha draweth vnto it selfe, and partly by reason of the Portugales conueiance of spices and other Indian commodities about the cape of Buena esperança. At this present the great<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arsenale signi∣fieth a store∣house for mu∣nition, and for all necessaries to build, re∣paire, and fur∣nish a fleete.</NOTE> Turke hath there an Arsenale, with certaine gallies, for feare of the Portu∣gals aforesaid: against whome there haue bin dispatched from this place two greate fleetes, one for the assailing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and another for Ormuz. Howbe∣it because all the countries round about are vtterly destitute of wood, it is a matter of infinite charge to furnish foorth a fleete from hence; for they are constrained to fetch their timber as far as Caramania, partly by sea, and partly vpon camels backs. At this towne of Suez they haue no fresh water; but all their water is brought them from a place sixe miles distant vpon ca∣mels backs, being notwithstanding brackish and bitter.</P>
<P>The western shore of the Red sea is inhabited with people called in old<NOTE PLACE="marg">Troglodytae were a people that liued in caues vnder the earth to auoide the extrem heat, being deriued <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> time Troglodytae, which at this present do all of them yeelde obedience to the great Turke: who considering, that the fleets of the Portugales entered very often into the Red sea, and were there receiued by the subiects of Prete Gianni, and did him great domage; hath thereupon taken occasion not onely to conquer the Troglodytae, but also to wast and subdue a great part of Barnagasso, the most Northerlie prouince of the said Prete. So that the audacious attempts of the Portugales in those partes haue bred two most<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great part of Barnagasso subdued by the Turke.</NOTE> dangerous and bad effects; the one is, that the Arabians haue most strong∣ly fortified all their sea-townes, which before lay naked and without fortifi∣cation; the other, for that the Turke also hath bin occasioned thereby to make warre against the Prete. Wherefore they ought not to haue vnderta∣ken any such enterprise, but with full resolution and sufficient forces to ac∣complish the same: for lesser attempts serue to no other end, but onely to rouze and arme the enimie, which was before secure and quiet.</P>
<P>Neither is it heere to be omitted, that in the foresaide sea, a man can saile in no ships nor barks, but only those of the great Turke, or at least with his licence, paying vnto him for tribute a good part of the fraight. For this purpose he hath certaine Magazines or store-houses of timber, which is brought partly from the gulfe of Satalia, and partly from Nicomedia, and other places vpon the Euxin sea, vnto Rosetto and Alexandria; from whence it is afterward transported to Cairo, and thence to Suez.</P>
<P>This sea is called the Red sea, not in regard that the waters thereofbe all red, but (as some thinke) from certaine red rushes which growe vpon the shore: and (as others are of opinion) from a kinde of red earth which in sundry places it hath at the bottome: which earth dieth not the very sub∣stance of the water red, but by transparence causeth it (especially neere the shore) to appeere of that colour.</P>

<HEAD>Africa Troglodytica.</HEAD>
<P>THat sandie, barren, and desert part of Africa which lieth betweene Nilus and the Red sea, especially to the south of the tropike, was in old times inhabited by the Troglodytae, a people so called, bicause of their dwelling in caues vnder the ground. Along this westerne coast of the Red sea runneth a ridge of mountaines, which being an occasion that the in∣land riuers can not fall into the saide sea, they are forced to discharge themselues into Nilus. The foresaide mountaines and sea coast are now inhabited by Mahumetans, being partly Arabians, and partly Turkes: which not many yeeres ago haue attempted to saile that sea, and to inuade the regions adioining. The naturall inhabitants are a rude barbarous peo∣ple, and very poore and beggerly. The chiefe places of habitation are Co∣rondol, a speciall good porte; Alcosser a place well knowne, bicause that neere vnto it the saide mountaines open themselues, and giue passage to the bringing in of the fruits and commodities of Abassia; Suachen estee∣med one of the principall ports in all the streights, and being made by an island. Here resideth the Bassa of the great Turke, which is called the gouer∣nour of Abassia, with three thousand soldiers or thereabout.</P>
<P>Next followeth Ercoco the onely hauen towne of the <HI>Prete,</HI> lying ouer against the little isle of Mazua: and heere the mountaines make an other opening or passage, for transporting of victuals out of the lande of the saide <HI>Prete Ianni.</HI> From hence almost to the very entrance of the Red sea, the coast is at this present vninhabited, forlorne, and desert. Likewise from Suachen to Mazua is a continuall woode, the trees whereof are but of small woorth. Iust within the saide entrance standeth the towne and port of Vela, vnder the iurisdiction of the king of Dancali a Moore.</P>
<P>Vpon all this west shore of the Red sea, as likewise vpon the contrary east shore, scarcitie of water is the cause, why there are so fewe, and so small pla∣ces of habitation: and the people runne and flocke togither, where they may finde any pit or fountaine of water.</P>
<P>Some curious reader might here expect, because I haue nowe passed so neere the frontiers of Egypt, that I should make an exact description of that most famous and fruitefull prouince, and likewise of the great city of Alca∣ir, and of the inundation and decrease of Nilus: all which, because they are expressed in most orient &amp; liuelie colours by our author <HI>Iohn Leo;</HI> I should shew my selfe both iniurious to him, and tedious to all iudiciall readers, in anticipating and forestalling that, before the beginning of his booke, which he so neere the end doth in such large and particular wise intreate of.

<P>PAssing therefore westward from the Island of Siene, you enter into the prouince of Nubia, bordering on the west vpon Gaoga, eastward vpon the riuer Nilus, towards the North, vpon Egypt, and southward vpon the desert of Goran. The inhabitants there∣of called by <HI>Strabo</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, liue at this present (as <HI>Francisco Aluarez</HI> reporteth) a most miserable and wretched kinde of life: for hauing lost the sinceritie and light of the gospel, they do embrace infinite corruptions of the Iewish and Mahumetan religions. At the same time when the foresaid <HI>Aluarez</HI> was in Abassia, there came certaine messengers out of Nubia, to make suit vnto the <HI>Prete,</HI> that he would send them priests, and such persons as might preach and administer the sacraments vnto them. But he returned answere, that he coulde not in regard of the scarcitie of great cler-giemen in his dominions: The said messengers reported, that the Nubians had sent often to Rome for a bishop; but being afterward by the inuasions of the Moores and the cala∣mitie of warre, cut short of that assistance, they fell for want of teachers and ministers, into extreme ignorance of Christian religion, and by little and little were infected with the impious and abominable sects of the Iewes and Mahumetans. Some Portugals trauailing to those parts, sawe many churches destroied by the handes of the Arabians, and in some places the pictures of saints painted vpon the wals. They are gouerned by women, and call their Queene <HI>Gaua.</HI> Their principall citie called Dangala, and consi∣sting<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dangala the head citie of Nubia.</NOTE> of about ten thousand housholds, is a place of great traffike, bicause it is so neere vnto Egypt and the riuer Nilus. All their other habitations are villages and base cottages. Their houses are built of claie, and couered with strawe. The chiefe commodities of this region are rice, stone-sugar, sanders, iuorie, (for they take many elephants) as likewise abundance of ciuet, and golde in great plentie. The countrey is for the most part sandie: howbeit there are certaine mightie lakes, by the benefite whereof a great part of Nubia is watred and made fruitfull.</P>

So that all this great empire may containe in compasse sixe hundred threescore and two leagues, little more or lesse. It is refreshed and watered by two mightie riuers which conuey their streames into Nilus, called by <HI>Ptolemey</HI> Astaboras and Astapus, and by the naturall inhabitants Abagni and Tagassi; the first whereof taketh his originall from the lake of Barcena, and the second from the lake of Colue. Barcena lieth in seuen degrees of north latitude; &amp; Colue vnder the verie Equinoctiall. The first (besides Abagni) ingendereth also the riuer of Zeila: and the second (besides Tagassi) giueth essence to the riuer of Qui∣limanci. Between Abagni and the Red sea lieth the prouince of Barnagasso: betweene Abagni and Tagassi are the kingdomes of Angote and Fatigar; and more towards the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sinus Barba∣ricus, a mightie gulfe on the backeside of Africa, stret∣ching (as some will haue it) from 4. degrees of northerly to 17. of southerly latitude.</NOTE> bay of Barbarians, the prouinces of Adea and of Baru; and somewhat lower, that of Amara. In briefe, beyond the riuer of Tagassi ly the regions of Bileguanzi, and of Tigremahon.</P>
<P>The Abassins haue no great knowledge of Nilus by reason of the moun∣taines which deuide them from it; for which cause they call Abagni the fa∣ther of riuers. Howbeit they say that vpon Nilus do inhabite two great and populous nations; one of Iewes towards the west, vnder the gouernment of a mighty king; the other more southerly, consisting of Amazones or war∣like women; whereof wee will speake more at large in our relation of Mo∣nomotapa.</P>
<P>Throughout all the dominion of the <HI>Prete</HI> there is not any one city of importance, either for multitude of inhabitantes, for magnificent buildings, or for any other respect. For the greatest townes there, containe not aboue two thousand housholds; the houses being (cottage-like) reared vp with clay and couered with straw, or such like base matter. Also <HI>Ptolemey</HI> intreating of these partes, maketh mention but of three or foure cities onely, which he appointeth to the south of the Isle Meroe. Howbeit in some places vpon the frontiers of Abassia there are certaine townes verie fairely built, and much frequented for traffique.

Whereunto they made answere, that the power of their Neguz, or empe∣rour, consisted not in stone-walles, but in the armes of his people. They vse not ordinarily any lime or stone, but onely for the building of churches (saying, that so it becommeth vs to make a difference between the houses of men, and churches dedicated to God) and of their Beteneguz or houses of the emperour, wherein the gouernours of prouinces are placed to execute iustice.

The <HI>Prete</HI> absolutely gouerneth in all matters, except it be in ad∣ministring of the sacraments, and ordaining of priests. Hee giueth and ta∣keth away benefices at his pleasure; and in punishing offenders, maketh no difference betweene his clergie and laitie. The administration of their sacra∣ments is wholie referred to the Abuna or Patriarke. The <HI>Prete</HI> is lorde and owner of all the lands and possessions in his empire, except those of the church; which are in number infinite; for the monasteries of saint <HI>Anto∣nie</HI> (besides which there are none of any other order) and the colleges of the Canons and of the Hermites, togither with the parishes, are innumera∣ble. They are all prouided by the king, both of reuenewes and of orna∣ments.</P>
<P>They haue two winters and two summers; which they discerne not by colde and heate, but by rainie and faire weather. They begin their yeere vpon the 26. of August, and diuide it into twelue moneths, each moneth containing thirtie daies, whereunto they adde euery common yeere fiue daies, and in the leape yeere sixe, which odde daies they call Pagomen, that is, The end of the yeere. Their ordinarie iourneies in trauelling are twelue miles a day. The common harlots dwell without their townes, and haue wages allowed them out of the common purse: neither may they enter into any cities, nor apparell themselues, but only in yellow.</P>
<P>The soile of Abassia aboundeth generally with graine, and in especiall with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and all kindes of Pulse, but not so much with wheate; they haue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> likewise (not knowing how to refine it) and hony, and cotton-wooll, orenges, cedars, and limons, grow naturally there.

They are not destitute of Elephants, mules; lions, tygres, ounces, and deere. Their
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
owne countrey horses are but of a small size: how beit they haue also of the Arabian and Egyptian breed, the coltes whereof within fower daies after they be foled, they vse to suckle with kine. They haue great and terribles apes; and infinite sorts of birds; but neither cuckowes nor Pies, so farre as euer could bee learned. Heere are likewise great store of mines of gold, sil∣uer, iron, and copper; but they know not how to digge and refine the same: for the people of this countrey are so rude and ignorant, that they haue no knowledge nor vse of any arte or occupation. Insomuch as they esteeme the carpenters or smithes craft for an vnlawfull and diabolicall kinde of sci∣ence; and such as exercise the same, liue among them like infamous per∣sons; neither are they permitted to enter into any of their churches. In the kingdome of Bagamidri are founde most excellent mines of siluer, which they knowe none other way how to take from the ore, but onely by mel∣ting it with fire into thinne plates. Goiame aboundeth with base gold. In the kingdome of Damut they digge and refine it somewhat better. They haue neither the arte of making cloth (for which cause the greater part of them go clad in beasts skins) nor yet the manner of hauking, fowling, or hunting; so that their countries swarme with partridges, quailes, fesants, cranes, geese, hens, hares, deere, and other like creatures: neither knowe they how to make any full vse or benefite of the fruitefulnes of their coun∣trey, nor of the commoditie of riuers. They sowe mill for the most parte, sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another, according as the raine giueth them opportunitie. In summe, they shew no wit nor dexterity in any thing so much as in robbery and warre; vnto both which they haue a kind of naturall inclination. Which is occasioned (as I suppose) by the continuall voiages made by the <HI>Prete,</HI> and by their vsuall liuing in the wide fields, and that in diuers and sundry places. For to trauaile continually, and remaine in the fields without any stable or firme habitation, compelleth men as it were, of necessitie, to lay holde on all that comes next to hande, be it their owne, or belonging to others.</P>
<P>They are not much subiect to tempests; but to an inconuenience far more intollerable, namely to innumerable swarmes of locusts, which bring such desolation vpon them, as is most dreadfull to consider: for they consume whole prouinces, leauing them quite destitute of succour both for man and beast. They vse no stamped coine in all this empire, but insteede thereof certaine rude pieces of golde, and little balles of iron, especially in Ango∣te; as likewise salt and pepper, which are the greatest riches that they can en∣ioy.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that the tributes which are payed to the prince, consist one∣ly of such things as his owne dominions do naturally afforde; as namely of salt, gold, siluer, corne, hides, elephants teeth, the horne of the Rhinoceros, with slaues, and such like. Which forme of tribute (being most agreeable to nature) is vsed also in other parts of Africa. Their salt is taken out of a cer∣taine great mountaine in the prouince of Balgada, and is made into square pieces.</P>

The most populous place in all Abassia is the court of the <HI>Prete,</HI> where∣soeuer it resideth; and there are erected fiue or sixe thousand tents of cotton of diuers colours, with so notable a distinction of streetes, lanes, market-places, and Tribunals; that euen in a moment euery man knoweth his owne station and the place where he is to doe his busines. A man may coniecture the greatnes of this courte, if he doe but consider, that (accor∣ding to the report of some who haue there bin personally present) besides the camels which carry the tents, the mules of carriage exceede the num∣ber of fiftie thousand. Their mules serue them to carry burthens, and to ride vpon: but their horses are onely for the warres. The Mahumetans haue now brought this prince to great extremity: but heretofore while he was in his flourishing estate, he liued so maiestically, that he neuer spake but by an interpreter; nor would be seene to his subiects, but onely vpon solemne dayes. At other times it was held as a great fauour, if he did shew but the halfe part of his feete to ambassadours, and to his fauorites. And no maruel: for amongst the Ethiopians it hath beene an ancient custome (as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth) To adore their kinges like gods, who for the most part liue enclo∣sed at home. This so strange and stately kinde of gouernment, did excee∣dingly abase his subiects, whom the <HI>Prete</HI> vsed like slaues; so that vpon the smallest occasions that might be, he would depriue them of all honour and dignity, were they neuer so great. Abassia containeth many large plaines, and very high mountaines, all fruitfull. In some places you shall haue most extreame coulde and frostie weather: but not any snowe throughout the whole empire, no not in the mountaines.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prete</HI> hath many moores in his dominions, and vpon his borders; but the most populous of all others are the Moores called Dobas, who are<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moores called Dobas.</NOTE> bound by a law neuer to marry, till they can bring most euident testimony, that each of them hath slaine twelue Christians.

<P>THe Ethiopian Emperour called <HI>Prete Ianni</HI> hath no setled place of abode where he continually resideth; but is alwaies flitting vp and downe, sometimes to one place, and sometimes to another, and liueth in tentes set vp in the fields, enuironed with a kinde of fortifica∣tion; of which tents there may be in his campe of all sorts to the number of 5000. or 6000; and of horse∣men and mules 50000. and vpwards.</P>
<P>It is a generall custome of the <HI>Prete</HI> and of all his subiects not to passe on horsebacke by any church (so great is their reuerence to holy places) but so soone as they approch thereunto, they light vpon the ground, and ha∣uing passed by, they mount on horsebacke againe.</P>
<P>Whensoeuer the <HI>Prete</HI> marcheth with all his troupes, there is carried before him vpon the shoulders of certaine priests an altar and a consecrated stone, whereon they vse to administer their communion: the priests ap∣pointed to cary it vpon a frame of wood, are eight in number, seruing fower and fower by turnes; before whom goeth a clerke with a censer and a little bell sounding; at the sight and noise whereof all persons forsake the way, and such as are on horsebacke, dismount.</P>
<P>In all this countrey there is not any towne consisting of aboue 1600. families, &amp; there are very few that haue so many: neither are there any castles or walled places; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manie villages, and infinite numbers of people. Their houses are built round, al of earth, flat-roofed, and couered with a kind of thatch which wil last the time of a mans life, being compassed about with courts or yards. They haue no bridges of stone vpon their riuers, but all of wood. They sleep commonly vpon oxe-hides, or else vpon certaine cou∣ches corded &amp; sustained with thongs made of the said hides. They haue no kind of tables to eat their meat vpon, but haue it serued in vpon plaine &amp; ve∣ry broad platters of wood, without any table-cloth at al. Also they haue cer∣taine great deep dishes like basons made of black earth shining in maner of Iet, with other cups of the same earth, out of which they vse to drinke water &amp; wine. Many of them eate raw flesh, but others broile it vpon the coles or
<PB N="21" REF="17"/>
firebrands: and some places there are so destitute of wood, that the people are faine to dresse their meate with oxe-dung.</P>
<P>Their armour and weapons be Azagaie or short darts, some few swords, and certaine shirts of male verie long and streight, and (as some of our men which haue seene them doe report) made of naughtie and vnseruiceable matter. They haue bowes and arrowes great store, but not with feathers as ours be: as likewise helmets and head-peeces, but very few, and first brought in since they began to haue traffique with the Portugals: howbeit they haue manie strong targets. Of artillerie they had<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1526.</NOTE> at our departure foureteene small yron-peeces, which they had bought of certaine Turkes that vsually came to trafficke vpon the coast; for which peeces the <HI>Prete</HI> willed that they should haue their vttermost demande, to the end they might be the willin∣ger to returne and bring more; and he caused some of his seruants also to learne how to discharge them.</P>
<P>The riuer of Nilus, I my selfe neuer saw, although at one time I was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philippo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will haue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to spring out of one great lake onely, which is to the south of Goiame.</NOTE> within thirtie miles thereof: howbeit some of our Portugales haue trauelled to the very fountaines of Nilus, which are two great lakes comparable to seas, situate in the kingdome of Goiame; out of which hauing conueyed it selfe a small distance, this riuer embraceth certaine Islets, and then holdeth on his course to Egypt.</P>
<P>The reason why Nilus yeerely ouerfloweth Egypt, is, because the gene∣rall<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true cause of the increase of Nilus.</NOTE> winter of Ethiopia holding on with most mightie and continual raines from the middle of Iune to the midst of September, doth make the said ri∣uer so exceedingly to swel, that the waters thereof couer al the plaine coun∣trie of Egypt.</P>
<P>In all the foresaid dominions of the <HI>Prete,</HI> they vse not to write one to another, neither do the officers of Iustice commit any of their affaires to writing, but all matters are dispatched by messengers and by wordes of mouth: onely it was told me, that the reuenues and tributes of the <HI>Prete,</HI> are put downe in writing both vpon the receite, and at the disbursement.</P>
<P>The emperour <HI>Prete Ianni</HI> hath two speciall princely names, to wit, Ace∣gue, which signifieth an emperour, and Neguz, a king.</P>
<P>The Patriarke or arche-prelate of all Abassia is called Abuna, that is to say, Father; neither is there any in all the whole empire which ordaineth mi∣nisters, but onely hee.</P>
<P>There is no wine of the grape made publiquely in any place, but onelie in the houses of the <HI>Prete</HI> and of the Patriarke; for if it be made anie other where, it is done by stealth.</P>
<P>The wine which is vsed in their communions, they make of raisins stee∣ped ten daies in water, and afterward streined in a wine-presse; and it is a most cordiall, delicate, and strong wine.</P>
<P>In this countrey is great abundance of golde, siluer, copper, and tinne, but the people are ignorant how to worke it out of the mines: neither haue they any coine of golde or siluer, but all their bargaines are made by
<PB N="22" REF="18"/>
bartering of one commoditie for another. Also they trucke little peeces of gold, some weighing a dram, and some an ounce. But salt is the principall thing which runneth currant for money throughout all the emperours do∣minions.</P>
<P>Some places there are which yeeld wheat and barly, and others millet in great plentie; and where the saide graines are not reaped, there groweth Tafo daguza, a seede vtterly vnknowne in these parts, as likewise lentiles, beanes, pease, fitches, and all kinde of pulse in abundance.</P>
<P>Heere are infinite store of sugar canes, which they know neither how to boile nor refine, but eate it rawe.</P>
<P>There be great plentie of faire grapes and peaches, which are ripe in the moneths of Februarie and Aprill. Of orenges, limons, and citrons, the quantitie is innumerable; for they growe most naturally out of the Abassin soile: garden-herbes there are but fewe, bicause the people delight neither to set nor sowe them.</P>
<P>All the whole countrey is full of Basill, which groweth very tall both in the woods and vpon the mountaines: so are there likewise other odorife∣rous herbes of diuers sorts, but vnknowen vnto vs. Of trees common with vs I remember none other kinds growing there, but onely Cypresses, dam∣sin-trees, sallowes by the waters side, and trees of Iuiubas.</P>
<P>Honie there is exceeding great plentie all the countrey ouer: neither are their bee-hiues placed abroad in the open aire as ours are: but they set them in chambers, where making a little hole in the wall, the bees go thicke in and out, and come home laden with honie. Wherefore there is great quantitie gathered in all the empire, but especially in the monasteries, where they make it a great part of their sustenance. There are founde also swarmes of bees in the woodes and vpon the mountaines, neere whom they place certaine hollowe boxes made of barke, which being filled with honi∣combes, they take vp, and carrie home to their houses.</P>
<P>They gather much waxe, whereof they make their candles, because they haue no vse of tallow.</P>
<P>They haue no oyle of oliues, but of another kinde which they call Hena:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oyle strayned out of an herbe.</NOTE> and the hearbe whereout they straine it, is like a little vine-leafe: neither hath this oyle any smell at all, but in colour it is as beautifull as gold.</P>
<P>Heere likewise they haue store of flax, but they know not how to make cloth thereof.</P>
<P>Here is also great plenty of cotton, whereof they make cloth of diuers colours.</P>
<P>One countrie there is so extreamely colde, that the people are inforced to clad themselues in very course cloth of a darke tawnie.</P>
<P>Concerning phisicke, and the cure of diseases, they know verie little or nothing; but for aches in any partes of their bodies the onely remedy which they vse is to apply cupping-glasses; and for head-aches they let the great vaine of the temples bloud.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="18"/>
Howbeit they haue certaine herbes, the iuice whereof being drunke, ser∣ueth them in steede of a purgation.</P>
<P>There would in this conntrie be gathered infinite store of fruit, and far greater quantitie of corne, were not the poore commons most miserablie oppressed by their superiours, who extorte all their substance from them; so that they neuer till nor plant any more, then they must of meere necessi∣tie.</P>
<P>In no place wheresoeuer I trauelled, could I see any shambles of flesh, but onely at the court of the <HI>Prete:</HI> for in other places no man may kill an oxe, though it bee his owne, without licence from the gouernour of the coun∣trie.</P>
<P>As touching their ordinary proceeding in iustice, they vse not to put<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Iustice.</NOTE> any to sudden death, but beate them with bastonados according to the qua∣lity of the offence, and likewise they plucke out their eyes, and cut off their handes and feete: howbeit during mine abode there I saw one burnt for rob∣bing of a church.</P>
<P>The common sort speake truth very seldome, though it bee vpon an oathe, vnlesse they be forced to sweare <HI>By the head of the King.</HI> They feare exceedingly to be excommunicated; so that being enioined any thing that tendeth to their preiudice, if they do it at all, it is done for feare of excom∣munication.</P>
<P>Their depositions or othes are performed in this manner. The partie to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their maner of swearing.</NOTE> be deposed goeth accompanied with two priests, carrying with them fire and incense to the church-doore, whereon he layeth his hande; and then the said priests adiure him to tell the truth, saying: <HI>If thou sweare falsly, as the lyon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the beasts of the forest, so let the diuell deuoure thy soule; and as corne is ground vnder the mill-stone, so let him grinde thy bones; and finally, as the fire burneth vp the wood, so may thy soule burne in the fire of hell:</HI> and the partie sworne, answereth to euery of the former clauses, Amen. <HI>But if thou speake truth, let thy life be prolonged with honour, and thy soule enter into Paradise with the blessed:</HI> and he againe answereth, <HI>Amen.</HI> Which being done, hee giueth testimonie of the matter in question.</P>
<P>No person may sit in their churches, nor enter into them with his<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ceremonies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their Churches.</NOTE> shooes on, nor spit within them, neither may any dogge or any other crea∣ture voide of reason come within them.

Where the Canons liue togither, they go each man to diet at his owne house; but the friers eate their meate in common.</P>
<P>Their ecclefiasticall gouernours are called Licanati. The sonnes of the Canons are, as it were by inheritance, Canons; but priests sonnes haue no such priuilege, vnlesse they be ordained by the Abuna. They pay no tithes
<PB N="24" REF="19"/>
to any churches, but the clergie are maintained by great possessions belon∣ging to their churches and monasteries. Also when any priest is cited, he is conuented before a secular iudge.</P>
<P>Whereas I saide, they sit not in their churches, it is to bee vnderstoode, that alwaies without the church doore stande a great number of woodden crutches, such as lame men vse to goe vpon; where euery man taketh his owne, and leaneth thereupon all the time of their diuine seruice.</P>
<P>All their books (which they haue in great numbers) are written in parch∣ment, for paper they haue none; and the language wherein they are written named Tigia, is all one with the Abassin language: but so it was called from the name of the first towne in all that empire, which was conuerted to the Christian religion.</P>
<P>All their churches haue two curtaines, one about their great altar, with belles, within which curtaine none may enter but onely priests: also they haue another curtaine stretching through the midst of their church, and within that may no man come, but such as haue taken holy orders: inso∣much that many gentlemen and honorable persons take orders vpon them, onely that they may haue accesse into their churches.</P>
<P>The greater part of their monasteries are built vpon high mountaines, or in some deepe valley: they haue great reuenues and iurisdictions; and in many of them they eate no flesh all the yeere long. Neither do they spende any store of fish, bicause they know not how to take it.</P>
<P>Vpon the wals of all their churches are painted the pictures of Christ, of the blessed virgine Marie, of the apostles, prophets and angels, and in euery one the picture of Saint George a horseback. They haue no Roodes, neither will they suffer Christ crucified to be painted, bicause they say, they are not woorthy to behold him in that passion. All their priests, friers, and noble∣men continually carrie crosses in their hands; but the meaner sort of peo∣ple carrie them about their neckes.</P>
<P>Their mooueable feasts, namely Easter, the feast of Ascension &amp; Whit∣sontide, they obserue at the verie same daies and times that we do. Likewise as concerning the feasts of Christmas, the Circumcision, the Epiphanie, and other the feasts of the saints, they agree whollie with vs, though in some other things they varie.</P>
<P>They haue great store of leprous persons, who are not put apart from the rest of the people, but liue in company with them: and many there are who for charitie and deuotions sake do wash them, and heale their wounds.</P>
<P>They haue a kinde of trumpets, but not of the best, and likewise certaine<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their musicall instruments.</NOTE> drums of brasse which are brought from Cairo, and of woode also couered with leather at both endes, and cimbals like vnto ours, and certaine great basons whereon they make a noise.

Their horses of the countrey-breed are in number infinite, but such small hackney-iades, that they doe them little seruice: howbeit those that are brought out of Arabia and Egypt are most excellent and beautifull horses: and the great horse-masters also in Abassia haue certaine breeds or races of them, which being new foled, they suffer not to sucke the damme aboue three daies, if they be such as they meane to backe betimes: but separating them from their dammes, they suckle them with kine, and by that meanes they prooue most sightly and gallant horses.

It hath also an excellent hauen, and much frequented by the ships of Aden and Cambaya, which come thither laden with sundrie kindes of cloth, with spices and other merchandize; and from hence they carrie ele∣phants teeth, golde, slaues, honie, and waxe. The inhabitants are of an oliue-colour, and some of them blacke, like vnto the nations adioining, and they go naked from the girdle-stead vpward, and speak the Arabian toong.

The inhabitants are for the most part black, with curled haire, being Idola∣ters, and much addicted to sorcery and witchcraft. They go naked all the vp∣per part of their bodies, couering their nether partes with clothes of diuers colours, and with beasts skins.

Melinde, the most Northerly kingdome of Zanguebar, situate in two de∣grees<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melinde the first part of Zanguebar.</NOTE> and an halfe of southerly latitude, and stretching from the coast vp into the main for the space of an hundred miles, hath a strong and stately city of the same name, being seuentie miles distant from Mombaça. It aboundeth with Rice, Millet, flesh, limons, citrons, and all kinds of fruites: but as for corne, it is brought hither out of Cambaya. The inhabitants (especially on the sea coast) are Moores and Mahumetans: who build their houses very sumptuously after the manner of Europe. They are of a co∣lour inclining to white, and some blacke people they haue also among them, which are for the greatest part Idolaters: howbeit all of them pretend a kinde of ciuilitie both in their apparell, and in the decencie and furniture of their houses. The women are white, and sumptuously attired after the Arabian fashion with cloth of silke. Likewise they adorne their neckes, armes, hands, and feete with bracelets and iewels of golde and siluer. When they go abroad out of their houses, they couer themselues with a vaile of taffata, so that they are not knowne but when they themselues list. Vpon this coast of Melinde you haue a very safe harborough, wherunto the ships that saile those seas do vsually resort. In briefe the inhabitants are a kind, true-har∣ted, &amp; trustie people, &amp; courteous to strangers.

Their kings are Mahumetans, and most deadly enimies to the Christians: one of the which taking vpon him to resist the Por∣tugals, was himselfe quite vanquished and ouerthrowen, and constrained to leaue his citie to the sacke and spoile of his enimies, who found therein a good quantitie of gold, siluer, and pearle; and likewise cloth of cotton, of silke, and of gold, with great numbers of slaues, &amp; such other commodities.

This island hath a very fresh and coole aire, and is replenished with trees alwaies greene, and with plentie of all kinde of victuals. It is situate at the mouth of the great riuer Coauo which springeth out of the same lake from whence Nilus floweth, and is called also by some Quiloa, and by others Tahiua,
<PB N="29" REF="21"/>
and runneth from the saide lake, eastward for the space of sixe hundred miles, till it approcheth neere the sea, where the streame thereof is so forci∣ble, that at the very mouth or out-let, dispersing it selfe into two branches, it shapeth out a great island, to the west where of vpon the coast you may be∣hold the little isle and the citie of Quiloa, being separated from the maine by a very narrow arme of the sea. This isle (as also the great isle before na∣med) is inhabited by Mahumetans, who are of colour whitish. Their wo∣men are comely, and rich in their attire. Their houses are fairely builte of lime and stone, and haue within them very gallant and costly furniture, and without they are enuironed with gardens and orchards full of sundry deli∣cate fruits and herbes. Of this island the whole kingdome (as is aforesaide) tooke the name; which vpon the coast extendeth it selfe to Cabo Delgado, or the slender Cape (being the limite betweene Moçambique and this kingdome of Quiloa) &amp; from thence it stretcheth vnto the foresaid riuer of Coauo. In old time this kingdome of Quiloa was the chiefest of all the principalities there adioining; for the Arabians which were masters there∣of had inlarged their dominions for the space of nine hundred miles, so that all the sea-coast and the islands, as farre as Cabo de los Corrientes situ∣ate in fower and twentie degrees of southerly latitude, were tributarie and subiect thereunto. Whereupon when the Portugals arriued in those coun∣tries, the king of this place trusted so much to himselfe, that he thought he was able with his owne forces, not onely to make a defensiue warre against them, but also to driue them from those places, which they had already sur∣prized. Howbeit, quite contrarie to his expectation, he was by the Por∣tugals vtterly vanquished and put to flight. Who seazing vpon the isle and citie, enriched themselues with the great booties &amp; spoiles that they found therein. Thus the mightie king of Quiloa (who before the Portugals arri∣uall in those parts, enioied also the chiefe commoditie of the rich gold mines of Sofala) became atlength, by a composition made with <HI>Don Pedro Cabral,</HI> tributarie to the crowne of Portugall, paying for tribute at the first fiue hundred, and afterward fifteene hundred peeces of gold. Vpon the foresaid isle the Portugals erected a fortresse, which their king afterward commanded them to deface, considering that there were other forts suffici∣ent enough for that coast.</P>

In the principall of the three foresaide isles, there is a very commodious and secure hauen, capable of all kinde of vessels, and there also the Portugals haue built a very strong forte: where albeit in regard of the lownes and moisture of the soile, being
<PB N="30" REF="22"/>
full of bogges and fens, the aire be most vnholsome, and in manner pesti∣lent: yet the oportunitie of the place, and the plentie of victuals, haue made it one of the most famous and frequented hauens in all that Ocean. For which cause the fleetes which saile from Portugall to the east Indies, when they are out of hope to performe their voiage in summer, do vsually resort to spend the whole winter at Moçambique: and those Portugale ships also which come from the Indies toward Europe, must of necessitie touch at this place, to furnish themselues with victuals. Along these coasts do saile certaine Moores in vessels sowed or fastened togither with thongs of le∣ther, the sailes whereof they make of Palme-leaues, and in stead of pitch and tallow, they calke them with gumme which they gather in the woods. Vnto this kingdome of Moçambique belongeth the prouince of Angoscia, so<NOTE PLACE="marg">Angoscia.</NOTE> called from certaine isles of that name, lying directly ouer against it, which prouince stretcheth to the riuer of Cuama.

<P>Sofala, or Sefala, the fift and last general part of Zanguebar, is a small<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sofala the fift part of Zan∣guebar.</NOTE> kingdome lying vpon the sea-coast, between the riuers of Cuama and Mag∣nice, being so called after the name of a riuer running through it, in which riuer lyeth an Island, which is the head and principal place of the whole countrie. On this Island the Portugales <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> built a most strong forte, by meanes whereof they are become Lordes of the richest trade in all those parts. For (to say nothing of the Iuorie, Amber, and slaues which are hither brought) all the gold in a manner that is taken out of those manifolde and endlesse mines of Sofala and all the Inland-countries thereabouts, is here exchanged vnto the Portugales for cotton-cloth, silkes, and other commo∣dities of Cambaia: all which is thought yeerely to amount vnto the summe of two millions of gold. This golden trade was first in the power of the Moores of Magadazo; and afterward it befell to them of Quiloa. The inha∣bitants of Sofala are Mahumetans, being gouerned by a king of the same sect, who yeeldeth obedience to the crowne of Portugale, because hee will not be subiect to the empire of Monomotapa.</P>
<P>Neither is it heere to bee omitted, that in these parts vnder the name of Iuorie, are bartered not onely elephants teeth, but also the teeth of sea-hor∣ses: which creatures are commonly found in the riuers of Nilus, Niger, Co∣auo, Cuama, Magnice, and all other the great riuers of Africa.</P>

The emperour of this country hol∣deth a continuall league with the princes of Melinde, Mombaça, and Qui∣loa, towards the sea, for traffiques sake: for they prouide his dominions with cloth of cotton, cloth of silke, and sundrie other commodities brought from Arabia, Persia, Cambaya, and India, which are very well esteemed in those parts: but among the rest they bring especially certaine little balles, of a red colour, and in substance like vnto glasse, being made in Cambaya of a kinde of Bitumen or clammie claie, which balles they vse to weare like beades about their necks. They serue also to them in stead of money, for gold they make none account of. Likewise with the silkes that are brought vnto them they apparel themselues from the girdle downward. In exchange of all the foresaide wares and commodities they giue gold, siluer, copper, and iuorie. Howbeit vpon his Inland frontiers to the south and southwest, he maintaineth continuall and bloudie warres against the emperour of Mo∣nomotapa, his principall and greatest forces consisting of a most barbarous and fierce nation, called by the people of Congo Giachi, but by them∣selues Agag, who inhabite from the first great lake which is the fountaine of Nilus, for a certaine space vpon both sides of the said riuer, and then af∣terward on the westerne banke as farre as the second great lake from whence Zaire hath his chiefe original, &amp; thence euen to the confines of <HI>Prete Ianni.</HI> They are a wilde and lawles people, liuing (after the manner of the ancient Scythians and Nomades, and like the Tartars and Baduin-Arabians of these times) a vagrant kind of life, vnder cabbins and cottages in the open for∣rests.

They are man-eaters, and couragious in battaile. For their armour of defence they vse certaine Pauises or great targets wher∣with they couer their whole bodies, being otherwise naked: and their offen∣siue weapons are dartes and daggers. It is not many yeeres since these cruel sauages ranging westward from Nilus, inuaded the kingdome of Congo, vanquished the inhabitants in sundrie battels, tooke the head citie, and for∣ced the king <HI>Don Aluaro</HI> to flee for succour and safetie vnto the isle of hor∣ses, in the mouth of the great riuer Zaire, being one of the extreme fron∣tiers of his dominions.

This empire of his lyeth, as it were, in an Island which containeth in compasse seuen hundred and fiftie, or (as some thinke) one thousand leagues, being limited on the north-west by the great lake whereout Nilus springeth; on the south, by the riuer Magnice and the tributarie kingdome of Butua or Toroa; on the east it hath the sea-coast and the kingdome of Sofala, which in very deed is a member thereof; and the North part abutteth vpon the riuer of Cuama, and the empire of Mohene∣mugi. That part of this great Island which lyeth betweene the mouth of Cu∣ama,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some will haue Magnice and Cuama to be two branches of one mightie ri∣uer springing out of the great lake; which be∣ing so, they must quite separate Monomotapa from the same lake.</NOTE> and the cape de los Corrientes, is a very pleasant, holesome, and fruit∣full country. And from the said cape to the riuer of Magnice, the whole re∣gion aboundeth with beasts both great and small; but it is cold by reason of the sharp brizes which come off the sea; and so destitute of wood, that the people for fewel are constrained to vse the dung of beasts, and they apparel themselues in their skinnes. Along the banke of the riuer Cuama are diuers hilles and downes couered with trees, and vallies likewise watered with ri∣uers, being pleasantly situate, and well peopled. Here are such plenty of Ele∣phants, as it seemeth by the great quantitie of their teeth, that there are yeerely slaine betweene foure and fiue thousand. Their elephants are nine cubites high, and fiue cubites in thicknes: They haue long and broad eares, little eyes, shorte tailes, and great bellies: and some are of opinion, that Ethiopia yeeldeth as many elephants, as Europe doth oxen. The townes and villages of this empire are very few, and their buildings are of wood and clay, couered with thatch. None may haue doores to their houses but onely great personages. Their principal cities are<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This place both in regard of the name and situation may seeme to haue been Agysimba mentioned by Ptolemey.</NOTE> Zimbas, and Benamataza, the first whereof is one and twentie, and the second fifteene daies iourney from Sofala.

Tribute he taketh none, but onely certaine daies seruice and giftes presented vnto him; without which there is no appearing in his sight. Hee carrieth, whithersoeuer he go, foure hundred dogs, as a most sure and trustie guard. Hee keepeth all the heires of his tributary princes, as vassals, and as pledges of their fathers loialtie.

They go apparelled in cloth of cotton, either made by them∣selues, or brought from other countries: howbeit the king will in no case weare any forrein cloth for feare of poison or such like trecherie: and the meaner sort of his subiects are clad in beasts skins. Among all the armies and legions of soldiers, which this emperour (for the defence of his great estate) is forced to maintaine, his Amazones or women warriers before mentionied are the most valiant, being indeed the very sinewes and chiefe strength of all his militarie forces. These women, after the manner of the ancient Scythish or Asiatike Amazones, so much spoken of in histories of former times, seare off their left paps, that they might not be an hinderance vnto them in their shooting. They are most expert in warlike stratagems, and swift of foote. Their weapons are bowes and arrowes. At certaine times for generations sake they accompany with men; sending the male children home to their fathers, but keeping their daughters vnto themselues. They inhabite towards the west, not farre from the beginning of Nilus, in certaine places which themselues make choise of, and which are graunted vnto them by the fauour of the Emperour.</P>
<P>This empire of Monomotapa comprehendeth not onely the foresaid great island, but stretcheth it selfe farther also toward the cape of Buena esperanca, as farre as the kingdomes of Butua or Toroa, which being go∣uerned by particular lords, do acknowledge Monomotapa for their soue∣raigne. Throughout all this emperours dominions is found infinite quan∣titie of gold, in the earth, in the rockes, and in the riuers. The gold-mines of this countrey neerest vnto Sofala are those of Manica, vpon a plaine enui∣roned with mountaines; and those also in the prouince of Matuca, which is inhabited by the people called Battonghi, and situate betweene the Equi∣noctiall line and the Tropique of Capricorne. These mines are distant from Sofala, betweene the space of 300. and sixe hundred miles: but those of the prouinces of Boro and Quiticui are fifteene hundred miles distant towards the west. Others there are also in the kingdomes of Toroa or Butua: so that from hence or from Sofala, or from some other part of Monomotapa, some are of opinion, that <HI>Salomons</HI> gold for the adorning of the temple at Ierusalem, was brought by sea. A thing in truth not very vnlikely: for here in Toroa, and in diuers places of Monomotapa are till this day remaining ma∣nie huge and ancient buildings of timber, lime and stone, being of singular workemanship, the like whereof are not to be found in all the prouinces there abouts. Heere is also a mightie wall of fiue and twentie spannes thicke, which the people asoribe to the workemanship of the diuell, being accoun∣ted from Sofala fiue hundred and ten miles the neerest way. All other

And heere I may boldly affirme, that the ancient buildings of this part of Africa, &amp; along the coast of the east Indies, may not onely be compared, but euen preferred before the buildings of Europe. The authors of which ancient monuments are vnknowen: but the later African buil∣dings haue beene erected by the Arabians.

The saide Cape of Buena esperança is deuided into three smaller headlands or capes; The westermost, being called Cabo de buena esperança, or The cape of good hope after the name of the whole promontorie, and being cut from the rest of the firme land: The middlemost is named Cabo falso, because the Portugales in their voiage homewards from the east Indies, haue some∣times mistaken this for the true cape beforementioned; betweene which two capes runneth into the sea a mightie riuer called by the Portugales Rio dolce (where their caraks often take in fresh water) and by the naturall inha∣bitants Camissa, which springeth out of a small lake called Gale, situate among The mountaines of the moon so much celebrated by ancient geo∣graphers: The third and eastermost cape stretching farthest into the sea, is called Cabo das Agulhas, or the cape of Needles, because there the nee∣dles of dialles touched with the loadstone, stand directly North, without any variation either to the east or to the west: betweene this cape and the foresaid westermost cape (which ly forth into the sea like two hornes) is the bredth of this mightie promontorie, containing about fiue and twentie leagues; the length whereof from the riuer of Fernando Poo, where it be∣ginneth to iuttie forth into the sea, along the westerne coast southward, to

the cape das Agulhas, amounteth to two thousand two hundred Italian miles; and from Cabo das Agulhas, along the easterne shore northward, to Cape Guardafu, are three thousand three hundred of the same miles. This cape at the first discouerie thereof was called by Nauigators, The Lyon of the sea; &amp; Cabo tormentoso, or The tēpestuous cape; not so much, as I take it, for the dangerous and stormie seas more about this cape then any other; but partly in regard of the chargeable, dangerous, and long trauels of the Portugals before they could attaine vnto it; and partly bicause of the great compasse which in their voiages outward they are constrained to fetch for the doubling thereof; and partly also in regard of some tempestuous and stormie weather wherewith they haue beene encountered at this Cape; which notwithstanding at certaine times is an ordinarie matter vpon all shores and promontories ouer the face of the whole earth.

And as the Spa∣niards for a long time (that they might discourage all other nations from attempting nauigation vpon The south sea beyond America) blinded all Christendome with a report, that the streights of Magellan were vnrepas∣able: so perhaps the Portugals, to terrifie all others from sailing to the east Indies, and to keepe the gaine and secrets of that rich trade entire vnto themselues, haue in their writings and relations made the doubling of the cape of Buena Esperança, and the crossing ouer those seas, a matter of farre greater difficultie and danger, then it is of late manifestly found to be. The name of Buena esperança or good hope, was giuen vnto this promontory by <HI>Iohn</HI> the second king of Portugall; bicause that when his fleetes had once doubled this cape, either outward or homeward, they then stedfastly hoped in good time to performe the residue of their voiage; otherwise not. In the midst of this cape lieth a plot of ground of that beautie and delight, as that without any humane industrie it may compare with the most artificiall gardens of Europe. On the top of this place, nature minding as it were to excell her-selfe, hath framed a great plaine, which for beautifull situation, fruitfulnes of herbes, varietie of flowers, and flourishing verdure of all things, seemeth to resemble a terrestriall paradise. The Portugals terme it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> vnfitly, The table of the cape. And to the end they might not faile of the meanes to enioy so pleasant a place, there is close vnder it a very good harbour which is called The port of Conception.</P>

The people of this place called in the Arabian toong Cafri, Cafres, or Cafates, that is to say, lawlesse or outlawes, are for the most part exceeding blacke of colour, which very thing may be a sufficient argument, that the sunne is not the sole or chiefe cause of their blacknes; for in diuers other countries where the heate thereof is farre more scorching and intolerable, there are tawnie, browne, yellowish, ash-coloured, and white people; so that the cause there of seemeth rather to be an hereditarie qualitie transfused from the parents, then the intemperature of an hot climate, though it also may be some furtherance thereunto. The Hollanders in the yeere 1595. en∣tering the harbour of Saint Bras, somewhat to the east of Cabo das Agul∣has, had conuersation &amp; truck with some of these Cafres, whom they found to be a stoute and valiant people, but very base and contemptible in their behauiour and apparell, being clad in oxe and sheeps skins, wrapped about their shoulders with the hairie sides inward, in forme of a mantle. Their weapons are a kinde of small slender dartes or pikes, some whereof are hea∣ded with some kinde of mettall, the residue being vnheaded, and hardened onely at the points with fire. They couer their priuie parts with a sheepes tayle, which is bound vp before and behinde with a girdle. Their horne∣beasts are, like those of Spaine, verie well limmed and proportioned. Their sheepe are great and faire, not hauing any wooll on their backes, but a kinde of harsh haire like goates. Other particulars by them obserued, for breuities sake, I omit.</P>
<P>Now that we may proceede in describing the residue of Cafraria, hauing sayled about the cape of Buena esperança westward, albeit the coast in re∣gard of the greatnes thereof may seem to ly directly north, yet for the space of seuenteene degrees, till you come to Cabo Negro, (the farthest North∣westerne bound of this fift part of the lower Ethiopia) it trendeth somewhat to the west: along which coast somewhat within the lande appeareth a migh∣ty ranke or ridge of mountaines, called by the Portugales Os picos frago∣sos,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Picos fra∣gosos.</NOTE> that is, the ragged points or spires, being besides their excessiue height, craggie, rough, and steepe, lying bare, desolate, and vtterly voide of all suc∣cour, and seruing for no other end, but for an obiect to the windes, and a mark for the tempests. The residue of the coast, till you come to Cabo Ne∣gro, sometimes lying lowe and sometimes high, sometimes shooting into the sea, and sometimes again gently retiring, containeth many plaines, hils, vallies, and places most fertile and delightful; some of them being alwaies of so fresh and pleasant view, as they seeme to represent a continuall spring.</P>

<P>FIrst therefore (according to our proposed or∣der)<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kingdome of Matama.</NOTE> that we may begin with the most souther∣ly parts; The kingdome of Matama so called after the name of the king thereof, (who being a Gentile ruleth ouer diuers prouinces named Quimbebe) bordereth north vpon the first great lake whereout Nilus springeth, and vpon the south frontiers of Angola; east it abutteth vpon the western banke of the riuer Bagamidri; and stretcheth south as far as the riuer Brauagul, which springeth out of the mountains of the moone. This coūtrey standeth in a good &amp; holesome aire, &amp; aboundeth with mines of cristall &amp; other me∣tals, &amp; hath victuals great plenty. And although the people thereof &amp; their neighbour-borderers doe traffike togither; yet the king of Matama and the king of Angola wage war oftentimes one against another: also the said riuer Bagamidri deuideth this kingdome of Matama from the great empire of Monomotapa before described, which lieth to the east thereof.</P>
<P>Next followeth Angola, a kingdome subiect in times past to the king of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Angola.</NOTE> Congo, the gouernour whereof not verie many yeeres ago, growing excee∣dingly rich &amp; mightie, rebelled against his soueraigne, &amp; by diuers attempts shaking off the yoke of superioritie, became himselfe an absolute prince. This countrey, by reason that the people are suffered to haue as many wiues as they list, is a place most woonderfully populous. They goe whole milli∣ons of them to the warres, not leauing any men of seruice behinde: but for want of victuals they are often constrained to leaue their enterprises halfe vndone. Vpon this king, <HI>Paulo Diaz,</HI> who remained gouernour in these parts for the king of Portugall, waged warre: the reason was, bicause certaine Portugall merchants and others going by way of traffike to Ca∣baza, a towne situate an hundred and fiftie miles from the sea, where the king of Angola vsually resideth; they were by order from this king, the same yeere that king <HI>Sebastian</HI> died in Barbarie, sodainly spoiled of their goods, and part of them slaine; it being alleaged, that they were all spies, and came
<PB N="38" REF="26"/>
to vndermine the present state. Whereupon <HI>Paulo Diaz</HI> prouided himselfe, and with two galeots did many notable exploits on both sides of the riuer Coanza. Finally hauing built a forte in a very commodious and hillie ground, at the confluence or meeting of the riuer last mentioned, and the riuer Luiola, with a small number of Portugals, ioined to the aide sent him from the king of Congo and from certaine princes of Angola his confede∣rates, he gaue the foresaid king (notwithstanding his innumerable troupes of Negros) diuers &amp; sundry ouerthrowes. The said riuer Coanza springeth out of the lake of Aquelunda, situate westward of the great lake whereour Nilus takes his originall. In this kingdome are the mountaines of Cabam∣be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The siluer∣mines of Ca∣bambe.</NOTE> abounding with rich and excellent siluer mines; which haue ministred the chiefe occasion of all the foresaid warres. This region aboundeth al∣so with other minerals, and with cattell of all sorts. Most true it is, that dogs∣flesh is heere accounted of all others the daintiest meate; for which cause they bring vp and fatten great plentie of dogs for the shambles. Yea it hath beene constantly affirmed, that a great dogge accustomed to the bull was sold in exchange of two and twentie slaues, the value of whom coulde not amount to much lesse then two hundred and twentie ducats. The priests of Angola called Gange, are helde in such estimation and account, as the peo∣ple are verily perswaded, that they haue in their power abundance and scar∣citie, life and death. For they haue knowledge of medicinable hearbes, and of deadly poisons also, which they keepe secret vnto themselues; and by meanes of their familiaritie with the diuell, they often foretell things to come.</P>

<P>Thus hauing briefely pointed at the former three bordering countries, let vs now with like breuitie passe through the kingdome of Congo it selfe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bahia das <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or the baye of Cowes.</NOTE> This kingdome therefore (accounting Angola, as indeede it is, a member thereof) beginneth at Bahia das vacas in thirteene, and endeth at Cabo da Caterina in two degrees and an halfe of southerly latitude. True it is that the coast neere vnto the saide Bay of Cowes is subiect to the king of Congo, but the inland is gouerned by him of Angola. East and west it stret∣cheth from the sea in bredth as farre as the lake of Aquelunda, for the space of sixe hundred miles, and is diuided into sixe prouinces: namely, the pro∣uince<NOTE PLACE="marg">The six prouin∣ces of Congo.</NOTE> of Pemba, situate in the very hart and center of the whole kingdome; Batta, the most easterly prouince, where the ancient writers seeme to haue placed Agisymba; Pango which bordereth vpon the Pangelungi; Sundi the most Northerly prouince; Sogno which stretcheth ouer the mouth of the great riuer Zaire; and Bamba which is the principall of all the rest both for extension of ground, for riches, and for militarie forces. In the

prouince of Pemba, or rather in a seuerall territorie by it selfe, standeth the<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Saluador the chiefe citie of Congo.</NOTE> citie of Sant Saluador, in former times called Banza, being the metropoli∣tan of all Congo, and the seate of the king, situate an hundred and fiftie miles from the sea, vpon a rockie and high mountaine; on the verie top whereof is a goodly plaine abounding with fountaines of holesome and sweete water, and with all other good things which are requisite ei∣ther for the sustenance, or solace of mankinde: and vpon this plaine where Sant Saluador is seated, there may inhabite to the number of an hundred thousand persons. In this citie the Portugals haue a warde by themselues, separate from the rest, containing a mile in compasse: and about that bignes also is the palace or house of the king. The residue of the people dwell for the most part scatteringly in villages. It is a place enriched by nature with corne, cattell, fruits, and holesome springs of water in great abundance. The principall riuer of all Congo called Zaire, taketh his chiefe originall<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Zaire.</NOTE> out of the second lake of Nilus, lying vnder the Equinoctiall line: and albeit this is one of the mightiest riuers of all Africa, being eight and twentie miles broad at the mouth, yet was it vtterly vnknowen to ancient writers. Amongst other riuers it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Vumba and Barbela, which spring out of the first great lake. In this countrey are sundry other riuers also, which fetch their originall out of the lake of Aquelunda: the principall whereof are Co∣anza, which diuideth the kingdome of Congo from that of Angola, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crocodiles.</NOTE> riuer Lelunda, which breedeth crocodiles &amp; water-horses which the Greeks call Hippopotami, of which creatures the isle of horses in the mouth of the riuer Zaire taketh denomination. The Hippopotamus or water-horse is<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water-horses.</NOTE> somewhat tawnie, of the colour of a lion; in the night he comes on lande to feed vpon the grasse, and keepeth in the water all the day time. The Afri∣cans tame and manage some of these horses, and they prooue exceeding swift; but a man must beware how he passe ouer deepe riuers with them, for they will sodainly diue vnder water. Also in these riuers of Ethiopia are bred a kinde of oxen, which liue euery night vpon the lande. Here likewise breedeth another strange creature, called in the Congonian language Am∣bize Angulo, that is to say, a hogge-fish, being so exceeding fatte, and of such greatnes, that some of them weie aboue fiue hundred pound. This abūdance of waters, togither with the heat of the climate, which proceedeth from the neerenes of the sunne, causeth the countrey to be most fruitfull of plants, herbes, fruits, and corne; &amp; much more fertile would it be, if nature were helped forward by the industrie of the inhabitants. Heere also, besides goates, sheepe, deere, Gugelle, conies, hares, ciuet-cats, and ostriches, are great swarmes of tigres, which are very hurtfull both to man and beast. The Zebra or Zabra of this countrey being about the bignes of a mule, is a<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Zabra.</NOTE> beast of incomparable swiftnes, straked about the body, legges, eares, and other parts, with blacke, white and browne circles of three fingers broad; which do make a pleasant shew.

Also here are infinite store of elephants<NOTE PLACE="marg">The elephant.</NOTE> of such monstrous bignes, that by the report of sundrie credible persons, some of their teeth do weigh two hundred pounds, at sixteene ounces the pound: vpon the plaines this beast is swifter then any horse, by reason of his long steps; onely he cannot turne with such celeritie. Trees he ouerturneth with the strength of his backe, or breaketh them between his teeth; or stan∣deth vpright vpon his hinder feete, to browse vpon the leaues and tender sprigs. The she elephants beare their brood in their wombes two yeeres be∣fore they bring foorth yoong ones: neither are they great with yoong, but onely from seuen yeeres to seuen yeeres. This creature is saide to liue 150. yeeres; hee is of a gentle disposition; and relying vpon his great strength, he hurteth none but such as do him iniurie; only he will in a spor∣ting maner gently heaue vp with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such persons as he meeteth. He loueth the water beyond measure, and will stande vp to the mid-body there∣in, bathing the ridge of his backe, and other parts with his long promuscis or trunke. His skin is fower fingers thicke; and it is reported, that an ele∣phant of this countrey being stricken with a little gunne called Petrera, was not wounded therewith, but so sore brused inwardly, that within three daies after he died. Heere are likewise reported to be mightie adders or snakes of fiue and twentie spannes long, and fiue spans broad, which will swallow vp an whole stagge, or any other creature of that bignes. Neither are they here destitute of Indie-cockes and hens, partridges, feasants, and innumera∣ble birds of praie, both of the lande and of the sea; whereof some diue vnder the water, which the Portugals call Pelicans.</P>
<P>Ouer against the most southerly part of the said kingdome of Congo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The isle and hauen of Lo∣anda.</NOTE> where it confineth with Angola, lyeth an Isle called Loanda, being twentie miles long, and but one mile broad at the most, betweene which and the maine land is the best port of all that Ocean. About this Isle do haunt infi∣nite store of whales, where notwithstanding no amber at all is found; which is a manifest argument that it proceedeth notfrom these creatures. Here they fish for certaine little shels, which in Congo and the countries adioy∣ning are vsed in steed of mony. The well-waters of this Isle, when the sea ebbeth, are salte, but when it floweth they are most fresh and sweet. In this Isle the Portugals haue a towne from whence they traffique to Congo and Angola: and amongst other commodities, they get euery yeere in those parts about fiue thousand slaues; the custome of which trade belongeth by ancient constitutions vnto the crowne of Portugale.</P>

are the best; and some are of opinion, that here groweth the right Lignum Aquilae, which is of so excellent vertue in phisick. They haue one supreme king, with many princes vnder him. They traffique in Congo, and carrie home from thence salt and great shels to be vsed for coine (which are brought thither from the Isle of San Tomé) in exchange of their cloth of the palme tree, and of Iuory: but the chiefe commodities which they part from, are slaues of their owne nation and of Nubia: and the said shels they vse also insteed of Iewels and ornaments. Both they and the Bramas be∣fore mentioned do carry for their defence in the warres, certaine targets made of the skin of a beast which in Germany is called Dante: their wea∣pons offensiue be little bowes and shorte arrowes, which they shoot with such woonderfull celerity, as they will discharge twentie one after another, before the first arrow fall to the ground. They haue shambles of mans-flesh as wee haue of beeues and muttons. They eat their enemies which they take in the warres: their slaues which they cannot make away for a good round price, they sell vnto the butchers: and some will offer themselues to the slaughter, for the loue of their princes and patrons: so sillie they are, that to do their lordes a pleasure, they will not refuse present death: wherefore the Portugals repose not so much trust in any kinde of slaues as in them: and they are very valiant also in the warres.</P>
<P>But, to returne vnto the sea-coast; from the mouth of the riuer Zaire Northward, the land bearing out somewhat more to the west, is framed in∣to three headlands, namely, Cabo primero, Cabo da Caterina, and the cape of Lopo Gonsalues, which is a cape very well knowen in regard of the emi∣nency and outstretching thereof. Itlyeth in one degree of southerly lati∣tude, Ouer against which cape within the land do inhabite the people called Bramas in the kingdome of Loango beforementioned. From hence for the space of fiue or sixe degrees, till you come to Punta delgada, or The slender point, the coast lyeth in a manner directly North; most of which tract is in∣habited by a nation of Negros called Ambus. North of the said slender point you haue Rio dos Camarones, or the riuer of shrimpes, which is full of little Isles; not far from which riuer are The countries of Biafar and Me∣dra, inhabited with people which are addicted to inchantments, witchcrafts, and all kind of abominable sorceries.</P>

The countrey in most pla∣ces is destitute of trees that beare fruite: neither haue the greatest part of the inhabitants any haire on their bodies, saue onely a thicke tuft growing vpon their heads: they sell their children vnto strangers, supposing that their estate cannot possiblie be impaired. Vnto these naturall miseries of the place, you may ad the insupportable mischiefes which are here done by the locustes: for albeit these creatures do infinite harme likewise in all the inner parts of Africa; yet seemeth it that this countrey of Ghinea is their most proper habitation; whither they do often resort in such innumerable swarmes, that like a mightie thicke cloud they come raking along in the skie, and afterward falling downe, they couer the face of the earth, deuouring all things that they light vpon. Their comming towards any place is known two or three daies before by the yellownes of the sunne.

They which haue eaten of them affirme that they are of a good taste, and that their flesh (so much as it is) is as white as that of a lobster.

Gambea springeth out of the same fountaines assigned by <HI>Ptolemey</HI> vn∣to Niger (which by all the ancient writers is placed heereabout) and out of the lake of Libya.

The riuer of Senaga is thought to take his original out of the lakes called Chelonides. It containeth certaine Isles, which in regard of their rough and ragged shape are good for nothing, but to breed adders and such like hurtfull things, and these Isles in many places make the riuer vtterly in∣nauigable.

Finally it voideth into the sea at two mouths, one of which mouthes is a mile broad. And it is strange to consider, how vpon the south side of this riuer the people are blacke and well proportioned, and the soile pleasant and fertile; whereas on the north side they are browne and of a small stature, and do inhabite a barren and mise∣rable countrie. In both the said riuers of Gambra and Senaga do breed di∣uers strange kindes offishes, and other creatures of the water, as namely crocodiles, sea-horses, and winged serpents; and hither come to drinke sun∣dry sorts of wilde beafts. The lands comprehended betweene them both, by reason of their yeerely inundation (for from the xv. of Iune they increase fortie daies togither, and are so long time decreasing, after the manner of Nilus) abound with all kinds of graine and pulse wherof the climate is capa∣ble, as namely with beanes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, millet, &amp;c. but wheate, rie, barley, and grapes cannot there attaine to ripenes and perfection, by reason of ouer∣much moisture: saue onely some small quantitie of wheat neere the deserts where the Caraguloni inhabite. But their chiefe sustenance is Zabur∣ro, otherwise called Ghinie-wheate or Maiz, which they sowe after the in∣undation of their riuers, casting some quantitie of sande thereupon to de∣fend it from the heate, which otherwise would scorch the grounde too

excessiuely. They drinke the iuice of the palme-tree, which they cut and lance for that purpose: and this iuice not being tempered, is as strong and headie as any wine. Neither are they heere destitute of mightie adders, of lions, leopards, and elephants: but beasts for labour they haue none, saue onely a small kinde of oxen, and goates. The horses which are brought thither by merchants, liue but a short time. The aire, by reason of abundance of lakes bredde by the ouerflowes of their riuers, is moist and grosse. And heere fall most vnholesome and palpable dewes. It raineth in these countries from October till the end of Iuly, euery day about noone, with thunder and lightning.</P>
<P>All the kingdomes and countries by vs before described, from the cape of Buena esperança, to the riuer last mentioned, are inhabited by blacke people. The most northerly are the Gialofi, who spread themselues between the two foresaid riuers for the space of fiue hundred miles eastward: so that the riuer Senaga is the vtmost northren bound of Negros, or nations ex∣tremely blacke; howbeit vpon the bankes thereof are found people of sun∣dry colours, by reason of the varietie of women.</P>
<P>Betweene this riuer of Senaga and Cabo blanco, or the white cape, lieth a countrey called by some Anterote, being all ouer in a manner sandy, bar∣ren, lowe, and plaine; neither is there in all this distance any place of ac∣count or reckoning, saue onely the isles of Arguin (where of we will intreat among the isles of Africa) and a territorie or towne sixe daies iourney with∣in the maine, called Hoden. This towne is not walled, but lieth open, and<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vol. 1. fol. 99.</NOTE> consisteth of the wandring Arabians rude and homely habitations, being notwithstanding a place of Rendeuous or meeting for all such as trauell in Carouans from Tombuto, and other places in the lande of Negros to Bar∣barie. The principall food of the inhabitants heere, are dates and barly, both which the soile yeeldeth indeed, but not in so plentifull a manner: and they drinke the milke of camels &amp; of other beasts, for wine they haue none at all. These people are Mahumetans, and most deadly enimies to Christians: neither abide they long in any place, but runne rouing and wandring vp and downe those deserts. They are themselues very populous, and haue abun∣dance of camels, vpon whose backes they carrie copper, siluer, and other commodities from Barbarie to Tombuto, and to the residue of the land of Negros.</P>
<P>From Cabo blanco to the regions of Sus, and Hea (which are the first prouinces described by <HI>Iohn Leo</HI>) excepting a small portion onely of Bile∣dulgerid, you haue nothing but part of the vast, fruitles, &amp; vninhabitable de∣sert of Libya, called by the Arabians Sarra, which stretcheth from the westerne Ocean as farre as the frontiers of Egypt.</P>

<HEAD>The Islands of the Red sea.</HEAD>
<P>BOth the shores of the Red sea, as well on the African as on the Arabian side, are euerie where beset with many small islets and rockes, which lie so thicke togither, that they make the nauigation all along the said coasts to be most dangerous and difficult.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE></P>
<P>The isles of the Red sea most woorthie to be remembred, are these following. Babelmandel a little isle situate in the very mouth of the Red sea, in twelue degrees, containeth two leagues in compasse, being from either of the firme lands three miles distant, and standing about twentie paces high out of the water. By <HI>Ptolemey</HI> it is called The isle of Diodorus. Vpon this isle, or one of the continents adioining, are to be hired the most experimēted pilots for al that narrow sea, euen as far as Suez. And from the easterne and westerne side of this islet, <HI>Strabo</HI> reporteth that the twofold enterance of the Arabian Gulfe was barred with a double chaine. More to the north standeth Camaran, being about eight leagues<NOTE PLACE="marg">The isle of Camaran.</NOTE> from the Arabian coast in fifteene degrees of latitude. Vpon this isle are to be seene great ruines of ancient buildings. It hath one indifferent good ha∣uen, and aboundeth with fresh water, (a thing most precious and acceptable in those parts) with salt, and with cattell. On the other side towards Afri∣ca, in fifteene degrees and an halfe, standeth the isle of Dalaqua of a∣bout<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dalaqua.</NOTE> thirtie miles in circuite, which space is almost contained in the length thereof, being a place very famous for the abundance of pearles which are there caught; wherewithall likewise the isle of Mua neere vnto it is richly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mua.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> end owed.

aboue a bow-shoot distant from the African maine: betweene which isle and the continent, there is an excellent hauen which is now the only porte that <HI>Prete Ianni</HI> hath in all his dominions; for which (as you may read before in the description of the said princes empire) his lieutenant <HI>Barna∣gasso</HI> is constrained to pay a great yeerely tribute to the Turke.</P>
<P>Ouer against Mazua, vpon the firme, standeth the towne of Ercoco. Vpon this little isle are diuers houses of Arabians, built of lime and stone; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">The isle, hauen, and citie of Suaquen.</NOTE> others of claie couered with thatch. North of Mazua standeth Suaquen in a certain lake made by the sea, which there insinuateth it selfe within the land, and frameth a most secure and commodious hauen. On this small islet is built the faire and stately citie of Suaquen, being almost as large as the isle it selfe; wherein resideth the Turkes lieutenant or Bassa of Abassia.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Isle of Socotera and other isles lying without the narrow entrance of the Arabian gulfe.</HEAD>
<P>WIthout the streight of Babelmandel there are no islands woorthy of mention, saue onely Socotera; which (as <HI>Iohn Barros</HI> supposeth) was of old called by <HI>Ptolemey</HI> Dioscoridis &amp; lieth in sight of cape Guardafu, which the same author nameth Aromata Promōtorium. Being about three∣score miles long, and fiue and twentie miles broad, it is diuided with a rough and exceeding high ridge of mountaines, and is subiect vnto most terrible and boisterous windes, which do out of measure dry and parch the same. For which cause, and in regard of the slothfull rudenes of the inhabitants, it is very scarce of victuals: for it yeeldeth neither wheate, rice, wine, nor hony. In the vallies and places of shelter it affoordeth some quantitie of Millet, of dates, and of sundrie kinds of fruits: neither is it altogither destitute of pa∣sture for cattell. It is frequented by merchants for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or vermillion.</NOTE> Cinabre, Sanguis Dra∣conis, and the most excellent Aloës of the world. It hath no hauen of im∣portance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two townes of the Portugales in Socotora.</NOTE> The Portugals are heere possessed of two small townes, one called Coro, and the other Benin; and here in times past the king of Fartac [<HI>A countrey of Arabia Foelix,</HI>] had a castle &amp; a garrison of soldiers vpon this isle, which castle being taken by the Portugals, was afterward by them aban∣doned, bicause it quited not the cost. The inhabitants being of a browne colour, and of a good constitution; are in religion a kind of Christians. They hold an opinion that Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> suffred shipwracke vpon this isle, and that of his ship was built a most ancient church, which as yet is to be seene walled round about, with three allies or partitions, and three doores.</P>
<P>Furthermore they liue for the most part in caues or in cabins made of boughes, very farre from the sea. They go apparrelled in course cloth, or in the skins of beastes. In war their weapons are slings, and swordes made of base iron: and the women are as good soldiers as the men. They are much addicted vnto Magick and inchantments, and doe bring to passe matters in∣credible. They haue no vse at all of nauigation, nor of traffique, and yet for∣sooth
<PB N="48" REF="31"/>
they esteeme themselues the most noble and worthy people vnder the heauens; as also they are vtterly voide of learning: which I doe note, be∣cause that such as are learned make but small account of their wisedome.</P>
<P>To the North of Socotera are two small Isles which are called the two<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two sisters.</NOTE> sisters: the inhabitants whereof being of an oliue-colour, liue without lawe, and haue no conuersation with any other people. The commodities of these Islets are Iuorie, amber, Sanguis draconis, Aloës, and a kind of pretious stones called Nizzolij.</P>
<P>Likewise ouer against Socotera are two other Islets, one called the Isle of men, and the other the Isle of women, being distant thirtie miles asunder, and fiue miles from Socotera. They are so termed, because that in the one dwell men onely, and in the other women. Howbeit they visite one ano∣ther at certaine seasons: but they cannot stay one in the Isle of another aboue three moneths, in regarde of a secret qualitie of the ayer which is contrary to either sexe. A matter (if it be true) most strange and admira∣ble.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Isles lying in the sea called Sinus Barbaricus, ouer against the Easterne and Southeasterne shore of Africa.</HEAD>
<P>ALl along from the cape of Guardafu to the cape of Buena Esperança are found sundry Islands, partly dispersed heere and there in the sea, and partly adioining vpon the firme land. Such as are far into the sea, are the greatest part vnhabited, as namly, the Isle of Don Garçia, The * three and The * seuen brethren, As rocas partidas, the Isles of Sant Brandan, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isles which are not inhabited.</NOTE> those of Mascarenha, of Sant Francis, of Santa Apollonia, of Iohn de Lis∣boa, of Cosinoledo: and betweene the great Isle of Saint Laurence and the maine, the Isles Do Natal or of the natiuitie, as likewise the three Isles of Comoro, with those of Alioa, of Spirito Santo, and of sant Christopher.</P>

Somewhat farther from the continent are situate the Isles of Pemba, Zanzibar, and Monfia inhabited by Negros; the grea∣test of which is Zanzibar, the prince whereof is called by the name of a king; and it lyeth vnder sixe degrees, of south latitude, being from the main ten leagues distant. But the soueraigne of all these Isles was Quiloa, inhabited like the rest, with Mahumetans of little bodies and abiect mindes. It aboun∣deth with rice, millet, cattel, woods of palme-trees, limons, orenges, &amp; sugar∣canes; where of notwithstanding they are ignorant how to make sugar. The city standeth vpon the sea-shore ouer against the firme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: it is built of
<PB N="49" REF="31"/>
pure marble, and the streetes are very narrow: a thing common among the Arabians, whereby they vse to defend themselues, after the enemie hath once entered their townes. From this Isle to Moçambique are about an hundred leagues. Without the porte lieth Misa, and three miles off Son∣go and Canga inhabited by Moores. Next follow As Ilhas do Açotatado, or The isles of the scourged, bicause here a certaine pilot that was a Moore, who had determined to wracke the whole fleete of <HI>Vasco da Gama,</HI> receiued punishment. Concerning Moçambique called by <HI>Ptolemey</HI> and other an∣cient writers Prassia, we haue intreated before. Fower miles from thence lie the desert isles of Saint George: and then the isles of Angoscia inhabited by Moores. These are stored with indifferent quantitie of victuals: and here<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plentie of Am∣bergrise.</NOTE> vpon an east winde they gather plentie of Ambergrise. An hundred and fif∣tie miles from Cabo dos corrientes, lieth A Ilha das vacas, or The isle of Cowes, with a castle thereupon, and store of good water. As Ilhas llanas, or The plaine isles are not woorth the speaking of. A Ilha da cruz, otherwise called Ilha das fontanhas, was the farthest limite of <HI>Bartholomew Diaz</HI> his nauigation, who was the first Portugale that euer doubled the cape of Bue∣na esprança, and hauing doubled it, returned backe without discouering any farther.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Isle of Saint Laurence, otherwise cal∣led Madagascar.</HEAD>
<P>THis isle called by the Portugales The isle of Sant Laurence, by the na∣turall inhabitans Madagascar, by <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> Magastar, by <HI>Ptole∣mey</HI> Menuthias, and by <HI>Plinie</HI> Cerne, is accounted one of the grea∣test, noblest, and richest in the whole world. About the midst thereof it ap∣procheth towards the maine of Africa, in forme of an elbowe, being distant from thence an hundred threescore and ten miles. The extreames of this isle are very farre separate from the saide maine, and especially that which stretcheth toward the northeast. The whole isle containeth in bredth fower hundred and fowerscore, in length one thousand two hundred, and in com∣passe fower thousand miles; so that in bignes it farre exceedeth Italy, though it be not so well inhabited and manured. Situate it is beyond the Equator in seuenteene degrees, and stretcheth from thence to sixe and twentie de∣grees and an halfe of southerly latitude. It is plentifully endowed with all things needfull for mans vse: for it yeeldeth cotton, Millet, Rice, Potatos, sweete orenges, sugar-canes, and sundry kindes of pulse: as likewise, amber, Iette, siluer, copper, red sanders, saffron, a spice somewhat like vnto cloues, and some quantitie of ginger. Moreouer, heere are lions, leopards, stags, roe-deere, goates, kine, sheepe, and other beastes both tame and wilde. Heere are likewise innumerable elephants, so that from hence is conueied great quantitie of iuorie. They haue also great store of camels, whose flesh the inhabitants eate for the holesomenes thereof. The people (except
<PB N="50" REF="32"/>
some few Moores vpon the coast) are idolaters, of colourblack, with curled haire, very barbarous, and in fashions resembling much the Cafres. They go naked all saue their priuities, which they couer with cloth of cotton: and they vse in the warre certaine crooked staues headed with bone. The Iesuits in their letters report, that in one part of this island there are white people found; who (as they affirme) are descended from the people of China; whereby may be gathered the great length of the Chinians nauigations, and the largenes of their empire. The Portugals sailing towards India in due time, do passe betweene this great isle and the firme land; but if the sea∣son groweth towards winter, they holde on their course (as themselues re∣port) on the backe side thereof. In these two courses of nauigation they haue found, and daily do discouer sundrie isles, but of small account, part whereof we haue mentioned before. Amongst others, as it were ouer a∣gainst Moçambique, lieth on a certaine strand or shold an isle called Lan∣gane of a reasonable bignes, with a great riuer therein, being inhabited by Moores. And the farthest toward the west are those isles which the Por∣tugals call Os Romeros. On the northeast part of this isle is the Bay of Antogill, being one of the safest and most commodious harbours in the world.</P>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and sundry freshets of excellent water. The soile is of a red colour, and like vnto ashes; it giueth way to ones footing like sand, and a man may shake euery tree vpon the isle. Heere the kings of Portugall haue enacted, that none may remaine to inhabite, except it be sometime two or three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> persons for the recouerie of their health; to the end that the fleets may heere plentifully and of free cost furnish themselues with fresh victuals, fruits, and water. So that when they arriue, they vsually plant or sow some one thing or other, which presently springeth and groweth to ripenes; and then the seed falling into the earth, it multiplieth of it selfe. Heere are woods of Ebàn and Cedar, with infinite store of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, orenges, and all sorts of fruits; as likewise hogs, geese, hens, partridges, feasants, Guinie-cocks, and other like creatures brought thither by the Portugals out of Europe, or from other countries.

<P>HArd vpon the firme land of the south part of Congo, is situate the isle of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Concerning this isle read more at large in the descrip∣tion of Congo.</NOTE> Loanda before mentioned. And ouer against the cape of Lopo Gonsalues in a manner, lieth the small isle of Nobon, being a rockie and desolate place, but of great importance for fishing; for which cause it is frequented by the inhabitants of Saint Thomas isle. This isle of Saint Thomas being an hundred and fower-score miles distant from the maine, is of a round forme, containing threescore Italian miles from side to side, and an hundred and fower-score miles also in compasse: of which isle (bicause it is situate iust vnder the Equinoctiall, so that the horizon thereof passeth by both the poles) it will not be from our purpose to intreat some∣what at large; to the end we may the better vnderstand the qualitie and tem∣perature of such places as are seated in that part of the world. This isle when it was first discouered was nothing else but a woode of vnprofitable trees, with their boughs turning crookedly vpward. The aire is extremely hot: in the moneths of March and September, when the sunne passeth perpendi∣cularly ouer, it raineth heere out of measure, and in other moneths heere falleth onely a moist dewe which watereth the ground. In the verie midst it hath a woodie mountaine, which is continually ouershadowed with a thick
<PB N="52" REF="33"/>
cloud, which cloud so moistneth the trees that grow in great abundance vp∣on this mountaine, that from hence droppeth water sufficient for the wate∣ring of al their fields of sugar-canes. By how much the sun is more perpen∣dicular ouer this isle, by so much is the aire more cloudie &amp; darke; and con∣trariwise, the farther it is distant from perpendicularitie, the cleerer and brighter is the skie. In the moneths of December, Ianuarie, and Februarie, such as are borne in Europe, can very hardly walke or mooue themselues for faintnes: and all the rest of the yeere, once in eight or ten daies, they seeme to be taken with an hot and a cold fit of an ague, which continueth vpon them for tow howers togither. They are thrice or oftner let bloud euerie yeere: and few of them liue aboue fiftie yeeres; but their Negros remaine more then an hundred yeers aliue. They which newly arriue there, are com∣monly surprized with a most dangerous feauer, which holdeth them for twentie daies togither. And these are let bloud, without any reckoning of ounces. Heereblow no windes at all, but onely from the southeast, south, and southwest, which windes stirre not in the moneths of December, Ianu∣arie, and Februarie, and therefore these moneths are most extremely hot. But in Iune, Iuly, and August, they blow a fresh gale. In this isle the French euill, and the scuruies are verie rife. The soile is of a meane colour betweene red and yellow, being clammie like claie, and by reason of the continuall nightly dewes, as soft and pliable as waxe, and of incredible fertility. Besides diuers other good ports, it hath one principall among the rest, belonging to the chiefe towne or citie called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or perhaps Pouaçaon, which (as I con∣iecture) may be all one with Poblacion in Spanish, which signifieth a Co∣lonie or towne.</NOTE> Pauoasan, consisting of aboue seuen hundred families, and inhabited by Portugals, and into the saide port run∣neth a little riuer of excellent water.</P>
<P>To euery of the Ingenios or sugar-houses (which in all may amount to the number of seuentie) do belong Negro-slaues, for the planting of their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seuentie Inge∣nios in San Tomé.</NOTE> canes and the dressing of their sugars, to some, two hundred, and to others, three hundred a piece, who liue vpon Maiz or Ghiny-wheat: the number of which slaues is so great, that oftentimes they rebell, to the great domage of the Portugals. They haue good sustenance also by meanes of a root, called there Igname, but in the west Indies Batata. Wheat that is heere sowen, groweth not to any ripenes or graine, but is resolued altogether into grasse. They make wine of the Palme-tree. Vines prosper nothing kindely in this place, except it be heere and there one, planted by an house-side, and atten∣ded with great diligence. They bring forth clusters at the same time, some ripe, some greene, and some blossomes onely; and they beare fruit twice in the yeere, as doe the fig-trees likewise. They haue sugar-canes ripe all the yeere long: but melons onely in Iune, Iuly, and August. No tree that bea∣reth fruit with a stone or kernell will fructifie or prosper in this place. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are found all ouer the Isle certaine crabs or creuises like vnto them of the sea; heere be likewise gray parots, and infinite other birds of diuers sortes; and in the sea are mightie store of whales, especially toward the firme land. The principall riches of this isle consist in sugars, whereof there groweth
<PB N="53" REF="33"/>
great abundance. The sugar-canes are planted and cut euery moneth, and in fiue months they grow to ripenes, but by reason of the moistnes of the ayer, they neither prooue hard nor white, but are of a reddish colour. The tenths which belong to the king amount to the number of 12. or 14. thousand Ar∣rouas, euery Arroua being one and thirtie Italian pound-weight. In times past there were fortie ships yeerely laden therewith; but now of late certaine wormes which eat the roots of the canes, or (as others think) white antes or mise, haue so mightily impaired the growth of this commodity, that now there are not aboue sixe ships laden therewith. The sugar-canes, after they be once ground, they giue vnto their hogges, wherewith they prooue fat, and their flesh is very sauory. For returne of sugars, the merchants of Eu∣rope carry thither meale, wine, swordes, oile, cheese, hides, drinking-glasses, and certaine shels, which there and in the countries adioining they vse in∣steed of mony. Of the coniunction betweene the men of Europe and the Negro women are bred a generation of browne or tawnie people.</P>

<P>NExt vnto Cape verde it selfe stand The Barbacene which are seuen small isles replenished with greene trees, and full of strange birds vn∣knowne to vs; and yet are they vtterly voide of inhabitants. But those that are called the isles of Cape verde (which by ancient authors are thought to haue bin named Gorgones, or Gorgades, or Hesperides) are nine in number, and are fituate betweene Cabo verde and Cabo blanco. They were first discouered by <HI>Antonio di Nolli</HI> a Genoway, and began in like sort to be peopled, in the yeere of our Lord 1440. Albeit there are none of them now inhabited, but onely the isle of Sant Iago, and Isla del fo go or The bur∣ning isle. The principall of them all is Sant Iago being seuentie miles long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This towne was taken by sir Francis Drake 1585. and by sir <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sherley 1596.</NOTE> whereon the Portugals haue a faire and strong towne called Ribera gran∣de, with a riuer running through it, and a commodious and secure hauen: it is very strongly seated betweene two mountaines, and consisteth of fiue hundred families at the least. The riuer (which springeth two leagues from the city) is beautified vpon the bankes thereof with Cedars, Orenge-trees, and diuers other plants, amongst which the Palme tree of India that beareth nuts, prospereth exceeding well. The hearbes of Europe grow here as natu∣rally as in their original soile; howbeit the seeds thereof must euery yeere be brought out of Spaine. The isle is generally vneuen and mountainous: but the valleis are passing fertile, and throughly inhabited: and here is sowed abundance of rice and Saburro, which groweth to ripenes in fortie daies. Howbeit the soile will beare no wheat. Here is store of cotton also, the cloth whereof is dispersed along the coast of Africa. The shee-gotes here, as like∣wise in all the isles adiacent, bring forth three and more kids at a birth, euery foure moneths. When the sunne is in Cancer, it raineth here in a manner without ceasing.</P>
<P>To the west of Sant Iago stand the isles of Fogo and Braua being but of small importance (albeit that of Fogo is in some parts thereof inhabited) and to the North of the same is situate the isle of Maio, where there is a lake of two leagues long, which is full of salt; the which is a common thing in all these islands; but in one, more then in any of the other, in that it is full of such like salt pits, and is therefore called The island of salt, being destitute of all other liuing things, saue onely of wild gotes. The isle of Buena vista hath a name contrary to the quality; for it is without all shew of beauty. Of the others I haue nothing woorthie the obseruation.</P>

Heere the king of Spaine hath a fortresse, for the traffique of gold and other rich commodities of those countries. These isles are sixe or seuen in number, all little ones, being inhabited by the Azanaghi, who liue of fish, whereof there is plentie in that baie.

Amongst other beasts they haue also camels. The natural inhabi∣tants of the countrey are of a good disposition, and notable agilitie; but be∣fore they were discouered, they were so grosse and rude, as they knewe not the vse of fire. They beleeued in one creatour of the world, who punished the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and rewarded the good; and in this point they all consented, but in other matters they were very different.

Tenerif is not altogither so great.

Hierro hath neither spring nor well, but is mira∣culously furnished with water by a cloud which ouer-spreadeth a tree, from whence distilleth so much moisture, as sufficeth both for men and cattell. This cloud ariseth an hower or two before the sunne, and is dissolued two howers after sunne rising. The water falleth into a ponde made at the foote of the tree. The isle of Palma is little, but beautifull, and abundant in sugar, wine, flesh, and cheese: wherefore such ships as go from Spaine to Ter∣ra firma, and Brasil, do there ordinarily prouide themselues of fresh victuall.

So it is called, because at the first discouerie thereof it was all ouergrowen with mightie thick woods. Wherfore, to waste the said woods, and to make it fit to be manured, the first discouerers set them on fire, which continued burning (as some re∣port) for the space of certaine yeeres together: whereupon it grew so excee∣ding fertile, that of corne it yeeldeth sixtie folde for one: and for a certaine space the fifte part of the sugars amounted yeerely to threescore thousand Arrouas (one of which Arrouas containeth fiue and twentie pounds of six∣teene ounces the pound) but now it cometh not to the one halfe of that rec∣koning. This isle containeth in compasse an hundred &amp; sixtie miles. It is di∣ded into foure regions or quarters, that is to say Comerico, Santa Cruz, Funcial, and Camara de los Lobos. It aboundeth with water: and besides di∣uiuers &amp; sundry fountaines, it hath eight small riuers which make it as fruit∣full and pleasant as a garden. It yeeldeth euery thing in such perfection, that <HI>Cadamosta</HI> (in regard of their excellency) affirmeth all commodities which are there gathered, to be gold.

This isle is very scarce of oile and of corne. The head or principall citie hereof is Funciall, being the seat of an archbishop who hath 8000. ducates of reuenue.

<P>OVR authors affirme, that Africa is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into fower partes, that is to say, Barbaria, Numidia, Libya, and the lande of Negros. Barbaria taketh beginning from the hill called Meies, which is the extreme part of all the moun∣taines of Atlas, being distant from Alexandria almost three hundred miles. It is bounded on the North side with the Mediter∣ran sea, stretching thence to mount-Meies aforesaid, and from mount∣Meies extending itselfe to the streites of Gibraltar. Westward it is limi∣ted with the said streites, from whence winding it selfe out of the Medi∣terran sea into the maine Ocean, it is inclosed with the most westerly point of Atlas: namely, at that Westerne cape which is next vnto the towne called Messa. And southward it is bounded with that side of Atlas which lieth towards the Mediterran sea. This is the most noble and wor∣thie region of all Africa, the inhabitants whereof are of a browne or taw∣nie colour, being a ciuill people, and prescribe wholsome lawes and con∣stitutions vnto themselues.</P>
<P>The second part of Africa is called of the Latines <HI>Numidia,</HI> but of the Arabians <HI>Biledulgerid:</HI> this region bringeth foorth dates in great abun∣dance.

<P>The third part called of the Latines <HI>Libya,</HI> and of the Arabians <HI>Sarra</HI> (which word signifieth a desert) beginneth eastward at that part of Nilus which is next vnto the citie of Eloacat, and from thence runneth west∣ward as far as the Ocean sea.

<P>The fourth part of Africa which is called the land of Negros, begin∣neth eastward at the kingdome of Gaoga, from whence it extendeth west as far as Gualata. The north part thereof is inclosed with the desert of Libya, and the south part, which is vnknowen vnto vs, with the Ocean sea: howbeit the merchants which daily come from thence to the king∣dome of Tombuto, haue sufficiently described the situation of that coun∣trie vnto vs. This lande of Negros hath a mightie riuer, which taking his<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Niger.</NOTE> name of the region, is called Niger: this riuer taketh his originall from the east out of a certaine desert called by the foresaide Negros <HI>Seu.</HI> Others will haue this riuer to spring out of a certaine lake, and so to run

Our Cosmogra∣phers affirme, that the said riuer of Niger is deriued out of Nilus, which they imagine for some certaine space to be swallowed vp of the earth, and yet at last to burst foorth into such a lake as is before mentioned. Some others are of opinion, that this riuer beginneth westward to spring out of a certaine mountaine, and so running east, to make at length a huge lake: which verily is not like to be true; for they vsually saile westward from Tombuto to the kingdome of Ginea, yea and to the land of Melli also; both which in respect of Tombuto are situate to the west: neither hath the said land of Negros any kingdomes comparable, for beautifull and pleasant soile, vnto those which adioine vnto the bankes of Niger.

<HEAD>Of the habitations of Africa, and of the signification of this word Barbar.</HEAD>
<P>OVr Cosmographers and historiographers affirme, that in times past Africa was altogether disinhabited, except that part which is now called the land of Negros: and most certaine it is, that Barbarie and Numidia were for many ages destitute of inhabitants. The tawnie people of the said region were called by the name of <HI>Barbar,</HI> being deriued of the verbe <HI>Barbara,</HI> which in their toong signifieth to murmur: because the African
<PB N="6" REF="40"/>
toong soundeth in the eares of the Arabians, no otherwise then the voice of beasts, which vtter their sounds without any accents. Others will haue <HI>Barbar</HI> to be one word twise repeated, forsomuch as <HI>Bar</HI> in the Arabian toong signifieth a desert. For (say they) when king <HI>Iphricus</HI> being by the Assyrians or Aethiopians driuen out of his owne kingdome, trauelled towards Aegypt, and seeing himselfe so oppressed with his enimies, that he knew not what should become of him and his followers, he asked his people how or which way it was possible to escape, who answered him <HI>Bar-Bar,</HI> that is, to the desert, to the desert: giuing him to vnderstand by this speech, that he could haue no safer refuge, then to crosse ouer Nilus, and to flee vnto the desert of Africa. And this reason seemeth to agree with them, which affirme the Africans to be descended from the people of Arabia foelix.</P>

<HEAD>The originall of the people of Africa.</HEAD>
<P>ABout the originall of the Africans, our historiographers doe much disagree. For some will haue them to be deri∣ued from the inhabitants of Palaestina; because (as they say) being expelled out of their owne countrie by the Assyrians, they came at length into Africa, &amp; seeing the fruitfulnes of the soile, chose it to be their place of habitation. Others are of opinion, that they tooke their originall from the Sabeans a people of Arabia foelix, and that, before such time as they were put to flight by the Assyrians or Aethiopians, as hath beene aforesaid. Some others report, that the Africans descended from certaine people of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Fortè Asia minor.</NOTE> Asia, who being chased thence by reason of warres which were waged against them, fled into Greece, which at the same time had no inhabitants at all. Howbeit the enimie still pursuing them, they were forced to crosse the sea of Mo∣rea, and being arriued in Africa, to settle themselues there: but their eni∣mies aboad still in Greece. All which opinions and reportes are to bee vnderstood onely of the originall of the tawnie people, that is to say, of the Numidians and Barbarians. For all the Negros or blacke Moores take their descent from <HI>Chus,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Cham,</HI> who was the sonne of <HI>Noë.</HI> But whatsoeuer difference there be betweene the Negros and the tawnie Moores, certaine it is that they had all one beginning.

<HEAD>A diuision of the tawnie Moores into sundrie tribes or nations.</HEAD>
<P>THE tawnie Moores are diuided into fiue seuerall people or tribes: to wit, the tribes called Zanhagi, Musmudi, Zeneti, Hacari, and Gumeri. The tribe of Musmudi inhabite the westerne part of mount Atlas, from the prouince of Hea to the riuer of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Guadalhabit.</NOTE> Seruan. Likewise they dwell vpon the south part of the said mountaine, and vpon all the inward plaines of that region. These Musmudae haue fower prouinces vnder them: namely, Hea, Sus, Guzula, and the territorie of Marocco. The tribe of Gumeri possesse certaine mountaines of Barbarie, dwelling on the sides of those mountaines which lie ouer against the Mediterran sea: as like∣wise they are Lords of all the riuer called in their language <HI>Rif.</HI> This riuer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tremizen cal∣led by the an∣cient Cosmo∣graphers Cae∣saria or Mau∣ritania Caesari∣ensis.</NOTE> hath his fountaine neere vnto the streites of Gibraltar, and thence run∣neth eastwards to the kingdome of Tremizen, called by the Latines <HI>Cae∣saria.</HI></P>
<P>These two tribes or people haue seuerall habitations by themselues: the other three are dispersed confusiuely ouer all Africa: howbeit they are, like strangers, discerned one from another by certaine properties or tokens, maintaining continuall warre among themselues, especially they of Numidia. These (I say) are those very people (as some report) who had no other places then tents and wide fields to repose themselues in: and it is reported, that in times past they had great conflicts together, and that the vanquished were sent to inhabit townes and cities, but the con∣querors held the champions and fieldes vnto themselues, and there setled their aboad. Neither is it altogether vnlikely; because the inhabitants of cities haue all one and the same language with the countrie people. For the Zeneti, whether they dwell in the citie or in the countrie, speake all one kinde of language: which is likewise to be vnderstood of the rest. The tribes of Zeneti, Haoari, and Sanhagi; inhabit the countrie of Temesne: sometimes they liue peaceably, and sometimes againe, calling to minde their ancient quarrels, they breake foorth into cruell warres and man∣slaughters. Some of these people beare rule ouer all Africa, as namely the Zeneti, who in times past vanquished the familie called Idris; from which some affirme the true and naturall Dukes of Fez, and the founders of the same citie to deriue their petigree: their progenie likewise was called Mecnasa. There came afterward out of Numidia, another familie of the Zeneti called Magraoa: this Magraoa chased the familie of Mec∣nasa with all their Dukes and chieftaines out of their dominions. Not long after, the said tribe of Magraoa was expelled in like sort by certaine others of the race of the Sanhagij, called by the name of Luntuna, which
<PB N="8" REF="41"/>
came also out of the desert of Numidia.</P>
<P>By this familie was the countrie of Temesna in processe of time vt∣terly spoiled and wasted, and all the inhabitants thereof slaine, except those which were of their owne tribe and kindred of Luntuna, vnto whom was allotted the region of Ducala to inhabit, and by them was built the citie commonly called Maroco. It fell out afterwards by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who were the founders of Maroco.</NOTE> inconstancie of fortune, that one <HI>Elmahdi</HI> the principall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> preacher among them, conspiring with the Hargij (these Hargij were of the familie of Musmuda) expelled the whole race of the Luntuna, and vsurped that kingdome vnto himselfe. After this mans decease, succeeded in his place one of his disciples called <HI>Habdul Mumen a Banigueriaghel</HI> of the kindred of the Sanhagij. The kingdome remained vnto this family about an 120. yeeres, whereunto all Africa in a manner was subiect: At length being deposed by the Banimarini, a generation of the Zeneti, the said familie was put to flight: which Banimarini are said to haue raig∣ned afterward for the space of 170. yeeres. The Banimarini which de∣scended of the Sanhagij and of Magroa, waged continuall warre against <HI>Banizeijan</HI> the king of Telensin: likewise the progenie of Hafasa, and of Musmuda are at variance and dissension with the king of Tunis. So that you see what stirres and tumults haue at all times beene occasioned in those regions by the foresaid fiue families.</P>
<P>Certaine it is, that neither the Gumeri, nor the Haoari haue at this present any iurisdiction at all; albeit heretofore (as we reade in their chronicles) they had some certaine dominion, before such time as they were infected with the Mahumetan lawe. Out of all which it is euident, that in times past all the foresaid people had their habitations and tents in the plaine fields: euery one of which fauoured their owne faction, and exercised all labours necessarie for mans life, as common among them. The gouernours of the countrie attended their droues and flockes; and the citizens applied themselues vnto some manuall art, or to husbandrie. The said people are diuided into fiue hundred seuerall families, as appee∣reth by the genealogies of the Africans, author whereof is one <HI>Ibnu Ra∣chu,</HI> whom I haue oftentimes read and perused. Some writers are of opi∣nion, that the king of Tombuto, the king of Melli, and the king of Aga∣dez fetch their originall from the people of Zanaga, to wit, from them which inhabite the desert.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="41"/>
true and naturall language of the Africans. Howbeit it is altogether different from other languages, although it hath diuers words common with the Arabian toong; whereupon some would inferre, that the Afri∣cans (as is aboue said) came by lineall descent from the Sabeans, a people of Arabia foelix. Others say, that these words were euen then inuented when the Arabians came first into Africa, and began to take possession thereof: but these authors were so rude and grosse-witted, that they left no writings behinde them, which might be alleaged either for, or against. Moreouer they haue among them another diuersitie, not onely of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but of significant words also: as namely, they which dwell neere vnto the Arabians, and exercise much traffique with them, doe for the greater part vse their language. Yea, all the Gumeri in a manner, and most of the Haoari speake Arabian, though corruptly; which (I suppose) came first hereupon to passe, for that the said people haue had long ac∣quaintance and conuersation with the Arabians. The Negros haue diuers languages among themselues, among which they call one <HI>Sungai,</HI> and the same is current in many regions; as namely, in Gualata, Tom∣buto, Ghinea, Melli, and Gago. Another language there is among the Negros, which they cal <HI>Guber;</HI> &amp; this is rife among the people of Guber, of Cano, of Casena, of Perzegreg, &amp; of Guangra. Likewise the kingdom of Borno hath a peculiar kinde of speech, altogether like vnto that, which is vsed in Gaoga. And the kingdome of Nube hath a language of great affinitie with the Chaldean, Arabian, &amp; Egyptian toongs. But all the sea∣towns of Africa frō the Mediterran sea to the mountains of Atlas, speake broken Arabian. Except the kingdome and towne of Maroco, &amp; the in∣land Numidians bordering vpon Maroco, Fez, &amp; Tremizen; all which, vse the Barbarian toong. Howbeit they which dwel ouer against Tunis &amp; Tripoli, speake indeede the Arabian language; albeit most corruptly.</P>

After the death of which rebell, that king∣dome remained for some yeeres vnto his posteritie and familie; whose iurisdiction (as the African chronicles report) grew so large and strong in the time of <HI>Elcain</HI> (the Mahumetan Califa and patriark of Arabia) that he sent vnto them one <HI>Gehoar,</HI> whom of a slaue he had made his coun∣sellour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gehoar a slaue by condition, conquered all Barbarie, Nu∣midia, Egypt, and Syria.</NOTE> with an huge armie. This <HI>Gehoar</HI> conducting his armie west∣ward, recouered all Numidia and Barbarie. Insomuch that he pierced vnto the region of Sus, and there claimed most ample tribute: all which being done, he returned backe vnto his Calipha, and most faithfully surrendred vnto him whatsoeuer he had gained from the enemie. The Calipha seeing his prosperous successe, began to aspire vnto greater ex∣ploites. And <HI>Gehoar</HI> most firmely promised, that as he had recouered that westerne dominion vnto his Lord, so would he likewise by force of warre most certainly restore vnto him the countries of the East, to wit, Egypt, Syria, and all Arabia; and protested moreouer that with the greatest hazard of his life, he would be auenged of all the iniuries offered by the familie of <HI>Labhus</HI> vnto his Lords predecessors, and would reuest him in the royall seate of his most famous grandfathers, great-grandfa∣thers, and progenitors. The Calipha liking well his audacious promise, caused an armie of fower-score thousand soldiers, with an infinite summe of money and other things necessarie for the warres, to be deliuered vnto him. And so this valiant and stout chieftaine being prouided for warfare, conducted his troupes through the deserts of Aegypt &amp; Barbarie; &amp; ha∣uing first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to flight the vice-Califa of Aegypt (who fled vnto <HI>Eluir</HI> the
<PB N="11" REF="42"/>
Califa of Bagdet) in short time he subdued very easily all the prouinces of Aegypt and Syria. Howbeit he could not as yet hold himselfe secure; fearing least the Califa of Bagdet would assaile him with an armie out of Asia, and least the garrisons which he had left to keepe Barbarie, should be constrained to forsake those conquered prouinces. Wherefore hee built <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and caused it to be walled round about. In which citie he left one of his most trustie captaines, with a great part of the armie: and this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gehoar the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Cairo.</NOTE> citie he called by the name of Alchair, which afterward by others was named Cairo. This Alchair is saide daily so to haue increased, that no citie of the world for buildings and inhabitants was any way comparable thereunto. Now when <HI>Gehoar</HI> perceiued that the Calipha of Bagdet made no preparation for warre, he foorthwith wrote vnto his Lord, that all the conquered cities yeelded due honour vnto him, and that all things were in quiet and tranquillitie: and therefore, that himselfe (if he thought good) should come ouer into Aegypt, and thereby with his onely pre∣sence should preuaile more to recouer the remnant of his dominions, then with neuer so huge an armie: for he was in good hope that the Ca∣lipha of Bagdet hearing of his expedition, woulde leaue his kingdome and prelacie, and would betake himselfe to flight. This notable and ioy∣full message no sooner came to the eares of Califa <HI>Elcain;</HI> but he being by his good fortune much more encouraged then before, and not fore∣thinking himselfe, what mischiefe might ensue, leuied a great armie, ap∣pointing for vice-roy of all Barbarie one of the familie of Sanagia afore∣said, finding him afterward not to be his trustie friend. Moreouer Califa <HI>Elcain</HI> arriuing at Alchair, and being most honorably entertained by his seruant <HI>Gehoar,</HI> began to thinke vpon great affaires, and hauing gathered an huge armie, resolued to wage battell against the Califa of Bagdet. In the meane season he that was appointed vice-roy of Barbarie compa∣cting with the Calipha of Bagdet, yeelded himselfe and all Barbarie into his hands. Which the Califa most kindly accepted, and ordained him king ouer all Africa. But Califa <HI>Elcain</HI> hearing this newes at Alchair was woonderfully afflicted in minde; partly because he saw himselfe repelled from his owne kingdome, and partly for that he had spent all his money which hee brought with him: insomuch that he knew not what in the world to doe, determining some seuere punishment for <HI>Gehoar,</HI> by whose counsell he left his kingdome of Arabia. Howbeit there was one of his secret counsellers a very learned and wittie man, who seeing his Lord so sad and pensiue, and being desirous by some good aduise to preuent the danger imminent, comforted him in this wise: Your highnes knoweth (most inuincible Califa) that fortune is most variable, and that the cou∣rage of your soldiers is no whit daunted by reason of these mishaps. For mine owne part, as I haue heretofore shewed my selfe to be your trustie seruant, so will I at this time giue you such profitable counsell, whereby you may within short space recouer all those dominions which haue
<PB N="12" REF="43"/>
beene so treacherously taken from you, and may without al peraduenture most easily attaine vnto your owne harts desire. And this you may doe without maintaining any armie at all; yea, I assure you, if you please to take mine aduise, that I will foorthwith procure you such an armie, as shall giue you great store of money, and yet notwithstanding shall doe you good seruice also. The Califa being somewhat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these speeches, asked his counsellour how this might possibly be brought to effect: My Lord (saith his counseller) certaine it is, that the Arabians are now growen so populous and to so great a number, that all Arabia can∣not containe them, scarcely wil the yeerely increase of the ground suffice to feede their droues, and you see with what great famine they are afflic∣ted, and how they are destitute not onely of habitations, but euen of vic∣tuals and sustenance. Wherefore if you had heeretofore giuen them leaue, they would long ere this haue inuaded Africa. And if you will now licence them so to doe, doubt you not, but that you shall receiue of them an huge masse of golde. This counsell could not altogether satisfie the Califa his minde: for he knew right well that the Arabians would so waste all Africa, as it should neither bee profitable for himselfe, nor for his enemies. Notwithstanding, seeing that his kingdome was altogether endangered, hee thought it better to accept those summes of money which his counsellour promised, and so to be reuenged of his enemie, then to lose both his kingdome and gold all at once. Wherefore hee permitted all Arabians, which would pay him ducats apeece, freely to enter Africa; conditionally that they would shewe themselues most deadly enemies vnto the treacherous king of Barbarie. Which libertie<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ten tribes of Arabians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Africa.</NOTE> being granted vnto them, it is reported that ten tribes or families of Ara∣bians, being halfe the people of Arabia deserta, came immediately into Africa; vnto whom certaine inhabitants of Arabia foelix ioyned them∣selues, insomuch that there were found amongst them about fiftie thou∣sand persons able to beare armes: their women, children, and cattell were<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rachu a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>.</NOTE> almost innumerable: the storie whereof <HI>Ibnu Rachu,</HI> the most diligent chronicler of African affaires (whom we haue before mentioned) setteth downe at large. These Arabians hauing trauersed the desert betweene Aegypt and Barbarie, first laid siege vnto Tripolis a citie of Barbarie, which being ouercome, they slew a great part of the citizens, the residue escaping by flight. Next of all they encountred the towne of Capes, which was by them taken and vanquished. At length they besieged Cai∣raoan also; howbeit the citizens being sufficiently prouided of victuals, are said to haue indured the siege for eight monethes: which being ex∣pired, they were constrained to yeeld: at what time there was nothing in Cairaoan but wofull slaughters, hideous outcries, and present death. This land the Arabians diuided among themselues, and began to people and inhabite the same; requiring in the meane space large tributes of the townes and prouinces subiect vnto them. And so they possessed all
<PB N="13" REF="43"/>
Africa, vntill such time as one <HI>Ioseph</HI> the sonne of <HI>Ieffin</HI> attained to the king∣dom of Marocco. This <HI>Ioseph</HI> was the first king of Marocco, who endeuored by all meanes to aduance the friends and kinred of the late deceased king of Africa vnto the kingdome; neither did he cease vntill he had expelled all the Arabians out of Cairaoan. Howbeit the Arabians possessed the regions thereabout, giuing themselues wholy to spoiles and robberies: and the friends of the said deceased king could beare rule but in certaine places only. Afterward succeeded in the kingdome of Marocco one <HI>Mansor,</HI> who was the fourth king and prelate of that Mahumetan sect which was called <HI>Mua∣chedim.</HI> This man, albeit his grand-fathers &amp; great grand-fathers had alwaies fauoured the posteritie and friends of the foresaid deceased African king, and had restored them to their ancient dignitie; deuised altogether how to oppose himselfe against them, and to vsurpe all their authoritie. Wherefore making a fained league with them, we reade, that he prouoked the Arabians against them, and so very easily ouercame them. Afterward <HI>Mansor</HI> brought the greatest part of the Arabians into the westerne dominions of Africa; vnto the better sort of whom he gaue the habitation of Duccala &amp; Azgara, and vnto the baser remnant he bequeathed the possession of Numidia. But in processe of time he commanded the Numidian slaues to be set at liber∣tie, and so in despight of the Arabians, he caused them to inhabite that part of Numidia which he had allotted vnto them. But as for the Arabians of Azgara and of certaine other places in Barbarie, he brought them all vnder his subiection. For the Arabians out of deserts are like fishes without water: they had indeede often attempted to get into the deserts; but the moun∣taines of Atlas, which were then possessed by the Barbarians, hindred their passage. Neither had they libertie to passe ouer the plaines, for the residue of the Barbarians were there planted. Wherefore their pride being abated, they applied themselues vnto husbandrie, hauing no where to repose them∣selues, but onely in villages, cottages, and tents. And their miserie was so much the greater, in that they were constrained yeerely to disburse vnto the king of Marocco most ample tribute. Those which inhabited Duccala, be∣cause they were an huge multitude, easily freed themselues from all tribute, and imposition. A great part of the Arabians remained still at Tunis, for that <HI>Mansor</HI> had refused to carie them along with him: who, after the death of the said <HI>Mansor,</HI> grew to be Lords of Tunis, and so continued, till they resigned their gouernment vnto the people called Abu-Haf; vpon condi∣tion that they should pay them halfe the reuenues thereof: and this condi∣tion hath remained firme euen vntill our daies. Howbeit, because the Ara∣bians are increased to such innumerable swarmes, that the whole reuenues are not sufficient for them, the king of Tunis most iustly alloweth some of<NOTE PLACE="marg">1526.</NOTE> them their duties, to the end they may make secure passage for merchants, which indeede they performe without molestation or hurt of any. But the residue which are depriued of their pay, betake themselues wholy to robbe∣ries, thefts, slaughters, and such other monstrous outrages. For these, lurking

And so they passe sometimes to their great inconuenience. For they are notwithstanding constrained to giue vnto the foresaid Arabians, which are in pay with the king of Tunis, great summes of money: and are likewise oftentimes so in danger of robbers, that they lose both their goods &amp; liues.</P>

<HEAD>Adiuision of the Arabians which inhabite Africa, and are called by the name of Barbarians, into diuers progenies or kinreds.</HEAD>
<P>THE Arabians which inhabite Africa are diuided into three partes: one part whereof are called Cachin, the second Hilell, and the third Machill. The Cachin are diuided into three nations or tribes; to wit, the tribes of Etheg, Sumait, and Sahid. Moreouer Etheg is diuided into three families; that is to say, the familie of Delleg, Elmuntefig, and Subair: and these are dispersed into many regions. Hilel are deriued into fower generations; to wit, the people of Benihemir, of Rieh, of Sufien, and of Chusain. The familie of Benihemir is diuided into the linages of Huroam, Hucben, Habrum and Mussim. The tribe of Rieh are distributed into the kinreds called Deuvad, Suaid, Asgeg, Elcherith, Enedri, and Garfam; which kinreds possesse many dominions. Machil haue three tribes vnder them: to wit, Mastar, Hutmen, and Hassan. Mastar are diuided into Ruchen, and Selim; Hutmen into Elhasi and Chi∣nan; and Hassan into Deuihessen, Deuimansor, and Deuihubaidulla. Deui∣hessen is distinguished into the kinreds called Dulein, Berbun, Vodein, Rac∣men and Hamram; Deuimansor into Hemrun, Menebbe, Husein, and Al∣buhusein; and lastly Deuihubaidulla, into Garag, Hedeg, Teleb, and Geoan. All these doe in a manner possesse innumerable regions; insomuch that to reckon them vp at large, were a matter not onely difficult, but almost im∣possible.</P>

<HEAD>Of the habitations and number of the foresaid Arabians.</HEAD>
<P>THE most noble and famous Arabians were they of the familie of Etheg, vnto whome <HI>Almansor</HI> gaue the regions of Duccala and of Tedles to inhabit. These Arabians euen till our times haue beene put to great distresse and hazard, partly by the Portugall king, and partly by the king of Fez. They haue at all oportunities, if need should require, a hundred thousand soldiers fit to beare armes, a great part whereof are horsemen. The Arabians called Sumait enioy that part of the Libyan desert which lieth ouer against the desert of Tripoly. These make often inuasions into Bar∣barie,
<PB N="15" REF="44"/>
for they haue no places allotted them therein, but they and their ca∣mels doe perpetually remaine in the deserts. They are able to leuie fower∣score thousand soldiers, the greatest part being footmen. Likewise the tribe of Sahid doe inhabite the desert of Libya: and these haue had alwaies great league and familiaritie with the king of Guargala. They haue such abun∣dance of cattell, that they doe plentifully supply all the cities of that region with flesh, and that especially in sommer time, for all the winter they stirre not out of the deserts. Their number is increased to about a hundred and fif∣tie thousand, hauing not many horsemen among them. The tribe of Delleg possesse diuers habitations, howbeit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> Caesaria containeth the greatest part of them. Some also inhabit vpon the frontiers of the kingdome of Bugia; who are said to receiue a yeerely stipend from their next neighbours. But the least part of them dwell vpon the field-countrey of Acdes, vpon the borders of Mauritania, and vpon some part of mount Atlas, being subiect vnto the king of Fez. The people of Elmuntefig are seated in the prouince of Azgar, and are called by the later writers Elcaluth. These also pay certaine yeerely tribute vnto the King of Fez, beeing able to furnish about eight thousand horsemen to the warres. The kindred of Sobair doe inhabit not farre from the kingdome of Gezeir, being many of them vnder the pay of the king of Tremizen, and are said to enioy a great part of Numidia. They haue, more or lesse, three thousand most warlike horsemen. They possesse likewise great abundance of camels; for which cause they abide all winter in the deserts. The remnant of them occupieth the plaine which lieth be∣tweene Sala and Mecnes. These haue huge droues of cattell, and exercise themselues in husbandrie, being constrained to pay some yeerely tribute vnto the king of Fez. They haue horsemen, who, as a man may say, are na∣turally framed to the warres, about fower thousand in number.</P>

The tribe of Hurua possesse onely the borders of Mustuganim. These are sauage people, giuing themselues wholy to spoiles and robberies, and alienating their mindes from the warres. They neuer come foorth of the deserts; for the people of Barbarie will neither allow them any places of habitation, nor yet any stipend at all: horsemen they haue to the number of two thousand. The kindred of Hucban are next neighbours vnto the region of Melian, who receiue certaine pay from the king of Tunis. They are rude and wilde people, and in very deede estranged from al humanitie: they haue (as it is reported) about fifteene hundred horse∣men.

<P>The people called Mussim possesse those deserts of Masila which extend vnto the kingdome of Bugia. These likewise are giuen onely to theft and robberie; they take tribute both of their owne people, and of other regions adioyning vnto them. The tribe of Rieeh inhabite those deserts of Libya which border vpon Constantina. These haue most ample dominions in Numidia, being now diuided into sixe parts. This right famous and warlike nation receiueth stipende from the king of Tunis, hauing fiue thousande horsemen at command. The people of Suaid enioy that desert, which is ex∣tended vnto the signiorie of Tenez. These haue very large possessions, re∣ceiuing stipend from the king of Tremizen, being men of notable dexteri∣tie, as well in the warres as in all other conuersation of life. The kindred of Azgeg dwell not all together in one place: for part of them inhabite the region of Garet among the people called Hemram: and the residue poslesse that part of Duccala which lieth neere vnto Azaphi. The tribe of Elcherit dwell vpon that portion of Helin which is situate in the plaine of Sahidim, hauing the people of Heah tributarie vnto them, and being a very vnciuill and barbarous people. The people called Enedri are seated in the plaine of Heah: but the whole region of Heah maintaineth almost fower thousand horsemen; which notwithstanding are vnfit for the warres. The people of Garfa haue sundrie mansions; neither haue they any king or gouernour. They are dispersed among other generations, and especially among the kindreds of Manebbi and Hemram.

And you shall finde scarce any one man among them, which will not outgoe a very swift horse; be the iourney neuer so long. They haue about fiue hundred horsemen; but most warlike foote∣men, to the number of eight thousand. Selim inhabite vpon the riuer of Dara; from whence they range vp and downe the deserts.

for all oportunities of warre they haue euer in a readines three thousande horsemen. The tribe of Elhasis dwelleth vpon the sea-coast neere vnto Messa. They doe arme about fiue hundred horsemen, and are a nation alto∣gether rude and vnacquainted in the warres. Some part of them inhabiteth Azgara. Those which dwell about Messa are free from the yoke of superio∣ritie, but the others which remaine in Azgar are subiect to the king of Fez. The kindred of Chinan are dispersed among them which before were called Elcaluth, and these also are subiect vnto the king of Fez. Very warlike peo∣ple they are; and are able to set foorth two thousand horsemen. The people of Deuihessen are diuided into the kindreds of Duleim, Burbun, Vode, De∣uimansor, and Deuihubaidulla. Duleim are conuersant in the deserts of Libya with the African people called Zanhaga. They haue neither domi∣nion nor yet any stipend; wherefore they are very poore and giuen to rob∣berie: they trauell vnto Dara, and exchange cattell for dates with the inha∣bitants there. All brauerie &amp; comelines of apparell they vtterly neglect; and their number of fighting menis ten thousand, fower thousand being horse∣men and the residue footmen. The people called Burbun possesse, that part of the Libyan desert, which adioyneth vnto Sus. They are a huge multitude, neither haue they any riches beside camels. Vnto them is subiect the citie of Tesset, which scarce sufficeth them for the maintenance of their horses, being but a few. The people of Vode enioyeth that desert, which is situate betweene Guaden and Gualata. They beare rule ouer the Guadenites, and of the Duke of Gualata they receiue yeerely tribute, and their number is growen almost infinite For by report they are of abilitie to bring into the field almost threescore thousand most skilful soldiers; notwithstanding they haue great want of horses. The tribe of Racmen occupie that desert which is next vnto Hacha. They haue very large possessions, and doe in the spring∣time vsually trauell vnto Tesset: for then alwaies they haue somewhat to doe with the inhabitants there. Their people fit for armes are to the number of twelue thousand; albeit they haue very few horsemen. The nation of Ham∣rum inhabit the deserts of Tagauost, exacting some tribute of the inhabi∣tants there, and with daily incursions likewise molesting the people of Nun.

There dwell likewise among these certaine other Arabians of more base condition, called in their language <HI>Garfa Esgeh;</HI> which not∣withstanding haue great abundance of horses and of all other cattell.

In summer they disperse themselues all ouer the prouince of Garet, possessing the east part of Mauritania. They are noble and honest persons, and endued with all kinde of humanitie and ciuilitie; insomuch that all the kings of Fez in a manner do vsually chuse them wiues out of the same tribe; needes therefore must there be great friendship and familiaritie among them. The people of Menebbe doe almost inhabite the very same desert, hauing two prouinces of Numidia vnder them; to wit, Matgara, and Retebbe. These also are a most valiant nation, being in pay vn∣der the prouince of Segelmess, and being able to make about two thousand horsemen. The kindred of Husein, which are thought to be descended of Deuimansor, are seated vpon the mountaines of Atlas. They haue in the said mountaines a large iurisdiction, namely diuers castles euery where, and many most rich and flourishing cities, all which, they thinke, were giuen them in olde time by the vice-royes of the Marini: for so soone as they had woon that kingdome, the kindred of Husein affoorded them great aide and seruice. Their dominion is now subiect vnto the kings of Fez and of Segel∣mess. They haue a captaine, which for the most part resideth at the citie commonly called Garseluin. Likewise they are alwaies, in a manner, trauer∣sing of that desert which in their language is called <HI>Eddara.</HI> They are taken to be a most rich and honest people, being of abilitie to furnish for the warres about sixe thousande horsemen. Among these you shall often∣times finde many Arabians of another sort, whom they vse onely to be their seruants. The tribe of Abulhusein doe inhabite part of the foresaid desert of Eddara, howbeit a very smal part: the greatest number of whom are brought vnto such extreme miserie, that they haue not in those their wilde tents suf∣ficient sustenance to liue vpon. True it is, that they haue built them certaine habitations vpon the Libyan deserts; but yet they are cruelly pinched with famine and with extreme penurie of all things: and (that there might be no end of their miserie) they are constrained to pay yeerely tribute vnto their kindred and parents.</P>

In sommer time they vsually repaire vnto Tremizen, where they are thought for that season of the yeere to settle their aboad: their horsemen are to the number of fower thousand, all which are most noble warriours. The kindred of Hedeg possesse a certaine desert neere vnto Tremizen, called in their owne language Hangad. These haue no stipend from any prince, nor yet any iurisdiction at all, rapine and stealth is onely delightfull vnto them, they prouide onely for their familie and themselues, and are able to set foorth about fiue hundred horsemen. The tribe of Theleb inhabite the plaine of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Alger.</NOTE> Algezer: these haue often vagaries ouer the deserts vnto the prouince of Tedgear. Vnto them were subiect in times past the most famous cities of Algezer and Tedelles: howbeit in these our daies they were recouered againe from them by <HI>Barbarossa</HI> the Turke; which losse could not but greatly grieue and molest their king. It is repor∣ted moreouer, that at the same time, the principal of the said people of The∣leb were cut off.

And here one thing is to be noted by the way; to wit, that the two forenamed people called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Arabi∣ans called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> descended from Ismael the base sonne of Abra∣ham.</NOTE> Schachin and Hilel are originally Arabians of Arabia deserta, and thinke themselues to be descended from <HI>Ismael</HI> the sonne of <HI>Abraham.</HI> And those which wee called Machil, came first forth of Arabia foelix, and deriue their petigree from <HI>Saba.</HI> Before whom the Mahu∣metans preferre the former, which of <HI>Ismael</HI> are called Ismaelites.

The ancient Arabians, which were before the times of the Ismaelites, were called by the African historiographers Arabi-Araba, as if a man should say, Arabians of Arabia. But those which came of <HI>Ismael,</HI> they call Arabi Mus-Araba, as if they should say, Arabians ingraffed into the land of Arabia, or Arabians accidentally, because they were not originally bred &amp; borne in Arabia. And thē which afterward came into Africa, they name in their language Musteh∣geme, that is, barbarous Arabians; and that because they ioyned themselues vnto strangers, insomuch that not only their speech, but their manners also are most corrupt and barbarous.

<HEAD>The manners and customes of the African people, which inhabit the deserts of Libya.</HEAD>
<P>THose fiue kindes of people before rehearsed, to wit, the people<NOTE PLACE="marg">The people of Numidia.</NOTE> of Zenega, of Gansiga, of Terga, of Leuta, and of Bardeoa, are called of the Latins <HI>Numidae:</HI> and they liue all after one man∣ner, that is to say, without all lawe and ciuilitie. Their gar∣ment is a narrow and base peece of cloth, wherewith scarce halfe their bodie is couered. Some of them wrap their heads in a kinde of blacke cloth, as it were with a scarfe, such as the Turks vse, which is commonly called a Tur∣bant. Such as will be discerned from the common sort, for geutlemen, weare a iacket made of blew cotton with wide sleeues. And cotton-cloth is brought vnto them by certaine merchants from the land of Negros. They haue no beastes fit to ride vpon except their camels; vnto whom nature, betweene the bunch standing vpon the hinder part of their backes and their neckes, hath allotted a place, which may fitly serue to ride vpon, in stead of a saddle. Their manner of riding is most ridiculous. For sometimes they lay their legs acrosse vpon the camels neck; and sometimes againe (hauing no know∣ledge nor regard of stirrops) they rest their feete vpon a rope, which is cast ouer his shoulders. In stead of spurres they vse a truncheon of a cubites length, hauing at the one end thereof a goad, wherewith they pricke onely the shoulders of their camels. Those camels which they vse to ride vpon haue a hole bored through the gristles of their nose, in the which a ring of leather is fastened, whereby as with a bit, they are more easily curbed and mastred; after which manner I haue seene buffles vsed in Italie. For beds; they lie vpon mats made of sedge and bulrushes. Their tents are couered for the most part with course chamlet, or with a harsh kinde of wooll which commonly groweth vpon the boughes of their date-trees. As for their man∣ner<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wooll growing vpon the Palme tree.</NOTE> of liuing, it would seeme to any man incredible what hunger and scarci∣tie this nation will indure. Bread they haue none at all, neither vse they any seething or rosting; their foode is camels milke onely, and they desire no other dainties. For their breakefast they drinke off a great cup of camels milke: for supper they haue certaine dried flesh stieped in butter and milke; wherof each man taking his share, eateth it out of his fist. And that this their meate may not stay long vndigested in their stomackes, they sup off the foresaid broth wherein their flesh was steeped: for which purpose they vse the palmes of their hands as a most fit instrument framed by nature to the same end. After that, each one drinks his cup of milk, &amp; so their supper hath an ende. These Numidians, while they haue any store of milke, regard wa∣ter nothing at all, which for the most part happeneth in the spring of the yeere, all which time you shall finde some among them that will neither wash their hands nor their faces. Which seemeth not altogether to be vn∣likely; for (as we said before) while their milke lasteth, they frequent not
<PB N="21" REF="47"/>
those places where water is common: yea, and their camels, so long as they may feede vpon grasse, will drinke no water at all. They spende their whole daies in hunting and theeuing: for all their indeuour and exercise is to driue away the camels of their enemies; neither will they remaine aboue three daies in one place, by reason that they haue not pasture any longer for the sustenance of their camels. And albeit (as is aforesaid) they haue no ciuilitie at all, nor any lawes prescribed vnto them; yet haue they a certaine gouer∣nour or prince placed ouer them, vnto whom they render obedience and due honour, as vnto their king. They are not onely ignorant of all good learning and liberall sciences; but are likewise altogether careles and desti∣tute of vertue: insomuch that you shall finde scarce one amongst them all which is a man of iudgement or counsell. And if any iniuried partie will goe to the lawe with his aduersarie, he must ride continually fiue or sixe daies before he can come to the speech of any iudge. This nation hath all lear∣ning and good disciplines in such contempt, that they will not once vouch∣safe to goe out of their deserts for the studie and attaining thereof: neither, if any learned man shall chance to come among them, can they loue his companie and conuersation, in regarde of their most rude and detestable behauiour. Howbeit, if they can finde any iudge, which can frame himselfe to liue and continue among them, to him they giue most large yeerely al∣lowance. Some allow their iudge a thousand ducates yeerely, some more, and some lesse, according as themselues thinke good. They that will seeme to be accounted of the better sort, couer their heads (as I said before) with a peece of blacke cloth, part whereof, like a vizard or maske, reacheth downe ouer their faces, couering all their countenance except their eies; and this is their daily kinde of attire. And so often as they put meate into their mouthes they remooue the said maske, which being done, they foorth with couer their mouths again; alleging this fond reason: for (say they) as it is vn∣seemely for a man, after he hath receiued meate into his stomack, to vomite it out of his mouth againe and to cast it vpon the earth; euen so it is an vn∣decent part to eate meate with a mans mouth vncouered. The women of this nation be grosse, corpulent, and of a swart complexion. They are fattest vpon their brest and paps, but slender about the girdle-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Very ciuill they are, after their manner, both in speech and gestures: sometimes they will accept of a kisse; but whoso tempteth them farther, putteth his owne life in hazard. For by reason of iealousie you may see them daily one to be the death and destruction of another, and that in such sauage and brutish man∣ner, that in this case they will shew no compassion at all. And they seeme to be more wise in this behalfe then diuers of our people, for they will by no meanes match themselues vnto an harlot. The liberalitie of this people hath at all times beene exceeding great. And when any trauellers may passe through their drie and desert territories, they will neuer repaire vnto their tents, neither will they themselues trauell vpon the common high way. And if any carouan or multitude of merchants will passe those deserts, they are
<PB N="22" REF="48"/>
bound to pay certaine custome vnto the prince of the said people, namely, for euery camels load a peece of cloth woorth a ducate. Vpon a time I re∣member that trauelling in the companie of certaine merchants ouer the desert called by them Araoan, it was our chaunce there to meete with the prince of Zanaga; who, after he had receiued his due custome, inuited the said companie of merchants, for their recreation, to goe and abide with him in his tents fower or fiue daies. Howbeit, because his tents were too farre out of our way, and for that we should haue wandered farther then we thought good, esteeming it more conuenient for vs to hold on our direct course, we refused his gentle offer, and for his courtesie gaue him great thanks. But not being satisfied therewith, he commanded that our camels should proceede on forward, but the merchants he carried along with him, and gaue them very sumptuous entertainment at his place of aboad. Where wee were no sooner arriued, but this good prince caused camels of all kindes and ostri∣ches,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vsed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> victuals.</NOTE> which he had hunted and taken by the way, to bee killed for his hou∣shold prouision. Howbeit we requested him not to make such daily slaugh∣ters of his camels; affirming moreouer, that we neuer vsed to eate the flesh of a gelt camell, but when all other victuals failed vs. Whereunto hee an∣swered, that he should deale vnciuilly, if he welcommed so woorthie and so seldome-seene guests with the killing of small cattell onely. Wherefore he wished vs to fall to such prouision as was set before vs. Here might you haue seene great plentie of rosted and sodden flesh: their roasted ostriches were brought to the table in wicker platters, being seasoned with sundrie kindes of herbes and spices. Their bread made of Mill and panicke was of a most sa∣uorie and pleasant taste: and alwaies at the end of dinner or supper we had plentie of dates and great store of milke serued in. Yea, this bountifull and noble prince, that he might sufficiently shew how welcome we were vnto him, would together with his nobilitie alwaies beare vs companie: howbeit we euer dined and supped apart by our selues. Moreouer he caused certaine religious and most learned men to come vnto our banquet; who, all the time we remained with the said prince, vsed not to eate any bread at all, but fed onely vpon flesh and milke. Whereat we being somewhat amazed, the good prince gently told vs, that they all were borne in such places whereas no kinde of graine would grow: howbeit that himselfe, for the entertain∣ment of strangers, had great plentie of corne laid vp in store. Wherefore he bad vs to be of good cheere, saying that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would eate onely of such things as his owne natiue soile affoorded: affirming moreouer, that bread was yet in vse among them at their feast of passeouer, and at other feasts also, where∣upon they vsed to offer sacrifice. And thus we remained with him for the space of two daies; all which time, what woonderfull and magnificent cheere we had made vs, would seeme incredible to report. But the third day, being desirous to take our leaue, the prince accompanied vs to that place where we ouertooke our camels and companie sent before. And this I dare most deepely take mine oath on, that we spent the saide prince ten times

more, then our custome which he receiued came to. Wee thought it not amisse here to set downe this historie, to declare in some sort the courtesie and liberalitie of the said nation. Neither could the prince aforesaid vnder∣stand our language nor we his; but all our speech to and fro was made by an interpreter. And this which we haue here recorded as touching this nation, is likewise to be vnderstood of the other fower nations aboue mentioned, which are dispersed ouer the residue of the Numidian deserts.</P>

Howbeit they are farre more valiant then the said Africans; and vse commonly to exchange camels in the lande of Ne∣gros:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where the Bar∣barie horses are bred.</NOTE> they haue likewise great store of horses, which in Europe they cal hor∣ses of Barbarie. They take woonderfull delight in hunting and pursuing of deere, of wilde asses, of ostriches, and such like. Neither is it here to be omit∣ted, that the greater part of Arabians which inhabite Numidia, are very wittie and conceited in penning of verses; wherein each man will decipher<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arabian poems and verses.</NOTE> his loue, his hunting, his combates, and other his woorthie actes: and this is done for the most part in ryme, after the Italians manner. And albe it they are most liberally minded, yet dare they not by bountifull giuing make any shew of wealth; for they are daily oppressed with manifold inconueniences. They are apparelled after the Numidians fashion, sauing that their women differ somewhat from the women of Numidia. Those deserts which they doe now enioy were woont to be possessed by Africans: but rhe Arabians with their armie inuading that part of Africa, draue out the naturall Numi∣dians, and reserued the deserts adioining vpon The land of dates, vnto them∣selues: but the Numidians began to inhabite those deserts which border vpon the land of Negros. The Arabians which dwell betweene mount Atlas and the Mediterran sea are far wealthier then these which we now speake of, both for costlines of apparell, for good horse-meate, and for the statelines and beautie of their tents. Their horses also are of better shape and more corpulent, but not so swift as the horses of the Numidian desert. They exer∣cise husbandrie and haue great increase of corne. Their droues and flockes of cattell be innumerable, insomuch that they cannot inhabite one by ano∣ther for want of pasture. They are somewhat more vile and barbarous then those which inhabite the deserts, and yet they are not altogether destitute of liberalitie: part of them, which dwell in the territorie of Fez are subiect vnto the king of Fez. Those which remaine in Marocco and Duccala haue conti∣nued this long time free from all exaction and tribute: but so soone as the
<PB N="24" REF="49"/>
king of Portugall began to beare rule ouer Azafi and Azamor, there began also among them strife and ciuill warre. Wherefore being assailed by the king of Portugall on the one side, and by the king of Fez on the other, and being oppressed also with the extreme famine and scarcitie of that yeere, they were brought vnto such miserie, that they freely offered themselues as<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arabians offer themselues slaues to any that would re∣leeue their ex∣treme hunger.</NOTE> slaues vnto the Portugals, submitting themselues to any man, that was wil∣ling to releeue their intolerable hunger: and by this meanes scarce one of them was left in all Duccala. Moreouer those which possesse the deserts bordering vpon the kingdomes of Tremizen and Tunis may all of them, in regard of the rest, be called noblemen and gentlemen. For their gouernours receiuing euery yeere great reuenues from the king of Tunis, diuide the same afterward among their people, to the end they may auoid all discord: and by this meanes all dissension is eschewed, and peace is kept firme and in∣uiolable among them. They haue notable dexteritie and cunning, both in making of tents, and in bringing vp and keeping of horses. In summer time they vsually come neere vnto Tunis, to the end that each man may prouide himselfe of bread, armour, and other necessaries: all which they carrie with them into the deserts, remaining there the whole winter. In the spring of the yeere they applie themselues to hunting, insomuch that no beast can escape their pursuit. My selfe, I remember, was once at their tents, to my no little danger and inconuenience; where I sawe greater quantitie of cloth, brasse, yron, and copper, then a man shall oftentimes finde in the most rich ware∣houses of some cities. Howbeit no trust is to be giuen vnto them; for if oc∣casion serue, they will play the theeues most slyly and cunningly; notwith∣standing they seeme to carrie some shewe of ciuilitie. They take great de∣light in poetrie, and will pen most excellent verses, their language being very pure and elegant. If any woorthie poet be found among them, he is accepted by their gouernours with great honour and liberalitie; neither would any man easily beleeue what wit and decencie is in their verses. Their women (according to the guise of that countrie) goe very gorgeously atti∣red: they weare linnen gownes died black, with exceeding wide sleeues, ouer which sometimes they cast a mantle of the same colour or of blew, the cor∣ners of which mantle are very artificially fastened about their shoulders with a fine siluer claspe. Likewise they haue rings hanging at their eares, which for the most part are made of siluer: they weare many rings also vpon their fingers. Moreouer they vsually weare about their thighes and ankles certaine scarfes and rings, after the fashion of the Africans. They couer their faces with certaine maskes hauing onely two holes for their eies to peepe out at. If any man chance to meete with them, they presently hide their faces, passing by him with silence, except it be some of their allies or kinsfolks; for vnto them they alwaies discouer their faces, neither is there any vse of the said maske so long as they be in presence. These Arabians when they trauell any iourney (as they oftentimes doe) they set their women vpon certaine saddles made handsomely of wicker for the same purpose, and
<PB N="25" REF="49"/>
fastened to their camels backes, neither be they any thing too wide, but fit onely for a woman to sit in. When they goe to the warres each man carries his wife with him, to the end that she may cheere vp her good man, and giue him encouragement. Their damsels which are vnmarried doe vsually paint their faces, brests, armes, hands, and fingers with a kinde of counterfeit co∣lour: which is accounted a most decent custome among them. But this fashion was first brought in by those Arabians, which before we called Afri∣cans, what time they began first of all to inhabite that region; for before then, they neuer vsed any false or glozing colours. The women of Barbarie vse not this fond kind of painting, but contenting themselues only with their naturall hiew, they regarde not such fained ornaments: howbeit sometimes they will temper a certaine colour with hens-dung and safron, wherewithall they paint a little round spot on the bals of their cheeks, about the bredth of a French crowne. Likewise betweene their eie-browes they make a triangle; and paint vpon their chinnes a patch like vnto an oliue leafe. Some of them also doe paint their eie-browes: and this custome is very highly esteemed of by the Arabian poets and by the gentlemen of that countrie. Howbeit they will not vse these fantasticall ornaments aboue two or three daies toge∣ther: all which time they will not be seene to any of their friends, except it be to their husbands and children: for these paintings seeme to bee great allurements vnto lust, whereby the said women thinke themselues more trim and beautifull.</P>

<HEAD>How the Arabians in the deserts betweene Barbarie and Aegypt doe lead their liues.</HEAD>
<P>THE life of these men is full of miserie and calamitie: for the places where they inhabite are barren and vnpleasant. They haue some store of camels and other cattell: howbeit their fodder is so scarce, that they cannot well sustaine them. Neither shall you finde ouer all the whole re∣gion any place fit to beare corne. And if in that desert there be any villages at all, which vse to husband and manure their ground; yet reape they small commoditie thereby, except it be for plentifull increase of dates. Their ca∣mels and other of their cattell they exchange for dates and corne; and so the poore husbandmen of the foresaide villages haue some small recom∣pence for their labours: notwithstanding, how can all this satisfie the hun∣ger of such a multitude? For you shall dayly see in Sicilia great numbers of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arabians of Barca lay their sonnes to pawne vnto the Sicilians for corne.</NOTE> their sonnes layde to pawne. Because when they haue not wherewithall to pay for the corne which they there buy, they are constrained to leaue their sonnes behinde them, as pledges of future payment. But the Sicilians, if their money be not paide them at the time appointed, will chalenge the Arabians sonnes to be their slaues.

theeues in the whole world. If any stranger fall into their hands, depriuing him of all that he hath, they presently carrie him to Sicilie, and there either sell or exchange him for come. And I thinke, that no merchants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at any time within these hundred yeeres <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for traffiques sake vpon any part of their coast. For when they are to passe by with merchandize, or about any other weightie affaires, they eschew that region fiue hundred miles at the least. Once I remember, that I my selfe, for my better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and to auoide the danger of those mischieuous people, went in com∣panie with certaine merchants, who in three ships sayled along their coast. We were no sooner espied of them; but forthwith they came running to the shore, making signes that they would traffique with vs to our great ad∣uantage. Howbeit becaufe we durst not repose any trust in them, none of our companie would depart the ship, before they had deliuered certaine pledges vnto vs. Which being done, we bought certaine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or gel∣ded men, and good store of butter of them. And so immediately weighing our ankers we betooke vs to flight, fearing least we should haue beene met withall by the Sicilian and Rhodian Pirates, and beene spoiled not onely of our goods, but of our liberties also. To be short, the saide Arabians are verie rude, forlorne, beggerly, leane, and hunger-starued people, hauing God (no doubt) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> displeased against them, by whose vengeance they dayly sustaine such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> calamities.</P>

<HEAD>Of the faith and religion of the ancient Africans or Moores.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancient Africans were much addicted to idolatrie, euen as certain of the Persians are at this day, some of whom worship the sunne, and others the fire, for their gods. For the saide Africans had in times past magnificent and most stately temples built and dedicated, as well to the honour of the sunne as of the fire. In these temples day and night they kept fire kind∣led, giuing diligent heed that it might not at any time be extinguished, euen as we read of the Romane Vestall virgines: All which you may read more fully and at large in the Persian and African Chronicles. Those Africans which inhabited Libya and Numidia, would each of them worship some certaine planet, vnto whom likewise they offered sacrifices and praiers. Some others of the land of Negros worship <HI>Guighimo,</HI> that is to say, <HI>The Lord of Heauen.</HI> And this sound point of religion was not deliuered vnto them by any Prophet or teacher, but was inspired, as it were, from God him∣selfe. After that, they embraced the Iewish law, wherein they are said to haue continued many yeeres. Afterward they professed the Christian religion, and continued Christians, vntill such time as the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> superstition preuailed; which came to passe in the yeere of the Hegeira 208. About which time certaine of <HI>Mahomets</HI> disciples so bewitched them with elo∣quent and deceiueable speeches, that they allured their weake minds to con∣sent vnto their opinion; insomuch that all the kingdomes of the Negros adioyning vnto Libya receiued the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> lawe. Neither is there any region in all the Negros land, which hath in it at this day any Christians at all. At the same time such as were found to be Iewes, Christians, or of the African religion, were slaine euerie man of them. Howbeit those which dwell neere vnto the Ocean sea, are all of them verie grosse idolaters. Be∣tweene whom and the Portugals there hath beene from time to time and euen at this present is, great traffique and familiaritie. The inhabitants of Barbarie continued for many yeeres idolaters; but before the comming of <HI>Mahomet</HI> aboue 250, yeeres, they are saide to haue embraced the Chri∣stian faith: which some thinke came to passe vpon this occasion; namely, because that of part Barbarie which containeth the kingdome of Tripolis and Tunis, was in times past gouerned by <HI>Apulian</HI> &amp; <HI>Sicilian</HI> Captaines, and the countries of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Trenizen.</NOTE> Caesaria and of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Maroco and <UNCLEAR>Fez</UNCLEAR>.</NOTE> Mauritania are supposed to haue beene

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vnto the Gothes. At what time also many Christians fleeing from the furie and madnes of the Gothes left their sweet natiue soyle of Italy, and at length arriued in Africa neere vnto Tunis: where hauing setled their aboad for some certaine space, they began at length to haue the dominion ouer all that region. Howbeit the Christians which inhabited Barbaria, not respecting the rites and ceremonies of the Church of Rome, followed the Arrians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and forme of liuing: and one of the African Christians was that most godly and learned father Saint <HI>Augustine.</HI> When the Ara∣bians therefore came to conquer that part of Africa they found Christians to be Lords ouer the regions adiacent; of whom, after sundry hot conflicts, the saide Arabians got the victorie. Whereupon the Arrians being depri∣ued of all their dominions and goods went part of them into Italy and part into Spaine. And so about two hundred yeeres after the death of <HI>Mahu∣met,</HI> almost all Barbarie was infected with his law. Howbeit afterward, ciuile dissensions arising among them, neglecting the law of <HI>Mahumet,</HI> they slue all the priests and gouernours of that region. Which tumult when it came to the eares of the Mahumetan Caliphas, they sent an huge armie against the saide rebels of Barbarie, to wit, those which were reuolted from the Ca∣lipha of Bagdet, and seuerely punished their misdemeanor. And euen at the same time was layd the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> foundation of the Mahumetan law; notwithstanding there haue remained many heresies among them euen vntill this verie day.

<HEAD>Of the letters and characters of the Africans.</HEAD>
<P>THose writers which record the histories of the Arabians doings are all iointly of opinion, that the Africans were woont to vse onely the Latine letters. And they doe most constantly affirme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Africans vsed in times past none other kind of letters but the Roman letters.</NOTE> that the Arabians, when they first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Africa and especially Barbarie (which was the principall seate of the Africans) founde no letters nor characters there, beside the Latine. Neither indeede doe they denie that the Africans haue a peculiar kinde of language, but this they firmly auouch, that they haue the very same letters which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Florentinesa people of Italie haue. The Arabians haue no historie <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Perhaps he meaneth the histories of Sa∣lust, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Li∣uius, and others.</NOTE> of African matters, which was not first written in Latine. They haue certaine ancient authors, who writ partly in the times of the Arrians and partly before their times, the names of all which are cleane forgotten. Howbeit it is very likely that those Latine authors haue written many volumes: for when their interpreters laboured to perswade something vnto vs, I remember they would say, it is contained in the seuentieth booke. Neither did they in translating of the
<PB N="29" REF="51"/>
said volumes altogether follow the authors order; but taking the historie of some one prince, they would conioine his time and actions with the histo∣rie of the Persian, Assyrian, and Chaldaean kings, or of the Israelites, which concerned the same times. But when as those which rebelled against the Calipha of Bagdet (as is aforesaid) got the vpper hand in Africa, they burnt all the Africans bookes. For they were of opinion, that the Africans, so long as they had any knowledge of naturall philosophie or of other good artes and sciences, would euery day more and more arrogantly contemne the lawe of Mahumet. Contrariwise, some historiographers there are which affirme, that the Africans had a kinde of letters peculiar vnto them∣selues; which notwithstanding, from the time wherein the Italians began first to inhabite Barbarie, and wherein the Christians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of Italie from the Gothes, began to subdue those prouinces of Africa, were vtterly abolished and taken away. For it is likely that a people vanquished shoulde follow the customes and the letters also of their conquerors. And did not the same thing happen to the Persians, while the Arabians empire stood? For certaine it is, that the Persians at the same time lost those letters which were peculiar vnto their nation; and that all their bookes, by the comman∣dement<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mahume∣tan Calisas caused all the bookes of the Persians to be burned.</NOTE> of the Mahumetan prelates, were burnt, least their knowledge in naturall philosophie, or their idolatrous religion might mooue them to contemne the precepts of Mahumet. The like also (as we shewed before) befell the Barbarians when as the Italians and the Gothes vsurped their dominions in Barbarie; which may here (I hope) suffice the gentle reader. Howbeit this is out of doubt, that all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-cities and inland-cities of Bar∣barie doe vse Latine letters onely, whensoeuer they will commit any epi∣taphes or any other verses or prose vnto posteritie. The consideration of all which former particulars hath made me to be of opinion, that the Africans in times past had their owne proper and peculiar letters, wherein they de∣scribed their doings and exploites. For it is likely that the Romans, when they first subdued those prouinces (as conquerours vsually doe) vtterly spoi∣led and tooke away all their letters and memorie, and established their owne letters in the stead thereof; to the end that the fame and honour of the Ro∣man people might there onely be continued. And who knoweth not that the very same attempt was practised by the Goths vpon the stately buildings of the Romans, and by the Arabians against the monuments of the Persi∣ans. The very same thing likewise we daily see put in practise by the Turks, who when they haue gotten any citie or towne from the Christians, doe presently cast foorth of the temples all the images and memorials of their saints. And to omit all the aforesaid, may we not in our time see the like daily practised in Rome; where sumptuous and stately buildings left vnperfect by reason of the vntimely death of one Pope, are for some noueltie vtterly ruined and destroied by his next successour? Or else, doth not the new Pope cause his predecessours armes to be razed, and his owne in stead thereof to be set vp? Or at the least, if he will not seeme so arrogant, letting his prede∣cessours
<PB N="30" REF="52"/>
monuments stand still, doth he not erect others for himselfe farre more sumptuous and stately? No maruell therefore, though so long suc∣cesse of times and so many alterations haue quite bereaued the Africans of their letters. Concerning those nine hundred yeeres wherein the Africans vsed the letters of the Arabians, <HI>Ibnu Rachich,</HI> a most diligent writer of A∣frica, doth in his Chronicle most largely dispute; whether the Africans euer had any peculiar kinde of writing or no. And at last he concludeth the affir∣matiue part; that they had: for (saith he) whosoeuer denieth this, may as well denie, that they had a language peculiar vnto themselues. For it cannot be that any people should haue a proper kinde of speech, and yet should vse letters borrowed from other nations, and being altogether vnfit for their mother-language.</P>

<HEAD>Of the situation of Africa.</HEAD>
<P>AS there are fower partes in Africa, so the situation thereof is not in all places alike. That part which lieth towards the Me∣diterran sea, that is to say, from the streites of Gibraltar to the frontiers of Aegypt, is here and there full of moun∣taines: Southward it is extended about a hundred miles, al∣beit in some places it be larger and in some other narrower. From the saide mountaines vnto mount Atlas there is a very spatious plaine &amp; many little hillocks. Fountaines there are in this region great store, which meeting together at one head doe send foorth most beautifull riuers and christall streames. Betweene the foresaid mountaines and the plaine countrie is situ∣ate the mountaine of Atlas; which beginning westward vpon the Ocean sea, stretcheth it selfe towards the east as farre as the borders of Aegypt. Ouer against Atlas lieth that region of Numidia which beareth dates, being eue∣ry where almost sandie ground. Betweene Numidia and the land of Negros is the sandie desert of Libya situate, which containeth many mountaines also; howbeit merchants trauell not that way, when as they may goe other waies with more ease and lesse danger. Beyond the Libyan desert beginneth the land of Negros, all places whereof are barren and sandie except those which adioine vpon the riuer of Niger, or through the which any riuer or streame runneth.</P>

<P>ALl the region of Barbarie, and the mountaines contained therein, are subiect more to cold then to heat. For seldome commeth any gale of winde which bringeth not some snow therwith. In al the said mountaines there grow abundance of fruits, but not so great plentie of corne. The inhabitants of these mountaines liue for the greatest part of the yeere vpon barlie bread.
<PB N="31" REF="52"/>
The springs &amp; riuers issuing foorth of the said mountaines, representing the qualitie and taste of their natiue soile, are somewhat muddie and impure, especially vpon the confines of Mauritania. These mountaines likewise are replenished with woods and loftie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and are greatly stored with beastes of all kindes. But the little hils and vallies lying betweene the foresaid moun∣taines and mount Atlas are far more commodious, and abounding with corne. For' they are moistened with riuers springing out of Atlas, and from thence holding on their course to the Mediterran sea. And albeit woods are somewhat more scarce vpon these plaines, yet are they much more fruitfull, then be the plaine countries situate betweene Atlas and the Ocean sea, as namely the regions of Maroco, of Duccala, of Tedles, of Temesna, of Az∣gara, and the countrie lying towards the straites of Gibraltar. The moun∣taines<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mountaines of Atlas excee∣ding cold.</NOTE> of Atlas are exceeding colde and barren, and bring foorth but small store of corne, beeing woody on all sides, and engendring almost all the riuers of Africa. The fountaines of Atlas are euen in the midst of summer extremely cold; so that if a man dippeth his hand therein for any long space, he is in great danger of loosing the same. Howbeit the said mountaines are not so cold in all places: for some partes thereof are of such milde tempera∣ture, that they may be right commodiously inhabited: yea and sundry pla∣ces thereof are well stored with inhabitants; as in the second part of this present discourse we will declare more at large. Those places which are de∣stitute of inhabitants be either extremely cold, as namely the same which lie ouer against Mauritania: or very rough and vnpleasant, to wit, those which are directly opposite to the region of Temesna. Where notwithstanding in summer time they may feede their great and small cattell, but not in winter by any meanes. For then the North winde so furiously rageth, bringing with it such abundance of snowe; that all the cattell which till then remaine vpon the saide mountaines, and a great part of the people also are forced to lose their liues in regard thereof: wherefore whosoeuer hath any occasion to trauell that way in winter time, chuseth rather to take his iourney betweene Mauritania and Numidia. Those merchants which bring dates out of Nu∣midia for the vse and seruice of other nations, set foorth vsually vpon their iourney about the ende of October; and yet they are oftentimes so oppres∣sed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Most woonder∣full and terrible snowes.</NOTE> and ouertaken with a sudden fall of snowe, that scarcely one man among them all escapeth the danger of the tempest. For when it beginneth to snow ouer night, before the next morning not onely carts and men, but euen the verie trees are so drowned &amp; ouerwhelmed therein, that it is not possible to finde any mention of them. Howbeit the dead carcases are then founde when the sunne hath melted the snow. I my selfe also, by the goodnes of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The extreme danger of snow which Iohn Leo himselfe escaped</NOTE> almighty God, twise escaped the most dreadfull danger of the foresaid snow; whereof, if it may not be tedious to the reader, I will heere in few wordes make relation.

kinde of hayle. Here we found eleuen or twelue horsemen (Arabians to our thinking) who perswading vs to leaue our carts and to goe with them, pro∣mised vs a good and secure place to lodge in. For mine owne part, that I might not seeme altogether vnciuill, I thought it not meete to refuse their good offer; albeit I stood in doubt least they went about to practise some mischiefe. Wherefore I bethought my selfe to hide vp a certaine summe of gold which I had as then about me. But all being ready to ride, I had no lei∣sure to hide away my coine from them; whereupon I fained that I would goe ease my selfe. And so departing a while their companie, and getting me vnder a certaine tree, whereof I tooke diligent notice, I buried my money betweene certaine stones and the roote of the said tree. And then we rode on quietly till about midnight. What time one of them thinking that he had staied long ynough for his pray, began to vtter that in words which se∣cretly he had conceiued in his minde. For he asked whether I had any mo∣ney about me or no? To whom I answered, that I had left my money behind with one of them which attended the cartes, and that I had then none at all about me. Howbeit they being no whit satisfied with this answer, comman∣ded me, for all the cold weather, to strip my selfe out of mine apparell. At length when they could find no money at all, they said in iesting &amp; scoffing wise, that they did this for no other purpose, but onely to see how strong and hardie I was, and how I could endure the cold and tempestuous season. Well, on we rode, seeking our way as well as we could that darke and dismall night; and anone we heard the bleating of sheepe, coniecturing thereby, that we were not farre distant from some habitation of people. Wherefore out of hand we directed our course thitherwards: being constrained to leade our horses through thicke woods and ouer steepe and craggie rocks, to the great hazard and perill of our liues. And at length after many labours, wee found shepherds in a certaine caue: who, hauing with much paines brought their cattell in there, had kindled a lustie fire for themselues, which they were constrained, by reason of the extreme cold, daily to sit by. Who vnderstan∣ding our companie to be Arabians, feared at the first that we would do them some mischiefe: but afterward being perswaded that we were driuen thither by extremitie of cold, and being more secure of vs, they gaue vs most friend∣ly entertainment. For they set bread, flesh, and cheese before vs, wherewith hauing ended our suppers, we laid vs along each man to sleepe before the fire. All of vs were as yet exceeding cold, but especially my selfe, who before with great horrour and trembling was stripped starke naked. And so we con∣tinued with the said shepherds for the space of two daies: all which time we could not set foorth, by reason of continuall snowe. But the thirde day, so soone as they saw it leaue snowing, with great labour they began to remooue that snowe which lay before the doore of their caue. Which done, they brought vs to our horses, which we found well prouided of hay in another caue. Being all mounted, the shepherds accompanied vs some part of our way, shewing vs where the snowe was of least depth, and yet euen there it
<PB N="33" REF="53"/>
touched our horse bellies. This day was so cleere, that the sunne tooke away all the cold of the two daies going before. At length entring into a certaine village neere vnto Fez, we vnderstood, that our cartes which passed by, were ouerwhelmed with the snowe. Then the Arabians seeing no hope of recom∣pence for all the paines they had taken (for they had defended our carts from theeues) carried a certaine Iew of our companie with them as their captiue, (who had lost a great quantitie of dates, by reason of the snowe aforesaid) to the end that he might remaine as their prisoner, till he had satisfied for all the residue. From my selfe they tooke my horse, and committed mee vnto the wide world and to fortune. From whence, riding vpon a mule, within three daies I arriued at Fez, where I heard dolefull newes of our merchants and wares, that they were cast away in the snowe. Yea, they thought that I had beene destrosed with the rest; but it seemed that God would haue it otherwise. Now, hauing finished the historie of mine owne misfortunes, let vs returne vnto that discourse where we left. Beyond Atlas there are certaine hot &amp; dry places moistened with very few riuers, but those which flow out of Atlas it selfe: some of which riuers running into the Libyan deserts are dried vp with the sands, but others do ingender lakes. Neither shal you finde in these countries any places apt to bring forth corne, notwithstanding they haue dates in abundance. There are also certaine other trees bearing fruit, but in so small quantitie, that no increase nor gaine is to be reaped by them. You may see likewise in those partes of Numidia which border vpon Libya certaine barren hils destitute of trees, vpon the lower parts whereof growe nothing but vnprofitable thornes and shrubs. Amongst these mountaines you shall finde no riuers nor springs, nor yet any waters at all, except it be in certaine pits and wels almost vnknowen vnto the inhabitants of that re∣gion. Moreouer in sixe or seuen daies iourney they haue not one drop of water, but such as is brought vnto them by certaine merchants vpon camels backes. And that especially in those places which lye vpon the maine road from Fez to Tombuto, or from Tremizen to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Agadez.</NOTE> Agad. That iourney likewise is verie dangerous which is of late found out by the merchants of our daies from Fez to Alcair ouer the deserts of Libya, were it not for an huge lake in the way, vpon the bankes whereof the Sinites and the Goranites doe in∣habite. But in the way which leadeth from Fez to Tombuto are certaine pits enuironed either with the hides or bones of camels. Neither doe the merchants in sommer time passe that way without great danger of their liues: for oftentimes it falleth out, when the south winde bloweth, that all those pits are stopped vp with sande. And so the merchants, when they can finde neither those pits, nor any mention thereof, must needes perish for extreame thirst: whose carcases are afterward found lying scattered here and there, and scorched with the heat of the sunne. One remedie they haue<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange re∣medie vsed by the African merchants to quench their thirst.</NOTE> in this case, which is verie strange: for when they are so grieuously oppres∣sed with thirst, they kill foorthwith some one of their camels, out of whose bowels they wring and expresse some quantitie of water, which water they
<PB N="34" REF="54"/>
they drinke and carrie about with them, till they haue either found some pit of water, or till they pine away for thirst. In the desert which they cal Azaoad there are as yet extant two monuments built of marble, vpon which marble is an Epitaphe engrauen, signifying that one of the said monuments repre∣sented a most rich merchant, and the other a carrier or transporter of wares. Which wealthie merchant bought of the carrier a cup of water for tenne<NOTE PLACE="marg">A merchant constrained by extreme thirst, gaue ten thou∣sand duckats for a cup of water.</NOTE> thousand ducates, and yet this pretious water could suffice neither of them; for both were consumed with thirst. This desert likewise containeth sundry kinds of beasts, which in the fourth part of this discourse concerning Libya, and in our treatise of the beasts of Africa, we will discourse of more at large. I was determined to haue written more cōcerning those things which hap∣pened vnto my self &amp; the rest of my company trauelling through the Liby∣an deserts vnto Gualata. For somtime being sore a thirst, we could not find one drop of water, partly because our guide strayed out of the direct course, and partly because our enemies had cut off the springs and chanels of the foresaid pits and wels. Insomuch that the small quantitie of water which we found, was sparingly to be kept; for that which would scarce suffice vs for fiue daies, we were constrained to keepe for ten. But if I should commit to writing all things woorthy of memorie, a whole yeare were not sufficient for me. The lande of Negros is extreme hot, hauing some store of moy∣sture also, by reason of the riuer of Niger running through the midst there∣of. All places adioining vpon Niger doe mightily abound both with cattle &amp; corne. No trees I saw there but only certain great ones, bearing a kind of bitter fruit like vnto a chestnut, which in their language is called Goron.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fruit called Goron. Cocos. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Onions.</NOTE> Likewise in the same regions grow Cocos, cucumbers, onions, and such kinde of herbes and fruits in great abundance. There are no mountaines at all either in Libya or in the land of Negros: howbeit diuers fennes and lakes there are; which (as men report) the inundation of Niger hath left behinde it. Neither are the woods of the said regions altogether destitute of Ele∣phants and other strange beastes; whereof we will make relation in their due place.</P>

<HEAD>What naturall impressions and motions the aire of Africa is subiect vnto; and what effects ensue thereupon.</HEAD>
<P>THroughout the greatest part of Barbarie stormie and cold wea∣ther begin commonly about the midst of October. But in De∣cember and Ianuarie the cold groweth somewhat more sharpe in all places: howbeit this happeneth in the morning onely, but so gently and remissely, that no man careth greatly to warme himselfe by the fire. Februarie somewhat mitigateth the cold of winter, but that so in∣constantly, that the weather changeth sometime fiue and sometime sixe times in one day. In March the north and west windes vsually blowe, which cause the trees to be adorned with blossoms. In Aprill all fruits attaine to
<PB N="35" REF="54"/>
their proper forme and shape, insomuch that cherries are commonly ripe about the end of Aprill and the beginning of May<SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>n the midst of May they gather their figs: and in mid-Iune their grapes are ripe in many places. Like∣wise their peares, their sweete quinces and their damascens attaine vnto suffi∣cient ripenes in the moneths of Iune and Iulie. Their figs of Autumne may be gathered in August; howbeit they neuer haue so great plentie of figs and peaches, as in September. By the midst of August they vsually begin to drie their grapes in the sun, where of they make reisins. Which if they cannot fi∣nish in September, by reason of vnseasonable weather, of their grapes as then vngathered they vse to make wine and must, especially in the prouince of Rifa, as we will in due place signifie more at large. In the midst of Octo∣ber they take in their honie, and gather their pomegranates and quinces. In<NOTE PLACE="marg">The oliues of Africa.</NOTE> Nouember they gather their oliues, not climing vp with ladders nor pluc∣king them with their hands, according to the custome of Europe; for the trees of Mauritania and Caesarea are so tal, that no ladder is long ynongh to reach vnto the fruit. And therefore their oliues being full ripe, they clime the trees, beating them off the boughes with certaine long poles, albeit they know this kinde of beating to be most hurtfull vnto the saide trees. Some∣times they haue great plentie of oliues in Africa, and sometimes as great scarcitie. Certaine great oliue-trees there are, the oliues whereof are eaten ripe by the inhabitants, because they are not so fit for oile. No yeere falles out to be so vnseasonable, but that they haue three monethes in the spring alwaies temperate. They begin their spring vpon the fifteenth day of Fe∣bruarie, accounting the eighteenth of May for the ende thereof: all which time they haue most pleasant weather. But if from the fiue and twentith of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Raine signify∣ing plentie or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> Aprill, to the fifth of May they haue no raine fall, they take it as a signe of ill lucke. And the raine-water which falleth all the time aforesaid they call Nai∣san, that is, water blessed of God. Some store it vp in vessels, most religiously keeping it, as an holy thing. Their summer lasteth till the sixteenth of Au∣gust; all which time they haue most hot and cleere weather. Except perhaps some showers of raine fall in Iuly and August, which doe so infect the aire, that great plague and most pestilent feuers ensue thereupon; with which plague whosoeuer is infected, most hardly escapeth death. Their Au∣tumne they reckon from the 17. of August to the 16. of Nouember; ha∣uing commonly in the moneths of August and September not such ex∣treme heate as before. Howbeit all the time betweene the 15. of August and the 15. of September is called by them the furnace of the whole yeere, for that it bringeth figs, quinces, and such kinde of fruits to their full maturitie. From the 15. of Nouember they begin their winter-season, continuing the same till the 14. day of Februarie. So soone as winter commeth, they begin to till their ground which lieth in the plaines: but vpon the mountaines they goe to plough in October. The Africans are most certainly perswaded that euery yeere containeth fortie extreme hot daies, beginning vpon the 12. of Iune; and againe so many daies extreme colde, beginning from the
<PB N="36" REF="55"/>
12. of December. Their <HI>Aequinoctia</HI> are vpon the 16. of March, and the 16. of September. For their <HI>Solstitia</HI> they account the 16. of Iune and the 16. of December. These rules they doe most strictly obserue, as well in hus∣bandrie and nauigation, as in searching out the houses and true places of the planets: and these instructions, with other such like they teach their yoong children first of all. Many countrie-people and husbandmen there be in A∣frica,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pesants and vnlearned peo∣ple of Africa cunning in Astrologie.</NOTE> who knowing (as they say) neuer a letter of the booke, will notwithstan∣ding most learnedly dispute of Astrologie, &amp; alleage most profoūd reasons &amp; arguments for themselues. But whatsoeuer skill they haue in the art of A∣strologie, they first learned the same of the Latines: yea they giue those very names vnto their moneths which the Latines do. Moreouer they haue extāt among them a certaine great booke diuided into three volumes, which they call The treasurie or storehouse of husbandrie. This booke was then transla∣ted out of Latine into their toong, when <HI>Mansor</HI> was Lord of Granada. In the said Treasurie are all things contained which may seeme in any wise to concerne husbandrie; as namely, the changes and varietie of times, the ma∣ner of sowing, with a number of such like particulars, which (I thinke) at this day the Latine toong it selfe, whereout these things were first translated, doth not containe. Whatsoeuer either the Africans or the Mahumetans haue, which seemeth to appertaine in any wise to their law or religion, they make their computation thereof altogether according to the course of the moone. Their yeere is diuided into 354. daies: for vnto sixe moneths they<NOTE PLACE="marg">The yeere of the Arabians and Africans.</NOTE> allot 30. daies, and vnto the other sixe but 29; all which being added into one summe doe produce the number aforesaid: wherefore their yeere diffe∣reth eleuen daies from the yeere of the Latines. They haue at diuers times festiuall daies, and fasts. About the ende of Autumne, for all winter, and a great part of the spring they are troubled with boisterous windes, with haile, with terrible thunder and lightening: yea then it snoweth much in some places of Barbarie. The easterne, southerne, and southeasterne windes blow∣ing in May and Iune, doe very much hurt there: for they spoile the corne, and hinder the fruit from comming to ripenes. Their corne likewise is great∣ly appaired by snow, especially such as falleth in the day-time, when it be∣ginneth to flower. Vpon the mountaines of Atlas they diuide the yeere into<NOTE PLACE="marg">The yeere diui∣ded into two seasons onély, vpon the moun∣ain es of Atlas.</NOTE> two parts onely: for their winter continueth from October to Aprill; and from Aprill to October they account it summer: neither is there any day throughout the whole yeere, wherein the tops of those mountaines are not couered with snowe. In Numidia the yeere runneth away very swiftly: for they reape their corne in May, and in October they gather their dates: but from the midst of September they haue winter till the beginning of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. But if September falleth out to be rainie, they are like to lose most part of their dates. All the fields of Numidia require watering from the riuers; but if the mountaines of Atlas haue no raine fall vpon them, the Numidian riuers waxe drie, and so the fields are destitute of watering. October being destitute of raine, the husbandman hath no hope to cast his seede into the
<PB N="37" REF="55"/>
ground; and he despaireth likewise, if it raine not in Aprill. But their dates prosper more without raine, wherof the Numidians haue greater plentie then of corne. For albeit they haue some store of corne, yet can it scarcely suffice them for halfe the yeere. Howbeit, if they haue good increase of dates, they cannot want abundance of corne, which is sold vnto them by the Arabians for dates. If in the Libyan deserts there fall out change of weather about the midst of October; &amp; if it continue raining there all December, Ia∣nuarie, and some part of Februarie, it is wonderful what abundance of grasse and milke it bringeth foorth. Then may you finde diuers lakes in all places and many fennes throughout Libya; wherefore this is the meetest time for the Barbarie-merchants to trauell to the land of Negros. Here all kinde of fruits grow sooner ripe, if they haue moderate showers about the ende of Iuly. Moreouer the land of Negros receiueth by raine neither any benefite, nor yet any dammage at all. For the riuer Niger together with the water which falleth from certaine mountaines doth so moisten their grounds, that no places can be deuised to be more fruitfull: for that which Nilus is to Ae∣gypt, the same is Niger to the land of Negors: for it increaseth like Nilus<NOTE PLACE="marg">The increase of the riuers of Niger &amp; Nilu.</NOTE> from the fifteenth of Iune the space of fortie daies after, and for so many againe it decreaseth. And so at the increase of Niger, when all places are ouerflowen with water, a man may in a barke passe ouer all the land of Ne∣gros, albeit not without great perill of drowning; as in the fift part of this treatise we will declare more at large.</P>

<HEAD>Of the length and shortnes of the Africans liues.</HEAD>
<P>ALl the people of Barbarie by vs before mentioned liue vnto 65. or 70. yeeres of age, and fewe or none exceed that num∣ber. Howbeit in the foresaide mountaines I sawe some which had liued an hundred yeeres, and others which affir∣med themselues to be older; whose age was most healthfull and lustie. Yea some you shall finde here of fowerscore yeeres of age, who are sufficiently strong and able to exercise husbandrie, to dresse vines, and to serue in the warres; insomuch that yoong men are oftentimes inferiour vnto them. In Numidia, that is to say, in the land of dates, they liue a long time: howbeit they lose their teeth very soone, and their eies waxe woon∣derfully dimme. Which infirmities are likely to be incident vnto them, first because they continually feede vpon dates, the sweetnes and naturall qualitie whereof doth by little and little pull out their teeth: and secondly the dust and sand, which is tossed vp and downe the aire with easterne windes entring into their eies, doth at last miserably weaken and spoile their eie-sight. The inhabitants of Libya are of a shorter life; but those which are most strong and healthfull among them liue oftentimes till they come to threescore yeeres; albeit they are slender and leane of bodie. The Negros commonly
<PB N="38" REF="56"/>
liue the shortest time of al the rest: howbeit they are alwaies strong &amp; lustie, hauing their teeth sound euen till their dying day: yet is there no nation vn∣der heauen more prone to venerie; vnto which vice also the Libyans and Numidians are to too much addicted.

<HEAD>What kindes of diseases the Africans are subiect vnto.</HEAD>
<P>THE children, and sometimes the ancient women of this region are subiect vnto baldnes or vnnaturall shedding of haire; which disease they can hardly be cured of. They are likewise oftentimes troubled with the head-ache, which vsually afflicteth them without any ague ioined therewith. Many of them are tormented with the tooth-ache, which (as some thinke) they are the more subiect vnto, because immediately after hot pot∣tage they drinke cold water. They are oftentimes vexed with extreme paine of the stomacke, which ignorantly they call, the paine of the hart. They are likewise daily molested with inwarde gripings and infirmities ouer their whole body, which is thought to proceede of continuall drinking of water. Yea they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> subiect vnto bone-aches and goutes, by reason that they sit commonly vpon the bare ground, and neuer weare any shooes vpon their feete. Their chiefe gentlemen and noblemen prooue gowtie often∣times with immoderate drinking of wine and eating of daintie meats. Some with eating of oliues, nuts, and such course fare, are for the most part infec∣ted with the scuruies. Those which are of a sanguine complexion are greatly troubled with the cough, because that in the spring-season they sit too much vpon the ground. And vpon fridaies I had no small sport and recreation to goe and see them. For vpon this day the people flocke to church in great numbers to heare their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sermons. Now if any one in the ser∣mon-tile falles a neezing, all the whole multitude will neeze with him for companie, and so they make such a noise, that they neuer leaue, till the ser∣mon be quite done; so that a man shall reape but little knowledge by any of their sermons. If any of Barbarie be infected with the disease commonly called the French poxe; they die thereof for the most part, and are seldome cured. This disease beginneth with a kinde of anguish and swelling, and at<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French disease.</NOTE> length breaketh out into sores. Ouer the mountaines of Atlas, and through∣out all Numidia and Libya they scarcely know this disease. Insomuch that oftentimes the parties infected trauell foorthwith into Numidia or the land of Negros, in which places the aire is so temperate, that onely by remaining there they recouer their perfect health, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> home sound into their owne countrie: which I sawe many doe with mine owne eies; who without the helpe of any phisitian or medicine, except the foresaide holesome aire, were restored to their former health. Not so much as the name of this ma∣ladie was euer knowen vnto the Africans, before <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the king of

Howbeit, this they were most certainly perswaded of, that the same disease came first from Spaine; wherefore they (for want of a better name) do call it, The Spanish poxe. Notwithstanding at Tunis and ouer all Italie it is called the French disease. It is so called likewise in Aegypt and Syria: for there it is vsed as a common prouerbe of cursing; The French poxe take you. Amongst the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hernia or the disease called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or the rupture.</NOTE> Barbarians the disease called in Latine <HI>Hernia</HI> is not so common; but in Aegypt the people are much troubled therewith. For some of the Aegyp∣tians haue their cods oftentimes so swollen, as it is incredible to report. Which infirmitie is thought to be so common among them, because they eate so much gumme, and salt cheese. Some of their children are subiect vnto the falling sicknes; but when they growe to any stature, they are free from that disease. This falling sicknes likewise possesseth the women of Bar∣barie, and of the land of Negros; who, to excuse it, say that they are taken with a spirite. In Barbarie the plague is rife euery tenth, fifteenth, or twentith yeere, whereby great numbers of people are consumed; for they haue no cure for the same, but onely to rub the plague-sore with certaine ointments made of Armenian earth. In Numidia they are infected with the plague<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> scarce once in an hundred yeeres.

<HEAD>The commendable actions and vertues of the Africans.</HEAD>
<P>THose Arabians which inhabite in Barbarie or vpon the coast of the Mediterran sea, are greatly addicted vnto the studie of good artes and sciences: and those things which concerne their law and religion are esteemed by them in the first place. Moreouer they haue beene heretofore most studious of the Mathematiques, of Philosophie, and of Astrologie: but these artes (as it is aforesaid) were fower hundred yeeres agoe, vtterly destroyed and taken away by the chiefe professours of their lawe. The inhabitants of cities doe most religiously obserue and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those things which appertaine vnto their religion: yea they honour those doctours and priests, of whom they learne their law, as if they were petie-gods. Their Churches they frequent verie diligently, to the ende they may repeat certaine prescript and formal pray∣ers; most superstitiously perswading themselues that the same day wherein they make their praiers, it is not lawfull for them to wash certaine of their members, when as at other times they wil wash their whole bodies. Where∣of we will (by Gods helpe) discourse more at large in the second Booke of this present treatise, when we shall fall into the mentioning of <HI>Mahumet</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="57"/>
and of his religion. Moreouer those which inhabite Barbarie are of great cunning &amp; dexteritie for building &amp; for mathematicall inuentions, which a man may easily coniecture by their artificiall workes. Most honest peo∣ple they are, and destitute of all fraud and guile; not onely imbracing all simplicitie and truth, but also practising the same throughout the whole course of their liues: albeit certaine Latine authors, which haue written of the same regions, are farre otherwise of opinion. Likewise they are most strong and valiant people, especially those which dwell vpon the moun∣taines.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moores are a people of great fidelitie.</NOTE> They keepe their couenant most faithfully; insomuch that they had rather die then breake promise. No nation in the world is so subiect vnto iealousie; for they will rather leese their liues, then put vp any disgrace in the behalfe of their women. So desirous they are of riches and honour, that therein no other people can goe beyonde them. They trauell in a manner ouer the whole world to exercise traffique. For they are conti∣nually to bee seene in AEgypt, in AEthiopia, in Arabia, Persia, India, and Turkie: and whithersoeuer they goe, they are most hono∣rably esteemed of: for none of them will professe any arte, vnlesse hee hath attained vnto great exactnes and perfection therein. They haue al∣waies beene much delighted with all kinde of ciuilitie and modest be∣hauiour: and it is accounted heinous among them for any man to vt∣ter in companie, any bawdie or vnseemely worde. They haue alwaies in minde this sentence of a graue author; Giue place to thy superiour. If any youth in presence of his father, his vncle, or any other of his kinred, doth sing or talke ought of loue matters, he is deemed to bee woorthie of grie∣uous punishment. Whatsoeuer lad or youth there lighteth by chaunce into any company which discourseth of loue, no sooner heareth nor vnder∣standeth what their talke tendeth vnto, but immediately he withdraweth himselfe from among them. These are the things which we thought most woorthie of relation as concerning the ciuilitie, humanitie, and vpright dealing of the Barbarians: let vs now proceede vnto the residue. Those Arabians which dwell in tents, that is to say, which bring vp cattell, are of a more liberall and ciuill disposition: to wit, they are in their kinde as de∣uout, valiant, patient, courteous, hospitall, and as honest in life and conuer∣sation as any other people. They be most faithfull obseruers of their word and promise: insomuch that the people, which before we said to dwell in the mountaines, are greatly stirred vp with emulation of their vertues. Howbeit the said mountainers, both for learning, for vertue, and for religi∣on, are thought much inferiour to the Numidians; albeit they haue little or no knowledge at all in naturall philosophie. They are reported likewise to be most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> warriours, to be valiant, and exceeding louers and practi∣sers of all humanitie. Also, the Moores and Arabians inhabiting Libya are somewhat ciuill of behauiour, being plaine dealers, voide of dissimulation, fauourable to strangers, and louers of simplicitie. Those which we before named white, or tawney Moores, are most stedfast in friendship: as likewise
<PB N="41" REF="57"/>
they indifferently and fauourably esteeme of other nations: and wholy in∣deuour themselues in this one thing, namely, that they may leade a most pleasant and iocund life.

<HEAD>What vices the foresaid Africans are subiect vnto.</HEAD>
<P>NEuer was there any people or nation so perfectly endued with vertue, but that they had their contrarie faults and ble∣mishes: now therfore let vs consider, whether the vices of the Africās do surpasse their vertues &amp; good parts. Those which we named the inhabitants of the cities of Barbarie are some∣what needie and couetous, being also very proud and high-minded, and woonderfully addicted vnto wrath; insomuch that (according to the pro∣uerbe) they will deeply engraue in marble any iniurie be it neuer so small, &amp; will in no wise blot it out of their remembrance. So rusticall they are &amp; void of good manners, that scarcely can any stranger obtaine their familiaritie and friendship. Their wits are but meane; and they are so credulous, that they will beleeue matters impossible, which are told them. So ignorant are they of naturall philosophie, that they imagine all the effects and operations of nature to be extraordinarie and diuine. They obserue no certaine order of liuing nor of lawes. Abounding exceedingly with choler, they speake al∣waies with an angrie and lowd voice. Neither shall you walke in the day-time in any of their streetes, but you shall see commonly two or three of them together by the eares. By nature they are a vile and base people, being no better accounted of by their gouernours then if they were dogs. They haue neither iudges nor lawyers, by whose wisedome and counsell they ought to be directed. They are vtterly vnskilfull in trades of merchandize, being de∣stitute of bankers and money-changers: wherefore a merchant can doe no∣thing among them in his absence, but is himselfe constrained to goe in per∣son, whithersoeuer his wares are carried. No people vnder heauen are more addicted vnto couetise then this nation: neither is there (I thinke) to bee found among them one of an hundred, who for courtesie, humanitie, or de∣uotions sake, will vouchsafe any entertainment vpon a stranger. Mindfull they haue alwaies beene of iniuries, but most forgetfull of benefites. Their mindes are perpetually possessed with vexation and strife, so that they will seldome or neuer shew themselues tractable to any man; the cause whereof is supposed to be; for that they are so greedily addicted vnto their filthie lucre, that they neuer could attaine vnto any kinde of ciuilitie or good beha∣uiour. The shepherds of that region liue a miserable, toilsome, wretched and beggerly life: they are a rude people, and (as a man may say) borne and bred to theft, deceit, and brutish manners. Their yoong men may goe a wooing
<PB N="42" REF="58"/>
to diuers maides, till such time as they haue sped of a wife. Yea, the father of the maide most friendly welcommeth her suiter; so that I thinke scarce any noble or gentleman among them can chuse a virgine for his spouse: albeit, so soone as any woman is married, she is quite forsaken of all her suiters; who then seeke out other new paramours for their liking. Concerning their religion, the greater part of these people are neither Mahumetans, Iewes, nor Christians; and hardly shall you finde so much as a sparke of pietie in any of them. They haue no churches at all, nor any kinde of prayers, but be∣ing vtterly estranged from all godly deuotion, they leade a sauage and beast∣ly life: and if any man chanceth to be of a better disposition (because they haue no law-giuers nor teachers among them) he is constrained to follow the example of other mens liues &amp; maners. All the Numidians being most ignorant of naturall, domesticall, &amp; commonwealth-matters, are principal∣ly addicted vnto treason, trecherie, murther, theft, and robberie. This nation, because it is most slauish, will right gladly accept of any seruice among the Barbarians, be it neuer so vile or contemptible. For some will take vpon them to be dung-farmers, others to be scullians, some others to bee ostlers, and such like seruile occupations. Likewise the inhabitants of Libya liue a brutish kinde of life; who neglecting all kindes of good artes and sciences, doe wholy apply their mindes vnto theft and violence. Neuer as yet had they any religion, any lawes, or any good forme of liuing; but alwaies had, and euer will haue a most miserable and distressed life. There cannot any trechery or villanie be inuented so damnable, which for lucres sake they dare not attempt. They spend all their daies either in most lewd practises, or in hunting, or else in warfare; neither weare they any shooes nor garments. The Negros likewise leade a beastly kinde of life, being vtterly destitute of the vse of reason, of dexteritie of wit, and of all artes. Yea they so behaue themselues, as if they had continually liued in a forrest among wilde beasts. They haue great swarmes of harlots among them; whereupon a man may easily coniecture their manner of liuing; except <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conuersation perhaps be somewhat more tolerable, who dwell in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and cities: for it is like that they are somewhat more addicted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>Neither am I ignorant, how much mine owne credit is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when<NOTE PLACE="marg">The author of this worke his Apologie for the former relation.</NOTE> I my selfe write so homely of Africa, vnto which countrie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> debted both for my birth, and also for the best part of my education: Howbeit in this regarde I seeke not to excuse my selfe, but onely to appeale vnto the dutie of an historiographer, who is to set downe the plaine truth in all places, and is blame-woorthie for flattering or fauouring of any person. And this is the cause that hath mooued me to describe all things so plainly without glo∣sing or dissimulation: wherefore here I am to request the gentle Reader friendly to accept of this my most true discourse, (albeit not adorned with fine words, and artificiall eloquence) as of certaine vnknowne strange mat∣ters. Wherein how indifferent and sincere I haue shewed my selfe, it may in few words appeere by that which followeth. It is reported of a lewd countri∣man
<PB N="43" REF="58"/>
of ours, that being conuicted of some heinous crime, he was adiudged to be seuerely beaten for it. Howbeit the day following, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> came to doe his busines, the malefactor remembred that certaine yeeres before, he had some acquaintance and familiaritie with him: which made him to presume, that he should find more fauour at his hands, then a meere stranger. But he was fowly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; for the executioner vsed him no better, then if he had neuer knowne him. Wherefore this caitife at the first exclai∣ming vpon his executioner, oh (saith he) my goodfriend, what maketh you so sterne, as not to acknowledge our olde acquaintance? Hereupon the exe∣cutioner beating him more cruelly then before: friend (quoth he) in such busines as this I vse to be mindfull of my dutie, and to shew no fauour at all: and so continually laying on, he ceased not, till the iudiciall sentence was fulfilled. It was (doubtlesse) a great argument of impartiall dealing, when as respect of former friendship could take no place.</P>
<P>Wherefore I thought good to record all the particulars aforesaid; least that describing vices onely I should seeme to flatter them, with whom I am now presently conuersant; or extolling onely the vertues of the Africans, I might hereafter be saide to sue for their fauour (which I haue of purpose eschewed) to the end that I might haue more free accesse vnto them. More∣ouer, may it please you for this purpose to heare another resemblance or similitude. There was vpon a time a most wily bird, so indued by nature, that she could liue as well with the fishes of the sea, as with the fowles of the aire; wherefore she was rightly called Amphibia. This bird being sommoned be∣fore the king of birds to pay her yeerely tribute, determined foorthwith to change her element, and to delude the king; and so flying out of the aire, she drencht herselfe in the Ocean sea. Which strange accident the fishes woondring at, came flocking about Amphibia, saluting her, and asking her the cause of her comming. Good fishes (quoth the bird) know you not, that all things are turned so vpside downe, that we wot not how to liue securely in the aire? Our tyrannicall king (what furie haunts him, I know not) comman∣ded me to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> to death, whereas no silly bird respected euer his commoditie as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> one. Which most vniust edict I no sooner heard of, but presently (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fishes) I came to you for refuge. Wherefore vouchsafe me (I beseech <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) some odde corner or other to hide my head in; and then I may iustly say, that I haue found more friendship among strangers, then euer I did in mine owne natiue countrie. With this speech the fishes were so perswaded, that Amphibia staied a whole yeere among them, not paying one penie or halfepenie. At the yeeres ende the king of fishes began to de∣mand his tribute, insomuch that at last the bird was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to pay. Great rea∣son it is (saith the bird) that each man should haue his due, and for my part I am contented to doe the dutie of a loyall subiect. These words were no sooner spoken, but she suddenly spred her wings, and vp she mounted into the aire. And so this bird, to auoide yeerely exactions and tributes, woulde eftsoones change her element. Out of this fable I will inferre no other mo∣rall,
<PB N="44" REF="59"/>
but that all men doe most affect that place, where they finde least dam∣mage and inconuenience. For mine owne part, when I heare the Africans euill spoken of, I wil affirme my selfe to be one of Granada: and when I per∣ceiue the nation of Granada to be discommended, then will I professe my selfe to be an African. But herein the Africans shall be the more beholding vnto me; for that I will onely record their principall and notorious vices, omitting their smaller and more tolerable faults.</P>

<HEAD>Of the situation and description of Hea.</HEAD>
<P>THis region of Hea is an vneeuen and rough soile, full of rockie mountaines, shadie woods, and chrystall-streames in all places; being woonderfully rich, and wel stored with inhabitants. They haue in the said region great abundance of goates and asses, but not such plentie of sheepe, oxen, and horses. All kinde of fruites are very scarce among them, not, that the ground is vncapable of fruit, but because the people are so rude and ignorant in this behalfe, that very few of them are skilfull in planting, graffing, or pruning of trees. Whereof I was easily perswaded: for I remember that I founde among some gardiners of Hea great abundance of fruits. Of graine they haue not much plentie, except it be of barlie, mill, and panick. They haue great abundance of honie, which they vse in stead of ordinarie foode, but the waxe they cast away, little regar∣ding it, because they know not the value thereof. Likewise there are found in this region certaine thornie trees bearing a grosse kinde of fruit, not vn∣like vnto those oliues which are brought vnto vs from Spaine: the said fruit they call in their language <HI>Arga.</HI> Of this fruit they make a kinde of oile, be∣ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fruit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Arga.</NOTE> of a fulsome and strong sauour, which they vse notwithstanding for sauce and for lampes.</P>

<P>THis people for the most part eateth barlie-bread vnleuened, which is like rather vnto a cake, then to a loafe: this bread is baked in a kinde of earthen baking-pan, somewhat like vnto that wherewith in Italie they vse to couer iuncats and daintie dishes: neither shall you finde many in Hea which eate ouen-bread. They vse also a certaine vnsauourie and base kinde of meate, which in their language is called <HI>Elhasid,</HI> and is made in ma∣ner<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> following: they cast barlie-meale into boiling water, continually tem∣pering and stirring the same about with a sticke, till they perceiue it be suffi∣ciently sodden. Then setting this pap or hastie-pudding vpon the table, and powring in some of their countrie-oile, all the whole familie stand round about the platter, and eate the said pap not with spoones, but with their hands and fingers. Howbeit in the spring and summer season they temper the said meale with milke, and cast in butter in stead of oile: and this kinde of meate is not vsuall among them, but only at supper. For in winter time they breake their fast with bread and honie; and in summer with milke, butter, and bread. Moreouer sometimes they vse to eate sodden flesh, whereunto some adde onions, other beanes, and some other, a kinde of seasoning or sauce called by them <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> With them tables and table-cloathes are quite out of vse, in stead whereof they spread a certaine round mat vpon the ground, which serueth among this rude people both for table, cloth, and all.</P>

<HEAD>The apparell and customes of the foresaid people of Hea.</HEAD>
<P>THE greatest part of them are clad in a kinde of cloath-gar∣ment made of wooll after the manner of a couerlet, called in their language, <HI>Elchise,</HI> and not vnlike vnto those couerlets or blankets which the Italians lay vpon their beds. In these kinde of mantles they wrap themselues; and then are they girt with a woollen girdle, not about their waste, but about their hippes. They haue also a certaine piece of cloath of ten handfuls in length and two in bredth, wherewith they vse to adorne their heads: these kinde of orna∣ments or head-tires they dye with the iuice of walnut-tree-rootes, being so put vpon their heads, that their crownes are alwaies bare. None of them weare any cap, except it be an olde man, or a man of learning; albeit lear∣ned men are verie rare among them: which caps of theirs are double and round, not much vnlike to the caps of certaine Phisitians in Italy. You shall seldome finde any linnen shirts or smockes among this people; and that (as I suppose) either because their soile will yeeld no flaxe nor hemp, or else for that they haue none skilfull in the arte of weauing. Their seats whereon they sit, are nought else but certaine mats made of hayre and rushes. For beds they vse a certaine kinde of hairie flockbed or mattresse; some of which beds are ten elles in length, some more, and some lesse, yea some you shall finde of twenty elles long, but none longer: one part of these mattresses they lye vpon insteed of a couch, and with the residue they couer their bodies as it were with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and couerlets. In the Spring-time alwaies they lay the hairie side next vnto their bodies, because it is somewhat warmer; but in Sommer-time not regarding that side, they turne the smooth side vpwarde, and thereon they rest themselues. Likewise of such base and harsh stuffe they make their cushions: being much like vnto the stuffe which is brought hither out of Albania and Turkie, to serue for horse-cloathes: The women of Hea goe commonly with their faces vncouered, vsing for their huswifery turned vessels and cups of wood: their platters, dishes, and other their kit∣chin-vessels be for the most part of earth. You may easily discerne which of them is married, and who is not: for an vnmarried man must alwaies keepe his beard shauen, which, after hee be once married, hee suffereth to grow at length. The saide region bringeth foorth no great plentie of hor∣ses, but those that it doth bring foorth, are so nimble and full of mettall, that they will climbe like cats ouer the steepe and craggie mountaines. These horses are alwaies vnshod: and the people of this region vse to till their ground with no other cattell, but onely with horses and asses. You shall here finde great store of deere, of wilde goats, and of hares: Howbeit the people are no whit delighted in hunting. Which is the cause (as I thinke) why the said beasts do so multiply. And it is somwhat strange, that so many riuers running through the countrey, they should haue such scarsitie of wa∣ter-mils:
<PB N="47" REF="60"/>
but the reason is, because euerie houshold almost haue a woodden mill of their owne, whereat their women vsually grinde with their hands. No good learning nor liberall artes are heere to be found; except it bee a little skill in the lawes, which some few chalenge vnto themselues; other∣wise you shall finde not so much as any shadow of vertue among them. They haue neither Phisition nor Surgeon of any learning or account But if a disease or infirmitie befall any of them, they presently seare or cauterize<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cauterizing.</NOTE> the sicke partie with red hot yrons, euen as the Italians vse their horses. Howbeit some chirurgians there are among them, whose duty and occu∣pation consisteth onely in circumcising of their male children. They make no sope in all the countrey, but instead thereof they vse to wash with lee made of ashes. They are at continuall warre, but it is ciuill and among themselues, insomuch that they haue no leisure to fight against other na∣tions. Whosoeuer will trauell into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> countrey must take either a harlot, or a wife, or a religious man of the contrarie part, to beare him com∣panie. They haue no regard at all of iustice, especially in those mountaines which are destitute of gouernours or princes: yea euen the principall men of this verie region of Hea, which dwell within townes and cities, dare scarce prescribe any law or good order vnto the people, so great is their insolencie in all places. The cities of Hea are few in number, but they haue great store of villages, townes, and most strong castles: whereof (God willing) we will hereafter speake more at large.</P>

<HEAD>Of Tednest one of the cities of Hea.</HEAD>
<P>THE auncient citie of Tednest was built by the Africans vpon a most beautiful and large plaine, which they inuironed with a loftie wall built of bricke and lime. Likewise a certaine riuer running foorth of the citie serueth to fill vp the wall ditch. In this citie are certaine merchants that sell cloath, wherein the people of the same place are clad. Here is likewise vttered a kinde of cloth which is brought thither out of Portugall: howbeit they will admit no ar∣tificers, but taylors, botchers, carpenters, and a few gold-smithes which are Iewes. In this citie there are no innes, stoues, nor wine-tauerns: so that whatsoeuer merchant goes thither, must seeke out some of his acquaintance to remaine withall: but if he hath no friends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acquaintance in the town, then the principall inhabitants there cast lots who should entertaine the strange merchant: insomuch that no stranger, be he neuer so meane, shall<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of entertaining strangers at Tednest.</NOTE> want friendly entertainment, but is alwaies sumptuously and honourably accepted of. But whosoeuer is receiued as a guest, must at his departure bestow some gift vpon his host in token of thankfulnes, to the ende he may be more welcome at his next returne. Howbeit if the saide stranger bee no merchant, he may chuse what great mans house he will to lodge in, beeing bound at his departure to no recompence nor gift. To be short, if any beg∣ger
<PB N="48" REF="61"/>
or poore pilgrim passé the same way, he hath some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pro∣uided for him in a certaine hospitall, which was founded onely for the reliefe of poore people, and is maintained at the common charge of the citie. In the middest of the citie stands an auncient temple, beeing most sumptuously built and of an huge bignes, which was thought to bee founded at the verie same time when as the King of Maroco bare rule in those places. This temple hath a great cestern standing in the midst there∣of, and it hath many priests and such kinde of people which giue attendance thereunto, and store it with things necessarie. In this citie likewise are di∣uers other temples, which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are but little, yet be they most cleanly and decently kept. There are in this citie about an hundred families of Iewes, who pay no yeerely tribute at all, but only bestow each of them some gratuitie vpon this or that nobleman, whom they thinke to fauour them most, to the ende they may enioy their fauour still: and the greatest part of the said citie is inhabited with Iewes. These Iewes haue certaine minting∣houses wherein they stampe siluer coine, of which 170. Aspers (as they call them) doe weigh one ounce, beeing like vnto the common coine of Hungarie, sauing that this Asper is square, and the Hungarian coine is round. The inhabitants of Tednest are free from al tributes &amp; yeerely taxati∣ons: howbeit if any summe of money be wanting for the erection of a pub∣lique building, or for any other common vse, the people is foorthwith as∣sembled, and each man must giue according to his abilitie. This citie was left desolate in the yeere 918. of the Hegeira. At what time all the citizens<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tednest left desolate.</NOTE> thereof fled vnto the mountaines, and from thence to Maroco. The reason they say was, because the inhabitants were informed that their next neigh∣bours the Arabians ioyned in league with the Portugall Captaines (who as then held the towne of Azaphi) and promised to deliuer Tednest into the hands of the Christians, which thing so danted the citizens, that they pre∣sently sought to saue themselues by flight. My selfe (I remember) sawe this citie vtterly ruined and defaced, the walles thereof beeing laide euen with the ground, the houses beeing destitute of inhabitants, and nothing at that time to be there seene, but onely the nests of rauens and of other birds. All this I saw in the 920. yeere of the Hegeira.</P>

<P>VPon the foote of an hill eighteene miles Eastwarde from Tednest stands a towne called by the Africans Teculeth, and containing about one thousand housholdes. Hard by this towne runneth a certaine riuer, on both sides whereof are most pleasant gardens, and all kindes of trees. Within the walles of the saide towne are many pits or wels, whereout they draw most cleere and pleasant water. Here also is to be seene a most stately and beau∣tifull temple; as likewise fower hospitals and a monasterie of religious per∣sons.
<PB N="49" REF="61"/>
The inhabitants of this towne are farre wealthier then they of Ted∣nest; for they haue a most famous port vpon the Ocean sea, commonly cal∣led by merchants, Goz. They haue likewise great abundance of corne and pulse, which grow in the fruitfull fields adiacent. These also of Teculeth send waxe into Portugall to be solde: and they are verie curious in their ap∣parell<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> and about the furniture of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. When I my selfe was at Te∣culeth, I found there a certaine nobleman, who was the president or chiefe of their senate: this noblemans duety was both to procure tribute which was yeerely to be payed vnto the Arabians, and also to make attonement and reconciliation betweene them, when they were at ods. This man had gathered great riches vnto himselfe, which he imployed rather to purchase friends, then to fill his coffers: most liberall he was vnto the poore, most bountifull and fauourable vnto all his citizens; insomuch that all men did reuerence and honour vnto him, as vnto their father and best protectour. Of whose curtesie I my selfe also made triall: and being not meanely but verie sumptuously entertained by him, I remained with him for a certaine time, and read in his house diuers histories of African matters. This good man togither with his sonne was slaine in a skirmish against the Portugals: which was done, according to our computation, in the yeere of the He∣geira 923. that is to say, in the yeere of our Lord 1514. After which misfor∣tune<NOTE PLACE="marg">Teculeth de∣stroyed by the Portugals.</NOTE> we heard, that the citie was razed, that the people were part of them put to flight, part lead captiue, and the residue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the enimy: all which particulars we haue declared more at large in that Booke, which is now late∣ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">1514.</NOTE> printed and published concerning African affaires.</P>

<HEAD>Of Hadecchis a towne of Hea.</HEAD>
<P>THE citie of Hadecchis being situate vpon a plaine, standeth eight miles Southward of Teculeth: it containeth seauen hun∣dred families: and the wals, churches, and houses throughout this whole citie are all built of free stone. Through the midst of the towne runneth a large and faire streame, hauing many vines &amp; galleries on both sides thereof. There be many Iewes artificers in this citie. The ci∣tizens here go somewhat decently apparelled: their horses are good: most of them exercise merchandize: also they stampe a kinde of coine; and they haue certaine yeerely faires or martes, whereunto the nations adioining do vsually resort. Here is to be sold great store of cattell, of butter, oyle, yron, and cloath, and their said mart lasteth fifteene dayes. Their women are very beautifull, white of colour, fat, comely, and trim. But the men beare a most sauage minde, being so extremely possessed with ielousie, that whomsoeuer they finde but talking with their wiues, they presently goe about to murther them. They haue no iudges nor learned men among them, nor any which can assigne vnto the citizens any functions and magistracies according to their worthines: so that hee rules like a king that excelleth the residue in

Heere I was entertained by a cer∣taine curteous and liberall minded priest, who was exceedingly delighted with Arabian Poetrie. Wherefore being so louingly entertained, I read vnto him a certaine briefe treatise as touching the same argument: which he accepted so kindly at my hands, that he would not suffer mee to depart without great and bountifull rewards. From hence I trauelled vnto Maroco. And afterward I heard that this towne also, in the yeere of the Hegeira<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hadecchis sac∣ked by the Portugals.</NOTE> 922. was sacked by the Portugals, and that the inhabitants were all fled into the next mountaines, and the verie same yeere I returned home to visit my<NOTE PLACE="marg">1513.</NOTE> natiue countrey, which was in the yeere of our Lord 1513.</P>

<HEAD>Of Ileusugaghen a towne of Hea.</HEAD>
<P>THis towne is situate vpon the top of a certaine high mountaine which is distant eight miles to the South of Hadecchis: it consisteth of about two hundred families: and by the foote of the hill runneth a small riuer. Heere are no gardens at all, nor yet any trees which beare fruit: the reason whereof is (as I suppose) because the inhabitants are such sloth∣full and grosse people, that they regard nothing but their barley and their oyle. They are at continuall warre with their next neighbours, which is per∣formed with such monstrous bloodshed and manslaughter, that they de∣serue rather the name of beasts then of men. They haue neither iudges, priests, nor lawyers, to prescribe any forme of liuing among them, or to go∣uerne their common-wealth: wherefore iustice and honestie is quite bani∣shed out of their habitations. Those mountaines are altogither destitute of fruits: howbe it they abound greatly with honie, which serueth the inhabi∣tants both for food, and for merchandize to sell in the neighbour-countries. And because they know not what seruice to put their waxe vnto, they cast it foorth, togither with the other excrements of honie. The saide towne of Ileusugaghen hath a verie small and narrow chappell, which will scarce con∣taine a hundred persons, whither notwithstanding the people doe so slowly resort, that they need not to haue any greater; so much do they neglect re∣ligion and pietie. Whensoeuer they goe abroad, they carrie a dagger or a iauelin about with them: and you shall often heare of the slaughter of some one or other of their citizens. No people vnder heauen can be more wic∣ked, trecherous, or lewdly addicted, then this people is.</P>
<P>I remember that I my selfe went once thither with a Seriffo or Mahumetan priest, (who made chalenge vnto the gouernment of Hea) to the ende that we might arbitrate certaine strifes and contentions: for it were incredible to report, what cruell warres, partly for murthers, and partly for robberies, were practised among them. But because the Seriffo had brought no lawyers with him, nor any iudges to decide controuersies, he would needes, that I
<PB N="51" REF="62"/>
should take that office vpon me. Immediately the townsmen come floc∣king about vs: one complaines that his neighbour hath slaine eight of his kinred and family; his neighbour on the contrarie alleageth, that the for∣mer had slaine ten of his familie; wherefore, according to the auncient cu∣stome, he demaundeth to haue a summe of money giuen him. For (saith he) there is some recompence due vnto me, sithens ten of my people haue beene slaine, and but eight of this my neighbours. Whereunto the other replied that the saide ten persons were iustly slaine, because they went about by violence to dispossesse him of a certaine piece of ground which his fa∣ther had left him by inheritance; but, that his eight were murthered onely for vniust reuenge, against all equitie and lawe. With these and such like friuolous allegations we spent that whole day, neither could we decide any one controuersie. About midnight we sawe a great throng of people meet in the market-place, who made there such a bloodie and horrible conflict, that the sight thereof would haue affrighted any man, were he neuer so hard harted. Wherefore the saide Seriffo fearing least those lewd varlets would make some trecherous conspiracie against him, and thinking it better to depart thence immediately, then to expect the conclusion of that fraye, wee tooke our iourney from that place to a towne called Aghilinghighil.</P>

<P>MOreouer, the tower of Teijeut standing vpon a plaine ten miles Westward of Ileusugaghen, containeth about three hundred housholdes. The houses and wall of this towne are built of bricke. The townesmen exercise husbandrie; for their ground is most fertile for barley; albeit it will scarcely yeeld any other graine. They haue pleasant and large gardens, stored with vines, fig-trees, and peach∣trees: also they haue great abundance of goates. About this towne are ma∣ny lyons, whereby the townesmen are not a little endamaged: for they pray continually vpon their goats and vpon other of their cattell. Certaine of vs vpon time comming into these parts for want of a lodging were cōstrained to repayre vnto a little cottage which we escried, being so olde, that it was in danger of falling: hauing prouided our horses of prouender, we stopped vp all the doores and passages of the said cottage with thornes and wood, as cir∣cumspectly as possibly we could: these things happened in the moneth of Aprill, at what time they haue extreme heat in the same countrey. Where∣fore we our selues got vp to the top of the house, to the end that in our sleep we might be neere vnto the open ayer. About midnight we espied two mon∣strous lyons, who were drawen thither by the sent of our horses, and endeuo∣red to breake downe that fence of thornes which we had made. Where∣upon the horses being put in feare, kept such a neighing, and such a stirre, that we misdoubted least the rotten cottage would haue fallen, and least our selues should haue become a pray vnto the lyons. But so soone as we per∣ceiued

At euery gate of Tesegdelt stande certaine watchmen or warders, which do most louingly receiue all incommers, enquiring of them, whether they haue any friends and acquaintaine in the towne, or no? If they haue none, then are they conducted to one of the best Innes of the towne, and hauing had en∣tertainment there, according to their degree and place, they are friendly dis∣missed: and whatsoeuer his expences come to, the stranger paies nought at all, but his charges are defraied out of the common purse. This people of Tesegdelt are subiect also vnto iealousie; howbeit they are most faithfull keepers of their promise.

<HEAD>A description of the citie of Tagtess.</HEAD>
<P>THE most ancient citie of Tagtess is built rounde, and standeth vpon the toppe of an hill: on the sides whereof are certaine winding steps hewen out of the hard rocke. It is about foure∣teene miles distant from Tesegdelt. By the foote of the saide hill runnes a riuer, whereout the women of Tagtess draw their water, nei∣ther haue the citizens any other drinke: and although this riuer be almost sixe miles from Tagtess, yet a man would thinke, looking downe from the citie vpon it, that it were but halfe a mile distant. The way leading vnto the said riuer being cut out of the rocke, in forme of a payre of stayres, is verie narrow. The citizens of Tagtess are addicted vnto theft and robberie, and are at continuall warre with their neighbours. They haue no corne-fields, nor any cattell, but onely vpon the said mountaine: they haue great store of bores; but such scarcitie of horses, that there is not one almost to bee found in the whole citie. The way through their region is so difficult, that they will suffer none to passe by without a publique testimoniall. While I<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> was in that countrey, there came such a swarme of Locusts, that they deuou∣red the greatest part of their cornes which were as then ripe: insomuch that all the vpper part of the ground was couered with Locusts.

said lawyers deale onely in common-wealth matters, but also in cases pertai∣ning to religion: albeit in criminall cases the people doe not so greatly cre∣dit them, for indeede their learning little serueth them for that purpose. Being amongst them, it was my hap to soiourne in the house of a certaine lawyer, who was a man of great learning. This lawyer, to the end he might giue me more solemne entertainmēt, would needs inuite diuers learned men of his owne profession to beare vs companie at supper. After supper, we had many questions propounded: and amongst the residue this was one; name∣ly, Whether any man might iustly sell that person for a bondflaue, who is nourished by any commoditie of the people. There was in companie at the same time a certaine aged Sire, hauing a graue beard and a reuerend coun∣tenance, vnto whom each one of them ascribed much honour; him they called in their owne language <HI>Hegazzare.</HI> Which name, when I had heard thrice or fower times repeated, I demanded of some that were in presence, what was the true signification thereof. They told me that it signified a but∣cher: for (say they) as a butcher knoweth right well the true anatomy of eue∣ry part of a beast; euen so can this aged Sire most learnedly dissolue all dif∣ficult questions &amp; doubts of lawe. This people leadeth a most miserable and distressed life: their foode is barlie bread, oile arganicke, and goates-flesh. They know no vse of any other graine but barlie.

He was the chiefe cause of the de∣struction and ruine of the whole prouince. At length he was slaine by his owne wife, because he had vnlawfully lien with her daughter which she had by her former husband. And then was his peruerse and lewd dealing laide open vnto all men; for he is reported to haue beene vtterly ignorant of the

Howbeit the nephew of the said apo∣stata was left aliue; who afterward in the same castle endured a whole yeeres siege of his aduersaries, and repelled them, insomuch that they were con∣strained to depart. Yea euen vntill this day he molesteth the people of Hea, and those which inhabite neere vnto him, with continuall warre, liuing vpon robberie and spoile; for which purpose he hath certaine horsemen, which are appointed to watch and to pursue trauellers, sometimes taking cattel, and sometimes men captiues. He hath likewise certaine gunners, who, although trauellers be a good distance off (for the common high way standeth almost a mile from the castle) will put them in great feare. Howbeit all people doe so deadly hate him, that they will not suffer him to till one foote of ground, or to beare any dominion without the said mountaine.

<P>NEere vnto the Ocean sea standeth a citie, most strong both for situation and building, commonly called Tefethne, be∣ing westward of Ingilingigil about fortie miles. They say that this towne was built by certaine Africans, and that it containeth more then sixe hundred housholds. Here ships of meane burthen may safely harbour themselues; and hither the Portugall merchants resort to buy goats-skins and waxe. Corne-fields they haue none, but onely certaine hils, which yeeld great increase of barlie. Neere vnto this towne runs a certaine riuer, whereinto the ships put themselues in tempe∣stuous weather. The towne-wall is built of white hewen stone and of bricke. They gather their yeerely customes and subsidies; all the whole summe whereof is equally distributed among such citizens as are meete for the warres. In this towne are great plentie of Mahumetan priests and of iudges; howbeit, for the inquirie of murther and such like crimes these iudges haue no authoritie. For if any kinsman of the slaine or wounded partie meeteth<NOTE PLACE="marg">A punishment of murther.</NOTE> with him that did the fact, he is presently without any iudgement to haue <HI>Legem talionis,</HI> that is, like for like, inflicted vpon him: but if he escape that, he is banished seuen yeeres out of the citie: at the end of which seuen yeeres the malefactor hauing paide a certaine summe of money to the friends of the wounded or slaine partie, is afterward receiued into fauour, and accoun∣ted among the number of citizens. All the inhabitants of Tefethne are of a most white colour, being so addicted vnto friendship and hospitalitie, that they fauour strangers more then their owne citizens. They haue a most stately and rich hospitall; howbeit those which are there placed may for the most part remaine in citizens houses. My selfe being in companie with the Seriffo or Mahumetan prelate, continued for the space of three daies among this people; which three daies seemed three yeeres vnto me, both for the incredible number of fleas, and also for the most lothsome and intolerable stench of pisse, and of goates dung.

The bredth of this mountaine is three daies iourney. For Tefethne, whereat this mountaine beginneth from the north, is distant from the towne of Messa, where it endeth southward, as farre as I coulde conueniently ride in three daies. Whosoeuer knoweth this region as well as my selfe, can sufficiently beare me witnes, howe it is replenished with inhabitants and countrey-villages. Their ordinary food is barly, goates∣flesh, and hony. Shirts they weare none at all, nor yet any other garments which are sowen togither; for there is no man among them which knoweth how to vse the needle: but such apparell as they haue, hangeth by a knot vpon their shoulders. Their women weare siluer rings vpon their eares, some three, and some more. They haue siluer buttons of so great a scant∣ling, that each one weigheth an ounce, wherewith they fasten their apparell vpon their shoulders, to the end it may not fall off. The nobler and richer sort of people among them weare siluer rings vpon their fingers and legs, but such as are poore weare ringes onely of iron or of copper. There are likewise certaine horses in this region, being so small of stature and so swift, as it is woonderfull. Heere may you finde great plentie of wilde goats, hares, and deere, and yet none of the people are delighted in hunting. Many fountaines are heere to be founde, and great aboundance of trees, but espe∣cially of walnut-trees. The greater part of this people liueth after the Ara∣bians manner, often changing their places of habitation. A kinde of dag∣gers they vse whieh are broad and crooked like a wood-knife; and their swords are as thicke as sithes, wherewith they mowe haie. When they go to the warres they carrie three or fower hunting toiles with them. In al the said mountaine are neither iudges, priestes, nor temples to be founde. So igno∣rant they are of learning, that not one among them either loueth or embra∣ceth the same. They are all most lewd and wicked people, and applie their mindes vnto all kinde of villanie.

They haue store of boxe, of mastick, and of high walnut trees. Vnto their Argans (for so they call a kinde of oliues which they haue) they put nuts; out of which two simples they expresse very bitter oile, vsing it for a sauce to some of their meates, and powring it into their lampes.

Through these three runneth a certaine great riuer called Sus in their lan∣guage: this riuer in sommer is so destitute of water, that a man may easilie without perill passe ouer it on foote; but it is not so in the winter time. They haue then certaine small barkes, which are not meete to saile vpon this ri∣uer. The place where the foresaide three townes are situate, aboundeth greatly with palme trees, neither haue they in a manner any other wealth; and yet their dates are but of small woorth, because they will not last aboue<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dates which will last but one yeere.</NOTE> one yeere. All the inhabitants exercise husbandry, especially in the moneths of September and Aprill; what time their riuer encreaseth. And in May their corne groweth to ripenes. But if in the two foresaide moneths the riuer encreaseth not according to the woonted manner, their haruest is then nothing woorth. Cattell are very scarce among them. Not farre from the sea side they haue a temple, which they greatly esteeme and honour. Out of which, Historiographers say, that the same prophet, of whom their great Mahumet foretold, shoulde proceed. Yea, some there are which sticke not to affirme, that the prophet <HI>Ionas</HI> was cast foorth by the whale vpon the shoare of Messa, when as he was sent to preach vnto the Niniuites.

vpon their shore, which by reason of their hugenes and strange deformitie, may terrifie and astonish the beholders. The common people imagine, that, by reason of a certaine secret power and vertue infused from heauen by God vpon the saide temple, each whale which woulde swim past it can by no meanes escape death. Which opinion had almost perswaded me; especial∣ly when at my being there, I my selfe sawe a mightie whale cast vp: vnlesse a certaine Iewe had tolde me, that it was no such strange matter: for (quoth he) there lie certaine rockes two miles into the sea on either side; and as the sea mooues, so the whales mooue also; and if they chaunce to light vpon a rock, they are easily wounded to death, and so are cast vpon the next shore. This reason more preuailed with me then the opinion of the people. My selfe (I remember) being in this region at the same time when my Lord the Seriffo bare rule ouer it, was inuited by a certaine gentleman, and was by him conducted into a garden: where he shewed me a whales rib of so great<NOTE PLACE="marg">A whales rib of incredible greatnes.</NOTE> a size, that lying vpon the grounde with the conuexe or bowing side vp∣warde in manner of an arche, it resembled a gate, the hollow or inwarde part whereof aloft we could not touch with our heads, as we rode vpon our camels backs: this rib (he said) had lien there aboue an hundred yeeres, and was kept as a miracle. Here may you finde vpon the sea-shore great store of amber, which the Portugal, &amp; Fessan merchāts fetch from thence for a very<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amber.</NOTE> meane price: for they scarcely pay a duckat for a whole ounce of most choise and excellent amber.

In the midst of this citie standeth a faire and stately temple, which they call The greatest, and the chiefest, through the very midst whereof they haue caused a part of the foresaid riuer to runne. The inhabitants are sterne and vnciuill, being so continually exercised in warres, that they haue not one day of quiet. Each part of the citie hath a seuerall captaine and gouernour, who all of them to∣gether doe rule the common-wealth: but their authoritie continueth neuer aboue three moneths, which being expired, three other are chosen in their roume. Their apparell is some what like vnto that of the people of Hea: sa∣uing that some of them make their shirtes, and other of their garments of a certaine kinde of white stuffe. A Canna (which is a measure proper to this region, containing two elles) of course cloth is solde for halfe a peece of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good sale for cloth.</NOTE> gold: but fower and twentie elles of Portugall or Neatherlandish cloth, if it be any thing fine, is vsually sold there for fower peeces of their gold. Like∣wise in this towne are many iudges and priests, which are conuersant onely in matters of religion: but in ciuill matters, he that hath most friends, ob∣taineth greatest fauour. Whensoeuer any one is slaine, all the friends of the slaine partie doe foorthwith conspire to kill the murtherer.

<HEAD>A most exact description of the great and famous citie of Maroco.</HEAD>
<P>THis noble citie of Maroco in Africa is accounted to be one of the greatest cities in the whole world. It is built vpon a most large field, being about fourteene miles distant from Atlas. One <HI>Ioseph</HI> the sonne of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first foun∣der of Maroco.</NOTE> <HI>Tesfin,</HI> and king of the tribe or people called Luntuna, is reported to haue beene the founder of this citie, at that very time when he conducted his troupes into the region of Maroco, and setled himselfe not farre from the common high way, which stretcheth from Agmet ouer the mountaines of Atlas, to those deserts where the foresaid tribe or people doe vsually inhabite. Here may you behold most stately and woonderfull workmanship: for all their buil∣dings are so cunningly and artificially contriued, that a man cannot easily describe the same. This huge and mighty citie, at such time as it was gouer∣ned by <HI>Hali</HI> the sonne of king <HI>Ioseph,</HI> contained moe then 100000. families.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maroco in times past con∣tained aboue 100000. fami∣lies.</NOTE> It had fower and twenty gates belonging thereto, and a wall of great strength and thicknes, which was built of white stone and lime. From this citie the riuer of Tensift lieth about sixe miles distant. Here may you behold great abundance of temples, of colleges, of bath-stoues, and of innes, all framed after the fashion and custome of that region. Some were built by the king of the tribe of Luntuna, and others by <HI><UNCLEAR>Elmunchidin</UNCLEAR></HI> his successor: but the most curious and magnificent temple of all, is that in the midst of the citie which was built by <HI>Hali</HI> the first king of Maroco, and the son of <HI>Ioseph</HI> afore∣said, being commonly called the temple of <HI>Hali ben Ioseph.</HI> Howbeit one <HI>Abdul-Mumen</HI> which succeeded him, to the ende he might vtterly abo∣lish the name of <HI>Hali,</HI> and might make himselfe onely famous with posteri∣tie, caused this stately temple of Maroco to be razed, and to bee reedified somewhat more sumptuously then before. Howbeit he lost not onely his expences, but failed of his purpose also: for the common people euen till this day doe call the said Temple by the first and auncientest name. Likewise in this citie not farre from a certaine rocke was built a Tem∣ple by him that was the seconde vsurper ouer the kingdome of Maro∣co:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mansor the king of Ma∣roco.</NOTE> after whose death his nephew <HI>Mansor</HI> enlarged the saide Temple fiftie cubites on all sides, and adorned the same with manye pillars, which he commanded to be brought out of Spaine for that purpose. Vnder this temple he made a cesterne or vault as bigge as the temple it selfe: the roofe of the saide temple he couered with lead: and at euery corner he made leaden pipes to conueigh raine water into the cesterne vnderneath the tem∣ple. The turret or steeple is built of most hard and well framed stone, like vn∣to <HI>Vespasian</HI> his Amphitheatrum at Rome, containing in compasse moe then an hundreth elles, and in height exceeding the steeple of Bononia. The
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
staires of the said turret or steeple are each of them nine handfuls in bredth, the vtmost side of the wall is ten, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Obscurum.</NOTE> the thicknes of the turret is fiue. The saide turret hath seauen lofts, vnto which the staires ascending are very lightsome: for there are great store of windowes, which to the ende they may giue more light, are made broader within then without. Vpon the top of this turret is built a certaine spire or pinnacle rising sharpe in forme of a sugar-loafe, and containing fiue and twentie elles in compasse, but in height being not much more then two speares length: the saide spire hath three lofts one aboue another, vnto euerie of which they ascend with woodden ladders. Likewise on the top of this spire standeth a golden halfe moone, vpon a barre of iron, with three spheares of golde vnder it; which golden spheares are so fastened vnto the saide iron barre, that the greatest is lowest, and the least highest. It woulde make a man giddie to looke downe from the top of the turret; for men walking on the grounde, be they neuer so tall, seeme no bigger then a childe of one yeere old. From hence likewise may you plainly escrie the promontorie of Azaphi, which notwithstanding is an hundreth and thirtie miles distant. But mountaines (you will say) by rea∣son of their huge bignes may easily be seene a farre off: howbeit from this turret a man may in cleere weather most easily see fiftie miles into the plaine countries. The inner part of the saide temple is not very beautifull. But the roofe is most cunningly and artificially vaulted, the timbers being fra∣med and set togither with singular workmanship, so that I haue not seene many fairer temples in all Italy. And albeit you shall hardly finde any temple in the whole worlde greater then this, yet is it very meanly frequen∣ted; for the people do neuer assemble there but onely vpon fridaies. Yea a great part of this citie, especially about the foresaid temple lieth so desolate and void of inhabitants, that a man cannot without great difficultie passe, by reason of the ruines of many houses lying in the way. Vnder the porch<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great store of bookes in olde time to be sold in Maroco.</NOTE> of this temple it is reported that in old time there were almost an hundreth shops of sale-bookes, and as many on the other side ouer against them: but at this time I thinke there is not one booke-seller in all the whole citie to be founde. And scarcely is the third part of this citie inhabited. Within the wals of Maroco are vines, palme-trees, great gardens, and most fruitefull corne-fields: for without their wals they can till no ground, by reason of the Arabians often inrodes. Know yee this for a certaintie, that the saide citie is growen to vntimely decay and old age: for scarcely fiue hundreth &amp; sixe yeeres are past, since the first building thereof, forasmuch as the foundations thereof were laide in the time of <HI>Ioseph</HI> the sonne of <HI>Tesfin,</HI> that is to say, in the 424. yeere of the Hegeira. Which decay I can impute to none other cause, but to the iniurie of continuall warres, and to the often alterations of magistrates and of the common wealth. After king <HI>Ioseph</HI> succeeded his sonne <HI>Hali,</HI> and the sonne of <HI>Hali</HI> was ordained gouernour after his fathers decease. In whose time sprung vp a factious crue, by the meanes of a certaine Mahumetan preacher named <HI>Elmaheli,</HI> being a man both borne &amp; brought
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
vp in the mountaines. The saide <HI>Elmaheli</HI> hauing leuied a great army, wa∣ged warre against <HI>Abraham</HI> his soueraigne Lord. Whereupon king <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> conducting another armie against him, had marueilous ill successe: and after the battaile ended, his passage into the citie of Maroco was so stop∣ped and restrained, that he was forced with a fewe soldiers, which remained yet aliue, to flee eastward to the mountains of Atlas. But <HI>Elmaheli</HI> not be∣ing satisfied with expelling his true soueraigne out of his owne kingdome, commaunded one of his captaines called <HI>Abdul Mumen,</HI> with the one halfe of his armie to pursue the distressed king, while himselfe with the other halfe laide siege to Maroco. The king with his followers came at length vn∣to Oran, hoping there to haue renued his forces. But <HI>Abdul Mumen</HI> and his great armie pursued the saide king so narrowly, that the citizens of Oran told him in plaine termes, that they would not hazard themselues for him. Wherefore this vnhappie king beeing vtterly driuen to dispayre, set his Queene on horsebacke behinde him, and so in the night time road foorth of the citie. But perceiuing that he was descried and knowen by his eni∣mies, he fled foorthwith vnto a certaine rocke standing vpon the sea-shore:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The miserable death of Abra∣ham king of Maroco and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>.</NOTE> where, setting spurs to his horse-side, he cast himselfe, his most deere spouse, and his horse downe headlong, and was within a while after found slaine among the rockes and stones, by certaine which dwelt neere vnto the place. Wherefore <HI>Abdul Mumen</HI> hauing gotten the victorie, returned in triumphant manner toward Maroco, where the foresaide <HI>Elmaheli</HI> was de∣ceased before his comming, in whose place <HI>Abdul</HI> was chosen King and Mahumetan prelate ouer the fortie disciples, and tooke tenne persons to be of his priuie councell, which was a new inuention in the law of Mahumet. This <HI>Abdul Mumen</HI> hauing besieged the citie of Maroco for the space of an whole yeere, at last ouercame it: and killing <HI>Isaac</HI> the onely sonne of King <HI>Abraham</HI> with his owne hand, he commaunded all the soldiers, and a good part of the citizens to be slaine. This mans posteritie raigned from the fiue hundred sixteenth, to the sixe hundred sixtie eight yeere of the He∣geira, and at length they were dispossessed of the kingdome by a certaine king of the Tribe called <HI>Marin.</HI> Now, attend (I beseech you) and marke, what changes and alterations of estates befell afterwards. The family of <HI>Marin</HI> after the said kings decease bare rule till the yeere of the Hegeira 785. At length the kingdome of Maroco decreasing dayly more and more, was gouerned by kings which came out of the next mountaine. Howbeit, neuer had Maroco any gouernours which did so tyrannize ouer it, as they of the family called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> The principall court of this family was holden for the most part at Fez; but ouer Maroco were appointed Vice-royes and deputies: insomuch that Fez was continually the head and Metropolitan citie of all Mauritania, and of all the Western dominion: euen as (God willing) we will declare more at large in our briefe treatise concerning the law and religion of Mahumet. But now hauing made a sufficient digression, let vs resume the matter subiect where we left. In the said citie of Maroco is
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
a most impregnable castle, which, if you consider the bignes, the walles, the towers, and the gates built all of perfect marble, you may well thinke to be a citie rather then a castle. Within this castle there is a stately temple, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and high steeple, on the top where of standeth an halfe moone, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vnder the halfe moone are three golden spheares one bigger then ano∣ther, which all of them togither weigh 130000. ducates. Some kings there<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three golden sphears.</NOTE> were, who being allured with the value, went about to take downe the saide golden sphears: but they had alwaies some great misfortune or other, which hindered their attempt: insomuch that the common people thinke it verie dangerous, if a man doth but offer to touch the said sphears with his hand. Some affirme that they are there placed by so forcible an influence of the planets, that they cannot be remooued from thence by any cunning or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Some others report that a certaine spirite is adiured by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-magique; to defend those sphears from al assaults and iniuries whatsoeuer. In our time the king of Maroco neglecting the vulgar opinion, would haue taken down the said sphears, to vse them for treasure against the Portugals, who as then prepared themselues to battell against him. Howbeit his counsellours would not suffer him so to doe, for that they esteemed them as the princi∣pall monuments of all Maroco. I remember that I read in a certaine histo∣riographer, that the wife of King <HI>Mansor,</HI> to the ende she might be famous in time to come, caused those three sphears to be made of the princely and pretious iewels which her husband <HI>Mansor</HI> bestowed vpon her, and to be placed vpon the temple which he built. Likewise the said castle containeth a most noble college, which hath thirtie hals belonging thereunto. In the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great college.</NOTE> midst whereof is one hall of a maruellous greatnes, wherein publique <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were most solemnely read, while the studie of learning flourished among them. Such as were admitted into this college had their victuals and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> freely giuen them. Of their professours some were yeerely al∣lowed an hundred, and some two hundred ducates, according to the quali∣tie of their profession: neither would they admit any to heare them read, but such as perfectly vnderstood what belonged to those Arts which they professed. The walles of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hall are most stately adorned with painting and caruing, especially of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hall where lectures were woont publiquely to be read. All their porches and vaulted roofes are made of painted and glittering stones, called in their language <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> such as are yet vsed in Spaine. In the midst of the said building is a most pleasant and cleare fountaine, the wall whereof is of white and polished <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, albeit low-built, as in Africa for the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such wals are. I haue heard that in old time here was great abundance of students, but at my beeing there I found but fiue in all: and they haue now a most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> professour, and one that is quite voide of all humanitie.</P>
<P>In the time of mine abode at Maroco I grew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> acquaintance with a certaine Iewe, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his skill in the law was but meane, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exceeding rich and well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in histories. This Iewe in re∣gard
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
of many singular duties which he performed to his prince, found the kings bountie and liberalitie extended vnto him. All others which beare any publike office are (in mine opinion) men of no high reach. Moreouer the foresaide castell (as I remember) hath twelue courts most curiously and artificially built by one <HI>Mansor.</HI> In the first lodged about fiue hundreth Christians, which carried crosse-bowes before the king whither soeuer he went. Not farre from thence is the lodging of the Lord Chancellour and of the kings priuie counsell, which house is called by them, The house of af∣faires. The third is called The court of victorie; wherein all the armour and munition of the citie is laide vp. The fourth belongeth to the great Master of the kings horse. Vpon this court three stables adioine, each one of which stables will containe two hundreth horses. Likewise there are two other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, wherof one is for mules, and the other for an hundreth of the kings horses onely. Next vnto the stables were two barnes or garners adioining, in two seuerall places, in the lower of which barnes was laide straw, and barly in the other. There is also another most large place to laye vp corne in, euerie roume whereof will containe moe then three hundreth bushels. The couer of the saide roume hath a certaine hole whereunto they ascend by staires made of stone. Whither the beasts laden with corne being come, they powre the saide corne into the hole. And so when they woulde take any corne from thence, they do but open certaine holes below, suffring so much corne to come foorth as may serue their turnes, and that without any labour at all. There is likewise a certaine other hall, where the kings sonne, and the sonnes of noble men are instructed in learning. Then may you be∣holde a certaine fower-square building, containing diuers galleries with faire glasse windowes, in which galleries are many histories most curiously painted: heere likewise the glittering and gilt armour is to be seene. Next vnto this building is another, wherein certaine of the kings guard are lod∣ged: then followes that wherein state-matters are discussed: whereunto ad∣ioineth also another, which is appointed for ambassadours to conferre with the kings priuie counsell in. Likewise the kings concubines and other la∣dies of honour haue a most conuenient place assigned them: next vnto which standeth the lodging of the kings sonnes. Not farre from the castell wall, on that side which is next vnto the fields, may you behold a most plea∣sant and large garden, containing almost all kinde of trees that can be na∣med. Moreouer, there is a sumptuous and stately porch built of most ex∣cellent square marble: in the midst whereof standeth a piller with a lion very artificially made of marble, out of the mouth of which lion issueth most cleere and christall water, falling into a cesterne within the porch: at each corner of the saide porch standeth the image of a leopard framed of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excellent spot∣ted marble.</NOTE> white marble, which is naturally adorned with certaine blacke spots: this kinde of particoloured marble is no where to be founde but onely in a cer∣taine place of Atlas, which is about an hundreth &amp; fiftie miles distant from Maroco. Not farre from the garden stands a certaine woode or parke wal∣led
<PB N="73" REF="73"/>
round about: And here I thinke no kinde of wilde beasts are wanting: for heere you may behold elephants, lions, stagges, roes, and such like: how∣beit the lions are separated in a certaine place from other beasts, which place euen to this day is called The lions den. Wherefore such monuments of antiquity as are yet extant in Maroco, albeit they are but few, do not with∣standing sufficiently argue, what a noble citie it was in the time of <HI>Mansor.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This king called Mansor was he vnto whom Rasis that fa∣mous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dedicated his Booke.</NOTE> At this present al the courts and lodgings before described lie vtterly voide and desolate: except perhaps some of the kings ostlery which tend his mules and horses do lie in that court, which we saide euen now was to lodge ar∣chers and crossebowe-men: all the residue are left for the fowles of the aire to nestle in. That garden which you might haue named a paradise in olde time, is now become a place where the filth and dung of the whole citie is cast foorth. Where the faire and stately librarie was of old, at this present there is nothing else to be founde, but hens, dooues, and other such like foules, which builde their nests there. Certaine it is, that the foresaid <HI>Man∣sor,</HI> whom we haue so often mentioned, was a most puissant and mightie prince: for it is well knowen that his dominion stretched from the towne of Messa to the kingdome of Tripolis in Barbary, which is the most excellent region of Africa, and so large, that a man can hardly trauell the length<NOTE PLACE="marg">The huge do∣minions of king Mansor.</NOTE> therof in fourescore &amp; ten daies, or the bredth in fifteene. This <HI>Mansor</HI> like∣wise was in times past Lord of all the kingdome of Granada in Spaine. Yea, his dominion in Spaine extended from Tariffa to Aragon, &amp; ouer a great part of Castilia and of Portugall. Neither did this <HI>Iacob</HI> surnamed <HI>Mansor</HI> only possesse the foresaid dominiōs, but also his grandfather <HI>Abdul Mumen,</HI> his father <HI>Ioseph,</HI> &amp; his sonne <HI>Mahumet Enasir,</HI> who being vanquished in the kingdome of Valençia, lost 60000. soldiers horsemen &amp; footemen: howbeit himselfe escaped &amp; returned to Maroco. The Christians being encouraged<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Christians happie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against the Moores.</NOTE> with this victorie, refrained not from warre, till, within 30. yeeres space, they had woon all the townes following, to wit, Valençia, Denia, Alcauro, Mur∣cia, Cartagena, Cordoua, Siuillia, Iaen, and Vbeda. After which vnhappie warre succeeded the decay of Maroco. The said Mahumet deceasing, left behinde him ten sonnes of a full and perfect age, who contended much about the kingdome. Hereupon it came to passe, while the brethren were at discord, and assailed each other with mutuall warres, that the people of Fez called Marini, and the inhabitants of other regions adiacent, began to vsurpe the gouernment. The people called Habdulvad enioyed Tremizen, expel∣ling the king of Tunis, and ordaining some other, whom they pleased, in his stead. Now haue you heard the end of <HI>Mansor</HI> his progenie and successors. The kingdome therefore was translated vnto one <HI>Iacob</HI> the sonne of <HI>Habdu∣lach,</HI> who was the first king of the familie called Marin. And at length the famous citie of Maroco it selfe, by reason of the Arabians continuall out∣rages, fell into most extreme calamitie: so great is the inconstancie of all earthly things. That which we haue here reported as touching Maroco, partly we saw with our owne eies, partly we read in the historie of one <HI>Ibnu</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibnu Abdul.</NOTE>

<HEAD>Of the towne of Agmet.</HEAD>
<P>THE towne of Agmet built of old by the Africans vpon the top of a certaine hill which beginneth almost from Atlas, is distant from Ma∣roco about fower and twentie miles. In times past, when <HI>Muachidin</HI> was prince thereof, it contained moe then sixe thousand families: at what time the people were very ciuill, and had such plentie and magnificence of all things, that many would not sticke to compare this towne with the citie of Maroco. It had on all sides most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gardens, and great store of vines, whereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> grew vpon the mountaine it selfe, and others on the valley. By the foote of this hill runneth a faire riuer, which springing foorth of Atlas, falleth at length into Tensift. The field which lieth neere vnto this riuer is said to be so fruitfull, that it yeeldeth euery yeere fiftie fold encrease. The water of this riuer looketh alwaies white; albeit if a man stedfastly be∣hold the said riuer, it may seeme vnto him in colour to resemble the soile of Narnia, or the riuer Niger of Vmbria in Italie. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there are which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ariuer run∣ning vnder the ground to Maroco.</NOTE> affirme, that the very same riuer runneth vnder ground to Maroco, and not to breake foorth of the earth, till it come to a certaine place very neere vnto the said citie. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> princes in times past, being desirous to know the hidden and intricate passages of the said riuer, sent certaine persons into the hollow caue, who the better to discerne the same, carried candles and torches with them. But hauing proceeded a little way vnder ground, there met them such a flaw of winde, that blew out their lights, and perforce draue them backe to the great hazard of their liues, so that they said they neuer felt the like. They affirme likewise, that, the riuer being full of rocks, which the water driueth to and fro, and by reason of the manifold chanels and streames, their passage was altogether hindred. Wherefore that secret remaineth vnknowne euen till this day, neither is there any man so hardie as to attempt the same enterprise againe. I remember that I read in some histories, that king <HI>Ioseph</HI> which built Maroco, being forewarned by the coniecture of a certaine astrologer, that the whole region should perpetually be vexed with warre, prouided by arte-magique, that the passage of this riuer should alwaies bee vnknowen: least, if any enimie should afterward practise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he might cut off the course thereof from the saide citie. Neere vnto this riuer lies the common high way, which crosseth ouer mount Atlas to Guzula are∣gion<NOTE PLACE="marg">The desolation of Agmet.</NOTE> of Maroco. Howbeit the citie of Agmet, which I haue now described vnto you. hath at this day no other inhabitants but woolues, foxes, deere, and such other wilde beasts.

From the said towne the riuer of Agmet is almost fifteene miles distant: and the fielde lying betweene the saide riuer and towne is a most fruitefull soile, like vnto the fielde adioining vpon the citie of Agmet before mentioned. All the region betweene Maroco and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> foresaid riuer is in subiection vnto the gouernour of Maroco, but from the riuer vnto Hannimei the townes-men of Hannimei beare rule. This towne had a famous yoong captaine, who maintained continuall warre against the gouernor of Maroco, and somtimes against the Arabians also. He had like∣wise a most ample dominion vpon the mountaines of Atlas: by naturall disposition he was right liberal &amp; valiant, and hauing scarce attained to sixe∣teene yeeres of age, he slue his owne vncle, and vsurped his gouernment. Whereof so soone as the Arabians had intelligence, ioining three hundreth Christian horsemen, which came out of Portugale, vnto their great forces, they marched on the sodaine euen to the very gates of the towne. And the foresaide captaine with his armie containing scarce an hundreth horsemen, with a very fewe footemen met the Arabians, and gaue them such a valiant onset, that the greater part of them was slaine, and the Christians were so discomfited, that (as I suppose) not one of them returned home into Por∣tugale: which (they say) came to passe, both by reason that the Christians were ignorant of the place, and vnskilfull of the Africans manner of war∣fare. These things were done in the 920. yeere of the Hegeira, and in the yeere of our Lorde 1511. Afterward being wearied by the king of Fez his warres (which king demaunded tribute of the townes men of Hannimei) he was slaine with a bullet: whereupon the towne remained tributarie to the king of Fez. Yea, the deceased captaines wife deliuered as prisoners certaine burgesses of the towne vnto the king himselfe. And the king so soone as he had placed a lieutenant ouer Hannimei, departed from the same towne in the 921. yeere of the Hegeira, and in the yeere of our Lord 1512.</P>

<HEAD>Of the mountaine of Nififa.</HEAD>
<P>HAuing before described all the cities and townes of Maroco, it now remaineth that we briefly declare the situation and qualitie of the mountaines there. Wherefore we will begin with the mountaine of Nififa, from whence the region of Maroco it selfe beginneth westward, and is thereby diuided from the prouince of Hea. The said mountaine hath great store of inhabi∣tants: and albeit the tops thereof are continually couered with snowe; yet doth it yeerely affoorde marueilous increase and abundance of barley. The rude people there are so destitute of all humanitie and ciuill behauiour, that they do admire not onely all strangers, but also do euen gaze and woonder at their apparell. I my selfe remained two daies among them, in which space all the people of the towne came flocking about me, greatly woondring at the white garment which I wore (being such as the learned men of our coun∣trey are vsually clad in) so that euery one being desirous to handle and view this garment of mine, in two daies it was turned from white to blacke, and became all greasie and filthie. Here one of the townes-men being allured with the strangenes and noueltie of my sworde, which I bought at Fez for halfe a ducate, woulde neuer leaue intreating of me, till I had exchanged it with him for an horse, which cost (as himselfe affirmed) aboue ten ducates. The reason of which fonde and childish behauiour I thinke to be, because they neuer trauaile vnto Fez nor to any other cities. And were they neuer so desirous to trauaile, yet dare they not aduenture vpon the common high waies, in regard of the great number of robbers and theeues. Of honie, goates, and oile Arganick they haue woonderfull store: for in this moun∣taine beginneth the saide oile to be put in vse.</P>

<HEAD>Of the mountaine called Semede.</HEAD>
<P>AT the bounds of Nififa a certaine other mountaine called by the inhabitants Semede taketh his originall: and these two mountaines are separated by the riuer of Sefsaua. Semede extendeth eastward almost 20. miles, the inhabitants where∣of are most base &amp; witlesse people. Great store of springs &amp; fountaines are here to be found; the snowe is perpetuall; all good lawes, ciuilitie, and honestie are quite banished from hence, except perhaps the people be mooued thereunto by the aduise of some stranger, whom they finde to be of a modest and sober disposition. Here being entertained by a certaine religious man of the same place (who was had in great reputation by the people) I was constrained to eate of such grosse meats as the saide people are accustomed vnto, to wit, of barlie meale mingled with water, and of goats-flesh, which was extremely tough and hard by reason of the stale∣nes
<PB N="77" REF="75"/>
and long continuance. After supper we had no other bed but the bare ground to lie vpon. The next morning being ready to take horse, and desi∣rous to depart, fiftie of the people came about me, laying open each man their causes and suites vnto me, as our people vse to doe before a iudge. Vn∣to whom I answered, that I had neuer in all my life either knowen or heard of the manners and customes of that region. Foorthwith comes one of the chiefe men amongst them, affirming that it was their custome neuer to dismisse any stranger, till he had both heard and throughly decided all the quarrels and controuersies of the inhabitants. Which words he had no soo∣ner<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn Leo con∣strained to play the iudge.</NOTE> vttered, but immediately my horse was taken from me. Wherefore I was constrained for nine daies, and so many nights, longer to abide the penurie and miserie of that region. Moreouer my trouble was the greater, for that, in such abundance of suites and affaires, there was not one man present, which could set downe so much as a word in writing: wherefore I my selfe was faine to play both the iudge and the notarie. Vpon the eight day they all of them promised to bestowe some great rewarde vpon me. Wherefore the night following seemed vnto me a yeere long: for I was in good hope the next morrow to haue receiued a masse of golde from my clients. So soone as the next day began to dawne, they placed me in a certaine church∣porch: whither, after an vsuall and short praier ended, each man full reue∣rently presented his gift vnto me. Here some offered me a cocke, others brought me nuts and onions, and some others bestowed a handfull of gar∣licke vpon me. The principall and head-men amongst them presented me with a goat; and so by reason that there was no money in all the said moun∣taine, they proffered me not one farthing for my paines: wherefore all the said gifts I bequeathed vnto mine oste for his woorthie entertaining of me. And this was all the notable reward which I reaped in regarde of so great and intolerable paines. All things being thus dispatched, they sent fiftie horsemen to accompanie and guard me from theeues in that dangerous way.</P>

Their victuals consist of barlie, ho∣nie, and goates-flesh. In the same mountaine great multitudes of Iewes ex∣ercising handy-craftes, doe inhabite: likewise they make sope, yron-hookes, and horse-shooes. Diuers masons are here to be found also. They build their walles of no other matter but onely of rough stone and lime, and the roofes

They haue among them also abundance of learned men &amp; of skilful lawyers, whose counsell they vse at all times.

Heere likewise standeth a most strong and impregnable castle subiect vnto a certaine nobleman, which is reported to be of alliance vnto the prince of Maroco: howbeit they are at continuall warre for certaine landes situate within their dominions. Many Iewes exercising diuers handie-crafts doe here inhabite, and do yeerely pay vnto the gouernour of this mountaine great summes of money. As concerning religion, they follow them espe∣cially which are called Carrain. The top of this mountaine is continually couered with snow. When I first beheld this mountaine, I thought it had bin clouds; so great is the height therof. The sides of this mountaine being altogether destitute of herbes and trees, are in many places stored with ex∣cellent white marble, which the people might dig, and make a good com∣moditie thereof, were they not so sluggish and so ignorant in hewing and polishing of the fame. In this place are many pillars and arches which were most artificially and sumptuously built by those mightie princes whom we haue often before made mention of: which pillers they would haue vsed for the building of water-conduits, had they not beene hindred by the violence of warres. To be briefe, in the said mountaine I saw many notable things, whereof I will here make no discourse at all, partly because they are out of my remembrance, and partly for auoiding tediousnes to the reader; because I haue determined to passe ouer these small matters, and to proceede vnto greater.</P>

<P>THis region is exceding populous: westward it abutteth vpon Ilda a mountaine of Sus; northward it ioineth vnto Atlas, and eastward it stretcheth vnto the region of Hea. It is in∣habited with sauage and fierce people, beeing most needie of money, and yet abounding greatly in cattell. Great store of copper and yron is here digged out of mines, and here are brasen<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and cop∣per <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> vessels made, which are carried into other countries to be solde: and these vessels they exchange for linnen and woollen cloth, for horses, and for other wares necessarie for the said region. In all this whole region there is neither towne nor castle enuironed with walles. Great villages they haue, which con∣taine, many of them, more then a thousand families a peece. They haue nei∣ther king nor gouernour to prescribe any lawes vnto them: but euerie one is his owne captaine and commander; whereupon they are at continuall warres among themselues, neither haue they any truce at all, but three daies<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wars <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>.</NOTE> onely euery weeke; during which time euery man may safely and freely bar∣gaine with his enemie, and may trauell whither he listeth. But these daies of truce being past, the wretched people of this region do continually commit most horrible slaughters.

all which time (though the number of merchants be neuer so great) they giue<NOTE PLACE="marg">Free entertain∣ment for mer∣chants.</NOTE> free entertainment vnto all such as either bring wares with them, or come thither to fetch away their wares. When the time of their faire approcheth, they foorthwith make truce, and each faction appointeth a captaine ouer an hundred soldiers, to the end they may keepe themselues in safetie, and may defend their said faire from the inuasion and iniurie of all lewd persons. If any offence be committed, the captaines immediately giue sentence vpon the guiltie person: and whosoeuer bee conuicted of theft, is foorthwith slaine like a brute beast, and his theeues carcase is throwne out to be deuou∣red of dogs, wilde beastes, and rauenous foules. The saide faire is kept in a certaine plaine or valley betweene two hils. All the wares are contained in tents and in certaine cottages made of boughes, so that each particular kind of merchandize hath a seuerall place to lie in by it selfe. They which sell droues of cattell are remooued farre from the tents. And euery tent hath a cottage made of boughes belonging thereunto, for their principal and head men to repose themselues in. And in the said cottages or bowers are mer∣chant strangers (as we noted before) freely entertained and bourded. Also they haue certaine Caters &amp; purueiers among them, which make prouision of victuals, and take vpon them the friendly and well entertaining of stran∣gers. And albeit an huge deale of money is spent for this behalfe, yet make they a good gaine thereof: for thither doe resort all the merchants of that region for traffiques sake, yea and a great number out of the land of Negros, who bring with them maruellous plentie of all kindes of wares.

<HEAD>Of the towne of Azaphi.</HEAD>
<P>IT was built by the Africans, and standeth vpon the shore of the Ocean sea, containing fower thousand families: inhabi∣tants there are great store, being for the most part very vnci∣uill and barbarous. In times past there dwelt many Iewes in this towne, which exercised diuers handy-crafts. Their soile is exceeding fertill; but so grosse is their owne vnskilfulnes and negligence, that they know neither how to till their ground, to sow their corne, or to plant vineyards: except perhaps some few of them (who would seeme to be more prouident then the residue) sow a quantitie of pot-herbes in their smal gardens. After the kings of Maroco gaue ouer the gouerment of the saide region, the citie of Azafi was vsurped by certaine which were said to fetch their originall from Farchon. Howbeit in our daies the said citie was gouer∣ned by a certaine prince called Hebdurrahmam: this man for a greedy and ambitious desire of raigning murthered his owne vncle: after whose death he gouerned the towne for certaine yeeres. He had a daughter of most ex∣cellent beauty, who falling in loue with a certaine courtier (whose name was <HI>Hali,</HI> being sonne vnto one <HI>Goesimen</HI>) by the helpe of her mother and her wayting maide enioyed oftentimes the companie of her paramour. Which when her father had intelligence of, hee rebuked his wife, threatening death vnto her, if shee reformed not the manners of her daughter: howbeit afterwarde hee dissembled his furie. But the mother through∣ly knowing her husbandes intent, tolde her daughters paramour that the prince was not to bee trusted, and therefore aduised him to take heede vnto himselfe. Whereupon <HI>Hali</HI> fearing least some mischiefe might light vpon him, began to determine with himselfe the princes death, and for<NOTE PLACE="marg">The occasion of the prince of Azafilin his death.</NOTE> his associate in this conspiracie he tooke a trusty friend of his who had been most familiar with him from his childhoode, and was captaine ouer a cer∣taine band of footemen. Wherefore both of them being alike mischieuous∣ly bent against their prince, expected nothing else but a fit place and opor∣tunitie to put their bloudie determination in practise. Contrariwise the king seeking by all meanes an occasion to effect his purpose, sent word vnto <HI>Hali</HI> vpon a certaine festiuall day, that after their Mahumetan deuotions were finished he shoulde come and walke with him; appointing a place, where he had laide a troupe of men in ambush to kill <HI>Hali</HI> at his comming: which being done, he went to church. <HI>Hali</HI> suspecting no harme at all, told his associate, that now was the time wherein they might bring their purpose to effect. And this intent of theirs they foorthwith declared vnto ten other of their adherents: and to the end that the whole matter might go securely and certainly forward, they presently assembled a great multitude of foote∣men (which they fained that they woulde sende the next day vnto Aza∣mor) that, if they were constrained to flie, they might haue aide and suc∣cour
<PB N="83" REF="78"/>
in a readines. All their complices being armed, they came to church at the very same time when as the king with all his traine was entring there∣into, and had placed himselfe next vnto the Mahumetan preacher. The church was full of auditors, and the king had his guard attending vpon him, who bicause they knew the two foresaid yoong gentlemen to be very fami∣liar with the king, suspected none euill, but suffered them to draw neere vnto his person. Wherefore one of the saide yoong courtiers, as though he<NOTE PLACE="marg">The prince of Azafi slaine, as he was hearing of a Mahume∣tan sermon.</NOTE> would haue done obeizance vnto the king, came before him, but <HI>Hali</HI> got in at his backe and stabd him through with a dagger: and at the verie same instant the other thrust him in with his sworde, and so this vnhappie king, imbrued in his owne bloud, gaue vp the ghost. The kings guarde went about to apprehend the authors of this fact; but being ouermatched by the contrarie part, and suspecting, least the people were authors of this conspi∣racie, they sought to saue themselues by flight. And after them followed all the rest of the assemblie, till the authors of the saide murther were left alone. They also immediately came foorth, and perswaded the people with many words, that they had slaine the king for none other cause, but onely in regard that he had attempted the vtter ouerthrow both of themselues and of the whole people. The citizens beeing to too credulous, aduaunced the two foresaid conspiratours to the gouernment of the kingdome: howbeit they agreed not long thereabout, but the common-wealth was diuersly tos∣sed hither and thither, sometime inclining to one, &amp; sometime to another. Wherefore the Portugall merchants which vsually frequented that citie in great numbers, wrote vnto their king to sende foorthwith an armie of soldi∣ers thither: for they were in good hope, that he shoulde most easily and with small disaduantage winne the saide citie. Howbeit the king being no∣thing mooued with this message of theirs, would not send any forces at al, til he was more certainly informed by his said merchants touching the death of the king of Azaphi, &amp; the dissension betweene the two new gouernours. As also, that they had made such a compact with a certaine captaine of the con∣trary faction, that it was the easiest matter in the world for him to cōquer the towne. For they had built them a verie strong castell vpon the sea-shore, wherein their merchandize might safely be bestowed. For the Portugals had perswaded the townes-men, that during the great tumult about the kings death, they were all of them in danger to lose both their liues and goods. Wherefore into this castell, among their vessels of oile and other wares, they cunningly conueied gunnes and all other kind of warlike instruments: but the townes-men being ignorant heere of, exacted nothing of the Portu∣gals saue onely custome due for their wares. Now after the Portugales had sufficiently prouided themselues of all kinde of armour and warlike muniti∣ons, they sought by all meanes an occasion to fight with the citizens. At length it came to passe that a certaine Portugals seruant buying meat in the citie, did so prouoke a butcher, that after much quarrelling they fell to blowes, whereupon the seruant feeling himselfe hurt, thrust the butcher
<PB N="84" REF="79"/>
with his sworde, and laide him along vpon the colde earth, and then fledde speedily to the castell, wherein he knewe the merchants to be. The people immediately rose vp in armes, and ranne all of them with one consent vn∣to the castell, to the end they might vtterly destroy it, &amp; cut the throats of all them which were therein. But the guns and crosse-bowes which were there in a readines made such hauock among the townes-men, that it cannot be, but they were greatly daunted. At this first encounter there were an hūdreth and fiftie citizens slaine outright; howbeit the residue woulde not therefore giue ouer, but gaue the castle daily assaults. At length the king of Portugall sent aide vnto his subiects, to wit fiue thousand footemen, two hundreth horsemen, with a great number of gunnes. Which forces when the citi∣zens sawe to approch, they presently betooke themselues to their feete, and fled vnto the mountaine of Benimegher: neither durst any man staie in the towne, but onely he that was the author of building the castle. And so it<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> woon by the Portugals.</NOTE> came to passe that the Portugall forces woon the towne without any perill or labour. Soone after the generall of the whole armie sent the builder of the castle vnto the king of Portugall. But the king sent him with a cer∣taine number of attendants backe againe to Azafi, and appointed him go∣uernour of all the region adiacent. For the Portugall king was not acquain∣ted with their customes, nether did he sufficiently know how they gouerned their common-wealth. Soone after ensued the miserable desolation and ruine, not onely of the citie but of the whole region thereabouts. In this dis∣course we haue beene somewhat tedious, to the end we might shew of how great euill a woman may be the instrument, and what intollerable mis∣chiefes are bred by dissension.

Pulse and corne they haue great plentie; though their gardens and orchards bring foorth nought else but figs. They haue such plentie of fishes, that they receiue yeerely for them sometime sixe thousand, and sometime seuen thousand duckats. And their time of fishing dureth from October to the end of Aprill. They vse to frie fishes in a certaine pan with oile, whereby they gather an incredible quantitie of trane: neither vse they any other oile to put into their lampes. Once a yeere the Portugals make a voiage hither, and doe carrie away so great abundance of fish, that they onely doe disburse the summe of duckats aforesaid. Hence it is, that the king of Portugal, being allured for gaine, hath often sent most warlike fleetes to surprise this towne: the first whereof, in regarde of the Generals indiscretion, was the greatest part dispersed and sunke vpon the sea. Afterward the king sent another nauie of two hundred saile well furnished, at the very sight whereof the citizens were so discomfi∣ted, that they all betooke themselues to flight; and the throng was so great at their entrance of the gates, that moe then fowerscore citizens were slaine therein.

This mountaine is so exceeding fruitful for oile and corne, that a man would scarce beleeue it. It was once in subiection vnto the prince of Azafi, but the inhabitants of Azafi being put to flight, as hath beene aforesaid, had no other place for their refuge, but onely this mountaine of Benimegher. Af∣terward they paid tribute for certaine yeeres vnto the Portugals; but when the king of Fez came thither with his army, he caried with him part of them vnto Fez, and the residue returned to Azafi: for they were determined ra∣ther to indure any iniurie, then to submit themselues to the Christians go∣uernment.</P>

<HEAD>Of the greene mountaine.</HEAD>
<P>THis mountaine is of an exceeding height, beginning eastward from the riuer of Ommirabih, and extending westward to the hils called in their language Hasara, and it diuideth Duccala from some part of Tedles. Likewise this mountaine is very rough and full of woods, affoording great<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fruit called by the Italians Frutto Afri∣cano.</NOTE> store of acornes and pine-apples, and a certaine kinde of red fruit which the Italians commonly call Africano. Many Hermites also doe inhabite vpon this mountaine, liuing with no other kind of victuals, but such as the woods yeeld vnto them. For they are aboue fiue and twenty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> distant from all townes and cities. Here are great store of fountaines and of altars built after the Mahumetan fashion, and many auncient houses also erected by the Africans. At the foot of this mountaine there is a notable lake, very like vnto the lake of Bolsena in the Roman territorie. In which lake are found infinite numbers of fishes, as namely eeles, pickrels, and of diuers other sorts, which, to my remembrance, I neuer saw in Italie: but there is no man that goeth about to take any fish in this lake, no maruell therefore though the number be so great. Vpon a certaine time when Mahumet the king of Fez trauelled<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great plentic of fish.</NOTE> that way towards the kingdome of Maroco, he encamped his armie eight daies vpon the side of this lake. Some of his companie he licenced to fish the same, amongst whom I saw certaine that tooke off their shirts and coats, sowing vp their sleeues and collars, and putting certaine hoops within them to keepe them from closing together, and so vsed them in steed of nets, wherewith notwithstanding they caught many thousand fishes: but others which had nets indeed, got more then they. And all by reason that the fishes (as we will now declare) were perforce driuen into the nets. For king Mahu∣met being there accompanied with fourteene thousand Arabian horsemen, which brought a great many more camels with them; and hauing fiue thou∣sand horsemen vnder the conduct of his brother, with an huge armie of fooremen, caused them all at once to enter the lake, insomuch that there
<PB N="90" REF="82"/>
was scarce water ynough to satisfie the camels thirst: wherefore it was no maruell though the fishes came so fast into the nets. Vpon the banks of this lake are many trees bearing leaues like vnto pine-leaues, among the boughes whereof, such abundance of turtles doe nestle, that the inhabitants reape woonderfull commoditie by them. Mahumet hauing refreshed himselfe eight daies by the foresaid lake, was then desirous to view The greene moun∣taine aforesaid: my selfe with a great number of courtiers and learned men attending vpon him. So often as he saw any altar, he would command his armie there to make a stand, and lowly kneeling on his knees, would say these words following: <Q>Thou knowest (oh Lord my God) that I came hither for none other cause, but to release the people of Duccala from the Arabians and cruell Christians: which attempt of mine if thou thinkest to be vniust, let me onely feele the punishment of this offence: for these my followers are guiltlesse.</Q> And thus we ranged vp and downe the greene hill one whole day: but at night we returned vnto our tents. The next day it was king Ma∣humets pleasure to goe on hunting and hauking, whereupon his hounds and haukes (which he had in great abundance) were brought foorth: howbeit that sport yeelded nought but wilde geese, duckes, turtle-doues, and other fowles. But the day following the king called for his hounds, faulcons, and eagles: their game were hares, deere, porcupikes, roe-deere, woolues, quailes and starlings: and by reason that none had hunted or hawked there an hun∣dred yeeres before, they had very good pastime. And after we had here stai∣ed certaine daies, the king with his armie marching vnto the said Elmadin a towne of Duccala, willed all his learned men and priestes which hee had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn Leo sent ambassadour from the King of Fez vnto Maroco.</NOTE> brought with him, to returne vnto Fez. But my selfe (as ambassadour) and a certaine number of soldiers he sent vnto Maroco: this was done in the 922. yeere of the Hegeira, and in the yeere of our Lord 1512.</P>

<P>THis region is bounded northward with certaine mountaines which adioine vpon Duccala; westward with a riuer running by the foote of mount Hadimmei, which we called before Tensift; and eastward by the riuer Quadelhabid, that is, the riuer of seruants, which riuer diuideth Hascora from Tedles. And so likewise the hils of Duccala doe separate Hascora from the Ocean sea. The inhabitants of this region are far more ciuil, then the people of Duccala. This prouince yeeldeth great abundance of oyle, of Marockin skinnes, and of goates, of whose haire they make cloath and sadles. And hither do all the bordering regions bring their goat-skins, whereof the foresaid Marockin or Cordouan leather is made. This people hath great traffique with the Portugals, with whom they exchange the fore∣said leather and sadles, for cloath. Their coine is all one with the coine of Duccala.

<HEAD>Of Elmadin a towne in Hascora.</HEAD>
<P>THis towne of Hascora being called by the inhabitants Elma∣din, is built vpon the side of mount Atlas, and containeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then two thousand families. It standeth almost fourescore and ten miles eastward of Maroco, and about 60. miles from Duc∣cala. Heere may you finde many leather-dressers, and all other kinde of artizans, with a great multitude of Iewish merchants. This towne is enuironed with a certaine wood, which is full of oliue, and walnut-trees. The inhabitants are continually, in a manner, oppressed with warres among themselues, and against a certaine little towne beeing fower miles distant from thence. Neither dare any come vpon the plaine lying betweene these two townes, (saue women onely and slaues) except he be well and strongly guarded. So that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man is faine to maintaine an harquebusier or ar∣cher for his defence, whom he monethlyalloweth ten or twelue pieces of gold, which are woorth sixeteene ducates Italian. Likewise in Elmadin there are certaine men of great and profound learning, which are appointed to be iudges and notaries. Whatsoeuer tribute or custome strangers doe pay, is deliuered vnto certaine treasurers and customers of the towne; which imploy it afterward for the publike benefite. They are likewise constrained to pay certaine tribute vnto the Arabians, for sundrie possessions which they enioy in the foresaide valley; but that money gaineth them at the A∣rabians hand ten times so much, or more. In my returne from Maroco I thought good to trauell by this towne, where I was right sumptuously en∣tertained by one of Granada my countrey-man, who was exceeding rich, ha∣uing serued as an archer in this region for fifteene yeeres. And albeit the towne of Elmadin had a stately hospitall, wherein all merchants trauelling that way, were entertained at the common charge; yet my countrey-man would not suffer vs there to lodge, but for three daies together most curte∣ously welcommed my selfe, nine courtiers, and all the seruants and retinue which we brought with vs: vnto which companie of ours the townesmen presented, some of them calues, some lambes, and some other brought hens. Seeing vpon a time so many goates in the towne, I merily demaunded of my countrey-man, why he gaue vs no kids-flesh to eate: hee answered that that was accounted among them of all others the most base and homely meate. Their faire and beautifull women are so fonde of strangers that if secret occasion be offered they will not refuse their dishonest com∣panie.</P>

The inhabitants are merchants, ar∣tizans, and gentlemen, &amp; families it containeth to the num∣ber of one thousand. This towne hath been at continuall war with the towne last before mentioned: but in our time both of them were by the meanes of a certaine merchant brought in subiection vnto the King of Fez, as we will now declare. There was a merchant of Fez which had a paramour in this<NOTE PLACE="marg">By what means the townes of Elmadin and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be∣came subiect vnto the King of Fez.</NOTE> towne, whom he determined foorthwith to marrie; but when the marriage day was come, this merchant was beguiled of his loue by the gouernour of the towne himselfe, which disappointment grieued him full sore, albeit he dissembled the matter as well as he could. Returning home to the King of Fez, the said merchant presented vnto him most rich and costly gifts, ma∣king humble suite vnto his maiestie that hee would allow him an hundred principall archers, three hundred horsemen, and fower hundred footemen; saying, that himselfe would maintaine them all at his owne costs and char∣ges, and would winne the said towne of Alemdin for the Kings behalfe, and would assure the King seuen thousand ducates for yeerely tribute. This offer pleased the King right well, and that he might declare his princely liberali∣tie, he would not suffer the merchant to giue wages vnto any, but onely to the archers. And so with all expedition he commanded his gouernour of Tedles to prouide the saide merchant so many horsemen and so many foot∣men, and two captaines ouer the armie. At length comming before Alem∣din they besiged it sixe daies: which being expired, the townesmen told their gouernour in plaine termes, that they would not for his cause incur the king of Fez his displeasure, nor suffer any inconuenience. Whereupon he put∣ting himselfe in a beggers weede, attempted to escape away: but being kno∣wen and apprehended, he was brought before the merchant, who commit∣ted him to prison. And so the townesmen presently opening their gates receiued the merchant with all his troupes, &amp; yeelded themselues to him &amp; to the king of Fez. The parents of the foresaid maid protested vnto the mer∣chant', that the gouernour by maine force had depriued them of his para∣mour. Howbeit she herselfe was big with childe by the gouernour; but af∣ter the merchant knew that she was deliuered of her childe, he bore her af∣fection againe, and at length married her. And the wretched gouernour was the same day by the iudges pronounced guiltie of fornication, and was stoned to death. Well, the merchant remained gouernour and Lord of both townes, establishing most firme peace between them, &amp; duely paying vnto the king of Fez all the yeerly tribute which he had promised. I my selfe afterward comming to the foresaide towne grew familiarly acquainted with

Their vines dispersing themselues vpon the boughes of trees doe make most pleasant bowers and walkes: the grapes whereof being red, are for their bignes, called in the language of that people, hennes egs. They haue here<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grapes of mar∣uellous bignes. White honey.</NOTE> great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of oile and most excellent honie: some of their honie be∣ing white, and some yellow. This towne hath many fountaines about it, which ioyning into one streame, do serue for many water-mils thereabouts. Here are likewise great store of artizans, who exercise themselues onely about things necessarie. The inhabitants are somewhat ciuill, their women are most beautifull, being most gorgeously decked with siluer iewels. Their oile they carrie vnto the next cities southward of them on this side Atlas: but they send their leather vnto Fez and Mecnasa. Their plaine is almost sixe miles long: the soile being most fruitfull for corne: in regard whereof the townes-men pay certaine yeerely tribute vnto the Arabiaus. This towne hath iudges, priestes, and a great number of gentlemen. Vpon a time as I trauelled this way, it was my hap to meete with a certaine ancient gouernour of the same place, who was growne blinde with extreme age. This aged sire (as by some I vnderstood) was in his youth a most valiant and stout person, insomuch that after many other noble exploits, he slew with his owne hand fower captaines which were most deadly enemies vnto the people of Tago∣dast. And afterward he handled the matter so wisely, that he ioyned those in perfect league which before time had waged continual warre. Here no com∣monwealth-matter is concluded by the magistrates of the towne without his speciall aduise and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. By this worthie Senatour my selfe with fower∣score <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were honorably entertained, and had dainty meates euery day set before vs, of game which was newly hunted. He recounted most fa∣miliarly vnto vs all his labours which he had bestowed in concluding of the forefaid league: neither had this good man any so entire and hidden secrets, which he reuealed not vnto vs, as to his louing friends. At my departure I offered him money for my selfe and my companie: but he, like a liberall man, would by no meanes accept of it; saying, that albeit he ought the king of Fez much dutie and good will, yet did he not bestowe that liberalitie for his sake: but that whatsoeuer wealth he enioied, his parents bequeathed vnto him vpon this condition, that he should shew himselfe kinde and bountifull vnto all his kinred, acquaintance, and strangers trauelling that way: and although he were free from that condition, yet his loue towards God, and
<PB N="94" REF="84"/>
the liberalitie which God had planted in him, could require no lesse at his hands. Yea, he said, that by Gods good blessing and prouidence he had rea∣ped the same yeere seuen thousand bushels of corne: insomuch, that him∣selfe and all his neighbours were prouided for in abundance. Moreouer, that he possessed of sheepe and goates moe then an hundred thousand, the wooll whereof only, and some small portion of butter, he reserued to himselfe, but as for the cheese and milke, he gaue it all frankly vnto his shepherds. In this towne there is none that selleth either cheese, butter, milk, or any otber such commoditie, though each one hath great abundance of cattell. Howbeit their hides, oile, and wooll they vtter in the prouinces thereabout. The re∣uerend sire added this moreouer: If it shall please (saith he) the king of Fez to returne home from Duccala through this my region, I will come foorth to meete him, and will submit my selfe wholly vnto him, as vnto my most liege and soueraigne prince. Thus my selfe a meere stranger being so hono∣rably dismissed by this woorthie Senatour, could not sufficiently commend his courtesie and bounteous dealing towards strangers.</P>

Here are innumerable springs and fountaines, and most pleasant and fruitfull gardens in all places. Here are likewise walnut-trees huge and tall.

And whatsoeuer commoditie proceedeth of their labour, they car∣rie it to forren regions where they thinke it is wanting: from whence they bring home slaues, woad, and the skins of certaine beastes, whereof they make most defensiue and warlike shields: these shields they transport vnto Fez, exchanging them there for weapons, cloth, and other such things as they stand in neede of. This towne standeth so neere vnto the high way, that the boyes wil stand gazing and woondering at merchants as they come by, especially if they weare any strange attire. The residue of inhabitants vp∣on this mountaine are all commanded and gouerned by them of the towne. They say that the people of Tagodast aforesaid were the first founders of this towne: for so vpon a time it befell, that whereas the principall men of Tagodast grew to dissension among themselues, the common sort fauou∣ring neither faction, built Elgiumuha, and left Tagodast to be inhabited by their gouernours: hence it is, that euen at this day they are here onely igno∣ble and base people, whereas there they are all gentlemen.</P>

<P>THis mountaine is situate ouer against Hascora vpon that part of At∣las which trendeth southward.

It yeeldeth abundance of woad &amp; barlie: but other graine they haue none at all, so that they haue no other but barlie bread to eate. At all times of the yeere you shal here see plenty of snow. Here are likewise sundry noblemē &amp; gentlemen, all which are subiect vnto one prince.

Comming my selfe to see this mountaine, it was my chaunce to finde out the saide prince, who was desirous exceedingly to be praised of all men: but for liberalitie, curtesie, and ciuilitie, his like I thinke was not to be founde.

letters vnto the prince of Dara, requesting him that he woulde perswade mine vncle to trauaile vnto Tombuto by mount Tenueues: for he had a great desire to see him, &amp; to speake with him. Howbeit my vncle answered, that it beseemed not a kings ambassadour to visite any princes farre out of his way, and so to deferre his masters waightie affaires. But, to the end that he might in some sort satisfie the saide prince, he promised to sende me his nephew vnto him, which might in his name salute him and do him due ho∣nour. Afterward he deliuered me certaine costlie gifts to present the prince withall: as namely a curious paire of stirrups double gilt and finely wrought after the Morisco fashion, which cost (as I remember) fiue and twentie ducates; and a rich paire of spurs of fifteene ducates price. More∣ouer he sent two bands of silke artificially entwined with gold, one whereos was tawnie, and the other blew. He sent also a most excellent booke, con∣taining the liues of certaine famous and deuout men of Africa, togither with certaine verses in the commendation of the prince himselfe. Thus be∣ing furnished with the things aforesaid, I set foorth on my iourney, taking two horsemen to accompanie me vnto the foresaid mountaine: and so as I road, I inuented verses in the princes praise. At our first arriuall there, the prince with a great traine of his nobilitie was ridden foorth on hunting. Who being enformed of my comming, caused me foorthwith to be sent for, and after salutations had, he asked me how my vncle did: I answered that he was in good health, and at his highnes disposition. Then he commanded me to be carried vnto a stately lodging, where, after my tedious iourney, I might repose my selfe, till he were returned from hunting. And so within night returning from his game, he sent for me immediately to come into his chamber of presence: where, hauing first performed due obeisance vnto him, I presented him with mine vncles gifts: which (as I suppose) were most acceptable vnto him. At length I gaue him the verses which mine vncle had indited: which he presently commanded one of his secretaries to read. And as he was expounding each sentence and worde vnto the prince, it was a woonder to see, what exceeding alacritie and ioy appeered in his counte∣naunce. The verses being read, he sate downe to supper, willing me not one∣ly to be his guest, but also to sit next vnto his person. His table was furni∣shed with mutton, veale rosted and sodden, and with bread baked like a cake. Diuers other dishes likewise were serued in, but I remember not all the par∣ticulars. Supper being ended, I greeted the prince in this wise: Your high∣nes (my lord) hath receiued all those gifts, which your humble seruant mine vncle (in token of his loiall disposition, and that he might be had of your highnes in remembrance) hath sent you: Now I being both his sisters sonne and his scholler, haue nought else but a fewe wordes to present your princelines withall: may it please you therefore to accept of such homely<NOTE PLACE="marg">The excellent wit &amp; toward∣linesse of Iohn Leo at 16. yeers of age.</NOTE> stuffe as my witte could sodainly affoord in the time of my iourney.

But on me he bestowed fiftie ducates and a good horse; and to each of my two seruants he gaue ten ducates: giuing mine vncle to vnderstande, that his meane gift which he bestowed, was sent not in regard of his woorthy presents, but for a recompence of his excellent verses. For as touching mine vncles gifts, he saide he woulde deferre the requitall thereof till his returne from Tombuto, what time he would more fully manifest his good will towards him. Then commanding one of his secretaries to direct vs on our way, &amp; most courte∣ously bidding vs farewell; he told vs that the same day he was going to make an assault vpon his enimies.

<P>TEnsita is a part of Atlas, beginning westward from the mountaine last before mentioned, eastward extending to mount Dedes, and south∣ward bordering vpon the desert of Dara. This mountaine is well stored with inhabitants, hauing moe then fiftie castles about it, the wals whereof are built of lime and rough stone: and by reason of the southerly situation it is euer almost destitute of raine. All the said castles stand not far from the riuer of Dara, some being three, and some fower miles distant there from. The greatest prince in all this region hath vnder his command well nigh fif∣teene hundreth horsemen, and about so many footemen as the prince of Tenueues before named. And albeit these two princes are most neerely conioined in bloud, yet can neither of them refraine from most cruel wars against the other. It is a woonder to see, what plentie of dates this moun∣taine affoordeth: the inhabitants giue themselues partly to husbandry, and partly to traffike. Barly they haue in great abundance: but of other graine and of flesh their scarcitie is incredible: for that region hath no flockes nor droues at all. The prince of this mountaine commonly receiueth for yeer∣ly tribute twentie thousand peeces of golde: euery of which peeces con∣taineth not so much by one third part, as an Italian ducate. There hath alwaies beene so great amitie betweene the king of Fez and this prince, that either often sendeth rich gifts vnto other.

And those which now remaine there are most base, beggerly and slauish people: Howbeit they sell some quantitie of oyle and barley: neither indeed will their soyle affoorde any other commodities.

<HEAD>Of Tefza the principall towne in Tedles</HEAD>
<P>TEfza the chiefe towne of all Tedles, was built by the Africans vpon the side of mount Atlas, some fiue miles from the plaine. The towne wals are built of most excellent marble, which is called in their lan∣guage Tefza, and hereupon the towne was so called likewise. Heere doe reside most rich merchants of all sorts: of Iewes here are two hundred families, who ex∣ercise merchandise and diuers other trades. And here you shall finde many outlandish merchants which buy from hence certaine blacke mantles with hoods, commonly called <HI>Ilbernus:</HI> of these there are great numbers both in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ilbernus.</NOTE> Italy and Spaine. Neither are there in Fez any kinde of wares, which are not heere to be bought: if any merchant will exchange his wares for other, hee may the sooner be dispatched: for the townesmen are furnished with diuers kindes of merchandise, as namely with slaues, horses, woad, leather, and such like: whereas if the forreiners were desirous to sell their wares for ready mo∣ney, they should neuer attaine to the value of them. They haue golden coine without any image or superscription: their apparell is decent: and their women are beautifull and of good behauiour. In this towne are di∣uers Mahumetan temples, and many priests and iudges. Their common∣wealth was woont alwaies to be most prosperous and well-gouerned; but degenerating from better to woorse, they were afterward so turmoyled with dissensions and wars, that certaine being expelled hence, came vnto the king of Fez, humbly beseeching him that by force he would restore them to their natiue countrey, conditionally that all matters wel succeeding on their side, they should deliuer the towne vnto the king. This condition was accepted, and the king hauing a thousand braue horsemen readie to doe the feat, ioy∣ned fiue hundred horse, and two hundred gunners on horsebacke vnto
<PB N="100" REF="87"/>
them. Moreouer he wrote vnto certaine Arabians (which are commonly called <HI>Zuair,</HI> and haue almost fower thousand horesemen at commaund) that, if need so required, they would come in, and ayde his troupes. Ouer the saide armie the king appointed as captaine one <HI>Ezzeranghi,</HI> a most vali∣ant and redoubted warriour. Who hauing pitched his tents neere vnto the towne, began presently to giue the townesmen an assault. But when he had done his best, the warlike citizens easily gaue him the repulse. Moreouer the Arabians called Benigeber were comming with fiue thousand horsemen to succour the towne. Which so soone as Captaine <HI>Ezzeranghi</HI> was ad∣uertised of, he raised his siege, and went suddenly to meete with the foresaid Arabians; whom after he had discomfited in three daies, he then safely re∣turned to lay new siege. The citizens seeing themselues cut off from all hope of the Arabians ayde, began seriously to treat of peace with the ene∣mie; which the easlier to obtaine, they promised to defray all the kings charges layde out in this expedition, and to pay him for yeerly tribute moe then ten thousand ducates: howbeit with this prouiso, that they for whose cause the king had sent the said armie, if they entred the towne, should bee secluded from all Magistracie and gouernment. But they hearing of these conditions, spake vnto the Captaine in manner following: Sir, if it shall please you to restore vs vnto our former dignitie and state, we will procure you aboue an hundreth thousand ducates. Neither is there cause why any man should feare any iniurie or violence; for we protest vnto you that no man shall be a farthing endamaged by vs: onely we will exact at our aduer∣saries handes the reuenues of our possessions which they haue these three <UNCLEAR>yeeres</UNCLEAR> vniustly detained from vs. The summe whereof will amount vnto thirtie thousand ducates, all which we are most willing to bestow vpon you, in regard of those labours which you haue vndergone for our sakes. Moreo∣uer the reuenues of the whole region shall bee yours, which will come to twentie thousand ducates. And the Iewes tribute shall yeeld you ten thou∣sand more. Vpon these speeches the Captaine returned answere vnto the citizens, that his master the king of Fez had most faithfully promised those which mooued him vnto this warre, that he would neuer forsake them till they had attained their harts desire: for which cause he was more willing to haue them gouerne, then the townesmen which were now in possession, and that for many reasons: wherefore (saith he) if you be determined to yeelde vnto the king, assure your selues, that no inconuenience shall light vpon you: but if you will to the ende remaine peruerse and obstinate, be yee assu∣red also, that the king will deale most extremely with you. This message was no sooner knowen vnto the people, but foorthwith they began to be distra∣cted into diuers factions: some there were which stood for the king, and others chose rather manfully to fight it out, then that the king should be admitted: insomuch that the whole citie resounded with brawlings, quarels, and contentions. This tumult came at length by spies vnto the Captaines eare, who presently caused halfe his forces to take armes; and by their
<PB N="101" REF="87"/>
meanes in three howers space he wan the citie with little slaughter on his part. For those townesmen that fauoured the king, did what they could on the inside, to set open the gates, and so did the assailants on the outside, nei∣ther did any resist their attempts, by reason of the foresaid ciuill dissensions. Whereupon Captaine <HI>Ezzeranghi</HI> entring the citie, caused the kings co∣lours to be aduanced in the market-place, and vpon the wals, charging his horsemen to range about the citie, that no citizens might escape by flight; and last of all made a proclamation vnto all his souldiers, that they should not vpon paine of death offer any iniurie vnto the townesmen. Then he caused all the chieftaines of the contrarie faction to be brought prisoners vnto him: to whom he threatned captiuitie and thraldome, till they should disburse so much as the king had spent in that expedition: the totall summe was twelue thousand ducates, which the wiues and kinsfolkes of the captiues presently payde. Neither could they yet obtaine their libertie: for the ex∣iles, for whose cause the king had sent that armie, demaunded restitution of all their goods, which the other had for certaine yeeres detained from them. The captiues therfore were committed that night, &amp; the next morning law∣yers &amp; atturnies came to plead on both sides before a iudge &amp; the captaine. Howbeit after a great deale of tedious fending and proouing, hauing con∣cluded nothing at all, the captaine was so weary, that he left them, and went to supper. Afterward he caused the captiues to be brought foorth, wishing them to pay the sums demaunded; for (saith he) If you come before the king of Fez he wil make you to disburse more then twise the value. At which words being terrified, they wrote vnto their wiues, if they woulde euer see them aliue, to procure them money by some meanes. Eight daies after, the women brought as many golde rings, bracelets, and other such iewels, as were valued at eight and twenty thousand ducates: for they had rather be∣stowe these for the ransome of their husbandes, then to reueale their great wealth; bringing foorth all their costly ornaments, as if their money had beene quite exhaust. When therefore the king and the exiles were fully satisfied, insomuch that nothing seemed nowe to let the said captiues from libertie, the captaine spake vnto them in this wise: Sirs, I haue signified (though vnwillingly) vnto my master the king all matters which haue here passed betweene vs: for I dare by no meanes release you, till the kings letters authorize me so to do: Howbeit, I wish you to be of good cheere; for sithens you haue honestly restored to euery man his owne, there is no doubt but your selues shall shortly be set at libertie. The same night the cap∣taine<NOTE PLACE="marg">A notable and effectuall pra∣ctise to wring more money out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> purses.</NOTE> called a friend of his, whose counsell he founde oftentimes to take good effect, and asked him by what meanes he might without suspicion of guile or trechery, wring any more sums of money from them. Whereunto his friend replied: make them beleeue (quoth he) that you are willed by the kings letters to put them all to death: howbeit, that you will not, for pitties sake, deale so extremely with innocent persons: but that you will send them to Fez to receiue punishment or pardon at the kings pleasure. Heereupon
<PB N="102" REF="88"/>
the kings letters were counterfeited, which the day following the captaine with a lamētable voice published vnto his two &amp; forty prisoners. My friends (quoth he) so it is, that the king hauing receiued some sinister and wrong information, that you should go about to make a conspiracie: most firme∣ly enioineth me by these his letters, to put each one of you to death: which, though it be ful sore against my wil, yet needs I must obey my prince, if I wil not wittingly runne vpon mine owne destruction. And then shedding some fained teares: sithens (quoth he) we can vpon the sodaine deuise no better course, I thinke it most conuenient to send you with a troupe of horsemen vnto the king, whose wrath (perhaps) you may by some meanes pacifie. Whereupon the captiues growing farre more pensiue then before, recom∣mended themselues vnto God, and to the captaines clemencie, requesting his good will with many teares. And foorthwith there comes one in among them, who aduised them to make vp some round summe of money, &amp; there∣withall to trie if they could appease the king: and seemed likewise to intreat the captaine, that he woulde by his letters stande their friend to the king. Heereunto the captiues agreeing with one voice, promised that they would giue the king a great summe of golde, and woulde most liberally reward the captaine. The captaine, as though forsooth this condition much disliked him, asked at length how much golde they ment to send the king: one saide that he woulde disburse a thousand ducates, another, that he would giue fiue hundreth, and the third, eight hundreth. But the captaine making shew, that this was too little, saide that he was loth to make signification of so small a summe vnto the king: howbeit, better it were for you (quoth the captaine) to goe your selues vnto the king, with whom perhaps you shall make a more reasonable end then you are aware of. But they fearing hard measure, if they should be caried vnto the king, were far more importunate with the captaine then before, that he would (to his power) be good vnto them. Wherefore the captaine (as though at length he had been mooued with their vehement pe∣titions) spake vnto them in this wise: heere are of you (my masters) two and fortie noble &amp; rich persons; if you wil promise two thousand ducates a man, I will signifie on your behalfe so much vnto the king, and so I hope to per∣swade him: but if this condition will not please him, then must I needs send you to make answere for your selues. This condition they al of them yeelded vnto; howbeit with this prouizo, that euery man should giue proportiona∣blie to his wealth, and that they might haue for the paiment fifteene daies of farther respite. The twelfth day following the captaine fained, that he had receiued letters from his king, signifying that the king, for his sake, woulde shewe the captiues more fauour. The fifteenth day he had paied vnto him eightie fowre thousand ducates: neither coulde he sufficiently woonder, how in so small a towne, among two and fortie inhabitants onely, such huge sums of money could so readily be found. Then wrote he vnto his king how all matters had passed, demaunding what should be done with the gold. And so the king foorthwith sent two of his secretaries with an hundreth horse∣men
<PB N="103" REF="88"/>
to fetch home the saide golde vnto Fez. The captiues being restored to their libertie, presented the saide captaine with horses, slaues, ciuet, and such like gifts, to the value of two thousand ducates: giuing him exceeding thankes for their libertie; and requesting him to take their presents in good woorth: for, had not their treasure beene quite consumed, they saide, they woulde haue bestowed farre greater vpon him. Wherefore, from thence forward, that region was subiect vnto the king of Fez, and to the foresaide captaine <HI>Ezzeranghi,</HI> till he was trecherously slaine by certaine Arabians. Moreouer the king receiueth from that citie, euen at this present twentie thousand ducats for yeerely tribute. I haue in this narration beene indeede somewhat more large then neede required; howbeit perhaps I did it, bicause I my selfe was present in al the expedition, and was an earnest mediatour for the citizens release: neither saw I euer (to my remembrance) a greater masse of golde, then was by subtiltie drawne from them. Yea the king himselfe neuer had so much golde in his coffers at one time: for albeit he receiueth yeerely thirtie thousand ducates, yet neuer could he store himselfe with so much at once, nor his father before him. These things were done in the yeere of the Hegeira 915. and in the yeere of our Lord 1506. And here I would haue the reader to consider, what mans industrie and wit may doe in getting of money. The King maruelled much at this summe of gold; but afterward he had greater cause to woonder at the wealth of a certaine Iewe, who payed more out of his owne purse, then all the forenamed captiues. And his riches were the cause, why the King of Fez exacted fiftie thousand ducates from the Iewes, for that they were said to fauour his enimies. I my selfe bare him companie, that went in the Kings name to receiue the sayd summe of the Iewes.</P>

<HEAD>Of Seggheme a mountaine of Tedles.</HEAD>
<P>ALbeit this mountaine standeth much southerly, yet is it to be accoun∣ted one of the mountaines of Tedles. Westward it beginneth from the mountaine of Tesauon, extending it selfe eastward to mount Magran, from whence the famous riuer of Ommirabih is said to take his beginning. The south part bordreth vpon mount Dedes. The inhabitants are said origi∣nally to bee descended from the people of Zanaga: they are personable, cheerefull, valiant, and warlike people. Their weapons are dartes, Turkish swords, and daggers. They sling stones likewise with great dexteritie and force. They are at continuall war with the inhabitants of Tedles, insomuch that no merchants can passe that way without publike safe-conduct, and without great expense of mony. Their houses are so homely built, that som∣time three or fower roomes are contained in one. Of goates they haue great abundance, as likewise of mules scarcely so big as asses, which range so farre into the forrest to seeke their foode, that they are often deuoured of lions. They would neuer submit themselues to any prince; for their mountaine is so rough and steepe, that it seemeth almost impregnable. In my time the same captaine which had woon the townes of Tedles went about to assaile them in like manner. Which when the mountainers vnderstood, assem∣bling a great armie, they shrowded themselues in a certaine part of the mountaine, neere which they knew their enemies would passe. And so soone as they saw all the enemies horsemen ascended vp the hill, suddenly rushing foorth, they gaue them the onset. The skirmish was not so long as bloodie: for the captaines armie being too weake for the mountainers, could neither march on, nor retire: wherefore they were constrained to fight it out by hand-blowes: many of them with their horses being throwen headlong downe the rocks, were miserably crushed in peeces: the residue were either taken or slaine, so that I thinke scarce one man of them escaped. But of all others the captiues were most miserable: for the mountainers themselues would not slay them, but deliuered them ouer to their wiues to be tormen∣ted, who, as if they had beene she-tigres or lionesses, put them to a most hor∣rible and vile death. From thencefoorth they had no traffique nor familia∣ritie with the people of Tedles, neither seemed they greatly to stand in need of their friendship (for they haue great store of barlie, of cattell, and of sweet fountaines) vnlesse it bee for that they are excluded from all trade of mer∣chandize.</P>

It is continually couered with snow. The inhabitants haue such abundance of small and great cattell that they cannot long remaine in one place together. They build their houses of the barke of certaine trees, the rooffe whereof dependeth on slender sparres, fashioned like vnto the hoops enuironing the lids of such chests or trunks, as the wo∣men of Italie, when they trauell, carrie vpon their mules. So likewise these<NOTE PLACE="marg">These people liue like the Tartars.</NOTE> people transport their whole houses vp and downe by the strength of mules, till they haue found a fit place of aboad; where, so soone as they arriue, they plant their said houses, remaining there with their whole families, so long as they haue grasse sufficient to feede their cattell.

<P>THis high and cold mountaine greatly aboundeth with fountaines and woods. Westward it beginneth at mount Magran, extending thence almost as far as the mountaine of Adesan; and southward it bordereth vpon the plaines of Todga. The length thereof is almost fowerscore miles. Vpon the very top of this mountaine there was a citie built in ancient time, whereof a few ruinous monuments are to be seene at this present; namely certaine walles of white stone, wherein are diuers letters and wordes grauen, which the inhabitants themselues doe not vnderstand. Many are of opinion, that this citie was built long agoe by the Romans: howbeit I my selfe could neuer finde so much affirmed by any African writer, nor yet the citie it selfe mentioned. Sauing that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Essacalli</HI> in a certaine storie of his maketh mention of Tedsi, which he saith is neere vnto Segel∣messe and Dara: but he declareth not whether it bee built vpon mount Dedes or no. Howbeit for mine owne part I thinke it to be the very same:
<PB N="107" REF="90"/>
for there is no other citie in the whole region. The inhabitants of Dedes are in very deede most base people; of whom the greater part dwell in caues vn∣der the ground: their foode is barly and Elhasid, that is to say, barly meale sodden with water, and salt, which we mentioned before in our description of Hea: For heere is nothing but barly to be had. Goates and asses they haue in great abundance. The caues wherein their cattell lodge are excee∣dingly full of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Salt-peter.</NOTE> Nitre: so that I verily thinke if this mountaine were neer vnto Italy, the saide Nitre woulde yeerely be woorth fiue and twentie thousand ducates. But such is their negligence and vnskilfulnes, that they are vtterly ignorant to what purposes Nitre serueth. Their garments are so rude, that they scarce couer halfe their nakednes. Their houses are very loathsome, being annoied with the stinking smell of their goates. In all this mountaine you shall finde neither castle nor walled towne: when they builde an house, they pile one stone vpon another without any morter at all, the roofe where∣of they make of certaine rubbish, like as they doe in some places of Sisa and Fabbriano: the residue (as we haue saide) do inhabite in caues, neither sawe I euer, to my remembrance, greater swarmes of fleas then among these peo∣ple. Moreouer they are trecherous and strong theeues, so giuen to stealing and quarrelling, that for one vnkinde worde they wil not onely contend, but seeke also the destruction one of another. They haue neither iudge, priest, nor any honest gouernour among them. No merchants resort vnto them: for being giuen to continuall idlenes, and not exercising any trades or han∣die-crafts, they haue nothing meet for merchants to buy. If any merchant bring any wares into their region, vnlesse he be safe conducted by their cap∣taine, he is in danger to be robbed of altogither. And if the wares serue not for their owne necessarie vses, they will exact one fourth part of them for custome. Their women are most forlorne and sluttish, going more beggerly apparelled then the men. So continual and slauish are the toiles of these wo∣men, that for miserie, the life of asses is not comparable to theirs. And, to be briefe, neuer was I so wearie of any place in all Africa, as I was of this: how∣beit in the yeere of the Hegeira 918. being commanded by one, to whom I was in dutie bound, to trauell vnto Segelmesse, I could not choose but come this way.</P>

This prouince hath euer almost beene the prin∣cipall of the seuen before named: for it contained to the number of fortie great townes, besides three hundred castles, all which were inhabited by Bar∣barian Africans. In the 323. yeere of the Hegeira this prouince was by a certaine heretike against the Mahumetan religion called <HI>Chemim</HI> the sonne of <HI>Mennal</HI> freed from paying of tribute. This bad fellow perswaded the peo∣ple<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dangerous seducer.</NOTE> of Fez to yeeld no tribute nor honour vnto their prince, and himselfe he professed to be a prophet: but a while after he dealt not onely in matters of
<PB N="109" REF="91"/>
religion, but in commonwealth-affaires also. At length waging war against the king of Fez (who was himselfe then warring with the people of Zenete) it so befell, that a league was concluded betweene them, conditionally that <HI>Chemim</HI> shoulde enioy Temesne, and that the king should containe himselfe within his signiorie of Fez, so that from thencefoorth neither should molest other. The said <HI>Chemim</HI> gouerned the prouince of Temesne about fiue and thirtie yeeres: and his successours enioyed it almost an hun∣dred yeeres after his decease. But king <HI>Ioseph</HI> hauing built Maroco, went about to bring this prouince vnder his subiection. Whereupon he sent sun∣dry Mahumetan doctors, and priestes to reclaime the gouernour thereof from his heresie, and to perswade him, if it were possible, to yeelde vnto the king by faire meanes. Whereof the inhabitants being aduertised, they con∣sulted with a certaine kinsman of the foresaid gouernour, in the citie called <HI>Anfa,</HI> to murther the king of Maroco his ambassadours: and so they did. Soone after leuying an armie of fiftie thousand men, he marched towards Maroco, intending to expell thence the familie of Luntuna, and <HI>Ioseph</HI> their king. King <HI>Ioseph</HI> hearing of this newes, was driuen into woonderfull per∣plexitie of minde. Wherefore preparing an huge and mighty armie, he staied not the comming of his enemies: but on the sudden within three daies, hauing conducted his forces ouer the riuer of Ommirabih, he entred Temesne, when as the foresaid fiftie thousand men were so dismaied at the kings armie, that they all passed the riuer Buragrag, and so fled into Fez. But the king so dispeopled and wasted Temesne, that without all remorse he put both man, woman, and childe to the sword. This armie remained in the re∣gion eight daies, in which space they so razed and demolished all the towns<NOTE PLACE="marg">The horrible desolation of Temesne.</NOTE> and cities thereof, that there scarce remaine any fragments of them at this time. But the king of Fez on the other side hearing that the people of Te∣mesne were come into his dominions, made a truce with the tribe of Ze∣nete, and bent his great armie against the said Temesnites. And at length ha∣uing found them halfe famished neere vnto the riuer of Buragrag, he so stopped their passage on all sides, that they were constrained to run vp the craggie mountaines and thickets. At last being enuironed with the kings forces, some of them were drowned in the riuer, others were throwne downe headlong from the rocks, and the residue were miserably slaine by their ene∣mies. And for the space of ten moneths there was such hauock made among the Temesnites, that a sillie remnant of them was left aliue. But king <HI>Ioseph</HI> prince of the Luntunes returned foorthwith to Maroco for the repairing of his forces, to the end he might bid the king of Fez a battell. Howbeit Te∣mesne being bereft of her people, was left to be inhabited of wilde beastes. Neither had that prouince any new colonie, or supply of inhabitants, till that about 150. yeeres after, king <HI>Mansor</HI> returning from Tunis, brought thence certaine Arabians with him, vnto whom he gaue the possession of Temesne. And these Arabians enioyed the said prouince for fiftie yeeres, till such time as king <HI>Mansor</HI> himselfe was expelled out of his kingdome:
<PB N="110" REF="92"/>
and then were they also expolled by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and were brought vnto extreme miserie. Afterward the kings of the familie of Marin bestowed the said prouince vpon the people of Zenete and Haoara. Hence it came to passe that the said people of Zenete and Haoara were alwaies great friends vnto the Marin familie, and were thought to haue defended them from the furie of the king of Maroco. From which time they haue peaceably enioyed Maroco, &amp; now they are growne in lesse then an hundred yeeres so mighty, that they stand not in feare of the king of Fez. For they are able to bring threescore thousand horsemen to the field, and haue two hundred castles at their command.

<HEAD>Of Anfa a towne in Temesna.</HEAD>
<P>THis famous towne was built by the Romans vpon the Ocean sea shore, northward of Atlas sixtie, eastward of Azamursixtie, and westward of Rebat fortie miles. The citizens thereof were most ciuill and wealthie people: the fields thereto adioyning are exceeding fruitfull for all kinde of graine: neither doe I thinke, that any towne in all Africa is for pleasant si∣tuation comparable thereto. The plaine round about it (except it be to the sea northward) is almost fowerscore miles ouer. In olde time it was fraught with stately temples, rich ware-houses and shops, and beautifull palaces: which the monuments as yet remaining doe sufficiently testifie. They had also most large and faire gardens, out of which they gather great abundance of fruit, especially of melons, and pome-citrons euen at this day: all which are perfectly ripe by mid-Aprill. So that the inhabitants vsually carrie their fruits vnto Fez, by reason that the fruits of Fez are not so soone ripe. Their attire is trim and decent, and they haue alwaies had great traffique with the Portugals and the English. Likewise they haue many learned men among<NOTE PLACE="marg">English traf∣fique.</NOTE> them. Howbeit two reasons are alleaged of the destruction of this towne: first, because they were too desirous of libertie; and secondly, for that they maintained certaine gallies or foistes, wherewith they daily molested the Island of Cadiz and the Portugals. Wherefore at length the king of Portu∣gall sent a strong nauie of fiftie sailes against them, the consideration where∣of strooke such terrour into the inhabitants, that taking such goods as they could carrie, fome fled to Rebat, and others to Sela, and so their towne was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anfa destroied by the Portu∣gals.</NOTE> left naked to the spoile of the enemie. But the Generall of the kings fleete not knowing that they were fled, put all his forces into battell-array. How∣beit after a while being aduertised how the matter stood, he conducted his soldiers into the citie, which in one daies space they so defaced, burning the houses, and laying the walles euen with the ground, that vntill this day it hath remained voide of inhabitants. My selfe being in this place, I coulde scarce refraine from teares, when I seriously beheld the miserable ruine of

<HEAD>A description of Rebat.</HEAD>
<P>THis great and famous towne was built not many yeeres agoe by <HI>Man∣sor</HI> the king and Mahumetan patriarke of Maroco, vpon the Ocean sea shore. By the east part thereof runneth the riuer Buragrag beforenamed, and there dischargeth itselfe into the maine sea. The rocke whereon this towne is founded, standeth neere the mouth of the said riuer, hauing the riuer on the one side thereof, and the sea on the other. In building it much resem∣bleth Maroco, which <HI>Mansor</HI> willed to be a paterne thereof: sauing that it is a great deale lesse then Maroco. Some say that the reason why it was built<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why king Mansor built the towne of Rebat vpon the seashore.</NOTE> in this place was, for that king <HI>Mansor</HI> possessing the kingdome of Granada and a great part of Spaine besides, and considering that Maroco was so far distant, that if any warres should happen, he could not in due time send new forces against the Christians, determined to built some towne vpon the sea shore, where he and his armie might remaine all summer time. Some per∣swaded him to lie with his armie at Ceuta a towne vpon the streites of Gi∣braltar: but <HI>Mansor</HI> seeing that by reason of the barrennes of the soile he could not maintaine an armie royall for three or fower monethes in the towne of Ceuta, he caused this towne of Rebat in short space to be erected, and to be exceedingly beautified with temples, colleges, pallaces, shops, stoues, hospitals, and other such buildings. Moreouer on the south side without the walles he caused a certaine high tower like the tower of Maro∣co to be built, sauing that the winding staires were somewhat larger, inso∣much that three horses a-breast might well ascend vp: from the top whereof they might escrie ships an huge way into the sea. So exceeding is the height thereof, that I thinke there is no where the like building to be found. And to the end that greater store of artificers and merchants might hither from all places make resort, he appointed, that euery man according to his trade and occupation should be allowed a yeerely stipend: whereupon it came to passe that within few moneths, this towne was better stored with all kinde of artificers and merchants, then any towne in all Africa besides, and that because they reaped a double gaine. Here vsed <HI>Mansor</HI> with his troupes to remaine from the beginning of April, till the moneth of September. And whereas there was no water about the towne meete to be drunke (for the sea runneth ten miles vp into the riuer, and the wels likewise yeeld salt-water) <HI>Mansor</HI> caused fresh water to be conueied to the towne by certaine pipes and chanels, from a fountaine twelue miles distant. And the conducts hee made arch-wise, like vnto the conducts of Italie in many places and specially at Rome. So soone as the said water-conduct was deriued vnto the towne, he caused it to be diuided and sent into sundry places, as namely some pipes thereof to the temples, some to the colleges, others to the kings pallace, and the rest into the common cesternes, throughout all the citie. Howbeit after king <HI>Mansors</HI> death this towne grew into such decay, that scarce the tenth
<PB N="114" REF="94"/>
part thereof now remaineth. The said notable water-conduct was vtterly for∣done in the warre betweene the Marin-familie and the successors of <HI>Man∣sor,</HI> and the famous towne it selfe decaieth euery day more then other: so that at this present a man shall hardly finde throughout the whole towne fower hundred houses inhabited; the residue are changed into fields and vineyards. About the foresaid rocke are two or three streetes with a few shops in them, which notwithstanding are in continuall danger, for they daily feare least the Portugals should surprize them; because the Portugall king often determined their ouerthrow, thinking if he might but win Rebat, that the kingdome of Fez were easie to be conquered. Howbeit the king of Fez hath alwaies endeuoured to defend the same, and strongly to fortifie it against the enemie. But comparing their former felicitie with the present alteration whereinto they are fallen, I cannot but greatly lament their mise∣rable case.</P>

And (to say all in a word) here is no∣thing wanting, which may be required either in a most honourable citie, or in a flourishing commonwealth. Moreouer hither resort all kinde of merchants both Christians and others. Here the Genowaies, Venetians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">English traf∣fique.</NOTE> English, and lowe Dutch vsed to traffique.

And albeit this towne was in so few daies recouered from the enemie; yet a worlde it was to see, what a woonderfull altera∣tion both of the houses and of the state of gouernment happened. Many houses of this towne are left desolate, especially neere the towne-walles: which, albeit they are most stately and curiously built, yet no man there is that will inhabit them. The grounds adioyning vpon this towne are sandie: neither are they fit for corne, but for cotton-wooll in diuers places very pro∣fitable.

<HEAD>Of the towne of Mahmora.</HEAD>
<P>THis towne was built vpon the mouth of the great riuer Subu by a cer∣taine king of the Muachidin-familie, being almost halfe a mile distant from the sea, and about twelue miles from Sella. The places neere vnto it are sandie and barren. It was built (they say) of purpose to keepe the ene∣mies from entring the mouth of the said riuer. Not farre from this towne standeth a mighty wood; the trees whereof beare a kinde of nuts or acornes about the bignes of Damascen-plums, being sweeter in taste then chest∣nuts. Of which nuts certaine Arabians, dwelling neer vnto the place, conuey<NOTE PLACE="marg">Most cruell and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lions.</NOTE> great plenty vnto the citie of Fez, and reape much gaine thereby: howbeit in going to gather this fruit, vnles they take good heede vnto themselues, they are in great danger of the most cruell and deuouring lions in all Afri∣ca, which there oftentimes doe seaze vpon them. This towne a hundred and twenty yeeres agoe was razed in the foresaid warre of <HI>Sahid</HI> against the king of Fez, nothing but a few ruines thereof remaining, whereby it appeereth<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Portugals attempting to build a forte within the mouth of the riuer Subu, de∣feated of their purpose, and slaine.</NOTE> to haue beene of no great bignes. In the 921. yeere of the Hegeira the king of Portugal sent an armie to build a forte in the foresaid riuers mouth; which they accordingly attempted to doe. But hauing laide the foundations, and reared the walles a good height, the king of Fez his brother so defeated them of their purpose, that he slue of them in one night almost three thou∣sand in maner following: on a certaine morning before sun-rise three thou∣sand

Portugals marching towards the king of Fez his campe, determined to bring thence all the ordinance and field-peeces vnto their new-erected fort: howbeit most rashly and inconsiderately, themselues being but three thou∣sand, and the kings armie containing fiftie thousand footemen, and fower thousand horsemen. And yet the Portugals hoped so slyly and closely to performe this attempt, that before the Moores were ready to pursue them, they should conuey all their ordinance vnto the forte which was two miles distant. The Moores which kept the ordinance being seuen thousand men, were all asleepe when the Portugals came: whereupon the Portugals had so good successe, that they had carried the ordinance almost a mile, before the enemie was aware thereof. But at last, some rumour or alarme being gi∣uen in the Moores campe, they all betooke themselues to armes, and fierce∣ly pursued the Portugals, who likewise arranged their whole companie into battell-array. And albeit the enemie enuironed them on all sides; yet they made such stout and valiant resistance, that they had all escaped to their forte in safetie, had not certaine villains in the king of Fez his armie cried out amaine in the Portugall toong: Hold your hands (fellow soldiers) and throw downe your weapons, for the kings brother will make a truce. Which the Portugals no sooner yeelded vnto, but the sauage and merciles Moores put them euery one to the sword, sauing three or fower onely, who were sa∣ued at the request of a captaine in the Moores campe. The Portugals Gene∣rall being sore dismaied with this slaughter (for thereby he had lost all his principal soldiers) craued aide of a certaine other captaine, which by chance arriued there with a mightie fleete, being accompanied with a great number of noblemen and gentlemen. Howbeit, he was so hindred by the Moores (who daily did him all the villanie they could, and sunke diuers of his ships) that he was not able to performe that which he desired. In the meane space newes was published among the Portugals, of the king of Spaines death; whereupon diuers ships were prouided, and many Portugals were sent into Spaine. Likewise the captaine of the said new forte seeing himselfe destitute of all succour, leauing the forte, embarked himselfe in those ships, which then lay vpon the riuer. But the greatest part of the fleete were cast away at their setting foorth, and the residue, to escape the Moores shot, ran them∣selues a-ground on the flats and shouldes of the riuer, and were there mise∣rably slaine by the Moores. Many of their ships were here burnt, and their ordinance sunke in the sea. So many Christians were then slaine (some say<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lamentable slaughter.</NOTE> to the number of ten thousand) that the sea-water in that place continued red with their blood for three daies after. Soone after the Moores tooke vp fower hundred great peeces of brasse out of the sea. This huge calamitie be∣fell the Portugals for two causes: first because they would with such a small number make so rash an assault vpon the Moores, whom they knew to be so strong: and secondly, whereas the Portugall-king might at his owne cost haue sent another fleete for a new supply, he would by no meanes ioine his owne people and Castilians together. For by reason of the diuersitie of
<PB N="120" REF="97"/>
counsels and of people, there is nothing more pernicious then for an armie to consist of two nations: yea the Moores certainly expect the vpper hand, when they are to fight with such an armie.

It is exceeding rich, and containeth families to the number of six thousand. The inhabitants hereof while they dwelt in the fields liued a most peaceable life: howbeit at length they fell to dissension among themselues, and the weaker part hauing all their cattell ta∣ken from them, and hauing nothing in the fields to maintaine their estaste, agreed among themselues to build this citie of Mecnase in a most beauti∣full plaine. Neere vnto this towne runneth a little riuer: and within three miles thereof are most pleasant gardens replenished with all manner of fruits. Quinces there are of great bignes, and of a most fragrant smell; and pomegranates likewise, which being very great and most pleasant in taste, haue no stones within them, and yet they are sold exceeding cheape. Like∣wise here are plentie of damascens, of white plums, and of the fruite called Iujuba, which being dried in the sunne, they eate in the spring, and carrie a great number of them to Fez. They haue likewise great store of figs and grapes, which are not to be eaten but while they are greene &amp; new: for their figs being dried become so brittle, that they waste all to powder, and their grapes when they are made raisins, prooue vnsauorie.

In this towne are most stately and beautifull temples, three colleges, and ten bath-stoues. Euery monday they haue a great market without the towne-walles, whereunto the bordering Arabians doe vsually resort. Here are oxen, sheepe, and other such beastes to be sold: butter and wooll are here plentifull and at an easie rate. In my time the king bestowed this towne vpon a certaine noble man of his, where as much fruits are reaped as in the third part of the whole kingdome of Fez. This towne hath beene so afflicted by warres, that the yeerely tribute thereof hath beene diminished sometime fortie thousand, and fiftie thousand duckats, and som∣times more: and I haue red, that it hath beene besieged for sixe or seuen yeeres together.

Whereupon the Fessan king with a great armie besieged the towne two moneths together, and, because it would not yeeld, so wasted and destroied all the countrie thereabout, that the gouernour lost by that means fiue and twentie thousand duckats of yeerely reuenue. What then shall we thinke of the sixe and seuen yeeres siege before mentioned? At length those<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mecnase redu∣ced vnder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the king of Fez.</NOTE> citizens which fauoured the king of Fez opened the gates, and stoutly resi∣sting the contrarie faction, gaue the king and his soldiers entrance.

This most strong and beautifull citie hath many faire streetes, whereinto by conducts from a fountaine three miles distant, is conueied most sweet and holesome water, which serueth all the whole citie. The mils are two miles distant from the towne. The inhabitants are most valiant, warlike, liberall, and ciuill peo∣ple, but their wits are not so refined as others: some of them are merchants, some artificers, and the residue gentlemen. They count it vnseemely for any man to send an horse-lode of seede to his husbandman or farmer.

<P>FEz was built in the time of one <HI>Aron</HI> a Mahumetan patriarke, in the yeere of the Hegeira 185. and in the yeere of our Lord 786. by a certaine heretike against the religion of Ma∣humet.

Which etymologie seemeth to me not improbable,
<PB N="123" REF="98"/>
albeit some would haue it so called from a certaine riuer of that name. But howsoeuer it be, we leaue that to be discussed by others, affirming for an vn∣doubted truth, that the founder of this citie was one <HI>Idris,</HI> being the foresaid <HI>Aron</HI> his neere kinsman. This <HI>Idris</HI> ought rather to haue beene Mahumetan<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idris the first founder of Fe</NOTE> patriarke, because he was nephew vnto <HI>Hali</HI> the cozen-german of Mahumet, who married <HI>Falerna</HI> Mahumets owne daughter, so that <HI>Idris</HI> both by father and mother was of Mahumets linage: but <HI>Aron</HI> being nephew vnto one <HI>Habbus</HI> the vncle of Mahumet, was of kinred onely by the fathers side How∣beit both of them were excluded from the said patriarkship for certaine cau∣ses mentioned in the African chronicles, although <HI>Aron</HI> vsurped the same by deceit. For <HI>Arons</HI> vncle being a most cunning and craftie man, and fai∣ning himselfe to beare greatest fauour vnto the familie of <HI>Hali,</HI> and to bee most desirous, that the patriarkship should light thereon, sent his ambassa∣dours almost throughout the whole world. Whereupon the dignitie was translated from <HI>Vmeve</HI> to <HI>Habdulla Seffec</HI> the first patriarke. Which, <HI>Vmeve</HI> being informed of, waged warre against the familie of <HI>Hali,</HI> and so preuailed, that some of them he chased into Asia, and some into India. Howbeit an ancient religious man of the same familie remained still aliue at Elmadina, who being very olde, no whit regarded the dignitie. But this ancient sire left behinde him two sonnes, who when they were come to mans estate, grew in∣to so great fauour with the people of Elmadin, that they were chased thence by their enemies; the one being taken &amp; hanged; and the other (whose name was <HI>Idris</HI>) escaping into Mauritania. This <HI>Idris</HI> dwelling vpon mount Zaron about thirtie miles from Fez, gouerned not onely the commonwealth, but matters of religion also: and all the region adiacent paid him tribute. At length <HI>Idris</HI> deceasing without lawfull issue, left one of his maides big with childe, which had beene turned from the Gothes religion to the Moores. Being deliuered of her sonne, they called him after his fathers name, <HI>Idris.</HI> This childe the inhabitants chusing for their prince, caused him to be most carefully brought vp: and as he grew in yeeres, to the end they might traine him vp in feates of chiualrie, they appointed one <HI>Rasid</HI> a most valiant and skilfull captaine to instruct him. Insomuch, that while he was but fifteene<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idris his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> valour at fif∣teene yeeres of age.</NOTE> yeeres of age, he grew famous for his valiant actes and stratagems, and be∣gan woonderfully to inlarge his dominions. Wherefore his troupes and familie increasing euery day more and more, he set his minde vpon buil∣ding of a citie, and changing of his habitation. And so he sent for cunning builders into all nations, who hauing diligently perused all places in the region, at last made choise of that where the citie of Fez now standeth. For here they found great store of fountaines, and a faire riuer, which springing foorth of a plaine not far of, runneth pleasantly almost eight miles amidst the little hils, till at length it casteth itselfe vpon another plaine. Southward of the place they found a wood, which they knew would be right commodi∣ous for the towne. Here therefore vpon the east banke of the said riuer, they built a towne containing three thousand families: neither omitted they
<PB N="124" REF="99"/>
ought at al which might be required in a flourishing commonwealth. After the decease of <HI>Idris,</HI> his sonne erected another towne directly ouer against the foresaid, on the other side of the riuer. But in processe of time either towne so encreased, that there was but a small distance betweene them: for the gouernours of each laboured might and maine to augment their owne iurisdictions. An hundred and fowerscore yeeres after, there fell out great dissension and ciuill warre betweene these two cities, which by report con∣tinued an hundred yeeres together. At length <HI>Ioseph</HI> king of Maroco of the Luntune-familie, conducting an huge armie against both these princes, tooke them prisoners, carried them home vnto his dominions, and put them to a most cruell death. And he so vanquished the citizens, that there were slaine of them thirtie thousand. Then determined king <HI>Ioseph</HI> to re∣duce those two townes into firme vnitie and concord: for which cause, ma∣king a bridge ouer the riuer, and beating downe the walles of either towne right against it, he vnited both into one, which afterward he diuided into twelue regions or wardes.

<HEAD>A most exact description of the citie of Fez.</HEAD>
<P>A World it is to see, how large, how populous, how well-forti∣fied and walled this citie is. The most part thereof standeth vpon great and little hils: neither is there any plaine ground but onely in the midst of the citie. The riuer entreth the towne in two places, for it is diuided into a double branch, one whereof runneth by new Fez, that is, by the south side of the towne, and another commeth in at the west side. And so almost infinitely dispersing it selfe into the citie, it is deriued by certaine conducts and chanels vnto eue∣ry temple, college, inne, hospitall, and almost to euery priuate house. Vnto the temples are certaine square conducts adioined, hauing celles and recep∣tacles round about them; each one of which hath a cocke, whereby water is conueied through the wall into a trough of marble. From whence flowing into the sinks and gutters, it carrieth away all the filth of the citie into the riuer. In the midst of each square conduct standeth a lowe cesterne, being three cubites in depth, fower in bredth, and twelue in length: and the water is conueied by certaine pipes into the foresaid square conducts, which are almost an hundred and fiftie in number. The most part of the houses are built of fine bricks and stones curiously painted. Likewise their bay-win∣dowes and portals are made of partie-coloured bricke, like vnto the stones of Majorica. The roofes of their houses they adorne with golde, azure, and other excellent colours, which roofes are made of wood, and plaine on the top, to the end that in summer-time carpets may be spred vpon them, for here they vse to lodge by reason of the exceeding heate of that countrie. Some houses are of two and some of three stories high, whereunto they
<PB N="125" REF="99"/>
make fine staires, by which they passe from one roome to another vnder the same roofe: for the middle part of the house is alwaies open or vncouered, hauing some chambers built on the one side, and some on the other. The chamber-doores are very high and wide: which in rich mens houses are fra∣med of excellent and carued wood. Each chamber hath a presse curiously painted and varnished belonging thereunto, being as long as the chamber it selfe is broad: some will haue it very high, and others but sixe handfuls in height, that they may set it on the tester of a bed. All the portals of their houses are supported with bricke-pillers finely plaistered ouer, except some which stand vpon pillers of marble. The beames and transoms vpholding their chambers are most curiously painted and carued. To some houses like∣wise belong certaine square cesternes, containing in bredth sixe or seuen cubites, in length ten or twelue, and in height but sixe or seuen handfuls, be∣ing all vncouered, and built of bricks trimly plaistered ouer. Along the sides of these cesternes are certaine cocks, which conuey the water into marble∣troughes, as I haue seene in many places of Europe. When the foresaide conducts are full of water, that which floweth ouer, runneth by certaine se∣cret pipes and conueiances into the cesternes: and that which ouerfloweth the cesternes, is carried likewise by other passages into the common sinks and gutters, and so into the riuer. The said cesternes are alwaies kept sweete and cleane, neither are they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but onely in summer-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when men, women, and children bathe themselues therein. Moreouer on the tops of their houses they vsually build a turret with many pleasant roomes therein, whither the women, for recreations sake, when they are wearie of working, retire themselues; from whence they may see well-nigh all the citie ouer. Of Mahumetan temples and oratories there are almost seuen hundred in<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Mahu∣metan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Fez.</NOTE> this towne, fiftie whereof are most stately and sumptuously built, hauing their conducts made of marble and other excellent stones vnknowen to the Italians; and the chapiters of their pillers be artificially adorned with pain∣ting and caruing. The tops of these temples, after the fashion of Christian churches in Europe, are made of ioises and planks: but the pauement is co∣uered with mats which are so cunningly sowed together, that a man cannot see the bredth of a finger vncouered. The walles likewise on the inner side are lined a mans height with such mats. Moreouer, each temple hath a turret or steeple, from whence certaine are appointed with a lowd voice to call the people at their set-time of praier. Euery temple hath one onely priest to say seruice therin; who hath the bestowing of all reuenues belōging to his owne temple, as occasion requireth: for thereby are maintained lampes to burne in the night, and porters to keepe the doores are paid their wages out of it, and so likewise are they that call the people to ordinarie praiers in the night season: for those which crie from the said towers in the day-time haue no wages, but are onely released from all tributes and exactions.

good mile and a halfe about. This temple hath one and thirtie gates or por∣tals of a woonderfull greatnes and height. The roofe of this temple is in length 150. and in bredth about fowerscore Florentine cubites. The turret or steeple, from whence they crie amaine to assemble the people to∣gither, is exceedingly high; the bredth whereof is supported with twentie, and the length with thirtie pillers. On the east, west, and north sides, it hath certaine walkes or galleries, fortie cubites in length, and thirtie in bredth. Vnder which galleries there is a cell or storehouse, wherein oile, candles, mats, and other such necessaries for the temple are laid vp. Euery night in this temple are burnt nine hundred lightes; for euery arch hath a seuerall lampe, especially those which extend through the mid-quire. Some ar∣ches there are that haue 120. candles apeece: there are likewise certaine brasse-candlestickes so great and with so many sockets, as they will holde each one fifteene hundred candles: and these candlestickes are reported to haue beene made of bels, which the king of Fez in times past tooke from Christians. About the wals of the said temple are diuers pulpits, out of which those that are learned in the Mahumetan lawe instruct the people. Their winter-lectures begin presently after sun-rise, and continue the space of an hower. But their summer-lectures holde on from the sunne going downe, till an hower and a halfe within night. And here they teach as well morall philosophie as the law of Mahumet. The summer-lectures are per∣formed by certaine priuate and obscure persons; but in winter such onely are admitted to read, as be reputed their greatest clerkes. All which readers and professours are yeerely allowed most liberall stipends. The priest of this great temple is inioined onely to read praiers, and faithfully to distribute almes among the poore. Euery festiuall day he bestoweth all such corne and money as he hath in his custodie, to all poore people, according to their neede. The treasurer or collector of the reuenues of this church hath euery day a duckat for his pay. Likewise he hath eight notaries or clerkes vnder him; euery one of which gaineth sixe duckats a moneth: and other sixe clerks who receiue the rent of houses, shops, and other such places as be∣long to the temple, hauing for their wages the twentith part of all such rents and duties as they gather. Moreouer there belong to this temple twentie factors or bailies of husbandrie, that without the citie-walles haue an eie to the labourers, plowemen, vine-planters, and gardeners, and that prouide them things necessarie: their gaine is three duckats a moneth. Not far from the citie are about twentie lime-kils, and as many bricke-kils, seruing for the reparation of their temple, and of all houses thereto belonging. The reue∣nues<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reuenues of the great temple, and how they are bestowed.</NOTE> of the said temple daily receiued, are two hundred duckats a day; the better halfe whereof is laid out vpon the particulars aforesaid. Also if there be any temples in the citie destitute of liuing, they must all be maintained at the charges of this great temple: and then that which remaineth after all expences, is bestowed for the behoofe of the commonwealth: for the peo∣ple receiue no reuenues at all. In our time the king commanded the priest
<PB N="127" REF="100"/>
of the said temple to lend him an huge summe of money, which he neuer repaied againe. Moreouer in the citie of Fez are two most stately colleges, of which diuers roomes are adorned with curious painting; all their beames are carued, their walles consisting both of marble and freestone. Some col∣leges here are which containe an hundred studies, some more, and some fewer, all which were built by diuers kings of the Marin-familie. One there is among the rest most beautifull and admirable to behold, which was ere∣cted by a certaine king called <HI>Habu Henon.</HI> Here is to be seene an excellent fountaine of marble, the cesterne whereof containeth two pipes. Through this college runneth a little streame in a most cleere and pleasant chanell, the brims and edges whereof are workmanly framed of marble, and stones of Majorica. Likewise here are three cloysters to walke in, most curiously and artificially made, with certaine eight-square pillers of diuers colours to support them. And betweene piller and piller the arches are beautifully ouercast with golde, azure, and diuers other colours; and the roofe is very artificially built of wood. The sides of these cloysters are so close, that they which are without cannot see such as walke within. The walles round about as high as a man can reach, are adorned with plaister-worke of Majorica. In many places you may finde certaine verses, which declare what yeere the college was built in, together with many epigrams in the founders com∣mendation. The letters of which verses are very great and blacke, so that they may be red a far off. This college-gates are of brasse most curiously carued, and so are the doores artificially made of wood. In the chappell of this college standeth a certaine pulpit mounted nine staires high, which staires are of iuorie and eben. Some affirme, that the king hauing built this college, was desirous to knowe how much money he had spent in building it; but after he had perused a leafe or two of his account-booke, finding the summe of fortie thousand duckats, he rent it asunder, and threw it into the foresaid little riuer, adding this sentence out of a certaine Arabian writer: Each pretious and amiable thing, though it costeth deere, yet if it be beau∣tifull, it cannot choose but be good cheape: neither is any thing of too high a price, which pleaseth a mans affection. Howbeit a certaine treasurer of the kings, making a particular account of all the said expences, found that this excellent building stood his master in 480000. duckats. The other colleges of Fez are somwhat like vnto this, hauing euery one readers and professors, some of which read in the forenoone, and some in the afternoone. In times past the students of these colleges had their apparell and victuals allowed them for seuen yeeres, but now they haue nothing gratìs but their chamber. For the warre of <HI>Sahid</HI> destroied many possessions, whereby learning was<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of learning and learned men, a principall cause of disorderly &amp; base gouern∣ment.</NOTE> maintained; so that now the greatest college of al hath yeerely but two hun∣dred, and the second but an hundred duckats for the maintenance of their professors. And this perhaps may be one reason, among many, why the go∣uernment not onely of Fez, but of all the cities in Africa, is so base. Now these colleges are furnished with no schollers but such as are strangers, and
<PB N="128" REF="101"/>
liue of the citie-almes: and if any citizens dwell there, they are not aboue two or three at the most. The professor being ready for his lecture, some of his auditors readeth a text, whereupon the said professor dilateth, and expla∣neth obscure and difficult places. Sometimes also the schollers dispute be∣fore their professor.</P>

<HEAD>A description of the hospitals and bathes in the citie of Fez.</HEAD>
<P>MAny hospitals there are in Fez, no whit inferiour, either for building or beautie, vnto the foresaid colleges. For in them whatsoeuer stran∣gers came to the citie were intertained at the common charge for three daies together. There are likewise as faire and as stately hospitals in the sub∣urbes. In times past their wealth was maruellous great; but in the time of <HI>Sahids</HI> warre, the king standing in neede of a great summe of money, was counselled by some of his greedy courtiers to sell the liuings of the said hos∣pitals. Which when the people would in no case yeeld vnto, the kings ora∣tour or speaker, perswaded them that all those liuings were giuen by his ma∣iesties predecessours, and therefore (because when the warres were ended, they should soone recouer all againe) that it were far better for them by that meanes to pleasure their soueraigne, then to let his kingly estate fall into so great danger. Whereupon all the said liuings being sold, the king was pre∣uented by vntimely and sudden death before he could bring his purpose to effect: and so these famous hospitals were depriued of all their maintenance. The poore indeede and impotent people of the city are at this day relieued; but no strangers are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, saue only learned men or gentlemen. How∣beit there is another hospital for the releefe of sick &amp; diseased strangers, who haue their diet onely allowed them, but no phisition or medicine: certaine women there are which attend vpon them, till they recouer their former health, or die. In this hospitall likewise there is a place for franticke or di∣straught persons, where they are bound in strong iron chaines; whereof the part next vnto their walks is strengthened with mighty beames of wood and iron. The gouernour of these distraught persons, when he bringeth them any sustenance, hath a whip of purpose to chastise those that offer to bite, strike, or play any mad part. Sometimes it falleth out that these franticke people will call vnto them such as passe by; declaring how vniustly they are there detained, and how cruelly they are handled by the officers, when as notwithstanding they affirme themselues to bee restored vnto their right minde. And hauing thus perswaded the commers-by, approching neerer and neerer vnto them, at length they take hold with one hand on their gar∣ments, and (like villans) with the other hand they shamefully defile their faces and apparell with dung. And though all of them haue their priuies and close stooles, yet would they be poysoned in their owne filth, if the seruants did not often wash their lodgings: so that their abhominable and continuall
<PB N="129" REF="101"/>
stinke is the cause why citizens neuer visite them. Likewise this hospitall hath many roomes for the purueiors, notaries, cookes, and other officers<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn Leo in his youth a notarie of an hospitall for two yeeres together.</NOTE> belonging to the sicke persons; who each of them haue some small yeerely stipend. Being a yoong man I my selfe was notarie heere for two yeeres, which office is woorth three duckats a moneth.</P>
<P>In this citie are moe then an hundred bath-stoues very artificially and stately built: which though they be not of equall bignes, yet are they all of one fashion. Each stoue hath fower halles, without which are certaine galle∣ries in an higher place, with fiue or sixe staires to ascend vnto them: here men put off their apparell, and hence they goe naked into the bath. In the midst they alwaies keepe a cesterne full of water. First therefore they that meane to bathe themselues must passe through a cold hall, where they vse to temper hot water and cold together, then they goe into a roome some∣what hotter, where the seruants clense and wash them; and last of all they proceede into a third hot-house, where they sweate as much as they thinke good. Of the said water they giue vnto euery man two vessels onely: but he that will haue more and will be extraordinarily washed, must giue to the ser∣uant one Liardo at the least, and to the master of the stoue but two far∣things. The fire that heateth their water is made of nought else but beastes dung: for which purpose many boyes are set on worke to run vp and downe to stables, and thence to carrie all the dung, and to lay it on heapes without the towne-walles; which being parched in the sunne for two or three mo∣nethes together, they vse for fewell. Likewise the women haue their stoues apart from the men. And yet some hot-houses serue both for men and wo∣men, but at sundry times, namely for men from the third to the fourteenth hower of the day, and the residue for women. While women <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bathing themselues, they hang out a rope at the first entrance of the house, which is a signe for men, that they may then proceed no farther. Neither may hus∣bands here be permitted to speake with their owne wiues; so great a regarde they haue of their honestie. Here men and women both, after they haue done bathing, vse to banquet and make merrie with pleasant musicke and singing. Yoong striplings enter the bath starke naked without any shame, but men couer their priuities with a linnen cloth. The richer sort will not enter the common bath, but that which is adorned and finely set foorth, and which serueth for noblemen and gentlemen. When any one is to be bathed, they lay him along vpon the ground, annointing him with a certaine oint∣ment, and with certaine instruments doing away his filth. The richer sort haue a carpet to lie on, their head lying on a woodden cushion couered with the same carpet. Likewise here are many barbers and chirurgions which at∣tend to doe their office. The most part of these baths pertaine to the tem∣ples and colleges, yeelding vnto them a great summe of money for yeerely rent; for some giue an hundred, some an hundred and fiftie duckats a yeere. Neither must I here omit the festiuall day which the seruants and officers of the bathes yeerely celebrate. Who with trumpets and pipes calling their
<PB N="130" REF="102"/>
friendes together, goe foorth of the towne, and there gather a wilde onion, putting it in a certaine brazen vessell, and couering the same with a linnen cloth wet in lee: afterward with a great noise of trumpets and pipes they solemnely bring the said onion vnto the hot-house doore, and there they hang it vp in the little brazen vessell or lauer, saying that this is a most happy boading or signe of good lucke vnto their stoue. Howbeit I suppose it to be some such sacrifice, as the ancient Moores were woont in times past, when they were destitute of lawes and ciuilitie, to offer, and that the same custome hath remained till this very day. The like is to be seen euen among Christi∣ans, who celebrate many feasts whereof they can yeeld no reason. Likewise euery African towne had their peculiar feast, which, when the Christians once enioied Africa, were vtterly abolished and done away.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Innes of Fez.</HEAD>
<P>IN this citie are almost two hundred innes, the greatest wher∣of are in the principall part of the citie neere vnto the chiefe temple. Euery of these innes are three stories high, and con∣taine an hundred and twenty or moe chambers apeece. Like∣wise each one hath a fountaine together with sinks and water∣pipes, which make auoidance of all the filth. Neuer, to my remembrance, did I see greater buildings, except it were the Spanish college at Bologna, or the pallace of the Cardinall <HI>di San Giorgio</HI> at Rome: of which innes all the chamber-doores haue walkes or galleries before them. And albeit the innes of this citie are very faire and large, yet they affoord most beggerly enter∣tainment to strangers: for there are neither beds nor couches for a man to lie vpon, vnlesse it be a course blanket and a mat. And if you will haue any victuals, you must goe to the shambles your selfe, and buie such meate for your host to dresse, as your stomack stands-to. In these innes certaine poore widowes of Fez, which haue neither wealth nor friends to succour them, are relieued: sometimes one, and sometimes two of them together are allowed a chamber; for which courtesie they play both the chamberlaines and cookes of the inne. The inne-keepers of Fez being all of one familie called Elcheua, goe apparelled like women, and shaue their beards, and are so de∣lighted to imitate women, that they will not only counterfeite their speech, but will sometimes also sit downe and spin. Each one of these hath his con∣cubine, whom he accompanieth as if she were his owne lawfull wife; albeit the said concubines are not onely ill-fauoured in countenance, but notori∣ous for their bad life and behauiour. They buie and sell wine so freely, that no man controules them for it. None resort hither but most lewd &amp; wicked people, to the end they may more boldly commit villany. The inne-keepers haue a consul ouer them, and they pay tribute vnto the gouernour of the citie. And when the king hath occasion to send foorth an armie, then they, as being most meete for the purpose, are constrained largely to victuall the
<PB N="131" REF="102"/>
campe. Had not the streit law of historie enforced me to make relation of the foresaid particulars as they stand, I would much rather haue smothered such matters in silence, as tend so extremely to the disgrace of Fez; which being reformed, there is not any citie in al Africa, for the honestie and good demeanour of the citizens, comparable thereunto. For the very companie of these inne-keepers is so odious and detestable in the sight of all honest men, learned men, and merchants, that they will in no wise vouchsafe to speake vnto them. And they are firmely enioined not to enter into the tem∣ple, into the burse, nor into any bath. Neither yet are they permitted to re∣sort vnto those innes which are next vnto the great temple, and wherein merchants are vsually entertained. All men in a manner are in vtter detesta∣tion of these wretches: but because the kings armie hath some vse of them (as is aforesaid) they are borne withall, whether the citizens will or no.</P>

<HEAD>Of the mils of Fez.</HEAD>
<P>IN this citie are mils in fower hundred places at least. And euery of these places containeth fiue or sixe mils; so that there are some thousands of mils in the whole citie. Euery mill standeth in a large roome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Like vnto our horse-mils.</NOTE> vpon some strong piller or post; whereunto many countrie-people vse to resort. Cer∣taine merchants there are in Fez, which hiring mils and shops, buie corne and sell it ready ground vnto the citizens, whereby they reape exceeding gaine: for the greatest part of the citizens being poore, and not able to lay vp corne sufficient in store, are faine to buie meale of them. But the richer sort buie their owne corne, and send it to some common mill, where they pay a shilling for the grinding of each measure. All the saide mils pertaine either to the temples or colleges: for he must be very rich that hath a mill of his owne; for euery mill gaineth the owner two duckats.</P>

<HEAD>A description of the occupations, the shops, and the market.</HEAD>
<P>EAch trade or occupation hath a peculiar place allotted thereto, the principall whereof are next vnto the great temple: for there first you may beholde to the number of fowerscore notaries or scriueners shops, whereof some ioine vpon the temple, and the residue stand ouer against them: euery of which shops hath alwaies two notaries. Then westward there are about thirtie stationers or booke-sellers. The shoo-merchants which buie shooes and buskins of the shoomakers, and sell them againe to the citizens, inhabite on the south side of the temple: and next vnto them, such as make shooes for children onely, their shops being about fiftie. On the east side dwell those that sell vessels and other commodities made of brasse. Ouer against the great gate of the said temple stands the fruit-market, containing fiftie shops, where no kinde of fruit is wanting. Next vnto them stand the
<PB N="132" REF="103"/>
waxe-merchants, very ingenious and cunning workmen, and much to be admired. Here are merchants factors likewise, though they be but few. Then followes the herbe-market, wherein the pome-citrons, and diuers kindes of greene boughes and herbes doe represent the sweete and flourishing spring, and in this market are about twentie tauernes: for they which drinke wine, will shrowd themselues vnder the shadie and pleasant boughes. Next vnto them stand the milke-sellers, who haue great store of such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vessels by them, as the Italians call <HI>Vasidi Maiolica:</HI> but their milke they cause to be brought thither in certaine vessels of wood bound with iron-hoops, being narrow-mouthed and broad at the bottome. From these milke-sellers some there are which daily buie great store of milke to make butter thereof: and the residue of their milke they sell either crudded or sometimes sower vnto the citizens: so that I thinke there passeth scarce one day ouer their heads, wherein they vtter not fiue and twentie tunnes of milke. Next vnto these are such as sell cotton, and they haue about thirtie shops: then follow those that sell hempe, ropes, halters, and such other hempen commodities. Then come you to the girdlers, and such as make pantofles, and leather-bridles embrodered with silke: next, their shops adioine that make sword-scabberds and caparisons for horses. Immediately after dwell those that sell salt and lime. And vpon them border an hundred shops of potters, who frame all kinde of earthen vessels adorned with diuers colours. Then come you to the sadlers-shops: and next of all to the street of porters, who (as I suppose) are<NOTE PLACE="marg">The porters of Fez.</NOTE> aboue three hundred: these porters haue a consul or gouernour, who euery weeke allotteth vnto part of them some set busines. The gaine which re∣doundeth thereof they put into a coffer, diuiding it at the weekes end among them, which haue wrought the same weeke. Strange it is to consider how exceedingly these porters loue one another; for when any of them decea∣seth, the whole companie maintaineth his widow and fatherlesse children at their common charge, till either she die, or marrieth a new husband. The children they carefully bring vp, till they haue attained to some good arte or occupation. Whosoeuer of them marrieth and hath children by his wife, inuiteth most part of his companie vnto a banquet: who being thus inuited, present each of them some gift or other vnto the good man, or his wife. No man can be admitted into their companie, vnlesse first he banque∣teth the principall men thereof: otherwise he is to haue but halfe a share of the common gaine. Free they are from all tributes and exactions: yea their bread is baked of free cost. If any of them be taken in any hainous offence, he is not publikely but priuately punished. While they are at worke they all weare short garments of one colour: and at vacant times they are apparel∣led as themselues thinke good: but howsoeuer it be, they are most honest and faire-conditioned people. Next vnto the porters companie dwell the chiefe cookes and victuallers. Here also stands a certaine square house co∣uered with reed, wherein pease and turnep-rootes are to be sold, which are so greatly esteemed of in Fez, that none may buie them of the countrie∣people
<PB N="133" REF="103"/>
at the first hand, but such as are appointed, who are boūd to pay tole &amp; tribute vnto the customers: &amp; scarcely one day passeth, wherein mo then 500. sacks of pease and turneps are not sold. And albeit (as we haue said) they are so much esteemed of, yet are they sold at a most easie price: for a man may buie 30, or at least 20. pound weight for one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his Italian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> calleth it Bai∣oco.</NOTE> Liardo. Greene beanes likewise in time of yeere are sold good cheape. Not far frō the place before mentioned are certaine shops, wherein lumps or steakes of flesh beaten in a morter, &amp; thē fried with oile, &amp; seasoned with much spice, are to be bought, euery one of the said lumps or steakes being about the bignes of a fig, &amp; be∣ing made only of dried beefe. On the north side of the temple is a place whi∣ther all kind of herbes are brought to make sallets withall: for which purpose there are 40. shops appointed. Next wherunto is The place of smoke, so cal∣led by reason of continuall smoke: here are certaine fritters or cakes fried in oile, like vnto such as are called at Rome <HI>Pan Melato.</HI> Of these fritters great store are daily vttered: for euery day they vse to breake their fasts therwith, &amp; especially vpon festiual daies: vnto which fritters they adde for a conclusion either rostmeat or honie: somtimes they steepe them in an homely kinde of broth made of bruised meat, which being sodden, they bray the second time in a morter, making pottage therof, &amp; colouring it with a kinde of red earth. They roste their flesh not vpon a spit, but in an ouen: for making two ouens one ouer another for the same purpose, in the lower they kindle a fire, put∣ting the flesh into the vpper ouen when it is wel het. You would not beleeue how finely their meat is thus rosted, for it cannot be spoiled either by smoke, or too much heat: for they are all night rosting it by a gentle fire, and in the morning they set it to sale. The foresaid steakes &amp; fritters they sell vnto the citizens in so great abūdance, that they daily take for them mo thē 200. duc∣kats. For there are 15. shops which sell nothing else. Likewise here are sold certaine fishes &amp; flesh fried, &amp; a kind of excellent sauorie bread, tasting som∣what like a fritter: which being baked with butter, they neuer eat but with but∣ter and honie Here also are the feet of certaine beasts sodden; wherewith the husbandmen betimes in the morning breake their fast, and then hie them to their labour. Next vnto these are such as sell oile, salt, butter, cheese, oliues, pome-citrons &amp; capers: their shops are full of fine earthen vessels, which are of much greater value then the things contained in them. Their butter and honie they sell by certaine criers, which are porters appointed for the same office. Neither doe they admit euery one to fill their vessels; but that worke is reserued for certaine porters appointed to doe it, which also fill the mea∣sures of oile when merchants buie the same. The said vessels are sufficient to containe an hundred and fiftie pounds of butter; for so much butter the countrie-people put into each vessell. Then follow the shambles, consisting of about fortie shops, wherein the butchers cut their flesh a peeces, and sell it by weight. They kill no beastes within the shambles, for there is a place allotted for this purpose neere vnto the riuer, where hauing once dressed their flesh, they send it to the shambles by certaine seruants appointed for
<PB N="134" REF="104"/>
that end. But before any butcher dare sell his flesh vnto the citizens, he must carrie it to the gouernour of the shambles, who so soone as he seeth the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gouernour of the shambles in Fez.</NOTE> flesh, he sets downe in a peece of paper the price thereof, which they shew together with their meate vnto the people; neither may they in any case exceed the said price. Next vnto the shambles standeth the market where course cloathes are sold, which containeth at least an hundred shops: the said cloth is deliuered vnto certaine criers (which are about threescore in number) who carrying the cloth from shop to shop tell the price thereof, and for the selling of euery duckats-woorth they haue two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In the Italian copie they are called Baiochi.</NOTE> Liardos allowed them. This traffique of cloth indureth from noone till night, to the mer∣chants great aduantage. Then follow their shops that scowre and sell ar∣mour, swordes, iauelings, and such like warlike instruments. Next vnto them stand the fishmongers, who sell most excellent and great fish, taken both in the riuer of Fez and in other waters, exceeding cheape; for you may buie a pound of fish for two farthings onely. There is great abundance of the fish called in Rome <HI>Laccia,</HI> and that especially from the beginning of October till the moneth of Aprill, as we will declare more at large when we come to speake of the riuers. Next vnto the fishmongers dwell such as make of a cer∣taine hard reed, coopes and cages for fowles; their shops being about fortie in number. For each of the citizens vseth to bring vp great store of hennes and capons. And that their houses may not be defiled with hennes-dung, they keepe them continually in coopes and cages. Then follow their shops that sell liquide sope, but they be not many, for you shall finde more of them in other partes of the citie. Neither make they sope at Fez onely, but also in the mountaines thereabout, from whence it is brought vnto the citie vpon mules backes. Next of all are certaine of their shops that sell meale, albeit they are diuersly dispersed throughout the whole citie. Next vnto them are such as sell seed-graine and seed-pulse: which you cannot buie of any citi∣zen, because that euery one had rather keepe his corne in store: many there are likewise in the same place, that will carrie pulse or corne to mules or hor∣ses, whithersoeuer you will haue them. A mule vseth to carrie three measures of pulse vpon his backe (which the muliter is enioined to measure) in three sacks lying one vpon another. Then are there ten shops of them that sell straw. Next them is the market where threed and hempe is to be sold, and where hempe vseth to be kempt: which place is built after the fashion of great houses, with fower galleries or spare-roomes round about it: in the first whereof they sell linnen-cloth, and weigh hempe: in two other sit a great many women hauing abundance of sale-threed, which is there solde by the criers, who carrie the same vp and downe from noone till night. In the midst of this place growe diuers mulberie trees, affoordiug pleasant shade and shelter vnto the merchants: and hither such swarmes of women resort, that a man shall hardly withdraw himselfe from among them: good sport it is sometime to see how they will barret and scould one at another: yea and oftentimes you shall see them fall together by the eares. Let vs now
<PB N="135" REF="104"/>
come to the west part; which stretcheth from the temple to that gate that leadeth vnto Mecnase. Next vnto the smokie place before mentioned, their habitations directly stand, that make leather-tankards, to draw water out of wels; of whom there are some fourteene shops. Vnto these adioine such as make wicker-vessels and other, to lay vp meale and corne in: and these enioy about thirtie shops. Next them are 150. shops of tailors. And next the tailors are those that make leather-shieldes, such as I haue often seene brought into Europe. Then follow twenty shops of laundresses or washers, being people of a base condition; to whom the citizens that haue not maids of their owne, carrie their shirtes and other fowle linnen, which after few daies are restored vnto them so cleane and white as it is woonderfull. These laundresses haue diuers shops adioining together in the same place: but here and there throughout the citie are aboue two hundred families of such persons. Next vnto the laundresses are those that make trees for saddles; who dwell likewise in great numbers eastwarde right in the way to the college founded by king <HI>Abuhinan.</HI> Vpon these adioine about fortie shops of such as work stirrops, spurres, and bridles, so artificially, as I thinke the like are not to be seene in Europe. Next standeth their street, that first rudely make the said stirrops, bridles, and spurres. From thence you may go into the street of sadlers, which couer the saddles before mentioned threefold with most ex∣cellent leather: the best leather they lay vppermost, and the woorst beneath, and that with notable workmanship; as may be seene in most places of Italie. And of them there are moe then an hundred shops. Then follow their long shops that make pikes and launces. Next standeth a rocke or mount, hauing two walks thereupon; the one whereof leadeth to the east gate, and the other to one of the kings pallaces, where the kings sisters, or some other of his kinred are vsually kept. But this is by the way to be noted, that all the foresaid shops or market begin at the great temple: howbeit, that I might not inuert my set-order, I haue onely described those places that are round about the said temple, minding last of all to speake of the merchants station or burse.</P>

<HEAD>Of the station or burse of merchants in Fez.</HEAD>
<P>THis burse you may well call a citie, which being walled round about hath twelue gates, &amp; before euery gate an iron chaine, to keepe horses &amp; cartes from comming in. The said burse is diuided into 12. seuerall wards or partes: two whereof are allotted vnto such shoomakers as make shooes onely for noblemen and gentlemen, and two also to silke-merchants or haberdashers, that sell ribands, garters, skarfes, and such other like orna∣ments; and of these there are about fiftie shops. Others there are that sell silke onely for the embrodering of shirts, cushions, and other such furniture made of cloth, possessing almost as many shops as the former. Then follow those that make womens girdles of course wooll (which some make of silke)

but very grossely, for I thinke they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then two fingers thicke, so that they may serue almost for cables to a ship. Next vnto these girdlers are such as sell woollen and linnen cloth brought out of Europe: which haue also silke-stuffes, caps, and other like commodities to sell. Hauing passed these, you come to them that sel mats, mattresses, cushions, and other things made of leather. Next adioineth the customers office; for their cloth is sent about by certaine criers to be solde, who before they can passe, must goe to the customers to haue the said cloth sealed, and to pay toll vnto the custo∣mers. Criers here are, to the number of sixtie, which for the crying of euery cloth haue one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> Liardo allowed them. Next of all dwell the tailors, and that in three seuerall streetes. Then come you to the linnen-drapers, which sell smocks and other apparell for women: and these are accounted the ri∣chest merchants in all Fez, for their wares are the most gainful of all others. Next vnto these are certaine woollen garments to be sold, made of such cloth as is brought thither out of Europe. Euery afternoone cloth is sold in this place by the criers, which is lawfull for any man to doe, when neces∣sarie occasion vrgeth him. Last of all is that place where they vse to sell wrought shirts, towels, and other embrodered works; as also where carpets, beds, and blankets are to be sold.</P>

And each citie alwaies had either Romans or Goths to receiue and take charge of the tribute.

Which course had the Italians imitated, they had neuer beene spoiled so often of their goods. For in ciuill wars it many times befalleth, that the greedie soldi∣ers not being satisfied with the enimies goods, will prey vpon the wealth of their friendes.</P>

<HEAD>Of the grocers, apothecaries, and other tradesmen, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Fez.</HEAD>
<P>NExt vnto the said burse, on the north side, in a streight lane, stand an hundred and fiftie grocers and apothecaries shops, which are fortified on both sides with two strong gates. These shops are garded in the night season by certaine hired and armed watchmen, which keepe their station

with lanternes and mastiues. The said apothecaries can make neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, ointments, nor electuaries: but such things are made at home by the phisi∣tions, and are of them to be bought. The phisitions houses adioine for the most part vnto the apothecaries: howbeitvery few of the people knowe either the phisition or the vse of his phisicke. The shops here are so artifici∣ally built and adorned, that the like (I thinke) are no where else to be found.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn Leo was at Tauris in Persia.</NOTE> Being in Tauris a citie of Persia, I remember that I saw diuers stately shops curiously built <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certaine galleries, but very darke, so that (in my iudge∣ment) they be far inferiour vnto the shops of Fez. Next the apothecaries are certaine artificers that make combes of boxe and other wood. Eastward of the apothecaries dwell the needle-makers, possessing to the number of fiftie shops. Then follow those that turne iuorie, and such other matter, who (because their craft is practised by some other artizans) are but few in number. Vnto the turners adioine certaine that sell meale, sope, &amp; brooms: who dwelling next vnto the threed-market beforementioned, are scarce twenty shops in all: for the residue are dispersed in other places of the citie, as we will hereafter declare. Amongst the cotton-merchants are certaine that sell ornaments for tents, and beds. Next of all stand the fowlers, who, though they be but few, yet are they stored with all kinde of choise and dain∣tie fowles: whereupon the place is called the fowlers market. Then come you to their shops that sell cords and ropes of hempe: and then to such as make high corke slippers for noblemen and gentlemen to walke the streetes in, when it is fowle weather: these corke-slippers are finely trimmed with much silke, and most excellent vpper leathers, so that the cheapest will cost a duckat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some there are of ten duckats, and some of fiue and twentie duckats price. Such slippers as are accounted most fine and costly are made of blacke and white mulberie-tree, of blacke walnut-tree, and of the Iujuba∣tree, albeit the corke-slippers are the most durable and strong. Vnto these adioine ten shops of Spanish Moores, which make crosse-bowes: as also those that make broomes of a certaine wilde palme-tree, such as are daily brought out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Rome. These broomes they cartie about the citie in a great basket, either selling them, or exchanging them for bran, ashes, or olde shooes: the bran they sell againe to shepherds, the ashes to such as white threed, &amp; the old shooes to coblers. Next vnto them are smithes that make nailes; &amp; coopers which make certaine great vessels in forme of a buc∣ket, hauing corne-measures to sell also: which measures, when the officer, appointed for the same purpose, hath made triall of, he is to receiue a far∣thing apeece for his fee. Then follow the wooll-chapmen, who hauing bought wooll of the butchers, put it foorth vnto others to be scowred and washed: the sheepe-skins they themselues dresse: but as for oxe-hides they belong to another occupation, and are tanned in another place. Vnto these adioine such as make certaine langols or withs, which the Africans put vpon their horses feete. Next of all are the braziers; then such as make weights and measures; and those likewise that make instruments to carde
<PB N="138" REF="106"/>
wooll or flaxe. At length you descend into a long streete, where men of di∣uers occupations dwell together, some of which doe polish and enamell stirrops, spurres, and other such commodities, as they receiue from the smithes roughly and rudely hammered. Next whom dwell certaine cart∣wrights, plow-wrights, mill-wrights, and of other like occupations. Diers haue their aboad by the riuers side, and haue each of them a most cleere fountaine or cesterne, to wash their silke-stuffes in. Ouer against the diers dwell makers of bulwarkes or trenches, in a very large place, which being planted with shadie mulberie-trees is exceeding pleasant in the summer∣time. Next them are a companie offarriers, that shooe mules and horses: and then those that make the iron-worke of crosse-bowes. Then followe smithes that make horse-shooes; and last of all those that white linnen-cloth: and here the west part of the citie endeth, which in times past (as is aforesaid) was a citie by it selfe, and was built after the citie on the east side of the riuer.</P>

<HEAD>A description of the second part of Fez.</HEAD>
<P>THe second part of Fez situate eastward, is beautified with most stately palaces, temples, houses, and colleges; albeit there are not so many trades and occupations as in the part before described. For here are neither merchants, tailors, shoomakers, &amp;c. but of the meaner sort. Here are notwithstanding thirtie shops of grocers. Neere vnto the walles dwell cer∣taine bricke-burners and potters: and not far from thence is a great market of white earthen vessels, platters, cups, and dishes. Next of all standes the corne-market, wherein are diuers granaries to lay vp corne. Ouer against the great temple there is a broad street paued with brick, round about which diuers handy-crafts and occupations are exercised. There are likewise many other trades diuersly dispersed ouer this east part of the citie. The drapers and grocers haue certaine peculiar places allotted vnto them. In this east part of Fez likewise there are fiue hundred and twenty weauers houses, very stately and sumptuously built: hauing in each of them many worke-houses and loomes, which yeeld great rent vnto the owners. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there are (by report) in this citie twenty thousand, and as many millers. Moreouer in this part of Fez are an hundred shops for the whiting of threed; the principall whereof being situate vpon the riuer, are exceedingly well furnished with kettles, cauldrons, and other such vessels: here are likewise many great hou∣ses to saw wood in, which worke is performed by Christian captiues, and whatsoeuer wages they earne, redoundeth vnto their Lordes and masters. These Christian captiues are not suffered to rest from their labours, but only vpon fridaies, and vpon eight seuerall daies of the yeere besides, where∣on the Moores feastes are solemnized. Here also are the common stewes for harlots, which are fauoured by great men, and sometime by the cheefe gouernours of the citie. Likewise there are certaine vintners, who are freely permitted to keepe harlots, and to take filthie hire for them. Here are also
<PB N="139" REF="106"/>
moe then sixe hundred cleere fountaines walled round about and most cha∣rily kept, euery one of which is seuerally conueied by certaine pipes vnto each house, temple, college, and hospitall: and this fountaine-water is ac∣counted the best: for that which commeth out of the riuer is in summer oftentimes dried vp: as likewise when the conducts are to be cleansed, the course of the riuer must of necessitie be turned out of the citie. Wherefore euery familie vseth to fetch water out of the said fountaines, and albeit in summer-time the chiefe gentlemen vse riuer-water, yet they will often call for fountaine-water, because it is more coole and pleasant in taste. But in the spring-time it is nothing so. These fountaines haue their originall for the most part from the west and south, for the north part is all full of mountains and marble-rocks, containing certaine caues or cels, wherein corne may be kept for many yeeres; of which caues some are so large, that they will holde two hundred bushels of corne. The citizens dwelling neere those caues, and such as possesse them, do sufficiently maintaine themselues in taking yeere∣ly euery hundred bushell for rent. The south part of east Fez is almost halfe destitute of inhabitants: howbeit the gardens abound with fruites and flow∣ers of all sortes. Euery garden hath an house belonging thereunto, and a christall-fountaine enuironed with roses and other odoriferous flowers and herbes; so that in the spring-time a man may both satisfie his eies, and so∣lace his minde in visiting this part of the citie: and well it may be called a Paradise, sithence the noblemen doe here reside from the moneth of April till the end of September. Westward, that is, toward the kings palace, stan∣deth a castle built by a king of the Luntune-familie, resembling in bignes an whole towne: wherein the kings of Fez, before the said palace was built, kept their royal residence. But after new Fez began to be built by the Marin∣kings, the said castle was left onely to the gouernour of the citie. Within this castle standes a stately temple built (as aforesaid) what time it was inhabited by princes and nobles, many places being afterward defaced and tur∣ned into gardens: howbeit certaine houses were left vnto the gouernour, partly to dwell in, and partly for the deciding of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Here is like∣wise a certaine prison for captiues supported with many pillers, and being so large, that it will hold (as diuers are of opinion) three thousand men. Nei∣ther are there any seuerall roomes in this prison: for at Fez one prison ser∣ueth for all. By this castle runneth a certaine riuer very commodious for the gouernour.</P>

<HEAD>Of the magistrates, the administration of iustice; and of the apparell vsed in Fez.</HEAD>
<P>IN the citie of Fez are certaine particular iudges and magistrates: and there is a gouernour that defineth ciuill controuersies, and giueth sen∣tence against malefactors. Likewise there is a iudge of the canon law, who hath to doe with all matters concerning the Mahumetan religion. A third
<PB N="140" REF="107"/>
iudge there is also that dealeth about marriages and diuorcements, whose authoritie is to heare all witnesses, and to giue sentence accordingly. Next vnto them is the high aduocate, vnto whom they appeale from the sentence of the saide iudges, when as they doe either mistake themselues, or doe ground their sentence vpon the authoritie of some inferiour doctor. The gouernour gaineth a great summe of money by condemning of parties at seuerall times. Their manner of proceeding against a malefactor is this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The punish∣ment of male∣factors in Fez.</NOTE> hauing giuen him an hundred or two hundred stripes before the gouer∣nour, the executioner putteth an iron-chaine about his necke, and so lea∣deth him starke-naked (his priuities onely excepted) through all partes of the citie: after the executioner followes a sergeant, declaring vnto all the people what fact the guiltie person hath committed, till at length hauing put on his apparell againe, they carrie him backe to prison. Sometimes it falleth out that many offenders chained together are led about the citie: and the gouernour for each malefactor thus punished, receiueth one duckat and one fourth part; and likewise at their first entrance into the iaile, he de∣maunds of each one a certaine dutie, which is paid particularly vnto him by diuers merchants and artificers appointed of purpose. And amongst his other liuings, he gathereth out of a certaine mountaine seuen thousand duc∣kats of yeerely reuenue: so that when occasion serueth, he is at his proper costs to finde the king of Fez three hundred horses, and to giue them their pay. Those which follow the canon-lawe haue neither stipend nor rewarde allowed them: for it is forbidden by the law of Mahumet, that the iudges of his religion should reape any commoditie or fees by their office; but that they shoulde liue onely by reading of lectures, and by their priesthood. In this facultie are many aduocates and proctors, which are extreme idiotes, and vtterly voide of all good learning. There is a place also in Fez whereinto the iudges vseto cast the citizens, for debt, or for some light of∣fence. In all this citie are fower officers or sergeants onely; who from mid∣night till two a clocke in the morning doe walke about all partes of the citie; neither haue they any stipend, but a certaine fee of such malefactors as they lead about in chaines, according to the qualitie of euery mans crime; more∣ouer, they are freely permitted to sell wine, and to keepe harlots. The saide gouernour hath neither scribes nor notaries, but pronounceth all sentences by word of mouth. One onely there is that gathereth customes and tributes ouer all the citie, who daily paieth to the kings vse thirtie duckats. This man appointeth certaine substitutes to watch at euery gate, where nothing, be it of neuer so small value, can passe before some tribute be paid. Yea sometime they goe foorth of the citie to meete with the carriers and muliters vpon the high waies, to the end they may not conceale nor closely conuey any merchandize into the citie. And if they be taken in any deceite, they pay double. The set order or proportion of their custome is this, namely to pay two duckats for the woorth of an hundred: for Onix-stones, which are brought hither in great plentie, they pay one fourth part: but for wood,
<PB N="141" REF="107"/>
corne, oxen, and hennes, they giue nothing at all. Neither at the entring of the citie doe they pay any tribute for rammes, but at the shambles they giue two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Baiochi.</NOTE> Liardos apeece, and to the gouernour of the shambles one. The said gouernour of the shambles hath alwaies twelue men waiting vpon him, and oftentimes he rideth about the citie to examine the weight of bread, and finding any bread to faile of the due waight, he causeth the baker to be beaten with cudgels, and to be led in contempt vp and downe the citie. The said office was woont to be allotted vnto men of singular honestie; but now adaies euery ignorant and lewd person enioieth it. The citizens of Fez goe very ciuilly and decently attired, in the spring-time wearing garments made of outlandish cloth: ouer these shirtes they weare a iac∣ket or cassocke being narrow and halfe-sleeued, whereupon they weare a certaine wide garment, close before on the breast. Their caps are thinne and single, like vnto the night-caps vsed in Italie, sauing that they couer not their eares: these caps are couered with a certaine skarfe, which being twise wreathed about their head and beard, hangeth by a knot. They weare neither hose nor breeches, but in the spring-time when they ride a iourney they put on bootes: mary the poorer sort haue onely their cassocke, and a mantle ouer that called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> Barnussi, and a most course cap. The doctors and ancient gentlemen weare a certaine garment with wide sleeues, somewhat like to the gentlemen of Venice. The common sort of people are for the most part clad in a kinde of course white cloth. The women are not altogether vn∣seemely apparelled, but in sommer-time they weare nothing saue their smocks onely. In winter they weare such a wide sleeued garment, being close at the breast, as that of the men before mentioned. When they goe abroad, they put on certaine long breeches, wherewith their legs are all couered, hauing also, after the fashion of Syria, a vaile hanging downe from their heads, which couereth their whole bodies. On their faces likewise they weare a maske with two little holes onely for their eies, to peepe out at. Their eares they adorne with golden eare-rings &amp; with most pretious iewels: the meaner sort weare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of siluer and gilt only. Vpon their armes the ladies and gentlewomen weare golden bracelets, and the residue siluer, as likewise gold or siluer-rings vpon their legs, according to each ones estate and abilitie.</P>

<HEAD>Of their manner of eating and drinking.</HEAD>
<P>LEt vs now speake somewhat of their victuals and manner of eating. The common sort set on the pot with fresh meat twise euery weeke: but the gentlemen and richer sort euery day, and as often as they list. They take three meales a day: their breakefast consisteth of certaine fruits and bread, or else of a kinde of liquid pap made like vnto frumentie: in winter they sup off the broth of sal flesh thickened with course meale. To dinner they haue flesh, sallets, cheese, and oliues: but in summer they haue greater cheere. Their supper is easie of digestion, consisting of bread, melons, grapes, or
<PB N="142" REF="108"/>
milke: but in winter they haue sodden flesh, together with a kinde of meate called Cuscusu, which being made of a lumpe of dowe is set first vpon the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A kinde of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> called Cuscusu.</NOTE> fire in certaine vessels full of holes, and afterwarde is tempered with butter and pottage. Some also vse often to haue roste-meat. And thus you see after what sort both the gentlemen &amp; common people lead their liues: albeit the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fare somewhat more daintily: but if you compare them with the noblemen and gentlemen of Europe, they may seeme to be miserable and base fellowes; not for any want or scarcitie of victuals, but for want of good manners and cleanlines. The table whereat they sit is lowe, vncouered, and filthie: seats they haue none but the bare ground, neither kniues or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but only their ten talons. The said Cuscusu is set before them all in one only platter, whereout as well gentlemen as others take it not with spoones, but with their clawes fiue. The meat &amp; pottage is putal in one dish; out of which euery one raketh with his greasie fists what he thinkes good: you shall ne∣uer see knife vpon the table, but they teare and greedily deuoure their meate like hungrie dogs. Neither doth any of them desire to drinke before he hath well stuffed his panch; and then will he sup off a cup of cold water as big as a milke-bowle. The doctors indeede are somewhat more orderly at meales: but, to tell you the very truth, in all Italie there is no gentleman so meane, which for fine diet and stately furniture excelleth not the greatest poten∣tates and lords of all Africa.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The manner of solemnizing mariages.</HEAD>
<P>AS touching their mariages, they obserue these courses following. So soone as the maides father hath espoused her vnto her louer, they goe foorthwith like bride and bridegroome to church, accompanied with their parents and kinsfolkes, and call likewise two notaries with them to make re∣cord before all that are present of the couenants and dowrie. The meaner sort of people vsually giue for their daughters dowrie thirtie duckats and a woman-slaue of fifteene duckats price; as likewise a partie-coloured gar∣ment embrodered with silke, and certaine other silke skarfs or iags, to weare vpon her head in stead of a hood or vaile; then a paire of fine shooes, and two excellent paire of startups; and lastly many pretie knackes curiously made of siluer and other metals, as namely combes, perfuming-pans, bel∣lowes, and such other trinkets as women haue in estimation. Which being done, all the guests present are inuited to a banket, whereunto for great dain∣ties is brought a kinde of bread fried and tempered with honie, which wee haue before described; then they bring roste-meate to the boord, all this being at the bridegroomes cost: afterward the brides father maketh a ban∣ket in like sort. Who if he bestow on his daughter some apparell besides her dowrie, it is accounted a point of liberalitie. And albeit the father promiseth but thirtie duckats onely for a dowrie, yet will he sometimes bestow, in ap∣parell and other ornaments belonging to women, two hundred, yea some∣times
<PB N="143" REF="108"/>
three hundred duckats besides. But they seldome giue an house, a vine∣yarde, or a field for a dowrie. Moreouer vpon the bride they bestowe three gownes made of costly cloth; and three others of silke chamlet, or of some other excellent stuffe. They giue her smockes likewise curiously wrought, with fine vailes, and other embrodered vestures; as also pillowes and cushi∣ons of the best sort. And besides all the former giftes, they bestow eight car∣pets or couerlets on the bride, fower whereof are onely for seemelines to spread vpon their presses and cupboords: two of the courser they vse for their beds; and the other two of leather, to lay vpon the floore of their bed∣chambers. Also they haue certaine rugs of about twenty elles compasse or length; as likewise three quilts being made of linnen and woollen on the one side, and stuffed with flockes on the other side, which they vse in the night in manner following. With the one halfe they couer themselues, and the other halfe they lay vnder them: which they may easily doe, when as they are both waies about ten elles long. Vnto the former they adde as many couerlets of silke very curiously embrodered on the vpperside, and beneath lined double with linnen and cotton. They bestow likewise white couerlets to vse in summer-time onely: and lastly they bestow a woollen hanging di∣uided into many partes, and finely wrought, as namely with certaine peeces of gilt leather; whereupon they sowe iags of partie-coloured silke, and vpon euery iag a little ball or button of silke, whereby the saide hanging may for ornaments sake be fastened vnto a wall. Here you see what be the appurte∣nances of their dowries; wherein some doe striue so much to excell others, that oftentimes many gentlemen haue brought themselues vnto pouertie thereby. Some Italians thinke that the husband bestowes a dowrie vpon his wife; but they altogether mistake the matter. The bridegroome being ready to carrie home his bride, causeth her to be placed in a woodden cage or cabinet eight-square couered with silke, in which she is carried by por∣ters, her parents and kinsfolkes following, with a great noise of trumpets, pipes, and drums, and with a number of torches; the bridegroomes kinsmen goe before with torches, and the brides kinsfolkes followe after: and so they goe vnto the great market place, and hauing passed by the temple, the bride∣groome takes his leaue of his father in lawe and the rest, hying him home with all speed, and in his chamber expecting the presence of his spouse. The father, brother, and vncle of the bride lead her vnto the chamber-doore, and there deliuer her with one consent vnto the mother of the bridegroome: who, as soone as she is entred, toucheth her foote with his, and foorthwith they depart into a seuerall roome by themselues. In the meane season the banket is comming foorth: and a certaine woman standeth before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doore, expecting till the bridegroome hauing defloured his bride reacheth her a napkin stained with blood, which napkin she carrieth incon∣tinent and sheweth to the guestes, proclaiming with a lowd voice, that the bride was euer till that time an vnspotted and pure virgine. This woman to∣gether with other women her companions, first the parents of the bride∣groome
<PB N="144" REF="109"/>
and then of the bride doe honourably entertaine. But if the bride be found not to be a virgine, the mariage is made frustrate, and she with great disgrace is turned home to her parents. At complete mariages they make for the most part three bankets: the first the same day when the bride∣groome and bride are ioined in wedlocke; the second the day following for women onely; and the third seuen daies after; whereat all the kinsfolks and friends of the bride are present; and this day the brides father, according to his abilitie, sendes great store of daintie dishes vnto his sonne in lawe: but so soone as the new married man goeth foorth of the house (which is for the most part on the seuenth day after the mariage) he buieth great plentie of fishes, which he causeth his mother or some other woman to cast vpon his wiues feete; and this they, from an ancient superstitious custome, take for a good boading. Likewise at the bridegroomes fathers they vse to make two other feasts; the one vpon the day before the bride is married; and so that night they spend in dauncing and disport. The morrow after a companie of women goe to dresse the bride, to combe her locks, and to paint her cheekes with vermillion; her hands and her feete they die blacke, but all this pain∣ting presently looseth the fresh hew; and this day they haue another ban∣ket. The bride they place in the highest roome that she may be seene of all, and then those that dressed the bride are condignely entertained. Being come to the bridegroomes house, his parents salute the new bride with cer∣taine great cups full of new wine and cakes, with other iuncats, (which wee wil here passe ouer in silence) all which are bestowed vpon the bridegroomes companions. The same night which we said was spent in dauncing, there are present at the bridall-house certaine minstrels and singers, which by turnes sometimes vse their instruments and sometimes voice-musicke: they daunce alwaies one by one, and at the end of each galliard they bestow a largesse vpon the musitions. If any one wil honour the dancer, he bids him kneele downe before him, and hauing fastened peeces of money all ouer his face, the musitions presently take it off for their fee. The women daunce alone without any men, at the noise of their owne musitions. All these things vse to be performed when the bride is a maide. But the mariages of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The marriage of widowes.</NOTE> widowes are concluded with lesse adoe. Their cheere is boiled beefe and mutton, and stued hens, with diuers iuncating dishes among. In stead of trenchers, the guestes being ten or twelue in number, haue so many great round platters of wood set before them. And this is the common custome of gentlemen and merchants. The meaner sort present their guestes with certaine sops or bruesse of bread like vnto a pan-cake, which being dipped in flesh-pottage, they eate out of a great platter not with spoones but with their fingers onely: and round about each great platter stand to the number of ten or twelue persons. Likewise they make a solemne feast at the circum∣cision of their male children, which is vpon the seuenth day after their birth;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The circumci∣sion of their children.</NOTE> and at this feast the circumciser, together with all their friends and kinsfolks is present: which being done, each one, according to his abilitie, bestoweth
<PB N="145" REF="109"/>
a gift vpon the circumciser in manner following. Euery man laies his mo∣ney vpon a lads face which the circumciser brought with him. Whereupon the lad calling euery one by his name, giueth them thanks in particular: and then the infant being circumcised, they spend that day with as great iollitie as a day of mariage. But at the birth of a daughter they shew not so much alacritie.</P>

The women hauing by death lost<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their funerals.</NOTE> their husbands, fathers, or any other of their deere friends, assemble foorth∣with a great multitude of their own sexe together, who stripping themselues out of their owne attire, put on most vile sackcloth, and defile their faces with much durt: then call they certaine men clad in womens attire, bring∣ing great fower-square drums with them, at the noise of which drums the women-mourners sing a funerall song, tending as much as may be, to the commendation of the partie deceased: and at the end of euery verse, the said womē vtter most hideous shrikes &amp; outcries, tearing their haire, &amp; with much lamentation beating their cheekes &amp; breasts, till they be all-imbrued with blood: and so these heathenish superstitions continue for seuen whole daies together. At which seuen daies ende they surcease their mourning for the space of 40. daies, &amp; then they begin anew to torment thēselues for three daies togither in maner aforesaid: howbeit these kinds of obsequies are ob∣serued onely by the baser people, but the gentlemen and better sort behaue themselues more modestly. At this time all the widowes friends come about her to comfort her, and send diuers kinds of meats vnto her: for in the mour∣ning house they may dresse no meate at all, till the dead corpes be carried foorth.

<HEAD>A description of the grammar-schooles in Fez.</HEAD>
<P>OF schooles in Fez for the instructing of children, there are almost two hundred, euery one of which is in fashion like a great hall. The schoolemasters teach their children to write and read not out of a booke, but out of a certaine great table. Euery day they expound one sentence of the Alcoran: and hauing red quite through they begin it againe, repeating it so often, til they haue most firmely committed the same to memorie: which they doe right well in the space of 7. yeeres. Then read they vnto their scholers some part of orthographie: howbeit both this and the other parts of Grammar are far more exactly taught in the colleges, then in these triuiall schooles. The said schoolemasters are allowed a very small stipend; but when their boies haue learned some part of the Alcoran, they present certaine gifts vnto their ma∣ster, according to each ones abilitie. Afterward so soon as any boy hath per∣fectly learned the whole Alcaron, his father inuiteth all his sonnes schoole∣fellowes vnto a great banket: and his sonne in costly apparell rides through the street vpon a gallant horse, which horse and apparell the gouernour of the royall citadell is bound to lend him. The rest of his schoole-fellowes being mounted likewise on horse-backe accompany him to the banketing house, singing diuers songs to the praise of God and of Mahumet. Then are they brought to a most sumptuous banket, whereat all the kinsfolkes of the foresaid boyes father are vsually present: euery one of whom bestoweth on the schoolemaster some small gift, and the boyes father giues him a new sute of apparell. The said scholers likewise vse to celebrate a feast vpon the birth-day of Mahumet, and then their fathers are bound to send each man a torch vnto the schoole: whereupon euery boy carrieth a torch in his hand, some of which waigh thirty pound. These torches are most curiously made, being adorned round about with diuers fruits of waxe, which being lighted betimes in the morning doe burne till sun-rise, in the meane while certaine singers resound the praises of Mahumet, and so soone as the sunne is vp, all their solemnitie ceaseth: this day vseth to be very gainfull vnto the schoole∣masters, for they sell the remnant of the waxe vpon the torches for an hun∣dred

<HEAD>Of the fortune-tellers and some other artizans in Fez.</HEAD>
<P>WE haue said nothing as yet of the leather-dressers, who haue diuers mansions by the riuers side, paying for euery skin an halfepeny cu∣stome, which amounteth yeerely almost vnto three hundred duckats. Here are likewise chirurgions &amp; barbers, whom, because they are so few, I thought not to haue mentioned in this place. Now let vs speake of the fortune-tellers and diuiners, of whom there is a great number, and three kindes. For one<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three sorts of diuiners in Fez.</NOTE> sort vseth certaine Geomanticall figures. Others powring a drop of oile into a viall or glasse of water, make the saide water to bee transparent and bright, wherein, as it were in a mirrour, they affirme that they see huge swarmes of diuels that resemble an whole armie, some whereof are trauel∣ling, some are passing ouer a riuer, and others fighting a land-battell, whom when the diuiner seeth at quiet, he demandeth such questions of them as he is desirous to be resolued of: and the diuels giue them answere with beck∣ning, or with some gesture of their hands or eies: so inconsiderate and dam∣nable is their credulitie in this behalfe. The foresaid glasse-viall they will de∣liuer into childrens hands scarce of eight yeeres old, of whom they will aske whether they see this or that diuell. Many of the citie are so besotted with these vanities, that they spend great summes vpon them. The third kinde of diuiners are women-witches, which are affirmed to haue familiaritie with diuels: some diuels they call red, some white, and some blacke diuels: and when they will tell any mans fortune, they perfume themselues with cer∣taine odours, saying, that then they possesse themselues with that diuell which they called for: afterward changing their voice, they faine the diuell to speake within them: then they which come to enquire, ought with great feare &amp; trembling aske these vile &amp; abominable witches such questions as they meane to propound, and lastly offering some fee vnto the diuell, they depart. But the wiser and honester sort of people call these women <HI>Sahaoat,</HI> which in Latin signifieth <HI>Fricatrices,</HI> because they haue a damnable custome to commit vnlawfull Venerie among themselues, which I cannot expresse in any modester termes. If faire women come vnto them at any time, these abominable witches will burne in lust towardes them no otherwise then lustie yoonkers doe towards yoong maides, and will in the diuels behalfe demaunde for a rewarde, that they may lie with them: and so by this meanes it often falleth out, that thinking thereby to fulfill the diuels
<PB N="149" REF="111"/>
command they lie with the witches. Yea some there are, which being allured with the delight of this abominable vice, will desire the companie of these witches, and faining themselues to be sicke, will either call one of the wit∣ches home to them, or will send their husbands for the same purpose: and so the witches perceiuing how the matter stands, will say that the woman is possessed with a diuell, and that she can no way be cured, vnlesse she be ad∣mitted into their societie. With these words her silly husband being persua∣ded, doth not onely permit her so to doe, but makes also a sumptuous ban∣ket vnto the damned crew of witches: which being done, they vse to daunce very strangely at the noise of drums: and so the poore man commits his false wife to their filthie disposition. Howbeit some there are that will soone coniure the diuell with a good cudgell out of their wiues: others faining themselues to be possessed with a diuell, wil deceiue the said witches, as their wiues haue been deceiued by them.</P>

<HEAD>Of the coniurers, inchanters, and iuglers in Fez.</HEAD>
<P>IN Fez likewise there are a kinde of iuglers or coniurers called <HI>Muhaz∣zimin:</HI> who of all others are reported to be most speedie casters out of diuels. And because their Necromancie sometimes taketh effect, it is a won∣der to see into what reputation they grow thereby: but when they cannot cast foorth a diuell, they say it is an airie spirite. Their manner of adiuring diuels is this: first they drawe certaine characters and circles vpon an ash∣heape or some other place; then describe they certaine signes vpon the hands and forehead of the partie possessed, and perfume him after a strange kinde of manner. Afterward they make their inchantment or coniuration; enquiring of the diuell, which way or by what meanes he entred the partie, as likewise what he is, and by what name he is called, and lastly charging him to come foorth. Others there are that worke by a certaine Cabalisticall rule called <HI>Zairagia:</HI> this rule is contained in many writings, for it is thought to be naturall magique: neither are there any other Necromancers in all Fez, that will more certainly and truly resolue a doubtfull question; how∣beit their arte is exceeding difficult: for the students thereof must haue as great skill in Astrologie, as in Cabala. My selfe in times past hauing attained to some knowledge in this facultie, continued (I remember) an whole day in describing one figure onely: which kinde of figures are described in manner following. First they draw many circles within the compasse of a great cir∣cle: in the first circle they make a crosse, at the fower extremities whereof they set downe the fower quarters of the world, to wit, East, West, North, and South: at each end of one of the said crosse lines, they note either pole: likewise about the circumference of the first circle, they paint the fower elements: then diuide they the same circle and the circle following into fower partes: and euery fourth part they diuide into other seuen, each one being distinguished with certaine great Arabian characters, so that
<PB N="150" REF="112"/>
euery element containeth eight and twentie characters. In the third circle they set downe the seuen planets; in the fourth the twelue signes of the Zo∣diacke; in the fift the twelue Latine names of the moneths; in the sixt the eight and twentie houses of the moone; in the seuenth the 365. daies of the yeere, and about the conuexitie thereof, the fower cardinall or principall windes. Then take they one onely letter of the question propounded, multi∣plying the same by all the particulars aforenamed, &amp; the product or summe totall they diuide after a certaine manner, placing it in some roome, accor∣ding to the qualitie of the character, and as the element requireth wherein the said character is found without a figure. All which being done, they marke that figure which seemeth to agree with the foresaid number or sum produced, wherewith they proceed as they did with the former, till they haue found eight and twentie characters, whereof they make one word, and of this word the speech is made that resolueth the question demanded: this speech is alwaies turned into a verse of the first kinde, which the Arabians call <HI>Ethauil,</HI> consisting of eight <HI>Stipites</HI> and twelue <HI>Chordi,</HI> according to the meeter of the Arabian toong, whereof we haue intreated in the last part of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Arabian grammar writ∣ten by Iohn Leo.</NOTE> our Arabian grammar. And the verse consisting of those characters, com∣prehendeth alwaies a true and infallible answer vnto the question propoun∣ded, resoluing first that which is demanded, and then expounding the sense of the question it selfe. These practitioners are neuer found to erre, which causeth their arte of Cabala to be had in great admiration: which although it be accounted naturall, yet neuer saw I any thing that hath more affinitie with supernaturall and diuine knowledge. I remember that I saw in a certaine open place of king <HI>Abulunan</HI> his college in Fez, vpon a floore paued with excellent smooth marble, the description of a figure. Each side of this floore or court was fiftie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> long, and yet two third parts thereof were occupied about the figure, and about the things pertaining thereto: three there were that made the description, euery one attending his appointed place, and they were an whole day in setting it downe. Another such figure I saw at Tu∣nis, drawen by one that was maruellous cunning in the arte, whose father had written two volumes of commentaries or expositions vpon the pre∣cepts of the same arte, wherein whosoeuer hath exact skill, is most highly esteemed of by all men. I my selfe neuer sawe but three of this profession, namely one at Tunis, and two other at Fez: likewise I haue seene two expo∣sitions vpon the precepts of the said arte, together with a commentarie of one <HI>Margian</HI> father vnto the foresaid Cabalist which I sawe at Tunis: and another written by <HI>Ibnu Caldim</HI> the historiographer. And if any were desi∣rous to see the precepts and commentaries of that arte, he might doe it with the expence of fiftie duckats: for sailing to Tunis a towne neere vnto Italie, he might haue a sight of all the particulars aforesaid. I my selfe had fit opor∣tunitie<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuination and soothsaying forbidden by the lawe of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> of time, and a teacher that offered to instruct me gratìs in the same arte: howbeit I thought good not to accept his offer, because the said arte is forbidden and accounted hereticall by the law of Mahumet: for Mahumets
<PB N="151" REF="112"/>
law affirmeth all kinde of diuinations to be vaine, and that God onely know∣eth secrets and things to come: wherefore sometimes the saide Cabalistes are imprisoned by the Mahumetan inquisitours, who cease not to persecute the professours of that arte.</P>

<HEAD>Of certaine rules and super stitions obserued in the Mahumet an law.</HEAD>
<P>HEre also you may finde certaine learned men, which will haue them∣selues called wizards and morall philosophers. They obserue certaine rules which Mahumet neuer prescribed. By some they are accounted catho∣lique or true Mahumetans, and by others they are holden for heretiks, how∣beit the greatest part of the common people reuerence them as if they were gods, notwithstanding they commit many things vnlawfull and forbidden<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuers Mahu∣metan sects.</NOTE> by the Mahumetan lawe, as namely; whereas the said lawe forbiddeth any loue-matters to be expressed in any musicall ditties or songs, these moralists affirme the contrarie. In the foresaid Mahumetan religion are a great num∣ber of rules or sectes, euery of which hath most learned patrones and prote∣ctours. The foresaid sect sprang vp fowerscore yeeres after Mahumet, the first author thereof being called <HI>Elhesen Ibnu Abilhasen,</HI> and being borne in the towne of Basora: this man taught his disciples &amp; followers certaine pre∣cepts, but writings he left none behinde him. About an hundred yeeres after there came another notable doctor of that sect from Bagaded, called <HI>Elharit Ibnu Esed,</HI> who left volumes of writings vnto his disciples. Afterward those that were found to be his followers, were all condemned by the Mahumetan patriarks and lawyers. Howbeit 80. yeeres after, that sect began to reuiue againe vnder a certaine famous professour, who drew after him many disci∣ples, vnto whom he published his doctrine. This man at length and all his followers were by the patriarke and lawyers condemned to die. Which he vnderstanding, wrote foorthwith vnto the patriarke, requesting that hee might be licenced to dispute with the lawyers as touching his doctrine, of whom if he were conuinced, he would most willingly suffer death; otherwise that it would be against all equitie, that so many innocents should perish vpon an vniust accusation. The patriarke thinking his demand to be reaso∣nable, condescended wholy thereunto. But when the matter came to dispu∣tation, the partie condemned soone put all the lawyers to silence. Which when the patriarke perceiued, he reuoked the sentence as vniust, and caused many colleges and monasteries to be erected for the said partie and his fol∣lowers. After which time this sect continued about an hundred yeeres, till the emperour <HI>Malicsach</HI> of the Turkish race came thither out of Asia the greater, and destroied all the maintainers thereof. Whereupon some of them fled vnto Cairo, and the rest into Arabia, being dispersed here and there for the space of twenty yeeres, till in the raigne of <HI>Caselsah</HI> nephew vnto <HI>Malicsach, Nidam Elmule</HI> one of his counsellers, and a man of an high
<PB N="152" REF="113"/>
spirit, being addicted vnto the said sect, so restored, erected, and confirmed the same, that by the helpe of one <HI>Elgazzuli</HI> a most learned man (who had written of the same argument a notable worke diuided into seuen partes) he reconciled the lawyers with the disciples of this sect, conditionally, that the lawyers should be called Conseruers of the prophet Mahumet his lawes, &amp; the sectaries Reformers of the same. This concord lasted betweene them, til Bagaded was sacked by the Tartars; which befell in the yeere of the Hegeira<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sacked by the Tartars.</NOTE> 656. at what time those sectaries so increased, that they swarmed almost ouer all Africa and Asia. Neither would they admit any into their societie, but such as were very learned, and trained vp in all kinde of liberall sciences; to the end they might the better defend their owne opinions, and confute their aduersaries: but now adaies they admit all kinde of rude and ignorant persons, affirming all sortes of learning to be needlesse; for the holy spirit (say they) reuealeth the knowledge of the truth vnto such as are of a cleane hart; and they alleage many reasons for the confirmation of this their opi∣nion, though not very forcible. Wherefore despising their ancesters rites, and the strict obseruations of the law, they addict themselues to nought else but delights and pleasures, feasting often &amp; singing lasciuious songs. Some∣times they will rend their garments, either alluding thereby to the verses that they sing, or being mooued thereunto by their corrupt and vile disposi∣tion; saying falsly that they are then rauished with a fit of diuine loue: but I rather impute it to their abundance of meat, and gluttonie. For each one of them will deuoure as much meate, as may well suffice three. Or (which is more likely) they vtter those passionate clamours and out-cries, bicause they are inflamed with vnlawfull and filthie lust. For sometimes it happeneth that some one of the principall of them, with all his scholers and disciples, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the mariage of some gentleman, and at the beginning of the banket they will rehearse their deuout orizons and songs, but so soone as they are risen from the table, the elder of the companie being about to daunce, teare their garments: and if any one in the middest of their dauncing, that hath drunke immoderately, chaunceth to fall downe, he is taken vp foorthwith by one of the scholers, and to too lasciuiously kissed.

<HEAD>Of diuers other rules and sectes, and of the superstitious credulitie of many.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst these sectes there are some, that haue not onely a diuers law, but also a different beleefe from the residue, whereupon by some others they are called heretikes. Some there are also which hold, that a man by good works, by fasting and abstinence, may attaine vnto the nature of an angell, which good works, fastings, &amp;c. doe (say they) so purge and free the minde from all contagion of euill, that by no meanes it can sinne any more,
<PB N="153" REF="113"/>
though it would neuer so faine. Howbeit they thinke themselues not capa∣ble of this felicitie, before they haue ascended thereunto by the degrees of fiftie disciplines or sciences: and although they fall into sinne before they be come to the fiftith degree, yet they say that God will not impute that sinne vnto them. These fellowes indeed in the beginning leade a most strict life, and doe euen macerate and consume themselues with fasting; but afterward they giue themselues to al licentiousnes and pleasure. They haue also a most seuere forme of liuing set downe in fower bookes, by a certaine learned man of their faction, called <HI>Essehrauar de Sehrauard,</HI> and borne in the citie of Co∣rasan. Likewise there was another author called <HI>Ibnul Farid,</HI> that described all their religion in wittie verses, which being fraught with allegories seemed to intreate of nought but loue: wherefore one <HI>Elfargani</HI> expounded the said verses with a commentarie, and thereout gathered the canons and orders of the sect, and shewed the degrees to the attainment of felicitie. Moreouer the said verses are so sweet and elegant, that the maintainers of this sect will sing and repeate none other in their bankets: for these three hundred yeeres no author hath so adorned their language as the said <HI>Ibnul.</HI> These sectaries take the heauens, the elements, the planets, and the fixed starres to be one god, and that no law nor religion is erronious: for euery man (say they) may law∣fully worship that which his mind is most addicted to worship. They thinke that all the knowledge of God was infused into one man, whom they call in their language <HI>Elcorb;</HI> this man, they say, was elect by god, and was made equall in knowledge to him. Fourtie there are among them called all by the name of <HI>Elauted,</HI> which signifieth in our language, a blocke, or stocke of a tree: out of this number, when their Elcoth deceaseth, they create another in his roome, namely seuentie persons that haue the authoritie of election committed vnto them. There are likewise 765. others (whose names I doe not well remember) who are chosen into the said electors roomes, when any of them decease. These 765. being bound thereunto by a certaine canon or rule of their order, are constrained alwaies to goe vnknowen, and they range almost all the world ouer in a most vile and beggerly habite, so that a man would take them for mad men and estranged from all sense of huma∣nitie: for these lewd miscreants vnder pretence of their religion run like roagues naked and sauage throughout all Africa, hauing so little regarde of honestie or shame, that they will like brute beastes rauish women in publike places; and yet forsooth the grosse common people reuerence them as men of woonderfull holines. Great swarmes of these filthie vagabonds you may see in Tunis, but many more in Egypt, and especially at Alcair, where∣as in the market called Bain Elcasrain I saw one of these villaines with mine owne eies, in the presence of much people, deflowre a most beautifull wo∣man as she was comming foorth of the bath: which being done, the fond people came flocking about the said woman, striuing to touch her garment as a most holie thing: saying that the adulterer was a man of great sancti∣tie, and that he did not commit the sinne, but onely seemed to commit it:
<PB N="154" REF="114"/>
which when the sillie cuckold her husband vnderstood, he shewed himselfe thankfull to his false god with a solemne banket, and with liberall giuing of almes. The magistrates of the citie would haue punished the adulterer, but they were in hazard to be slaine of the people for their labours, who (as is be∣fore said) adore these varlets for saints and men of singular holines. Other more villanous actes I saw committed by them, which I am ashamed to re∣port.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Caballistes and certaine other sectes.</HEAD>
<P>LIkewise there is another sort of men, which we may fitly call Caballists. These fast most streitly, neither doe they eate the flesh of any liuing creature, but haue certaine meates and garments allotted vnto them: they rehearse likewise certaine set-praiers appointed for euery hower of the day and for the night, according to the varietie of daies and monethes, and they vse to carrie about certaine square tables with characters and numbers en∣grauen therein. They faine themselues to haue daily conference with the angels, of whom they learne (they say) the knowledge of all things. They had once a famous doctor of their sect called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> who was author of their ca∣nons, praiers, and square tables. Which when I saw, me thought their pro∣fession had more affinitie with magique then with Cabala. Their arte was diuided into eight partes; whereof the first was called <HI>Elumha Enormita,</HI> that is, the demonstration of light: the which contained praiers and fastings. The second called <HI>Semsul Meharif,</HI> that is, the sunne of sciences, contained the foresaid square tables, together with their vse and profit. The third part they call <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lasmei Elchusne;</HI> this part contained a catalogue of those 99. vertues, which (they say) are contained in the names of God, which I remember I saw at Rome in the custodie of a certaine Venetian Iew. They haue also a certaine other rule called <HI>Suvach,</HI> that is, the rule of heremites, the professors and followers whereof inhabite woods and solitarie places, neither haue they any other food, but such as those wilde deserts wil affoord: the conuersation of these heremites no man is able exactly to describe, be∣cause they are estranged from all humane societie. But if I should take vpon me to describe the varietie of Mahumetan sectes, I should digresse too farre from my present purpose. He that desireth to know more of this matter, let him read ouer the booke of <HI>Elefacni,</HI> who discourseth at large of the sectes<NOTE PLACE="marg">72. principall sectes in the religion of Mahumet.</NOTE> belonging to the Mahumetan religion, the principall whereof are 72. euery one of which defend their opinions to be true and good, and such as a man may attaine saluation by.

<P>MOreouer in the citie of Fez there are certaine men called <HI>Elcanesin,</HI> who supposing to finde treasure vnder the foundations of old houses, doe perpetually search and delue. These grosse fellowes vse to resort vnto certaine dennes and caues without the citie-walles, certainly perswading themselues, that when the Romans were chased out of Africa, and driuen into Baetica or Granada in Spaine, they hid great abundance of treasure in the bowels of the earth, which they could not carrie with them, and so en∣chanted the same by art-magique, that it can by no meanes be attained vnto but by the same arte; wherefore they seeke vnto inchanters to teach them the arte of digging vp the said treasures. Some of them there are that will stedfastly affirme, that they sawe gold in this or that caue: others, that they saw siluer, but could not digge it out, by reason that they were destitute of perfumes and enchantments fit for the purpose; so that being seduced with this vaine opinion, and deepely deluing into the earth, they turne vpside downe the foundations of houses and sepulchers, and sometimes they pro∣ceede in this manner ten or twelue daies iourney from Fez: yea so fond they are and so besotted, that they esteeme those bookes that professe the arte of digging gold, as diuine oracles. Before my departure from Fez these fanta∣sticall people had chosen them a consul, and getting licence of certaine ow∣ners to dig their grounds, when they had digged as much as they thought good, they paid the said owners for all dammages committed.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Alchymistes of Fez.</HEAD>
<P>IN this citie likewise there are great store of Alchymists which are migh∣tily addicted to that vaine practise: they are most base fellowes, and con∣taminate themselues with the steam of Sulphur, and other stinking smels. In the euening they vse to assemble themselues at the great temple, where they dispute of their false opinions. They haue of their arte of Alchymie many bookes written by learned men, amongst which one <HI>Geber</HI> is of principall account, who liued an hundred yeeres after Mahumet, and being a Greeke borne, is said to haue renounced his owne religion. This <HI>Geber</HI> his works and all his precepts are full of allegories or darke borrowed speeches. Likewise they haue another author, that wrote an huge volume of the same arte, inti∣tuled by the name of Attogrehi: this man was secretarie vnto the Soldan of Bagaded, of whom we haue written in the liues of the Arabian philosophers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A booke writ∣ten by Iohn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the liues of the Arabian philosophers.</NOTE> Also the songs or articles of the said science were written by one <HI>Mugairibi</HI> of Granada, whereupon a most learned Mamaluch of Damasco wrote a commentarie; yet so, that a man may much more easily vnderstand the text

Of Alchymistes here are two sorts; whereof the one seeke for the <HI>Elissir,</HI> that is, the matter which coloureth brasse and other metals; and the other are conuersant about multiplication of the quantities of metals, whereby they may conueniently temper the same. But their chiefest drift is to coine counterfeit money: for which cause you shall see most of them in Fez with their hands cut off.</P>

<HEAD>Of charmers andinchanters of snakes.</HEAD>
<P>IN this citie likewise there is a great swarme of base people, such as the Ita∣lians commonly call Ciurmatori: these sing foolish songs and rimes in all the streets of the citie, and broching meere trifles with the musicke of drums, harpes, and citterns, they sell vnto the rude people certaine scroules or briefe charmes instead of preseruatiues. Vnto these you may adde ano∣ther kinde of reffuse people of one family and disposition with the former, who carrie dauncing apes vp and downe, and haue their neckes and armes all entwined with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> snakes. These also professe Geomancie, and per∣swade women that they can foretell them their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Likewise they carrie stone-horses about with them, which for a certaine fee, they will let others haue to couer their mares. I coulde heere reckon vp more sorts of people; but let it suffice to haue admonished in this place, that the greatest part of the forenamed are people of most base condition, and such as beare little good will to strangers, albeit there are but a fewe in this citie, by reason it is distant more then an hundreth miles from the sea, the way thither also being rough and dangerous. Their gentle men are very stately and high minded, and will haue little or no familiaritie at all with the citizens: so likewise the doctors and iudges of principall account will admit but fewe vnto their acquain∣tance. This citie it selfe is most beautifull and right commodiously situate; where albeit in winter time the streetes are so mirie, that you cannot walke in them without startups, yet they let passe such abundance of water out of their conducts, that all the filth is washed cleane away. Where conducts are wanting, they carry all the durt in carts vnto the next part of the riuer.</P>

<HEAD>A description of the suburbes without the fore∣said citie of Fez.</HEAD>
<P>WIthout the wals of this citie westward standeth a suburbe containing almost fiue hundreth families, the houses whereof are but meane, and the inhabitants base, as namely driuers of camels, water-bearers, and cleauers of woode for the kings pallace. Yet here you may finde diuers shops, and all kinds of artificers. Here likewise dwell all the charmers and roguish minstrels before named; as also great swarmes of sluttish and filthie harlots. In the principall streete of this suburbe, you shall finde certaine caues most artificially hewen out of excellent marble, wherein the noble
<PB N="157" REF="115"/>
men of Fez were woont to lay vp their corne: but after that by reason of the warres it was often taken from thence, they haue since vsually conueied their corne into new Fez, and there stored it vp: and from that time to this the marble-caues haue remained desolate. It is a woonder to see howe wide and large these caues are; for the least of them will containe more then a thousand measures of corne, there being aboue an hundreth and fiftie of them in all, but now they lie waste and open, insomuch that diuers fall into them at vnawares, for which cause their brimmes are enuironed with wals. Here euery one may play the vintener and the baud; so that this suburbe may iustly be called the sinke of Fez. From the twentith hower you shall see none at all in their shops: for then euery man runs to the tauerne to disport, to spend riotously, and to bee drunken. Another suburbe there is allotted vnto the lepers, of whom there are two hundreth families: these leprous per∣sons<NOTE PLACE="marg">The habitation of lepers in Fez and their go∣uernour.</NOTE> haue a gouernour, which gathereth certaine yeerely reuenues from the noble-men, and taketh such care of the saide lepers, that they want no neces∣sarie thing. He is bound by his office to discharge the citie of all leprous persons, and to compell all such as he vnderstandes to be infected with that disease, to depart into the foresaide suburbes. If any leper chanceth to die without issue, part of his goods are emploied to the common benefite of the lepers, and part fall to the gouernours share: but if he hath any children, they enioy his goods. Among the lepers also those are placed, which are in∣fected with white botches, or with any other incurable maladie. Next be∣yond standeth another suburbe inhabited onely with muleters, plaisterers, and wood-mongers: which although it be but little, yet containeth it about an hundreth and fiftie families. Moreouer vpon the way leading westward from the citie there is another great suburbe of moe then fower hundreth houses: howbeit they are low &amp; base, and the inhabitants are beggerly, which neither can nor will dwell among any other people. By this suburbe there is a certaine broad plaine which leadeth to the riuer two miles off, and exten∣deth westward almost three miles. Vpon this plaine euery weeke there is an exceeding great market of cattell. Likewise the shopkeepers of the citie re∣sort hither and sell their wares in tents. Also a certaine companie of gentle∣men vse to come hither, and to diuide a ramme among themselues, leauing the head vnto the butcher for his fee, but the feete and the skin they sell vn∣to the wooll-chapmen. For those wares that are heere sold they pay so little tribute to the king, that it is not woorth the mentioning. But this one thing I must in no wise passe ouer in silence, namely, that I neuer sawe neither in Asia, Africa, nor Italy, a market either more populous, or better furnished with wares. Not farre from Fez stand certaine high rockes enuironed with a ditch of two miles compasse, out of which rockes certaine matter is hewed to make lime withall. Neere vnto the saide ditch are many furnaces, some whereof are so large, that they will containe moe then sixe thousand mea∣sures of lime: and this lime is made at the costes of the richest citizens in Fez. Westward without the wals of Fez by the riuers side stande about an hun∣dred
<PB N="158" REF="116"/>
cottages, which are onely inhabited by them that white linnen cloth. Hither in the spring and in summer vse the citizens to bring their linnen cloth, spreading it vpon the medowes, and as often as they see it drie in the sunne, casting water thereupon, which water they fetch either out of the ri∣uer or out of some cesterne in certaine lether tankards made for the same purpose: but at night each one carrieth his cloth into the foresaid cottages. Neither are the medowes wherein they bleach their cloth euer destitute of grasse. A most gallant prospect it is to beholde a farre off the white clothes dispersed ouer the greene medow, and the christall streames of the riuer, which seeme to be of an azure hue, running along: all which the Poets haue celebrated in their verses.</P>

When any noble man or any principall citizen deceaseth, they lay one stone ouer his head and ano∣ther ouer his feete, whereon vseth to bee engrauen some epitaph, with the day and yeere when the partie deceased. I my selfe bestowed much labour in gathering of epitaphes, which I sawe both about Fez and in other places of Barbary; all which being set downe in a booke I gaue vnto the kings brother.

<HEAD>A description of their gardens.</HEAD>
<P>WIthout the north, east, and south parts of the citie are great store of gardens, replenished with all kinde of fruite and with stately trees. Through the midst of these garden̄s, they deriue some small vaine of the riuer, some whereof are so full of trees, that you woulde take them for groues rather then for gardens. These gardens they manure not at all, but only water them continually in the moneth of May, whereupon they haue great abun∣dance of fruit. All their fruits, saue their peaches onely, are of a most deli∣cate taste, whereof, so soone as they are ripe, aboue fiue hundreth cart-loades are daily carried into the market, besides grapes, which here I do not men∣tion.
<PB N="159" REF="116"/>
But the saide fruits are carried vnto a certaine place in Fez, where tri∣bute being paide for them, they are solde by criers vnto the fruiterers there present. In the same place likewise after paying of tribute, they sell certaine Negro-slaues. Towards the east of Fez lieth a plaine fifteene miles broad, and thirtie miles long: this plaine is full of fountaines and freshets, and is reserued for the vse of the great temple. It is farmed out vnto gardiners, who sowe thereupon such abundance of hemp, melons, turneps or nauewes, radish, and other such like rootes and herbes, that euery summer there are saide to be gathered thereof aboue fifteene thousand cart-loads, and as many in winter.

<HEAD>Of that part of Fez which is called new Fez.</HEAD>
<P>NEW Fez beeing enuironed with an high and impregnable wall, and situate on a most beautifull plaine not farre from the riuers side, is al∣most a mile distant from old Fez, and that vpon the east and south side there∣of. Betweene the wals of either towne, to the northward, entereth a certaine arme of the riuer, where the foresaid milles do stande, and the other part of the riuer is seuered into two branches, one whereof runneth betweene new Fez and old Fez, not farre from the edge of the rocke, and the other passing through certaine vallies and gardens, trendeth at length southward. The other part of the riuer holdeth on his course by the rocke, and so by the col∣lege of king <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Aburi∣nan.</NOTE> <HI>Abutiman.</HI> This citie of new Fez <HI>Iacob</HI> the sonne of <HI>Abdul∣tach</HI> caused to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> built, who was the first king of the Marin family, and expelled the kings of Maroco, and vsurped the kingdome vnto himselfe: but<NOTE PLACE="marg">The founder of new Fez.</NOTE> the king of Telensin, to the end he might make the people of Maroco be∣holding vnto him, and might subuert the prosperous successe of the Marin family, went about to hinder the king of Fez his attempts against Maroco: wherefore king <HI>Iacob</HI> hauing finished the wars of Maroco, determined to re∣uenge himselfe to the vttermost for the iniuries offered by them of Telensin. But considering with himselfe, that the strong townes of his owne king∣dome were farre distant from Telensin, he thought it a better course to builde this citie, whereunto the seate roiall of all Maroco might be transla∣ted: which being erected, he called The white citie, but it was afterward na∣med by the inhabitants new Fez. This citie king <HI>Iacob</HI> the founder diui∣ded into three parts, whereof the first contained his roiall pallace, and di∣uers noble mens houses, vnto euery one of which he allotted a most plea∣sant garden. Not farre from his pallace he built a most stately and sumptu∣ous temple. In another part of this citie he built a large and faire stable for the kings horses to stande in. Then also he caused other palaces to be erec∣ted for his captaines and principall courtiers. From the west gate to the east he appointed the market place, the distance betweene which gates is a mile and an halfe, and on both sides he placed artificers and merchants shops. At
<PB N="160" REF="117"/>
the west gate he caused a faire portall to be set vp, to harbour the watchmen and warders of the citie. Not far from thence he erected two stables suffici∣ent to containe three hundreth horses, which he might vse for the protection of his owne palace. The third part of the citie was appointed for the kinges guarde and attendants, which were most of them borne eastwarde of Fez, neither had they any other weapons but hand-bowes (for crosse-bowes were not then vsed in that kingdome) vnto which attendants the king al∣lowed a large stipend: but now the same place is full of beautifull temples and stoues. Neere vnto the kings palace standes the mint, hauing in the midst a fower-square court with certaine portals or cels rounde about it, wherein the money-minters dwell. Likewise there is another lodging in the midst of the same court, where the gouernor of the mint with his scribes and notaries haue their aboad. Here, as well as in any other places, whatsoeuer commoditie is raised, redoundeth wholy to the king. Neere vnto the mint stande the gold-smiths shops, whose Consul or gouernour keepes the seale and stamps of the coine. In Fez neither ring nor any other Iewell or com∣moditie can bee made of siluer or golde, before the metall bee sealed, for the offenders are most seuerely punished. And, the metall being sealed, whatsoeuer is made thereof is weighed as if it were money. The greatest part of goldsmiths dwelling in new Fez are Iewes, who carrie their vessels of gold and siluer vnto a certaine place of old Fez, neere vnto the grocers shops, and there sell them. For in old Fez neither gold nor siluer is coined, nor any Mahumetans are suffered to be goldsmiths, bicause they haue vsurers among them, which will sell any peece of wrought siluer or golde deerer then the weight requireth; albeit the same priuilege is by the gouernours of the citie granted vnto the Iewes. Some there are also that onely make plate for the citizens, who are paied hire onely for their worke. That part of the citie which the kings attendants or guard once possessed, is now inhabited by Iewes: for now a daies the kings vse no such guard. The Iewes indeed first dwelt in old Fez, but vpon the death of a certaine king they were all robbed by the Moores: whereupon king <HI>Abusabid</HI> caused them to remooue into new Fez, and by that meanes doubled their yeerely tribute. They therefore euen till this day doe occupie a long street in the said new citie, wherin they haue their shops and synagogues, and their number is maruellously encrea∣sed euer since they were driuen out of Spaine. These Iewes are had in great contempt by all men, neither are any of them permitted to weare shooes, but they make them certaine socks of sea-rushes. On their heads they weare a blacke <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Orturbant.</NOTE> dulipan, and if any will goe in a cap, he must fasten a red cloth thereunto. They pay vnto the king of Fez monethly fower hundred duckats. At length within the space of an hundred and forty yeeres this new citie was enuironed with most impregnable walles, and adorned with temples, colle∣ges, palaces, and other such buildings as serue to beautifie a citie, so that I<NOTE PLACE="marg">Engins for the conueiance of water.</NOTE> thinke there was more bestowed in garnishing of the citie, then in building of the walles. Without the citie-walles are built many huge wheeles or en∣gins,
<PB N="161" REF="117"/>
for the conueying of riuer-water ouer the said walles into cesternes, from whence it is conueied in certaine chanels and pipes vnto the temples, gardens, &amp; palaces. The said wheeles were built not fully an hundred yeeres past, before which time water was brought vnto the citie by a certaine con∣duct, from a fountaine ten miles distant. Of which artificiall conduct a cer∣taine Genouese, beeing then in great fauour with the king, is reported to haue been the author: but the wheeles (they say) were inuented by a Spani∣ard: and in them there is maruellous cunning workmanship: for to the conueiance of so huge a quantitie of water, each wheele is turned about but fower and twentie times onely in a day and a night. To conclude, here are but few gentlemen in this citie, except such as attend vpon the court, for the residue are base and mechanicall people: but such as carie any shew of ho∣nestie, doe so hate and disdaine the kings courtiers and gentlemen, that they will by no meanes vouchsafe to marie their daughters vnto them.</P>

<HEAD>Of the fashions and customes vsed in the kings court.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst all the princes of Africa, I neuer red of any that was created by the common suffrages and consent of the people vnto his king∣dome or princedome, or that was called from any strange prouince or citie to beare rule. Also by the law of Mahumet no man may beare any secular authoritie, which may be called lawfull, saue onely the Mahumetan patri∣arkes and prelates: howbeit the saide patriarkes authoritie decreasing daily more and more, the ringleaders of such people as ranged vp and downe the deserts began to inuade places inhabited &amp; ciuilized, and by force of armes, against Mahumets lawe, and maugre his prelates, to ordaine sundrie prin∣ces: As for example in the East, whereas the Turkes, Cordians, and Tar∣tars, haue vsurped dominion ouer such as were not able to repell them. So likewise in the west parts first the families of Zeneta and Luntuna, then the seditious Mahumetan preachers, and afterward the family of Marin got the vpper hand. Howbeit the family of Luntuna is reported to haue aided the western regions, &amp; to haue released them from the furie of the seditious heretiques, wherein they shewed themselues friends and not enimies: but afterward their tyrannie began to shew it selfe. And this is the reason why they do not now a daies attaine vnto gouernment by hereditarie sućcession or by election of the people, or of the nobilitie. But the prince himselfe when he feeles death seazing vpon him, calleth about him all his peeres and nobles, and bindeth them by oath, to establish his sonne, brother, or anie other whom he most fauoureth, in his kingdome. But they after the prin∣ces decease neglecting their oath, will chuse any other whom they list. And this is ordinarily the election of the king of Fez, who, so soone as he is pro∣claimed king, chuseth foorthwith some one of his nobles to be his chiefe counsellour, and on him he bestoweth the thirde part of all his kingly reue∣nues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of choosing officers in the court of Fez.</NOTE> Then chuseth another to be his secretarie, treasurer, and high steward of his houshold. Then is created the captaine of the horsemen appointed
<PB N="162" REF="118"/>
for the kings guard, and these horsemen with their horses liue most com∣monly in the fieldes. Lastly he appointeth a new gouernour ouer euery ci∣tie, vnto whom all the tributes and reuenues of the same place redound, with condition, that as often as any warres betide, he shall maintaine a certaine companie of horses to the kings seruice. After a while also he placeth cer∣taine deputies and commissioners ouer his people inhabiting the moun∣taines, and ouer the Arabians subiect vnto him. The gouernours of cities diuersly administer iustice, according to the custome of the place. Some there are also appointed by the king to collect all the tributes and reuenues of his kingdome, and duly to paie the same vnto him. Likewise there are others chosen, whom they call in their language keepers or guardians, and vnto euery one of these the king giueth some castle or village, whereby he may procure his owne maintenance, and be able to serue the king in time of warre. Moreouer the king of Fez maintaineth a troupe of light horse∣men, who so long as they serue the king in his campe, haue their diet allo∣wed them out of the kings prouision: but in time of peace, he findeth them corne, butter, and pouldered flesh for the whole yeere, but money they haue very seldome. Once a yeere they are apparelled at the kings cost; neither do they prouide for their horses either within the citie or without, for the king furnisheth them with all necessaries. Those that giue attendance to their horses are Christian captiues, which go shackled in great chaines and fetters. But when the armie remooueth any whither, the saide Christians are carried vpon camels backes. Another officer there is that giueth atten∣dance onely to the camels, assigning certaine pastures vnto the heards-men, and diuiding fields among them, and making such prouision for the kings camels, as himselfe shall thinke expedient. Each camel-driuer hath two ca∣mels, which are laden with the kings furniture, according to the appoint∣ment of the gouernour. Likewise the king hath a certaine purueiour or ste∣ward, whose office is to prouide, keepe, and distribute corne both to the kings houshold and to his armie. This man in time of warre hath tenne or twelue tents to lay vp corne in, and euery day with change of camels he sen∣deth for newe corne, least the armie shoulde be vnprouided of victuals: he hath also cooks at his command. Moreouer there is a gouernour or master∣groome of the stables, who prouideth for the kings horses, mules, and ca∣mels, and is furnished with all necessaries by the steward. There is another also appointed ouerseer of the corne, whose dutie it is to prouide barly and other prouender for the beasts: and this man hath his scribes and notaries about him, who diligently set downe all particular expenses, for they must giue vp a perfect account vnto the chiefe steward. They haue also a certaine captaine ouer fiftie horsemen, which horsemen may well be called purse∣uants, for they are sent by the secretarie in the kings name to do his busines. Likewise the Fezzan king hath another captaine of great name, being as it were gouernour of his guard, who in the kings name, may compell the iudges to do iustice, and to put their sentences in execution. This mans
<PB N="163" REF="118"/>
authoritie is so great, that sometimes he may commit principal noblemen to ward, &amp; may seuerely punish them, according to the kings commandement. Moreouer the said king hath a most trusty chancelor, who keepeth the great seale, and writeth and signeth the kings letters. He hath also a great number of footemen, the gouernour of whom accepteth and dismisseth whom he thinkes good, and giueth to euery one wages according to his agilitie and desert. And whensoeuer the king commeth in place of iudgement, the saide gouernour alwaies attendeth vpon him, and is in a manner his high cham∣berlain. Also there is another that taketh charge of the carriages and bag∣gage of the armie, and causeth the tents of the light horsemen to be carried vp and downe on mules, and the tents of the other soldiers on camels. There are likewise a company of ensigne-bearers, who in marching on a iourney carrie their colours wrapped vp: but he that goeth before the armie hath his banner displaied, and of a great height. And euery one of the saide standard∣bearers knoweth most exactly alwaies, fords of riuers, and passages through woods, wherefore they are for the most part appointed to guide the armie. The drummers (of whom there are great store in the kings host) plaie vpon certaine drums of brasse as bigge as a great kettle, the lower part whereof is narrow, &amp; the vpper broad, being couered with a skin. These drummers ride on horsebacke, hauing alwaies on the one side of their horses a great waight hanging downe, to counterpoize the heauines of their drums on the other side. They are allowed most swift horses, bicause the Moores account it a great disgrace to loose a drum. The said drums make such a loude and horri∣ble noise, that they are not onely heard a farre off, but also strike exceeding terrour both vpon men and horses, and they are beaten onely with a buls pizzle. The musitions are not maintained at the kings charge, for the cities are bounde at their costs to send a certaine number of them to the warres, who, according to their demeanour in the warres, are admitted or not ad∣mitted vnto the kings table. This king hath also a certaine master of cere∣monies, who sitteth at his feete in the senate-house, and commandeth each man to sit downe, and to speake according to his dignitie. All the maide∣seruants in the kings familie are Negro-slaues, which are partly chamber∣lains, and partly waiting-maids. And yet his Queene is alwaies of a white skin. Likewise in the king of Fez his court are certaine Christian captiues, being partly Spanish, and partly Portugale women, who are most circum∣spectly kept by certaine Eunuchs, that are Negro-slaues. The king of Fez hath very large dominions, but his reuenues are small, to wit, scare three hundreth thousand ducats, the fift part whereof redoundeth not to the king: for the remainder is diuided into sundrie portions, as we haue before signi∣fied. Yea, the greater part of the said reuenues is paide in corne, cattle, oile, and butter, all which yeeld but small store of money. In some place they pay a ducate and one fourth part, tribute for euery acre, but in other places a whole family paieth but so much. In some other regions each man aboue fifteene yeeres of age paieth as much tribute also. Neither are the people
<PB N="164" REF="119"/>
of this great citie more vexed with any thing then with paying of their tri∣butes and impositions. Heere also is to be noted, that the Mahumetan go∣uernours (the priests onely excepted) may not exact greater reuenues then those that Mahumet hath allotted vnto them, namely of euery of their sub∣iects which possesseth 100. ducates in ready money, they are to haue two du∣cates &amp; an halfe for yeerely tribute. Euery husbandman likewise is bound to pay for tribute the tenth part of all his corne. And all the saide tributes he appointed to be paied vnto the patriarke, who should bestow that which was superfluous for the Prince to haue, vpon common vses; namely for the re∣leeuing of poore impotent people and widowes, and for maintaining of wars against the enimie. But since the Patriarches began to decay, the Prin∣ces (as we haue beforesaide) exercised tyrannie. For it was not sufficient for them to exact all the forenamed tributes, and riotously to consume the same, but also to vrge people vnto greater contributions; so that all the inhabitants of Africa are so oppressed with daily exactions, that they haue scarcely wherewithall to feed and apparell themselues: for which cause there is almost no man of learning or honesty, that will seeke any acquaintance with courtiers, or will inuite them to his table, or accept any gifts (bee they neuer so pretious) at their hands: thinking that whatsoeuer goods they haue, are gotten by theft and briberie.

When he wa∣geth<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the king of Fez rideth on progresse.</NOTE> warre against the Arabians that be his enemies, because the forenamed garison is not sufficient, he requireth ayde of the Arabians his subiects, who at their owne costs finde him a great armie of men better trained to the warres, then his owne souldiers before-mentioned. The pompe and cere∣monies of this king are but meane, neither doth he willingly vse them, but onely vpon festiuall daies, and when meere necessitie requireth. When the king is to ride foorth, the master of ceremonies signifieth so much vnto cer∣taine herbengers or postes, whereupon the herbengers giue notice there∣of vnto the kings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or kines folkes.</NOTE>parents, vnto his nobilitie, his senatours, captaines, guardians, and gentlemen, who presently arrange themselues before the palace gate. At the kings comming foorth of the palace, the herbengers appoint vnto each man his place and order of riding. First and foremost go the standard-bearers, next the drummers, then followeth the chiefe groome of the stable with his seruants and family; after him comes the kings pensio∣ners, his guard, his master of ceremonies, his secretaries, his treasurer, and last of all his chiefe Iudge and his captaine generall, at length comes the king accompanied with his principall counseller, or with some other great peere. Before the king also ride certaine officers belonging to his person, whereof one carries his sword-royall, another his shield, and the third his crosse-bowe. On each side of him march his footemen, one carrying a payer

of stirrups, another the kings partizan, the third a couering for his saddle, and the fourth a halter for his horse. And so soone as the king is dismoun∣ted, they foorthwith couer his saddle, and put the foresaide halter vpon his horse-head. Likewise there is another footeman that carrieth the kings pan∣tofles most artificially wrought. After the king followeth the captaine of the footemen, then the eunuches, the kings family, the light horsemen, and last of all the crosse-bowes and Harquebusiers. The apparell of the king is then verie moderate and plaine: insomuch that if a man knew him not, he would thinke him to be absent: for the attendants be far more sumptuously attired.

At euerie of the fower corners standeth a little sharpe turret made of cloth, with a gallant spheare on the top which glistereth like gold. This royall pauilion hath fower gates, euerie one of which is kept by eunuches. Within the said pauilion are con∣tained diuers other tents, among which is the kings lodging, being framed in such wise, that it may easily be remooued from place to place. Next vnto it stand the tents of the noblemen, and of such as are most in the kings fa∣uour; then the lodgings of the principall guard beeing made of goates∣skinnes, after the Arabian fashion; and in the middest of all stands the kings kitchin and his pantrie. Not farre from hence the light horsemen haue their aboade, who all of them are victualled out of the kings storehouse, notwith∣standing their attire be verie base. Next of all are the stables, wherein their horses are maruellous well tended. Without this circuit keepe such as car∣rie the tents and the kings furniture from place to place. Here are also but∣chers, victuallers, and such like. All merchants &amp; artificers that resort hither, take vp their aboad next vnto the tent-carriers: so that the kings pauilion is pitched like a strong citie, for it is so enuironed with the lodgings of the guarde, and with other tents adioining, that there is very difficult passage to the king. Round about the saide roiall pauilion, there are certaine appointed to watch and ward all night long, howbeit they are base and vnarmed people. In like sort there is a watch kept about the stables, but sometimes so negli∣gently, that not onely some horses haue beene stolne, but there haue beene founde enimies in the kings owne pauilion, that came to murther him. The king liueth the greatest part of the yeere in the fieldes, both for the safegard of his kingdome, and also that he may keepe his Arabian subiects in obedi∣ence, and sometimes he recreateth himselfe with hunting, and sometime with playing at chesse. I know right well how tedious I haue beene in the de∣scription of this citie: but bicause it is the metropolitan not onely of Bar∣bary, but of all Africa, I thought good most particularly to decypher euerie parcell and member thereof.</P>

Then answered <HI>Mansor:</HI> what hast thou to doe with the kings life or safetie? Marie (quoth the fisher) I am bound to loue the king as well as mine owne life. Then haue you obtained some singular benefite at his hands, said the king. What greater benefit (quoth the fisher) can be expected at the kings hand, then iustice, loue, and clemencie, which he vouchsafeth vnto his sub∣iects; by whose fauour and wisedome I sillie fisher with my poore wife and children liue a most quiet and contented life, so that I can euen at midnight haue free egresse and regresse vnto this my cottage amidst these vallies and desert fennes, no man lying in wait to doe me iniurie?

Then the king went vnto the fishers cottage, where after his horse was prouided for, the fisher caused some eeles to be rosted for his supper, while he sate drying of his garments by the fire: but the king not being con∣tented with this fare, demanded if his host had any flesh in the house: Sir (quoth he) I haue a shee-goate and a kid, and they are all my substance of cattell: but because by your countenance you seeme to be some honourable personage, I will aduenture my kid for your sake; and so without any more words he caused his wife to kill it &amp; roste it.

The English hauing good successe tooke the citie, and so wasted it with fire and sword, that scarce one citizen escaped, so that it remained almost thirtie yeeres voide of inhabitants. But afterward when the Mahumetan patriarks of Cordoua were lords of Mauri∣tania, it was againe reedified, and by all meanes augmented, enriched and fortified. The inhabitants were rich, learned, and valiant. The fields adiacent yeeld graine and pulse of all sorts in great abundance, but because the towne standeth almost ten miles from the mountaines, it sustaineth great want of wood; howbeit they haue coales brought them from Harais, as is aforesaid.

It hath alwaies beene a ciuill, famous, and well-peopled towne, and very stately and sumptuously built.

It was well stored with inhabitants, till such time as Arzilla was surprized by the Portugals: for then the inhabitants be∣ing dismaied with rumours of warres, tooke vp their bag and baggage and fled vnto Fez. Whereupon the king of Portugall his deputie at Arzilla sent one of his captaines thither, who kept it so long vnder the obedience of the king, till the king of Fez sent one of his kinsmen also to defend a region of great importance neere vnto the mountaines of Gumera, being enemie to the Christians. Twentie fiue yeeres before the Portugall king wan this ci∣tie, he sent foorth an armada against it, hoping that the citie being destitute of aide, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> king of Fez was in warres against the rebels of Mecnase, would soone yeeld it selfe.

<P>THis mountaine is of an exceeding height, and very hard to be encoun∣tred: for besides the naturall fortification thereof, it is inhabited with most valiant people. These inhabitants being oppressed with the tyran∣nie of their gouernours, rose vp at length in armes against them, &amp; brought them to great miserie and distresse. Whereupon a yoong gentleman, one of their said gouernours, disdaining to submit himselfe vnto the yoke of his inferiours, went to serue in the king of Granada his warres, where being trai∣ned vp a long time in martiall discipline against the Christians, he prooued an expert warriour: and so at length returning vnto one of his natiue moun∣taines, he gathered a certaine troupe of horsemen, and valiantly defended the said mountaine from the Portugals inuasions: whereof the king of Fez

<P>THis ancient towne built vpon the Mediterran sea shore, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Spaniards <HI>Velles de Gumera,</HI> containeth about sixe hundred families. Some writers there are that affirme it to be built by the Africans, and others by the Gothes; so that it re∣maineth as yet vncertaine who were the true founders therof. It standeth betweene two high mountaines: and not farre from it there is a faire and large valley, from whence commeth a little riuer or streame to the towne, alwaies when it raineth. In the midst of the towne standeth the mar∣ket place, which containeth great store of shops. Here is also a verie stately temple to be seene. Water for drinke is exceeding scarce among them, for they are all constrained to resort vnto one pit or well, being in the sub∣urbes, neere vnto the sepulchre of a certaine man, that was in times past very famous among them. Howbeit in the night it is dangerous to fetch water from thence, because it is so full of blood-suckers or horse-leeches. The townesmen are of two sorts: for some be fishers, and the residue are pirates, which daily doe great harme vnto the Christians. Vpon the mountaines grow great store of wood, verie commodious for the building of ships and of galleies. The inhabitants of which mountaines are almost wholly em∣ployed about carrying of the said wood from place to place. They haue very little corne growing, for which cause most of them eate barley bread. Their principall foode are certaine fishes (which the Italians call <HI>Sardelli</HI>) toge∣ther with other like fishes. They haue such abundance of fish, that one man alone is not able to draw vp a net; wherefore whosoeuer will assist the fishermen in that busines, are rewarded with good store of fishes for their labour: yea sometimes they will freely bestow fishes vpon such as passe by. They salt the foresaid Sardelli, and send them to the mountaines to be sold. In this towne there is a long street inhabited with Iewes, wherin dwell sundry vintners that sell excellent wines. So that in calme euenings the citi∣zens vse to carrie wine aboord their barkes in the sea, and to spend their time in drinking and singing. In this towne standeth a faire castle, but not strong, wherein the gouernour hath his aboad. And neere vnto this castle the saide gouernour hath a palace, whereunto belongeth a most pleasant garden. Vpon the shore the gouernour buildeth galleies and other ships wherewith they greatly molest the Christians. Whereupon <HI>Ferdinando</HI> king of Spaine taking a certaine Iland within a mile of the towne, built a fort there∣on, and so planted it with ordinance and souldiers, that neither their temples nor themselues walking in the streets were free therefrom, but were daily slaine. Wherefore the gouernour of the towne was constrained to craue ayde from the king of Fez, who sent out a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against the Christi∣ans; but they were partly taken, and partly slaine, so that verie few escaped backe vnto Fez. The Christians kept this isle almost two yeeres: and then

it was betrayed by a false trecherous Spaniard (who slew the gouernour of the isle, because he had taken his wife from him) into the Moores possession, and all the Christians were slaine: not a man of them escaped, saue onely the Spanish traitour, who in regard of his treason was greatly rewarded, both by the gouernour of Bedis, and also by the king of Fez. Being at Naples I heard the whole relation of this matter from a certaine man that was present at all the former exploits, who said that they were done about the yeere of our Lord 1520. But now the said island is most diligently kept by a garrison of souldiers sent from Fez: for Bedis is the neerest hauen-towne vnto Fez vpon the Mediterran sea shore, although it be an hundred and twenty miles distant.

But what if he should come hither (saith <HI>Ma∣humet</HI>) to submit himselfe, and to acknowledge his offence; might it then please the king to admit him into fauour?

<HEAD>Of the citie of Teza or Tezza.</HEAD>
<P>THis great, noble, and rich citie of Tezza was built by the Africans, fiue miles from mount Atlas, being distant from Fez fiftie, from the Oce∣an an hundred and thirtie, and from the Mediterran sea seuen miles, and standing in the way from Garet to Chasasan. It contained in times past about fiue thousand families: the buildings of this towne are not very state∣ly, except noblemens palaces, colleges, and temples, which are somewhat beautifull. Out of Atlas springeth a little riuer which runneth through the chiefe temple of this citie: and sometimes it falleth out, that certaine peo∣ple bordering vpon the citie, vpon some quarrell with the citizens will cut off this riuer from the citie, and turne the course thereof some other way, which breedeth great inconueniences vnto the citizens: for then they can neither builde houses, nor get any water to drinke, but onely corrupt water which they take out of certaine cesterns, for which cause they are often con∣strained to make a league with those borderers. This citie both for wealth, ciuilitie, and abundance of people is the thirde citie of all the kingdome, and hath a greater temple then that at Fez: heere are likewise three colleges, with diuers bath-stoues, and a great number of hospitals. Each trade and occupation hath a seuerall place in this citie, like as they haue in Fez: the in∣habitants are of a more valiant and liberall disposition, then they of Fez: heere are also great store of learned and rich men: and the fieldes adiacent are exceeding fruitfull. Without the citie wals are verie large plaines, and many pleasant streames, that serue to water their gardens which are repleni∣shed with all kinde of fruits: heere are abundance of vines also yeelding ve∣rie sweete grapes, whereof the Iewes (being fiue hundreth families) make excellent wine, such as I thinke all Africa scarce affoordeth better. In this
<PB N="205" REF="139"/>
towne standeth a faire castle, where the gouernour hath his abode. The king of Fez assigned the gouerment of this towne vnto his second sonne, being rather a meete place for the kings owne residence, in regard of the whole∣fome aire both in sommer and winter: heere were the nobles of the Marin∣family woont to remaine all summer, both in respect of the holesomenes of the place, and also that they might defend those regions from the Arabians dwelling in the deserts: which Arabians resorted yeerely to Tezza, to the end they might there furnish themselues with victuals and other necessa∣ries, and brought dates thither from Segelmese to exchange for come: the citizens also receiued of the Arabians for corne great summes of money, whereupon all of them in a manner grow exceeding rich, neither are they annoied so much with any inconuenience, as with durtie streetes in winter. I my selfe was acquainted in this citie with a certaine aged sire, whom the townesmen adored as if he had beene a god: he was maruelous rich both in fruits, grounds, and other commodities, which the people bestowed vpon him in great abundance. The citizens of Fez vsed to come fiftie miles (for so farre is Fez distant) onely to visite the saide olde man. My selfe concei∣ued some great opinion of this aged sire: but after I had seene him, I could finde no such superexcellencie in him, saue onely that he deluded the fonde people with strange deuises.

These people are most va∣liant warriours, for they will fight euen to the last gaspe, rather then be taken of their enemies: they carrie fower or fiue iauelins about with them, where∣with they know right well how to defend themselues from the enemie. They fight alwaies on foote, neither can they be vanquished but with a great num∣ber of horsemen, and they vse to carrie swords and daggers with them also. In my time they obtained safe conduct of the Arabians, and the Arabians of them likewise, which was a cause, that the merchants of both partes tra∣uelled more securely.</P>

<P>THis ancient towne was built by the Africans at the foote of one of the foresaid mountaines, not farre from the riuer of Ziz. It is enuironed with an impregnable and stately wall, the founder whereof was a certaine king of the Marin-familie. In regard of the walles and bulwarks it is a most beautifull towne. But being once entred thereinto, you shall see most base and beggerly houses, and scarce any inhabitants dwelling in them, and that by the iniurie of certaine Arabians, who when they reuolted from the Ma∣rin-familie, tooke this towne and grieuously oppressed the citizens. Their drie and barren fields lie open to the north. Vpon the riuer are diuers mils, and by the side thereof are many gardens replenished with grapes and pea∣ches, which they vse to drie in the sunne, and to keepe an whole yeere. They haue great scarcitie of cattell, which causeth them to liue a most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> life. This towne was built by the familie of Zeneta in stead of a fort, to the end it might be a place of refuge onely in their iournie to Numidia, but af∣terward it was surprised and vtterly destroied by the familie of Luntuna.

<P>THis kingdome beginneth westward from the ri∣uers of Zha &amp; Muluia, eastward it bordereth vp∣on The great riuer, southward vpon the desert of Numidia, and northward vpon the Mediter∣ran sea. This region was called by the Romanes Caesaria, and was by them inhabited: howbeit after the Romanes were expelled, it was ful∣lie possessed by the ancient gouernours there∣of called Beni Habdulguad, and being a gene∣ration of the familie of Magraua. And it remained vnto them and their suc∣cessors three hundred yeeres, vntill such time as a certaine mightie man cal∣led <HI>Ghamrazen</HI> the sonne of <HI>Zeijen</HI> tooke possession thereof. His posteritie changing at length their ancient name were called <HI>Beni Zeijen,</HI> that is, the sonnes of <HI>Zeijen:</HI> and they enioied this kingdome for the space almost of 380. yeeres. At length the kings of Fez of the Marin-familie greatly mole∣sted them, so that those ten kings which succeeded <HI>Zeijen</HI> were some of them vnfortunate in battell, some slaine, some taken captiue, and others ex∣pelled their kingdome, and chased to the next mountaines. Neither were they free from vexation of the kings of Tunis: howbeit the kingdome of Telensin remained still to this familie, and they continued in peace for al∣most an hundred and twentie yeeres, being endammaged by no forren pow∣er; sauing that one <HI>Abu Feris</HI> king of Tunis, and his sonne <HI>Hutmen</HI> made them to pay tribute for certaine yeeres vnto Tunis, till the decease of the said <HI>Hutmen.</HI> This kingdome stretcheth in length from east to west 380. miles, but in bredth from north to south, that is, from the Mediterran sea to the deserts of Numidia not aboue fiue and twentie miles: which is the occa∣sion that it is so often oppressed by the Arabians inhabiting the Numidian deserts. The kings of Telensin haue alwaies endeuoured by great gifts to gaine the good will and friendship of the Numidians, but they could neuer satisfie their insatiable couetice.

Heretofore being subiect vnto the kings of Telensin it well deserued the name of a citie, but since the Arabians got pos∣session thereof, it hath prooued more like to a stable: for here they keepe their corne onely, and the naturall inhabitants are quite expelled by reason of their bad demeanour.</P>

Howbeit a few yeeres after it began to be inhabited anew by certaine religious per∣sons had in great reuerence both by the kings of Telensin and by all the Arabians. These religious persons with great courtesie and liberalitie giue entertainment for three daies vnto all strangers that passe by, and then dis∣misse them without paying of ought. All their houses are very base and low built, their walles being of claye, and the roofes of straw.

In times past the towne-walles and all the buildings were most sumptuous and stately, and the inhabitants exceeding rich, ciuill, and valiant: but afterward by reason of certaine warres waged by the king of Fez against the king of Telensin, this towne was left desolate, and the inhabitants all put to flight: but the said warres being en∣ded,

The historiographers of those times report, that this towne was in all respects built after the fashion of Rome, whereupon they say it borrowed the name. For <HI>Ned</HI> in the Arabian toong signifieth like. The wall of this towne is as yet to be seene: but all the ancient buildings of the Romans are so destroied, that now there scarcely remaine any ruines there∣of. It began in some places to be repaired and reedified anew, but nothing comparable to the former buildings. The fieldes adiacent are exceeding fruitfull, and containe many gardens replenished with such trees as beare Carobs (being a fruit like vnto <HI>Cassia fistula</HI>) which in the suburbes they vse for foode. This towne is indifferently well inhabited, especially with wea∣uers, who make great store of cotton-cloth, and are free from all tribute.

Being in continuall feare of the Christians, they keepe euery night most diligent watch and ward: for they are not of sufficient abilitie to maintaine a garrison of soldiers.

The towne-wall also is very high and beautifull, especially on that side which standeth next vnto the sea. Hither doe the Ve∣netians yeerely bring great store of merchandize, and doe traffique with the merchants of Telensin; for the citie of Telensin is but fourteene miles from hence. Since the time that Oran was surprized by the Christians, the Vene∣tians would no longer frequent Oran, searing least the Spanyards hauing it in possession should worke them some mischiefe: wherfore then they began to repaire vnto this port. The townesmen in times past were most ciuill peo∣ple, the greatest part being weauers of cotton and of linnen. Their houses are most stately built, and haue euery one fountaines belonging vnto them: likewise here are many vines running pleasantly vpon bowers or arbours. Their houses are paued with mats of diuers colours, and their chambers and vaults are curiously painted and carued. Howbeit, so soone as the inhabi∣tants were aduertised of the losse of Oran, they fled from Hunain and left it void of inhabitants: sauing that the king of Telensin maintaineth here a garison of footemen, who giue notice when any merchants ships approch. Their fields abound with cherries, peaches, figs, oliues, and other fruites: howbeit they reape but little commoditie thereby. I my selfe passing this way could not but bewaile the extreme calamitie whereinto the inhabitants of this towne were fallen: at the same time there arriued a certaine ship of<NOTE PLACE="marg">A ship of great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> Genoa, which one ship brought commodities sufficient to serue Telensin for fiue yeeres: the tenth part whereof amounting to fifteene thousand duc∣kats, was paid for tribute to the king.</P>

<HEAD>Of the great citie of Telensin, other wise called Tremizen.</HEAD>
<P>TElensin is a great citie and the royall seate of the king; but who were the first founders thereof it is vncertaine: howbeit most certaine it is, that this citie was very small at the begin∣ning, and began greatly to be augmented at the same time when Haresgol was laid waste. For then, a certaine family cal∣led Abdulguad bearing rule, it increased so exceedingly, that in the raigne of king <HI>Abu Tesfin</HI> it contained sixteene thousand families. And then it was an honourable and well-gouerned citie: howbeit <HI>Ioseph</HI> king of Fez conti∣nually molested it, and with an huge armie besieged it for seuen yeeres to∣gether. This <HI>Ioseph</HI> hauing built a fort vpon the east side of the towne, put the besieged citizens to such distresse, that they could no longer endure the extreme famine: wherefore with one accord they all went vnto their king, beseeching him to haue compassion vpon their want. The king, to make them acquainted with his daintie fare, which he had to supper, shewed them a dish of sodden horse-flesh and barlie. And then they well perceiued how little the kings estate was better then the estate of the meanest citizen of them all. Soone after the king hauing procured an assemblie, perswaded his people that it was much more honourable to die in battel for the defence of their countrie, then to liue so miserable a life. Which words of the king so inflamed all their mindes to the battell, that the day following they resol∣ued to encounter the enemie, and valiantly to fight it out. But it fell out farre better for them then they expected; for the same night king <HI>Ioseph</HI> was slaine by one of his owne people: which newes being brought vnto the citizens, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> courage they marched all out of the towne, easily vanquishing and killing the confused multitude of their enemies; after which vnexpected victorie they found victuals sufficient in the enemies campe to relieue their long and tedious famine. About fortie yeeres after, the fourth king of Fez of the Marin-familie called <HI>Abulhesen,</HI> built a towne within two miles west∣ward of the citie of Telensin. Then he besieged Telensin for thirty moneths together, making daily and fierce assaults against it, and euery night ere∣cting some new fort, so that at length the Fessan forces next vnto Telensin easily entred the citie, and hauing conquered it, caried home the king there∣of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Telensin taken prisoner and beheaded.</NOTE> captiue vnto Fez, where he was by the king of Fez beheaded, and his car∣case was cast foorth among the filth of the citie: and this was the second and the greater dammage that Telensin sustained. After the decay of the Marin∣familie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> began in many places to be repaired, and replenished with new inhabitants, insomuch that it increased to twelue thousand families. Here each trade and occupation hath a peculiar place, after the manner of Fez, sauing that the buildings of Fez are somewhat more stately. Here are also many and beautifull temples, hauing their Mahumetan priestes and preachers. Likewise here are fiue colleges most sumptuously built, some by
<PB N="221" REF="147"/>
the king of Telensin, and some by the king of Fez. Here also are store of goodly bathes and hot-houses, albeit they haue not such plentie of water as is at Fez. Also here are very many innes built after the manner of Africa: vnto two of which innes the merchants of Genoa and Venice doe vsually resort. A great part of this citie is inhabited with Iewes, who were in times past all of them exceeding rich: vpon their heads they weare a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Turbant.</NOTE> Dulipan to distinguish them from other citizens: but in the yeere of the Hegeira 923, vpon the death of king <HI>Abuhabdilla,</HI> they were all so robbed and spoiled, that they are now brought almost vnto beggerie. Moreouer in this citie there are many conducts, the fountaines whereof are not farre from the citie-walles, so that they may easily be stopped by any forren enemie. The citie-wall is very high and impregnable, hauing fiue great gates vpon it, at euery one of which there is placed a garde of soldiers, and certaine receiuers of the kings custome. On the south side of the citie standeth the kings palace, enuironed with most high walles, and containing many other palaces within it, which are none of them destitute of their fountaines and pleasant gardens: this royall palace hath two gates, one leading into the fields, and the other into the citie, and at this gate standeth the captaine of the garde. The territorie of Telensin containeth most pleasant habitations, whither the citizens in sum∣mer-time vse to retire themselues: for besides the beautifull pastures and cleere fountaines, there is such abundance of all kinde of fruites to delight both the eies and the taste, that to my remembrance I neuer sawe a more pleasant place: their figs they vse to drie in the sunne and to keepe vntill win∣ter: and as for almonds, peaches, melons, and pome-citrons, they grow here in great plentie. Three miles eastward of this citie are diuers mils vpon the riuer of Sefsif; and some other there are also not far from the citie vpon the mountaine of Elcalha. The south part of the citie is inhabited by Iewes, law∣yers, and notaries: here are also very many students, and professours of di∣uers artes, which haue maintenance allowed them out of the fiue forenamed colleges. The citizens are of fower sorts, to wit, some artificers, some mer∣chants, others schollers and doctors, and all the residue soldiers. The mer∣chants are men most iust, trustie, liberall, and most zealous of the common good; who for the most part exercise traffique with the Negros. The artifi∣cers liue a secure, quiet, and merrie life. The kings soldiers being all of a comely personage and of great valour, receiue very large and liberall pay, for they are monethly allowed three peeces of the gold-coine of Telensin, which are worth three Italian duckats and one second part. All students be∣fore they attaine to the degree of a doctor liue a bare and miserable life, but hauing attained thereunto, they are made either professours or notaries, or priestes. The citizens and merchants of this citie are so neate and curious in their apparell, that sometimes they excell the citizens of Fez in brauerie. The artificers weare short garments carrying seldome a Dulipan vpon their heads, and contenting themselues with plaine caps: their shooes reach vp to their mid-leg. Of all others the soldiers go woorst apparelled, for wearing
<PB N="222" REF="148"/>
a shirt or iacket with wide sleeues, they cast ouer it a large mantle made of cotton, and thus they are clad both sommer and winter: sauing that in win∣ter they haue certaine iackets of leather with hoods vpon them, such as tra∣uellers vse in Italie, and by this meanes their heads are defended from raine and from snow. The schollers and students are diuersly apparelled, accor∣ding to their abilitie, and according to the fashion of their natiue countrie: the doctors, iudges, and priestes goe in more sumptuous and costly attire.</P>

<HEAD>The customes and rites obserued in the King of Telensin his court.</HEAD>
<P>A Woonder it is to see how stately and magnificently the King of Te∣lensin behaueth himselfe, for no man may see him nor be admitted to parle with him, but onely the principall nobles of his court, each one of whom are assigned to beare offices according to their place and dignitie. In this court are sundry offices and dignities, and the Kings lieutenant beeing principall officer, allotteth vnto each one such places of dignitie, as may be correspondent to their honour: and this lieutenant leuieth the kings armies, and sometime conducteth them against the enemie. The second officer is the Kings chiefe Secretarie, who writeth and recordeth all things pertaining to the King. The third is the high treasurer, who is bound by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> office to receiue tributes and customes. The fourth is the kings dispensator or almoner, who bestoweth such liberalitie as the king vouchsafeth. The fift is the captaine of the kings garde, who so often as any nobles are admitted to the kings presence, conducteth the garde vnto the palace-gate. Then are there other meaner officers, as namely, the master of the kings stable, the ouerseer of his saddles &amp; stirrops, and his chiefe chamberlaine, who giueth attendance onely at such times as any courtiers are admitted vnto the kings audience. For at other times the kings wiues, with certaine Christian cap∣tiues, and eunuches doe performe that dutie. The king sometimes in sump∣tuous and costly apparellrideth vpon a stately stead richly trapped and fur∣nished. In riding he obserueth not much pompe nor many ceremonies; neither indeede doth he carrie so great a traine; for you shall scarcely see a thousand horsemen in his companie, except perhaps in time of warre, when as the Arabians and other people giue attendance. When the king goeth foorth with an armie, there are not many carriages transported there∣in, neither can you then discerne the king by his apparell from any meane captaine: and though he conducteth neuer so great a garde of soldiers, yet a man would not thinke how sparing he is of his coine. Gold-money he coi∣neth of baser golde, then that whereof the Italian money called <HI>Bislacchi</HI> is coined, but it is of a greater size, for one peece thereof waigheth an Italian<NOTE PLACE="marg">A passage from Europe to Ac∣thiopia through the kingdome of Tremizen.</NOTE> duckat and one fourth part. He stampeth likewise coine of siluer &amp; of brasse. His dominions are but slenderly inhabited: howbeit because the way from Europe to Aethiopia lieth through his kingdome, he reapeth much benefit
<PB N="223" REF="148"/>
by the wares that passe by, especially since the time that Oran was surprized by the Christians. At the same time Telensin it selfe was made tributarie, which was euer before a free citie: whereupon the king that was the author thereof, was extremely hated of his subiects till his dying day. Afterward his sonne that succeeded him, demanded customes and tributes likewise: for which cause being expelled out of his kingdome by the people, he was en∣forced to craue aide of the emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, by whose meanes (as is beforesaid) he was restored vnto his said kingdome. When Oran was subiect vnto the king of Telensin, the region therabout paid vnto the king for yeerly tribute sometime three thousand, and sometime fower thousand duckats, the greatest part whereof was allowed vnto the kings garde, and to the Ara∣bian soldiers. I my selfe continuing certaine monethes in this kings court, had good experience of his liberalitie. I haue indeede omitted many parti∣culars in the description of this court of Telensin: but because they agreed for the most part with those things which we reported of Fez, I haue here passed them ouer, least I should seeme too tedious vnto the reader.</P>

They are molested with daily inconueniences, and pay yeerely tribute vnto the king of Telensin. Vpon the foresaid mountaines are sundrie villages, among which there are two principall, whereof the one called Cha∣lath Haoara, and built in manner of a castle vpon the side of a certaine hill, containeth to the number of fortie merchants and artificers houses: the other called Elmo Hascar is the seate of the kings lieutenant ouer those re∣gions; and in this village euery thursday there is a great market, where abun∣dance of cattell, corne, raisins, figs, and honie is to be sold: here are likewise cloth-merchants and diuers other chapmen, which for breuities sake I passe ouer in silence.

This towne was greatly frequented with merchants of Catalonia, and of Genoa: and one street thereof is at this present called the street of the Genoueses. They were at perpetuall enmitie with the king of Telensin, neither would they euer accept of any gouernor, but one which receiued the kings tribute. But the townesmen chose one of their chiefe Burgo-masters to iudge of cases ciuill and criminall.

But so often as any tribute was demanded, euery man to eschew the payment thereof, would not sticke to professe himselfe a Christian: where∣fore it was then determined, that such as were Christians indeed should be distinguished from others by the foresaid crosses. At length the Gothes being expelled, they all reuolted vnto the Mahumetan religion; howbeit this custome of painting crosses remained still amongthem, neither doe they know the reason thereof.

<P>GEzeir in the Moores language signifieth an island, which name is thought to haue beene giuen vnto this citie, because it lieth neere vn∣to the isles of Maiorica, Minorica, and Ieuiza: howbeit the Spanyards call it Alger. It was founded by the Africans of the familie of Mesgana, where∣fore in old time it was called by the name of Mesgana. It is a large towne, containing families to the number of fower thousand, and is enuironed with most stately and impregnable walles. The buildings thereof are very artificiall and sumptuous: and euery trade and occupation hath here a se∣uerall place. Innes, bath-stoues, and temples here are very beautifull; but the stateliest temple of all standeth vpon the sea-shore. Next vnto the sea there is a most pleasant walke vpon that part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wall, which the waues of the sea beat vpon. In the suburbes are many gardēs replenished with all kind of fruits. On the east side of the towne runneth a certaine riuer hauing many mils thereupon: and out of this riuer they draw water fit for drinke, and for the seruices of the kitchin. It hath most beautifull plaines adioining vpon it, and especially one called Metteggia, which extendeth fortie fiue miles in length, and almost thirtie miles in bredth, and aboundeth mightily with all kindes of graine. This towne for many yeeres was subiect vnto the king∣dome of Telensin: but hearing that Bugia was also gouerned by a king, and being neerer thereunto, they submitted themselues vnto the king of Bugia.
<PB N="230" REF="152"/>
For they saw that the king of Telensin could not sufficiently defend them against their enemies, and also that the king of Bugia might doe them great dammage, wherefore they offered vnto him a yeerely tribute of their owne accord, and yet remained almost free from all exaction. But certaine yeeres after, the inhabitants of this citie building for themselues gallies, began to play the pirates, and greatly to molest the foresaid islands. Whereupon king <HI>Ferdinando</HI> prouided a mightie armada, hoping thereby to become lorde of the citie. Likewise vpon a certaine high rocke standing opposit against the towne, he caused a strong forte to be built, and that within gun-shot of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alger become tributarie to the king of Spaine.</NOTE> citie, albeit the citie walles could not be endammaged thereby. Wherefore the citizens immediately sent ambassadours into Spaine, to craue a league for ten yeeres, vpon condition that they should pay certaine yeerely tribute; which request was granted by king <HI>Ferdinando.</HI> And so they remained for certaine moneths free from the danger of warre: but at length <HI>Barbarossa</HI> hastening to the siege of Bugia, and hauing woon one fort built by the Spa∣niards, determined to encounter another, hoping if he could obtaine that also, that he should soone conquer the whole kingdome of Bugia. Howbeit all matters fell not out according to his expectation: for a great part of his soldiers being husbandmen, when they perceiued the time of sowing corne to approch, without any leaue or licence they forsooke their generall, and returned home to the plough-taile. And many Turks also did the like, so that <HI>Barbarossa</HI> failing of his purpose, was constrained to breake vp the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Howbeit before his departure, he set on fire with his owne handes twelue gallies, which lay in a riuer but three miles from Bugia. And then with fortie of his soldiers he retired himselfe to the castle of Gegel being from Bugia about sixtie miles distant, where he remained for certaine daies. In the mean while, king <HI>Ferdinando</HI> deceasing, the people of Alger released themselues from paying any more tribute: for seeing <HI>Barbarossa</HI> to be a most valiant warriour, and a deadly enemie vnto Christians, they sent for him, and chose him captaine ouer all their forces; who presently encountred the fort, but to little effect. Afterward this <HI>Barbarossa</HI> secretly murthered the gouernour of the citie in a certaine bath. The said gouernour was prince of the Arabi∣ans dwelling on the plaines of Mettegia, his name was <HI>Selim Etteumi,</HI> de∣scended of the familie of <HI>Telaliba,</HI> and created gouernour of Alger at the same time when Bugia was taken by the Spanyards: this man was slaine by <HI>Barbarossa,</HI> after he had gouerned many yeeres.

At all the fore∣said accidents I my selfe was present, as I trauelled from Fez to Tunis, and was entertained by one that was sent ambassadour from the people of Alger into Spaine, from whence he brought three thousand bookes written in the Arabian toong.

<HEAD>A description of the kingdomes of Bugia and Tunis.</HEAD>
<P>WHen as in the former part of this my historie I diuided Barbaria into certaine parts, I determined to write of Bugia as of a kingdome by it selfe: and I found indeed that not many yeeres ago it was a kingdome. For Bu∣gia was subiect to the king of Tunis, and albeit for certaine yeeres the king of Telensin was Lord there∣of, yet was it at length recouered againe by the king of Tunis, who committed the gouernment of the city vnto one of his sons, both for the tranquillitie of Bugia, and also that no discord might happen among his sonnes after his decease. He left behinde him three sonnes, the eldest whereof was called <HI>Habdulhaziz,</HI> and vnto him he bequeathed the kingdome of Bugia, as is aforesaide: vnto the second, whose name was <HI>Hut∣men,</HI> he left the kingdome of Tunis: and the third called <HI>Hammare,</HI> he made gouernour of the region of dates. This <HI>Hammare</HI> began foorthwith to wage warre against his brother <HI>Hutmen,</HI> by whom being at length taken in the towne of Asfacos, &amp; depriued of both his eies, he was carried captiue vnto Tunis, where he liued many yeeres blinde: but his brother <HI>Hutmen</HI> gouer∣ned the kingdome of Tunis full fortie yeeres. The prince of Bugia being most louing and dutifull to his brother, raigned for many yeeres with great tianquilitie, till at length he was by king <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of Spaine, and by the meanes of one <HI>Pedro de Nauarra,</HI> cast out of his kingdome.</P>

<HEAD>A description of the great citie of Bugia.</HEAD>
<P>THis auncient citie of Bugia built (as some thinke) by the Ro∣mans, vpon the side of an high mountaine, neere vnto the Me∣diterran sea, is enuironed with walles of great height, and most stately in regard of their antiquitie. The part thereof now peo∣pled containeth aboue eight thousand families: but if it were all replenished with buildings, it were capeable of more then fower and twentie thousand housholds, for it is of a great length. The houses, temples, and colleges of this citie are most sumptuously built. Professors of liberall sciences heere
<PB N="236" REF="155"/>
are great store, whereof some teach matters pertaining to the lawe, and others professe naturall Philosophie. Neither Monasteries, Innes, nor Ho∣spitals erected after their manner are heere wanting: and their market place is very large and faire: their streetes either descend or ascend, which is verie troublesome to them that haue any busines in the towne. In that part of the citie next vnto the toppe of the mountaine standeth a strong castle, most sumptuously and beautifully walled: and there are such notable letters and pictures most artificially carued vpon the plaister-worke and timber, that they are thought to haue cost much more then the building of the wall it selfe. The citizens were exceeding rich, and vsed with their warlike gallies continually to molest the coasts of Spaine; which was the occasion of the vtter ouerthrowe of their citie. For <HI>Pedro de Nauarra</HI> was sent against them with a fleete of fowerteene sailes onely. The citizens being addicted whol∣lie<NOTE PLACE="marg">The citie of Bu∣gia taken by Pedro de Na∣uarra.</NOTE> to pleasure and ease, and being terrified with the rumour of warre, bicause they were neuer exercised therein, were no sooner aduertised of <HI>Pedro de Nauarra</HI> his approch, but al of them togither with their king betooke them∣selues to flight, and left their citie abounding with all kinde of riches and wealth, to bee spoiled by the Spaniards, so that it was easily taken, in the yeere of <HI>Mahomet</HI> his Hegeira nine hundred and seuenteene. Soone after <HI>Pedro de Nauarra</HI> hauing sacked the citie, built a strong forte vpon the sea shore, and repaired an other which had lien a long time waste, furnishing them both with soldiers and munition. And sixe yeeres after, <HI>Barbarossa</HI> the Turke being desirous to winne this citie from the Christians, and hauing leuied onely a thousand soldiers, tooke the old forte, bicause he was fauou∣red by the inhabitants of all the mountaines adiacent: wherein hauing pla∣ced a garrison, he attempted to winne the other fort also: but at his first en∣counter he lost an hundred of his principall Turkes, &amp; fower hundred of the mountainers that came to aide him; insomuch that <HI>Barbarossa</HI> was enforced to flie vnto the castle of Gegel, as is aforesaid.</P>

<P>THis ancient castle built by the Africans, vpon an high rocke by the Mediterran sea, is distant about threescore miles from Bugia. Fami∣lies it containeth to the number of fiue hundred; and the buildings thereof are very base. The inhabitants are of a trustie and ingenuous dispo∣sition, and do most of them exercise husbandrie: howbeit their fieldes are but barren, and apt onely for barly, flaxe, and hempe. They haue great store of figs and nuts, which they vse to carrie in certaine barkes vnto Tunis. They haue in despight of the kings of Bugia and Tunis continued alwaies free from tribute: for that impregnable mountaine can be surprised by no siege nor encounter of the enimie. At length they yeelded themselues vn∣to <HI>Barbarossa,</HI> who demaunded none other tribute of them, but onely the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of certaine fruits and corne.</P>

By this towne runneth a certaine riuer, on both sides whereof grow the best wal-nuts and figs that are to be found in the whole kingdome of Tunis, being vsually carried to Constantina to be solde, which citie is thence distant an hundred and eightie miles. The fields of this towne are ex∣ceeding fruitfull, and the inhabitants are very rich, liberall, and curious in their apparell. Here is an hospitall maintained at the common charges of the towne, to entertaine strangers that passe by. Here is a college also, the students whereof are allowed their diet and apparell. Neither is this towne destitute of a most stately and well-furnished temple. Their women are white, hauing blacke haires and a most delicate skinne, because they fre∣quent the bath-stoues so often. Most of their houses are but of one storie high, yet are they very decent, and haue each one a garden thereto belong∣ing, replenished with damaske-roses, myrtles, cammomill, and other herbes and flowers, and being watred with most pleasant fountaines. In these gar∣dens likewise there are most stately arbours and bowres, the coole shadow whereof in summer-time is most acceptable.

<HEAD>Of the towne of Chollo.</HEAD>
<P>THe great towne of Chollo founded by the Romans, vpon the Medi∣terran sea, at the foot of a certaine high mountaine, is enuironed with no walles at all: for the walles were razed to the ground by the Goths: neither did the Mahumetans, when they had got possession, build them vp againe. Howbeit this towne is notably well gouerned, and well stored with inhabitants, which are all men of a liberall and tractable disposition. They haue continually great traffique with the merchants of Genoa, and doe ga∣ther abundance of waxe and hides. Their fieldes vpon the mountaine are exceeding fruitfull, and they haue alwaies so defended themselues against the princes of Tunis and Constantina, that vntill this present they remaine free from tribute. From the iniurie of Constantina they are easily defended, both in regarde of the difficult mountaines lying in the mid-way, and also in respect of the great distance; for Constantina standeth almost an hundred and twentie miles off. Neither is there any citie throughout the whole king∣dome of Tunis, either for wealth, or strong situation, any way comparable vnto this.</P>

<HEAD>Of the towne of Sucaicada.</HEAD>
<P>THis ancient citie built by the Romans also vpon the Mediterran sea, and standing about thirtie fiue miles from Constantina, was wasted and almost vtterly destroied by the Goths: howbeit by reason of the hauen, being so famous and so frequented by the merchants of Genoa, the prince of Constantina caused certaine faire houses to be built thereabouts, for the said merchants of Genoa, to repose themselues and their goodes therein: and vpon a mountaine not farre off he built a strong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for the securitie and defence of the said merchants from all enemies whatsoeuer. From the said hauen to Constantina the high way is paued with certaine black stones, such as are to be seene in some places of Italie, being there cal∣led <HI>Le strade Romane,</HI> which is a manifest argument, that Sucaicada was built by the Romans.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the citie of Constantina.</HEAD>
<P>NO man can denie the Romans to haue beene founders of this citie, that shall consider the great strength, height, and antiquitie of the walles, and how curiously they are beset and adorned with blacke stones. This citie standeth vpon the south side of an exceeding high moun∣taine, and is enuironed with steepe rocks, vnder which rocks and within the compasse whereof runneth the riuer called Sufegmare, so that the said deepe riuer with the rocks on either side, serueth in stead of a towne-ditch to Con∣stantina. The north part is compassed with a wall of great thicknes: and there are two extreme narrow passages onely, to enter into the citie, one on the
<PB N="239" REF="156"/>
east part, and another on the west. The citie-gates are very large and stately. The citie it selfe containeth aboue eight thousand families. Buildings it hath very sumptuous, as namely, the chiefe temple, two colleges, three or fower monasteries, and other such like. Here euery trade and occupation hath a seuerall place assigned: and the inhabitants are right honest and valiant people. Here is likewise a great companie of merchants, whereof some sell cloth and wooll, others send oile and silke into Numidia, and the residue exchange linnen-cloth and other wares for slaues and dates. Neither are dates so cheape in any region of all Barbarie besides. The kings of Tunis vsually commit the gouernment of Constantina vnto their eldest sonnes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hard suc∣cesse of the king of Tunis his three sonnes.</NOTE> and so he that is now king of Tunis bestowed Constantina vpon his eldest sonne in like sort: who waging warre against the Arabians was slaine in the first battel. Then fel the gouernment of Constantina vnto his second sonne, whose intemperate life was the cause of his sudden and vntimely death. Af∣ter him succeeded the third and yoongest sonne, who in regarde of his inso∣lent and shamelesse behauiour, was so hated of all the citizens, that some had determined to kill him: whereof his father hauing intelligence, sent for him, and kept him for certaine yeeres prisoner at Tunis. Afterward he com∣mitted the gouernment of Constantina to a certaine Renegado that of a Christian became a Mahumetan: this Renegado he trusted as his owne bro∣ther, for he had made former triall of him: who for many yeeres gouerned the place with great tranquillitie. Vpon the north part of the citie standeth a certaine strong castle built at the same time when the citie it selfe was built: which castle was more strongly fortified then before, by one <HI>Elcaied Nabil</HI> the kings lieutenant: and this castle greatly bridled both the citizens, and all the bordering Arabians, whose great captaine it held as prisoner, and relea∣sed him not, till he had left his three sonnes for hostages. At length the said <HI>Elcaied</HI> grew so hautie, that he coined money, to the great contempt of his king and soueraigne, whom notwithstanding he endeuoured by many giftes and presents to appease. But when men perceiued <HI>Elcaied</HI> to degenerate from his first forme of gouernment, they that before loued him, and had him in high regarde, were presently of another minde, and vtterly forsooke him. So that laying siege vnto a certaine citie of Numidia called Pescara, he perceiued some treason to be attempted against him: and thereupon retur∣ning foorthwith to Constantina, he found the citie-gates shut against him: from whence he presently tooke his iourney to the king of Tunis, and was by him cast into prison, and not restored to libertie, till he had paid an hun∣dred thousand duckats. Afterward by the kings aide he was restored to his former gouernment: but when he began to tyrannize ouer some of the chiefe citizens, he againe prouoked the whole citie vnto armes, who besie∣ged foorthwith the castle whereunto he fled, which was such a corrasiue vn∣to <HI>Elcaied</HI> his minde, that within few daies he died for sorrow. And so the people after they were reconciled to their king, would fromthencefoorth neuer admit any forren gouernour: wherefore the king of Tunis was (as is
<PB N="240" REF="157"/>
aforesaid) againe constrained to send his owne sonnes thither. The fields be∣longing to this citie are exceeding fertil. And on either side the riuer which runneth through the plaines, there are most commodious gardens, if they were well husbanded. Also without the citie stand many faire and ancient buildings. About a mile and a halfe from the citie standeth a certaine trium∣phall arch, like vnto the triumphall arches at Rome, which the grosse com∣mon people thinke to haue beene a castle where innumerable diuels remai∣ned, which (they say) were expelled by the Mahumetans, when they came first to inhabite Constantina. From the citie to the riuer they descend by certaine staires hewen out of the rocke: and neere vnto the riuer standeth a little house so artificially cut out of the maine rocke, that the roofe, pillers, and walles are all of one continued substance, and here the women of Con∣stantina wash their linnen. Neere vnto the citie likewise there is a certaine<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hot baths.</NOTE> bath of hot water dispersing it selfe among the rocks: in this bath are great store of snailes, which the fond women of the citie call Diuels: and when any one falleth into a feuer or any other disease, they suppose the snailes to be the authors thereof. And the onely remedie that they can apply vpon<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fond and senseles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> such an occasion is this: first they kill a white hen, putting her into a platter with her feathers on, and then verie solemnly with waxe-candles they carry her to the bathe, and there leaue her: and many good fellowes there are, which so soone as the silly women haue set downe their hens at the bath, wil come secretly thither, and conuey away the hens to their owne kitchins. Somewhat farther from the citie eastward there is a fountaine of extreme cold water, and neere vnto it standeth a certaine building of marble adorned with sundrie Hieroglyphicall pictures or emblemes, such as I haue seene at Rome, and at many other places of Europe. But the common people ima∣gine that it was in times past a Grāmar-schoole, &amp; because both the masters and schollers thereof were most vitious, they were transformed (say they) into marble. The inhabitants twise euerie yeere send great store of wares into Numidia: and because as they trauell, they are in danger of the Arabian theeues, they hire certaine Turkish Harquebusiers for great wages to guard them. The merchants of Constantina trauelling to Tunis pay no tribute at all, but onely at their departure foorth of Constantina for the worth of eue∣rie 100. ducates in merchandise, they allow two ducates and a halfe.</P>

<HEAD>Of the ancient towne of Bona.</HEAD>
<P>THis towne built by the Romans vpon the Mediterran sea, almost 120. miles more to the west was in auncient times called Hippo, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">S.

It was in pro∣cesse of time subdued by the Gothes, and was afterward surprised and burnt to ashes by <HI>Hutmen</HI> the third patriarke after <HI>Mahumet.</HI> And many yeeres after they built a new town within two miles of the stones that were brought from the ruines of Bona: which new towne they called Beld Elhuneb, that is, the citie of the fruit called Ziziphus or Iuiuba, by reason of the great a∣bundance of that fruit: the which they vse to drie in the sunne, and to keepe till winter. It containeth almost three hundred families, and all the houses and buildings thereof are verie base, saue one onely temple which standeth next the sea. The inhabitants are all of an ingenuous disposition, some of them being merchants, and the residue artizans. Here is great store of lin∣nen-cloath wouen, the greatest part whereof is carried to Numidia. The inhabitants of this towne hauing vpon a time slaine their gouernours, were so bold as to threaten the king of Tunis: and they had without all doubt be∣trayed the towne vnto the Christians, had not the king of Tunis taken spe∣ciall heed thereunto. In this towne are certaine lewd people and most beg∣gerly apparelled, which notwithstanding are highly reuerenced by the citi∣zens. Here are no fountaines, nor yet any water at all, but rainewater onely which is kept in cesterns. On the east side of the towne standeth a strong ca∣stle built by the king of Tunis, where the gouernour of the towne appoin∣ted by the king hath his aboad. Vnto this towne adioyneth a most large plaine, containing in length fortie, and in bredth fiue and twentie miles: verie commodious it is for corne, and is inhabited by certaine Arabians cal∣led Merdez: these Arabians haue great store of cattell and but little money; and they bring good store of butter dayly vnto Bona. Vnto this towne the people of Tunis, of the isle of Gerbi, and of Genoa vse yeerely to resort, and to buy great abundance of corne and butter. Euerie friday they haue neere vnto the towne wals a market, which is well frequented euen till night. Not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great store of corall.</NOTE> farre from hence there is a certaine place in the sea, abounding with great store of corall: and because the townesmen know not how to fish for the same, the king of Tunis licenced certaine merchants of Genoa to fish for it: who in regard of the continuall assaults of pirates, because they could not speed of their purpose, they obtained leaue also of the king to build a castle neere vnto the place: but that the townesmen would in no case permit, saying

<HEAD>Of the citie of Tebessa.</HEAD>
<P>THis great and strong citie built by the Romans neere vnto Numidia, and being distant two hundred miles southward from the Mediterran sea, is compassed with an high wall made of such stones, as are to be seene vpon the Colosso at Rome: neither saw I, to my remembrance, any such wals in all Africa or Europe; and yet the houses and other buildings are verie base. Through part of this citie runneth a great riuer: and in the market, and diuers other places stand certaine marble pillers, hauing Epi∣grams and sentences with Latin letters engrauen vpon them: there are also other square pillers of marble couered with roofs. The plaines adiacent al∣beit verie drie, yet are they most fruitfull for corne. Fiue miles from hence grow such abundance of wall-nut-trees, as you would take them to be some thicke forrest. Neere vnto this towne standeth a certaine hill full of mighty caues, wherein the common people say, that giants inhabited of olde: but it is most euident, that those caues were digged by the Romans at the same time, when they built the citie: for certaine it is that the stones whereof the citie-walles consist, were taken out of those rockes. The inhabitants are people of a couetous, inhumane, and beastly disposition; neither will they vouchsafe to looke vpon a stranger: insomuch that <HI>Eldabag</HI> a famous Poet of the citie of Malaga in Granada, hauing in his trauell this way receiued some discourtesie, wrote in disgrace of Tebessa certaine satyricall verses, which my selfe likewise haue thought good here to set downe in the dispraise thereof.</P>

But to returne to our former purpose, these Tebessians haue alwaies rebelled against the king of Tunis, and haue slaine all the gouernours that he hath sent. Wherefore the king that now is, trauelling vpon a time towards Numidia, sent certaine ambassadours into the city, to know how the citizens stood affected towards him: vnto whom they (instead of <HI>God saue the King</HI>) made answere: <HI>God saue our Citie-walles.</HI> Whereat the king waxing wroth, sacked the citie forth∣with, beheaded and hanged diuers of the inhabitants, and made such hauock, that euer since it hath remained desolate.

<HEAD>Of the towne called Vrbs.</HEAD>
<P>BY the name of this towne it sufficiently appeareth, that the Romans were the first founders thereof. Situate it is vpon the most beautifull plaine of al Africa, which by reason of the abundance of fountaines is so wel stored with corne, that from thence to Tunis (which standeth 190. miles northward of this place) and to other regions adioyning, great plentie of corne is transported. In this towne are to bee seene sundrie monuments of the Romans, as namely images of marble, and euerie where vpon the walles are sentences in Latin letters engrauen: the towne-walles are most artifici∣ally and sumptuously built. This towne the Gothes, being assisted by the Moores, surprised, when as it contained the chiefe treasure and wealth that the Romanes enioyed in all Africa. Afterward it remained for certaine yeeres desolate, being at length notwithstanding inhabited a new, yet so, that it deserueth rather the name of a village then of a towne. Not far from this towne runneth a certaine riuer, vpon the which are diuers water-milles; and this riuer taketh his beginning from a little hill but halfe a mile distant from the towne. All the inhabitants are either weauers or husbandmen, and are continually molested by the king of Tunis. Howbeit if the fertilitie of the soyle, the pleasantnes of the place, and the holesome disposition of the aire, were as well knowne to the king, as they are to my selfe, I thinke verily that he would leaue Tunis, and goe and dwell in this region.

But because the name of this towne is no Arabian name, it seemeth, that the first name hath been oftentimes corrupted and changed.

It is inhabited with great store of wea∣uers and husbandmen, and the fields thereof are so large and fruitfull for all kindes of graine, that the people of the same region could not sufficiently manure them, vnlesse they were assisted by certaine bordering Arabians: and yet a great part of their fields lieth vntilled: howbeit they send continu∣ally great store of corne vnto Tunis.

<HEAD>Of the great citie of Carthage.</HEAD>
<P>THis famous and ancient citie was built at the first by a certaine people that came out of Syria. But others say that it was founded by a queene. The African chronicler <HI>Ibnu Rachich</HI> is of opinion, that it was built by a certaine people that came from Barca, being expelled thence by the king of Egypt: wherefore I cannot in this place affirme any certaintie as touching the founders thereof: for besides that the African historiogra∣phers disagree about this matter, there is none that hath left any writing thereof ancienter then the decay of the Roman empire: when as all the Ro∣mans that were found in Africa were expelled by the Goths. But afterward Tripolis of Barbaria and Capis being taken by the Mahumetans, the inha∣bitants of them both went vnto Carthage, whither the principall Romans and Goths had retired themselues, who endeuoured by all meanes to with∣stand the Mahumetans: and after many skirmishes the Romans fled to Bona, and the Goths left Carthage for a pray vnto the Mahumetans; so that it remained desolate many yeeres after, till a certaine Mahumetan patriarke called <HI>Elmahdi</HI> brought in new colonies: howbeit he could scarce furnish the twentith part with inhabitants. There are to be seene at this day certaine ruines of the citie-walles, till you come to a deepe and large cesterne. And there remaineth as yet also a certaine conduct which conueieth water to the citie from a mountaine thirtie miles distant, being like vnto the conduct of the great palace at Rome. Neere vnto Carthage likewise are certaine great and ancient buildings, the description whereof is out of my remembrance. On the west and south part of this citie are diuers gardens replenished with all kinde of fruites, which are carried from thence to Tunis in great abun∣dance. The plaines adioining to this citie are exceeding fruitfull, though not very large: for vpon the north part thereof lieth a mountaine, the sea, and the gulfe of Tunis: on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and south parts it ioyneth to the plaines of Bensart.

<HEAD>A description of the mightie citie of Tunis.</HEAD>
<P>THis citie is called by the Latines <HI>Tunetum,</HI> and by the Arabi∣ans Tunus, which name they thinke to be corrupt, because it signifieth nought in their language: but in olde time it was called Tarsis, after the name of a citie in Asia. At the first it was a small towne built by the Africans vpon a certaine lake, about twelue miles distant from the Mediterran sea. And vpon the decay of Carthage Tunis began to increase both in buildings and inhabitants. For the inhabitants of Carthage were loth to remaine any longer in their owne towne, fearing least some armie would haue beene sent out of Europe: wherefore they repaired vnto Tunis, and greatly enlarged the buildings thereof. Afterward came thither one <HI>Hucba Vtmen</HI> the fourth Mahumetan patriarke, who perswaded the citizens, that no armie or garrison ought to<NOTE PLACE="marg">The building of Cairaoan.</NOTE> remaine in any sea-townes; wherefore he built another citie called Cairao∣an, being distant from the Mediterran sea thirtie, and from Tunis almost an hundred miles: vnto which citie the armie marched from Tunis, and in the roome thereof other people were sent to inhabite. About an hundred and fiftie yeeres after, Cairaoan being sacked by the Arabians, the prince therof was expelled, and became gouernour of the kingdome of Bugia: howbeit he left certaine kinsmen of his at Tunis, who gouerned that citie. And ten yeeres after, Bugia was taken by <HI>Ioseph</HI> the sonne of <HI>Tesfin,</HI> who seeing the humanitie of the foresaid prince, would not expel him out of his kingdome: but so long as it remained to the said prince and his posteritie, <HI>Ioseph</HI> caused it to be free from all molestation. Afterward <HI>Abdul Mumen</HI> king of Maroco hauing recouered Mahdia from the Christians, marched toward Tunis, and got possession thereof also. And so Tunis remained peaceably vnder the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tunis subiect vnto Abdul∣Mumen and other kings of Maroco.</NOTE> dominion of the kings of Maroco, so long as the kingdome was gouerned by the said <HI>Abdul,</HI> and his sonne <HI>Ioseph,</HI> and their successors <HI>Iacob</HI> and <HI>Man∣sor.</HI> But after the decease of <HI>Mansor,</HI> his sonne <HI>Mahumet Ennasir</HI> made war against the king of Spaine, by whom being vanquished, he fled to Maroco, and there within few yeeres ended his life. After him succeeded his brother <HI>Ioseph,</HI> who was slaine by certaine soldiers of the king of Telensin. And so vpon the death of <HI>Mahumet,</HI> and of his brother <HI>Ioseph,</HI> the Arabians began to inhabite the territorie of Tunis, and to make often sieges and assaults against the citie it selfe: whereupon the gouernour of Tunis aduertised the king of Maroco, that vnlesse present aide were sent, he must be coustrained
<PB N="247" REF="160"/>
to yeeld Tunis vnto the Arabians. The king therefore sent a certaine valiant captaine, called <HI>Habduluahidi,</HI> and borne in Siuill a citie of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or perhaps Andaluzia.</NOTE> Granada, with a fleete of twentie sailes vnto Tunis, which he found halfe destroied by the Arabians: but so great was his eloquence and wisedome, that he restored all things to their former estate, and receiued the yeerely tribute. After <HI>Hab∣duluahidi</HI> succeeded his sonne <HI>Abu <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> who in learning and dexteritie of wit, excelled his father. This <HI>Abu</HI> built a castle vpon a certaine high place of the west part of Tunis, which he adorned with faire buildings and with a most beautifull temple. Afterward taking his iourney vnto the kingdome of Tripolis, and returning home by the southerne regions, he gathered tribute in all those places: so that after his decease he left great treasure vnto his sonne. And after <HI>Abu</HI> succeeded his sonne, who grew so insolent, that he would not be subiect to the king of Maroco, because he perceiued his king∣dome to decay: at the same time also had the Marin-familie gotten posses∣sion of the kingdome of Fez, and so was the familie of <HI>Beni Zeijen</HI> possessed of the kingdomes of Telensin and Granada. And so while all those regions were at mutuall dissension, the dominions of Tunis began mightily to en∣crease. Insomuch that the king of Tunis marched vnto Telensin, and de∣manded tribute of the inhabitants. Wherefore the king of Fez, who as then laid siege against Maroco, craued by his ambassadours the king of Tunis his friendship, and with great giftes obtained the same. Then the king of Tunis returning home conquerour from Telensin, was receiued with great tri∣umph, and was saluted king of all Africa, because indeed there was no prince of Africa at the same time comparable vnto him. Wherefore he began to ordaine a roiall court, and to choose Secretaries, counsellers, captaines, and other officers appertaining to a king; after the very same manner that was vsed in the court of Maroco. And from the time of this king euen till our times, the kingdome of Tunis hath so prospered, that now it is accounted the richest kingdome in all Africa. The said kings sonne raigning after his fa∣thers death, enlarged the suburbes of Tunis with most stately buildings. Without the gate called Bed Suvaica he built a streete containing to the number of three hundred families: and he built another streete at the gate called Bed el Manera consisting of more then a thousand families. In both of these streetes dwell great store of artificers, &amp; in the street last mentioned all the Christians of Tunis, which are of the kings garde, haue their aboad. Likewise there is a third streete built at the gate next vnto the sea, called Beb el Bahar, and being but halfe a mile distant from the gulfe of Tunis. Hither doe the Genoueses, Venetians, and all other Christian merchants resort, and here they repose themselues out of the tumult and concourse of the Moores: and this street is of so great bignes, that it containeth three hun∣dred families of Christians and Moores, but the houses are verie low, and of small receit. The families of the citie, togither with them of the suburbs, amount almost to the number of ten thousand. 'This stately and populous citie hath a peculiar place assigned for each trade and occupation. Heere
<PB N="248" REF="161"/>
dwell great store of linnen-weauers, and the linnen that they weaue is excee∣ding fine, &amp; sold at a great price ouer al Africa. The women of this towne vse<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange kind of spinning.</NOTE> a strange kinde of spinning: for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vpon an high place or on the vp∣per part of the house, they let downe their spindles at a window, or through a hole of the plancher into a lower roume, so that the weight of the spindle makes the thread verie equall and euen. And here the linnen-drapers haue many shops, and are accounted the wealthiest citizens in all Tunis: here are also great store of grocers, apothecaries, taylors, and of all other trades and occupations: butchers here are verie many which sell mutton for the most part, especially in the spring, and in summer: also here are abundance of all kinde of artificers, euerie of which to describe would prooue tedious: the apparell of their merchants, priests, and doctors is verie decent. Vpon their heads they weare a Dulipan, which is couered with a great linnen-cloth: the courtiers likewise and the souldiers weare all of them Dulipans, but not co∣uered with linnen. Rich men here are but few, by reason of the exceeding scarcitie of all kinde of graine: for a man cannot till a piece of ground, be it neuer so neere the citie, in regard of the manifold inuasions of the Ara∣bians. Corne is brought vnto them from other regions and cities, as name∣ly from Vrbs, from Beggia, and from Bona. Some of the citizens of Tunis haue certaine fields in the suburbs walled round about, where they sowe some quantitie of barley and of other corne: howbeit the soyle is maruel∣uellous dry, and standeth in need of much watring: for which purpose euery man hath a pit, whereout with a certaine wheele turned about by a mule or a camel, and through certaine conueyances and passages made for the nonce, they water all the vpper part of their ground: now consider (I pray you) what great crop of corne can be reaped out of so little a field, walled round about and watred by such cunning and industrie. Bread they make verie excellent, albeit they leaue the bran still among the flower, &amp; they bake their loaues in certaine mortars, such as the Egyptians vse to beat flaxe in. The merchants and most part of the citizens vse for food a kinde of homely pulse or pappe called by them Besis, being made of barley meale in forme of a dumpling, whereupon they powre oyle or the broth of Pome-citrons. And there is a certaine place in the citie where nothing but barley prepared in a readines to make the said pulse, is to be sold. They vse also another kinde of foode almost as homely as the former: for seething a quantitie of meale through∣ly in water, and afterward braying it in another vessell with a pestill, they powre oyle or flesh-pottage thereunto, and so eat it: and this meate they call Bezin: but the richer sort feede themselues with more daintie meats. All their milles (except such as stand vpon a riuer not far from the citie) are turned about either by the strength of mules, or asses. In this citie they haue no fountaines, riuers, nor welles of fresh water: but they all vse raine-water taken out of cesterns, sauing that there is a fountaine in the suburbs, from whence certaine porters bring salt-water into the citie to sell, which they thinke to be more holesome and fit for drinke then raine-water. Other wels
<PB N="249" REF="161"/>
there are that affoorde most excellent water, which is reserued onely for the king &amp; his courtiers. In this citie there is one most stately temple, furnished with sufficient number of priests, and with rich reuenues. Other temples there be also, but not endowed with so ample reuenues: here are colledges likewise and monasteries built after their maner, al which are maintained vp∣on the common beneuolence of the citie. There are certaine people in this citie whom a man would take to be distraught, which goe bare-headed and bare-footed, carrying stones about with them, and these are reuerenced by the common people, for men of singular holines. Moreouer on the behalfe of one of these mad fellowes, called <HI>Sidi el Dahi;</HI> and for the residue of his fond societie, the king of Tunis built one of the foresaid monasteries, &amp; en∣dowed the same with most ample reuenues. All the houses of this citie are indifferently beautifull, being built of excellent stones, and adorned with much painting and caruing. They haue verie artificiall pargettings or plai∣ster-works, which they beautifie with orient colours: for wood to carue vp∣on is verie scarce at Tunis. The floores of their chambers are paued with certaine shining and faire stones: and most of their houses are but of one storie high: and almost euerie house hath two gates or entrances; one to∣wards the street, and another towards the kitchin and other backe-roumes: between which gates they haue a faire court, where they may walke and con∣ferre with their friends. The bath-stoues here are far more commodious then those at Fez, though not so large and sumptuous. In the suburbs are many pleasant gardens which yeeld fruit, albeit not in great abundance, yet verie excellent: pome-citrons, roses, and other flowers here are great store, especially in that place which they call Bardo, where the king hath built a palace amidst those beautifull and sweete gardens. On all sides of the citie within fower or fiue miles, there growe such plentie of oliues, that the oyle thereof sufficeth not onely the citie, but is carried also in great quantitie into Egypt. The wood of the oliue-trees which they cut downe they vse to burne and to make char-coales thereof: neither do I thinke any place to be more destitute of wood then this. Pouertie constraineth some of their women to lead an vnchast life: they are decently apparelled, and go∣ing foorth of the house, they weare vailes or maskes before their faces, like vnto the women of Fez: for with one linnen-cloath they couer their fore∣heads, and ioine thereto another which they call Setfari: but about their heads they lap such fardels of linnen, as they seeme comparable to the heads of Giants. Most part of their substance and labour they bestow vpon perfumes and other such vanities. They haue here a compound called Lhasis, whereof whosoeuer eateth but one ounce falleth a laughing, dispor∣ting, and dallying, as if he were halfe drunken; and is by the said confection maruellously prouoked vnto lust.</P>

<HEAD>Of the king of Tunis his court, and of the rites and ceremonies there vsed.</HEAD>
<P>SO soone as the king of Tunis hath by inheritance attained to his king∣dome, all his nobles, doctors, priestes, and iudges, binde themselues by solemne oth vnto him. Immediately after any kings death, his sonne and heire apparent succeedeth in the kingdome: then the chiefe officer of the court (called the Munafid, because he is the kings vice-roy or high de∣putie) presenteth himselfe foorthwith vnto the new king, and giueth vp an account of all things which he did while the olde king liued: and then at the kings appointment euerie of the nobles receiue offices from the Munafid according to their seuerall places of dignitie. Another principall officer there is, called the Mesuare, that is, the great commander and gouernour of the warlike forces: who hath authoritie to increase or diminish the number of soldiers, to giue them their pay, to leuie armies, and to conduct the same whither he thinketh good. The third officer in dignitie is the Castellan, who with his soldiers taketh charge of the castle, and looketh to the sauegarde of the kings owne person: and he allotteth punishments vnto such prisoners as are brought into the said castle, as if he were the king himselfe. The fourth officer is the gouernour of the citie, whose dutie is to administer iustice in the common wealth, aud to punish malefactors. The fift officer is the kings secretarie, who hath authoritie to write, and to giue answere in the kings name: he may open also and read any letters whatsoeuer, except such as are sent vnto the Castellan and gouernour of the citie. The sixt is the kings chiefe chamberlaine, who is to furnish the walles with hangings, to appoint vnto euery man his place, and by a messenger to assemble the kings coun∣sellours, and this man hath great familiaritie with the king, and hath accesse to speake with him, as often as he pleaseth. The seuenth in dignitie is the kings treasurer, who receiueth all customes, tributes, and yeerely reuenues, and paieth them, with the kings consent, vnto the Munafid. The eight offi∣cer is he that receiueth tribute for merchandize that are brought by land, who taketh custome also of forren merchants, which are constrained for the value of euery hundred duckats to pay two duckats and a halfe: this customer hath many spies and officers, who hauing intelligence of any merchants ar∣riuall, they bring him foorthwith before their master, in whose absence they keepe him so long in their custodie, till their said master be present, and till the merchant hath deliuered all such custome as is due, and then being bound with many othes, he is dismissed. The ninth officer receiueth tribute onely of such wares as are brought by sea, and dwelleth in a house by the ha∣uens side. The tenth is the steward of the kings houshold, who is to prouide bread, meate, and other necessarie victuals, and to apparell all the kings wiues, eunuches, and the Negro-slaues that attend vpon him. He also taketh charge of the kings sonnes and of their nurses, and allotteth busines vnto
<PB N="251" REF="162"/>
the Christian captiues. These are the chiefe officers vnder the king of Tunis: the residue (least I should seeme tedious to the reader) I haue of purpose omitted to intreate of. The king of Tunis hath fifteene hundred most choise soldiers, the greatest part of whom are Renegadoes or backsliders from the Christian faith: and these haue liberall pay allowed them. They haue a cap∣taine ouer them also, who may increase or diminish their number as he pleaseth. Also there are an hundred and fiftie soldiers being Moores, who haue authoritie to remoue the tents of the kings armie from place to place. There are likewise a certaine number of crossebowes, which attend vpon the king whithersoeuer he rideth: but next of all to the kings person is his garde of Christians, which (as we signified before) dwell in the suburbs. Before the king marcheth a garde of footemen, being all of them Turkish archers, and gunners. Immediately before the king goe his lackies or footemen. One there is that rideth on the one side of the king, carrying his partizan, another on the other side beareth his target, and the third comming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him carrieth his crossebowe. Others there are also that attend vpon the king, whom (for breuities sake) we omit here to speake of. These are the principall rites and ceremonies of the ancient kings of Tunis, being much different from them which are vsed by the king that now is. I could here make a large discourse of the kings vices that now raigneth (at whose hands I confesse my selfe to haue receiued great benefits) but that is not my purpose at this pre∣sent: this one thing I can affirme, that he is maruellous cunning to procure money out of his subiects purses. But he himselfe liueth sometimes in his palace, and sometimes in gardens, in the companie of his concubines, musi∣cians, stage-plaiers, and such like. When he calleth for any musician, he is brought in blindfold or hoodwinked in manner of a hawke. The golden coine of Tunis containeth fower and twenty charats apeece, that is to say, a duckat and one third part of the coine of Europe: there is a kinde of siluer∣money coined also being fower square in forme, which waieth sixe charats apeece: and thirtie or two and thirtie of these peeces are equall in value to one peece of their gold coine, and they are called Nasari: the Italians call the gold-coine of Tunis Doble.

<HEAD>Of the great citie of Cairaoan.</HEAD>
<P>THE famous citie of Cairaoan otherwise called Caroen, was founded by <HI>Hucba,</HI> who was sent generall of an armie out of Arabia deserta, by <HI>Hutmen</HI> the thirde Mahumetan Califa. From the Mediterran sea this
<PB N="255" REF="164"/>
citie is distant sixe and thirtie, and from Tunis almost an hundred miles; neither was it built (they say) for any other purpose, but onely that the Arabian armie might securely rest therein with all such spoiles as they woone from the Barbarians, and the Numidians. He enuironed it with most impregnable walles, and built therein a sumptuous temple, supported with stately pillers. The saide <HI>Hucba</HI> after the death of <HI>Hutmen</HI> was ordai∣ned prince of Muchauia, and gouerned the same till the time of <HI>Qualid Ca∣lifa</HI> the sonne of <HI>Habdul Malic,</HI> who as then raigned in Damasco: this <HI>Qualid</HI> sent a certaine captaine called <HI>Muse</HI> the sonne of <HI>Nosair,</HI> with an huge armie vnto Cairaoan: who hauing staied a fewe daies with his armie not farre from Cairaoan, marched westward, sacking and spoiling townes and cities, till he came to the Ocean sea shore, and then he returned towards Cairaoan againe. From whence he sent as his deputie a certaine captaine into Mauritania, who there also conquered many regions and cities. Inso∣much that <HI>Muse</HI> being mooued with a iealous emulation, commanded him to staie till himselfe came. His said Deputie therefore called <HI>Tarich</HI> encam∣ped himselfe not far from Andaluzia, whither <HI>Muse</HI> within 4. months came vnto him with an huge armie. From whence both of them with their armies crossing the seas, arriued in Granada, and so marched by lande against the Goths. Against whom <HI>Theodoricus</HI> the king of Goths opposing himselfe in battaile, was miserablie vanquished. Then the foresaide two captaines with all good successe proceeded euen to Castilia, and sacked the citie of Toledo, where amongst much other treasure, they founde many reliques of the saints, and the very same table whereat Christ sate with his blessed Apostles, which being couered with pure gold and adorned with great store of precious stones, was esteemed to be woorth halfe a million of ducates, and this table <HI>Muse</HI> carrying with him as if it had beene all the treasure in Spaine, returned with his armie ouer the sea, and bent his course towarde Cairaoan. And being in the meane space sent for by the letters of <HI>Qualid Califa,</HI> he sailed into Egypt: but arriuing at Alexandria, it was tolde him by one <HI>Hescian,</HI> brother vnto the saide <HI>Califa,</HI> that the <HI>Califa</HI> his brother was fallen into a most dangerous disease: wherefore he wished him not to goe presently vnto Damasco, for feare least if the <HI>Califa</HI> died in the meane sea∣son, those rich and sumptuous spoiles should be wasted and dispersed to no ende. But <HI>Muse</HI> little regarding this counsell, proceeded on to Damasco, and presented all his spoiles to the <HI>Califa,</HI> who within fiue daies after decea∣sed. After whom his brother succeeding <HI>Califa,</HI> depriued <HI>Muse</HI> of his dig∣nitie, and substituted one <HI>Iezul</HI> into his roome, whose sonne, brother, and nephewes succeeding, gouerned the citie of Cairaoan, till such time as the familie of <HI>Qualid</HI> was depriued of that dignitie, and one <HI>Elagleb</HI> was appoin∣ted lieutenant, who gouerned not the towne as a <HI>Califa:</HI> from that time the Mahumetan <HI>Califas</HI> leauing Damasco, remooued vnto Bagaded, as we find recorded in a certaine Chronicle.

In his time also the Isle of Sicilia was woone: for <HI>Ela∣gleb</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The isle of Si∣cilie subdued by the gouernour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> sent thither a certaine captaine called <HI>Halcama,</HI> who built vpon the said Island a towne in stead of a forte, calling it according to his owne name <HI>Halcama,</HI> which name is vsed by the Sicilians euen till this present. After∣ward this new towne was besieged by certaine people that came to aide the Sicilians. Whereupon one <HI>Ased</HI> was sent with an armie, &amp; so the Moores forces being augmented, they conquered the residue of Sicilia, by which meanes the dominions of Cairaoan began woonderfully to increase. The citie of Cairaoan standeth vpon a sandie and desert plaine, which beareth no trees, nor yet any corne at all. Corne is brought thither from Susa, from Monaster, and from Mahdia, all which townes are within the space of forty miles. About twelue miles from Cairaoan standeth a certaine mountaine called Gueslet, where some of the Romaines buildings are as yet extant: this mountaine aboundeth with springs of water and carobs, which springs runne downe to Cairaoan, where otherwise they shoulde haue no water but such as is kept in cesternes. Without the wals of this citie raine water is to be found in certaine cesternes onely till the beginning of Iune. In sommer time the Arabians vse to resort vnto the plaines adioining vpon this towne, who bring great dearth of corne and water, but exceeding plentie of dates and flesh with them, and that out of Numidia, which region is almost an hundred threescore and ten miles distant. In this citie for certaine yeeres the studie of the Mahumetan lawe mightily flourished, so that heere were the most famous lawyers in all Africa. It was at length destroied, and replan∣ted againe with newe inhabitants, but it coulde neuer attaine vnto the for∣mer estate. At this present it is inhabited by none but leather-dressers, who sende their leather vnto the cities of Numidia, and exchange it also for cloth of Europe. Howbeit they are so continually oppressed by the king of Tunis, that now they are brought vnto extreme miserie.</P>

and his retinue haue their abode. Not farre from hence there is a certaine village, where the Christian, Mauritanian, and Turkish merchants haue their place of residence; in which place there is a great market or faire weekely kept, whither all the merchants of the Island and many Arabians from the maine land with great store of cattle and wooll doe resort. The in∣habitants of the Isle bring cloth thither to sell, which they themselues make, and this cloth togither with great store of raisins they vsually transport vnto Tunis, and Alexandria to be solde. Scarce fiftie yeeres sithence this Isle was inuaded and conquered by Christians: but it was immediately recouered by the king of Tunis. And presently after (newe colonies being heere plan∣ted) the foresaide castle was reedified; which the kings of Tunis afterwarde enioied. But after the death of king Hutmen the Islanders returned to their former libertie, and presently broke the bridge from the Island to the maine lande, fearing least they shoulde be inuaded by some land-armie. Not long after the said Islanders slaying the king of Tunis his gouernours of the Isle, haue themselues continued gouernours thereof till this present.

<P>AFfter the destruction of old Tripolis, there was built another city of that name: which city being inuironed with most high and beautifull wals, but not verie strong, is situate vpon a sandie plaine, which yeeldeth great store of Dates. The hou∣ses<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plentie of dates.</NOTE> of this citie are most stately in respect of the houses of Tunis; and heere also euerie trade and occupation hath a seuerall place. Weauers here are many. They haue no wels nor fountaines; but all their water is taken out of cesterns. Corne in this citie is at an exceeding rate; for all the fields of Tripoli are as sandie and barren as the fields of Numi∣dia. The reason whereof is, for that the principall and fattest grounds of this region are ouerflowed with the sea. The inhabitants of this region af∣firme, that the greatest part of their fields northward are swallowed vp by the Mediterran sea, the like wherof is to be seene in the territories of Monaster, Mahdia, Asfacos, Capes, the Isle of Gerbi, and other places more east∣ward, where the sea for the space of a mile is so shallow, that it will scarce reach vnto a mans nauell. Yea, some are of opinion, that the citie of Tri∣polis it selfe was situate in times past more to the north, but by reason of the continuall inundations of the sea, it was built and remooued by little and little southward; for proofe whereof there stand as yet ruines of houses drowned in certaine places of the sea. In this citie were many faire tem∣ples

and colledges built, and an hospitall also for the maintenance of their owne poore people, and for the entertainment of strangers. Their fare is verie base and homely, beeing onely the forenamed Besis made of barley meale: for that region affoordeth so small quantitie euen of barley, that he is accounted a wealthie man that hath a bushell or two of corne in store. The citizens are most of them merchants; for Tripolis standeth neere vnto Numidia and Tunis, neither is there any citie or towne of account between it and Alexandria: neither is it farre distant from the Isles of Sicilia and Malta: and vnto the port of Tripolis Venetian ships yeerly resort, and bring thither great store of merchandize. This citie hath alwaies beene subiect vnto the king of Tunis: but when <HI>Abulhasen</HI> the king of Fez besieged Tu∣nis, the king of Tunis was constrained with his Arabians to flee into the de∣serts. Howbeit when <HI>Abulhasen</HI> was conquered, the king of Tunis retur∣ned to his kingdome: but his subiects began to oppose themselues against him: and so that common-wealth was afterward grieuously turmoyled with ciuill dissensions and warres. Whereof the king of Fez hauing intelligence, marched the fifth yeere of the said ciuill warre with an armie against the ci∣tie of Tunis, and hauing vanquished the king thereof, and constrained him to flee vnto Constantina, he so straitly besieged him, that the citizens of Constantina seeing themselues not able to withstād the king of Fez, opened their citie gates to him and to all his armie. Whereupon the king of Tunis was carried captiue vnto Fez, and was afterward kept a while prisoner in the castle of Septa. In the meane season Tripolis was by a Genouese fleete<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taken by a fleete of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> of twentie sailes surprised and sacked, and the inhabitants carried a∣way captiue. Whereof the king of Fez beeing aduertised, gaue the Genoueses fiftie thousand ducates, vpon condition, that he mighten∣ioy the towne in peace. But the Genoueses hauing surrendred the towne, perceiued after their departure, that most part of their ducates were coun∣terfait. Afterward the king of Tunis being restored vnto his former liberty by <HI>Abuselim</HI> king of Fez, returned home vnto his kingdome, and so the go∣uernment thereof remained vnto him and his posteritie, till <HI>Abubar</HI> the sonne of <HI>Hutmen</HI> togither with his yoong sonne was slaine in the castle of Tripolis by a nephew of his, who afterward vsurped the kingdome: but he was slaine in a battell which he fought against <HI>Habdul Mumen,</HI> who present∣ly thereupon became Lord of Tripolis.

After <HI>Zacharias, Mucamen</HI> the sonne of <HI>Hesen</HI> and cosin to <HI>Zacharias</HI> was chosen king; who beginning to tyrannize ouer the citizens was by them expelled out of his kingdome: and afterward a certaine citizen was aduaunced vnto the royall throne, who gouerned verie modestly. But the king which was before ex∣pelled sent an armie of souldiers against Tripolis, who loosing the field, were all of them put to flight. Afterward the king that began to raigne so mo∣destly, prooued a verie tyrant, and being murthered by his kinsman, the peo∣ple made choise of a certaine nobleman, leading as then an Hermites life,

and in a manner against his will appointed him their gouernour: and so the gouernment of the citie of Tripolis remained vnto him and his posteritie, till such time as king <HI>Ferdinando</HI> sent Don <HI>Pedro de Nauarra</HI> against it: who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tripolis sur∣prized by Pedro de Nauarra.</NOTE> on the sudden encountring this citie, carried away many captiues with him.

<HEAD>Of the citie of Tesset in Numidia.</HEAD>
<P>IN the first Booke of this present discourse we said that Numidia was ac∣counted by the African Cosmographers the basest part of all Africa, and there we alleaged certaine reasons for the same purpose: we signified also in the second Booke, writing of the Prouince of Hea, that certaine cities of Numidia stood neere vnto mount Atlas. Howbeit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Error.</NOTE> Sus, Guzula, Helchem∣ma, and Capes, are within the kingdome of Tunis, albeit some would haue them situate in Numidia. But my selfe following the opinion of <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> suppose Tunis to be a part of Barbarie. Being therefore about to describe all the cities and townes of Numidia, I will first begin with Tesset: which ancient towne built by the Numidians neere vnto the Libyan deserts, and enuironed with walles of sunne-dried bricke, deserueth scarcely the name of a towne; and yet containeth fower hundred families. It is compassed round about with sandie plaines, sauing that neer vnto the towne grow some store of dates, of mill-seed, and of barley, which the miserable townesmen vse for food. They are constrained also to pay large tribute vnto the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in∣habiting the next deserts. They exercise traffique in the land of Negroes and in Guzula, insomuch that they spend most of their time in forren regi∣ons. They are of a blacke colour, and destitute of all learning. The wo∣men indeed teach their yoong children the first rudiments of learning, but
<PB N="267" REF="170"/>
before they can attaine to any perfection, they are put to labour, and to the plough-tayle. The said women are somewhat whiter then other women: some of them get their liuing by spinning and carding of wooll, and the re∣sidue spend their time in idlenes. Such as are accounted richest in this re∣gion, possesse but verie few cattell. They till their ground with an horse and a camell, which kinde of plowing is obserued throughout all Numidia.</P>

<P>THis village situate vpon the Numidian desert neere vnto Libya, is in∣habited by most miserable and grosse people.

<P>FOwer castles there are called by this name, built by the Numidians three miles each from other vpon a certaine riuer, which in the heat of sommer is destitute of water. Neere vnto these castles are certaine fields greatly abounding with dates. The inhabitants are verie rich, for they haue traffique with the Portugals at the port of Gart Guessem, whose wares<NOTE PLACE="marg">The port of Gart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Gualata and Tombuto.

Euery<NOTE PLACE="marg">Copper-mines.</NOTE> castle hath a weekly market; but corne and flesh are at an extreme rate there.

<P>THree castles of this name built vpon the Numidian deserts not far from Lybia were in times past well stored with inhabitants, but at length by ciuill wars they were vtterly dispeopled.

Neither haue the poore in∣habitants any thing to do, but onely to gather dates.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Prouince of Dara.</HEAD>
<P>THis Prouince beginning at mount Atlas extendeth it selfe southward by the deserts of Lybia almost two hundred and fiftie miles, and the bredth thereof is verie narrow. All the inhabitants dwell vpon a cer∣taine riuer which is called by the name of the Prouince. This riuer some∣time so ouerfloweth, that a man would thinke it to be a sea, but in sommer it so diminisheth, that any one may passe ouer it on foote. If so be it ouerflow∣eth about the beginning of Aprill, it bringeth great plentie vnto the whole region: if not, there followeth great scarcitie of corne. Vpon the banke of this riuer there are sundrie villages and hamlets, and diuers castles also, which are enuironed with walles made of sunne-dried bricke and mortar. All their beames and planchers consist of date-trees, being notwithstanding vn∣fit for the purpose; for the wood of date-trees is not solid, but flexible and spungie. On either side of the said riuer for the space of fiue or sixe miles, the fields abound exceedingly with dates, which with good keeping will last many yeeres: and as here are diuers kindes of dates, so they are sold at sun∣dry prices: for a bushell of some is woorth a duckat, but others wherewith they feede their horses and camels, are scarce of a quarter so much value. Of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The strange propertie of the palme or date∣tree.</NOTE> date-trees some are male and some are female: the male bring foorth flow∣ers onely, and the female fruit: but the flowers of the female will not open, vnlesse the boughes and flowers of the male be ioined vnto them: And if they be not ioined, the dates will prooue starke naught and containe great stones. The inhabitants of Dara liue vpon barlie and other grosse meate: neither may they eate any bread but onely vpon festiuall daies. Their castles are inhabited by goldsmithes and other artificers, and so are all the regions lying in the way from Tombuto to Fez: in this prouince also there are three or fower proper townes, frequented by merchants and strangers, and containing many shops and temples. But the principall towne called Beni Sabih, and inhabited with most valiant and liberall people, is diuided into two parts, either part hauing a seuerall captaine or gouernour: which gouer∣nours are oftentimes at great dissension, and especially when they moisten their arable grounds, by reason that they are so skanted of water. A merchant they will most courteously entertaine a whole yeere together, and then friendly dismissing him, they will require nought at his hands, but wil accept such liberalitie as he thinkes good to bestow vpon them. The said gouer∣nours so often as they fall a skirmishing, hire the next Arabians to aide them, allowing them daily halfe a duckat for their pay and somtimes more, and giuing them their allowance euery day. In time of peace they trim their harquebuzes, handguns, &amp; other weapons: neither saw I euer (to my remem∣brance) more cunning harquebuziers then at this place. In this prouince groweth great store of Indico being an herbe like vnto wilde woad, and this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indico.</NOTE> herbe they exchange with the merchants of Fez and Tremisen for other
<PB N="269" REF="171"/>
wares. Corne is very scarce among them, and is brought thither from Fez and other regions, neither haue they any great store of goats or horses, vnto whom in stead of prouender they giue dates, and a kinde of herbe also which groweth in the kingdome of Naples, and is called by the Neapolitans Far∣fa. They feede their goates with the nuts or stones of their dates beaten to powder, whereby they grow exceeding fat, &amp; yeeld great quantitie of milke. Their owne foode is the flesh of camels and goates, being vnsanorie and displeasant in taste. Likewise they kill and eate ostriches, the flesh whereof<NOTE PLACE="marg">The flesh of the Ostrich.</NOTE> tasteth not much vnlike to the flesh of a dunghill-cocke, sauing that it is more tough and of a stronger smell, especially the ostriches leg, which con∣sisteth of slimie flesh. Their women are faire, fat, and courteous: and they keepe diuers slaues which are brought out of the land of Negros.</P>

<HEAD>Of the prouince of Segelmesse.</HEAD>
<P>THis prouince called Segelmesse, according to the name of the princi∣pall citie therein contained, beginneth not farre from the towne of Gherseluin, and stretcheth southward by the riuer of Ziz an hundred and twentie miles, euen to the confines of the Libyan deserts. The said pro∣uince is inhabited by certaine barbarous people of the families of Zeneta, Zanhagia, and Haoara, and was in times past subiect vnto a certaine prince, which bare rule ouer the same prouince onely. Afterward it fell into the pos∣session of king <HI>Ioseph</HI> of the Luntune-family, and then into the hands of one <HI>Muahidin,</HI> and not long after it was enioied by the king of Fez his sonne. But since that time, the prince of this region was slaine in a rebellion, and the citie of Segelmesse was destroied, and till this day remaineth desolate. Afterward the inhabitants built certaine castles, whereof some are at liber∣tie, and others are subiect to the Arabians.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the prouince of Cheneg.</HEAD>
<P>THis region extending it selfe by the riuer of Ziz vnto mount Atlas, containeth many castles, and bringeth forth great abundance of dates, which dates are but of small value. Their fields are barren and of little circuit, saue onely betweene the riuer Ziz and the foote of mount Atlas, where some store of barlie vseth to grow. The inhabitants are some of them subiect to the Arabians, others to the citie of Gherseluin, and the residue liue at their owne libertie. And vnto these the high way leading from Segel∣messe to Fez is subiect, and they exact great tribute of the merchants tra∣uelling the same way. Neere vnto the said high way stand three castles, the first whereof being situate vpon an exceeding high rocke, seemeth to touch the cloudes. Vnder this castle there is a certaine house where a garde of sol∣diers continually stand, who for the load of euery camell that passeth by, de∣mand one fourth part of a duckat. The second castle being fifteene miles
<PB N="270" REF="172"/>
distant from the first, standeth not vpon an hill but on a plaine, and is farre more stately and rich then the former. The thirde castle called Tammara∣crost is situate vpon the common high way about twenty miles southward of the second. There are certaine villages also, and other castles of meaner account. Corne is maruellous scarce among them: but they haue goates great plentie, which in winter they keepe in certaine large caues, as in places of greatest safetie, whereinto they enter by a most narrow passage. Likewise the entrance into this region for the space of fortie miles is so narrow, that two or three armed men onely may withstand mighty forces.</P>

<P>THis region beginning southward from the region last described, con∣taineth many castles built vpon the riuer of Ziz, the principall where∣of is called Helel, wherein remaineth the gouernour of the whole re∣gion being an Arabian by birth. The soldiers of this Arabian gouernour dwell in tents vpon the plaines: and he hath other soldiers attending vpon his owne person also, who will suffer no man to passe but vnder safe conduct, without depriuing him of all his goods.

It containeth many castles, and yeeldeth plentie of dates. The inha∣bitants are subiect vnto the Arabians, being extremely couetous, and so faint harted, that an hundred of them dare scarce oppose themselues against ten Arabians: they till the Arabians ground also as if they were their slaues. The east part of Retel bordereth vpon a certaine desolate mountaine, and the west part vpon a desert and sandie plaine, whereunto the Arabians retur∣ning home from the wildernes, do resort.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the territorie of Segelmesse.</HEAD>
<P>THis territorie extending it selfe along the riuer of Ziz from north to south almost twenty miles, containeth about three hundred and fiftie castles, besides villages and hamlets: three of which castles are more principall then the rest. The first called Tenegent, and consisting of a thou∣sand and moe families, standeth neere vnto the citie of Segelmesse, and is inhabited with great store of artificers. The second called Tebuhasan, stan∣deth about eight miles to the south of Tenegent, being furnished also with greater numbers of inhabitants, and so frequented with merchants, that there is not in that respect the like place to be found in all the whole region
<PB N="271" REF="172"/>
besides. The third called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is resorted vnto by sundry merchants, both Iewes and Moores. These three castles haue three seuerall gouernours, who are at great dissension among themselues. They will oftentimes destroy one anothers chanels, whereby their fieldes are watered, which cannot without great cost be repaired againe. They will stow the palme-trees also to the very stocks: and vnto them a companie of lewd Arabians associate themselues. They coine both siluer and gold-money: but their gold is not very speciall. Their siluer coine weigheth fower graines <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, eightie of which peeces are esteemed to be woorth one peece of their gold-coine. The Iewes and Arabians pay excessiue tribute here. Some of their principall men are ex∣ceeding rich, and vse great traffique vnto the land of Negros: whither they transport wares of Barbarie, exchanging the same for gold and slaues. The greatest part of them liue vpon dates, except it be in certaine places where<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infinit num∣bers of Scorpi∣ons.</NOTE> some corne grow. Here are infinite numbers of scorpions, but no flies at all. In summer-time this region is extremely hot, and then are the riuers so de∣stitute of water, that the people are constrained to draw salt water out of cer∣taine pits. The said territorie containeth in circuit about eightie miles, all which, after the destruction of Segelmesse, the inhabitants with small cost walled round about, to the ende they might not be molested by continuall inrodes of horsemen. While they liued all at vnitie and concord, they re∣tained their libertie: but since they fell to mutuall debate, their wall was ra∣zed, and each faction inuited the Arabians to helpe them, vnder whom by little and little they were brought in subiection.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the towne or citie of Segelmesse.</HEAD>
<P>SOme are of opinion that this towne was built by a certaine Romaine captaine, who hauing conducted his troupes foorth of Mauritania, con∣quered all Numidia, and marching westward, built a towne, and called it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, bicause it stoode vpon the borders of Messa, and was as it were the seale of all his victories, and afterward by a corrupt worde it began to be called Segelmesse. The common people togither with one of our African Cosmographers, called <HI>Bicri,</HI> suppose that this towne was built by <HI>Alexan∣der</HI> the great, for the reliefe of his sicke and wounded soldiers. Which opi∣nion seemeth not probable to me: for I coulde neuer read that <HI>Alexander</HI> the great came into any part of these regions. This towne was situate vpon a plaine neere vnto the riuer of Ziz, and was enuironed with most stately and high wals, euen as in many places it is to be seene at this present. When the Mahumetans came first into Africa, the inhabitants of this towne were subiect vnto the family of Zeneta; which family was at length dispossessed of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by king <HI>Ioseph</HI> the son of <HI>Tesfin,</HI> of the family of Luntuna. The towne it selfe was very gallantly builte, and the inhabitants were rich, and had great traffike vnto the land of Negros. Heere stoode stately tem∣ples and colleges also, and great store of conducts, the water whereof was
<PB N="272" REF="173"/>
drawen out of the riuer by wheeles. The aire in this place is most temperate and holesome, sauing that in winter it aboundeth with ouermuch moisture, which breedeth some diseases. But now since the towne was destroied, the inhabitants began to plant themselues in the next castles and villages, as we haue before signified. I my selfe aboade in this region almost seuen mo∣neths at the foresaid castle of Meniun.</P>

Flesh is very scarce among them: for their soile is so drie, that it will scarce nourish any cattell at all: they keepe a few goates indeede for their milks sake: but the flesh that they eate is of camels, which the Arabians bring vnto their markets to sell: they mingle their meate with salt tallow, which is brought into this region from Fez &amp; Tremizen. There were in times past many rich Iewes in this re∣gion, who by the meanes of a certaine Mahumetan preacher, were at length expelled, and a great part of them slaine by the seditious people; and that in the very same yeere when the Iewes were expelled out of Spaine and Sicily.

From Nun it is distant southward about three hundred, from Tombuto northward fiue hundred, and from the Ocean sea about two hundred miles. In this region the people of Libya, while they were lords of the land of Negros, ordained their chiefe princely seate: and then great store of Barbarie-merchants frequen∣ted Gualata: but afterward in the raigne of the mighty and rich prince <HI>Heli,</HI> the said merchants leauing Gualata, began to resort vnto Tombuto and Ga∣go, which was the occasion that the region of Gualata grew extreme beg∣gerly. The language of this region is called Sungai, and the inhabitants are blacke people, and most friendly vnto strangers. In my time this region was conquered by the king of Tombuto, and the prince thereof fled into the de∣serts,
<PB N="286" REF="180"/>
whereof the king of Tombuto hauing intelligence, and fearing least the prince would returne with all the people of the deserts, graunted him peace, conditionally that he should pay a great yeerely tribute vnto him, and so the said prince hath remained tributarie to the king of Tombuto vntill this present. The people agree in manners and fashions with the inhabitants of the next desert. Here groweth some quantitie of Mil-seed, and great store<NOTE PLACE="marg">This round and white pulse is called Maiz in the west Indies.</NOTE> of a round &amp; white kind of pulse, the like whereof I neuer saw in Europe; but flesh is extreme scarce among them.

<P>THis kingdome called by the merchants of our nation Gheneoa, by the natural inhabitants thereof Genni, and by the Portugals and other people of Europe Ghinea, standeth in the midst betweene Gualata on the north, Tombuto on the east, and the kingdome of Melli on the south. In length it containeth almost fiue hundred miles, and extendeth two hun∣dred<NOTE PLACE="marg">The naturall commodities of Ghinea.</NOTE> and fiftie miles along the riuer of Niger, and bordereth vpon the Ocean sea in the same place, where Niger falleth into the saide sea. This place exceedingly aboundeth with barlie, rice, cattell, fishes, and cotton: and their cotton they sell vnto the merchants of Barbarie, for cloth of Eu∣rope, for brazen vessels, for armour, and other such commodities. Their coine is of gold without any stampe or inscription at all: they haue certaine iron-money also, which they vse about matters of small value, some peeces whereof weigh a pound, some halfe a pound, and some one quarter of a pound. In all this kingdome-there is no fruite to be found but onely dates, which are brought hither either out of Gualata or Numidia. Heere is nei∣ther towne nor castle, but a certaine great village onely, wherein the prince of Ghinea, together with his priestes, doctors, merchants, and all the principall men of the region inhabite. The walles of their houses are built of chalke, and the roofes are couered with strawe: the inhabitants are clad in blacke or blew cotton, wherewith they couer their heads also: but the priests and doctors of their law go apparelled in white cotton. This region during the three moneths of Iulie, August, and September, is yeerely enui∣roned with the ouerflowings of Niger in manner of an Island; all which time the merchants of Tombuto conueigh their merchandize hither in certaine Canoas or narrow boats made of one tree, which they rowe all the day long, but at night they binde them to the shore, and lodge themselues vpon the lande.

They haue often skirmishes with those that refuse to pay tribute, and so many as they take, they sell vnto the merchants of Tombuto. Here are verie few horses bred, and the merchants and courtiers keepe certaine little nags which they vse to trauell vpon: but their best horses are brought out of Barbarie. And the king so soone as he heareth that any merchants are come to towne with horses, he commandeth a certaine number to be brought before him, and chusing the best horse for himselfe, he payeth a most liberall price for him. He so deadly hateth all Iewes, that he will not admit any into his citie: and whatsoeuer Barbarie merchants he vnderstan∣deth to haue any dealings with the Iewes, he presently causeth their goods to be confiscate. Here are great store of doctors, iudges, priests, and other learned men, that are bountifully maintained at the kings cost and charges. And hither are brought diuers manuscripts or written bookes out of Bar∣barie, which are sold for more money then any other merchandize.

<P>THE great towne of Gago being vnwalled also, is distant southward of Tombuto almost fower hundred miles, and enclineth somewhat to the southeast. The houses thereof are but meane, except those where∣in the king and his courtiers remaine. Here are exceeding rich merchants: and hither continually resort great store of Negros which buy cloth here brought out of Barbarie and Europe. This towne aboundeth with corne and flesh, but is much destitute of wine, trees, and fruits. Howbeit here is plentie of melons, citrons, and rice: here are many welles also containing most sweete and holesome water. Here is likewise a certaine place where slaues are to be sold, especially vpon such daies as the merchants vse to as∣semble; and a yoong slaue of fifteene yeeres age is sold for sixe ducates, and so are children sold also. The king of this region hath a certaine pri∣uate palace wherein he maintaineth a great number of concubines and slaues, which are kept by eunuches: and for the guard of his owne person he keepeth a sufficient troupe of horsemen and footmen. Betweene the first gate of the palace and the inner part thereof, there is a place walled round about, wherein the king himselfe decideth all his subiects controuersies: and albeit the king be in this function most diligent, and performeth all things thereto appertayning, yet hath he about him his counsellors &amp; other offi∣cers, as namely his secretaries, treasurers, factors, and auditors. It is a woon∣der to see what plentie of Merchandize is dayly brought hither, and how costly and sumptuous all things be. Horses bought in Europe for ten du∣cates, are here sold againe for fortie and sometimes for fiftie ducates a piece. There is not any cloth of Europe so course, which will not here be sold for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rich sale for cloth.</NOTE> fower ducates an elle, and if it be any thing fine they will giue fifteene du∣cates for an ell: and an ell of the scarlet of Venice or of Turkie-cloath is here worth thirtie ducates. A sword is here valued at three or fower crownes, and so likewise are spurs, bridles, with other like commodities, and spices al∣so are sold at an high rate: but of al other commodities salt is most extreme∣lie deere. The residue of this kingdome containeth nought but villages and hamlets inhabited by husbandmen and shepherds, who in winter couer their bodies with beasts skins; but in sommer they goe all naked saue their priuie members: and sometimes they weare vpon their feet certaine shooes made of camels leather.

The situation of this king∣dome is very vneeuen, some part thereof being mountainous, and the resi∣due plaine. Vpon the plaines are sundry villages inhabited by rich mer∣chants, and abounding with corne. The king of this region and all his fol∣lowers dwell in a certaine large village. The mountaines being inhabited by herdesmen and shepherds doe bring foorth mill and other graine altoge∣ther vnknowen to vs. The inhabitants in summer goe all naked saue their priuie members which they couer with a peece of leather: but al winter they are clad in skins, and haue beds of skins also. They embrace no religion at all, being neither Christians, Mahumetans, nor Iewes, nor of any other profession, but liuing after a brutish manner, and hauing wiues and chil∣dren in common: and (as I vnderstood of a certaine merchant that abode a long time among them) they haue no proper names at all, but euery one is nicknamed according to his length, his fatnes, or some other qualitie. They haue a most puissant prince, being lineally descended from the Liby∣an people called Bardoa. Horsemen he hath in a continuall readines to the number of three thousand, &amp; an huge number of footmen; for al his subiects are so seruiceable and obedient vnto him, that whensoeuer he commandeth them, they wil arme themselues and follow him whither he pleaseth to con∣duct them. They paye vnto him none other tribute but the tithes of all their corne: neither hath this king any reuenues to maintaine his estate, but onely such spoiles as he getteth from his next enimes by often inuasions and assaults. He is at perpetuall enmitie with a certaine people inhabiting<NOTE PLACE="marg">The desert of Seu.</NOTE> beyond the desert of Seu; who in times past marching with an huge armie of footemen ouer the saide desert, wasted a great part of the kingdome of Borno.

And by this meanes there were abundance of hor∣ses brought: howbeit the merchants were constrained to stay for their slaues till the king returned home conquerour with a great number of cap∣tiues, and satisfied his creditors for their horses. And oftentimes it falleth out that the merchants must stay three moneths togither, before the king

returneth from the warres, but they are all that while maintained at the kings charges. Sometimes he bringeth not home slaues enough to satisfie the merchants: and otherwhiles they are constrained to awaite there a whole yeere togither; for the king maketh inuasions but euery yeere once, &amp; that at one set and appointed time of the yeere. Yea I my selfe met with sundrie merchants heere, who despairing of the kings paiment, bicause they had trusted him an whole yeere, determined neuer to come thither with horses againe. And yet the king seemeth to be marueilous rich; for his spurres, his bridles, platters, dishes, pots, and other vessels wherein his meate and drinke are brought to the table, are all of pure golde: yea, and the chaines of his dogs and hounds are of golde also. Howbeit this king is extreamely coue∣tous, for he had much rather pay his debts in slaues then in gold.

I my selfe being in his court, a certaine noble man of Damiata brought him very rich and roiall gifts, as namely, a gallant horse, a Turkish sworde, and a king∣ly robe, with certaine other particulars that cost about an hundred and fiftie ducates at Cairo: in recompence whereof the king gaue him fiue slaues, fiue camels, fiue hundred ducates of that region, and an hundred elephants teeth of woonderfull bignes.</P>

<HEAD>Of Egypt.</HEAD>
<P>THe most noble and famous prouince of Egypt bor∣dering westward vpon the deserts of Barca, Numidia, and Libya; eastward vpon the deserts lying betweene Egypt it selfe and the red sea; and northward vpon the Mediterran sea; is inclosed southward with the land of the foresaid people called Bugiha, and with the riuer of Nilus. It stretcheth in length from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sea to the land of the people called Bugiha about fower hundred and<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 450. miles long.</NOTE>
<PB N="297" REF="185"/>
fiftie miles: but in bredth it is very narrow; so that it containeth nought but a small distance betweene both the banks of Nilus and the barren moun∣taines bordering vpon the foresaid deserts, being inhabited onely in that place where Nilus is separate from the saide mountaines: albeit towards the Mediterran sea it extendeth it selfe somewhat broader. For Nilus about fower-score miles from the great citie of Cairo is diuided into two bran∣ches, one whereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his chanell westward, returneth at length into the maine streame from whence he tooke his originall, and hauing passed about threescore miles beyond Cairo, it diuideth it selfe into two other branches, whereof the one runneth to Damiata, and the other to Rosetto. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of that which trendeth to Damiata issueth another branch, which discharging it selfe into a lake passeth through a certaine gullet or streit into the Mediterran sea, vpon the banke whereof standeth the most ancient citie of Tenesse: and this diuision of Nilus into so many streames and branches causeth Egypt (as I haue beforesaid) to be so narrow. All this prouince is plaine, and is most fruitfull for all kind of graine and pulse. There are most pleasant and greene medowes, and great store of geese and other fowles. The countrey people are of a swart and browne colour: but the citizens are white. Garments they weare which are streite downe to their wastes, and broad beneath, and the sleeues likewise are streight. They couer their heads with a round and high habite called by the Italians a Dulipan. Their shooes are made according to the ancient fashion. In sommer they weare garments of particoloured cotton: but in winter they vse a certaine garment lined with cotton, which they call Chebre: but the chiefe citizens and merchants are apparelled in cloth of Europe. The inhabitants are of an honest, cheereful, and liberall disposition. For their victuals they vse a kinde of newe and ex∣treme salt cheeses, and sowre milke also artificially congealed: which fare albeit they account very daintie, yet cannot strangers digest it, and into eue∣rie dish almost they put sower milke.</P>

<P>SInce the Mahumetans were Lords of Egypt, it hath beene diuided in∣to three parts. For the region from Cairo to Rosetto is called the shore of Errif: and from Cairo to the lande of Bugiha it is called Sa∣hid, that is to say, The firme land: but the region adioining vpon that branch of Nilus which runneth towardes Damiata and Tenesse, they call by the name of Bechria or Maremma. All Egypt is exceeding fertile: but the pro∣uince of Sahid excelleth the two other parts for abundance of corne, cattle, fowles, and flaxe: and Maremma aboundeth with cotton and sugar. How∣beit the inhabitants of Marremma and Errif are farre more ciuill then the people of Sahid: bicause those two prouinces lie neerer vnto the sea, and are more frequented by European, Barbarian, and Assirian merchants: but

the people of Sahid haue no conuersation with strangers, except it be with a fewe Ethiopians.</P>

<HEAD>Of the ancient pedigree and originall of the Egyptians.</HEAD>
<P>THe Egyptians (as <HI>Moses</HI> writeth) fetch their originall from<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 10. 6.</NOTE> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mesraim is recorded to be the brother of Chus, and the sonne of Cham. Chibith.</NOTE> <HI>Mesraim</HI> the sonne of <HI>Chus,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Cham,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Noe;</HI> and the Hebrewes call both the countrie and the in∣habitants of Egypt by the name of Mesraim. The Arabians call Egypt it selfe Mesre, but the inhabitants Chibith. And Chibith (they say) was the man, that first tooke vpon him the gouernment of this region, and began first to builde houses thereon. Also the inhabi∣tants call themselues by the same name: neither are there left any true Egyp∣tians, besides a fewe Christians, which are at this present remaining. The residue embracing the Mahumetan religion haue mingled themselues amongst the Arabians &amp; the Moores. This kingdome was gouerned many yeeres by the Egyptians themselues, as namely by the kings that were cal∣led <HI>Pharao,</HI> (who by their monuments and admirable buildings, seeme to haue beene mightie princes) and also by the kings called <HI>Ptolomaei.</HI> After∣ward being subdued vnto the Romaine Empire, this kingdome since the comming of Christ was conuerted vnto the Christian religion, vnder the saide Romaine gouernment: since the decay of which Empire, it fell into the possession of the Emperours of Constantinople; who being very care∣full to maintaine this kingdome, were at length depriued thereof by the Ma∣humetans, vnder the conduct of <HI>Hamrus</HI> the sonne of <HI>Hasi,</HI> being appointed captaine generall ouer the Arabian armie of <HI>Homar</HI> the second Califa or Mahumetan patriarke of that name: who permitting all men to haue their owne religion required nought but tribute at their hands. The said captaine built vpon the banke of Nilus a certaine towne called by the Arabians Fu∣stato, which word signifieth in their language a tabernacle: for when he first vndertooke this expedition, he marched through wilde and desert places voide of inhabitants, so that his armie was constrained to lye in tents. The common people call this towne Mesre Hatichi, that is to say, the auncient citie; which notwithstanding in comparison of Cairo may not vnfitly be called the New citie. And as concerning the situation of this towne many excellent men both Christians, Iewes, and Mahumetans haue in these our times beene deceiued. For they thinke Mesre to be situate in the same place where king <HI>Pharao</HI> in the time of <HI>Moses,</HI> and king <HI>Pharao</HI> in the time of <HI>Io∣seph</HI> had their aboade: because they suppose the towne of <HI>Pharao</HI> to haue stood in that part of Africa where Nilus stretcheth out one of his armes westward towards Africa, and where the Pyramides are as yet to be seene: which the holy Scripture also seemeth to auouch in the booke of Genesis, where it is said, that the Iewes in <HI>Moses</HI> time were employed about the buil∣ding<NOTE PLACE="marg">The towne of Pharao.</NOTE> of the towne of Aphthun, which was founded by <HI>Pharao:</HI> namely in
<PB N="299" REF="186"/>
that place where Nilus trendeth towards Africa, being about fiftie miles southward of Cairo, and neere vnto the most westerly arme or branch of Nilus. They alleage also another probabilitie, that the towne of <HI>Pharao</HI> was built in the same place, because that at the verie head or confluence of the branches of Nilus there standeth a building of maruellous antiquitie, called the sepulchre of <HI>Ioseph,</HI> wherein the dead bodie of <HI>Ioseph</HI> lay, till it was<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Ioseph.</NOTE> by the Iewes transported vnto the sepulchre of their fathers. To be briefe, neither Cairo nor any place neere vnto it, can by any likelyhood chalenge that they were at any time inhabited by the ancient <HI>Pharaos.</HI> But heere it is to be noted, that the nobilitie of the ancient Egyptians dwelt in times past in the region of Sahid beyond Cairo, in the cities of Fium, of Manfich∣min, and in other such famous cities. Howbeit after Egypt was conquered by the Romans, the Egyptian nobilitie planted themselues in the region of Errif, vpon the sea shore thereof, namely about the cities of Alexandria, Rosetto, and other famous townes retayning as yet the Latine names. Also when the Roman Empire was translated into Greece, the said nobilitie still inhabited vpon the sea-shore, the Emperors lieutenant residing at Alexan∣dria: but after the Mahumetans got the dominion of Egypt, the foresaide nobilitie retired themselues into the inland, hoping thereby to reape a dou∣ble commoditie: namely first in that they might be a meanes to pacifie the kingdome on both sides of them, and secondly that they might be free from the inuasions of the Christians, whereof they should haue beene in danger, had they remained any longer vpon the sea coast.</P>

<HEAD>Of the qualitie and temperature of the ayre in Egypt.</HEAD>
<P>THE ayre of this countrey is hot and vnholesome: and it raineth here verie seldome or neuer. And raine is the cause of many diseases in Egypt: for in rainie weather some of the Egyptians are subiect vnto dangerous rheumes and feuers; and others vn∣to a strange kinde of swelling in their priuie members: which swelling the Phisicians impute vnto salt-cheese and beefe, which are the common diet of the Egyptians. In sommer time this countrey is most extremely hot, for a remedie of which heat they build in euerie towne certaine high towers, ha∣uing one doore aloft, and another beneath, right ouer against the houses, through the tops whereof the winde passing downard, doth somewhat coole and refresh the ayre: otherwise in regard of the intollerable heat of the sun it were impossible for any man to liue there. Sometime the pestilence is so<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extreme pe∣stilence.</NOTE> hot among them, especially at Cairo, that almost euery day there die twelue thousand persons thereof. But with the French poxe I thinke that no<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French maladie most rife in Egypt.</NOTE> other countrey vnder heauen is so molested, nor that containeth so many people infected therewith. About the beginning of Aprill they reape their corne, and hauing reaped it, they presently thrash the same; neither shall you see one eare of their corne standing till the twentith of May. The in∣undation<NOTE PLACE="marg">The increase of Nilus.</NOTE> or ouerflow of Nilus beginneth about the middest of Iune, increa∣sing
<PB N="300" REF="187"/>
afterward for the space of fortie daies, and for the space of other fortie daies also decreasing: during which time all the cities and townes of Egypt are like vnto Ilands, which none can come vnto but by boates and barges. At this time also Nilus is verie fit to be sayled vpon with vessels of burthen; some whereof are so big that they will containe sixe thousand bushels of corne, and an hundreth head-cattell: and in these vessels they sayle onely downe the streame: for against the streame it were impossible for them to passe emptie. The Egyptians according to the increase of Nilus doe fore∣see the plentie or dearth of the yeere following: as we will more at large de∣clare, when we come to speake of the island of Nilus ouer against the olde citie, where the inundation of Nilus is measured. Neither is it our purpose in this place particularly to describe all the cities of Egypt, because our A∣frican writers are of diuers opinions thereabout; for some would haue E∣gypt to be a part of Africa, but others are of a contrarie minde. Diuers there are that affirme that part of Egypt adioyning vpon the deserts of Bar∣barie, Numidia, and Libya, to belong vnto Africa. Some others ascribe vn∣to Africa all those places that border vpon the principall and maine chanel of Nilus: but as for other places, as namely Manf, Fium, Semenud, Daman∣hore, Berelles, Tenesse, and Damiata, they thinke them not to be situate in Africa: which opinion I my selfe also vpon many and great reasons take to be true. Wherefore my purpose is to describe none other cities but such as stand neere the maine and principall chanell of Nilus.</P>

<P>THe great citie of Alexandria in Egypt founded by <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, not without the aduise of most famous and skilfull ar∣chitects, vpon a beautifull point of land stretching into the Me∣diterran sea, and being distant 40. miles westward of Nilus, was in times past, till it grew subiect vnto the Mahumetans, most sumptuously and strongly built, as diuers and sundry authors beare record. Afterward this citie decaying many yéeres together, was depriued of the ancient renowme and honour, and rémained in manner desolate, because no merchants of Greece, nor of any other part of Europe exercised any longer traffique
<PB N="301" REF="187"/>
therein. Howbeit a certaine craftie Mahumetan patriarke made the rude people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that by the prophecie of <HI>Mahumet</HI> most ample indulgen∣ces were granted vnto all such as would inhabite the citie or garde it for cer∣taine daies, and would bestow some almes for a publike benefite: by which wilie stratagem the citie was in short time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with forren people, which from all places resorted thereunto: by whom were built many houses neere vnto the citie-walles, and many colleges of students, and diuers monasteries for the reliefe of pilgrims. The citie it selfe is fower square, and hath fower gates to enter in at: one standing on the east side towards Nilus, another on the south side towards the lake of Buchaira, the third westward towards the desert of Barca, and the fourth towards the Mediterran sea, and the hauen; whereat stand the searchers and customers, which ransacke strangers euen to their verie shirts: for they demaund custome not onely for wares and merchandize, but also some allowance in the hundred for all kinde of mo∣ney. Neere vnto the citie-walles there are two other gates also, being diui∣ded asunder by a faire walke, and a most impregnable castle, which standeth vpon the strand or wharfe of the port commonly called <HI>Marsa el Bargi,</HI> that is to say, the port of the castle: in which port ride the principall and best ships, namely such as come from Venice, Genoa, Ragusa, with other ships of Europe. For hither resort the English, the low Dutch, the Biscaines, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ancient traf∣fique of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vnto Alex∣andria.</NOTE> Portugals, and men of all other nations in Europe for traffiques sake. How∣beit this port is most vsually frequented by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Appulia, Sicilia, and of Greece, which are Turkish ships; all which resort into this harbour to saue themselues from pirates, and from tempestuous weather. Another port there is also called <HI>Marsa Essil Sela,</HI> that is to say, the port of the chaine, wherein the ships of Barbarie, namely those of Tunis &amp; of the isle of Gerbi harbor themselues. The Christians are constrained to pay about the 10. part for all wares that they bring in &amp; carie out, but the Mahumetans pay but the 20. part: and whatsoeuer wares are caried by land to Cairo pay no custom at all. And at this present that part of the citie which is next vnto Cairo is the most famous and best furnished with merchandize brought by merchants from al places of the world. The other parts of this city are destitute both of ciuilitie &amp; inhabitants: for except one long street, and that part of the citie next the hauen which is full of merchants shops, &amp; inhabited by christians, the residue is void and desolate. Which desolation happened at that time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alexandria surprised and sacked by the king of Cyprus.</NOTE> when <HI>Lewis</HI> the fourth king of France being restored to libertie by the Sol∣dan, the king of Cyprus with a fleet partly of Venetians &amp; partly of French∣men suddenly assailed Alexandria, and with great slaughter surprized and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same. But the Soldan comming with an huge armie to rescue Alexandria, so discouraged the Cyprians, that they burnt downe the houses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselues to flight. Whereupon the Soldan repai∣ring the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and building a castle neere vnto the hauen, the citie grew by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and little into that estate, wherein it standeth at this present. In the citie of Alexandria there is a certaine high mount fashioned like vnto the place
<PB N="302" REF="188"/>
called Testaccio at Rome, whereon, although it hath no naturall situation, are found diuers earthen vessels of great antiquitie. Vpon the top of the said mount standeth a turret, where a certaine officer is appointed to watch for such ships as direct their course towards the citie, who for euery ship that he giueth notice of vnto the customers, receiueth a certaine fee: but if he chan∣ceth to fall asleepe, or to be out of the way at the arriuall of any ship, where∣of he certifieth not the customers, he paieth double for his negligence into the Soldans exchequer. Vnder each house of this citie there is a great vaul∣ted<NOTE PLACE="marg">The water of Nilus brought by a sluce into Alexandria.</NOTE> cesterne built vpon mighty pillers and arches: whereinto the water of Nilus at euery inundation is conueied vnder the walles of the citie, by a cer∣taine woonderfull and most artificiall sluce standing without the city itselfe. But these cesternes growing sometime corrupt and fowle, are often in sum∣mer the occasion of many diseases and infirmities. This citie standeth in the midst of a sandie desert, and is destitute of gardens and vines, neither is the soile round about it apt to beare corne; so that their corne is brought them from places fortie miles distant. Howbeit neere the foresaid sluce, whereby the water of Nilus is conueied into the citie, are certaine little gardens, the fruits whereof being growen to ripenes are so vnholesome, that they breed feuers and other noisome diseases among the citizens. Sixe miles westward of Alexandria, among certaine ancient buildings, standeth a piller of a woonderfull height and thicknes, which the Arabians call Hemadussaoar, that is to say, the piller of trees. Of this piller there is a fable reported, that <HI>Ptolemey</HI> one of the kings of Alexandria built it vpon an extreme point of land stretching from the hauen, whereby to the end he might defend the citie from the inuasion of forren enemies, and make it inuincible, he placed a certaine steele-glasse vpon the top thereof, by the hidden vertue of which glasse as many ships as passed by while the glasse was vncouered should im∣mediately be set on fire: but the said glasse being broken by the Mahume∣tans, the secret vertue thereof vanished, and the great piller whereon it stood was remooued out of the place. But this is a most ridiculous narration, and fit for babes to giue credit vnto. At this present there are amongst the anci∣ent inhabitants of Alexandria many Christians called Iacobites, being all<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certaine Chri∣stians called Iacobites.</NOTE> of them artizans &amp; merchants: these Iacobites haue a church of their own to resort vnto, wherin the body of S. <HI>Mark</HI> the Euāgelist lay in times past inter∣red, which hath since beene priuily stolne by the Venetians, &amp; carried vnto Venice. And the said Iacobites pay tribute vnto the gouernour of Cairo. Neither is it to be passed ouer in silence, that in the midst of the ruinous monuments of Alexandria there remaineth as yet a certaine little house built in forme of a chappell, and containing a sepulchre much honoured by the Mahumetans, wherein they affirme out of the authoritie of their Alca∣ron, that the bodie of the high prophet and king (as they terme him) <HI>Ale∣xander</HI> the great lieth buried. And thither resort yeerely great multitudes of pilgrimes from forren nations, to adore and reuerence the said sepulchre, and oftentimes to bestow large almes thereupon. Other things woorthie the

But they that impose this taske vpon the inhabitants, are men of forren countries, and especially of Barbarie, which are so lasciuiously and riotously giuen, that almost all the harlots of Egypt resort hither vnto them, who shaue off their haires to the very bones without any cizzers or rasors.</P>

<P>BY whom this ancient citie of Thebe standing vpon the westerne banke of Nilus should be built, our African chroniclers are of sundry opini∣ons. Some affirme it to be built by the Egyptians, some by the Ro∣mans, and others by the Grecians, because there are as yet to be seene most ancient monuments, partly in Latine, partly in Greeke, and partly in Egyp∣tian characters. Howbeit at this present it containeth but three hundred families in all, being most of them very stately and sumptuously built. It aboundeth with corne, rice, and sugar, and with certaine fruits of a most ex∣cellent<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fruits cal∣led Mose.</NOTE> taste called Muse.

The territorie adiacent aboundeth with date-trees which grow so thicke, that a man cannot see the citie, till he approcheth nigh vnto the walles. Here grow likewise store of grapes, figs, and peaches, which are carried in great plentie vnto Cairo.

<HEAD>A description of the huge and admirable citie of Cairo.</HEAD>
<P>CAiro is commonly reputed to be one of the greatest and most famous cities in al the whole world. But leauing the common reports &amp; opini∣ons thereof, I will exactly describe the forme and estate wherin it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1526.</NOTE> now stan∣deth. And that I may begin with the Etymology or deriuation of the name, Cairo is an Arabian word, corruptly pronounced by the people of Europe: for the true Arabian worde is El Chahira, which signifieth an enforcing or imperious mistresse. This citie built in ancient times by one <HI>Gehoar Chetib</HI> a Dalmatian slaue (as I haue before signified in the beginning of my discourse) containeth within the wals not aboue eight thousand families, being inhabited by noblemen, gentlemen, and merchants that sell wares brought from all other places. The famous temple of Cairo commonly called Gemih Hashare, that is to say, the glorious temple, was built also by the foresaide slaue, whom we affirmed to be the founder of the citie, and whose surname was <HI>Hashare,</HI> that is to say, famous, being giuen him by the Mahumetan patriarke that was his prince. This city standeth vpon a most beautifull plaine, neere vnto a certaine mountaine called Mucatun, about two miles distant from Nilus, and is enuironed with stately wals, and forti∣fied with iron gates: the principall of which gates is called Babe Nansre, that is, the gate of victory, which standeth eastward towards the desert of the red sea; and the gate called Beb Zuaila being next vnto the old citie and to Nilus; and also Bebel Futuh, that is to say, the gate of triumph, standing to∣wards the lake and the fieldes. And albeit Cairo aboundeth euerie where with all kinde of merchants and artificers, yet that is the principall streete of the whole citie which stretcheth from the gate of Nansre to the gate of Zuaila; for in it are builte most stately and admirable palaces and colleges, and most sumptuous temples, among which is the temple of Gemith El∣hechim the third schismaticall Califa of Cairo. Other temples there are of
<PB N="307" REF="190"/>
a maruellous bignes, which to describe in particular, I thinke it superfluous. Heere are many bath-stoues also very artificially built. Next of all is the streete called Beinel Casrain, containing to the number of threescore cooks or victualers shops, furnished with vessels of tinne: there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other shops also, wherein are to be solde delicate waters or drinkes made of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Delicate drinks made of all kind of fruits.</NOTE> all kinds of fruits, being for noblemen to drinke of, and these waters they keepe most charily in fine vessels, partly of glasse, and partly of tinne: next vnto these are shops where diuers confections of hony &amp; sugar, vnlike vnto the confections of Europe, are to be sold: then follow the fruiterers shops, who bring outlandish fruits out of Syria, to wit, quinces, pomegranates, and other fruits which grow not in Egypt: next vnto them are the shops of such as sell egges, cheese, and pancakes fried with oile. And next of all there is a streete of the principall artificers shops. Beyond which streete standeth a college built by the Soldan called <HI>Ghauri,</HI> who was slaine in a battaile against<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ghauri.</NOTE> <HI>Selim</HI> the great Turke. And next vnto the college are diuers rankes of dra∣pers shops. In the first ranke there is most excellent outlandish linnen cloth to be sold, as namely fine cloth of cotton brought from Balabach, and cloth called Mosall brought from Ninou of a maruellous bredth and finenesse, whereof noblemen and others of account haue shirts made them, &amp; scarffes to weare vpon their Dulipans. Besides these there are certaine mercers shops where the rich stuffes of Italy, namely silke, damaske, veluet, cloth of golde, and such like are to be bought, vnto which stuffes I neuer sawe anie comparable (to my remembrāce) in Italy, where they vse to be made. Next vnto the mercers are the woollen drapers which bring cloth out of Europe, as namely from Florence, Venice, Flanders, and other places. Next of all there are chamblets to be sold: and from thence the way lieth to the gate of Zuaila, at which gate dwell great store of artificers. Neere vnto the saide way standeth the famous Burse called Canel Halili, wherin the Persian mer∣chants dwell. It is built very stately in maner of a kings palace, and is of three stories high: beneath it are certaine conuenient roomes whither merchants for the exchange of rich and costly wares do resort: for heere do the princi∣pall and most wealthie merchants abide; whose wares are spices, precious stones, cloth of India, and such like. Next vnto the Burse standeth a streete of shops where all kinde of perfumes, namely ciuet, muske, amber, and such like are to be solde: which commodities are heere in so great plentie, that if you aske for twentie pounds of muske they will presently shewe you an hundred. Next followeth the streete of the paper-merchants where you may buie most excellent and smooth paper: heere also are to be sold iewels and precious stones of great value, which the brokers carrie from one shop to another. Then come you to the goldsmiths streete being inhabited for the most part by Iewes, who deale for riches of great importance. And next vnto the goldsmiths are certaine streetes of vpholsters or brokers, who sell the apparell and rich furniture of noblemen and other citizens at the second hande; which are not cloakes, coates, napery, or such like, but things of ex∣ceeding

In this citie also there is a most stately hospitall builte<NOTE PLACE="marg">A stately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> by <HI>Piperis</HI> the first Soldan of the Mamalucks race: the yeerely reuenues whereof amount vnto two hundred thousand Saraffi.

Then the asse falling pre∣sently<NOTE PLACE="marg">These asses are somewhat like to Banks his curtall, that plaid his prizes all England ouer.</NOTE> to the ground, and lying with his heeles vpward, maketh his belly to swell, and closeth his eies as if he were starke dead. In the meane while his master lamenting the misfortune of the asse vnto the standers by, earnestly craueth their friendly assistance and liberalitie to buie him a newe asse. And hauing gathered of each one as much money as he can get; you are much deceiued my masters (quoth he) that thinke mine asse to be dead: for the hungrie iade knowing his masters necessity hath wrought this sleight, to the end he might get some money to buie him prouender. Then turning about to the asse, he commandeth him with all speede to arise: but the asse lyeth starke still, though he command and beate him neuer so much: whereupon turning againe to the people, Be it knowen (quoth he) vnto you all, that the Soldan hath published an edict or proclamation, that to morrow next all the people shall go foorth of the citie to beholde a triumph; and that all the honourable and beautifull ladies and gentlewomen shall ride vpon the most comely asses, and shall giue them otes to eate, and the christall water of Nilus to drinke. Which words being scarce ended, the asse suddenly starteth from the ground, prancing &amp; leaping for ioy: then his master prosecuting still his narration; but (saith he) the warden of our streete hath borrowed this goodly asse of mine for his deformed and olde wife to ride vpon. At these wordes the asse, as though hee were indued with humaine rea∣son, coucheth his eares, and limpeth with one of his legges, as if it were quite out of ioint. Then saith his master; What, sir Iade, are you so in loue with faire women? The asse nodding his head seemeth to say, yea. Come on therefore sirra (quoth his master) and let vs see among all these prettie damosels, which pleaseth your fancie best. Whereupon the asse go∣ing about the companie, and espying some woman more comely and beau∣tiful then the rest, walketh directly vnto her and toucheth her with his head: and then the beholders laugh and crie out amaine: Lo, the asses paramour, the paramour of the asse. Whereupon the fellow that shewed all this sport leaping vpon the backe of his asse rideth to some other place. There is also another kinde of charmers or iuglers, which keepe certaine little birdes in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Soothsaying birds.</NOTE> cages made after the fashion of cupboords, which birds will reach vnto any man with their beaks certaine skroules contayning either his good or euill successe in time to come.

But if it ariseth to the eighteenth cubite, there is like to follow great scarcitie in regarde of too much moisture: and if the eighteenth cubite be surmounted, all Egypt is in danger to be swallowed vp by the inundation of Nilus. The officers therefore declare vnto the children the height of the riuer, and the children publish the same in all streetes of the citie, charging the people to feare God, and telling them how high Nilus is increased. And the people being astonied at the woonderfull increase of Nilus, wholy exer∣cise themselues in praiers, and giuing of almes. And thus Nilus continueth fortie daies increasing and fortie daies decreasing; all which time corne is sold very deere, because while the innundation lasteth, euery man may sell
<PB N="313" REF="193"/>
at his owne pleasure: but when the eightith day is once past, the clerke of the market appointeth the price of all victuals, and especially of corne, ac∣cording as he knoweth by the foresaid experiment, that the high and lowe grounds of Egypt haue receiued either too little, or too much, or conueni∣ent moisture: all which customes and ceremonies being duely performed, there followeth so great a solemnitie, and such a thundering noise of drums and trumpets throughout all Cairo, that a man would suppose the whole citie to be turned vpside downe. And then euery familie hath a barge ador∣ned with rich couerings and carpets, and with torch-light, and furnished with most daintie meates and confections, wherewith they solace them∣selues. The Soldan also with all his nobles and courtiers resorteth vnto that sluce or conduct, which is called the great conduct, and is compassed round about with a wall, who taking an axe in his hand breaketh the said wall, and so doe his nobles and courtiers likewise: insomuch that the same part of the wall being cast downe, which stopped the passage of the water, the riuer of Nilus is so swiftly and forcibly carried through that conduct and through all other conducts and sluces in the city and the suburbes, that Cairo at that time seemeth to be another Venice; and then may you rowe ouer all places of the land of Egypt. Seuen daies and seuen nights together the foresaide festiuall solemnitie continueth in Cairo; during which space the merchants and artificers of the citie may (according to the custome of the ancient E∣gyptians) consume &amp; spend in torches, perfumes, confections, musique, &amp; such like iollities, al their gaines that they haue gotten the whole yeere past. Without the citie of Cairo, neere vnto the suburbe of <HI>Beb Zuaila,</HI> standeth the castle of the Soldan vpon the side of the mountaine called Mochattan. This castle is enuironed with high and impregnable walles, and containeth such stately and beautifull palaces, that they can hardly be described. Paued they are with excellent marble, and on the roofes they are gilt and curiously painted, their windowes are adorned with diuers colours, like to the win∣dowes in some places of Europe; and their gates be artificially carued and beautified with gold and azure. Some of these palaces are for the Soldan and his familie; others for the familie of his wife, and the residue for his concubines, his eunuches, and his garde. Likewise the Soldan had one pa∣lace to keepe publique feastes in; and another wherein to giue audience vnto forren ambassadours, and to exalt himselfe with great pompe and ce∣remonies: and another also for the gouernours and officials of his court. But all these are at this present abolished by <HI>Selim</HI> the great Turke.</P>

<HEAD>Of the customes, rites, and fashions of the citizens of Cairo.</HEAD>
<P>THe inhabitants of Cairo are people of a merrie, iocund, and cheerefull disposition, such as will promise much, but performe little. They exer∣cise merchandize and mechanicall artes, and yet trauell they not out of their

owne natiue soile. Many students there are of the lawes, but very few of other liberall artes and sciences. And albeit their colleges are continually full of students, yet few of them attaine vnto perfection. The citizens in winter are clad in garments of cloth lined with cotton: in summer they weare fine shirts; ouer which shirts some put on linnen garments curiously wrought with silke, and others weare garments of chamblet, and vpon their heads they carrie great turbants couered with cloth of India. The women goe<NOTE PLACE="marg">The attire of the women of Cairo.</NOTE> costly attired, adorning their foreheads and necks with frontlets and chaines of pearle, and on their heads they weare a sharpe and slender bonet of a span high, being very pretious and rich. Gownes they weare of woollen cloth with streite sleeues, being curiously embrodered with needle-worke, ouer which they cast certaine veiles of most excellent fine cloth of India. They couer their heads and faces with a kinde of blacke scarfe, through which be∣holding others, they cannot be seene themselues. Vpon their feet they weare fine shooes and pantofles, somewhat after the Turkish fashion. These wo∣men are so ambitious &amp; proud, that all of them disdaine either to spin or to play the cookes: wherefore their husbands are constrained to buie victuals ready drest at the cookes shops: for very few, except such as haue a great familie, vse to prepare and dresse their victuals in their owne houses. Also<NOTE PLACE="marg">The libertie of the women of Cairo.</NOTE> they vouchsafe great libertie vnto their wiues: for the good man being gone to the tauerne or victualling-house, his wife tricking vp her selfe in costly apparell, and being perfumed with sweet and pretious odours, walketh about the citie to solace her selfe, and parley with her kinsfolks and friendes. They vse to ride vpon asses more then horses, which are broken to such a gentle pace, that they goe easier then any ambling horse. These asses they couer with most costly furniture, and let them out vnto women to ride vpon, toge∣ther with a boy to lead the asse, and certaine footmen to run by. In this citie, like as in diuers others, great store of people carrie about sundrie kindes of victuals to be sold. Many there are also that sell water, which they carrie vp and downe in certaine leather bags vpon the backs of camels: for the citie (as I said before) is two miles distant from Nilus. Others carrie about a more fine and handsome vessell with a cocke or spout of brasse vpon it, hauing a cup of Myrrhe or christall in their hands, and these sell water for men to drinke, and for euery draught they take a farthing. Others sell yoong chic∣kens<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds hatched after a strange manner in Egypt.</NOTE> and other fowles by measure, which they hatch after a woonderfull and strange manner. They put great numbers of egges into certaine ouens built vpon sundrie loftes, which ouens being moderately het, will within seuen daies conuert all the said egges into chickens. Their measures are bottom∣lesse, which being put into the basket of the buier, and filled full of chickens, they lift it vp, and so let the chickens fall into the basket. Likewise such as buie those chickens hauing kept them a few daies, carrie them about to sell againe. The cookes shops stand open very late: but the shops of other arti∣ficers are shut vp before ten of the clocke, who then walke abroad for their solace and recreation from one suburbe to another. The citizens in their
<PB N="315" REF="194"/>
common talke vse ribald and filthie speeches: and (that I may passe ouer the rest in silence) it falleth out often times that the wife will complaine of her husband vnto the iudge, that he doth not his dutie nor contenteth her suffi∣ciently in the night season, whereupon (as it is permitted by the Mahumetan law) the women are diuorced and married vnto other husbands. Among the artizans whosoeuer is the first inuentour of any new and ingenious deuise is<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reward of new and inge∣nious deuises.</NOTE> clad in a garment of cloth of gold, and carried with a noise of musitians af∣ter him, as it were in triumph from shop to shop, hauing some money giuen him at euery place. I my selfe once saw one carried about with solemne mu∣sicke and with great pompe and triumph, because he had bound a flea in a chaine, which lay before him on a peece of paper for all men to behold. And if any of them chance to fall out in the streetes, they presently goe to buf∣fets, and then a great number of people come flocking about them to see the conflict, who will not depart thence, till they haue reconciled them. Their most vsuall foode is buffles flesh and great store of pulse: when they goe to dinner or supper, if their familie be little, they lay a short and rounde table-cloth: but if their houshold be great, they spread a large cloth, such as is vsed in the halles of princes. Amongst the sundrie sectes of religion in this citie, there is one sect of the Moores called Chenesia: and this sect li∣ueth vpon horse-flesh, so that their butchers when they can heare of any halting or lame iade, buy him foorthwith, and set him vp a fatting, and ha∣uing killed him, the said sect of Chenefia come and buy vp his flesh hand∣smoothe. This sect is rife also among the Turkes, the Mamaluks, and the people of Asia; and albeit the Turkes might freely vse the foode before∣mentioned, yet doe they not inure themselues thereunto. In Egypt and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fower seuer all sects of the Ma∣humetan reli∣gion permitted in the citie of Cairo.</NOTE> in the citie of Cairo there are permitted fower seuerall sectes, differing each from other both in canon and ciuill lawes: all which sects haue their originall from the religion of <HI>Mahumet.</HI> For there were in times past fower men of singular learning, who by subtiltie and sharpnesse of wit, founde out a way to make particular deductions out of <HI>Mahumets</HI> ge∣nerall preceptes. So that each of them would interpret the opinions of <HI>Mahumet</HI> according to their owne fancie, and would euery man apply them to his owne proper sense; and therefore they must needes disagree much betweene themselues: howbeit growing famous among the com∣mon people in regard of their diuers canons &amp; precepts, they were the first authors and founders of the saide fower sects: any one of which whatsoeuer Mahumetan professeth, cannot renounce the same at his pleasure and em∣brace another sect, vnlesse he be a man of deepe learning, and knoweth the reasons and allegations of both parts. Also there are in the citie of Cairo fower principall iudges, who giue sentence onely vpon matters of great im∣portance: vnder which fower are substituted other inferiour iudges, in eue∣streete of the citie, which decide petie contentions and brabbles. And if the parties which are at controuersie chance to bee of diuers sects, the plaintife may summon and conuent the defendant before the iudge of his
<PB N="316" REF="195"/>
streete: howbeit the defendant may, if he will, appeale from him vnto the highest iudge of all, being placed ouer the fower principall iudges aforesaid, and being gouernour of the sect called Essafichia; and this high iudge hath authority to dispense withal or to disanul the decrees of the fower principal, and of all the other inferiour iudges, according as he shall see cause. Who∣soeuer attempteth ought against the canons and precepts of his owne reli∣gion, is seuerely punished by the iudge of the same religion. Moreouer, al∣beit the priests of the foresaid sects differ very much, both in their formes of Liturgie or praier, and also in many other respects, yet do they not for that diuersitie of ceremonies hate one another, neither yet do the common peo∣ple of sundrie sects fal to mutinie &amp; debate: but men indeed of singular lear∣ning &amp; much reading confer oftentimes togither, &amp; as in priuate each man affirmeth his owne sect to be the best, so likewise do they confirm their opi∣nions by subtile arguments, neither may any man vnder paine of greeuous punishment reproch any of the saide fower ancient doctors. And in verie deed they all of them follow one and the same religion, to wit, that which is prescribed in the canons of <HI>Hashari</HI> the principall doctor of the Mahume∣tans, which canons go for currant ouer all Africa, and most part of Asia, ex∣cept in the dominions of the great Sophi of Persia; who bicause he reiec∣teth the saide canons, is accounted by other Mahumetans an heretike, and a schismatike. But how such varietie of opinions proceeded from the fowre doctors aforesaid, it were tedious and troublesome to rehearse: he that is desirous to knowe more of this matter, let him read my Commentaries which I haue written concerning the lawe and religion of Mahumet, accor∣ding to the doctrine of <HI>Malich,</HI> who was a man of profound learning, and was borne at Medina Talnabi, where the body of <HI>Mahumet</HI> lieth buried: which doctrine of <HI>Malich</HI> is embraced throughout all Syria, Egypt, and Arabia: wherewith if any man be delighted, let him peruse my foresaide Commentaries, and they will satisfie him to the full. Vpon malefactors they inflict most greeuous and horrible punishment, especially vpon such as haue committed any heinous crime in the court. Theeues they con∣demne to the halter. A murther committed trecherously they punish in manner following: the executioners assistants take the malefactor one by the head, and another by the feete, and then comes the chiefe executioner with a two-hand sword, and cutteth his body in twaine, the one part where∣of adioining to the head is put into a fire full of vnslaked lime: and it is a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An horrible kind of execu∣tion.</NOTE> most strange and dreadfull thing to consider, howe the same dismembred and halfe body will remaine aliue in the fire for the space of a quarter of an hower, speaking and making answer vnto the standers by. But rebels or sedi∣tious persons they flea aliue, stuffing their skins with bran till they resemble mans shape, which being done, they carrie the saide stuffed skins vpon ca∣mels backs through euery streete of the citie, and there publish the crime of the partie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: then which punishment I neuer sawe a more dread∣full, by reason that the condemned partie liueth so long in torment: but if

<HEAD>Of the manner of creating the Soldan, and of the orders, degrees, and offices in his court.</HEAD>
<P>THe dignitie and power of the Soldan was in times past exceeding great; but <HI>Selim</HI> the great Turke in the yeere of Christ (if I be not deceiued) 1517. vtterly abolished the saide dignitie, and changed all the customes and lawes of the Soldan. And bicause it hath beene my hap<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn Leo was thrise in Egypt</NOTE> thrise to trauell into Egypt since the saide woonderfull alteration befell, I suppose it will not be much beside my purpose, if I set downe in this place such particulars as I know to be most certaine true concerning the court of the Soldan. Vnto this high dignitie was woont to be chosen some one of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> the most noble Mamaluks. These Mamaluks being all Christians at the first, and stolne in their childhoode by the Tartars out of the prouince of Circassia which bordereth vpon the Euxin sea, and being solde at Caffa a towne of Taurica Chersonesus, were brought from thence by certaine merchants vnto the citie of Cairo, and were there bought by the Soldan; who constraining them foorthwith to abiure and renounce their baptisme, caused them to be instructed in the Arabian and Turkish languages, and to be trained vp in militarie discipline, to the end they might ascend from one degree of honour to another, till at last they were aduanced vnto the high dignitie of the Soldan. But this custome whereby it was enacted, that the Soldan shoulde be chosen out of the number of such as were Mamaluks and slaues by their condition, began about 250. yeeres sithens, whenas the fa∣mily of the valiant <HI>Saladin</HI> (whose name was so terrible vnto Christians) being supported but by a fewe of the kinred, fell to vtter decay and ruine. At the same time when the last king of Ierusalem was determined to sacke the citie of Cairo, which also in regard of the sloth and cowardize of the Mahu∣metan <HI>Califa</HI> then raigning ouer it, intended to make it selfe tributary vnto the same king, the iudges and lawyers of the citie with the consent of the <HI>Califa,</HI> sent for a certaine prince of Asia called <HI>Azedudin,</HI> of the nation of Curdu, (the people whereof liue in tents like the Arabians) which <HI>Azedudin</HI>
<PB N="318" REF="196"/>
togither with his sonne <HI>Saladin,</HI> came with an armie of fiftie thousand horse∣men. And albeit <HI>Saladin</HI> was inferiour in age vnto his father, yet in regard of his redoubted valour, and singular knowledge in militarie affaires, they created him generall of the field, and gaue him free libertie to bestow all the tributes and reuenues of Egypt, as himselfe shoulde thinke expedient. And so marching at length against the Christians, he got the victorie of them without any bloudshed, and draue them out of Ierusalem and out of all Sy∣ria. Then <HI>Saladin</HI> returning backe with triumph vnto Cairo, had an intent to vsurpe the gouernment thereof: where upon hauing slaine the Califa his guard (who bare principall swaie ouer the Egyptians) he procured the death also of the Califa himselfe, being thus bereft of his guard, with a poi∣soned cup, and then foorthwith submitted himselfe vnto the patronage of the Califa of Bagdet, who was the true &amp; lawful Mahumetan prelate of Cai∣ro. Thus the iurisdiction of the Califas of Cairo (who had continued lords of that citie by perpetuall succession for the space of two hundred and thirty yeeres) surceased, and returned againe vnto the Califa of Bagdet, who was the true &amp; lawfull gouernour thereof. And so the schismaticall Califas and patriarks being suppressed, there grew a contention between <HI>Saladin</HI> and the Soldan of Bagdet, &amp; <HI>Saladin</HI> made himselfe a soueraigne of Cairo, bicause the saide Soldan of Bagdet being in times past prince of the prouinces of Mazandran and Euarizin situate vpon the riuer of Ganges, and being borne in a certaine countrey of Asia, laide claime notwithstanding vnto the do∣minion of Cairo, and intending to wage warre against <HI>Saladine,</HI> he was restrained by the Tartars of Corasan, who made inuasions and inrodes vpon him. <HI>Saladin</HI> on the other side fearing least the Christians in reuenge of the foresaid iniury would make an expedition into Syria, and considering that his forces were partly slaine in the former warres, and partly consumed by pestilence, except a few which remained for the defence and sauegard of his kingdome, began to employ himselfe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> buying of slaues that came<NOTE PLACE="marg">The originall of the Mama∣luks.</NOTE> from Circassia, whom the king of Armenia by those daies tooke and sent vnto Cairo to be sold: which slaues he caused to abiure the Christian faith and to be trained vp in feats of warre and in the Turkish language, as being the proper language of <HI>Saladin</HI> himselfe: and so the saide slaues within a while increased so exceedingly both in valour and number, that they be∣came not onely valiant souldiers and skilfull commaunders, but also gouer∣nours of the whole kingdome. After the decease of <HI>Saladin,</HI> the dominion remained vnto his family 150. yeeres, and all his successours obserued the custome of buying slaues of Circassia: but the family of <HI>Saladin</HI> growing at length to decay, the slaues by a generall consent elected one <HI>Piperis</HI> a vali∣ant Mamaluk of their owne companie to be their soueraigne Lord and Sol∣dan: which custome they afterward so inuiolably kept, that not the <HI>Soldans</HI> owne sonne nor any other Mamaluk could attaine vnto that high dignitie, vnlesse first he had beene a Christian, and had abiured his faith, and had lear∣ned also exactly to speake the Circassian and Turkish languages.

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the mightie riuer of Nilus.</HEAD>
<P>THE course of this riuer is in very deed most admirable, and the creatures therein contained are exceeding strange, as namely sea-horses, sea-oxen, crocodiles, and other such mon∣strous and cruel beasts, (as we will afterward declare) which were not so hurtfull either in the ancient times of the Egypti∣ans or of the Romaines, as they are at this present: but they became more dangerous euer since the Mahumetans were lords of Egypt. <HI>Meshudi</HI> in his treatise of the memorable thinges of his time, reporteth that when <HI>Humeth</HI> the sonne of <HI>Thaulon</HI> was lieutenant of Egypt vnder <HI>Gihsare Mutauichil</HI> the Califa of Bagdet, namely in the yeere of the Hegeira 270. there was a cer∣taine leaden image about the bignes of a crocodile found among the ruines of an old Egyptiā temple, which in regard of the Hieroglyphick characters &amp; constellations engrauen theron, serued instead of an inchantmēt against all crocodiles; but so soone as the saide lieutenant caused it to be broken in peeces, the crocodiles began then to inuade men, and to doe much mis∣chiefe. Howbeit what the reason should be, why the crocodiles betweene Cairo and the Mediterran sea are harmelesse, and those aboue Cairo to∣wards the maine land, should deuoure and kill so many persons, it goeth be∣yond my skill to determine. But, to returne vnto the description of Nilus, it increaseth (as we haue saide) for the space of fortie daies, beginning from the seuenteenth of Iune; and it continueth iust so long time in decreasing. For whereas in the higher Ethiopia it raineth most abundantly about the beginning of May, the course and inundation of the water is hindred all the moneth of May, &amp; some part of Iune, before it can attaine vnto the plaine countrey of Egypt. Concerning the originall fountaine of this riuer, there<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sundry opini∣ons concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> are manifold opinions, and all of them vncertaine. Some there are which affirme the same to spring out of the mountaines, called by themselues, The mountaines of the moone; and others say that it beginneth vpon certaine
<PB N="336" REF="205"/>
plaines situate beneath the foote of the saide mountaines, and issueth out of sundrie fountaines, being a great way distant one from another. Howbeit the former of these two auouch, that Nilus with great violence falleth down from the saide mountaines into certaine deepe caues vnder the ground, and commeth foorth againe at the foresaide fountaines. Both of which opini∣ons are false: for neuer did any man as yet see where Nilus taketh his origi∣nall. The Ethiopian merchants which resort for traffike vnto the citie of Dancala, affirme that Nilus towards the south is enlarged into such a migh∣tie lake, that no man can perceiue which way the course thereof trendeth: and that afterward being diuided into manifold branches running in seueral chanels, and stretching themselues east and west, it hindereth the passage of traueilers, so that they cannot compasse those intricate windings and tur∣nings. Likewise diuers Ethiopians inhabiting vpon the plaines in manner of the Arabians, say that many of them traueiling fiue hundred miles south∣ward to seeke their camels which were straied away in the heate of their lust, found Nilus to be in all places alike, that is to say, dispersed into manifolde armes and lakes, and that they discouered sundry desert and barren moun∣taines, where the foresaide <HI>Meshudi</HI> affirmeth emraulds to be found: which seemeth more probable then that which the same author affirmeth concer∣ning sauage men, which wander vp and downe like wilde goates, and feede vpon the grasse of the deserts in manner of beasts. But if I recorded all the fables which our writers report concerning Nilus, I shoulde seeme ouer te∣dious vnto the Reader.</P>

These hunters being acquainted with the woodes and<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of taking elephants in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> thickets where they keepe, vse to make among the trees a rounde hedge of strong boughes and raftes, leauing a space open on the one side therof, and likewise a doore standing vpon the plaine grounde which may bee lift vp with ropes, wherewith they can easily stoppe the said open place or passage. The elephant therefore comming to take his rest vnder the shady boughes, entreth the hedge or inclosure, where the hunters by drawing the saide rope and fastening the doore hauing imprisoned him, descend downe from the trees, and kill him with their arrowes, to the end they may get his teeth and make sale of them.

<HEAD>Of the Camell.</HEAD>
<P>CAmels are gentle and domesticall beasts, and are found in Africa in great numbers, especially in the deserts of Libya, Numidia, and Bar∣baria. And these the Arabians esteeme to be their principall posses∣sions and riches: so that speaking of the wealth of any of their princes or gouernors, he hath (say they) so many thousand camels, and not so manie thousand ducates. Moreouer the Arabians that possesse camels, liue like lords and potentates in great libertie, bicause they can remaine with their camels in barren deserts, whither no kings nor princes can bring armies to subdue them. These kindes of beasts are to be seene in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In all parts of the world which the author at that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> knew.</NOTE> all parts of the worlde, to wit, in Asia, Africa, and Europe. And they are vsed in Asia by the Tartars, the Curdians, the Dalemians, and the Turcomans. In Europe the Turkes vse them to carrie burthens vpon, as likewise do all the Arabians in Africa, and the inhabitants of the Lybian deserts; yea kings in their ar∣mies vse camels also, to conueigh their victuals and carriages: howbeit the African camels farre excell them of Asia; for trauailing fortie or fiftie daies togither, without any prouender at all, they are vnladen in the euening, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">The African <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are the best.</NOTE> turned loose into the next fieldes, where they feede vpon grasse, brambles, and the boughes of trees; which hardnes the camels of Asia cannot en∣dure
<PB N="338" REF="206"/>
but when they set foorth any iourney, they must be well pampered and full of flesh. Experience hath taught, that our camels hauing trauailed la∣den fiftie daies togither without any prouender; haue so wasted, first the flesh of their bunches, secondly of their bellies, and lastly of their hips, that they haue scarce beene able to carrie the weight of 100. pounds. But the mer∣chants of Asia giue their camels prouender, halfe of them being laden with wares, and the other halfe with prouender, and so their whole carouan of camels goeth foorth and returneth home laden: by which meanes they keepe them in good plight, and reape double gaines by their labour. Con∣trariwise the African merchants trauailing with merchandise into Ethiopia, bicause they returne emptie, and bring backe with them things of no great weight, so soone as they arriue with their leane and galled camels in Ethio∣pia, they sell them halfe for nought vnto the inhabitants of the deserts. And they that returne into Barbarie or Numidia, need very fewe camels; name∣ly for themselues to ride vpon, for to carrie their victuals, their money, and other light commodities. Of camels there are three kinds; whereof the first being called Hugiun are grosse, and of a tall stature, and most fit to carrie<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three kinds of camels.</NOTE> burthens, but ere fower yeeres end they grow vnprofitable: after which time euery camell but of meane stature will carrie a thousand pounds of Italian weight. When any of the saide camels is to be laden, being beaten vpon his knees and necke with a wande, he kneeleth downe, and when he feeleth his load sufficient, he riseth vp againe. And the Africans vse to gelde their camels which they keepe for the burthen, putting but one male camell among ten femals. The second kinde of camels called Becheti, and hauing a double bunch, are fit both to carrie burthens, and to ride vpon: and these are bred onely in Asia. The thirde kinde called Raguahill, are camels of a slender and low stature, which albeit they are vnfit to carry burthens, yet<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camels of a woonderfull swiftnes, other∣wise called Dromedaries.</NOTE> do they so excell the two other kindes in swiftnes, that in the space of one day they will trauell an hundred miles, and will so continue ouer the deserts for eight or ten daies togither with very little prouender: and these doe the principal Arabians of Numidia and the Moores of Libya vsually ride vpon. When the king of Tombuto is desirous to sende any message of impor∣tance vnto the Numidian merchants with great celeritie, his post or mes∣senger riding vpon one of these camels, will runne from Tombuto to Dar∣ha or Segelmesse, being nine hundred miles distant, in the space of eight daies at the farthest: but such as trauell must be expert in the way through the deserts, neither will they demaund lesse then fiue hundred ducates for euery iourney. The saide camels about the beginning of the spring incli∣ning to their lust and venerie, do not onely hurt one another, but also will deadly wound such persons as haue done them any iniury in times past, not forgetting light and easie stripes: and whomsoeuer they lay holde on with their teeth, they lift him vp on high, and cast him downe againe, trampling vpon him with their feete, and in this madde moode they continue fortie daies togither. Neither are they so patient of hunger as of thirst; for they
<PB N="339" REF="206"/>
will abstaine from drinke, without any inconuenience, for fifteene daies to∣gither:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The camels great abstinence from drinke.</NOTE> and if their guides water them once in three daies, they doe them great hurt, for they are not vsually watred but once in fiue or nine daies, or at an vrgent necessitie, once in fifteene daies. Moreouer the saide camels are of a gentle disposition, and are indued as it were with a kinde of humaine reason: for when as betweene Ethiopia and Barbarie they haue a daies iour∣ney to trauell more then their woont, their masters cannot driue them on, being so tired, with whips, but are faine to sing certaine songs vnto them; wherewith being exceedingly delighted, they performe their iourney with such swiftnes, that their saide masters are scarce able to follow them. At my being in Cairo I sawe a camell dance; which arte of dancing howe he<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Ca∣mels of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> learne to dance.</NOTE> learned of his master I will heere in fewe words report. They take a yoong camell, and put him for halfe an hower togither into a place like a bath∣stoue prepared for the same purpose, the floore whereof is het with fire: then play they without vpon a drum, whereat the camell not so much in re∣gard of the noise, as of the hot pauement which offendeth his feete, lifteth vp one legge after another in maner of a dance, and hauing beene accusto∣med vnto this exercise for the space of a yeere or ten moneths, they then present him vnto the publike view of the people, when as hearing the noise of a drum, and remembring the time when he trode vpon the hot floore, he presently falleth a dancing and leaping: and so, vse being turned into a kind of nature, he perpetually obserueth the same custome.

<P>THis name is giuen vnto the Barbarie horses throughout Italy and all Europe, bicause they come foorth of Barbarie, and are a kinde of hor∣ses that are bred in those regions; but they which so thinke are deceiued: for the horses of Barbarie differ not in any respect from other horses: but hor∣ses of the same swiftnes &amp; agilitie are in the Arabian toong called through∣out all Egypt, Syria, Asia, Arabia Felix, and Deserta, by the name of Ara∣bian horses: and the Historiographers affirme, that this kinde of wilde hor∣ses ranging vp and downe the Arabian deserts, and being broken and mana∣ged by the Arabians euer since the time of <HI>Ismael,</HI> haue so exceedingly mul∣tiplied and increased, that they haue replenished the most part of Africa: which opinion sauoureth of truth; for euen at this present there are great store of wilde horses founde both in the African and Arabian deserts. And I my selfe sawe in the Numidian desert a wilde colte of a white colour, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a curled maine. The most certaine triall of these horses is when they can ouertake the beast called Lant or the Ostrich in a race: which if they be able to performe, they are esteemed woorth a thousand ducats or an hun∣dred camels. Howbeit very fewe of these horses are brought vp in Barbarie, but the Arabians that inhabite the deserts, and the people of Libya bring vp great numbers of them, vsing them not for trauell or warfare, but onely

It goeth vpon fower feete like a Lizard, nei∣ther is it aboue a cubite and an halfe high. The taile of this beast is full of knots, and the skin thereof is so exceeding hard, that no crossebowe will en∣ter it. Some praie vpon fishes onely, but others vpon beastes and men. Which lurking about the bankes of the riuer, do craftily lay waite for men and beastes that come the same way, about whom suddenly winding their tailes, they draw them into the water, and there deuour them. Howbeit some of them are not so cruell by nature: for if they were, no inhabitants coulde liue neere vnto the riuers of Nilus and Niger. In eating they mooue the vpper iawe onely, their neather iawe being ioined vnto their breast-bone. Not many yeeres sithens, passing vp the riuer of Nilus towards the citie of Cana, standing in the vpper part of Egypt, fower hundred miles from Cai∣ro, on a certaine night whilest wee were in the midst of our iourney, the moone being ouershadowed with clouds, the marriners and passengers all fast a sleepe, and the barke vnder sailes, I my selfe studying by candle-light in my cabben, was called vpon by a deuout olde man in the barke, who be∣stowed the same night in watching and praier, and saide vnto me, call (I praie you) some of your company, who may helpe me to drawe vppe this peece of woode floting vpon the water, which will serue to morrow for the dressing of our dinner. My selfe sir (quoth I) will come and helpe you, ra∣ther then wake any of our company in the dead of the night. Nay (quoth the old man) I will trie whether I be able to drawe it vp alone or no. And so when the barke was neere vnto the woode, as he supposed, holding a rope in his hande to cast into the water; he was sodainly intangled with a crocodiles long taile, and was in a moment drawen vnder the water. Whereupon I ma∣king a shoute, all the people in the barke arose, and striking sailes wee staide for the space of an hower, diuers in the meane time leaping into the water to seeke the man, but altogither in vaine: and therefore all of them affirmed that he was caught by a crocodile. As we sailed farther we sawe great num∣bers of crocodiles vpon the bankes of Islands in the midst of Nilus lie bea∣king them in the sunne with their iawes wide open, whereinto certaine little birdes about the bignes of a thrush entring, came flying foorth againe pre∣sently after. The occasion whereof was tolde me to be this: The crocodiles<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little birds fly∣ing into the cro∣codiles mouth to picke wormes from betweene their teeth.</NOTE> by reason of their continuall deuouring of beasts and fishes, haue certaine peeces of flesh sticking fast betweene their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> teeth, which flesh being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, breedeth a kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wherewith they are cruelly tormented.

perceiuing himselfe freed from the wormes of his teeth, offereth to shut his mouth, and to deuour the little birde that did him so good a turne, but being hindred from his vngratefull attempt by a pricke which groweth vpon the birds head, he is constrained to open his iawes and to let her depart. The shee crocodile laying egges vpon the shore, couereth them with sand; and so soone as the yoong crocodiles are hatched, they crawle into the riuer. Those crocodiles that forsake the riuer and haunt the deserts become venemous; but such as continue in Nilus, are destitute of poison. In Egypt there are many that eate the flesh of the crocodile, and affirme it to be of an excellent taste. His larde or grease is solde very deere at Cairo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of taking the cro∣codile.</NOTE> and is saide to be very medicinable for olde and cankered woundes. They take the crocodile in manner following; The fishers binding a strong and large rope vnto some tree or poste standing for the nonce vpon the banke of Nilus, fasten vnto the end thereof an iron hooke of a cubite long, and about the thicknes of a mans finger, and vpon the hooke they hang a ramme or a goate, by the bleating noise whereof the crocodile being allured, commeth foorth of the water, and swalloweth vp both the baite and the hooke, where∣withal feeling himselfe inwardly wounded, he strugleth mightily, &amp; beateth the ground, the fishers in the meane time pulling and slacking the rope, till the crocodile falleth down vanquished &amp; dead: then they thrusthim in with certaine dartes and iauelins vnder the shoulders and flanks where his skin is most tender, and so make a quicke dispatch of him. His backe is so harde and thicke, that an harquebuse or caliuer will scarce pierce it. Of these beasts I sawe aboue three hundred heads placed vpon the wals of Cana, with their iawes wide open, being of so monstrous and incredible a bignes, that they were sufficient to haue swallowed vp a whole cowe at once, and their teeth were great and sharpe.

<P>IN the consulship of <HI>Marcus Plautius Hypsaeus,</HI> and <HI>Marcus Fuluius Flaccus,</HI> Africa scarce breathing from bloudie warres, an horrible and extraordinarie destruction ensued. For whereas now throughout all Africa, infinite multitudes of locustes were gathered togither, &amp; had not only quite deuoured the corne on the grounde, and consumed the herbes with part of their rootes, and the leaues and tender boughes of the trees, but had gnawne also the bitter barke, and drie woode; being with a violent and sudden winde hoised aloft in mightie swarmes, and carried a long time in the aire, they were at length drowned in the African sea. Whose lothsome and putrified carcases being by the waues of the sea cast vp in huge heapes farre and wide along the shore, bred an incredible stinking &amp; infectious smell: whereupon followed so general a pestilence of al liuing creatures, that the corrupt dead bodies of foules, cattell, and wilde beasts dissolued by the contagion of the aire, augmented the furie of the plague. But how great and extraordinarie a death of men there was, I cannot but tremble to report: for in Numidia, where <HI>Micipsa</HI> was then king, died fowerscore thousand persons; and vpon the sea-coast next adioiningto Carthage and Vtica, aboue two hundred thousand are saide to haue perished. Yea in the citie of Vtica it selfe were by this meanes swept from the face of the earth thirtie thousand braue soldiers,

And the destruction was so sudaine and violent, as they report, that out of one gate of Vtica, in one and the same day, were carried aboue fifteene hundred dead corpes of those lustie yoong gallants. So that by the grace and fauour of almightie God (through whose mercy, and in confidence of whom, I doe speake these things) I may boldly affirme; that albeit sometime in our daies the locusts in diuers parts, and vsually, doe some domage which is tolerable: yet neuer befell there in the time of the Christians so insupportable a mischiefe, as that this scourge of locusts, which being aliue are by no meanes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, should after their death prooue farre more pernicious: and which also li∣uing, the fruits of the earth would haue beene quite deuoured; it had beene much better they had neuer died, to the plague and destruction of all earthly creatures.

And so I went to the Ambassadour, and told him, that it would be very good to goe on procession, beseeching God that hee woulde deliuer the countrie, who peraduenture in his great mercie might heare vs. This liked the Ambassadour very well: and the day following we gathered togither the people of the land, with all the priests, and taking the consecrated stone, and the crosse, according to their custome, all we Portu∣gals sung the Letanie, and appointed those of the land, that they should lift vp their voices aloud as we did, saying in their language <HI>Zio marina Christos,</HI> which is as much to say, as Lord God haue mercy vpon vs: and with this manner of inuocation we went ouer a peece of grounde, where there were fieldes of wheate, for the space of a mile, euen to a little hill: and heere I<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> caused many of these locustes to be taken, pronouncing ouer them a cer∣taine coniuration, which I had about me in writing, hauing made it that night, requesting, admonishing, and excommunicating them, enioining them within the space of three howers to depart towards the sea, or the lande of the Moores, or the desert mountaines, and to let the Christians alone: and they not performing this, I summoned and charged the birdes of heauen, the beasts of the earth, and all sorts of tempests, to scatter, destroy, and eate vp their bodies: and to this effect I tooke a quantitie of locusts, making this admonition to them present, in the behalfe likewise of them absent, and so giuing them libertie, I suffered them to depart. It pleased God to heare vs sinners, for in our returne home, they came so thicke vpon our backes, as it seemed that they woulde haue broken our heads, or shoulders, so hard they strooke against vs, as if we had beene beaten with stones and cudgels, and in this sort they went towards the sea: The men, women, and children remai∣ning at home, were gotten vpon the tops, or tarrasses of their houses, giuing

God thankes that the locusts were going away, some afore, and others followed. In the meane while towardes the sea, there arose a great cloude with thunder, which met them full in the teeth, and continued for the space of three howers with much raine, and tempest, that filled all the riuers, and when the raine ceased, it was a fearefull thing to behold the dead Locustes, which were more then two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or fathomes.</NOTE> yardes in height vpon the bankes of the riuers, and in some riuers there were mightie heapes of them, so that the morning following there was not one of them found aliue vpon the earth. The peo∣ple of the places adioining hearing this, came in great numbers to en∣quire how this matter was effected; many of the inhabitants said, these Por∣tugals be holy men, and by the power of their God, they haue killed and dri∣uen away the locusts: others saide, especially the priests and friers of those places neere about, that we were witches, and by power of enchantments had driuen away the saide creatures, and that for this cause we feared neither lions, nor any other wilde beast: Three daies after this effect, there came vnto vs a Xuum, that is, a captaine of a place called Coiberia, with men, priests, and friers, to request vs, that we woulde for the loue of God helpe them, saying that they were in a manner destroied by the locustes; and that place was a daies iourney off towards the sea. They came to vs about eue∣ning, and at the same instant, I and fower other Portugals departed awaie with them, we went all night, and came thither an hower within daie, where we found, that all those of the countrey, with many of the other places ad∣ioining were assembled togither, for they were also molested by the locusts. And assoone as we were come, we went our procession rounde about the land, which was seated vpon an high hill, from whence we might discerne manie countries and places all yellow by reason of the multitude of locusts. Such inuocatious and ceremonies being ended, as we performed in the other place, we went to dinner, &amp; the men that were borderers, requested vs to goe with them, promising vs great rewardes: It pleased god, that as soon as we had dined, we saw all the earth so cleared that there was not soe much as one locust to be seene: The people seeing this and not being satisfied with the fauour and grace receiued, they requested vs to goe and blesse their pos∣sessions, for they were yet afraid least the locusts would returne; and so wee departed.</P>

and fiue Genoueses, towards a certain towne &amp; a moūtaine called Aguoan, &amp; we trauailed fiue daies through places all desert &amp; destroied, which places were sowen with Maiz, hauing stalkes as great as those props which we vse about our vines, and we might see them all broken and troden vnderfoote, as if there had beene a tempest, and this had the locusts done. Their wheate, barley, and Taffo da guza were so eaten, as it seemed they neuer had beene either tilled or sowne. The trees were without leaues, and their barkes all gnawne &amp; eaten, and there was not so much as a spire of grasse, for they had deuoured euery thing; and if we had not beene aduised, and foreseene the same (for when we departed, we laded our mules with victuals) we and our beastes had died togither for hunger. The countrey was couered all ouer with winglesse locustes; and they saide, that those were the seede of them, which had deuoured all, and that when they had gotten wings, they would go seeke out the rest, the number of these was so great, as I am loath to re∣port, bicause I shoulde not perhaps be credited: but this I may well affirme, that I sawe men, women, and children, sit as it were amazed amongst these locusts, and I saide vnto them, why sit you thus halfe dead, and doe not kill these creatures, and so reuenge your selues of the wrong, that their fa∣thers and mothers haue done you, or at least that those which you kill may be able to doe you no more harme? They answered, taht they had not the hart, to withstand the scourge of God which hee had sent vpon them for their sins: And all the people of this place departed hence, so that we found the waies full of men and women on foot, with their children in their armes, and vpon their heads, going into other countries, where they might finde victuall, and it was great pittie to behold them. We being in the saide pro∣uince of Abuguna, in a place called Aquate, there came such swarmes of lo∣custes as were innumerable: which one day began to fall vpon the grounde about nine of the clocke in the morning, and ceased not while night; where they lighted, there they staide, and then the next day in the morning went away: so that at three of the clocke in the afternoone there was not one of them to be seene, and in this short time they left the trees vtterly destitute of leaues. On the same day and hower there came an other squadron, and these left neither tree nor bough vngnawen and eaten, and thus did they for fiue daies one after an other: they said that those were yoong ones which went to seeke their fathers, and they did the like, as those we sawe without wings: the space that these locustes tooke vp, was nine miles, for which circuit there remained neither barke nor leaues vpon the trees, &amp; the coun∣trey looked not as though it had bin burnt, but as though it had snowed thereupon, and this was by reason of the whitenes of the trees which were pilled bare by the Locustes, and the earth was all swept cleane: It was Gods will that the haruest was alreadie in: wee coulde not vnder∣stande which way they afterwards went, bicause they came from the sea warde, out of the kingdome of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which belongeth to the Moores, who are continually in warre, as also we coulde by no meanes knowe

<HEAD>A briefe relation concerning the dominions, re∣uenues, <HI>forces, and maner of gouernment of sundry the greatest princes either inhabiting within the bounds of Africa, or at least possessing some parts thereof, translated, for the most part, out of Italian.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFricke hath euer beene the least knowen and haunted parte in the world, chiefly by reason of the situation thereof vnder the torride Zone; which the ancients thought to be vnhabitable. Whose opinion, although in very deede it is not true, bicause we knowe that betweene the two Tropickes there are most fruitefull coun∣tries, as namely Abassia, and the kingdomes of Angola, &amp; Congo, with all India, new Spaine, and Brasile; yet neither is it altogither false: For no part of the world hath greater deserts, nor vaster wildernes, then this of Africa. These deserts, which extend themselues from the Atlanticke Ocean euen vnto the borders of Egypt, for more then a thousand miles, and runne out sometimes two hundred, and otherwhiles 300. miles in bredth, diuide Africke into two parts: whereof the southerly part was neuer throughly knowne to the people of Europe, as also Atlas, which diuideth Numidia from Africa the lesse, is some impediment to the same: And to∣wards the east it seemeth that nature also ment to conceale the same, by those deserts that lye bewixt the Red sea and the lande of Egypt. In the first times after the floud we finde mention very often made of the kingdomes of Egypt, and Ethopia: and as for Ethiopia the notice we had thereof, was but obscure and confused: But Egypt, by reason of the commodious situation thereof betweene the Mediterran, and the Red seas, hath alwaies beene renowmed and famous: yea king <HI>Sesostris</HI> that Egyptian monarch enlarged his empire from the Atlantick Ocean, euen to the Euxine sea: Af∣terwards the kings of Numidia, &amp; Mauritania, &amp; the Carthaginians flouri∣shed in those prouinces which are bounded by the Meditterran sea. In our times, wherein all Africke hath beene and is daily enuironed, there is suffici∣ent knowledge had of the Marine parts thereof, but for the inland prouin∣ces there is not so much knowne as might be, rather through want of wri∣ters then for default of discouerie &amp; trade. Now therfore leauing those parts of Africa which are possessed by the Turke and the king of Spaine, to a
<PB N="360" REF="217"/>
briefe narration in the last place, we haue reduced al the residue of our relati∣ons to three princes: that is, to <HI>Prete Ianni,</HI> the <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> and the <HI>Xeriffo,</HI> who is king of Maroco and Fez; for the rest referring you to <HI>Iohn Leo,</HI> and the discourse prefixed before him: the <HI>Xeriffo</HI> raigneth betweene Atlas and the Atlanticke Ocean; <HI>Prete Ianni</HI> about the center of Africke: and the <HI>Monomotapa</HI> hath his Empire towards the Sinus Barbaricus, or the Barba∣rian gulphe.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Empire of Prete Ianni.</HEAD>
<P>THe Empire of <HI>Prete Ianni</HI> answereth not certainly in effect, (although it be very large) vnto the fame and opinion which the common sort, and most writers haue of it: For lateliest of any other <HI>Hor atio Malugucci</HI> in a certaine discourse of his, touching the greatnes of states at this day, would needes haue his dominion to be greater then any other princes, but the king of Spaine. I confesse indeede, that in times past his state had most ample and large confines, as may be iudged by the multitude of kingdomes, with which he adorneth and setteth foorth his stile; for he entitleth himselfe king of Goi∣ame, a kingdome seated beyond Nilus, and of Vangue, and Damut situ∣ate beyond Zaire; and yet it is at this day euidently knowne, that his Em∣pire scarcely reacheth vnto Nilus: yea and <HI>Iohn Barros</HI> writeth, that the A∣bassins haue little notice of that riuer, by reason of the mountaines lying betweene them and it. The hart or center of his state, is the lake Barcena: for on the east it extendeth from Suaquen, as farre as the entrance of the Red sea, for the space of an hundred and two and twentie leagues: howbeit betwixt the Red sea and it, there thwarteth a long ranke of mountaines, in∣habited by the Moores, who also commaund the sea-coast. On the west it hath another ridge of mountaines along the channell of Nilus, enhabited by the Gentiles, who pay tribute vnto the <HI>Prete.</HI> On the north it consineth with an imaginarie line drawne from Suaquen to the furthest part of the isle of Meroe, which is an hundred and fiue and twentie leagues long: From hence it maketh as it were a bow, but not very crooked, towards the south, euen to the kingdome of Adel (from the mountaines whereof springeth that riuer which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> calleth Raptus, and placeth to the south of Me∣linde) for the space of two hundred and thirtie leagues; all which distance is bordered vpon by the Gentiles: from whence it turneth and endeth east∣ward at the kingdome of Adel, whose head citie is Arar, in the northerly latitude of nine degrees: So that this whole empire, little more or lesse, amounteth to sixe hundred threescore and twelue leagues in circuite: The countrie (which is distinguished with ample plaines, pleasant hils, and high mountaines, most of them manurable, and well inhabited) bringeth foorth barley and myll (for it aboundeth not greatly with other sortes of graine) and likewise Taffo da guza, another good and durable seede: But
<PB N="361" REF="217"/>
there is mill, and Zaburro (which we call the graine of India, or Ginnie wheate) great plenty, with al sorts of our pulse, and some also vnknowen to vs. Some of them weare clothes of cotton: but the greater part are clad in sheeps skinnes, and those which are more honourable, in the skins of Ly∣ons, Tigres, and Ounces. They haue all kindes of our domesticall creatures, as hennes, geese, and such like, as also abundance of kine, and wild swine, harts, goates, hares, but no conies, besides panthers, lyons, Ounces, and ele∣phants. To conclude, there cannot be a countrie more apt then this, for the generation and increase of all plants and creatures. True it is, that it hath little helpe or furtherance by the industrie of the inhabitants, because they are of a sloathfull dul nature, and capacitie. They haue flaxe, and yet can make no cloath, sugar canes, and know not the arte of getting the sugar thereout; yron, and haue no vse thereof, but take all smithes to be negro∣mancers: They haue riuers, and waters, and know not how to better their possessions by them. They conceaue not greatly of hunting or fishing: whereupon the fieldes are full of birdes and wild beastes, and the riuers and lakes, of fish. An other reason of their slacknes and negligence, is the euill intreatie of the communaltie by those of the mightier sort: for the poore seeing euery thing taken from them that they haue, sow no more, then verie necessity vrgeth them vnto. Their speech also is without any rule or pre∣scription, and to write a letter, requireth a great assembly of men, and many dayes to deliberate thereon. The nobles, cittizens, and peasants liue distin∣ctly and apart, and any of these may purchase nobility by some famous, or worthie act. The first borne inherite all things.</P>
<P>There is not in all the countrie a castel, or fortified place, for they thinke, as the Spartanes did, that a country should be mayntained and defended by force of armes, and not with rampires of earth or stone. They dwell for the most part dispersed in townes and villages. Their trade of marchandise is performed by exchanging one thing for an other, supplying the ouerplus of their prises with wheat or salt: pepper, incense, myrrhe, &amp; salt, they sell for the waight in gold. In their bargaines they vse gold also, but by waight, siluer is not ordinary among them. Their greatest city is the Princes court, which is neuer firme and resident in one place, but remoueth here &amp; there, and re∣maineth in the open fieldes vnder tentes. This courte comprehendeth ten, or more miles in compasse.</P>

He weareth vsually vpon his head, a crowne halfe gold, halfe siluer, and a crosse of siluer in his hand: his face is couered with a peece of blew taffata, which he lifteth vp, or letteth downe, more or lesse, according as he fauoreth them that he treateth withall: and sometimes he only sheweth the end of his foot, which he putteth forth from vnder the said curtaines. They that carrie and returne ambassages, come not to his curtaine, but with long time, diuers ceremonies, and sundry obseruations. None hath slaues but himselfe, to whome euery yeere his subiects come to do homage. This prince (as the Abassins report) descendeth from a sonne of <HI>Salomon,</HI> &amp; the Queen of <HI>Saba,</HI> called <HI>Meilech:</HI> they receiued the faith vnder Queene <HI>Candaces,</HI> in whose time the familie of Gaspar began to raigne and flourish in Ethiopia, and from him after thirteene generations came <HI>Iohn</HI> called the holie. This man about the time of <HI>Constantinus</HI> the Emperor, be∣cause he had no children, leauing the kingdome to his brother <HI>Caius</HI> eldest sonne, inuested <HI>Baltasar,</HI> and <HI>Melchior,</HI> younger brothers, one in the kingdome of Fatigar, and the other in Giomedi: whereupon the royall blood grew to be deuided into three families, namely that of Baltafar, that of Gaspar, and the third of Melchior, ordayning that the Empire aboue all others should be giuen by election to some one of the foresaid families, soe it were not to the eldest borne. For these first borne there were particular kingdomes appointed. And to auoide scandale and tumult, hee decreed that the Emperours brothers with his neerest kindred should be enclosed as in a strong castell, within<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Of this moun∣taine read in the discourse be∣fore the be∣ginning of Leo.</NOTE> mount Amara; where he would also haue the Empe∣rours sonnes to be put, who cannot succeed in the Empire, nor haue any State at all, for which cause the Emperour ordinarily marrieth not.</P>

<HEAD>His forces both in reuenues and people.</HEAD>
<P>HE hath two kindes of reuenues, for one consisteth in the fruits of his possessions, which he causeth to be manured by his slaues, and oxen. These slaues multiplie continuallie, for they marrie among themselues and their sonnes remaine in the condition of their progenitors. An other great reuenue cōmeth of his tributes, which are brought vnto him, from all those that hold dominion vnder him. And of these, some giue horses, some ox∣en, some gold, some cotton, and others other thinges. It is thought he hath great treasure as well of cloaths and iewels, as of gold, and also that he hath treasuries and large magazins of the same riches, so that writing once to the king of Portugal, he offered to giue for the maintenance of war against the Infidels, an hundred thousand drams of gold, with infinite store of men and victuall. They say, that he putteth ordinarilie euerie yeere into the castel of Amara, the value of three millions of ducates. It is true, that before the dayes of King Alexander they layde not vp so much golde, because they knew not how to purifie it: but rather iewels and wedges of gold. Also his commings-in may be said to bee of three sorts: for some he raiseth as it were, out of his crowne-landes: another part he leuieth of the people, that pay him so much for an house, and the tenth of all those mines that are dig∣ged by others then by himselfe: and a third reuenue he draweth from his tri∣butarie princes and gouernours: and these giue him the entire reuenues of one of their cities, so as he choose not that citie wherein they make their re∣sidence. But though his wealth and reuenues be great, yet are his people of little worth, as well because he holdeth them in the estimation of slaues, by meanes whereof they want that generositie of minde, which maketh men ready to take vp armes, &amp; to be couragious in dāgers: as also it seemeth they haue euer their handes bound with that awefull reuerence which they beare towards their Prince, and the feare they haue of him: and further, in that they haue no armes of defence but bad headpeeces, halfe sculles, and coats of maile, carried thither by the Portugals. Hereunto may be added his want of fortresses: for neither hauing strong places whither to retire, nor armes to defend themselues; they and their townes remaine as a pray to the enemie; their offensiue armes being vnfeathered arrowes, and some darts. They haue a lent of fiftie daies continuance, which through the great ab∣stinence, wherein they passe all that time, doth so weaken and afflict them, that neither for those daies, nor many other following, they haue the strength to stirre abroad: whereupon the Moores attend this opportunitie, and assaile them with great aduantage. <HI>Francis Aluares</HI> writeth, that <HI>Prete Ianni</HI> can bring into the field, an hundred thousand men: neuerthelesse in time of neede it hath beene seene, that he could make nothing so many.

<HEAD>Princes confining vpon the Prete Ianni.</HEAD>
<P>THis Prince, as farre as we can certainly vnderstand, confi∣neth especially with three other mightie princes: one is the king of Borno; another the great Turke; and the third the king of Adel. The king of Buruo ruleth ouer that countrey which extendeth from Guangara towards the east, about fiue hundred miles, betweene the deserts of Seu, and Barca, being of an vn∣eeuen situation, bicause it is partly mountainous, and partly plaine. In the plaines there dwelleth a very ciuill people in populous and much frequen∣ted villages, by reason of the abundance of graine, as also there is some con∣course of merchants thither. On the mountaines, shepheardes of great and smal beasts do inhabite, and their chiefe sustenance is mill: They lead a brutish life, without religion, with their wiues and children in common: They vse no other proper names, but those which are taken from the quali∣tie or forme of mens persons: the lame, the squint eied, the long, the stutte∣ring. This king of Borno is most mightie in men, vpon whom he laieth no other imposition but the tenth of their fruits; their profession is to robbe and steale from their neighbours, and to make them slaues: in exchange of whom, they haue of the merchants of Barbarie, horses. He hath vnder him many kingdomes, and people, partly white, and partly blacke. He molesteth the Abassines exceedingly with theftes, leadeth away their cattell, robbeth their mines, &amp; maketh their men slaues. They fight on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-backe after the Gynnet fashion, they vse lances with two heads, &amp; darts &amp; arrowes: they as∣saile a countrey sometimes in one part, and otherwhiles in another, sud∣denly: but these may rather be termed theeues and robbers then right eni∣mies.</P>
<P>The Turke confineth with Abassia on the east; as likewise the king of Adel, who hemmeth it in betweene the east and the south. They disturbe the <HI>Prete</HI> exceedingly, restraining the limites of his Empire, and bringing his countrey into great miserie: For the Turkes besides the putting of a great part of Barnagasso, to sacke and spoile; (vpon which they entred the yeere of our Lord, 1558.) although they were driuen out againe, haue further ta∣ken all that from the <HI>Prete</HI> which he possessed on the sea coast: especiallie the portes and townes of Suaquen and Ercoco: In which two places, the mountaines lying betwixt Abassia and the red sea, doe open, and make a passage, for conueiance of victual, and trafficke, betweene the Abassins, and the Arabians: And it is not long, since the Lord <HI>Barnagasso</HI> was con∣strained to accord with the Turke, and to buie the peace of his countrie
<PB N="365" REF="219"/>
with the tribute of a thousand ounces of gold by the yeere. Also the King of <HI>Adel</HI> procureth hym no lesse molestation: This man confineth with the kingdome of Fatigar, and extendeth his dominion euen to the Red sea, where he hath Assum, Salir, Meth, Barbora, Pidar, and Zeila. At Barbora manie shippes of Aden, and Cambaia arriue with their marchandize for ex∣change; from whence they receiue much flesh, honie, wax, and victuals for Aden; and gold, Iuorie, and other thinges for Cambaia. A greater quantitie of victuall is carried from Zeila, because there is aboundance of waxe, and honie, with corne and diuers fruites, which are laden for Aden, and for Arabia, and beastes also, as namely sheepe, with tayles wayghing more then fiue and twentie poundes, with their heads and necks all blacke, but the rest of them is white: as also certaine other all white with tayles a fathome long, and writhen like a vine branche, hauing thropples vnder their throtes like bulles. There be also certaine kine with branched hornes like to wild hartes, being blacke in colour and sorne others red, with one onely horne vpon their foreheads of an handfull and an halfe long, turning backward. The chiefe city of this kingdome is Arar eight and thirtie leagues from Zeila towards the South east. This king being a Mahumetan by a perpetuall profession of making war against the christians of Abassia, who are the subiects of the <HI>Prete,</HI> hath obteined of those Barbarians the surname of Holy: He stayeth his óportunitie while the Abassins be weakened, and brought downe with that long and hard fast of fiftie daies, when they can scarcely go about their domesticall affaires; and then he entreth into the countrey, sacketh the townes, leadeth the people away into seruitude, and doth a thousand iniu∣ries vnto them. The Abassin slaues are of great valew out of their owne countrey: whereupon the bordering, and other Princes both farre and neere esteeme them much, and many of them by meanes of their indu∣strie in seruice, of slaues haue become captaines and great Commanders, in Arabia, Cambaia, Bengala, and Sumatra: Bicause the Mahumetan prin∣ces of the east, being all tirants ouer kingdomes vsurped from the Gentiles, for securitie of their state, put no trust in their owne subiects: but arme themselues with a multitude of strange slaues, to whom they commit their persons, and the gouernment of their kingdome. And among all other slaues the Abassines beare away the bell, aswell for fidelitie, as for sound and good complexion. And bicause the king of Adel, with the multitude of these Abassin slaues, which he taketh in the townes and territories of <HI>Prete Ianni,</HI> filleth all Egypt, and Arabia (in exchange of whom he hath armour, munition, and soldiers, both from the Turke, and the Arabian Princes) in the yeere of our Lord 1550. <HI>Claudius</HI> king of Abassia, being after this sort sorely oppressed by <HI>Gradaamed</HI> king of Adel, who now for the space of fowerteene yeeres had with continuall incursions greeuously molested, and disturbed him, enforcing him to leaue his confines, and to retire into the hart of his empire, demaunded aide of <HI>Stephano Gama,</HI> the Indian Viceroy of <HI>Iohn</HI> the third king of Portugale, who was then with a good

fleete vpon The red sea. Whereupon he sent him fower hundred Portu∣gals, with a good quantitie of armes, and small shot, vnder the gouernment of <HI>Christopher da Gama</HI> his brother. With these men by the benefit of shot, he ouerthrew the enimie in two battailes; but in the third, the king of Adel hauing receiued a thousand Turkish harquebuziers from the gouernour of Zebit, with ten peeces of artillerie, the Abassins were put to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and dis∣comfited, and their captaine taken prisoner, and put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> death. But the king of Adel afterwards sending backe the said Turkes, he and his people were sodainly, assailed, neere the riuer of Zeila, and mount Saual, by king <HI>Claudi∣us</HI> with threescore thousand foote, and fiue hundred Abassin horse, togi∣ther with those Portugales, who remained of the former ouerthrow, one of whom wounded <HI>Gradamed</HI> dangerously. But in the moneth of March, the yeere of our Lord 1559. king <HI>Claudius</HI> being set vpon againe by the <HI>Malacai</HI> Mores, he was slaine in the battaile: and the enimie-king acknow∣ledging so great a victorie from the handes of God, triumphed vpon an asse.</P>
<P><HI>Adamas</HI> brother vnto king <HI>Claudius</HI> succeeded him, against whom (for he was halfe a Mahumetan) the best part of the Abassine nobilitie rebelled, and he was defeated by the Barnagasso in the yeere 1562. who hauing thus for a while disturbed the affaires of Ethiopia, it seemed that they were at length asswaged, &amp; reestablished vnder <HI>Alexander,</HI> by the aide of the Por∣tugals, who haue carried thither armes as well of offence, as defence, and stirred vp the mindes and courages of the Abassines, by their example, to warre; For all those that remained of the discomfiture giuen to <HI>Christopher Gama,</HI> and diuers others which came thither afterwards, and do daily there arriue and staie, do marrie wiues, and haue children; and <HI>Alexander</HI> per∣mitted them to elect a iudge, who might execute iustice among them: So that they haue, and do daily bring into Abassia, the manner of warfare in Europe, with our vse of armes, and the manner of fortifying passages and places of importance. Afterwards certaine Florentines went into those countries, partly vpon pleasure, and partly for affaires of merchandize. For <HI>Francesco di Medici</HI> great Duke of Florence, had some commerce with the Abassines. The <HI>Prete</HI> therefore giues entertainment, and maketh much of the Frankes, (for so do they call the people of Europe) and hardly giueth them license to depart out of his kingdome. Besides these the <HI>Prete Ianni</HI> hath diuers other enimies, amongst whom is the king of Dancali, to whom the towne and port of Vela vpon the red sea pertaineth; he confineth with Balgada. The Moores also vexe him greatly, which inhabite the prouince, called Dobas, deuided into fowerteene Signiories; for though they be with∣in the confines of <HI>Prete Ianni</HI> his empire, yet notwithstanding for the most part they rebell from him: they haue a lawe, that none of them may marrie, before he first giue testimoniall that he hath slaine twelue Christians.</P>

<P>COncerning the state of this mightie Emperour, and of his neighbour of Mohenemugi, and of the limits of both their dominions, as like∣wise of the Amazones and Giacchi the chiefe strength of their mili∣tarie forces, and other memorable matters; to auoide tedious repetitions, I referre the reader to the discourse going before the booke: saue onely that I will heere annexe a briefe testimony out of Osorius lib 4 de reb gest.

<P>But (saith he) in this part of Ethiopia lying beyond the cape of good hope which is bounded by the south Ocean, there is a most ample king∣dome called Benomotapa, whereunto before such time as the Portugals discouered those parts, all the kinges vpon that coast were most obedientlie subiect. It aboundeth with gold beyond all credite: which is taken euen out<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in gold.</NOTE> of their riuers and lakes. Yea many kings there are which pay yeerely tri∣bute of gold vnto this king of Benomotapa. The people worship no Idols, but acknowledge one God the creatour of heauen and earth. In habite and apparell they are not much vnlike to other Ethiopians. They worship their king with woonderfull superstition.

The one of his darts betokeneth, that he will be a seuere punisher of male∣factors; &amp; the other, that he will by valour &amp; force of armes resist all forren inuasions. The sonnes of his tributarie kings are trained vp in his court;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> course.</NOTE> both to the end that by this education they may learne loialtie and loue to∣wards him their soueraigne, and also that they may remaine as pledges to keepe their fathers in awe and due obedience.

<HEAD>The Xeriffo, commonly called The king of Maroco <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and Fez.</HEAD>
<P>AMong all the princes of Africa, I suppose that there is not anie one, who in richnes of state, or greatnes of power, may be prefer∣red before the Xeriffo: In that his dominion, which comprehen∣deth all that part of Mauritania, called by the Romaines Tingi∣tana, extendeth it selfe north &amp; south from Capo Boiador, euen to Tanger, and east and west from the Atlanticke Ocean, as farre as the riuer Muluia, and somewhat further also, in which space is comprehended the fairest, fruitfullest, best inhabited, and most ciuill part of all Africk, and among other the states, the most famous kingdomes of Maroco and Fez. With the particular description whereof, and of all the prouinces, cities, townes, riuers, mountaines, &amp;c. therein contained, the Reader may satisfie himselfe to the full in the second and third bookes of the historie of <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> before set downe.</P>
<P>These kingdomes besides their natural fertilitie, are very traffickable; for though the king of Fez hath no hauen of importance vpon the Mediterra∣nean sea, neuerthelesse the English, French, and other nations traffick much to his ports vpon the Ocean, especially to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Described by Leo in his fifth booke vnder the name of Lha∣rais.</NOTE> Larache, Santa Cruz, Cabo de Guer, and in other places perteining partly to the kingdome of Fez, and partly to Maroco; and they bring thither copper, and brasse, with armes and diuers commodities of Europe, for which among other things they returne sugar.</P>
<P>But because these kingdomes of Maroco and Fez, and diuers other Sig∣niories, and Principalities, at first separate and deuided, were vnited not long sithence vnder one Prince, who is called <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Miramo∣nin.</NOTE> the Xeriffo, it will not be much from our purpose (because among the accidents of our times, I think there is not any one, more notable or wonderfull then this) to set downe here how the matter passed.</P>
<P>About the yeere of our Lord 1508 a certaine Alchaide borne in Tigu∣medet<NOTE PLACE="marg">The maner how the Xeriffos aspired to the kingdomes of Maroco, Sus, and Fez.</NOTE> a towne of Dara, whose name was <HI>Mahumet Benametto,</HI> and who caused himselfe to be called <HI>Xeriffo,</HI> being a subtile man, and of a minde no lesse ambitious, then learned in those sciences, whereunto the Mahumetans are most addicted, began to grow famous in the townes of Numidia. This man vaunting himselfe to be descended of <HI>Mahumets</HI> progenie, was posses∣sed with an imagination (trusting in the deuision of the States of Affricke, wherein then the Portugals bore great sway) of taking into his owne hands all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or the king∣domes of Maro∣co, and Fez.</NOTE> Mauritania Tingitana. For performance of this, he first sent his three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>Abdel, Abnet,</HI> and <HI>Mahumet,</HI> in pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, there to visit &amp; do reuerence to the sepulchre of their Seductor <HI>Mahumet.</HI> The yoong men performed this voyage with so great fame and reputation of sanctitie and religion (if these words may be vsed, in declaring of such an

impietie) that in their returne, the people came out to meete them, kissed their garments, and reuerenced them as saints. They fayning themselues to be rauished into deepe contemplation, went vp and downe the streetes sigh∣ing, and crying out in words interrupted with lamentation &amp; yerning: Alá, Alá; and they liued of nothing but almes. Their father hauing taken them home with great mirth and ioy: but yet not minding to suffer this sudden applause &amp; credit, which they had obtayned by such a pilgrimage, to freeze and wax cold; he sent two of them which were <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Abnet.</NOTE> <HI>Amet</HI> and <HI>Mahumet</HI> to Fez; where being courteously receiued by the king, one of them became a Rea∣der in the Amodoraccia, a most famous colledge of that citie, and the the yoongest was made tutor to the same kings yoong sonnes. These two seeing themselues so entirely beloued of the king, and in so great fauour with the people, being aduised by their father, and taking occasion vpon the damage which the Arabians &amp; Moores did to those of their owne law &amp; sect, vnder the ensignes of the Portugals, in whose paie they serued. They demaunded leaue of the king to display a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against the Christians, put∣ting him in hope, (as indeed it fell out) that they would easily draw those Moores vnto him, who were followers of the crowne of Portugall, and by this meanes secure the prouinces of Sus, Hea, Ducala, Maroco, with others molested, &amp; euilly entreated by the Portugals. This request was con∣tradicted by <HI>Mullei Nazer,</HI> brother to the king: <Q>for (said he) if these men, vnder pretence of holines, and defence of their law, shall haue some prospe∣rous proceedings with armes in hand, it will not afterwards be in thy power (O king) to bridle or bring them downe: for armes make men couragious, &amp; by victories they prooue insolent, &amp; the rout of ambitious people are al∣waies desirous of innouation.</Q> But the king who had a great opinion of their sanctitie, making small account of the reasons his brother alleaged vnto him, gaue them a banner, and drumslade, and twentie horse to accompanie them, with letters of recommendation to the Arabians, the princes, and the cities of Barbarie. With these beginnings many people running headlong after their fame, they ouercame Ducala, and the countrey of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Azaphi.</NOTE> Saphia, and went forward euen as farre as Cabo de Guer, (which places then were sub∣iect to the Portugals) and finding themselues strong, both in retinue and credite, they demanded of the people (who at that time liued for the most part freely, and came in to none, but such as they liked of themselues) that seeing they now tooke vp armes, for the Mahumetane law against the Chri∣stians, they should aide them with their tenthes due vnto God: the which were presently yeelded vnto them by the people of Dara, and so they seazed by little and little vpon Tarodant (where their father was made gouernour) and likewise of Sus, Hea, Ducala, and other places adioining. They first planted themselues in Tednest, and then in Tesarote, and in a conflict <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Lopes Barriga,</HI> a famous captaine amongst the Portugals: but so they lost their owne elder brother therein. And afterwards by faire words en∣tring into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Maroco, they poisoned the king, and in his stead
<PB N="370" REF="222"/>
made <HI>Amet Xeriffo</HI> to be proclaimed king of Maroco. In the meane while the Arabians of Ducala, &amp; Xarquia came to hand blowes with those of Gar∣bia, each partie holding themselues in the <HI>Xeriffoes</HI> fauour; but the <HI>Xeriffos</HI> perceiuing the skirmish to grow hot, and that many both of the one and of the other party went to wrack, turned their armes against them both, and en∣riched themselues with their spoiles. In former times they vsed to send vn∣to the king of Fez the fift of all those booties which they got; but after this victory, making no reckoning of their said custom, they presented him only with six horses, and six camels, &amp; those but silly ones: wherat being mooued, he sent to demand of them the fift part of their spoiles, and the tribute that the king of Maroco paied him, threatning otherwise warre vpon them. But in the meane while, this man dying, <HI>Amet</HI> his sonne, who was scholler to the yoonger <HI>Xeriffo,</HI> was not onely content, but further confirmed <HI>Amet</HI> in the Signiorie of Maroco, so that in some small matter he would acknowledge the kings of Fez for soueraigne Princes ouer that citie. But on the other side the <HI>Xeriffi,</HI> whose reputation and power daily encreased, when the time of paying tribute came, sent to certifie this yoong king, that being lawfull successors to <HI>Mahumet,</HI> they were not bound to paie tribute to any, and that they had more right to Affrica then he: so that if he would haue them his friends, so it were; otherwise if he ment to diuert them from this their warre against the Christians, they should not want courage nor power to defend themselues. Wherewith the Fessan king being offended, proclai∣med warre against them, and went himselfe in person to the siege of Maro∣co: but at the very first he was driuen to dislodge: and afterwards returning with eighteene thousand horse, amongst whom were two thousand harque∣buziers, or bowmen, he was vanquished by the <HI>Xeriffi,</HI> who had no more but seuen thousand horse, and twelue hundred harquebuziers which were placed on the way at the passage of a riuer. By meanes of this victorie the <HI>Xeriffi</HI> shooke off the tribute of that countrie, and passing ouer Atlas, they tooke Tafilete, an important citie: and partly by faire meanes, partly by force, they brought diuérs people of Numidia to their obedience, as also those of the mountaines. In the yeere of our Lord 1536. the yoonger <HI>Xeriffo</HI> who was now called king of Sus, hauing gathered togither a mightie armie, and much artillerie, taken in part from the king of Fez, and partly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Artillerie cast by French Re∣negados.</NOTE> cast by the French Renegados, he went to the enterprise of Cabo de Guer, a very important fortification, held then by the Portugals, which was built and fortified sirst at the charge of <HI>Lopes Sequeira:</HI> and afterward, knowing their opportunitie from the king <HI>Don Emanuel,</HI> there was fought on both sides a most terrible battell.

seeing that his expences farre exceeded the reuenues which came in, of his owne accord gaue ouer Safia, Azamor, Arzilla, and Alcazar, holds which he had on the coast of Mauritania.</P>
<P>This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was an occasion of grieuous discord betwixt the Bro∣thers: the issue whereof was, that the younger hauing in two battels subdued the elder (whereof the second was in the yeere of our Lord 1554) and taken him prisoner, he banished him to Tafilet: and afterwards turning his armes against the king of Fez, after hauing taken him once prisoner, and then re∣leasing him, he yet the second time (because he brake promise) got him into his handes againe, depriued him of his estate, and in the end caused both him and his sonnes to be slaine; and by meanes of his owne sonnes he also tooke Tremizen.</P>
<P>In the meane while <HI>Sal Araes</HI> viceroy of Algier fearing the Xeriffos prosperous successe, gathered together a great army, with which he first re∣couered Tremizen, &amp; afterwards defeating the Xeriffo, conquered Fez, and gaue the gouernment thereof to <HI>Buasson</HI> Prince of Veles: but this man ioy∣ning battaile with the Xeriffo, lost at one instant both his citie and king∣dome. In the ende. <HI>Mahumet</HI> going to Tarodant was vpon the way slaine in his pauilion, by the treason of some Turkes, suborned thereunto by the viceroy of <HI>Algier,</HI> of whom one <HI>Assen</HI> was the chiefe: who together with his companions went into Tarodant, and there made hauock of the kinges treasures: But in their returne home, they were all, but fiue, slaine by the peo∣ple, in the yeere 1559: and <HI>Mullei Abdala</HI> the <HI>Xeriffos</HI> sonne, was proclai∣med and saluted king.</P>
<P>Let thus much suffice to haue bin spoken of the <HI>Xeriffo:</HI> whose procee∣dinges appeare much like to those of <HI>Ismael</HI> the sophie of Persia. Both of them procured followers by bloud and the cloake of religion: both of them subdued in short time many countries: both of them grew great by the ruine of their neighbours both of them receiued greeuous checkes by the Turkes, and lost a part of their states: for <HI>Selym</HI> tooke from <HI>Ismael,</HI> Cacamit and diuers other cities of Diarbena: And the viceroy of Algier did driue the <HI>Xeriffo</HI> out of Tremizen, and his other quarters: And euen as <HI>Selim</HI> won Tauris, the head citie of Persia, and afterwardes gaue it ouer: so <HI>Sal Araes</HI> tooke Fez the head citie of Mauritania, and then after abandoned the same.</P>

<HEAD>The Xeriffo his reuenues, or commings in.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Xeriffo</HI> is absolute Lord of all his subiects goods, yea and of their persons also. For though he charge them with neuer so burdensome tributes, and impositions; yet dare they not so much as open their mouthes: He receiueth from his tributarie vassals, the tenthes, and first fruits of their corne and cattell. True it is, that for the first fruits he taketh no more but one for twentie, and the whole being aboue twentie, he demandeth no
<PB N="372" REF="223"/>
more then two, though it amount to an hundred. For euery dayes tilth of grounde he hath a ducate and a quarter, and so much likewise for euerie house; as also, he hath after the same rate of euerie person aboue fifteene yeers old, male, or female; and when need requireth, a greater summe: and to the end that the people may the more cheerefullie pay that which is impo∣sed vpon them, he alwaies demaundeth halfe as much more as he is to re∣ceiue. Most true it is, that on the mountaines there inhabite certaine fierce and vatamed people, who by reason of the steep, craggie, and inexpugnable situation of their countrie cannot be forced to tributes; that which is gotten of them, is the tenth of their corne and fruits, onely that they may be per∣mitted to haue recourse into the plaines. Besides these reuenues, the king hath the towles and customes of Fez, and of other cities: For at the entring of their goods, the naturall citizen payeth two in the hundred, and the stranger ten.</P>
<P>He hath further, the reuenues of milles, and many other thinges, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caruuen the principall Mahumetan temple in Fez, being a mile and an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about.

The moschea of Ca∣ruuen had fourescore thousand ducates of rent: the colledges and hospitals of Fez had also many thousands. Al which the king hath at this present. And further he is heire to all the Alcaydes, and them that haue pension of him, and at their deaths he possesseth their horses, armour, garments, and al their goodes. Howbeit if the deceased leaue any sonnes apt for the seruice of the warres, he granteth them their fathers prouision; but if they be but young, he bringeth vp the male children to yeeres of seruice, and the daughters, till they be married. And therefore, that he may haue some interest in the goods of rich men, he bestoweth vpon them some gouernment, or charge, with prouision. Wherefore for feare of confiscation after death, euery one coueteth to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his wealth, or to remoue far from the court, and the kings sight. For which cause the citie of Fez commeth far short of hir ancient glo∣rie.

<HEAD>His Forces.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Xeriffo</HI> hath not any Fortresses of great importance, but only vpon the sea-coast, as Cabo de Guer, Larache, and Tetuan: for as the Turks and Persians do, so he placeth the strength of his state in armed men: but especially in horse. And for this cause he standeth not much vpon his ar∣tillerie; although hee hath very great store (which his predecessors tooke from the Portugals and others) in Fez, Maroco, Tarodant, and in the fore∣saide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; causing also more to bee cast, when neede requireth; for he
<PB N="373" REF="223"/>
wanteth not masters of Europe in this Science. He hath an house of muni∣tion in Maroco, where they make ordinarily six and fortie quintals of pow∣der euery moneth; as likewise also caliuers and steele-bowes. In the yeere of our Lord 1569. a fire tooke hold on these houses with such furie, that a great part of the citie was destroied therewith. But for the <HI>Xeriffoes</HI> forces, they are of two sorts: the first is of two thousand seuen hundred horse, and two thousand harquibuziers, which he hath partly in Fez, but most in Ma∣roco (where he is resident) being as it were of his daily guard. The second is of a roiall squadron of sixe thousand gentlemen, being all of noble paren∣tage, and of great account. These men are mounted vpon excellent horses, with furniture and armes, for varietie of colour most beautifull, and for ri∣ches of ornament beyonde measure estimable: for euery thing about them shineth with gold, siluer, pearle, iewels, and whatsoeuer else may please the eie, or satisfie the curiositie of beholders. These men, besides prouision of corne, oile, butter, and flesh, for themselues, their wiues, children, and ser∣uants, receiue further in wages, from seuentie to an hundred ounces of sil∣uer a man. The third sort of forces which he hath, consisteth of his * Tima∣riotti:<NOTE PLACE="marg">These are a mi∣litarie order, like vnto them which hold land <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vs vnder the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of knights seruice.</NOTE> for the <HI>Xeriffo</HI> granteth to all his sons, and brothers, and other persons of account or authoritie among the people of Africke, or to the princes of the Arabians, the benefite of great Lordships &amp; tenures for sustentation of his Cauallarie: and the Alchaides themselues till the fields, and afterwardes reape rice, oile, barly, butter, sheepe, hens, and monie, and distribute the same monethly to the souldiers; according to the seuerall qualitie of their persons. They also giue them cloth, linnen, and silke to apparell themselues, armes of offence, and defence, and horses, with which they serue in the warres, and if they die or be killed, they allow them other. A thing which was also vsed in Rome, towards them that serued on publike horses. Euerie one of these leaders contendeth to bring his people into the fielde well or∣dred, for armes, apparell, and horses: besides this, they haue betweene fower and twentie and thirtie ounces of siluer wages euery yeere. His fourth mili∣tarie forces, are the Arabians, who liue continually in their Auari, (for so they call their habitations, each one of them consisting of an hundred, or two hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) gouerned by diuers Alchaides, to the end they may be readie in time of need. These serue on horse-backe, but they are rather to be accounted theeues, then true soldiers. His fift kinde of forces milita∣rie, are somewhat like vnto the trained soldiers of Christian princes; and among these, the inhabitants of cities and villages of the kingdome, and of the mountaines are enrolled. It is true, that the king makes but little account of them, &amp; very seldome puts armes into their hands, for feare of insurrecti∣ons and rebellions, except in the warres against the Christians, for then he cannot conueniently forbid them: For it being written in their law, that if à Moore kil a Christian, or is slaine by him, he goeth directly into Paradise, (a diabolicall inuention) men, women, and those of euery age and degree, run to the warres hand ouer head, that at least they may there be slaine; and
<PB N="274" REF="224" MS="y"/>
by this meanes (according to their foolish opinion) gaine heauen. No lesse zeale, to our confusion, may we perceiue in the Turks especially for de∣fence of their sect: for one would thinke they went to a marriage, and not to the warre, scarcely being able with patience to attend their prefixed time of going thither. They repute them holy and happie, that die with armes in hand against their enimies; as on the contrarie, those men vnhappie, and of little woorth, that die at home, amidst the lamentation of children, and outcries of women.</P>
<P>By the things aboue set downe, we may easily comprehend, what num∣bers of men the <HI>Xeriffo</HI> can bring into the field: but yet we may learne bet∣ter by experience. For <HI>Mullei Abdala</HI> in the yeere 1562. besieged Mazagan with two hundred thousand men, choaking the ditch with a mountaine of earth, and beating downe the walles thereof with his Artillerie: but for all this, he was enforced by the valour of the Portugals, and the damage which he receiued by their mines, to giue ouer his siege. Besides, this Prince can not continue a great war, aboue two, or three moneths: and the reason here∣of is, because his forces liuing on that prouision which he hath daylie com∣ming in, as well for sustenance as for aparrell, and not being able to haue all this conducted thither, where the war requireth, it followeth of necessitie, that in short time they must needs returne home for their maintenance of life: and further it is an euident thing, that no man can protract a war at length, except he be rich in treasure. <HI>Molucco</HI> who ouerthrew <HI>Sebastian</HI> king of Portugal, had in pay vnder his ensignes fortie thousand horse, and eight thousand foote besides Arabians and aduenturers: But it is thought, he could haue brought into the field, seuentie thousand horse, and more foot then he did.</P>

<P>BEsides Oran, Mersalquibir, Melilla and Pennon which the king of Spaine possesseth within the streights; as likewise, çeuta, Tanger, and Arzil, which by the title of Portugal he holdeth very neere the streights of Gibraltar; and Mazagan in like sort without the streights mouth, twentie miles to the southward of Arzil: he hath along the coast of Affrick, from Cape de Guer, to that of Guardafu, two sorts of states: for some are immedi∣diately vnder him; and others are as it were his adherents. The Ilands of Ma∣dera, Puerto Santo, the Canaries, the Isles of Arguin, of Cabo Verde, the isle Del Principe, with that of Sant Thomas, and others neere adioining, are immediately vnder his dominion. These islands are maintained with their owne victuall, and prouision, and yet they haue also some out of Eu∣rope, as in like manner they send some thither: especially sugars and fruits,
<PB N="375" REF="224"/>
wherewith the isle of Madera woonderfully aboundeth, as also with wine. And the iland of Sant Thomas likewise hath great abundance of sugars. These States haue no incumbrance, but by the English and French men of warre, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mine author heere much mistaketh the matter.</NOTE> which for all that go not beyond Cape Verde. At the ilands of Ar∣guin, and at Sant George de la Mina, the Portugals haue planted factories in forme of fortresses, by meanes of which, they trade with the bordering people of Guinie and Libya, and get into their hands the gold of Mandin∣ga, and other places neere about. Among the adherent Princes, the richest and most honorable, is the king of Congo, in that his kingdome is one of the most flourishing, and plentifull countries in all Ethiopia. The Por∣tugals haue there two Colonies, one in the citie of S. Saluador, and an other in the island Loanda. They haue diuers rich commodities from this king∣dome, but the most important is euery yeere about 5000. slaues, which they transport from thence, and sell them at good round prizes in all the isles and maine lands of the west Indies: and for the head of euerie slaue so taken vp, there is a good taxe paid to the crowne of Portugall. From this kingdome one might easily go to the countrie of <HI>Prete Ianni,</HI> for it is not thought to be very farre off: and it doth so abound with Elephants, victuall, and all other necessarie things, as would bring singular ease and commodity to such an enterprise. Vpon the kingdome of Congo confineth Angola, with whose prince of late yeeres <HI>Paulo Dias</HI> a Portugall captaine made war: And the principall occasion of this warre are certaine mines of siluer, in the mountaines of Cabambe, no whit inferior to those of Potossi; but by so much are they better, as fine siluer goeth beyond that which is base, and course. And out of doubt, if the Portugals had esteemed so well of things neere at hand, as they did of those farther off and remote, and had thither bent their forces wherewith they passed Capo de buena esperança, and went to India, Malaca, and the Malucoes; they had more easily, and with lesse charge found greater wealth: for there are no countries in the world richer in gold and siluer, then the kingdomes of Mandinga, Ethiopia, Congo, Angola, Butua, Toroa, Maticuo, Boro, Quiticui, Monomotapa, Cafati, and Mohenemugi. But humane auarice esteemeth more of an other mans, then his owne, and things remote appeere greater then those neere at hand. Betweene Cabo de buena esperança, and Cape Guardafu, the Portugals haue the fortresses of Sena, Cephala, and Mozambique. And by these they continue masters of the trade with the bordering nations, all which abound in gold and iuorie. By these fortresses they haue speciall commoditie, for their nauigation to the Indies; bicause their fleetes sometimes winter, and otherwhiles victuall, and refresh themselues there. In these parts the king of Melinde is their greatest friend, and those of Quiloa, and other neigh∣bour-islands, are their tributaries. The Portugals want nothing but men. For besides other islands, which they leaue in a manner abandoned, there is that of Saint Laurence, one of the greatest in all the world (being a thou∣sand two hundred miles long, and fower hundred and fower-score broad)
<PB N="376" REF="225"/>
the which, though it be not well tilled, yet for the goodnes of the soile it is apt and fit to be manured, nature hauing distinguished it with riuers, har∣bours, &amp; most commodious baies. These States belonging to the crowne of Portugall, feare no other but such sea-forces, as may be brought thither by the Turkes. But the daily going to and fro of the Portugall fleetes, which coast along vp and downe those seas, altogither secureth them.

<HEAD>A summarie discourse of the manifold Religions professed in Africa: and first of the Gentiles.</HEAD>
<P>AFrica containeth fower sorts of people diffe∣rent in religion: that is to say, Gentiles, Iewes, Mahumetans, and Christians. The Gentiles extend themselues along the shoare of the Ocean, in a manner from Cabo Blanco, or the white Cape, euen to the northren borders of Congo; as likewise, from the southerly bounds of the same kingdome, euen to Capo de buena Esperança; &amp; from thence, to that De los Cor∣rientes: and within the land they spred out, from the Ethiopick Ocean, euen vnto Nilus, and beyond Nilus also from the Ethiopick, to the Arabian sea. These Gentiles are of diuers sorts, for some of them haue no light of God, or religion, neither they are gouerned by any rule or law. Wherupon the Arabians call them Cafri, that is to say, lawlesse, or without law. They haue but fewe habitations, and they liue for the most part in caues of mountaines, or in woods, wherein they finde some harbour from winde and raine. The ciuilest among them, who haue some vnder∣standing and light of diuinitie and religion, obey the Monomotapa, whose dominion extendeth with a great circuite, from the confines of Matama, to the riuer Cuama: but the noblest part thereof is comprehended betweene the mightie riuer of Magnice or Spirito Sancto, and that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for the space of sixe hundred leagues. They haue no idols, and beleeue in one only God, called by them Mozimo. Little differing from these we may esteeme the subiects of Mohenemugi. But among all the Cafri, the people called Agag or Giacchi, are reputed most brutish, inhabiting in woods and dens, and being deuourers of mans flesh. They dwell vpon the left banke of Nilus, betweene the first and second lake. The Anzichi also haue a sham∣bles of mans flesh, as we haue of the flesh of oxen. They eate their enimies whom they take in war; they sell their slaues to butchers, if they can light on no greater prise: and they inhabit from the riuer Zaire, euen to the deserts of Nubia. Some others of them are rather addicted to witchcraft, then to ido∣latrie: considering that in a man, the feare of a superior power is so naturall, that though he adore nothing vnder the name and title of a God, yet doth he reuerence and feare some superioritie, although he know not what it is. Such are the Biafresi, and their neighbours, all of them being addicted in such sort to witchcraft, as that they vaunt, that by force of enchantment, they can not onely charme, and make men die, much more molest and
<PB N="378" REF="226"/>
bring them to hard point: but further, raise windes and raine, and make the skie to thunder and lighten, and that they can destroy all herbes and plants, and make the flockes and heards of cattell to fall downe dead. Whereupon they reuerence more the diuell then any thing else: sacrificing vnto him of their beasts and fruits of the earth, yea their owne bloud also, and their chil∣dren. Such are likewise the priests of Angola, whom they call Ganghe. These make profession that they haue in their hands dearth and abundance; faire weather and foule; life and death. For which cause it can not be ex∣pressed, in what veneration they are held among these Barbarians. In the yeere 1587. a Portugall captaine being in a part of Angola with his souldi∣ers, a Ganga was requested by the people, to refresh the fields, which were drie and withered, with some quantitie of water. He needed no great intrea∣tie, but going forth with diuers little bels, in presence of the Portugals, he spent an halfe hower in fetching suudry gambols &amp; skips, &amp; vttering diuers superstitious murmurings: and behold, a cloud arose in the aire, with light∣ning and thunder. The Portugals grew amazed; but all the Barbarians with great ioy admired and extolled vnto heauen, their Ganga, who now gaue out intolerable brags, not knowing what hung ouer his head: For the windes outragiously blowing, the skie thundring after a dreadfull man∣ner, in stead of the raine by him promised, there fell a thunderbolt, which like a sword cut his head cleane from his shoulders. Some other idolaters not looking much aloft, worship earthly things: such were the people of Congo before their conuersion, and are at this day those that haue not yet receiued the Gospell. For these men worship certaine dragons with wings, and they foolishly nourish them in their houses, with the delicatest meates that they haue. They worship also serpents of horrible shape, goats, tygers, and other creatures, and the more they feare and reuerence them, by how much the more deformed and monstrous they are. Amongst the number of their gods also, they reckon bats, owles, owlets, trees, and herbes, with their figures in wood and stone: and they do not onely worship these beasts li∣uing, but euen their versy kins when they are dead, being filled with straw, or some other matter: and the manner of their idolatrie is, to bow downe be∣fore the foresaid things, to cast themselues groueling vpon the earth, to co∣uer their faces with dust, and to offer vnto them of their best substance. Some lifting vp their mindes a little higher, worship starres, such be the people of Guinie, and their neighbours, who are enclined to the worship of the sunne, the greatest part of them: and they hold opinion, that the soules of those dead that liued well, mount vp into heauen, and there dwell perpetual∣ly neere vnto the sunne. Neither want there amongst these, certaine others so superstitious, as they worship for God the first thing they meete with∣all, comming out of their houses. They also hold their kings in the account &amp; estimation of Gods, whom they suppose to be descended from heauen, &amp; their kings, to maintaine themselues in such high reputation, are serued with woonderfull ceremonies, neither will they be seene but very seldome.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Iewes.</HEAD>
<P>THe Iewes who haue bene dispersed by god throughout the whole world, to confirme vs in the holie faith, entered into Ethiopia in the Queene of <HI>Sabas</HI> daies, in companie of a son that <HI>Salomon</HI> had by her, to the number (as the Abassins affirme) of twelue thousand, and there multi∣plied their generation exceedingly. In that they not onely filled Abassia, but spred themselues likewiseall ouer the neighbour prouinces. So that at this day also the Abassins affirme, that vpon Nilus towards the west, there inha∣ibteth a most populous nation of the Iewish stock, vnder a mightie K. And some of our moderne Cosmographers set downe a prouince in those quar∣ters, which they call The land of the Hebrewes, placed as it were vnder the equinoctiall, in certaine vnknowne mountaines, betweene the confines of Abassia, and Congo. And likewise on the north part of the kingdome of Goiame, and the southerly quarter of the kingdome of Gorham, there are certaine mountaines, peopled with Iewes, who there maintaine themselues free, and absolute, through the inaccessiable situations of the same. For in truth by this means, the inhabitants of the mountaines (speaking generally) are the most ancient, and freest people: in that the strong situation of their natiue soile secureth them, from the incursions of forraine nations, and the violence of their neighbours. Such are the Scottes in Britaine, and the Bis∣kaines in Spaine. But to return againe to our purpose: the Anzichi, who ex∣tend from the bankes of the riuer Zaire, euen to the confines of Nubia, vse circumcision, as also diuers other bordering people do, a thing that must necessarilie haue been brought in by the Iewes, &amp; yet remayning stil in vse, after the annihilation of the Mosaicall law amongst them. Some also think, that the people called Cafri or Cafates at this day, who are gentiles, draw their originall from the Iewes, but being enuironed on euery side by Idola∣ters, they haue by little and little swarued from the law of Moses: and so are become, as it were, insensibly, Idolaters. On the other side, the Iewes being woonderfully increased in Spaine, passed one after an other into Affricke and Mauritania, and dispersed themselues euen to the confines of Numi∣dia, especiallie by meanes of traffick, and the profession of goldsmithes, the which being vtterly forbidden the Mahumetans, is altogether practised amongst them by the Iewes, as are likewise diuers other mechanicall crafts, but principallie that of black smithes. A thing which notablie appeareth in mount Sefsaua in the kingdome of Maroco, and in mount Anteta. It is said that Eitdeuet, a towne in the kingdome of Maroco, was inhabited by the Iewes, of the stock (as they affirme) of <HI>Dauid,</HI> who notwithstanding by little and little are growne Mahumetans. The Iewes encreased afterwards in Af∣frick, when first <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> king of Spaine called The catholicke, and after him <HI>Emanuell</HI> king of Portugal, put them forth of their dominions: For then many went ouer into the kingdomes of Fez and Maroco, and brought in

thither the artes and professions of Europe vnknowne before to those Bar∣barians. In Bedis, Teza, Elmedina, Tefsa, and in Segelmesse euery placeis full of them. They passe also by way of traffick euen to Tombuto, although <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> writeth how that king was so greatly their enemie, that he confisca∣ted the goods of those that traded with them. It importeth me not to speake of Egypt, because it hath euer beene, as well by reason of the neernes of Pa∣lestina, as for the commodity of traffick, whereunto they are much enclined, as it were, their second countrie. Here in great number, and in a manner in all the cities and townes thereof, they exercise mechanicall arts, and vse traffick and merchandize, as also take vpon them the receit of taxes and cu∣stomes: but aboue all other places, in Alexandria and Cairo, where they a∣mount to the number of fiue and twentie thousand, and the ciuiller sort among them do vsually speake the Castilian toung.</P>

Being growne to mans estate, the Scenite Arabians, ac∣customed to rob, and runne all ouer the countrie, tooke him prisoner, and sold him to a Persian merchant, who discerning him to be apt, and subtile about busines, affected and held him in such account, that after his death his mistresse remaining a widow, scorned not to take him for her husband. Be∣ing therefore inriched by this meanes, with goods and credit, he raised vp his minde to greater matters. The times then answered very fitly for one that woulde disturbe or worke any innouation. For the Arabians vpon some euill entreatie were malecontented with the Emperour <HI>Heraclius.</HI> The here∣sies of <HI>Arrius</HI> and <HI>Nestorius,</HI> had in a miserable sort shaken and annoied the church of God. The Iewes, though they wanted power, yet amounted they to a great number. The Saracens preuailed mightily, both in number and force. And the Romaine Empire was full of slaues. <HI>Mahumet</HI> there∣fore taking hold on this opportunitie, framed a law, wherein all of them should haue some part, or prerogatiue. In this two Apostata Iewes, and two
<PB N="381" REF="227"/>
heretikes, assisted him: of which, one was <HI>Iohn,</HI> being a scholler of <HI>Nestorius</HI> schoole; and the other <HI>Sergius,</HI> of the sect of <HI>Arrius.</HI> Whereupon the principall intention of this cursed law was wholie aimed against the diuini∣tie of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, wickedly oppugned by the Iewes and Arri∣ans. He perswaded this law, first by giuing his wife to vnderstand, and his neighbours by her meanes, and by little and little others also, that he con∣uersed with the angell <HI>Gabriell,</HI> vnto whose brightnes he ascribed the falling sicknes, which many times prostrated him vpon the earth: dilating and am∣plifying the same in like sort, by permitting all that which was plausible to sense and the flesh; as also by offering libertie to all slaues that would come to him, and receiue his law. Wherefore being prosecuted hard by the ma∣sters of those fugitiue slaues led away by him, he fledde to Medina Talna∣bi, and there remained some time. From this flight the Mahumetans fetch the originall of their Hegeira. But questionlesse there was nothing that fur∣thered more the enlargement of the Mahumetan sect, then prosperitic in armes, and the multitude of victories; whereby <HI>Mahumet</HI> ouerthrew the Persians, became lord of Arabia, and draue the Romaines out of Syria. And his successors afterwards extended their empire from Euphrates to the At∣lantick Ocean, and from the riuer Niger to the Pirenei mountaines, and be∣yond. They occupied Sicilia, assailed Italy, and with continuall prosperi∣tie, as it were; for three hundred yeeres, either subdued, or encumbred, both the east &amp; west. But to returne to <HI>Mahumet</HI> his law, it embraceth circumcisi∣on, &amp; maketh a difference between meats pure &amp; vnpure, partly to allure the Iewes. It denieth the Diuinitie of Christ, to reconcile the Arrians, who were then most mightie; it foisteth in many friuolous fables, that it might fit the Gentiles: &amp; looseth the bridle to the flesh, which is a thing acceptable to the greatest part of men. Whereupon <HI>Auicen</HI> (though he were a Mahumetan) writeth thus of such a law: <HI>Lex nostra</HI> (saith he) <HI>quam de dit Mahumeth, &amp;c.</HI> that is to say, <HI>Our Law, which</HI> Mahumet <HI>gaue vs, regardeth the disposition of felicitie or miserie, according to the body. But there is another promise, which concerneth the minde, or the soule: which wise Diuines had a farre greater desire to apprehend, then that of the body, which though it be giuen vnto them, yet re∣spect they it not, nor hold it in any estimation, in comparison of that felicitie which is a coniunction with truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mahumet</HI> being dead, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Haly.</NOTE> <HI>Allé, Abubequer, Omar,</HI> and <HI>Odoman</HI> his kinse∣men, each of them pretending to be his true successor, wrote distinctly eue∣rie one by himselfe. Vpon which there did arise fower seuerall sects. <HI>Allé</HI> was head of the sect Imemia, being followed by the Persians, Indians, and many Arabians, and Gelbines of Africa. <HI>Abubequer</HI> gaue foundation to the sect Melchia, embraced generally by the Arabians, Saracens, and Afri∣cans. <HI>Omar</HI> was author of the Anefia, which is on foote among the Turks in Syria, and in that part of Africk which is called Zahará. <HI>Odman</HI> left be∣him the Banefia, or Xefaia, as we may terme it, which wanteth not follo∣wers among the foresaid nations. Of these fower sects, in processe of time,
<PB N="382" REF="228"/>
growen sixtie eight other verie famous, besides some of lesse renowme and fame. Among the many Mahumetan sects, there are the Morabites, who lead their liues for the most part in Hermitages, and make profession of Morall Philosophie, with certaine principles differing from the Alcoran. One of these was that Morabite, which certaine yeeres past, shewing <HI>Ma∣humet</HI> his name imprinted in his brest (being done with Aqua Fortis, as I suppose, or some such thing) raised vp a great number of Arabians in Africk, and laide siege to Tripolis; where being betraied by his captaine, he remai∣ned the Turkes prisoner, who sent his skin to the grand Signor. This man being in prison, said to an Italian slaue, his familiar, who went to visite him; I greeue at nothing but you Christians, who haue abandoned me. In that the knights of Malta onely sent him small succour, of powder and shot. These Morabites affirme, (to declare some of their fooleries) that when <HI>Allé</HI> fought, he killed ten thousand Christians with one blow of a sworde, and that this sword was an hundred cubits long. Then there is the foolish, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sect of <HI>Cobtini.</HI> One of these shewed himselfe not many yeeres sithence in the market places and quarters of Algier, mounted on a reed, with a bridle and raines of leather, giuing the multitude to vnderstand, that vpon that horse in one night, he rid an hundred leagues; and he was for this greatly honored and reuerenced.</P>
<P>In tract of time, there grew amongst the Mahumetans, through the vani∣tie of their law, and the incredible variety and difference of opinions, great disorders: For their sect being not onely wicked, and treacherous (as we haue declared) but also grosse and foolish, those that made profession thereof to defend and maintaine it, were enforced to make a thousand interpretati∣ons and constructions, far sometimes from reason, and otherwhiles from the expresse words of <HI>Mahumet</HI> him selfe. The <HI>Califas</HI> endeuoured mighti∣ly to reforme this; but their prouisions of greatest importance were two. For first, <HI>Moauia</HI> (this man florished about the yeere of our Lord 770) called an assembly of learned and iudiciall men, to establish that which in their sect should be beleeued, and to this end he caused all the bookes of Mahumet, and his successors, to be gathered together. But they not agreeing amongst themselues, he chose out of them, sixe of the most learned, and shutting them within an house, with the said writings, he commaunded them, that euery one should make choise of that, which seemed best vnto him. These men reduced the Mahumetan doctrine into sixe books, setting downe the pennaltie of losse of life, to them that should otherwise speake, or write of the law. But because the Arabians gaue their mindes to Philosophie, in the vniuersities of Bagdet, Fez, Maroco, and Cordoua (and being of piercing and subtile wits) they could not but looke into the fopperies of their sect. There was added vnto this another prouiso, which was a statute, that forbad them the studie of Philosophie: by meanes of which statute, their Vniuer∣sities before most flourishing, haue within these fower hundred yeeres daily declined. At this day the sects of <HI>Mahumetan</HI> impietie are distinguished
<PB N="383" REF="228"/>
more through the might and power of those nations that follow them, then of themselues: and the principall nations are fower, that is to say, Arabians, Persians, Tartars, and Turks. The Arabians are most superstitious, and zea∣lous. The Persians stand more vpon reason and nature: The Tartars hold much gentilisine and simplicitie: and the Turkes (especially in Europe) are most of them Libertines, and Martialistes.</P>
<P>The Arabians, as they that esteeme it for great glorie, that <HI>Mahumet</HI> was of their nation, and buried in Mecca (or as others thinke in Medina Talna∣bi) haue laboured with all arte, and yet procure to spread their sect ouer the whole world. In India they first preuailed with preaching, and afterwards with armes. Considering that seuen hundred yeeres sithence (king <HI>Perimal</HI> reigning in Malabar) they began there to sow this cockle: and to bring the Gentiles more easily within their net, they tooke (and at this daie take) their daughters to wife, a matter greatly esteemed of them, by reason of these mens wealth. By this policie and the traffike of spices, which yeelded them infinite profite, they quickly set foote, and fastned it in India. They built townes, and planted colonies, and the first place, where they grew to a bodie, was Calicut, which of a small thing, by their concourse and traffike, became a mightie citie. They drew king <HI>Perimal</HI> to their sect, who at their perswasion resolued to go and end his daies at Mecca; and for that purpose he put himselfe onward on the voiage, with certaine ships laden with pepper and other precious commodities: but a terrible tempest met him in the midst of his course, and drowned him in the sea. They inhabite in Mala∣bar where two sorts of Arabians or Moores (as we may terme them) haue more exceedingly increased and preuailed, then in any other part of the In∣dies: one is of strangers that arriue there by reason of the traffike of Arabia, Cambaia, and Persia: and the other be those that dayly are borne of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> father, and a mother Gentile, or both of father and mother Moores, and these (who are called Nateani, and differ from the other people, in per∣son, customes, and habit) make as it were a fourth part of the inhabitants of that countrey. From Malabar, they went to the Maldiue, and Zeilan. Here they began to take vpon them the managing of the customs and imposi∣tions of cities and townes; and by making them greater then in times past, they attained to the grace and fauour of the Princes and Lords, together with great reputation and authority, yea preeminence and superiority ouer the common people: and fauouring those who embraced their sect, daylie preached and diuulged by the Papassi; but holding their hands heauie ouer such as shewed themselues repugnant, they incredibly aduanced mahume∣tisme. Afterwards perceiuing themselues strong and mightie, both in ri∣chesse, and followers, they seazed on the townes and cities. So that at this day, they commaund a good part of the Maldiuae, and the ports of the most noble iland of Zeilan, except that of Columbo where the Portugals haue a fortresse. By like stratagem are they become masters of the west part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, within little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then these two hundred yeeres, first preuailing by
<PB N="384" REF="229"/>
trade, and commerce, then by marriage and affinitie, and last of all by armes. From hence going forwarde, they haue taken into their hands the greatest part of the ports of that large Archipelago of the Luçones, Malu∣cos, Iauas, &amp;c. They are Lords of the citie of Sunda, in the greater Iaua, they enioy the greatest part of the Ilands of Banda, and Maluco; they raigne in Burneo, &amp; Gilolo. They came once as far as Luçon, a most noble Iland, and one of the Philippinas, &amp; had planted therein three colonies. On the other side, they conquered vpon the firme land, first the rich kingdome of Cambaia, &amp; there established their sect, as they did the like, in all the pla∣ces adioining; from hence they went to Bengala, and became Lords there∣of. They cut off by little and little, from the crowne of Siam, the state of Ma∣laca, (which the Portugals holde at this day) as likewise those of Ior, and Pam; and more then two hundred leagues along the coast. Finallie they are entred into the most ample kingdome of China, and haue built Moscheas in the same; and if the Portugals in India and the Malucos, and afterwards the Spaniards in the Philippinas had not met them on the way, and with the gospell and armes, interrupted their course, they would at this instant haue possessed infinite kingdomes of the east: yea in this they are so industrious and bould, to our confusion, that euen the Arabian mariners, that go in the Portugall ships will tarrie behind in the Gentile-townes, thereto publish their sect; and in the yeere 1555. one of these men had passed euen as far as Iapon, for this purpose; so that if the Portugals had not remedied it in due time, he would peraduenture haue wrought there some alteration.</P>
<P>The Persian nation, as touching their sect, a little before our time, haue beene made renowmed among those barbarous people, by the valor and armes of <HI>Ismael,</HI> called the Sophi. This man accounting himselfe to be of the race and blood of Alle, brought his owne sect into credit and reputati∣on, and waged warre against those borderers, who would not accept of it. He wore a redde Turbant, with twelue points or corners, in memoriall of the twelue sonnes of <HI>Ocen,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Alle,</HI> willing that all his followers should weare the like; and many people came in vnto him, and in a maner all those nations which inhabite betweene the riuers Euphrates and Abianus, and between the Caspian sea &amp; the Persian gulphe. <HI>Tammas</HI> his sonne sent the said twelue-cornered Turbant to the Mahumetan Princes of Malabar and Decan, perswading them to receiue it with his sect, and bestowing the title of a king, on whomesoeuer would accept of it, but no others receiued it, saue Nizzamaluco. It is a common voice and opinion, that the greatest part of the Mahumetans of Syria and the lesser Asia follow and affect inwardly the sect of Allé, and of the Persians; the which the Turkes perceiuing in the vp∣roare of Techelle, made a mightie slaughter of them, carrying the kinsemen of the slaine, and those suspected, out of Asia into Europe.</P>
<P>But now let vs passe to the Tartars. These (* as otherwhiles we declared)<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. B. B. Rel. vn. part. 1. lib. 2. dell' Asia.</NOTE> descended of the ten tribes of Israel, being transported by the order and commission of <HI>Salmanazar,</HI> king of the Assirians, beyond India, into the

of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Here degenerating into rude and barbarous customes, and for∣getting in a greate part, or altogether, the Moysaicall ceremonies, they hardly reteined circumcision. They came out of this their banishment, in the yeere of our Lord 1200. and in a small time, with the ruine of infinite nations, made themselues terrible to all the east, and no lesse to the north. Pope Innocent the fourth, being amazed at the horrible storme, that hung ouer the head of Christendome (for they had spread themselues like locusts<NOTE PLACE="marg">With this frier Ascelline was sent Iohannes de Plano Car∣pini, whose voiage is put downe in the first volume of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> voiages.</NOTE> euen to the bankes of Danubius) sent from the councell of Lyons, Fryer <HI>Ascellino,</HI> of the order of Dominicus, with other Fryers, to the great CAN in the yeere 1246. to exhort him to embrace the name and faith of Christ; or at least to let the Christians alone in peace. Of baptisme he accepted not, but promised a league with the Christians, for fiue yeeres. Others notwith∣standing will needes haue it, that he was conuerted, and that taking vp armes in fauour of the Christians, he caused Mustaceno the Califa of Baldach, to dy with famine, amidst the treasures heaped vp by him. But afterwards either hee, or his successor, together with his people, denying their Christianity, became Mahumetans in religion. And sithence that time, the Tartarian name and fame growing obscure, that of the Turkes began to flourish. The Tartars <HI>Petegorski</HI> notwithstanding vpon the mountaines of Cumania, re∣mained firme in the Christian faith, but yet corrupted with the errors of the Greekes and Moscouites. The Colmugineere the Caspian sea, continued in Paganisme, who are termed Capigliati, because they shaue not off their hayres, as the other Tartarsdo. The Kirgessi also be Idolaters, as otherwhiles we declared. The other Tartars that are come on this side of Imaus, haue all, from one to an other, embraced Mahumetisme. And amongst others the Zagatai, who through the emulation they haue with the Persians (vpon whome they border and contend for Empire) as concerning sect, follow the opinion of the Turkes, as also the Mogores their descendents, who in these our dayes haue enlarged their Empire, betweene mount Caucasus and the Ocean, and between Ganges, and Indus. But the Tartars of Cataya, resident beyond Imaus, and vpon the desert called Lop, remaine generallie in Idolatry, although there continue many Christians amongst them, of the sect of Nestorius, neither want there some Mahumetans.</P>
<P>Now let vs come to the Turkes; who in largenes of Empire, are superior to the other sects. Of these, part inhabite in Asia, part in Europe. Those of Asia incline much to the opinion of the Persians, and especially they that inhabite in Natolia, and the borders. But those of Europe are generally lesse superstitious then the Asians, and by reason of their daily conuersation with Christians, they haue a deeper opinion and conceit of Christ then the others, yea, and many of them hold him for God, and Redeemer. And it is not long sithence there were diuers put to death in Constantinople with speciall constancie on their part: and it was thought that many of the grand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> court held the same opinion. The Turkes, especially those of Eu∣rope, are of two sorts: for some are naturall Turkes, others accessorie, or ac∣cidentall.
<PB N="386" REF="230"/>
Naturall I terme them, that are borne of Turkish parents: and them I call accidentall, who leauing our sacred faith, or the Moysaicall law, be∣come Mahumetans: the which the Christians performe by circumcising themselues, and the Iewes by lifting vp a finger. Now the Christians be∣come Turkes, partly vpon some extreme &amp; violent passion. <HI>Cherseogli</HI> (who afterwards was great with <HI>Bazaieth</HI>) turned Turke to bee reuenged of his father, who tooke from him his wife, amidst the solemnitie of the marriage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or Olouchali.</NOTE> <HI>Vlucciali</HI> denied the faith to be reuēged of a slaue, his companion in the gal∣lie, who called him scald pate. Some abiure the faith to release themselues of torments and cruelties; others for hope of honors and temporall great∣nes: and of these two sorts there are a great number in Constantinople, be∣ing thought to be Christians in hart: and yet through slothfulnes, or first to gather togither more wealth, or expecting opportunitie to carrie with them, their wiues and children, or for feare of being discouered in their de∣parture and voiage, or else through sensualitie, and for that they would not be depriued of the licentiousnes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the life they lead, resolue not to performe that they are bound vnto; deferring thus from moneth to moneth, &amp; from yeere to yeere, to leaue this Babylon &amp; sinke of sin. But the greatest part of Renegados become Mahumetans without perceiuing it. In that the grand Signor sendeth euery fower yeers, more or lesse, according as need requireth, to take through his states of Europe, of euery three christian male children one, at the discretion of his Commissaries, by way of tribute, and they take them from the age of ten, to the yeeres of seuenteene. These being brought to Constantinople, are without other ceremonies circumci∣sed, and part of them are sent into Natolia and Caramania to learne the toong, religion, and fashions of the Turkes: and part are emploied about the seruice of the Seraglios, or palaces of Constantinople, Pera, and Andri∣nople. Heere liuing among the Turkes, farre from their parents, separate from all conuersation with the faithfull, and depriued of all spirituall aide and helpe, without perceiuing, it they are made Turkes. The author of this, the most diabolicall institution that euer was made, was a certaine Turkish saint, called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as,</HI> in the daies of <HI>Amurath</HI> the second: and in the be∣ginning the number was but three thousand, and afterwards they exceeded not twelue thousand, vntill the time of <HI>Amurath</HI> the third, who increased them to the number of fower and twentie thousand. But returning to their education: after some time they are called home againe to the Seraglios of the Zamoglans (for so are they termed, till they be enrolled among the Ianissaries) to remaine there vnder their heads and gouernours: and in short time they become Ianissaries, or Spahies, and either they go to the warre, or are bestowed in some garrison, or else are resident in the court of the Turke. They are called The sonnes of the grand Signor: they liue with great license and libertie: they do whatsoeuer pleaseth themselues: neither can they be iudged by any but the Agaes: during their liues they are seldōtimes punished, and yet when it is done, it is with great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: in buying they
<PB N="387" REF="230"/>
make their owne prizes. These snares are strong enough to procure, that they neuer care for returning any more to the bosome of the church. But that which is woorst of all: euery new Prince bestoweth on them a great larges, and augmenteth their pay, at the Christians charge. They also kill and robbe whomsoeuer they please, especially the Christians throughout the whole countrie, or in marching to the warre, and the Christians dare not so much as in a word finde themselues agreeued: whereupon there groweth in them such a scorne and contempt of the Christian name, that they re∣maine strangers to it. That which I haue said of yoong male children taken from out their mothers bosomes, who without perceiuing it become Ma∣humetanes, hapneth in like manner vnto them, whom the pirates by sea, or soldiers by land make slaues, presenting them to the grand Signor. Besides the foresaid deuises, the Turkes further spread abroad their sect with all kind of vantage and furtherance. For they abase and bring to extreme miserie the Christians and Moores their subiects, not permitting them to ride, nor beare any kinde of armes, nor to exercise any maner of iustice, or gouern∣ment. They make it lawfull to take Christian women that are not married. If the wife of a Christian turneth Turke, and marrieth herselfe with a Turke, their law permitteth, that the Christian husband by turning Turke may take her againe. They forbid the Christians to repaire their ruinate Churches, and suffer them in no wise to reedifie them fallen downe, without great bribes; and so the Christians through pouertie let them come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: by meanes where of the publike worship of God faileth, and in progresse of time also, the very Christian faith and beleefe. In Asia they will not permit the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the vse of their language, but onely in sacred administrations, to the end that togither with their language, they may also loose and forget their Christian fashions and customes. The Spahi being Lords for terme of life, of infinite villages, take such young men into their seruitude, as best pleaseth them; who in processe of time, by cōuersation with their maisters, and the fauours they hope after, and by the wicked fashions and customes which they learne, as also through the sinnes and vices, wherein they are drowned, do become Turkes. And the Greekes children, after the example of their companions, being thus fauoured and made much of, incline in such a sort vnto this euill, that vpon euery light occasion, they threaten their fathers and mothers to turne Turkes. Further it is forbidden the Mahume∣tanes to make restitution of any place, once taken with armes, and wherein they haue built a Moschea. To conclude, they vse all manner of circum∣stances, by meane of which they may amplifie or enlarge their dominion and sect.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Mahumetans of Africa in particular.</HEAD>
<P>THe Mahumetan impietie hath spred it selfe throughout A∣frica beyond measure: this pestilence entred into Egypt in the yeere of our Lord 637. by the armes of <HI>Omar.</HI> From whence a captaine of <HI>Odoman</HI> first passed into Africa in the yeere 650. with fower-score thousand fighting men, who there defeated <HI>Gregorius Patritius.</HI> But they perpetually cast out of Africk the Romaines with the people of Absimacus, and <HI>Leontius</HI> the emperour, in the yeere 699. and wholie impatronized themselues of Barbarie. They pier∣ced into Numidia &amp; Libya in the yeere 710. and ouerthrew the Azanaghi, and the people of Gualata, Oden, and Tombuto. The yeere afterwards 973. hauing passed Gambea, they infected the Negroes, and the first that drunke of their poison were those of Melli. In the yeere 1067. <HI>Iaiaia</HI> the sonne of <HI>Abubequer</HI> entred into the lower Ethiopia, and by little and little subuerted those people which confine vpon the deserts of Libya and Egypt, piercing euen to Nubia &amp; Guinea. The Arabiās haue augmēted their sect in Africk, first with force of armes, by banishing of the naturall inhabitants, the which they might well do, by reason of their infinite multitude: and of them, that verse of <HI>Dauid</HI> may well be vnderstood: <HI>In circuitu impij ambulant: secundum altitudinem tuam, multiplicasti filios hominum, &amp;c.</HI> The wicked walke round about; according to thy greatnes, thou hast multiplied the sonnes of men. Where they could not come, nor giue no blow with armes; there they haue ingraffed themselues, by preaching and traffike. The heresie of <HI>Arrius</HI> fur∣thered their enterprize, wherewith the Vandales and Gothes being then in∣habiters of Africa were infected. To further their designments they brought in the Arabicke language and letters. They founded Vniuersities and Stu∣dies, both for riches of reuenew, and magnificence of building most no∣ble, especially in Maroco, and Fez. But there is nothing that hath greatlier furthered the progression of the Mahumetan sect, then perpetuitie of victo∣rie, &amp; the greatnes of conquests, first of the Califas in the east, &amp; afterwards of the Miramolines in Affrick: In that the greatest part of men, yea, and in a manner all, except such as haue fastned their confidence vpon the crosse of Christ, and setled their hope in eternity, follow that which best agreeth with sense, and measure the grace of God by worldly prosperitie. And yet Christ (as <HI>Iustinus</HI> the Philosopher, and glorious martyr testifieth) promised no earthly reward to good works. Carnal men therefore perceiuing the empire of the Califas and Mahumetans continually to encrease in the east and west, taking into their hands both sea and land, (for this their felicitie in armes continued three hundred yeeres, wherein they conquered all that which lieth betweene the riuer Abianus and the Atlantike Ocean, and sub∣dued Spaine, Sicilia, and a part of Italie and France) and iudging that tem∣porall prosperitie and victories were the effects and fruits, or at least the
<PB N="389" REF="231"/>
arguments and signes of the grace and fauour of God, they easily fell into Apostasie, whereunto the impietie of <HI>Arrius</HI> and other heretikes opened the way, who for long tract of time estranging themselues more and more from the Euangelicall truth, fell in the end into Atheisme: as we see hath fallen out in the course of some moderne enormities. But to returne from whence we haue digressed; in progresse of time there grew great differen∣ces betweene the Mahumetans: for their sect being no lesse sottish and foolish, then wicked and perfidious, the mainteiners of it were driuen to fetch reasons farre off for defence of the same. But the Arabians not con∣tented in Africa to haue subiugated with armes, and with false doctrine to haue pestered Barbarie, Numidia, Libya, and the countrey of Negroes, they further on the other side assailed the lower Ethiopia, both by sea and land. By lande entred thereinto in the yeere 1067. <HI>Faiaia</HI> the sonne of <HI>Abubequer,</HI> and by meanes of certaine Alsachi, he dispersed that pesti∣lence into Nubia, and the neighbour prouinces. On the other side passing the Red sea, they first tooke knowledge of the coast of Ethiopia, euen to Cabo de los corrientes, by their continuall traffike thither: and afterwards being encouraged by the weakenes of the naturall inhabitants, they erected the kingdomes of Magadazo, Melinde, Mombazza, Quiloa, Mozambi∣que, and seazed on some ports of the island of Saint Laurence: and gathe∣ring force by little and little, they enlarged their empire within the land, and established therein the kingdomes of Dangali and Adel. So that on the one side they haue spred their sect, from the Red sea to the Atlantike Oce∣an, and from the Mediterran sea to the riuer Niger, and farther: and on the other, haue taken into their hands all the easterne coast of Africk, from Suez to Cape Guardafú, and from this, euen to that De los corrientes, and the adioining islands. In which places though the people be not altogither Mahumetans, yet haue the Mahumetans the weapons &amp; dominion in their hands; the which how much it importeth for the bringing in of sects, we may easily conceiue. To conclude, they haue often assailed the <HI>Prete Ianni;</HI> sometimes the Turkes, who haue taken from him the ports of the Red sea; and otherwhiles the Moores, vnder the conduct of the king of Adel, who hath, and doth molest them greatly, leading into captituitie a great number of Abassins, where they become for the most part Mahumetans.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Christians in Egypt.</HEAD>
<P>THe Christians of Egypt are partly strangers, partlie home-borne in the country; strangers come thither in regarde of traffick which there flourisheth aboue measure, especiallie in the cities of Alexandria and Cairo; by reason that this kingdome being most commodiously situate betweene the Red and Mediterran seas, vniteth the west parts of the world with the east, by meane of an infinite traffick; and therefore is it as it were a ladder, whereby the wealth of India and of the Eoan Ocean, passeth into the lesser Asia, into Africke, and Europe. Whereupon not onely the Veneti∣ans, Florentines, and Ragusians come thither in great numbers; but also the French, and English. The naturall Christians of Egypt, remaining after the spoiles and hauock of the Barbarians and the crueltie of the Saracens, Ma∣malucks, and Turkes, exceed not the number of fiftie thousand persons, and these dwell dispersed here and there, but principallie in the cities of Cairo, Messia, Monfalatto, Bucco, and Elchiasa, all placed vpon the bankes of Ni∣lus. There are also many in the prouince of Minia, in which quarter appeare diuers monasteries. But among the monasteries of Egypt those of Saint <HI>Anthonie,</HI> Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> and Saint <HI>Macarius</HI> are the principal. The first lieth in Troglodytica right ouer against Sait vpon a hill, where Saint <HI>Anthony</HI> was said to be beaten by diuels: the second is seated not far from this, in the mid∣dest of a desert: the third standeth in the wildernes, to the west of Bulac. This is the monasterie which in some histories is called Nitria, as I thinke, bicause in that quarter the waters of Nilus, being thickned by the heate of the sun in low places, are conuerted into salt and niter. Georgia stood vpon Nilus, six miles from the city of Munsia, a rich and magnificent Conuent, so called after the name of Saint <HI>George.</HI> There were in the same more then two hundred monkes, to the notable benefite and ease of pilgrimes &amp; stran∣gers, who were there curteously lodged. But they dying all of the plague, (about some hundred and fiftie yeeres sithence,) the place was abandoned.</P>
<P>Now to deliuer somewhat concerning the estates of these Christians: They are called by some<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Coptitae.</NOTE> Cofti, and by others, Christians from the girdle vpward: for albeit they be baptized, as we are, yet do they circumcise them∣selues like to the Iewes: so as a man may say, their Christianitie comes no lower then the girdle-stead. But that which is woorse, they haue for these 1000. yeers followed the heresie of <HI>Eutiches,</HI> which alloweth but of one na∣ture in Christ: by which heresie they also separate and dismember them∣selues,
<PB N="391" REF="232"/>
from the vnion of the Church of Europe. The occasion of this se∣paration and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, was the Ephesine councell, assembled by <HI>Dioscorus</HI> in defence of <HI>Eutiches,</HI> who was now condemned in the Calcedon coun∣sell by sixe hundred and thirtie fathers congregated togither, by the autho∣ritie of <HI>Leo</HI> the first. For the Cofti fearing, that to attribute two natures vn∣to Christ, might be all one, as if they had assigned him two hypostases or persons, to auoid the heresie of the Nestorians, they became Eutichians. They say their diuine seruice in the Chaldean toong, oftentimes repeating Alleluia. They read the Gospell first in Chaldean, and then in Arabick. When the priest saieth <HI>Pax vobis,</HI> the yoongest amongst them laieth his hand vpon all the people that are present. After consecration, they giue a simple peece of bread to the standers by: a ceremonie vsed also in Greece. They exercise their function in the church of Saint Marke amidst the ruines of Alexandria, and in that of Suez, vpon the red sea: they obey the Patriarke of Alexandria, and affirme themselues to be of the faith of <HI>Prete Ianni.</HI> In our daies two Popes haue attempted to reduce them to the vnion of the Romish church; <HI>Pius</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Gregorie</HI> the thirteenth. <HI>Pius</HI> the fourth in the yeere 1563. sent two Iesuit-priests for this purpose to Cairo; who staied there almost a yeere, but to no purpose, and with great danger of life: for one of them was appointed to the fire, from which he escaped by meanes of a merchant; who with eight hundred crownes paci∣fied the Turkes, and caused the priest sodainly to flie away. But Pope <HI>Grego∣rie</HI> entred into this enterprise with more hope: for <HI>Paulo Mariani</HI> a famous Christian merchant, was at the same time in Cairo, who for his wisedome, magnificence, knowledge of toongs, and long practise in the affaires of the world, ioined with woonderfull eloquence, and presence of bodie, was in great esteeme and reputation, not onely among the Christians, but also with the Turkes, who equally loued him for his liberality, and honored him for his valour. This man had conference with the Patriarke of Alexandria about the reconciling of his people to the Romish church: whereunto the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not shewing himselfe difficult, or hard to be entreated, was con∣tented to call by his letters into those parts, two priests of the same order, who were then with the Maronites in mount Libanus. In the meane while the Pope, who was aduertised of al this busines, taking the matter quickly in hand, wrote vnto the two priests, appointing one of them to go directlie to Cairo; and the other to returne back to Rome. Wherefore in the yeere 1582 in the moneth of October one of the said priests arriuing at Cairo, was courteouslie receiued by Mariani, and afterwards conducted to the Pa∣triarke, who also made shew of great ioy and consolation. One might like∣wise perceiue a reasonable disposition in others who had any authority a∣mong the Cofti. He aduertised the Pope of all; who sent a certaine other priest, with one breefe to the Patriarke, and an other to the Iesuites, wherein he exhorted them to go forward, and to bring the vnion, whereof so assured hope was conceiued, to good effect. The Patriarke receiued the breefe
<PB N="392" REF="233"/>
with great reuerence he kissed it, and according to their custome, laide it vpon his head, and afterwards demanded what it comprehended: the which with great feeling, and contentment hauing vnderstood, within fewe daies he instituted a Synod of some bishops, and certaine other principall per∣sons of the nation. Heere the said priests hauing declared vnto them vpon how little ground they, who at the first receiued the faith from Saint <HI>Marke,</HI> were sequestred from the western church by the authoritie of one heretike, tooke much paines afterward in making them capable of the difference that is betweene a nature and an Hypostasis or person, to their exceeding great admiration, bicause they were in a manner destitute of all learning. For the Patriarke euen from his youth had led his life in the monasterie of Saint Macarius, farre not onely from the studies of learning, but also from the conuersation of men, neither appeered there any greater knowledge in the bishops. They had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any booke of the ancient fathers, and yet those they had, were all dustie, and eaten with mothes: That where of they made chiefest account, was an old volume, being torne and rent, which they cal∣led <HI>The confession of the Fathers,</HI> full of diuers dreames and fables, whereof notwithstanding, and of some other Arabicke bookes, the priests made speciall good vse, for the conuincing of them in their errors. Also hauing framed a <HI>compendium</HI> of most necessarie doctrine, they caused diuers copies of the same to be drawne, and gaue them to the learned of the Cofti, to be considered of, who wondring at the strangenes of the things propounded vnto them, and not knowing how to answer the arguments of the priestes, demaunded time to search their owne writings, and to see what opinion their predecessors had held as concerning that point. In the meane while, they came often to the priests, and inquired of them the doctrine and forme of speech vsed in the Romish church. Whereupon they shewed them how greatly the same church had euer detested heresies: and how se∣uerely it had condemned the impietie of <HI>Nestorius,</HI> and contrariwise high∣ly esteemed the authoritie of <HI>Cyrillus Alexandrinus,</HI> and the decrees of the first Ephesine Councell. Neither (bicause it confesseth two natures in Christ, ioined in one person without confusion) doth it therefore inferre two hypostasis or persons. In that a nature and a person are not the selfe same things. The which may cleerely be vnderstoode by the deepe mysterie of the holy Trinitie, wherein we acknowledge one nature, and three Hypo∣stasis or persons. We auer therfore, that there are two natures in Christ, one diuine, which he hath eternally from his Father, the other humane, which he tooke temporally from the immaculate wombe of his mother; both of them ioined in one hypostasis or person. By these and other like demon∣strations, they cleered the vnderstandings, and confirmed the mindes of the Cofti. Howbeit, all this notwithstanding, the Synod being againe assem∣bled (wherein were present, the Patriarke, fiue bishops, diuers abbots of monasteries, and thirtie other principall persons) they plainly answered the priests that they had turned ouer their Annales &amp; writings, &amp; were resolued
<PB N="393" REF="233"/>
in no wise to depart from the doctrine and faith of their predecessors. This vnlooked-for answer, though it greatly troubled and displeased the priests, yet were they determined still to continue, and to proceed further in the en∣terprise. Whereupon declaring vnto them againe, how farre they were by <HI>Dioscorus</HI> meanes estranged from the doctrine taught in the Nicen, Con∣stantinopolitan, and first Ephesine councels, grounded on the authoritie of holy Scripture, and the ancient Fathers: and that to disallow of two natures in Christ, was no other but to denie, that he was neither true God nor man, (a matter abhominable, not only to their eares, but euen to their very vnder∣stādings) they preuailed so much, as that the matter was yet deferred off to an other moneth. Being therefore congregated the third time, it seemed that God himselfe furthered this affaire more then vsually: for first with com∣mon consent they abrogated the law of circumcision, and withall after a disputation of sixe howers continuance, it was decreed, that as concerning the truth of this point, the priests were to be beleeued, that there were two natures in Christ, and that the Cofti though they auoided the name and title of two natures, yet denied they not, but that Christ was true man, and true God. Onely they were warie of the two natures, for feare of falling by litle &amp; litle into two hypostases. Thus this busines being brought to so good a passe, was by the ambition and obstinacie of one man vtterly crossed and hindred. This was the Vicar or Suffragan to the Patriarke, who aspiring himselfe to the Patriarkship, and seeing that if he followed this vnion be∣gun with the Romaine church, he could not attaine to that dignitie, but by the Popes authoritie, (which he altogither misdoubted) he first made the decree of two natures to be deferred, commanding afterwards that none should subscribe thereunto, and finally caused the Patriarke wholie to giue ouer this busines, and to retire himselfe into the wildernes; whereas he con∣tinued for certaine months. Afterwards the priests vnderstanding where he was, wrot vnto him a letter, signifying therein, what a special desire they had to see him, and what domage the retiring of himselfe would procure to the sillie sheepe recommended vnto him by God, if he ratified not fully those things which were decreed vpon in the laft assemblie. He curteously answe∣red, making shew, that he would returne, when he had visited his dioces, and in the meane while they should expect him at Cairo. But while he thought vpon returne, his owne death interrupted him. The Cofti haue a law, or custome, that betweene the death of one Patriarke and the creation of an other, there must be in a maner an whole yeeres space, for so long it is requisite, say they, that the church should bewaile the death of her spouse. Whereupon the priests, not to loose so much time, determined to go home into Italy, to acquaint the Pope with the successe of all things, and afterwards (neede so requiring) to returne. The Cofti vnderstanding thus much, writ letters to the Pope, wherin they partly thanked him for the care he had of them; &amp; partly lamented, that their recōciliation with the Romish church was not fully confirmed and finished. While the priests were about
<PB N="294" REF="234"/>
to depart on Saint Mathewes day in the morning, there came a route of ar∣med Turkes to their lodging. These layde hands suddenly on two priests, and another companion of theirs, and on three Fryers of the order of Saint Francis, lodged in the same house. No man knew the reason of this hurly burly, but for as much as could be learned, all this grew through the enuie of a Frenchman. This man aspiring to the degree of Consull or Gouernor ouer his nation, which <HI>Mariani</HI> had obtayned, maliciously gaue the Bassa of Cairo to vnderstād, that <HI>Mariani</HI> suborned the people against the grād Sig∣nor, &amp; that he had order from the K. of Spaine to leuie Christian men. And that to this end he kept in his house certaine priests, who practised in this be∣half with <HI>Mariani</HI> for the king. There was nothing that more preiudiced the priests, then the Cofties letters, which bred a vehement suspition in the Turkes, that such an vnion might be concluded with the Roman Church, as might worke some extraordinarie innouation. They were therefore cast into a filthie and stinking prison. The Venetian Consull assayed first by word of mouth, and after by suite and supplication, to asswage the furie and anger of the Bassá; Howbeit he receiued such bitter and nipping answeres, that he himselfe was also afraid. But nothing preuaileth further with the Turkes then money. For it seemeth that with this onely their sauage furie is mitigated, and their fiercenes appeased. Fiue thousand crownes therefore were disbursed for the priests libertie, wherein the Cofti shewed themselues verie friendly, the richest of them offering one after another to lend money without any interest for the same. But this matter cost <HI>Mariani</HI> more then ten thousand crownes; and besides that, he was depriued of his degree of Consulship. The priests being thus freed out of prison, and obseruing how things went, returned one after another backe to Rome.</P>

<P><HI>NOndum</HI> (saith hee) <HI>vni us seculi aet as exacta est</HI> &amp;c. The space of one hundred yeeres is not as yet fullie expi∣red, since the fame of the Ethiopians religion came first vnto our eares. Which, because it is in many points agreeable vnto Christian veritie, and carrieth an honest shew of pietie therewith, is to be esteemed as a matter most worthie of our knowledge. Of this therefore, so far forth as the short time of an oration will permit, I purpose to intreate; to the end it may appeare, both where, and what manner of Christian church that of Ethiopia is, and what were the first beginnings thereof.</P>
<P>This Ethiopian, not vnfitly called <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">As the church in all the hither parts of Europe hath beene cal∣led the western, and that of Greece and A∣sia, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> church.</NOTE> The southerne church, is situate in Africa far south, namely vnder the Torrid Zone, betweene the Tropique of Cancer and the Equinoctial; some part thereof also stretching beyond the Equinoctial, towards the Tropique of Capricorne. Two summers they haue euery yeere, yea in a manner, one continual summer: so that at the ve∣ry same time in some fields they sowe, and in others they reape. Somewhere also they haue euery moneth ripe, some kinde of earthlie fruits or other, es∣peciallie pulse. The people are skorched with the heate of the sun, and they are black, and go naked: saue onely that some couer their priuities with cloth of cotton or of silke. The countrie is very great, and containeth well nie twentie kingdomes; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Whātsoeuer Dresserus think eth; yet diuers other authors of good note do hold the domi∣nions of Prete Ianni to be no∣thing so large.</NOTE> so that it is almost as large as Europe, or as all Christendome in these parts. At the beginning indeed it had not aboue two kingdomes; but in processe of time it was mightily enlarged by the con∣quest of countries adiacent. For it is enuironed on all sides by vnbeleeuing gentiles and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who are most deadlie enimies to the Christian religion; with whome the emperour of Ethiopia is at continuall wars, ende∣uouring by all possible meanes to reclaime them from their heathenish Idolatry to the faith of Iesus Christ. It is reported that certaine bordering <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">These Mores are called Do∣bas.</NOTE> Mores beare such implacable hatred against these Christians, that none of them may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, before he bringeth testimony, that he hath slaine twelue of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Ethiopia is not called (as some imagine) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or
<PB N="396" REF="235"/>
priest; but Pretious <HI>Iohn.</HI> For in the Ethiopian toung he is termed Belul Gi∣an, and in the Chaldean, Encoe Gian, both which additions signifie preti∣ous or high; so that in a maner he commeth neer vnto the titles of our prin∣ces, who are called Illustres, Excelsi, Serenissimi, &amp;c. to signifie, that they are exalted and aduanced aboue other people. And this is a common name to all the christian kings of Ethiopia; as <HI>Pharao</HI> was to the Egyptian kings, and <HI>Augustus,</HI> to the Roman emperours. Neither is this Pretious <HI>Iohn</HI> a priest by profession, but a ciuil magistrate; nor is he armed so much with religion and lawes, as with military forces.</P>
<P>Howbeit he calleth himselfe The piller of faith; because he is the main∣tainer of the Christian faith, not onely enioining his owne subiects to the obseruation thereof; but (what in him lyeth) enforcing his enemies also to embrace it.</P>
<P>In times past Ethiopia was gouerned by Queenes onely. Whereupon we reade in the history of the old testament, that the Queene of the south came to King <HI>Salomon</HI> from Saba, to heare his admirable wisedome, about the yeere of the world 2954. The name of this Queen (as the Ethiopians report) was <HI>Maqueda,</HI> who from the head-city of Ethiopia called Saba (which like an Isle, is enuironed on all sides by the riuer Nilus) trauelled by Egypt and the Red sea to Ierusalem. And she brought vnto <HI>Salomon</HI> an hun∣dred &amp; twenty talents of gold, which amount to 720000. golden ducates of Hungarie, that is, seuen tunnes of gold, and 20000 Hungarian ducates be∣sides. This mightie sum of gold, with other things of great value, she pre∣sented vnto <HI>Salomon,</HI> who likewise requited her with most princely giftes. She contended with him also in propounding of sage questions, &amp; obscure riddles. Amongst other matters (as it is reported by <HI>Cedrenus</HI>) she brought before him certaine damosels, and yoong men in maides attire, asking the king, how he could discerne one sexe from another. He answered, that he would finde them out by the washing of their faces. And foorthwith he commanded all their faces to be washed, and they which washed themselues strongly, were found to be males; but the residue by their tender washing be∣wraied themselues to be damosels.</P>
<P>The Ethiopian kings suppose, that they are descended from the linage of <HI>Dauid,</HI> and from the family of <HI>Salomon.</HI> And therefore they vse to terme themselues the sonnes of <HI>Dauid,</HI> and of <HI>Salomon,</HI> and of the holy patriarkes also, as being sprung from their progenie. For Queene <HI>Maqueda</HI> (say they) had a sonne by <HI>Salomon,</HI> whome they named <HI>Meilech.</HI> But afterward he was called <HI>Dauid.</HI> This <HI>Meilech</HI> (as they report) being growen to twentie yeeres of age, was sent backe by his mother vnto his father and instructor <HI>Salomon,</HI> that he might learne of him, wisedome and vnderstanding. Which so soone as the said <HI>Meilech</HI> or <HI>Dauid</HI> had attained: by the permission of <HI>Salomon,</HI> ta∣king with him many priests and nobles, out of all the twelue tribes, he retur∣ned to his kingdome of Ethiopia, and tooke vpon him the gouernment thereof. As likewise he carried home with him the law of God, and the rite
<PB N="397" REF="235"/>
of circumcision.</P>
<P>These were the beginnings of the Iewish religion in Ethiopia. And it is reported, that euen till this present none are admitted into any ministry or canonship in the court, but such as are descended of their race that came first out of Iury. By these therfore the doctrine of God in Ethiopia was first planted, which afterward tooke such deepe root, as it hath since remained to all succeeding ages. For the Ethiopians did both retaine the bookes of the Prophets, and trauailed also to Ierusalem, that they might there worship the true God reuealed in the kingdome of Israel. Which manifestly appeereth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts of the Apost. cap. 8. verse 26.</NOTE> out of the Historie of the Ethiopian Eunuch, whose name was <HI>Indich,</HI> which was a principall gouernour vnder Queene <HI>Candaces,</HI> properly called <HI>Iudith.</HI> For he about the tenth yeere after the death and resurrection of our blessed Sauiour, trauailed for the space of two hundred and fortie miles, to Ierusalem. Where hauing performed due worship vnto God, returning homeward, as he sate in his chariot, he read the prophet <HI>Esaias.</HI> And by the commandement of the holy Spirit, <HI>Philip</HI> one of Christ his disciples was sent vnto him. And when they were both come to the citie Bethzur, three miles distant from Ierusalem; the Eunuch at the foote of a mountaine espied a certaine water, wherein he was baptized by <HI>Philip.</HI> And being re∣turned into Ethiopia, this Eunuch baptized the Queene, and a great part of her family and people. From which time the Ethiopians began to be Chri∣stians, who since that haue continually professed the Christian faith.</P>
<P>They beleeue also that <HI>Philip</HI> sent into Ethiopia a disciple of his called <HI>Lycanon,</HI> who (as they suppose) ordained the verie forme of religion which they now holde.</P>
<P>Now these beginnings aswel of the Iewish as the christian religion among the Ethiopians being thus declared: we are next to intreat of the doctrine &amp; religion it selfe, togither with the rites &amp; ceremonies vsed at this present in the Ethiopicke church, so far foorth as we can gather out of the ambassages which haue bin performed from these parts thither, &amp; backe againe. Besides which there is no historie nor discourse of any worth to be found, which en∣treateth of the religion, maners, and customes of the Ethiopians. So as it is a matter very strange, that for so many hundred yeeres togither, Ethiopia was so barred from our knowledge, that we had not so much as any report thereof. Vntill about the yeere of our Lord 1440. certaine ambassadours sent from thence to Pope <HI>Eugenius,</HI> returned backe with his letters, and Pa∣pall benediction to their king. Which letters are most charily kept among the records of this Ethiopian king, and are preserued for perpetuall monuments.</P>
<P>From which time also, as though Ethiopia had beene againe quire de∣barred from the knowledge and conuersation of our men, there were not any Europeans that went into Ethiopia, nor any Ethiopians that came into Europe, till the yeere of our Lord 1486. what time <HI>Iohn</HI> the second king of Portugall sent <HI>Pedro de Couilham,</HI> and <HI>Alonço de Paiua,</HI> to search out
<PB N="398" REF="236"/>
Ethiopia. This <HI>Pedro</HI> was a man very learned, eloquent, skilfull in sundrie languages, painfull in his endeuors, fortunate in his attempts, and most desi∣rous to finde out new countries and people both by sea and land. He there∣fore in the yeere aboue mentioned, togither with his companion <HI>Alon∣ço de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> (who died in the voiage) trauailed first to Alexandria and Cai∣ro in Egypt: from whence in the companie of certaine Mores of Fez and Tremizen, he proceeded on to El Tor, an hauen towne vpon the Arabian shore of the Red sea, and thence to Aden, situate without the entrance of the Arabian gulfe. Where hauing embarqued himselfe in a ship of Mores, he trauailed to Calicut, Goa, and other places of the east Indies; and being fully informed of the state of the Spiceries, he crossed ouer the maine Oce∣an to çofala, sailed thence to Ormuz, and then returned backe to Cairo. From whence (hauing dispatched letters vnto his king) in the company of <HI>Rabbi Ioseph</HI> a Iew, he made a second voiage to Ormuz; and in his returne he tooke his iourney towards Ethiopia, the Emperour whereof at that time, was called <HI>Alexander.</HI> Vnto whom when he had deliuered a letter and a mappe of the world sent from king <HI>Iohn,</HI> he was most kindly entertained, and rewarded with many rich gifts. And albeit he most earnestly desired to returne into his owne countrey, yet could he neuer obtaine leaue; but had wealth, honour, and a wife of a noble family bestowed vpon him, to asswage his desire of returning home. Wherefore in the yeere 1526. which was fortie yeeres after his departure out of Portugall, hee was left, by <HI>Rodrigo de Lima</HI> the Portugall ambassadour, still remaining in the court of <HI>Prete Ianni.</HI></P>
<P>In all this meane while sundry Portugals came out of India to the court of the <HI>Prete,</HI> not so much to visite and salute him, as to declare the good will and kinde affection of their king towards him. Whereupon Queene <HI>Hele∣na,</HI> which was then protectresse of the Ethiopian or Abassin empire, to re∣quite the king of Portugal with like friendship; sent vnto him in the compa∣ny of the foresaid Portugals an ambassador or messenger of hers, called <HI>Matthew,</HI> who was a merchant borne in Armenia, being a man skilfull in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matthew the first ambassa∣dor sent from Aethiopia to Portugall.</NOTE> sundry languages and in many other matters. This <HI>Matthew</HI> shee not onely furnished with letters requisite for such an ambassage; but enioined him al∣so to declare by word of mouth vnto the king of Portugal the principall heads of their doctrine or beleefe, together with their rites and customes, and the present state of the whole church of Ethiopia. Moreouer shee pre∣sented him with a little crosse made (as they suppose) of a piece of that very crosse, whereon our sauiour Christ was crucified; with many other tokens and pledges of mutuall christian amity. Thus <HI>Matthew</HI> being dismissed, tooke his iourney to the east Indies; from whence he was conducted by sea into Portugal; where arriuing in the yeere 1513, he did his message, ac∣cording to Queene <HI>Helenas</HI> directions, vnto the king <HI>Don Emanuel.</HI></P>

For he remaining sixe whole yeeres in the court and countrie of Ethiopia, tooke there most diligent notice of all matters worthie the obseruation. And he had often and familiar conference not onely with the emperour himselfe, but also with the patriarke, concerning the whole state of their religion, and of matters ecclesiasticall; as also he was a most curious obseruer of all their rites and ceremonies. Who in the yeere of Christ 1526. being dismissed by <HI>Prete Ianni,</HI> was accompanied into<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zagazabo the second ambas∣sador sent from AEthiopia to Portugall.</NOTE> Portugall by another Ethiopian or Abassin ambassadour called <HI>Zagazabo,</HI> and brought letters also to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the seuenth, with a golden crosse of a pound weight. It seemeth likewise that the said ambassadour of <HI>Prete Ianni</HI> was a very honest, vpright, and godly man, who by reason of their continuall warres was detained in Portugall till the yeere of our Lord 1539.</P>
<P>The letters of <HI>Prete Ianni</HI> to the Pope, were by <HI>Francis Aluarez</HI> deliue∣red at Bononia, in the yeere of Christ 1533. Where in the presence of <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour, and before a mightie assembly of people, they were read and approoued with great ioy and acclamation. Both which letters, as well to the Pope as to the king <HI>Don Emanuel,</HI> were full of Christian pietie and loue: wherein first that mightie Emperour (though therein he was de∣ceiued) with singular reuerence and dutie, submitted himselfe vnto the Pope of Rome, as to the head of all the church; offering by the said <HI>Fran∣cis</HI> most humble obedience, after the manner of other Christian princes. As likewise he profered vnto them both, the offices of beneuolence, charity, and true friendship, intending to ioine a firme league of amitie with them, and signifying that his dominions were free and open to all Christians, that would by sea or land frequent the same. Also he plainly seemed to de∣test the mutuall discords of Christians, exhorting them to bandy their for∣ces against the Mahumetans, and promising his roiall assistance, and most earnest endeuour, for the vanquishing of Christs enimies, and their con∣uersion to the truth. Lastly he required, that men of learning, and of skill in the holy Scriptures, as likewise diligent Printers, and all sorts of artificers might be sent him, to be emploied in the seruice of his church and com∣mon wealth. Signifying that he would not violently detaine any man in his dominions, but would dismisse him into his owne countrey, with honour, and liberall rewards. And that he might testifie his louing and kind affection to the king of Portugall, by a most woorthie monument, he sent him the crowne off his owne head, as the present of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dutifull sonne to his most deere father.</P>
<P>Wherefore by this most admirable diligence and industrie of the Portu∣gals, Ethiopia in these last times hath beene discouered and made knowne vnto vs. Neither is there any thing in the Ethiopians religion so hidden and vnreuealed, which hath not either beene found out by <HI>Francis Aluarez,</HI> or most largely declared by <HI>Zagazabo</HI> the Ethiopian ambassadour. Out of the
<PB N="400" REF="237"/>
relations therefore of these two woorthy authors, as out of a fountaine, we will deriue the whole substance of our speech.</P>
<P>The ground of the Ethiopicke religion is the profession of one true God, and of his sonne Iesus Christ, which of all Christians is the peculiar and proper marke, whereby onely they are to be named Christians. Con∣cerning this maine point the Ethiopians faith stands most firme and entire: for they togither with vs do confesse and adore one God and three persons of the deitie, God the father, God the sonne begotten of his father from euerlasting, who for vs men was incarnate, died, and rose againe; and God the holy Ghost proceeding from the father and the sonne. In this article they follow the holy creed of the Apostles, and the Nicene creed. Saue that they hold that Christ descended into hell for his owne soule, and for the soule of <HI>Adam,</HI> which he receiued of the virgine <HI>Marie.</HI> For this opinion they do most stedfastly embrace; saying that it came by most ancient tra∣dition from Christ himselfe to his Apostles.</P>
<P>The old testament they so conioine with the new, as they allow and re∣ceiue both Iewish &amp; Christian ceremonies. Vpon the eight day after their birth, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Whereas the Iewes circum∣cised the males <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> they circumcise all children both male and female. And vnlesse sick∣nes vrgeth them to make the more haste, they defer the baptisme of their male children till they be fortie, and of their females, til they be eightie daies old. Circumcision (they say) they receiued from Queene <HI>Maqueda,</HI> which went to heare the wisedome of <HI>Salomon:</HI> and baptisme from Saint <HI>Philip,</HI> and from the Eunuch which <HI>Philip</HI> baptized. Yet do they stedfastly hold, that not by circumcision, but by faith in Iesus Christ they attaine vnto true felicitie. Their baptisme they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> euerie yeere: for vpon the day of the three Sages, otherwise called Epiphanie, whereon Christ was baptised in Iordan, they meet in great assemblies, and enter naked into the water; where the priest layeth his hand vpon them, dippeth them thrise, and pronounceth the words of baptisme, saying, I baptise thee in the name of the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost; adding thereto the signe of the crosse. This cu∣stome receiued from their predecessors they doe most carefully obserue, not thereby to abase or extenuate their first baptisme; but that euerie yeere they may receiue a new absolution from their sinnes. Also vnto their in∣fants vpon the verie day of their baptisme, they giue the bodie of our Lord, vnder a small morsell of bread. But such as are growen to yeeres of discre∣tion before they come vnto the Lords holy supper, do make confession and receiue absolution of all their sinnes from the priest. Then doe they all be∣times in the morning both clergie and laytie receiue the whole sacrament of the bodie and true blood of Iesus Christ in their churches. Which being receiued, they may not vnder paine of grieuous punishment, so much as once spit, till the going downe of the sunne.</P>
<P>Popish confirmation and vnction, they neither esteeme for sacraments nor vse them. The Pope of Rome, either in regard of errour and ignorance, or to win his fauour, they acknowledge to be head of the church, and doe
<PB N="401" REF="237"/>
pretend a kinde of obedience to the sea of Rome. Albeit that the Pope, be∣fore the Portugals discouerie of the east Indies could neuer communicate any assistance vnto them, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Yet in the time of Pope Paule the 4. were sent cer∣taine priests with a new created Patri∣arke, and two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: who notwithstan∣ding when they went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about to bring in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> religion, and the supremacie of the Pope, were crossed by the Emperour in all their pro∣ceedings.</NOTE> nor yet since that time, by reason of the huge di∣stance almost of fifteene thousand miles. For so many miles the ambassa∣dour, which was sent out of Portugall to Ethiopia, said that he had trauai∣led. [<HI>It is nothing so long a iourney through Egypt, Troglodytica, and Barna∣gasso, but that the way through those countries is stopped by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Turkes.</HI>] Howbeit Queene <HI>Helena,</HI> and after her king <HI>Dauid,</HI> seeme onely to haue sought and desired some coniunction with the Roman church, and the Christians of Europe: to the end that with their powers and forces vnited, they might assaile and vanquish the Mahumetans, being most dead∣ly enimies to the Christian name.</P>
<P>Moreouer these Ethiopick Christians do vse to fast vpon certaine daies of the weeke till sun set: as namely vpon Wednesdaies, to renue the sadde memorie of the Iewes councell, wherein they decreed to crucifie our Re∣deemer: and vpon Fridaies, that they may with thankfull mindes acknow∣ledge his most bitter passion and death. Likewise the day of Good Fridaie, whereon our blessed Sauiour was nailed to the crosse, they celebrate with great deuotion, especially towards the euening. Vnto these they adde a Lent of fortie daies, wherein they liue onely by bread and water. The feasts both of Christ, of the virgine <HI>Marie,</HI> and of certaine Saints, they keepe ho∣lie: vpon which daies meeting in their churches three houres after sunne∣rising, they read the bookes of the Prophets, and emploie themselues in holy exercises. They sanctifie the Sabaoth in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Iewes: and keepe holy the Lords day according to the apostles institution. On both these daies they worship God by performing things holie, and eschu∣ing matters prophane. Into their churches they may not come but bare∣foote onely; neither is it there lawfull for any man to walke vp and downe, nor to talke of worldly affaires, nor to spit, nor cough.</P>
<P>The chiefe vse of the law (they say) is to shew vs our sinnes: neither do they thinke any man liuing able to performe the same, but onely Iesus Christ who fulfilled it on our behalfe. The Saints they loue indeed and reuerence, but doe not pray vnto them. Vnto the blessed virgine <HI>Marie</HI> the mother of Christ, they ascribe great honour, but neither do they adore her, nor craue assistance at her hands. They haue euery day one masse onely, and that a short one, in stead of a sacrifice: but gaines thereby they make none at all. Neither do they eleuate or holde vp the sacrament of the supper, as the masse-priests do: nor applie the same to redeeme dead mens soules from the paines of purgatorie. Howbeit, that there is a place of pur∣gatorie, they do not denie. Wherefore their dead are buried with crosses and supplications, and especially with the rehearsall of the beginning of Saint <HI>Iohns</HI> Gospell. Then the day following they offer almes for them, and vpon certaine daies after they adde funerall-banquets; supposing that vpon Sabaoths and the Lords daies, they which died godly, are freed from all
<PB N="402" REF="238"/>
torments in Purgatorie, and at length, hauing receiued the full measure of chastisement for their sinnes, that then they go into eternall rest. For the ef∣fecting whereof, they do not thinke any indulgences of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but onely the meere mercy and grace of God to be auaileable.</P>
<P>Mariage is no lesse permitted to their clergie and priests, then to their laie-people: yet so, that his first wife being dead, a priest cannot marry ano∣ther without the Patriarkes dispensation. Whosoeuer keepeth a concubine is debarred from all sacred administrations. And whatsoeuer bishop or cler∣gie-man is found to haue a bastard, he is vtterly depriued of holy orders, and of all his benefices and spirituall dignities. Mariages are often solemnized without the church, a bed being placed before the house of the bride and the bridegroome. Then come three priests, who going thrise about the bridegromes bed, sing with a loud voice Halleluiah, and other things. This done, they cut one locke of haire from the bridegroomes head, and another from the head of the bride, which they wash in wine made of hony; and then putting vpon either of their heads the others lock, they sprinkle them with a kinde of holy-water, and so depart. Which being performed, the mariage∣feast beginneth, and holdeth on till the night be far spent. At length the bride and bridegroom are brought vnto their owne house, out of which nei∣ther of them may go forth for the space of an whole moneth after.</P>
<P>In some places they are maried in the church by the patriarke himselfe. Where the mariage-bed standing in manner aforesaid, the patriarke with sweet incense and crosses walketh thrise about it, and then turning himselfe towards them, he layeth his hand vpon the bridegroomes head, saying: <HI>Do that which god hath commanded in his gospel, and thinke now that you are not two but one flesh.</HI> Hauing spoken these words, he administreth the commu∣nion vnto them, and blesseth them. Polygamie, or many wiues at once, are permitted by the emperour and ciuill magistrate vnto the Ethiopians: but in their churches there is no place at all for such as haue more wiues then one. Neither may any such persons presume to enter into their churches, but are held as excommunicate, and are not receiued into the congregati∣on, before hauing put away all the residue of their wiues, they betake them∣selues to one onely.</P>
<P>Diuorcements they vse very commonlie, and often vpon light occasions except onely the priests, who may by no meanes depart from their wiues. Whereby it appeareth, that their priests approue not that inconstancie in a matter of so great moment. The best remedy which they haue to preuent this mischiefe, is at the daye of mariage to alotte some great penalty vpon that person which shall first forsake the other. Amongst them likewise, ac∣cording to the law of Moses, brothers vse to marry their brothers wiues, to raise vp seede vnto them. Howbeit this abuse of mariage is not practised by all, but onely by the mightier sort. For the country-people and those of poorer condition, being euery one contented with his owne wife, do so painefully employ themselues about their labour, and the getting of their
<PB N="403" REF="238"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that they are free from those violent passions of lust.</P>
<P>Infants that die before baptisme they name halfe christians, because, be∣ing sanctified onely by the faith of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parents, they are not as yet by baptisme throughly engraffed into the church. From meates, which the law of Moses accounted vncleane, they also do abstaine. The heresies of Ar∣rius, Macedonius, and Nestorius, they reiect and condemne.</P>
<P>The whole church of Ethiopia is gouerned by a patriark called in the E∣thiopick language <HI>Abuna,</HI> which signifieth, A Father. This patriark of theirs is first solemnely created at Ierurasem by the voices of those monkes which keepe the sepulchre of our Lord. Afterward hee is confirmed, and sent into Ethiopia by the patriarke of Alexandria. The emperour <HI>Prete Ianni,</HI> so of∣ten as there is need of a new patriark, sendeth an ambassage with many gifts to Ierusalem, and requireth a patriark from thence. Which patriarke, together with a monke of the order of Saint <HI>Antony</HI> the Hermite, being come into Ethiopia, is, according to an ancient custome, receiued with the generall consent, congratulation, applause, and reioycing of all degrees and estates of people. To this high function is singled out some one man of sin∣gular piety, grauity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and of more ancient yeeres then the rest. His speciall duties are to giue holy orders, to administer church-discipline, and to excommunicate contumaces or obstinate offenders, which are for their stubbornnes famished to death. But the authoritie of giuing Bishopricks and spirituall benefices, the Emperour reserueth to himselfe. In Ethiopia there are infinit numbers of priests, and of monkes. <HI>Francis Aluarez</HI> saw at one time ordained by the Patriarke two thousand three hundred fiftie sixe priests. And the like manner of ordaining or instalment they haue euerie yeere twise. It seemeth that those which are chosen into that order, are men destitute of learning and liberall artes. Vnto their priesthood none is admitted before he be full thirtie yeeres of age. It falleth out likewise, that during the vacation of the Patriarkship, the church hath great want of priests. Which vacation is often times prolonged by reason of the continu∣all wars betweene the Christians and the bordering Mahumetans, and Gen∣tiles: whereby all passage from Ethiopia to the monks of Ierusalem is quite cut off. Hence proceedeth great desolation in that church. But with monks all places in this Abassin empire do mightily swarme. These do not onely confine themselues in monasteries, wherof here are great numbers, but also take vpon them offices in the court, and intangle themselues in militarie affaires, and in buying and selling of merchandize. Neither are there anie kinde of people in those easterne parts more conuersant in trade of mer∣chandize then priests <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> monkes. So that the old said sawe is most truelie verified:</P>
<Q><L>What ere the world doth put in vre,</L>
<L>The Monke will intermeddle, sure.</L></Q>
<P>It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be noted, that the priests, monkes, and other ministers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ethiopian church, are not maintained by tithes and almes as they are in
<PB N="404" REF="239"/>
Europe. They haue onelie certaine fieldes and gardens, which must be ma∣nured by the monkes and clergie themselues. To beg ought of the common people they are in no wise permitted, vnlesse perhaps some man will of his owne accorde bestowe somewhat in their churches for the exequies of the dead, or for some other sacred vses.</P>
<P>These Ethiopians haue a certaine booke, which they suppose to haue beene written by all the Apostles when they were assembled at Ierusalem. This booke in their language they call Manda and Abetilis: and do beleeue that all thinges therein contained are to be holden for gospel. In it, amongst other matters, are contained certaine penal statutes; as for example. If a priest be conuicted of Adultery, Man-slaughter, Robberie, or periurie, he is to receiue like punishment with other malefactors. Likewise, that aswell ecclesiasticall, as secular persons, are to abstaine from comming to church for the space of fower and twentie howers after carnall copulation. Some lawes also there are, concerning the purification of women after their mo∣neths, and their child-birth: which, bicause we can make but little vse of them, I do heere passe ouer in silence. One thing there is in this booke very well prouided, namely, that twise euery yeere there be a Synod assembled in the church of Christ, for the handling and discussing of all matters ecclesi∣asticall.</P>
<P>These are the principall points of the religion, faith, and ceremonies of the Ethiopicke church vnder <HI>Prete Ianni,</HI> which hitherto haue come to our knowledge. A good part whereofis agreeable vnto the scriptures of the old and new testament. And such in very deed they are, as represent vnto vs the acknowledgement of one true God, and the faith and worship of our onely Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ. But as neuer any church vpon earth was quite voide of blemish: so neither is this of Ethiopia free from all staines of errour. Which notwithstanding may seeme the lesse strange, bicause in Ethiopia there are no schooles nor Seminaries of liberall artes, saue only, that the priests themselues (according to their simple skill) traine vp their sonnes vnto such learning, as may in time make them capable of priesthood. Neither was there euer any man yet, that reformed their errors. <HI>Francis Aluarez</HI> reporteth, that the Patriarke of this Ethiopick church, in a certaine priuate conference, did grieuously complaine of all such errours as were there maintained, and was most earnestly desirous of a reformation. Which desire of his, as it is most holy &amp; cōmendable; so is it by al christiās to be approoued. God almightie grant, that the Ethiopians may one daie attaine to the accomplishment of this his compassionate well-wishing, and may haue a happie reformation of their church. For this to desire and praie for, is farre more conuenient and Christian-like, then to disgrace them with reprochfull words, and to bereaue them of the name of Christians. Which harde and vnchristian measure, <HI>Zagazabo</HI> the Ethiopian ambassadour, re∣porteth with griefe, that he found among the Popish priests of Portugall; by whom he was quite restrained from the vse and communion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="405" REF="239"/>
supper, as ifhe had beene a meere Gentile, or Anathema.</P>
<P>It is indeed an errour, or rather a great infirmitie, that they do as yet re∣taine and vse some of the Iewish ceremonies. But we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to impute it to their ignorance of Christian liberty. And wheras they permit mariage to their priests, it is neither repugnant to the sacred word of God, nor to the institution of the Apostles. Wherefore it ought not to be disallowed of any Christians. Vnlesse they will preferre the decrees of the Pope before the commandement of God, established by Christ and his apostles. Wher∣by it may plainly appeere how impiously and sauagely the Priests of Portu∣gall dealt, in that especially for this cause they so sharpely inneied against the Ethiopick ambassadour, and so vnciuilly entreated him.</P>
<P>Their yeerely renewing ofbaptisme, was at the first brought in by errour, and since by ancient vse and tradition, hath growen authenticall. For in very deed so great is the force of antiquitie and custome, that where they once take roote, they can hardly be remooued. And it is a woonder that the Ethi∣opians do so often repeat baptisme, when as they cannot be circumcised any more then once. But in regard of all these defects, what can we better de∣uise to do, then in our daily praiers to wish them mindes better informed, and the puritie and integritie of faith, which is agreeable vnto gods worde? The Ethiopians conceiued exceeding ioy at the first arriuall of the Portu∣gals in their countrie: hoping that their mutuall acquaintance and familia∣ritie, would breed a similitude and coniunction, as well of their religions, as of their affections and mindes. But I am verily afraid, least the reproch∣full and sterne carriage of the Popish priests and monkes towards the Ethi∣opick ambassadours before mentioned, hath more then euer in times past estranged the mindes of that nation from the Christians of Europe.</P>
<P>Howbeit the singular care and industrie of those two renowmed Princes, <HI>Iohn</HI> the second, and <HI>Emanuel,</HI> kings of Portugall, is most highly to be ex∣tolled and celebrated, who by infinit charges emploied vpon their nauiga∣tions to The east Indies, and to these parts; haue opened a way for the Eu∣ropean Christians, to the southerne church of Ethiopia; and for the Ethio∣pians to this westerne church of Europe. Which had not these two woor∣thie Princes brought to effect, we should not so much as haue knowne the name of a Christian church in Ethiopia. For thither by the way of Arabia and Egypt, in regard of the Arabians and Mahumetans most deadly enmi∣tie to the Christian faith, it is so dangerous and difficult to trauell, as it see∣meth to be quite barred and shut vp. Vnlesse therefore ouer the Atlantike Ethiopick, and Indian seas the Portugals had thither found a passage by na∣uigation; it had almost beene impossible for any ambassadours or other persons, to haue come out of Ethiopia into these westerne parts.

<HEAD>An ambassage sent from Pope <HI>Paule</HI> the fourth <HI>to</HI> Claudius <HI>the Emperour of Abassia or the higher</HI> Ethiopia, for planting of the religion and ceremonies of the <HI>church of Rome in his dominions; which ambassage tooke none effect at all.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the yeere 1555 <HI>Iohn</HI> the third king of Portugal, de∣termined to leaue no meanes vnattempted for the ab∣solute reconciliation of <HI>Prete Ianni</HI> vnto the church of Rome. For though <HI>Dauids</HI> ambassador had perfor∣med obedience to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the seuenth on his emperours behalfe; yet doubted the king of Portugal (as true it was) that for want of speedie prosecution, those forward beginnings would proue but altogether fruitlesse; in that for all this, they still embraced the heresies of Dioscorus and Eutiches, and de∣pended on the authoritie of the Patriark of Alexandria, receiuing their Abuna from him, who is the sole arbitrator of all their matters ecclesiasti∣call, the administrer of their sacraments, the giuer of orders ouer all Ethio∣pia, master of their ceremonies, and Instructer of their faith. Whereupon he supposed, that he could not do any thing more profitable, or necessarie, then to send thither a Patriark appointed at Rome, who might exercise spi∣rituall authority ouer them, as also with him some priests, of singular inte∣grity and learning, who with their sermons, disputations, &amp; discourses both publike and priuate, might reduce those people from their errors and here∣sies to the trueth, and might confirme and strengthen them in the same. And vnto this, it seemed a wide gate was already open; because not many yeeres before, <HI>Claudius</HI> the emperour of Ethiopia receiued great succours from the Portugals, against Graadamet king of Zeila, who had brought him to an hard point; and in a letter written from him to <HI>Stephen Gama,</HI> he called <HI>Christopher Gama</HI> his brother, who died in this war, by the reuerend name of a Martyr. The king of Portugal therefore hauing imparted this his resolution, first with Pope <HI>Iulius</HI> the third, and then with <HI>Paul</HI> the fourth, it was by them concluded to send into Ethiopia thirteene priests, men of principall estimation and account aboue others of their qualitie. <HI>Iohn Nun∣nes</HI> Barretto was made Patriark, and there were ioyned vnto him two assi∣sting Bishops, <HI>Melchior Carnero,</HI> and <HI>Andrea Oiuedo,</HI> vnder title of the Bi∣shops of Nicea, and Hierapolis. King <HI>Iohn</HI> set forth this ambassage, not onely with whatsoeuer the voiage it selfe necessarily required, but further with all royall preparation, and rich presents for <HI>Prete Ianni.</HI> Neuerthelesse, the better to lay open an entrance for the Patriarke, there was by the kings appointment sent before from the city of Goa, Iago Dias, and with him
<PB N="407" REF="240"/>
<HI>Gonsaluo Rodrigo,</HI> into Ethiopia, to discouer the minde of the Neguz, and the disposition of his people. These two being admitted to the presence of that Prince, shewed him the letters of king <HI>Iohn,</HI> wherein he congratulated with him, on the behalfe of all Christians; for that following the example of his grandfather, and father, he had embraced the Christian faith, and vnion. Whereat <HI>Claudius</HI> was amazed, 'as at a thing neuer before thought of. And<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emperour of Ethiopia wil by no meanes admit the su∣premacie and religion of the Romish church.</NOTE> it being demaunded, why he had written to the king of Portugal to that ef∣fect, he excused himselfe by the writer, and interpreter of his letter: adding thereunto, that though hee esteemed that king as his very good brother, yet was he neuer minded to swerue one iot from the faith of his predecessors. <HI>Roderigo</HI> for all this, was no whit daunted, but wrought all meanes to bring <HI>Claudius</HI> to his opinion. But the greatest difficultie against this his busie enterprise, was the ignorance of the emperour and the princes of Ethio∣pia in all the generall Councels, and ancient Histories. Afterwards percei∣uing that the Neguz did not willingly admit him to audience, he wrote and diuulged a booke in the Chaldean toong; wherein confuting the opinions of the the Abassins, he laboured mightily to aduance the authoritie of the Romaine church.

And hauing made knowne in Goa, how matters stood, it was not thought requisite that the Patriarke should expose his owne person, togither with the reputation of the Romaine church, vnto so great hazard. But rather, not wholy to aban∣don the enterprise, they determined to send thither <HI>Andrew Ouiedo,</HI> (newe elect bishop of Hierapolis) with two or three assistants, who with greater authoritie might debate of that which <HI>Roderigo</HI> alreadie had so vnfruitfully treated of. <HI>Ouiedo</HI> most willingly vndertaking this attempt, put himselfe on the voiage, with father <HI>Emanuel Fernandez,</HI> and some fewe others. When he was come into Abassia, he stood in more need of patience then disputati∣on. For king <HI>Claudius</HI> within a fewe moneths after, being vanquished and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adamas a new Emperour of Ethiopia.</NOTE> slaine, <HI>Adamas</HI> his brother succeeded, who was a great enimie to the sea of Rome.

<P>VIcinitie of place and conformitie of customes inuite me to crosse the sea, and to visite the Christians of Socotera. This island is sixtie miles long, and fiue and twentie in bredth. It is situate ouer against the Red sea. The people thereof receiued the faith from Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle: for they affirme, that heere he suf∣fred shipwracke, and that of the broken and battered ship he built a church, which is as yet extant. They imitate for the most part the rites, customes, and fashions of the Abassins, but with great ignorance and errour: for being separated from all commerce with the Christians of these parts, they re∣maine depriued of that spirituall helpe, which the westerne church by com∣munication might impart vnto them. They retaine circumcision, and some other Moisaicall ceremonies. Also they pray for the dead, and obserue or∣dinarie fasts: hauing prefixed howers for praier, and bearing great reue∣rence to their religion, in honour whereof, they build chappels, wherein as∣sembling togither, with an high and loude voice, they make supplications and praiers in the Hebrew toong. But their farre distance (as I said) from these parts of Christendome, the sterilitie of the island, and the pouertie of the people, are occasions that the little light of truth which they haue, is in a manner quite eclipsed by multitudes of errors.

<HEAD>Of the Christians in the king dome of Congo.</HEAD>
<P>HItherto we haue described that little, which remaineth of the ancient Christianity of Africk. It now resteth, that we giue some notice of that, which hath beene brought in of late. Congo is a kingdome about the bignes of France, situate (as is before said) beyond the equinocti∣all betweene Cabo da Catherina, and Bahia das vacas. It was conuerted to Christian religion, by the meanes of <HI>Don Iohn</HI> the second king of Portugal, in manner following. <HI>Don Diego Cano</HI> a captaine of that king, by his com∣mission coasting along Africa, after a great nauigation, arriued at length in the great riuer of Zaire; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to saile vp into it, he discouered a∣long the banks thereof many townes, where he found much more affability in the inhabitants, then in those of other countries which before he had dis∣couered. And that he might be able to giue the more faithfull aduertise∣ment thereof to his king, his hart moued him to go to the court of that kingdome. Whither bein̄g come, and courteously brought to the kings presence, he shewed them the vanity of their Idolatry, &amp; the high reuerence of christian faith. And he found in that Prince so good a disposition, as re∣turning into Portugal, besides an ambassador he was permitted to carry with him certaine youths of noble parentage, to the end they might learne the Christian doctrine, and be well instructed therein; and being baptized also, might afterwards be sent back with Portugall priests to preache the gospel, and to plant the Christian faith in that kingdome. These youthes remained in Portugal two yeeres, and were there liberally entertained, and with all di∣ligence instructed in matters of religion, and were at length with great so∣lemnity baptized. When they came to riper yeeres, king <HI>Iohn</HI> sent them backe againe into their owne countrey, with an honorable ambassage,
<PB N="410" REF="242"/>
in whose company went for teachers and instructers of that nation three Dominick-Fryers, reputed for men of exquisit learning and holy life. Be∣ing arriued in Congo, they first cōuerted <HI>Mani-Sogno</HI> the kings vncle, with one of his sonnes. After that ensued the baptisme of the king and Queene; for which cause in short time, there was a goodly Church erected, vnder the name and title of <HI>Santa Cruz.</HI> And in the meane while there were infinit Idols burnt. The king was called <HI>Iohn,</HI> the Queene <HI>Leonora,</HI> and his eldest sonne <HI>Alonso.</HI> This <HI>Alonso</HI> was a singular good man, who not being satis∣fied in his owne conuersion, laboured also with a kind of Apostolicall zeale for the conuersion of his subiects. But let no man thinke, that the planting of religion can euer passe without some labour and trouble. These Do∣minick-Fryers, besides the intemperature of the aire and vnusuall heat, which consumed them, were also euilly entreated by the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">So are the in∣habitants of Congo called.</NOTE> Moci-Con∣gi. For although they shewed themselues docible, and tractable enough, while they were instructed onely about ceremonies, and diuine mysteries, (because they thought, that the higher those matters were aboue humaine capacity, the more they sorted and were agreable to the maiestie of God) neuerthelesse when they began to entreate seriously of Temperance, conti∣nence, restitution of other mens goods, forgiuing of iniuries, and other heades of Christian pietie, they found not onely great hinderance and dif∣ficultie, but euen plaine resistance and opposition. The king himselfe, who had from the beginning shewed notable zeale, was now somewhat cooled; who because he was loth to abandon his soothsaiers and fortune tellers, but aboue all, the multitude of his concubines (this being a generall difficultie among the Barbarians) would by no meanes giue eare vnto the Preachers. Also the women (who were now reiected one after another) not enduring so suddenly to be banished from their husbandes, brought the court and roiall citie of Saint Saluador into a great vproare. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">So called by Osorius lib. 3. de Reb.

God fauoured <HI>Alonso</HI> in this warre, with manifest miracles. For first they affirme, that be∣ing readie to enter into battaile, he saw a light so cleere and resplendent, that he and his companie which beheld it, remained for a good while with their eies declined, and their mindes so full and replenished with ioy and a kind of tender affection, that cannot easily be expressed. And then lifting vp their eies vnto heauen, they sawe fiue shining swords, which the king tooke afterwards for his armes, and his successors vse the same at this day.</P>
<P>Hauing obteined this victorie, he assembled all his nobles, and streightly
<PB N="411" REF="242"/>
enioined them to bring all the idols of his countrey to an appointed place, and so vpon an high hill, he caused them all to be burned. This <HI>Alonso</HI> raig∣ned prosperously for fiftie yeeres togither, in which space he exceedingly furthered by authoritie and example, as also by preaching and doctrine, the new-planted Christianitie. Neither did <HI>Don Emanuell</HI> the King of Portu∣gall giue ouer this enterprise: for he sent from thence to Congo, twelue of those Fryers which the Portugals call Azzurri, of whom Fryer <HI>Iohn Mari∣ano</HI> was head: with architects and smiths for the building and seruice of Churches, and with rich furniture for the same. After king <HI>Alonso,</HI> succeeded <HI>Don Pedro</HI> his sonne: in whose time there was a Bishop appointed ouer the isle of Saint Thomas, who had also committed vnto him the administration of Congo. Where, at the citie of Saint Saluador, was instituted a colledge of eight and twentie Canons in the Church of Santa Cruz. The second bishop was of the bloud roiall of Congo, who trauailed to Rome, and died in his returne homeward. <HI>Don Francisco</HI> succeeded <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> who conti∣nued but a small space: &amp; <HI>Don Diego</HI> his neere kinsman was after his decease aduanced to the crowne. In whose time <HI>Iohn</HI> the third king of Portugall, vn∣derstanding that neither the king himselfe cared greatly for religion, and that the merchants and priests of Europe furthered not, but rather with their bad life scandalized the people new conuerted, he sent thither fower Iesuits, to renew and reestablish matters of religion. These men arriuing first at the isle of Saint Thomas, and then at Congo, were courteously recei∣ued by the king: and presently going about the busines they came for, one of them tooke vpon him to teach sixe hundred yoong children, the principles of christian religion: and the other dispersed themselues ouer the whole countrie to preach. But all of them, one after another, falling into tedious and long diseases, they were enforced to returne into Europe. At this time there was appointed ouer Congo a third bishop of the Portugall nation, who through the contumacie of the Canons and clergie, found trouble enough. In the meane while <HI>Don Diego</HI> dying, there arose great tumults touching the succession, by meanes whereof, all the Portugals in a manner, that were in Saint Saluador (except priests) were slaine. In the end, <HI>Henrie</HI> brother to <HI>Don Diego</HI> obteined the crowne, and after him (for he quicklie died in the warres of the Anzichi) <HI>Don Aluaro</HI> his son in law. This man re∣conciled vnto himselfe the Portugall nation, caused all the religious and lay sort dispersed heere and there, throughout the kingdome, to be gathered togither, and wrote for his discharge to the king, and to the Bishop of Saint Thomas. The bishop hauing perused the letters, passed himselfe in∣to Congo: and giuing some order for the discipline of the clergie, he retur∣ned to Saint Thomas, where hee ended his daies. It so fell out, that what for the absence, and what for the want of Bishoppes, the progres∣sion of religion was much hindred. For one <HI>Don Francisco,</HI> a man for<NOTE PLACE="marg">* Called by Philippo Pi∣gafetto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> bloud and wealth of no small authoritie, began freely to say, that it was a vaine thing to cleaue to one wife onely, and afterwardes in the end, he fell
<PB N="412" REF="243"/>
altogither from the faith, and was an occasion that the king grew woonder∣fully cold. They affirme, that this <HI>Francisco</HI> dying, and being buried in the church of Santa Cruz, the diuels vncouered a part of that churches roofe, and with terrible noise drew his dead carcase out of the tombe, and carried it quite away: a matter that made the king exceedingly amazed: but yet ano∣ther accident that ensued withall, strooke him neerer to the hart: For the Giacchi leauing their owne habitations, entred like Locusts into the king∣dome<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning these Giacchi, otherwise cal∣led Agag, read the discourse of Mohenemugi before the be∣ginning of Iohn Leo.</NOTE> of Congo, and comming to battaile against <HI>Don Aluaro</HI> the king, put him to flight: who not being secure in the head citie, abandoned his king∣dome, and togither with the Portugall priests, and his owne princes, retired himselfe vnto an island of the riuer Zaire, called The isle of horses. Thus seeing himselfe brought to such extremitie (for besides the losse of his king∣dome, his people died of famine and miserie, and for maintenance of life sold themselues one to another, and to the Portugals also at a base price) for reparation of his state and religion, he had recourse to <HI>Don Sebastian</HI> king of Portugall, and obteined of him sixe hundred soldiers, by whose va∣lour he draue his enimies out of the kingdome, and within a yeere and an halfe, reestablished himselfe in his throne. In his time <HI>Antonio di Glioun</HI> à Spaniard, was made bishop of Saint Thomas, who after much molestation procured him by the captaine of that island, went at length into Congo, with two friers and fower priests, and ordered matters reasonablie well. In the meane while <HI>Don Aluaro</HI> died, and his sonne of the same name succee∣ded him, who failed not to sollicite, both <HI>Don Sebastian</HI> and <HI>Don Henrie</HI> kings of Portugall, and the king of Spaine also, that they would send him some competent number of preachers and ecclesiasticall persons for the augmentation of the Christian faith in his kingdome: and amidst these de∣terminations he died, and a sonne of his called also <HI>Don Aluaro</HI> succeeded him.</P>
<P>During these tumults, certaine other Portugall Priests went into Con∣go, labouring to prune that vine which had beene long time giuen ouer, and forsaken. These men haue built them an house in the island of Loanda, where do remaine sixe or seauen of their companie, that are readie to goe sometimes hither, and sometimes thither, as neede requireth. In the yeere of our Lord 1587. king Aluaro, (who bicause hee was not borne of law∣full matrimonie, was but little esteemed by his people) would needes haue one of these priests about him, by whose meanes and authoritie he came to reputation and credite. And God himselfe fauoured his procee∣dings: for meeting a sister of his by the fathers side, and one of her bro∣thers, with a great armie in the fielde, he gaue him battaile, and bore him∣selfe therein with such valour, as he did not onely ouerthrow the forces of his enime but further slew the ring-leader and generall thereof, and in the place where he was slaine, he would needs build a church to the honour of Christianitie. And the more by his owne example to mooue others, him∣selfe was the very first man that put hand to this worke: and likewise with

edicts and fauourable proclamations, he furthered and doth still aduance the preaching of the Gospell, and the propagation of religion.</P>

<P>THose Portugal priests that remaine in the Iland Loanda, as aboue we declared, bend themselues more to the conuersion of Angola, then of Congo. The reason is (as I suppose) be∣cause the enterprise is new, and more neerely concerneth the Portugals, who there make war vnder the conduct of <HI>Paulo Diaz,</HI> to get possession of the mountaines of Cabambe which abound with rich mines of very fine siluer. It seemeth that god hath fauoured the amplifi∣cation of his holy name in those parts with some myraculous victories. For first in the yeere 1582, a fewe Portugals in an excursion that they made, put to flight an innumerable companie of the Angolans. And by this victory, they brought in a manner the halfe of that kingdome into their handes: and many Princes and nobles of the land vpon this, were moued to request and make suit to be baptized. Among whom was <HI>Songa</HI> prince of Banza, the kinges Father in law, whose brother and children were baptized already. <HI>Tondella</HI> also, the second person of Angola was conuerted: many Idols were throwne to the ground, and insteede thereof they erected crosses, and built some churches. And within this little while all the Prouince of Corimba is in a manner conuerted. Also in the yeere 1584, an hundred and fiftie Por∣tugals, together with such succors as were conducted by <HI>Paule</HI> Prince of Angola, who was not long before conuerted; discomfited more then a mil∣lion of Ethiopians. In an other place we declared the readie meanes and oportunities that the Princes of Ethiopia and of India haue, to assemble and bring togither such infinite armies. They say, that certaine Ethiopians be∣ing demaunded by a Portugal, how it came to passe that so great a multitude turned their backes to so few men: they answered, that the Portugals strength did it not, which with a blast they would haue confounded, but a woman of incomparable beawty, apparelled in shining light and brightnes, and an old man that kept her company with a flaming sword in his hand, who went aloft in the ayre before the Portugals, and ouerthrew the squa∣drons of the Angolans, putting them to flight and destruction.

<HEAD>The Christian religion of Monomotapa.</HEAD>
<P>IN the dominions of the Monomotapa, the light of the faith being with incredible ease kindled, was also as suddenly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the deuises of the Mahumetans. For some Portugals going to the court of that monarche, and giuing himselfe, with some of his Princes and vassals, a taste of the gospel, were an occasion afterwards that <HI>Gonsaluo de Sylua,</HI> a man no lesse fa∣mous for the integrity of his life, then for his bloud and parentage, went ouer thither from Goa in the yeere 1570. This man arriuing with a prospe∣rous voiage, in the kingdome of Inambane, conuerted and baptized the king, his wife, children, and sister, with his Barons and nobility, and the greatest part of his people. Through whose perswasion <HI>Gonsaluo</HI> left his compa∣nions, prosecuting his voiage towards the Monomotapa, onely with sixe Portugals. Thus hauing passed Mozambique, and the mouth of the riuer Mafuta, and of Colimane, they came to Mengoaxano king of Quiloa, where they were courteously receiued&amp; entertained. And though they had licence in this place to preach the gospell, yet would not <HI>Gonsaluo</HI> here stay, iudging that vpon the cōuersion of the Monomotapa, that of the neighbor kings would follow without delaie. Embarking themselues therefore vp∣on the riuer Cuama, they sailed along the coast of Africa eight daies, till they came to Sena, a very populous village: where <HI>Gonsaluo</HI> baptized about fiue hundred slaues, belonging to the Portugal merchants, and prepared for the receiuing of the gospel the king of Inamor, one of the Monomotapaes vassals. In the ende <HI>Antonio Caiado</HI> a Portugall gentleman came from the court, to guide <HI>Gonsaluo</HI> towardes the same place. Whither being in short time come, he was presently visited on the emperours behalfe, and bounti∣fullie presented with a great summe of gold, and many oxen. But he retur∣ning back these presents, gaue the Monomotapa to vnderstand, that he should know of <HI>Caiado,</HI> what he desired. The emperour was astonished at this his magnanimity, &amp; receiued him afterwards with the greatest honor, that could possibly be deuised. And causing him to sit vpon the same carpet, whereon also his owne mother sate, he presently demaunded how many wo∣men, how much ground, and how many oxen (thinges mightily esteemed of in those countries) he would haue. <HI>Gonsaluo</HI> answered, that he would haue no other thing but himselfe. Whereupon the emperour turning to <HI>Caiado</HI> (who was their interpreter) said; that surely it could not be otherwise, but that he, who made so little account of thinges so highly valued by others, was no ordinary man; and so with much courtesie he sent him back to his lodging.</P>
<P>Not long time after, the emperour let <HI>Gonsaluo</HI> to vnderstand, that he and his mother were resolued to become Christians, and that therefore he should come to baptize them. But he to instruct them better in the faith,
<PB N="415" REF="244"/>
deferred it off for some daies. Finally fiue and twentie daies after his arri∣uall, with vnspeakeable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and preparation, he gaue the water of baptisme to the king, and to his mother. He was called <HI>Sebastian,</HI> and shee <HI>Maria.</HI> And presently after, about three hundred of the principall in this emperours court were baptized. <HI>Gonsaluo</HI> for his wonderfull abstinence, charity, wisedome, and for many other his singular vertues was so reueren∣ced and esteemed by those people, as if he had come downe from heauen among them. Now as matters proceeded thus prosperously, and with so de∣sireable successe, behold, an horrible tempest arose which drowned the ship. There were in the court fower Mahumetans most deere vnto the king. These men finding out some occasion, suggested vnto him, that <HI>Gonsaluo</HI> was a Magioian, who by witchcraftes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could turne king∣domes topsie turuie: and that he was come to prie into his estate, and to stir vp his people to rebellion, and so by this meanes to bring his kingdome vn∣der subiection to the Portugals. With these and such like suggestions they brought the king (who was but a young man) to determine the death of <HI>Gonsaluo.</HI> The effect whereof was, that after long praier, reposing himselfe a little; he was by eight of the kings seruants slaine, and his body throwne into the riuer Mensigine. Neere vnto the same place, were with like violence put to death, fiftie new-conuerted Christians. This rage and furie being ouer, the king was aduertised by the Principall of his kingdome, and then by the Portugals, of the excesse and outrage he had therein committed. He excu∣sed himselfe the best he could, causing those Mahumetans to be slaine, who had seduced him; and he sought out some others also who lay hid, to put them to death. Whereupon it seemed that by the death of father <HI>Gonsaluo,</HI> the conuersion of this great king, and of his empire, should haue bin furthe∣red, and no whit hindered, if the Portugals would rather haue preuailed by the word of God, then by force of armes. The which I say, bicause insteed of sending new preachers into those countries, to preserue that which was alreadie gotten, and to make new conuersions, they resolued to reuenge themselues by warre. There departed therefore out of Portugall a good fleete, with a great number of noble Portugals therein, conducted by <HI>Fran∣cisco Barretto.</HI> At the fame of this warre, mooued against him, the Mono∣motapa full of feare, sent to demaund peace of <HI>Barretto.</HI> But he aspiring to the infinite mines of gold in that kingdome, contemned all conditions of∣fered him. The effect of this enterprise was, that this armie which was so terrible to a mightie Monarke, was in fewe daies consumed by the intempe∣rature of the aire, which is there insupportable to the people of Europe.</P>

<PB N="417" REF="245"/>
best manured islands that is knowne. There is in the same, the citie of Funcial, being the seate of a bishop. Puerto santo, which is fortie miles di∣stant from Madera, was found out in the yeere 1428. and this also began presently to be inhabited. The isles of Arguin, being sixe or seauen, and all but little ones, came to the knowledge of the Portugals in the yeere 1443. Heere the king hath a fortresse for the traffike of those countries. The islands of Cabo Verde were discouered in the yeere 1440. by <HI>Antonio di Nolli</HI> a Genoway, or (as others affirme) in the yeere 1455. by <HI>Aloizius Cadamosto.</HI> These be nine in number: the principall of them is Sant Iago, being seuentie miles in length: where the Portugals haue a towne situate vpon a most pleasant riuer, called Ribera grande, which consisteth at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> least of fiue hundred families. The isle of Saint Thomas being somewhat greater then Madera, was the last island discouered by the Portugals, before they doubled the cape De buena Esperança. They haue heere a colonie called Pouasaon, with a bishop, who is also the bishop of Congo, and it conteineth seuen hundred families. Vnder the gouernment of Saint Tho∣mas are the neighbour islands of Fernando Pó, and that del Principe, which are as it were boroughs belonging to the same. The island Loanda, though it be vnder the king of Congo, yet is a great part thereof inhabited by the Portugals. For heere is the famous port of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Not Maza∣gan vpon the coast of Bar∣barie.</NOTE> Mazagan, whither the ships of Portugall and Brasile do resort. Heere the fleetes are harboured, and the soldiers refreshed, and heere they haue their hospitall. As also heere the Portugall priests (who indeuour the conuersion of the naturall inhabitants) haue a place of residence.</P>

<P>MOst of the Islands inhabited by the Portugals, especi∣ally those of Saint Thomas and Madera, besides the Portugals themselues, containe a great multitude of Negro-slaues, brought thither out of Congo and An∣gola, who till the earth, water the sugar-canes, and serue both in the cities, and in the countrie. These are for the most part gentiles, but they are daily conuerted rather through continual conuersation, then any other helpe that they haue; and it is a matter likelie, that in processe of some few yeeres, they will all become Christians. There is no greater hinderance to their conuersion, then the auarice of their masters, who, to hold them in the more subiection, are not willing that they should become Christians.</P>

<HEAD>Of those poore distressed European Christians in Africa, who are holden as slaues vnto the Turkes and Mores.</HEAD>
<P>BVt the best and most sincere christianity in all Africa, is that of those poore christians, who are fettered by the feet with chaines, being slaues to the Arabians &amp; Turkes. For besides them that haue remained there
<PB N="418" REF="246"/>
euer since the daies of Barbarossa and other Turkish captaines (which were brought into the mediterran seas by the French) as also since the great losse at Gerbi, and the battell of Alcazar wherein <HI>Don Sebastian</HI> the king of Por∣tugal was ouerthrowne: there passeth not a yeere, but the rouers and pirates of those parts, without graunting any league or respite to the Northren shore of the Mediterran sea, take great numbers of Christians from off the coasts of Spaine, Sardinia, Corsica, Sicilia, yea euen from the very mouth of Tyber. It is generallie thought, that the number of slaues, which are in Al∣ger amount to eighteene thousand. In Tunis, Bona, and Biserta there are great multitudes: but many more in Fez, and Maroco; as likewise in Meque∣nez and Tarodant, and in diuers other cities of those kingdomes. The estate surely of these distressed people is most woorthie of compassion, not so much for the miserie wherein they lead their liues, as for the danger where∣to their soules are subiect. They passe the day in continuall trauaile, and the greatest part of the night without repose or quiet, vnder insupportable bur∣dens, and cruell stripes. Beasts among vs labour not more, nor are more slauishly intreated. Yea, albeit vnder those brutish Barbarians, they endure all that toile, which beasts do heere with vs: yet are they neither so well fed, nor so carefully looked vnto, as our beasts commonly are. They weare out the whole day in the sunne, raine, and winde, in continuall labour, sometimes carrying burdens, sometimes digging or ploughing the fields, and other∣whiles in turning of hand-milles, feeding of beasts, or in performance of other labours: being bound to bring in so much euery day to their masters, and they themselues to liue of the rest, which many times is nothing at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or (if it were possible) lesse then nothing. They haue alwaies the chaine at their neckes and feete, being naked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and sommer, and therefore are sometimes scorched with heate, and otherwhiles frozen with cold. They must not faile in any iotte of their duties, and yet though they do not, it can not be expressed with what cruelties they are tormented. They vse for the chastizing &amp; torture of their bodies, chaines of iron, dried sinewes of oxen, but-hoops steeped in water, boiling oile, melted tallow, &amp; scalding hot lard. The houses of those Barbarians resound againe, with the blowes that are giuen these miserable men, on the feete and bellie: and the prisons are filled with hideous lamentations and yellings. Their companions haire at this noise standes an end, and their very blood freezeth within them, by consi∣dering how neere themselues are to the like outrages. They passe the nights in prisons, or in some caues of the earth, being hampered and yoaked toge∣ther like brute beasts. Heere the vapor and dampe choaketh them, and the vncleannes and filth of their lodging consumeth them (as rust doth iron) euen aliue. But though the labours of their bodies be so grieuous, yet those of their minds are much more intolerable, for (besides that they want such as might feed them with the word of God, &amp; with the sacramentes, and might teach them how to liue and die well, so as they remaine like plants without moisture) it can not be expressed, with whatforcible temptations their faith
<PB N="419" REF="246"/>
is continuallie assailed. For not onelie the desire to come foorth of these vnspeakeable miseries, doth tempt them; but the commodities and delights also wherein they see others to liue, that haue damnablie renounced their Christianity. The persecutors of the primitiue church, to induce the Mar∣tyrs to denie Christ and to sacrifice to their idols, tried them first with tor∣ments, and then with ease and delights, which they propounded vnto them, if they would become as themselues. For to those, who in the middest of winter were throwne into frozen lakes, there were cōtrariwise appointed soft and delicate beds, with a fier kindled hard by, and a thousand other restoratiues and comforts; to the end they might be doublie tempted, both by the rigor of the cold which benummed them, and by the sweetnes of thinges comfortable and nourishing, which allured them. The Christian slaues are at this day no lesse tormented; for on the one side, they are afflic∣ted with beggerie, nakednes, hunger, famine, blowes, reproches, and tor∣tures, without any hope in a manner euer to come out thereof: and on the other side they see them that haue reneged our holy faith for Mahumets su∣perstition, to liue in all worldly prosperitie and delight, to abound with wealth, to flourish in honour, to gouerne cities, to conduct armies, and to enioy most ample libertie. But amidst all these so great miseries, they haue a double comfort. The one is of priests, who togither with themselues were taken captiue. These men sometimes administring the sacraments, &amp; other whiles deliuering the word of God in the best manner that they can, are some helpe and assistance to others, being for this greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and respected amongst them. The other is of the religious in generall, who contend and labour for their freedome. Wherein Spaine deserueth most high commendation. For there be two most honorable orders, whose exer∣cise it is, to mooue and sollicite for the freedome of captiues. The one is called La orden de la merced, and it flourisheth most in Aragon; and the other (which is farre greater) is named Del Resgate or of raunsome or re∣demption, the which although it largely extendeth ouer all France, yet at this day aboue all other places, it is most rife in Castilia. From whence some of them haue gone into Sicilie, to the kingdome of Naples, and to Rome: and haue there begun to lay foundations of their conuents. These two religious orders gather euery yeere mightie summes of money, where∣with they make speedie redemption of the forsaid captiues. They send their Agents to Fez, and to Alger, who managing this affaire, with no lesse di∣ligence, then loialtie, redeeme first all the religious, and priests, and after them those of the yoonger sort, first the king of Spaines subiects, and then others. They alwaies leaue one religious man in Alger, and another in Fez, who informe themselues of the state &amp; qualitie of the slaues, with their ne∣cessitie, to make the better way for their libertie the yeere following The king of Spaine (whom it most concerneth) furthereth this so charitable a worke, with a bountifull and liberall hand. For ordinarily he giueth as much more, as the foresaid orders haue gathered and collected by way of almes.
<PB N="420" REF="247"/>
For this is so good an enterprise, that by the ancient canons no other is so much fauoured and allowed of. Yea S. <HI>Ambrose</HI> and other holy men haue pawned, for the deliuerie of Christian captiues, the chalices and siluer ves∣sels of their churches. And Saint <HI>Paulinus</HI> for the same end and purpose, solde his owne selfe. For all other actions of charitie are some spirituall, and others corporall, but this in a very eminent degree is both spirituall and cor∣porall togither. For among corporall miseries the seruitude of infidels is most grieuous, &amp; among spirituall calamities the danger of apostasie is of all others the greatest: but those slaues so redeemed, are set free both from the one and from the other. Whereupon there are very few borne in Spain, who dying, leaue not some almes behinde them, for the ransoming of slaues. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of redemption haue gone also many times to Constan∣tinople: where in the yeere 1583. by the order of Pope <HI>Gregorie</HI> the thir∣teenth, they redeemed fiue hundred persons. The brotherhood also of the Confalone in Rome, labour verie diligently in this point, who in <HI>Sixtus Quintus</HI> time, redeemed a great number of captiues. Of whom many also, vrged partly by the hardnes of seruitude, &amp; partly by the sweetenes of liber∣tie, free themselues, either by that which they gaine ouer &amp; aboue their ma∣sters due, or by their good demeanour, or else by flight. And they flie awaie, sometimes by repairing speedily to such fortresses as the king of Spaine hath in Africke and in Barbarie: and otherwhiles they seaze on some ship∣ping, or on the selfe same galleies wherein they are chained. Many also re∣tire themselues to the Princes of Brisch, &amp;c. who willingly receiue and arme them, vsing their assistance in the warre which they continually make with the Turkes of Alger.</P>
