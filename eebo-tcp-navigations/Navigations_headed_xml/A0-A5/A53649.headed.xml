<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the <HI>Eastern</HI> Princes, upon the News of any Fo∣reigner's Arrival, are wont to expect some Curiosities of the Place from whence he came, to prepare the way for his Reception,
<PB REF="4"/>
and Introduce the Stranger into their Presence; so, in imitation of this respectful Custom, this Foreign Voyage hopes for admit∣tance to your Favour and Ac∣ceptance, upon that Stock of No∣velty which it presumes upon; and which it brings with it as well from <HI>Africa,</HI> as several remoter Parts and Kingdoms of the <HI>East:</HI> For in those Places, there are se∣veral Things here taken notice of, which have escap'd the Observa∣tions of other Travellers. I need not mention, my Lord, with what facility you can employ your Judgment, to penetrate into all that is any where useful, whilst your vigorous Fancy can as rea∣dily present to you all that is di∣vertive in its Entertainment. And tho' I confess I have very great Reason to dread the strictness of
<PB REF="4"/>
your Censure, upon the strength of your admirable Endowments; yet methinks I find a relief to this Fear, in that Native Candor, which so easily tempers the Ac∣curacy of your Thoughts with favourable Constructions.</P>
<P>But I will not transgress those Measures of Civility, of which your <HI>EXCELLENCY</HI> is so absolute a Master, by being too tedious in this Address; nor there- violate those Decencies and Re∣spects, which your Practice re∣commends so fully to the World, and of which none have had more sensible Demonstration than my self: Especially considering how much is due to you from the Sacred Order, which you treat with that constant uncommon Civility, as if you design'd to ballance that Contempt, which is
<PB REF="5"/>
too apt to be cast upon it: Imi∣tating, as in other Perfections, so in this too, the Ancient Poets, who instructed Men in Reverencing not only the Gods, but in a due Re∣gard to such as were their imme∣diate Servants; and in all things maintaining still that Greatness by your Munificence, which you freely part with in your Conde∣scensions. I need not determine, with how much Reason the <HI>Eastern</HI> Subjects ascribe this Character to their Emperours, <HI>That their Roy∣al Condition is owing to their Merits, and that they as far transcend other Mortals in those, as they do in Pow∣er;</HI> but I am satisfied, 'tis the un∣questionable Loyalty, Prudence, Greatness of Mind, and other Virtues, which have justly rais'd you to that Sphere, wherein you move, kindly influencing the
<PB REF="5"/>
Affairs of this great Kingdom; and from whence you look down, like the Heavenly Bodies, from the highest Orb, with a kind and obliging Aspect. And that their other Opinion of their Princes, <HI>That they are the Adopted Sons of Heaven,</HI> may be your happy Por∣tion too, is not more unfeigned∣ly desir'd by any, than</P>

<HEAD>A VOYAGE TO <HI>SURATT,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>April</HI> the 11th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ship's departure from <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></NOTE> 1689. the Memorable Day, whereon their Majesties, King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> were Crown'd, did the <HI>Ship Benjamin</HI> break ground from <HI>Gravesend,</HI> towards her intended Voyage to <HI>Suratt</HI> in the <HI>East Indies.</HI> Whither she was sent as an Advice-Ship of that wonderful Revolution, whereby their Sacred Majesties were peaceably setled in
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
the Throne, and had been receiv'd with the Universal Joy of all the Nation. In all places where we came, we were welcomed with loud and chearful Acclamations, and were entertain'd with unusual Congratula∣tions and Respect, as happy Mes∣sengers of as grateful News, as ever arrived in those Parts. They were every where truly sensible of their unexpected Deliverance from that Misery and Thraldom which even there threatned them, and likewise of the invaluable Blessing of living under a Peaceable Government, free from their former Apprehensions, ei∣ther of violence upon their Temporal Enjoyments, or disturbance to the Tranquility of their Minds.</P>
<P>We had not long left the Lands-End of <HI>England,</HI> before we espied a great Fleet of Ships, which appear'd to us at a distance like a floating Fo∣rest, and seiz'd us with no little Con∣sternation. Their lying off not far from <HI>Brest,</HI> made us for some time conjecture them to be <HI>French,</HI> till we were happily undeceived by the ap∣proach of an <HI>English</HI> Frigot, which
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
discover'd them to be Friends. How∣ever, one of our Company, who had faithfully ingaged to stand by us, and on whose Assistance we de∣pended, without any Ceremony, be∣ing apprehensive of the danger, clapt upon a wind, and so left us.</P>
<P>After this, we kept on our course with a favourable Wind, till we arrived at <HI>Madeira,</HI> a small Island appertaining to the Crown of <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> situated about the Two and Thirtieth Degree of Latitude; it is in length, about Twenty Five Miles, about Eight or Ten broad, and Sixty in its Circumference.</P>

<HEAD>THE ISLAND OF <HI>MADEIRA.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island of <HI>Madei∣ra.</HI></NOTE>THis Island, as we are inform'd by good Historians, was first discover'd by <HI>John Gonsalvo</HI> and <HI>Tri∣stan,</HI> under the Patronage of <HI>Henry In∣fanto</HI> of <HI>Portugal.</HI> But the present Inhabitants give us a different Ac∣count of its Discovery, <HI>viz.</HI> That in the Year 1344. an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The disco∣very of this Island by the <HI>Eng∣lish.</HI></NOTE> having Married a Lady of a conside∣rable Fortune, and setting out with her for <HI>France</HI> from the Port of <HI>Bristol,</HI> was by gusty weather, and opposite winds, driven into this Island: Where, upon his Landing, finding it a forlorn Place, both Uncultivated and Unpeo∣pled, he fell into an extream fit of Melancholy, and yielding too much to that black Distemper, contributed by
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
his own Death to make it still the more desolate. The Mariners however, who were not so readily dejected at this Misadventure, set Sail with their Vessel, and landed safely on the Coast of <HI>Barbary;</HI> where, after some Re∣freshment and Respite upon the place, they fortunately fell into the Company of some Ingenious <HI>Portuguese;</HI> to whom, after a little Conference, they Related the Hardships of the Voyage, the Situation and Native Pleasantness of the uninhabited, but most habitable Island they had left, and the just hopes and prospect they had of regaining a sight of it, were they but provided with Ships and Men. This excited the Attention of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and likewise, without much reluctancy, procur'd their Promise of endeavour∣ing with their Prince to incline him to hearken to these Proposals, and like∣wise to equip them with Necessaries and Conveniencies for a second Under∣taking: And succeeding with him ac∣cording to their wishes, they set for∣ward, found the Island, landed their Men, and in a short time converted the Wilderness into a Garden of Pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The disco∣very of this Island by the <HI>Portu∣guese.</HI></NOTE>Some say <HI>Madeira</HI> was discover'd by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> in <HI>Anno</HI> 1429. and de∣riv'd its Name from the abundance of Wood that grew there. It was over∣spread with Wildernesses and plenty of Trees, (which gave it this Name,) as with one intire Wood; the tedious thoughts of cutting down which, per∣swaded them to a more speedy Method of destroying it by fire. After it was kindled, the Flames grew to such a head, raged so violently, and by de∣grees became so furious, that the Peo∣ple were forc'd for their Ease and Pre∣servation, to betake themselves to the water, to avoid the violence of the heat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason of the fruit∣fulness of the Island.</NOTE>The remaining Ashes contributed so much to the Fertility of the Ground, that it at first produced sixty for one, the fruitful Vines brought forth more Grapes than Leaves, Clusters of two or three spans length; and in all its Products, their Beauty and Fertility were so remarkable, that it gain'd the Title of the <HI>Queen of Islands.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its good Air.</NOTE>The Air here, to which the Pleasure as well, as Health of Humane Life is so much owing, is generally very
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
Temperate and undisturbed, and the Heavens smiling and serene. For those Climates which are placed be∣tween the Thirtieth and Fortieth De∣grees of Latitude, enjoy a Tempera∣ture, generally very equal and conve∣nient, infested neither with the ex∣cess of Heat, nor rigid Coldness, but moderately participating of those trou∣blesome Extreams. They seem indi∣sputably to be most suited to the Plea∣santness of Humane Life, and accom∣modated to our Constitutions; afford∣ing that delight to the Body, which Virtue imparts to the Mind, in avoid∣ing all excesses, as dangerous and un∣grateful, and opposite to the Ease, as well of the Sensitive, as Intellectual Part.</P>
<P>The principal Town is <HI>Tunchal</HI> or <HI>Tonzal,</HI> some of them term it <HI>Funchal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Metro∣polis.</NOTE> from the abundance of Fennel which they say grew there. 'Tis the sole place of Trade, from whence they Export all their Wine and their Su∣gar, which is esteem'd superiour to any in the world.</P>
<P>The adjacent Rural Places are very Mountainous; but however, they
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
Rival the Valleys in Fruftfulness and Delight; tho both are much fallen from their Primitive Fertility, and in∣stead of sixty for one, which was the Original Increase,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pre∣sent decay of the Island's Fertility.</NOTE> have gradually de∣scended to twenty five. Seven or eight Rivers with variety of Rivulets refresh the place, which fall down from the Mountains, which, notwithstand∣ing their heighth and steepness, are Planted and Improv'd, as well as the most Champaign ground in <HI>England.</HI> At the utmost top of the high Hills, the Corn thrives well, but the abun∣dance of Clouds that breed there, are prejudicial to the Grapes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Four sorts of Grapes that make the Wine.</NOTE>The main product of the Island is Grapes, brought hither first from <HI>Candy,</HI> of which there are three or four kinds, whereof they make their Wine. One is coloured like Champaign, of little esteem; another is more strong and pale as White Wine; the third sort is rich and delicious, called Malmsey; the fourth is <HI>Tento,</HI> equalling Tent in colour, but far inferiour in Taste; it is never drunk unless in other Wines, with which it is mixt to give them a Tincture, and to preserve them. And
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
for fermenting and feeding them, they bruise and bake a certain Stone, called Jess, of which nine or ten pounds are thrown into each Pipe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The singu∣lar Virtue of the <HI>Ma∣deira</HI> Wine.</NOTE> The <HI>Ma∣deira</HI> Wine has in it this peculiar Ex∣cellence, of being meliorated by the heat of the Sun when it is prick'd, if the Bunghole being open'd 'tis ex∣pos'd to the Air.</P>
<P>The Product of the Vine is equally divided between the Proprietor and him that gathers and presses the Grapes; and yet for the most part the Merchant is Thriving and Rich, whilst the Grape-gatherer, imploy'd by him, is but Poor. Among the Merchants, the <HI>Jesuits</HI> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one of the meanest, who every where contend for prece∣dence in Fortune, as well as in place; and have here secured the Monopoly of <HI>Malmsey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jesu∣its Monopo∣ly of <HI>Malm∣sey.</HI></NOTE> of which there is but one good Vineyard in the whole Island, which is entirely in their possession. Twenty Thousand Pipes of Wine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The quan∣tity of Wine which the Island pro∣duces.</NOTE> by a modest Computation, may be recko∣ned the Annual Increase of the Grapes, which number is thus exhausted and spent. Eight Thousand are thought to be drunk upon the Island, three or four
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
are wasted in Leekage, and the remain∣der is Transported, most of it to the <HI>West Indies,</HI> especially to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where it is drunk more liberally than other <HI>European</HI> Wines.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sucket a choice Sweet∣meat.</NOTE>Plenty of Citrons grow here, of which the Natives make a delicate Sweetmeat, called <HI>Sucket;</HI> and load with it yearly two or three small Ships for <HI>France.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Excel∣lence of the Sugar.</NOTE> The Sugar which in can∣dying them they make use of, and is often effectually prescrib'd against Con∣sumptions, is but rarely transported, because of its scarcity, which hardly supplies the Necessities of the Island.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The scar∣city of Corn.</NOTE>They are some years under great want of Corn, because the Grain that grows here produces no great Plenty; so that sometimes they are threatned with Famine: For prevention of which, while I was there, they used their Au∣thority in Pressing Ships which anchor∣ed in the Road, and commanded them, before they would allow them any Commerce, to the <HI>Azores Islands,</HI> to Import a quantity for their subsi∣stence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The seve∣ral Fruits.</NOTE>This Island affords store of Peeches, Apricocks, Plumbs, Cherries, Figgs,
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>

The <HI>Bonanoe</HI> is with them in singular esteem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fan∣ciful Notion concerning the <HI>Bona∣noe.</HI></NOTE> and even veneration, affecting the Pa∣lat with that sensible sweetness, that it gains with them the credit of being the Forbidden Fruit. And for confir∣mation of this Surmise, they produce the extent of their Leaves, which be∣ing of a large size, they infer from thence, their fitness to make Aprons for <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> to veil their Nakedness. 'Tis almost a Crime inexpiable to cut this Fruit with a Knife, which after dissection gives a faint similitude of our Saviour Crucifi∣ed; and this they say is to wound his Sacred Image. Oranges and Lemons abound here in that Plenty, that I have seen them drop into our Dishes, as we sat at Dinner under their delightful Boughs, and opportunely prevented
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
the trouble of rising up to pluck them, by freely offering themselves to our wants. And these, tho they are in my Opinion as inviting as their Cele∣brated Fruit, and yield as useful and kind Refreshment to the Stomach, must yet not be suffer'd to vie delica∣cie, with their Venerable Admir'd <HI>Bo∣nanoe,</HI> which by the awful Impressi∣ons of a powerful Priest upon the Thoughts of the Vulgar, commences Sacred, and must not be violated by the bold Attempt of any Weapon upon it.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Merchants here, which are not reckoned above a dozen, imi∣tate the <HI>English</HI> way of Living in their City and Country Houses; and, wea∣ried with the Town, divert themselves in their Rural Plantations, to which they gave us <HI>English</HI> that were Stran∣gers a Solemn Invitation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A descripti∣on of a plea∣sant Enter∣tainment.</NOTE> and placed us under the spreading boughs of O∣ranges and Lemons, with living Springs under their refreshing shade. Nature here displayed to us a Scene of Joy and Love, and waited on us in all her Pomp, in all the Delights and Beauties of the Field. The Hills
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
were all cover'd with Vines, and the Valleys with ripe Grapes, which yield∣ed us a fragrant smell from the fruitful Vineyards. The Groves and Woods were all sprightly and gay, nothing seem'd to us drooping or languid, but all things smil'd round about the place of our Entertainment. The Air was clear, and made Melodious by the Voices of Birds. The Ships and Ocean were at a convenient distance, where∣on we looked, and still new Charms sprung from that admirable variety of Objects, whither soever we turn'd our Eyes, and all things conspir'd to yield together a ravishing satisfaction to our Senses. Thus we spent the day in abund∣ance of delight, happy and retir'd from Melancholy and all disturbance.</P>
<P>The ordinary Food of the poorer sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Food of the poor People.</NOTE> is little else in the time of the Vintage, but Bread and ripe Grapes; which simple Nourishment affords sufficient pleasure and delight, when it meets with true Hunger, which never fails of Cooking the Meat with a gusto for the Palate. For Pulses and Leguminous Food, as it was a great part of the Diet of our Forefathers
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
and Antediluvian Patriarchs, and very Congenial to the Nature of Man; so is this spare Food, with a very mode∣rate mixture of Flesh, the frequent Repast even of those here of better Note, who find it easily elaborated and transmitted in such manner as is pro∣per for Digestion; who thereby pre∣serve their Bodies in Health and Strength, and keep the Crases of the Parts pure, which are otherwise per∣verted by Intemperance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tempe∣rance of the People.</NOTE> And were it not for this great abstinence in Eating, the danger of Fevers in the hot Sea∣son would be rarely avoided, and the Venereal Excesses to which they are strangely addicted, with the immode∣rate heat of the place, would be apt to put Nature under various disorders. Therefore Men of the greatest Conse∣quence and Fortune, (whether it be that Sobriety might render them more Spruce and Amorous for the Exercise of Love, or that they are bred up in an Antipathy to that gross and scanda∣lous Vice of Drunkenness,) seldom ex∣ceed the allowable bounds of Drinking, and accustom themselves to a very spare Diet. Nor are they apt to
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
impose their Wine upon others in their ordinary compotations; but the Ser∣vant attending holds the Bottle in his hand, and delivers the Glass to him that Drinks, to receive from the Ser∣vant's hand, who pours out leisurely what the Guest pleases, either a larg∣er or a less quantity; by which means he that is intent upon Drinking, may take his Liberty, and he that is wil∣ling to refrain, is not forced. When the Company breaks up, the Porches and Entries of the Houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The odd convenien∣ces for Ʋrine.</NOTE> and par∣ticularly the private place behind the door, are allowed for the conveni∣ence of Urine; because that action in the Streets is reputed Indecent, and liable to the Censure of Drunken∣ness.</P>
<P>The People very much affect a gra∣vity in their Garb,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cloaths.</NOTE> and are cloathed all in Black, in complaisance (as I imagin) to the Sacerdotal Function, and the better to ingratiate with that Profession, which challengeth so much Authority among them. But they cannot live without the gallantry of wearing the Spado and the Dagger; those inseparable Adjuncts, even of
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
Servants attending their Masters at the Table, who proudly strut with the Dishes in their Hands, in that So∣lemn Garb, with a Basket Hilt to a Sword at least a yard long, even in the midst of Summer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses.</NOTE>Their Houses too, as well as Cloaths, are made without much Expence or Splendour; neither Curious by the Em∣bellishments of Art without, nor Rich in Trappings and Furniture within; some of them shoot up a little in height, without any other Characters of great∣ness: The generality of them are flat-roofed, and all of them give admit∣tance to the open Air thro the Win∣dows, which, being without the use of Glass, are kept open all the day, and closed by Wooden shutters at night.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">No veno∣mous Crea∣ture upon this Island.</NOTE>The Soil allows no venomous In∣habitant, nor Creature of Infectious Malignity, which whether it is peculiar to the Earth or Air, or derivable from some other cause, I know not; who found nothing in this place different from the disposition of others of the same Climate.</P>

<P>Lizards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great number of Lizards.</NOTE> of which they have here an infinite number, are very destructive to their Fruits and Grapes, and mighty devourers of whatever they light upon. But Snakes and Toads, of which in the <HI>Indies</HI> are such innumerable Multitudes, find here no Entertainment; there they haunt the Chambers and private Apart∣ments of the Inhabitants, lurk fre∣quently in the roofs of their Houses, as well as in the Grass; sometimes they espy them in their Chambers and about their Beds, in the Walls and

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The present barrenness of the Island.</NOTE>The Fertility of this Island is much abated from what it was in the time of its first Plantation, and the constant breaking up the ground has made it in many places feeble in its Producti∣ons, so that it wholy discourages their Labours, till it has lain fallow for three or four years; after which time, if there springs up no Broom, as a token of its following Fruitfulness, they desist from all their hopes of its Fertility, and conclude it quite Barren. The present barrenness of much of their Land, re∣minds them of the growth of their Vices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inge∣nuous ac∣knowledg∣ment of their sins.</NOTE> to which they ingenuously ascribe it. Among which, their Effe∣minate Lewdness may very well stand in the front of their Accusations, which prevails not a little, even among those whose double Obligations, of Christi∣ans and Married Persons, should mighti∣ly deter them from that sin;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Lewdness.</NOTE> especial∣ly considering how they may satisfie all their Desires at home, and double their Pleasure by their Innocence. But vagrant Lusts, like other Fires, when
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
they once get head, are not easily tamed and stifled, till they consume those Materials that feed them. This Inconstancy in the Husband encourages (tho it cannot Legitimate,) the same Levity in the Wife, the weakness of whose Sex is not so much proof against the Charms of alluring Temptations. Therefore are the Wo∣men here as apt to defraud their Husbands, as the Husbands are to de∣fraud their Wives, and both equally kind to Strangers, especially the Wo∣men, whose proneness that way, is more excited by their being cloister'd and kept in, and restrain'd from all Company. Their Appetites are aug∣mented by difficulties, and increased by being oppos'd:
<Q>Quod licet, ingratum est, quod non licet acrius urit.</Q>

<P><PB N="20" REF="19"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">No Inter∣view before Marriage.</NOTE>Another reason that offers for their mutual Infidelity, is the Ignorance they have of each others personal Humours, and unacquaintance with their disposi∣tions before Marriage, which some∣times is Celebrated before a mutual Interview has preceeded the Engage∣ment. Whereas a competent time of Courtship and frequent Visits gives them some Inspection into each others Genius and Inclinations, engages their mutual Passions and good Liking, by their constant endearing Presents and Conversation, which by degrees unites their Hearts, and ripens their Affecti∣ons for a happy Marriage. For which purpose it is practis'd in some parts of the World, in the very Minority of their Children, who are engaged by Contract at the years of five or six, as in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>During our stay upon the Island, a young Gentleman of an advanc'd Fortune, which was valued at 60000 Dollars, was ingaged in the Court∣ship of a Lady of 8000, and proceed∣ed to Marriage, without the opportu∣nity of one sight of her before the So∣lemnity, besides what was allow'd

him the day before. He was then, as it happen'd, in the Company of her Brother, and espied thro' a Lattice two young Ladies, and imagining one of them to be his Mistress, was curious to enquire, whether of them it was? To which he receiv'd no more satisfaction, than, <Q>Tomorrow, Sir, is time enough for that.</Q></P>
<P>In Treating about Marriage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Marri∣ages with <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Moors.</HI></NOTE> their principal Enquiries are into the Family and Descent of the Courtier, for pre∣vention of all occasions of the detesta∣ble Affinity with <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> which among them are very numerous.

But the <HI>English</HI> Merchant is on the other side as Reputable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Mer∣chants e∣steemed by them.</NOTE> and stands as fair in their Accounts; his very Name makes way for his admit∣tance, and Incorporating into the best Families, especially if any equality ap∣pears in his Fortune; for their subtle Casuists make sometimes an inequali∣ty of Fortune a just Plea for dissolving a Contract.

<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
<HI>English</HI> Merchant, if he Marries, must first renounce his Religion, and aban∣don the care of his Soul, for the En∣joyment of her in whom he delights. But that which much surpriz'd me, was the prohibition of an Old Gentle∣woman, to the Proceedings of a Young Pretender to her Daughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange conception against Marriage.</NOTE> upon this Account; because she was inform'd of the Health and Soundness of his Con∣stitution, of the Moderation and Cha∣stity of his Manners, so that he was never known to labour under any Ve∣nereal Disease; which she concluded to arise only from the weakness of his Constitution, for it seems she presumed there was no need of the restraints of Conscience for so Venial an Offence, the committing of which, in her Opi∣nion, was Meritorious.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Murther common and unpunish'd.</NOTE>The Execrable Sin of Murther has gain'd too not only an Impunity but Reputation among them, and it is made the Characteristick of any Gen∣tleman of Rank or Fashion, to have dipt his Hands in Blood. To this they frequently are obnoxious, and readily incline, by reason of the easie recourse they have to their Churches, which
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>
shelter them from any Process, and are met with at every turn. For in the Metropolis, <HI>Tunchal,</HI> which exceeds not a good Country Town, are almost twenty Churches and Chappels, besides abundance in their Country Plantati∣ons. These Christians are as Licen∣tious in commiting this Crime, as re∣miss in inflicting due Penalties for it, and indulge the guilt of it, even beyond what the Almighty did the <HI>Jews,</HI> tho' 'tis voluntary, by sparing the Criminal if he can lay hold on the Horns of the Altar; and make Banishment or Con∣finement his utmost Penalty, both which by a large Present are bought off.</P>
<P>The Numbers of their Clergy in∣crease here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Cler∣gie-men.</NOTE> as well as in other Popish Countries, even to the oppression of the Laity, with whom they seem to vie for Multitude. 'Tis scarce imagi∣nable, how so many Rich Ecclesi∣asticks can be supported by the La∣bours of so few People. But to abate this wonder, they tell us, that none of their Nation is admitted to the Priest∣hood, who is not possess'd of some Pa∣trimony, to avoid a burthen to the Church. They are totally averse here

For this end, they closely conceal from publick notice all the Enormities and Irregularities of their Order, and all their Failures, but what are legible in their Ignorance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Igno∣rance.</NOTE> which was so re∣markable, that scarce one in three of those I convers'd with understood Latin. If any Delinquent is expell'd the Convent, his Faults are stifled and kept as secret as Confession, lest the noise of them among vulgar Ears, should scandalously reflect upon their Society, and diminish that Veneration they so zealously affect. And the only Answer which is vouchsafed to any Querist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A prudent Maxim in use among them.</NOTE> for the reason of their Expulsi∣on, is, <Q>He was unworthy of our

<P>The <HI>Jesuits</HI> Chappel is far the most splendid of all their Churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jesuits Chappel.</NOTE> which we chanced to view in the greatest Lustre, at St. <HI>Ignatius</HI> his Eve, (as they are pleas'd to term him) a time observable for the Magnificence of the Ceremony and Pomp: Variety of the choicest Anthems were sung, with the sweetest Instrumental and Vocal Musick, sufficient, had their Doctrine been answerable to it, to have charm'd us into a Conversion. The Vigils of all their Saints, as well as that of St. <HI>John Baptist,</HI> are Celebrated with a∣bundance of shining Lights, placed conspicuously upon the tops of their Steeples, after the Sun-set. But the bright Illuminations this Night about the Steeple of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> Oratory, far out-did the rest of the Apostles Eves, and dazled the Eyes of the Spectators at a distance. Some of the Chappels,
<PB N="26" REF="22"/>
as well as Houses, are built upon such steep declining Hills, that they seem to indanger the precipitation of such as come out of them; and questionless the protection of the Saint is extolled for the deliverance from those Perils.</P>

Among the rest of the Female Penitents, we espied one near the Altar, weeping bitterly, with a sorrowful dejected Countenance, and in deep anguish of Heart. This sight produc'd something of the same Me∣lancholy Effects upon us, till I reco∣vered my self at the hopes I had of her happy Condition, which such floods of Tears seem'd to promise. Had all the rest evidenc'd the like Sorrow and Concern she did, this Infamous Society (for ought I know) had been the most Honourable upon the Island. But their
<PB N="27" REF="22"/>
Measures herein are very unequal, for a modest Salute is an Offence insuffera∣ble, whilst this abominable Vice many of them scarce stand to Parly with.</P>
<P>Their Churches are most commonly made use of for Repositories of their Dead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their bury∣ing places.</NOTE> in the Interment of whom they mix store of Lime with the Earth, to hasten the consumption of the Corps, by whose sudden mouldring away, upon this account, there is room made within a fortnight for a fresh Funeral. To signalize their Respect for the Deceased, the Corps is curiously trimm'd and adorn'd, as a faint Em∣blem of its glorious and triumphant Resurrection, in imitation of the Wise King, who buried with his Royal Fa∣ther an invaluable Treasure.</P>
<P>But as their Church allows no Cha∣ritable Thoughts to the Souls of He∣reticks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No burying place al∣lowed to the <HI>English.</HI></NOTE> so does it forbid all kind∣ness to their dead Bodies, and prose∣cutes the <HI>English</HI> that die there, with more inexorable hatred, than what they shew to the Carcasses of Beasts and Birds, which may find a resting place on shoar, and quietly remain
<PB N="28" REF="23"/>
upon common ground; both which are strictly forbid the <HI>English,</HI> who are cast into the Sea, and committed to the waves. And accordingly an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Merchant falling sick of a sudden Distemper at <HI>Madeira,</HI> was unfortu∣nately carried off by it; which mov'd the rest of our Nation that were there, to contrive for his decent Interment. And therefore, lest a publick Burial might expose him to the Rage of the People, or the Clergy's Indignation, they concluded to deposit him among the Rocks, in order to his better con∣cealment. But the Rocks were una∣ble to shelter him from their Tyranny, which was exercis'd upon him in this barbarous manner, they dragg'd him from the place where he lay, up and down the Island, and expos'd him to the contempt of the Inhabitants, till they threw him into the Ocean. This Inhu∣manity, which is carried even beyond the Grave, is propagated as far as their Plantations in the <HI>East;</HI> where if any Protestant chance to die among the Nation of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> no place is allowed for his Reception, nor vile enough for his Sepulchre, but the very

This Conclusion was approv'd of as Cano∣nical, for the Child was Baptiz'd, Bu∣ried after their manner, and deposited where it was taken up.</P>
<P>The Canons of the Cathedral Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lazi∣ness of some of the Cler∣gie.</NOTE> which stands about the midst of the City, are as exquisite in their contrivance for their Ease, as the others were for burying-mony. The Consti∣tutions of their Church oblige their Attendance at Prayers by Four a Clock in the Morning. But because such early Rising is very troublesome, espe∣cially to Corpulent Men, therefore they agree, that the Clock shall never
<PB N="30" REF="24"/>
in the Morning strike Four, till it real∣ly be Five; and order its motions by this Method, always an Hour or so slower than the Sun, that they may punctually indulge their own Repose, by this mock obedience to the Orders of their Church.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Sea∣men kept on shoar.</NOTE>Yet how negligent soever they may appear in this Instance, they all pre∣tend a mighty Zeal for their Faith, especially in the Meritorious Conver∣sion of any Stranger, upon which we suspected they had been too intent, by the loss we had of some few of our Men, whom no search could discover to us. The <HI>Jesuits</HI> we conjectur'd must be concern'd in it, because their Love for the Cause is generally more flaming than that of the other Orders among them; and therefore we resolved upon addressing to the Governour for de∣manding an enquiry after them in the College of the <HI>Jesuits;</HI> but we found his power could not reach it. The time grew on that we must depart, and were much concern'd to leave our Men, when we were engaged to set Sail, because the want of them on Board might be very prejudicial in a

tedious Voyage. Our Commander therefore having got without Gun-shot of their Citadels, Mann'd out his Pinnace with twelve or fourteen Hands, well provided with Swords and Fire-Arms, and appointed them to Row along the Shoar, to apprehend, if possible, some few of their Fishers, to supply the places of our Sailers. As they cruised along, they met by chance with another Prize, <HI>viz.</HI> a Comely Abbot and a Vicar, coming up to <HI>Tunchal</HI> from the Country in a Boat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Abbot and a Vi∣car seiz'd in the room of our Sea∣men.</NOTE> They were strangely surpriz'd, to find themselves unexpectedly taken, and Pirated by a Boat's Crew; but much more concern'd, when we told them they must bid farewel to all their Friends and Festivities at <HI>Madeira,</HI> and Imbarque with us in an <HI>Indian</HI> Voyage, or at least remain our Prisoners on Board, till the <HI>Jesuits</HI> restor'd our Men on Shoar. The thought of this amazed and struck them with confusion, and forc'd from their Breasts many a groan and sigh, for their Sorrow seem'd to surpass its expression by any Tears. And yet they were not so far lost in this Consternation of Mind, but that they
<PB N="32" REF="25"/>
kept within limits of Reflection, and recollecting a Method for their Release. Therefore they speeded an Express to the Governour, and passionately im∣plored him for the sake of God, and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> to bethink himself of some Project for their Liberty, for which their Prayers should continually ascend for his deliverance from such Disasters. And our Commander va∣luing his Sailers above the Priests, di∣rected a Letter to the <HI>English</HI> Consul on Shoar, to this effect.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Honour and Duty we owe our King and Employers, obliged us to make this Restitution to our selves, since your Governour wou'd not. To deprive Prin∣ces of their Subjects, and Masters of their Servants, under a pretence of making them better Christians, is in my Opinion to make them worse. And if the Religion of your <HI>Jesuits</HI> admit of such Immoral Actions, neither our Laws nor Religion require our taking it at your Hands. If your Gover∣nour has little Command over them, he
<PB N="33" REF="25"/>
has less over us, and he therefore may take the keeping of some of your Subjects as patiently from us, as he does their detaining some of our Sailers (as we presume) from them. In the mean time, endeavour to see they be restored, or rest satisfied with the loss of those we here detain. If your Go∣vernour wou'd not give us satisfaction if he could, he cannot then excuse himself in this matter. If he wou'd, and cou'd not, we shall be so kind, as to do it for him, which may thereupon prove an Obligation, as well to him, as</P>

<P>These Epistles were no sooner re∣ceiv'd and read, but the whole place was in an uproar about their Priests, either their Priests must be return'd, or all the <HI>English</HI> must suffer for it. This startled the <HI>English</HI> Merchants on shore, and awaken'd their Care of contriving some means for their Safety; for they perceiv'd the inraged Multitude, who stood upon the Strand, would not be pacify'd without them. And there∣fore lest our Commander should prove
<PB N="34" REF="26"/>
inexorable, and seriously resolv'd upon what he writ, the <HI>English</HI> Merchants brought along with them Money for a Voyage, after they had prevail'd to get on Board. For they durst not re∣turn without their Priests; and they knew not where the Voyage would end. After their difficult Passage on Board, they related the Confusion the Place was in, and how tumultuous the People had suddenly grown, upon the account of the Detention of their Priests; and how they were upon the Bank of the Sea, repeating their Excla∣mations, <HI>Our Padres! Our Padres!</HI> A sudden Joy sprung up in the Faces of the Priests upon the sight of our <HI>English</HI> Merchants, from whom they assured themselves of some Relief, and Release from the Confinement they were un∣der; and with sorrowful Accents re∣presented to them the unhappy Minute they set forward for <HI>Tunchal;</HI> but withal, the Hopes they had that their coming on Board would prove favou∣rable to their Misfortune. The Com∣mander, who heard all this, and refle∣cting upon the extreme Inconvenience attending the English upon this occasi∣on,
<PB N="35" REF="26"/>
resolved to send them all on Shore, to remove that Disturbance which he saw was otherwise unavoidable; for he thought the Priests would be as use∣less to him at Sea, as they commonly are at Land, and a Burthen to either Element;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Priests dismiss'd.</NOTE> and so dismiss'd them all to their great Satisfaction.</P>
<P>After this we stood off from Shore, fill'd our Sails, and without any Cere∣monious Adieu, either to the Governour or the Fort, we left the Island. For 'tis easier to depart, than to be admit∣ted into the Harbour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Ships examin'd that come to the Har∣bour.</NOTE> Because when any Ship arrives there, two or three of the Inquisitors, who wear the Sacred Garb, are sent to examine it about any Sickness, or other Objection, which might hinder the Liberty of Traffick; and not suffering any Sailer's setting his Foot on Shore till they pronounce the Ship healthful.</P>
<P>By a kind Providence our speedy sailing that Day did occasion a greater Deliverance to us from the French,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our esca∣ping two French Men of War.</NOTE> than what the Abbot and Vicar had from us. Within Forty Hours after our Departure, two <HI>French</HI> Men of War of good Force arrived in the same
<PB N="36" REF="27"/>
Port, who no sooner dropt their An∣chor, but they weighed again in Chace of our Ship, and shaped their Course directly towards the <HI>Canaries,</HI> where some gave out we were design'd. But leaving the Island <HI>Palmo</HI> on the East, we steer'd directly to <HI>St. Jago,</HI> a Capi∣tal Island of <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> whereby we happily defeated their pursuit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Depar∣ture from <HI>Madeira.</HI></NOTE>So the <HI>Cerne Atlantica,</HI> as the Anci∣ents called it, being in a fortunate Mi∣nute left by us, we arrived with Safe∣ty at this Port.

Their Wings are always spread while they move in the Air, where they some∣times sustain themselves the space of a Furlong. When they drop into the Ocean, the watchful Dolphins are ge∣nerally ready to devour them, whose Swiftness in the Water equals almost the Flight of the others in the Air. And as timorous Animals at Land
<PB N="37" REF="27"/>
seek for Shelter from Men, when they find themselves in apparent Danger from a merciless Persecutor; so the Fly∣ing Fish will betake themselves to our Ships, and fall upon our Decks and Shrouds, upon a hot pursuit of the de∣structive Dolphin. Here likewise we were affrighted with a Turnado, which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Turnado.</NOTE> without Care and speedy handing of our Sails, might have endanger'd our Ship. It came suddenly, without any previous signs of its approach, till a quarter of an hour before it came. 'Tis a violent surprizing Storm of Rain and Wind; and that which adds to render it more formidable, is its unexpected Rise, at such times as the Weather is sedate and temperate; but its precipi∣tant Motion renders it less tedious, be∣ing as soon a dying, as it is short in it's Growth and Increase.</P>

<HEAD>THE ISLAND OF St. <HI>JAGO.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Islands of <HI>Cape Verde</HI> are di∣stant from the Main of <HI>Africa</HI> 150 Leagues; they extend themselves in a Body from 13½, unto the 19th in Latitude. Ten of these Islands are con∣siderable, tho' not inhabited, and are rang'd in Form of a Crescent; of which the Convex Part regards the Conti∣nent, and the Two points the Ocean.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Jago.</HI></NOTE>The Night before we came to an Anchor we espied this Island of St. <HI>Ja∣go,</HI> which is the greatest and principal of all the Isles of <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> and is dig∣nify'd with a Bishop's Seat in a City of the same Name. They borrow their Appellation of <HI>Cape Verde</HI> from the Cape or Prominence of Land in <HI>Africa,</HI> which is the nearest Main Land to
<PB N="39" REF="28"/>
them, from whence several <HI>Africans</HI> come here to inhabit. These by the Ancients were call'd <HI>Gorgades</HI> and <HI>He∣sperides,</HI> who feigned the Orchards with Golden Apples, which were kept by a Dragon, were placed here.</P>
<P>In this Island are various Ports,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Chief Port.</NOTE> the most noted of which we anchor'd in, named <HI>Praya,</HI> where, by the Blessing of Heaven, we escaped an eminent Danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dan∣ger which we escap'd.</NOTE> which arose from a violent Storm in the Night-time; and was so outragious, that the Ship dragg'd her Anchor; and our Ruine had been in∣evitable, had it been much fiercer; be∣cause we rid so near St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which was on one side; and <HI>Hay Island,</HI> which lay on the other.</P>
<P>The Island at our approaching it lookt very desolate and naked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Barren∣ness.</NOTE> without any apparent Verdure either of Grass or Leaves. And the reason for this, upon our Examination, was very plain, because in Three Years space before that Day we came thither, they had not been refreshed with one Shower of Rain, which occasion'd an extreme Drought and Stelitity, and gave it the Face rather of the Desarts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> than of a plentiful Country.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="29"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Compari∣son of it with <HI>Ma∣deira.</HI></NOTE>The Air is neither so healthful, nor the Place so pleasant, as <HI>Madeira,</HI> which has so many Houses and delightful In∣closures, that it seems to be a Gar∣den of Pleasure. Neither is it so moun∣tainous as that Island, which makes it apt enough for Plantations; and yet here are but very few Vines, and those incompetent for affording any Wine; most of which that is drunk is import∣ed to them from <HI>Madeira.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Pro∣ducts.</NOTE>In the Valleys are Grains, Vines, Fruits, Sugar-Canes, Mellons, Bono∣noes, better than those at <HI>Madeira,</HI> Dates, Coco-Nuts. They abounded not with Cattle, but of Fowl they had plenty; for which, or for any o∣ther of their Commodities, we traded with them for old Cloaths, and cast Garments, a staple sort of Merchan∣dise with these <HI>Portuguese,</HI> whose Hu∣mour, which generally is vain and haughty, will make them vaunt them∣selves like Fidolgoes, when they are on∣ly thus apparell'd. But that which is meaner in them much, than strutting in the over-worn Garments of Sailers and other Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Na∣tives poor and thie∣vish.</NOTE> they are strangely ad∣dicted to pilfering and stealth; and one
<PB N="41" REF="29"/>
or two of them will entertain you in Discourse, whilst the third takes off your Hat, or snatches away the Sword from your side. And if they meet any Stranger at a Distance from any Town, they seldem fail of stripping him naked.</P>
<P>They are ignorant here in the Hus∣wifery of making either Butter or Cheese, which are therefore valuable, because rare. And accordingly, a cou∣ple of Cheese, twelve Stock-fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Present to the Go∣vernour.</NOTE> and two Dozen of Poor Jack were kindly received by the Governour of the Town, who was at this time unable to supply us with a Loaf of Bread; which made a Sea-Bisket as acceptable to them, as fresh Provisions, after a long Voyage, would be to us.</P>
<P>A Romish Prelate govern'd the Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gover∣nour of the Island.</NOTE> and presided in their Civil as well as Ecclesiastical Affairs; and, without that Niceness which is practic'd at <HI>Madeira,</HI> admitted the Native <HI>Africans</HI> to offi∣ciate in their Oratories and Convents.</P>
<P>Most of the People are Negroes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inha∣bitants.</NOTE> transported from <HI>Africa</HI> to settle here, converted to the <HI>Roman</HI> Faith. Their Cloathing is a kind of Indian-like
<PB N="42" REF="30"/>
Stuff, turn'd about their middle care∣lesly; the rest of the Body is all bare, save their Breasts and Shoulders, which are covered with some thin Stuff.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the Penance they were under by the Scarcity of Bread and Wine, the Women were very loose in their Behaviour, and easily led away by the Sailers, whose Immoral Extra∣vagancies have occasion'd this Prover∣bial Speech in <HI>India,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An English Proverb in <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> That <HI>in Sailing from hence thither, they leave their Con∣sciences on this side of the</HI> Cape; <HI>and in returning from thence to</HI> Europe, <HI>they leave their Consciences on the other side the</HI> Cape.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island <HI>Fogo.</HI></NOTE>Near this Island is another called <HI>Fogo,</HI> remarkable for its Sulphureous Vapours, which like <HI>Aetna</HI> and <HI>Vesu∣vius,</HI> it continually emits; which sally forth in such Eruptions, that it annoys all the adjacent parts, by continual vo∣miting of Flames and Smoak; from this burning Mountain such quantities of Pumice-stones are ejected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pumice-stones.</NOTE> that they swim upon the Main Ocean, and are variously dispers'd by the Currents of

The Height of this <HI>Volcano</HI> is considerable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The height of the Island <HI>Fogo.</HI></NOTE> and its aspiring Top is raised above two Stories in the Clouds, which are rang'd each below the other upon its declining sides. The Head of the Mountain advanced in height in a dou∣ble Proportion to the highest of the Clouds; which were not very long in ripening, but presently put on their Aery Body. The same thing I obser∣ved upon the Table-Land of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> where the Vapours fa∣shion'd themselves into Clouds imme∣diately upon their Exhalation from the Mountains, and ranged themselves, as they rise, in due Order and Progress through the Air.</P>
<P>Before we had sailed many Leagues from this Shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade-Winds.</NOTE> we were under the Influence of the Trade-Winds, which blow on both sides of the Lines to ma∣ny Degrees distance; and with such constant gentle Gales, that except it be upon occasion of a sudden, violent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pleasant sailing be∣tween the Tropicks.</NOTE> and stormy Gust of Weather, the Sail∣ers make all that passage Holiday, and
<PB N="44" REF="31"/>
are not forced to hand a Sail in the space of many Days. The Days here are regular, and almost of an equal length, not apt to be infested with Storms, or darkned with Clouds, or overcast with Showers, except it be upon the nearer Approaches of the Sun, who usually skreens his direct scorch∣ing Beams by the Interposition of wa∣try Vapours; and now neither boiste∣rous Winds nor swelling Seas do raise any Fear or Disturbance in the Mari∣ners Breast. 'Tis this kind indulgent Weather that mainly animates Men to the undertaking of this tedious Voyage. For otherwise the length of it would be insupportable, were it all along in∣commoded by the Storms and Dangers of our Northern Seas; the Thoughts of which wear off by degrees, as we recede from them, and fall insensibly into milder Climates; where the calm Face of the Heavens smooths the rug∣ged Aspect of the Men, makes them forget their former rough and trouble∣som Weather, and solace and enjoy themselves in this sweet welcom change of Air.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="31"/>Great store of Sharks swum now a∣bout our Ship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Shark, Pilot-fish, and Suck∣ing-fish.</NOTE> with their Attendants and Adherents the Pilot-fish and the Sucking-fish, which are about four or five Inches long. The Pilot-fish are the same to the Shark, as the Jackalls are to the Lion, direct him in his Course, and find out his Prey, and give him notice of any Danger. The Suck∣ing-fish stick close to the Shark, as some small Fish do upon Lobsters, and suck their Nourishment out of him. This Fish forsakes not the Shark in the greatest Dangers, is his faithful Adhe∣rent in his utmost Extremities; he cleaves to him even when he is forc'd out of his Element, and brought on Board the Ship, attends him to his Fu∣neral, and dies with him. The Under Jaw of the Shark is so much lower than the Upper, that he cannot take his Bait, but by turning upon his Back to receive it with more Facility. They are eagerly voracious, and are furnish'd with Instruments accordingly; with a Sett of Teeth as keen as their Stomachs, which easily lop off the Leg or Arm of a Man, and afford no more than one Morsel to that ravenous Animal. Yet
<PB N="46" REF="32"/>
are they peculiarly tender and indul∣gent to their Spawn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Conje∣cture how the Sharks spawn their young ones.</NOTE> and shelter them in the place that gave them Birth: For when ever the Young Ones are in Dan∣ger, they immediately hasten to the Mouth of the Old One, and retire to its inward Parts for Safety. By this I was apt to think, that they spawned their Young Ones at their Mouth, be∣cause we have seen them come out and go in at the Sharks Mouth, and found one Six Foot long in a Sharks Belly. Several Dolphins followed our Ship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dolphins describ'd.</NOTE> which surpass all the Creatures of the Watry Element in Beauty and a quick Finn, and is therefore called the Ar∣row of the Sea. They shine the bright∣est, and swim the swiftest, of any Fish in the Ocean; and their lively Colours represent in the Water the shining Wings of some bright Flies. But as they leave their Element, their Beauty fades; and as their Life, so does their Splendour decay; the lightsom Colours begin to fade and mourn at Death's Approaches, and turn quite dark and dusky at their Expiration. It is nei∣ther the Number, nor the Largeness of the Finns, that contribute towards
<PB N="47" REF="32"/>
their extraordinary Swiftness; for they are but few, and very small; two on∣ly near the Jowl, and two small ones under the Belly, and a narrow long one upon the Back. The Head is fa∣shion'd sharp above, and downwards descends broader, almost like the Head of a Hatchet with the Edge upwards. Upon the top of his Tongue he has ma∣ny little Teeth. It is a lovely, neat, and clean Fish, and as like to the Dol∣phin on the Sign-Posts as a Mackrel is to a Flounder. The Flesh of it is white and delicate, which when larded and roasted fresh, no Roman Dainties or Eastern Luxury can out-vie the grateful Food.</P>
<P>After these an infinite number of Porpoises plaid about our Vessel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abundance of Porpoises</NOTE> and spread themselves near half a League round our Ship. One of them was caught by the Tail with a running Knot made by the Sailers, whose Liver and Entrails nearly resembled those of an Hog; and the Blood that issu'd from it was thick and red, like that of a Bul∣lock: It strangely detain'd its Blood, after a deep Wound in the Throat, and stopt the Effusion of it for a very

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Albicores and Bonet∣toes.</NOTE>We met likewise with Shoals of Al∣bicores (so call'd from a piece of white Flesh that sticks to their Heart) and with multitudes of Bonettoes, which are named from their Goodness and Ex∣cellence for eating; so that sometimes for more than twenty Days the whole Ship's Company have feasted on these curious Fish.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sailers Lives pre∣serv'd by Sea-fish.</NOTE> Several Vessels in tedi∣ous Voyages, which by contrary Winds have been retarded in their Sailing, have owned the Preservation of their Lives to this kind Providence, which has often supplied them with this sort of Food in the time of their Extre∣mity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether Fish sleep?</NOTE>As we sailed along there happen'd an Accident, which made me conclude, that either the Fish do not sleep, or that they subsist much longer without it than other Animals. We struck an Albicore upon the Tail with a Fish-spear, which afterwards made its E∣scape by dropping off the Hock. This very Fish, as we all observ'd, follow'd our Ship daily above a Week, when we sailed at least two Degrees, that is,
<PB N="49" REF="33"/>
an Hundred and Twenty Miles a Day, and never left us all the while. We saw it early in the Mornings, by that time we were able to discern any such thing at that Distance; and till the Darkness of the Evening intercepted our Sight, we never missed it. The peculiar Mark we distinguisht it by, was the large Wound in the Tail, which was lacerated by the Fish-spear, when it fell off, and in constant swim∣ming near our Vessel discover'd it ve∣ry plainly to us; all which time it kept Pace with us, and rested no more than we.</P>
<P>We had not the luck of seeing a Cramp-fish, for an Experiment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of the Cramp-fish.</NOTE> all the Voyage; but Dr. <HI>Kempfer,</HI> in his Pas∣sage through the <HI>Persian Gulph,</HI> relates how he caught one, and that it struck the Person with a frightful Tremor, whoever touch'd it with Hand or Foot; but the benumming Quality would not reach to the length of a Line or a Pole, according to the vulgar Opinion, and operated only when it was sensibly struck or handled. But the way of preventing this Trembling and Stupi∣dity of him that felt it, was most wor∣thy
<PB N="50" REF="34"/>
Observation, because unknown, and scarce mentioned by any Writer. For a certain Person on Board, to the A∣mazement of all that saw him, could touch the Torpedo as oft as any, and was never affected by any Insensibility upon it. He was shy of divulging his Receipt, but by Importunities was at length won to declare the Secret, which consisted only in holding in his Breath very hard when he touched it. The rest upon Trial found it true. And the Reason for this (as 'tis supposed) is, that stifling the Breath, and detaining the Spirits, repels the Force of that Narcotick or stupifying Quality which issues from the Body of the Cramp-fish.</P>

the Observation of the expertest Na∣vigator, before ever he knows where he is, if he be not help'd by his Azi∣muth Compass. An Instance of this Nature happen'd while I was in <HI>India.</HI> An <HI>East-India</HI> Ship bound for <HI>Bombay,</HI> was suppos'd by the Master of her to be near that Haven, upon his first sight of Land; but making better Observa∣tion, he found himself driven many Degrees to the Westward, very near <HI>Mussat</HI> in <HI>Arabia Foëlix,</HI> which lies up∣on the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph. For this no Reason can be alledged, besides the un∣discernible Currents of the Water, which carry the Ships so wide from that place, which by their Course they steered towards: For in one Hours time the Water runs above a League, sometimes in the very midst of the O∣cean. And another Ship bound for the same Port, was upon the first Discove∣ry of Land very near the Coast of <HI>Per∣sia.</HI> Therefore the wary Pilots, when the Winds are silent, and the Sea calm, use this Expedient for trying the Moti∣on of the Water, which way, and how fast the Currents set. At Seven Mi∣nutes Distance from the Line, our Com∣mander
<PB N="52" REF="35"/>
mann'd out the Boat, with the chief Mate in it, and ordered it to be rowed about half a League from the Ship. They took with them in the Boat a Basket, into which they put Forty or Fifty Pound Weight of Iron or Lead, which tied to a Line of eighty, or an hundred Fathom length, they dropt into the Sea; by whose Weight the Boat was fixt as immovably and steddy, as if it were at an Anchor. Af∣ter this they cast out the Log-board, which discovers the Tide-way of the Water, and by the Half Minute Glass which they set a running, they know how fast the Stream runs. For at certain Distances of the Line, to which the Log-board is fastned, are cer∣tain Knots, for every one of which that the Board drew off, while the Glass runs, they reckon a Mile. The Tide set here Northward, but not ve∣ry fast. This Experiment of finding out the Swiftness of the Current, and to what Points it runs, is never at∣tempted but in a perfect Calm, when both the Winds and the Sea are peace∣able and still; which is the reason that Mariners, by not meeting with such an

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Annobon</HI> describ'd.</NOTE>THE first Land we made after our crossing the Aequinoctial, was <HI>An∣nobon,</HI> which lies in the Latitude of one and an half, and is reckon'd about Ten Leagues in its Circumference. We were driven unhappily to the Leeward of it, and luffed up to it for the space of two days, but were hindred from fetching it, by its lying directly in the Eye of the Wind. It had the name of <HI>Annobon</HI> given it, because it was first discovered upon the first Day of the Year.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its great Plenty.</NOTE>The scarcity of our fresh Provisions, which by this time were almost spent, made us beat up to Windward more vigorously, especially when we heard
<PB N="55" REF="36"/>
that they were to be purchased at such easie rates, that a roasting Pig might be bought for a Sheet of Paper.</P>
<P>But tho' we judg'd our selves unfor∣tunate in not being able to reach this plentiful Island, yet we were pleas'd with the Prospect which we had of it, because we had been long Strangers to such a Sight. And it gratified us with the fragrant Smells which were wafted from the Shoar, from whence at three Leagues distance we scented the Odours of Flowers and fresh Herbs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Land smell'd by the Sailers at a great distance.</NOTE> And what is very observable, when after a tedious Stretch at Sea, we have deem'd our selves to be near Land by our Observa∣tion and Course, our Smell in dark and misty Weather has outdone the Acute∣ness of our Sight; and we have disco∣ver'd Land by the fresh Smells, before we discern'd it with our Eyes.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants observing our Toil and Industry to stretch into the Har∣bour, made Fires on Shoar to give us Light in the Night time, and sent off to us with some Oranges and Fowls a Canoo or two, that is, a long sharp Boat fashion'd out of one piece of Tim∣ber, which was rowed with Six Oars.
<PB N="56" REF="37"/>
The Islanders that came in it were for∣merly known to some on Board us, whom we conferred with concerning their Belief, and the Religion which they professed. They confess'd them∣selves of the <HI>Roman</HI> Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Igno∣rance of the People.</NOTE> and were eminent Believers of that Church by the profound Ignorance which they profess'd, in scarce knowing what Mass meant, or the Pope from the great Mo∣gul. They were born in <HI>Africa,</HI> and, bating the Name of Catholicks, were as Heathenish, as if they had never come from thence, which they ascrib'd to their want of Priests among them. No Priests! This amaz'd me, and put me to a stand, to consider how those who travel Sea and Land to make Pro∣selytes, to whom neither <HI>Siam, China,</HI> nor <HI>Japan</HI> are esteemed too remote a Pil∣grimage for making Converts, should yet neglect a place so nigh as <HI>Annobon,</HI> overlook a Care so much nearer. Sure∣ly some fatal Disease, some Infectious Air must ravage and lay waste the place, that affrighted those zealous Fa∣thers from inhabiting among them. No, the Air was healthful and serene, the Island fruitful, but very poor;

they know of no reigning Distempers among them, unless we would account Poverty one. They were stor'd with plenty of Provisions, and indigent in nothing but Gold and Silver, of which they had none. Or if they were Ma∣sters of a little of that at some chance time, the first Priest that happen'd to come upon the Island, was certain of draining it by Confessions, whose stay was never longer among them, than the Money lasted, but his Minutes were always spent as soon as their Mites. Now I imagin'd that a place, where was such scarcity of Wealth, should have best suited with those whose Pro∣fession is Poverty; because they seem then to be in their proper Element, and freed from the Temptations of Riches, which they voluntarily renounce. And that the Eastern Nations, which abound in Wealth and Luxury, should be less frequented by Men that pretend to be dead to the World.</P>
<P>Upon this Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Conveni∣ence of some Har∣bours.</NOTE> as well as upon ma∣ny others, the Road for Ships lieth con∣veniently on the Leeside, as at St. <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI> which is under the Line, <HI>Ascension, St. Helena, St. Jago, Mauritius,</HI> and many

more, as well in the <HI>East</HI> as <HI>West Indies,</HI> which are by an All-wise Providence made this way serviceable for avoiding the danger of Shipwrack, which would be inevitable on the Weather-side, when the Winds blew fresh, and the Seas were high. For in these places the Winds generally hang towards one Quarter, which renders the opposite part of the Island calm and safe. And though some few Islands are observ'd destitute of this Convenience in their Harbours, and are not so well accom∣modated with Ports for the securing of Ships, yet are these very rare, and for the most part not very necessary for Navigators to come near them.

The richest Wine could not please our Palates with half that Delight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scarcity of Water on Board.</NOTE> as this Blessing which descended from Heaven in Showers upon us. For being all this while under the hot Influence of the Sun-Beams confin'd to the Torrid Region, the Provisions, being salt Beef,

and the Water in the Cask so unsa∣voury and corrupt, that to quench our Thirst we must stifle our smelling, and shut our Nostrils when we open'd our Mouths; and of this poor stinking Li∣quor, in all this Feverish Weather, the Allowance being only a Quart a Day, this made a Glass of this fresh Liquor drink most pleasant, and cheer'd our Hearts, as if they had been refresh'd with the noblest Wine. For impatient of letting it fall into the Tubs, which were placed upon the Decks on pur∣pose to receive the falling Water, no Wine was more greedily catcht at by the Vulgar out of publick Conduits on a solemn Day, than the Rain was by the Sailers in their Bowls and Hats.

<PB N="61" REF="39"/>
gently rising Hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fruit∣fulness of the place.</NOTE> cloathed with Grass and variety of Trees, all in their Sum∣mer Livery. This unexpected Verdure of the Fields tempted us to fancy our selves rather in <HI>Europe</HI> again, than upon the Confines of scorcht <HI>Africk.</HI> Such was the Beauty of the pleasant Fields and fruitful Valleys, the Gayety of the Woods, and diversity of Inclosures, cut out by Nature, rather than cultivated by Art, that it would almost foil the Pencil of a Painter to outdo the Origi∣nal, but surely it would afford him Ground for an admirable Landskip. The Fertility of this populous Climate, which lies within the Torrid Zone, has quite confuted the Opinion of blind An∣tiquity, which could not discern the Life of either Man, or Vegitable there. I could not behold any great Plenty of Corn or Grain; but this proceeded ra∣ther from the Native Laziness, than from the Penury of the Soil, whose Na∣tive Turf seem'd well prepar'd for Fer∣tility and Production; but it abounds with store of Fruits, particularly Coco-Nuts, and the most fragrant Pine-Ap∣ple, which carries the Precedence from all the rest, whose Excellencies are cen∣ter'd

<P>We were not yet come to an Anchor, which continued the scarcity of our Wa∣ter, notwithstanding the former shower; and made us prize it almost equal with our Wine, with which we were well stockt from the fruitful Island of <HI>Madei∣ra;</HI> but on a sudden we were more concern'd and affrighted at the sight we had of that Element, than we were re∣fresh'd by it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Spout at Sea.</NOTE> For we espy'd very near us a mighty Mass of Water drawn up into the Air from the Surface of the Ocean, in fashion of a large round Pipe, incircled with a hoary Mist, or grey Cloud; it rose gradually, and for some time hover'd there, till at length it fell in such a Cataract, such a Torrent and mighty Flood, that no Ship was able to sustain its fall, but would sink and founder by its Weight. This Spout,
<PB N="63" REF="40"/>
which is a kind of Aqueduct between the Clouds and the Ocean, put us in a great Fear of its ruinous Descent upon us, had we not industriously steered from it, and kept to Windward. But if there is no avoiding the likelihood of being driven under it, there are two ways prescrib'd for breaking its pendu∣lous resting in the Air before a Ship comes too near it. The first, which is seldom used by any Protestant, pre∣vents its Danger by a kind of Charm. When they espy a Spout at Sea at some distance from them, the Master of the Ship, or any one else a-board, kneels down by the Mast with a Knife in his Hand, which has a black Handle; and reading in St. <HI>John</HI> the Verse of our Sa∣viours Incarnation, <HI>Et verbum Caro fa∣cta est, &amp; habitavit in nobis,</HI> he turns towards the Spout, and with the In∣chanted Knife makes a Motion in the Air, as if he would cut it in two, which, he says, breaks in the middle, and lets the inclosed Water fall with a Noise into the Sea.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of breaking a Spout.</NOTE> Another Method for preventing all Peril that might arise from this Mass of Water suckt up from the Ocean, is to fire a Cannon or

What the Quality of this Wa∣ter is, which is thus powerfully exha∣led, whether fresh, or mixt with Sa∣line Particles, those that had the Fate to try, had scarce the Happiness to dis∣cover; but sure the Phaenomenon is very stupendous and unaccountable, that such a vast Body of Water should by a forcible extraction out of the Sea bubble and mount upwards, like a small Rivulet springing up into the Air. And indeed, the Works of the Almigh∣ty are inscrutable, and these may be some of <HI>his Wonders in the Deep,</HI> which the Royal Prophet extolled and was amazed at.</P>
<P>Having arrived within four Leagues of the Shoar, Eight <HI>Negroes</HI> came to∣wards us in a <HI>Canoo,</HI> who stood up∣right as they rowed, and looked for∣ward, contrary to our Proverbial Ob∣servation. The Shaft of their Oars was framed out of a long piece of Timber, and a thin broad square board resemb∣bling

a wooden Trencher, served for the Blade. They had caught in their Boat a Shark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Shark called a Shovel-Mouth.</NOTE> of a different shape from the common Fish of that Name, and of a different appellation; for on each side of his Mouth grew a large piece of Fish, six Inches broad, in form of a Shovel, which gave it the Name of Shovel-mouth; and at the extremity of those parts were the Eyes placed, as Centinels at the Out-Guards to pre∣serve the Body. With these came two of the Principal Men of the place, one of them appertaining to the King, the other a Retainer to the <HI>Mafoucko</HI> or Ge∣neral. Upon their Heads they wore Caps very Curious and Costly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Curious Caps made in <HI>Africa.</HI></NOTE> the Work of the Natives, wrought with so much Ingenuity and Art of the Needle, that they are not only valued there, but admired in all the parts whither the <HI>Europeans</HI> carry them.

Ermin or Sables. Their frizled Hair was tyed up in a Bunch upon the Crown of the Heads of some of them, others wore it neatly braided behind. Some cut their Hair in the figure of a Cross, others were shaved all bare, excepting a small Tuft above, like a <HI>Mahometan</HI> Lock, as each Man's Humour or Fan∣cy led him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Or∣naments.</NOTE>On each side of their Temples, and on their Fore-heads, the Skin was rais∣ed, as if it were with the pricking of a Pin, in Figures of a Diamond cut; which with them is not only a Badge of Honour and Character of Greatness, but is esteem'd a sort of Cosmetick to the Face, and admired as Fucus and Black Patches are with us.</P>
<P>Coral Beads, Coories, or Indian-shels, and Black Jet Beads are wore as Or∣naments about their Necks; and about their Wrists, ten or twelve Wreaths of Brass, Iron, or Copper.</P>

Among those who were pleased to give us a Visit on board, was the little <HI>Mafouko,</HI> or Deputy General, who while he diverted himself with us, espy∣ed among the Negroes, a Native of that Country, who was formerly sold from thence, and falling into the Hands of our Commander, was brought thi∣ther again to attend him in the Voy∣age. The Deputy General disguised his knowledge of him a while, and cast only a negligent Eye towards him, 'till the Negro observing it, approached

I wish they had used our Language as innocently, as they did our Garments, and that they had been less accustomed to the execrable sin of Swearing by the Name of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swearing used among them.</NOTE> and the habitual vent∣ing

of horrid Oaths. This custom they impiously Imbibed by their Conversa∣tion with our Sailors, whose frequent Oaths made them believe them an E∣legance of our Speech, and the most laudable Expressions they could use; and this deadly sin they now digest with as much ease, as the young Maid, whom <HI>Albertus</HI> reports, brought her Stomach to live upon Spiders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fa∣ces painted</NOTE>The second Person of Eminence who came to visit us, had all his Face be∣smear'd with Red Paint, a thing customary among the Nobler Rank; as in <HI>India</HI> this Colour is put upon their Cattle, especially their Horses, and is the usual Paint of their Fruit Trees.

<P>The Diet of the common People is very ordinary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ordina∣ry Food of the Poor People.</NOTE> and seldom reacheth the Flesh of any Animal, which is not prohibited them by any Law, but their Inability to purchase it.

These Pindars are sown under ground, and grow there without sprouting a∣bove the surface, the Cod in which they are Inclosed is an Inch long, like that of our Pease and Beans, and they are eat with Beef or Pork instead of our Beans or Pease. Some of these I brought for <HI>England,</HI> which were sown in the Bishop of <HI>London</HI>'s Garden, but whe∣ther they will thrive in this Climate is yet uncertain. The Flesh which they eat, they never account Palatable, till it grows unsavory; they expose it up∣on the Roofs of their Houses till the moisture is exhausted, and it looks like

<P>The extent of Dominions, and Love of Wealth, are as prevalent with those that are placed in the highest Orbs of Fortune here, as they are with other Monarchs of the Earth.

who as soon as they are Captives are made Slaves, and in the multitude of them the Strength and Wealth of their Kingdoms consist.

On this Day some Person of Years and Discretion, of Repute for Sobriety and Civil Converse, en∣tertain the Youth and those of green∣er Years with strong Disswasives from the customary Vices of Stealth, Im∣purity, Adultery, and Murther; and with all the Rhetorick which Na∣ture taught him, and Zeal inspires him with, disclaims against those Criminal Practices, and raises his Invectives against Vice and Folly, and whatever is odious and prohibited among them. For all the hainous Vices are under a Proscription with them, as well as us, and are only committed by daring Pro∣fligates. The Terror of immediate Punishment is not the only Restraint from these Commissions, but the sage Admonisher affrights their Conscien∣ces with a future miserable state, in the dreadful Society of <HI>Benimbe,</HI> that is, the Devil, if they obstinately per∣sist in Wickedness; and encourages them with the Promise of being here∣after happy with <HI>Zammampoango,</HI> which
<PB N="82" REF="50"/>
signifies God, if they carefully advert to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their No∣tion of God, and the Souls Im∣mortality.</NOTE> and practise his Instructions. These Ignorant Heathens have not yet lost the Notices of the Soul's Immortality, and the Impressions of future Rewards and Punishments are fresh and undefaced among them. I enquired of them what their Sentiments and Notions were of their <HI>Zammampoango?</HI> They told me that he inhabited above. Then I further asked, whether they meant by that, the glorious Lights above, the Sun, the Moon, or the Heavens?

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Devil's Cruelty to some of the People.</NOTE>They generally affirm'd that <HI>Benim∣be</HI> is frequently in the Fields cover'd with Mists and thick Darkness, where he sometimes exercises his Infernal Au∣thority over infamous and lewd Per∣sons, in the milder Chastisements of some, and severer Treatment, even as far as the loss of Life, of others. There∣fore they are terrified from walking abroad in dark and gloomy Weather, because they expect nothing but Hor∣ror and Misery from that Spirit of
<PB N="83" REF="50"/>
Darkness. This Infernal Spirit in all his wild Insults and Frolicks over them, is careful to preserve his Appearance as dark as the place he chuses to revel in, scarce assumes any lasting Form, and is known by nothing so much as the plentiful effects of his Stripes and seve∣rer Strokes upon their Bodies. He con∣ceals the Deformity which he usually makes of his Figure, whilst he exer∣cises the Malignity of his Temper. Some die of the Bruises they have re∣ceived from him, and others have been confin'd to their Beds, as they assured me several times, and therefore they avoid the Fields in rainy dull Weather, that they may escape the force of his Malice, who is ashamed to appear a∣broad by Light, but chuses these me∣lancholy Seasons for inflicting his Ven∣geance, to which he seems to have most right, as he is a Spirit of Darkness.</P>
<P>Walking along the Shoar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Negroe impal'd for committing several murthers.</NOTE> we were arrested by a very deplorable Spectacle, a lusty Negro stretched Dead upon the Sand, who, after the manner of Im∣paling, had a long Stake thrust up his Fundament, which by a sharp Passage through his Bowels forced its way up∣wards towards his Head. The dread∣ful
<PB N="84" REF="51"/>
sight at first moved us to condole the sad Object, till we were inform'd of the execrable Villanies which brought him to this lamentable and painful end, and made us applaud the Justice of those who were the Executioners of this Vengeance upon him. For no Se∣verity was able to match those Crimes wherein he had been a long and skilful Practitioner; even this Destiny, tho' so horrid and severe, will yet be thought Indulgence, and an Act of Clemency. This Miscreant being possess'd with a Spirit of Cruelty, and actuacted by Malice, had successfully contriv'd the Death of near twenty Persons about this place, by mixing a deadly Poyson with the Palm Wine, which he season∣ably offer'd for the refreshment of their parched Palates. This deadly Liquor was not subject to any suspicion of being mortal, because the Juice of the Palm, with which it was intermixt, was a Liquor so common and inoffen∣sive, and their best and most pleasing Drink. The King therefore, upon the Information of this Fellow's treache∣rous dispatching of his Subjects by such poysonous Draughts, immediately de∣creed
<PB N="85" REF="51"/>
a Punishment, and sentenc'd the Criminal to this torturing Death, pe∣culiar only to such barbarous Villans. The News of which made him seek a Refuge among the Desarts and the most inhabitable parts of the Country; but the pursuit after him was so vigorous, that no Thickets could shelter or secure him, the whole Country hotly pursued him, and chased him as a common Ene∣my, till at length he fell a Victim to their just Rage upon this Shore; where his noisom Carcase, being under an In∣terdict of being Interr'd (the ordinary manner of burying among them) be∣came as loathsom and offensive as his Life had been, and was left a Prey to the Savages of the Wilderness, and the wild Beasts of the Field. The unusual manner of tormenting this Malefactor, by exposing his Body to the Inclemen∣cy of the Weather, and the Beasts of Prey, was wisely design'd by the King as a Terror to such abominable flagi∣tious Practices, and to retain the Peo∣ple in their Duty.</P>
<P>The Art of Poysoning is what these <HI>Africans</HI> do very commonly exceed in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Afri∣cans</HI> given to Poisoning</NOTE> and to which they are generally pro∣pense
<PB N="86" REF="52"/>
upon any occasional Quarrel or Abuse. They seldom discover a gene∣rous Resentment by an open Challenge, or disputing it in the Field by the Dint of the Sword, or the force of a Bullet; their dark Complexion inclines them rather to vent their Anger by clande∣stine Courses, to destroy by the swift effects of Poyson, and mortal Infusions of the Juices of Herbs, in which they in∣dustriously acquire a Skill, that in their Designs against a Man's Life, they may be ready and prepared to put their Re∣venge in Execution that way. Their sly and crafty Natures keep them from endeavouring to right themselves at the hazard of a publick Vindication; but that inhumane Rage and Animosity which is excited in them by a prece∣ding Provocation, being commonly ac∣companied with Cowardise and sordid Fear, puts them upon avoiding all Dan∣gers incident to themselves, and con∣triving the Ruin of those they hate, by some covert Method, and after an obscure way. Doing herein what <HI>Asi∣nius Pollio</HI> did to <HI>Plancus,</HI> against whom he writ a Libel, but deferred to publish it, till after his Death, because he was then secure from all sharp Replies.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="52"/>They practise this Diabolical Art with as much Secresie as Skill; so that it is neither easily discern'd when they are about it, nor is it always discover'd by any visible immediate Effects. They qualifie the violent poysonous Qualities with some mitigating Ingredients, and the lurking Operation will by that means sometimes not discover it self in a Month's or a Year's space, as some of our English have affirm'd. Which cautions the more wary <HI>Europeans,</HI> who traffick with these People, from treat∣ing them with any Indecency or Of∣fence, and keeps them always very circumspect and abstemious in eating and drinking with them, lest some un∣known Miscarriage might expose their Lives to their Hatred and Discontents. For they know that all Degrees of An∣ger are least dangerous, when most seen, and then most pernicious when they lurk under a Disguise and dissem∣bled Temper.</P>
<P>This inhuman Practice is not less customary among the <HI>Indians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Indian Wo∣men poison some, and save others that drink together.</NOTE> who by this detestable Vice have been very fa∣tal to the free Conversation of <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> among them.

Punch of <HI>Arak</HI> is the ordinary chearful Entertainment, it too often happens, that the Black Wench, whose constant Employment is the making this Belo∣ved Mixture, will, upon a Disgust, or slight Affront, contrive the Bowl fatal to him that abus'd her, with Safety to all the rest of his Companions. For ha∣ving infus'd the Poison into the Bowl prepared for the Person that offended her, after presenting it to him, she has been often known, when the next was taking it, to dash it all upon the Ground, by a designed, but pretended Inadvertance. And it rarely fails, but that all that taste it for ever quench their Thirst, and seldom long survive the mortal Draught. This is frequent∣ly the effect of the rudeness of unpo∣lish'd Sailers, who shewing a Freedom peculiar to our Northern Nations, but unagreeable to the Niceness of those Eastern Dames, have lavisht away their Lives by a frank innocent Kiss, or railing Expression, and inevitably pe∣risht before they were aware.</P>

For at their first setting out from <HI>England,</HI> a Colony for this Island, the current Report that then prevail'd was, that all the single Persons upon the Island were either Commanders, or Lords Sons, of whom they might have Choice upon their Arrival.

Thus they stept on Shore, full of the Thoughts of a stately Reception, and of the sight of those Gentlemen they had heard so much of. When, alas! all these Blan∣dishments of Fancy, which were so sweet in the Voyage, carried a Sting in the end of them, which imbitter'd all their Joys. For instead of that Hero∣ick Address which they expected from

Men of Wealth and Honour, they were saluted only in the plain Courtship of Men employ'd in Agrieulture, and or∣dinary Mechanick Arts. However, the pleasing Expectation they had, gave them this Advantage over the tedious Passage, that whereas the boisterous Waves and impetuous Winds, the Fu∣ry of the Sea, and the Dangers of Rocks and Sands, are apt to render so long a Voyage very dreadful, their aie∣ry Hopes made them take Courage, and defie the Power of Storms, and gladly encounter all the Perils that at∣tend such a forlorn Passage.</P>

<P>The Women are in some measure servile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Servi∣lity of Wo∣men in the East.</NOTE> and chiefly employ'd in labo∣rious toiling, and in planting the Ground, whilst the Men indulge their Ease, and enjoy the Fruits of it.

We were told of his Know∣ledge in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, which in∣vited us to address to him in our own Dialect, in which likewise he replied and entertained us. His Equipage was very slender, and unsuitable to the Greatness of his Person; for here were no Arms to defend him, his Innocence was his only Guard, and a Tuft of Grass his Chair of State. The Leaves of the Trees were his only Canopy, and the Herbage of the Field was all the Carpet that was spread under him. We had a very free Access to his Pre∣sence, without the usual Formalities of Address, or Punctilio's of approaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Enter∣tainment of us.</NOTE> which prevented all need of a Master of Ceremonies to introduce us.

himself, by inviting us to sit down near him. Now tho' the Accommodation was not extraordinary, 'twas recompens'd however by the Favour of a Royal In∣vitation. The Freedom he had taken with himself, and given to us, made us at first amazed, not expecting to meet with a Person of that Eminence and high Character, much less with such Civilities from him; but they em∣bolden'd and led us on to a little more Assurance, than we could have other∣wise taken in a Prince's Presence. We were doubtful of finding any fit Food,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Enter∣tainment of him.</NOTE> or ready Accommodations for Stran∣gers among the Natives, and there∣fore brought with us a little homely Diet of Bread and Cheese, which we humbly offer'd to his Princely Conde∣scentions to taste, and partake of: For we found that Ceremonies were not much in Fashion, by his plain and un∣affected Appearance, by his familiar Admission of us to seat our selves near him upon the Ground, which we thought encouragement enough for our offering this ordinary Refection. The making Cheese or Butter is an Art,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little Houswifery in this place.</NOTE> which his People have not yet attain'd

The Natives, after the loss of their Ship at Sea, received them all very

kindly, condoled their Misfortune, and supplied their Exigencies with a Generosity extraordinary. One of the <HI>English</HI> was honoured with a piece of Silk from the Bounty of the Queen, and was offer'd by her Directions Diet and Lodging while he pleased. Their Cordial Affection to the <HI>English</HI> readily kindled their Liberality, that was ex∣pressed without Reluctance, or any signs of a repining Humour, and is in∣creased into so dear and intimate a Kindness, that 'tis a common Proverb now among them, <HI>Johanna-man, English-man,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Proverb at <HI>Johan∣na.</HI></NOTE> <HI>all one.</HI></P>

But above all Nations they have the least Friendship for the <HI>Danes:</HI> For a large <HI>Danish</HI> Ship touching here at such a time, as they were sore infested by a

But the <HI>Danes</HI> vanquisht their Expectations, instead of conquering their Enemies; and instead of putting them to flight, fled themselves with both their Men and Money, so that to this Day they were never heard of.

made strong by Stone-Walls and Tim∣ber Roofs. The former is the usual Residence of their Kings, where they keep their Court, at 25 Miles distance from the Harbour. The Inhabitants of this place enjoy some peculiar Pri∣vileges above the rest of the Natives of the Island, because of their being seated so near the Royal Palace, which defends them from those Injuries to which those that dwell at a Distance are sometimes exposed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King Arbitrary.</NOTE>They are all of them industrious in concealing their Wealth from the no∣tice of their Prince, whose Avarice and Injustice cause all their Goods and E∣states to be seised to his own proper Use, when they die; whereby many times the Widow and Children are re∣duced to the lowest state of Misery, when once the Natural Death of the Husband has made the King Heir to his Wealth and Fortune. Which is an Oppression very unjustifiable even a∣mong the Mahometan Princes, and those Arbitrary Governours of the East; but could never be bore with any Pa∣tience, by a People secur'd in their E∣states by the same Laws with those

<P>In <HI>Queens Town,</HI> which is a Mari∣time Village, many of their finest Houses stand uninhabited, almost half of them, because some of the People were formerly killed in them by the Islanders of <HI>Moheila,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Causes that many Houses stand un∣inhabited.</NOTE> and their Blood∣shed polluted the Habitation. The Death of the Master and Mistress, and one or two more of the Family, does the same; as if they mistrusted, that upon the Destruction of the Root, the Natural Branches would, without a Transplantation, wither and decay. And the Death of any Person whatso∣ever so far defiles the Purity of the Dwelling, that it hinders the Dressing of any Meat there for the next Month or two succeeding.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Large En∣tertain∣ments.</NOTE>The Entertainments prepar'd by the King, and those of the best Note, are very large and hospitable, at which a whole Town will be at one time treat∣ed, and all the Inhabitants invited as Guests.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strong Drink for∣bidden.</NOTE>Strong Drink is not so much their Aversion, as Restraint, being kept from it by their Obedience to the Mahome∣tan Law, contrary to their eager De∣sires. Yet here, as in places more Ori∣ental, they warm their Spirits by the smoaking of Tobacco; and Beetle∣nut and Chinam are very rarely out of their Mouths.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beetle-nut.</NOTE> Beetle-nut fortifies the Stomach, and comforts the Brain; it preserves the Teeth, and cures or prevents a tainted Breath.

These they take and chaw between their Teeth, till they squeeze out their Moi∣sture, which is spit upon the Ground. Upon this two effects follow. First, It leaveth a red Tincture upon the Teeth and Lips, which is esteem'd with them very Ornamental; and then it chears and heats their Spirits, even almost to the Intoxication of such as are unaccu∣stom'd to it. Thus they commute for the use of our prohibited Wines. The Rheum which is hereby raised in the Mouth, is spit generally into a Hole in the Room, design'd for that purpose, which serves instead of a Pigdan, or Spitting-pot. The Floor where the Prince entertain'd us was so uneven and full of these Holes, as if the whole Room had been contriv'd for that pur∣pose.</P>
<P>In the middle of <HI>Queens-Town</HI> is a Mosque daily frequented by the Peo∣ple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mosque.</NOTE> into which we were admitted with this necessary Respect of putting off our Shoes upon the entrance into it.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="71"/>But this was an Instance of Civility rarely allowed us Infidels by the Ma∣hometans. Near the Porch of the Mosque is a Draw-well for the wash∣ing the Hands, Face, and Feet, of all that enter, or come out of it. They take Care to preserve it neat and clean, with Mats spread upon the Floor for the Convenience of such Men as pray, for the Women are not much con∣cern'd to frequent it. In repeating their private Prayers they make use of Beads, as the Romanists do, and com∣monly with the same neglect, inter∣mixing their Secular Conference with the handling of them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Women married young.</NOTE>The Women are Courted sometimes at Seven or Eight Years old, and mar∣ried when they come to Maturity, which is about Eleven or Twelve in these warmer Countreys; at which time they prepare a publick Feast for the space of Seven Days, as they do at their Funerals, and entertain all that are pleas'd to come.</P>

from the Society of Strangers, and that freedom of gadding abroad; which they so eagerly desire, which they sometimes unlawfully venture upon, to the hazard of their Lives upon Disco∣very. The Orientals are all of them generally jealous, and very circum∣spect about their Wives; and seldom fail of punishing their Infidelity, if it come to light. And particularly, the Laws of <HI>Tunquin</HI> are very severe against Adulteresses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A severe Law a∣gainst A∣dulteresses at <HI>Tun∣quin,</HI> and at <HI>Japan.</HI></NOTE> who upon Conviction are cast to an Elephant bred up for that purpose, who tosseth them in the Air with his Trunk as long as he finds any Life in them.

<P>They make great Lamentations at the Death of their Friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Burial and mour∣ning Appa∣rel.</NOTE> for whose Sepulture they have no particular pla∣ces set apart, but lay them often any where in the Fields.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Devil's frequent appearing.</NOTE>Their Idea's of Religion are very dark and superstitious, increas'd in them by the constant Apprehensions of the Devil's frequent appearance among them. They give him here the Name of <HI>Gregory,</HI> and affirm, that they often meet him in the High-ways, and in the Streets, and in the Evenings especially, by the Water-side. The Dread of him confines them to their Houses when it thunders, for then they say <HI>Gregory</HI> is abroad, and no Mortal dare stir out of his Dwelling. As the City of <HI>London</HI> had a Custom of burning the Pope every Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The burn∣ing of the Devil.</NOTE> so here they commonly
<PB N="127" REF="72"/>
burn the Devil.

<P>Before we espyed the Main of <HI>India,</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="74"/>
several Snakes of different sizes came swimming round our Ship near the sur∣face of the Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Snakes seen at Sea, a to∣ken of the nearness of Land.</NOTE> by which we knew we were not far from Land, because they are never seen at any great di∣stance from the shore; they were wash∣ed from it, I presume, by the violence of the Rains in the times of the <HI>Mus∣souns,</HI> which I shall afterwards describe. This was seconded by another sign of our approaching the Land, <HI>viz.</HI> by a multitude of Locusts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Locusts lighting up∣on our Ship at Sea.</NOTE> which came fly∣ing upon our Masts and Yards, when we were distant from it Thirty Leagues, as we found by our Com∣putation afterwards. They were a∣bove two Inches in length, and their reaching us at that distance from the Shore, argued their great strength of Wing to flie to us so very far; by which they mounted aloft, after they had rested themselves a while, and took their Flight directly upwards. While I was at <HI>Suratt,</HI> the President and some more of us observ'd for seve∣ral succeeding Nights, an Infinite num∣ber of these Creatures Flying over our Heads for several hours together, in such numerous Armies and vast Bodies,

<P>It was just the Season of the <HI>Mus∣souns</HI> when we fell upon the Coast of <HI>India,</HI> which generally is extreme dan∣gerous, because they break out for the most part in such Thunder and Rains, and impetuous Winds, that if the Ships are not laid up and in Harbour before that time, they incur the hazad of be∣ing lost.

the Danger was well spent, and the joy of our Safety commenc'd about the same time that the fear of our Ship wrack did begin, according to the Ma∣xim and Observation among Mariners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Obser∣vation of Sea-men.</NOTE> <HI>That a Tempest ceases about the same time generally that it does arise.</HI> And because I am fallen upon this Subject, I shall, before I enter any farther upon <HI>Bombay,</HI> give a brief Account of the Nature of these <HI>Mussouns</HI> in <HI>India.</HI></P>

The whole Hemisphere then is most

sullenly Dark, and the Sky over-cast with the thickest weighty Clouds, so that the Earth seems rather inclosed within a huge Ocean of Water, than only a few watry Clouds, whose black and lowring Aspect is so very melan∣choly, that it gives the fairest repre∣sentation imaginable of the terrours of a second universal Deluge. Sometimes in Three or Four Hours time, such Showers fall from these full Clouds, that the Currents run along the Streets, swelled to that height, that they are scare fordable on Horse-back.

Indeed, whether it be that the Air stagnates, for the Land towards the Fort lies very low, or the stinking of the Fish which was used to be applied to the Roots of the Trees, instead of Dung; or whatever other Cause it is which renders it so very unhealthful, 'tis certainly a mortal Enemy to the Lives of the <HI>Europeans.</HI> And as the Ancients gave the Epithet of <HI>Fortunate</HI> to some Islands in the West, because of their Delightfulness and Health; so the Modern may, in opposition to them, denominate this the <HI>Ʋnfortunate</HI>

<P>We arrived here (as I hinted before) at the beginning of the Rains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Above <HI>35</HI> buried out of the Ship in less than <HI>4</HI> months.</NOTE> and bu∣ried of the Twenty Four Passengers which we brought with us, above Twenty, before they were ended; and of our own Ship's Company above Fifteen: And had we stay'd till the end of the next Month, <HI>October,</HI> the rest would have undergone a very hazar∣dous Fate, which by a kind Providence ordering our Ship for <HI>Suratt</HI>'s River-mouth, was comfortably avoided. A fortunate Escape indeed! because nei∣ther the Commander, nor my self, were in any Hopes of surviving many Days: neither Temperance, the most Sove∣reign Medicine, nor the safest Prescrip∣tions in the Physical Art, could restore the Weakness of our languishing de∣cay'd Natures. And that which tho∣roughly confirm'd to us the unhealth∣fulness of the place we had lately loosed from, was the sudden Desertion of our Diseases, and return of Health,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The health∣fulness of a good Air.</NOTE> before half the Voyage to <HI>Suratt</HI> was finisht: In the middle of which Passage we manifestly perceiv'd in our Bodies as

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Invita∣tion for the Author to stay here.</NOTE>The Deputy-Governour, Mr. <HI>George Cook,</HI> a pleasant and obliging Gentle∣man, sollicited me upon the account of my Function to reside with him upon <HI>Bombay,</HI> and invited me with all the Proposals of a frank and generous Civi∣lity, to wave my Voyage, and con∣tinue with him there, because they were then destitute of a Minister. And indeed the Deference I bore to such kind Expressions, and to the Duty of my Calling, were invincible Arguments for my Stay, had I not been satisfied of the immediate infallible sad Fate I was under, like that of my Predeces∣sors; one of whom was interred a Fortnight before this time, and three or four more had been buried the prece∣ding Years: Which common Fatality has created a Proverb among the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An English Proverb at <HI>Bombay.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Two Mussouns are the Age of a Man.</HI> This is much lamented by the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, and puts them upon great Expences for supplying the Island with fresh Men, in the room of

<P>But there seldom happens any great Defect in the Natural World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great wickedness that reign∣ed upon the Island.</NOTE> without some preceding in the Moral; and the Springs of our Miseries and Misfor∣tunes rise higher than meerly from Se∣cond Causes. For I cannot without Horror mention to what a Pitch all vi∣cious Enormities were grown in this place, when the Infection was most outragious; nor can I but think that the Divine Justice interposed, and for∣warded these fatal Infelicities, which are not wholy imputable to an impure Contagion of the Air, or the gross In∣fection of the Elements. These were made use of as Fatal Instruments of the direful Excision, but the true Cause of the Malady lay deeper. Their Prin∣ciples of Action, and the consequent evil Practices of the <HI>English</HI> forwarded their Miseries, and contributed to fill the Air with those pestilential Vapours that seized their Vitals, and speeded their hasty passage to the other World.
<PB N="144" REF="81"/>
Luxury, Immodesty, and a prostitute Dissolution of Manners, found still new Matter to work upon. Wickedness was still upon the Improvement, and grew to such a Perfection, that no Vice was so detestable as not to be extreme∣ly vicious; whereby Satan obtain'd a more Despotick Authorty in the Hearts of the Christians, than he did among the Gentiles in the Pageantry of Heathen Worship. And when the Seeds of Avarice and Prophaneness, of Envy and Injustice, and a thousand o∣ther black Infernal Vices grew up and flourish'd, and were made the Ambiti∣on of every Individual; we need not then admire, if the pure Luminaries of Heaven should set themselves against their Impieties, and dart their mortal Poysons on the Earth; if the Planets should wisely shed their venomous A∣spects upon profligate Men, and there∣by in Vengeance produce the mortal Fruits of Death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vermin and Veno∣mous Creatures very large.</NOTE>The Prodigious growth of Vermin, and of venomous Creatures, at the time of the <HI>Mussouns,</HI> do abundantly like∣wise demonstrate the malignant Cor∣ruption of the Air, and the natural

Cause of its direful Effects upon the <HI>Eu∣ropeans.</HI> For Spiders here increase their Bulk ot the largeness of a Man's Thumb, and Toads are not of a much less size than a small Duck; whereby 'tis easily seen by these venomous Crea∣tures, what encouragement these infe∣ctious and pestilential Qualities meet with in this place, and under what a contagious Influence all the Inhabitants must consequently be seated. This in∣duc'd a Gentleman one time in the Go∣vernours and my Company, and some other Persons of Note, to affirm, that he believ'd it rain'd Frogs; because he espied upon his Hat small Frogs, a∣bout the bigness of the end of one's Finger, when he was at a great di∣stance from any House or Covering, from whence they might drop.</P>
<P>All Wounds and Contusions in the Flesh are likewise very rarely healed here; and if they are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wounds hardly cu∣red.</NOTE> 'tis with Diffi∣culty and extraordinary Care; they happen generally to be very dangerous, and the Cure admits of more Delays and Hazards in the healing, than what is usual in other parts.

But so very few of their Children live, and of those that do, so many of them are sent for <HI>England,</HI> that fresh Colonies from thence are very necessary for support∣ing the Government and Affairs of the Island. A Modish Garb and Mien is all that is expected from any Women that pass thither, who are many times match'd to the chief Merchants upon the place, and advance thereby their Conditions to a very happy pitch.

<P>The Island lies in about Nineteen Degrees North, in which is a Fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort.</NOTE> which is the Defence of it, flanked and Lined according to the Rules of Art, and secured with many Pieces of Ordi∣nance, which command the Harbour and the parts adjoining.

<P><PB N="148" REF="84"/>The Island is likewise beautified with several elegant Dwellings of the <HI>English,</HI> and neat Apartments of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> to whom is permitted the free Exercise of their Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liberty of Religion.</NOTE> and the Liberty of erecting publick Chappels of Devotion; which as yet the <HI>English</HI> have not attain'd to, because the War with the <HI>Mogul</HI> interrupts the finishing of a stately Structure which was going on for their publick Church. For want of this a particular Room is set apart in the Fort for Publick Service twice a day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Prayers twice a day.</NOTE> at which all are en∣joyn'd to be present; and for perfor∣mance of which, and other Sacred Of∣fices, a Salary of an 100 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> annually, besides the convenience of Diet and Lodging, is allowed to the Minister by the Company.</P>
<P>The Gentiles too, as well as Chri∣stians, are permitted the Freedom of their Religion, and conniv'd at in their Heathen Worship. I accidentally once entred into one of the Gentiles Chap∣pels, but durst not stay for fear of di∣sturbing the <HI>Bramin</HI> with the Visit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A small Pagod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> The smallness of it would scarce ad∣mit of above Nine or Ten to enter in∣to

On the right side of this Image hung a small Purse for the Peoples Oblations; on the left, very near it, lay some burnt Rice, which the Bramin had sacrificed; and at the entrance of the Door stood a Trumpet, which sounded all the while he was a sacrificing.</P>
<P>The Island by the War with the <HI>Mogul</HI> was much Depopulated and Im∣poverished,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The War with the <HI>Mogul.</HI></NOTE> both by destroying the <HI>English</HI> Inhabitants, and wasting the Fruit of the ground, especially of the Coco-Trees, whose Nuts are the sta∣ple Income upon it. And whatever the Original of this unhappy War was in other places, or upon what other Grounds soever it was commenced here, the <HI>English</HI> had some just Cause of murmuring and Complaint,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Seve∣rity of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Officers to the English at <HI>Suratt.</HI></NOTE> from the Treatment they had from the <HI>Mo∣gul</HI>'s Officers at <HI>Suratt,</HI> very differnet from what they might in Reason and Equity expect. For at the first settling a Factory there, it was agreed upon
<PB N="150" REF="85"/>
between the great <HI>Mogul</HI> and our Pre∣sident, to have a permission of free Trade for Two and an half <HI>per Cent.</HI> for all Goods Imported or Exported; which were without any Reason arbi∣trarily advanced to Four <HI>per Cent.</HI> be∣yond the Bounds of the first Agree∣ment. And upon this very occasion the late Honourable President <HI>Bartho∣lomew Harris</HI> has urged to me often this Case, that he thought it no Inju∣stice to evade the payment of as much Customs for the <HI>English</HI> Goods, as they were injur'd in them above two and an half <HI>per Cent.</HI> by the <HI>Mogul.</HI> But this was not the only Severity the <HI>English</HI> were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another instance of their Se∣verity.</NOTE> and still are treated with; but before the Eruption of this last War, the very Plate Gold Buttons which the chief Fa∣ctors wore upon their Cloaths, were demanded to be paid Custom for, as often as they cross'd the River of <HI>Su∣ratt.</HI> This, to the Purser Marine par∣ticularly, was insufferable, whose Em∣ployment engages him frequently at <HI>Sualy,</HI> to which he must always pass the River; inasmuch as in a short time the very Intrinsick Value of his Gold Buttons would be spent in Custom.
<PB N="151" REF="85"/>
And we are all sensible how hard these violent Despotick Proceedings bear upon <HI>English</HI> Spirits, totally unac∣custom'd to such Servility, and bless'd with such Paternal Constitutions, as appoint the meanest Subject Absolute Monarch of his petty Free-hold, ex∣empt from all Impositions, but what are voted by the Assembly of the whole Kingdom, in its Representatives.</P>
<P>These, with other things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siddy</HI> landing upon <HI>Bom∣bay.</HI></NOTE> made a Rupture; and after some small Di∣sputes at Sea, at which the <HI>Indians</HI> are never vigorous, the <HI>Mogul</HI> attempts the sending a Land-Army upon <HI>Bombay,</HI> whose <HI>Siddy</HI> or General having receiv'd Intelligence of Sir <HI>John Wyburn</HI>'s Death, who was Governour of <HI>Bombay,</HI> and a Man bred to War, immediately prepares to land his Men upon the Island, and storm the Fort, and totally rout the <HI>English</HI> upon it. For now the <HI>Siddy</HI> expected great Success in his At∣tempts, because he challeng'd our Ge∣neral at that Weapon, in which he knew he was not skilled. Sir <HI>John Child,</HI> who was bred a Merchant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>John Child</HI> un∣fit for a General.</NOTE> and created Baronet-by the King, and ap∣pointed General of the <HI>English</HI> Forces
<PB N="152" REF="86"/>
in <HI>India</HI> by the Company, was, he knew, a General, but no Souldier; and better skilled at his Pen, than his Sword; and more expert at casting an Account, than in martialling and conducting an Army.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His negle∣cting to for∣tifie the Island.</NOTE> And accordingly, his neglect of fortifying the Island till the <HI>Siddy</HI> was upon it, tho the Company had frequent∣ly requir'd it from him, and his vain Ex∣pressions, <HI>That he would bring the</HI> Mogul <HI>to consent to his Proposals of Peace, and blow the</HI> Siddy <HI>off the Island, if he ever came up∣on it;</HI> were all inconsistent Frailties with his station, whose Province and Employ∣ment would have looked with a better Character, had he foreseen the Danger to which the Island was exposed, and timely applied his Prevention. But the Merchant was unfit for that great Post, and grew unweildy with too much Ho∣nour. The <HI>Siddy</HI> therefore in the Year 1688. landed with an Army of Twen∣ty Five Thousand Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siddy</HI> was Ten to One.</NOTE> to encounter which the General commanded only Twenty Five Hundred; so that the Enemy was just Ten to One.

<PB N="153" REF="86"/>
such Vigour, that for some Months they were unable to approach the Fort, though they landed not very far from it. The <HI>English</HI> were bouyed up with a strong Opinion of their own Valour, and of the <HI>Indians</HI> Pufillanimity, which carried them on to such bold Adven∣tures, that they promised themselves Victory in the most dubious Engage∣ments; and had they not been be∣tray'd by Renegades, who discover'd their Weakness, and smallness of their Numbers, might have hoped to have repelled that numerous Host, with that weak Force they had to resist them. But the Enemy being taught th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Art of mineing, and sheltering themselves in their Trenches and Bas∣ket-works, (which they learnt from the Deserters) came at length so near, that they Bombarded our Fort with massie Stones instead of Iron Bullets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Large stones in∣stead of Bullets.</NOTE> whilst our Shot from thence was scarce able to annoy them, they were so defended by the Moulds they had cast up. Our Fort was well flanked with Bastions, having the Sea on one side, and encom∣passed on the other with a broad and deep Ditch, and had mounted on all

sides very large Guns: But the Decay of Powder and Ammunition, which the constant Firing had produced, and the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Army close investing of the Fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Peace concluded.</NOTE> made it advisable in our General to think on a Peace, which was in a little time concluded upon; upon which the <HI>Siddy</HI> left the Island.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gene∣ral's Death</NOTE>The General, before the Terms of Accommodation were agreed upon, dies; by a too deep Concern, as its presum'd, for suffering the <HI>Siddy</HI> to in∣vade the Island; and for fear that such Proposals in a Firmaun as might suit with the Honour of his Masters the <HI>East India</HI> Company, might not be hearkned to by the <HI>Mogul.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Skill in Mer∣chandize.</NOTE> He was a quick and expert Merchant, and to∣tally devoted to his Masters Service: Tho' the Factors in <HI>India</HI> charge him with Partiality to his Relations, in ad∣vancing them to Stations above their standing, to the Prejudice of those who were their Seniors, and better qualified for such Promotions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exclaim'd against by the Factors</NOTE> They accuse him likewise of a penurious Temper, and injuriously depriving them of the Com∣fort of <HI>Europe</HI> Liquors, which the Company's Bounty yearly bestowed,

<P><PB N="156" REF="88"/>I shall remark but one thing to en∣tertain the Reader, and conclude this part of my Discourse. As he whose Title is <HI>most Christian,</HI> encouraged him who is its principal Adversary to in∣vade the Rights of Christendom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The treach∣erous deal∣ings of a Je∣suite with the <HI>English</HI></NOTE> so did Senior Padre <HI>de Pandara,</HI> the principal Jesuite in an adjacent Island to <HI>Bombay,</HI> invite the <HI>Siddy</HI> to exterminate all the Protestants there. To facilitate which pious Design, he allowed the <HI>Siddy</HI>'s Army all the Revenues belonging to himself to aid and support the Work that was to be carried on. But with this Proviso, that when the <HI>English</HI> were beaten off, their Possessions, and of all the Churches belonging to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> should be restor'd to him, for his own Benefit and Use. This <HI>Pa∣dre</HI> likewise, when the <HI>Siddy</HI> had inva∣ded the Island, plentifully supplied his want of Provisions, and with great Li∣berality took Care to have them sea∣sonably convey'd to him and his Army. But the <HI>Siddy</HI> being beaten off, these and such other perfidious Actions have forfeited all the Right of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to those Lands and Estates, which the Favour and Civility of the <HI>English</HI> al∣lowed
<PB N="157" REF="88"/>
them to enjoy upon the Island; and therefore this <HI>Padre</HI> and his Asso∣ciates are more likely to suffer a dissei∣zing of what they had, than the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> as they design'd. This breeds no small Heat and Fury in the Breasts of the turbulent Jesuites, who upon this have rais'd some strong Commotions; it has excited their Revenge, and makes them sometimes threaten in a passionate Rage the retaking of their Lands by Force. Few Men can enjoy very peaceable Lives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jesu∣ites grow∣ing Power in <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> who have any fair Pos∣sessions near the Convents of these men: For even in the <HI>Indies</HI> they have gain'd that Ascendant over the Tempers and Estates of the People, that a pleasant Seat, and a fruitful Plantation, can hard∣ly escape their gaining: Which renders that Society a Burden insupportable to all the rest of that Religion, who are seated there. The Incomes of that Church, whereof this <HI>Padre</HI> is chief, shews in some measure their growing Wealth; for they are said to amount to the value of a Pound of Gold a Day.</P>

<P>But that which adds the most Re∣markable Character to this Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Famous <HI>Pagode</HI> described.</NOTE> is the fam'd <HI>Pagode</HI> at the top of it; so much spoke of by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and at present admir'd by the present Queen Dowager, that she cannot think any one has seen this part of <HI>India,</HI> who comes not Freighted home with some Account of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Deri∣vation of <HI>Pagode.</HI></NOTE> A <HI>Pagode</HI> is the Heathens Temple, or a place Dedica∣ted to the Worship of their False Gods, and borrows its Name from the <HI>Per∣sian</HI> Word <HI>Pout,</HI> which signifies Idol; thence <HI>Pout Gheda,</HI> a Temple of False Gods, and from thence, <HI>Pagode.</HI></P>
<P>At the Ascent of an High Hill upon this Island <HI>Elephanta,</HI> is therefore a ve∣ry large <HI>Indian Pagode,</HI> cut out of the very Heart of a hard Rock, whose Di∣mensions are about an Hundred and Twenty Foot Square, and in Height
<PB N="160" REF="91"/>
about Eighteen; besides several Out-Rooms appertaining and adjoining to it. At sixteen Foot distance from one a∣nother are sixteen Pillars of Stone, Cut out with much Art and Ingenuity, whose Diameters are three Foot and an half, design'd as it were for the Support of this weighty Building, whose Roof is a lofty Broad Rock. Out of the sides of this <HI>Pagode,</HI> thus Beautified with these lovely Columns and curious Arches, are Figures of For∣ty or Fifty Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Variety of strange Fi∣gures.</NOTE> each of them Twelve or Fifteen Foot High, in just and ex∣act Symetry, according to the Dimen∣sions of their various Statures. Of these Gigantick Figures, some had six Arms, and others three Heads, and o∣thers of such vast Monstrosity, that their very Fingers were larger than an ordinary Man's Leg. Upon some of their Heads were Ornamental Crowns, neat and Artificially wrought, whilst others near them held Scepters in their Hands, and above the Heads of others are multitudes of little People repre∣sented in a posture of Devotion; some I observ'd leaning upon Women, and others upon the Head of a Cow, an

Animal most venerable in <HI>India.</HI> Here are some taking an Amiable Charm∣ing Lady by the Chin, and there the horrid Prospect of others hewing in pieces little Children; and generally above the Heads of all, are abundance of diminutive Folk hovering in the Air, represented with chearful Aspects, and in lively Figures. This variety of pleasant and monstrous Images, I lookt upon as no other than the seve∣ral Objects of the Gentiles Worship, as each Adorer's Fancy led him to his several God, either of Terror or De∣light.</P>
<P>There is nothing of Beauty in the Frontispiece of this <HI>Pagode,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hea∣thens Fan∣cy concern∣ing Giants.</NOTE> or of Or∣nament at the Entrance into it. The Figures of these Gigantick Men, to which the Heathen have paid a pro∣found Veneration, and Reverenc'd as Heroes or Demi-Gods formerly, (for this Island is at present in the Possession of the <HI>Potuguese</HI>) are the representation of the first Race of Mortals, which, according to the Account of their Chronicles, were all Gyants, but dwind∣led by degrees into lesser proportions, and at length, thro' the degeneracy of
<PB N="162" REF="92"/>
Manners, which caused an Universal decay of Humane Nature, they shrunk into these small proportions in which they appear now in the World. So that the present smallness of our Sta∣ture, according to them, derives its de∣clension and Decay from the Excess of Vice, and the small remains of Vertue that are left. And because the Form∣ing of a Temple out of such hard Matter, requir'd Incredible endless Pains, therefore they would Insinuate that these Giants here expressed, were only capable of such Performances, which seem now to exceed that ordi∣nary strength we have now to go thro' with such a Work.</P>

scarce resisted, because he had fitted his Ship for a close Fight, and therefore withdrawing his Men from the Decks, prepared them with small Fire-Arms, and put the Powder Chests in order, on purpose to receive them. The <HI>San∣ganians,</HI> who fancied all their own easie Purchase, were so warmly entertain'd, that as soon as they entered, they were repulsed, and speedily withdrew, be∣taking themselves to the Water, to e∣vade the fury of the Fire on Board.</P>
<P>In a little time we happily arriv'd at <HI>Sualy-bar,</HI> and the Tide serving,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sualy.</NOTE> came to an Anchor very near the <HI>Shoar.</HI> Here the <HI>Europe</HI> Ships are permitted to ride, but no <HI>Indian</HI> Vessel is allowed that freedom, they are ei∣ther all of them to enter the River of <HI>Suratt,</HI> or to Anchor at the Mouth of it; which is distant from <HI>Sualy</HI> two Leagues, as <HI>Sualy</HI> is from <HI>Suratt</HI> four.

The <HI>Roman</HI> Histories inform us, that while that People was Just and Temperate, and Religious Ob∣servers of their Laws, their Empire was establisht in its Glory, and Success at∣tended their Arms and Designs. And concerning the <HI>Chinese</HI> History, 'tis affirm'd to us, that Virtue alone form∣ed that great Empire, and that nothing concurr'd to its Confirmation more than the Virtuous Lives of their Em∣perours; in so much that Forty four Kings enamour'd with the Virtue of <HI>Venvam,</HI> submitted to his Laws.

and obliged by a natural Tenderness and Compassion to the mutual Offices of Humanity and Love. For divest∣ing themselves of these Principles, and being whetted with an innate Ambiti∣on for Empire and Command, and led by the in-bred Laws of Self-preserva∣tion, they persue their Claims to the Royal Dignity, either by open Vio∣lence, or secret Machinations, by pri∣vate Treachery, or publick Hostility; not sparing the slaughter of their Bre∣thren, or whomever else they find Can∣didates, or Pretenders to the Crown. This is the Inhumane method pursu'd not only by the <HI>Ottaman,</HI> but <HI>Indian</HI> Kings, from which <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> did not decline, in his Cruel and Treacherous Ascent to the Throne For his Father <HI>Cha-Jehan</HI> he Imprison'd, till he died: The Head of his Eldest Brother, <HI>Dara∣cha,</HI> he commanded to be cut off; his second Brother, <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> he put to Flight, who was slain in his Retire∣ment; and his youngest Brother, <HI>Mo∣rad-Bache</HI> had the same ill Fate with the Eldest, was Beheaded too.

But if we may measure our Opinions by his,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His state-Maxim.</NOTE> and the Maxims he has laid down for Empire, his proceedings will not appear so very black and criminal, since he has perswaded him∣self that Princes are exempt from seve∣ral of those Laws which bind their Subjects, and that Soveraign Heads are not so severely Accountable for the Ju∣stice of their Actions, as the inferiour rank of Men. As if the despotick So∣veraignty he exercis'd on Earth,

above what he weighed the preceding Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Weigh∣ing of the <HI>Mogul,</HI></NOTE> this adds excess of Mirth and Joy to the Solemnity; but if he prove lighter in the Scales, this diminishes their Triumphs, and damps their chear∣ful Entertainments.

For all the Lands of <HI>Indoston</HI> belonging intirely to the <HI>Mogul,</HI> the <HI>Omrahs</HI> there cannot derive their Titles from their Earldoms, Lordships, or Mansion-Hou∣ses (as with us) because they are none of their Propriety, only Tenants at will, during the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s pleasure; and there∣fore the <HI>Mogul</HI> confers upon them such Names of Dignity, as by their personal Conduct or Accomplishment he thinks they merit. And as he bestows Titles proper to his Generals, of <HI>Invincible,</HI> or <HI>Victorious;</HI> so to his <HI>Nabobs,</HI> or Gover∣nours, he bethinks himself of Names suitable to their Stations, or his Opini∣on of their Excellencies and Endow∣ments.

<P>The dependance upon the Prince's Favour makes Obsequiousness fashion∣able,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The flattery of the <HI>East∣ern</HI> Sub∣jects.</NOTE> and Flattery practis'd in all the Courts of the <HI>East:</HI> So that tho' they require an account of their Affairs, and expect to be informed; yet they think it a diminution to their Grandeur, to be acquainted with any thing that may disgust, or told any thing that looks displeasing. Except among the <HI>Chinese,</HI> with whom the liberty of Ad∣monishing their Emperour was esta∣blished by a Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The free∣dom used by the K. of <HI>China</HI>'s Subjects with him.</NOTE> which impowred them to use importunate Applications to him upon any failure, and caus'd them instantly to remind him of taking care of his Life and Actions, and that the virtuous Pattern of his Royal Be∣haviour, was the best and only method for deriving Justice, Integrity, and Loyalty upon his Magistrates and People. They likewise admonished him, that if he deviated from the transcen∣dant Virtues of his Ancestors, his Sub∣jects would inevitably digress from their Duties of Allegiance and Fidelity to him. For it is a receiv'd Maxim a∣mong
<PB N="182" REF="103"/>
those People, <HI>That the Subjects are like Ears of Corn, wherewith a Field is cover'd, and the Morals of their Em∣perour are like a Wind, which inclines them which way it pleaseth.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Indian</HI> Emperours are incon∣troulable in what they say, as well as in their Actions; so far, that it is an al∣lowed Maxim in this Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Court Flat∣tery.</NOTE> <HI>That if they say at Noon-day it is Night, you are to answer, Behold the Moon and the Stars!</HI> This flattery of their Subjects has made them fancy themselves more than De∣mi-Gods, and vaunt themselves in the most exorbitant swelling Titles.

Thus the present <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Father stiled himself <HI>Cha-Jehan, i. e.</HI> King of the World: and the Name of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> imports the Ornament of the Throne; are no less Extravagant than the rest, they are these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Titles of the K. of <HI>Bisnagar.</HI></NOTE> The Husband of good Fortune, the God of great Provinces,

King of the greatest Kings, the Lord of Horsemen, the Master of them which cannot speak, Emperour of three Empe∣rours, Conqueror of all he sees, and Keeper of all he Conquers, Dread∣ful to the Eight Coasts of the World, Vanquisher of the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and Lord of the <HI>East, West, North, South,</HI> and of the Sea, which now Ruleth and Governeth this World.</P>
<P>Thus they exalt their Pomp and Vani∣ty by these proud and Swelling Titles, and expect there an Obeysance little less than of Adoration from their Sub∣jects and Adressors. The <HI>Tailim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Indian</HI> Salutations</NOTE> or deep <HI>Salem,</HI> which is the usual Salu∣tation to the <HI>Mogul,</HI> is, First to kiss the Ground with the Hand, then to touch the Breast with it, and afterwards raise it to the Head; and all this thrice re∣peated, when any person approaches his Imperial Presence. The ordinary <HI>Indian</HI> Salute, is only the lifting up of the Hand to the Fore-Head, and if it be to a Person of Eminence or Supe∣riority, to bend the Head too when 'tis touched. The <HI>Salem</HI> of the Religious <HI>Bramins,</HI> is to join their Hands together, and spreading them first, make a mo∣tion
<PB N="184" REF="104"/>
towards their Head, and then stretch them out; and the <HI>Salem</HI> of greatest Respect, is to take hold of the Feet, and touch them with their Head; and if this is occasion'd by the commit∣ting of some Offence, laying the Hands upon the Supplicant's Back is a sign of Pardon; and the Offender generally holds fast the Feet, till he feels it upon his Back. The <HI>Chineses</HI> give their Prince nine Prostrations, accounting that Number sacred and lucky.

<P>The vast Tract of Land to which this large Empire is extended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The extent of <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> reaches near 2000 Miles in length, some say more; which makes it necessary for the <HI>Mogul,</HI> whose Territories are so large, to employ a numerous Army to awe his Infinite multitude of People, and keep them in an absolute Subjection.

For hoping to retrieve their Li∣berty, and regain the Kingdoms they have lost, they often declare for a <HI>Ra∣jah,</HI> which is a Native <HI>Indian</HI> Prince, and stand by him till the <HI>Mogul</HI> over-powers their Forces, defeats their Re∣bellion, stints their Progress, and re∣duces them to a tame Obedience again. So that one while the <HI>Mogul</HI> comes upon a City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mise∣rable lives of the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> in some parts.</NOTE> and demands the Contri∣bution of so many Thousand Gold Moors, or else he threatens the Rase∣ing its Foundations, Pillaging the Hou∣ses, and converting them into Smoak and Flames. When he is retreated,
<PB N="187" REF="105"/>
the <HI>Rajah</HI>'s Army flies upon them with Fury and Hunger, and storms their Towns, and threatens them with Fire and Sword as their inevitable Fate, if they offer to delay the pay∣ment of so many thousand Gold Rou∣pies more. Or if these formidable Threats are not listned to, they take that by Rapine, which was civilly de∣manded, ravage the Country, and load themselves with Plunder and Spoil. Which makes Fear and Distress, Poverty and Famine the universal Air and Genius of those unquiet Abodes. This was the unhappy condition of <HI>Su∣ratt,</HI> An. 1664. when <HI>Rajah Sivagy</HI> plundred it for Forty Days together, carried off in Gold, Silver, and Jewels an Infinite Sum, without sparing any part of it, but the Habitations of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> and the Castle, who defended themselves with their Ca∣non.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Conquest of one part of the Kingdom is the loss of another, for that <HI>Rajah</HI> who without reluctancy submitted to the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Power, while his Camp was near, immediately dis∣claims it, when he knows it at a di∣stance;
<PB N="188" REF="106"/>
which Commotions bring on the <HI>Mogul</HI> endless Troubles and Ex∣pence.</P>
<P>A mighty <HI>Rajah</HI> is now abroad, in his Expedition to the Coast of <HI>Choro∣mandel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A particu∣lar <HI>Rajah</HI>'s Revolt.</NOTE> where he expects Recruits of Men and Money; he has secur'd a strong Party upon the Coast of <HI>Mala∣bar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great length of a <HI>Rajah</HI>'s Arms.</NOTE> and it's believ'd will in a short time appear in the Field with very Potent Forces.

<P>The <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Army are pursuing their Conquests with all vigour towards Cape <HI>Comeron,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mo∣gul</HI>'s Am∣bition.</NOTE> the Southermost Pro∣montory of <HI>India,</HI> where are several Inferiour Princes not yet attempted up∣on, the Conquering of whom take up

<P>Besides the vast Army which is al∣ways Incamped, and ready for any Expedition and onset, the several <HI>Na∣bobs</HI> and Vice-Roys are obliged to keep continually in Pay considerable Forces, for maintaining their own Port, and the Peace of the Provinces where they preside. Soveraign Princes do not exceed some of these in point of State and Income. The <HI>Nabob</HI> or Gover∣nour of <HI>Bengal</HI> was reputed to have left behind him at his Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lacks, Courous, Padans, Nils, what they are.</NOTE> twenty Courous of Roupies: A Courou is an hundred thousand Lacks, a Lack is an hundred thousand Roupies, a Padan is an hundred thousand Courous, a Nil is an hundred thousand Padans; Lacks, Courous, Padans, and Nils, rise by a gradual advancement of an hundred thousand higher one than another.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> seldom leaves the Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s li∣ving in his Camp.</NOTE> but both he and his <HI>Haram</HI> keep their Tents Winter and Summer in the Field.

its Cities can afford them; and whatever the Kingdom yields, may be with as much ease purchased here, as in any publick Fair. So that there is always in the Camp a multitude of People brought thither, as large almost as the Army, who come thither, some out of Curiosity, others out of Friendship and Relation, but the most for Sale of their Goods, which the Soldiers take off, by whom they live, and from whom they have their Subsistence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Order in the Camp.</NOTE>Where-ever the <HI>Mogul</HI> removes his Camp, the Generals and Officers, as well as private Centinels, still pitch their Tents in the same Position and Place in respect to his, and one another, as they formerly were posted in; so that he who once knows where such a Captain had his standing, may readily be directed to it, though he has decamped from the place he left an Hundred Miles. For all are obliged to the same distance, and to the same Station and Quarter in relation to one another, and the Emperour's Tent, in whatever Ground they pitch their Tents.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="107"/>Before the <HI>Mogul</HI> begins to move his Camp, to set out upon a Progress,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Measuring the Way, a thing custo∣mary in the <HI>Indies.</HI></NOTE> or undertake any small Journey; and be∣fore any Omrah, or Person of Note sets forward to Travel, the way they must pass is measured out by Line, by a Ser∣vant appointed for that Trouble; and a just account both of the distance and number of Miles is brought to them, before the Journey is begun: And so exact are they in maintaining this piece of <HI>Indian</HI> State, of measuring the Road, that though they have travell'd that way often, and are sufficiently know∣ing in all its Paths, yet without this Ceremony they are loath to stir.</P>
<P>Besides the Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mogul's Elephants.</NOTE> and the several Nabobs and Governours of Provinces and Cities, of Towns and Castles, which drain his Treasure, and put him upon immense Expences, the <HI>Indian</HI> Emperour maintains daily at least Four or Five Hundred Elephants, with Ca∣mels, Mules, and other Beasts of Burthen; some for the War, and others for his Women and Attendants, his Carriage and Provisions in the Field. The prin∣cipal of all his stately Campaign Ele∣phants has a stated extraordinary Al∣lowance

<P>These mighty Animals are in high esteem in all the Oriental Kingdoms, especially at <HI>Siam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The White Elephant respected at <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> whose Soveraign is renown'd for his Respect to the White Elephant, upon the Perswasion he has of its being inspired with the Soul of some supreme Prince. And from the Bulk and Strength, the Sensibleness and Docility of that Creature, they infer commonly, that nothing less than the Soul of some Illustrious Prince, or migh∣ty Heroe, can animate it, and be re∣ceiv'd into a Body so stately and large. The <HI>Achen</HI> Elephants are most looked upon for their Teeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Achen</HI> Ivory best.</NOTE> because that Ivo∣ry they say, maintains its Whiteness, and turns not Yellow, as other does. They say that it's thirty Years before the Elephants come to their full growth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two ways of catching Elephants.</NOTE>The wild Elephants, which the <HI>Mo∣gul</HI> and other Princes keep tame, are taken different ways. Sometimes by digging Pits in the Ground, and co∣vering

them with false Earth, in the Paths frequented by the Elephants, which walking upon it deceives their Weight, and suddenly they drop down. But if the unweildy Animal chances to evade this Covert Contrivance, he grows very vigilant ever after, and wa∣rily with his Trunk examines all su∣spected Ground he is likely to tread up∣on. Sometimes they decoy the Male with a Female Elephant bred up for that purpose, which leads him into a narrow Passage, hedged in so strongly on both sides with Trunks of Trees, and many pieces of Timber, that he can neither turn about his monstrous Body to step backwards, nor remove with all his mighty Strength the Obstacles that inclose and barracade him, till he is chafed and spent, and thoroughly in∣tangled. After this he is taken and led home between two others that are tame, and his Wildness presently wears off, and in less than a Fortnight's time he quietly submits to Discipline, be∣thinks himself, and grows familiar. The Female Elephant receives the Male lying upon her Back,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way that the E∣lephants engender▪</NOTE> contrary to the Custom of other Animals; and the
<PB N="194" REF="109"/>
Male is said to carry his Testicles be∣tween his Ears. After they are taken they seldom Ingender, tho' sometimes they burn with a lustful Heat, which is not extinguished but by Fire brought near them, or the Blood of the Riders, if they chance at that time to be upon them.</P>

His eldest Son Sultan <HI>Mozum</HI> was to be left Inheritor of the Throne, to secure his peaceable Possession; yet would not this defend the Claims from the Royal Brothers, who are ready to dispute it with their Wit and Courage, with all the Force and Art of War.

Only for the Encourage∣ment of Trade in Cities and Maritime Towns, he dispenses with the Mer∣chants building their Houses, and the Propriety of them descending in their Families; very few are allowed Pater∣nal Inheritances; but even all this is the extraordinary Grace and Favour of the Prince, and revocable at his Plea∣sure.

<P>Since the Conquest of <HI>Viziapour,</HI> the Diamond Mines are claim'd and pos∣sess'd by the <HI>Indian</HI> Emperour, who for some time since thought fit to shut them up.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rate of digging for Dia∣monds.</NOTE> They formerly paid to the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> so much hourly for the liberty of digging, whether they were fortunate in finding any Diamond or no; a Pagod, which is a piece of Gold valued there at Nine Shillings, was the stated Price for an Hours time. We have an Account, that he reserv'd ano∣ther Diamond Ground in his Country for his own Use, which yielded him
<PB N="199" REF="111"/>
daily several Ounces, whenever he im∣ploy'd his Labourers to work, which were reckon'd to be near Six Thousand, whose very Wages consum'd a great part of the Gains.</P>
<P>Those that dig the Ground are nar∣rowly look'd to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Dia∣monds of such a size belong to the <HI>Mogul.</HI></NOTE> and examin'd at their Departure, that nothing be privately convey'd or stole away; and yet they sometimes escape all Discovery, by slipping a Stone into their Mouths, or thrusting it upwards in their lower Parts, or by bribing of the Overseers. By this means we sometimes meet with large Stones very valuable. Two I saw at <HI>Suratt,</HI> the smaller was a sort of Table-Diamond, rated at Twelve Thousand Pounds; the other was lar∣ger, and exceeded the Price of the o∣ther almost Eight Thousand Pounds. All Stones of such a Size are Royalties, and Sacred to the Crown; and who∣ever finds them, or wheresoever they are heard of, they are presently seized, and taken for the use of the <HI>Mogul.</HI> Therefore the Owner of these Noble Diamonds solemnly engaged our Secre∣sie, and bound us to Silence, before we were permitted a sight of them. The
<PB N="200" REF="112"/>
Stones of <HI>India</HI> are not so rich, or of equal Repute with those of the Island <HI>Borneo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Diamonds from <HI>Bor∣neo</HI> most fam'd.</NOTE> whose Sparkling and Bright∣ness gives a glorious and surpassing Splendour. The Diamonds are found rough, cover'd with a Coat or Shell, which is taken off, and then the Dia∣mond is polish'd, and cut in such Fi∣gures, as the natural Shape of the Stone, or the Design of the Lapidary inclines to.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way to know true Diamonds.</NOTE> The Art of discerning the excellence of Diamonds by the Eye, is very curious; because there is such an Affinity between the Brightness of Stones, that some eminent <HI>Indian</HI> Jew∣ellers have been impos'd upon by false ones brought from <HI>Europe;</HI> because they shot such Rays, and the Lustre with which they shin'd was so ex∣traordinary. But the Hammer and Scales discover'd that Fallacy, which the Eyes could not; they were softer than a genuine Diamond, and lighter than one of the same size: For no Stone comes near a Diamond in hardness; nor, of the same magnitude, in Weight. Diamonds take their Estimate from their Magnitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The valua∣ble Quali∣ties in Di∣amonds.</NOTE> Splendour, Figure, and Water; for some Persons value a
<PB N="201" REF="112"/>
Diamond of such a Water much more than of another; and some are pleas'd with such a sort of Cut, beyond any else. Thus a fair Rose-Diamond of Black Water and Diamond Cut was of general Esteem with some <HI>Europeans</HI> at <HI>Suratt,</HI> whilst a White Water gain'd a Repute with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and Table-Diamonds were with them of best E∣steem. The <HI>Moors</HI> exalt the Rate of such a Diamond, whose Surface is cut in very minute Figures, much less than what the <HI>Europeans</HI> affect, though in all things else the Diamond was equally good and valuable. For as the use of a Diamond, and all other Stones, is very inconsiderable, in respect of that high Value which the Fancy of Man and common Custom has put upon them; so are their Rates too very va∣riable and uncertain, as this Instance of a Rubie will make out. A Rubie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Excel∣lence of a Rubie a∣bove a Di∣amond.</NOTE> which in Perfection is a Stone superiour to a Diamond, made this gradual Ex∣altation of its Rates in <HI>India.</HI> It was sold at first at the rate of 400 Roupies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several prices paid for the same Ru∣bie.</NOTE> afterwards at 600, then at 800, then at 1200; from this it rose to 1600, thence to 2000, after this it mounted
<PB N="202" REF="113"/>
to 2400, then to 2800, from which it was sold for 3000, and lately for 3200. Thus the Fancy of the Purchaser ad∣vanc'd it at length Seven Hundred <HI>per Cent.</HI> beyond the Original Price it was first reckon'd at. There perfect Rubies are scarce attainable, those of a deep clear Colour are rarely seen, which put Men upon a hot Chace after them when they are heard of, and inhaunces their Va∣lue and Esteem.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mogul's Avarice.</NOTE>Notwithstanding all these Diamonds and immense Treasure, of which the <HI>Mogul</HI> is Absolute Master, yet is not his Mind satisfied, nor his Desires abated by his Accessions, they rather stretch and swell the more, and push him on to aspire to that real Character, which his Father assum'd, of being <HI>King of the World.</HI> So little has either Increase of Wealth, or Extent of Power, heal'd his restless Faculties, or compos'd the unruly Turbulence of his Spirit.

Air of Majesty and Grandeur, than that meaner Action which is recorded of him in <HI>India,</HI> of stripping the <HI>Faquires</HI> of their Wealth and Jewels.</P>
<P>It seems this Prince was minded to compass a little Treasure somewhere, and the only Method he pitch'd upon for it, was to make a Booty of the <HI>Fa∣quires.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aureng-zebe</HI>'s rob∣bing the <HI>Faquires.</HI></NOTE> These <HI>Faquires</HI> nearly resem∣ble the <HI>Romish</HI> Mendicants in some things, their Character I shall expati∣ate upon hereafter. The Emperour therefore causes Proclamation to be made through all the Provinces of his Kingdom, <HI>That all</HI> Faquires <HI>should make ready to repair to a splendid Entertainment, which he design'd to prepare for them.</HI> The News of this Royal Banquet was e∣steem'd so honourable an Instance of Condescention in the Emperour to these poor Men, that without any further Summons or Invitation they instantly prepar'd and flockt from all the re∣motest parts to come and receive it. When they were come, and had satis∣fied themselves with the sumptuous Feast, and overjoy'd at the Thoughts of being Guests to such a Noble Ban∣quet, to which they had been called by
<PB N="204" REF="114"/>
the Person of their Emperour, they now address themselves to him with grateful Acknowledgments for his Bounty in those Royal undeserv'd Fa∣vours, so far beyond what the Mean∣ness and Poverty of their Condition would suffer them so much as to think of. And withal wishing him, that Glory and Success might be the distin∣guishing Characters of his prosperous Reign for many Years, they humbly craved Liberty of departing to their proper Dwellings. To which the Em∣perour reply'd to this Effect, <HI>I would not have you think that I have yet forgot the Kindness I had for you and your Pro∣fession, in my former Years. 'Tis not the being seated upon the Throne of</HI> India, <HI>that can make me overlook the Consideration of your Poverty, or the Relation I had to you, e'er Fortune and your Good Wishes rais'd me to the Glory of my Ancestors, and the Soveraignty I now enjoy. And therefore as you have thought fit to taste of my Banquet, and express your selves pleas'd with the Entertainment; so I expect from you likewise the acceptance of some Raiments I have provided for your Ʋse, to prevent your Return in that ragged Dress; and that
<PB N="205" REF="114"/>
the World may see after your Departure hence, what Kindness I had for you, in conferring these more lasting Favours upon you.</HI> At this they unanimously voted for their old Cloaths, as more agreea∣ble to their Condition, and that he had sufficiently honour'd them by his splen∣did Repast. But the Servants, who stood by, immediately unstript the <HI>Fa∣quirs,</HI> and brought forth fresh Garments for their old, in which were found a∣bundance of Jewels, Gold, and Pre∣cious Stones, enough by far to overpay the Expence; as <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> by his former Acquaintance and ancient Inti∣macy with them could well discover. This Relation which I had from a Gen∣tleman at <HI>Suratt</HI> agrees very well with <HI>Auren-Zebe</HI>'s Policy; but methinks it suits not well with his Honesty and Greatness.</P>
<P>The Insolence of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inso∣lence of the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> in <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> as well as <HI>Rajahs,</HI> gives likewise some Di∣sturbance to this Prince, and has drawn down his Arms against their Forces, which has driven several of them from the adjacent Islands to repair for shelter to our Island of <HI>Bombay.</HI> The <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Army has made several Inroads into

But the Lady's Charms blinded his Reason, and biassed both his Justice and Civility, made him refuse to dis∣miss her, and treat the Messengers with such Violence, that the <HI>Mogul</HI> in Vindication of the <HI>Rajah,</HI> encourag'd his storming of the Town.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Rea∣sons of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Enmity to the <HI>Portu∣guese.</HI></NOTE>Other Reasons are used for the <HI>Mo∣gul</HI>'s present infesting the Country of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and for sending three several Parties of Men, pillaging, burn∣ing and destroying all before them.

<PB N="207" REF="115"/>
to the <HI>Mogul.</HI> Some ascribe the Hatred and Hostility of the <HI>Moors</HI> at this time to these two insufferable Acti∣ons of the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> Besides all this, the Religion of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> is very offensive to this Emperour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>3.</HI> Their Idolatry.</NOTE> who carries such an invincible Antipathy to Idola∣try, and all sort of Adoration of Ima∣ges, that he has now suppressed the greatest part of all the Pagodes of his Dominions, where his Pagan Subjects incens'd and invok'd the Idols. Nay, this is such an Abomination to the Ma∣hometan Belief, that the <HI>Moguls</HI> allow not the Representation of any Creature that has Life, even upon their Tea-Cups and China Ware, nor admit the Figure of any Animal upon their At∣lasses or other Silks. Therefore the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Religion being grosly tainted with this manner of False Worship, has render'd them very detestable to this sort of Men, as well as other things have made them odious to the <HI>Arabians</HI> at <HI>Muscat.</HI> They that were formerly the Glory and Terror of the Eastern Seas, who flowed with Wealth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The low condition of the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> in <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> and all the Riches of the <HI>Indian</HI> and the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph, are now as low and de∣clining,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mogul's Age.</NOTE>The <HI>Mogul</HI> is now past Eighty Years of Age, but yet administers the weigh∣ty Affairs of his vast Kingdom, and re∣tains a Vigour in his Discerning Fa∣culties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His care of what he eats.</NOTE> Whatever he eats is first ta∣sted by his Daughter, and passes un∣der the Chops or Seals of three or four principal <HI>Omrahs;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Drink.</NOTE> and his Drink is the Water of the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> which is reputed Sacred throughout all his Kingdom, and is said to sanctifie the Natives, whether they drink, or bath in it.

and a Quart of it is lighter by much than any other Water.

And all the Women of Fashion in <HI>India</HI> are close penn'd in by their jealous Husbands, who for∣bid them the very sight of all Stran∣gers. However the Watch is neither so careful, nor their Modesty so blame∣less, but that they sometimes will look abroad for Variety, as well as their ro∣ving Husbands do. A Passage of which I shall here insert.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A pleasant Story of an ingenious lewd Wo∣man.</NOTE> A Gentlewoman, viciously inclin'd, contrives one Day to get abroad, with a trusty Familiar of her Acquaintance, though totally a Stranger to her new Husband. She freely imparts her lewd Intentions, earnestly requests her Fidelity, and withal desires she would vouchsafe to take the Message upon her self, and walk into the Bazar, and there espy what comely Person she could meet with, proper, lovely, young, and handsom, and conduct him privately to such Apartments as she had provi∣ded.
<PB N="211" REF="117"/>
The Friend, thus instructed, goes abroad, views, and culls out from the rest in the Bazar the most amiable Per∣son she could meet with, and intreat∣ing him to step aside, discovers the In∣triegue, and then conducts him to the place appointed. The Gallant it seems was Husband to the Gentlewoman that expected him, who seeing him come near the Gate, was all in Confu∣sion, and quite confounded at the sight of his unfortunate Approach. But she found it was no time to dally, or de∣lay her Resolutions, and therefore in∣stantly summon'd all her Thoughts, and after a little Pause, threw her self directly upon the Cot or Bed that was by, and put the Covering over her Face. Her Husband, ignorant whom she was, and knowing for what Intent he was sent for, begins immediately to disturb her, and by and by endeavours to uncover her Face. At which she rose up in a seeming Rage, and told him, <HI>For shame, Sir, I have often heard of your Pranks and loose Intriegues abroad, but my Charity made me willing to unbelieve it, till this Minute has given me an invincible Argu∣ment, for assuring me of the Truth of what
<PB N="212" REF="118"/>
was spoken. I sent on purpose to find you out, and plac'd my self as a Stranger here to entertain you; and hither you came, I find, with dishonest Resolutions, and treach∣erous Designs to our Nuptial Bed. Can you pretend to so much Tenderness and Af∣fection for me, and yet listen to the least Temptation that courts or calls you from me? Was I ever unfaithful, or cool in my Affection, that might thereby drive you from my Embraces, to follow Strangers you never heard of?</HI> At this rate she turn'd the Argument upon himself, made him the only Person guilty of these wanton Amours, and with a gargled Mouth endeavour'd to wipe off all the Defilements of her Thoughts, and to render her Innocence as clear as her Excuse. She knew that a Conjugal Affection is very apt to grow jealous upon any apparent suspicion of mutual Fidelity, and that nothing sooner ex∣cites and ferments the Rage of a Man, than the apprehension of a Partner in his Bed. But yet this Jealousie is much extinct among the Inhabitants upon the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Women of∣fer'd to Strangers.</NOTE> where the Hus∣bands, even the prime Nobility, to compleat the Welcom of their Enter∣tainments,
<PB N="213" REF="118"/>
offer the Familiarity of their Wives; and esteem the rejecting this Civility as an Affront. Two <HI>English</HI> Merchants some time before I came to <HI>India,</HI> were invited abroad, and after Dinner were tempted with this kind of Treat; but the Piety of one of them kept him from it, whilst the immodest Frolicks of the other intic'd him on to the use of an unlawful Pleasure. And many of their Women by their usual Custom in these cases, quite contrary to that of other Nations, have gain'd the Name of <HI>Malabar Quills.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lati∣tude of <HI>Su∣ratt.</HI></NOTE>THE City of <HI>Suratt</HI> lies in 21 De∣grees, and some odd Minutes of North Latitude. 'Tis by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> call'd <HI>Muziris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Situa∣tion.</NOTE> and is situated upon a River Ten or Twelve Miles distant from the Sea. The Name of the River is <HI>Tap∣py,</HI> or <HI>Tindy,</HI> which rises from the Mountain of <HI>Decan,</HI> and from thence falls down through <HI>Brampore,</HI> and by <HI>Meanders</HI> from <HI>Suratt</HI> glides down gent∣ly into the Ocean. The Circumfe∣rence
<PB N="215" REF="119"/>
of it, with the Suburbs, is be∣tween two and three <HI>English</HI> Miles, tending somewhat in its Position to the Form of a Semicircle or Half Moon, because of the winding of the River, to which half of it adjoyns. It is for∣tified with a Wall, which is flankt at certain Distances with Towers and Battlements, occasion'd by the frequent Incursions of the Enemies; but its greatest Strength is in the Castle, which commands not only the Ships and Boats in the River, but likewise guards the City by Land.</P>
<P>The Castle is built towards the South West part of the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle.</NOTE> having a River to defend it on one side, and a Ditch on the other. It is built square, and fortified at each Corner with a large Tower, containing various Lodg∣ings, and furnish'd with all Conveni∣ences fit for accommodating the Go∣vernour, and has several Canons moun∣ted upon the Walls.</P>
<P>The Entrance into the City is by six or seven Gates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gates of the City.</NOTE> where are Centinels fixt continually, requiring an Account, upon the least Suspicion, of all that en∣ter in, or pass out of the City.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="120"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Build∣ings.</NOTE>The Houses are many of them fair and stately, tho' unproportionable to the Wealth of the Inhabitants, who are always concern'd to conceal their Riches, and therefore never exceed in any Luxurious Furniture, lest it should prove too powerful a Temptation to the Avarice of the <HI>Mogul.</HI> They are flat roof'd, or rather made a little shelving, after the manner of the Build∣ings in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> cover'd with Tiles, and the Walls are made of Brick or Stone. The Windows are without Glass, and kept open for the Convenience of the fresh Air; and the Floors both of the lower and upper Stories are all Terrass'd to make them cool. But the poorer sort, and such as inhabit the Skirts of the City, live much meaner, in Houses, whose Walls are only Bambous at a Foot distance, with Reeds wove through them; and their Covering is only Cajan, or Palm-leaves of Trees, which gives them the common Name of Cajan-Houses.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Streets</NOTE>The Streets are some too nar∣row, but in many places of a conve∣nient breadth; and in an Evening, e∣specially near the Bazar, or Market-place,

For here they stand with their Silks and Stuffs in their Hands, or upon their Heads, to invite such as pass by to come and buy them.</P>
<P>In the midst of the City is a spacious vacant place, called <HI>Castle-Green,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Castle-Green.</NOTE> be∣cause of its nearness to the Castle, on which are laid all sorts of Goods in the open Air, both Day and Night, ex∣cepting the <HI>Mussoun</HI> time.

And the River is very commodious for the Importa∣tion of Foreign Goods, which are brought up to the City in Hoys and Yachts, and Country Boats, with great Convenience and Expedition.

<P>I shall distinguish the Natives here into three sorts.

Very few of the Gentiles being called to any considerable Trust, or incou∣rag'd

any more, than just to follow their several Manual Occupations, or Merchandize. For Religion, which puts a Biass upon the Mind, Intitles them to the Court Favours, when it carries a conformity to that of their Prince. Therefore the Gentiles are little esteem'd of by the <HI>Mogul,</HI> and contemned by the Moors, and often treated with Inhumanity and neglect, because of their adhesion to the Prin∣ciples of a Religion, which is differenr from that of the State. And yet their peaceable submissive Deportment wins mightily upon the <HI>Moors,</HI> and takes off much of that scornful Antipathy which they harbour against them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Moors</HI> forbid to taste Wine, but allow'd Concubines.</NOTE>As the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Principles indulge an extraordinary Liberty for Women, so are they nice in the innocent allow∣ance of Wine, and strictly prohibit the tasting of strong Liquor.

Cloves and Amber-Grese, Cinnamon and other fragrant Oriental Spices, do often help to compound their Dishes of Palau, and other Meats that are in use among them, in the Families of Men of Fortune and Estates. Some of whom, notwithstanding their Pro∣phet, thro' whose Prohibition they are restrain'd from Wine, will yet privately be as Licentious therein, as other Persons who are allow'd to drink it with moderation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dutra intoxicate∣ing Herb.</NOTE> And many of them take the liberty of mixing Dutra and Water together to drink, without a∣ny privacy or fear, which will intoxi∣cate almost to Madness, when they are in the humour of gulping it freely; and this sometimes puts them beyond their Native tender Deportment, and forces them upon suddain Bold Attempts.

this Herb Dutra, that whatever Hu∣mour prevails in any person at the time of his drinking it to Excess, that Tem∣per continues with him in the high∣est pitch, 'till the inebriating quality abates.

The Agent expressed his humble
<PB N="241" REF="132"/>
Sense of the Honour they had vouch∣saf'd him, and his satisfaction at the freedom they had taken; and withal assur'd them, that such an Evening the Kids should be provided for their com∣ing. He instantly sent abroad his Ser∣vant, for procuring him two of the fattest Pigs that could be met with, and order'd them to be roasted against the time appointed; and pulling off their Skin, and cutting off their Heads and Feet, had them brought before the invited Guests. They rejoyc'd at the sight of them, and when they had tast∣ed, applauded the delicacy of the Meat, eat it with abundance of delight, and boasted that they had never seen any such plump Kids, whose relish out-did any thing they had ever tasted; and heartily wisht for the opportunity of such another Repast, and the liberty of Banqueting frequently upon such Dainties. They admir'd the Christians Indulgence in such noble Liquor, and such exquisite Fare, and believ'd that the unconfin'd Luxury in Eating was equal to the pleasure of their desirable variety of Women; and that the Car∣nal Excesses approv'd by <HI>Mahomet</HI> do

not outvie the unconstrain'd Liberty which the Christians take in sumptu∣ous Repasts, and such kind of Luxu∣rious Sensuality.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> are only bound to ab∣stain from Unclean Beasts, and load their Tables with Fish and Fowl, and other Fare.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fast Ramezan.</NOTE>The <HI>Moors</HI> with a very rigid and avowed Abstinence, observe every Year one Month, a Fast, which they term the <HI>Ramezan;</HI> during which time they are so severely abstemious, that they stretch not their Hands to either Bread or Wa∣ter, 'till the Sun be set, and the Stars appear; no, not the Youths of 12 or 13 Years of Age. Which makes the Penance so much the more rigorous and troublesome, in that a draught of Wa∣ter in those warm parching Climates is so very necessary, and so refreshing to such as are ready to faint with Thirst. This Fast is not kept always at the
<PB N="243" REF="133"/>
same Season of the Year, but begins its date Annually more early by Eleven Days. When I was at <HI>Suratt,</HI> this mortifying Custom was about the Month of <HI>September,</HI> at which time the <HI>Moors</HI> would begin to refresh them∣selves about the close of the Evening, and Eat then freely; and by an Early Collation in the Morning, before the dawning of the Light, prepare them∣selves for the drought and heat of the following Day. The Almighty, they told us, requir'd from <HI>Mahomet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A story con∣cerning <HI>Ma∣homet.</HI></NOTE> that his followers should be oblig'd to this Austerity, the whole Circuit of the Year; but that the Holy Prophet, in compassion to the Faithful, obtain'd from God the confinement of it only to a Month, which would therefore highly aggravate their Crime, if they neglect∣ed the Dedication of so small a Portion of the Year to this Religious Abstinence, tho' the observance of it had been in∣joyn'd after a more rigorous manner than it is. And to add to the Sanctity of this Celebrated and solemn Fast, their <HI>Mullahs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mul∣lahs</HI> Devo∣tions.</NOTE> acted with a sacred Zeal, and lively concern for the Souls of the People, will at this time spend whole

Nights in the <HI>Musseets,</HI> in chanting a∣loud alternately their Divine Hymns, 'till the approach of day breaks up their Devotions: And so they com∣pleat their Fast, according to the strict∣est Rules of the most rigid <HI>Asceticks,</HI> by mixing Prayers and Watchings with their Abstinence; in which, as well as in their Publick Prayers and Religious Worship, they tie themselves up to a very nice and devout strictness, and be∣have themselves with all those decencies of Respect, with that astonishing Re∣verence in the <HI>Musseets,</HI> as not to defile them with either their Eyes or Lips; not daring so much as to turn their Heads to gaze about, or utter the least word to one another. Which profound Respect casts an obloquy and deserv'd Reproach upon some Professors of a much purer Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their de∣cent Religi∣ous Beha∣viour.</NOTE> and more Holy Faith, whose careless Deportment and familiar Address discountenance all the Religious decorum of Prayers, and might tempt those Heathens to con∣clude, that our Devotions were rather some light Diversion, than the effects of serious and sacred Thoughts.</P>

Ballisters of four or five Inches thickness support it; the sides of it are curiously wrought, and richly plated with Gold or Silver; the Covering is made of fine Silk; the Cushions within are generally of rich Zarbaft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zarbaft is a kind of Silver or Gold Bro∣kade.</NOTE> with the choicest Carpets spread under them.

One of the principal Persons about <HI>Su∣ratt,</HI>
<PB N="258" REF="141"/>
was thus surpriz'd and insnar'd while I was there, and lost both him∣self, his Fortune, and his Friends, in their eager Admiration. For they are Educated in the Improvement of all that is gay and entertaining, they set themselves off with such advantage, by a Rhetorical Look and taking Air, wherein they shew an unparallell'd Master-piece of Art, that a grave <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI> will scarce adventure himself in the sight of their insinuating Tempta∣tions, and charming deportment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Shows.</NOTE>Among the Men, whose Imployment it is to divert Spectators with amazing Shows and Sights, some, they say, will take in their Hands a Clew of Thread, and throw it upwards in the Air till it all unravels, and then climbing up themselves by this tender Thread to the top of it, presently fall down piece-meal upon the Ground▪ and when all is dropt, unite again the parted Mem∣bers. Others are said to raise a Man∣go-Tree, with ripe Fruit upon its Branches, in the space of one or two Hours. To confirm which Relation, it was affirmed confidently to me, that a Gentleman who had pluckt one of
<PB N="259" REF="141"/>
these Mangoes, fell sick upon it, and was never well as long as he kept it, 'till he consulted a <HI>Bramin</HI> for his Health, who prescrib'd his only Remedy would be the restoring of the <HI>Mango,</HI> by which he was restor'd to his Health again.</P>
<P>Dancing Snakes kept tame in Bask∣ets are every where common▪<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dancing Snakes.</NOTE> their Keepers use them as familiarly as we do Puppies, take them in their Hands, and sometimes force them to bite their Flesh without any consequent harm. He that carries them about, plays up∣on a Pipe when he exposes them, at the noise of which the Snake will hiss, spread his Head and throw it about.</P>
<P>We had brought into our Factory once a tame Snake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A large Fowl swal∣lowed by a Snake.</NOTE> of that bigness and length, that one of the Fowls of the largest size was swallowed whole by it, with all the Feathers on, in my sight, it first began with the Head of the Fowl, and then twisting its Body about the Body of the Fowl, squeezed it close, to facilitate the Passage. The Fowl Screeched once at the first seizing, and afterwards lay dead: The Snake strug∣led sometime with the Bulky part of the Body before it could get it down;
<PB N="260" REF="142"/>
but as soon as it was once swallow'd, it found a speedy passage to the middle of the Snake, which lay there stretcht and swell'd, 'till the natural Heat, in less than 24 Hours, had digested both the Bones and Feathers. This was an extraordinary Morsel, and far surpas∣sing that ordinary Food upon which the Snakes do commonly feed. But there is much more danger than diver∣sion from these Serpents in <HI>India,</HI> where they are so numerous, that the unwary Traveller is often expos'd to the fatal effects of their sudden Venom. For a Peon of mine, named <HI>Gemal,</HI> walk∣ing abroad in the Grass after the Rains, was unfortunately bit on a sudden by one of them. The latent Snake twisted unawares about his Leg, and in a short time brought him to the Ground, by causing in him an imme∣diate deliquium of Spirit, almost even to Expiration. The Servants who were standing by, amaz'd at the acci∣dent, called immediately upon an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Merchant, who hasten'd towards him with a special Medicine for his Re∣covery. The thing which he carried about him, and which instantly apply∣ed,
<PB N="261" REF="142"/>
is a Specifick against the Poison of Snakes, cured him, and therefore ob∣tains the Name of Snake-stone.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Snake Stone.</NOTE> It is a small artificial Stone, almost flat, only with a little protuberance in the middle, and of a gray Colour. The Composition of it is Ashes of burnt Roots, mixt with a kind of Earth, which is found at <HI>Diu,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> and those are burnt to∣gether again, out of which Paste the Stones are formed. They are not all alike Colour'd, but those that have re∣ceiv'd more of the Fire, are thereby inclin'd to a lighter Gray, the others are a little more dark.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Virtues.</NOTE> This Stone Cures by the application of it to the part invenom'd, to which it immedi∣ately sticks fast, and by its powerful Attraction sucks back the infus'd Ve∣nom, 'till its Pores are full. Then like a glutted Horse-Leach it falls off, and disgorges the replenisht Pores in Milk (the properest liquor for this purpose) which by discolouring, it renders livid. Upon this it recovers new strength, and its Alexipharmick quality again, and is speedily prepar'd for a fresh Draught of Poison, if any remains in
<PB N="262" REF="143"/>
the affected part, 'till it quite extracts whatever the venomous Serpent had immited; which makes those Counter-poisons in great esteem against all ex∣ternal Attacks upon the Body; as the Cordial Antidotes are most valuable for expelling or subduing any Poyson in∣wardly receiv'd. The double Excel∣lence of this Stone recommends its worth very highly, in that a little of it scraped off, and mixt with Wine, or some other proper vehicle, and inwardly ta∣ken, is reputed one of the most pow∣erful Medicines against any Malignant Fevers or Infectious Diseases, that is known; and much excess the deserv∣edly fam'd <HI>Gasper Antoni,</HI> or Goa Stone. The trial of these Stones is made by fixing them to the Roof of the Mouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to try the Snake Stone.</NOTE> to which if they stick fast, 'tis a sign they are genuine, if they easily fall off, fictitious. Another method for know∣ing the true Stones from the Counter∣feit, is to immerse them in a Glass of Water, where, after a while, if some light Ebullitions rise from them, and ascend through the Body of the Water, this likewise is an approv'd Sign that the Stone is not spurious. The <HI>Eu∣ropeans,</HI>
<PB N="263" REF="143"/>
for the Security of themselves against the Danger of these Serpents, which are every where so common in <HI>India,</HI> carry always about them one of these Stones inclosed in a Heart of Gold, fixt to a Golden Chain, which hangs about their Necks.</P>
<P>A burning Coal is boasted to be able to effect the same Cure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Virtue of a burn∣ing Coal.</NOTE> as the Snake-Stone does; and to heal the Venom of Serpents, or stinging of Scorpions, by gradually drawing out all the Poyson, when it is applied very near the Wound; which is not easily vext or incommoded by the Fire, by reason that the acuteness of the Venom a∣bates the sensibleness of the Heat of the Fire, and keeps it off.</P>
<P>As the Kingdom of <HI>Indostan</HI> is very much annoy'd by the multitude of these venomous Creatures, which lurk in all Coverts and secret places, so is it stockt with Medicines extraordinary a∣gainst their Harm. The wise Designa∣tion of Heaven providing all things for the Convenience, as well as Necessity, both of Nations and particular Crea∣tures, by suiting Remedies peculiar to each ones Exigence, and appropriating
<PB N="264" REF="144"/>
agreeable Circumstances to the parti∣cular Natures of all. Therefore as inward Poysons prevail in these parts, as well as outward; so do Medicines likewise, which are available for abating and expelling both of them. For be∣sides several Poysonous Herbs which grow in <HI>India,</HI> the old Natives of <HI>Ben∣gal</HI> affirm, that if Sugar be kept for Thirty Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sugar long kept is poy∣sonous.</NOTE> it is as dangerous, as quick, and effectual Poyson as any. One of the Antidotes, above all the rest, is the celebrated <HI>Maldive</HI> Coco-nut,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mal∣dive</HI> Coco-Nut.</NOTE> of which this Encomium is given by <HI>Piso,</HI> in his <HI>Mantissa Aromatica,</HI> at the latter end of <HI>Bontius, Vera cum Gloria praedi∣care non dubito, Antistitem Alexipharma∣corum Coccum nostrum esse, experimentis indubitatis non fallacem.</HI> That is, He can truly boast by many infallible Ex∣periments, that there is no Alexiphar∣mick goes beyond the <HI>Maldive</HI> Coco-nut.

It cures the Bloody Flux, the Pestilence, and Malignant Fevers, Poysons, Falling Sickness, Pal∣sey, Convulsions, and frightful Tre∣mors of the Spirits: So great are its Virtues, that the use of it, as he else∣where tells us, is consecrated by a cer∣tain Priviledge of Nature to the sup∣port of Life, <HI>p.</HI> 207. Which made <HI>Ru∣dolphus,</HI> a certain <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour, un∣derstanding its Excellence, purchase it at the price of Four Thousand Florens.</P>
<P>The Name of this Nut with the <HI>Maldives</HI> is <HI>Tavarcare;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This Nut found in several parts of <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> and tho' it has appropriated the Name of <HI>Maldive,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et is it found in other parts of <HI>India</HI> besides, though probably the first, or most of them, are met with there. It is conjectured to be the same with the Land Coco-Nut, and that when the Ocean invading the Main Land of <HI>Asia</HI> made a Breach of the <HI>Maldives</HI> from it, these Nuts were cover'd under the Wa∣ter, which now and then are taken up in it floating, or washt upon the Shore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> are very fond of it, and strongly maintain its Medicinal Vir∣tues against Poyson; in Confirmation whereof, an old <HI>English</HI> Master of a
<PB N="266" REF="145"/>
Grab,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Cure per∣form'd by the <HI>Mal∣dive</HI> Coco-Nut.</NOTE> or small Vessel, <HI>George Toach,</HI> has frequently repeated this Story to me, <Q>That in his Voyage to <HI>Patta,</HI> which lies near the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> in the time of the Sale of his Cargo there, the King's Son of the Place was poysoned to that de∣gree, that his Skin was bloated and swollen upon him like a Bladder: He presently betakes himself for a Reme∣dy to the <HI>Maldive</HI> Coco-nut, several or which are found there. This he rubbed upon a hollow Stone, contain∣ing five or six spoonfuls of Water, till the Water was well tinctur'd by it▪ and in the same manner rubb'd a piece of a Rhinoceros Horn, and then drank the Water off. And re∣peating this Medicine for three or four Days, the Humours sensibly as∣swaged, and in that time were all drawn off by so powerful a Purgation, that though it had rack'd and exa∣min'd every part of his Body, yet he recover'd in that short space of time; the Swelling abated, and his Skin fell, and hung loose about him like a Gar∣ment.</Q>
I brought one of these Coco-nuts with me from <HI>Suratt,</HI> which was graciously accepted of by the late
<PB N="267" REF="145"/>
Queen, of Glorious and Immortal Me∣mory.</P>
<P>They ascribe very much likewise to the Rhinoceros Horn in <HI>India,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Virtue of the Rhi∣noceros Horn.</NOTE> as it is an Antidote against all poysonous Draughts, and hugely extol in it that Medicinal Excellence and singular Quality. The Character of this Horn prevail'd so far with a former Presi∣dent of ours at <HI>Suratt,</HI> that he ex∣chang'd for a Cup made of this Horn a large capacious Silver Bowl of the same bigness.</P>
<P>The Heat of the Country about <HI>Su∣ratt,</HI> will scarce permit that eager Pro∣secution of Sports or Recreations, which a cooler Climate does encourage; but a Game at Chess in their Houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> play at Chess.</NOTE> or in the Shades of the Streets, will in∣vite them to spend some Hours at it: I did not hear of their Expenses other∣wise, I mean of their Goods or Mo∣ney. For they seldom are heated into Passion, or ruinous Adventures, by the Polemick Traverses of that intricate puzling Game. Their Frolicks reach not to that pitch of Folly, as to ex∣change their Pastimes into Punish∣ments, or to make them hazard the
<PB N="268" REF="146"/>
loss of their comfortable Subsistence for ever, for diverting themselves for some Hours or Minutes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gaming for Money capital at <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> And to me it seems more rational, the Penalty of the <HI>Japanners</HI> upon Gaming, who have de∣creed it a Capital Crime to play for Money; than the Liberty taken by the <HI>Siamese,</HI> in playing away not only their Estates, but Families, and some∣times themselves too.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting of wild Beasts</NOTE>The variety of Wild Beasts afford the stouter <HI>Indians</HI> abundance of other Game, and divert them with more manly Pastimes.

<PB N="269" REF="146"/>

Till one, a little wiser and more cool than the other two, intreated their respite, and bespoke their Audience, and told them the case might be easily remit∣ted to the <HI>English</HI> President, who was able to give a just determination in it.

<P>And because the <HI>Moors</HI> have invent∣ed peculiar Arts and methods in their Recreations, from what obtain a∣mong us; I shall instance in some of their diversions, which will not be un∣grateful to the Reader, especially if he be a Man of Sports.</P>
<P>In hunting their Antilopes and Deer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hunt∣ing of Deer with Leo∣pards.</NOTE> as they are destitute of Dogs, so they endeavour to supply their want by tame Leopards, train'd and brought up for that purpose, which warily leap upon they Prey, and having once caught it, hold it fast.</P>
<P>In <HI>Persia,</HI> in the room of Dogs and Leopards, they bring up Faulcons to hunt their Antilopes and Bucks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deer Hun∣ted by Hawks.</NOTE> which are brought to <HI>India</HI> from thence, and
<PB N="272" REF="148"/>
are train'd to it after this manner. Whenever the Hawk they breed up to it is hungry, they fix its meat upon the Nose of a Counterfeit Antilope, and from thence only feed it, without allowing it any Meat but what it Eats there. After this they carry one or two of these Falcons into the Fields, and flying one of them at an Antilope, it fastens just upon his Nose, which so blinds and stops the Antilope, by the force and fluttering of its Wings, that he can neither well espy his way, nor find his Feet as nimbly as he would; and this gives a very easie admittance to the Men or Dogs to come in and catch him. If this Hawk is beaten off, which is sometimes done with much a∣do, another aloft stoops and lights up∣on the same place, and strikes him backwards with his Talons, 'till at length he is made a Prey: For one of the Hawks always mounts as the o∣ther stoops.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another way of Hunting the Game.</NOTE>Sometimes a great company of Men range the Fields, and walk together into the Inclosures, to look after their Game; when once they have espy'd the place where they fancy the Game lies, they
<PB N="273" REF="148"/>
inclose the Ground, and stand in a Ring, with Clubs or Weapons in their Hands, whilst they employ others to beat up the Ground, and raise it for them.</P>
<P>Nor are they destitute of ingenious Inventions, when they recreate them∣selves with Fowling, any less than they are in their Hunting Sports. For in the room of our stalking Horses, they make use of stalking Oxen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stalking Oxen.</NOTE> which are manag'd and bred up to the purpose, even to admiration. I have seen a <HI>Moor Indian</HI> shoot at once five or six Ducks under one of their Bellies, with∣out the least starting, or surprisal to the Ox; and the quiet temper of this la∣borious Animal renders it, I believe, as easily brought up to it, and as pro∣per for this Game as any Horse. Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> maintain themselves very well by this Art.</P>
<P>But they use another ingenious me∣thod for catching Wild Fowl, which is very pretty. The Fowler when he is in quest of his Game, espying at length his sport at a distance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ingeni∣ous way to catch Wild-Fowl.</NOTE> prepares a Man to go before him toward the place where he sees his Game, and car∣ry in his Hand the boughs of Trees, so
<PB N="274" REF="149"/>
artificially wrought and joyn'd toge∣ther, that they perfectly resemble a small Bush or Hedge, which is a shel∣ter both to the Fowler and him that carries it. By this contrivance, the Fowler passes altogether undiscover'd towards his sport, and gains the con∣venience not only of shooting at what distance he pleases, but sometimes ap∣proaches his Game so near, that he takes it almost in his Hand. If the Wild Fowl be at a distance upon the Water, he then contrives another method for coming near them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another in∣genious con∣trivance to catch Wild-Fowl.</NOTE> and surprizing them with his Hands. He takes a Pitcher or Earthen Jarr, so large that he fits it to his Head, which he covers all over, and decks it with the Feathers of what Water-Fowl he thinks convenient; and making holes in it for him to breath and look thro', he then fastens it upon his Head, and being expert in swimming, ventures into the Pond where he sees the Fowl, and moves towards them, without any thing visible but the Pitch∣er above the Water; when he comes near them where they swim about, he catches them one by one by their Legs, and silently pulls them under Water, and
<PB N="275" REF="149"/>
there fastens them to his Girdle. They all this while fancy the moving Fea∣ther'd Jarr a living Fowl, and those that were pluckt under the Water to have been Diving, 'till sometimes the Fowler catches the whole Flock.</P>
<P>Next to the <HI>Moors</HI> the <HI>Bannians</HI> are the most noted Inhabitants at <HI>Suratt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Banni∣ans.</HI></NOTE> who are Merchants all by Profession, and very numerous in all parts of <HI>India.</HI> They are most innocent and obsequious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tem∣per and ob∣sequious de∣portment.</NOTE> humble and patient to a Miracle; some∣times they are heated into harsh Ex∣pressions to one another, which is sel∣dom; and this Tongue-Tempest is term'd there a <HI>Bannian</HI> Fight, for it never rises to Blows or Blood-shed. The very killing of a Fly with them, is at Crime almost inexpiable. They cannot so much as endure hot Words, as they call them, from the <HI>Europeans;</HI> but if they see them exasperated, and in a Rage, retreat for a day or two, 'till they give them time to cool; and when they find the Passion asswag'd, form their Addresses in the most affable manner, and obliging Respect.</P>
<P>The Orientals are generally much more tender and insinuating in their Language,
<PB N="276" REF="150"/>
and more prompt &amp; easie in their Deport∣ment, than those that are bred in the Tempestuous Regions, and Northerly Air of <HI>Europe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tem∣pers of Men alter by the Climate they live in.</NOTE> which has a certain In∣fluence upon their Spirits, to render them boisterous and irregular, in re∣spect of that submissive temper and af∣fable Carriage of the Eastern Nations. He that has convers'd for any time a∣mong these, can hardly bear the rough∣ness, or be brought to digest the rude∣ness of the others. For the sudden Changes, and uncertainty of the Weather in all Seasons of the Year, affect both the Heads and Hearts of such as are Conversant in these uneven Climates; it makes them suddenly heated into Passions, and as hardly brought to an warmth of Affection; it makes them both unlike other Na∣tions, and inconsistent with themselves, by raising unequal Humours, and un∣constancy in the Passions, unfixt De∣sires, and uncertain Ends. And were the <HI>Bannians</HI> to be transported hither, who hold a Transmigration, they would be apt immediately upon their Arrival to conclude, that many of the Men had really invaded the Natures of
<PB N="277" REF="150"/>
some of the most savage Brutes, were animated with no other Souls than those of Tygers and Bears; and that the <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Opinion of the <HI>Lou∣garoos,</HI> or Men turn'd into Wolves, was as true and authentick a Notion, as any that prevail'd among them.</P>
<P>But that Opinion of the <HI>Bannians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reasons of the soft Temper of the <HI>Banni∣ans.</HI></NOTE> which possesseth them with an Horror of Blood, does quite discourage them from all Hostile Attacks and thoughts of War; and their Despotick Govern∣ment breaks their Spirits, and the fee∣ble phlegmatick Aliments, with the consumptive Heat of the Sun, all con∣tribute to weaken and effeminate their Constitutions, to the producing a tra∣ctable Disposition, and smooth regular Deportment.</P>
<P>They are mainly addicted to prose∣cute their Temporal Interest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Much giv∣en to Rich∣es.</NOTE> and the amassing of Treasure; and therefore will fly at the securing of a Pice, tho' they can command whole Lacks of Roupies. I know those among them computed to be worth an Hundred Thousand Pounds, whose Service the Prospect of Sixpence Advantage will command to traverse the whole City of
<PB N="278" REF="151"/>
<HI>Suratt.</HI> For they are always upon the Thoughts of increasing their Wealth, and plodding for Gain, which they lay hold on upon the least occasion, tho' by never so minute and inconsiderable Advantages. By which Diligence they generally secure a comfortable Subsi∣stence; and some of them amass a pro∣digious Treasure.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bannians</HI> are by much the most numerous, and by far the wealthiest of all the Pagans of <HI>India,</HI> whose Di∣stinction in Religion argues a difference of their various Vocations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Each Trade of a diffe∣rent Opini∣on in Reli∣gion.</NOTE> and each single Trade is diversified by some par∣ticular Opinions; the Goldsmith, and Scrivan, the Joyner, Barber, and Merchant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as they have different Employments, so are they of divers Sentiments, and distinguish'd in the Ceremonies of their Worship; and mix no more in their Sacred Sentiments of Religion, than in their Civil Arts. Therefore all their Arts are Heredita∣ry, and their Employments confin'd to their own Families. The Son is en∣gag'd in the Father's Trade, and to maintain the Profession of it in his Po∣sterity, it is transmitted always to the

<P>The <HI>Bannians</HI> are not restrain'd from the liberal Draughts of Tea and Cof∣fee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tea and Coffee drunk by them.</NOTE> to revive their wasted Spirits, a∣ny part of the Day; but in those they may Revel uncensur'd, as long as they please; and have there more inviting Temptations to drink them plentifully, than with us. For the Coffee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Art in making Coffee.</NOTE> when it it truly boiled and prepared, carries a kind of yellow Oil upon the head of it, by which it acquires a soft, pleasant Relish, and requires so much Art in bringing it to this Perfection, that it ingages some who affect this sort of Li∣quor in the expence of a skilful Peon, on purpose to look after it in the Pre∣paration.

<P>Tea likewise is a common Drink with all the Inhabitants of <HI>India,</HI> as well <HI>Europeans</HI> as Natives; and by the <HI>Dutcb</HI> is used as such a standing Enter∣tainment, that the Tea-pot's seldom off the Fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tea health∣ful in <HI>In∣dia.</HI></NOTE> or unimploy'd. This hot Liquor it may be suppos'd might not seem so proper and agreeable to so hot an Air, and yet we find is very con∣venient for our Health, and agree∣able to the Habits of our Bodies. And even all the Arak Punch which is dunk there, is seldom toucht, 'till by a heated Iron, or Wedge of Gold, it is made luke warm. This both supplies the Vapours which are continually ex∣hal'd from the Body, and helps the prevention of Fevers by keeping the Pores open.</P>
<P>Tea, with some hot Spice intermixt and boiled in the Water, has the Re∣pute of prevailing against the Head∣ach, Gravel, and Griping in the Guts, and 'tis generally drunk in <HI>India,</HI> either with Sugar-Candy, or, by the more curious, with small Conserv'd Lemons. And a Dram of double distill'd Arak, is prescrib'd likewise as an Excellent

Remedy against tht Gripes, and such inward Twistings of the Bowels. The frequent use of this Innocent Tea, and the perpetual perspiration caus'd by the Heat, which is augmented by this Li∣quor, are the reason why the Gout and Stone, Agues, Rheumatisms and Ca∣tarhs are rarely heard of in these parts. The Heat indeed abates the vigour of our Spirits, and thereby induces a lan∣guid Faintness, which is the general, but withal a very tolerable Infirmity, in respect of those acute Distempers. The <HI>Chinese,</HI> among whom the Tea grows, take abundance of this Drink before their Meals, and are generally very plump and in very good likeing.</P>
<P>Our <HI>English</HI> President enquir'd much for the Flower of Tea, among those who had been Conversant in <HI>China,</HI> but could never obtain a sight of any; and it seems very doubtful whether that Shrub bears any Flowers at all up∣on it.

Present for the chief Ministers, and it was very rarely to be found, however he brought with him a Taste of it for our President, among several other kinds, wherein he gave him a Morning En∣tertainment. And a Learned Physici∣an, who for some Years had lived in <HI>China,</HI> spoke nothing of this Flower of Tea, only gave this Account of three other sorts that grew there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three sorts of Tea.</NOTE> and were most frequently drunk among them, <HI>viz.</HI> Bing, Singlo, and Bohe. Bohe is a small Leaf and very young, and by its moisture, upon the score of its un∣der-growth, requires more than an or∣dinary frixure, which makes it acquire that blackness visible in it, and which discolours the Water to a kind of Red∣ness The second is Singlo, which is a larger Leaf, because more grown. The third, which is Bing, is the largest of all; and is in <HI>China</HI> of a proportionable larger rate than the other two. Singlo obtains most among the <HI>Europeans;</HI> but Bohe among the <HI>Chinese</HI> has so much the esteem and precedence above the other two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bohe the best Tea.</NOTE> that in their Sickness they totally forbid them, but in their most dangerous Distempers instantly make

use of this; and Experience convinces them of the Choice and Utility of that Leaf in their Extremities.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Tea grows.</NOTE> They all proceed, he told me, from a Shrub a∣bout the height of our Goosberry or Curran Bushes. The Leaf is first green,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way it is pre∣par'd.</NOTE> but is made crisp and dry by frying twice, or oftner, in a Pan; and as of∣ten as it is taken off the Fire it is roll'd with the Hand upon a Table, till it curls.

He found it growing in the Latitude of 51, as well as in a warmer Air; which gives a probable Conje∣cture for its thriving in our Kingdom; for <HI>London</HI> lies near the same Parallel.</P>
<P>As Musk and Amber grease are said to damage Pearl, so is Tea prejudic'd by the approach of unsavory Smells, and particularly of <HI>Assa Foetida,</HI> and is so delicate and tender, that it is injur'd by the very Breath of only the common am∣bient Air.

For there is not one of these Customs which are fasten'd upon them by the Rules of their Re∣ligion, but what comport very well, and highly contibute to the Health and Pleasure of their Lives. And for this end they are much addicted to sweet Smells and fragrant Exhalations, and generally each Night procure a Necklace of Jessemy Flowers to sleep with, for at that time they more sen∣sibly emit their Fragrant Vapours.

The Women that carry the Water about the Streets, will not walk abroad with∣out these Ornaments upon them. Some tie up the Hair of their Heads, and put it under a hollow large piece of Silver, rais'd somewhat like a Bell, gilt, and neatly embellisht on the outside, and fasten'd to the Crown of their Heads. Some wear Ear-rings all round their Ears, which for Ornament's sake will dangle sometimes almost down to their Shoulders, and have Bracelets about their Necks and Arms, and Rings a∣bout their Wrists, and on every Fin∣ger. Some adorn themselves with Breast Jewels, form'd in Fashion of a Heart, compos'd of variety of Dia∣monds, Rubies, Saphirs, and other Stones of Esteem; and on their Fore-Heads wear a Gold Bodkin, broad at the end, beset with glittering Diamonds,

And some of the Gentile Sects, before they feel any great Warmth of this amorous Passion, are by their Parents join'd to∣gether in their very Infancy, at three or four Years of Age. From which time they endeavour mutually to kindle this tender Passion, till the growing Years blow it up into a lively Flame. And by a thousand little Tricks and Arts of Love they endeavour to stamp their Affections upon their Infant Souls, which like melted Wax are pliant and easie to receive the Impression, and so they are insensibly captivated by each others Snares. The young Lover wins upon his Mistresses Passions by frequent Visits, large Presents, and munificent Gifts, whilst her soft Looks and Inno∣cent Air form his Mind into kind and amorous Inclinations towards her. And thus being happily prepossessed with a mutual good liking, even as it were from the Womb, as if they had been
<PB N="323" REF="173"/>
born Lovers, they are taken off from all Objects, and freed from the Disappoint∣ments of fickle Mistresses, and from being wearied with whining Addresses to coy Damsels.

For what could fix their Affe∣ctions more than the cherishing of them in their tender Years, and digest∣ing them with their Mother's Milk? Or form their Embrio Passions into more Strength and Duration, than con∣fining them early to such an Object, as might receive their entire good liking, before ever they were distracted by va∣rious volatile Affections?</P>
<P>But the Reason alledg'd by them for these Infant Marriages, is, because
<PB N="324" REF="174"/>
they esteem it a matter of more De∣cency to approach their Brides in their purer state, before they come to riper Years. And for hastening the young Mistress's Maturity for the Conjugal Embraces, great Care is taken of a pro∣per Diet, and that she feed plentifully upon Milk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Milk very nourishing.</NOTE> boil'd two or three Quarts into one, which they find by Experience is very nourishing, and ripens them for being fit to come together at Ele∣ven or Twelve. The Husband drinks largely of melted Butter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melted Butter drunk by the <HI>Banni∣ans.</HI> No Women allow'd second Marriages.</NOTE> which he finds very apt to invigorate his Spirits, and makes use of it as Oil to his Flame.</P>
<P>Second Marriages, which are in∣dulg'd to the Men, are solemnly pro∣hibited the Women, because this enga∣ges their Fidelity so much the more to the first Lovers, in that they are de∣barr'd all Hopes and Prospect of all o∣thers. But with this Additional Seve∣rity upon the young Maids, whose Hus∣bands die before they cohabit, that they are obliged to a disconsolate Virginity all the Days of their Lives; and must never contract with another Man, tho' they are unfortunately Widows at Six or Seven Years of Age.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="174"/>Polygamy likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polygamy permitted to the Hus∣bands.</NOTE> besides second Marriages, is allowed the wanton Hus∣bands, who notwithstanding are not often so very Amorous as to prosecute that Liberty, or rather Thraldom, to more Wives than one at once. The na∣ture of the Climate inclines them much to this Amorous Passion, which stings them with impatient Desires, and makes them restless by Delays; and yet tho' Marriage upon this account is so very necessary and agreeable, they do not think that the variety of Women will compensate for the double Burthen and Inconvenience of them in a Family; nor do they imagin that it's worth their while to satisfie the fervour of their wandring Desires, that is attended with such a train of mischievous Consequen∣ces. A merry <HI>Bannian</HI> was wont often to complain of this Folly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The incon∣venience of Poligamy.</NOTE> of engaging with two Wives at once, and ventu∣ring too hastily upon a double Marri∣age, because the fondness of the two Wives provoked them to continual Feuds and Jealousies.

extraordinary. When he was wheedled into a liking of the one, the other would pout and ask him if he meant to forsake her? And if he was going that way, would hold him by the Coat, and pull him back to her. This urg'd to him, that she was the Wife of his Youth, that they had contracted a long and intimate ac∣quaintance, and his first solemn En∣gagements were made to her: The o∣ther replies to him, that she now ought to partake more liberally of his Fa∣vours, and his Thoughts should incline more kindly towards her, since the o∣ther possess'd him so long before.

Worms and Putrefaction; whereof Fire being an Enemy, and the Emblem and most sensible Hieroglyphick of Im∣mortality, there can be no better Ex∣pedient to secure our Friends from Obli∣vion, than that of burning their Bo∣dies, whereof we have either the Bones or Ashes Left, which may be preserved whole Ages.

to them of any such horrid Impiety, as to burn their Fathers Carkasses, and to deny them the Honour of a Natural Burial in the Bowels of their dear Chil∣dren. This shews how Custom is the Spirit and Genius of a Man's Actions, and introduces a Nature and Religion it self: and were the Prejudice of that remov'd, other civiliz'd Nations might doubtless be as zealous for burning their dead Friends, as the <HI>Bannians</HI> are now-a-days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Four ways of disposing of their Dead a∣mong the <HI>Siamese.</HI></NOTE>The Four Elements were formerly worshipped by the ancient <HI>Siamese,</HI> who committed their Bodies, when dead, to what they ador'd when they were alive.

This Care of Mens Bodies after Death seems natural to Mankind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Nati∣ons take care of their Dead.</NOTE> and almost universal; which <HI>Osiris</HI> King of <HI>Egypt</HI> taking notice of, made use of as an Encouragement to Vertue, and an Argument for the

<P>Six Years are now elapsed since a violent Pestilence first broke out among the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Suratt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A tedious Pestilence at <HI>Suratt.</HI></NOTE> and has raged without interruption from the time of its first rise, tho not always with equal fury; for as it had some sort of Inter∣val, in the times of the <HI>Mussouns,</HI> which cool'd the Air; so its greatest Paro∣xysms were always immediately before, and after that Season of the Year. Before the Rains fall, the Air is extreme dry and parching, and when they are fallen, such store of hot unwholsome vapours are rais'd and scatter'd in the Air, that they give Birth to more Diseases, than all the Year besides produces. Above an Hundred <HI>Gentiles</HI> in one of these Sea∣sons were carried out of the Gates of this City one Morning to be Burnt, besides the <HI>Moors</HI> which were carried off by the Plague, and those of both Casts which died in the Suburbs; which by a very modest Calculation will a∣mount
<PB N="348" REF="186"/>
to the number of 300 a Day. And yet the Inhabitants are very nu∣merous still, the Streets populous, and there is but little appearance of any such violent Destruction of the Natives. Before the Eruption of this Pestilence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Earth∣quake.</NOTE> there happen'd a small Earthquake, which alarm'd the People, but without the Ruin of Houses, or mortal effect to any Inhabitant. But that which cre∣ates the greatest Admiration in the <HI>Moors,</HI> and not a little Joy in the <HI>English,</HI> is our escaping all this while the dire∣ful Influence of this mortal Disease, so that not one <HI>English</HI> man was ever yet affected by it. This makes the Hea∣thens cry out, that God is among us, whilst they observe whole Families of their own swept away, without the least Infection touching any one of our Nation; they observe those menial Servants that attend us, both con∣stantly in our Chambers, and in all publick places, falling Dead within a few Hours after they have left our pre∣sence; and both the Wives and Chil∣dren of these persons that wait upon us, languishing at home of this Pestilential Sickness, whilst we all escape its hor∣rid
<PB N="349" REF="186"/>
Mortal Blasts. And tho' I cannot in this case but ascribe something to second Causes, to the generous Wines and costly Dishes, to the strength of that Aliment whereon we feed; yet when I consider how languid and feeble several of the <HI>English</HI> are at sometimes of the Year, and notwithstanding their Food, much less vigorous and Athle∣tick in their Bodies than the <HI>Indians,</HI> and therefore less able to repel a con∣tagious Disease; I think there is some Reason for the Pious Opinion of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> and that the Almighty displays an extraordinary Power in our Preser∣vation.</P>

And that the Reader may see that their extraordinary Skill in Magical Operations is not yet va∣nisht, I will here relate a Story of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Story of a strange Prediction of a <HI>Bra∣min.</HI></NOTE> which I remember was often publickly repeated by the last President at <HI>Su∣ratt, Bartholomew Harris,</HI> concerning a certain <HI>Bramin,</HI> in the time of the Pre∣sidency of Mr. <HI>Aungers,</HI> who foretold the Arrival of a certain <HI>English</HI> Ship se∣veral Months before she came to the Harbour. President <HI>Aungers</HI> being un∣der a Disturbance of Mind, and op∣press'd with some perplex'd Thoughts for want of Intelligence from <HI>England,</HI> was desir'd by the <HI>Bramin</HI> Physician, who observ'd his Grief, and the me∣lancholy of his Spirit, the Reason of his Concern and dejected Looks, with a
<PB N="354" REF="189"/>
chearful Tender of his Service, and Wil∣lingness to administer to him in any thing that might contribute to the re∣moval of his Malady, and to his Cure. The President told him, that it was be∣yond the Power of Physick to heal his Disease, or abate that Distemper he labour'd under; that no Cordial could revive his Thoughts, but News from <HI>England;</HI> or chear his Heart, except it were the sight of an <HI>English</HI> Ship, which he had long expected, but now despairs of. <HI>If an</HI> English <HI>Ship then,</HI> says the <HI>Bramin, is your only Cure, be pleased to give me leave to be absent for three or four Days, and I question not by that time but to remove your Trouble, and bring you undoubted News of that Medicine you long for.</HI> Upon which the President consented to his Departure for that time, and withal promis'd him as an Encouragement to his Skill, a rich Pa∣ramin, or Indian Mantle, for a Reward. Within Four Days the <HI>Bramin</HI> returns, and addressing himself to the President, assur'd him, that at such a time an <HI>English</HI> Ship would arrive at <HI>Suratt</HI> Ri∣ver's Mouth, with such a particular Person, who had formerly been in <HI>In∣dia,</HI>
<PB N="355" REF="189"/>
on board her; and that on such a particular Day of the Month he would arrive at the Custom-House of <HI>Suratt,</HI> before Eleven in the Morning. The President pleas'd with this Assurance, and this confident Relation of the <HI>Bra∣min</HI> diverted himself with the thoughts of it for some time, and a little after rehears'd it jocularly at a publick Din∣ner to all the Factors. The Young Men who heard this Discourse, did sometime after recollect with them∣selves, as they were walking down the Banks of the River to enjoy the Morn∣ing Breeze, that this was the critical Morning foretold by the <HI>Bramin,</HI> when an <HI>English</HI> Ship should arrive, and such a particular Person in her. The Thoughts of it hasten'd them back a∣gain towards the Custom-House, to en∣quire if there were any <HI>English</HI> News; and upon their Return were surpriz'd at the sight of an <HI>English</HI> Boat, which they espyed was rowing up the River; and were no sooner arrived at the Cu∣stom-House, but they found the <HI>English</HI> Man who had been expected in her. The News of this was very grateful to the President, and not ungrateful to
<PB N="356" REF="190"/>
the <HI>Bramin,</HI> who received a curious Pa∣ramin from the Hands of the Gover∣nour, whom he had oblig'd with so faithful and particular a Prophetick Re∣lation.</P>
<P>And the worthy President Mr. <HI>Har∣ris,</HI> who had himself been sometimes in distress for <HI>English</HI> News, has like∣wise told me of a <HI>Bramin</HI>'s Proposals to him, of bringing him undoubted In∣telligence, how the Companies Affairs in <HI>England</HI> stood, within the space of four days. But that he durst not ac∣cept of the Proposition, because he was confident that it depended upon the Assistance of a Familiar. And surely those sprightly Beings can easily dis∣patch a very tedious Voyage in a ve∣ry short time. For if we only consi∣der the nimble progress of Light thro' the Air, with what swiftness it darts its bright active Atoms from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West,</HI> and flies thro' the immense Ex∣panse from the lofty Regions of the Skie; we cannot with any great Rea∣son deny this same or greater Power to the active Spirits of Darkness, who are stript of all the Clogs of Matter, and void of all material Substance.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="190"/>The <HI>Bannians</HI> are far from any thing of Severity, and not prone to the in∣flicting any Corporal Punishments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The re∣proach of being slip∣per'd.</NOTE> and have a perfect Antipathy to those that are Capital; but the ignomi∣nious Punishment which they all sorely dread, is Slippering; that is, when any Person, who has been offended by a <HI>Bannian,</HI> takes off his Slipper, spitts upon it, and then strikes the <HI>Bannian</HI> with the sole of it.

<P>TWO Miles distant from <HI>Suratt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pulpar∣rock,</HI> fre∣quented by the <HI>Fa∣quirs.</HI></NOTE> is a very delightful place, nam'd <HI>Pulparrock,</HI> adorn'd with pleasant Walks and Groves of Trees, near the gentle Streams of the River <HI>Tappy.</HI> The Ground is all very even, except only near the Banks of the River, where the rising Hills enlarge the prospect up∣on the Water. And the Hot Air is temper'd by the shady Walks under the spreading Branches, and the near∣ness of the Current of the Water glide∣ing by. For these Religious <HI>Santones</HI>
<PB N="360" REF="193"/>
here, as well as in <HI>Europe,</HI> are indu∣strious in culling out the most delight∣ful Habitations in the Country, and taking up their Abode where ever ei∣ther Art or Nature Invite, their Resi∣dence by a commodious pleasant Dwel∣ling. For there is not any place near <HI>Suratt,</HI> that yields either the Beauty, or the Delight that <HI>Pulparrock</HI> affords.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Origi∣nal of the <HI>Faquirs.</HI></NOTE>The Original of these Holy Mendi∣cants is ascrib'd, according to their Ac∣count, to a certain Prince named <HI>Revan,</HI> who quarrell'd with <HI>Ram,</HI> a Knowing and Victorious Prince; and being Con∣quer'd and depriv'd of all by a certain Ape named <HI>Herman,</HI> or <HI>Hanneman,</HI> which was his Assistant on Earth, spent the remainder of his Days in Pilgri∣mage, and rambling, without any Main∣tenance either to himself or his Follow∣ers, but what was given them in Cha∣rity: It was for the good Services done to <HI>Ram</HI> in his Life time by the Apes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Indi∣an</HI>'s respect for Apes.</NOTE> that they are in so great Esteem both with the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Gentues</HI> in the <HI>In∣dies;</HI> and this arch unlucky Creature is in that Repute among them all, that they seriously declare, <HI>were the Blood of one of them spilt upon the Ground, the
<PB N="361" REF="193"/>
Earth would suddenly become unfruitful, and the Judgment upon it would be at least a Years Famin.</HI> And therefore when a large Ape had broke loose from the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Factory at <HI>Suratt,</HI> and skipping to and fro' had snatch'd away several things of value, and in his Anger had bit a Child or two so sorely, that they afterwards died of the Wounds, (as it was reported,) yet was it an inexcu∣sable Crime at the same time for any violent Hand to touch him.</P>
<P>These Philosophical Saints have since the first forming of their Order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rude∣ness of the <HI>Faquirs.</HI></NOTE> as∣sum'd a liberty of taking that by vio∣lence, which they find is denied their civil Requests, and sometimes force a Charity from the People, when Intrea∣ties cannot prevail, especially in the Country Villages. For their numbers render them imperious, and upon pre∣tension of extraordinary Sanctity, they commit a thousand Villanies unbecom∣ing their Profession. They imitate the <HI>Romish</HI> Orders in Vows of Piety and Celibacy, and in their Pretensions to a strange Intimacy, and prevailing Interest with Heaven. Thus they en∣deavour to raise their Veneration and
<PB N="362" REF="194"/>
Respect; thus they acquire constant Homage and Address, daily Applica∣tions, and large Presents from the People. And some, by a seeming neglect of themselves, indulge their Bodies, and pamper their Ambition the more.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fil∣thiness.</NOTE>They are called <HI>Faquirs</HI> by the Na∣tives, but <HI>Ashmen</HI> commonly by us, because of the abundance of Ashes with which they powder their Heads, and mix with their Hair, which falls down sometimes to the middle of their Backs. They use no Pillabers to repose their Heads on, but lay them unconcernedly upon the Ground, where they gather a constant supply of Dust and Filth, which makes them (in their Opinion) of a very becoming appearance, because it is squalid, but gives the Ascetick or vo∣tary in our Eyes a very disagreeable and sordid Aspect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Immo∣desty of some <HI>Fa∣quirs.</HI></NOTE>Of this Persuasion and kind of life, are several sorts both among the <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> and the <HI>Moors;</HI> some of whom shew their Devotion by a shameless ap∣pearance, and walking naked, without the least Rag of Cloaths to cover them. And even at Mid-day, and in the heart of the City, and places of chief Con∣course,
<PB N="363" REF="194"/>
will they walk the Streets, as shameless and unconcern'd, as if they were Cloathed all over. The constant sight of them in the City, which offers it self at every turn, abates that bash∣fulness in the Spectators, which such an immodesty might be apt to create, and diverts neither Sex from their So∣ciety, from a familiar Conversation and Intimacy with them; and Custom has wore off all that Coyness even in the Women, which would be startled at such an immodest Spectacle at first.</P>
<P>Others make solemn Vows of con∣tinuance in such and such kind of Po∣stures all the days of their life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The several tormenting Postures of these <HI>Fa∣quirs.</HI></NOTE> and will never move from them or alter them, tho' the Pains are never so vio∣lent, which seem to be attended with so much Torture, as would even force them to forbear. For these are Peni∣tentiaries in earnest, without any Mask or possible appearance of Deceit, and voluntarily mortifie their Limbs, and distort their Joints to a perfect Disloca∣tion. For by the Delusions of Satan, these infatuated Votaries are possessed with a wretched Opinion of making themselves unspeakably happy hereaf∣ter
<PB N="364" REF="195"/>
by these insufferable Torments here: And the Enemy of Mankind, impatient of Delays in exercising his infernal Cruelty, persuades them to undergo these Torments which will end in making them Meritorious Saints, and that by these horrid Pu∣nishments they may secure a future larger Bliss.</P>
<P>Among these violent Postures, some I observ'd with both their Arms stretcht out toward Heaven continu∣ally, which they never let fall, and are therefore by long use grown so much into that Position, that by long continuance it begins to grow Natu∣ral, and without Violence they can∣not move them downward. The Nails from their Fingers too, are grown be∣yond the Paws of any Lyon, into three or four Inches length, (by an O∣pinion which they have imbibed, like that of the Emperour of <HI>Japan,</HI> who, after his Coronation, is deterr'd from permitting either Razor or Scissers to come near his Hair or Nails,) upon a Persuasion that it is a kind of Sacri∣ledge in those cases to cut them.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="195"/>Others, as devout as these, gaze with their Eyes continually toward Heaven, by holding their Faces, directly up∣wards. They throw their Heads so far backwards between their Shoulders, that their Eyes can never behold any other Object but the Stars and Sky, whither with unwearied Earnestness they look continually, delighted as it were with the pleasant sight of the bles∣sed Regions above, and loath to cast their Eyes upon any thing of this vile and wicked World. But before their Eyes can be thus fixt, and their Heads setled in this Posture, the <HI>Faquirs</HI> run thro' much Uneasiness and Trouble, molested both in the Utterance of their Words, and in receiving any Food. And both those who extend their Arms con∣tinually towards Heaven, as if they were reaching at that place; and those whose Eyes are constantly fixt upwards, are rendred thereby wholly unservicea∣ble to themselves, and are therefore attended always by a Servant or two, who administer to them in their Ne∣cessities, and conduct the gazing Saints to different places of Abode.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="196"/>Others there are with their Right Arm brought round the Neck over the left Shoulder, and the Left Arm over the Right Shoulder, and their Fingers clasping one another before their Breasts, with the Palms of their Hands turn'd outwards. This twists the Arms, dislocates the Shoulder-bones, and there∣fore vexes the Patient with inexpressi∣ble Torments.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Faquirs</HI> neither sit, nor ever lie down, but constantly either walk or lean. They lean upon a small Pillow, or Quilt, laid upon a Rope, which hangs down from the Boughs of a Tree, where the two Ends are fast∣ned above, and swing in that posture to and fro Day and Night. But when these <HI>Faquirs</HI> prepare themselves to pray, they change this Gesture, and fasten their Feet in two Ropes that hang down from the Boughs of a Tree, and with their Heels upwards, and their Heads down, as if they were a∣sham'd to lift up their Eyes to Heaven, they pour out their powerful Supplica∣tions. And from the Prayers of these humble Saints are expected to flow considerable Blessings, and the preven∣tion of many Mischiefs.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="196"/>Some of these devoted Mendicants extend only one Hand toward Heaven, others turn only one Arm round their Shoulders. But they are all in singular Esteem, and religiously resorted to by the Vulgar; and by these Distortions of their Bodies they gain the Repute of Men of perfect Hearts and of upright Minds.</P>
<P>Besides these painful unnatural Po∣stures near <HI>Suratt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A savage Custom near <HI>Car∣war.</HI></NOTE> a savage Custom is still maintain'd by the Gentiles near <HI>Carwar,</HI> in offering Sacrifice to the God of Plenty, at the Season of the growing Corn. The <HI>Bramins</HI> at this time kill a Cock, and make an Oblation of his Blood, as was usual with other Hea∣thens; while the People that are con∣cern'd in it are struck with amazing Horror and Consternation, their Faces are writhed, and their Looks ghastly; their Flesh creeps upon them, and their Joints tremble; and to all Men they appear frightful, as if they were pos∣sessed; and they own too, that the De∣vil at that time inhabits them, and acquaints them with several strange things. After the Sacrifice is past, Six Men, and an equal number of Women,
<PB N="368" REF="197"/>
are appointed to perform a Ceremony very dreadful. Upon each side of the Back-bone of the Men are stuck two Iron Hooks into the Flesh, by which they are lifted up to the top of a Pole standing out like a Gibbet, above 20 Foot high. This Gibbet is fasten'd to an Engine with four Wheels, which is drawn upon the Ground above a Mile, with the Men hanging upon the Ten∣ters all the way. The Women have each of them a sort of Bason upon their Heads, upon which are set Six Cups as large as Tea-Cups, one upon another, with Fire in each of them, which being very tottering, makes the Women ex∣ceding careful how they tread; lest if they slip, and thereby any Cup falls, or the Fire be shaken out of any, the Woman forfeits her Life, and is sen∣tenc'd to immediate Death. But if with Care and Dexterity they go thro' with the Walk as far as the Men, they then are safe, and the Solemnity ceases. And notwithstanding all the tediousness of the Passage, and the jogging of the Carriage whereon they hang, which one would think would force the Hooks to tear the Flesh in pieces; yet will the
<PB N="369" REF="197"/>
Men, poor miserable Wretches! take Swords and brandish them in their Hands, as it were, in defiance of their Torments all the way</P>
<P>The <HI>Faquirs</HI> resort sometimes toge∣ther in great numbers, and live upon the Spoil and Alms of the Country, as they pass in their Pilgrimage. If they find the People unwilling to give, they audaciously demand, and that not in the humble strain for a Pice or two, but sawcily beg a Roupie. One of these Mendicants in a petulant Humour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Story of a sawcy <HI>Faquir.</HI></NOTE> im∣pudently requested from an <HI>English</HI> Pre∣sident, whom he met abroad, twenty Roupies. The President to humour his Forwardness and Impudence, offer'd him Nineteen, which he magnanimously refused, because he thought it unbe∣coming his Greatness, to sink a Far∣thing below his first demands.</P>
<P>Of these Imperious Godly Beggars, I have seen an hundred (at least) of them in a Company, seated under a shady Grove of Trees, rejoycing at a publick Entertainment, which was pre∣par'd by a leading Man of their Com∣pany. I observ'd that they drunk very freely of Bang, steep'd in Water, while
<PB N="370" REF="198"/>
I stood among them, whose Intoxica∣ting quality is very apt to disturb the Brain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Fa∣quirs</HI> very orderly at their Feasts</NOTE> Which made me enquire whe∣ther such Jovial Meetings were not apt to end in Madness and Quarrels; and the Excess of that Liquor, by kin∣dling an unruly Heat, disturb their Spi∣rits, and convert their friendly Meet∣ings into feuds and discords, and mis∣chievous Debates? To which they an∣swer'd, That they took care of pre∣serving Peace and Amity, and as much decency and order at these times of Mirth, as at their ordinary Meetings; for which end, they chose a number from among themselves, who were to∣tally debarr'd from Drinking, and were Censors upon others, to inspect their Carriage, and interpose in their Disputes, to restrain them from all ex∣orbitant Mirth, and excessive Drink∣ing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Persies</HI></NOTE>Besides the <HI>Moors</HI> and the <HI>Bannians,</HI> and these <HI>Faquirs,</HI> which belong to both Professions, the <HI>Persies</HI> are a Sect very considerable in <HI>India,</HI> of whom the Tradition is, that coming from <HI>Persia</HI> in a Tempest, at the time that <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his Followers gave Laws
<PB N="371" REF="198"/>
to the <HI>Persians,</HI> (which they were unwil∣ling to submit to) they were driven to that distress, that they almost despair'd of Life, 'till hearing a Cock Crow, and espying Fire at Land, they recover'd their hopes of safety, and gain'd a spee∣dy Arrival. The Cock therefore is as much esteem'd by them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Re∣spect to a Cock and to Fire.</NOTE> as the Cow is by the <HI>Bannians,</HI> of the lives of both which, they are the zealous Patrons and Protectors. For the Worshipping of Fire seems to be the Ancientest instance of Idolatry in the World, inasmuch (as some think) that <HI>Cain,</HI> after he was ba∣nished from the Presence of the Lord, turned a downright Idolater, and then introduced the Worship of the Sun, as the best resemblance he could find of the Glory of the Lord, which was wont to appear in a flaming Light. And in after-times, they Worshipped Fire in the Eastern Countries, as the best Em∣blem of the Sun, when it was absent. Nor was the Vestal Fire ever more Sa∣cred, than all other Fires are with the <HI>Persies,</HI> the extinction of which, if it is voluntary, is a Crime as hainous, as if the vital Heat of the Cock, or some other beloved Animal were destroy'd;
<PB N="372" REF="199"/>
so that if their Houses were on Fire, they would sooner be persuaded to pour on Oyl to increase, than Water to as∣swage the Flame. If a Candle is once lighted, they would judge the Breath of him more than Pestilential, that durst attempt to blow it out. And a <HI>Persy</HI> Servant, who is commanded to bring a hot Steel, and warm with it a Bowl of Punch, will plead his Excuse, and that he dare not hasten the coolness of the Steel by a violent abatement of the Heat. The active Flame must be al∣low'd to live, whilst there's any Fuel for it to feed on; if the Fire is once kindled, all care is taken that it comes to a natural Expiration, and no vio∣lence allow'd to bring it to a period sooner. Another account we have for their respect for Fire, is, that their great Law-giver <HI>Zertoost,</HI> was taken into Heaven, and brought from thence Fire with him (<HI>Prometheus</HI> like) which he commanded his Followers after∣wards to Worship.</P>
<P>They have other Fables concerning <HI>Abraham,</HI> that he was once in the De∣vil's Power, who expos'd him to the Flames, but the kind Fire would not
<PB N="373" REF="199"/>
fasten on him; from which they infer the great unreasonableness of destroy∣ing that Element, which was so averse, (notwithstanding all its Fury) from hurting <HI>Abraham</HI> their Friend;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their days of Devotion.</NOTE> the Reason of this may be, because that <HI>A∣braham</HI> came from the Land of <HI>Ʋz,</HI> which signifies Fire, which might give the occasion for the Fable of his E∣scaping the Fire.</P>
<P>They own and Adore one Supreme Being, to whom, as he is the Original of all things; they dedicate the first Day of every Month, in a solemn ob∣servance of his Worship. And enjoin, besides these, some others for the Cele∣bration of Publick Prayers.</P>
<P>At their solemn Festivals, whither an hundred or two sometimes resort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eating in common.</NOTE> in the Suburbs of the City, each Man according to his Fancy and Ability, brings with him his Victuals, which is equally distributed, and eat in common by all that are present. For they shew a firm Affection to all of their own Sentiments in Religion, assist the Poor, and are very ready to provide for the Sustenance and Comfort of such as want it.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tran∣sportation to <HI>India.</HI></NOTE>These <HI>Persies</HI> are by another Name term'd <HI>Gaures,</HI> or Worshippers of Fire, because of their Veneration for that E∣lement; and were Transported into <HI>India,</HI> when <HI>Calyf Omar</HI> reduc'd the Kingdom of <HI>Persia,</HI> under the Power of the <HI>Mahometans;</HI> and they profess the Ancient Religion of the <HI>Persians.</HI> But their Religion spread it self more We∣sterly, it seems than <HI>Persia;</HI> for the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> who by their Religious Discipline, were engag'd to the Wor∣shipping the Sun, did likewise under the Names of <HI>Nego,</HI> and <HI>Shaca,</HI> Adore the Fire and the Earth.

<P>I shall not mention their Marriages, which much resemble the manner of the <HI>Bannians,</HI> but proceed only to a Description of their way of Burying, which is this.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their dead Bodies ex∣pos'd to the Birds of Prey.</NOTE> The noblest Sepulture which they fancy they can bestow up∣on their deceased Friends, is exposing them to be devour'd by the Fowls of the Air, and bestowing their Carcasses on the Birds of Prey.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cere∣mony used by the <HI>Per∣sies</HI> in their Burials.</NOTE> After the Bo∣dy is for some time dead, the <HI>Halal∣chors</HI> (which area sort of sordid <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>) take and carry it out upon a Bier into the open Fields, near the place where it is expos'd to the Fowls of Heaven. When 'tis there decently de∣posited upon the Ground, a particular Friend bears the Fields and neighbour∣ing Villages, upon the hunt for a Dog, 'till he can find one out; and having had the good luck to meet him, he cherishes and intices him with a Cake of Bread, which he carries in his Hand for that purpose, 'till he draws him as near the Corps as he is able; for
<PB N="377" REF="201"/>
the nearer the Dog is brought to the dead Body, the nearer are its approach∣es to Felicity. And if the hungry Cur can by bits of Cake be brought so nigh the Deceased, as to come up to him, and take a piece cut of his Mouth, 'tis then an unquestionable Sign, that the Condition he died in was very hap∣py; but if the timorous Dog startles at the sight, or loaths the Object, or being lately well fed, has no Stomach to that ordinary Morsel, which he must snatch out of the dead Man's Jaws, the Case then with him is desperate, and his state deplorable. The poor Man whom I saw, was by these Pro∣gnosticks, very miserable; for the stur∣dy Cur would by no means be inticed to any distance near him. When the Dog has finisht his part of the Cere∣mony, two <HI>Daroos,</HI> at a Furlong's di∣stance from the Bier, stand up with joined Hands, and loudly repeat for near half an hour, a tedious Form of Prayer by Heart; but with such a quick dispatch, that they scarce drew Breath all the while, as if they had been under some invincible necessity of running over the Words in such a time.
<PB N="378" REF="202"/>
All the while they were thus gabling, a piece of White Paper fasten'd to each Ear, o'rethwart the Face, hung down two or three Inches below the Chin; and as soon as they had ended their Petitions, the <HI>Halalchors</HI> took up the Corps, and conveyed it to the Re∣pository, which was near; all the Com∣pany ranking themselves by two and two, and following it with joined Hands. The place of Sepulture is in the open Fields, within a Wall built in form of a Circle, about twelve Foot high, and about an hundred in the Cir∣cumference; in the middle of which was a Door of Stone about six foot from the ground, which was open'd to ad∣mit the Corps. The Ground within the Walls is rais'd above four Foot, and made shelving towards the Corner, that the Filth and Moisture which are drain'd continually from the Car∣casses, may by an easie passage descend into a Sink made in the middle to re∣ceive them. The Corps therefore was left here, and all the Company depart∣ing thence, betook themselves to a Ri∣volet that run near the place for Ablu∣tion, to cleanse themselves from what
<PB N="379" REF="202"/>
defilements, on this Melancholy occa∣sion, they might have contracted; and retir'd afterwards to their proper Habi∣tations in the City, from whence this place is distant about a Mile. But with∣in the space of a Day or two after, some of the nearest Relatives return a∣gain hither, to observe which of the Eyes of their deceased Friend was first pickt out by the hungry Vultures; and if they find that the right Eye was first seis'd on, this abodes undoubted Hap∣piness; if the left, they then are sorrow∣ful, for that's a direful sign of his Mi∣sery.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persies</HI> are very nice in the pre∣servation of their Hair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Burying of their Hair every Year.</NOTE> and careful to preserve whatever is cut off their Heads or Beards, that nothing of it be lost or carelesly thrown about, but once a Year be decently laid in their Burying place. A description of which, tho' it be drest with nothing but Horrour, yet may here properly be inserted.</P>
<P>The Burying-place of the <HI>Persies</HI> is an Object the most dreadful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Persies</HI> horrid Bu∣rying-place.</NOTE> and of the most horrid Prospect in the World, and much more frightful than a Field of Slaughter'd Men. It contains a numb∣er
<PB N="380" REF="203"/>
of Carcasses of very different disa∣greeable Colours and Aspects. Some are seen there bleeding fresh, but so torn by the Vultures that croud upon the Walls, that their Faces resemble that of a Death's Head, with the Eye∣balls out, and all the Flesh upon the Cheeks pickt off. And on the Fleshy part of the Body, where the Ravenous Bird tasted a more delicious Morsel, are eaten several large Holes, and all the Skin on every part is mangled, and torn by the sharp Beaks of these devouring Creatures. Here was a Leg, and there an Arm, here lay half, and there the quarter of a Man, Some look'd as if they were partly Jelly, others were harden'd like Tann'd Leather, by the various operations of the Sun and Wea∣ther upon them: Here lay one pickt as clean as a Skeleton, near that, another with the Skin in some parts Green, in o∣thers Yellow, and the whole so disco∣loured, as if all within were Putrefa∣ction. A sight terrible enough almost to afright an hungry Vulture from his Prey. But these Birds are most de∣lighted with these dismal Objects, and that noisom smell which evaporates
<PB N="381" REF="203"/>
from the dead Corps affords a pleasant Odour to their Senses. The stench of the Bodies is intolerable, and of ma∣lignity sufficient to strike any Man dead that would endure it; and yet the Vul∣tures chuse to fit to the Leeward upon the Wall, luxuriously to suck up and indulge their smell with these deadly foul Vapours. Some of these glutted Birds were so cloy'd and cramm'd with Humane Flesh, that they seem'd scarce able to take Wing, and the Feathers of others were much moulted away, by this kind of rank feeding.</P>
<P>Besides this manner of Burying, in use with the <HI>Persies,</HI> near <HI>Suratt,</HI> there are other Eastern Nations who have peculiarly affected the Intombing their dead Bodies in Animals. The Inha∣bitants of <HI>Pegu</HI> reckon him happy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two odd ways of Burying.</NOTE> whose Fate it is to be devour'd by a Croco∣dile. And the Natives formerly, near the Mouth of <HI>Ganges,</HI> if weary of this Life by Sickness or Old Age, commit∣ted themselves to be devoured by the Dog-Fish, as the safest passage to their future Felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="204"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Halal∣chors</HI> a sor∣did sort of People.</NOTE>The <HI>Halalchors,</HI> (whom I occasional∣ly mention'd a little before) are ano∣ther sort of <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Suratt,</HI> the most contemptible, but extremely necessary to be there. They are term'd <HI>Halal∣chors,</HI> by the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Language, which signifies <HI>Eat∣alls,</HI> or <HI>Eaters at large.</HI> They will in∣dulge themselves with Wine, as well as drink Water; they Eat all kinds of Fish or Flesh, and without any scruple of Conscience or of Appetite, will feed upon either Horse or Cow, and will satisfie their Stomachs as well with a piece of Carrion out of a Ditch, as with the freshest Meat that can be bought in the <HI>Bazar.</HI> These are the Persons employ'd in sweeping the Hou∣ses, and cleaning the Streets, in carry∣ing away the Dirt and Dung, in wash∣ing the dead Bodies, and conveying them to their proper places of Sepul∣ture, which makes them absolutely ne∣cessary in these parts, because such Em∣ployments as these are an Abominati∣on to the <HI>Moors</HI> and defile the <HI>Banni∣ans,</HI> and are only ingag'd in by these poor People, who for this Reason are accounted Vile and Mean, the most ab∣ject

The <HI>Halalchor</HI> industriously a∣voids the touching of any Person for fear of Offence; he is separated from all the rest of the <HI>Casts,</HI> as a thing Un∣clean; for if he happens to come too near a <HI>Bannian,</HI> he defiles him by his touch, and puts him to the trouble of some Purification, to wash off the De∣filement he contracted upon it. There∣fore are they shunn'd by all, and en∣deavour to keep at a distance from all.</P>

<PB N="386" REF="206"/>
Honour of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, as faci∣litating of their Traffick, to maintain their principal Servants in <HI>India,</HI> not only in Decency, but Splendor, as is visible to any that has travell'd either to <HI>Suratt,</HI> or the <HI>Fort</HI> of St. <HI>George,</HI> to <HI>Gombrone</HI> in <HI>Persia,</HI> or <HI>Bengal.</HI> These are the chief places of Note and Trade, where their Presidents and Agents re∣side, for the support of whom, with their Writers and Factors, large Privi∣leges and Salaries are allowed.</P>
<P>The several parts of <HI>India</HI> have each their peculiar Commodities proper to them, which are bought up, and made ready by the Companies Servants, to load upon their Ships at their Arrival. And were not the <HI>English</HI> constantly up∣on this Account kept in those parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The necessi∣ty of <HI>En∣glish</HI> Fa∣ctors in <HI>In∣dia.</HI></NOTE> the other <HI>European</HI> Nations would soon fill up all our vacant Factories, and so monopolize the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade, that not only the Spice Islands would be their darling Propriety, but all <HI>Indian</HI> Commodities as well as Spices, Silks, Callicoes, Drugs, Precious Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should (within a while) be apt to bear what Rates in <HI>Europe</HI> they thought fit to lay upon them. For accomplishing
<PB N="387" REF="206"/>
which design, some People have alrea∣dy some time ago, profer'd to the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> the advancement of his Customs at <HI>Suratt,</HI> to a much higher Rate than now they are at, upon condition of E∣stablishing that intire Trade upon them. And both by large Presents, and by rais∣ing of the Price of Pepper upon the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> they have indefati∣gably endeavour'd a total subversion of our Trade therein among the Natives. Therefore the continuance of Factors in <HI>India</HI> by a Company, seems very ne∣cessary and just; and were this practice once withdrawn, the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade to <HI>England,</HI> would probably soon be re∣mov'd too. For other means would soon be projected for accomplishing what Bribes and Presents to the <HI>Mogul</HI> and his Officers could not effect, by which those that secur'd the Trade for themselves, would soon find a Way of stopping all Traffick from the <HI>Indies,</HI> but what came through their Hands. Therefore are our Presidents oblig'd continually to watch their Motions in <HI>India,</HI> and observe their Designs, to countermine their Projects, and grati∣fie not only the <HI>Mogul</HI> now and then,
<PB N="388" REF="207"/>
with grateful Gifts, but likewise to be always upon the same method with the <HI>Omrahs</HI> and Favorites at Court, inga∣ging a continuance of their Favours.</P>
<P>This makes those that are concern'd in the Trade of <HI>India</HI> think fit, that this necessary Expence of Factors for conti∣nuance of the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade to <HI>England,</HI> should be recompens'd with some pub∣lick Priviledges for its support. And that therefore the private Advantage which grows from this great Care and Cost, should not easily be checkt and discourag'd, especially considering like∣wise that the securing the Traffick in the power of the <HI>English</HI> from Foreign Designers, contributes not a little to the common good, especially if there∣by their Ships be enabled to come home in good Fleets, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> do, which would thereby the better secure them from the common Enemy the <HI>French,</HI> that they might not be so easily Seiz'd to the publick Damage of the Nation.</P>

are earnest Supplicants, and from which they are very strictly restrain'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coun∣cil.</NOTE>The Accountant succeeds the Presi∣dent, next to him is the Store-keeper, and to him the Purser Marine.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Advance∣ments ac∣cording to every ones standing.</NOTE>The Secretary, tho' none of the Coun∣cil, yet always attends their Orders and Consultations, and stands Candidate for the first Vacancy among them; to which all are gradually advanc'd ac∣cording to the Seniority of their time or Station; except the Authority of the Company interposes in their Earlier Exaltation, which they seldom attempt, because as the other method is most e∣quitable, so they find it most suitable to their Affairs and Interest.</P>
<P>The Chaplain, who is respected as third in the Factory, the Senior and Junior Factors, the Writers and Appren∣tices make up the rest. These all re∣main in their various Stations, for three or five Years, or as many as they and the Company have agreed upon at their

first coming out, before they rise to new Degrees, as from Apprentice to Writer, from Writer to Factor. And every step they take in Promotion, the Com∣pany raises their Salary, and allows them some new Privilege. They all have gi∣ven to them their Diet and Lodging gra∣tis by the Company, besides Wages, and the advantagious liberty of Trafick to all parts, wherein from <HI>China</HI> to <HI>Su∣ratt,</HI> they commonly make <HI>Cent per Cent;</HI> they can sometimes mak 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> from thence, if they only carry out Sil∣ver and bring home Gold: And those among them that are Persons of Credit and Esteem, but of small Fortunes, may borrow from the <HI>Bannians</HI> Money for <HI>China</HI> at 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and that only to be paid upon the safe Arrival of the Ship, which if it miscarries in the Voyage, they are exempt from all damage.

who wait daily upon the President in the Morning, that they may receive his Commands for the Service of the Day; and appear before him in a Body in the Evening, to pay him their Ho∣mage, who then (at his pleasure) with a Nodd dismisses them to their Homes in the City. Besides these, the Presi∣dent is allowed for his personal Attend∣ance several others, the Accountant or second is allowed two, the Minister, and the rest of the Council, and the Secretary, each of them one.</P>
<P>The whole Business and Concern of all is zealously to promote the Honour and Interest of the Companies Affairs, in maintaining their Reputation, and vending their Commodities at as high Rates, and buying for them others at as low as they can.</P>

But their Honesty is our security from being da∣mag'd by any Theft, which has not been charg'd upon them in the Factory these many Years: Nay, such is the appro∣ved Honesty and Fidelity of these Ser∣vants to our Affairs, that whenever the President designs to run the Custom of a considerable Sum of Gold or Silver, he commits the secret to some of these Pe∣ons, who manage it dextrously, and are Faithful to a Roupie.</P>
<P>Without Liberty from the President,<NOTE PLACE="marg">None per∣mitted to lie without the Factory.</NOTE> none are permitted to leave the Factory, to lie abroad, or depart into the Coun∣try; and the Porter who attends the

But each <HI>Thursday</HI> Night he craves leave of going home, because he is a <HI>Moor</HI>-man and Married, and he fears that the neglecting a Visit to his Wife for more than a Week, might give an occasion of Complaint. Therefore on this Night the Poor Man that beg in the Streets commonly do it in the pre∣vailing Stile of <HI>Jimroot sab, Jimroot sab;</HI> intimating as much as, Sir, since this is <HI>Thursday</HI> Night, let me (I pray you) par∣take something of your Bounty, as a means the better to inable my Kindness to my Wife.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A publick Table.</NOTE>Each Day there is prepar'd a Publick Table for the Use of the President and the rest of the Factory, who sit all down in a publick place according to their Se∣niority in the Companies Service. The Table is spread with the choicest Meat <HI>Suratt</HI> affords, or the Country therea∣bouts; and equal plenty of generous <HI>Sherash</HI> Wine, and <HI>Arak</HI> Punch, is serv'd round the Table. Several hundreds a Year are expended upon their daily Pro∣visions which are sumptuous enough for
<PB N="395" REF="210"/>
the Entertainment of any Person of E∣minence in the Kingdom; and which require two or three Cooks, and as ma∣ny Butchers to dress and prepare them. But <HI>Europe</HI> Wines and <HI>English</HI> Beer, be∣cause of their former Acquaintance with our Palates, are most coveted and most desirable Liquors, and tho' sold at high Rates, are yet purchased and drunk with pleasure. A Wealthy <HI>Indian</HI> who was curious to see our manner of Eating, and desirous to please himself with the Pride of our Etertainments, was strangely a∣maz'd and surpriz'd at the opening of a Bottle of Bottled Drink, when he saw it froth and fly about. The President askt him what it was that struck him with such Admiration? which was not, he told him, the sight of the Drink fly∣ing out of the Bottle, but how such Li∣quor could ever be put in.</P>
<P>The President and Council only meet at Supper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presi∣dent and Council, only meet at Supper.</NOTE> for the maintenance of a Friendly Correspondence, and to dis∣course of the Companies Business, and prevent all Jealousies and Animosities which might obstruct the publick Af∣fairs from that Progress, which a joint Unanimous Affection might carry them
<PB N="396" REF="211"/>
on with. For the Current of the com∣mon Interest has been sometimes very much lessen'd and diverted by the un∣happy Intervention of private misunder∣standings and Quarrels. And tho' it has been a repeated Contrivance of some leading Men, to play their Servants in <HI>India</HI> one against another, and to set them as Spies of each others Actions, yet I'm sure the publick Affairs have suffer'd when the Design has been un∣mask'd, and the Jealous Eye has been a∣waked. For nothing vexes a Man of Honour, and who is conscious of his own Integrity more, than to find himself sus∣pected of Dishonesty, and Designs laid by those to intrap him in his Actions, who have the least Reason in the World to distrust his Fidelity.</P>
<P>Both before and after Meals, a Peon appointed for that purpose, attends with a large Silver Ewer and Bason, for those that sit down to wash their Hands; which at both times is a Decency in all places, but here necessary, because of the Heat and Dust which are so very troublesome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">All the Dishes and Plates pure Silver.</NOTE> All the Dishes and Plates brought to the Table are of pure Silver, massy and Substantial; and such are al∣so

the Tosses or Cups out of which we drink. And that nothing may be wanting to please the Curiosity of eve∣ry Palate at the times of Eating, an <HI>Eng∣lish, Portuguese,</HI> and an <HI>Indian</HI> Cook, are all entertain'd to dress the Meat in dif∣ferent ways for the gratification of e∣very Stomach. Palau, that is Rice boil'd so artificially, that every grain lies sing∣ly without being added together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several sorts of <HI>In∣dian</HI> Dish∣es.</NOTE> with Spices intermixt, and a boil'd Fowl in the middle, is the most common <HI>Indian</HI> Dish; and a dumpoked Fowl, that is, boil'd with Butter in any small Vessel, and stuft with Raisons and Almonds, is an∣other. Cabob, that is, Bief or Mut∣ton cut into small pieces, sprinkled with Salt and Pepper, and dipt with Oil and Garlick, which have been mixt toge∣ther in a Dish, and then roasted on a Spit, with sweet Herbs put between every piece, and stuft in them, and basted with Oil and Garlick all the while, is another <HI>Indian</HI> Savory Dish. Bambou and Mangoe Achar, and Souy the choicest of all Sawces, are always ready to whet the Appetite. The Na∣tives at <HI>Suratt</HI> are much taken with <HI>Assa Faetida,</HI> which they call Hin, and
<PB N="398" REF="212"/>
mix a little of it with the Cakes that they eat, which tho' very unpalatable and unsavoury, yet because they e∣steem it beyond all things healthful, the <HI>English</HI> are tempted sometimes to taste it. The whole City sometimes smells very strong of the nauseating Vapours which flow from that abun∣dance that is eat in it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Great Entertain∣ments on publick Days.</NOTE>Upon <HI>Sundays</HI> and publick Days, the Entertainments keep up a Face or more Solemnity, and are made more large and splendid, Deer and Antilopes, Pea∣cocks, Hares, Partridges, and all kind of <HI>Persian</HI> Fruits, Pistachoes, Plumbs, Apricocks, Cherries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are all pro∣vided upon high Festivals; and <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI> as well as <HI>Persian</HI> Wines are drunk with Temperance and Alacrity. Then the King's Health, and after∣wards that of the Companies, are sent round the Table to the lowest Writer that sits down. When the Banquett is past, they generally divert themselves for a while with some In∣nocent easie Recreation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The state the Presi∣dent goes a∣broad in.</NOTE>The President upon Solemn Days generally invites the whole Factory a∣broad to some pleasant Garden adja∣cent

to the City, where they may sit shaded from the Beams of the Sun, and refresht by the Neighbourhood of <HI>Tanques</HI> and Water-works. The Pre∣sident and his Lady are brought hi∣ther in Palanquins, supported each of them by six Peons, which carry them by four at once on their Shoul∣ders.

<P>The Furniture of these, and several other Horses, whereon the Factors Ride, is very costly; the Saddles are all of Velvet richly Embroider'd, the Head-stalls, Reins, and Croupers are all cover'd with solid wrought Silver. The Captain of the Peons at this time ascends his Horse, and leads forty or fif∣ty others after him, which attend the President on foot,. Next the Presi∣dent follow the Council in large Coach∣es, all open, except their Wives are in them; the several Knobbs about them are all covered with Silver, and
<PB N="400" REF="213"/>
they are drawn by a Pair of stately Ox∣en. After them succeed the rest of the Factors, either in Coaches, or Hacke∣ries, or upon Horses, which are kept by the Company to accommodate their Pre∣sident, and People at these times, or whenever they fancy to take the Air. In this pompous Procession does the President, when he goes abroad, tra∣vel thro' the Heart of the City.</P>
<P>The Evenings and the Mornings be∣ing allay'd with moderate Breezes, and cool and temperate in respect of the Heat when the Sun is at the Height, invite the Factors daily almost to the Groves or Gardens near the Water side, there to spend an Hour or two with a Bottle of Wine, and cold Collation which they carry with them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Natives respects to the <HI>English</HI> because of the state maintain'd by them.</NOTE> And nei∣ther the Chaplain nor any of the Council stir without the Walls of the City without the attendance of four or five Peons upon the Coach. This creates a Respect from the Natives as they pass along, strikes them with a Regard to the <HI>English</HI> wherever they meet them; makes them value our Friendship, and place an Honour in our Intimacy and Acquaintance. The

<P>Having spoke thus much of <HI>Arabia</HI> in general, of the Extent and Situa∣tion of <HI>Muscatt,</HI> and the quality of its Climate, of the Stature and Comple∣xion of the Inhabitants, and nature of the Soil thereabouts; I will now relate one thing observable concerning the Food of their Cattle, and will then pro∣ceed to an Account of the Temperance and Justice of the <HI>Arabians</HI> of <HI>Muscatt,</HI> for which two things they are more re∣markable than any other Nation this day in the World.</P>
<P>Their Cattle here are fed with Fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fish the Food of their Cat∣tle.</NOTE> which is a sort of Food that seems as Unnatural for them as for Fish to live
<PB N="426" REF="226"/>
upon Grass, which is the proper Meat for Cattle. But the Fish which they eat is not fresh, and just taken out of the Sea, but when a great quantity of it is caught, the <HI>Muscatrers</HI> dig a large Hole in the Ground wherein they put it, 'till it remains so long that it rotts and comes to a kind of Earth. After this it is taken up, and boil'd with Water in great Earthen Pots, which makes a kind of thick Broth; and stand∣ing 'till it is cool, it is then given to the Cattle, by which they grow extreme Fat, and yet their Flesh is very savory, not tainted with either an ill Taste or Smell.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Food of the Na∣tives.</NOTE>The Inhabitants of <HI>Muscatt</HI> feed pro∣miscuously upon either Fish or Flesh; they eat Beef, Mutton, Goat and Deer, and the Flesh of Camels is admir'd by them, and is in repute for a Healthful sort of Meat. But they are very nice and curious in killing those Animals on which they feed, and which they refuse to taste 'till the Meat is cleans'd and washt from the Blood. They abound too in many sorts of Fish, and are scru∣pulous in Eating of some kinds of them, such especially as have no Scales, from
<PB N="427" REF="226"/>
which they totally refrain, and esteem the Food of such as well as of Blood, an Abomination. The Soil affords abun∣dance of Wheat, which might be proper∣ly made use of for their Bread, but the Dates are so plentiful, so pleasant and admir'd, that they mix them with all their Food, and eat them instead of Bread, through all these parts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> both with their Fish and Flesh.</P>
<P>But of all the Followers of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and zealous Admirers of his four princi∣pal Doctors, <HI>Abu Becre, Osman, Omar</HI> and <HI>Hali,</HI> none are so rigidly Abstemi∣ous as the <HI>Arabians</HI> of <HI>Muscatt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Abstinence of the Na∣tives.</NOTE> as well from the Juice of the Grape, as other more common and innocent Liquors. For Tea and Coffee which are judg'd the privileg'd Liquors of all the <HI>Maho∣metans,</HI> as well <HI>Turks,</HI> as those of <HI>Persia, India,</HI> and other parts of <HI>A∣rabia,</HI> are condemn'd by them as unlaw∣ful Refreshments, and abominated as Bug-bear Liquors, as well as Wine. He that would turn Advocate for any of these sorts of Drink, and commend the Use of them as convenient for their Stomachs, as fit to chear their Hearts, and chase away Melancholy from their
<PB N="428" REF="227"/>
Spirits, would be look'd upon as a vile Contemner of their Law, and an Encou∣rager of Libertinism and Intemperance. They abhor likewise the smoaking of Tobacco, and the warm intoxicating Fumes of that <HI>Indian</HI> Weed, and con∣stantly burn all that they can find brought into their Country. Sugar, Water, and Orange mixt together, which they call Sherbet, is their on∣ly Drink; such is their Antipathy to all Liquors that are warm and strong, that in perfect Indignation they rased a <HI>Jews</HI> House to the ground, that had only made some strong Waters. There∣fore they call themselves the strict <HI>Arabs,</HI> the Chaste <HI>Mahometans,</HI> the only true Professors of the <HI>Mussulman</HI>-Law, and genuine followers of the Prophet. To this degree of Abstinence they are all bred up, who are Natives of this Region hereabouts; thus they abstain from all those sensible gratifications of their Palates, which may any way ine∣briate their Faculties, and render the Mind dull and unactive; and shun the Taste of any thing that may disturb their Person, or raise up in them any irregular Appetites.</P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="227"/>Nor is the Justice and Civil Conver∣sation of the <HI>Arabians</HI> at <HI>Muscatt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ex∣traordina∣ry Justice and Civili∣ty.</NOTE> less remarkable and to be admir'd, than their extreme Temperance and Sobrie∣ty. The Governour of the City, who is nearly related to the King of the Country, takes care that a strict Watch be kept in the Castle every Night, for the safety of the City, and prevention of all Disorders that might happen. And will not allow any Boat to go, or come ashore, or to row from Ship to Ship, either before the Sun rises, or after it is down; to the end that all that Traffick may do their Business while it is Day, that no man might dispose of his Goods secretly, and shel∣ter himself by the obscurity of the Night.</P>
<P>They forbid all Despotick Authori∣ty in private Families,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No private Correction in Fami∣lies.</NOTE> and the Arbi∣trary proceedings of either Masters or Parents towards their Domesticks. So that if either a Child or a Servant chance to transgress, let the Crime be what it will, either more heinous, or less vil∣lanous, Publick Justice must determine the Punishment, and the Magistrates must interpose in awarding the Penalty,
<PB N="430" REF="228"/>
and no man must lift up his Hand to punish any that offends in his own Fa∣mily. By this Oeconomy in their Af∣fairs, the Inferiours are freed from the violence of all Splenitick Disgusts, and unreasonable Severities of their Superi∣ours. A Revengeful Master cannot vent his Passion at his Pleasure upon his Ser∣vant, nor an unnatural Parent Beat and Chastise his Son at his will: Complaint must first be made to the Magistrates of the place, who being dispassionate and unprejudic'd in their Tempers, examin the matter with a still Mind, and Arbi∣trate calmly in the Case. No private Punishment is ever inflicted in <HI>Muscatt</HI> and the adjacent parts; they cannot there think that any Corrections are so equitable, as those that proceed from the deliberate Sentence of unbyassed Men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of punishing Malefa∣ctors.</NOTE>If Murther or Theft, or any such execrable Crime is at any time com∣mitted among them; which are seldom∣er here than in any other part of the World, the Malefactor is never Punish∣ed with sudden Death, nor does any fatal hand touch him, but his Sentence is, to be Immur'd, where he leasurely
<PB N="431" REF="228"/>
dies, between two Walls. For they hate by any violent direct Death, to take away the life of any Offender.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Justice speedily ad∣ministred.</NOTE></P>
<P>They are never dilatory in their Ad∣ministrations of Justice, nor vex the Clients with tiresome Delays, but quick∣ly determin in the Case, and dispatch all matters that are brought before them. The Governour with fifty or sixty more sit openly to the publick view, whene∣ver they do justice, which is not by plu∣rality of Voices, but all unanimously consent to the Sentence that is pro∣nounced.</P>
<P>These <HI>Arabians</HI> are very courteous in their Deportment, and extreme Civil to all Strangers; they offer neither Violence nor Affront to any; and tho' they are very tenacious of their own Principles, and Admirers of their own Religion, yet do they never impose it upon any, nor are their Morals leven'd with such furious Zeal, as to divest them of Hu∣manity, and a tender Respect.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The extra∣ordinary ho∣nesty of the <HI>Arabians.</HI></NOTE> A Man may travel hundreds of Miles in this Country, and never meet with any a∣busive Language, or any Behaviour that looks Rude. And if you happen to be loaded with any Money in your

Travels, you need no Arms to defend your Person, nor any Guards to secure your Purse; for you may sleep with it in your Hands in the open Fields, or lay it by you with safety as you repose your self in the King's High-way. Cap∣tain <HI>Edward Say,</HI> who had liv'd among them at <HI>Muscatt</HI> for several Years, and who affirm'd all this Relation to be really true, had passed from one part of the Country to another, some hun∣dreds of Miles, and never was troubled by any Person, tho' he slept sometimes in the Roads and Fields, neither heard he of any that had been pillag'd by Robbers all that while.</P>
<P>In fine, these are a People natural∣ly Temperate and Just, and endued with those excellent Qualities which the <HI>Grecian</HI> Philosophers and <HI>Roman</HI> Mora∣lists endeavour'd to inspire into their Subjects, tho' they miss'd of their aim. For these are directly opposite in their Temper and manner of Life to those wild <HI>Arabs,</HI> that haunt the Banks of <HI>Tigris,</HI> and sculk about near the River of <HI>Euphrates,</HI> that live by Rapine, spoil and violence. I shall relate only one remarkable Passage more, concerning
<PB N="433" REF="229"/>
the Justice and Kindness of these <HI>Arabs,</HI> and leave this Theme.</P>
<P>When the forementioned Captain <HI>Say</HI> had unluckily lost his Ship on the Island of <HI>Macira,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Arabi∣ans</HI> great kindness to Captain <HI>Say,</HI> after his Ship∣wrack.</NOTE> which is near this Coast of <HI>Arabia;</HI> he and his Mariners were so fortunate that they sav'd all their Lives, and got on Shoar, tho' naked and in a very distress'd forlorn Condition. The sight of this deplorable Accident mov'd the <HI>Arabs</HI> to Pity and Compassi∣on towards them, and made them offer their Service, by such Signs, as they thought might be most Intelligible, for assisting them in the Recovery of those Goods that were on board the WracK. They were perfect strangers both of them to each others Persons and Language, and therefore one among the rest, who lookt like the Governour, rais'd a heap of Sand, as they sat near one another, upon the Shoar, which he divided into three parts, reserving two to himself, and offering the other to the Captain. But the Captain esteeming it unequally proportion'd, shook his Head, in token that he dislik'd the Bargain. The Governour seeing this, adjusted the matter with more equality,
<PB N="434" REF="230"/>
and divided the Heap of Sand into two parts only, one of which he took to himself, and gave the other half to the Captain; which because he thought it very fair, they shook Hands upon it, as a sign they were both well content∣ed. The Money which was brought on Shoar, and saved from the Wrack, was twelve or fourteen Thousand Pounds, which they contriv'd to divide in this manner. They tyed to a Stick two Baskets instead of a pair of Scales, and made them as equipoize as they could, and by these they weighed each parcel that was brought off from the Ship with great exactness; if there ap∣pear'd any seeming advantage in either Ballance, the Governour forc'd that al∣ways upon the Captain, so that he was not injur'd one Mite, nor in all that Ac∣count lost a Farthing that was his Due. If the Inhabitants upon all the Coasts of <HI>Europe</HI> were as Hospitable and Just to all Persons of their own Perswasion, as these <HI>Arabians</HI> were to those of a strange Faith, and distant Nation, those that do narrowly escape with their Lives from the Dangers of the Sea, would not so often by a merciless People be
<PB N="435" REF="230"/>
so barbarously depriv'd of them at Land. The King too in Compassion to his Mi∣series, requir'd only 2 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for his Goods, whilst he made other Strangers pay 4.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> formerly were re∣ceiv'd by the <HI>Arabians</HI> at <HI>Muscatt,</HI> with abundance of Civility and Candor, and allow'd not only the freedom and Ex∣ercise of their Religion, but encourag'd to build a stately Church, and erect a College, and were no way stinted in the Profession of their Faith, and ostenta∣tion of their Pompous Worship.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reason of the War of the <HI>Ara∣bians</HI> with the <HI>Portu∣guese.</HI></NOTE> The King granted them the freedom of the Port, by which they grew very Pow∣erful and Wealthy, and by that means Indulg'd themselves in Ease and Luxu∣ry, built many fair Houses in the Ci∣ty to dwell in, and at length began to be so Insolent and Unruly, that they openly abus'd that Civility which had entertain'd them so friendly, despis'd that Government by which they had been Protected, and endeavour'd to wrest the Authority out of the Hands of the Civil Magistrate, and set up their own instead of it. The <HI>Arabs</HI> who are naturally Civil and obliging, bore the
<PB N="436" REF="231"/>
repeated Insolencies with great Patience, and were loath to be drawn into any Quarrels or Debates with them, not∣withstanding all this turbulent Carri∣age of the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> 'till allarm'd with the danger of their City, and un∣able to endure their Affronts any lon∣ger, the King himself appear'd in Per∣son with a numerous Army of reso∣lute <HI>Arabs,</HI> with whom he set down before the City. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> de∣fended themselves against him with great Courage for a long time, and shut them∣selves up in their Church and College, which were converted into Cittadels for their Safeguard, because they were strong. But the <HI>Arabs</HI> at length block∣ing up all the Avenues whereby they might expect any Succour either by Sea or Land, and placing themselves upon heights which overlook'd the Fortifi∣cations of the Enemy, who receiv'd no Relief either from <HI>Goa</HI> or <HI>Cong,</HI> as they expected; the <HI>Portuguese</HI> at length be∣took themselves privately to two or three of their Ships which lay in the Harbour, and made their Escape that way. The Holes of the Gun-shot which the <HI>Arabs</HI> made in the Church and College of the
<PB N="437" REF="231"/>
<HI>Portuguese,</HI> during the time or the Siege, are yet visible. Since this Re∣bellion, there arose an invincible Hatred between these two Nations, that were thus at variance; so that they are al∣ways designing upon each others Lives and Estates where-ever they meet. The <HI>Arabians</HI> are a Stout, Couragious, Hardy Nation, and will in nothing, give place to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and gene∣rally are Victorious, and prevail against them as often as they Attack each other at Sea. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> are mightily sunk, as well in their Courage, as in their Fame and Fortune, and are found to be such contemptible Enemies, that they are seldom discours'd of, but with Reproach, by the name of <HI>Gallina's, i. e.</HI> Hen-hearted Fellows. The <HI>Arabs</HI> car∣ry in some of their Ships above 500 Men, go out in Fleets, and are so very strong in their Naval Forces, that the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> generally endeavour to avoid them, and never dispute it with them but with great Advantage on their side.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Arabs</HI> kindness to their Ene∣mies.</NOTE> All the Prisoners of War are made Slaves of on both sides; and those that are taken by the Inhabitants of <HI>Muscatt,</HI> are used so very kindly, that they are tempted al∣most
<PB N="438" REF="232"/>
to be in love with their Confine∣ment, and are never us'd with any such Hardships, so as to be forct to attempt an Escape by Flight. They neither cor∣rect them like Slaves, nor impose upon them any servile work, but maintain them in Ease and Idleness, with a cer∣tain allowance of Provisions every day. Of such inconquerable Generosity are these <HI>Arabians</HI> even to their very Ene∣mies! And tho' they sometimes per∣swade them to their own Faith, and to turn <HI>Mahometans,</HI> 'tis never but with Mildness, with gentle Allurements, and Hopes of Reward.</P>
<P>I will here insert a short Account of the taking of Captain <HI>Edward Say</HI> by the <HI>Sanganians,</HI> who Inhabit a Country op∣posite to the <HI>Arabian</HI> Shoar, and then pass over to the other Coast of <HI>Arabia</HI> the <HI>Happy,</HI> which borders upon the <HI>Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain <HI>Says</HI> Cap∣tivity by Pyrates.</NOTE>This Commander, after his Ship∣wrack upon the Island <HI>Macira,</HI> and a te∣dious stay among the <HI>Arabians</HI> at <HI>Mus∣catt,</HI> set Sail from thence to the Island of <HI>Bombay</HI> in the Company of eighteen or twenty Ships bound for <HI>Suratt,</HI> and other parts of <HI>India.</HI> After they had
<PB N="439" REF="232"/>
been some time at Sea they parted Com∣pany, and the Ship wherein the Cap∣tain had imbarked, espyed a little after, two Sail to windward of them, as far as they could see from the top-Mast-Head, which made all the Sail they could after them, and thereby forc'd them to bear away right before the Wind with all the Sail they had; and to lighten their Ship so as that she might the better es∣cape them, they cut away their Boat which was tow'd a stern, and threw a∣bundance of valuable Goods over-board. But the two Ships notwithstanding this, outsaild them, and as they came up to∣wards them, the Black Sea-men descri∣ed them by their Colours, to be <HI>San∣ganians.</HI> They gave the Captain Chase all the Day long 'till four a Clock in the Afternoon, who fir'd the Stern-Chase with his four Guns all the while; at length they shot his Man at the Helm thro' the Head, and laid him on board in the Midships, entring 70 or 80 Men with Sword and Target. The Black Sail∣ers, who were thirty, leapt over-board to save their Lives, leaving the Ship to the Captain and his two Servants. The Throat of one of them was imme∣diately
<PB N="440" REF="233"/>
cut, and as they came in fury to hew down the Captain, and slay him instantly, as they had done his Servant, he fended off the fatal Blow by receiv∣ing it on his Hand, which was cut half off thro' the dint and violence of the Stroke. While they were thus eager for his Destruction, and intent in ta∣king away his Life, they espyed a Rich Prize which diverted their Fury and Design; for the Captain wore a sett of Gold Buttons upon his Coat, which they presently flew at upon the first sight, and were so zealous for the Pur∣chase, that he ransom'd his Life by the price of his Gold. They stript him as naked as an <HI>Indian Faquir,</HI> excepting only a small piece of a shirt to cover his Nakedness, and left him in that San∣tone-like Condition for two Months, without either Hat to his Head, or Shoe to his Foot. One of the <HI>Sanganian</HI> Ships which had made them a Prize, was of some Force, she carried ten Guns and 150 Men; the other was only a small Galley of no more than four Guns and 50 Men, whereby the Captain who had resisted them stoutly for some time, be∣ing easily overpower'd, was forc'd to
<PB N="441" REF="233"/>
surrender. The <HI>Sanganians</HI> after the Dispute wat over, finding no more re∣sistance, grew compassionate and kind, and refresht the Captain with Water and Opium,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Opium a refresh∣ment.</NOTE> which was the Nourishment they found most proper for themselves after any hard Labour or Languishment of Spirit, and the speediest Relief for decayed Nature. They were much con∣cern'd too for the Cure of his Hand, which was in danger of being lost by the deepness of the Wound, and ap∣ply'd to it Loaf Sugar to stop the Bleed∣ing, and something else to keep the Wound clean; after which the Wool of a Sheep's Back, and the Oil of their Lamps, without any other Medicines, in a short time thoroughly perfected the Cure.</P>
<P>The Ship was taken near the Island of <HI>Bombay,</HI> which made them spend a Month in Sailing before they Arriv'd in their own Country. When they drew near <HI>Aramra,</HI> which was the Port to which they design'd, they according to Custom, fir'd a Gun belonging to the Captain's Ship, to salute their Country and Relations; in which the Captain had hid 1500 Venetians, to secure them
<PB N="442" REF="234"/>
from the Rapine of the <HI>Pyrates,</HI> think∣ing them safe in that strong Hold, but were by this means unluckily lost; which made it a very costly Salute to our poor Commander, of whose Mo∣ney they discharg'd near 700 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> at one Shot.</P>
<P>The Queen of the Country, after she heard of their Arrival, sent a Messenger for the Captain to bring him up to Court, whither he travell'd for two or three Miles without Covering either to his Head or Feet, very ill equipt to ap∣pear in the Presence of a Queen. When he came in this distress before her Ma∣jesty, she spoke to him by a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Interpreter, who inquir'd of him by the Queen's directions, which of her People they were that had his Moneys; which he answer'd he could not tell. Then she threatned to keep him a perpetu∣al Exile from his Country, and for his further Comfort, would allow him on∣ly Salt Water to drink.</P>
<P>It happen'd about a Month before this time, that a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ship with a Priest and his Images had been ta∣ken and brought into this Harbour, which because they were devoutly Re∣ver'd
<PB N="443" REF="234"/>
by that Nation, therefore did the Queen imagin, that all <HI>Europeans</HI> had them in the same Religious Esteem: And because that the Captain was in∣flexible to her other Menaces, she or∣der'd the Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> with those of two or three Saints more, about a Foot high, to be brought be∣fore him, and told him if he would but yield to kiss them, she would give cre∣dit to what he said. The Captain who was a very Rational Man, and bred out of the Road of Romish Superstition, was neither so sparing of his Civilities, as to forbear a Complement to the piece of Wood, nor of such unrefin'd Prin∣ciples as to give it a Religious Adorati∣on, but was ready either to kiss or burn it, which they pleas'd, since he had an assurance of his Release upon such ea∣sie terms, and therefore kiss'd it very freely; and after two or three days stay here, where he fed upon Rice and Wa∣ter, and lay in the Night time with the Cattle, he was dismiss'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cap∣tains re∣lease.</NOTE> A while af∣ter they sent him aboard his Vessel for a day or two, which lay in the Harbour, and gave him along with him about twelve Pints of Wheat, the
<PB N="444" REF="235"/>
Sweepings of the Ship, to sustain him in his Voyage to <HI>Suratt;</HI> but he im∣bark'd upon an <HI>Arabian</HI> Ship which was then loading for <HI>Muscatt,</HI> in which he was carried to that City.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aramra.</NOTE><HI>Aramra,</HI> where the Captain was brought in Prisoner, lies opposite to the <HI>Arabian</HI> Shoar, between <HI>Sindy</HI> and <HI>Cape Jugatt,</HI> a little distance from <HI>Diu,</HI> which belongs to the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> The Coun∣try of these <HI>Sanganians</HI> lies between those vast Empires of <HI>Persia,</HI> which is on the <HI>West,</HI> and <HI>Indiston,</HI> which bor∣ders upon it on the <HI>East.</HI> They are great <HI>Pyrates,</HI> and live by those Prizes which they take at Sea, where they range from the Streights of <HI>Ormus</HI> to the Gulf of <HI>Cambay,</HI> and down the <HI>Ma∣labar</HI> Coast, Cruising about from one place to another, where any hopes of Booty invites them forward. They infest all the Western Coasts of <HI>India,</HI> and tho' their Ships are of no great Force, yet they are seldom taken be∣cause they are made so well for Sail, that they are ready to run when they see a Vessel of any Countenance; and those they think they are able to Encounter, they endeavour to make of them a Prey.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="235"/>Tho' the Principles of these <HI>Saga∣nians</HI> are so far leven'd with Fraud and Injustice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An instance of Justice in these <HI>Sanganian</HI> Pyrates.</NOTE> that they wholly devote themselves to a life of Piracy, and sub∣sist by the Spoil of the Innocent Traf∣fickers at Sea, yet have they not all di∣vested themselves of their obligations to all kinds of Justice, but are very faith∣ful to what they promise, and invio∣lable observers of their Word; as our Captain had occasion to try by an Ex∣periment very successful and advanta∣tagious. For being robb'd of all his Wealth, but an hundred Checkins which were privately hid in some part of the Ship, his Cook came to him and acquainted him, that the Boat∣swain of the Man of War, who was put in Commander in chief on Board them, would ingage to return him half of whatever Money was committed to his Custody. The Captain deliver'd to him an hundred pieces of Gold, which the Boatswain tied in a small bit of Cloath, with a small Line to it and a Bouy at the end of it, and threw it over-board. For every Man was searched before they went ashoar, and not suffer'd to come from aboard, 'till
<PB N="446" REF="236"/>
the Vessel was unladed. The day fol∣lowing, the Boatswain went over-board in quest of the Bag he had dropt in the Ocean, and after a little search found it, and deliver'd half of the Gold to the Captain; at which the Captain was so well pleas'd, being wholly at his Mercy, and in that distress, that he offer'd him ten pieces as a gratuity, which the Boatswain rejected for this Reason, because he told him he would keep his word according to his Pro∣mise.</P>

<PB N="448" REF="237"/>
of these places, or run out in expatiat∣ing upon their Government and Laws, the Manners and Customs of their In∣habitants, or their Strength and Polity, but only lead him along the Shoar, and give him a view of the Harbours as we Coast along, to prevent all Miscarriage at his first entring into these Ports, ma∣ny of which are scarce known to the Navigators of <HI>Europe.</HI> A fuller Ac∣count of these Parts may be expected from another Hand; from Mr. <HI>Edward Clyve,</HI> who by his Personal Observati∣ons is qualified not only for confirming all this Relation, but also is furnish'd with such Remarks, as inable him for a larger performance, in a clear and am∣ple Account of what is yet unknown, and very worthy the publick Notice, among these People.</P>
<P>I shall observe no other Method in this Relation, than what Nature has chalkt out to us in the Situation of the Towns, which shall briefly be describ'd according as they lie upon the Sea-Coast.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why called the Red Sea.</NOTE>And shall begin with the <HI>Arabian Gulph,</HI> or <HI>Red Sea,</HI> the reason of which Name is perplext with variety of O∣pinions
<PB N="449" REF="237"/>
and different Conjectures; for Antiquity (we find) did not confine the Name of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> only to that nar∣now Channel which divides <HI>Arabia</HI> from <HI>Africk,</HI> and gives a boundary to some parts of those Ancient Kingdoms, but included also the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulf, and all the Seas about <HI>Arabia,</HI> and all that vast Tract of Ocean which extends from <HI>Capè bone Esperance,</HI> even beyond the River <HI>Ganges:</HI> And the later Western Writers have limited it only to this Gulph, because it lies the nearest, and was first discover'd to them. There∣fore they contend, that because King <HI>E∣rythros,</HI> who was Master of this Sea, was interr'd in one of its Islands, it ob∣tain'd the Name of <HI>Mare Erithraeum,</HI> which signifies the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Latines</HI> and others from thence, have re∣tain'd the same Appellation. Some fan∣cy that the redness of the Sand or Co∣rall, which lie at the Bottom, or the redness of its Waters; and others affirm that the strong reflexion of the Sun's Beams upon the Surface, or the redness of the Neighbouring Hills, might just∣ly occasion the immposition of this Name. <HI>Herodotus</HI> takes notice of a
<PB N="450" REF="238"/>

<P>I should now take leave of this place, and proceed to give some account of <HI>Mocha,</HI> were it not convenient, before my departure, to insist a little upon the Discovery of some Ports and Passages hereabouts, to instruct such as design to Travel into these Seas.</P>
<P>The Land of <HI>Aden,</HI> because it makes like an Island, was formerly reputed to have been one; from whence steer∣ing <HI>W.</HI> and <HI>W.</HI> by <HI>N.</HI> you will come to the <HI>Babbs,</HI> which in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Lan∣guage, signifies Gate or Door.

But the great Ships for better Se∣curity, chuse rather to go on the outside, where is seldom less than Forty Fathom, 'till they hale in for Shore, which is commonly done, as soon as they are past the <HI>Streights.</HI> Here are seven Islands, but none of them so remarkable as the <HI>Babbs.</HI> The <HI>Streights</HI> here are common∣ly called those of <HI>Babel Mandel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Babell-Mandell.</NOTE> which are about 7 Leagues over from main Land to main Land, about 20 Leagues from <HI>Aden,</HI> and 12 or 13 from <HI>Mocha.</HI> The Course from the <HI>Babbs</HI> is about <HI>N.</HI> by <HI>West,</HI> and <HI>N.

<P>Before you come to these <HI>Streights,</HI> you will make a very high Table Land, and an opening to the Southward of it; which appears very like the passage in∣to the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> but then you will dis∣cover the said <HI>Babbs</HI> Island to rectifie you, thro' which steering <HI>North,</HI> or <HI>N.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> as you see occasion; there is opening to the Southward of the said high Land, a great River that leads to <HI>Gella,</HI> which is the greatest Port on the <HI>Abasseen</HI> side without the said <HI>Babbs.</HI></P>

the Arrival at <HI>Mocha,</HI> is a seeming Wood, which is several Date-Trees and Gar∣dens, to the Northward of which is <HI>Mocha,</HI> which yields a more beautiful prospect at Sea, than on Shore.

When the Southermost Mosque is once brought to bear, <HI>E.</HI> by <HI>S.</HI> the Ships may luff up, or bear into the Road, and Anchor in 4, 5, 6, or 7 Fathom.

Tho' the <HI>Mogul</HI> cannot justly charge the <HI>E.

<P>The Neighbourhood of <HI>Cape Bone E∣speranse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rea∣son of the coolness of the Air at the <HI>Cape.</HI></NOTE> to that vast Ocean towards the <HI>South,</HI> cools the Air to some Degrees beyond what the proportion of that La∣titude might otherwise seem to give. For in the same Degree <HI>North,</HI> as Mariners observe, particularly where there is not the Extent of so wide an Ocean, the cool∣ness of the Air is not so perceptible. The reason of it may be the spacious spread∣ing Tract of Sea, which gives the Air once agitated, more liberty to continue its motion, and constantly to increase its Coldness; which on the contrary, is straitn'd and repress'd on Land, by the meeting of Mountains, Trees, Houses, and other Obstacles, and therefore not so impetuous; neither so Cold, because the Sulphureous Vapours which arise from the Earth, and make fiery Exhala∣tions, often intermixing with the Ni∣trous, which make Wind, qualify them
<PB N="486" REF="256"/>
in some measure. As at <HI>Suratt,</HI> the Winds are by much Hotter, which fly over the Land to us, than those that come from the Sea. The <HI>South</HI> Winds here there∣fore are observ'd to be the coolest, be∣cause they blow from the great Sea.

And all those sorts of Grain which are proper for Food, or for making strong Drink, thrive here, and grow in that plenty, that no part of <HI>Europe</HI> can a∣bound with them more. Which is all to be ascrib'd to the indefatigable Dili∣gence and Industry of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who being forc'd to a good Husbandry of the Ground by the scantiness which they live upon at home, continue their thrifty Cultivating humour, when they are remov'd to a Soil where they may Cultivate what quantity they please; for they are a People remarkable for Improvements, for their commendable Pains and Care where ever they In∣habit.</P>

to their Nature and Customs. They retain the vulgar name of <HI>Ho∣tantots,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason of their Name.</NOTE> because of their constant repe∣tition of that word in their hobling Dances.</P>
<P>There is a vast difference between the nature of these People that dwell upon this place, and the Country they Inhabit; for of all parts this affords a Dwelling most neat and pleasant, and of all People they are the most Besti∣al and sordid. They are the very Re∣verse of Human kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bestial nature of the <HI>Ho∣tantots.</HI></NOTE> Cousin Germans to the <HI>Halalchors,</HI> only meaner and more filthy; so that if there's any medium between a Rational Animal and a Beast, the <HI>Hotontot</HI> lays the fairest Claim to that Species. They are sunk even below Idolatry, are destitute both of Priest and Temple, and saving a little show of rejoicing, which is made at the Full and the New Moon; have lost all kind of Religious Devotion. Nature has so richly provided for their convenience in this Life, that they have drown'd all sense of the God of it, and are grown quite careless of the next.</P>
<P>They are more Tawny than the <HI>In∣dians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their out∣ward form.</NOTE> and in Colour and Features come
<PB N="490" REF="258"/>
nearest the <HI>Negroes</HI> of any People, only they are not quite so Black, nor is their Cottony Hair so Crisp, nor their No∣ses altogether so flat. For Nature pleases her self as well in the variety of Indivi∣duals of the same kind, as in a great num∣ber of Species of all sorts of Animals.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Discourse concerning the <HI>Ne∣groes</HI> blackness.</NOTE>It might seem here a rational Conje∣cture for the reason of the <HI>Negroes</HI> Black∣ness, that they are burnt by the Sun's Beams, which we experimentally find tinctures the fairest Complexions, when it comes near them, which recover a∣gain by withdrawing to a cooler Air. And therefore that those who are most expos'd to the Sun's Heat should al∣ways be the Blackest. For Blackness and Whiteness are not suppos'd natural to any People whatever, 'tis presum'd to be the effect of the Climate, because those that are Fair by living a long time under or near the Line, shall in two or three Generations, as 'tis af∣firm'd, become tawny and Black, tho' they Marry only with fair People. But methinks there is something in Nature which seems to thwart this current O∣pinion. For under the same Parallels are People of quite different Colours; as for instance, the <HI>Hotantots,</HI> who live
<PB N="491" REF="258"/>
between thirty four and thirty five De∣grees are Black; the Inhabitants of <HI>Can∣die,</HI> who are under the same Elevation of the Pole, are White. The People of <HI>England</HI> are white, and the Natives near <HI>Hudson</HI>'s <HI>Bay,</HI> which is as Cold and <HI>Northerly</HI> a Climate, are Black. And neither the Colony of the <HI>English</HI> near <HI>Hudson</HI>'s <HI>Bay,</HI> nor the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Cape Bone Esperanse</HI> receive any altera∣tion in their Colour, but are fresh and fair as in <HI>Europe,</HI> and yet the Natives in both parts are Olive-colour'd. Some are apt to ascribe this to the Air and Climate or Earth, which in some pla∣ces produces Patagons, who are Giants, as in other, Pygmies; but this seems weak and unaccountable. Others re∣solve much of it into the effect of Food and Diet, which I believe may be of some power, and efficacy in this mat∣ter upon this Account. Because at <HI>Suratt,</HI> I observ'd a young <HI>Indian</HI> very Black, taken into the <HI>English</HI> Service, who by tasting Wine and Eating Flesh, grew paler sensibly than he was before. The strong Aliment by a frequent mix∣ture of its lively Juyces with the Blood and Spirits, which for a long time had been kept low by a Phlegmatick Nou∣rishment,
<PB N="492" REF="259"/>
did actuate and purify them by degrees, and thereby shew'd in some∣time the effect of their fermentation by a faint Varnish upon the Face. Be∣sides, it is a Remark of the Ancients, but not methinks very sound, whereby they took notice, that 'tis the Humidity of the Elements, which defends the <HI>Indians</HI> against that Action of the Sun, which burns the Complexion of the <HI>Negroes;</HI> and makes their Hair grow like Cotton; whereas some of the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> whose Hair is long and uncurled, live as near the <HI>Aequator,</HI> and endure as intense a Heat as the <HI>Hotantots</HI> and several Negroes of <HI>Africa,</HI> whose Hair is crisp and frizl'd. And therefore something must be added besides the Sun's Heat, for distinction of Com∣plexion and of Hair under the same Pa∣rallels. <HI>Lewenhoock</HI> observes that the Blood of the <HI>Negroes</HI> is of a different Contexture from ours. And <HI>Malpighi</HI> observ'd a small Membrane not transpa∣rent between the <HI>Cutis</HI> and <HI>Cuticula,</HI> which caus'd the Blackness.</P>

they are far from being Curious either in their Food or Attire, any further than what they find Nature reaches forth to them. They think it a need∣less Toil to spend time in dressing of the Hides of Bulls, or in Spinning and Weaving the Wool of Sheep, for Ornaments and Covering to their Bo∣dies. They are satisfied with the same wrought Garments that Nature has clad the Sheep with, and therefore without more Labour or Art, they take them from the Backs of the Sheep, and put them presently upon their own, and so they walk with that Sheep-Skin Mantle about their Shoulders, or some∣times thrown like a Hood over their Heads, which seem to be the Ancientest Garments, according to <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.21. <HI>un∣to</HI> Adam <HI>and his Wife did the Lord make Coats of Skins.</HI> They generally turn the Wool inwards, that the outside of the Garment may defend them from Rain, and the inside from the impres∣sions of Cold. The Ornaments about their Heads are small Shells, or little pieces of Lead or Iron fasten'd to their friz'ld Hair, or put into their Ears. The Hair of their Heads, and of all their
<PB N="494" REF="260"/>
Bodies are besmear'd with Kitchin-Grease, tho' never so stinking and Loathsome, which when dissolv'd and heated by their Bodies, sends from thence such an unsavoury Smell, as may be scented at a Furlongs distance, and nearer hand it never fails of a strong Emetick to a weak Stomach. Stinking Grease is their sweet Oil, and the Dust of the Streets the Powder of their Hair. They Anoint their Bodies to render their Nerves supple and active, and to fortifie the Pores against the Violence of the ambient Air. For they are both nimble and swift of Foot, and of Cou∣rage to outface and worst a Lion. Be∣fore their Nakedness hangs a small Skin about a foot broad, tied by a string about their middle, which the motion of their Bodies, or of the Air, sometimes turns aside.</P>
<P>The Apparel of the Women upon the upper part of the Body is the same with the Men's; but round their Legs are twisted Sheeps Guts two or three Inches thick, which are serviceable upon a double account, both for Food and Ornament. The Guts, which are
<PB N="495" REF="260"/>
made more savoury by the Dirt which sticks to them, affords them as good a Meal as the Flesh of the Sheep, and are eaten with as good a Gusto.</P>
<P>The Huts they dwell in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Huts which they dwell in.</NOTE> which are made of Bul-Rushes, or Branches of Trees, are fashion'd round almost like a Bee-hive, reaching about five Foot high, and nine broad, with a small Passage in the side to creep in at, and a Hole in the middle for the Fire.</P>
<P>They disallow Polygamy in all, but in their Chief, who may entertain three Wives at once. And the kind Wives, after the Death of every Husband,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wives penance for a dead Husband.</NOTE> if they Marry again, cut off a Joint from the little Finger, and proceed to the middle, if they Bury many. The same is imitated by some fond Indulgent Husbands, but on neither of them is there any incumbent necessity, only as they are led by Humour at those times.</P>
<P>The Male Children at Eight or Ten Years of Age, are Cut in their Privy Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castra∣tion of the Males.</NOTE> and depriv'd of one of their Testicles. The same is likewise done at <HI>Cape Comoron,</HI> for increasing their Valour and Activity. But here, I be∣lieve

upon another Score, <HI>viz.</HI> For prevention of a too Luxuriant In∣crease by Generation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason of it.</NOTE> because when their Children Increase beyond their Desires, and the just number which they design, to prevent a heavier Charge upon the Parents, they dispatch the Supernumeraries to the other World, without any Remorse for the horrid Crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mur∣der of their Chil∣dren.</NOTE> or Consciousness of the ex∣ecrable Sin of Murther, which is the Reason, I presume, of the <HI>Hotantot</HI>'s losing part of their Virility, that they may debilitate that Native Heat, which powerfully prompts them to Propaga∣tion. This Barbarity has prevail'd a∣mongst a much politer People than the <HI>Hotantots,</HI> even the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who hold a Transmigration, and alledge this Rea∣son for killing their Children, when they abound with them, which is, to make them spring up the more Happy. When the King of <HI>Sciam</HI> too has any Design upon the Honour or Estate of a <HI>Mandarin</HI> or Great Commander, he cau∣ses him to undergo a total Castration, that their Titles and Riches, for want of Issue, may fall into his Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="261"/>There is a vulgar Opinion which has formerly been receiv'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Hotan∣tots</HI> no Hermo∣phradites.</NOTE> that the Na∣tives of this <HI>Cape</HI> were <HI>Hermophradites,</HI> which was founded only upon Con∣jecture; for two Gentlemen, who were resolv'd not to be liable to this Er∣rour, assur'd me the Report was false, upon the Curiosity they had of know∣ing the Reason of it, which was be∣cause the Female Parts were cut in the Fashion of small Teats hanging down.</P>
<P>Those that can be induc'd to labour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Lazi∣ness.</NOTE> and undergo any Toil among the <HI>Ho∣tantots,</HI> are made Slaves of by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and imploy'd in all servile Drudgeries. But their Native Inclina∣tion to Idleness and a careless Life, will scarce admit of either Force or Re∣wards for reclaiming them from that innate Lethargick humour.</P>
<P>Their common Answer to all Mo∣tives of this kind, is, that the Fields and Woods afford plenty of Necessaries for their Support, and Nature has Am∣ply provided for their Subsistence, by loading the Trees with plenty of Al∣monds, which grow in the Forests, and yield them Food; and by disper∣sing up and down many wholsome

Brooks and pure Rivolets to quench their Thirst: So that there is no need of Work, when such innocent Diet offers it self daily without Pains, and on which they can live without Care. And thus many of them idly spend the Years of a useless restive Life. But the Governour of the Fort, and seve∣ral <HI>Dutch</HI> Inhabitants of the Town pre∣vail upon some of them, and make Con∣verts of them to labour and hardships. Thus the <HI>Hotantots</HI> have degenerated into the strangest kind of Rationals, and have successively surviv'd the No∣ble and common Instincts of Humani∣ty; but in their Innocence of Life, the Customs of the Ancient <HI>Britains</HI> did in many things resemble the Inhabitants of this Promontory, in their drinking Water, and the simplicity of their Food, which was upon Acorns or Ber∣ries, or such natural Productions; some∣times upon Milk, or what they could gain by Hunting. A great part of their Bodies too was uncover'd, espe∣cially their Arms and Legs, and their Cloathing was the same with that of the <HI>Hotantots,</HI> made generally of the Skins of Beasts.</P>
<P><PB N="499" REF="262"/>The <HI>Third</HI> thing observable at the <HI>Cape,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ad∣vantage which the <HI>Dutch</HI> reap by this <HI>Cape.</HI></NOTE> was the Profit and Advantage which that Plantation affords the <HI>Dutch.</HI> As this Climate is most de∣lightful, and the Native Turf capable of producing any thing that may ad∣minister either to the Exigence or De∣light of Man; so is it suited with the greatest convenience imaginable to the important Negotiations of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> whose Ships that Design for <HI>India,</HI> and those that return from thence to <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> are refresht here with all Con∣veniencies, as in the mid-way between those two distant Regions.</P>
<P>The Industry of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> has inlarg'd their Borders so far upon the main Land of this Delightful Fertile <HI>Cape,</HI> that were they ever put to those straits as to be forc'd to Decamp, and leave their Native Country, here they might fix in a Soil of so much more de∣sirable Habitation, that they might thank the Fates that caus'd the Change, and bless the Authors of their Misery. Here they might live without any dan∣ger of the Seas Incroaching upon their Banks, to threaten continually a second Deluge, and free from all dread of

Invasion from any Neighbouring Land-Tyrant. And might spread them∣selves over spacious Plains, which would afford them Work sufficient for all their Husbandry, and Pastures Pleasant and large enough for all their Cattle. And because nothing can please these People so much as Trade and Traffick, therefore here they might find conve∣nient Harbours for their Ships, by which they might keep up their Spi∣rit of Merchandizing, and establish their Commerce to the <HI>Indies</HI> and o∣ther parts of the World. The Refu∣gees of <HI>France,</HI> who are received here with the same priviledge the <HI>Dutch</HI> en∣joy, acknowledge the happiness of their Transportation; and boast that their Misfortunes are turn'd into their Felicity, since they are blest here with peaceable Dwellings and kind Accom∣modations, who had not formerly where in safety to lay their Heads.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Encou∣ragements to such as settle here.</NOTE>The Encouragements of such as come hither to Cultivate the Land for their own Livelihood and Benefit of the grand Proprietors, is thus stated, as I understood it. Those that design to settle here, are allow'd their Transpor∣tation

from <HI>Holland</HI> gratis. After their Arrival they are invited to range and view the Country, and survey such parts as lie wild and unmanur'd, where they may choose such a Portion as they fancy they are able to stock and Ma∣nure, and will yield them a Commo∣dious settlement for their Families. This is to be a Patrimony intail'd upon their Children, without any Rent or other Acknowledgment to the <HI>Dutch East In∣dia</HI> Company, but the Sale of their Goods to the Governour, and at his Price. This by the way presses hard upon the Tenants and keeps them un∣der, by running the chief Profits of what they possess into the Company's hands. The Governour and Council agree with the Country-man for his Goods and Cattle at a very low rate, and sell them again to the Ships that put in there, as dear as they please; because all Men are strain'd from vending any Commodities to Strangers without the Council's leave. But however the Industrious Planters want neither plenty of Wine for their Tables, nor variety of Tame and Wild Fowls for their ordinary Entertain∣ments, of which they have often ra∣ther
<PB N="502" REF="264"/>
too much Store than any Scarcity, because the Company has no occasion for them, and therefore they lie dead upon their Hands. Some upon this ac∣count quit the place, and very few of any Substance but easilier may increase their Goods than their Treasure.</P>
<P>Those whose Poverty renders them unable to stock their Land, the Kind∣ness of the Governour provides with Ne∣cessaries 'till their Abilities can reach a Payment. Which has mightily increas∣ed the number of Inhabitants within a few Years. For whereas about nine Years since, they could scarce reckon above four or five Hundred Planters, they can now number almost as many Thousands; abundance of whom were sent hither by the <HI>French</HI> Persecution, who are much delighted with the Con∣venience of their Dwelling.</P>

'Tis Colour'd like Rhenish, and therefore they pass it under that specious Name in <HI>India,</HI> but the Taste of it is much harder and less palatable; its Operations are more searching, and the strength of it more intoxicating and offensive to the Brain.</P>
<P>The Impositions which are laid upon Wine and other Liquors that are sold by Retail, seem almost incredible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Taxes upon Liquors.</NOTE> es∣pecially when the small number of People that are presum'd to drink them, is consider'd. For in the Town of the <HI>Cape</HI> are not reckon'd above 500 Inha∣bitants, besides those that are brought in Ships and come out of the Country; and yet the Annual Impost upon <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> Beer and Wine is four thousand Gilders; upon <HI>Cape</HI> Wine four thousand one hundred; and Brandy, Arak, and distill'd Waters, pay twenty Thousand
<PB N="504" REF="265"/>
Gilders Yearly to the Governour of the place for a License to sell them. All which Taxes summ'd together, make up above twenty eight Thousand Gil∣ders Yearly, which according to our Ac∣counts, raise between two and three Thousand Pounds, for the liberty of selling Liquors by Retail. This ex∣orbitant Fine upon the Taverns and Tipling Houses makes them exact ex∣travagant Rates from the Guests that drink the Liquor, who are indeed the People that pay it. For he that re∣solves to drink Brandy must pay at the rate of ten Shillings a Bottle for it; and the <HI>Cape</HI> Wine which in the Cask is sold for less than six Pence a Quart, is in the Tavern half a Crown, and such proportionably are the excessive Prices of the rest. A tame submission is the only Remedy for these Impositions, from which there is no Appeal or Relief, which is apt to imbitter the Lives of the People, nor can any be very happy, who are subject to the Tyranny of a Government that is under no Restraint. The Arbitrary Proceedings of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commissaries in <HI>India,</HI> have been much resented, and have likewise rais'd loud

<P>The fam'd Garden abundantly sup∣plies the Ships with variety of Roots and green Herbs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gar∣den at the <HI>Cape.</HI></NOTE> which contribute not a little to the Health, and even preserva∣tion of Life, in these tedious <HI>Eastern</HI> Voyages.

Here are those large Walks, those stately Hedg∣es, and Alleys of Cypres, and Beds of Flowers, which make it Beautiful and Pleasant as the Garden of a Prince, and useful as that of a Peasant. The Conve∣niencies it abounds with may denomi∣nate it a Kitchih Garden, but its De∣lights a Garden of Pleasure. It is of large Extent, at some distance from the high Mountains, but cut out upon a rising Hill, water'd with pure Springs descending from the Mountains, which make their Passage thro' various Channels that are cut out in every Quarter. The Garden in all its Walks is kept so very neat and clean, that even in the Winter Season, scarce a Leaf is seen upon the Ground. The Trees are Curiously Prun'd, and the Hedges Trim'd with such exactness, that no one irregular Excrescence ap∣pears, or Branch shooting out beyond his Fellow. Much of the Fruit in it comes to maturity twice a Year, and many Trees by their nearness to the Sun, are verdant and Beautiful all the Year.

<P>The method made use of in taking the Turtle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Discourse concerning the Turtle.</NOTE> is carefully to observe those particular times they come on Shoar, to lay or hatch their Eggs, at which times they turn them by surprizal upon their Backs, which is a Posture they are utterly unable to recover from, and are thereby frustrated of all Defence or Escape, and are a ready Prey to any that resolves to seize them. When the sensible Creatures find themselves in this desperate Posture, by which they know themselves in a lost and hopeless state, they then begin to lament their Condi∣tion in many heavy sighs, and mourn∣ful Groans, and shed abundance of water from their Eyes, in hopes, if possible, to secure their Safety by their Tears, and Mollifie the cruel Assaults upon their Lives. They are of celebra∣ted strength, much beyond the Pro∣portion of their Bulk, so much that I have seen one of a small size, not a∣bove

eight Inches Broad, able to su∣stain the weight of a Man. And the inward strength of their Animal Spi∣rits is equal to that of their outward Contexture, which is not easily abated or dissolved. For after the Neck of one of these had been quite cut off, ex∣cept only a small piece of Skin by which it hung to the Body; and after its Bowels were ripp'd up, and its Heart was taken out, and plac'd upon the Deck of the Ship, it both open'd its Mouth, and the Heart for a long time after had a motion; which some of the Spectators affirm'd would continue for the space of two or three Hours; and some of them have been known to live twelve Hours after their Heads have been cut off. The parts of Reptiles con∣tinue, I think, animated for some consi∣derable time after they are dissected from one another, because of the viscous Quality of their Animal Spirits, but for the Heart of so large an Animal as this, to move for some Hours after it was torn from the Body, seems a little more strange and surprizing.

<P>Of the Turtle or Marine Tortoise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three sorts of Turtles.</NOTE> there are three sorts, the Hawk-Bill, the Logerhead, and the Green Turtle, which swim in the Water, and creep upon Land.

The two Fins of it pla∣ced before, are in the shape of Wings; those two behind are broad and long like Feet, and its Head and Eyes, which it opens and shuts, resemble those of a Hawk; so that both in its shape and other qualities, the Body of it is divi∣ded among those Creatures whose pro∣per Elements are Land, Water, and
<PB N="518" REF="272"/>
Air. The flesh of it is White, and Eats beyond any Veal, and admirably contributes to the Cure of the Scurvey, and as it's commonly affirmed, the Im∣pure Disease. But the <HI>Dutch,</HI> notwith∣standing the delicacy, will not touch it; and the Barbarity of the <HI>French,</HI> af∣ter they have been satiated with their Plenty, expose them to starve and stink above Ground, by leaving many of them turn'd upon their Backs, upon their departure from the Island. The <HI>English</HI> treat none cruelly, but turn on∣ly such as are necessary for their Re∣freshment, being loath to express a se∣verity to the very Beasts, especially such whose Deaths contribute so consi∣derably to the Health, and support of their own Lives. Great plenty of these Shel-Fish are found in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> the Genitals of which dried, and drunk in Wine, are prescribed as singular Dissolvers of the Stone. The store of them upon this Island, where so little Herbage grows, seems to supply the Necessity of green Herbs for Curing the Scorbutick Humours in the Mar∣riners, to which nothing does contri∣bute more; as we happily experiment∣ed
<PB N="519" REF="272"/>
in the Voyage. For three or four <HI>French</HI> Vineroons designed for St. <HI>Hele∣na,</HI> were so lamentably over-run with the Scurvey, after we had spent two or three Months at Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scur∣vey Cur'd by Eating green herbs</NOTE> that they were unable either to walk or stand upright; and yet three days eating of Purslain and other Herbs, after we were landed in <HI>Africa,</HI> rectifyed the ill Humours in the Blood, restor'd their Limbs, and recover'd their Stomachs and lost Health again. And were those made more fre∣quently the Diet of these that live on Land, as they are sometimes of those at Sea, I doubt not but the Scorbutick Humours, and all that Train of Disea∣ses that follows them, would be less numerous and prevailing than they are.</P>
<P>Upon this Island is a certain place nam'd the <HI>Post-Office,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Post-Office.</NOTE> from the Letters left there by the last Commander that came thither, giving an Account of the time he came there, when he departed from the Island, and what other News of moment he thinks convenient. The Letter is commonly thrust into a Bottle corked close, which the succeeding Commander breaks in pieces to come to it, and leaves another
<PB N="520" REF="273"/>
in its stead. But I will leave this Barren Island, and proceed on the Voyage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A day set apart for the invok∣ing a Bles∣sing upon the Voyage.</NOTE>About the middle of our Passage from the <HI>Cape</HI> to <HI>Europe,</HI> the Captain Commandant of the Fleet called a Coun∣cil of all the Commanders, and then enjoyn'd a particular Day to be set a∣part by every Ship, as a publick Thanks∣giving for our past safety, and for im∣ploring the Favour and Benediction of Heaven upon the Fleet for the rest of the Voyage; and desir'd from me a Form of Prayer, which was tran∣slated into <HI>Dutch</HI> for that purpose.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF A Late Revolution IN THE KINGDOM OF <HI>GOLCONDA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Account of this Revolution, and those other matters which are discours'd of in this Appen∣dix, might have fallen in very luckily in some part of the preceding Voyage,
<PB N="526" REF="276"/>
had I been so fortunate as to have had the perusal of the Papers while the Book was a finishing; but not coming to my Hands 'till it was Printed, I thought it best to affix them to it, as both agreeable to the Subject, and con∣taining things in them very remarkable and New: And must needs own the peculiar Obligation I am under to a very worthy Gentleman, Mr. <HI>Daniel Sheldon,</HI> in the free and kind Commu∣nication of these Memoirs. I shall not therefore detain the Reader with a∣ny further account of this matter, but pass on to what I am satisfied will be very agreeable to him, <HI>viz.</HI> The Histo∣ry of this Revolution in <HI>Golconda.</HI></P>
<P>The present King of <HI>Golconda</HI> was Son to an <HI>Arabian</HI> of good Family and Esteem, but low in Estate and Fortune; to raise which, resolving to Travel, and seek Employment from some Foreign Prince, he came to <HI>Golconda;</HI> and, by the Favour of some persons of Quality, had the opportunity of presenting him∣self and his Service to King <HI>Cotub sha;</HI> who, being pleased with his Person and manner of Address, gave him a small Government, wherein he behav'd
<PB N="527" REF="276"/>
himself so well, that he was advanc'd to one of the most considerable Com∣mands in the Kingdom, in which and his Prince's favour he continued 'till his Death: After which his Estate (being very great) was seiz'd on by the King, who is the general Heir of all his Nobles and Persons employ'd by him (none of those Countreys having any Heredita∣ry Estates) so that his Son was reduc'd to a very poor Condition; but, ha∣ving that left which could not be ta∣ken from him, <HI>viz.</HI> his Father's Wit and Courage, he resolv'd to follow his Example, hoping to find his Fortune. Full of which hopes he enters himself into <HI>Munsub</HI> (that is, the Kings Pay) and had allow'd him twelve or fifteen new <HI>Pagotha</HI>'s (which is about four Pounds sixteen Shillings, or six Pounds Sterling) <HI>per</HI> Month, with which, and the hopes of better Preferment, he made a shift to maintain himself. The King <HI>Cotub-sha</HI> had at this time no Son, but three Daughters; the Eldest of which was Married to Sultan <HI>Mamood,</HI> Eldest Son to the <HI>Great Mogul, Aureng-Zebe:</HI> The second to an <HI>Arabian</HI> of great Quality, <HI>Meera Mamood;</HI> and the
<PB N="528" REF="277"/>
third was unmarried: To this unmar∣ried Daughter an <HI>Arabian</HI> of high Birth and Quality called <HI>Siud Sultan,</HI> was an importunate Suitor; and the King grown Old, and oppress'd with the Fa∣ctions of those to whom he had left the management of Affairs (having all his time wholly minded Pleasures, and left Business and the Concerns of the King∣dom to the Cares of others) and mor∣tally hating Sultan <HI>Mamood</HI> (who by a cruel War, almost to the utter Ruine of him and his Kingdom, had forc'd his Consent to the Marryage of his Eldest Daughter, hoping thereby, after <HI>Cotub-sha</HI>'s Death, to add the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda</HI> to the Empire of the <HI>Great Mogul)</HI> and having no Kindness for his second Daughter or her Husband, but being extreamly fond of his Youngest, he design'd to Marry her to one whose Quality, Parts, and Courage, might make him able either to break or ma∣nage the Factions of his Court; with∣stand Sultan <HI>Mamood,</HI> who he resolv'd should not succeed him; and one, who being rais'd by his Favour, he thought would wholly depend upon it, and there∣by only expect the Succession. And
<PB N="529" REF="277"/>
this Young Servant to his Daughter, being an <HI>Arabian</HI> (who in these Coun∣treys are thought the Wisest and fit∣test for Government) and of the Cast of the <HI>Siuds</HI> (that is of the Family or Kindred of <HI>Mahumet,</HI> and there∣fore much reverenc'd by all) likewise of a brisk and lively Wit and Spirit: He thought him a fit Person by whom to manage his Designs, and conse∣quently to Marry his Daughter; there∣fore countenanc'd his Adresses to her; but the young Man was so dazled with the prospect of so glorious a Fortune, that he could not see his right way to it; for, presuming too soon upon the King and Princesses Fa∣vour, instead of contriving how to in∣crease and strengthen his Interest, by gaining the Consent and Support of the great Ministers of State; he car∣ried himself so insolently towards them, that he utterly disoblig'd, and made himself hateful to them; and they fear∣ing the Tyranny of one who, when their Equal, began to exercise it over them, resolv'd to disgrace and ruin him, by hindring the Match. The chiefest Persons about the King, were <HI>Moso
<PB N="530" REF="278"/>
Cawne, Siud Meer Zapher,</HI> and <HI>Musshuke,</HI> these three managed the King and his great Affairs; for <HI>Meera Mamood,</HI> the King's Son in Law, being not in Fa∣vour, was not in Business; yet not so quite laid aside, but that he had free Access to the Court and Presence, and was by all respected as one, that ha∣ving Married the King's Second Daughter (Circumstances consider'd) was likely enough to succeed him. Therefore having great hopes (and not enduring the Insolent Carriage of this new Favourite, nor to think of his Marrying the King's beloved Daugh∣ter) put himself in the Head of the Faction against him: And the Old Courtiers perfectly knowing the King, and the usual and surest ways of work∣ing him to their Designs, soon unsetled the unwary young Man in his Af∣fections, and then threw him from the height of his Prince's Favour, to the contempt and scorn of the meanest Subject. For they possessed his Ma∣jesty with an Opinion, that he was an high Spirited, Ambitious Man, and aim'd at great things; that he was at the Head of a great Party and Facti∣on
<PB N="531" REF="278"/>
at Court; that if he were once strengthen'd with so near an Alliance to the King, he might do whatsoever he design'd; what he design'd they knew not, but he gave them great Reason to fear, it was not his Maje∣sty's safety, nor the Kingdom's Peace; and Affairs being wholy manag'd by their Directions, and all Officers at Court about the King being their Creatures, they made their Information seem more than probable. The King being naturally jealous, and frighted with the Shadow of any thing that he thought might disturb his Pleasures, was quickly perswaded not to marry the Princess to so dangerous a Person, and immediately upon the breaking off the Match, one of the three Persons before mention'd, ('tis not certainly known which of them, but thought <HI>Musshuke)</HI> advis'd his Majesty to find out some one for the Princess of small Fortune, but noble Birth and Courage; a comly Person, and of a generous and chearful Disposition, and inclin'd ra∣ther to Pleasures than Business; for, if he was qualified with high Birth, and the Endowments of Nature, it lay in
<PB N="532" REF="279"/>
the King's Power to supply the Defects of Honour, Riches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Men of such Dispositions (being given to Plea∣sure) were seldom ambitious or de∣signing; therefore such a one being Created meerly by his Favour, would wholly submit by it, and enjoying what he most desir'd, (his Pleasures) would not disturb himself or them with the thoughts of Business, or Cares of Government, but be Obedient and perfectly contented with the Condition he was in, without aspiring to un∣timely Greatness. The Advice was liked, and communicated to the two o∣ther Counselors, who (considering it was a way for continuing them in their Governments, and all Affairs and Busi∣ness in their management) confirmed the King, by approving of the Coun∣sel given him; and having his Order to find out such a Person, the Young <HI>Arabian</HI> Souldier (whose Father's E∣state had been seiz'd on by the King) was propos'd as one every way qua∣lified according to the King's desire. He is therefore sent for by <HI>Ziud Meer Zapher</HI> to his House, and (the King be∣ing plac'd where he might perfectly
<PB N="533" REF="279"/>
see and hear, without being taken no∣tice of) <HI>Ziud Meer Zapher</HI> entertain'd the Young Souldier with some Discourse concerning the Greatness and Merits of his Father; how much he was belov'd and favour'd by the King; told him he was sorry to see the Son of so great a Man in so low a Condition; promis'd his Assistance in getting some handsom Command for him; bid him there∣fore be chearful and not dejected and Melancholy: And after he thought the King had fully view'd, dismiss'd him. When he was gone, the King told <HI>Ziud Meer Zapher,</HI> he was not so comly a Person as he was presented to be, nor had he that Life and Vigour in his Countenance, that he would wil∣lingly have in the Person he made choice of. To which <HI>Meer Zapher</HI> re∣ply'd, that his Majesty rather saw his Misfortunes than the Man himself; for, being the Son of so great a Person, and having liv'd in all the plenty of his Father's Great Estate, to be now reduc'd to the poor Condition and Al∣lowance of an Ordinary Horse-man, must of necessity make melancholy Im∣pressions both upon his Body and
<PB N="534" REF="280"/>
Mind; but if his Wants were supply∣ed with Money to maintain him ac∣cording to his Birth and Quality, he would quickly come to, and appear like himself, and to be such a one as his Majesty sought for. The King re∣solves to try, and therefore orders <HI>Meer Zapher</HI> to contrive how to fur∣nish him with as much Money as he would have, without letting him know the Bountiful Hand that reliev'd him. Immediately some <HI>Xeruffs,</HI> (or Money Merchants) are sent for, and <HI>Meer Za∣pher</HI> gives them directions to offer and let him have as much Money as he would take, promising to see them re∣paid again; but strictly Commanded them (upon the forfeiture, not only of their Money, but Lives) not to let him know they had any such Order to fur∣nish him. Away the <HI>Xeruffs</HI> go and give him several Visits, under a pretence of desiring his Assistance in some Business they had with some great Men; for, he being a Man of high Birth and Quality (such Persons tho' never so poor, being by all much respected in those Countries) would have better Access, and be sooner heard and ta∣ken
<PB N="535" REF="280"/>
notice of. After two or three Vi∣sits, growing more familiar with him, they told him he looked Melancholy and Discontented, and desir'd to know if it were for want of any thing with which they could furnish him; if Mo∣ney, they would supply him with a∣ny Sum he would please to take; and desir'd him to try them for two or three Thousand Old <HI>Pagotha's,</HI> (which is about a Thousand or fifteen Hun∣dred Pounds Sterling) His Wants made him ready enough to take Money, but (considering who they were that of∣fer'd it, and that such kindnesses from such Men were always paid for at the dearest Rates) though his Condition was bad, he was unwilling to make it worse, by putting himself into such Mens Clutches; for, being once in their Debts, he could not foresee any hopes of ever getting out, and there∣fore would not sacrifice his Liberty, and the little Content he had left, to his Inclination (which but two ear∣nestly perswaded him to enjoy the present Conveniences of the Money offer'd, without troubling himself with the Thoughts of future Payment) but
<PB N="536" REF="281"/>
resolv'd to content himself in his Wants, till they were by some better and more agreeable way provided for: So re∣fus'd their Money, but accepted of their Kindness in the most grateful and obliging manner he possibly could. But at last the importunity of the <HI>Xe∣ruffs,</HI> and his own Wants, prevail'd up∣on him to receive a considerable Sum, for which (to his great Admiration) they were so far from taking Security, (as accustomary) that they perswaded him not to spare his Money, but to live like the Son of so great a Father, offering him more, when that which he had received was spent. The young Man, naturally inclin'd to Gallantry and high Living, being thus plentiful∣ly supplyed with the Means, resolves to please and appear like himself with a handsom House, Retinue, Palan∣keen, Horses, and all things fit for a Person of his Quality; more wonder∣ing at the Merchants for lending, than at himself for Spending so much Mo∣ney. All this while <HI>Siud Meer Zapher</HI> had his Eye upon him, and quickly perceived the alteration he expected both in his Person and Humour, and
<PB N="537" REF="281"/>
that he began to be very much e∣steem'd and respected by all that knew him: So desires the King to see him again, which he does, and now so well likes him, that he gives <HI>Meer Zapher</HI> Order to let him have as many oppor∣tunities of seeing him as he could; and the oftner he does see, the more he is pleas'd and taken with him: There∣fore resolving to Marry his Daughter immediately to him, one Evening he sends the <HI>Deveer</HI> or Secretary of State, with an <HI>Omrah</HI> (or Noble Man) called <HI>Jabber Beague,</HI> and a Guard of Horse, to fetch and Conduct him to Court. The Young Gallant was entertaining some Friends and himself with some Dancing Women, when News was brought him that some great Officers belonging to the Court, were at the Door; away went his Friends and Women by a Back-way, and he to meet the Secretary and <HI>Jabber Beague,</HI> to conduct them in: As soon as he saw them (well knowing who they were) he was very much troubled, not imagining why so Eminent Per∣sons with a Guard of Horse, should come to visit him: And his Fears
<PB N="538" REF="282"/>
were very much increas'd by a rich Vest with which the Secretary pre∣sented him with from the King: <HI>For verily believing it was poison'd, he desir'd them to Excuse him, for being so sur∣priz'd, that he could not tell whether to receive the King's Present as his Honour or Disgrace and Ruine; for his Father's Services being long since Rewarded and for∣got, and he having never yet the opportu∣nity of doing his Majesty any, he could not expect any honourable Notice could be ta∣ken of him; and yet he was in hopes he less deserv'd Punishment than Reward, since he could not call to mind any one Crime he had committed in his whole Life, that might give his Majesty the least, or any Of∣fence: And if his late living in a more plentiful way than formerly had been taken notice of, and was displeasing, he did as∣sure them he had no other design in it, than to appear according to his Birth and Quality; that upon the least Command or notice he would have retir'd to his former Obscurity; that he had done no unjust thing to get the Money he spent, but would have been willing to have given, either his Majesty or them an Account how he did get it. Then he told them he always
<PB N="539" REF="282"/>
had been, and still was so truly Loyal to his Prince; that he should upon all occasions, freely have ventur'd his Life for his Ser∣vice, and now durst lose it for his Pleasure. So snatching the Vest for to put it on, he desir'd the Secretary to present his humble Duty to the King, and tell him he very much fear'd he would have more reason to Cherish and Preserve such Subjects as he was, than to delight and sport himself in the Contrivance of their Deaths.</HI></P>
<P>The Secretary was, by Order, strict∣ly to observe both what he said, and how he behav'd himself, and there∣fore did not interrupt him, but per∣mitted none but himself and <HI>Jabber Beague</HI> to help him on with his Vest; after which with a low <HI>Salam</HI> (or Reve∣rence) he told him they were not sent by the King to Execute any Sentence of his Displeasure, but to conduct him to his Favour, and the greatest Ho∣nour he could bestow upon him; there∣fore desir'd him to go along with them chearfully and immediately. So with them he goes, not very well assur'd of his Safety, 'till they brought him a goodly Horse with rich Furniture, and desir'd him to mount, which he did,
<PB N="540" REF="283"/>
and betwixt the Secretary and <HI>Jabber Beague</HI> rode to Court, where he was the same Night Married to the Prin∣cess: And the whole business was ma∣naged with so much privacy, that <HI>Mee∣ra Mamood</HI> (who had Married the King's second Daughter) had not the least knowledge of it, 'till it was pub∣lickly declared to whom the King had Married the Young Princess: Which made <HI>Meera Mamood</HI> almost mad with Rage, railing at the King, and his Nobility; but perceiving no body took notice of it, but those that laugh'd at and despis'd him, he left the Court and Kingdom, and went to <HI>Delly,</HI> where making his Addresses to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> he was kindly enter∣tain'd, and allow'd a Royal Pension. The King is every Day more and more satisfied with his Son in Law, yet (be∣ing resolv'd not to trust him with any Command or Business, nor to give him any opportunity of inriching himself, or getting more Money than he spent) gives him no <HI>Munsub</HI> (that is no Com∣mand of Souldiers, nor Government of any place or Province) and orders one of his Eunuchs constantly to pay his
<PB N="541" REF="283"/>
Expences be they never so great, but not to furnish him with any Money, thereby to give him opportunity of lay∣ing up any. The Young Sultan ha∣ving an Excellent Understanding, quick∣ly perceiv'd the Design, and wisely re∣solv'd to comply with it, and be whol∣ly govern'd and manag'd by the King's pleasure, without taking any notice of his Jealousie: So he seems not to care for, nor so much as to think of any Command, Business, or getting of more Money than would pay for his Pleasures, which did not only fix the <HI>Omrahs</HI> (or Nobles) and Governours to him (they verily believing that if he were once King, they should be all such in their general Governments) but made the King himself even dote on him, as a Man sent from Heaven to Marry his Daughter, being just such a Person, as in his thoughts he had wish'd for. He therefore contrives by all the ways he could desire to secure the Succession to him, for, being sick and worn with Age and Pleasures (to which he had been all his time wholly addicted) and think∣ing he should die, he summons all his <HI>Omrahs</HI> before him, and publickly de∣clares
<PB N="542" REF="284"/>
for his Successor <HI>Sultan Abdulla Hoosan</HI> his Son in Law; conjuring them by the last Request of their Dying King to settle him (after his Death) in the Throne, and to submit to his Government; making them, one by one, not only promise, but swear upon their Alcharon to perform what he had com∣manded; after which he immediately dyed, having liv'd above Eleven Years since the Marriage of his beloved Daughter, who in that space of time had comforted him with a Son and two Daughters. The King was no sooner dead, but his second Daughter (Wife to <HI>Meera Mamood)</HI> having made a small Party, seizes upon, and secures the Palace on the behalf of a Son her Husband had by a former Wife, (for by her he had none) whom she endea∣vour'd to make King; but <HI>Moso Cawne, Siud Meer Zapher,</HI> and <HI>Musshuke,</HI> quick∣ly suppressed the Tumult she had made, and immediatel proclaim'd <HI>Sultan Abdul∣la Hoosan Potshaw,</HI> or Prince <HI>Abdulla Hoosan</HI> Emperour.</P>
<P>After all the Ceremonies both of a Funeral and Coronation were per∣form'd, the King begins to think of
<PB N="543" REF="284"/>
gratifying those that had made him so; for tho' he had long observ'd <HI>Moso Cawne,</HI> and <HI>Siud Meer Zapher,</HI> to be cor∣rupt and ill Governours, yet they had done him good Service, and he could not, without lessening his Name in the World, but continue, and something increase their Honour and Commands: (nor perchance was it in his power to lessen them in either, since those that had made him King, might still be made able to make another so) yet it very much troubled him to think he should add to the too great Power they already had; therefore taking some little time to consider what was fit for him to do, at last he concludes, that the way to lessen these two powerful Noble-men, was to make them both too great, for very well knowing they mortally hated one another, and would never endure each others greatness, but be always striving which should throw the other out of his Prince's Favour, he therefore resolv'd so to divide the Ad∣ministration of Affairs between them, that they should be sure to check one the other, and to carry himself so e∣qually, that it should not be discern'd
<PB N="544" REF="285"/>
which he most favour'd; by which he both answer'd the Opinion the World had of his Bounty, (a thing much re∣garded) in rewarding them with Ho∣nour and great Imployments, and yet secur'd himself from the danger of two such powerful Subjects, by making them too great ever to agree in an At∣tempt against him; and setting them both up at so equal and spreading a height, that they must of necessity justle one another down; concluding they could not be dangerous to him, while they were so to one another; and sought only by the advantage of his Favour to ruine each other. To <HI>Moso Cowne</HI> he therefore gives the Title of <HI>Cawne Cawna,</HI> and being a Man of Courage, makes him General of his Army. To <HI>Siud Meer Zapher</HI> he gives the Title of <HI>Emir Zemla,</HI> and being a Man of Business, makes him <HI>Duan</HI> (in which Office is comprehended both that of a Chancellour and Treasurer) so that the General being to receive the Army's Pay of the <HI>Duan</HI> was sure to find delays and affronts, and the <HI>Duan</HI> being by his Place to inspect into the Disposal of the King's Money, and Payment of the
<PB N="545" REF="285"/>
After the King had honoured and Re∣warded others likewise that deserved well of him, he seems wholly to re∣tire from Business to his Pleasures; but posted himself at so convenient a Di∣stance, that he had perfect Knowledge of every thing that pass'd. In this time of leasure he would often sequester himself from all kind of Company, to meditate and write; and its since cer∣tainly known, that when he was thus retir'd, he took particular notice of all the Abuses in the State, and the best ways of redressing them; likewise set down in Writing several Rules and Maxims for his future Government.</P>
<P>In the mean time the two great men (or rather Kings) strove who should procure the finest Women, best Min∣strels and Dancers to divert the King, thinking by such Charms to continue him in the Lethargy they thought he was in. But what the Wise Prince foresaw soon came to pass; for they (not enduring each others Greatness, and inrag'd at the equal Favour of the King) endeavour'd, by finding out mat∣ter of Accusation aginst, to ruin each o∣ther; and the <HI>Duan</HI> (being by his place
<PB N="546" REF="286"/>
to inspect into the Payment of the Ar∣my) receiv'd many Complaints against the General, whose wretched love of Money made him defraud the King and his Souldiers of great Sums. Of this the <HI>Duan</HI> complains to the King, who seems not to believe, and takes little notice of it. The <HI>Duan</HI> therefore resolving to bring such Evidence as should convince the King of the Truth of his Complaint, seizes the General's <HI>Braman</HI> or Accountant, who kept all the Accounts of the Army; at which the General is so inrag'd, that taking some Souldiers with him, he is resolv'd to go and cut the <HI>Duan</HI> in pieces; but the <HI>Duan,</HI> being a notorious Coward, is the more careful to have Valiant Men about him, and always paying them well, they now serve him faith∣fully, stoutly defending him against the General, 'till the King sent and Commanded him to retire. At first he was so out of his Wits, that he would not, but (being perswaded by better temper'd Men, and his Friends) at last he return'd to his own House, leaving the <HI>Duan</HI> half dead with Fear; who coming to himself, goes immedi∣ately
<PB N="547" REF="286"/>
to the King, and desires him to consider with what safety he could be in his Palace, if such Outrages were committed in the Garrison. The King calmly tells him, he will take care both for his own, and his future safety, by preventing such Violences for the time to come, and by perfectly reconciling the General to him; and tho' the <HI>Duan</HI> knew that to be impossible, yet seems to go away contented. The King sends to the General to let him know that he had undertaken a Reconcilia∣tion, and therefore would have him frame himself to it; but he storms, and calls the <HI>Duan</HI> a thousand Names; at last better remembring, calms himself, returns the King Thanks, and a sub∣mission to what he shall Command. Some few days after the King sends for him (as accustomary) and he (ha∣ving by that time considered the rash∣ness of what he had done) is unwilling to go, but (being perswaded by some he thought Friends, there was no dan∣ger, and that the King had inwardly more kindness for him than for the <HI>Du∣an)</HI> to Court he goes, and was no soon∣er entred the <HI>Palace Yard,</HI> but is seiz'd
<PB N="548" REF="287"/>
on, and clapt into Irons and Prison.</P>
<P>The Charge against him was for slighting the King's Commands; da∣ring to assault one of his Counsellours within his Garrison; purloyning the King's Treasure, and converting it to his own Use; and for refusing to pay several Sums of Money to the Embas∣sadours of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> very much to the Dishonour of the King; (he ha∣ving pass'd his word for the punctual Payment of them) for which and some other things he was Imprison'd, and had all his Estate seiz'd on; in his House being found in ready Money, Five Hundred Thousand new <HI>Pagotha</HI>'s (which is about Two Hundred Thou∣sand Pounds Sterling) besides Jewels, wherein he was very Rich, having for many Years been Governour of the <HI>Diamond</HI> Mine of <HI>Coulour.</HI> Immedi∣ately after he was seiz'd on, the King muster'd the Army, pays them their Arrears, gives the Command to <HI>Mus∣shuke;</HI> but, to their great satisfaction, in∣rolls them in his own Rolls, and pro∣miseth to take care of them himself for the Future. The <HI>Duan</HI> is infinitely pleas'd at the fall of the General, and
<PB N="549" REF="287"/>
thinking he had no Equal in the King's Favour, takes upon him to meddle in every Man's matter, depriving seve∣ral of the Benefit of their Places, by taking their Business out of their Hands; and the King lets him go on without taking notice of small Presumptions, so that by degrees he grows so confident of his own Authority, and the King's neglect, that he begins to do things of the greatest Consequence, without ac∣quainting his Majesty; and at last (ha∣ving made himself hateful, by doing and undoing every Man's Business, according to his own Interest and De∣signs) his Ruin was so generally wish'd, that there was a necessity of removing so great a grievance; which gave the King a fit opportunity of doing what he had so long design'd. Notice is there∣fore given, that such a Morning the King intends to appear at the <HI>Durbar;</HI> (that is at the place where he usually shows himself to his Nobles) so that the <HI>Duan</HI> and all the rest of his <HI>Omrahs</HI> (or Nobles) were to come according to Custom to make their <HI>Salam.</HI> When the King was sat, and had a little look'd about him, he commands the <HI>Duan</HI> to
<PB N="550" REF="288"/>
stand before him, and began to speak to him in so obliging a manner, that every one at first verily thought he de∣sign'd him some fresh Honour, and not Disgrace; telling him how particular a kindness he always had for his Per∣son; how great a Confidence in his Fi∣delities and Abilities; insomuch that he had left almost the whole Affairs of his Kingdom to his management, ma∣king him, as it were, King in Power, and contenting himself only with the Name: But that, to his extreme Dis∣content, he found himself quite de∣ceived in him; for he had made use of the good Opinion he had of him, and his own great Abilities, only to Affront his King, and oppress and wrong his fellow Subjects. Then in the sharpest Language he could speak, tells him of all his Insolencies and Affronts, by pre∣suming to do things of the greatest consequence without acquainting him; likewise reckons up all the Miscarriages of his Administration; then telling him, that he preferring his own Honour, and the good of the Publick, even be∣fore his own Life, he could not expect he should spare his, but Sacrifice it to
<PB N="551" REF="288"/>
his own Vindication and publick Justice, on the behalf of his oppress'd and in∣jur'd Subjects: However as a Reward of some former good Services he had done, he gave him his Life and the Go∣vernment of such a Province, com∣manding him immediately (upon the forfeiture of both) to retire to his Go∣vernment, and for the future not to meddle with any Business but what concern'd it. And so, without further Disgrace, dismiss'd him, not permit∣ting any to affront him, but command∣ing all to respect him as the Governour of a Province.</P>
<P>The King, with Reputation, and the infinite satisfaction of his People, having thus lad aside his two Partners in the Government (as if he thought himself then and not before a King) leaves his Retirement; dismisses the lew'd Women and Dancers; and breaks the Charms of his former Pleasures, with the Thoughts of Business; which he wholly minds and delights in; appears frequently at the <HI>Durbar;</HI> inspects into the whole Affairs of his King∣dom; calls for all the Accounts of
<PB N="552" REF="289"/>
his Revenues, the auditing of which he leaves to <HI>Musshuke</HI> (who is now the Favourite) rewards bountifully; punishes not with Death, but other ways, very severely; giving his People great assurance of being happily Go∣vern'd for the future, by a Wise and most excellent King.</P>

It is bound∣ed on the <HI>North-West</HI> by the King∣dom of <HI>Bengala,</HI> some Authors making
<PB N="554" REF="290"/>
<HI>Chatigam</HI> to be its first Frontier City; but <HI>Texeira,</HI> and generally the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> Writers, reckon that as a City of <HI>Bengala;</HI> and not only so, but place the City of <HI>Bengala</HI> it self upon the same Coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baudrand.</NOTE> more <HI>South</HI> than <HI>Chatigam.</HI> Tho' I confess a late <HI>French</HI> Geographer has put <HI>Bengala</HI> into his Catalogue of ima∣ginary Cities, and such as have no real Existence in the World; but I wish he had given us a more particular ac∣count of his Reasons. Along the Coast which is wash'd by the foremention'd <HI>Golph,</HI> it is extended as far as the Cape, called by the <HI>Portuguese, Nigraes,</HI> where it touches upon <HI>Pegu,</HI> and is inclos'd by it on the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>East.</HI> Towards the <HI>North</HI> it borders upon <HI>Ava</HI> But to fix all these limits to a determinated Point, is altogether impossible, by rea∣son of those frequent Alterations, and new Conquests, that are made on the one side or the other daily.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arracan.</NOTE>The Metropolis <HI>Arracan,</HI> from whence the Kingdom it self takes its Denomination, is situate in the middle of a Valley, containing no less than fif∣teen Miles in compass, and being in∣viron'd on all sides with a continued
<PB N="555" REF="290"/>
Ridge of steep and craggy Mountains, which serve it instead of Walls; and appear on the inside as such, being ar∣tificially cut to resemble the Fortifica∣tions of a strong City. The Outlets, which serve for Gates, are hewn out of the Rocks by main force, and being defended by Bulwarks, make the City impregnable. Besides these outward Fortifications, it is defended by a Castle of that incredible strength, that the King of <HI>Brama</HI> coming against it with Three Hundred Thousand Men, and Forty Thousand Elephants, was forc'd to raise the Siege with Disgrace. Thro' the Valley runs a large River, which <HI>Maginus</HI> calls <HI>Chaberis,</HI> which dividing it self into several little Rivolets and Streams, passes thro' all the streets, af∣fording thereby a wonderful Advantage to the City, by the ready Conveyance of all sorts of Merchandises and Pro∣visions unto every part thereof. At its parting from the City, which is said to be about Forty Five, or Fifty Miles from the Sea, all these little Rivolets are Collected again into two Channels, which opening towards the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South,</HI> at length fall Westward into the
<PB N="556" REF="291"/>
Gulph of <HI>Bengala,</HI> that towards the <HI>North</HI> at <HI>Orietan,</HI> and the other at <HI>Do∣bazi</HI> or <HI>Duabacam,</HI> both which places are much frequented by Merchants; but the alternate Ebbings and Flow∣ings of the Sea are so violent, especial∣ly about the time of the Full Moon, that the Ships can hardly ride safely in the Ports. But before we leave <HI>Arra∣can,</HI> to speak of these places, it will be convenient to say something of its Buildings, which are indeed ordinari∣ly mean; tho' there are several spaci∣ous <HI>Piazza</HI>'s or <HI>Bazars,</HI> which afford both Conveniences for Markets, and tolerable Prospects to the Spectators. For Timber they make use of <HI>Bambou</HI> Cane, and instead of Nails, tie the pieces together with the smaller sort of the same Cane, which when slender and Green, is so pliable, that it may be wreathed and twisted as you please. The Princes and Nobiliry make use of a different sort of Wood, and are very profuse in adorning the Insides of their Houses with exquisite Carvings and Guildings. Nor are their common sort destitute of Ornaments to set off and Beautifie them. The Palace Royal is
<PB N="557" REF="291"/>
vastly large, but not so beautiful for its structure. It is supported with large and tall Pillars, made of whole Trees, and cover'd over with Gold, with Chambers above built with the most precious and odoriferous Wood the <HI>East</HI> will afford, as Red and White Sandal, and a sort of <HI>Bois de Aquila.</HI> In the Middle, and as it were Center of the Palace, stands a great Hall, which they call the <HI>Golden House,</HI> because the Inside is wholly over-laid with Gold, from the Bottom to the Top, and o∣ver a rais'd place hangs a Canopy of Massy Gold, round which hang above an Hundred <HI>Combalenghe,</HI> as they call them, which are large Wedges of the same Mettal, made in the Fashion of Sugar-Loaves, each of above Forty Pound weigbt. Here also are to be seen seven Idols of massie Gold like∣wise, of the heighth of an ordinary Man, and about two Fingers in thick∣ness, but within hollow; which are al∣so adorn'd with precious Stones, Ru∣bies, Emeralds, Saphirs, and Diamonds, of an exiraordinary Bigness, upon their Foreheads, Breasts, and Arms, and a∣bout their Middles. In the midst of
<PB N="558" REF="292"/>
this Hall stands a square Stool, of three Hands breadth, all of pure Gold, which supports a Cabinet of pure Gold also, and overlaid with precious Stones, con∣taining the two <HI>Caneques, i. e.</HI> two fa∣mous Pendants made in the Form of two Pyramids, of two Rubies of the length of a Man's little Finger, and the Circumference at the base, as wide as that of an ordinary Pullets Egg.</P>
<P>The Quarrel about these Jewels is said to have caused as much Blood∣shed among the Neighbouring Kings hereabouts, as might have been suffici∣ent for the obtaining an entire Em∣pire; the Contest being not so much for the value of the Jewels, as that they are suppos'd to bring along with them a right, or at least a claim of Do∣minion over the Neighbouring Princes. And now they are in the Hands of this King, but never worn by him, except upon the Day of his Coronation. In a∣nother Apartment stands the Statue of the King of <HI>Brama,</HI> treacherously Murther'd by his Subjects, so natural and to the Life, that it causes Admira∣tion in all the Spectators, which are ve∣ry Numerous, he having obtain'd the
<PB N="559" REF="292"/>
Reputation of a great Saint, and being fam'd for Curing the Diseases of those that resort to him; especially the Bloody Flux. In the whole City are numbred no less than six Hundred <HI>Pagods,</HI> or I∣dol Temples, the Inhabitants amount∣ing to an Hundred and Sixty Thousand, besides Merchants and Strangers; the City, as indeed the whole Kingdom, being said to be very Populous. Not far from this Palace, there is a great Lake, with many small Islands therein, which are Inhabited by their Priests, which they call <HI>Raulini.</HI> There are also constantly a great number of Boats running up and down in it, but hin∣der'd from all Communication with the City by a Bank, so contriv'd, that should they be Besieg'd, and overpowr'd by their Enemies, so as to be constrain'd to yield the City to them, they could overwhelm both it and them in a whole Deluge of Water, by breaking down that Bank.</P>
<P>From this City, passing down that Branch of the River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orietan.</NOTE> which runs to∣wards the North, you come to <HI>Orie∣tan;</HI> the whole Course of the River be∣ing extreamly delightful, the Banks be∣ing cover'd with tall Trees always
<PB N="560" REF="293"/>
green and shady, which bending their Head towards the Water, make one continued Arbour, and defend the Tra∣vellers from the scortching Sun. And the variety of Apes or Peacocks flying or skipping from branch to branch, adds very much to the pleasure of the Passage. <HI>Orietan</HI> is a City of great Concourse of Merchants from most Countries of the <HI>East, Pegu, China, Ja∣pan, Malacca;</HI> and from <HI>Malabar</HI> West∣ward; and other parts of <HI>India.</HI> 'Tis govern'd by a Deputy appointed by the King at his Coronation, receiving a Crown from his Hand, and always enjoying the Title of King himself; this City being one of those Twelve, the Capitals of Twelve Provinces, sub∣ject to the Kingdom of <HI>Arracan;</HI> which are always govern'd by Crown'd Heads. Not far from this City arises the Mount of <HI>Maum,</HI> which imparts its Name to a Lake washing the Foot thereof; thither are sent all those that are Exil'd by the King, who causes strict Guards to be kept in all the Pas∣ses, and further to prevent the flight of the Criminals, cuts off their Heels. The Mountain is hardly passable for
<PB N="561" REF="293"/>
Travellers, being not only craggy and impervious, but so infested with wild Beasts, that it is a difficult thing to escape them.</P>
<P>From the Mountain of <HI>Maum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peroem.</NOTE> cros∣sing the Gulph you come to another City <HI>Peroem,</HI> which being situate near the Sea, and having a good capacious Har∣bour, is a Town of great Traffick. 'Tis likewise the Residence of a Governour, who exercises absolute Authority with∣in his Precincts, and keeps a Court an∣swerable to the Majesty of a King.</P>
<P><HI>Ramu</HI> is another City of equal Con∣dition with <HI>Peroem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramu.</NOTE> from which it is not many Days Journey distant, but he Way betwixt them very dangerous, whether by Land or by Water; The Sea being subject to sudden tempestu∣ous Storms, and that by Land lying cross the Mountains of <HI>Pre,</HI> which se∣parate <HI>Arracan</HI> from <HI>Pegu,</HI> as dangerous, by reason of the Wild Beasts, as the for∣mer. What is further taken notice of in there parts, is a Mountain called <HI>Pora,</HI> which in the Language of the Country signifies God, or an Idol; which Name it borrows from an Idol plac'd upon the very top thereof, sitting cross-legg'd
<PB N="562" REF="294"/>
upon a Pedestal, to which those Hea∣thens resort with great Devotion. By this place runs a large River, from which some Engineers would have perswaded the King to have cut a Chan∣nel as far as <HI>Arracan;</HI> but he absolute∣ly refus'd to hearken to the Proposal, because he thought he should thereby expose the place of his Residence to the Incursions of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> who might with Ease convey his Forces down such a Channel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dianga.</NOTE>The next Town of Note along a tem∣pestuous Coast, is the City of <HI>Dianga,</HI> or <HI>Diango,</HI> which seems to belong to the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala,</HI> but made by Fa∣ther <HI>Tosi</HI> a principal City of this. Indeed this City, as well as <HI>Chatigam,</HI> which was undoubtedly once a City of this Kingdom, and the Government there∣of commonly allotted to the King's se∣cond Son, has run the risque of Frontier Towns, frequently to change its Master, and to be sometimes in the Hands of one of the Neighbouring Princes, and sometimes in those of the other. The greatest part of its Inhabitants are <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> Fugitives, who live here, and injoy great Priviledges and Immunities
<PB N="563" REF="294"/>
granted by the King. The Fathers of St. <HI>Augustine</HI> have here likewise a firm Residence, with a good House, and very decent Church. Many of them likewise make their abode in two neigh∣bouring Villages, <HI>Arracale,</HI> and <HI>Angar∣racale.</HI></P>
<P>Other places along this Coast subje∣cted to this King, are <HI>Coromoria, Sedoa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sundiva.</NOTE> <HI>Zara,</HI> and Port <HI>Magaeni.</HI> To which let me add the Island of <HI>Sundiva,</HI> which is an Island in the Gulph of <HI>Bengala,</HI> scarce twenty Miles remov'd from the Conti∣nent of that Kingdom. 'Tis about an Hundred Miles in Compass, and affords such vast quantities of Salt, that it needs no other Commodities to give in Ex∣change for any of those of the Neigh∣bouring Countries, being able with it a∣lone, to lade two Hundred Vessels every Year. 'Tis so well fortifi'd by nature alone, without the Assistance of Art, that 'tis al∣most impossible to seize it without the consent of the Inhabitants; which made the <HI>Portugueses</HI> cast an Eye upon it, with intent to make it a Retreat for them∣selves. Accordingly in the Year 1602, they took it from the <HI>Moguls,</HI> who some time before had depriv'd its lawful
<PB N="564" REF="295"/>
Prince thereof; who, after they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, confirm'd their Title to it, by a free Grant of all his Right and Claim thereto. But they never quietly en∣joy'd it, first the Inhabitants molesting them; and when they were Defeated, the King of <HI>Arracan,</HI> fearing the growth of their strength in those parts, endea∣vour'd to dislodge them; and tho' at first he was constrain'd to raise the Siege, and to make an Agreement with them, yet in the Year 1603, they were com∣pell'd to yield it to him, and retire into <HI>Bacala,</HI> and other parts of the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Assaram, Tipora, Chacomas</NOTE>Upon the Northern parts of this King∣dom, lie the Cities of <HI>Assaram, Tipora,</HI> and <HI>Chacomas,</HI> all said to be the Capital Cities of so many Kingdoms, but all sub∣ject to this of <HI>Arracan.</HI> Indeed I take their Kings to be no more than Deputies, or Vice-Roys, and Governours of these Ci∣ties, plac'd there with the great vaunt∣ing Title of Kings, by the King of <HI>Ar∣racan;</HI> as we are assur'd of those Gover∣nours afore mention'd, and that there are no less than Twelve of the same Dig∣nity in his whole Dominions. Nor do I meet with any thing remark'd of any of
<PB N="565" REF="295"/>
them, but that being places upon the Frontiers, they are constantly provided of good Garrisons: Unless I may have leave to add what Mr. <HI>Tavernier</HI> has Recorded of three of the Subjects of <HI>Tipora,</HI> which he calls <HI>Tipra,</HI> that he found them such notable Topers, that they never gave out 'till they had drunk him dry; and at last when all his Wine was spent, seem'd to express a great deal of concern that they could have no more. He tells, 'tis true, further, that there is a Gold Mine in the Dominions of this Prince; but so very course that it is not fit to be exported; that the King ex∣acts no Subsidies of his Subjects, but ob∣liges the prime of his Nobility to work six Days in the Year in his Mines in lieu of them. There are besides, some Silk-works here, of which they make good Advantage.</P>
<P>Taking the Southern Stream from <HI>Ar∣racan,</HI> it conducts you to the City <HI>Doba∣zi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dobazi.</NOTE> which is a place of very great Traf∣fick, being a Port much frequented by Strangers. Thence continuing your Voyage along the Coast you arrive at <HI>Chudabe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chuda</NOTE> which being situate near the Sea, and having a commodious Port, is
<PB N="566" REF="296"/>
also a place much frequented by Stran∣gers.</P>
<P>Not far from hence lies Cape <HI>Nigraes,</HI> and by it the Island <HI>Munay,</HI> famous for the Religion of the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cape</HI> Nigraes.</NOTE> being filled with Pagods and Temples, one whereof is called <HI>Quiay Figrau,</HI> or, the <HI>The Temple of the God of the Atoms of the Sun,</HI> and a∣nother <HI>Quiay Doceo, the Temple of the God of the afflicted of the Earth;</HI> and especi∣ally for being the place of Residence for the chief of the <HI>Raulini,</HI> whom they sometimes call <HI>Xoxom Pungri.</HI> This <HI>Xox∣om Pungri</HI> is the chief of all the Eccle∣siasticks in the Kingdom, this Title im∣porting as much among them, as <HI>Pope</HI> at <HI>Rome;</HI> on him depend all Spiritual Causes, and he is had in so great vene∣ration, not only by the People, but even by the King himself, that he always places him at his Right Hand; and ne∣ver speaks to him without a profound Re∣verence. This Island is likewise spoke of by <HI>Ferd. Mendez Pinto,</HI> but as in the Dominions of the Emperour of <HI>Pegu.</HI> He tells us too that he happen'd to be in those parts at the Death of one of those great Men, whom he calls only the <HI>Roo∣lim</HI> of <HI>Munay,</HI> and sets down at length
<PB N="567" REF="296"/>
he Ceremonies of his Interment, with those of the Election and Inauguration of his Successor; which would be too te∣dious here to recite. Let it suffice that the King and all the Grandees of the Court, together with all the Ecclesia∣sticks, according to the Antient Custom of <HI>Pegu,</HI> were oblig'd to attend the Fu∣neral; the Expences of which, which were defraid by the King, amounted to an Hundred Thousand Ducats; besides the Garments which the King and No∣bility gave to Thirty Thousand Priests. See <HI>Ferd. Mendez Pinto,</HI> ch. 60, 61, 62.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Munay,</HI> and doubling the Cape <HI>Nigraes,</HI> you come to <HI>Siriam,</HI> which <HI>To∣si</HI> makes the last City of <HI>Arracan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Siriam.</NOTE> tho' o∣thers account it a City of <HI>Pegu.</HI> Howe∣ver they differ not in the Situation there∣of, all placing it upon the Borders of the two Empires. But Father <HI>Tosi</HI> adds, that it was thither the Emperour of <HI>Mogo</HI> re∣tir'd with his Victorious Army, laden with the Spoils of the City of <HI>Tangu,</HI> Sub∣ject to the King of <HI>Brama;</HI> where he found not only a vast Treasure, but the white <HI>Elephant,</HI> and the two <HI>Caneques</HI> be∣fore mention'd. The City of <HI>Siriam,</HI> is not at present in that Splendour and flou∣rishing
<PB N="568" REF="297"/>
Condition it has formerly been, having once been the Metropolis of a Kingdom, and the place of Residence for the King and Court; and encompass'd with very strong Walls, the Foot steps whereof remain to this Day. But the last King thereof, being in the Year 1567, besieg'd therein by the King of <HI>Pegu,</HI> with an Army of Fifteen Hundred Thou∣sand Men, and having sustain'd a tedious Siege, to the Destruction of no less than the third part of the Enemies Army, when he could no longer hold out, ra∣ther than fall into their Hands, destroy'd himself by Poison, leaving the City with all its Nobles and Treasury a Prey to the Conquerour, who Transported them to <HI>Pegu.</HI> From this place to <HI>Arracan,</HI> you may pass by Barges along a small River that runs between them.</P>
<P>In short, this Kingdom of <HI>Arracan,</HI> or Empire of <HI>Mogo,</HI> is said to comprehend twelve lesser Kingdoms, and twenty four Provinces, of which, besides those already mention'd, my Authors have not given me so much as their Names.</P>

Their Nostrils are large and open, their Eyes small, but Quick; their Ears reach down to their Shoulders, like the <HI>Malabars;</HI> and no Colour is so pleasing to them as a dark Purple.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Customs a¦bout the Sick.</NOTE>When they are sick, they make use of the Physician, but send for the <HI>Raulini,</HI> who are their Priests; who coming to them blow upon them with their Mouths, and repeat some certain Prayers over them; which, if it immediately effects not the
<PB N="571" REF="298"/>
Cure, (as you may believe it seldom does) then they make use of the oppor∣tunity of making their Advantage of the Patient. They tell him he must offer a Sacrifice to <HI>Chaor-Baos,</HI> i. e. the God of the four Winds; who, they perswade them is the Author of all Distempers. This Sacrifice they call <HI>Ca∣louco,</HI> consisting of fat Capons and Hens, Hoggs and other Creatures, according to the Abilities of the Sick Person; and must be repeated four times, to every Wind distinctly, if he does not recover before; upon all which the <HI>Raulini</HI>'s feast themselves, with a great deal of Jollity. But if all this does not avail to the driving away the Distemper, then must the Wife or nearest Relation of the infirm Person, make a solemn Vow to perform, if he recovers, another Ceremony, which they call a <HI>Talagno.</HI> The performance whereof is thus; the Person that makes the Vow, having pro∣vided a Convenient Chamber, and hanged it with the richest Tapestry, and erected an Idol upon an Altar at the end thereof, with other necessary Pre∣parations, upon the Day appointed, the Priests and Relations of the Sick, re∣pair
<PB N="572" REF="299"/>
to the place, and are entertain'd with most sumptuous Feasts for Eight Days together, all sorts of Musick at∣tending all the time. But what is the most absurd part thereof, the Person that makes the Vow, is oblig'd to dance as long as he is able to stand, and when his Legs will support him no longer, he must take hold of a piece of Cloath, fasten'd to a Beam for that purpose, and continue dancing 'till he has quite ex∣hausted his Spirits, and he drops down as a Dead Man in the place. Then is the Musick redoubl'd, and all the Spe∣ctators second it with their Rejoicings, and are ready to Envy him the happi∣ness he then Enjoys, supposing him all the while he lies in this Condition, to Converse with the Idol. This Exer∣cise he is bound to repeat as long as the Feasting continues; but if his weak∣ness will not permit, then must some near Relation succeed in his place; and if at last the Person recovers after the <HI>Talagno</HI> is compleated, he is carried to the Pagods, and anointed with Oils, and Odoriferous and costly Perfumes, from the Head to the Foot. But if not∣withstanding all these Sacrifices and
<PB N="573" REF="299"/>
Vows, the Sick Person die at last, the <HI>Raulini</HI> have another fetch, they tell them all these Sacrifices were well ac∣cepted by the Gods, and the Reason why they granted not the Sick a long∣er life, was, because they design'd him a greater Favour by taking him to them∣selves, and recompencing him in ano∣ther World.</P>
<P>Not less Superstitious and absurd are they in their manner of Interment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funerals.</NOTE> For the Dead Corps being brought into the middle of the House, the <HI>Raulini</HI> walk∣ing round about it, cant over certain Prayers, whilst others perfume the place with Incense; the greatest part of the Family in the mean time keeping strict Watch, and beating upon a broad piece of Brass. This they tell you they do, lest to the great Disgrace and Damage to the Party deceas'd, a <HI>Black Cat</HI> should pass over him, for then he would be constrain'd to return to life again with Ignominy, and be depriv'd of that hap∣piness they suppose him to Enjoy in a∣nother World. Before the Deceas'd be carried out of the House, they invite to a Banquet, a sort of People called <HI>Graii,</HI> of which if they are not at lei∣sure
<PB N="574" REF="300"/>
to accept, it causes a most doleful Lamentation among the Relations of the deceas'd, taking that for a certain Sign that his Soul is Condemn'd to Hell, which they call the <HI>House of Smoak.</HI> The Coffin is adorn'd accord∣ing to the Abilities of the Person, and being firmly perswaded of the Trans∣migration of Souls into other Bodies, they never fail to paint upon it the Fi∣gures of Horses, Elephants, Eagles, Cows, Lions, and the most noble Crea∣tures they can imagin, as it were to di∣rect the departed Soul to the best Lodg∣ing. Unless out of pure Humility, the deceas'd order before-hand, Rats and Frogs, and the vilest and most despi∣cable Animals to be drawn in their stead, as the most suitable Receptions for his polluted Soul. In this manner the Body is carried out into the Fields, and there burnt to Ashes, the <HI>Raulini</HI> kindling the Fire, and the Relations attending clad all in White, which is their Mourning Attire, except a black Hatband round their Heads.</P>

Those that are of ability, send Portions like∣wise to the publick Temples, which are built in the form of a Pyramid or Steeple, higher or lower, according to the Pleasure of the Founder. In the Winter time, they Cloath their Idols that they may not take cold, in hopes of a mighty Recompence for such an act of Charity to them. At a certain time of the Year, they celebrate a Fe∣stival, which they call <HI>Sansaporan,</HI> in commemoration of the Dead, wherein they make a solemn Procession in Ho∣nour

<P>THIS King, for the vastness of his Treasure, and strength for War, is as considerable as most of the Prin∣ces of the <HI>East,</HI> and within less than an Hundred Years space, has much inlarg'd his Dominions by his Conquests, as well in <HI>Pegu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jarric. l. 6. c. 29.</NOTE> as <HI>Bengala.</HI> But in his Wars against the <HI>Portuguese</HI> he was never successful, a Fleet of his, of no less than five hundred and Forty Sail, being defeated by them in the Year

1605. And not long after coming a∣gainst the Fort of <HI>Siriam</HI> with a Fleet of Twelve Hundred Sail, together with a Land Army of Thirty Thousand Men, with three Thousand five Hundred great and small Canon, he was thrice beat both by Land and Sea, and forc'd to retire.</P>
<P>The Government is chiefly in the hands of Twelve Princes, to whom he gives the Title of Kings, residing in his Principal Cities, in Twelve Mag∣nificent Palaces built for the King him∣self; in all which are great Seraglio's, the Governour being oblig'd Yearly to chuse Twelve Girls, born that year within their Precincts, who are brought up at the King's Charge, 'till they are twelve Years old, at which age being brought to his Court, he chuses by the smell of their Garments, in which they have been made to sweat, those whose Scent pleases him, disposing of the rest to the Gentlemen of his Court.</P>

Nor does he at this time omit the Administration of Justice, but hears Causes, and attends publick Business, as much as in his Palace. One Pretence for his Marine Progress, is to visit the Pagod of their Supream Deity, whom they call <HI>Quiay Poragray,</HI> and to whom the King daily sends a sumptuous Din∣ner.

In the Year 1690, one <HI>Brama,</HI> King hereof, by his Victo∣rious Arms extended its limits beyond those known to his Predecessors, sub∣duing the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> and reducing him to be Tributary to the Crown of <HI>Pegu.</HI> But this continued no longer than to the time of his immediate Suc∣cessour.</P>
<P>The Soil, being water'd with seve∣ral Rivers, one whereof arising from the Lake <HI>Chiamay,</HI> takes a Course of between four and five hundred Miles before it falls into the Sea, is very rich and fertile, abounding especially with Rice and good Pasturage for their Cat∣tle.

<P>But a great augmentation of the wealth of the Country, which, before a late De∣solation in its Wars against <HI>Arracan</HI> and <HI>Siam,</HI> was esteem'd as great as of any Kingdom in the <HI>East,</HI> are the Precious Stones, such as Rubies, Topazes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Precious Stones.</NOTE> Sa∣phirs, Amethists, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which the Inhabitants comprehend under one com∣mon Name of Rubies, and distinguish them only by their Colour, calling the Saphir the Blew; the Amethist the Violet; the Topaz the Yellow Ruby; and so of the rest. But that which pro∣perly obtains that Name, is a Jewel transparent, sparkling Red, and towards the extremities thereof, or near the sur∣face, something incling to the Violet of the Amethist.

The natural shape is generally Oval or Glo∣bular, being scarce ever found with Corners. Their Value, as that of the Diamonds, increases proportionably to their Weight, being weighed by <HI>Ratis,</HI> whereof one is reckon'd three Grains and a half, or seven eighths of a Caratt, and a Stone of this Weight has been fold for twenty Pagods; one of two <HI>Ratis,</HI> and one of eight, for eighty five Pagods; one of three <HI>Ratis,</HI> and one

But if the Stone exceed this Weight, and be clean and perfect, there is no certain value to be set upon it. Of the Vertue of this Stone, as well as the Diamond, 'tis pleasant to read the Conceits of some fanciful Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tavern. <HI>part</HI> 2. <HI>pag.</HI> 144.</NOTE> as that 'tis a Soveraign Antidote against Poison, either wore, or taken inwardly in Powder, and a great Preservative against the Plague; that it chears the Heart, expels Sor∣row, restrains Lust, drives away fright∣ful Dreams, lessens sleep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beot. <HI>l.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 14.</NOTE> inspirits the Blood, and incites to Anger; and, what is beyond all these, by its chang∣ing Colour, foretels approaching Dan∣gers or Calamities to him that wears it; and the more darken'd and ob∣scur'd it appears, the greater will be the Misfortune. To this purpose one <HI>Wolfgangus Gabelchoverus</HI> relates of him∣self, That travelling with a Wife, a Rubie set in a Ring, which he wore upon his Finger, chang'd colour seve∣ral

times, 'till at last it seem'd to have lost its splendour, and was turn'd al∣most quite black; whereupon he took it from his Finger, and laid it aside, his Mind presaging some great Evil hanging over the Head either of him∣self or Relations; which happen'd ac∣cordingly, for in a few Days, he tells us, his Wife fell sick and died; after whose Death, his Ruby immediately recover'd its Ancient Lustre and Beau∣ty. The Balace Ruby is suppos'd by some, to have taken its name from <HI>Pa∣latium,</HI> or Palace; because it is, as it were the Palace or Matrix, in which are form'd the true Rubies. Others think the Name is deriv'd from <HI>Bala,</HI> which in the <HI>Persian</HI> Language signifies high or topping, which a∣grees to the natural Form of the Stone, which is commonly oblong or pointed; the most probable Conjecture is that of <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</HI> that it is borrow'd from the Country, where they are found in the greatest Plenty, which he says is by the Inhabitants called <HI>Balaheia.</HI> Tho' I must confess, I could have wish'd he had given us some better hints, whereby to find out that Country.</P>

Their very Women seem to have lost all Natural Modesty, go∣ing almost quite Naked, with only a thin Covering about their Middles, so carelesly bound about them, as not to cover their shame. They tell us indeed, in excuse for it, they were injoin'd to go so by an ancient Queen of the Coun∣try; who to prevent a worse Vice in
<PB N="590" REF="308"/>
the Men, commanded them to use this means of stirring up and inflaming their Desires towards them. Their Habita∣tions are as slovenly as their Manners corrupt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tosi <HI>Vol.</HI> 2 <HI>pag.</HI> 69.</NOTE> making no Scruple to lodge in the same Room with their Hoggs; and as for their Diet they always take care to season it with <HI>Sidol,</HI> mention'd in the Description of <HI>Arracan,</HI> so nau∣seous and offensive, that none but them∣selves can endure so much as the smell thereof. Their Marriages are likewise loose and uncertain; for the Man, as it were buying his Wife, being oblig'd to pay a Dowry to her Parents; if af∣ter he has some time Enjoy'd her, he dislikes either her Person or Conditions, he has liberty of divorceing her, and remitting her back to her Relations. On the other side, if the Woman or her Friends dislike her Husband, they may take her away from him, repay∣ing only the Dowry he gave to them. When any Stranger comes to reside a∣mongst them, they offer him his choice of their Daughters, one of which he hires at a certain rate, according to the time of his stay, to cohabit with him; and at his departure, she returns again
<PB N="591" REF="308"/>
to her Parents, without the least dis∣grace. Nay, should the same stranger return again into the Country, tho she should be Married to another Man, her Husband is oblig'd to restore her to him for the time of his continuance there, and when he leaves the place, receive her again.</P>
<P>They are Superstitious to the highest Degree, and great Worshippers of the Devil, making, as the <HI>Manichees</HI> of old, two Authors of Beings; one the Author of all Good, which is God, and the o∣ther of all Evil, which is the Devil.</P>
<P>Upon this Principle they are as zea∣lous in the Worship of the Devil as of God, and use as much Art and Pains to obtain his Favour. When any sick∣ness, or other Calamity befalls them, their first Addresses are to him, mak∣ing Vows to him, if he will free them from their present Misery, and cease to afflict them for the future. Nor dare they omit the solemn Performance of these Vows, upon their Recovery. But chusing a Man, whom they call the <HI>Father of the Devil,</HI> as being one of the greatest of his Priests, and best under∣standing,
<PB N="592" REF="309"/>
or at least pretending to do so, what will be most acceptable to him, to direct them, make a great Feast, attended with Musick of all sorts, to pacifie and appease this incensed Ad∣versary. Many of them will run about the streets in the Morning, with one hand full of Rice, and a Torch in the other, crying aloud, <HI>They go to give the Devil his Breakfast, that he might not hurt them all that Day.</HI> Others, before they eat, throw part of what they have over their Shoulders to feed him. And with such a panick Fear are they struck at the thoughts of this <HI>Author of Evil,</HI> that they will run, as if they were re∣ally possest, from a Man in a Mask, lest he should prove a Devil come out of Hell to torment them. And at a place call'd <HI>Tavay,</HI> they have a Custom to replenish their Houses with Victuals, and then leave them for three Months, that the Devils may come and dwell in them, feeding upon what they have provided; and to be propitious to them all the rest of the Year.</P>
<P>They have an Order of Religious among them had in much esteem, who
<PB N="593" REF="309"/>
do frequently oppose this Diabolical Worship, but are not able to root out of the minds of the People, what their Fears have so deeply imprinted there. These Religious they call <HI>Telapoi,</HI> who are not unlike <HI>Mendicant Fryers,</HI> living upon the Alms of the People, and so highly venerated by them, that they would be glad to drink the Water wherein they wash their Hands. They are usually of the very dregs of the People, but assume to themselves great stare and Majesty, walking thro' the streets with a grave compos'd Counte∣nance and Gate, in long Robes girt with a leathern Girdle four Fingers broad, at which hangs a Bag in which they bestow what they get. Their Heads are always cover'd, but they suffer not a hair to grow on them, or any other part of their Bodies. Their Habitations are in the Woods, in little kind of Nests or Cages upon the Tops of the Trees, for fear of the Tygers that infest those Parts. Every New Moon, others say, every <HI>Monday,</HI> they preach to the People, calling them to∣gether by the sound of a Bell, or Ba∣son; and for the Subject of their Dis∣courses,
<PB N="594" REF="310"/>
they generally make use of some Precept of the Law of Nature, as <HI>not to steal, not to commit Adultery, not to bear false Witness,</HI> &amp;c. a strict performance whereof they think suffi∣cient to Salvation, however extrava∣gant they may be in matters of Opini∣on and Speculation. Nor do these lati∣tudinarian Principles fail of a very good effect, making them very Charitable, and Hospitable to Strangers; nor in the least displeas'd when any of their People embrace Christianity, and are baptis'd. When they die, they are most sumptuously interr'd at the Ex∣pence of the People, being burnt in a very costly Pile of the most precious Woods that can be got. Their Ashes they cast into the River, but the re∣mainder of their Bones they bury near the Hut where they liv'd.</P>
<P>In matters of Faith, besides that Manichean Principle before mention'd, they hold divers others, hardly con∣sistent with it; as an eternal Succession of Worlds, without Creation; and a multiplicity of Gods to govern them; as for Example, they say this present World is to be under the Government
<PB N="595" REF="310"/>
of Five several Gods, of which four are already pass'd; and now above two thousand two hundred Years e∣lapsed since the Death of the last of these; so that they expect suddenly the coming of the Fifth, after whose Decease, the World it self is to be de∣stroy'd by Fire, that a new one, Phae∣nix-like, may spring out of the Ashes. The Souls of Men, they say, after se∣veral Transmigrations, attain the Per∣fections and Felicity of their Gods; which is no other than a state of An∣nihilation. For first they pass thro' the Bodies of living Creatures, Beasts, and Birds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and they are receiv'd into a place they call <HI>Naxac, i. e. the place of Torments.</HI> Whence they being, after a long Confinement, set free, they are admitted into <HI>Sevum,</HI> a second re∣ceptacle for departed Souls; a place of all sorts of sensual Pleasures, and a true <HI>Mahometan</HI> Paradise. Having ac∣complish'd their time in this likewise, they arrive at their last and irrever∣sible state, which they call <HI>Nibam,</HI> which imports as much among them as a total Privation of the Essence both of Soul and Body, or a state of Annihi∣lation.
<PB N="596" REF="311"/>
But this is to be said for them, that they are not so wedded to any of these Opinions, as not to be willing e∣nough to hearken to, and embrace o∣ther Doctrines, when they are made known to them.</P>

before which the King, Queen, and their Children, present themselves in Triumphal Chariots. The Fourth is the Feast of Water, the King, Nobles, and all the People sporting themselves by throwing Water one upon another; and 'tis impossible to pass the Streets without being soundly wet. Lastly, the Fifth is celebrated only at <HI>Macao,</HI> but the King and whole Court are always there; and their greatest Recreation and Entertainment is to see the Courti∣sans in their Barks upon the Water; the Prize of the first being a Statue of Gold; to the second, one of Silver; and all the rest are expos'd to the Derision of the Spectators.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Pegu</HI> has been reckon'd by some Authors, next to the <HI>Great Mo∣gul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tosi, <HI>Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>Pag.</HI> 63.</NOTE> and the Emperour of <HI>China,</HI> one of the greatest Princes of the <HI>East.</HI> Espe∣cially during the Reign of <HI>Brama,</HI> who was able to bring an Army into the Field, consisting of above a Million and half of Men, and not arm above one in ten of his Subjects. And his Son lay Siege to <HI>Joudia</HI> the Capital City of <HI>Si∣am,</HI> with an Army of Nine Hundred Thousand Men; and had certainly ta∣ken

it, had not the besieg'd found means to <HI>drown the Country</HI> round about; which Inundation swept away all that vast Army, except Seventy Thousand Men, many that escap'd drowning being af∣terwards destroy'd by the <HI>Siameses,</HI> sal∣lying out upon them, shut in by the Water, in <HI>Barges;</HI> but the rest, after much hardship, without either Horses or Baggage, got back to <HI>Martaban.</HI> This Misfortune was follow'd by several o∣thers; for being incens'd by his Losses, he grew Cruel and Tyrannical against his own Subjects, provoking them thereby to Rebel against, or at least Revolt from him.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS Concerning the Nature of the <HI>SILK-WORMS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>India</HI> the <HI>Silk-Worms</HI> in <HI>Novem∣ber</HI> are in Eggs 12 Days. Or ac∣cording to the Natives Account, one <HI>Aggoa,</HI> from which the Silk then made, is called <HI>Aggoued-bund,</HI> and is the best that is made all the Year. After twelve Days from the first of <HI>November,</HI> the Worms are hatch'd, or come out of their Eggs, and are laid upon Matts.</P>
<P>The four first Days after they are laid upon Matts, they give them Mul∣berry Leaves, cut into small thin pieces, to feed upon Four times a Day, <HI>viz.</HI> Morning, Noon, and at 3 and 9 a Clock.</P>
<P><PB N="600" REF="317"/>The 5th Day they must not be fed at all.</P>
<P>The 6th day the Worms will be somewhat bigger, and must be fed with big pieces of Leaves, and that four times a Day, according to the times before mention'd.</P>
<P>The 7th, 8th, 9th, feed them as on the 6th day.</P>
<P>The 10th Day they must not be fed at all.</P>
<P>The 11th Day they must be fed with larger pieces of Leaves, and four times a day, as formerly.</P>
<P>The 12th day they are to be fed with whole Leaves, and four times a Day.</P>
<P>The 13th and 14th they must not be fed at all.</P>
<P>The 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, they must be fed with whole Leaves, and four times a day.</P>
<P>The 19th Day, feed them five times, <HI>viz.</HI> Morning, Noon, at 3, and 9 a Clock, and at Mid-night, and con∣tinue to feed them so to the 26th in∣clusive.</P>
<P><PB N="601" REF="317"/>The Worms from about the 14th day, will begin to be green, and at the 26th day will be about 2¼ Inches long.</P>
<P>The 17th day they will be of a Co∣lour like Yellow and White, and then you must not feed them any more, because they begin to spin.</P>
<P>The 28th day, they must be put upon Ledges of Matt, fasten'd to a large piece of round Matting, the Led∣ges being about an Inch high from the Mat, and running round like a Screw, beginning at the Center of the Mat, and running round at about a hand∣ful or three Inches distance to the Cir∣cumference. When the Worms are put upon those Ledges, they set the Mats leaning in the Sun, about 8 in the Morning, and let them stand for 1½ Hour; then they put them into the House or Shade, leaning against the Wall; after, at 4 a Clock in the After∣noon, they put them again into the Sun, and let them stand 'till Sun-Set; then they put them in the House or Shade, leaning against a Wall, and in this Day and Night's time, they will have made their Houses.</P>
<P><PB N="602" REF="318"/>The 29th Day they take the Worms with their new Silk Houses, and put them upon other Mats, flat, without any Ledges or Partitions, and so lay several Mats upon Frames one over another.</P>
<P>The 30, 31, 32, and 33 days, they spin within their Houses of Silk, and then they take each Worm with its House, and shake it at their Ears, and those that are alive, they are good, and fit for Breeders, which are kept for such, and those that make no noise are dead, having spun away their Life. Sometimes ⅛ ¼ 1/16 live; sometimes more, and sometimes less; for great Heats and Colds kill many.</P>
<P>The 34, 35, 36, 37th days, they con∣tinue spinning.</P>
<P>The 38th day the Worms eat thro' their Houses, and are like a Butterfly; after which they take up their Houses, and put the Worms upon new Mats; the Males they know by their slender∣ness, and the Females by the contra∣ry, which, being plac'd near each o∣ther, join; but if there be more of one sort than the other, then after they have done with the lesser number, ei∣ther

Males or Females, they join them with the rest, and let them lie all Night.</P>
<P>The 39th day they throw away the Males.</P>
<P>The 40th the Females lay their Eggs, after which they throw them away likewise. So that the whole Life of these Worms, is but 12 days in the Egg, and 40 days out of it; in all 52 Days.</P>
<P>The next Silk is made in <HI>January;</HI> and then the Worms are fourteen days in the Egg, and 40 afterwards before they die. This Silk is called <HI>Maug-Bund,</HI> and is the Sixth, and worst sort of Silk. The making of it ends about <HI>February</HI> the 14th.</P>
<P>The next is made from <HI>February</HI> the 14th to the 24th of <HI>March,</HI> and is cal∣led <HI>Cheita-bund.</HI> The Worms stay in the Eggs 8 days, and live 32 days af∣ter. This is esteem'd the second sort for goodness.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Sauk-Bund,</HI> esteem'd the fifth sort for Goodness. The Worms stay in their Eggs 8 days, and live 32 days after. The making of this Silk ends about the 6th of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="604" REF="320"/>The next is <HI>Assoree-Bund,</HI> esteem'd the 4th sort for Goodness. The Worms continue in the Eggs and die, as the two last sorts. And the making of the Silk ends about the 4th of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>The next is <HI>Sowaud-Bund,</HI> and is e∣steem'd the third sort. The making of this also ends about the last of <HI>Ju∣ly.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September</HI> no Silk is made, and but very little in <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Nature of the <HI>Silk-worms</HI> in the <HI>Indies</HI> where the Heat of the Sun renders them much more fruitful than with us; for in <HI>India</HI> the Worms breed and spin their Silk six times in the Year, and in <HI>England</HI> only once, be∣cause here they remain in the Egg from the latter end of <HI>August,</HI> 'till a∣bout the latter end of <HI>May.</HI> There likewise they are sooner brought to per∣fection, and begin to work sooner, <HI>viz.</HI> 28 days after they are hatcht, but in <HI>England</HI> not 'till the 40th. Where also they are by a third part more tedious in breaking out of their Houses, from the first day of their Spinning, than they are in the <HI>East,</HI> which is there done in ten days, but here only in fif∣teen.</P>
<P><PB N="605" REF="320"/>The Silk-worm derives its Birth from the Seed of the Butterfly, which is as small as the Heads of Pins, and does somewhat resemble Rape-Seed, being flatted on both sides. This In∣sect, by whose Industry we have the Silk, which is spun out of its Bowels, and artificially form'd by its Mouth into the Fashion of a Clew, differs not very much from a Caterpillar, either in the Shape or Bulk, baiting that this is more Hairy, and its Web is weaker, and of another Colour. And yet for want of Mulberry-Leaves (which is the most proper Food for the Silk-Worm) when they are forc'd to sub∣sist by the Leaves of the Rose-Bush, Lettice, or some others (which some∣times are made use of) this Nourish∣ment either weakens the Thread they Spin, and makes it as useless as that of the Caterpillars, or else they will not work at all. But that which seems most remarkable and wonderful in this Animal, is its change of shape, and one would think of Species, in the transformation of it from a Reptile to a Volatile, from a creeping Worm into a Butterfly. The Grain or Seed

of these Creatures was transported in∣to <HI>Italy,</HI> above three hundred Years a∣go, by two Religious Persons, but their Silk was of a longer Date, and brought above a Thousand Years since among the <HI>Europeans,</HI> who cal∣led it in Latin, <HI>Sericum,</HI> from an O∣riental People, called <HI>Seres,</HI> who were very industrious and careful in its Improvement.</P>
