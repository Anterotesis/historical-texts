<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE now most Illustri∣ous
Princes <HI>Ivan</HI> and <HI>Pe∣ter
Alexievits,</HI> Great
Lords, Emperors, Grand
Dukes, and Conserva∣tors
of all the <HI>Great,</HI> and

Dukes of <HI>Novogorod</HI> in the Lower
Countries; of <HI>Rosansko, Rostessko, Ge∣restessko,

Lords of the Country of <HI>Versco,</HI> of <HI>Car∣talinsko,</HI>

Country of <HI>Cabardinsco;</HI> Czars and Dukes
of <HI>Circasco,</HI> and <HI>Igorsco,</HI> Lords and Mo∣narchs
of several other Dominions and
Provinces, East, West, and North;
which are their Inheritance from Father
to Son: These, I say, my most gracious
Lords and Princes, having after mature
deliberation resolved to send a most splen∣did
Embassy to the Great <HI>Amologdachan</HI>
(or Emperor of <HI>China); Everrard Isbrand,</HI>
a Native of <HI>Germany,</HI> born in the City
of <HI>Gluckstad,</HI> in the Dukedom of <HI>Holstein,</HI>
was pitch'd upon by the abovementioned
Two <HI>Czars,</HI> as a fit Subject to discharge
so great a Trust; and being accordingly
declared their Ambassador to the Great
<HI>Amologdachan,</HI> he gratefully accepted of
the Favour bestowed upon him by both
their <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesties; and after his
humble Thanks for the Grace received
from their hands in putting so much con∣fidence
in him, he ordered his Equipage,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
and all other matters requisite for so great
a Journey, to be got in readiness to depart
at a minutes warning.</P>
<P>After some time spent in providing se∣veral
rich Presents, which we were to
carry along with us into <HI>China,</HI> and all
other necessaries; the Ambassador and
the chiefest of his Retinue were in the
Year 1692, the 3<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>March,</HI> introdu∣ced
into the presence of <HI>Ivan Alexievits,</HI>
to Kiss his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's hands; and
on the 12<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI> following, having
been admitted into the presence of <HI>Peter
Alexievits,</HI> the Youngest of the Two
<HI>Czars,</HI> to receive the same Honour from
his Hands after his return to <HI>Musco</HI> from
<HI>Peresla,</HI> we set out on our Journey the next
following day, being the 13<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Attendance of the Ambas∣sador
at his departure from <HI>Musco,</HI> con∣sisted
only in One and twenty Persons;
among whom were Twelve <HI>Germans,</HI>
the rest <HI>Muscovites.</HI> We were provided
with a good Chest of Physick, a Physici∣an,
and a good number of Baggage-Wag∣gons
to carry our Provisions, Wines, and
all other Necessaries for so great a Journey;
and having taken our leave, not without
some tears, of our Friends, both <HI>Germans</HI>
and <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who conducted us for
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
some Miles out the Town, we conti∣nued
our Journy towards <HI>Troitza.</HI></P>
<P>But before I go any further in giving
an account of this Embassy, I hope it will
not be look'd upon in me as a presumption,
if by way of digression, I touch upon
some general matters concerning <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
which being otherwise known by the
name of the <HI>Great</HI> or <HI>Black Russia,</HI> ex∣tends
its Frontiers to the utmost Borders of
<HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI> It is of a vast extent,
its length reaching from the Confines of
<HI>Poland</HI> as far as to the great <HI>Asiatick Tar∣tary,</HI>
and its breadth from the <HI>Frozen Sea</HI>
to the <HI>Caspian Lake</HI> or <HI>Sea;</HI> but many of
its Provinces (especially those bordering
upon <HI>Asia</HI>) are almost desolate.</P>
<P>Among many others, it has Four great
and famous Rivers; the first is the River
<HI>Wolga,</HI> arising not far from the Confines
of <HI>Poland,</HI> and exonerating it self in
the <HI>Caspian Sea.</HI> The second is the River
<HI>Oby,</HI> which disimbogues in the <HI>Frozen
Sea;</HI> and on that side divides <HI>Asia</HI> from
<HI>Europe.</HI> The third the River <HI>Don,</HI> which
discharges it self in the <HI>Euxine Sea.</HI> And
the fourth the River <HI>Dwina,</HI> which falls
near <HI>Archangel</HI> into the <HI>White Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Musco,</HI> besides its anti∣quity,
has this to boast of, that ever since
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
the Year 1540. at what time <HI>Czar Ivan
Basilovits</HI> began his Reign, it has been
the constant Residence of the succeeding
<HI>Czars,</HI> to wit, of <HI>Fedor Ivanovits, Boris
Goudenou, Fedor Berisovits,</HI> of the Coun∣terfeit
<HI>Demetrius Ivanovits,</HI> of <HI>Basili Iva∣novits
Zusksi, Michael Federovits, Alexoi
Michaelovits, Ivan Alexiovits.</HI> and of the
present <HI>Czar Peter Alexiovits.</HI> It is near
Fifteen <HI>English</HI> Miles in compass, being
scituate on the River <HI>Mosco</HI> (which not
far from thence joins its current with the
River <HI>Occa,</HI> and falls afterwards into the
great River <HI>Wolga</HI>) in the Center of
<HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>The Castle, called <HI>Cremelina,</HI> where the
<HI>Czars</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> keep their ordinary
Residence, is Fortified with a very strong
Wall, a deep Ditch, and some Demilunes,
upon which are mounted good store of
large Cannon.</P>
<P><HI>Russia</HI> has its own Patriarch, who exer∣cises
the same Authority all over the <HI>Mus∣covian</HI>
Empire, as the Pope does in other
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Countries. But for the
conveniency of Commerce, the <HI>Lutherans,</HI>
as well as other Protestants, are allow'd
the free exercise of their Religion in the
City of <HI>Musco,</HI> as well as in some other
places of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> The <HI>Lutherans</HI> are
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
very confiderable for their Number in the
Capital City, where they have Two
Churches built of Stone in the <HI>German</HI> Sub∣urbs.
The <HI>Calvinists</HI> have also one very fine∣ly
built in the same place. The <HI>Roman Ca∣tholicks</HI>
and <HI>Iews,</HI> who have not been to∣lerated
till of late, only exercise their de∣votion
in a private house, and the Jesuits
are excluded from that benefit also, under
pain of Banishment, as it happened to one
of that Fraternity not many years ago.</P>
<P>It is very well worth taking notice
here, That the present <HI>Czar Peter</HI> is a
Prince of an excellent good Humour, and
a great Favourer of the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> whom
he presented with all the Stone Materials
which were made use of in building their
new Church, and gave them permission,
without the approbation of the Patriarch,
to adorn their Church with a Steeple.</P>
<P>But to return to our Journey; We Tra∣velled
the 14<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI> to <HI>Troitza,</HI> a
place very agreeable both for its Scituation
and the Fertility of the circumjacent
Country. This place is chiefly famous
for the Convent of <HI>Troitza;</HI> which by
reason of its strong Fortifications resem∣bles
a great Castle at a distance, being
scituate about 60 <HI>Versts</HI> or <HI>English</HI> Miles
from <HI>Musco.</HI> The present <HI>Czar Peter</HI> is
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
so extreamly taken with the delightfulness
of this place, that scarce a Week passes
but he diverts himself there.</P>
<P>After we had passed here one Day and
two Nights to refresh our Horses, and to
take a full view of the place, we Tra∣velled
the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI> as far as <HI>Pereslaw,</HI>
a great and magnificent City, according
to the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Fashion, the Houses be∣ing
all of Wood. It is scituate on a Lake
about 60 <HI>Versts</HI> or Miles from <HI>Troitza,</HI> near
it are fine Saltpits, which afford great
store of very white Salt, which is from
thence transported to other places.</P>
<P>From hence we pursued our Journy to
the City of <HI>Rostof,</HI> having a Convent of
the same name; it is the Capital of the
Province of the same name, which in
former Ages was, next to <HI>Novogored Ve∣tiki,</HI>
accounted one of the most ancient
and most considerable of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and
afterwards was appropriated as an Ap∣penage
to the use of the Younger Brothers
of the Imperial Family; but the last
Prince of that Race being in the Year
1565, by the Tyrant <HI>Ivan Basilovits</HI> be∣reav'd
at once of his Dominions and Life,
the same was reincorporated with the
Crown of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Rostof</HI> it self is a very large
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
and stately City, scituate on a Lake; from
whence arises the River <HI>Coterius,</HI> which
discharges it self into the River <HI>Wolga;</HI>
it is dignified with the Title of an Arch∣bishoprick,
and the Archbishop keeps his
Residence in the Castle, which is Built of
Wood; it is 60 <HI>Versts</HI> distant from <HI>Pereslaw.</HI></P>
<P>We did not tarry long here, being afraid
to lose the conveniency of making use of
our Sleds, by reason of the approaching
Spring; for which reason having provided
our selves with fresh Horses, we came on
the 18<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI> to <HI>Iaroslaw,</HI> the Capital
of the Province, scituate near the River
<HI>Wolga,</HI> and one of the largest Cities of the
whole <HI>Russian</HI> Empire. It is a place of vast
Traffick, but especially celebrated for its
Trade in <HI>Muscovia</HI>-Leather; of which
such prodigious quantities are dressed in
this place, that it furnishes not only <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
but also a great part of <HI>Europe</HI> with
this Commodity.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Iaroslaw</HI> is of a very
large extent, and extremely fertile, espe∣cially
where it borders upon the River
<HI>Wolga.</HI> This Province, like the former,
was allotted as an Appenage to the
Younger House of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> who en∣joyed
it for a considerable time, with the
Title of Princes, till being also subdued
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
by the aforementioned Tyrant <HI>Ivan Basi∣lovits,</HI>
they were forced to rest contented
with a certain yearly Allowance under the
Jurisdiction of the <HI>Czars</HI> of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>We were forced to stay here the 19<SUP>th</SUP>
of <HI>March,</HI> partly to take a little Rest,
partly to expect the Coming of our Bag∣gage.
The 20<SUP>th</SUP> we again set forward
in our Journey, and arrived at Mid-night
in the City of <HI>Wologda,</HI> situate upon the
River of the same Name, about 180
Versts or Miles from <HI>Iaroslaw.</HI> All the
Country betwixt this City and that of
<HI>Musco</HI> is extreamly populous, we seldom
Travelling a Day but within sight of 14
or 15 Villages or Towns.</P>
<P>This City is the Capital of the Province
of the same Name, which is almost impas∣sable
at some times of the Year, by reason
of the many Forests and Boggs: It for∣merly
was under the Jurisdiction of the
Dukes of <HI>Novogorod Veliki;</HI> but since the
Peace concluded in the Year 1613, be∣twixt
the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Muscovites;</HI> by ver∣tue
of which, the last were put in possessi∣on
of the Dukedom of <HI>Novogorod Veliki,</HI>
that of <HI>Wologda,</HI> as being its dependency,
also devolved unto the <HI>Muscovites.</HI> It is
a pretty large City; but what is most re∣markable
is its Castle, which by the in∣defatigable
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
Care of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> is sur∣rounded
with so strong a Fortification of
Stone, as to be accounted impregnable.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Wologda,</HI> which has com∣municated
its Name both to the City
and Province, runs from West to North,
till it joins its Current with the River
<HI>Dwina.</HI></P>
<P>On the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Day of <HI>March</HI> (as good for∣tune
would have it) the Weather turn'd
again to a hard Frost, to our great Satis∣faction;
for without it we must have
quitted our Sleds, and must have stay'd
there till the Frost had been quite broke,
which in all probability would have
stopp'd our Journey for several Months.
We therefore pursued our Journey the
22<SUP>d</SUP>, and on the 23<SUP>d</SUP> came to <HI>Scuskajam;</HI>
where being provided with fresh Horses,
we, after Dinner was over, went forward
upon the River of <HI>Sucagna.</HI> On the 24<SUP>th</SUP>
of <HI>March</HI> we again changed our Horses
in a small Place called <HI>Tettma;</HI> which
having nothing in it to stay us in our
Journey, we Travelled on with all the
Expedition imaginable, in hopes to take
up our next nights Quarters in the Village
of <HI>Vsgorodishna;</HI> but meeting beyond Ex∣pectation
there with more fresh Horses;
and being willing to improve our Time
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
to the best advantage, we Travelled on
the same Night; and the following Day,
being the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March,</HI> to the Village of
<HI>Bobroffskajam,</HI> where indeed we refresh'd
our selves a little; but having again the
good fortune to find new Horses ready
for us, we set forward the same Night;
and the next following, being the 27<SUP>th</SUP> of
<HI>March,</HI> and the first <HI>Easter</HI> Holiday, arri∣ved
in the Capital City of the Province
of <HI>Vstiugha;</HI> where we spent that day and
the following night in affording our selves
necessary Rest, and such other good Cheer
as we thought most convenient to restore
our decayed Spirits.</P>
<P>Scarce had we taken a few hours Rest
to recover our selves from the past Fa∣tigues,
but the Governor of the Place sent
one of his Servants; who after a Compli∣ment
from his Master, offered us in his
Name every thing that might be in his
Power to serve us; and I must confess,
that we were not only very handsomely
entertain'd here, but also furnish'd with
every thing that was thought convenient
for the prosecution of our Journey.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Vstiugha,</HI> as well as its
Castle, is situate upon the very Bank of
the River <HI>Sucagna,</HI> being a very populous
and well-built City; its chief Traffick
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
consists in all sorts of Furrs and Skins, but
especially in white Fox-Skins.</P>
<P>We Travelled all the way from <HI>Schus∣kajam</HI>
to <HI>Vstiugha,</HI> upon the River <HI>Sucag∣na,</HI>
not without great Danger, the Ice
being almost melted by the Beams of the
approaching Sun: This is the same River
by which the Merchants of <HI>Wologda</HI> tra∣vel
to <HI>Archangel.</HI></P>
<P>Being again provided here with fresh
Horses, we came on the 29<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI>
to a small Place called <HI>Lolowitzgoth,</HI> up∣on
the River of <HI>Wictzegda:</HI> This River
joining its Current with the River <HI>Dwina,</HI>
is very well known to the <HI>Russian</HI> Mer∣chants,
who from this Place travel in six
or seven Nights to <HI>Archangel,</HI></P>
<P>For the rest, this Place having nothing
in it, which was inviting enough to de∣tain
us there; and meeting with fresh
Horses, we travell'd the same day near
50 Miles through a very large Forest,
which is accounted by the Inhabitants
to contain 800 Miles in length.</P>
<P>It is in sundry places inhabited by a
certain People called <HI>Sirenes,</HI> who tho'
quite different from the <HI>Muscovites</HI> in their
Language and Manners, yet profess the
<HI>Greek</HI> Religion, and are therefore in great
Esteem among the <HI>Russians.</HI> Where-ever
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
we came we had our share in the publick
Rejoicings, which are made, during the
<HI>Easter</HI>-time, all over <HI>Muscovy,</HI> in remem∣brance
of the Resurrection of Christ; it
being an ancient Custom in <HI>Russia</HI> to pre∣sent
one another not only on <HI>Easter</HI>-day,
but for 14 days after, with painted Eggs,
of which you see great Quantities ready
boil'd, to be sold on all the Corners of the
Streets, no body, of what Quality, Degree,
Age or Sex, daring to refuse either the
Eggs or the Kiss, which is always given
as you present the Eggs. If they meet in
the Streets, they salute one another in
these Words, <HI>Christo vos chrest;</HI> that is,
Christ is risen: whereto the other having
answered, <HI>Wo is tenoros Chrest;</HI> that is, he
is certainly risen, they Kiss one another.
This Custom is so general, that if during
this time you are invited at a <HI>Russian</HI>'s
House to partake of their Merriments,
and you should not offer to kiss the Ladies
there present, (where it is to be observed
that you must take care not to touch them
with your hands) you would be look'd
upon as an ill bred Clown; whereas if
you acquit your self handsomely in this
Point, you are sure to receive a Cup of
<HI>Aquavitae</HI> in return for your Civility.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="12"/>
But to return to our Journey, which
for some days after proved very trouble∣some
to us, being obliged to cut down
many Trees, to facilitate our Passage
through the Forest: Besides which, the
many Rivers (amongst which the <HI>Siasellae,
Chasim,</HI> and <HI>Nactim Peris,</HI> were the chiefest)
we were to pass, rendered our Passage not
only difficult, but very dangerous, many
of our Men and Sleds falling into the last
of these Rivers by the breaking of the
Ice; but, by the help of the rest, having
happily escaped the danger, we were ob∣liged
to take new Measures for the fu∣ture.</P>
<P>For which reason, when we came to
any of these Rivulets, which coming from
the adjacent Hills, run through the Val∣leys,
we fastned many pieces of Timber
together, over which (in the nature of a
Bridge of Boats) we drew our Sleds by
the help of strong Ropes, whilst we were
forced to walk it on Foot, and to let our
Horses swim through the Rivers; We
had at last the good fortune to surmount
all these Obstacles, without any great
Damage or Loss; but being extreamly
fatigued by so troublesome a Passage, we
rested our selves for some time in a Vil∣lage.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="12"/>
Having a little recovered our selves, we
continued our Journey, and arrived safely
on the 6<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April</HI> at <HI>Kaigorod,</HI> upon the
River <HI>Kama.</HI> This Place has its own
Governor, and a good Garison, who keep
a watchful Eye over the Inhabitants, who
are <HI>Sirenes;</HI> besides, that the <HI>Cosacks</HI> some∣times
pay them a Visit when they least ex∣pect
it.</P>
<P>Of this the Governor of the Place, <HI>Ivan
Mikietivits Lopugin,</HI> related us an Instance
which had hapned two Years before, in
the Year 1690, being the first of his Go∣vernment.
It seems thirty of these <HI>Cosacks</HI>
having had intelligence that the Place was
at that time not sufficiently provided for
its Defence, had taken a Resolution to at∣tack
it on the Water-side: For which pur∣pose,
having provided themselves with all
necessary Arms, and, among the rest, with
one great Piece of Cannon, they took the
opportunity of the Night, when every
body enjoying the benefit of Rest, they
surprized the Town, murthered and plun∣dered
all that came in their way, and were
within an Inch of having seized the Go∣vernor;
who happily escaping their hands,
caused the Alarum to be given to the In∣habitants;
who being thereby made sen∣sible
of the Danger, run to their Arms,
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
and soon obliged these Vagabonds to be∣take
themselves to flight. They pursued
them for some time upon the River; but
the darkness of the Night covering their
Retreat, they escaped with the greatest
part of the Booty.</P>
<P>Our Sleds being now become quite use∣less
to us, we were obliged to tarry here
till such time that the Ice were sunk in the
River: In the mean while we diverted
our selves with Hunting, and such other
Pastimes as the Place and our present Cir∣cumstances
would afford. For we had
not been here many days, when we were
frightned with a new Report, That a con∣siderable
Number of these Robbers had
again associated together in order to come
and surprize our Baggage, which put us
under no small Consternation, till the
Governor having order'd us a good Guard,
and disposed the Garison so as to be ready
upon all occasions, we were soon freed
from these Apprehensions, and passed the
rest of our time in our usual divertise∣ments.</P>
<P>The River being by this time cleared
of the Ice, we took our Leave of the Go∣vernor,
and embark'd in a Vessel built for
that purpose, on the 23<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>April,</HI> upon
the River <HI>Kama;</HI> in our Passage we saw
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
several Monasteries on both sides of the
River, but very few Villages.</P>
<P>The large River <HI>Kama</HI> comes from
the North-East, and with a swift Current
runs as far as <HI>Casan,</HI> where it exonerates
it self on the left side of it into the River
<HI>Wolga.</HI> It approaches in Bigness to the
River <HI>Weser</HI> in <HI>Germany.</HI> It is increased
by several lesser Rivers, among which is
the River <HI>Wiesetzca,</HI> which falls into it
about 25 Miles from <HI>Solokamsko.</HI></P>
<P>We left the River <HI>Kama</HI> on the 26<SUP>th</SUP>
of <HI>April,</HI> towards Evening, directing our
Course to the Left, to the small River
<HI>Vsolsko,</HI> from whence we had 7 Miles to
travel to <HI>Solokamsko:</HI> But going against
the Stream, we came not till the 27<SUP>th</SUP> to
<HI>Solokamsko,</HI> being a Place situate in a very
pleasant Plain upon the River <HI>Vsolsko,</HI>
built there on purpose by the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
for the conveniency of such, as have oc∣casion
to travel into those far distant Pla∣ces.
It is inhabited both by <HI>Russians</HI> and
<HI>Tartars,</HI> who trade in all sorts of Cattle,
but especially in Horses; which being ve∣ry
excellent hereabouts, are preferred be∣fore
others all over <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>There being constantly fourscore Cop∣pers
employed here in making of Salt,
this makes this Place, as well as the adja∣cent
<PB N="18" REF="14"/>
Villages, (where they follow the same
Employment) very considerable, it being
very fine, and from hence transported to
<HI>Casan.</HI></P>
<P>On the 29<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April</HI> we had the mis∣fortune
to have one of the Ambassador's
Attendance to fall over-board, and to be
drowned: He was a <HI>Muscovite</HI> by Birth,
his Name being <HI>Simon Callaction,</HI> for the
rest a good honest fellow; but being
overcome by the strength of <HI>Aquavitae,</HI>
came by this Accident, by tumbling over∣board,
and was, notwithstanding all the
care taken by his Comrades to save his
life, carried away by the swiftness of the
Current: His Body was found floating
on the first of <HI>May,</HI> when it was interr'd
near the Shoar.</P>
<P>On the second of <HI>May</HI> the Ambassador,
with most of his Retinue, were invited
by a certain <HI>Muscovian</HI> Gentleman, one
of the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Factors, whose Name was
<HI>Alexi Astaffi Philatoff,</HI> to his Country∣house,
about 20 Miles distant from <HI>Solok,</HI>
where we were entertained with a very
handsome Dinner, and pass'd the Day
very merrily. Near this place his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty employs above 20000 Workmen
in making of Salt. The Gentleman whom
we mention'd before, had, at his own cost,
<PB N="19" REF="14"/>
two large Vessels built in this place, of
400 Tuns each, for the Transportation of
Salt; and hearing of our coming that
way, had caused them to stay for some
time, to make us eye-witnesses of the man∣ner
of convoying these Ships, and what Or∣der
and Discipline there was observed a∣mong
them. Each of these Vessels had
500 Men on board, who were to labour
without intermission at the Oars, relieving
each other at certain and convenient times,
under the Command of several Officers;
so that by the continual supply of fresh
Men, these Vessels could perform a great
Voyage in a little time. Both these Ves∣sels
being loaden with nothing but Salt,
were bound to <HI>Casan,</HI> where they sold it
to a great Advantage: For whereas the
<HI>Pode</HI> (being 40 Pound weight) did not
stand the Owner in above half a <HI>Copeck</HI>
upon the Spot, it was sold at <HI>Casan</HI> for
twelve or thirteen <HI>Copecks.</HI></P>
<P>The night, betwixt the 3<SUP>d</SUP> and 4<SUP>th</SUP>
of <HI>May,</HI> it began to Snow and Freeze so
hard again, as if it had been in the Win∣ter;
which continuing till the 6<SUP>th</SUP>, put us
to no small trouble, being obliged to stay
here seventeen Days, which however we
passed pleasantly enough. The worst of
all was, that by the melting of the Snow,
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
and the overflowing of the Rivers, we
were disappointed in our design of going
by Land to <HI>Wergaturia,</HI> situate upon the
Frontiers of <HI>Siberia;</HI> which being but a
small Place, and furnished with very low
and indifferent Buildings, notwithstand∣ing
this has its own <HI>Waywode</HI> or Gover∣nor.
But, as I said before, being disap∣pointed
in our design, we were forced to
make use of five Boats, each of them
Mann'd with five Watermen, who, by the
help of their Oars, brought us on the 14<SUP>th</SUP>
of <HI>May</HI> as far as <HI>Vskogorod;</HI> but the Wind
veering about as we were within sight of
the Place, drove us back down the River
<HI>Vsolka,</HI> into the River <HI>Kama.</HI> They count
it 50 <HI>German</HI> Miles from <HI>Solokamsko</HI> to
<HI>Wergaturia.</HI> On the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May</HI> we entred
the small River <HI>Susora.</HI> From <HI>Solokamsko</HI>
to this River it is counted 30, and from
hence to <HI>Vlko</HI> 40 Miles. Here we were
again in no small Danger; for the Ri∣ver
having overflowen all the circum∣jacent
Country, just as we pass'd upon it,
to such an extraordinary a degree, that
our Boats often pass'd over the tops of the
Trees; if there had happened a sudden
Fall of the Waters, we must have infalli∣bly
perish'd; but we happily escaped the
Danger, and arrived safely on the 19<SUP>th</SUP> of
<PB N="21" REF="15"/>
<HI>May</HI> in a small City called <HI>Niesna Susowa,</HI>
where we refresh'd our selves. On the
20<SUP>th</SUP> we came to another small Town,
the Inhabitants of both are employed in
making of Salt. From hence upwards
the River, the pleasant Woods and Hills
on both sides afford a very delightful Pro∣spect.</P>
<P>In these Forests you meet with the
<HI>Agarius</HI> Tree, whose spongeous substance
is from hence carried to <HI>Archangel,</HI> and
from thence into other Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI>
We saw several Villages on both sides of
the River; and on the 25<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May</HI> took
up our Lodgings in one of them, situate
upon the very Banks of it. After we had
a little recovered our selves from our past
fatigues, we had the curiosity to enquire
into the Manners and Customs of the Peo∣ple
inhabiting those Parts.</P>
<P>They are called <HI>Wogultzoi,</HI> Subjects to
the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and are all <HI>Pagans,</HI>
much addicted to Superstition. Their
Stature is low and mean, not unlike the
<HI>Tartars;</HI> their Habitations having also a
great Resemblance to the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Huts,
but they are never without a Chimney
in them; They use a Language different
both from the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="16"/>
They being asked concerning their
Faith, gave us for answer, That they
believed a Creator, who resided in Hea∣ven,
for whom they had a great Ve∣neration;
They pay Adoration to the
Heavens, Sun, Moon, and Water; they
sacrifice Horses, Cows and Calves; They
expose their Skins only upon a Pole or
high Tree, to which they pay their De∣votion;
the Meat they eat afterwards.
They were altogether ignorant of any
thing relating to Baptism; they only told
us, that it was a most ancient Custom a∣mong
them, to name the Child after the
most ancient Person of the Village. They
are very careful to inter their Dead in
their best Accoutrements, being of opi∣nion
that at the Resurrection (which they
believe, without the least sense, whither
they are to go afterwards) every one is
to appear in the same posture and condi∣tion
as he was buried. The <HI>Muscovites</HI>
observe many Fasts throughout the Year,
but these were ignorant of what Fasting
meant; yet we observed that they did not
eat any Fowl, but only their Eggs, which
they look'd upon as a great Dainty.</P>
<P>Their Marriages are contracted and
performed in a very odd manner: If a
young Man, who intends to marry a
<PB N="23" REF="16"/>
young Woman, comes to ask her Father's
consent, the Answer is, If thou be'st in
a condition to pay for her, thou may'st
have her; so they make the bargain as
well as they can, the Bridegroom being
obliged to purchase the Bride from her
Father, sometimes for 40, sometimes for
50 or more Rubles, which amounts to
20 or 30 Pounds sterling. The Money
being paid, the Bride is surrendred to the
Bridegroom without any further Cere∣mony;
but if the Money be not ready,
there is no Bride to be had; they are yet
so civil to allow the Bridegroom a certain
time to raise the Money, and in the mean
while he has the liberty to court his Mi∣stress;
who, when the bargain is fulfill'd,
is carried veiled to his Bed-chamber. Af∣ter
the Bridegroom has gathered the first
fruits of his nuptial Bed, their Friends and
Relations are invited the next day to a
Feast, where they make themselves hearti∣ly
merry with Eating, Drinking, and Dan∣cing
till the next morning; when, after
they have made some Presents to the
young Couple, they part, to their own
homes.</P>
<P>What was credibly related to us con∣cerning
their Child-bearing Women, is no
less surprizing than the former: For when
<PB N="24" REF="17"/>
the time of their Delivery approaches,
they retire into some Forest or another,
where they stay for two Months after,
till having recovered their full strength,
they return to their Husbands. During
their stay in the Woods, their Husbands
dare not approach them under pain of
Death; these ignorant Wretches being
persuaded, that there are certain invisible
Persons inhabiting these Forests, who, as
they are very careful to preserve these
Women against any misfortune that might
befal them, so they would be sure to pu∣nish
the Husband with Death, if he should
be so presumptuous as to come near his
Wife, whilst she is under their protection
in the Forest.</P>
<P>We had the opportunity to be present
at the Burial of one of their Dogs: He was
of a very large Size, and had been, as it
seems, a good Hunting-Dog in his life∣time;
for which reason, these poor Wret∣ches
made sad moans and lamentations for
the loss of so serviceable a Creature: Af∣ter
having uttered many things in his
praise, they put him into a Grave dug for
that purpose, with a piece of Wood under
his Head, for fear he should lie uneasy;
and as a Monument of their gratitude for
his past Services, they erected a little Hutt
<PB N="25" REF="17"/>
over his Grave. We were credibly inform∣ed,
that it is a very ancient Custom among
these People, to bury all their Dogs, and to
reward their past Services in the same
manner.</P>
<P>Their manner of living is very miserable,
Husbandry being a thing unknown among
them: Hunting is their only livelihood;
Sables and the Reen-Deer being the only
Commodities this Country affords.</P>
<P>We pursued our Journey on the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of
<HI>May,</HI> leaving the small River called <HI>Silva
Reka</HI> on our right Hand, and towards
Noon the small River <HI>Kine,</HI> on the same
side, and towards Evening the River <HI>Sere∣brena
Reka,</HI> to the left of us. On the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of
<HI>May,</HI> we passed by <HI>Vlko Mesovasa</HI> and <HI>Sul∣lem
Reka</HI> to the left of us. On the 29<SUP>th</SUP>
of the same Month we left <HI>Vlko Serebrena
Reka</HI> on the same side, and on the Right
the River <HI>Doria Reka.</HI></P>
<P>On the 1<SUP>st</SUP> of <HI>Iune</HI> we came to <HI>Vlk<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gorod,</HI>
a Place fortified after the <HI>Russian</HI> manner,
with wooden Fortifications, but very small,
containing not above twenty Families.</P>
<P>We spent above three Weeks upon the
River <HI>Susowa,</HI> our Vessel being sometimes
drawn, sometimes rowed, but always
against the Current; which, by reason of
the many windings of the River, is very
<PB N="26" REF="18"/>
swift, and so violent, that we were some∣times
droven back for a quarter of a Mile
before we could recover our selves; be∣sides,
that we met with several Cataracts,
which took up a whole day before we
could pass them, and that not without
great danger. To add to our affliction,
we were continually pestered with such an
infinite number of Gnats, that, whatever
precaution we took, it was impossible for
us to preserve us against their fury.</P>
<P>All the way betwixt <HI>Solamsko</HI> and <HI>Vlko</HI>
we saw nothing but Desarts and Rocks on
both sides of us, which are most dreadful
to behold at a distance; and because we
could not go further up the River, we
were forc'd to tarry nine days at <HI>Vlko,</HI> be∣fore
we could be furnish'd with Land-Car∣riages;
which time we spent in providing
our selves with Forage and all other ne∣cessaries;
and on the 10<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Iune</HI> set for∣ward
again in our Journey to <HI>Newa,</HI> lea∣ving
our Baggage to follow us the next
day.</P>
<P>The 12<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Iune</HI> we travell'd through
a Town call'd <HI>Ajat,</HI> situate upon a River
of the same name; and the 13<SUP>th</SUP> to another
Town called <HI>Romasheva,</HI> upon the River
<HI>Resh.</HI> The Grounds hereabouts are very
fertile and well peopled, abounding in all
<PB N="27" REF="18"/>
sorts of Corn; and whereas, whilst we were
upon the River <HI>Susowa,</HI> we scarce got sight
of a Village in 60 Miles; we now could
not travel a Verst, or English Mile, with∣out
meeting with a good Village, where
we were furnish'd with every thing we
stood in need of.</P>
<P>Whilst we were in this Town, the In∣babitants
received Intelligence by Messen∣gers
and Letters sent for that purpose, that
the <HI>Calmu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k Tartars,</HI> to the Number of
6000, had made an Inroad into the next
Province; where they had made such mise∣rable
havock, with Murthering, Burning,
Plundering, and Driving away both Men
and Cattle, that they had put all the
Country round about under a great Con∣sternation,
as dreading the same treat∣ment.</P>
<P>On the 14<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Iune</HI> we reach'd <HI>Newagorod,</HI>
a small, but very pleasant Town; it has
but an indifferent Fortification, not much
better than <HI>Vlko;</HI> but is remarkable for
its Situation upon the River <HI>Newa,</HI> the
Boundary of <HI>Siberia</HI> on this side. This Jour∣ney
was very pleasant and diverting to us
after our former Fatigues and Dangers,
the Country being everywhere fill'd with
Inhabitants, and the Fields well cultiva∣ted,
the wild Roses, and other sweet
<PB N="28" REF="19"/>
Herbs, affording a very agreeable scent,
and a most delightful prospect. The plea∣santness
of the Place invited us to tarry
here a whole day, which we spent in walk∣ing
about the Fields, and gathering of
Roses, Lillies of the Valley, and such like▪
On the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Iune</HI> our Baggage arrived
at <HI>Newa-Gorod;</HI> and the next following
day we again received intelligence, that
the above-mentioned <HI>Calmuck Tartars</HI> were
advanced within four days Journey of this
Place; and that after they had made them∣selves
Masters of a certain Frontier Town,
which they had besieged, they intended
to march this way: The Inhabitants here∣abouts
being sufficiently sensible of the
Cruelties exercised by these Vagabonds in
their Excursions, were in most dreadful
fear of these Barbarians; and we forewar∣ned
of the approaching danger, hastned
the equipment of our Vessel; which being
got ready in five days after, we stay'd not
one moment longer: but after we had thus
spent seven days betwixt hope and fear
at <HI>Newa,</HI> we set out from thence on the
21<SUP>st</SUP> of <HI>Iune,</HI> steering our course upon the
River for <HI>Tobolsko,</HI> being provided with a
Convoy of 12 <HI>Cossacks</HI> of the Garison of
<HI>Newa,</HI> for our better security.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="19"/>
The River <HI>Resh</HI> falls 5 Miles above
<HI>Newa</HI> into another River, where, with its
stream, it loses its Name, and is from
thenceforward called <HI>Niatza.</HI> The first
Town we met with upon this River on
the 22<SUP>d</SUP>, is called <HI>Rudna;</HI> and not far from
thence another goodly Town called <HI>Nig∣niske,</HI>
situate in a very fertile and populous
Country, fit both for Pasturage and Til∣lage,
the Fields and Plains being sur∣rounded
and covered with Rose-trees,
which afford a most delightful prospect.</P>
<P>On the 23<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>Iune</HI> we pass'd by three
very handsome Towns, to wit, <HI>Iebitzke,
Kerginskoy,</HI> and <HI>Suborara.</HI> On the 24<SUP>th</SUP>
we came in sight of the Town called <HI>Ia∣lan,</HI>
famous for nothing else, but that
near it, this River joins its Current with
the River <HI>Kira.</HI> Towards the Evening
we saw another Town at some distance
named <HI>Krasna Hobod;</HI> and on the 25<SUP>th</SUP>,
about Midnight, came to the City of <HI>Tu∣men.</HI></P>
<P>It is a large and strong Place, being forti∣fied
with a very good Wall; the Inhabitants
are for the most part <HI>Tartars,</HI> who have
setled here for the conveniency of Trade:
They are much more civilized than any of
the other <HI>Tartars,</HI> by reason of their frequent
Conversation with Strangers. Most of
<PB N="30" REF="20"/>
these Towns furnish'd us with fresh Wa∣ter-men;
who being well rewarded for
their pains, so warmly ply'd their Oars,
that we advanced apace.</P>
<P>I cannot pass by here in silence the ex∣traordinary
Liberality and Hospitality of
the Inhabitants of these Parts; for we
scarce could pass by a Town, tho' never
so indifferent, but the Inhabitants would
come forth and bring us Provisions, and
sometimes Furs, without the least reward
or recompence, to our no small astonish∣ment,
who were not used to meet often
with such kind treatment among such
Barbarous Nations, they being generally
of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Race.</P>
<P>The next Town we met with, was cal∣led
<HI>Makowa,</HI> situate on the Confluence of
the Rivers <HI>Pishma Reka,</HI> and the <HI>Tura,</HI>
which runs by the City of <HI>Wergaturia.</HI></P>
<P>On the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Iune</HI> we came as far as
<HI>Sutska,</HI> situate on the Confluence of the
Rivers <HI>Tura</HI> and <HI>Tobol.</HI> The next day
we passed by <HI>Piesda Reka,</HI> and <HI>Turba Reka;</HI>
and on the 30<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Iune</HI> leaving the River
<HI>Taffda</HI> to the Left of us, we arrived safely
on the 1<SUP>st</SUP> day of <HI>Iuly</HI> in the City of <HI>To∣bolsko.</HI></P>
<P>This City, which is the Capital of <HI>Si∣beria,</HI>
is situate near the River <HI>Tobol,</HI> about
<PB N="31" REF="20"/>
3000 Miles from the City of <HI>Musco.</HI> It
is situate upon a Hill of a large Extent,
the Suburbs being most inhabited by <HI>Tar∣tars.</HI>
There is here a very fair Mona∣stery,
surrounded with a very strong
brick Wall. Near this Place the River
<HI>Irtish</HI> joins its Current with the River
<HI>Tobol; Tobolsko</HI> is not only the Capital,
but also the chief Place of Trade of all
<HI>Siberia.</HI> Their Traffick consists most in
Furrs, such as Sables, Ermins, Fox Skins,
and such-like.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Siberia</HI> is watered by
a great many large Rivers, among which
the River <HI>Oby</HI> is the chiefest. This River
has many Islands, which by reason of the
thick Woods are unpassable. In some
places the <HI>Oby</HI> is a League, in other places
half a League broad; it abounds in Fish,
such as Sturgeon, White-fish or <HI>Belluja's,</HI>
and others.</P>
<P>The principal Cities of <HI>Siberia</HI> are,
<HI>Werchaturia, Iapahzeen, Tumen, Tobolsko,
Narim, Tomskoy, Kosnezi, Krasnojer, Ker,
Ienokisko, Ilim, Mongassy,</HI> most of which
are very large and populous Cities. The
Kingdom of <HI>Siberia</HI> is surrounded by se∣veral
<HI>Tartarian</HI> Nations, such as the <HI>Cal∣muck
Tartars,</HI> the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Mongul,</HI> and
others, as the <HI>Tungoskoy, Bratzkoy, Osti∣acky,
<PB N="32" REF="21"/>
Barrabinsy,</HI> governed by their own
Princes, and each of them distinguish'd
by their different Languages. The <HI>Sa∣moyedes</HI>
are under the Jurisdiction of the
<HI>Czars</HI> of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>The Natives of <HI>Siberia</HI> are much ad∣dicted
to Sorcery and Idolatry. The <HI>Rus∣sians</HI>
inhabit most of the Cities; <HI>Czar
Iohn Basilovits</HI> was the first who brought
this Kingdom under his Jurisdiction, after
he had conquered the two <HI>Tartarian</HI> King∣doms
of <HI>Casan</HI> and <HI>Astrachan;</HI> since which
time they pay their yearly Tribute of all
sorts of Furrs which are found in <HI>Siberia,</HI>
to wit, Sables, Martins, red and white
Fox Skins, which amount to Two hun∣dred
thousand Rubles <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>The Sables are catch'd by the Inhabi∣tants
by Traps, not unlike our Rat and
Mice-Traps; but they have also another
way of Hunting and Killing the Sables,
of which we shall have occasion to speak
anon. They go a Sable hunting with Sleds
drawn by Dogs, who carry the Sleds with
more ease over the Snow than Horses.
The <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> has the Twentieth
of all the Sables that are catch'd through∣out
the Year; we being obliged to stay
for some time at <HI>Tobolsko,</HI> as well to re∣pose
our selves after so tedious and trouble∣some
<PB N="33" REF="21"/>
a Journey, as to make all necessary
Preparations for the future; we passed
our time very pleasantly in the Company
of the <HI>Waywode</HI> or Governor <HI>Stepan Iva∣novits
Sotticove,</HI> and his two Sons <HI>Fedor
Stepanovits,</HI> and <HI>Ivan Stepanovits,</HI> who
shew'd us all the Civilities in the World,
and there pass'd few days but that they
either were with us, or we with them,
and entertain'd one another with every
thing the Place would afford.</P>
<P>The Ambassador having dispatch'd in
the mean while an Express to their <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesties, and every thing being provided
for the prosecution of our Journey, we
put as many Provisions, Forage, and other
Necessaries on board our two Vessels, as
would serve us for three Months: For,
from hence to <HI>Ienokisko,</HI> whither we were
bound, is 6000 Miles, for the most part
through a desolate Country, where there
is but little Forage and Provision to be
met with.</P>
<P>Accordingly after we had all taken our
leave from the Governor and his Sons, we
went on board our Vessels on the 22<SUP>d</SUP> of
<HI>Iuly,</HI> under convoy of 20 <HI>Strelitzes</HI> or
Musqueteers, who were to conduct us to
<HI>Surgutt,</HI> and directed our Course upon
the River <HI>Irish,</HI> towards <HI>Ienokisko.</HI> The
<PB N="34" REF="22"/>
24<SUP>th</SUP> we sailed with a fair Gale by a Town
called <HI>Dernjan;</HI> but having occasion for
fresh Water-men, we went on shoar till
we could be supplied with some. Near
this place the River <HI>Derjansko</HI> falls into
the <HI>Irtish</HI> on the Right hand, and the In∣habitants
hereabouts being <HI>Ostiaky,</HI> a lazy
and idle People, we changed our Water-men
sometimes twice and thrice a day:
Of their manner of Living we shall speak
more hereafter.</P>
<P>On the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Iuly,</HI> early in the Morn∣ing,
we came to a Town called <HI>Samurs∣kojam,</HI>
where we stay'd till the 29<SUP>th</SUP>, when
we got on board again by break of day.
We had scarce sailed two Miles upon the
River <HI>Irtish,</HI> when we pass'd into ano∣ther
lesser River; which being a Branch
of the River <HI>Oby,</HI> we were towed up a∣gainst
the Current, and at last, on the
first day of <HI>August,</HI> entred that famous Ri∣ver
<HI>Oby.</HI> This River rising among the
<HI>Calmuck Tartars</HI> from the South-West,
disembogues in the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Sea; it is
very dangerous for Ships, by reason of its
depth, and the many Rocks, which ren∣der
its Waters very boisterous. The 6<SUP>th</SUP>
of <HI>August</HI> we reach'd the City of <HI>Surgutt,</HI>
a Place which has nothing remarkable,
but a small Garison; the Governor of
<PB N="35" REF="22"/>
which having given us 16 of them to
convoy us to <HI>Narim,</HI> we sent back those
we had taken along with us from <HI>Tobol∣sko.</HI>
Hereabouts you see nothing but a
barren desolate Country, inhabited by a
few miserable Wretches, who have scarce
wherewithal to cover their Nakedness,
all their Employment being Hunting of
Sables, Ermins and Foxes.</P>
<P>They catch here the Sables in a quite
different manner from what we have re∣lated
before; for they shoot them with
Arrows, or they make fire under the
Trees where they know the Sables do
shelter themselves; who being suffocated
by the Smoak, fall from the Trees, and
are soon catch'd. The Ermins they catch
in Traps, and the Foxes they hunt with
Dogs. We stay'd here till the 9<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Au∣gust,</HI>
when being furnish'd with fresh and
sturdy young Water-men, who encoura∣ged
by the hopes of a good Reward, stood
briskly to their Oars, We passed the 13<SUP>th</SUP>
the River <HI>Wache</HI> to the Left of us, on the
19<SUP>th</SUP> the River <HI>Tim,</HI> and on the 24<SUP>th</SUP> ar∣rived
safely at <HI>Narim,</HI> a City situate on
the Left-side of us upon the River <HI>Oby.</HI></P>
<P>It is worth observation, that in the Win∣ter-time
there is no Travelling from <HI>To∣bolsko</HI>
to <HI>Narim</HI> with Horses, but this
<PB N="36" REF="23"/>
Journey must be performed in Sleds drawn
by Dogs; they put three or four of them
before the Sled, and whip them along
as we do our Horses. When they go
abroad a Hunting, they put their Provisi∣ons
and Hunting tackle, such as Bows,
Arrows, Launces, and such-like, in one of
these Sleds drawn by Dogs, and thus tra∣vel
to their rendezvouz, which is some∣times
14 or 15 days Journey from their
Habitations, and many times don't return
in two months.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ostiaky</HI> living in these Parts, make
use of these Sleds in the same manner
when they go abroad a Fishing; so that
you may see them bring their Fish to
Market in many Sleds all drawn (in the
Winter-time) by Dogs.</P>
<P>We were provided here with new
Barge-men, and 24 <HI>Cossacks,</HI> who were to
convoy us to <HI>Ienokisko,</HI> and on the 25<SUP>th</SUP>
of <HI>August</HI> re-imbark'd upon the River
<HI>Oby,</HI> which we left on the 29<SUP>th</SUP> of the
same month, and entred the River <HI>Ketto,</HI>
where being obliged to Row against the
Current, we were above a month before
we could reach the Town of <HI>Mokuskoy,</HI>
from whence we continued our Journey
by Land to <HI>Ienokisko.</HI> We saw abun∣dance
of Cedar-trees on both sides of the
<PB N="37" REF="23"/>
River <HI>Ketto,</HI> and on the first of <HI>Septem∣ber</HI>
refresh'd our selves at a small Town
called <HI>Kettskoy.</HI> But meeting with very
slender Accommodation, we got on board
again the same night, and did not stir out
of the Vessel till the 28<SUP>th</SUP> following, there
being nothing but Desarts on both sides
of the River. On the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>September</HI>
we were all on a sudden put under a great
Consternation; for it having frozen very
hard the night before, we were in no small
apprehension of the danger of perishing
for want of Necessaries in these Desarts,
which must have been infallibly our fate,
if the Frost had continued longer; but,
as good fortune would have it, we were
soon freed from this Danger by a very
agreeable Thaw; and being, besides this,
encouraged by a fresh and favourable
Gale, we made use of all our Skill; and
on the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of the same month came to
a Monastery, situate upon the Banks of
the River, where we reposed our selves
for some days, after a long fatigue of a
whole month; and in remembrance of
the past danger, kept a Thanksgiving day
there on the 2<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> to offer our
Thanks to God Almighty for our Delive∣rance,
and to implore his Mercy for the
future.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="24"/>
After Prayers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we set Sail again the
same Evening, when we passed a small
Village, which contained not above six
Families. We saw hereabouts abundance
of Currant-trees, both black and red; we
had met with some of them before near
this River, but no where else in so great
a quantity, which made us judge, the
Grounds hereabouts were more kind and
fruitful than in other places. On the 3<SUP>d</SUP>
of <HI>October</HI> died one of the Ambassador's
Retinue after 13 days illness: His Name
was <HI>Iohn George Weltzel,</HI> a Native of
<HI>Germany,</HI> of the City of <HI>Golding</HI> in <HI>Silesia,</HI>
by his Profession a Painter. On the 7<SUP>th</SUP>
of the same month, we got safely to the
so long wish'd for small City of <HI>Mokuskoy,</HI>
where, among other things, we gratified
our selves with a cool draught of very
good Beer. By Orders from the Ambas∣sador
we interr'd the dead Body of our
Friend upon a Hill, upon the very Banks
of the River <HI>Ietto,</HI> where we put a Cross;
this being the only Monument we were
capable of dedicating to the Memory of
our deceased Fellow-traveller.</P>
<P>After we had a little recovered our
selves from the past Fatigues, the Ambas∣sador,
and most of his Retinue, pursued
their Journey by Land on the 10<SUP>th</SUP> of
<PB N="39" REF="24"/>
<HI>October,</HI> leaving nine of his Attendance
behind to take care of the Baggage, which
was to follow us, as soon as the Roads
should be rendred convenient for the pas∣sage
of Sleds. We travell'd for two days
and nights through a most dreadful Forest,
till on the 12<SUP>th</SUP> of the same month we came
in sight of <HI>Ienokisko,</HI> where we made our
publick Entrance the same night, with so
much Magnificence, that the Inhabitants
were surprized thereat. This City lies
upon the River <HI>Ienska,</HI> famous not only
for the conveniency of Shipping, but also
for the most prodigious Plenty of Fish it
affords. Betwixt this Place and <HI>Tobolsko</HI>
the <HI>Ostiacky</HI> have their Habitations. They
are low of Stature, and very deformed;
besides which, both Men and Women con∣stantly
are subject to a certain Weakness
in their Eyes, the cause of which they at∣tribute
to the want of Bread; which be∣ing
a scarce Commodity among them,
they seldom are masters of it, unless they
are by chance furnish'd with it by Travel∣lers;
which happening very rarely in so
remote a Country, we supplied them with
what we were able to spare: Their com∣mon
Food is River-fish; and instead of
Bread, they make use of the same Fish
dried. Whilst we were as yet upon the
<PB N="40" REF="25"/>
River <HI>Oby,</HI> we were every day suppli'd
with great Quantities of the best River-fish
by those <HI>Ostiacky,</HI> who refused our
Money, but earnestly entreated us to give
them in lieu of it some Salt, Bread, and
<HI>Chinese Sharr</HI> or Tobacco, which we did
accordingly.</P>
<P>Not far from the Banks of the River
<HI>Ketto,</HI> I espied one day some wretched
Hutts, which believing to belong to the
<HI>Ostiacky;</HI> and being willing to satisfy my
curiosity in taking a view of their Habita∣tions,
I got on shore; and having easily
got admission by the help of a small Pre∣sent
of Bread and Salt to the Owners, I
entred them, which made a wretched ap∣pearance,
being made only of the Barks
of Trees.</P>
<P>One among them, somewhat bigger
than the rest, and distinguish'd by certain
Figures, invited my Curiosity to take a
full View of it. Being entred, I found
three Women lying upon the Ground,
who at the sight of me arose from their
places, and by their noddings and threat∣nings
sufficiently testified their displea∣sure
of seeing a Stranger to interrupt them
in their retirement; but being sensible
that I had prepared my way by the Pre∣sents
given to the Owners, I took, not∣withstanding
<PB N="41" REF="25"/>
all their wry Faces, the li∣berty
to search every corner of the Hutt.
These three Women, as I was informed
afterwards, were the Wives of so many
<HI>Knezes</HI> or Dukes of the <HI>Ostiacky,</HI> but their
Equipage appear'd little suitable to their
Quality, for I could not meet with any
thing worth taking notice of all over the
Hall but their <HI>Sheitan,</HI> or (as they them∣selves
call'd it) their God: This Idol was
of Wood, of about a Yard in length, ap∣pearing
most dreadful at first sight; the
Head of it being covered with a strong
Tin or Iron-Plate, which look'd as black
as a Chimney-stock, by reason of the ma∣ny
Incenses which they offer to this Idol.
For the rest, it was dress'd up in a ragged
Coat of woollen Cloth, patch'd together
with 1000 pieces of all sorts of Colours;
I don't remember that ever I saw the most
wretched Beggar make so miserable an ap∣pearance
as this their God, unto whom
this superstitious People attribute a Power
of preserving them from ill. All the while
we were upon the River betwixt <HI>Sergutt</HI>
and <HI>Mokuskoy,</HI> we had no other Barge-men
but these <HI>Ostiacky;</HI> who, though they were
young and lustly Fellows, and were well
entertained on Board of our Vessels, yet
were so lazy, that they would rather have
<PB N="42" REF="26"/>
sate at home and starved, than to come and
work for a good livelihood. It is by rea∣son
of this their lazy Temper, that they
seldom take the pains to go abroad a
Hunting. And for the same reason it is,
that they change continually their Habi∣tations,
sometimes 16 or 20 times in a
year, because, say they, we are willing
to put our selves beyond the reach of such
Travellers who come this way, and often∣times,
sorely against our wills, force us
to the Oars.</P>
<P>The Ambassador being willing to di∣vert
us with the simplicity of these igno∣rant
Wretches, he caused his <HI>Valet du Cham∣bre</HI>
to bring forth a wooden Drummer;
which being very artificially made with
Clook-work within, beat the Drum, and
express'd some other Motions of the Head,
Eyes and Hands so naturally, that the <HI>Osti∣acky</HI>
being at first surprized at it, started
back; but having a little recovered them∣selves,
and taken a full view of all his Po∣stures,
they knock'd their Heads against
the Ground, prostrating themselves before
the wooden Drummer in the same manner
as they do before their <HI>Sheitan,</HI> or God;
at which we could not forbear laugh∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="26"/>
To continue the sport, a wooden Bear
was brought forth by the Ambassador's
Order, who, as he was made after the
same fashion, so he beat the Drum with
his fore-paws, and all the Motions of the
Head and Eyes as artificially as the Drum∣mer;
wherefore they also paid him the
same Veneration. But they soon gave us
to understand, that they were much more
taken with the Drummer than with the
Bear; for they with a very profound Re∣verence
begg'd the Ambassador to bestow
upon them the Drummer, offering to
give the weight of him in Money. But
the Ambassador, being unwilling to en∣courage
their Idolatry, and for some other
Reasons, denied their Request.</P>
<P>Their Garments are made of the Skins
of Beasts, with the Furr on the out-side;
in the Summer they cloath themselves with
the Skins of Fishes. We also made this
Observation among them, That some have
their <HI>Sheitan</HI> or Idol made of Wood, others
of Lead, and others again of Brass, ac∣cording
to their several Abilities; and the
poorer sort dress them up in Rags, the
richer in Sables.</P>
<P>They have a very odd way of paying
their Devotion to this Idol: For, instead
of saying their Prayers, they whistle a
<PB N="44" REF="27"/>
certain Tune, with strange Postures, clap∣ping
their Hands together, beating their
Heads to the ground, and making many
Gesticulations with their Feet as they lie
prostrate before them, with many more
such-like ridiculous Ceremonies, too many
to insert here.</P>
<P>Whenever they Feast, they set a certain
share of the best Dish aside for the <HI>Sheitan;</HI>
which if they should neglect, they are of
opinion, that the Victuals they eat, would
turn to Worms in their Bowels; and if
they should take it away again from be∣fore
the Idol, they are persuaded, they
should be struck Lame in all their Limbs.
We were credibly informed, that at cer∣tain
times they met in their Hutts, where
they first began with Whistling, and after∣wards
continued to make most horrid Out-cries
and Lamentations, till a certain Spe∣ctre
appear'd to them, which foretold
them what was to happen to them the
next year: as for instance, whether they
were to be plagued with Famine; whe∣ther
they should be fortunate or unfortu∣nate
in their Hunting and Fishing; whe∣ther
they should continue in Health or not;
whether they should marry young or old
Wives; whether they should die a Natu∣ral
death, or whether they should be slain
<PB N="45" REF="27"/>
or torn to pieces by the Bears and other
wild Creatures; and more of such like
Predictions: which done, they pay their
Adoration to the Spectre; and that being
vanish'd, they look upon its Predictions
as infallible, and accordingly attend their
Fate with an unshaken resolution. They
also pay a kind of Veneration to the Bear-Skin,
and swear by it. When they have
shot a Bear, they cut off his Head; and
paying their Veneration to it, they whistle
and ask, <HI>Who is it that kill'd thee? the</HI>
Russians <HI>did it. Who cut off thy Head?
the</HI> Russian <HI>Axe did it. Who is it that has
handled thee thus? the</HI> Russians <HI>have done
it;</HI> laying thus all the fault upon the <HI>Russi∣ans.</HI></P>
<P>These blind and ignorant Wretches have
nevertheless this good Quality belonging
to them, that they don't Curse nor Swear;
for which they shew such an abhorrence,
that they take care to make very lively
Impressions against this Vice in their
young Babes; being persuaded, That he
who Swears falsely or foolishly, shall cer∣tainly
be unfortunate the whole Year,
and be in danger of being torn to pieces
by the Bears, or other wild Beasts.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="28"/>
For the rest, the <HI>Ostiacky</HI> are great Ad∣mirers
of <HI>Chinese Sharr</HI> or Tobacco, which
they take in a manner peculiar to them∣selves:
For when they intend to Smoak,
they fill their Mouth with Water; and so
sucking the Tobacco-smoak in greedily,
swallow it down with the Water. For
which reason it is, that generally at the
taking of the first Pipe in the Morning,
they fall down drunk and insensible, but
soon recover themselves. They seldom
take Tobacco sitting, but always standing.
For want of Tobacco, they smoak the sha∣vings
of their Tobacco-pipes, which are
made of Wood, after a very course fa∣shion.</P>
<P>We stay'd in the City of <HI>Ienokisko,</HI> or <HI>Ie∣nessay,</HI>
ten Weeks, where we were extream∣ly
civilly treated by the Inhabitants, but
most especially by the Governor. On the
13<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>December</HI> we sent our heavy Bag∣gage
before upon Sleds, and the Ambassa∣dor
with his Retinue followed on the 21<SUP>st</SUP>
of the same month, taking our way to∣wards
<HI>Irkutskoy.</HI> We were conducted out
of the Town to the next Village, as well by
the Governor himself as the chiefest Inha∣bitants;
and after having bid one another
farewel, we continued our Journey for
some time upon the River <HI>Ienska,</HI> which
<PB N="47" REF="28"/>
we afterwards left to our Right, and pass'd
all along the River <HI>Tungusko Reka,</HI> or <HI>Ton∣gusi,</HI>
the Boundary of <HI>Tungoeses</HI> on this side,
of whom we shall have occasion to speak
more hereafter. We pass'd by several
Villages on both sides of the River, and
on the 30<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>December</HI> took up our Quar∣ters
in the Village called <HI>Buhutsha,</HI> where
we refresh'd our selves for four and twenty
hours. Beyond this Village begins the
great <HI>Wolock</HI> or Desart, where you travel
8 or 10 days, without meeting any Vil∣lage,
or House fit for Entertainment.</P>
<P>In the Year 1693, on New-years-day,
we left the above-mentioned Village, and
entred the above-mentioned <HI>Wolock</HI> or De∣sart,
which proved very troublesome to
us by reason of the Coldness of the Wea∣ther,
which was so excessive, that our
Victuals and Drink (which was only fair
Water) froze, and turn'd to Ice, before
we could bring it from hand to mouth.
And when we had occasion to travel upon
the River, the Mountains of Ice, which
often obstructed our passage, were such
Obstacles as were not easy to be sur∣mounted,
being obliged to cut our way
through them with Axes. This prodigi∣ous
Quantity of Ice, and the uneven Ways
which are all over the Desart, deter most
<PB N="48" REF="29"/>
Travellers from taking this Road in the
Winter-time. We had once more the
good fortune to overcome all these diffi∣culties,
and on the 8<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Ianuary</HI> came
safely to the Village called <HI>Kasma.</HI> To re∣fresh
our selves and our Horses after so
troublesome a Journey, we were obliged
to stay here 13 days, which time we em∣ployed
in sending for fresh Horses, and
in taking a view of the Habitations of the
<HI>Tongueses,</HI> of whom I will give you a
short Relation.</P>
<P>They were formerly a War-like Nation,
governed by its own Princes, inhabiting
a very large Countrey. But they have of
late years been conquered by the Victori∣ous
Arms of the <HI>Czars</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> unto
whom they pay a yearly Tribute.</P>
<P>As to their Persons, they are very lusty
and well proportion'd, their Cloaths be∣ing
nothing but the Skins of Beasts, with
the Furrs on the outside of divers Colours,
neither Sex being to be distinguish'd by
the least difference in their Habits. They
take a particular pride to have their Cheeks
stitch'd (whilst they are young) with black
Thread through and through, some cross∣ways,
some in imitation of a Square, or
any other figure they like best. This un∣accountable
piece of Pride, as painful as
<PB N="49" REF="29"/>
it is, (as causing great Swellings in their
Faces) they look upon it as Badges of
Honour, transmitted to them from their
Ancestors; the marks of which they re∣tain
with a great deal of satisfaction till
their dying-day.</P>
<P>Their Cabans or Hutts are generally
made of the Skins of the Reens, or some
other wild Beasts; those of the better sort
of the Barks of Trees: It is a most sur∣prizing
thing to conceive how these poor
Wretches are able to defend themselves a∣gainst
the Violence of the Cold, in such
miserable Cottages; but Custom has inu∣red
them to endure these Hardships with∣out
the least inconveniency to themselves.
For no sooner are their Children come in∣to
the World, but they lay them in the
Summer in cold Water, in the Winter in
the Snow; by which means they are so
accustomed to Cold, that they are the
hardiest People in the World.</P>
<P>They are distinguish'd into three sorts:
The first are called <HI>Kunny Tungoesi,</HI> who
make use of Horses. The second <HI>Alenny,</HI>
who live altogether upon Hunting. The
third <HI>Sobaltzy,</HI> who live more like Dogs
than Men.</P>
<P>Their Idols are made only of Wood,
every one has his domestick or tutelar God.
<PB N="50" REF="30"/>
There is one who is look'd upon as the
Patron of Hunting, who sends them
good fortune when they go a Hunting af∣ter
the wild Beast or wild Fowl. Ano∣ther
makes them successful in catching of
Sables; another in Fishing: But some∣times
they use their Gods but scurvily;
for, if they have offered up their Prayers
to them, and are deceived in their expecta∣tion,
the God is thrown out of doors,
till they happen to have better luck; then
they are admitted again, and have their
full and best share of what they have got
abroad▪</P>
<P>If five or six of these <HI>Tonguese</HI> Families
happen to live near one another (which
is very rarely seen) they maintain be∣twixt
them a <HI>Shaman,</HI> which signifies as
much as a Sorcerer or Priest. At their
Meetings this Priest appears in a Habit
distinguish'd by many Figures of Beasts,
such as Lions, Bears, Serpents, Adders,
and such-like; which being all of Iron,
weigh generally above Two hundred
pounds weight. Then he beats a Drum
in a very doleful manner, at which the
standers-by break out into most dreadful
Lamentations and Outcries, pretending
that they see certain Spectres in the figures
of Ravens and other strange Birds; and
<PB N="51" REF="30"/>
the Priest, as if strucken with an Epilep∣tick-fit,
falls down upon the ground, and
is reverenc'd by these ignorant People as
a Saint.</P>
<P>How mean and miserable soever their
Condition is, they all of them have seve∣ral
Wives, whom they look upon as their
greatest Treasure: The richer sort have
often 10 or 12, whom they buy from
their Fathers, sometimes for 10, some∣times
for 15 Reen-deers a-piece.</P>
<P>Their manner of taking an Oath is most
abominable: For, he that is to confirm
the truth of a thing by his solemn Oath,
is obliged to suck the Blood of a Dog
wounded for this purpose, with a Knife
in his left fore leg, till he expires. They
don't bury their dead Corps, but hang
them on Trees, where they putrify, and
at last waste away. They are very cau∣tious
of Swearing or Cursing; the worst
Curse they give one another, is to wish
them to be forced to live among the <HI>Rus∣sians,</HI>
or to Till the Ground, and such-like.</P>
<P>On the 21<SUP>st</SUP> of <HI>Ianuary</HI> we left the Vil∣lage
of <HI>Kasma,</HI> and continued our Jour∣ney
in Sleds upon the River <HI>Tunguska,</HI> or
<HI>Tongusi,</HI> till after some time leaving it to
the right of us, we passed from thence to
<PB N="52" REF="31"/>
the small River <HI>Ilim;</HI> both these Rivers
are well peopled on both sides of the Shoar.
On the 25<SUP>th</SUP> we arrived in the small City
of <HI>Ilimskoy,</HI> situate upon the River <HI>Ilim,</HI>
in the very Center of some high Moun∣tains
which surround it. On the 27<SUP>th</SUP>
we continued our Journey from thence
through a great Forest, which by reason
of the badness of the Ways, we did not
lay behind us till after a troublesome Jour∣ney
of three days and nights, when we
came to the River <HI>Angara,</HI> where we
pass'd by many others of less note, the
Isle of <HI>Balagansko</HI> and <HI>Kamenko,</HI> which
are well peopled. Hereabouts live the
<HI>Brattskoy,</HI> who being of the Race of the
<HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI> are Tributaries to the
<HI>Czars</HI> of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> Betwixt <HI>Ienokitsko</HI> or
<HI>Ienessay,</HI> and <HI>Irkutskoy,</HI> great Quantities
of Martins and Foxes are caught in the
beginning of the Winter; but about <HI>Ieno∣kisko</HI>
are the best black Foxes, which are
sold at 20, 25, and 30 Rubles a-piece.</P>
<P>On the 11<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>February</HI> we arrived
safely in the City of <HI>Irkutskoy,</HI> situate up∣on
the River <HI>Angara,</HI> where, for several
Reasons we stay'd a whole month, in
which time we receiv'd all manner of ci∣vility
from the Governor <HI>Knez Ivan Pe∣trovits
Gargaran.</HI> As he used often to
<PB N="53" REF="31"/>
invite us to Dinner, I met several times
there with a certain person, who being
accounted a Saint among the <HI>Mongul Tar∣tars,</HI>
used to mutter out his Prayers, which
were very long, holding in his Hands a
long String with red Coral Beads, which
he told without intermission. On the
15<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>February</HI> the Ambassador dis∣patch'd
a Messenger to the City of <HI>Naun,</HI>
on the Frontiers of <HI>China,</HI> to notify our
Arrival in those Parts. On the 9<SUP>th</SUP> of
<HI>March</HI> we left the City of <HI>Irkutskoy,</HI> and
being conducted out of the Town by the
Governor and the chief Inhabitants to the
next Village, we spent the whole night
there in making good Cheer; and having
bid one another Adieu, the next morning
we came on the 10<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI> in sight of
the Lake of <HI>Baikala,</HI> where the River <HI>An∣gara</HI>
has its rise.</P>
<P>This River was from the City of <HI>Ir∣kutskoy,</HI>
to its Entrance into the Lake, quite
free from Ice, and had been so all the Win∣ter
long. They count it 30 Miles from the
City to the Lake, the utmost Boundary
of the Kingdom of <HI>Siberia.</HI></P>
<P>The Lake of <HI>Biakala</HI> is about four days.
Journey in length, but at this Season we
passed its breadth with Sleds in six hours.
It is more dangerous in the Summer by
<PB N="54" REF="32"/>
reason of the changeableness of the Winds:
The Inhabitants have this superstitious
opinion concerning it, That whoever calls
it <HI>Oser</HI> or a Lake, will scarce pass it with∣out
danger; but those who give it the
Title of <HI>Mor</HI> or Sea, need not fear any
thing. We dined on the 11<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI>
upon the said Lake, and towards Evening
discovered six Cabans or Hutts belonging
to the above-mentioned <HI>Brattskoy.</HI> Near
these Hutts we saw a dead Sheep and Goat
fix'd upon a Tree with the Heads upwards,
which, they told us, were two Sacrifices
made to the Heavens. I made the best
inquiry I could concerning their Religion,
but could get no satisfactory Account,
only that they used to sacrifice a Sheep
and a Goat once a year to the Creator of
the Heavens, and that they adore the Sun.
They are very industrious in Breeding of
Cattle, but especially of Camels for the
conveniency of the Caravans travelling to
<HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>We came the same Evening to a Mona∣stery
on the other side of the Lake, situate
upon the Frontiers of the Province of <HI>Dau∣ri,</HI>
a very large and fertile Country. The
next Morning, being the 12<SUP>th</SUP>, we passed
through the Towns of <HI>Kabania</HI> and <HI>Bol∣sko
Sainko,</HI> both small Places, but well
<PB N="55" REF="32"/>
fortified by the Inhabitants, they serving
them as Bulwarks against the <HI>Tartars</HI> of
<HI>Mongul,</HI> On the 19<SUP>th</SUP> of the same Month
we came in sight of <HI>Vdinskoy,</HI> and the
Ambassador was met three Miles out of
Town by an Officer at the Head of 50
<HI>Cossacks,</HI> who conducted him to the City,
where he was received under the discharge
of the Cannon. This Place, which is con∣sidered
here as the Key of the Province of
<HI>Dauri,</HI> has not been inhabited above six
Years. The Castle, which is very well
fortified after the <HI>Russian</HI> manner, lies up∣on
a Hill, from whence they have at se∣veral
times bravely repulsed the <HI>Mongul
Tartars</HI> that assaulted them. We lay still
here three Weeks, which time we spent
(as we had done at <HI>Irkutskoy</HI>) in buying
of Cattle for the conveniency of our Car∣riage.
We bought Camels at 10 or 15 Ru∣bles
apiece, and Horses for 4, 5, or 6 Ru∣bles.
We provided our selves also with
as many Oxen as might furnish us with
Beef in our Journey to <HI>China,</HI> and back
again.</P>
<P>Being now to travel through the great
Desart belonging to the <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI>
we pack'd our Baggage upon Camels and
Horses, the first carrying about 600 weight,
the last about 250: We entred the Desart
<PB N="56" REF="33"/>
on the 6<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April,</HI> our Caravan consist∣ing
of 250 Men, some Hundreds of Ca∣mels
and Horses, and 400 Waggons, which
in the night-time being drawn up in a Cir∣cle,
enclosed the rest, and at some distance
from thence we placed our Centries, to ad∣vertise
us of the approach of our Enemies,
if any should appear. But they not da∣ring
to attack us, took another course to
vex us to the utmost of their power;
for during the space of three Weeks, that
we travell'd through this Desart, where
we often were in want of Water for Men
and Beast, the <HI>Monguls</HI> and <HI>Tongueses</HI>
burnt that small quantity of dry Winter-grass
that was left, before us; so that be∣ing
unprovided with Forage, we saw our
Beasts, but especially our Horses, drop
down dead for want of Fother; and what
was the worst of all, the rest were become
so lean, that they were almost rendred
quite unserviceable. We lost above a
hundred Horses in this Journey, to the
great satisfaction of the <HI>Tongueses;</HI> who
Iooking upon Horse-flesh as a great Dainty,
devoured them so soon as we had left them.
The <HI>Tongueses,</HI> who are dispersed through
these Desarts, are of the same Religion
with the <HI>Brattskoy,</HI> whom we have men∣tioned
before. They bury with the dead
<PB N="57" REF="33"/>
Corps of their Friends all their best Move∣ables;
and if they become decrepit before
they die, they lead them upon a high
Mountain, where they burn them, and
impale their best Horse near it.</P>
<P>The 24<SUP>th</SUP> and 25<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April</HI> we passed
to the left of us by a Lake called <HI>Ierawena,</HI>
abounding with all sorts of very good
Fish; it is 20 Miles long, and 15 broad.
Here it was we met with the Messenger
who had been sent before by the Ambas∣sador
to <HI>Musko.</HI> On the 26<SUP>th</SUP> we came to
a small Place called <HI>Ierawena,</HI> where we
provided our selves with as many new
Horses as we could get for Money.</P>
<P>It is to be observed, that in the Desarts
round about <HI>Ierewena,</HI> there are the best
black Sables; the <HI>Cossacks</HI> of <HI>Ierwena,</HI> who
are the Sable-hunters hereabouts, go a∣broad
a Hunting sometimes for three or
four Months together; they make use of
Scates, by the help of which they pass
over the Snow with great Agility. We
bought some of these Sables of them, from
8 and 10, to 20, 30, and 50 Rubles a
pair.</P>
<P>On the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April</HI> we again entred
the Desart, but met here and there with
some Woods. The 29<SUP>th</SUP> we pass'd on Horse-back
the River <HI>Vda,</HI> which arises from a
<PB N="58" REF="34"/>
great Lake, and is here not above three
fathoms broad. The want of Fother con∣tinuing
among our Cattle, occasioned by
the revengefulness of the <HI>Monguls,</HI> we lost
abundance more of our Horses, and the
rest were so fatigued that we were in dan∣ger
of wanting Provisions, before we could
pass the Desarts. For which reason the
Ambassador commanded 10 Men to go
in quest of Horses, which they effected
with good success; for on the 3<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>May</HI>
they met us with a good number of fresh
Horses near the Lake, called <HI>Schack</HI>'s <HI>Oser,</HI>
which is four Miles long, and two broad.
We had the good fortune to find here some
Fother for our Horses and Camels, which
obliged us to stay here till the 5<SUP>th</SUP> of the
same Month, when leaving the Lake to
our Left, we continued our Journey to
another Lake, which we pass'd by on the
6<SUP>th</SUP> in the Morning, and the same day in
the Afternoon reach'd the end of this trou∣blesome
Desart, after a most tedious and
fatiguing Journey of near four Weeks.</P>
<P>The first Place we came to, is called
<HI>Plotbus,</HI> near the small River <HI>Skieta,</HI> con∣taining
not above six Families, who are
settled there but very lately.</P>
<P>On the 15<SUP>th</SUP> we continued our Journey
from <HI>Plotbus</HI> by Water upon Floats of
<PB N="59" REF="34"/>
Wood to <HI>Nartzinskoy.</HI> About a Mile
from <HI>Plotbus</HI> the River <HI>Schieta</HI> falls into
the River <HI>Ingeda,</HI> as the River <HI>Okkon</HI> joins
its Current with the same at a small di∣stance
from thence, and is afterwards cal∣led
<HI>Schiteka.</HI> The Rivers <HI>Nertza</HI> and <HI>Ar∣gun</HI>
fall afterwards into the same River,
out of the last of which arises the famous
River of <HI>Yamour,</HI> which disembogues into
the Ocean. On the 20<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May</HI> we came
to the City of <HI>Nertzinskoy,</HI> the last Place
of Note (unless it be <HI>Argun,</HI> a small Town
eight days Journey from thence) under
the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy.
Nertzinskoy</HI> is situate upon the River <HI>Nert∣za,</HI>
where about 6000 <HI>Tungoeses,</HI> all Sub∣jects
to the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> have their
Habitations; who have fortified them∣selves
here against their Enemies. Here∣abouts
are abundance of <HI>Lucerns</HI> and <HI>Sa∣bles,</HI>
which are in great Esteem among the
<HI>Chineses.</HI> We were fain to stay two Months
in this place, to give time to our Horses
and Camels to recover themselves in the
adjacent Pastures. The <HI>Cossacks</HI> here∣abouts
are very Rich, by reason of their
Traffick with <HI>China,</HI> where they are ex∣empted
from paying any Custom.</P>
<P>We then began to make all the necessa∣ry
Preparations for our Journey through
<PB N="60" REF="35"/>
the Desart; we provided our selves with
Oxen, which were to be killed by the way
as occasion should require; 50 <HI>Cossacks</HI>
were allotted us as a Convoy to <HI>China,</HI>
and to see us safe back again to <HI>Nertzin∣skoy,</HI>
and the Ambassador appointed such
Gentlemen as belonged to his Retinue to
manage all the Affairs belonging to the
whole Caravan, each in his respective
Station; who having the Command both
over the <HI>Russian</HI> Gentlemen and Mer∣chants,
were treated by them with a great
deal of Respect, especially the <HI>Germans,</HI>
who led the Van, in regard they had had
the Honour before their departure from
<HI>Musco</HI> to be admitted to Kiss their <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty's hands. On the 18<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Iuly,</HI>
when we were just ready to leave <HI>Nert∣zinsko,</HI>
two <HI>Cossacks</HI> brought Letters to the
Ambassador from <HI>Offdokim Andre Kurdi∣koff,</HI>
who, as we said before, had been
dispatch'd from <HI>Irkutzkoy</HI> to the City of
<HI>Naun,</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>China.</HI> The
Contents of these Letters were, That he
being not permitted to go to <HI>Peking,</HI> the
Residence of the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> had
been obliged to deliver his Letters at
<HI>Naun;</HI> which being dispatch'd from
thence to <HI>Peking,</HI> a certain Person of Qua∣lity,
attended by a great many Servants,
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>
was come to <HI>Naun</HI> to expect the Ambassa∣dor's
Arrival. That the said <HI>Chinese</HI> Lord
having sent for him, had asked him, a∣mong
other things, upon what account
the Ambassador was sent to the <HI>Kams
Hi Ammaogdo Chan?</HI> To which he had
answered, That he did not know the least
thing of it; but if he did, it would not
become him to discover it. He had fur∣ther
asked him, What Countreyman the
Ambassador was, and in what Station at
Court? To which he had reply'd, That
he was not able to give him an exact ac∣count
of the matter, he having been only
taken into his Service at <HI>Irtkutskoy,</HI> from
whence he had soon after been dispatch'd
to <HI>Naun;</HI> That all what he could tell was,
That the Ambassador was a <HI>German</HI> by
Birth, and in great Favour at Court, de∣siring
him to supersede to ask him any
further Questions, which he was not in a
capacity to answer.</P>
<P>We did not set out from <HI>Nertzinskoy</HI> till
in the Afternoon, to wit, on the 18<SUP>th</SUP> of
<HI>Iuly,</HI> and reached the same Night with
part of our Caravan the River <HI>Schileka,</HI>
where we ferried over. But our whole
Caravan consisting of 400 Men, we stay'd
here three days, this being the place of
our rendezvouz. From hence the Am∣bassador
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>
dispatch'd a Messenger, whose
Name was <HI>Andre Avonass Kruhoff,</HI> to their
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's in <HI>Musco.</HI></P>
<P>There were abundance of Gentlemen
and Merchants belonging to our Caravan,
who traded with Furrs to <HI>China.</HI> Each
of them had 30 Pounds weight of Bisket
allotted him for his share, during our
whole Journey through the <HI>Tartarian</HI> De∣sart,
which took up two Months. This
slender Allowance did not proceed from
any Covetousness of the Ambassador, but
because we were obliged to manage our
Carriages to the best advantage. Besides
which, our ordinary Food was good Beef,
and sometimes Venison.</P>
<P>From the above-mentioned River
<HI>Schileka,</HI> we travelled three days together
through a great Forest full of Bogs, and
three days after through a Desart; and
further, two days again through a Forest,
before we reach'd the River <HI>Samur,</HI> which
falls into the River <HI>Schileka.</HI> In the night-time
we lodged in our Tents, of which
we had 50 in Number. There is other∣wise
no Travelling hereabouts with Wag∣gons,
but only with Camels and Horses.
For several days after we met with very
bad Ways, the Ground being very boggy
till you come to the River of <HI>Argun.</HI> At
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>
last we came on the 3<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>October</HI> to the
City of <HI>Argun,</HI> where we stay'd till the
7<SUP>th</SUP>, it being so long before our whole Ca∣ravan
could pass the River. This River
is at present the Boundary betwixt the
Emperors of <HI>Muscovy</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> this City
being the utmost Frontier place of the
Province of <HI>Dauri,</HI> as far as it is under the
Jurisdiction of the <HI>Muscovites.</HI> Some
years ago the Territories of the <HI>Czars</HI> of
<HI>Muscovy</HI> extended to the famous River of
<HI>Yamour,</HI> but these were by vertue of a
Treaty made in the Year 1689, (when
<HI>Fedor Alexievits</HI> was sent Ambassador to
<HI>China)</HI> betwixt both the Emperors, grant∣ed
to the <HI>Chineses,</HI> as was also the strong
Fortress of <HI>Albazin,</HI> situate upon the same
River.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mongul Tartars</HI> being always a∣broad
in Parties, we were obliged to be
continually upon our Guard, for fear of
our Baggage and Horses: These <HI>Monguls</HI>
are generally great Cowards, ten well
disciplin'd Men being able to beat a hun∣dred
of them.</P>
<P>The Ambassador dispatch'd from hence
some <HI>Cossacks</HI> to the before-mentioned Ci∣ty
of <HI>Naun,</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>China,</HI> to
desire the <HI>Chinese</HI> Governor to send us
some Carriages to a certain place. The
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>
best of our diversion was Hunting in the
Desart, where there was such vast Num∣bers
of Deer, that one night, when we
were drawing up our Waggons to make
our usual Fence, some Deer leapt among
us, of which we catch'd one with our
hands. The River <HI>Denbu,</HI> which exone∣rates
it self into the River <HI>Argun,</HI> is four
days Journey from the City of <HI>Argun.</HI></P>
<P>The 15<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>August</HI> we came to a large
Navigable River called <HI>Gaun,</HI> whose
Banks being overflown by the late Rains,
we could not pass with our Camels;
whereas at other times it is Fordable in
many places. Being unwilling to lose
time, we contrived a way to transport
our selves and the Caravan, by killing a
good many of our Oxen, the Hides of
which we joined together; and with what
Wood we could gather, we made a kind
of Floating-Boats for the conveniency of
Transportation. But the Hides were car∣ried
two Miles lower by the Current, and
were not brought on the other side with∣out
great danger. Our Floating-Bridges
succeeded better, which did us good ser∣vice:
The Horses being unloaded, were
forced to swim cross the River; We spent
two days in passing the River, and lost
but one Horse. On the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>August</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="37"/>
some <HI>Tongueses,</HI> who having surprized
some <HI>Monguls</HI> in their Habitations, and
after they had massacred 50 of them, had
carried the young ones into Slavery, of∣fered
us five of these Slaves, to wit, three
Boys and two Girls, whom they would
willingly have exchanged for Horses. We
could have bought them at the rate of 4
or 5 Rubles apiece; but the Ambassador
considering that we were entred the <HI>Chi∣nese</HI>
Territories, would not allow us to
buy any of them. On the 23<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>August</HI>
we reach'd the small River <HI>Keilar,</HI> which
falls into the River <HI>Arguin;</HI> we cross'd the
same River the next day on Horse-back.
The 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>August</HI> we cross'd again the
River <HI>Saduma,</HI> a small, but navigable Ri∣ver,
which likewise discharges it self into
the River <HI>Argun.</HI> The 27<SUP>th</SUP> we pass'd by
the River <HI>Gnar,</HI> which joins its Current
with the River <HI>Saduna;</HI> and on the 28<SUP>th</SUP>
we met a Caravan, consisting of 150 <HI>Rus∣sian</HI>
Merchants, and 300 Camels, but no
Horses. They had left <HI>Nartzinsko</HI> the last
Winter, in their Way to <HI>China,</HI> and were
now returning home. They brought us
the good News, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> ex∣pected
the Arrival of our Ambassador
with a great deal of impatience. We
tarried here two days, which time we
<PB N="66" REF="38"/>
spent together as merrily as the circum∣stances
of the Place would allow of; they
presented us with some Tea, which was
very welcome to us, who were grown
quite weary of drinking cold Water.</P>
<P>After we had taken our leave of one
another, we travelled for two days through
a Countrey, very agreeable for its pleasant
Hills and fertile Valleys, where the River
<HI>Iall</HI> has its rise, and afterwards becomes a
large navigable River. On the 31<SUP>st</SUP> of <HI>Au∣gust</HI>
our Messenger <HI>Kundikoff</HI> (whom the
Ambassador had dispatch'd from <HI>Iokutskoy</HI>
to <HI>Naun)</HI> returned and brought advice, that
a certain Person of Note, in the Quality of
an <HI>Adogeda</HI> (or Conductor of Ambassa∣dors)
was arrived from <HI>Peking</HI> to <HI>Naun,</HI>
where he expected the Arrival of the Am∣bassador.
On the 1<SUP>st</SUP> of <HI>September</HI> there
came a Messenger from the said <HI>Adogeda</HI>
to the Ambassador, who having compli∣mented
him in his Master's Name, brought
us the first <HI>Chinese</HI> Carriages, and a Present
of 10 Sheep, some Rice and Oatmeal, he
was sent back immediately.</P>
<P>On the 2<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>September</HI> we reach'd the
first Out-Guards (consisting of 12 persons)
of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> on the 3<SUP>d</SUP> we came to the
second, and on the 4<SUP>th</SUP> to the third. These
Scouts lay concealed upon the Hills, and
<PB N="67" REF="38"/>
as soon as they perceive any Caravans or
other Strangers coming that way, they give
notice to one another by certain Signals,
which reach to the Cities of <HI>China.</HI> For se∣veral
days together we travelled through
very pleasant Forests, where, among other
Trees, we found abundance of Oaks, which
were very low, but spread their Branches
in a very large Compass. We saw here al∣so
Filbird-trees in the Plains, differing in
shape from those we have in <HI>Europe,</HI> as be∣ing
not above half or three quarters of a
Yard high, and their Stalks very thin;
they bear a prodigious quantity of Nuts
of a very large size.</P>
<P>The next Place we came to, was inhabi∣ted
by the <HI>Targuts Chinay,</HI> who are Pagans,
subject to the <HI>Chineses;</HI> they are good Hus∣band-men,
the Countrey abounding in
Oats, Barley, Oatmeal and Tobacco; and
we being in want of some Oatmeal and
Salt, we furnished our selves with as much
as we stood in need of. These People live
on the utmost Confines of the Province of
<HI>Dauri;</HI> for that part of the Province which
is under the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Jurisdiction, extends
only to the River <HI>Argun,</HI> from whence to
the Village of <HI>Suttegarshe,</HI> all the rest be∣longs
to the <HI>Chineses,</HI> by vertue of the
above-mention'd Treaty. On the 10<SUP>th</SUP> of
<PB N="68" REF="39"/>
<HI>September</HI> several other Messengers arrived
from the <HI>Adogeda,</HI> who were sent back im∣mediately.
After we had travelled three
days longer through a Desart, we arrived
at last to the Village of <HI>Sutt<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ga,</HI> belonging
to the <HI>Chineses;</HI> where meeting with the
<HI>Adogeda,</HI> whose Attendance consisted of
50 persons, he invited us the same Evening
into his Tent, where he presented us with
some <HI>Thee</HI> boil'd in Milk, with Flower and
Butter, in wooden Dishes, and some Pre∣serves
and Sweet-meats. The 13<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Sep∣tember</HI>
the said <HI>Adogeda</HI> invited the Ambas∣sador,
with all his Retinue, to Dinner, where
he met the Ambassador at some distance
from his Tent, and after a very obliging
Salute conducted him with his left hand
thither. We stay'd about half an hour be∣fore
Dinner was brought in, which time
they bestow'd in entertaining one another
with several Questions: The <HI>Adogeda</HI> ask'd
the Ambassador, How long he had been
travelling from <HI>Musco</HI> to this place? Unto
which he reply'd, A year and a half. He
ask'd him further his Name; which he told
him was, <HI>Ilesar Ilesarevits Isbrand.</HI> Whilst
they passed their time in such-like discour∣ses,
Dinner was served up, upon a small
Table, without a Table-cloth, the Ambas∣sador
and the <HI>Adogeda</HI> having each his own
<PB N="69" REF="39"/>
Dish, as had all the rest: Our Dishes were
filled with Mutton and Pork; the second
Course was Pottage, wherein was a mix∣ture
of fine Flower, made in the nature of
a Pudding, but very long and thin, not un∣like
a Gut: We were put to a <HI>nonplus</HI> how
to manage this Dish; but two Secretaries
belonging to the <HI>Adogeda,</HI> who were much
better acquainted with it than we, shew'd
us the way. For, instead of Knives, they
had two Bonesticks; betwixt these they
took up these Puddings, which they thus
conveyed to their mouths, which they held
over the Dishes; and after they had bit off
a good mouthful, they let the rest drop in
the Dish again. These Sticks used by the
<HI>Chineses,</HI> in lieu of our Knives and Forks,
are streight, of about a quarter of a Yard
long, made either of Ebony-Wood, Bones
or Ivory, tipp'd on the end where they
touch the Victuals, with Gold or Silver,
which they use with a great deal of dexte∣rity,
without touching the Victuals with
their Fingers.</P>
<P>After Dinner two Silver Cups fill'd with
Brandy were brought to the <HI>Adogeda,</HI> one
of which he presented to the Ambassador,
the other he drunk himself. All the rest
had also Purcelain Cups with Brandy pre∣sented
them, which they were to take off
<PB N="70" REF="40"/>
to the bottom. The Feast concluded with
a Service of Sweetmeats in wooden Dishes.</P>
<P>The 14<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>September</HI> the Ambassador
invited the <HI>Adogeda</HI> to his Quarters, where
we observed, that our way of Entertaining
seem'd to them as strange as theirs had done
to us the day before.</P>
<P>After Dinner the Ambassador desir'd the
<HI>Adogeda</HI> to provide us the necessary Carri∣ages
and Passes, which he performed to our
satisfaction. The Ambassador had for his
daily allowance two Sheep; for each of his
Secretaries, one Sheep; for each of his Gen∣tlemen,
one Sheep; for the rest of his Atten∣dance,
some two, some three, some four to
a Sheep; for the <HI>Cossacks,</HI> Labourers and
Grooms, ten Men to a Sheep; for the ordi∣nary
Fellows, a Measure of Oatmeal each
a day; and for the better sort, a Paper with
Tea, which was a very plentiful Allow∣ance,
but that we wanted Bread, which is
a Commodity as little known among the
<HI>Chineses,</HI> as some other <HI>Asiaticks.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the City of <HI>Naun,</HI>
5 Miles distant from the Village of <HI>Sutti∣gatt,</HI>
are Idolaters, adoring the Devil in the
night-time, with most horrid Out-cries.
Their Houses are very commodious and
neat, their Livelihood being most Planting
of Tobacco. On the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>September</HI> the
<PB N="71" REF="40"/>
Ambassador sent to the <HI>Adogeda</HI> the follow∣ing
Presents:
<LIST>
<ITEM>10 Sables.</ITEM>
<ITEM>50 Ermins.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5 Yards of black Cloth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A looking-glass with a gilt Frame.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Another Looking-glass with a black
Frame.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Several Glass-bottles with <HI>Aquavitae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Some pieces of gilt Leather.</ITEM>
<ITEM>And several rare pieces made at <HI>Augs∣burgh,</HI>
that moved by the help of
Clock-work.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It was a great while before the <HI>Adogeda</HI>
could be prevailed upon to accept these
Presents, by reason they are under an obli∣gation
not to receive any Presents; for
which reason it is, that, when any Presents
are offered them, which they cannot in ho∣nour
refuse; they have them valued, and
are to return double the value of it to those
who presented them. On the 21<SUP>st</SUP> the <HI>Ado∣geda</HI>
sent to the Ambassador six Tables co∣vered
with Sweetmeats, and two Earthen
Bottles of <HI>Chinese</HI> Brandy. On the 23<SUP>d</SUP> he
invited the Ambassador to Dinner, and he
was invited by us again on the 24<SUP>th</SUP>.</P>
<P>Having thus diverted our selves for 14
days in the Village of <HI>Suttigett,</HI> in the
mean while that our Carriages were got
<PB N="72" REF="41"/>
ready, we continued our Journey on <HI>Mi∣chaelmas</HI>-day.
Each person of the first Rank
had a Waggon drawn by Oxen, and a Horse
allowed him. The rest of the Attendance
were provided with Waggons, three, four,
five and six in a Waggon; we came the
same night to a Village, where we took up
our Quarters, and the following night to
another, where we also stay'd all night,
after we had pass'd the day before through
a Desart.</P>
<P>It ought to be remembred here, to the
great Honour of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> that they
treat Strangers with a great deal of civility:
For, tho' we passed through uninhabitable
Desarts, yet did we never want Conveni∣encies
for Lodging; a sufficient number
of Cabans being brought from distant pla∣ces,
which were always ready provided a∣gainst
our Arrival. They were stor'd with
all necessary Utensils for the Kitchen, and
each Hutt had a Servant, whose Business
was to take care of the Fuel, Water, and
other Necessaries. Every other day we had
fresh Horses ready at hand, and the <HI>Chi∣neses</HI>
kept all night a constant Guard round
our Waggon fence, to prevent any surprize;
they were provided with Bells, to give the
Alarm to one another in case of necessity.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="41"/>
The <HI>Adogeda</HI> keeping constant Compa∣ny
with our Ambassador during the whole
Journey, they often fell in discourse toge∣ther
concerning the Nature and Policy of
several Nations, which commonly ended
in the Praise of <HI>China,</HI> of which the <HI>Ado∣geda,</HI>
but especially of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Wall,
(round which he told us, a Man could not
travel in three years time) related us such
Wonders, that we could not but be surpri∣zed
at it. Nothing was so troublesome to
us in this Desart, as the want of fresh Wa∣ter,
which we were forced to dig for very
deep, and was commonly so muddy, that
it went against our stomachs. If we met
with any that was tolerably good, we took
care to carry some of it along with us in
Leathern Flasks. Our best comfort was,
that the Ambassador had every Morning
a small Kettle-full of boil'd Tea allowed
him for his Breakfast, of which some of us
had our share, which was served us in Ca∣bans
or Hutts set up for that purpose, at
certain distances. We often used to divert
our selves with Hunting, these Desarts be∣ing
full of all sorts of very good Game. I
and another, a particular Friend of mine,
rid out one Morning a Hunting, to shoot
some wild Sheep, but paid dearly for it; for
having lost our Caravan, we rid two days
<PB N="74" REF="42"/>
and nights up and down the Desart, not
knowing where we were, till at last we
came in sight of some Hutts belonging to
the <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI> but durst not approach
for fear of being assassinated by them. But
they having espied us at a distance, came
up with us, inviting us to their Cabans,
where, beyond all expectation, they treated
us very civilly: It is possible they had
heard of our Ambassadors coming that
way, and judged that we belonged to his
Retinue. Our greatest Trouble was how
to find out means to send to the Ambassa∣dor,
who had sent several of his Men in
quest of us: We made them at last under∣stand
by many signs who we were, and
what our Errand was with the Ambassa∣dor;
upon which they sent a Messenger
to give him notice where we were: It is
easy to be imagined that we were very ea∣ger
of going along with the Messenger;
but our Horses being quite tired, we were
forced to tarry there till our Caravan came
by that way.</P>
<P>On the 15<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October</HI> we arrived near
the River <HI>Casumur,</HI> which exonerates it
self in the River <HI>Naun,</HI> where we halted
24 hours, and refresh'd our selves with fair
Water, which was as welcome to us as if
it had been the best Wine, because we had
<PB N="75" REF="42"/>
been in great want of it before. Having
provided our selves with as much as our
Leathern Vessels would hold, we continu∣ed
our Journey, and on the 19<SUP>th</SUP> passed by
the Ruins of several Cities, where we ob∣served
the Remnants of very ancient stone
Monuments, representing several Figures,
quite different from those we meet with in
<HI>Europe.</HI> They say that these Places were
destroyed by <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI> We saw
also hereabouts several large stone Pillars of
an excessive bigness, which being hung a∣bout
with small Bells, made a great noise
when they were put in motion by the Wind.
Beyond these we saw again the Ruins of
several Places, and several Figures cut in
Stone, representing Men, Women, and se∣veral
sorts of Beasts. Deer, Hares, and wild
Sheep we meet in vast numbers, of the last
we saw sometimes 2 or 300 together; but
they are very difficult to be catch'd, they
being nimbler than a Deer. The Hares
are hereabouts very small, not much bigger
than our Leverets. Pheasants are also here
in great quantities, but not easily to be
reach'd by the Gun, for they don't settle
upon the Trees, but run all along upon the
Ground, swifter than other Birds can fly in
the Air. We took a great deal of delight
in the dexterity of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who with
<PB N="76" REF="43"/>
their Arrows would shoot any Bird flying.
The <HI>Adogeda</HI> had very fine Falcons, who
seldom let escape any Pheasant or Hare
they met with.</P>
<P>The nearer we approached the <HI>Chinese</HI>
Wall, the more populous we found the
Country: For three days together, before
we came in sight of it, we travelled all o∣ver
Rocks and Precipices, through which
there was cut a safe Road for the conveni∣ency
of Travellers; and in the midst of
these Rocks there is a goodly City, called
by the <HI>Russians, Schoma Gorod,</HI> or <HI>Kora Ka∣ton.</HI>
All hereabouts are abundance of Ti∣gers,
Leopards, and Panthers, for which
reason the Ambassador, upon the persua∣sion
of the <HI>Adogeda,</HI> ordered that no body
should ride at any distance from the Cara∣van,
unless there were at least three or
more in Company. In the City of <HI>Kara∣katon</HI>
some Alterations were made in our
Provisions by the <HI>Chineses;</HI> for, instead of
Sheep we had Hogs allowed us, and a
Measure of Rice for each person. The
Hogs in <HI>China</HI> have such hanging Bellies,
that they touch the Ground.</P>
<P>From hence we had a long days Journey
to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Wall, betwixt <HI>Rich,</HI> and the
City of <HI>Naun;</HI> the Country is inhabited by
the <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI> who acknowledge the
<PB N="77" REF="43"/>
<HI>Dalaclama</HI> for their Head. They keep their
Idols in their Houses, and present their Of∣ferings
to them, which is commonly Victu∣als
and Drink. When they bury their Dead,
they put a white Cock upon the Coffin.
A <HI>Mongul</HI> Nun, who was continually mut∣tering
her Prayers with her Beads in her
hands, being asked by the Ambassador,
who it was she adored, she gave for an∣swer,
<HI>I adore the same God, who being de∣prived
of Heaven by your God, will certainly
return thither, and put your God out of his
place; when you will see strange Alterations
upon Earth.</HI></P>
<P>On the 27<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> towards Even∣ing,
we came in sight of the famous <HI>Chi∣nese</HI>
Wall, which is four Fathoms high, and
of such thickness that eight persons may
ride upon it a-breast. It is 1500 <HI>English</HI>
Miles long in a straight Line; for if you
will count the Hills and vast Mountains
upon which it is built in some Places, it
would amount at least to 500 more. At
each Miles distance there is a Tower. At
the first Gate we entred, the Wall appear'd
to be much decay'd; but at a Musket-shot
from thence we passed through ano∣ther
Gate, which resembled a large Basti∣on.
We were conducted through two
more, and those three last enclosed a large
<PB N="78" REF="44"/>
place with their Walls, the three Gates ser∣ving
for as many Bastions. Upon the first
Wall we saw a very large <HI>Corps de Guards,</HI>
where, as they told us, there was kept a
constant Guard. At some distance from the
first Wall without the Gate, there was also
a Watch kept, consisting only of 20 Soldi∣ers.
About a Mile within the Wall we pas∣sed
by to the left of us the City of <HI>Galgan,</HI>
which is surrounded with a very fine stone
Wall. Near this Place we met with the
first <HI>Chinese</HI> Idols. It is to be admired what
vast Numbers of Temples the <HI>Chineses</HI> have
dedicated to their Idols, all their Cities and
Villages are full of them, nay you meet
with them upon unaccessible Mountains;
they shew very well at a distance. But as
to the Figures of their Idols, they are so
dreadful as if they had been contrived on
purpose to strike Terror into the Beholders.
They are made either of Wood or Clay,
and are sometimes gilt. In all their Tem∣ples
you meet with a certain Idol, which
being of a terrible aspect, holds a Scepter
in his hand, him they call the <HI>God of War,</HI>
and pay a great deal of Veneration to him.
This God is surrounded with Drums of all
sizes, which are beaten whilst they are at
their Devotion.</P>
<P>We were Quartered in the Suburbs, and
<PB N="79" REF="44"/>
at our arrival were met by their Pipers and
others who play'd upon Cymbals, and beat
the Drums, but made a very doleful noise.
The <HI>Adogeda</HI> invited us to Supper, where
we were very well entertain'd, and were
treated with <HI>Tarrasun,</HI> a Liquor made of
Rice. After Supper the <HI>Adogeda</HI> diverted
us with a Play, or rather Farce, acted by
the Players that were sent from <HI>Peking</HI> to
meet him. What was most remarkable was,
that they acted the Mimicks to the life, and
changed their Postures and Cloaths, which
were extraordinary Magnificent, frequent∣ly
to our great astonishment. On the 28<SUP>th</SUP>
of <HI>October</HI> we passed by another <HI>Chinese</HI> Ci∣ty,
and towards Evening arrived in the Ci∣ty
of <HI>Xantuning,</HI> where the Ambassador
was entertained by the Governor with a
magnificent Feast, and another Play. All
the Apartments were hung with very rich
Tapistry, and the whole Entertainment
was very noble. The Ambassador, the Go∣vernor
and the <HI>Adogeda,</HI> were plac'd each
on a Table by themselves, but we were all
put together on one Table. The dishes
were brought in one after another, but
none taken away till after the Feast was
ended. There were in all eight Courses,
and as often as a dish (which were all of
Purcelain) was brought in, the Clerk of the
<PB N="80" REF="45"/>
Kitchen led the way, admonishing the
Guests to eat heartily. At the beginning
of the Feast, the <HI>Adogeda</HI> putting out his
Sticks, show'd them to the Ambassador as
a Signal, that we should follow his Exam∣ple.
Before Dinner we were entertained by
a Boy of 10 years of age, who very natu∣rally
acted the Mimick, and made strange
Postures upon the Ground, which was co∣vered
with Tapestry: Which done, seven
Purcelain Cups were placed upon a Table,
which he took up backwards with his
mouth; which he repeated afterwards,
holding his hands upon his back. This was
followed by an Entry, where a Man and a
Woman acted the Lovers, and, to conclude
the matter, a Man dressed up in a Tigers
Skin pass'd through the Room upon all-fours,
to the no small astonishment of those
who were ignorant of the contrivance.
The Feast lasted above three hours, and the
<HI>Adogeda</HI> desiring the Ambassador to take a
Walk with him, they were just going to
take their leave, when one of the <HI>Adogeda</HI>'s
Servants whispering his Master, that the
After-course was going to be served up,
they changed their Resolution, and stay'd
near two hours longer; during which time
they were again diverted by the Players,
who changed their Cloaths 8 or 10 times.
<PB N="81" REF="45"/>
The 29<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October</HI> we came in sight of the
City of <HI>Xunguxu;</HI> in this as well as in all other
Cities where we pass'd, the Ambassador was
treated with all imaginable Respect and Civi∣lity.
We were again entertain'd in this City
with a Play, in a Play-house fitted up for that
purpose. In one of their Temples there, we
saw a Goddess, which being of Stone 128 Feet
high, had 700 Hands. I had often the curio∣sity
to enter their Temples, and to take a view
of their Idols, who are of very different shapes
and figures, and very terrible to behold, but
most magnificently dress'd. Near this Place
there is a famous Pagan Temple built upon
a very high Rock, near the Monastery of <HI>Iu∣gangu.</HI></P>
<P>On the 30<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> as we were travel∣ling
upon the Road, we met a great Num∣ber
of Men and Women, who followed an
Idol carried by two Men, and play'd merrily
upon their Pipes, Cymbals and Drums. The
Ambassador asked the <HI>Adogeda,</HI> What the
meaning was of this Procession? To which he
answer'd, That they were going to a neigh∣bouring
Temple to perform their Devotion.</P>
<P>The same day we pass'd in sight of a goodly
Place, called the <HI>Red City,</HI> the Residence of the
Sister of the <HI>Bogdegan,</HI> and famous for the
Tombs of several <HI>Chans.</HI> This City lies near
the <HI>Chinese</HI> Wall; we were fain to take up
our Lodgings that night in a Village. Early
<PB N="82" REF="46"/>
the next morning the <HI>Adogeda</HI> sent word to
the Ambassador, that, having some business
of moment to dispatch, he begg'd his pardon
that he could not wait upon him immediate∣ly,
but that if he would be pleased to go be∣fore,
he would follow him as soon as possibly
he could. We had scarce rid three or four
hours, when the <HI>Adogeda</HI>'s Steward overtook
us near one of their Temples, desiring us to
tarry a little in this place, his Master being
upon the Road to overtake us. We took this
opportunity to take a view of the Temple,
where meeting with three more of the <HI>Ado∣geda</HI>'s
Servants, we saw them prostrate them∣selves
first before the Idol that stood in the
middle of the Temple, and afterwards to per∣form
the same Ceremony to two others that
stood on both sides of it. Towards noon we
got to the City of <HI>Xangote,</HI> where having
been entertained with a very handsome din∣ner
by the Governor, we continued our Jour∣ney,
and took up our nights Lodging in a
Countrey Town. The first of <HI>November</HI> the
Ambassador was again treated at dinner by
a Governor of another City, and was Quar∣tered
also in another Countrey Town at
night.</P>
<P>All the way as we passed along the Roads
we met with such a prodigious Number of
most magnificent Temples, that we could not
but admire at the ignorance of these peo∣ple,
<PB N="83" REF="46"/>
who shew so much Veneration to these
Idols.</P>
<P>The 2<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>November</HI> we came to the great
and famous City of <HI>Tunxo,</HI> situate on a Ri∣ver,
where the Ambassador was invited also
to dinner by the Governor, who conducted
us afterwards out of the Town. That night
we were Quartered in the next Town to the
City of <HI>Peking.</HI> The City of <HI>Tukxe</HI> is fa∣mous
for its, Traffick in Purcelain, which is
sold here much cheaper than in <HI>Peking.</HI> The
<HI>Chinese</HI> have a way of Pleating their Sails
together in a very small Compass.</P>
<P>On the 3<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>November,</HI> towards noon,
we made a publick Entry in the Capital Ci∣ty
of <HI>Peking,</HI> in very good Order and great
Splendor, the Streets being crowded with
vast Numbers of Spectators on both sides of
the way, which raised such a dust, that we
scarce could see one another: We had our
Lodgings assigned us in the Court, which is
the ordinary Residence of Foreign Ambas∣sadors.</P>
<P>On the 12<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>November</HI> the <HI>Adagada</HI>
and his <HI>Tawares</HI> or Associate, waited upon
the Ambassador, to give him notice that he
was to be admitted to his publick Audience
the next day, and to be conducted thither
by 30 Horses, desiring him to get his Cre∣dentials
and the Presents ready against that
time. He asked the Ambassador who was
<PB N="84" REF="47"/>
to carry the Presents? and being answered,
That this was to be performed by the <HI>Cos∣sacks,</HI>
he shew'd his dislike, desiring that it
might be done by some of his Retinue;
which the Ambassador refused, telling him,
That when they were carried to the place
where they were to be delivered, he would
do it with his own hands, wherewith he
was very well satisfied, desiring only, that
they might be conveyed with good Cou∣verts.
Matters being thus settled, the Am∣bassador
drank to him a Glass of <HI>Spanish</HI>
Wine, to the Health of the <HI>Dorgamba;</HI> who
being one of the first Men of the Empire,
he took it off to the bottom; whereas before
this time, we could never persuade any of
them to pledge us, they being a very ob∣stinate
people, and very noisy with their
Tongues, if not gratified in their desires.</P>
<P>It was the 14<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>November</HI> before the
Ambassador could be in readiness to deliver
his Credentials, when we were conducted
to Court in the following manner: 15 <HI>Cos∣sacks,</HI>
who carried the Presents, led the Van;
these were followed by one of the Masters of
the Jewel-Office belonging to the <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Muscovy.</HI> After him the Secretary of the Em∣bassy,
who carried the Credentials After him
came the Ambassador betwixt the two <HI>Ado∣geda's;</HI>
and lastly, the rest of the Gentlemen
belonging to the Ambassador.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="47"/>
At the Entrance of the Castle, we did
alight from our Horses, and marched on
foot through a long Gate, arch'd on the
top. Before we entred the second Gate,
we pass'd over a very fine Stone-Bridge,
about 50 or 60 Paces long, on both sides
of which we took notice of a Wall about
three foot high, with many Figures cut
in Stone. Within the Gate we were
conducted through a very spacious Court,
where we saw two large Pillars, very ar∣tificially
wrought with variety of Figures.
From thence we went into a very fine
Hall, where we found two Tables. No
sooner were we entred there, but the
<HI>Adogeda</HI> desir'd the Ambassador to sit
down upon the Ground upon such Bolsters
as were brought thither for that purpose;
and soon after we saw four Lords, who
are the Chiefest of the whole Empire, to
enter the Room before the <HI>Bogdegan</HI> him∣self.
These four were the <HI>Dorgamba,</HI> the
<HI>Askamba,</HI> the <HI>Aligamba,</HI> and the <HI>Adogam∣ba.</HI>
After the Credentials were deliver∣ed
to the King himself, the Presents were
given to the <HI>Adogeda,</HI> who laid them up∣on
the two Tables. Which done; the
<HI>Dorgamba,</HI> with the other three Lords,
came up to the Ambassador, and after
having made their Compliments, and
<PB N="82" REF="48"/>
given him each both their Hands, the
<HI>Dorgamba,</HI> after his congratulatory Speech
upon our happy arrival, enquir'd after
Health of both their <HI>Czarish Majesties,</HI>
telling him, that his Credentials should be
forthwith translated, and he to receive an
Answer to the same. After which, he
told him what allowance was to be given
to himself and his Retinue; to wit: eve∣ry
day for the Ambassador himself, two
Sheep, one Goose, three Pullets, three
Fish, a large measure of Flower, a large
measure of Rice, two Pound of Butter,
two Papers of <HI>Thee,</HI> Salt, and other
Things proportionable, besides two Gal∣lons
of <HI>Tarrasun.</HI> The rest of his Re∣tinue
and other Servants, had the same
Allowance as before, with some addition
of Flower, Butter and <HI>Tarrasun.</HI></P>
<P>The Ambassador being reconducted to
his Quarters by the two <HI>Adogeda's,</HI> scarce
three hours were pass'd, before the young∣est
of the two <HI>Adogeda's</HI> brought word,
that the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Letters had been receiv'd
with a great deal of Satisfaction, desiring
him in the <HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s Name, to come
and take a share, with all his Retinue of
his own Table. As they were going a∣long
the Streets to Court on Horse-back,
the <HI>Adogeda</HI> told the Ambassdor, that he
<PB N="83" REF="48"/>
ought to look upon this Invitation as a
most particular Grace, it being not custo∣mary
for Ambassdors to receive this Ho∣nour
immediately after the delivery of
their Credentials.</P>
<P>Being entred the same Hall where the
Credentials had been deliver'd before,
the <HI>Adogeda</HI> invited the Ambassador to sit
down, and soon after entred the same
four Lords before the <HI>Bogdegan,</HI> and sa∣luted
the Ambassador very obligingly.
Immediately after, four Tables were
brought into the Room, two of which
were cover'd with forty Silver Dishes,
full of all Sorts of Sweet-Meats, for the
Amhassador, the other two (where there
were also some Sweet-Meats, and a Dish
with boil'd cold Mutton) fell to our
share. After Dinner, we were treated
with <HI>Thee</HI> boil'd in Milk, in wooden Dish∣es,
which we took, and re-delivered to
the Servants, with making deep Reve∣ences.
So soon as the Ambassador arose
from the Table, all his Sweet-Meats were
given to his Attendants; but what was
left upon our Tables, was divided among
the <HI>Cosacks.</HI></P>
<P>The 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>November,</HI> the <HI>Dorgam∣ba,</HI>
with several other <HI>Chinese</HI> Lords, and
the two <HI>Adogeda's,</HI> came to pay a Visit to
<PB N="84" REF="49"/>
the Ambassador; who entertain'd them
with a Sett of very good Musick, at
which they seem'd to be extreamly well
satisfied; and after they had staid some
time, the Ambassador made to the <HI>Dor∣gamba</HI>
these following Presents.</P>
<P>A large Looking-Glass with a black
wooden Frame. A less Looking-Glass.</P>
<P>A round Looking-Glass with a gilt
Frame. Two Watches.</P>
<P>Twenty pieces of gilt Leather.</P>
<P>Several fine Cuts.</P>
<P>Six very fine Crystal-Glasses.</P>
<P>A large Case for Glasses.</P>
<P>Three large Dogs spotted like Tygers.</P>
<P>A fine black Gun-Dog.</P>
<P>A piece of fine Hollin Linen-Cloth.</P>
<P>Four Lac'd Handkerchiefs;</P>
<P>Besides some Sables, black Foxes, Er∣mins,
and other <HI>Siberian</HI> Commodities,
which were received in a most obliging
manner by the <HI>Dorgamba.</HI> On the 17<SUP>th</SUP>
of <HI>November,</HI> two Heralds at Arms, were
sent to invite the Ambassador and four∣teen
of the Gentlemen of his Retinue,
to the <HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s Table; and we were
not a Musket-shot from our Quarters, be∣fore
we were met by the <HI>Adogeda's,</HI> who
conducted us into the Castle. Being en∣tred
the same Hall, where we had deliver'd
<PB N="85" REF="49"/>
our Credentials before. The <HI>Adogeda</HI>
presented the Ambassador and his Retinue,
with Chairs; immediately after, came
the four abovementioned Lords, who af∣ter
having paid their Complements to the
Ambassador, asked him, whether he could
speak <HI>Latin;</HI> and being answer'd, he did
not: they asked further, whether any of
his Retinue were Masters of the said
Language; and it being told him, that
there was one who had some Knowledge
of it, but not to perfection; they left us
to return our Answer to the <HI>Bogdegan.</HI>
We sat above four or five hours before
word was brought us, that we were to
come to the <HI>Bogdegan;</HI> but were in the
mean while treated with <HI>Thee</HI> boil'd in
Milk by the <HI>Adogeda.</HI> An account was
likewise taken of our Names, how many
there were of us; which done, the <HI>Ado∣geda</HI>
receiv'd Orders to conduct us. We
pass'd through three several Gates, and as
many large and handsome Courts; among
which, one deserves to be particularly
taken notice of. For in the midst of it,
there was a Bridge of Marble, sustain'd
by very fine Arches; under which was a
Water, which being call'd, the <HI>Bogdegan's
Fish-Pond,</HI> had the resemblance of a fair
small River, and surrounded the Castle.
<PB N="86" REF="50"/>
So soon as we entred the Room, where
the <HI>Bogdegan</HI> was seated upon his Throne,
the Ambassador was plac'd by the <HI>Adoge∣da's</HI>
on one side of the Throne, which was
surrounded with above three hundred
Courtiers, who all wore the Emperour's
Armes upon their Breasts and Backs. The
Roof of this Room was extraordinary
high, and the sides adorn'd with a great
number of Marble Statues. Just oppo∣site
to it was the Emperour's Temple, a
most magnificent Structure. On the o∣ther
side of the Room, you look'd into an∣other
Court, where were the Lodgings
of the Enuchs and other Women, that
attended in the Emperour's <HI>Seraglio.</HI> The
Ambassador was placed on the left-hand
of the Throne, and his Attendance about
four Rods behind him, on the right-hand;
just opposite to the Ambassadors were the
four abovementioned Lords; About forty
Persons, armed with Half-Pikes and Bat∣tle-Axes
attended about the Throne.
We had not sat very long, before we
saw a Table cover'd all over with Dishes
of Massive Gold, and fill'd with Sweet-Meats
brought in, which was set before
the Emperour; After this, two Tables with
Sweet-Meats were brought in for the four
Lords; and next to them, another Table
<PB N="87" REF="50"/>
with Sweet-Meats for the Ambassador;
several Tables were placed for us, three
belonging to a Table; The Sweet-Meats
were all serv'd in Silver Dishes; besides
which there were Grapes, Apples, Pears,
Chesnuts, China-Oranges, Citrons, and
other Fruits. As for the <HI>Chineses,</HI> of
whom there were above a hundred, each
had his own Table, with several Dishes
of Meat.</P>
<P>So soon as we saw the Emperour be∣gin
to eat, we were obliged to pay our
Reverence by a low inclination of the
Head, and then we eat of what was be∣fore
us. After Dinner, which lasted a∣bove
three hours, two large Cups of
Brandy were presented to the <HI>Bogdegan,</HI>
who ordered the <HI>Dorgamba</HI> and another
Great Lord, to conduct the Ambassador
upon the Throne; Being advanc'd upon
the Steps, the <HI>Dorgamba,</HI> by orders from
the Emperour, presented one of these
Cups to the Ambassador, telling him, that
he must make a low Reverence, and
drink it all off at a Draught.</P>
<P>In the mean while, some <HI>Iesuits</HI> having
been sent for, they appear'd instantly,
and by Orders from the Emperour, spoke
to the Ambassador in <HI>Latin;</HI> who an∣swering
them in <HI>Italian,</HI> that he was not
<PB N="88" REF="51"/>
very well vers'd in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue,
one of the Fathers began to talk in <HI>Itali∣an</HI>
with the Ambassador, whom he ask∣ed
many Questions, and among the rest,
How long it was since he left <HI>Muscovy?</HI>
Unto which he having given a suitable
Answer, he was re-conducted to his place.
We were also each in his turn, placed op∣posite
to the Throne, and presented with
a golden Cup of Brandy, which after we
had taken up, with a very low Reverence,
we were re-conducted to our respective
places. Soon after we as well as the <HI>Chi∣neses</HI>
there present, had some <HI>Thee</HI> boil'd in
Milk presented to us in wooden Dishes,
which as before we received, and return'd
with a very low bow to the very ground.
The Tables being remov'd, we were con∣ducted
out of the Room, which done,
both the <HI>Adogeda's</HI> made a sign to the
Ambassador to follow them into another
Apartment, which was done, because we
should not see the <HI>Bogdegan</HI> descend from
his Throne. He is originally a <HI>Mongul
Tartar,</HI> of a brown Complexion, of a∣bout
45 years of Age.</P>
<P>The Ambassador desir'd to be dismiss'd
for that time, but the <HI>Dorgamba</HI> return'd
from the Emperour, and asked the Am∣bassador,
whether he could tell any tidings
<PB N="89" REF="51"/>
concerning some <HI>Iesuits,</HI> who about three
years before intended to travel to <HI>China,</HI>
by the way of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> but were stopt
in their Journey? The Ambassador hav∣ing
answer'd that he knew nothing of
them, the <HI>Dorgamba</HI> return'd with this
Answer to the Emperour. In the mean
while we were conducted to our former
places, where the <HI>Adogeda</HI> desir'd the
Ambassador to sit down a little, till the
Sweet-Meats that were left, could be
given to our Servants; which was done
accordingly; it being a very antient Cu∣stom
among the <HI>Chineses,</HI> always to let
the Remnants of the Emperour's Table
to be carried home. Our Servants being
well loaden with Sweet-Meats, the two
<HI>Adogeda's</HI> reconducted the Ambassador to
his Quarters.</P>
<P>On the 18th of <HI>November,</HI> we as well
as the <HI>Cosacks</HI> were entertain'd at our
Quarters from the Emperour's Table.
There was a Table in the Ambassador's
Appartment for his own use, those for
the Gentlemen was laid in the Hall. All
the Tables being cover'd with Meats, two
of the <HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s Courtiers came to de∣sire
the Ambassador and his Retinue in
the Emperour's Name to sit down, which
we did with a profound Reverence, in
<PB N="90" REF="52"/>
respect to his Imperial Majesty. Our
Dishes were, boil'd Geese, Pullets, Eggs,
and all sorts of Meats; Grapes, Apples,
Pears, Wall-nuts, Chesnuts, Citrons,
China-Oranges, all sorts of Preserves and
Sweet-Meats. The <HI>Cosacks</HI> din'd in the
Court; and before Dinner, were all pre∣sented
with <HI>Thee</HI> boil'd in Milk. Towards
Evening the two <HI>Adogeda's</HI> came to tell
the Ambassador, that the <HI>Bogdegan</HI> was
going to make a Progress for 20 days; and
on the 7th of <HI>December,</HI> they came to
give us notice of his return to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>On the 8th we were again invited to
the <HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s Table, where we were
treated in the same manner as before. On
the 11th the <HI>Askamba</HI> and <HI>Surgushey,</HI>
were sent by the <HI>Bogdegan,</HI> to invite the
Ambassador and his Retinue to be present
at a great Feast at Court, and to be con∣ducted
through the left-side of the Castle,
whereas before, we had been brought in
through the Great Court on the right∣side.</P>
<P>Accordingly next Morning, five hours
before day-light, the two <HI>Adogeda's</HI> came
to our Quarters, and conducted us on
Horse-back to the Castle, where being
entred on the left-side, the <HI>Adogeda's</HI> de∣sired
the Ambassador to sit down, where
<PB N="91" REF="52"/>
we were treated several times with <HI>Thee;</HI>
in the mean while that one of the <HI>Ado∣geda's</HI>
was gone to receive his further In∣structions.
At break of day, both the
<HI>Adogeda's</HI> led us into a Court, where we
saw two Elephants of an extraordinary
bigness, with very rich Furnitures: Op∣posite
to them, we saw a great many
Drums plac'd upon the Ground, near
which stood the Emperour's Guards,
cloath'd in red Damask, and all round the
Court we saw above a hundred Chairs,
belonging to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Lords. Being
from thence conducted to the place where
the <HI>Bogdegan</HI> was to make his Appearance,
we entred on the left-side, where we saw
several hundreds <HI>Chinese</HI> Lords very mag∣nificently
dress'd, with the Emperour's
Armes upon their Backs and Breasts, sit∣ting
upon Bolsters or Cushions, upon the
ground. Their Caps were adorn'd with
the Feathers of Peacocks, which were
fastn'd to them with fine Crystals. Those
of the first Rank had very large Saphirs
upon their Caps. Near to these we had
our Seats assign'd us; and scarce had we
thus sat an hour, when by the discharge
of a Cannon (which made no great
noise) a signal was given for the <HI>Chi∣neses</HI>
to rise, whilst the <HI>Bogdegan</HI> was
<PB N="92" REF="53"/>
coming in to mount his Throne, which
stood directly opposite to the Door, thro'
which we were introduc'd. All on a sud∣den
we heard a Chime of Bells, which
being the signal for the <HI>Chineses,</HI> they in
very good Order made their appearance
before the <HI>Bogdegan:</HI> In the mean while,
a certain Person who stood near the <HI>Bog∣degan,</HI>
read for above an hour with a very
loud and audible Voice out of a Book,
which done, we heard very fine singing
at some distance from us; After this two
Drums were beat, which being another
signal to the <HI>Chineses,</HI> they fell upon their
Knees, bending their Heads to the ground,
three times, one after another. Then
they rise, and several Musical Instruments
made an agreeable Harmony for some
time, during which they performed the
same reverence twice more, and so took
their Seats again. We were then con∣ducted
by the two <HI>Adogedan's</HI> in the pre∣sence
of the <HI>Bogdean,</HI> where we perform∣ed
the same Ceremony in the same man∣ner
as the <HI>Chineses</HI> had done; And the
Ambassador being led by the Hand by the
<HI>Adogeda</HI> up to the <HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s Throne, had
the honour to receive a dish of <HI>Thee</HI> from
the <HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s own hands. We were
likewise, after we had taken our Seats,
<PB N="93" REF="53"/>
again treated with <HI>Thee</HI> boil'd in Milk,
being obliged every time we took and
re delivered the Cup, to turn our left-Leg
under our Bodies, and so to make a
low Inclination with our Heads. Soon
after, the Ambassador being re-conduct∣ed
by the <HI>Adogeda</HI> to his Seat, the <HI>Chine∣ses,</HI>
all on a sudden, plac'd themselves on
the right-side upon their bended Knees,
knocking their Heads against the Ground
three times, whilst the <HI>Bogdegan</HI> was de∣scending
from the Throne. We were
led by the two <HI>Adogeda's</HI> to the same place,
where we were obliged to perform the
same Ceremony. That part of the Court
where the <HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s Throne was plac'd,
was lin'd with his Guards, cloath'd in
red Damask, and arm'd with Battle-Axes
and Half-Piques. The Solemnity being
ended, we pass'd again through the place
where before we had deliver'd our Cre∣dentials,
in order to our return to our
Quarters; but the <HI>Adogeda's</HI> desiring the
Ambassador to stay a little longer, there
being some <HI>Chinese</HI> Lords, who were ve∣ry
ambitious to see the Ambassador and
his Retinue, he granted his request. As
we were coming out of the Castle, we
saw one of the Elephants, which was
shewn us before, draw a great Waggon,
<PB N="94" REF="54"/>
in which was the <HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s Throne; we
were scarce return'd to our Quarters, when
the <HI>Adogeda</HI> again entreated the Ambassa∣dor
to go along with him to the <HI>Bogde∣gan</HI>'s
Play-house, vvhere a very diverting
Play vvas acted that day. He invited
not only the Ambassador's Retinue, but
also all the Merchants and <HI>Cosacks,</HI> to
partake of the Shovv. And as vve vvere
on our way thither, we met several <HI>Chi∣nese</HI>
Lords, among whom was the <HI>As∣kamba,</HI>
who came on purpose to bear the
Ambassador Company thither. Before
Dinner we had the diversion of seeing a
Fellow play all sorts of Tricks. He took
a stick, which was sharp at one end in his
Hand, on which he fixed a large round
wooden Ball, which turn'd it self with∣out
intermission upon the Stick, till he
threw it in the Air, and catch'd it again
upon the point of the Stick, where it
rowl'd about like before; Secondly, he
took another Stick, but not so big as the
former, which he fixed upon his upper
Lip; in the middle of this Stick was a
small wooden Horse, which continually
turn'd about the Stick, as did another
wooden Ball on the top of the Stick.
Sometimes he put the Stick upon his
Thumb, where it perform'd the same o∣peration.
<PB N="95" REF="54"/>
Thirdly, he put the same Stick
through a certain Instrument, not unlike
our Flutes, which he held in his Mouth.
On the point of the Stick he had fixed
two Knives, not unlike our Shoe-maker's
Knives, with their Edges to one another,
which turn'd themselves upon the Stick to
the no small astonishment of the Specta∣tors.
Fourthly, he took three ordinary
Knives, two of which he kept steady in
his left-hand, but no sooner had he thrown
the third up in the Air, but the other two
follow'd, which he catch'd all three by
the Handles. He shew'd us also several
fine Postures on Horse-back, and whilst
we were very magnificently treated at
Dinner, we had the diversion of the
Play, which lasted till night; when we
return'd home well satisfied with our En∣tertainment.</P>
<P>The 18th of <HI>December,</HI> hoth the <HI>Ado∣geda's</HI>
came to salute the Ambassador in
the Name of the <HI>Dorgamba,</HI> and to in∣vite
him and the Chiefest of his Dome∣sticks
to pass the next day at his House.
The next Morning his Horses stood ready
to attend us at our Quarters, from whence
we went directly to the <HI>Dorgamba</HI>'s
Palace. We were conducted by the <HI>A∣dogeda's</HI>
in a small appartment, where
<PB N="96" REF="55"/>
we found the <HI>Dorgamba</HI> ready to receive
the Ambassador, which he did in very obli∣ging
terms. Soon after we were treated
with <HI>Thee</HI> boil'd in Milk, and the Am∣bassador
having communicated for some
time with the <HI>Dorgamba,</HI> concerning the
Instructions, he had received from their
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's, the Ambassador was
conducted from thence into the Dining-Room.
As we entred the Room, the
Players who were very magnificently
dress'd, stood ready to begin the Play,
which they did accordingly; It is the Cu∣stom
in <HI>China</HI> for the Actors to give a
Book, containing the Contents of many
Plays, to the Master of the Feasts, out of
which he chuses which he likes best,
which is commonly perform'd by sing∣ing
in the nature of our <HI>Opera's.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dorgamba</HI> sat at a Table by himself,
next to him was plac'd the Ambassador at
another Table, and next to him the two
<HI>Adogeda's</HI> at another. Two other Tables
were brought in for the Ambassador's
Retinue; we were treated with great
deal of Splendor. Our Drink was <HI>Aqua
vitae</HI> prepared with Cinnamon, which was
brought to us in golden Cups, and we
were forced to take it off quite to the bot∣tom,
the <HI>Dorgamba</HI> shewing us the way
<PB N="97" REF="55"/>
by his own Example. The Floor was
covered all over with Tapistry, and be∣hind
the <HI>Dorgamba</HI> stood a little Page
with a Basket made of Straw-work, which
was the <HI>Dorgamba</HI>'s Spitting-Pot. Thus
we spent the greatest part of the day with
a great deal of Diversion, and on the 19th,
being a great Feast day at Court, we were
again splendidly Entertained at the <HI>Bog∣degan's</HI>
Table.</P>
<P>In the year 1694. on the 6th of <HI>Ianu∣ary,</HI>
and on the 16th, we were again in∣vited
to the <HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s Table. On the 26th
of the same month, the <HI>Dorgamba</HI> obliged
us with the sight of a very fierce Panther,
and the same day we were again ad∣mitted
to the <HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s Table. On the
27th we paid a visit to the Jesuits, who
treated us with a very good Breakfast;
Their Church is a very curious piece of
Architecture, with a fine Organ, which
is placed on the outside of it towards the
Street. There were at that time eight
Fathers of that Society at <HI>Peking.</HI> On the
29th it was a hard Frost, with a strong
North Wind and abundance of Snow.
On the 4th of <HI>February</HI> both the <HI>Adogeda</HI>'s
brought Orders for the Ambassador to
make his Appearance at Court. Accor∣dingly
we went on Horseback to Court
on the 5th of <HI>February,</HI> where after we
<PB N="98" REF="56"/>
had been entertain'd very splendidly at the
<HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s Table, the Ambassador was told,
that according to his desire he should
be dismiss'd in twelve nights.</P>
<P>Accordingly on the 15th of <HI>Febr.</HI> the
<HI>Bogdegan</HI> sent one of his Coutiers to the Am∣bassador
to desire him to come to Court
the next morning with all his Attendance,
and the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> to receive the usual Pre∣sents
of the <HI>Bogdegan.</HI> The day be∣fore
we went to Court we were treated
at the <HI>Bogdegan</HI>'s Charge at our Quarters,
when the Ambassador with his whole
Attendance went on Horseback, being
conducted by the <HI>Adogeda</HI>'s into a spacious
Court, where we received the following
Presents.</P>
<P>A Horse, with Bridle and Saddle, and
all other Accoutrements.</P>
<P>A <HI>Chinese</HI> Cap, with a Silk Puff on the
top of it.</P>
<P>A Sur-toot of Damask Brocaded with
Gold Serpents, and lined with Lamb-Skins.</P>
<P>A Scarff, a Knife, 6 Handkerchiefs, and
2 Tobacco Bags.</P>
<P>A pair of Leather Boots, and a pair of
Silk Stockings.</P>
<P>A piece of Black Sattin of 10 yards.</P>
<P>A piece of <HI>Ludan</HI> of 20 yards.
16 pieces of <HI>Kitaick.</HI></P>
<P>7 <HI>Lan</HI> of Silver worth 14 Crowns.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="56"/>
The Ambassador's Gentlemen had each
of them the following Presents.</P>
<P>A <HI>Chinese</HI> Cap, with a red Silk Puff on
the top.</P>
<P>A Damask Surtoot lined with Lambs-Skin.</P>
<P>A piece of Sattin of 10 yards.</P>
<P>A piece of <HI>Ludan</HI> of 10 yards.</P>
<P>A Scarff, with a Knife, 2 Tobacco
Baggs, and 6 Handkerchiefs.</P>
<P>One pair of Leather Boots, with a
pair of Silk Stockings quilted with Cotton.</P>
<P>16 pieces of <HI>Kitaick.</HI></P>
<P>One <HI>Lan</HI> and a half of Silver worth
3 Crowns.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cosacks</HI> and Servants received each
the following Presents.</P>
<P>A piece of Sattin of 10 yards.</P>
<P>Eight pieces of <HI>Kitaick.</HI></P>
<P>One <HI>Lan</HI> of Silver.</P>
<P>On the 18th of <HI>February,</HI> the Ambassa∣dor
being again invited to Court, the
<HI>Dorgamba</HI> told him, that if he were ready
for his departure, the Carriages should
attend him the next morning at his
Quarters. I am not ignorant that in
this place I ought to give the Reader a
particular Account of the Manners, Cu∣stoms
and Religion of the <HI>Chineses;</HI> but
I will content my self to give only in this
<PB N="100" REF="57"/>
Journal a general Account of the Empire
of <HI>China,</HI> and its Capital City called
<HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>The most Potent Empire of <HI>China</HI> is
known under several Names among Fo∣reign
Nations. The <HI>Tartars</HI> call it <HI>Katay,</HI>
those of <HI>Siam, Sin,</HI> the <HI>Iapanneses, Than,</HI>
and some of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Nations call
it <HI>Han.</HI> The <HI>Chineses</HI> themselves have
given it many Sir-names; for among the
many Families that have sway'd the <HI>Chi∣nese</HI>
Scepter, each Founder of its Race has
assigned it its particular Title. Thus it
is called <HI>Than,</HI> (broad without measure)
<HI>Iu,</HI> (Peace), <HI>Tha,</HI> (large), <HI>Sciam,</HI> (pleasant),
<HI>Cheu,</HI> (complea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>); but among all the rest,
the <HI>Chineses</HI> have retain'd two, the first
of which is, <HI>Chungehoa,</HI> that is, the <HI>Middle
Empire,</HI> and <HI>Chunque,</HI> which is the
<HI>Middle Garden,</HI> being of Opinion that
the Earth was four Square, and their
Empire in the midst of it.</P>
<P>This vast Country was in the year
before the Birth of Christ 2254, divided
into 12 Provinces by their Emperor <HI>Xucus,</HI>
and by his Successor <HI>Iva</HI> into 9, which at
that time comprehended only the Nor∣thern
Provinces, as far as the River <HI>Kiang.</HI>
But after the Southern Parts were united
with this Empire, it was divided into
<PB N="101" REF="57"/>
fifteen Provinces. Most of them
were formerly under the Jurisdiction of
their own Princes, but after they were
Conquered and United with the <HI>Chinese</HI>
Crown, were Governed by Viceroy's,
who to this day have the Administration
of Affairs in those Places. It is divided
into the Northern and Southern Part.
The first is that which is properly called
<HI>Katay</HI> by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and comprehends
5 Provinces: to wit, <HI>Peking, Xantung,
Xansi, Xiemsi, Honan,</HI> to which some add
the Province of <HI>Leaotung,</HI> and the Penin∣sula
of <HI>Corea.</HI> The other 9 Provinces,
are; <HI>Nanking, Chekiang, Kiangsi, Hu∣quang,
Suchuen, Queicheu, Iunnan, Qu∣angsi,
Quantung, Fockien,</HI> which by one
general Name are called by the <HI>Tartars,
Mangin.</HI> The North and Southern Pro∣vinces
are divided by the River <HI>Kiang,</HI>
(by the <HI>Chineses,</HI>) called the <HI>Son of the
Ocean.</HI>) The Empire of <HI>China</HI> borders on
the East on the great <HI>Eastern Ocean,</HI> cal∣led
by the <HI>Chineses, Tung.</HI> Towards the
North, on the <HI>Chinese</HI> Wall, which di∣vides
it from the <HI>Great Tartary;</HI> on the
West it has the Mountain of <HI>Thebet</HI> to the
Confines of <HI>Bengala:</HI> On the South-side
is the Kingdom of <HI>Couchinchina,</HI> which is
Tributary to the <HI>Chineses</HI> Empire. Its
<PB N="102" REF="58"/>
whole Breadth, from the Isle of <HI>Hanon,</HI>
situate under the 18th Degree of North
Latitude, to the 42th Degree of North
Latitude, is 330 <HI>German</HI> Leagues. Its
length from the West, under the 112th
Degree, till East under the 34th Degree,
near the City <HI>Ningpo</HI> or <HI>Nampo,</HI> is 450
<HI>German</HI> Leagues.</P>
<P>This whole Empire seems both by Art
and Nature made impregnable. For on
the West side is the Mountain of <HI>Thebet,</HI>
and the great Desart of <HI>Xama;</HI> On the
North side the famous <HI>Chinese</HI> Wall, which
was begun to be built in the year 215 be∣fore
Christ's Birth, and was finished in
5 years; On the South and East it is sur∣rounded
with the Ocean, where by reason
of the many Rocks and Sands there is no
no safe Landing unless it be in a few
places.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Peking,</HI> the Capital of the
Empire, and Residence of its Kings, has
borrowed its Name from the Province of
<HI>Peking,</HI> which on the East Borders on the
great Gulph betwixt <HI>Corea</HI> and <HI>Iapan;</HI>
on the North-East upon the Province of
<HI>Leaotung,</HI> on the North upon the <HI>Great
Tartary,</HI> and part of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Wall,
and on the West the Province of <HI>Xansi.</HI>
This Province has 8 famous Cities, to wit;
<PB N="103" REF="58"/>
<HI>Peking, Paoting, Hokian, Chinting, Xunte,
Quanping, Taming,</HI> and <HI>Iunping:</HI> The
City of <HI>Peking</HI> is situate under 39 De∣grees
59 Minutes upon the Northern Con∣fines
of the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> not far
from the famous <HI>Chinese</HI> Wall. On the
South side it is fortified with two very
strong and high Walls. The Suburbs
are enclosed in one single Wall, with 3
very good Bastions on each side of the
Gate. You enter these Suburbs by a
Bridge built over a River, which to the
North side surrounds the Wall; from the
Suburbs through the South-Gate, it is
half an hours walking before you come
to the Body of the City, where, at the
Entrance there is a very high Bastion, and
as you turn to the left, another well-mounted
with Cannon, from whence you
may go into the City through the Old
Gate. There are many other Bastions to
be seen all round the Walls, where every
night the Garison keeps as strict a Guard
as if an Enemy were near at hand; but
in the day time, the Emperor's Gentlemen
of the Bed-Chamber Guard the Gates,
not so much for its Defence, as to look
after the Customs, which are to be paid
there. The Citizens Houses are gene∣rally
finely built, and the Palaces of
<PB N="104" REF="59"/>
Persons of Quality very stately Structures,
but their greatest Magnificence appears in
their Triumphal Arches. Their Temples
are Adorned with Steeples of an extra∣ordinary
height, and most Artificially
built: But the Streets of this so stately
City are in no wise suitable to its Gran∣deur,
there being very few among
them Paved with Stones, which
seems to be strange in a place where
they don't want these Materials, the Streets
being extreamly inconvenient and trou∣blesome
to walk both in fair and fowl
weather. In dry weather, when the
Wind blows from the North, the Dust is
raised all over the City to that degree,
that it spoils every thing in the Houses.
The Inhabitants preserve themselves a lit∣tle
when they go abroad, by wearing a
thin Veil almost like our Gawses, over
their Faces, which comes down to their
Breasts; besides that, they can see every
body that passes without being seen by
them, and without exposing their Fa∣ces
to the Dust; they enjoy by it this
conveniency, that they are not obliged
to those frequent Salutes and other Cere∣monies
which are so much admired, and
otherwise practised among the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="59"/>
All the <HI>Chinese</HI> Women are of a verylow
Stature, those of Quality have very little
Feet, in which they take a particular
pride, for which reason they keep them
extraordinary streightned, to such an ex∣cess,
that many thereby quite lose the use
of their Feet. It is look'd upon as very
ignominious among the <HI>Chinese</HI> Ladies to
shew their naked Feet. There is scarce a
Street, Bridge or Gate in the City of <HI>Pe∣king,</HI>
where you don't meet with Horses
or Asses, which may be hir'd for a small
price to go up and down the Streets,
where a Servant attends you and your
Horse. The Streets are always crouded
with People; here you may see one dance
upon the Rope, in another place you see
one upon the Stage, who is surrounded
with many Auditors, unto whom he relates
certain Stories, and these reward him for
his pains with a kind of Brass-Money,
which being four square, sign'd on one
side with four Characters, and a hole in
the middle for the conveniency of carry∣ing
them upon a string, ten of them make
no more than a Penny. But when any
thing is to be bought or paid with Silver
they use this method: they always wear
by their sides a pair of Shears, and Weights
enclosed in wooden Cases in their
<PB N="106" REF="60"/>
Pockets, by which means they cut the
Silver Plates, and weigh of it as much as
they have occasion for at that time. You
meet sometimes in the Streets certain <HI>Chi∣neses,</HI>
who beat their Breasts with stones,
others knock their Heads against Stones,
till the Blood follows. There is scarce a
Street but what has many Publick-houses,
which are distinguished by their Sign-Posts,
where you find it written what
sort of Liquor they sell within. These
Houses are very neatly kept, and afford∣ing
good Accommodation.</P>
<P>But it is time to look backwards, and
to give you a short Account of our re∣turn
to <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>On the 19th of <HI>February</HI> towards Even∣ing,
we began our Journey from <HI>Peking,</HI>
being conducted out the Town by the
two <HI>Adogeda's,</HI> and several other Persons
of Quality to the next Village. About
five days Journey from <HI>Peking,</HI> the <HI>Sur∣gushey</HI>
(who was to conduct us as far as
to the City of <HI>Naun</HI>) brought us through
an old ruined City, where in one of their
Temples, we saw an Idol made of Clay
but richly gilt, representing a Woman;
it was about 15 yards high, and had ma∣ny
Heads and Hands. Not far from thence
in a Gallery, you saw another Figure, re∣sembling
<PB N="107" REF="60"/>
a Woman kind, which they said,
was her Daughter, lie in a Bed of Damask
Quilt, cover'd with rich <HI>Chinese</HI> Carpets.</P>
<P>On the 30th of <HI>May,</HI> we came to the
City of <HI>Naun,</HI> and took up our Quarters
in the Village <HI>Suttigart.</HI> On the 5th of
<HI>April,</HI> I was surprised in my Quarters by
a very strange Spectacle; For my Host's
Daughter appear'd all on a sudden, as if
she had been possess'd by the Devil, mak∣ing
such horrid out-cries, as put us all in
a fright. After she had thus continued
for some time, she began to sing very
agreeably for half an hour, when the o∣ther
Women there present, having begun
to sing certain Verses, she answered them
immediately. I was so curious as to en∣quire,
what could be the meaning of all
this; to which they reply'd, that there
being a Neighbour's Child very ill, this
Virgin had been consulted concerning her
Recovery, she being one vvho vvas in
great Esteem among them, and look'd
upon as a Saint. The Neighbours vvere
no sooner departed, but an Aunt of hers
took a fevv Coals, upon vvhich she threw
certain Incenses, vvhich holding near her
Face, she soon opened her Eyes, and re∣covered
her Senses.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="61"/>
On the 14th of <HI>April,</HI> vve set forvvard
in our Journey from <HI>Naun,</HI> in Company
of a <HI>Chinese</HI> Envoy, vvho being a native
of the City of <HI>Margenn,</HI> vvas sent by the
<HI>Bogdegan,</HI> to the <HI>Waywode</HI> of <HI>Nartzinskoy.</HI>
On the 23th of <HI>April,</HI> vve pass'd over a
very high Mountain, not vvithout a great
deal of difficulty, the <HI>Snow</HI> being above a
Yard high on the top. On the 25th, vve
changed our Course, being forevvarn'd
by our Guide, vvho vvas a <HI>Tungoese,</HI> that
three or four thousand <HI>Mongul Tartars</HI>
laid in Ambush for us, expecting our
coming at a certain place. This
obliged the Ambassador to chuse an∣other
Road more to the right. On the
27th, vve came to the River <HI>Laduna,</HI>
vvhere vve halted for some time. On the
2d of <HI>May,</HI> vve pass'd over the River
<HI>Keilar,</HI> and vve had not travell'd very
far, before on the third of <HI>May,</HI> vve
vvere overraken by a Fire: For the <HI>Mon∣gul
Tartars,</HI> finding they had miss'd their
Aim, had out of Revenge, set fire to the
long and dry Grass, which was remain∣ing,
after the Winter Season, in the Desart,
which being augmented by the violent
Winds that blew towards us, surprised
us so on a sudden, that we had not time
enough left us, to save our Tents. If this
<PB N="109" REF="61"/>
Fire had surprised us as we were upon our
march, scarce any body would have es∣caped
the Flames that surrounded us on
all sides. But now we had the good for∣tune
to save our Cattle, and the damage
received by the Fire was inconsiderable on
our side, what was endamaged in our
Carriages, being all repair'd in one
day. The worst was, that being depri∣ved
of Forage, some of our Cattle died
daily for want of it, and we our selves be∣gan
to be much streightned for Provisions.
For which reason the Ambassador dis∣patched
three <HI>Cosacks</HI> to the <HI>Waywode</HI> of
<HI>Nartzinskoy,</HI> to solicite prompt Succors
of Cattle and Provisions. And wherever
we could light of any Horses or Camels,
we bought them up at a dear rate; the
first at 40 and 50, the last at 70 or 80
<HI>Rubels</HI> a-piece.</P>
<P>The 8th of <HI>May,</HI> we came to the Ri∣ver
<HI>Margenn,</HI> where meeting with good
Forage, we staid two days to refresh our
Cattle. And as we were travelling, we
lost one of our <HI>Russian</HI> Servants, who
having lost his Horse, was lost himself in
looking after it. On the 12th, we pass'd
the River <HI>Gann</HI> with our loaden Camels
and Horses; and finding the Trees here∣abouts
full of green Leaves and a plea∣sant
<PB N="110" REF="62"/>
Country, we staid here two days.
On the 15th of <HI>May;</HI> we met the Con∣voy,
which by order of the Governour of
<HI>Nartzinskoy,</HI> was sent us from <HI>Argunn.</HI>
They came to us in very good time; for if
they had staid two days longer, our Cattle
must all have perish'd, and we been dro∣ven
to the necessity of feeding on Horse-Flesh;
for most of our Servants had lost
their Horses before, and were fain to
march on Foot through the Desart. On
the 21th of <HI>May,</HI> notwithstanding there
was a deep Snow faln the night before,
we Ferry'd over the River of <HI>Argunn,</HI>
a long days Journey from the City of the
same name, where we staid till the 25th
and provided our selves with all Neces∣saries,
enough to serve us till we came to
<HI>Nartzinskoy.</HI> Most of our Attendance
began to be very sickly hereabouts, by
reason, that having not been used to any
Bread before these six Months, they eat of
it with too much greediness. At some
distance from <HI>Argunn,</HI> the Ambassador,
with some of his <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Russian</HI> At∣tendance
left the <HI>Caravan,</HI> making the
best of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way towards <HI>Nartzinskoy.</HI>
On the 1st of <HI>Iune,</HI> we came to a small
River, which being by the late Rains
rendred impassable by Horses, we were
<PB N="111" REF="62"/>
feign to strip, and so to swim over our
selves and our Horses. On the second,
we arriv'd safely at <HI>Nartzinskoy,</HI> as did
our <HI>Caravan</HI> on the 9th following. The
13th of <HI>Iune,</HI> three <HI>Tungoeses</HI> brought
the <HI>Russian</HI> Servant, whom we had lost
on the 8th of <HI>May</HI> in the Desart to <HI>Nart∣zinskoy.</HI>
He had swarved about the De∣sart
for three days, having no other Food,
but Herbs and Roots, and meeting at
last with these three <HI>Tungoeses,</HI> whom he
believed to have been <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI> he
put himself in a posture of defence, and
would not have surrendred himself, if his
Horse had not been so tir'd, as not to be
able to stir any longer. On the 3d of
<HI>Iuly,</HI> we set forward from <HI>Nartzinskoy,</HI>
after the Ambassador had dispatch'd
two Messengers to <HI>Mosco,</HI> to notifie our
safe arrival, to Their <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesties;
and on the same day the <HI>Chinese</HI> Envoy,
whom we mentioned before, return'd
from thence to <HI>Naun.</HI> This last Winter,
whilst we were at <HI>Peking, 350 Cosacks</HI> of
<HI>Nartzinskoy,</HI> and 500 <HI>Tungoeses,</HI> had
made an Incursion into the Territories of
the <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI> through the Desarts
of <HI>Nartzinskoy,</HI> with such Success, that
they had attack'd and ruin'd their Habi∣tations
on two several places, put all the
<PB N="112" REF="63"/>
old ones to the Sword, and carried off the
young ones into Slavery. The 13th of
<HI>Iuly,</HI> we came to <HI>Plotbus,</HI> the 15th to the
Lake of <HI>Shock,</HI> the 19th to the Lake of
<HI>Ierawena,</HI> near which are three Lakes
more. On the 21th of <HI>Iuly,</HI> our two
Messengers, who had been dispatch'd to
<HI>Mosco,</HI> as we mention'd before, return'd
to us in a pitiful Condition, they having
been overtaken about 10 Miles from <HI>V∣dinsko,</HI>
by some <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI> who
had robb'd and stript them, but had not
taken their Letters from them. On the
22th, we foarded the River <HI>Ana,</HI> which
falls into the River <HI>Vda:</HI> And on the 26th
the River <HI>Kurba,</HI> which running with a
very swift current, disembogues likewise
in the River <HI>Vda.</HI> On the 27th, in the
Afternoon, we arriv'd safely at <HI>Vdinsko;</HI>
where we sold our Camels and Horses at
five <HI>Rubels</HI> a-piece; whereas the Camels
had cost us 35 and 40 <HI>Rubels,</HI> and the
Horses 10 and 15 a-piece. On the 28th,
we embarqu'd our selves on board two
large Vessels; and towards Evening went
on shoar in a great Village, call'd <HI>Saimko∣jam
Linsko,</HI> on the left-side of the River
<HI>Selinga.</HI> On the 29th in the Afternoon,
we set Sail from thence, and on the 31th
came to the entrance of the Lake of <HI>Bai∣kela,</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="63"/>
where we were fain to lay by for
two hours, and afterwards row'd three
miles further, before we could make use
of our Sails. Towards Evening the wind
chopping about, we were droven back
for several miles, and at last met with a
place fit for Anchorage. The Winds be∣ing
somewhat laid, we early in the Morn∣ing
set Sail again, and happily made the
River of <HI>Angara,</HI> and so arriv'd on the first
of <HI>August,</HI> toward Noon at <HI>Irkutskoy.</HI> On
the 5th, we again set Sail from hence to∣wards
<HI>Ienekiskoy.</HI> On the 11th, we went
on shoar in a Town belonging to the
<HI>Bratskoy,</HI> on the left-side of the River of
<HI>Angara,</HI> into which falls hereabouts an∣other
very large River. We left that
Place again the same day in the After∣noon,
and had not sail'd above a Mile,
when we were forced to pass a very dan∣gerous
Cataract (or Water-fall) call'd
<HI>Pogmaly.</HI> Not far from thence we pass'd
another, call'd <HI>Pyan,</HI> much longer than the
former; and no sooner were the Vessels
brought over this dangerous Place, but
they were in danger of having been swal∣lowed
up in a Whirl-pool. On the 12th
of <HI>August,</HI> we came to another Cataract,
call'd <HI>Poduna,</HI> where we were fain to un∣load
our Vessels; the Passage being very

streight and dangerous. On the 13th,
we pass'd another Cataract, not so dan∣gerous
as the former, but which conti∣nued
for four or five miles. On the 14th,
we came to an Anchor near the Cataract,
call'd <HI>Skamansko,</HI> till we could be provi∣ded
with expert Watermen, who being
acquainted with the River, brought our
Vessels safely without being unloaden
(the Water being very high) over the
Cataract, tho' it was near three Miles
long. On the 16th, before Noon, we
pass'd by the River <HI>Itim,</HI> which falls on
the right-hand into the River <HI>Tungusko,</HI>
as the <HI>Angara</HI> does to the left. We pass'd
the same day over another Cataract; and
on the 17th left the River <HI>Ketto</HI> to the
right of us. On the 19th, we pass'd o∣ver
three several Cataracts, near the last
of which, we were met by a Messenger,
whose name being <HI>Andreknihoff,</HI> had been
dispatch'd by the Ambassador from <HI>Nart∣zinskoy</HI>
to <HI>Musco.</HI> On the 22d, we left
the River <HI>Kama</HI> to the right of us; and
on the 25th in the Morning, pass'd over
another most dangerous Cataract, and ar∣rived
safely the same Evening at <HI>Ienekis∣koy.</HI>
We continued our Journey from
thence on the 1st of <HI>September</HI> by Land
to <HI>Makoffsko,</HI> where we arriv'd the 3d day,
<PB N="115" REF="67"/>
and on the 7th, set forward again to∣wards
<HI>Tobolsko.</HI> On the 12th, we din'd
in a Monastery, but did not stay longer
than till night. On the 23d, early in the
Morning, we came to <HI>Iam-Kutskoy;</HI> and
on the 26th towards Evening, to the Ci∣ty
of <HI>Narim,</HI> about a Mile distance from
the River <HI>Oby,</HI> where we embarqu'd on
the 28th, but came on shoar again in the
Afternoon, by reason of a strong North-wind,
which was quite contrary to us;
we were fain to lie here till the 30th. On
the 3d of <HI>October,</HI> the Wind veering about
again to the North, we were obliged to
come to another again till night; when
we pass'd by the River <HI>Wache.</HI> The 4th,
the Wind blew strong again from the
North, so that we were fain to lie still till
the next Morning. On the 6th, we were
stopt again by the North-wind, besides
which, it froze very hard that night. On
the 8th, we got on shoar at <HI>Surgutt;</HI> and
on the 9th the North-wind blew very
strong against us, with great Snows and
a hard Frost, so that we were obliged to
stay on shoar till the 11th, when it began
to thaw; but the North-wind continued
till the 13th, in the Morning, when we set
Sail again, and pass'd by two Villages;
the 14th, in the Forenoon, we entred
<PB N="116" REF="68"/>
the River <HI>Irtish;</HI> and on the 15th, early
in the Morning, arriv'd safely at <HI>Samors∣kojam.</HI></P>
<P>The Ambassador being indisposed staid
there till the 14th of <HI>November,</HI> when,
being restor'd to his former Health by the
use of proper Remedies, and the River
<HI>Irtish</HI> being quite frozen up in the mean
while, we continued our Journey from
<HI>Samarskojam</HI> in Sleds. On the 19th, we
came to <HI>Demjansko;</HI> and on the 20th to
<HI>Tobolsko.</HI> Betwixt <HI>Samarskojam</HI> and <HI>To∣bolsko,</HI>
we pass'd by abundance of Huts
belonging to the <HI>Ostiaki,</HI> most of Wood,
and the Roads were hereabouts very nar∣row
and not well beaten. On the 17th
of <HI>December,</HI> we left <HI>Tobolsko;</HI> and the
20th in the Afternoon arrived at <HI>Tumen.</HI>
From thence we went on the 21st, and
came on the 23d too early in the Morn∣ing
to the City of <HI>Iapantshin,</HI> where we
staid only till the next day; and on the
27th early in the Morning, arrived in the
City of <HI>Wergaturia,</HI> from whence we
went further on in our Journey the 28th.</P>
<P>In the Year 1695, on <HI>New-years-day,</HI>
we came to the City of <HI>Sotokamskoy,</HI>
where we staid till the next day; On
the 5th we reach'd <HI>Kaigorod,</HI> which we
left again the 6th; and on the 9th came
<PB N="117" REF="68"/>
to <HI>Iam-Vsga,</HI> situate upon the River <HI>Si∣sella.</HI>
The 9th we din'd at <HI>Iata Pyoldie,</HI>
and the 11th at <HI>Ianrspas Vspilsco.</HI> The
12th we reach'd St. <HI>Soto Witzogda,</HI> where
we staid the next day till towards Even∣ing.
The 14th we came to the City of
<HI>Vtingha,</HI> and left it again the 15th to∣wards
Evening. The 18th we din'd in
the City of <HI>Totma,</HI> where we staid till
the 19th towards night. The 21st, early
in the Morning we reach'd <HI>Schusca-jam,</HI> and
continued our Journey from thencethe
next day. The 25th we came to <HI>Ieresla,</HI>
where we only staid till night. On the 27th
to <HI>Peresla,</HI> from whence we set forward a∣gain
in our Journey on the 29th, and on the
31st of <HI>Ian.</HI> at night, arrived safely in a Vil∣llage,
call'd <HI>Alexeshe</HI> on the River <HI>Ianse,</HI> not
above five miles from the City of <HI>Musco.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Ambassador received Orders to
stay till the next Morning, when Czar <HI>Pe∣ter
Alexievits</HI> came to this place to confer
with him in private. After they had spent
some hours together, the Czar took the
Ambassador along with him to <HI>Ischmei∣loff,</HI>
and from thence to <HI>Brebolensko;</HI> and
we arrived the same day, being the 1st of
<HI>February,</HI> safely in the City of <HI>Musco,</HI>
where we repos'd our selves after our Jour∣ney
to <HI>China,</HI> in which we had spent 3
years, wanting 6 weeks.</P>

<P>THey have three sorts of Salts in
<HI>Russia;</HI> the first is boil'd out of
Springs, of which the best is
made at <HI>Permia</HI> in <HI>Siberia.</HI> The second
is, their Stone-Salt, which is found in
great quantity in the Province of <HI>Vffa;</HI>
The third is brought to perfection by the
heat of the Sun in the Salt-Pits, near <HI>A∣strachan,</HI>
and in <HI>Siberia.</HI> There is also
<PB N="122" REF="71"/>
great store of the best Salt-petre to be
found, as also good Brimstone, betwixt
<HI>Siberia</HI> and the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> not far from
the Kingdom of <HI>Casan:</HI> but the exporta∣tion
of it is prohibited.</P>
<P>There are also some Iron-Mines in <HI>Rus∣sia,</HI>
and near <HI>Olonitz,</HI> on the confines of
<HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>Archangel</HI> there is <HI>Sluida</HI> Talck
dug, which the <HI>English</HI> call <HI>Muscovy</HI>
Glass.</P>
<P>In the the Province of <HI>Vffa,</HI> are found
very fine Chrystals.</P>
<P>On the frontiers of <HI>Siberia,</HI> near the
River <HI>Ienessay,</HI> there is a Mine which pro∣duces
an Oar, resembling in colour and
weight a golden Oar, but it is so volatile
as to flie away in the Smoak, as soon as it
is tryed by the Fire. Perhaps this Oar is
much of the same nature in comparison to
Gold, what a certain Oar in <HI>Germany,</HI>
call'd <HI>Bismuth,</HI> is in respect to Silver, it
being of the same colour and weight, and
is found in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Silver Mines.</P>
<P>The <HI>Russians</HI> are destitute of Silver
Mines, but they often dig some of the
Metal out of the old Graves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mammotovoy,</HI> which is dug out of
the Earth in <HI>Siberia,</HI> is very well worth
taking notice of. The common People in
<PB N="123" REF="71"/>
<HI>Russia</HI> relate surprising things concerning
its Origin. For they say, they are the
Bones of certain Animals, which exceed
in bigness any living Creature upon
Earth; They make use of it in Physick,
as we do of the Unicorn. A friend of
mine presented me with a piece of it,
which he said was given him by a <HI>Mus∣covite,</HI>
who had brought it himself out
of <HI>Siberia,</HI> which appears to me to be no∣thing
else than a true Ivory. The more
understanding Sort believe them to be E∣lephants
Teeth, which ever since the
time of the Deluge, have lain thus under
ground.</P>
<P>The <HI>Adamavoi-Kost</HI> or <HI>Adam's Earth,</HI> is
dug out of the Earth near <HI>Archangel;</HI> it
is of a black Colour, very near as hard
as a Stone, but its figure resembles the
Branches of Trees; from whence some
conjecture that it is a Wood petrefied.
According to this Opinion, it must be
supposed that this Wood being perhaps
laid at the bottom of some River, whose
Current has been choak'd up by the Sands,
and covered these Woods.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="124" REF="72"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their Vegetables.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ground in many Parts of <HI>Mus∣covy</HI>
is more fertile than can well be
imagined by Strangers. For it being full
of Nitrous particles, these not only pro∣mote
the Production of all kinds of
Fruits, but also quicken their growth,
and bring them sooner to perfection, than
in some of the more Southern Countries;
as it is besides some other Fruits, very
observable in their Melons. They have a
certain kind of Apples, call'd <HI>Nativa,</HI>
which are not only of a fine taste, but
also transparent like Glass. They have
also several sorts of Berries, which are
not to be found in other places. The
<HI>Hostanici</HI> are of a black colour, but of the
same taste as our Cherries, having also a
Stone in the middle. Their <HI>Punanitzi</HI>
they use to suppress the Fumes after hard
drinking. Besides which, they have those
call'd, <HI>Brussenici Kluckva and Gersmici;</HI>
the two last of which are also found in
<HI>Livonia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="72"/>
But among all their Vegetables, that
Herb which they call, <HI>Kosa Travic,</HI> de∣serves
to be taken notice of, for it resists
Iron, and makes the Sythes if they touch
it, spring to pieces. I cannot question
the truth of it, because I have heard it
confirm'd by very credible Persons, who
have seen the effect of it in <HI>Siberia;</HI> tho' o∣therwise
I am not very apt to give credit
to the Relations of the vulgar sort in
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> among which, that of the Ve∣getable
Lamm is a general received Fa∣ble,
sufficiently contradicted by Experi∣ence.</P>
<P>There is a certain Root in <HI>Russia,</HI> en∣dow'd
with an extraordinary Balsamick
Quality, which also grows in <HI>Siberia,</HI>
they call it <HI>Voltschnoy-Koron,</HI> which sig∣nifies
as much as <HI>Wolfs-Root.</HI> They at∣tribute
to it a specifick Vertue of healing
Wounds; But what they related of it,
to wit, that it heals a Wound by only
chewing of it, I will not affirm for truth.</P>
<P><HI>Arbusi</HI> are called the <HI>Astrachan</HI> Melons;
they are not of so delicious a taste as the
others; they come nearer to a circular
Figure, and their Seeds don't lie in the
middle, but straggling thro' the Flesh of
the Melon.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="73"/>
The <HI>Astrachan</HI> Pepper is more sharp
and biting than other Pepper, is enclosed
in a red Husk, the Pepper it self is yel∣low,
and not round but flattish.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of their living Creatures.</HEAD>
<P>AMong the Insects of <HI>Russia,</HI> those
call'd <HI>Toreau,</HI> are the most common,
they most infest wooden Houses, but are
not mischievous. Among the Fish, the
<HI>Sterlet</HI> is counted one of the most delici∣ous
in <HI>Russia.</HI> It has a long Head and
Tail, both of them making up above one
half of its whole length, the rest of the
Body being but very short. Its Skin is
most like that of an Eel; those inclining
to a yellowish colour, are accounted the
best.</P>
<P>The Fish <HI>Sasan</HI> is very like our
Carps. <HI>Somis,</HI> a very broad Fish, with a
sharp Nose.</P>
<P><HI>Beluga,</HI> or <HI>White-Fish,</HI> is sometimes
found in the <HI>Danube,</HI> near <HI>Comorrah;</HI>
they call it <HI>Hausam</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and is
carried to <HI>Vienna,</HI> where it is look'd upon
<PB N="127" REF="73"/>
as a great Dainty, its Flesh being very
luscious. Out of the Spawn of this Fish
the best <HI>Caviare</HI> is made in <HI>Muscovy;</HI>
tho' they also make it of the Spawn of
the Sturgeons and Pikes. The River <HI>Ka∣ma,</HI>
which exonerates it self into the Ri∣ver
<HI>Wolga,</HI> furnishes the City of <HI>Musco</HI>
with the best <HI>Beluga.</HI></P>
<P>I don't remember that ever I met with
any Birds in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> but what are suf∣ficiently
known among other <HI>European</HI>
Nations. Among the four-legg'd Ani∣mals,
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> esteem those the
most, whose Furs protect them against
the Injuries of the cold Season.</P>
<P>They have four different kinds of Foxes.
The first are the ordinary sort; the second
are those who have two dark strokes cross
their Backs; and therefore are by the
<HI>Germans,</HI> called Cross Foxes. The third
are the white Foxes, whose Skins are the
cheapest of all; And fourthly, the black
ones, whose Skins are sold at a very dear
rate, sometimes, as I have been told, at
80 <HI>Rubels</HI> or <HI>Ducats</HI> a piece.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rosomacha,</HI> so called by reason of
its greediness, affords the most durable
Furs.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="74"/>
But the chief vanity of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
consists in their Sables. There is such a
prodigious difference betwixt these Furs,
that a pair of them are sold from three <HI>Ru∣bels</HI>
to a hundred <HI>Rubels.</HI> The black ones
are the most precious; but the white
ones are very rare.</P>
<P>In the great Plains betwixt <HI>Muscovy</HI>
and the <HI>Crim Tartary,</HI> there are abun∣dance
of wild Oxen, and wild Goats;
the first they call <HI>Zubri,</HI> the last <HI>Za∣jaki.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vichocolis,</HI> a kind of Water-Rats,
whose Skins are of a delicious Scent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Natives of Russia,</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Muscovites</HI> are generally of a
very strong Constitution, both very
tall and bulky. They are also very fruit∣ful,
which makes the Country very po∣pulous,
as may be judged by the vast
Armies which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> bring into
the Field in time of War. I have it
from very credible Persons, and such as
had considerable Commands in the pre∣sent
<HI>Czar</HI>'s Army, that a few years ago
the Army which was raised against the
<HI>Precopian Tartars,</HI> consisted of above
300000 Men. Above one half of the year
being taken up with their Fasts, when
the common People feed upon nothing
else but Cabbage and Cucumbers, and
these raw, only pickl'd. This is an evident
sign of their natural vigour, tho' it must
also be allow'd, that they promote
the digestion by the Brandy and Leeks,
which they use in great quantity, and
questionless, correct the viscous Humours
<PB N="130" REF="75"/>
arising in the Stomach by such indigesti∣ble
Nourishments. They know of no
Epidemical Distempers in <HI>Russia,</HI> unless
you would give the Scurvy, (the general
Plague of all the Northern Countries)
that Name. The <HI>Russians</HI> call it
<HI>Tsinga.</HI></P>
<P>Among the rest we ought not to pass
by in silence here their strange manner of
Travelling betwixt <HI>Siberia</HI> and <HI>China.</HI>
For they make use of Sleds with Sails,
which carry them over the Snow when
the Wind proves favourable; But if
it proves contrary, they have Dogs rea∣dy
at hand, who supply the defect of the
Sails, which are laid by at that time. I have
heard it affirm'd for truth, that twelve of
these Dogs will draw as much as a good
Horse.</P>
<P>The Commodities exported from <HI>Rus∣sia</HI>
are: Rhubarb, but much inferior in
goodness to that which is brought from
<HI>China</HI> and <HI>Turkey.</HI> Ambergreese, Honey,
Wax, Tar, Course Linen, Caviare
<HI>Russia</HI> Leather and Hemp. The City of
<HI>Ieresla</HI> is famous for the dressing of <HI>Russia</HI>
Leather, which as well as the <HI>Caviare,</HI> is
for the most part transported into <HI>Italy,</HI>
The <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> consume abun∣dance
of <HI>Russia</HI> Hemp, out of which
<PB N="131" REF="75"/>
they make their Cables for their Ships.
Sometimes the <HI>Dutch</HI> are also permitted
to export some Corn, of which they
make great profit. The Cities of <HI>Arch∣angel</HI>
and <HI>Narva,</HI> are the two chiefest
Places of Commerce betwixt the <HI>Russians,
English</HI> and <HI>Dutch.</HI> The first is most fre∣quented
by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the last by the
<HI>English.</HI> The <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants have
a free Trade at <HI>Narva,</HI> for the conveni∣cy
of transporting such Commodities as
they buy in <HI>Holland,</HI> by the way of <HI>Nar∣va,</HI>
into <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and from thence by
the River <HI>Wolga</HI> and the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> in∣to
<HI>Persia.</HI> But no body is permitted to
return into <HI>Persia</HI> by way of <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
unless he be come the same way before;
it being otherwise much easier to return
that way into <HI>Persia,</HI> than to come from
thence, as being against the current of
the River <HI>Wolga.</HI></P>
<P>Formerly the <HI>Banjans</HI> (who are <HI>In∣dian</HI>
Merchants) used to traffick in the
Capital City of <HI>Musco.</HI> But of late
they are forbidden to come any further
than <HI>Archangel,</HI> where they drive a very
considerable Trade.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="76"/>
There is also at present a constant
Trade betwixt <HI>Muscovy</HI> and <HI>China;</HI> from
whence the <HI>Muscovites</HI> bring Silks, <HI>Thee,</HI>
and among other things a certain mix∣ture,
almost like Chalk, but of a yellowish
colour, of an Aromatick Scent, which
is look'd upon as a Sovereign Remedy
against many Distempers. The <HI>Buchart∣zi,</HI>
who, if I mistake not, are Maho∣metans,
inhabiting near <HI>Samarkand,</HI> come
frequently to <HI>Tobolsko,</HI> the Capital City
of <HI>Siberia,</HI> with all sorts of <HI>Indian</HI> Com∣modities,
for which Reason perhaps it
is, that, as I have been informed, the
<HI>Arabian</HI> Tongue is taught in some places
of <HI>Siberia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Calmuck Tartars</HI> bring every
year after Harvest-time, a great many
thousands of Horses to Sale to the City
of <HI>Musco.</HI></P>
<P>They Trade also in Slaves, and some∣times
sell their own Children to the
<HI>Russians.</HI> I met once a young Boy of
that Country who understood the <HI>Rus∣sian</HI>
Tongue, whom out of Curiosity I
asked several Questions, and among the
rest, how they called God in his Native
Tongue; he answered, <HI>Bogunasniet, We
have no God.</HI> But it is nevertheless cer∣tain,
<PB N="133" REF="76"/>
that they have a certain Religion,
such a one as it is; their High Priest
being called <HI>Kutafta,</HI> who as well as the
<HI>Kutafta</HI> of the <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI> is sub∣ordinate
to the <HI>Dalac-Lama,</HI> who being
the <HI>Pagan Pope</HI> in those Parts, keeps his
Residence at a place called <HI>Baontola,</HI> not
far from the Confines of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>I have been credibly informed, that
the <HI>Chinese Lama's</HI> or Priests, do also
acknowledge this <HI>Dalac-Lama</HI> for their
Head. They are perswaded that this
<HI>Dalac-Lama</HI> is immortal, which Opinion
they maintain among the common Peo∣ple
without much difficulty; forasmuch
as he scarce ever appears, but to his
Priests, who are all Partners in the
Fraud.</P>
<P>I heard once a certain <HI>Muscovian</HI>
Lord, who had been sent as Ambassador
from <HI>Musco</HI> to <HI>China,</HI> say, that it was
offered him as a particular Favour, to
appear before the <HI>Dalac-Lama,</HI> provided
he would prostrate himself before him;
but, that he gave them many thanks for
the Honour they intended to do him,
without accepting their Offer.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="77"/>
I conclude with this hearty wish, that
the door of Mercy may be opened to
these blind Wretches, that they may be
brought out of darkness to partake of
the light of the true Religion.</P>
