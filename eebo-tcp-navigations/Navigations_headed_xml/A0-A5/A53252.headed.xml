<HEAD>Upon this Book, and
its Author.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THis Author never was in Print before,</L>
<L>And (let this please or not) will never more.</L>
<L>If all the Press-Oppressors of this Age</L>
<L>Would so Resolve, 'twould Happiness presage:</L>
<L>He should as soon another Voyage take,</L>
<L>As be Oblig'd another Book to make.</L>
<L>His <HI>Canvas Boat</HI> Escaped Seas and Wind,</L>
<L>He fears this Paper-Vessel will not find</L>
<L>Such gentle Gales, when every Reader hath</L>
<L>Pow'r with a puff to sink the Writers Faith.</L>
<L>For who so Prints a Book, goes off from Shore,</L>
<L>To hazard that which was his own before:</L>
<L>As one poor Pinnace Over-match'd, that fights</L>
<L>With an Armado, so doth he who Writes:</L>
<L>If Books (like goodly Merchant-Ships) set forth,</L>
<L>Laden with Riches of the greatest worth;</L>
<L>With Councels, Fathers, Text-men, School-Men Mann'd,</L>
<L>With Sacred Canon Mounted at each Hand;</L>
<L>Are hard beset, and forc'd to make Defence</L>
<L>Against Arm'd Atheism, Pride and Impudence.</L>
<L>How can this little Cock-Boat hope and Escape,</L>
<L>When Scripture Suffers Piracy and Rape?</L>
<L><HI>Noe</HI>'s Ark (wherein the World Epitomiz'd,</L>
<L>And Mankind in Octavo was Compriz'd.)</L>
<L>Though in the Deluge 'twas preserved sound,</L>
<L>By Infidelity it self lyes drown'd.</L>
<L>That <HI>Moses</HI> with a Rod the Sea should Cane,</L>
<L>And Beat the Coward streams into a Plain;</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>
With the same Cane should broach a Flint, and bring</L>
<L>Out of its Fiery Womb a flowing Spring:</L>
<L>That a dry stick assign'd for <HI>Levie</HI>'s share,</L>
<L>Should Bud, and Blossom, and Ripe Almonds bear;</L>
<L>That <HI>Sampson</HI> with the Jaw-Bone of an Ass</L>
<L>(And Atheists think Him one that lets it pass</L>
<L>Without a Scomme) should slay a Thousand Men,</L>
<L>And being weary with the Slaughter; then</L>
<L>The kind Jaw-Bone, that was his Faulchion first,</L>
<L>Should turn a Flaggon, and allay his Thirst.</L>
<L>These Miracles, and all the Sacred store.</L>
<L>Which Faith should grasp, and Piety adore,</L>
<L>Met with Arrests, Arraignments, and a Doom</L>
<L>More harsh than Tales of Heathen <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet <HI>O</HI> the Folly of Confounded Man!</L>
<L>Who cannot Truth believe, but Fathers can.</L>
<L>When Truth that cannot Lye, shall be bely'd,</L>
<L>Its Pow'r defy`d, and Weakness Deify'd:</L>
<L>When our Diseased Appetite shall Lust</L>
<L>For <HI>Egyts</HI> Leek, or <HI>Gibeons</HI> Mouldy Crust;</L>
<L><HI>Ephraim</HI> will feed on Ashes, and disdain</L>
<L>The Manna Comfits, and the Candy'd Rain.</L>
<L>An Heaven-born Truth (like poor Mens Infants) may</L>
<L>For lack of God-Fathers, unchrist'ned stay,</L>
<L>And find no Priest; when every stander by</L>
<L>Will be a Gossip to a Great Mans Lye.</L>
<L>O Miracle of Love! God-Man was fain</L>
<L>Each Miracle he wrought, to make it twain,</L>
<L>The Fact, and Faith too, else the Fact in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There is a Generation alive,</L>
<L>That Live on Lying Miracles and thrive,</L>
<L>There is a Guild of Priests will undertake</L>
<L>To make that God who doth all Wonders make:</L>
<L>Can make Him, Bake Him, Break Him, Eat him too,</L>
<L>And with a Thought can All again undo.</L>
<L>Had but some Monk this History to Dress,</L>
<L>He would have made the Iron-Teeth of th' Press</L>
<PB REF="4"/>
<L>Turn Edge, and grin, to chew the stuff and stile;</L>
<L>Compar'd with which, all's Pap in <HI>Mandevile.</HI></L>
<L>Had these Five Comrades been good Sons of <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>Nothing but Miracles had brought them home.</L>
<L><HI>Okely</HI> hae been inspired; <HI>Jephs</HI> had Seen</L>
<L>An Apron dropt down from Heavens Virgin-Queen</L>
<L>To make a Sail; <HI>Carpenter</HI> should have pray'd</L>
<L>Saint <HI>Joseph</HI> to assist him at his Trade;</L>
<L>And the next Morn did in the Cellar find</L>
<L>The Keel, Ribbs, Pins; all Model'd to his Mind.</L>
<L>An Holy Sea-Calf in St. <HI>Peters</HI> Coat,</L>
<L>Had then appear'd, and danc'd before the Boat:</L>
<L>Saint <HI>Christopher</HI> with a Sweet Babe on's Back,</L>
<L>Had stalkt along to save from Rock and Wrack:</L>
<L>Saint <HI>Nicholas</HI> (or in his Shape, <HI>Old Nick)</HI></L>
<L>Had with a straw steer'd the Boat Catholick.</L>
<L>The Tortoise taken napping in the Flood,</L>
<L>Had first said Grace, and then become their Food:</L>
<L>Yea, and his Sacred Shell had been preferr'd</L>
<L>To make fine Combs for <HI>Wilgefortu</HI> Beard.</L>
<L>And who can tell (for now 'tis Thirty Years</L>
<L>Since this strange Expedition from <HI>Algiers)</HI></L>
<L>What Use the Fryars of <HI>Mayork</HI> have made</L>
<L>Of the poor Skiff to raise their Legend Trade?</L>

<L>But, be it as it will; Buy, or not Buy;</L>
<L>This Book is Protestant, and hates a Lye.</L>
<L>The Reader shall find in this Breviary</L>
<L>All <HI>Pater Nosters,</HI> not one <HI>Ave Mary.</HI></L>
<L>If Gentleman and Christian may avail,</L>

<L>For this poor Pilgrims Truth and Faithfulness,</L>
<L>It may with Leave and safety past the Press.</L>
<L>Let him who scorns to Read, or Reads to Scorn,</L>

<HEAD>A
PREFACE
To the following
NARRATIVE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO readily agree with thee, that there
is no sort of Writings more lyable to
abuse than this of the <HI>Narrative:</HI> Ly∣ing
much at the Mercy of the <HI>Compo∣ser</HI>
to be Corrupted; and as much in dan∣ger
to be mis-improved by the <HI>Reader:</HI> The
<HI>Reader</HI> therefore I am sure will demand good
<HI>Security</HI> that he is not imposed upon in the
ensuing <HI>Relation,</HI> and the <HI>Writer</HI> craves leave
too, to maintain <HI>a modest Jealousie,</HI> lest the
<HI>Reader</HI> should miss the benefit that is design∣ed
to him in it: The <HI>Author</HI> will engage,
and pawn his Credit <HI>not to wrong the Narra∣tive,</HI>
and he would take some care also that
the <HI>Reader</HI> may <HI>not wrong himself.</HI></P>
<P>It is very true, that <HI>every Narrator</HI> is un∣der
a strong Temptation to <HI>Season</HI> his Dis∣course
to the <HI>Gusto</HI> of the Time, not impo∣sing
<PB REF="6"/>
a severe Law upon himself, to <HI>Report</HI>
what is true, but accomodating his Story to
the Liquorish Appetite of others: I have ob∣served
that <HI>some Men</HI> are ashamed to <HI>Recount
mean and humble Matters;</HI> if they bring us
any thing below <HI>Prodigy and Miracle;</HI> if they
stuff not their Farces with <HI>Gorgons, Harpies,
Centaures, and Enchanted Islands,</HI> they nei∣ther
please themselves, nor hope to take their
<HI>Readers</HI> by the <HI>Heart-strings.</HI> Hence it is,
that we have so many lean, barren <HI>Stories,</HI>
larded with the Additaments of Fruitful In∣vention,
as if they had been Penn'd by the
Pattern of <HI>Xenophon's Cyrus. Non ad Historiae
fidem, sed ad justi Imperii Exemplar:</HI> Not
for <HI>Counter-panes of Truth,</HI> but <HI>Counterfeits
of Fancy:</HI> They tell us not what was <HI>really
done,</HI> but what they <HI>would have had done,</HI> if
they might have had the Contrivance of <HI>the
Scene and Tragedy:</HI> They first form <HI>Idaea's</HI>
of <HI>Ingenious Romances</HI> in their own Heads,
and then obtrude them upon the World for
<HI>Historical Verieties.</HI></P>
<P>Just as our <HI>Hydrographers</HI> in the Delineat∣ing
of <HI>Countries,</HI> with one wanton <HI>Extrava∣gant
Frolick</HI> of their <HI>Graver</HI> can raise <HI>Moun∣tains,</HI>
where Nature left us <HI>Vallies;</HI> and sink
<HI>deep Vallies,</HI> where God has stretch'd out a
<HI>Champagn;</HI> can create <HI>Bays, and Creeks,</HI>
where the <HI>Creator</HI> made <HI>firm Land;</HI> and jut
out <HI>Promontories, and Capes,</HI> where there's
<PB REF="6"/>
nothing in <HI>Nature</HI> to answer them; and to
fill up <HI>Vacuities</HI> (out of pure good <HI>Husband∣ry,</HI>
that not an inch of <HI>Ground</HI> may be lost)
present us with <HI>Flying Fishes, Tritons,</HI> and
<HI>Mermaids,</HI> which spend their hours <HI>inter Pe∣ctinem
&amp; Speculum;</HI> and lest <HI>Mare del zur</HI>
should still be a Desolate Wilderness, have
courteously stock'd it with <HI>the Painter's
Wifes Island,</HI> and <HI>Terra Incognita;</HI> at this
rate are we dealt with, by this kind of Men,
who love to blow up <HI>lank sttories</HI> into huge
<HI>Bladders,</HI> and then put something in them to
make them <HI>Rattle</HI> to please <HI>Children,</HI> and
yet they are <HI>but Bladders still,</HI> though swel∣led
with the <HI>Tympany,</HI> and <HI>Wind-Cholick.</HI></P>
<P>There are also a sort of <HI>Stories,</HI> which, <HI>by
the way of Courtesie,</HI> we mis-call <HI>Histories,</HI>
that scorn to give us an account of any thing
but <HI>dreadful, and terrible Battels,</HI> and how
one great Man above all the rest, chopt off
<HI>Heads</HI> and <HI>Arms,</HI> and cut off some sheer by
the <HI>Waste,</HI> and with his <HI>Trenchant-blade</HI> mow∣ed
down <HI>whole Files of Armed Enemies;</HI> the
Fields all this while running with streams of
Blood, and purple Gore; and all this, with
as much confidence, and exactness in every
<HI>Minute Circumstance,</HI> as if, like the Familiar
<HI>Daemon</HI> of <HI>Paracelsus,</HI> they had been inclo∣sed
in <HI>the pommel</HI> of the <HI>General's Sword;</HI> or
had hover'd, like <HI>Victory with her doubtful
Wings,</HI> over both the <HI>Armies,</HI> where they
<PB REF="7"/>
might securely take notes of all that was <HI>said</HI>
or <HI>done,</HI> in <HI>Shelton</HI>'s <HI>Brachygraphy:</HI> but from
what <HI>Principles</HI> or <HI>Interests</HI> these <HI>Warriers</HI>
were <HI>Acted;</HI> by what <HI>Rules</HI> they <HI>proceeded,</HI>
with what <HI>Councels</HI> and <HI>Intrigues,</HI> designs
were <HI>managed;</HI> and to what <HI>Point</HI> all these
<HI>Policies steered;</HI> is as much <HI>below their Spirits</HI>
as <HI>above their Abilities,</HI> to inform us.</P>
<P>To secure the <HI>Reader</HI> against the fear of
such Entertainment in this <HI>Narrative,</HI> let
him know, that he shall meet with nothing
<HI>in Fact</HI> but what is <HI>precisely true;</HI> what of
<HI>wonderment</HI> he may Encounter, was of <HI>God's
own working,</HI> not of <HI>Man's inventing;</HI> let others
make <HI>Tragedies</HI> to gratifie the <HI>Book-seller,</HI> and
cheat the simple <HI>Buyer;</HI> we need not <HI>Peter
Lillicrap</HI>'s <HI>Essex Serpent,</HI> nor <HI>Livewell Chap∣man</HI>'s
<HI>Greater Monsters,</HI> to <HI>Aggrandize</HI> our
<HI>Title Page;</HI> God's Works need no <HI>foyl</HI> to set
them off, the greatest <HI>Beauty of Truth,</HI> is its
<HI>nakedness,</HI> and <HI>Symmetry.</HI></P>
<P>There is a vast difference <HI>between</HI> the <HI>most
elaborate products</HI> of <HI>Art,</HI> and the most <HI>homely
pieces of Nature;</HI> for though <HI>the former</HI> will
needs <HI>Ape</HI> the <HI>latter,</HI> yet how pitifully does
<HI>she bungle in the imitation!</HI> Look upon <HI>the
subtle Point of the finest Needle</HI> through a
<HI>Microscope,</HI> and you will soon be satisfied
that <HI>Art is but a Dunce,</HI> for the <HI>Needle</HI> will
appear as <HI>blunt, and dull</HI> as a <HI>Drum-stick;</HI> but
come and view one of Gods Handy-works in
<PB REF="7"/>
the same Glass, <HI>V. G. The sting of a Bee,</HI> and
you shall see it perpetually Acuminated till
it ends in <HI>something,</HI> which the Eye must
either confess to be a <HI>Point,</HI> or <HI>Nothing;</HI> The
same difference we may observe between
those <HI>Romances,</HI> which are the <HI>Issues</HI> of <HI>fine
Wits,</HI> and the <HI>serious, grave Contrivances</HI> of
<HI>Divine Providence;</HI> what <HI>clumz'd things</HI>
are the <HI>Cassandra's</HI> to one of those <HI>pieces of
proportion,</HI> to be seen in <HI>God's Government of
this lower World!</HI> So that it were <HI>unpardonable</HI>
to strive <HI>to Recommend</HI> the wonderful Provi∣dences
of God to the <HI>Genius</HI> of this <HI>Age, by
a Lye,</HI> or to <HI>talk deceitfully for him;</HI> what∣ever
therefore this <HI>Narrative</HI> is, yet it's a <HI>na∣ked
Account of his own workings; and Gold
needs no Gilding.</HI></P>
<P>But now the <HI>Readers great danger</HI> lies in
running over some of <HI>God's Works,</HI> and yet
not seeing <HI>God in his Works:</HI> Little Chil∣dren,
we see, do hugely please themselves
with the <HI>Gilded Covers,</HI> and <HI>Marbled Leaves</HI>
of Books, but concern not themselves, <HI>what
is within;</HI> and if they chance to look a little
overly upon <HI>the forms and shapes of the Let∣ters,</HI>
yet understand not the <HI>sublime matter,</HI>
that may be coucht in them: Now, to divide
<HI>the words</HI> from <HI>the meaning,</HI> is morally to
<HI>Annihilate</HI> them, and so whilst they see <HI>Let∣ters,</HI>
and <HI>Words</HI> only, they see just <HI>Nothing:</HI>
There are a great many such <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<PB REF="8"/>
such <HI>Old Children</HI> in the World, that gaze
upon <HI>the surface of Gods Works,</HI> but never
are led <HI>by them</HI> to admire <HI>the Wisdom, Pow∣er,
Goodness, and Holiness</HI> of God: They
deal with <HI>the Works of Providence,</HI> just as
they do with <HI>the Works of Creation:</HI> God
has Ingraven <HI>his own Name</HI> in Legible Cha∣racters
upon <HI>the Heavenly Bodies.</HI> The Stars
in their <HI>single Beauties,</HI> their <HI>Combined Aste∣risms,</HI>
their <HI>Mutual Aspects,</HI> their <HI>Intricate,</HI>
yet <HI>Regular Motions,</HI> speak their <HI>Author;</HI>
nay, upon the lowest <HI>Recreations,</HI> the <HI>Lei∣sure-sports</HI>
of <HI>Nature,</HI> there is written, <HI>Deus
fecit.</HI> But now the common observer,
whose <HI>thoughts</HI> are terminated by his <HI>Eye,</HI>
and his <HI>Eye</HI> with the <HI>visible Heavens,</HI> as 'tis
bespangled with glittering things, called
<HI>Planets,</HI> and <HI>Stars,</HI> loseth quite their main
<HI>design,</HI> which is to conduct and argue our
thoughts up to a first <HI>Cause;</HI> for they were
not so much out who cryed up <HI>the Musick
of the Sphaeres</HI> to be so <HI>Ravishing:</HI> and we
should confess it, could we but hear them
Sing this <HI>Antheme, Glory be to God on High.</HI>
Can we be so Bruitish, as once to imagine,
that the wise God, who creates <HI>nothing little,</HI>
nor for a <HI>little end,</HI> should create such <HI>great,
and glorious Bodies</HI> only <HI>to</HI> be <HI>the Objects</HI> of
<HI>Ignorant,</HI> and <HI>Blind Amazement?</HI> Surely
no; <HI>but that</HI> by <HI>the contemplation of them,</HI>
we <HI>might</HI> be led <HI>into the Admiration of Him,</HI>
<PB REF="8"/>
whose Being, Wisdom, Power must needs
be <HI>infinitely Glorious,</HI> when his very works
are <HI>excellently so:</HI> Here then will be <HI>the
Readers</HI> danger, lest all his <HI>Spirits</HI> should
evaporate in a confused <HI>Admiration, that a
Boat, a little, a Canvas Boat</HI> should, like <HI>the</HI>
Ark, convey so many Persons so many
Leagues safe a Shoar, whilst he misses <HI>the</HI>
true <HI>intent,</HI> and <HI>meaning of it, to</HI> behold a

and in all thy ways to acknowledge God, <HI>who
by</HI> the most contemptible means, <HI>can effect</HI>
the most <HI>considerable</HI> things. <HI>Created Be∣ings,
as</HI> they cannot <HI>act beyond</HI> the Sphere
<HI>of their</HI> Activity, <HI>so neither can</HI> they <HI>Operate
further</HI> than the suitableness of <HI>their</HI> Instru∣ments
<HI>will enable</HI> them; it <HI>were ridiculous</HI>
to attempt to cut down a <HI>Forrest</HI> with a Pen-knife,
<HI>or</HI> Lave the Ocean with a Spoon; but
if the <HI>great God can make</HI> the dullest Tool to
cut, <HI>can serve himself of</HI> the most unfit In∣struments,
<HI>and accomplish</HI> the most Noble
Works <HI>with</HI> the most Wooden Engines, <HI>he will
sure deserve our</HI> greatest trust and confidence.

not because he cannot work without them,
but to teach us to <HI>admire his</HI> strength, <HI>in their</HI>
weakness, <HI>his</HI> All-sufficiency <HI>in their</HI> insuffi∣ciency.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> had heard of the fa∣mous
<HI>Atchievemen</HI> of <HI>Castriots Scimitar,</HI>
and was very desirous to make an Experi∣ment,
whether <HI>its excellency</HI> answered <HI>the
Report;</HI> he sends for <HI>it,</HI> proves <HI>it, it</HI> does no
<HI>Execution;</HI> he sends <HI>it</HI> back <HI>with</HI> scorn, and
indignation, <HI>that</HI> lying Fame should magni∣fie
a sorry <HI>Ammunition Sword</HI> so far above
its merits, but <HI>Scanderbeg,</HI> before the Mes∣senger's
Face, hews in pieces <HI>Helmets, Cor∣slets;</HI>

<HI>Though I sent him my Sword, I did not
send him my Arm;</HI> none can work with <HI>God's
means, that has not God's Arm: Hast thou an
Arm like God?</HI> Job 40. 9. Here <HI>then the
Reader</HI> may <HI>see,</HI> (and if he <HI>sees not,</HI> he for∣feits
<HI>his Eyes)</HI> the same God who in an <HI>Ark
of Bulrushes</HI> preserved <HI>Moses,</HI> and in ano∣ther

<P>Indeed our whole passage was <HI>wonder;</HI>
suppose we had met with one <HI>Night of Hazy
Weather,</HI> we might have plyed <HI>back into the</HI>
jaws of <HI>that Destruction</HI> which we had so far
escaped. Had we <HI>met with</HI> one Storm (and
an ordinary puff of wind had been a Storm
to us) <HI>it</HI> had presently <HI>over-set</HI> us; <HI>but the</HI>
same God <HI>that</HI> commands a calm for <HI>the
Halcyon,</HI> commanded <HI>Halcyon Days and
Nights</HI> for us, <HI>till</HI> under <HI>the wings of his</HI> Gra∣cious
care he had <HI>hatcht his own purposes</HI> of
Mercy, <HI>into</HI> perfect Deliverance. It <HI>was a
wonder too,</HI> that in our six Days <HI>Voyage,</HI> in the
<HI>Mediterranean,</HI> the very <HI>High Road</HI> of <HI>Na∣vigation,</HI>
both for <HI>honest Men and Knaves,
Merchants</HI> and <HI>Pirates,</HI> we should not meet
with one <HI>Vessel,</HI> Friend or Foe: Had we met
with a Friend's <HI>Vessel,</HI> they had pityed us,
<PB REF="10"/>
taken us up, and <HI>then the</HI> Power of God had
not <HI>been so signalized</HI> in our Preservation;
had we fallen in <HI>with</HI> an <HI>Enemy,</HI> we had <HI>im∣mediately
become a</HI> Prey <HI>to their Teeth,</HI> they
had <HI>swallowed us up quick,</HI> we had made <HI>but
one poor Morsel</HI> to their greedy <HI>Stomachs, and</HI>
thereby <HI>defeated</HI> a work of God gloriously
begun, and rob'd him of <HI>the Revenue</HI> of his
praise.</P>
<P>If then they that go down to the Sea in Ships,
see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the

Miracles <HI>of Providence have</HI> we seen, <HI>and
many others</HI> see <HI>in us,</HI> who went down to the Sea,
<HI>not in a</HI> Ship, <HI>but in a</HI> Canoe, <HI>which for</HI> want
<HI>of a better</HI> Name <HI>we call a</HI> Boat! <HI>Let</HI> the
Reader <HI>therefore admire God with me; and
both of us with</HI> the Psalmist, <HI>Psal. 86. 8.</HI> A∣mong
the Gods there is none like unto thee, O

<P><HI>He deals unrighteously with God, who
measures him: by</HI> the smallness of the means

2. Sect. <HI>Let</HI> the Reader <HI>improve</HI> this Re∣lation
to fortisie his Faith against the little
Cavils of Atheistical Spirits, <HI>who lay out
their</HI> ill placed wit <HI>in forgeing</HI> Objections
against Him that gave it. <HI>There is a Creature
famous in</HI> Prov. 6. Qui lacte Materno imple∣tus
calcibus petit Lactantem, that being filled
with the liberal Dug, ungratefully kicks his
Dam. <HI>Thus this sort of Men are ambitious
to be</HI> accounted witty, <HI>in creating</HI> knots and
difficulties <HI>in</HI> the <HI>Historical passages of</HI> Gods
<HI>great Providences Recorded in Scripture,
and particularly</HI> in his <HI>preservation of</HI> Noah,
and his Family in the Ark: <HI>But he that had
seen</HI> with us the watchful Eye of God <HI>super∣intended,
and</HI> the steddy hand of God to hold
<HI>a poor</HI> Canvas Boat, <HI>built without Regular
proportion, ill</HI> Victualled, <HI>without</HI> Anchor,
Helm, Compass, <HI>or</HI> Tackle, <HI>and thereby pre∣serve
the Lives of five inconsiderable per∣sons,
of no great</HI> use in the <HI>World, and after
six Days great extremity and distress,</HI> Land
them all safe, may easily <HI>Credit</HI> the <HI>Report,
how</HI> the same God should <HI>preserve eight Per∣sons,
upon whose</HI> Lives the <HI>re-peopling of</HI>
the whole World did depend, in a Vessel of most
exact proportions, strong built, and well laid in
with all manner of Provisions. <HI>He that can
see a Creator in the works of Creation, and
a Governor in the works of Providence,</HI>
may reasonably believe all Divine Revelations.</P>
<P><PB REF="11"/>
3. <HI>Sect.</HI> Let all <HI>that would not abuse this
Narrative</HI> beware, <HI>lest whilst they are admi∣ring
Providence in this instance, if our preser∣vation,
they do not over-look those eminent ap∣pearances
of God towards themselves every mo∣ment,</HI>
which, though perhaps they carry
not <HI>so much of</HI> Rarity in them, yet may
have in <HI>them, as much of</HI> real power, wisdom,
and goodness. We are <HI>apt to deal with</HI> our
Mercies, <HI>just as we do with</HI> our Sins, where
<HI>the commonness and frequency of</HI> either, abates
and takes off from <HI>the Observation and No∣tice</HI>
which we owe them; we gaze, and
wonder at <HI>Comets,</HI> and their <HI>Flaming Beards,</HI>
but seldome admire the <HI>Sun,</HI> a far more
Glorious Body, because he rises and sets
every Morning and Evening <HI>upon the just
and the unjust;</HI> Dost thou admire God in
our preservation, learn to admire him in
thy own: Art thou surprized with won∣der,
<HI>that we were kept a few Days,</HI> when there
<HI>was not half an inch between us and Death?</HI>
Consider, God has <HI>kept thee many Days,</HI> and
<HI>many Years,,</HI> and <HI>every minute of those many
Days and Years,</HI> when there was <HI>but a hairs
breadth between thee and Death:</HI> Dost thou
then admire God preserved us alive in a
<HI>Vessel of Cloth?</HI> Admire that God that <HI>hold∣eth
thy Soul in Life,</HI> and that in a more frail
<HI>Vessel,</HI> a <HI>Vessel of Clay:</HI> Dost thou still won∣der
we were not blown over with every
<PB REF="11"/>
<HI>breath of Wind?</HI> Admire also <HI>that the Lamp
of thy Life</HI> which thou carriest in a Paper-Lanthorn,
is not blown out by every <HI>blast
of Sickness:</HI> But if thou wilt still wonder
how <HI>such a Boat</HI> should carry us? Then
wonder also how <HI>thy Food nourishes thee,</HI> how
<HI>thy Cloaths keep thee warm,</HI> how <HI>thy sleep re∣freshes
thee:</HI> There's not a <HI>moment</HI> in our
<HI>Lives but is filled with</HI> real Miracle and Won∣der.
<HI>I will Praise thee</HI> (saies the <HI>Psalmist,</HI>
Psal. 139. 14.) <HI>for I am fearfully and wonder∣fully
made:</HI> Let us all Praise God, <HI>for we
are fearfully and wonderfull preserved.</HI> If
Preservation be but a continued Creation,
how should we adore that Power that Crea∣ted
us once, but preserves us alwaies! God
expects that we should equally magnifie his
skill in making us <HI>out of Nothing,</HI> and secu∣ring
us that we drop not <HI>into Nothing:</HI> and
as much admire his goodness, <HI>that we crum∣ble
not, moulder not into our Dust,</HI> as that we
were at first <HI>formed out of Dust.</HI></P>
<P>4. <HI>Sect.</HI> Let the <HI>Reader</HI> learn from our
Slavery, to prize, and improve <HI>his own Liber∣ty.</HI>
If we serve not our God sincerely, and
chearfully <HI>in plenty,</HI> he can send us where
we shall serve our Enemies <HI>in want.</HI> If we
glorifie him not with our Liberty, but turn
it <HI>into licentiousness,</HI> he can <HI>clap us up close,</HI>
where we shall learn to prize it higher, and
wish we had improved it better. It argues
<PB REF="12"/>
great <HI>disinginuity and baseness</HI> in our Spirits,
that we provoke our God to teach us the worth
of Mercies by the want of them: <HI>The Lord
does not willingly afflict, nor grieve the Children
of Men,</HI> Lam. 3. 33. but we provoke him to
take his Rod into his hand, and lay it smart∣ly
upon our backs, <HI>because that Folly which
is bound up in our Hearts will not otherwise be
lasht out of us.</HI> Thus God threatned his peo∣ple
of Old, <HI>Deut. 28. 48. Because thou ser∣vedst
not the Lord thy God with joyfulness and
gladness of Heart, for the abundance of all
things, therefore shalt thou serve thine Ene∣mies,
in hunger, thirst, and nakedness, and in
the want of all things.</HI> Thus he taught <HI>Ju∣dah</HI>
by <HI>the Captivity of Babylon,</HI> to prize the
freedom of <HI>Canaan;</HI> we might learn our
Duty much cheaper from Gods Word, but
we like <HI>Truants,</HI> will not learn it there, till
God sends us to <HI>School</HI> with a Rod at our
backs.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Sect.</HI> Let all Learn from hence, <HI>in what
State soever the Providence of God shall place
them, therewith to be content:</HI> Perhaps thou
art a Servant to a Christian; dost thou
murmur? It shews, thou little knowest
what it is to be a Slave to an imperious <HI>Turk.</HI>
Thou servest him that Prays with thee, and
for thee: dost thou repine? God might have
made thee serve one who would <HI>Curse and
Torture thee,</HI> and make little Provision for
<PB REF="12"/>
thy <HI>Body,</HI> and none at all for thy <HI>Soul:</HI> The
Christian Religion is surely <HI>the most excellent</HI>
Religion in <HI>the</HI> World, <HI>because it holds the
ballance so even between</HI> Superiours <HI>and</HI> Infe∣riours:
It enjoyns <HI>the one</HI> to give the most
full <HI>Obedience,</HI> and yet prohibits the other
to exercise Rigour. It is peremptory for
<HI>Duty,</HI> and yet abhors <HI>Tyranny:</HI> whoever has
known <HI>Turkish Slavery,</HI> is obliged to become
a more <HI>Loyal Subject,</HI> a more <HI>Dutiful Child,</HI>
a more <HI>Faithful Servant;</HI> and whoever has
not known it, is yet obliged to become all
these, lest God make him know it, and
whip out of him that Restiff Spirit of grumb∣ling,
and Disobedience with the Briars, and
Thorns of the Wilderness.</P>
<P>God commanded all Masters among the
<HI>Jews,</HI> to allow their Servants a Day of Rest,
<HI>Deut. 5. 14.</HI> and he gives this Reason for it,
<HI>Remember that thou wast a Servant in the
Land of Egypt.</HI> The Equity of which Rea∣son
holds stronger for the Christian: <HI>Re∣member
thou wast a Servant to the worst of Ma∣sters,
a Drudge in the basest of works, and ly∣able
to receive the worst of Wages:</HI> Has Christ
set thee free? And art thou become a Ser∣vant
to the best of Masters? Employed in
the most reasonable, and honourable Ser∣vices?
<HI>And in expectation of the most</HI> glorious
Rewards? Let it teach thee <HI>if thou beest a Ma∣ster,
to command gently; and if a Servant, to
obey chearfully.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="13"/>
6. <HI>Sect.</HI> Let all Learn <HI>to walk worthy of the
Gospel.</HI> It is that which sweetens all our
mercies, and mitigates the bitterness of all
Afflictions; and if we sin away that, we ei∣ther
sin away all the rest, or whatever is
useful, and desireable in all the rest. If we
enjoy the Light, and yet walk in darkness,
it's righteous with God, to over-spread our
<HI>Habitations with Egyptian,</HI> or <HI>Babylonish, Tur∣kish,</HI>
or <HI>Popish</HI> darkness. God can carry us
<HI>to Rome,</HI> or <HI>Algiers;</HI> or else send <HI>Rome,</HI> and
<HI>Algiers</HI> home to us: For what should a
a People do with Light, that only intend
to play, or fight by it? The once Famous
Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> are now swallowed up by
the <HI>Ottoman Sword,</HI> and the <HI>Mahumetan Ʋn∣belief;</HI>
and those sometimes Famous Ci∣ties,
<HI>Carthage,</HI> and <HI>Hippo,</HI> which knew those
burning and shining Lights, <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and
<HI>Augustine,</HI> are now possest with <HI>Moors,</HI> and
defiled with the Abominations of the great∣est
Impostor that ever seduced the <HI>Nations,</HI>
but <HI>One.</HI> And thinkest thou, O Man, O
Christian, <HI>that do'st these things,</HI> so Alien
from the Gospel of Christ; that art drunk
in the day, and cursest that God whom thou
Worshippest, <HI>that thou shalt escape the Judg∣ment
of God?</HI> I tell thee, nay; and I tell all
those that read these lines, and are guilty;
and I tell my self, <HI>so far as I am guilty, that
except we repent, we shall all likewise perish.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="13"/>
The <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> in his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the
Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> gives her this <HI>Memorial, Rev.
2. 5. Remember therefore from whence thou art
fallen, and Repent, and do thy first work, or else
I will come unto thee quickly, and remove thy Can∣dlestick
out of its place, except thou Repent:</HI> But
<HI>Ephesus would none of his Counsel, none of his
Caution;</HI> and Christ was as good as his word, he
put out her <HI>Candle, and removed her Candlestick.</HI>
I have often wondered, what should be the
grounds of their confidence, who speak as if the
<HI>Gospel were entailed upon England,</HI> by vertue of
<HI>some Ancient Charter;</HI> as if God would make <HI>us
Exceptions from his General Rule,</HI> which is <HI>to take
away abused, despised means, and mercies,</HI> and
we must own much of <HI>prerogative in our case;</HI>
but yet let us <HI>Rejoyce with trembling,</HI> lest when
<HI>Prophaneness</HI> and <HI>Debauchery</HI> dog Religion so
close at the <HI>heels,</HI> she fly not thither, where she
may find better Quarter: It has made great
Impression upon me when I read the Divine

<P>7. <HI>Sect.</HI> Let it be every <HI>Man</HI>'s <HI>care to be found
in Gods way:</HI> The <HI>Promise</HI> of Protection is an∣next
to <HI>Gods way,</HI> Psal. 91. 11. <HI>He shall give his
Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways:</HI>
And the Blessing of God is annext to <HI>to his own
way too,</HI> Psal. 128. 1. <HI>Blessed is every one that
feareth God, and walketh in his ways.</HI> When we
are over-taken <HI>with the evil of Affliction,</HI> let the
first <HI>Question</HI> we propound to our selves be this.
Am I not in <HI>the way of Transgression?</HI> Did <HI>this
danger</HI> find me in my <HI>Duty?</HI> Was I in <HI>Gods
High-way,</HI> or in some <HI>by path of my own?</HI> Was
I doing <HI>his work?</HI> Serving <HI>his Glory?</HI> If we
observe not the way of <HI>his Precepts,</HI> I know no
Reason we should plead the <HI>Promise</HI> of his Pro∣tection.
There are two things upon which
I look upon it as my great Duty to Reflect;
First, whether we were <HI>in the way Gods Precepts</HI>
when we fell into our Enemies Hands? Se∣condly,
whether we were <HI>in the way of Gods Pro∣mise</HI>
when we escaped out of their Hands? For
the former, I am abundantly satisfied, <HI>that we
were in the way of our Duty;</HI> for we were sent
out by Commission from the Right Honour,
able, <HI>Robert,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> the Lord <HI>Say,</HI>
and the Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> who by Patent from Hi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Majesty
<PB REF="14"/>
King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, were Govern∣ours
of <HI>the Isle of Providence, whither we were
bound:</HI> For the latter, If the more severe <HI>Rea∣der</HI>
shall make it a <HI>Question, Whether we could
in Faith expect Protection in an Adventure visibly
so rash, and praecipitous?</HI> And shall determine
it against us, that we <HI>tempted God</HI> by casting
<HI>our selves upon extraordinary Protection,</HI> expect∣ing
deliverance without warrant, <HI>in a way little
on this side miracle:</HI> I shall first say, Let him shun
<HI>that Rock</HI> in his own Conversation, upon <HI>which
he supposes us to have dasht:</HI> Let our <HI>Ship-wrack</HI>
be a <HI>Buoy</HI> to warn him of <HI>the</HI> like <HI>presumption,</HI>
and let him learn more <HI>wisdom,</HI> at our <HI>cost</HI> and
<HI>charges.</HI> I shall further say, let him not disco∣ver
greater rashness in censuring our <HI>Adventure,</HI>
then he charges upon our <HI>Adventure,</HI> but
modestly consider <HI>himself, lest he also be
tempted:</HI> and if we were <HI>guilty of folly,</HI> he may
<HI>thus gain wisdom</HI> by our <HI>folly.</HI> But I shall add,
<HI>Extremity of Misery is none of the best Counsellers;</HI>
let him put himself under our Circumstances,
and if Cowardise did not hinder him from ma∣king
our Attempt, I am confident Conscience
would not: Our Lives were bitter <HI>to us by Rea∣son
of cruel Bondage,</HI> and <HI>(though mine was at that
time much mitigated)</HI> yet there is a <HI>secret Mag∣netisme</HI>
in a <HI>Native Soil,</HI> with which our <HI>Hearts
being once strongly toucht,</HI> could never admit of
<HI>the leact variation,</HI> but still pointed directly
Homewards; and such a <HI>Land too, as was like
<PB REF="15"/>
Goshen, all Light,</HI> when the <HI>Land of</HI> our <HI>Captivity</HI>
was like <HI>Egypt,</HI> both for <HI>Slavery</HI> and <HI>Darkness,</HI>
that might <HI>both be felt;</HI> and we thought it be∣low

of our Lives,</HI> for</P>

<P>In a word, <HI>though success will not</HI> warrant <HI>an
evil Action,</HI> yet there's much of <HI>justification in
it,</HI> on the <HI>behalf of those which are not so;</HI> nor
did we <HI>tempt God</HI> to work <HI>Miracles,</HI> but trusted
him to afford us <HI>special Protection;</HI> But if this
will not satisfie, <HI>let none imitate us wherein we
failed,</HI> but rather admire <HI>Divine Condescention,</HI>
that engaged in our Deliverance, <HI>notwithstand∣ing
our failing.</HI></P>
<P>8. <HI>Sect.</HI> Let all that read this <HI>Narrative</HI> be
<HI>instructed never to promise them selves great mat∣ters
from Men:</HI> I have observed it in the whole
course of our <HI>Captivity,</HI> and constant Tenour
of <HI>those Gracious Providences which brought us
thence,</HI> and the <HI>Series of Mercy, Wisdom,</HI> and
<HI>Power, that was our Convoy Home,</HI> that we ever
found most of Favour from God, when we ex∣pected
least from Men: <HI>and the least of kind∣ness</HI>
from those where <HI>we might,</HI> or <HI>thought we
might</HI> in Reason have promised our selves
most. When we <HI>met with unexpected Friend∣ship,
<PB REF="15"/>
God would teach us to own himself.</HI> When
we met with <HI>dis-appointment,</HI> God would teach
us <HI>the folly of Idolizing the Creature:</HI> I have se∣riously
admired the <HI>Compassion and Relief we
found at Mayork,</HI> and yet we knew them to be
<HI>Romanists,</HI> and they knew us to be <HI>Protestants,</HI>
and <HI>haw little respect</HI> we found <HI>frome some of our
own Countrey,</HI> at <HI>Alicant, Cadiz,</HI> and St. <HI>Lucars,</HI>
and yet we were tyed together in the strictest
<HI>Triple Bonds</HI> of <HI>Ʋn Dieu, Ʋn Roy, Ʋn Ley, One
God, One King, One Law:</HI> But God was seen in
both. I could Relate a Passage during our
<HI>Captivity</HI> in <HI>Algiers,</HI> that had more of bitter∣ness
in it, than in all our Slavery; and yet
they were <HI>Christians,</HI> not <HI>Algerines; Protestants,</HI>
not <HI>Papists; English-men,</HI> not <HI>Strangers,</HI> that
were the cause of it: But I have put a force
upon my self, and am resolved not to publish
it. In our Return homewards, we met with
some <HI>who would talk to the grief of those whom
God had wounded, and was now in a way to heal
again.</HI> Some would interpretatively say, with
the Churlish <HI>Nabal,</HI> 1 Sam. 25. 10. Who are
these? And whence come they? <HI>There are ma∣ny
Servants now adays that break away, every one
from his Master.</HI> But then was the season when
we had most Experience of Gods faithfulness:
And I shall never cease to own before the World
the great Respect we found from some <HI>English</HI>
Merchants, to whom we were perfect Stran∣gers;
and the Civilities of Captain <HI>Goodson,</HI>
<PB REF="16"/>
Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> his <HI>Mate,</HI> and his <HI>Son,</HI> are not
to be forgotten.</P>
<P><HI>Perhaps, after all this, the</HI> Reader <HI>will be</HI>
earnest to be satisfied, <HI>why this</HI> Narrative <HI>has</HI>
lain so long Dormant, and appeared no sooner in
the World? <HI>And I shall herein also endeavour</HI>
to give him all Reasonable satisfaction.</P>
<P>1. <HI>When we return'd into</HI> England, <HI>we
found our Native Country</HI> embroyled in a Civil
War, <HI>and most Men had enough to do,</HI> to bear
their own personal Calamities, <HI>and had little
need to be troubled with</HI> the miseries of others;
they were other kind of Declarations that flew a∣broad
then, and that was enough to super-sede a
Narrative of this Nature, for some Years.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>great Mercies of God</HI> have not al∣waies
<HI>their due weight</HI> upon our Hearts <HI>at first;</HI>
and I have received <HI>signal Deliverances</HI> from
eminent dangers <HI>since that great one;</HI> and it's
well if all the mercies of our Lives, all our De∣liverances
put together, will <HI>amount to an Ar∣gument
strong enough to overcome our backwardness
to make publick acknowledgments.</HI></P>
<P>3. I thought a long while that <HI>it was not worth
the while,</HI> to trouble the World <HI>with my parti∣cular
Concerns,</HI> till the <HI>Importunity of several Mi∣nisters,
and others,</HI> both in City and Country,
overcame my reluctancy, in whose Reasons I
did acquiesce.</P>
<P>4. I was conscious to my self <HI>of great unfit∣ness</HI>
to recommend <HI>it to publick view,</HI> in such a
<PB REF="16"/>
garb as might <HI>vindicate it from Contempt;</HI> for
though it has been drawn out many years <HI>with
my own hand,</HI> and many have had the <HI>perusal
of it, have approved it, and desired it;</HI> yet till I
could prevail with a Friend to teach it <HI>to speak a
little better English,</HI> I could not be perswaded
<HI>to let it walk abroad; The Stuff and Matter is
my own, the Trimming and Form is anothers,</HI> for
whom I must vouch, that he has done the
<HI>Truth, my self, and the Reader Justice.</HI></P>
<P>Having overcome all these difficulties, <HI>I do
here Erect my Ebenezer, as a small Monument of
great Mercy,</HI> and as an <HI>Obligation</HI> upon my <HI>Soul</HI>
to great Duty, and do pray that it may stand as
an <HI>Abiding Witness</HI> for God in my <HI>Conscience;</HI>
that when-ever I am tempted to Sin, I may
have an Answer ready to stop the Mouth of the
<HI>Tempter</HI> with <HI>Indignation; How can I do this
great Evil, and Sin against my good God?</HI> When
I am tempted to distrust, I may encourage my
<HI>Faith</HI> from my own <HI>Narrative,</HI> saying, <HI>Remem∣ber
that God who delivered thee at Sea;</HI> when I
am tempted to murmur, I may suppress those
mutinous thoughts from my own <HI>Narrative,</HI>
saying, <HI>Remember what thou endurest in Algiers.</HI>
When my Heart grows cold, and unthankful,
I may chide, and shame it, from my own
<HI>Narrative,</HI> into gratitude to God; <HI>That God,
who remembred us in our low Estate, for his Mer∣cy
endureth for ever!</HI> who preserved us <HI>at the
Sea,</HI> the <HI>Great Sea; for his Mercy endureth for
<PB REF="17"/>
ever!</HI> and secured us in a <HI>Boat,</HI> a <HI>Contemptible
Boat, for his Mercy endureth for ever!</HI> who gave
us favour in the Eyes of <HI>Strangers, for his Mer∣cy
endureth for ever!</HI> and opened to us the Hearts
of <HI>Enemies; for his Mercy endureth for ever!</HI>
and taught us to look up to his never failing
Mercy, when Friends failed, <HI>for his Mercy en∣dureth
for ever!</HI> who turned us safe to <HI>England,</HI>
for <HI>his mercy endureth for ever!</HI> we called up∣on
him <HI>in the day of Trouble, he delivered us, and
we will glorifie him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reader,</HI> this <HI>Narrative</HI> is true, peruse it seri∣ously,
and let not Vanity tempt thee to say,
<HI>Things might have been better contrived, wiselier
managed;</HI> it was God that did what was <HI>Good</HI>
in <HI>All;</HI> call not his Wisdom in Question, be∣cause
he did not create more wonders to grati∣fie
thy itching Humour; perhaps thou wouldst
have had us been brought over upon a <HI>Floating
Island,</HI> or in a <HI>Whales Belly,</HI> but I do not under∣stand
that the great God is bound to work Mi∣racles
to save Mens longings: God has done
his work well, and none can mend it; for,
<HI>what can the Man do that comes after the King?</HI>
Eccl. 2. 12. <HI>For the matter of Fact</HI> Recorded
herein, <HI>I might safely call God to Record upon my
Soul that I lye not:</HI> The thing is known to ma∣ny,
and has been sifted, and scann'd by such
Eyes and Ears as are not guilty of easie Credu∣lity;
I have Evidence that may storm the most
obstinate unbelief: Mr. <HI>Thomas Saunders,</HI> my
<PB REF="17"/>
Wife's Brother, being in <HI>Mayork</HI> not long af∣ter
we came from thence, saw our <HI>Boat</HI> hang
up <HI>for a Monument</HI> upon the side of <HI>the great
Churh there.</HI> Mr. <HI>Robert Hales,</HI> who was there
1671. assures me he saw the naked Ribs and
Skeleton of it then hanging in the same place.
Now, I assure thee, <HI>Reader,</HI> I should be much
ashamed of my self, if Strangers unconcerned
in my <HI>Personal Deliverances,</HI> should be <HI>so far
concerned</HI> as to preserve a <HI>Memorial</HI> of them,
and yet unthankful I should Erect no <HI>Standard</HI>
or <HI>Piller</HI> as an Evidence of Gods wonderful
appearing for me.</P>
<P>It's true, I am informed by <HI>one, that some af∣firm,</HI>
there are more <HI>Boats hanging up in Ma∣york,
in Memory of some such like escape:</HI> Now,
if others have really escaped the same danger,
by the same means, it greatly confirms our
<HI>Narrative;</HI> and I do heartily rejoyce, <HI>Provi∣dence
has appeared in the same Method for others,
as for our selves:</HI> we never intend to <HI>Monopo∣lize</HI>
Gods Providences to <HI>our sole use and be∣hoof;</HI>
and we rejoyce if our attempt and suc∣cess
may have encouraged others to make <HI>the
like attempt,</HI> and have found the like success;
but I do assert it with great confidence, that
when we were in <HI>Mayork,</HI> there was no such
<HI>Boat hanging up,</HI> but the Inhabitants there en∣tertained
our Deliverance as such whereof they
had no parallel: But if on the other side, these,
or some of these succeeding <HI>Boats</HI> were but <HI>Im∣posture,</HI>
<PB REF="18"/>
then the goodness of God appears <HI>more
remarkable</HI> towards us, that we really were the
Subjects of such wonder <HI>which others</HI> durst <HI>on∣ly
pretend to;</HI> and it sets a lustre upon this <HI>great
Salvation,</HI> which others have thought <HI>so consi∣derable,</HI>
that they judged it worth the while to
<HI>tell a Lye</HI> to entitle themselves <HI>to the Credit of
it;</HI> for <HI>it's Gold and Silver, not Copper, or baser
Metals,</HI> that they who drive the Coyning
Trade, strive to Counterfeit.</P>
<P><HI>Let then every one that reads, understand,</HI> and
seriously sit down, and consider with himself,
whether he has not had <HI>many eminent Personal
Deliverances</HI> in one kind or other, which this
Marvellous Providence of God towards us may
not refresh his Memory withal; and if he shall
hence be taught to blush at his forgetfulness of
lapsed Mercies; if this <HI>Narrative</HI> shall recover
any lost Providencies, and fix them on, and ri∣vet
into his Soul; if he shall find himself
awakened to do thankfulness to God for all his
benefits towards him; let him joyn with me in
ascribing <HI>all the Power,</HI> and therefore <HI>all the
Glory,</HI> to the Almighty, and let him kindly ac∣cept
the assistance of him, who shall reckon it
amongst his other Mercies, to have been Ser∣viceable
to any one in reviving a better frame
of Heart. Iam,</P>

<P>THIS <HI>Narrative</HI> would be <HI>too happy,</HI> if it

Spirits,</HI> that grudge the time that's spent
<HI>in Preface and Introduction;</HI> and such as <HI>these,</HI>

make never the more haste for unreasonable

hands, they may turn over a few leaves, and

Thorns. But to the more judicious and con∣siderate,
it will be acceptable to know how <HI>our
Foot was taken in the Snare,</HI> as well as how <HI>the
Snare was broken, and we delivered.</HI></P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>June,</HI> in the Year of Our
Lord, One Thousand, Six Hundred, Thirty,
and Nine, in pursuance of a Commission from
the Right Honourable, the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI>
the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> we took Ship
at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> in the <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> carrying
Six Guns, Mr. <HI>Boarder</HI> being Master, and <HI>James
Walker</HI> the Masters Mate; the Ship was chiefly
Laden with Linnen and Woollen Cloath, ha∣ving
in her, Seamen and Passengers, above
Sixty, bound for the <HI>Isle of Providence</HI> in the
<HI>West-Indies.</HI> Five Weeks we lay in the <HI>Downs,</HI>
wishing, and waiting for a Wind, and then we
set Sail, and came to Anchor near the <HI>Isle of
Wight;</HI> but by this time all our Beer in the Ship
stunk, and we were forced to throw it over∣board,
and to take in Vinegar to mix with
Water for our Voyage. The next Lord's
Day we set Sail again, and coming between
the Island, and the Main Land, we stuck fast
in the Sands, but the Tide coming in, hove us
off. These Circumstances seem very inconsi∣derable
<PB N="3" REF="19"/>
to those that were not concerned in the
Products of them; but God has given us the
advantage and leisure to see what <HI>great things</HI>
were in the Womb of <HI>these little things.</HI> Had
the Wind stood longer against us, it had been
more for us, and the danger had been past;
had it stood less while against us, it had been
for us too, and we had been gone past the dan∣ger:
But God appoints it the Moment when it
should come about to blow us into the Mouths
of our Enemies: We see the Truth of that,
<HI>Ye know what to pray for:</HI> We prayed for a
<HI>Wind,</HI> and we had a <HI>Whirl-wind:</HI> If we alwaies
knew what mischief the Answer of our Prayers
would do us, we should be glad to eat our
words, and Pray against our Prayers. Denyal
is often the best Answer, and we had need leave
all Petitions to the wisdom of God to be Inter∣preted,
according to his good pleasure, and re∣turned
as they may be good for us, and make
most for his own Glory: we were also taught,
that the Sea may sometimes be our best
Friend, and the Earth our worst Enemy; and
that <HI>nothing can do us good or hurt, but by the
Direction and Commission of the Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>We were now three Ships in Company, and
one of the other I remember, carried Nine
Guns, Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> Master. The Sixth Day
after our setting Sail from the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> by
break of Day in the Morning, we discovered
three Ships about three or four Leagues to <HI>Lee∣ward:</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>
The Masters of our Ships presently con∣sulted,
what was most adviseable; whether to
stay and speak with them, or to make the best
of our way; <HI>at last</HI> (upon what Reasons I know
not) it <HI>was determined that we should stay;</HI> It was
not long <HI>before we discovered those other three
Ships to be Turks Men of War,</HI> who espying their
Prey, endeavoured to come up with us, which
<HI>about Night they affected:</HI> Whilst they were
coming up, the Masters of our Ships <HI>seemed re∣solved
to Fight them,</HI> and accordingly made pre∣paration
to receive them, but in the Night, the
Master and Company of the Ship wherein I
was, <HI>altered their Counsels, let their Resolutions
Dye,</HI> and agreed to run for it; <HI>uncertain Coun∣sels
never produce better success;</HI> when we <HI>might</HI>
have gone, then we would stay; and when
there was no way to escape, then we musts <HI>needs</HI>
attempt it: Had we either at first <HI>Resolved not to
Fight them,</HI> or resolved to Fight, <HI>had prosecuted
our Resolutions lie Men of Courage,</HI> we might,
perhaps, <HI>either have avoided the danger, or brave∣ly
Master'd it.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving us begin
to run, <HI>sent one of their number to Chase us,</HI>
whilst their other two attended the remaining
two of our Company till the Morning. At
break of Day <HI>they began to Fight us,</HI> and after a
short Dispute Boarded us, <HI>and took us all three:</HI>
In the <HI>Mary,</HI> six were slain, and many wound∣ed;
<HI>so small was the difference between Flight and
Fight;</HI> but that the Death and Wounds of
<PB N="5" REF="20"/>
<HI>those that flye,</HI> are dishonourable; <HI>but of them
that Fight,</HI> beautiful, and Glorious.</P>
<P>Many Weeks <HI>they kept us</HI> close Prisoners at
<HI>Sea!</HI> we found many <HI>Englishmen in their Ships,
Slaves, like our selves,</HI> from whom we had no
<HI>other Comfort,</HI> but the <HI>Condoling</HI> of each others
<HI>Miseries,</HI> and that from them we <HI>learnt a smat∣tering
of the Common Language,</HI> which would
be of <HI>some use to us</HI> when we should <HI>come to Al∣giers,</HI>
whither, after five or six Weeks we were
brought.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Description of Algiers, with their Man∣ner
of Buying, and Selling Slaves.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ALgier</HI> is a City very pleasantly scituated
on the side of the <HI>Hills,</HI> over-looking <HI>the
Mediterranean,</HI> which lyes <HI>North</HI> of it; and it
lifts up its proud <HI>Head</HI> so <HI>Imperiously,</HI> as if it
Challenged a <HI>Soveraignty</HI> over those <HI>Seas,</HI> and
expected <HI>Tribute</HI> from all that shall <HI>look</HI> within
the <HI>Streights.</HI> It lyes in the <HI>30th.</HI> Degree of
<HI>Longitude,</HI> and hath somewhat less than 35
Degrees of <HI>North-Latitude:</HI> The City is con∣siderably
large, the Walls being above three
Miles in <HI>Compass,</HI> beautified and strengthned
with five Gates: <HI>Port-Marine</HI> towards the
<HI>North,</HI> and <HI>Port Piscadore</HI> not far from thence,
and <HI>Porta-Nova</HI> towards the <HI>South;</HI> built, as
they report, by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> whilst it was in
their Possession: The <HI>West-Gate,</HI> which they
call <HI>Bubawite,</HI> and the <HI>Eastern-Gate,</HI> which in
their Tongue is called <HI>Bubazoon:</HI> They have
also several strong Castles besides that upon the
Point of the <HI>Mole,</HI> so that the Town is judged
impregnable. The City is built very stately,
and yet more strong than stately; and more
<PB N="7" REF="21"/>
Famous than strong, <HI>but not</HI> more Famous <HI>for</HI>
any <HI>thing</HI> than for <HI>Infamy,</HI> being the <HI>Retreat, the
Nest</HI> of those <HI>Turkish Corsairs,</HI> which have <HI>long
Tyranniz'd</HI> in, and been a <HI>Terror</HI> to the Neigh∣bouring
<HI>Seas.</HI> It is supposed <HI>by some</HI> to contain
Four Thousand Families, by others, Four∣score
Thousand Persons; <HI>but they must needs be
very short</HI> in their Reckoning, it having been
<HI>Judged,</HI> that of all Nations <HI>there could be</HI> no less
than <HI>Twenty Five Thousand Slaves.</HI> The <HI>Private
Buildings</HI> are very beautiful, flat <HI>Roof'd.</HI> Adorn∣ed
with <HI>Galleries</HI> towards their <HI>Courts,</HI> support∣ed
by <HI>Pillars:</HI> And they may afford to Build
sumptuously, <HI>because they</HI> Build at <HI>other Mens</HI>
cost, and with <HI>other Mens</HI> hands: Their <HI>Tem∣ples</HI>
are also very <HI>Magnificent,</HI> and much too
good for their <HI>Religion,</HI> whose <HI>Practice</HI> and
<HI>Conversation</HI> speaks them to say, <HI>There is no
God.</HI> And yet we Read of a <HI>Religious Thief,</HI>
who never went about <HI>the works of his Calling</HI>
(for so he called stealing) but he would <HI>solemnly
implore the assistance of his Idol;</HI> A strange <HI>God,</HI>
sure; that would be accessary to his <HI>Devoto</HI>'s
<HI>Robberies:</HI> And a strange <HI>Worshipper,</HI> that ei∣ther
hoped to flatter to his God become his Ac∣complice
in <HI>Villany,</HI> with the Vow of a good
round share of the <HI>Booty,</HI> or would be such a
<HI>Fool,</HI> to think that <HI>God</HI> worth the Worship∣ping
that should be thus flatter'd. They have
also many stately <HI>Baths,</HI> to which the <HI>Men</HI> re∣sort
in the <HI>Morning,</HI> and the <HI>Women</HI> in the <HI>Af∣ternoon;</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
But they want one, <HI>worth them all,</HI>
wherein they might by <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI>
was away their filthiness.</P>
<P>To this fair <HI>City</HI> we were brought, yet in our
Eyes it was most ugly and deformed; for the
<HI>French</HI> Proverb is universally true, <HI>Il n'y a
point de bel Prizon. There is no such thing as a
fair Prison.</HI> I confess, for a <HI>Goal,</HI> it's one of
the best Built that I have seen; there's nothing
that the Soul of <HI>Man</HI> bears with more regret
than <HI>Restraint:</HI> The Body it self is judged by
some to be but the Soul's <HI>Little-ease,</HI> or <HI>Cage;</HI>
where though it seems to <HI>Dwell,</HI> yet 'tis but in
<HI>Honourable Durance;</HI> and though it dares not
<HI>break the Prison,</HI> yet it listens; and longs for a
<HI>Goal-Delivery:</HI> There can be nothing large
enough for a Soul but God, from whom since
it once at first came, it must needs be restless
till it return to him again; and surely it has
much forgot it self, and extract, if it can take
up with satisfaction in any thing on this side
its <HI>Creator.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as we were ashore, for the first Night
we were lock'd down in a deep nasty <HI>Cellar;</HI>
some inconveniences we felt, but they were no∣thing
to what we feared: The next day we
were carried, or led, or rather driven to the
<HI>Vice-Roys,</HI> or <HI>Bashaw</HI>'s Palace, who according to
the Custom, and his own Right, is to have
the Tenth Man for his Dividend of the <HI>Slaves.</HI></P>
<P>When the next <HI>Market-day</HI> came; we were
<PB N="9" REF="22"/>
driven like Beasts thither, and exposed to <HI>Sale;</HI>
and there is a great deal of God's goodness in
that <HI>one word,</HI> that it was not to the <HI>Slaughter-house
to be Butcher'd,</HI> as well as to the <HI>Market to
be Sold.</HI> Their Cruelty is great, but their
<HI>Covetousness</HI> exceeds their <HI>Cruelty;</HI> could they
make as much of us Dead, as they make alive,
that so both the Interests of <HI>Cruelty,</HI> and of <HI>Co∣vetousness,</HI>
might be secured, and reconciled,
we were well assured which way it should have
gone with us. But it must be a great deal of
<HI>Tallow</HI> and <HI>Fat,</HI> that will answer two or three
<HI>Dollers</HI> a <HI>Month.</HI></P>
<P>Their manner of selling <HI>Slaves,</HI> is this. They
lead them up and down the <HI>Fair,</HI> or <HI>Market;</HI>
and when a Chapman bids any Money, they
presently cry, <HI>a-Rache! a-Rache!</HI> that is,
<HI>Here's so much Money bidden, who bids more?</HI>
They that cheapen the exposed <HI>Slaves</HI> are ve∣ry
<HI>circumspect persons, they carry their Eyes in
their Heads, as well as their Money in their Purses,</HI>
and use the one in laying out the other; for
they <HI>are loath to buy a Pig in a Poke;</HI> their first
Policy is to <HI>look in their Mouths;</HI> and a good,
strong, entire set of <HI>Grinders</HI> will advance the
Price considerably, and they have good Rea∣son
for this Practice: for first, <HI>they are Rational
Creatures,</HI> and know, <HI>that they who have not
Teeth, cannot eat, cannot work;</HI> and they <HI>that
cannot work, are not for their turn; and they
that are not for their turn, are not for their
<PB N="10" REF="23"/>
Money.</HI> And Secondly, they intend to keep
them at hard meat all the Year, and it must
not be <HI>Gums,</HI> but solid <HI>Teeth</HI> (nay, if it were
<HI>possible, case-hardn'd Teeth)</HI> that <HI>must chew it;</HI>
and when all is done, they had need of the
<HI>Ostriches Stomach to digest it.</HI> Their next pro∣cess
<HI>is to feel their Limbs;</HI> as whether there be
any <HI>Fracture,</HI> or <HI>Dislocation</HI> in the <HI>Bones;</HI> any
thing <HI>Analogical</HI> to <HI>Spavin,</HI> or <HI>Ring-bone,</HI> for
these will bring down the <HI>Makret</HI> wonderfully;
And to be <HI>clean Limb'd, close coupled, well
joynted, will advance it as much. The Age is ve∣ry
considerable;</HI> but they that <HI>sell them,</HI> did not
<HI>breed them,</HI> and therefore they know nothing,
more or less of that: Two waies they have to
find out the Age; the one is, to stand to the
courtesie of the <HI>Slaves,</HI> but they are not bound
to make any such Discovery, and therefore
they go by general conjectures from the <HI>Beard,
Face,</HI> or <HI>Hair;</HI> but a good set of <HI>Teeth</HI> will
make any one <HI>Ten Years Younger,</HI> and a broken
one <HI>Ten Years Older than the Truth;</HI> for if they
were <HI>Five Hundred Years Old all is a Case,</HI> if they
could but eat and work; or if they could not
eat, yet if they could but work, or if they nei∣ther
eat nor work, if their Skins would but fetch
in the Mony again. You shall have the <HI>Seller</HI>
commend his Goods to the Sky, and the <HI>Buyer</HI>
on the other hand, as much undervalue them,
and the true <HI>Market-price</HI> commonly lies just
<HI>between them; but so it is all the World over.</HI> Or
<PB N="11" REF="23" MS="y"/>
saies the <HI>Seller,</HI> mark what a <HI>Back he has,</HI> what a
breadth he bears between the <HI>Shoulders!</HI> What
<HI>a Chest!</HI> How <HI>strong set!</HI> How <HI>fitted on the nonce
for Burdens! He'l do but e'ne to much work.</HI>
Pish, saies the <HI>Buyer,</HI> He looks like a <HI>Pillard,</HI>
like a very <HI>Meacock</HI> at his <HI>Provinder,</HI> and one
that seems to be surfeited. But they are very
curious in examining the Hands; for if they
be callous and brawny, they will shrewdly
guess they have been inured to Labour; if de∣licate
and tender, they will suspect some <HI>Gen∣tleman,</HI>
or <HI>Merchant,</HI> and then the hopes of a
<HI>good Price of Redemption</HI> makes him Saleable.</P>
<P>When any are sold, they must be trotted
once more to the <HI>Vice-Roys,</HI> that he may have
the review of them, and if he likes any of them
at the prizes they went off at, there's no more
Dispute, <HI>they are his own.</HI></P>
<P>As for my self, I was sold the first <HI>Marget-day</HI>
to a <HI>Tagareen;</HI> and that the <HI>Reader</HI> may
not stumble at that hard word, he may un∣derstand;
That when the <HI>Moors</HI> were driven
out of <HI>Spain</HI> by <HI>Ferdinand the Great,</HI> they, up∣on
their return into <HI>Africa,</HI> assumed Names
that might argue <HI>Gentility,</HI> and be an Evidence
of their <HI>Ancient Extract,</HI> from such places
where they had been great <HI>Dons,</HI> and accord∣ingly
there are many Families thus denomina∣ted;
as <HI>Tagareens, Jarbeens,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>THose Miseries which it is dreadful to en∣dure,

<P>The first Adventure I met with after I was
brought to my <HI>Patron</HI>'s House (for so I must

My <HI>Patron</HI>'s Father being desirous to see his
Sons <HI>Penny-worth,</HI> commanded me up into a
<HI>Gallery,</HI> which looked into the Court; he be∣gan
to insult over me with insupportable scorn,
reflecting upon me because I was a <HI>Christian,</HI>
and cast out some Expressions which did really
reflect upon the Person of my <HI>Rdeemer,</HI> though
I have heard worse since.) My Neck was not
yet bowed, nor my Heart broken to the Yoke
of Bondage; I could not well brook, because
I had not ben used then to such Language; and
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
because I could not express my self in the <HI>Mo∣resco,</HI>

waies as well as I could, <HI>That their Prophet was
but a Cobler.</HI> I confess, my meaning was no
more, but that <HI>Mahomet,</HI> by the help of <HI>Sergius,</HI>
a <HI>Nestorian Monk,</HI> and <HI>Abdalla</HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> had
patch'd up a Cento of <HI>Jewish,</HI> and <HI>Monkish Fop∣peries,</HI>
which was now their <HI>Religion.</HI> But he,
without the preamble of many Railing words,
fell upon me with severe blows; whatever <HI>Rage</HI>
and <HI>Fury</HI> his <HI>Hands</HI> or <HI>Feet</HI> could <HI>Execute,</HI> that
I felt; and my intreaties did but enrage his
<HI>Choler,</HI> so that I saw I might sooner blow out
the Fire with a pair of Bellows, than lenifie his
passion with Prayers; I had no other way but
this, to make an offer of leaping down out of
the <HI>Gallery</HI> into the <HI>Court,</HI> and therefore clap∣ping
my hands upon the <HI>Rails,</HI> as if I would
throw my self head-long down over them, and
rather chuse to receive my Death from the
<HI>Pavement,</HI> than his <HI>Hands,</HI> he presently asswa∣ges,
if not his <HI>Rage,</HI> yet the <HI>Execution</HI> of it.
The Old Gentleman knew very well, that if I
lost my Life, his Son must lose his present Mo∣ney,
and future profit; <HI>for there's little made
out of a Dead Man's Skin:</HI> and therefore he re∣spites
my further punishment till my <HI>Patron</HI>'s
Return, and then indeed this reputed Blasphe∣my
of mine with full cry was carried to his
Ears, <HI>and it lost nothing in the telling,</HI> but was
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>
aggravated to purpose: My <HI>Patron</HI> being Na∣turally
a very passionate Man, said nothing,
but without Examination, drew out his long
Knife, (which they constantly wear by their
sides) and made at me; and had there doubt∣less
put an end to my Life and Captivity at
once, had not his Wife, who was there seaso∣nably
present, taken him in her Arms, and
sweeten'd him into more moderate Counsels.
Some will be ready enough to say, that I was
but a <HI>Martyr to my own Folly:</HI> This was not
a place for Dispute, but Obedience. Well, I
learnt from hence two Lessons: One, <HI>That
when the Body is a Slave, the Reason must not ex∣pect
to be free; and where the whole outward Man
is in Bondage, the Tongue must not plead Exem∣ption.</HI>
A Second, That it's fair for Slaves to
enjoy <HI>the freedom of their own Consciences, with∣out
Reviling anothers Religion,</HI> though errone∣ous;
<HI>and this Wit I bought,</HI> as it fell out, <HI>a pret∣ty
good Penny-worth.</HI></P>
<P>When the Storm was over, my employ∣ment
was assigned me (for they had rather see
a Slave Dead than Idle) and for about half a
Year it lay in trudging on Errands, bearing
Burdens, and discharging other Domestick
Services at Command, wherein the only con∣sideration
was, <HI>That it was Commanded,</HI> and not
<HI>What was Commanded.</HI></P>
<P>At this time my <HI>Patron</HI> had a part in a <HI>Man
of War,</HI> which carried Twelve Guns: She be∣ing
<PB N="15" REF="25" MS="y"/>
at Sea, (with some others of the same place)
met with an <HI>English</HI> Merchant, <HI>Laden with
Plate,</HI> and other Rich Commodities from <HI>Spain,</HI>
and Bound for <HI>London,</HI> (one <HI>Isaac</HI> being <HI>Ma∣ster)</HI>
and after a very sharp, though short Dis∣pute,
the <HI>Algerines</HI> carried her, and brought
her safe home. The Adventurers divide their
Booty, and being high flown with this success,
they Resolve to fit her out again to carry more
Guns; and from hence grew my new employ∣ment.
Upon the <HI>Capenters</HI> I attended, wait∣ed
on the <HI>Smiths,</HI> to get the Iron-work fitted,
and finished; and truly he allowed me more
for Portage than to the ordinary <HI>Hammels,</HI> or
common <HI>Porters.</HI></P>
<P>When this Ship was now fitted for another
Adventure, my <HI>Patron</HI> tells me, <HI>I must go in
her;</HI> it was a nipping word: I pleaded, that I
was no <HI>Sea-man,</HI> understood nothing of the
<HI>Mariners</HI> Art, and therefore as he could ex∣pect
little Service from me in that kind, so I
must expect most rigorous treatment, because
I could not acquit my self in the Service as well
as others; he removed my Pleas, and promi∣sed
I should not be wronged; but there was
more at the bottom than all this: For here
a Case of Conscience offered it self, <HI>Whether I
might without Sin in any Case fight against Chri∣stians,
on the Port of the common Enemy of all
Christianity?</HI> The best Resolution I could give
my self, was this; That first, my employ∣my
<PB N="16" REF="26" MS="y"/>
employment would only lie in managing
the Tackle, which will kill no Body; but it
was replied, <HI>That without the due management
of the Tackle, all the Guns in the Ship would
kill no Body:</HI> Secondly, therefore I answered,
That it was not evident that they would en∣gage
against <HI>Christians</HI> more than all the rest
of Mankind, for all the World are their Ene∣mies,
who are Rich enough to invite them,
and too weak to resist them; but my <HI>Patron</HI>
had a Solution worth all these: He told me
peremptorily, <HI>I must, and should go;</HI> I found
my self under force, I was a Prest Man: who
could not examine the Justice of the Cause. In
a word, his Commands were back'd with Com∣pulsion,
and whatever his Authority was, he
had more Power, than I had Courage to de∣ny,
or Strength to resist; and go I did. Yet
this I will say for him, he spoke to the Captain
and Officers of the Ship, to treat me civilly,
that is, less cruelly than other Slaves were treat∣ed:
He gave me some Money also in my
Pocket, bought me Clothes, and laid me in
Provision above the Ships allowance.</P>
<P>Nine Weeks we were at Sea, within, and
without the <HI>Streights,</HI> Cruising, and Picka∣rooning
up and down, at last we met with
one poor <HI>Hungarian French Man of War,</HI>
whom we took, and so returned.</P>
<P>My <HI>Patron</HI> having been at great charges in
fitting, and manning out this Ship, and the
<PB N="17" REF="26" MS="y"/>
Reprisals so slenderly answering his great cost,
and greater hopes, told me, I must allow him
two <HI>Dollers per Month,</HI> and Live ashore where
I would, and get it were I could. This was a
hard Chapter, That he that could not main∣tain
himself, should be compelled to contribute
to the maintenance of another; it was difficult
to raise encrease out of no stock, and to pay
Interest out of no Principal; but there was no
contending; It cost me much debate with my
self, and I turn'd my thoughts into all forms
and shapes, but all Projects that presented them∣selves
were incumbred with so many difficul∣ties,
that they amounted very near to impossi∣bilities.
The more I consulted, the further I
found my self from a conclusion, and I could
see no way but one, (but that was worth a
Thousand, could I have made the best of it,)
and that was to commit my self to God, who
had brought me into this strait, beseeching
him that he would bring me out of it.</P>
<P>But that my trusting to God might not be
a Cloak for Laziness, or a Pillow for Sloath to
rest upon, I addrest my self to an <HI>English-man,</HI>
whose condition was that of a Slave, whose
Calling was that of a <HI>Taylor.</HI> He at first word
counselled me to come and stay with him, and
he would teach me to work of his Trade. I ac∣counted
nothing base that was honest, and ne∣cessity
would ennoble a far meaner Emploi∣ment,
and very readily closed in my thoughts
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
with his motion, and was suddenly elevated
into huge hopes that I should now be in a ca∣pacity
to answer my <HI>Patron</HI>'s demands, and es∣cape
his lash. But my straits were not (it seems)
great enough to glorifie God; nor my condi∣tion
mean enough to magnifie his Power in
raising me; I was not reduced to that Extre∣mety
which would make an oportunity to ex∣alt
his appearing Mercy; for when I came to
him the next <HI>Day,</HI> I perceived by his silence
that his mind was changed, and I was loth,
either out of Modesty or Pride, to give him
further trouble; and therefore interpreting his
silence to be a more civil way of denial, I left
him, and once more Launched out into the
wide World.</P>
<P>In this forlorn posture I wandred, but nei∣ther
knew, nor much cared whither, though
the wise God both knew, and cared; and his
Providence directed me to another <HI>English-man,</HI>
who was sitting in a little Shop: He ask∣ed
me what News? And (as that which is up∣permost
alwaies comes out first) I presently be∣gan
the Story of my desperate Condition;
how the Rigid Law of my <HI>Patron</HI> had imposed
two <HI>Dollers per Month</HI> upon me, and I knew
not where to levy the least Mite of it: He
heard, considered, pityed my Condition, and
invited me to come and sit in the Shop with
him; but seeing nothing but the bare Walls,
I asked him, to what end? What Trade should
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
we drive there? There's not much difference
between starving in the Streets, and in the Shop.
Country-man (said he) I drive here an unknown
Trade; here I sell Lead, Iron, Shot, Strong-wa∣ters,
Tobacco, and many other things. This
motion was a great deal to good to be refuesd,
and I think at that time no tolerable condition
would have stck with me.</P>
<P>I acquainted my <HI>Patron</HI> with my Design,
pleaded I wanted stock to set up with; he lent
me a <HI>small modicum,</HI> and with another pittance
that I had privately reserved of my own, I be∣gan
to Trade. That very Night I went and
bought a parcel of Tobacco, the next Morning
we dress'd it, cut it, and fitted it for Sale; and
the World seemed to smile on us wonderfully.
In this way of Partner-ship we continued for
some while, and what we got clear, we divided
every week according to the proportion of our
respective stocks. In a while, finding the
World to come in upon us, we ventured up∣on
no less then a whole Butt of Wine, some
Money we had, and some Credit: This Wine
we drew out, and got considerably by it. But
it's very difficult to maintain moderation in an
exalted State, for even our State was capable
of better and worse; for my Partner being ele∣vated
with our good success, grew a good Fel∣low,
and a bad Husband; neglecting his busi∣ness,
went tipling, and fndling up and down,
and the Concerns of the Shop and Trade lay
wholly upon my Shoulders.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="28"/>
It fell out, that one <HI>John Randal,</HI> who with
his Wife and Child were taken in the same
Ship with my self, being put to the same shifts
with my self, and, as 'tis very common, ha∣ving
a Monthly Tax imposed upon him by
his Patron, which he must scrape out where
he could, and besides maintain himself, his
Wife, and Child, went up and down seeking
for Relief, at last the poor Man straggled to
our Shop: His Case made great impression up∣on
me, I could not but consider the goodness
of God to me, that should now be in a condi∣tion
to advise, and help another, who so lately
wanted both my self; and it had this operati∣on
upon me, that I would not suffer a poor di∣stressed
Country-man, a Fellow-Captive, a Fel∣low-Christian
to stand begging at that door,
where I had so lately stood my self: Shall I
shut the Door, or my Heart upon him, when
God hath opened a Door of hope to me in the
day of my Trouble? Shall I so ill requite the
Lord's kindness to me? Surely that God who
<HI>comforts us in our Tribulations,</HI> expects that we
should comfort others in theirs, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 4. I
bad him therefore come in, and knowing him
to be a <HI>Glover</HI> by Trade, advised him to learn
to make Canvas Cloaths for Sea-men that are
Slaves; and for my own part, he should sit
<HI>Rent-free;</HI> but if my Partner would insist up∣on
his Moiety, he must be willing to satisfie
him, for I had no power to determine of ano∣ther's
Right.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="28"/>
It were tedious to trouble the <HI>Reader</HI> how I
wore out three or four irksome Years in this
way of Trading. All this while there was no
dawning of deliverance from our Bondage:
As one Year left us, another found us, and de∣livered
us over Captives to the next: Our
condition was bad, and in danger every day
of being worse, as the mutable Humours of
our Patrons determin'd upon us, for our Shop
and Trade was no free-hold: The Truth is,
in time we were so habituated to Bondage, that
we almost forgot Liberty, and grew stupid, and
sensless of our Slavery; like <HI>Issachar,</HI> we <HI>couch∣ed
down between our burdens, we bowed our Shoul∣ders
to bear, and became Servants to Tribute,</HI>
Gen. 49. 14, 15. And were in danger to be
like those <HI>Israelites</HI> in <HI>Babylon,</HI> who being once
settled, forgot <HI>Canaan, and dwelt with the King
for his work,</HI> 1 Chron. 4. 23. We seem'd as if
our Ears had been bored, and we had vowed
to serve our Patrons for ever. Long Bondage
breaks the Spirits, it scatters hope off, and dis∣courages
all attempts for freedom: And there
were more evils attended our condition than
the bodily torture, which we were alwaies li∣able
to, and sometimes endured.</P>
<P>1. We were under a perpetual temptation
to deny the Lord that bought us, to make our
Souls Slaves, that our Bodies might recover
Liberty. As <HI>Satan</HI> once tempted <HI>Job</HI> to <HI>Curse
God, and Dye;</HI> so he knew how to change his
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
Note to us, and accommodate his Snare to our
condition, to <HI>Curse God, that we might Live.</HI>
How many have made Ship-wrack of Faith,
that they might not be Chained to the <HI>Gal∣liees?</HI>
I can never enough admire the grace of
that Promise, <HI>Psal. 1253. The Rod of the wicked
shal not always rost upon the lot of the Righteous, lest
the Righteous put forth their hands to Iniquity;</HI> nor
ever enough adore the faithfulness of him,
<HI>who will not suffer us to be tempted above that we
are able,</HI> 1 Cor. 10. 13.</P>
<P>And 2. Evil is the unmaning, and dispirit∣ing
of the Soul to worthy Actions; for we are
apt to put on the Temper and Spirit of Slaves
with the Habit, and the Christians of the <HI>Greek</HI>
Communion, are a very sad instance of this
Truth.</P>
<P>And 3. We were very much at a loss for
the Preaching of the World: And yet herein
the Gracious God stept in for our Relief.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How God Provided for our Souls, by sen∣ding
us an Able Minister to Preach the
Gospel to us in our Bondage.</HEAD>
<P>THE gracious God looking upon the affli∣ction
of his poor Servants, and <HI>Remembring
us in our low Estate,</HI> was pleased many waies to
mitigate the load of our Captivity: We have
Reason to say, with the Church, <HI>Ezra 9. 9. We
were Bondsmen, yet our God hath not forsaken us
in our Bondage, but hath extended Mercy to us,
to give us a reviving, and a Nail in his Holy
place:</HI> And thus he brought about his Design
of Grace and Mercy. There was an <HI>English</HI>
Ship taken by some of our <HI>Algerine</HI> Pirates, and
in her one Mr. <HI>Devereux Sprat,</HI> a Minister of
the Gospel. It deserves our consideration, and
greatest Admiration, that the wise God should
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upply our Necessities</HI> at the cost and charges of
others of his dear Servants: But thus Provi∣dence
sent <HI>Joseph</HI> into <HI>Egypt,</HI> where he endured
thirteen Years Slavery, that he might <HI>preserve
the Lives</HI> of his Fathers Family, within those
narrow walls the most visible Church of God
in those daies was enclosed, <HI>Gen. 45. 5.</HI> Now,
some of us observing this Mr. <HI>Sprat</HI> to be a Per∣son
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
of very Sober, Grave, and Religious De∣portment,
we addressed our selves to him, and
humbly entreated him that we might enjoy the
benefit of his Ministry; in Order whereto, we
desired him that he would compound with his
Patron at so much a month as he could, and be∣cause
we were abundantly convinc'd of our Du∣ty
to administer to him of our <HI>Carnal things,</HI>
who should administer to us of <HI>his Spirituals,</HI> we
engaged to allow him <HI>a Competency</HI> to maintain
himself, and satisfie the expectations of his Pa∣tron:
The good man hearkned to us with much
readiness; and now indeed we found our burd∣ens
much lighter, and our conditions not prest
so hard upon our Spirrits: <HI>Thrice a week</HI> this
Godly, painul Servant of Jesus Christ prayed
with us, and Preach'd to us the Word of God;
our meeting-place was a Cellar, which I had
hired at some distance from our Shop, where I
stowed some Goods that were peculiarly my
own when we fell into a greater stroke of trade.
To our Meetings resorted many, sometimes
three or fourscore, and though we met <HI>next the
Street,</HI> yet we never had the least disturbance
from the <HI>Turks,</HI> or <HI>Moors;</HI> for whilst we in∣termeddled
not with <HI>their Superstitions,</HI> but paid
our Patrons <HI>their demands,</HI> we might, without
any disturbance from them, <HI>Worship our God,
according to our Consciences:</HI> It's true, that such
were the circumstances of the Slavery of many
poor Christians, that they <HI>could not</HI> attend; and
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
such the wretched carelessness of others, that
they <HI>would not</HI> attend, and such the Provisions
that God had made for others, by other means,
that they <HI>needed not,</HI> perhaps, attend upon
God's Worship with us; but thus was our God
pleased to give us the means of <HI>strengthning our
Faith,</HI> and <HI>Comforting our drooping Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>At length came one Captain <HI>Wildy</HI> of <HI>Rat∣cliff</HI>
to Trade there, who, with the Assistance
of the <HI>Legorn</HI> Mercahnts, free'd our Minister
from his Patron. After his freedom from his
Patron, yet there remained <HI>a Duty of sixty Dol∣lers,</HI>
which was a particular charge payable to
the Publick Treasury, before he could be fully
enlarged from the City: We Petitioned there∣fore
the Captain, that <HI>he might,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sprat</HI>
himself, that <HI>he would</HI> still continue to be Ser∣viceable
to our poor Souls, in the work of the
Gospel, and we easily prevailed, and had the
benefit of his Ministry whilst I staid there.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some Remarkable Observations that I
gleaned up, whilst I remained in Al∣gires.</HEAD>
<P>THey that are pressed with <HI>their own Perso∣nal
Grievances,</HI> have little leisure <HI>to look
abroad,</HI> and observe <HI>the Motions of others;</HI> and
indeed our own Afflictions however sweetned,
lay still gnawing, and grating upon our Spirits
that we must needs be very ill qualified to trea∣sure
up materials to make a History. Such a
Design required Leisure, Liberty, Privacy,
Retiredness, Intelligence, and strict Correspon∣dence,
to all which we were perfect Strangers.
Yet sometimes I could make a truce with my
Troubles, and obtain so long a cessation from
my vexatious Pressures, as to make Obser∣vation.</P>
<P>And. 1. <HI>The Hypocrisie of their Profession</HI>
was so notorious, that he must put out his Eyes
that did not see it. One Month in the year they
Observe their <HI>Ramedam,</HI> which is <HI>their Lent;</HI>
and indeed rhey Observe it <HI>by day</HI> with more
<HI>Monkish Austerity,</HI> imposing upon themselves <HI>a
total Abstinence:</HI> An Observation which they
may be presumed to owe to that <HI>Nestorian
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
Monk,</HI> who clubb'd <HI>with Mahomet</HI> in the cur∣sed
invention of <HI>the Alchoran:</HI> But for all their
demure <HI>Quadragesimal looks by day,</HI> they <HI>give</HI>
or <HI>sell themselves</HI> to commit <HI>with greediness</HI> all
manner of the most execrable Villanies <HI>by night.</HI>
And they cheat themselves with this evasion;
that forsooth <HI>Mahomet Commanded them to Fast
so many Days, but not so many Nights;</HI> For
now they beat up their Drums, and call their
Friends first <HI>out of bed,</HI> then out of Doors, they
provoke, challenge, dare one another to <HI>eat,
drink, and run into all excess of Riot.</HI> They
will neither <HI>spare Men in their Rage, nor Wo∣men
in their Lust:</HI> The <HI>two hungry meals of
the Day, makes the third of the Night an errand
Glutton.</HI> By Day they create themselves <HI>a
Purgatory,</HI> and by night the poor Slaves <HI>find a
Hell.</HI> Now when they have cramm'd their
Guts <HI>all Night,</HI> and are <HI>Maw-sick in the mor∣ning,</HI>
they put on their <HI>Lenten face again;</HI> and
call that <HI>a Fast,</HI> which is <HI>but Physick;</HI> and pre∣tend
<HI>Religion</HI> for that which they are compell'd
to <HI>by Nature;</HI> that is, <HI>they Fast when they can
eat and drink no longer:</HI> But indeed their Fast
by Day is nothing but <HI>a dry Drunkenness;</HI> for
when they have drunk, and whored themselves
<HI>into sin,</HI> they fancy they <HI>merit a pardon by Ab∣stinence.</HI>
A piece of Hypocrisie so gross, that
whether it be to be sampled any where in the
World, unless, perhaps, by the <HI>Popish Carne∣vals,</HI>
I cannot tell.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="32"/>
2. I could not but observe, that though they
allow, <HI>that every man may be saved in that Re∣ligion
he professes, provided he walks by i'ts
Rules,;</HI> and therefore that at last, <HI>the Jews,</HI> un∣der
the Banner of <HI>Moses;</HI> the <HI>Christians,</HI> un∣der
the Banner of <HI>Christ;</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> under
the Banner of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> shall all march over
<HI>a fair bridg,</HI> into I know not what <HI>Paradise,</HI> a
place far beyond <HI>the Elisian Fields;</HI> yet they
afford <HI>no mercy</HI> to one, who having <HI>once profes∣sed,</HI>
afterwards <HI>Revolts from Mahumetanism;</HI>
an Instance whereof I shall now present the Rea∣der
with.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> every year return a considera∣ble
sum of mony to <HI>Algires,</HI> to be employed
in the Redemption of such of their own Coun∣trey
as are there in Slavery: Some say, there
is <HI>a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>articular Treasury</HI> set apart for that Ser∣vice;
but this I know, that they use <HI>the Cha∣ritable
benevolence of well disposed Persons,</HI> to
advance it. Now, there was a <HI>Spanish</HI> Friar,
that was a Slave, who being passed by <HI>in the
Redemption that Year,</HI> took it <HI>very hainously</HI> to
be neglected, thought himself <HI>much wronged;</HI>
hereupon he grows <HI>Discontented,</HI> and the De∣vil
(who never works with greater success than
upon that Humor) takes the Advantage to <HI>push
him on;</HI> and he <HI>in a pett,</HI> Renounces the Chri∣stian
Religion, declares himself <HI>a Mussulman,</HI>
and accordingly appears in his <HI>Turkish</HI> Habit.
I knew him very well by sight he was a fat,
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
corpulent person; but after he had turned <HI>Rene∣gado,</HI>
I observed him to become <HI>strangely lean,
and dejected in his Countenance.</HI> but I little sus∣pected,
that the <HI>Root of his Distemper</HI> lay in <HI>his
Conscience:</HI> but it seems he had severely reflected
upon <HI>his Apostacy,</HI> for he had not Renounced
<HI>onely his Popery,</HI> but <HI>his Christianity:</HI> His own
Conscience, which was <HI>a Thousand Witnesses</HI>
against him, was <HI>a Thousand Tormentors</HI> to him:
Long he bore <HI>i'ts secret and stinging lashes,</HI> but
when he could no longer stand under them,
he goes to the Vice-Roy's Palace, and there
openly declares himself a Christian, and pro∣tests
against the Superstition and Idolatry of <HI>Ma∣homet,</HI>
as a most Execrable, and damnable Im∣posture:
Immediatly he is conveyed before the
Councel, and there strictly Examined, he per∣sists
resolutely in his Profession, whereupon he
is clapt in Irons, and for some time there secu∣red:
Now, they pretended this reason for their
proceedure. That there had been some pra∣ctising
and tampering with him, either <HI>Morally
by Argument,</HI> or <HI>Naturally by some Dose of in∣toxicating
Drugs,</HI> that had thus distempered
him; for loth they were it should be thought,
that any Man <HI>of sound mind, or master of his
Reason,</HI> would ever revolt from their Religi∣on:
But when they saw him fixt in his Reso∣lution,
and that neither what <HI>he felt,</HI> or <HI>might
fear,</HI> what they had <HI>inflicted,</HI> or could <HI>threaten,</HI>
did unhinge him from his Profession, they pro∣ceeded
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
to the last remedy, and inexorably <HI>Con∣demned
him to the Fire:</HI> A way of Punishment
which <HI>they learnt from the</HI> Spaniards <HI>themselves
who first set up the Inquisition against the</HI> Moors,
<HI>and have now turned the edg of it against the
Protestants.</HI> And now they proceed to the Ex∣ecution
of the Sentence, which was performed
with some <HI>Pomp, and State.</HI> And first, they
formed <HI>a Crown with a Cross upon the top of it,</HI>
within the Plates, and Bars whereof they put
Flax; thus Crowned, they guard him through
the City, out of the West-Gate, about half a
mile, which was the appointed place of Execu∣tion:
and first, one puts Fire to the Flax in his
<HI>mock-Crown,</HI> to take possession of <HI>his Head,</HI> in
<HI>the Name of the rest of his Body:</HI> at first he
shook it off, but another put Fire again to it with
a Cane, and then the poor man stood patiently,
and presently they put Fire to the whole Pile,
and there burnt him: I saw some of his Bones,
and scorched Flesh after he was dead; and the
same Evening came a Zealous <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and
carried away some of his scorched Flesh, and
Bones, as <HI>the Holy Reliques of a Martyr,</HI> saying
<HI>I have now done enough to make satisfaction for
all the sins that I have committed.</HI></P>
<P>3. It's worth Admiration, to see in what
<HI>great awe</HI> they stand of <HI>the meanest Officer,</HI> who
is known to be such by his <HI>Turbant, and Ha∣bit.</HI>
If any Affray be made, or a murder com∣mitted
in the Streets, the <HI>Chiaux,</HI> or Officer
<PB N="31" REF="33" MS="y"/>
presently comes without any Weapon or Per∣son
to assist him; and if he seizes the Offenders,
none is so hardy as to resist <HI>even unarmed Au∣thority.</HI></P>
<P>4. The great Reverence which <HI>the Moors</HI>
pay to <HI>the Turks,</HI> though both <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> is
remarkable: If a <HI>Moor</HI> shall dare <HI>to strike a
Turk,</HI> he is punisht with great severity: I saw
two <HI>Moors</HI> whilst I was there, whose <HI>right
Hands were chopt</HI> off for this one Crime, and
hung about their necks in strings; the one was
set upon an Asse, the other walkt by on foot,
the Common Cryer proclaiming before them
their Offence, through the chief Streets of the
City. I saw another also with his heels tyed to
a Horses Tayl; he was wholly naked, onely he
had on a pair of linnen Drawers, and thus was
he dragg'd through the Streets? It was a most
lamentable Spectacle, to see his Body all torn
with the rugged way, and stones; the skin torn
off his Back and Elbows, his Head broken, and
all covered with blood, and dirt, and thus was
he dragg'd through the City out at <HI>Bubazoon,</HI>
or the East-gate, where he ended his miserable
Life.</P>
<P>Two others of their own Country-men I saw
Executed in a most terrible, and dreadful man∣ner,
(but either I did not know, or do not re∣member
their Crimes:) The one was thrown off
from <HI>a high Wall,</HI> and in his fall he was caught
by the way, by one of <HI>the great</HI> sharp <HI>Hooks,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="34" MS="y"/>
which were fastned in the Wall; It caught him
<HI>just under the Ribs,</HI> and there he hung <HI>roaring
in unspeakable pain</HI> till he dyed. The other was
<HI>fastned to a Ladder,</HI> his <HI>wrists, and ankles</HI> be∣ing
nailed through with <HI>Iron spikes,</HI> in such a
posture as somewhat resembles <HI>the Celebrated
Cross of St. Andrew;</HI> and least his Flesh and
Sinews should fail, and the Nails not hold; his
<HI>Wrists</HI> and <HI>Ankles</HI> were bound fast with small
Cords to the Ladder: <HI>Two days I saw him alive
under this Torture,</HI> how much longer he lived
under it I cannot tell.</P>
<P>5. They are generally great Enemies to De∣bauchery
in publick: It's a great scandal to them
when they see any <HI>Christians, who brought that
Beastiality out of their own Countries with them,</HI>
to be guilty of it. I have heard them say, of a
Drunken Slave; <HI>A Christian?</HI> No, <HI>He's a
Swine.</HI> And though they will indulge them∣selves
by Night (especially in their <HI>Ramedam</HI>
Month) yet woe be to him, that shall Offend
<HI>by Day in that Kind.</HI> There was an <HI>English∣man,</HI>
who had brought <HI>over with him his drunk∣en
Humour,</HI> and his Captivity <HI>had not made him
Sober:</HI> and when <HI>Religion has not firm hold of the
Heart,</HI> a little matter will make such a one <HI>let
go his hold of Religion:</HI> This <HI>English-man</HI> turn'd
a Renegado, and of <HI>a Drunken Christian became
a Drunken Turk,</HI> and was not able <HI>to keep the
Pot from his Head,</HI> during <HI>their Holy time of
Ramedam;</HI> being one day found thus like a
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
Sot, he was brought into <HI>the Cassabal,</HI> or Chief
Court of Judicature, where he was adjudged to
receive many hundreds of violent blows; some
<HI>upon his naked Back and Reins,</HI> others upon <HI>his
naked Belly;</HI> he could <HI>not creep</HI> from the place
of punishment, but was <HI>carried away</HI> by <HI>the
Hammels;</HI> his <HI>Belly, and Back</HI> were so excori∣ated,
that <HI>Sampson Baker,</HI> an <HI>English-man,</HI>
who was his Chirurgeon, assured me he was
forced to cut off abundance of his Flesh before
he could be Cured.</P>
<P>6. What Cruelties they Exercise <HI>upon poor
Slaves,</HI> needs not be mentioned, and there will
be an Occasion to speak of <HI>the most Ordinary
way</HI> of punishment e're long. Let it suffice, that
all is <HI>Arbitrary, and unlimitted.</HI> If a Patron
shall <HI>kill his Slave,</HI> for ought I could perceive,
he suffers no more for it, than if he should <HI>kill
his Horse:</HI> There was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Youth, a Slave
to a <HI>Turk,</HI> who, upon some provocation, <HI>drew
his Knife at his Patron;</HI> for this <HI>Offer,</HI> he was
Sentenced to be dragg'd out at one of the Gates,
and there to have his <HI>Arms and Legs broken in
pieces with the great Sledg Hammer,</HI> which Sen∣tence
was accordingly Executed, for though I
could not see <HI>his face for the Crowd,</HI> yet <HI>I heard
the blows,</HI> and the miserable Cries of the poor
dying Young Man.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The grievous Punishment Inflicted upon
John Randal; the Authors Danger, and
Deliverance from the same, upon pre∣tence
that they had attempted to make
an Escape.</HEAD>
<P>IT is time to re-assume my own concerns, and
look a little into my own Condition, which,
through the good providence of God, was much
better than that of many of my poor Brethren
and Fellow-Captives; and yet I met with great
ebbings and flowings in my Tranquility: whilst
I was managing my Trade very stoutly and suc∣cessfully,
<HI>(John Randal</HI> working with me in my
Shop) my Partner now having knockt off, and
left all to me: One day I changed a twenty shil∣ling-piece
of Gold for Silver with a Friend, and
having the mony chinking in my hand, <HI>John
Randal</HI> asked me, what I did with so much mo∣ny?
I desired him to keep it for me, till our re∣turn,
and he should know: For he being not
very well, we agreed to walk out of the Town
to take the fresh Air; a liberty, which for some∣what
above a mile, is indulged to the Slaves:
When we had walked almost to <HI>the end of our
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
Tedder,</HI> I was desirous to walk <HI>a little further</HI>
to view the Coasts, if, perhaps, any advantage
might offer it self afterwards for an Escape,
though we <HI>Actually designed no such thing.</HI> As
we were prying about the Sea-side, one of the
Spies appointed constantly to watch, lest any of
the Slaves should run away, came to us, and
charged us <HI>with an attempt to make an Escape?</HI>
we flatly denied it, but he laid hold on us; there
was no resisting; Obey we must, and accor∣dingly
attended his Mastership towards the Ci∣ty:
As we drew near, I espyed some <HI>English-men</HI>
at Quoits (for with such <HI>Recreations</HI> and <HI>Diver∣sions,</HI>
they are willing now and then <HI>to beguile
the tedious minutes</HI> of lingring thraldom) I beck∣oned
to one of them whom I knew, and preten∣ding
only to whisper to him, I secretly convey∣ed
to him my purse, wherein were <HI>seven pieces
of eight?</HI> we were presently met by <HI>another Spy,</HI>
and those two led us to <HI>a little blind House,</HI>
where they search'd us, they took away the
<HI>twenty shillings,</HI> which I had put into my Friends
hand, and finding nothing upon me, <HI>took away
my Doublet,</HI> and then brought us before the
Vice-roy, and his Council: We were straight∣ly
Examined, and strongly charged with an at∣tempt
to Escape: We peremptorily <HI>denyed all,</HI>
and stood upon <HI>our Innocency,</HI> affirming, that
our onely design of walking abroad, <HI>was to take
the fresh Air,</HI> occasioned by my Fellows Sick∣ness.
This Purgation would not be Accepted,

and the <HI>Battoon</HI> was commanded to be brought
forth, we answered, we durst not falsely accuse
our selves, nor make our selves Criminal, when
we were not so, and therefore if such was <HI>their
will and pleasure,</HI> we must abide by it, and so
<HI>we sat down by the sticks.</HI></P>
<P>The way of Punishment by the Battoon, or
Cudgel, as this, <HI>They have a</HI> strong staff, about
six Foot long, <HI>in the middle whereof are bored</HI>
two holes; <HI>Into these Holes</HI> a Cord is put, and
the ends of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd fastned on the one side the
staff, with knots, <HI>so that it makes</HI> a Loop on the
other side. <HI>Into this Loop of the Cord</HI> both the
Feet <HI>of the Person Condemned to this Punish∣ment
are put;</HI> then two lusty Fellows, <HI>one at
each end of the staff, lifts it up in their Arms, and</HI>
twisting the Staff about, <HI>till</HI> his Feet are fast
pinc'd with the Cord by the Ankles, <HI>they raise
up his Feet with the Soles upwards, well nigh as
high as their shoulders, and in this posture they
hold them,</HI> the poor man the mean while resting
only with his Neck and Shoulders on the Ground:
<HI>Then comes</HI> another lusty, sturdy Knave <HI>behind
him, and</HI> with a tough, short Truncheon <HI>gives
him as many violent blows on the Soles of his
Feet as the Council shall order.</HI></P>
<P>But the Vice-Roy, with his Council, gathe∣ring
from circumstances, and induced to believe
us by our constant and resolute denial of the
Fact, omitted at present any further punish∣ment▪
and only commanded us <HI>to be laid in chains</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="37" MS="y"/>
<HI>in the Vice-Roy's Prison</HI> till our Patrons should
demand our Liberty, and fetch us out. And
the next day we were both delivered, though
with differing Fates; as <HI>Pharaoh's Chief But∣ler,
and Chief Baker</HI> were both taken from Pri∣son,
<HI>the One to be Advanced, the Other to be
Hanged:</HI> For <HI>John Randal's</HI> Patron being <HI>a
very Termergant,</HI> used that absolute and unlimit∣ted
Sovereignty which they pretend to, over
their Slaves, and commanded him to receive
<HI>three hundred blows upon the Soles of his Feet
with the Battoon,</HI> in manner before descri∣bed:
As for my self, when I was brought home,
the Spie that seized us, came and demanded
Money of my Patron <HI>for his good service</HI> (not
reckoning that he had any thing of me) which
put him into a most desperate fit of Passion, and
calling me <HI>Dog and Jew, and all to naught,</HI> com∣manded
me <HI>to go work in the Looms</HI> with two
other <HI>English-men</HI> that were <HI>Slaves, and Lin∣nen-Cloth-Weavers:</HI>
But alas, I was <HI>a very
Bungler,</HI> and understood nothing of the Craft
and Mystery of Weaving more or less; but
there I wrought till I had spoiled all that I laid
my Hands on: Now, when he saw that my la∣bour
this way would <HI>not turn to Account,</HI> he
rated me for <HI>a Loggerhead,</HI> and bad me <HI>fill
Quills</HI> for the other two; being now degraded
from a <HI>bungling Weaver</HI> to an <HI>excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iller of
Quills,</HI> I continued about a month; my Shop
all this while lay <HI>at sixes and seavens,</HI> what was
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
become of it I knew not, and durst not for my
Life discover any desire to return to that em∣ployment.
At last, my Patron asked me for
the money that he had lent me when I first be∣gan
to Trade: I answered submissively, that I had
not a farthing, all my small Estate lay in a
few Goods, and till they were sold, I could not
possibly repay him: He calls one of his Slaves,
a <HI>Dutch</HI> man, and commands him to go with
me, and turn all into ready money, and bring
it him: When I came to my Old Shop, <HI>there
was the Nest indeed, but all the Birds were slown;</HI>
for in my absence, (poor <HI>John Randal</HI> being
Lame, and not able to work, my Partner some∣time
before having left me, and I confined to
another Employment) some of these Rascals
had broken open my Shop, and thence carried
<HI>the best of my Goods,</HI> though my Cellar was still
safe, and some of my Goods I heard of, and re∣covered;
what money I had was hid in the
Ground, as it was my constant way: That night
the <HI>Dutch</HI> man and my self returned to our Pa∣tron,
and told him we could sell nothing; where∣upon
he remanded me to my Shop, there to
Trade, paying him the two Dollars a moneth,
as I had done before.</P>

was like to be a <HI>Prisoner:</HI> I might be <HI>bought and

<HI>Slavery;</HI> yet one thing methought was comfor∣table,
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
that <HI>the last Instrument of my Bondage</HI>
was come into Misery as well as my self.</P>
<P>In the partage of his Slaves, it fell to <HI>my Lot
and anothers</HI> to be <HI>Mortgaged</HI> for a certain sum
of Money, <HI>joyntly to two Persons,</HI> the one a
Cap-maker, the other a Grave Old Gentleman,
who amongst his own People had the Repute or
<HI>a good Natur'd and moderate Person,</HI> (as <HI>good
Nature, and Moderation</HI> go at <HI>Algier.)</HI> The
Day of Payment <HI>came,</HI> the Mony was <HI>not paid;</HI>
the Cap-maker and the Old Gentleman <HI>seize on
us,</HI> and hold us in <HI>Common,</HI> but in a While they
resolved <HI>to divide us,</HI> that <HI>each of them</HI> might
know his <HI>proper Goods and Chattels,</HI> and <HI>each of
us</HI> might know <HI>whom to call Master,</HI> and <HI>whose
whistle</HI> we were <HI>bound to Obey:</HI> We are both
summoned to appear in a certain place at mid
day, and much ado there was about our Dividing:
At last they agreed <HI>to Cast Lots for us,</HI> onely be∣cause
I was in a handsome way of Trade, it was
accorded, that he to whose share I should fall,
should pay the other fifty Doubles, which, if I
compute aright, is something more then fifty
shillings <HI>Sterling.</HI> I was exceeding fearful I
should fall to this Cap-maker, for he had the
Character of <HI>a brutish, ill-humour'd Creature</HI>
and therefore I was concern'd to lift my Petiti∣on
to God, that seeing, when <HI>the Lot should be
cast into the lap,</HI> yet <HI>the whole Disposition there∣of
is of God,</HI> he would give me <HI>forth a gracious
Lot:</HI> Whatever there is of <HI>Contingency</HI> as to us
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>
there's <HI>nothing accidental</HI> to God. Well, God
Delivered me from <HI>that Tyrant,</HI> and I was ad∣judged
by the decision of the Lot to <HI>the Old Gen∣tleman:</HI>
And if I should be silent here, I should
be the most ungrateful wretch Living: I found
not onely <HI>pity and compassion,</HI> but <HI>Love and
Friendship</HI> from my New Patron? had I been
<HI>his Son,</HI> I could not have met <HI>with more respect,</HI>
nor been treated <HI>with more tenderness:</HI> I could
not wish <HI>a Friend</HI> a better Condition then I was
then in, <HI>except my Bonds.</HI> If any thing could be
mingled with <HI>Bondage</HI> to make it <HI>sweet?</HI> if any
thing could <HI>Reconcile Slavery to Nature?</HI> if any
thing could beget <HI>an Acquiescence</HI> in such a state,
I did not, I could not want it.</P>
<P>And indeed the Freedom that I found in Ser∣vitude,
the Liberty I enjoyed in my Bonds was
so great that it took off <HI>much of the Edg</HI> of my
desire to obtain, and almost blunted it from <HI>any
vigorous attempt</HI> after Liberty, that carried haz∣ard
in it's Face; till at last I was awakened upon
this Occasion.</P>
<P>My Patron had a fair Farm in the Countrey,
about twelve miles from the City, whither he
took me along with him? he had me to their Mar∣kets,
shewed me the manner of them, &amp; at my re∣turn,
he loaded me home <HI>with all manner of good
Provisions, that I might make merry with my Fel∣low-Christians?</HI>
I had some Reason to conclude
<HI>from his great kindness to me,</HI> that he intended to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end me thither to manage the Farm for him. I
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>
saw now evidently, that if I <HI>once quitted my shop▪</HI>
I should lose with it <HI>all means, all helps,</HI> and there∣fore
<HI>all hopes</HI> to rid my self out of this Slavery:
And though I might have been there <HI>a petty Lord,</HI>
and <HI>Bashaw'd</HI> it over the rest of my <HI>Fellow-Ser∣vants,</HI>
yet <HI>Slavery</HI> had in it something of I know
not what <HI>harshness</HI> that I could <HI>not brook. Fetters
of Gold</HI> do not lose their <HI>Nature,</HI> they are <HI>Fet∣ters
still:</HI> Had <HI>Bajazet's</HI> Cage been <HI>of Gold,</HI> as

provocation enough to a <HI>haughty Spirit</HI> to beat
out his own Brains against it's Bars. This there∣fore
quickned my dull temper, and I began to
Resolve to make an Attempt <HI>once for all.</HI> Now
therefore mustering those few Wits Captivity
had left me, I set them on work, and ran through

<P>HAving Formed the Design, or at least, the

my first care was to open it to some <HI>skilful and
faithful Counsellers,</HI> who might more imparti∣ally
discover to me it's <HI>inconveniences,</HI> where it
was like to prove <HI>leaky,</HI> or take <HI>wind;</HI> And
first I acquainted Mr. <HI>Sprat, our Minister,</HI>
with it, and laid before him the whole of the
Contrivance; and he so far approved it, that
he judged it possible: Next, I acquainted one
<HI>Robert Lak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> a very wise and Religious Per∣son,
who bestowed his Blessings on it, and wish'd
it all good Success: And lastly, I acquainted my
Friend <HI>John Randal,</HI> who approved it: Yet
none of these <HI>could,</HI> or <HI>would</HI> run the risque of
it's miscarriage. Mr. <HI>Sprat</HI> was already deli∣vered
from his Patron, and in a fair way to be
absolutely enlarged, in a more safe and Regular
way, for not long after our Escape came Cap∣tain
<HI>Pack,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and paid the sixty Dollars
<PB N="44" REF="41"/>
and took him along with him for <HI>England: John
Randal</HI> had a Wife, and Child and these were
<HI>too dear pledges</HI> to be <HI>left behind,</HI> and yet <HI>too
tender things</HI> to undergo our Difficulties: <HI>Ro∣bert
Lake</HI> was an <HI>Ancient Person,</HI> and neither
able <HI>passively</HI> to be carried in, nor <HI>actively to</HI> car∣ry
on a Design that required much hardness of
Body and Mind to endure, and much strength to
go through with it? we had nothing more from
them then <HI>Prayers and Counsels,</HI> which yet was
<HI>the mane?</HI> and then my next care was, to take
in Partners, and Accomplices in the Design▪</P>
<P>And herein I had a three fold Respect: First
to such as were <HI>necessarily required</HI> to Form the
Instrument of our Escape and Deliverance▪ Se∣condly,
to such, whose <HI>tryed, and approved Fi∣delity</HI>
I might presume would be <HI>obstinately, and
Religiously secret</HI> in concealing it: Thirdly, to
such, whose <HI>Courage of Mind, and strength of
Body</HI> would render them capable to <HI>pursue the
ends of it,</HI> to <HI>put it in Execution,</HI> and <HI>go through
with it.</HI></P>
<P>But before I would reveal the Project to any
of them in particular, I Required an Oath of
Secresie: <HI>That whereas I should now reveal to
him, or them, a matter of great concernment</HI> to
their <HI>Happiness and Well-fare, they should so∣lemnly
promise, and swear, that in case they did
not approve it, or would not joyn in it, yet they
should, neither directly, nor indirectly,; for fear,
or flattery, discover it, or the Persons engaged
<PB N="45" REF="41"/>
in it, to any Person whatsoever.</HI> When a Pro∣ject
was once mentioned, which promised in
general <HI>their Happiness and Well-fare,</HI> I needed
not tell them in particular what it drove at, they
could smell out that with ease; for what could
be <HI>Good, or Happy to Slaves without Liberty?</HI>
This Oath therefore they willingly took: I judg∣ed
<HI>seven Persons</HI> would be enough to manage,
carry on, and Execute it; and therefore except
the three fore-mentioned, I communicated it to
no one Person but these following, who engaged
in it, though all of them did not go through
with it. <HI>John Anthony,</HI> a Carpenter, who
had been <HI>a Slave fifteen years:</HI> his Trade suf∣ficiently
shews, how useful he would prove in
the Design. <HI>William Adams,</HI> who since his
Captivity, had learnt and used the Trade of a
Bricklayer; his Serviceableness in it will be evi∣dent
in the sequel; he had been a Slave eleven
Years. <HI>John Jephs,</HI> who was a Sea-man, and
must therefore be presumed one of the <HI>Quorum</HI>
is a Project of this Nature; he had endured
Slavery about five Years. <HI>John</HI>—a Carpen∣ter,
who was a skilful Man in his Trade, Lusty
of Body, and therefore must be a good Wheel
in this Engine, and he had been a Slave
five Years: And two others, whose Employ∣ment
it was to-wash small Cloaths at the Sea-side,
and those had also their parts in carrying on
the work, though they went not along with us;
and <HI>William Okeley,</HI> who presents the Reader
<PB N="46" REF="42"/>
with this Narrative, who was taken <HI>August 11▪
1639▪</HI> and Escaped <HI>June 30. 1644▪</HI> these made
up the Number of 7. There arose <HI>a Scruple,</HI>
nay, it amounted to a <HI>Question,</HI> whether to at∣tempt
an Escape from my Patron, one that <HI>so
dearly Loved</HI> me, <HI>so courteously treated</HI> me, had
<HI>so fairly bought me,</HI> were justifiable before God
and Men?</P>
<P>And 1. It might be a Question in point
of <HI>Prudence;</HI> for, where could I hope to
<HI>mend my self?</HI> Or better my Condition? I might
possibly find <HI>worse</HI> Quarter in <HI>England,</HI> where
the Civil Wars were now broke out, and to
that height of exasperation, that those of the

hardly give Quarter of Life one to another: If

That dazled my Eyes; surely <HI>where-ever we are
well is our Countrey,</HI> and <HI>all the World is Home
to him that thrives all over the World:</HI> And why
should the <HI>Name of Bondage,</HI> why should <HI>a
word</HI> grate so harshly upon my <HI>delicate Spirit,</HI>
when the sting of it was taken away? <HI>Liberty</HI>
is <HI>a good word;</HI> but a Man <HI>cannot buy a Meals
meat with a word:</HI> And Slavery is <HI>a hard word,</HI>
but <HI>it breaks no mans back.</HI> Thousands <HI>are more

and less at Liberty</HI> then my self, who have the

who might be of <HI>another Character,</HI> and
then my Condition would be therefore wose
because I had known a better.</P>
<P>2. I might be Questioned in point of <HI>Inge∣nuity,</HI>
how I could be so unworthy to leave him,
who had Loved me? <HI>Would</HI> not all that should
hear of it, <HI>Condemn me of ill Nature, to leave</HI>
without taking <HI>leave,</HI> one that had been <HI>a Fa∣ther</HI>
to me, who might have used the Right of
<HI>a Lord;</HI> and <HI>used</HI> me <HI>as a Child,</HI> who might have
treated me <HI>as a Slave?</HI> But really I thought
there was more of <HI>Manners and Courtship</HI> in
the Objection, than of <HI>weight, and Cogency;</HI> Still
<HI>I dwelt with</HI> Meshech, <HI>and had my Habitation
amongst the Tents of</HI> Kedar; and one thought
of <HI>England,</HI> and of its Liberty and Gospel <HI>con∣futed
a thousand such Objections,</HI> and routed
whole Legions of these <HI>little Scruples.</HI> It was
no time to stand upon the <HI>Punctilio's of Honour
and Ingenuity;</HI> no time to <HI>Complement, and
strain courtesie;</HI> here was no <HI>Farewel Patron,</HI>
in the Case, and therefore I soon overcame <HI>that.</HI></P>
<P>But, 3. It might be Questioned in the Court
of Conscience, whether it were not <HI>down-right
Theft</HI> to with-draw my self from <HI>his Service,</HI>
who had <HI>bought</HI> me, <HI>paid</HI> for <HI>me,</HI> enter'd upon
me, <HI>possess'd and enjoy'd me,</HI> as his own <HI>pro∣per
Goods,</HI> and now I was <HI>not my</HI> own, had no
<HI>right to my</HI> self: Whether might not a Man be
<PB N="48" REF="43"/>
<HI>felo de se,</HI> in <HI>stealing himself,</HI> as well as <HI>killing
himself?</HI> And whether he is not the greater <HI>self-robber,</HI>
that steals <HI>away himself,</HI> then he that
steals away <HI>from himself?</HI> But I much question∣ed
<HI>their propriety</HI> to me; my Patron's <HI>Title</HI> was
<HI>rotten</HI> at the <HI>Foundation:</HI> Man is too noble a
Creature to be made subject to <HI>a deed of bar∣gain
and Sale;</HI> and my <HI>consent</HI> was never ask'd
to all their bargains, which is Essential, to create
a right of Dominion over <HI>a Rational Creature,
where he was not born a Subject.</HI> If I had <HI>for∣feited</HI>
my Life or Liberty, <HI>the Law might take
it;</HI> but I was not Conscious to my self of any
<HI>such forfeiture,</HI> but that I was <HI>at my own Dispo∣sal.</HI></P>
<P>Thus all was clear and quiet, and we went on
with our Design, which I now first opened to
them: That I had contrived the Model of a
Boat, which being formed in parcels, and after∣wards
put together, might, by the super-inten∣dency
of Divine Providence, prove <HI>an Ark</HI> to
deliver us out of the hands of our Enemies. This
was soon said, and greedily entertained; to <HI>E∣scape</HI>
was a pleasant <HI>word,</HI> the Name of <HI>Liberty</HI>
made Musick in our Ears, and our wishing hearts
danced to <HI>the Tune of it;</HI> and <HI>a Boat</HI> was as <HI>pro∣mising
a means</HI> as any thing could be imagined:
But when once their thoughts <HI>cooled,</HI> and came
<HI>more sedately</HI> to look into the difficulties of it;
they appeared <HI>innumerable,</HI> and some of them
seemed <HI>insuperable;</HI> and some things that had
<PB N="49" REF="43"/>
past currant in my own thoughts, and I went
clever away with them, without any rub; yet
when they came to be pierced into with <HI>more
Eyes,</HI> and scann'd upon <HI>more Fingers,</HI> they were
attended with considerable impediments: where
this Boat should be built, was one staggering
Question: Where it should be Lanched, and
where put to Sea, was a Choaking Objection:
How we should escape those <HI>Argus</HI>-eyes, which
are always observing us by Day, was a gravel∣ling
Qhaery; or how to get out of the City by
Night, whose Walls are so high, whose Gates
are so close shut, and strongly Guarded was
another vexatious Quaery: How we should be
Rigged and Victualled for such a Voyage, was
a considerable enquiry: and whether we should
design, was not to be slighted. But how <HI>such a
little Skiff,</HI> rather than Boat, should be able <HI>to
Weather all the Accidents of the Sea,</HI> was <HI>a
Neck Question,</HI> enough to <HI>strangle Faith, and
stifle with us with Despair.</HI></P>
<P>To these Objections, I Answered. That I
had designed <HI>my own Cellar,</HI> as the meetest place
wherein to <HI>build the Boat;</HI> that when it was there
Built, it might be taken <HI>in pieces again,</HI> and car∣ried
out of the City <HI>in parcels,</HI> and bestowed in
private places till things were <HI>ripe for Executi∣on.</HI>
That for a place where to put to Sea, it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould be time enough to determine upon that
when we had finish'd our Vessel: That <HI>Mayork</HI>
was the most commodious place to design to
<PB N="50" REF="44"/>
Land in: But in general I told them to this pur∣pose;
That if we <HI>never attempted</HI> any thing till
we had <HI>Answered</HI> all <HI>Objections,</HI> we must sit with
our Fingers in our Mouths all our days, and pine,
and languish out our tedious Lives in Bondage,
<HI>Let us be up and doing, and God would be with
us. To begin is one half of our work;</HI> Let us
make an Essay, and Answer particular Objecti∣ons
as they Offer'd themselves, and as we met
with them in our work. That the Project had
<HI>its difficulties,</HI> was confessed; but what has
not, that is <HI>Commendable, and Glorious?</HI> Yet
whatever difficulties <HI>&amp;</HI> dangers we could meet
with, <HI>Liberty,</HI> kept in <HI>our Eye,</HI> would sweeten
the dangers we might encounter in Attempting▪
They were all well sati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied with what was said
and all engaged to venture the utmost <HI>they were,</HI>
and had, to accomplish it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Model of the Boat, Carrying it out of
the City, and bestowing it in convenient
Places.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Cellar where we had Worship'd God,
we began our Work; and it was <HI>not the Ho∣liness,</HI>
but <HI>the Privacy of the place</HI> that invited
us, and advised us to it. And first, we provi∣ded
<HI>a piece of Timber about twelve Foot long, to
make the Keel:</HI> But because it was impossible
to convey a piece of Timber of that length out
of the City, but it must be seen; and of that
shape, but it must be <HI>suspected,</HI> and that Suspi∣tion
would bring us into <HI>Examination,</HI> and the
<HI>Rack, or Battoon</HI> might extort <HI>a Confession</HI> out
of the <HI>mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t resolved, and obstinate breast;</HI> we
therefore cut it <HI>in</HI> two pieces, and fitted it for
Joynting thus in the middle. Our next care
was the <HI>Timbers or Ribs</HI> of the Poat, which
we contrived thus; every one of the Timbers
was <HI>made</HI> of three <HI>pieces,</HI> and joynted in two
<HI>places,</HI> because a whole Rib at its full length,
would <HI>be</HI> lyable <HI>to the</HI> same inconveniences with
the Keel. Now understand, that the joynts of
the Ribs were not made with <HI>Mortice and Te∣non,</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="45"/>
but the flat side of one of the three Pieces
was laid over the other, and <HI>two holes</HI> were bo∣red
at <HI>every joynt,</HI> into which <HI>two Nails</HI> were
to be put, when we should <HI>joyn the parcels</HI> of our
Boat together: You must understand further,
that <HI>these two holes at every joynt</HI> were not made
in a <HI>strait line, parallel with the sides</HI> of the pieces,
for then the three pieces, which make one Rib,
being joyned together would have made <HI>one
strait piece;</HI> a Form which would by no means
comport with the Use and Design of the Tim∣bers;
But so, that when <HI>both the Nails were in
the holes,</HI> each Joynt would make <HI>an obtuse an∣gle,</HI>
and so incline so near towards <HI>a Semi-Circu¦lar
Figure,</HI> as our Occasion required. All this
while here is no visible Provision made <HI>for
boards,</HI> to cloath the naked Ribs of our Boat,
without which, the Keel and Timbers looked
but like an useless Anatomy; but neither had
we, nor was it possible we should have any
boards in our Vessel: <HI>Necessity</HI> is the best Arti∣ficer
when all is done, if we accept her Sister
<HI>Contingency;</HI> to which two the World has been
beholden for the most useful inventions, which
at this day do ease the Labour and Toyl of wea∣ried
Mankind. For the Joynting of these Boards;
and the Nailing of them, to make the Boat <HI>Wa∣ter-tite,</HI>
would require such <HI>Hammering,</HI> and
that Hammering would make <HI>such a clamarou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Echo</HI> in the Cellar, as must have drawn upon
us the Jealous Eyes of the <HI>Algerines,</HI> who
<PB N="53" REF="45"/>
<HI>about their Wives and Slaves are insupportably
suspicious:</HI> And therefore from the first Con∣ception
of the Design, I always resolved upon
<HI>a Canvas:</HI> In pursuance of which thought, be∣ing
all satisfied that it was <HI>practicable;</HI> we bought
as much strong Canvas as would cover our Boat
<HI>twice over,</HI> upon the <HI>Convex of the Carine;</HI>
We provided also as much <HI>Pitch, Tar, and
Tallow</HI> as would serve to make it a kind of <HI>a
Tawparlin Sear-cloth,</HI> to swaddle <HI>the naked
body of our Infant-Boat:</HI> With Earthen pots
to melt done our Materials in; and prefixt a
night wherein we might Execute that part of our
Labour. The <HI>two Carpenters, and my self</HI> were
appointed to this Service, and the Cellar was
the place where we met. Matters had hither∣to
run very evenly, and smoothly, but here
we met with some <HI>discouraging rubs.</HI> For when
we had stopt all the Chinks and Crannies of the
Cellar, that the streame of the melted Materials
might not creep out and betray us, (there be∣ing
no Chimney,) we had not been long at our
work before I felt my self exceeding sick, with
the strong, and unusual scent of the melted Li∣quor;
I was forced to go out into the streets to
<HI>gasp for breath,</HI> where meeting with the <HI>cool
Air,</HI> it over-came me, I swooned, fell down
brake my face, and there lay: My Compa∣nions
missing me, made out to seek me, found
me in this sad plight, and carried me in again,
though exceeding sick, and unserviceable. They
<PB N="54" REF="46"/>
had not proceeded much further before I heard
one of them complain he was sick, and cou'd
proceed no further, and now our work stood
still: I plainly saw that <HI>our hopeful Project,</HI> that
had hitherto so smoothly proceeded, must needs
miscarry, and Prove Abortive; for it would be
impossible to finish it <HI>this night:</HI> and if we once
<HI>parted,</HI> and suffered our Spirits <HI>to cool over</HI> the
<HI>Design,</HI> they would never cease cooling till they
were <HI>stone-cold, and hard frozen;</HI> and there∣fore
I advised to set open the Door, and com∣mit
our selves, and our work to Gods Protecti∣on:
For I told them they could not but know,
that <HI>if any Discovery</HI> were <HI>made, the burden</HI>
would <HI>fall heaviest upon my shoulders;</HI> and my
<HI>Back or Feet must pay for all.</HI> At length, we
resolved to set the Cellar-door wide open, and
as soon as that was done, and the stream pretty
well gone out, we came to our selves again, cou∣ragiously
went <HI>on</HI> with our business, and pitched
one half that Night. The next night we met
again, set open the Door, and whilst they <HI>plyed</HI>
the work, I stood Sentinel at the Door to give
Notice of <HI>approaching</HI> danger; but we <HI>happily</HI>
finish'd the whole, and while it was yet dark,
carried it to my Shop, which was about a Fur∣long
from the Cellar, and there at present secu∣red
it.</P>
<P>I shall not question the Readers Ingenuity so
much, but that he will <HI>suppose</HI> there goes a
<HI>great deal more to a Boat</HI> than I have described;
<PB N="55" REF="46"/>
but what should I trouble him with those things
that <HI>are common to all other Boats,</HI> I mention
only what was <HI>Peculiar to our own;</HI> and I do
not intend to trouble him with <HI>the Boat-wright's
Lecture.</HI></P>
<P>In our Cellar we fitted all things, we made
the Timbers fit to the Keel, and the Canvas fit
for the Timbers, and the Seats fit to the whole,
and then took all in pieces again, and laying our
Heads together, plotting how to convey all out
of the Town, and lodg them in secure and tru∣sty
places.</P>
<P>And first▪ <HI>for our Keel,</HI> we all with unani∣mous
consent judged <HI>Will. Adams</HI> the fittest
Person to execute that part of the Design, for
he had long Exercised the Trade of a Brick-lay∣er,
and his Employment lay much without the
Town; and besides, he used such pieces in level∣ling
his work. He therefore; accourted with
his <HI>Apron before him, his Trowel in his hand,</HI> and
one of the pieces <HI>upon his shoulder,</HI> undertook
it, and without the least Observation went cle∣verly
away with it, and as he saw his Opportu∣nity,
hid it in the bottom of a Hedg; and not
long after conveyed out its Fellow, and Lodged
it in the same place. This succeeding so hap∣pily,
we saw no great difficulty <HI>in the Timbers,</HI>
for we put <HI>one nail into a hole of every joynt,</HI> and
then you will easily conceive, that <HI>the two ex∣tream
pieces of one Rib</HI> being <HI>folded inwards
upon the middlemost,</HI> will lye <HI>in the room of one
<PB N="56" REF="47"/>
of the pieces for length,</HI> excepting that litile that
<HI>the ends of each piece</HI> were beyond the holes:
Now, by general consent, the conveying these
out of the City was committed to one, whose
Employment was to wash small Clothes by the
Sea-side: He puts them into his bag amongst his
Clothes, and so very orderly carried them out,
and hid them where he could find <HI>most commodi∣ous
stowage,</HI> but yet <HI>with Respect to nearness to
that Place</HI> where the Keel was laid.</P>
<P>But how to convey <HI>our Tarpawlin</HI> safe out of
Town seemed most difficult; by night it was
impossible, and by day the difficulties very con∣siderable,
and the danger <HI>proportionable; for the
Gates</HI> are strictly watch'd, the <HI>Streets</HI> crowded,
the <HI>Spies pickering</HI> in every corner, and <HI>the
bulk of the Canvas</HI> thus dressed was very great.
To <HI>divide it</HI> had been to <HI>ruin our selves,</HI> for no
stitching together again, could so <HI>cheat the sear∣ching
water,</HI> but it would find out <HI>the needle-holes.</HI>
At last we ventured upon this way; we
put it into a large Sack, and committed it to him
that used <HI>to wash Clothes,</HI> and lest any should
clap a jealous hand upon it, we put a Pillow over
our Canvas within the bag, that so its softness
might delude the Inquisitor, and make it pass
for Clothes. Let none dispise, or condemn these
as <HI>low, mean pieces of contrivance,</HI> for we had
not <HI>Polititians tools to work withal;</HI> but the less
was <HI>our Policy,</HI> the more glorious does <HI>the wis∣dom
of God</HI> shine in succeeding it, and yet even
<PB N="57" REF="47"/>
<HI>that little</HI> Policy we were guilty of, was of <HI>his
bestowing</HI> also; <HI>what of sin</HI> was in all of it, was
entirely <HI>our own;</HI> what of <HI>Power, Wisdom, and
Success,</HI> was <HI>all his:</HI> But our Agent escaped
happily with it, and Lodging it in a secret place,
returned.</P>
<P>We had yet many things to provide, and
Oars are absolutely necessary, they were of <HI>the
Quorum</HI> to an Escape <HI>by sea:</HI> As <HI>Finns</HI> are the
<HI>Fishes Oars,</HI> so <HI>Oars</HI> are the <HI>Boats Finns,</HI> by
help whereof she makes her way: Now, to
supply this defect, we took <HI>two Pipe-staves,</HI> and
slitting them a cross from corner to corner with
a Hand-saw, we made of each Pipe-staff two
Rude things, which Necessity was pleased to
entitle <HI>The blades for a pair of Oars,</HI> and these
were easily conveyed out, without suspition.</P>
<P>Next, we considered, that <HI>Provision</HI> must be
laid in for <HI>our Voyage;</HI> and therefore we provi∣ded
<HI>a small,</HI> and but <HI>a small quantity of Bread,</HI>
presuming our stay at Sea must be but short;
for either we should speedily <HI>recover Land,</HI> or
speedily <HI>be drown'd,</HI> or speedily be <HI>brought back
again:</HI> Two Goats skins also, stript off whole,
and so Tann'd (a kind of Bottle much used by
the <HI>Algerines</HI> to carry Milk and Water in) we
had, which <HI>we lived</HI> with <HI>fresh water,</HI> and we
know <HI>that</HI> must needs be <HI>a great Rarity in the
Mediterranean.</HI></P>
<P>We remembred also that <HI>a Sail</HI> might be of
right good use to us <HI>for expedition,</HI> and there∣fore
<PB N="58" REF="48"/>
we bought as much <HI>Canvas</HI> as would <HI>An∣swer
that End;</HI> and when some Dispute was
made abou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> carrying it out, I Offered to under∣take
<HI>that last part of our work:</HI> I had not gone
a quarter of a Mile, but as I cast my wary eye
back, I espyed <HI>the same spie,</HI> who once before
had seized me, and given me trouble, follow∣ing
me very roundly. My Heart began to ake;
I was loth <HI>a Design of so near, and dear con∣cernment
to all of us,</HI> should be <HI>brought to the
Birth, and there should be no strength to bring
forth.</HI> It's sad, <HI>after a Voyage,</HI> to ship-wrack
<HI>in the Haven,</HI> but me-thought it was <HI>more sad</HI>
to <HI>sink a Vessel before it could be Launched:</HI> And
here I first found the difference between <HI>Inno∣cence
and Guilt;</HI> for how boldly could I hold up
my head to <HI>this Spie,</HI> and his <HI>betters,</HI> (at least,
his <HI>Masters)</HI> when I was not Conscious of any
such <HI>Design in hand?</HI> Where as now the Re∣flection
of my <HI>Conscience.</HI> was enough to write
<HI>guilt</HI> in <HI>my Countenance,</HI> (for some things are
sin <HI>there</HI> which are not so in <HI>other places:)</HI> and
this had betray'd me, had I not suddenly pluckt
up my spirits, and spying an <HI>English-man</HI> wash∣ing
Clothes by the Sea, I went the ready way to
him, and desired him to help me wash that Can∣vas;
as we were washing it, <HI>the learing Spye</HI>
came and stood upon the Rock just over our
Heads to watch our motions: As soon as we had
<HI>a little formally</HI> wash'd it, to cast a Mist before
his Observing Eyes, I took the Canvas and spred
<PB N="59" REF="48"/>
it before his Face upon the top of the Rock to
dry; he staid his own Time, and then march'd
off. But I was as Jealous of him, as he could
be of me for his Heart; and therefore fearing
he might lye in Ambush for me, took it when
'twas dry, and very fairly carried it back into
the City, and faithfully acquainted my Accom∣plices
how the Matter squared. This Discora∣ged
them not a little, for that they seemed timo∣rous
to proceed in the Enterprize.</P>
<P>At last we comforted, and encouraged one
another, and entred into close Counsel, where
we should <HI>meet that Night?</HI> At <HI>what time?</HI>
Where we should <HI>put our Boat together,</HI> and
where <HI>put to Sea?</HI> The Time was an hour with∣in
Night; the Rendevouz on <HI>a Hill,</HI> about
half a Mile from the Sea; and so we dispersed,
some one way, some another; and privily lurk∣ing
in Hedges and Ditches, lay close till the
time appointed.</P>
<P>There is one thing that the Reader will be
ready to ask; and I shall be <HI>more ready to An∣swer</HI>
him for a special Reason: <HI>viz.</HI> What I
did with my Shop and Goods? When I had once
Resolved upon this Adventure, and saw it go on
hopefully, I gave my Patron my wonted Visits;
kept fair Correspondence, paid him his demands
duly, but secretly I made off my Goods as fast
as I could, and turn'd all into ready Money: I
had a Trunk, for which <HI>John Anthony</HI> made me
<HI>a false bottom;</HI> into which I put what Silver or
<PB N="60" REF="49"/>
Gold I had? and into the Body of the Trunk,
what ever it would <HI>hold,</HI> and was <HI>worthy holding:</HI>
This Trunk I committed privately to the Fide∣lity
of our dear Minister, Mr. <HI>Sprat;</HI> he took the
charge of it, and he was now ready to receive
his full Discharge. This Trunk he <HI>Faithfully
Secured,</HI> and <HI>carefully brought over,</HI> and as <HI>ho∣nestly
delivered</HI> to me when he heard I was come
safe to <HI>London;</HI> and I was willing to move <HI>that
Question,</HI> merely for <HI>the Answers sake,</HI> which

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The putting off our Boat together, the Dif∣ficulties
we met with therein; and our
putting out to Sea, June 30. 1644.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as we were met all together at the
appointed place; we began to think of Ex∣ecuting
our long intended Design; but we were
divided in our Counsels, where to begin our
work: It had been a Question propounded be∣fore,
and <HI>we thought</HI> we had fully resolved upon
<HI>the place;</HI> but at our Meeting we were <HI>strangely
discomposed:</HI> There were <HI>two places</HI> which stood
in Competition, each pretending good Conve∣niences
for that end. The one was <HI>a Hill,</HI> about
half a Mile from the Sea; the other was <HI>a Val∣ley,</HI>
encompassed with two Hedges, about a
Furlong from the Hill, but of the same distance
with it from the Sea: It was urged for the Val∣ley,
that it was a place of <HI>more Secrecy and Pri∣vacy,</HI>
less obvious to view; but then it was ob∣jected,
that we might there <HI>be surprized, and
seized</HI> by the Churches of our Enemies, e're we
could have notice to shift for our selves: For the
Hill, it had been argued, that we might there
<HI>make better Discovery</HI> of Danger, and <HI>make
Provision to avoyd it;</HI> and in short, we all agreed
<PB N="62" REF="50"/>
<HI>over night,</HI> to put our Boat together <HI>upon the
Hill;</HI> promising our selves much Advantage
from <HI>its Scituation:</HI> But when we were met,
we all altered our Resolution <HI>without any visible
Reason,</HI> and carried it for the Valley▪ God is
much <HI>in the dark to us,</HI> but all our wayes <HI>are in
the open Light to him.</HI> It's very difficult to give
an Account <HI>what God is doing at present,</HI> but we
shall know, if we can but patiently wait till <HI>fu∣ture
Providences</HI> Comment upon <HI>the former:</HI>
And in a while we saw the Reason why God
over-ruled our purposes.</P>
<P>We had hid several of our Materials near <HI>the
top of the Hill,</HI> where also grew a small Fig-tree,
which we had marked with our Eye, as Judging
it would be useful to strengthen the Keel of our
Boat: Two of our Company were immediately
dispatcht to <HI>saw down this Fig-Tree,</HI> and bring
it, and the parcels of our Boat there disposited
away with them: They were hardly come to
the place, but we heard Dogs bark about the
top of the Hill, and indeed two Men with Dogs
came very near them; but our Men being aware
lay close and still, and so they passed by with∣out
making any Discovery, and then our Men
bestirr'd themselves, and brought away the
Fig-Tree, and the other Materials, and retur∣ned
to us.</P>
<P>And now we had once more brought the scat∣ter'd
Limbs of our Boat into one place, which,
like those of <HI>Absyrtus,</HI> had been dispersed up
<PB N="63" REF="50"/>
and down the Fields: It was no time to trifle,
&amp; therefore we all buckled to our work in good
earnest: But we were so nigh some that were at
work in the Neighbouring Gardens, that we
could hear them speak, and therefore must needs
suppose they might hear us too; and therefore
we Acted by Signs, and pointed, and pulled,
and nodded, but were <HI>all Mutes:</HI> It might have
been an Expedient for the Builders of <HI>Babel,</HI>
when their Languages were Divided, to have
carried on their great Project by Signs: but cer∣tainly
there was Confusion poured out <HI>upon their
Hearts and Counsels,</HI> as well as Division in <HI>their
Tongues and Languages.</HI></P>
<P>The two parts of our Keel we soon joyned;
then opening the Timbers, which had already
<HI>one Nail in every Joynt,</HI> we groped out for <HI>the
other hole;</HI> and put <HI>its Nail</HI> into it: Then we
open'd them at their full length, and applyed
them to the top of the Keel, fastning them with
<HI>Rope-Yarn,</HI> and small Cords; and so we served
all the Joynts to keep them <HI>firm and stable;</HI> then
we bound <HI>small Canes</HI> all along the Ribs <HI>length-ways,</HI>
both to keep the Ribs <HI>from vering,</HI> and
also <HI>to bear out the Canvas very stiff against the
pressing water:</HI> Then we made <HI>Notches</HI> upon
the ends of the <HI>Ribs, or Timbers,</HI> wherein <HI>the
Oars might plye;</HI> and having tyed down the Seats,
and strengthned our Keel with the Fig-Tree, we
lastly drew on our double Canvas Case, <HI>already
fitted;</HI> and really <HI>the Canvas</HI> seemed a <HI>Winding-sheet
<PB N="64" REF="51"/>
sheet for our Boat;</HI> and our <HI>Boat a Coffin for
us all.</HI></P>
<P>This done, four of our Company took it upon
their shoulders, and carried it down towards the
Sea, which was about half a Mile off: It was
a little Representation of a <HI>Funeral,</HI> to see <HI>the

it's not usual for <HI>any</HI> to wait upon <HI>their own
Coffins:</HI> But we durst not grudg our Boat that
<HI>small, and last Office,</HI> to carry it <HI>half a Mile,</HI>
for we expected, it should repay us that Ser∣vice

<HI>many a League:</HI> We carried it at Land, where
it could <HI>not swim;</HI> that it might carry us at Sea,
where we could <HI>not walk.</HI> As we went along,
they that were in the Gardens heard us passing
by, and called to us, <HI>who comes there?</HI> But it
was dark, and we had no mind to prate, and
therefore without any Answer, we silently held
on our way.</P>
<P>When we came to the Sea-side, we immedi∣ately
stript ourselves naked, and putting our
Clothes into the Boat, carried it, and them, as
far into the Sea as we could wade; and this we
did, lest <HI>our tender Boat</HI> should pe <HI>toren against
the Stones or Rocks;</HI> and then all seven of us
got into her: But here we soon found how our

but she was ready to sink under us, the water
coming in over the sides? so that once again we
must entertain new Counsels▪ at last, one <HI>whose
Heart most failed him,</HI> was willing to be shut out;
and rather hazard the <HI>uncertain Torments of the
Land,</HI> than <HI>certainly be drown'd at Sea;</HI> then
we made a second Experiment, but still she was
so deep Laden, that we all concluded there was
no venturing out to Sea: At length, <HI>another</HI>

our selves, and Vessel to the Protection, and
Conduct of that God <HI>who Rules the Winds and

Sins, and resigning up our souls to God, as if
we had been presently to suffer Death by the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The great Extremities we Endured at Sea
for Six Dayes, and Nights, with the Co∣incident
Providences of God that ap∣peared
for us in our Extremities, and
our Miraculous Landing at Mayork,
July 6. 1644.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now out at Sea without Helm, or
Pilot; without Anchor, Tackle, or
Compass; but God was <HI>these. all these, and
more then all these.</HI> Our Number was <HI>Small,</HI>
our Work was <HI>Great,</HI> we could not afford one
<HI>Idle Hand,</HI> not one idle <HI>Finger:</HI> Four of the
Company continually wrought at the Oars; and
indeed we <HI>wrought for our Lives,</HI> and then I
shall not need to say <HI>how we wrought:</HI> But this
<HI>I shall</HI> say, I <HI>can truly</HI> say it, I never saw strength
<HI>so strained,</HI> nor the utmost of what <HI>Nature
could do</HI> for <HI>Life and Liberty,</HI> exerted so much
in all my Life. The Employment of the fifth
Man was <HI>more easie,</HI> but no less necessary, which
was to free the Boat of that water, which by
Degrees leak't through our Canvas.</P>
<P>We Labour'd the harder <HI>that Night,</HI> because
we would gladly be out of the Ken of our Old
<PB N="68" REF="54"/>
Masters <HI>by Day;</HI> but when Day appear'd, we
were yet within sight of the Ships that lay in the
Haven, and Road, and off the Land: But our
Boat being small, and lying close, and snug up∣on
the Sea, either was not at all discovered, or
else seemed something that was not worth the
taking up: A <HI>little hope</HI> in the midst of <HI>great
Fears,</HI> made us double, and re-double our Di∣ligence;
we tugg'd at the Oars like those who
are <HI>Chain'd to the Gallies,</HI> because we had no
mind to be <HI>Slaves</HI> to our Old Patrones in <HI>their
Gallies.</HI></P>
<P>But upon all Occasions we found our want of
fore-cast, for now our Bread, which was to be
the staff of our decayed strength, had lie soak∣ing
in the Salt water, like a drunken Toast sopt
in Brine, and was quite spoiled: And our fresh
water in the Bottles stank of the Tann'd Skins,
and Owze, having lye sobbing in the Salt water
which made it nauceous: But yet that hope that
hover'd over us, and flatter'd us that we should
one day mend our Commons, sweeten'd all a∣gain;
<HI>so long as Bread was Bread,</HI> we com∣plained
not: Three days with good Husbandry
it lasted, but then pale Famine (which is the
worst sheap Death can be painted in) stared us
in the Face; And there was no substitute for
Bread at Sea: At Land, the Roots of Grass the
tops of Trees, and the vilest Excrements have
served to stop the clamour of a Ravenous Sto∣mach,
but that which Slaves despised, we should
<PB N="69" REF="54"/>
have admired, and prized: Water indeed we
might have, <HI>either cold, or hot;</HI> we had choice,
but it was <HI>a hard choice:</HI> Either the <HI>cold salt
weter</HI> out of the Sea, or <HI>that warmer</HI> which
had been strained through our Bodies, and that
we chose <HI>of the two,</HI> but we must not have that,
<HI>after a while,</HI> unless we would first accept <HI>the
other:</HI> And the Misery was, these did not <HI>as∣swage</HI>
our thirst, but <HI>increase it;</HI> nor <HI>increase
our strength,</HI> but <HI>diminish it;</HI> yet these were
the <HI>means of Life:</HI> Strange means, that would
destroy <HI>the End.</HI></P>
<P>Several things added to our Misery; for trou∣ble
seldom comes solitary: For first, we had
the Wind <HI>for some time</HI> full against us: And this
was both an evil in <HI>its self,</HI> an evil in <HI>its effect,</HI>
and an evil <HI>in its cause.</HI> It was a great evil <HI>in it
self;</HI> it <HI>increased</HI> our Labour, and then <HI>defeated
it:</HI> We Rowed <HI>harder</HI> to <HI>less purpose:</HI> we <HI>mo∣ved,</HI>
but did not <HI>advance!</HI> we <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent our strength
for nought, and in vain.</HI> It was an <HI>evil in its
effect;</HI> for it engaged <HI>the Waters</HI> against us, and
drew them into <HI>its prey,</HI> The Sea is <HI>a perfect
Neuter</HI> of it self, and willing to maintain <HI>its
Neutrality;</HI> but the powerful Winds drew her
<HI>into the Faction:</HI> And that Sea which serves <HI>the
North</HI> to day, shall comply with the <HI>more pre∣vailing
South</HI> to Morrow; for <HI>the Waves are
the greatest time-servers</HI> in the World: But it
was far the greatest <HI>evil in its Cause;</HI> for the
<HI>Winds being against us,</HI> argued that <HI>God was
<PB N="70" REF="55"/>
against us;</HI> for the Wind we know was <HI>his:
He brings the Winds out of his Magazines.</HI> We
were now so dispirited, that we debated, <HI>whe∣ther
we should bare up with the Wind, or make
the best of our way, and Row against it?</HI> That
is, whether it were not better to go back to <HI>Al∣gires
with ease,</HI> then <HI>painfully</HI> make towards
<HI>Freedom?</HI> At last like Persons that though we
knew not what to do, yet resolved not to return;
we resolved whilst we had Life, and strength,
and Breath, we would struggle with it: And
now the great God interposed; he rebuked <HI>his
Wind;</HI> it was <HI>not against us;</HI> nay he <HI>reconciled</HI>
his Wind, and it became <HI>our Friend.</HI> He that
can turn the <HI>Rivers in the South,</HI> could turn <HI>the
Winds out of the North:</HI> Here we might have
had a notable demonstration of Gods Soverign∣ty.
He determined the <HI>Quarter</HI> of the Wind,
the <HI>Quantity</HI> of the Wind, and the <HI>Continuance</HI>
of the Wind. The Quarter, <HI>whence</HI> it should
blow The; Quantity, <HI>how much</HI> it should blow,
and the Continuance, <HI>how long it should blow.</HI>
The Quarter was our Enemy, the Continuance
had quite brought us to Despair; but had he
opened his Hand, and let out <HI>one blast more,</HI> the
proud <HI>Waters had gone over our Souls, we had
perished in the deep:</HI> But we see that <HI>our times
are in Gods Hand;</HI> the Ocean in the <HI>hollow of
the same Hand,</HI> and the Winds <HI>in the same hand;</HI>
and Happy it was for us, that <HI>we, and they,
were all there.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="55"/>
A Second great Inconveniency was, that <HI>our
Labour was without Intermission,</HI> though we ad∣vanced
<HI>not forwards</HI> at many stroaks, yet cessa∣tion
had driven us <HI>backwards.</HI> The poor Sen∣tinel
that stands upon the Watch, yet comforts
himself that another will Relive him; but we
had none to take the toyl off our Hands, and
give us Respite: We might <HI>shift our places, but
not our pains.</HI></P>
<P>A Third great Evil that lay sore upon us, was
the extremity of the <HI>heat by day;</HI> the Season
was Raging hot, being the beginning of <HI>July;</HI>
the Climent was hot, being under, or about the
Fourth Climate; we wanted fresh Water to
cool the Heat, and were engagad in continual
Labour to <HI>enrage the heat,</HI> and all these made it
insupportable to <HI>our Bodies,</HI> and our <HI>little, or
no hope,</HI> (which now like a Candle burnt down
to the Socket, did rather blink, than burn) made
it <HI>grievous to our Souls.</HI> One small help we had
(if it was a help) that the fifth Man, who emp∣tyed
the Boat of the Salt Water, threw it upon
the Bodies of the rest to cool them; But this was
<HI>a Miserable Remedy,</HI> for our Bodies were so
bleached between the scorching Sun, and the
cooling Water, that they rose up in Blisters all
over. Great pain we felt, great danger we were
in, great Miseries were endured, great wants
we were under, and had <HI>nothing little,</HI> but <HI>hope,
food, and strength.</HI> By Day we were all stark
Naked, by Night we had our Shirts, or loose
<PB N="72" REF="56"/>
Coats, and that was all our Cloathing, the rest
we left a shore to ease our Boat.</P>
<P>If any shall be so Inquisitive, as to ask, <HI>by
what Directions</HI> we steared our Course, that we
did not tack about insensibly in the dark Night
or Day? He may know, that for <HI>the Day,</HI> one
of the Company had <HI>a Pocket-Dyal,</HI> which sup∣plyed
the place of the Compass, ee'n well e∣nough
for such a Vessel, and such Mariners. By
Night when <HI>the Stars appeared,</HI> we had our
advice from them, and when they dis-appeared,
we ghessed at our way by <HI>the Motions of the
Clouds.</HI></P>
<P>In this sad &amp; woeful plight we continued four
Dayes and Nights; on the fifth Day, we were
<HI>on the brink of the brink of despair,</HI> and all
hope that we should be saved, utterly perished.
And now, as persons despairing of <HI>the End,</HI> we
ceased to pursue <HI>the means;</HI> laid by our Oars,
left off our Labour; either we had no strength
left, or were loth to throw away that little we
had to no purpose, only we kept still emptying
the Boat; loth to drown, loth to dye, yet knew
no wayes to avoyd Death: When the <HI>End is re∣moved,</HI>
all <HI>means perish</HI> with it.</P>
<P>They that act least, commonly wish the most:
thus when we had left <HI>fruitless Labour,</HI> we fell
upon <HI>fruitless wishes,</HI> that we might meet with
some Vessel, some Ship to take us up▪ If it
was <HI>but a Ship,</HI> we considered <HI>no further; Eng∣lish,
or African, Tross, Tyriusve;</HI> all was a
<PB N="73" REF="56"/>
Case: Or if not, yet <HI>the worst was better than
our bad case;</HI> and therefore resolved, could we
have Discovered any Ship, to have made to∣wards
her, though it had been one of <HI>Algiers:</HI>
How many wisht themselves again <HI>in Egypt,</HI>
when they Combated with the un-expected
Difficulties of <HI>the Wilderness!</HI> How oft have
the People of God been more afraid of <HI>the means
of thier Deliverance,</HI> than of <HI>their Danger!</HI>
When Christ came to save his Disciples from the
Storm, yet because he came in a way uncouth,
and unexpected, <HI>they cryed out for fear,</HI> Mat.
14. 26. Whether the Reader will pity, or con∣demn
us, I know not; but to that pass were we
now brought, that we would have accepted Life
upon any terms, <HI>not base and sinful;</HI> and whether
we should have stuck <HI>at such or no,</HI> I have no such
security from my own Heart as to resolve
him.</P>
<P>Whilst we were at <HI>this dead Ebbe</HI> of Hope,
the Great God, whose most Glorious <HI>Opportu∣nity</HI>
to help, is his Creatures <HI>greatest Extremi∣ty:</HI>
He that appeared for <HI>Abraham in the
Mount,</HI> and to the <HI>three Young Men in the Fie∣ry
Furnace;</HI> he that Delivered <HI>Israel at the Sea,
at the Red Sea;</HI> he who times all his Mercies
for their Advantage: even He sent us some Re∣lief,
and a <HI>little Relief</HI> is <HI>great,</HI> in <HI>great exigen∣cies.</HI>
As we lay hulling up and down, we Dis∣covered
a Tortoise not far from us asleep in the
Sea. Had the great <HI>Drake</HI> Discovered the <HI>Spa∣nish
<PB N="74" REF="57"/>
Plate-Fleet,</HI> he could not have more Re∣joyced;
once again we bethought our selves of
our Oars; and now our little Boat shewed it
self to be of <HI>the right breed of Algiers,</HI> made of
<HI>Piratick Timber,</HI> and to its poor Abbility would
become <HI>a Corsair;</HI> we silently Rowed to our
Prey, took it into the Boat with great Triumph,
we cut off her Head, and let her bleed into a
Pot; we drank the Blood, eat the Liver,
and suck'd the Flesh; <HI>warm Flesh, and hot Li∣quor</HI>
(except our own) had been <HI>a great Ra∣rity</HI>
with us a long time, it was a Novelty of
Providence; and really it wonderfully refresh'd
our Spirits, repaired our decayed strength and
recruited Nature; at least, poor exhausted Na∣ture
was willing to be cheated, and fancy her
self recruited: But there was no cheat in't we
were really refresh'd, and with fresh vigour and
courage fell to our Work; we left our fears be∣hind
us, we pickt up some scatter'd crumbs of
hope, and about Noon, we Discovered, or
thought we Discovered Land. It's impossible
to express the Joy, and Triumph of our raised
Souls at this apprehension. The Poets tell us,
that as often as <HI>Hercules</HI> threw the great Giant
against <HI>the Earth,</HI> his <HI>Mother Earth</HI> gave him
<HI>new strength</HI> against the next Encounter: It was
<HI>new strength, new Life</HI> to us, though <HI>not to touch</HI>
yet <HI>to see;</HI> or if <HI>not to see,</HI> to <HI>think we saw</HI> it.
It brought fresh Blood into our Veins, fresh co∣our
into our pale Cheeks; we look'd <HI>not</HI> like
<PB N="75" REF="57"/>
Men awaked from sleep, <HI>not</HI> like Captives broke
from the Chains of <HI>Algiers,</HI> but like Persons
<HI>raised from the Dead.</HI> But <HI>Hope and Fear
made a strange Medly Passion in our Souls;</HI> like
the Reparties of two contrary jostling Tides, or
the struggling of the Eddy with the main Stream;
Hope would perswade us that we saw the Land;
but chill Fear bad us pause upon it, for as we
easily believe, what we desire to be true, so
we are as ready to fear lest it should not prove
true; for fear had got long possession of our
Souls, and would hardly admit Hope to stir, but
was ready to suppress it as a disturber of its
Empire: We had seen nothing but Air, and
Sea; Sea, and Air in five Dayes and Nights;
that though our Reason tould us there was such a
thing as Land, yet the Impressions that fear had
made upon us, made it Questionable, whether
ever we should see it. And we durst not give
too much Credence to our Eyes, that had been
used to bring sadder stories to our Hearts.</P>
<P>Yet still we wrought hard: Hope did us that
kindness it put us upon an earnest desire to see,
whether we were deceived or no. After some
further Labour, we grew more confident, and
at last, fully satisfied that it was Land: I hope
I shall never foeget what a sense we had of Gods
goodness upon that Assurance. Extreams do
equally annoy, and sometimes infatuate the
mind: They tell us, that in <HI>Greenland,</HI> the ex∣tremity
of Cold will make the Iron stick to the
<PB N="76" REF="58"/>
Fingers, as our Experience assures extremity of
Heat will do; for now like Distracted Persons,
we all leapt into the Sea, quitting our Boat, and
being all good Swimmers, we there Bathed, and
cooled our heated Bodies. An Adventure,
which, if well considered, had as much of the
Desperado in it as our putting to Sea: For now
we were at the Mercy of the Sharks; which
might have sheared off a Leg, or Arm; and now
our over-heated Bodies were open to receive the
Impressions of that Cold Element: But as we
never considered our Danger, the great and
good God delivered us from the Ordinary ef∣fects
of such Folly; we presently returned to
our Boat, and being both wearied with Labour,
and cooled a little with the Sea, we lay us all
down to Sleep in as much security, as if we had
been in our own Beds: Nature being almost
spent, must have a Truce; she will not under∣take
to keep our Bodies upon their Legs, if we
will not submit to her great standing Ordi∣nance
of Rest; and here we saw still more of
Divine Goodness, that our Leaky Vessel did not
bury us in the Sea, and we awaking find our
selves in the other World: But he that <HI>gave us
Sleep, measured it;</HI> and he measured it <HI>exactly,</HI>
not suffering us to <HI>out-sleep the Season</HI> of plying
our Pump, or that which supplyed the place of
it.</P>
<P>Being thus refresh'd with sleep, we found <HI>new
strength</HI> for our Work, and God found us <HI>new
<PB N="77" REF="58"/>
Work</HI> for our strength: We tugged the harder
at the Oar, because we hoped e'er Night to sleep
upon a more stable, and faithful Element. But
we made our way very slowly, and when we
cast up the Account of our Progress, found that
we had gone but <HI>little way in a long time;</HI> to∣wards
Evening we discovered another Island:
The first we saw was <HI>Mayork,</HI> the second,
<HI>Fromentere;</HI> and some of our Company that
had Sailed in these Seas, would undertake to as∣sure
us of it: We debated not long to which
of these we should direct our Course, for the
latter being much infested with venemous Ser∣pents,
and little, if at all Inhabited, we resol∣ved
all for <HI>Mayork:</HI> All that Night we Rowed
very hard, and the next, being the sixth of <HI>July,</HI>
and from our putting to Sea; we kept within
sight of it all Day, and about Ten a Clock at
Night we came under the Island, but the Rocks
were there so craggy, and steep, that we could
not climb up.</P>
<P>Whilst we were under these Rocks there
came a Vessel, very near us. Let the Reader put
himself in our stead, let him but Copy out our
Thoughts, let him imagine how loth we were
to lose all our toil and Travel, to forego our De∣liverance,
to have this Rich Mercy, which God
had put into our Hands, wrested out of them
again by some <HI>Turkish</HI> Pickaroon, or <HI>Corsair,</HI>
that are alwayes skimming those Seas: It con∣cerned
us therefore to lye close, and when they
<PB N="78" REF="59"/>
were passed by, we gently crept along the Coast
as near the shoar as we durst, till we found a
convenient place, where we might thrust in our
Weather-beaten Boat.</P>
<P>If these Papers should fall into the hands of
some that are great Clerks in the Art of Naviga∣tion,
and have conn'd the Mariners Terms of
Art, they will smile at my improper wording of
these Maters, and say, I am one of <HI>Paul's</HI> Ma∣riners.
But I can be content to be Accounted
one of his Mariners, whilst I have shared in his
Mercies: How many of those that spake the
Language of the Sea, yet have found her Bil∣lows
deaf to their Cries and Prayers, and their
stately Ships made the Scorn of Winds, and the
Reproach of Waves, when we, who had none
of their Ships, and little of their skill, have had
Experience of those Providences, to which rhey
have been Strangers.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The great kindness we received at Mayork
from the Vice-Roy, and the Inhabitants
of that Island and City.</HEAD>
<P>WHen we were come to Land, we were
not unsensible of our Deliverance,
though like Men newly awakened out of a
Dream, we had not the true Dimensions of it;
We confessed God had done <HI>great things</HI> for us,
but <HI>how great</HI> things he had done was beyond
our Comprehension: We had <HI>escaped the Sea,</HI>
but yet Death might be found <HI>at Land;</HI> and we
were ready to say, with <HI>Sampson,</HI> Judg. 15. 18.
<HI>Lord, thou hast given this great Deliverance
into the hands of thy Servants, and now shall we
dye for Thirst?</HI> We had had no Food since we
eat the Liver, and drank the Blood of the Tor∣toise,
and therefore leaving three of our Com∣pany
with the Boat, the other too, <HI>viz. John
Anthony,</HI> and my self were sent out to scout
abroad for fresh Water: And the rather were
we sent, because this <HI>John Anthony</HI> could speak
both the <HI>Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Tongues very
perfectly; and I had as much of the <HI>Spanish</HI> as
might serve to express our wants, and desires,
if perhaps we might meet with any persons there
<PB N="80" REF="60"/>
abouts. We were not far gone, before we fell
into a Wood, and we were in a Wilderness in
our thoughts, which way to take: He will needs
go his way, and I mine. Good Lord! what a
frail impotent thing is Man! That they whom
common dangers <HI>by Sea,</HI> common Deliverances
<HI>from Sea</HI> had United, should now about our
own wills fall out at Land. And yet thus we
did: He gave me reproachful words, and it's
well we came not to blows: But I went my own
way, and he seeing me resolute, <HI>followed me,</HI>
and the Providence of God, not dealing with us
according to our frowardness, <HI>followed us both:</HI>
This way led us to a Watch-Tower of the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
many of which they keep upon the Sea-Coasts,
to give the Countrey timely notice of
any Pickaroons that come ashoar to Rob, and
Spoyl.</P>
<P>When we came within call, fearing he might
Discharge at us, we spoke to him upon the
Watch, told him our Condition, what we
were, whence we came, how we escaped; and
earnestly begged of him to direct us to some fresh
Water, and in the mean time to bestow upon us
some Bread. He very kindly threw us down
<HI>an old mouldy Cake,</HI> but so long as it was <HI>a Cake,</HI>
and not <HI>a stone,</HI> nor <HI>a Bullet,</HI> Hunger did not
consider it's <HI>Mouldiness:</HI> Then he directed us
to fresh Water, which was hard by? We stood
not telling Stories; we remembred <HI>our selves,</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="60"/>
we remembred <HI>our Brethren</HI> left with our Boat,
and observing the Sentinels Directions, came
to a Well, where there was a Pot with strings
to draw with: We drank a little Water, and
eat a bit of our Cake, but the passage was so
dis-used, that we had much ado to force our
Throats to relieve our clamourous stomachs:
But here we staid not, but, with the four Le∣pers
in the Tents of the <HI>Syrians,</HI> 2 Kings 7. 9.
Rebuked our selves, <HI>We do not well, we have
glad Tidings to carry, and do we hold our peace?</HI>
We return to our Boat, are welcomed by our
Companions, acquaint them with the good suc∣cess
of our Embassy, and all prepare to make
to the Well.</P>
<P>And now <HI>we must leave our Boat;</HI> that <HI>faith∣ful
Instrument</HI> of God's Providence, which had
<HI>so trustily served his purpose</HI> to deliver us: It was
not without some recoylings upon our Spirits,
that we should so much as in appearance <HI>imitate
the ingratitude</HI> of those, who having served their
private ends on their Friends, and have now no
further use of them, most ungratefully shake
them off: That we should be like <HI>the water-dog,</HI>
which uses the water to pursue his Game; and
when he comes to Land, shakes it off as <HI>trouble∣some,
and burdensome.</HI> But it was no time to
stand upon Complements; Hunger, Thirst,
Weariness, desire of Refreshment and Rest▪
those <HI>importunate Duns,</HI> Commanded us away;
<PB N="82" REF="61"/>
and tying our Boat as fast as we could to the
Shoar, we left her <HI>to Mercy,</HI> which had been <HI>so
good</HI> to us.</P>
<P>As we were going, or rather creeping, or
crawling towards the Well, another Quarrel
started amongst us, the Memory whereof is
so ungrateful, that I shall give it a Burial in si∣lence,
the best <HI>Tomb for Controversies.</HI></P>
<P>And now we are at <HI>the Well,</HI> and the Well is
<HI>provided of Water,</HI> and we have <HI>something to
draw;</HI> all <HI>these helps</HI> God has given us, but he
must give us <HI>one more,</HI> even <HI>a throat to swallow</HI>
it, without which, all the rest <HI>signifie nothing.</HI>
This was the evil Disease <HI>Solomon</HI> had observed
in his Daies, <HI>Eccles. 6. 2. A Man to whom
God had given Riches, Wealth, and Honour,
so that he wanteth nothing for his Soul, of all
that he desireth; yet God giveth him not Power
to eat thereof:</HI> He that gives us <HI>water to drink,
and meat to eat,</HI> must give us <HI>Power to eat and
drink</HI> also. How totally do we depend upon
him for Life, and Breath, and all things! One
of our Company, <HI>William Adams,</HI> attempting
to drink, after many Essays was not able to swal∣low
it, but still the water returned, so that he
sunk down to the Ground, faintly saying, <HI>I am
a dead Man?</HI> we <HI>forgot</HI> our selves, to <HI>remember
him,</HI> and after much striving, and forcing, he
took a little; and when he and we were refresh'd
<PB N="83" REF="61"/>
with our Cake and water, we lay down by the
Well-side till the Morning. None of us could
<HI>watch for the rest,</HI> but <HI>One God watched over us
all:</HI> There we lay lockt up, and buried in
Sleep: The Heavens covered us, when we wan∣ted
a Canopy: Each might say in the Morning,
with <HI>David, Psal. 3. 5. I laid me down and slept;
I awaked, for the Lord sustained me.</HI></P>
<P>When it was clear day, we addrest our selves
once more to the man upon the watch-Tower,
entreating him to direct us the ready way to
the next House, or Town, where we might find
relief. He civily points us towards a House a∣bout
two Miles off, whither, with wearied steps,
and joyful Hearts, we now began to Travel:
Our Feet had been so <HI>parboyled, and quodled</HI> with
the <HI>Suns heat,</HI> in the <HI>Salt-water pickle,</HI> that
they were very raw, and more blister'd; and
long it was before we could overcome the te∣diousness
of those two Miles. When we ap∣proach'd
the House, the Owner espying us, and
concluding by our <HI>shabby garb,</HI> that we were
some <HI>Pilfering Rascals,</HI> presented a Fowling
Piece at us, and chatged us to stand. The fore∣most
of our Company, who could speak that
Language well, meekly told him, he might
spare that Language, we were <HI>not able</HI> if we
had so <HI>wicked a will;</HI> nor <HI>willing</HI> if we had been
<HI>able,</HI> to offer him the least injury; That we
were a Company of poor Creatures, whom the
wonderful Providence of God had rescued from
<PB N="84" REF="62"/>
he Slavery of <HI>Algiers,</HI> and hoped he would
shew Mercy to the Afflicted. The honest Far∣mer,
moved with our Relation, sent us out
Bread, Water, and Olives, with which when
we had refresh'd our selves, we lay down, and
rested three or four hours in the Field; and re∣turning
thanks for his Charity, prepared to crawl
away at our lame rate. He seeing us thankful
Beggers, enlarged his Civility to us, called us
into his House, and gave us good warm Bean
Pottage, which seemed to me the most Pleasant
Food that ever I eat in my Life: Our Leave
once more taken, we advanced towards the Ci∣ty
of <HI>Mayork,</HI> which from this place is about ten
Miles: No water could we meet with upon our
way, but towards Evening, we discoverd one
drawing water at a Well, we hasted to him,
and he drew for us; that was our Supper, and
there was our Lodging that Night.</P>
<P>The next Morning we came iuto the Suburbs
of the City, the strangeness of our Attire, being
bare-foot, bare-legg'd, having nothing on but
loose Coats over our Shirts; drew a croud of en∣quirers
about us, who we were? whence we
came? whither we went? We gave them a
particular account of our Deliverance, with its
Circumstances; and they as willing <HI>to pity,</HI> as
<HI>to know</HI> our Estate, and as ready <HI>to Relieve,</HI> as
<HI>pity,</HI> accommodated us for the present with food;
they gave us Wine, and Strong-waters, and
whatever else might recover our exhausted Spi∣rits;
<PB N="85" REF="62"/>
but told us, we must be obliged to tarry
in the Suburbs, till <HI>the Vice-Roy</HI> had notice that
such strangers were Arrived: He had soon <HI>In∣formation</HI>
of us, and we as soon <HI>a Command</HI> to
appear before him: He Examined us about ma∣ny
Affairs; what Men of War the <HI>Algerines</HI>
had at Sea? what strength they were of at
Land? But above all, he was most curious, and
exact in satisfying himself about our Escape, our
Boat, our hazzards at Sea, wherein when we
had fully obeyed him, he ordered we should
be maintained at his own Cost till we could have
passage to our own Country.</P>
<P>In this while the People gathered us Money
to buy us Clothes and Shooes, and we wanted
nothing that Nature called for, but <HI>thankful
Hearts to God.</HI> And they endeavoured to help
to <HI>that Mercy</HI> too: As I was walking in the
Streets viewing the City, a young Man-steps to
me, Friend (said he) are you one of those that
came lately over in the Canvas Boat? I An∣swered
Yes, I was one of them: well (reply∣ed
the young Man) <HI>It was not the little Boat,
but the great God that brought you Over.</HI> I must
needs say, I often think on this young man's
words, and as often as I think on them they
chide me, that I have not hitherto more pub∣lickly
owned God in his Gracious and wonder∣ful
Deliverance. However others may be con∣cern'd
to read, I know not, yet I am concern'd to
Write of the great things God has done for me.</P>

<HEAD>A Further Narrative of James
Deane and others.</HEAD>
<P>THe Methods of Gods Providence are <HI>Va∣rious,</HI>
yet all equally fraight with, and guid∣ed
with adorable Wisdom, Justice, and goodness
towards the Children of Men; sometimes by His
Blessing Hee is pleased to Crown <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>un∣likely</HI>
means with strange and Amazing success:
At other times to Blast <HI>Hopefull</HI> projects, and di∣vert
or overthrow <HI>promising</HI> designs when they
seem full ripe for Execution. By the <HI>one</HI> Hee en∣courages
our <HI>Faith</HI> in Himself; by the other,
corrects our <HI>presumption</HI> on our own Inventions,
and by <HI>Both,</HI> Glorifies his own Omnipotency,
Teaching us, That in and by Him we can do
<HI>all things,</HI> but <HI>without</HI> Him, Nothing.</P>
<P>The foregoing Narrative of a Stupendious
Deliverance, is a signal Instance of the <HI>First.</HI>
And that which is here subjoin'd (referring in
diverse Respects to the like Subject, tho failing
in an equal Success) may serve as an Example
of the second. And tho' our Relation abound
not in such Varieties of Wonder, yet may the
same be of some Satisfaction and Use to the
Reader, as well for acquainting him with the
Miseries poor Christians endure under the Ty∣ranny
<PB N="87" REF="65"/>
of cruel <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> thereby to awa∣ken
his <HI>Compassion,</HI> as also to raise his pious
thoughts to an Adoration of the Divine power
and Wisdom, so Visibly, tho <HI>Differently</HI> mani∣fested,
in these <HI>two Cases,</HI> wherein as farr as
<HI>mans Eye</HI> could reach, the Contrivance the
Conduct, and probability, seemed <HI>Equal,</HI> or
rather to have excell'd in the <HI>latter,</HI> tho fru∣strated
of Effect.</P>
<P>On the 25. of <HI>June 1679.</HI> we Sailed from
<HI>Bristol</HI> in a Vessel called <HI>the Robert and Hester,</HI>
Captain <HI>William Stoakes</HI> Commander, bound
for <HI>Barbado's. Those that go down to the Sea in
Ships behold the Wonders of the Lord in the deep,</HI>
says the Royal Psalmist; And I could wish that
all such would lay <HI>those Wonders</HI> more to heart,
so as better to Improve their <HI>Lives:</HI> To Con∣sider,
that they are every minute within a few
Inches of certain <HI>Death,</HI> nothing but a <HI>poor plank</HI>
(the daily Embl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of their <HI>Coffin)</HI> between
them and a <HI>watry Grave;</HI> That every hour they
are subject to <HI>Storms</HI> and <HI>Tempests,</HI> ready to
become a prey between the fury of contending
<HI>Winds</HI> and <HI>Waves;</HI> besides the hazard of Ene∣mies
and <HI>Pyrates,</HI> and a Thousand other Ca∣sualties,
all which were enough one would think
to keep them in the most sober frame, an Holy
Conversation and strict Dependence on that
<HI>all-sufficient</HI> Power, who <HI>alone can protect</HI> them
from so many immediate and <HI>Round-threatning</HI>
Dangers; But so incorrigibly hard and wicked
<PB N="88" REF="66"/>
is the Heart of Man, that we find too many un∣der
the prospect of all these Wonders and Pe∣rils
utterly insensible; Mariners that fill their
<HI>Sails</HI> with the Breath of <HI>Cursing</HI> and <HI>Blasphemies,</HI>
and encrease the raging of the <HI>Sea</HI> with the
<HI>Vomits</HI> of their <HI>Surfeiting</HI> and <HI>Drunkenness;</HI> And
what can such expect but <HI>swift Destruction,</HI> even
to be Swallowed up by an Ocean of <HI>Water,</HI> and
delivered over to a Deluge of everlasting <HI>Flames?</HI>
I speak this not as reflecting on our <HI>Ships Crew</HI> in
particular (wherein most were at least <HI>Civiliz'd</HI>
Persons) but for a General Caution; Nor yet
dare I excuse my self and our Company from
many <HI>neglects</HI> of our Duty, for which it appears
in the Sequel, God had <HI>a Controversie with us,</HI>
whose Justice always punishes us, that we should
<HI>not Sin,</HI> and never but <HI>for Sinning.</HI></P>
<P>After a week pleasant Sailing, on the 2d. of
<HI>July</HI> at Day light, we saw two Ships standing
towards us, and soon discovered them to be
<HI>Turkish</HI> Men of Warr, which put us into a great
and General Consternation, as knowing how
unprepared we were for resistance, both for our
small strength, and for that ours was a <HI>Pesterd
Ship</HI> by reason of a quantity of <HI>Hay</HI> we had on
Deck and elsewhere, for a dozen Horses we
carried with us; However we resolv'd to Sell
our Liberty at the best rate we could, and pre∣pared
to Entertain them; within an hour and
an half, one of them was came up along by our
side, and for the First Complement fired in his
<PB N="89" REF="66"/>
<HI>Broad-side</HI> and a lustly Volley of <HI>small Shott,</HI>
which shot off our <HI>Taller,</HI> and wounded us three
Men, but none mortally; Kild also one of our
Horses in the <HI>Hold,</HI> and having received two
Shots more between <HI>Wind and Water,</HI> we quick∣ly
had about 4 or 5 foot Water in the <HI>Hold:</HI> we
Answered them with our Guns, but to little
purpose; for having soon spent all the <HI>Powder</HI> we
had up out of our <HI>Powder-Room,</HI> and it being
Impossible for us at that instant to come at any
more; and at the same time perceiving the o∣ther
Ship almost with us, and that it was im∣possible
we should make good our Defence a∣gainst
2 of the <HI>best</HI> Ships of <HI>Algeirs</HI> (For they
proved to be the <HI>Golden Horse,</HI> old <HI>Canaria</HI>
Captain, and the other the <HI>Golden Rose,</HI> young
<HI>Canaria</HI> Captain,) we thought best to Com∣pound
for our <HI>Lives</HI> at the price of our <HI>Liberties,</HI>
and surrendred our Ship.</P>
<P>Hereupon their Boat came aboard and fetcht
us all away, except two whom they left aboard
with some of their Turks and Moors. When
we came on Board the Turks man of Warr, the
Captain by an Interpreter inquired our Lading,
and with many menaces exacted a full Account
to the best of our knowledge, soon after they
took 2 Ships more, and ere they went off our
Coast, they surpriz'd in all 9 Ships, wherein
were about 170 Souls. And having taken the
men out, and pillag'd their pleasure; some of
the Ships they <HI>Burnt,</HI> and others <HI>Sunk,</HI> having
<PB N="90" REF="67"/>
not Men enough to spare to Man so many, but
three of the best they sent away home; And
having now been out of the <HI>Straights</HI> near six
Weeks, they are afraid to venture in without
<HI>clearing</HI> their Ships, and therefore went on the
South Coast of Barbary to <HI>Magadore,</HI> touching
also at <HI>Saphe</HI> and other Towns to take in fresh
Provisions;</P>
<P>All this time we poor Captive Christians were
put every night in <HI>Irons.</HI> The manner whereof
was thus, between 2 spare <HI>Top-Masts</HI> between
the Decks placed about 6 asunder, we sat close
to one another on each side, and in the middle
went a long <HI>Iron Bolt</HI> between our Shackles, so
that we were constrained to sleep sitting (when
the necessitie of Nature could Charm our per∣plexed
Spirits into any kind of Repose;) not
being afforded Room to <HI>lye down;</HI> And the
weather being extream <HI>hot,</HI> and the place
close and <HI>Sultry,</HI> we were forced to sit naked;
The Provisions alotted to keep us alive, (who
now began rather to Court and wish for <HI>Death)</HI>
was only a small pittance of Bread, and some
Vinegar, with a few drops of Oyl, and this was
all our Allowance for 24 Hours; and that
which yet added more to our misery was, that
they afforded us not much above <HI>a pint</HI> of Wa∣ter
a Day, so that thro' very extremit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Thirst,</HI>
we were frequently forc'd to beg and intreat
of the Moors boys, to bring us salt Water, and
could but <HI>seldome</HI> obtain that favour of them
<PB N="91" REF="67"/>
neither; Nay when we were in <HI>Magadore,</HI> tho
we could (like Tantalus for our greater Tor∣ture)
see the <HI>Fresh-Water</HI> plentifully on the
shore, and were almost Dead with Drought,
in working and continual heaving in of <HI>Ballast,</HI>
yet we could not be allow'd but about 3 pints
for four and twenty Hours, and half of that
too, <HI>Salt</HI> or brackish; whereby we became so
faint that we could hardly stand on our Legs;
but it was vain to Intreat or expect any other
usage from those whose tenderest <HI>Mercies</HI> were
the Extremities of <HI>Cruelly,</HI> unless we would have
abandon'd all fear of God, and respect to <HI>mo∣desty</HI>
and the Dignity of Humane Nature, by
Condescending to the detestable sollicitations of
their most unnatural Lusts, to which they were
not wanting in their cursed Importunities; so
that our very <HI>Souls</HI> were not free from their
Tortures; They being so filthy as to mix with
<HI>Brute Beast,</HI> having seen such Evidences of their
abominations in that kind, with some Crea∣tures
that were on Board, as fill'd our Hearts
with horror, and are not fit to be named a∣mongst
Christians: At length the Wind stand∣ing
fair, they resolv'd to Sail Homewards; but
first must perform their <HI>Orisons;</HI> (for these
<HI>Filthy-Infidels</HI> at to the outward <HI>Ceremonies</HI> and
observances of their wicked Religion are Extra∣ordinary
<HI>Punctual;)</HI> Therefore for a <HI>Peace-Offering</HI>
to the Sea, (or whether it were to <HI>Ma∣homet,</HI>
to send them an Happy passage, I know
<PB N="92" REF="68"/>
not, they offered their Sacrifice of a <HI>Sheep,</HI>
having first cut in the midst, one half they heav∣ed
<HI>Over-Board</HI> on the one side, the other on the
other; with certain Muttering Prayers which
we understood not; This fit of Devotion be∣ing
past, they make all the Sail they could, and
in they stand through the <HI>Streights-Mouth,</HI> and
in two or three days Arrived at their <HI>Desired</HI>
Port;</P>
<P>Nor was it <HI>undesired</HI> by us: For as we long'd
to know the worst of our Condition, so we flat∣tered
our selves that it must needs be better than
that on Board, at least that there we should have
<HI>Water</HI> enough, the Want of which here was in∣tollerable.</P>
<P>Being brought ashore we were sent to the <HI>Ar∣midore</HI>'s
House, and the next day carried to
the Pallace of the <HI>Dey,</HI> Bashaw, or King, who
by his Prerogative out of every Eight Slaves
brought in, Chuses <HI>one,</HI> and commonly elects
the Captains, as supposing they are able to pro∣cure
the <HI>best Ransome,</HI> or if there happen to be
taken any young Lady of <HI>Extraordinary Beauty</HI>
or Youth, well Featur'd, and of a promising
Aspect, these he snaps, and sends away as most
<HI>Acceptable Presents</HI> to the <HI>Grand Seignior;</HI> for
whom there is never any Redemption. The
next day about eight of us were carried into the
Market, and one or two of the Kings <HI>Slaves</HI>
with us, where about one a Clock we were led
about the Market, <HI>one by one</HI> by a <HI>Negro,</HI> who
<PB N="93" REF="68"/>
in the Turkish Language cryed out as he went,
to this effect—<HI>Here is a brave Captain, a Mate,
a Merchant,</HI> &amp;c. (as the Person is quallified)
<HI>one has bid so much, who bids more?</HI> And when
they have been the Market round, and none will
give more, then they put him by; And so pro∣ceed
till all are sold. And then they have us to
the <HI>Kings House</HI> again, and if He or any else
there, will give more but to the value of a shil∣ling
then was bid in the Market, he shall have
the Slave; otherwise the Market Chapman
takes him, and he is thenceforth absolutely
<HI>His,</HI></P>
<P>It was my hard fortune to be sold to a <HI>Taga∣reen</HI>
(or Moor, whose Ancestors formerly came
out of <HI>Spain,</HI> and ever since assume the Title of
that City from whence they were driven) but
his Name was <HI>Haly Hammet Ben Jejilee,</HI> and
for his Temper it was well known, for as I came
out with him from the Kings House, several told
me I had got <HI>a Cursed Patroon.</HI></P>
<P>But I was now in, <HI>for better for worse,</HI> and fol∣lowed
him very obsequiously to his House, where
after a day or two, I with others of his Slaves
(whereof several were English) were set to ga∣ther
dung out of a <HI>Fondack,</HI> as they call it,
being the place where Horses, Asses, Mules, and
Cows and other Cattel, sometimes to the num∣ber
of 100 or more were kept, and also the place
of Slaughter, where they killed Beasts as oft as
they had occasion, whose <HI>Blood</HI> mixt with their
<PB N="94" REF="69"/>
<HI>Dung</HI> in that hot Climate, made it very noisome
and offensive; but we must not be <HI>Dainty-No∣sed,</HI>
but rake it up into Baskets, and carry it out
on our <HI>Heads</HI> or Shoulders, to a <HI>Dunghil</HI> at a
great distance.</P>
<P>This Jobb being finisht, we were put to work
in the <HI>Mould,</HI> abord Prizes, for sometime, and
after that sent to the <HI>Garden</HI> or <HI>Vineyard</HI> (for
it was both) about four miles from the Town,
where instead of digging with a <HI>Spade,</HI> we had
only a <HI>Chopp</HI> of 8. or <HI>10l.</HI> weight which we
were forced to work vvith at <HI>Arms-end,</HI> and I
think vvas as hard Labour as any could be,
unless grinding at their <HI>Silk-Mills;</HI> and if vve
<HI>Loitered,</HI> or they vvere pleased to think vve did
so, presently vve had many blovvs on the back,
and sides, and sometimes on the <HI>Soles</HI> of the
feet, and our hair torn off our heads, with other
inexpressible Cruelties, whilst in the mean time,
we had many times but one <HI>poor Cake</HI> of <HI>Course
Bread</HI> allowed us <HI>per</HI> day for our diet, and our
Lodging at night most hard and miserable, for
frequently when we were in the City, we were
driven into a <HI>Nasty Cellar,</HI> where was an House
of Office that stank intollerably; and the room
so small, that there being near twenty of us,
it would not afford breadth or length enough
for us to <HI>Ly<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Down,</HI> but there were some Bords
put up and a Platoon made about thre foot from
the Ground, where some lay a top, and the rest
under neath.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="69"/>
Thus for many long moneths we continued
as miserable, as to this World, as 'twas possible
for the Envy and Cruelty of our Patroon to
make us. You need not doubt but we had often
thoughts of making our <HI>Escape,</HI> but the manner
how to do it, seemed next to impossible; yet as
<HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cessity</HI> is the <HI>Mother of Invention,</HI> variety of ways
were proposed, some that were men of <HI>Courage</HI>
heated by these Cruelties to a degree of▪ <HI>Despera∣tion,</HI>
were for taking a Boat from the Mould at
Noon-day, &amp; going away maugre all their Force,
and defying them to Catch us, but this was lookt
upon as extravagant, others had other projects;
and no sooner was any thing offered, but it was
disliked, for indeed all were attended with <HI>insu∣perable
Difficulties,</HI> and yet so greedy were we
of <HI>Liberty,</HI> that we would <HI>Catch</HI> at any thing
that seemed to promise us that happiness, and
somewhat eased our present miseries by those
pleasing thoughts and Idaeas; which yet our
recollected Reason told us were <HI>vain</HI> and impra∣cticable.</P>
<P>At length one of my Fellow-Slaves told me
of a design that He and some others had of get∣ting
away, which he verily believed might be
<HI>feazible,</HI> and after he had sworn me to Secresy,
acquainted me, That it was by building a Boat
privately, but that they wanted strength, and
an Artificer for the Work; which I undertook
to procure; The Names of us Concerned in
his Project were <HI>William Johnson,</HI> Captain <HI>Pe∣ter
<PB N="96" REF="70"/>
Palmer,</HI> Doctor <HI>John Atwood,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI>
Captain <HI>Thomas Cheiney, William Knight</HI> of
<HI>Bristol, Henry Bull, William Phelps, Arnold
Showel</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> Captain, Another a Carpen∣ter,
whose name I know not, though I brought
him into the design; Three Spaniards, a <HI>Portu∣guez
Negro,</HI> who were with us in the Garden,
and my self.</P>
<P>Matters being thus resolved on, we applyed
our selves to getting of Thyme, some of which
we furnisht our selves with, out of our <HI>own</HI>
and the rest from other Folks Gardens, in the
Night (wherein if we had been Caught, we should
have had Three or 400 Bastinadoes for Break∣fast)
and it was almost a miracle, how those
which lay in the Garden, <HI>viz. John Atwood</HI> and
the Spaniards, escaped it, the Moors lying very
thick up and down the Hedges; but at last af∣ter
much time, hazard and industry, we had
formed our <HI>Keel,</HI> which vvas twenty foot long,
six foot broad and three foot deep, and our
Timbers fitted to their places, with holes rea∣dy
bored, that there should not want much
knocking, when vve should set her up <HI>for good
and all;</HI> we had likewise got <HI>Canes</HI> to make fast
with <HI>Rope-yarns</HI> from Timber to Timber, as
also, <HI>Pitch, Tar, Tallow,</HI> and other requisites,
For providing of which; you must know, that
some of us had saved privately, some small par∣cels
of money, and others being suffered to
work at their own hand, and follovv Trades,
<PB N="97" REF="70"/>
paying their <HI>Patroons</HI> so much a Month, got
Money, which they expended freely on this
occasion▪ But the great difficulty was to get the
<HI>dressed Hides</HI> wherewith we intended to cover
our Boat, and to help us therein we were be∣holding
to Mr. <HI>Showel,</HI> who since his Slavery,
upon I know not what former insight into that
Mystery, had set up for a <HI>Cobler,</HI> and lived
from his <HI>Patroon</HI> under Contribution; and by
that means had the Opportunity to buy them,
which were privately convey'd into those things
in which we carried Dung on the <HI>Mules,</HI> and
so got out of the Tovvn, and so sovved up,
vvhich vvas most artificially performed by Mr.
<HI>Showel</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bull,</HI> and the Boats covering
most conveniently prepared, and all things
hid in parcells near the Sea-side ready for the
Voyage.</P>
<P>Hitherto things going on thus fairly, and
every one of our <HI>Cabal</HI> expecting no less than
Liberty, the very day appointed for our going
away at Evening being come, and having pro∣vided
Bread and Water and other Necessaries
for that purpose. It happen'd our <HI>Patroon</HI> him∣self,
who had not been in the Garden for some∣time,
did, by I know not what ill-Fortune,
or rather as to me <HI>good Providence,</HI> come into
the Garden, of whose approach a Spaniard set
for <HI>a Spye,</HI> gave them notice, so that they had
time enough <HI>to hide</HI> their things which they
were preparing that night to set together, but
<PB N="98" REF="71"/>
some of them being found rambling, were strict∣ly
Examined, and when come home severely
Beaten upon <HI>Suspition,</HI> but they stood it out
stiffly, and never Impeached any.</P>
<P>In the mean time I was gone to call some more
of our Company, and at my return received
tidings from the <HI>Spaniard</HI> how Cases stood▪
whereupon we consulted, whether it were best
to go on presently, or deferr it for some time,
and it was carried for waiting another Oppor∣tunity;
which whilst we were expecting, ano∣ther
Accident put us to stand, which was thus,
Some of our Timbers being bound together, and
put into the next Garden by Consent of a Spa∣niard,
vvho of Necessity must be made privy to
the Design, his <HI>Patroon</HI> happen'd to light up∣on
them so out to pieces, and violently be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
his Slave, but by good luck this old Fellovv and
our <HI>Patroon</HI> vvere not Friends, and so the bu∣siness
never came to his Ear.</P>
<P>Therefore this Disappointment of the loss
of our Timber did not vvholly discourage, but
got others and framed them, and had brought
all things again to perfection, vvhen once more
our project vvas Interrupted, and by other
hands and in an untimely manner put in Exe∣cution.</P>
<P>For about the latter end of <HI>November 1681</HI>
there came from other Gardens 2 Dutchmen▪
a Spaniard and some others; Who, by I can∣not
guess, what means, being acquainted with
<PB N="99" REF="71"/>
our Designs, and the forwardness we were in,
they Ingratiated themselves with the Spaniards
that lay in our Garden, and agree with them
forthwith to make use of this Expedient for
their Escape, And thereupon they threaten
<HI>John Atwood,</HI> who also lay there, that if He
would not Consent and go with them, they
would forthwith Kill him to prevent his ma∣king
a Discovery.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> was loth to abandon his
Friends, and Rob them of that means which
they so long and with such Danger and Charge
had been Contriving to leave them behind, and
Embarque himself with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as were for the
most part Strangers; yet dread of Death and
Hopes of <HI>Liberty</HI> prevailed with him to Comply;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> under pretence of some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 
another <HI>Garden</HI> where was an Englishman privy
to the Intrigue and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was and
that the <HI>Carpenter</HI> was at Work <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
resolved to be going by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Clock▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
poor Mans Patroon being in the Garden, he
could not come till Fight, and finding then
gone runs to the <HI>Sea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>side,</HI> and in his hast set
several <HI>Doggs</HI> a Barking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sup∣posed
they fearing some might be in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of
them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a
Jarr of <HI>Water,</HI> some <HI>Figs,</HI> some <HI>Bread,</HI> and a
<HI>Blank<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> behind them; and so the before men∣tioned
Englishman lamenting the loss of this
Opportunity, returned to his Garden undis∣covered.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="72"/>
Next morning 'twas my lot vvith one of my
Fellovv Slaves to be sent into the Garden, but
finding no body there, and quickly perceiving
other Symptomes, I concluded they vvere gone▪
But Oh! hovv much <HI>anger</HI> did I svvell vvith
against them for leaving me behind, (for as yet
I understood not the Truth, tho aftervvards I
did, from the before-mentioned English-man
that came too late,) and vvhat an Excess of
Grief and sorrovv did possess me for not going
vvith them; vvhen yet this very thing which
I so much fretted my self about, was to me the
the most <HI>eminent Mercy</HI> of Providence; for those
that went off, were <HI>never any of them heard of,</HI>
so that 'tis Justly supposed they were <HI>all lost</HI>
and cast away: And as for me that vvas left
behind, vvithin six vveeks after, my <HI>Ransome-Money</HI>
came from <HI>England,</HI> being 400 pieces of
Eight, besides 218 for Charges, and so I safely
returned to my Native Countrey; For vvhich
Gratious Providence of God, as I hope I shall
never forget to return him continual thanks
from the Centre of my Soul, so I thought it no
less than my Duty to give this Publique Testi∣mony
of my Gratitude to that Divine and A∣dorable
Power to whom be all praise, Glory,
and Honour both now and for Ever-more.</P>
