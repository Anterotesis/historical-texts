<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHen I had the ho∣nour
to attend
your Lordship in
your Embassy to the <HI>States</HI> of
<HI>Venice,</HI> it was my fortune
<PB REF="5"/>
there to meet with a small Piece,
entituled <HI>Viaggio Pittoresco
d'Italia,</HI> the Task being of no
very great difficulty, and alto∣gether
agreeable to my own in∣clination,
I have gratified my
self; and I hope not disobliged
ingenious Artists in a faithful
rendition of it into <HI>English;</HI>
which I have done the rather
because the Book is rarely to
be found in <HI>Italy,</HI> and I can∣not
remember I have seen any
<HI>Original</HI> in <HI>England</HI> but that
which is in my own hands. I
<PB REF="5"/>
have taken courage to prefix
your Lordships honourable name
to this Translation to render it
acceptable to the world, under
the Patronage of an acurate
Judge, and a zealous lover
and encourager of the noble <HI>Art</HI>
of <HI>Painting.</HI> If it may serve
to put your Lordship in mind of
the pleasure you received by a
personal view and admiration
of those great <HI>Masters</HI> elaborate
Pieces when your Lordship
was abroad; and in any mea∣sure
testifie my desires to serve
<PB REF="6"/>
your Lordship, 'tis the greatest
Honour and satisfaction can be
wished for, or is attainable by,</P>

<HEAD>To the ingenious
READERS.</HEAD>
<P>HAving, not many years since,
given my self the satisfaction
of personally viewing the most prin∣cipal
Places and Rarities of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and other the beautiful Cities of <HI>Ita∣ly;</HI>
I thought my self obliged to make
my Countreymen some accompt
of my Observations, those especi∣ally
who are lovers of the Noble
<HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Painting;</HI> if not to assure our
young Nobility and Gentry that 'tis
worth their while, and curiosity to
Travel; yet at least to inflame their
minds, and excite their industry, to
<PB REF="7"/>
imitate those great <HI>Masters</HI> whose
Employment made their Lives easie,
their Persons Venerable, and their
Names Immortal: On these conside∣rations
I had attempted, my self,
a <HI>Collection</HI> of what I had seen, but
for want of opportunities, and ad∣mission
into several Places of re∣mark,
I was about to have desisted
from that Design, which I foresaw
was like to be but very imperfect:
At last, lighting upon the ensuing
<HI>Treatise,</HI> I found the work criti∣cally
done to my hand; wherein
there is a faithful accompt of the
Names and Performances of most
of the greatest <HI>Masters,</HI> as well An∣tient
as Modern, whose curious and
elaborate <HI>Pieces</HI> are at this day the
fairest Ornament, and Pride, o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
all the places of Devotion, Pleasure▪
and Magnificence throughout all
<HI>Italy.</HI> The Author <HI>Giacomo Barr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB REF="7"/>
was a <HI>Venetian Painter</HI> of good e∣steem,
and had the good hap to please
his Countreymen by letting them
know in this Book what Treasures
they were Masters of: and I dare
hope this my Translation (mean as
it is) has not rendred it altogether
unacceptable at home, to those at
least who have any passion for an <HI>Art</HI>
so worthily esteemed by the most In∣genious
Spirits of all Ages. I have
added onely two things of my own
to this work, One is a view of <HI>Sig∣nior
Septale's</HI> Closet in <HI>Milan,</HI> not
inferiour to any of the <HI>Italian Princes</HI>
Collections (inaccessible it seems to
our Author;) The other a few <HI>Heads</HI>
of some of the most renowned <HI>Masters.</HI>
I shall compass the ends of all my
Travels and pains, if my Countrey∣men,
by these my endeavours, may
take encouragement to emulate what
they see there so highly valued and
<PB REF="8"/>
admired; and undoubtedly the
<HI>English</HI> Genius is as capable of
arriving at the highest pitch of Per∣fection
and Glory in <HI>This</HI> and all o∣ther
Liberal Sciences, as that of old
<HI>Athens,</HI> or of modern <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
