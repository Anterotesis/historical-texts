<HEAD>THE
Author's Preface.</HEAD>
<P>IF I had taken the leasure to make a
serious Reflection on the boldness of
my design, I had not publisht this Ac∣count
of my Voyages; the raw Age in
which I made them, had been a sufficient
reason to discourage me from it, besides
the consideration of the polite Age we
live in. For tho' I have followed Truth
with the greatest severity, yet these Re∣lations
want perhaps those other Advan∣tages
that are apt to recommend things
of this nature to the Reader, such as Air
and Stile in the writing of them, so much
valued at present.</P>
<P>Yet however devoid of these Ornaments,
I shall venture to present them to the
Publick, after so ingenious an acknowledg∣ment,
in hopes the young Traveller will
meet with a mild and easy censure of his
first attempts, while he gives the Publick
a most exact account of the particulars of
Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI>'s Voyage and Under∣takings
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> which has been so
earnestly and impatiently expected; of his
<PB REF="3"/>
Engagements with the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch;</HI>
with the Advantages he has gain'd of them;
and his Conduct in bringing back a Squa∣dron
safe with which his Majesty entru∣sted
him, through a Voyage of six Thousand
Leagues, through Storms and Tempests, and
all the rage and power of the Enemy.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Reader will be pleas'd with
the variety of the Subject with which I
have furnisht this Relation, which can't
but render it the more agreable and en∣tertaining;
as likewise with some Re∣marks
curious enough, concerning the va∣rious
Nations and Countries thro' which
we past, and the horrible Tempest that sur∣priz'd
us in our return in the Latitude of
<HI>Mascarin.</HI> I have writ all in the natural
order in which they fell out, with exact∣ness
and fidelity, obliging my self to omit
nothing of moment, and to relate no∣thing
of which I was not an Eye-wit∣ness:
So after acquainting the Reader
before hand with some Repetitions, which
by a frequent recurring of the same things
were unavoidable, I have nothing more to
desire for his satisfaction, or my own ad∣vantage,
but that the stile had been more
polite and correct, there being nothing else
wanting to compleat his satisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Account of the Squadron designed
by <HI>France</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Enemies of <HI>France</HI> having
alarm'd all <HI>Europe</HI> for her De∣struction,
expected their Pro∣jects
would have equal suc∣cess
in these Parts of the World;
that the Commerce she had establish'd
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> would follow the Re∣volution
of <HI>Siam,</HI> and be intirely
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
ruin'd, as being too much employ'd
at home, in her own immediate De∣fence;
to be able to send any Forces
to those distant Parts of the World:
But the GOD of Armies having de∣feated
the Designs of so numerous
and Confederated an Enemy, has so
visibly extended his Holy protection
to the sacred Person of his Majesty
and his Dominions; that in spight of
all their utmost Efforts, he has been
the Agressor, and set on them first
and their Factories in those Parts; a
sufficient demonstration of the Glory
and Strength of <HI>France.</HI> To this En∣terprise
the King appointed six Ships;
which were the <HI>Bird,</HI> the <HI>Lyon,</HI> the
<HI>Dragon,</HI> the <HI>Jolly,</HI> the <HI>Prosperus,</HI> and
the <HI>Rock;</HI> the Three first of which
were fitted at <HI>Brest,</HI> the rest in the
Magazines of the <HI>East,</HI> at <HI>Port Lewis,</HI>
where the Squadron Rendevouz'd;
which being join'd the beginning of
<HI>February,</HI> (90,) the Equipages were di∣dributed
in this manner.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Duquesne,</HI> whom the Court
had made Commandant, pitch'd upon
the <HI>Jolly,</HI> mounted with Forty four
Guns, Two hundred and Fifty Men.
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
He had <HI>Messieurs</HI> the Commander of
<HI>Portere</HI> for Second Captain, <HI>D' Anber∣ville</HI>
for Lieutenant, <HI>de Voutron, Fauche,</HI>
and <HI>Baron,</HI> for Ensigns, with Ten
Guard-Marines.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>le Chealier d' Aire</HI> Com∣manded
the <HI>Bird,</HI> of 42 Guns and
Two hundred Men; <HI>Messieurs de la
Neufville</HI> was his Second Captain,
<HI>De la Villauclers,</HI> and <HI>Demons,</HI> his
Lieutenants.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Joyeuse</HI> went on Board the
<HI>Prosperus</HI> of 44 Guns, and Two hun∣dred
and Thirty Men; he had <HI>Messieurs
Granche,</HI> for Lieutenant, his Son and
<HI>de la Perine</HI> for Ensigns.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Hortin</HI> took the <HI>Rock,</HI> of
38 Guns, and 200 Men; <HI>Messieurs le
Chevalier de de Bouchetier,</HI> and <HI>le Vasseur</HI>
were his Lieutenants.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Chamoreau,</HI> Commanded
the <HI>Lyon,</HI> which is a Frigat of 24 Guns,
and a 180 Men; he had no other
Officers then Monsieur <HI>de Presac</HI> his
Lieutenant; Two <HI>Capuchins</HI> went aboard
him, who was bound for <HI>Surate.</HI></P>
<P>And Monsieur <HI>Quistly</HI> boarded the
<HI>Dragon,</HI> which is another Frigat of
28 Guns, 280 Men; Monsieur <HI>de
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Chenelon</HI> was his Lieutenant. Two
Companies of Foot with their Offiers,
were over and above distributed a
board these six Ships, and some Re∣ligious,
which the Papist Priest <HI>Ta∣chard</HI>
carried to the <HI>Indies;</HI> they came
aboard us with a Secretary, and Three
Mandarins of the late King of <HI>Siam.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Squadron Sails.</HEAD>
<P>THE Squadron thus Arm'd, had
not been Ten Days before the
Isle of <HI>Groge,</HI> when Orders came from
Court to Sail immediately. So <HI>Fri∣day</HI>
the 24th of <HI>February</HI> (90,) Monsieur
<HI>Duquesne</HI> coming aboard at Five in the
Evening, weighed Anchor, after
giving the parting Guns; we present∣ly
were under Sail, with the Wind at
<HI>North,</HI> and a delicate Gale as could
be wish'd, but it did not last long,
coming about at Ten next Morning;
so that we were obliged to put back
again; but by the 27th we Sailed a∣gain,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
the Wind being more favourable
than at first.</P>
<P>We made such way, that we soon
lost sight of Land, which we were
not like to see again in a good while:
The Wind contiued so favourable, that
by the Tenth of <HI>March</HI> we doubled
<HI>Cape Fenester:</HI> The Sea is commonly
Boysterous in this Latitude, and the
passage dangerous, and there's no
bearing much Sail here.</P>
<P>The Sixth Day became remarkable,
by an Accident that happen'd to us.
The Gabier, who is one appointed to
look to the Masts and Tackling, hang∣ing
on the Foremast Sail-yard, un∣hapily
fell into the Sea, which was
then very boisterous; we did all we
could to save him, threw out Ropes,
hoisted out the Boat, but all in vain,
for the Storm was so violent, that he
sunk presently.</P>
<P>Great are the terrors of this Ele∣ment,
and there is nothing apter to
make a Man serious, when he consi∣ders
there is but a Plank between him
and Eternity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The first discovery of Land, since we
lost sight of it, Remarks on the
Pike of <HI>Teneriffe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE Steer'd our Course for the
<HI>Madera</HI> Islands, where with
pleasure, we waited to take in some
refreshments, tho' 'twas not above
Nine Days that we had lost sight of
Land. But the Currents which we
met having carried us too far to the
<HI>East,</HI> or rather to the great Foggs at
Land, having hinder'd us from the
sight of it; we left it to the Right,
without perceiving it, till we had
doubled it. The 9th we discovered
the Isle of <HI>Savages,</HI> which was the
first Land we made since we parted
from <HI>Port-Lewis;</HI> 'tis scituated in 30
Degrees of the <HI>Northern</HI> Latitude, and
Twenty Minutes Longitude. This is
an uninhabited Island, very dangerous
for the Steep Craggy Rocks that in∣viron
it for above a League; that
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
scarce a Boat can go a Shoar; by this
sight of Land we judged we were
not far from the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands, which
doubtless we should have come to
sight of, the next Morning, if we had
not been delay'd by a Calm, which
happily lasted but a little while; for,
in the Evening it began to blow a brisk
Gale, so that by the Eleventh, at 7 a
Clock in the Morning, we were with∣in
Thirteen Lagues of the Pike of
<HI>Teneriffe.</HI></P>
<P>By Noon we were near it, being in
Twenty Eight Degrees, Thirty Six
Minutes, <HI>North</HI> Latitude, and Three
Hundred and Fifty Nine Degrees of
Longitude. The Pike of <HI>Teneriffe</HI> is
seen Forty Leagues off, and undoubt∣edly
may pass for one of the highest
Mountains in the World. Some make
it seven Leagues high, others Twelve.
This proud Mountain wraps its head
in the Clouds, which appears white,
by reason of the Snow that covers
it Winter and Summer, rising through
the middle Region of the Air, which
makes it so cold that none was ever
able to mount it.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Behind this Mountain stands the
Town of <HI>Canary,</HI> of which the Island
bears the Name; which is very Fruit∣ful,
and abounds in Corn, and is fa∣mous
for the rich Wines it produces,
which are carried to all Parts of the
World. Three are besides Three o∣ther
Islands; the first, that of <HI>Gomer,</HI>
of the same side with the Pike, and
not above Six or Seven Leagues distant.
The second is <HI>Palm</HI> Island, memorable
for the Death of Forty Jesuits, who
going to <HI>Brazill,</HI> to Preach the Faith
of Jesus Christ, were there Martyr'd
by the <HI>Calvinists,</HI> about a Hundred
Years ago. This latter is opposite to
the Pike of <HI>Teneriffe,</HI> and is about
Twelve or Thirteen Leagues distant.
We past between these two, having
<HI>Palme</HI> Island on the Right, and the
Pike of <HI>Teneriffe</HI> on the Left. And
the last is the Isle of <HI>Fer,</HI> where Geo∣graphers
commonly place the first
<HI>Meridian.</HI> These four Islands belong
to <HI>Spain,</HI> so that we could not take a
view of them, but at a distance, by
reason of the War between us and it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The different Opinions concerning the Trading Winds.</HEAD>
<P>THe Wind which had hardly stir'd
all day, began to blow fresh in
the Evening, so that we cou'd easily
perceive the Trading Winds, which are
so useful for Sailing; they are call'd
so by reason of their continuing three
or four months without changing. These
sort of Winds Blow always from the
North East in the Southern parts, and
from the South East in the Northern
parts, which very much perplexes cu∣rious
people to find out the true rea∣son
of it. Some maintain, that the
Trading Winds are no other then
those which blow from the West, and
the North with great violence, which
passing over <HI>Europe</HI> to the East and
South, rarify and grow weaker as
they approach the warmer Cli∣mates;
on the contrary, in the Sou∣thern
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
parts, the Western and Southern
Winds blowing with the same vio∣lence
towards <HI>Africa,</HI> are thence dri∣ven
towards the East and North, and
abate by degrees as they approach the
warmths of the Line, and quite cease
when they reach it.</P>
<P>Others explain this matter after a
different manner; they will have it,
that the excessive heats of the Line
draw these Winds from the Poles,
where the Exhalations and Vapors,
which are the matter of the Winds,
being stronger and in greater abun∣dance
cause more violent and lasting
ones, and that afterwards these Winds
or Exhalations are drawn towards the
Zone, and there abated by the exces∣sive
heat.</P>
<P>Behold the best Account I could
meet with, to satisfy those who are
curious in this matter; but whatever
the Natural Cause of them may be, it
may be truly said, they are the sweet∣est
Winds that blow.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Squadron Anchors at the Island
of <HI>Saintiague.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HEther we had reason to admire
our happiness, and to hope we
should soon arrive at <HI>Saintiague,</HI> where
we were to stay some days; our only
misery was a violent Fever which
feiz'd our men, and of which fifty lay
dangerously ill, tho' we had been but
three weeks at sea. 'Twas then the
<HI>R. R. F. F.</HI> the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> found an op∣portunity
to exercise their Zeal and
Charity; they <HI>Confest</HI> the sick, gave
them Instructions for dying well,
and assisted them with their own pro∣visions:
It must be said, that from
the first day they came aboard us,
they had such care, by their Holy
Example, to promote a good life a∣mongst
the Officers and seamen, that
far from following the loose way of
others, they thought themselves ob∣liegd
to behave themselves according
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
to the utmost severity of the <HI>Christian
Religion;</HI> they were willingly present
at their Catechisms and Sermons on
<HI>Sundays,</HI> and at Mass every morning,
with prayers at the end for the King;
in the evening we said our beads, and
the Litany of the Blessed Virgin,
making an <HI>Examen</HI> of <HI>Conscience</HI> on our
knees with an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Contriction.</HI></P>
<P>Great was the happiness and ad∣vantages
we had from the company
of these Religious persons, but chiefly
the sick; one of the <HI>Mandarins</HI> nam'd
<HI>Pipit</HI> dy'd the <HI>7th.</HI> day of his distem∣per;
the <HI>R. P. Fachard</HI> took parti∣cular
care of him, never leaving him
till he had administerd extream <HI>Unction,</HI>
and the <HI>Holy Eucharist</HI> to him. Of
these three Envoys of the King of <HI>Siam,</HI>
he converted two to the <HI>Catholick
Religion,</HI> Baptizing them at <HI>Brest,</HI> and
'tis to be presum'd that the third
would soon have yeilded too, to the
Authority of his holy Life, as well
as that of his Arguments.</P>
<P>All the funeral Honours due to a
person of Quality, were paid to this
deceas'd <HI>Mandarin:</HI> Four <HI>Gard Marines</HI>
held the corners of the Pall, and after
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
the usual prayers on the occasion,
threw him into the Sea, with five
Guns, fir'd at a distance one from
another, which made it more sad and
Sollemn; 'twas believ'd in the rest of
the ships that 'twas an Ensign dy'd, so
to honour him, and to testify to their
Admiral their concern for him, they
struck their sails, and lay by, rolling
in his way sadly, as if there were
none to govern them; as soon as the
ship past by, they hoist their Sails
again.</P>
<P>The next night, which was the
<HI>15th,</HI> we past the <HI>Tropick</HI> of <HI>Cancer,</HI>
which our Pilots perceiv'd next day
by the computation they made, we
had made vast way in a little time,
being but sixteen days since we left
<HI>France;</HI> the winds and seas seem'd to
conspire to prosper our Voyage, every
thing succeeding to our wishes.</P>
<P>The <HI>17th.</HI> in the Evening Mon∣sieur
<HI>Duquesne</HI> made the <HI>Cape,</HI> of which
he gave notice to the rest by the signal
of a Gun, and two fires, one on the
Round-top of the Main-Mast, and
the other on the Round-top of the
Fore-mast, for fear we should run
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
aground in the night, from which
we could not be far, according to the
Elevation taken at Noon: Next morn∣ing
by break of day we perceiv'd
the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>May</HI> to the left, which we
no sooner doubel'd, but we saw that
of <HI>Saintiage,</HI> our Commandant per∣ceiving
no ships at anchor there,
hoisted a white Flag and an Admiral
Flame on the top of the Main-mast,
and coming near, he sent in the <HI>Rock</HI>
to sound; there appear'd at a great
distance a Man on the top of a hill,
who hoisted a flag six several times, in
all probability to give the Inhabitants
notice of the number of our ships.
<HI>Saturday</HI> the <HI>18th.</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> at two
in the afternoon, we anchor'd half a
League from the shoar.</P>

<P>THE Commandant Monsieur <HI>de
Pouriere</HI> went a shoar by Mon∣sieur
<HI>Duquesnes</HI> orders, to complement
the Governor, and to desire leave to
take in fresh water, and to settle the
teremony of the Salute; who easily
agreed to what was desir'd, and not
only so, but promis'd we should be
furnisht with Beef and Mutton, tho'
very scarce among themselves; but
when it came to the ceremony of the
Salute, this raw young Governor,
who in all probality was ignorant of
what was really our due, refused to
answer Gun for Gun; but the Com∣mandant
provokt at it, told him; that
the <HI>French</HI> expected other returns, and
that seeing he stood so stiff upon't,
they would not salute him at all:
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
'Twas then he perceiv'd he mistook

five Guns each,</P>

suddainly: We lay at anchor till <HI>Tues∣day</HI>
evening, without perceiving any,
whence we pursu'd our Voyage, not
a little troubl'd to miss 'em, for they
could hardly escape falling into our
hands: Being now late, we omitted
the Salute till next morning, which
was <HI>Palm-Sunday;</HI> when after our
<HI>Almoner</HI> had said <HI>Mass,</HI> we saluted
them with five Guns, and they returned
the same number.</P>
<P>Being curious to go a shoar, I got
leave of the Commandant, and so
went in company with <HI>F. Tachard,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
and an Officer, who carri'd a small
Present from Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> to
the Governour; at our landing, we
saw some <HI>Negro's</HI> that were quite
naked, excepting a ragg about their
wasts to cover their nakedness.
There's a Chapel on the shoar dedi∣cated
to the <HI>Blessed Virgin,</HI> and a little
further a Battery of four Iron Guns;
we were forced to climb, 'till we came
to a certain Bastion, on which were
mounted six old Iron Guns, of which
the biggest was a six pounder. This
is the best fortify'd part of the Island,
where the <HI>Portuguese</HI> keep a Garrison,
but the Soldiers are fitter to be pitty'd
than fear'd.</P>
<P><HI>F. Tachard</HI> askt them news of the
Governour; they shew'd him a Church
where he was, into which we enterd,
when he presently rose from his seat,
and gave us a graceful salute, the Fa∣ther
after talking some time with him
in <HI>Portuguese,</HI> went out; but I conti∣nu'd
some time observing the Ceremo∣nies,
and other things; after blessing
the <HI>Palm</HI> branches, a <HI>Negro</HI> Priest
said Mass, assisted by a <HI>Deacon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="14"/>
They are more devout and solemn
than we, but we were a little scanda∣liz'd
at the negress women half naked
in the Church, who as they star'd at
us, so we could not but stare at them;
as likewise at the Governour's Guard,
which was a wretched one; their
Arms were a Pike and a Sword of an
extraordinary length, with a pair of
Beads about their necks.</P>
<P>In the midst of them stood the little
Governor, of about twenty year old;
a Native of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> pretty tall, but
meanly clad, and of a poor meen and
air.</P>
<P>This is a wretched Country, and
fitter to starve than live in; they have
their wine and bread from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> or
from the <HI>Cunarys,</HI> the latter is 8 pence
a pound, and the first half a Crown
a Bottel, which holds no more than
the Chopin of <HI>France;</HI> 'tis true the
<HI>Negro's</HI> who are naturally fober, use
little wine, or even so much as bread;
living for the most part of dry cake
well prest, which is made of the root
of a tree call'd <HI>Macoc,</HI> the Juice of
which is a subtil poison.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="14"/>
They are all Soldiers or Slaves,
and so given to robbery, that its
hard to escape them, if they meet one
in a by place, they are very fond of
knives, ribbon, needles, but chiefly
of Biscuit, for which they readily give
Oranges, Goiaves, Bannanes, and se∣veral
other fruits, they have large
proportion'd bodies, short friz'd hair,
little beard, and whither hunting or
walking, they still carry bows and ar∣rows
about 'em.</P>
<P>No one will wonder at the sterillity
of the Country, when he is told it
has not rain'd there in four years time;
which has made the ground so parcht
and barren, that of 25000 inhabitants
which it had, there dy'd 6000 in two
years time of hunger, as one of their
Priests told me, with whom I discours'd
some time in Latin.</P>
<P>The Cloathing of the women is
only a piece of white or blew cotton
cloath, that covers them from the
wast to the knee, the rest of their bo∣dy
is naked, going barefoot and bare∣headed,
only sometimes wearing an
ordinary handkerchief round their
heads, and for the most part gold
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
Rings, or three wooden pins in their
ears. These women have their pe∣culiar
beauties, as tall, proper, comely,
and well proportioned bodies, and a
certain great air, especially when they
walk; they smoak much, and are
scarce ever seen without a pipe.</P>
<P>I was to see the Town of <HI>Saintiague,</HI>
about three Leagues from the place
our ships lay at anchor; where I was
told that he whom I took for Gover∣nour,
was only the Lieutenant; the
Governor residing always at <HI>Saintiague.</HI>
This is a little Town in a bottom,
scituated by the sea side, thro' which
a large River takes its course, descend∣ing
from the neighbouring Moun∣tains
which surround it; It has a mat∣ter
of three hundred houses; the best
part of the Inhabitants are <HI>Portuguese,</HI>
the rest <HI>Negro's,</HI> these last go naked,
the former clad after their own Fa∣shion,
having all Beads about their
necks.</P>
<P>There's a Bishop in this Twon, a
Native of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> of the order of <HI>St.
Frances;</HI> and two Convents, one of
Men and the other of Women.
There's a Fort raised at the end of the
<PB N="21" REF="15"/>
Town, mounted with two cast Guns,
and at the foot of it eight, and three
Iron Guns, mouthing towards the sea;
hard by, is the Isle of <HI>Fougo,</HI> or the
<HI>Fiery Island,</HI> where there's a very
high mountain, whose top casts, fourth
flames continually, with a thick smoak.
This is all I could remark in the short
stay I made here.</P>
<P><HI>Saintiague</HI> is an Island of <HI>Cape Verde,</HI>
belonging to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> which is
scituated in fourteen degrees, thirty six
Minutes North Lat. and three hundred

Longitude. I have already said, that
provisions were so scarce here, that
we could have but one Bullock, which
was divided amongst us all, and some
sheep for the Commodant, but plenty
of excellent Fish is caught here. We
got some barrels of fresh water
which was none of the best, and hard
to come by, having it out of a dirty
Cistern, which was a great distance
from the sea. After we had fill'd our

are commonly accompanied with cool

<P>'Tis then that troops of Fish leap∣ing
above the water of all sides, in∣vite

one day when the sea was a

beheld shoals of fish leaping above the

their fins were wet, to avoid the pur∣suit
of the <HI>Bonites,</HI> a large fish, who
is a great devourer of the rest; the

<P>We were within five or six Degrees

and by which we suffer'd extream∣ly;
our Wine and Victuals were
spoil'd, and our Vigor consum'd, and
our Distemper encreast daily through
the long and violent heats; the very
air that should keep us alive, almost
suffocated us, night and day the heat
was so excessive, that the very Sealing∣wax
we had in our trunks melted.
The rest of this Month past without
any thing remarkable, save that it
thunderd, with violent winds and rain,
which forwarded us very much in our

<P><PB N="25" REF="17"/>
'Twas not a little gastly, in the
horrors of dark and tempestious nights,
to see the Lightnings perform the office
of the day; which gave us no other
prospect, but that of a rising and a
yawning Ocean, into which two of
our Men fell.</P>
<P>The fifth of <HI>April</HI> our Carpenter

kept himself above water till he got

gave him his foot to take hold of,

them both at last.</P>

brought us considerably nearer the

<P>TO the Southward of the Line we
met with as long and frequent
Calms as before; which for some days
made us as earnestly wish to get at a
distance from it, as we did before to
pass it. There is nothing distresses a
Voyage more than those Calms, while
unable to go backward or forward, you
are forced to remain whole days in the
same place, scorching and broiling in
the sun, and tumbling on great rolling
waves and surges which are met here,
notwithstanding the calm, so that one
<PB N="27" REF="18"/>
can scarce stand on the deck; but be∣ing
past the Line about a hunderd
Leagues, our miseries began to abate,
as the South-East winds began to blow,
when we found our selves as in another
Climate, and to breath a more tem∣perate
air: This change rejoyc'd us all,
and was very happy for the sick, of
whom two parts in three presently re∣cover'd,
besides our hopes of doubling
the Cape of <HI>Good-hope</HI> encreast daily,
by the vast way we made, which
sometimes was no less than 55 Leagues
in 24 hours, and had been more, if
all our ships had sail'd alike, and one
had not been forc'd to stay for the
other, that we might not lose com∣pany,
so that we could not make the
same use of the wind as a single ship
would.</P>
<P>About this time Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI>
was inform'd of Monsieur <HI>Hortin's</HI>
sickness, who was Captain of the
<HI>Rock,</HI> as he was a person of great ex∣perience,
and whom he had a great
value for, he often visited him, and
order'd the Surgeons of the Squadron
to consult of his Distemper, who seem'd
to have good hopes of him, but his

age made him yield to the violence of
it, which took him off the <HI>22d.</HI> of

<P>Our Commandant was not much
put to it to chuse one in his place,
who was fit to succeed him; for he

acting on the same bodies, pro∣duced

<P>Hitherto we sail'd as happily as we

with the winds to Expedite our Voyage;
<PB N="30" REF="20"/>
the very water in the hold was not
corrupted, and being as happy as could
be expected in a voyage of this kind;
in a little time we met with the west∣ern
winds, which were necessary to
gain the Cape of <HI>Good-hope.</HI></P>
<P>The third of <HI>May</HI> we had them,
but they lasted but a little while,
coming about to the North, which
serving our purpose as well, we sailed
sixty Leagues in 24 hours with them,
which made us hope we should soon
be at the place where we were to an∣chor,
which every one earnestly desir'd,
so that our joy was excessive
when we reach'd the heighth of the
Cape. The judgment of our Pilots
was confirm'd by the sight of the <HI>Vel∣vet

Bird which is only seen there, be∣cause
half their plumage resembles
<HI>Velvet</HI> spotted with <HI>Pearl.</HI> We saw

but being in War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI>

it our business to get over it as soon

that place more dangerous, which at

<P>We could scarce bear as much sail
as was sufficient to keep the ships head
to the Waves, which while they roll'd,
often enter'd into them; the <HI>Dragon</HI>
lost the round top of her Main-Mast,

Leagues distance, two sea wolfs, and
a power of strange birds.</P>
<P>After having happily past this Bank,
and the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> we were past

we had no more to wish but to discover
the Isle of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> which was ab∣solutely

<P>THe Commandant gave the Gun

seem'd very well pleas'd to exchange

<P>This great present consisted of two

Orders to his subjects to furnish us
with whatever we had occasion, for
our Money.</P>
<P>Upon which Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI>
went a shoar that very day, to regu∣late

the <HI>Negro</HI>'s came from all parts, with
provisions, <HI>vix.</HI> Oxen, Cows, Kids, and
almost all other kinds of provisions,
which we had plenty every day, and at
very easy rates.</P>
<P>Our Commandant finding he could
at an easy rate refresh his men here
after their vast fatiegues, allow'd them
while they stai'd every day, as much
fresh provisions morning and evening
as they could eat, which were so
plentiful and cheap, that a fat Ox cost
but four Livers and a half, a Cow but
a Crown, and Pullets, Kids, Eggs,
Milk, and Fruits we had in ex∣change
for Knives, Paper, and bits of
Linen.</P>
<P>Of all other, they were fondest of
Knives and Linen: Being generally
Magicians, they made use of the first
to make characters, and with the last
they cover'd their nakedness; and
some of our men have bought an Ox
for an old tatter'd Shirt.</P>
<P>They were no less careful to supply
us aboard than a shoar, coming every
day in their Pirogues, which are little

Banows made of the hollow'd trunk
of a Tree; bringing us Ananas, Ba∣nanes,
Cocos, Lemons, Oranges,
and divers other excellent sorts of
fruits, which we had in plenty, as
well as of the other provisions while
we lay at anchor.</P>
<P>Every meal seem'd a feast, and in∣deed
we had no less than four or five

and a great deal of other game,
and there would be excellent fowling
if it were not for the inaccssible Moun∣tains.
The <HI>Orange</HI> and <HI>Lemon</HI> Trees
are not its least glory, they stand so
thick in some places, that one may
smell them at a great distance, and
distinguish them amongst crowds of
other odorifirocous Trees, not inferiour
even to them; there's scarce a sweet
Orange to be found, but all of a de∣licat
tartness, except some of a smaller
growth, that have neither the form
nor size of a true natural Orange.</P>
<P>The Island produces besides, ex∣cellent
Rice and Mill, thrice as large
as that of <HI>France,</HI> and were it more
even and compact, would be very fit
to live in. It seems to be but thinly
peopl'd, for I saw but one Village,
of about threescore or fourscore cot∣tages,
made and cover'd with branches
of <HI>Palm,</HI> under which the <HI>Negro's</HI> lie;
the entrance into them is so low, that
<PB N="41" REF="25"/>
one must creep to get into them;
they sleep on Mats of rice straw,
which they lay on the ground; one
sees nothing here which does not ar∣gue
the miserable life these Savages
lead.</P>
<P>Taking a view of this Village,
I had the curiosity to enter into a
wretched Hutt, built of stone and sand;
which they told me was a Pagod, or
Temple, in which these wretches wor∣ship
an Oxe's head, the forehead being
inscrib'd with <HI>Arabick</HI> characters; they
made him a grot in the wall, adorn'd
with shell work, where they plac'd
this reverend Divinity, and which
they remov'd a little after we went in,
whither 'twas they believ'd us unwor∣thy
to look on't, or that they observ'd
we slighted it as much as it deserv'd:
The middle of the Pagod was matted,
and on the right side as you enter,
there was a pole stuck in the ground
forkt at one end, supporting some
mother of pearl burnt; on the inside,
which I suppose serv'd for a lamp;
and a little lower of the same side,
was a stair-case of 5 steps, leading to
the place where the King sits.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="26"/>
To so many superstitions they joyn
a great many of the <HI>Mahometan,</HI> so
true it is that the Author of that infa∣mous
Religion, has sprea'd his follies
at so great a distance. When we ar∣riv'd,
it was the time of their <HI>Ramadam,</HI>
or <HI>Lent,</HI> during which they mayn't
eat, drink, or smoak 'till the sun's
set, and they are so exact in't, that
no perswasions or threats can make
'em do otherwise.</P>
<P>These <HI>Negro's</HI> appear'd more Savage
than they of <HI>Saintiague,</HI> ruder in their
manner of living, but more plain in
their dealing; they are large, and
strong bodied, but very fearful; a
Pistol shot will scare them so, that
they'll run into the woods to hide,
so much they fear fire Arms. They
were long beards, and their hair cover∣ing
their shoulders; for 'tis to be ob∣serv'd,
that to the south of the Line,
they all have them thus, and to the
North, have short friz'd hair; they
all go naked, having only a rag of
Linen to cover their nakedness,
and some wear beads about their
necks without crosses, and holes in
<PB N="43" REF="26"/>
their Ears that your finger will go
through.</P>
<P>I could never imagine that these
Savages could be so jealous of their
Wives, for they hid them in their
Cottages as we past by, that we
might not see them, judging our in∣clinations
I suppose by their own;
we saw, some of their women who
are not easily to be distinguished
from their Men, but by their habit;
which consists of a piece of Linen that
crosses their Stomacks, and so falls
down their breasts, with another which
binds their Thghes behind and before
like drawers: They are very wild,
for when I but touch'd one of their
ears, to observe three little pieces of
wood she had in them, she skriekt
out, and ran as if I intended to eat
her.</P>
<P>Tho' Idolaters, yet they are very
temperate and sober; and for the most
part feed only on fish, fruits and Rice,
and rarely eat any flesh, tho' they
have plenty. Their best drink is
<HI>Tarry,</HI> which is very refreshing, and
much resembles the Cider made of
pears in <HI>Britany,</HI> it costs them no more
<PB N="44" REF="27"/>
pains than the rest of their provisions,
which the unmanur'd soil freely fur∣nishes
'em with of its own accord.
It is no more than cutting the bottom
of the Palm trees, and placing Vessels
beneath to receive it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Squadron parts from the road of
<HI>Moelly,</HI> on the news we receiv'd
that there were some ships of the
Enemy at <HI>Amiouam.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE had lain at anchor about Se∣ven
or Eight days, when we
understood by a <HI>Negro,</HI> who spoke
<HI>Portuguese,</HI> that there lay some ships
at <HI>Amiouam.</HI> Tho' the information
was uncertain, yet it gave us a great
deal of joy, and the Commandant
gave notice that we should make ready
to sail in two days, so we made hast
to take in all necessaries, and to sup∣ply
our selves with water, wood,
and fresh provisions, to take down
<PB N="45" REF="27"/>
our Tents, and embark the sick, of
whom we lost one at land, and three
the day we landed, whom we cast in∣to
the sea, which with eleven we lost
in crossing the Line, made in all fifteen
since we left <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This evening Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI>
gave orders for sailing, and according∣ly
next day being <HI>Saturday</HI> the first of
<HI>July,</HI> we left the road of <HI>Moelly</HI> at 5 in
the morning, but were becalm'd al∣most
all that day, except a faint wind
that blew sometimes, which serv'd
us a little till six in the evening, when
we came to an anchor again, for that
night; next day we sail'd, and it
blowing a fresh gale, about ten we
doubled the Isle of <HI>Moelly,</HI> and
by reason of the Tides we were
fore'd to coast it near the Shoar.</P>
<P>We presently made all the sail we
could that we might reach <HI>Amiouam</HI>
as soon as possible, which was now in
sight, the <HI>Rock</HI> still kept close to us,
and in a little time the rest came up
within 3 or 4 Leagues of us: and now
we took down our hamocks, and
made every thing ready for a fight,
tho' we had no plain sight of any ship∣ing,
<PB N="46" REF="28"/>
till we came near the road, when
we perceived one lying at anchor
near to land, and the smoak of two
guns which were fir'd to warn the men
aboard.</P>
<P>'Twas now Sun-set, and we had
yet two Leagues before we could
come up with her; all had orders to
prepare, and we as usual, were posted
on the quarter Deck, we had already
hung out <HI>Dutch</HI> colours, and put a
square Flag on the top of the Main∣mast,
making in with full sails to set
upon her by day light.</P>

<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Engagement at <HI>Amiouam</HI> with
an <HI>English</HI> ship richly laden,
which was burnt with above three
hunderd persons in her.</HEAD>
<P>THis ship took a pleasure to see
us coming in, believing us to
be <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the rather, because
Seven ships were to be sent this year
<PB N="47" REF="28"/>
from <HI>Holland</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> but
to rid them of their mistake, the <HI>Rock</HI>
who had gain'd the wind of us, ap∣proacht
according to orders, with a
design to anchor on her Buoy; we
then took in our Flag, which very
much surpriz'd them, who presently
hall'd the <HI>Rock,</HI> and askt him whence
he was bound, and the Captain an∣swering
in <HI>Dutch</HI> from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> they
seem'd mightily pleas'd; then he asking
them again whence their ship was,
answer'd, from <HI>London.</HI> The Captain
was just ready to go aboard him, when
the sloop which he had sent to get
intelligence of us, and which he had
order'd to go aboard the <HI>Admiral</HI> if
they were <HI>Dutch,</HI> keeping close to the
land side, for fear of being taken,
came to give him notice that we were
<HI>French;</HI> this unexpected news surpriz'd
him very much, and immediately
gave orders to charge the guns; which
the <HI>Rock</HI> observing, presently came
and anchord on his buoy, and straight
powerd in his small shot, with a broad
side into her, crying, <HI>Vive le Roy<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Vive France.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="29"/>
The <HI>English</HI> much surpriz'd, re∣turn'd
us five guns, and going to tack
about, the <HI>Rock</HI> at the second discharge
splitting the Capstain, and wounded
two and twenty of his men, upon
which she cut away, and hoist sail
with all the speed she could, which
Monsieur <HI>Pouriere</HI> who was resolv'd to
follow her close, no sooner observ'd
but he cut his Cables too, and call'd to
us to board her for that she was just
sailing away.</P>
<P>Our Commandant knowing what
he had to do, presently tackt, and
got under the wind with her, who
fir'd on us with both her broad sides,
seeing herself oblig'd to pass between
us and the <HI>Rock,</HI> who still kept the
wind of her, and power'd his Musket
shot into her, but we had no sooner
suffer'd her to go a little a head of us,
but we ply'd her with our great and
small shot from both our ships, the
<HI>English</HI> ship scarce firing at all, and
thinking of nothing but of making
her escape by the favour of the
night.</P>
<P>But his endeavours were to no pur∣pose,
for we were resolv'd to ply him
<PB N="49" REF="29"/>
close all night; after the third dis∣charge,
the Commandant order'd us
to cease firing, while a message was
sent to him, that if he would not sur∣render,
he should be hang'd up, on
the Main-yard; this threatening mes∣sage,
which might have frightend a∣nother,
gave him so little concern,
that he answer'd it with as many great
Guns as he could, at which we ad∣mir'd
at the undaunted courage and re∣solution
of the man, to stand it out
at such a desperate rate, when there
was no hopes of escapeng.</P>
<P>So we renew'd the fight, and were
board and board with him, our
Mainyards almost touching for a
good while, 'twas now we gall'd him
terribly with our great and small shot,
and scarce one miss'd, when if we
might judge according to appearance,
he must needs have last half his Com∣pany.
Yet for all this he shew'd no
sign of fear, or any thing like it; for
we could not hear 'em so much as
once cry for Quarter: But on the con∣trary,
receiving our shot without fir∣ing,
he lengthen'd out his Sprit-sail
<PB N="50" REF="30"/>
that he might come close to us, be∣lieving
we had a design to board him,
at which time he long'd for nothing
more, for if we had, he was resolv'd
to blow us up, tho' at the expence of
setting himself a fire, but happily the
night coming on, was the cause the
Commandant gave orders not to at∣tempt
it, so being contented for the
present with what we had done, we
stood aloof, and lay at some distance
one from another, only the <HI>Rock</HI>
would not quit her a moment, but
continued still firing incessantly at
her.</P>
<P>By this time the rest of the Squa∣dron
came up, who presently began
to fire on the unhappy <HI>Englishman,</HI> and
surrounded him of all sides, that the
ship scarce knew which way to turn
her head; the bullets fell like hail in∣to
her, and the night was now so dark
that one could scarce discern any thing,
which was the cause that our ships
incommoded one another, notwith∣standing
our lanthors were all fill'd
with lights.</P>
<P>The enemy having for some time
receiv'd a great many shot from us,
<PB N="51" REF="30"/>
without making any return, and
thought of nothing but meeting with
a convenient opportunity to make their
escape. When Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> ob∣serving
'twas in vain to wast povvder
and shot, and that 'twas to no purpose
to think of reducing him before day,
sent an arm'd sloup with an Officer,
commanding all the ships not to fire
any more, but only keep a strict watch
on her all night.</P>
<P>It might be now about eleven a
clock, the action having lasted with∣out
intermission since eight, when the
Commandant order'd us to repose our
selves for a while; and the sloop going
to the <HI>Rock</HI> with these orders; Mon∣sieut
<HI>de Pouriere,</HI> the Captain of it,
sent us a young <HI>Malouin</HI> Seaman, who
made his escape from aboard the ene∣my
by swiming, and had come aboard
him, after his second discharge.</P>
<P>This man inform'd us, that the
<HI>English</HI> Captain, after giving all his
men a large bowl of Canary, exhorted
them to fight it out to the last; tell∣ing
them at the same time too, that
he was resolv'd to set fire to the ship
before ever it should fall into our hands,
<PB N="52" REF="31"/>
if we prov'd to be <HI>French;</HI> which he
but too well perform'd, as you'l see
by what follows. The ships name
was the <HI>Herbert▪</HI> built for eighty
Guns; carrying but 54; and two
hunderd and fifty men, with about
fourscore passengers, amongst whom
was a rich <HI>English</HI> Bankrupt, who had
fourscore thousand crowns in silver,
having with him his wife and a daugh∣ter,
a great beauty about twenty years
old, with two young sons, one of
which was born under the Line.</P>
<P>He told us the Cargo of the ship
consisted of Laces, and Brocard of
gold, scarlet cloaths, Bevers, Iron, To∣bacco,
Canary wines, and a great
deal of Money; ordered for commerce,
and paying off the <HI>English</HI> soldiers
in the service of the Company, who
had receiv'd no pay in four years time,
and that if taken would prove a vast
rich Prize, which very much rejoyc'd
us. But the desperate Captain took
care that none should be the richer for't,
or gain by what he lost.</P>
<P>So we gave over firing in good time,
for besides that it signify'd nothing;
we should a done our selves as much
<PB N="53" REF="31"/>
damage as the enemy; at length he
made four or five shot at us, to waken
our Squadron out of that profound
steep it seem'd to have been in, and
then lay still; and continuing so for
some time, about two in the morning
the wind blowing fresh, she made all
the sail she could to escape the ap∣proaching
danger.</P>
<P>He thought the same happiness
would have attended him now; which
he had had at the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands,
where its said he clear'd himself of
three stout <HI>Algerines</HI> that surrounded
him; but he soon found to the con∣trary,
for he was no sooner under sail,
but we began to follow him, when
seeing there was no possibillity of escap∣ing,
and that as soon as 'twas day, we
should bear down upon him in a line,
and sink him; Fir'd with rage and des∣pair,
he took the most cruel resoluti∣on
in the world; and without any more
delay set fire to his ship, placing two
chests of powder under the highest
part of the stern, near the Mizzen
Mast; making his escape himself thro'
the Gunners room in his boat, in which
they perceiv'd a light, but he endea∣vour'd
<PB N="54" REF="32"/>
to hide it that they might not
follow him.</P>
<P>This dreadful spectacle amaz'd us ex∣ceedingly,
and as eargerly as we endea∣vour'd
to attack her before, as hastily we
attempted to avoid her now; our men
lookt on't as belonging to themselves;
and could not but censure the Cap∣tain,
for acting so cruel and inhumane
a part, as not to save his Cargo, or
perish with them himself. But this
horrible proceeding quite ruin'd the
opinion, we had before conceiv'd of
his bravery.</P>
<P>Some of our men heard these miser∣able
people crying out like the damn'd,
and runing up the bolt sprit in crowds,
endeavouring to avoid the flames,
which rag'd so violenty, but 'twas in
vain. The ship continually burning
for three hours, when at length the
flames catching in the powder room,
it blew up all at once; so that in less
than half a quarter of an hour there
was nothing to be seen of that rich
ship, but dreadful conflagration.</P>
<P>Our single ship fir'd for her share
no less than 200 and 80 guns, and we
had five men kill'd and six wounded;
<PB N="55" REF="32"/>
I could not receive an exact account
of what the rest suffer'd, but I am cer∣tain
we suffer'd most; after having re∣pair'd▪
what damage we sustain'd, we
steer'd our course North North East,
and left <HI>Amiouam</HI> behind us, Monsieur
<HI>de Pourier</HI> being unable to regain the
Point was constrain'd to cut his cables.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">We past the Line a second time in the

<P>WE were to pass the Line again
before we could arrive at
<HI>Pontichery,</HI> tho' in doing of it, we felt
no extraordinary heat, nor the other
usual inconveniences, nor were so
much as becalm'd; of the contrary,
the wind encreasing still more and
more since our departure, on <HI>Monday</HI>

<PB N="56" REF="33"/>
when we were under it, by
reason of the Southern winds which
blew so fresh, that the heat was less
then that we often feel at <HI>Paris</HI> in sum∣mer:
Never was Voyage happier; sail∣ing
no less than three or four Leagues
an hour, and the winds as good and
constant as we could desire.</P>
<P>Sailing so succesfully, we could
not miss arriving quickly in the heigth
of the <HI>Maldives,</HI> which we left of the
right, without so much as seeing them;
tho' we had sent the <HI>Lyon</HI> on the <HI>20th.</HI>
to discover them they are seldon past
unseen, but our Pilots according to
their Card, and their calculation, told
us they must be there, so we reckon'd
we should soon be at the Isle of <HI>Ceylon,</HI>
whither we were order'd to go, to
see if there were any of the Ene∣my's
ships there, for besides that the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> had several Collonies there,
the <HI>English</HI> came thither every year
for <HI>Nutmegs, Cinnamon,</HI> and <HI>Cloves,</HI>
with which this Island greatly abounds.</P>
<P>The same day one of our Seamen
was drown'd about six at night, when
the rest of our men were at supper;
all things seem'd to conspire to his
<PB N="57" REF="33"/>
loss, a slack wind in our stern, made
the ship rowl very much, and instead
of eating with his Comarades accord∣ing
to custom, he went on the Deck
to kill a Kidd, were treading on the
blood of the Kidd, he slipt, and fell
into the sea, to which the rowling of
the ship very much contributed; he
was a pretty vvay off us before vve
perceiv'd it, and so could give him
no help by casting out ropes, the Mar∣riners
did all that they could, and
Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> order'd them to
take dovvn the sails, and hoise the
boat out, but 'tvvas too late; and
we saw him perish, without our being
able to give him the least assistance.</P>
<P>Next day, being the <HI>22d.</HI> there hap∣pen'd
a pleasant, but an unlucky, mi∣stake,
presently after noon, the Seamen
cry'd <HI>Land</HI> before us; and we immedi∣ately
believ'd that 'twas the Coast of
<HI>Coromandal,</HI> or the Isle of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> we made
the ordinary signal, and presently after
discover'd eight Islands, near one ano∣ther,
which joyn'd to the view we had
of land to the South, made Monsieur
<HI>Duquesne</HI> say, that 'twas certainly the
<HI>Maldives;</HI> the Pilots could not be of his
<PB N="58" REF="34"/>
opinion, and the reputation of their skill
and judgment was concern'd, to differ
from him: In the mean time after peru∣sing
the Cards and their Journals, they
own'd their mistake, and agreed that the
biggest sight of land, was the point
of the <HI>Maldives,</HI> which is the most
Northerly Island of all the rest which
we found too true; and we attributed
the cause of this mistake, to the strong
Currents which they found had
thrown us too much to the west, we
presently tack't about, and lay by all
night, for fear of being run aground
by the tides.</P>

<HI>Dutch</HI> Pink with eight chests of
Silver made Prize.</HEAD>
<P>FRom break of day 'till <HI>Friday</HI> the
<HI>28th.</HI> we made all the sail we
could, when <HI>Loyseau▪</HI> who kept the
<PB N="59" REF="34"/>
head of the Squadron, made a signal
of his discovering land, and after we
had descry'd it our selves too on the
edge of the Horrison, we hoisted our
flag to give notice to the rest: 'Twas
not long before we plainly perceiv'd
the Isle of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> at which we very
much rejoyc'd, having all along ex∣pected
to meet some of the Enemys
ships there. I think I never saw a
more pleasant Country, being very
even and of a vast extent, and one of
the most rich and fertill in the world;
you see here a great number of tall
Trees ever green; some forming lovely
Arbours, others beautiful alleys, in
the vast plaines which stretcht them∣selves
towards the sea side, besides a
rich smell of Nutmegs and Cinnamon,
charming and delicious beyond Ex∣pression.</P>
<P>Of the three Mountains in this
Island, there is one remarkable for
its heigth and name, being the Peke
of <HI>Adam,</HI> and by some believ'd that
<HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were bury'd here,
which is as great a certainty as that
other opinion, they have here; that
God in this Island establisht the terre∣strical
<PB N="60" REF="35"/>
Paradice, which I leave to the
more knowing to judge of.</P>
<P>This Isle is plac'd between 6 and 10
Deg. of North Lat. and 103 Deg. of
Long. its form is round, and may be
about 250 Leagues in compass, or
better. The <HI>Dutch</HI> who are Masters
of it, draw an immence revennue
thence, for the Nutmegs, and Cin∣namon,
as well as the Pearl, which
is fisht up here.</P>
<P>Coasting the Island we discoverd
two sail a head of us, who seem'd to
keep at a distance from the Island, but
presently made to land when they
saw us. Our Commandant impati∣ent
to know whence they were,
thought to snap them by hoisting up
<HI>English</HI> colours, and making all the sail
he could; the <HI>Dragon</HI> as the swiftest
sailer went to cut off their way, and
when we were vvithin shot of them,
vve fir'd a gun, as did the <HI>Dragon</HI> too,
and the ball so scar'd em that instead
of coming aboard as vve hop'd; they
presently fled for refuge to a house
by the sea side; a fevv hours after, the
Sentinel vvho vvas on the top, cry'd
a <HI>Sail;</HI> I can't easily describe the dif∣ferent
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>
motions of joy it caus'd amongst
us; some vvent up to the round-top,
others to the fane, others vvho could
not so easily do it, stood in the shrouds,
and the rest made use of their Per∣spectives
to discover a vessel, which
could not yet be seen but by her top,
yet after an hours sailing, she was
plainly disern'd, to be three Leagues
off.</P>
<P>The Sun was already set, and we
fear'd but one thing; which was, that
she would sail off in the night and so
escape us, by taking a contrary course,
so that we scarce knew what to do,
tho' we were sure she lay at anchor,
our Commandant considerd of it, be∣ing
loath to do, as he had done before
at <HI>Amiouam,</HI> where he shot a matter
of eight hunderd shot at random in
the night, when fifty would serve by
day light, so he resolv'd to ly by
her all night, without attempting any
thing; by which means we shou'd con∣firm
her the more in her mistake of
us.</P>
<P>So we anchord in 25 fathom water
at seven a-clock, and next morning be∣ing
the <HI>25th.</HI> weighed anchor again
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>
at 5 in the morning the wind blow∣ing
fresh quickly brought us to the
sight of her, for which we were so
much concern'd all night, least she
should make her escape. We first heard
Mass, after that we breakfasted, and
then Monsieur <HI>Duqusne</HI> orderd to hoise
up <HI>English</HI> colours; the Enemy mistak∣ing
their friends, answer'd us by hang∣ing
out <HI>Dutch</HI> colours, whithour stir∣ing
from where they lay, giving us all
the time and opportunity we could
wish for, to attack them, and now indeed
it was in vain to attempt an escape,
if they had known we were <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>This Vessel lay at Anchor in the
road of <HI>Mevelle,</HI> under the shelter of
a high ground, which hinder'd her
having a sight of us the night before.
The <HI>Rock</HI> whom we follow'd enter'd
into the same road, and anchor'd by
her side, which she had scarce done,
but the <HI>Dutch</HI> underdanding what we
were, endeavour'd to get ashoar in
their sloop with their richest things;
at the same time Monsieur <HI>de Pouriere</HI>
man'd out his sloop▪ after our Com∣mandant
had return'd back again, un∣willing
that any should share the first
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>
advantage with him, which was very
Considerable, else the enemy had not
had time to go ashoar, and save what
they did, and we had certainly taken
2 Women who cary'd off eight hun∣dred
Caupants of gold, to the vallue
of above 10000 crowns in Pearls and
Jevvels.</P>
<P>While these fled ashoar, we made
a detatchment of six Gard Marins and
several Musketeers to arm the sloop,
and the boat, in which Monsieur
<HI>Dauberville,</HI> our Lieutenant, was com∣manded
to board the <HI>Dutch</HI> man; I
was chosen with one of my com∣marades
to accompany him, and the
other four going in the boat, we went
directly to the Pink while the men
aboard her Smoaking their pipes veiw'd
us with little or no Concern, but se∣ven
or eight, more affirighted than the
rest, cry'd out to the <HI>Negros,</HI> who
were not far off; to fetch them a shoar
in their Perogues, vvhich they did;
notwithstanding all our threats; the
<HI>Dutch</HI> lept into it confusedly, but our
men in the boat Coming up with them
at the first fire so scar'd them, that
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>
they chose to Row back again to their
ship, and there abide the utmost.</P>
<P>We were within pistol shot of the
ship, when we saw one of the Sea∣men
busy at one of the Guns, upon
which we in a manner gave our selves
for lost, and Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> had
the same opinion of us; and had they
been men of any resolution, nothing
had been easier than to have destroy'd
us, by levelling one gun at the boat,
and another at the sloop.</P>
<P>'Twas now some time since our
Squadron had hung out <HI>French</HI> co∣lours,
and the enemy-thinking all re∣sistance
vain; took down theirs, when
we presently boarded them, without
the least resistance, crying, <HI>Vive le
Roy.</HI></P>
<P>One would scarce believe with what
earnestness and violence the Seamen
pillage, when they enter a ship, break∣ing
open trunks and boxes, and rifling
every thing, nay, they were so violent
in plundring these <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> that some
of them fell on the Captain, who was
smoaking quietly with his Lieutenant,
tearing the gold buttons out of the
neck and sleeves of his shirt, and
<PB N="65" REF="37"/>
taking six Caupants of gold from
him, which is a sort of long money
of <HI>Japan,</HI> of the value of ten crowns a
piece.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>D' Auberville</HI> having em∣barqued
all the Spoil he received from
the Seamen that boarded her, sent
back the Boat to our Commandant;
who landed some men in it, soon e∣nough
to recover eight of those Ele∣ven
Chests of Silver, which the Ene∣my
had carried off in their sloop. Our
men soon discover'd them, by a track
of <HI>Rix Dollars</HI> that were scatter'd on
the Sand, which lead them directly
to the place where the <HI>Dutchmen</HI> had
hid them; but our persuit being vigo∣rous,
they they had not time enongh
to convey them to a Counter about
2 Leagues distant.</P>
<P>Some of the Seamen got no less
than 3 or 400 Crowns in the plunder,
for their share, and afterwards their
thoughts run on nothing else but more
prize and pillage. This was a new
Pink, of about 70 Tun, and came from
<HI>Batavia</HI> ballasted with Rice, to load
Nutmegs and Cinnamon at <HI>Ceylon.</HI>
We fetcht her out of the road of <HI>Me∣velle,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="38"/>
and brought her to an anchor
hard by our Squadron; the prisoners
we desperst amongst us, Monsieur <HI>Du∣quesne</HI>
took six of the chief of them,
with the Captain and Lieutenant,
whom he treated at his own Table,
and omitted no part of Civillity, that
might lessen the sense of their present
loss and imprisonment.</P>

still on the watch for more Prize.
We were very much delay'd here by
a calm that lasted four days, and the
slow sailing of the Prize, which could
not keep us company; we took in

<P>Being thus separated on the 6th. of

before she could gain the land, which
she endeavour'd with all the speed she
could; at a distance we believ'd her
as big as the <HI>Rock,</HI> but after giving he

<P>AFter we had cruis'd for some time
upon the Isle of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> we left
it, and made towards the main Land;
<PB N="69" REF="39"/>
the 9th. of <HI>August</HI> we anchor'd within
five leagues of the <HI>Negapatan,</HI> which
is a Town on the coast of <HI>Coramandel,</HI>
where the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a Fort, and a
considerable Factory. Next day, hav∣ing
weigh'd anchor early in the morn∣ing,
we arriv'd there betimes, and
every one being greedy of Action, we
were overjoy'd to see six ships there,
that seem'd to us of a considerable
burthen.</P>
<P>The Fort discovering us, set up
<HI>Dutch</HI> colours, and three of these ships,
of which the greatest, as Admiral,
hung them out on the Main mast top;
we answer'd them presently with <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
colours, which did not puzzle
them a little to discover what we
were; in the mean time we made in
with full sail, ready and forward to
engage.</P>
<P>But just as we thought to seize our
prey two accidents happen'd that baukt
us extreamly; the wind blowing from
the land, and a Sand bank which vve
discover'd, hinderd us from coming
within shot of them; we past on still
sounding, and were once in four fa∣thom
<PB N="70" REF="40"/>
and an half, the ships mudding
the water as they past.</P>
<P>These delays and these turnings,
gave them time to discover what we
were; so that the Admiral who an∣chor'd
at large, suspecting our tacking
about so long, made close into the
land, intending to run herself aground,
if pursued, others follow'd her ex∣ample,
and two rang'd themselves un∣der
the Cannon of the Fort.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> meeting with
such difficulties, would undertake no∣thing

resolv'd to run no riske, for besides
that there was nothing to be done,
we were in great danger of running a

stood to fea.</P>
<P>An hour after we discover'd three
more, which we reckon'd would make
us amends for our former loss,
but as soon as we came nigher, we
discover'd them to be <HI>Danes</HI> by their

that belongs to us, where there are
only two <HI>French</HI> who have but four or
five port-holes, with as many guns to
defend them, which rather make a

our <HI>East-India</HI> Company; situated
on the Coast of <HI>Coromandel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Coast of <HI>Coromandel</HI> is very
beautiful all along; the pleasant
mixture of Meadows and Trees ever
green, making a Charming prospect,
you meet with mountains here and
there, which intercept it, but are
themselves a prospect no less pleasant:
and some rising grounds, which you
overlook and loose your sight in de∣licious▪
fair, and wide extended
<PB N="74" REF="42"/>
plains; besides a number of beautiful
habitations by the sea side, where
you meet with another entertainment,
which to me seem'd very diverting,
which is a great number of <HI>Catimarons,</HI>
in which the <HI>Negros</HI> of the Country go
a fishing, they are made of two or
three pieces of a Tree, bound togea∣ther
with <HI>Coco</HI> cords, with a Mat sail
of a Triangular form, as they sit in
them their breech touches the water,
and yet they are not afraid to launch
out ten or twelve Leagues in them;
the sea is some times cover'd with
these <HI>Catimarons,</HI> which sail so swiftly,
tho' with nere so small a wind, that
at a distance you would take them for
birds skiming up and down on the
surface of the waters.</P>
<P>We past by a <HI>Dutch</HI> factory, before
which there lay only one bark, that
was not worth the taking coasting a
long, we at length arriv'd at <HI>Porta-Nova</HI>
at eleaven in the morning, near
which we saw four <HI>Pagods</HI> hard by one
another, in which the <HI>Negros</HI> worship
the Devil, we saw there three ships,
of which the biggest carry'd a flag on
the top of the Main-mast; these were
<PB N="75" REF="42"/>
worth the attacking, but whither they
were willing to spare us the paines,
or rather prevent their own danger,
they hung out <HI>Danish</HI> colours, And
nothing could impose upon us
more, tho' we can't Vindicate our
weakness in this matter, considering
they lay at anchor before a <HI>Dutch</HI>
factory, and knowing too, that the
<HI>Danes</HI> had but three ships in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
which we had just left at <HI>Frin∣quebart;</HI>
after having made a faint to
discover them, we left them to con∣tinue
our course.</P>
<P>We had so little wind, that vve
scarse expected to arrive the same day
at <HI>Ponticherri,</HI> and being afterwards
down-right becalm'd, we were oblig'd
to anchor 2 Leagues short of the <HI>Cour∣toir,</HI>
which is a Fort belonging to
Prince <HI>Gingi,</HI> a friend to the <HI>French</HI>
Nation, being now within 2 Leagues,
we took our own time, and next day
being <HI>Saturday,</HI> the 12 of <HI>August,</HI> the
wind blowing a little fresh, we sail'd,
and at eight in the morning arriv'd at
<HI>Pontecherri,</HI> where we found the <HI>Lyon</HI>
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pink, who came thither
but the day before.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="43"/>
We had scarce anchor'd within half
a league of the land, when the greatest
part of the Officers of the Fort came
to wait upon the Commandant; the
Fort saluted us with eleven guns, and
we could return but nine, because the
Deck was so incumber'd. Next day
Monsieur <HI>Martin,</HI> Director general for
the <HI>French East-India</HI> Company came
aboard, where he was receiv'd with
a salute of five guns, and nobly re∣gal'd
by Monsieur <HI>Duquesne,</HI> who de∣liver'd
him his Majesty's Letter, by
which he enabled him, and a few days
after perform'd the Ceremony of girt∣ing
him with a Sword by his side.</P>
<P>Our arrival here sprea'd a great and
general joy, which appear'd even a∣mongst
the <HI>Negro's</HI> of the Country;
who in their way exprest their satis∣faction,
and no doubt our own <HI>French</HI>
had reason to rejoice, to see us come
with a force sufficient to make the
<HI>Indies</HI> tremble; and their joy was e∣qual
to the consternation of the enemy,
who secretly dispatcht notice to all
the Factories on the Coast, to be on
their guard, against six <HI>French</HI> Priva∣teers,
the stoutest, and the best, that
<PB N="77" REF="43"/>
had yet been sent from <HI>Europe</HI> into
those parts.</P>
<P>This allarum which the <HI>English</HI> and
<HI>Dutch</HI> gave one another, did not a
little encrease the glory and reputati∣on
of <HI>France;</HI> they were no more to be
seen strutting in these parts, and hect∣oring
the Fort of <HI>Pontichery,</HI> threat∣ning
to burn the Director in't, as they
had done but two months before our
arrival, with I don't know what other
Rodomontado's; of the contrary, let
their strengrh be what they please to
bluster it in these parts, they did not
care for seeing us, or having any
thing to do with us.</P>
<P>We began with debarking the eight
chests of Silver we took out of the
<HI>Dutch</HI> prize, and four Musketeers con∣veyed
the Captain and Lieutenant to
the Fort till farther orders; our Com∣mandant
went a shoar at the same time,
and was receiv'd with a salute of five
guns. Monsieur <HI>Martin</HI> entertain'd
him so nobly, with the other Officesr
of the Squadron, that feasting and
hunting was all our employment, while

were not so cheap as we expected,

six ships, knowing we should have
need of all, presently rais'd their pri∣zes,
to that degree, that whereas
before one might have bought thirty
<HI>Henns</HI> for a crown, they now cost
a <HI>Fanon</HI> a piece, which is six sols
<HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Fanon</HI> is a little piece of mixt

pure gold, call'd a pagod, of the value

<PB N="79" REF="44"/>
only bigger, and the figure of an Idol im∣prest

of these last to a Fanon, and two Caches
to a Doudou.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negros</HI> found they were such
gainers by us, that from morning 'till

they furnisht us with the finest
fish that ever I tasted, which they
caught in such abundance, and with
so much speed, that for three pence
half penny we could buy as much as
would satisfy eight persons.</P>
<P>Our Men fed on Mutton, Pigs, and
a power of herbs, which they through
into the pot; which with other pro∣visions
made very good fare, but the
Rice, of which all our bread was made
since we took the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pink, was
not so agreable; especially to us who
were so little us'd to it, besides the un∣toward

washing it in salt water, they bakt it
with a little salt, and we were often

<P>I Was one of the first that landed,

by reason the sea all along the

but the <HI>Negros</HI> leap out, striving
who shall carry you out, first on his

<P><PB N="82" REF="46"/>
I saw a great number of them at
landing, of all sorts; some half nak∣ed,
others thinly clad in muslin shirts,
and turbants on their heads, and se∣veral
with their bodies painted of
divers colours; they saluted us in rais∣ing
the right hand to the top of the

way of saluting amongst them; you
see the Caze's rais'd of each side,

Women, so that they scarce

they have built themselves houses, in
which they live very happily; and
tho' that bread and wine is a little

great plenty.</P>
<P>They drink Punch, Rack, and Le∣monade,

<P>The Women are generally little,

with a callico scarfe, one end of which
crossing their shoulders, covers their

their heads, and knot it about their
Ears, which are loaded with gold
Rings.</P>
<P>They are as fond too of adorning
their arms and legs with braceletts;

them. The <HI>Parias</HI> are shoemakers,
and the most infamous of all, the
nastiest in their way of living, and
eat the bodies of dead creatures tho'
they died of sickness, not sparing the
rotton stinking gutts, and are very
vile and miserable, but the <HI>Brames</HI> and
the <HI>Faquers</HI> are those who are most
esteem'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brames</HI> are the Gentlemen, and
only they are permitted to wear silk
strings in bandaliers, and three lines
on their faces, two white, and one
red in the midple; their heads are
shav'd, except a tufft which they leave
on the top, they wear Muslin turbants,
and commonly shirts of the same, with
a delicate Callico, to touch which is a
crime that deserves punishment a∣mongst
them.</P>
<P>So that a <HI>French</HI> man one day ig∣norantly
touching one that belong'd to
a <HI>Brame,</HI> who was bathing himself,
they came to the Fort in crowds to
complain of him to Monsieur <HI>Martin,</HI>
and to demand him in order to have
justice done on him, they pretended
he was burnt, so they were obliged to
hide him, and after often remonstrat∣ing
<PB N="88" REF="49"/>
to them, that what he had done,
was out of ignorance not disrespect,
they were at last appeas'd; they eat
nothing that has life, neither flesh nor
fish, nor so much as eggs, living on
rice, Milk, Roots, and the like. They
won't be so much as seen eating, and
are so jealous of their honor, that they
think it a great disgrace to enter into
the house of a mean person.</P>
<P>These <HI>Brames,</HI> as all the rest, have
a great Veneration for cows, and will
not on any account suffer them to be
kild; being so useful to mankind by
their work and labour; and when our
men kill any, they are forc't to do it
in private, for fear of provoking these
<HI>Idolaters,</HI> who on the tenth of <HI>Jan.</HI>
the first day of their year, celebrate a
feast in honor of them.</P>
<P>On these days after feasting them∣selves
they lead all the cows and oxen
into a lake, where they wash them by
the sound of drums and the trumpets,
and paint their foreheads and horns;
after which they lead them to a pub∣lick
place, and each holding a nose∣gay
in his hand, they dance round
casting water on them, and often
<PB N="89" REF="49"/>
prostrating themselves on the Ground
the <HI>Brames</HI> direct these ceremonies;
and glory in being the most zealous
observers of these sort of superstitions.
And are the instructors of others.</P>
<P>The name of their Idol is <HI>Ram,</HI>
and when they salute any one with
respect, they call him by that name.
For they not only worship this sup∣pos'd
Divinity, but the rest of the
Statues, which they believe serve him;
they carry them about on sollemn
days; some have eight and some four
heads on a body, siting on a bird,
that holds a serpent in his Beeck.</P>
<P>Others squatting on their tails like
Monkies, have the head of an <HI>Elephant,</HI>
and belly of a woman; they pray to
them often, and are careful of washing
their heads with <HI>Coco</HI> water, and
rubing the rest of their bodies with
oyl.</P>
<P>If you inquire into the reason of
their sensless Superstitions and ridicu∣lous
follies they readily answer, that
they received them from their Ancest∣ors,
in whose Example they Glory
in, without the least desire of being
better inform'd.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="50"/>
The <HI>Faquirs</HI> of <HI>Ponticheri,</HI> as at o∣ther
places, are persons of no certain
body, who wander up and down
doing pennance, and that little cloath∣ing
they weare is so wretchedly poor,
they vow chastity, and voluntary po∣verty,
and when Alms is denied them,
they wound themselves, to move com∣passion.</P>
<P>As for the first Vow of Chastity, they
have little pretence to it, and the very
opinion the people have of their sanct∣ity,
is the occasion of the most loath∣some
obscenities in the Female Sex.</P>
<P>However these <HI>Faquirs</HI> impose pe∣nances
on themselves, which they in∣violably
observe as long as they live,
<HI>viz.</HI> as to have both their arms always
rais'd above their heads, one foot con∣stantly
lifted up, and a great many
other painful postures, which they
continue in to their deaths. I saw one
with his head in an Iron cage, which
he carri'd night and day on his shoul∣ders,
eating through the barrs; these
wretches, as well as others, paint their
bodies and faces of a great many dif∣ferent
colours, which makes them look
dismally.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="50"/>
Tho' their superstitious Rites are for
the most part the same, yet they wor∣ship
a great many several false Gods,
as Trees, Rivers, the Sun and Moon,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> In an Eclipse they meet by the
sea side, crying out hideously to the
noise of some instruments of brass,
bathing themselves, and believing that
as they wash themselves, they clear
and brighten the eclips'd planet. They
burn the bodies of the dead, and be∣fore
the <HI>French</HI> settled at <HI>Ponticheri,</HI>
these men's wives in proof of their con∣jugal
love and fidelity, burnt them∣selves
alive with the corps of their de∣ceas'd
husbands; but we afterwards
chang'd this custom amongst them,
and indeed 'twas no very difficult mat∣ter
to perswade them to it, being
ready enough to embrace an oppor∣tunity
of being releas'd.</P>
<P>When any one dies, they carry the
Corps on a Beer, cover'd with Callico,
and strow'd round with <HI>Bannany</HI> Leaves,
to the Place where it is to be burnt;
attended with a Mournful sound of
Trumpets, their Relations meeting
them by the way crying out, aloud
<HI>Apa,</HI> which is as much as to say, <HI>Fa∣ther;</HI>

<P>When they are near the funeral pile,
they set down the <HI>Beer,</HI> to change the
situation of the body; placing the
head where the feet were; after which,
one of the company, who never ceast
crying all the way, having washt his
hands, lays three small quantities of
Rice on the Funeral pile; and taking
four little pieces of wood, and putting
one on each hand, a third at his feet,
and a fourth at his head: He after∣wards
makes three holes in a pot full
of water, and sprinkles round the
corps three times. When they pre∣sently
take it up, and carry it to
the place where it is design'd to be
burnt.</P>
<P>Then they lay it on the Funeral
pile, the face to the wood, and the
legs crost under the belly, and after
covering it with straw and cows dung,
which they spread over it very neatly,
they set fire to it; blowing the Trum∣pet
till the Corps is quite consum'd;
<PB N="93" REF="52"/>
and the pots in which the water and
Rice was carried, they beat to pow∣der
with sticks.</P>
<P>But if the Corps is to be interr'd,
the grave is made with steps to go
down, and a rising at the bottom, on
which it is seated cross leg'd; the
relations strew flowers and ashes on't,
and then cover it with earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mallebar</HI> Christians have built
a fine vaulted Church, in which the
<HI>Missionaries</HI> of <HI>Ponticheri</HI> commonly
officiate, and where the <HI>Jesuits</HI> say
Mass; I have seen the <HI>Negros</HI> so de∣vout,
that it very much edify'd me
to see their Zeal to be so solemn and
pure.</P>
<P>Flesh is very little us'd amongst
these people, particularly here; where
they live wholly on rice and fish; they
won't eat or drink after an <HI>European;</HI>
much less tast of what he has drest,
These <HI>Malabars</HI> may marry at the age
of four or five, but then they are separ∣ated
again till eleven or twelve; when
they are permitted to dwell to∣gather.</P>
<P>While I was a shoar the marriage
of a rich merchant, who serv'd the
<PB N="94" REF="53"/>
Company, was sollemm'zd, and after
this manner; two <HI>Bambouss</HI> were plac'd
at each corner of the Fort, encompass'd
of the out side with fireworks; in the
evening he came fourth, according to
custom with his wife, in a rich <HI>Palan∣quin,</HI>
carried by twelve <HI>Negros,</HI> pre∣ceded
by two hundred Flamboys rank'd
in very good order; their nearest Re∣lations
accompany'd them a horseback,
and of all sides was continually heard
the confus'd noise of Fifes, drums
and Kettle-drums; ten or twelve dan∣cers
richly drest follow'd them, danc∣ing
from space to space to the sound
of little bells; and when the married
persons past before the <HI>Bambouss</HI>
that were prepar'd, the fire works
were lighted, which were so inter∣mix'd
with <HI>Petars</HI> and Musquets,
that they made them entertaining
enough.</P>
<P>This Solemnity having lasted a good
part of the night, they regaild them∣selves
with <HI>Bethel, Chocolet, Bannanes,</HI>
and made themselves drunk with <HI>Rack,</HI>

<P>The women, for the most part, all

black lank breasts, with nipples al∣most
as big as an Apple; they carry
their children on their hips, their legs

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The <HI>French</HI> Spuadron sails, to fight
fourteen <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English</HI> ships
that lay under the fort of <HI>Madras.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time our Ships took
in fresh water, and debark't what
was to be left at <HI>Ponticheri;</HI> and a∣mongst
the rest four Brass Guns, of 18
pounders, to strengthen the Fort, the
biggest of those it had before, being
but Twelve; and while we were re∣freshing
our selves after our long fa∣tigues,
the Commandant understood by
a Letter of Monsieur <HI>Martin's,</HI> that
there were fourteen <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English</HI>
ships ac <HI>Madras,</HI> who expected us
there, with a Resolution of fighting
us.</P>
<P>He accordingly took the best mea∣surs
he cou'd, and prepared to fight
them: Omitting nothing that might
<PB N="97" REF="54"/>
prove advantagious for the attacque:
And thereupon he presently ordered us
to turn that little vessel we had taken
off of the Isle of <HI>Ceylon</HI> into a Fire ship,
and to unring the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pink, which
after Monsieur <HI>Poureire</HI> had taken her
top mast, and plac't it in the room of
his own which was split in the Action
at <HI>Amjouam,</HI> we left her naked at
<HI>Ponticheri;</HI> from whence we departed
the <HI>24th.</HI> of <HI>August</HI> at two in the af∣ternoon,
carrying the Captain and
Lieutenant along with us prisoners.</P>
<P>In about an hours space, we saw <HI>Con∣jumelle,</HI>
a place situated by the sea side,
the sweetest on all the coast; the <HI>Dutch</HI>
having a Factory, hung out a flag
there.</P>
<P>The wind blowing fresh in the
evening, we took in some sail for fear
of coming to <HI>Madras</HI> in the night;
the passage from <HI>Ponticheri</HI> thither,
not being above 20 Leagues: so sail∣ing
gently the rest of the night, we
discover'd a ship a head of us, which
hoist sail as soon as ever she saw us;
we took it for granted she was a stout
ship, sent out by the Enemy to observe
us.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="55"/>
So we presently brought down our
hamocks, having put all the chests in
the hole, since our departure; so that
in less than half an hour we were fit∣ted
for the fight, which we the more
eagerly desir'd, because it was St.
<HI>Lewis's</HI> day.</P>
<P>And now we perceived the ships,
which seem'd to us to be rang'd in a
line under the Cannon of Fort St.
<HI>George;</HI> which is a strong and noble
one, hanging out <HI>English</HI> colours; we
had Mass said betimes, then took a
short breakfast, and after hoisting the
white Flag, and adorning the ships,
and the round tops with Flower deluce't
shields, we made all the sail we could,
till we came over against St. <HI>Thomas's,</HI>
a Town belonging to the <HI>Portugues,</HI> 2
Leagues from <HI>Madras,</HI> where formerly
stood the noblest Fort of the Coun∣try.</P>
<P>This place is remarkable for the <HI>Mar∣tyrdome</HI>
of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle,
who suffer'd here; his Sepulcher
is this day to be seen on a rising
ground hard by the Town; the shoar
was cover'd with people, who came
to be spectators of the action that was

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Combat</HI> of <HI>Madras.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE now perfectly discovered
the number of the Enemy's
ships, and their strength; I counted
fourteen, of which only eleven carry'd
Guns; that is, six <HI>Dutch,</HI> with their
Admiral, which seem'd to carry 60
guns, with a flag on the main top
mast; and five <HI>English,</HI> of which the
Admiral, who was 60 guns too, had
a flag also on the main top.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Duquesne,</HI> observing the
greatest of them anchord next to us, and
that the rest lay between them and the
Fort, hung out a flame of Orders, to
command the several Captains aboard,
to concert the manner of the attack,
and to gain the wind.</P>
<P>'Tis indeed convenient, that the
<HI>Lyon</HI> and the <HI>Dragon</HI> should coast it
from St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s to gain the wind,
and throw out a small anchor by the
<PB N="100" REF="56"/>
sides of the lesser ships, that the others
follow'd by the <HI>Rock,</HI> the <HI>Flowrishing,</HI>
and the <HI>Bird,</HI> should attack the rest;
and that while we fir'd on the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Admiral, which was our part, Mon∣sieur
<HI>d' Auberville</HI> should endeavour to
approach it with his fire ship by the
favour of the smoak. These orders
given, each took his post immediately
to execute them.</P>
<P>Never men more heartily desir'd to
come to action than ours, and we had
reason to expect an answerable succes,
and by the manner of our falling on,
our thoughts ran more on a certain
Victory, than an uncertain fight. The
<HI>Lyon</HI> and the <HI>Dragon</HI> who made all
the sail they could, were presently
within shot of the Fort, which began
to fire upon them; yet notwithstand∣ing
they past by with little or no
damage; and according to orders,
came and anchor'd over against the
ships they intended, and fir'd furiously
upon them. It might now be about
One in the afternoon, and we followed
them so close, that the enemy had
scarce answer'd them again, when we
<PB N="101" REF="56"/>
came up with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral, and
gave her a broad side.</P>
<P>'Tis not very common to see six
such ships as ours attack eleven large
ones, and to bear all their fire, and that
of a strong fort too; the least of
whose guns were twenty four and
thirty six pounders, and indeed the
fire was so terrible of both sides, that
nothing was to be seen but fire, smoak
and ball.</P>
<P>'Twas then that Monsieur <HI>d' Auber∣ville</HI>
disdaining danger, in the midst of
that shower of Ball, attempted to fire
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral; who seeing a fire
ship coming towards him, in vain endea∣vour'd
to avoid it; Monsieur <HI>d' Auber∣ville</HI>
shew'd great courage and con∣duct
in this undertaking; so having
quickly fastned the fireship to the Ad∣miral,
with chains and graples, and
set fire to it, he leapt into the boat,
which return'd safe to his ship, in
spight of all the fire of the ene∣my.</P>
<P>All expected that this undertaking
would have had the greatest succss,
and that the Admiral could not escape
being burnt; nay, the <HI>Dutch</HI> them∣selves
<PB N="102" REF="57"/>
were of that opinion, for they
presently quitted her, and got into 2
boats to make off. But unhappily the
graples (being only made of hoopes)
breaking, she fell off, and Drove a∣shoar,
consuming none but her self,
which the <HI>Dutch</HI> observing, they with
great joy return'd aboard again, from
whence they fir'd as before: The fight
still continu'd with great obstinacy, till 5
in the evening; when the Comman∣dant
gave orders to cease firing. We
had not a man kill'd, except a Valet of
a <HI>Mandarin,</HI> whose bowels were carried
away with a Cannon ball; But we
suffer'd more in our masts, which was
partly the reason we quitted them so
soon.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">After the fight, we took and burnt an
<HI>English</HI> ship in the face of the
enemy.</HEAD>
<P>HAving anchor'd about a quarter
of a League distant, where we
past the rest of the day in refitting; be∣tween
ten and eleven in the evening
we had a false alarum in our Squadron,
I don't know how; a sloop that in all
probabillity knew not what had past,
came directly to the <HI>Dragon;</HI> the seamen
on the watch discovering her, fir'd at her
which made her retire presently; how∣ever
this alarum'd the whole squadron,
which immediately had orders to be
in a readiness, and to keep a strickt
Guard all night, for fear of a surpize,
tho' the contrary winds, and the dis∣position
of the ememy was a sufficient
security against it.</P>
<P>But in affairs of war one can't be
too vigilant; for then, whatever harm
<PB N="104" REF="58"/>
happens, it cannot be imputed to folly
or neglect, however this unaccount∣able
trifle of a sloop disturb'd us all,
and depriv'd us of our rest that
night.</P>
<P>Next morning we saw the ships
lying nearer the Fort, and rang'd in a
better line then they were before.
We then perceiv'd our oversight in
not boarding them to rights at first,
by the much greater difficulty of at∣tacking
them a second time; they had
now plac't themselves at such a distance
from each other, that the Fort might
fire at us, without hurting them; a
piece of management they had neg∣lected
the day before.</P>
<P>Considering the difficulty of a se∣cond
attempt, and the uncertainty
of succeeding, we resolv'd to pursue
our course, tho' with an easy sail,
that we might give them time to fol∣us,
if they thought they could make
any thing of it, but there appear'd
not the least disposition in them; on
the contrary they fir'd several guns for
joy that they had escapt us so cheap;
but we understood afterwards that
<PB N="105" REF="58"/>
they buried some Officers, who were
kill'd in this action.</P>
<P>However we still pursued our
course under a slack sail, eying a vessel
we discover'd at anchor two Leagues
before us. The <HI>Bird,</HI> which kept a
head of the Squadron approacht within
shot of her, and sent in his sloop
arm'd, with an Officer; who found
nothing in her but such trifling things
as the <HI>English</HI> had not time to take
away, we left some men to sail her,
but she prov'd so slow, that we chose ra¦ther
to set her a fire than to be troubled
with her, which he did, (after tak∣ing
out of her whatever might be of
any use) not far from a <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory,
nam'd <HI>Pailliacat,</HI> and in the sight of

<P>WE afterwards lancht out into

lost the sight of <HI>Masilipatam,</HI> where
they make the finest painted Calico's
in all the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the most vallu'd
in <HI>Europe;</HI> after some days, having
regain'd the Coast, the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>August,</HI>
in the morning we perceiv'd a Vessel
near the shoar without a Top-mast;
tho' we made towards her with <HI>Dutch</HI>
colours, yet she hung out none, and
we observ'd that she had not so much
as a flag staff, which made us believe
she was a <HI>Moor,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI>
being farther convinc't of it by her
building presently tackt about, and
stood away.</P>
<P>Next day, being the last of this
month, we discover'd another about
three in the afternoon, which present∣ly
<PB N="107" REF="59"/>
hoisted sail, and fir'd several Guns at
her departure, we presently made all
the sail we could after her, and gave
the chase signal to the <HI>Lyon,</HI> and the
<HI>Dragon,</HI> who gaining the wind, got
between her and the shoar, to prevent
her runing her self a ground; the rest
of us kept under the wind to inter∣cept
her course; but notwithstanding
she being far a head of us, and mak∣ing
all the sail she could, ran herself
aground at a place call'd <HI>Cangam,</HI> near
a River which bears that name, be∣fore
we could come within shot of
her.</P>
<P>It was now too late to attacque her,
or so much as to perceive how she
lay; in this uncertainty we anchor'd
so, that she could not escape us with∣out
being seen, and in the Morning,
Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> sent Monsieur <HI>de la
Neufville,</HI> second Captain of the <HI>Bird,</HI>
to view her with all the sloops.</P>
<P>This little Squadron of arm'd sloops,
as is necessary on such an Expediti∣on,
quickly reacht the place, where
that change of waters is observ'd,
which is caus'd in the sea by the over∣flowing
of this River; we now began
<PB N="108" REF="60"/>
to sound; by reason of a vast number
of little rocks that lay under water
here abouts, beyond which this ship
had run her self aground; we went
two fathom and a half water, with∣out
being able to come near her; so
that we could not immagin, how 'twas
possible for the Vessel to get so far
in.</P>
<P>About a quarter of an hour after,
we saw a topmast floating on the side
of the ebb, with seven seamen cling∣ing
to it, who were half drown'd, and
who by signs, of Crosses, desir'd us
to save them; Monsieur <HI>de la Neuf∣ville</HI>
going towards them took them
up in his boat, where they no sooner
were, but the seamen fell a rifling
these miserable people, for the money
they had hid in the wast bands of
their breeches. They were, <HI>Portuguese,</HI>
who inform'd us, that 'twas an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
ship of 36 guns coming from <HI>Mas∣silipatam,</HI>
that from the time she was
run aground, the Captain debarkt with
40000 Roupies in silver, which is
20000 crowns <HI>French,</HI> and her richest
lading that could be best carried
off: That the <HI>English,</HI> who were but
<PB N="109" REF="60"/>
fifteen, sav'd themselves a shoar,
except two or three, whom we saw
on the deck; adding also, that they
themselves had made the same shift, in
order or get a shoar, bnt the tide of
ebb instead of landing them, carried
them farther out to Sea.</P>
<P>We saw her struck at one end, and
so we judg'd, there could not be above
three foot water where she was; the
vast surges that roll all along on this
coast, went over her stern, so that in
the condition she lay, there seem'd to
be little likely hood of getting her off,
but by pieces. They ask't the <HI>Portu∣guess</HI>
if the sloops could come at her
without danger, they answer'd, that we
must steer directly towards her Stern,
But Monsieur <HI>de la Neufelle</HI> not judg∣ing
it so easy a matter, resolv'd to
run no such hazards on the bare word
of Strangers, in an enterprize, which
in the opinion of every one, would
have succeeded better than he expect∣ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negros</HI> appear'd thick on the
shoar, to see what we would do; both
the <HI>English</HI> and they expected to see
the ship pillag'd or burnt; but they were
<PB N="110" REF="61"/>
not a little pleas'd with their mistake,
when they saw our sloops tacking and
going off again, accompanied with
great rains. We were afterwards in∣form'd
that there was aboard a great

avoids being burnt.</HEAD>
<P>THE calm hinder'd our departure
this day, but the next being the
2d. of <HI>Sep.</HI> we sail'd with a fresh gale
that just began to blow. The two fol∣lowing
days we discover'd another ship,
and presently made what sail we could
after her; sometimes, she made to∣wards
the land, as if she intended to
run a shoat; then she would tack, and
stand out to sea, as if she did not
<PB N="111" REF="61"/>
know what course to take. At last
seeing the <HI>Lyon</HI> and the <HI>Dragon</HI> ready
to come up with her, after some hours
chase, she struck her topmast, which
she would have hoisted again immedi∣ately;
the <HI>Dragon</HI> hanging out a
white flag, fir'd a gun at her, which
oblig'd her to ly by, till the Admiral
came up.</P>
<P>She prov'd a <HI>Moorish</HI> ship, bound
from the <HI>Maldive</HI> Islands, laden with
<HI>Coris</HI>'s, which are certain shells that
pass for small mony at several places,
as <HI>Bengale, Siam</HI> and <HI>Guinne.</HI> We sail'd
together almost to <HI>Balazor,</HI> where we
arriv'd later than we expected, by
reason of the calms we met; however
on the seventh we came in sight of it
at 4 in the evening.</P>
<P>Two <HI>English</HI> Vessels which lay in
the road as soon as ever they saw us
at a distance, presently hoist sail;
thinking it better to quit the place
than to expect us, tho' they were
secure enough; the <HI>Great Mogull</HI> on
whom this Country is dependant,
suffering no vessel to be attackt in 8
fathom water. They made towards
the mouth of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> to anchor
<PB N="112" REF="62"/>
at a good distance from us; expecting
as they said, a Convoy of twelve
ships, because they were richly laden
with Coupans and gold ingots from
<HI>Japan;</HI> but we had the wind so scan∣ty,
that they could hardly fly, or we
pursue, but we observ'd we were the
better sailors, for when they came to
an anchor, we were within two cables
length of them.</P>
<P>The Commandant order'd three
guns to be fir'd, to give the Director
of the <HI>French</HI> Factory notice of our
arrival, and sent his sloop to <HI>Balazor</HI>
next day for fresh provisions, which
did not return again in three days,
being no less than seven Leagues
by Land. Monsieur <HI>Pele</HI> the Direct∣or,
and several other Merchants came
aboard, who brought two ships laden
with provisions with them, which by
reason of the wind, were oblieg'd to an∣chor
at two Leagues distance from us till
it chang'd, but there appearing no like∣ly
hood of it, we went and joyn'd them.</P>
<P>He receiv'd us with a flag, and one
of them saluted us with seven guns.
The fresh provisions were distributed
amongst the ships of the Squadron,
of which we stood in great need, for
<PB N="113" REF="62"/>
we were half famisht. Monsieur <HI>Du∣quesne</HI>
writ to Monsieur <HI>Deslandes,</HI> Di∣rector
general, who commonly re∣sides
at <HI>Ougly,</HI> a Town situated on the
bank of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> fifty Leagues from
<HI>Balazor;</HI> to make ready two thousand
sacks of Biscuit, with the Merchandize
that was to be transported to <HI>France</HI>
against the <HI>15th.</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> when
he expected to return.</P>
<P>The same day about two in the
afternoon, we had the saddest alarum
that cou'd happen aboard, a fire be∣gan
in the <HI>Lyons</HI> room through the neg∣ligence
of the Mate, but the Counter∣master
happening by good providence
to be a sleep there, suddainly wak't and
cry'd Fire, every one scar'd and ala∣rum'd,
run to draw water, and to
wet linen cloaths to extinguish it;
it had already reacht the cable room,
but we follow'd it so close, and took
such care, that it did little damage.</P>
<P>About three days before, and I
know not for what reason, (which
ought to make us admire and thank
the Divine Providence the more) we
remov'd the powder out of the <HI>Lyons</HI>
hold, (which is put there in times of
<PB N="114" REF="63"/>
action,) and that very happily; for if
it had continued there, the forecastle
blowing up; we should have had but
little time to have sav'd our selves in

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Squadron leaves <HI>Balazor</HI> for
<HI>Mergui,</HI> which we could not

<P>THE <HI>13th.</HI> of <HI>September</HI> we part∣ed
from <HI>Balazor</HI> for <HI>Mergui,</HI> we
had little wind that day, and a calm
at night; so that after having several
times weigh'd and cast anchor in vain,
we were forc'd to make use of the
Currents, and to drive with the tide
when it serv'd us.</P>
<P>On the <HI>18th.</HI> at night there hap∣pen'd
an Eclipse of the Moon, which
lasted from seven, till thirty Minutes
past nine, a third part was darkned;
I believe neither this nor that I men∣tioned
<PB N="115" REF="63"/>
before, were seen in <HI>France;</HI> for
'twas about two in the afternoon when
we saw it there.</P>
<P>'Till this day we were still troubled
with weighing and casting anchor
continually: The <HI>29th.</HI> in the even∣ing
this long calm chang'd into a vio∣lent
storm, that after loosing two an∣chors
we were oblieg'd to hoist sail
tho' the wind was against us; the
storm encreast so, that about midnight
we thought we should a lost all our
Masts.</P>
<P>In the morning we saw none of our
ships but the <HI>Bird,</HI> the tempest hav∣ing
separated the rest. The Rende∣vouzse
was to be at <HI>Negraille,</HI> in case
we could not make <HI>Mergui</HI> our port,
for which, the wind was quite contrary,
and so violently accompanied with
hail, that we `struck our top sails
three or four times a day; being
fearful we should want water if this
weather lasted, and tho' we had sup∣plied
our selves for six months at
<HI>Ponticheri,</HI> we had so wasted it, that
we had not enough for one month.
Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> began to manage it
with care retrenching the Rice, which
<PB N="116" REF="64"/>
consum'd a great deal of it, and or∣der'd
Biscuit in its place, and stinted
the whole Company to a pint a
day.</P>
<P>I never was more sensible of the
violence of thirst; the salt Victuals, and
the Extream heats had almost parcht
me up, once in the extremity of this
suffering, I offer'd five Crowns for a
pot of water, but cou'd find none that
would accept of it, each labouring un∣der
the same evil, so that there was
no remedy but patience, which is but
a small relief to him that is stinted
by nature.</P>
<P>At length the wind chang'd, and
continued good for five or six days,
in which we recover'd what we had
lost of our way; But it becoming
changeable again, we sail'd sometimes
losing, sometimes gaining, without
hopes of seeing <HI>Mergui</HI> so soon as we
expected, which very much afflicted
us.</P>
<P>The last of <HI>September</HI> in the morn∣ing,
we discover'd a sail a head of us,
steering the same course; we made
what hast we could to know what she
was, and after three hours chase, we
<PB N="117" REF="64"/>
came within shot of her, who hung
out a flag all red; we hung out ours,
which they saluted by hoisting their
topmast three times for want of guns.
Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> sent his sloop to
bring the Captain aboard, who shew'd
him a Pass-port sign'd by Monsieur
<HI>Martin;</HI> he was accompanied by three
old men like himself, clad in <HI>Muslin</HI>
Shirts, and <HI>Turbants</HI> on their heads,
and each a long beard, they were rich
<HI>Moorish</HI> Merchants, bound from <HI>Mas∣silipatam</HI>
for <HI>Mergui:</HI> they had a flag
all red by way of distinction, and to
shew they were more than ordinany;
for the common flag of the <HI>Moors,</HI> is
no more than a cimiter crost with its
scabard on a red ground. We regail'd
them with wine, <HI>Tea,</HI> and sweetmeats,
and after viewing exactly and admir∣ing
our ship, they departed without
selling any of their goods, which they
held at too dear a rate. Next day
we lost sight of them.</P>
<P>The fifth of <HI>October,</HI> discovering
another ship we steer'd towards her
for some time, believing she was one
of our Squadron, of whom as yet we
had heard no news since we were se∣parated
<PB N="118" REF="65"/>
at <HI>Balazor;</HI> but as she made
off with all the sail she could, and
that 'twould have carried us too far
out of our way to have persu'd the
Chase, we quitted her, to make our
best advantage of the little wind we
had; it never was so changeable, for
if it favour'd us for a day, 'twas a
calm again at night, or perhaps con∣trary
for four or five days after; in the
mean time the water in the hold was
very much diminisht, and our thirst
encreast more and more with that little
we drank of it at meals, and the vio∣lent

<P>AN hour after discovering the Isles

of the <HI>Coco's,</HI> which we endeavour'd to
gain, that we might take in water at
any rate: We had the wind almost
quite against us, but in such extrea∣mities
<PB N="121" REF="66"/>
as these, the utmost was to be
try'd, for fear of missing them, and
tho' they were in sight of us, yet we
several times lost hopes of gaining
them, in the mean time we tack'd so of∣ten,
that on <HI>Sunday</HI> the <HI>15th.</HI> at 3 in the
afternoon we anchor'd on a little
Island which lay South-East and by
South of us, bord'ring to the South
East of all the rest, but plac'd wrong in
the <HI>Carde.</HI> We observ'd it to lie in 14
Deg. N. L. of one side; at about two
Leagues distance from it there is
larger Islands, which lay to the East of
us.</P>
<P>The Commandant sent the sloop
arm'd a shoar, in case they should hin∣der
their landing; but none opposing
it, they ransak't the whole Island with
all the eagerness and nicey, as such
violent thirst could inspire them with,
without being able to discover
spring or river, and consequently
any Inhabitants; they past the night
easy enough, by reason of the abun∣dance
of <HI>Cocos</HI> they met with, which
supplied the defect of water, of which
they brought us the boat full next day,
and two Lizards of a prodigious
<PB N="122" REF="67"/>
length, with three <HI>Tortoises</HI>'s, one of
which was big enough two make two
meals for the whole Crew; but as it
was not that we wanted most, Mon∣sieur
<HI>Duquesne</HI> sent the sloop presently
to the other Island, ordering the Officer
if he met with water, to give notice
of it by a signal of two fires.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bird</HI> which could not get so
near the wind as we, lay at a Loofe,
and therefore could not come at an
anchor with us, till four in the after∣noon,
in the morning <HI>Chavilier Dair</HI>
came aboard us, as well to know our
necessities, as to inform us of his own;
for he told us we wanted not only
Water, but meat for his Table. Mon∣sieur
<HI>Duquesne</HI> reflecting on the miser∣able
condition the last Tempest had
brought them too, the Dangers they
had run, and those they shou'd be ex∣pos'd
too, in case they attempted to
gain <HI>Merguy</HI> while the wind was con∣trary:
He resolved therefore, in case
there was no Water in that great
Island, to Steer his course directly to
<HI>Negraille,</HI> it being a place design'd for
our Rendezvouze, and winter Quar∣ters,
if we were not able to reach
<PB N="123" REF="67"/>
<HI>Merguy,</HI> or force the <HI>Siamoi</HI>'s to enter∣tain
us.</P>
<P>About Two in the afternoon, we
saw the sloop returning, and presently
we hoist sail and met her, in order to
take our measures, according to the
news she brought us; which indeed
was such, as could not be more Wel∣com
than in our present distress: Our
Company was all on the Deck to see
the sloop returning loaden, tho' yet
uncertain with what, shouted for joy;
they askt what she brought, and be∣ing
answer'd, Water, at that word im∣mediately
all our trouble were dis∣pers'd,
by this pleasing draught, of
which we drunk unmeasurably; and
then anchor'd with satisfaction near
the great Isle, about a League from

<P>WE would not loose a moment
of time in going a shour;
where we loaded fifty tun of water
and wood, tho' not without great toil,
<PB N="124" REF="68"/>
by reason of the landing, which is
very troublesom at low water. The
sloops being obliged to anchor at
large, we were forc'd to go up to the
Neck in the Water, to get a shoar;
by reason of the vast number of small
Rocks that inviron this Isle.</P>
<P>They who admire shell-work, may
glut their fancy here; for the strand
is cover'd or'e with the most beautiful
shells that can be seen. The Island
produces no pallatable fruit but <HI>Cocos,</HI>
the vast plenty of which was very
benificial to me, and some others,
whose curiosity had oblig'd us to lie
in a part of the Island where there is
no sweet Water to be had; we kindled
a great fire, and past the whole night
by it, eating and drinking <HI>Cocos;</HI> not
being able to sleep, by reason of the
<HI>Maraingevins,</HI> that continually stung
us; they are little flies, like those they
call <HI>Cousins</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> But much
more troublesom and pernicious, they
appearing only in the night.</P>
<P>Every one will justly wonder, that
the same fruit should yeild both heat
and drink, yet such is the <HI>Coco;</HI> the
tree is lofty, Crooked at the Foot
<PB N="125" REF="68"/>
like the <HI>Pinetree,</HI> its branches are ga∣ther'd
at top; the fruit is commonly
as big as ones head, the bark being
so exceeding thick, you cannot find the
<HI>Coco</HI> till you have stript it, at the end
there's a hole, which you no sooner
touch with your knife but there spurts
out a clear water, very sweet, and re∣freshing;
they are of a small size in
this Island, but I remember at <HI>Moelly</HI>
they were so large, that three of us
could scarse deal with one of them:
You must split the <HI>Coco</HI> to get at the
Kernell, which is white and about the
thickness of your finger, and tastes al∣most
like a hasel-nut; of all fruits this
is perhaps the most useful; the <HI>Indians</HI>
besides meat and drink, draw a certain
oyl from it, into which the Water
turns after it has stood sometime;
they make bowls, and cups, of the shells
and ropes, and Tow of the bark, to
bind and caulk their boats with.</P>
<P>This Island is nothing near so steep
as others I have seen, but then 'ts so
wooded with high trees, that it is
one impenetrable forest all over; be∣sides
a great many curious and un∣known
birds, we saw <HI>Lizards</HI> of 5 or
<PB N="126" REF="69"/>
6 foot long, and as thick as a Mans
leg; whose deep mouths were set with
teeth as dangerous, as their claws are
with talons, however they fled at the
sight of us, and do no harm if not at∣tackt;
their flesh is wonderful white,
and some of our men eat of it, and
found it good.</P>
<P>It is stock'd with different sorts of
Insects; amongst the rest there's one
very little Annimal which seems to be
all legs, very remarkable by their
various colours, and a pretty shell
on their backs. There's another
creature of the shape of a serpent,
which I have often heard cry distinctly
in the trees; <HI>Tocquets,</HI> so being igno∣rant
of its other Qualities, we call'd it
by that name, as none of us saw any Fal∣low
Deer while we were here, I believe
the place is scarce fit for them, and
much less for the habitations of men,
for I believe it never was inhabited.
'Tis true, that in the Eastern part of
the Isle, I observ'd two little hills,
whose seeming fertility, together with
the beautiful verdure of a Meadow at
the bottom, inclin'd me to believe
<PB N="127" REF="69"/>
there might be some cattel feeding
thereabouts, tho' I saw none,</P>
<P>We arriv'd here <HI>Tuesday</HI> the <HI>17th.</HI>
and departed <HI>Saturday</HI> the <HI>21st.</HI> of
<HI>Octtober</HI> at 8 in the morning for <HI>Ne∣graile,</HI>
or rather for <HI>Mergui,</HI> if the

so that 'twas the day following before
we reach'd a certain Island that lies
ten Leagues distant from the <HI>Cocos,</HI>
and in 14 D. N. 50 Min. Lat. it has
a chain of rocks that runs a matter of

number of <HI>Crocodils,</HI> call'd <HI>Caymans,</HI>
who in the day time hide themselves
in rivers, the better to surprize the
beasts when they come to drink;
this subtile creature fastning on the
nose of the Wild Oxen, draws them
in, and after drownding them eats
them.</P>
<P>At the little Island where we took
in Water and Wood, are seen two
spacious and beautiful plains, cover'd
with good feeding, in which the sight
loses it self: Through the midst of it,
a pleasant river takes its Course; whose
Water is exceeding good, and easiy
to be come at; there we bath'd our
selves almost every hour in the day,
under the thick shady trees, and in
<PB N="135" REF="74"/>
large and greedy draughts, quencht
the violence of our raging thirst.</P>
<P>All this place is marshy, and in
many places with salt water; yet in
the woods there are places where they
don't reach, and where there is sweet
water always to be found; which the
beasts drink of, who come thither in
troops of a hunderd at a time, and
feed quietly together; without fear of
being disturb'd by the Huntsman.</P>
<P>One of my companions and I go∣ing
a hunting, we follow'd some
Harts and Hinds very warmly, which
carried us further into the wood than
we were aware of; so that after two
hours pursuit, being quite tir'd, and
intending to return back again, 'twas
more than we could do, to find our
way, tho' we still flattered our selves
with hopes; but after long trying in
vain, we at last began to despair, and
almost to give our selves for lost; be∣ing
already over-power'd with hun∣ger
thirst and weariness.</P>
<P>We past through a great many
Thickets, the paths being only beaten
by the wild beasts; the sight of whom
diverted our melancholy wanderings
<PB N="136" REF="75"/>
in a desart Island, destitute of all Sub∣sistance;
expos'd to Tygers, Wild-Oxen
and Serpents; in this sad con∣dition,
knowing not what to do, we
adrest our selves to God; and took
observations of the Sun; Steering our
course by it. So after much labour
and fatigue, and beating about from
four in the morning to 4 in the even∣ing,
we at length discover'd the plain
in which our Companions were en∣camp'd;
from whence we went to our
tent, rejoycing that we were not
oblieg'd to lie in the woods, that
night.</P>
<P>These two Isles differ but little, save
only this, that the greatest, nou∣rishes
a great many <HI>Tygers,</HI> and greater
variety of strange creaturs then the
less, where the conveniency of water,
and the beautiful walks renders it
very happy and proper for human
habitation. The Hunters had so di∣sturb'd
these wild Inhabitants, that the
Oxen, whose calves, they every day
kill'd; became so furious, that the
Femals ran at all they met.</P>
<P>A Captain of the <HI>Marines</HI> belonging
to the <HI>Bird,</HI> being a hunting with 2
<PB N="137" REF="75"/>
others, was set upon by one of these
creaturs; she broke his leg, and tore
out his bowels, while he was climb∣ing
up a tree to save himself; this
spectacle so frighten'd his companions,
that instead of shooting at her, they
fled and left him expos'd to her fury;
but however they went back after∣wards
and took him up half dead,
bringing him to the Tent; whom we
were oblieg'd to leave at <HI>Pontichery,</HI>
his wounds and bruises, not permit∣ting
him to return to <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P>WHile we were taking in Water,

ketch, that came to take some
<HI>Tortoises</HI> before she went to <HI>Pegu;</HI>
the <HI>Dragon</HI> joyn'd her a little after,
so these two Frigats lay cruising out
till the twelfth of <HI>November,</HI> when we
sail'd out from between the two Isles
of <HI>Negraile,</HI> to be the readier to sail
when the wind should present.</P>
<P>We had no sooner anchor'd again
over against the <HI>Diamond,</HI> but Mon∣sieur
<HI>Duquesne</HI> sent for the Captain of
the ketch aboard; he was a <HI>Genoese</HI>
by nation, and 'twas from him we
understood the enemy reported they
had kill'd two hundred of us in the
fight off <HI>Madras,</HI> and fourscore
of our Officers, of whom were Mon∣sieur
<HI>Duquesne</HI> himself, and <HI>Father Tach∣ard;</HI>
whom we buried in the night at
St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s; we were not a little sur∣priz'd
at this news, for what likeli∣hood
was there of <HI>Father Tachards</HI>
being kil'd, who all the time of the
fight was in the hold, and so could
not be lost, unless the ship sunk; and
<PB N="139" REF="76"/>
how was it possible, for us to lose
fourscore Officers out of thirty, which
was the whole number we brought
out of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>However a report attended with
such particulars, did not fail to gain
belief every where; and they man∣ag'd
it so, that at <HI>Ponticheri</HI> it past
for a certain, truth; and all along the
coast, none knevv the contrary, but
themselves; vvho vvere so far from be∣lieving
it, that they could not con∣ceal
that they were more afraid of us
than ever; the best part of them re∣moving
with their best effects from
<HI>Madras,</HI> for fear we should return and
make a descent: And this did not look
like the security, and triumph of
Victors.</P>
<P>Yet this boasted Victory, serv'd till
our return, to conceal the disgrace of
having eleven large ships, under the
protection of a Fort, insulted by a
Squadron of six; I can't imagin
what people will think of them, when
they see Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> reviv'd
again, and the fourscore Officers rais'd
from tht dead; and our whole Com∣pany
<PB N="140" REF="77"/>
as Compleat as before, except∣ing
only four that were kil'd.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> the fourteenth of <HI>November,</HI>
having taken about fourscore <HI>Tortoises,</HI>
we sail'd for <HI>Balazor.</HI> That day a
Seaman of <HI>Provence</HI> deserted us, who
enrag'd, because he could not revenge
himself for some hard usage he thought
he had receiv'd from his Officers, re∣main'd
at the great Isle of <HI>Negraille;</HI>
whither we had sent the sloop in the
morning to look for our men that had
been a hunting since the day before;
without taking any other provision,
but a little <HI>Rack</HI> and some <HI>Biscuit</HI> in
his Pocket, a hatchet, and three great
nails; in all probability to make a
<HI>Catamaron</HI> with, in which by the
favour of the tide, he might gain the
Country of <HI>Pegu,</HI> which was but
four Leagues distant.</P>
<P>Scarce had we lost sight of <HI>Negraile,</HI>
but the little wind we had, turn'd into
a downright calm; which lasted a long
while, and was very Tiresom by rea∣son
of the violent heats, and a malig∣nant
Fever that began to spread
amongst the Seamen; which we with
reasnn attributed to the extraordinary
<PB N="141" REF="77"/>
fatigues they had gone through, and
to the pestilential serenes of these
Marshy Islands, which are damp, un∣wholesome
Vapors rising after Sun-set;
and the whole Crew, that before en∣joy'd
so perfect a health, became ve∣ry
much infected; so that Monsieur
<HI>Duquesne</HI> through a necessity of being
supply'd with fresh provisions was
oblieg'd to stop at <HI>Cheduba,</HI> an Island
in the Kingdom of <HI>Racam,</HI> situated in
18 Deg. 23 Min. N. L. and 115 D.
34 M. L. where we say for a while,
and sent three sloops ashoar.</P>
<P>As soon as ever these fearful
Islanders perceiv'd them, they fled to
the woods; there came a band of them
afterwards to the sea side with <HI>Lances</HI>
and <HI>Bows</HI> in their hands, making signs
that we should not Land; notwith∣standing
which two of our men did,
(and put them out of pain,) by letting
them understand as well as they could
the reason of it; but 'twas impossible
to perswade these savages to supply
us with any fresh provisions for our
mony, or by the way of exchange,
tho' they had plenty of Fowl and Cat∣tel.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="78"/>
They are of a swarthy complection,
and go naked; have very thick hair,
and are taller than ordinary. 'Twas
no small mortification to fail of being
supplied with those Provisions and
necessaries we expected to meet with
here; our distemper encreasing daily,
and having scarce fresh provisions
enough to serve the sick, the number
of whom by this time amounted to
60, and 'twas not long before I was
one of them, but was so happy as to
have but six fits of the Fever.</P>

<P>WHatever care we could take to
mannage our fesh provisions,
the number of the sick soon consum'd
them; so we were forc'd to have re∣course
to Monsieur <HI>Duquesne,</HI> who
<PB N="143" REF="78"/>
at the instance of Father <HI>Tachar'd</HI>
stinted himself of his own, to supply
them, who else had perish'd through
Want.</P>
<P>I can't hear omit the indefatigable
pains this good Father took with them;
he toil'd with the <HI>Almoner</HI> from morn∣ing
till night, visiting some, serving
others, and administering the Sacra∣ments
to the dying, and performing
the utmost that lay in his power.
What the Commandant spar'd, prov'd
but inconsiderable, when divided a∣mongst
fourscore sick persons, who
yet were glad of it till they got to
<HI>Balazor,</HI> to the sight of which we came
the last of <HI>November</HI> in the morning;
we sail'd four days along the coast, and
the banks of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> which is
one of the four principal Rivers of the
World; and on the third of <HI>December,</HI>
we came to an anchor within three
Leagues and a half of the Land, where
after firing three guns of notice, as the
first time, the Commandant sent Mon∣sieur
<HI>Fauche</HI> to give notice of his ar∣rival.</P>
<P>We presently prepar'd to set a shoar
at the mouth of the River, those, who
<PB N="144" REF="79"/>
had the disease of the Country, and to
get fresh provisions aboard for the rest
of the sick; the number of whom was
too great to let the <HI>English</HI> know of it,
who had a Factory too at <HI>Balazor,</HI>
and might make their advantages of it.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Deslandes,</HI> Director gen∣eral,
arriv'd from <HI>Ougly.</HI> 2 days after;
almost at the same time as the <HI>Mer∣gui,</HI>
an <HI>English</HI> built ship of 18 guns,
with two others, that the <HI>French</HI> took
from the <HI>Siamois,</HI> which were partly
laden with Salt-peter, and some bales
of goods, that were to be put aboard
the Squadron; we unloaded 'em out
of hand, and several other great Barks,
who every day brought us the rest
of the goods; while we were loading,
Monsieur <HI>Deslandes</HI> continued a board
us, whom the Commandant entertain'd
very nobly, and honour'd him several
times with the discharge of guns, as well
from his own ship, as the rest, who
complimented him thus in their Turns.</P>
<P>We were very ill furnisht with fresh
provisions here; the beef and mutton
was meer carrion, so that two of the
Captains who were careful of the
health of their men, threw, what fell to
<PB N="145" REF="79"/>
their share over-board; I never saw
any flesh so red, or so likely to pro∣cure
a flux; however our Captain
who did not much concern himself
with such things, and the violence of
hunger, made us digest them with
rice, which was now our bread for four
months.</P>
<P>This fare was none of the best, and
I long'd to go to <HI>Balazor</HI> to mend
my diet, but could not get leave,
by reason that at our first landing
there were some of the Seamen who
got drunk with <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and quarrell'd
with the <HI>English,</HI> one of vvhom they
kill'd with a knife, which was the oc∣casion
of hindring the others going a
shoar, without so much as excepting
some of us, who were not given to
such kind of quarrels.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Mandarins</HI> being gone to
<HI>Balazor,</HI> to Inquire out a convenient
passage to their Country, understood
that them was a <HI>Moorish</HI> ship bound
suddainly for <HI>Mergui,</HI> they agreed pre∣sently
for their passage with the Cap∣tain,
and afterwards came to take
their leave of Monsieur <HI>Duquesne,</HI> and
Father <HI>Tachard,</HI> who was glad to be
<PB N="146" REF="80"/>
rid of the burthen; The Father who
had them under his protection, and
who was in honor oblieg'd to see them
us'd respectfully, having receiv'd them
from the hand of the late King of <HI>Siam;</HI>
procur'd from Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> a
Compliment, to dismiss them with
five guns.</P>
<P>We recommended to them the mi∣erable
state of the <HI>French</HI> who languisht
in their prisons, and Monsieur <HI>Chamo∣reau,</HI>
Captain of the <HI>Lyon,</HI> besought
them in particular, in the behalf of a
Brother of his, who was actually a
prisoner there, tho' to be plain with
them, I believe their interest was very
inconsiderable: And if I may believe
the account a Jesuite gave me of them,
'twould be as much as they could do
to keep their own feet out of the fet∣ters,
when they came home.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Duchast,</HI> whom a long Re∣sidence
in <HI>Siam,</HI> had render'd him
knowing in the <HI>Maxims</HI> and policies
of this Nation, arriv'd at <HI>Ougli,</HI> and
came to salute Father <HI>Tachard,</HI> and to
put into his hands a great quantity of
provisions, which the Jesuits of this
Town sent to those of <HI>Ponticheri;</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="80"/>
after he had put them aboard us, he
he return'd very well pleas'd with his
Voyage, and us too; for he was so civil
as to let us have all the curious stuffs
he had brought from <HI>Ougly</HI> at reason∣able
rates. Monsieur <HI>Vasseur,</HI> second

<P>THe near approach of an ill Sea∣son;
but cheifly the earnest de∣sire
of Monsieur <HI>Duquesne,</HI> to return to
<HI>France,</HI> made us hasten our departure;
after having taken in fresh Water, and all
other supplies necessary for our Voyage,
we commanded our sick aboard, whom
the land Air had perfectly recover'd.
<PB N="148" REF="81"/>
And on <HI>Saturday</HI> the <HI>30th.</HI> of <HI>Decem∣ber,</HI>
we parted with Monsieur <HI>Deslandes</HI>
for <HI>Pontichery,</HI> being follow'd by the
Company's boat loaden with powder
and ball for the Fort.</P>
<P>We took our course South East and
by South, with a fresh gale, which
soon turn'd into a calm; and lasted
from the first, to the fifth of <HI>January,</HI>
1691. When it began to blow a fresh
again; and on the tenth in the evening,
we discover'd the land of <HI>Madras;</HI> at
which the Commandant lay by, for
fear of passing beyond it in the night,
resolving to stop there the next day, if
he discover'd any shiping, tho' the
fright and consternation the enemy was
in, gave us little ground to expect it;
yet nevertheless we met one, whom
the fort had no sooner warn'd of our
arrival by six guns, but she fled; not
believing it a sufficient protection.</P>
<P>We follow'd her with all the sail
we could make, and at last came up
with her, notwithstanding she had
been so far a head of us; about four
in the afternoon seeing the <HI>Lyon</HI> and
the <HI>Dragon</HI> within shot of her, she run
herself within a little bank at <HI>Sadras∣patam,</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="81"/>
where her men presently went
a shoar. But in vain had she sought
for safety there, if the sea, which was
very ruff, had not hinder'd us from
boarding her; yet we earnestly de∣sier'd
it, being ready to run any
riskque in the pillageing and burning
of her, but Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> judging
otherwise of it, pursued his Voyage,
and this evening came to an anchor
some Leagues beyond <HI>Madras,</HI> from
whence we departed next morning
being the twelfth, and arriv'd at <HI>Pon∣tichery</HI>
at one in the afternoon; the
Fort saluted us with nine Guns, and
we answer'd them with as many:
Father <HI>Tachand</HI> went a shoar pre∣sently,
taking with him what he had
aboard, intending to make his residence
there.</P>
<P>I could not immagine that the loss
of his Reverence, could produce such
different effects as it did; there were
some who were very much afflicted at
it▪ and a great many others, who of
the contrary were very little con∣cern'd:
and most of the Seamen, who
are little verst in the merits, and worth
of Men, were as incensible of the loss
<PB N="150" REF="82"/>
of him, as if they had never enjoy'd
the advantages of his company; how∣ever
he wanted not the civility of
seven Guns at his departure.</P>
<P>The Publick is like to be oblieg'd
to him for an account of his Voyage,
which at parting he put into the hands
of Monsieur <HI>Duquesne,</HI> to deliver it to the
RR. FF. Jesuites, who were to see it
printed, but it contains no return; I
read nothing in it which I had not
seen, and which I have not inserted in
this; except a letter from one of their
Fathers, who is at present in <HI>China;</HI>
which contains a full account of the
Revolution that happen'd at <HI>Siam,</HI>
and this has very much enlarg'd his
Relation.</P>
<P>Since our departure from <HI>Pontichery,</HI>
they had planted on the shoar a new
battery of eight Guns, 18 pounder
each, being those we had brought
from <HI>France;</HI> and we found above
twenty thousand <HI>Negros</HI> there, who
had fled thither for refuge, under the
<HI>French Pavillion,</HI> to avoid the Troops
of the <HI>Great Mogul;</HI> who had besieg'd
<HI>Gingy,</HI> the Caputal of the Prince of
that Name.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="82"/>
This is a very great Town, about
fifteen Leagues up the land; the
strongest, and the only one, able to
resist the power of the <HI>Mogul;</HI> with
whom this Prince has continual war:
And whose Troops, tho' to the num∣ber
of fourscore thousand, where, as
they told us, shamefully oblieg'd to
quit the Siege, through the vigorus
resistance of the Garison and the Town,
where the Prince of <HI>Gingy</HI> commanded
in person.</P>
<P>Two great Lords of the Country
who where at <HI>Pontichery</HI> when we lay
at anchor, had the curiosity to come
and see our ship, accompanied with
five and twenty servants, which they
took out of above three hundred, that
each of them had; we put all things
in as good order as we could, and
brought all our Company above Deck,
the number of which they admir'd at;
but the Sea incommoding them very
much, and not being able to stand on
the deck, they returned immediately;

before.</P>
<P>The <HI>16th.</HI> We had the sun in our
Zeinth, that is, darting his Beams
perpendicularly on us, casting no sha∣dow,
but on the contrary an excessive
heat, which we were forc'd to bear,
without so much as one drop of Water
to refresh us between meals; this

<P>BEing now the time of <HI>Carnevall,</HI>
Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> was obliged

Morning and Evening, and were ve∣ry
merry; which joyn'd with the fair
wind we had, serv'd to lessen the time,
which was more irksom to us, than any
thing else.</P>
<P>The Wind already blew so strong,
that we sail'd no less than 3 Leagues
an hour; and encreasing on <HI>Tuesday</HI>
the <HI>1st.</HI> of March, obleig'd us to furl
all our Sails, except the fore-mast; and
the air was so thick and Cloudy, that
we cou'd scarce descern from Ship to
Ship, which prov'd but too Fatal an
Omen, of that dreadful Tempest that
ensu'd. Sure nothing cou'd be more
Frightful and amazing, than to see
the air condens'd, and our beloved
Element representing a dismal scene of
Death. The Winds spent their ut∣most
rage, and seem'd to groan be∣neath
their Burthen; while the yawn∣ing
seas torn with their fury, eagerly
desir'd to make a prey of us: Yet
still kept us in suspense, even in the
Arms of Death; about Four in the af∣ternoon,
the foremast sheet was blown
to rags, and the vast noise and Uni∣versal
<PB N="156" REF="85"/>
rouling of the ship, fill'd us all
with confusion and horror.</P>
<P>And now being about 3000 Leagues
from Land, we saw ourselves exposed
to the outragious Element; without
sails, and distitute of all means that
might tend to our safty. The vast
prodigious waves no sooner rowl'd
over our Decks, and fill'd our ship
with water, but greater still return'd,
and seem'd to sink us to the Bottom;
so that sometimes we had scarce
time to take breath, and hardly knew
whether we were in the ship or the
sea.</P>
<P>In this miserable condition and ap∣proaching
danger, every one plied
the pump; and the short remainder
of the day, we spent in fastening a
sprit sail to the yard of the fore-mast sail,
which we had no sooner done, but as
an addition to our misery, a dismal
shout was heard at the sight of one
of our ships, which driven by the
violence of the Storm, was just
ready to run fowl of us, and split us
both.</P>
<P>All that's horrible and amazing in
death; presented it self to our view;
<PB N="157" REF="85"/>
himself at the last moment of life,
knew not what course to take, or
what he should do to avoid it▪ we
unfurl'd our two sprit-sails, which
were no sooner loose, but the winds
blew them into a thousand Shatters
however they serv'd to Clear us of

shew'd our lights▪ that hoisting her
foremast sail she past by, without
damage on either side.</P>
<P>In the midst of so many alarums and
continual dangers, we past the rest of
night in pumping, and rummaging
the inside of the ship, which was so
wet that there was not a dry place to
be found in't to lie down: Rivers of
Water ran continually over the deck;
the Boxes, chests, and all the hamocks
were thrown down, and nothing was
to be seen throughout the whole Vessel
but the perfect picture of a shipwrack,
to which the winds and Seas seem'd
to conspire; this night we had the
the <HI>Jack Staff</HI> carried away by one
single Wave.</P>
<P>We waited for day Break with more
impatience than our Friends for our
Return▪ as tho' 'twould alay the storm,
<PB N="158" REF="86"/>
or rescue us from danger; at last it
came, but alas it only serv'd to give
us a clearer sight of our Misery, so
that <HI>Friday</HI> in the morning, the wind
and the seas having abated nothing of
their rage, but still encreasing; and
finding our selves quite spent, we
with horror beheld the Wild and al∣most
inevitable death that waited for
us.</P>
<P>We had recourse to GOD as the
only means left, and with tears in
our Eyes, and terror in our Hearts,
we implor'd his Infinite Goodness,
by the suffrages of the Blessed Vir∣gin,
and St. <HI>Joseph;</HI> whom we pray'd
to interpose their credit to obtain
mercy for us. In the mean time
we ply'd four pumps continually,
and having discover'd two great Leaks,
the one afore, the other aff't we were
oblieg'd to make a well in the bottom
of the keel, and to draw the water
thence with Buckets and Pails to pre∣vent
sinking.</P>
<P>'Twas strange, that tho' watching
and fasting had quite spent us; yet
we shou'd gather strength out of our
very weakness, and work and toil on,
<PB N="159" REF="86"/>
without so much as reflecting on our
miserable condition; each of us thought
of nothing but disputing his life, which
he saw prest and attackt with a thou∣sand
dangers at once.</P>
<P>We continued thus toyling in our
Misery, till four in the evening, when
not knowing what farther course to
take to save our selves, or to resist the
violence of the storm, we a second time
adrest our selves to GOD, vowing
upon a deliverance to have a Service,
or each his particular Mass said at
St. <HI>Anns</HI> in <HI>Auray.</HI></P>
<P>We crept up upon the Deck, and
our <HI>Almoner</HI> on his knees, under
the quarter deck, as did all the rest
invok the aid and mercy of Heaven,
in the name of two hundred and fifty
Saints more, who poured out their
Souls in the same devotion, implor∣ing
the mercy of GOD; never was a
more moving Spectacle seen, and I
then with horror read our ruin in the
disparing looks of Monsieur <HI>Duquesne,</HI>
who kneeling on his bed, and looking
fixedly on the raging Seas, mounting
high in the air, and threatning us
with ruin, seem'd to tell us there was
<PB N="160" REF="87"/>
no more hopes left but in the immedi∣ate
Favour of Heaven: The Vow be∣ing
made, he let himself fall on his
bed, saying his only hopes were in
the Infinite mercy of GOD, and that
'twas invain to strive any longer.</P>
<P>This, I own threw me into the last
despair, yet we were resolv'd to try
once more what we could do; resolv∣ing
to save our selves, or perish; we
try'd to hoist a second time our fore∣mast
sail, where we us'd care in tak∣ing
of the rise; each with fear and
impatience waited the success of a
course, that was either to save or ruin
us; and at this very time we were
quite consum'd with the labour of the
merciless Sea.</P>
<P>A little after a Seaman, whom the
Sea had swept out of the ship, was
thrown in again by the Waves, and
sav'd.</P>
<P>But GOD at last show'd us mercy,
and pitty, and was pleas'd to put an
end to all our Fatigues and sufferings;
for unfurling the foremast sail, it re∣sisted
the wind; when full of joy and
acknowledgement for so visible a pro∣tection,
we began to pursue our way;
<PB N="161" REF="87"/>
and in our turn, triumphing over
those Waves that had so insulted us
for two days together.</P>
<P>We ran thus the rest of the night,
and next day, being <HI>Saturday,</HI> the
wind began to alter about four in the
morning; so that at break of day we saw
our selves out of that danger, which
continually threatned us for eight and
forty hours together, without sleeping,
or eating, or drinking, save a little
Biscuit and Rack.</P>
<P>When we had stopt the two leakes
as well as we could, we fell to settling
all things in the inside of the ship,
that were in confusion; for nothing
cou'd be seen but Chests and Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
scatter'd up and down; fowls and
beasts drown'd; in short, an Emblem
of an universal Deluge: each now
taking breath, began to provide for
himself, some prest with hunger, be∣gan
to search for Victuals; but the
kitchins being spoiled we could have
none drest in three days time; and
others almost dead for want of sleep,
fell to drying their beds and cloaths
in the Sun.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="88"/>
Never was the returning spring,
after a long and Torrid winter, more
greatful than the sight of the Sun to us,
which compos'd the remainder of the
storm, and hush't it quite asleep:
This was a truly happy day to us;
but seeing our selves all alone, we
reckon'd we were preserv'd by Heaven,
only to carry home the dismal news of
the loss of the rest of the Squadron; we
sail'd on, still continuing our way,
and endeavouring to discover what
was become of the rest of the ships,
whose rendevouze was appointed at
<HI>Martinico.</HI></P>

Hope,</HI> we meet with contrary
winds, with much fatiegue and sick∣ness.
Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI> finds
part of the Squadron which he gave
for lost.</HEAD>
<P>THe begining of the month we sail'd
with all success imaginable, during
which time we often saw certain dark
Birds with yellow Beaks, but towards
the end, as we approacht the Cape of
<HI>Good Hope,</HI> meeting with contrary
winds we suffered great fatigues,
which were very prejudicial to our
men, and occasioned the Bloody Flux,
and other Distempers; and the Cold
increasing daily, was as great a Mor∣tification
to us now, as ever the heats
had been before.</P>
<P>The Severity of the Climate had
not been so tiresome, if our passage
<PB N="164" REF="89"/>
had been more speedy; but we scarcely
had sailed above fourty or fifty Leagues,
but the Wind chopt about, which
forc'd us to ly by till it came fair again;
and these delays were very uneasiy
to us, by reason of the continual rains,
and excessive rowlings of the ship.</P>
<P>The third of <HI>April,</HI> I remember
amongst a number of other Misfor∣tunes,
we had Thunder, Lighting and
contrary Winds, opprest us, all at once;
which gave us all imaginable distur∣bance,
and the excessive roulling and tos∣sing
of the ship would not let us take
one moments rest, or suffer us to stay
a minute in a place, and sure nothing
could be more irksom than our present
condition was, especially the little
hopes we had of a speedy deliverance.</P>
<P>The next day we received an un∣expected
comfort; for about Seven in
the morning we perceiv'd, through
the vast Fogs that arose, two ships a
head of us, to whom we gave chace,
though all alone, and had suffered so
much in our Rigging; they immedi∣ately
made us the Signals of Acknow∣ledgments,
in furling the Fore-sail, and
lashing the Fore-top-sail; to which we
<PB N="165" REF="89"/>
answer'd in the same manner, and
had no sooner hoisted up a white flag,
but they did so too: We quickly per∣ceiv'd
they were our own ships, and
as soon as came near them, they seve∣rally
saluted us with five Guns a piece,
and a <HI>Vive le Roy;</HI> the first was the
<HI>Lion,</HI> whose Poop, as well as ours,
was carried away; the second was the
<HI>Dragon,</HI> who for eight days had been
seperated from the rest: If we were
glad at the sight of them, they were
not less surpriz'd at our return, they
believing us lost ever since they had
seen a Top-mast floating on the Sea;
they told us, that the Squadron had
suffered extreamly, and that the <HI>Bird</HI>
had been forced to heave her Boat and
four Guns over board to save herself;
and that the <HI>Flourishing</HI> and the <HI>Rock</HI>
were nigh being lost, all the Goods
in the first being spoiled, and the last
having been obliged to pump continu∣ally
to save themselves.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">We gave thanks to God for finding our
selves on the <HI>Bank of Needles,</HI>
which we happily passed, and the
gentle <HI>Trading Winds</HI> succeed∣ing,
we sailed prosperously.</HEAD>
<P>AS bad as this news was, we were
glad to hear it, for we never
expected to see or hear of one ano∣ther
more, and great wou'd have
been our satisfaction in pursuing our
Voyage together, if the South West
Winds, which lasted eight days, had
not obliged us to lie by; at last they
chang'd, and having seen a little Bird,
of the size of a Sparrow, we judg'd
we were not far from Land.</P>
<P>Having sounded several times with∣out
finding ground, though according
to the variation, and the Point of the
Pilots, we shou'd have been on the
<HI>Bank</HI> of <HI>Needles.</HI> The <HI>7th.</HI> of <HI>April</HI>
we saw a Whale, and several Birds, as
Cormorants, and <HI>Velvet Channels,</HI> were
<PB N="167" REF="90"/>
sitting on the Water, which gave us to
understand we were very near Land;
so that next day being the eighth, the
<HI>Dragon</HI> having found ground, hoisted
a Flag to give us notice of it, we pre∣sently
huddled over a few pray∣ers,
according to custom, and sound∣ing
all along we found ground in a 100
fathom Water.</P>
<P>It was wonderful strange that in this
place, where the Sea is always so boi∣sterous
and violent, it prov'd a dead
Calm, followed by so gentle a Breeze,
that we past this <HI>Bank</HI> of 24 Leagues
in length, with our Top-gallant Sails
only: Thus having doubled the <HI>Cape</HI>
of <HI>Good Hope</HI> we took heart, and ho∣ped
for a prosperous Voyage hence
forward, the Winds being now so
favourable.</P>
<P>And indeed we made great way, for
after having sailed 200 Leagues be∣yond
it, we began to breath in a tem∣perate
Air, and to have fair and clear
Weather, constantly accompanied with
the gentle <HI>Trading Winds;</HI> it seem'd
as if God was now pleased to give
us a little comfort, after so much mi∣sery
and Sufferings; and, to say truth,
<PB N="168" REF="91"/>
we extreamly stood in need of it, for
the Vessel was not able to bear any
more weather; our Men were very
sickly, and grew so more and more,
with what they had suffered in doub∣ling
the Cape; so that every day some
of 'em died, either of the Flux, or of
the <HI>Scurvey.</HI></P>
<P>Yet still we had reason to believe
our selves happy, the Cold abating by
degrees, and warm weather succeed∣ing,
which was no small relief to those
who were ill of the latter Distemper;
the Sea was now no longer dangerous,
but on the contrary all was calm and
pleasant, as if we had made an In-land
Voyage.</P>

<P>THis happiness, and the Diversi∣ons
we gave our selves of Gam∣ing,
Dancing and Reading, charm'd
the fateigues of so long a Voyage;
<PB N="169" REF="91"/>
besides these, we often delighted our
selves with Fishing, and in one calm
day we caught numbers of <HI>Tons, Gold∣fishes</HI>
and <HI>Bounites,</HI> and a large Fish
call'd a <HI>Requiem,</HI> by fastening a great
piece of Bacon to the hook.</P>
<P>This monstrous Creature is between
15 and 16 foot long, and almost as
big as a Man, it has no shell, but a
skin thick and rough like Shagrin,
with a Muzzle half round, distinct
from the rest of the head; four fingers
below, towards the Belly is plac'd the
larger mouth, whose two Jaw bones
have each three rows of Teeth, which
are large and flat, yet very sharp, so
that whenever he eats he is forc'd to
throw himself on his back.</P>
<P>It seems as if Nature, wonderful in
her productions, wou'd by that means
suppress the devouring Appetite of this
greedy Creature, which I have seen re∣turn
three times to the same Bait, tho'
the hook had torn his Gills before.</P>
<P>This Monstrous creature does not
shun Men, as other fish do, for he no
sooner sees him in the water, but he
follows him, and when he designs to
quit the prey, he throws himself
<PB N="170" REF="92"/>
upon it, carrying away that part on
which he fastens first; he is never
seen but in a calm, following ships to
catch whatever meat or rubbish the
Seamen throw out.</P>
<P>Certain little Fishes of the size of
a <HI>Sardine</HI> which Swims before, (free
from the insults of this creature as
devouring as it is) and serve him
as a Pilot, for from thence it is they
are called by that name; they are
such faithful companions to him, that
when he is taken with the hook, and
drawing in, they lie on his back,
and suffer themselves to be drawn in
also.</P>
<P>I had forgot to mention how we
found in the belly of one we took, a
Knife and six pound of Bacon, which
in all probability it got at the hook;
I believe there is no creature in the
World so hard liv'd, and difficult to
kill.</P>
<P>I took notice of one thing, among
several others on board our Ship,
that was peculiarly amazing in this
fish; which was this, that it being
cut in peices, and each peice, sepera∣ted
from the heart, yet they all
<PB N="171" REF="92"/>
mov'd alike, which surprized us very
much.</P>
<P>This fish has a sort of marrow in
the head, that hardens against the Sun,

White-wine, is very good for the

<P>WHile we enjoyed the innocent
diversion of fishing, a more
sollid entertainment diverted us for
some time, the wind which we had
directly in our Stern, made us dis∣patch
no less than 40 Leagues a day,
sailing now as expeditiously since our
departure from <HI>Pontichery,</HI> as we did
unsuccesfully before.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="93"/>
The <HI>25th.</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> the <HI>Dragon</HI>
having given a signal about 3 in the
afternoon, that she saw two ships,
the Admiral ordered her to give chase
to them; they seem'd to be <HI>Dutch</HI>
bound for St. <HI>Helens,</HI> from whence
we were not fat; but when we came
up with them, we discovered they
were the <HI>Bird</HI> and the <HI>Flourishing,</HI> which
we had not seen in two Months be∣fore.
Our Squadron had now been
all re-united, if the <HI>Rock,</HI> which they
told us, was a head of us, had been in
company; We made use of the Wind,
which was very favourable to joyn
her at the Isle of <HI>Ascentions,</HI> near which
we should pass to take some <HI>Tortoise</HI>
aboard.</P>
<P>We never had more need of going
a shoar, for our Company was harrast
and quite spent with our poor diet, and
continual pumping night and day; for
our refuge was nothing but a little
Brandy at our meals, with Biscuit and
stinking flesh, and this was but a small
relief to the sick, who dy'd 3 or 4 at
a time, and were pittyed in vain by
others, in whose power it was not to
help them.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="93"/>
You might see fifty at a time, some
dried up with a Fevour, and others
consum'd with the Bloody Flux, a third
sort bloated and disfigured with the
Country-disease, for we could not get
one drop of good Wine, or a bit of fresh
meat for them, since our fowl and
Sheep, design'd for their use, perished
in the Tempest, which surpriz'd us in
the height of <HI>Mascarin.</HI></P>
<P>You may imagine that the long
continuance of such ill diet, began to
be very loathsom to us; the <HI>Scurvy,</HI>
and weakness of a continual <HI>Flux</HI> had
brought me to nothing; but I was
still preserv'd, and tho' I had the same
distemper with the rest, yet not the
same destiny; for I often saw my self
surrounded with the sick, and dying,
without the least fear of death, being
fully perswaded I should recover when
I went a shoar at the Isle of <HI>Ascention,</HI>
which we all impatiently long'd
for.</P>

<P>We no sooner came near the

sorts of Birds, Inhabitants of
this desert Island, came in flocks, as
it were, to meet and receive us; they
crouded so thick about us, that we
killed them with half-pikes. Here
we anchored in 30 fathom water, over
against a great Sand-Creek, where
the Tortoises go ashoar, which is at
the foot of the Mountain of the <HI>Cross,</HI>
so called, because of a Cross which
the <HI>Portuguese</HI> have planted on the

are obliged to leave a Letter in a

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Description of the Isle of <HI>Ascen∣tion,</HI>
and of the great Tortoises
that are found there.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as we had cast Anchor,
the Seamen began to fish, and
catch vast numbers; next day I went
ashoar, although it was very difficult
landing, the Sloop being obliged to
set us ashoar on a steep rock, where
we were forced to creep on all four,
with a great deal of trouble and dan∣ger;
several of our sick that were
landed here, died presently, not hav∣ing
strength enough to bear the Air,
and the difficulties of climbing the
Cliffs.</P>
<P>There is no Water found in this
uninhabited Island, nor any thing to
be seen but parch'd barren Hills, and
Vales without verdure; nay, not so
much as a blade of Grass, or any
Herb; so violent and piercing are the
Rays of the Sun. It's situated in 7 d.
30 m. of S. L. and may be about
<PB N="175" REF="96"/>
five leagues in compass. At first it
appeared full of Mountains and Crag∣gy
Rocks, cover'd with Birds dung,
who make their Nests on the top of
them; but in the West of the Island,
two high Mountains rise, which are a
little green, being better moistned by
the frequent Dews, which causes the
ground all about, to abound with the
largest, and best tasted Pursloine that
ever I met with.</P>
<P>As weak as I was, the desire I had
to be cured of the Scurvy, in taking
the Air at Land, which is the only
remedy for this evil, made me run
up and down this part of the Island;
where I observ'd one thing that was
very extraordinary: The Birds which
stood thick on the Rocks, suffered us
to come so near them, that we might
take them with our hands, and I
stooping to gather some Pursloine,
several hovering round my head,
came and pearcht on my Hat, of
which I took four alive, and kill'd
two more with my Cane.</P>
<P>The great numbers of these Birds,
destroy the young Tortoises as soon
as hatch'd, for they love their flesh so
<PB N="176" REF="96"/>
well, that they are continually pur∣suing
them; and before they leave the
Egg, or are able to gain the Sea, or
swim on the surface of the Water;
they kill them with their Beaks; but
after they are grown bigger, the light∣ness
of their shell makes them swim
with more strength, and defends them
from these Birds of Prey. Yet not∣withstanding
this vast destruction of
them, their number is immense; the
Tortoise being one of those Creatures,
that multiply most. Nor will they ad∣mire
at it, who consider it as one of
the largest fish, that has its Nutri∣ment
from this Element.</P>
<P>Its shape and colour being known
by most people, I thought it unne∣cessary
to give you a particular de∣scription
of it here; I shall only say,
that its head resembles that of an
Eagle, and the Fins, which are about
a foot and half long, are hid under
their Shells: And for that reason,
when the <HI>Requiems</HI> (a fish I have men∣tioned
before) meet with the Tortoises,
they always seize upon that part first,
and so kill them; their Shell being
but thin, and uncapable of resisting
<PB N="177" REF="97"/>
so great a strength, as that of the <HI>Re∣quiem:</HI>
This Battle I have often seen
my self, and so can the better attest
the truth of it.</P>
<P>Some who have been ill inform'd,
have said, that they make use of their
Paws in fighting, as the Land Tor∣toises
do; but nothing is more false
than this, they having nothing like
a Paw, only a few Prickles at the end
of their Fins, which they Crawl ashoar
with, and dig holes in the ground to
lay their Eggs in; which having done,
they immediately return to Sea again,
leaving them covered, to be hatch'd
by the warmth of the Sun.</P>
<P>Great care and diligence must be
used in the taking of them, for they
are very quick-sighted, you must
range your self in the night, in seve∣ral
places of the Creek, where they
are known to come ashoar, and when
you perceive them at a sufficient di∣stance
from the Water, run to 'em and
throw 'em on their backs, and then
'tis impossible for 'em to rise again.</P>
<P>The Tortoises that are taken at the
Isle of <HI>Ascention,</HI> are the biggest that
ever I saw; there are some that weigh
<PB N="178" REF="97"/>
three or four hundred weight, suffici∣ent
to feed so many men at a time;
the flesh is very wholsom and delicate,
and the Eggs, which are exactly round,
and are found in great quantities a∣long
the coast, are almost as big as an
Hen's, but their shells are so thick, that
if you throw them against the ground,
they will rebound without breaking.</P>

sick on their beds, and they who were

mov'd compassion: Amongst the first

Mr. <HI>Baron</HI> had the honour of seven

so that our ship by its shatter'd

<P>In the mean time we made the best
of our way towards <HI>Martinico,</HI> where
Monsieur <HI>Duquesme</HI> had orders to touch
at; and just as we expected to disco∣ver

ships, the Admiral of which had her
Flag on the main-top mast, which
made us believe they were the Enemy;
however superior they seem'd to us in
strength, we presently prepar'd for a
fight, brought down our Hamocks,
and threw the Chests into the hold;
at least making a shew of courage,
<PB N="180" REF="98"/>
tho' we desired nothing less than fight∣ing,
in the miserable condition we
were in.</P>
<P>Each reason'd differently of the mat∣ter,
as he was more or less concern'd

discerning than the rest, inferr'd that
if this was an <HI>English</HI> Squadron sent
to intercept our passed, <HI>France</HI> must be
the sufferer, for we shou'd never be
able to resist them.</P>
<P>But while this was considering on
he resolv'd, that during the rest of the

(which we had of them) as possible,
and that when night came on, we
shou'd steer a false course to avoid
them, which was the only way we
cou'd take in the present exigency.</P>
<P>A Capuchin, a Passenger (who
was our Almoner since the death

above deck by order of the

in few words, put us in mind
of that Courage and Bravery we had

exhorted us as much as his fears wou'd
permit him, to abate nothing of it in
the present necessity, when our Lives
and Liberties was both at stake.</P>
<P>This Discourse out of season, made
me resolve on a certain thing I scru∣pled
to think of before, which hap∣pily
had no further consequence; for
night had scarce conceal'd us from the
Enemy, but immediately tacking about
we made a false course; in the morn∣ing
we found our selves as secure as we
cou'd wish, and in a few hours in sight
of <HI>Martinico,</HI> where we came to An∣chor
over against St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Fort,
<HI>Thursday</HI> the <HI>7th.</HI> of <HI>June.</HI> There rod
at Anchor in the Harbour four of the
King's ships, Commanded by Mon∣sieur
<HI>le Chevalier de Arbouvill,</HI> who,
as an inferiour Officer to our Com∣mandant,
struck his Flame, and salu∣ted
us with seven Guns, and we in
return answer'd with the same num∣ber.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">We put the sick a shoar. The whole Squa∣dron
rejoins, and prepares to return
immediately to <HI>France.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE immediately debarkt the
sick, and lodg'd them in an
House for that purpose, upon the shoar
near the River; who were furnished
with Bread, Wine, fresh Meat, Oran∣ges,
Lemons, Bananes, Ananes, and
all sorts of Refreshments; as were the
rest of the Company, which with the
plenty of Fish the Negroes brought
on board, were sufficient to restore us
to our former vigour.</P>
<P>We understood there, that the ten
ships we met in our return, were <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
bound home from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI>
whom the Squadron of Monsieur <HI>le
Chevalier de Arbouville</HI> had oblig'd to
raise the siege of <HI>Guadaloupa,</HI> with the
loss of 500 of the Enemy, and a great
many Cannon, having understood
since by some <HI>French</HI> prisoners, who
had made their escapes, that they
were so much concern'd at the sight
<PB N="183" REF="100"/>
of us, that as soon as 'twas night they pre∣sentlv
tackt and stood a false course as well
as we.</P>
<P>They told us also some news from
<HI>France,</HI> and amongst other things, that of
the death of Monsieur <HI>Segnelay,</HI> and of the
worthy choice his Majesty had made of
Monsieur <HI>de Poutchartraine</HI> to supply his
place. The death of this Minister was the
reason we met with no new orders at
<HI>Martinico,</HI> as he promis'd our Commandant,
nor the <HI>Flute</HI> loaden with Provisions which
he was to send thither, which was the oc∣casion
of a greater scarcity there than we
expected, Meal and fresh Provisions be∣ing
somewhat scarce at <HI>Martinico,</HI> eversince
the War.</P>
<P>This Island is so well known in <HI>France,</HI>
by the relations that have been made of it,
and the Trade it maintains there, that I
ought not to speak much of it, except
some small matters I observ'd in the short
stay I made there; but that which pleas'd
me most was, the many fine Houses scitu∣ated
on the Mountains all about, whose
Avenues, Allies and Arbours are compos'd
of Jessamins, Orange and Lemon Trees,
which are as common there, as Apple trees
in <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>The Women there wou'd be very a∣greeable,
but for the pale colour which
is contracted by the Air of the Island,
where the heats in my mind are too great
<PB N="184" REF="100"/>
for any, but the Natives to live, happily
there.</P>
<P>Not being to make any long stay there,
we began to Wood and Water, after we
had clean'd our Ship and stopt the two
leaks we had. At this time the <HI>Rock,</HI> whom
we had not yet seen, came from an ad∣jacent
harbour where she had lain three
days at Anchor before our arrival, and
came to an anchor over against the Fort of
St. <HI>Peter,</HI> driven by the Wind and Tide;
she rang'd our side so close, that intending
to pass betwixt us and the <HI>Flourishing,</HI> she
struck against our head and broke the
<HI>Beak,</HI> which so provoked Monsieur <HI>Du∣quesne,</HI>
that he resolv'd to have the head
<HI>Pilot</HI> drawn under the keel, but he was
discharg'd after three days lying in
Irons.</P>

<P>IT must be own'd that <HI>Idea's</HI> which the
mind forms of a future happiness are
sometimes wonderful, and delude the time
till we arrive at it. I was restless till I
came to <HI>Martinico,</HI> and when there, as un∣easy
<PB N="185" REF="101"/>
till I reacht <HI>France,</HI> nor was it with∣out
reason, for whatever advantage we
had by being there, there was none but
desired to leave it, when he reflected
on the number of those that died there
daily.</P>
<P>The <HI>Standard,</HI> a ship of the Company's
coming from the <HI>Indies</HI> with two others,
named the <HI>Game</HI> and the <HI>Loure,</HI> brought
a pestilential distemper thither from <HI>Bru∣rill,</HI>
which had not yet ceast; so that the
most healthy and vigorous amongst us,
upon the least excess, were carried off in
4 or 5 days at most, in spight of any
remedies that could be used.</P>
<P>This mortality which might have very
much lessened the Company, and rendred
them so weak as to be scarce able to
bring the Ship back again to <HI>France,</HI> made
the Commandant resolve to hasten away;
we took in Wine and new Biscuit, and
after imbarking the sick, we sail'd the <HI>2d.</HI>
of <HI>July</HI> at nine in the morning, followed
by Monsieur <HI>le<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehvaler de Arbouville,</HI> who
was to Convoy two and twenty Mer∣chants
to <HI>Rochfort.</HI></P>
<P>We were presently becalm'd, which
hindred our coming within sight of the
<HI>English</HI> Islands till the <HI>8th.</HI> when making
all the sail we could we left the convoy
behind us the Merchants sailing very
heavily.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="101"/>
By leaving <HI>Martinico</HI> we thought to
have left the distemper that reign'd there,
but it follw'd, us and did not take it's leave
till it had swept away sixteen of our Men,
in the first fifteen days after our departure.
Monsieur <HI>de Questilly,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Dra∣gon,</HI>
struck to it, as well as others; to whom
we gave the accustom'd honours, and the
Commandant put Monsieur <HI>de Aubervill,</HI>
our Lieutenant in his place.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Wind continuing
good, we past the <HI>Tropick</HI> of <HI>Cancer</HI> on the
<HI>21st.</HI> and except a few days sailed very
succesfully the rest of the month, and
during those few we met with very rough
Seas, fomented by violent Storms; but the
very thought of approaching <HI>France</HI> made us
easy, though we had reason enough to be
otherwise; so nothing disturb'd us after∣wards,
seeing our selves near the end of
so many fatiegues, and so long and hazard∣ous
a Voyage.</P>
<P>The <HI>9th.</HI> of <HI>August</HI> the <HI>Rock</HI> hung out
<HI>English</HI> Colours, to give us notice that she
discover'd a sail which we saw behind us,
making all the sail she could to us; we
were willing to gratify her curiosity,
furl'd our sails, and gave her time enough
to come up with us, and after she was
near enough to discover our strength, she
stood away presently without daring to
come any nearer. Monsieur <HI>Duquesne</HI>
having hung out <HI>French</HI> colours, which
<PB N="187" REF="102"/>
she did too without taking them down,
tho' we hung out <HI>English</HI> Colours again.</P>
<P>Next day the <HI>Lyon</HI> was dispatcht to
discover Cape <HI>Finister,</HI> who believing
she had sight of it, gave us the Signal;
but her mistake was very great, and our
joy short, for we did not discover it till
next day; the <HI>Bird,</HI> who kept the head of
the Squdron, having got a clear view of it,
we gave God thanks by singing <HI>Te Deum,</HI>
the Wind being at <HI>North East,</HI> and there∣fore
contrary, we came within Cannon
shot of the Land, tacking till it chang'd,
which it did that very evening, and carried
us so happily for seven days together,
that at last we arrived at the heighth of
our Wishes, that is, within sight of <HI>France,</HI>
and came all six to an Anchor under
the Island of <HI>Groye, Saturday</HI> the eighteenth
of <HI>August</HI> 1691, at Nine in the morning:
Whence sailing again the <HI>19th.</HI> we en∣tered
<HI>For Lewis</HI> full of joy for our hap∣py
return, thanking the Divine Pro∣vidence
who had preserved us through a
thousand dangers in this long and painful
Voyage, from which we parted from the

TO THE
CANARY--ISLANDS,
<HI>Cape-Verde, Senegal,</HI> and <HI>Gambia.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Depar∣ture from <HI>Paris.</HI></NOTE>I Had been almost three Years em∣ploy'd
about the <HI>Hotell de Dieu</HI> of
<HI>Paris,</HI> (that is, the Hospital of
God) when I heard that Monsieur
<HI>D'ancourt</HI> was ready to part for <HI>Cape-Verde,</HI>
in Quality of Director-General
of the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company; when
I immediately resolv'd to accompany
him, and he consented to it: and having
agreed on Terms, the 14. of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1682.
<PB N="2" REF="108"/>
he presented me to the Gentlemen of
the Company who confirm'd what we
had settled.</P>
<P>After imploying a few days in settling
my Affairs, and in taking leave of my
Friends, we parted for <HI>Orleans;</HI> where
we took boat for <HI>Nantes</HI> on the <HI>Loire:</HI>
and tho' this Passage is commonly made
in two or three days, yet we were seven
or eight about it, and that not without
Danger too.</P>
<P>The Wind was still contrary, and so
violent, that the River was almost as
boisterous as the Sea; the Rivers too
overflow'd so, that we lost the Chan∣nel;
so that only discerning the tops of
little Trees, all the rest being under Wa∣ter,
we found our selves sometimes fast on
the Trunks, like Birds perching on Trees.</P>
<P>At last, however, we arriv'd at
<HI>Nantes,</HI> and after ten days stay, we took
Horse for <HI>Brest:</HI> what we saw of <HI>Britany</HI>
as we past, was not very entertaining;
tho' it's known, this Province is good and
fruitful in many places; but all along as
we past, we had a very unpleasant
Prospect.</P>
<P>Being arriv'd at <HI>Brest</HI> the 4th. of <HI>Fe∣bruary,</HI>
we expected to Sail in a few
<PB N="3" REF="108"/>
Days; but the Ship was not ready, but
ill careen'd, and had not half her Furni∣ture;
and we were to wait till she was
new masted, and till she was fit to meet
with stormy Weather, and the Enemy
which we expected.</P>
<P>Two Months were spent in this Work;
the Ship was call'd the St. <HI>Catherine,</HI> of
four hundred Tun, carrying forty Guns;
'twas built at <HI>Flessingue,</HI> and design'd for
a Cruiser; Captain <HI>Monsegue</HI> comman∣ded
it by orders of the Company.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brest.</NOTE>The Port of <HI>Brest,</HI> where the Frigat
lay, is the best we have in the Ocean;
the greatst Ships ride there in Safety, and
shelter'd from all Weather as in a Cham∣ber;
whence 'tis call'd by that Name.
Ships may sail out of it at low Water as
well as at high; for they always ride a-float.
It's as straight at the Month as
a River, and has two Half-Moons of
each side, and on the right a strong
Castle, old built, which defends the en∣trance.
This Port goes in a Spiral Line;
it's a large half League long, and about
two hundred Paces wide: it's situated
between two Mountains, which cover
it. All these Advantages it receives from
Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="109"/>
In this Port I saw the greatest and the
beautifulest Ships in the World; amongst
others, the Admiral, nam'd the <HI>Royal
Sun;</HI> it has not so much gilding as the
<HI>Royal Lewis</HI> of <HI>Toulon,</HI> but 'tis better built;
longer, and a better Sailer. It carries 120
Guns, and the great Cabine is magni∣ficent,
richly gilt, and the Cieling is of
the Design Monsieur <HI>le Poune:</HI> there
are about fifteen more but of a lesser size;
yet very proper, and beautifully built.</P>
<P>Besides these, there were about fifty
more of 90, 80, 70, 60, and 50 Guns,
without reckoning smaller Frigats of a
lower Rate: next to the <HI>Royal Sun,</HI> are
the <HI>Queen,</HI> the <HI>Crown,</HI> the <HI>Glorious,</HI> the
<HI>Beautiful,</HI> the <HI>Good,</HI> the <HI>Thunderer,</HI> the
the <HI>Lightning,</HI> the <HI>Diamond,</HI> &amp;c. These
vast Machines give just Wonder, and
appear like floating Palaces.</P>
<P>Our Ship being compleatly equip'd, it
sail'd out of the <HI>Chamber</HI> into the Road
the 20th. of <HI>March;</HI> five of the Kings
Ships were fitted out at the same time,
of which four were to joyn those of
<HI>Toulon,</HI> and the fifth to Convoy some
Ships belonging to the <HI>East-India-Com∣pany.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="109"/>
<HI>Wednesday</HI> the 9th of <HI>April</HI> 1682. I
embark'd with four Sons of a Family
which went with us: as Monsieur <HI>Dan∣cort</HI>
continu'd still at <HI>Brest,</HI> these Gen∣tlemen
and I diverted our selves a little
with Hunting, believing we might as ea∣sily
go a-shore again as we came aboard:
the Director's Cook who came aboard a∣bout
some business, made use of a little
Skiff which was row'd by two Lads,
which we us'd to go a-shore in; and
were now got 2 Leagues on the Sea near
<HI>Cameret,</HI> without minding which way
he should get back: we were so earnest
taking the Diversion of Hunting, that
we did not care where we put a-shore,
without minding the Danger we ran,
in passing over craggy Rocks hanging
over the Sea, into which I had like to
fall two or three times. And after all
this pains, we had the Disappointment to
meet with no Game; we were forc'd
to employ our selves in killing Larks,
which prov'd afterwards more of use to
us then we imagin'd then: tir'd therefore
with this sort of Hunting, we past to a
better Entertainment, and fell to a Hare-Pasty,
which we brought with us, and a
Glass of good Wine.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="110"/>
After we had spent our Provisions, we
return'd to our little Boat, and were no
sooner at Sea again, than a sudden Storm
arose, in which I thought we should
have perish'd every moment. One of
our Gentlemen who was very much fa∣tigu'd,
had fall'n asleep as soon as ever
he came into the Skiff, and was wa∣ken'd
by our Noise, and the tossing of
the Boat; and when we were half way,
tho' he was scarce throughly awake, he
was so sensible of the Danger we were in,
that he cry'd out, We were certainly
lost if we did not return again.</P>
<P>Our little Rowers were almost spent,
but not their Courage, who pretended
to chear us, saying, There was no Dan∣ger
of the Boat, tho' she rowl'd so; and
if the worst came to the worst, 'twas on∣ly
swimming for't: but they were mi∣staken
as to me; and besides, the Waves
were so great and violent, that instead
of landing us, they had dash'd us in pie∣ces
against the Rocks.</P>
<P>We follow'd the Counsel of our Com∣panion,
and turn'd back again, rowing
with all our Might; and at last, with
much ado, got a-shore, where we wait∣ed
for calmer Weather.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="110"/>
In the mean time, while we were en∣joying
our Safety a-shore, we heard a
single Gun, and saw at the same time
the Top-Sails loose, which is the usu∣al
Signal of Sailing: There were seve∣ral
Lighters near us, which might have
carry'd us aboard; but we could not
prevail with any of the Masters to whom
they belong'd, to give us a Cast.</P>
<P>Thus we saw our Ship under Sail, the
Admiral saluted with seven Guns, ma∣king
the best of her way, running be∣fore
the Wind, with all the Sail she could
make; and I was not a little troubled
to be left behind thus, and all my Things
aboard.</P>
<P>We follow'd the sight of our Vessel,
haling her as loud as ever we could baul,
and discharging our Fuseels, but all in
vain, the Vessel disappear'd; one of our
Companions, who was but an ill Foot∣man,
took <HI>Cameret</HI> Road, believing
he should find us there; and being in
search of him, we spent a good part
of the Night in looking after one ano∣ther.</P>
<P>Many Misfortunes attended us on our
way; for ever and anon, one was bogg'd
in the Marshes, another would fall into
<PB N="8" REF="111"/>
a Ditch, each calling on the other for
help, and all cursing the Chase: Hun∣ger
follow'd our other Miseries, when
at last we got into an Inn, where every
thing was proportionable to our short
Purses; wretched Provision and Beds:
however, all that we had was spent that
Night, and we were forc'd to depart
Fasting next Morning.</P>
<P>As we went again in search of our
stray'd Companion, and coasting by the
Sea, we perceiv'd Masts, which at first
we took for high Trees which grew by
the Sea, not so much as flattering our
selves that we should ever see our Ship
again, which we thought had been far
enough off; but coming near, we found
we had not lost our Passage, for she An∣chor'd
in <HI>Camaret</HI> Road, three Leagues
from <HI>Brest.</HI></P>
<P>Great was our Joy, and we had now
no more to do but to find out our Com∣panion,
and go aboard: we endeavour'd
by Signals to give notice of us to the
Ship, but with no better Success than
the Day before; so that the Sloap did
not come to fetch us.</P>
<P>As we sought all imaginable ways to
get out of our Troubles, we observ'd a
<PB N="9" REF="111"/>
Bark at Sea plying towards the Ship; I
don't know how we came to fancy that
he whom we sought might be in it; but
we fancy'd right, and he was the first
Man we perceiv'd from the Shore; so we
made Signs to 'em at a distance, which
he understood, and the Bark made to∣wards
us: but it being impossible to
come near, by reason of the Rocks,
'twas our Business to get aboard as well
as we could.</P>
<P>At last we did; and after a great deal
of Rejoycing at our Meeting so happily
again, we thought of nothing but taking
our Rest: but this was not the time;
for the Sea was so rough, that the Waves
went over the Ship, and we were wet
from Head to Foot. This, joyn'd with
the excessive Cold, and the Danger we
were in of being cast-away, which the
Seamen themselves fear'd not a little,
cast us into a fresh Concern, till after
much Difficulty and Hazard we got
aboard.</P>
<P>At our leisure we revolv'd all our past
dangers, and presently fell to eating
after hard Fasts; we remain'd some
time in the Road, waiting for Monsieur
<HI>Dancourt,</HI> who was still ashore at <HI>Brest.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="112"/>
On <HI>Sunday,</HI> at Noon, <HI>April</HI> the 12th,
1682. he came Aboard, and immediate∣ly
we Sail'd.</P>
<P>When we were about three Leagues
at Sea, we met the Ship Nam'd the
<HI>Burning,</HI> which lay at Anchor, waiting
the Tide to enter into the Bay of <HI>Brest;</HI>
she was mounted with 80 Guns, and came
from <HI>Havre,</HI> to take Monsieur <HI>de Prouily,</HI>
Lieutenant-General, Aboard, who was
afterwards to Sail to <HI>Algiers.</HI></P>
<P>We Saluted him in the usual manner,
with 7 Guns, and crying out three times
<HI>Vive le Roy;</HI> he answer'd us with as
many, against the usual custom of the
King's Ships, who always return two
Guns less; in all probability, he did it in
complaisance to Monsieur the Intendant,
who was then Aboard him, and who was
Monsieur <HI>Dancourt</HI>'s Friend.</P>
<P>After thanking him with three, we
pursued our way with a North-East
Wind, leaving the Cape to the West,
Steering West-South-West, where we
took the point of our departure, in 48
Degrees 20 Minutes of Southern Lati∣tude,
and in the 11th Degree of Longi∣tude;
but as I am not very expert in
the Art of Navigation, I shall not oblige
<PB N="11" REF="112"/>
my self to be thus exact in these sort of
Observations, but when it is indispen∣sibly
necessary.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday,</HI> the 21th of <HI>April,</HI> we per∣ceiv'd
two Ships to the East of us; by
their Steering to get the Weather-gage
of us, we judg'd them to be Privateers;
we presently put our selves in a posture
of defence, which prevented their ma∣king
any attempt upon us, believing
there was little to be got by us but
Ball.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 26th, in the Morning,
being in 32 Degrees, as many Minutes,
of Northern Latitude, and in 4 Degrees
13 Minutes of Eastern Longitude, we
saw <HI>Cape-Cantin,</HI> the Coast of <HI>Barbary,</HI>
and the Kingdom of <HI>Morocco,</HI> from
whence we were only six Leagues di∣stant;
if the Night had lasted we had
lost our way, for we Sail'd to the West
of the <HI>Maderas,</HI> which is above 140
Leagues thence.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> the 29th, we perceiv'd the
Isle of <HI>Anecerotte,</HI> one of the seven <HI>Ca∣nary</HI>
Islands; which we left about ten
Leagues to the South-East, where we
met with a Calm, and excessive Heat.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="113"/>
<HI>Thursday,</HI> the 30th of <HI>April,</HI> we found
our selves in 28 Degrees 30 Minutes of
Southern Latitude, and 4 Minutes of
Longitude, taking the first Meridian at
the Isle <HI>de Fer,</HI> according to the Custom
of our Nation; so that not being above
ten Leagues distant to the North-East
from the <HI>Great Canary,</HI> we tack'd on
this Isle till Night, about a League off
Land. We could not Anchor by reason
of the little Wind that was stirring, and
the darkness of the following Night;
this oblig'd us to tack about to the East▪
and to keep out at Sea till Three a Clock
in the Morning of the opposite side to
the Land.</P>

<P>But to return to our Journey, which

<P>We left our Beasts in this place, and

Messieurs of the Company have their

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Com∣merce.</NOTE>They give in Exchange to the <HI>Negroes,</HI>
Linnen, Cotton, Copper, Tin, Iron,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The River of <HI>Senegal.</HI></NOTE>The River of <HI>Senegal</HI> is a branch of the

<P>The <HI>Senegal</HI> separates the <HI>Azoaghes,

Pasture for their Cattel; whereas the se∣cond,
that is, the <HI>Negroes,</HI> are fix'd,
and have their certain Towns and Ha∣bitations.</P>
<P>The first are free, and acknowledge

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their dif∣ferent Ge∣nius.</NOTE>The <HI>Moors</HI> are little, meagre, and of a

self into the Sea by two openings, in
15 Degrees 32 Minutes of South Lati∣tude.
Between the Sea and the River,
there is a sort of Dike, or Hill of Sand,
which in the widest part is not above a
little Cannon-shot; this obstacle occa∣sions
continuing its Course for six
Leagues, before it rolls into the Sea, thô
their Waters run even. But as at length
this Dike is pierc'd in two places, three

the Sea; between which an Island is
form'd.</P>
<P>At each of these Mouths, several
Banks of Sand are gather'd, which the
River drives down, and the Sea drives
back, and makes a very dangerous pas∣sage
for Shipping. The continual mo∣tion
of the Sea finding a resistance from
these Banks, causes it to rise to an incre∣dible
heighth, and strands or shatters the

escape for the Equipage, for if they

is, That they still force new Passa∣ges

about twenty Years since, that it forc'd
a passage over against that Island which

Having spoken several times of the
Inundations of the <HI>Niger,</HI> it will be pro∣per
to observe when, and how this hap∣pens;
yet without insisting on Physical
Causes, if happily they may be disco∣ver'd
by particular Circumstances. Be∣hold
such as have appear'd to me.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">When, and how the overflow of the <HI>Ni∣ger</HI> hap∣pens.</NOTE>The Heats are excessive in the <HI>Torrid
Zone,</HI> for it does not Rain there at all,
or, at most, but very little, unless in
the Months of <HI>July, August,</HI> and <HI>Sep∣tember.</HI>
To the South of the Equi∣noctial
Line, the Rains fall earlier, and
in greater abundance, during that time,
and are accompanied with raging Storms,
and follow'd with so great a Calm, and
such excessive Heats, that it's as much
as one can do to fetch ones breath.
Two or three hours after, the Tempest
rallies, and so alternately during the
three Months. This causes violent
Distempers, Fevers, <HI>Cholorae-Morbus,</HI>
Ulcers in the Legs, Worms of four or five
Foot long in the extremities, and fre∣quent
Convulsions, follow'd by Paraly∣ses
and Death.</P>
<P>All that's said of the Causes of the In∣undation
of the River <HI>Nile,</HI> is well
<PB N="45" REF="132"/>
known of all, and therefore I shall not
repeat it here. That of the <HI>Niger</HI> must
have the same Cause, which I believe is,
That the Sun in repassing the Line of
<HI>Cancer,</HI> which in <HI>France</HI> makes the
Summer Solstice, and here the Winter,
amasses the Vapours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cause.</NOTE> which dissolve af∣terwards
in heavy and continual Rains;
and, probably, cause these overflow∣ings.</P>
<P>These Rains commence in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI>
in <HI>April,</HI> continue <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June.</HI> Here
'tis about the 15th of <HI>July,</HI> they encrease
for forty days, and decrease for as many.
This Inundation, which enriches the
Country, is not general, nor extends
beyond the Neighbourhood of the River.
At this time, the Bed of the River is not
known; its Channel neither being deep
enough to contain its Waters; nor ha∣ving
Current enough to sweep them in∣to
the Sea, they drown'd the Valleys
and the lower Grounds, and cover
all.</P>
<P>'Tis dangerous at these times to Sail
on these Rivers, and chiefly on the River
of <HI>Senegal,</HI> unless you understand the
Channel very well; for when the Wa∣ters
come to retire, a Vessel may be left
<PB N="46" REF="133"/>
on an Eminence, or in a deep place,
from whence it can't be drawn out.</P>
<P>It's about 15 Years since a thing hap∣pen'd
that confirms the truth of what I
say:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An at∣tempt to Sail from <HI>Senegal</HI> to <HI>Gambia.</HI></NOTE> Messieurs of the Company, willing
to take the advantage of the Inundation,
sent Barks to discover the Country,
about the place of the separation of these
Arms of the <HI>Niger;</HI> they were willing
to try if it was practicable to pass from
the River of <HI>Senegal</HI> to that of <HI>Gambia;</HI>
the Trade of which, the <HI>English,</HI> who
are Masters of the Mouth of it, hinder
others from, by the means of a Fort
which they have there. And as there
it no attempting this Discovery but at
this time, when, by the advantage of
the Inundation, you pass over Rocks
that are dry at other times, they Mann'd
their Barks with 30 Men, who pass'd al∣most
400 Leagues from our Habitation,
but they encounter'd so many difficul∣ties,
that but five return'd; having once
lost the Bed of the River, their Bark,
amongst others, sat dry on some Trees,
but happily, 'twas not far from the
Chanel; so they made a shift to hale it
into it again.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="133"/>
After Monsieur <HI>Dancourt</HI> had dis∣patch'd

judg'd was most for the advantage of

of a gentle Easterly gale that blew then,
he pass'd it in a Bark design'd for that

sow a little after the Rains; they gather

<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they get the Wine out of the Palm-trees.</NOTE>Through the Incisions which the <HI>Ne∣groes</HI>
make in the Palm-trees, there di∣stils
a Liquor of a Pearl Colour,
which is call'd Palm-Wine; 'tis sweet
and pleasant to drink the first day, but
it will intoxicate; and afterwards it
loses its sweetness, sowering every
day more and more; tho' the older it
is, it still the more affects the Head.
One of these Trees may yield about
three Pints of this Liquor. They com∣monly
regal Strangers with it, and the
most considerable Persons are never
without it: this same Tree produces
a sort of little Coco's, from which they
draw the Punick Oil, of the smell of
Violets, of the taste of Olives, and the
colour of Saffron. It enters into the
Composition of <HI>Musselin</HI> Oil, and <HI>Alex∣andrin
Nicolas.</HI> These Trees pay Cu∣stom
to the <HI>Alzair,</HI> or Lord of the
Town.</P>
<P>As the Palm is high and without
Branches, and that it's necessary to make
Incisions in two or three places below
the leafy tuft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their way of mount∣ing them.</NOTE> (which is the glory of
the Tree,) they climb up after this man∣ner;
they have a sort of a Hoop made
of Brass, which may be ty'd or loosen'd
<PB N="54" REF="138"/>
as one will, into which they enter; they
as 'twere sit upon't, and placing their
Feet against the Tree, supported be∣hind
by this Hoop, as firmly as if they
were on the Ground, they reach the
top, make their Incisions, and fasten the
Basses to receive the Liquor which di∣stils;
'twould frighten one almost to
see them so high, and supported by so
slight a thing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the se∣veral sorts of Animals there.</NOTE>All along the Coast, there is a pro∣digious
variety of Animals, of which I
don't pretend to describe all the several
sorts, being little vers'd in this sort of
Learning, I shall only speak of those I
know, of which one may see a great
number in <HI>Europe,</HI> by the care which
divers Princes have taken to have them
transported, as they are seen there in
their natural wildness, before they are
tam'd; what I am about to say of them,
will perhaps give a more particular Idea
of them.</P>
<P>The greatest numbers of these fierce
Creatures are seen about Ponds and Pits
which the Rains have fill'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Places where they are com∣monly seen.</NOTE> Morning

Onces, Wolves, Tiger-Cats, Ci∣vit-Cats,
Foxes, wild Goats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Ele∣phant.</NOTE>That which is remark'd of the Ele∣phant
is, that he is not to be attack'd
in a place where he may freely turn
himself, else he throws all down with
his Trunk, and treads them to death. I
don't know at what time the Female
brings forth her young, but she has often
three at a time: He lives on Grass and
Leaves, which he conveys to his Mouth
with his trunk; they often pass the
Night in Towns, and so little fear fre∣quented
Places, that instead of avoiding
the <HI>Negroes</HI> Houses, they'll go directly
to them, and toss them out of their way
like Nutshels.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Lion.</NOTE>The Lion seeks his Prey with Art, he
never sets directly upon't, but fetches
a compass, creeping along on the
Ground; and when he is within reach
leaps upon't; he is so mild and man∣ageable
when young, that we have
had of them as tame and familiar as
Dogs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tiger.</NOTE>The <HI>Tiger</HI> is more fierce than the <HI>Li∣on,</HI>
and is much of the same heighth
and length with the <HI>Greyhound,</HI> he sets
indifferently on Men or Beasts; the
<PB N="56" REF="139"/>
<HI>Negroes</HI> kill a great many of them with
their Zagaies and their Arrows to get
their Skins, but tho' wounded near so
much, they still defend themselves, and
seldom fail of <HI>killing some</HI> before they fall.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Leo∣pard.</NOTE>The <HI>Leopard</HI> is fierce and active; un∣less
he meets a Man in a narrow place
where he can't avoid him, he won't set
upon him; but if does, he flies upon
him, fastens his tallons in his Face, and
tears away as much Flesh as they can
grasp, and so kills him. He is a mor∣tal
Enemy of Dogs, and devours them
where-ever he meets them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Once.</NOTE>The <HI>Once,</HI> which is said to be fiercer
than the <HI>Tiger,</HI> is in my Opinion the
same Species, or at least that which we
call a <HI>Panther;</HI> his Skin is more beauti∣ful
than a <HI>Tiger</HI>'s, tho' he is spotted
alike.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tiger-Cat.</NOTE>The <HI>Tiger-Cat</HI> is so nam'd by reason
of his white and black Spots. He is
shap'd like our Cats, only four times as
big; he is of a devouring nature, and
eats <HI>Apes, Rats,</HI> and other Animals.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Civit-Cat.</NOTE>The <HI>Civit-Cat</HI> has the Head and
Snout of a <HI>Fox;</HI> he is large and spotted
like the other, and very wild; every
two days they take the Civit from him,
<PB N="57" REF="139"/>
which is a certain Muscosity, or clam∣my
Sweat which he has under his Tail
in a hollow place.</P>
<P>I have seen no <HI>Rinoceros</HI>'s, tho' there
are some here.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apes, how many sorts.</NOTE>There are several sorts of <HI>Apes,</HI> as
the <HI>Munky,</HI> with a long tail, and the
<HI>Baboon,</HI> who has none at all: I have not
seen of this last sort; as for the first
they abound every where: Of these
there are three sorts, of which two are
very low, and do little mischief. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thoughts of the <HI>Ne∣groes.</HI></NOTE>Of
this little sort, there are some they call
Weepers, having a lamentable sort of a
cry. Of the other sort, there are some
almost as big as <HI>Munkeys,</HI> not only their
Hands and Feet resemble a Man's, but
their very Actions; so that the <HI>Negroes</HI>
say of them, that they can speak if they
will, but that they won't for fear of be∣ing
forc'd to work. They know that
we take delight in them, tho' they are
so mischievous; which I believe gave
occasion to the <HI>Negroes</HI> of <HI>Senegal,</HI> to
bring us Rats in Cages; as if we took
delight in none but mischievous Crea∣tures,
saying, that as our Humour re∣rembled
theirs, 'twas not much to be

a <HI>Tree</HI> out of the Field, and hearkens
and looks about on all sides, while the

soon as ever he perceives any one, he
cries out as loud as ever he can, to give
notice to the rest; who presently at
the Signal, fly with their Prey, leaping
from one <HI>Tree</HI> to another with strange
Agility; the Female, which carries her

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deer in abundance here.</NOTE>They eat a great deal of Veneson

whole Fishes as big as ordinary Carps.
The Cormorants and the Vultures are

<P>I have already spoke of the <HI>Ostridge,</HI>
of which some are of a prodigious size;
those that fly are delicate Meat, and se∣veral
Parts of them are of several tastes;
they are as thick as a Swan, their Fea∣thers
grey and black. The wild Geese
are very good; but the Teal above
all, are of incomparable relish. On
the River <HI>Senegal</HI> the grey exceed the
rest in goodness.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="141"/>
The Partridge perches on the <HI>Trees</HI>
there like other Birds; as do the Hens
which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>Pintades:</HI>
these Hens are speckled white and grey,
having a little red Crest above the Ears;
they are larger than ours; and I look
upon them to be a sort of a Par∣tridge.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parrots.</NOTE>The Parrots there are of two sorts,
the one little, and all green; the other
bigger, have a grey Head, a yellow Bel∣ly,
green Wings, and the Back partly
yellow, partly grey: these never talk,
but the small ones have a sweet clear
voice, &amp; learn whatever they are taught.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observati∣on on the industrious Care of a little Bird.</NOTE>Of all these several sorts of Birds, I
have seen none so industrious and care∣ful,
as a certain little one that builds his
Nest in the Palm-tree after a singular
manner, and by a marvellous instinct,
secures it from the Serpents that creep up
the Trees; they build at the very extre∣mity
of the slightest Branch, to which
they fasten a Stalk of a Rush or Straw,
the strongest they are able to carry, and
about a Foot and a half long, and at the
end which hangs down in the Air they
build their Nests, leaving an Entrance at
the top a little of one side: It looks like a
<PB N="61" REF="141"/>
Ball hanging in the Air. The Branch
to which it is fastned is so weak, that
it can bear nothing that would ap∣proach
to hurt it, and so they are out
of fear.</P>
<P>The Sea is very Fishy all along the

broad and long teeth, in two or three
several rows;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The abun∣dance of Fish.</NOTE> those which they most

that they have two Stomachs, the one at

which performs the Communication
from one to the other: It's fill'd with

reach from the Waist to the Knee:
these Breeches are so large, that they
take up no less than five Ells of Lin∣nen;
they resemble a Womans Petti∣coat

of some our Slaves had: they have
of them before and behind over-against
their Stomachs, large ones, and about
two Inches thick▪ they make some of
them of a Horses Tail, or the Horns of
a Deer, or a wild Bull, cover'd with red
Cloth; they set two of these last on
the forepart of their Caps: thus e∣quipp'd
they have a horrible Air, and
exceeding fierce, and engage one ano∣ther
with the utmost Confidence in
their Combats, but not in those with
us, and against our Muskets; so that
'tis a saying amongst them, That there
is no <HI>Gris-Gris</HI> against the <HI>Pouse;</HI> for
they call the Musket so.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="154"/>
The <HI>Maraboux</HI> ruine them with these
<HI>Gris-Gris</HI>'s; for there are some of them
that cost them three Slaves; others four

they ascribe to them. The Opinion the

made some of our ignorant <HI>French</HI> be∣lieve
there are a great many Conjurers

when these pretended Sorcerers make
a thousand Grimaces, singing and roar∣ing:
as they say, when the Devil beats
them.</P>
<P>When they think any Person is in∣sulted
by the Devil, if it be a Woman,
they put her into Men's Apparrel, with
a Zagage in her Hands, and leads her
singing with a dismal Voice; and by
this Ceremony they believe they drive
him away. I have often observ'd that
these suppos'd Sorcerer<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are mere

the Ceremony of Circumcision, which

they don't perform till the Child's ele∣ven

cuts the Foreskin, which the Person Cir∣cumcis'd

Father is oblig'd to take her again, if
the Husband requires it, and to restore
him his Oxen. But this rarely hap∣pens;
for by an unlawful knowledge
before Marriage, they are assur'd what
she is: But, if she is return'd again,
she is not the more despis'd; for, tho'
she be not a Wife for one, yet she may
be a Concubine for another; so the
Father still gets more and more by
her: So by this accursed Gain, he might
as innocently murder his Daughter. If
afterwards the Husband grows weary
of his Wife, he puts her away, and is
quit of her, losing his Dowry: And she

A <HI>Marabou</HI> washes the Corpse of

him, and ask him a great many
ridiculous Questions; If he was not
well with them? What harm they did
him? If he had not Riches enough?
If he had not handsom Wives enough?
and the like: And, seeing he makes no

for others, who repeat the same Que∣stions,
while the <HI>Guiriot</HI>'s incessantly
sing his Praises.</P>
<P>And because 'tis the Custom to make
much of all those who come to com∣pliment
the Dead, they kill Oxen, and
sell his Slaves, that they may have
<HI>Aqua-Vitae</HI> to be merry withal. When
the Assistants are well satisfied, they
bury the Dead in the House where he

died, of which they open the Dome.
Afterwards, when the Corpse is in the
Ground, the Mourners re-double their
Cries, and four Persons making a Square,
with four Callicoes which they hold,
hide him so as he can't be seen.</P>
<P>The <HI>Marabou</HI> comes afterwards, and
speaks some Words in the Ears of the
Dead, and covers him with a Calico;
and afterwards they put the Dome in
its place; on which they hang some
Clothes, white, red, or any other Co∣lour
they fansie. Hard by they set up
a Pole, on which they hang the Bow,
the Quiver, and the Zagages of the
defunct. They set him a Pot of <HI>Cos∣couse,</HI>
and another of Water, which is
his Provision for one Year; for they
fansie he eats after he is dead.</P>
<P>In some Places they compass the

it. This being finish'd, the Mourn∣ers

like the Stone which the Mower makes

withal.</P>
<P>Whatever they are a doing their lit∣tle
Ones are always ty'd up behind
them, even when they are pounding
their Mill; whence 'tis, that they have
all great Bellies and flat Noses, for the
Mother bowing and raising her Body
as she beats, makes them strike their
Noses against her Back; which the
Children endeavouring to avoid (which
notwithstanding they hardly can) hold∣ing
themselves back, they advance
their Bellies: I believe this is the on∣ly
Reason that the <HI>Negroes</HI> are flat
Nos'd.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="159"/>
They value Beauty as much as we,

as any of our <HI>European</HI> Ladies. And
are more witty than the Men, but ve∣ry

these Dames being very Mercenary,
they will not grant them Favours for
nothing, although their Husbands con∣sent

<P>But 'tis not so amongst one another;

their Revenge.</P>

These last in dancing hold one

advancing the upper part of their

both sail and row. When the Wind
is high, and the Water rough, the Ca∣noo
often overturns, but they little
mind it, for they are good swimmers,
&amp; it does not sink to the bottom, so they
easily set it right again in the Water,
and then get into it as if nothing had
happen'd: But row in them with such
speed, that the lightest of our Sloops
can't overtake them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their way of Fishing.</NOTE>When they go a Fishing, commonly
they don't go above two in a Canoo.
They launch out as good as six Leagues
into the Sea, and for the most part fish
with a Line; but as there are great
Fishes which won't bite at a Bait, they
strike them with Irons pointed like
the Head of an Arrow, or with long
Sticks sharpned at the end, and of the
length of a Halp-Pike, with a Cord
fasten'd to it, with which they
draw them to Land, after wounding
them.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="161"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their neg∣lect to pre∣serve their Fish.</NOTE>They dry the little Fish like Sardins,
and they open the great ones, as they
do Cod. As they don't salt them, they
commonly stink before they dry; but
'tis then they reckon them most deli∣cious,
for they don't love fresh Fish.
They sell it to those who live up land;
and would from them make great ad∣vantage
of it, if they'd take the Pains
of carrying it to the Towns; but the
others being as lazy to fetch it, as they
are to carry it, betwixt them both
the Fish stinks, and becomes useless.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Markets.</NOTE>Besides their Trade with us, they keep particular Markets for themselves,
but trivial, that I have admir'd to see
them come six or seven Leagues with
a little Cotton, some Callicoes, Beans,
Gourds, Palm, Pallets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Another
time I saw a Man come six Leagues to
bring a Bar of Iron half of a Foot
long.</P>
<P>Not but that sometimes one meets
there with Goods of greater value, as
Rings of Gold, and Gold Ear-Rings,
nam'd by them <HI>Dougaret,</HI> of the same
Metal, but it's in so small a quantity,
that in the whole Market you shan't
<PB N="95" REF="161"/>
find to the value of fifty Pistols. For∣merly
they dealt wholly by the way
of exchanging one thing for another,
but since their Commerce with the <HI>Eu∣ropeans,</HI>
instead of Money they Trade
with Rastade, and little Glass Baubles,
and Iron Bars. The best Things they
bring us in these Markets, (which they
keep at the end of some Town) is E∣lephants
Teeth, Bullocks Hides, and
some Slaves, which they come to <HI>Goree</HI>
to sell; and for which Messiears of the
Company give them Iron, <HI>Aqua-Vitae,</HI>
Rassade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which they make a
considerable Gain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Go∣vernment Heredita∣ry.</NOTE>The Government there is Heredita∣ry and Monarchical, yet 'tis not the
Sons of the King who succeed, but his
Nephews, his Sisters Sons. This Cu∣stom,
which may seem a little odd, is
grounded on this Reason, That 'tis not
certain that the Children the Prince
has by his Wives are really his; where∣as
it being undeniable, that the Chil∣dren
of his Sisters are certainly hers;
and so it follows, that they are rather
of the Blood Royal than his own.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="162"/>
When the Prince comes to the
Throne, every Body strives to Congra∣tulate
him, because he has carried it from
his Brothers; of whom there being
commonly many, the Empire always
becomes contested, and falls to him that
has the greatest Force and the best Suc∣cess.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the King is approach'd.</NOTE>The King is approach'd with Diffi∣culty and Reverence; and few are ad∣mitted
into the Heart of his Court.
When any great Lord, tho' he be his
Relation, would have Audience of him,
he pulls off his Frock at his entrance
into the Court, being quite naked from
the Waist upwards; when he draws
near the place where the King is, he
throws himself on his Knees, afterwards
bows his Head, and with his both
Hands strews Sand on his Face and
Head, then rises, and repeats the same
Ceremony often at such a distance, till
he comes within two steps of the King:
Being there, he stops, and declares the
Motives he had for demanding Audi∣ence:
His Compliment ended, which
is made on the Knee, he rises without
daring to look at the King, resting his
<PB N="97" REF="162"/>
Hands on his Knees, and from time to
time sling Sand on his Forehead.</P>
<P>The Prince, who carries it very high
to his Subjects, makes a shew as if he
scarce heard him, and so diverts him∣self
with something else; yet, however,
at last, he vouchsafes him a short An∣swer,
with excessive Gravity. And
then the Suppliant rejoyns the Courtiers
who are found there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Ab∣solute and Respected he is.</NOTE>I don't believe there are any Kings in the World more Absolute, and more
Respected than the <HI>Negroes,</HI> which pro∣ceeds
from their Severity; for on the
least Offence of the Subject, an Order
is sent to behead him; all his Goods
are confifcated, and his whole Family
enslaved. The middle sort are happier
than the Great, being subject only to
Captivity on these Occasions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who are well re∣ceiv'd by the King.</NOTE>The <HI>Azoaghes,</HI> the <HI>Maraboux,</HI> and the
<HI>French,</HI> have much more Liberty than
the <HI>Negroes;</HI> and we a great deal more
than these. When the <HI>Europeans</HI> ap∣proach
him, they salute him with Re∣verence;
and he presents them his Hand
to lay it on theirs. At this time he ei∣ther
<PB N="98" REF="163"/>
sits or lies after the Fashion of the
<HI>Negroes,</HI> on a Bed, spread with a Quilt,
cover'd with red Leather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How much he loves Presents.</NOTE> with a Pipe
in his Mouth; he makes them sit down
by him, and asks what they have
brought along with them.</P>
<P>As we never have these Audiences
but when we have some Favour to re∣quest
of him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Pre∣sents are brought him.</NOTE> or to complain of his Of∣ficers,
or of some Injuries offer'd the
<HI>Whites,</HI> we never come without Pre∣sents;
which commonly consists in ten
or twelve Pots of <HI>Aqua-Vitae,</HI> a little
Sugar, some Garlick, five or six Ells
of Linnen, and some bits of Coral.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark on the Recep∣tion of En∣voys.</NOTE>When an Envoy has any thing about him that pleases the King, as Coat,
Stockings, Shooes, Sword, or Hat; he
desires to try them, and then makes
them his own; he did thus a little af∣ter
our arrival to an Envoy of Monsieur
<HI>Dancourt;</HI> from whom he took a Bro∣card
Waistcoat, his Stockings, Hat, and
Shooes; so that he had been forc'd to
return naked, if by chance he had not
carried other Cloaths with him, that
were of a lesser value than the other.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="163"/>
While the <HI>Aqua-Vitae</HI> lasts, he is never
sober; so that their's no expecting an
Answer, till it's all out; when he is sober
he dismisses the Envoy, giving him two
or three Slaves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pre∣sents of the King of the <HI>Ne∣groes.</HI></NOTE> which he sends to his
Guards to take away at the first Vil∣lage.
Miserable are they who fall un∣der
their Hands at that time, for they
never stand to chuse, but the first at
hand serves the present Occasion.</P>
<P>Whatever Care one takes to supply
ones self with Provisions when one
comes to solicite any thing at this
Court; yet you run the risk of star∣ving;
for the King demands them; and
eats above one half himself; and in re∣turn,
he gives you a Kid, or a quarter of
a Cammel, which is very ill Food, a
little <HI>Coscouse,</HI> and some Palm-wine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on the Inju∣stice of the <HI>Negro</HI> Kings.</NOTE>While I was in this Country, a plea∣sant
thing happen'd; which shews the
Power that Presents have over these
Kings, and what little Regard they have
to Justice: Two little Tributary Kings
to <HI>Damel,</HI> were at strife concerning the
Succession to a little poor Sovereignty;
they were Brother and Son to the late
<PB N="100" REF="164"/>
Prince, and bottom'd their Pretensions
on divers Reasons, too tedious, and too
inconsiderable to be mention'd here.
They propos'd to end their Difference
by force, or the King's decision; the
King having forbid the first, they
were forc'd to stand to his Judg∣ment.</P>
<P>On the Day appointed for giving
Judgment in their Difference, the two
Parties met in the great Place before
the Court, accompanied with great
Numbers, that seem'd to form two Bat∣talions,
about thirty Yards distant from
one another; they were arm'd with
Darts, Bows, Zagages, Javelins, and Mo∣risco
Knives; the King follow'd by six
hundred Men, accoutred with their <HI>Gris-Gris</HI>'s,
appear'd mounted on a fine <HI>Bar∣bary</HI>
Horse, and so plac'd himself be∣twixt
the two Rivals.</P>
<P>Tho' they all spoke the same Lan∣guage,
yet they made use of Interpre∣ters,
who told the King again what
they heard. The Son of the deceas'd
ended his Discourse, in remonstrating
to him, That seeing it had pleased GOD
to bestow the Sovereignty in dispute
on his Father, the Right of it now be∣long'd
<PB N="101" REF="164"/>
to him, which he hop'd his Ma∣jesty
would confirm to him. The King
having heard him attentively, said to
him with an Air full of Gravity, GOD
has given it you, and I give it you a∣gain
after him.</P>
<P>Such an Answer presently dispers'd
the Party of the Uncle, who retir'd
all alone. The <HI>Guiriot</HI>'s with their In∣struments
and their Drums, celebrated
the Praises of the Victorious, saying to
him, You best deserv'd it, the King
has done you Justice; for you are more
Handsom, more Rich, and more Valiant
than he.</P>
<P>While this poor Prince thought to
enjoy his Happiness, he was surpris'd
to see himself stripp'd next morning of
this▪ Sovereignty, with which he was
newly Invested; for his Uncle losing
no time, made such a noble Present to
the King, that he forgot that of his Ne∣phew,
and dispossess'd him in the Morn∣ing
of that which he had given him
the Night before, Installing the other in
his Place. This change of Fortune
made the <HI>Guiriots</HI> change their Note,
and now bestow'd all their Praises on
him whom they despis'd before: Such
<PB N="102" REF="165"/>
is the Perfidiousness both of Prince and
Subject.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What is the Conduct of the King when he goes a Pro∣gress.</NOTE>To return to what concerns the King in particular; when he goes a
Progress he has no need of Vivandiers,
for he is provided for, by the several
Villages, through which he passes. They
serve him up sometimes 50 wooden
Dishes of <HI>Causcouse,</HI> season'd after seve∣ral
ways; he receives those which agree
with his Pallate, and gives the rest to
his Attendants, who are frequently as
hungry after Dinner as before; for you
must know, they have all great Sto∣machs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ne∣groes</HI> man∣ner of eat∣ing.</NOTE>They all eat very nastily, lying a∣long
on the Ground, taking it up by
handfuls; making no use either of
Napkins or Plates. No Body eats with
the King but the Grand <HI>Marabou,</HI> or one
of the most accomplish'd Lords, and
very often he eats alone.</P>
<P>He will by no means suffer the <HI>Thou∣babes</HI>
(for so he calls us) to see him at
Meals; I believe he conceals himself
from us, as believing we eat better, and
with more Decency than his Custom
will allow; or rather, that he is a∣sham'd
<PB N="103" REF="165"/>
of his Poverty. Amongst the
meaner sort, all of a Family eat toge∣ther:
Their first Dish is <HI>Couscouse,</HI> and
when they have done with that, they
fall aboard the Flesh, which they tear
in Pieces with their Fingers, making no
use at all of their Knives; and after
they have gnaw'd it, they put it into
the Dish again for the next. They
use only their Right-hand in eating;
which is always at Noon and Night;
for they reserve the Left-hand wholly
for Labour, and on that account they
esteem it an Indecency to eat with it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Officers of King <HI>Damel.</HI></NOTE>The King has several Ministers of State under him, who assist him in the
Government, and in the Exercise of
Justice. <HI>Condy,</HI> who is a Tributary So∣vereign,
is after the manner of our
Constable, and is General of his Forces,
the Grand <HI>Geraff</HI> is the chief Justice
throughout all the Dominions of King
<HI>Damel;</HI> he goes the Circuits from time
to time to execute Justice, and hear
the Complaints of the People; and he
generally does Justice out of hand, for
he punishes a Thief with Slavery. It
being a rarity for a Man of a mean
<PB N="104" REF="166"/>
Condition to be inflicted with the Pu∣nishment
of Death.</P>
<P>The King's <HI>Alzari</HI> Exercises the same
Employ as the <HI>Geraff,</HI> but his Power is
more limitted: He has under him <HI>Al∣katies</HI>
or <HI>Alkairs</HI> of great Villages, that
are as particular Lords of them.</P>
<P>When a <HI>Negro</HI> is accus'd of any
Crime, of which he can't easily be con∣victed,
in order to his Justification, they
oblige him to lick a red-hot Iron three
times: If it burns him, he is reputed
guilty; if not, he and his Accuser
leaves the Court, and the Process falls
without Costs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How and for what the <HI>Negro</HI> Kings make upon one ano∣cher.</NOTE>The <HI>Negro</HI> Kings go to War with one another on every small Pretext. And
when any such Occasion happens, the
<HI>Condy</HI> assembles all the great Lords, and
the rest of the Subjects; of which he
composes his Cavalry and his Infantry.
They seldom have a Body of above 12
or 1500 Men, so that their War is on∣ly
a sort of Skirmishing Excursion. In
all the Kingdom of <HI>Damel</HI> you can
scarce raise 200 Horse: The Men of
Quality in the Army, especially the
<PB N="105" REF="166"/>
Horse, are loaded with <HI>Gris-Gris,</HI> as I
have already observed; so that when
they are once dismounted, they are not
able to march four paces on foot.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arms of the Horse.</NOTE>Their Horse are arm'd with Zagayes,
which is a sort of a Dart, long and
large, with three or four Spears, bigger
than those of Arrows, and have several
small Hooks, that tears open the wound
when they draw it. They can cast
these Zagayes a great way, and go ve∣ry
rarely without them: Besides these
they have a Cimeter, and a Morisco
Knife, about half a Yard long, and two
Inches wide: They guard the Blows
with a round Buckler made of thick
Leather; and tho' they are encumbred
with so many Utensils, yet they have
their Hands and Arms at liberty, and
can fight smartly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arms of the Foot.</NOTE>The Foot are arm'd with a Cime∣ter,
a Javelin, and a Quiver fill'd with
fifty or sixty poison'd Arrows, that
wound mortally, if they are not im∣mediately
seer'd with hot Irons.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="167"/>
The Teeth of their Iron-headed Ar∣row
produces another miserable ef∣fect;
for they can't be drawn back,
without making the Wound more dan∣gerous
than before.</P>
<P>Their Bow is made of a Cane, re∣sembling
that which we call a <HI>Bamboo.</HI>
That which they make use of for the
String, is another sort of Wood, very
curiously fitted up for that purpose.
They are so dextrous in shooting out
of Bows, that at fifty Yards distance
they'll hit a Mark, the breadth of a
Crown piece. They march without a∣ny
order of Discipline, even in the E∣nemies
Country. The <HI>Guiriot</HI>'s excite
them to Battel by the sound of their
Instruments.</P>
<P>As soon as they are within shot, the
Infantry discharge their Arrows, and
the Horse cast their Javelins. This
discharge is follow'd with blows of
Zagayes. They spare their Enemies as
much as possible, that they may make
the more Slaves; from which their Per∣sons
of Quality are not exempted. And
as they are naked and expert in the
using their Bows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> their Wars are
<PB N="107" REF="167"/>
always very Bloody. They are very
resolute, and had rather lose their Lives,
that be guilty of the least Cowardice.
The despight that is show'd to a Cow∣ard
amongst them, and the fear of lo∣sing
their Liberty, does very much aug∣ment
their Courage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their way making Peace.</NOTE>Their first shock being over, they
often renew it again for two or three
Days together; afterwards send a <HI>Ma∣rabou</HI>
of each side to treat of a Peace.
When they have agreed on the Con∣ditions,
they swear upon the <HI>Alcoran,</HI>
and by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> to the observing
them; tho' they know very little of
the one or the other. The Prisoners
on either side receive no Benefit of the
Treaty, but continue Slaves as if the
War was eternal.</P>
<P>See here the best Account I cou'd
give of these Countries, if I can dis∣cover
any Thing farther, before my

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wood of <HI>Matte∣formose.</HI></NOTE>On the Entrance of the River of St. <HI>Domingo</HI> to the South, is a large
Wood called <HI>Matteformose;</HI> and a Vil∣lage

before: With whom a Trade is
maintain'd for Slaves and Provisions,
but chiefly for great Quantities of
Rice.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="173"/>
Going up the River about two
Leagues, you meet with a small Rivo∣let,
which is not Navigable, but sepa∣rates
the <HI>Flouppes</HI> from the <HI>Papels.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Papels</HI> Sacrifice.</NOTE>The <HI>Papels</HI> are <HI>Pagan Negroes,</HI> all
Idolaters, as the former. They have a
King who dwels five or six Leagues
from them: When any considerable
Person dies, they sacrifice Bullocks,
Cows, Kids, and Capon to their Gods,
which are for the most part one or
more Trees, the Horn of an Ox, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Town of <HI>Ca∣cheau.</HI></NOTE>In the same Road, about four Leagues
higher, you find the Town of <HI>Ca∣cheau;</HI>
now in the Hands of the <HI>Portu∣guese,</HI>
who have three Forts there; the
chief of which may have about ten or
twelve Guns, and the other two, three,
or four each. A Captain-Major has
the Government of it, who has a de∣pendance
on the Governor of <HI>Cape
Verd,</HI> they are every Year recruited
with thirty or forty <HI>Portnguese</HI> Soldi∣ers,
who are generally banish'd Crimi∣nals;
they supplying the Places of those

by necessity, or by an over addicting

themselves to Women. 'Tis design'd
them a Place of Exile, tho' they often
find it happy enough. There may be
about three hundred Inhabitants in the
Town, who are for the most part <HI>Mul∣lato</HI>'s;
the other may have Wives or
Concubines.</P>
<P>There is in the Town a Receiver of
the King's Customs; for the Ships that
come to traffick there pay ten <HI>per Cent.</HI>
for coming in and going out. There is
a <HI>Grefferi</HI> or Writer, who holds the
Place both of Publick Notary and She∣riff:
'tis the Governor who administers
Justice. There is a Parochial Church,
a Curate, and a Visitator, who is in the
Nature of the great Vicar of <HI>France;</HI>
for he always makes Visitations on be∣half
the Bishop of St. <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>There is also a Convent of <HI>Capuchins,</HI>
where there are seldom more than three
or four Religious.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the <HI>Town</HI> have
little Boats and Barks, in which they
trade on the Rivers of <HI>Nonne, Pougues,
Serlione,</HI> and to the Islands of the <HI>Beza∣gots,</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="174"/>
where they have a great Com∣merce
with Wax, Slaves, and some small
pieces of Ivory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Town of <HI>Farim.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> have yet another <HI>Town,</HI> a great way higher up the River,
about one hundred and fifty Leagues
from <HI>Cacheau,</HI> call'd <HI>Farim,</HI> pallasodo'd
round; but the Inhabitants are not so
numerous as at <HI>Cacheau;</HI> tho' the grea∣test
part of them, have Somer-Houses
here, where their <HI>Gourmet's</HI> make Ca∣lico's,
and some small quantities of Wax.
There is also a Curate, and a Captain-Major▪
who is dependant on the <HI>Town</HI>
of <HI>Cacheau.</HI> The <HI>Negroes</HI> that inhabit
the adjacent Countries are call'd <HI>Mau∣dingues:</HI>
All the Villages from <HI>Cacheau</HI>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Three Islands.</NOTE>Going Southward out of the River of St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> you meet several Islands,
the first is call'd the <HI>Three Islands,</HI> which
effectively has that Figure. Possessed
by the <HI>Gourmots</HI> or <HI>Negroes,</HI> who have
freed themselves from the Slavery of
the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> and most of them, tho'
<PB N="121" REF="174"/>
they are baptis'd, have renounc'd the
Catholick Faith. They cultivate this
Island, which produces great store of
Cotton, of which they make their
Cloth. They have Cannoo's to serve
them in their Traffick with the <HI>Negroes</HI>
ofthe Continent. The Place which
they pass is call'd the <HI>Bott.</HI> They are
very careful not to let any Vessels or
Barks approach their Island.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of <HI>Bussi.</HI></NOTE>Over-against it is the Island of <HI>Bussi,</HI>
in Possession of the <HI>Papels,</HI> who have a
King not very Absolute. The Sea is
so shallow there, that one may pass to
it without being up to the mid-leg.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Trea∣chery.</NOTE>'Tis dangerous trading with them,
till their ways are throughly known;
for their strange mistrust, makes them
believe there is no Sincerity in us. I
know that several <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI>
have been there massacred for endea∣vouring
to trade with them. They a∣bound
in Provisions, as Oxen, Foul,
Fish, Mill, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but they are of a very
indifferent relish. Their Island is about
ten Leagues in Circuit, and has two
Ports, the one to the East, which is
<PB N="122" REF="175"/>
call'd <HI>Old Port;</HI> the other to the South,
which call'd <HI>White-stone Harbour.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Village of <HI>Caze∣lut.</HI></NOTE>Right over-against it, is the Village of <HI>Cazelut,</HI> and many small Islands,
which are not inhabited. Very near it
you find the Island of <HI>Bisseaux,</HI> about
two Leagues distant. A Vessel of three
hundred <HI>Tun</HI> may pass betwixt them
both, if the Channel be well known.
'Tis about forty Leagues in compass;
the <HI>Papel Negroes</HI> that inhabit it are al∣most
all <HI>Pagans.</HI> There are in this
Island nine Kings; which one is supe∣rior
to the other eight; which proper∣ly
are no more than Deputy Gover∣nors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cru∣elty when any of their Kings die.</NOTE>When any of the King's die, they
take care to strangle above thirty Per∣sons,
chiefly the young Girls, and those
Slaves that have been the most faith∣ful
to the Deceas'd, whom they bury
along with them. They put with him
into his <HI>Tomb</HI> all his Riches, as his Gold,
Silver, Amber Gris, Stuffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="175"/>
When they chuse another 'tis after
this manner;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they elect their Kings.</NOTE> they are only the <HI>Gearges</HI>
that make Pretensions, which are, as I
may say, the Dukes and Peers of
<HI>France.</HI> They gather together in a
Ring, in the middle of which is the
<HI>Tomb</HI> of the deceas'd King, made of
Reeds and very light Wood, which is
sustain'd in the Air by several <HI>Negroes,</HI>
who in dancing toss it up, and he on
whom it falls, they chuse for their
King in the room of the Deceas'd:
they often sacrifice to their Gods,
Bullocks, Capons, Kids, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There
are several good Harbours in this I∣sland,
the best of which is call'd <HI>Port-Risseaux,</HI>
where Ships of sixty Guns
may ride at Anchor in safety. The
King's Palace is within half a League
of it: there is one Parish, and a Con∣vent
of <HI>Capuchins;</HI> several of the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI>
are married to the <HI>Negresses</HI> of
the Country.</P>
<P>There are several of those Heathens
Sons have received Baptism, and em∣brac'd
the Catholick Doctrine. The
King has his Guards, his Army, and se∣veral
<PB N="124" REF="176"/>
Women of all Ages. He has a-about
fifty Cannoo's of War man'd with
about thirty Men each. For their
Arms they have only a Cimiter hang∣ing
on their Shoulders by a short Belt.
And are Cloath'd only with the Skin
of a Kid, which hangs loose behind,
and is fasten'd before betwixt their
Legs, to hide their Nudities. They
go to War agaiust the <HI>Biaffares,</HI> who
inhabited the Continent, twice or thrice
a Year.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Arms and Habit.</NOTE>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> formerly built a Fort there, mounted with eight Guns, to hin∣der
Strangers from coming to that Isle,
that they might engross it all to them∣selves:
But the <HI>Negroes</HI> will not suffer
it, for they are all Sticklers for the Li∣berties
of their Country, which occa∣sions
a welcome to all manner of
Strangers, that come to traffick in their
Ports, who may Negotiate in the I∣sland
with all imaginable Security,
without dreading any Insult, if you
offer none. When you arrive at their
Ports, you are not suffer'd to land
till the King has a sacrifis'd a Bul∣lock;
<PB N="125" REF="176"/>
which done, you have liberty to
disembark.</P>
<P>Just over-against the Port is an Island
call'd <HI>Sortiere,</HI> full of <HI>Trees,</HI> where the

Year, in which the King him∣self
assists. Vessels anchor very safely

OF THE
River <HI>GEVA.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Geva.</HI></NOTE>THE River of <HI>Geva</HI> winds it self about 70 Leagues into the Con∣tinent,
from North-East to South-West.
All the Villages of either side (which
are about a League from the Sea) are
inhabited by the <HI>Biaffares.</HI> At the En∣trance
of the River, towards the North,
is a Village call'd <HI>Gouffode,</HI> about a
League from the Harbour: there it is
where Bullocks and Poultry are to
be sold; and they also traffick for some
Slaves.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="177"/>
On the same River, abous five Leagues
higher, is the Town of <HI>Geva;</HI> the
greatest part is possessed by the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI>
and <HI>Gournets,</HI> which is encompass'd
with Pallasadoes.</P>
<P>They have a Parish-Church, a Cu∣rate,
and a Captain who commands
them, and is dependent on the Gover∣nor
of <HI>Cacheau:</HI> The adjacent Places
are inhabited by the <HI>Negro Biaffares;</HI>
most of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> have Barks in the
Port, in which they trade to <HI>Serlienne,</HI>
with a sort of Fruit call'd <HI>Cocters,</HI> which
both in shape and taste resembles the
<HI>Marous</HI> of <HI>India;</HI> they are both white
and red, for which they drive a great
trade, especially with the <HI>Biaffares</HI> and
<HI>Mandingues.</HI> They also send their Barks
to trade with the <HI>Bizagot Negroes</HI> on
the River <HI>Nounne</HI> for Elephants Teeth,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Indigo in the Leaf, which they die
their Cloaths with.</P>
<P>The Barks can go no higher than
<HI>Goree;</HI> but their Cannoo's will go up
several little Rivers of small note. Just
over-against the Port you meet with
<PB N="128" REF="178"/>
several little Islands, especially that of
<HI>Boulam;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of <HI>Boulam.</HI></NOTE> well stock'd with Trees, and
about six Leagues in compass, lying
just at the Entrance of the River <HI>Rio∣grando,</HI>
but not inhabited. The other
Islands are so inconsiderable, I do not
think it worth while to mention them.
I shall say nothing of <HI>Cape-Verd, Sene∣gal,</HI>
or the <HI>Canary Islands,</HI> understanding
that the Sieur <HI>le Maire,</HI> with the Assi∣stance
of Monsieur <HI>D' Ancourt</HI> has said
