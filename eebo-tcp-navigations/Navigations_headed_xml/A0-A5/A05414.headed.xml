<HEAD><HI>TO THE RIGHT WOR∣shipfull, my singular good Vn∣cle, Richard Lewkenor, Sergeant</HI> at the Law.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Emperour <HI>Claudius</HI> made an inuiolable decree, that whatsoeuer bondman in <HI>Rome,</HI> being manu∣mitted, and set free from seruilitie, if he neglecting the loue and bountie of his friend that did enfranchise him, requited him at any time with vn∣kindnes, he should be againe reduced to his former bonde and slauish condition. Whereby most euidently appeareth, that this inhumaine and barbarous vice ingratitude, hath beene euen of wicked men in all ages detested and abhorred: but to the vertuous and best disposed persons, hath it euer beene so extreamely odious, that they haue left to their posterity innu∣merable multitude of examples, for the rooting out of so con∣sagious a pestilence from all societies: VVherefore to cleare my selfe from all suspition of any guilte or faultines herein, which you (my singular good Vnckle) most iustlie may con∣ceiue against me, for letting slip so many proffered occasions, and deferring so much time before I present some essentiall

testimony of my dearest loue, and most dutifull affection to your Worshippe: hauing run into so deepe adebt, for many &amp; those no meane curtisies receyued at your bandes, I haue at last, I fear, too and atiously attempted to straine the small &amp; slender talent, which I haue to pleade my cause in this behalfe, most humbly beseeching you now to shew your accustomed hu∣manity in pardoning the defectes, wherewith these my simple labours are disgraced and blemished through my owne vn∣skilfulnes, and want of learning, which of it selfe will easilie appear, in laying open to your iudicial &amp; cleare seeing view, a learned subiect in so naked cloathing, I meane a worhy trea∣tise in so disioynted, harsh, and vnpolished a stile: howbeit I most humbly beseech you not to measure the earnest zeale &amp; dutifull affection I beare you by this simple testimony, where∣by I goe about to shew it, but rather vouchsafe to know how greatly I am ashamed, that my abilitie can afforde no better meanes, nor my inuention, as yet bring forth a better present, fit to be offered vp to so learned a sur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay. But yet if it please you to allow of this my simple trauel, such as it is, and thinke it worthy of your patronage: I most faithfully do promise hereafter to imploy the vttermost of my endeuours in amen∣ding of this faulie, and shall from henceforth the better bee enocuraged to assay some matter of greater moment, and more worthy of your protection. Vouchsafe therefore gra∣tiously to accept these my gatheringes and gleaninges out of other mens haruestes, a worke though not greatly profitable, yet pleasant and pithie, which I haue garnished with sondrie excel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent histories, and I dare boldly promise that you looking thereon at some idle howers for your recreation, shall finde therin some pleasur &amp; content, the rather because no man to my knowledge hath euer assayed the same before, &amp; for that

<HEAD>To the gentle and curteous <HI>Reader.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Had no sooner begun (gentle Rea∣der) to take this taske in hand, but entring into a true and iudiciall consideration how weake &amp; slen∣der my forces were to bring to any good perfection a work of so great moment and importance, I began immediately to faint &amp; fall vnder my burthen, know∣ing that by perseuering therein, I should but set forth vnto the view of this captious age mine owne vnskil∣fulnesse, and euer liue obnoxious to the malicious tongs of such barking mastifes, as thinke the reproofe of other mens labors to be the greatest parcell of their owne praises, though then themselues none are more ignorant. Notwithstanding, being at last earnestly entreated to finish what I had begun, and the same be∣ing finished, vehemently vrged to the publication thereof, by some friends of mine whome I am bound by dutie to obey, since of two euils wise men are wont to chuse the least, I thought it better to lay open to the world my follies, and discouer mine owne vnlear∣ned ignorance, then by curious and nice reiecting the aduised counsel, &amp; enforcing perswasions of my dea∣rest &amp; nearest friends, to be touched or thought guilty
<PB REF="4"/>
of that fowle and of all good men detested vice ingra∣titude.</P>
<P>But least any one looking in this booke for the de∣scription of our English Academies, and finding them placed in the latter end, shold by a misconstruction of my well meaning intention lay vnto my charge either negligence, or ignorance, or both, for not giuing vnto these two noble nurseries of the artes (whose resplen∣dent fame hath dilated it selfe to the vttermost con∣fines of the earth) their due &amp; deserued places, I will for his satisfaction &amp; mine own excuse speake onely a word or two. I am not ignorant, that these vniuersities of our natiue country deserue for their degree &amp; wor∣thinesse to be placed in the foremost ranke, and that in all <HI>Europe</HI> are not to be found more ancient, more magnificent, more plentifull, better accommodated, nor more in all kinds of learning flourishing vniuersi∣ties. But so great of late haue beene the controuersies, and so sharpe and bitter the contentions betweene the learned Doctors &amp; professors in either of these sacred, and most worthily renowned habitations of the Mu∣ses: while they of eyther side with tooth and naile did labour to maintaine the prioritie of that place where∣in they had remained students, that I as one weakely armed, and fearing the encounter, not daring to des∣cend into the listes, was once determined plainely to giue ouer the fielde: for with what face shoulde I by any meanes presume (my learning being little, and my skill in the arte of antiquaries lesse) to interpose my poore opinion, among the stifly maintained allegations of so many graue &amp; learned men? I there∣fore
<PB REF="5"/>
was resolued rather to bee accused and bla∣med of ignorance for leauing of them out, then by going about to giue superioritie vnto the one, to in∣curre the displeasure of the other. But being againe aduised how great a maime &amp; blemish I should seeme to giue vnto this present treatise, if going about to in∣corporate in one bodie the moderne vniuersities of our Christian world, I should cut off two of the most noble and principall limmes or members of the same: I haue at last (altering my first resolution) annexed them to the end thereof, in such manner, as neither of these vniuersities shall finde cause of discontent∣ment, and the curious reader depart (as I hope) well satisfied.</P>
<P>Concerning the antiquities, priuiledges, and e∣rection of colledges in the one and the other, I write nothing of mine owne inuention, what I haue found in <HI>M. Camdens</HI> Chorographicall description of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> concerning <HI>Oxforde,</HI> and other Chronicles, that haue I gathered and set downe, to <HI>Cambridge</HI> some thinges haue I added not of my self, but extracted out of certaine papers, printed in Paules Churchyearde, in the yeare of our Lorde, one thousand fiue hundred, seauenty two, and written by a learned Maister of that Vniuersity.</P>
<P>Accept therefore (curteous Reader) in good part what here thou findest offered to thy view, and dis∣courage me not with thy frowne in my first attempt: the faultes that are herein escaped, if they proceede from the authors vnskilfulnes, forgiue them, conside∣ring that he is one that hath more vsually beene ac∣quainted
<PB REF="5"/>
with the warlike sounde of martiall drums, then with the schooles and Lectures of Philoso∣phy: if committed by the Printer, amend them gentlie with thy penne, so shall I euer rest.</P>

Whereby occasion was giuen for new townes to be builded, &amp; their countries con∣quered to be more assured to the conquerors thereof. The Romaines, a people excelling in all kinds of poli∣cie and discipline, obseruing this order, when they had placed their victorious ensignes in <HI>Germanie,</HI> that they might with greater securitie defend and keepe the same, which with great trauaile they had atchie∣ued, placed one of these Colonies on the banke of the riuer <HI>Rhenus,</HI> neere to the ruines of an auncient Citie, called <HI>Vbiopolis,</HI> erected by the <HI>Vbij,</HI> a nation inhabi∣ting <NOTE PLACE="marg">Colen reedifi∣ed, and so na∣med by the Romaines.</NOTE> those territories long before our Sauiours nati∣uitie. Whence it came to passe, that the antique name
<PB REF="8"/>
of that Citie being quite forgotten and extinguished, it was by reason of the Colonie therein, remaining e∣uer after called <HI>Colonia.</HI> In processe of time, about the yeare from the first creation of the world 4028. <HI>Agrip∣pa</HI> the sonne in law of <HI>Augustus,</HI> being by the Romains sent to gouerne those countries, augmented, reedified and fortified the same, adding to the former name thereof <HI>Agrippina.</HI></P>
<P>The inhabitants of this Citie were first conuerted <NOTE PLACE="marg">The cōuersion of Colen vnto Christian reli∣gion.</NOTE> vnto Christian religion by <HI>S. Materne,</HI> the disciple of <HI>S. Peter.</HI> After whose time although <HI>Theology</HI> was in <HI>Colen</HI> continually professed (as writeth <HI>Wolphelme</HI> Ab∣bot of <HI>Bruuiller)</HI> yet was it taught rather in cloysters &amp; monasteries, then in any publike schoole or place au∣thorized for the same. The Vniuersitie was institu∣ted <NOTE PLACE="marg">The first ere∣ction of the Vniuersitie.</NOTE> by Pope <HI>Vrbane</HI> the sixt, at the instance of the se∣nate and people of <HI>Colen,</HI> in the yeare of our Sauiours incarnation 1388. This Bishop for the great loue and singular affection hee did beare to this flourishing commonwealth, &amp; ancient Colonie of the Romains, did not onely giue them full power and authoritie to conferre all degrees of scholasticall honour to the stu∣dentes therein, but also confirmed vnto them by a publique charter the priuiledges of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>This Academie consisteth now of foure parts of fa∣culties, that is to say, Diuinitie, Law, Phisicke &amp; Phi∣losophie. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The vn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uersity in Colen con∣sisteth of foure parts.</NOTE> Vnder Philosophie are contained the Ma∣thematikes, Poettie and profession of Languages.

at the Minorites: on the vigile of <HI>S. Thomas</HI> the Apostle at the Augustine Fryers.</P>
<P>The office of this Rector is to assemble together the whole congregation of students, &amp; to propound <NOTE PLACE="marg">The office of the Rector or president of the Academy.</NOTE> such thinges as are amongst them in the conuocation to be considered of by the common councell &amp; con∣sent of all the graduates to establish and ratifie decrees, to execute law and iustice, to maintaine their priui∣ledges, and his Rectorship expired, by some publike testimonie of his learning to adorne the Vniuersity.</P>
<P>Beside many excellent places of exercise for Diui∣nitie, Law, &amp; Phisicke; there are three publike schools, wherein Humanitie and Philosophie, with the other <NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Colledges for students in Colen.</P>

<P>There is no citie in <HI>Italie,</HI> which for beautie and statelinesse of edifices, may with this place worthily <NOTE PLACE="marg">Antenor the first founder of Padua.</NOTE> be paragoned. And although it be most true, that <HI>An∣tenor</HI> after his flight from <HI>Troy,</HI> first erected this citie, yet are all her buildinges both publike &amp; priuate new, and of no long continuance.

artes. In this Vniuersity are many goodly colledges deputed onely for the vse of such studentes, as are of poore and meane abilitie.</P>
<P>Three principall causes are alleadged, why this A∣cademie <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three causes why Padua hath so long flourished.</NOTE> adorned with so many priuiledges and pre∣rogatiues hath obtained so great splendor and celebri∣tie. The first is the opportune, sweet and fruitfull situ∣ation of the place, which ministreth to the studentes <NOTE PLACE="marg">The 1. cause.</NOTE> great aboundance of all things necessarie. <HI>Constantinus Paleologus</HI> (as writeth <HI>Rhodogine)</HI> was wont to say, that were it not for the testimonie of the holy and learned fathers, which affirme, that Paradise was in the East: he verilie would belieue it no where could be found, but in the amene and fruitfull fieldes of <HI>Padua.</HI> The bread of that countrey is more pure and white then in any other place of <HI>Italie,</HI> and the wine <HI>Plinie</HI> estee∣meth to be of the best and noblest sort.</P>
<P>The second cause why it hath so long flourished, is <NOTE PLACE="marg">The 2. cause.</NOTE> because it alwaies hath beene found faithfull, firme &amp; constant to the commonwealth of <HI>Rome,</HI> and euen in their greatest calamities, and most pernurious warres hath assisted them with men, money, and muuition: wherefore the <HI>Romaines</HI> a people euer thankful to their friends, &amp; of singular faith &amp; constancie to their con∣federates, omitted nothing that might serue to further &amp; promote the glorie &amp; emolument of the Paduans.</P>
<P>Finally, the third and last cause of the preseruati∣on of their happie estate, is because the Paduans be∣yond <NOTE PLACE="marg">The 3. cause.</NOTE> all other haue euer beene full of humanitie and curtesie, whereby they did often winne the heartes of all men, and moued great Princes and Potentates to
<PB REF="39"/>
fauour them, and become their benefactors. Chastity was of them euer held in so great esteeme, that it grew into a prouerbe, As chaste as one of <HI>Padua:</HI> whereun∣to <HI>Martiall</HI> in these verses alludeth.</P>

<P>Many learned professors and teachers haue labou∣red in this fruitfull vineyard. The first that reuealed vnto this people the arcane and secrete misteries of Christian religion, was <HI>Prosdocimus</HI> the disciple of S. <HI>Paule.</HI> After him was Saint <HI>Anthonie</HI> of <HI>Padua.</HI> Also <NOTE PLACE="marg">The conuersi∣on of the Pa∣duans to Chri∣stianisme.</NOTE> <HI>Caietanus</HI> a learned Diuine, a profound Philosopher &amp; most excellent Phisition, long flourished in this vni∣uersitie. <HI>Thomas Penketh</HI> an Englishman, for his admi∣red learning and eloquence, was with much follicita∣tion and entreatie called out of <HI>Oxford,</HI> to gouerne and direct in <HI>Padua</HI> their scholasticall discipline. <HI>Sabellicus</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thomas Pen∣keth an En∣glishman sent for to Padua.</NOTE> writeth, how the students of <HI>Padua</HI> vnderstanding that <HI>Iohn Campegius</HI> (a personage for his grauity and great learning much in those dayes admired and esteemed) was in person approched neere their towne, the <HI>Re∣ctor,</HI> Rulers and Maysters of the Vniuersitie, toge∣ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">The honour that was wont by the Padu∣ans to be gi∣uen to learned men.</NOTE> with the Magistrate of the Citie, with pompe went out to meete him on the way (which thing they onely are accustomed to do to high &amp; mightie Prin∣ces) &amp; going on foot before him, they conducted him into their towne. Whereby of all men easily may bee perceiued, the dignitie, honour, &amp; respect, they beare vnto worthy professors of learned sciences.

<P>But sundry other Historiographers there are, which (imagining this antiquitie to be somewhat too far fet∣ched) affirme, that the vniuersitie of <HI>Cambridge</HI> was long since erected in the time of <HI>Sigebert</HI> king of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> sixe hundred and thirtie yeares after our Sauiors incarnation.

<P>Whensoeuer this cittie first was founded, or by whom soeuer the vniuersitie was first erected (which matter I will referre to the discussion of more learned antiquaries, since mine intent is onely to set downe such schooles &amp; colledges, as the same at this day doth containe) most certainely true it is, for the antiquitie and worthinesse thereof, it may at this time worthily contend with the most ancient &amp; flourishing vniuer∣sities of the world.</P>
