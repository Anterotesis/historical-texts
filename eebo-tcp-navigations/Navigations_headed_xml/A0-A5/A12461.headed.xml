<HEAD>TO THE ILLVSTRIOVS AND MOST NOBLE PRINCESSE, the Lady FRAN∣CIS, Duchesse of RICHMOND and LENOX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Ay it please your <HI>Grace,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>This History, as for the raritie and varietie of the subiect, so much more for the judicious <HI>Eyes</HI> it is like to vnder∣goe, and most of all for that great <HI>Name,</HI> whereof it dareth implore Protection, might and ought to haue beene clad in better robes then my rude military hand can cut out in Paper Ornaments. But be∣cause, of the most things therein, I am no Compiler by hear∣say, but haue beene a reall Actor; I take my selfe to haue a propertie in them: and therefore haue beene bold to chal∣lenge them to come vnder the reach of my owne rough Pen. That, which hath beene indured and passed through with hardship and danger, is thereby sweetned to the <HI>Actor,</HI> when he becometh the <HI>Relator.</HI> I haue deeply hazarded my selfe in doing and suffering, and why should I sticke to hazard my reputation in Recording? He that acteth two parts is the more borne withall if he come short, or fayle in one of them. Where shall we looke to finde a <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> whose at∣chieuments shine as cleare in his owne Commentaries, as they did in the field? I confesse, my hand, though able to weild a weapon among the Barbarous, yet well may trem∣ble
<PB REF="4"/>
in handling a Pen among so many <HI>Indicious</HI>: especially when I am so bold as to call so piercing, and so glorious an <HI>Eye,</HI> as your <HI>Grace,</HI> to view these poore ragged lines</P>
<P>Yet my comfort is, that heretofore honorable and vertu∣ous <HI>Ladies,</HI> and comparable but amongst themselues, haue of∣fred me rescue and protection in my greatest dangers: even in forraine parts, I haue felt reliefe from that sex. The beaute∣ous Lady <HI>Tragabigzanda,</HI> when I was a slaue to the <HI>Turkes,</HI> did all she could to secure me. When I overcame the <HI>Bashaw</HI> of <HI>Nalbrits</HI> in <HI>Tartaria,</HI> the charitable Lady <HI>Call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mata</HI> supplyed my necessities. In the vtmost of many extremities, that blessed <HI>Pokahontas,</HI> the great Kings daughter of <HI>Virginia,</HI> oft saved my life. When I escaped the crueltie of Pirats and most furious stormes, a long time alone in a small Boat at Sea, and driven ashore in <HI>France,</HI> the good Lady <HI>Madam Chanoyes,</HI> bountifully assisted me.</P>
<P>And so verily these my adventures haue tasted the same <HI>influence</HI> from your <HI>Gratious hand,</HI> which hath given birth to the publication of this <HI>Narration.</HI> If therefore your <HI>Grace</HI> shall daigne to cast your eye on this poore Booke, view I pray you rather your owne <HI>Bountie</HI> (without which it had dyed in the wombe) then my <HI>imperfections,</HI> which haue no helpe but the shrine of your <HI>glorious Name</HI> to be sheltered from cen∣sorious condemnation. Vouchsafe some glimpse of your ho∣norable <HI>aspect,</HI> to accept these my labours; to protect them vnder the shadow of your excellent <HI>Name</HI>: which will ina∣ble them to be presented to the <HI>Kings royall Maiestie,</HI> the most admired Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> and the <HI>Queene</HI> of <HI>Bohemia</HI>: your sweet Recommendations will make it the worthier of their good countenances. And as all my endevours are their due tribute: so this Page shall record to posteritie, that my service shall be to pray to <HI>God,</HI> that you may still continue the renowned of your sexe, the most honored of men, and the highly blessed of <HI>God.</HI></P>

<HEAD>¶ A Preface of foure Poynts.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="I"/><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His plaine History humbly sheweth the truth; that our most royall King <HI>Iames</HI> hath place and opportu∣nitie to inlarge his ancient <HI>Dominions</HI> without wronging any; (which is a condition most agreeable to his most iust &amp; pious resolutions:) and the Prince his <HI>Highness</HI> may see where to plant new Colonies. The gaining Prouinces addeth to the Kings Crown: but the reducing Heathen people to ciuilitie and true Religion, bringeth honour to the King of Hea∣uen. If his Princely wisedome and powerfull hand, renowned through the world for admirable government, please but to set these now Estates into order; their composure will be singular: the counsell of divers is confused; the generall Stocke is consumed; nothing but the touch of the Kings sacred hand can erect a Monarchy.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="II"/> Most noble Lords and worthy Gentlemen, it is your <HI>Honors</HI> that haue imployed great paines and large expence in laying the foundation of this State, wherein much hath beene buried vnder ground, yet some thing hath sprung vp, and gi∣uen you a taste of your adventures. Let no difficulties alter your noble intenti∣ons. The action is an honour to your Country: and the issue may well reimburse you your summes expended. Our practices haue hitherto beene but assayes, and are still to be amended. Let your bountie supply the necessities of weake begin∣nings, and your excellent iudgements rectifie the proceedings; the returne can∣not choose in the end but bring you good Commodities, and good contentments, by your aduancing shipping and fishing so vsefull vnto our Nation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="III"/> Yee valiant and generous spirits, personall possessors of these new-found Ter∣ritories, banish from among you Cowardise, covetousnes, iealousies, and idlenes, enemies to the raising your honours and fortunes; vertue, industry, and amitie, will make you good and great, and your merits liue to ensuing Ages. You that in contempt of necessities, hazard your liues and estates, imploying your studies &amp; labours in these faire endevours, liue and prosper as I desire my soule should prosper.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="IIII"/> For my selfe let emulation and enuie cease, I ever intended my actions should be vpright: now my care hath beene that my Relations should giue every man they concerne, their due. But had I not discovered and liued in the most of those parts, I could not possibly haue collected the substantiall truth from such a num∣ber of variable Relations, that would haue made a Volume at least of a thousand sheets. Though the beginning may seeme harsh in regard of the Antiquities, breuitie, and names; a pleasanter Discourse ensues. The stile of a Souldier is not eloquent, but honest and iustifiable; so I desire all my friends and well-wishers to excuse and accept it, and if any be so noble as to respect it, he that brought <HI>New England</HI> to light, though long since brought in obscuritie, he is againe to be found a true servant to all good designes.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>So I ever rest yours to command, IOHN SMITH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P><MILESTONE N="1170"/> The Chronicles of <HI>Wales</HI> report, that <HI>Madock,</HI> sonne to <HI>Owen Quineth,</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> seeing his two brethren at debate who should inherit, prepared certaine Ships, with men and munition, and left his Country to seeke aduentures by Sea: leauing <HI>Ireland</HI> North he sayled west till he came to a Land vnknowne. Returning home and re∣lating what pleasant and fruitfull Countries he had seene without Inhabitants, and for what barren ground his brethren and kindred did murther one another, he provided a number of Ships, and got with him such men and women as were desirous to liue in quietnesse, that arriued with him in this new Land in the yeare 1170: Left many of his people there and returned for more. But where this place was no History can show.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1492"/> The <HI>Spanyards</HI> say <HI>Hanno</HI> a Prince of <HI>Carthage</HI> was the first: and the next <HI>Chri∣stopher Cullumbus,</HI> a Genoesian, whom they sent to discover those vnknowne parts. 1492.</P>
<P>But we finde by Records, <HI>Cullumbus</HI> offered his seruice in the yeare 1488. to King <HI>Henry</HI> the seauenth; and by accident vndertooke it for the <HI>Spanyards.</HI> In the Interim King <HI>Henry</HI> gaue a Commission to <HI>Iohn Cabot,</HI> and his three sonnes, <HI>Se∣bastian, Lewis,</HI> and <HI>Sautius. Iohn</HI> and <HI>Sebastian</HI> well provided, setting sayle, ranged a great part of this vnknowne world, in the yeare 1497. <MILESTONE N="1497"/> For though <HI>Cullumbus</HI> had found certaine Iles, it was 1498. ere he saw the Continent, which was a yeare after <HI>Cabot.</HI> Now <HI>Americus</HI> came a long time after, though the whole Continent to this day is called <HI>America</HI> after his name, yet <HI>Sebastian Cabot</HI> discovered much more then them all, for he sayled to about forty degrees Southward of the lyne, and to sixty-seauen towards the North: for which King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight Knighted him and made him grand Pilate of <HI>England.</HI> Being very aged King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixt gaue him a Pention of 166<SUP>l</SUP>.13<SUP>•</SUP>.4<SUP>d</SUP>. yearely.

maintaine possession in some of those vast Countries within the tearme of sixe yeares. Yet when he was provided with a Navy able to incounter a Kings power, even here at home they fell in diuisions, and so into confusion, that they gaue o∣ver the Designe ere it was begun, notwithstanding all this losse, his vndanted spi∣rit began againe, but his Fleet fell with <HI>New-found land,</HI> and he perished in his re∣turne, as at large you may read in the third Volume of the English Voyages, writ∣ten by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hackluit.</HI></P>
<P>Vpon all those Relations and inducements, Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> a noble Gen∣tleman, and then in great esteeme, vndertooke to send to discover to the South∣ward. And though his occasions and other imployments were such he could not goe himselfe, yet he procured her Maiesties Letters Pattents, and perswaded many worthy Knights and Gentlemen to adventure with him to finde a place fit for a Plantation. Their Proceedings followeth.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1584"/> The most famous, renowned, and euer worthy of all memory, for her courage, learning, iudgement, and vertue, Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> granted her Letters Patents to Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> for the discovering and planting new Lands &amp; Countries, not actually possessed by any Christians. This Patenty got to be his assistants Sir <HI>Richard Grenvell</HI> the valiant, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Sanderson</HI> a great friend to all such noble and worthy actions, and divers other Gentlemen and Marchants, who with all speede prouided two small Barkes well furnished with all necessaries, vnder the command of Captaine <HI>Philip Amidas</HI> and Captaine <HI>Barlow.</HI> The 27. of Aprill they set sayle from the Thames, the tenth of May passed the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and the tenth of Iune the West Indies: which vnneedfull Southerly course, (but then no better was knowne) occasioned them in that season much sicknesse.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their arrivall.</NOTE>The second of Iuly they fell with the coast of <HI>Florida</HI> in shoule water, where they felt a most dilicate sweete smell, though they saw no land, which ere long they espied, thinking it the Continent: an hundred and twenty myles they sayled not finding any harbor. The first that appeared, with much difficulty they entred, and anchored, and after thankes to God they went to view the next Land adioy∣ning to take possession of it for the Queenes most excellent Maiestie: which done, they found their first landing place very sandy and low,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pundance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apes.</NOTE> but so full of grapes that the very surge of the Sea sometimes over-flowed them: of which they found such plenty in all places, both on the sand, the greene soyle and hils, as in the plaines as well on euery little shrub, as also climbing towardes the tops of high Cedars, that they did thinke in the world were not the like abundance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ile of <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kokon.</HI></NOTE>We passed by the Sea-side towards the tops of the next hills being not high: from whence we might see the Sea on both sides, and found it an Ile of twentie myles in length, and six in breadth, the vallyes replenished with goodly tall Ce∣dars. Discharging our Muskets, such a flocke of Cranes, the most white, arose by vs, with such a cry as if an Army of men had shouted altogether. This Ile hath many goodly Woods, and Decre, Conies, and Foule in incredible abundance, and vsing the Authors owne phrase, the Woods are not such as you finde in <HI>Bo∣hemia, Moscovia,</HI> or <HI>Hercinia,</HI> barren and fruitlesse, but the highest and reddest Ce∣dars of the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>Lybanus</HI> are not many.</NOTE> bettering them of the Assores, Indies, or <HI>Libanus</HI>: Pynes, Cy∣pres, Saxefras, the Lentisk that beareth Mastick, and many other of excellent smell and qualitie. Till the third day we saw not any of the people, then in a little Boat three of them appeared, one of them went on shore, to whom wee rowed, and he attended vs without any signe of feare; after he had spoke much though we vn∣derstood not a word, of his owne accord he came boldly aboord vs, we gaue him a shirt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference with a Sal∣vage.</NOTE> a hat, wine and meate, which he liked well, and after he had well viewed the barkes and vs, he went away in his owne Boat, and within a quarter of a myle of vs in halfe an houre, had loaden his Boat with fish, with which he came againe to the poynt of land, and there devided it in two parts, poynting one part to the Ship, the other to the Pinnace, and so departed.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10" MS="y"/>The next d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y came diuers Boats, and in one of them the Kings Brother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arriuall of the Kings brother.</NOTE> with forty or fifty men, proper people, and their behauiour very ciuill; his name was <HI>Granganame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the King is called <HI>Wingina,</HI> the Country <HI>Wingandacoa.</HI> Leauing his Boats a little from our Ships, he came with his trayne to the poynt: where sprea∣ding a Matte he sat downe. Though we came to him well armed, he made signes to vs to sit downe without any shew of feare, stroking his head and brest, and also ours, to expresse his loue. After he had made a long speech vnto vs, we presented him with diuers toyes, which he kindly accepted. He was greatly regarded by his people, for none of them did sit, nor speake a word, but foure, on whom we be∣stowed presents also, but he tooke all from them, making signes all things did belong to him.</P>
<P>The King himselfe in a conflict with a King his next neighbour and mortall enemy, was shot in two places through the body, and the thigh, yet recouered: whereby he lay at his chiefe towne six dayes iourney from thence.</P>
<P>A day or two after shewing them what we had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade with the Salvages.</NOTE> <HI>Granganamco</HI> taking most li∣king to a Pewter dish, made a hole in it, hung it about his necke for a brest-plate: for which he gaue vs twenty Deere skins, worth twenty Crownes; and for a Cop∣per Kettell, fiftie skins, worth fiftie Crownes. Much other trucke we had, and af∣ter two dayes he came aboord, and did eate and drinke with vs very merrily. Not long after he brought his wife and children, they were but of meane stature, but well fauoured and very bashfull; she had a long coat of Leather, and about her privities a peece of the same, about her forehead a band of white Corrall, and so had her husband, in her eares were bracelets of pearle, hanging downe to her middle, or the bignesse of great Pease; the rest of the women had Pendants of Copper, and the Noblemen fiue or sixe in an eare; his apparrell as his wiues, one∣ly the women weare their haire long on both sides, and the men but on one; they are of colour yellow, but their hayre is blacke, yet we saw children that had very fayre Chesnut coloured hayre.</P>
<P>After that these women had beene here with vs, there came downe from all parts great store of people, with Leather, Corrall, and diuers kinde of dyes, but when <HI>Granganameo</HI> was present, none durst trade but himselfe, and them that wore red Copper on their heads, as he did. When euer he came, he would signifie by so many fires he came with so many boats, that we might know his strength. Their Boats are but one great tree, which is but burnt in the forme of a trough with gins and fire, till it be as they would haue it. For an armour he would haue inga∣ged vs a bagge of pearle, but we refused, as not regarding it, that wee might the better learn where it grew. He was very iust of his promise, for oft we trusted him, and he would come within his day to keepe his word. He sent vs commonly eue∣ry day a brace of Bucks, Conies, Hares, and fish, sometimes Mellons, Walnuts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI></NOTE> Cucumbers. Pease, and diuers rootes. This Author sayth, their corne groweth three times in fiue moneths; in May they sow, in Iuly reape; in Iune they sow, in August reape; in Iuly sow, in August reape.

Af∣ter this acquaintance, my selfe with seauen more went twenty myle into the Ri∣uer <HI>Occam,</HI> that runneth toward the Cittie <HI>Skicoack,</HI> and the euening following we came to an Ile called <HI>Roanoak,</HI> from the harbour where we entred 7. leagues;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ile <HI>Roa∣noak.</HI></NOTE> at the North end was 9. houses, builded with Cedar, fortified round with sharpe trees, and the entrance like a Turnpik. When we came towards it, the wife of <HI>Gran∣ganameo</HI> came running out to meete vs, (her husband was absent) commanding her people to draw our Boat ashore for beating on the billowes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great courtesie of a Woman.</NOTE> other she appoyn∣ted to carry vs on their backes a land, others to bring our Ores into the house for

When we came into the other roome, (for there was fiue in the house) she caused vs to sit downe by a great fire; after tooke off our clothes and washed them, of some our stockings, and some our feete in warme water, and she her selfe tooke much paines to see all things well ordered, and to provide vs victuall.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A banquet.</NOTE>After we had thus dryed our selues, she brought vs into an Inner roome, where she set on the bord standing a long the house somewhat like frumentie, sodden venison, and rosted fish; in like manner mellons raw, boyled rootes and fruites of diuers kindes. There drinke is commonly water boyled with Ginger, sometimes with Saxefras, and wholsome herbes, but whilest the Crape lasteth they drinke wine. More loue she could not expresse to entertaine vs; they care but onely to defend themselues from the short winter, and feede on what they finde naturall in sommer. In this fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting house was their Idoll of whom they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould vs vn∣credible things. When we were at meate two or three of her men came amongst vs with their Bowes and Arrowes, which caused vs to take our armes in hand. She perceiuing our distrust, caused their Bowes and Arrowes to be broken, and they be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten out of the gate: but the euening approaching we returned to our boate, where at she much grieuing brought our supper halfe boyled, pots and all, but when she saw vs, but put our boat a little off from the shoar and lye at Anchor, perceiuing our Ielousie, she sent diuers men &amp; 30. women to sit al night on the shoare side against vs, and sent vs fiue Mats to couer vs from the raine, doing all she could to perswade vs to her house. Though there was no cause of doubt, we would not aduenture: for on our safety depended the voyage: but a more kinde louing people cannot be.

<P>Touching the most remarkeable things of the Country and our proceeding from the 17 of <HI>August</HI> 1585. till the 18. of <HI>Iune</HI> 1586.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their first Plantation.</NOTE> we made <HI>Roanoack</HI> our habitation. The vtmost of our discouery Southward was <HI>Secotan</HI> as we esteemed 80. leagues from <HI>Roanoacke.</HI> The passage from thence was thought a broad sound within the maine, being without kenning of land, yet full of flats and shoulds that our Pinnasse could not passe, &amp; we had but one boat with 4. ores, that would carry but 15. men with their prouisions for 7. dayes: so that because the winter approached we left those discoueries till a stronger supply. To the Northward; our farthest was to a Towne of the <HI>Chesapeacks,</HI> from <HI>Roanoack</HI> 130. myles. The passage is very shallow and dangerous by reason of the breadth of the sound and the little succour for a storme, but this teritory being 15. myle from the shoare, for pleasantnest of seate, for temporature of climate, fertility of soyle and como∣ditie of the Sea, besides beares, good woods, <HI>Saxefras, Walnuts &amp;c.</HI> is not to be, excelled by any other whatsoeuer.</P>

<P>The townes by the way by the water, are <HI>Passaquenock</HI> the womens towne, <HI>Che∣panoe, Weapomciok</HI>; from <HI>Muscamunge</HI> wee enter the riuer and iurisdiction of <HI>Chawonock,</HI> there it beginneth to straiten, and at <HI>Chawonock</HI> it is as <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Lam∣beth</HI>: betwixt them as we passed is goodly high land on the left hand, and there is a towne called <HI>Ohanock,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chawonock</HI> 700. men.</NOTE> where is a great corne field, it is subiect to <HI>Chawonock,</HI> which is the greatest Prouince vpon the riuer, and the Towne it selfe can put se∣uen hundred men into the field, besides the forces of the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. The King is lame, but hath more vnderstanding then all the rest.</P>
<P>The river of <HI>Moratoc</HI> is more famous then all the rest, and openeth into the sound of <HI>Weapometok,</HI> and where there is but a very small currant in <HI>Chawonock,</HI> it hath so strong a currant from the Southwest, as we doubted how to row against it. Strange things they report of the head of this riuer, and of <HI>Moratoc</HI> it selfe, a principall towne on it, &amp; is thirtie or fortie dayes Iourney to the head. This lame King is called <HI>Menatonon.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Menatonon</HI> his Relations of the Ile of Pearle, and a rich Mine, &amp; the Sea by it.</NOTE> When I had him prisoner two dayes, he told mee that 3. d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes Iourney in a Canow vp the riuer <HI>Chawonock,</HI> then landing &amp; going foure dayes Iourney Northeast, there is a King whose Country lyeth on the Sea, but his best place of strength is an Iland in a Bay inuironed with deepe water, where he taketh that abundance of Pearle, that not onely his skins, and his nobles, but also his beds and houses are garnished therewith. This king was at <HI>Chawonock</HI> two yeares agoe to trade with blacke pearle, his worst sort whereof I had a rope, but they were naught; but that King he sayth hath store of white, and had trafficke with white men, for whom he reserued them; he promised me guides to him, but aduised me to goe strong, for he was vnwilling strangers should come in his Country, for his Country is populous and valiant men. If a supply had come in Aprill, I resolued to haue sent a small Barke to the Northward to haue found it, whilest I with small Boates and 200. men would haue gone to the head of the riuer <HI>Chawonock,</HI> with sufficient guides by land, inskonsing my selfe euery two dayes, where I would leaue Garrisons for my retreat till I came to this Bay.</P>
<P>Very neare vnto it is the riuer of <HI>Moratoc,</HI> directly from the West, the head of it springeth out of a mayne Rocke, which standeth so neare the Sea, that in stormes the Sea beats ouer it into this fresh spring, that of it selfe at the surse is a violent streame. I intended with two Wherries and fortie persons to haue <HI>Menatonons</HI> sonne for guide, to try this presently, till I could meete with some of the <HI>Mora∣tocks,</HI> or <HI>Mangoaks,</HI> but hoping of getting more victuall from the Saluages, we as narrowly escaped staruing in that Discouery as euer men did.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pemissapan</HI> his trechery.</NOTE>For <HI>Pemissapan</HI> who had changed his name of <HI>Wingina</HI> vpon the death of his brother <HI>Granganameo,</HI> had giuen both the <HI>Chawonests,</HI> and <HI>Mangoaks</HI> word of my purpose: also he told me the <HI>Chawonocks</HI> had assembled two or three thousand to assault me at <HI>Roanok,</HI> vrging me daily to goe against them, and them against vs; a great assembly I found at my comming thether, which suddaine approach did so dismay them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The discoue∣ry of the riuer <HI>Morat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c.</HI></NOTE> that we had the better of them: &amp; this confederacy against vs was procured by <HI>Pemissapan</HI> himselfe our chiefe friend we trusted; he sent word also to the <HI>Moratoks</HI> and the <HI>Mangoaks,</HI> I came to inuade them, that they all fled vp into the high Country, so that where I assured my selfe both of succour and pro∣uision, I found all abandoned. But being thus farre on my iourney 160. myles from home, and but victuals for two dayes, besides the casualties of crosse winds, stormes, and the Saluages trechery, though we intended no hurt to any: I gaue my Company to vnderstand we were onely drawne forth vpon these vaine hopes by the Saluages to bring vs to confusion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A noble re∣solution.</NOTE> a Councell we held, to goe forward or returne, but they all were absolutely resolued but three, that whilst there was but one pynt of Corne for a man, they would not leaue the search of that riuer; for they had two Mastiue Dogs, which boyled with Saxefras leaues (if the worst fell
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
out) vpon them and the pottage they would liue two dayes, which would bring them to the sound, where they should finde fish-for two dayes more to passe it to <HI>Roanock,</HI> which two dayes they had rather fast then goe backe a foote, till they had seene the <HI>Mangoaks</HI> either as friends or foes.</P>
<P>Though I did forsee the danger and misery, yet the desire I had to see the <HI>Man∣goaks</HI> was, for that there is a prouince called <HI>Chaunis Temoatan,</HI> frequented by them and well
knowne to all those Countries, where is a mine of Copper they call <HI>Wassador</HI>; they say they take it out of a riuer that falleth swiftly from high rocks in shallow water, in great Bowles, couered with leather, leauing a part open to re∣ceiue the mettall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The strange Mine of <HI>Chau∣nis Temoatan.</HI></NOTE> which by the change of the colour of the water where the spout falleth, they suddainly chop downe, and haue the Bowlefull, which they cast in∣to the fire, it presently melteth, and doth yeeld in fiue parts at the first melting two parts mettall for three of Ore. The <HI>Mangoaks</HI> haue such plenty of it, they beau∣tifie their houses with great plates thereof: this the Salvages report; and young <HI>Skiko</HI> the King of <HI>Chawonocks</HI> sonne my prisoner, that had beene prisoner among the <HI>Mangoak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> but neuer at <HI>Chaunis Temoatan,</HI> for he sayd that was twentie dayes iourney ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the <HI>Mangoaks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Menatonon</HI> also confirmed all this, and promised me guids to this mettall Coun∣try; by Land to the <HI>Mangoaks</HI> is but one dayes iourney, but seauen by water, which made me so willing to haue met them for some assay of this mettall: but when we came there we found no creature, onely we might see where had beene their fires. After our two dayes iourney, and our victuals spent, in the euening we heard some call as we thought <HI>Manteo,</HI> who was with me in the boat; this made vs glad, he made them a friendly answer, which they answered with a song we thought for welcome, but he told vs they came to fight. Presently they did let flie their Arrowes about the boat, but did no hurt, the other boat scouring the shore we landed: but they all were fled, and how to finde them wee knew not.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great currant of the river <HI>Morat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></NOTE> So the next morning we returned to the mouth of the riuer, that cost vs foure dayes rowing vp, and here our dogs pottage stood vs in good stead, for we had nothing els: the next day we fasted being windbound, and could not passe the sound, but the day following we came to <HI>Chippanum,</HI> where the people were fled, but their wires afforded vs fish: thus being neare spent, the next day God brought vs to <HI>Roanocke.</HI> I conclude a good Mine, or the South sea will make this Country quickly inhabited, and so for pleasure and profit comparable with any in the world: otherwise there will be nothing worth the fetching. Provided there be found a better harbour then yet there is, which must be Northward if there be a∣ny. Master <HI>Vaughan,</HI> no lesse hoped of the goodnesse of the Mine, then Master <HI>Heriot</HI> that the riuer <HI>Moratocks</HI> head, either riseth by the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or very neare the South Sea, or some part that openeth neare the same, which cannot with that facilitie be done as from the Bay of Pearles, by insconsing foure dayes iour∣ney to the <HI>Chawonoks, Mangoaks,</HI> and <HI>Moratocks,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P><HI>ENsenore</HI> a Saluage, father to <HI>Pemissapan,</HI> the best friend we had after the death of <HI>Granganimeo,</HI> when I was in those Discoueries, could not prevaile any thing with the King from destroying vs, that all this time God had preser∣ued, by his good counsell to the King to be friendly vnto vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conspi∣racy of <HI>Pe∣missapan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Pemissapan</HI> thinking as the brute was in this last iourney we were slaine and starued, began to blaspheme our God that would suffer it, and not defend vs, so that old <HI>Ensenore</HI> had no more credit for vs: for he began by all the deuises he could to inuade vs. But in the beginning of this brute, when they saw vs all returne, the report false,

and had <HI>Manteo,</HI> and three Saluages more with vs, how little we esteemed all the people we met, and feared neither hunger, killing, or any thing, and had brought their greatest Kings sonne prisoner with vs to <HI>Roanock</HI>: it a little asswaged all his deuises, and brought <HI>Ensenore</HI> in respect againe, that our God was good, and wee their friends, and our foes should perish, for we could do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them more hurt being dead, then liuing, and that being an hundred myles from them, shot, and strucke them sicke to death, and that when we die it is but for a time, then we returne a∣gaine. But that which wrought the most feare among them was the handy-worke of Almightie God. For certaine dayes after my returne, <HI>Menatonon</HI> sent messen∣gers to me with Pearle, and <HI>Okisco</HI> King of <HI>Weopomcoke,</HI> to yeeld himselfe seruant to the Queene of <HI>England. Okisco</HI> with twenty-foure of his principall men came to <HI>Pemissapan</HI> to acknowledge this dutie and subiection, and would performe it. All which so changed the heart of <HI>Pemissapan,</HI> that vpon the aduise of <HI>Ensenore,</HI> when we were ready to famish they came and made vs wires, and planted their fields they intended to abandon (we not hauing one corne till the next haruest to sustaine vs).<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of a most rare Salvage.</NOTE> This being done our old friend <HI>Ensenore</HI> dyed the twenty of A∣prill, then all our enemies wrought with <HI>Pemissapan</HI> to put in practise his deuises, which he easily imbraced, though they had planted corne by vs, and at <HI>Dasamon∣peack</HI> two leagues from vs. Yet they got <HI>Okisco</HI> our tributary to get seuen or eight hundred (and the <HI>Mandoages</HI> with the <HI>Chisapeans</HI> should doe the like) to meete (as their custome is) to solemnize the Funerall of <HI>Ensenore.</HI> Halfe of whom should lye hid, to cut off the straglers, seeking crabs and prouision: the rest come out of the mayne vpon the Signall by fire. Twenty of the principall of <HI>Pemissapans</HI> men had charge in the night to beset my house, put fire in the Reeds that couered it, which might cause me run out so naked and amazed, they might without danger knocke out my braines. The same order for M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Heriots,</HI> and the rest: for all should haue beene fired at an instant. In the meane time they should sell vs nothing, and in the night spoyle our wires, to make nenessitie disperse vs. For if we were but ten together, a hundred of them would not meddle with vs. So our famine in∣creased, I was forced to send Captaine <HI>Stafford</HI> to <HI>Croatan,</HI> with twentie to feed himselfe, and see if he could espie any sayle passe the coast; M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Predeox</HI> with ten to <HI>Hatarask</HI> vpon the same occasion: and other small parties to the Mayne to liue vpon rootes and Oysters.</P>
<P><HI>Pemissapan</HI> sequestring himselfe, I should not importune him for victuall, and to draw his troupes, found not the <HI>Chawonests</HI> so forward as he expected, being a people more faithfull and powerfull, and desired our friendships, and was offen∣ded with him for raising such tales, and all his proiects were revealed to me by <HI>Skico</HI> my prisoner; who finding himselfe as well vsed by me, as <HI>Pemissapan</HI> tould me all. These troubles caused me send to <HI>Pemissapan,</HI> to put suspition in his head, I was to goe presently to <HI>Croatan</HI> to meete a Fleete came to me, though I knew no such matter: and that he would lend me m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to fish and hunt. He sent me word he would come himselfe to <HI>Roanock</HI>; but delaying time eight dayes that all his men were there to be assembled, not liking so much company, I resolued the next day to goe visit him, but first to giue them in the Ile a Canvisado, and at an instant to seaze on all their Canows about the Ile. But the towne tooke the Ala∣rum before I ment it. For when I sent to take the Canows, he met one going from the shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A slaughter of two Salvages.</NOTE> ouerthrew her and cut off two Salvages heads; wherevpon the cry a∣rose, being by their spyes perceiued: for they kept as good watch over vs, as we of them. Vpon this they to their Bowes, and we to our Armes: three or foure of them at the first were slaine, the rest fled into the woods. The next morning I went to <HI>Dassamonpeack</HI> and sent <HI>Pemissapan</HI> word I was going to <HI>Croatan,</HI> and tooke him in my way to complaine <HI>Osocon</HI> would haue stole my prisoner <HI>Skico.</HI> Herevpon he did abide my comming, &amp; being among eight of the principall est.

<P>Seauen dayes after Captaine <HI>Stafforton</HI> sent to me he descryed twentie-three Sayle. The next day came to me himselfe (of whom I must say this, from the first to the last, he neither spared labour, or perill by land or sea, fayre weather, or foule, to performe any serious seruice committed to him.) He brought me a letter from Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> whose generous mind offered to supply all my defects, of ship∣ping, boats, munition, victuall, clothes, and men to further this action: and vp∣on good consultation and deliberation, he appointed me a ship of 70. tuns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A most gene∣rous courtesie of <HI>Sir Francis Drake.</HI></NOTE> with an hundred men, and foure moneths victuals, two Pinnaces, foure small Boats, with two sufficient Masters, with sufficient Gangs. All this being made ready for me, suddenly arose such a storme for foure dayes, that had like to haue driuen the whole Fleete on shore: many of them were forced to the Sea, whereof my ship so lately giuen me was one, with all my prouision and Company appoynted.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, the storme ceasing, the Generall appointed me a ship of 170. tuns, with all prouisions as before, to carry me into <HI>England</HI> the next August, or when I had performed such Discoueries as I thought fit. Yet they durst not vndertake to bring her into the harbour, but she must ride in the road, leauing the care of the rest to my selfe, advising me to consider with my Company what was fittest, and with my best speed returne him answer.</P>
<P>Herevpon calling my Company together, who were all as priuy of the Gene∣rals offer as my selfe; their whole request was, (in regard of all those former mi∣series, and no hope of the returne of Sir <HI>Richard Grenvill,</HI>) and with a generall consent, they desired me to vrge him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Virginia</HI> abandoned.</NOTE> we might all goe with him for <HI>England</HI> in his Fleete; for whose reliefe in that storme he had sustained more perill of wrack, then in all his honorable actions against his enemies. So with prayses to God we set sayle in Iune 1586. and arriued in <HI>Portsmouth</HI> the 27. of Iuly the same yeare: Leaving this remembrance to posteritie.</P>

They beleeue there are ma∣ny gods which they call <HI>Mantoac,</HI> but of different sorts and degrees. Also that there is one chiefe God that hath beene from all eternitie, who as they say when he purposed first to make the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the world was made.</NOTE> made first other gods of a principall order, to be as instruments to be vsed in the Creation and government to follow: And after the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, as pettie gods; and the instruments of the other order more principall. First (they say) were made waters, out of which by the gods were made all diversitie of creatures that are visible or invisible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How man was made.</NOTE>For mankinde they say a Woman was made first, which by the working of one of the gods conceiued and brought forth children; and so they had their begin∣ning, but how many yeares or ages since they know not; having no Records but onely Tradition from Father to sonne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they vse their gods.</NOTE>They thinke that all the gods are of humane shape, and therefore represent them by Images in the formes of men; which they call <HI>Kewasowok:</HI> one alone is called <HI>Kewasa</HI>; them they place in their Temples, where they worship, pray, sing, and make many offerings. The common sort thinke them also gods.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether they goe after death.</NOTE>They beleeue the immortalitie of the Soule, when life departing from the bo∣dy, according to the good or bad workes it hath done, it is c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rried vp to the Ta∣bernacles of the gods, to perpetuall happpinesse, or to <HI>Popogusso,</HI> a great pit: which they thinke to be at the furthest parts of the world, where the Sunne sets, and there burne continually.</P>
<P>To confirme this they told me of two men that had beene lately dead, and re∣vived
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
againe; the one hapned but few yeares before our comming into the coun∣try; of a bad man, which being dead and buried, the next day the earth over him being seene to moue, was taken vp, who told them his soule was very neare ente∣ring into <HI>Popogusso,</HI> had not one of the gods saued him and gaue him leaue to re∣turne againe, to teach his friends what they should doe to avoyd such torment. The other hapned the same yeare we were there, but sixtie myles from vs, which they told me for news, that one being dead, buried, &amp; taken vp as the first, shewed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two men ri∣sen from death.</NOTE> that although his body had layne dead in the graue, yet his soule liued, and had travailed far in a long broad way, on both sides whereof grew more sweet, fayre, and delicate trees and fruits, then ever he had seene before; at length he came to most braue and fayre houses, neare which he met his Father, that was dead long agoe, who gaue him charge to goe backe, to shew his friends what good there was to doe, to inioy the pleasures of that place; which when hee had done hee should come againe.</P>
<P>What subtiltie so ever be in the <HI>Weroances,</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI>; this opinion worketh so much in the common sort, that they haue great respect to their Governours:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The subtiltie of their Priests.</NOTE> and as great care to avoyde torment after death, and to enioy blisse. Yet they haue di∣vers sorts of punishments according to the offence, according to the greatnesse of the fact. And this is the sum of their Religion, which I learned by having speci∣all familiaritie with their Priests, wherein they were not so sure grounded, nor gaue such credit, but through conversing with vs, they were brought into great doubts of their owne, and no small admiration of ours: of which many desired to learne more then we had meanes for want of vtterance in their Language to ex∣presse.</P>
<P>Most things they saw with vs as Mathematicall Instruments, Sea Compasses;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their simpli∣citie.</NOTE> the vertue of the Loadstone, Perspectiue Glasses, burning Glasses: Clocks to goe of themselues; Bookes, writing, Guns, and such like; so far exceeded their ca∣pacities, that they thought they were rather the workes of gods then men; or at least the gods had taught vs how to make them, which loued vs so much better then them; &amp; caused many of them giue credit to what wespake concerning our God. In all places where I came, I did my best to make his immortall glory knowne. And I told them, although the Bible I shewed them, contained all; yet of it selfe, it was not of any such vertue as I thought they did conceiue. Notwith∣standing many would be glad to touch it, to kisse, and imbrace it, to hold it to their breasts, and heads, and stroke all their body over with it.</P>
<P>The King <HI>Wingina</HI> where we dwelt, would oft be with vs at Prayer. Twice he was exceeding sicke and like to dye. And doubting of any helpe from his Priests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their desire of salvation.</NOTE> thinking he was in such danger for offending vs and our God, sent for some of vs to pray, and be a meanes to our God, he might liue with him after death. And so did many other in the like case. One other strange Accident (leauing others) will I mention before I end, which mooued the whole Country that either knew or heard of vs, to haue vs in wonderfull admiration.</P>
<P>There was no Towne where they had practised any villany against vs (we lea∣ving it vnpunished, because we sought by all possible meanes to winne them by gentlenes) but within a few dayes after our departure, they began to dye;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonderfull Accident.</NOTE> in some Townes twenty, in some forty, in some sixty, and in one an hundred and twenty, which was very many in respect of their numbers. And this hapned in no place (we could learn) where we had bin, but where they had vsed some practise to be∣tray vs. And this disease was so strange, they neither knew what it was, nor how to cure it; nor had they knowne the like time out of minde; a thing specially ob∣served by vs, as also by themselues, in so much that some of them who were our friends, especially <HI>Wingina,</HI> had observed such effects in foure or fiue Townes, that they were perswaded it was the worke of God through our meanes: and that we by him might kill and slay whom we would, without weapons, and not come
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
neare them. And therevpon, when they had any vnderstanding, that any of their enemies abused vs in our Iourneyes, they would intreat vs, we would be a meanes to our God, that they, as the others that had dealt ill with vs, might dye in like sort: although we shewed them their requests were vngodly; and that our GOD would not subiect himselfe to any such requests of men, but all things as he plea∣sed came to passe: and that we to shew our selues his true servants, ought rather to pray for the contrary: yet because the effect sell out so suddenly after, according to their desires, they thought it came to passe by our meanes, and would come giue vs thankes in their manner, that though we satisfied them not in words, yet in deeds we had fulfilled their desires.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their strange opinions.</NOTE>This marueilous Accident in all the Country wrought so strange opinions of vs, that they could not tell whether to thinke vs gods or men. And the rather that all the space of their sicknesse, there was no man of ours knowne to die, or much sicke. They noted also we had no women, nor cared for any of theirs: some there∣fore thought we were not borne of women, and therefore not mortall, but that we were men of an old generation many yeares past, &amp; risen againe from immor∣talitie. Some would Prophesie there were more of our generation yet to come, to kill theirs and take their places. Those that were to come after vs they imagined to be in the ayre, yet invisible and without bodies: and that they by our intreaties, for loue of vs, did make the people die as they did, by shooting invisible bullets in∣to them.</P>
<P>To confirme this, their Physicians to excuse their Ignorance in curing the dis∣ease, would make the simple people beleeue, that the strings of bloud they suck∣ed out of the sicke bodies, were the strings wherein the invisible bullets were tyed, and cast. Some thought we shot them our selues from the place where we dwelt, and killed the people that had offended vs, as we listed, how farre distant soever. And others said it was the speciall worke of God for our sakes, as we had cause in some sort to thinke no lesse, whatsoever some doe, or may imagine to the contra∣ry; especially some <HI>Astrologers</HI> by the eclipse of the Sunne we saw that yeare be∣fore our Voyage, and by a <HI>Comet</HI> which began to appeare but a few dayes before the sicknesse began: but to exclude them from being the speciall causes of so spe∣ciall an Accident, there are farther reasons then I thinke fit to present or alledge.</P>
<P>These their opinions I haue set downe, that you may see there is hope to imbrace the truth, and honor, obey, feare and loue vs, by good dealing and government: though some of our company towards the latter end, before we came away with Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> shewed themselues too furious, in slaying some of the people in some Townes, vpon causes that on our part might haue bin borne with more mildnesse; notwithstanding they iustly had deserued it. The best neverthelesse in this, as in all actions besides, is to be indevoured and hoped; and of the worst that may happen, notice to be taken with consideration; and as much as may be eschewed; the better to allure them hereafter to Civilitie and Christianitie.</P>

<P>WE went the old course by the west <HI>Indies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Master <HI>White</HI> his Voyages. 1687.</NOTE> and <HI>Simon Ferdinando</HI> our continuall Pilot mistaking <HI>Virginia</HI> for Cape <HI>Fear,</HI> we sayled not much to haue beene cast away, vpon the conceit of our all-knowing <HI>Ferdi∣nando,</HI> had it not beene prevented by the vigilancy of Captaine <HI>Staf∣ford.</HI> We came to <HI>Hatorask</HI> the 22. of Iuly, and with fortie of our best men, in∣tending at <HI>Roanoack</HI> to find the 50 men left by Sir <HI>Richard Grenvill.</HI> But we found nothing but the bones of a man, and where the Plantation had beene, the houses vnhurt, but overgrowne with weeds, and the Fort defaced, which much perplex∣ed vs.</P>
<P>By the History it seemes <HI>Simon Ferdinando</HI> did what he could to bring this voy∣age to confusion; but yet they all arrived at <HI>Hatorask.</HI> They repayred the old hou∣ses at <HI>Roanock,</HI> and Master <HI>George How,</HI> one of the Councell, stragling abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">One of the Councell slaine.</NOTE> was slaine by the Salvages. Not long after Master <HI>Stafford</HI> with 20. men went to <HI>Croa∣tan</HI> with <HI>Manteo,</HI> whose friends dwelled there: of whom we thought to haue some newes of our 50 men. They at first made shew to fight, but when they heard <HI>Manteo,</HI> they threw away their Armes, and were friends, and desired there might be a token giuen to be knowne by, least we might hurt them by mispri∣sion, as the yeare before one had bin by Master <HI>Layne,</HI> that was ever their friend, and there present yet lame.</P>
<P>The next day we had conference with them concerning the people of <HI>Secotan, Aquascogoc,</HI> and <HI>Pomeiok,</HI> willing them of <HI>Croatan</HI> to see if they would accept our friendship, and renew our old acquaintance: which they willingly imbraced, and promised to bring their King and Governours to <HI>Roanoak,</HI> to confirme it. We also vnderstood that Master <HI>Howe</HI> was slaine by the men of <HI>Wingina,</HI> of <HI>Dassa∣monpeack</HI>: and by them of <HI>Roanoack,</HI> that the fiftie men left by Sir <HI>Richard Grenvill,</HI> were suddainly set vpon by three hundred of <HI>Secotan, Aquascogoc,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the fiftie men were slain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and <HI>Dassamon∣peack.</HI> First they intruded themselues among 11 of them by friendship, one they slew, the rest retyring to their houses, they set them on fire, that our men with what came next to hand were forced to make their passage among them; where one of them was shot in the mouth, and presently dyed, and a Salvage slaine by him. On both sides more were hurt; but our men retyring to the water side, got their boat, &amp; ere they had rowed a quarter of a myle towards <HI>Hatorask,</HI> they tooke vp foure of their fellowes, gathering Crabs and Oysters: at last they landed on a little Ile by <HI>Hatorask,</HI> where they remained a while, but after departed they

knew not whether. So taking our leaues of the <HI>Croatans,</HI> we came to our Fleet at <HI>Hatorask.</HI></P>
<P>The Governour having long expected the King and Governours of <HI>Pomeiok, Secotan, Aquascogoc,</HI> and <HI>Dassamonpeack,</HI> and the 7. dayes expired, and no newes of them, being also informed by those of <HI>Croatan,</HI> that they of <HI>Dassamonpeack</HI> slew Master <HI>How,</HI> and were at the driving our men from <HI>Raonoack</HI> he thought no lon∣ger to deferre the revenge. Wherefore about midnight, with Captaine <HI>Stafford,</HI> and twentie-foure men, whereof <HI>Manteo</HI> was one, for our guide, (that behaved himselfe towards vs as a most faithfull English man) he set forward.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An ill mis∣prision.</NOTE>The next day by breake of day we landed, and got beyond their houses, where seeing them sit by the fire we assaulted them. The miserable soules amazed fled into the Reeds, where one was shot through, and we thought to haue beene fully revenged, but we were deceiued, for they were our friends come from <HI>Croatan</HI> to gather their corne, because they vnderstood our enemies were fled after the death of Master <HI>How,</HI> and left all behinde them for the birds. But they had like to haue payd too deare for it, had we not chanced vpon a <HI>Weroances</HI> wife, with a childe at her backe, and a Salvage that knew Captaine <HI>Stafford,</HI> that ran to him calling him by his name. Being thus disappointed of our purpose, we gathered the fruit we found ripe, left the rest vnspoyled, and tooke <HI>Menatonon</HI> his wife with her childe, and the rest with vs to <HI>Roanoak.</HI> Though this mistake grieued <HI>Manteo,</HI> yet he im∣puted it to their own folly, because they had not kept promise to come to the go∣vernor at the day appointed. The 13. of August our Salvage <HI>Manteo</HI> was Christe∣ned, and called Lord of <HI>Dassamonpeack,</HI> in reward of his faithfulnesse.

<P>Our ships being ready to depart, such a storme arose, as the Admirall was forced to cut her Cables: and it was six dayes ere she could recover the shore, that made vs doubt she had beene lost, because the most of her best men were on shore. At this time Controversies did grow betwixt our Governour and the Assistants, a∣bout choosing one of them 12. to goe as Factor for them all to <HI>England</HI>; for all re∣fused saue one, whom all men thought most insufficient: the Conclusion was by a generall consent, they would haue the Governour goe himselfe, for that they thought none would so truly procure there supplyes as he.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A controver∣sie who to send for Fac∣tor to <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></NOTE> Which though he did what he could to excuse it, yet their importunitie would not cease till he vnder∣tooke it, and had it vnder all their hands how vnwilling he was, but that necessity and reason did doubly constraine him. At their setting sayle for <HI>England,</HI> waighing Anchor, twelue of the men in the flyboat were throwne from the Capstern, by the breaking of a barre, and most of them so hurt, that some never recovered it. The second time they had the like fortune, being but 15. they cut the Cable and kept company with their Admirall to <HI>Flowres</HI> and <HI>Coruos</HI>; the Admirall stayed there looking for purchase: but the flyboats men grew so weake they were driuen to <HI>Smerwick</HI> in the West of <HI>Ireland.</HI> The Governour went for <HI>England</HI>; and <HI>Simon Ferdinando</HI> with much adoe at last arrived at <HI>Portsmouth.</HI> 1587.</P>

The 15. we came to <HI>Hatorask</HI> in 36. degrees &amp; a terse, at 4. fadom, 3 leagues from shore: where we might perceiue a smoake at the place where I left the Colony, 1587. The next morning Captaine <HI>Cooke,</HI> Captaine <HI>Spicer,</HI> &amp; their companies, with two boats left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur ships, and discharged some Ordnance to giue them notice of our comming, but when we came there, we found no man, nor signe of any that had beene there lately: and so returned to our Boats. The next morning we prepared againe for <HI>Roanoack.</HI> Captaine <HI>Spicer</HI> had then sent his Boat ashore for water, so it was ten of the Clocke ere we put from the ships, which rode two myles from the shore. The Admirals boat, being a myle before the other, as she passed the bar, a sea broke in∣to the boat and filled her halfe full of water: but by Gods good will, and the care∣full stearage of Captaine <HI>Cook,</HI> though our provisions were much wet we safe es∣caped, the wind blew hard at Northeast, which caused so great a current and a breach vpon the barre; Captaine <HI>Spicer</HI> passed halfe over, but by the indiscreet steering of <HI>Ralph Skinner,</HI> their boat was overset, the men that could catch hold hung about her, the next sea cast her on ground, where some let goe their hold to wade to shore, but the sea beat them downe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Spi∣cer</HI> and seauen others drow∣ned.</NOTE> The boat thus tossed vp and downe Captaine <HI>Spicer</HI> and <HI>Skinner</HI> hung there till they were drowne; but 4. that could swim a little, kept themselues in deeper water, were saued by the meanes of Cap∣taine <HI>Cook,</HI> that presently vpon the oversetting of their boat, shipped himselfe to saue what he could. Thus of eleuen, seuen of the chiefest were drowned. This so discomfited all the Saylers, we had much to do to get them any more to seeke fur∣ther for the Planters, but by their Captaines forwardnes at last they fitted them∣selues againe for <HI>Hatorask</HI> in 2 boats, with 19 persons. It was late ere we arrived, but seeing a fire through the woods, we sounded a Trumpet, but no answer could we heare. The next morning we went to it, but could see nothing but the grasse, and some rotten trees burning. We went vp and downe the Ile, and at last found three faire Romane Letters carved. <HI>C.R.O.</HI> which presently we knew to signifie the place where I should find them, according to a secret note betweene them &amp; me: which was to write the name of the place they would be in, vpon some tree, dore, or post: and if they had beene in any distresse, to signifie it by making a crosse o∣ver it. For at my departure they intended to goe fiftie myles into the mayne. But we found no signe of distresse; then we went to a place where they were left in sundry houses, but we found them all taken downe, and the place strongly inclo∣sed with a high Palizado, very Fortlike; and in one of the chiefe Posts carued in fayre capitall Letters <HI>CROATAN,</HI> without any signe of distresse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They finde where they had buryed their provisi∣ons.</NOTE> and many barres of Iron, two pigs of Lead, foure Fowlers, Iron shot, and such like heauie things throwne here and there, overgrowne with grasse and weeds. We went by the shore to seeke for their boats but could find none, nor any of the Ordnance I left them. At last some of the Sailers found divers Chists had beene hidden and digged vp againe, and much of the goods spoyled, and scattered vp and downe, which when I saw, I knew three of them to be my owne; but bookes, pictures, and all things els were spoyled.

<P><PB N="17" REF="17"/>At length we came among these fayre Iles, some a league,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Martha's</HI> Vineyard.</NOTE> 2.3.5. or 6. from the Mayne, by one of them we anchored. We found it foure myles in compasse, with∣out house or inhabitant. In it is a lake neare a myle in circuit; the rest overgrowne with trees, which so well as the bushes, were so overgrowne with Vines, we could scarce passe them. And by the blossomes we might perceiue there would be plen∣ty of Strawberries, Respises, Gousberries, and divers other fruits: besides, Deere and other Beasts we saw, and Cranes, Hernes, with divers other sorts of fowle; which made vs call it <HI>Martha's Vineyard.</HI></P>
<P>The rest of the Isles are replenished with such like; very rocky,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Elizabeths</HI> Island.</NOTE> and much tinc∣tured stone like Minerall. Though we met many <HI>Indians,</HI> yet we could not see their habitations: they gaue vs fish, Tobacco, and such things as they had. But the next Isle we arrived at was but two leagues from the Maine, &amp; 16. myle about, invironed so with creekes and coves, it seemed like many Isles linked together by small passages like bridges. In it is many places of plaine grasse, and such other fruits, and berries as before were mentioned. In mid-May we did sow Wheat, Barley, Oates, &amp; Pease, which in 14. dayes sprung vp 9. inches. The soyle is fat and lusty: the crust therof gray, a foot or lesse in depth. It is full of high timbred Okes, their leaues thrise so broad as ours: Cedar straight and tall, Beech, Holly, Walnut, Hazell, Cherry trees like ours, but the stalke beareth the blossom or fruit thereof like a cluster of Grapes, forty or fiftie in a bunch. There is a tree of Orange colour, whose barke in the filing is as smooth as Velvet. There is a lake of fresh water three myles in compasse, in the midst an Isle containing an acre or thereabout, o∣vergrowne with wood: here are many Tortoises, and abundance of all sorts of foules, whose young ones we tooke and cate at our pleasure. Grounds nuts as big as egges, as good as Potatoes, and 40. on a string, not two ynches vnder ground. All sorts of shell fish, as Schalops, Mussels, Cockles, Crabs, Lobsters, Welks, Oy∣sters, exceeding good and very great; but not to cloy you with particulars, what God and nature hath bestowed on those places, I refer you to the Authors owne writing at large. We called this Isle <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Isle, from whence we went right o∣ver to the mayne, where we stood a while as ravished at the beautie and dilicacy of the sweetnesse, besides divers cleare lakes, whereof we saw no end, &amp; meadows very large and full of greene grasse, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here we espyed 7. Salvages, at first they expressed some feare, but by our cour∣teous vsage of them, they followed vs to the necke of Land, which we thought had beene severed from the Mayne, but we found it otherwise. Here we imagi∣ned was a river, but because the day was farre spent, we left to discover it till bet∣ter leasure. But of good Harbours, there is no doubt, considering the Land is all rocky and broken lands. The next day we determined to fortifie our selues in the Isle in the lake. Three weekes we spent in building vs there a house. But the se∣cond day after our comming from the Mayne, 11. Canows with neare 50. Salva∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s came towards vs. Being vnwilling they should see our building, we went to, &amp; exchanged with them Kniues, Hatchets, Beades, Bels, and such trifles, for some Bevers, Lyzards, Martins, Foxes, wilde Catte skinnes, and such like. We saw them haue much red Copper, whereof they make chaines, collars, and drinking cups,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A 'Copper Mine.</NOTE> which they so little esteemed they would giue vs for small toyes, &amp; signified vnto vs they had it out of the earth in the Mayne: three dayes they stayed with vs, but every night retyred two or three myle from vs: after with many signes of loue and friendship they departed, seaven of them staying behind, that did helpe vs to dig and carry Saxafras, and doe any thing they could, being of a comely proportion and the best condition of any Salvages we had yet incountred. They haue no Beards but counterfeits, as they did thinke ours also was: for which they would haue changed with some of our men that had great beards. Some of the baser sort would steale; but the better sort, we found very civill and iust. We saw but three of their women, and they were but of meane stature, attyred in skins like the men,
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
but fat and well favoured. The wholesomenesse and temperature of this climate, doth not onely argue the people to be answerable to this Description, but also of a perfect constitution of body, actiue, strong, healthfull, and very witty, as the sundry toyes by them so cunningly wrought may well testifie. For our selues, we found our selues rather increase in health and strength then otherwise; for all our toyle, bad dyet and lodging; yet not one of vs was touched with any sicknesse. Twelue intended here a while to haue stayed, but vpon better consideration, how meanely we were provided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their return.</NOTE> we left this Island (with as many true sorrowfull eyes as were before desirous to see it) the 18. of Iune, and arrived at <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mouth,</HI> the 23 of Iuly.</P>

to sea; and the 24 of Aprill fell with <HI>Flowres</HI> and <HI>Coruos.</HI> We intended as we were directed towards the Southward of 39. But the winds so crossed vs wee fell more Northwards about 41. and 20. minuits, we sounded at 100. fathom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dangerous shoules.</NOTE> &amp; by that we had run 6 leagues we had but 5. yet saw no land; from the mayne top we descryed a whitish sandy clift, West North-west some 6. leagues from vs, but ere we had run two leagues further we found many shoules and breaches, sometimes in 4. fadom and the next throw 15. or 18. Being thus imbayed among those shoules, we were constrained to put back againe, which we did with no small danger, though both the winde and weather were as fayre as we could desire. Thus we parted from the Land, which we had not before so much desired, and at the first sight reioyced, as now we all ioyfully praysed God that he had delivered vs from so eminent dan∣ger. Here we found excellent Cod,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cod and Whales.</NOTE> and saw many Whales as we had done 2. or 3. daies before. Being thus constrained to put to sea, the want of wood &amp; water cau∣sed vs take the best advantage of the winde, to fall with the shore wheresoever: but we found our Sea cards most directly false. The 17. of May we made the Land a∣gaine, but it blew so hard, we durst not approach it. The next day it appeared to vs a mayne high land, but we found it an Island of 6. myles in compasse: within a league of it we came to an anchor, and went on shore for wood &amp; water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their first landing.</NOTE> of which we found sufficient. The water gushing forth downe the rocky clifts in many pla∣ces, which are all overgrown with Firre, Birch, Beech, &amp; Oke, as the Verge is with Gousberries, Strawberries, wild Pease, and Rose bushes, and much foule of divers sorts that breed among the rockes: here as in all places els where we came, we found Cod enough.</P>
<P>From hence we might discerne the mayne land and very high mountaines, the next day because we rode too open to the Sea, we waighed, and came to the Isles adioyning to the mayn: among which we found an excellent rode, defended from all windes, for ships of any burthen, in 6.7.8.9. or 10. fadom vpon a clay oze. This was vpon a Whitsonday, wherefore we called it <HI>Pentecost Harbour.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pentecost</HI> har∣bour.</NOTE> Here I cannot omit for foolish feare of imputation of flattery, the painfull industry of our Cap∣taine, who as at Sea he was alwayes most carefull &amp; vigilant, so at land he refused no paines: but his labour was ever as much or rather more then any mans; which not onely incouraged others with better content, but also effected much with great expedition. We digged a Garden the 22. of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Captains diligence.</NOTE> where among our garden-seeds we sowed Pease and Barley, which in 16. dayes grew vp 8. ynches, although this was but the crust of the ground, and much inferiour to the mould we after found in the mayne.</P>
<P>After we had taken order for all our necessary businesses, we marched through two of these Isles. The biggest was 4. or 5. myles in compasse; we found here all sorts of ordinary trees, besides, Vines, Currants, Spruce, Yew, Angelica, and divers gummes: in so much many of our company wished themselues setled here. Vpon the 30. our Captaine with 13. went to discover the mayne: we in the ship espyed 3. Canowes that came towards the ship. Which after they had well viewed, one of them came aboord with 3. men, and by our good vsage of them not long after the rest, two dayes we had their companies, in all respects they are but like them at <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Isles, therefore this may suffice for their description. In this time our Captain had discovered a fayre river, trending into the mayne 40 myles, and returned backe to bring in the ship. The Salvages also kept their words and brought vs 40. Bever, Oter, and sable skins, for the value of 5. shillings in kniues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade with the Salvages.</NOTE> glasses, combes, and such toyes, and thus we vsed them so kindly as we could, be∣cause we intended to inhabit in their Country, they lying aboord with vs and we ashore with them; but it was but as changing man for man as hostages, and in this manner many times we had their companies.</P>
<P>At last they desired our Captaine to goe with them to the mayne to trade with their <HI>Bashabes,</HI> which is their chiefe Lord, which we did, our boat well manned with
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
14. yet would they row faster with 3. Ores in their Canowes then we with 8. but when we saw our old acquaintance, would not stay aboord vs as before for ho∣stage, but did what they could to draw vs into a narrow c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke, we exchanged one <HI>Owen Griffin</HI> with them for a yong fellow of theirs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their treche∣ry.</NOTE> that he might see if he could discover any trechery, as he did, for he found there assembled 283. Salvages with bowes &amp; arrows, but not any thing at all to trade as they pretended. These things considered, we conceited them to be but as all Salvages ever had beene, kinde till they found opportunitie to do mischiefe. Wherefoer we determined to take some of them, before they should suspect we had discovered their plot, lest they should absent themselues from vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiue Salvages surprised.</NOTE> so the first that ever after came into the ship were three which we kept, and two we tooke on shore with much adoe, with two Canowes, their bowes and arrowes.</P>
<P>Some time we spent in sounding all the Isles, channels, and inlets thereabouts, and we found 4. severall waies a ship might be brought into this Bay. In the inte∣rim there came 2. Canowes more boldly aboord vs, signifying we should bring our ship to the place where he dwelt to trade. We excused our selues why we could not, but vsed them kindly, yet got them away with all the speed we could, that they should not be perceiued by them in the houle, then we went vp the ri∣ver 26. myles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A description of the river.</NOTE> of which I had rather not write, then by my relation detract from it, it is in breadth a myle, neare 40. myles; and a channell of 6.7.8.9. or 10. fadom, &amp; on both sides every halfe myle gallant Coues, to containe in many of them 100 sayle, where they may lye on Oze without Cable or Anchor, onely mored with a Hanser, and it floweth 18. foot, that you may make, docke, or carine ships with much facilitie: besides the land is most rich, trending all along on both sides in an equall plaine, neither rocky nor mountainous, but verged with a greene border of grasse, doth make tender to the beholder her pleasant fertilitie, if by cleansing away the woods she were converted into meadow.</P>
<P>The woods are great, and tall, such as are spoken of in the Islelands, and well wa∣tered with many fresh springs. Our men that had seene <HI>Oranoque</HI> so famous in the worlds eares, <HI>Reogrande, Loyer,</HI> &amp; <HI>Slion,</HI> report, though they be great &amp; goodly ri∣vers, yet are not comparable to it. Leaving our ship we went higher, till we were 7. myles higher then the salt water flowed; we marched towards the mountains we had seene, but the weather was so hot, &amp; our labour so great, as our Captaine was contented to returne: after we had erected a crosse we left this faire land and river, in which the higher we went the better we liked it, and returned to our ship. By the way we met a Canow that much desired one of our men to go vp to their <HI>Bas∣shabes,</HI> but we knew their intents, and so turned them off; and though we had both time and provision to haue discovered much more, and might haue found perad∣venture good trade, yet because our company was but small, we would not haz∣zard so hopefull a businesse as this was, either for our private, or particular ends, being more regardfull of a publicke good, and promulgating Gods holy Church by planting Christianity, which was the intent of our adventurers so well as ours; returning by the Isles in the entry of the Sound we called them S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Georges</HI> Isles, &amp; because on sunday we set out of <HI>England,</HI> on sunday also the 16. of Iune we de∣parted hence. When we had run 30. leagues we had 40. fadom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen 70. then 100. After 2. or 3. watches more we were in 24. fadoms, where we tooke so much Cod as we did know what to doe with, and the 18. of Iuly came to <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> and all our men as well God be thanked as when they went forth.</P>

The temperature of this Country doth agree well with <HI>English</HI> constitutions, being once seasoned to the Country. Which appeared by this, that though by many oc∣casions our people fell sicke; yet did they recover by very small meanes, and conti∣nued in health, though there were other great causes, not onely to haue made them sicke, but even to end their dayes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Sommer is hot as in <HI>Spaine</HI>; the Winter cold as in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>England.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The tempera∣ture.</NOTE> The heat of sommer is in Iune, Iuly, and August, but commonly the coole Breeses as∣swage the vehemency of the heat. The chiefe of winter is halfe December, Ianuary, February, and halfe March. The colde is extreame sharpe, but here the Proverbe is true, that <HI>no extreame long continueth.</HI></P>
<P>In the yeare 1607. was an extraordinary frost in most of <HI>Europe,</HI> and this frost was found as extreame in <HI>Virginia.</HI> But the next yeare for 8. or 10. dayes of ill weather, other 14. dayes would be as Sommer.</P>
<P>The windes here are variable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The windes.</NOTE> but the like thunder and lightning to purifie the ayre, I haue seldome either seene or heard in <HI>Europe.</HI> From the Southwest came the greatest gusts with thunder and heat. The Northwest winde is commonly coole and bringeth faire weather with it. From the North is the greatest cold, and from the East and Southeast as from the <HI>Barmudas,</HI> fogs and raines.</P>
<P>Some times there are great droughts, other times much raine, yet great necessitie of neither, by reason we see not but that all the raritie of needfull fruits in <HI>Europe,</HI> may be there in great plentie, by the industry of men, as appeareth by those we there Planted.</P>

Here are mountaines, hils, plaines, valleyes, rivers, and brookes, all running most pleasantly into a faire Bay, compassed but for the mouth, with fruitfull and delightsome land. In the Bay and rivers are many Isles both great &amp; small, some woody, some plaine, most of them low and not inhabited. This Bay lyeth North and South, in which the water floweth neare 200. myles, and hath a channell for 140 myles, of depth be∣twixt 6 and 15 fadome, holding in breadth for the most part 10 or 14 myles. From the head of the Bay to the Northwest, the land is mountanous, and so in a manner from thence by a Southwest line; So that the more Southward, the farther off from the Bay are those mountaines. From which fall certaine brookes which after come to fiue principall navigable rivers. These run from the Northwest into the South east, and so into the West side of the Bay, where the fall of every River is within 20 or 15 myles one of another.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The moun∣taines.</NOTE>The mountaines are of divers natures: for at the head of the Bay the rockes are of a composition like Mill stones. Some of Marble, &amp;c. And many peeces like Chri∣stall we found, as throwne downe by water from those mountaines. For in Winter they are covered with much snow, and when it dissolveth the waters fall with such violence, that it causeth great inundations in some narrow valleyes, which is scarce perceived being once in the rivers. These waters wash from the rocks such glistering tinctures, that the ground in some places seemeth as guilded, where both the rocks and the earth are so splendent to behold, <HI>that better iudgements then ours might haue beene perswaded, they contained more then probabilities.</HI> The vesture of the earth in most places doth manifestly proue the nature of the soyle to be lusty and very rich. The colour of the earth we found in diverse places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The soyle.</NOTE> resembleth <HI>bole Armoniac, terra sigil∣lata,</HI> and <HI>Lemnia,</HI> Fullers earth, Marle, and divers other such appearances. But gene∣rally for the most part it is a blacke sandy mould, in some places a fat slimy clay, in o∣ther places a very barren gravell. But the best ground is knowne by the vesture it beareth, as by the greatnesse of trees, or abundance of weeds, &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The valleyes.</NOTE>The Country is not mountanous, nor yet low, but such pleasant plaine hils, and fertile valleyes, one prettily crossing another, &amp; watered so conveniently with fresh brookes and springs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plaines.</NOTE> no lesse commodious, then delightsome. By the rivers are ma∣ny plaine marishes, containing some 20 some 100. some 200 Acres, some more, some lesse. Other plaines there are few, but onely where the Salvages inhabit: but all overgrowne with trees &amp; weeds, being a plaine wildernesse as God first made it.</P>
<P>On the west side of the Bay, we sayd were 5. faire and delightfull navigable rivers.

<P>Having lost our Grapnell among the rocks of <HI>Sasquesahanocks,</HI> we were then neare 200 myles from home, and our Barge about two runs, and had in it but 12 men to performe this Discovery, wherein we lay aboue 12 weekes vpon those great waters in those vnknowne Countries, having nothing but a little meale, oatemeale and wa∣ter to feed vs, and scarce halfe sufficient of that for halfe that time, but what provisi∣on we got among the Salvages, and such rootes and fish as we caught by accident, and Gods direction; nor had we a Mariner nor any had skill to trim the sayles but two saylers and my selfe, the rest being Gentlemen, or them were as ignorant in such toyle and labour. Yet necessitie in a short time by good words and examples made them doe that that caused them ever after to feare no colours. What I did with this small meanes I leaue to the Reader to iudge, and the Mappe I made of the Country, which is but a small matter in regard of the magnitude thereof.

Such great and well proportioned men are seldome seene, for they seemed like Giants to the English, yea and to the neighbours, yet seemed of an honest and simple disposition, with much adoe restrained from ado∣ring vs as Gods.

His arrowes were fiue quar∣ters long, headed with the splinters of a white christall-like stone, in forme of a heart, an inch broad, and an inch and a halfe or more long.

<HEAD>Of such things which are naturally in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and how they vse them.</HEAD>
<P>VIRGINIA doth afford many excellent vegetables, and liuing Creatures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why there is little grasse.</NOTE> yet grasse there is little or none, but what groweth in low Marishes: for all the Countrey is overgrowne with trees, whose droppings continually tur∣neth their grasse to weeds, by reason of the rancknes of the ground, which would soone be amended by good husbandry.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Woods with their fruits.</NOTE> The wood that is most common is Oke and Walnut, many of their Okes are so tall &amp; straight, that they will beare two foote and a halfe square of good timber for 20 yards long; Of this wood there is two or three severall kinds. The Acornes of one kinde, whose barke is more white then the other, &amp; somewhat sweetish, which being boyled, at last affords a sweet oyle, that they keepe in gourds to annoint their heads and ioynts. The fruit they eate made in bread or otherwise. There is also some Elme, some blacke Walnut tree,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Elme.</HI></NOTE> and some Ash: of Ash and Elme they make sope Ashes. If the trees be very great, the Ashes will be good, and melt to hard lumps, but if they be small, it will be but powder, and not so good as the other. Of walnuts there is 2 or 3 kindes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walnuts. Supposed Cypres.</NOTE> there is a kinde of wood we called Cypres, because both the wood, the fruit, and leafe did most resem∣ble it, and of those trees there are some neare three fadome about at the foot, very
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>
straight, and 50, 60, or 80 foot without a branch. By the dwelling of the Salvages are some great Mulbery trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mulberries.</NOTE> and in some parts of the Countrey, they are found growing naturally in prettie groues. There was an assay made to make silke, and surely the wormes prospered excellent well, till the master workeman fell sicke. During which time they were eaten with Rats.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chesnuts.</NOTE>In some parts were found some Chesnuts, whose wild fruit equalize the best in <HI>France, Spaine, Germany,</HI> or <HI>Italy.</HI> Plums there are of three sorts. The red and white are like our hedge plums, but the other which they call <HI>Putchamins,</HI> grow as high as a <HI>Palmeta</HI>: the fruit is like a Medler; it is first greene, then yellow, and red when it is ripe; if it be not ripe, it will draw a mans mouth awry, with much torment, but when it is ripe, it is as delicious as an Apricot.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cherries.</NOTE>They haue Cherries, and those are much like a Damson, but for their tastes and colour we called them Cherries. We saw some few Crabs, but very small and bitter. Of vines great abundance in many parts that climbe the toppes of the highest trees in some places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vines.</NOTE> but these beare but few grapes. Except by the rivers &amp; savage habita∣tions, where they are not overshadowed from the sunne, they are covered with fruit, though never pruined nor manured. Of those hedge grapes we made neere twentie gallons of wine, which was like our French Brittish wine, but certainely they would proue good were they well manured. There is another sort of grape neere as great as a Cherry, this they call <HI>Messamins,</HI> they be satte, and the iuyce thicke. Neither doth the taste so well please when they are made in wine. They haue a small fruit growing on little trees, husked like a Chesnut, but the fruit most like a very small Acorne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chechinqua∣mins.</NOTE> This they call <HI>Chechinquamins,</HI> which they esteeme a great daintie. They haue a berry much like our Gooseberry, in greatnesse, colour, and tast; those they call <HI>Rawcomens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rawcomens.</NOTE> and doe eat them raw or boyled. Of these naturall fruits they liue a great part of the yeare, which they vse in this manner; The Walnuts, Chesnuts, A∣cornes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they vse their fruits.</NOTE> and <HI>Chechinquamins</HI> are dryed to keepe. When they need walnuts they breake them betweene two stones, yet some part of the shels will cleaue to the fruit. Then doe they dry them againe vpon a Mat over a hurdle. After they put it into a morter of wood, and beat it very small: that done they mix it with water, that the shels may sinke to the bottome. This water will be coloured as milke, which they call <HI>Pawco∣hiccora,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Walnut mille.</NOTE> and keepe it for their vse. The fruit like Medlers they call <HI>Putchamins,</HI> they cast vpon hurdles on a Mat, and preserue them as Pruines. Of their Chesnuts and <HI>Chechinquamins</HI> boyled, they make both broath and bread for their chiefe men, or at their greatest feasts. Besides those fruit trees, there is a white Po∣pular, and another tree like vnto it, that yeeldeth a very cleare and an odoriferous <HI>Gumme</HI> like <HI>Turpentine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gummes.

Raw it is no better then poyson, and being rosted, except it be tender and the heat a∣bated, or sliced and dryed in the Sunne, mixed with sorrell and meale or such like, it will prickle and torment the throat extreamely, and yet in sommer they vse this ordinarily for bread.</P>
<P>They haue another roote which they call <HI>Wighsacan:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sacan</HI> a roote. <HI>Pocones</HI> a small roote.</NOTE> as th'other feedeth the bo∣dy, so this cureth their hurts and diseases. It is a small root which they bruise and apply to the wound. <HI>Pocones</HI> is a small root that groweth in the mountaines, which being dryed and beate in powder turneth red. And this they vse for swellings, aches, annointing their ioynts, painting their heads and garments. They account it very precious, and of much worth. <HI>Musquaspen</HI> is a roote of the bignesse of a finger,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Musquaspen</HI> a roote.</NOTE> and as red as bloud.

The stalke being greene hath a sweet iuice in it, somewhat like a sugar Cane, which is the cause that when they gather their corne greene, they sucke the stalkes: for as we gather greene pease, so doe they their corne being greene, which excelleth their old. They plant also pease they call <HI>Assentamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which are the same they call in <HI>Italy, Fag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.</HI> Their Beanes are the same the Turkes call <HI>Garnanses,</HI> but these they much esteeme for dainties.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they vse their Corne.</NOTE>Their corne they rost in the eare greene, and bruising it in a morter of wood with a Polt, lap it in rowles in the leaues of their corne, and so boyle it for a daintie. They also reserue that corne late planted that will not ripe, by roasting it in hot ashes, the heat thereof drying it. In winter they esteeme it being boyled with beanes for a rare dish, they call <HI>Pausarowmena.</HI> Their old wheat they first steepe a night in hot water, in the morning pounding it in a morter. They vse a small basket for their Temmes, then pound againe the great, and so separating by dashing their hand in the basket, receiue the flower in a platter made of wood, scraped to that forme with burning

and shels. Tempering this flower with water, they make it either in cakes, covering them with ashes till they be baked, and then washing them in faire water, they drie presently with their owne heat: or else boyle them in water, eating the broth with the bread which they call <HI>Ponap.</HI> The grouces and peeces of the cornes remaining, by fanning in a Platter or in the wind, away, the branne they boyle 3 or 4 houres with water, which is an ordinary food they call <HI>Vstatahamen.</HI> But some more thriftie then cleanly, doe burne the core of the eare to powder, which they call <HI>Pungnough,</HI> mingling that in their meale, but it never tasted well in bread, nor broth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they vse their fish and flesh.</NOTE> Their fish &amp; flesh they boyle either very tenderly, or boyle it so long on hurdles over the fire, or else after the <HI>Spanish</HI> fashion, putting it on a spit, they turne first the one side, then the other, till it be as drie as their ierkin Beefe in the west <HI>Indies,</HI> that they may keepe it a moneth or more without putrifying. The broth of fish or flesh they eat as com∣monly as the meat.</P>
<P>In May also amongst their corne they plant <HI>Pumpeons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Planted fruits</NOTE> and a fruit like vnto a muske mellon, but lesse and worse, which they call <HI>Macocks.</HI> These increase exceedingly, and ripen in the beginning of Iuly, and continue vntill September. They plant also <HI>Maracocks</HI> a wild fruit like a Lemmon, which also increase infinitely. They begin to ripe in September, and continue till the end of October. When all their fruits be gathered, little els they plant, and this is done by their women and children; neither doth this long suffice them, for neare three parts of the yeare, they onely ob∣serue times and seasons, and liue of what the Country naturally affordeth from hand to mouth, &amp;c.</P>

<P>THe mildnesse of the ayre, the fertilitie of the soyle, and situation of the rivers are so propitious to the nature and vse of man, as no place is more conveni∣ent for pleasure, profit, and mans sustenance, vnder that latitude or climat.

All these temporize with other for neces∣sities, but all as vncertaine as peace or warres. Besides the charge, travell, and danger in transporting them, by seas, lands, stormes, and Pyrats. Then how much hath <HI>Virginia</HI> the prerogatiue of all those flourishing Kingdomes, for the benefit of our Land, when as within one hundred myles all those are to be had, either ready pro∣vided by nature, or else to be prepared, were there but industrious men to labour. Onely of Copper we may doubt is wanting, but there is good probabilitie that both Copper and better Minerals are there to be had for their labour. Other Countries haue it. So then here is a place, a nurse for souldiers, a practise for mariners, a trade for marchants, a reward for the good, and that which is most of all, a businesse (most acceptable to God) to bring such poore Infidels to the knowledge of God and his holy Gospell.</P>

As small as the pro∣portion of ground that hath yet beene discovered, is in comparison of that yet vn∣knowne: the people differ very much in stature, especially in language, as before is expressed. Some being very great as the <HI>Sasquesahanecks</HI>; others very little, as the <HI>Wighcocomocoes</HI>: but generally tall and straight, of a comely proportion, and of a co∣lour browne when they are of any age, but they are borne white. Their hayre is ge∣nerally blacke, but few haue any beards. The men weare halfe their beards shaven, the other halfe long; for Barbers they vse their women, who with two shels will grate away the hayre, of any fashion they please. The women are cut in many fashions, a∣greeable to their yeares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The constitu∣tion.</NOTE> but ever some part remaineth long. They are very strong, of an able body and full of agilitie, able to endure to lie in the woods vnder a tree by the fire, in the worst of winter, or in the weedes and grasse, in Ambuscado in the Sommer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The disposi∣tion.</NOTE> They are inconstant in every thing, but what feare constraineth them to keepe. Craftie, timerous, quicke of apprehension, and very ingenuous. Some are of disposition fearefull, some bold, most cautelous, all Savage. Generally covetous of Copper, Beads, and such like trash. They are soone moued to anger, and so malici∣ous, that they seldome forget an iniury: they seldome steale one from another, least their coniurers should reveale it, and so they be pursued and punished. That they are thus feared is certaine, but that any can reueale their offences by coniuration I am doubtfull. Their women are carefull not to be suspected of dishonestie without the leaue of their husbands. Each houshold knoweth their owne lands, and gardens, and most liue of their owne labours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The possessi∣ons.</NOTE> For their apparell, they are sometime covered with the skinnes of wilde beasts, which in Winter are dressed with the hayre, but in Sommer without.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their attire.</NOTE> The better sort vse large mantels of Deare skins, not much dif∣fering in fashion from the Irish mantels. Some imbrodered with white beads, some with Copper, other painted after their manner. But the common sort haue scarce to cover their nakednesse, but with grasse, the leaues of trees, or such like. We haue seene some vse mantels made of Turky feathers, so prettily wrought &amp; woven with threads that nothing could be discerned but the feathers. That was exceeding warme and very handsome. But the women are alwayes covered about their middles with a skin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their orna∣ments.</NOTE> and very shamefast to be seene bare. They adorne themselues most with cop∣per beads and paintings. Their women, some haue their legs, hands, breasts and face cunningly imbrodered with divers workes, as beasts, serpents, artificially wrought into their flesh with blacke spots. In each eare commonly they haue 3 great holes, whereat they hang chaines, bracelets, or copper. Some of their men weare in those holes, a small greene and yellow coloured snake, neare halfe a yard in length, which crawling and lapping her selfe about his necke oftentimes familiarly would kisse his lips. Others weare a dead Rat tyed by the taile. Some on their heads weare the wing of a bird, or some large feather with a Rattell. Those Rattels are somewhat like the chape of a Rapier, but lesse, which they take from the taile of a snake. Many haue the whole skinne of a Hawke or some strange foule, stuffed with the wings abroad. O∣thers a broad peece of Copper, and some the hand of their enemy dryed. Their heads and shoulders are painted red with the roote <HI>Pocone</HI> brayed to powder, mixed with oyle, this they hold in sommer to preserue them from the heate, and in winter from the cold. Many other formes of paintings they vse, but he is the most gallant that is the most monstrous to behold.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their buil∣dings.</NOTE>Their buildings and habitations are for the most part by the rivers, or not farre di∣stant from some fresh spring. Their houses are built like our Arbors, of small young springs bowed and tyed, and so close covered with Mats, or the barkes of trees very handsomely, that notwithstanding either winde, raine, or weather, they are as warme as stooues, but very smoaky, yet at the toppe of the house there is a hole made for the smoake to goe into right over the fire.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="26"/>Against the fire they lie on little hurdles of Reeds covered with a Mat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their lod∣gings.</NOTE> borne from the ground a foote and more by a hurdle of wood. On these round about the house they lie heads and points one by th'other against the fire, some covered with Mats, some with skins, and some starke naked lie on the ground, from 6 to 20 in a house. Their houses are in the midst of their fields or gardens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their gardens</NOTE> which are small plots of ground. Some 20 acres, some 40. some 100. some 200. some more, some lesse. In some places from 2 to 50 of those houses together, or but a little separated by groues of trees. Neare their habitations is little small wood or old trees on the ground by rea∣son of their burning of them for fire. So that a man may gallop a horse amongst these woods any way, but where the creekes or Rivers shall hinder.</P>
<P>Men, women,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they vse their children.</NOTE> and children haue their severall names according to the severall humor of their Parents. Their women (they say) are easily delivered of childe, yet doe they loue children very dearely. To make them hardie, in the coldest mornings they them wash in the rivers, and by painting and oyntments so tanne their skinnes, that after a yeare or two, no weather will hurt them.</P>
<P>The men bestow their times in fishing, hunting, warres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The industrie of their wo∣men.</NOTE> and such man-like exer∣cises, scorning to be seene in any woman-like exercise, which is the cause that the wo∣men be very painefull, and the men often idle. The women and children doe the rest of the worke. They make mats, baskets, pots, morters, pound their corne, make their bread, prepare their victuals, plant their corne, gather their corne, beare all kind of burdens, and such like.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they strike fire.</NOTE>Their fire they kindle presently by chafing a dry pointed sticke in a hole of a little square peece of wood, that firing it selfe, will so fire mosse, leaues, or any such like dry thing, that will quickly burne. In March and Aprill they liue much vpon their fishing wires; and feed on fish, Turkies, and Squirrels.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of dyet.</NOTE> In May and Iune they plant their fields, and liue most of Acornes, Walnuts, and fish. But to amend their dyet, some disperse themselues in small companies, and liue vpon fish, beasts, crabs, oy∣sters, land Tortoises, strawberries, mulberries, and such like. In Iune, Iuly, and August, they feed vpon the rootes of <HI>Tocknough</HI> berries, fish, and greene wheat. It is strange to see how their bodies alter with their dyet, even as the deere &amp; wilde beasts they seeme fat and leane, strong and weake. <HI>Powhatan</HI> their great King, and some others that are provident, rost their fish and flesh vpon hurdles as before is expressed, and keepe it till scarce times.</P>
<P>For fishing, hunting, and warres they vse much their bow and arrowes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they make their bow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and arrowes.</NOTE> They bring their bowes to the forme of ours by the scraping of a shell. Their arrowes are made some of straight young sprigs, which they head with bone, some 2 or 3 ynches long. These they vse to shoot at Squirrels on trees. Another sort of arrowes they vse made of Reeds. These are peeced with wood, headed with splinters of christall, or some sharpe stone, the spurres of a Turkey, or the bill of some bird.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their kniues.</NOTE> For his knife he hath the splinter of a Reed to cut his feathers in forme. With this knife also, he will ioynt a Deere, or any beast, shape his shooes, buskins, mantels, &amp;c. To make the noch of his arrow he hath the tooth of a Beaver, set in a sticke, wherewith he gra∣teth it by degrees. His arrow head he quickly maketh with a little bone, which he ever weareth at his bracert, of any splint of a stone, or glasse in the forme of a heart, and these they glew to the end of their arrowes. With the sinewes of Deere, and the tops of Deeres hornes boyled to a ielly, they make a glew that will not dissolue in cold water.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Targets and Swords.</NOTE>For their warres also they vse Targets that are round and made of the barkes of trees, and a sword of wood at their backes, but oftentimes they vse for swords the horne of a Deere put through a peece of wood in forme of a Pickaxe. Some a long stone sharpned at both ends, vsed in the same manner. This they were wont to vse also for hatchets, but now by trucking they haue plentie of the same forme of yron. And those are their chiefe instruments and armes.</P>
<P>Their fishing is much in Boats.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Boats.</NOTE> These they make of one tree by burning and scratching away the coales with stones and shels, till they haue made it in forme of a

Trough. Some of them are an elne deepe, and fortie or fiftie foote in length, and some will beare 40 men, but the most ordinary are smaller, and will beare 10, 20, or 30. according to their bignesse. In stead of Oares, they vse Paddles and stickes, with which they will row faster then our Barges.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they spin.</NOTE> Betwixt their hands and thighes, their women vse to spin, the barkes of trees, Deere sinewes, or a kind of grasse they call <HI>Pemmenaw,</HI> of these they make a thread very even and readily. This thread serveth for many vses. As about their housing, apparell, as also they make nets for fishing, for the quantitie as formally braded as ours. They make also with it lines for angles. Their hookes are either a bone grated as they noch their arrowes in the forme of a crooked pinne or fish-hooke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fish-hookes.</NOTE> or of the splinter of a bone tyed to the clift of a little sticke, and with the end of the line, they tie on the bait. They vse also long arrowes tyed in a line, wherewith they shoote at fish in the rivers. But they of <HI>Accawmack</HI> vse staues like vnto Iauelins headed with bone. With these they dart fish swimming in the water. They haue also many artificiall wires, in which they get abundance of fish.</P>
<P>In their hunting and fishing they take extreame paines; yet it being their ordinary exercise from their infancy, they esteeme it a pleasure and are very proud to be ex∣pert therein. And by their continuall ranging, and travell, they know all the advan∣tages and places most frequented with Deere, Beasts, Fish, Foule, Roots, and Berries. At their huntings they leaue their habitations, and reduce themselues into compa∣nies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they hunt.</NOTE> as the <HI>Tartars</HI> doe, and goe to the most desert places with their families, where they spend their time in hunting and fowling vp towards the mountaines, by the heads of their rivers, where there is plentie of game. For betwixt the rivers the grounds are so narrowe, that little commeth here which they devoure not. It is a marvell they can so directly passe these deserts, some 3 or 4 dayes iourney without habitation. Their hunting houses are like vnto Arbours covered with Mats. These their women beare after them, with Corne, Acornes, Morters, and all bag and bag∣gage they vse. When they come to the place of exercise, every man doth his best to shew his dexteritie, for by their excelling in those qualities, they get their wiues. Fortie yards will they shoot levell, or very neare the marke, and 120 is their best at Random. At their huntings in the deserts they are commonly two or three hundred together. Having found the Deere, they environ them with many fires, &amp; betwixt the fires they place themselues. And some take their stands in the midsts. The Deere being thus feared by the fires, and their voyces, they chase them so long within that circle, that many times they kill 6, 8, 10, or 15 at a hunting. They vse also to driue them into some narrow poynt of land, when they find that advantage; and so force them into the river, where with their boats they haue <HI>Ambuscadoes</HI> to kill them. When they haue shot a Deere by land, they follow him like bloud-hounds by the bloud, and straine, and oftentimes so take them. Hares, Partridges, Turkies, or Egges, fat or leane, young or old, they devoure all they can catch in their power. In one of these huntings they found me in the discovery of the head of the river of <HI>Chicka∣hamania,</HI> where they slew my men, and tooke me prisoner in a Bogmire, where I saw those exercises, and gathered these Observations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">One Salvage hunting a∣lone.</NOTE>One Salvage hunting alone, vseth the skinne of a Deere slit on the one side, and so put on his arme, through the neck, so that his hand comes to the head which is stuf∣fed, and the hornes, head, eyes, eares, and every part as artificially counterfeited as they can devise. Thus shrowding his body in the skinne by stalking, he approacheth the Deere, creeping on the ground from one tree to another. If the Deere chance to find fault, or stand at gaze, he turneth the head with his hand to his best advantage to seeme like a Deere, also gazing and licking himselfe. So watching his best advan∣tage to approach, having shot him, he chaseth him by his bloud and straine till he get him.</P>

They haue many enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ene∣mies.</NOTE> namely, all their westernly Countries beyond the mountaines, and the heads of the rivers. Vpon the head of the <HI>Powhatans</HI> are the <HI>Monacans,</HI> whose chiefe habitation is at <HI>Rasauweak,</HI> vnto whom the <HI>Mowhemenchughes,</HI> the <HI>Massinnacacks,</HI> the <HI>Mona∣hassanughs,</HI> the <HI>Monasickapanoughs,</HI> and other nations pay tributes.

<P>Against all these enemies the <HI>Powhatans</HI> are constrained sometimes to fight. Their chiefe attempts are by Stratagems, trecheries, or surprisals. Yet the <HI>Werowances</HI> wo∣men and children they put not to death, but keepe them Captiues. They haue a me∣thod in warre, and for our pleasures they shewed it vs, and it was in this manner performed at <HI>Mattapanient.</HI></P>
<P>Having painted and disguised themselues in the fiercest manner they could devise.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Battell.</NOTE> They divided themselues into two Companies, neare a hundred in a company. The one company called <HI>Monacans,</HI> the other <HI>Powhatans.</HI> Either army had their Cap∣taine. These as enemies tooke their stands a musket shot one from another; ranked themselues 15 a breast, and each ranke from another 4 or 5 yards, not in fyle, but in the opening betwixt their fyles. So the Reare could shoot as conveniently as the Front. Having thus pitched the fields: from either part went a messenger with these conditions, that whosoever were vanquished, such as escape vpon their submission in two dayes after should liue, but their wiues and children should be prize for the Conquerours. The messengers were no sooner returned, but they approached in their orders; On each flanke a Serieant, and in the Reare an Officer for Lieutenant, all duly keeping their orders, yet leaping and singing after their accustomed tune, which they onely vse in Warres. Vpon the first flight of arrowes they gaue such hor∣rible shouts and screeches, as so many infernall hell hounds could not haue made them more terrible. When they had spent their arrowes, they ioyned together pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tily, charging and retyring, every ranke seconding other. As they got advantage they catched their enemies by the hayre of the head, and downe he came that was taken. His enemy with his wooden sword seemed to beat out his braines, and still they crept to the Reare, to maintaine the skirmish. The <HI>Monacans</HI> decreasing, the <HI>Powhatans</HI> charged them in the forme of a halfe Moone; they vnwilling to be in∣closed, fled all in a troope to their <HI>Ambuscadoes,</HI> on whom they led them very cun∣ningly.

<HI>Powhatans</HI> retired, with all speed to their seconds; which the <HI>Monacans</HI> seeing, tooke that advantage to retire againe to their owne battell, and so each returned to their owne quarter. All their actions, voyces, and gestures, both in charging and retiring were so strained to the height of their qualitie and nature, that the strangenesse thereof made it seeme very delightfull.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Mu∣sicke.</NOTE>For their Musicke they vse a thicke Cane, on which they pipe as on a Recorder. For their warres they haue a great deepe platter of wood. They cover the mouth thereof with a skin, at each corner they tie a walnut, which meeting on the backside neere the bottome, with a small rope they twitch them together till it be so tought and stiffe, that they may beat vpon it as vpon a drumme. But their chiefe instru∣ments are Rattles made of small gourds, or Pumpeons shels. Of these they haue Base, Tenor, Countertenor, Meane, and Treble.

After this doe two or more of their chiefest men make an Orati∣on, testifying their loue. Which they doe with such vehemency, and so great passi∣ons, that they sweat till they drop, and are so out of breath they can scarce speake. So that a man would take them to be exceeding angry, or stark mad.

<HEAD>Of their Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THere is yet in <HI>Virginia</HI> no place discovered to be so Savage, in which they haue not a Religion, Deere, and Bow, and Arrowes. All things that are a∣ble to doe them hurt beyond their prevention, they adore with their kinde of divine worship; as the fire, water, lightning, thunder, our Ordnance, pee∣ces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their God.</NOTE> horses, &amp;c. But their chiefe God they worship is the Devill. Him they call <HI>Okee,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="28"/>
and serue him more of feare then loue. They say they haue conference with him, and fashion themselues as neare to his shape as they can imagine. In their Temples they haue his image euill favouredly carved, and then painted and adorned with chaines of copper, and beads, and covered with a skin, in such manner as the defor∣mitie may well suit with such a God. By him is commonly the sepulcher of their Kings. Their bodies are first bowelled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they bu∣ry their Kings</NOTE> then dried vpon hurdles till they be very dry, and so about the most of their ioynts and necke they hang bracelets, or chaines of copper, pearle, and such like, as they vse to weare, their inwards they stuffe with copper beads, hatchets, and such trash. Then lappe they them very carefully in white skins, and so rowle them in mats for their winding sheets. And in the Tombe which is an arch made of mats, they lay them orderly. What remaineth of this kinde of wealth their Kings haue, they set at their feet in baskets. These Temples and bodies are kept by their Priests.</P>
<P>For their ordinary burials, they dig a deepe hole in the earth with sharpe stakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ordina∣ry burials.</NOTE> and the corpse being lapped in skins and mats with their iewels, they lay them vpon stickes in the ground, and so cover them with earth. The buriall ended, the women being painted all their faces with blacke cole and oyle, doe sit twenty-foure houres in the houses mourning and lamenting by turnes, with such yelling and howling, as may expresse their great passions.</P>
<P>In every Territory of a <HI>Werowance</HI> is a Temple and a Priest, two or three or more.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tem∣ples.</NOTE> Their principall Temple or place of superstition is at <HI>Vitamussack</HI> at <HI>Pamavnk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> neare vnto which is a house, Temple, or place of <HI>Powhatans.</HI></P>
<P>Vpon the top of certaine red sandy hils in the woods, there are three great houses filled with images of their Kings, and Devils, and Tombes of their Predecessors. Those houses are neare sixtie foot in length built arbour-wise, after their building. This place they count so holy as that but the Priests &amp; Kings dare come into them; nor the Salvages dare not goe vp the river in boats by it, but they solemnly cast some peece of copper, white beads, or <HI>Pocones</HI> into the river, for feare their <HI>Okee</HI> should be offended and revenged of them.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Thus,</HI> Feare was the first their Gods begot:</L>
<L>Till feare began, their Gods were not.</L>
</LG>
<P>In this place commonly are resident seauen Priests.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their orna∣ments for their Priests.</NOTE> The chiefe differed from the rest in his ornaments, but inferior Priests could hardly be knowne from the com∣mon people, but that they had not so many holes in their eares to hang their iewels at. The ornaments of the chiefe Priest were certaine attires for his head made thus. They tooke a dosen, or 16, or more snakes skins and stuffed them with mosse, and of Weesels and other Vermines skins a good many. All these they tie by their tailes, so as all their tailes meete in the toppe of their head like a great Tassell. Round about this Tassell is as it were a crowne of feathers, the skins hang round about his head, necke, and shoulders, and in a manner cover his face. The faces of all their Priests are painted as vgly as they can devise, in their hands they had every one his Rattle, some base, some smaller. Their devotion was most in songs, which the chiefe Priest be∣ginneth and the rest followed him, sometimes he maketh invocations with broken sentences by starts and strange passions, and at every pause, the rest giue a short groane.</P>

together, foure or fiue houres. Sometimes they set a man in the midst, and about him they dance and sing, he all the while clapping his hands, as if he would keepe time, and after their songs and dauncings ended they goe to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Feasts.</P>

<P>They haue also divers coniurations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their coniu∣rations.</NOTE> one they made when I was their prisoner; of which hereafter you shall reade at large.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Altars.</NOTE>They haue also certaine Altar stones they call <HI>Pawcorances,</HI> but these stand from their Temples, some by their houses, others in the woods and wildernes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, where they haue had any extraordinary accident, or incounter. And as you travell, at those stones they will tell you the cause why they were there erected, which from age to age they instruct their children, as their best records of antiquities. Vpon these they offer bloud, Deere suet, and Tobacco. This they doe when they returne from the Warres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacrifices to the water.</NOTE> from hunting, and vpon many other occasions. They haue also another su∣perstition that they vse in stormes, when the waters are rough in the Rivers and Sea coasts. Their Coniurers runne to the water sides, or passing in their boats, after ma∣ny hellish outcryes and invocations, they cast Tobacco, Copper, <HI>Pocones,</HI> or such trash into the water, to pacific that God whom they thinke to be very angry in those stormes. Before their dinners and suppers the better sort will take the first bit, and cast it in the fire, which is all the grace they are knowne to vse.</P>
<P>In some part of the Country they haue yearely a sacrifice of children. Such a one was at <HI>Quiyoughcohanock</HI> some ten myles from <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, and thus performed. Fifteene of the properest young boyes, betweene ten and fifteene yeares of age they painted white.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their solemn Sacrifices of children, which they call Black-boyes.</NOTE> Having brought them forth, the people spent the forenoon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in dan∣cing and singing about them with Rattles. In the afternoone they put those children to the roote of a tree. By them all the men stood in a guard, every one having a Ba∣stinado in his hand, made of reeds bound together. This made a lane betweene them all along, through which there were appointed fiue young men to fetch these chil∣dren: so every one of the fiue went through the guard to fetch a childe each after o∣ther by turnes, the guard fiercely beating them with their Bastinadoes, and they pa∣tiently enduring and receiuing all▪ defending the children with their naked bodies from the vnmercifull blowes, that pay them soundly, though the children escape. All this while the women weepe and cry out very passionately, prouiding mats, skins, mosse, and dry wood, as things fitting their childrens funerals. After the chil∣dren were thus passed the guard, the guard tore down the trees, branches &amp; boughs, with such violence that they rent the body, and made wreaths for their heads, or be∣decked their hayre with the leaues. What els was done with the children, was not seene, but they were all cast on a heape, in a valley as dead, where th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y made a great feast for all the company.

This sacrifice they held to be so necessary, that if they should omit it, their <HI>Okee</HI> or <HI>Devill,</HI> and all their other <HI>Quiyoughcosughes,</HI> which are their other Gods, would let them haue no Deere, Turkies, Corne, nor fish, and yet besides, he would make a great slaughter amongst them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their resur∣rection.</NOTE>They thinke that their <HI>Werowances</HI> and Priests which they also esteeme <HI>Quiyough∣cosughes,</HI> when they are dead, doe goe beyond the mountaines towards the setting of the sunne, and ever remaine there in forme of their <HI>Okee,</HI> with their heads pain∣ted

<P>To divert them from this blind Idolatry, we did our best endevours, chiefly with the <HI>Werowance</HI> of <HI>Quiyoughcohanock,</HI> whose devotion, apprehension, and good dis∣position, much exceeded any in those Countries, with whom although we could not as yet prevaile, to forsake his false Gods, yet this he did beleeue that our God as much exceeded theirs, as our Gunnes did their Bowes &amp; Arrowes, and many times did send to me to <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, intreating me to pray to my God for raine, for their Gods would not send them any. And in this lamentable ignorance doe these poore soules sacrifice themselues to the Devill, not knowing their Creator; and we had not language sufficient, so plainly to expresse it as make them vnderstand it; which God grant they may.</P>

<HEAD>Of the manner of the <HI>Virginians</HI> Government.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough the Country people be very barbarous, yet haue they amongst them such government, as that their Magistrates for good commanding, and their people for due subiection, and obeying, excell many places that would be counted very civill. The forme of their Common-wealth is a Mo∣narchicall government, one as Emperour ruleth ouer many Kings or Governours. Their chiefe ruler is called <HI>Powhatan,</HI> and taketh his name of his principall place of dwelling called <HI>Powhatan.</HI> But his proper name is <HI>Wahunsonacock.</HI> Some Countries he hath which haue beene his ancestors, and came vnto him by inheritance, as the Country called <HI>Powhatan, Arrohateck, Appamatuck, Pamavnkee, Youghtanund,</HI> and <HI>Mattapanient.</HI> All the rest of his Territories expressed in the Mappe, they report haue beene his severall Conquests. In all his ancient inheritances, he hath houses built after their manner like arbours, some 30. some 40. yards long, and at every house provision for his entertainement according to the time. At <HI>Werowcomoco</HI> on the Northside of the river <HI>Pamavnkee,</HI> was his residence, when I was delivered him prisoner, some 14 myles from <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, where for the most part, he was resi∣dent, but at last he tooke so little pleasure in our neare neighbourhood, that he re∣tired himselfe to <HI>Orapakes,</HI> in the desert betwixt <HI>Chickahaman<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> and <HI>Youghtanund.</HI> He is of personage a tall well proportioned man, with a sower looke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A description of <HI>Powhatan.</HI></NOTE> his head som∣what gray, his beard so thinne, that it seemeth none at all, his age neare sixtie; of a very able and hardy body to endure any labour.

<P>A myle from <HI>Orapakes</HI> in a thicket of wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His treasury.</NOTE> he hath a house in which he keepeth his kinde of Treasure, as skinnes, copper, pearle, and beads, which he storeth vp a∣gainst the time of his death and buriall.

At the foure corners of this house stand foure

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His wiues.</NOTE>He hath as many women as he will, whereof when he lieth on his bed, one sitteth at his head, and another at his feet, but when he sitteth, one sitteth on his right hand and another on his left. As he is weary of his women, he bestoweth them on those that best deserue them at his hands. When he dineth or suppeth, one of his women before and after meat, bringeth him water in a wooden platter to wash his hands. Another waiteth with a bunch of feathers to wipe them in stead of a Towell, and the feathers when he hath wiped are dryed againe. His kingdomes descend not to his sonnes nor children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His successors</NOTE> but first to his brethren, whereof he hath 3. namely, <HI>Opit∣chapan, Opechancanough,</HI> and <HI>Catataugh,</HI> and after their decease to his sisters.

<P>He nor any of his people vnderstand any letters, whereby to write or reade, onely the lawes whereby he ruleth is custome. Yet when he listeth his will is a law and must be obeyed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their autho∣ritie.</NOTE> not onely as a King, but as halfe a God they esteeme him. His in∣feriour Kings whom they call <HI>Werowances,</HI> are tyed to rule by customes, and haue power of life and death at their command in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at nature. But this word <HI>Werowance,</HI> which we call and construe for a King, is a common word, whereby they call all commanders: for they haue but few words in their language, and but few occasions to vse any officers more then one commander, which commonly they call <HI>Werow∣ance,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The tenor of their lands.</NOTE> or <HI>Caucorouse,</HI> which is Captaine. They all know their severall lands, and ha∣bitations, and limits, to fish, soule, or hunt in, but they hold all of their great <HI>We∣rowance Powhatan,</HI> vnto whom they pay tribute of skinnes, beads, copper, pearle, deere, turkies, wild beasts, and corne. What he commandeth they dare not disobey in the least thing. It is strange to see with what great feare and adoration, all these people doe obey this <HI>Powhatan.</HI> For at his feet they present whatsoever he comman∣deth, and at the least frowne of his brow, their greatest spirits will tremble with feare: and no marvell, for he is very terrible &amp; tyrannous in punishing such as offend him. For example,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His manner of punish∣ments.</NOTE> he caused certaine malefactors to be bound hand and foot, then ha∣ving of many fires gathered great store of burning coales, they rake these coales round in the forme of a cockpit, and in the midst they cast the offenders to broyle to death. Sometimes he causeth the heads of them that offend him, to be laid vpon the altar or sacrificing stone, and one with clubbes beats out their braines. When he would punish any notorious enemy or malefactor, he causeth him to be tyed to a tree, and with Mussell shels or reeds, the executioner cutteth off his ioynts one after another, ever casting what they cut of into the fire; then doth he proceed with shels and reeds to case the skinne from his head and face; then doe they rip his belly and so burne him with the tree and all. Thus themselues reported they executed <HI>George Cassen.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 46.</NOTE> Their ordinary correction is to beate them with cudgels. We haue seene a man kneeling on his knees, and at <HI>Powhatans</HI> command, two men haue beate him on the bare skin, till he hath fallen senselesse in a sound, and yet never cry nor complai∣ned. And he made a woman for playing the whore, sit vpon a great stone, on her bare breech twenty-foure houres, onely with corne and water, every three dayes, till nine dayes were past, yet he loued her exceedingly: notwithstanding there are com∣mon whores by profession.</P>
<P>In the yeare 1608, he surprised the people of <HI>Payankatank</HI> his neare neighbours and subiects. The occasion was to vs vnknowne, but the manner was thus. First he sent divers of his men as to lodge amongst them that night, then the <HI>Ambuscadoes</HI> environed all their houses, and at the houre appointed, they all fell to the spoyle, twenty-foure men they slew, the long haire of the one side of their heads, with the skinne cased off with shels or reeds, they brought away. They surprised also the women, and the children, and the <HI>Werowance.</HI> All these they presented to <HI>Powhatan.</HI> The <HI>Werowance,</HI> women and children became his prisoners, and doe him service.
<PB N="39" REF="30"/>
The lockes of haire with their skinnes he hanged on a line betwixt two trees. And thus he made ostentation of his triumph at <HI>Werowocomoco,</HI> where he intended to haue done as much to mee and my company.</P>
<P>And this is as much as my memory can call to minde worthy of note; which I haue purposely collected, to satisfie my friends of the true worth and qualitie of <HI>Virginia.</HI> Yet some bad natures will not sticke to slander the Countrey, that will slovenly spit at all things, especially in company where they can finde none to con∣tradict them. Who though they were scarce en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r ten myles from <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, or at the most but at the falles; yet holding it a great disgrace that amongst so much action, their actions were nothing, exclaime of all things, though they never ad∣ventured to know any thing; nor euer did any thing but devoure the fruits of other mens labours. Being for most part of such tender educations, and small experience in Martiall accidents, because they found not English Cities, nor such faire houses, nor at their owne wishes any of their accustomed dainties, with feather beds and downe pillowes, Tavernes and Alehouses in every breathing place, neither such plentie of gold and silver and dissolute libertie, as they expected, had little or no care or any thing, but to pamper their bellies, to fly away with our Pinnaces, or procure their meanes to returne for <HI>England.</HI> For the Country was to them a misery, a ruine, a death, a hell, and their reports here, and their actions there according.</P>
<P>Some other there were that had yearely stipends to passe to and againe for trans∣portation: who to keepe the mysterie of the businesse in themselues, though they had neither time nor meanes to know much of themselues; yet all mens actions or relations they so formally tuned to the temporizing times simplicitie, as they could make their ignorances seeme much more, then all the true actors could by their experience. And those with their great words deluded the world with such strange promises, as abused the businesse much worse then the rest. For the busi∣nesse being builded vpon the foundation of their fained experience, the planters, the money and meanes haue still miscarried: yet they ever returning, and the planters so farre absent, who could contradict their excuses? which, still to maintaine their vaine glory and estimation, from time to time haue vsed such diligence as made them passe for truths, though nothing more false. And that the adventurers might be thus abused, let no man wonder; for the wisest liuing is soonest abused by him that hath a faire tongue and a dissembling heart.</P>
<P>There were many in <HI>Virginia</HI> meerely proiecting, verball, and idle contemplators, and those so devoted to pure idlenesse, that though they had liued two or three yeares in <HI>Virginia,</HI> lordly, necessitie it selfe could not compell them to passe the <HI>Pen∣insula,</HI> or <HI>Pallisadoes</HI> of <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, and those witty spirits, what would they not affirme in the behalfe of our transporters, to get victuall from their ships, or obtaine their good words in <HI>England,</HI> to get their passes. Thus from the clamors, and the ignorance of false informers, are sprung those disasters that sprung in <HI>Virginia</HI>: and our ingenious verbalists were no lesse plague to vs in <HI>Virginia,</HI> then the Locusts to the Egyptians. For the labour of twentie or thirtie of the best onely preserved in Christianitie by their industry, the idle livers of neare two hundred of the rest: who liuing neere ten moneths of such naturall meanes, as the Country naturally of it selfe afforded, notwithstanding all this, and the worst fury of the Salvages, the extremitie of sicknesse, mutinies, faction, ignorances, and want of victuall; in all that time I lost but seaven or eight men, yet subiected the salvages to our desired obedience, and receiued contribution from thirtie fiue of their Kings, to protect and assist them against any that should assault them, in which order they continued true and faithfull, and as subiects to his Maiestie, so long after as I did governe there, vntill I left the Countrey: since, how they haue revolted, the Countrie lost, and a∣gaine replanted, and the businesses hath succeded from time to time, I referre you to the relations of them returned from <HI>Virginia,</HI> that haue beene more diligent in such Observations.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1606"/><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T might well be thought, <NOTE PLACE="marg"> S<SUP>ir</SUP> <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> Trea∣surer.</NOTE> a Countrie so faire (as <HI>Virgi∣nia</HI> is) and a people so tractable, would long ere this haue beene quietly possessed, to the satisfaction of the adventurers, &amp; the eternizing of the memory of those that effected it. But because all the world doe see a defailement; this following Treatise shall giue satisfa∣ction to all indifferent Readers, how the businesse hath bin carried: where no doubt they will easily vnderstand and answer to their question, how it came to passe there was no better speed and successe in those proceedings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first mo∣ver of the action,</NOTE></P>
<P>Captaine <HI>Bartholomew Gosnoll,</HI> one of the first movers of this plantation, having many yeares solicited many of his friends, but found small assistants; at last prevai∣led with some Gentlemen, as Captaine <HI>Iohn Smith,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward-maria Wingfield,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Hunt,</HI> and divers others, who depended a yeare vpon his proiects, but nothing could be effected, till by their great charge and industrie, it came to be ap∣prehended by certaine of the Nobilitie, Gentry, and Marchants, so that his Maiestie by his letters patents, gaue commission for establishing Councels, to direct here; and to governe, and to execute there. To effect this, was spent another yeare, and by that, three ships were provided, one of 100 Tuns, another of 40. and a Pinnace of 20. The transportation of the company was committed to Captaine <HI>Christopher New∣port,</HI> a Marriner well practised for the Westerne parts of <HI>America.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orders for government.</NOTE> But their orders for government were put in a box, not to be opened, nor the governours knowne vntill they arrived in <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>On the 19 of December, 1606. we set sayle from Blackwall, but by vnprosperous winds, were kept six weekes in the sight of <HI>England</HI>; all which time, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hunt</HI> our Preacher, was so weake and sicke, that few expected his recovery. Yet although he were but twentie myles from his habitation (the time we were in the Downes) and notwithstanding the stormy weather, nor the scandalous imputations (of some few, little better then Atheists, of the greatest ranke amongst vs) suggested against him, all this could never force from him so much as a seeming desire to leaue the busines, but preferred the service of God, in so good a voyage, before any affection to con∣test with his godlesse foes, whose disasterous designes (could they haue prevailed)
<PB N="42" REF="34"/>
had even then overthrowne the businesse, so many discontents did then arise, had he not with the water of patience, and his godly exhortations (but chiefly by his true devoted examples) quenched those flames of envie, and dissention.</P>
<P>We watered at the Canaries, we traded with the Salvages at <HI>Dominica</HI>; three weekes we spent in refreshing our selues amongst these west-India Isles; in <HI>Gwardalupa</HI> we found a bath so hot, as in it we boyled Porck as well as over the fire. And at a little Isle called <HI>Monica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monica</HI> an vn∣frequented Isle full of Birds.</NOTE> we tooke from the bushes with our hands, neare two hogsh-heads full of Birds in three or foure houres. In <HI>Mevis, Mona,</HI> and the Virgin Isles, we spent some time, where, with a lothsome beast like a Crocodil, called a Gwayn, Tortoises, Pellicans, Parrots, and fishes, we daily feasted. Gone from thence in search of <HI>Virginia,</HI> the company was not a little discomforted, seeing the Marriners had 3 dayes passed their reckoning and found no land, so that Captaine <HI>Ratliffe</HI> (Cap∣taine of the Pinnace) rather desired to beare vp the helme to returne for <HI>England,</HI> then make further search. But God the guider of all good actions, forcing them by an extreame storme to hull all night, did driue them by his providence to their desi∣red Port, beyond all their expectations, for never any of them had seene that coast. The first land they made they called <HI>Cape Henry</HI>; where thirtie of them recreating themselues on shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their first landing.</NOTE> were assaulted by fiue Salvages, who hurt two of the English very dangerously. That night was the box opened, and the orders read, in which <HI>Bartholomew Gosnoll, Iohn Smith, Edward Wingfield, Christopher Newport, Iohn Rat∣liffe, Iohn Martin,</HI> and <HI>George Kendall,</HI> were named to be the Councell, and to choose a President amongst them for a yeare, who with the Councell should governe. Mat∣ters of moment were to be examined by a Iury, but determined by the maior part of the Councell, in which the President had two voyces. Vntill the 13 of May they sought a place to plant in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matters of government.</NOTE> then the Councell was sworne, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Wingfield</HI> was chosen President, and an Oration made, why Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> was not admitted of the Coun∣cell as the rest.</P>
<P>Now falleth every man to worke, the Councell contriue the Fort, the rest cut downe trees to make place to pitch their Tents; some provide clapbord to relade the ships, some make gardens, some nets, &amp;c. The Salvages often visited vs kindly. The Presidents overweening iealousie would admit no exercise at armes, or fortifi∣cation, but the boughs of trees cast together in the forme of a halfe moone by the extraordinary paines and diligence of Captaine <HI>Kendall. Newport, Smith,</HI> and twen∣tie others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The discove∣ry of the <HI>Falles</HI> &amp; <HI>Powhatan.</HI></NOTE> were sent to discover the head of the river: by divers small habitations they passed, in six dayes they arrived at a Towne called <HI>Powhatan,</HI> consisting of some twelue houses, pleasantly seated on a hill; before it three fertile Isles, about it many of their cornefields, the place is very pleasant, and strong by nature, of this place the Prince is called <HI>Powhatan,</HI> and his people <HI>Powhatans,</HI> to this place the river is naviga∣ble: but higher within a myle, by reason of the Rockes and Isles, there is not pas∣sage for a small Boat, this they call the Falles, the people in all parts kindly intrea∣ted them, till being returned within twentie myles of <HI>Iames</HI> towne, they gaue iust cause of iealousie, but had God not blessed the discoverers otherwise then those at the Fort, there had then beene an end of that plantation; for at the Fort, where they arrived the next day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort as∣saulted by the Salvages.</NOTE> they found 17 men hurt, and a boy slaine by the Salvages, and had it not chanced a crosse barre shot from the Ships strooke downe a bough from a tree amongst them, that caused them to retire, our men had all beene slaine, being securely all at worke, and their armes in dry fats.</P>
<P>Herevpon the President was contented the Fort should be pallisadoed, the Ord∣nance mounted, his men armed and exercised, for many were the assaults, and am∣buscadoes of the Salvages, &amp; our men by their disorderly stragling were often hurt, when the Salvages by the nimblenesse of their heeles well escaped. What toyle we had, with so small a power to guard our workemen adayes, watch all night, resist our enemies, and effect our businesse, to relade the ships, cut downe trees, and pre∣pare the ground to plant our Corne, &amp;c, I referre to the Readers consideration. Six weekes being spent in this manner, Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> (who was hired onely for
<PB N="43" REF="34"/>
our transportation) was to returne with the ships. Now Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> who all this time from their departure from the Canaries was restrained as a prisoner vpon the scandalous suggestions of some of the chiefe (envying his repute) who fained he in∣tended to vsurpe the government, murther the Councell, and make himselfe King, that his confederats were dispersed in all the three ships, and that divers of his con∣federats that revealed it, would affirme it, for this he was committed as a prisoner: thirteene weekes he remained thus suspected, and by that time the ships should re∣turne they pretended out of their commisserations, to referre him to the Councell in <HI>England</HI> to receiue a check, rather then by particulating his designes make him so odious to the world, as to touch his life, or vtterly overthrow his reputation. But he so much scorned their charitie, and publikely defied the vttermost of their cruel∣tie, he wisely prevented their policies, though he could not suppresse their envies, yet so well he demeaned himselfe in this businesse, as all the company did see his innocency, and his adversaries malice, and those suborned to accuse him, accused his accusers of subornation; many vntruthes were alledged against him; but being so apparently disproved, begat a generall hatred in the hearts of the company against such vniust Commanders, that the President was adiudged to giue him 200<SUP>l</SUP>. so that all he had was seized vpon, in part of satisfaction, which <HI>Smith</HI> presently returned to the Store for the generall vse of the <HI>Colony.</HI> Many were the mischiefes that daily sprung from their ignorant (yet ambitious) spirits; but the good Doctrine and exhortation of our Preacher M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hunt</HI> reconciled them, and caused Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> to be admitted of the Councell; the next day all receiued the Communion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain <HI>New∣ports</HI> returne for <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> the day following the Salvages voluntarily desired peace, and Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> returned for <HI>England</HI> with newes; leaving in <HI>Virginia</HI> 100. the 15 of Iune 1607.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>What happened till the first supply.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The occasion of sicknesse.</NOTE>BEing thus left to our fortunes, it fortuned that within ten dayes scarce ten a∣mongst vs could either goe, or well stand, such extreame weaknes and sicknes oppressed vs. And thereat none need marvaile, if they consider the cause and reason, which was this; whilest the ships stayed, our allowance was some∣what bettered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sailers abuses.</NOTE> by a daily proportion of Bisket, which the sailers would pilfer to sell, giue, or exchange with vs, for money, Saxefras, furres, or loue. But when they de∣parted, there remained neither taverne, beere▪house, nor place of reliefe, but the common Kettell. Had we beene as free from all sinnes as gluttony, and drunken∣nesse, we might haue beene canonized for Saints; But our President would never haue beene admitted, for ingrossing to his private, Oatmeale, Sacke, Oyle, <HI>Aqua∣vitae,</HI> Beefe, Egges, or what not, but the Kettell; that indeed he allowed equally to be distributed, and that was halfe a pint of wheat, and as much barley boyled with water for a man a day, and this having fryed some 26. weekes in the ships hold, con∣tained as many wormes as graines; so that we might truely call it rather so much bran then corne, our drinke was water, our lodgings Castles in the ayre: with this lodging and dyet, our extreame toile in bearing and planting Pallisadoes, so strained and bruised vs, and our continuall labour in the extremitie of the heat had so weak∣ned vs, as were cause sufficient to haue made vs as miserable in our natiue Countrey, or any other place in the world. From May, to September, those that escaped, liued vpon Sturgeon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bad Presi∣dent.</NOTE> and Sea-crabs, fiftie in this time we buried, the rest seeing the Presi∣dents proiects to escape these miseries in our Pinnace by flight (who all this time had neither felt want nor sicknes) so moved our dead spirits, as we deposed him; and established <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> in his place, (<HI>Gosnoll</HI> being dead) <HI>Kendall</HI> deposed, <HI>Smith</HI> newly recovered, <HI>Martin</HI> and <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> was by his care preserved and relieued, and the most of the souldiers recovered, with the skilfull diligence of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Wotton</HI> our Chirurgian generall. But now was all our provision spent, the Sturgeon gone, all helps abandoned, each houre expecting the fury of the Salvages; when God the patron of all good indevours, in that desperate extremitie so changed the hearts of the Salvages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plentie vnex∣pected.</NOTE> that they brought such plenty of their fruits, and provision, as no man wanted.</P>
<P>And now where some affirmed it was ill done of the Councell to send forth men so badly provided, this incontradictable reason will shew them plainely they are too ill advised to nourish such ill conceits; first, the fault of our going was our owne,
<PB N="45" REF="35"/>
what could be thought fitting or necessary we had, but what we should find, or want, or where we should be, we were all ignorant, and supposing to make our passage in two moneths, with victuall to liue, and the advantage of the spring to worke; we were at Sea fiue moneths, where we both spent our victuall and lost the opportuni∣tie of the time, and season to plant, by the vnskilfull presumption of our ignorant transporters, that vnderstood not at all, what they vndertooke.</P>
<P>Such actions haue ever since the worlds beginning beene subiect to such acci∣dents, and every thing of worth is found full of difficulties, but nothing so difficult as to establish a Common-wealth so farre remote from men and meanes, and where mens mindes are so vntoward as neither doe well themselues, nor suffer others. But to proceed.</P>
<P>The new President and <HI>Martin,</HI> being little beloved, of weake iudgement in dangers, and lesse industrie in peace, committed the managing of all things abroad to Captaine <HI>Smith</HI>: who by his owne example, good words, and faire promises, set some to mow, others to binde thatch, some to build houses, others to thatch them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The building of <HI>Iames Towne.</HI></NOTE> himselfe alwayes bearing the greatest taske for his owne share, so that in short time, he provided most of them lodgings, neglecting any for himselfe. This done, seeing the Salvages superfluitie beginne to decrease (with some of his workemen) shipped himselfe in the Shallop to search the Country for trade. The want of the language, knowledge to mannage his boat without sailes, the want of a sufficient power, (knowing the multitude of the Salvages) apparell for his men, and other necessa∣ries, were infinite impediments, yet no discouragement. Being but six or seauen in company he went downe the river to <HI>Kecoughtan,</HI> where at first they scorned him, as a famished man, and would in derision offer him a handfull of Corne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The begin∣ning of Trade abroad.</NOTE> a peece of bread, for their swords and muskets, and such like proportions also for their appa∣rell. But seeing by trade and courtesie there was nothing to be had, he made bold to try such conclusions as necessitie inforced, though contrary to his Commission: Let fly his muskets, ran his boat on shore, whereat they all fled into the woods. So marching towards their houses, they might see great heapes of corne: much adoe he had to restraine his hungry souldiers from present taking of it, expecting as it hap∣ned that the Salvages would assault them, as not long after they did with a most hy∣deous noyse. Sixtie or seaventie of them, some blacke, some red, some white, some party-coloured, came in a square order, singing and dauncing out of the woods, with their <HI>Okee</HI> (which was an Idoll made of skinnes, stuffed with mosse, all painted and hung with chaines and copper) borne before them: and in this manner being well armed, with Clubs, Targets, Bowes and Arrowes, they charged the English, that so kindly receiued them with their muskets loaden with Pistoll shot, that downe fell their God, and divers lay sprauling on the ground; the rest fled againe to the woods, and ere long sent one of their <HI>Quiyoughkasoucks</HI> to offer peace, and redeeme their <HI>Okee. Smith</HI> told them, if onely six of them would come vnarmed and loade his boat, he would not only be their friend, but restore them their <HI>Okee,</HI> and giue them Beads, Copper, and Hatchets besides: which on both sides was to their contents performed: and then they brought him Venison, Turkies, wild-foule, bread, and what they had, singing and dauncing in signe of friendship till they departed. In his returne he discovered the Towne and Country of <HI>Warraskoyack.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Thus God vnboundlesse by his power,</L>
<L>Made them thus kind, would vs deuour.</L>
</LG>
<P><HI>Smith</HI> perceiving (notwithstanding their late miserie) not any regarded but from hand to mouth (the company being well recovered) caused the Pinnace to be provi∣ded with things fitting to get provision for the yeare following;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Amoris,</HI> a Sal∣vage his best friend slaine for loving vs.</NOTE> but in the interim he made 3. or 4. iournies and discovered the people of <HI>Chickahamania</HI>: yet what he carefully provided the rest carelesly spent. <HI>Wingfield</HI> and <HI>Kendall</HI> liuing in disgrace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Discove∣ry of <HI>Chicka∣hamine.</HI></NOTE> seeing all things at randome in the absence of <HI>Smith,</HI> the companies dislike of their
<PB N="46" REF="36" MS="y"/>
Presidents weaknes, and their small loue to <HI>Martins</HI> never mending sicknes, streng∣thened themselues with the sailers, and other confederates to regaine their former credit and authority, or at least such meanes abord the Pinnace, (being fitted to saile as <HI>Smith</HI> had appointed for trade) to alter her course and to goe for <HI>England. Smith</HI> vnexpectedly returning had the plot discovered to him, much trouble he had to prevent it, till with store of sakre and musket shot he forced them stay or sinke in the riuer, which action cost the life of captaine <HI>Kendall.</HI> These brawles are so disgust∣full, as some will say they were better forgotten, yet all men of good iudgement will conclude, it were better their basenes should be manifest to the world, then the busines beare the scorne and shame of their excused disorders. The President and captaine <HI>Archer</HI> not long after intended also to haue abandoned the country, which proiect also was curbed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another pro∣iect to aban∣don the coun∣try.</NOTE> and suppressed by <HI>Smith.</HI> The <HI>Spaniard</HI> never more gree∣dily desired gold then he victuall, nor his souldiers more to abandon the Country, then he to keepe it. But finding plentie of Corne in the riuer of <HI>Chickahamania</HI> where hundreds of Salvages in diuers places stood with baskets expecting his com∣ming. And now the winter approaching, the rivers became so covered with swans, geese, duckes, and cranes, that we daily feasted with good bread, Virginia pease, pumpions, and putchamins, fish, fowle, and diverse sorts of wild beasts as fat as we could eate them: so that none of our Tuftasfaty humorists desired to goe for <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> But our <HI>Comaedies</HI> never endured long without a <HI>Tragedie</HI>; some idle excepti∣ons being muttered against Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> for not discovering the head of <HI>Chic∣kahamania</HI> river, and taxed by the Councell, to be too slow in so worthy an attempt. The next voyage hee proceeded so farre that with much labour by cutting of trees in sunder he made his passage, but when his Barge could passe no farther, he left her in a broad bay out of danger of shot, commanding none should goe a shore till his returne: himselfe with two English and two Salvages went vp higher in a Canowe, but hee was not long absent, but his men went a shore, whose want of government, gaue both occasion and opportunity to the Salvages to surprise one <HI>George Cassen,</HI> whom they slew, and much failed not to haue cut of the boat and all the rest. <HI>Smith</HI> little dreaming of that accident, being got to the marshes at the rivers head, twentie myles in the desert, had his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iehu Robinson</HI> and <HI>Thomas Emry</HI> slaine.</NOTE> two men slaine (as is supposed) sleeping by the Ca∣nowe, whilst himselfe by fowling sought them victuall, who finding he was beset with 200. Salvages, two of them hee slew, still defending himselfe with the ayd of a Salvage his guid, whom he bound to his arme with his garters, and vsed him as a buckler, yet he was shot in his thigh a little, and had many arrowes that stucke in his cloathes but no great hurt, till at last they tooke him prisoner. When this newes came to <HI>Iames</HI> towne, much was their sorrow for his losse, fewe expecting what ensued. Sixe or seuen weekes those Barbarians kept him prisoner, many strange triumphes and coniurations they made of him, yet hee so demeaned himselfe a∣mongst them, as he not onely diverted them from surprising the Fort, but procu∣red his owne libertie, and got himselfe and his company such estimation amongst them, that those Salvages admired him more then their owne <HI>Quiyouckosucks.</HI> The manner how they vsed and deliuered him, is as followeth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> taken prisoner.</NOTE>The Salvages hauing drawne from <HI>George Cassen</HI> whether Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> was gone, prosecuting that oportunity they followed him with. 300. bowmen, con∣ducted by the King of <HI>Pamavnkee,</HI> who in diuisions searching the turnings of the riuer, found <HI>Robinson</HI> and <HI>Emry</HI> by the fire side, those they shot full of arrowes and slew. Then finding the Captaine▪ as is said, that vsed the Salvage that was his guide as his sheld (three of them being slaine and diuers other so gauld) all the rest would not come neere him. Thinking thus to haue returned to his boat, regarding them, as he marched, more then his way, slipped vp to the middle in an oasie creeke &amp; his Salvage with him, yet durst they not come to him till being neere dead with cold, he threw away his armes. Then according to their composition they drew him forth and led him to the fire, where his men were slaine. Diligently they chafed his be∣nummed
<PB N="47" REF="36"/>
limbs. He demanding for their Captaine, they shewed him <HI>Opechanka∣nough,</HI> King of <HI>Pamavnkee,</HI> to whom he gaue a round Ivory double compass Dyall. Much they marvailed at the playing of the Fly and Needle, which they could see so plainely, and yet not touch it, because of the glasse that covered them. But when he demonstrated by that Globe-like Iewell, the roundnesse of the earth and skies, the spheare of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, and how the Sunne did chase the night round about the world continually; the greatnesse of the Land and Sea, the diversi∣tie of Nations, varietie of complexions, and how we were to them <HI>Antipodes,</HI> and ma∣ny other such like matters, they all stood as amazed with admiration. Notwithstan∣ding, within an houre after they tyed him to a tree, and as many as could stand a∣bout him prepared to shoot him, but the King holding vp the Compass in his hand, they all laid downe their Bowes and Arrowes, and in a triumphant manner led him to <HI>Orapaks,</HI> where he was after their manner kindly feasted, and well vsed.</P>
<P>Their order in conducting him was thus; Drawing themselues all in fyle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order they observed in then tri∣vmph.</NOTE> the King in the middest had all their Peeces and Swords borne before him. Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> was led after him by three great Salvages, holding him fast by each arme: and on each side six went in fyle with their Arrowes nocked. But arriving at the Towne (which was but onely thirtie or fortie hunting houses made of Mats, which they re∣moue as they please, as we our tents) all the women and children staring to behold him, the souldiers nrst all in fyle performed the forme of a <HI>Bissom</HI> so well as could be; and on each flanke, officers as Serieants to see them keepe their orders. A good time they continued this exercise, and then cast themselues in a ring, dauncing in such severall Postures, and singing and yelling out such hellish notes and screeches; be∣ing strangely painted, every one his quiver of Arrowes, and at his backe a club; on his arme a Fox or an Otters skinne, or some such matter for his vambrace; their heads and shoulders painted red, with Oyle and <HI>Pocones</HI> mingled together, which Scarlet-like colour made an exceeding handsome shew; his Bow in his hand, and the skinne of a Bird with her wings abroad dryed, tyed on his head, a peece of cop∣per, a white shell, a long feather, with a small rattle growing at the tayles of their snaks tyed to it, or some such like toy. All this while <HI>Smith</HI> and the King stood in the middest guarded, as before is said, and after three dances they all departed. <HI>Smith</HI> they conducted to a long house, where thirtie or fortie tall fellowes did guard him, and ere long more bread and venison was brought him then would haue served twentie men, I thinke his stomacke at that time was not very good; what he left they put in baskets and tyed over his head. About midnight they set the meate a∣gaine before him, all this time not one of them would eate a bit with him, till the next morning they brought him as much more, and then did they eate all the old, &amp; reserved the new as they had done the other, which made him thinke they would fat him to eat him. Yet in this desperate estate to defend him from the cold, one <HI>Mao∣cassater</HI> brought him his gowne, in requitall of some beads and toyes <HI>Smith</HI> had gi∣ven him at his first arrivall in <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>Two dayes after a man would haue slaine him (but that the guard prevented it) for the death of his sonne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How he should haue beene slaine at <HI>Orapacks.</HI></NOTE>to whom they conducted him to recover the poore man then breathing his last. <HI>Smith</HI> told them that at <HI>Iames</HI> towne he had a water would doe it, if they would let him fetch it, but they would not permit that; but made all the preparations they could to assault <HI>Iames</HI> towne, crauing his advice, and for re∣compence he should haue life, libertie, land, and women. In part of a Table booke he writ his minde to them at the Fort, what was intended, how they should follow that direction to affright the messengers, and without fayle send him such things as he writ for. And an Inventory with them. The difficultie and danger, he told the Salvages, of the Mines, great gunnes, and other Engins exceedingly affrighted them, yet according to his request they went to <HI>Iames</HI> towne, in as bitter weather as could be of fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and snow, and within three dayes returned with an answer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How he saued <HI>Iames</HI> towne from <HI>being surprised.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>But when they came to <HI>Iame</HI> towne, seeing men sally out as he had told them they would, they fled; yet in the night they came againe to the same place where he had
<PB N="48" REF="37"/>
told them they should receiue an answer, and such things as he had promised them, which they found accordingly, and with which they returned with no small expe∣dition, to the wonder of them all that heard it, that he could either divine, or the paper could speake: then they led him to the <HI>Youthtanunds,</HI> the <HI>Mattapanicuts,</HI> the <HI>Payankatanks,</HI> the <HI>Nantaughtacunds,</HI> and <HI>Onawmanients</HI> vpon the rivers of <HI>Rapaha∣nock,</HI> and <HI>Patawomek,</HI> over all those rivers, and backe againe by divers other severall Nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they did Coniure him at <HI>Pamavnkee.</HI></NOTE> to the Kings habitation at <HI>Pamavnkee,</HI> where they entertained him with most strange and fearefull Coniurations;</P>
<LG>
<L>As if neare led to hell,</L>
<L>Amongst the Devils to dwell.</L>
</LG>
<P>Not long after, early in a morning a great fire was made in a long house, and a mat spread on the one side, as on the other, on the one they caused him to sit, and all the guard went out of the house, and presently came skipping in a great grim fellow, all painted over with coale, mingled with oyle; and many Snakes and Wesels skins stuffed with mosse, and all their tayles tyed together, so as they met on the crowne of his head in a tassell; and round about the tassell was as a Coronet of fea∣thers, the skins hanging round about his head, backe, and shoulders, and in a man∣ner covered his face; with a hellish voyce and a rattle in his hand. With most strange gestures and passions he began his invocation, and environed the fire with a circle of meale; which done, three more such like devils came rushing in with the like an∣tique tricks, painted halfe blacke, halfe red: but all their eyes were painted white, and some red stroakes like Mutchato's, along their cheekes: round about him those fiends daunced a pretty while, and then came in three more as vgly as the rest; with red eyes, and white stroakes over their blacke faces, at last they all sat downe right against him; three of them on the one hand of the chiefe Priest, and three on the other. Then all with their rattles began a song, which ended, the chiefe Priest layd downe fiue wheat cornes: then strayning his armes and hands with such vio∣lence that he sweat, and his veynes swelled, he began a short Oration: at the conclu∣sion they all gaue a short groane; and then layd down three graines more. After that, began their song againe, and then another Oration, ever laying downe so many cornes as before, till they had twice incirculed the fire; that done, they tooke a bunch of little stickes prepared for that purpose, continuing still their devotion, and at the end of every song and Oration, they layd downe a slicke betwixt the divisions of Corne. Till night, neither he nor they did either eate or drinke, and then they fea∣sted merrily, with the best provisions they could make. Three dayes they vsed this Ceremony; the meaning whereof they told him, was to know if he intended them well or no. The circle of meale signified their Country, the circles of corne the bounds of the Sea, and the stickes his Country. They imagined the world to be flat and round, like a trencher, and they in the middest. After this they brought him a bagge of gunpowder, which they carefully preserved till the next spring, to plant as they did their corne; because they would be acquainted with the nature of that seede. <HI>Opitchapam</HI> the Kings brother invited him to his house, where, with as many platters of bread, soule, and wild beasts, as did environ him, he bid him well∣come; but not any of them would eate a bit with him, but put vp all the remainder in Baskets. At his returne to <HI>Opechancanoughs,</HI> all the Kings women, and their chil∣dren, flocked about him for their parts, as a due by Custome, to be merry with such fragments.</P>
<LG>
<L>But his waking mind in hydeous dreames did oft see wondrous shapes,</L>
<L>Of bodies strange, and huge in growth, and of stupendious makes.</L>
</LG>
<P>At last they brought him to <HI>Meronocomoco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How <HI>Powha∣tan</HI> entertai∣ned him.</NOTE> where was <HI>Powhatan</HI> their Emperor. Here more then two hundred of those grim Courtiers stood wondering at him, as he had beene a monster; till <HI>Powhatan</HI> and his trayne had put themselues in their greatest braveries. Before a fire vpon a seat like a bedsted, he sat covered with a great robe, made of <HI>Rarowcun</HI> skinnes, and all the tayles hanging by. On either hand did sit a young wench of 16 or 18 yeares, and along on each side the house, two rowes
<PB N="49" REF="37"/>
of men, and behind them as many women, with all their heads and shoulders pain∣ted red; many of their heads bedecked with the white downe of Birds; but every one with something: and a great chayne of white beads about their necks. At his entrance before the King, all the people gaue a great shout. The Queene of <HI>Appa∣matuck</HI> was appointed to bring him water to wash his hands, and another brought him a bunch of feathers, in stead of a Towell to dry them: having feasted him after their best barbarous manner they could, a long consultation was held, but the con∣clusion was, two great stones were brought before <HI>Powhatan</HI>: then as many as could layd hands on him, dragged him to them, and thereon laid his head, and being ready with their clubs, to beate out his braines, <HI>Pocahontas</HI> the Kings dearest daughter, when no intreaty could prevaile, got his head in her armes, and laid her owne vp∣on his to saue him from death: whereat the Emperour was contented he should liue to make him hatchets, and her bells, beads, and copper;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How <HI>Poca∣hontas</HI> saved his life.</NOTE> for they thought him aswell of all occupations as themselues. For the King himselfe will make his owne robes, shooes, bowes, arrowes, pots; plant, hunt, or doe any thing so well as the rest.</P>
<LG>
<L>They say he bore a pleasant shew,</L>
<L>But sure his heart was sad.</L>
<L>For who can pleasant be, and rest,</L>
<L>That liues in feare and dread:</L>
<L>And having life suspected, doth</L>
<L>It still suspected lead.</L>
</LG>
<P>Two dayes after, <HI>Powhatan</HI> having disguised himselfe in the most fearefullest man∣ner he could, caused Cap<SUP>t</SUP>: <HI>Smith</HI> to be brought forth to a great house in the woods, and there vpon a mat by the fire to be left alone. Not long after from behinde a mat that divided the house, was made the most dolefullest noyse he ever heard; then <HI>Powhatan</HI> more like a devill then a man with some two hundred more as blacke as himselfe, came vnto him and told him now they were friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How <HI>Pow∣hatan</HI> sent him to <HI>Iames</HI> Towne.</NOTE> and presently he should goe to <HI>Iames</HI> towne, to send him two great gunnes, and a gryndstone, for which he would giue him the Country of <HI>Capahowosick,</HI> and for ever esteeme him as his sonne <HI>Nantaquoud.</HI> So to <HI>Iames</HI> towne with 12 guides <HI>Powhatan</HI> sent him. That night they quarterd in the woods, he still expecting (as he had done all this long time of his imprisonment) every houre to be put to one death or other: for all their feasting. But almightie God (by his divine providence) had mollified the hearts of those sterne <HI>Barbarians</HI> with compassion. The next morning betimes they came to the Fort, where <HI>Smith</HI> having vsed the Salvages with what kindnesse he could, he shewed <HI>Rawhunt, Powhatans</HI> trusty servant two demi-Culverings &amp; a mill∣stone to carry <HI>Powhatan</HI>: they found them somewhat too heavie; but when they did see him discharge them, being loaded with stones, among the boughs of a great tree loaded with Isickles, the yee and branches came so tumbling downe, that the poore Salvages ran away halfe dead with feare. But at last we regained some conference with them, and gaue them such toyes; and sent to <HI>Powhatan,</HI> his women, and chil∣dren such presents, as gaue them in generall full content. Now in <HI>Iames</HI> Towne they were all in combustion, the strongest preparing once more to run away with the Pinnace; which with the hazzard of his life, with Sakre falcon and musket shot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third proiect to abandon the Countrey.</NOTE> <HI>Smith</HI> forced now the third time to stay or sinke. Some no better then they should be, had plotted with the President, the next day to haue▪ put him to death by the Le∣viticall law, for the liues of <HI>Robinson</HI> and <HI>Emry,</HI> pretending the fault was his that had led them to their ends: but he quickly tooke such order with such Lawyers, that he layd them by the heeles till he sent some of them prisoners for <HI>England.</HI> Now ever once in foure or fiue dayes, <HI>Pocahontas</HI> with her attendants, brought him so much provision, that saved many of their liues, that els for all this had starved with hun∣ger.</P>
<LG>
<L>Thus from numbe death our good God sent reliefe,</L>

Thus you may see what difficulties still crossed any good indevour: and the good successe of the businesse being thus oft brought to the very period of destruction; yet you see by what strange means God hath still delivered it. As for the insufficien∣cy of them admitted in Commission, that error could not be prevented by the Elec∣tors; there being no other choise; and all strangers to each others education, quali∣ties, or disposition. And if any deeme it a shame to our Nation to haue any mention made of those inormities, let them pervse the Histories of the Spanyards Discoveries and Plantations, where they may see how many mutinies, disorders, and dissentions haue accompanied them, and crossed their attempts: which being knowne to be particular mens offences; doth take away the generall scorne and contempt, which malice, presumption, covetousnesse, or ignorance might produce; to the scandall and reproach of those, whose actions and valiant resolutions deserue a more wor∣thy respect.</P>
<P>Now whether it had beene better for Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> to haue concluded with a∣ny of those severall proiects, to haue abandoned the Countrey, with some ten or twelue of them, who were called the better sort, and haue left M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hunt</HI> our Preacher, Master <HI>Anthony Gosnoll,</HI> a most honest, worthy, and industrious Gentleman, Master <HI>Thomas Wotton,</HI> and some 27 others of his Countrymen to the fury of the Salvages, famine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of two evils the lesse was chosen.</NOTE> and all manner of mischiefes, and inconveniences, (for they were but fortie in all to keepe possession of this large Country;) or starue himselfe with them for company, for want of lodging: or but adventuring abroad to make them provision, or by his opposition to preserue the action, and saue all their liues; I leaue to the censure of all honest men to consider.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The Arrivall of the first supply, with their Proceedings, and the Ships returne.</HEAD>
<P>ALL this time our care was not so much to abandon the Countrey; but the Treasurer and Councell in <HI>England,</HI> were as diligent &amp; carefull to supply vs. Two good ships they sent vs, with neare a hundred men, well furnished with all things could be imagined necessary, both for them and vs; The one commanded by Captaine <HI>Newport</HI>: the other by Captaine <HI>Francis Nelson,</HI> an honest man, and an expert Marriner. But such was the lewardnesse of his Ship (that though he was within the sight of <HI>Cape Henry</HI>) by stormy contrary winds was he forced so farre to Sea, that the West <HI>Indies</HI> was the next land, for the repaire of his Masts, and reliefe of wood and water.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Phoenix</HI> from Cape <HI>Henry</HI> forced to the West <HI>Indies.</HI></NOTE> But <HI>Newport</HI> got in and arrived at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, not long after the redemption of Captaine <HI>Smith.</HI> To whom the Salvages, as is sayd, every other day repaired, with such provisions that sufficiently did serue them from hand to mouth: part alwayes they brought him as Presents from their Kings, or <HI>Pocahontas</HI>; the rest he as their Market Clarke set the price himselfe, how they should sell: so he

had inchanted these poore soules being their prisoner; and now <HI>Newport,</HI> whom he called his Father arriving, neare as directly as he foretold, they esteemed him as an Oracle, and had them at that submission he might command them what he listed. That God that created all things they knew he adored for his God: they would also in their discourses tearme the God of Captaine <HI>Smith.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Thus the Almightie was the bringer on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their opini∣on of our God.</NOTE></L>
<L>The guide, path, terme, all which was God alone.</L>
</LG>
<P>But the President and Councell so much envied his estimation among the Sal∣vages, (though we all in generall equally participated with him of the good there∣of,) that they wrought it into the Salvages vnderstandings (by their great bounty in giving foure times more for their commodities then <HI>Smith</HI> appointed) that their greatnesse and authoritie as much exceeded his, as their bountie and liberalitie. Now the arrivall of this first supply so overioyed vs, that wee could not devise too much to please the Marriners. We gaue them libertie to trucke or trade at their plea∣sures. But in a short time it followed, that could not be had for a pound of Cop∣per, which before was sould vs for an ounce: thus ambition and sufferance cut the throat of our trade, but confirmed their opinion of the greatnesse of Cap<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>New∣port,</HI> (wherewith <HI>Smith</HI> had possessed <HI>Powhatan</HI>) especially by the great presents <HI>Newport</HI> often sent him, before he could prepare the Pinnace to goe and visti him: so that this great Savage desired also to see him. A great coyle there was to set him forward. When he went he was accompanied with Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> &amp; M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Scrivener,</HI> a very wise vnderstanding Gentleman, newly arrived and admitted of the Councell, with thirtie or fortie choisen men for their guard.

Which caused <HI>Smith</HI> to make diverse Salvages goe over first, keeping some of the chiefe as hostage till halfe his men were passed, to make a guard for himselfe and the rest. But finding all things well, by two or three hundred Salvages they were kindly conducted to their towne. Where <HI>Powhatan</HI> strained himselfe to the vtmost of his greatnesse to enter∣taine them, with great shouts of ioy, Orations of protestations; and with the most plenty of victualls he could provide to feast them. Sitting vpon his bed of mats, his pillow of leather imbrodered (after their rude manner with pearle and white Beads) his attyre a faire robe of skinnes as large as an Irish mantell: at his head and feete a handsome young woman: on each side his house sat twentie of his Concu∣bines, their heads and shoulders painted red, with a great chaine of white beads a∣bout each of their neckes.

their old acquaintance, this great King and our Captaine spent the time, till the ebbe left our Barge aground. Then renewing their feasts with feares, dauncing and singing, and such like nurth, we quartered that night with <HI>Powhatan.</HI> The next day <HI>Newport</HI> came a shore and receiued as much content as those people could giue him: a boy named <HI>Thomas Salvage</HI> was then giuen vnto <HI>Powhatan,</HI> whom <HI>Newport</HI> called his sonne;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The exchāge of a Christian for a Salvage.</NOTE> for whom <HI>Powhatan</HI> gaue him <HI>Namontack</HI> his trustie servant, and one of a shrewd, subtill capacitie.

<P><HI>Powhatan</HI> (to expresse his loue to <HI>Newport</HI>) when he departed, presented him with twentie Turkies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An ill exam∣ple to sell swords to Salvages.</NOTE> conditionally to returne him twentie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>words, which immediately was sent him; now after his departure he presented Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> with the like luggage, but not finding his humor obeyed in not sending such weapons as he de∣sired, he caused his people with twentie devices to obtaine them.

But to try their furies he sallied out amongst them, and in lesse then an houre, he so hampred their insolencies, they brought them his two men, desiring peace without any further composition for their prisoners. Those he examined, and caused them all beleeue, by severall vollies of shot one of their companions was shot to death, because they would not confesse their intents and plotters of those villanies. And thus they all agreed in one point, they were directed onely by <HI>Powhatan</HI> to ob∣taine him our weapons, to cut our owne throats, with the manner where, how, and when,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Powhatans</HI> excuse.</NOTE> which we plainly found most true and apparant: yet he sent his messengers, and his dearest daughter <HI>Pocahontas</HI> with presents to excuse him of the iniuries done by some rash vntoward Captaines his subiects, desiring their liberties for this time, with the assurance of his loue for ever. After <HI>Smith</HI> had given the prisoners what correction he thought fit, vsed them well a day or two after, &amp; then delivered them <HI>Pocahontas,</HI> for whose sake onely he fayned to haue saued their liues, and gaue them libertie.

This as a miracle drew many to behold them, all which being a great part of his people, not long after dyed, and but few escaped. They spake the lan∣guage of <HI>Powhatan,</HI> wherein they made such descriptions of the Bay, Isles, and rivers, that often did vs exceeding pleasure. Passing along the coast, searching every inlet, and Bay, fit for harbours and habitations. Seeing many Isles in the midst of the Bay we bore vp for them, but ere we could obtaine them, such an extreame gust of wind, rayne, thunder, and lightening happened, that with great danger we escaped the vnmercifull raging of that Ocean-like water. The highest land on the mayne, yet it was but low,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Russels</HI> Isles.</NOTE> we called <HI>Keales</HI> hill, and these vninhabited Isles, <HI>Russels</HI> Isles. The next day searching them for fresh water, we could find none, the defect whereof for∣ced vs to follow the next Easterne Channell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wighcocomoco.</NOTE> which brought vs to the river of <HI>Wigh∣cocomoco.</HI> The people at first with great fury seemed to assault vs, yet at last with songs and daunces and much mirth became very tractable, but searching their habitations for water, we could fill but three barricoes, &amp; that such puddle, that never till then we ever knew the want of good water. We digged and searched in many places, but before two daies were expired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An extreame want of fresh water.</NOTE> we would haue refused two barricoes of gold for one of that puddle water of <HI>Wighcocomoco.</HI> Being past these Isles which are many in num∣ber, but all naught for habitation, falling with a high land vpon the mayne, we found a great Pond of fresh water, but so exceeding hot wee supposed it some bath; that place we called poynt <HI>Ployer,</HI> in honor of that most honourable House of <HI>Mousay</HI> in <HI>Britaine,</HI> that in an extreame extremitie once relieued our Captaine. From <HI>Wigh∣cocomoco</HI> to this place, all the coast is low broken Isles of Morap, growne a myle or two in breadth, and ten or twelue in length, good to cut for hay in Summer, and to catch fish and foule in Winter: but the Land beyond them is all covered over with wood, as is the rest of the Country.</P>
<P>Being thus refreshed in crossing ouer from the maine to other Isles, we discouered the winde and waters so much increased with thunder, lightning, and raine, that our mast and sayle blew ouerbord and such mighty waues ouerracked vs in that small barge that with great labour we kept her frō sinking by freeing out the water.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Barge neare sunke in a gust.</NOTE> Two dayes we were inforced to inhabite these vninhabited Isles which for the extremitie of gusts, thunder, raine, stormes, and ill wether we called <HI>Limbo.</HI> Repairing our saile with our shirts, we set sayle for the maine and fell with a pretty convenient riuer on the East called <HI>Cuskarawaok,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuskarawaock.</NOTE> the people ran as amazed in troups from place to place, and diuers got into the tops of trees, they were not sparing of their arrowes, nor the greatest passion they could expresse of their anger. Long they shot, we still ryding at an Anchor without there reatch making all the signes of friendship we could. The next day they came vnarmed, with euery one a basket, dancing in a ring, to draw vs on shore: but seeing there was nothing in them but villany, we discharged a volly of muskets charged with pistoll shot, whereat they all lay tumbling on the grownd, creeping some one way, some another into a great cluster of reedes hard by; where there companies lay in Ambuscado. Towards the euening we wayed, &amp; approaching the shoare, discharging fiue or six shot among the reedes, we landed where there lay a many of baskets and much bloud, but saw not a Salvage. A smoake appearing on the other side the riuer, we rowed thither, where we found two or three little houses, in each a fire, there we left some peeces of copper, beads, bells, and looking glasses, and then went into the bay, but when it was darke we came backe againe.

We passed many shallow creekes, but the first we found Nauigable for a ship, we called <HI>Bolus,</HI> for that the clay in many places vnder the clifts by the high water marke, did grow vp in red and white knots as gum out of trees; and in some places so participated together as though they were all of one nature, excep∣ting the coulour, the rest of the earth on both sides being hard sandy grauell,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bolus</HI> Riuer.</NOTE> which made vs thinke it <HI>Bole-Armoniack</HI> and <HI>Terra sigillata.</HI> When we first set sayle some of our Gallants doubted nothing but that our Captaine would make too much hast home, but hauing lien in this small barge not aboue 12. or 14. dayes, oft tyred at the Oares, our bread spoyled with wet so much that it was rotten (yet so good were their stomacks that they could disgest it) they did with continuall complaints so importune him now to returne, as caused him bespeake them in this manner.</P>

as so many spirits from hell could not haue shewed more terrible. Many brauado's they made, but to appeale their fury, our Captaine prepared with as seeming a wil∣lingnesse (as they) to incounter them. But the grazing of our bullets vpon the wa∣ter (many being shot on purpose they might see them) with the Ecco of the of the woods so amazed them, as downe went their bowes and arrowes; (and ex∣changing hostage) <HI>Iames Watkins</HI> was sent six myles vp the woods to their Kings habitation. We were kindly vsed of those Salvages, of whom we vnderstood, they were commanded to betray vs, by the direction of <HI>Powhatan,</HI> and he so directed from the discontents at <HI>Iames</HI> towne, because our Captaine did cause them stay in their country against their w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls.</P>

Digging the growne aboue in the highest clifts of rocks, we saw it was a claie sand so mingled with yeallow spangles as if it had beene halfe pin-dust. In our returne inquiring still for this <HI>Matchqueon,</HI> the king of <HI>Patawomeke</HI> gaue vs guides to conduct vs vp a little riuer called <HI>Quiyough,</HI> vp which we rowed so high as we could. Leauing the bote, with six shot, and diuers Salvages, he marched seuen or eight myle before they came to the mine: leading his hostages in a small chaine they were to haue for their paines, being proud so richly to be adorned. The mine is a great Rocky mountaine like <HI>Antimony</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A myne like <HI>Antimony.</HI></NOTE> wherein they digged a great hole with shells &amp; hatchets: and hard by it, runneth a fayre brooke of <HI>Christal</HI>-like water, where they wash a way the drosse and keepe the remainder, which they put in little baggs and sell it all ouer the country to paint there bodyes, faces, or Idols; which makes them looke like Black∣mores dusted over with siluer. With so much as we could carry we returned to our bote, kindly requiting this kinde king and all his kinde people. The cause of this discovery was to search this mine, of which <HI>Newport</HI> did assure vs that those small baggs (we had giuen him) in <HI>England</HI> he had tryed to hold halfe siluer; but all we got proued of no value: also to search what furrs, the best whereof is at <HI>Cuscarawaoke,</HI> where is made so much <HI>Rawranoke</HI> or white beads that occasion as much dissention among the the Salvages, as gold and siluer amongst Christians; and what other mineralls, riuers, rocks, nations, woods, fishings, fruites, victuall, and what other commodities the land afforded: and whether the bay were endles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e or how farre it extended: of mines we were all ignorant, but a few Beuers, Otters, Beares, Martins and minkes we found, and in diuers places that aboundance of fish, lying so thicke with their heads aboue the water, as for want of nets (our barge driuing amongst them) we attempted to catch them with a frying pan: but we found it a bad instrument to catch fish with:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An aboun∣dant plenty of fish.</NOTE> neither better fish, more pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nty, nor more variety for smal fish, had any of vs euer seene in any place so swimming in the water, but they are not to be caught with frying pans: some small codd also we did see swim close by the shore by <HI>Smiths</HI> Iles, and some as high as <HI>Riccards</HI> Clifts.

But it chansed our Captaine taking a fish from his sword (not knowing her condition) being much of the fashion of a Thornback, but a long tayle like a ryding rodde, whereon the middest is a most poysoned sting, of two or three inches long, bearded like a saw on each side, which she strucke into the wrest of his arme neere an inch and a halfe: no bloud nor wound was seene, but a little blew spot, but the torment was instantly so extreame, that in foure houres had so swolen his hand, arme and shoulder, we all with much sorrow concluded his funerall, and prepared his graue in an Island by, as himselfe directed: yet it pleased God by a precious oyle Docter <HI>Russell</HI> at the first applyed to it when he sounded it with pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e (ere night) his tormenting paine was so well asswaged that he eate of the fish to his supper, which gaue no lesse ioy and content to vs then ease to himselfe, for which we called the Island <HI>Stingray</HI> Isle after the name of the fish.</P>

<P>The wind being contrary caused our stay two or three dayes at <HI>Kecoughtan</HI>: the King feasted vs with much mirth, his people were perswaded we went purposely to be revenged of the <HI>Massawomeks.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Salvages admire fire∣workes.</NOTE> In the evening we fired a few rackets, which fly∣ing in the ayre so terrified the poore Salvages, they supposed nothing vnpossible we attempted; and desired to assist vs. The first night we anchored at <HI>Stingray</HI> Isle. The next day crossed <HI>Patawomeks</HI> river, and hasted to the river <HI>Bolus.</HI> We went not much further before we might see the Bay to divide in two heads, and arriving there we found it divided in foure, all which we searched so farre as we could sayle them. Two of them we found inhabited, but in crossing the Bay, we incountred 7 or 8 Canowes full of <HI>Massawomeks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Incounter with the <HI>Mas∣sawomeks</HI> at the head of the Bay.</NOTE> we seeing them prepare to assault vs, left our Oares and made way with our sayle to incounter them, yet were we but fiue with our Captaine that could stand, for within 2 dayes after we left <HI>Kecoughtan,</HI> the rest (being all of the last supply) were sicke almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o death, vntill they were seasoned to the Country. Having shut them vnder our Tarpawling, we put their hats vpon stickes by the Barges side, and betwixt two hats a man with two peeces, to make vs seeme many, and so we thinke the <HI>Indians</HI> supposed those hats to be men, for they fled with all possible speed to the shore, and there stayed, staring at the sayling of our barge till we anchored right against them. Long it was ere we could draw them to come vnto vs. At last they sent two of their company vnarmed in a Canow, the rest all followed to second them if neede required. These two being but each presented with a bell, brought aboord all their fellowes, presenting our Captaine with veni∣son, beares flesh, fish, bowes, arrowes, clubs, targets, and beares-skinnes. We vnder∣stood them nothing at all, but by signes, whereby they signified vnto vs they had beene at warres with the <HI>Tockwoghes,</HI> the which they confirmed by shewing vs their greene wounds, but the night parting vs, we imagined they appointed the next mor∣ning to meete, but after that we never saw them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Incounter with the <HI>Tock∣whoghs.</HI></NOTE>Entring the river of <HI>Tockwogh,</HI> the Salvages all armed, in a fleete of boats, after their barbarous manner, round invironed vs; so it chanced one of them could speake the language of <HI>Powhatan,</HI> who perswaded the rest to a friendly parley. But when they saw vs furnished with the <HI>Massawomeks</HI> weapons, and we faining the invention of <HI>Kecoughtan,</HI> to haue taken them perforce; they conducted vs to their pallizado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d towne, mantelled with the barkes of trees, with scaffolds like mounts, brested about with brests very formally. Their men, women, and children with daunces, songs, fruits, furres, and what they had, kindly welcommed vs, spreading mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for vs to sit on, stretching their best abilities to expresse their loues.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hatchets from the <HI>Sasquesa∣hanocks.</HI></NOTE>Many hatchets, kniues, peeces of iron, and brasse, we saw amongst them, which they reported to haue from the <HI>Sasquesahanocks,</HI> a mightie people and mortall ene∣mies with the <HI>Massawomeks.</HI> The <HI>Sasquesahanocks</HI> inhabit vpon the chiefe Spring of these foure branches of the Bayes head, two dayes iourney higher then our barge could passe for rocks, yet we prevailed with the Interpreter to take with him ano∣ther Interpreter, to perswade the <HI>Sasquesahanocks</HI> to come visit vs, for their language are different. Three or foure dayes we expected their returne, then sixtie of those gyant-like people came downe, with presents of Venison, Tobacco pipes three foot in length, Baskets, Targets, Bowes and Arrowes. Fiue of their chiefe <HI>Werowances</HI> came boldly aboord vs to crosse the Bay for <HI>Tockwhogh,</HI> leaving their men and Ca∣nowes; the wind being so high they durst not passe.</P>
<P>Our order was daily to haue Prayer, with a Psalme, at which solemnitie the poore Salvages much wondred, our Prayers being done, a while they were busied with a consultation till they had contrived their businesse. Then they began in a most pas∣sionate

manner to hold vp their hands to the Sunne, with a most fearefull song,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Sasquesa∣hanocks</HI> offer to the <HI>English.</HI></NOTE> then imbracing our Captaine, they began to adore him in like manner: though he rebuked them, yet they proceeded till their song was finished: which done with a most strange furious action, and a hellish voyce, began an Oration of their loues; that ended, with a great painted Beares skin they covered him: then one ready with a great chayne of white Beads, weighing at least six or seaven pound, hung it about his necke, the others had 18 mantels, made of divers sorts of skinnes sowed toge∣ther; all these with many other toyes they layd at his feete, stroking their ceremoni∣ous hands about his necke for his Creation to be their Governour and Protector, promising their aydes, victualls, or what they had to be his, if he would stay with them, to defend and revenge them of the <HI>Massawomecks.</HI> But we left them at <HI>Tock∣whogh,</HI> sorrowing for our departure, yet we promised the next yeare againe to visit them. Many descriptions and discourses they made vs, of <HI>Atquanachuck, Massawo∣mek,</HI> &amp; other people, signifying they inhabit vpon a great water beyond the moun∣taines, which we vnderstood to be some great lake, or the river of <HI>Canada</HI>: and from the French to haue their hatchets and Commodities by trade. These know no more of the territories of <HI>Powhatan,</HI> then his name, and he as little of them, but the <HI>At∣quanachuks</HI> are on the Ocean Sea.</P>
<P>The highest mountaine we saw Northward wee called <HI>Perigrines</HI> mount, and a rocky river, where the <HI>Massawomeks</HI> went vp, <HI>Willowbyes</HI> river, in honor of the towne our Captaine was borne in, and that honorable house the Lord <HI>Willowby,</HI> his most honored good friend. The <HI>Sasquesahanocks</HI> river we called <HI>Smiths</HI> falles; the next poynt to <HI>Tockwhogh, Pisings</HI> poynt; the next it poynt <HI>Bourne.

In all those places and the furthest we came vp the rivers, we cut in trees so many crosses as we would, and in many places made holes in trees, wherein we writ notes, and in some places cros∣ses of brasse, to signifie to any, Englishmen had beene there.</P>
<P>Thus having sought all the inlets and rivers worth noting, we returned to disco∣ver the river of <HI>Pawtuxunt</HI>; these people we found very tractable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pawtuxunt, R.</NOTE> and more civill then any, we promised them, as also the <HI>Patawomeks</HI> to revenge them of the <HI>Massa∣womeks,</HI> but our purposes were crossed.</P>
<P>In the discovery of this river some call <HI>Rapathanock,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rapahanock,</HI> R.</NOTE> we were kindly entertained by the people of <HI>Moraughtacund</HI>; here we incountered our old friend <HI>Mosco,</HI> a lusty Salvage of <HI>Wighcocomoco</HI> vpō the river of <HI>Patawomek,</HI> we supposed him some <HI>French</HI> mans sonne, because he had a thicke blacke bush beard, and the Salvages seldome haue any at all, of which he was not a little proud,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The excee∣ding loue of the Salvage <HI>Mosco.</HI></NOTE> to see so many of his Country∣men. Wood and water he would fetch vs, guide vs any whether, nay, cause divers of his Countrymen helpe vs towe against winde or tyde from place to place till we came to <HI>Patawomek</HI>: there he rested till we returned from the head of the river, and occasioned our conduct to the mine we supposed <HI>Antimony.</HI> And in the place he fay∣led not to doe vs all the good he could, perswading vs in any case not to goe to the <HI>Rapahanocks,</HI> for they would kill vs for being friends with the <HI>Moraughtacunds</HI> that but lately had stolne three of the Kings women. This we did thinke was but that his friends might onely haue our trade: so we crossed the river to the <HI>Rapahanocks.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our fight with the <HI>Rapa∣hanocks.</HI></NOTE> There some 12 or 16 standing on the shore, directed vs a little Creeke where was good landing, and Commodities for vs in three or foure Canowes we saw lie there: but according to our custome, we demanded to exchange a man in signe of loue, which after they had a little consulted, foure or fiue came vp to the middles, to fetch our man, and leaue vs one of them, shewing we need not feare them, for they had neither clubs, bowes, nor arrowes. Notwithstanding, <HI>Anas Todkill,</HI> being sent on shore to see if he could discover any Ambuscadoes, or what they had, desired to goe over the playne to fetch some wood, but they were vnwilling, except we would come into the Creeke, where the boat might come close ashore. <HI>Todkill</HI> by degrees
<PB N="62" REF="44"/>
having got some two stones throwes vp the playne, perceived two or three hundred men (as he thought) behind the trees, so that offering to returne to the Boat, the Salvages assayed to carry him away perforce, that he called to vs we were betrayed, and by that he had spoke the word, our hostage was over-boord, but <HI>Watkins</HI> his keeper slew him in the water. Immediatly we let fly amongst them, so that they fled, &amp; <HI>Todkill</HI> escaped, yet they shot so fast that he fell flat on the ground ere he could re∣cover the boat. Here the <HI>Massawomek</HI> Targets stood vs in good stead, for vpon <HI>Mos∣co's</HI> words, we had set them about the forepart of our Boat like a forecastle, from whence we securely beat the Salvages from off the plaine without any hurt: yet they shot more then a thousand Arrowes, and then fled into the woods. Arming our selues with these light Targets (which are made of little small sticks woven betwixt strings of their hempe and silke grasse, as is our Cloth, but so firmely that no arrow can possibly pierce them:) we rescued <HI>Todkill,</HI> who was all bloudy by some of them who were shot by vs that held him, but as God pleased he had no hurt; and follow∣ing them vp to the woods, we found some slaine, and in divers places much bloud. It seems all their arrowes were spent, for we heard no more of them. Their Canows we tooke; the arrowes we found we broke, saue them we kept for <HI>Mosco,</HI> to whom we gaue the Canowes for his kindnesse, that entertained vs in the best trivmphing manner, and warlike order in armes of conquest he could procure of the <HI>Moraugh∣tacunds.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Salvages disguised like bushes fight.</NOTE>The rest of the day we spent in accomodating our Boat, in stead of thoules wee made stickes like Bedstaues, to which we fastened so many of our <HI>Massawomek</HI> Tar∣gets, that invironed her as wast clothes. The next morning we went vp the river, and our friend <HI>Mosco</HI> followed vs along the shore, and at last desired to goe with vs in our Boat. But as we passed by <HI>Pisacack, Matchopeak,</HI> and <HI>Mecuppom,</HI> three Townes situated vpon high white clay clifts; the other side all a low playne marish, and the river there but narrow. Thirtie or fortie of the <HI>Rapahanocks,</HI> had so accommodated themselues with branches, as we tooke them for little bushes growing among the sedge, still seeing their arrowes strike the Targets, and dropped in the river: where-at <HI>Mosco</HI> fell flat in the Boat on his face, crying the <HI>Rapahanocks,</HI> which presently we espied to be the bushes, which at our first volley fell downe in the sedge: when wee were neare halfe a myle from them, they shewed themselues dauncing and singing very merrily.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Pissassack, Nandtaughtacund,</HI> and <HI>Cuttatawomen,</HI> vsed vs kindly, and all their people neglected not any thing to <HI>Mosco</HI> to bring vs to them. Betwixt <HI>Se∣cobeck</HI> and <HI>Massawteck</HI> is a small Isle or two, which causeth the river to be broader then ordinary; there it pleased God to take one of our Company called M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Fether∣stone,</HI> that all the time he had beene in this Country, had behaved himselfe, honest∣ly, valiantly, and industriously, where in a little Bay we called <HI>Fetherstones</HI> Bay wee buryed him with a volley of shot: the rest notwithstanding their ill dyet, and bad lodging, crowded in so small a Barge, in so many dangers never resting, but alwayes tossed to and againe, had all well recovered their healths. The next day wee sayled so high as our Boat would float, there setting vp crosses, and graving our names in the trees. Our Sentinell saw an arrow fall by him, though we had ranged vp and downe more then an houre in digging in the earth, looking of stones, herbs, and springs, not seeing where a Salvage could well hide himselfe.</P>

In the meane time we contented <HI>Mosco</HI> in helping him to gather vp their arrowes, which were an armefull, whereof he gloried not a little. Then we desired <HI>Mosco</HI> to know what he was, and what Countries were beyond the mountaines; the poore Salvage mildly answered, he and all with him were of <HI>Hasinninga,</HI> where there are three Kings more, like vnto them, namely the King of <HI>Stegora,</HI> the King of <HI>Tauxun∣tania,</HI> and the King of <HI>Shakahonea,</HI> that were come to <HI>Moha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kahod,</HI> which is onely a hunting Towne, and the bounds betwixt the Kingdome of the <HI>Mannahocks,</HI> and the <HI>Nandtaughtacunds,</HI> but hard by where we were. We demanded why they came in that manner to betray vs, that came to them in peace, and to seeke their loues; he answered, they heard we were a people come from vnder the world, to take their world from them. We asked him how many worlds he did know, he replyed, he knew no more but that which was vnder the skie that covered him, which were the <HI>Powhatans,</HI> with the <HI>Monacans,</HI> and the <HI>Massawomeks,</HI> that were higher vp in the mountaines. Then we asked him what was beyond the mountaines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His relation of their coun∣tries.</NOTE> he answe∣red the Sunne: but of any thing els he knew nothing; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">They cannot trauell but where the woods are burnt.</NOTE> because the woods were not burnt. These and many such questions wee demanded, concerning the <HI>Massawo∣meks,</HI> the <HI>Monacans,</HI> their owne Country, and where were the Kings of <HI>Stegora, Tauxsintania,</HI> and the rest. The <HI>Monacans</HI> he sayd were their neighbours and friends, and did dwell as they in the hilly Countries by small rivers, liuing vpon rootes and fruits, but chiefly by hunting. The <HI>Massawomeks</HI> did dwell vpon a great water, and had many boats, &amp; so many men that they made warre with all the world. For their Kings, they were gone every one a severall way with their men on hunting: But those with him came thither a fishing till they saw vs, notwithstanding they would be altogether at night at <HI>Mahaskahod.</HI> For his relation we gaue him many toyes, with perswasions to goe with vs, and he as earnestly desired vs to stay the comming of those Kings that for his good vsage should be friends with vs, for he was brother to <HI>Hasinninga.</HI> But <HI>Mosco</HI> advised vs presently to be gone, for they were all naught, yet we told him we would not till it was night. All things we made ready to enter∣tain what came, &amp; <HI>Mosco</HI> was as diligent in trimming his arrowes. The night being come we all imbarked, for the riuer was so narrow, had it beene light the land on the one side was so high, they might haue done vs exceeding much mischiefe. All this while the K. of <HI>Hasinninga</HI> was seeking the rest, and had consultation a good time what to doe. But by their espi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s seeing we were gone, it was not long before we heard their arrowes dropping on every side the Boat; we cause<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our Salvages to call vnto them, but such a yelling &amp; hallowing they made that they heard nothing, but now and then a peece, ayming so neare as we could where we heard the most voyces. More then 12 myles they followed vs in this manner; then the day appea∣ring, we found our selues in a broad Bay, out of danger of their shot, where wee came to an anchor, and fell to breakfast. Not so much as speaking to them till the Sunne was risen; being well refreshed, we vntyed our Targets that couered vs as a Deck, and all shewed our selues with those shields on our armes, and swords in our hands, and also our prisoner <HI>Amoroleck</HI>; a long discourse there was betwixt his Countrimen and him, how good wee were, how well wee vsed him, how wee had a <HI>Patawomek</HI> with vs, loued vs as his life, that would haue slaine him had we not pre∣serued him, and that he should haue his libertie would they be but friends;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How we con∣cluded peace with the foure kings of <HI>Mona∣hoke.</HI></NOTE> and to doe vs any hurt it was impossible. Vpon this they all hung their Bowes and Qui∣vers vpon the trees, and one came swimming aboord vs with a Bow tyed on his head, and another with a Quiver of Arrowes, which they deliuered our Captaine as a present, the Captaine hauing vsed them so kindly as he could, told them the o∣ther three Kings should doe the like, and then the great King of our world should be their friend, whose men we were. It was no sooner demanded but performed, so
<PB N="64" REF="45"/>
vpon a low Moorish poynt of Land we went to the shore, where those foure Kings came and receiued <HI>Amoroleck</HI>: nothing they had but Bowes, Arrowes, Tobacco-bags, and Pipes: what we desired, none refused to giue vs, wondering at every thing we had, and heard we had done: our Pistols they tooke for pipes, which they much desired, but we did content them with other Commodities, and so we left foure or fiue hundred of our merry <HI>Mannahocks,</HI> singing, dauncing, and making merry, and set sayle for <HI>Moraughtacund.</HI></P>
<P>In our returnes we visited all our friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How we be∣came friends with the <HI>Ra∣pahanocks.</HI></NOTE> that reioyced much at our Victory a∣gainst the <HI>Mannahocks,</HI> who many times had Warres also with them, but now they were friends, and desired we would be friends with the <HI>Rapahanocks,</HI> as we were with the <HI>Mannahocks.</HI> Our Captaine told them, they had twise assaulted him that came onely in loue to doe them good, and therefore he would now burne all their hou∣ses, destroy their corne, and for euer hold them his enemies, till they made him sa∣tisfaction; they desired to know what that should be: he told them they should pre∣sent him the Kings Bow and Arrowes, and not offer to come armed where he was; that they should be friends with the <HI>Moraughtacunds</HI> his friends, and giue him their Kings sonne in pledge to performe it, and then all King <HI>Iames</HI> his men should be their friends. Vpon this they presently sent to the <HI>Rapahanocks</HI> to meete him at the place where they first fought, where would be the Kings of <HI>Nantautacund</HI> and <HI>Pis∣sassac</HI>: which according to their promise were there so soone as we; where <HI>Rapahanock</HI> presented his Bow and Arrowes, and confirmed all we desired, except his sonne, ha∣ving no more but him he could not liue without him, but in stead of his sonne he would giue him the three women <HI>Moraughtacund</HI> had stol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. This was accepted: and so in three or foure Canowes, so many as could went with vs to <HI>Moraughtacund,</HI> where <HI>Mosco</HI> made them such relations, and gaue to his friends so many Bowes and Arrowes, that they no lesse loued him then admired vs. The 3 women were brought our Captaine, to each he gaue a chayne of Beads: and then causing <HI>Moraughtacund, Mosco,</HI> and <HI>Rapahanock</HI> stand before him, bid <HI>Rapahanock</HI> take her he loued best, and <HI>Moraughtacund</HI> chuse next, &amp; to <HI>Mosco</HI> he gaue the third. Vpon this away went their Canowes over the water, to fetch their venison, and all the provision they could, and they that wanted Boats swam over the river: the darke commanded vs then to rest. The next day there was of men, women, and children, as we coniectured, six or sea∣uen hundred, dauncing, &amp; singing, and not a Bow nor Arrow seene amongst them. <HI>Mosco</HI> changed his name <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tasantascugh,</HI> which we interpret <HI>Stranger,</HI> for so they call vs. All promising ever to be our friends, and to plant Corne purposely for vs; and we to provide hatchets, beads, and copper for them, we departed, giuing them a Volley of shot, and they vs as loud shouts and cryes as their strengths could vtter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The discovery of <HI>Payanka∣tank.</HI></NOTE> That night we anchored in the river of <HI>Payankatank,</HI> and discovered it so high as it was navigable, but the people were most a hunting, saue a few old men, women, and children, that were tending their corne, of which they promised vs part when we would fetch it, as had done all the Nations where ever we had yet beene.</P>
<P>In a fayre calme, rowing towards poynt <HI>Comfort,</HI> we anchored in <HI>Gosnolls</HI> Bay, but such a suddaine gust surprised vs in the night with thunder and rayne, that we never thought more to haue seene <HI>Iames</HI> Towne.

<P>So setting sayle for the Southerne shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A notable trechery of the <HI>Nandsa∣munds.</HI></NOTE> we sayled vp a narrow river vp the coun∣try of <HI>Chisapeack</HI>; it hath a good channell, but many shoules about the entrance.

But not seeing nor hearing any people, and the riuer very nar∣row, we returned to the great riuer, to see if we could finde any of them. Coasting
<PB N="65" REF="45"/>
the shore towards <HI>Nandsamund,</HI> which is most Oyster-bankes; at the mouth of that riuer, we espied six or seauen Salvages making their wires, who presently fled: a∣shore we went, and where they wrought we threw diuers toyes, and so departed. Farre we were not gone ere they came againe, and began to sing, and daunce, and recall vs: and thus we began our first acquaintance. At last one of them desired vs to goe to his house vp that riuer, into our Boat voluntarily he came, the rest ran af∣ter vs by the shore with all shew of loue that could be. Seauen or eight myles we say∣led vp this narrow riuer: at last on the Westerne shore we saw large Cornefields, in the midst a little Isle, and in it was abundance of Corne; the people he told vs were all a hunting, but in the Isle was his house, to which he inuited vs with much kindnesse: to him▪ his wife, and children, we gaue such things as they seemed much contented them. The others being come, desired vs also to goe but a little higher to see their houses: here our host left vs, the rest rowed by vs in a Canow, till we were so far past the Isle the riuer became very narrow. Here we desired some of them to come abord vs, wherat pausing a little, they told vs they would but fetch their bows and arrowes and goe all with vs, but being a-shore and thus armed, they perswaded vs to goe forward, but we could neither perswade them into their Canow, nor into our Boat. This gaue vs cause to prouide for the worst. Farre we went not ere seauen or eight Canowes full of men armed appeared following vs, staying to see the con∣clusion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fight with the <HI>Chi∣sapeacks</HI> and <HI>Nandsamund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> Presently from each side the riuer came arrowes so fast as two or three hun∣dred could shoot them, whereat we returned to get the open. They in the Canowes let fly also as fast, but amongst them we bestowed so many shot, the most of them leaped overboard and swam ashore, but two or three escaped by rowing, being a∣gainst their playnes: our Muskets they found shot further then their Bowes, for wee made not twentie shot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re they all retyred behind the next trees. Being thus got out of their trap, we seised on all their Canowes, and moored them in the midst of the open. More then an hundred arrowes stucke in our Targets, and about the boat, yet none hurt, onely <HI>Anthony Bagnall</HI> was shot in his Hat, and another in his sleeue. But seeing their multitudes, and suspecting as it was, that both the <HI>Nandsamunds,</HI> and the <HI>Chisapeacks</HI> were together, we thought it best to ryde by their Canowes a while, to bethinke if it were better to burne all in the Isle, or draw them to compo∣sition, till we were prouided to take all they had, which was sufficient to feed all our <HI>Colony</HI>: but to burne the Isle at night it was concluded. In the interim we began to cut in peeces their Canowes, and they presently to lay downe their bowes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they be∣came friends.</NOTE> making signes of peace: peace we told them we would accept, would they bring vs their Kings bowes and arrowes, with a chayne of pearle; and when we came againe giue vs foure hundred baskets full of Corne, otherwise we would breake all their boats, and burne their houses, and corne, and all they had. To performe all this they al∣ledged onely the want of a Canow; so we put one a drift &amp; bad them swim to fetch her: and till they performed their promise, wee would but onely breake their Ca∣nowes. They cryed to vs to doe no more, all should be as we would: which presently they performed, away went their bowes and arrowes, and tagge and ragge came with their baskets: so much as we could carry we tooke, and so departing good friends, we returned to <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, where we safely arrived the 7. of September,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ding at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne.</NOTE> 1608.

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII. The Presidency surrendred to Captaine <HI>Smith:</HI> the Arrivall and returne of the second Supply. And what happened.</HEAD>
<P>THe tenth of September, by the Election of the Councell, and request of the Company, Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> receiued the Letters Patents: which till then by no meanes he would accept, though he was often importuned therevnto. Now the building of <HI>Ratliffes</HI> Pallace stayed as a thing needlesse; the Church was repaired; the Store-house recouered; buildings prepared for the Supplyes, we expected; the Fort reduced to a fiue-square forme; the order of the Watch renew∣ed; the squadrons (each setting of the Watch) trained; the whole Company euery Saturday exercised, in the plaine by the west Bulwarke, prepared for that purpose, we called <HI>Smithfield</HI>: where sometimes more then an hundred Salvages would stand in an amazement to behold, how a fyle would batter a tree, where he would make them a marke to shoot at; the boats trimmed for trade, which being sent out with Lieutenant <HI>Percy,</HI> in their Iourney incountred the second Supply, that brought them backe to discover the Country of <HI>Monacan.</HI> How or why Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> obtained such a private Commission, as not to returne without a lumpe of gold, a certaintie of the South sea, or one of the lost company sent out by Sir <HI>Water Raleigh,</HI> I know not; nor why he brought such a fiue peeced Barge, not to beare vs to that South sea, till we had borne her over the mountaines, which how farre they extend is yet vnknowne.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Powhatans</HI> scorne when his courtesie was most de∣served.</NOTE> As for the Coronation of <HI>Powhatan,</HI> and his presents of Bason and Ewer, Bed, Bedstead, Clothes, and such costly nouelties, they had beene much better well spared then so ill spent, for wee had his favour much better onely for a playne peece of Copper, till this stately kinde of soliciting, made him so much o∣vervalue himselfe, that he respected vs as much as nothing at all. As for the hyring of the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>-men, to make Pitch, Tar, Glasse▪ Milles, and Sope ashes, when the Country is replenished with people, and necessaries, would haue done well, but to send them and seauentie more without victualls to worke, was not so well aduised nor considered of, as it should haue beene. Yet this could not haue hurt vs had they beene 200. though then we were 130 that wanted for our selues. For we had the Salvages in that <HI>decorum</HI> (their harvest being newly gathered, that we fea∣red not to get victuals for 500.<NOTE PLACE="marg">No better way to over∣throw the bu∣sines then by our instruc∣tors.</NOTE> Now was there no way to make vs miserable, but to neglect that time to make prouision whilst it was to be had, the which was done by the direction from <HI>England</HI> to performe this strange discovery, but a more strange Coronation to loose that time, spend that victualls we had, tyre and starue our men, hauing no meanes to carry victuals, munition, the hurt or sicke, but on their owne backes. How or by whom they were inuented I know not: but Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> we onely accounted the Author, who to effect these proiects, had so guilded mens hopes with great promises, that both Company and Councell concluded his resolu∣tion
<PB N="67" REF="46"/>
for the most part: God doth know they little knew what they did, nor vnder∣stood their owne estates to conclude his conclusions, against all the inconveniences the foreseeing President alledged. Of this Supply there was added to the Councell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A consultati∣on, where all the Councell was against the President.</NOTE> one Captaine <HI>Richard Waldo,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Wynne,</HI> two auncient Souldiers, and vali∣ant Gentlemen, but yet ignorant of the busines, (being but newly arriued.) <HI>Ratliffe</HI> was also permitted to haue his voyce, &amp; M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Scrivener,</HI> desirous to see strange Coun∣tries: so that although <HI>Smith</HI> was President, yet the Maior part of the Councell had the authoritie and ruled it as they listed. As for clearing <HI>Smiths</HI> obiections, how Pitch and Tarre, Wainscot, Clapbord, Glasse, and Sope ashes, could be provided, to relade the ship, or provision got to liue withall, when none was in the Country, and that we had, spent, before the ship departed to effect these projects. The answer was, Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> vndertooke to fraught the Pinnace of twentie tunnes with Corne in going and returning in his Discovery, and to refraught her againe from <HI>Werowocomoco</HI> of <HI>Powhatan.</HI> Also promising a great proportion of victualls from the Ship; inferring that <HI>Smiths</HI> propositions were onely devices to hinder his iourney, to effect it himselfe; and that the crueltie he had vsed to the Salvages, might well be the occasion to hinder these Designes, and seeke revenge on him. For which taxa∣tion all workes were left, and 120 chosen men were appointed for <HI>Newports</HI> guard in this Discovery. But Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> to make cleare all those seeming suspitions, that the Salvages were not so desperate as was pretended by Captaine <HI>Newport,</HI> and how willing (since by their authoritie they would haue it so) he was to assist them what he could, because the Coronation would consume much time, he vndertooke himselfe their message to <HI>Powhatan,</HI> to intreat him to come to <HI>Iames</HI> Towne to re∣ceiue his presents. And where <HI>Newport</HI> durst not goe with lesse then 120. he onely tooke with him Captaine <HI>Waldo,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Andrew Buckler, Edward Brinton,</HI> and <HI>Samuel Collier</HI>: with these foure he went over land to <HI>Werowocomoco,</HI> some 12 myles;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Smith</HI> goeth with 4. to <HI>Powhatan,</HI> when <HI>Newport</HI> feared with 120.</NOTE> there he passed the river of <HI>Pamavnkee</HI> in a Salvage Canow. <HI>Powhatan</HI> being 30 myles of, was presently sent for: in the meane time, <HI>Pocahontas</HI> and her women entertained Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> in this manner.</P>
<P>In a fayre plaine field they made a fire, before which▪ he sitting vpon a mat, sud∣dainly amongst the woods was heard such a hydeous noise and shreeking, that the English betooke themselues to their armes, and seized on two or three old men by them, supposing <HI>Powhatan</HI> with all his power was come to surprise them. But pre∣sently <HI>Pocahontas</HI> came, willing him to kill her if any hurt were intended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Virginia</HI> Maske.</NOTE> and the beholders, which were men, women, and children, satisfied the Captaine there was no such matter. Then presently they were presented with this anticke; thirtie young women came naked out of the woods, onely covered behind and before with a few greene leaues, their bodies all painted, some of one colour, some of another, but all differing, their leader had a fayre payre of Bucks hornes on her head, and an Otters skinne at her girdle, and another at her arme, a quiver of arrowes at her backe, a bow and arrowes in her hand; the next had in her hand a sword, another a club, another a pot-sticke; all horned alike: the rest every one with their severall devises. These fiends with most hellish shouts and cryes, rushing from among the trees, cast them∣selues in a ring about the fire, singing and dauncing with most excellent ill varietie, oft falling into their infernall passions, and solemnly againe to sing and daunce; ha∣ving spent neare an houre in this Mascarado, as they entred in like manner they de∣parted.</P>
<P>Having reaccōmodated themselues, they solemnly invited him to their lodgings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Womens entertaine∣ment.</NOTE> where he was no sooner within the house, but all these Nymphes more tormented him then ever, with crowding, pressing, and hanging about him, most tediously crying, Loue you not me? loue you not me? This salutation ended, the feast was set, consisting of all the Salvage dainties they could devise: some attending, others sing∣ing and dauncing about them; which mirth being ended, with fire-brands in stead of Torches they conducted him to his lodging.</P>
<LG>
<L>Thus did they shew their feats of armes, and others art in dauncing:</L>
<L>Some other vs'd there oaten pipe, and others voyces chanting.</L>

Many other discourses they had (yet both content to giue each other content in complementall Courtesies) and so Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> returned with this Answer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Powhatans</HI> Coronation.</NOTE>Vpon this the Presents were sent by water which is neare an hundred myles, and the Captains went by land with fiftie good shot. All being met at <HI>Werowocomoco,</HI> the next day was appointed for his Coronation, then the presents were brought him, his Bason and Ewer, Bed and furniture set vp, his scarlet Cloke and apparell with much adoe put on him, being perswaded by <HI>Namontack</HI> they would not hurt him: but a soule trouble there was to make him kneele to receiue his Crowne, he neither knowing the maiesty nor meaning of a Crowne, nor bending of the knee, endured so many perswasions, examples, and instructions, as tyred them all; at last by lea∣ning hard on his shoulders, he a little stooped, and three having the crowne in their hands put it on his head, when by the warning of a Pistoll the Boats were prepared with such a volley of shot, that the King start vp in a horrible feare, till he saw all was well. Then remembring himselfe, to congratulate their kindnesse, he gaue his old shooes and his mantell to Captaine <HI>Newport</HI>: but perceiving his purpose was to discover the <HI>Monacans,</HI> he laboured to divert his resolution, refusing to lend him ei∣ther men or guides more then <HI>Namontack</HI>; and so after some small complement all kindnesse on both sides, in requitall of his presents he presented <HI>Newport</HI> with a heape of wheat eares that might containe some 7 or 8 Bushels, and as much more we bought in the Towne, wherewith we returned to the Fort.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The discove∣ry of <HI>Monacan.</HI></NOTE>The Ship having disburdened her selfe of 70 persons, with the first Gentlewoman and woman-seruant that arrived in our <HI>Colony.</HI> Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> with 120 chosen men, led by Captaine <HI>Waldo,</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Percie,</HI> Captaine <HI>Winne,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>West,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Scrivener,</HI> set forward for the discovery of <HI>Monacan,</HI> leaving the President at the Fort with about 80. or 90. (such as they were) to relade the Ship. Arriving at the Falles we marched by land some fortie myles in two dayes and a halfe, and so returned downe the same path we went. Two townes we discovered of the <HI>Monacans,</HI> called <HI>Massinacak</HI> and <HI>Mowhemenchouch,</HI> the people neither vsed vs well nor ill, yet for our securitie we tooke one of their petty Kings, and led him bound to conduct vs the way. And in our returnes searched many places we supposed Mines, about which we spent some time in refyning, having one <HI>William Gallicut,</HI> a refyner fitted for that purpose. From that crust of earth we digged, he perswaded vs to beleeue he extrac∣ted some small quantitie of silver; and (not vnlikely) better stuffe might be had for the digging. With this poore tryall, being contented to leaue this fayre, fertile, well watered Country; and comming to the Falles, the Salvages fayned there were divers ships come into the Bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Sal∣vages deluded Cap. <HI>Newport.</HI></NOTE> to kill them at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne. Trade they would not, and finde their Corne we could not; for they had hid it in the woods: and being thus deluded, we arrived at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, halfe sicke, all complaining, and tyred with toyle, famine, and discontent, to haue onely but discovered our guilded hopes, and such fruitlesse certainties, as Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> fortold vs.</P>

<L>But those that hunger seeke to slake,</L>

<L><PB N="69" REF="47"/>Can fill their greedie appetite;</L>
<L>It is a thing so infinite.</L>
</LG>
<P>No sooner were we landed, but the President dispersed so many as were able, some for Glasse, others for Tarre, Pitch, and Sope-ashes, leauing them with the Fort to the Councels oversight, but 30 of vs he conducted downe the river some 5 myles from <HI>Iames</HI> towne, to learne to make Clapbord, cut downe trees, and lye in woods. Amongst the rest he had chosen <HI>Gabriel Beadle,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Russell,</HI> the onely two gal∣lants of this last Supply, and both proper Gentlemen. Strange were these pleasures to their conditions; yet lodging, eating, and drinking, working or playing, they but doing as the President did himselfe. All these things were carried so pleasantly as within a weeke they became Masters: making it their delight to heare the trees thunder as they fell; but the Axes so oft blistered their tender fingers, that many times every third blow had a loud othe to drowne the eccho; for remedie of which sinne, the President devised how to haue every mans othes numbred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A punishment for swearing.</NOTE> and at night for every othe to haue a Cann of water powred downe his sleeue, with which every offender was so washed (himselfe and all) that a man should scarce heare an othe in a weeke.</P>

<L>For he who scornes and makes but iests of cursings, and his othe,</L>
<L>He doth contemne, not man but God, nor God, nor man, but both.</L>
</LG>
<P>By this, let no man thinke that the President and these Gentlemen spent their times as common Wood-haggers at felling of trees, or such other like labours, or that they were pressed to it as hirelings, or common slaues; for what they did, after they were but once a little invred, it seemed and some conceited it, onely as a plea∣sure and recreation, yet 30 or 40 of such voluntary Gentlemen would doe more in a day then 100 of the rest that must be prest to it by compulsion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.

<P>Master <HI>Scrivener,</HI> Captaine <HI>Waldo,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Winne</HI> at the Fort, every one in like manner carefully regarded their charge. The President returning from amongst the woods, seeing the time consumed and no provision gotten, (and the Ship lay idle at a great charge and did nothing) presently imbarked himselfe in the discove∣ry barge, giving order to the Councell to send Lieutenant <HI>Percie</HI> after him with the next barge that arrived at the Fort; two Barges he had himselfe and 18 men, but arriving at <HI>Chickahamania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Chicka∣hamania's</HI> for∣ced to contri∣bution.</NOTE> that dogged Nation was too well acquainted with our wants, refusing to trade, with as much scorne and insolency as they could expresse. The President perceiuing it was <HI>Powhatans</HI> policy to starue vs, told them he came not so much for their Corne, as to revenge his imprisonment, and the death of his men murthered by them, and so landing his men and readie to charge them, they immediately fled: and presently after sent their Ambassadors with corne, fish, foule, and what they had to make their peace, (their Corne being that yeare but bad) they complained extreamely of their owne wants, yet fraughted our Boats with an hun∣dred Bushels of Corne, and in like manner Lieutenant <HI>Percies,</HI> that not long after arrived, and having done the best they could to content vs, we parted good friends, and returned to <HI>Iames</HI> towne.</P>
<P>Though this much contented the Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bad reward for well-do∣ing.</NOTE> (that feared nothing more then starving) yet some so envied his good successe, that they rather desired to hazzard a starving, then his paines should proue so much more effectuall then theirs. Some proiects there were invented by <HI>Newport</HI> and <HI>Ratliffe,</HI> not onely to haue deposed him, but to haue kept him out of the Fort; for that being President, he would leaue his place and the Fort without their consents, but their hornes were so much too short to effect it, as they themselues more narrowly escaped a greater mischiefe.</P>
<P>All this time our old Taverne made as much of all them that had either money or ware as could be desired:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A good Ta∣verne in <HI>Vir∣ginia.</HI></NOTE> by this time they were become so perfect on all sides (I meane the souldiers, saylers, and Salvages) as there was tenne times more care to maintaine their damnabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and private trade, then to provide for the <HI>Colony</HI> things

that were necessary. Neither was it a small policy in <HI>Newport</HI> and the Marriners to report in <HI>England</HI> we had such plentie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bad trade of the masters and saylers.</NOTE> and bring vs so many men without victuals, when they had so many private Factors in the Fort, that within six or seauen weeks, of two or three hundred Axes, Chissels, Hows, and Pick-axes, scarce twentie could be found: and for Pike-heads, shot, Powder, or any thing they could steale from their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llowes, was vendible; they knew as well (and as secretly) how to convey them to trade with the Salvages for Furres, Baskets, <HI>Mussaneeks,</HI> young Beasts, or such like Commodities, as exchange them with the Saylers for Butter, Cheese, Beefe, Porke, <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> Beere, Bisket, Oatmeale, and Oyle: and then fayne all was sent them from their friends And though <HI>Virginia</HI> affoorded no Furres for the Store, yet one Master in one voyage hath got so many by this indirect meanes, as he confessed to haue sold in <HI>England</HI> for 30<SUP>l</SUP>.</P>
<P>Those are the Saint-seeming Worthies of <HI>Virginia,</HI> that haue notwithstanding all this meate, drinke, and wages; but now they begin to grow weary, their trade being both perceived and prevented; none hath beene in <HI>Virginia</HI> that hath observed any thing, which knowes not this to be true, and yet the losse, the scorne, the misery, and shame, was the poore Officers, Gentlemen, and carelesse Governours, who were all thus bought &amp; sold; the adventurers cousened, and the action overthrowne by their false excuses, informations, and directions. By this let all men iudge, how this busi∣nesse could prosper, being thus abused <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y such pilfring occasions. And had not Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> cryed <HI>Peccavi,</HI> the President would haue discharged the ship, and caused him to haue stayed one yeare in <HI>Virginia,</HI> to learne to speake of his owne experience.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>¶ The Copy of a Letter sent to the Treasurer and Councell of <HI>Virginia</HI> from Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> then President in VIRGINIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honorable, &amp;c.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Received your Letter, wherein you write, that our minds are so set vpon facti∣on, and idle conceits in diuiding the Country without your consents, and that we feed <HI>You</HI> but with ifs &amp; ands, hopes, &amp; some few proofes; as if we would keepe the myste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of the businesse to our selues: and that we must expresly follow your instructions sent by Captain <HI>Newport:</HI> the charge of whose voyage amounts to neare two thousand pounds, the which if we cannot defray by the Ships returne, we are like to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>main as banished men. To these particulars I humbly intreat your Pardons if I offend you with my rude Answer.</P>
<P>For our factions, vnlesse you would haue me run away and leaue the Country, I ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>not prevent them, because I do make many stay that would els fly any whether. For the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Letter sent to my Lord of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> by the President and his conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣derats, for diuiding the Country &amp;c. What it was I know not, for you saw no hand
<PB N="71" REF="48"/>
of mine to it; nor euer dream't I of any such matter. That we feed you with hopes, &amp;c. Though I be no scholer, I am past a schoole boy; and I desire but to know, what either you, and these here doe know, but that I haue learned to tell you by the continuall hazard of my life. I haue not concealed from you any thing I know; but I feare some cause you to beleeue much more then is true.</P>
<P>Expresly to follow your direstions by Captaine <HI>Newport,</HI> though they be perfor∣med, I was directly against it; but according to our Commission, I was content to be overrul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the maior part of the Councell, I feare to the hazard of vs all; which now is generally confessed when it is too late. Onely Captaine <HI>Winne</HI> and Captaine <HI>Waldo</HI> I haue sworne of the Councell, and Crowned <HI>Powhatan</HI> accor∣ding to you instructions.</P>
<P>For th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> charge of this Voyage of two or three thousand pounds, we haue not recei∣ued the value of an hundred pounds. And for the quartred Boat to be borne by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Souldiers over the Falles, <HI>Newport</HI> had <HI>120</HI> of the best men he could chuse. If he had burnt her to ash<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, one might haue carried her in a bag, but as she is, fiue hun∣dred cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, to a navigable place aboue the Falles. And for him at that time to find in the South Sea, a Mine of gold; or any of them sent by Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh:</HI> at our Consultation I told them was as likely as the rest. But during this great disco∣very of thirtie myles, (which might as well haue beene done by one man, and much more, for the value of a pound of Copper at a seasonable tyme) they had the Pinnace and all the Boats with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, but one that remained with me to serue the Fort. In their absence I followed the new begun workes of Pitch and Tarre, Glasse, Sope-ashes, and Clapboord, whereof some small quantities we haue sent you. But if you rightly consider, what an infinite toyle it is in <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Swethland,</HI> where the woods are proper for naught els, and though there be the helpe both of man and beast in those ancient Common-wealths, which many an hundred yeares haue vsed it, yet thousands of those poore people can scarce g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t necessaries to liue, but from h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to mouth. And though your Factors there can buy as much in a week as will fraught you a ship, or as much as you please; you must not expect from vs any such matter, which are but a many of ignorant miserable soules, that are scarce able to get wherewith to liue, and defend our selues against the inconstant <HI>Salvages:</HI> fin∣ding but here and there a tree fit for the purpose, and want all things els the <HI>Rus∣sians</HI> haue. For the Coronation of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>whatan,</HI> by whose advice you sent him such presents, I know not; but this giue me leaue to tell you, I feare th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y will be the con∣fusion of vs all ere we heare from you againe. At your Ships arrivall, the <HI>Salvages</HI> harvest was newly gathered, and we going to buy it, our owne not being halfe suf∣ficient for so great a number. As for the two ships loading of Corne <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wport</HI> pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mised to provide vs from <HI>Powhatan,</HI> he brought vs but foureteene Bushels; and from the <HI>Monacans</HI> nothing, but the most of the men sicke and neare famished. From your Ship we had not provision in victuals worth twenty pound, and we are more then two hundred to liue vpon this: the one halfe sicke, the other little better. For the Saylers (I confesse) they daily make good cheare, but our dyet is a little meale and water, and not sufficient of that. Though there be fish in the Sea, foules in the ayre, and Beasts in the woods, their bounds are so large, they so wilde, and we so weake and ignorant, we cannot much trouble them. Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> we much suspect to be the Authour of those inventions. Now that you should know, I haue made you as great a discovery as he, for lesse charge then he spendeth you e∣very meale; I haue sent you this Mappe of the Bay and Rivers, with an annexed
<PB N="72" REF="49"/>
Relation of the Countries and Nations that inhabit them, as you may see at large. Also two barrels of stones, and such as I take to be good Iron ore at the least; so de∣vided, as by their notes you may see in what places I found them. The Souldiers say many of your officers maintaine their families out of that you send vs: and that <HI>Newport</HI> hath an hundred pounds a yeare for carrying newes. For every master you haue yet sent can find the way as well as he, so that an hundred pounds might be spared, which is more then we haue all, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t helpe to pay him wages. Cap. <HI>Rat∣liffe</HI> is now called <HI>Sickl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>more,</HI> a poore counterfeited Imposture. I haue sent you him home, least the company should cut his throat. What he is, now every one can tell you: if he and <HI>Archer</HI> returne againe, they are sufficient to keepe vs alwayes in fa∣ctions. When you send againe I intreat you rather send but thirty Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>penters, hus∣bandmen, gardiners, fisher men, blacksmiths, masons, and diggers vp of trees, roots, well provided; then a thousand of such as we haue: for except wee be able both to lodge them, and feed them, the most will consume with want of necessaries before they can be made good for any thing. Thus if you please to consider this account, and of the vnnecessary wages to Captaine <HI>Newport,</HI> or his ships so long lingering and staying here (for notwithstanding his boasting to leaue vs victuals for <HI>12</HI> mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ths, though we had <HI>89</HI> by this discovery lame and sicke, and but a pinte of Corne a day for a man, we were constrained to giue him three hogsheads of that to victuall him homeward) or yet to send into <HI>Germany</HI> or <HI>Poleland</HI> for glasse-men &amp; the rest, till we be able to sustaine our selues, and relieue them when they come. It were bet∣ter to giue fiue hundred pound a tun for those grosse Commodities in <HI>Denmarke,</HI> then send for them hither, till more necessary things be provided. For in over-toy∣ling our weake and vnskilfull bodies, to satisfie this desire of present profit, we can scarce ever recover our selues from one Supply to another. And I humbly intreat you hereafter, let vs know what we should receiue, and not stand to the Saylers courtesie to leaue vs what they please, els you may charge vs with what you will, but we not you with any thing. These are the causes that haue kept vs in <HI>Virginia,</HI> from laying such a foundation, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re this might haue given much better content and satisfaction; but as yet you must not looke for any profitable returnes: so I humbly rest.</P>

<P>These poore conclusions so affrighted vs all with famine,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nandsamund</HI> forced to con¦tribution.</NOTE> that the President pro∣vided for <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndsamund,</HI> and tooke with him Captaine <HI>Winne,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Scrivener,</HI> then returning from Captaine <HI>Newport.</HI> These people also long denied him not onely the 400 Baskets of Corne th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y promised, but any trade at all; (excusing themselues they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pent most they had, and were commanded by <HI>Powhatan</HI> to keepe that they had, and not to let vs come into their river) till we were constrained to begin with them perforce. Vpon the discharging of our Muskets they all fled and shot not an Arrow; the first house we came to we set on fire, which when they perceiued, they desired we would make no more spoyle, and they would giue vs halfe they had: how they collected it I know not, but before night they loaded our three Boats; and so we returned to our quarter some foure myles downe the River, which was onely the open woods vnder the lay of a hill, where all the ground was covered with snow, and hard frozen; the snow we digged away and made a great fire in the place; when the ground was well dryed, we turned away the fire; and covering the place with a mat, there we lay very warme. To keepe vs from the winde we made a shade of another Mat; as the winde turned we turned our shade, and when the ground grew cold we remoued the fire. And thus many a cold winter night haue wee laine in this miserable manner, yet those that most commonly went vpon all those occa∣sions, were alwayes in health, lusty, and sat. For sparing them this yeare, the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt yeare they promised to plant purposely for vs; and so we returned to <HI>Iames</HI> towne. About this time there was a marriage betwixt <HI>Iohn Laydon</HI> and <HI>Anne Burras</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first marriage in <HI>Virginia.</HI></NOTE> which was the first marriage we had in <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>Long he stayed not, but fitting himselfe and Captaine <HI>Waldo</HI> with two Barges. From <HI>Chawopoweanock,</HI> and all parts thereabouts, all the people were fled, as being iealous of our intents; till we discovered the riv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r and people of <HI>Apamatuck</HI>; where we found not much, that they had we equally divided,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Apamatuck</HI> discovered.</NOTE> but gaue them copper, and such things as contented them in consideration. Master <HI>Scrivener</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Percie</HI> went also abroad, but could find nothing.</P>
<P>The President seeing the procrastinating of time, was no course to liue, resolved with Captaine <HI>Waldo</HI> (whom he knew to be sure in time of need) to surprise <HI>Powha∣tan,</HI> and all his provision, but the vnwillingnesse of Captaine <HI>Winne,</HI> and Master <HI>Scrivener,</HI> for some private respect, plotted in <HI>England</HI> to ruine Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> did their best to hinder their proiect; but the President whom no perswasions could perswade to starue, being invited by <HI>Powhatan</HI> to come vnto him: and if he would send him but men to build him a house, giue him a gryndstone, fiftie swords, some peeces, a cock and a hen, with much copper and beads, he would lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his Ship with Corne. The President not ignorant of his devises and subtiltie, yet vnwilling to neglect any opportunitie, presently sent three <HI>Dutch</HI>-men and two <HI>English,</HI> having so small allowance, few were able to doe any thing to purpose: knowing there nee∣ded no better a Castle to effect this proiect, tooke order with Captaine <HI>Waldo</HI> to se∣cond him, if need required; <HI>Scrivener</HI> he left his substitute, and set forth with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pinnace, two Barges, and fortie-six men, which onely were such as voluntarily of∣fered themselues for his Iourney, the which by reason of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Scriveners</HI> ill successe, was censured very desperate, they all knowing <HI>Smith</HI> would not returne emptie, if it were to be had; howsoever, it caused many of those that he had appointed, to find excuses to stay behinde.</P>

<P>The next night being lodged at <HI>Kecoughtan</HI>; six or seaven dayes the extreame winde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plentie of victualls.</NOTE> rayne, frost and snow caused vs to keepe Christmas among the Salvages, where we were never more merry, nor fed on more plentie of good Oysters, Fish, Flesh, Wild-soule, and good bread; nor never had better fires in <HI>England,</HI> then in the dry, smoaky houses of <HI>Kecoughtan:</HI> but departing thence, when we found no houses we were not curious in any weather to lye three or foure nights together vnder the trees by a fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">148 Foules killed at three shootes.</NOTE> as formerly is sayd. An hundred fortie eight foules the President, <HI>An∣thony Bagnall,</HI> and Serieant <HI>Pising</HI> did kill at three shoots. At <HI>Kiskiack</HI> the frost &amp; con∣trary winds forced vs three or foure dayes also (to suppresse the insolency of those proud Salvages) to quarter in their houses, yet guard our Barge, and cause them giue vs what we wanted; though we were but twelue and himselfe, yet we never wanted shelter where we found any houses. The 12 of Ianuary we arrived at <HI>Wero∣wocomoco,</HI> where the river was frozen neare halfe a myle from the shore; but to neg∣lect
<PB N="75" REF="50"/>
no time, the President with his Barge so far had approached by breaking the ice, as the ebbe left him amongst those oasie shoules, yet rather then to lye there frozē to death, by his owne example he taught them to march neere middle deepe, a flight shot through this muddy frozen oase. When the Barge floated, he appoynted two or three to returne her aboord the Pinnace. Where for want of water in melting the ice, they made fresh water, for the river there was salt. But in this march M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Russell,</HI> (whom none could perswade to stay behinde) being somewhat ill, and exceeding heauie, so overtoyled himselfe as the rest had much adoe (ere he got ashore) to re∣gaine life into his dead benummed spirits. Quartering in the next houses we found, we sent to <HI>Powhatan</HI> for provision, who sent vs plentie of bread, Turkies, and Veni∣son; the next day having feasted vs after his ordinary manner, he began to aske v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when we would be gone: fayning he sent not for vs, neither had he any corne; and his people much lesse: yet for fortie swords he would procure vs fortie Baskets. The President shewing him the men there present that brought him the message and conditions, asked <HI>Powhatan</HI> how it chanced he became so forgetfull; thereat the King concluded the matter with a merry laughter, asking for our Commodities, but none he liked without gunnes and swords, valuing a Basket of Corne more precious then a Basket of Copper; saying he could rate his Corne, but not the Copper.</P>
<P>Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> seeing the intent of this subtill Salvage began to deale with him after this manner. <HI>Powhatan, though I had many courses to haue made my provision,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. <HI>Smiths</HI> discourse to <HI>Powhatan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>yet beleeving your promises to supply my wants, I neglected all to satisfie your desire: and to testi∣fie my loue, I sent you my men for your building, neglecting mine owne. What your people had you haue ingrossed, forbidding them our trade: and now you thinke by consuming the time, we shall consume for want, not having to fulfill your strange demands. As for swords and gunnes, I told you long agoe I had none to spare; and you must know those I haue can keepe me from want: yet steale or wrong you I will not, nor dissolue that friendship we haue mutu∣ally promised, except you constraine me by our bad vsage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The King having attentiuely listned to this Discourse, promised that both he and his Country would spare him what he could, the which within two dayes they should receiue.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Powhatans</HI> re∣ply and flatte∣ry.</NOTE> <HI>Yet Captaine</HI> Smith, <HI>sayth the King, some doubt I haue of your comming hither, that makes me not so kindly seeke to relieue you as I would: for many doe informe me, your comming hi∣ther is not for trade, but to invade my people, and possesse my Country, who dare not come to bring you Corne, seeing you thus armed with your men. To free vs of this feare, leaue aboord your weapons, for here they are ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alesse, we being all friends, and for ever</HI> Powhatans.</P>
<P>With many such discourses they spent the day, quartering that night in the Kings houses. The next day he renewed his building, which hee little intended should proceede. For the <HI>Dutch</HI>-men finding his plentie, and knowing our want, and percei∣ving his preparations to surprise vs, little thinking we could escape both him and fa∣mine; (to obtaine his favour) revealed to him so much as they knew of our estates and proiects, and how to prevent them. One of them being of so great a spirit, iudge∣ment, and resolution, and a hireling that was certaine of his wages for his labour, and ever well vsed both he and his Countrymen; that the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sident knew not whom better to trust; and not knowing any fitter for that imployment, had sent him as a spy to discover <HI>Powhatans</HI> intent, then little doubting his honestie, nor could ever be certaine of his villany till neare halfe a yeare after.</P>
<P>Whilst we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xpected the comming in of the Country, we wrangled out of the King ten quarters of Corne for a copper Kettell, the which the President perceiving him much to affect, valued it at a much greater rate; but in regard of his scarcity he would accept it, provided we should haue as much more the next yeare, or els the Coun∣try of <HI>Monacan.</HI> Wherewith each seemed well contented, and <HI>Powhatan</HI> began to expostulate the difference of Peace and Warre after this manner.</P>

<P>Many other discourses they had, till at last they began to trade.

<P>Then hauing prouided baskets for our men to carry our corne to the boats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pretending to kill our men loaded with baskets, we caused them do it them∣selues.</NOTE> they kindly offered their seruice to guard our Armes, that none should steale them.

But our Bar∣ges being left on the oase by the ebbe, caused vs stay till the next high-water, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that wee returned againe to our old quarter. <HI>Powhatan</HI> and his Dutch-men brusting with desire to haue the head of Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> for if they could but kill him, they thought all was theirs, neglected not any oportunity to effect his purpose. The In∣dians with all the merry sports they could deuise, spent the time till night: then they all returned to <HI>Powhatan,</HI> who all this time was making ready his forces to surprise the house and him at supper. Notwithstanding the eternall all-seeing God did pre∣uent h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and by a strange meanes.

Therefore if we would liue shee wished vs pre∣sently to bee gone. Such things as shee delighted in, he would haue giuen her: but with the teares running downe her cheekes, shee said shee durst not be seene to haue any: for if <HI>Powhatan</HI> should know it, she were but dead, and so shee ranne away by her selfe as she came. Within lesse then an houre came eight or ten lusty fellowes, with great platters of venison and other victuall, very importunate to haue vs put out our matches (whose smoake made them sicke) and sit down to our victuall. But the Captaine made them taste euery dish, which done hee sent some of them backe to <HI>Powhatan,</HI> to bid him make haste for hee was prepared for his comming. As for them hee knew they came to betray him at his supper: but hee would prevent them and all their other intended villanies: so that they might be gone. Not long after came more messengers, to see what newes; not long after them others. Thus wee spent the night as vigilantly as they, till it was high-water, yet seemed to the saluages

<P>Within two or three dayes we arriued at <HI>Pamavnkee,</HI> the King as many dayes en∣tertained vs with feasting and much mirth. And the day appointed to beginne our trade, the President, Lieutenant <HI>Percie,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>West,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Russell,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Behethland,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Crashaw▪</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Powell,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Ford,</HI> and some others to the number of fifteene, went vp to <HI>Opechancanoughs</HI> house a quarter of a mile from the riuer) where wee found no∣thing but a lame fellow and a boy: and all the houses round about of all things aban∣doned. Not long wee stayed ere the King arriued, and after him came diuerse of his people loaden with bowes and arrowes: but such pinching commodities, and those esteemed at such a value, as our Captaine began with the King after this manner.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Smiths</HI> Speech to <HI>Opechanca∣nough.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Opechancanough, the great loue you professe with your tongue, seemes meere deceit by your actions.

<P>The King seemed kindly to accept his offer, and the better to colour his proiect, sold vs what they had to our owne content, promising the next day more company, better prouided. The Barges and Pinnace being committed to the charge of M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Phetiplace</HI>; the President with his old fifteene marched vp to the Kings house, where wee found foure or fiue men newly arriued, each with a great basket.

<P><HI>Worthy Countrey-men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Smiths</HI> speech to his Com∣pany.</NOTE> <HI>were the mischiefes of my seeming friends no more then the danger of these enemies, I little cared were they as many more: if you dare doe, but as I. But this is my torment, that if I escape them, our malicious Councell with their open mouthed Mini∣ons, will make me such a peace breaker (in their opinions in England) as will breake my necke. I could wish those here, that make these seeme Saints, and me an oppressor. But this is the worst of all, wherein I pray you aid mee with your opinions. Should wee beginne with them and surprise the King, we cannot keepe him and defend well our selues. If wee should each kill our man, and so proceed with all in the house; the rest will all fly: then shall wee get no more then the bodies that are slaine, and so starue for victuall. As for their fury it is the least danger, for well you know, being alone assaulted with two or three hundred of them, I made them by the helpe of God compound to saue my life. And wee are sixteene, and they but seauen hundred at the most; and assure your selues, God will so assist vs, that if you dare stand but to discharge your pieces, the very smoake will bee sufficient to affright them. Yet howsoeuer, let vs fight like men, and not die like sheepe: for by that meanes you know God hath oft deliuered mee, and so I trust will now. But first, I will deale with them, to bring it to passe wee may fight for something, and draw them to it by conditions. If you like this motion, promise me you will be valiant.</HI></P>
<P>The time not permitting any argument, all vowed to execute whatsoeuer hee attempted, or die: whereupon the Captaine in plaine tearmes told the King this.</P>

This was to draw him out of the doore, where the bait was guarded with at least two hundred men, and thirty lying vnder a great tree (that lay thwart as a barricado) each his arrow nocked ready to shoot. The President com∣manded one to go see what what kind of deceit this was, and to receiue the present; but hee refused to doe it: yet the Gentlemen and all the rest were importunate to goe, but he would not permit them, being vexed at that Coward: and commanded Lieutenant <HI>Percie,</HI> Master <HI>West,</HI> and the rest to make good the house; Master <HI>Powell</HI> and Master <HI>Behethland</HI> he commanded to guard the doore, and in such a rage snat∣ched the King by his long locke in the middest of his men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Smith</HI> taketh the King pri∣soner.</NOTE> with his Pistoll readie bent against his brest. Thus he led the trembling King, neare dead with feare a∣mongst all his people: who delivering the Captaine his Vambrace, Bow, and Ar∣rowes, all his men were easily intreated to cast downe their Armes, little dreaming any durst in that manner haue vsed their King: who then to escape himselfe be∣stowed his presents in good sadnesse, and causing a great many of them come be∣fore him vnarmed, holding the King by the hayre (as is sayd) he spake to them to this effect.</P>

<P>Vpon this away went their Bowes and Arrowes, and men, women, and children brought in their Commodities:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Salvages dissemble their intent.</NOTE> two or three houres they so thronged about the President and so overwearied him, as he retyred himselfe to rest, leauing M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Beheth∣land</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Powell</HI> to receiue their presents, but some Salvages perceiuing him fast asleepe, &amp; the guard somewhat carelesly dispersed, fortie or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their choi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e men each with a club, or an English sword in his hand began to enter the house with two or three hundred oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, that pressed to second them.

<P>Now in the meane while since our departure, this hapned at our Fort. Master <HI>Scrivener</HI> having receiued Letters from <HI>England</HI> to make himselfe either <HI>Caesar</HI> or no∣thing, he began to decline in his affection to Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> that ever regarded him as himselfe, and was willing to crosse the surprising of <HI>Powhatan</HI>▪ Some certaine daies after the Presidents departure, he would needs goe visit the Isle of Hogs, and tooke with him Captaine <HI>Waldo</HI> (though the President had appointed him to be ready to second his occasions) with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Anthony Gosnoll</HI> and eight others; but so violent was the wind (that extreame frozen time) that the Boat sunke, but where or how none doth know.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The losse of M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Scrivener</HI> and others with a Skiff.</NOTE> The Skiff was much over loaden, and would scarce haue liued in that extreame tempest had she beene empty: but by no perswasion he could be di∣verted, though both <HI>Waldo</HI> and an hundred others doubted as it hapned. The Sal∣vages were the first that round their bodies, which so much the more encouraged them to effect their proiects. To advertise the President of this heavie newes, none could be found would vndertake it, but the Iorney was often refused of all in the Fort, vntill Master <HI>Richard Wyffin</HI> vndertooke alone the performance thereof.</P>
<P>In this Iourney he was incountred with many dangers and difficulties in all parts as he passed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Master <HI>Wyffins</HI> desperate iourney.</NOTE> As for that night he lodged with <HI>Powhatan,</HI> perceiuing such prepara∣tion for warre, not finding the President there: he did assure himselfe some mischiefe was intended. <HI>Pocahontas</HI> hid him for a time, and sent them who pursued him the cleane contrary way to seeke him; but by her meanes and extraordinry bribes and much trouble in three dayes travell, at length he found vs in the middest of these turmoyles.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Powhatan</HI> constraineth his men to be trecherous.</NOTE>Now so extreamely <HI>Powhatan</HI> had threatned the death of his men, if they did not by some meanes kill Captaine <HI>Smith</HI>; that the next day they appointed all the coun∣trey should come to trade vnarmed: yet vnwilling to be trecherous, but that they were constrained, hating fighting with him almost as ill as hanging, such feare they had of bad successe. The next morning the Sunne had not long appeared, but the fields appeared covered with people and Baskets, to tempt vs on shore: but nothing was to be had without his presence, nor they would not indure the sight of a gun.
<PB N="81" REF="53"/>
When the President saw them begin to depart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third at∣tempt to be∣tray vs.</NOTE> being vnwilling to loose such a boo∣tie, he so well conceived the Pinnace, and his Barges with Ambuscadoes, as onely with Lieutenant <HI>Percie,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>West,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Russell,</HI> with their Armes went on shore; others he appointed vnarmed to receiue what was brought. The Salvages flocked before him in heapes, and the banke serving as a
trench for a retreat, he drew them fayre open to his Ambuscado's. For he not being to be perswaded to goe visit their King▪ the King knowing the most of them vnarmed, came to visit him with two or three hundred men, in the forme of two halfe Moones; and with some twentie men, and many women loaden with painted Baskets. But when they approached some∣what neare vs, their women and children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led. For when they had environed and beset the fields in this manner, they thought their purpose sure, yet so trembled with feare as they were scarse able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ck their Arrowes: <HI>Smith</HI> standing with his three men ready bent, beholding them till they were within danger of our Ambuscado's, who vpon the word di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d themselues, and he retyred to the Barge.

<P>That night we sent M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shaw,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ford</HI> to <HI>Iames</HI> towne to Cap. <HI>Winne</HI>▪ In the way betweene <HI>Wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wocomoco</HI> and the Fort they met foure or fiue of the <HI>Dutch</HI>-mens Confederates going to <HI>Powhatan:</HI> the which to excuse those Gentlemens su∣spition of their running to the Salvages, returned to the Fort and there continued.</P>
<P>The Salvages hearing our Barge goe downe the river in the night, were so terri∣bly affrayde, that we sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for more men (we having to much threatned their ruine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A chayne of pearle sent to obtaine peace.</NOTE> and the rasing of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir houses, boats, and wires) that the next day the King sent our Captaine a chayne of Pearle, to alter his purpose and stay his men: promising though they wanted t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emselues, to fraught our ship and bring it aboord to avoyd suspition. So that fiue or six dayes after, from all parts of the Country within ten or twelue myles in the extreame frost and snow, they brought vs provision on their naked backes.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding this kindnesse and trade, had their art and poyson beene suf∣ficient, the President, with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>West,</HI> and some others had beene poysoned;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presi∣dent poyso∣ned: the of∣fend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r puni∣shed.</NOTE> it made them sicke, but exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it selfe. <HI>Wecuttanow,</HI> a stout young fellow, knowing he was suspected for bringing this present of poyson, with fortie or fiftie of his chiefe com∣panions (seeing the President but with a few men at <HI>Potavneak</HI>) so proudly braued it, as though he expected to incounter a revenge. Which the President perceiving in the midst of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> company, did not onely beate, but spurned him like a dogge, as scorning to doe h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m any worse mischiefe. Wherevpon all of them fled into the woods, thinking they had done a great matter to haue so well escaped: and the townsmen remaining presently fraughted our Barge to be rid of our companies, framing many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses to excuse <HI>Wecuttanow,</HI> (being sonne to their chiefe King, but <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hatan</HI>) and told vs if we would shew them him that brought the poyson, they would deliver him to vs to punish as we pleased. Men may thinke it strange there should be such a stirre for a little corne, but had it beene gold with more ease wee might haue got it; and had it wanted, the whole <HI>Colony</HI> had starued. Wee may be thought very patient to endure all those iniuries, yet onely with fearing them wee got what they had. Whereas if we had taken revenge, then by their losse, we should haue lost our selues. We searched also the Countries of <HI>Youghtanund</HI> and <HI>Mattapa∣nient,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Salvages want and po∣vertie.</NOTE> where the people imparted that little they had with such complaints and teares from the eyes of women and children, as he had beene too cruell to haue beene a Christian, that would not haue beene satisfied and moued with compassion.

<P>The maine occasion of our thus temporizing with them was, to part friends as we did, to giue the lesse cause of suspition to <HI>Powhatan</HI> to fly, by whom we now retur∣ned

with a purpose to haue surprised him and his provision. For effecting whereof (when we came against the Towne) the President sent M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Wyffin</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Coe</HI> ashore to discover and make way for his intended proiect. But they found that those dam∣ned <HI>Dutch</HI>-men had caused <HI>Powhatan</HI> to abandon his new house and <HI>Werowocomoco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI>-men did much hurt.</NOTE> and to carry away all his corne and provision: and the people they found so ill affec∣ted, that they were in great doubt how to escape with their liues. So the President finding his intent frustrated, and that there was nothing now to be had, and there∣fore an vnfit time to revenge their abuses, sent Master <HI>Michael Phittiplace</HI> by Land to <HI>Iames</HI> towne, whether we sayled with all the speed we could; wee having in this Iourney (for 25<SUP>•</SUP>. of Copper, and 50<SUP>•</SUP>. of Iron &amp; Beads) enough to keepe 46 men six weekes, and every man for his reward a moneths provision extraordinary (no Trade being allowed but for the store) we got neare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00<SUP>•</SUP> waight of deere suct, and delive∣red to the Cape Merchant 479 Bushels of Corne.</P>
<P>Those temporizing proceedings to some may seeme too charitable, to such a dai∣ly daring trecherous people: to others not pleasing, that we washed not the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und with their blouds, nor shewed such strange inventions in mangling, murdering, ran∣sacking, and destroying (as did the <HI>Spanyards</HI>) the simple bodies of such ignorant soules; nor delightfull, because not stuffed with Relations of heapes and ioynes of gold and silver, nor such rare commodities, as the <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Spany<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds</HI> found in the East and West <HI>Indies.</HI> The want whereof hath begot vs (that were the first vnder∣takers) no lesse sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne and contempt, then the noble conquests and valiant adven∣tures beautified with it, prayse and honour.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. How the <HI>Salvages</HI> became subiect to the <HI>English.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen the Ships departed, all the provision of the Store (but that the Pre∣sident had gotten) was so rotten with the last Summers rayne, and ea∣ten with Rats and Wormes, as the Hogges would scarcely eate it. Yet it was the Souldiers dyet till our returnes, so that we found nothing done, but our victuals spent, and the most part of our tooles, and a good part of our Armes conveyed to the Salvages. But now casting vp the Store, and finding sufficient till the next harvest, the feare of starving was abandoned, and the company divided into tens, fifteens, or as the businesse required; six houres each day was spent in worke, the rest in Pastime and merry exercises, but the vntowardnesse of the greatest num∣ber caused the President advise as followeth.</P>
<P><HI>Countrymen, the long experience of our late miseries,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presi∣dents advice to the Com∣pany.</NOTE> <HI>I hope is sufficient to perswade eve∣ry one to a present correction of himselfe, and thinke not that either my pains, nor the Adven∣turers purses, will ever maintaine you in idlenesse and sloath. I speake not this to you all, for divers of you I know deserue both honour and reward, better then is yet here to be had: but the greater part must be more industrious, or starue, how euer you haue beene heretofore tollerated by the authoritie of the Councell, from that I haue often commanded you. You see now that power resteth wholly in my selfe: you must obey this now for a Law, that he that will not worke shall not eate (except by sicknesse he be disabled:) for the labours of thirtie or fortie honest and industrious men shall not be consumed to maintaine an hundred and fiftie idle loyterers. And though you presume the authoritie here is but a shadow, and that I dare not touch the liues of any but my owne must answer it: the Letters patents shall each weeke be read to you, whose Contents will tell you the contrary. I would wish you therefore without contempt seeke to obserue these orders set downe, for there are now no more Counsellers to protect you, nor curbe my endevours. Therefore he that offendeth, let him assuredly expect his due punishment.</HI></P>
<P>He made also a Table, as a publicke memoriall of every mans deserts, to incourage the good, and with shame to spurre on the rest to amendment. By this many became very industrious, yet more by punishment performed their businesse, for all were so tasked, that there was no excuse could prevaile to deceiue him: yet the <HI>Dutch</HI>-mens consorts so closely convayed them powder, shot, swords, and tooles, that though we could find the defect, we could not finde by whom, till it was too late.</P>
<P>All this time the <HI>Dutch</HI> men remaining with <HI>Powhatan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI>-mens plot to murther Cap. <HI>Smith.</HI></NOTE> (who kindly entertained them to instruct the Salvages the vse of our Armes) and their consorts not following them as they expected; to know the cause, they sent <HI>Francis</HI> their companion, a stout young fellow, disguised like a Salvage, to the Glasse-house, a place in the woods neare a myle from <HI>Iames</HI> Towne; where was their <HI>Rendezvous</HI> for all their vnsus∣pected villany. Fortie men they procured to lie in Ambuscado for Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> who no sooner heard of this <HI>Dutch</HI>-man, but he sent to apprehend him (but he was gone) yet to crosse his returne to <HI>Powhatan,</HI> the Captaine presently dispatched 20.
<PB N="84" REF="55"/>
shot after him, himselfe returning from the Glasse-house alone. By the way he in∣countred the King of <HI>Pasp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hegh,</HI> a most strong stout Salvage, whose perswasions not being able to perswade him to his Ambush, seeing him onely armed but with a fau∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heon,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Smith</HI> taketh the King of <HI>Paspahegh</HI> prisoner.</NOTE> attempted to haue shot him, but the President prevented his shoot by grapling with him, and the Salvage as well prevented him for drawing his faucheon, and per∣force bore him into the River to haue drowned him. Long they strugled in the wa∣ter, till the President got such hold on his throat, he had neare strangled the King; but having drawne his faucheon to cut off his head, seeing how pittifully he begged his life, he led him prisoner to <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, and put him in chaynes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI>-man ere long was also brought in, whose villany though all this time it was suspected, yet he fayned such a formall excuse, that for want of language Cap∣taine <HI>Winne</HI> vnderstood him not rightly, and for their dealings with <HI>Powhatan,</HI> that to saue their liues they were constrained to accommodate his armes, of whom he ex∣treamely complained to haue detained them perforce, and that he made this escape with the hazard of his life, and meant not to haue returned, but was onely walking in the woods to gather Walnuts. Yet for all this faire tale, there was so small appea∣rance of truth, and the plaine confession of <HI>Paspahegh</HI> of his trechery, he went by the heeles: <HI>Smith</HI> purposing to regaine the <HI>Dutch</HI>-men, by the saving his life. The poore Salvage did his best by his daily messengers to <HI>Powhatan,</HI> but all returned that the <HI>Dutch</HI>-men would not returne, neither did <HI>Powhatan</HI> stay them; and to bring them fiftie myles on his mens backes they were not able. Daily this Kings wiues, chil∣dren, and people came to visit him with presents, which he liberally bestowed to make his peace. Much trust they had in the Presidents promise: but the King fin∣ding his guard negligent, though fettered yet escaped. Captaine <HI>Winne</HI> thinking to pursue him found such troupes of Salvages to hinder his passage, as they exchanged many vollies of shot for flights of Arrowes. Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> hearing of this in re∣turning to the Fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. <HI>Smith</HI> taketh two Salvages pri∣soners.</NOTE> tooke two Salvages prisoners, called <HI>Kemps</HI> and <HI>Tussore,</HI> the two most exact villaines in all the Country. With these he sent Captaine <HI>Winne</HI> and fiftie choise men, and Lieutenant <HI>Percie,</HI> to haue regained the King, and revenged this iniury, and so had done, if they had followed his directions, or beene advised with those two villaines, that would haue betrayed both King &amp; kindred for a peece of Copper, but he trifling away the night, the Salvages the next morning by the rising of the Sunne, braved him to come ashore to fight: a good time both sides let fly at other, but we heard of no hurt, onely they tooke two Canowes, burnt the Kings house, and so returned to <HI>Iames</HI> towne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Salvages desire Peace.</NOTE>The President fearing those Bravado's would but incourage the Salvages, began againe himselfe to try his conclusions, whereby six or seauen were slaine, as many made prisoners. He burnt their houses, tooke their Boats, with all their fishing wires, and planted some of them at <HI>Iames</HI> towne for his owne vse, and now resolved not to cease till he had revenged himselfe of all them had iniured him. But in his iourney passing by <HI>Paspahegh</HI> towards <HI>Chickahamania,</HI> the Salvages did their best to draw him to their Ambuscadoes; but seeing him regardlesly passe their Country, all shewed themselues in their bravest manner. To try their valours he could not but let fly, and ere he could land, they no sooner knew him, but they threw downe their armes and desired peace. Their Orator was a lustie young fellow called <HI>Okaning,</HI> whose worthy discourse deserveth to be remembred. And thus it was:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Okaning</HI> his Oration.</NOTE><HI>Captaine</HI> Smith, <HI>my Master is here present in the company, thinking it Capt.</HI> Winne, <HI>and not you, (of him he intended to haue beene revenged) having never offended him. If he hath offended you in escaping your imprisonment, the fishes swim, the foules fly, and the very beasts striue to escape the snare and liue. Then blame not him being a man. He would intreat you remember, you being a prisoner, what paines he tooke to saue your life. If since he hath iniured you he was compelled to it: but howsoeuer, you haue revenged it with our too great losse. We perceive and well know you intend to destroy vs, that are here to intreat and desire your friendship, and to enioy our houses and plant our fields, of whose fruit you shall participate: otherwise you will haue the worse by our absence; for we can plant any where,
<PB N="85" REF="55"/>
though with more labour, and we know you cannot liue if you want our harvest, and that reliefe we bring you. If you promise vs peace, we will beleeue you; if you proceed in revenge we will abandon the Country.</HI></P>
<P>Vpon these tearmes the President promised them peace, till they did vs iniury, vpon condition they should bring in provision. Thus all departed goods friends, and so continued till <HI>Smith</HI> left the Countrey.</P>
<P>Arriving at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, complaint was made to the President,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Salvage smoothered at <HI>Iames</HI> towne, and recove∣red.</NOTE> that the <HI>Chicka∣hamanians,</HI> who all this while continued trade and seemed our friends, by colour thereof were the onely theeues. And amongst other things a Pistoll being stolne and the theefe fled, there was apprehended two proper young fellowes, that were bro∣thers, knowne to be his confederates. Now to regaine this Pistoll, the one was im∣prisoned, the other was sent to returne the Pistoll againe within twelue houres, or his brother to be hanged. Yet the President pittying the poore naked Salvage in the dungeon, sent him victuall and some Char-coale for a fire: ere midnight his bro∣ther returned with the Pistoll, but the poore Salvage in the dungeon was so smoo∣thered with the smoake he had made, and so pittiously burnt, that wee found him dead. The other most lamentably bewayed his death, and broke forth into such bit∣ter agonies, that the President to quiet him, told him that if hereafter they would not steale, he would make him aliue againe: but he little thought he could be reco∣vered. Yet we doing our best with <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> and <HI>Ʋineger,</HI> it pleased God to restore him againe to life, but so drunke &amp; affrighted, that he seemed Lunaticke, the which as much tormented and grieued the other, as before to see him dead. Of which ma∣ladie vpon promise of their good behaviour, the President promised to recover him: and so caused him to be layd by a fire to sleepe, who in the morning having well slept, had recovered his perfect senses, and then being dressed of his burning, and each a peece of Copper giuen them, they went away so well contented, that this was spread among all the Salvages for a miracle, that Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> could make a man aliue that was dead.</P>
<P>Another ingenuous Salvage of <HI>Powhatans,</HI> having gotten a great bag of Powder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two or three Salvages slaine in dry∣ing Powder.</NOTE> and the backe of an Armour, at <HI>Werowocomoco</HI> amongst a many of his companions, to shew his extraordinary skill, he did dry it on the backe as he had seene the Soul∣diers at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne. But he dryed it so long, they peeping over it to see his skill, it tooke fire, and blew him to death, and one or two more, and the rest so scorched, they had little pleasure to meddle any more with powder.</P>
<P>These and many other such pretty Accidents, so amazed and affrighted both <HI>Pow∣hatan,</HI> and all his people, that from all parts with presents they desired peace; retur∣ning many stolne things which we never demanded nor thought of; and after that, those that were taken stealing, both <HI>Powhatan</HI> and his people haue sent them backe to <HI>Iames</HI> towne, to receiue their punishment; and all the Country became absolute as free for vs, as for themselues.</P>

<P>NOw we so quietly followed our businesse, that in three moneths wee made three or foure Last of Tarre, Pitch, and Sope ashes; produced a tryall of Glasse; made a Well in the Fort of excellent sweet water, which till then was wanting; built some twentie houses; recovered our Church; provided Nets and Wires for fishing; and to stop the disorders of our disorderly theeues, and the Salvages, built a Blockhouse in the neck of our Isle, kept by a Garrison to entertaine

the Saluages trade, and none to passe nor repasse Saluage nor Christian without the presidents order. Thirtie or forty Acres of ground we digged and planted. Of three sowes in eighteene moneths, increased 60, and od Piggs. And neere 500. chickings brought vp themselues without hauing any meat giuen them: but the Hogs were transported to Hog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Isle: where also we built a block-house with a garison to giue vs notice of any shipping, and for their exercise they made Clapbord and waynicot, and cut downe trees. We built also a fort for a retreat neere a conuement Riuer vpon a high commanding hill, very hard to be assalted and easie to be defended, but ere it was finished this defect caused a stay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great extre∣mitie by Rats.</NOTE>In searching our casked corne, we found it halfe rotten, and the rest so consumed with so many thousands of Rats that increased so fast, out there originall was from the ships, as we knew not how to keepe that little we had. This did driue vs all to our wits end, for there was nothing in the country but what nature afforded. Vntill this time <HI>Kemps</HI> and <HI>Tassore</HI> were fettered prisoners, and did double taske and taught vs how to order and plant our fields: whom now for want of victuall we set at liberty, but so well they liked our companies they did not desire to goe from vs. And to ex∣presse their loues for 16. dayes continuance, the Countrie people brought vs (when least) 100. a day, of Squirrils, Turkyes, Deere and other wilde beasts: But this want of corne occasioned the end of all our works, it being worke sufficient to provide victu∣all. 60. or 80. with <HI>Ensigne Laxon</HI> was sent downe the riuer to liue vpon Oysters, and 20. with liutenant <HI>Percy</HI> to try for fishing at <HI>Poynt Comfort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> but in six weekes they would not agree once to cast out the net, he being sicke and burnt fore with Gun-pouder. Master <HI>West</HI> with as many went vp to the falls, but nothing could be found but a few Acornes; of that in store euery man had their equall proportion. Till this present, by the hazard and indeuours of some thirtie or fortie, this whole Co∣lony had ever beene fed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bread made of dried Sturge∣on.</NOTE> We had more Sturgeon, then could be deuoured by Dog and Man, of which the industrious by drying and pounding, mingled with Caviar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Sorell and other wholesome hearbes would make bread and good meate: others would gather as much <HI>Tockwhogh</HI> roots, in a day as would make them bread a weeke, so that of those wilde fruites, and what we caught, we liued very well in regard of such a diet, But such was the strange condition of some 150, that had they not beene forced <HI>nolens, volens,</HI> perforce to gather and prepare their victuall they would all haue starued or haue eaten one another. Of those wild fruits the Salvages often brought vs, and for that, the President would not fullfill the vnrea∣sonable desire, of those distracted Gluttonous Loyterers, to sell not only out kettles, hows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their desire to destroy themselues.</NOTE> tooles, and Iron, nay swords, pieces, and the very Ordnance and howses, might they haue prevayled to haue beene but Idle: for those Saluage fruites, they would haue had imparted all to the Saluages, especially for one basket of Corne they heard of to be at <HI>Powhatās,</HI> fifty myles from our Fort. Though he bought neere halfe of it to satisfie their humors, yet to haue had the other halfe, they would haue sould their soules, though not sufficient to haue kept them a weeke. Thou∣sands were there exclamations, suggestions and deuises, to force him to those base inventions to haue made it an occasion to abandon the Country. Want perforce constrained him to indure their exclaiming follies, till he found out the author, one <HI>Dyer</HI> a most crafty fellow and his ancient Maligner, whom he worthily punished, and with the rest he argued the case in this maner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presi∣dents order for the drones</NOTE><HI>Fellow souldiers, I did little thinke any so false to report, or so many to be so simple to be perswaded, that I either intend to starue you, or that</HI> Powhatan <HI>at this present hath corne for himselfe, much lesse for you; or that I would not haue it, if I knew where it were to be had.

The sick shall not starue, but equally share of all our labours; and he that gathereth not every day as much as I doe, the next day shall be set beyond the riuer, and be banished from the Fort as a droue, till he amend his conditions or starue.</HI> But some would say with <HI>Seneca.</HI></P>

With this plot they had acquainted many Discontents, and many were agreed to their Deuilish practise. But one <HI>Thomas Douse,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Mallard</HI> (whose christian hearts relented at such an vnchristian act) voluntarily reuealed it to Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> who caused them to conceale it, perswading <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse</HI> and <HI>Mallard</HI> to proceed in their con∣fedracie: onely to bring the irreclamable <HI>Dutch</HI> men and the inconstant Salvages in such a maner amongst such Ambuscado's as he had prepared▪ that not many of thē should returne from our <HI>Peninsula.</HI> But this brute cōming to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ares of the impatiēt multitude they so importuned the President to cut off those <HI>Dutch</HI> men, as amongst many that offred to cut their throats bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the face of <HI>Powhatā,</HI> the first was Lieutenāt <HI>Percy,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Iohn Cuderington,</HI> two Gentlemen of as bold resolute spirits as could possibly be foūd.

<P>By this you may see for all those crosses, trecheries, and dissentions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note these in∣conveniences.</NOTE> how hee wrestled and overcame (without bloudshed) all that happened: also what good was done; how few dyed; what food the Countrey naturally affoordeth; what small cause there is men should starue, or be murthered by the Salvages, that haue discretion to mannage them with courage and industrie. The two first yeares, though by his adventures, he had oft brought the Salvages to a tractable trade, yet you see how the envious authoritie ever crossed him, and frustrated his best ende∣vours. But it wrought in him that experience and estimation amongst the Salvages, as otherwise it had bin impossible, he had ever effected that he did. Notwithstanding the many miserable, yet generous and worthy adventures, he had oft and long en∣dured in the wide world, yet in this case he was againe to learne his Lecture by ex∣perience. Which with thus much adoe having obtained, it was his ill chance to end, when he had but onely learned how to begin. And though he left those vn∣knowne difficulties (made easie and familiar) to his vnlawfull successors, (who onely by liuing in <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, presumed to know more then all the world could direct them:) Now though they had all his Souldiers, with a tripple power, and twice tripple better meanes; by what they haue done in his absence, the world may see what they would haue done in his presence, had he not prevented their indis∣cretions: it doth iustly proue, what cause he had to send them for <HI>England,</HI> and that he was neither factious, mutinous, nor dishonest. But they haue made it more plaine since his returne for <HI>England</HI>; having his absolute authoritie freely in their power, with all the advantages and opportunitie that his labours had effected. As I am sorry their actions haue made it so manifest, so I am vnwilling to say what rea∣son doth compell me, but onely to make apparant the truth, least I should seeme partiall, reasonlesse, and malicious.</P>

<P>For remedie whereof he presently sent to <HI>Powhatan</HI> to sell him the place called <HI>Powhatan,</HI> promising to defend him against the <HI>Monacans.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Powhatan</HI> bought for Copper.</NOTE> And these should be his Conditions (with his people) to resigne him the Fort and houses, and all that Countrey for a proportion of Copper; that all stealing offenders should be sent him, thereto receiue their punishment; that every house as a Custome should pay him a Bushell of Corne for an inch square of Copper, and a proportion of <HI>Pocones,</HI> as a yearely tribute to King <HI>Iames</HI> for their protection, as a dutie; what else they could spare to barter at their best discretions.</P>
<P>But both this excellent place and those good Conditions did those furies refuse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> contemning both him, his kinde care and authoritie. So much they depended on the Lord Generals new Commission, as they regarded none: the worst they could doe to shew their spights they did; supposing all the <HI>Monacans</HI> Country, gold; and none should come there but whom they pleased. I doe more then wonder to thinke how onely with fiue men, he either durst or would adventure as he did, (knowing how greedie they were of his bloud) to land amongst them, and commit to impri∣sonment all the Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ftaines of those mutinies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiue suppresse an hundred and twentie.</NOTE> till by their multitudes being an hundred and twentie they forced him to retyre: yet in that interim he surprised one of their Boates, wherewith he returned to their ship; where in deed was their proui∣sion, which also he tooke, and well it chanced he found the Marriners so tractable and constant, or there had beene small possibilitie he had ever escaped. There were divers other of better reason and experience, that from their first landing, hearing the generall good report of his old Souldiers, and seeing with their eyes his actions so well mannaged with discretion, as Captaine <HI>Wood,</HI> Captaine <HI>Webbe,</HI> Cap. <HI>Moone,</HI> Captaine <HI>Fitz Iames,</HI> Master <HI>William Powell,</HI> Master <HI>Partridge,</HI> Master <HI>White,</HI> and divers others, when they perceiued the malice of <HI>Ratliffe</HI> and <HI>Archer,</HI> and their fac∣tion, left their companies, and ever rested his faithfull friends. But the worst was that the poore Salvages, that daily brought in their contribution to the President,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breach of peace with the Salvage at the Falle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> that disorderly company so tormented those poore soules, by stealing their corne, robbing their gardens, beating them, breaking their houses and keeping some pri∣soners; that they daily complained to Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> he had brought them for Protectors, worse enemies then the <HI>Monacans</HI> themselues: which though till then, for his loue they had endured, they desired pardon if hereafter they defended them∣selues; since he would not correct them, as they had long expected he would. So
<PB N="92" REF="59"/>
much they importuned him to punish their misdemeanors, as they offered (if he would leade them) to fight for him against them. But having spent nine dayes in seeking to reclaime them; shewing them how much they did abuse themselues with these great guilded hopes of the South Sea Mines, commodities, or victories, they so madly conceived; then seeing nothing would prevaile, he set sayle for <HI>Iames</HI> Towne.</P>
<LG>
<L>Thus oft we see from small greene wounds, and from a little griefe,</L>
<L>A greater sore and sicknesse growes, then will admit reliefe:</L>
<L>For thus themselues they did be guile, and with the rest play'd theefe.</L>
</LG>
<P>Now no sooner was the Ship vnder sayle, but the Salvages assaulted those hun∣dred and twentie in their Fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An assalt by the Salvages</NOTE> finding some stragling abroad in the woods: they slew many, and so affrighted the rest, as their prisoners escaped, and they safely re∣tyred, with the swords and cloakes of those they had slaine. But ere wee had sayled halfe a league, our ship grounding, gaue vs once more libertie to summon them to a parley; where we found them all so strangely amazed with this poore silly assault of twelue Saluages, that they submitted themselues vpon any tearmes to the Presi∣dents mercy; who presently put by the heeles sixe or seauen of the chiefe offenders: the rest he seated gallantly at <HI>Powhatan,</HI> in that Salvage Fort, readie built, and pret∣tily fortified with poles and barkes of trees, sufficient to haue defended them from all the Salvages in <HI>Virginia,</HI> dry houses for lodgings and neere two hundred ac∣cres of ground ready to be planted, and no place we knew so strong, so pleasant and delightfull in <HI>Virginia</HI> for which we called it <HI>Non-such.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The planting of <HI>Non-such.</HI></NOTE> The Salvages also hee presently appeased, redeliuering to either party their former losses. Thus all were friends.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Salvages appeased.</NOTE>New officers appointed to command, and the President againe ready to depart, at that instant arriued Captaine <HI>West,</HI> whose gentle nature (by the perswasi∣ons and compassion of those mutinous prisoners, alledging they had onely done this for his honor) was so much abused, that to regaine their old hopes, new tur∣boyles did arise. For they a-shore being possessed of all there victuall, munition, and euery thing, grew to that height in their former factions, as the President left them to their fortunes: they returned againe to the open ayre at <HI>Wests</HI> Fort, a∣bandoning <HI>Non such,</HI> and he to <HI>Iames</HI> towne with his best expedition, but this hap∣ned him in that Iourney.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> blowne vp with pow∣der.</NOTE>Sleeping in his Boate, (for the ship was returned two daies before) accidentallie, one fired his powder-bag, which tore the flesh from his body and thighes, nine or ten inches square in a most pittifull manner; but to quench the tormenting fire, frying him in his cloaths he leaped over-boord into the deepe river, where ere they could recouer him he was neere drowned. In this estate without either Chirurgi∣an, or Chirurgery he was to goe neere an hundred myles. Arriving at <HI>Iames</HI> towne, causing all things to be prepared for peace or warres to obtaine provision, whilest those things were providing, <HI>Ratliffe, Archer,</HI> &amp; the rest of their Confederates, being to come to their trials; their guiltie consciences, fearing a iust reward for their de∣serts, seeing the President, vnable to stand, and neere berest of his senses by reason of his torment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bloudy intent.</NOTE> they had plotted to haue murdered him in his bed. But his heart did faile him that should haue giuen fire to that mercilesse Pistoll. So not fin∣ding that course to be the best, they ioyned together to vsurpe the government, thereby to escape their punishment. The President, had notice of their proiects, the which to withstand, though his old souldiers importuned him but permit them to take their heads that would resist his command, yet he would not suffer them, but sent for the Masters of the ships, and tooke order with them for his returne for England.

new commission granted they knew not to whom (the which disabled that authori∣ty he had, as made them presume so oft to those mutinies as they did:) besides so grievous were his wounds, and so cruell his torments (few expecting he could liue) nor was hee able to follow his busines to regaine what they had lost, suppresse those factions, and range the countries for provision as he intended; and well he knew in those affaires his owne actions and presence was as requisit as his directions, which now could not be, he went presently abroad, resoluing there to appoint them governours, and to take order for the mutiners, but he could finde none hee thought fit for it would accept it. In the meane time, seeing him gone, they perswa∣ded Master <HI>Percy</HI> to stay, who was then to goe for England, and be their President. Within lesse then an houre was this mutation begun and concluded. For when the Company vnderstood <HI>Smith</HI> would leaue them, &amp; saw the rest in Armes called Pre∣sidents &amp; Councellors, divers began to fawne on those new commanders, that now bent all their wits to get him resigne them his Commission: who after much adoe and many bitter repulses; that their confusion (which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould them was at their elbowes) should not be attributed to him, for leauing the Colony without a Com∣mission, he was not vnwilling they should steale it, but never would he giue it to such as they.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>And thus,</HI> Strange violent forces drew vs on vnwilling:</L>
<L>Reason perswading 'gainst our loues rebelling.</L>
<L>We saw and knew the better, ah curse accurst!</L>
<L>That notwithstanding we imbrace the worst.</L>
</LG>
<P>But had that vnhappie blast not hapned, he would quickly haue qualified the heate of those humors, and factions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The causes why <HI>Smith</HI> left the Coun∣trey and his Commission.</NOTE> had the ships but once left them and vs to our fortunes; and haue made that provision from among the Salvages, as we neither feared <HI>Spanyard,</HI> Salvage, nor famine; nor would haue left <HI>Virginia,</HI> nor our lawfull authoritie, but at as deare a price as we had bought it, and payd for it. What shall I say but thus, we left him, that in all his proceedings, made Iustice his first guide, and experience his second, even hating basenesse, sloath, pride, and indignitie, more then any dangers; that neuer allowed more for himselfe, then his souldiers with him; that vpon no danger would send them where he would not lead them him∣selfe; that would never see vs want, what he either had, or could by any meanes get vs; that would rather want then borrow, or starue then not pay; that loued ac∣tion more then words, and hated falshood and covetousnesse worse then death; whose adventures were our liues, and whose losse our deaths.</P>
<P>Leaving vs thus with three ships, seaven boats, commodities readie to trade, the harvest newly gathered, ten weeks provision in the store, foure hundred nintie and od persons, twentie-foure Peeces of Ordnance, three hundred Muskets, Snaphan∣ces, and Firelockes, Shot, Powder, and Match sufficient, Curats, Pikes, Swords, and Morrios, more then men; the Salvages, their language, and habitations well knowne to an hundred well trayned and expert Souldiers; Nets for fishing; Tooles of all sorts to worke; apparell to supply our wants; six Mares and a Horse; fiue or sixe hundred Swine; as many Hennes and Chickens; some Goats; some sheepe; what was brought or bred there remained. But they regarding nothing but from hand to mouth, did consume that wee had, tooke care for nothing, but to perfect some colourable complaints against Captaine <HI>Smith.</HI> For effecting whereof three weekes longer they stayed the Ships, till they could produce them. That time and charge might much better haue beene spent, but it suted well with the rest of their dis∣cretions.</P>
<P>Besides <HI>Iames</HI> towne that was strongly Pallizadoed, containing some fiftie or six∣tie houses, he left fiue or sixe other severall Forts and Plantations: though they were not so sumptuous as our successors expected, they were better then they provided any for vs. All this time we had but one Carpenter in the Countrey, and three o∣thers
<PB N="94" REF="60"/>
that could doe little, but desired to be learners: two Blacksmiths; two saylers, &amp; those we write labourers were for most part footmen, and such as they that were Adventurers brought to attend them, or such as they could perswade to goe with them, that neuer did know what a dayes worke was, except the <HI>Dutch</HI>-men and <HI>Poles,</HI> and some dozen other. For all the rest were poore Gentlemen, Tradsmen, Serving-men, libertines, and such like, ten times more fit to spoyle a Common-wealth, then either begin one, or but helpe to maintaine one. For when neither the feare of God, nor the law, nor shame, nor displeasure of their friends could rule them here, there is small hope ever to bring one in twentie of them ever to be good there. Notwithstanding, I confesse divers amongst them, had better mindes and grew much more industrious then was expected: yet ten good workemen would haue done more substantiall worke in a day, then ten of them in a weeke. Therefore men may rather wonder how we could doe so much, then vse vs so badly, because we did no more, but leaue those examples to make others beware, and the fruits of all, we know not for whom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ends of the <HI>Dutch</HI>-men.</NOTE>But to see the justice of God vpon these <HI>Dutch</HI>-men; <HI>Ʋaldo</HI> before spoke of, made a shift to get for <HI>England,</HI> where perswading the Merchants what rich Mines he had found, and great service he would doe them, was very well rewarded, and returned with the Lord <HI>La Warre</HI>: but being found a meere Impostor, he dyed most misera∣bly. <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Francis</HI> his two consorts were fled againe to <HI>Powhatan,</HI> to whom they promised at the arrivall of my Lord, what wonders they would doe, would he suffer them but to goe to him. But the King seeing they would be gone, replyed; You that would haue betrayed Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> to mee, will certainely betray me to this great Lord for your peace: so caused his men to beat out their braines.</P>
<P>To conclude, the greatest honour that ever belonged to the greatest Monarkes, was the inlarging their Dominions, and erecting Common-weales. Yet howsoever any of them haue attributed to themselues, the Conquerors of the world: there is more of the world never heard of them, then ever any of them all had in subiecti∣on: for the <HI>Medes, Persians,</HI> and <HI>Assyrians,</HI> never Conquered all <HI>Asia,</HI> nor the <HI>Gre∣cians</HI> but part of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> indeed had a great part of both, as well as <HI>Affrica</HI>: but as for all the Northerne parts of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> the interior Southern and Westerne parts of <HI>Affrica,</HI> all <HI>America</HI> &amp; <HI>Terra incognita,</HI> they were all ignorant: nor is our knowledge yet but superficiall. That their beginnings, ending, and limi∣tations were proportioned by the Almightie is most evident: but to consider of what small meanes many of them haue begun is wonderfull. For some write that e∣ven <HI>Rome</HI> her selfe, during the Raigne of <HI>Romulus,</HI> exceeded not the number of a thousand houses. And <HI>Carthage</HI> grew so great a Potentate, that at first was but incir∣culed in the thongs of a Bulls skinne, as to fight with <HI>Rome</HI> for the Empire of the world. Yea <HI>Venice</HI> at this time the admiration of the earth, was at first but a Marish, in∣habited by poore Fishermen. And likewise <HI>Ninivie, Thebes, Babylon, Delus, Troy, A∣thens, Mycena</HI> and <HI>Sparta,</HI> grew from small beginnings to be most famous States, though now they retaine little more then a naked name. Now this our yong Com∣mon-wealth in <HI>Virginia,</HI> as you haue read once consisted but of 38 persons, and in two yeares increased but to 200. yet by this small meanes so highly was approved the Plantation in <HI>Virginia,</HI> as how many Lords, with worthy Knights, and braue Gentlemen pretended to see it, and some did, and now after the expence of fifteene yeares more, and such massie summes of men and money, grow they disanimated? If we truely consider our Proceedings with the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> and the rest, we haue no reason to despayre, for with so small charge, they never had either greater Discove∣ries, with such certaine tryals of more severall Commodities, then in this short time hath beene returned from <HI>Ʋirginia,</HI> and by much lesse meanes. <HI>New England</HI> was brought out of obscuritie, and affoorded fraught for neare 200 sayle of ships, where there is now erected a braue Plantation. For the happines of <HI>Summer Isles,</HI> they are no lesse then either, and yet those haue had a far lesse, and a more difficult begin∣ning, then either <HI>Rome, Carthage,</HI> or <HI>Ʋenice.</HI></P>

Now wee were all constrained to liue onely on that <HI>Smith</HI> had onely for his owne Companie, for the rest had consumed their proportions, and now they had twentie Presidents with all their appurtenances: Master <HI>Piercie</HI> our new President, was so sicke hee could neither goe nor stand. But ere all was consumed, Captaine <HI>West</HI> and Captaine <HI>Sickelmore,</HI> each with a small ship and thirtie or fortie men well appointed, sought abroad to trade. <HI>Sickelmore</HI> vpon the confidence of <HI>Powhatan,</HI> with about thirtie others as carelesse as himselfe, were all slaine, onely <HI>Ieffrey Shortridge</HI> escaped, and <HI>Pokahontas</HI> the Kings daughter saued a boy called <HI>Henry Spilman,</HI> that liued many yeeres after, by her meanes, a∣mongst the <HI>Patawomekes. Powhatan</HI> still as he found meanes, cut off their Boats, denied them trade, so that Captaine <HI>West</HI> set saile for <HI>England.</HI> Now we all found the losse of Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> yea his greatest maligners could now curse his losse: as for corne, prouision and contribution from the Saluages, we had nothing but mortall wounds, with clubs and arrowes; as for our Hogs, Hens, Goats, Sheepe, Horse, or what liued, our commanders, officers &amp; Saluages daily consumed them, some small proportions sometimes we tasted, till all was deuoured; then swords, armes, pieces, or any thing, wee traded with the Saluages, whose cruell fingers were so oft imbrewed in our blouds, that what by their crueltie, our Gouernours indiscretion, and the losse of our ships, of fiue hundred within six moneths after Captaine <HI>Smiths</HI> departure, there remained not past sixtie men, women and children, most miserable and poore creatures; and those were preserued for the most part, by roots, herbes, acornes, walnuts, berries, now and then a little fish: they that had startch in these extremities, made no small vse of it; yea, euen the very skinnes of our horses. Nay, so great was our famine, that a Saluage we slew, and buried, the poorer sort tooke him vp againe and eat him, and so did diuers

one another boyled and stewed with roots and herbs: And one amongst the rest did kill his wife, powdered her, and had eaten part of her before it was knowne, for which hee was executed, as hee well deserued; now whether shee was better roasted, boyled or carbonado'd, I know not, but of such a dish as powdered wise I neuer heard of. This was that time, which still to this day we called the staruing time; it were too vile to say, and scarce to be beleeued, what we endured: but the occasion was our owne, for want of prouidence, industrie and gouernment, and not the barrennesse and defect of the Countrie, as is generally supposed; for till then in three yeeres, for the numbers were landed vs, we had neuer from <HI>England</HI> prouision sufficient for six moneths, though it seemed by the bils of loading suffi∣cient was sent vs, such a glutton is the Sea, and such good fellowes the Mariners; we as little tasted of the great proportion sent vs, as they of our want and mise∣ries, yet notwithstanding they euer ouer-swayed and ruled the businesse, though we endured all that is said, and chiefly liued on what this good Countrie naturally afforded; yet had wee beene euen in Paradice it selfe with these Gouernours, it would not haue beene much better with vs; yet there was amongst vs, who had they had the gouernment as Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> appointed, but that they could not maintaine it, would surely haue kept vs from those extremities of miseries.

</LG>
<P>The Lord Gouernour, after mature deliberation, deliuered some few words to the Companie, laying iust blame vpon them, for their haughtie vanities and slug∣gish idlenesse, earnestly intreating them to amend those desperate follies, lest hee should be compelled to draw the sword of Iustice, and to cut off such delinquents, which he had rather draw, to the shedding of his vitall bloud, to protect them from iniuries; heartning them with relation of that store hee had brought with him, constituting officers of all conditions, to rule ouer them, allotting euery man his particular place, to watch vigilantly, and worke painfully: This Oration and direction being receiued with a generall applause, you might shortly behold the idle and restie diseases of a diuided multitude, by the vnitie and authoritie of this gouernment to be substantially cured. Those that knew not the way to good∣nesse before, but cherished singularitie and faction, can now chalke out the path of all respectiue dutie and seruice: euery man endeuoureth to outstrip other in diligence: the <HI>French</HI> preparing to plant the Vines, the <HI>English</HI> labouring in the Woods and grounds; euery man knoweth his charge, and dischargeth the same with alacritie. Neither let any man be discouraged, by the relation of their daily labour (as though the sap of their bodies should bee spent for other mens profit) the setled times of working, to effect all themselues, or as the Aduenturers need desire, required no more paines than from six of the clocke in the morning, vn∣till ten, and from two in the afternoone, till foure, at both which times they are prouided of spirituall and corporall reliefe. First, they enter into the Church, and make their praiers vnto God, next they returne to their houses and receiue their proportion of food. Nor should it bee conceiued that this businesse exclu∣deth Gentlemen, whose breeding neuer knew what a daies labour meant, for though they cannot digge, vse the Spade, nor practice the Axe, yet may the stai∣ed spirits of any condition, finde how to imploy the force of knowledge, the ex∣ercise of counsell, the operation and power of their best breeding and qualities. The houses which are built, are as warme and defensiue against wind and

Our forces are now such as are able to tame the furie and trecherie of the Saluages: Our Forts assure the Inhabitants, and frustrate all assaylants. And to leaue no discouragement in the heart of any, who personally shall enter into this great action, I will communicate a double com∣fort; first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>George Som∣mers</HI> returne to the <HI>Bermudas.</HI></NOTE> Sir <HI>George Sommers,</HI> that worthy Admirall hath vndertaken a dange∣rous aduenture for the good of the Colonie.</P>
<P>Vpon the 15. of Iune, accompanied with Captaine <HI>Samuel Argall,</HI> hee retur∣ned in two Pinaces vnto the <HI>Bermudas,</HI> promising (if by any meanes God will open a way to that Iland of Rocks) that he would soone returne with six moneths prouision of flesh; with much crosse weather at last hee there safely arriued, but Captaine <HI>Argall</HI> was forced backe againe to <HI>Iames</HI> towne, whom the Lord <HI>De la Ware</HI> not long after sent to the Riuer of <HI>Patawomeke,</HI> to trade for Corne; where finding an <HI>English</HI> boy, one <HI>Henry Spilman,</HI> a young Gentleman well descended, by those people preserued from the furie of <HI>Powhatan,</HI> by his acquaintance had such good vsage of those kinde Saluages, that they fraughted his ship with Corne, wherewith he returned to <HI>Iames</HI> towne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The building Fort <HI>Henry</HI> and Fort <HI>Charles.</HI></NOTE>The other comfort is, that the Lord <HI>la Ware</HI> hath built two new Forts, the one called Fort <HI>Henry,</HI> the other Fort <HI>Charles,</HI> in honour of our most noble Prince, and his hopefull brother, vpon a pleasant plaine, and neare a little Riuilet they call <HI>Southampton</HI> Riuer; they stand in a wholsome aire, hauing plentie of Springs of sweet water, they command a great circuit of ground, containing Wood, Pa∣sture and Marsh, with apt places for Vines, Corne and Gardens; in which Forts it is resolued, that all those that come out of <HI>England,</HI> shall be at their first landing quartered, that the wearisomnesse of the Sea, may bee refreshed in this pleasing part of the Countrie, and Sir <HI>Thomas Gates</HI> hee sent for <HI>England.</HI> But to correct some iniuries of the <HI>Paspahegs,</HI> he sent Captaine <HI>Pearcie,</HI> Master <HI>Stacy,</HI> and fiftie or threescore shot, where the Saluages flying, they burnt their houses, tooke the Queene and her children prisoners, whom not long after they slew.</P>
<P>The fertilitie of the soile, the temperature of the climate, the forme of gouern∣ment, the condition of our people, their daily inuocating of the Name of God being thus expressed; why should the successe, by the rules of mortall iudgement, bee disparaged? why should not the rich haruest of our hopes be seasonably expe∣cted?

<P>But his Lordship being at the fales, the Saluages assaulted his troopes and slew three or foure of his men. Not long after, his Honour growing very sicke, he re∣turned for <HI>England</HI> the 28. of March; in the ship were about fiue and fiftie men, but ere we arriued at <HI>Fyall,</HI> fortie of vs were neare sicke to death, of the Scuruie, Callenture, and other diseases: the Gouernour being an <HI>English-man,</HI> kindly vsed vs, but small reliefe we could get, but Oranges, of which we had plenty, whereby within eight daies wee recouered, and all were well and strong by that they came into <HI>England.

<P>The Counsell of <HI>Virginia</HI> finding the smalnesse of that returne which they hoped should haue defrayed the charge of a new supply, entred into a deep con∣sultation, whether it were fit to enter into a new Contribution, or in time to send for them home, and giue ouer the action, and therefore they adiured Sir <HI>Thomas Gates</HI> to deale plainly with them, who with a solemne and a sacred oath replyed, That all things before reported were true, and that all men know that wee stand at the deuotion of politicke Princes and States, who for their proper vtilitie, de∣uise all courses to grind our Merchants, and by all pretences to confiscate their goods, and to draw from vs all manner of gaine by their inquisitiue inuentions, when in <HI>Virginia,</HI> a few yeeres labour by planting and husbandry, will furnish all

<P>In these extremities I resolued to consult with my friends, who finding nature spent in me, and my body almost consumed, my paines likewise daily increasing, gaue me aduice to preferre a hopefull recouerie, before an assured ruine, which must necessarily haue ensued, had I liued but twentie daies longer in <HI>Virginia,</HI> wanting at that instant both food and Physicke, fit to remedie such extraordinary diseases; wherefore I shipped my selfe with Doctor <HI>Bohun</HI> and Captaine <HI>Argall,</HI> for <HI>Meuis</HI> in the West <HI>Indies,</HI> but being crossed with Southerly winds, I was for∣ced to shape my course for the Westerne Iles, where I found helpe for my health, and my sicknesse asswaged, by the meanes of fresh dyet, especially Oranges and Limons, and vndoubted remedie for that disease: then I intended to haue re∣turned backe againe to <HI>Virginia,</HI> but I was aduised not to hazard my selfe, be∣fore I had perfectly recouered my strength: so I came for <HI>England</HI>; in which accident, I doubt not but men of iudgement will imagine, there would more preiudice haue happened by my death there, than I hope can doe by my returne.</P>

Doe they not wilfully hide their talents, or keepe themselues at home, for feare of losing a few pleasures: be there not any among them of <HI>Moses</HI> his minde, and of the Apostles, that forsooke all to follow Christ, but I refer them to the Iudge of all hearts, and to the King that shall reward euery one according to his talent. <HI>From Virginia.

<P>The businesse being brought to this perfection, Captaine <HI>Arga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> returned for <HI>England,</HI> in the latter end of <HI>Iune,</HI> 1614. ariuing in <HI>England,</HI> and bringing this good tidings to the Councell and company by the assistances of Sir <HI>Thomas Gates,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t also had returned from <HI>Ʋirginia</HI> but the March before; it was presently concluded, that to supply this good successe with all expedition, the standing Lottery should be drawne with all diligent conueniency, and that posterity may remember vpon occasion to vse the like according to the declaration, I thinke it not amisse to remember thus much.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1615"/> IT is apparent to the world; by how many former Proclamations, we manifest∣ed our intents, to haue drawn out the great standing Lottery long before this,<NOTE PLACE="marg"> Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> Treasurer.</NOTE> which not falling out as we desired, and others expected, whose monies are aduentured ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, we thought good therefore for the auoiding all vniust and sinister constructions, to resolue the doubts of all indifferent minded, in three speciall points for their better satisfaction.</P>
<P>But ere I goe any farther, let vs remember there was a running Lottery, vsed a long time in Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> Church-yard, where this stood, that brought into the Treasury good summes of mony dayly, though the Lot was but small.</P>
<P>Now for the points, the first is, for as much as the Aduenturers came in so slackly for the yeere past, without preiudice to the generality, in losing the blankes and prises, we were forced to petition to the honourable Lords, who out of their noble care to further this Plantation, haue recommended their Let∣ters to the Countries, Cities, and good townes in <HI>England,</HI> which we hope by sending in their voluntary Aduenturers, will sufficiently supply vs.</P>
<P>The second for satisfaction to all honest well affected minds, is, that though this expectation answer not our hopes, yet wee haue not failed in our Christian care, the good of that Colony, to whom we haue lately sent two sundry sup∣plies, and were they but now supplied with more hands, wee should soone resolue the diuision of the Country by Lot, and so lessen the generall charge.</P>
<P>The third is our constant resolution, that seeing our credits are so farre ingaged

to the honourable Lords and the whole State, for the drawing this great Lottery, which we intend shall be without delay, the 26. of Iune next, desiring all such as haue vndertaken with bookes to solicit their friends, that they will not with-hold their monies till the last moneth be expired, lest we be vnwillingly for∣ced to proportion a lesse value and number of our Blankes and Prises which here∣after followeth.</P>

<P>This deare bought Land with so much bloud and cost, hath onely made some few rich, and all the rest losers.

<P><MILESTONE N="1618"/><NOTE PLACE="marg"> Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> Treasurer.</NOTE>This yeere hauing planted our fields, came a great drought, and such a cruell storme of haile, which did such spoile both to the Corne and Tobacco, that wee reaped but small profit, the Magazine that came in the <HI>George,</HI> being fiue mo∣neths in her passage, proued very badly conditioned, but ere sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> arriued, we had gathered and made vp our Tobacco, the best at three shillings the pound, the rest at eighteene pence.</P>
<P>To supply vs, the Councell and Company with all possible care and diligence, furnished a good ship of some two hundred and fiftie tunne, with two hundred people and the Lord <HI>la Ware.</HI> They set saile in Aprill, and tooke their course by the westerne Iles, where the Gouernour of the Ile of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> receiued the Lord <HI>la Ware,</HI> and honourably feasted him, with all the content hee could giue him. Going from thence, they were long troubled with contrary winds, in which time many of them fell very sicke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of the Lord <HI>la Ware.</HI></NOTE> thirtie died, one of which number was that most honourable Lord Gouernour the Lord <HI>la Ware,</HI> whose most noble and generous disposition, is well knowne to his great cost, had beene most forward in this businesse for his Countries good: Yet this tender state of <HI>Ʋirginia</HI> was not growne to that maturitie, to maintaine such state and pleasure as was fit for such a personage, with so braue and great attendance: for some small number of ad∣uentrous Gentlemen to make discoueries, and lie in Garrison, ready vpon any occasion to keepe in feare the inconstant Saluages, nothing were more requisite, but to haue more to wait &amp; play than worke, or more commanders and officers than industrious labourers was not so necessarie: for in <HI>Virginia,</HI> a plaine Soul∣dier that can vse a Pick-axe and spade, is better than fiue Knights, although they were Knights that could breake a Lance; for men of great place, not inured to those incounters; when they finde things not sutable, grow many times so dis∣contented, they forget themselues, &amp; oft become so carelesse, that a discontented melancholy brings them to much sorrow, and to others much miserie. At last they stood in for the coast of <HI>New-England,</HI> where they met a small Frenchman, rich of Beuers and other Furres. Though wee had here but small knowledge of the coast nor countrie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are relie∣ued in <HI>New-Eng∣land.</HI></NOTE> yet they tooke such an abundance of Fish and Fowle, and so well refreshed themselues there with wood and water, as by the helpe of God thereby, hauing beene at Sea sixteene weekes, got to <HI>Virginia,</HI> who without this reliefe had beene in great danger to perish. The French-men made them such a feast, with such an abundance of varietie of Fish, Fowle and Fruits, as they all ad∣mired, and little expected that wild wildernesse could affoord such wonderfull abundance of plentie. In this ship came about two hundred men, but very little prouision, and the ship called the <HI>Treasurer</HI> came in againe not long after with fortie passengers; the Lord <HI>la Wares</HI> ship lying in <HI>Ʋirginia</HI> three moneths, wee victualled her with threescore bushels of Corne, and eight Hogsheads of flesh, besides other victuall she spent whilest they tarried there: this ship brought vs ad∣uice that great multitudes were a preparing in <HI>England</HI> to bee sent, and relied much vpon that victuall they should finde here: whereupon our Captaine called a Councell, and writ to the Councell here in <HI>England</HI> the estate of the Colonie, and what a great miserie would insue, if they sent not prouision as well as people; and what they did suffer for want of skilfull husbandmen, and meanes to set their Ploughs on worke, hauing as good ground as any man can desire, and about fortie Bulls and Oxen, but they wanted men to bring them to la∣bour, and Irons for the Ploughs, and harnesse for the Cattell. Some thirtie or fortie acres wee had sowne with one Plough, but it stood so long on the ground before it was reaped, it was most shaken, and the rest spoiled with the

<P>FOr to begin with the yeere of our Lord, 1619. there arriued a little Pinnace priuatly from <HI>England</HI> about Easter for Captaine <HI>Argall,</HI> who taking order for his affaires, within foure or fiue daies returned in her, and left for his Deputy, Captaine <HI>Nathaniel Powell.</HI> On the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighteenth of <HI>Aprill,</HI> which was but ten or twelue daies after, arriued Sir <HI>George Yearley,</HI> by whom we vnder∣stood Sir <HI>Edwin Sands</HI> was chosen Treasurer, and Master <HI>Iohn Farrar</HI> his Deputy, and what great supplies was a preparing to be sent vs, which did rauish vs so much with ioy and content, we thought our selues now fully satisfied, for our long toile and labours, and as happy men as any in the world.

<HEAD>A desperat Sea-fight betwixt two Spanish men of warre, and a small English ship, at the Ile of <HI>Dominica</HI> going to <HI>Virginia,</HI> by Captaine <HI>Anthony Chester.</HI></HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1620"/><NOTE PLACE="marg"> The Earle of Southampton Treasurer, and M. <HI>Iohn Ferrar</HI> Deputy.</NOTE>HAuing taken our iourney towards <HI>Virginia</HI> in the beginning of Februa∣ry, a ship called the <HI>Margaret</HI> and <HI>Iohn,</HI> of one hundred and sixty tuns, eight Iron Peeces and a Falcon, with eightie Passengers besides Sailers; After many tempests and foule weather, about the foureteenth of March we were in thirteene degrees and an halfe of Northerly latitude, where we descried a ship at hull; it being but a faire gale of wind, we edged towards her to see what she was, but she presently set saile, and ran vs quickly out of sight: This made vs keepe our course for <HI>Mettalina,</HI> and the next day passing <HI>Dominica,</HI> we came to an anchor at <HI>Guardalupo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A French-man cast away at <HI>Guardalupo.</HI></NOTE> to take in fresh water. Six French-men there cast away sixteene moneths agoe came aboord vs; they told vs a Spanish man of Warre but seuen daies before was seeking his consort, and this was she we descri∣ed at hull. At <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uis</HI> we intended to refresh our selues, hauing beene eleuen weeks pestered in this vnwholsome ship; but there we found two tall ships with the <HI>Hollanders</HI> colours, but necessitie forcing vs on shore, we anchored faire by them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spaniards</HI> begin.</NOTE> and in friendly manner sent to hale them: but seeing they were <HI>Spaniards,</HI> retiring to our ship, they sent such a volley of shot after vs, that shot the Boat, split the Oares, and some thorow the clothes, yet not a man hurt; and then fol∣lowed with their great Ordnance, that many times ouer-racked our ship, which be∣ing so cumbred with the Passengers prouisions, our Ordnance was not well fit∣ted, nor any thing as it should haue beene. But perceiuing what they were, we fitted our selues the best we could to preuent a mischiefe, seeing them warp them∣selues to windward, we thought it not good to be boorded on both sides at an anchor, we intended to set saile, but that the Vice-Admirall battered so hard our star-boord side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vice-Admi∣rall shot be∣tweene wind and water.</NOTE> that we fell to our businesse, and answered their vnkindnesse with such faire shot from a Demiculuering, that shot her betweene wind and water, whereby she was glad to leaue vs and her Admirall together. Comming faire by our quarter, he tooke in his <HI>Holland</HI> flag, and put forth his Spanish colours, and so haled vs.</P>
<P>We quietly and quickly answered him, both what wee were, and whither bound, relating the effect of our Commission, and the cause of our comming thither for water, and not to annoy any of the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> Subiects, nor any. She commanded vs amaine for the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> we replied with inlarging the particulars what friends both the Kings our Masters were, and as we would doe no wrong, we would take none. They commanded vs aboord to shew our Com∣mission, which we refused, but if they would send their Boat to vs willingly they should see it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of their fight.</NOTE> But for answer they made two great shot at vs, with a volley of small shot, which caused vs to leaue the decks; then with many ill words they laid vs aboord, which caused vs to raise our maine saile, and giue the word to our small shot which lay close and ready, that paid them in such sort, they quickly re∣tired. The fight continued halfe an houre, as if we had beene inuironed with fire and smoke, vntill they discouered the waste of our ship naked, where they braue∣ly boorded vs loofe for loofe, hasting with pikes and swords to enter, but it plea∣sed God so to direct our Captaine, and encourage our men with valour, that our pikes being formerly placed vnder our halfe deck, and certaine shot lying close for that purpose vnder the Port holes, encountred them so rudely, that their fury was not onely rebated, but their hastinesse intercepted, and their whole com∣pany beaten backe, many of our men were hurt, but I am sure they had two for one.</P>
<P>In the end they were violently repulsed, vntill they were reinforced to charge

This we saw with our eies, and reioyced with it at our hearts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Captaine slaine.</NOTE> so that we might perceiue good successe comming on, our Captaine presently tooke ad∣uantage of their discomfiture; though with much comiseration of that resolute Captaine, and not onely plied them againe with our Ordnance, but had more shot vnder the Pikes, which was bestowed to good purpose, and amazed our ene∣mies with the suddennesse.</P>
<P>Amongst the rest, one <HI>Lucas,</HI> our Carpenters Mate, must not be forgotten,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A worthy exploit of <HI>Lucas.</HI></NOTE> who perceiuing away how to annoy them; As they were thus puzl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and in a confusi∣on, drew out a Minion vnder the halfe decke, and there bent it vpon them in such a manner, that when it was fired, the cases of stones and peeces of Iron fell vpon them so thick, as cleared the decke, and slew many, and in short time we saw few assailants, but such as crept from place to place couertly from the fury of our shot, which now was thicker than theirs: for although has far as we may cōmend our enemies, they had done something worthy of commendations; yet either wanting men, or being ouertaken with the vnlooked for valour of our men, they now be∣gan to shrinke, and giue vs leaue to be wanton with our aduantage. Yet we could onely vse but foure peece of Ordnances, but they serued the turne as well as all the rest: for she was shot so oft betweene wind and water, we saw they were wil∣ling to leaue vs, but by reason she was fast in the latch of our cable, which in haste of weighing our anchor hung aloofe, she could not cleare her selfe as she wrought to doe, till one cut the Cable with an axe, and was slaine by freeing vs. Hauing beene a boord vs two houres and an halfe, seeing her selfe cleere, all the shot wee had plaied on both sides, which lasted till we were out of shot, then we discouered the Vice-Admirall comming to her assistance, who began a farre off to ply vs with their Ordnances, and put vs in minde we had another worke in hand. Whereup∣on we separated the dead and hurt bodies, and manned the ship with the rest, and were so well incouraged wee waifed them amaine. The <HI>Admirall</HI> stood aloofe off, and the other would not come within Falcon shot, where she lay battering vs till shee receiued another paiment from a Demiculuering, which made her beare with the shore for smooth water to mend her leakes. The next morning they both came vp againe with vs, as if they had determined to deuour vs at once, but it see∣med it was but a brauado, though they forsooke not our quarter for a time within Musket shot; yet all the night onely they kept vs company, but made not a shot. During which time we had leasure to prouide vs better than before: but God be∣thanked they made onely but a shew of another a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sault, ere suddenly the Vice-ad∣mirall fell a starne, and the other lay shaking in the wind, and so they both left vs. The fight continued six houres, and was the more vnwelcome, because we were so ill prouided, and had no intent to sight, nor giue occasion to disturbe them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The euent of the fight.</NOTE> As for the losse of men, if Religion had not taught vs what by the prouidence of God is brought to passe, yet daily experience might informe vs, of the dangers of wars, and perils at sea, by stormes tempests, shipwracks, encounters with Pirats, meeting with enemies, crosse winds, long vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ages, vnknowne shores, barbarous Nations, and an hundred inconueniences, of which humane pollicies are not capa∣ble, nor mens coniectures apprehensiue. We lost Doctor <HI>Bohun,</HI> a worthy valian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gentleman, (a long time brought vp amongst the most learned Surgeons, and Physitions in <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and this his second iourney to <HI>Ʋirginia</HI>:) and seuen slaine out right, two died shortly of their wounds; sixte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was shot, whose limbs

God be thanked was recouered without maime, and now setled in <HI>Virginia:</HI> how many they lost we know not, but we saw a great many lie on the decks, and their skuppers runne with bloud, they were abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> three hundred tunnes a peece, each sixteene or twentie Brasse peeces. Captaine <HI>Chester,</HI> who in this fight had beha∣ued himselfe like a most vigilant, resolute, and a couragious souldier, as also our honest and valiant master, did still so comfort and incourage vs by all the meanes they could, at last to all our great contents we arriued in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and from thence returned safely to <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>In them nine Ships that went with Sir <HI>Francis VVyat</HI> not one Passenger died, at his arriuall he sent Master <HI>Thorpe</HI> to <HI>Opechancanough,</HI> whom hee found much satisfied with his comming, to confirme their leagues as he had done his Prede∣cessors, and so contented his people should coinhabit amongst them, and hee found more motions of Religion in him than could be imagined: euery man be∣taking himselfe to his quarter, it was ordered, that for euery head they should plant but 1000. Plants of Tobacco, and vpon each plant nine leaues, which will be about 100. weight, the Corne being appointed but at two shillings &amp; six pence the bushell, required such labour, it caused most men neglect it, and depend vpon trade; where were it rated at ten shillings the bushell, euery man would indeuour to haue plenty to sell to the new commers, or any that wanted, and seldome any is transported from <HI>England,</HI> but it standeth in as much, besides the hazard and other necessaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Master <HI>Gookins</HI> Plantation.</NOTE> the Ships might transport of that burden.

<HEAD>The massacre vpon the two and twentieth of March.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of <HI>Nemattanow,</HI> writ by M. <HI>Wimp.</HI></NOTE>THe Prologue to this Tragedy, is supposed was occasioned by <HI>Nematta∣now,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Iack</HI> of the <HI>Feather,</HI> because hee commonly was most strangely adorned with them; and for his courage and policy, was accounted amongst the Saluages their chiefe Captaine, and immortall from any hurt could bee done him by the <HI>English.</HI> This Captaine comming to one <HI>Morgans</HI> house, knowing he had many commodities that hee desired, per∣swaded <HI>Morgan</HI> to goe with him to <HI>Pamauke</HI> to trucke, but the Saluage murde∣red him by the way; and after two or three daies returned againe to <HI>Morgans</HI> house, where he found two youths his Seruants, who asked for their Master: <HI>Iack</HI> replied directly he was dead; the Boyes suspecting as it was, by seeing him weare his Cap, would haue had him to Master <HI>Thorp:</HI> But <HI>Iack</HI> so moued their patience, they shot him, so he fell to the ground, put him in a Boat to haue him before the Gouernor, then seuen or eight miles from them. But by the way <HI>Iack</HI> finding the pangs of death vpon him, desired of the Boyes two things; the one was, that they would not make it knowne hee was slaine with a bullet; the other, to bury him amongst the <HI>English.</HI> At the losse of this Saluage <HI>Opechankanough</HI> much grie∣ued and repined, with great threats of reuenge; but the <HI>English</HI> returned him such terrible answers, that he cunningly dissembled his intent, with the greatest signes he could of loue and peace, yet within foureteene daies after he acted what followeth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Security a bad guard▪</NOTE>Sir <HI>Francis Wyat</HI> at his arriuall was aduertised, he found the Countrey setled in such a firme peace, as most men there thought sure and vnuiolable, not onely in regard of their promises, but of a necessitie. The poore weake Saluages being euery way bettered by vs, and safely sheltred and defended, whereby wee might freely follow our businesse: and such was the conceit of this conceited peace, as that there was seldome or neuer a sword, and seldomer a peece, except for a Deere or Fowle, by which assurances the most plantations were placed straglingly and scatteringly, as a choice veine of rich ground inuited them, and further from neighbours the better. Their houses generally open to the Saluages, who were alwaies friendly fed at their tables, and lodged in their bed-chambers, which made the way plaine to effect their intents, and the conuersion of the Saluages as they supposed.</P>
<P>Hauing occasion to send to <HI>Opechankanough</HI> about the middle of March, hee vsed the Messenger well, and told him he held the peace so firme, the sky should fall or he dissolued it; yet such was the treachery of those people, when they had contriued our destruction, euen but two daies before the massacre, they guided our men with much kindnesse thorow the woods, and one <HI>Browne</HI> that liued a∣mong them to learne the language, they sent home to his Master; yea, they bor∣rowed our Boats to transport themselues ouer the Riuer, to consult on the deuillish murder that insued, and of our vtter extirpation, which God of his mercy (by the meanes of one of themselues conuerted to Christianitie) preuented, and as well on the Friday morning that fatall day, being the two and twentieth of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the massacre.</NOTE> as also in the euening before, as at other times they came vnarmed into our houses, with Deere, Turkies, Fish, Fruits, and other prouisions to sell vs, yea in some places sat downe at breakfast with our people, whom immediatly with their owne tooles they slew most barbarously, not sparing either age or sex, man woman or childe, so sudden in their execution, that few or none discerned the weapon or blow that brought them to destruction: In which manner also they slew many of our people at seuerall works in the fields, well knowing in what places and quarters each of our men were, in regard of their familiaritie with vs, for the effecting that great master-peece of worke their conuersion; and by this meanes fell that fatall morning vnder the bloudy and barbarous hands of that per∣fidious
<PB N="145" REF="83"/>
and inhumane people, three hundred forty seuen men, women and chil∣dren, most by their owne weapons, and not being content with their liues, they fell againe vpon the dead bodies, making as well as they could a fresh murder, defacing, dragging, and mangling their dead carkases into many peeces, and ca∣rying some parts away in derision, with base and brutish triumph.</P>
<P>Neither yet did these beasts spare those amongst the rest well knowne vnto them, from whom they had daily receiued many benefits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their cruelty.</NOTE> but spightfully also massacred them without any remorse or pitie; being in this more fell then Lions and Dragons, as Histories record, which haue preserued their Benefactors; such is the force of good deeds, though done to cruell beasts, to take humanitie vpon them, but these miscreants put on a more vnnaturall brutishnesse then beasts, as by those instances may appeare.</P>
<P>That worthy religions Gentleman M. <HI>George Thorp,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The murder of Master <HI>Thorp.</HI></NOTE> Deputie to the College lands, sometimes one of his Maiesties Pensioners, &amp; in command one of the prin∣cipall in <HI>Virginia</HI>; did so truly affect their conuersion, that whosoeuer vnder him did them the least displeasure, were punished seuerely. He thought nothing too deare for them, he neuer denied them any thing, in so much that when they com∣plained that our Mastiues did feare them, he to content them in all things, caused some of them to be killed in their presence, to the great displeasure of the owners, and would haue had all the rest guelt to make them the milder, might he haue had his will. The King dwelling but in a Cottage, he built him a faire house af∣ter the English fashion, in which he tooke such pleasure, especially in the locke and key, which he so admired, as locking and vnlocking his doore a hundred times a day, he thought no deuice in the world comparable to it.</P>
<P>Thus insinuating himselfe into this Kings fauour for his religious purpose, he conferred oft with him about Religion, as many other in this former Discourse had done, and this Pagan confessed to him as he did to them, our God was bet∣ter then theirs, and seemed to be much pleased with that Discourse, and of his company, and to requite all those courtesies; yet this viperous brood did, as the sequell shewed, not onely murder him, but with such spight and scorne abused his dead corps as is vnfitting to be heard with ciuill eares. One thing I cannot omit, that when this good Gentleman vpon his fatall houre, was warned by his man, who perceiuing some treachery intended by those hell-hounds, to looke to himselfe, and withall ran away for feare he should be apprehended, and so saued his owne life; yet his Master out of his good meaning was so void of suspition and full of confidence▪ they had slaine him, or he could or would beleeue they would hurt him. Captaine <HI>Nathaniel Powell</HI> one of the first Planters, a vali∣ant Souldier, and not any in the Countrey better knowne amongst them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The slau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hter of Captaine <HI>Powell.</HI></NOTE> yet such was the error of an ouer-conceited power and prosperitie, and their simpli∣cities, they not onely slew him and his family, but butcher-like hagled their bo∣dies, and cut off his head, to expresse their vttermost height of cruelty.

Here the Saluages with many presents and faire perswasions, fained they came for Capt. <HI>Ralfe Hamer</HI> to go to their King, then hunting in the woods, presently they sent to him, but he not comming as they expected, set fire of a To∣bacco-house, and then came to tell them in the dwelling house of it to quench it; all the men ran towards it, but Master <HI>Hamer</HI> not suspecting any thing, whom
<PB N="146" REF="84"/>
the Saluages pursued, shot them full of arrowes, then beat out their braines. <HI>Ha∣mer</HI> hauing finished a letter hee was a writing, followed after to see what was the matter, but quickly they shot an arrow in his back, which caused him returne and barricado vp the doores, whereupon the Saluages set fire on the house. <HI>Ha∣risons</HI> Boy finding his Masters peece loaded, discharged it at randome, at which bare report the Saluages all fled, <HI>Baldwin</HI> still discharging his peece, and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ha∣mer</HI> with two and twentie persons thereby got to his house, leauing their owne burning. In like manner, they had fired Lieutenant <HI>Basse</HI> his house, with all the rest there about, slaine the people, and so left that Plantation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Ralfe Hamer</HI> with for∣ty escapeth.</NOTE>Captaine <HI>Hamer</HI> all this while not knowing any thing, comming to his Bro∣ther that had sent for him to go hunt with the King, meeting the Saluages chasing some, yet escaped, retired to his new house then a building, from whence he came; there onely with spades, axes, and brick bats, he defended himselfe and his Com∣pany till the Saluages departed. Not long after, the Master from the ship had sent six Musketiers, with which he recouered their Merchants store-house, where he armed ten more, and so with thirtie more vnarmed workmen, found his Brother and the rest at <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldwins</HI>: Now seeing all they had was burnt and consumed, they repaired to <HI>Iames</HI> Towne with their best expedition; yet not far from <HI>Mar∣tins</HI> hundred, where seuenty three were slaine, was a little house and a small family, that heard not of any of this till two daies after.</P>
<P>All those, and many others whom they haue as maliciously murdered, sought the good of those poore brutes, that thus despising Gods mercies, must needs now as miscreants be corrected by Iustice: to which leauing them, I will knit to∣gether the thred of this discourse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Saluages attempt to sur∣prise a ship.</NOTE> At the time of the massacre, there were three or foure ships in <HI>Iames</HI> Riuer, and one in the next, and daily more to come in, as there did within foureteene daies after, one of which they indeuoured to haue surprised: yet were the hearts of the English euer stupid, and auerted from be∣leeuing any thing might weaken their hopes, to win them by kinde vsage to Christianitie. But diuers write from thence, that Almighty God hath his great worke in this Tragedy, and will thereout draw honor and glory to his name, and a more flourishing estate and safetie to themselues, and with more speed to con∣uert the Saluage children to himselfe, since he so miraculously hath preserued the English; there being yet, God be praised, eleuen parts of twelue remaining, whose carelesse neglect of their owne safeties, seemes to haue beene the greatest cause of their destructions: yet you see, God by a conuerted Saluage that disclosed the plot, saued the rest, and the Pinnace then in <HI>Pamavukes</HI> Riuer, whereof (say they) though our sinnes made vs vnworthy of so glorious a conuersion, yet his infinite wisdome can neuerthelesse bring it to passe, and in good time, by such meanes as we thinke most vnlikely: for in the deliuery of them that suruiue, no mans particular carefulnesse saued one person, but the meere goodnesse of God himselfe, freely and miraculously preseruing whom he pleased.</P>
<P>The Letters of Master <HI>George Sands,</HI> a worthy Gentleman, and many others besides them returned, brought vs this vnwelcome newes, that hath beene heard at large in publike Court, that the <HI>Indians</HI> and they liued as one Nation, yet by a generall combination in one day plotted to subuert the whole Colony, and at one instant, though our seuerall Plantations were one hundred and fortie miles vp on Riuer on both sides.</P>
<P>But for the better vnderstanding of all things, you must remember these wilde naked natiues liue not in great numbers together, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t dispersed, common∣ly in thirtie, fortie, fiftie, or sixtie in a company. Some places haue two hundred, few places more, but many lesse; yet they had all warning giuen them one from another in all their habitations, though farre asunder, to meet at the day and houre appointed for our destruction at al our seueral Plantations; some directed to one place, some to another, all to be done at the time appointed, which they did accordingly: Some entring their houses vnder colour of trading, so tooke their

aduantage; others drawing vs abroad vnder faire pretences, and the rest suddenly falling vpon those that were at their labours.</P>
<P>Six of the counsell suffered vnder this treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Six of the Coun∣cell slaine.</NOTE> and the slaughter had beene vniuersall, if God had not put it into the heart of an <HI>Indian,</HI> who lying in the house of one <HI>Pace,</HI> was vrged by another <HI>Indian</HI> his Brother, that lay with him the night before to kill <HI>Pace,</HI> as he should doe <HI>Perry</HI> which was his friend, being so commanded from their King; telling him also how the next day the executi∣on should be finished: <HI>Perrys Indian</HI> presently arose and reueales it to <HI>Pace,</HI> that vsed him as his sonne; and thus them that escaped was saued by this one con∣uerted Infidell. And though three hundred fortie seuen were slaine, yet thousands of ours were by the meanes of this alone thus preserued, for which Gods name be praised for euer and euer.</P>

Since wee finde <HI>Opechankanough</HI> the last yeare had practised with a King on the Easterne shore, to furnish him with a kind of poi∣son, which onely growes in his Country to poison vs. But of this bloudy acte neuer griefe and shame poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed any people more then themselues, to be thus but∣chered by so naked and cowardly a people, who dare not stand the presenting of a staffe in manner of a peece, nor an vncharged peec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the hands of a woman.

<P>Thus haue you heard the particulars of this massacre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memorandums.</NOTE> which in those respects some say will be good for the Plantation, because now we haue iust cause to de∣stroy them by all meanes possible: but I thinke it had beene much better it had neuer happened, for they haue giuen vs an hundred times as iust occasions long agoe to subiect them, (and I wonder I can heare of none but Master <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ockam</HI> and Master <HI>Whitaker</HI> of my opinion.) Moreouer, where before we were troubled in cleering the ground of great Timber, which was to them of small vse: now we may take their owne plaine fields and Habitations, which are the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easantest places in the Countrey. Besides, the Deere, Turkies, and other Beasts and Fowles will exceedingly increase if we beat the Saluages out of the Countrey, for at all times of the yeare they neuer spare Male nor Female, old nor young, egges nor birds, fat nor leane, in season or out of season with them, all is one. The like they did in our Swine and Goats, for they haue vsed to kill eight in tenne more then we, or else the wood would most plentifully abound with victuall; besides it is more easie to ciuilize them by conquest then faire meanes: for the one may be made at once, but their ciuilizing will require a long time and much industry. The manner how to suppresse them is so often related and approued, I omit it here: And you haue twenty examples of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> how they got the
<HI>West-Indies,</HI> and forced the treacherous and rebellious Infidels to doe all manner of drudgery worke and slauery for them, themselues liuing like Souldiers vpon the fruits of their labours. This will make vs more circumspect, and be an example to posteritie: (But I say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Smith.</HI></NOTE> this might as well haue beene put in practise sixteene yeares agoe as now.)</P>
<P>Thus vpon this Anuill shall wee now beat our selues an Armour of proofe hereafter to defend vs against such incu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Maiesties g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</NOTE> and euer hereafter make vs more circumspect: but to helpe to repaire this losse, besides his Maiesties bounty in Armes, he gaue the Company out of the Tower, and diuers other Honorable per∣sons haue renewed their aduentures, we must not omit the Honorable Citie of <HI>London,</HI> to whose endlesse praise wee may speake it, are now setting forward one hundred persons, and diuers others at their owne costs are a repairing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>London</HI> sets out 100 persons.</NOTE> and all

<P>What growing state was there euer in the world which had not the like? <HI>Rome</HI> grew by oppression, and rose vpon the backe of her enemies: and the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> haue had many of those counterbuffes, more than we. <HI>Columbus,</HI> vpon his returne from the <HI>West-Indies</HI> into <HI>Spaine,</HI> hauing left his people with the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> in peace and promise of good vsage amongst them, at his returne backe found not one of them liuing, but all treacherously slaine by the Saluages. After this againe, when the Spanish Colonies were increased to great numbers, the <HI>In∣dians</HI> from whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for trucking stuffe vsed to haue all their corne, generally conspired together to plant no more at all, intending thereby to famish them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lamentable ex∣ample, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o oft app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oued.</NOTE> themselues liuing in the meane time vpon Cassaua, a root to make bread, onely then knowne to themselues. This plot of theirs by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ouer∣sight, that foolishly depended vpon strangers for their bread, tooke such effect, and brought them to such misery by the rage of famine, that they spared no vn∣cleane nor loathsome beast, no not the poisonous and hideous Serpents, but eat them vp also, deuouring one death to saue them from another; and by this meanes their whole Colony well-neere surfeted, sickned and died miserably, and when they had againe recouered this losse, by their incontinency an infinite num∣ber of them died on the <HI>Indian</HI> disease, we call the French Pox, which at first be∣ing a strange and an vnknowne malady, was deadly vpon whomsoeuer it ligh∣ted: then had they a little flea called <HI>Nigua,</HI> which got betweene the skinne and the flesh before they were aware, and there bred and multiplied, making swel∣lings and putrifactions, to the decay and losse of many of their bodily members.</P>
<P>Againe, diuers times they were neere vndone by their ambition, faction, and malice of the Commanders. <HI>Columbus,</HI> to whom they were also much behol∣den, was sent with his Brother in chaines into <HI>Spaine</HI>; and some other great Com∣manders killed and murdered one another. <HI>Pizzaro</HI> was killed by <HI>Almagros</HI> sonne, and him <HI>Ʋasco</HI> beheaded, which <HI>Ʋasco</HI> was taken by <HI>Blasco,</HI> and <HI>Blasco</HI> was likewise taken by <HI>Pizzaros</HI> Brother: And thus by their couetous and spight∣full quarrels, they were euer shaking the maine pillars of their Common-weale. These and many more mischiefes and calamities hapned them, more then euer did to vs, and at one time being euen at the last gaspe, had two ships not arriued with supplies as they did, they were so disheartned, they were a leauing the Coun∣trey: yet we see for all those miseries they haue attained to their ends at last, as is manifest to all the world, both with honour, powe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and wealth: and whereas be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore few could be hired to goe to inhabit there, now with great sute they must obtaine it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note this con∣clusion.</NOTE> but where there was no honesty, nor equity, nor sanctitie, nor veritie, nor pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie, nor good ciuilitie in such a Countrey, certainly there can bee no sta∣bilitie.</P>
<P>Therefore let vs not be discouraged, but rather animated by those conclusions, seeing we are so well assured of the goodnesse and commodities may bee had in <HI>Virginia,</HI> nor is it to be much doubted there is any want of Mines of most sorts, no not of the richest, as is well knowne to some yet liuing that can make it manifest when time shall serue: and yet to thinke that gold and siluer Mines are in a coun∣try otherwise most rich and fruitfull, or the greatest wealth in a Plantation, is but a popular error, as is that opinion likewise, that the gold and siluer is now the grea∣test wealth of the West Indies at this present.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Spani∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds</HI> raise their wealth in the West Indies.</NOTE> True it is indeed, that in the first con∣quest the Spaniards got great and mighty store of treasure from the Natiues, which they in long space had heaped together, and in those times the Indians shewed them entire and rich Mines, which now by the relations of them that haue beene there, are exceedingly wasted, so that now the charge of getting those Me∣tals is growne excessiue, besides the consuming the liues of many by their pesti∣lent smoke and vapours in digging and refining them, so that all things conside∣red, the cleere gaines of those metals, the Kings part defraied, to the Aduenturers is but small, and nothing neere so much as vulgarly is imagined; and were it not
<PB N="149" REF="85"/>
for other rich Commodities there that inrich them, those of the Contraction house were neuer able to subsist by the Mines onely; for the greatest part of their Commodities are partly naturall, and partly transported from other parts of the world, and planted in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> as in their mighty wealth of Sugarcanes, be∣ing first transported from the Canaries; and in Ginger and other things brought out of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> in their Cochanele, Indicos, Cotton, and their infinite store of Hides, Quick-siluer, Allum, Woad, Brasill woods, Dies, Paints, Tobacco, Gums, Balmes, Oiles, Medicinals and Perfumes, Sassaparilla, and many other physicall drugs: These are the meanes whereby they raise that mighty charge of drawing out their gold and siluer to the great &amp; cleare reuenue of their King. Now seeing the most of those commodities, or as vsefull, may be had in <HI>Virginia</HI> by the same meanes, as I haue formerly said; let vs with all speed take the priority of time, where also may be had the priority of place, in chusing the best seats of the Country, which now by vanquishing the saluages, is like to offer a more faire and ample choice of fruitfull habitations, then hitherto our gentlenesse and faire comportments could attaine vnto.</P>

But now to leape out of this labyrinth of melancholy, all this did not so discourage the noble aduenturers, nor diuers others still to vndertake new seuerall Plantations, but that diuers ships were dispatched away, for their supplies and assistance thought sufficient.

<HEAD>The proiect and offer of Captaine <HI>Iohn Smith,</HI> to the Right Honourable, and Right Worshipfull Company Virginia.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Smiths</HI> offer to the Company.</NOTE>IF you please I may be transported with a hundred Souldiers and thirty Sai∣lers by the next <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> with victuall, munition, and such necessary prouision, by Gods assistance, we would endeuour to inforce the Saluages to leaue their Country, or bring them in that feare and subiection that euery man should follow their businesse securely, whereas now halfe their times and la∣bours are spent in watching and warding, onely to defend but altogether vnable to suppresse the Saluages, because euery man now being for himselfe will be vn∣willing to be drawne from their particular labours, to be made as pack-horses for all the rest, without any certainty of some better reward and preferment then I can vnderstand any there can or will yet giue them.</P>
<P>These I would imploy onely in ranging the Countries, and tormenting the Saluages, and that they should be as a running Army till this were effected, and then settle themselues in some such conuenient place, that should euer remaine a garison of that strength, ready vpon any occasion against the Saluages, or any other for the defence of the Countrey, and to see all the English well armed, and instruct them their vse. But I would haue a Barke of one hundred tunnes, and meanes to build sixe or seuen Shalops, to transport them where there should bee occasion.</P>
<P>Towards the charge, because it is for the generall good, and what by the mas∣sacre and other accidents, <HI>Virginia</HI> is disparaged, and many men and their purses much discouraged, how euer a great many doe hasten to goe, thinking to bee next heires to all the former losses, I feare they will not finde all things as they doe imagine; therefore leauing those gilded conceits, and diue into the true estate of the Colony; I thinke if his Maiestie were truly informed of their ne∣cessitie, and the benefit of this proiect, he would be pleased to giue the custome of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the Planters also according to their abilities would adde there∣to such a contribution, as would be fit to maintaine this garison till they be able to subsist, or cause some such other collections to be made, as may put it with all expedition in practice; otherwise it is much to be doubted, there will neither come custome, nor any thing from thence to <HI>England</HI> within these few yeares.</P>
<P>Now if this should be thought an imploiment more fit for ancient Souldiers there bred, then such new commers as may goe with me; you may please to leaue that to my discretion, to accept or refuse such voluntaries, that will hazard their fortunes in the trialls of these euents, and discharge such of my company that had rather labour the ground then subdue their enemies: what releefe I should haue from your Colony I would satisfie and spare them (when I could) the like courtesie. Notwithstanding these doubts, I hope to feede them as well as defend them, and yet discouer you more land vnknowne then they all yet know, if you will grant me such priuiledges as of necessity must be vsed.</P>
<P>For against any enemy we must be ready to execute the best can be deuised by your state there, but not that they shall either take away my men, or any thing else to imploy as they please by vertue of their authority, and in that I haue done somewhat for <HI>New-England</HI> as well as <HI>Virginia,</HI> so I would desire liberty and au∣thority to make the best vse I can of my best experiences, within the limits of those two Patents, and to bring them both in one Map, and the Countries be∣twixt them, giuing alwaies that respect to the Gouernors and gouernment, as an Englishman doth in <HI>Scotland▪</HI> or a Scotchman in <HI>England,</HI> or as the regiments in the Low-countries doe to the Gouernors of the Townes and Cities where they are billited, or in Garrison, where though they liue with them, and are as their

seruants to defend them, yet not to be disposed on at their pleasure, but as the Prince and State doth command them, and for my owne paines in particular I aske not any thing but what I can produce from the proper labour of the Saluages.</P>

<HEAD>Their Answer.</HEAD>
<P>I Cannot say, it was generally for the Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their answer,</NOTE> for being published in their Court, the most that heard it liked exceeding well of the motion, and some would haue been very large Aduenturers in it, especially Sir <HI>Iohn Brookes</HI> and Master <HI>Dauid Wyffin,</HI> but there were such diuisions amongst them, I could obtaine no answer but this, the charge would be too great; their stocke was de∣cayed, and they did thinke the Planters should doe that of themselues if I could finde meanes to effect it; they did thinke I might haue leaue of the Company, prouided they might haue halfe the pillage, but I thinke there are not many will much striue for that imploiment, for except it be a little Corne at some time of the yeere is to be had, I would not giue twenty pound for all the pillage is to be got amongst the Saluages in twenty yeeres: but because they supposed I spake on∣ly for my owne ends, it were good those vnderstand prouidents for the Compa∣nies good they so much talke of, were sent thither to make triall of their pro∣found wisdomes and long experiences.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the Sallery.</NOTE>About this time also was propounded a proposition concerning a Sallery of fiue and twenty thousand pounds to be raised out of Tobacco, as a yeerely pensi∣on to bee paid to certaine Officers for the erecting a new office, concerning the sole importation of Tobacco, besides his Maiesties custome, fraught, and all other charges. To nominate the vndertakers, fauourers and opposers, with their arguments (<HI>pro</HI>) and (<HI>con</HI>) would bee too tedious and needlesse being so publikely knowne; the which to establish, spent a good part of that yeere, and the beginning of the next. This made
many thinke wonders of <HI>Virginia,</HI> to pay such pensions extraordinary to a few here that were neuer there, and also in what state and pompe some Chieftaines and diuers of their associ∣ates liue in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and yet no money to maintaine a Garrison, pay poore men their wages, nor yet fiue and twenty pence to all the Aduenturers here, and very little to the most part of the Planters there, bred such differences in opinion it was dissolued.</P>
<P>Now let vs returne to Captaine <HI>Croshaw</HI> at <HI>Patawomek,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Cro∣shaw</HI> states at <HI>Pa∣tawomek,</HI> and his aduentures.</NOTE> where he had not beene long ere <HI>Opechancanough</HI> sent two baskets of beads to this King, to kill him and his man, assuring him of the Massacre he had made, and that before the end of two Moones there should not be an Englishman in all their Countries: this feare∣full message the King told this Captaine, who replied, he had seene both the co∣wardise and trechery of <HI>Opechancanough</HI> sufficiently tried by Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> therefore his threats he feared not, nor for his fauour cared, but would nakedly fight with him or any of his with their owne swords; if he were slaine, he would leaue a letter for his Country men to know, the fault was his owne, not the Kings; two daies the King deliberated vpon an answer, at last told him the English were his friends, and the Saluage Emperour <HI>Opitchapam</HI> now called <HI>Toya∣tan,</HI> was his brother, therefore there should be no bloud shed betwixt them, so hee returned the Presents, willing the <HI>Pamavukes</HI> to come no more in his Country, lest the English, though against his will, should doe them any mischiefe.</P>
<P>Not long after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The escape of <HI>Waters</HI> and his W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e.</NOTE> a Boat going abroad to seeke out some releefe amongst the Plantations, by <HI>Nuports-newes</HI> met such ill weather, though the men were saued they lost their boat, which the storme and waues cast vpon the shore of <HI>Nandsa∣mund,</HI> where <HI>Edmund Waters</HI> one of the three that first stayed in Summer Iles, and found the great peece of Amber-greece, dwelling in <HI>Virginia</HI> at this Massacre,

hee and his wife these <HI>Nandsamunds</HI> kept Prisoners till it chanced they found this Boat, at which purchase they so reioyced, according to their custome of tri∣umph, with songs, dances and inuocations, they were so busied, that <HI>Waters</HI> and his wife found opportunity to get secretly into their Canow, and so crossed the Riuer to <HI>Kecoughtan,</HI> which is nine or ten miles, whereat the English no lesse wondred and reioyced, then the Saluages were madded with discontent.

no small increasers of his malady, nor the thus abandoning our Plantations, the losse of our Haruest, and also Tobacco which was as our money; the Vineyard our Vineyetours had brought to a good forwardnesse, bruised and destroyed with Deere, and all things ere they came to perfection, with weeds, disorderly persons or wild beasts; so that as we are I cannot perceiue but the next yeere will be worse, being still tormented with pride and flattery, idlenesse and couetous∣nesse, as though they had vowed heere to keepe their Court with all the pesti∣lent vices in the world for their atte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dants, inchanted with a conceited stateli∣nesse, euen in the very bottome of miserable senselesnesse.</P>

<P>About the latter end of Iune, Sir <HI>George Yearley</HI> accompanied with the Coun∣cell, and a number of the greatest Gallants in the Land, stayed three or foure daies with Captaine <HI>Nuse,</HI> he making his moane to a chiefe man amongst them for want of prouision for his Company, the great Commander replied hee should turne them to his greene Corne, which would make them plumpe and fat: these fields being so neere the Fort, were better regarded and preserued then the rest, but the great mans command, as we call them, was quickly obeied, for though it was scarce halfe growne either to the greatnesse or goodnesse, they deuoured it greene though it did them small good. Sir <HI>George</HI> with his company went to <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>comack</HI> to his new P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antation, where he staied neere six weekes; some Corne he brought home, but as he aduentured for himselfe, he accordingly enioyed the benefit; some pety Magazines came this Summer, but either the restraint by Pro∣clamation, or want of Boats, or both, caused few but the Chieftaines to be little better by them. So long as Captaine <HI>Nuse</HI> had any thing we had part;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Nuse</HI> his misery.</NOTE> but now all being spent, and the people forced to liue vpon Oisters and Crabs, they be∣came so faint no worke could be done; and where the Law was, no worke, no meat, now the case is altered, to no meat, no worke; some small quantity of Milke and Rice the Captaine had of his owne, and that he would distribute <HI>gratis</HI> as he saw occasion; I say <HI>gratis,</HI> for I know no place else, but it was sold for ready pai∣ment: those eares of Corne that had escaped till August, though not ripe by rea∣son of the late planting, the very Dogs did repaire to the Corne fields to seeke them as the men till they were hanged; and this I protest before God is true that I haue related, not to flatter <HI>Nuse,</HI> nor condemne any, but all the time I haue li∣ued in <HI>Ʋirginia,</HI> I haue not seene nor heard that any Commander hath taken such continuall paines for the publike, or done so little good for himselfe, and his ver∣tuous wife was no lesse charitable and compassionate according to her power.

men nor victuall prouided, as the honourable Aduenturers did promise mee in <HI>England</HI>; yet at my owne charge, hauing made these preparations, and the silke-Wormes ready to be couered, all was lost, but my poore life and children, by the Massacre, the which as God in his mercy did preserue, I continually pray we may spend to his glory.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Alarum, foure slaine.</NOTE> The 9. of September, we had an alarum, and two men at their labours slaine; the Captaine, though extreme sicke, sallied forth, but the Sal∣uages lay hid in the Corne fields all night, where they destroyed all they could, and killed two men more, much mischiefe they did to Master <HI>Edward Hills</HI> cattle, yet he alone defended his house though his men were sicke and could doe no∣thing, and this was our first assault since the Massacre.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The kindnesse of the King of <HI>Pata∣womek.</HI></NOTE>About this time Captaine <HI>Madyson</HI> passed by vs, hauing taken Prisoners, the King of <HI>Patawomek,</HI> his sonne, and two more, and thus it happened; <HI>Madyson</HI> not liking so well to liue amongst the Saluages as <HI>Croshaw</HI> did, built him a strong house within the Fort, so that they were not so sociable as before, nor did they much like <HI>Poole</HI> the Interpret; many Alarums they had, but saw no enemies: <HI>Madyson</HI> before his building went to <HI>Moyaones,</HI> where hee got prouision for a moneth, and was promised much more, so he returned to <HI>Patawomek</HI> and built this house, and was well vsed by the Saluages. Now by the foure great men the King sent to <HI>Pamavuke</HI> for the redemption of the Prisoners, <HI>Madyson</HI> sent them a letter, but they could neither deliuer it nor see them: so long they stayed that the King grew doubtfull of their bad vsage, that hee swore by the Skyes, if they returned not well, he would haue warres with <HI>Opechankanough</HI> so long as he had any thing: at this time two of <HI>Madysons</HI> men ranne from him, to finde them he sent Master <HI>Iohn Vpton</HI> and three more with an Indian guide to <HI>Nazatica,</HI> where they heard they were.

King told him he might if he would, but desired not to leaue him destitute of aid, hauing so many enemies about him; the Captaine told him he would leaue a guard, but intreated his answer concerning the twelue great men for the Gouer∣nour; the King replied, his enemies lay so about him he could not spare them, then the Captaine desired his sonne and one other; my sonne, said the King, is gone abroad about businesse, but the other you desire you shall haue, and that other sits by him, but that man refused to goe, whereupon <HI>Madyson</HI> went forth and locked the doore, leauing the King, his sonne, and foure Saluages, and fiue English men in the strong house, and setting vpon the towne with the rest of his men, slew thirty or forty men, women and children; the King demanding the cause, <HI>Poole</HI> told him the treason, crying out to intreat the Captaine cease from such cruelty: but hauing slaine and made flye all in the towne, hee returned, taxing the poore King of treason, who denied to the death not to know of any such matter, but said, This is some plot of them that told it, onely to kill mee for being your friend. Then <HI>Madyson</HI> willed him, to command none of his men should shoot at him as he went aboord, which he presently did, and it was performed: so <HI>Madyson</HI> departed, leading the King, his sonne, and two more to his ship, promising when all his men were shipped, he should returne at libertie; notwithstanding he brought them to <HI>Iames</HI> towne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King set at liberty.</NOTE> where they lay some daies, and af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er were sent home by Captaine <HI>Hamer,</HI> that tooke Corne for their ransome, and after set faile for New found Land.</P>

Their Corne fields being newly gathered, they surprized all they found, burnt the houses remained vnburnt, and so departed. Quartering about <HI>Kecoughtan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Samuell Collyer</HI> slaine.</NOTE> after the Watch was set, <HI>Samuell Collyer</HI> one of the most ancientest Planters, and very well acquainted with their language and habitation, humors and conditi∣ons, and Gouernor of a Towne, when the Watch was set going the round, vnfor∣tunately by a Centinell that discharged his peece, was slaine.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="90"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">They surprise <HI>Pamavuke.</HI></NOTE>Thence they sailed to <HI>Pamavuke,</HI> the chiefe seat of <HI>Opechankanough,</HI> the con∣triuer of the massacre: the Saluages seemed exceeding fearefull, promising to bring them <HI>Sara,</HI> and the rest of the English yet liuing, with all the Armes, and what they had to restore, much desiring peace, and to giue them any satisfaction they could. Many such deuices they fained to procrastinate the time ten or twelue daies, till they had got away their Corne from all the other places vp the Riuer, but that where the English kept their quarter: at last, when they saw all those promises were but delusions, they seised on all the Corne there was, set fire on their houses: and in following the Saluages that fled before thē, some few of those naked Deuils had that spirit, they lay in ambuscado, and as our men marched discharged some shot out of English peeces, and hurt some of them flying at their pleasures where they listed, burning their empty houses before them as they went to make themselues sport: so they escaped, and Sir <HI>George</HI> returned with Corne, where for our paines we had three bushels apeece, but we were enioyned before we had it, to pay ten shillings the bushell for fraught and other charges. Thus by this meanes the Saluages are like as they report, to endure no small mi∣sery this Winter, and that some of our men are returned to their former Plan∣tations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The opinion of Captaine <HI>Smith.</HI></NOTE>What other passages or impediments hapned in their proceedings, that they were not fully reuenged of the Saluages before they returned, I know not; nor could euer heare more, but that they supposed they slew two, and how it was im∣possible for any men to doe more then they did: yet worthy <HI>Ferdinando Courtus</HI> had scarce three hundred <HI>Spaniards</HI> to conquer the great Citie of <HI>Mexico,</HI> where thousands of Saluages dwelled in strong houses: but because they were a ciuilized people, had wealth, and those meere Barbarians as wilde as beasts haue nothing; I intreat your patience to tell you my opinion, which if it be Gods pleasure I shall not liue to put in practice, yet it may be hereafter vsefull for some, but howsoeuer I hope not hurtfull to any,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to subiect all the Saluages in Virginia.</NOTE> and this it is.</P>
<P>Had these three hundred men beene at my disposing, I would haue sent first one hundred to Captaine <HI>Rawley Chroshaw</HI> to <HI>Patawomek,</HI> with some small Ord∣nance for the Fort, the which but with daily exercising them, would haue struck that loue and admiration into the <HI>Patowomeks,</HI> and terror and amazement into his enemies, which are not farre off, and most seated vpon the other side the Ri∣uer, they would willingly haue beene friends, or haue giuen any composition they could, before they would be tormented with such a visible feare.</P>
<P>Now though they be generally persidious, yet necessity constraines those to a kinde of constancy because of their enemies, and neither my selfe that first found them, Captaine <HI>Argall, Chroshow,</HI> nor <HI>Hamar,</HI> neuer found themselues in fifteene yeares trials: nor is it likely now they would haue so hostaged their men, suffer the building of a Fort, and their women and children amongst them, had they intended any villany; but suppose they had, who would haue desired a better aduantage then such an aduertisement, to haue prepared the Fort for such an as∣sault, and surely it must be a poore Fort they could hurt, much more take, if there were but fiue men in it durst discharge a peece: Therefore a man not well know∣ing their conditions, may be as wel too iealous as too carelesse; Such another Lope Skonce would I haue had at <HI>Onawmanient▪</HI> and one hundred men more to haue made such another at <HI>Atquacke</HI> vpon the Riuer of <HI>Toppahanock,</HI> which is not past thirteene miles distant from <HI>Onawmanient:</HI> each of which twelue men would keepe, as well as twelue thousand, and spare all the rest to bee imploied as there should be occasion. And all this with these numbers might easily haue beene done, if not by courtesie, yet by compulsion, especially at that time of Septem∣ber when all their fruits were ripe, their beasts fat, and infinite numbers of wilde Fowle began to repaire to euery creeke, that men if they would doe any thing▪ could not want victuall. This done, there remained yet one hundred who should haue done the like at <HI>Ozinicke,</HI> vpon the Riuer of <HI>Chickahamania,</HI> not past six

miles from the chiefe habitations of <HI>Opechankanough.</HI> These small Forts had beene cause sufficient to cause all the Inhabitants of each of those Riuers to looke to themselues. Then hauing so many Ships, Barks, and Boats in <HI>Virginia</HI> as there was at that present, with what facility might you haue landed two hundred and twentie men, if you had but onely fiue or six Boats in one night; forty to range the branch of <HI>Mattapanyent,</HI> fortie more that of <HI>Youghtanund,</HI> and fortie more to keepe their randiuous at <HI>Pamavuke</HI> it selfe. All which places lie so neere, they might heare from e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch other within foure or fiue houres, and not any of those small parties, if there were any valour, discretion, or industry in them, but as sufficient as foure thousand, to force them all to contribution, or take or spoile all they had. For hauing thus so many conuenient randeuous to beleeue each other, though all the whole Countries had beene our enemies, where could they rest, but in the depth of Winter we might burne all the houses vpon all those Riuers in two or three daies? Then without fires they could not liue, which they could not so hide but wee should finde, and quickly so tire them with watching and warding, they would be so weary of their liues, as either fly all their Countries, or giue all they had to be released of such an hourely misery. Now if but a small number of the Saluages would assist vs, as there is no question but diuers of them would; And so suppose they could not be drawne to such faction; were to beleeue they are more vertuous then many Christians, and the best gouerned people in the world. All the <HI>Pamavukes</HI> might haue beene dispatched as well in a moneth as a yeare, and then to haue dealt with any other enemies at our pleasure, and yet made all this toile and danger but a recreation.</P>
<P>If you think this strange or impossible, 12 men with my selfe I found sufficient, to goe where I would adaies, and surprise a house with the people, if not a whole towne in a night, or incounter all the power they could make, as a whole Army, as formerly at large hath beene related: And it seemes by these small parties last amongst them, by Captaine <HI>Crashow, Hamar,</HI> and <HI>Madyson,</HI> they are not growne to that excellency in policy and courage but they might bee encountred, and their wiues and children apprehended. I know I shall bee taxed for writing so much of my selfe, but I care not much, because the iudiciall know there are few such Souldiers as are my examples, haue writ their owne actions, nor know I who will or can tell my intents better then my selfe.</P>
<P>Some againe finde as much fault with the Company for medling with so many Plantations together, because they that haue many Irons in the fire some must burne; but I thinke no if they haue men enow know how to worke them, but howsoeuer, it were better some burne then haue none at all. The King of <HI>Spaine</HI> re∣gards but how many powerfull Kingdomes he keepes vnder his obedience, and for the Saluage Countries he hath subiected, they are more then enow for a good Cosmographer to nominate, and is three Mole-hills so much to vs; and so many Empires so little for him? For my owne part, I cannot chuse but grieue, that the actions of an Englishman should be inferior to any, and that the command of <HI>England</HI> should not be as great as any Monarchy that euer was since the world began, I meane not as a Tyrant to torment all Christendome, but to suppresse her disturbers, and conquer her enemies.</P>

The ioyfull morning appearing, they found their Boat and goods driue ashore, not farie from them, but so split shee was vnseruiceable: but so much was the frost, their clothes did freeze vpon their backs, for they durst not make any great fire to dry them, lest thereby the bloudy Saluages might discry them, so that one of them died the next day, and the next night digging a graue in the Sands with their hands, buri∣ed him. In this bodily feare they liued and fasted two daies and nights, then two of them went into the Land to seeke fresh water; the others to the Boat to get some meale and oyle, <HI>Argent</HI> and his Comrado found a Canow, in which they re∣solued to aduenture to their ship, but shee was a drift in the Riuer before they re∣turned: thus frustrate of all hopes, Captaine <HI>Butler</HI> the third night ranging the shore in his Boat to seeke them, discharged his Muskets, but they supposing it some Saluages had got some English peeces, they grew more perplexed then euer, so he returned and lost his labour. The fourth day they vnloaded their Boat, and stopping her leakes with their handkerchiefes, and other rags, two rowing, and two bailing out the water; but farre they went not ere the water grew vpon them so fast, and they so tired, they thought themselues happy to be on shore againe, though they perceiued the <HI>Indians</HI> were not farre off by their fires. Thus at the very period of despaire, <HI>Fuller</HI> vndertooke to sit a stride vpon a little peece of an old Canow; so well it pleased God the wind and tide serued, by padling with his hands and feet in the water, beyond all expectation God so guided him three or foure houres vpon this boord, he arriued at their ship, where they no lesse amazed then he tired, they tooke him in. Presently as he had concluded with his Compa∣nions, he caused them discharge a peece of Ordnance if he escaped, which gaue no lesse comfort to Master <HI>Argent</HI> and the rest, then terror to those Plantations that heard it, (being late) at such an vnexpected alarum: but after, with warme clothes and a little strong water, they had a little recouered him, such was his courage and care of his distressed friends, he returned that night againe with Ma∣ster <HI>Felgate</HI> to conduct him to them, and so giuing thanks to God for so hope∣lesse a deliuerance, it pleased his Diuine power, both they and their prouision came safely aboord, but <HI>Fuller</HI> they doubt will neuer recouer his benumbed legs and thighes.</P>

<HEAD>A briefe relation written by Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> to his Maiesties Com∣missioners for the reformation of <HI>Virginia,</HI> concerning some asper∣sions against it.</HEAD>
<P>HOnourable Gentlemen, for so many faire and Nauigable Riuers so neere adioyning, and piercing thorow so faire a naturall Land, free from any inundations, or large Fenny vnwholsome Marshes, I haue not seene, read, nor heard of: And for the building of Cities, Townes, and Wharfage, if they will vse the meanes, where there is no more ebbe nor floud, Nature in few places affoords any so conuenient, for salt Marshes or Quagmires.
<PB N="163" REF="92"/>
In this tract of <HI>Iames</HI> Towne Riuer I know very few; some small Marshes and Swamps there are, but more profitable then hurtfull: and I thinke there is more low Marsh ground betwixt <HI>Eriffe</HI> and <HI>Chelsey,</HI> then <HI>Kecoughton</HI> and the Falls, which is about one hundred and eighty miles by the course of the Riuer.</P>
<P>Being enioyned by our Commission not to vnplant nor wrong the Saluages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The causes of our first miseries.</NOTE> because the channell was so neere the shore, where now is <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, then a thicke groue of trees; wee cut them downe, where the Saluages pretending as much kindnesse as could bee, they hurt and slew one and twenty of vs in two houres: At this time our diet was for most part water and bran, and three ounces of little better stuffe in bread for fiue men a meale, and thus we liued neere three moneths: our lodgings vnder boughes of trees, the Saluages being our enemies, whom we neither knew nor vnderstood; occasions I thinke sufficient to make men sicke and die.</P>
<P>Necessity thus did inforce me with eight or nine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8 English in all <HI>Virginia.</HI></NOTE> to try conclusions amongst the Saluages, that we got prouision which recouered the rest being most sicke. Six weeks I was led captiue by those Barbarians, though some of my men were slaine, and the rest fled, yet it pleased God to make their great Kings daughter the means to returne me safe to <HI>Iames</HI> towne, and releeue our wants, and then our Common∣wealth was in all eight and thirty, the remainder of one hundred and fiue.</P>
<P>Being supplied with one hundred and twenty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proofes of the healthfulnesse of the Countrey.</NOTE> with twelue men in a boat of three tuns, I spent foureteene weeks in those large waters; the contents of the way of my boat protracted by the skale of proportion, was about three thousand miles, besides the Riuer we dwell vpon, where no Christian knowne euer was, and our diet for the most part what we could finde, yet but one died.</P>
<P>The Saluages being acquainted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Salua∣ges became sub∣iected.</NOTE> that by command from <HI>England</HI> we durst not hurt them, were much imboldned; that famine and their insolencies did force me to breake our Commission and instructions, cause <HI>Powhatan</HI> fly his Coun∣trey, and take the King of <HI>Pamavuke</HI> Prisoner; and also to keepe the King of <HI>Pas∣pahegh</HI> in shackels, and put his men to doubletaskes in chaines, till nine and thir∣ty of their Kings paied vs contribution, and the offending Saluages sent to <HI>Iames</HI> towne to punish at our owne discretions: in the two last yeares I staied there, I had not a man slaine.</P>
<P>All those conclusions being not able to preuent the bad euents of pride and idlenesse, hauing receiued another supply of seuentie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How we liued of the natural fruits of the Countrey.</NOTE> we were about two hun∣dred in all, but not twentie work-men: In following the strict directions from <HI>England</HI> to doe that was impossible at that time; So it hapned, that neither wee nor they had any thing to eat, but what the Countrey afforded naturally; yet of eightie who liued vpon Oysters in Iune and Iuly, with a pint of corne a week for a man lying vnder trees, and 120 for the most part liuing vpon Sturgion, which was dried til we pounded it to powder for meale, yet in ten weeks but seuen died.</P>
<P>It is true, we had of Tooles, Armes, &amp; Munition sufficient, some <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> Vi∣neger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proofe of the Commodities we returned.</NOTE> Meale, Pease, and Otemeale, but in two yeares and a halfe not sufficient for six moneths, though by the bils of loading the proportions sent vs, would well haue contented vs, notwithstanding we sent home ample proofes of Pitch, Tar, Sope Ashes, Wainskot, Clapboord, Silke grasse, Iron Ore, some Sturgion and Glasse, Saxefras, Cedar, Cypris, and blacke Walnut, crowned <HI>Powhaton,</HI> sought the <HI>Monacans</HI> Countrey, according to the instructions sent vs, but they caused vs neglect more necessary workes: they had better haue giuen for Pitch and Sope ashes one hundred pound a tun in <HI>Denmarke:</HI> Wee also maintained fiue or six seuerall Plantations.</P>
<P><HI>Iames</HI> towne being burnt, wee rebuilt it and three Forts more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What we built.</NOTE> besides the Church and Store-house, we had about fortie or fiftie seuerall houses to keepe vs warme and dry, inuironed with a palizado of foureteene or fifteene foot, and each as much as three or foure men could carrie. We digged a faire Well of fresh wa∣ter in the Fort, where wee had three Bulwarks, foure and twentie peece of Ord∣nance,
<PB N="164" REF="93"/>
of Culuering, Demiculuering, Sacar and Falcon, and most well mounted vpon conuenient plat-formes, planted one hundred acres of Corne. We had but six ships to transport and supply vs, and but two hundred seuenty seuen men, boies, and women, by whose labours <HI>Ʋirginia</HI> being brought to this kinde of perfection, the most difficulties past, and the foundation thus laid by this small meanes; yet because we had done no more, they called in our Commission, tooke a new in their owne names, and appointed vs neere as many offices and Officers as I had Souldiers, that neither knew vs nor wee them, without our consents or knowledge; since there haue gone more then one hundred ships of other pro∣portions, and eight or ten thousand people. Now if you please to compare what hath beene spent, sent, discouered and done this fifteene yeares, by that we did in the three first yeares, and euery Gouernor that hath beene there since, giue you but such an account as this, you may easily finde what hath beene the cause of those disasters in <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>Then came in Captaine <HI>Argall,</HI> and Master <HI>Sedan,</HI> in a ship of Master <HI>Corneli∣us,</HI> to fish for Sturgion, who had such good prouision, we contracted with them for it, whereby we were better furnished then euer.</P>
<P>Not long after came in seuen ships, with about three hundred people; but ra∣ther to supplant vs then supply vs, their Admirall with their authoritie being cast away in the <HI>Bermudas,</HI> very angry they were we had made no better prouision for them. Seuen or eight weekes we withstood the invndations of these disorderly humors, till I was neere blowne to death with Gun-powder, which occasioned me to returne for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How I left the Country.</NOTE>In the yeare 1609 about Michaelmas, I left the Countrey, as is formerly rela∣ted, with three ships, seuen Boats, Commodities to trade, haruest newly gathe∣red, eight weeks prouision of Corne and Meale, about fiue hundred persons, three hundred Muskets, shot, powder, and match, with armes for more men then we had. The Saluages their language and habitation, well knowne to two hundred expert Souldiers; Nets for fishing, tooles of all sorts, apparell to supply their wants: six Mares and a Horse, fiue or six hundred Swine, many more Powl∣try, what was brought or bred, but victuall there remained.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">My charge.</NOTE>Hauing spent some fiue yeares, and more then fiue hundred pounds in procu∣ring the Letters Patents and setting forward, and neere as much more about <HI>New England,</HI> &amp;c. Thus these nineteene yeares I haue here and there not spared any thing according to my abilitie, nor the best aduice I could, to perswade how those strange miracles of misery might haue beene preuented, which lamentable experience plainly taught me of necessity must insue, but few would beleeue me till now too deerely they haue paid for it. Wherefore hitherto I haue rather left all then vndertake impossibilities, or any more such costly taskes at such chargeable rates:<NOTE PLACE="marg">My reward.</NOTE> for in neither of those two Countries haue I one foot of Land, nor the very house I builded, nor the ground I digged with my owne hands, nor euer any content or satisfaction at all, and though I see ordinarily those two Countries shared before me by them that neither haue them nor knowes them, but by my descriptions: Yet that doth not so much trouble me, as to heare and see those contentions and diuisions which will hazard if not ruine the prosperitie of <HI>Virginia,</HI> if present remedy bee not found, as they haue hindred many hun∣dreds, who would haue beene there ere now, and makes them yet that are willing to stand in a demurre.</P>
<P>For the Books and Maps I haue made, I will thanke him that will shew me so much for so little recompence, and beare with their errors till I haue done better. For the materials in them I cannot deny, but am ready to affirme them both there and here, vpon such grounds as I haue propounded, which is to haue but fifteene hundred men to subdue againe the Saluages, fortifie the Countrey, discouer that yet vnknowne, and both defend &amp; feed their Colony, which I most humbly refer to his Maiesties most iudiciall iudgement, and the most honourable Lords of his
<PB N="165" REF="93"/>
Priuy Councell, you his trusty and well-beloued Commissioners, and the Ho∣nourable company of Planters and well-willers to <HI>Ʋirginia, New-England</HI> and <HI>Sommer-Ilands.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Out of these Obseruations it pleased his Maiesties Commissioners for the reformation of <HI>Virginia,</HI> to desire my answer to these seuen Questions.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>WHat conceiue you is the cause the Plantation hath pro∣spered no better since you left it in so good a forward∣nesse?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Idlenesse and carelesnesse brought all I did in three yeeres in six moneths to nothing, and of fiue hundred I left, scarce threescore remained, and had Sir <HI>Thomas Gates</HI> not got from the <HI>Bermudas,</HI> I thinke they had beene all dead before they could be supplied.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>What conceiue you should be the cause, though the Country be good, there comes nothing but Tobacco</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The oft altering of Gouernours it seemes causes euery man make vse of his time, and because Corne was stinted at two shillings six pence the bushell, and Tobacco at three shillings the pound, and they value a mans labour a yeere worth fifty or threescore pound, but in Corne not worth ten pound, presuming Tobacco will furnish them with all things; now make a mans labour in Corne worth threescore pound, and in Tobacco but ten pound a man, then shall they haue Corne sufficient to entertaine all commers, and keepe their people in health to doe any thing, but till then, there will be little or nothing to any purpose.</P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>What conceiue you to haue beene the cause of the Massacre, and had the Saluages had the vse of any peeces in your time, or when, or by whom they were taught</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The cause of the Massacre was the want of marshall discipline, and be∣cause they would haue all the English had by destroying those they found so carelesly secure, that they were not prouided to defend themselues against any enemy, being so dispersed as they were. In my time, though Captaine <HI>Nuport</HI> furnished them with swords by truck, and many fugitiues did the like, and some Peeces they got accidentally, yet I got the most of them againe, and it was death to him that should shew a Saluage the vse of a Peece. Since I vnderstand they be∣came so good shot, they were imployed for Fowlers and Huntsmen by the English.</P>
<P>Quest. 4. <HI>What charge thinke you would haue setled the gouernment both for de∣fence and planting when you left it</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Twenty thousand pound would haue hyred good labourers and me∣chanicall men, and haue furnished them with cattle and all necessaries, and 100. of them would haue done more then a thousand of those that went, though the Lord <HI>Laware,</HI> Sir <HI>Ferdinando Waynman,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Gates</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Dale</HI> were perswaded to the contrary, but when they had tried, they confessed their error.</P>
<P>Quest. 5. <HI>What conceiue you would be the remedy and the charge?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The remedy is to send Souldiers and all sorts of labourers and necessa∣ries for them, that they may be there by next <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> the which to doe well will stand you in fiue thousand pound, but if his Maiesty would please to lend two of his Ships to transport them, lesse would serue, besides the benefit of his grace to the action would encourage all men.</P>
<P>Quest. 6. <HI>What thinke you are the defects of the gouernment both here and there?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The multiplicity of opinions here, and Officers there, makes such delaies by questions and formalitie, that as much time is spent in complement as in acti∣on;
<PB N="166" REF="94"/>
besides, some are so desirous to imploy their ships, hauing six pounds for euery Passenger, and three pounds for euery tun of goods, at which rate a thou∣sand ships may now better be procured then one at the first, when the common stocke defrayed all fraughts, wages, prouisions and Magazines, whereby the Ships are so pestred, as occasions much sicknesse, diseases and mortality, for though all the Passengers die they are sure of their fraught; and then all must be satisfied with Orations, disputations, excuses and hopes. As for the letters of ad∣uice from hence, and their answers thence, they are so well written, men would be∣leeue there were no great doubt of the performance, and that all things were wel, to which error here they haue beene euer much subiect; and there not to beleeue, or not to releeue the true and poore estate of that Colony, whose fruits were common∣ly spent before they were ripe, and this losse is nothing to them here, whose great estates are not sensible of the losse of their aduentures, and so they thinke; or will not take notice; but it is so with all men: but howsoeuer they thinke or dispose of all things at their pleasure, I am sure not my selfe onely, but a thousand others haue not onely spent the most of their estates, but the most part haue lost their liues and all, onely but to make way for the triall of more new conclusions, and he that now will aduenture but twelue pounds ten shillings, shall haue better re∣spect and as much fauour then he that sixteene yeere agoe aduentured as much, ex∣cept he haue money as the other hath, but though he haue aduentured fiue hun∣dred pound, and spent there neuer so much time, if hee haue no more and not able to begin a family of himselfe, all is lost by order of Court.</P>
<P>But in the beginning it was not so, all went then out of one purse, till those new deuices haue consumed both mony and purse; for at first there were but six Pa∣tentees, now more then a thousand, then but thirteene Counsailors, now not lesse then an hundred; I speake not of all, for there are some both honourable and honest, but of those Officers, which did they manage their owne estates no better then the affaires of <HI>Virginia,</HI> they would quickly fall to decay so well as it; but this is most euident, few Officers in <HI>England</HI> it hath caused to turne Ban∣querupts, nor for all their complaints would leaue their places, neither yet any of their Officers there, nor few of the rest but they would be at home, but fewer Aduenturers here will aduenture any more till they see the businesse better esta∣blished, although there be some so wilfully improuident they care for nothing but to get thither, and then if their friends be dead, or want themselues, they die or liue but poorely for want of necessaries, and to thinke the old Planters can re∣leeue them were too much simplicity; for who here in <HI>England</HI> is so charitable to feed two or three strangers, haue they neuer so much; much lesse in <HI>Virginia</HI> where they want for themselues. Now the generall complaint saith, that pride, co∣uetousnesse, extortion and oppression in a few that ingrosses all, then sell all againe to the comminalty at what rate they please, yea euen men, women and children for who will giue most, occasions no small mischiefe amongst the Planters.</P>
<P>As for the Company, or those that doe transport them, prouided of necessaries, God forbid but they should receiue their charges againe with aduantage, or that masters there should not haue the same priuilege ouer their seruants as here, but to sell him or her for forty, fifty, or threescore pounds, whom the Company hath sent ouer for eight or ten pounds at the most, without regard how they shall be maintained with apparell, meat, drinke and lodging, is odious, and their fruits sutable, therefore such merchants it were better they were made such merchan∣dize themselues, then suffered any longer to vse that trade, and those are de∣fects sufficient to bring a well setled Common-wealth to misery, much more <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 7. <HI>How thinke you it may be rectified?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> If this Maiestie would please to intitle it to his Crowne, and yearely that both the Gouernours here and there may giue their accounts to you, or some that are not ingaged in the businesse, that the common stocke bee not spent in
<PB N="167" REF="94"/>
maintaining one hundred men for the Gouernour, one hundred for two De∣puties, fifty for the Treasurer, fiue and twenty for the Secretary, and more for the Marshall and other Officers who were neuer there nor aduentured any thing, but onely preferred by fauour to be Lords ouer them that broke the ice and beat the path, and must teach them what to doe, if any thing happen well, it is their glory; if ill, the fault of the old directors, that in all dangers must endure the worst, yet not fiue hundred of them haue so much as one of the others; also that there bee some present course taken to maintaine a Garrison to suppresse the Saluages, till they be able to subsist, and that his Maiesty would please to remit his custome, or it is to be feared they will lose custome and all, for this cannot be done by promi∣ses, hopes, counsels and countenances, but with sufficient workmen and meanes to maintaine them, not such delinquents as here cannot be ruled by all the lawes in <HI>England,</HI> yet when the foundation is laid, as I haue said, and a common-wealth established, then such there may better be constrained to labour then here: but to rectifie a common-wealth with debaushed people is impossible, and no wise man would throw himselfe into such a society, that intends honestly, and knowes what he vndertakes, for there is no Country to pillage as the Romans found: all you expect from thence must be by labour.</P>
<P>For the gouernment I thinke there is as much adoe about it as the Kingdomes of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> men here conceiting <HI>Virginia</HI> as they are, erecting as ma∣ny stately Offices as Officers with their attendants, as there are labourers in the Countrey, where a Constable were as good as twenty of their Captaines, and three hundred good Souldiers and labourers better then all the rest that goe onely to get the fruits of other mens labours by the title of an office. Thus they spend <HI>Michaelmas</HI> rent in <HI>Mid-summer</HI> Moone, and would gather their Haruest before they haue planted their Corne.</P>
<P>As for the maintenance of the Officers, the first that went neuer demanded any, but aduentured good summes, and it seemes strange to me, the fruits of all their labours, besides the expence of an hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and such multitudes of people, those collaterall Officers could not maintaine them∣selues so well as the old did, and hauing now such liberty to doe to the Saluages what they will, the others had not. I more then wonder they haue not fiue hun∣dred Saluages to worke for them towards their generall maintenance, and as many more to returne some content and satisfaction to the Aduenturers, that for all their care, charge and diligence, can heare nor see nothing but miserable com∣plaints; therefore vnder your correction to rectifie all, is with all expedition to passe the authority to them who will releeue them, lest all bee consumed ere the differences be determined. And except his Maiestie vndertake it, or by Act of Parlament some small tax may be granted throughout his Dominions, as a Penny vpon euery Poll, called a head-penny; two pence vpon euery Chimney, or some such collection might be raised, and that would be sufficient to giue a good stocke, and many seruants to sufficient men of any facultie, and transport them freely for paying onely homage to the Crowne of <HI>England,</HI> and such duties to the publike good as their estates increased reason should require. Were this put in practice, how many people of what quality you please, for all those disasters would yet gladly goe to spend their liues there, and by this meanes more good might be done in one yeere, then all those pety particular vndertakings will effect in twenty.</P>
<P>For the Patent the King may, if he please, rather take it from them that haue it, then from vs who had it first, pretending to his Maiesty what great matters they would doe, and how little we did, and for any thing I can conceiue, had we remained still as at first, it is not likely we could haue done much worse; but those oft altering of gouernments are not without much charge, hazard and losse.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE GENERALL HISTORIE OF THE BERMVDAS, now called the <HI>Summer Iles,</HI> from their beginning in the yeere of our Lord 1593. to this present 1624. with their proceedings, accidents and present estate.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Efore we present you the matters of fact, it is fit to offer to your view the Stage whereon they were acted, for as Geography without History seemeth a carkasse without motion, so History without Geography, wandreth as a Vagrant without a certaine habitation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The description of the Iles.</NOTE> Those Ilands lie in the huge maine Ocean, and two hundred leagues from any continent, situated in 32. degrees and 25. mi∣nutes, of Northerly latitude, and distant from <HI>England</HI> West South-West, about 3300. miles, some twenty miles in length, and not past two miles and a halfe in breadth, enuironed with Rocks, which to the North-ward, West-ward, and South-East, extend further then they haue bin yet well discouered: by reason of those Rocks the Country is naturally very strong, for there is but two places, &amp; scare two, vnlesse to them who know them well, where shipping may safely come in, and those now are excee∣ding well fortified, but within is roome to entertaine a royall Fleet: the Rocks in most places appeare at a low water, neither are they much couered at a high, for it ebbs and flowes not past fiue foot; the shore for most part is a Rocke, so hardened with the sunne, wind and sea, that it is not apt to be worne away with the waues, whose violence is also broke by the Rocks before they can come to the shore: it is very vneuen, distributed into hills and dales; the mold is of diuers colours, nei∣ther clay nor sand, but a meane betweene; the red which resembleth clay is the worst, the whitest resembling sand and the blackest is good, but the browne be∣twixt them both which they call white, because there is mingled with it a white meale is the best: vnder the mould two or three foot deep, and sometimes lesse, is a kinde of white hard substance which they call the Rocke: the trees vsually fasten their roots in it; neither is it indeed rocke or stone, or so hard, though for most part more harder then Chalke; nor so white, but pumish-like and spungy, easily receiuing and containing much water. In some places Clay is found vnder it, it seemes to be ingendred with raine water, draining through the earth, and draw∣ing with it of his substance vnto a certaine depth where it congeales; the hardest kinde of it lies vnder the red ground like quarries, as it were thicke slates one vp∣on another, through which the water hath his passage, so that in such places there is scarce found any fresh water, for all or the most part of the fresh water commeth out of the Sea draining through the sand, or that substance called the Rocke, lea∣uing the salt behinde, it becomes fresh: sometimes we digged wells of fresh water which we finde in most places, and but three or foure paces from the Sea side, some further, the most part of them would ebbe and flow as the Sea did; and be le∣uell or little higher then the superficies of the sea, and in some places very strange, darke and cumbersome Caues.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="96"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The clime, tem∣per and fertility.</NOTE>The aire is most commonly cleere, very temperate, moist, with a moderate heat, very healthfull and apt for the generation and nourishing of all things, so as ma∣ny things transported from hence yeeld a farre greater increase, and if it be any li∣uing thing it becomes fatter and better; by this meanes the country is so reple∣nished with Hens and Turkies, within the space of three or foure yeeres, that ma∣ny of them being neglected, forsake the houses and become wilde, and so liue in great abundance; the like increase there is in Hogs, tame Conies, and other Cattle according to their kindes. There seemes to be a continuall Spring, which is the cause some things come not to that maturity and perfection as were requi∣site; and though the trees shed their leaues, yet they are alwaies full of greene; the Corne is the same they haue in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the <HI>West-Indies</HI>: of this and many other things without plowing or much labour, they haue two Haruests euery yeere, for they set about March, which they gather in Iuly; and againe in August, which they reape in December; and little slips of Fig-trees and Vines doe vsually beare fruit within the yeere, and sometimes in lesse; but we finde not the Grapes as yet come to any perfection; the like fertility it hath in Oranges and Limons, Pomgranates, and other things. Concerning the serenity and beauty of the skie, it may as truly be said of those Ilands as euer it was said of the Rhodes, that there is no one day throughout the 12. moneths, but that in some houre thereof, the sun lookes singularly &amp; cleere vpon them: for the temperature it is beyond all others most admirable; no cold there is beyond an English Aprill, nor heat much grea∣ter then an ordinary Iuly in <HI>France,</HI> so that frost and snow is neuer seene here, nor stinking and infectious mists very seldome, by reason of the maine Ocean, there is some wind stirring that cooles the aire: the winter they haue obserues the time with ours, but the longest daies and nights are shorter then ours almost by two houres.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees and Fruits.</NOTE>We found it at first all ouergrowne with weeds, and plants of seuerall kinds, as many tall and goodly Cedars, infinite store of Palmetoes, numbers of Mulberies, wild Oliue-trees store, with diuers others vnknowne both by name and nature, so that as yet they become lost to many vsefull imployments, which time and in∣dustry no doubt will one day discouer, and euen already certaine of the most no∣torious of them haue gotten them appellations from their apparent effects, as the Prickell-peare which growes like a shrub by the ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prickell Peare.</NOTE> with broad thick leaues, all ouer-armed with long and sharpe dangerous thornes, the fruit being in forme not much vnlike a small greene Peare, and on the outside of the same colour, but within bloud red, and exceeding full of iuice; with graines not much vnlike the Pomgranat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The poison weed.</NOTE> and colouring after its nature. The poysoned weed is much in shape like our English Iuy, but being but touched, causeth rednesse, itching, and lastly blisters, the which howsoeuer after a while passe away of themselues without further harme, yet because for the time they are somewhat painfull, it hath got it selfe an ill name, although questionlesse of no ill nature. Here is also frequently growing a certaine tall Plant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The red weed.</NOTE> whose stalke being all ouer couered with a red rinde, is thereupon termed the red weed, the root whereof being soked in any li∣quor, or but a small quantity of the Iuice drunke alone, procures a very forcible vomit, and yet is generally vsed by the people, and found very effectuall against the paines and distempers of the stomacke.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The purging Beane.</NOTE>A kinde of Wood-bind there is likewise by the Sea very commonly to bee found, which runnes vpon trees twining it selfe like a Vine: the fruit somewhat resembles a Beane, but somewhat flatter, the which any way eaten worketh ex∣cellently in the nature of a purge, and though very vehemently, yet without all perill.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The costiue tree.</NOTE> Contrary to this, another small tree there is, which causeth costiuenesse; there is also a certaine Plant like a bramble bush, which beares a long yellow fruit, hauing the shell very hard, and within it a hard berry, that beaten and taken in∣wardly purgeth gently.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Red Pepper.</NOTE> There is another fruit much like our Barberies, which being beaten or brused betweene the teeth, sets all the mouth on an extreme heat very terrible for the time, to auoid which they are swallowed downe whole,
<PB N="171" REF="96"/>
and found of the same or better operation then the red Pepper, and thence bor∣roweth the name. In the bottome of the Sea there is growing vpon the Rocks a large kinde of Plant in the forme of a Vine leafe, but far more spread with veines in colour of a pale red, very strangely interlaced &amp; wouen one into another, which we call the Feather, but the vertue thereof is altogether vnknowne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sea feather.</NOTE> but only regar∣ded for the rarity. Now besides these naturall productions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruits transpor∣ted.</NOTE> prouidences &amp; paines since the Plantation, haue offered diuers other feeds &amp; plants, which the soile hath greedlily imbraced &amp; cherished, so that at this present 1623. there are great abun∣dance of white, red and yellow coloured Potatoes, Tobacco, Sugarcanes, Indicos, Parsnips, exceeding large R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dishes, the American bread, the Cassado root, the In∣dian Pumpian, the Water-millon, Musk-millon, &amp; the most delicate Pine-apples, Plantans, and Papawes, also the English Artichoke, Pease, &amp;c. briefly whatsoeuer else may be expected for the satisfaction either of curiosity, necessity or delight.</P>
<P>Neither hath the aire for her part been wanting with due supplies of many sorts of Fowles, as the gray and white Hearne, the gray and greene Plouer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds.</NOTE> some wilde Ducks and Malards, Coots and Red-shankes, Sea-wigions, Gray-bitterns, Cor∣morants, numbers of small Birds like Sparrowes and Robins, which haue lately beene destroyed by the wilde Cats, Wood-pickars, very many Crowes, which since this Plantation are kild, the rest fled or seldome seene except in the most vn∣inhabited places, from whence they are obserued to take their flight about sun set, directing their course towards the North-west, which makes many coniecture there are some more Ilands not far off that way. Sometimes are also seene Falcons &amp; Iar-falcons, Ospraies, a Bird like a Hobby, but because they come seldome, they are held but as passengers; but aboue all these, most deseruing obseruation and respect are those two sorts of Birds, the one for the tune of his voice, the other for the effect, called the Cahow, and Egge▪bird, which on the first of May, a day con∣stantly obserued, fall a laying infinite store of Eggs neere as big as Hens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Egge-Birds.</NOTE> vpon certaine small sandie baies especially in <HI>Coupers</HI> Ile; and although men sit downe amongst them when hundreds haue bin gathered in a morning, yet there is hath stayed amongst them till they haue gathered as many more: they continue this course till <HI>Midsummer,</HI> and so tame &amp; feareles, you must thrust them off from their Eggs with your hand; then they grow so faint with laying, they suffer them to breed &amp; take infinite numbers of their yong to eat, which are very excellent meat.</P>
<P>The Cahow is a Bird of the night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cahowes.</NOTE> for all the day she lies hid in holes in the Rocks, where they and their young are also taken with as much ease as may be, but in the night if you but whoop and hollow, they will light vpon you, that with your hands you may chuse the fat and leaue the leane; those they haue only in winter: their Eggs are as big as hens, but they are speckled, the other white. M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Norwood</HI> hath taken twenty dozen of them in three or foure houres, and since there hath beene such hauocke made of them, they were neere all destroyed, till there was a strict inhibition for their preseruation. The Tropicke bird is white,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tropicke Bird and the Pemblicos pre∣sagements.</NOTE> as large as a Pullet, with one onely long Feather in her taile, and is seldome seene far distant from other of the Tropicks: another small Bird there is, because she cries Pemblyco they call her so, she is seldome seene in the day but when she sings, as too oft she doth very clamorously; too true a Prophet she proues of huge winds and boysterous weather: there were a kinde of small Owles in great abundance, but they are now all slaine or fled: some tame Ducks, Geese and Pigeons there are, but the two latter prosper not.</P>
<P>Concerning vermine and noisome creatures, there are not many,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Vermine.</NOTE> but onely Rats and Cats, there increased since the Plantation, but how they agree together you shall heare hereafter. The Musketas and Flies are also too busie, with a cer∣taine India Bug, called by the Spaniards a Cacarootch, the which creeping into Chests they eat and defile with their ill-sented dung: also the little Ants in sum∣mer time are so troublesome, they are forced to dry their figs vpon high frames▪ and anoint their feet with tar, wherein they sticke, else they would spoile them all
<PB N="172" REF="97"/>
ere they could be dryed: Wormes in the earth also there are, but too many, so that to keepe them from destroying their Corne and Tobacco, they are forced to worme them euery morning, which is a great labour, else all would be destroyed. Lizards there were many and very large, but now none, and it is laid they were destroyed by the Cat.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> Certaine Spiders also of very large size are found hanging vpon trees, but instead of being any way dangerous as in other places, they are here of a most pleasing aspect, all ouer drest, as it were with Siluer, Gold, and Pearle, and their Webs in the Summer wouen from tree to tree, are generally a perfect raw silke, and that as well in regard of substance as colour, and so strong withall, that diuers Birds bigger than Black-birds, being like Snipes, are often ta∣ken and snared in them as a Net: then what would the Silke-worme doe were she<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there to feede vpon the continuall greene Mulbery?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ashes.</NOTE>But aboue all the rest of the Elements, the Sea is found most abundantly libe∣rall: hence haue they as much excellent Fish, and as much variety as need be de¦sired. The most of which being vnknowne to our Northerne parts, got there new names, either for their shapes or conditions; as the large Rocke-fish from his like hew, and haunting amongst the Rocks, the fat Hog-fish from his swine-like shape and shout: for this is not the old knowne Hog-fish with brussels on his backe; the delicate Amber-fish from his taste and smell, Angell-fish, Cony-fish, the small yellow taile from that naturall painting; the great Growper from his odde and strange grunting, some of them yet knowne to the <HI>Americans,</HI> as the Purgoose, the Cauallo, the Gar-fish, Flying-fish and Morerayes: the rest are com∣mon to other Continents; as the Whale in great numbers, the Sharke, the Pilot-fish, the Sea-Breame, the Oyster and Lobster, with diuers others; twenty Tor∣toises haue beene taken in a day, and some of them will affoord halfe a bushell of Egges, and suffice to feed forty men at a meale. And thus haue you briefely epito∣mized Mother Natures benefits to this little, yet dainty spot of earth, neither were it ingenuity to conceale wherein shee inclineth to the Stepdame, especially since the particulars are so few, as rather requisite Antidotes against idlenesse to rouse vp industry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The most hurt∣full things in those Iles.</NOTE> then any great cause of much distaste, much lesse despaire: and of those to speake troth, there are onely two: <HI>viz.</HI> the Winds, and the Wormes, especially in the Spring and Autumne; and thus conditioned as yet we will let rest these small Ilands, in the midst of this mightie and maine Ocean, so inuiro∣ned on euery side, by infinite numbers of vncertaine scattered Rocks, lying shal∣lowly hid vnder the surface of the water, a league, two, three, foure, or fiue, to Sea, to the which aduantagers added by art, as hereafter you shall heare at large, and finde described in the Map. It may well be concluded to be the most impregna∣ble place in the world, and although the Amber Greece, Pearles, nor Tobacco, are of that quantity and certainty to be relied vpon to gaine wealth; yet by pra∣ctise and experience they finde, by Silke, Saffron, Indico, Madar, Sugar-canes, Wine, Oile, and such like great profit may be expected: yet were those hopelesse in regard of their conueniency to nourish and maintaine themselues, and releeue them shall visit them with wood, water, and other necessaries, besides what an eye-sore they are already becommed to them that haue them not, and how deare and pretious to them that haue them, I thinke none will deny but they are well worth the keeping: and so we will proceed to the accidents that befell the first finders; also the proceedings of the first Planters and their successors, Master <HI>Nor∣rod, Thomas Sparkes,</HI> and diuers others.</P>

further then thus; our men found diuers crosses, peeces of Spanish monies here and there. Two or three wracks also they found, by certaine inscriptions to bee some Spanish, some Dutch, some French; but the greatest rumour is, that a Spanish ship called <HI>Bermudas</HI> was there cast away, carrying Hogges to the West-Indies that swam a shore, and there increased: how the <HI>Spaniards</HI> escaped is vn∣certaine: but they say, from that ship those Iles were first called <HI>Bermudas,</HI> which tilt then for six thousand yeares had beene namelesse.</P>
<P>But the first English-man that was euer in them, was one <HI>Henry May,</HI> a worthy Mariner that went with Captaine <HI>Lancaster</HI> to the East-Indies 1591. and in their returne by the West-Indies, being in some distresse, sent this <HI>Henry May</HI> for England by one <HI>Mounsier de la Barbotier,</HI> to acquaint the Merchants with their estate. The last of Nouember, saith <HI>May,</HI> we departed from <HI>Laguna</HI> in <HI>Hispa∣niola,</HI> and the seuenteenth of December following, we were cast away vpon the North-west of the <HI>Bermudas</HI>; the Pilots about noone made themselues South∣wards of the Iles twelue leagues, and demanded of the Captaine their Wine of hight as out of all danger, which they had: but it seeme, they were either drunke, or carelesse of their charge; for through their negligences a number of good men were cast away. I being but a stranger amongst fiftie and odde French-men, it pleased God to appoint me to be one of them should be saued. In this extremity we made a raft, which we towed with our Boat, there were but six and twentie of vs saued; and I seeing scarce roome for the one halfe, durst not passe in amongst them till the Captaine called me along with him, leauing the better halfe to the seas mercy: that day we rowed till within two houres of night ere we could land, being neere dead with thirst, euery man tooke his way to seeke fresh water, at length, by searching amongst many weeds, we found some raine water, but in the maine are many faire Baies, where we had enough for digging.</P>
<P>Now it pleased God before our ship split we saued our Carpenters tooles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The building and calking their Barke.</NOTE> some Nailes, Sailes, and Tacklings, wherewith we went roundly to worke, and built a Barke of eighty tunues: In stead of Pitch, we made Lime, mixed with Tortoise oyle, and as the Carpenters calked her, I and another paied the seames with this plaster, which being in Aprill, became quickly dry, and as hard as a stone.</P>
<P>In Aprill it was so hot, we feared our water would faile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His returne for England.</NOTE> two great Chests wee made, which we calked as our ship; those we stowed on each side our maine Mast, filled them with water and thirtie liue Tortoises: wee found many Hogges, but so leane wee could not eat them; the tops of the Palmetaberries was our bread, and the iuyce we got out of the trees we cut downe our drinke, and of the leaues, which are more then an Ell long, we couered our Cabens, &amp; made our beds, and found many of those prouisions as is related, but little foule weather. The ele∣uenth of May it pleased God to set vs cleere of the Ile, after wee had liued there fiue moneths: and the twentieth wee fell with Cape <HI>Britton,</HI> neere <HI>New found Land,</HI> where refreshing our selues with wood and water, and such things as we could get of the Saluages, it seemed a good Countrey, but we staied not past foure houres before we set saile for the banke of <HI>New found land,</HI> where wee met many ships, but not any would take in a man of vs, vntill it pleased God we met a Barke of <HI>Fawmothe,</HI> which receiued vs for a little time, and with her we tooke a French ship, wherein I left Captaine <HI>de la Barbotier,</HI> my deare friend, and all his Com∣pany: and in August arriued at <HI>Falmouth</HI> in this honest English Barke, 1594.</P>

<P>YOu haue heard, that when Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> was Gouernor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> there were nine ships sent with Sir <HI>Thomas Gates,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Somers,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Nuport</HI> with fiue hundred people, to take in the old Com∣mission, and rectifie a new gouernment: they set saile in May, and in the height of thirty degrees of Northerly latitude, they were taken with an ex∣treme storme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A most desperate estate by a storm.</NOTE> or rather a part of <HI>Hericano,</HI> vpon the fiue and twentieth of Iuly, which as they write, did not onely separate them from the Fleet, but with the vio∣lent working of the Seas, their ship became so shaken, torne, and leake, she recei∣ued so much water as couered two tire of Hogsheads aboue the ballace, that they stood vp to the middles, with Buckets, Baricos, and Kettles, to baile out the wa∣ter. Thus bailing and pumping three daies and three nights without
intermissi∣on, and yet the water seemed rather to increase then diminish, in so much that being all vtterly spent with labour, were euen resolued without any hope to shut vp the hatches, and commit themselues to the mercy of the Sea, which is said to be mercilesse, or rather to the mercy of Almighty God, whose mercy farre ex∣ceeds all his workes; seeing no sense or hope in mans apprehension, but present∣ly to sinke: some hauing some good and comfortable waters, fetched them and dranke one to another, as taking their last leaues vntill a more happy, and a more ioyfull meeting in a more blessed world, when it pleased God out of his most gracious and mercifull prouidence, so to direct and guide their ship for her most aduantage;</P>

M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Shelly</HI> found a Bay neere a quarter of a mile ouer, so full of Mul∣lets, as none of them before had euer seene or heard of the like: the next day seeking to kill them with fis-gigs, they stracke so many the water in many places was red with bloud, yet caught not one, but with a net they caught so many as they could draw a shore, with infinite number of Pilchards and diuers other sorts; great craw-fishes in a night by making a fire they haue taken in great quantity. Sir <HI>George</HI> had twice his hooke and line broke out of his hand, but the third time he made it so strong he caught the same fish, which had pulled him into the Sea had not his men got hold of him, whereby he had his three hookes againe were found in her belly.

At last they began to recouer their wits, yet in a fashion perhaps would haue cost them dearer then when they were mad; for concluding a tripartite peace of their Marachin warre, they resolued to frame as good a Boat as they could, and therein to make a desperate attempt for <HI>Ʋirginia,</HI> or <HI>New found Land</HI>; but no sooner were they entred into that resolution, but they descried a saile standing in for the shore, though they neither knew what she was, nor what she would, they were so ouer-ioyed, with all possible speed they went to meet her, and according to their hearts desire she proued an English-man, whom they safely conducted into their harbour.</P>

<P>Before this yeere was expired, the aduenterers sent them an <HI>aduiso</HI> with thirtie Passengers and good prouisions, to prepare with all expedition for their defence against the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> whom they vnderstood ere long would visit them: This oc∣casioned him to keepe all his men together in that Ile so hard at worke, that wan∣ting libertie to goe abroad for food, liuing onely on that they had, and expected daily to receiue from <HI>England,</HI> they were so ouer-toiled, many fell sicke, but none died.

About this time they were in hope of a small crop of To∣bacco, but it was most spoiled for want of knowledge to vse it. Now in <HI>England</HI> Master <HI>More</HI> became amongst the Merchants maruelous distastfull, for the de∣taining so long the Amber-greece; which delaies they so much abhorred, they forthwith dispatched the <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the second time and forty Passengers, much rebuking <HI>More</HI> for so long detaining the Amber-greece: for the which, hauing now no more colourable excuses, he deliuered it, wherewith the ship went to <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> &amp; thence home. In this ship was brought the first Potato roots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange in∣crease of Pota∣toes.</NOTE> which flou∣rished exceedingly for a time, till by negligence they were almost lost (all but two cast-away roots) that so wonderfully haue increased, they are a maine releefe to all the Inhabitants.

<P>This feare thus past, appeares another much worse, which was the extremity of famine; in this extemity God sent Captaine <HI>Daniel Elfrid</HI> with a caruell of meale which a little relieued them, but brought withall so many Rats, that with∣in two yeeres after neere ruined all; now though <HI>Elfrid</HI> had deceiued his friend <HI>Fisher</HI> of this Caruell in the <HI>West.

<P><MILESTONE N="1614"/> The neglect of this diuision was very hardly conceited in <HI>England,</HI> so that Master <HI>More</HI> grew more and more in dislike with the company;<NOTE PLACE="marg"> A great famine and mortalitie.

<P><MILESTONE N="1615"/> THE first thing they did was casting of lots, who should rule first,<NOTE PLACE="marg"> Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> Treasurer.</NOTE> which lot lighted vpon Master <HI>Caldicot.</HI> This last supply somewhat abated the extremitie of their miseries, and the better in that their fortifications be∣ing finished, they had the more leasure to goe abroad with that meanes was brought to that purpose to fish. <HI>Chard</HI> as you haue heard, whom all this while <HI>More</HI> had kept Prisoner, they set at libertie: now by reason of their former mise∣ries, little or nothing could be done; yet this Gouernor hauing thus concluded his moneth, and prepared a Frigot and two and thirtie men, hee imbarked him∣selfe with two other of his fellow counsellers; namely, <HI>Knight</HI> and <HI>Waters</HI> for the West-Indies, to get Fruits and Plants, Goats, young Cattle, and such like. But this poore vessell, whether through ill weather, or want of Mariners, or both, in stead of the <HI>Indies</HI> fell with the <HI>Canaries,</HI> where taking a poore <HI>Portugall▪</HI> the which they manned with ten of their owne people, as soone after separated from her in a storme, &amp; the next day was taken by a French Pickaroune, so that the Fri∣got out of hope of her prize, makes a second time for the West-Indies, where she no sooner arriued, but foundred in the sea; but the men in their Boat recouered a desolate ile, where after some few moneths stay, an English Pyrat tooke them in, and some of them at last got for <HI>England,</HI> and some few yeares after returned to the <HI>Somer Iles.</HI></P>

Then the matter fell so hotly againe to be disputed betwixt him and one Master <HI>Keath</HI> a Scotch-man, that professed schol∣lership, that made all the people in a great combustion: much adoe there was, till at last as they sate in the Church and ready to proceed to a iudiciary course against Master <HI>Hues,</HI> suddenly such an extreme gust of wind and weather so ruffled in the trees and Church; some cried out, A miracle; others, it was but an accident common in those Iles, but the noise was so terrible it dissolued the assembly▪ not∣withstanding, Master <HI>Hues</HI> was againe imprisoned, and as suddenly discharged; but those factions were so confused, and their relations so variable, that such vnnecessary circumstances were better omitted then any more disputed.</P>

many of the Company repaired to Master <HI>Hues,</HI> that there might bee a Coun∣cell according to Master <HI>Mores</HI> order of six Gouernours, and twelue Assistants; whereupon grew as many more such silly brawles as before, which at last con∣cluded with as simple a reconciliation. In the <HI>interim</HI> happened to a certaine number of priuate persons as miserable and lamentable an accident, as euer was read or heard of, and thus it was:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonderfull accident.</NOTE>In the month of March, a time most subiect of all others to such tempests; on a Friday there went seuen men in a boat of two or three runnes to fish. The mor∣ning being faire, so eager they were of their iourney, some went fasting: neither carried they either meat or drinke with them, but a few Palmeta berries, but be∣ing at their fishing place some foure leagues from the shoare, such a tempest arose, they were quickly driuen from the sight of land in an ouergrowne Sea, despairing of all hope, onely committing themselues to Gods mercy, set the boat driue which way shee would. On Sunday the storme being somewhat abated, they hoysed saile as they thought towards the Island. In the euening it grew starke calme; to that being too weake to vse their oares, they lay a drift that night. The next mor∣ning <HI>Andrew Hilliard,</HI> for now all his companions were past strength either to helpe him or themselues: before a small gale of wind spred his saile againe. On Tuesday one died, whom they threw ouer board. On Wednesday three. And on Thursday at night the sixt. All these but the last were buried by <HI>Hilliard</HI> in the Sea, for so weake hee was growne hee could not turne him ouer as the rest, whereupon hee stripped him, ripping his belly with his knife, throwing his bow∣els into the water, hee spread his body abroad tilted open with a sticke, and so lets it lie as a cisterne to receiue some lucky raine-water, and this God sent h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m presently after, so that in one small shoure hee recouered about foure spoonefuls of raine water to his vnspeakeable refreshment; he also preserued neere halfe a pint of blood in a shooe, which he did sparingly drinke of to moist his mouth: two seue∣rall dates he fed on his flesh, to the quantity of a pound, on the eleuenth day from his losing the sight of land, two flying fishes fals in his boat, whose warme iucie blood hee sucked to his great comfort. But within an houre after to his greater comfort you will not doubt, he once againe descried the land, and within foure houres after was cast vpon a rocke neere to Port royall, where his boat was pre∣sently split in pieces, but himselfe, though exreamly weake, made shift to clamber vp so steepe and high a rocke, as would haue troubled the ablest man in the Ile to haue done that by day hee did by night.</P>
<P>Being thus astride on a rocke, the tumbling Sea had gotten such poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion in his braines, that a good while it was before his giddy head would suffer him to venture vpon the forsaking it: towards the morning he craules a shore, and then to his accomplished ioy descernes where hee is, and trauels halfe a day without a∣ny refreshment then water, whereof wisely and temperately he stinted himselfe, otherwise certainely hee had drunke his last. In which case hee attaines a friends house: where at the first they tooke him for a ghost, but at last acknowledged and receiued him with ioy, his story after some houres of recouery of strength to tell it, heard out with admiration: he was not long after conueyed to the towne, where he receiued his former health, and was liuing in the yeere 1622.</P>

<HEAD>The Gouernment of Captaine <HI>Daniel Tuckar.</HI></HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1616"/> ABout the mistd of May arriued this Gouernor,<NOTE PLACE="marg"> Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> Treasurer.</NOTE> where finding the Inhabi∣tants both abhorring all exacted labour, as also in a manner disdaining and grudging much to be commanded by him; it could not but passio∣nate any man liuing. But at last according to the <HI>Virginia</HI> order, hee set euery one was with him at Saint <HI>Georges,</HI> to his taske, to cleere grounds, fell trees, set corne, square timber, plant vines and other fruits brought out of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> These by their taske Masters by breake a day repaired to the wharfe, from thence to be imployed to the place of their imployment, till nine of the clocke, and then in the after-noone from three till Sunne-set. Beside meat, drinke and cloaths, they had for a time a certaine kinde of brasse money with a hogge on the one side, in memory of the abundance of hogges was found at their first landing.</P>
<P>This course thus squared, imitating diuers orders vsed in <HI>Virginia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Tuckars</HI> proceedings.</NOTE> by Sir <HI>Tho. Dale</HI>: he began by them to looke into his instructions giuen by the Company. Whereupon by one M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Richard Norwood</HI> a Suruayor, sent ouer for that purpose, in the time of Master <HI>Moore,</HI> hee began to lay out the eight tribes in the maine, which were to consist of fifty shares to a tribe; and twenty fiue acers to euery share. He also began to plant some Colony men, on some of the especiall shares. He swore also certaine of the chiefe men of euery tribe to bee Bailiffes thereof; and appointed as many men as hee was able for all supplied shares. The goods landed in the store houses hee sent from thence, and dispersed it to his worke∣men in generall: some Boats also began to be builded; but the pinace called the <HI>Thomas</HI> suspected might make an escape, was laid vp in a docke, were shee yet remaineth.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the second moneth of his gouernment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Barke sent to the West Indies.</NOTE> he directed war∣rants to all the Bailiffes, for the holding of a generall Assise at Saint <HI>Georges,</HI> and appointed Master <HI>Stokes</HI> Lieutenant of the Kings Castle at the Gurnets head. The <HI>Edwin</HI> came with him he sent to the West Indies by directions from <HI>England,</HI> to trade with the natiues, for cattell, corne, plants, and other commodities. A course of great importance, which had it been pursued, would certainly haue produced more hopefull effects for the good of the Colony, then all the supplies and <HI>Ma∣gazines</HI> from <HI>England</HI> hath or will in a long time.</P>
<P>Presently after her departure began the Assises, executed by his Deputy. The chiefe matter handled was the hanging one <HI>Iohn Wood</HI> a French man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assises.</NOTE> for spea∣king many distastefull and mutinous speeches against the Gouernour, to shew the rest by that example, the power of his authority, which after with his owne hands he so oft executed with a bastinado amongst the poorer sort; many tearmed it a cruelty, not much lesse then tyranny: but the sequell is more then strange.</P>
<P>So it was that fiue of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The strange ad∣uenture of fiue men in a boat.</NOTE> seeing by no meanes they could get passage for <HI>England,</HI> resolued to vndergoe all hazards but they would make an escape from such seruitude. The chiefe mariner and plotter of this businesse, was <HI>Richard San∣ders</HI> and his confederates, <HI>William Goodwin</HI> a ship Carpenter, <HI>Thomas Harison</HI> a Ioyner, <HI>Iames Barker</HI> a Gentleman, and <HI>Henry Puet.</HI> These repairing to the Go∣uernour, and with pleasing insinuations told him, if hee would allow them but
<PB N="184" REF="103"/>
things necessary, they would build him a boat of two or three tunnes, with a close decke, should goe a fishing all weathers. The Gouernour halfe proud that hee had brought his men to so good a passe, as he conceiued, to offer themselues to so necessary a worke; instantly with all willingnesse furnished them with all things they could desire, and many faire promises to incourage them to performe it with all expedition. Hauing made choise of a place most fit from molestation, they went forward with that expedition, that in a short time shee was brought to perfection. By this time, the ship that brought the Gouernour, being ready to depart, hee sends a lusty gange to goe fetch his new boat to carry him aboard, but arriuing at the place where she was built, they could heare no more of her, but she was gone the last euening to Sea, to try how shee would saile. Much search and dispute was where this boat should be: but at last they found diuers letters in the cabbins, to this effect, directed to the Gouernour, and other their friends: that their hard and bad vsage was so intolerable, and their hope so small euer againe to see their Countrey, or be deliuered from such seruitude, they did rather chuse to put themselues to that desperate hazard to goe for <HI>England,</HI> in which if they mis∣caried, as it was much to be mistrusted, their liues and bloods should be required at their hands was the cause. A compasse Diall <HI>Barker</HI> had borrowed of Master <HI>Hues,</HI> to whom he writ that as hee had oft perswaded them to patience, and that God would pay them though none did: hee must now bee contented with the losse of his Diall, with his owne doctrine. Such leasure they found to bee merry when in the eye of reason they were marching into a most certaine ruine. The Gouernour being thus satisfied of their escape, extreamly threatned them no lesse then a hanging, but the stormes of the Ocean they now more feared then him; good prouision by bartering they had got from the ship, where <HI>Goodwin</HI> in a brauado told the Mariners, though he could not be permitted to goe with them, yet peraduenture hee might be in <HI>England</HI> before them, whereat the Master and his Mate laughed merrily. But hauing beene now vnder saile three weekes, the winds so fauoured them, they felt nothing of what they had cause to feare: then a blustering gale blowing in their teeth, put them to much extremity for diuers dayes, then becomming more gentle away they past prosperously some eight or ten dayes more, till meeting a French Piccaroune of whom they desired succour, hee like himselfe tooke from them what hee liked, leauing them not so much as a crosse-staffe to obserue withall, and so cast them off: their course still they con∣tinued till their victuall began to fall to the lowest ebbe; and the very knees of their small vessell were halfe hewed away for fire wood. At last to their infinit ioy they arriued in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where the Earle of <HI>Tomund</HI> honorably entertained them, and caused the boat to be hung vp for a Monument, and well she might, for shee had sailed more then 3300. miles by a right line thorow the maine Sea, without any sight of land, and I thinke since God made the world, the like nauigation was neuer done, nor heard of. This fortunate <HI>Sanders</HI> going to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> in the rifling some ships there tooke, it was his chance to buy an old chest, for three or foure shillings, but because it wanted a key hee repented his bargaine, and would gladly haue sold it againe for lesse. A certaine time it lay tossed to and fro as a thing hee little regarded, but at last hauing little to doe, hee broke it open, where he found a thousand pounds starling, or so much gold as bought him in <HI>England</HI> a good estate, which leauing with his wife he returned againe to the <HI>East Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>George</HI> setting saile three dayes after this escape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants from the West Indies.</NOTE> the Gouernour seazed and confiscated all that those fugitiues left behinde them. Within a weeke after returned the <HI>Edwin</HI> from the <HI>West Indies,</HI> furnished with figges, pynes, sugar∣canes, plantaines, papanes and diuers other plants, which were presently replan∣ted, and since increased into greater numbers, also an <HI>Indian</HI> and a <HI>Negar,</HI> and so much <HI>ligna vitae</HI> as defrayed all the charge. The Gouernor thus busied amongst his plants, making hedges of Figtrees, and Pomgranets, and seuerall diuisions by
<PB N="185" REF="103"/>
Palizadoes for the defence of their guarding and keeping their cattell, for in such husbandry qualities he well deserued great commendations. The Aduenturers to supply him sent with all speed they could the <HI>Hopewell,</HI> a small Barke, but an excellent sailer, and in her one Captaine <HI>Powell</HI> an excellent Mariner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The exploits of Captain <HI>Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll.</HI></NOTE> and well ac∣quainted in the Indies where he was to goe trade, after he had landed his passen∣gers in the Summer Iles: but in his iourney at the Westerne Iles meeting a <HI>Bra∣sile</HI> man, hee liked the suger and passengers so well, hee mand the Caruill with his owne men, and continued his course, but bethinking himself how this would be entertained at the Summer Iles, hee found such doubts, hee went directly for the West Indies to take time to resolue what to doe: arriuing there hee met a French rouer, one euery way as cunning as himselfe, but much more trecherous. A great league of kindnesse is soone made betweene them, vpon confidence whereof, <HI>Powell</HI> and some of the chiefe with him being inuited aboord him, is easily entised, and in the midst of their cups both hee and his company treache∣rously made prisoners; and thus was forced to giue him their prise, or hang at the yards arme with all his company. Hauing set them a shore, away goes the French man; <HI>Powels</HI> ship being but hard by, presently fetcht them all a boord, but finding his victuall neere spent, and no hope at all to recouer his prize, set his Portugales on shore, and set saile for the Summer Iles; where safely arriuing, hee declared the whole passage to the Gouernour, lest some other in telling might make it worse, of which the Gouernour seemed well enough to approue.</P>
<P>This Gouernour still spent his time in good husbandry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Assise.</NOTE> although some of the snarling sort here in <HI>England,</HI> whom nothing will please, writ to him hee was fit∣ter to be a Gardiner then a Gouernour: some time he spent in digging of a great pond, but that worke proued altogether vnprofitable: about that time was held the second Assise. The greatest matter passed, was a Proclamatiō against the spoile of Cahowes, but it came too late, for they were most destroyed before: a platforme hee caused to be erected by <HI>Pagits</HI> Fort, where a good Fort were very necessary. Captaine <HI>Powell</HI> not hauing performed his seruice in the West Indies, he conditi∣oned with the Company, is sent thither againe by this Gouernour, and thirteene or fourteene of his best men, furnished with all things necessary. In the meane time the Company vnderstanding, that in Ianuary, February and March, there are many Whales, for which fishing they sent the Neptune, a tall ship well pro∣uided with euery thing fitting for that purpose. But before she arriued, Captaine <HI>Tuckar,</HI> who had brought also with him most prouisions for that imploiment, sent three good Shalops to try what could be done, but whether it was the swiftnes of the Whale in swimming, or the condition of the place, certaine it is for all their la∣bour and hazard, they could kill none, though they strucke many.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1617"/> To begin his second yeere, he called the third Assise,<NOTE PLACE="marg"> The third Assise. Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> Treasurer.</NOTE> where diuers were punished as their faults deserued: three were condemned to die; two were repriued, but the third was hanged: the next day there was also a leuy for the repairing two Forts; but that labour tooke not such effect as was intended, for want of good directions.</P>
<P>But the great God of heauen being angry at somewhat happened in those pro∣ceedings, caused such an increase of silly rats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The countrey neere deuoured with rats.</NOTE> in the space of two yeeres so to a∣bound, before they regarded them, that they filled not onely those places where they were first landed, but swimming from place to place, spread themselues in∣to all parts of the Countrey, insomuch that there was no Iland but it was peste∣red with them; and some fishes haue beene taken with rats in their bellies, which they caught in swimming from Ile to Ile: their nests they had almost in euery tree, and in most places their burrowes in the ground like conies: they spared not the fruits of the plants, or trees, nor the very plants themselues, but are them vp. When they had set their corne, the rats would come by troupes in the night and scratch it out of the ground. If by diligent watch any escaped till it came to earing, it should then very hardly escape them: and they became noysome euen to the very persons of men. They vsed all the diligence they could for the destroying of
<PB N="186" REF="104"/>
them, nourishing cats both wilde and tame, for that purpose; they vsed rats∣bane, and many times set fire on the woods, that oft ran halfe a mile before it was extinct; euery man was enioyned to set twelue traps, and some of their owne ac∣cord haue set neere an hundred, which they euer visited twice or thrice in a night; they also trained vp their dogges to hunt them, wherein they became so expert, that a good dog in two or three houres would kil forty or fity. Many other deuices they vsed to destroy them, but could not preuaile, finding them still increasing against them: nay they so deuoured the fruits of the earth, that they were destitute of bread for a yeere or two; so that when they had it afterwards, they were so wained from it, they easily neglected to eat it with their meat. Besides they endeuoured so much for the planting Tobacco for present gaine, that they neg∣lected many things might more haue preuailed for their good, which caused a∣mongst them much weaknesse and mortality, since the beginning of this vermine.</P>
<P>At last it pleased God, but by what meanes it is not well knowne, to take them away;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange confu∣sion of rats.</NOTE> in so much that the wilde cats and many dogs which liued on them, were famished, and many of them leauing the woods, came downe to their houses, and to such places where they vse to garbish their fish, and became tame. Some haue at∣tributed the destruction of them the to encrease of wild cats, but that is not likely they should be so suddenly encreased rather at that time, then foure yeeres before; and the chiefe occasion of this supposition was, because they saw some companies of them leaue the woods, and slew themselues for want of food. Others by the coldnesse of winter, which notwithstanding is neuer so great there, as with vs in March, except it be in the wind: besides the rats wanted not the fethers of young birds and chickins, which they daily killed, and Palmeta mosse to build them∣selues warme nests out of the wind, as vsually they did; neither doth it appeare that the cold was so mortall to them, seeing they would ordinarily swimme from place to place, and bee very fat euen in the midst of winter. It remaineth then, that as God doth sometimes effect his will without subordinate and secondary causes, so wee need not doubt, but that in the speedy encrease of this vermine; as also by the preseruation of so many of them by such weake meanes as they then enioyed, and especially in the so sudden remouall of this great annoyance, there was ioyned with and besides the ordinary and manifest meanes, a more mediate and secret worke of God.</P>
<P>About this time <HI>Henry Long,</HI> with seuen others in an extreame storme were cast away, but three of them escaped. One of them being asked what hee thought in the worst of that extremity, answered, he thought nothing but gallowes claime thy right, and it seemes God well heard his prayer, and rewarded his ingratitude; for he was hanged within halfe a yeere after. In that March also fiue men went to Sea, but as yet was neuer heard of, and three more drowned in a boat. By <HI>Hilli∣ards</HI> house grew a very faire Cedar, which by a thunder clap was rent almost to small shiuers, and a man stood by him, and <HI>Samuel Tanton,</HI> most fearfully blasted, yet neither they, the house, not a little childe, yet a paire of racks in the house was all torne to fitters. The <HI>Neptune</HI> not long after arriuing to fish for whale, her for∣tune proued no better then the Gouernours, yet some are of opinion, profit might be made by them.</P>
<P>In May they discried foure saile, so that manning all their Forts, they stood two daies in Armes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The returne of M. <HI>Powel</HI> from the Indies.</NOTE> expecting what they were; at last they found it Master <HI>Powell</HI> returned from the West-Indies in the <HI>Hopewell,</HI> where missing such trade as he expected, these three Frigots comming in his way, he could not chuse but take them; Meale, Hides and Munition was their lading: Faire weather the Gouernor made with <HI>Powell,</HI> till he had got all the goods into his owne possession, and then called <HI>Powell</HI> to a strict account for doing such an vnwarrantable act; much a doe then was betwixt the taker and receiuer; but <HI>Powell</HI> was glad to be excused to answer it in <HI>England,</HI> leauing all hee had taken behinde him in the Iles: The <HI>Neptune</HI> also returned with him, but noble <HI>Powell</HI> lost all his pay and pillage for
<PB N="187" REF="104"/>
this yeeres worke. For which the Company sent for to <HI>Tuckar,</HI> so that he also lost his part as well as <HI>Powell</HI>: Notwithstanding, the Gouernour by this meanes be∣ing strong in shipping▪ fitted the Caruill with twelue men, vnder the command of <HI>Edward Waters</HI> formerly spoken of, and sent them to <HI>Ʋirginia</HI> about such bu∣sinesse as hee had conceiued. Arriuing there, they obtained some goates, and and hogs, &amp; what they could spare, and so returned for the <HI>Summer Iles</HI>; but whe∣ther they could not finde the Iles for want of skill, or beaten off by ill weather, or the ill will they bare the Gouernor, it matters not much: But they bare vp again for <HI>Virginia,</HI> where they all remained, and would returne no more to <HI>Summer Iles.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour thinking to make some vse of the hides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A supposed muti∣ny by M. <HI>Pollard,</HI> and M. <HI>Rich.</HI></NOTE> set some that profes∣sed themselues Tanners, to make tryall of their skill; but they lost their labours and spoiled the hides.

Yet <HI>Gabriel</HI> for example sake was condemned to bee hanged, and was vpon the ladder, but reprieued.

The rest was to be diuided into eight parts, each part to be called a tribe, and to haue his denomination of some principall person that was Aduenturer therein: and accordingly the first Tribe to bee Eastward, was then called <HI>Bedfords</HI> Tribe, now <HI>Hamiltons</HI>: the second, <HI>Smiths</HI>: Tribe the third, <HI>Cavendish,</HI> now <HI>Deuonshires</HI>: the fourth, <HI>Pembrooks</HI>: the fift, <HI>Pagits</HI>: the sixt, <HI>Man∣sils,</HI> now <HI>Warwicks</HI>: the seuenth, <HI>Southhampton</HI>: the eighth, <HI>Sands</HI>: in the honours of the Right honorable the Marquis <HI>Hamilton,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Deuonshire,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Pembrooke,</HI> the <HI>Lord Pagit,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Warwicke,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Southhampton,</HI> and Sir <HI>Edwin Sands.</HI> Againe each of those Tribes were to bee diuided into fifty parts, called shares; and euery Aduenturer to haue his shares in these tribes as was determined, by casting lots in <HI>England,</HI> the manner of it appeares by the <HI>Map,</HI> and more largely by his Booke of the Suruay of the Countrey, which is in the Records of the Colony.

<P>Touching the common ground in each Tribe, as also the ouer-plus, you may finde that at large in the Booke of Surueyes amongst their Records.</P>
<P>Now though the Countrey was small, yet they could not conueniently haue beene disposed and well setled, without a true description and a suruey of it; and againe, euery man being setled where he might constantly abide, they knew their businesse, and fitted their houshold accordingly: then they built no more Cab∣bens, but substantiall houses, they cleered their grounds, and planted not onely such things as would yeeld them their fruits in a few moneths, but also such as would affoord them profit within a few yeares, so that in a short time the Coun∣trey began to aspire, and neerely approach vnto that happinesse and prosperitie, wherein now it flourisheth, &amp;c.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1618"/> But to follow the History; vpon the best plot of ground could be found,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Maga∣zin.</NOTE> the Gouernor preuailed so much with the generalitie, they built a faire house of Ce∣dar, which being done, he appropriated it to himselfe, which occasioned excee∣ding much distaste. About this time arriued the <HI>Diana</HI> with a good supply of men and prouision, and the first Magazin euer seene in those Iles; which course is not so much commended here, as cursed and abhorred by reason of enhanse∣ments of all the Inhabitants there; six or seuen weeks this ship staied, then hauing towards her fraught thirtie thousand weight of Tobacco; which prouing good, and comming to a lucky Market, gaue great encouragement to the Aduenturers to goe lustily forward in their Plantation, and without such successe, there is no∣thing but grudging and repining. But about the appropriation of this new built house, many bad discontents grew betwixt the oppressed Colony and the Gouer∣nor, especially betwixt him and the Minister, and <HI>Lewes,</HI> who would neither be feared with threats nor imprisonment, that their malice continued till they met in <HI>England,</HI> of which the Minister made the cause so plaiue, hee very well and ho∣nestly it seemes, discharged himselfe.</P>
<P>Now in those times of these endlesse vnciuill broiles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two exploits of desperate Fugi∣tiues.</NOTE> two desperate men and a proper Gentlewoman got into a Boat, and thinking to make an escape to <HI>Ʋirgi∣nia,</HI> as appeared by some Letters they left behinde them were neuer more heard on. The very next moneth after the like was attempted by six others, so desirous they were to be rid of their seruitude; but their plot being discouered by one of their societie, they were apprehended, arraigned, and condemned to be hanged: the next day being led with halters about their neckes to the place of execution, one was hanged, and the rest repriued.</P>
<P>The <HI>Diana</HI> arriuing well in <HI>England,</HI> for all the infinite numbers of complaints,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The arriuall of the <HI>Blessing.</HI></NOTE> the Tobacco did helpe to sweeten all manner of grieuances, yet it bred a distaste in the opinions of so many, they began to thinke of another Gouernor; but for that time it was so qualified by diuers of his friends, they dispatched away the <HI>Blessing,</HI> which arriued in the <HI>Somer Iles.</HI> Though their generall Letter was faire and courteous to the Gouernor, yet by the report of the Passengers and diuers particular letters from his friends, it was assured him his cruelty and couetousnesse, for all his paines and industry was much disliked, nor was he like to enioy his
<PB N="190" REF="106"/>
house, and that land he had planted for himselfe, by the extreme oppression of the Comminalty. This caused so many ielousies to arise in his conceit, that at last he fully resolued to returne by this ship, that no sooner set saile from <HI>England,</HI> then they proceeded to the nomination of a new Gouernor. Many were presented according to the affections of those that were to giue in their voices, but it chiefe∣ly rested betwixt one Captaine <HI>Southwell,</HI> and one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Nathaniel Butler,</HI> where wee will leaue them a while to the consideration of the Court and Company. Now Captaine <HI>Tuckar</HI> hauing instituted Captaine <HI>Kendall</HI> one of the six Gouer∣nors before spoken of for his substitute, returned with this ship directly for <HI>England,</HI> as well to excuse himselfe of those obiections he suspected, as to get as∣sured him the house and land he had alotted for himselfe, lest it might otherwise be disposed of in his absence.</P>

<HEAD>The Gouernment of Captaine <HI>Miles Kendall,</HI> Deputy for Captaine <HI>Tuckar.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The arriuall of two ships.</NOTE>THE vnexpected returne of Captaine <HI>Tuckar,</HI> caused a demurre in the election of the new Gouernor; some perswading these oft changes were so troublesome, dangerous, and chargeable, it were best to continue Captaine <HI>Kendall</HI>; others againe stood for Captaine <HI>Tuckar,</HI> but during the time of these opinions, the <HI>Gilliflower</HI> was dispatched with a supply. Now I should haue remembred, <HI>Tuckar</HI> was no sooner out of the harbour, but he met Master <HI>Elfred</HI> in a ship called the <HI>Treasurer,</HI> sent from <HI>Ʋirginia</HI> to trade: by her he writ to his Deputy Master <HI>Kendall,</HI> to haue a care of all things, and beware of too much acquaintance with this ship, which hee suspected was bound for the West-Indies. Notwithstanding, <HI>Elfred</HI> receiued what kindnesse the Ile could af∣ford; he promised to reuisit them at his returne; this done, because they would not be gouernlesse when his Deputiship was expired, there was a generall assem∣bly, and by that Election <HI>Kendall</HI> was confirmed to succeed still Gouernor. Now they began to apply themselues to the finishing some plat-forme about <HI>Smiths</HI> Fort, and laying the foundation of a Church to be built of Cedar, till the <HI>Gilly∣flower</HI> arriued with some priuate letters to <HI>Kendall,</HI> how he was elected Gouernor of those Iles for three yeeres. During her stay they held their Assises, where for some few suspected facts three were condemned, and the better to terrifie the rest, led to the place of execution, but reprieued; diuers of the rest had their faults par∣doned, and the <HI>Gilliflower</HI> set saile for <HI>New found land.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Butler</HI> chosen Gouer∣nor.</NOTE>The loue and kindnesse, honesty and industry of this Captaine <HI>Kendall,</HI> hath beene very much commended; by others, somewhat disliked: but an Angell in those imploiments cannot please all men, yet this consideration bred much ill bloud as well here as there, so that the Company directly concluded, Captaine <HI>Butler</HI> should with what expedition they could, goe to be their Gouernor: In the <HI>Interim</HI> they tooke the opportunitie of a ship, called the <HI>Sea-flower,</HI> bound for <HI>Virginia,</HI> and by her sent a Preacher and his Family, with diuers Passengers, and newes of a new Gouernor. This bred a great distaste amongst many, that still they should haue new officers and strangers for their Gouernors they neuer heard of, and themselues still kept there whether they would or no, without any prefer∣ment, no nor scarce any of them their inhabiting, to haue any land at all of their owne, but liue all as tenants, or as other mens poore seruants.</P>
<P>About this time came in Captaine <HI>Kerby</HI> with a small Barke from the West-Indies, who hauing refreshed himselfe, was very kindly vsed by the Gouernor
<PB N="191" REF="106"/>
and so departed. Not long after a Dutch Frigot was cast away vpon the Westerne shore, yet by the helpe of the English they saued the men, though the ship peri∣shed amongst the Rocks. A little after one Ensigne <HI>Wood</HI> being about the loading of a peece, by thrusting a pike into the concauitie, grating vpon the shot, or some∣what about the powder, strucke fire within her and so discharged, but wounded him cruelly and blew him into the Sea, though hee was got out by some that stood by him, yet hee died of those wounds. Within two or three daies after, Captaine <HI>Elfred</HI> now comes in a second time: but of that we shall say more in the gouernment of Captaine <HI>Butler,</HI> who presently after arriued with a good supply, and was kindly entertained by Captaine <HI>Kendall</HI> and all the Colony.</P>

<P>CAptaine <HI>Butler</HI> being arriued the twentieth of October,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A plat-forme burnt, and much hurt by a <HI>Heri∣cano.</HI> 1619.</NOTE> 1619. some mutterings there was how to maintaine their election of Captaine <HI>Ken∣dall,</HI> but better remembring themselues, that conceit quickly dissolued. The next day, <HI>Kendall,</HI> the Ministers, and the Counsell went aboord to salute the new Gouernor, where after they had dined with the best entertainment he could giue them; they saw the Redout belonging to the Kings Castle by a mischance on fire, whither he repaired with all the meanes he could to quench it; but all the platforme and cariages were consumed before their faces, and they could not helpe it. Two daies after he went vp to the Towne, had his Commissi∣on publikely read, made a short speech to the Company, and so tooke vpon him the gouernment. Then presently he began to repaire the most necessary defects: The next moneth came in the <HI>Garland,</HI> sent from <HI>England</HI> six or seuen weekes be∣fore him; so that being seuenteene weeks in her voyage, it was so tedious and grieuous to diuers of the Fresh-water Passengers, that such a sicknesse bred a∣mongst them, many died as well Sailers as Passengers. Hauing taken the best or∣der he could for their releefe, passed through all the Tribes, and held his first As∣sise in Captaine <HI>Tuckars</HI> house at the ouer-plus. Towards the last of this moneth of Nouemb. there arose a most terrible storme or <HI>Hericano,</HI> that blew vp many great trees by the roots: the <HI>Warwick</HI> that brought the Gouernor was cast away, but the <HI>Garland</HI> rid by her, saued her selfe by cutting downe her Masts; and not long after a second storme, no lesse violent then the first, wherein the Mount which was a frame of wood built by Master <HI>More</HI> for a Watch-tower to looke out to Sea, was blowne vp by the roots, and all that Winter crop of corne blasted: And thus was the new Gouernor welcomed.</P>
<P>With the beginning of the new yeere he began his first peece of fortification,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The refortifying the Kings Castle.</NOTE> vpon a Rocke which flankers the Kings Castle, and finding the ship called the <HI>Treasurer</HI> starke rotten and vnseruiceable, hee tooke nine peeces of Ordinance from her to serue other vses. The <HI>Garland</HI> for want of meanes, could not make her voiage to <HI>Ʋirginia</HI> as she was appointed; wherefore he entertained her to re∣turne to <HI>England,</HI> with all the Tabacco they had in the Ile. It was Ianuary before she departed, in which time shee failed not much to haue beene twice cast away. But those strange and vnauoidable mischances, rather seemed to quicken the Gouernors industry then to dull it. Hauing finished the Church begun by Cap∣taine <HI>Kendall,</HI> with an infinite toile and labour he got three peeces out of the wracke <HI>VVarwicke.</HI> Hauing an excellent Dutch Carpinter he entertained of them that were cast away in the Dutch Frigot; he imploied him in building of Boats, whereof they were in exceeding great want. In February they discouered a tall ship beating too and againe, as it seemed by her working, being ignorant of the Coast; some thought her a <HI>Spaniard</HI> to view their Forts, which stand most to
<PB N="192" REF="107"/>
that part she so neerely approached; some, English; but the most, some Dutch man of Warre: The wind blew to high, they durst not send out a Boat, though they much doubted she would be foule of their Rocks, but at last she bore vp rommy for the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amber-greece found.</NOTE> and we heard of her no more. That euening, a lucky fellow it should seeme he was, that found a peece of Amber-greece of eight ounces, as he had twice before, which bringing to the Gouernor, he had ready money for the one halfe, after three pound an ounce, according to their order of Court, to encourage others to looke out for more, and preuent the mischiefe insueth by concealing of it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The arriuall of two Dutch Fri∣gots.</NOTE>Within a few daies after, they descried two Frigots that came close to the shore, and sent a Letter to the Gouernor, writ in <HI>Italian,</HI> that they were <HI>Hollanders</HI> had beene in the West-Indies, and desired but to arriue, refresh themselues with wood and water, and so be gone. The Gouernor forthwith sent them to vnder∣stand, that being there vnder his Maiestie of <HI>England</HI> to command those Iles, he was to carrie himselfe a friend to his friends, and an enemy to his enemies; if therefore he could shew a lawfull Commission for his being honestly and nobly emploied, he and his should be kindly welcome, otherwise they were to aduen∣ture at their perills. But his Commission was so good, he staied there two mo∣neths, and was so well fitted with Oile &amp; Bacon, they were all glad and happy of this Dutch Captaine <HI>Scoutans</HI> arriuall, with many thanks to their old friend Cap∣taine <HI>Powell</HI> that had conducted him thither: the Colony being exceedingly in great want and distresse, bought the most part of it at reasonable rates, so Cap∣taine <HI>Scoutan</HI> returned to the West-Indies, and Captaine <HI>Powell</HI> for his part in the Low-Countries. Whilest these things were in action, the Aduenturers in \
<HI>England</HI> made many a long looke for their ships; at last the <HI>Garland</HI> brought them all the newes, but the Tobacco was so spoiled either in the leaking ship, or the making vp, it caused a great suspicion there could none was good come from those Iles; where (were they but perfit in the cure) questionlesse it would be much better then a great quantitie of that they sell for <HI>Verinas,</HI> and many a thousand of it in <HI>London</HI> hath beene bought and sold by that title.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The differences betwixt the Mi∣nisters.</NOTE>The Gouernor being cleere of those distractions, falls vpon the restoring of the burnt Redoubt, where he cuts out a large new plat-forme, and mounts seuen great peece of Ordnance vpon new cariages of Cedar. Now amongst all those troubles, it was not the least to bring the two Ministers to subscribe to the Booke of Common Praier, which all the Bishops in <HI>England</HI> could not doe. Finding it high time to attempt some conformitie, bethought himselfe of the Liturgie of <HI>Garnsey</HI> and <HI>Iarse,</HI> wherein, all those particulars they so much stumbled at, were omitted. No sooner was this propounded, but it was gladly imbraced by them both, whereupon the Gouernor translated it <HI>verbatim</HI> out of French into Eng∣lish, and caused the eldest Minister vpon Easter day to begin the vse thereof at <HI>S.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The rebuilding the Mount.</NOTE>Much about this time, in such a faire morning, that had inuited many Boats farre out to the Sea to fish, did rise such a <HI>Hericano</HI> that much indangered them all, so that one of them with two Boies were driuen to Sea and neuer more heard of. The Ministers thus agreed, a Proclamation was published for keeping of the Sabbath, and all the defectiue cariages he endeuoured to haue renewed, builded a small Boat of Cedar onely to goe with Ores, to be ready vpon any oc∣casion to discouer any shipping, and tooke order euery Fort should haue the like: Also caused numbers of Cedars to be brought from diuers places in flotes, to re∣build the Mount, which with an vnspeakable toile, was raised seuen foot higher then before, and a Falcon mounted at the foot, to be alwaies discharged for a war∣ning to all the Forts vpon the discouery of any shipping, and this he called Rich Mount. This exceeding toile and labour, hauing no Cattle but onely mens

The subordinate Officers to these in euery tribe, are the Consta∣bles, Head-borowes, and Church-wardens; these are the triers of the Tobacco, which if they allow not to be marchantable, is burnt: and these are the executio∣ners of their ciuill and politicke causes.</P>

<P>Concerning their Courts for decision of right and iustice, the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciuill Officers and Courts.</NOTE> though last in constitution, is their generall assembly; allowed by the state in <HI>England,</HI> in the nature of a Parliament, consisting of about forty persons; <HI>viz.</HI> the Gouernour, the Counsell, the Bailiffes of the tribes, and two Burgesses of each tribe chosen by voyces in the tribe, besides such of the Clergie as the Gouernour thinkes most fit, to be held once a yeere, as you shall heare more thereof hereafter. The next Court is the Assise or Iayles of deliuerie, held twice euery yeere, in Christmas, and Whit∣son weeke, for all criminall offenders, and ciuill causes betwixt party and party; as actions of debt, trespasse, battery, slander, and the like: and these are determined by a Iury of twelue men, and aboue them is also a grand Iury to examine matters of greater consequence. The last day of the Assise might also well be held a Court, for hearing the trangressions in matters of contempt, mis-behauiour towards any Magistrate, riots, seditious speakers, contemners of warrants, and such like: there are also as occasion shall require, many matters heard by the Gouernor, or his Of∣ficers, and oft iustice done in seuerall places, but those are but as daies of hearing, and as preparatiues against their Courts, &amp;c.</P>

her Ordnance being lashed so fast they could not be vnloosed, till the ropes and decks were rotten, yet some few buttes of beare being storie they got, which though it had lien six moneths vnder water was very good, notwithstanding the next yeere they recouered fiue peeces of Ordnance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A generall as∣semblie in man∣ner a Parlia∣ment.</NOTE>Vpon the first of August, according to the Companies instructions from <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> began the generall assembly at the towne of Saint <HI>George,</HI> which was the first these Iles euer had; consisting as is said, of the Gouernour, Councell, Bailiffes, and Burgesses, and a Secretarie to whom all bils were presented, and by him o∣penly read in the house, also a Clerke to record the Acts, being thirty two in all; fifteene of which being sent into <HI>England,</HI> were by a generall consent receiued and enacted, the titles whereof are these following: as for all the reasons for them, they would be too tedious to recite.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Acts.</NOTE>The first was against the vniust sale and letting of apprentises and other ser∣uants, and this was especially for the righting the vndertakers in <HI>England.</HI> The second, concerning the disposing of aged, diseased, and impotent persons, for it being considered how carelesse many are in preferring their friends, or sending sometimes any they can procure to goe, such vnseruiceable people should be re∣turned back at their charge that sent them, rather then be burdensome to the poore Inhabitants in the Iles. The third, the necessary manning the Kings Castle, being the key of the Ile, that a garison of twelue able men should bee there alwaies resi∣dent: and 3000. eares of corne, and 1000. pounds of Tobacco payed them by the generality yeerely, as a pension. The fourth, against the making vnmarchan∣table Tobacco, and Officers sworne to make true trials, &amp; burne that was naught. The fist, inioyned the erection of certaine publike bridges, and the maintenance of them. The sixt, for a continuall supply of victuall for all the Forts, to bee pre∣serued, till some great occasion to vse it. The seuenth was, for two fixed dayes e∣uery yeere for the Assises. The eight, commands the making of high-waies, and prohibiting the passage ouer mens grounds and planted fields, as well to preuent the spoyling of gardens, as conueniencie to answer any alarum. The ninth, for the preseruing young tortoises and birds, that were carelesly destroyed. The tenth, prouided against vagabonds, &amp; prohibited the entertainement of other mens ser∣uants. The eleuenth, compelled the setting of a due quantity of corne for euery fa∣mily. The twelfth, the care corne being set, enioyned the keeping vp of their poul∣try till it was past their reaches. The thirteenth, for the preseruation of sufficient fences, &amp; against the selling of marked trees appointed for bounds. The fourteenth, granted to a leuy for a thousand pound weight of Tobacco, towards the payment of publike workes, as the bridges and the mount. The fifteenth, for the enioyning an acknowledgement and acception of all resident Gouernours, and the warran∣ting him to continue, though his time be expired, till the arriuall of a legitimate successor from <HI>England,</HI> to preuent all vomeet and presumptuous elections, be∣sides it was desired by petition in <HI>England,</HI> the new Gouernous should liue two months as a priuate man after his arriuall, if his predecessor did stay so long, the better to learne and obserue his course. And these are the contents of those fif∣teene Acts, applied as you may perceiue: which the lawes of <HI>England</HI> could not take notice of, because euery climate hath somewhat to it selfe in that kinde in par∣ticular; for otherwise as it is conceiued, it had beene a high impudency and pre∣sumption to haue medled with them, or indeed with any such as these lawes, that had with such great iudgement and iustice alwaies prouided for.</P>
<P>No sooner was this businesse ouer, but the <HI>Magazin</HI> ship is discouered, and that night came into the Harbour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The arriuall of the <HI>Magazin</HI> ship.</NOTE> but in a very weake and sickly case, hauing cast ouer board twenty or thirty of her people, and so violent was the infection, that the most part of the failers, as well as passengers, were so sicke, or dismaid, or both, that the Master confessed, had they stayed at the Sea but a weeke longer, they had all perished. There arriued with this ship diuers Gentlemen of good fashion, with their wiues and families; but many of them crasie by the tediousnesse of the voy∣age:
<PB N="195" REF="108"/>
howsoeuer most of them, by the excellent salubrity of the aire, then which the world hath not a better, soone after recouered; yet some there were that died presently after they got ashore, it being certainly the quality of the place, either to kill, or cure quickly, as the bodies are more or lesse corrupted. By this ship the Company sent a supply of ten persons for the generality, but of such bad condi∣tion that it seemed they had picked the Males out of <HI>Newgate,</HI> the Females from <HI>Bridewell</HI>: As the Gouernour found it his best course, to grant out the women to such as were so greedy of wiues, and would needs haue them for better for worse; and the men hee placed in the Kings Castle for souldiers. But this bad, weake, sickly supply being dispersed for their best reliefe, by the much imployment of his boats in remoouing them, many of his owne men became infected, so that for some weekes, they were not able to doe him any seruice at all.
Strict instructions also they brought for the planting of Sugar cane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for which the Iland being roc∣kie and dry, is so vnproper, that few as yet haue beene seene to prosper: yet there are others hold the contrary opinion, that there is raine so ordinarily, the Iles are so moist, as produceth all their plants in such infinit abundance: there is no great reason to suspect this, were it rightly vsed, more then the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st.<NOTE PLACE="marg">70000. weight of Tobacco.</NOTE> Seuenty thousand weight of Tobacco being prepared towards her fraught, she returned for <HI>England.</HI> No sooner was shee gone then came in another, sent by the Company and gene∣ralty, well conditioned, but shee failed not much to haue beene cast away amongst those dangerous &amp; terrible rocks; by her came also expresse command, they should entertaine no other ships, then were directly sent from the Company: this caused much grudging, and indeed a generall distraction and exclamation among the Inhabitants, to be thus constrained to buy what they wanted, and sell what they had at what price the <HI>Magazin</HI> pleased, and to debarre true men from comming to them for trade or reliefe, that were daily receiued in all the harbours in <HI>England.</HI> So long this ship stayed going for fraught and wages, the Master not caring how long he lay at that rate in a good harbour, the Gouernour was ready to send her away by Proclamation. Thus ended the first yeere of the gouernment of C. <HI>Butler.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1620"/> With the first of the second yeere were held the Assises, where all the Bailiffes were fined for not giuing a beginning to the building of the bridges;<NOTE PLACE="marg"> The building of three bridges and other works.</NOTE> there was also an order to restraine the excessiue wages all handicrafts men would haue: and that the Church-wardens should meet twice a yeere, to haue all their presentments made perfect against the Assises. The Assises done, all the ablest men were trained in their armes, and then departed to their owne homes. The towne thus cleered, he made certaine new carriages for some demy Culuerings, and a large new store-house of Cedar for the yeerely <HI>Magazines</HI> goods; finished <HI>Warwicks</HI> Fort begun by Master <HI>More,</HI> and made a new platforme at <HI>Pagits</HI> Fort, also a faire house of lime and stone for the Townes-house. The three bridges appointed by the gene∣rall assembly, was followed with such diligence, though they were more then an hundred, or an hundred and twenty foot in length, hauing the foundation and arches in the Sea, were raised and accomplished, so that man or beast with facility might passe them.</P>
<P>At Whitsonday was held the fourth generall Assise at Saint <HI>Georges,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The generall Assises, and the proceedings.</NOTE> where were tryed twenty seuerall causes; foure or fiue were whipped or burnt in the hand, for breaking of houses: also an order was made, that the party cast in the tri∣all of any cause, should pay to euery of the Iurours foure pence: moreouer, that not past ten leaues at the most should grow vpon a plant of Tobacco, and that also in the making it vp, a distinction should diligently be obserued of two kinds, a better and a worse: then they built a strong stone house for the Captaine of the Kings Castle and <HI>corps du guard</HI>; and repaired what defects they could finde in the platformes and carriages.</P>
<P>Captaine <HI>Powell</HI> so oft mentioned, hauing beene in the West-Indies for the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> came to an anchor within shot of their Ordnance, desiring ad∣mittance for wood and water, of which hee had great need, but the Gouernor

would not permit him, so he weighed and departed, whereat the company were so madded, it was not possible to constraine them to cease their exclaimations a∣gainst the Companies inhihition, till they were weary with exclaming: But still for their better defence, not thinking themselues sufficiently secure, hauing fini∣shed two new plat-formes more, arriued the Magazin ship, but her Master was dead, and many of the Passengers, the rest for most part very sicke; and withall, a strange and wonderfull report of much complaint made against the Gouernor to the Company in <HI>England,</HI> by some of them returned in the last yeeres shipping: but it was eight daies before she could get in by reason of ill weather, being for∣ced againe to Sea; so that time, they kept euery night continually great fires, she might see the Ile as well by night as day; but at last she arriued, and he plainly vnderstood, he had more cause a great deale to looke for misconstruction of all his seruice then an acknowledgment, much lesse a recompence any better then his predecessors; but it is no new thing to require the best desert with the most vildest of ingratitude.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange deliue∣rance of a Spa∣nish wracke.</NOTE>The very next daies night after the arriuall of the Magazins ship, newes was brought the Gouernor by a dismaied Messenger from <HI>Sands</HI> his Tribe, that one hundred <HI>Spaniards</HI> were landed in that part, and diuers ships discouered at Sea, whereupon he presently manned the Forts, and instantly made thitherward in person with twentie men, determining as he found cause to draw together more strength by the way. Being got thither by the breake of the next day, in stead of an enemy which he expected, he met onely with a company of poore distressed <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who in their passage from <HI>Carthagena</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> in consort with the Spanish fleet of Plait; by the same storme that had indange∣red the Magazin ship, lost theirs vpon those terrible Rocks, being to the number of seuenty persons, were strangely preserued; and the manner was thus.</P>
<P>About Sunne-set their ship beating amongst the Rocks, some twenty of the Sailers got into the Boat with what treasure they could, leauing the Captaine, the Master, and all the rest to the mercy of the Sea. But a Boy not past foureteene yeares of age that leaped after to haue got into the Boat, missing that hope, it pleased God he got vpon a Chest a drift by him, whereon they report he conti∣nued two daies, and was driuen neere to the cleane contrary part of the Ile, where he was taken vp neere dead, yet well recouered. All this night the ship sticking fast, the poore distressed in her the next day spying land, made a raft, and were those gaue the alarum first a shore about three of the clocke in the after noone. The morning after, about seuen of the clocke came in the Boat to a place called <HI>Mangroue Bay</HI>; and the same day their Carpenter was driuen a shore vp∣on a Planke neere <HI>Hog-Bay.</HI> There was a Gentlewoman that had stood wet vp to the middle vpon the raft from the ship to the shore, being big with childe; and although this was vpon the thirteenth of September, she tooke no hurt, and was safely deliuered of a Boy within three daies after. The best comfort could be giuen them in those extremities they had, although some of the baser sort had beene rifling some of them before the Gouernors arriuall: Also the Spa∣nish Captaine and the chiefe with him, much complained of the treachery of his men to leaue him in that manner, yet had conueyed with them the most of the money they could come by, which he easily missed; whereupon hee suddenly caused all them he accused, to be searched, and recouered to the value of one hun∣dred and fortie pounds starling, which he deliuered into the Captaines hands, to be imploied in a generall purse towards their generall charge: during their stay in the Iles, some of the better sort, nine or ten weeks dieted at his owne table, the rest were billited amongst the Inhabitants at foure shillings the weeke, till they found shipping for their passage, for which they paied no more then the English paied themselues; and for the passage of diuers of them, the Gouernor was glad to stand bound to the Master; some others that were not able to procure such friendship, were so constrained to stay in the Iles, till by their labours they had got

so much as would transport them; and thus they were preserued, releeued, and deliuered.</P>
<P>In the moneth insuing arriued the second ship, and she also had lost her Master,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they solem∣nized the powder treason, and the arriuall of two ships.</NOTE> and diuers of her Passengers; in her came two <HI>Ʋirginian</HI> Women to be married to some would haue them, that after they were conuerted and had children, they might be sent to their Countrey and kindred to ciuilize them. Towards the end of this moneth came in the third ship with a small Magazin, hauing sold what she could, caried the rest to <HI>Ʋirginia,</HI> and neuer did any of those Passengers com∣plaine either of their good diet, or too good vsage at sea; but the cleane contrary still occasioned many of those extremities. The fift of Nouember the damnable plot of the powder treason was solemnized, with Praiers, Sermons, and a great Feast, whereto the Gouernor inuited the chiefe of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> where drinking the Kings health, it was honored with a quicke volly of small shot, which was an∣swered from the Forts with the great Ordnance, and then againe concluded with a second volley of small shot; neither was the afternoone without musicke and dancing, and at night many huge bone-fires of sweet wood.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> to expresse their thankfulnesse at their departure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spaniards returne, and in danger againe. 1621.</NOTE> made a deed of gift to the Gouernor of whatsoeuer he could recouer of the wracked ship; but the ships as they went out came so dangerously vpon a Rock, that the poore <HI>Spaniards</HI> were so dismaied, swearing this place was ominous vnto them, especially the women, that desired rather to goe a shore and die howsoeuer, than aduenture any further in such a labyrinth of dangers, but at last she got cleere without danger, and well to <HI>England</HI>; the other went to <HI>Virginia,</HI> wherein the Gouernor sent two great Chests filled with all such kinds and sorts of Fruits and Plants as their Ilands had; as Figs, Pomgranats, Oranges, Lemons, Sugar-canes, Plantanes, Po∣tatoes, Papawes, Cassado roots, red Pepper, the Prickell Peare, and the like.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three English Murderers found in the Spanish wracke.</NOTE> The ships thus dispatched, hee goeth into the maine, and so out to sea to the Spanish wracke. He had beene there before presently after her ruine, for neuer had ship a more sudden death, being now split in peeces all vnder water. He found small hope to recouer any thing, saue a Cable and an Anchor, and two good Sacars; but the wind was so high hee was forced to returne, being ten miles from the shore, onely with three Murderers, which were knowne to be the same Captaine <HI>Kendall</HI> had sold to Captaine <HI>Kerby,</HI> whose ship was taken by two men of warre of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> the most of his men slaine or hanged, and he being wounded, died in the woods.

<P>Hauing raised three small Bulwarkes at <HI>Southamptons</HI> Fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Assises, and other passages.</NOTE> with two Cur∣taines, and two Rauilings, which indeed is onely the true absolute peece of for∣tification in the Iles; Christmas being come, and the prefixed day of the Assise; diuers were whipped and burnt in the hand, onely three young boyes for stealing were condemned, and at the very point of hanging repriued. The Gouernour then sent his Lieutenant all ouer the maine to distribute Armes to those were found most fit to vse them, &amp; to giue order for their randezuous, which were han∣ged vp in the Church. About this time it chanced a pretty secret to be discoue∣red to preserue their corne from the fly, or weauell, which did in a manner as much hurt as the rats. For the yeere before hauing made a Proclamation that all Corne should be gathered by a certaine day, because many lazy persons ranne so after the ships to get Beere and <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> for which they will giue any thing they haue, much had beene lost for want of gathering. This yeare hauing a very faire crop, some of the Inhabitants, none of the best husbands, hastily gathered it for feare of the penaltie, threw it in great heaps into their houses vnhusked, and so let it lie foure or fiue moneths, which was thought would haue spoiled it: where the good husbands husked it, and with much labour hung it vp, where the Flies did so blow on it, they increased to so many Weauels, they generally

complained of great losse; but those good fellowes that neuer cared but from hand to mouth, made their boasts, that not a graine of theirs had beene touched nor hurt, there being no better way to preserue it then by letting it lie in its huske, and spare an infinite labour formerly had beene vsed. There were also very lucki∣ly about this time found out diuers places of fresh water, of which many of the Forts were very destitute, and the Church-wardens and Side-men were very busie in correcting the prophaners of the Sabbath, Drunkards, Gamesters, and such like. There came also from <HI>Ʋirginia</HI> a small Barke with many thanks for the pre∣sents sent them; much Aquauitae, Oile, Sacke and Bricks they brought in ex∣change of more Fruits and Plants, Ducks, Turkies and Limestone, of which she had plenty, and so returned. During the aboad of the stay of this ship, the mari∣age of one of the <HI>Virginia</HI> maides was consummated with a husband fit for her, at∣tended with more then one hundred guests, and all the dainties for their dinner could be prouided; they made also another triall to fish for Whales, but it tooke no more effect then the former: this was done by the Master of the <HI>Ʋirginia</HI> ship that professed much skill that way, but hauing fraughted his ship with Lime∣stone, with 20000. weight of Potatoes, and such things as he desired, returned for <HI>Ʋirginia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Sodomy.</NOTE>Aprill and May were spent in building a strong new Prison, and perfecting some of the Fortifications, and by the labour of twenty men in fourteene daies was got from the Spanish wracke foure excellent good Sacres, and mounted them at the Forts. Then began the generall Assize, where not fewer then fifty ciuill, or rather vnciuill actions were handled, and twenty criminall prisoners brought to the bar; such a multitude of such vild people were sent to this Plantation, that he thought himselfe happy his time was so neere expired: three of the foulest acts were these: the first for the rape of a married woman, which was acquitted by a sense∣lesse Iury; the second for buggering a Sow, and the third for Sodomy with a boy, for which they were hanged; during the time of the imprisonment of this Bug∣gerer of the Sow, a Dung-hill Cocke belonging to the same man did continual∣ly haunt a Pigge of his also, and to the wonder of all them that saw it who were many, did so frequently tread the Pigge as if it had beene one of his Hens, that the Pigge languished and died within a while after, and then the Cocke resorted to the very same Sow (that this fellow was accused for) in the very same manner; and as an addition to all this, about the same time two Chickens were hatched, the one whereof had two heads, the other crowed very loud and lustily within twelue houres after it was out of the shell. A desperate fellow being to bee ar∣raigned for stealing a Turky, rather then he would endure his triall, secretly con∣ueighed himselfe to Sea in a little Boat, and neuer since was euer heard of, nor is he euer like to be, without an exceeding wonder, little lesse then a miracle. In Iune they made another triall about the Spanish wracke, and recouered another Sacre and a Murderer, also he caused to be hewed out of the maine Rocke a paire of large staires for the conuenient landing of goods and passengers, a worke much to the beauty and benefit of the towne.

Secondly, neglected in the safety of their liues by wants of all sorts of mu∣nition. Thirdly, they had beene censured contrary to his Maiesties Lawes, and not allowed them the benefit of their booke as they are in <HI>England,</HI> but by Cap∣taine <HI>Butler.</HI> Fourthly, they were frustrated of many of their couenants, and most extremely pinched and vndone by the extortion of the Magazine, for al∣though their Tobacco was stinted but at two shillings sixpence the pound, yet they pitched their commodities at what rate they pleased. Fifthly, their fatherlesse children are left in little better condition then slaues, for if their Parents die in debt, their children are made as bondmen till the debt be discharged: these things being perfected, there grew a great question of one <HI>Heriot</HI> for plotting of factions and abusing the Gouernour, for which he was condemned to lose his eares, yet he was vsed so fauourably he lost but the part of one in all.</P>

The second was appropria∣ted to the Cities of <HI>Bristol, Exeter</HI> and <HI>Plimoth,</HI> &amp;c. and the West parts of <HI>England,</HI> and all those that would aduenture and ioine with them, and they might make their choise any where betwixt the degrees of 38. and 44. prouided there should bee at least 100. miles distance betwixt these 2. Colonies, each of which had lawes, priuileges and authoritie, for the gouernment and aduancing their seuerall Plantations alike. Now this part of <HI>America</HI> hath formerly beene called <HI>Norumbega, Ʋirginia, Nuskoncus, Penaquida, Cannada,</HI> and such other names as those that ranged the Coast pleased. But because it was so mountainous, rocky and full of Iles, few haue aduentured much to trouble it, but as is formerly related; notwithstan∣ding, that honourable Patron of vertue, Sir <HI>Iohn Popham,</HI> Lord chiefe Iustice of <HI>England,</HI> in the yeere 1606. procured meanes and men to possesse it, and sent Captaine <HI>George Popham</HI> for President, Captaine <HI>Rawley Gilbert</HI> for Admirall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Francis Pop∣ham</HI> Treasurer.</NOTE> Captaine <HI>Edward Harlow</HI> master of the Ordnance, Captaine <HI>Robert Dauis</HI> Sar∣geant-Maior, Captaine <HI>Elis Best</HI> Marshall, Master <HI>Seaman</HI> Secretary, Captaine <HI>Iames Dauis</HI> to be Captaine of the Fort, Master <HI>Gome Carew</HI> chiefe Searcher: all those were of the Councell, who with some hundred more were to stay in the Country: they set saile from <HI>Plimoth</HI> the last of May, and fell with <HI>Monahigan</HI> the eleuenth of August. At <HI>Sagadahock</HI> 9. or 10. leagues southward, they planted themselues at the mouth of a faire nauigable Riuer, but the coast all thereabouts most extreme stony and rocky: that extreme frozen Winter was so cold they could not range nor search the Country, and their prouision so small, they were glad to send all but 45. of their company backe againe: their noble President Captaine <HI>Popham</HI> died, and not long after arriued two ships well prouided of all necessaries to supply them, and some small time after another, by whom vnderstanding of the

death of the Lord chiefe Iustice, and also of Sir <HI>Iohn Gilbert,</HI> whose lands there the President <HI>Rawley Gilbert</HI> was to possesse according to the aduenturers directi∣ons, finding nothing but extreme extremities, they all returned for <HI>England</HI> in the yeere 1608. and thus this Plantation was begunne and ended in one yeere, and the Country esteemed as a cold, barren, mountainous, rocky Desart.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, the right Honourable <HI>Henry</HI> Earle of South-hampton and those of the Ile of <HI>Wight,</HI> imploied Captaine <HI>Edward Harlow</HI> to discouer an Ile supposed about Cape <HI>Cod,</HI> but they found their plots had much abused them, for falling with <HI>Monahigan,</HI> they found onely Cape <HI>Cod</HI> no Ile but the maine, there they detained three Saluages aboord them, called <HI>Pechmo, Monopet</HI> and <HI>Peke∣nimne,</HI> but <HI>Pechmo</HI> leapt ouer board, and got away; and not long after with his consorts cut their Boat from their sterne, got her on shore, and so filled her with sand, and guarded her with Bowes and Arrowes the English lost her: not farre from thence they had three men sorely wounded with Arrowes. Anchoring at the Ile of <HI>Nohone,</HI> the Saluages in their Canowes assaulted the Ship till the Eng∣lish Guns made them retire, yet here they tooke <HI>Sakaweston,</HI> that after he had liued many yeeres in <HI>England</HI> went a Souldier to the warres of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> At <HI>Ca∣pawo</HI> they tooke <HI>Coneconam</HI> and <HI>Epenow,</HI> but the people at <HI>Agawom</HI> vsed them kindly, so with fiue Saluages they returned for <HI>England,</HI> yet Sir <HI>Francis Popham</HI> sent diuers times one Captaine <HI>Williams</HI> to <HI>Monahigan</HI> onely to trade and make core fish, but for any Plantations there was no more speeches. For all this, as I li∣ked <HI>Virginia</HI> well, though not their proceedings, so I desired also to see this coun∣try, and spend some time in trying what I could finde for all those ill rumors and disasters. <HI>From the relations of Captaine</HI> Edward Harlow <HI>and diuers others.</HI></P>

Arriuing at <HI>London,</HI> though some malicious persons sugge∣sted there was no such matter to be had in that so bad abandoned Countrey, for if there had, other could haue found it so well as I; therefore it was to be suspected I had robbed the French men in <HI>New France</HI> or <HI>Cannada,</HI> and the Merchants see me forth seemed not to regard it, yet I found so many promised me such assistance, that I entertained <HI>Michael Cooper</HI> the Master of the Barke, that returned with me and others of the Company: how he dealt with others, or others with him, I know not; but my publike proceeding gaue such encouragement, that it became so well apprehended by some few of the <HI>Ʋirginia</HI> Company, as those proiects

Many shot they made at him, thinking they had slaine him, but so resolute they were to recouer his body, the master of the ship was wounded, and many of his company; And thus they lost him, &amp; not knowing more what to do, returned againe to <HI>England</HI> with nothing, which so had discouraged all your West Countrey men, they neither regarded much their promises, and as little either me or the Countrey, till they saw the <HI>London</HI> ships gone and me in <HI>Plimoth</HI> accor∣ding to my promise, as hereafter shall be related.</P>

But for diuers others that haue ranged those parts since, especially this Countrey now called <HI>New England,</HI> with∣in a kenning sometimes of the shore; some touching in one place, some in ano∣ther; I must intreat them pardon me for omitting them, or if I offend in saying, that their true descriptions were concealed, or neuer were well obserued, or died with the Authors, so that the Coast is yet still but euen as a Coast vnknowne and vndiscouered. I haue had six or seuen seuerall plots of those Northerne parts, so vn∣like each to other, or resemblance of the Country, as they did me no more good then so much waste paper, though they cost me more, it may bee it was not my chance to see the best; but lest others may be deceiued as I was, or through dan∣gerous ignorance hazard themselues as I did, I haue drawne a Map from point to point, Ile to Ile, and Harbour to Harbour, with the Soundings, Sands, Rocks, and Land-markes, as I passed close aboord the shore in a little Boat; although there bee many things to bee obserued, which the haste of other affaires did cause me to omit: for being sent more to get present Commodities, then know∣ledge of any discoueries for any future good, I had not power to search as I would; yet it will serue to direct any shall goe that waies to safe Harbours and the Saluages habitations: what Merchandize and Commodities for their labours they may finde, this following discourse shall plainly demonstrate.</P>

<HEAD>The Description of New England.</HEAD>
<P>THat part we call <HI>New England,</HI> is betwixt the degrees of fortie one and fortie fiue, the very meane betwixt the North pole and the line; but that part this Discourse speaketh of, stretcheth but from <HI>Penobscot</HI> to C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe <HI>Cod,</HI> some seuentie fiue leagues by a right line distant each from other; within which bounds I haue seene at least fortie seuerall habitations vpon the Sea Coast, and sounded about fiue and twentie excellent good Harbours, in ma∣ny whereof there is anchorage for fiue hundred saile of ships of any burden; in some of them for one thousand, and more then two hundred Iles ouer-growne with good Timber of diuers sorts of wood, which doe make so many Harbours, as required a longer time then I had to be well obserued.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The principall Countries or gouernments.</NOTE>The principall habitation Northward we were at, was <HI>Pennobscot:</HI> Southward along the Coast and vp the Riuers, we found <HI>Mecadacut, Segocket, Pemaquid, Nuscoucus, Sagadahock, Aumoughcowgen,</HI> and <HI>Kenebeke</HI>; and to those Countries belong the people of <HI>Segotago, Paghhuntanuck, Pocopassum▪ Taughtanakagnet, Warbigganus, Nassaque, Masherosqueck, Wawrigweck, Mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oquen, Wakcogo, Pa∣sharanack,</HI> &amp;c. To these are alied in confederacy, the Countries of <HI>Ancocisco, Ac∣comynticus, Passataquack, Aggawom,</HI> and <HI>Naemkeck:</HI> All these for any thing I could perceiue, differ little in language, fashion, or gouernment, though most of them be Lords of themselues, yet they hold the <HI>Bashabes</HI> of <HI>Penobscot,</HI> the chiefe and greatest amongst them.</P>
<P>The next I can remember by name, are <HI>Mattahunts,</HI> two pleasant Iles of Groues, Gardens, and Corne fields a league in the Sea from the maine: Then <HI>Totant, Massachuset, Topent, Secassaw, Totheet, Nasnocomacack, Accomack, Cha∣wum, Patuxet, Massasoyts, Pakanokick:</HI> then Cape <HI>Cod,</HI> by which is <HI>Pawmet</HI> and the Ile <HI>Nawset,</HI> of the language and aliance of them of <HI>Chawum</HI>; the others are called <HI>Massachusets,</HI> and differ somewhat in language, custome, and condition: for their Trade and Merchandize, to each of their principall families or habitati∣ons, they haue diuers Townes and people belonging, and by their relations and descriptions, more then twentie seuerall habitations and riuers that stretch them∣selues farre into the Countrey, euen to the Borders of diuers great Lakes, where they kill and take most of their Otters, from <HI>Pennobscot</HI> to <HI>Sagadaboc.</HI> This Coast

is mountainous, and Iles of huge Rockes, but ouer-growne for most part, with most sorts of excellent good woods, for building Houses, Boats, Barks or Ships, with an incredible abundance of most sorts of Fish, much Fowle, and sundry sorts of good Fruits for mans vse.</P>
<P>Betwixt <HI>Sagadahock,</HI> &amp; <HI>Sowocatuck,</HI> there is but two or three Sandy Bayes, but betwixt that and Cape <HI>Iames</HI> very many: especially the Coast of the <HI>Massachu∣sets</HI> is so indifferently mixed with high Clay or Sandy clifts in one place, and the tracts of large long ledges of diuers sorts, and Quaries of stones in other pla∣ces, so strangely diuided with tinctured veines of diuers colours: as Free-stone for building, Slate for tyling, smooth stone to make Furnasses and Forges for Glasse and Iron, and Iron Ore sufficient conueniently to melt in them; but the most part so resembleth the Coast of <HI>Deuonshire,</HI> I thinke most of the clifts would make such Lime-stone: if they bee not of these qualities, they are so like they may deceiue a better iudgement then mine: all which are so neere adioyning to those other aduantages I obserued in these parts, that if the Ore proue as good Iron and Steele in those parts as I know it is within the bounds of the Coun∣trey, I dare ingage my head (hauing but men skilfull to worke the Simples there growing) to haue all things belonging to the building and rigging of ships of any proportion and good Merchandise for their fraught, within a square of ten or foureteene leagues, and it were no hard matter to proue it within a lesse limitation.</P>
<P>And surely by reason of those sandy clifts, and clifts of rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A proofe of an excellent clime▪</NOTE> both which we saw so planted with Gardens and Corne fields, and so well inhabited with a good∣ly, strong, and well proportioned people, besides the greatnesse of the Timber growing on them, the greatnesse of the Fish, and the moderate temper of the aire (for of fiue and forty not a man was sicke, but two that were many yeares diseased before they went, notwithstanding our bad lodging and accidentall diet) who can but approue this a most excellent place, both for health and fertilitie: and of all the foure parts of the world I haue yet seene not inhabited, could I haue but means to transport a Colony, I would rather liue here then any where, and if it did not maintaine it selfe, were we but once indifferently well fitted, let vs starue.</P>
<P>The maine staple from hence to bee extracted for the present,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Staple Commo∣dities present.</NOTE> to produce the rest, is Fish, which howbeit may seeme a meane and a base Commoditie; yet who will but truly take the paines and consider the sequell, I thinke will allow it well worth the labour.

Besides these reasons, mine owne eies that haue seene a great part of those Cities and their Kingdomes (as well as it) can finde no aduantage they haue in Nature but this, they are beautified by the long labour and diligence of industrious people and art; This is onely as God made it when hee created the world: Therefore I conclude, if the heart and intrailes of those Regions were sought, if their Land were cultured, planted, and manured by men of industry, iudgement, and experience; what hope is there, or what need they doubt, hauing the aduan∣tages of the Sea, but it might equalize any of these famous Kingdomes in all commodities, pleasures, and conditions, seeing euen the very hedges doe natural∣ly affoord vs such plentie, as no ship need returne away emptie, and onely vse but the season of the Sea.

I dare boldly say, because I haue seene naturally growing or breeding in those parts, the same materials that all these are made of, they may as well bee had here, or the most part of them within the distance of seuentie leagues for some few ages, as from all those parts, vsing but the same meanes to haue them that they doe; but surely in <HI>Virginia,</HI> their most tender and daintiest fruits or commodities, would be as perfit as theirs, by reason of the heat, if not in <HI>New England,</HI> and with all those aduantages.</P>
<P>First, the ground is so fertill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of the ground ap∣proued.</NOTE> that questionlesse it is capable of producing any Graine, Fruits, or Seeds, you will sow or plant, growing in the Regions afore∣named: But it may be not to that perfection of delicacy, because the Summer is not so hot, and the Winter is more cold in those parts we haue yet tried neere the Sea side, then wee finde in the same height in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>Asia:</HI> yet I made a Garden vpon the top of a Rocky Ile in three and forty degrees and an halfe, foure leagues from the maine in May, that grew so well, as it serued vs for Sallets in Iune and Iuly. All sorts of Cattle may here be bred and fed in the Iles or Penin∣sulaes securely for nothing. In the <HI>Interim,</HI> till they increase (if need be) obser∣uing the seasons, I durst vndertake to haue Corne enough from the Saluages for three hundred men, for a few trifles; and if they should be vntowards, as it is most certaine they will, thirtie or fortie good men will be sufficient to bring them all in subiection, and make this prouision, if they vnderstand what to doe; two hundred whereof may eight or nine moneths in the yeere be imploied in helping the Fisher-men, till the rest prouide other necessaries, fit to furnish vs with other Commodities.</P>
<P>In March, Aprill, May, and halfe Iune, heere is Cod in abundance; In May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seasons for fishing approued.</NOTE> Iune, Iuly, and August, Mullit and Sturgion, whose Roes doe make Cauiare and Puttargo; Herring, if any desire them: I haue taken many out of the bellies of Cods, some in nets; but the Saluages compare the store in the Sea with the haires of their heads: and surely there are an incredible abundance vpon this Coast.
<PB N="212" REF="119"/>
In the end of August, September, October, and Nouember, you may haue Cod againe to make Core-fish or Poore-Iohn: Hake you may haue when the Cod failes in Summer, if you will fish in the night, which is better then Cod. Now each hundred you take here, is as good as two or three hundred in <HI>New found Land</HI>; so that halfe the labour in hooking, splitting and touring, is saued: And you may haue your fish at what market you will, before they haue any in <HI>New found land,</HI> where their fishing is chiefely but in Iune and Iuly, where it is here in March, Aprill, May, September, October and Nouember, as is said; so that by reason of this Plantation, the Merchants may haue their fraught both out and home, which yeelds an aduantage worth consideration. Your Core-fish you may in like manner transport as you see cause, to serue the Ports in <HI>Portugall,</HI> as <HI>Lisbone, Auera, Porta</HI> Port, and diuers others, (or what market you please) be∣fore your Ilanders returne. They being tied to the season in the open Sea, and you hauing a double season, and fishing before your doores, may euery night sleep quietly ashore with good cheere, and what fires you will, or when you please with your wiues and family: they onely and their ships in the maine Ocean, that must carie and containe all they vse, besides their fraught. The Mullits here are in that abundance, you may take them with nets sometimes by hundreds, where at Cape <HI>Blanke</HI> they hooke them; yet those are but a soot and a halfe in length; these two, three, or foure, as oft I haue measured, which makes me suspect they are some other kinde of fish, though they seeme the same, both in fashion and goodnesse. Much Salmon some haue found vp the Riuers as they haue passed, and here the aire is so temperate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imploiment for poore people and fatherlesse children.</NOTE> as all these at any time may be preserued. Now, young Boies and Girles Saluages, or any other bee they neuer such idlers, may turne, carie or returne a fish, without either shame or any great paine: He is very idle that is past twelue yeeres of age and cannot doe so much, and she is very old that cannot spin a threed to make Engins to catch a fish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The facilitie of the Plantation.</NOTE>For their transportation, the ships that goe there to fish may transport the first: who for their passage will spare the charge of double manning their ships, which they must do in <HI>New found land</HI> to get their fraught; but one third part of that com∣pany are onely proper to serue a stage, carie a Barrow, and turne Poore-Iohn; not∣withstanding, they must haue meat, drinke, clothes, &amp; passage so well as the rest. Now all I desire is but this, That those that voluntarily will send shipping, should make here the best choice they can, or accept such as shall bee presented them to serue them at that rate: and their ships returning leaue such with me, with the value of that they should receiue comming home, in such prouisions and neces∣sarie tooles, armes, bedding, apparell, salt, nets, hookes, lines, and such like, as they spare of the remainings; who till the next returne may keepe their Boats, and doe them many other profitable offices. Prouided, I haue men of abilitie to teach them their functions, and a company fit for Souldiers to be ready vpon any occasion, because of the abuses that haue beene offered the poore Saluages, and the libertie that both French and English, or any that will, haue to deale with them as they please; whose disorders will be hard to reforme, and the longer the worse: Now such order with facilitie might be taken, with euery Port, Towne, or Citie, with free power to conuert the benefit of their fraughts to what aduan∣tage they please, and increase their numbers as they see occasion, who euer as they are able to subsist of themselues, may begin the new Townes in <HI>New England,</HI> in memory of their old: which freedome being confined but to the necessitie of the generall good, the euent (with Gods helpe) might produce an honest, a no∣ble, and a profitable emulation.</P>

<P><PB N="214" REF="120"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">A description of the Countrey in particular, and their situations.</NOTE>But to returne a little more to the particulars of this Countrey, which I in∣termingle thus with my proiects and reasons, not being so sufficiently yet ac∣quainted in those parts, to write fully the estate of the Sea, the Aire, the Land, the Fruits, their Rocks, the People, the Gouernment, Religion, Territories, Li∣mitations, Friends and Foes: But as I gathered from their niggardly relations in a broken language, during the time I ranged those Countries, &amp;c. the most Nor∣therne part I was at, was the Bay of <HI>Pennobscot,</HI> which is East and West, North and South, more then ten leagues: but such were my occasions, I was constrai∣ned to be satisfied of them I found in the Bay, that the Riuer ranne farre vp into the Land, and was well inhabited with many people, but they were from their habitations, either fishing amongst the Iles, or hunting the Lakes and Woods for Deere and Beuers: the Bay is full of great Iles of one, two, six or eight miles in length, which diuides it into many faire and excellent good Harbours. On the East of it are the <HI>Tarrentines,</HI> their mortall enemies, where inhabit the French, as they report, that liue with those people as one Nation or Family: And Northwest of <HI>Pennobscot</HI> is <HI>Mecaddacut,</HI> at the foot of a high Mountaine, a kinde of fortresse against the <HI>Tarrentines,</HI> adioyning to the high Mountaines of <HI>Pen∣nobscot,</HI> against whose feet doth beat the Sea; but ouer all the Land, Iles, or other impediments, you may well see them foureteene or eighteene leagues from their situation. <HI>Segocket</HI> is the next, then <HI>Nuskoucus, Pemmaquid,</HI> and <HI>Sagadahock:</HI> vp this Riuer, where was the Westerne Plantation, are <HI>Aumoughcawgen, Kinne∣beke,</HI> and diuers others, where are planted some Corne fields. Along this Riuer thirtie or fortie miles, I saw nothing but great high clifts of barren Rocks ouer∣growne with Wood, but where the Saluages dwell there the ground is excellent salt, and fertill. Westward of this Riuer is the Country of <HI>Aucocisco,</HI> in the bot∣tome of a large deepe Bay, full of many great Iles, which diuides it into many good Harbours. <HI>Sawocotuck</HI> is the next, in the edge of a large Sandy Bay, which hath many Rockes and Iles, but few good Harbours, but for Barkes I yet know; but all this Coast to <HI>Pennobscot,</HI> and as farre as I could see East∣ward of it is nothing, but such high craggy clifty Rockes and stony Iles, that I wonder such great Trees could grow vpon so hard foundations. It is a Coun∣trey rather to affright then delight one, and how to describe a more plaine spectacle of desolation, or more barren, I know not, yet are those rocky Iles so furnished with good Woods, Springs, Fruits, Fish and Fowle, and the Sea the strangest Fish-pond I euer saw, that it makes me thinke, though the coast be rocky and thus affrightable, the Vallies and Plaines and interior parts may well notwith∣standing be very fertill. But there is no Country so fertill hath not some part bar∣ren, and <HI>New-England</HI> is great enough to make many Kingdomes and Countries, were it all inhabited. As you passe the coast still westward, <HI>Accominticus</HI> and <HI>Passataquack</HI> are two conuenient Harbours for small Barkes; and a good Coun∣try within their craggy clifts. <HI>Augoan</HI> is the next: this place might content a right curious iudgement, but there are many sands at the entrance of the Harbour, and the worst is, it is imbayed too farre from the deepe Sea; here are many rising hils, and on their tops and descents are many corne fields and de∣lightfull groues: On the East is an Ile of two or three leagues in length, the one halfe plaine marish ground, fit for pasture or salt Ponds, with many faire high groues of Mulbery trees and Gardens; there is also Okes, Pines, Walnuts, and other wood to make this place an excellent habitation, being a good and safe Harbour.</P>

But because the French had got their trade, I had no leisure to discouer it: the Iles of <HI>Mattahunts</HI> are on the west side of this Bay, where are many Iles and some Rocks that appeare a great height aboue the water like the Pyramides in Aegypt, and amongst them many good Harbours, and then the country of the <HI>Massachusits,</HI> which is the Paradice of all those parts, for here are many Iles planted with Corne, Groues, Mulberies, saluage Gardens and good Harbours, the Coast is for the most part high clayie sandy clifts, the sea Coast as you passe shewes you all along large Corne fields, and great troupes of well proportioned people: but the French hauing remained here neere six weekes, left nothing for vs to take occasion to examine the Inhabi∣tants relations, <HI>viz.</HI> if there be three thousand people vpon those Iles, and that the Riuer doth pierce many daies iourney the entrailes of that Country: we found the people in those parts very kinde, but in their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry no lesse valiant, for vpon a quarrell we fought with forty or fifty of them, till they had spent all their Ar∣rowes, and then we tooke six or seuen of their Canowes, which towards the eue∣ning they ransomed for Beuer skinnes, and at <HI>Quonahasit</HI> falling out there but with one of them, he with three others crossed the Harbour in a Canow to cer∣taine rockes whereby wee must passe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Indian slaine, another shot.</NOTE> and there let flie their Arrowes for our shot, till we were out of danger, yet one of them was slaine, and another shot through his thigh.</P>

This Cape is made by the maine Sea on the one side, and a great Bay on the other in forme of a Sickell, on it doth inhabit the people of <HI>Pawmet,</HI> and in the bottome of the Bay them of <HI>Chawum:</HI> towards the South and South-west of this Cape, is found a long and dangerous shoule of rocks and sand, but so farre as I incercled it, I found thirty fathome water and a strong currant, which makes mee thinke there is a chanell about this Shoule, where is the best and greatest fish to be had winter and summer in all the Coun∣try; but the Saluages say there is no Chanell, but that the Shoales beginne from the maine at <HI>Pawm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> to the Ile of <HI>Nawset,</HI> and so extends beyond their know∣ledge into the Sea.

Consider what were the beginnings and endings of the Monar∣chies of the Chaldeans, the Syrians, the Grecians and Romans, but this one rule; what was it they would not doe for the good of their common weale, or their mother City? For example: <HI>Rome,</HI> what made her such a Monar∣chesse, but onely the aduentures of her youth, not in riots at home, but in dangers abroad, and the iustice and iudgement out of their experiences when they grew aged; what was their ruine and hurt but this, the excesse of idle∣nesse, the fondnesse of parents, the want of experience in Maiestrates, the ad∣miration of their vndeserued honours, the contempt of true merit, their vniust iealousies, their politike incredulities, their hypocriticall seeming goodnesse and their deeds of secret lewdnesse; finally in fine, growing onely formall tempo∣rists, all that their Predecessors got in many yeeres they lost in a few daies: those by their paines and vertues became Lords of the world, they by their case and vices became slaues to their seruants; this is the difference betwixt the vse of armes in the field, and on the monuments of stones, the golden age and the lea∣den age, prosperity and misery, iustice and corruption, substance and sha∣dowes, words and deeds, experience and imagination, making common weales, and marring common weales, the fruits of vertue, and the conclusions of vice.</P>

<P>And lest any should thinke the toile might be insupportable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Planters pleasures and profit.</NOTE> though these things may bee had by labour and diligence; I assure my selfe there are who delight extremely in vaine pleasure, that take much more paines in <HI>England</HI> to enioy it, then I should doe here to gaine wealth sufficient, and yet I thinke they should not haue halfe such sweet content: for our pleasure here is still gaines, in <HI>England</HI> charges and losse; here nature and liberty affoords vs that free∣ly which in <HI>England</HI> we want, or it costeth vs deerely.

Strange they thought it, that a Barke of threescore tuns with foure guns should stand vpon such termes, they being eightie expert Sea-men, in an excellent ship of one hundred and fortie tuns, and thirty six cast Peeces and Murderers: But when they knew our Captaine, so many of them had beene his Souldiers, and they but lately runne from <HI>Tunis,</HI> where they had stolne this ship, wanted victuall, and in combustion amongst themselues, would haue yeelded all to his protection, or wafted vs any whither: but those mutinies occasioned vs to reiect their offer, which afterward we all repented.

They fought by courtesie releefe of vs, who gaue them such faire promises, as at last they betraied Captaine <HI>Wollistone</HI> his Lieutenant, and foure or fiue of his men aboord vs, and then prouided to take the rest perforce. Now my part was to be prisoner in the Gun-roome, and not to speake to any of them vpon my life, yet had <HI>Barra</HI> knowledge what I was. Then <HI>Barra</HI> perceiuing well those French intents, made ready to fight, and <HI>Wollistone</HI> as resolutely regarded not their threats, which caused vs demurre vpon the mat∣ter longer some sixteene houres, and then returned them againe Captaine <HI>Wolli∣stone</HI> and all their Prisoners, and some victuall also vpon a small composition: But whilest we were bartering thus with them; a Caruill before our faces got vnder the Castle of <HI>Gratiosa,</HI> from whence they beat vs with their Ordnance.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Scotch prise.</NOTE>Not long after we tooke a <HI>Scot</HI> fraught from Saint <HI>Michaels</HI> to <HI>Bristow,</HI> he had better fortune then the other; for hauing but taken a Boats loading of Sugar, Marmelade, Suckets, and such like, we descried foure saile, after whom we stood, who forling their maine Sailes attended vs to fight, but our French spirits were content onely to perceiue they were English red Crosses. Within a very small time after wee chased 4. Spanish ships that came from the <HI>Indies,</HI> we fought with them foure or fiue houres, tore their sailes and sides with many a shot betwixt wind and weather, yet not daring to boord them, lost them, for which all the Sailers euer after hated the Captaine as a professed coward.</P>

<P>The next was a ship of <HI>Holland,</HI> which had lost her Consorts in the Streights of <HI>Magilans,</HI> going for the South sea, she was put roomy, she also these French men with faire promises, cunningly betraied to come aboord them to shew their Com∣mission, and so made prise of all: the most of the <HI>Dutch-men</HI> we tooke aboord the <HI>Admirall,</HI> and manned her with <HI>French-men,</HI> that within two or three nights after ran away with her for <HI>France,</HI> the wounded <HI>Spaniards</HI> we set on shore on the Ile of <HI>Tercera▪</HI> the rest we kept to saile the Caruill.</P>

<P>Two moneths they kept me in this manner to manage their fights against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and bee a Prisoner when they tooke any English.

<P>But to preuent this choise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My escape from the French men.</NOTE> in the end of such a storme that beat them all vn∣der hatches, I watched my opportunitie to get a shore in their Boat, whereinto in the darke night I secretly got, and with a halfe Pike that lay by me, put a drift for <HI>Rat</HI> Ile: but the currant was so strong, and the Sea so great, I went a drift to Sea, till it pleased God the wind so turned with the tide, that although I was all this fearefull night of gusts and raine in the Sea the space of twelue houres, when many ships were driuen ashore, and diuers split: (and being with skulling and bayling the water tired, I expected each minute would sinke me) at last I ar∣riued in an O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zy Ile by <HI>Charowne,</HI> where certaine Fowlers found me neere drow∣ned, and halfe dead, with water, cold, and hunger.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">My returne for England.</NOTE>Leauing thus my businesse in <HI>France</HI> I returned to <HI>Plimoth,</HI> to finde them had thus buried me amongst the French; and not onely buried me, but with so much infamy as such treacherous cowards could suggest to excuse their villanies. The Chiefetaines of this mutiny that I could finde, I laid by the heeles, the rest like themselues confessed the truth, as you haue heard. Now how I haue or could preuent these accidents, hauing no more meanes, I rest at your censures; but to proceed to the matter; yet must I sigh and say, How oft hath Fortune in the world (thinke I) brought slauery, freedome, and turned all diuersly. <HI>Newfoundland</HI> I haue heard at the first, was held as desperate a fishing as this I proiect for <HI>New England, Placentia,</HI> and the <HI>Banke</HI> nere also as doubtfull to the French: But for all the disasters hapned me, the businesse is the same it was, and the fiue ships went from <HI>London,</HI> whereof one was reported more then three hundred tunnes, found fish so much, that neither <HI>Izeland</HI> man, nor <HI>Newfoundland</HI> man I could heare of hath bin there, will go any more to either place, if they may go thither. So that vpon the good returne of my <HI>Vice-Admirall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The successe of my Vice-Admi∣rall.</NOTE> this yeere are gone 4 or 5 sailes, and from <HI>London</HI> as many, only to make voyages of profit: where from <HI>Plimoth,</HI> as if all the English had bin there till my returne, put all their returnes together, they would scarce make one a sauour of neere a dozen I could nominate, except one sent by Sir <HI>Francis Popam</HI>; though there be fish sufficient, as I am perswaded, to fraugh yerely foure or fiue hundred Saile, or as many as will goe. For this fishing stretcheth along the Sea Coast from Cape <HI>Iames</HI> to <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> which is seuen or eight hundred miles at the least, and hath his course in the deepes, and by the shore, all the yere long, keeping their hants and feedings, as the beasts of the field, and the birds of the aire. But all men are not such as they should be, that haue vn∣dertaken those voyages: All the <HI>Romans</HI> were not <HI>Scipiocs,</HI> nor <HI>Carthagenians Hanibals,</HI> nor all the <HI>Genw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses Columbusses▪</HI> nor all the <HI>Spaniards Courteses:</HI> had they diued no deeper in the secrets of their discoueries then we, or stopped at such doubts and poore accidentall chances, they had neuer beene remembred as they are, yet had they no such certainties to begin as we.</P>
<P>But to conclude, <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eue</HI> did first begin this innocent worke to plant the earth to remaine to posterity, but not without labour, trouble, and industry. <HI>Noe</HI> and his family began againe the second Plantation; and their seed as it still increased, hath still planted new Countries, and one Countrey another, and so the world to that estate it is: but not without much hazard, trauell, mor∣talities, discontents, and many disasters. Had those worthy Fathers, and their memorable off-spring, not beene more diligent for vs now in these ages, then we are to plant that yet are vnplanted for the after liuers. Had the seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> our Sauiour Christ, and his Apostles, exposed themselues to no more dangers to teach the Gospell then we, euen wee our selues had at this present beene as saluage, and as miserable as the most barbarous Saluage, yet vnciuilized. The <HI>Hebrewes</HI> and <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> the <HI>Gothes,</HI> the <HI>Grecians,</HI> the <HI>Romanes,</HI> and the rest, what was it they would not vndertake to inlarge their Teritories, enrich their subiects, resist their enemies. Those that were the founders of those great Monarchies and their vertues, were no siluered idle golden Pharises, but indu∣strious Iron steeled Publicans: They regarded more prouisions and necessaries
<PB N="227" REF="126"/>
for their people, then Iewels, riches, ease, or delight for themselues; Riches were their Seruants, not their Masters. They ruled (as Fathers, not as Titants) their people as Children, not as Slaues; there was no disaster could discourage them; and let none thinke they incountred not with all manner of incumbran∣ces. And what hath euer beene the worke of the greatest Princes of the Earth, but planting of Countries, and ciuilizing barbarous and inhumane Nations to ciuilitie and humanitie, whose eternall actions fills our Histories.</P>
<P>Lastly, the <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whose euer-liuing actions before our eies will testifie with them our idlenesse, and ingratitude to all posterities, and the neglect of our duties, in our pietie and religion. We owe our God, our King and Countrey, and want of Charitie to those poore Saluages, whose Countrey wee challenge, vse and possesse; except wee be but made to vse, and marre what our fore-fathers made, or but onely tell what they did, or esteeme our selues too good to take the like paines. Was it vertue in them to prouide that doth maintaine vs, and basenesse in vs to doe the like for others? Surely no. Then seeing we are not borne for our selues, but each to help other, and our abilities are much alike at the houre of our birth, and the minute of our death: seeing our good deeds or our bad by faith in Christs merits, is all we haue, to carie our soules to heauen or hell. See∣ing honor is our liues ambition, and our ambition after death to haue an honora∣ble memory of our life: and seeing by no meanes we would be abated of the dig∣nities and glories of our predecessors, let vs imitate their vertues to be worthily their successors: to conclude with <HI>Lucretius,</HI></P>

ships; <HI>Hambrough</HI> six hundred; <HI>Emden</HI> lately a Fisher towne, one thousand foure hundred, whose customes by fishing hath made them so powerfull as they be. <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> not much greater then <HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> hath thirty walled Townes, foure hundred Villages, and twenty thousand saile of Ships and Hoies; three thousand six hundred are Fisher-men, whereof one hundred are Doggers, seuen hundred Pinkes and Well-Boats, seuen hundred Fraud-boats, Britters, and Tode-boats, with thirteene hundred Busses, besides three hundred that yeerely fish about <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> where they sell their fish for Gold: and fifteene yeeres agoe they had more then an hundred and sixteene thousand Sea-faring-men.</P>
<P>These fishing ships doe take yeerely two hundred thousand last of fish, twelue barrels to a last, which amounts to 300000. pounds by the fisher mens price, that 14. yeeres agoe did pay for their tenths three hundred thousand pound, which venting in <HI>Pumerland, Sprustia, Denmarke, Lefeland, Russia, Swethland, Germany, Netherlands, England,</HI> or else where, &amp;c. makes their returnes in a yeere about threescore and ten hundred thousand pounds, which is seuen millions; and yet in <HI>Holland</HI> there is neither matter to build ships nor merchandize to set them forth, yet by their industry they as much increase as other nations decay; but lea∣uing these vncertainties as they are, of this I am certaine.</P>
<P>That the coast of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the North Sea with <HI>Island</HI> and the <HI>Sound, Newfound-land</HI> and Cape <HI>Blanke,</HI> doe serue all Europe, as well the land townes as ports, and all the Christian shipping, with these sorts of staple fish, which is transported from whence it is taken many a thousand mile, <HI>viz.</HI> Herring, salt Fish, Poore-Iohn, Sturgion, Mullit, Tunny, Porgos, Cauiare, Buttargo.</P>
<P>Now seeing all these sorts of fish, or the most part of them may be had in a land more fertill, temperate and plentifull of all necessaries, for the building of ships, boats and houses, and the nourishment of man, the seasons are so proper, and the fishings so neere the habitations we may there make, that <HI>New-England</HI> hath much aduantage of the most of those parts, to serue all Europe farre cheaper then they can, who at home haue neither wood, salt, nor food, but at great rates, at Sea nothing but what they carry in their ships, an hundred or two hundred leagues from the habitation. But <HI>New-Englands</HI> fishings is neere land, where is helpe of Wood, Water, Fruits, Fowles, Corne or other refreshings needfull, and the <HI>Ter∣ceras, Mederas, Canaries, Spaine, Portugall, Prouaues, Sauoy, Sicillia,</HI> and all <HI>Italy,</HI> as conuenient markets for our dry fish, greene fish, Sturgion, Mullit, Ca∣uiare and Buttargo, as <HI>Norway, Swethland, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tuania</HI> or <HI>Germany</HI> for their Her∣ring, which is heare also in abundance for taking; they returning but Wood, Pitch, Tar, Sope-ashes, Cordage, Flax, Wax, and such like commodities; wee Wines, Oiles, Sugars, Silkes, and such merchandize as the Straits offoord, where∣by our profit may equalize theirs, besides the increase of shipping and Marriners: and for proofe hereof.</P>

Here I must intreat a little your fauours to digresse, they did not kill the Eng∣lish in <HI>Ʋirginia,</HI> because they were Christians: but for their weapons and Cop∣per, which were rare nouelties; but now they feare we may beat them out of their dens, which Lions and Tigers will not admit but by force. But must this be an argument for an English man, and discourage any in <HI>Virginia</HI> or <HI>New England:</HI> No, for I haue tried them both, as you may reade at large in the Historie of <HI>Ʋir∣ginia</HI>; notwithstanding since I came from thence, the Honourable Company hath beene humble suiters to his Maiestie, to get vagabonds and condemned men to goe thither; nay, so the businesse hath beene so abused, that so much scor∣ned was the name of <HI>Ʋirginia,</HI> some did chuse to be hanged ere they would goe thither, and were: Yet for all the worst of spight, detraction, and discourage∣ment, and this iamentable massacre, there is more honest men now suiters to goe, then euer hath beene constrained knaues. And it is not vnknowne to most men of vnderstanding, how happy many of those Collumners hath thought them∣selues that they might be admitted; and yet pay for their passage to goe now to <HI>Ʋirginia,</HI> and I feare mee there goeth too many of those, that hath shif∣ted heere till they could no longer; and they will vse that qualitie there till they hazard all.</P>
<P>To range this Countrey of <HI>New England</HI> in like manner, I had but eight, as is said, and amongst their bruit conditions, I met many of their silly encounters, and I giue God thankes, without any hurt at all to me, or any with mee. When your West-Countrey men were so wounded and tormented with the Saluages, though they had all the Politicke directions that had beene gathered from all the secret informations could be heard of, yet they found little, and returned with no∣thing. I speak not this out of vaine-glory, as it may be some gleaners, or some who were neuer there may censure me; but to let all men be assured by those examples, what those Saluages are, that thus strangely doe murder and betray our Country∣men: but to the purpose;</P>

our English Coast, whereby they failed of their supplies. It is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They liued two yeeres without supply.</NOTE> there hath beene taken one thousand Bases at a draught; and in one night twelue Hogsheads of Herrings: but when they wanted all necessaries both for fishing and sustinance, but what they could get with their naked industry, they indured most ex∣treme wants, hauing beene now neere two yeeres without any supply to any purpose, it is a wonder how they should subsist, much lesse so to resist the Salua∣ges, fortifie themselues, plant sixtie acres of Corne, besides their Gardens that were well replenished with many vsuall fruits. But in the beginning of Iuly came in two ships of Master <HI>Westons,</HI> though we much wanted our selues,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Westons</HI> Plantati∣on.</NOTE> yet we re∣leeued them what we could: and to requite vs, they destroied our Corne and Fruits then planted, and did what they could to haue done the like to vs. At last they were transported to <HI>Wichaguscusset</HI> at the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> where they abused the Saluages worse then vs. We hauing neither Trade, nor scarce any thing re∣maining, God sent in one Master <HI>Iones,</HI> and a ship of <HI>Westons</HI> had beene at <HI>Mona∣higan</HI> amongst the Fisher-men, that for Beuer skinnes and such Merchandize as wee had, very well refreshed vs, though at deere rates. <HI>Weston</HI> left also his men a small Barke, and much good prouision, and so set saile for <HI>England.</HI> Then wee ioyned with them to trade to the Southward of Cape <HI>Cod,</HI> twice or thrice wee were forced to returne; first by the death of their Gouernor; then the sicknesse of Captaine <HI>Standish.</HI> At last our Gouernor Master <HI>Bradford</HI> vndertooke it him∣selfe to haue found the passage betwixt the Shoules and the Maine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of <HI>Tusquantum.</HI></NOTE> then <HI>Tusquan∣tum</HI> our Pilot died, so that we returned to the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> where we found the trade spoiled, and nothing but complaints betwixt the Saluages and the English. At <HI>Nawset</HI> we were kindly vsed and had good trade, though we lost our Barge, the Saluages carefully kept both her wracke, and some ten Hosheads of Corne three moneths, and so we returned some by land, some in the ship.</P>
<P>Captaine <HI>Standish</HI> being recouered, went to fetch them both,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tusquantum</HI> at his death desired the English to pray he might go dwell with the English mens God, for theirs was a good God.</NOTE> and traded at <HI>Namasket</HI> and <HI>Monomete,</HI> where the people had the plague, a place much fre∣quented with <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French.</HI> Here the <HI>Sachem</HI> put a man to death for killing his fellow at play, wherein they are so violent, they will play their coats from their backs, and also their wiues, though many miles from them. But our prouisi∣on decaying, <HI>Standish</HI> is sent to <HI>Mattachist,</HI> where they pretended their wonted loue; yet it plainly appeared they intended to kill him. Escaping thence, wee went to <HI>Monomete,</HI> where we found nothing but bad countenances. Heare one <HI>Wittuwamat</HI> a notable villaine, would boast how many French and English hee had slaine: This Champion presenting a Dagger to the <HI>Sachem Canacum</HI> he had got from the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They contriue to murder all the English.</NOTE> occasioned vs to vnderstand how they had contriued to murder all the English in the Land, but hauing such a faire opportunitie, they would begin heere with vs. Their scornfull vsage made the Captaine so passio∣nate to appease his anger and choler, their intent made many faire excuses for sa∣tisfaction: <HI>Scar</HI> a lusty Saluage, alwaies seeming the most to effect vs, bestowed on vs the best presents he had without any recompence, saying; Hee was rich enough to bestow such fauours on his friends, yet had vndertaken to kill the Captaine himselfe, but our vigilencies so preuented the aduantage they expected, we safely returned, little suspecting in him any such treachery.</P>
<P>During this time a <HI>Dutch</HI> ship was driuen a shore at <HI>Massasowat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sicknesse of King <HI>Massasowat.</HI></NOTE> whose King lay very sicke, now because it is a generall custome then for all their friends to visit them: Master <HI>Winslow,</HI> and Master <HI>Hamden,</HI> with <HI>Habamok</HI> for their guide, were sent with such Cordialls as they had to salute him; by the way they so oft heard the King was dead, <HI>Habamok</HI> would breake forth in those words, My louing <HI>Sa∣chem,</HI> my louing <HI>Sachem,</HI> many haue I knowne, but neuer any like thee, nor shall euer see the like amongst the Saluages; for he was no lier, nor bloudy and cruell like other <HI>Indians,</HI> in anger soone reclaimed, he would be ruled by reason, not scorning the aduice of meane men, and gouerned his men better with a few strokes, then others with many: truly louing where he loued, yea he feared wee

had not a faithfull friend left amongst all his Countrey-men, shewing how oft he had restrained their malice, much more with much passion he spoke to this pur∣pose, till at last we arriued where we found the <HI>Dutchmen</HI> but newly gone, and the house so full we could hardly get in. By their charmes they distempered vs that were well, much more him that was sicke, women rubbing him to keepe heat in him; but their charmes ended, vnderstanding of vs, though he had lost his sight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His cure by the English.</NOTE> his vnderstanding failed not; but taking <HI>Winslow</HI> by the hand, said, Art thou <HI>Winslow,</HI> Oh <HI>Winslow,</HI> I shall neuer see thee againe! <HI>Hobamock</HI> telling him what restauratiues they had brought, he desired to taste them, with much adoe they got a little Confexion of many comfortable Conserues into his mouth, as it desolued he swallowed it, then desoluing more of it in water, they scraped his tongue, which was al furred &amp; swolne, and washed his mouth, and then gaue him more of it to eat, and in his drinke, that wrought such an alteration in him in two or three houres, his eies opened to our great contents; with this and such brothes as they there prouided for him, it pleased God he recouered: and thus the manner of his sicknesse and cure caused no small admiration amongst them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings thank∣fulnesse.</NOTE>During the time of their stay to see his recouery, they had sent to <HI>New Plimoth</HI> for diuers good things for him, which he tooke so kindly, that he fully reuealed all the former conspiracies against vs, to which he had oft beene moued; and how that all the people of <HI>Powmet, Nawset, Succonet, Mattachist, Manamet, Augawam,</HI> and <HI>Capawac,</HI> were ioyned to murder vs; therefore as we respected our liues, kill them of <HI>Massachuset</HI> that were the authors; for take away the principals and the plot wil cease, thus taking our leaues, &amp; arriuing at our fort, we found our braue li∣berall friend of <HI>Pamet</HI> drawing <HI>Standish</HI> to their Ambuscados, which being thus discouered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bad example.</NOTE> we sent him away, as though he knew not suspected any thing. Them at the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> some were so vilde they serued the Saluages for victuall, the rest sent vs word the Saluages were so insolent, they would assault them though against their Commission, so fearefull they were to breake their Commission, so much time was spent in consultations, they all were famished, till <HI>Wassapinewat</HI> againe came and told them the day of their execution was at hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Stan∣dish</HI> sent to suppresse the Saluages.</NOTE>Then they appointed <HI>Standish</HI> with eight chosen men, vnder colour of Trade to catch them in their owne trap at <HI>Massachuset,</HI> &amp; acquaint it with the English in the Towne, where arriuing he found none in the Barke, and most of the rest with∣out Armes, or scarce clothes, wandering abroad, all so sencelesly secure, he more then wondered they were not all slaine, with much adoe he got the most of them to their Towne. The Saluages suspecting their plots discouered, <HI>Pecksnot</HI> a great man, and of as great a spirit, came to <HI>Habamak,</HI> who was then amongst them, saying; Tell <HI>Standish</HI> we know he is come to kill vs, but let him begin when he dare. Not long after many would come to the Fort and whet their Kniues be∣fore him, with many brauing speeches. One amongst the rest was by <HI>Wittawa∣mat</HI> bragging he had a Knife, that on the handle had the picture of a womans face, but at home I haue one hath killed both French &amp; English, and that hath a mans face on it, and by and by these two must marrie: but this here, by and by shall see, and by and by eat, but not speake; Also <HI>Pecksnot</HI> being of a greater stature then the Captaine, told him, though he were a great Captaine he was but a little man, and I though no <HI>Sachem,</HI> yet I am of great strength and courage. These things <HI>Standish</HI> bare patiently for the present; but the next day seeing he could not get many of them together, but these two Roarers, and two more being in a conue∣nient roome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two desperate Saluages slaine.</NOTE> and his company about him, <HI>Standish</HI> feased on <HI>Pecksnots</HI> Knife then hanging about his necke, wherewith he slew him, and the rest slew <HI>Wittuwamat</HI> and the other Saluage, but the youth they tooke, who being Brother to <HI>Wittuwa∣mat,</HI> and as villanous as himselfe, was hanged. It is incredible how many wounds they indured, catching at their weapons without any feare or bruit, till the last gasp. <HI>Habamack</HI> stood by all this time very silent, but all ended, he said, Yester∣day <HI>Pecksnot</HI> bragged of his strength and stature, but I see you are big enough to lay him on the ground.</P>

The next day they met with a file of Saluages that let fly their Arrowes, shot for shot till <HI>Hobamack</HI> shewed himselfe, and then they fled. For all this, a Saluage Boy to shew his inno∣cency, came boldly vnto vs and told vs: Had the English Fugitiues but finished the three Canowes they were a making, to haue taken the ship, they would haue done as much to all the English, which was onely the cause they had forborne so long. But now consulting and considering their estates, those that went in the Pinnace to <HI>Barty</HI> Iles to get passage for <HI>England,</HI> the rest to <HI>New Plimoth,</HI> where they were kindly entertained. The <HI>Sachem Obtak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est,</HI> &amp; <HI>Powas,</HI> and diuers other were guilty, the three fugitiues in their fury there slew; but not long after so di∣stracted were those poore scattered people, they left their habitations, liuing in swamps, where wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h cold and infinite diseases they endured much mortalitie, su∣ing for peace, and crying the God of <HI>England</HI> is angry with them. Thus you see where God pleases, as some flourish, others perish.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1623"/> Now on all hands they prepare their ground, and about the middest of Aprill, in a faire season they begin to plant till the latter end of May; but to God pleased,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An extreme drought.</NOTE> that in six weekes after the latter setting there scarce fell any raine; so that the stalke was first set, began to care ere it came to halfe growth, and the last not like to yeeld any thing at all. Our Beanes also seemed so withered, we iudged all vt∣terly dead, that now all our hopes were ouerthrowne, and our ioy turned into mourning. And more to our sorrow, we heard of the twice returne of the <HI>Para∣gon▪</HI> that now the third time was sent vs three moneths agoe, but no newes of her: onely the signes of a wracke we saw on the Coast which wee iudged her. This caused not euery of vs to enter into a priuate consideration betwixt God and our consciences, but most solemnly to humble our selues before the Lord by fasting and praying, to releeue our deiected spirits by the comforts of his mercy. In the morning when wee assembled all together, the skies were as cleere, and the drought as like to continue as euer; yet our exercise continued eight or nine houres. Before our departure, the skies were all ouer-cast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonderfull blessing &amp; signe of Gods loue.</NOTE> and on the next mor∣ning distilled such soft, sweet, moderate showers, continuing foureteene daies, mixed with such seasonable weather, as it was hard to say, whether our withered Corne, or drooping affections were most quickned and reuiued; such was the bounty and mercy of God. Of this the <HI>Indians</HI> by the meanes of <HI>Hobamock</HI> tooke notice, who seeing vs vse this exercise in the midst of the weeke, said; It was but three daies since Sunday, and desired to know the reason; which when hee vnd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rstood, he and all of them admired the goodnesse of God towards vs, shew∣ing the difference betwixt their coniurations and our praiers, and what stormes and dangers they oft receiue thereby. To expresse our thankfulnesse, wee assem∣bled together another day, as before, and either the next morning, or not long after, came in two ships to supply vs, and all their Passengers well except one, and he presently recouered. For vs, notwithstanding all these wants, there was not a sicke person amongst vs. The greater ship we returned fraught; the other wee sent to the Southward, to trade vnder the command of Captaine <HI>Altom.</HI> So that God be thanked, we desire nothing, but what we will returne Commodities to the value.</P>

They say, at first there was no King but <HI>Kiehtan</HI> that dwelleth farre westerly aboue the heauens, whither all good men goe when they die, and haue plentie of all things. The bad men goe thither also and knocke at the doore, but he bids them goe wander in end∣lesse want and miserie, for they shall not stay there. They neuer saw <HI>Kiehtan,</HI> but they hold it a great charge and dutie, that one age teach another; and to him they make feasts, and cry and sing for plentie and victorie, or any thing is good. They haue another Power they call <HI>Hobam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck,</HI> which wee conceiue the Deuill, and vpon him they call to cure their wounds and diseases: when they are curable he perswades them he sent them, because they haue displeased him; but if they be mortall, then he saith, <HI>Kiehtan</HI> sent them, which makes them neuer call on him in their sicknesse. They say this <HI>Hobamock</HI> appeares to them somtimes like a Man, a Deere, or an Eagle, but most commonly like a Snake; not to all, but only to their <HI>Powahs</HI> to cure diseases, and <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deses,</HI> which is one of the chiefe next the King, and so bold in the warres, that they thinke no weapon can kill them: and those are such as coniure in <HI>Ʋirginia,</HI> and cause the people to doe what they list.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Gouern∣ment.</NOTE>For their Gouernment: euery <HI>Sachem</HI> is not a King, but their great <HI>Sachems</HI> haue diuers <HI>Sachems</HI> vnder their protection, paying them tribute, and dare make no warres without his knowledge; but euery <HI>Sachem</HI> taketh care for the Widowes, Orphans, the aged and maimed, nor will they take any to first wife, but them in birth equall to themselues, although they haue many inferior Wiues and Concu∣bins that attend on the principall; from whom he neuer parteth, but any of the rest when they list, they inherit by succession, and euery one knowes their owne bounds. To his men, hee giueth them land, also bounded, and what Deere they kill in that circuit, he hath the sore-part; but it in the water, onely the skin: But they account none a man, till hee hath done some notable exploit: the men are most imploied in hunting, the women in slauery; the younger obey the elders: their names are variable; they haue harlots and honest women: the harlots neuer marrie, or else are widowes. They vse diuorcement, and the King commonly pu∣nisheth all offenders himselfe: when a maid is maried, she cutteth her haire, and keepes her head couered till it be growne againe. Their arts, games, musicke, at∣tire, burials, and such like, differ very little from the <HI>Virginians,</HI> onely for their Chronicles they make holes in the ground, as the others set vp great stones.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An answer to Obiections.</NOTE>Now I know the common question is, For all those miseries, where is the wealth they haue got, or the Gold or Siluer Mines? To such greedy vnworthy minds I say once againe: The Sea is better then the richest Mine knowne, and of all the fishing ships that went well prouided, there is no complaint of losse nor misery, but rather an admiration of wealth, profit, and health. As for the land were it neuer so good, in two yeeres so few of such small experience liuing with∣out supplies so well, and in health, it was an extraordinary blessing from God. But that with such small meanes they should subsist, and doe so much, to any vn∣derstanding judgement is a wonder. Notwithstanding, the vaine expectation of present gaine in some, ambition in others, that to be great would haue all else slaues, and the carelesnesse in prouiding supplies, hath caused those defaile∣ments in all those Plantations, and how euer some bad conditions will extoll the
<PB N="241" REF="133"/>
actions of any Nation but their owne: yet if we may giue credit to the <HI>Spaniards, Portugals,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> writings, they indured as many miseries, and yet not in twenty yeeres effected so much, nay scarce in fortie.</P>
<P>Thus you may see plainly the yeerely successe from <HI>New England</HI> by <HI>Ʋirgi∣nia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ordinary voyage to goe to <HI>Virginia</HI> or <HI>New-England.</HI></NOTE> which hath beene so costly to this Kingdome, and so deare to me, which ei∣ther to see perish, or but bleed; Pardon me though it passionate me beyond the bounds of modesty, to haue beene sufficiently able to fore-see their miseries, and had neither power nor meanes to preuent it. By that acquaintance I haue with them, I call them my children, for they haue beene my Wife, my Hawks, Hounds, my Cards, my Dice, and in totall, my best content, as indifferent to my heart, as my left hand to my right. And notwithstanding, all those miracles of disasters haue crossed both them and me, yet were there not an Englishman remaining, as God be thanked notwithstanding the massacre there are some thousands; I would yet begin againe with as small meanes as I did at first, not that I haue any secret encouragement (I protest) more then lamentable experience; for all their dis∣coueries I haue yet heard of, are but Pigs of my owne Sow, nor more strange to me, then to heare one tell me hee hath gone from <HI>Billingsgate</HI> and discouered <HI>Grauesend, Tilbury, Quinborow, Lee,</HI> and <HI>Margit,</HI> which to those did neuer heare of them, though they dwell in <HI>England,</HI> might bee made some rare secrets and great Countries vnknowne, except some few Relations of Master <HI>Dirmer.</HI> In <HI>England,</HI> some are held great trauellers that haue seene <HI>Ʋenice,</HI> and <HI>Rome, Ma∣drill, Toledo, Siuill, Algere, Prague,</HI> or <HI>Ragonsa, Constantinople,</HI> or <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and the Piramides of <HI>Egypt</HI>; that thinke it nothing to goe to <HI>Summer Iles,</HI> or <HI>Ʋirgi∣nia,</HI> which is as far as any of them; and I hope in time will proue a more profita∣ble and more laudable iourney: as for the danger, you see our Ladies and Gentle∣women account it nothing now to goe thither; and therefore I hope all good men will better apprehend it, and not suffer them to languish in despaire, whom God so wonderfully and oft hath preserued.</P>
<P>What here I haue writ by Relation, if it be not right I humbly intreat your pardons, but I haue not spared any diligence to learne the truth of them that haue beene actors, or sharers in those voyages; In some particulars they might deceiue mee, but in the substance they could not: for few could tell me any thing, except where they fished. But seeing all those haue liued there, doe confirme more then I haue writ, I doubt not but all those testimonies with these new begun examples of Plantation, will moue both Citie and Country, freely to aduenture with me more then promises.</P>
<P>But because some Fortune-tellers say, I am vnfortunate;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The obiections against me.</NOTE> had they spent their time as I haue done, they would rather beleeue in God then their calculations, and peraduenture haue giuen as bad an account of their actions, and therefore I intreat leaue to answer those obiecters, that thinke it strange, if this be true, I haue made no more vse of it, rest so long without imploiment, nor haue no more re∣ward nor preferment: To which I say;</P>
<P>I thinke it more strange they should tax me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My answer.</NOTE> before they haue tried as much as I haue, both by land and sea, as well in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Affrica,</HI> as <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> where my Commanders were actors or spectators, they alwaies so freely rewar∣ded me, I neuer needed bee importunate, or could I euer learne to beg: What there I got, I haue spent; yet in <HI>Virginia</HI> I staied, till I left fiue hundred behinde me better prouided then euer I was, from which blessed Virgin (ere I returned) sprung the fortunate habitation of <HI>Summer Iles.</HI></P>
<P>This Virgins Sister, now called <HI>New England,</HI> at my humble sute, by our most gracious Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> hath beene neere as chargeable to me and my friends: for all which, although I neuer got shilling but it cost mee a pound, yet I would thinke my selfe happy could I see their prosperities.</P>
<P>But if it yet trouble a multitude to proceed vpon these certainties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Considerations.</NOTE> what thinke you I vndertooke when nothing was knowne but that there was a vast land? I
<PB N="242" REF="134"/>
neuer had power and meanes to doe any thing, though more hath beene spent in formall delaies then would haue done the businesse, but in such a penurious and miserable manner, as if I had gone a begging to build an Vniuersitie: where had men beene as forward to aduenture their purses, and performe the conditions they promised mee, as to crop the fruits of my labours, thousands ere this had beene bettered by these designes. Thus betwixt the spur of desire and the bridle of reason, I am neere ridden to death in a ring of despaire; the reines are in your hands, therefore I intreat you ease me, and those that thinke I am ei∣ther idle or vnfortunate, may see the cause and know: vnlesse I did see better dea∣ling, I haue had warning enough not to be so forward againe at euery motion vp∣on their promises, vnlesse I intended nothing but to carie newes; for now they dare aduenture a ship, that when I went first would not aduenture a groat, so they may be at home againe by Michaelmas, which makes me remember and say with Master <HI>Hackluit</HI>; Oh incredulitie the wit of fooles, that slouingly doe spit at all things faire, a sluggards Cradle, a Cowards Castle, how easie it is to be an Infidell. But to the matter: By this all men may perceiue, the ordinary performance of this voyage in fiue or six moneths, the plentie of fish is most certainly approued; and it is certaine, from <HI>Cannada</HI> and <HI>New England,</HI> within these six yeeres hath come neere twenty thousand Beuer skinnes: Now had each of these ships transported but some small quantitie of the most increasing Beasts, Fowles, Fruits, Plants, and Seeds, as I proiected; by this time their increase might haue beene sufficient for more then one thousand men: But the desire of present gaine (in many) is so vio∣lent, and the endeuours of many vndertakers so negligent, euery one so regarding their priuate gaine, that it is hard to effect any publike good, and impossible to bring them into a body, rule, or order, vnlesse both honesty, as well as authoritie and money, assist experience. But your home-bred ingrossing Proiecters will at last finde, there is a great difference betwixt saying and doing, or those that thinks their directions can be as soone and easily performed, as they can conceit them; or that their conceits are the fittest things to bee put in practise, or their counte∣nances maintaine Plantations. But to conclude, the fishing will goe forward w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ther you plant it or no; whereby a Colony may be then transported with no great charge, that in short time might prouide such fraughts, to buy on vs there dwel∣ling, as I would hope no ship should goe or come emptie from <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The charge.</NOTE>The charge of this is onely Salt, Nets, Hookes, Lines, Kniues, Irish-rugges, course cloth, Beads, Glasse, and such trash, onely for fishing and trade with the Saluages, besides our owne necessarie prouisions, whole endeuours would quick∣ly defray all this charge, and the Saluages did intreat me to inhabit where I would. Now all those ships till these last two yeeres, haue beene fishing within a square of two or three leagues, and scarce any one yet will goe any further in the Port they fish in, where questionlesse fiue hundred may haue their fraught as well as else∣where, and be in the market ere others can haue the fish in their ships, because <HI>New Englands</HI> fishing begins in February, in <HI>Newfoundland</HI> not till the midst of May; the progression hereof tends much to the aduancement of <HI>Ʋirginia</HI> and <HI>Summer Iles,</HI> whose empty ships may take in their fraughts there, and would be also in time of need a good friend to the Inhabitants of <HI>Newfoundland.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of the westerne men.</NOTE>The returnes made by the Westerne men, are commonly diuided in three parts; one for the owner of the ship; another for the Master and his Company; the third for the victualers, which course being still permitted, will be no hinde∣rance to the Plantation as yet goe there neuer so many, but a meanes of transpor∣ting that yeerely for little or nothing, which otherwise wil cost many hundreds of pounds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gaines.</NOTE> If a ship can gaine twenty, thirty, fifty in the hundred; nay three hun∣dred for one hundred in seuen or ten moneths, as you see they haue done, spen∣ding twice so much time in comming and going as in staying there: were I there planted, seeing the variety of the fishings serue the most part of the yeere, and with a little labour we might make all the Salt we need vse, as is formerly said, and can

<HEAD>Master <HI>Dee</HI> his opinion for the building of ships.</HEAD>
<P>MAster <HI>Dee</HI> recordeth in his Brittish Monarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The effects of shipping.</NOTE> that King <HI>Edgar</HI> had a Nauy of foure thousand saile, with which he yeerely made his progresse, about this famous Monarchy of <HI>Great Britaine,</HI> largely declaring the benefit thereof; whereupon hee proiected to our most memorable Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the erecting of a Fleet of sixty Saile, he called a little Nauy Royall: imitating that admired <HI>Pericles</HI> Prince of <HI>Athens,</HI> that could neuer secure that tormented estate, vntill he was Lord and Captaine of the Sea. At this none need wonder, for who knowes not her Royall Maiestie during her life, by the in∣credible aduentures of her Royall Nauy, and valiant Souldiers and Sea-men, notwithstanding all treacheries at home, the protecting and defending <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and reconquering <HI>Ireland</HI>; yet all the world by Sea and Land both feared or loued, and admired good Queene <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> Both to maintaine and in∣crease that incomparable honour (God be thanked) to her incomparable Succes∣sor, our most Royall Lord and Soueraigne King <HI>Iames,</HI> this great Philosopher hath left this to his Maiestie and his Kingdomes consideration: that if the tenths of the earth be proper to God, it is also due by Sea. The Kings high waies are common to passe, but not to dig for Mines or any thing: So <HI>Englands</HI> Coasts are free to passe but not to fish, but by his Maiesties Prerogatiue.</P>
<P>His Maiesty of <HI>Spaine</HI> permits none to passe the Popes order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Popes order for the East and West Indies.</NOTE> for the East and West Indies but by his permission, or at their perils; if all that world be so iustly theirs, it is no iniustice for <HI>England</HI> to make as much vse of her owne shores as strangers doe, that pay to their owne Lords the tenth, and not to the owner of those liberties any thing to speake of, whose subiects may neither take nor sell any in their Teritories: which small tribute would maintaine this little Nauy Royall, and not cost his Maiesty a peny, and yet maintaine peace with all Forrainers, and allow them more courtesie then any Nation in the world affords to <HI>England.</HI> It were ashame to alleage, that <HI>Holla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> is more worthy to enioy our fishing as Lords thereof, because they haue more skill to handle it then we, as they can our wooll and vndressed Cloth, notwithstanding all their warres and troublesome dis∣orders.</P>
<P>To get money to build this Nauy, he saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to get mo∣ney to build this little Nauy.</NOTE> who would not spare the one hun∣dreth penny of his rents, and the fiue hundreth penny of his goods; each seruant that taketh forty shillings wages, foure pence; and euery forrainer of seuen yeeres of age foure pence, for seuen yeeres; not any of these but they will spend three times so much in pride, wantonnesse, or some superfluitie: And doe any men loue the securitie of their estates, that of themselues would not bee humble suters to his Maiesty to doe this of free will as a voluntary beneuolence, or but the one halfe of this (or some such other course as I haue prounded to diuers of the Com∣panies) free from any constraint, tax, lottery, or imposition; so it may be as ho∣nestly and truly imploied, as it is proiected, the poorest Mechanicke in this King-would gaine by it. Then you might build ships of any proportion and numbers you please, fiue times cheaper then you can doe here, and haue good merchandize for their fraught in this vnknowne Land, to the aduancement of Gods glory, his Church and Gospel, and the strengthning and releefe of a great part of Christen∣dome without hurt to any, to the terror of Pirats, the amazement of enemies, the assistance of friends, the securing Merchants, and so much increase of Nauigation, to make <HI>Englands</HI> trade and shipping as much as any Nations in the world, besides a hundred other benefits, to the generall good of all true subiects, &amp; would cause thousands yet vnborne to blesse the time, and all them that first put it in practise.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="135"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contention for <HI>New-Englands</HI> goods, not her good.</NOTE>Now lest it should be obscured as it hath beene to priuat ends, or so weakely vndertaken by our ouerweening incredulity, that strangers may possesse it whi∣lest we contend for <HI>New-Englands</HI> goods, but not <HI>Englands</HI> good; I haue presen∣ted it as I haue said, to the Prince and Nobility, the Gentry and Commonalty, ho∣ping at last it will moue the whole land to know it and consider of it; since I can finde them wood and halfe victuall, with the foresaid aduantages: were this Country planted, with what facility they may build and maintaine this little Na∣uy Royall, both with honour, profit and content, and inhabit as good a Coun∣try as any in the world within that paralell, which with my life and what I haue, I will endeuour to effect, if God please and you permit. But no man will goe from hence to haue lesse freedome there then here, nor aduenture all they haue to prepare the way for them will scarce thanke them for it; and it is too well knowne there haue beene so many vndertakers of Patents, and such sharing of them, as hath bred no lesse discouragement then wonder, to heare such great promises and so little performance; in the <HI>Interim,</HI> you see the French and Dutch already frequent it, and God forbid they in <HI>Virginia,</HI> or any of his Maiesties sub∣iects, should not haue as free liberty as they. To conclude, were it not for Master <HI>Cherley</HI> and a few priuate aduenturers with them, what haue we there for all these inducements?<NOTE PLACE="marg">The necessity of martiall power.</NOTE> As for them whom pride or couetousnesse lulleth asleepe in a Cradle of slothfull carelesnesse, would they but consider how all the great Monar∣chies of the earth haue beene brought to confusion, or but remember the late la∣mentable experiences of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and how many Cities, Townes and Pro∣uinces, in the faire rich Kingdoms of <HI>Hungaria, Transiluania, Wallachia</HI> &amp; <HI>Molda∣uia,</HI> and how many thousands of Princes, Earles, Barons, Knights, Merchants, and others, haue in one day lost goods, liues and honours, or sold for slaues like beasts in a market place, their wiues, children and seruants slaine, or wandring they knew not whither, dying or liuing in all extremities of extreme miseries and calamities, surely they would not onely doe this, but giue all they haue to enioy peace and liberty at home, or but aduenture their persons abroad; to preuent the conclusions of a conquering Foe, who commonly assaulteth and best preuaileth where he findeth wealth and plenty, most armed with ignorance and security.</P>
<P>Though the true condition of warre is onely to suppresse the proud and defend the innocent, as did that most generous Prince <HI>Sigismundus,</HI> Prince of those Countries, against them whom vnder the colour of iustice and piety, to main∣taine their superfluity of ambitious pride, thought all the world too little to maintaine their vice, and vndoe them, or keepe them from ability to doe any thing, that would not admire and adore their honours, fortunes, couetousnesse, falshood, bribery, cruelty, extortion, and ingratitude, which is worse then co∣wardize or ignorance, and all manner of vildnesse, cleane contrary to all honour, vertue, and noblenesse. Iohn Smith <HI>writ this with his owne hand.</HI></P>
<P>Here follow certaine notes and obseruations of Captaine <HI>Charles Whit∣bourne</HI> concerning <HI>New-found land,</HI> which although euery master trained vp in fishing, can make their proportions of necessaries according to their custome, yet it is not much amisse here to insert them, that euery one which desires the good of those actions know them also.

Boats with 22. men in a Summer doe vsually kill 25000. fish for euery Boat, which may amount to 200000. allowing 120. fishes to the 100. sometimes they haue taken aboue 35000. for a Boat, so that they load not onely their owne ship, but prouide great quantities for sacks, or other spare ships which come thither onely to buy the ouerplus: if such ships come not, they giue ouer taking any more, when sometimes there hath beene great abundance, because there is no fit houses to lay them in till another yeere, now most of those sacks goeth empty thither, which might as well transport mens prouision and cattle at an easie rate as nothing, either to <HI>New-England</HI> or <HI>New-found land,</HI> but either to transport them for nothing or pay any great matter for their liberty to fish, will hardly effect so much as freedome as yet; nor can this be put in practice as before I said, till there be a power there well planted and set∣led to entertaine and defend them, assist and releeue them as occasion shall require, otherwaies those small diuisions will effect little, but such miserable conclusions as both the French and we too long haue tried to our costs. Now commonly 200000. fish will load a ship of 100. tunnes in <HI>New-found land,</HI> but halfe so many will neere doe it in <HI>New-England,</HI> which carried to <HI>Toloune</HI> or <HI>Merselus,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here the custome is small, and the Kintall lesse then 90. English▪pounds weight, and the prise when least, 12. shillings the Kintall, which at that rate amounts to 1320. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> starling; and the ship may either there be discharged or imployed as hath beene said to refraught for <HI>England,</HI> so that the next yeere she may be ready to goe her fishing voyage againe, at a farre cheaper rate then before.</P>
<P>To this adde but 12. tuns of traine oile, which deliuered in <HI>New found land,</HI> is 10.<ABBR>l.</ABBR> the tun, makes 120. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> then it is hard if there be not 10000. of Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fish, which also sold there at 5. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the 1000. makes 50. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which brought to <HI>England,</HI> in somes places yeelds neere halfe so much more; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f at <HI>Mers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lus</HI> it be sold for 16. d. the Kentall, as commonly it is, and much dearer, it amounts to 1760. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and if the Boats follow the fishing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the 15. of October, they may take 80000. more, which with their traine in <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w-found land</HI> at 4. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the 1000. will amount to 320. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which added to 1320. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> with 120. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for Oile, and 10000. of Cor-fish 50. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the ouerplus at <HI>Merselus,</HI> which will be 440. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> make the totall 2250. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which diui∣ded in three parts according to their custome, the Victualer hath for the former particulars, amounting to 420. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 751. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> so all the charge defraied, hee gaines 331. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 11. <ABBR>s.</ABBR> then for the fraught of the ship there is 751. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and so much for the Master and his company, which comparing with the voiages hath beene made to <HI>New-England,</HI> you may easily finde which is the better though both bee good.

<HEAD>The present estate of <HI>New-Plimoth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AT <HI>New-Plimoth</HI> there is about 180 persons, some cattell and goats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The present e∣state of the plan∣tation at <HI>New-Plimoth.</HI> 1624.</NOTE> but many swine and poultry, 32 dwelling houses, whereof 7 were burnt the last winter, and the value of fiue hundred pounds in other goods; the Towne is impailed about halfe a mile compasse. In the towne vpon a high Mount they haue a Fort well built with wood, lome, and stone, where is planted their Ordnance: Also a faire Watch-tower, partly framed for the Senti∣nell, the place it seemes is healthfull, for in these last three yeeres, notwithstan∣ding their great want of most necessaries, there hath not one died of the first planters, they haue made a salt worke, and with that salt preserue the fish they take, and this yeare hath fraughted a ship of 180. tunnes. The Gouernour is one M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>William Bradford,</HI> their Captaine <HI>Miles Standish</HI>; a bred Souldier in <HI>Holland</HI>; the chiefe men for their assistance is Master <HI>Isaak Alderton,</HI> and diuers others as occasion serueth; their Preachers are Master <HI>William Bruster</HI> and Master <HI>Iohn Layford.</HI></P>
<P>The most of them liue together as one family or houshold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their order of gouernment.</NOTE> yet euery man fol∣loweth his trade and profession both by sea and land, and all for a generall stocke, out of which they haue all their maintenance, vntill there be a diuident betwixt the Planters and the Aduenturers. Those Planters are not seruants to the Ad∣uenturers here, but haue onely councells of directions from them, but no iniun∣ctions or command, and all the masters of families are partners in land or whatso∣euer, setting their labours against the stocke, till certaine yeeres be expired for the diuision: they haue young men and boies for their Apprentises and seruants, and some of them speciall families, as Ship-carpenters, Salt-makers, Fish-masters, yet as seruants vpon great wages. The Aduenturers which raised the stocke to begin and supply this Plantation were about 70. some Gentlemen, some Merchants, some handy-crafts men, some aduenturing great summes, some small, as their estates and affection serued. The generall stocke already imploied is about 7000. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> by reason of which charge and many crosses, many of them would aduenture no more, but others that knowes, so great a designe cannot bee effected without both charge, losse and crosses, are resolued to goe forward with it to their pow∣ers; which deserue no small commendations and encouragement. These dwell most about <HI>London,</HI> they are not a corporation, but knit together by a voluntary combination in a society without constraint or penalty, aiming to doe good &amp; to plant Religion; they haue a President &amp; Treasurer, euery yeere newly chosen by the most voices, who ordereth the affaires of their Courts and meetings, and with the assent of the most of them, vndertaketh all ordinary businesses, but in more weighty affaires, the assent of the whole Company is required. There hath beene a fishing this yeere vpon the Coast about 50. English ships: and by Cape <HI>Anne,</HI> there is a Plantation a beginning by the Dorchester men, which they hold of those of <HI>New-Plimoth,</HI> who also by them haue set vp a fishing worke; some talke there is some other pretended Plantations, all whose good proceedings the eternal God protect and preserue. And these haue beene the true proceedings and accidents in thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Plantations.</P>
<P>Now to make a particular relation of all the acts and orders in the Courts be∣longing vnto them, of the anihilating old Patents and procuring new; with the charge, paines and arguments, the reasons of such changes, all the treaties, con∣sultations, orations, and dissentions about the sharing and diuiding those large territories, confirming of Counsailers, electing all sorts of Officers, directions, Letters of aduice, and their answers, disputations about the Magazines and Im∣positions, su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers for Patents, positions for Freedomes, and confirmations with complaints of iniuries here, and also the mutinies, examinations, arraignements, executions, and the cause of the so oft reuolt of the Saluages at large, as many

would haue had, and it may be some doe expect it would make more quarrels then any of them would willingly answer, &amp; such a volume as would tire any wise man but to read the contents; for my owne part I rather feare the vnpartiall Reader wil thinke this rather more tedious then necessary: but he that would be a practiti∣oner in those affaires, I hope will allow them not only needfull but expedient: but how euer, if you please to beare with those errors I haue committed, if God please I liue, my care and paines shall endeuour to be thankfull: if I die, accept my good will: If any desire to be further satisfied, what defect is found in this, they shall finde supplied in me, that thus freely haue throwne my selfe with my mite into the Treasury of my Countries good, not doubting but God will stirre vp some noble spirits to consider and examine if worthy <HI>Columbus</HI> could giue the Spaniards any such certainties for his designe, when Queene <HI>Isabel</HI> of <HI>Spaine</HI> set him forth with 15. saile, and though I promise no Mines of gold, yet the warlike Hollanders let vs imitate but not hate, whose wealth and strength are good testimonies of their treasury gotten by fishing; and <HI>New-England</HI> hath yeelded already by generall computation one hundred thousand pounds at the least. Therefore honourable and worthy Country men, let not the meannesse of the word fish distaste you, for it will afford as good gold as the Mines of <HI>Guiana</HI> or <HI>Pot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssie,</HI> with lesse hazard and charge, and more certainty and facility. <HI>I.
