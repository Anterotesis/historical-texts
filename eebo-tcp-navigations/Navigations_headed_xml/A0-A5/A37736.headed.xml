<HEAD>THE
PREFACE
To the
READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Design of this small Tract
is to give an easie and clear
Account of these Parts, which are
now the Seats of Noble and Heroick
Actions; in which every Thing is so
well Contrived, and set in such good
Order and Method, as I believe will
give due Satisfaction to all such as are
Curious and Inquisitive after the Af∣fairs
of these Times.</P>
<P>All the Towns of Note are here
mentioned, and their Situation so well
designed, that they may very easily
and quickly be found in any good
Map; but especially by the help of
the Index, where their Longitude and
Latitude is also set down, (according
to <HI>F. de Wits</HI> Maps, the first Me∣ridian
<PB REF="3"/>
beginning at <HI>Tenneriff)</HI> which
is a great help towards the easie find∣ing
of a Place.</P>
<P>Those Towns that are of greatest
Note, and those that are Frontiers, and
probably may be places of Action, are
here very exactly and particularly
described; more largely and better
than are in the vulgar Geographies:
And such Descriptions as these are
both Pleasant and Profitable, and ve∣ry
much needed in these Times.</P>
<P>In short, Reader, here is scarce any
thing wanting that may be reasonably
expected from such a Volumne; and if
it should afford you any Profit, or
one or two hours Divertisement, is
all that I Desire; and shall think my
time not ill bestow'd if it shall deserve
your Perusal.</P>

Accurately Described.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of FLANDERS in General.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bounds.</NOTE>
or the <HI>Catholick Provinces,</HI>
commonly called by the
general Name of <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
(the Principal of
these Provinces) are bounded on the
East, with <HI>Germany;</HI> on the West, or
rather North-West, with the <HI>German
Ocean,</HI> which parts 'em from <HI>England;</HI>
on the North, with <HI>Holland,</HI> or the
<HI>Vnited Provinces;</HI> and on the South
and South-West, with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
The whole is of a kind of a Trian∣gular
From;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dimen∣sions.</NOTE> being in length from the
most Eastern parts of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> to
the most Western parts of <HI>Artois,</HI> about
192 Miles; and in breadth, from the
most North parts of <HI>Brabant,</HI> to the
most South parts of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> about
155 Miles; the whole Circumference
being scarce 600 Miles: containing,
according to <HI>Sellers</HI> Account, 7197000
of Acres.</P>
<P>The Principal Rivers in these Pro∣vinces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers.</NOTE>
are, 1. <HI>Maes,</HI> which (besides
its course in <HI>France)</HI> passes through
<HI>Namur, Liege</HI> and <HI>Gelderland,</HI> wash∣ing
the Towns of <HI>Charlemont, Dinant,
Namur, Liege, Maestricht, Ruremond,
Venlo, Grave</HI> and <HI>Dort,</HI> below which
it falls into the Sea. 2. <HI>Scheld,</HI> or
<HI>Escaut,</HI> passing through <HI>Cambray, Hai∣nault</HI>
and <HI>Flanders;</HI> washing the Towns
of <HI>Cambray, Valenciennes, Tournay; Ghent,</HI>
and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> a little below which it
falls into the Sea. 3. <HI>Lys,</HI> passing
through <HI>Artois</HI> and <HI>Flanders;</HI> and wash∣ing
the Towns of <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Courtray,</HI> and
at <HI>Ghent</HI> falls into the River <HI>Scheld.</HI>
Those of less Note shall be spoken of
afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
This is but a small spot of Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches &amp; Strength.</NOTE>
but exceeding populous, full of excel∣lent
Towns and Villages, and most
plentifully endowed with all things
necessary either for Pleasure or Profit.
So very rich, that at once the King of
<HI>Spain</HI>'s Revenues from thence (when
he had all) was greater than any
Prince in Christendom, the King of
<HI>France</HI> excepted; but at present the
charge of keeping is much greater
than the Revenues. The Strength of
these parts are very great, and were it
not for the vast increase of the French
Power, and the decay of the Spanish,
it would be thought much greater:
But for a long time the Spaniards
have not been able to keep those they
have still, without great help from
others.</P>
<P>The Traffick in these parts have
been always very great;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Traffick▪</NOTE> but now no∣thing
so much as formerly, by reason
of the prodigious increase of the <HI>Vni∣ted
Provinces</HI> in these late years. It
chiefly consists of several sorts of
Manufactures, as rich Tapestries, fine
Camlets, Serges, coloured Says, Mock-Velvets,
great Quantities of fine Lin∣nen,
Damasks, Cambricks, Taffaties,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
and strip'd Stuffs for Beds, which sell
well in many Countries; all sorts of
Ribbons, Bastard Sattins, and many
other things of this Nature, made at
the Cities of <HI>Mons, Gaunt, Brusselles,
Ypres, Lille, Bruges, Valenciennes, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of these parts con∣sist
of Flemmings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhahi∣tants.</NOTE> Walloons, Spaniards,
with some intermixture (more espe∣cially
at present) of French, Dutch,
and English. The Religion among
them may be said to be various, accor∣ding
to their several Nations; but
howsoever that of the Roman Church
is only publickly allowed. The Pro∣testants
(which are of no small Num∣ber
in many of the chief Cities) are ra∣ther
suffered out of Policy. The Arch∣bishopricks
and Bishopricks are all Ro∣man
Catholick.</P>
<P>The Languages most generally used
in these parts are the Walloon and
Flemmish;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Langua∣ges.</NOTE> the Walloon is a corrupt
French, spoken in <HI>Artois, Hainault,
Namur, Luxemburg, French Flanders,</HI>
some of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and the Bishoprick
of <HI>Liege.</HI> The Flemmish or Low-Dutch,
is a Dialect of the German,
spoken in the <HI>Marquisate, Mechlin,</HI> the
rest of <HI>Brabant, Flanders,</HI> and the Bi∣shoprick
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
of <HI>Liege.</HI> The Spanish is al∣so
much in use among the King of
<HI>Spain</HI>'s Subjects, and the French a∣mong
the better sort. English and
Latin is here well understood by ma∣ny.</P>
<P>In these Provinces are two Archbi∣shopricks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks</NOTE>
<HI>viz. Cambray</HI> and <HI>Mechlin;</HI>
and eleven Bishopricks, <HI>viz. Antwerp,
Boisleduc, Bruges, Ghent, Ruremond</HI> and
<HI>Ypres,</HI> under <HI>Mechlin; Namur, Arras,
St. Omers,</HI> and <HI>Tournay,</HI> under <HI>Cambray;</HI>
and <HI>Liege</HI> under <HI>Cologne</HI> in <HI>Germany.</HI>
Here are also 155 Cities or Walled
Towns, (besides those in <HI>Cambray</HI> and
part of <HI>Gelderland)</HI> and 6867 Villa∣ges,
besides the Castles, Forts, and
Noble Mens Houses, which are al∣most
innumerable. The chief City of
the whole is <HI>Antwerp;</HI> but <HI>Brussels</HI> be∣ing
the Seat of the Spanish Governor,
and the Heart of the Country, I shall
reckon the distances from that. The
chief City of the French is <HI>Mons;</HI> of
the Hollanders, is <HI>Boisleduc,</HI> or <HI>Mae∣stricht;</HI>
and of the Bishop of <HI>Liege,
Liege.</HI></P>
<P>The Provinces are in Number 10;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provin∣ces.</NOTE>

to these may be added that part
of <HI>Gelderland</HI> that is under the Spani∣ards,
and the Dutchy of <HI>Cambray.</HI> Of
these, <HI>Flanders</HI> borders on the Sea; <HI>Bra∣bant,</HI>

Luxemburg,</HI> on <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Ger∣many:

<HI>Mechlin</HI> are Midland Provinces.</P>
<P>The Government of these Provin∣ces
should be all under the Spaniards;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Govern∣ment.</NOTE>
but at present they have only <HI>Namur,</HI>
the <HI>Marquisate,</HI> nigh three quarters of

this Province, commodiously seated
on the Banks of the Rivers <HI>Scheld</HI> and
<HI>Leye,</HI> which run through it, and di∣vide
it into 26 Islands which are joy∣ned
together with 98 Bridges. It is
accounted one of the largest Cities in
the Low-Countrys, being seven miles
in Compass within the Walls, but now
rather decays than encreases. It is well
Walled and Trenched about; and the
private Buildings are for the most part
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
fair and stately, and the Streets hand∣some
and clean kept. It has seven
Churches, and 55 Religious Houses.
The Cathedral is a most stately Stru∣cture;
and the Tower <HI>Bellefort</HI> is a∣bove
400 Steps high. The Castle,
which is the Princes Palace, contains
three hundred Chambers. The Cit∣tadel
consists of four Bastions, which
are but little, and look on one side
upon the City; and on the other to∣wards
the Fields; and tho' this For∣tress
be of a regular form, yet it is
not so convenient as many others in
these parts. The Trade of this place
consists (besides Corn) in Cloths,
Stuffs and Silks, of which there are so
great quantity made, that among the

make one third.</P>

<P><HI>BRuges</HI> or <HI>Brugge,</HI> the Second City

in a large Plain, about Eight miles
from Sea, and the Walls on the inside
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
are somewhat above four miles in
Compass; the City being of a round
form, and well Walled and Fortified
with Works of Earth and deep Ditches.
The River <HI>Rey</HI> runs through it with a
muddy and heavy stream. The City
it self is exceeding neat, tolerably popu∣lous,
and very well built, many of
the Houses being four or five, and
some six Stories high. It is one of
the most considerable places that the
Spaniards have left; and notwith∣standing
it comes vastly short of its
former Trade, it may well challenge
place among the Cities of the Second
rate in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Market place has
a Commodious and Pleasant Situation,
being the Centre where six of the
principal Streets, running from as ma∣ny
of the chief Gates of the City, are
terminated.</P>
<P>Here are Seven Parish Churches,
(that of St. <HI>Johns</HI> is Cathedral) 60
Religious Houses, and three Colleges

situated upon the River <HI>Scharpe,</HI> and
is of considerable Strength, and has a
fine Magazine very well furnished. It
is likewise considerable for its extent,
ancient Buildings, <HI>September</HI> Fair, and
Traffick upon the <HI>Scheld;</HI> but more
especially for being an University,
and a Seminary for the English Roman
Catholicks. The Fort stands about a
Cannon-shot below the Town upon
the <HI>Scharpe,</HI> and judged by its situa∣tion
among Marshes, by means of its
Sluces, whereby it can drown all the
Country about, to be impregnable.
The chief Trade of this Place consists
in fine Woolen-Camlets, sent into
many Parts. It stands 56 miles almost

the Old Town, there have been,
since it came into the Hands of the
French, great Works drawn, which
augment the Town above one half.
There is a New Trench cut for a
Mile together through the Splinter-Sands,
which will, upon the Head of
the Tide, receive 150 Vessels of 70
Guns apiece; and on the West-side of
this Harbour is raised a vast pil'd and
plank'd Work, to intercept and lodge
the Sands. It is a Place of very great
Strength, but much added by the late
Fortifications, which are very large,
and the Bastion towards the North is
most stately. It is well built and po∣pulous,
and particularly commended
for the Neatness and Regularity of
the Streets. Here is an English Nun∣nery,
and <HI>Franciscans</HI> have a Cloyster
for Persons of both Sexes. At the

among divers Channels; but is chiefly
environed almost on all sides by two

Sea enters into the Land, and grows
so high when at full Tide, that the
Town seems rather to be buried, than
situated in the Sea. It has been more∣over
so exactly and regularly fortifi∣ed,
that it is taken to be one of the
strongest Towns in the <HI>Low-Countries;</HI>
having also a safe and capacious Har∣bour,
(which it is said can never be
blocked up) well defended, and deep
enough to receive Ships of the great∣est

handsom and uniform; the Streets be∣ing
regular, well pav'd, exactly level
and strait; this Regularity is to be at∣tributed
to its being built altogether.
