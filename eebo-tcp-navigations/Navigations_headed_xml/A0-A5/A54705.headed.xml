<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF <HI>TANGIER:</HI> In A LETTER To His GRACE, The Lord Chancellor of <HI>IRELAND, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please Your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Eing <HI>conscious</HI> to my self of my own ve∣ry great incapacity to render such an Account as may be delightful
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>and satisfactory; I am ashamed so unprofitably to divert you from better imployments, and so palpably to discover my own weakness in the follow∣ing Description of the City of <HI>Tangier,</HI> and the Territory thereunto belonging: where∣in howsoever I had rather be∣wray my folly in this abrupt Narration, than administer an occasion to be suspected in my readiness to obey your Com∣mands; and therefore I presume to present to your Grace these hasty Notes, resolving to deal truly and impartially, ac∣cording to what I have seen and observed, and what hath been related to me by credible persons.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> the 12 of <HI>June</HI> last, early in the morning, we entred the Passage into the <HI>Streights,</HI> between <HI>Cape Spar∣tel</HI> and <HI>Cape Trafalgar,</HI> in one of His Majesties Frigots: from the <HI>Cape</HI> to <HI>Tangier,</HI> (the wind blowing fresh from the Land) a most odoriferous smell, like to the Fume of Cedar or Ju∣niper, entertain'd us; which I conceive to be a mixture of pleasant sents arising from the variety of sweet Trees and Herbs growing there wild: the Coast rocky, rugged, and full of Hills, yet very safe for Ships, very green with Grass and Herbs, and full of Trees. When we came into the Bay
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>of <HI>Tangier,</HI> there fell a most ve∣hement storm of rain, which continued an hour, and (as it is said) was more than was seen at that time of the year in any mans memory. Being sa∣luted with a thousand shots of great Guns from the Mole, the Castle, the Forts, and the Ships riding in the Bay, we landed, where we were met by the Mayor and Corporation in their Gowns, and conducted through a Guard of Souldiers from thence to the Castle.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Tangier</HI> is in the Latitude of 35 <HI>deg.</HI> 35 <HI>min.</HI> situated very pleasantly about the middle way between the Entrance and the Mouth of
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>the <HI>Streights,</HI> in a large Bay like a Semi-Circle, in plain sight of the Coast of <HI>Spain,</HI> being less than six Leagues di∣stant from it: the weather na∣turally very hot and scalding, but so temper'd with Friscoes and Breezes both from Land and Sea, that the Air is rendred very tolerable; the Sky alway bright and serene, no Rain (nor hardly a Cloud) being seen there for three parts of the year: the <HI>Levant</HI>-wind, (which blows very often and very strong, especially during the months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August</HI>) as it makes the weather more cool, so, besides its unkindness to Ships, it is not very agree∣able
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>to Health; many people, especially such as are sickly, being then faint, and more dis-composed. The City seems to have been one of the great∣est in the World, which is ap∣parent by the old Walls and Ruines, extending S. E. about two miles, as far as old <HI>Tan∣gier,</HI> (where stands a heap of ruined Buildings, a pleasant River, wonderfully stored with several sorts of good Fish run∣ning near it, and a large Stone-Bridge over it, but now bro∣ken) and stretching N. W. near three miles, and beyond <HI>Teveot</HI>-Hill, (so called from that Renowned Person the Earl of <HI>Teveot,</HI> who there was
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>cut off the by <HI>Moors</HI>) and a pret∣ty Brook, called <HI>Jews-River,</HI> running about the middle way. I dare not take upon me the part of an Historian, or go about to give an exact Ac∣count of the Annals of this Place; but only in a few words to deduce the Summary History of its several Owners, till it came into the Hands of His Sacred Majesty, (whom God long preserve over us, and that City under Him.)</P>
<P><HI>Tangier,</HI> or <HI>Tingis,</HI> was first built (as some say) by those fugitive <HI>Canaanites,</HI> who in the Fields adjoining erected Pil∣lars, with this Inscription in the <HI>Phoenician</HI> Language, import∣ing
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>in <HI>English, We flee from the face of the Son of</HI> Nave, <HI>the great Robber:</HI> Or, as others, by <HI>Tinga,</HI> Wife of <HI>Antaeus,</HI> slain by <HI>Hercules.</HI> I shall not mention what <HI>Leo Africanus</HI> saith of it, because himself al∣lows it fabulous. It was a City of great note and esteem, when the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> con∣tended with the <HI>Romans,</HI> and gave Name to all the adjacent Country, but is said to have been buried by <HI>Caesar</HI> in the Ruines of <HI>Juba</HI> its King; but by <HI>Claudius</HI> (who first made <HI>Mauritania Tingitana</HI> a Roman Province) to have been resto∣red, and made a Colony, called <HI>Traducta Julia:</HI> From thence
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>it continued the Metropolis of <HI>Mauritania,</HI> until <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great laid it to the Diocess of <HI>Spain;</HI> in which condition it continued during some time of the Empire, until about the year 642. <HI>Suintilla</HI> King of the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> added it to his Dominions. So that they seem to err, who report, this City, and its dependant Coun∣try, to have been possessed by the <HI>Vandals,</HI> invited into <HI>Afri∣ca</HI> by <HI>Boniface,</HI> in the Empire of <HI>Valentinian</HI> the third. It continued subject to the <HI>Goths,</HI> longer than <HI>Spain</HI> did: for though <HI>Osman,</HI> the third <HI>Caliph</HI> Successor of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> con∣quered the rest of <HI>Barbavy;</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>yet <HI>Tingitana</HI> was still held by the <HI>Goths,</HI> and afforded retreat and shelter to the Sons of <HI>Viti∣za,</HI> the true Heirs, during the Usurpation of <HI>Roderic</HI> the last King, and also some years after his slaughter, and the subver∣sion of the <HI>Gothish</HI> Kingdom in <HI>Spain,</HI> by <HI>Musa</HI> and <HI>Tariffe,</HI> Lieutenants to <HI>Ʋlidor Ʋlit,</HI> the <HI>Saracenical Caliph.</HI> The <HI>Moors,</HI> when they held this Town, had here a Publick School or University, where their Youth were taught Let∣ters; as also an Hospital libe∣rally endowed by <HI>Joseph a Ben Teifin,</HI> the second of the <HI>Al∣mora Vides,</HI> who founded <HI>Mo∣rocco,</HI> conquered <HI>Fez,</HI> and sub∣dued
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>all the <HI>Moorish Roytelets</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> adding this to his large Dominion. Under his Successors of the three Races, (the <HI>Almoravides,</HI> the <HI>Almo∣hades,</HI> and lastly the <HI>Merines</HI>) <HI>Tangier</HI> was their chief Port for <HI>Spain;</HI> for in this Bay, and that of <HI>Alcazzer,</HI> not far from the Point, did <HI>Alboacen</HI> embarque his Army for <HI>Spain,</HI> confisting of 400000 Foot, and 70000 Horse, who were discomfited by the Christians at <HI>Salado</HI> near <HI>Tariffa:</HI> by which blow, the power of the <HI>Miramemolins</HI> was so broken, that their Em∣pire declined very fast both in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> their civil dissentions also hastning their
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>downfal; in which decay of the <HI>Merin</HI> Family, <HI>Tangier</HI> was deserted by the <HI>Moors,</HI> as most of this Coast was, on the ap∣proach of <HI>Alphonso</HI> the fifth, King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who took possession of it <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1472. whose Successors held it with continual Wars, and various Successes with the <HI>Xerisses,</HI> un∣til the year 1669. when it was delivered to that excellent and much-lamented General, the <HI>Earl of Sandwich,</HI> for the use of <HI>CHARLES the Second,</HI> King of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> But whoso∣ever desires a more particular and satisfactory account of these things, may consult <HI>He∣rodotus</HI> in <HI>Vita Cambysis, Proco∣pius,
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>Enagrius, Josephus,</HI> and <HI>Bochartus</HI> his <HI>Phaleg, Plutarch</HI>'s <HI>Sertorius, &amp;c.</HI> the Histories of <HI>Spain,</HI> written by <HI>Mariana</HI> or <HI>Turquet;</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> by <HI>Osorius,</HI> &amp;c. of <HI>Africa,</HI> by <HI>Leo,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>It is certainly a very sweet and well-chosen place, at the foot of a very great Hill, on which the Castle standeth, on a Declivity, but yet insensible, of an irregular square, and fen∣ced with a high, thin, old∣fashioned Wall, (much like to that of <HI>Droghedah</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI>) having only two Gates, one to∣ward the Country, called <HI>Port-Catharina,</HI> a wonderful strong, and well-contrived Entrance; the other to the Sea, called the
<PB N="14" REF="9"/><HI>Water-Gate.</HI> The Streets are extreamly narrow, (which is absolutely necessary in all pla∣ces where the Sun is so much Vertical) which makes the Town seem much smaller, and less considerable than it is: but were they extended at the rate of the new Streets in and about <HI>London,</HI> it would take up a great deal of Ground, and appear a very large Town. The Houses are low, and ge∣nerally little, with <HI>Spanish</HI> Roofs, almost flat, (which is the cause that it makes the less shew) the Walls generally of Stone and Mudd, the cover∣ing crooked Tiles, the In side and Cielings of Slit Deal, or
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>Pine: There are many of the Officers and principal Towns∣men, who have fine, large, com∣modious, and well-furnished Houses and Gardens; and in∣deed the Houses are for the most part very pretty and con∣venient, hardly any without a little Garden, but extreamly beautiful and delighting, full of sweet Herbs, and pleasant Trees, especially Vines, which running up upon Pillars made of Stone, and <HI>Espaliers</HI> made of great Reeds, (which for that purpose they commonly Nurse in a corner of the Gar∣den, and annually cut down for that use) all their Walks, and Back-sides, and Spare∣places,
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>are covered and shaded with Vines, mightily loaden with excellent Grapes, of di∣vers sorts, sizes, and shapes, and some very early ripe. The Air, taking one time with ano∣ther, exceeding temperate, not so sultry as many times of the day in <HI>Ireland,</HI> nor so sharp as many of the nights there. It is observed, that the Inhabi∣tants here (as of the adjacent Country) are much subject to sore eyes, which I am apt to impute not to any innate qua∣lity of the Air, but to the dry∣ness and continual brightness of it. New-comers are wel∣comed constantly with strange Blisters and Pimples, like to
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>the Small-Pox, which is ge∣nerally attributed to the biting of <HI>Muskitoes,</HI> (which are just the Gnats in some parts of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> but a little more pert) and <HI>Chinches,</HI> (which much re∣semble <HI>Ticks,</HI> but that they leave so intolerable a stink when they are killed) but I rather think it to proceed from an Ebullition of the Blood, upon change of the Air, it hap∣pening most severely to such as drink much water at their first coming. There can be no place in the World better accommodated with Water, and the best that can be tasted; no Garden in the Town (at least on the North-West-side)
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>but hath a Well, and some many; and in the Market-Place is a handsom large Con∣duit, with a very fair Cistern, and a Cock continually run∣ning on each side: the Water is brought to the Town in most admirable and costly Aque∣ducts, made formerly by the Romans, and said to come from the Foot of <HI>Mount-Atlas;</HI> but where the Passages are, no man can discover, till you come within two hundred paces of the Lines, and there they may be seen, curiously made of Brick and Stone; and at eve∣ry twenty yards, or there∣about, a little Well, into which the Gravel, Mudd, or any
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>other Filth doth fall, and when they are filled, it is easie to empty and cleanse them. I have often wondred that the <HI>Moors</HI> (such inveterate Ene∣mies and Haters of all <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI> especially the <HI>Tangerines</HI>) should forbear cutting and spoiling the Aqueducts, or poysoning the Water; till I understood, that it is a point of their Law and Religion, not to destroy any thing that is made for the natural and ne∣cessary use of Mankind, (which is the cause that they so curse and exclaim on the <HI>Christian-Dogs,</HI> when a Party hath been sometime sent out of this Ga∣rison to burn their Corn.) The
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>Land about the Town is very rich and pleasant, abundantly luxuriant in the production of fine Flowers, (as <HI>Narcissus, Crocus, Iris, &amp;c.</HI>) and sweet smelling Plants, which with so much care and cost are nou∣rished and reared in the Gar∣dens of <HI>Europe;</HI> so that the Hay made there by the Gari∣son, is only a wither'd Nose∣gay of Rosemary, Thyme, Marjoram, Pennyroyal, and other sweet-smelling Herbs. In the Gardens are very good Pease, Beans, Artichokes, (As∣paragus growing wild in the Fields) Strawberries, Lettice, Purslane, Cucumbers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but Melons, so plentiful, so various
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>in the shape and kind, and so delicious, that it cannot be de∣scribed to understanding and belief. The common Fruits of this Place are Apricocks and Peaches, (which I cannot say are so good as in <HI>England,</HI> and I conceive the cause to be, that they are Wildings, and not mended by Inoculation) Figgs, which bear twice a year, and Mulberries, (much better) O∣ranges, Lemons, Limes, Ci∣trons, Pomegranats, Plumbs, some Cherries, but not worth eating, some Pears and Apples, but very scurvy, (which pro∣bably ariseth from the cause before hinted, that no pains are taken in Grafting;) but the
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>Grapes are certainly not to be parallel'd in any place of the World. They ordinarily use Calabashas, a kind of a long Pompion, and Simnels, in stead of Cabbage and Turnips, but they are no way comparable to either of them. The Fields about the Town were hereto∣fore much more delightful, when they stood full of O∣range-Trees, Lemons, Olives, Pomegranats, Figgs and Mul∣berries; but some time since, there being no timely provisi∣on made for Firing, the Soul∣diers were necessitated to cut them down, and burn them, for want of other Fewel. There is a very great and curious
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>Wood near the Town, green all the year, which I daily saw out of my Chamber-window; and though I did not hold it convenient to take a nearer survey of it, I was told, by such as in time of Peace have been in it, that it is a <HI>ravish∣ing</HI> Wilderness of Oranges, Lemons, Figgs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Scarlet-Oak, and Cork-Trees; and in stead of Bryars and Thorns, <HI>thickned</HI> with Damask Roses, Groves of Myrtle, Jasemine, and Bushes of Rosemary.</P>
<P>The Hay-Harvest useth to be about the middle of <HI>May,</HI> and is compleatly made in two days. Barley and Wheat are cut down in <HI>June;</HI> the Grain
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>trodden out by Oxen, laid up in Caves, and the Straw kept for Food for Horses and Cat∣tle: And in the Month of <HI>August,</HI> the Stubble through the whole Country is set on fire, partly to destroy the Ver∣mine, which otherwise would become insupportable, and partly to inrich the Ground, there being no other manure used. The Seasons seem to be opposite to those in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and quite in∣verted: for whereas there from <HI>May</HI> to <HI>All-Hallontide,</HI> the Ground is green, and pleasant, and covered with Grass, and from thence to <HI>April</HI> dry, white and withered; on the contrary,
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>all the Verdure and Sweetness in <HI>Barbary,</HI> rank Grass, and variety of Flowers and Herbs, is from <HI>November</HI> to <HI>April;</HI> but from thence to <HI>November,</HI> the Ground dry, white, wither'd, and burnt with the Sun; this I mean of the Country, but the Gardens are perpetually green, and produce two Crops in a year of almost all Garden stuff and Sallads: nay, the Cows, Asses, and Horses, (directly contrary to the usage of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>) do live all the Summer upon Hay, and chopt Barley∣straw, (which is brought in <HI>Barca-luengos</HI> from <HI>Spain</HI>) and upon Grass in the Winter. If a Peace were made with the
<PB N="26" REF="15"/><HI>Moors,</HI> all manner of Fresh Provisions would be as good as in <HI>England,</HI> and as plentiful and cheap as in <HI>Ireland:</HI> the Beef and Mutton is not so ge∣nerally fat, but as sweet and juicy as in any other place: Hens, Chickens, Capons, Geese and Turkies, are extreamly plentiful, and very good; the Pigeons very large, and very fat; but the Ducks are certainly the best in the World: for being kept from Puddles and dirty feeding, and fatned with Oatmeal and Pease, the Flesh of them is quite changed in colour and taste. I have eaten here Plover, Curlew, and Bu∣stard, and very good; the Par∣tridge,
<PB N="27" REF="15"/>though much larger, doth not please me so well as those of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> but here are a sort of Birds about the bigness of a Phea∣sant, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call them, <HI>Pesones de Campo,</HI> which I must commend above all the Fowl that ever I tasted. In the mean time, no place under Heaven, perhaps, is better furnished with excellent kinds of Fish, and great plenty; here are (beside Soles, Gurnets, Mul∣lets, Turbets, Lobsters, Eels, Shrimps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in common with <HI>England</HI>) Cod-fish, Bonito's, Old-women, Porgo's, Salmo∣netto's, Rock-fish, Star-fish, and many other, for which they
<PB N="28" REF="16"/>have no name. The Castle of <HI>Tangier</HI> is situated most secure∣ly and most delightfully upon a very high Hill, overlooking the Town, Country, and Har∣bour; Fortified, beside its Foundation, on inaccessible Rocks, by four the most regu∣lar, high, and well-built Ba∣stions that can any where be seen; several excellent, and inexhaustible Wells within it; and is, in a word, to all appea∣rance, a place impregnable; all the Store-houses of Ammu∣nition and Provision, many Houses, Streets and Gardens contained within it, and very near the third part of as much Ground as is in the whole City,
<PB N="29" REF="16"/>being divided from it by a Wall that reacheth to the Sea. The Upper-Castle, or the Go∣vernours House, is very noble, large and commodious, and owes its beauty and conveni∣ences to the care and genero∣sity of that excellent Person, the Earl of <HI>Middleton,</HI> late Go∣vernour, and doth afford a most incomparable Prospect, all Ships that pass to or from the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> sailing un∣der the sight of the Windows: out of <HI>Foraging-Port,</HI> the Gate that looks to the Sea, an even, plain, and very pleasant Walk leads to <HI>Charles Fort,</HI> a strong and well fortified Place, and Commanded by Captain
<PB N="30" REF="17"/><HI>Charles Daniel,</HI> whose Inge∣nuity I must not forget, that hath so curiously beautified the Fort, without impairing the Strength, having on one side made a most delightful Walk between the Wall and the Graft, about twelve foot wide, and near two hundred yards long, curiously Gravelled, and covered close with Vines, which run up upon Pillars, and afford a cool shade on the hot∣test day. On another side he hath his Melon-Gardens, and not far from thence his Garden for Flowers and Herbs; so that <HI>Charles Fort,</HI> which is the great terrour to the <HI>Moors,</HI> and which they dare not come near, is
<PB N="31" REF="17"/>the greatest delight of the In∣habitants of <HI>Tangier,</HI> and con∣tinually visited like <HI>Spring-Garden.</HI> There is another House of Pleasure within the Lines, which they call by the name of <HI>White-Hall,</HI> a place where the Ladies, the Officers, and the better sort of people, do refresh and divert them∣selves with Wine, Fruits, and a very pretty Bowling-Bare. The <HI>Mole</HI> is in its design the greatest and most noble Un∣dertaking in the World, (all other Moles, as at <HI>Genoa, Ma∣laga, Algier, &amp;c.</HI> not deser∣ving more than the name of a Key, in comparison of it) it is a very pleasant thing to look
<PB N="32" REF="18"/>on; and if it may be finished according to His Majesties purpose, who hath spared no cost upon it, it will not only secure the Bay and Ships in it, but in time render <HI>Tangier</HI> ve∣ry considerable and advanta∣geous to His Majesty and His Kingdoms: It is now near four hundred and seventy yards long, and thirty yards broad, several pretty Houses upon it, and many Families; on the in∣ner side twenty four Arched Cellars, and before them a cu∣rious Walk, with Pillars for the Mooring of Ships. Upon the Mole are a vast number of great Guns, which are al∣most continually kept warm,
<PB N="33" REF="18"/>during fair weather, in giving and paying Salutes to Ships which come in and out: for the most part of the year there are imploy'd in this work three hundred Men, and several Carts with good Teames of Horses continually going with Stone and other Materials be∣tween the Mole and <HI>Whitby;</HI> which is a little English Ham∣let, planted by that industrious and ingenious Gentleman Sir <HI>Hugh Cholmely,</HI> where are about twenty Families, beside at least an hundred Labourers and Souldiers lodge there eve∣ry night, and are sufficiently defended by Guns and Forts from any Attaque of the <HI>Moors.</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="19"/>It is very pleasant to see how busie every man is there in his several Trade; the Smiths, Carpenters, Sawyers, Coopers, Wheelwrights, Carters, Ma∣sons, Miners, Drill-men, Quar∣ry-men, and Stone-cutters, making a pretty confused Mu∣sick, and very pleasant to such as do not pay for it. There were in <HI>Tangier,</HI> when the <HI>Portugueses</HI> left it, seventeen Churches and Chappels; but now there are only two; one whereof, with a large scope of Ground, a Convent, and Lodg∣ings for the Church-men, and very commodious Out-houses and Gardens, is left to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Inhabitants, and is
<PB N="35" REF="19"/>indeed a fine Church, delicate∣ly beautified all round it with neat and costly Altars: the other, a pretty plain Chappel, formerly dedicated to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and now to <HI>Charles</HI> the Martyr, is the Protestant Church, and very well filled on <HI>Sundays.</HI> There is also an Hospital for sick and wounded Souldiers, very well provided for; and an Exhibition of 200 <HI>l. per ann.</HI> for maintaining and breeding the Orphan-Children of Soul∣diers or Towns-men.</P>
<P><HI>Tangier,</HI> and the Territory belonging to it, is at the pre∣sent governed by the Earl of <HI>Insiquin,</HI> a Person of very great Abilities, and immoveable
<PB N="36" REF="20"/>Loyalty. In whose time though it unluckily fell out, that a party of men were cut off by the <HI>Moors,</HI> yet it ought to be no Impeachment of his Prudence and Conduct. For the Garison being extreamly scarce of Provisions, the Stores exhausted, and nothing to be had from <HI>Portugal</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> (whither he sent Vessels with ready money to buy Meat, but could get none) and the Cor∣poration by a Remonstrance laying before him how ill the Stores were furnished both in quantity and quality, he called a Council of War, by whom he was with one consent advi∣sed and intreated to send a
<PB N="37" REF="20"/>Party out to fetch in a Prey of Cattle; and accordingly on the 19th of <HI>September</HI> he sent out a Party of 500 men, under the Command of Sir <HI>Palmes Fairborn,</HI> (being the rather in∣duced to it by the encourage∣ment of <HI>James Hamet,</HI> a Rene∣gado-<HI>Moor,</HI> recommended to the Governour as a fit person to be a Spy) the Forlorn con∣sisting of 100 Souldiers, and about 35 Voluntiers, marched two miles beyond the Body, and were suddenly encompas∣sed by a great Party of Horse, who lay in Ambush, and all slain, except Captain <HI>Alexander Mac Kenny,</HI> who commanded 15 Horse-men; and being dis∣mounted,
<PB N="38" REF="21"/>lay among the dead bodies, till he found an oppor∣tunity to steal into the adjoin∣ing Wood, where he lay that night, and attempting to re∣turn to the Garison next day, he was met by the <HI>Moors,</HI> and carried prisoner to <HI>Tetuan:</HI> He gave an account by Letter, that sitting in a Tree, he saw the <HI>Moors</HI> gather 80 bodies from among the dead, of such as were most considerable among them, and having laid them in a Funeral-Pile, and performed their accustomed ceremony in howling and lamenting, burnt them, leaving a great number of the ordinary sort mingled among the dead bodies of our
<PB N="39" REF="21"/>men: In the mean time the main Body, being divided into two parties, one commanded by Sir <HI>Palmes Fairborn,</HI> the other by Captain <HI>James Leslie,</HI> made a safe and honourable Retreat, though furiously attacqued on all sides by a great number of Horse and Foot, performing their parts even to admiration. This action was a very great terrour to the <HI>Moors,</HI> who ne∣ver lost so many men, since the English possessed the Place; and thereby were feelingly convinced, that the <HI>Christians</HI> would fight for their Lives, which before they would not seem to allow, all the former Losses having happened upon
<PB N="40" REF="22"/>treacherous surprises, and at such times when our men were not provided for a fight. The Garrison consisteth of 1440 Foot, and 30 Horse, and is certainly a Body of as brave, bold, well-trained men, as are to be seen any where in the World; they are paid 6 <HI>d. per diem</HI> in meat, and 3 <HI>d.</HI> in mo∣ney. The Town is for the most part peopled with His Majesties Subjects, who live neatly and pleasantly, and are generally of a kind and hospi∣table disposition: The Cor∣poration consisteth of a May∣or, six Aldermen, and twelve Common Council-Men, all annually elected, and then ap∣proved
<PB N="41" REF="22"/>and sworn by the Go∣vernour. Every <HI>Sunday</HI> the Mayor and Aldermen in their Scarlet Gowns, and the Com∣mon-Council-Men in Purple, do pay a civility to the Gover∣nour, coming up to the Castle, and from thence attending him to the Church. There are in the City about 200 Families, beside Officers (who have, and keep very good Houses) and Souldiers, who have very con∣venient Quarters assigned them, Strangers, the Inhabi∣tants within the Castle, the Dwellers on the Mole, and at <HI>Whitby.</HI> Among the Inhabi∣tants there are some few of se∣veral Nations, as <HI>French, Spa∣nish,
<PB N="42" REF="23"/>Portugueses, Italians,</HI> and divers <HI>Jews</HI> both of <HI>Barbary</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> who are great Dealers in Trade, and have their several Synagogues with∣in the Town: I say, several, for although they agree in the common Reading and Vene∣ration of the five Books of <HI>Moses,</HI> their Denial of our Sa∣viour Jesus Christ, and their Hatred to Christians; yet they are not free from their little Schisms, as appears by a pas∣sage since my coming hither, which may perhaps be worth the relating.</P>
<P>On the 9th of <HI>July</HI> last, a Petition was presented to the
<PB N="43" REF="23"/>Governour by <HI>Joseph Artnitel, Samuel Mexias, Joseph Benja∣min,</HI> and <HI>Moses Benazara,</HI> in the name of the <HI>Barbary-Jews</HI> residing in <HI>Tangier,</HI> setting forth that <HI>Abraham Cohen,</HI> an <HI>Am∣sterdam-Jew,</HI> did continually affront, molest, and disquiet them, that they could not at∣tend their Callings: whereup∣on <HI>Abraham Cohen,</HI> and the <HI>European-Jews,</HI> being sum∣moned, and the matter heard, it appeared that they were on both sides in Faction and Fire, for that the said <HI>Abraham Co∣hen</HI> and his Fellows did drink Wine, and traded in Swines-Flesh; for which cause the <HI>Tangier-Jews</HI> had made their
<PB N="44" REF="24"/>complaint to the <HI>Sabios</HI> of <HI>Te∣tuan,</HI> who had actually Ex∣communicated the said <HI>Cohen,</HI> and the rest: but the Gover∣nour perceiving knavery in the business, and that the inhibi∣ting the <HI>European-Jews</HI> to bring Pork into the Town, might be out of design to hin∣der the bringing in of Provisi∣ons; and that their Appeal to the <HI>Moorish-Jews</HI> at <HI>Tetuan,</HI> and the publishing of an Ex∣communication, was a very great presumption, and an af∣front to His Majesties Govern∣ment; commanded the <HI>Bar∣bary-Jews</HI> within a few days to dissolve the Excommunica∣tion, and to renounce the Au∣thority
<PB N="45" REF="24"/>of <HI>Tetuan,</HI> or any other Power, but of the King of <HI>England;</HI> or else he would turn them and their Families out of Town: which took good effect, caused a Peace among them, and no more was heard of it.

<P>There remain in <HI>Tangier</HI> many marks of the Roman Greatness, Ingenuity, Arts, and Architecture: as,</P>
<PB N="52" REF="28"/>
<P N="1">1. The strong, vaulted, well-compiled Foundations of Houses, (in the digging up of which great store of Medals are found, of <HI>Corinthian</HI> Brass, Copper, and Silver, stamped with the Effigies of their Em∣perours, and Consuls, and with other Mottoes and Fancies.</P>
<P N="2">2. The outside of the Rock next to the Bay, between the Water-Gate and the Mole, on which the Town-Wall is built, which is faced with Rows of little Walls from the Water to the Foundation of it, equally distant one from the other; which served not only to strengthen the Foundation, and to keep it from sliding, but
<PB N="53" REF="28"/>also for an Amphitheatre; and on these Rows of Seats did the people sit to behold their Pa∣stimes and Shews upon the Water, the whole Bay being under the view of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The curious Arches and Vaults, among which I saw one built with Brick and Free∣stone, of an unknown length, about eight foot wide at the Floor, and about ten foot high; the half of which Arch is standing, and serves for a curious, close, cool Walk.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Aqueducts, of which I have given an account before. I shall not mention the Salt-Pits, (though a pretty curio∣fity, cut out in the Natural
<PB N="54" REF="29"/>Rocks that lie on the surface of the Ground within the Lines) nor the strange, deep, narrow Pits cut into the Rocks, (of which I cannot apprehend the use, unless for Burying-places) because they may be the work of the <HI>Portugueses.</HI> But one thing I must mention, a Re∣main of the <HI>Moorish</HI> Grandure, the Ruines of a most rich and sumptuous Structure, some of the Floors whereof are yet to be seen, made of small <HI>Roman</HI> Bricks two or three inches square, of divers colours, the sides of the Walls lined with delicate <HI>Mosaick</HI> Work; and in one place is an Inscription of <HI>Arabick</HI> Characters cut in
<PB N="55" REF="29"/>Stone, not worn by time, though done more than three hundred years since, very easie and plain to be read, the Let∣ters not being cut into the Stone, but the Stone cut away from the Letters; and because this is a piece of great Curio∣sity, as well as Antiquity, I have caused it to be Transcri∣bed from the Original, and afterward Translated.</P>

<HEAD>The Translation of an <HI>Arabick</HI> Inscription contained in a Stone of Marble, at the Entrance from the Vestry of the <HI>English</HI> Protestant Church of <HI>Tangier,</HI> called, <HI>CHARLES the Martyr,</HI> formerly a <HI>Moorish</HI> Convent.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In the Name of God, <HI>Amen.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AMemorandum <HI>of the holy Convent, under the Almighties Obedience, which God preserve in his Grace and Favour:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Being a Register and Roll of the Revenues and Lands be∣longing to the said Convents
<PB N="57" REF="30"/>Incommings, as well those which are situated within the City of</HI> Tangier, <HI>as without the same; together with their Limits and Districts, and how far the said Revenues do extend themselves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Those situated within the said City, are,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>First, A Shop wherein Herbs are sold; and another where Starch is made and sold; with another Shop nigh unto the Hal∣bardeers; and another Shop somewhat higher, where Oyl, Figgs, Reasons, and such like Ware is sold; and a third Shop adjoining to the former. And moreover, four other Shops, si∣tuated in the Butchers Row, ad∣joining
<PB N="58" REF="31"/>joining to each other: all which Shops afore-specified, have each of them a little back-yard: and also another Taylors Shop un∣der the Arch; with another Shop belonging to the Wafer∣sellers, next adjoining to the Bakehouse; and another Shop where Chopt Straw is sold, and Tinder and Match, and such like Commodities; and another Moyety of a Shop where the Waterbearers refort, below the Spinters, the other half of which belongs to one, called</HI> Majanez; <HI>and from thence on the other side of the Street, hard by the Shop where Spicery Wares are sold, and where the Cutlers do live, there is another Shop, equally
<PB N="59" REF="31"/>high with the said Convents situation; as also a House situa∣ted in the Street where the Stone∣cutters do live; a little higher than the Potters dwellings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Moreover, The Convent and its Church, is situated towards the</HI> West, <HI>and doth contain a Court-yard, surrounded with Houses or Lodgings; to wit, round about the whole situation; also the said Convent hath a Free-School, being a large and vast Room, in which the Inha∣bitants Children are taught to Write and Read; besides which the Convent contained all such Lodgings and Conveniences, and other necessary Offices and Ac∣commodations as behoved, and
<PB N="60" REF="32"/>were necessary and requisite for the entertaining and lodging of the Priests, Clerks, Lay-brothers, and other Ministerial Persons to the said Convent belonging and appertaining. Besides which, there was another Shop, fituated at the foot of the said Convent; and yet lower than that, a second Shop, where Earthen Ware, as Pots, Pans, and Dishes, are usually made,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And this is the Revenues which the said Convent doth enjoy within the said Cities Walls.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Revenues belonging to the said Convent situated with∣out the Walls, in the Country abroad,</HI> viz.</P>
<PB N="61" REF="32"/>
<P><HI>Consist in One hundred fifty and four several Fields and Gardens, with Houses and Wells intermingled here and there; as also with some Orchards for Fruits, and Summer-Houses for Recreation;</HI> all which are set down in the <HI>Moorish</HI> Roll, with their <HI>Moorish</HI> Names and Ap∣pellations thereunto annexed; which being conceived to be too tedious and superfluous to be here specified, are omit∣ted, as being of no moment nor benefit to be Read, but rather a trouble and vexation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being only bare <HI>Moorish</HI> obsolete Names, at present not known, nor in use, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<PB N="62" REF="33"/>
<P>Finally, The said <HI>Moorish</HI> Roll is closed in this manner following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And thus we have specified all the Revenues and Incom∣mings of the said Convent; and to the end it may remain to po∣sterity, we have Engraven it in this Stone, on the last day of the Month called</HI> Rabbea the se∣cond, <HI>In the Year Seven hun∣dred forty and three; And thus we have made an end thereof,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>God be praised, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be observed, that since this <HI>Arabick</HI> Inscription was Engraven on the said Stone,
<PB N="63" REF="33"/>there are 343 years past, it being according to the <HI>Moo∣rish</HI> Accompt the year 1086. and with us according to the <HI>Christian</HI> Computation, the year 1675. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which is on∣ly set down to shew the mean∣ing of the said <HI>Arabick</HI> Inscri∣ption and Antiquity, for the better satisfaction of your Grace, who may please your self with such a Curiofity.</P>
<P>The first Governour of <HI>Tan∣gier</HI> under the King of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> was the Earl of <HI>Peterbo∣rough,</HI> a Person of Noble and Generous Qualities, a great Friend to the Souldiers, and
<PB N="64" REF="34"/>very likely to have made the Place considerable, had not His Majesty, upon some grea∣ter Imployments, called him home.</P>
<P>In whose room was sent that excellent Souldier the Earl of <HI>Tiveot,</HI> whose Fame will be fresh, while there is a Stone standing in <HI>Tangier:</HI> he was of indefatigable Indu∣stry, a compleat Souldier, a resolute Man, and in all pro∣bability had he lived to this time, would have enlarged the Demeans of <HI>Tangier</HI> to a very great compass: but in the midst of his Endeavours, he was by false Intelligence be∣tray'd to march out with five
<PB N="65" REF="34"/>hundred men, (most of them armed only as Pioneers) and were all, except a very few that escaped, destroyed toge∣ther.</P>
<P>Immediately after whose death, Sir <HI>Tobias Bridges,</HI> who Commanded the Horse, was by joint consent of the Offi∣cers, voted to the Govern∣ment; which he held till</P>
<P>Col. <HI>John Fitz Gerald,</HI> (a Gentleman as well of known Valour, and try'd Experi∣ence, as of an Ancient Fami∣ly) was made Deputy-Gover∣nour.</P>
<P>And so remained until the Lord <HI>Bellasis</HI> was sent over, whose Gentleness, Prudence,
<PB N="66" REF="35"/>and Moderation, did mightily endear him both to Garison and Town: but his indispo∣sition urged him, within less than a year, to get His Ma∣jesties Leave to be recalled, much to the sorrow of that Place.</P>
<P>Upon his return, Col. <HI>Hen∣ry Norwood</HI> was appointed De∣puty-Governour; who not only terrified the <HI>Moors</HI> by his Arms, but out-did them in their Wit, and managed the Government of that Place with very great Honour to the King, and Advantage to the People.</P>
<P>Then the Earl of <HI>Middleton</HI> was appointed Governour, a
<PB N="67" REF="35"/>Person very famous for his Conduct in War, of great Cou∣rage, and as great Experience, of excellent Learning and Parts, and Liberal beyond Example: He made the Go∣vernours House, of a <HI>Portu∣guese</HI>-Dungeon, to become a very Noble Palace; caused the Castle, with the Store-houses of Victuals and Ammunition, to be separated from the Town by a strong Wall; and would have done many brave Things for the Good of that Place, but falling into a Flux, he was much weakned; and rising one night to call for a Candle, he stumbled over his Servant, who lay cross the
<PB N="68" REF="36"/>Threshold fast asleep, and with the fall broke his Arm short at the Shoulder, and within a few days died.</P>
<P>After his death, Col. <HI>Roger Alsop</HI> was appointed Deputy-Governour; who, if his Legs were answerable to his Heart, would give convincing Testi∣monies of his great Worthiness of that, and a much better Imployment.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Insiquin</HI> is the present Governor, whose Cha∣racter to Write, were a kind of flattery to commend before the Face; and to your Grace especially, who so well know him, I need say but this, He is of greater Abilities than either
<PB N="69" REF="36"/>himself would discover, or his Friends could expect, till he came to the Tryal of them; and I cannot doubt but that His Majesty will find him to be most useful for His Service there, or in any other Place.</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, having led you a tedious Walk round our little Town, and narrow Lines, (which may be paced over in the time that this Paper may be read) I am to beg pardon for this most impertinent Interruption; which I cannot but hope for, because innocently intended: And as I have reason to be∣lieve, your Grace will not
<PB N="70" REF="37"/>read it twice; so I seriously promise, you shall never be troubled in this manner again by,</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Then the</HI> Divan <HI>was kept in the Cas∣sale, the</HI> Aga <HI>was kept in a Cage to preserve himself from the fury of the multitude.</HI></NOTE> in a few days after, on a Holy-day, (as they were at Mass) fell upon them, and became their Masters. Where∣upon, as having before practi∣sed the Trade of Piracy, they armed all the Vessels they could make themselves Masters of,
<PB N="75" REF="39"/>and in short time had One hun∣dred &amp; fifty Sail in <HI>Corso.</HI> They builded then likewise the <HI>Cas∣sale,</HI> where the Publick Trea∣sure is kept, and the principal Magazines for Arms and Pro∣visions, and formed a Govern∣ment by a <HI>Divan,</HI> who was to sit every <HI>Saturday</HI> to con∣sult of Publick Affairs, till in the year of the <HI>Hegira</HI> 810. in respect to the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> they admitted Bashaws of his to precide in the <HI>Divan,</HI> and Govern them; (only keeping in their hands the Command of the <HI>Cassale:</HI>) The first where∣of was called <HI>Osman Bashaw,</HI> allowing them 12000 Dollars <HI>per annum</HI> out of the pay, be∣sides
<PB N="76" REF="40"/>an allowance of all sorts of Provision for his whole Fa∣mily and Officers.</P>
<P>Under these Bashaws (who above the said allowance found ways to exact great Treasures from the <HI>Moors</HI> and Inhabi∣tants, in so much that some of them, after their ordinary three years residence, have been known to carry away 200000 Dollars, besides Jewels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) they lived with great Obedi∣ence, notwithstanding all the said Oppressions, until the time of <HI>Ʋsuff Bashaw,</HI> a Gal∣lant Prince, and one that made it more his business to increase the Conquests against the <HI>Moors,</HI> than to mass up Wealth,
<PB N="77" REF="40"/>for which reason then, upon the Petition of the Publick <HI>Divan,</HI> his Commission by the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> was renewed. He took <HI>Constantine</HI> from the <HI>Moors, Bugia</HI> from the <HI>Christians, Bona</HI> from the <HI>Tuniseenes,</HI> marched with his Army in∣to the <HI>Zachary,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A desart Coun∣try only affording Dates.</NOTE> sixty days South-East, and continued his Con∣quest four months march to∣wards <HI>Angola,</HI> all which are to this day Tributary to <HI>Algiers:</HI> So having been two years in the Camp, he returned in great triumph, accompanied with all the popular applauses ima∣ginable. But all this could not secure him from the secret con∣spiracy
<PB N="78" REF="41"/>of his <HI>Kia;</HI> who, ha∣ving had the sweetness and be∣nefit of the pay in his absence, made a faction against him, murdering him in the <HI>Bettistan,</HI> or <HI>Market-place,</HI> in the year 1642. Since which time, though they have received the Bashaws sent by the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> yet have they never admitted them to sit in the <HI>Di∣van,</HI> or to meddle with Pub∣lick Affairs, but they have been muzled, receiving only their ancient allowance, the extraordinary Revenues being wholly taken away; so that this place being not of so great profit as was formerly, it has not been so greedily sought for
<PB N="79" REF="41"/>at the <HI>Ottomans Porte,</HI> witness this present Bashaw, called <HI>Is∣mael,</HI> who has lived here now near fifteen years.</P>
<P>After the said Rebellion, there has been a person chosen out of, and by the <HI>Divan,</HI> to sit over the pay, and had the Title of Governour. To his care was committed the receipt and payment of all money brought into the Publick; and his presence required at the pay of the Souldiers, which is every two months. Thir∣teen persons have succeeded in this Office, of which but one is found to have died in his bed, the other having been poisoned, or murthered by
<PB N="80" REF="42"/>some means or other. The last that served in that Office, was <HI>Ally Aga,</HI> who was cut in pieces by the Souldiers in the year 1672. after their Ships were burnt in <HI>Bugia:</HI> When the said <HI>Ally Aga</HI> came to the Government, the <HI>Divan</HI> con∣sisted of <HI>Bulga-Bashaws, Geo-Bashaws,</HI> and <HI>Youde-Bashaws,</HI> in all above one thousand Per∣sons, besides that the Souldi∣ers would come into the <HI>Divan</HI> upon any Foreign Affair that was to be debated; so that it was a rabble of people, and a confused multitude, until he found a way to reduce them to forty eight, of each quality beforementioned, <HI>viz.</HI> 144
<PB N="81" REF="42"/>persons in all, whereof himself was the head. The day that he was murthered, all the Soul∣diers were in Arms in great confusion; some that were of his party fled and escaped, o∣thers were kill'd in the Streets, and in their Houses: the <HI>Ba∣shaw</HI> then brought out the <HI>Grand Seigniors</HI> Bandera, and made Burgone, That all Soul∣diers should come under it; which they readily submitted to; so that it was believed the <HI>Bashaw</HI> would be brought into the Kings House, or place of Judicature, and the former Authority of his Predecessors not only restored, but also the Keys of the <HI>Cassale</HI> given him,
<PB N="82" REF="43"/>when in the middle of the tu∣mult, a bolder fellow than the rest cry'd out to bring in <HI>Ma∣homet Raise Treig,</HI> formerly Admiral,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Present Go∣vernment.</NOTE> but at that time in disgrace: this cry was seconded by all the Sea-faring people, and in less than half an hour it was deter∣mined to fetch <HI>Treig</HI> to the Kings House. The Old Man knew not whether they came to Kill, or to Crown him: But so soon as he came there, he was given to understand that they had chosen him Go∣vernour; which he obstinately refused, until some that had occasioned his coming thither, cryed, <HI>Father, Will you let us
<PB N="83" REF="43"/>suffer by your Humility?</HI> Up∣on which he made a bold speech to the Souldiers, telling them, <HI>If they gave the Govern∣ment into his hands, he would be absolute, and no ways con∣trouled by the</HI> Divan; <HI>whose Counsel he would willingly ad∣here unto, but the Decisive Vote should be left to him.</HI> They, unwilling to refuse him any thing at that time, did above all this deliver unto him the Keys of the <HI>Cassale,</HI> never be∣fore in the possession of one man, but kept by Eighty <HI>Bulga-Bashaws</HI> that attended there by turns, Eighty every week going up and exchanging the other Eighty; and so they pro∣claimed
<PB N="84" REF="44"/>him by the Name of <HI>Dey,</HI> making him Superinten∣dent over all the Militia by Sea and Land, Director of the <HI>Cadees,</HI> and Head of the <HI>Divan.</HI> To his assistance they joined <HI>Babba Hassan,</HI>

<P>I Know not if it be proper to set down here the Chri∣stian Slaves also, that accor∣ding

<PB N="93" REF="48"/>best agreement they can make; and what they can make more, is not in the power of the Pa∣tron to take away from them; by which means many thou∣sands of Captives have ob∣tained their liberty by their own industry. They have also liberty to say Mass, and hear it every day in the week at the respective Banyards, and places allowed for that service. The Protestants also have a place to preach and pray in, which is performed in the <HI>English</HI> Consuls House by the several Nations, <HI>English, German,</HI> and <HI>Dutch, &amp;c.</HI>

<HEAD>Militia.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Militia</HI> consists of two sorts of Souldiers, of which the principal are the <HI>Levant-Turks,</HI> brought hither yearly by Ships employed to that service, as occasion re∣quires. At their first entrance into their pay, they are called young <HI>Turks,</HI> and have four <HI>Dobles per</HI> month, four Loafs of bread <HI>per diem,</HI> and a Lodg∣ing in the <HI>Casharee,</HI> or Publick Quarter: his pay increaseth one <HI>Doble per annum,</HI> and one <HI>Doble</HI> every time he goes into the Camp, and engageth against
<PB N="97" REF="50"/>the Enemy, and one <HI>Doble</HI> for every head he brings from the Enemy. At the death or re∣moval of every <HI>Bashaw,</HI> or <HI>Dey,</HI> or <HI>Governour,</HI> the pay increaseth one <HI>Doble per</HI> month, until his pay amount to forty <HI>Dobles per</HI> month, and his bread to eight Loaves <HI>per diem;</HI> then he is in full pay, and can rise no higher in pay, although he hath never so high an Office: so that the pay of the <HI>Dey</HI> himself is no more than forty <HI>Dobles per</HI> month, and eight Loaves of bread, though he hath other Perqui∣sites, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that amounts to a vast, but unknown sum. If a Souldier marries, he loses
<PB N="98" REF="51"/>the benefit of his bread, and lodging in the <HI>Casharee.</HI> A Souldiers first Preferment is to be <HI>Spahee,</HI> or <HI>Trooper;</HI> from a <HI>Spahee</HI> he comes to be a <HI>Ste∣ward</HI> of the <HI>Casharee,</HI> or a <HI>Quartermaster</HI> for his <HI>Tent:</HI> from thence an <HI>Oude-Bashaw,</HI> and then a <HI>Yeo-Bashaw:</HI> the eldest <HI>Yeo-Bashaw</HI> is <HI>Kia,</HI> or <HI>High Sheriff</HI> of the City; he in two months becomes <HI>Aga,</HI> or <HI>Lord Mayor</HI> of the City; whose Office, as I said before, lasts but two months, and then he is <HI>misuled,</HI> and past all Of∣fices of the Government; stands in full pay, and is called <HI>Mis∣sul'd Aga:</HI> It is usual to be thirty or forty years in pay
<PB N="99" REF="51"/>before they come to that Of∣fice.</P>
<P>But the poorest Souldier, and though never so ignorant and incapable, when his turn comes, is set on Horse-back, and hath a rich Vest put upon him, and made <HI>Aga</HI> for two months, which may be worth to him, besides the Honour, about five hundred <HI>Dollars.</HI> There are many Souldiers that, after they arrive to be <HI>Spahees,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sometimes an</HI> A∣ga <HI>is changed in two days, but he hath the full allow∣ance for the whole time.</HI></NOTE> de∣sire to continue so; and then they, next to him, take his Office: Of these are about two thousand, that have their allowance for their Horses, and
<PB N="100" REF="52"/>are in full pay, keep ranging up and down the Country, and have Free-Quarter where-ever they go amongst the <HI>Moors:</HI> They assist the <HI>Beyes</HI> to gather in Contribution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Runnegadoes.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ARunnegado</HI> that is writ∣ten in the pay, enjoys all the benefit that a Natural <HI>Turk</HI> doth, and is made <HI>Aga</HI> when his turn comes, as well as a <HI>Levant-Turk.</HI> If a Slave turns <HI>Runnegado,</HI> it is at the pleasure of his Patron to have him written in the pay, for he
<PB N="101" REF="52"/>continues still a Slave, unless his Patron gives him his liber∣ty. There are of the <HI>Runne∣gadoes</HI> written in pay about three thousand.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Zwows.</HEAD>
<P>THe next rank of Souldi∣ers are called <HI>Zwows;</HI> these are <HI>Moors</HI> that List them∣selves in pay upon any extra∣ordinary occasion, and are <HI>du∣rante beneplacito,</HI> and their pay never exceeds twenty <HI>Dobles per</HI> month. But their Officers are better paid, which are elective: These are always
<PB N="102" REF="53"/>placed in front of the Battle, with Muskets. To which may be added the <HI>Subby Anni,</HI> a sort of resolute salvage <HI>Moors,</HI> that wait upon the <HI>Turks,</HI> and live upon the spoil of the Ene∣my: They fight with Pikes or Launces only. Of the <HI>Zwows</HI> are in number and pay about four thousand.</P>
<P>When they fight with the <HI>Moors</HI> and overcome them, all the spoil of the Enemy is brought to the <HI>Deyes</HI> or <HI>Ge∣nerals Tent,</HI> it being account∣ed a great crime and disgrace for any Souldier to touch the worth of an <HI>Asper,</HI> but to get the heads of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and bring them to the <HI>Deyes Tent,</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="53"/>receiving for every head as be fore hath been said, a <HI>Doble per</HI> month in pay until he comes in full pay, by which means they seldom or never give Quarter in time of fight; nor is there between any Ene∣mies in the World such an ha∣tred as the <HI>Moors</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> bear one to the other. Their Order of March and Discipline in the Camp, is so little diffe∣rent from the <HI>Turks</HI> in other parts of the <HI>Grand Seigniors</HI> Territories, that it will be needless to relate more of them.</P>

<HEAD>Naval Forces, and Dis∣cipline thereof.</HEAD>
<P>THeir Naval Forces four years since was the greatest part destroyed by the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Cape Spartle</HI> and <HI>Bu∣gia:</HI> but they have since built about five and twenty Sail of Ships, good Men of War, from twenty to forty Guns, and have at present thirty two Men of War, and three Galleys, the List whereof I have here∣unto annexed, besides several Brigantines and small Crafts, and two Ships upon the Stock
<PB N="105" REF="54"/>that will carry fifty Guns each. The manner of maintaining is different to any that I have either seen or heard of; for of all the said Ships and Gal∣leys, not one of them belongs to the Publick, but all to pri∣vate persons, armed out as our Privateers in <HI>England.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Souldiers know when their turn is to go into the Camp, at which time he may not be absent.</HEAD>
<P>THe Souldiers that go to Sea in their Ships, are not taken notice of when they Embark, nor are commanded
<PB N="106" REF="55"/>to that service; so that it is not easie to know how many Men go in every Ship, being some∣times twice as many as at other times; and if a Souldier lose a Leg or an Arm in the Sea∣service, he is cut off half his pay, and is incapable of any other Office in the Publick.</P>
<P>The Armadors that fit out the Ships, provide no Ammu∣nition for the small Arms, but each Soldier finds his own Mus∣quet and Cutles, with Powder and Shot. For Provision they have only Bread and Vinegar, and some few Olives from the Armadors.</P>
<P>They lie always upon the Deck without Cabins or Ha∣macks,
<PB N="107" REF="55"/>and are quartered in time of fight not much diffe∣rent to what they are in our Men of War. The Souldiers that are upon the upper Deck, and stand only to their Mus∣quets, are called the <HI>Tiffa.</HI> They have great encourage∣ment for entring of the Prize if they fight; he that gets an Ensign hath a reward some∣times of three hundred <HI>Dollars;</HI> and the like is given to the first, second, and third Man that enters, according to the hazard he hath attempted.</P>

<HEAD>How they share their Plunder.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the Prize is ta∣ken, there is no Pow∣der belongs to any body, but all is brought to the Main-mast and sold, and that money is kept and joined to the rest. Then the Ship, Goods, and Slaves are sold for the most; one eighth part of the Goods and Slaves belong to the Pub∣lick, and half of the Hull of the Ship, the other half be∣longs to the Armadors, after the <HI>Beylick</HI> or publick part is deducted, one half of the rest is the Armadors, the remainder belongs to the Ships company,
<PB N="109" REF="56"/>and is thus shared: The Cap∣tain hath twenty shares for himself, the Leiutenant five shares, the Gunner three shares, the Gunroom crew and best Souldiers two shares, the private Souldiers one share; a <HI>Christian</HI> Slave hath two shares; a salvage <HI>Moor</HI> (of which many go to Sea) one share. There goes also an <HI>Aga</HI> in each Ship, whose Of∣fice is the same of a Judge Ad∣vocate, and hath a greater Command over the Men than the Captain, except in time of Fight; He is sent on Board by the Publick to re∣present at his return any diffe∣rence that should happen on
<PB N="110" REF="57"/>Board in the time of the Voy∣age; He hath for his pains three shares. All the Goods that are taken in the Prize, as well the Christians as the Hull of the Ship, are sold by an Outcry, and the whole Sum kept intire untill all be sold; and then after the Pub∣lick part is deducted, the Ar∣madors and Souldiers share the rest, as before-mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>Galleys.</HEAD>
<P>THe Galleys are seldom armed out but in the Summer, and are rather a charge to the Armadors than profit, having seldom taken any purchase considerable: The charge of putting out a Galley is usually imposed up∣on such persons as are known to be very Wealthy, who have a Banyard to keep their Slaves in, whereof there are three, according to the num∣ber of the Galleys, to each of them belonging about
<PB N="112" REF="58"/>three hundred Slaves, out of whose ransom the Armadors do draw no small profit, as having bought them com∣monly for an inconsiderable price, and not granting them their liberty again but at a high rate, the poorest of them pays one thousand <HI>Dobles,</HI> or about three hundred <HI>Dollars,</HI> with its Port-charges inclu∣ded.</P>

<PB N="123" REF="63"/>they are carried to the Kings House, and entred a∣gain, where every farthing that is offered for them more than was in <HI>Batistan,</HI> turns to the benefit of the Publick, be∣sides every Slave pays to the Publick fifteen <HI>Dollars</HI> for his head, and ten <HI>per cent.</HI> for so much as he is redeemed for: Add to this the ⅛ part of all Prizes, and what else is ex∣acted by the Revenues laid up∣on all sorts of people, which all amounts to a vast unknown sum of money.</P>
<P>Every two months they pay their Soldiers;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Person is permitted to go in∣to the Treasury.</NOTE> and what money re∣mains, is sent up
<PB N="124" REF="64"/>to the <HI>Cassale,</HI> from whence they have never yet taken any thing: so that the mass of Wealth that is believed to be therein, might very well de∣fray the charges of an Army, fit to take both that and the City; when it was blown up by the <HI>Collolies,</HI> that part stood where the Treasure lies, and received little or no prejudice.</P>

<HEAD>Their Trade.</HEAD>
<P>THe Trade of <HI>Algier</HI> is the most inconsiderable of any great populous City in the World, depending chiefly upon the success of their Py∣rates: among the <HI>Tukrs</HI> I do not find ten Merchants, and they only use to <HI>Tunis</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> from whence they are supplied with Linnen Cloth, Coffee, and other Mer∣chandize.</P>
<P>The Handicrafts-men are chiefly <HI>Collolis,</HI> or Sons of <HI>Turks,</HI> who being uncapable of Preferment in the Govern∣ment,
<PB N="126" REF="65"/>are brought up to earn their bread, and are well im∣proved in their several Arts. Every Trade and Profession hath an <HI>Emeene,</HI> or Master of the Company, whose care is in effect the same as the Ma∣sters and Wardens of a Com∣pany in <HI>London;</HI> but more ab∣solute, it being in his power, and also incumbent upon him, to chastise any of them with blows, when they shall de∣serve it, or lay what for∣feit he sees cause upon any misdemeanor; to force them to pay their debts, if for any Commodity belonging to their Trade, and to demean themselves civilly. Each Trade
<PB N="127" REF="65"/>lives in a Street by it self. The Power given the <HI>Emeene</HI> is no small ease to the Governours. They have a Fabrick of Cloth, and Linnen, and almost all things necessary for Mankind; so that the Manufactories they stand in need of from <HI>Chri∣stendom,</HI> is so often supplied by Prizes, that the Consumpti∣on of the place supplyed by Merchants, is most inconside∣rable.</P>
<P>Of <HI>English,</HI> the Goods brought hither is chiefly Cloth, of which four hun∣dred pieces <HI>per annum</HI> is the greatest Consumption, some Iron, Lead, and Tin, but in all not enough to employ one
<PB N="128" REF="66"/>good Ship to make two Voy∣ages a year.</P>
<P>The current money of that Country is <HI>Aspers,</HI> of which 232. make a <HI>Ryall</HI> of 8 8, a Coyn that is altogether unfit for any other Country, being not full three quarters of an Ounce of Silver in a <HI>Dollar</HI> of <HI>Ryall</HI> 8 8. They Coyn also a Substance of Gold, which is the just weight of an <HI>Hunga∣rian,</HI> and is worth two <HI>Ryalls</HI> 8 8, and three quarters in <HI>As∣pers,</HI> so that a Merchant that brings his Wares hither by selling them for the money of the Country, finds loss of twenty <HI>per cent.</HI> to the pound in the exchange of <HI>Spanish</HI> mo∣ney,
<PB N="129" REF="66"/>that it hath much discou∣raged all Trade hither.</P>
<P>The greatest production of Merchandize to be transport∣ed of the growth of the Coun∣try, is Wax, about three hun∣dred <HI>Kintals per annum,</HI> Hydes about twenty thousand, and nothing else worth noting; but of Prize-Goods no small quantity, having been, as I have particularly noted, one hundred eighty and seven Prizes brought in, in less than two years and an half.</P>
<P>All Goods that are not <HI>contrabanda</HI> to be brought from <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> pay 11 1 2 <HI>per</HI> Custom, a Ship pays fifty <HI>Dollars</HI> Port-charges, and a
<PB N="130" REF="67"/>Barrel of Powder to the <HI>Cas∣sabe.</HI></P>
<P>The Weights and Measures are no ways altered since the time that several have under∣taken to give an accompt thereof.</P>
