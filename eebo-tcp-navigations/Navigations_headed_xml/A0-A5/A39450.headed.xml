<HEAD>A PROJECT OF Conditions of Peace.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Is Majesties inviolable fide∣lity in adhering to his Alliances, hath induced him never to listen to any Proposals of Peace, other than such as shall give a full and perfect satis∣faction to the King of <HI>Sueden:</HI> which likewise having been absolutely promised to his Majesty by the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who was earnest to gain this point, both for him and for the <HI>States General;</HI> he now likewise makes it the first Article that he in∣sists upon, and without which he cannot come to any conclusion upon the rest.</P>
<P>And because the Interest of the Duke of <HI>Got∣torp</HI> is so united to that of <HI>Sueden,</HI> that it makes a part of the Treaty of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> for the performance of which, his Majesty gave his Garranty
<PB N="2" REF="8"/> to that Crown; his Majesty desires, that he may now likewise be comprehended within this Treaty, upon such terms as shall be satisfactory to himself.</P>
<P>As for the Prince and Bishop of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> the King doth precisely insist upon the restitution of that Prince, and of all his Family, to all their Estates, Goods Honours, and Prerogatives; and particularly upon the restitution of his Brother Prince <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Furstemburg:</HI> whose Liberty must be provided for by one of the first Articles of the Peace.</P>
<P>For what concerns the Empire, as his Majesty doth still continue in the same intention which he has expressed for its Peace, that he has been troubled to see it disturbed; that it was with much trouble of mind he found himself compelled to carry the War thither; so he does yet adhere to these publick Declarations, which he has so often made, That he will insist onely upon the restoring of the Treaties of <HI>Westphalia</HI> in all their points, and to have them once more to be the means of restoring Peace to <HI>Germany</HI> Which induces him to offer this Alternative to the Emperor; Either that the Emperor shall re∣store <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> and have <HI>Friburg</HI> restored to him; or else keep <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> and let his Majesty continue in possession of <HI>Friburg,</HI> without making any the least alteration in the other matters con∣tained in the said Treaties.</P>
<P>As for what concerns <HI>Spain,</HI> since its Interest appears to be the most considerable in this War, and both <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and some Estates bordering upon <HI>Flanders</HI> have further express'd their desire, that that Crown should retain such a Frontier in the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI> as might be able to make that a Bar, which they judge is so very important to their safety; his Majesty has
<PB N="3" REF="8"/> been pleased, at the instance of the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to agree to the means for the setling it. And upon this consideration it is, as his Majesty declared himself to that Prince, that he has offered already, and doth yet offer to restore to <HI>Spain</HI> those following Places, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Place of <HI>Charleroy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Limburg,</HI> and its Appurtenances.</P>
<P><HI>Binch,</HI> and the Provostship thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Aeth,</HI> and its Chastellany.</P>
<P><HI>Oudenard,</HI> and its Chastellany there.</P>
<P><HI>Courtray,</HI> and its Chastellany; the Verge of <HI>Me∣nin</HI> onely excepted.</P>
<P><HI>Gand,</HI> and its dependances.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Guillain;</HI> but with its Fortifications rased.</P>
<P>For so many Places of importance, and which his Majesty has taken so much care, and been at so great expence to Fortifie; he requires in exchange, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> quit his right to those Places which his Majesty hath possessed himself of in this last War.</P>
<P>All <HI>Franche Compte.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> and its Dependances.</P>
<P><HI>Bouchain,</HI> and its Dependances.</P>
<P><HI>Conde,</HI> and its Dependances.</P>
<P><HI>Cambray</HI> and <HI>Cambresis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Air,</HI> St. <HI>Omers,</HI> and their Dependances.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Ipre,</HI> and its Chastellany.</P>
<P>The Places of <HI>Werwick</HI> and <HI>Werneton,</HI> on the River <HI>Lis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bavay</HI> and <HI>Maubeage,</HI> with their Dependancies.</P>
<P><HI>Poperingue, Bailleul,</HI> and <HI>Cassel,</HI> with their De∣pendances.</P>
<P>In a word, that he quit his Right to all such Places and Countreys as his Majesty hath now in his possession; excepting those before mentioned,
<PB N="4" REF="9"/> which his Majesty is willing to restore to <HI>Spain;</HI> The Town of <HI>Charlemont,</HI> or in lieu thereof, the Towns of <HI>Dinant</HI> and <HI>Bouvines;</HI> upon condition that he, at the choice of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> will charge himself, that the Bishop of <HI>Liege</HI> shall quit his right to <HI>Dinant,</HI> and that the Emperor and Empire shall give their assent thereunto. By this means the <HI>Spanish</HI> Frontier in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> would for the future begin from the Sea, to the <HI>Meuse, Newport, Dixmude, Courtray, Oudenard, Aeth, Mons, Charleroy,</HI> and <HI>Namur.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Articles which concern the <HI>States General,</HI> they are so very favourable, that they cannot but conclude, that his Majesty doth fully purpose to receive them into the former Friend∣ship, after the Peace shall be concluded. His Ma∣jesty is willing to restore them <HI>Maestricht,</HI> and to agree to the Treaty of Commerce, in such form as it was framed at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> with the Sieur <HI>Bever∣ning.</HI></P>
<P>And to the end his Majesty may give the World the utmost testimony of his sincere intentions for the Peace, his Majesty, notwithstanding any reason that might induce him to continue in possession of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> is willing that Prince <HI>Charles</HI> be restored to it, upon one of these two Alternatives, of which he gives him his choice.</P>
<P>First, That he be restored according to the Arti∣cles expressed in the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty, without any change or alteration in any of them.</P>
<P>Or secondly, That he be restored generally to his whole Estate, except the Town of <HI>Nancy,</HI> which his Majesty will retain, with plenary Right of So∣vereignty, and excepting such a way as was agreed upon at the Treaty of 1661. to pass from the Fron∣tiers
<PB N="5" REF="9"/> of <HI>France</HI> into <HI>Alsatia,</HI> and all such ways as shall be necessary to pass from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Nancy;</HI> and from <HI>Nancy</HI> to <HI>Metz, Brisac,</HI> and <HI>Franche Compte;</HI> upon condition nevertheless, that to make him some compensation for the Town of <HI>Nancy,</HI> his Majesty shall resign to him that of <HI>Toul,</HI> con∣siderable for its extent and situation, and much more in respect of its Bishoprick.</P>
<P>His Majesty demands likewise, that <HI>Long-Wic</HI> and its Provostship be quitted to him: but offereth withall to recompense the Prince of <HI>Lorrain</HI> with another provostship of equal value within one of the three Bishopricks. And whereas <HI>Marsal</HI> having been quitted to his Majesty by a particular Treaty, is not at present any part of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> so it is not to be understood to be comprised in this restitution.</P>
<P>These are the Terms which may, and ought to make the Platform of a General Peace, and upon which his Majesty hath long ago declared himself to the King of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> His Majesty desires that they may be imparted to the Assembly at <HI>Ni∣meguen;</HI> and that his own Plenipotentiaries there propose them to the consideration of the rest, as con∣taining the lowest Conditions that he can admit; and upon which his Enemies may make choice either of War or Peace.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Written from the Camp at</HI> Deinse, <DATE><HI>the 18th. of</HI> May, 1678.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>Most dear great Friends, Allies, and Confederates,</P>
<P><HI>OUt of the sincere affection which we have al∣ways born to the promoting of the Peace of</HI> Europe, <HI>we are very much satisfi'd to under∣stand, by our Plenipotentiaries at</HI> Nimeguen, <HI>the account given unto them in your name, by one of your Ambassadors, concerning your thoughts upon the conclusion of so great a Work, which you had imparted to them by one of your Ambassadors. We are glad to understand, that the terms which we proposed at that Assembly appear to you to be rea∣sonable, and that you are fully perswaded of the sincerity of our mind, in a matter of so great im∣portance: And it is with the greater fatissaction to our selves, that we confirm the same unto you by this Letter; because notwithstanding those ad∣vantages which we have already acquir'd by our Arms, and may justly hope for by the prosecution of the War; yet we place our chiefest glory in making all the steps we can towards a Peace. But because it appears by the Discourses that have been made to our Plenipotentiaries by your order, that how desirous soever you are to conclude the Peace, yet there remains some scruple with you concerning the Seventh Article of the Treaty of Commerce, which has been debated at</HI> Nimeguen <HI>between our Am∣bassadors
<PB N="7" REF="10"/> and yours; and trouble of mind, lest we should make an entire Conquest of the</HI> Low-Countreys, <HI>in case</HI> Spain <HI>should reject the Terms we have offered, we are willing to impart our thoughts unto you upon those two Points. We cannot do it more favourably, as to the first of them, than by granting, that the Seventh Article should be as your selves desire it. And in taking such measures with you upon the second Point, as may ease you of the fear you express for the loss of</HI> Flanders. <HI>And this we will then do, when</HI> Spain <HI>having refused to consent to the Peace, there shall be a Treaty con∣cluded between us and you, upon such Terms as have been already propos'd with relation to your selves, and that you shall have returned to our Alliance, and shall oblige your selves to continue Neuters during the War. We shall be always ready for your sakes to grant to</HI> Spain <HI>the same Terms, with rela∣tion to</HI> Flanders, <HI>which they are at liberty now to accept: And we are further willing to assure you, that in all that time we will not Attaque any one Place in those Provinces. Thus you shall always find us readily inclined, not onely to form that Bar which you think so necessary for your own safety, but to secure it; and to let you enjoy, together with the re∣establishment of Commerce, what∣ever other advantages you can expect from our Friendship. And if for the prosecuting this Ne∣gotiation you shall think it necessary to send Depu∣ties to us, they will find us near</HI> Ghent <HI>till the 27th. day of this Month, and in the same dispo∣sitions we have declared to you in this Letter. In the mean time, we pray God to take you, most dear great Friends, Allies, and Confederates.</HI>

<HEAD>The Memorial which the King Ordered to be delivered to the Sieur <HI>Van Beverning,</HI> Ambassador Extraordinary from the States General of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> to his Majesty.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THe King hath with pleasure seen, as by the Let∣ter of the Heeren the States General, so by the Assurances which they have given him by the Heer</HI> Van Beverning, <HI>their Extraordinary Ambassador, that their Intentions to a General Peace, correspond with the desire his Majesty hath had to procure the same, and that they are ready to accept the</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="12"/> <HI>Conditions which his Majesty hath offered them by his Ambassadors and Plenipotentaries at</HI> Nimeguen. <HI>But at the same time that the Heer</HI> Van Beverning <HI>hath thus made known to him the Sentiments of the said States General, he hath in their Name prayed his Majesty would grant a Cessation of Arms for six Weeks, and hath represented to him, that they had need of that time, to communicate with their Allies, and to obtain their consent for the conclud∣ing of so great a work. The condition in which his Majesties Arms are at present, and the favou∣rable opportunity that would be lost in deferring their acting, would not permit him to consent to this Proposal, if the desire to give Peace to</HI> Europe, <HI>did not much more prevail in him, than that of enlarging his Frontiers by new Conquests. It is in this consideration to contribute to the Publick Re∣pose, that he will agree, at the desire of the said States General, to a Cessation of Arms for six weeks, to begin the first day of the next month, such an one as was stipulated between</HI> France <HI>and</HI> Spain <HI>in the year 1668. But forasmuch as it would not be just, if the Enemies of His Majesty should let that time pass fruitlesly, and that instead of its serving to advance the Peace, they should make advanttge thereof, to avoid the effect of his Majesties Arms, that he should have lost the advantageous conjun∣cture which is at present in his hand; His Majesty desires of the said States General, that they do pro∣mise him in case, during the time of the said Cessa∣tion of Arms, they cannot bring their Allies to accept the conditions which he hath offered, They will not assist them directly or indirectly against him, or against his Allies, during the whole course of the War. In exchange his Majesty will in such</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="13"/> <HI>case renew to them the same Engagements which he hath taken with them by his Letter of the 18 of the last Month, as well for what concerns the same Con∣ditions, which he will be always ready to agree to</HI> Spain, <HI>as for the security of the Places in the</HI> Nether∣lands. <HI>His Majesty hath thought fit to make known to the said States General, by this Memorial, which he hath appointed to be delivered to the Heer</HI> Van Be∣verning, <HI>the sincerity of his intentions for a Peace. And to give them a yet far greater testimony there∣of, he doth command the Duke of</HI> Luxemburg, <HI>General of his Army, to go and expect their Answer, during this Month, in the Neighbourhood af</HI> Brussels, <HI>with orders not to Attaque any Place during that time.</HI> Given in the Camp at <HI>Wetteren,</HI> the first day of <HI>June,</HI> 1678.</P>

<HEAD>A Declaration given by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> con∣taining their consent to the Conditions proposed by his Majesty in order to a Peace.</HEAD>
<P>HIs Excellency having seen and considered this Memorial, and at the same time made parti∣cular reflection upon the former ones of the 8th. and the 14th. of <HI>May;</HI> though the States General of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> know very well, that the terms upon which the King of <HI>France</HI> has offered to make Peace with <HI>Spain</HI> are very hard; yet consi∣dering the misfortune and extremities that the <HI>Low-Countreys</HI> are exposed to, and that their Hi. and Mi. (though otherwise so much concerned also in the In∣terest of their preservation) do yet find themselves at present deprived of all means to effect it, their People not being in condition to carry on the War; and considering that in this Juncture of Affairs, nothing can be of so great importance, as the preservation of that miserable Remainder of <HI>Flanders,</HI> by strict Alliances, which they persuade us to accept of, and value. And whereas in the said Memorial, the States General do represent their instances of, and desire to admit of the said Conditions, in order to the conclusion of a Peace; his Excellency being willing to second them, as he hath done from the very first time that his Master entred into the War, which he undertook first for the preservation of the Confe∣derates Estates of the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI> and has since continued to assert the common Interest, is now likewise willing to comply with the desire of the States General, and to admit of a Peace upon
<PB N="15" REF="14"/> such terms as the King of <HI>France</HI> hath propos'd, to the end that so convincing a proof of his Ex∣cellencies servent desire to unite him with the said States General, may contribute to strengthen their mutual Alliances, and conduce to the pre∣servation of both their Estates. Still provided, That whatsoever Conquests the most Christian King may have made in any part of the World, within the Dominions of the King his Master, and not specified in the above-said Propositions, shall be restored to his Majesty: Hoping moreover, that the States General will so far interpose with his most Christian Majesty, as that he will be pleased not to insist upon those terms, which it is not in his Majesties power to perform; and to grant us such terms as may be effectual for the preservation of what we have left; and that the States General will likewise take care, that the Borders and Fronteers may be so fixed, as to pre∣vent for the future any such Accidents and Oc∣currences, as may prove the seeds of a new War, and contribute to the greater satisfaction of the Confederates High Allies.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Declaration on the behalf of the King of</HI> Denmark.</HEAD>
<P>THe Ambassador Extraordinary, and Plenipoten∣tiary of his Majesty the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> at the Treaty of Peace held at <HI>Ni∣meguen;</HI> hath seen by the communication which the Deputies of the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> have made to the Ministers of the Con∣federates at the <HI>Hague,</HI> what his Most Christian Majesty was pleased to Order the delivery of in writ∣ing to his Excellency the Sieur <HI>de Beverning</HI> their Ambassador Extraordinary, as well touching his con∣sent to a Cessation of Arms for Six weeks, as concern∣ing his demand of a promise from the States General, that in case they shall not be able during that Cessa∣tion, to prevail with their Allies to accept of such Terms as his Majesty hath offered, that then they will no longer Assist them directly or indirectly, against him or his Allies during the continuance of the War; And having thereupon considered what he conceives is fit and necessary for the Kind his Master to do upon occassion of his Most Christian Majesties said agreement and demand; He thinks it his duty to represent to their Excellencies, the Ambassadors Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiaries of the High Allies at this Congress, that presupposing, which he does without any doubt, the constancy and re∣solution of the States General, wherewith they have always hitherto maintain'd the Credit and Ho∣nour of their Treaties, which is the true band and most proper support of a free Common-wealth, That they will not do any thing that may cast the least
<PB N="17" REF="15"/> blemish upon the Reputation which they have hither∣to honourably accquired and maintain'd, His Majesty assures himself that in this juncture, they will not set one step to the Prejudice of those mutual engage∣ments that are betwixt himself and them: in discharge of which he has vouchsafed to hazard his own sacred Person, and the choicest blood of his Subjects, to the expence of what the utmost of the revenue of all his Kingdoms and Estates would amount to. Every one may remember into what extremity of Affairs his Majesty was willing, when requested, to throw himself in the midst of those Calamities, that then oppressed the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> and some of the Confederates, with intention to deliver them from the ruine that threatned them, and to take part with them in their most dangerous Events: What course he took to effect this, and the benefit which has accrewed by his Engaging in it, both to the common cause of all the Confederates, and to their Hi. and Mi. the States General of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> in particular, is sufficiently known to all the World: so that it would be to no purpose to make a repetation of them here. A sure and honourable Peace is what every one now aims at: For the obtaining whereof, if the mutual engage∣ments which the Confederates stand in one to ano∣ther, continue in force, we ought to Treat upon terms, and not take them ready made to our hands. It has been demonstrated more then once by preg∣nant and undeniable Arguments and Reasons, that a Cessation of Arms must needs come attended with many great mischiefs and inconveniences: if there are more cogent Arguments why the States Ge∣neral of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> in respect of their own Affairs in particular, and the concerns of such
<PB N="18" REF="16"/> whose interest is the same with theirs, should ac∣cept of a Truce with <HI>France,</HI> we may well hope at least that that consideration will not be thought sufficient to oblige others, whose Affairs are in quit different circumstances, to come into the Truce likewise: And that they will so qualifie the condi∣tions of their Truce, as that what makes for the advantage of one part of the Allies, may not be to the utter ruine of all the rest; though the Arms of <HI>France</HI> are attended with a strange current of Success, yet the faithfulness of which the Most Christian King makes profession, in adhering to his Allies, ought not to triumph over their constancy, whom common interest has linked together in a sacred bond for their mutual preservation. This vertue will make them respected even among their enemies; whereas the contrary would blast all their Reputations, and lead them one by one into Calamities, which they would discover the cause of too late, when the effects would be remediless. His Most Christian Majesty has given the States General a very short time to declare themselves upon the contents of his Memorial, the foresight of his Councel saw very well, that the time would be too short for all the parties concern'd to be well advised: and we may easily judge with what design the matter was so Ordered: But if we must take the things as they are, and make the best we can of them, we may certainly assure our selves that their Hi. and Mi. will not shorten the time, but will allow their Friends as large a Term as their Enemies have allowed them: and that they will not precipitate themselves into such resolutions as the events that half a day may produce, may likely make them repent of their forwardness in taking up
<PB N="19" REF="16"/> But above all things his Majesty aforementioned, and his said Ambassador Extraordinary, in his name and on his behalf doth most earnestly entreat their Excellencies the Ambassadors Extraordinary of their Highnesses, that they will interpose to the ut∣most of their power, and make use of the credit that they have with the States General their Masters, to prevent their putting themselves out of all possibility of doing any thing for those that have done all for them (which power our Enemies reserved to themselves, for the sakes of such as have not contributed at all or but very inconside∣rably to the putting them into the condition in which now they are in) and that at least they will continue a readiness of mind to do what may be in their power, though they should happen to be destitute of such means as might enable them to do what they ought. Their Hi. and Mi. may be well assured that his Majesty will never reject their Councel and Advice in any thing whatsoever that may be reasonably thought to conduce to the publick Peace, in which if he could have any assu∣rance that he might find his security, he would immediately put an end to the War, and lay down his Arms as mildly, as he took them up generously, for the interest and at the request of his Allies.</P>

<HEAD>A Declaration on the behalf of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> upon the Sub∣ject of the Peace.</HEAD>
<P>THe Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipoten∣tiary of his Electoral Highness of <HI>Brandenburg;</HI> having seen what has been communicated to the Ministers of the Confederates at the <HI>Hague;</HI> to wit, that his Most Christian Majesty, upon the overture made to him by his Excellence the Sieur <HI>de Beverning</HI> Ambassador of the States General, hath granted to their Highnesses by a Declaration in writing, dated the first of <HI>June,</HI> at <HI>Wetteren,</HI> a Cessation of Arms for Six weeks, to commence from the first of <HI>July</HI> next, to the end that in the mean time they may confer with their Allies, and obtain their consent to the Peace, upon condition that their Highnesses would promise his Most Christian Majesty, in case they shall not be able during the said Truce to perswade their Allies to accept of the Terms which <HI>France</HI> had offered, that then they should no longer assist them against him or his Allies, during the present War: To which Declaration the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> has Order to expect their Highnesses answer to the end of this Month; hath not failed to acquaint his Electoral Highness his Master with the Contents of that Declaration, and to require his Order therein, which he now waits for. But in the mean time he thinks himself obliged to say beforehand, that his Electoral Highness having always reposed great confidence in the Sincerity, Integrity, and Justice of their Highnesses, the States General of
<PB N="21" REF="17"/> the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> as those that have been his an∣cient Friends and Confederates, and whose interests are in many respects the same with his own, assur∣eth himself that their Highnesses will not make any promise to his Most Christian Majesty, that shall at all interfere with their Alliances, or be prejudicial to his Electoral Highness, who hath not spared his own Estates, nor his Blood, to save their Countrey from utter ruine and destruction, with which it was threatned when three whole Provinces were torn from it though since by God's great mercy they have been reunited. Besides, his Ele∣ctoral Highness promiseth himself that their Hi. and Mi. will be so reasonable, since even his Most Christian Majesty hath been willing to allow them the whole month of <HI>June</HI> to acquaint the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> with what they shall think fit to resolve upon his said Declaration, as not to anticipate the Term to the prejudice of his Electoral Highness, but will allow him a con∣venient time for mature deliberation, and the dis∣patching of such Order as shall be necessary to his Ministers here and elsewhere. His Electoral High∣ness takes it likewise for granted, that their Hi. and Mi. will never come to a Treaty, much less conclude any thing whatsoever with <HI>France,</HI> without first procuring for his Electoral Highness the satisfaction promised him in the 14 and 24 Ar∣ticle of their Alliance, and without reserving the same Liberty to themselves with relation to their Allies, which his Most Christian Majesty might or should reserve in favour of his; Especially since it is evident, that his Electoral Highness did not engage in this War out of an <HI>airiness of mind,</HI> but for the safety of the Low Countreys, the
<PB N="22" REF="18"/> preservation of his own Estates, and to secure himself against the injuries and attempts of others, and that he hath not been more desirous of any thing since the first beginning of this War, than of a firm and sure Peace upon reasonable Terms. And that he will always take in good part the good offices that shall be used to attain it, and that he will make appear as well his moderation with relation to the Terms and Conditions of it, as his due consideration of the reasons and ne∣cessities alledged by their High and Mighty for a Peace. Provided things may be so ordered, that he may obtain his ends, which are no other than the safety of the publick, and that of his own Countrey. This is what the said Ambassador hath thought fit to represent by this writing to their Excellencies, the Ambassadors and Plenipotentiaries of their High and Mighty that are here present, desiring them not onely to recommend the Contents thereof to their Lords and Masters, to the end they may make their joynt Reflections, when they shall come to deliberate upon a matter of so great im∣portance, but also to support it as much in them lies by their own credit and wise conduct. <HI>Given at</HI> Nimeguen <HI>the</HI> 10th <HI>day of</HI> June, 1678.</P>

<HEAD>A Declaration on behalf of the Emperor.</HEAD>
<P>THe Ambassadors of his Imperial Majesty being advertised, that the States General of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> will shortly meet, to consult upon the Declaration which his Most Christian Majesty delivered in writing to their Ambassador
<PB N="23" REF="18"/> Extraordinary Monsieur <HI>de Beverning,</HI> in the Camp at the Bourg of <HI>Wetteren</HI> on the first day of this present month, do promise themselves assured∣ly from the eminent Wisdom, Integrity, and Justice of the said States General, upon which founda∣tions their Common-wealth has hitherto stood and continued in a flourishing condition, that they will not upon any pretence whatsoever act contrary to the Faith of their Alliances, or prejudicial to his Imperial Majesty, the Empire, and the rest of the Confederates, who have allready engaged them∣selves as well in the dangers, and expences of this long and Bloody War, not onely for their own common safety, to the end they might thereby deliver these <HI>United Provinces,</HI> together with the Publick, from utter ruine and destruction. It is needless to put them in mind of what hath for∣merly passed; this is evident, that the Confede∣rates have to do with an Enemy, who as he is hard enough for them all, cannot but be terrible to any one of them apart. Perhaps some Pro∣vinces may reap a present advantage, but in lieu thereof, all those that are near must inevitably fall under his yoke, and be destroyed. There are so many instances in Histories how dangerous the neighbourhood of <HI>France</HI> is, that it hath given occasion to a Proverb. This the States themselves have found by experience in this very War, when the Bar of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands</HI> was stronger. What will they do now that those Bars are almost broken down, and they shall have separated them∣selves, as the <HI>French</HI> earnestly press them to do, from the rest of the Confederates? Then their safety must solely depend upon the sincerity and moderation of the <HI>French.</HI> His Imperial Majesty
<PB N="24" REF="19"/> undertook the War together with the rest of the Confederates for their common safety, for the de∣fence of the Empire, and particularly that of these Provinces: he hath carried it on hitherto, not for his own private interest, but in such place and manner as was thought best good for the publick: And he is yet willing, if the Confederates please, to continue it in conjunction with them, and will be ready to lay down his Arms, when that shall make more for the Common interest. And when∣ever he shall make a Peace, he will have the same regard to the circumstances of the <HI>United Provin∣ces</HI> and of all the <HI>Low Conntreys,</HI> which he has appeared hitherto to have had in the undortaking and carrying on the War.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> has proposed some condi∣tions of Peace, but in such a manner as if he were giving Laws to us. He will not suffer us to Treat with him <HI>concerning them.</HI> Which to be so re∣ceived by the Emperor, the Empire and the Con∣federates, is not only inconsistent with their Ho∣nour, Safety and Interest, contrary to the very na∣ture of the thing it self. Besides which no speci∣fication at all is made in these conditions, what sa∣tisfaction it is in particular, the <HI>French</HI> would have stipulated in behalf of <HI>Sweden,</HI> so it is but too evident they are far from any intentions of Peace, since they will not so much as treat concerning it, according to those Forms and Methods which are observed betwixt Soveraign Princes and Estates, and are grounded upon the Law of Nations. It is not a Peace that <HI>France</HI> aims at, but a division amongst the Confederates: that conquest may be the more easie, when he shall have to do with them apart: if there be any urgent reason or
<PB N="25" REF="19"/> necessity of making a Peace, the Emperor is willing to do it forthwith upon such terms as will be neither dishonourable nor prejuaical to <HI>France,</HI> and manifest to the whole World his moderation, according to his High Function; and that although he has great regard to the safety of the Empire, yet that he prefers the common safety and the preservation of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> and of all the <HI>Low Countreys</HI> before any particular interests of his own. This will be made apparent when∣ever a Peace shall be treated of, and the States General shall employ their offices for it, which will be always acceptable to his Imperial Majesty, which being so, it cannot without injury to the constancy, prudence, and integrity of the States General be prefumed that they will upon any rash resolution abandon their most faithful Confederate, and there∣by expose them to manifest danger. They have Twenty days time yet before the end of this month to resolve in. But all our interests, our common liberty, and the safety of all the Confederates is now at stake. The enemy endeavours to preci∣pitate their resolutions, because he is their ene∣my, and would lead them to a precipice: the Con∣federates Council is to proceed safely and deliberate∣ly, as being engaged in one and the same common cause with the States General, when once the Enemy shall observe that the States resolve to Treat se∣parately, <HI>France</HI> will obtain what is desired, the general Peace will be desperate, which otherwise might have been expected, if all the Confederates would have made appear to the common Enemy their unanimous constancy and moderation. Let the States General therefore represent speedily and seriously to the Ambassadors of his Most Christian
<PB N="26" REF="20"/> Majesty, that it is that they hinder the restoring of Peace to Christendom, in that they deny the Con∣federates liberty to Treat about those matters with∣out which there can be no Peace: the Ambassadors of his Imperial Majesty do hereby oblige them∣selves to represent the whole matter that the mo∣tives and necessiries which induced the States Ge∣neral to chuse even a disadvantageous Peace, ra∣ther than the continuance of the War, are not at all displeasing to his Imperial Majesty, who will be ready to comply therewith, and to concur with them as far as in him lies, to endeavour a Peace, so as the safety of the Empire be in some degree provided for; and that he will jointly consult with the States General and the other Confederates, by what way and means the same may be establish∣ed and rendred secure.</P>
<P>And as the Imperial Ministers have thought it their duty to remonstrate these things to the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the High and Mighty Lords, the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> so they do earnestly beseech and intreat them seriously to weigh of how great importance this matter is: and to support it with their offices and recommendation, in which they will do a thing becoming themselves, glorious and beneficial to their Countrey, desired by the Confederates and every one else that loves the publick safety and security, and which will be trans∣mitted to posterity, to their immortal praise and merit.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Letter from the States General of the</HI> United Provinces <HI>to the King, written at the</HI> Hague <HI>the 22th of</HI> June, 1678.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was with an equal mixture of Joy and Reve∣rence, that we understood by your Majesties answer of the first of this instant, from your Camp at <HI>Wetteren,</HI> which the <HI>Sieur De Beverning</HI> deli∣vered us, the reality of your Majesties intentions to put an end to the present war: to which end, your Majesty was pleased to allow us all this month, to induce our Allies to accept the Peace upon the terms which your Majesty hath proposed: to which unfeigned purpose of your Majesties, that we might answer with the like sincerity on our parts, and give your Majesty all the satisfaction we possibly could, we have left nothing undone to in∣duce our Allies to a complyance: and though we could not promise our selves that they would joyn with us in making a peace upon those terms, yet we have given orders to our Ambassadors at <HI>Nime∣guen,</HI> to conclude and Sign the Treaty of Peace with your Majesties Ambassadors and Plenipoten∣tiaries, and such of the Confederates as should be dispos'd to come into it before the end of this month. In the mean while, having some assurance that his Catholick Majesty will joyn with us in accepting the Peace, we make it our request that your Mejesty will be pleased to give necessary orders to surcease all acts of hostility by Land, and to cause such of your Mejesties Forces as are in his Coun∣try,
<PB N="28" REF="21"/> to retire about the end of this month, and that your Majesty will be pleased to forbid your Majesties Men of War and Privateers, to set upon any such Ships belonging to this State, or any of our Sub∣jects, as are imployed about the Fishing-Trade, and to give them Passports and letters of Safe-conduct, that they may follow their imployment with safety; accordingly we shall be willing to do on our part; hoping and promising our selves, that this will con∣duce to the good both of your Majesties Subjects and our own, and to the encreasing the good un∣derstanding, which ought to be firmly established by the Peace. To conclude, We pray God,</P>
<P>SIR,</P>

<HEAD>The King's Answer to the Letter of the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> written from <HI>St. Germain</HI> the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> 1678.</HEAD>
<P>Most Dear, Great Friends, Allies, and Confederates,</P>
<P><HI>You will easily judge, after all that we have done toward the Facilitating of a Peace, that we were very well satisfied to understand by</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="21"/> <HI>your Letter, that before the time which we had agreed to allow for a Cessation of Arms, you had sent instructions to your Plenipotentiary Ambassa∣dor at</HI> Nemiguen, <HI>to Sign the Treaty of Peace be∣fore the end of this month. And by the assurance which you give us, that at the same time those of the Catholick King will accept of it, we see your inclinations are well disposed toward the general quiet of</HI> Europe. <HI>We Promise our selves likewise that it cannot be long retarded by those of your Allies, that hitherto, notwithstanding all the good Offices which you have done towards it, re∣fuse to joyn with you in the procuring so great a good and so universally desired. In the mean time as the Peace, which we doubt not but will immedi∣ately be concluded with you at</HI> Nimeguen, <HI>since we have your word for it, puts us into a condition of rendring you our entire affection, of which we take delight in letting you feel the effects, we are willing at your desire from hence forward to surcease all acts of hostility to the</HI> Low Countreys, <HI>and whatever obstruction our Men of War, or Privateers may give to your Commerce. Common usage would re∣quire, that things should continue in the same posture they now are, till the Peace were fully con∣summated by exchange of the Ratifications and publication of Treaties: but without staying till they, that are now to be Signed betwixt our Plenipotentiaries Ambassadors at</HI> Nimeguen, <HI>those of the Catholick King and yours, shall be come to our hands; out of our respect to you, we will send or∣der immediately to the Duke of</HI> Luxemburg, <HI>to retire our Army from about</HI> Brussells <HI>into that part of the Country, that is now under our subjection. We will charge him to concert upon this subject</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="22"/> <HI>with the Duke</HI> De Villa Hermosa, <HI>and even with your Envoy there, and to settle some regulation for those Officers to be under, that shall command the Troops which we are obliged to leave about</HI> Mons, <HI>and on what manner they may continue without any acts of hostility on either side, but in a good understanding, and so as the country may be open, till the Ratifications are exchanged with</HI> Spain. <HI>Having thus quieted all things at Land, we are willing at your instance to do the same by Sea. The Treaty which Our Ambassadors must Sign with Yours, will ascertain the Places and Times, within which what ever shall be taken on either side, shall be deemed lawful Prize. But for the present security of such Vessels as shall Sail out of your Ports, whether for Trade, or Fishing, we think good to send a competent number of Pass∣ports to our Ambassadors at</HI> Nimeguen, <HI>whom we will order to deliver them to Yours, as there shall be occasion. They shall do the same to the Am∣bassador of</HI> Spain. <HI>But upon this condition, that when the Ambassador of the Catholick King and your Ambassador shall receive them, they shall be obliged at the same time to put into my Ambassa∣dors hands such quantities of Passports as they shall demand of them. We are well satisfied in not suf∣fering more tedious forms, though ordinarily ob∣served in Treaties of Peace, to impair the benefit that ought to accrew to your people by this, and in letting them tast the sweetness of Peace from this very time, and in procuring the same ease to those of the Catholick King, for your Sakes. You may see by this new testimony of our Friendship, that we retain the same good disposition towards your Com∣mon-Wealth, which our Predecessors have had, who</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="22"/> <HI>did so much toward the Raising of it, and which we hope will help to render it more happy and flourishing for the future. We pray God to take you, Most Dear, Great Friends, Allies and Confe∣derates, into his Holy Protection.</HI> Written at <HI>St. Germain in Laye,</HI> the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> 1678.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Extract of the Resolution of their Lordships the States of</HI> Holland, <HI>and</HI> Friesland, <HI>at their meeting on the 11th of</HI> July, 1678.</HEAD>
<P>THe Pensionary <HI>Fagel</HI> has shown to the Assem∣bly a Letter of the <HI>10th</HI> of this instant, from the Ambassador Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiary at the Treaty of Peace at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> written to him∣self, importing that the Ambassadours of <HI>France</HI> have declared to them, that the King their Master is not minded to Evacuate <HI>Mastricht,</HI> nor the other places of the Bar, till a compleat satisfaction be made to the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI> Where, upon deliberation, we have thought fit that this matter be put in as from the States aforesaid to the States General, to the end that answer may be returned to the Ambassadors of the States: that it could not be believed nor expected that his Most Christian Majesty would have made the least difficulty in the
<PB N="32" REF="23"/> Evacuation of those places, after the Peace Signed, concluded and ratified betwixt his Most Christian Majesty and <HI>Spain</HI> and this State: and that the States could not foresee that there would arise any new obstructions or difficulties on his Most Christian Majesti's part, after he had given them him∣self and by his Ministers so many assurances of his unfeigned inclinations not only to a general Peace, but particularly to a Peace with this State.</P>
<P>It is very true, that when his Mejesty compos'd a general platform for us to take our measures by, it was put down in the first Article, that his Majesty would never listen to any Terms of Peace, other than such as should give the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> full and compleat satisfaction: and his Majesty might with good reason insrst upon it, and take care to have it effected, if we had been able to dispose the Confederates to accept the conditions of that Project. But since the Confederates did not think it their interests to make Peace upon those terms, as the States foresaw at first they would not, and that his Catholick Majesty would make some scruple, as the Ambassadors of the State intimated to those of <HI>France,</HI> desiring them to let them know what places the King their Master intended should make the Bar in the <HI>Spanish Netherlands:</HI> and his Most Christian Majesty was pleased to assure the States by a Letter of the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> written from his Camp, in case his Catholick Majesty should refuse the Peace upon the said Terms, and that the States would conclude their Treaty, and oblige themselves to remain neuters, that then his Majesty would always be willing to grant to <HI>Spain</HI> the conditions of the Project, and promised not to lay Siege to any place in the <HI>Spanish Nether∣lands</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="23"/> during the whole. War without making any mention of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or the rest of the Confede∣rates: Whereupon their Lordships the States con∣fiding in the King's Word, did their duty for the inducing his Catholick Majesty to accept of those conditions, and laboured on the otherside to the utmost of their power to perswade the rest of the Confederates also; with which they acquainted his Majesty, by Monsieur <HI>de Beverning</HI> their Am∣bassador, declaring that for their own parts they accepted of his Majesties Terms; and desiring his Majesty that he would be pleased to agree to a Truce for Six weeks, that they might labour with their Allies, and get them to consent to a general Peace, and that his Majesty was pleased to agree to such a Truce for Six months, to begin from the first of <HI>July,</HI> and as himself wrote from his Camp at <HI>Wetter,</HI> the first of <HI>June,</HI> upon the same foot that the Truce in 1668 was agreed betwixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> upon condition that the States would engage themselves, in case they should not be able in Six weeks time to perswade their Allies to admit of the conditions, then not to assist their said Allies directly nor indirectly against his Majesty or his Allies during the War, and that in requital thereof his Majesty would renew the engagements which he made in his Letter of the <HI>18th.</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> both concerning the conditions to be granted to his Catholick Majesty, and the securing of the places in the <HI>Low Countreys:</HI> leaving the Duke of <HI>Lux∣emburg</HI> near <HI>Brussels</HI> to stay to the end of <HI>June</HI> for an answer, with Order not to attack any Place during that time; and without making any alteration in the said conditions, or any mention either of the Allies of this State, or of giving
<PB N="34" REF="24"/> satisfaction to the King of <HI>Sweden:</HI> that the States acting candidly, and being ready on their part to perfect that Treaty, and having induced his Ca∣tholick Majesty to accept it also, as they advised his Most Christian Majesty by their Letter of the <HI>22th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> assuring him that they had given Order to their Ambassador, to conclude a Peace before the end of that month, with such of the Confederates as would joyn with them in it, without so much as staying for the Truee, which was to begin on the first of <HI>July;</HI> and that his Majesty by his Letter of the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> declared himself to be extreamly well satisfied therewith: and was so far from obliging the States or his Catholick Ma∣jesty to make any satisfaction to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> that he expressed in the same Letter, that he observ'd in the proceedings of the States a good inclination to the general Peace of <HI>Europe:</HI> and he perswaded himself it would not be long de∣lay'd by such of the Allies as hitherto had not been able to help forward so great a good: that his Majesty doubted not but the Peace would be concluded by his Ambassadors, and should take delight in making this State sensible of its effects, and in forbearing all acts of hosility in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> and obstructions to Commerce by Sea, though it be customary to let things continue in the same condition, till the Peace be Ratified by exchange of Ratifications, and publishing of Trea∣ties; without suspending the effects of the Peace upon any Treaty with the Confederates, or any satisfaction to be made to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> That the States may say with good reason, that his Most Christian Majesty is the cause why the Peace is not concluded, and not they: since his Majesty
<PB N="35" REF="24"/> advances new Conditions, which never were propo∣sed to themselves, nor to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> it never having been pretended, that the Peace, or its effects, should depend upon the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI> receiving satisfaction, but onely upon the States standing Neuter, in relation to his Majesty and his Allies, against those that should reject the Condi∣tions of the Project. So that it is evident, that the most Christian King hath promised to restore those Places to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to this State; and that himself hath directed to have the Treaty perfected, by Exchanging the Ratifications, and publishing it: That the States pretend to no new matter concerning the said Evacuation: That the things of no small concern to the Catholick King, and to this State, who cannot arrive at peace and quiet, in getting rid of the War, if at the same time they continue depriv'd of the effects of Peace; much less if they must be sent back, and made to depend upon the chances of War betwixt other Parties; which who knows when it will end in a satisfaction, that is not limited to any thing in particular? Especially considering, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> contimes an Enemy to this State, without giving order to put an end to the differences that are, and that daily grow betwixt him and it; and doth perpetually molest the Inhabitants of this State, contrary to the Treaty of Commerce made with him.</P>
<P>That order be given to the Ambassadors and Plenipotentiaries of this State, to enquire of the Ambassadors of the most Christian King, in a friend∣ly and loving manner, without the least sharpness, whether the King their Master be resolved to persist in his demand, and to advise the Estates as soon as
<PB N="36" REF="25"/> may be, that they may take proper measures, and conser with the Ministers of the Confederates, to know whether they can either come to a resolution to accept the Peace upon the terms offered, or find means, if there shall be occasion, to make a more vigorous opposition to their Enemies, than here∣tofore.</P>

<HEAD>A Memorial of the <HI>French</HI> Ambas∣sadors, delivered the 17. <HI>July,</HI> 1678. to the Ambassadors of the States Gene∣ral of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> of the <HI>Low-Countreys.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THe Ambassadors of</HI> France <HI>being troubled to see, that the difficulties arisen concerning the time for the Evacuation of the places, which the King their Master is willing to restore, give occa∣sion to those that are averse to the Peace, to render the sincerity of his Majesties intentions suspected, have thought it their duty to manifest the same to the Ambassadors of the States General by this Me∣morial.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And to justifie the Reasons his Majesty hath, not to quit those Places, until</HI> Sweden <HI>is entirely satis∣fied, it will be sufficient to go no higher than the beginning of the Negotiation, by which the Peace is at present so far advanced. And we may say, that the same are grounded on the Conditions, pro∣posed in his Majesties name by the said Ambassadors of</HI> France, <HI>since they have been all of them accepted,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="25"/> <HI>first, by</HI> Holland, <HI>and not long after by</HI> Spain. <HI>We may farther say, that when the States General, in consequence of the Letters his Majesty writ unto them the</HI> 18th. <HI>of</HI> May <HI>last, and of the Memorial delivered the first of</HI> June <HI>to Monsieur</HI> de Beverning; <HI>as also of the message of the Sieur</HI> de Lanoy <HI>to his Majesty, and the Letter he presented unto him on the part of the States, declared, they were ready to sign the Treaty on those Conditions, they obliged themselves to the execution of that which relates to</HI> Sweden, <HI>it being the first of all of them. And as they were all joyned together, so they ought not to be se∣parated in the meaning of the said States General, to cause his Majesty to consent unto them; and he doubts not at all, that since he made but one thing of his own Interest and that of his Allies, their mean∣ing was not, but that he should procure both the one and the other.</HI></P>
<P><HI>His Majesty had likewise reason to hope, that by advantaging both them and</HI> Spain, <HI>in being willing to quit so many important Places for the sake of</HI> Sweden, <HI>they would have joyned with him to procure the re∣establishment of that Crown; and though his Majesty hath not desired them to unite their Forces to his, to put that Crown in possession of the Places it hath lost; yet they ought not to hinder him from making use of those Means that are in his power, for the effectual executing of a Condition, to which they have so solemnly consented. They know well, that his Majesty hath no other effectual means, whereby to contribute to the re-establishment of the King of</HI> Sweden <HI>in</HI> Pomerania <HI>and the Dutchy of</HI> Bremen, <HI>than by making War upon the Elector of</HI> Brandenburg, <HI>and the Princes that are possessed of the Estates of that Crown; and they know as well,</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="26"/> <HI>that in order to his acting against those Princes, his Majesty will have occasion for those Places he now possesses, as being equally useful for the passage of his Armies, as for erecting Magazins there for them. Lastly, they cannot look upon the Peace which his Majesty is willing to make, otherwise than as one and the same Treaty, as well for himself as his Allies: nor think it strange, if he take all necessary Cautions, to see all the Conditions of it performed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This practise is conformable to that of all Trea∣ties; and for an example might be alledged the pra∣ctise of that of the</HI> Pyrenaeans, <HI>in which Treaty, the Places his Majesty was to restore to the Catholick King, were evacuated proportionably as he on his side executed the Conditions he had agreed to; and</HI> Verceil, <HI>which the Catholick King was to surrender to the Duke of</HI> Savoy, <HI>was restored in the same manner: for that the Interests of his Majesty and his Ally were not to be separated. In like manner, the States General being obliged to look upon as one and the same convention, the Conditions offered by his Majesty, and accepted of by them at</HI> Nimeguen, <HI>they ought to do what lies in them, that the same be exe∣cuted all together, as well with relation to his Ma∣jesty as to</HI> Sweden.</P>
<P><HI>And his Majesty hath the greater reason to be∣lieve they would concur with him in so just a thing, for that in the Project of the Treaty, which their Ambassador delivered to those of</HI> France, <HI>there is no mention made therein of the time of the Restitu∣tion of the Places. This silence shows, that they did not pretend to it, till all the conditions that they had accepted should be executed, and that therefore they would make the less difficulty, that</HI> Maestricht <HI>re∣mained in the hands of his Majesty, in order to</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="26"/> <HI>oblige the Enemies of</HI> Sweden <HI>to Peace, for that the said States General were by their Treaty to deliver that Place unto</HI> Spain.</P>
<P><HI>And to evidence yet further to the States Gene∣ral, how sincerely his Majesty intended, after the many paces he made to give Peace to</HI> Europe, <HI>to restore unto them his first Friendship, to promote the advantage they might receive from it, and to de∣sist from all future Enterprises upon the</HI> Low-Countreys; <HI>they need but reflect upon his Majesties Conduct, since they declared by the Letter, which the Sieur</HI> de Lanoy <HI>delivered to his Majesty, that they would sign the Peace before the end of</HI> June, <HI>and that</HI> Spain <HI>would likewise sign it at the same time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They may have observed, how at their entreaty, without expecting the Exchange of the Ratificati∣ons, his Majesty gave order to his Army to with∣draw from the Neighbourhood of</HI> Brussels: <HI>How he was ready to open again the free Commerce and Na∣vigation, by the Passports he allowed his Ambas∣sadors to Exchange: How he offered to take mea∣sures with them about the manner how his Troops should live near</HI> Mons, <HI>and about the means for the subsistance of that City, till the exchange of the Rati∣fications: How for the ease of the</HI> Low-Countreys, <HI>and the speedy obliging the Elector of</HI> Brandenburg <HI>to consent to the Peace, his Majesty hath re-inforced the Mareschal</HI> de Schomberg <HI>with a considerable De∣tachment of his Army in</HI> Flanders, <HI>which he hath al∣ready caused to march into</HI> Germany, <HI>and was up∣on the point of ordering others to follow them. All which Conduct doth sufficiently show, that his Majesty looking upon the Peace with</HI> Spain <HI>as certain, his intention onely was to employ his Forces</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="27"/> <HI>against the Elector of</HI> Brandenburg, <HI>thereby to oblige him to make his Peace with</HI> Sweden.</P>
<P><HI>But because his Majesty observes, by the Reports which his Enemies spread abroad, that they endeavour to render the fidelity of his words suspected, and would make it believed, That when by the Peace he had broken the measures of</HI> Spain <HI>and</HI> Holland <HI>for the War, he wouldmake use of the Places he should retain, to act with more, advantage against the</HI> Low-Countreys; <HI>his Majesty is very desirous, as much as in him lieth, to cure them of these vain apprehensions. The onely aim he has, in what he insists upon, is to procure the satisfaction of</HI> Sweden; <HI>and he is willing to believe, that the States Ge∣neral have always the same intention; and there∣fore he is ready to use all such means, in conjun∣ction with them, as they shall think fit to be effe∣ctual to that end, either by obliging themselves to restore that Crown to th Places and Countreys it has lost, or by disposing its Enemies to surrender them; provided they give his Majesty full secu∣rity of its re-establishment. His Majesty will wil∣lingly embrace such Expedients as they shall propose unto him, and shall be esteemed most speedy and ef∣fectual to make the Peace General. And for the treating of this business, they may either discuss it with the said Ambassadors of</HI> France <HI>at</HI> Nimeguen, <HI>or appoint some Minister to repair to his Majesty, or send Deputies to the Frontiers of</HI> Flanders <HI>and</HI> Ghent, <HI>as nearest to their Countreys, to confer there∣upon with those to whom his Majesty shall entrust the care of it. His Majesty will rest satisfied, if they can but agree upon a safe, speedy, and certain way of procuring the re∣establishment of</HI> Sweden.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="27"/>
<P><HI>The said Ambassadors of</HI> France <HI>are perswaded, that the said Ambassadors of the States General, and all indifferent men, will be equally convinced, as well of the Right his Majesty hath to demand the Execution of a Condition so positively accepted, as of procuring the same by such means as are in his power, unless the States General shall adjust others with him, to obtain it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The long time his Majesty hath lost in</HI> Flanders <HI>since the 18th. of May, that he writ unto the said States, doth also shew, how sincerely he desired the Peace. Considering the Condition in which his Majesty and his Enemies then were, every body will easily believe, that onely the desire of giving Peace to</HI> Europe, <HI>was capable of making him loose so favourable a Conjuncture: And it is from the same desire, that he is still disposed to admit of Pro∣positions, that may secure the entire satisfaction of</HI> Sweden, <HI>and procure the Tranquility, which Chri∣stendom expects from this Assembly.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>A Memorial delivered to the Ple∣nipotentiaries of</HI> France, <HI>by the Plenipo∣tentiaries of</HI> Holland, July <HI>the 26th.</HI> 1678.</HEAD>
<P>THe Ambassadors Extraordinary, and Plenipoten∣tiaries of their Lordships, the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> having received from the hands of the Lords Ambassadors of <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>11th.</HI> instant, a Memorial, whereby they pretend to justifie the particular of the Retension of the
<PB N="43" REF="28"/> Places, the Restitution whereof were promised by his most Christian Majesty; and wherein, at the same time, they invite their Lordships to enter into some way with his Majesty, whereby they might draw and assure a perfect Satisfaction to the King of <HI>Swedes,</HI> are obliged by express order from their Lords and Masters, to represent to their Ex∣cellencies, That their Lordships making a due reflection upon the method of his Majesties pro∣ceedings to terminate the present War; and up∣on the advantagious expressions, whereby he has particularly declared himself upon their account; they cannot entertain so much as a thought, that he would at present delay the accomplishment and conclusion by the said Retension; being fully per∣swaded, that such kind of obstructions cannot pro∣ceed from so generous a Soul as his Majesties, but rather from the perswasion of those who are averse to a Peace. They strongly possess themselves with this perswaasion, that they cannot lay a more solid Basis for their justification, than to give an ingenuous account of the beginning and progress of this Affair.</P>
<P>Tis notorious, that the Lords the States Gene∣ral have done their utmost endeavours, without intermission, to determine this present War by a General Peace, wherein all Parties Interested might have had that satisfaction which they have so passi∣onately desired, as might have disposed all Per∣sons whatsoever thereunto. But such was their misfortune, that the pretences of the other Allies being far different, and very far from it, and his most Christian Majesty having caused his Ambassadors at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> to propose those Con∣ditions, which might and ought to serve as a Plat∣form
<PB N="42" REF="28"/> to a general Peace; and upon that conside∣ration, explaining himself, that it was the last point that he could possibly dispence with; and hereupon his Enemies might make choice either of Peace or War, without being obliged, after the <HI>10th.</HI> of this present <HI>May.</HI> And the Lords the States General taking into their consideration, that the major part of the said proposed Conditions, did concern their puissant Allies, did carefully explain themselves, that they might find out some Expe∣dients, and have endeavoured to dispose of Affairs so, as that they might enter upon a Negotiation according to the said Platform, to see what the Parties concerned at design'd but to their great regret, they have been inform'd, That it was not at all his Majesties intention to cause a Treaty, or to admit any debate upon the Conditions proposed; but that the Potent Parties, that were at War, ought simply to declare themselves before the Term of the <HI>10th.</HI> of <HI>May</HI> was expired, whether or no they would subscribe the said Conditions. Whereupon their Lordships have laboured continually with the Ministers of their Allies, to understand their Sentiments. But they excusing themselves, upon the small time allotted for this great Affair, and want of Order from their Masters, wherewith they could not possibly be instructed before the Expi∣ration of the term; therefore their Highnesses not being able to assure themselves of the intentions of their powerful Allies, especially the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in regard of the Acceptation or Refusal of the said Conditions: And considering, that the Stop proposed by his most Christian Majesty, must also give them particular satisfaction, have applied their farther endeavours to inform themselves, how
<PB N="44" REF="29"/> this stop should be considered, in case the King of <HI>Spain</HI> should refuse to accept the said Condi∣tions; and thereupon his Most Christian Majesty hath been so kind as to honour them with a Letter written from his Camp. <HI>May</HI> the <HI>18th:</HI> and to ac∣quaint them, that if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> denied to accept of the Peace, and they judged it pro∣per to conclude a Peace with him, on the Condi∣tions proposed upon their account, and that they would engage to remain Neuter, during the whole course of this War: His Majesty in such Cases, would upon their consideration, grant the said King of <HI>Spain</HI> the same Conditions, which he was at liberty to accept of at this present, and that during that time, he would not attack any place in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> and if my Lords the States General, in order to the advancement of this Ne∣gotiation, should find it convenient to send Depu∣ties to him, that they would find his Majesty in the neighbourhood of <HI>Ghent,</HI> till the <HI>25th.</HI> of the said month, and under the same dispositions.</P>
<P>Farthermore, the Lords of the States General, having declared before the <HI>30th.</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> to the Lords, Ambassadors of <HI>France;</HI> that for their parts they were resolved to conclude a Peace with his Majesty, upon the Conditions proposed on their account, and having desired a convenient time, to the end that they might dispose their Allies to the same Peace, and after the Receipt of the aforesaid Letter from his Majesty, having de∣termined to send to him the Sieur <HI>Beverning,</HI> their Ambassador Extraordinary, to represent unto him, how earnestly they desired a general Peace, that they did accept of the Conditions offered, and that they desired his Majesty to grant them a Cessa∣tion
<PB N="45" REF="29"/> of Arms for Six weeks, that they might have time to discourse with their Allies, upon the affairs of Peace, and to gain their consent, for the conclusion of so great a Work. His Majesty was Graciously pleas'd to declare by his answer the first of <HI>June,</HI> dated in his Camp at <HI>Wetteren,</HI> that he did condescend to that Cessation, for the space of six weeks, as it was desired, to commence from the first of <HI>July,</HI> and the same according to the stipula∣tion between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain, Anno Dom.</HI> 1668. With this proviso, they should promise his Majesty that in case, during the said Cessation of Arms, they could not prevail with their Allies to accept of the Conditions offered, they would neither, di∣rectly nor indirectly assist them, against his Majesty or his Allies, during the continuance of this War: And upon this consideration his Majesty was willing to Render by way of exchange, the same engage∣ments that he had obliged himself unto, with them, in his said Letter of the <HI>18th.</HI> of <HI>May;</HI> as well in regard of the same Conditions, which he would be always inclinable to grant to <HI>Spain;</HI> as for the security of the Places in the <HI>Low Countreys.</HI> And to give them a larger Testimony thereof, his Majesty hath charged the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> General of his Forces, to attend their answer, during the month of <HI>June,</HI> in the neighbourhood of <HI>Brussels,</HI> with orders not to attack any place during that time.</P>
<P>That consequently, the States General, to give pregnant proof of the desire they have to conclude the War, and to testifie the Candour of their pre∣ceedings, would not wait till the expiration of the month of <HI>June,</HI> much less make use of the said Cessation of Arms, which was to begin on the first
<PB N="46" REF="30"/> of <HI>July,</HI> as it was at their liberty to do: but from the <HI>22th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> have assured his Majesty by their Letter, that though they had laboured very strenuously with their Allies, to dispose them to the said Peace, and that they could not be satisfied that all would concur therein; yet they had ordered their Ambassadors at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> to Conclude and Sign the Troaty, with his Majesties Ambassadors, together with those of their Allies, who were wil∣ling to condescend thereunto; and that they were very certain, his Majesty the King of <HI>Spain</HI> would also accept of the Peace, upon the Conditions pro∣pos'd on his account, And his Most Christian Ma∣jesty has been so gracious as to give them an an∣swer, by Letter dated the <HI>30th.</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> that he understood, with satisfaction, by their said Let∣ter, that without expecting the time which he had granted them for a Cessation of Arms, they had sent the said Orders to their Ambassadors, to Sign the Treaty of Peace, before the end of <HI>June,</HI> and that the assurance they gave his Majesty, that those of the <HI>Spanish</HI> King would accept of them at the same time, did give him to understand, that there were very favourable inclinations for the quiet of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and that likewise his Majesty did perswade himself, that he could not be long re∣tarded by their Allies; who till this very hour, what instances soever they had made, had refused to give their Concurrence to so great a Benefit, and so Universally desired.</P>
<P>His Majesty Declaring farther, that though the us∣ual Custom in such Cases requires, that things should continue in the same condition they are in, till the Peace be absolutely Consummated by an exchange of Ratifications, and a publication of the Treaties;
<PB N="47" REF="30"/> that yet upon their account, he had sent his im∣mediate Orders to the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> to withdraw his Army from the adjacent parts of <HI>Brussels,</HI> and March them into his own Countreys; and that he Charged the said Duke, for this pur∣pose, to agree with the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa,</HI> as also their Envoys with him, about the Conduct that should be among the Officers that were to Com∣mand the Troops, which his Majesty was obliged to leave in the places about the Town of <HI>Mons;</HI> as also how they should live of one side as well as the other, without Hostility in a good understand∣ing, and with Liberty in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> till the Exchange of the Ratisications with <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>From all this, it evidently follows, that the Intentions, as well of his Majesty as the Lords the States General, have been from the beginning, to make a General Peace, upon such Conditions as all the Allies might have agreed unto; and being very uncertain, whether the said Allies would re∣gulate themselves by the Conditions his Majesty had proposed, and having Explained himself, that he would admit of no Alteration, their Lordships have desired an Explanation of his Majesties Intentions toward them, and of the Conditions that concerned them, and have had the good fortune to receive In∣structions, not only from the mouth of his Am∣bassadors, but also by two Letters from his Majesty himself; that in respect to them, they should en∣joy the said Conditions, and particularly those re∣lating to the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> though his Ca∣tholick Majesty, or any other of his Allies should obstruct the Peace, upon condition, that when they Conclude the Treaty, they should not directly. not indirectly Assist their Allies, against his Majesty or
<PB N="48" REF="31"/> his Allies whilst the War should continue; by which it is manifestly apparent, that it has been no ways his Majesties intention to retard, or protract the Peace or the effects thereof by any means whatsoever: as to those that should, who would be ready, and in a condition to make a Conclusion, though some other persons should not as yet prove so; and to contract only, that those who should subscribe the Peace, should not assist directly nor indirectly those that would continue the War against his Majesty or his Allies. And thus it is altogether incredible that so Generous a soul as his Majesties, after such clear and Indisputable Declarations, as are contained in his Letters could entertain such a Sentiment; and certainly their Lordships the States General would be extremely surprised, if his Majesties Intentions should be found Conformable to the Expressions of the said <HI>Memorial</HI> it being a very Erroneous Position, that their Lordships the States General did ever De∣clare, that they found all the Conditions equitable which his Majesty had proposed, having never ex∣plained themselves, but in those things which re∣lated to their own particular interests, and having also demanded time to Dispose their Allies to what may farther be required.</P>
<P>Besides that, it is most certain, a Declaration of that Nature was never required of them; that even his Majesty himself having weighed the Scruple, which they were to be satisfied in, that all their Allies could not possibly be Inclined to accept of the Conditions proposed, did anticipate them, by his Declaration, that not withstanding all this, upon their own, as well as the King of <HI>Spains</HI> account, he would ever condescend to them, provided they would put a period to their Treaty upon the con∣ditions
<PB N="49" REF="31"/> that were offered, and hath given sufficient Testimony, that it was neither his own, nor the Intentions of the States General, that they should be obliged to the Loan or Payment of any other thing, but what concerned them particularly, or related to such of their Allies, as were ready to Concur with them in making a Peace; and that his Majesty as to those that should continue the War, would require only a Neutrality of them, having in no respect proposed or agreed to Second his Allies, and to afford them that Satisfaction they pretend to; which nevertheless, the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadors do now lay claim to in the forementioned Memorial, direct∣ly contrary to his Majesties Declarations, if the said Ambassadors would please to call to mind the An∣swer they gave at the Conference on the <HI>17th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> passed, when they openly clear'd themselves upon the point of the Conclusion and Signing of the Treaties, they must necessarily agree in this, that he hath been, and that they were ready to Sign with all those Allies, who would declare themselves to Condescend thereunto without any stipulation for the <HI>Swede,</HI> or any Delay on that account, having only recommended to them the Continuance of their endeavours with the Allies, with a promise that they would effect as much with their own Confede∣rates: being farther most certain, that during the whole Course; of the Negotiation they never in∣tended any thing as to the <HI>Swedish</HI> Interest; nay not when the Matter of the Restitution of the places, which should serve as a Bar, was Debated.</P>
<P>And it is somewhat surprizing, that the foresaid Ambassadors should positively affirm in the said Memorial, that his Majesty did never Condescend to the Restitution of Places to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="32"/> unless it were in Consideration of an equal Resti∣tution, which should be made to the King of <HI>Swedes</HI> Advantage, since the Original and the very words of the said Conditions do expresly import, that those Places ought to serve as a Boundary to the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> upon which the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the States General, and the other Neighbouring States of the said Countreys have so much insisted: and that his Most Christian Majesty would Surrender them with this Prospect, and on such Conditions, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> should yield up in Exchange all those Places, which are likewise specified in the said Conditions; and that the aforesaid Restitution to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> should also be one part of the Satisfaction due to their Lordships without any man∣ner of Limitation, nor be directly, nor indirectly tied to give any manner of Satisfaction to the <HI>Swedish</HI> King: and it is very Clear, that the <HI>French</HI> Ambas∣sadors are themselves Convinced of this, since that they confess in the said Memorial, that his Most Christian Majesty did not in the least pretend, that They, or the King of <HI>Spain</HI> ought to joyn their Forces with his, to Repossess the King of <HI>Swedes</HI> with those Territories and Places that he had lost, Ground∣ing it only upon the account of the Retention of them, in regard that in the Conditions of the Gene∣ral Peace, the <HI>Swede's</HI> Satisfaction is mentioned in the first Article; and that before all others; with∣out considering that this intire and full Satisfaction of the <HI>Swede,</HI> cannot by any means be Applicable to their Lordships, who had never conquer'd or carried any Place that belonged to that Crown; and that it is very Irregular to pretend to Charge them with a Restitution who never took any thing, and have no manner of Possession, that even they would
<PB N="51" REF="32"/> draw a Consequence from so General and Ambiguous a proposition to all particular Conditions, which in pursuance of that proposition are expressed by very different ways and Stipulations; no otherwise than if they would deduce the same Consequence from that which is after mentioned concerning the Princes of <HI>Strasburg</HI> and <HI>Fustemberg: viz,</HI> That their Inte∣rests ought to make up one of the first points of that Peace, it being however an Affair that concerns none of the <HI>Confederates,</HI> the Emperor excepted, and that particularly too. Nor besides have the Ambassadors considered, that his Majesty by his Letters of the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> and <HI>1st</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> did explain himself so clearly and so positively, that he was Content, provided the States General did on their part, Con∣clude and Sign the Peace, and that he would always agree to the Conditions profered to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> they only promising not to Assist their Allies that are willing to continue the War against his Majesty, or his Confederates: so that the Condi∣tions offered, as well to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as their Lordships ought to be performed, though the other Allies will not Concur in the making of a Peace; not only when the King of <HI>Swedes</HI> should be re-esta∣blished; and receive Satisfaction, but when they had promised the said Neutrality.</P>
<P>The Lords the States General desire servently and Cordially, that the War in the Northern parts should be ended by convenient means: but his Most Christian Majesty and the King of <HI>Swedes,</HI> not be∣ing able to Agree upon Conditions with the Allies of their Lordships they will look upon the Continuation of the War with great Dissatissaction; but yet in the interim they are apt to believe, that the <HI>French</HI> Am∣bassadors are mistaken, when they would Infer from
<PB N="52" REF="33"/> thence, That his most Christian Majesty might lawfully make use of the Territories and Places be∣longing to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and their State, to make a more advantageous War.</P>
<P>They call his Countreys and Territories their own, because that according to the Treaty of Peace, they ought to belong to them, by the same right as the other Lands and Provinces, which, be∣yond all controversie, appertain to them.</P>
<P>It is very certain, that the Countrey of his Electoral Highness of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> may be in∣fested, and also those belonging to the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> more commodiously by those Countreys which the States General at present possess; but as his most Christian Majesty did never pretend, and his Ambassadors would do ill to pretend, that his Majesty might lawfully make use of their Terri∣tories and Places to that purpose; nor can they pretend any more, that his Majesty can make use of those Places, which he hath engaged to re∣store, having reserv'd no such kind of Right to himself, nor any thing whatsoever in order to such a design; but onely the said Neutrality of the Parties contracting with him; it being observ∣able, that nothing in the world can be more oppo∣site to the Neutrality, than to grant one Party the power to employ those Territories and Places to infest and indemnisie the other Parties, nor more prejudicial to the Interests of their Lordships, than thereby to bring upon themselves the mischiefs and inconveniences of a War in their Neighbourhood, and even to their very Frontiers; so that in lieu of enjoying the sweetness and effects of a Peace, and being ascertain'd of a Boundary for their security and repose, they shall find themselves destitute
<PB N="53" REF="33"/> on one side, and infested by a thousand inconvenien∣cies on the other.</P>
<P>What the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadors say farther in that Memorial, merits 2 very particular reflecti∣on, that their Sentiments in the present case are conformable to the practise in all other Treaties; it being very notorious, that when there is a Gene∣ral Treaty made, all the Contractors ought to have satisfaction, which cannot be applied to the case in hand. His most Christian Majesty having thought good to enter into a particular Negotiation with the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the States General, without sharing with the other Allies, which would not con∣cur therein. Tis true, that if the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or the States General, should not perform the Condi∣tions of such a General Treaty, but fail therein, his most Christian Majesty might justly demand the effect of the Conditions agreed unto: but these two Powers being altogether disposed to satisfie in all, and by all, which they are engaged to, on their behalf, his Majesty cannot have the least pre∣tence, that they should be frustrated of the accom∣plishment of what should be promised them by particular Treaties, and upon consideration where∣of, they should set their hands. Over and above, that his Majesty, having put into the first Article of his Propositions, the entire satisfaction the <HI>Swede</HI> should have, which is now made the ground of all the present difficulties, explains himself in the same Period by these words, [That without them, he could not conclude upon all the rest.] Whence it ought to be inferred, without all manner of dispute, that he would not desist in case of a General Treaty; but that it was not intended to apply it to
<PB N="54" REF="34"/> the case of particular Conventions, which is now in question.</P>
<P>The Allegations which are made to this Propo∣sal of the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty, and the example of <HI>Verceil,</HI> the restitution whereof the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath promised, are not at all applicable here; for that Places was in his own hands, and he might dispose of it as he thought good: but in our case, they have not onely not demanded any restitution, either from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or the States General, as indeed it could not justly be required of them, be∣cause they were not all possessed of any thing that appertained to the <HI>Swede;</HI> his most Christian Ma∣jesty proposing no other matter to them, but the Neutrality onely: and there might, on the con∣trary, be drawn a solid Argument from the same Treaty of the <HI>Pyrenaeans,</HI> to justifie what is at pre∣sent pretended to, concerning the Evacuation, al∣ledging, that his most Christian Majesty hath con∣sented to the restitution of the Places to <HI>Spain,</HI> not∣withstanding the continuation of the War between that Crown and <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>Tis true, that in the project of Treaties, there is no mention at all made of the Time when the Places should be restored; but it is certain and no∣torious, that the Consequence of a Treaty is the immediate Exchange of Ratifications, after which, full satisfaction ought to be given to all that is promised and agreed unto, without any limitation of time; and to that end there can be nothing ap∣plied more Authentick, than what his Majesty. was pleased to alledge in his last Letter of the <HI>30th.</HI> of <HI>June</HI> pass'd, where he says, That it is the usual cu∣stom in all Treaties, for all things to continue in the
<PB N="55" REF="34"/> state they are in, till the Peace be absolutely con∣summated by Exchange of Ratifications, and the Publication of them; and that consequently it were directly contrary to that usage, for his Majesty to pretend to detain the places, after the Ratifications duly Exchanged, and the Publication made. Their Lordships may dispense with the Discourse of the Conduct of his Majesties Army in the <HI>Spanish Ne∣therlands,</HI> after the return of Monsieur <HI>de Lanoy,</HI> who brought back his Majesty's Answer of the <HI>30th.</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> made to theirs of the <HI>22d.</HI> of the same month; but in the mean time they afflict themselves, not without reason, because that by all these diffi∣culties, so ill grounded, the Conclusion and Signa∣ture of the Treaties hath been retarded, and even refused; when as their Ambassadors did duly pre∣sent themselves to those of his most Christian Ma∣jesty, according to their promise, because that their Lordships could by no means endure, that the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> no more than they themselves to their extreme prejudice, should be disappointed in the principal effect of Peace; namely, of the Eva∣cuation of the said Places, and consequently of the Boundary, which his Majesty had so frequently and solemnly assured them.</P>
<P>Their High and Mighty Lordships sincerely de∣clare, that they desire nothing more cordially, than to see the Peace established between his Majesty, the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and their own State joyntly to∣gether, with all the Confederates that will subscribe it; and that they are willing, and ready also to cause the Treaties to be Concluded and Signed: But we cannot justly desire of them, that the said Evacuati∣on should depend upon the success of Affairs, and a Restitution and Satisfaction, which according to all
<PB N="56" REF="35"/> humane apprehension, will not be regulated, but by the success of the War, the Accidents and Chances whereof are always exposed to incertainty.</P>
<P>Tis further to be taken into consideration, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> has not to this hour given any order for the satisfaction of their High and Mighty Lordships, in regard of the just complaints, and ex∣cessive damages of their Subjects; nay, not so much as to renew and re-establish their ancient Amity with them; but contrarily, daily add new prejudices to their Negotiation, by Acts of Hostility, directly con∣trary to the Treaties provisionally established.</P>
<P>And as his Majesty ought rationally to expect, from the Lords the States General, that they should ever look upon his Royal Word as firm and invio∣lable, they cannot be persuaded, that he would by any means whatsoever alter the Conditions which he hath proposed by so remarkable a Change; and are so much the more assured thereof, in that their Ambassadors at <HI>London,</HI> having represented to his Majesty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> the scruple of this new upstart Difficulty, his Majesty did answer them with assurance, that there should be no stop upon it; and thereby they have been strongly persuaded, that this delay was to be imputed, not to his Ma∣jesties Sentiments, but to the persuasion of those who desire not a Peace: but that however they hope his Majesty, according to the greatness of his Gene∣rosity, will take off that Delay.</P>
<P>As to the Proposition the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadors made in their Memorial, the Lords the States Ge∣neral do consider it two very different ways; either as an Expedient to accommodate the Affairs of the Northern Powers, by amicable means; or else to employ their Forces to oblige their Allies to return
<PB N="57" REF="35"/> the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> their Conquests, obtain'd du∣ring this War. As to the first, they doubt not that the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadors are sufficiently persuaded, with what servor they desired to see the accom∣plishment of a General Peace; and they shall never be better satisfied in any thing, than in seeing it concluded, and that they will always continue to interpose, and use their utmost endeavours to ob∣tain a Benefit so much desired; intreating his Ma∣jesty, that he will please to furnish them with means in order thereunto, their Ambassadors being fully informed of their good intentions, without being obliged to the Evacuation of Places: But if it be his Majesties inclination to engage them, in pursuance of that proposition to violence, and con∣straint, they find themselves obliged to say, That they understand no manner of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ity therein, and that it is diametrically opposite to, what his Ma∣jesty did himself judge reasonable, and that they can by no means subscribe it, not being able at all to prevail with themselves but by force; they must engage their Allies, with whom they have been concern'd in the same Obligations, to restore what they have taken from the <HI>Swedish</HI> King, and so consequently must be necessitated to take up Arms against their Friends and Confederates; a thing altogether unheard of, and which cannot justly be required of them; his Majesty having se∣veral times declar'd, that as for himself and his Allies, and in confideration of their Mighty Lord∣ships and theirs, he onely demanded the Neutrality before-mention'd.</P>
<P>And thus the Lords the States General do as∣sure themselves, that the French Ambassadors, as well as all those that are not prepossess'd, will be
<PB N="56" REF="36"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="57" REF="36"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="58" REF="37"/> convinced, that their Lordships are no way in fault, if the Peace be not immediatly Concluded, and that the obligation to the Retention of the Towns cannot be imputed to them, it being so prejudicial to the Interest of their Affairs, that they can never be able to consent to it.</P>
<P>They farther declare, that they will joyntly use their utmost endeavours, for the accomodation of the Northern Powers, who are now at War, and who in effect, Conform themselves to the Expedient, which the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadors have proposed: but if their Reflection be applied by way of Force and Constraint, it cannot be in their opinion and expedient, but a thing never heard of, that by the Treaty of Peace, instead of disengaging them∣selves from the War, they should be constrained to turn it against their Allies. They do not at all doubt, that his Majesty has a Design to procure the Quiet of <HI>Europe,</HI> and they will voluntarily Contribute on their part, all they can possibly, but they cannot by any means expect from his Ma∣jesties Justice, that he would oblige them to it, after so prejudicial a manner as the Retention of the Places will prove, and upon so vexatious a Condition, as that of waging War against their Allies, their Mighty Lordships, as they are wholly bent upon the Contribution of all friendly Offices, for the accommodation of the said Affairs in the North. So also, they promise themselves farther, that his Majesty will be willing to issue out necessa∣ry Orders for the Conclusion and Signing of the Peace upon the Conditions profer'd, and that he will furnish them with Expedients, to Contri∣bute also on their part, to the Repose of Christen∣dom.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="37"/>
<P>This is that which the Lords the States General of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> have thought good to give in answer to the Memorial of the <HI>French</HI> Am∣bassadors, at the same time Ordering their own Ambassadors, to appear forward in the Conclud∣ing and Signing the Peace, and most carnestly be∣seech the said <HI>French</HI> Ambassadors to Concur with them in that Business.</P>
<P>But if the Completing of so beneficial a Work, and so universally desired, be delayed upon the account of retaining the Places, the said Ambassa∣dors of the Lords the States General, are obliged to protest in the name and behalf of the Lords their Masters, that their High and Mighty Lord∣ships do no ways obstruct the Peace from being brought to a happy Issue.</P>

<P><HI>A Memorial delivered to the Ple∣nipotentiaries of</HI> France, <HI>by the Pleni∣potentiaries of</HI> Sweden; July, <HI>the</HI> 27th. 1678.</P>
<P>THe Declaration of his Most Christian Majesty, that the Places should not be Surrendered to <HI>Spain</HI> and the States General, before the <HI>Swedes</HI> should receive satisfaction, is so Just and Gene∣rous, that his Most Christian Majesty cannot but thereby come off with Honour, and the King our Master with great Satisfaction. We could wish that that Declaration might have reduced our Com∣mon Enemies to Reason; but since it hath met with great opposition, as appears by the Memorial of
<PB N="60" REF="38"/> the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassadors, his Most Christian Ma∣jesty will without doubt Examine, if to arrive at the end proposed thereby; in consideration of the Re∣establishment of <HI>Sweden,</HI> it will be more pro∣per to defer the Restitution of the Places with the prospect of making a general Peace, of else agree to it as the States General desire, to the end there may be procur'd a Compleat particular Peace with <HI>Spain</HI> and States General, as well for <HI>France</HI> as <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>On our part, we are not sufficiently informed what thoughts the King our Master may have upon this Affair; but as our Orders in general are, that we ought to Conform our selves to the pleasure of <HI>France</HI> in the like Case, that we have good proof of the Intentions and Care of his Most Christian Majesty, and that we have not the Li∣berty to Correspond with the King our Master, to understand his Orders, We can assure you, that the King our Master will remain satisfied with what his Most Christian Majesty shall judge sit to Re∣solve, upon the account of the said Restitution of Places, as we do also put our whole confidence in his Majesties Royal prudence, who one way or o∣ther will furnish him with such means as may tend to his own Glory; together with the absolute Re∣establishment of his Ally.</P>
<P>This is all we have Order to say; but if be∣sides this, we must explain our mind more particu∣larly, we are apt to believe, that in this present juncture of Affairs, the Compleating a particular Peace, by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Swede,</HI> with the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and <HI>Hollander,</HI> would prove advantageous to the common Interest, and withall Glorious to his
<PB N="61" REF="38"/> Most Christian Majesty. For it is for the advance∣ment of the common Interest.</P>
<P N="1">1. To disengage themselves from 2 Enemies, that are so much the more Considerable, because they support others by their Aids.</P>
<P N="2">2. To avoid the new Rupture wherewith we are threatned, which being over, we cannot see how the <HI>Swedes</HI> will be able to make opposition, if you consider only their Commerce.</P>
<P N="3">3. To divert the Engagements that are made against <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. To frustrate their Design, who endeavour strictly to League together all the States of the Empire.</P>
<P N="5">5. To be able to reduce to Peace the other Allies, who continue still in War, and so procure a Gene∣ral one, for which there is some probability, since that upon the Rumor of Accommodation between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> we see they were troubled, and begin to yield.</P>
<P N="6">6. To be able to act Victoriously by force of Arms, against the said Confederates, in case that they refuse an Accommodation; the War being to be carried on against them with greater ease, when they are separated from those that have assorded them the greatest Supplies.</P>
<P>Besides it will be very Honorable for his Most Christian Majesty.</P>
<P N="1">1. To be able once more to restore Peace to Christendom.</P>
<P N="2">2. To break all the Intreagues of his Enemies.</P>
<P N="3">3. To Establish his Interests in what we have said before.</P>
<P N="4">4. To shew that he hath other ways for the Re∣establishment
<PB N="62" REF="39"/> of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> besides that now in Question.</P>
<P N="5">5. To take occasion to make them sensible of the effects of his just Resentments towards them, who in these present Intreagues, have stood in opposition both to his good Designs and to his Glory.</P>
<P N="6">6. To disabuse them who by the Inductions of those that are evil inclined, have questioned the sincerity of his Majesties Intentions, in this Ne∣gotiation.</P>
<P N="7">7. To let the World know that the intentions of others have been in effect to oppose the general Peace, since without that Impediment it might have been obtained.</P>
<P>These are the Reasons of our particular Senti∣ments, which we beseech your Excellencies to take into your Consideration; but for the remainder to testify to his Most Christian Majesty, that we have no other Order from the King our Master, but to depend upon his Care for our Security, as hath been before Specified.</P>

<HEAD>The second Memorial of the Am∣bassadors of <HI>France,</HI> given into the Am∣bassadors of the States General, the <HI>29th.</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> 1678.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THe Ambassadors Extraordinary, and Plenipo∣tentiaries of</HI> France, <HI>not thinking fit to give an answer at present to the Memorial of the Am∣bassadors of the States General of the</HI> 26th. <HI>of</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="39"/> <HI>this month, when they ought rather to consider how to remove the impediment that is risen to obstruct the conclusion of the Peace, than to enter into such particulars of actions and reasonings as may ex∣asperate, will say thus much onely, that since the States General declare themselves to be fully satisfied as to the sincerity of the intentions of the King their Master, and his Majesty is no less perswaded of their disposition towards a perfect reconciliation with himself, all that remains to be done, is to find the most ready means to perfect this great Work. To which end, the Ambassadors of</HI> France <HI>do now again assure the Ambassadors of the States General, that his Majesty will rea∣dily joyn with them in such expedients as shall be most proper to remove the difficulties that hinder the Signing of the Peace. The said Am∣bassadors of the States General may easily have observed that no other interest with-holds his Majesty, than that of the King his Ally, whose satisfaction is the only end that he proposeth to himself in this Affair. His Majesty is also willing to admit of any proposals to accommodate it, and questions not but that some expedient may be found, with which both himself and the States General may be satisfied. But to give a publick Instance of his real intentions for Peace, and of his unfeigned affection to the States General; his Majesty desires to hear himself what they can pro∣pose, to remove the impediments that stand in their way, and to joyn with them in. such expe∣dients as may equally answer the security, that both himself wisheth and they desire. To this purpose his Majesty thinks fit to advance as far as St.</HI> Quentin, <HI>whither such Deputies that they shall</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="40"/> <HI>resolve to send to him, may resort; and if they shall accept, as his Majesty believes they will, so beneficial an offer, his Majesty will be in that Town six days, after he shall have understood by his Ambassadors, that the States have agreed to send their Ministers thither: so that he and they may come thither at one and the same time. And as his Majesty doth not question but they will bring with them such sentiments as shall be just and reasonable, they will find his Majesty so fairly dispos'd, that they will have no cause left to question the Sincerity with which his Majesty hath begun and continued his endeavours for Peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But because the Ambassadors of the States Ge∣neral have remonstrated to those of</HI> France, <HI>at a conference held the</HI> 17th. <HI>of this month, that since his Majesties promise not to attaque any Place in the</HI> Low Countreys <HI>is expired, it will be necessary to take some measures to procure a Cessation of all Acts of hostility, whilst this Negotiation is on foot; the said Ambassadors have already re∣ceived instructions from his Majesty, to assure their Excellencies, that his Majesty will willingly agree with the Deputies of the States General, upon using all means that may prevent it's being in∣terrupted by Arms.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The said Ambassadors of</HI> France, <HI>cannot but think that it will be for the advantage of the States General, to discuss this affair with his Ma∣jesty, and to agree upon the Peace with him. But if they had rather treat of it nearer their own Fronteers, his Majesty gives them liberty to send their Deputies to</HI> Gand, <HI>where such persons as shall be there on his Majesties behalf, shall have power to Treat with them upon the difficulties than</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="40"/> <HI>are risen concerning the time for evacuating the Places, and to conclude upon such expedients as may both satisfie his Majesty, and content the States General, and also to agree forthwith upon a Ces∣sation of Hostility; so as no molestation may be given to such dispositions for Peace, as this Negocia∣tion may produce.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>A Memorial given in by the Ambas∣sadors of the States General, to the Am∣bassadors of</HI> France, <HI>the</HI> 4th. <HI>of</HI> August, 1678.</HEAD>
<P>THe Ambassador and Envoy Extraordinary of their Lordships the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> having sent to their Hi. and Mi. the Memorial of the Lords Ambassadors of <HI>France,</HI> of the <HI>29th.</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> have received express order from their Masters to answer their Excellencies, that they were transported to understand thereby the continuance of his most Christian Majesty's real intentions for Peace; and that themselves will not be wanting on their part to do whatever may fur∣ther the concluding it, and that they are ex∣tremely sorry to see it stick solely upon giving the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> satisfaction, and that that should be of such consideration to his Majesty, as to be capable of giving a stop to the finishing a work that is so much desired.</P>
<P>The States General think, that they have done all that could possibly be expected from a State, that is a Lover of Peace; having declared their ac∣ceptance
<PB N="66" REF="41"/> of the Conditions which the King himself had proposed, as far as they concern themselves; and having laboured to the utmost of their power to bring their Allies to a compliance; in which endeavours they have been so successful with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> that he likewise accepts the Condi∣tions that concern himself. And yet after all this, to their great sorrow, they find themselves deprived of the benefit of those Conditions, not upon the account of any thing that might or ought to have been done by them, but because the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> must first be satisfi'd, though neither his Catholick Majesty nor themselves possessed any thing that must make part of his satisfaction; and though the said King continue daily to exercise all manner of Ho∣stilities against their Inhabitants, directly contrary to Treaties solemnly ratifi'd.</P>
<P>Yet their Hi. and Mi. notwithstanding their Inha∣bitants meet with such bad usage from the said King, and though they have evidently had just cause to fall upon him, and make War upon him, as he does upon them, have chosen rather to endea∣vour a Peace in the North, and have offered to do all good offices in order to it; if his most Chri∣stian Majesty will be pleased to furnish them with some Expedients; and they do yet persist in the same mind, and should be ready to propose Ex∣pedients themselves, if they knew of any: But they cannot in any wise expect from his Majesties generous disposition, that after having testifi'd so much good will to them, he should oblige them to act forcibly against their Allies; and that, not to procure his Majesty better satisfaction, but meerly for the benefit of his Ally.</P>
<P>Their Hi. and Mi. will ever profess a great reve∣rence
<PB N="67" REF="41"/> for his Majesty, and will bear him as much de∣ference as he can possibly desire; but they do not see of what use it will be to put his Majesty to trou∣ble, by sending their Deputies to St. <HI>Quintin,</HI> not having any themselves to propose to him; for the Places must be Evacuated when the Treaty is con∣cluded, in discharge of that solemn promise which his Majesty made to them; and as to that, there remains no difficulty. And concerning the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as his Majesties Ally, they offer to do all friendly offices for his Accommodation; and cer∣tainly such endeavours cannot be made with greater likelihood of success any where else, than at <HI>Ni∣meguen,</HI> where all the Ministers of the Confederates are: There we may labour to dispose them, with hopes of success; there we may be informed of what-ever may be necessary to promote the com∣mon good, and may use all manner of endeavours, which cannot be so successful, either at St. <HI>Quintin</HI> or at <HI>Ghent.</HI></P>
<P>The States General conceive the less hopes from such a Deputation, because the Ambassadors of <HI>France</HI> did not instance, as to what Expedients in particular their Deputies should come instructed: and they think his Majesty may propose what he would have, and do what-ever is to be done sooner, and more readily at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> than either at St: <HI>Quintin</HI> or any other Place. They desire with all their hearts, that his Majesty would propose some Expedients to further the Peace; and them∣selves will at the same time make appear, how af∣fectionately they desire to help forward, as much as in them lies, the perfecting this great work: and they earnestly desire, that the time may be well husbanded, for that as yet they find them∣selves
<PB N="68" REF="42"/> in a condition able to conclude a Peace up∣on the terms that have been proposed, though they have been involv'd in a great deal of trouble, and been put upon a necessity of entring into new Engagements, by their manner of acting, whose expectations are not answered by the Peace, and who represented the Evacuation of the Places to their Hi. and Mi. as a thing to be despaired of; though they made those Engagements with such caution and regard to his Majesty, that they can be of no effect, unless the matter should fall out so unfortunately, as that his Most Christian Ma∣jesty should set such a value upon the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Satisfaction, and not to resolve to Eva∣cuate the Places but upon those terms, though the Exchange of the Ratifications ensued upon it.</P>
<P>The States General do instantly desire his Ma∣jesty to conclude the Treaties, and not to suffer the finishing them to stick at the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Satisfaction; and to make them so happy, as to give them some assurance, as soon as may be, by taking up a favourable resolution, which is the thing they so greatly desire.</P>

<HEAD>The third Memorial of the Am∣bassadors of <HI>France,</HI> given in to the Ambassadors of the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> the <HI>6th.</HI> of <HI>Au∣gust,</HI> 1678.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THe Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipoten∣tiaries of</HI> France, <HI>to make appear more and more his Majesties sincere desire to give quiet to all Christendom, by the care that his Majesty con∣tinues to take for the removing such obstacles as hinder the accomplishing so great a work, declare to the Ambassadors of the States General, that as his Majesty design'd to retain those Places, till the King of Sweden were entirely satisfied; onely be∣cause the Ambassadors of that Crown thought it necessary for the King their Master; so he is now willing to desist, if those Ambassadors will consent, that he forbear to stand upon it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is evident, that his Majesty doth not incline to any Party, but out of his desire to finish the affair of the Peace as soon as may be; and out of the confidence that he reposeth in the word of the States General, he hath always desired, that they would send their Deputies, either to himself, or to</HI> Ghent, <HI>both to concert what will be necessary for the warranting to his Majesty the Engagement that</HI> Spain <HI>is to enter into, of not assisting his Enemies, nor those of his Allies, and to agree upon such means as his Majesty should propose to them, for the more easie restoring of</HI> Sweden, <HI>without obliging them to enter into a War in order to it:</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="43"/> <HI>And one of the first effects that would ensue upon these Conferences, would be that of taking mea∣sures to supersede all Acts of Hostility, and of pro∣viding for the subsisting of</HI> Mons, <HI>while the Con∣ferences should last.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The said Ambassadors cannot doubt, but that such an overture will remove those difficulties that have hindred the States General, and that as the signing their Treaty, and that of</HI> Spain, <HI>was de∣layed, onely by his Majesties pretending to retain all the Places; so his desisting from that, will en∣able them to sign the Peace. They conceive like∣wise, that the said States General will be sensible of his Majesties offers to surcease all acts of War, and assure the subsistance of</HI> Mons, <HI>which would perfectly be restored, if the Peace were concluded with their Deputies, so as there is ground of assurance that it will.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>A Memorial given by the Ambassa∣dors of</HI> Sweden, <HI>to the Ambassadors of</HI> France, <HI>this</HI> 9th. <HI>of</HI> August, 1678.</HEAD>
<P>THe Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipoten∣tiary of <HI>Sweden,</HI> being informed that the Ambassadors of the States General, at a confe∣rence with the Ambassadors of his Most Christian Majesty, held the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> would have imputed to <HI>Sweden</HI> the delay that was hapned to the conclusion of the Peace, that is making up be∣twixt the King their Master, and the States Ge∣neral, conceive it is their duty to acquaint the
<PB N="71" REF="43"/> Ambassadors and Plenipotentiaries of his Most Christian Majesty, how they have acted through∣out this affair, by which it will appear not to be long of them, that the Treaty is not at present ready to be perfected and Signed.</P>
<P>In the first place, as the regulation of Com∣merce makes the principal point of the Treaty on the part of the States General, the said Am∣bassadors of <HI>Sweden</HI> have offered all the facili∣ties that could be desired of them in order to it. It was upon the <HI>20th.</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> that the Count of <HI>Oxenstierne</HI> presented an Article for referring this affair to Commissioners, which not being agreed to, and the Ambassadors of the States General, declaring that their Principals and Ma∣sters desired to see the regulation finished before the Peace were concluded, the said Count of <HI>Ox∣enstierne</HI> consented to enter into the particulars of the States Project of Commerce, and there∣upon, on the <HI>27th.</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> acquainted Monsieur <HI>de Beverning,</HI> Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the States General, that he had drawn a Counter-Project upon some Articles not yet agreed; which Counter-Project having been read to the Sieur <HI>de Beverning,</HI> was immediately by his advice delivered to Sieur <HI>Silvercroon,</HI> Com∣missary of <HI>Sweden,</HI> with orders to go quickly to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and help to inform the States General more fully by Word of mouth, of the reasons upon which the Counter-Project was grounded, the said Sieur <HI>de Beverning</HI> affirming likewise that he had writ to his Principals and Masters, to appoint Commissioners to confer all matters with him as soon as might be. Which though the said Sieur <HI>Silvercroon</HI> immediately did, and the States
<PB N="72" REF="44"/> General received the Counter-Project, yet now in seven weeks time they have not return'd their answer to it, and remitted the affair hither to be adjusted and finished, by the Ambassadors and Pleni∣potentiaries of both parties: in order whereunto the Ambassadors of <HI>Sweden</HI> have not failed all this time to make frequent instances, both here at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> where they have been assisted by the Ambassadors of <HI>France,</HI> and at the <HI>Hague</HI> by the Sieur <HI>Silvercroon.</HI> Besides this point of Commerce, as there have been some complaints made that cer∣tain Vessels laden with Corn, and belonging to the Subjects of this State, have been taken and carried to <HI>Straelsond,</HI> and that Count <HI>Conningsmark</HI> had taken out their lading to serve for food for his Army, the Ambassadors of <HI>Sweden</HI> having been informed of the said complaints by the Ambassa∣dors of the States General, gave in a Declaration the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> that the said action of the Mare∣shal of <HI>Connigsmark</HI> could not be reputed any other than a meer act of necessity, which he then was reduced to, through want of Victuals and Cor∣respondence; that the parties concern'd should be satisfied to the full, and that he would pass any such Act to that end as should be thought fit, knowing that such was the King his Masters inten∣tion. The same has likewise bin assured by the Com∣missary <HI>Silvercroon</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and an extract has since been delivered of a Letter from the Mare∣shal <HI>de Coningsmark,</HI> containing the like assurances, together with a relation how he had acted, and that he had paid the Masters of the Ships their Freight. Which things being so, the Ambassa∣dors of <HI>Sweden</HI> believed that the States General would have received all the satisfaction they
<PB N="73" REF="44"/> could possibly desire, and that nothing was want∣ing to conclude a Peace betwixt the King their Master, and them, but to prepare such Articles as are usual almost in all Treaties of Peace, which would be no hard work for the Ambassadors of both parties to do. But in stead of that, they are surprised to understand, that there have been very bitter complaints against <HI>Sweden,</HI> in the answers that the Ambassadors of the States General gave on the <HI>26th.</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> and the <HI>7th.</HI> of <HI>August,</HI> to the Memorials of the Ambassadors of <HI>France,</HI> and though the Ambassadors of <HI>Sweden</HI> have here∣tofore explained and declared themselves, as is before mentioned, yet they would not omit giving some proper answer to them, but that having agreed with the Ambassadors of <HI>France,</HI> that for the avoiding all sharpness, neither of them will meddle in things of that nature, they are willing to pass them all over with silence, and to endeavour something of reality; to which end they repeat their instances here at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> as Monsieur <HI>Boreel</HI> cannot but know, as well as at the <HI>Hague</HI> by the Sieur <HI>Silvercroon,</HI> that the States General would advance the Negotiation with <HI>Sweden,</HI> that the Peace may be concluded at the same time that it shall be with <HI>France,</HI> since one cannot be with∣out the other.</P>
<P>And the Ambassadors of <HI>Sweden</HI> apprehended, that the reiterating their instances had produced a good effect, since the Sieur <HI>Silvercroon</HI> sent word from the <HI>Hague,</HI> by the last Courrier, That he had been conferr'd with, and that the Answer to the Counter-project was ready to be sent to <HI>Nime∣guen.</HI></P>
<P>But whilst they were in this expectation, the
<PB N="74" REF="45"/> Ambassadors of <HI>France</HI> inform them, That but yesterday the Ambassadors of the States General renew'd their complaints against <HI>Sweden,</HI> for rai∣sing difficulties, and that Count <HI>Coningsmark</HI> exer∣cised acts of Hostility, Confiscating Ships and Car∣go's belonging to the Subjects of this State; inso∣much that the States had more reason to continue the War, than to think of a Peace with <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>By which the said Ambassadors perceiving with sorrow, that but little reflection is made upon what they have heretofore advanced, and being also very certain, that Monsieur <HI>Coningsmark</HI> hath not confiscated any thing belonging to the Subjects of this State, nor done any acts of Hostility against them, since they agree to make amends for all; and seeing how lightly the good Offices are thought on, which the Ambassadors of <HI>Sweden</HI> have done since they came to <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> to further a Peace for the benefit of this State; and even the endea∣vours which they have but lately used with his most Christian Majesty, to facilitate the Evacuation of the Places; do entreat the Ambassadors of his Most Christian Majesty, to answer and represent to the Ambassadors of the States General, that they do ill to complain of <HI>Sweden,</HI> after it has offered so many facilities, and made so many advances; and consequently to induce them, instead of exasperating matters, rather to express such readiness and faci∣lity on behalf of the States General, as may rea∣sonably be expected from them, that so both Par∣ties may receive that satisfaction which they wish for, in the conclusion of a good Peace. The said Ambassadors of <HI>Sweden</HI> hope, that the States Gene∣ral have no intentions of protracting the Negotia∣tion of the Peace with <HI>Sweden,</HI> to the end that them∣selves
<PB N="75" REF="45"/> may be able to make a Separate Peace with his most Christian Majesty, excluding <HI>Sweden;</HI> but they think notwithstanding, that to prevent all ob∣stacles, it were well, if all hopes of such a Separa∣tion were taken away. And therefore they do again desire the Ambassadors of his most Christian Ma∣jesty to renew this Declaration to the Ambassadors of the States General, since it was upon this prospect, that the Ambassadors of <HI>Sweden</HI> advised the Restitu∣tion of the Places.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Treaty made, and passed between the commissioners deputed on behalf of the King, and those deputed likewise on behalf of the Catholick King, and of the States General of the</HI> United Provinces <HI>of the</HI> Low Countreys, <HI>about the demenour of the Troops, and Gar∣risons of both sides, in the said</HI> Low Countreys, <HI>till the Ratifi∣cations of the Treaty of Peace are Exchanged.

<P>IT being necessary to regulate after what manner the Forces shall carry themselves in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> till the Ratification of the Peace,
<PB N="76" REF="46"/> for the avoiding all Acts of Hostility that may disturb it, and for the ease of the People on both sides, it is agreed by those underwritten, in pur∣suance of their respective Authorities, as followeth;</P>
<P>That the day after the Ratification of this pre∣sent Treaty, all Acts of Hostility shall cease be∣twixt the Armies, and that in consequence thereof from the morrow of the said Ratification, the two Armies shall retire from the Neighbourhood of <HI>Mons.</HI></P>
<P>That the Army of the Most Christian King shall march toward <HI>Gevries</HI> or <HI>Merbepoterie;</HI> and that Commanded by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> beyond <HI>Havre</HI> towards <HI>Nivelle.</HI></P>
<P>That notwithstanding such Troops as formed the Blockade of <HI>Mon's,</HI> under the Command of Monsieur <HI>du Montal</HI> and Monsieur <HI>de Quincy,</HI> shall not retire on that same day, but two days after the Ratification of the present Treaty, which will be the day after the two Armies shall have marched; and till such time as the said Blockade is raised, the Army Commanded by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> may continue encamp'd as aforesaid.</P>
<P>That the Town of <HI>Mons</HI> shall remain after that in full and perfect Liberty, that all sorts of Persons, Provisions, and Merchandises may go in and out, as they do in other Towns under the obedience of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>That as for the Garrisons, six days after the Ratification of this present Treaty, or sooner, if possible, that is to say as soon as the Convoys can arrive at each Place, no parties nor detatchments shall make incursions into the Grounds and Coun∣treys of one another, but the Troops and Armies of each Crown shall abide within the extent of
<PB N="77" REF="46"/> such Lands and Countreys as are under the obe∣dience of each Crown.</P>
<P>That all such Prisoners as shall be taken on either side after the day of the Ratifying of this present Treaty, shall be restor'd without ransom; even Horses also, Cattel, Equipages, and Merchan∣dises, and generally all other things whatsoever.</P>
<P>That as at the time when the Treaty of Peace shall be executed, or betwixt this and then, it may be necessary for the Troops of one Crown or it's Allies to pass into such Lands and Countreys as now belong to the other: either side shall be at Liberty so to do, only for maintaining communi∣cation betwixt the several Places in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> and to go thence, without taking any thing in such Lands and Countreys but For∣rage only, or Sojourning there any longer than is usual in ordinary marches.</P>
<P>That from the day of the Ratification of this present Treaty, as well the Subjects of each Crown as those of the States General, shall be at Liberty to go and come without Pass-Ports within such Lands and Countreys as do at present belong to the Crown or State, of which they are Subjects; and that there shall be no other need of Pass-Ports than for going from Lands now belonging to one Crown or State, to such as do at present belong to the other.</P>
<P>That from six days after the Ratification of the present Treaty, the Troops and Armies of each Crown shall live upon the Lands and Countreys of which each is now in possession, without for∣raging in one another's Countrey: it being un∣derstood that the word <HI>possession</HI> is not meant to comprehend or pass as in right of possession, such
<PB N="78" REF="47"/> passages and posts as the Armies and Parties have made or do now make in the places where they are or have been.</P>
<P>That from the day of the Ratification of this Treaty, all extraordinary demands of Contri∣butions, Cows, Prisoners, and Carriages shall cease on both sides in one anothers Countrey, so as neither party shall be at Liberty to make such demands upon emergent necessities, but within such Countreys as each is in possession of.</P>
<P>That the Arrears of Contributions for the year that will expire the <HI>16th.</HI> of <HI>October</HI> next, from those Countreys that are actually brought under such Contributions, shall con∣tinue to be exacted on both sides, but in such manner only as shall be agreed by the Lords Plenipotentiaries at <HI>Nimeguen.</HI></P>
<P>That if, contrary to all appearance, any difficulty shall happen as to the performance of this present agreement, in all or in part, the same shall be adjusted in a friendly man∣ner, by the Generals, or such as shall be thereto authorised, without altering this a∣greement upon any such occasion, or suffering any recourse to force.</P>
<P>All this the Deputies underwritten have re∣spectively agreed, and have promised to pro∣duce to morrow the Ratifications of the same by Monsieur, the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> Peer and Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> Captain of the Gar∣de-du-corps to the Most Christian King, Com∣mander in chief of his Majesties Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and by the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI> Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber to his Ca∣tholick

<P><HI>LEWIS</HI> by the grace of God, King of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navar,</HI> To all such as shall see these pre∣sents, greeting.

<PB N="104" REF="60"/> of the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> instructed likewise with plenary powers, a Treaty of Commerce, Naviga∣tion and Marine, in Tenour as followeth; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Treaty of Peace which has this day been con∣cluded betwixt the most Christian King and the Lords the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> putting an end to all the Subjects of discontent, which for some time had altered the affection which his Majesty, following the example of the Kings his Predecessors, hath always had for their good and prosperity; and the said Lords the States Ge∣neral entring again into the same desire, which they have heretofore testified for the greatness of <HI>France,</HI> and into sentiments of a sincere acknowledgment for the obligations and considerable advantages which they have heretofore received from it, there is reason to believe that this good understand∣ing betwixt his Majesty and the States Gene∣ral can never be disturbed. But as his Majesty will not omit any thing that may strengthen it, and the said States General being less desirous to perpe∣tuate it, have thought that there was no better and more certain means than to establish a free and per∣fect correspondence between the Subjects on both Sides; and to this end to regulate their particu∣lar interests in matters of Commerce, Navigation and Marine, by the most proper Laws and Conven∣tions for preventing all inconveniencies that might weaken the said good correspondence; his Majesty aforesaid, to satisfie the desire of the said States, hath ordained the Sieur Comte <HI>d' Estrades,</HI> Mar∣shal of <HI>France,</HI> and Knight of his Orders, the Sieur <HI>Colbert,</HI> Marquiss of <HI>Croissy,</HI> Counsellor in ordinary in his Councel of State, and the Sieur <HI>de Mesmes,</HI> Comte <HI>d' Avaux,</HI> Counsellor also in his

<P>His Majesties Subjects and those of their Lord∣ships the States General of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> of the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> shall mutually enjoy the same freedom in matters of Commerce and Navi∣gation, that they ever enjoyed before this War, throughout all Kingdoms, States and Provinces of either party.</P>

Which shall reciprocally be observed by the Sub∣jects of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> with relation to his Majesties Subjects; and to this end whensoever and as often as it shall be required on either side, there shall be published and renewed within such Lands as are under his said Majesties obdience and within the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> most express and most pre∣cise Prohibitions to make use in any sort whatso∣ever of such Commissions, or Letters of reprisal, on the pain above mentioned, which shall severely be put in execution against the offenders, besides a full restitution which they shall be bound to make to such as they shall any wise have endammaged.</P>

So that the Merchandises and goods of Subjects and Inha∣bitants, shipped in such Vessels, belonging to enemies, during the said Terms, and within the extents afore∣said, may not in any wise be confiscated, by reason of their being on board such enemies Vessel, but shall be restor'd to the proprietors without delay, unless they shall have been put on board after the
<PB N="116" REF="66"/> expiration of the said Terms. And yet it shall in no wise be permitted to transport to enemies Ports such Contrabann'd goods, as shall be found on board such enemies Vessels; though they be restor'd for the reason aforesaid. And as it has been ruled in what has gone before, that a free Ship shall affran∣chise the Wares that are on board it, it is moreover accorded and agreed, that this freedom shall extend to such Persons likewise, as shall be in free Ships; in so much that though they be enemies to both parties, or to one of them, yet being found in a free Ship, they may not be taken thence, unless they be Soldi∣ers, and actually in the Enemies service.</P>

<P>THE Lords, the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> having Affairs of great importance to impart to your Excellence, have Commissionated us under-written their Deputies Extraordinary, and to this end their Hi. and Mi. have provided us of this Letter of Credit, to present to your Excel∣lence.</P>
<P>The Assistances which his Catholique Majesty gave to the State of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> in the beginning of this War, were so useful and advanta∣gious to this Commonwealth, that their Hi. and Mi. shall ever be mindful of it: And to testifie, as soon as was possible, their resentment thereof to his Ca∣tholick Majesty, they failed not to come with all their Forces to his Majestie's succour, when his Pro∣vinces were attack'd by the Arms of the King of <HI>France;</HI> and they assure themselves that your Ex∣cellence is perswaded of it, since your Excellence sees how much their Hi. and Mi. do to this day con∣tribute to the preservation of his Majestie's Country. And notwithstanding this War has been continued many years, and at an infinite expence, yet the ef∣fects have been so unfortunate, that the King of <HI>France,</HI> being puff'd up with his Victories and Con∣quests, will not come out of it, but upon the Con∣ditions that have been delivered at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> to the Mediators, which your Excellence knows what they are.</P>
<PB N="139" REF="77"/>
<P>Which Conditions, considered in themselves, are indeed too hard, and of such a nature as they ought to be rejected, which also their Hi. and Mi. would do in regard of their Allies, and chiefly in regard of his Catholick Majesty, as concerning the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> in the preservation whereof they find themselves so deeply interessed.</P>
<P>But when their Hi. and Mi. reflect upon the Power of the King of <HI>France,</HI> which hitherto and during this War has been such, that he has not only made Head against the Armies of his Catholick Majesty, and those of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> and their Allies, but has made great Conquests in divers Parts, they conceive a just apprehension, that these Conditions, how hard soever, ought yet to be prefer'd, consi∣dering the present state of Affairs, to a continuance of the War, which in all probability would prove very fatal.</P>
<P>Which makes our Masters the States General of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> incline to look upon these Con∣ditions, as receivable, if they should have the hap∣piness to find their Allies, and especially his Catho∣lick Majesty in the same Sentiments.</P>
<P>And should very much wish, That your Excel∣lence, on the behalf of his Catholick Majesty, would concur with them, to make them as agreea∣ble, as may be, to the other Allies.</P>
<P>And in the mean time give Order to labour for a prolongation of the Term, which the King of <HI>France</HI> has given by his Proposition at <HI>Nimeguen.</HI></P>
<P>We expect your Excellencie's Answer as soon as may be, upon the premisses, as being the only Sub∣ject of this Commission.</P>

<P>HIS Excellence having considered this Memo∣rial, and that the loss of <HI>Flanders,</HI> by the hardness of the Conditions of <HI>France,</HI> will be greater and more dishonourable, than by the ill success of Arms, must hope that the States General will not further it, since his Majesty, wholly for its preser∣vation, has exposed himself to the manifest hazards of War, which he has suffered so much by. Also the punctual and religious observance of such strict Treaties, with his said Majesty, to which the pub∣lick Faith obligeth them, will not permit him to make a doubt of it, especially since his Majesty hath and always will havè a firm desire and intention, to contribute as much as possibly he can to their pre∣servation; and that in regard of the Expedient pro∣pos'd, of making new Alliances, for the making sure the said impracticable Conditions of <HI>France,</HI> it is to be considered, that the time in which pre∣cisely they must be concluded, can be no other than that of the Campagne, from which, by means of our so late Alliance with his Majesty of <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI> we ought to expect, by a more prosperous suc∣cess, some redress of Affairs; and it would be a breach of Faith, to abandon his Forces in this Con∣juncture, by admitting Conditions so forlorn, and at the same time failing in our Fidelity to his Im∣perial
<PB N="141" REF="78"/> Majesty, and the other High Allies, especially since the Emperour is resolv'd to run to the defence of <HI>Flanders,</HI> rather than to the reparation of his own losses, and the other High Allies are upon a Treaty, of joyning and imploying all their Forces against <HI>France:</HI> His Excellence being able likewise to assure them, That the King, his Master, since the reduction of <HI>Sicily,</HI> is resolv'd to imploy all his Power, as his Excellence likewise all his Cares, for the defence and re-establishing of this Country; to which, his Excellence hopes, the States General will concur on their part, in an Occurrence, which as it is urgent, so it concerns the greatest good of the common Cause, as being the only mean to ob∣tain a just and lasting Peace.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Memorial of the</HI> Deputies Extra∣ordinary, <HI>of the States General,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to the Duke</HI> de Villa Hermosa, <HI>&amp;c. of the</HI> 14th <HI>of</HI> May.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lords, the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> having seen and perused your Ex∣cellencie's Answer to the Memorial, that we, their under-written Deputies Extraordinary, presented the 8th of this Moneth, could have wished, That your Excellence had not only considered the Condi∣tions offered by the King of <HI>France,</HI> as they are in themselves, but had also made reflexion upon the
<PB N="142" REF="79"/> present state of Affairs, and considered, that the King of <HI>France,</HI> being become Master of all the Frontier Towns of his Catholick Majestie's <HI>Nether∣lands,</HI> was entred into the heart of them, and had made himself Master even of the Town of <HI>Gand,</HI> be∣ing very strong in the Field, and at the Head of a very formidable Army, ready for any enterprize, and in the greatest appearance in the world of suc∣ceeding and conquering where he will: Whereas the Troops of the Allies, not being yet come toge∣ther, much less in a condition to make Head against him, and oppose his designs. Hence it is, that their Hi. and Mi. apprehend with great reason, that what remains to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> will infallibly be lost, if it be not saved, by accept∣ing the Conditions of Peace that are offered; and it would be a thing very sensible to their Hi. and Mi. if what his Catholick Majesty has yet left in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> should be so lost, after such infi∣nite expences, and so much blood spilt, for their preservation. Your Excellence knows but too well, by what has lately happened, what Account one has to make of the Troops of the Confederates, upon occasion. The Assistance which is expected from his Majesty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is very considerable, and will be of great support to our Party; but it deserves your Excellencie's consideration, that those Troops are but newly raised, and that it will require some time to enure them to the War, that as yet there are but few of them in these Parts, and we are uncertain when the rest will come; whereas on the other side, every moment is precious, and great misfortunes may happen in a short space. And moreover, the States, as they have made it to be declared to your Excellence, are not in a condition
<PB N="143" REF="79"/> to carry on the War, in such manner, and with so much vigor, as they have done hitherto, seeing their Treasures are exhausted, and their People not able to contribute so much any longer.</P>
<P>As the Lords, the States General, will always acknowledge to have received, in the beginning of this War, very important and useful Succours from his Catholick Majesty, so they hope, your Excel∣lence will do them the justice to confess, that they have not been wanting in the sequel of it, to testifie their acknowledgment, by using their endeavours, and being at extraordinary charges to assist this Country; and at least that it is not to be imputed to them, that the King of <HI>France</HI> has made so great a progress, and that he will not make Peace, but upon such disadvantagious Conditions, as whereby the Country will indeed be much weakned, and hardly able to maintain necessary Troops for its de∣fence; but on the other hand, the Places will not be so dis-joyn'd, nor the Country so divided, as it was before the War, which will make it easier to be kept and preserved. These Defects may likewise be supplyed by Alliances, and a little time may do much toward a redress of Affairs, and making the King's Subjects, and particularly those of the <HI>Uni∣ted Provinces,</HI> capable of assisting one another; who at present are in so lamentable a condition, and so utterly unable, that they cannot be obliged to a continuance of the extraordinary charges, without great hazard, and without exposing them to the ut∣most extremity, and finding our selves reduced to a necessity, either of accommodating with the Enemy, whether we will or no, or of lying down under the burden. To which they do not think your Excel∣lence will be of opinion, That they stand obliged by
<PB N="144" REF="80"/> those Treaties, that had no other end, than the good of the Allies, and the safety of their People. The said Lords, the States General, have also thought fit, to have it represented to your Excellence, That being informed, That the Ambassadors and Plenipo∣tentiaries of the King of <HI>France,</HI> would be authori∣zed to conclude upon a Truce, to the very last Day of <HI>December</HI> next; they have Ordered their Pleni∣potentiaries at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> to discourse it with them, and see whether they would make one for six Weeks, or three Months at most: Hoping, that if it can be obtain'd, your Excellence will not be dis∣pleased with it, but agree to it, for such Reasons as have been alledged to your Excellence, by word of mouth, and as your Excellence may consider with your self.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Declaration of the Emperour</HI>'s <HI>Ambassadors, at a Conference Extraor∣dinary of the Allies at</HI> Nimeguen, <HI>the</HI> 20th <HI>of</HI> June, 1678.</HEAD>
<P>WE have heard the Proposition that your Ex∣cellencies made to us two days since, contain∣ing
<PB N="146" REF="81"/> in substance, That the Lords, the States Gene∣ral, could not carry on the War any longer, and found themselves obliged to make Peace, for such Reasons as were then more particularly deduced. Your Excellencies would then have known our Sen∣timents thereupon, and you desire the same thing again at this present. Not to fail therein, we hope above all things, that your Excellencies and all the World will do his Imperial Majesty the justice to believe, that he has always behav'd himself like a good and faithful Ally towards all, both in Peace and War. We will not enlarge upon that. His Army has always been seen in the Field, in great numbers, in good order; it is evident, that he has imploy'd it for the good of the common Cause, and that he has made it act in such places as were thought most surable; 'twere needless to particula∣rize the Campagnes, where all was acted for the publick good. Moreover, his Imperial Majesty has assisted his Allies with all the Forces he could, if not with all he would: The Rebellion that has been raised against him in <HI>Hungary,</HI> is also publickly known, and how both his own Subjects, and the <HI>Turk</HI> and the <HI>Tartar</HI> have been stirred up against him; and yet so evident and so near a danger, has not been able to divert or decrease his Forces for the common Interests. Besides, that it is known, he hath sent his Army into the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> to support the acting there, whereby the Enemy had an opportunity to take <HI>Friburg</HI> from him, which makes so much difficulty now. As his Majesty has been intent upon the Affairs of the War, so he has been no less upon those of Peace: And, as your Excellencies can bear us witness, we his Ambassa∣dors have neglected nothing that might promote it;
<PB N="147" REF="81"/> and because we believed, that the most effectual mean to obtain a reasonable Peace, was to act vi∣gorously, we have done all we could, as hath been already said.</P>
<P>For the present, it cannot be doubted, but the Emperour will understand with sorrow, That your Excellencies think Affairs reduced to such extremi∣ties, that there is a necessity of making a Peace, to prevent greater: Your Excellencies have told us your Sentiments thereupon, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> theirs. As for our own, we find, in the first place, That this manner of acting from <HI>France,</HI> to pre∣scribe Conditions of Peace, and admit no Treaties upon them, is against the style and the custom al∣ways practis'd among Soveraign Powers; and we are far from being able to discover by that, any such desire of Peace, as the <HI>French</HI> make so great osten∣tation of. For the Peace it self, his Imperial Ma∣jesty desires it as much as any, and desires it may be general, that the publick repose may be obtain'd, which is his only aim, and the common safety also, which is the chief thing that ought to be procur'd by the said Peace. Your Excellencies confess your selves, that the Conditions contain'd in the Decla∣ration of <HI>France,</HI> are too hard and violent; you have told us likewise, that your meaning is not, that we ought to pass all the Contents of them. You have desired to know our Sentiments upon this Subject, tendring the Offices of the States General, for reducing them to terms of Equity; and we, for our parts, told you then the Reasons, why we can∣not explain our selves fully thereupon.</P>
<P>Howsoever, we declar'd our selves here in the As∣sembly, to the Heer Ambassador <HI>Haren,</HI> that we could not admit of the Alternative, that concerns
<PB N="148" REF="82"/> the Emperour and the Empire, barely as it is ex∣pressed. We have often deduced the Reasons, as well why we cannot restore <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> as why we cannot leave <HI>Friburg</HI> in the hands of the <HI>French.</HI> We hope all the World will think them well ground∣ed, and with all this we have not fail'd to acquaint the Emperour by a Courier Express, whose return we expect. In the mean time, being willing to leave nothing undone on our side, that may fur∣ther the Peace, we again pray your Excellencies, to interpose those good Offices which you offered us, to dispose the Ambassadors of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To admit of more equitable Conditions of Peace.</P>
<P N="2">2. To treat with us upon them, since we are rea∣dy on our side, and desirous to do it with all kind of moderation.</P>
<P N="3">3. To take the same care for the Interests of our Allies, as for our selves, particularly for his Highness the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who has been used worst of all, and that the Estates of the Empire may also have due satisfaction.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Declaration of the Ambassadors of</HI> Spain, <HI>at an Extraordinary Conference of the Allies, the</HI> 20th <HI>of</HI> June, 1678.</HEAD>
<P>ALL that we can say upon the present Subject, is but to confirm and approve, as we do abso∣lutely, what Mons. the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa,</HI> hath
<PB N="149" REF="82"/> said and expressed in his Writing, dated at <HI>Brussels,</HI> the 3d of <HI>June,</HI> 1678. declaring only, that we will not separate our selves from the Interests of our Allies, either in Peace or War, in whatsoever may depend upon the King our Master.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Declaration of the Ambassadors of</HI> Denmark, <HI>at an Extraordinary Confe∣rence of the Allies at</HI> Nimeguen, <HI>the</HI> 20th <HI>of</HI> June, 1678.</HEAD>
<P>WHosoever shall compare the time that is elaps'd, since the return of his Excellence the Heer Ambassador <HI>van Beverningh,</HI> from the Journey which he took to his Most Christian Majesty, and since he communicated his Report only to the Mini∣sters of the High Allies at the <HI>Hague,</HI> with that within which they require of us a final Declaration, on behalf of his Majesty the King our Master, upon so nice a matter, as concerns no less than an abso∣lute decision betwixt accepting a Peace, and conti∣nuing the War, may easily observe, that it has not been sufficient for us to receive necessary Orders from our Master thereupon, and apprehend, that it is not in the power of Ministers, to determine of their own heads so important a resolution.</P>
<P>Fearing lest this might happen, we required a convenient delay, by a Memorial delivered above eight days ago, into the hands of their Excellen∣cies, the Lords, Ambassadors Extraordinary of the Lords the States General; but to this present no Answer thereunto has ensued, and instead thereof,
<PB N="150" REF="83"/> the necessity of Affairs, the lamentable condition of the <HI>Spanish Low-Countries,</HI> the <HI>United Provinces</HI> not being able to raise supplies, for defraying the excessive expences of the War, what-ever hope we might have form'd to our selves of assistance from <HI>England,</HI> being utterly vanish'd, and the formida∣ble Power of the Enemy, are now laid for a founda∣tion, to the measures that are to be taken to pre∣vent that by Peace, which 'tis believ'd cannot be hindred by continuing the War. The King our Master could not understand these extremities, but with the utmost compassion and perplexity of mind; and if he be thought capable of bringing any reme∣dy on his side, we can give assurance on his behalf, that he will apply himself to it with the same gene∣rosity, care and concern, out of which he has hi∣therto made appear by the effects, that his only content and repose consists in the welfare of his Allies.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it is a very difficult thing to give any counsel and advice, in a matter that seems to be already determined, and which sticks at no∣thing but the formality of its execution.</P>
<P>On Saturday last, their Excellencies, the Ambas∣sadors of the Lords the States General, declar'd to us, That their Masters saw no other mean to save themselves from the ruine, which was like to drag them, through that of the <HI>Spanish Low-Countries,</HI> into the utter subversion of their Common-wealth, than that of a sudden Peace. They told us, That the Lords Ambassadors of <HI>France</HI> expressed them∣selves dispos'd, to conclude one separately with them, and all those that should desire to come into it, they invited us to joyn with them in it, and at the same time assur'd us, that since of necessity they
<PB N="151" REF="83"/> must avoid the confusion, that the Answer they should have to make to the Most Christian King, concerning the accepting a cessation of Arms, would bring them into, they found themselves obliged to make a Peace alone, to their own best advantage, before the end of this present Month, though we should not be able in that time to concur with them in it; this cessation of Arms not being necessary to them, for their own particular interests.</P>
<P>What room is left then for any counsel or advice in the Case? We see no other measures to take, for what concerns the King our Master, than to put their Excellencies, the Ambassadors of the Lords the States General, in mind of their own Assertion, to wit, That this Peace, even though they should see themselves obliged to make it with <HI>France,</HI> should keep the Lords, the States General, their Masters, no less under the power of their engagements, at the bottom of the mutual Treaties betwixt them and their Allies, and to pray them, as we do most in∣stantly, to proceed in it with such caution and wis∣dom, as that it may not at the same time involve any prejudicial consequence to that of the North.</P>
<P>The 18th Article of the Treaty betwixt his Ma∣jesty, and the Lords the States General, upon the occasion of the present War, shews plainly, how far his Majesty and they stand mutually engaged to one another. We are bound in duty to insist upon it, till we have received Orders from our Master to dispence with it, which of our own heads we cannot do; and we conjure the Lords the States General, by what-ever is most sacred in the publick Faith, and in such solemn stipulations, not to do or take in hand any thing that may derogate from its force.</P>
<PB N="152" REF="84"/>
<P>We wish for the Peace, as much as it can be wish'd for, and envy it not our Allies; if they will shew us a way to obtain a sure and honourable Peace, we embrace it from this day forward; and if <HI>France</HI> will make a Peace with his Majesty, we believe he is altogether ready to accept it, so it be founded up∣on Reason, and the good union, which will always keep him inseparable from the fortune of his Al∣lies.</P>
<P>Finally, We pray God to inspire always the Lords the States General with Counsels worthy their moderation, and the consideration which they ought to have, for those whom themselves have drawn in∣to the perils of the present War, and to bless their Designs and Advances, for the security of the gene∣ral Quiet of all Christendom.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Declaration of the Ambassador of the</HI> Elector <HI>of</HI> Brandenburg, <HI>on Munday the</HI> 20th <HI>of</HI> June, 1678.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ambassador of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> says, That it was evident, that his Electoral Serenity his Master, before the Most Christian King took up Arms against their Hi. and Mi. the States General, failed not to do all he could to divert him, and that likewise since the fire of this War has been kindled, he has desired nothing more earnestly, than to see it quench'd as soon as might be, and the publick repose every where establish'd; and that it was upon the sole consideration of promoting the Peace, that his Electoral Serenity entred into such strict Bonds with
<PB N="153" REF="84"/> his Allies, and especially with their Hi. and Mi. that he hath expos'd and sacrific'd his Person and Estates for that, and hath enjoyn'd his Plenipoten∣tiaries at this Congress, and renews his Orders time after time, to labour for a Peace with their utmost endeavours, according to the Alliances betwixt the Confederates, which prescribe a method to be ob∣served for obtaining a general Peace, that was agreed on joyntly by them all. That their Excellencies, the Ambassadors of their Hi. and Mi. alledged two days since, that their Lordships, the States, both in respect of the condition of their own Provinces, and that of others, find themselves at present redu∣ced to a necessity of making a Peace with <HI>France,</HI> whether they will or no. That at the same time, to observe their Alliances, they express a desire to have their Allies joyn with them in it; but that withal they think themselves necessitated, for the saving their Common-wealth from the shipwrack that threatens it, to make a Peace alone, or with∣out the Confederates, in case they cannot accept the Conditions that <HI>France</HI> hath prescribed; that there∣upon they required the resolution of their Allies with all speed, that they might take their Measures thereby, at the Consultation that is to be held this Week at the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>The Plenipotentiary Ambassador of his Electoral Serenity says to it, That he knows not what resolu∣tion his Master will take, for that he could not re∣ceive Instructions from him in so short a time, upon the Declaration which the Most Christian King de∣livered on the first of this Month of <HI>June,</HI> to the Heer Ambassador <HI>Van Beverning.</HI> That in the mean time he partly explain'd himself, as to his own private Sentiment, in the Memorial of the 10th of
<PB N="154" REF="85"/> <HI>June,</HI> which he presented to the Ambassadors of their Hi. and Mi. and that he doubted not, but they made all due and fitting Reflexions thereupon. That for the rest, he was fully perswaded, though some un∣conquerable necessity might dispence with the States General, or should oblige them to depart from any point of their Alliance with his Electoral Serenity, that yet they will always proceed in it with such caution and sincerity, as the foundation may subsist notwithstanding, and his Electoral Serenity be at no prejudice, nor the band of their friendship and good understanding to be weakned.</P>
<P>The said Ambassador added two Points, requiring the said Lords the States to consider them, when they should take this matter into consideration. The one, That <HI>France,</HI> in the Project of Peace, which its Ambassadors proposed here, doth not mention any Conditions, upon which it is willing to make a Peace with his Electoral Serenity; whereas, on his behalf, there have been Proposals made to that end, both with relation to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> inso∣much that he knows not yet whether <HI>France</HI> will make any Peace with himself or no. The other, That the Conditions propos'd in that Project, with relation to <HI>Sweden,</HI> were so abject, and even so con∣trary to what their Hi. and Mi. have engaged them∣selves to procure his Electoral Serenity, that it must be believed, that <HI>France</HI> is not willing that a Peace should be made with <HI>Sweden,</HI> inasmuch as their Hi. and Mi. that see there is no room left for his Electo∣ral Serenity to enter into the Peace, in conjunction with themselves.</P>
<P>Finally, The said Ambassador promiseth to com∣municate the resolution of his Most Serene Master, upon the said Declaration of <HI>France,</HI> as soon as he
<PB N="155" REF="85"/> shall receive it, referring himself for other matters to his said Memorial.</P>

<P>THis Declaration could not be opened at large, because the President Canon had only formed the <HI>Idea</HI> of it in his mind, and return'd but the night before from the <HI>Hague;</HI> he alledged that Journey, as an excuse for his not having been pre∣sent at the last Conference, saying, that he went to deliver the Lords the States General a Letter from his Master. Then he enlarged upon the in∣justice of the Alternatives, that were proposed by <HI>France,</HI> as Conditions of Peace: The first, demand∣ing a Country 35 miles in length, and 16 or 18 in breadth, with 26 Cities upon it, and 600 Burroughs and Villages: The other, depriving him of his Capital City, and the convenience of communica∣tion with his own Country, by pretending to pass through some of the best of his High-ways. That both these Conditions were equally hard, he de∣monstrated by the Election that was left his Master to chuse either. For the avoiding such Imperious Laws, he referr'd himself to the Alliances made be∣tween their Imperial and Catholick Majesties, their Lordships the States General, and his late Uncle, and renewed since with his own person with all pos∣sible extension, and withal recommended himself to the friendship and protection of all his Allies, con∣cluding
<PB N="156" REF="86"/> with a formal protestation, that he would resolve rather to live banish'd from his Country, and entirely to maintain the Justice of his Title, and have his Allies that had contracted with him, con∣tinue under their absolute Engagements, than ever to return upon such hard Conditions, and so scan∣dalous to his Birth, and his undoubted Right of Succession, never having deserv'd so ill of <HI>France,</HI> as to be used so cruelly.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Remonstrance of the Ambassadors of the Elector of</HI> Brandenburg, <HI>to the Ambassadors of the Lords the</HI> States Ge∣neral, <HI>concerning the present Affairs of the Treaties of Peace. Given at</HI> Nime∣guen, <HI>this 31. of</HI> July, 1678.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ambassador of his Electoral Serenity of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> for the Treaties of Peace at <HI>Ni∣meguen,</HI> having seen the Memorial of the Lords Am∣bassadors of <HI>France,</HI> of the 17th. of <HI>July,</HI> wherein they endeavour to take away the Jealousies that might arise, of the sincerity of his Most Christian Majesty's Intentions, and of his faithfulness to his Word, concerning the evacuation of the Places, which he promised to restore to <HI>Spain,</HI> and to their Hi. and Mi. the Lords the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> thinks it fit, and according to his duty, to represent to the Lords the Ambassadors of the States General, who communicated to him the said Memorial: That as it is full of almost no∣thing
<PB N="159" REF="87"/> else, in every passage, but great Designs, of the Most Christian King, against his Electoral Sere∣nity, his Master, and other Princes, that have made some Conquests upon <HI>Sweden;</HI> so his Electoral Se∣renity promiseth himself, as well from the friend∣ship of the Lords the States, and their fidelity of Word, as from their justice and exactness, in per∣forming the terms of the Alliance, that they will not help forward such perniclous Designs, nor suf∣fer them to be put in execution, against one of their ancientest and most faithful Friend, Neighbour and Ally, and that has been no less concern'd, for the preservation and re-establishment of their Common∣wealth, than of his own Inheritances, and has not stuck at exposing, what-ever is most dear and pre∣cious to him in the whole World, for their sakes.</P>
<P>It is evident, with what care his Electoral Sereni∣ty hath governed all his Actions, so as not to give the least ground of discontent to <HI>Sweden;</HI> and the sincerity, with which he has renew'd former Allian∣ces with that Crown, is no less apparent, by his ap∣plying them even to the present Conjunctures, for the avoiding all manner of mis-understanding and rupture, which yet happened, by the violent Invasi∣on, made by the Army of <HI>Sweden,</HI> towards the end of the year, 1674. upon <HI>Marchia</HI> and <HI>Pomerania,</HI> directly against those, for whom such solemn Stipu∣lations had been, and contrary to the liberty, which each Party had reserv'd to themselves, in the said Alliance: Which Invasion was the more unjust, in∣asmuch as it was made at a time, when his Electoral Serenity, relying on the publick Faith, had sent his Forces so far off, that he was busie with them in <HI>Al∣satia.</HI> The Lords the States condemn'd and disliked this Proceeding no less, than all other Christian Po∣tentates
<PB N="160" REF="88"/> throughout <HI>Europe</HI> did; and God has made appear to all the World, by what has ensued, and by our marvellous success, that his powerful Hand is able to protect the innocent, and punish those that make so slight of Religion, Alliances, and Pro∣mises, that have had the sanction of the publick Faith. Their Hi. and Mi. and all others, without doubt, will agree, that it were an unheard of piece of cruelty, to deal with his Electoral Serenity, as he is threatned in that Memorial, for having made so vigorous and glorious an opposition, to so unjust and forcible an Invasion. The said Ambassador does not intend to lay open the weakness of the reason∣ings, in the said Memorial of the Ambassadors of <HI>France,</HI> assuring himself, that their Hi. and Mi. will not fail to expose it to the World, for the refutation of those, that for want of solid Reasons, have been forced to betake themselves, to such weak and groundless Arguments; since it appears, that there∣in they contradict, and directly thwart, what the Most Christian King has avow'd, and positively pro∣mised, by the Letters and Resolutions, which his Majesty has caused to be dispatched, and delivered to their Hi. and Mi. and to their Ministers. He will only represent, what wrong would be done to his Electoral Serenity, his Master, if their Hi. and Mi. should give ear to such Conditions, as conduce to no other end, but that of serving the Interest of a declared Enemy, by deserting a faithful Friend and Ally, and, at the same time, exposing their own Common-wealth, to the most dangerous hazard in the World, which they have endeavoured, out of their great prudence, and with so much care, to se∣cure and shelter, by means of a Bar in <HI>Flanders,</HI> which the Most Christian King himself thought
<PB N="161" REF="88"/> necessary for maintaining their repose, but which will stand them in no stead, if such another Bar be not likewise settled upon the Rhine. Certainly, there needs more then an ordinary assurance, to un∣dertake the perswading a whole Common-wealth, consisting of so many wise, and illustrious Members, to renounce whatever the Faith of their Alliances, and the true Interest of their own Common-wealth, re∣quires of them, and submit to such prejudicial Councels; and to further the suffering an Ally, and Neighbour, to be oppressed, that has given such extraordinary proofs of his Friendship to their State; and that in favour of a party, with whom at present they are engaged in open War, and that expresses by his excessive demands, so little of an inclination to come to such a reconciliation, as may be fair, and at all proportionable to the mischiefs, and inconveniences, that this fatal War has brought, and continues to bring upon Christendom. I shall leave the rest to the wise discussion of their Hi. and Mi. by reason of whose fidelity, affection, and Justice, his Electoral Serenity is well assured, that they will testifie in this occurrence, as great a passion for the security, and defence, of his Provinces of <HI>Cleve,</HI> which have always serv'd for a Bar; and whose preservation, has always been so very dear to them, as his Electoral Serenity has an affection to their Common-wealth upon so many occasions, and of which he has given such remarkable instances, especially, since the publick Faith, and the Welfare, and security of their own Estate, are equally con∣cern'd in the Interest of it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Protestation of the Ambassadors, and Plenipotentiaries, of the King of</HI> Denmark, <HI>the Elector of</HI> Brandenburg, <HI>&amp;c. against the separate Peace of the States General, of the</HI> United Provinces. <HI>Made the</HI> 10th. <HI>of</HI> Aug. 1678. <HI>at</HI> Nimeguen.</HEAD>
<P>THe Ambassadors, Plenipotentiaries, and Mini∣sters underwritten, understanding, with the utmost astonishment, that there was a likelihood of the Lords Ambassadors, of the States General, of the <HI>United Provinces;</HI> resolving to Sign this day, a separate Treaty of Peace, betwixt the Most Christian King, and their Hi. and Mi. which has been likewise confirm'd to them, by some of the said Ambassadors themselves, though hitherto, they have not made any communication of the Contents of their Project, nor held any particular Confe∣rence, upon a matter of so great consequence, in conformity to Treaties, by which their Hi. and Mi. are obliged so to do.</P>
<P>The said Ambassadors, and Plenipotentiary Mi∣nisters, have thought it their duty, to represent to the Lords Ambassadors, of their Hi. and Mi. the disagreement of this proceeding, with the Tenour of the Alliances, so solemnly struck with their Lords and Masters; wherein the Lords the States, pro∣mise upon their Word, and upon the credit of the publick Faith, never to think of making separate Treaties with their common Enemy, that was up∣on the point of overturning their Common-wealth,
<PB N="163" REF="89"/> and from whose oppression, they were saved onely by such assistances, and diversions, as were given from time to time in divers parts of the Empire, for their sakes.</P>
<P>Then they required with all the instances ima∣ginable, and conjur'd the said Lords Ambassadors, by what ever is held most sacred, and inviolable, not to precipitate the Signing this separate Peace, being directly opposite to the said Alliances, and to allow them a little time, to give their Lords and Masters necessary information: since that delay could not be at all prejudicial to them, and that request being but what every one might expect, from the publick Faith, and the sincerity of the Lords, the States General. They promise them∣selves the more assuredly, that both will be granted without any difficulty, especially, because there seems not to be any apparent necessity, why their Hi. and Mi. should take up a resolution, so con∣trary to all that they have taken, and concerted heretofore, and even after they had exhorted their Allies afresh to stedfastness, in the observance, and performance of the Treaties, and after the said Allies, our Lords and Masters, had taken vigo∣rous resolutions thereupon, and in compliance with their desires, had sent such numerous Forces into the heart of the <HI>Spanish Low-Countreys,</HI> to save <HI>Mons</HI> from the extremity, to which the Arms of <HI>France</HI> had reduced it, and to second and execute, what other designs, and exploits, <HI>Spain,</HI> and the State, under the conduct of his Highness, the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> should resolve upon, for the good of the common cause, and the safety of the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI> in particular.</P>
<PB N="164" REF="90"/>
<P>They have ordered moreover, some select Troops, that are now under march, to draw towards the <HI>Muse,</HI> and to be employ'd for the same purpose; so that with God's assistance, we have yet reason to hope for good success, in so just, and good a Cause.</P>
<P>However, if the Lords the States, should find themselves obliged, by some indispensable necessity, (the occasion and force whereof, is for all that un∣known to the Allies) to proceed with so much pre∣cipitation, to a separate Peace with <HI>France;</HI> the said Ambassadors, and Ministers, declare by this Memorial, that their Lords and Masters, are dis∣posed, and ready to enter with them into this Treaty, and to conclude a Peace with his Most Christian Majesty, in conjunction with the Lords, the States General, upon such honourable, and e∣quitable Conditions, as shall be agreed on, in a short time, towards the conclusion whereof, they will bring all manner of facility, and good offices, on their parts.</P>
<P>We promise our selves, that the said Lords Am∣bassadors, will not refuse so just and generous an offer; nor can we be perswaded, that the intention of their Hi. and Mi. is not exactly conformable to this just desire, or that they can so much as conceive a thought, of abandoning their good and faithful Friends, Neighbours, and Allies, that have em∣ployed what ever was most dear, and precious to them in the world, to save them from the ruine that threatned them, and to re-establish them in their former Liberty, and Splendour. At least, we promise our selves, from their Justice, and sinceri∣ty, that they will not conclude upon any thing, that shall not comprehend the Interests of their Allies, which in effect are their own, nor joyn in
<PB N="165" REF="90"/> the oppression, and ruine, of those that have so faithfully assisted them, against so powerful an Ene∣my; who on the one hand, makes so much show of the sincerity of his desire, to restore Peace to Christendom, and on the other, refuses to admit of such means, as are capable of procuring it; be∣sides that, this abandoning their Allies, and the Neutrality, that they pretend to settle, was not so much as required by the Most Christian King, in the platform of Conditions of Peace, which he Projected; the States, having always declared, against accepting the Cessation for six weeks, which the Most Christian-King afterwards offered; be∣cause the Neutrality, was made a Condition of it, which would have put them out of a possibility of assisting their Allies.</P>
<P>But if the worst came to the worst, and that not∣withstanding, all these just and equitable Remon∣strances, they will proceed to Sign a Treaty of this nature; the said Ambassadors, Plenipotentiaries, and Ministers of the High-Allies, can do no other, then solemnly, and most formally, to protest against this separate Treaty, as being directly contrary to the Al∣liances, and the solemn assurances, that have been given from time to time, of the stedfastness, and exactness, of their Hi. and Mi. in observing, and fulfilling their Treaties.</P>
<P>They challenge them likewise for all the misfor∣tunes, inconveniences, losses, and dammages, that all Christendom in general, and their Lords and Masters, each in particular, may suffer by this sepa∣ration, and the non-observance of Alliances, so solemnly, and sacredly contracted, saving to them∣selves all their right, by vertue of those Alliances, by the Law of Nations, and that of God and Man,
<PB N="166" REF="91"/> submitting to the sound, and disinteressed judgment of all the World, the wrong done to their Lords and Masters, contrary to all promises, engagements, Treaties, and that without any necessity, by a pro∣cedure equally rash, and unheard of, in a time when God gives us hopes of redress, in a more de∣cent, and reasonable way; they challenge them, as those, that out of blind passions, and prepossess'd sentiments, even against their opinion, who are animated with a more generous sense of honour, and the consideration of their own engagements, to a rational stedfastness, sacrifice the honour, and glory of their party, to proceedings unworthy a State that is governed by reason, and Justice; by which manner of acting, they contract such a stain, as will never wear out of the memory of mankind.</P>

<P>THe Counsellor, and Envoy Extraordinary, of his Majesty, the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> &amp;c.

(after your Ambassadors having Signed a separate Peace with those of <HI>France,</HI> at <HI>Ni∣meguen,</HI> concerning which, they refer themselves to the protestations, there made by the Ministers, of all the High-Allies, and to the Memorials which they have presented here, to the Lords, your Hi. and Mi.

<P>But, because they find with great sorrow, that many things are Negociated, and Treated, betwixt your Hi. and Mi. and the common Enemy of the Allies, of which the High-Allies, have no timely notice beforehand; the parties underwritten, have thought themselves bound, to remonstrate to your Hi. and Mi. how contrary such proceedings are, to the very words of the Alliances, and not knowing for
<PB N="168" REF="92"/> want of due communication, the truth of the news, which the Enemies give out, of this engagement, pretended to be entred into, by your Hi. and Mi. to <HI>Sweden,</HI> for a Cessation of Arms; they have thought fit, in discharge of their own duty, to put your Hi. and Mi. in mind of the very words of the Treaties, which in the <HI>18th.</HI> Article run thus; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q>That the Allies, shall from time to time, com∣municate to one another, what advances, or pro∣posals soever, shall be made at the Negociations of Peace, or Truce.</Q>
<P>And a little before,</P>
<Q>That the States General, shall not make any Truce with the Enemy, otherwise then in conjun∣ction, and by common consent.</Q>
<P>And they conjure them, by all that is sacred in solemn Treaties, and publick Faith, not to ad∣mit of so notorious a contravention, on their part, to the said Treaties, in this point of a Truce, with∣out a justifiable reason, or urgent necessity.</P>
<P>The parties underwritten, being moreover o∣bliged, to enter solemn protests, in the names, and on the behalf of their Masters, in case, contrary to all expectation, this Cessation of Arms shall fall out, to be separately agreed upon with <HI>Sweden</HI> already, and in like manner, with relation to all other nego∣tiations, and engagements, against the Tenour of the Treaties, that say, and require expresly,</P>
<Q>That not any of the Parties, shall come to any conclusion of a Peace, without comprehending their Allies.</Q>
<P>We promise our selves, that your Hi. and Mi. ac∣cording to your great knowledge, and the exactness, with which you have used inviolably, to observe the
<PB N="169" REF="92"/> tenor of your Treaties, will be pleased to make re∣flexion, upon what the parties under-written have now alledged, so as not to ratifie what has been con∣cluded at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> with the Ambassadors of <HI>France,</HI> as being inconsistent with the said Engagements, which, without doubt, will confirm all the Poten∣tates of <HI>Europe,</HI> in the confidence which they have hitherto placed in your Hi. and Mi. concerning the fulfilling your promises made upon the publick Faith. However, the Ministers under-written, find themselves obliged to reserve to their Lords and Masters their Right, as well by the Law of Nations, as in pursuance of the fore-mentioned Treaties, clearing them at the same time, from what-ever in∣conveniences and misfortunes, this manner of pro∣ceeding may produce, both to the prejudice of the common Cause, and each of their particular Inte∣rests.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Memorial of the Ambassadors of</HI> Denmark, <HI>and of the Elector of</HI> Bran∣denburg, <HI>given in to those of the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>of the 22. of</HI> August.</HEAD>
<P>THE Glory which the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> has always acquired, and maintain'd hitherto, without the least imputation, by its stedfastness and constancy, by its fidelity to its Allies, and by its religious ad∣hering to its Faith, leaves the under-written Am∣bassadors,
<PB N="170" REF="93"/> Plenipotentiaries, and Ministers of the High Allies, no room to doubt, but that it will yet continue in the same generous Sentiments, and transmit this Reputation to posterity, which all for∣mer Ages have been obliged to publish in its ho∣nour.</P>
<P>But because, since the unforeseen signing of the Peace betwixt <HI>France,</HI> and the Lords the States Ge∣neral, the most glorious opportunity has presented it self, that ever could have happened, to signalize this honourable firmness, and purchase a new splen∣dor and lustre to the said Monarchy, the said parties under-written would not be wanting to make use of it, to represent to their Excellencies, the Lords Am∣bassadors of his Catholick Majesty, at this Congress, that their Lords and Masters can promise themselves no less, from the justice and equity of theirs, by their former experience, than the like behaviour upon the present occasion; to the end, that all the World may judge with them, that Fidelity is the most precious Diadem of a well-ordered State, which no force can invade, no adversity pervert, no neces∣sity bereave it of; and that they justly and undoubt∣edly expect to see those defects, that rather by the unfortunate constitution of Affairs, than out of any ill will, have hitherto intervened, in divers Articles of the Treaties, that are betwixt his Catholick Ma∣jesty and themselves, made up by this unshaken constancy; so as his Majesty will not in any sort se∣parate or loosen himself from those, that have not feared to expose themselves on the very brink of a precipice, and to throw themselves into the most dangerous events, wherein they yet continue, for his sake, and to draw his Countries, in these Parts, out of the gulf that was about to swallow them up.
<PB N="171" REF="93"/> The said parties under-written can assure their said Excellencies, upon their certain knowledge, and by their express Orders, that their Lords and Masters are entirely disposed, and ready to take part with theirs, and with all those that shall now think it their interest, or will be willing yet to joyn in the defence of so just a Cause, as the common Cause is, and in the establishment of the publick safety, in all the hazards, perils, and dangerous events, that the Divine Providence shall be pleased to ordain, whe∣ther the event should fall out to be that of accom∣plishing so just a Design, by a general, a just, and a reasonable Peace, or whether the Enemy should be so hard, as to make the obtaining it, stick upon im∣practicable conditions and demands, and expose it to the continuance of a longer and a fiercer War.</P>
<P>Not any of our Lords and Masters ever refused to take such courses, as reason and decency have esta∣blished between Soveraign Princes, to arrive at the first; they will yet joyfully embrace them, and will demonstrate by their readiness and facility, that the Quiet of Christendom is the only object of all their wishes: But since it is evident to all the World, that the Enemies have hitherto refused to admit of any, but would prescribe Laws to us, rather than suffer us to treat upon terms in order to it, it is easily discovered not to be their fault, that at present we are all involv'd in the latter.</P>
<P>A rational stedfastness is only capable of redressing these mischiefs, and of bringing them back to more just and decent Measures, that have been led aside out of the way of their Duty and Engagements, by the secret Cabals of some private Persons, and the
<PB N="172" REF="94"/> violence and inadvertence of some Men of fickle minds, that know not how dear and precious Faith and Truth ought to be to a free State; when they shall take notice, that his Majesty is far from follow∣ing so pernicious an example, and will keep faith∣fully to the Letter of the mutual Treaties, out of which your Excellencies will find some necessary Ex∣tracts hereunto annexed, and let the World see, that he chuseth rather to run the same fortune with his Allies to the very last, than unmercifully to desert them, contrary to all sacredness of promises, and only to save himself to their cost, by a notorious breach of such solemn Alliances.</P>
<P>His Majesty can lose nothing by this means, but will be a gainer, by maintaining his Glory, his Ho∣nour, and his Reputation. The Bar that is setled for bounds to the Conquests of <HI>France,</HI> is rather a large career for it, to drive on its Designs in, as far as it listeth. All that is left the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> serves rather to exhaust his Treasures, for the little time that he shall be per∣mitted to enjoy it peaceably, than to give him any assurance of a setled possession. And when they shall have loosen'd the sacred Band of the Allies, and dis∣armed the neighbouring Estates, who will hinder the rest from falling under the dominion of a foreign Power, when-ever the Enemy shall have a mind to it? Certainly, they that for their good will, and all their endeavours, and all the hazards to which they have expos'd themselves, shall find themselves now either evil-entreated by their Friends, or desert∣ed by their Allies, and so ill rewarded for their affe∣ction and good will, will be wiser at another time, when the fire shall be greater, than to run to quench it, and every one will content himself to provide for
<PB N="173" REF="94"/> his own safety, when he shall consider, how unwor∣thily he has been recompenced, for what he has now done for that of the Publick.</P>
<P>But the strength of all these Arguments is so well known, to their Excellencies aforesaid, that it would be superfluous to alledge new ones. They know ve∣ry well, how necessary it is, for all that are concern'd in the Interest of the preservation of the <HI>Low-Coun∣tries,</HI> not to let them utterly sink, what-ever may be pretended outwardly. The Enemy's Arms have already got too fast hold of these Rampiers, of the neighbouring Estates, for us to imagine, that they can be contented to see them entirely lost. For this cause the Ambassadors, Plenipotentiaries, and Mi∣nisters under-written, will not enlarge upon the de∣bate of these Matters. They are only bound in duty, to conjure your Excellencies, by the sacredness of reciprocal Engagements, by the force of mutual Al∣liances, by the Faith of the King your Master, and by the Glory and the Honour of your Nation and Country, not to make any step on the present occa∣sion, that may be prejudicial to their Lords and Masters, or be injurious to your own, or your selves, since we are perswaded, you never will leave this Vi∣ctory to the common Enemies, of being superior to the King your Master in constancy, and stedfastness to their Allies, though Destiny may by the fortune of War, have made his condition at present some∣what worse than theirs.</P>
<P>This is what the Parties under-written do most in∣stantly beseech your Excellencies, not only to consi∣der your selves with mature deliberation, but duely∣to report it where 'tis proper, that we may both know, that these things have been represented in time, and promise our selves such resolutions and effects, as
<PB N="174" REF="95"/> are worthy so great a King as yours, and becom∣ing such zealous, clear-fighted, and wise Ministers, as every one knows your Excellencies are.</P>
