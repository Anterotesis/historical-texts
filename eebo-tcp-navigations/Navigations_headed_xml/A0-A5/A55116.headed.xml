<P><HI>HInde</HI> being taken Prisoner by the young Gentleman and Serving-man, thought it good to go quietly with them, that so he might be the better able to make an es∣cape when he saw occasion; and said, <HI>Sir, I am now your Prisoner pray let me know whi∣ther you are riding,</HI> Quoth he, but to a Gentlemans house about two miles off, to dine with some friends, whither I intend you shall march; quoth <HI>Hinde, I beleeve there be some Gentlemen gone before will be glad to see me.</HI> You shall be civilly used, quoth the Gentleman, and dine with us, and then shall I deliver you to the Justice. They being come to the house, Dinner being set, the Master of the house saluted <HI>Hinde,</HI> and bad him welcom, as the young Gentlemans friend, and caused him to sit downe at Table; <HI>Hinde</HI> takes a glass of wine in his hand, and drinks to all the Company, especially to those of his acquaintance (as he called them) whom he had robbed in the morning: quoth the old Penifather, <HI>Couldst thou not be content with so good a breakefast but must thou come and affront my son and me at Dinner?</HI> At which words the whole businesse was under∣stood, and the one said, he was robbed of so much, and another of so much and all ac∣knowledged what they had lost. <HI>I thank ye all Gentlemen,</HI> quoth Hinde, <HI>for my break∣fast; but I am most engaged to this Gentleman, for he would not let me passe till he brought me to a plentifull Dinner.</HI> Much mirth past at the Table, and <HI>Hinde</HI> fitted them with very good discourse for the day; That pleased the company so well, that each man endeavour∣ed to shew him what favour they could; so that after Dinner they took him out into the Court, where the Master of the House had a gallant young Gelding never backt be∣fore that day, which war very unruly, and had thrown two or three Riders; quoth

<P>THere is no game comes rmiss, but <HI>Hinde</HI> hath skill in it, in his low estate he hath his conceits, and now he is a pretended Lord, here he shall shew you how he sends some of his Comradoes in the habit of Serving men to take up a Lodging for their Ma∣ster in an Inn, telling that ee was a great Lord, and was desirous to lye there about some businesse, but withall they told him he must have extraordinary fare, as Rabbits and Chickens, and all other dainties, no Butchers meat would go down with him, and to co∣lour the businesse, he sent him two great Iron bound Chests, with strong locks, and mai∣led with corys, and gave order they should be put in the best room in the House, as if there had been some rich businesse in it: So when the Lodging was fitted, the next day comes in <HI>Hinde</HI> like a great Lord, or <HI>Don of Spaine,</HI> and was weleomed by the Host with a great deal of respect and honor, nothing was omitted that might any way give him content, And thus he continued for some certaine time; for he went out upon his Rob∣bery, and came in again in his Coach, and none suspected or mistrusted; and when he thought he had laine there long enough, for feare of discovery he took an occasion to burrow threescore pounds of his Host, pretending some extraordinary businesse; the credulous Host beleeves him, and lends it him, he having (as he thought) such good good security; But the Bird being now slegged, it is time to take wing and be gone,) <HI>Hinde</HI> goes out in the morning in his Coach, but was too w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se to come any more there; he is expected at night; but no Lord comes, his Lordship was gone another progresse; he stayes a week, and appeares not, a Moneth expires and he is not seen.

<HEAD><HI>4</HI> How <HI>Hinde</HI> cozened a Merchant in <HI>Holland</HI> of <HI>300</HI> Crowns, by giving a counterfeit Chain for a pledge.</HEAD>
<P>THis jovial Gamster, <HI>Hinde,</HI> being in <HI>Holland,</HI> having spent his mony, casts his wits about how to recrute himself, and you know good Workmen never want their toos: You may remember I told you how he served the Inn keeper, just almost in the same manner he beguiles the Dutchmen; he goes after the fashion of a Gallant, the better to set a glosse upon his knavery; he hath his man to wait upon him, and by his gallant garb insinuates into a rich Merchants acquaintance, makes the World beleeve he hath brought the wealth of the Indies with him, he pretends he hath great wealth, and happy were he that could be acquainted with him, for it is the nature of the Dutchmen to strike sail for their own profit, to offer any kindnesse where they perceive they may
<PB N="5" REF="3"/> be any way a gainer. Amongst the rest, a Merchant of no mean quality perceiving his deportment; invites him to his house; this Gudgeon with little intreaty quickly swal∣lowes the Bait, and accepts his proffer: when come to his house, the Merchant enter∣tains him with a great deal of civility. <HI>Hind</HI> pretends to send one of his men to his two Chests which were aboard of a ship in the Key, for some money, which made the Mer∣chant say, Sir, <HI>I much wonder you being a stranger, dare trust your Wealth in such a place; if you please Sir, my house shall be at your pleasure.</HI> But <HI>Hind</HI> takes an occasion upon dis∣course to pull out of a Box a Chain of pure Gold before the Merchant, which he much admiring said, Sir, you need not want money so long as you have this to engage. <HI>Hind</HI> replyed, I should be loath to engage it but upon necessity; which I am now driven to. For although I have money, yet I cannot command it, because I must pay it presently upon a Bill of Exchange.</P>

<P><HI>HInd</HI> had many wifts, when put to a pinch, he sent some of his Comrades in the ha∣bit of serving-men to take up lodging for their Master in an Inne, telling the Inne-keeper, there was a great Lord to lie there about some businesse for some time, and wished him to provide the best cheere could be devised, for he cared not for Butchers meat; and to colour the businesse, he sent two great iron Chests bounds and corded a∣bout, as if some rich Treasure were in them, and gave order they should be set in the best room in the house; so when the lodging was fitted, the next day came in <HI>Hind</HI> like a great Lord, or Don of <HI>Spain,</HI> in his Coach, attended by two Lacquaies,, and two Ser∣ving-men, having extraordinary respect from the Master of the house, and so continu∣ed for a certaine time, going in and out upon his robberies, but (having been there a∣bout a moneth, paying for what he had) the Host mistrusted nothing, he coming in and out in his Coach in that manner: <HI>Hind</HI> took an occasion to borrow threescore pounds of his Host, pretending some extraordinary businesse, and goes out in the morning in his Coach, but came in no more: his Host thought he had been gone into the Coun∣trey and would returne againe, and consequently mistrusted not, because he conceived he had so good a pledge: but after he had been about a moneth absent, he made bold to open the chests, wherein was nothing but stones and brick-bats; So <HI>Hind</HI> had royall entertainment, and money too boot.</P>

<Q><L>A Watch in Tavern lost? Oh, that's a crime:</L>
<L>See how in drinking men do lose their time.</L>
<L>The string hang out, and you forget to lock it,</L>
<L>And so the Watch did slip out of your pocket.</L>

<L>Pocket your Watch, but watch your Pocket too:</L></Q>
