<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hereas by an Acte of Parliament made in the two and twentieth</HI> yeere of the Reigne of Our most noble Progenitour King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; It was (amongst other things) ordeined, that all Merchants which should carie or bring any merchandize out of Scotland, or the Isles of the same into this Realme of England or Wales, first should bring the same merchandize to the Towne of <HI>Berwicke:</HI> And that none of the Kings liege people, nor none other person vnder the Kings obey∣sance should carie any merchandize, or cause it to bee carried into this Realme of England, or any other place vnder the Kings obeysance: But that the same merchan∣dize should be customed at the same Towne of <HI>Berwicke,</HI> except to the Citie of <HI>Carlile,</HI> and the Ports or Creekes pertaining to the West Marches: And that no merchandize should bee shipped in any Creeke, or other place betwixt <HI>Tinmouth</HI> and the said Towne of <HI>Berwicke;</HI> but onely in the Port or Hauen of the said Towne of <HI>Berwicke:</HI> And that if any person or persons should offend, or do with any maner merchandize aforesaid, contrary to any of the said ordinances, the same person or per∣sons should forfeit all the said merchandize, and that it should be lawfull to any of the Kings liege Subiects to seize all such merchandize so forfeited, or else to pursue in his owne name an Action of debt against the same person or persons which so should forfeit, conteining the summe of the va∣lue of the said goods, and the King to haue aswell the one halfe of all such merchandize forfeited and seized, as the one halfe of all such summes of money, which should be recouered by the Action in the forme aforesaid, to bee pursued for the value of any such goods so forfeit, and the person or persons which should seize, and pursue in the forme aforesaid, to haue the other halfe of the same, as by the same Acte of Parliament (amongst other things) more at large appeareth.</P>
<P>And whereas We were giuen to vnderstand in the first yeere of our Reigne of our Realme of England, that since our entrie into this Kingdome, many of our subiects of our Realme of Scot∣land, and some also of England did not obserue the same Acte of Parliament, but to the intent to defraud vs of our said Customes, did goe with their goods and merchandizes ouer the Felles, and other by-passages, whereby great damage was then done to vs:</P>
<P>And whereas Wee, for that cause at that time did by our Proclamation straitly charge and command all Our Subiects, aswell of the one Realme as of the other, that none of them should presume after that time to passe any goods from each Realme to other, but either shipped at some knowen Port, or else through Our said citie of <HI>Carlile,</HI> or Towne of <HI>Berwicke,</HI> as by the same Procla∣mation may also appeare.</P>
<PB REF="2"/>
<PB REF="2"/>
<P>And whereas We haue beene pleased of long time to forbeare to take any Customes, or other Duties, of any of Our Subiects of Scotland, for any goods passing betwixt Our said King∣domes, vntill now of late: During which time, Our Subiects did obserue aswell the said Acte of Parliament, as the said Proclamation: And forasmuch, as We are now againe informed, that Our said Subiects, since We haue giuen order to Our Officers to receaue Our Customes, for goods so caried betweene both Our said Kingdomes, doe now againe goe with their goods and merchandize ouer the said fels, and other by-passages, and ship the same at secret, obscure, and vnknowen places, aswell to the great damage and losse vnto Vs, in Our Customes and Subsi∣dies, as vnto Our Subiects, both of this Our Realme of England, and also of Our Realme of Scotland, both by carying of goods prohibited to be caried out of this Our Realme into Our said Realme of Scotland, and from thence into the forreine parts: and also by bringing of goods prohibited to be caried out of Our said Realme of Scotland, into this Our Realme of England, and from hence carying the same into other forreine parts.</P>
<P>We minding to take away all such excuses as may be made in that behalfe, doe therefore by these presents make it knowen to all Our louing Subiects, that We doe intend to haue the same Acte of Parliament, and all others of like effect put in strait execution in all things aboue menti∣oned, for and concerning land carriages, and such goods as shall be shipped at such secret, obscure, and vnknowen places, and to haue the same very carefully obserued, performed, fulfilled, and kept, to the onely end, that We, or Our Fermours may be truely answered of Our due customes, Subsidies, and other duties due for such goods.</P>
<P>And for that purpose, We doe heereby authorize, and straitly charge, will and require, aswell Our Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, &amp; other Our Officers, in Our Ports and Custome houses; As also all Our Lieuetennants, Deputie Lieuetenants, Maiors, Sheriffes, Bayliffes, Constables, and other Our Officers, Ministers, and Subiects whatsoeuer, whom it shall con∣cerne, not onely to see to the due execution of the same Acte of Parliament themselues, to their best knowledge and skill: but also to be aiding and assisting to all others, that shall endeauour to see the same put in execution, as is fit; as they will answere the contrary at their vttermost perills.</P>
