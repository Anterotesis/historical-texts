<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Old Distemper returning sud∣denly upon me, I could not wait on you as I design'd, and see you on Ship-board: Yet my hearty Prayers and Well-wishes have, and shall ever attend you, for the good Success of your Travels, and safe Return. I think my self also obliged to congratu∣late your happy Voyage, and hopeful Settlement (and as I am informed) in a flourishing and well-govern'd <HI>Universi∣ty;</HI> where you cannot want Means and Opportunities to improve your Parts considerably, and enrich your Soul with such excellent Habits, as none of your Rank and Years may out-do you in the most desirable Accomplishments of Know∣ledge, Wisdom and Experience.</P>
<P>But (Sir,) besides those many Obli∣gations which I shall always recognize with the greatest Expressions of Love and Gratitude, I have several other Mo∣tives
<PB REF="3"/>and Inducements, (as you'll see in the Sequel of this <HI>Epistle,</HI>) which have prompted me to give you the trouble of perusing these following <HI>Sheets:</HI> And tho I am very sensible, that you cannot want the <HI>Counsel</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> of Men far more eminent for <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Ob∣servation</HI> than I durst ever pretend to; yet my Endeavours may have their de∣sired Influence (and kind Acceptance) as the Effect of undissembled Love and Fi∣delity, and the Product of his retired and serious Thoughts, who (to his power) ever was, is, and, God willing, shall be a true Friend to your Self and Family.</P>
<P>Yet I must beg leave to tell you, (be∣fore I proceed to the subject Matter of this <HI>Epistle,</HI>) that the Eyes of your <HI>Country</HI> are much upon you, as the hopeful <HI>Son</HI> of such a <HI>Father;</HI> and there∣fore you must expect, as your Accomplish∣ments, so your Defects will be narrowly and critically observed. You must there∣fore either study to equal, and (if pos∣sible) out-do his eminent <HI>Vertues</HI> and <HI>Endowments,</HI> or otherwise you'll find that they'll exceedingly lessen and e∣clipse
<PB REF="3"/>your own. Besides, you have left your Country, Relations and Friends, for the increase of Learning and Experience; we do all therefore hope to see the generous and worthy Fruits and Effects of your Care and Industry, and as great a change in your <HI>Person</HI> as in the <HI>Climate.</HI> Nor can it be much satisfaction to your self or others, tho you be able to give an account (at your return) of the strange <HI>Occurren∣ces</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Event:</HI> For, the Fruits of <HI>Study</HI> and <HI>Travel</HI> should not rest there, but your chief business will be to culti∣vate and beautifie your Soul with such useful and profitable Knowledge, as may be a future benefit both to your self and others; nor can any thing less than this, counter vail the great Charge, Hazzards, and Fatigues of <HI>Travel.</HI></P>
<P>You should also consider (Sir,) that your Co-temporaries here are growing up apace, and may be great <HI>Proficients</HI> in all sorts of Learning; and therefore as you'll have greater Opportunities, so you must endeavour to make a sutable Im∣provement in all the gentiel, ingenuous and vertuous Accomplishments, both of
<PB REF="4"/>Mind and Body. But if by their Dili∣gence they should out-strip you, it would be no little Reflection; not to mention the fruitless expence of Time and Money, and the far greater Hazzards you run upon amongst <HI>Foreigners</HI> and <HI>Fugitives.</HI></P>
<P>Nor will it be unseasonable to remark to you, that several <HI>Young Gentlemen</HI> (within the compass of your own observa∣tion,) have returned from beyond <HI>Sea's,</HI> as ignorant to the full, and more immoral and extravagant, than if they had never left the Smoak of their own Chimneys. They have indeed dearly purchased, and brought over with them some new <HI>Modes,</HI> affected <HI>Gestures,</HI> (if not the Diseases of the Country,) and such Language and Deportment as are not only ungentiel and unbecoming, but unmanly and unchri∣stian: (We shall have occasion to take notice of some <HI>Particulars</HI> afterwards;) insomuch that they are so far from being either wiser, or better for their <HI>Travels,</HI> that (to give them their due) they have only commenced <HI>Masters</HI> of that <HI>hellish</HI> and <HI>black Art</HI> of <HI>Debauchery, Irreligion</HI> and <HI>Profaneness.</HI> But,</P>
<PB REF="4"/>
<P>These Examples (Sir,) are only noted by way of <HI>caution:</HI> For we know, and shall always hope for, and expect better Things and Fruits from you: And your virtuous <HI>Temper,</HI> and hither to religious <HI>Education,</HI> will be a Sovereign <HI>Antidote,</HI> and sure <HI>Defensitive</HI> against all the dan∣gerous and charming <HI>Illectives</HI> you can possibly meet with. To which give me leave to add the following <HI>Advice,</HI> which I hope may be useful to you in all your <HI>Tra∣vels;</HI> nor shall it be unseasonable, whilst you continue in that well govern'd <HI>Socie∣ty,</HI> where perhaps the least Danger is neither fear'd nor suspected.</P>
<P>Not to trouble you with a longer <HI>Ex∣ordium:</HI> What I have further to impart, shall for Methods sake, be comprehended under these <HI>Three</HI> following <HI>Heads of Discourse.</HI> And the</P>
<P>First, will respect the well-husbanding and management of your <HI>Time</HI> in attend∣ing your <HI>Studies,</HI> or <HI>Conversation</HI> with others. The</P>
<P>Second, <HI>Your Morals,</HI> and <HI>Civil De∣portment.</HI> And the</P>
<P>Third, <HI>Your Religion.</HI></P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>In all which I shall endeavour to lay down such <HI>Rules,</HI> as I hope may direct and encourage you to imploy your <HI>Time</HI> to the best Purposes; so that you may go on chearfully in your <HI>Business,</HI> with the greatest success, delight and satisfaction; and return home thro' Gods Blessing, every way accomplisht, as a well-bred <HI>Gentle∣man,</HI> a good <HI>Scholar,</HI> and a sound <HI>Chri∣stian.</HI> All which would be the greatest Comfort and Blessing to your <HI>Parents,</HI> an Ornament to your <HI>Country,</HI> and the most peculiar Happiness to your <HI>Self.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A LETTER OF ADVICE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN Now in His TRAVELS Beyond the SEA'S, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> PART I. <HI>Of STƲDIES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW (Sir) it would be an ill and unaccountable Application of your <HI>Time,</HI> if your <HI>Quality</HI> (as we
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>have seen in too many) should make you impatient of Discipline and Re∣straint, or make you consult your Li∣berty and Ease; the Effects whereof are usually dangerous and destructive. For since God has blessed and ennobled you with the Priviledges of Birth and Blood, and an ingenuous and religi∣ous Education, you should imploy your Time and Faculties in the search of, and pursuit after those things which now, and in the after-course of your Life, will afford you the greatest Ad∣vantages, as well as Pleasure and De∣light. You must not fancy then, that God made you only for Sports and Pastimes, but gentiel and heroic Exer∣cises: Let those who understand no better, please and divert themselves with their Horses, Dogs, Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But what are all these to the more noble and worthy Endowments of a Gentle∣man and a Scholar? And seeing God has been pleased to bless you with the understanding and all other Faculties of a Man (and those too in the best degree) imploy the most considerable part of
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>your Time (especially now whilst you have Leisure, Opportunity, and few Avocations) at your <HI>Book,</HI> and in your <HI>Study.</HI> For,</P>
<P>First, As this will adorn your Soul with the greatest Treasures this World can afford, so you'l have cause to con∣gratulate to your self your own Hap∣piness, and God Almighty will bless and prosper you in your Endeavours: Who even in <HI>Paradise</HI> would not al∣low Pleasure to the first <HI>Adam</HI> (tho certainly as Noble as any of his De∣scendents) without Labour and Industry. Nor can your retired and seeming Ob∣scurity in your <HI>Studies</HI> lessen your Gentility, since there's no well-bred <HI>Scholar</HI> that can fail of the Reputa∣tion and Character of a Gentleman. But besides,</P>
<P>Secondly, You'l hereby become not only more courteous and obliging to all you converse with, but more ca∣pable also of managing (with Prudence and Discretion) those weighty Affairs which may await you at your Return; and your Birth and Education will in∣title
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>you to, both of Justice and State. Besides, you'l better understand what Respect and Encouragement is defer∣vedly due to Learned Men, (such I mean as are diligent, sober and pious) and herein your dear and worthy <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> may be a Pattern to you, who by his discreet and obliging Carriage, has extreamly endear'd himself to all Scholars, but the Orthodox Clergy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> especially. And hence 'tis very observable, that those Gentlemen only who have purchased to themselves the honour of Learning and true Breeding, know best how to value and esteem, and are most willing to encourage those Attainments in others; which will also have a mighty Influence upon all your Dependents, as well as others below you, who do usually ei∣ther respect or contemn wise and good Men, by the Examples of their <HI>Lea∣ders.</HI> Consider,</P>
<P>Thirdly, That whereas the Vertues or Vices of private Men do common∣ly pass without much Notice or Cen∣sure, you'l beset as it were a <HI>Beacon</HI> up∣on
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>an Hill; and as the Words of great Men are usually <HI>Maxims</HI> and <HI>Theorems,</HI> so their Actions become Examples, Rules and Presidents for others to steer and walk by. Besides, you'l be no less esteemed and admired for the Excellen∣cy of your natural and acquired Abili∣ties, than herein for the sway and in∣fluence of your Authority; nor can any thing be more base and inglorious, than a Gentleman only by name, whose Soul is ignorant and Life immoral.</P>
<P>Fourthly, There's nothing in this World, which can countervail the great Expence of your Time and Pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> (as before) which are only attainable by <HI>Study</HI> and a sutable <HI>Conversation</HI> with Scholars and Men of Parts; for hereby you may be qualified both for Action and Speculation, and excel the <HI>Mobile</HI> as much in Understanding and Vertue, as Nobility of Birth and gentiel Extraction. Now, these are the genuine and proper Fruits of <HI>Education and Study;</HI> and un∣less you imploy and improve your Time and Faculties to these purposes, tho per∣haps
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>you may gratifie and please your Fancy with vain and empty Delights, yet your Understanding will prove un∣fruitful; and after many tedious and dangerous <HI>Traverses,</HI> you may return Home with a shatter'd Body, and a bar∣ren and empty Soul.</P>
<P>These are all such generous <HI>Induce∣ments,</HI> as will prevail with your ingenu∣ous Temper and Inclination, to keep close to your <HI>Studies:</HI> But as a further Obligation and Inforcement, give me leave to remind you of the <HI>Miscarriages</HI> of some (who would neither be persua∣ded to love Learning nor Books) which may be a sure <HI>Caution</HI> to you to avoid those Sins and Indiscretions of licenti∣ous and ungovern'd Youth.</P>
<P>For alass! we have many deplorable Instances (the Sparks and Blades of our Age) who consume their Time, Parts, Wit, Estates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in pursuit of the greatest Fooleries and Vanities in the World, to the greatest shame and disgrace of them∣selves, and scandal of others; as if they were a distinct <HI>Species</HI> from all Rational Beings, and made only for a Sword, or
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>a Horse, or a Dog, and the other brutish and sensual Exercises of Luxury and Profaneness. I am no Enemy to mode∣rate and innocent Pleasures; but those <HI>Sots</HI> and <HI>Ignaro's</HI> make it their Trade and way of Living, to observe all Modes and Fashions, drink, swear, curse, whore, game, sight and quarrel like Hectors and Madmen, despise and scorn all be∣low them, and run on in a full Carreer of Sin and Extravagance.</P>
<P>Insomuch, that I'm afraid they have scarce leisure to say their Prayers, or look on a Book, and therefore wholly unfit for Christian or ingenuous Con∣verse; (their Dogs, Horses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being usually the Subjects of their <HI>Discourse</HI> in their more serious Intervals). By all which inhuman Methods, many of them are become so barbarously Ignorant, and void of all Learning, that they have al∣most forgot that ever they were at <HI>Schools</HI> or <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> (unless they hap∣pen to remember some <HI>Pranks</HI> they play'd there) and are as much strangers to <HI>Humanity, Philosophy, History, &amp;c.</HI> as if there had been never any such thing
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>as Books or Learning in the World.</P>
<P>Nor are these the Faults only of our home-bred Gentlemen; (for we have many learned, wise, and good Men, who never had the Curiosity nor Convenience of Travel) but even of those who have seen many Foreign Countries, Cities, Delights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet neglecting the Busi∣ness they went about (as we have obser∣ved already) have returned home after many impertinent Wandrings, more vain and prodigal, wicked and irreligi∣ous, than those Companions of Igno∣rance and Epicurism they left behind them. For what pleasure and satisfacti∣on has that Man, who has seen all the Novelties and Curiosities in the World, if he has studied nothing else but to please and pamper his own Appetite? All that we can say of him, is, that he has bestowed much pains to no purpose, or for that which is worse; and bought his Sins and Vanities at a dearer rate than others.</P>
<P>Thus, I have set before you those <HI>Ar∣guments</HI> and <HI>Motives,</HI> and <HI>Dangers</HI> and <HI>Hazards,</HI> on the right hand and on the
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>left, which your <HI>Prudence</HI> will consider betimes; so, that you may improve all those Opportunities that fall in your way to the best advantages, lest you should unhappily <HI>miscarry</HI> in your great <HI>Adventure,</HI> (as those miserable Instan∣ces we have already noted; which the Lord of his great mercy avert.</P>
<P>Consider again, that your Station, Quality and Parts, may dispose you at your Return for Offices of Honour and Trust; wherein you may be highly Serviceable to your King and Country, as your <HI>worthy Father</HI> is, and has been before you: Nor can any <HI>Magistrate</HI> be duly qualified to administer Justice or Counsel, with ease and satisfaction to himself, or for the benefit of others, but by such habitual Accomplishments as are the proper Results of <HI>Study</HI> and <HI>Observation:</HI> Insomuch that <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> Emperour, did solemnly de∣clare, <HI>That he had rather abound in Knowledge than Riches and Honour.</HI></P>
<P>But besides those foregoing <HI>Topicks,</HI> you'l find by <HI>Experience,</HI> that the Plea∣sures as well as the Benefits of <HI>Study,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>are so charming and delightful, that 'tis next to impossible for a <HI>Scholar</HI> to be idle: Especially considering (as a Learn∣ed Man observes) the many Improve∣ments of Reason, the sweetness and de∣lights of Knowledge, the great range and multitude of Thoughts and Specu∣lations; for there's much wit in Poe∣try, in Philosophy Reason, improved, in Mathematicks Acuteness, in History curious and strange Events, in Politicks variety of Projects and Designs, in Ora∣tory sweet and delightful Eloquence, in Divinity supernatural Light, Rules of holy Living and Dying, and heavenly Devotions: Which last will be a means to sanctifie all Endeavours to your use, and make all your other <HI>Studies</HI> both pleasant and profitable.</P>
<P>Now a strict and diligent Enquiry in∣to all these several sorts of Learning, will fill up all the empty Spaces of your <HI>Time,</HI> which is commonly mis-imploy∣ed, if not vainly mis-spent, by all those Gentlemen that are not Scholars. You may alter the <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>Course</HI> of your <HI>Studies</HI> as you please, so that there
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>shall never be any spare Time upon your hands; nor will it ever seem to pass away slowly. But seeing the <HI>Hus∣banding of Time well,</HI> is a thing of the greatest advantage and importance to a <HI>Student;</HI> I shall give you an account of the <HI>Method</HI> which I have used, and found very successful in the Conduct of mine own <HI>Studies:</HI> Yet I would not have you to observe it so exactly, as to neglect the more seasonable <HI>Ad∣vice</HI> of others.</P>
<P>Now I have always thought, that 'tis the Duty and Interest of every Christi∣an to be well skill'd in the divine Arith∣metick of numbring his Days: For Time is a precious Jewel, for which we must all be accountable; and there∣fore he who loses a Day is dangerously prodigal; but those that dare mis-spend it, little less than desperate. For the prevention then of those Evils and Mis∣chiefs resulting from the fruitless ex∣pence of <HI>Time,</HI> I shall propound to you this following <HI>Method.</HI> And,</P>
<P>First, Rise early in the Morning, if your Health permit; for <HI>Aurora musis
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>amica,</HI> and the sooner the more early the Blessing. Let your <HI>first Thoughts</HI> be always with <HI>God;</HI> return him most humble and hearty <HI>Thanks</HI> for your Re∣freshment and Protection from the dan∣gers of the Night. Present the <HI>first Fruits</HI> of your Reason and other Facul∣ties to your <HI>Maker;</HI> think on him whilst you are dressing, and humbly beg that you may be clothed upon with the Robes of your Saviours Righteousness, and the most precious Ornaments of his Grace and Spirit.</P>
<P>Then return to your <HI>Closet,</HI> and pray earnestly, servently, constantly, devoutly and affectionately unto God, for your Preservation that day, and for ever, from Temptation. Sin and Danger; and that he would sanctifie your Person, and bless and prosper you in your <HI>Stu∣dies.</HI> 'Twas <HI>Luthers</HI> observation of himself, that <HI>bene or asse est bene studuisse;</HI> and if your Heart be early season'd with Gods Presence, 'twill relish of him all the day after. And when you have thus happily performed your <HI>Morning Devotions,</HI> then,</P>
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
<P>Secondly, Sit down a little and con∣sider (especially if you have occasion to go abroad or entertain Company that day at your Chamber,) what Tempta∣tions or Sins you are in danger to run upon; resolve against them, and see that your Purposes be fixt and steady: So that if any of those Temptations should afterwards assault you, call to mind what you have resolved on in your <HI>Closet,</HI> and then endeavour to arm your self against them with the Argu∣ments of your Religion; as the consi∣derations of <HI>Death, Judgment, Heaven</HI> and <HI>Hell.</HI> But if you expect nothing <HI>extraordinary</HI> that day, (intending to continue in the course of your <HI>Studies,</HI>) then a serious Recommendation of your Person and Assairs to God, in a general <HI>Petition,</HI> will be acceptable and suffi∣cient.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Begin your <HI>Studies</HI> with reading a <HI>Chapter</HI> or more of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> every <HI>morning,</HI> till you have read it all over; and then begin again; always observing the same <HI>Method.</HI> Meditate of, and consider well what
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>you read, that you may thence collect some useful <HI>Notes</HI> and <HI>Observations,</HI> for the Confirmation of your Faith, and Conduct of your Manners in the ways of Religion. And having read some Por∣tion of the Holy Scripture seriously and deliberately, (for the better under∣standing of it, you may consult Dr. <HI>Hammonds</HI> Paraphrase, or <HI>Grotius;</HI>) this, with your Prayers, will prepare you for your other <HI>Studies.</HI> Wherein,</P>
<P>Fourthly, Your <HI>Tutor</HI> will be care∣ful to give you the most proper and sea∣sonable <HI>Advice.</HI> Your <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> Lear∣ning will be chiefly (as I suppose) <HI>Lo∣gicks</HI> and <HI>Philosophy:</HI> Now if you'l but take pains to be an accurate <HI>Logician,</HI> and thorow-paced <HI>Philosopher,</HI> (which will not require very much time, if you be always careful to attend the Lectures and Disputations in the <HI>Schools</HI>) you'l readily understand any Author; and the whole course of all your future <HI>Studies,</HI> will not only thereby become beneficial, but pleasant and delightful.</P>
<P>Yet herein I desire to <HI>caution</HI> you, not to spend too much <HI>Time</HI> in dry and
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>useless <HI>Notions</HI> and <HI>Speculations,</HI> being a Fault which I have observed in the Methods of reading <HI>Philosophy</HI> in Fo∣reign <HI>Ʋniversities;</HI> for no <HI>Study</HI> is worth a Mans while that's not accom∣panied with Profit, and such unanswe∣rable Reasons and Arguments as are in a great measure able to silence all fu∣ture Debates, seeing the capacity of the Ignorant lyes as much below such <HI>Phi∣losophical Curiosities,</HI> as the more know∣ing and judicious are above them; so that there remains to all in things du∣bious and only probable, a Power to admit, or reject what Opinions they please. Therefore I would recommend <HI>Mathematicks</HI> next to <HI>Logicks,</HI> as the most useful part of <HI>Philosophy;</HI> for this <HI>Science</HI> proposes nothing but what's apparent by most undeniable <HI>Demon∣strations;</HI> which Knowledge is not on∣ly the chief we can acquire upon Earth, but will also accompany us to Heaven.</P>
<P>Fifthly, When you have leisure, read over your <HI>Classick Authors,</HI> and remark with your Pen what you find most ob∣servable in them; for as you'l hereby
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>understand the <HI>Customs</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> of the most antient and celebrated <HI>Hea∣thens;</HI> so this sort of Learning will qua∣lifie you to write and speak Latin well: And when you have obtained this <HI>Fa∣culty,</HI> you cannot be a stranger in any place where you come; nor can any thing be a greater Ornament to a Gen∣tleman and a Scholar.</P>
<P>Sixthly, And seeing your Quality and Estate will exempt you from all other Professions but that of a <HI>States-man,</HI> the Knowledge of all sorts of <HI>History</HI> will be very useful and necessary; but especially <HI>French Authors,</HI> being of all others the most accurate in <HI>Negotia∣tions</HI> and <HI>Memoirs,</HI> recorded by pub∣lick <HI>Ministers,</HI> and publisht by their <HI>Se∣cretaries</HI> after their Deaths: For 'tis observ'd by a Person of great Judgment and Policy, that none make more faith∣ful <HI>Reports</HI> of things done in all Nations than <HI>Ambassadours;</HI> having the best and most authentick Intelligence from their <HI>Princes Pensioners,</HI> who are obliged to acquaint them with all they can dis∣cover.</P>

<P>Seventhly, Consult likewise all the several <HI>Speeches, Declarations, Tryals</HI> and <HI>Transactions,</HI> occasion'd by the late unhappy <HI>Wars</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> wherein you'l find more natural and useful Know∣ledge, than is ordinarily to be met with in all the mouldy <HI>Records</HI> of antient <HI>Statists</HI> and <HI>Polititians.</HI></P>
<P>Eighthly, There will be no need to advise you what <HI>Authors</HI> you shall read in <HI>Divinity;</HI> for I know sufficient care is taken for that already; yet in my <HI>O∣pinion,</HI> next to the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> and our <HI>Churches Catechism,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hammonds Practical Catechism,</HI> and those Books by the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Whole Duty of Man,</HI> are the best. And indeed all our mo∣dern <HI>Writers</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> for the last fifty or sixty years, (who have imploy'd their Parts, Faculties and Time, in treating <HI>de omni ente,</HI> and out∣done the greatest part of the World,) if accurately read and well digested, will furnish you with variety of <HI>Matter,</HI> all sorts of <HI>Methods,</HI> and a delicate <HI>Style.</HI> But then you should take <HI>Advice</HI> in the choice of such <HI>Books,</HI> as are <HI>approved</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="14"/>and most <HI>authentick</HI> upon every <HI>Sub∣ject,</HI> that the whole Time of your <HI>Stu∣dy</HI> may be profitably imployed; for a <HI>few Books</HI> well read and throughly di∣gested, will more improve your Reason and Judgment, than hundreds superfici∣ally turned over, as many <HI>young Stu∣dents</HI> do.</P>
<P>Yet there's abundance of Pleasure in variety of Books; for when your Facul∣ties grow dull and weary of one, you may pass to another, as your own <HI>Ge∣nius</HI> and <HI>Inclination</HI> shall direct; where∣by the whole Time and Business of your <HI>Study</HI> will become a delight and bene∣fit, rather than a burthen to you: Nor can any <HI>Recreation</HI> be so pleasant, (this I find by experience,) nor any <HI>Labour</HI> so profitable to a <HI>Scholar</HI> as <HI>Study.</HI> And,</P>
<P>Lastly, You'l find it of singular use and advantage for the improvement of your <HI>Parts,</HI> to imploy and exercise your <HI>Pen</HI> upon every <HI>Occasion. Write</HI> often to your <HI>Relations</HI> and <HI>Friends;</HI> for the neglect of that is a general fault in <HI>young Students.</HI> Have always a <HI>Common-Place Book</HI> by you, (your <HI>Tutor</HI> will direct
<PB N="19" REF="14"/>you to the most useful <HI>Heads,</HI> and note therein the most remarkable, quaint, and ingenuous Passages you meet with in any <HI>Author,</HI> which you may afterwards have recourse to immediate∣ly upon every occasion: Observe like∣wise, and note in writing, all the Re∣markable <HI>Occurrences</HI> in your Travel; particularly the <HI>Situation</HI> of <HI>Places,</HI> the <HI>Customs</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> their <HI>Religion, Government, Policies, Traf∣fique,</HI> &amp;c. This will be of great ease to your <HI>Memory,</HI> and of singular use and advantage in the whole Progress of your Life; besides, you'l find that your <HI>Parts, Style</HI> and <HI>Method,</HI> will be the best im∣proved by much <HI>Writing:</HI> All Learn∣ed Men can witness this from their own Experience, and is very remarkable in all our <HI>English Worthies;</HI> insomuch that I dare be confident, if you'l apply your self to this method, your Reason and Judgment will by degrees attain to such a Habit, as will not dare to present you with any thing but what's very curious and excellent.</P>
<P>Yet I would not hereby engage you
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>to be so earnest in the pursuit of your <HI>Studies,</HI> as to prejudice your own <HI>Con∣stitution;</HI> for there's a Time for all things, and too much reading may prevent the Access of a newer, nearer, and quicker Invention of your own: Besides, if your Body be strong, as you'l rather complain of the shortness of the Day, than be wea∣ried with <HI>Study;</HI> so, if it be weak and feeble, the <HI>Decays</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> may be re∣paired, being also allowed to the strong∣est <HI>Constitutions,</HI>) either, First, By a sutable <HI>Conversation;</HI> or, Secondly, By moderate and innocent <HI>Recreations.</HI></P>
<P>For the first of these, namely a sutable <HI>Conversation:</HI> When you are wearied and indisposed with your <HI>Studies,</HI> a door of <HI>Conference</HI> is open, and the <HI>Conversation</HI> of learned, wise, and good Men, is a greater Refiner of the <HI>Spirit</HI> than <HI>Books.</HI> Yet let not this tempt you from your <HI>Studies</HI> in the Forenoon, which is the most proper Time to be reserved, and at your Book; however, whilst you conti∣nue in the <HI>Ʋniversity:</HI> And herein let me advise you to lay down such <HI>Rules</HI> to your self, in observing those stated
<PB N="21" REF="15"/><HI>Hours,</HI> as no Man shall be able to per∣suade you to recede from them; for that when your <HI>Resolutions</HI> are once known, as no Person of Ingenuity will disturb you, so you'l find this <HI>Method</HI> of keep∣ing this best part of the <HI>Day</HI> to your self,) will become not only practicable, but very commendable, and of singular benefit to you in more instances than I can readily mention.</P>
<P>But when <HI>Dinner</HI> is over, (so soon as you can with <HI>convenience</HI> and <HI>civility</HI> to the Company,) retire to your <HI>Closet,</HI> and pray (as in the <HI>Morning,</HI>) always concluding your <HI>Devotions</HI> in the Name of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and with the <HI>Lords Prayer:</HI> Again, <HI>read</HI> some por∣tion of the <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> in the <HI>Old Te∣stament,</HI> and the <HI>Psalms</HI> for the <HI>Day,</HI> and (as before) with attentive <HI>Observation.</HI> (And be as careful in performing your <HI>Evening Devotions,</HI> with <HI>Thanksgivings</HI> for the <HI>Blessings</HI> of the <HI>Day,</HI> and earnest Prayer for your <HI>Safety</HI> and <HI>Protection,</HI> that night and for ever). I do not doubt but you have good
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">As <HI>Common Prayer Book, Patrick</HI>'s <HI>De∣votions,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Helps</HI> and particular <HI>Devotions</HI> by
<PB N="22" REF="16"/>you for <HI>Morning</HI> and <HI>Evening,</HI> which you may use with your own, as God shall be pleas'd to enable you: But be sure that you never lie down to rest, till you have made your <HI>Evening Obla∣tion;</HI> that whether you sleep or wake, you may be always safe under the shel∣ter and protection of a gracious <HI>Provi∣dence.</HI></P>
<P>But to return, having performed your <HI>Devotions</HI> after <HI>Dinner,</HI> then you may either go to, or send for such <HI>Companions</HI> as you think fit, and see that they be al∣ways <HI>choice</HI> and <HI>few;</HI> for as the vitious and unlearned are not worthy of your <HI>Company</HI> and <HI>Acquaintance,</HI> so too many of the more learned, wiser, and better sort, will but increase the <HI>expence</HI> both of your <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Money;</HI> besides, the <HI>Examples</HI> of others do usually prevail more, and have a greater Influence than their <HI>Precepts</HI> and <HI>Counsels;</HI> and by the opportunities of <HI>Converse,</HI> either good or bad, we commonly imbibe all the Tinctures of <HI>Vice</HI> or <HI>Vertue;</HI> insomuch that 'tis almost impossible for the most prudent Man to hold out long against
<PB N="23" REF="16"/>the forcible Batteries of Custom and Opportunity. But,</P>
<P>There are no certain <HI>Rules</HI> to be pre∣scribed for <HI>Converse;</HI> seeing all Discour∣ses of that <HI>Kind</HI> are <HI>Occasional,</HI> and de∣pend much upon the <HI>Circumstances</HI> of <HI>Time, Place, Persons,</HI> &amp;c. yet a Gentle∣man has usually the freedom to be as inquisitive as he pleases; and what would be censured in others as humorous <HI>Mo∣roseness,</HI> or pragmatical <HI>Sawciness,</HI> will be interpreted in you, as an ingenuous desire and thirst after Knowledge: Therefore 'tis a singular and extraor∣dinary Priviledge you have in this Kind above Persons of a lower Rank, which (being improved to the best Advanta∣ges,) may very much conduce to your Interest and Satisfaction; for he's a ve∣ry weak Companion from whom you may not receive some benefit, and re∣turn <HI>wiser.</HI> But then if you <HI>correspond</HI> with Learned Men and Communicative, they'l freely impart to you those <HI>Secrets</HI> (in a little time,) which have cost them, and would have put you to the expence of much Pains and Travel; and if the
<PB N="24" REF="17"/><HI>Company</HI> be below you in Parts and Learning in being free, open, and dis∣cursive of what you know, and the oft∣ner you repeat them they'l be more ri∣veted and confirmed to you, and impress them upon your Mind and Memory, in more durable and indeleble Characters.</P>
<P>Yet give me leave to <HI>caution</HI> you in two things: And First, See that you be innocently free and chearful in your <HI>Conversation:</HI> Let <HI>hoc age</HI> be your con∣stant <HI>Motto;</HI> for if a Man be sullen, mo∣rose, mopish, and unseasonably poring upon his Book or Business, he loses the Fruits and Benefits of <HI>Converse,</HI> nor will his <HI>Company</HI> be looked upon by others to be either <HI>profitable</HI> or <HI>diversive.</HI> And Secondly, Avoid the other Extreme of <HI>talking too much,</HI> as troublesome and ab∣surd; for every Man that can be a fit Companion for you, will expect to have a share in the <HI>Discourse.</HI> It must needs then be a great Vanity in many Gentle∣men, who having some little smatte∣rings of Learning, (for empty Vessels have the loudest Sound,) do make all Places eccho with their <HI>Latin, Italian,
<PB N="25" REF="17"/>French,</HI> &amp;c. and Citations out of the most celebrated Authors; for the more that any Man seems to borrow from Books, he do's thereby proclaim the meanness of his own natural Parts, which only and properly can be call'd his own.</P>
<P>Be reserved in passing your Judg∣ment, especially in what may concern the Reputations or Interests of other Men; your Business will be rather to enquire (as before,) and that too with all possible Candor and Modesty, into the Policies and Forms of Government, all sorts of Learning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore to this End endeavour to be acquainted, and <HI>converse</HI> with Men of the greatest Parts Sobriety and Experience; from whom you'l always receive Benefit, and note something worthy your Observa∣tion. I would not advise you to avoid wholly the Conversation of your <HI>Coun∣try-men,</HI> yet correspond as little with them as possible; for you would find it very unprofitable upon several ac∣counts, which I leave to your own Consideration.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="18"/>
<P>Thus every thing is beautiful in its Season: And we have seen hitherto how the chief part of your Time should be imployed at your <HI>Book, Lectures,</HI> and <HI>Exercises</HI> in the <HI>Schools,</HI> and <HI>Conversa∣tion</HI> with others, whilst you continue in the <HI>Ʋniversity,</HI> or when setled in any other Place: (For upon <HI>Travel,</HI>) the Methods must be altered and order'd ac∣cording to the Laws and Dictates of Prudence and Discretion. And tho neither <HI>Birth,</HI> nor <HI>Quality,</HI> nor <HI>Estate,</HI> can give any Man a Priviledge or Pa∣tent to be idle: Yet,</P>
<P>Secondly, There must be some con∣venient Time set apart (which should always be in the <HI>Afternoon,</HI>) for seaso∣nable and innocent <HI>Refreshments;</HI> the Diversion and Reparation of your wea∣ry <HI>Thoughts,</HI> as well as the Ease and Sup∣port of your <HI>Body.</HI> But herein I must <HI>caution</HI> you, that your <HI>Recreations</HI> be <HI>moderate,</HI> endeavouring always to con∣fine your self to these following <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Measures.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore your bodily <HI>Pleasures</HI> should not be <HI>expensive</HI> of too much
<PB N="27" REF="18"/><HI>Time,</HI> nor <HI>Money;</HI> both which may be very well imployed to better Purposes; nor <HI>cruel,</HI> nor <HI>bloody,</HI> nor <HI>sinful;</HI> as when <HI>Pastimes</HI> and <HI>Sports</HI> are mixed with <HI>Anger, Passion, Violence, Fury, Cur∣sing, Swearing, Quarrelling, Covetousness,</HI> and the like: For we should use our <HI>Di∣version</HI> and <HI>Merriments,</HI> as we do <HI>Saw∣ces</HI> to our <HI>Meats,</HI> to <HI>delight</HI> and <HI>refresh</HI> Us, that we may hereby become more active and vigorous when we return to our necessary <HI>Business</HI> and <HI>Studies;</HI> which cannot by any means serve those good and necessary <HI>Ends,</HI> unless they be always conducted with Reason and Sobriety.</P>
<P>Hitherto of those <HI>Arguments</HI> and <HI>Mo∣tives, Rules</HI> and <HI>Methods,</HI> which I hope may be of some use, not only to allure and invite, (tho most agreeable to your own temper, and therefore more at∣tractive,) but direct you too in the suc∣cessful Management of your <HI>Studies.</HI> We pass on now to the <HI>Second Head,</HI> which will more immediately respect your <HI>Manners and Deportment,</HI> as they dispose to <HI>Religion.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVICE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN Of an Honourable FAMILY Now in His TRAVELS Beyond the SEA'S, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> PART II. <HI>Of Manners and Deportment.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE tender Care of your Worthy <HI>Parents</HI> in your vertuous and re∣ligious, as well as learned Education, and
<PB N="30" REF="20"/>your own <HI>natural Genius</HI> and <HI>Temper</HI> might spare me the trouble of writing a large <HI>Essay</HI> of <HI>Morality</HI> and <HI>Civil De∣portment:</HI> Yet because Wickedness and Vice is always more insinuative than Vertue and Goodness, which by several repeated Acts grows (gradually) to a custom, and becomes habitual; and be∣cause Persons in your <HI>Station</HI> are usually exposed to more and greater <HI>Temptations</HI> than those who move in a lower <HI>Orbe:</HI> Therefore without any further Apology, you'l be pleas'd to indulge me the li∣berty and freedom to become your Re∣membrancer, or rather <HI>Monitor</HI> in a few <HI>Things.</HI> And,</P>
<P>First, It will be a great Argument of Parts and Discretion, to be modest and reserved in <HI>speaking of your Self, Family,</HI> and <HI>Affairs,</HI> lest by a sanciful and over∣weaning Conceit of your own <HI>Quality</HI> and <HI>Merits,</HI> you deservedly incur the the Censure of <HI>Pragmaticalness</HI> and <HI>Ostentation;</HI> from which <HI>Precipice</HI> many have dangerously fallen: For we know that <HI>Pride</HI> was the Sin of the <HI>fallen An∣gels</HI> and Foundress of Hell, the ruine
<PB N="31" REF="20"/>of Mankind from the beginning of the <HI>Creation,</HI> and ever since hateful in it self, and abominable to God and all good Men: But besides the Evil, such is the Folly and Vanity of this <HI>Vice,</HI> that tho the humorous and self-conceited Man has seldom any thing to boast of, yet he's usually so transported with an Opi∣nion and tow'ring Ambition of what he has, as to neglect a Supply of what is wanting; and being always attended with <HI>Insolence</HI> and <HI>Contempt</HI> of others, do's effectually blast and disparage all other Vertues: For every Man is more inquisitive after the <HI>Blemishes</HI> than <HI>Beau∣ties</HI> of a proud Person; whereas the humble and modest Man may pass silent∣ly and uncensured, with more real Faults and Indiscretions.</P>
<P>Therefore have always a lowly and modest Opinion of your own <HI>Person, Quality, Acquisitions, Merits</HI> and <HI>Endow∣ments,</HI> both of <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Mind;</HI> and be content that others should have so too: For why should any Man admire those little Pittances of Learning, Know∣ledge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> seeing they are not properly
<PB N="32" REF="21"/>our own, but are either begg'd or bor∣row'd from others, or have been pur∣chased and acquired by dear-bought Ex∣perience? Besides if we seriously re∣flect upon and consider all the Desicien∣ces, Follies and Indiscretions of our best Performances, the Ignorance and Errors of our Judgments, the Perverseness and Obstinacy of our Wills, the many Sins and Infirmities we are daily guilty of, and that every thing we have may be taken away or blasted in a moment: Such Considerations as these, would humble the <HI>proudest Man</HI> alive, and sub∣due all the vain and insolent Conceits of our haughty and ambitious Spirits; for such proud and supercilious Humours are more sutable to the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> where Men seem wifer than they are, than this of <HI>England,</HI> where our <HI>Pa∣triots</HI> are usually wiser than at first sight they seem to be. Therefore as you are obliged to subdue and abandon all a∣spiring and lofty <HI>Conceits</HI> of what you are, or what you have, so the <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Humility</HI> will recom∣mend you to the Acceptance, and pro∣cure
<PB N="33" REF="21"/>you a good Esteem and Opinion from all you converse with.</P>
<P>Secondly, Be <HI>prudently</HI> reserved in censuring or ridiculing the Faults and Indiscretions of other Men: For, a <HI>pru∣dent Carriage</HI> is highly esteemed by all, but strangers especially. Besides, <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Discretion</HI> will teach and direct you how to subjugate all the Ap∣petites, Passions, Affections and Incli∣nations both of Soul and Body, to the Empire of Reason and sound Judgment; so that when you have reduced all your lower Faculties to this Order and Har∣mony, your <HI>Ʋnderstanding</HI> will direct aright, and your <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Affections</HI> be∣come conformable to the Laws and Rules of right Reason and Religion. Then, you'l manage all your Affairs <HI>pru∣dently,</HI> with the greatest Calmness and Tranquillity, and be always in the pur∣suit of generous Ends, and the most ef∣fectual Means and Methods of obtaining them. And thus,</P>
<P>Thirdly, By acting according to these <HI>Rules</HI> of <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Discretion,</HI> you'l come by degrees to an excellent Tem∣per
<PB N="34" REF="22"/>and Habit of <HI>Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Mode∣ration:</HI> For you'l hereby prevail with your self, not to indulge your <HI>Appetite,</HI> to the disturbance and disquiet of your rational Powers: Nor will any Man of Prudence and Sobriety endeavour to please and gratifie his <HI>Palate</HI> with deli∣cate <HI>Meats</HI> and <HI>Drinks,</HI> nor his <HI>Touch</HI> with <HI>Softness</HI> and <HI>Effeminacy,</HI> nor his <HI>Eye</HI> with fair and gaudy <HI>Show's,</HI> nor his <HI>Smell</HI> with costly <HI>Perfumes:</HI> For an im∣moderate <HI>Complyance</HI> with all or any of these, would not only force your <HI>Reason</HI> to quit her Dominion and Authority, and thereby hurry you into all manner of sin and wickedness, but continually distract your Thoughts, with a fruitless variety of Expectations and Disappoint∣ments. The ready way then to be at peace with God, and Man, and your own Conscience, will be to govern your self according to the sober <HI>Dictates</HI> of <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Moderation,</HI> as Gods <HI>Ho∣ly Word</HI> and the <HI>Dictates</HI> of <HI>right Reason</HI> shall direct you.</P>
<P>Now, these <HI>Vertues</HI> and their oppo∣site <HI>Vices</HI> having the most considerable
<PB N="35" REF="22"/>Aspect upon <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> as the greatest Examples either of Good or Evil; I shall therefore be more particular in the hand∣ling of this Point of <HI>Sobriety:</HI> And for the prevention of a Shipwrack of your Interest and Honour, (many thousands having split their <HI>Vessels</HI> upon this Rock,) give me leave to advise you in the</P>
<P>First place, To be very <HI>sober and tem∣perate</HI> in <HI>Eating.</HI> Have recourse always to the foregoing Rules of <HI>Prudence,</HI> and they'l teach you to consult the Health &amp; Preservation of the Body, that so it may be the fitter Mansion for your Soul: For 'tis always observable, that ungovern'd Lusts are the inseparable Companions of intemperate <HI>Eating,</HI> and all other Sins are indulg'd and encourag'd by this Kind of <HI>Excess;</HI> whereas on the contrary, those that live <HI>temperately</HI> and accor∣ding to Rule, are seldom tempted, or troubled, as the intemperate are, with sickly and ill Humours, or deprived of the comforts and benefits of Health by raging and violent Distempers: For as a good Conscience is the best Divinity,
<PB N="36" REF="23"/>so Temperance is the best Physick, and a good Expedient thro' Gods Blessing, to preserve <HI>mentem sanam in Corpore sano.</HI> And therefore if thro' inadvertency you should transgress at any one <HI>Meal,</HI> let no Temptation allure you to a second <HI>Repast,</HI> till by a fierce Hunger and Fast∣ing, you find your self discharg'd of the former <HI>Excess:</HI> By which means, your Understanding will be always clear, and your Constitution firm and unshaken; especially if you take care,</P>
<P>Secondly, To use the like <HI>moderation</HI> in <HI>Drinking,</HI> for your Health and Re∣freshment, both as to the <HI>Quality</HI> and <HI>Quantity</HI> of <HI>Liquors.</HI> Your <HI>Prudence</HI> will observe, that this is one of the reign∣ing and epidemical Sins of the Nation, and an <HI>Inlet</HI> to most other Sins, which many thousands (and those generally none of the meanest Rank,) make their chief Trade and Business; and is of late Years become so modish and fashiona∣ble in all Entertainments, that the many will scarce think themselves welcome, unless the Liquor and Freedom be al∣lowed them to make Beasts of them∣selves:
<PB N="37" REF="23"/>One would think that their Quality and Education should reach 'em better Manners. But alas! they'l go further yet, and the most which is yet a higher Aggravation of their Sin and Villany,) become the Devils Factors for Damnation; and use the most base and sordid Methods, not only to debauch themselves, but knock down others. But for the prevention of all <HI>Excess</HI> in this Kind, be pleased to consider,</P>
<P>That <HI>intemperate Drinking</HI> is the in∣centive to, and fewel of all filthy Lusts: For Chambering and Wantonness is the usual Effect of Rioting and Drukenness, as the most <HI>Debauchees</HI> find and feel by woful experience. This puts Men up∣on desperate Projects, and engages 'em in all sorts of Wickedness and Villany; insomuch, that the very most in their drunken Fits, will blaspheme, swear, curse, lie, backbite and rail against their innocent Neighbours, and do often kill and destroy one another: For some of 'em are cut off by sudden <HI>Accidents,</HI> o∣thers in <HI>Duels,</HI> occasion'd thro' <HI>Drink∣ing;</HI> and not a few of those <HI>guzling He∣ctors</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="24"/>have summ'd up their Days at the end of a <HI>Watchmans</HI> Bill. In a word, <HI>intemperate Drinking</HI> lays a sure Foun∣dation for all sorts of lingring Diseases, makes the most not only Beasts, but Mad-men, and either brings them (as I have noted to you,) to a swift, untime∣ly, and cruel <HI>Death,</HI> or a detestable and infamous <HI>Old Age,</HI> (which not one in a thousand ever attains to,) and those that do, are offensive to all honest and vertuous Company, and to God the most of all: And besides these tempo∣ral Punishments, see their eternal <HI>Doom</HI> is detain'd already, if they live and die in this Sin unrepented of, and unre∣form'd. <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.11, 12. <HI>Luke</HI> 21.34. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.21. Whereunto might be added many other parallel Passages to the same pur∣pose.</P>
<P>These Considerations well weighed, might persuade any Man to be master of his <HI>Appetite,</HI> and keep himself within the due bounds of <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Mo∣deration;</HI> which would not only be an extraordinary Blessing to private Persons and Families, but conduce very much
<PB N="39" REF="24"/>to the Interest of the <HI>Publick:</HI> For I am confident, there's more Money spent in one year in excessive <HI>Drinking,</HI> than would very well provide for and main∣tain all the truly poor and indigent People in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore as you tender the Welfare of your Person and Family, and Interest of your Soul and Body, in this and a su∣ture Life, avoid and abandon the Con∣versation and Company of all dissolute, debauched and intemperate Persons: Let not their Allurements, nor Scoffings, nor Railings, persuade you to a compli∣ance with them in their inhumane and beastly <HI>Immoralities,</HI> so as to <HI>run with them to the same Excess of Riot,</HI> 1 Pet. 4.4. For, they are the Devils Instru∣ments, whom he commonly imploys, to precipitate inconsiderate Youth from the Throne of Vertue: Besides, 'tis a most infectious and bewitching <HI>Vice,</HI> insomuch, that if a Man should once fall in love with, and contract a Habit of <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> 'twill be very difficult to shake it off; for the longer it possesseth him, the more he will delight in it; and
<PB N="40" REF="25"/>the older he grows, the more beastly and sottish: Upon which account ma∣ny have complain'd at the last Hour, that this single Sin has been the cause of all their other Wickednesses, which they must eternally smart for.</P>
<P>I know the best of Men may some∣times exceed the Boundaries of <HI>Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Temperance</HI> in <HI>Drinking:</HI> Now (Sir,) if ever it should be your Unhap∣piness to be overtaken with this Fault, whose Consequences are so mischievous, (which I beseech you beware of;) do not remove from the place where you received it, except in such a place or company where the Danger may en∣crease by your continuance therein; for hereby some part of the Inconveni∣ence may be avoided, and more of the Shame and Scandal, always attending this giddy Spirit; which working in the Pate, will make one act all the Hu∣mours habitual in a Mad-man. When you have obtain'd a Habit of <HI>Tempe∣rance,</HI> in the moderate use of <HI>Meats</HI> and <HI>Drinks,</HI> which are the proper Effects and Fruits of <HI>Prudence,</HI> these Vertues will dispose you:</P>
<PB N="41" REF="25"/>
<P>Thirdly, For the well-governing of the other Lusts and Appetites of the <HI>Flesh,</HI> in your Abstinence from <HI>bodily Pleasures.</HI> Now (Sir) you are under the most forcible Obligations by the Laws of Nature and Christianity, to a∣void and abstain from all <HI>carnal Pollu∣tions,</HI> and every kind and degree of <HI>Ef∣feminacy:</HI> For unless you keep under your Appetite (as <HI>Prudence</HI> directs,) 'twill presently set on fire the whole Course of Nature, and plunge both Soul and Body into most desperate, damna∣ble, and irreparable Mischiefs.</P>
<P>For this kind of sinful <HI>Excess</HI> and <HI>Ex∣travagance,</HI> seldom or never fails to draw Men away from God and his Wor∣ship; which is observable in that deplo∣rable Instance of young King <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 11.12. who tells us from his own sad Experience, (which might be a sufficient Caution to all young Men,) that when they are once plung'd into those <HI>Pits</HI> of <HI>Filthiness,</HI> 'tis very difficult to retreat. See <HI>Prov.</HI> 7.22, 23. and <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.27. implying in both Passages, the great Perils and Dangers intempe∣rate
<PB N="42" REF="26"/>rate Persons run upon, who will pro∣stitute their Wit, Learning, Honour. E∣states, and endanger their Souls, Bodies, and All, rather than not gratifie their brutish and unsatiable Lusts. This is not only the case of this great Man be∣fore us; for we have seen many sad and miserable Spectacles even in our own Age of the decayed Bodies, shatter'd E∣states, and ruin'd Families, of many (otherwise hopeful) Young Gentlemen. And tho perhaps here and there one may escape the woful Effects of this Lewdness and Debauchery, for the pre∣sent,) yet without repentance and a∣mendment of Life, Gods Judgments and Vengeance will certainly overtake them in another World: For <HI>Whoremongers</HI> and <HI>Adulterers</HI> God will judge; and whosoever dies under the reigning Pow∣er and Prevalence of this Sin, shall ne∣ver enter into the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Therefore for God's sake and your own, and as you tender the <HI>Weal</HI> of your <HI>Family,</HI> hold no <HI>Parley</HI> with your Ap∣petite in this Case; for if you do com∣ply in the least, you are in great danger
<PB N="43" REF="26"/>of being over-come. Set a strict <HI>Guard</HI> then upon all your <HI>Senses,</HI> watch all the <HI>Ports</HI> and <HI>Avenues</HI> of your <HI>Soul</HI> against the incursion of carnal Temptations, and have God always in your thoughts: This was young <HI>Josephs</HI> security against the lustful Temptations of his wanton and importunate <HI>Mistriss;</HI> so that by this means, if any evil Motions should creep in unawares, you'l not suffer them to fix there; but either cast them out, or kill them.</P>
<P>Use strict <HI>Temperance</HI> (as we have persuaded before,) with Fasting and Labour; all which are powerful <HI>Expe∣dients</HI> to subjugate the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and the best <HI>Instruments</HI> to further you in the great work and necessary business of <HI>Mortification</HI> and <HI>Self-denial.</HI> And here∣unto add your most earnest Prayers un∣to God for the assistance of his Grace, that you may obtain a comfortable Vi∣ctory over your Appetites and Passions; which is a Duty so absolutely necessary, that unless it be constantly and regular∣ly perform'd, all your other Natural and Moral Indeavours will prove ineffe∣ctual
<PB N="44" REF="27"/>and to no purpose. And thus your Christian <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Moderation</HI> in all these several <HI>Instances,</HI> will further qualifie you,</P>
<P>Fourthly, For the exercise and im∣provement of those other excellent Ver∣tues of <HI>Meekness</HI> and <HI>Patience,</HI> which you'l find of admirable use and advan∣tage for the quiet and peaceable govern∣ment of your whole Life; so that your <HI>Conversation</HI> will become not only plea∣sant, but delightful both to your self and others. Now these <HI>Vertues</HI> do eminent∣ly consist, in bearing and suffering <HI>meek∣ly</HI> and <HI>patiently</HI> all the cross Accidents (which you'l often meet with,) without fainting and fretting, and such an even∣ness and composedness of Mind, as is only consonant to the Mild and Gentle, yet magnanimous Temper and Spirit of <HI>Christianity;</HI> and if all be thus well within, no Troubles nor Afflictions can vex nor discompose you from without. Besides, when by the Assistance of God's Grace you are form'd into this admira∣ble Frame and Temper of Mind and Spi∣rit, you'l neither be timorous in <HI>Dan∣ger,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="27"/>envious in <HI>Want,</HI> impatient under <HI>Afflictions,</HI> angry or restless at <HI>Reproaches</HI> and <HI>Contempt,</HI> nor malicious and re∣vengeful under <HI>Injuries</HI> and <HI>Affronts;</HI> but bear every cross Event with equa∣nimity and a chearful submission to the Will of God, in all Straits and Difficul∣ties whatsoever. And this is certainly the greatect Victory in the World, (and far beyond all the Conquests and At∣chievements we ever read of,) for a Gentleman to be master of his own <HI>Passions.</HI></P>
<P>Hence therefore 'twill evidently ap∣pear, how much those Persons are to blame, who think it a piece of Honour in case of <HI>Injuries</HI> and <HI>Affronts,</HI> to make the <HI>Sword</HI> Umpire of their own Life and others. And tho many great <HI>Fa∣milies</HI> have paid dear for this <HI>Honour</HI> or <HI>Valour,</HI> (as they are pleased to call it,) yet I do not find it warranted either by <HI>Prudence</HI> or <HI>Religion,</HI> (as a worthy Gen∣tleman observes;) nor will any Man that is either wise or pious, either give or accept a <HI>Challenge:</HI> For no <HI>Quarrel</HI> can be screwed up to that pitch of Indis∣cretion,
<PB N="46" REF="28"/>but one or both Parties must be arraigned as guilty of the most stupen∣dious Folly and Madness in the World. Besides, <HI>formal Duels</HI> are but a late In∣vention of the Devil, and never heard of in former Times, as relating to private <HI>Injuries</HI> and <HI>Affronts;</HI> and 'tis most cer∣tain, that sending of <HI>Challenges</HI> renders the Dead a greater Murderer than he that kills him, as being the immediate Author of his own Death: Nor are these inhumane and unchristian <HI>Practices</HI> so genteilly treated by our <HI>English Laws,</HI> that any Man should be encouraged in this desperate <HI>Attempt:</HI> For if the Mur∣derers Legs, or his Friends procure not his Pardon or Reprieve, (tho he should not die in the Encounter, yet) he runs precipitantly upon his own Death, and his Estate shall be confiscated too, to the perpetual detriment and undoing of his <HI>Family.</HI> Besides the <HI>Sting</HI> of <HI>Conscience,</HI> (if he has any Conscience at all,) and a dreadful <HI>Fear</HI> like that of <HI>Cains,</HI> atten∣ding Blood, will render the whole re∣mainder of his Life tedious and misera∣ble to such unfortunate Men; who will
<PB N="47" REF="28"/>ever after smell too strong of <HI>Blood,</HI> to be admitted into any intimate Friend∣ship or Relation.</P>
<P>Therefore in this Case particularly, <HI>Meekness</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> are not only a Christian Vertue, but the truest Cou∣rage and surest Defensative against all <HI>Injuries</HI> and <HI>Affronts:</HI> And as the pra∣ctice of these <HI>Vertues</HI> may probably qua∣lifie the <HI>Heats</HI> and <HI>Passions</HI> of any quar∣relsom and dissolute <HI>Company</HI> you shall happen to engage in, (tho take all pos∣sible care to avoid such <HI>Furies,</HI>) so this excellent Frame and Temper of Mind and Spirit, will dispose you for a brighter Crown when these <HI>Storms</HI> are blown over. Again, The exercise and im∣provement of this <HI>Christian Prudence</HI> and <HI>Moderation, Meekness</HI> and <HI>Patience,</HI> will further direct and enable you,</P>
<P>Fifthly, To be moderate in using, and a good Husband in the management of that Patrimony and Estate, which <HI>Gods Providence</HI> and the <HI>Discretion</HI> of your <HI>Parents</HI> have allotted you. Now 'tis observable, that Riches and Honours do expose Men to the greatest <HI>Tempta∣tions;</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="29"/>(and tho your present Circum∣stances do not require much Enlarge∣ment upon this Head,) yet give me leave to remark to you, That 'tis a great fault and weakness in many <HI>Young Gentlemen,</HI> who cannot see the <HI>Pomps</HI> and <HI>Vanities</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> but they must needs fall in love with them. These seeming Beauties may and will tempt you (if possible,) to <HI>Lewdness</HI> and <HI>Luxury;</HI> but 'tis your own fault if you be insnared and led captive by them: Nor shall you ever find any thing in those vain <HI>Foole∣ries,</HI> which will be able to satisfie or please your rational Desires and Expe∣ctations.</P>
<P>Yet I shall readily grant you, that he whom God has blessed with a plentiful Estate, has many great Opportunities to do good both to himself and others; (for your direction herein, see the <HI>Gen∣tleman's Calling</HI>): Nor can any Man of Reason and Piety (tho he be rich and honourable,) come under the Tempta∣tions of being either Idle or Extravagant: For righteous <HI>Noah</HI> did in reality see two Worlds (before and after the De∣luge,)
<PB N="49" REF="29"/>and yet was not polluted with the Vices or Vanities of either; vertu∣ous <HI>Lot</HI> was holy and chast in the midst of <HI>Sodom;</HI> and <HI>Moses</HI> in <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s House kept close to the God of <HI>Israel;</HI> so did <HI>Elisha</HI> in the <HI>Syrian</HI> Court, and <HI>Daniel</HI> and others among the <HI>Persians,</HI> &amp;c. Your Danger or Safety then, must slow from a Principle within you: For tho the Devil and the World may and will tempt, yet they have no power to con∣strain you: Nor can any thing ever make a Man unhappy, but a voluntary compliance with those Temptations, and the base suggestions of his own sla∣vish Appetite. Be prudent and mode∣rate therefore in disposing of your <HI>Mo∣ney</HI> (both now and always); for if you spend <HI>too high,</HI> you'l incur the Censure of <HI>Prodigality</HI> or <HI>Epicurism;</HI> and if <HI>too low,</HI> either of unbecoming <HI>Niggardliness,</HI> or fordid <HI>Covetousness:</HI> Which (as an ingenious Person observes,) is like a Candle ill made, and smothers the splen∣dour of a happy Fortune in its own Grease.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="30"/>
<P>Sixthly, Be moderate also in your <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Apparel;</HI> let it not be youth∣fully wanton, but grave and comely, like the Mind and Behaviour of the Wearer. But do not by any means ex∣ceed in the Humour of Bravery: For our <HI>Clothes</HI> should rather humble, than puff us up, being always the visible <HI>En∣signs</HI> of our Sin and Slavery; nor shall any Man be esteemed for this <HI>sort of Ex∣travagance,</HI> but by Fools and Wantons.</P>
<P>Seventhly, I shall but add one <HI>Consi∣deration</HI> more, and that will be of gene∣ral use and necessary importance, in the prudent, moderate, patient, peaceable and christian Conduct of your whole life; which will render your Conversa∣tion pleasant and profitable to your self, and acceptable to all vertuous and good Men. And this will be the dis∣creet and conscientious Management of all your <HI>Thoughts, Words</HI> and <HI>Actions.</HI> And,</P>
<P>First, For the government of your <HI>Thoughts.</HI> Now (Sir,) if you be care∣ful and reserved, so as not (willingly) to conceive or foster an evil <HI>Thought,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="30"/>you'l then be afraid to <HI>speak,</HI> or <HI>act</HI> a∣ny thing contrary to your own Reason and Conscience. And to this End <HI>think</HI> often (as before) of the <HI>quatuor Novis∣sima,</HI> Death and Judgment, Heaven and Hell; which thro the assistance of God's Grace, may keep all the sinful Excursi∣ons of your Thoughts under so much restraint, as you'l not readily and wil∣lingly conceive any thing that shall be either sinful or irregular. And this will be an excellent Disposition.</P>
<P>Secondly, For the Government of the <HI>Tongue,</HI> which should be always kept under a strict guard: For <HI>Solomon</HI> says, That Life and Death are in the power of it. And <HI>Euripides</HI> truly affirms, That every licentious and unbridled <HI>Tongue</HI> shall in the end find it self unfortunate: For we see by daily experience, that all <HI>Quarrels, Mischief, Hatred,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Destruction,</HI> ariseth from unadvised <HI>Speech;</HI> and in much <HI>Talking</HI> there are many Errours, from which your Enemies will take the most dangerous Advantage. Besides, all scurrilous, fro∣thy, profane, idle, uncharitable, filthy,
<PB N="52" REF="31"/>and wanton <HI>Communication,</HI> is not on∣ly sinful and impertinent, but altogether unbecoming a Gentleman; whose Ex∣ample is usually a Pattern to others, and for whose sins they must be accounta∣ble (if they be Patterns of wickedness) as well as their own.</P>
<P>Set a watch then always before the doors of your Lips, that no vain <HI>Commu∣nication</HI> proceed out of your Mouth; and pray earnestly unto God, that he would so sanctifie your Speech, that Truth, Integrity and Innocence, may be the Rule and Standard of all your <HI>Discourse.</HI> And as it will be very happy for you if you observe these Rules, so 'twill be as necessary to avoid the <HI>Con∣versation</HI> of those whose <HI>Tongues</HI> are profane and licentious. Do not by any means listen to, nor give the least En∣couragement to <HI>Whisperers, Tale-bear∣ers,</HI> and <HI>inquisitive Persons,</HI> who busie themselves with the Affairs of other Men, that creep into Houses as <HI>Spies,</HI> to hear and learn <HI>News,</HI> which con∣cerns them not: For I have always observed them to be base and unwor∣thy;
<PB N="53" REF="31"/>few of them thrive and prosper, nor shall they ever be respected amongst worthy and wise Men. But,</P>
<P>Thirdly, Be circumspect and prudent in the Management of all your <HI>Actions.</HI> Set your self against all Sins in general, and every one in particular, but especi∣ally, against those whereunto your Tem∣per and Disposition are the most incli∣ned; for these will require the greatest Diligence and Endeavour to overcome and subdue them. Do not indulge your self in any one Lust, neither commit the least sin with delight and approba∣tion; because, even those which we think are the smallest, will prove De∣coy's and Incentives to greater; vain and sinful <HI>Thoughts</HI> proceeding to <HI>Words,</HI> and <HI>Words</HI> to <HI>Deeds:</HI> So that in this <HI>Pro∣gress</HI> of <HI>Wickedness,</HI> a Man knows not where to stop, till he has plunged him∣self into the most dangerous and irre∣parable <HI>Mischiefs.</HI></P>
<P>And then on the other hand, for your <HI>Positive Duties;</HI> you should always pro∣pose God's Glory, the happiness of your self and others, as the <HI>End,</HI> and his in∣fallible
<PB N="54" REF="32"/>Word and the Dictates of sober Reason, as the Rule and Standard to go∣vern all your Affairs by: For without this, your best <HI>Endeavours</HI> will prove either unprofitable or sinful. Whereas, if you observe this <HI>Method,</HI> and your <HI>Intentions</HI> be <HI>sincere,</HI> tho you fail in many Instances of Duty, and unwilling∣ly fall into some <HI>Sins</HI> and <HI>Errors,</HI> yet God will be gracious in not imputing them, and pass Judgment upon you ac∣cording to the general Frame and Ten∣dency of your Life, if you do not wil∣fully and wickedly <HI>continue</HI> in any <HI>known Sin,</HI> or the <HI>neglect</HI> of any <HI>known Duty.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis observable hence, what Obliga∣tions you lie under, to avoid the most accursed and tempting Company of profane <HI>Swearers,</HI> gluttonous <HI>Persons, Wine-Bibbers,</HI> unchast <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Wo∣men,</HI> &amp;c. I have singled out those <HI>Vi∣ces</HI> (on purpose) which are most inci∣dent to <HI>Youth,</HI> and given you the most seasonable <HI>Advice</HI> I can think of, to vanquish and overcome them. Reject therefore every Temptation to sin and wickedness in the first Assault, and the
<PB N="55" REF="32"/>Conquest will be easie and certain. La∣ment and deplore your past Failings, and humbly beg the assistance of God's Grace and Spirit, that you may be more watch∣ful over your self and ways for the fu∣ture. Now the best and most certain Means to avoid <HI>greater Sins,</HI> is to make Conscience of the <HI>less:</HI> (For the <HI>least Sin</HI> is damnable in the sight of God); and when the work of Regeneration is wrought in you, beware of Relapsing; consider the dangers of habitual Sin and Apostasie from Grace, and exert all your Endeavours to live in the exercise of a Conscience void of offence both towards God and Man: For so the whole Time of your short aboad in this World, will be pleasant and comfortable, and your Death happy.</P>
<P>There are some other little things I desire to note to you before I leave this <HI>Point.</HI> And,</P>
<P>First, Beware of <HI>Swimming,</HI> which you'l probably be allured to in those <HI>Low Countries,</HI> the most being dexte∣rous in that Art: For tho it may save a Mans Life in case of necessity, yet a
<PB N="56" REF="33"/>vain Currosity herein may expose you to the greatest Dangers and Hazards. Therefore if you should attempt it for your Pleasure, exceed not your own Depth; and in seeking to save another, have a care you drown not your <HI>self.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Your <HI>Gesture and Deport∣ment</HI> should neither be light, nor inso∣lent, nor wanton: For the Life and Soul of true Honour, is in generous Qualities, and a modest and affable <HI>Carriage;</HI> but yet with a comely re∣gard to your self, and such as becomes a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> whose Mind is furnished with worthy and generous Spirits. But in this <HI>Point</HI> (as in his abstinence from the <HI>Vices,</HI> and practice of all the <HI>Vertues</HI> hitherto recommended,) you have an admirable Pattern in your dear and worthy <HI>Father,</HI> almost beyond Exam∣ple; whose temper and sweetness of Disposition has deservedly recommen∣ded him to the Favour, and made him honourable and respected amongst all Persons of all Ranks and Conditions. Yet be careful to avoid the other <HI>Ex∣treme</HI> of affected <HI>Easiness</HI> or <HI>Compliance,</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="33"/>lest your good Disposition should be im∣posed upon by others <HI>Deceit,</HI> and your own too much <HI>Credulity:</HI> For too much <HI>Familiarity</HI> and <HI>Fawning</HI> is always re∣warded either with <HI>Flattery</HI> or <HI>Con∣tempt.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, What concerns your <HI>Bodily Deportment, Wrestling, Fencing,</HI> and other Feats of <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Military Skill;</HI> and how far all or any of these are expe∣dient or necessary to be understood or practised, I must leave to your self, and better Judgments, for Advice and Di∣rection; for these are not my <HI>Pro∣vince.</HI></P>
<P>What other <HI>Vertues</HI> or <HI>Vices</HI> may occur in your Conversation with o∣thers, (which my designed Brevity and the Occasion I write upon, have persua∣ded me to omit,) you should note and observe them, and make that use of them, at least to improve and correct your own: For what you dislike or admire in others, study and endeavour to avoid the Evil, and strive to imitate what is vertuous and commendable. And when you have seriously consider'd
<PB N="58" REF="34"/>all those several <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Arguments,</HI> which under this <HI>Head</HI> do concern your <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Deportment;</HI> you'l be pleas'd to go one step farther to the last Branch of this faithful and friendly <HI>Ad∣vice,</HI> which will have a more peculiar Respect to your <HI>Religion.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVICE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN Of an Honourable FAMILY Now in His TRAVELS Beyond the SEA'S, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> PART III. <HI>Of RELIGION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Business of <HI>Religion</HI> is the grand Concernment that all of us are sent into the World to mind;
<PB N="60" REF="35"/>and our eternal <HI>Happiness</HI> or <HI>Misery</HI> de∣pends on the right <HI>knowing</HI> and <HI>ac∣knowledging</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>mistakes</HI> about it. We had need therefore be very ac∣curate in the choice of that <HI>Religion</HI> we intend to live and die in, and venture our eternal Salvation upon.</P>
<P>Now, there are many <HI>Opinions</HI> in the World concerning <HI>Religion;</HI> and we may be easily imposed on and delu∣ded, if we make not a prudent and wise <HI>Choice.</HI> I shall not trouble you with an account of <HI>Heathenism, Mahometa∣nism,</HI> and <HI>Judaism:</HI> For these are all <HI>false Religions,</HI> and contrary to the whole <HI>scope</HI> and <HI>design</HI> of the <HI>Gospel;</HI> which being without the Lines of Christian Communication, we leave 'em to themselves and the righteous Judgment of God. We <HI>Christians</HI> know no other way to Salvation but <HI>One,</HI> and that's by <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Christ Jesus;</HI> and there∣fore we think our selves obliged to be∣lieve the <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Christianity</HI> with all our Hearts, and <HI>live</HI> according to them: For there's no other name un∣der Heaven whereby we can expect or
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>hope for Salvation, but the Name of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> Acts 4.12.</P>
<P>Yet there are many <HI>Differences,</HI> not only <HI>Circumstantial</HI> but <HI>Fundamental,</HI> even amongst those that are called <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> which disturb the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> and ruine the <HI>Souls</HI> of many private <HI>Persons,</HI> as will appear more ful∣ly afterwards. But 'tis more immedi∣ately my Design to recommend to you, and inforce the <HI>Belief</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of the truly Primitive and Reformed <HI>Re∣ligion,</HI> as now solemnly and publickly profess'd, and by <HI>Law</HI> establish'd in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I have not the least cause to doubt or suspect, but that your <HI>Parents</HI> did se∣riously weigh and consider (when they sent you abroad,) the <HI>Minority</HI> of your <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Judgment;</HI> which (yet) with∣out your own extraordinary care and caution, may hurry you unawares into the peril of <HI>Miscarriage.</HI> For alas! how many young <HI>Gentlemen</HI> have lost their Hopes and themselves in <HI>Foreign Ad∣ventures,</HI> and return'd home as empty of Grace and other vertuous Accomplish∣ments,
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>as full of Words, Vanity, and other vitious Habits and Inclinations? Now (Sir,) if you should unhappily <HI>Miscarry,</HI> which the Lord of his great Mercy prevent; as it would be the greatest <HI>mischief</HI> to your <HI>self;</HI> so not only your <HI>Parents</HI> hopes of your <HI>Youth,</HI> but the Staff and Comfort of their <HI>Age</HI> will lie a bleeding, to their unexpressi∣ble <HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>Sorrow.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Considerations</HI> have very much affected me, which I took the freedom to mention to some of your Friends, when I first heard of their Design of sending you beyond <HI>Sea;</HI> and upon more due and serious deliberation, do now with more considence (yet hum∣bly) communicate my Thoughts to you upon these <HI>Subjects:</HI> For I am very well assured, (that considering me as a <HI>Di∣vine</HI> and <HI>True Friend,</HI>) I shall not incur the least <HI>suspicion</HI> of being (herein) too bold or presumptuous; and will think my self sufficiently apaid, if thro God's Blessing, I may be an happy Instrument in doing the least good to your <HI>Soul.</HI> I know it would be the greatest Happi∣ness
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>to your <HI>self,</HI> as well as a Comfort to all your <HI>Friends,</HI> if you be persuaded by any <HI>means</HI> to fall in love with <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> betimes, and <HI>remember your Cre∣ator in the Days of your Youth,</HI> Eccles. 12.1. This has been for many Ages the glory and support of your Family, which has been always eminent for Re∣ligion and Loyalty; nor could there ever be less Danger of a degenerous Heir, (not to slatter you Sir, nor puff you up,) nor greater Hopes of its esta∣blishment to future Generations.</P>
<P>But before we come to the Point, give me leave to note to you (for your greater Security,) That you'l be in danger of meeting with many <HI>Brokers</HI> of <HI>Villany,</HI> whose Trade and Business it is to pervert, and do live upon the Spoils and Ruins of <HI>Young Gentlemen;</HI> insomuch that scarce any Person of your Quality can travel into <HI>Foreign Parts,</HI> but he shall be mightily caress'd, and treated with so much respect and civility, as if it were a pleasure to be <HI>seduced.</HI> We know very well what <HI>Stratagems</HI> are used by some Men, to
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>undermine the sacred <HI>Foundations</HI> of the <HI>Doctrin</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> insomuch that (before his <HI>Ma∣jesties Declaration of Indulgence</HI>) neither <HI>Laws</HI> nor <HI>Penalties</HI> could restrain them. What then will they not dare to attempt within their own Territories and Juris∣dictions, especially when they meet with Persons of Temper and Quality, who are inclin'd and dispos'd (as you are) to <HI>Religion?</HI> And seeing also they have not only free scope and priviledge, but encouragement to seduce; so, that 'tis next to impossible not to be assaulted (at least) by their close and cunning In∣sinuations.</P>
<P>There have been, alass! too many perverted already; the loss of whom joyned with the Churches, we have sufficient cause to lament: And indeed 'tis a great wonder we have lost no more, (and let us praise God for it,) con∣sidering the importunate <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>Plausibleness</HI> of our <HI>Adversaries,</HI> on the right hand and on the left; who like those infected with the <HI>Plague,</HI> have always an itching desire of tainting
<PB N="65" REF="37"/>others. Wherefore none can blame the Clergy of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> if we be as zealous for Truth, as our Adversa∣ries of Falshood; which Argument a∣lone might be a sufficient <HI>Apology</HI> for this Undertaking.</P>
<P>I have read (Sir) of some <HI>Countries</HI> (I wish your Curiosity may not carry you thither) whose chief Vertues (mo∣destly speaking,) do very much border either on Impiety or Superstition; and yet those very Places (as <HI>Travellers</HI> ob∣serve,) which are most worth seeing, are of all others the most contagious. Now 'tis no small difficulty for a Young Gentleman to be chast and vertuous in the midst of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and few have tra∣vell'd thither, however they may please themselves with variety of <HI>Objects,</HI> and returned home without some dangerous Tincture, either of Sin and Wickedness, or Schism and Sedition.</P>
<P>Thus I have noted in general, what <HI>Temptations</HI> and <HI>Hazards</HI> you are ex∣posed to amongst <HI>Foreigners;</HI> and the greatest of all is, the danger of being corrupted and contaminated in your
<PB N="66" REF="38"/><HI>Religion and Manners:</HI> And 'tis certain, tho your <HI>Tutors</HI> be never so careful, yet much must be left to your own Temper and Inclination, how to sever Good from Evil: For there's no Man proves Facti∣ous, Superstitious, or extreamly Wicked on a sudden, but thro several Declinati∣ons, falls by degrees from Vertue and Religion. Seeing then so many Tem∣ptations and Snares may await you in e∣very Place where you come, (which no Mans Prudence can foresee,) and your own Heart prove deceitful and forward to betray you: Therefore I beseech you, be constantly upon your Guard; and if your <HI>Tutors</HI> should either be negligent or persidious, (as many have been in the like Trust, and I could name some of them,) yet thro the Assistance of God's Grace, you may secure your <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> and <HI>Conscience</HI> inviolable.</P>
<P>But for the further prevention of their <HI>Machinations,</HI> who lie in wait to deceive, and your Establishment and Confirmati∣on in the Religion of the <HI>Church of Eng∣land,</HI> I offer these Three following <HI>Par∣ticulars</HI> to your serious and impartial <HI>Consideration.</HI> And,</P>

<P>First, I shall give you a true (tho short) Account of the Constitution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> both as to her Doctrin and Worship, or Discipline; which I hope may for ever oblige you to continue in her <HI>Communion.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, We shall enquire a little into the Principles and Practices of the <HI>Romish Church</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> wherein they chiefly differ from <HI>Ʋs:</HI> A Religi∣on of all others (within the Pail of the Christian Church,) the most pleasing and delightful to Flesh and Blood: A Religion which no Man scarce can com∣ply with; especially if he has been bred up in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but must offer violence to his own Reason and Conscience, if he pretends to either.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We shall consider the <HI>Pre∣tensions, Reasons</HI> and <HI>Arguments,</HI> which our Brethren of the <HI>Non-conformity</HI> have urged in their own Defence, to palliate their <HI>Separation</HI> from our <HI>Communion,</HI> and seduce others: By all which, I hope 'twill evidently appear, that there can∣not be the least colour of Reason, nor any thing like Argument to tempt, much
<PB N="68" REF="39"/>less to persuade you, or any other Per∣son of Parts and Education, (who is not blinded with Passion, Interest or Preju∣dice,) to separate from the most truly Orthodox, and best constituted Church in the whole World; I mean the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Of all these severally. And,</P>
<P>First, Of the <HI>Religion</HI> of our <HI>Church,</HI> both as to its <HI>Doctrin</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> or <HI>Discipline.</HI> And First, Concerning her <HI>Doctrin:</HI> Wherein 'tis most plain and evident, That we have a clear Professi∣on of all <HI>Fundamental Truths</HI> and <HI>Du∣ties,</HI> both to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> in our <HI>Creeds, Commandments, Lords Prayer,</HI> and the Doctrin of the <HI>Two Sacraments;</HI> which every Orthodox and Believing Christi∣an in the whole World, will readily sub∣scribe, and say <HI>Amen</HI> to.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Sabbaths</HI> are duly observed and kept, with the greatest Reverence and Solemnity. God's <HI>Holy Word</HI> is pure∣ly and faithfully preach'd; his <HI>Sacra∣ments</HI> duly administred, according to our Blessed Saviours own Institution. We worship <HI>God,</HI> viz. the <HI>One Divine Essence,</HI> and <HI>Trinity</HI> of <HI>Persons,</HI> in Spirit
<PB N="69" REF="39"/>and Truth; in and thro' Christ, with∣out the Mediation of Saints and Angels. We hope for, and believe the <HI>Remission</HI> of <HI>Sins,</HI> and <HI>Salvation</HI> of our <HI>Souls</HI> and <HI>Bodies,</HI> by the Merits of <HI>Christ</HI> alone, thro' the Mercies of <HI>God,</HI> and upon the condition of a sincere and unseigned <HI>Re∣pentance:</HI> Which <HI>Repentance</HI> in the Judgment of our <HI>Church,</HI> implies a true <HI>Sight</HI> and <HI>Confession</HI> of, hearty <HI>arrow</HI> for, and the <HI>hatred</HI> and <HI>forsaking</HI> of all our former <HI>Sins;</HI> with a stedfast <HI>Resolu∣tion</HI> never to return to them again, with any <HI>consent, delight</HI> or <HI>approbation,</HI> and the use of all possible <HI>Endeavours</HI> to put these <HI>Resolutions</HI> in practice, even to our Lives End: So, that if we shall at a∣ny time fall into the commission of the least <HI>Sin,</HI> or the neglect of any <HI>Duty,</HI> either wilfully, or by infirmity and sur∣prize; we do again seriously and so∣lemnly renew our <HI>Repentance,</HI> and are never at peace with our Selves and in our Consciences, till we be again re∣conciled unto God, or our Neighbour, whom we have offended. And this we do as well after as before our Conver∣sion;
<PB N="70" REF="40"/>not daring to continue in any <HI>one sin unrepented of, unreformed.</HI></P>
<P>When we have thus renounced and a∣bandon'd <HI>Sin,</HI> the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>Devil,</HI> as our deadly <HI>Enemies,</HI> we think our selves further oblig'd to magnifie and adorn our <HI>Profession,</HI> by the <HI>Works</HI> and <HI>Fruits</HI> of <HI>Piety</HI> and true <HI>Holiness, Ju∣stice</HI> and <HI>Charity, Purity</HI> and <HI>Sobriety,</HI> Tit. 2.12. and to perform all and eve∣ry one of these <HI>Duties</HI> both to God and Man, without <HI>Partiality,</HI> without <HI>Hy∣pocrisie.</HI> This is a short <HI>Specimen</HI> of the <HI>Doctrin</HI> and <HI>Fundamentals</HI> of our <HI>Reli∣gion,</HI> which in all and every <HI>particular</HI> are warranted and recommended to Us by God's infallible <HI>Word,</HI> and the con∣current Suffrages and Confessions of all the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> in the <HI>Primitive</HI> and <HI>Purest Ages</HI> of the <HI>Gospel.</HI> And as the <HI>Doctrin</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> is Sound and Orthodox, so,</P>
<P>Secondly, Our <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>Discipline</HI> is truly <HI>Antient</HI> and <HI>Apostolical:</HI> For there's not one single Passage in our <HI>Li∣turgy</HI> and <HI>Church Service,</HI> and <HI>Circum∣stantials</HI> of <HI>Worship</HI> (our most rigid <HI>Ad∣versaries</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="40"/>being Judges,) that is either <HI>Anti-Scriptural</HI> or <HI>Sinful,</HI> but do all ve∣ry much conduce to <HI>Decency, Order, Ʋni∣formity,</HI> and the <HI>Edification</HI> of its <HI>Mem∣bers:</HI> All which, I could easily make appear to you by an Induction of Par∣ticulars; insomuch that there's not one <HI>National Church</HI> under the Cope of Hea∣ven, that's more Orthodox than Ours, in Her whole <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>Politie.</HI> Con∣sult and examine our <HI>Liturgy, Articles, Homilies, Canons</HI> and <HI>Constitutions, Cere∣monies,</HI> &amp;c. and there you'l find a truly <HI>Primitive</HI> and <HI>Apostolical Spirit</HI> in the disposition of the several <HI>Parts,</HI> for the Honour and Glory of <HI>God,</HI> and Advance∣ment of his true <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI> a∣mongst <HI>Ʋs.</HI></P>
<P>And for a further Testimony hereof, and your own particular Satisfaction, read (when you can have the conveni∣ence of those Books, and leisure to read 'em,) <HI>Hookers Ecclesiastical Politie,</HI> Dr. <HI>Comber</HI>'s large Volume on our <HI>Church Liturgy,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Falkner</HI>'s <HI>Libertas Ec∣clesiastica;</HI> which <HI>Triumvirate</HI> are suf∣ficiently able to answer all the <HI>Doubts</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="41"/>and <HI>Scruples</HI> of any unbiast and unpre∣judiced <HI>Reader.</HI> Besides, I can give you a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of such <HI>Books,</HI> when you please to command it, as have treated so learnedly, judiciously and convin∣cingly of the <HI>Religion of the Church of England,</HI> in all the Points of <HI>Faith, Worship</HI> and <HI>Discipline,</HI> as will furnish you with such Reasons and Arguments, as neither <HI>Papist</HI> nor <HI>Phanatick</HI> were e∣ver yet able to answer.</P>
<P>Let your <HI>Religion</HI> then, and that <HI>Church</HI> into which you were admitted and initiated by <HI>Baptism,</HI> and in whose <HI>Communion</HI> you have been hitherto edu∣cated, be as dear to you as your <HI>Estate</HI> and <HI>Life.</HI> Remit nothing of your Love and Affection, Zeal and Courage, to de∣fend it, when you are thereunto law∣fully called: For the <HI>Doctrin</HI> and <HI>Wor∣ship</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> has been transmit∣ted to Us by our pious <HI>Ancestors,</HI> with all the <HI>Sanctions</HI> both of <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>hu∣mane Authority;</HI> and as sure as there is a God, the <HI>Religion</HI> which you profess came down from <HI>Heaven:</HI> For the ever∣lasting <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> has consign'd and
<PB N="73" REF="41"/>confirm'd it to Us, by the Effusion of his own precious <HI>Blood,</HI> and the Suffrage of many <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Martyrs</HI> in this Kingdom; so that you have not the least reason to scruple your <HI>Compliance</HI> with, and <HI>Conformity</HI> to it.</P>
<P>If therefore an <HI>Angel,</HI> or <HI>Devil,</HI> or a∣ny ill <HI>Men,</HI> should at any time suggest the contrary to you, have no <HI>Communi∣cation</HI> with him, but reject him as an utter Enemy and Impostor. And when you have more leisure, opportunity and experience, your <HI>Curiosity</HI> may lead you to read over and consider the <HI>Canons</HI> and <HI>Constitutions</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin Churches;</HI> wherein you'l find the true <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Things</HI> and <HI>Times,</HI> the <HI>Begin∣nings, Proceedings, Increases, Encounters, Yieldings,</HI> and <HI>Restaurations</HI> of the <HI>Gos∣pel;</HI> and what the <HI>Primitive Fathers</HI> did and suffer'd for the propagation of the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> and the interest of the <HI>Church:</HI> And herein you'l also see the <HI>Conformity</HI> of our <HI>Church of Eng∣land Men,</HI> since the beginning of the <HI>Re∣formation,</HI> to the <HI>Primitive Pattern.</HI> And when you have thus made some
<PB N="74" REF="42"/>considerable <HI>Progress</HI> in inquiring into the <HI>Fundamentals</HI> and <HI>Superstructures</HI> of our <HI>Religion,</HI> you'l be better able to judge of the <HI>Opinions</HI> and <HI>Errors</HI> of those that differ from Us. But till you have more time and convenience to in∣form your <HI>self</HI> as to the Particulars, I shall present you,</P>
<P>Secondly, With a true and brief Ac∣count of <HI>Popery,</HI> or the <HI>Doctrin</HI> and <HI>Practices</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> as to those <HI>Particulars</HI> wherein they differ from the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England:</HI> For which cause, we are forced to <HI>separate</HI> from them, since we cannot communicate with them without sin; nor have we departed further from 'em, than they have departed from Themselves, and the Truth.</P>
<P>Now for Method's sake, we shall con∣sider also, First, The <HI>Principles</HI> or <HI>Do∣ctrin;</HI> And, Secondly, The <HI>Practices</HI> of the <HI>pretended Catholicks</HI> of the <HI>Romish Church:</HI> Whereby 'twill evidently ap∣pear, that <HI>Popery</HI> (if rightly understood,) is no such beautiful and charming Ob∣ject, as to allure any Man of <HI>Reason</HI> and
<PB N="75" REF="42"/><HI>Conscience</HI> to fall in love with it. And,</P>
<P>First, For the <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Popery;</HI> and we are obliged to call them so, be∣cause they are so esteem'd and account∣ed by their own <HI>Church:</HI> For since their <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent,</HI> no Man can properly be admitted into the <HI>Romish Communion</HI> (however in <HI>Popish Countries</HI>) but shall be censured and condemned as a damn'd <HI>Heretick,</HI> unless he believes as follow∣eth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">That a Mortal Man, as the <HI>Pope</HI> in <HI>Cathedra,</HI> (or as some say, with his <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Cardinals</HI>) is infallible, knows all things, and can err in nothing; that he directs, informs, animates, and com∣mands both in <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Purgatory;</HI> expounds <HI>Scripture,</HI> forgives <HI>Sins,</HI> ca∣nonizeth <HI>Saints,</HI> creates new <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Faith;</HI> and in all these, (and many other of the same Stamp and Chara∣cter) is as absolute and infallible as his <HI>Maker.</HI></Q> [But they are not yet agreed amongst themselves where to fix this Infallible Judgment, whether in the <HI>Pope</HI> alone, or <HI>Council,</HI> or the <HI>Pope</HI> and his <HI>Council;</HI> and therefore their <HI>Church</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="43"/>and <HI>Pope,</HI> for any thing they have yet prov'd or determin'd, are erroneous and fallible in the first Principle of their <HI>New Creed,</HI> and monstrous Doctrin of <HI>Infallibility.</HI>]</P>

<P>Not to trouble you with Citations at large, there are several other known and received Doctrins of their Church, which bear the same <HI>Impression</HI> and <HI>Cha∣racter;</HI> but those I have mention'd al∣ready being the most considerable, the rest will either stand or fall by 'em. Yet their Doctrin of <HI>Oral Tradition</HI> (which I had almost omitted,) deserves its place amongst the rest: For this vilifies the Holy Scripture, destroys its Authority
<PB N="82" REF="46"/>and Sufficiency, by a certain Dependance upon the Church; whereby they make our Saviour's <HI>Prophetical Office</HI> a meer <HI>Nullity,</HI> in saying no less, than that He has not sufficiently reveal'd the <HI>Will</HI> of <HI>God</HI> to the <HI>Sons</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> but all the World must be beholden to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> for their <HI>Oral Tradition.</HI> In a word, all their Pardons, Confessions, Indulgen∣ces, Satisfactions, Merits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do ex∣presly contradict the great End and De∣sign of our Saviours <HI>Incarnation,</HI> and set up the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> in his stead.</P>
<P>These are the <HI>New Articles</HI> of <HI>Pope∣ry,</HI> which (as incredible and absurd as they are) the Subjects of that Com∣munion are bound to believe, under the pain and peril of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Anathema.</HI> And indeed, they are all <HI>New,</HI> (you may see the Original of 'em in Dr. <HI>Com∣ber</HI>'s <HI>Advice</HI> to the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI>) and wholly unknown to the Old Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in her Primitive and Gospel Purity: For these Errors and Delusions seem to have been contrived on purpose, for the Support and Main∣tenance of the Pride and Covetousness
<PB N="83" REF="46"/>of the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> and his <HI>Clergy,</HI> as well as the Advancement of the <HI>State∣liness</HI> and <HI>Grandeur</HI> of their <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>I could easily make it appear to you in all the <HI>Particulars,</HI> that there's not one of these <HI>Articles</HI> that has any Foun∣dation in Scripture or Primitive Anti∣quity, but are contrary to both, and do undermine and overthrow almost all the <HI>Articles</HI> of our Christian Faith. But what I have said already concerning these <HI>Doctrins,</HI> may be a sufficient <HI>cau∣tion</HI> to you not to venture your eternal Salvation upon such a Bottom, lest you communicate with them in their Plagues, <HI>Rev.</HI> 18.4. I have taken some pains to digest the whole <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Po∣pish Controversie</HI> into Order and Method, for the satisfaction of my Self and Friends, (which I thought of necessary use at this time.) There are other ex∣cellent Authors which may be more va∣luable, but you may command this if you please; 'tis not very large, yet <HI>Me∣thodical.</HI> But to return: As the <HI>Doct∣rin</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> (in those Instances wherein they differ
<PB N="84" REF="47"/>from Us) are heterodox, absurd and erroneous; so,</P>
<P>Secondly, Their <HI>Practices</HI> are the na∣tural and genuin Results and Consequen∣ces of such <HI>Principles.</HI> Not to mention their private and personal <HI>Immoralities,</HI> which may consist well enough with that <HI>Religion,</HI> especially considering the <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Indulgence</HI> allowed them, (which do more professedly belong to those of that Communion than any o∣ther,) we shall consider their <HI>Practices</HI> as <HI>Popish,</HI> which are warranted to them by the <HI>Examples</HI> and <HI>Sanctions</HI> of their <HI>Superiours.</HI> And of this Rank are,</P>
<P>Their Worshiping of <HI>Images, Relicks, Crosses, Angels, Saints,</HI> and particularly the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> all which are a most direct Violation of the <HI>Second Com∣mandment;</HI> and therefore they leave it out of all their <HI>Catechisms, Manuals, Mass-Books,</HI> &amp;c. lest it should rise up in Judgment against them; which <HI>Prac∣tices</HI> are also contrary to the whole <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Doctrin</HI> both of the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Testaments.</HI></P>
<PB N="85" REF="47"/>
<P>Such also are their Dealings with the <HI>Laity,</HI> who rob them of the <HI>Bread of Life,</HI> in denying them the reading of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> the <HI>Cup</HI> in the <HI>Sa∣crament,</HI> and in commanding the whole <HI>Worship</HI> of <HI>God</HI> to be celebrated and perform'd in an unknown <HI>Tongue;</HI> which few of their <HI>Laity,</HI> and perhaps some of their <HI>Priests</HI> do not understand. Tho they cannot but know that our blessed Saviour has expresly commanded, that <HI>all</HI> (indefinitely) both <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Peo∣ple,</HI> should <HI>search the Scriptures, drink of that holy Cup,</HI> and <HI>pray with the Spi∣rit,</HI> and <HI>pray with the Ʋnderstanding al∣so:</HI> Which no Person can in their Com∣munion, unless he understands <HI>Latin</HI> well, and the strange <HI>Mumblings</HI> of their <HI>Priests;</HI> who being generally too igno∣rant themselves, are afraid that the Peo∣ple should know it. <HI>O horrendum Nefas!</HI> that such <HI>Practices</HI> as these should be so much as tolerated by those that are call'd Christians. And yet there are still others as bad, or worse than the for∣mer, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Spiritual Tyranny,</HI> in exacting
<PB N="86" REF="48"/>a blind <HI>Obedience</HI> in <HI>Matters</HI> of <HI>Faith;</HI> their innumerable <HI>Ceremonies</HI> and <HI>Super∣stitions,</HI> which almost swallow up the whole Substance of <HI>Religion;</HI> their no∣torious <HI>Schism</HI> (many degrees worse than that of the <HI>Donatists</HI> and <HI>Novati∣ans,</HI>) in <HI>separating</HI> from all other <HI>Churches,</HI> far more Pure and Orthodox than themselves; and yet, because they cannot be the <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Subjects,</HI> therefore they shall be none of <HI>Christs.</HI></P>
<P>To say nothing of their <HI>School Points</HI> and <HI>Casuistical Divinity,</HI> 'tis evident that their whole <HI>Religion</HI> is only the bare shadow and outsides of <HI>Christia∣nity,</HI> and meer <HI>Pageantry</HI> and <HI>Forma∣lity</HI> of <HI>Devotion:</HI> For alass! their poor simple and ignorant <HI>Laity,</HI> say, hear, and do they know not what, and re∣turn from their Churches as void of Instruction, and Christian Admonition and Edification, as when they went; and yet for all this, (which is the high∣est aggravation of their Sin and Misery,) they are obliged to believe, that this their blind <HI>Devotion</HI> is not only <HI>accep∣table</HI> but <HI>meritorious.</HI> Besides, how ma∣ny
<PB N="87" REF="48"/>notorious and damnable <HI>Sins</HI> pass for <HI>Venial,</HI> and how easily are they atton'd for? Insomuch that a few <HI>Drops</HI> of <HI>Holy Water,</HI> and <HI>Cross</HI> upon their <HI>Breasts</HI> or <HI>Foreheads,</HI> will throughly wash off the <HI>Stain,</HI> (according to their groundless Apprehensions,) and expiate the guilt of all their heinous and cry∣ing <HI>Sins.</HI> Their notorious <HI>Equivoca∣tions</HI> have scarce left any room for Truth, whereby they deceive others, and offer violence to their own Con∣sciences. But tho poor ignorant and unwary Souls may be imposed upon and deluded, yet it cannot be so with an All-seeing God; who will one day convince all Men, and expose their So∣phistical <HI>Villanies</HI> and <HI>Reservations</HI> to the open and publick view both of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Angels.</HI></P>
<P>Now this Liberty and Indulgence of theirs is so pleasing and acceptable to sensual and carnal <HI>Men,</HI> that 'tis no great wonder that they gain so many Proselytes to their Party, as some do presumptuously and vainly boast. But then if we give our selves the trouble
<PB N="88" REF="49"/>to enquire what sort of Persons they are whom they have perverted; we shall find, that many of 'em are silly Women and Men notoriously debauch∣ed, or ignorant, or of mercenary Spirits, who expect <HI>Preferment</HI> in that Way. And therefore we have no great cause to regret the loss of them; and if our number be less, yet we are not the worse: For if all our Licentious <HI>Hypo∣crites</HI> and <HI>Malefactors,</HI> who are not worthy to live in the World, should go over to their Communion, we shall have no great cause to complain.</P>
<P>But alas! these erroneous <HI>Principles</HI> and worse <HI>Practices</HI> of the <HI>Papists,</HI> who being the more intelligent and judici∣ous sort of that Communion, cannot be so much the error and mistake of their Judgments, as the perverseness of their Wills: And tho a simple and ig∣norant <HI>Popeling,</HI> who lies under such Temptations and Obligations, (as be∣fore,) may be saved; yet I am afraid, the more Learned and Discreet having made Shipwrack of Faith and a good Conscience, are in a very dangerous
<PB N="89" REF="49"/>State, if they live and die according to those corrupt Principles; because they are in the number of those dam∣nable <HI>Heresies</HI> the <HI>Scripture</HI> speaks of.</P>
<P>What I have already offer'd, are <HI>Truths</HI> as clear as the Sun; nor can a∣ny thing in the World be more <HI>de∣monstrative</HI> to a <HI>Person</HI> throughly ac∣quainted with the <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Pra∣ctices</HI> of <HI>Popery.</HI> And yet for all this, 'tis a thousand to one you'l meet with some bold and cunning <HI>Sophisters,</HI> who'l tell you a great many plausible <HI>Stories,</HI> and endeavour to elude the most clear and convincing <HI>Reasons,</HI> which can be urg'd against them; whereby they do strangely impose upon, and many times entrap poor ignorant and unwary <HI>Souls.</HI> To instance in some <HI>Particulars:</HI> And,</P>
<P>First, A <HI>Catholick</HI> (say they,) so li∣ving and dying, even by the Confessi∣on of the <HI>Protestants</HI> themselves, may be saved. [Which is a confessed Argu∣ment of our <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Moderation.</HI>]</P>
<P>Secondly, That the <HI>One Church</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> is more likely to be found in all
<PB N="90" REF="50"/><HI>World,</HI> than in a <HI>Corner.</HI> [As if there were no true Church in the World, but theirs.]</P>
<P>Thirdly, In all Ages than of later Years. [Not considering that we had a Christian Church in <HI>England,</HI> before ever <HI>Popery</HI> was known in the World.]</P>
<P>Fourthly, That this <HI>One Church</HI> is ra∣ther to be found in <HI>Ʋnity,</HI> than in <HI>Di∣vision.</HI> [Which we could easily recri∣minate and retort upon themselves: For there are more and greater <HI>Schisms</HI> and <HI>Divisions</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> than in any other <HI>Christian Church</HI> what∣soever.]</P>
<P>Fifthly, That they have a <HI>Succession</HI> of <HI>Bishops, Priests</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> from the Days of the <HI>Apostles</HI> downward. [So have we, as is fully evident from all our Antient and Authentick <HI>Records.</HI> See Bishop <HI>Bamhal</HI>'s Account of the <HI>Schism</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> And they have quite forgotten that there were three <HI>Popes,</HI> or <HI>Bishops</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> at the same time: What then became of their uninterrupted Succession?</P>
<PB N="91" REF="50"/>
<P>Sixthly, That the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> is the <HI>Supreme Head</HI> of the <HI>Church Ʋni∣versal,</HI> and <HI>Christs Vicar</HI> in extraordi∣nary upon <HI>Earth.</HI> [Which spurious <HI>Title</HI> and <HI>Ʋsurpation,</HI> (as we noted be∣fore,) is rejected by at least two parts of the <HI>Catholick Church</HI> at this day, and disliked by some <HI>National Churches</HI> (as 'tis supposed) of their own Communi∣on; who are inclinable enough (if they knew but how) to cast off that Papal and Tyrannical Yoke.]</P>
<P>Seventhly, That the <HI>Church of Eng∣land</HI> is only a Branch lopt off, or a Rag torn from the <HI>Coat,</HI> and that we had no <HI>Church</HI> nor <HI>Religion</HI> before <HI>Luther.</HI> [This is a most gross and manifest <HI>Ʋn∣truth:</HI> For we had a <HI>Christian Church</HI> in <HI>England</HI> before ever St. <HI>Peter</HI> came at <HI>Rome,</HI> founded by <HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Arima∣thea,</HI> and flourished under King <HI>Lucius,</HI> the first <HI>Christian Monarch</HI> in the World. And we know very well by what <HI>Ʋsur∣pations</HI> and <HI>Encroachments,</HI> and the time when <HI>Popery</HI> first got footing in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> that <HI>Augustin</HI> the <HI>Monk,</HI> caused some hundreds of that Order to be slain
<PB N="92" REF="51"/>at <HI>Bangor,</HI> to make way for it: And 'tis further evident by what Means and Me∣thods the <HI>Bishops</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> did work up∣on the Weaknesses and Credulity of some, and the Necessities of others of our <HI>Christian Princes,</HI> not having the Power, or Courage, or Resolution, to cast off the <HI>Popes Supremacy,</HI> till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, King of <HI>England:</HI> A Person whose <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Affairs</HI> (let our <HI>Adversaries</HI> bespatter him as they please,) made him a fit <HI>In∣strument</HI> to begin the <HI>Reformation;</HI> which thro' God's <HI>Providence,</HI> and the prudent and religious Conduct of his <HI>Successors,</HI> has been happily carried on and perfected; which we hope thro' the Favour and Protection of his Sa∣cred Majesty who now Reigns, may be continued a Blessing to <HI>Ʋs</HI> and our <HI>Posterity.</HI>]</P>
<P>Hence therefore 'twill appear to you, That these are all thred-bare and stale <HI>Evasions</HI> and <HI>Subtersuges,</HI> to colour and palliate their groundless and unreasona∣ble Pretences to <HI>Antiquity, Visibility, Ʋnity, Magnificence,</HI> Right of <HI>Succession</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="51"/>of, and in their Church: All which have been answered at least an hundred times, by Worthy and Learned <HI>Authors,</HI> as you'l see afterwards. But this <HI>Controver∣sie</HI> has been so well stated and through∣ly canvassed by our <HI>Church of England Men</HI> in these last three Years, that there will be more difficulty now than ever, to persuade any Gentleman of Sense and Ingenuity to believe their incongruous and hateful Absurdities.</P>
<P>But yet there are some others of the same Foot-mark, who having laid aside all Modesty and Candour, their Fore∣heads are so steel'd with Confidence, as to affirm, That we have neither <HI>Church, Priests, Sacraments,</HI> nor <HI>Religi∣on</HI> amongst <HI>Ʋs;</HI> and are so uncharitable as to load <HI>Ʋs</HI> with all the nonsensical and unjust Calumnies imaginable, not regarding what they are, so they be but spiteful and malicious; observing the old Maxim, <HI>Fortiter calumniari aliquid haerebit.</HI> Nay, they'l even disclaim their own <HI>Popish Doctrins</HI> and <HI>Practices,</HI> as the <HI>Invocation of Saints, Worshiping of Ima∣ges,</HI> &amp;c. and do tell the credulous Peo∣ple,
<PB N="94" REF="52"/>that their Adversaries out of meer Spight and Malice, do misrepresent them.</P>
<P>These <HI>Methods</HI> have been lately used (by an Eminent Papist here of my Ac∣quaintance and Neighborhood,) to some Persons of our <HI>Communion</HI> who were for∣merly my Parishioners, and seem'd to be warping towards <HI>Popery:</HI> They ac∣quainted me with it, and look'd upon those <HI>Sophisms</HI> to be nervous and strong Arguments and Motives, (and so in∣deed they were if they had been true,) to persuade them to change their Re∣ligion. But such shuffling Tricks as these carry their own Confutation a∣long with them; for this is an old piece of <HI>Legerdemain,</HI> which one would have thought should have been long since exploded. And I find the very same <HI>Hocus pocus,</HI> Illusions, used by the <HI>Po∣pish Priests,</HI> about the beginning of the Reign of Q. <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> For we know very well, what Priviledges are allow'd them to swear and forswear; and not only deny, but even rail against their own received <HI>Doctrins, Practices, Church,</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="52"/>and the <HI>Pope</HI> himself, for the Interest of the <HI>Catholick (i. e.)</HI> the <HI>Roman Religi∣on.</HI> Consult Dr. <HI>Nalson</HI>'s <HI>Foxes and Firebrands,</HI> and there you'l find many of their jugling Devices, and being Men of Latitude and Faculties to prepare Dishes for every Palate.</P>
<P>I have been a little more express in stating these <HI>Differences,</HI> because I know those <HI>Popish Emissaries</HI> are crept into all Countreys, and do every where lie in wait to debauch and corrupt Young Gentlemen, both in their <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Manners.</HI> There are not a few Instan∣ces of both, who have been taken Cap∣tives by them: I shall name Two parti∣cularly. The one a Person of good <HI>Qua∣lity,</HI> strong and quick natural <HI>Parts,</HI> an excellent <HI>Scholar,</HI> under the Conduct (as 'twas supposed,) of a well qualified <HI>Tutor,</HI> well educated according to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> by his pious and prudent Parents; and yet for all this, was perverted in his <HI>Travels,</HI> and con∣tinues a zealous and cunning <HI>Papist.</HI> There was another Gentleman also, both of my Acquaintance, not inferior to the
<PB N="96" REF="53"/>former, and every way as well fitted for Travel, yet did contract such a habit of <HI>Lewdness</HI> and <HI>Debauchery,</HI> (to say no worse,) that in few years an <HI>Estate</HI> of a∣bove 2000 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> is intirely wast∣ed, and nothing remains but a bare puff of Honour without any Estate to support it: I could tell you all the particulars by what Methods that unfortunate, sweet, and ingenuous Young Gentleman was allured and trapan'd into these <HI>Mischiefs,</HI> who also died immaturely, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which <HI>Examples</HI> amongst many others, have been often in my Thoughts: And tho there be not the least grounds of any Jealousie or Suspition of your Miscarri∣age, yet I have set them in your View as Land Marks, and Sea Marks, to prevent the danger of splitting your Vessel, (so well built and richly laden,) either upon the Sands and Shelves of <HI>Debauchery</HI> and <HI>Prophaneness,</HI> or the Rocks and Splinters of <HI>Schism</HI> and <HI>Superstition.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore (Dear Sir) let me beseech you once more to be continually upon your Watch, that you may return with the same Soul and same Body you car∣ried
<PB N="97" REF="53"/>from hence, and all the Tempers and Dispositions of both. And for this End endeavor throughly to understand, and then live up to the Principles and Rules of that Religion you have hither∣to profess'd. This will prove the best An∣tidote against that destructive <HI>Poison,</HI> which might otherwise taint and infect both your <HI>Intellectuals</HI> and <HI>Morals;</HI> and not only destroy the Christian, but even the Man (or rational part) within you.</P>
<P>Let me advise you still more <HI>particular∣ly,</HI> not so much as to lend an <HI>Ear</HI> to hear, nor a <HI>Tongue</HI> to discourse with those in∣chanting <HI>Syrens;</HI> be afraid of their seem∣ing Favours, whose Errand is Deceit, and under the pretence of Kindness and Re∣spect, will wound you to the very Heart. Look not upon the pompous Ceremonies and costly Ornaments of that <HI>Religion</HI> wherein all things are outwardly glori∣ous and pleasant to the Eye; but keep close to innocent Truth, and let your <HI>Soul</HI> be always deeply affected with that Wor∣ship whose Majesty is in the Heart, not in the Face, which we profess (with the greatest comfort and satisfaction, and
<PB N="98" REF="54"/>may we ever do so) in the Communion of the best of <HI>Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we have seen at length that the <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Superstitions</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> wherein they differ from Us, are <HI>Fundamental Points</HI> both of Faith and Worship: Therefore have no communi∣cation with those of that Way, unless it be where civil <HI>Relations,</HI> and <HI>Offices</HI> of <HI>Humanity</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> require your compliance.</P>
<P>Now, to conclude this Point, all the Members of the Church of <HI>England</HI> are called <HI>Protestants;</HI> a Name common to Us with our <HI>Brethren</HI> of the <HI>Reformed Churches</HI> beyond Sea, and so indeed we are: <Q REND="inline">For we do solemnly protest against the Popish Universal Hierarchy, Infalli∣ble Judgment, Dispensations with the Laws of God and Sins of Men, Oral Traditions and other Sacriledges, dispo∣sing of Kingdoms, deposing and Mur∣dering of Princes, the Merit of Good Works in our Conversion, the Priests pretended Power of transubstantiating Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Christ, the Sacrifice of the
<PB N="99" REF="54"/>Mass, Adoration of the Hostie, Images, Relicks, Prayers to Saints and Angels, Power of Indulgences, Doctrin of Pur∣gatory, necessity of Auricular Confessi∣on, Prohibition of Priests Marriages, Pilgrimages, Prayers in an unknown Tongue, multitude of Sacraments, Pe∣nances, Miracles and <HI>Indian</HI> Wonders, and pretences of curing the Deaf Dumb, Blind, Lame, and raising the Dead, Equi∣vocations, mental Reservations, pious Frauds, legendary Fables, devilish Incan∣tations, sacred, yet diabolical Magick, and all their other Delusions and Fop∣peries, as damnable and anti-christian.</Q> You'l be pleased (Sir) to join with me in this <HI>Protestation,</HI> (the very naming whereof, tho I cannot now insist upon all the Particulars, might almost induce you to it,) and let all true hearted and reform∣ed <HI>Protestants,</HI> both here and every where, say, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>There are also several other <HI>Religious Sects</HI> (or rather Hereticks,) which do err from the <HI>Foundation</HI> and the true <HI>Faith:</HI> Such are the <HI>Anti-Trinitarians, Arians, Socinians,</HI> &amp;c. who deny the
<PB N="100" REF="55"/><HI>Doctrin</HI> of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> the <HI>Divini∣ty of Christ and the Holy Ghost,</HI> and our <HI>Saviours Satisfaction:</HI> All which being excommunicated by Us, you must avoid them as the Pests, and Enemies of our <HI>Religion,</HI> and have no Intercourse nor Communion with them.</P>
<P>There's another silly <HI>Sect</HI> called <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> a People so far fallen from <HI>Christi∣anity,</HI> that they do scarce retain any one <HI>Article</HI> of the true <HI>Faith,</HI> slight and re∣ject all the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the <HI>Gospel;</HI> and extol the <HI>Light within them</HI> above the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> as the only sufficient <HI>Rule</HI> they are obliged to walk by. I on∣ly tell you in short, what <HI>Quakerism</HI> is, and shall need to say no more of it, be∣ing there's so little <HI>Temptation</HI> to that <HI>Opinion.</HI> Thus much by way of Digressi∣on. My method leads me,</P>
<P>Thirdly, To consider those <HI>Pretensi∣ons, Reasons</HI> and <HI>Arguments,</HI> which our <HI>Brethren</HI> of the <HI>Non-conformity</HI> have urg∣ed in defence of their Separation from Us. But to do them all the <HI>Justice</HI> ima∣ginable, I must note to you in the first place, That those called <HI>Antinomians,
<PB N="101" REF="55"/>Anabaptists, Independants,</HI> and <HI>Presby∣terians,</HI> do hold the Foundation, tho they differ from Us in some Opinions not essential to Salvation; and notwith∣standing their uncharitableness to Us, we account them <HI>Christians,</HI> and <HI>Bre∣thren,</HI> as holding the <HI>Essentials</HI> of <HI>Chri∣stianity,</HI> tho they build upon a weak Foundation.</P>
<P>And seeing <HI>Providence</HI> has led you into those Countries for the present, where you cannot worship God accord∣ing to your own Way; the <HI>Church of England,</HI> both in her <HI>Judgment</HI> and <HI>Prac∣tice,</HI> allows you to communicate with those Sister-Churches of the <HI>Reformati∣on,</HI> to whom we have always given the right Hand of Fellowship, tho there be some circumstantial Differences be∣tween Them and Us. But,</P>
<P>You'l probably meet with some in your <HI>Travels,</HI> as well as in our own <HI>Na∣tion,</HI> who will be very forward to find Faults with and censure our <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Discipline,</HI> (as we have many of that ca∣pricious Humour amongst Us, tho they scarce understand it. Therefore for the
<PB N="102" REF="56"/>further Confirmation and Establishment of your own Judgment herein, and that you may be better fortified with <HI>Reasons</HI> and <HI>Arguments</HI> to vindicate our <HI>Church,</HI> and clear those <HI>Objections</HI> which may be urged against her. We shall consider,</P>
<P>First, The most material <HI>Objections,</HI> which have been formed against our <HI>Li∣turgy</HI> and <HI>Church Politie,</HI> both at home and abroad.</P>
<P>Secondly, We shall draw some ratio∣nal <HI>Inferences</HI> from those <HI>Answers</HI> and <HI>So∣lutions,</HI> for your further satisfaction. And,</P>
<P>Thirdly, Lay down some <HI>Rules</HI> by way of <HI>caution,</HI> which I hope may se∣cure you, and by your Influence, many others from a groundless <HI>Separation.</HI> Of these distinctly: And,</P>
<P>First, All the Scruples of our <HI>Non∣conforming Brethren,</HI> against our <HI>Disci∣pline and Set Form of Worship,</HI> are re∣ducible to, and comprehended under these two <HI>Objections.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1. They charge Us with <HI>Popery,</HI> (which we abhor as much, if not more than they do,) because (say they) our <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Common Prayer</HI> by Law esta∣blisht,
<PB N="103" REF="56"/>is taken out of the <HI>Popish Mass-Book,</HI> that they are <HI>Popish Prayers;</HI> and much of our <HI>Discipline,</HI> and many of our <HI>Ceremonies</HI> are now used in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> Which <HI>Objection</HI> at the first appearance, seems to be very harsh; and has so affrighted some weak, yet well-meaning <HI>Christians,</HI> that they dare scarce come near Us, but hold off, and se∣parate from our <HI>Communion.</HI> To which I</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> This <HI>Objection</HI> is so far from being of any force against Us, that it do's very much approve and justifie the sin∣gular <HI>Moderation</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as most willing and desirous to communicate with the <HI>Papists</HI> in all Things wherein we can do it lawfully, and with a safe Conscience. Besides, those <HI>Divines</HI> who compiled our <HI>Liturgy,</HI> were all Men of extraordinary Parts, Piety and Learning, and several of them died <HI>Martyrs</HI> for our <HI>Religion.</HI> Nor have our <HI>dissenting Brethren</HI> the least colour of Reason to brand our <HI>Church Service</HI> with savouring too much of <HI>Popery,</HI> seeing the <HI>Papists</HI> always have, and ever had our <HI>Worship</HI> in the greatest detestation
<PB N="104" REF="57"/>and abhorrence; because they know 'tis impossible that <HI>Popery</HI> should ever return upon Us, or be establisht again in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> while our <HI>Common-Prayer-Book</HI> is kept unaltered.</P>
<P>For, the whole Form of our <HI>Worship</HI> is point blank contrary to <HI>Image-Wor∣ship,</HI> praying to <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Saints, Pro∣pitiatory Sacrifice, Doctrin</HI> of their <HI>Sacra∣ments, Transubstantiation,</HI> &amp;c. And this is the true Reason why they do so mor∣tally hate both <HI>Ʋs</HI> and our <HI>Religion.</HI> And again, those <HI>Prayers</HI> in our <HI>Liturgy</HI> which were taken out of the <HI>Mass-Book,</HI> are many of them the <HI>Collects</HI> and <HI>Devo∣tions</HI> of the Antient <HI>Fathers,</HI> which were in use before ever <HI>Popery</HI> was known in the World; which being purged from the <HI>Popish Superstition</HI> by our <HI>Reform∣ers,</HI> are now lawfully used by the <HI>Church of England,</HI> according to their <HI>Original Institution:</HI> Insomuch, that those who cavil at our Service, because some part of it is used by the <HI>Papists,</HI> may as well find fault with the <HI>Epistles and Gospels, Psalms, Chapters, Creeds, Commandments, Lords Prayer,</HI> &amp;c. these being also in
<PB N="105" REF="57"/>the Papists <HI>Mass-Book.</HI> Having fully cleared this first <HI>Objection,</HI> we pass to the</P>
<P N="2">2. And they charge Us again with many <HI>Corruptions, Additions, De∣fects,</HI> and circumstantial <HI>Errors</HI> in our <HI>Set Form of Worship and Discipline,</HI> (for they have no Objections against our Doctrin and Fundamentals;) and for those seeming Reasons, they think them∣selves obliged to withdraw and separate from our <HI>Communion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> This may seem to be a weigh∣ty <HI>Objection</HI> at the first sight, and the most plead it (being joined with the former, which we have answered to the full,) as the Cause, why they think and speak so hardly of our Church, and desert our Communion: But they might be per∣suaded to alter their Opinion, if (laying aside all <HI>Prejudice,</HI>) they would but seri∣ously and impartially consider these few Things. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis a true and undoubted <HI>Maxim,</HI> that all Persons are obliged to hold <HI>Com∣munion</HI> with the National and Establish'd <HI>Church</HI> where they live, and must by no means separate from it; tho there be
<PB N="106" REF="58"/>some circumstantial <HI>Additions, Errors</HI> and <HI>Defects,</HI> in its external <HI>Worship, Po∣litie</HI> or <HI>Discipline.</HI> For 'tis plain, that the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> did not sepa∣rate from, but held Communion with the <HI>Jews</HI> in their <HI>Publick Worship,</HI> tho there were very many and great Defects and Corruptions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> both in their <HI>Doctrin</HI> and <HI>Practice.</HI> This is clear in many <HI>In∣stances:</HI> For the solemn <HI>Ordinances</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> as <HI>Circumcision</HI> and the <HI>Passover,</HI> were for a long time a-wanting; and such <HI>Monuments</HI> of <HI>Idolatry</HI> were set up, as not only the People thereby became su∣perstitious and immoral, but even the Priests also (as <HI>Eli</HI>'s two Sons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) brought a Scandal upon their <HI>Religion.</HI> Were not these greater Faults than any of our fiercest Adversaries can charge up∣on us? And yet for all that, we sind not one President of so much as any single Person that departed from their Com∣munion.</P>
<P N="2">2. At the time of our B. <HI>Saviours</HI> coming into the World, the <HI>Jewish Worship</HI> was exceedingly corrupted with the <HI>Leaven</HI> of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> &amp; the <HI>Heresie</HI> of the <HI>Sad∣duces,</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="58"/>who denied the Immortality of the Soul and the Resurrection of the Body. Besides, the whole <HI>Service</HI> of <HI>God</HI> was intolerably prophaned, the <HI>Temple</HI> pol∣luted, <HI>Religion</HI> subverted, <HI>Judgment</HI> and the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>God</HI> trampled upon and neg∣lected, many needless and superstitious <HI>Ceremonies</HI> interlarded with their <HI>Wor∣ship,</HI> the <HI>People.</HI> addicted to all manner of <HI>Wickedness,</HI> and even the <HI>Priests</HI> them∣selves very heterodox and dissolute both in their <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Manners:</HI> And yet at that time, we find several religious Per∣sons, both Men and Women, with great Zeal and Devotion, worshiping God in the Temple, as <HI>Zachary</HI> and <HI>Simeon, Han∣nah</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> &amp;c. And our Blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> himself was (by his pious Pa∣rents) presented in the Temple according to the Custom and Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> He af∣terwards kept the <HI>Passover,</HI> and all the <HI>Festivals</HI> of the <HI>Jewish Church,</HI> frequented and taught daily in the <HI>Temple</HI> &amp; in their <HI>Synagogues,</HI> gave <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Reverence,</HI> and paid <HI>Tribute</HI> to their <HI>Rulers;</HI> nor did he ever desert their Communion, till he was forced to retire to save his own Life:
<PB N="108" REF="59"/>So that he thought it necessary (and so did those other Votaries) to join in Gods <HI>Publick Worship,</HI> notwithstanding those great <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Defects,</HI> which thanks be to God, are not chargeable upon Us. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. There were many Errors and De∣fects, both in the <HI>Doctrin</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of the then slourishing <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Corinth, Galatia,</HI> &amp;c. and yet the Apostle S. <HI>Paul</HI> was so far from encouraging a <HI>Schism</HI> in, and <HI>Separation</HI> from the <HI>Communion</HI> of those <HI>Churches;</HI> that he threatens those Persons with the severest Punishments, who were the Instruments in fomenting and promoting those <HI>Animosities</HI> and <HI>Di∣visions.</HI> Nor is there any one <HI>Instance</HI> or <HI>President</HI> in the whole <HI>Scripture,</HI> to war∣rant our departure from any Church that is Sound and Orthodox in her <HI>Principles,</HI> however erroneous and corrupt in the <HI>Politie</HI> and <HI>Circumstantials</HI> of <HI>Divine Worship.</HI> We might hereunto add,</P>
<P N="4">4. The concurrent <HI>Judgments</HI> and <HI>O∣pinions</HI> of the most Eminent and Re∣formed <HI>Divines</HI> beyond Sea; who have unanimously declared their Dislike of a Separation from our <HI>Communion;</HI> as <HI>Cal∣vin,
<PB N="109" REF="59"/>Bullinger, Bucer,</HI> and many others. And tho they dissented from Us in lesser Things, yet held Communion and Cor∣respondence with our <HI>Church</HI> &amp; <HI>Church∣men,</HI> as may appear by their several <HI>Let∣ters</HI> to our <HI>Reformers;</HI> and would have been glad if their Circumstances would have allowed our Form of <HI>Church Po∣litie;</HI> and deservedly preferr'd it to any <HI>Church Government</HI> in the World. But to argue yet more closely;</P>
<P N="5">5. If any will refuse our <HI>Communion,</HI> and separate from Us, because there are some pretended Errors in the <HI>Discipline</HI> and <HI>Circumstantials</HI> of our <HI>Worship,</HI> (which yet none have ever been able to prove against Us,) they'l be obliged up∣on the same score, to withdraw their <HI>Communion</HI> from all the <HI>Churches</HI> in <HI>Chri∣stendom:</HI> For what <HI>Church Government</HI> shall they be ever able to assign, that's so pure and sincere, as to be wholly exemp∣ted from <HI>Circumstantial Errors</HI> and <HI>De∣fects?</HI> And were there not more Faults in the Worship of the <HI>Primitive Churches</HI> for the five first <HI>Centuries,</HI> than are at present in Ours? Are there no Errors in
<PB N="110" REF="60"/>the <HI>Worship, Constitutions,</HI> and <HI>Ecclesia∣stical Government</HI> of <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Amster∣dam?</HI> I'm sure many of their Learned <HI>Divines</HI> have ingenuously acknowledg'd that all things were not according to their Desire, and yet did not think it Prudence to alter the Government for the sake of some small Errors.</P>
<P>In short, our <HI>Dissenting Brethren</HI> must either disclaim these <HI>Conceits,</HI> or turn <HI>Hermits</HI> and <HI>Anchorets,</HI> live in a <HI>Cell</HI> or <HI>Wilderness,</HI> and even depart from them∣selves; who (as I could easily shew them) are guilty of as many, if not more, and greater Faults and Errors in their little Assemblies, than can be justly charged upon <HI>Ʋs,</HI> or the <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> Whither would not these wild and extravagant Fancies carry any Man that shall give way to them? So that they must either prove their own Churches to be infallible in point of <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>Discipline,</HI> which I think the most of them disclaim, or for ever quit their <HI>Pretensions</HI> for a <HI>Separa∣tion</HI> from Us, because of the little Er∣rors which they have discovered in our <HI>Administrations.</HI></P>
<PB N="111" REF="60"/>
<P>Having thus fully answer'd the chief <HI>Objections</HI> of our Brethren for their un∣warrantable <HI>Separation</HI> from the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> which I know will fully sa∣tisfie you. We shall proceed,</P>
<P>Secondly, To draw some clear and un∣deniable <HI>Inferences</HI> from the <HI>Premises,</HI> for the prevention of all further <HI>Scruples</HI> in this Case. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. It would be a strange Delusion, and no less than absolute <HI>Prophaneness</HI> to cast off all the <HI>Publick Ordinances,</HI> or neglect the <HI>Sacred</HI> and <HI>Solemn Worship</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> because some things may be disliked, or excepted against in their <HI>Administrations</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The greatest Honour we can ascribe to God, is to worship solemnly and de∣voutly in the <HI>Publick Assemblies</HI> of the <HI>Church:</HI> And therefore it must be the most heinous Crime to make a Schism and Rent in any particular <HI>Church,</HI> where <HI>Christ</HI> is effectually present by his <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Spirit.</HI> Nor can any one have a suf∣ficient <HI>Plea,</HI> to withdraw from the <HI>Pub∣lick Ordinances</HI> in any <HI>Nation,</HI> till <HI>Christ</HI> has deserted them; which no Man can object against the <HI>Pure</HI> and <HI>Apostolical
<PB N="112" REF="61"/>Church of England:</HI> Wherein (as before) the whole World will acknowledge, that the <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is purely preach'd, and the <HI>Sacraments</HI> duly administred in that admirable <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Ʋniformity,</HI> which is scarce to be parallel'd in any <HI>National Church</HI> upon <HI>Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, those who are so strait laced as to require absolute Perfection in the Administration of <HI>Divine Offices</HI> and <HI>Church Government,</HI> must be guilty of that <HI>Popish Error,</HI> in confining the <HI>Church,</HI> with all its <HI>Priviledges</HI> and <HI>Im∣munities,</HI> to their own <HI>Sect</HI> and <HI>Party;</HI> and so cast off a considerable <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Catholick Church,</HI> (as the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> is at this Day,) which professes and practises all the <HI>Essentials</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Worship.</HI> Hence we also infer,</P>
<P N="3">3. That many great and unavoidable <HI>Mischiefs</HI> do always attend a wilful and unlawful <HI>Separation:</HI> For a <HI>Scissure</HI> in and departure from a <HI>True Church,</HI> (as the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> is, and none of our severest <HI>Adversaries</HI> can deny,) is most dishonourable and displeasing to <HI>God,</HI> a scandal to <HI>Religion,</HI> hinders the Success
<PB N="113" REF="61"/>of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> opens a wide Gap to <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Prophaneness, Heresie</HI> and <HI>Popery</HI> and is a dismal <HI>Presage</HI> of the removing of our <HI>Candlestick,</HI> Mat. 12.25. Why then should any Persons withdraw and separate them∣selves from the <HI>Communion</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> for the sake of a few <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> and set up <HI>Altar</HI> against <HI>Altar,</HI> and hereby put an Opportunity into the Adversaries hands, to ruin both us and themselves? But,</P>
<P N="4">4. Tho all Persons in this Nation are obliged to hold <HI>Communion</HI> with the <HI>Church of England,</HI> (seeing those pretend∣ed Defects in her are only modal and cir∣cumstantial, which no <HI>Church</HI> in the <HI>World</HI> can be free from in this State of Tryal and Probation,) yet we are sorbidden to communicate with any <HI>Church</HI> in <HI>Sin:</HI> And this is the true reason and ground of forsaking the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> because her <HI>Errors</HI> are <HI>Fundamental,</HI> (as we have seen already,) and the Conditions of <HI>Communi∣on</HI> with her such, as we cannot comply with, unless we offer Violence to our own <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Conscience.</HI> And we do always solemnly declare, that if their New <HI>Arti∣cles</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and unchristian <HI>Practices</HI> did not hinder Us, we should most freely
<PB N="114" REF="62"/>and chearfully communicate with her; nor do we further depart from her, than she departs from <HI>Christ</HI> and her <HI>Self,</HI> as to her antient <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Worship.</HI></P>
<P>And again, we have so much Love and Charity for our <HI>modern Dissenters</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> that if any one has a truly tender Conscience, so as after a diligent and faithful use of all convenient and necessa∣ry <HI>Means</HI> and <HI>Methods</HI> for his Conviction, (as earnest Prayer to God, reading of good Books, consultation with his Parish-Minister, or some other Pious and Learn∣ed Divine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he still remains scrupulous and unsatisfied; yet rather than sin against his own Con∣science, we do not blame, but pity him, if he modestly withdraws from our Com∣munion. But I am afraid there are some who have not practised these Methods, altho I have the Charity to believe that very many have; and that most of those who have separated from our <HI>Communion,</HI> have not done it through a wilful Obsti∣nacy, but meerly upon the account of Conscience.</P>
<P N="5">5. Our Brethren of the Non-conformi∣ty might do well to consider also, that
<PB N="115" REF="62"/>none gains any thing by a groundless <HI>Schism</HI> and <HI>Separation,</HI> but that sort of Men whose chief Maxim to promote their own Ends, hath always been, <HI>Divide &amp; impera:</HI> For 'tis very observable that the Interest of the Reform'd Religion is daily weaken'd by our unchristian and intestine Divisions. And 'tis very certain, that we cannot do our Enemies greater Service nor more precipitate our own Ruine, than by crumbling our selves into <HI>Sects</HI> and <HI>Parties:</HI> Insomuch, that I am afraid, that those who now separate from Us, and (in this juncture) forsake our Communion, will one day find and feel to their great cost (not to mention the present <HI>Mischiefs</HI>) that it were a thousand times better to swallow an innocent <HI>Ceremony</HI> than rend a <HI>Church;</HI> seeing the greatest Sins shall have a lighter Punishment than <HI>Schism</HI> and <HI>Separation. For the Eye that mocketh his Father, and despiseth the Garment of his Mother, the Ravens of the Valley shall pluck it out, and the young Eagles devour it.</HI> See further upon the Mischiefs of <HI>Schism,</HI> Dr. <HI>Falkners Libertas Eccles.</HI> from the be∣ginning. Which brings me to the,</P>
<P>Third and last thing, Which will be to
<PB N="116" REF="63"/>lay down some <HI>Rules</HI> by way of <HI>Caution</HI> and <HI>Advice,</HI> which may secure you, and by your <HI>Influence,</HI> many others from a groundless <HI>Separation.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1. We must be subject to every <HI>Ordi∣nance</HI> of <HI>Man for the Lords sake:</HI> For they are Gods Ministers, and the supreme Ma∣gistrate of these Kingdoms is invested with Sovereign Power and Authority to order and administer the Affairs of Go∣vernment, for the peace and benefit of Mens Souls, as well as their Bodies and Estates: Nor can this seem strange to a∣ny one, who either understands the <HI>Scrip∣tures</HI> or <HI>Ecclesiastical History:</HI> For 'tis plain, that the religious Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> &amp; <HI>Israel,</HI> as King <HI>David, Solomon, Asa Jeho∣shaphat, Hezekiah,</HI> &amp;c. and all the <HI>Christi∣an Emperors,</HI> as <HI>Constantine the Great</HI> and his <HI>Successors,</HI> (till the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI>'s Usurpation,) were as much concern'd in ordering of the Affairs of the Church, as the Administration of Civil Government. And indeed, unless this Power and Sove∣raignty were allow'd to the Supreme Ma∣gistrate, he should be unable to provide for the benefit of his Subjects; nor could there be any such thing as <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Ʋni∣formity</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="63"/>in the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Christ;</HI> the <HI>Ec∣clesiastical Laws</HI> being only <HI>Bruta fulmina</HI> without the concurrence and enforcement of the Civil Power: So that from hence it must needs follow, that a cheerful Obedi∣ence to and a hearty Compliance with all the Laws and Constitutions of our admi∣rable Government, both in Church and State, is absolutely necessary, not only for our own sakes, but the Peace and Preser∣vation of the whole Body.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis a strange Mistake then which some have run upon, that nothing is to be admitted in our <HI>Publick Worship,</HI> and <HI>Ec∣clesiastical Discipline</HI> and <HI>Politie</HI> of our <HI>Church,</HI> but what is <HI>plainly exprest in the Holy Scriptures;</HI> hereby excluding all hu∣man <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Constitutions</HI> in Matters and Things indisserent. Which wild <HI>Hy∣pothesis</HI> has been the Original of all those untenable <HI>Opinions</HI> now on foot; and the very most of our <HI>unchristian Divisions,</HI> which have almost torn in pieces our Church, are owing to this unreasonable and groundless <HI>Conjecture:</HI> Whereas on the contrary, the Writers of the greatest Note and Eminence amongst our Brethren of the Non-conformity, are forced to ac∣knowledge,
<PB N="118" REF="64"/>that there are many <HI>Circum∣stances</HI> in the <HI>Public Service of God,</HI> and the <HI>Government of the Church,</HI> which must be regulated and order'd according to the <HI>Light of Nature,</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Christian Prudence;</HI> as the holy Apostle directs in those general Rules, <HI>Let all things be done decently in order, and for Edification.</HI> And do also confess, that even in their own As∣semblies (and we know it to be true and certain,) there are many such <HI>Circumstan∣ces,</HI> for which they have no <HI>express Rule</HI> in Scripture; but do use them <HI>prudentially</HI> for the Honour and Interest of <HI>Religion,</HI> and the Order &amp; Uniformity of Gods <HI>Worship.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, 'tis observable that the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> treat chiefly of the <HI>Essentials</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> and only mention the <HI>Governours</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> with some general Rules (as before) for the ordering of its <HI>Politie</HI> and <HI>Discipline:</HI> Insomuch, that <HI>many Persons of great Lear∣ning and Judgment</HI> are of opinion, that there's no one <HI>Set-Form of Government</HI> for the <HI>Christian Church</HI> to be found in the whole <HI>Bible,</HI> but must be left to our Go∣vernours to order and appoint according to the Rules and Dictates of sound Judg∣ment
<PB N="119" REF="64"/>and Discretion: Which the Learn∣ed and Judicious <HI>Hooker</HI> gives a most ad∣mirable Account of in his <HI>Ecclesiast. Polit.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can this in the least impeach (as some have vainly objected the Sufficien∣cy of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> or the Fidelity of <HI>Christ</HI> in not leaving a perfect <HI>Model</HI> of <HI>Church Government</HI> behind him: For we have seen already, that the <HI>Holy Scrip∣tures</HI> were primarily intended to instruct us in the <HI>Fundamentals</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Chri∣stian Morality,</HI> and speak only overtly of <HI>Church Discipline</HI> and <HI>Government.</HI> And, for the Fidelity of <HI>Christ</HI> herein, 'tis plain that the Church in our Saviours Time was in her <HI>Minority,</HI> which must after∣wards (by degrees) grow up to a state of greater <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Perfection.</HI> What o∣thers have urged from the Form of <HI>Church Government</HI> under the <HI>Jewish Oeconomie</HI> concludes nothing: For the <HI>Jews</HI> lived all under one <HI>Politie</HI> and in one <HI>Nation;</HI> whereas <HI>Christianity</HI> is dispersed all over the World, under many disserent <HI>Civil Go∣vernments;</HI> and therefore the <HI>Circumstan∣ces</HI> of Religious <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>Church Disci∣pline,</HI> must be suited to the State and Con∣dition of different People within their se∣veral
<PB N="120" REF="65"/>Jurisdictions, as may appear most just and reasonable to the Judgments and Discretion of their lawful Governours. Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. Tho every Person be obliged to hate and flie from Idolatry, Heresie, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet none should be affrighted from his Duty with meer <HI>Buggs</HI> and <HI>Scar-crows,</HI> or the empty Appearances of <HI>Error</HI> without suf∣ficient Grounds. For tho our <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Set-Forms</HI> of <HI>Worship</HI> have been extream∣ly cavil'd at by some of our Adversaries, yet 'tis evident that neither the <HI>Prophets</HI> of old, nor our <HI>Saviour</HI> and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> nor the <HI>Primitive Fathers,</HI> did ever find fault with the Stated Methods and Forms of Prayer, but did practise and appoint 'em themselves, and highly encourag'd them in others. For there are many <HI>Set-Forms</HI> of <HI>Prayer, Benedictions</HI> and <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> in the Writings of the <HI>Prophets;</HI> our Savi∣our composed a <HI>Form of Prayer</HI> to be used by his <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Followers,</HI> (tho they were doubtless as able to pray by the Spi∣rit as the most Seraphick <HI>Enthusiast,</HI>) which <HI>Method</HI> also was observed by <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> for the direction and assistance of his <HI>Disciples</HI> in God's <HI>Worship.</HI> All
<PB N="121" REF="65"/>which <HI>Stated Forms</HI> became Patterns and Presidents to the Churches of <HI>Christ</HI> in af∣ter Ages, who had all their several <HI>Litur∣gies</HI> as we have; nor is there any thing in our <HI>Service Book</HI> which is contrary to, but most exactly conformable to those <HI>Rules.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Let not the bare Pretence then of some small Errors in and about the Cir∣cumstances of <HI>Publick Worship,</HI> prevail with any Man to separate from the Com∣munion of his <HI>National Church,</HI> seeing there have been, and are as many, and pro∣bably greater Errors in all the Churches of <HI>Christ</HI> in all Ages of the Gospel: For tho our Blessed Saviour promis'd, <HI>that the Gates of Hell should not prevail against the Ʋniversal Church, that he will be with her to the end of the World, send his Spirit to lead her into all Truth, and abide with her for ever;</HI> yet these <HI>Promises</HI> do only respect the Fundamental Doctrins of the Catholic and Universal Church of <HI>Christ,</HI> or a People professing the Truth, how∣ever they may err (as all of them do) in Opinions not essential to <HI>Religion.</HI> And seeing every particular Church may be guilty of some Errors and Mistakes in out∣ward Circumstances of Religion, there∣fore
<PB N="122" REF="66"/>fore he that will separate upon this Ac∣count can scarce hold Communion with any National Church upon Earth. And those fickle and fanciful Persons might have had the same <HI>Plea,</HI> to have separated from the Christian Church in the time of the Apostles that they have now from Us: Nor is there any one that under∣stands the State of our Church, but will readily acknowledge, that our Orders of <HI>Bishops Priests</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> and <HI>Set Form</HI> of <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>Discipline,</HI> are if not of A∣postolical,) yet of Primitive Institution.</P>
<P N="5">5. No meer Inconveniences, or circum∣stantial Errors or Defects and those only alledged, not proved against Us, can justi∣fie or excuse a <HI>Departure</HI> from Us, since I have made it fully evident that our Church holds and maintains all the <HI>Essen∣tials</HI> both of <HI>Faith</HI> and of <HI>Worship.</HI> For, we have seen already, that all Men are oblig'd to conform themselves to the Constitutions of their National Church, tho some of the external Modes &amp; Forms be inconvenient, disorderly and defective, rather than not be of any Church at all: And what they cannot reform without disturbing the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI>) 'tis
<PB N="123" REF="66" MS="y"/>their Duty to tolerate, seeing there's no Na∣tional and Particular Church in the World, (as we have already observed) whose Con∣stitutions and Government are absolutely perfect. Therefore,</P>
<P N="6">6. Those Persons are extreamly to blame that require greater <HI>Purity</HI> in Gods <HI>Public Wor∣ship,</HI> than the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> have command∣ed, or our Blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> or the Primitive Orthodox <HI>Fathers</HI> have re∣commended to Posterity. And tho there were some things amiss in the outward <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>Government:</HI> Yet 'tis not the Province, nor in the power of private Men to reform <HI>Religion;</HI> this being wholly lest to the prudent management of those <HI>Go∣vernours,</HI> whom the divine Providence has constituted and appointed to rule over Us. Wherefore that precipitant and rash <HI>Zeal</HI> (which some miscall <HI>Puty</HI>) will more disturb the Peace of their own Consciences, and pre∣judice the Interest of the Church, than their charitable and peaceable Compliance with those seeming Error, and Defects, which they so much cavil at and complain of.</P>
<P N="7">7. 'Tis the greatest Argument then of Im∣prudence and Indiscretion, to run upon ma∣nifest and real Evils, upon those Fears and Jealousies (which are meerly groundless) and only imagin'd to be so. Will any Man of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> dare to forsake Gods pub∣lick Ordinances, and make a <HI>Schism</HI> in the Church of <HI>Christ,</HI> because perhaps there may
<PB N="124" REF="67"/>be some probable <HI>Defects</HI> in her <HI>Communion.</HI> For Gods Commands to attend his Publick Worship, and endeavour the Peace of the Church, are plain and positive, whereas the <HI>Errors</HI> objected against us are dubious and dis∣putable: And now, to cast the <HI>Scales,</HI> the far greater number of pious, learned &amp; judicious <HI>Men</HI> are on our <HI>side;</HI> so, that for any thing they know, they may be mistaken. But granting 'em that we do err, let our <HI>Governours</HI> see to it, we have a sufficient Rule for our Obedi∣ence, (nor dare we substract it for the sake of an Inconvenience only, if their <HI>Commands</HI> be not sinful) but they have none for their Disobedience. And therefore seeing they have no lawful Authority to reform the least Er∣ror or Mistake in Government, it would be the greater Prudence, and more Christian like to pray &amp; mourn in secret for what they ap∣prehend amiss, than to disobey and exaspe∣rate their Governours, stir up Divisions in the Church, &amp; run upon the dangerous <HI>Hazzards</HI> of a licentious and unwarrantable <HI>Separation.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. We should be always more concern'd for promoting the Interest of the <HI>Gospel</HI> and our own <HI>National Church,</HI> than the gratifying of our own personal and private <HI>Fancies</HI> and <HI>Opinions.</HI> For it has been a great fault in most of our Brethren of the Non-conformity, who have been so wedded to their own pri∣vate Humours and Conceits, that they have almost quite forgot the <HI>Peace of the Church,</HI> and the true <HI>Interest</HI> of the <HI>Protestant Reform'd
<PB N="125" REF="67"/>Religion.</HI> Hence have sprung those <HI>Heresies</HI> and <HI>Schisms,</HI> and that <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Prophaneness,</HI> which have so strangely over-spread the whole Nation, to the great scandal of our Religion and Government; and have done what in their power lies to yield up them∣selves and us a Prey to our cruel and merci∣less Enemies. Whereas, if they had the least sense of their Duty and Interest, they would keep close (at this Time especially) to our <HI>Communion;</HI> which under God would be their chief Refuge, and yield in some small Mat∣ters, tho less agreeable to their own private Sentiments and Opinions, for the greater Benefit of the Publick.</P>
<P N="9">9. No <HI>Prejudice</HI> should prevail with any Man so far, as to make him unwilling to re∣cant and disclaim his <HI>Errors</HI> upon a through Conviction, and return to the ways of Truth and Peace, from which he has formerly er∣red. And therefore 'tis a great Fault in many who are unwilling to retract those Errors which they have espoused, lest they should be censured by their <HI>Party</HI> as <HI>Renegadoes</HI> and <HI>Apostates</HI> from their <HI>Religion:</HI> Whereas, if they would but seriously consider it, 'twill be their greatest Honour as well as Interest, and a special Evidence of their Integrity, to acknowledg &amp; recant their <HI>Errors</HI> &amp; <HI>Mistakes;</HI> nor need any Man be asham'd or afraid to confess he has erred. St. <HI>Aug.</HI> writ a whole Book of <HI>Retractations,</HI> for which he was deser∣vedly as much esteem'd, as for any of his o∣ther
<PB N="126" REF="68"/>Works: Nor can any Man come under the vile imputation and scandal of an <HI>Apo∣state,</HI> who changes only some mistaken Er∣rors and Opinions, not his <HI>Religion.</HI> And</P>
<P>Lastly, Others have been extreamly to blame in setting up their own private Glos∣ses and Interpretations of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> as infallible <HI>Maxims</HI> and necessary <HI>Conclusions,</HI> insomuch that they I rather disturb the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Community,</HI> than be persuaded to recede from them: For being ignorant of the scope and meaning of those sacred and lively <HI>Ora∣cles,</HI> they presently sancy without the least true ground, that every <HI>Passage</HI> founding that Way, must be a strong and forcible <HI>Argument</HI> to prove and confirm their <HI>Opinion.</HI> The <HI>Scrip∣tures</HI> indeed be allowed, and are of important and necessary use for the Conduct of their <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> in the ways of <HI>Religion:</HI> But then shall every <HI>Mechanick</HI> presume to be an Interpreter and Judge (and think himself as infallible as the Pope in <HI>Cathedra</HI>) of all the abstruse and difficult <HI>Passages</HI> in <HI>Holy Writ?</HI></P>
<P>Now, what can it be but meer <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> and <HI>Delusion</HI> in any one to pretend to inter∣pret the dark Points of Scripture, (which nei∣ther concern Mens Faith nor Manners) with∣out the use of those <HI>Means</HI> which are out of the reach of the <HI>Vulgar?</HI> They'l readily grant, that in all other <HI>Professions, Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> a Man must be a considerable time, and take great pains to gain <HI>Experience</HI> ere he can be ca∣pable of managing, and must be an approved
<PB N="127" REF="68"/><HI>Artist</HI> before any one will entrust him with Business in his way of Dealings in the World. Shall every <HI>Novice</HI> then who can scarce read a Chapter distinctly in the <HI>Bible,</HI> presume to have as much Skill in <HI>Divinity</HI> and the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> as he that has been train'd up all his life in the <HI>Schools</HI> of the <HI>Prophets;</HI> has the ad¦vantage of all useful <HI>Books,</HI> understands the <HI>Languages</HI> wherein the <HI>Scriptures</HI> were <HI>origi∣nally written,</HI> and makes this <HI>Study</HI> his whole <HI>Business</HI> and <HI>Profession?</HI> These are such wild and extravagant <HI>Conceits,</HI> as one would think that no Man of common Reason and Pru∣dence should once pretend to: And yet there are several illiterate country <HI>Hobs,</HI> and con∣ceited <HI>Tradesmen</HI> in Market Towns (and of my acquaintance, as there are in most pla∣ces of this Kingdom,) who'l undertake to in∣terpret the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and preach (according to their way; and yet) with more boldness and confidence than the greatest Doctors of the <HI>Chair.</HI> But we leave such to their own Fancies and Delusions, which can neither concern you nor me more at present, than to pity and pray for them, that they may come in due time to a true sense of their unaccom∣table Errors, and (whilst unretracted) unpar∣donable Mistakes.</P>
<P>These I am persuaded are such <HI>Reasons,</HI> as will puzzle our <HI>Dissenting Brethren</HI> to answer, and obviate all their <HI>Pleay</HI> and <HI>Pretences</HI> to a warrantable <HI>Separation</HI> from the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England:</HI> However (Sir) such as they are, are
<PB N="128" REF="69"/>humbly offer'd to your serious Perusal; and probably they may be useful to you in your present Circumstances, having calculated them primarily for that <HI>Meridian.</HI> Yet let not these or any other so bind you up, as to neglect greater and better of your own: For it will be your great Interest and Advantage to weigh and measure the Drift and Design of all <HI>Counsels,</HI> by the Dictates of your own Reason and Judgment.</P>
<P>I doubt I have wearied your Patience with a tedious <HI>Epistle;</HI> the <HI>Subjects</HI> being so copious have drawn it out to an undue <HI>Proportion.</HI> Yet, when you have seriously consider'd the <HI>Scope</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> of it in its full Latitude and Im∣portance, I hope you'l candidly excuse not only the <HI>Length,</HI> but all other <HI>Mistakes</HI> and <HI>Defects</HI> in it without any further Apology. Whatever <HI>Indiscretions</HI> I have been guilty of either in the Undertaking, or management and composure of this <HI>Discourse,</HI> are wholly imputable to my <HI>Self;</HI> none of your <HI>Relati∣ons</HI> or <HI>Friends</HI> being yet acquainted with it. For all which I do most earnestly and hum∣bly beg your Pardon. Now, that <HI>God Al∣mighty</HI> may ever bless, preserve, succeed, and prosper you in your Progress and Return; and that all your <HI>Endeavours</HI> may be accep∣table to Him, well-pleasing to your Friends, and a comfort and benefit to your Self, shall be the most earnest, hearty, and constant Prayer of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Prayer of, <HI>Honoured SIR,</HI></SALUTE>
