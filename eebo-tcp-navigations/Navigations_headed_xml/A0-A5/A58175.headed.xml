Death of
that Reverend
and Worthy
Prelate, <HI>John</HI>
Lord Bishop of <HI>Chester,</HI> to
whom the Dedication of this
Work was intended, several
weighty considerations indu∣ced
me to recommend it to your
<PB REF="3"/>
Patronage. As first, that I
might thereby take occasion
publicly to own my Obligati∣ons
to you, and profess my
gratitude. 2. Because having
been much assisted in the Com∣piling
thereof by your Notes
and Communications; you have
so great interest in it, that
it's but equal I should present
you with it. 3. Having tra∣velled
constantly in your Com∣pany,
during my continuance
beyond the Seas, you are well
acquainted with most of the
particulars therein delivered,
and can attest the truth of
them if any one should questi∣on
or deny it. As for the Work
it self, my first design was on∣ly
a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of <HI>outlandish</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
Plants <HI>of my own discover∣ing,</HI>
such as grew wild be∣yond
Sea, and were not com∣mon
to us in <HI>England.</HI> The
<HI>English Observations</HI> are but
an accession to the <HI>Catalogue,</HI>
and intended only to help de∣liver
the Press of that.
Wherefore being hudled up
in some haste, upon a deli∣berate
perusal of them I find
the Phrase and Language in
many places less ornate, and
in some scarce congruous. But
my main aim having been to
render all things perspicuous
and intelligible (which I hope
I have in some measure effe∣cted)
I was less attentive to
Grammatical and Euphonical
niceties. The <HI>Catalogue</HI> I
<PB REF="4"/>
have had already some years
by me, deferring the publica∣tion
thereof, because I still
entertain'd some thoughts of
making another Voyage beyond
the Seas; and then I doubt
not but I should have augmen∣ted
it by the addition of ma∣ny
Plants, with their Virtues
and uses. But now the Death
of Friends and other Adversi∣ties
that have lately befallen
me besides my Age having cut
off my hopes, and well quali∣fied,
not to say quite extin∣guished
my desires of further
Travelling, I have ventured
it abroad as it is, and submit
it to the censure of the Ju∣dicious
and Candid Reader.
If either <HI>Catalogue</HI> or <HI>Ob∣servations</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
prove any ways use∣ful
to the Public, by afford∣ing
matter of Information, or
if nothing else innocent Di∣version
to those that abound
with leisure, and might per∣haps
bestow their time worse,
I have what I desire, and as
much as I can reasonably ex∣pect.</P>
<P>But to detein you no lon∣ger,
I am not so ignorant of
my own Abilities, or so well
conceited of any Composition
or Performance of mine, as
to think I shall do you any
Honour by this Dedication;
I rather hope your Name
prefixed will gain Reputation
to my Book and procure it
acceptance in the World. Be

my intention before intimated,

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen I had Travelled
over the greatest part
of <HI>England</HI> in search
of Plants, and suf∣ficiently
informed
my self what sorts
my own Countrey naturally pro∣duced;
I grew desirous to see what
Varieties Foreign Countries of a dif∣ferent
Soil and Temperature of Air
might afford. For which reason I
was easily induced to accompany
<HI>Francis Willughby</HI> Esquire, <HI>Philip Skip∣pon</HI>
Esquire and <HI>Nathanael Bacon</HI> Gent.
in a Voyage beyond the Seas. The
success whereof, as to the number
of Plants found, exceeding my ex∣pectation
(notwithstanding the short∣ness
of our stay in most places gave
<PB REF="6"/>
me not leave to make an exact scru∣tiny)
I thought it might not be a∣miss
for the satisfaction of the curi∣ous,
and direction of those who may
heerafter travel the same places with
like design, to publish a Catalogue
of all not native of <HI>England</HI> that I
had observed. But considering the
paucity of those who delight in stu∣dies
and enquiries of this nature, to
advantage the Catalogue I have ad∣ded
thereto a brief Narrative of our
whole Voyage, with some <HI>Observati∣ons
Topographical, Moral and Natural,</HI>
made by my self and the foremen∣tioned
Gentlemen. I shall say no∣thing
to recommend them, but only
that what I write as of mine own
knowledge is punctually and in all
circumstances true, at least accord∣ing
to my apprehension and judg∣ment,
I not giving my self that li∣berty
which many Travellers are wont
to take, and the common Proverb
seems to allow them. And for what
I write from the Relation of
<PB REF="6"/>
others, though I will not warrant it
for certain, yet to me it seemed most
likely and probable. What Birds,
Beasts, Fishes and Insects I observed
abroad, whether common to us in
<HI>England,</HI> or peculiar to other Coun∣tries,
I have forborn to set down, be∣cause
the taking notice and descri∣bing
of them was the particular de∣sign
and business of that excellent
person Mr. <HI>Francis Willughby</HI> lately
deceased; and he having prepared store
of materials for a <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Animals,</HI>
and likewise digested them into a con∣venient
method, that work (if God
grant leisure and ability to bring it to
due perfection) is intended to be made
public, and the Reader may there find
what is heer omitted.</P>
<P>I might have been more large
concerning <HI>France</HI> but that we were
frustrated in our design of making
<HI>Grand tour</HI> (as they there call it) being
driven out thence by the <HI>Fr. Kings</HI>
Declaration, commanding all the
<HI>English</HI> to withdraw themselves and
<PB REF="7"/>
their effects out of his Dominions
within two months time. And yet
that Country being near us, much
travelled by and well known to those
of our Nation, and there being many
Itineraries and Descriptions of it ex∣tant
in Print, I thought it less needful
to write much concerning it.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Spain,</HI> it being a Countrey
out of the ordinary road of Travel∣lers,
and those that have viewed it
gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng others little encouragement to
follow their example, but rather con∣demning
themselves for their curiosi∣ty,
as having found nothing there
which might answer their trouble
and expence, that the Reader may
know something of it without the
hazard and charge of travelling it, I
have added by way of <HI>Appendix</HI> a short
account of Mr. <HI>Francis Willughby</HI>'s
Voyage through a great part of it,
collected out of his notes; which had
he himself published he would doubt∣less
have enriched with more Observa∣tions,
and cloathed with better Lan∣guage.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
Now whereas in the <HI>Narrative,</HI>
discoursing concerning the petrifica∣tion
of Shells, Fish-bones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I
have delivered as my opinion or con∣jecture,
that those bodies, which are
commonly known in <HI>England</HI> by the
names of <HI>Star-Stones</HI> and <HI>S. Cutberts
Beads,</HI> were nothing else but the spines
and tail-bones of some Fishes, I must
own my self to have been therein mi∣staken.
For my learned and ingeni∣ous
Friend Mr. <HI>Martin Lister</HI> hath
lately advised me, that he hath found
of them ramose and branched like
trees: which doth sufficiently evince
they were not of that original I sup∣posed.
Wherefore unless we will grant
them to be primary and immediate
productions of Nature, as they are
in the form of stones; we must em∣brace
Mr. <HI>Hook</HI>'s opinion, that they
were the roots of some Plants;
though I confess I never as yet saw any
Roots or Branches shaped and joynted
in that manner. Possibly there may
be or have been such kind of subma∣rine
<PB REF="8"/>
Plants or Roots which have hi∣therto
escaped my knowledge. For
that the parts not only of Trees but al∣so
of Herbs themselves may some∣times
petrifie, the stalks of <HI>Equisetum</HI>
which we gathered up on the banks
of the River <HI>Tanaro</HI> in <HI>Piemont</HI> do a∣bundantly
convince and satisfie me.
And this is all that I thought needful
to acquaint the Reader with by way of
Preface.</P>

Through
Part of the Low-Countries, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>pril</HI> 18, 1663. We passed over in
the Packet-Boat from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Ca∣lais,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Calais.</NOTE>
a Town formerly held by the
<HI>English</HI> about 210 years, <HI>viz.</HI> from
the 21. of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third,
when it was taken, till the last year
of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> when it was lost. Since that time,
<HI>Anno</HI> 1596. it was taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> under
Arch-Duke <HI>Albert</HI> in three days time, only the
Castle held out seven or eight. And last of all, <HI>Anno</HI>
1598. it was restored to the <HI>French</HI> upon the Trea∣ty
at <HI>Vervin,</HI> who now hold it. It is advantage∣ously
situate for Defence, and now very strongly
fortified after the modern fashion with an impene∣trable
Wall and Bastions of Earth, a deep Trench
full of Water to the landward, and a large Citadel.
The new Wall and Citadel were built about 44
years since. The old Stone-Wall and Ditch are still
remaining, but enclosed within the new. The Town
for bigness exceeds <HI>Dover,</HI> and seem'd to us frequent
and full of People. It hath a large square <HI>Piazza</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Market-Place, wherein are two great Markets
<PB REF="10"/>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
the convenience of its Harbour, which is of good
Capacity, safe from Winds, well defended, and
deep enough to receive Ships of great Burthen.
The Buildings of the Town are not tall, but hand∣som
and uniform; the Streets regular, well paved,
exactly level and streight. And it is no wonder
they should be so, the present Town having been
contrived and set out all at once. For when it was
surrendred up to Arch-Duke <HI>Albert</HI> after that famous
Siege of three years, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> found nothing
there but great Heaps of Earth and Rubbish, scarce,
one House of the old Building remaining. This
Town is most regularly and exactly fortified, so that
it seemed to us one of the strongest Pieces in all the
<HI>Low-Countries.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth by some esteemed the fifth Port Town
of <HI>Flanders</HI> which hath the largest and most capa∣cious
Harbour of all the rest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sluys.</NOTE> <HI>viz. Sluys,</HI> subject

not.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 24. We took places in the Passage-Boat
for <HI>Bruges,</HI> and at a League and halfs end came to
a Lock or Sluce, where we shifted our Boat. These
Locks or <HI>Sostegni</HI> (as the <HI>Italians</HI> significantly call
them) are usually placed at a great Declivity of any
Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el or Fall of water, and serve to sustain or keep
up the Water, (as the <HI>Italian</HI> Name imports) to make
a River navigable which either wants Water or hath
too s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eep a Descent. There are of them in <HI>England</HI>
(as we have been informed) upon <HI>Guildford</HI> River
in <HI>Surrey,</HI> and have been formerly upon the <HI>Trent.</HI>
They are usually thus contrived, First, there are
placed a pair of Folding-doors or Flood-gates cross
the Chanel to stop the water descending: Then, a
competent space being left to receive Boats and
Lighters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> another single Gate: In each of these
Gates, toward the bottom, is made a Hole or Win∣dow
sitted with a convenient Shut or Wicket (<HI>Por∣tello</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
the <HI>Italians</HI> call it) to open and shut as occasion
requires. When a Vessel comes down stream to the
<HI>Sostegno,</HI> first they open the <HI>Portello</HI> of the foremost
Gates and let the Water into the inclosed space,
which will necessarily rise there till it come to be
equal with the Level of that above the Gates; then
they shut the <HI>Portello,</HI> and the Stream making no re∣sistance,
easily draw back the Gates, and receive in
the Boat. Which done, they open the <HI>Portello</HI> of the
lower Gates, whereupon the Stream above presently
drives to and keeps fast the foremost Gates, and
the Water in the enclosed space sinks till it be even
with that in the Chanel below; and then they open
the Gate itself and let the Boat out. When a Boat
goes up Stream, they first open the lowermost Gate,
and receive it into the middle or enclosed space,
then withdraw or set open the <HI>Portello</HI> in the upper∣most
Gates, letting in the water till it come to be
equal with the level of that above the Gates, and
lastly draw back the Gates themselves and let out
the Boat. <HI>N. B.</HI> That both upper and lower Gates
open against the Stream, and are driven to and kept
shut by it, and that the Leaves of the upper Gates
lie not in the same plain when shut, but make an
obtuse Angle, the better to resist the force of the
Water.</P>

manner of raising up Water for the use of the Ci∣tizens
by a Chain whereon are fastned Cylindrical
Iron Buckets. This Chain is round in form of a
Bracelet, Neck-lace or Wheel-band, and put over
a large <HI>Axis</HI> deeply furrowed, from which it hangs
down into a Well of Water, and being turned about
by the <HI>Axis,</HI> the descending Buckets have their
mouths downward, and take up Water as they pass
through the Well; which (ascending with their
mouths upward, but a little inclining from the
Chain outward) they bring up to the <HI>Axis,</HI> to which
so soon as they are come, by reason of their Posi∣tion
they must needs turn it out into a Trough pla∣ced
under the <HI>Axis,</HI> by which it is conveyed to a
Cistern, and thence by Pipes to private Houses.
This kind of Machin is generally used in <HI>Italy,
Spain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> for raising up Water, to water
their Gardens in Summer time. The deep Furrows
in the <HI>Axis</HI> are to catch hold of the Buckets, that the
Chain slip not back by reason of the weight of the
ascending Buckets. In this City are no more than
seven Parish Churches, but of Monasteries or Reli∣gious
Houses (as they call them) good store, 60 ac∣cording
to <HI>Golnitz.</HI> In the Church of <HI>Nostre-dame</HI>
or S. <HI>Mary</HI> lies the Body of <HI>Charles</HI> the Hardy, Duke
of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and Lord of most of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI>
under a stately Monument with a <HI>French</HI> Inscription
upon it, which tells us, that he was slain in the Battel
of <HI>Nancy,</HI> 1476. and his Body brought from <HI>Nancy</HI>
hither by his great Grand-child <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth,
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
Emperour, and that K. <HI>Philip</HI> the Second erected
to him that Monument. We saw in this Town one
<HI>John Tates,</HI> a Man of a Gigantick Stature, born at
<HI>Schoonhoven</HI> in <HI>Holland:</HI> one of a middle Stature
might well stand under his arm-pit, from his middle
fingers end to his elbow was 25 inches and a half, the
length of his hand to his wrist 11 inches, his middle
finger 7 inches. He was well shaped, and all his
Limbs proportionable to his height. He was afterwards
(as we heard) brought over into <HI>England</HI> to be
shown.</P>
<P>Near this City (as <HI>Boetius de Boot,</HI> who was Na∣tive
thereof relates) digging ten or twenty Ells deep
in the Earth, they find whole Woods of Trees, in
which the Trunks, Boughs and Leaves do so exact∣ly
appear, that one may easily distinguish the seve∣ral
kinds of them, and very plainly discern the Se∣ries
of Leaves which have fallen yearly. These sub∣terraneous
Woods are found in those places which
500 years ago were Sea, and afterwards either left
and thrown up by the Sea, or gained from it, the
Tides being kept off by Walls and Fences. But be∣fore
the fore-mentioned term of 500 years, there
is no memory that these places were part of the
Continent. And yet seeing the tops of these Trees
do for the most part lie Eastward, because (as is pro∣bable)
they were thrown down by Western Winds,
which on this Coast are most boisterous and violent,
it will necessarily follow that in the most antient
times and before all memory of man, these places
were Firm Land, and without the limits of the
Sea.</P>
<P>The Describer of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> tells us, that in
<HI>Friesfland</HI> and <HI>Groningland,</HI> there are great numbers
of these under-ground Trees found and digged up
in Mosses and fenny Grounds where they dig for
Turves. In <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gland</HI> also there are found of them
plentifully in many places, the Wood whereof
<PB N="7" REF="13" MS="y"/>
they usually call <HI>Moss-Wood,</HI> because it is for the
most part digged up in the Mosses or moorish boggy
Fens and Levels where they get Turves; though
sometimes it be found in firmer Grounds, and some∣times
in the sides of Mountains. The Question is,
How these Trees came to be buried so deep under
ground? To which we may probably answer, that
many Ages ago before all Records of Antiquity, yea
before primitive Fame or Tradition itself, these
places were part of the firm Land, and covered
with Wood; afterwards being undermined and
overwhelmed by the violence of the Sea, they con∣tinued
so long under water, till the Rivers brought
down Earth and Mud enough to cover the Trees,
fill up these Shallows, and restore them to the firm
Land again. In like manner upon the Coast of
<HI>Suffolk</HI> about <HI>Dunwich,</HI> the Sea doth now and hath
for many years past very much encroached upon the
Land, undermining and overwhelming by degrees
a great deal of high ground; insomuch that anti∣ent
Writings make mention of a Wood a mile and
half to the East of <HI>Dunwich,</HI> which is at present so
far within the Sea. Now if in succeeding Ages (as
likely enough it is) the Sea shall by degrees be filled
up, either by its own working, or by Earth brought
down by Land-Floods still subsiding to the bottom,
and growing up over the tops of these Trees, and so
this space again added to the firm Land; the men that
shall then live in those parts (if the World so long last)
will, it's likely, dig up these Trees, and as much won∣der
how they came there, as we do at the present
Moss-Wood.</P>
<P>And now that I am speaking of filling up and
atterrating (to borrow that word of the <HI>Italians</HI>) the
Skirts and Borders of the Sea, I shall take leave to
add by the by, that to me it seems very probable,
that all the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> have been in this manner
gained from the Sea. For <HI>Varenius</HI> in his Geography
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
tells us, That sinking Well in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> at near
an hundred foot depth they met with a Bed or Floor
of Sand and Cockle-shells, whence it is evident that
of old time the bottom of the Sea lay so deep, and
that that hundred foot thickness of Faith above the
Sand arose from the Sediments of the Waters of
those great Rivers, which there emptied themselves
into the Sea, and in times of Floods brought down
with them abundance of Earth from the upper
Grounds: Which yet is a strange thing, consider∣ing
the novity of the World, the Age whereof ac∣cording
to the usual Account is not yet 5600 years.
That the Rain doth continually wash down Earth
from the Mountains, and atterrate or add part of
the Sea to the firm Land, is manifest from the <HI>La∣gune</HI>
or Flats about <HI>Venice;</HI> the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amdrg</HI> or Isle of the
River <HI>Rhosue</HI> about <HI>Aix</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> in which we
were told that the Watch-Tower had in the memory
of some men been removed forward three times, so
much had been there gained from the Sea; and many
places in our own Land: only it is a received Traditi∣on,
and may perhaps be true, that what the Sea loses in
one place, it gets in another. That the height of the
Mountains, at least those which consist not of firm
rocks, doth continually diminish, is I think very likely,
not to say certain. I have been credibly informed, that
whereas the Steeple of <HI>Craich</HI> in the <HI>Peak of Derby∣shire</HI>
in the memory of some old men yet living
could not have been seen from a certain Hill lying
between <HI>Hopton</HI> and <HI>Wirksworth,</HI> now not only
the Steeple, but a great part of the Body of the
Church may from thence be seen: Which without
doubt comes to pass by the sinking of a Hill between
the Church and place of View. Hence it would fol∣low,
that in process, of time (but it would be many
thousands of years first) all the Hills and Mountains
(except the rocky) would by Floods and Shots of
Rain be quite washed away and the whole Earth le∣velled.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="14"/>
But to return to the Trees: One material Excep∣tion
against our Solution still remains, and that is,
that a great many of these subterraneous Trees dig'd
up in <HI>England</HI> are thought to be Firs, whereas that
kind of Tree doth not at present, and consequently
we have reason to believe never did, grow wild
in this Kingdom. To which I answer, that this
Exception would indeed much puzzle me, were
it certain and manifest, that this is Fir-Wood,
which is so generally reputed from its Grain, In∣flammability
and other Qualities. But since it doth
not clearly appear to me so to be, I shall re∣spite
my Answer, till I be fully satisfied concerning
it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bruges, April</HI> 27. We went be Boat to
<HI>Gau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gaunt.</NOTE> the greatest City of <HI>Flanders;</HI> whence the
Emperour <HI>Charles V.</HI> who was born here, was
wont to boast, that he could put <HI>Paris</HI> into his
<HI>Gane;</HI> in which word there is an Equivoque, <HI>Gane</HI>
in <HI>French</HI> signifying a Glove. Yet is the Wall too
great for the Buildings, enclosing much void ground.
In this City as in <HI>Bruges,</HI> are 7 Parish Churches,
and according to <HI>Golu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x,</HI> about 55 Religious Hou∣ses.
We ascended the Tower called <HI>Bellefort</HI> about
four hundred Steps high, and saw the famous Bell
call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Roland,</HI> not so great as we imagined. This
City is well built, well wall'd and trench'd about,
and the Inhabitants to us seemed very bus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and in∣dustrious.</P>
<P>From <HI>Gaunt, April</HI> 30. we travelled to <HI>Brussels,</HI>
about thirty <HI>English</HI> Miles distant, passing through
<HI>Aolst,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aolst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> a fortified Town of some note.</P>
<P><HI>Brussels</HI> is the capital City of <HI>Brabant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brussels.</NOTE> where the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Governour of these Provinces, who was
then the Marquess of <HI>Caracene,</HI> usually resides. It
is well built, large and populous. The Streets are
broad; the Stadt-house a fair and uniform Build∣ing.
The Common People here, and also at <HI>Ant∣werp,
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
Lovain, Mechlin,</HI> and other Cities of <HI>Brabant,</HI>
(as hath been noted by others) make use of Dogs
to draw little Carts and Wheel-Barrows laden with
Commodities about the Streets. But for the Ad∣vantage
they make of them, setting aside the main∣taining
of an old Custom, I think they might as
well employ their own Arms and Shoulders. In
the Gallery by the Riding -place, is an Echo, which
reflects the Voice fifteen times as we were assured:
We observed about ten distinct Reflections, the
Wind hindering us as to the rest. At this time it
happened <HI>Ludovicus de Bills</HI> to be in Town, whom
we visited and saw five Bodies which he had with
him, embalmed and preserved after his newly
invented manner, entire with all their Entrails and
Bowels. He was then going to the University of
<HI>Lovain,</HI> with whom he had made an agreement for
Discovery of his Art and reading publick Anatomy
Lectures.</P>
<P>Our next remove (<HI>May</HI> 2.) was to <HI>Lovain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lovain.</NOTE> a
large City, but neither well built nor well kept,
only the Stadt-house is a stately Structure, and
makes a fair show at a distance. The Wall is of
great extent, more in Circuit than that of <HI>Gannt</HI>
by three Rods, taking in much void ground. The
Colleges are in number 43, the Names whereof to∣gether
with their Founders are exhibited in the en∣suing
Catalogue which we there found published in

The several Faculties are distinguished by their
Habits: Divinity-Students wear constantly Gowns
and square Caps; those of other Faculties wear
none, except at their publick Exercises in the Schools.
The principal Colleges, called <HI>Pedagogies,</HI> are four.
In these only is Philosophy taught by two Profes∣sors,
the one called <HI>Primarius,</HI> the other <HI>Secunda∣rius.</HI>
Those Students that are Gentlemen sit in a
higher Form, called <HI>Scamnum Nobilium;</HI> and give
each of them six Gilders quarterly to the <HI>Primarius</HI>
Professor, and two Patacoons to the <HI>Secundarius.</HI>
Those of inseriour rank who sit in the lower Forms
give half so much to each. The <HI>Primarius</HI> reads in
the morning from half an hour after six of the clock
till half an hour after seven, then they go to Mass
till eight, and after that to their private Studies
till ten, then the Professor reads again till eleven.
In the afternoon the <HI>Secundarius</HI> Professor reads
from half an hour after one, till half an hour after
two. He begins again half an hour after four and
reads till half an hour after five. All Students must
write after the Professors in a large Note-Book, and
in the intervals of Lectures peruse and study what
they wrote. The Professors Readings are divided into
<HI>Dictata,</HI> which are Theses or Propositions, and <HI>An∣notata</HI>
which are Solutions of Objections. The first
thing they require of Students when they come to this
University is to be matriculated, and swear their Be∣lief
of all the Doctrines of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church. The
Close or End of the Oath is the same with that of
our Universities, <HI>Ita me Deus adjuvet &amp; haec sancta Dei
Evangelia.</HI></P>
<P>Young Students give their Names to the Presi∣dent
of their College or Pedagogy, and for every
time they are absent from Lectures are punished
a Stiver, which is somewhat more than a Penny
<HI>English.</HI> For every time they miss a publick
Exercise in Law or Physick they pay three Sti∣vers;
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
if they be to exercise themselves and miss,
they are mulcted twenty Stivers. The Students
are not allowed to wear Swords about the
Streets.</P>
<P>The Professors of each Pedagogy chuse yearly 12
of the best Scholars who are of two years stand∣ing.
These 48 are publickly examined, and out of
them about 12 usually chosen to Burses or Exhibi∣tions.
The Burses signifie their Diet, Chamber
and a greater or less Stipend according as the Bur∣ses
are. It is very creditable to be chosen to a
Burse. He that is the first of the chosen hath a
Bell rung for him in his College 48 hours together
without intermission. When they are thus chosen,
they may go into what College they will and study
what they please. They are commonly preferred
to Professorships and afterwards to Canons Places.
The Degrees here conferred are <HI>Batchelour,</HI> Licen∣tiate
and <HI>Doctor.</HI> In <HI>Divinity</HI> after two years stand∣ing
they may be <HI>Baccalaurei ourrentes,</HI> after another
year <HI>Baccalaurei formati.</HI> Seven years after this
they may be <HI>Licentiates</HI> in Divinity. They are
seldom created <HI>Doctors</HI> till they attain to 50 years of
Age, unless they be very eminent for Learning.
Every <HI>Batchelor</HI> is called <HI>Doctissimus: A Licentiate</HI> in
Medicine <HI>Peritissimus,</HI> in Law <HI>Consultissimus,</HI> in Di∣vinity
<HI>Eximius: Doctors</HI> of Medicine and Law are
<HI>Clarissimi,</HI> of Divinity <HI>Eximii</HI> Domini &amp; <HI>Magistri nostri.</HI>
When any one goes out <HI>Licentiate,</HI> there is a Treat∣ment
made, to which all the Doctors and the Oppo∣nents
are invited, and have Gloves given them. The
Graduate is attended from the Schools with Drums
and Trumpets. At his Lodging a Bell is hung up
and rung for 24 hours together. He hath liberty to
chuse a Coat of Arms, and is immediately reputed a
Gentleman.</P>
<P>The men of most note for Learning in this Uni∣versity
at present [1663.] are <HI>Gutischovius, Medi∣cinae
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
&amp; Matheseos Professor. Vopiscus Fortunatus Plem∣pius,

Philosophy here, but is now turned Protestant,
and lives at <HI>Leyden: Van Verve, Theol. Professor
Prim trius.</HI> The publick Schools are old, mean and
homely.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 4. we walked out of <HI>Lovain</HI> about half a
mile to see the D. of <HI>Areschot</HI>'s Palace, and the <HI>Cele∣stines</HI>
Cloister adjoining. We found among the Corn
by the way-sides as we went, plentifully growing
<HI>Caryophyllus arvensis umbelliferus</HI> J. B. and <HI>Alsine foliis
hederaceis Rutae modo divisis</HI> Lob.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plauts a∣bout <HI>Lo∣vain.</HI></NOTE> both in flower.
At this City we first observed Storks, Women-Porters
and Soldiers begging on Horse-back.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lovain, May</HI> 5. we travelled to <HI>Mechlin,
Malines</HI> the <HI>French</HI> call it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mechlin.</NOTE> a very elegant and well-built
City, exceeding our expectation both for
Beauty and Greatness. It is the Seat of an Arch∣bishop,
and with a small Territory of nine Villa∣ges
about it makes one of the seventeen Provinces,
called the Lordship of <HI>Mechlin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> The Cathedral
Church is dedicated to <HI>S. Rumbald.</HI> Many Manu∣factures
exercised here of the most gainful sort,
as making of Linen Cloth, casting of great Artillery
and Bells; and which we especially took notice of,
Tanning, there being two or three whole Streets of
Tanners.</P>
<P>Hence <HI>May</HI> 5. we boated to <HI>Antwerp,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antwerp</NOTE> a City for
Strength and Beauty comparable to any of its big∣ness
in <HI>Europe.</HI> For the latter in my opinion, it
much excels <HI>Florence,</HI> with which it is wont to be
put in competition. And for the former, it is en∣compassed
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
with a Wall of Earth faced with Free∣stone,
of that thickness that there are several Rows
of Trees and broad Walks upon it; and with a
Ditch of water of a very great depth and breadth,
excepting on that side the River <HI>Scheld</HI> washes it.
So that, considering also the advantage of its Situ∣ation
in a low and level Countrey, it seemed to me
the strongest City in all the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> The Cita∣del
first built by the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> and afterward
repaired by the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> of a Pentagonal
Figure, serves as well to bridle as defend the Town.
The Houses of <HI>Antwerp</HI> are for the most part of
Brick, some few wooden ones of the antient Build∣ing
here and there remaining, which the Owners
are not suffered to repair. The Chappel of the
<HI>Jesuites</HI> College is very rich and sumptuous. The
Steeple of S. <HI>Maries</HI> Church is so curiously built and
carved, that the Emperour <HI>Charles V.</HI> (as we were
told) was wont to say, that it deserved to be kept
in a case and shewn only upon Holy-days. The
<HI>Exchange</HI> or <HI>Burse</HI> was the Pattern after which our
old <HI>Royal Exchange</HI> was built, but in all respects in∣feriour
to it, the Copy excelling the Original. The
<HI>Stadthouse</HI> is a magnificent Structure. Several
other publick Buildings there are that deserve to
be viewed, most of which are represented in the
adjoined Map. <HI>Plantius</HI> Printing-House, menti∣oned
by <HI>Golnitz</HI> and others, is for a thing of that
nature the best we have any where seen. This
City for Trading and Wealth is much decayed since
the <HI>Low-Countrey</HI> Wars. In the Garden of one
<HI>Franciscus van Steerbeck</HI> a Priest, we saw many rare
Plants: Among others we took more especial no∣tice

<P><HI>May</HI> 15. we took Boat for <HI>Middleburgh;</HI> at <HI>Lillo</HI>
a Fort upon the <HI>Scheld,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lillo.</NOTE> three Leagues below <HI>Ant∣werp,</HI>
belonging to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> our Boat
was searcht, as are all Vessels going to and from
<HI>Antwerp.</HI> The Wind and Tide favouring us,
we reach'd <HI>Middleburgh</HI> before Sun-set, having
made in all this day about 54 <HI>English</HI> miles. Up∣on
the Flats we passed over, at a good distance
from us, we saw several Sea-Calves upon the
Sands.</P>
<P><HI>Middleburgh</HI> is the capital City of <HI>Zealand,</HI> large,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Middle∣burgh.</NOTE>
well-built, having spatious Streets, populous, full
of wealthy Merchants, and well fortified, as are
generally all Cities and Towns of any account in
the United <HI>Netherlands.</HI> It is situate near the mid∣dle
of the Isle <HI>Walachria,</HI> whence no doubt it took
it's Name, and not from <HI>Metellus,</HI> quasi <HI>Metelli Bur∣gum,</HI>
as some have fondly imagined. From that
side the Island respecting <HI>Antwerp</HI> is an artificial
Chanel cut up to the Town, capable of Ships of
good burthen, which come into the Town, the
said Chanel passing through and making Havens in
three or four of the Streets. There are (as we
were informed) about twenty Churches of all sorts
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
in this City, the <HI>Lutherans, French, Anabaptists</HI> and
<HI>Jews</HI> being here tolerated and allowed places of
publick Worship. At the Stadthouse we observed
two Eagles kept, which we were told the Citizens
were obliged to by their Charter, by which they have
great Immunities granted them by the Emperour, as
Freedom from Arrests any where but in their own
City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 16.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flushing.</NOTE> we walked out to <HI>Flushing</HI> about two
miles and an half distant from <HI>Middleburgh;</HI> a
Town once cautionary to the <HI>English,</HI> though not
so large nor so well built as <HI>Middleburgh,</HI> and ha∣ving
narrow Streets, yet very considerable for its
Strength and Riches, the opportunity of its Situa∣tion
and conveniency of its Harbour, Ships of good
burthen coming up into several Streets of the Town
in artificial Chanels, and lying there secure from
Wind and Weather.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 19.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vere.</NOTE> we took another Walk to <HI>Vere,</HI> called
by the Dutch <HI>Ter-Vere</HI> or <HI>Camp-Vere,</HI> some three
miles distant from <HI>Middleburgh</HI> to the Northward;
a Town for bigness inferiour to <HI>Flushing,</HI> well for∣tified,
having two fair Harbours for Ships with
broad Wharfs or Keys within the Walls. We re∣turned
back through <HI>Armuyden,</HI> a small Town con∣sisting
of one Street, yet entrench'd about. Here
hath been formerly a good Trade driven. By the
way we observed the Sea-banks to be faced with a
kind of matting of Rushes or Flags staked down as
high as the Tide usually arises, to defend them
from being washed away by the Water.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 20.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bergen op Zome.</NOTE> we went by Boat from <HI>Middleburgh</HI> to
<HI>Bergen op Zome,</HI> passing by <HI>Rammekens,</HI> a strong Fort
at the Entrance of the Chanel leading to <HI>Middle∣burgh.
Bergen</HI> is a place of very great Strength, be∣sides
the Wall and Trench, being fortified with
Half Moons, Horn-Works, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> famous for the no∣table
Resistance it made first to the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>
and afterwards to the Marquess <HI>Spinola</HI> besieging
of it, <HI>Anno</HI> 1622, At our being there it was held
with a strong Garrison, consisting of twelve Com∣panies
of Foot, two whereof were <HI>English,</HI> and
two Troops of Horse, beside four Companies of
Townsmen.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 21. we travelled to <HI>Breda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Breda.</NOTE> eight hours distant
from <HI>Bergen,</HI> for so they reckon or measure their way
in these Countreys, by the time they spend in passing
it. This Town is considerable for its bigness, well
built and populous; of great Strength, being en∣compassed
with very thick Walls and Mounts of
Earth and two Trenches full of Water, the one
broad and deep: At our Entrance in we passed
through two Ports, and over five Draw-Bridges.
It belongs to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who hath a
Castle and a fair Palace in the Town. Here are
maintained in Garrison for defence of this impor∣tant
Strength thirteen Companies of Foot, two
whereof were <HI>English</HI> at our being there, and four
Troops of Horse. Ever since the Surprise of this
Town by the Truf-Boat, it is the Custom to search
all Boats laden with Commodities that enter here
by stabbing them through in sundry places with a
Spit.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 22. we travelled from <HI>Breda</HI> first to S. <HI>Ger∣trudenberg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Gertru∣denberg.</NOTE>
belonging to the States, no great Town,
but well fortified and entrencht, garrison'd by three
Companies of Foot, one whereof was <HI>English,</HI> and
a Troop of Horse: and from <HI>Gertrudenberg</HI> the
same day by water to <HI>Dordrecht</HI> or <HI>Dort,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dort.</NOTE> a large
City, very rich and populous, well built with tall
Houses of Brick, not inferiour to those of <HI>Antwerp.</HI>
The Streets elegantly paved, in the middle with
Stone, and on each side next the houses with Brick
set edgeways, so clean that a man may walk them
in Slippers without wetting his foot in the midst
of Winter. Thus paved and thus cleanly kept are
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
the Streets of all the Cities and great Towns in
<HI>Holland.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> Merchants have great Privi∣leges,
and keep their Court in this Town. Here
are two <HI>English</HI> Churches and one <HI>French.</HI> From
the Tower of the principal Church we had a fair
Prospect of the City and Countrey adjacent, the
Steeple of <HI>Breda</HI> coming into view. In one of the
upper Rooms of the Gunners Doel or Guild sate the
Synod assembled here, <HI>Anno</HI> 1611. The Seats round
about are still remaining.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 23. we took places in one of the Passage-Boats
that go off several times daily to <HI>Roterdam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Roter∣dam.</NOTE>
some three Leagues distant from <HI>Dort,</HI> which
brought us thither in five hours. <HI>Roterdam</HI> is of a
triangular Figure, and much larger than I thought
it to have been. It equals if not exceeds any City
in <HI>Holland</HI> except <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and perhaps <HI>Leyden.</HI>
It hath been lately much augmented by the addi∣tion
of many Streets of new buildings. Near the
principal Church dedicated to S. <HI>Laurence</HI> is a little
House where <HI>Erasmus</HI> was born, over the door of
which is placed his Picture, and on one side of that
this Distich written,
<Q><L>Aedibus his ortus mundum decoravit Erasmus</L>
<L>Artibus ingenuis, relligione, fide.</L></Q>
Under it in <HI>Spanish</HI> this,
<Q><L>En esta casa es nacido Erasmo Theologo celebrado,</L>
<L>Par doctrina sennalado, la pura fee nos a revelado.</L></Q>
And in <HI>Latin</HI> this,
<Q><L>Fatalis series nobis invidit Erasmum,</L>
<L>At Desiderium tollere non potuit.</L></Q></P>
<P>In a large <HI>Piazza</HI> stands a stately Brass Statue
erected to his Memory, with the Figure of a Book
<PB N="25" REF="22"/>
of the same Metal in its hand, and in the posture of
turning over a Leaf, of which in drollery the
People say, that every time it hears the Clock strike,
it turneth over a Leaf. The Citizens of <HI>Roterdam</HI>
exercise no Handicraft or Manufacture to trade
withal, but all their Riches proceed from their Sea-Trade
and Merchandise. They have a very good
Port, Ships of great Burthen coming up in deep
Chanels into the very Town: where they lie se∣cure
from all danger, and lade and unlade their
Commodities at the Merchants doors. The Go∣vernment
is by a President, four Burgomasters,
and twenty four Magistrates or Senators, which
they call the <HI>Vroetschap.</HI> These chuse all publick
Officers out of their own number. Themselves
continue in place during life, and when any one
dies, the rest chuse out of the Citizens another into
his room. So that the People have no interest or
share at all in the Government. The form of Go∣vernment
is most what the same in all the other
Cities and Towns of <HI>Holland,</HI> only the number of
Counsellours or the <HI>Vroetschap</HI> is in some more, in
some less.</P>
<P>Every hour of the day at the ringing of a Bell
goes off a Passage-Boat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Delft.</NOTE> somewhat like our Pleasure-Barges
on the <HI>Thames,</HI> to <HI>Delft.</HI> We took places
in one of these, <HI>May</HI> 25. which in two hours time
brought us to <HI>Delft,</HI> three <HI>Dutch</HI> miles. This is
also a large City, fair and well-built, water runs
through many of the Streets. The Stadthouse is
a very handsom Structure. Here are two large
Churches, the one called the old, the other the
new Kirk. In the middle of the Quire of the
new Kirk is a stately Monument erected to the
Memory of Grave <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> Prince of

<P>Adjoining to the School-Yard is the <HI>Physick∣Garden,</HI>
a Square of less than an Acre of Ground,
but well stored with Plants, of which there have
been at sundry times several Catalogues printed.
Here are no Colleges for Students to live in, as in
our Universities, (excepting two of the nature of
Hospitals for the maintenance only of poor Scho∣lar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>)
but the Students live in private Lodgings in
<PB N="36" REF="28"/>
the Town, where they can best provide themselves.
No Scholastical Habits as Gowns or Caps worn by
any of the Students, but they walk up and down,
come to the Schools, and perform their Exercises
in Cloaks. The Professors when they read Lectures
or preside at Disputations wear Gowns. No cap∣ping
Professors or University-Officers in the publick
Schools, but all the Students are covered both at
Lectures and Disputations, not only in the Uni∣versity,
but in all the Universities we have been at
beyond the Seas. If an desire to be admitted of
the University, they go to the <HI>Rector magnificus,</HI> who
gives them each a Seal, and then they are freed
from paying Exeise. The Students usually list
themselves under some Professor, who reads to
them in private, running through a whole Faculty,
which they call <HI>Collegium instituere,</HI> and for this they
give a Gratuity to the Professor. In conferring
Degrees here is no Respect had to Standing.
When any one intends to commence in any Faculty,
he makes <HI>Theses</HI> upon the Subject he intends to an∣swer,
which <HI>Theses</HI> are printed, and these he is obli∣ged
to defend against all Opponents. The Respon∣dent
hath his Seat under the Prosessors, as in our
Schools: for the Opponents there is no particular
Seat, but in any part of the Schools where they
happen to be, they arise and there stand and oppose,
first asking leave of the Professor that presides at
the Act. Any one that pleases may oppose with
the Professors leave. <HI>Liberalium Artium Magister</HI>
and Doctor are the only Degrees conferred here.
Each of the Professors have 200 or 300 <HI>l. per an.</HI>
stipend allowed them by the States.</P>
<P>The chief Trade of this City is Clothing. The
Roofs of the Houses are more steep than ordi∣nary,
made so on purpose to cast the Rain-Water
into a Chanel or Trough, which conveys it into a
large Cistern, where it is kept for the uses of the
<PB N="37" REF="28"/>
House. Great Chanels of Water pass through ma∣ny
of the Streets. On the Tower of the Stadt∣house
stands a Watchman, who blows a Trumpet
every hour, and if any Fire happens he sounds an
Alarm. Below stands a Guard of thirty armed
Soldiers, and at each Port ten. Every hour of the
night a man goes about the Streets, and making a
noise with a Rapper, tells with a loud voice what
of the Clock it is. In the Anatomical Theater are
preserved many Sceletons of Men and Beasts, Skins
of Beasts, parts of exotic Animals, and other Ra∣rities.
We noted a horned Beetle from the <HI>East-Indies;</HI>

<P>Before we left <HI>Leyden</HI> we made a by-Journey to
<HI>Sevenhuys,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven∣huys.</NOTE> a Village about four leagues distant, to
see a remarkable Grove, where in time of year se∣veral
sorts of Wild-Fowl build and breed. We ob∣served
there in great numbers (1.) <HI>Scholfers</HI> i. e.
<HI>Gracculi palmipedes,</HI> in <HI>England</HI> we call them <HI>Shags,</HI>
they are very like to Cormorants, only less. We
were much surprised to see them, being a whole-footed
Bird, alight and build upon Trees. (2.) <HI>Le∣pelaers,</HI>
called by <HI>Gesner Plateoe sive Pelecani,</HI> by <HI>Al∣drovandus
Albardeolae,</HI> we may term them in <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Spoon-Bills. (3.) <HI>Quacks</HI> or <HI>Ardeae cinereae
minores,</HI> the <HI>Germans</HI> call this Bird the <HI>Night-raven,</HI>
because it makes a noise in the Night, <HI>Nocte cla∣mat
voce absonâ &amp; tanquam vomiturientis.</HI> Gesner.
(4.) <HI>Reyers</HI> or Herons. Each sort of Fowl hath its
several Quarter. When the young are ripe, they
who farm the Grove with an Iron Hook fastned to
the end of a long Pole lay hold on the Bough on
which the Nest is built, aud shake the young ones
out, and sometimes Nest and all down to the ground.
Besides the fore-mentioned Birds there build also in
this Wood <HI>Ravens, Wood-Pigeons</HI> and <HI>Turtle-Doves.</HI>
This place is rented for 3000 Gilders <HI>per Annum</HI> of
the Baron of <HI>Pelemberg,</HI> who lives at <HI>Lovain,</HI> only
for the Birds and Grass. By the way to this Place
we observed in the Ditches <HI>Lysimachia lutea flore glo∣boso,</HI>
and <HI>Arum sive Dracunculus aquaticus.</HI> All the
Countrey about <HI>Sevenhuys</HI> towards <HI>Leyden</HI> is a flat
or fenny Level, full of shallow Pools of Water;
there we observed their manner of making Turf.
They rake or fish up Mud from the bottom of the
Water with a Net like a Hoop-Net fastned to the
end of a Pole, and fill therewith a flat-bottomed
Boat. Out of the Boat they throw this Mud with
<PB N="39" REF="29"/>
a long Shovel or Scoop on an even piece of ground,
making of it a Bed of an equal thickness so near as
they can; there it lies to drain and dry: After a
while they tread it with broad Boards fastned under
their feet to make it close and smooth. When it
is moderately dry, they cut the whole Bed with a
kind of Spade into pieces of the bigness of a Brick.
These they pile up in small conical Stacks or long
Ranks, laying the Turves so, that a man may see
through the Stacks, and the Wind blow through
them, to be further dried. At last they house them
in Barns that are thatcht, the sides not walled up
close, but made of wooden Bars set at a little distance
one from another.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 6. we took Boat for <HI>Haerlem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Haerlem.</NOTE> where we
arrived at four hours end. This is a large, popu∣lous
and pleasant City, strongly wall'd and entren∣ched.
Water is brought through many of the
Streets. Without the Walls towards <HI>Leyden</HI> are
pleasant Groves. In the Summer-House in the
Garden of the Princes Court here, is a Picture of
<HI>Laurentius Costerus,</HI> in a furr'd Gown, holding the
Letter A in his Hand, and this Inscription over
it,
<Q><HI>M. S. Viro Consulari,</HI> Laurentio Costero <HI>Harle∣mensi
alteri Cadmo, &amp; Artis Typographicae circa
Annum Domini</HI> MCCCCXXXX <HI>Inventori pri∣mo.</HI></Q></P>
<P>His Statue and the Inscription on his House in
the Market-place, mentioned by <HI>Hegenitius,</HI> we
could not find, being as we were told, lately bought
and removed thence. The Butchery of this Town
is a handsome Building and covered with Lead,
which we thought not unworthy the notice-taking,
it having been the first publick Building that we saw
so rooft since we left <HI>England.</HI> The Citizens here
drive a great Trade of Weaving as well Silks, <HI>v. g.</HI>
Damask, Velvet, Sattin, Taffaty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as Linen
<PB N="40" REF="30"/>
Cloth, Tiffany, Holland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> On the Sea-Coast
near <HI>Haerlem</HI> and all along <HI>North-Holland,</HI> are great
sandy Hills or Downs, which are a great defence to
the Countrey hereabout against the Encroachments
of the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 8. From <HI>Haerlem</HI> we boated to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amster∣dam.</NOTE>
two hours distant.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> About the mid-way we passed
by two great Mears where we changed our Boat.
At the Port of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> stand two armed Sol∣diers,
one within, the other without. This is the
greatest City in all the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and one of
the richest and best traded Empories of the whole
World. At our being there we judged it to be
about the bigness of <HI>Venice,</HI> and lesser than one half
of <HI>London;</HI> but they had then taken in and enclo∣sed
with a substantial Wall and Trench, a great
space of Ground, wherein they had designed and
set out Streets, with intention to make their City
for bigness also comparable with the best of <HI>Europe,
London</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> not excepted. I hear since, that
this void Ground is filled with Rows of stately and
beautiful Houses. The publick Buildings we espe∣cially
took notice of were, (1.) The <HI>New Stadthouse</HI>
lately erected, the old one having been burnt down
to the Ground in three hours space (as we were
told) <HI>June</HI> 7, 1651. but (as I find it in the Printed
Description of <HI>Amsterdam</HI>) in <HI>July</HI> 1652. This is
a magnificent Pile of Building, of a square figure,
large and tall. The Outside or Facing of the Walls
round about is of Free-Stone, the body of the
Walls of Brick. It is reported, that the Foundati∣on
of this Structure under ground cost as much as
the <HI>Superficies</HI> above ground, <HI>viz.</HI> 100000 <HI>l.</HI> sterling.
The Describer of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> saith, that it standeth

Building with fair Rooms. (4.) The <HI>Maga∣zine,</HI>

Correction. In this City is an <HI>Athenaeum</HI> or <HI>Schola

who read publick Lectures in several Faculties in
Summer-time. Here is also a publick <HI>Physick-Garden.</HI>
The <HI>Jews</HI> are here allowed the free and open Exer∣cise
of their Religious Worship. They live together
in one Quarter of the City, and are said to be in
number about 20000 souls. They are in better
condition and richer than in most places where they
are tolerated. They are for the most part of a dark
or tawny Complexion and have black hair. Not
only the <HI>Jewish</HI> but all other Religions, the <HI>Romish</HI>
not excepted, are here tolerated. But if any beside
those of the State-Religion build Churches, they
are prohibited to erect Steeples, or make use of
Bells for the assembling of the Pople. In the new
Church is a handsome Monument to <HI>John van Galen,</HI>

<P>In this Church is a stately Pulpit said to have cost
1000 <HI>l.</HI> sterling the building. We were told that
in this City there were 24 Ministers pensioned by
the States.</P>
<P>The Government is by a Scout or Praetor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernment of <HI>Amster∣dam.</HI></NOTE> four
Burgomasters, nine and Scabins, and 36 Counsellors, or
Senators, which they call the <HI>Vroetschap.</HI> The <HI>Scout</HI>
is Stadtholder of <HI>Holland,</HI> ad hath the first place in
the Bench of <HI>Scabins.</HI> He is chosen to this Office by
the <HI>Burgomasters</HI> with the consent and approbation
of the <HI>Vroetschap</HI> for three years: though he may
continue in Office six or more, if they see good.
He must have been a Freeman at least seven years
fore he be chosen. His Office is with the <HI>Burgomasters</HI>
and <HI>Scabins</HI> to make Laws and Constitutions: to ap∣prehend
and imprison all Malefactors within the Li∣berties
of the City. He, as chief Judge in civil as well
as criminal Causes, hears the Pleadings, and with
consent of the <HI>Burgomasters Scabins</HI> pronounces
Sentence, condemning the guilty to Death, if the
Cause require, and taking care that the Sentence
be executed. In other Cities the <HI>Praetor</HI> hath to do
only in criminal Causes, being no more than the
Commonwealths Solicitor or publick Accuser and
Prosecutor of Malefactors.</P>
<P>The number of <HI>Burgomasters</HI> is twelve, whereof
four are <HI>regent</HI> yearly. They must not be under
forty years of age. Every year by the major Vote
of all the Burgomasters that have ever been Scabins,
three out of the twelve are chosen to be Regents,
<PB N="43" REF="31"/>
which three newly elect take to themselves a fourth
out of the three chosen the year before, who gives
the three new ones their Oaths, and hath the Pre∣sidency
the three first Moneths. Out of the other
eight are other Officers chosen, as Treasurers, Ma∣sters
of Hospitals; one for the Convention of the
States at the <HI>Hague;</HI> one for the Council of the Ad∣miralty
in <HI>Amsterdam, &amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Burgomasters</HI> Office
is to govern the City, to arbitrate differences be∣tween
man and man, to take care of the Streets,
Walls, Houses and publick Buildings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When
one of the twelve dies, another is chosen into his
room by the <HI>Vroetschap.</HI> As for the <HI>Scabins,</HI> the
<HI>Vroetschap</HI> chuse fourteen persons, out of which the
<HI>Burgomasters</HI> take seven; but so that none of them
be near of kin to the <HI>Scout</HI> or the <HI>Regent Burgoma∣sters.</HI>
To these seven the new and old <HI>Burgomasters</HI>
with the new chosen <HI>Scabins</HI> do by most voices add
two out of the seven that were chosen the last year;
the which two for that year are the first and second
Presidents. The Scabins are Judges in all Causes
civil and criminal.</P>
<P>The Council of 36 or <HI>Vroe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>schap</HI> continue in place
during Life, and when one dies the rest chuse an∣other
into his room, but none under 25 years of
age. This Council chuses the fourteen Scabins, and
is assembled upon important occasions by the
Burgomasters for their Advice and Direction in
the weighty Affairs and Concerns of the City.
The Supreme Power seems chiefly to rest in
these.</P>
<P>Formerly none was capable of being <HI>Burgomaster</HI>
except his Father had been a Freeman a year and
six weeks before he was born; but of late they
have made a Constitution, that he who will pay
five hundred Gilders, may be made free of the
City, and capable of being Burgomaster after seven
years. Any one may be made a Freeman for fifty
<PB N="44" REF="32"/>
Gilders, but then he shall never be capable of being
chosen <HI>Burgomaster.</HI></P>
<P>The Describer of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> saith that there were
in that City 18 years ago 54000 Houses, whereas
in <HI>Paris</HI> there were then but 46000, which is a
thing by no means to be credited.</P>
<P>The Militia of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> consists of 54 Compa∣nies
divided into five Regiments, each containing
eleven Companies, and every Company consisting
of 150 men, so that the whole amounts to 8250.
Two Companies watch every night for the guard
of the City.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 16. we took Boat for <HI>Vtrecht,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vtrecht.</NOTE> where we
arrived at six hours end. This is a great Town
and the head of a Province, environed with a thick
and high Wall and a deep Trench. The Streets
and Buildings far short of the Elegancy, Beauty
and Cleanliness of those in <HI>Holland;</HI> much like the
Houses and Streets of our <HI>English</HI> Towns. Water
runs through many of the Streets in deep Chanels.
The <HI>Domo</HI> or Cathedral Church hath a great tall
Tower, ascended by 460 Steps, from whence we
had a fair Prospect of the City and Countrey round
about. Here is an University erected by the States
of the United Provinces in the year 1636. Who

<P>The Garrison consisted of eight Companies of
Soldiers, whereof one was <HI>English.</HI> The Govern∣ment
is by an upper and under <HI>Scout,</HI> and four Bur∣gomasters,
whereof two new chosen yearly.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 18. we went by Boat to <HI>Vianen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vianen.</NOTE> passing
over a Branch of the River <HI>Rhene</HI> called the <HI>Lech.</HI>
This is a privileged Town, wall'd and trench'd
about, subject to the Lord of <HI>Brederode.</HI> Here we
noted an Engine or wheel for the weaving of Inkle
and Tape, which moves many Shuttles at once.
The same day we travelled on to <HI>Leerdam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leerdam</NOTE> three
hours distant from <HI>Vianen,</HI> a small inconsiderable
Town, belonging to the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 19. we passed through <HI>Asperen</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Asperen.</NOTE> a small
wall'd Town, and further on ferried over the River
<PB N="48" REF="34"/>
<HI>Wale (Vahalis</HI> in <HI>Latine</HI>) to a pretty pleasant wall'd
Town called <HI>Bommel</HI> standing in an Island.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bommel.</NOTE></P>
<P>Here lay in Garrison four Companies of Soldiers,
whereof one of <HI>Scotchmen.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from hence we ferried over the <HI>Mose,</HI> and
passed by a strong Fort nigh the Water called <HI>Creve∣coeur,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Creve∣coeur.</NOTE>
and not much further another called <HI>Engelen,</HI>
and after four hours came to the <HI>Bosch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bosch.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Hertogen∣bosch</HI>
the Dutch call it, and the French <HI>Bois le duc,</HI>
i. e. <HI>Sylva Ducis.</HI> Before we entred the Town, we
passed through a Water and over two Draw Brid∣ges.
This Place is situate on a Hill in the midst of
a low fenny Level of a great extent, the greatest
part whereof is (at least now was) covered with
Water, so that the only Avenues to the Town are
upon artificial Causways. It is encompassed with
a strong Wall and a deep Trench. At one end
stands a Citadel strongly fortified, which commands
the Town. By reason of its Situation and Fortifi∣cations,
one would judge this Place impregnable,
yet hath it been taken in the late Wars. At our
being there were kept in Garrison for the Defence
of this important Strength 21 Companies of Foot
and four Troops of Horse. In the Quire of S. <HI>Johns</HI>
Church are painted the Arms of many of the Knights
of the Golden Fleece and over the upper Stalls or
Seats this written in <HI>French, Le treshaut &amp; tres puis∣sant</HI>
Philip, <HI>dit le bon, &amp;c.</HI> which because it con∣tains
the History of the Authors first Institution
and Model of this Order, I thought fit to translate
into <HI>English,</HI> and here set down. <Q>The most High
and Mighty prince <HI>Philip</HI> called the Good, by the
Grace of God Duke of <HI>Burgundy, Lorain</HI> and <HI>Bra∣bant,</HI>
in the year 1429. in the City of <HI>Bruges,</HI>
did in imitation of <HI>Gedeon</HI> create and institute to
the Honour of God and the virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and
for the sake of <HI>S. Andrew</HI> Protector and Patron of
<HI>Burgundy,</HI> a Company or Society of Honourable
<PB N="49" REF="34"/>
Knights, into which might be received Emperors,
Kings, Dukes, Marquesses and other Personages,
as well of his own Subjects as of forein Countries,
provided they were of Noble bloud and good fame:
and called these great Persons, <HI>Knights of the Golden
Fleece,</HI> to whom he gave for perpetual Chief, him
that should be lawful Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and have
the Seigneury or Lordship of the <HI>Low-Countries;</HI> li∣miting
their number to 24, comprehending also the
Chief. And for occurrences and use of the Order
he created four Honourable Officers, <HI>viz.</HI> A Chan∣cellor,
a Treasurer, a Secretary, and a King of
Arms. And for the Establishment and well regu∣lating
of this Order he made notable Statutes and
Ordinances</Q>. The Houses of this Town are of a
different make from those of <HI>Holland,</HI> the outside
being covered with Boards, like those of <HI>Eden∣burgh</HI>
in <HI>Scotland.</HI> We observed great store of wild
Fowl to frequent the Waters hereabout; and found
growing wild <HI>Herniaria hirsuta</HI> on the sandy and
gravelly Banks.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 20. We took a Wagon drawn by three
Horses abreast, as is usual in these Countries, which
in six hours time brought us to <HI>Eindhoven,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eindho∣ven.</NOTE> a small
wall'd Town; and thence in four hours more to <HI>Haumont.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hau∣mont.</NOTE> a pitiful walled Town belonging to the
Bishop of <HI>Liege. June</HI> 21. Three hours Riding
brought us to another little wall'd Town called <HI>Bry;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bry.</NOTE>
the Houses whereof were old and decaying. Be∣tween
<HI>Haumont</HI> and this place, we rode over Heaths
of great extent, called the <HI>Champagne.</HI> We then
left the level Countrey and ascended some Hills,
from whence we had a pleasant Prospect of the
<HI>Mose</HI> and <HI>Maestricht,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mae∣stricht.</NOTE> where we arrived this Evening,
though it be accounted seven hours distant from
<HI>Bry.</HI> This City is fortified with good Outworks,
besides a strong Wall and Trench, garrisoned with
31 Companies of Foot, and six Troops of Horse,
<PB N="50" REF="35"/>
it being a great Town and a Frontier. Half of the
Magistrates are Protestants and half of the <HI>Romish</HI>
Religion. The greater part of the Citizens <HI>Ro∣manists.</HI>
There are in Town near 20 Cloisters or
Monasteries of both Sexes; and they have the free
and publick Exercise of their Religious Worship.
For the Protestants there are three <HI>Dutch</HI> Churches,
and one <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> which those Nations
use alternately. The old Buildings of his City are
like those of the <HI>Bosch;</HI> but since the States have
been Masters of it, it is become a rich and thriving
place, and they are building fair new brickt Houses
space. They were also setting up a large Stone
Stadthouse, of a square Figure, resembling that at
<HI>Amesterdam.</HI> The River <HI>Meuse</HI> divides the City into
two parts, which are joined together by a broad
stone-Bridge of nine Arches. The lesser part over the
Water is called, <HI>Wick.</HI> The Garrison-Soldiers are
all Protestants.</P>
<P>The Common People of <HI>Holland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Man∣ners and particular Customs of the <HI>Low-Dutch.</HI></NOTE> especially Inn∣keepers,
Wagoners (Foremen they call them) Boat∣men
and Porters are surly and uncivil. The Wa∣goners
bait themselves and their Horses four or five
times in a days Journey. Generally the <HI>Dutch</HI> men
and women are almost always eating as they travel,
whether it be by Boat, Coach or Wagon. The men
are for the most part big-boned are gross-bodied.
The first Dish at Ordinaries and Entertainments is
usually a Salade, <HI>Sla</HI> they call it, of which they eat
abundance in <HI>Holland.</HI> Their Meat they commonly
stew and make <HI>Hotchpots</HI> of it. Puddings neither
here nor in any place we have travelled beyond Sea
do they eat any, either not knowing the goodness
of the Dish, or not having the Skill to make them:
<HI>Puddings</HI> and <HI>Brawm</HI> are Dishes proper to <HI>England.</HI>
Boil'd Spinage minc'd and buttered (sometimes also
with Currans added) is a great Dish all over these
Countreys. The Common People feed much upon
<PB N="51" REF="35"/>
<HI>Cabiliau</HI> (that is Cod-fish) and pickled Herrings,
which they know how to cure or prepare better than
we do in <HI>England.</HI> You shall seldome fail of hung
Beef in any Inn you come into, which they cut into
thin slices and eat with Bread and Butter, laying
the slices upon the Butter. They have four or five
sorts of Cheese, three they usually bring forth and
set before you. (1.) Those great round Cheeses,
coloured red on the outside, commonly in <HI>England</HI>
called <HI>Holland</HI>-Cheeses. (2.) Cummin-seed Cheese.
(3.) Green Cheese, said to be so coloured with the
juice of Sheeps Dung. This they scrape upon Bread
buttered, and so eat. (4.) Sometimes <HI>Angelot's.</HI>
(5.) Cheese like to our common Countrey Cheese.
Milk is the cheapest of all Belly-Provisions. Their
strong Beer, (thick Beer they call it, and well they
may) is sold for three Stivers the Quart, which is
more than three pence <HI>English.</HI> All manner of Vi∣ctuals
both Meat and Drink are very dear, not for
the Scarcity of such Commodities, but partly by
reason of the great Excise and Impost wherewith they
are charged, partly by reason of the abundance of
Money that is stirring here. By the way we may
note, that the dearness of this sort of Provisions
is an argument of the Riches of a Town or Coun∣trey,
these things being always cheapest in the poor∣est
places. Land is also here sold at 30 or 40 years
Purchase, and yet both Houses and Land set at very
high annual Rents: So that were not the poor
Workmen and Labourers well paid for their pains,
they could not possibly live. Their Beds are for the
most part like Cabbins, inconveniently short and
narrow, and yet such as they are, you pay in some
places ten Stivers a night the man for them, and in
most six. There is no way for a Stranger to deal
with Inn-keepers, Wagoners, Porters and Boat∣men,
but by bargaining with them before-hand.
Their Houses in <HI>Holland</HI> are kept clean with extra∣ordinary
<PB N="52" REF="36"/>
ordinary niceness; and the Entrance before the
Door curiously paved with Stone. All things both
within and without, Floor, Posts, Walls, Glass,
Houshold-stuff marvellously clean, bright, and hand∣somly
kept: nay some are so extraordinarily cu∣rious
as to take down the very Tiles of their Pent∣houses
and cleanse them. Yet about the preparing
and dressing of their Victuals our <HI>English</HI> Houswives
are, I think, more cleanly and curious than they.
So that no wonder <HI>Englishmen</HI> were formerly noted
for excessive eating, they having greater temptation
to eat, both from the goodness of their Meat, and the
curiosity of the dressing it, than other nations.</P>
<P>In the principal Churches of <HI>Holland</HI> are Organs,
which usually play for some time after the Sermon is
done. The Collections for the Poor are made in Ser∣mon-time,
a Purse with a Bell hanging at the bottom
of it and fastned to the end of a Pole being by the
Collector reach'd to every one. The Psalm to be sung
is marked upon Slates, which are hung up and down
the Churches. The People of these Countreys buy and
sell small Commodities, and travel by Wagon or Boat
upon the Lords Days. Their travelling Wagons are
some covered and some open: few travel on Horse∣back.
No Beggars to be seen in all <HI>Holland,</HI> care
being taken to set on work all that are able, and
Provision made for the aged and impotent. There
are in this one Province of <HI>Holland</HI> three or four
and twenty walled Towns and Cities, and six of
these at least, beside <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> bigger than any
we have in <HI>England</HI> except <HI>London;</HI> and <HI>Amsterdam</HI>
by this time well approaches to the Bigness of
<HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>To these I shall add some Observations concern∣ing
the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> made by my much honoured
Friend <HI>Francis Barnham</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> deceased, at his being
there in the Retinue of my Lord Ambassadour
<HI>Holles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="36"/>
In all the Cities and Towns of Note throughout
the <HI>Vnited Netherlands</HI> there is a continual Watch
kept night and day upon the highest Steeple, for
the more ready and speedy discovery of Fires, or
other things of a surprising nature, which we
have already noted in our Description of the City of
<HI>Leyden.</HI></P>
<P>All Differences arising between Skippers and Fore∣men,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are decided by casting the Die: this we
often observed them to do, when several of them
strove who should carry us.</P>
<P>The Rain that falls upon the Houses is by Pipes
and Gutters conveyed into a Cistern, and there
reserved for the uses of the House, as at <HI>Venice</HI> in
<HI>Italy.</HI> This particular we have also before taken
notice of in the Description of <HI>Leyden.</HI></P>
<P>The generality of the <HI>Dutch</HI> from the better sort
to the meanest, do much dread their Superiours:
I think the cause is, because upon Complaint made,
there is speedy care taken to do Justice.</P>
<P>The generality of the People of all sorts are strange∣ly
given to the humour of running up and down to
see any new or strange thing. The Common sort
have any thing that is rich or gay in great admira∣tion,
insomuch that when my Lord <HI>Holles</HI> made his
Entry into <HI>Breda,</HI> the Coronets that were on the
top of his Coach were talkt of with wonder all the
Countrey over.</P>
<P>The People universally are great lovers of Mo∣ney,
very covetous and greedy of Gain, yet in their
Bargains punctual and just. The Knowledge of
most of them extends no further than the Arts of
getting Money, and an ability to talk of State-Affairs,
wherein you shall meet with mean persons
very well seen: I think the Reason may be,
because the lowest of them is not without hopes
of coming to be a Burger, and at last one of the
States.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="37"/>
I cannot allow the <HI>Low-Dutch</HI> to be of a valiant
and couragious temper generally, notwithstanding
they fight so well at Sea; For the Constitution of
their Bodies which is Phlegmatic, and the tempe∣rature
of the Air which is moist, and their Diet
which is gross and foggy, forbid it.</P>
<P>Yet are there few or none in these Countries that
die of Consumptions.</P>
<P>There is Liberty of all Religions and Professions,
but abundance of Spies to watch them, that they
disturb not the publick Peace.</P>
<P>I think it harder to be a Traitor under the Go∣vernment
of <HI>Holland</HI> than under any other Kingdom
or State, because they seem to be more watchful
and suspicious.</P>
<P>The People say and print what they please, and
call it Liberty.</P>
<P>The better, much more the worse, sort have
little sense of Honour, governing themselves more
by the Rules of Profit and Advantage, than of Ge∣nerosity
and <HI>Decorum.</HI></P>
<P>Murder is not prosecuted with so much diligence
and concern as Felony or Theft.</P>
<P>The times of the day for Marriages and Burials
are limited, but with difference is respect of places;
for at <HI>Breda</HI> they must bury their dead before 12
of the clock, and at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> not till the After∣noon.</P>
<P>When any famous Deed or Exploit is done by
any of their Nation, it is represented to the People
with all insinuating circumstances, to make them
proud of the Honour of being Subjects in a State
where such mighty deeds are done. Besides, for
encouragement there is for the most part a Monu∣ment
or Statue erected to the memory of them who
do great things.</P>
<P>Their Solemnizations of <HI>Victoirs,</HI> as they call
them, seems to me of great use, like Triumphs
<PB N="55" REF="37"/>
among the <HI>Romans.</HI> For those Bonfires and other
expressions of Joy do make glad the People, and give
them better thoughts of their Governours, and dis∣pose
them to their service.</P>
<P>In the service of God the People seem more de∣lighted
and concerned in that part of Worship
which consists in singing than any other, and they
provide more for it. For in their Churches there
are few other Books among them than Psalters bound
up with the Church-Catechism.</P>
<P>The common sort of Women (not to say all)
seem more fond of and delighted with lascivious
and obscene Talk than either the <HI>English</HI> or the
<HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The Women are said not much to regard Chastity
while unmarried, but when once married none
more chast and true to their Husbands.</P>
<P>The Women even of the better sort do upon
little Acquaintance easily admit saluting with a Kiss:
and it is familiarly used among themselves either
in Frolicks or upon Departures and Returns though
never so short.</P>
<P>The Women are in a sense Privy-Counsellors to
their Husbands<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for they are for the most part
privy to all their Actions: and the Men seldom do
any thing without their Advice and Consent. Yet
doth not this Indulgence enamour them of their
own Nation; for it is said, that if a Woman can
get an <HI>English</HI> Husband, she will never marry a
<HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> when they see their Friends at the
point of Death, and past all hope of Recovery, out
of Pity and Tenderness desirous to rid them out
of their Pain, will sometimes hasten their end by
withdrawing the Pillow or the like. Thus far
Mr. <HI>Barnham.</HI></P>
<P>In most of the Cities and Towns in the <HI>Nether∣lands</HI>
there are a great number of chiming little
<PB N="56" REF="38"/>
Bells which seldom rest, but were to us trouble∣some
with their frequent Jangling. But for Rings
of great Bells all <HI>Europe</HI> cannot shew so many as
<HI>England</HI> alone, so that it might well be called the
<HI>Ringing Island.</HI></P>
<P>A multitude of Storks frequent these Countries,
building upon their Chimnies in the Towns and
Cities as well as Villages; but not in the Territories
of Common-wealths only (as some imagine) but
of Kings and Princes also, as at <HI>Lovain</HI> and elsewhere
in the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Countrey, and in <HI>Germany</HI>
in several Princes Dominions.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 22. we travelled from <HI>Maestricht</HI> to <HI>Liege</HI>
four Leagues distant. In the side of a Hill we a∣scended
at some distance from <HI>Maestricht,</HI> we saw
an arched Passage into a Vault (as we were inform∣ed)
some two hours in length. A good way within
under ground they dig Stone which here they bring
out in Carts. It being a wet season we made no
stay to go into this Vault, therefore I have added
here the Description of it out of the <HI>Philosophical
Transactions</HI> Numb. 67. pag. 2051.</P>
<P>There is an excellent Quarry within Cannon-shot
of <HI>Maestricht</HI> upon the very brink of the River
<HI>Mase,</HI> lying in a Hill, where there are about 25
Fathoms of Rock and Earth over head; the length
of the Hill being of some miles extending along the
River towards <HI>Liege,</HI> situate on the same River;
and towards <HI>Maestricht</HI> having in breadth some half
or quarter of a mile, but somewhat more further
off. This Quarry hath one Entry towards the Ri∣ver,
where Carts can pass with great case, and un∣load
the Stones upon the brink of the River, the
Quarry within lying parallel to the Horizon or
Level, (which is a great advantage) and elevated
but very little above the River. This same Quarry
which hath well nigh undermined the whole Hill,
affords one of the most surprising Prospects, when
<PB N="57" REF="38"/>
well lighted with many Torches, that one can ima∣gine.
For there are thousands of square Pillars in
large level Walks, and those almost every where
above twenty, and in some places many more foot
high, and all wrought with so much neatness and
regularity, that one would think it had been made
rather with curious Workmanship for an under∣ground
Palace, than that those Pillars and Galle∣ries
were made by Quarriers that did it only for
getting Stone to build above ground. This Quarry
serveth the People that live thereabouts for a kind of
impregnable Retreat when Armies march that way.
For being acquainted with all the ways in it, they
carry into it whatsoever they would have safe, as
well their Horse and Cattel as their moveable Fur∣niture,
till the danger be over, there being so vast
a deal of room, that 40000 people may shelter
themselves in it. And he that should attempt to
seek them out in this vast Wilderness of Walks and
Pillars, without an expert Guide, would not only
be in hazard of losing his way, but of being knockt
on the head at the corner of every Pillar, where
People lurking in the dark with their Carbines and
Fowling-Pieces would have fair opportunity of
shooting at them by the Light of their own Tor∣ches,
<HI>&amp;c. vide.</HI></P>
<P>Further upon the Downs we saw three or four
more of these Passages, and from hence had again
a very pleasant Prospect of <HI>Maestricht</HI> and the Coun∣trey
about the River <HI>Mose.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Liege</HI> or <HI>Luyck</HI> is a large City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liege.</NOTE> but not comparable
to the <HI>Holland</HI> Towns for Beauty or Riches; built
for the most part of Timber; some of the Houses
being covered with boards after the <HI>Scotch</HI> fashion,
and some with Slate [the Walls I mean,] the rest
uncovered and of Clay. The Streets are neither
broad not clean-kept. The River <HI>Mose</HI> here divides
itself, and runs through the Town in two or three
<PB N="58" REF="39"/>
Branches, over which are several Bridges. Here
is a convenient Key, and upon the River we ob∣served
Boats of an extraordinary length, the like
whereto we had before seen at <HI>Vtrecht</HI> and <HI>Dort.</HI>
This City is pleasantly situate and environed almost
round with Hills. On the Brow of a Hill which
hangs over it, stands a Fort or Castle which com∣mands
it. Upon the sides of these Hills are abun∣dance
of Orchards and Cherry-Gardens: On those
near the City we first saw Vineyards; though there
are near <HI>Lovain,</HI> which we saw not. All Belly-Provisions
are cheap here. A great many of Poor
and Beggars you meet with at every corner, but
they are not importunate if denied. The Coun∣trey
People are civil, well-manner'd and kind
to Strangers. The Women are of a dusky Com∣plexion,
and generally not so handsom as the <HI>Hol∣landers.</HI>
They do a great deal of Drudgery, the
poorer sort carrying Coals and other Burthens on
their backs in Baskets of a Conical Figure, to the
end or bottom of which they apply a stiff Baston,
and so rest themselves without setting down their
Burthens. Near this City are gotten Coals in great
plenty, but they lie very deep under ground; some
of us went down into a Pit 150 yards deep. The
Coal are like our Stone-Coal. The arts they use
to get Air enough to serve them in the bottom of
these Delfs see in the <HI>Philosoph. Transact.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Luyck</HI> they use also for Fewel a sort of round
Balls made of Clay mixed with a certain proportion
of Coal, beaten small, tempered together, and dri∣ed
in the Sun, which they call <HI>Hotshots.</HI> These we
never saw used any where but here, though the
making of them is described in many Books. They
serve to slake the Heat of the Fire, and keep the
Coals from burning out too fast. Here and at <HI>Na∣mur</HI>
(as we were told) are made Stone-Pots and
Jugs. The Cathedral Church is dedicated to S. <HI>Lam∣bert,</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="39"/>
to which belong 60 <HI>Canonici majores,</HI> who
must be all of Noble Blood, except some few Scho∣lars
which they may chuse in. By these the Bishop
and Prince of <HI>Liege</HI> is elected. Besides these there
are twelve <HI>Canonici mediocres</HI> and twelve <HI>minores sive
parvae mensae.</HI> On weighty occasions the Prince as∣sembles
the States of the Countrey for their Advice.
The <HI>Clergy, Gentry</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> send their several
Deputies to these Conventions. No Law can be
made nor any great Tax imposed without their
consents. In this City are an incredible number
of Monasteries or Religious Houses as they call
them. In the Garden of the <HI>English Jesuites</HI> Col∣lege
we saw many ingenious Dials invented by <HI>Fran∣ciscus
Linus.</HI> In the Church of the <HI>Gulielmites</HI> Cloi∣ster
without the Walls we saw Sir <HI>John Mondeville</HI>'s
Tomb-Stone.</P>
<P>In the Vestry are kept his Saddle, Spurs and
Bridle-bit, as also two great Knives, which the
Monks, who shew'd us these things, told us were
given him by the Emperor of the <HI>Turks,</HI> being such
as himself used. Upon his Tomb-Stone was this
Inscription:

<P><HI>June</HI> 26.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spaw.</NOTE> we travelled hilly and stony way from
<HI>Liege</HI> to the <HI>Spaw,</HI> seven hours distant. We had
in prospect on the left hand as we rode, <HI>Franchimont</HI>
Castle, and soon after came to the view of a deep
Valley, in the bottom of which lay the <HI>Spaw.</HI> It is
a pleasant little walled Town, though called a
Village, indifferently well built for a place so re∣mote
from Commerce. The Inhabitants reap no
small benefit from the frequency of Strangers, which
in the Summer-time repair thither in great numbers
to drink the Medicinal Waters. There is one Well
called <HI>Pouhont,</HI> within the Town, in the Market-place,
which tasts strong of Vitriol, the Virtues
whereof are contained in this Distich written over
it
<Q><L>Obstructum reserat, durum terit, humida siccat,
Debile fortificat, si tamen arte bibis.</L></Q></P>
<P>The other Wells are at a good d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nce from the
Town. (1.) <HI>Sauvenir,</HI> to the Eastward, about an
hours walk remote, (2.) <HI>Geronster,</HI> as far to the
Southward, and (3.) <HI>Tonnelet,</HI> about the mid-way
between <HI>Pouhont</HI> and <HI>Sauvenir.</HI> These Waters seem∣ed
to me more brisk and sprightly, and better sated
with Mineral Juices than any I have tasted in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and doubtless are more nimble and vigorous
in their Operations. But of their several Natures
and Virtues <HI>Henricus ab Heers</HI> hath written a parti∣cular
Treatise, entitled <HI>Spadacrene,</HI> to which I re∣fer
the Reader that is desirous to know more of
them. In the Woods and upon the Rocks near this
Town we found many rare Plants, which we had
<PB N="61" REF="40"/>
not before met with, I mean spontaneously grow∣ing
in their natural places, <HI>viz. Asclepias flore albo,
Polygonatum minus, Cyanus major, Rapunculus spicatus,
Campanula persicifolia, Sideritis flore pallido similis
Ladano segetum, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 28. From the <HI>Spaw</HI> we travelled to <HI>Aken,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lim∣bourg.</NOTE>
passing through <HI>Limbourg</HI> three hours distant, a
Town considerable for its Strength, being situate
on the side of a Hill, and encompassed with a strong
Wall and Trench; not for its Bigness, it consisting
only of one short broad Street, nor for its Beauty,
the Buildings being all of Wood. The Garrison at
our being there was about 300 Soldiers. Before
we entred the Town we were met upon the way by
some of these Soldiers, who very insolently stopt
our Horses, demanding Money of us, which we
were forced to give according to their discretion,
before they would let us pass, which though it were
no considerable Sum, yet was more than we were
willing should be violently extorted from us. When
we were past the Town, we met also with many of
these Straglers, by whom (it was told us) many Rob∣beries
are committed hereabout.</P>
<P><HI>Aken,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aken.</NOTE> called by the French <HI>Aix la Chappelle,</HI> to
distinguish it, I suppose, from <HI>Aix</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> is a
free City of the Empire, very considerable for its
Strength and Greatness, being encompassed with a
double Wall, and having in it 30 Churches. About
now some 15 years ago here happened a lamentable
Fire which almost ruined the Town, burning down
to the ground 4500 Houses, from which Calamity
it was not half recovered at the time of our being
there. In the great <HI>Piazza</HI> or Market-place is a
handsom Fountain, with this Inscription about the
edges of the Basin: <HI>Hîc aquis per Granum Princi∣pem

wherewith the Emperor is crown'd, and the Sword
of <HI>Charlemaigne,</HI> which he holds when he is crown'd;
and is obliged to wear by his side three days toge∣ther,
and wherewith he creates Noblemen; as also
the Gospels, said to be written by the Evangelists
own hands, are here kept, and every Coronation
sent to <HI>Frankfurt.</HI> The Chair wherein the Empe∣ror
sits when he is crown'd here, hath its Sides of
Ivory, and its Bottom as they fondly imagine of the
Wood of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Ark.</P>
<P>This City (according to the best information we
could get there,) is governed by a Maior, two Con∣suls
or Burgomasters, fourteen Scabins and about
120 Senators or Counsellors. The Maior is Presi∣dent
of the Scabins and executes their Sentences;
he is put in by the Duke of <HI>Gulick</HI> and continues du∣ring
Life, <HI>modò bene se gesserit.</HI> The Consuls are
chosen by the Suffrage of the several Companies of
the City, and continue two years <HI>modò bene se gesse∣rint;</HI>
every year there is one chosen. One that is
no Senator may be chosen Consul or Burgomaster,
and yet these have the chief power. The Scabins
are Judges and continue during Life; when one of
them dies, the rest chuse another in his place. The
Senators are chosen by the several Companies, of
which there are about fourteen or fifteen in this
City. Every Company chuses eight. Half the Se∣nate
are yearly chosen. The Territory of this City
is large, containing about 200 Villages, and is for
the most part encompassed with Mountains. We
saw here the manner of making Brass of Copper,
by mingling and melting therewith <HI>Lapis Calami∣naris,</HI>
which changes the colour thereof from red
to yellow, and increaseth the weight by thirty in
<PB N="63" REF="41"/>
the Hundred. But that for which this Place is
most remarkable, and from which it took its Name,
are the Hot Baths, of which there are several with∣in
the Walls and others without, at <HI>Borcet</HI> a great
Village less than an <HI>English</HI> mile distant. The
Waters of <HI>Borcet</HI> at the Sources where they issue
out of the Earth are much hotter than those of the
<HI>Bath</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and the Springs more plenti∣ful.
The People there told us, and I can easily
believe them, that they will serve to boil Eggs in.
Their Tast seemed to us saltish. They are used
outwardly for Bathing, and taken inwardly
for many Diseases. As we walked to <HI>Borcet</HI> we
could not but take notice of a Pool whose Wa∣ters
were almost tepid by reason of a little Stream
from the Hot Baths running through it, wherein
we were assured were bred and fed good store of
Fish, which are put into cold Water for a moneth
or two before they eat them. But of the Nature,
Kinds, Ingredients and Uses of the several hot Wa∣ters,
as well those of the City, as of <HI>Borcet,</HI> the
following abstract of an Epistolary Discourse con∣cerning
them written in <HI>French,</HI> and published by
<HI>Francis Bloudel</HI> M. D. will give the Reader more
particular Information.</P>

<HEAD>Observations concerning the Baths of
Aken, collected out of an Epistolary
Discourse Published in French by
Francis Blondel, M. D.</HEAD>
<P>NOt to trouble the Reader with the various Opi∣nions
of Antient and Modern Philosophers
concerning the Cause of the actual Heat of natural
Baths, our Authors accompt thereof in reference
to these of <HI>Aken</HI> is in brief as follows.</P>
<P>These Waters (saith he) passing through a certain
argillaceous Earth, pregnant with a kind of nitrous
Salt, almost of the same tast with the Waters of the
Baths (which is to be found in good quantity in
the lands about this City) charge themselves there∣with,
and so become a <HI>menstruum</HI> capable of dissol∣ving
such Minerals and Metals as are conteined in
the Veins of the Earth through which they run.
This Solution he conceives is made by piercing
and corroding the Minerals after the same manner
as Spirit of Nitre and other <HI>Aquae Stygiae</HI> are wont
to do, which usually causes a great Ebullition and
Heat. So then the actual Heat of these Springs
proceeds from the Mixture and Encounter of their
Waters (impregnate as is before intimated) with
the Mineral and Metallic Substances, Juices and
Spirits conteined in the Veins of the Earth through
which they have their Course. The nitrous Salt
fore-mentioned may perhaps be the <HI>Hermetic</HI> Salt
of Monsieur <HI>Rochas,</HI> or the <HI>esurine</HI> Salt of <HI>Helmont.</HI>
Now the Water once heated, being conteined in
the Vaults of the Mountains as in a Stove, continues
hot a long time, the Eruption thereof being, it is
<PB N="65" REF="42"/>
likely, at a good distance from the place where it
did at first conceive its Heat.</P>
<P>At the long continuance and duration of the Heat
of these Waters for so many ages past no man need
wonder: For (1.) It is generally taken for granted
that all sorts of Mines do grow and increase by
addition, converting the more refined, subtile part
of the Earth, and which hath a seminal disposition
of such a change, into their own nature. (2.) The
nitrous Salts, the first Ingredients of these Waters,
are also restored in their <HI>Matrices,</HI> after the same
manner as we see it happens in the <HI>Caput mortuum</HI>
of Vitriol, which though the Vitriol hath been once
or twice extracted from it, will by being exposed
to the Air again recover more; whether it be by
conversion of its <HI>Matrix</HI> into its own nature by a kind
of Aggeneration and Transmutation, or by imbi∣bing
and retaining those subtile and volatile saline
Exhalations, which continually ascend out of the
Earth or wander up and down the Air.</P>
<P>As for the Ingredients of these hot Waters in ge∣neral
he saith, That besides a threefold Salt-Nitre
<HI>fixed, volatile</HI> and <HI>mingled</HI> or <HI>Armoniack,</HI> they par∣take
of a fixed and volatile <HI>Sulphur,</HI> a <HI>Manna</HI> of
Alum, some Vitriol, divers Metals, as Copper and
Iron, a very little volatile Earth, a certain <HI>Argilla,</HI>
Sand and Calaminary Flowers. That they parti∣cipate
of Copper he proves in that the Territory of
<HI>Aken</HI> abounds in divers places with <HI>Lapis Calami∣naris,</HI>
which is as it were the Aliment of Copper:
For being mingled in the Furnaces with red Copper
it augments it by the addition of 30 pound weight
<HI>per Cent.</HI> and gives it a yellow or golden Tincture.
As for Iron, the many ferrugineous Springs that are
found within and without this City are an evident
testimony that there are plenty of Iron Mines here∣about;
and therefore most likely it is, if not cer∣tain,
that these hot Waters charge themselves with
<PB N="66" REF="43"/>
that Metal. That they contain a threefold nitrous Salt,
he proves from their natural Evaporations. (1.) The
fixed is found in the Wells of <HI>Borcet</HI> and the <HI>Emperor,</HI>
crystallized into small shining square grains, ming∣led
with a little Flower of Sulphur, sticking to the
Covers of those Wells, which have not been of a
long time opened. It may be also found in the
Chymical examination of these Waters by Evapora∣tion
or Destillation. (2.) The <HI>Volatile</HI> is carried up
by the volatile Sulphur, as is hereafter shew'd in the
Description of the first sort of these Baths. (3.) The
<HI>mingled</HI> or <HI>Armoniac</HI> is daily seen in all the Waters
of the City and of <HI>Borcet,</HI> swimming in little Cy∣linders
on the surface of the Water, and this is that
Cream or Scum which is ordinarily found upon
the Waters in the Basins. That they contain the
rest of the fore-mentioned Ingredients shall be
shewn in the Description of the particular Baths:
the Waters whereof our Author reduces to four sorts.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Nitro-sulphureous,</HI> such are those of the <HI>Em∣perors</HI>
Bath, the <HI>Little</HI> Bath, and S. <HI>Quirin</HI>'s Bath.
2. <HI>Sulphureo-nitrous,</HI> such are those of <HI>Compus</HI> or
the <HI>Poor-mens</HI> Bath, the <HI>Rose</HI>-Bath and S <HI>Cornelius</HI>
his Bath. 3. <HI>Sulphureo-nitro-vitriolic,</HI> such is ano∣ther
Bath of the same S. <HI>Cornelius.</HI> 4. <HI>Salso-alumino∣nitrous,
viz.</HI> those of <HI>Borcet</HI> a Village adjoining to
<HI>Aken.</HI></P>
<P>I. As for the <HI>Nitro-sulphureous</HI> kind, those of the
<HI>Emperors</HI> Bath and the <HI>Little</HI> Bath are but one Wa∣ter
coming from the same Source, and collected in
one and the same Well. That part reserved in the
<HI>Emperors</HI> Bath is divided into five great Basins or
Receptacles: that in the <HI>Little</HI> Bath into three.
All which might be renewed daily, if time would
permit, the Spring is so copious. But by reason of
the excessive Heat of the Waters, it is necessary oft-times
that they stand in the Basin 16 or 18 hours to
cool, before they be fit for the Patients use. Not∣withstanding
<PB N="67" REF="43"/>
when they are come to a just temper,
one may bath in them and endure them a long time,
as those of <HI>Borcet,</HI> without any Inconvenience. This
Source hath that of peculiar to itself, that in its
Well one may find distinctly a quantity of <HI>Nitre</HI>
coagulated, and good plenty of Flowers of <HI>Sulphur</HI>
very light, purely fine and well sented. The <HI>Nitre</HI>
sticks to the sides of the Well, and so do the Flow∣ers
of <HI>Sulphur</HI> above that: The which sometimes
whether by the extraordinary boiling up of the
Fountain, or by the impetuosity of the ascending
Vapours, or by their own weight are broken off,
and fall back into the Source; from whence being
no more dissolved by the Water, they come forth
intire into the Basins. If you take of this Water,
and let it stand in a Vessel certain days, it will pre∣cipitate
of these yellow Flowers of <HI>Sulphur</HI> to the
bottom of the Vessel. Besides these <HI>volatile</HI> Flow∣ers,
these Waters contein also <HI>fixt</HI> Flowers of <HI>Sul∣phur,</HI>
a competent quantity of <HI>Nitre</HI> and <HI>volatile,
fixt</HI> and <HI>mixt</HI> or <HI>Armoniac,</HI> a little <HI>Alum,</HI> less <HI>Vitriol,</HI>
the Spirits and Principles of <HI>Copper</HI> and <HI>Iron,</HI> a very
little volatile Earth, <HI>Argilla</HI> and Sand: no <HI>Bitumen,</HI>
for let them stand as long as you please, you shall
find no fatty substance swimming upon them as
upon the <HI>Spaw</HI> Waters. The volatile <HI>Sulphur</HI> eva∣porates
so strongly that it carries up with it a quan∣tity
of <HI>Nitre,</HI> as one may see after the solution of
the Vapours congeled and frozen in Winter-time,
when it remains incorporated upon the Walls in
the places where the Iceicles were. These Waters
are in weight equal to those of the <HI>Spaw;</HI> coming
fresh out of the Source they appear whitish or blu∣ish,
but having stood a while and grown cold,
greenish. They are very pure and leave no kind of
Mud or <HI>Lutum thermale</HI> behind them; in cooling
they yield a small Scum or Cream of Nitre. Far
from their Source, being wrought upon by the Air,
<PB N="68" REF="44"/>
they let fall a little whitish Sediment, as those of
<HI>Bor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et</HI> do a blackish one. They preserve the colour
of Roses put into them and cause them not to wi∣ther,
as doth common Water. The Vapours ascen∣ding
from them make Silver Plate black, as those
of <HI>Boreet</HI> make it white. The other Source of
S. <HI>Quirin</HI>'s Bath differs from these in no other re∣spect,
save that the Water thereof is cooler. It is
reserved in three Basins. In this Well you find
neither <HI>Sulphur</HI> nor <HI>Salt-peter</HI> sticking to the sides,
probably because it is open or uncovered.</P>
<P>II. The second or <HI>Sulphureo-nitrous</HI> sort of <HI>Com∣pus, &amp;c.</HI>
though they spring up in several places
and have different Wells, yet is the Nature of them
all, their Composition and Mineral Ingredients the
same. The <HI>Poor mens</HI> Bath hath one great Basin or
Receptacle, the <HI>Rose</HI> Bath four, whereof two only
are used, and S. <HI>Cornelius</HI>'s Bath of this Mine
two. These Waters are fit for use at all sea∣sons,
being of a temperate Heat, more efficacious
and of greater force in their Operations than the
first sort; they weigh two <HI>per Cent.</HI> more than they,
and are of a stronger Sent. In these is never found
any <HI>Sulphur</HI> condensed, no not in their Wells
though they be covered: but when they are em∣ptied
and new Water let in (as in the <HI>Rose</HI>-Bath) the
Water running down along the Walls and Seats into
the bottom of the Basins or Conservatories, the exter∣nal
Air prevailing upon it so spread and in such little
quantity arrests, fixes and condenses its <HI>Sulphur</HI> all
along the said Walls and Seats, refreshing the eyes
of the Spectators with its Beauty and Lustre. But
the Water arising in the fore-mentioned Basins, and
covering the Seats and Walls, the Sulphur again
unites and incorporates with its Dissolvent, and
disappears and hides itself therein. The Water of
these Sources conteins great quantity of Sulphur
very fine and sweet, less nitrous Salt, a little Vitriol
<PB N="69" REF="44"/>
and less Alum, more of the other Minerals and Me∣tals
than the first sort or those of <HI>Borcet.</HI> So that
they are more compounded, oleous and bituminous
than any of the other Sources; and though they
come out of the Earth very temperate as to actual
Heat, yet can sick persons hardly endure them for
any long time, for the most part scarce half an
hour.</P>
<P>III. The third sort which I call <HI>Sulphureo-nitro-vitriolic,</HI>
and is also of S. <HI>Cornclius,</HI> differs from the
precedent in that the Tast is a little more acid, the
Smell sweeter and liker that of Spirit of Vitriol,
and the Touch less oily. It is of less Efficacy in use
than the second sort, and of more than the first.
Of this Source there are three Basins, which with
the two others of S. <HI>Cornelius</HI> before-mentioned
make five in this House. These Waters do agree
much what in their Composition with the prece∣dent.
They are very pure and clear, especially
in their Wells; and though they seem troubled
in their Basins, yet taken in a Glass they appear
clear.</P>
<P>IV. The fourth or <HI>Salso-alumino-nitrous</HI> kind are
those of the Neighbourhood or <HI>Borcet.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Borcet Baths.</NOTE> These
come out of the Earth extreme hot, and in great
abundance, are all of the same Medicinal Quality,
have several Wells, and are reserved in ten or twelve
Houses, each whereof hath two Basins or Recep∣tacles,
besides which there is a common Bath expo∣sed
to the Air, for the use of poor people. These
Waters cast off a copious Excrement or Tartar,
which yet is not Stone, but only a Sand mingled
with and united to the nitrous and aluminous Salt
of the Water, coagulated by the beating of the
cold Air on its Superficies, to which also concurs
the cold of the Walls exposed to the same Air.
These Excrescencies are found in the subterrancous
Conduits, not only of these but the other Baths in
<PB N="70" REF="45"/>
the City; being held to the Fire they soon become
friable, and are nothing but a pure round Sand like
the common. The higher Houses and Basins have
the more of this Tartar, yet is it so little that it
is not to be seen or perceived in the Water. These
Waters are of a different <HI>Species,</HI> Virtue and Ope∣ration
from those of the City; are very easie to
suffer, and serve often for Divertisement and Re∣creation
to persons that are in health. The content
of them is a great quantity of Sea-Salt and Alum,
less nitrous Salt, a very little Sulphur and not much
of Metallic Substances.</P>
<P>Concerning the Virtues and Effects of these
Waters inwardly taken, he discourses to this pur∣pose:</P>
<P>These Waters taken inwardly are very available
against the Phthisic, <HI>Asthma</HI> or Difficulty of Breath∣ing
occasioned by tough Phlegm lodging in the
branches of the Wind-Pipe; against the Weakness
of the Stomach, Indigestion, Crudities, Flatulencies,
Vomitings, Hiccoughs and inveterate Colics. They
dissipate and dry up all manner of Catarrhs and se∣rous
De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luxions; and are very proper to be drunk
by those that are troubled with the Palsie, before
the use of the Baths. They quicken the Appetite,
cleanse the Blood and open the obstructions of the
Mesentery. They are of excellent use against Hy∣pochondriacal
Maladies, especially in such as have
weak and cold Stomachs. They mollifie the hard∣ness
of the Liver, Spleen and Mesentery. They
dissolve and bring away the Gravel of the Reins
and the lesser Stones: And here he produces many
Examples of such as avoided Stones upon the
drinking these Waters, and among the rest of some
that had drank the <HI>Spaw</HI> Waters, and came from
thence without reciving any Benefit. They cleanse
the Ulcers of the Bladder, dissolving not only the
gross, phlegmatic and viscous Humours which co∣agulate
<PB N="71" REF="45"/>
the Stone, but even the Stone itself whilst it
is yet tender. They have sometimes cured inter∣mittent
Fevers of long continuance, and scrophulous
Tumors. They dry up and heal the Itch, Leprosie
and other Affections of the Skin. They stop the
immoderate Flowing of the <HI>Menses</HI> in Women and
cure the Jaundise, the Paleness and Discolouring of
the Skin in Virgins: and finally they give ease and
relief in the Gout. Of all these Faculties he brings
Instances and Examples in Persons that have been
cured. Particularly that these Waters drunk may
have a power of dissolving the Stone, he proves by
this Experiment: Taking a Stone voided by a man
about two years before, and infusing it in Water hot
from the Fountain for the space of three days, we
found it (saith he) mollified and reduced into a soft
Phlegm. Which Virtue of the Waters was further
confirmed to us by a late Accident: for opening
the Vault of a Well there was found a certain Glue
or Mucilage, which it's to me probable, came from
the solution of the Morter of Lime and Sand in
long time, by the volatile and dissolvent Spirits of
the Waters; especially there being found no other
Cement between the Stones, and in that this same
Glue or Mucilage mingled itself intirely with the
Waters of the Fountains without any appearance
of Scum or Fat swimming on the top, so as Gum
of Cherry or the like is wont to do in Water, and
being cast into the Fire burnt not, but dried up.
These Experiments and Observations were made
upon occasion of a Burgomaster of <HI>Riga</HI> (who being
afflicted with the Stone drank these Waters) his
passing his Urine through a Linen Cloth, and find∣ing
therein a certain thick Phlegm left behind, which
being kept a while upon Paper hardned into a
stony Substance.</P>

<HI>Spier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spier.</NOTE> two miles and an half distant. <HI>Spier</HI> though
it hath a Bishop, yet is it a free City of the Empire,
and governed by its own Magistrates, of considerable
Strength and Greatness. The Houses are most old∣built
of Timber, rather vast than handsom or con∣venient.
We could not learn that there was any
considerable Trade driven here, so that were it not
for the Imperial Chamber (which draws much Com∣pany
hither) we believe it would soon grow poor
and infrequent enough. The <HI>Romish</HI> Religion pre∣vails
most, yet have the <HI>Lutherans</HI> their Church. In
the Cathedral Church are the Monuments of several
<PB N="81" REF="50"/>
Emperors and Bishops who lie interred there. The
Imperial Chamber consists of 36 Assessors and a chief
President appointed by the Emperor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imperial Chamber.</NOTE> besides whom
there are other three Presidents chosen by the Em∣peror
out of the Delegates. Every Elector of the
Empire, and each of the ten Circles send two Dele∣gates
or Assessors. There is another Chamber of
like power at <HI>Vienna.</HI> These Courts determine all
Controversies arising between the several Princes
and States of the Empire by majority of Vote. The
Subjects also of many of the Princes may appeal
from their own Princes to this Court; but it is not
prudent nor safe for them so to do, unless they first
withdraw themselves out of their Territory. Some
Princes, as the Count Palatine, have <HI>Jus non appel∣landi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 21. we returned a little backwards and cros∣sed
over the <HI>Rh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne</HI> to <HI>Manheim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Man∣heim.</NOTE> a Town belonging
to the Prince Elector Palatine, situate just in the
Angle made by the <HI>Neccar</HI> and <HI>Rhene</HI> meeting, and
strongly fortified. The Houses in the late Wars were
most of them beaten down, but now they are rebuild∣ing
them apace, the Prince having given the Town
great Privileges, to invite Strangers to come and in∣habit
there. At the time of our being there, his
Highness was building a new Citadel, which was
like to prove a strong Piece. It wanted not much
then of being finished. Who it was that first ad∣vanced
this place to the dignity of a City and for∣tified
it with Walls, Ditches and Bulwarks, this
Inscription over the Gate towards the <HI>Neccar</HI> will
acquaint the Reader.

<P><HI>July</HI> 22. From <HI>Manheim</HI> we rode to <HI>Heidelberg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heidel∣berg.</NOTE>
just before we entred the Town passing a wooden
Bridge over the <HI>Neccar</HI> covered over with a <HI>tectum,</HI>
as are also many of the great Bridges in <HI>Switzerland,</HI>
to preserve the Timber, as I conceive, from the
injuri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Weather. <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> though none
of the greatest Cities, yet is the chief of the <HI>Pala∣tinate,</HI>
and for its bigness populous; which is much
considering the Devastations made by the late Wars
in this Countrey. The Houses are most of Timber,
yet handsom and in good repair; which argues the
Inhabitants to be industrious and in a thriving con∣dition.
It is situate on the right bank of the River
<HI>Neccar,</HI> under Hills of considerable highth; by rea∣son
of which it cannot be made strong, though
it be encompassed with a double Wall and
Trench.</P>
<P>In this City are five Jurisdictions, (1.) <HI>Aulica,</HI>
under which are all the Princes or Noblemen: of
this Jurisdiction the Marshal of the House is Presi∣dent.
(2.) <HI>Cancellaria,</HI> under which are all the
Councils and other Officers as Advocates, Doctors
of Law, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (3.) <HI>Bellica,</HI> or the Soldiery: the
General is their President. (4.) <HI>Academica,</HI> in
which the <HI>Rector magnificus</HI> presides, and (5.) <HI>Civica.</HI>
The Members of each Jurisdiction may refuse to be
judged by any but their own Judge, before whom
the Plaintiff must implead them, according to the
Maxim in Law, <HI>Actor sequitur forum rei.</HI> The City
is divided into four Quarters, and governed by
<HI>Praetor</HI> and <HI>Burgomasters.</HI> It can raise two Compa∣nies
of Foot and one of Horse. The <HI>Lutherans</HI> are
<PB N="83" REF="51"/>
permitted the Exercise of their Religion here, and
have lately built them a Church: There are also
<HI>Roman Catholics</HI> who have a Church without the
Walls.</P>
<P>About the middle of the ascent of the Hill called
<HI>Koningsthall</HI> stands the Castle where the Prince keeps
his Court, a stately Pile and of great capacity, en∣compassed
with a strong Wall and a deep Trench
hewn out of the Rock, which upon occasion may
be filled with Water. Over the Gate leading into
the Palace is a <HI>Dutch</HI> Inscription, signifying the
building of it by <HI>Ludovicus</HI> V. in the year 1519. It
is not all of one Piece, but since the first Founda∣tion
several Buildings have been added by seve∣ral
Princes. One part is called the <HI>English Buil∣ding.</HI></P>
<P>Under one of the Towers stood the great Tun,
which almost filled a Room. It held 132 Fudders, a
Fudder (as we were informed) being equal to 4 <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Hogsheads. The old Tun is taken in pieces, and
there is a new one in building by the Princes Order,
which is to contain 150 Fudders or 600 Hogsheads.
Being invited by the Princes order we dined in the
Palace, where we observed all things carried with little
noise and great decency. After dinner his Highness was
pleased to call us into his Closet, and shew us many
Curiosities, among others (1.) a Purse made of <HI>Alumen
plumosum,</HI> which we saw put into a Pan of burning
Charcoal till it was throughly ignite, and yet when
taken out and cool, we could not perceive that it
had received any harm at all from the Fire. (2.) Two
Unicorns horns each eight or ten foot long, wreathed
and hollow to the top. By the way we may note,
that these are the Horns of a Fish of the cetaceous
kind, (two distinct <HI>species</HI> whereof you may find de∣scribed
and figured in the <HI>History</HI> and Description of
the <HI>Antilles</HI> or <HI>Caribee</HI> Islands written in <HI>French</HI> by
<HI>R. F.</HI> of <HI>Tertre,</HI> and the Head of one in <HI>Wormius</HI> his
<PB N="84" REF="52"/>
<HI>Musaeum)</HI> not the Horns of a Quadruped as is vul∣garly
but erroneously thought. Whatever the An∣tients
have delivered, modern Voiages and Enquiries
have discovered no other terrestrial Unicorn besides
the <HI>Rhinocerot,</HI> which, its most likely, is signified by
the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> used in Scripture, which the <HI>Sep∣tuagint</HI>
render <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. (3.) The Imperial Crown
and Globe of <HI>Rupertus Imp.</HI> who was of this Family,
richly adorned with pretious Stones. (4.) An ex∣cellent
and well-digested Collection of antient and
modern Coins and Medals of all sorts, in which the
Prince himself is very knowing. Among the rest we
could not but take notice of a <HI>Swedish</HI> Doller of
Copper, about the bigness and of the figure of a square
Trencher, stamped at the four Corners with the Kings
Image and Arms, of that weight, that if a man be
to receive ten or twenty pound in such Coin, he
must come with a Cart and Team of Horse, to carry
it home. The Prince Palatines Name and Titles
are <HI>Carolus Ludovicus, Comes Palatinus Rheni, sacri
Romani Imperii Elector, utrius{que} Bavariae Dux.</HI> He
speaks six Languages perfectly well, <HI>viz. High-Dutch,
Low-Dutch, English, French, Italian</HI> and <HI>Latine,</HI> is
greatly beloved of his Subjects of whom he hath
a paternal Care, and whose Interest he makes his
own.</P>
<P>In the great Church where the famous Library
was kept, we observed many fair Monuments of
Princes of this Family, some with <HI>Dutch,</HI> most with
<HI>Latine</HI> Epitaphs or Inscriptions: Others in the <HI>Fran∣ciscans</HI>
Church. In S. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church also a great
number of Monuments of learned men of the Uni∣versity;
which is of good account and one of the best
in <HI>Germany.</HI> Three or four Colleges there are built
and endowed chieflly for the maintenance and accom∣modation
of poor Students.</P>
<P>The Government of this University is by a Senate,
which consists only of 16 Professors. The number
<PB N="85" REF="52"/>
of Professors is limited, and their Stipends fixt by
the Statutes of the University given them by their
Founder <HI>Rupertus</HI> Count Palatine <HI>Anno</HI> 1346. and
confirmed by the Pope and Emperor. Of these Pro∣fessors
three are of <HI>Divinity;</HI> four of <HI>Law;</HI> three of
<HI>Medicine,</HI> and six of <HI>Philosophy.</HI> Of the Philosophy
Professors four only are admitted into the Senate,
lest they should make too great a party. Besides the
Senate chuses anew the Philosophy Professors every
year, and may change them if they please: the other
Professors are chosen for term of life. When one
dies the Senate chuses two and presents them to the
Prince, of which he takes one to succeed in the va∣cant
place. This Senate chuses every year a <HI>Rector ma∣gnificentissimus,</HI>
which is only an Honorary Title con∣ferred
upon some Prince or great person, for he hath
no power at all in the University. (2.) A <HI>Rector ma∣gnifl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI>
out of their own number by major Vote, the
chief Officer for power and answerable to our <HI>Vice-chancellour.</HI>
(3.) An <HI>Aedilis</HI> who takes care of the
public Buildings. (4.) A <HI>Praefectus rei vinariae.</HI> (5.) A
<HI>Praefectus rei frumentariae,</HI> which Officers answer to
our <HI>Taxers.</HI> (6.) A <HI>Quaestor,</HI> who gathers up the
University Revenue and Rents. Further this Senate
is a Jurisdiction by themselves, and have absolute
power in criminal Causes extending to Life and
Death: only after Sentence given the Prince may
pardon. The Degrees conferred here are in Philo∣sophy
<HI>Masters,</HI> of which lately there have been but
few created; in Law and Medicine <HI>Licentiates</HI> and
<HI>Doctors;</HI> in Divinity <HI>Batchelors, Licentiates</HI> and <HI>Do∣ctors,</HI>
of which last there have been but few lately.
They confer Degrees without any regard of Stand∣ing.
The Candidate must undergo a double <HI>Exa∣men.</HI>
(1.) By the Faculty wherein he is to commence,
the <HI>Rector magnificus</HI> being present, and if he be found
unsufficient he is remitted, and appointed a certain
time to study to prepare himself. (2.) By all the
<PB N="86" REF="53"/>
Professors together, the <HI>Rector magnificus</HI> being also
present. The first they call <HI>Examen tentatorium,</HI> the
second <HI>rigorosum.</HI> Having past both <HI>Examens</HI> he is
to dispute publicly <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b Praeside,</HI> then to make a Le∣cture
in the Faculty wherein he is promoted, and
lastly a Speech. The Speech ended, he asks the Vice-chancellour,
<HI>ut det facultatem promotori ipsum promo∣vendi.</HI>
Note that by the Statute the <HI>Praepositus Eccle∣siae
Wormatiensis</HI> is perpetual Chancellour, and sub∣stitutes
a Vice-chancellour in his place. But now
this is only done <HI>pro forma,</HI> for the University is not
obnoxious to the Chancellour. The Vice-chancellour
granting leave, the Promoter, who is usually the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note, that the Profess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs in each Faculty take the Deanship by turns, though the <HI>Senate</HI> may ap∣point any other.</NOTE> Dean of the Faculty, in the name of the Prince
Elector, and by the leave of the Vice-chancellour,
pronounces such an one Doctor, and bids him
ascend <HI>in superiorem cathedram,</HI> then kisses him,
puts a Ring on his Finger, and a Cap on his Head,
and gives him a Book first shut and then open. Then
the Graduate takes an Oath touching with his Fin∣ger
the two Beadles Staves set leaning one against
the other, and last of all feasts the Professors in the
room called the <HI>Prytancum,</HI> which is now used as the
Divinity-Schools: At which Feast the Prince him∣self
is present or sends the Marshal of his House.
To save Charges two or three Candidates, if they
be of meaner condition, get to be promoted toge∣ther.</P>

<P>The Prince Elector is absolute in his own Terri∣tory.
He can make Laws and repeal them, treat
with forein Princes, sending Embassadors to them,
and receiving Embassadors from them, make War
and Peace, impose Tributes arbitrarily on his Sub∣jects
without the consent of the States of the Coun∣trey.
The Emperor hath nothing to do with his
Subjects, they swearing Allegiance only to him.
He only can excommunicate, having reserved to
himself the Episcopal Power. The Prince Elector
hath seven Councils or Courts, (1.) <HI>Concilium Au∣gustum</HI>
or his Privy Council. (2.) <HI>Concilium Statûs.</HI>
(3.) <HI>Concilium Ecclesiasticum,</HI> consisting of four, where∣of
two are Lay men, and two Clergy. (4.) <HI>Dica∣sterium,</HI>
who judge Causes between man and man.
(5.) <HI>Concilium feudale.</HI> (6.) <HI>Concilium redituum
temporalium</HI> or <HI>rationum.</HI> (7.) <HI>Concilium redituum
<PB N="92" REF="56"/>
Ecclesiasticorum.</HI> The Prince hath thought fit to keep
these two last distinct, partly that he may know how
to proportion the Ministers Allowance; and partly
that if any of his Successors should happen to change
his Religion (as is ordinary for Princes to do in <HI>Ger∣many</HI>)
they may be able to distinguish clearly be∣tween
their own proper Temporal and the Church
Revenue.</P>
<P>The Prince in his own Territory is general Bishop
and supreme Head in Ecclesiastical Affairs. Formerly
this Countrey was under the Inspection and Juris∣diction
of the Bishop of <HI>Spier,</HI> but since the Refor∣mation,
the Prince hath not only seized the Reve∣nues
of the Church into his own hand, but also as∣sumed
to himself entirely the Episcopal Power and
Jurisdiction. He also is universal Patron, and dis∣poses
of all vacant Benefices as he pleases; indeed
the Council of four nominate and present two unto
him, of which usually he chuses one, because it may
well be presumed that he knows not so well as they
what persons are best qualified and fit to be preferred;
but he is not obliged to confer the Benefice upon ei∣ther
of the persons by them so nominated, but may
either put in another known to himself, or com∣mand
them to nominate others, if he like not those
presented. The Religion of the Countrey is the
Reformed. The whole Palatinate is divided into
three <HI>Praefècturae,</HI> and some, <HI>viz.</HI> the greater of these
subdivided into less. Every <HI>Praefectura</HI> hath its In∣spector
or Bishop, who is Pastor of some Church in
that <HI>Praefectura:</HI> He differs not from any other in
any Jurisdiction, but in that commonly he hath a
larger Stipend. His business is only to give Infor∣mation,
if he be of a lesser Division, to the Inspector
of the whole <HI>Praefectura</HI> under which he is, if of a
greater, to the Council of foar. If need be every
<HI>Praefectura</HI> or great Town hath a Presbytery. The
Presbytery of <HI>Heidelberg</HI> consists of the five Ministers
<PB N="93" REF="56"/>
of the City, two Deputies from each Jurisdiction
except the <HI>Aulica:</HI> and two from each Quarter of
the City; so that at this time the number in all is
21. These all have equal Suffrages the Lay-men
with the Ministers, only one of the Ministers always
presides in his Course. This Presbytery assembles
once every week, at whose meeting is always pre∣sent
a Delegate from the Prince, to see that nothing
be agitated there which it concerns not the Presby∣tery
to meddle withal. This Presbytery hath no
power to excommunicate or inflict any Church Cen∣sure;
but if any person be accused to them of any
Crime, they send him to the Jurisdiction to whom
he appertains, to enquire into his Offence. The
Court having received this Information from the
Presbytery, either neglect it if they please, or if they
see cause enquire into it, and punish the Delinquent
according to his Demerit, and in the close of the
Sentence or Warrant for execution add this Clause,
<HI>Quod ad Scandalum Ecclesiae datum remittimus te ad
Presbyterium.</HI> Now at last, all they can do, is to
exact of him a public Confession before the Church,
and a promise of Amendment for the future. As
for Ordination, it is given by the Council of four by
Imposition of Hands, after examination of the per∣son
to be ordained, and Testimonials exhibited from
the University or other Persons of known Credit.
The Prince receives all Tithes, except such as in
some places for conveniencies sake are paid imme∣diately
to the Ministers; and other Church-Reve∣nues,
most whereof is paid out again in Stipends to
the Ministers, which the Prince proportions accor∣dieg
to their Merit and his own Discretion; the rest
is reserved for Emergencies.</P>

from <HI>Heidelberg</HI> we passed in sight of <HI>Philips∣burg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philips∣burg.</NOTE>
a well fortified place situate in a level near the
<PB N="94" REF="57"/>
<HI>Rhene:</HI> now possessed by the <HI>French.</HI> The Castle or
Palace yielded a goodly Prospect. A mile further
we passed through <HI>Graffe</HI> a small Town with a Ca∣stle
belonging to the Markgrave of <HI>Tourlach,</HI> where
our Coachman paid Toll. We lodged this first
night at a Village called <HI>Linknom</HI> under the same
Lord, who is a <HI>Lutheran.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 26. at four miles end we baited at a large
Village called <HI>Raspach;</HI> and two miles on further
we passed through <HI>Stolchoven</HI> a little walled Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stolcho∣ven.</NOTE>
where our Coachman paid another Toll; and after
one mile more another walled Town called <HI>Lichte∣naw,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lichte∣naw.</NOTE>

night we took up our quarters at <HI>Sertz,</HI> a Vil∣lage
under the Earl of <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 27. we passed over the <HI>Rhene</HI> divided into
two Branches or Streams by two great Wooden-Bridges,
which instead of Boards are floored with
whole Fir-Trees laid loose across, neither pinned
nor nailed down: I conceive that the Bridge might
upon any exigent be more suddenly thrown down
and broken. Soon after we were past the Bridges
we entred <HI>Strasburgh.</HI> In this Journey we observed
great plenty of <HI>Maiz</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Wheat planted, in
some places <HI>Lathyrus sativus,</HI> and in others <HI>Cartha∣mus</HI>
or bastard Saffron sown in the fields: Grow∣ing

<P><HI>Strasburgh</HI> is a free City of the Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stras∣burgh.</NOTE> large,
well built, rich and populous, encompassed with a
double Wall and Trench full of Water, besides
the advantage of a good situation in a large Level,
very exactly fortified, and the Walls and Works
most regular, elegant, and scrupulously kept in
repair: so that it seems no easie thing by force to
take this City; neither was it I think once attempted
<PB N="95" REF="57"/>
in the late <HI>German</HI> Wars. It lies as a Block in the
<HI>Frenchmens</HI> way, and is as it were the Rampart of
the Empire in these parts. The Government is by
a greater Council of 300, chosen by the several Com∣panies
of Citizens, and a lesser of 71, of which num∣ber
six are <HI>Burgomasters,</HI> six <HI>Stetmasters,</HI> 15 <HI>Patres
Patriae</HI> and 13 of the <HI>Militia.</HI> The Women of this
City are well-favoured and of good Complexions.
The Inhabitants are most part <HI>Lutherans,</HI> who have
seven Churches: some <HI>Papists,</HI> who have one
Church and four Cloisters, two for Men and two
for Women; and a few <HI>Reformed,</HI> who yet are not
allowed a Church in Town, but forced to go some
two miles to Church in the Territory of the Earl of
<HI>Hanaw.</HI> This City is an Episcopal See, the Bishop
whereof is Lord of the lower <HI>Alsatia.</HI> He hath a
Palace in the City, but is not suffered to lodge therein
above three days together; in an Inn he is allowed
eight days at a time. Here is the fairest, largest, best
furnished, and handsomeliest kept Armory or Arse∣nal
that we saw in <HI>Germany,</HI> or in all these respects
any where else. Here are also public Granaries,
Wine-Cellars and Store-houses. The River <HI>Elle</HI> runs
through the Town. The <HI>Domo</HI> or Cathedral Church
is a fair Building of Stone, having a great pair of
Brass Folding-Doors at the West end. Herein we
viewed the famous Clock described by <HI>Coryat</HI> and
others, a Piece of excellent Workmanship, made,
as were told by one <HI>Isaac Habrechtus</HI> of <HI>Strasburgh.</HI>
The Steeple of this Church is curiously built of
carved Stone, and incomparably the highest that
ever we yet saw. The number of Steps from the
bottom to the top is 662. We ascended 640 Steps
to the place called the Crown, from whence we had
a wide Prospect of the Countrey round about.
In this Steeple two men watch constantly by day and
four by night.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sowre∣bourn.</NOTE> Ten hours distant from <HI>Strasburgh</HI>
towards <HI>Stutgard</HI> is <HI>Sowrebourn,</HI> from whence acid

their Wine and drink as at other places. By the In∣habitants
of this and other Imperial Cities, especially
the Women, are many different sorts of Habits
used.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 31. we left <HI>Strasburgh</HI> and began our Jour∣ney
towards <HI>Basil,</HI> travelling as far as <HI>Tivelsheim</HI> a
Village under the Bishop of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> some two
miles and half▪ <HI>August</HI> 1. after three miles riding
forward we passed through a small walled Town be∣longing
to the same Bishop called <HI>Marklesheim.</HI> Two
miles further we rode in sight of <HI>Brisach,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brisach.</NOTE> a Town
seated on a Rock by the <HI>Rhene</HI> side, a place of great
Strength and Importance, much contended for in
the late Wars. It is now in the <HI>French</HI> hands, as
is all <HI>Alsatia</HI> almost to the Walls of <HI>Basil:</HI> and after
two other miles we came to a Village called <HI>Lode∣sheim</HI>
pleasantly situate in a large Plain where we
lodged.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 2. we rode but one league and an half ere
we arrived at <HI>Basil.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil.</NOTE> This City is large and fair,
the Houses being for the most part built of Stone,
tall and painted on the out side. It is compassed
about with a double Wall and Trench, rich and po∣pulous,
built upon Hills, so that which way soever
you go you either ascend or descend. The River
<HI>Rhene</HI> divides it into two parts, which are joined
together by a Bridge of 14 Arches. That part on
the North side of the River is called <HI>Little Basil.</HI>
There are said to be 300 Fountains in this City,
scarce a Street or House of note but hath one. It
is one of the thirteen Cantons of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and
hath in its Territory about 100 Villages. It gives
Title to a Bishop chosen by Canons, who yet is
not suffered to lodge in the Town one night. He
lives at <HI>Broudint,</HI> keeps the State of a Temporal
Prince, and coins Money, which is not current in
<HI>Basil.</HI></P>

As to the Civil Government, the Citizens are di∣vided
into 15 Tribes or Companies. Each Compa∣ny
chuses 12 men by major Vote, who are called
<HI>Sexers,</HI> because six of them only are regent at once,
<HI>viz.</HI> one six one year, and the other six the next,
and so alternately. These twelve <HI>Viri</HI> or <HI>Sexers</HI>
chuse out of each Tribe two Tfunff-Masters or <HI>Tri∣buni
Plebis</HI> for their Lives. The <HI>Tribuni Plebis</HI> chuse
two out of each Tribe who are called <HI>Senators.</HI> Of
these 60 and the four Heads (two whereof are called
Burgomasters and chosen by the Senators properly
so called, and two <HI>Tribuni Plebis</HI> or <HI>Tfunft-meisters</HI>
and chosen by the <HI>Tribuni Plebis</HI>) the lesser Council
consists. Both Burgomasters and <HI>Tfunft-meisters,</HI>
Tribunes and Senators rule alternately. The old
Senators, or that half of the lesser Council which
was in power the precedent year, do first debate and
agree upon any business of moment before it be pro∣pounded
to the new Senate; who afterwards con∣firm
or reject as they please. The Great Council
(which is assembled by the ordinary Council upon
weighty occasions) consists of all the Magistrates,
<HI>viz.</HI> The 12 <HI>Viri</HI> and all the lesser or ordinary
Council. The lesser Council Judges in criminal
Causes.</P>

<P><HI>August</HI> 10. from <HI>Basil</HI> we set forward for <HI>Zurich.</HI>
At the end of one <HI>Dutch</HI> mile we passed <HI>Augst,</HI> sup∣posed
to have been <HI>Augusta Rauracorum.</HI> There we
view'd the Ruines of an antient Building, judged
by <HI>Amberbachius</HI> to have been an <HI>Amphitheater.</HI> Next
we rode fast by a wall'd Town on the <HI>Rhene</HI> subject
to the Archduke of <HI>Inspruck.</HI> On the Hills here∣about
we first saw Fir-trees growing wild. Then
we passed through <HI>Bruck</HI> a pretty little walled Town
having one handsom Street well built with tall
Houses of Stone, and Fountains in the middle, and
lodged at the Baths of <HI>Baden</HI> six miles distant from
<HI>Basil.</HI> This day we first took notice of the little
green Tree-Frogs. The Baths here are said to be
sixty in number, but small; the Water is very hot.
<HI>Baden</HI> is a walled Town, seated on the side of a Hill
by the River <HI>Limagus,</HI> about half an <HI>English</HI> mile
distant from the Baths. Here the Delegates of
the thirteen Cantons meet and sit. The poor
People put a Cheat upon Strangers, bringing them
to sell (as they pretend) <HI>fossile Dice,</HI> which they say,
they dig out of the Earth naturally so figured and
marked. But I am well assured, such as they brought
us were artificial Dice, and if they dig'd them out
<PB N="102" REF="61"/>
of the Earth, they first buried them there them∣selves.
From <HI>Baden, Aug.</HI> 11. we rode along by the
<HI>Limagus</HI> on one hand, and fair Vineyards on the
other to <HI>Zurich.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zurich</HI> is pleasantly situate at the end of a Lake
call'd <HI>Zurich</HI>-Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zurich.</NOTE> scarce so big as <HI>Basil,</HI> but I think
more populous. The River <HI>Limagus</HI> which runs
out of the Lake divides it into two almost equal
parts, which are joined together by two Bridges;
one very broad for Carts and Horses to pass over.</P>
<P>The Houses are built of Timber with Clay-Walls,
handsomly painted, many of them four or five Sto∣ries
high. The Streets are narrow but well paved
with Flints and great Pebbles. This City is as well
fortified as the Situation of it will permit, besides
the Wall, being encompassed round with good
Earthworks and Trenches after the modern fashion.
The River <HI>Sele</HI> runs by and gives defence to it on
the South side, and a little lower empties itself into
the <HI>Limagus.</HI> The Citizens are given to Merchan∣dise,
all very busie and industrious. They either
are rich or at least so esteemed, and therefore envied
by their Neighbours of the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion. Here
are no Guards of Soldiers at the City-Gates; no
Strangers examined or searcht either at coming in
or going out. We observed the colour of the Wa∣ter
of the <HI>Zurich</HI>-Sea to be greenish and well ap∣proaching
to that of Sea-water. Afterwards we
found the Water of all the Lakes and Rivers near
the <HI>Alpes</HI> to be of the same colour, at which we
were not a little surprised. For we were wont to
attribute that colour in the Sea-water to the mixture
of Salt that is in it, whereas the Water of these Lakes
and Rivers discovers to the Tast nothing of Salt or
brackish. But afterwards considering that these Wa∣ters
did consist for the most part of Snow dissolved;
and that Snow is supposed to contein good store of
nitrous Salt, we thought it not altogether impro∣bable
<PB N="103" REF="61"/>
that this Colour may be owing to the nitrous
Particles remaining in the Water, though they be not
copious enough to affect our Tast; and it would be
worth the while to distil good quantities of this
Water, to see whether it would leave any Salt be∣hind.</P>
<P>That these Lakes and Rivers do consist for the
most part of Snow-water it is manifest, for that upon
the Mountains (excepting the lower parts of them)
no Rain falls in Winter-time, but only Snow, with
which the higher parts of them are covered to a
great thickness for at least six moneths in the year;
and for that the Rivers that flow from the <HI>Alpes</HI> run
lowest in Winter, and abound most with Water in
the Summer-time; so that sometimes they over∣flow
their Banks in the hottest moneths of the year,
and when no Rain falls▪ as my self can testifie con∣cerning
the River <HI>Rhodanus;</HI> because the Sun at the
season melts the Snow upon the Mountains. Hence
it appears, that their Opinion was not so absurd
who attributed the yearly Increase and Overflowing
of the River <HI>Nilus</HI> to the dissolution of the Snow
upon those Mountains where it hath its first Rise.
Though I do not think this to be the true Cause,
partly because that part of the Earth where those
Mountains lie is so hot by reason of its Situation
under the direct and sometimes perpendicular Beams
of the Sun, that it's not likely any Snow should fall,
much less lie there: chiefly because Travellers gene∣rally
agree, that in most parts of that Climate where
those Mountains lie, there are at that time of the
year great falls of Rain, to which therefore the
Overflowing of <HI>Nilus</HI> is more probably attributed.</P>
<P>The Government of this City is by a greater and
a lesser Council. The lesser Council consists of
50, <HI>viz.</HI> 24 Tribunes or Masters of the Companies
chosen by the twelve Tribes or Companies, into
which the City is divided, two by each Company.
<PB N="104" REF="62"/>
These 24 are called <HI>Zwelvers</HI> because twelve of them
only are regent at once. Twelve Senators, chosen
out of the Companies, one out of each Company
by the greater Council according to our Informa∣tion,
according to <HI>Simler</HI> by the lesser. Six, elected
by the same greater Council as we were informed,
but according to <HI>Simler</HI> by the lesser, out of the
People indifferently where they please; four <HI>Tribuni
nobilium</HI> chosen by the Gentlemen; two <HI>Senatores
nobilium;</HI> and two <HI>Burgomasters</HI> or Consuls chosen
by the Council of 200. The Consuls and half this
Council rule by turns, <HI>viz.</HI> 12 <HI>Zwelvers</HI> and 12 <HI>Se∣nators</HI>
with one Consul one half year and the other
half the next; and this half that rules is called <HI>Con∣cilium
novum.</HI> All the 50 meet every week, and if
any Decree be to be made, it is dated in the presence
of the <HI>Concilium novum &amp; vetus.</HI> All the 50 hear
Civil Causes, <HI>Simler</HI> saith eight chosen by the 50;
and the <HI>Concilium novum</HI> judge in Criminals alone.
The greater Council consists of 200, <HI>viz.</HI> 144 elected
out of the Tribes, twelve out of each Tribe; 18 cho∣sen
by the Noblemen among themselves; 24 <HI>Zwel∣vers;</HI>
4 <HI>Tribuni nobilium;</HI> 2 <HI>Senatores nobilium;</HI> the
6 elected indifferently, and the two Burgomasters.
Why the twelve chosen by the greater Council should
be left out, we know not, and therefore suspect our
Information was not good about the making up the
great Council; but of the 12 out of each Tribe, and 18
out of the Noblemen we are sure. This great Coun∣cil
chuses <HI>Land<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>voghts,</HI> and assembles upon impor∣tant
occasions that concern the whole Common∣wealth.
They elect four <HI>Stadthalters</HI> or Proconsuls
out of the 24 Masters of the Companies; two
<HI>Sekelmasters</HI> or Treasurers either out of the twelve
Senators of the Companies or the twelve Tribunes of
the <HI>Concilium novum.</HI> Half the lesser Council is
chosen every half year at <HI>Christmas</HI> and <HI>Midsummer.</HI>
The <HI>Concilium vetus</HI> goes out, and then the <HI>Concilium
<PB N="105" REF="62"/>
novum</HI> becomes <HI>vetus,</HI> and chuses a new <HI>Concilium

again.</P>

This Town is well-built, (the Houses being most of
Stone) walled about and intrencht. It hath two
fair Streets handsomly paved, besides many other
small ones. Here as at <HI>Zurich,</HI> the Citizens when
they walk abroad wear their Swords. As to the
Civil Government, the Citizens are divided into
twelve Tribes or Companies. Each Tribe chuses
two <HI>Tribuni Plebis,</HI> and these 24 make the lesser
or ordinary Council. The great Council consists of
these and sixty more, chosen also by the Companies,
each Company chusing five. The Father and Son,
or two Brothers cannot be together of the Council.
By the greater Council are chosen yearly two Con∣suls
or Burgomasters, two Quaestors, one Proconsul,
and one <HI>Aedilis,</HI> but for the most part they chuse the
same. All Causes Civil and Criminal are tried be∣fore
the lesser Council. Every one of the twenty

<P>This Town is also famous for the Resistance it
made to the <HI>Suedish</HI> Forces commanded by <HI>Horn,</HI>
besieging of it <HI>Anno</HI> 1598. vid. <HI>Galeazzo.</HI></P>
<P>Yet it seemed to me but slenderly fortified, having
toward the Water only a Wall, and toward the
Land an earthen Rampart or Wall and Ditch drawn
at a good distance from the Stone-Wall. It hath
indeed advantage by its Situation, having a Lake
on one side and a fenny Level on the other.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 15. we took Boat, and crossed the <HI>Bodenzee</HI>
from <HI>Constance</HI> over to <HI>Lindaw,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lindaw.</NOTE> and by the way had
a fair Prospect of the strong Town of <HI>Oberlingen.
Lindaw</HI> standeth in the middle of the Lake envi∣ron'd
with Water. It is joined to the Land by a
Bridge of 290 paces, one half of it being Stone,
and the other (that is that next the Town) Wood,
<PB N="107" REF="63"/>
which may upon occasion easily be taken down and
removed. This City besides its natural Strength by
reason of its Situation, is also artificially fortified
with stout Walls and Bulwarks standing in the Wa∣ter,
that side most which is nearest the Land. On
that side toward the Lake are many Rows of great
Stakes driven into the ground, to hinder the ap∣proach
of any Boat or Vessel to the Town. So that
a man would think this place impregnable. The
Streets and Houses are not so spatious and fair as
those of <HI>Constance,</HI> yet proper enough: Several
Fountains also there are in the Streets. Towards
the <HI>Bodenzee</HI> are two Walls, and between the Walls
a large vacant space of Land wherein Vineyards are
planted, of the Grapes whereof are said to be made
yearly 100 Fudders, that is 300 <HI>English</HI> Hogsheads
of Wine. Eight Villages belong to this City, their
Territory extending about three hours.</P>
<P>For Plants we found not far from <HI>Lindaw</HI> in the
mountainous Woods, <HI>Erica procumbens herbacea,
Scahiosa latifolia rubro flore, Gentiana Asclepiadis fo∣lio,</HI>
and in the moister places <HI>Vlmaria major sive Barba
capri, &amp; Lactuca montana purpuro-caerulea major</HI> C. B.
In the moist Meadows <HI>Pneumonanthe</HI> plentifully.
On the Banks of a small River running into the <HI>Bo∣denzee</HI>
near <HI>Lindaw, Myrica sylv. altera Clus.</HI> In
the moist and fenny places near the Lake both here
and at <HI>Constance, Gratiola vulgaris</HI> plentifully.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 17. we rode Post from <HI>Constance</HI> toward
<HI>Munchen</HI> in <HI>Bavaria.</HI> The several Stages where we
changed Horses were (1.) <HI>Wangen</HI> a small Imperial
Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wangen.</NOTE> two miles distant from <HI>Lindaw.</HI> (2.) <HI>Laykirk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Laykirk.</NOTE>
another small Imperial Town, two miles further on.
(3.) <HI>Memmingen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Memmin∣gen.</NOTE> a free City of the Empire, and one
of the chiefest of <HI>Suevia</HI> both for Greatness and
Strength. The Streets are broad, Water running
through them. (4.) <HI>Mundelheim</HI> a small Town under
the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mundel∣heim.</NOTE> where we lodged. (5.) <HI>Lans∣berg,</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="64"/>
a pretty Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lans∣berg.</NOTE> with a handsom Fountain in
the Market-place built in 1663. four <HI>German</HI> miles
from <HI>Mundelheim.</HI> From hence we rode through
no considerable Town till we came to <HI>Munchen,</HI> pas∣sing
by the <HI>Ammerzee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ammer∣zee <HI>Lake.</HI></NOTE> a great Lake about three <HI>Ger∣man</HI>
miles in length, where we had the <HI>Alps</HI> or
some very high Mountains in Prospect.</P>
<P>All Strangers that enter <HI>Munchen</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Munchen</NOTE> are first strictly
examined at the Gate, their Names sent in to the
the Governour, and they deteined till the return of
the Messenger with leave for their Admission. This
City is very strongly walled and fortified, and for
the bigness of it is the most splendid and beautiful
place we have seen in all <HI>Germany,</HI> so that well
might <HI>Cluverius</HI> term it <HI>omnium Germanicarum pul∣cherrimam.</HI>
The Streets are broad and streight, a∣dorned
with sumptuous Churches and Cloisters, and
stately Houses. Above all the Dukes Palace deserves
Respect, not to say Admiration, it being the most
magnificent and sumptuous Edifice for a House, that
we have any where hitherto seen beyond the Seas.
In the great Garden of this Palace we saw many
rare Plants, among the rest we especially took no∣tice
of the <HI>Aloe-trees</HI> (for so I may well call them
for the Greatness and Highth of their Stalks which
shoot up in one year) of which there were more, I
verlly think, in this one Garden than in all <HI>Europe</HI>
besides; I mean of such as came to Stalk and Flower.
In this City so far remote from our native Countrey
it seemed strange to us to find a Cloister of <HI>English</HI>
Nuns. We thought it worth noting that the Bodies
of the Churches here are filled with Pews and Seats,
as ours in <HI>England,</HI> whereas generally in the Chur∣ches
of the <HI>Roman</HI>-Catholics there are no fixed Seats,
or but very few; the People either standing to hear
their Sormons, or sitting on moveable Benches and
Stools; that so when the Sermon is ended the Body
of the Church may be again cleared. Having view∣ed
<PB N="109" REF="64"/>
<HI>Munchen,</HI> the nearness of <HI>Augsburgh</HI> invited us
thither, where we arrived <HI>August</HI> 21. having pas∣sed
by the way a pleasant little Town belonging to
an Abby of <HI>Bernardines</HI> called <HI>Pruck;</HI> and after that
a little walled Town seated on a Hill, called <HI>Frid∣berg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Augsburgh</HI> is a great City about eight miles in
Compass,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augs∣burgh.</NOTE> well walled and trenched about, standing
upon the River <HI>Lech;</HI> The Houses for the most part
well-built, the Streets adorned with several stately
Fountains: The Armory comparable to that of <HI>Stras∣burgh,</HI>
consisting of twelve Rooms filled with Arms
and Weapons of all sorts; The Stadthouse next to
that of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> the fairest and most stately of any
we have yet seen; in which there is one upper Room
or Chamber very large and high-rooft, paved with
Marble, richly gilt and painted both Roof and Walls,
and in all respects scarce to be parallel'd. The Ci∣tizens
are divided between <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Lutherans,</HI>
these latter being esteemed double the number of the
former; yet have they seven Cloisters of Men and
five of Women, whereof one <HI>English.</HI> Very few
Reformed here. This is a free City of the Empire
and governed by its own Magistrates. It seems to me
at present for the bigness not very populous, and is, I
believe, somewhat decayed, and short of what it hath
been, both as to Riches and Multitude of Inhabitants:
which may be attributed to the Losses and Injuries
i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> susteined in the late Wars. In a large Plain not
far from <HI>Augsburgh,</HI> over which you pass going
thence to <HI>Munchen,</HI> we observed many rare Plants,
<HI>viz. Tithymalus verrucosus, Trifolium pratense album

<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 28. we departed from <HI>Augsburgh,</HI> and being
loth to leave behind us unseen so considerable a City
as <HI>Nurenberg,</HI> which <HI>Cluver</HI> calls <HI>Germanicarum su∣perbissimam,</HI>
we bestowed three days on a Journey
almost directly backwards to see it. The first day,
after the Riding of six <HI>German</HI> miles we crossed the
<HI>Danow</HI> over a Wooden Bridge to <HI>Donavert,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Donavert</NOTE> a prett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="111" REF="65"/>
Town belonging to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> where we
lodged. The second being the 29. of <HI>August</HI> we pas∣sed
through two walled Towns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon∣haim.</NOTE> <HI>viz. Monhaim</HI> and
<HI>Papenhaim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Papen∣haim.</NOTE> and lodged at <HI>Weissenbergh</HI> an Imperial
Town of some note, the Inhabitants whereof are
all <HI>Lutherans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Weissen∣bergh.</NOTE> it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive miles distant from <HI>Donavert.</HI>
Nigh this Town is a strong Fort built upon a Hill,
belonging to the Marquess of <HI>Anspach,</HI> who is also
a <HI>Lutheran.</HI></P>
<P>The third day being the thirtieth, we passed
through a small walled Town called <HI>Pleinfeldt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plein∣feldt.</NOTE> and
at three miles distance we rode close beside another
walled Town called <HI>Rotte,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rotte.</NOTE> under the Marquess of
<HI>Anspach,</HI> and after two hours riding more through
Woods of Pine, we arrived at <HI>Nurenberg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nuren∣berg.</NOTE> which
City we found to answer if not exceed our Expecta∣tion;
it being the most stately and best built that
we have seen in <HI>Germany.</HI> The Houses are for the
most part of Free-Stone, and were they but as uni∣form
as those of the <HI>Low-Countrey</HI>-Towns, <HI>Nuren∣berg</HI>
would not for Beauty give place to any of them.
Besides it is rich, populous, and for bigness I think
not inferiour to the best in <HI>Germany,</HI> though I am
not ignorant that in this last respect some give <HI>Collen,</HI>
some <HI>Erfurt</HI> the Preeminence. It hath under it a large
Territory, comprehending above 100 Towns and Vil∣lages.
The Countrey round about is barren and san∣dy▪
and the City far distant from the Sea, and standing
upon but a small River; notwithstanding which Dis∣advantages,
by the Industry of the people, it is become
one of the best traded and most potent Towns in <HI>Ger∣many.</HI>
The Inhabitants are for the most part <HI>Luthe∣rans;</HI>
they seemed to us in the Ornaments of their
Churches and manner of their Worship more to sym∣bolize
with the <HI>Roman-Catholics</HI> than any other
People of that Profession we had then observed. The
<HI>Papists</HI> are allowed a small Church within the Walls,
but the <HI>Reformed</HI> none. The great <HI>Piazza,</HI> the
<PB N="112" REF="66"/>
<HI>Stadt-house</HI> and other public Buildings deserve re∣membrance.
This Town wants not for Walls and
Ditches, being every way well fenced and fortified.
Finally, it is an Imperial City or Free Common∣wealth,
being governed by a Senate and Magistrates
of its own: but of the Model or Form of Govern∣ment
for want of good Acquaintance, we could not
get a perfect account.</P>
<P><HI>As for Plants, we found no great variety near the
City, but by the way we came from</HI> Augsburgh, <HI>we
observed in several Woods near</HI> Papenhaim, Caryo∣phyllus
flore tenuissimè dissecto <HI>C. B. Not far from</HI>
Weissenberg, Draba lutea siliquis strictissimis <HI>C. B.</HI> Gen∣tianula

like to our</HI> Meadow Saxifrage, <HI>but taller and larger,
An</HI> Seseli pratense <HI>Lob.?</HI></P>
<P><HI>September 3.</HI> from <HI>Nurenberg</HI> we began our Jour∣ney
to <HI>Ratisbone</HI> or <HI>Regensberg.</HI> This day we pro∣ceeded
no further than <HI>Aldtdorf,</HI> a little walled
Town and an University belonging to the <HI>Nuren∣bergers,</HI>
where there is a pretty Physic-Garden. This

History of the Founding of this University.</P>

<P>In the College are mainteined 36 Students at the
Charges of the City of <HI>Nurenberg,</HI> which also pays
the Professors their Stipends. The Degrees confer∣red
here are Doctor of Law, Physic and Poetry,
Batchelour of Divinity and Master of Arts. As for
Plants there is a double Catalogue put out by
Dr. <HI>Mauritius Hofman:</HI> one of such as are nursed up
and preserved in the Physic-Garden: the other of
such as grow wild near the Town; in the compo∣sing
of which he seems to have taken much pains,
so that I believe this Catalogue is very full and
exact.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Hofman</HI> shewed us several <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI>
or Serpent-Stones and some petrified Cochle and
Muscle-shells found in the Fields and Hop-Gardens
near <HI>Altdorf,</HI> of which we our selves the day fol∣lowing
as we travelled from thence to <HI>Nieumarkt,</HI>
in some fields we passed through, observed, and ga∣thered
up good store. Of these kinds of Bodies, I
shall here take leave by way of digression to discourse
a little: And first I shall make a particular enume∣ration
of some of the most remarkable places where
they have been found, as well in <HI>England</HI> as beyond
the Seas, partly of my own Observation, partly
out of good Writers. Secondly, I shall give the Opi∣nions
<PB N="114" REF="67"/>
of the best Authors concerning the Original
and Production of them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> First then those places of <HI>England</HI> which afford plen∣ty
of these petrified Shells are (1.) <HI>Whithy</HI> or <HI>Whitebay</HI>
in the North Riding of <HI>York-shire,</HI> where (as <HI>Camden</HI>
relates in his Description of that Country) Lapides <HI>in∣veniuntur
serpentum in spiram revolutorum effigie, naturae
ludentis miraculum.—Serpentes olim fuissê crederes
quos lapideus cortex intexisset.</HI> Besides these Serpent-Stones
which he alone mentions, we found there
both upon the Shores and in the rocky Cliffs by the
Sea-side petrified Muscles and <HI>Belemnites</HI> in great
plenty. (2.) <HI>Huntley-nabb,</HI> on the same Coast, not
far from <HI>Whitby</HI> to the Northwards, where (as the
<HI>same Camden</HI> relates) upon the Shores under the Cliffs
lie Stones <HI>varia magnitudine tam affabrè sphaericâ

place I never was, but upon the Shore at <HI>Whitby,</HI>
I observed many of this kind of Balls, that is, Ser∣pent-stones
crusted over with or enclosed in another
Stone, as in their Case or <HI>Matrix,</HI> and leaving there∣in
when broken, their Impression, but none of that
exact sphaerical roundness he mentions, but rather
of a lenticular figure. (3.) <HI>Alderley</HI> in <HI>Glocester∣shire</HI>
mentioned by the same Author in his Descri∣ption
of that Country. <HI>Ad fontes</HI> Avon <HI>fluvioli</HI> (saith he)

(4.) Kinesham</HI> or <HI>Cainsham</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> not far
from <HI>Alderley,</HI> so called (saith <HI>Camden</HI>) from <HI>Keina</HI>
a holy <HI>British</HI> Virgin, <HI>quam serpentes in lapides mutasse
superioris aevi credulitas multis persuasit, eò quòd ejusmodi

in circumferentia prominuit, extremâ cauda centrum
occupante.</HI> Of these Serpent-Stones we saw several
sorts here, and some of that extraordinary bigness,
that (as I remember) they were about a Foot in Dia∣meter.
(5.) <HI>Farnham</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> mentioned by Dr.
<HI>Merret</HI> in his <HI>Pinax.</HI> (6.) <HI>Richmond</HI> in <HI>York-shire</HI>
mentioned by <HI>Camden.</HI> Beside which places my
self and Friends have seen and gathered of them at
<HI>Lyme</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire, Adderbury</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> (which
doubtless thence had its name) about five miles di∣stant
from <HI>Banbury, Bricksworth</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI>
and in several places near <HI>Daventry, Verulam</HI> in
<HI>Hartfordshire, Shukborough</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire.</HI> And
which is most strange, Mr. <HI>Eyre</HI> of <HI>Highlooe</HI> in the
<HI>Peak</HI> of <HI>Derbyshire</HI> shew'd us a great lump of them
amassed together by a Cement as hard as Marble,
found in that mountainous Countrey; And Mr. <HI>Mar∣tin
Lister</HI> assures us that there are store of them
found in <HI>Craven</HI> the most mountainous and craggy
part of <HI>York-shire:</HI> and in a Discourse of his con∣cerning
them, published in the <HI>Philosophical Tran∣sactions,</HI>
Numb. 76. pag. 2283. he mentions for them
<HI>Adderton</HI> in <HI>York-shire,</HI> thence denominated, <HI>Wansford</HI>
Bridge in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> and <HI>Gunthrop</HI> and <HI>Beau∣voir.</HI>
Castle in <HI>Lincoln</HI> and <HI>Nottingham-shires.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these petrified Shells there are found in
several places of <HI>England</HI> other congenerous Bodies,
viz. <HI>Star stones,</HI> by some called <HI>Astroites;</HI>
by <HI>Boetius
de Boot, Asterias vera seu Lapis stellaris;</HI> by <HI>Gesner,
Sphragis Asteros;</HI> by <HI>Fer. Imperat. Stella Judaica.</HI>
(2.) S. <HI>Cuthhert</HI>'s Beads or <HI>Trochites</HI> and (3.) Cap-Stones
or <HI>Echinites,</HI> called by Naturalists <HI>Lapides
brontioe.</HI> Of the <HI>Glossopetrae</HI> I have not yet heard that
there have been any found in <HI>England,</HI> which I do
not a little wonder at, there being Sharks frequently
taken upon our Coasts.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="68" MS="y"/>
1. Of those they call Star-Stones (because they run
out into five Angles like so many Rays as they use
to picture Stars with) there are found at <HI>Shukborough</HI>
in <HI>Warwick-shire</HI> and <HI>Cassington</HI> near <HI>Glocester,</HI> where
we also have gathered of them. <HI>Camden</HI> mentions
a third place, that is <HI>Beauvoir</HI>-Castle in <HI>Lincolnshire,
sub quo</HI> (saith he) <HI>inveniuntur Astroites lapides, qui
stellas invicem connexas repraesentant, in quibus radii
eminent singulis angulis quini, &amp; singulis radiis cavitas
media subsidet.</HI> We have had them also sent us out
of <HI>York-shire,</HI> but remember not where they were ga∣thered.</P>
<P>II. Those they call S. <HI>Cuthhert</HI>'s Beads are found
on the Western shore of the s <HI>Holy Island.</HI> This last
Summer [1671.] <HI>Tho. Willisell</HI> discovered them in
the Chinks of the Stones in the bottom of the Cha∣nel
of the River <HI>Tees,</HI> which parts <HI>York-shire</HI> and the
Bishoprick of <HI>Duresine.</HI> These are round and not
angular like the Star-Stones. Both (if they be
owing to the Sea) seem to be the <HI>Spinoe dorsales</HI> or
Tail-Bones of Fishes petrified, they consisting for
the most part of several Plates or Pieces sticking to∣gether
like so many <HI>vertebrae,</HI> though I confess the
particular Pieces are shorter or thinner than the Ver∣tebres
of any Fish I have as yet observed.</P>
<P>III. The <HI>Echinites</HI> or <HI>Brontiae</HI> are found scattered
all over <HI>England</HI> of several magnitudes and shapes.
I have not heard of any Bed of them or great num∣ber
found in one place. Beyond the Seas we have
(besides the place which gave occasion to this Dis∣course)
found of them at <HI>Brescia</HI> in <HI>Lombardy</HI> on the
sides of a Hill adjoining to the City: upon the
Banks of the River <HI>Tanaro</HI> in <HI>Piedmont</HI> four miles be∣low
<HI>Aste,</HI> but most plentifully in the Island of <HI>Malta,</HI>
where we also saw great store of <HI>Glossopetrae</HI> or
Sharks Teeth petrified of all sorts and sizes.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Glossopetroe, Boetius de Boot</HI> lib. 2. cap. 168.
saith they are found in the Sands near <HI>Daventer</HI> in
<PB N="117" REF="68"/>
<HI>Overyssel,</HI> and in the Alum-Mines near <HI>Lunenburgh</HI>
in <HI>Germany. Goropius Becanus</HI> in <HI>Orig. Antverp. l. 3.</HI>
saith that they are often digged up in the Ditches
about <HI>Antwerp;</HI> and found in so great plenty in a
Hill near <HI>Aken</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> that he thinks it a good
Argument to prove that they could not be the Teeth
of Sharks: <HI>In colle illo qui Aquisgrano imminet tantum
id genus piscium fuisse qúis crederet quantum de Glosso∣petrarum
copia conjectari deberet.</HI></P>
<P>For petrified Cochles and other Sea-Shells, <HI>Geo.
Agricola</HI> saith there are found of them in the Stone-Quarries
of <HI>Galgeberg</HI> and those beyond Mount
<HI>Maurice</HI> in the Territory of <HI>Hildesheim</HI> in <HI>Saxony;</HI>
and sometimes in the new part of the City itself in
digging of Cellars and in the Town-Ditch, (2.) At
<HI>Alfeld</HI> in the same <HI>Saxony</HI> between the Watch-Tower

<P>Besides all which places and others mentioned by
Writers I doubt not but in <HI>Italy, Germany, France,
England</HI> and the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> there are many not
taken notice of where these Bodies might be found,
were diligent Search and Observation made. That
they have not been discovered or taken notice of in
other parts of <HI>Europe</HI> and in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> is cer∣tainly
to be attributed to the Negligence and Rede∣ness
of the People who mind nothing that is curious,
<PB N="120" REF="70" MS="y"/>
or to the want of learned Writers who should com∣municate
the Histories of them to the World.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="II"/> I come now to give an account of the Opinions of
the best Authors concerning the Original and Pro∣duction
of these Stones.</P>
<P>The first and to me most probable Opinion is that
they were originally the Shells or Bones of living
Fishes and other Animals bred in the Sea. This
was the general Opinion of the Antients, insomuch
that <HI>Steno</HI> saith, It was never made a Question
among them, whether such Bodies came from any
place else but the Sea. It hath of late times and is
now received and embraced by divers learned and
ingenious Philosophers, as in the precedent age by
<HI>Fracastorius,</HI> and in the present by <HI>Nicolaus Steno</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Robert Hook,</HI> after whom I need name no
more to give it countenance and authority in the
World. In his <HI>Micrographia,</HI> Observ. 17. He thus
discourses concerning these Bodies. Examining
some of these very curiously figured Bodies (found
about <HI>Keinsham,</HI> which are commonly thought to
be Stones formed by some extraordinary <HI>plastic</HI> Vir∣tue
latent in the Earth itself) I took notice of these
particulars.</P>
<P>First, that these figured Bodies were of very dif∣fering
Substances as to hardness: some of Clay,
some Marl, some soft Stone, almost of the hardness
of those Stones, which Masons call Fire-Stone,
others as hard as <HI>Portland</HI> Stone, others as hard as
Marble, and some as hard as a Flint or Crystal.</P>
<P>Next, they were of very differing Substances as
to Transparency and Colour; some white, some
almost black, some brown, some metalline or like
Marcasites, some transparent like white Marble,
others like flaw'd Crystal, some gray, some of divers
colours; some radiated like those long <HI>petrified drops,</HI>
which are commonly found at the <HI>Peak</HI> and in other
subterraneous Caverns, which have a kind of Pith
in the middle.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="70"/>
Thirdly, that they were very different as to the
manner of their outward Figuration: for some of
them seem'd to have been the Substance that had filled
the Shell of some kind of Shell-fish; others to have
been the Substance that had conteined or enwrapped
one of these Shells, on both which the perfect impres∣sion
either of the inside or outside of such Shels seem'd
to be left, but for the most part those impressions seem∣ed
to be made by an imperfect or broken Shell, the
great end or mouth of the Shell being always wanting
and oftentimes the little end and sometimes half,
and in some there were Impressions, just as if there
had been Holes broken in the figurating, imprinting
or moulding Shell: some of them seem'd to be made
by such a Shell very much bruised or flaw'd, inso∣much
that one would verily have thought, that very
figured Stone had been broken or bruised whilst a
Gelly as 'twere, and so hardned, but within the
Grain of the Stone there appeared not any sign of
any such bruise or breaking, but only on the very
uttermost Superficies.</P>
<P>Fourthly, they were very different as to their
outward covering, some having the perfect Shell
both in Figure, Colour and Substance sticking on
its surface, and adhering to it, but might very easily
be separated from it, and like other common <HI>Cochle</HI>
or <HI>Scallop</HI>-shells, which some of them most accurately
resembled, were very dissoluble in common Vinegar:
others of them, especially those <HI>serpentine</HI> or <HI>helical</HI>
Stones, were covered with or reteined the shining
or pearl-coloured Substance of the inside of the Shell,
which Substance on some parts of them was exceed∣ing
thin, and might very easily be rubbed off; on
other parts it was pretty thick, and reteined a white
Coat or flaky Substance on the top, just like the sides
of such Shells: some of them had large pieces of
the Shell very plainly sticking on to them, which
were easily to be broken or flaked off by degrees:
<PB N="122" REF="71"/>
they likewise some of them reteined all along the
surface of them very pretty kind of Sutures, such as
are observed in the Skulls of several kinds of living
Creatures, which Sutures were most curiously shaped
in the manner of Leaves, and every one of them in
the same Shell exactly one like another; which I
was able to discover plainly enough with my naked
eye, but more perfectly and distinctly with my Mi∣croscope:
All these Sutures I found by breaking
some of the Stones to be the <HI>Termini</HI> or boundings
of certain <HI>Diaphragms</HI> or partitions, which seemed
to divide the Cavity of the Shell into a multitude of
very proportionate and regular Cells or Caverns:
these Diaphragms in many of them I found very
perfect and complete, of a very distinct Substance
from that which filled the Cavities, and exactly
of the same kind with that which covered the out∣side,
being for the most part whitish or <HI>mother of-Pearl</HI>
coloured.</P>
<P>As for the Cavities between those <HI>Diaphragms,</HI> I
found some of them fill'd with Marl, and others
with several kinds of Stones, others for the most
part hollow, only the whole Cavity was usually
covered over with a kind of <HI>Tartareous petrified</HI> Sub∣stance,
which stuck about the Sides, and was there
shot into very curious regular Figures, just as <HI>Tartar</HI>
or other dissolved Salts are observed to stick and
<HI>crystallize</HI> about the sides of the conteining Vessels;
or like those little <HI>Diamants,</HI> which I before obser∣ved
to have covered the vaulted Cavity of a Flint;
others had these Cavities all lined with a <HI>metalline</HI>
or <HI>Marcasite-like</HI> substance, which I could with a
<HI>Microscope</HI> as plainly see most curiously and regularly
figured, as I had done those in a Flint.</P>
<P>From all which and several other particulars
which I observed, I cannot but think, that all these,
and most other kinds of stony bodies which are found
thus strangely figured, do ow their Formation and
<PB N="123" REF="71" MS="y"/>
Figuration not to any kind of <HI>Plastic Virtue</HI> inherent
in the Earth, but to the Shells of certain Shell-fishes,
which either by some Deluge, Inundation,
Earthquake or some such other means came to
be thrown to that place, and there to be filled
with some kind of Mud or Clay, or <HI>petrifying</HI> Wa∣ter
or some other Substance, which in tract of time
hath been setled together and hardned in those shelly
Moulds into those shaped Substances we now find
them; That the great and thin end of these Shells,
by that Earthquake, or whatever other extraordi∣nary
cause it was that brought them thither, was
broken off; and that many others were otherwise
broken, bruised and disfigured; that these Shells
which are thus spirallied and separated with Dia∣phragms,
were some kind of <HI>Nautili</HI> or <HI>Porcelane-Shells;</HI>
and that others were Shells of <HI>Muscles,
Cochles, Periwinkles, Scallops,</HI> &amp;c. of various sorts;
that these Shells in many from the particular nature
of the conteining or inclosed earth or some other
cause, have in tract of time rotted and mouldred
away, and only left their Impressions both on the
conteining and conteined Substances; and so left
them pretty loose one within another, so that they
may easily be separated by a knock or two of a ham∣mer.
That others of these Shell-fishes according to
the nature of the Substances have by a long continu∣ance
in that posture, been petrified and turned into
the nature of Stone. That oftentimes the Shell
may be found with one kind of Substance within and
quite another without, having perhaps been filled
in one place and afterwards translated to another,
which I have very frequently observed in <HI>Cochle,
Muscle, Periwincle,</HI> and other Shells, which I have
found by the Sea-side. Nay further, that some parts
of the same Shell may be filled in one place, and some
other Caverns in another, and others in a third or
a fourth or a fifth place, for so many differing Sub∣stances
<PB N="124" REF="72" MS="y"/>
have I found in one of the petrified Shells,
and perhaps all these differing from the encompassing
Earth or Stone: The means how all which varieties
may be caus'd, I think will not be difficult to conceive,
to any one that has taken notice of those Shells, which
are commonly found on the Sea-shore: And he
that shall throughly examin, several kinds of such
curiously form'd Stones, will (I am very apt to think)
find reason to suppose their generation or formation
to be ascribable to some such Accidents as I have
mentioned, and not to any <HI>Plastic Virtue.</HI> For it
seems to me quite contrary to the infinite prudence
of Nature, which is observable in all its works and
productions, to design every thing to a determinate
end, and for the atteining that end makes use of
such ways as are (as far as the knowledge of man
has yet been able to reach) altogether consonant and
most agreeable to mans reason, and of no way or
means that doth contradict or is contrary to human
ratiocination; whence it has a long time been a ge∣neral
Observation and <HI>Maxim,</HI> that <HI>Nature doth no∣thing
in vain:</HI> it seems I say contrary to that great
wisdom of Nature, that these prettily shaped Bodies
should have all those curious figures and contrivan∣ces
(which many of them are adorn'd and contriv'd
with) generated or wrought by a <HI>Plastic Virtue,</HI> for
no higher end than only to exhibit such a form;
which he that shall throughly consider all the circum∣stances
of such kind of figured Bodies, will I think
have great reason to believe, though I confess one
cannot be able presently to find out what Natures
designs are. Thus far Mr. <HI>Hook.</HI> And <HI>Steno</HI> agrees
exactly with him, and is far more positive and con∣fident;
For (saith he) that these Shells were once
the parts of Animals living in a fluid, though there
never had been any testaceous marine Creatures, the
very view of the Shell itself evinceth, as may be
evident by the instance of <HI>bivalve Cochle-shells.</HI> Con∣cerning
<PB REF="73"/>
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="4 pages" DISP="〈4 pages missing〉"/>
<PB N="129" REF="74"/>
these Shells his Observations and Discourses
are very consonant with Mr. <HI>Hook</HI>'s. One or two
particulars not yet mentioned, which may further
confirm this Opinion, I find in him, <HI>viz.</HI> (1.) That
there was found a Pearl-bearing Shell in <HI>Tuscany,</HI>
a Pearl yet sticking to the Shell. (2.) A piece of
the greater Sea-nacre [<HI>Piuna marina</HI>] in which the
silk-like substance within the Shell being consumed,
the colour of that substance did remain in that earthy
matter which had filled the Shell. (3.) That about
the City of <HI>Volterra</HI> there are many beds of earth not
stony, which do abound with true Cochle-shells
that have suffered no change at all, and yet they
must needs have lain there above 3000 years; whence
it is evident, that part of <HI>Tuscany</HI> was of old time
covered with the Sea, and why then might not as
well all those other places where these petrified Shells
are found.</P>
<P>Against this Opinion lie two very considerable
and material Objections, which I shall heer pro∣pound.</P>
<P>First, it will hence follow that all the Earth was
once covered by the Sea, and that for a considerable
time: for there being found of these Shells in the
middle of <HI>Germany,</HI> at least 200 miles distant from
any Sea, as my self can witness, nay, upon the high∣est
Mountains of <HI>Europe,</HI> even the <HI>Alps</HI> themselves,
(as may be proved by sufficient Authority) the Sea
must needs have covered them, and consequently,
the water keeping its level, all <HI>Europe</HI> and the World
besides. Now that ever the Water should have co∣vered
the Earth to that highth as to exceed the tops
of the highest Mountains, and for a considerable
time abode there, is hard to believe, nor can such
an Opinion be easily reconciled with the Scripture.
If it be said that these Shells were brought in by
the universal Deluge in the time of <HI>Noah,</HI> when the
Mountains were covered. I answer, that that De∣luge
<PB N="126" REF="75"/>
proceeded from Rain, which was more likely
to carry Shells down to the Sea, than to bring any
upwards from it. But because some may argue from
what the Scripture saith, [<HI>The fountains of the great
deep were broken up,</HI>] that the Deluge proceeded part∣ly
from a breaking forth and overflowing of the Sea,
and consequently might bring in these Shells: To
that I answer, that had it been so, such a Flood
would have been more likely to scatter such Shells
as it brought in indifferently all over the surface of
the Earth, than to lay them in great beds in particu∣lar
places: such beds seem to have been the effect of
those Animals breeding there for some considerable
time. If it be said, that those Mountains where such
Shells are found might at first have been low places,
and afterwards raised up by Earthquakes, that seems
not likely, because they are found upon so many
Mountains, unless it be said, that all Mountains
were at first so raised, and then the former difficulty
will recurr, and it will follow, that before the rai∣sing
of the first Mountains, the whole Earth was
covered by the Sea. Besides, this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> seems
to me in itself improbable, for that though there be
mention made in Histories of some such Mountains
raised by Earthquakes, yet they are but very few and
of no considerable highth or greatness, compared
with those chains of high and vast Mountains, the
<HI>Alps, Pyrenees, Appennine, Taurus, Caucasus, Imaus,
Haemus, Atlas,</HI> &amp;c. In general since the most anti∣ent
times recorded in History, the face of the Earth
hath suffered little change, the same Mountains,
Islands, Promontories, Lakes, Rivers still remain∣ing,
and very few added, lost or removed. Whence
it will follow, that if the Mountains were not from
the beginning, either the World is a great deal older
than is imagined or believed, there being an incre∣dible
space of time required to work such changes as
raising all the Mountains, according to the leisurely
<PB N="127" REF="75"/>
proceedings of Nature in mutations of that kind
since the first Records of History: or that in the
primitive times and soon after the Creation the earth
suffered far more concussions and mutations in its
superficial part than afterward.</P>
<P>II. Among these petrified Shells are many sorts,
which are not at this day that we know of any where
to be found; nay some proceed so far as to affirm,
that there is not the like to any one of these supposed
petrified Shells to be found among our present Shell-fishes.
If it be said, that these Species be lost out
of the World: that is a supposition which Philo∣sophers
hitherto have been unwilling to admit,
esteeming the destruction of any one Species to be a
dismembring the Universe and rendring it imper∣fect,
whereas they think the Divine Providence is
especially concerned to preserve and secure all the
Works of the Creation. Yet granting that some few
Species might be lost, it is very unlikely that so many
should, and still more unlikely that such as were so
diffused all over <HI>Europe</HI> and found in so many places;
but most of all that a whole <HI>Genus,</HI> of which there
were so many several Species, and those scattered in
so many distinct and from each other remote places,
should be so utterly extinct and gone, at least out of
our Seas, that there should not one in an age be found.
Such are for example the <HI>Serpentine</HI> Stones or <HI>Cornua
Ammonis</HI> supposed originally to have been <HI>Nautili,</HI>
of which I my self have seen five or six distinct Spe∣cies,
and doubtless there are yet many more. Add
heerunto the greatness of some of these Shells, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> whereof there are found of about
a foot Diameter, far exceeding the bulk of any Shell-fish
now breeding or living in our Seas.</P>
<P>The second Opinion is of those who imagine
these bodies to have been the effects and products of
some Plastic power in the Earth; and to have been
formed after the manner of Diamants and other pre∣tious
<PB N="128" REF="76"/>
Stones, or the Crystals of coagulated Salts, by
shooting into such figures. Of these bodies my
very ingenious and learned Friend Mr. <HI>Martin Lister</HI>
discourses in a Letter of his inserted in the <HI>Philosoph.
Transact.</HI> Numb. 76. to this purpose, upon occasion
of Mr. <HI>Steno</HI>'s <HI>Prodromus.</HI> We will easily believe,
that in some Countries, and particularly along the
shore of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, there may all manner
of Shell-fishes be found promiscuously included in
rocks or earth, and at good distances too from the
Sea. But for our <HI>English</HI> inland Quarries, which
also abound with infinite numbers and great varieties
of Shells, I am apt to think there is no such matter
as petrifying of Shells in the business (or as <HI>Steno</HI> ex∣plains
himself, Pag. 84. in the <HI>English</HI> version <HI>&amp; alibi,</HI>
that the substance of these Shells formerly belonging
to Animals, hath been dissolved or wasted by the
penetrating force of Juices, and that a stony substance
is come in the place thereof) but that these Cochle∣like
Stones ever were as they are at present, <HI>Lapides
sui generis,</HI> and never any part of an Animal. That
they are so at present is in effect confessed by <HI>Steno</HI>
in the above-cited page; and it is most certain, that
our <HI>English</HI> Quarry-shells (to continue that abusive
name) have no parts of a different texture from the
Rock or Quarry they are taken, that is, that there
is no such thing as Shell in these resemblances of
Shells, but that Iron-stone Cochles are all Iron-stone,
Lime or Marble all Lime-stone and Marble, Spar or
Crystalline Shells all Spar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that they never
were any part of an Animal. My Reason is, that
Quarries of different Stone yield us quite different
sorts or Species of Shells, not only one from another
(as those Cochle-stones of the Iron-stone Quarries
of <HI>Adderton</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> differ from those found in
the Lead-Mines of the neighbouring Mountains, and
both these from that Cochle-Quarry of <HI>Wansford</HI>-Bridge
in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> and all thee from those
<PB N="129" REF="76"/>
to be found in the Quarries about <HI>Gunthorp</HI> and
<HI>Beauvo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI>-Castle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) but I dare boldly say from any
thing in Nature besides, that either the Land, salt
or fresh Waters do yield us. 'Tis true that I have
picked out of that one Quarry of <HI>Wansford</HI> very re∣semblances
of <HI>Murices, Tellinae, Turbines, Cochleae,
&amp;c.</HI> and yet I am not convinc'd, when I particularly
examined some of our <HI>English</HI> Shores for Shells, as
also the fresh Waters and the Fields, that I did ever
meet with any one of those Species of Shells any
where else but in their respective Quarries, whence I
conclude them <HI>Lapides sui generis,</HI> and that they
were not cast in any Animal mould whose Species or
race is yet to be found in being at this day. Thus
far Mr. <HI>Lister.</HI> The like Argument also <HI>Goropius
Becanus</HI> uses to prove that these Bodies are not petri∣fied
Shells. <HI>Scallop-shells</HI> (saith he) are so rare upon
the shores of <HI>Flanders,</HI> that they are brought thither
by Pilgrims from the coast of <HI>Gallicia</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and
shown for strange things; and yet in the ditches
about <HI>Antwerp</HI> there is such plenty of them, that in
digging there they throw up heaps of them like little
mountains, so that he that would gather of them
need not take the pains to travel to <HI>Gallicia,</HI> or so
much as to the Sea-shores. To these he adds ano∣ther
Argument which yet to me seems of little force.
In some places about <HI>Antwerp</HI> digging for water,
they meet with in the earth a crust or Layer of two
foot thickness and in some parts thinner, wholly
made up of Sea-shells, whereas there was never
found such a Mass of Shells upon any of the Sea-shores;
so that no man can reasonably assert that
they were thrown up by the Sea and there left, the
waters receding and forsaking them; for then with∣out
question we should hear of the like heaps or beds
of them found on the coasts of <HI>Holland, Zealand</HI> and
<HI>Flanders</HI> But to this I answer that the reason why
at this day there are not such beds of them to be
<PB N="130" REF="77"/>
found upon the shores, may be, because they are ga∣thered
up and carried away by men, partly out of
curiosity, partly to burn for lime or other ways to
make use of. Besides we know that in the bottom
of the Sea, these Shell-fishes many times lie in great
beds, and there breed in great abundance, and it
is not altogether unlikely, that the Sea might
on occasion suddenly recede and desert such beds,
and they afterwards come to be buried in the Earth.</P>
<P>But to argue further in defence of this Opinion.
There are found in the earth many such like figured
Stones which we know not whither to refer, as re∣sembling
neither any part of an Animal, nor of a
Plant: Such are those that Naturalists call <HI>Lapides
Ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>curii, Belemnites, Lapides Judaivi, Trochites,
As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eriae</HI> and others, to which if there be at present
any Shells, Bones, Fruits, Roots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> like, I am
as yet wholly to seek for them. And if there are
now no such things in being, they that defend the
contrary Opinion must have recourse to that gratu∣itous
supposition that such Species are lost out of the
World.</P>
<P>Besides I have been told by a person of good cre∣dit
of a Stone of this nature resembling a Cochle-shell
found in the stomach of a Beef; where in all
likelihood it must be bred and shoot into that figure;
which if true, there can be no reason to doubt, but
those in the Stone-Quarries and other places are so
generated.</P>
<P>A third Opinion there is, that some of these
bodies are really Shells petrified, or the cases of such
bodies or their contents: and that others of them
are stones of their own kind resembling such Shells,
so shaped and figured by some Plastic power. That
Shells may be and are sometimes petrified (as are
also Bones and Wood) cannot be denied, and I my
self have gathered such upon the Sea-shore; and on
the other hand, he that asserts that there are bodies
<PB N="131" REF="77"/>
naturally growing in the earth, which do imitate
Sea-shells, delivers himself from the trouble of an∣swering
the Arguments which urge the contrary
opinion. But yet methinks this is but a shift and
refuge to avoid trouble, there not being sufficient
ground to found such a distinction. For my own
part I confess I propend to the first Opinion, as
being more consonant to the nature of the thing,
and could wish that all external arguments and obje∣ctions
against it were rationally and solidly answered.</P>

<HI>Sept.</HI> 4. we proceeded on our journey to <HI>Ratis∣bone,</HI> and passed through <HI>Nieumarkt,</HI> a little walled
town belonging to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P>5. We passed through <HI>Heinmaw</HI> a small walled
town subject to the Duke of <HI>Neuburg,</HI> and at night,
passing the River <HI>Danow,</HI> by a fair Stone-Bridge,
we entred <HI>Ratisbone</HI> or <HI>Regensberg</HI> so called from
the River <HI>Regen,</HI> which heer falls into the <HI>Da∣now.</HI></P>
<P>This City is large and well built (the houses be∣ing
for the most part of stone) adorned with many
fair palaces of noble men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Regens∣berg <HI>or</HI> Ratisbon</NOTE> well walled about and
fortified. The streets are but narrow. The roofs
of the houses are not built so steep as at <HI>Augsburgh,
Nurenburgh, &amp;c.</HI> or as ours in <HI>England,</HI> but flattish
after the <HI>Italian</HI> made. The <HI>Diet</HI> of the <HI>Empire</HI> is
usually held heer, it being an Imperial City, and
governed by its own magistrates, though in the
D. of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s countrey. This city hath a Bishop,
who is of the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, but he hath little
to do, all the magistrates and the greatest part of
the Inhabitants being <HI>Lutherans.</HI> Yet some cloi∣sters
there are of Monks and Nuns, and a college of
<HI>Jesuits.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the rocks not far from <HI>Ratisbone</HI> a little be∣low
the town on the other side the river we found,
besides many of the rarer sort of our <HI>English</HI> plants,
<HI>Asclepias flore albo. Daucus montanus Apii folio
major</HI> C. B. <HI>Apium montanum nigrum</HI> J. B. <HI>Caucalis
Peucedani folio</HI> Ger. as I take it: It hath a fine leaf,
a small root (which I believe yearly perishes) reddish
stalks, an umbel of white flowers, to which suc∣ceed
small round seeds with purple <HI>apices: An Dau∣cus
montanus Apii folio, flore luteo</HI> C. B? It hath wing∣ed
leaves like to <HI>Bipennella</HI> but larger, the several
wings of each leaf being as large as and like unto
the intire leaf of the said <HI>Bipennella;</HI> a great root,
but not hot; in tast as the Burnet-Saxifrages are; the
<PB N="137" REF="80"/>
stalk riseth up to the highth of a man almost; the
seeds are round, striate, covered with a hoary down,
reddish toward the top, and of a hot spicy tast. <HI>Ti∣thymalus

which I suppos, was sown there.</P>
<P><HI>Septemb.</HI> 10. we hired a Boat for <HI>Vienna:</HI> First,
on our left hand as we went down the river, we
passed by a little village and a castle standing on a
hill, called <HI>Thonastan.</HI> About three miles and half
below <HI>Regensberg</HI> we passed in sight of <HI>Wert,</HI> a castle
belonging to the Bishop of <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> seated on a
hill by a river called <HI>Wisent,</HI> which heer runs into
the <HI>Danow.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strau∣bing.</NOTE> This night we lodged at <HI>Straubing,</HI> a
very handsom, pleasant, walled Town, belonging
to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> five miles below <HI>Ratis∣bone.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 12. in the morning we past <HI>Pogen</HI> where is
a Church standing on a high hill. Four miles below
<HI>Straubing</HI> we rowed under a wooden bridge which
<PB N="138" REF="81"/>
there crosses the <HI>Danow.</HI> Heer on the left hand as
one goes down, stands <HI>Dreckendorf,</HI> a walled town
belonging to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> A little further
off we passed by the mouth of the river <HI>Iser.</HI> Then
we had a prospect of <HI>Osterhoven</HI> on our left hand, and
not far thence a small village called <HI>Hofkirchen,</HI> and
on the same side still a little castle called <HI>Hilkersberg,</HI>
where the shores along the river began to be rocky.
This night we lodged at a pretty little walled
town built of stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vilsho∣ven.</NOTE> called <HI>Vilshoven,</HI> belonging to
<HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 13.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Passaw.</NOTE> At four miles distance from <HI>Vilshoven</HI> we
came to <HI>Passaw,</HI> a considerable city for its strength
and greatness, formerly well built with many fair
stone houses. But about three quarters of a year
before our being there, a most dreadful Fire burnt
down, ruin'd and destroy'd almost the whole Town,
Churches, public buildings and all. It is situate
just at the confluence of the rivers <HI>In</HI> and <HI>Danow,</HI>
and subject to the Archduke of <HI>Inspruck,</HI> who, we
were told, gave 50000 dollars towards the rebuild∣ing
of it. Heer is a bridge over the river <HI>In</HI> to a
town called <HI>Instat.</HI> Hitherto the river <HI>Danow</HI> flow∣ed
gently down, but below <HI>Passaw,</HI> it began to be
streightned by hills on both sides and to run with a
swifter stream. Seven miles from <HI>Passaw</HI> we passed by
<HI>Nayhonse</HI> castle, and this third night lodged at a
pretty little village belonging to the Emperor called
<HI>Asch,</HI> standing on the right side of the river.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 14. we had an open countrey again, no hills
being near the river. At four miles end we landed
at <HI>Lintz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lintz.</NOTE> and viewed the city, which we found to
be a very elegant place, well built with stone hou∣ses
flat rooft after the <HI>Italian</HI> fashion; having a large
square <HI>Piazza</HI> with two fountains in it, and on the
highest part a fair palace of the Emperor, whence
there is a pleasant prospect of the <HI>Danow</HI> and Coun∣trey
adjacent. About three miles below <HI>Lintz</HI> we
<PB N="139" REF="81"/>
passed a pretty village on our left hand, called <HI>Mal∣hausen.</HI>
Then we had a prospect of a town on our
right hand situate upon the river <HI>Ens</HI> called <HI>Intz.</HI>
Seven miles below <HI>Lintz</HI> are hills again on both sides
the river. Heerabouts is a village called <HI>Greine,</HI>
where the Earl of <HI>Lichtenstein</HI> hath a house situate
on a hill. Below <HI>Greine</HI> on the left hand is a little
village, where we past a dangerous place in the river
called <HI>Strom,</HI> where the stream being streightned by
hills on each hand runs very swiftly, and besides is
full of rocks: a little further below a rock, which
jets a good way out into the river, we passed a vio∣lent
whirtl-pool called the <HI>Werble.</HI> At some distance
further on the left hand stands a small village under
a high hill, half whereof fell down about two years
before our being there, which made so great a noise
that it was heard two <HI>German</HI> miles off, at <HI>Ips,</HI> a
little town we passed by on the right hand. We lod∣ged
this fourth night at a small village called <HI>Mor∣pach,</HI>
11 miles from <HI>Lintz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 15. in the morning we went by a rich cloi∣ster
called <HI>Melk</HI> on our right. At six miles distance
from our lodging we passed a fair house of the Earl
of <HI>Dernstein</HI>'s on our left hand, and heerabout had
a prospect of <HI>Ketwein</HI> a rich Abby strongly situate on
a hill, attempted by the <HI>Swedes</HI> without succchess.
About nine miles from <HI>Marbach</HI> we passed under a
wooden bridge by a little walled town called <HI>Stein,</HI>
where the <HI>Swedes</HI> (they told us) were notably beaten
and driven out again after they had entred the town;
which repulse they afterwards revenged, when they
took the place, by plundering and spoiling it. Not
far hence we landed to view <HI>Krembs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Krembs.</NOTE> a considerable
city seated on the side of a hill, well-built, walled
about and trenched towards the river. From hence
we came into an open countrey, and the river being
at liberty, the chanel grew much wider. Six miles
below <HI>Krembs</HI> we passed by a small walled Town oh
<PB N="140" REF="82"/>
the right hand called <HI>Deuln;</HI> then we had the pro∣spect
of <HI>Greitenstein,</HI> a castle situate on a hill at some
distance from the river on the left hand; next we
had a sight of <HI>Cornberg,</HI> a wall'd town in a plain
not far from the <HI>Danow;</HI> taken by the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the
late wars and by them notably defended against the
Emperor. Heer and afterward at several other pla∣ces
we observed mills built upon two boats, the
wheel lying between the boats, which are fixed at
a convenient distance one from another, and so the
stream coming between the boats, and by reason it
is streightned by degrees, running more swiftly,
turns the wheel. One of the boats is by strong cables
or chains at each end fastned to the bank, and so
the boats, mill and all rise and fall with the water.
About a mile and half before we reach'd <HI>Vienna</HI> we
went by a fair rich Abby called <HI>Claisternaiberg,</HI> with
a little wall'd town of the same name; and at the
end of 19 <HI>German</HI> miles, which the swiftness of the
current assisting us, we made this day, we arrived at
<HI>Vienna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vienna.</NOTE> the chief city of <HI>Austria,</HI> and at present the
imperial seat, so called from the river <HI>Wien</HI> which
runs into the <HI>Danow</HI> no the East side of the Town.
It is for the bigness of it the most frequent and full
of people that we have yet seen beyond the seas. The
wall is not above four or five <HI>English</HI> miles in cir∣cuit,
but there are large Suburbs at a little distance
from the town, those houses that were very near
being lately pull'd down to clear the wall and works
for fear of a Siege: The <HI>Tures</HI> at the time of our
being there having taken <HI>Neuhausel,</HI> and news com∣ing
that they were marching with their whole army
towards <HI>Presburg</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> not above 40 <HI>English</HI>
miles distant from <HI>Vienna.</HI> This City is regularly
and strongly fortified with a high and impenetrable
wall of earth faced with brick, a broad and deep
trench, into which they can (as they told us) when
they please draw the water; Bastions, half-moons
<PB N="141" REF="82"/>
and horn-words, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that it is justly reputed one
of the strongest holds of Christendom. The inner
wall, which was said to be built with the ransom of
<HI>Richard.</HI> I. King of <HI>England,</HI> is of little strength or
consideration in comparison with the new and outer
one. The houses are sufficiently tall and well built
of stone, the roofs flattish after the <HI>Italian</HI> mode:
The streets rather narrow than broad; the markets
well stored with all necessaries. Heer we first met
with tortoises to be sold, at the rate of six pence
apiece: they are found in muddy ditches in these
parts. Heer also we first took notice of the fruit
of <HI>Sorbus legitima;</HI> and first saw in the fish-markets
the <HI>Silurus</HI> or Sheat-fish, the greatest of all fresh∣water
fish that we have seen, some of them weighing
above 100 pound. The Emperors palace, the Ca∣thedral
church and other public buildings deserve
remembrance were it my design minutely to describe
places. The Emperor is of a mean stature and dark
complexion, thin-visaged, his hair black, his under∣lip
thick and hanging down a little, much like his
effigies on his coin.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants observed about <HI>Vi∣enna.</HI></NOTE> As for plants we found heer∣about,

<P>We hired a coach for <HI>Venice</HI> and began our journey
thitherward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 24.</NOTE> and this night lodged at a great Vil∣lage
called <HI>Trayskerk</HI> four miles distant from <HI>Vienna:</HI>
by the way-side we found store of <HI>Absinthium Austri∣acum
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enuifolium</HI> Clus.</P>
<P>At four miles end we came to <HI>Neustat (Neapolis

of a square figure, mean bigness, handsomly built,
<PB N="142" REF="83"/>
having streight streets and a fair square market-place.
At three of the corners are mounts or bastions, and
at the fourth a Castle. In the layes near this town
I first found <HI>Asperula caerulea.</HI> Two miles beyond
<HI>Neustat</HI> we began to leave the open countrey and to
come among hills. We lodged this night at a village
called <HI>Gluknitz</HI> four miles distant from <HI>Neustat.</HI> The
houses in these villages are for the most part covered
with shingles of wood: the hills clothed with woods
of Pine.</P>
<P>After two miles riding we came to a village cal∣led
<HI>Schadwyen</HI> or <HI>Shadwin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE> seated between the
mountains and enclosed with a gate at each end.
Heer we alighted and our Coachman hired ten oxen
(which stood there ready for that purpose) to draw
his Coach up a steep ascent to the top of the hills
which part <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Stiria.</HI> On the sides and

crost the river. This afternoon we passed through

night took up our loding at <HI>Kimberg</HI> a large village
six long miles distant from <HI>Glocknitz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="83"/>
We travelled along the same valley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE> and passed
through a great village called <HI>Kapsuberg;</HI> besides
many other villages, castles and Gentlemens houses
on the sides of the hills, which we rode near to;
and at three miles end came to <HI>Pruck an der Mure,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pruck an der Mure.</NOTE>
<HI>i. e. Bons Muroe</HI> a fair town for this Countrey, and
walled about, having a large market-place with a
fountain in it. Proaeding on in the same valley
some two leagues further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lewben.</NOTE> we passed <HI>Lewben,</HI> a very
neat, pleasant and well-built walled town, better
than we expected to have found any in this moun∣tainous
Countrey. It hath a fair market-place with
fountains. And we observed much Iron lying in
the streets, which is heer made, and wherewith
the inhabitants drive a great trade. Heer we crossed
the <HI>Mura</HI> twice, and soon after we were past <HI>Lew∣ben</HI>
we rode over a hill, and following the course
of the said river among the mountains, at evening
we came to a village called S. <HI>Michael,</HI> where, we lod∣ged.
We saw in these parts many men and women
with large swellings under their chins or on their
throats, called in <HI>Latin</HI> or rather in <HI>Greec, Broncho∣celt,</HI>
and by some in <HI>English, Bavarian, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kes.</HI> Some of
them were single, others double and treble. This
is a disease which these <HI>Alpine</HI> Nations have of old
been subject to <HI>Quis tumidum guttur miretur in Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plbvs?</HI>
Yet among the <HI>Grisons,</HI> who live on the
highest parts of the <HI>Alps,</HI> I do not remember to have
seen any of these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>I dare say there are not half so
many thereabouts as in these Countries. What
should be the Cause of this evil, whether the drink∣ing
of Snow-water, or water infected with the vi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose
steams and particles of Mercury, or other mi∣nerals
and metals, wherewith in all probability those
mountains abound, is no easie matter to determin.
For on the one hand, in some mountainous coun∣tries,
where the snow lies as long as it doth-heer,
and consequently their waters are little else then
<PB N="144" REF="84"/>
snow dissolved, we shall find very few infected with
this disease: and on the other hand, as few in <HI>Hun∣gary,
Transylvania</HI> and other countries abounding
with mercury and other minerals. We must there∣fore
suspend, till some ingenious Physician of these
Countries, by long and diligent observing what
causes or occasions these Tumours, and likewise
what prevents and cures them, instructs us bet∣ter.</P>
<P>We also observed in these Countries more Idiots
and delirous persons than any where else; which
we imputed sometime to the snow-water, sometime
to the inordinate eating of Cabbage, of which in
all the market-towns we saw monstrous heaps lying
to be sold. But upon further consideration I think
with <HI>Palmarius,</HI> it ought rather to be attributed to
the mineral steams that infect their waters, espe∣cially
Mercurial. For we see the vapour of Quick∣silver
doth principally affect the brain and nervose
parts, begetting palsies and <HI>deliriums</HI> in Painters,
Gilders. Miners and those that are much conversant
about it.</P>
<P>We travelled on by the river <HI>Mures</HI> side to <HI>Knittle∣field,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">28. Knittle∣field.</NOTE>
a walled town three miles from S. <HI>Michael,</HI> and
then proceeding along the same valley, we passed by
some Noblemens houses and castles, and lodged at a

from <HI>Knittefield.</HI></P>
<P>We travelled on in the same valley by the river
<HI>Mure</HI> till we came to <HI>Newmarkt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">29. New∣markt.</NOTE> a little walled

the course of another little river which runs
into the <HI>Dravus</HI> about <HI>Volckmarck,</HI> in a narrow val∣ley
between high hills, and a mile from <HI>Newmarkt</HI>
we came to a considerable wall'd town called <HI>Frei∣sach,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Freisach</NOTE>
in which are four cloisters. A mile further
we came to <HI>Heirt</HI> in <HI>Carinthia</HI> where we lay this

We rode rocky ways through valleys to <HI>S. Veit</HI>

<P>We rode very rugged way among the mountains
and rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Octob. 1.</NOTE> passing the whole length of a Lake called
<HI>Oostsukersey,</HI> and at the further end of it observed a
strong castle seated on a high hill belonging to the
Earl of <HI>Dietrichstein,</HI> a Prince of the Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dietrich∣stein.</NOTE> who
coins money. Then we came down into a pleasant
valley, and so over the river <HI>Dravus.</HI> which is heer
navigable, and runs by the walls of <HI>Villach,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Villach.</NOTE> a well∣built
town and one of the chief of this Countrey,
three miles distant from <HI>Vilkerck.</HI> A good distance
from <HI>Villach</HI> we passed the <HI>Guile,</HI> a considerable river
falling into the <HI>Dravus;</HI> and had very rocky way
among high mountains till we came to <HI>Orlesteina,</HI> a
village where we lodged.</P>
<P>We travelled among high mountains very bad
way to a village called <HI>Klein Tarvis</HI> two miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> and
proceeding on still among the mountains we came
to the river <HI>Timent,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Adriatic</HI>
Sea;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pontieba.</NOTE> and lodged this night at <HI>Pontieba,</HI> the last town
we passed in the <HI>Emperors</HI> countrey, part of it is sub∣ject
to the <HI>Emperor</HI> called <HI>Pontieba Imperiale,</HI> and
part to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> called <HI>Pontieba Veneta,</HI> where
we took a bill of health for <HI>Venice.</HI> Between <HI>Klein
Tarvis</HI> and <HI>Pontieba,</HI> we saw a herd of Goats fol∣lowing
the Goat-herd like so many dogs: in other
places we have seen sheep in that manner following
their shepherd, which no doubt was usual in <HI>Judaea;</HI>
for our Saviour <HI>John</HI> 10. 4. comparing himself to a
shepherd and his disciples and servants to sheep, saith,
<HI>And he goeth before his sheep, and they follow him, for</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="85"/>
Which would have seemed strange to the hearers had the shepherds
been wont only to drive their sheep, as with us they
do.</P>
<P>We past over the river <HI>Timent</HI> by a bridge that parts
<HI>Carinthia</HI> from <HI>Friuli.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> About a <HI>German</HI> mile off we
came to a little fort in a village called <HI>Clausen,</HI> where
are two draw-bridges, which we were not permitted
to pass, till we had delivered our bill of health. Hence
we travelled along by the river, and observed tim∣ber-trees
floted down the stream, and when the
rocks stopped them, men with hooks put them off
and directed them into the force of the current.
This is the manner all over the <HI>Alps</HI> and other high
mountains, they fell trees and get them to any little
current of water and expect a good shot of rain,
and then flote them down to the greater rivers. This
day we passed <HI>Vensonga,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vensongo. Hospita∣letto.</NOTE> a pretty little wall'd town,
and lodged at <HI>Hospitaletto</HI> a large village, where we
got quit of the mountains, and came into the plain
Countrey of <HI>Friuli.</HI></P>
<P>We passed by <HI>Limonia</HI> a wall'd town situate on
the rising of a hill at the foot of the mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Limonia. S. Dani∣ele.</NOTE>
Some miles further we passed S. <HI>Danicle;</HI> then we
forded the river <HI>Timent</HI> in several places. The river
heerabouts in a time of rain or when the snow melts
on the mountains, spreads itself to a very great
breadth, as appears by the empty chanel. Soon af∣ter
we had passed the river, we ascended a cliff and
entred the walls of a little town called <HI>Spilimberg,</HI>
where were rows or cloisters on each side the street
under the houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spilim∣berg.</NOTE> which we after found in many of
the towns of <HI>Lombardy;</HI> ten <HI>Italian</HI> miles further ri∣ding
brought us to S. <HI>Avogio,</HI> a village where we
rested this night.</P>
<P>We rode along the plains and at ten miles end
came to <HI>Saribe</HI> a walled town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Saribe.</NOTE> where the river Li∣venza
<PB N="147" REF="85"/>
divides itself and encompasseth the wall.
From hence we drove on about two <HI>Dutoh</HI> miles and
lodged at <HI>Conegliano,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conegli∣ano.</NOTE> a wall'd Town seated on the
ridge of a hill a place of good account, as is also
<HI>Saribe.</HI></P>
<P>All the way we travelled in <HI>Italy</HI> hitherto we had
little other bread than what was made of <HI>Sorghum,</HI> a
grain the blade whereof arises to seven or eight foot
highth and is as great as ones finger, bearing a
large panicle on the top, the berry or seed being
bigger than that of wheat, and of a dusky co∣lour.</P>
<P>We rode a <HI>Dutch</HI> mile and then ferried over the
river <HI>Anaxus</HI> or <HI>Piave,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> and at ten <HI>Italiam</HI> miles further
come to <HI>Treaviso</HI> a large Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treviso.</NOTE> the head of a Pro∣vince
called <HI>Marea Trevisana,</HI> an important place
for strength, but too near and too obnoxious to <HI>Ve∣nice</HI>
to be rich. From <HI>Treviso</HI> we rode through a
very fertil and well cultivated countrey to <HI>Mestre,</HI> a
little Town by the <HI>Lagnne,</HI>(so they call the Flats
about <HI>Venice,</HI> which are all covered with water
when the Tide is in) where we took boat for <HI>Ve∣nice.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the mountains we passed over this voy∣age,

all over the highest mountains. <HI>Scabiosa argentea an∣gustifolia,</HI>
in the chanels of the torrents in <HI>Friuli:</HI> and
<HI>Galega</HI> by the rivers and ditches every where in <HI>Italy.</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="86"/>
In <HI>Marea Trevisana,</HI> some part of <HI>Friuli,</HI> and
the greatest part of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> we observed the
Corn-fields to be so thick set with rows of trees,
that if a man from an hill or high tower should
look down upon the Countrey at a distance, he
would take it to be a Wood. Against every Tree
is planted a Vine, which runs up the tree, and
the branches of the neighbour-vines they draw
from tree to tree and tie together: So that their
Corn-fields are also Woods and Vine-yards, the
same land sufficing for all these productions, and
not being exhausted with so much spending (as
one would be apt to imagine) by reason of the
depth and richness of its soil. Neither in this
hot Countrey doth the Corn receive any preju∣dice
from the shade or dropping of the Trees,
(which in our colder Climate would quite marr
it) but rather advantage, there falling little rain
in Summer-time, and the Trees keeping off the
scorching Sun-beams, which else might dry up and
wither it; the heat notwithstanding sufficing to
bring the Grain to perfect maturity. Whereas
with us all the Sun we can give it is little enough,
and the very grass which grows under the trees
is sowr and crude: for that usually we have too
little heat for our moisture, and they too much.
This part of <HI>Italy</HI> hath been deservedly celebrated
for fertility, and may justly in my opinion be stiled
the Garden of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OF
VENICE.</HEAD>
<P>VEnice is built upon certain little Islands in the
middle of the Sea, or rather in the middle of
certain Flats or Shallows, covered all over with wa∣ter
at full Sea, but about the City when the Tide
is out in many places bare, called by the <HI>Italians
Lagune.</HI> These <HI>Lagune</HI> are enclosed and separated
from the main <HI>Gulf</HI> or <HI>Adriatic</HI> Sea by a bank of
earth (<HI>il Lito</HI> or <HI>Lido</HI> they call it) extending accor∣ding
to <HI>Contarini</HI> about 60 miles, according to <HI>Le∣ander
Albertus</HI> and others (who come nearer the
truth) but 35, and resemble the space conteined in
a bent Bow, the bow being the shore of the firm
land, and the <HI>Lido</HI> the string. The City stands at
an equal distance from the firm land of <HI>Italy</HI> and
from the <HI>Lito,</HI> viz. five miles from each. This <HI>Lido</HI>
serves as a good fence or rampart to secure the City
and other included Islands against the raging waves
of the Sea in stormy weather. It is discontinued by
seven, say some, say others by five breaks or aper∣tures,
and those not very wide ones, which they
call Ports or Havens, and by which the <HI>Lagune</HI>
communicate with the <HI>Gulf.</HI> Of these Inlets two
only are deep enough to admit any vessels of con∣siderable
bulk or burthen, <HI>viz.</HI> those of <HI>Malamocco</HI>
and <HI>Lio.</HI> Into or not far from the <HI>Lagune</HI> most of
the great rivers of <HI>Italy</HI> empty themselves, <HI>v. g. Padus</HI>

of flouds, bring down with them from the moun∣tains
a great deal of earth and silt, which will, its
probable, in process of time fill up the <HI>Lagune</HI> and
make dry land of them. For I believe at the first
building of <HI>Venice</HI> no part of them lay bare at low
water as now there doth. <HI>Gianotti</HI> saith, that an∣tiently
the City was ten miles distant from the firm
land, the <HI>Lagune</HI> extending as far as <HI>Oriago,</HI> which,
as some think, was so called <HI>quasi Ora lacus;</HI> and
and that all that space between <HI>Oriago</HI> and <HI>Fusina</HI>
(where they now imbark that go from <HI>Padua</HI> to <HI>Ve∣nice</HI>)
had been added to the firm land notwith∣standing
all the endeavours the <HI>Venetians</HI> could
use.</P>
<P>This City was first founded, according to the
best Authors, about the time that <HI>Attila</HI> with his
<HI>Hunnes</HI> invaded <HI>Italy,</HI> burning and destroying all
before him; by some families who seeing no end of
these irruptions of barbarous nations, sought refuge
for themselves in these desolate Islands, in the year
456 or thereabouts. Others make the first begin∣ning
of it to have been before that time in the year
421 or 423. But though in the times of former
irruptions many of the neighbouring people fled
hither to shelter themselves from the present storm,
yet I believe they did not think of settling them∣selves
heer or making these Islands their fixt habi∣tation,
and uniting themselves into one City till the
expedition of <HI>Attila.</HI> Whenever it began, it hath
continued a Virgin-City, (having never been ravish∣ed
nor attempted by any Enemy) since its first
foundation for at least 1200 years, which is more
than any other City of that antiquity, so far as I
have read or heard, can boast of. Yet is it not at
present nor ever was it fortified or so much as wal∣led
about; neither indeed doth it need it, being
sufficiently strong by its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ituation alone, which is
such, that it is not likely for the future ever to be ta∣ken,
<PB N="151" REF="87"/>
unless the Sea quite leave it, and the <HI>Lagune</HI> be∣come
dry land conjoined with the Continent. For
by Sea great ships can come no nearer than the haven
of <HI>Malamocco,</HI> and those apertures in the <HI>Lido,</HI> where
boats and lesser Vessels may enter, are defended by
strong Forts and Castles: besides that every tide the
Chanel doth so vary, that without the guidance of
an expert Pilot they will not be able to find the
way in, but be in danger of being stranded upon
the flats.</P>
<P>This City is in circuit, taking in the <HI>Giudecha,</HI>
eight <HI>Italian</HI> miles. Viewing it from S. <HI>Mark</HI>'s tower
we judged it to be about the bigness <HI>Amsterdam</HI> was
then of. It is divided into two parts by the <HI>Grand
Canale,</HI> which passes through the middle of it in
the form of the letter S. It is also divided into six
parts or regions, called thence <HI>Sestieri;</HI> three on
one side the <HI>Canale,</HI> viz. <HI>Castello,</HI> S. <HI>Marco</HI> and <HI>Ca∣nareio;</HI>
and three on the other side, viz, <HI>San Paolo,
Santa Croce</HI> and <HI>Dorso duro.</HI> It conteins 70 Parishes,
though some make them 72; 67 Monasteries,
whereof 33 of Freres and 34 of Nuns, according
to a survey taken in the year 1581. since which
time, I believe, the number hath been increased.

The Sum total is 134871. <HI>Sansovinus</HI> reckons
the number of souls in his time to have been 180000,
but, I suppose, he takes in <HI>Muran</HI> and the other
Islands, which in this survey are left out. I am not
ignorant that several late writers make the present
number of Inhabitants to be at least 300000, but I
believe they speak at random, and by conjecture,
upon no good grounds; (as I have been often told,
that there are in <HI>Paris</HI> a million and half of people,
whereas it is well if there be half <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> million) there
being no reason to think that the Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is much in∣creased
since <HI>Sansovinus</HI> his time. I find the Sum
total of the number of males to exceed the total of
the number of females in this survey by above 3500,
which comes near to the account of the excess of
males in <HI>England,</HI> given us by Capt. <HI>Graunt</HI> in his
Observations upon the weekly Bills of Mortality in
<HI>London.</HI> And I doubt not but if exact, observations
were made in other places, there would be found
the like proportion between the number of males
and females born into the world in hot countries as
in cold. So that from this Topic the <HI>Asiatics</HI> have
no greater plea for multiplicity of wives than the
<HI>Europeans.</HI> Little chanels of water cross and di∣vide
the city into many Islets, and may rather be
called the Streets of it, than those narrow Lanes or
Alleys (<HI>Calle</HI> they call them) through which you pass
on foot from one place to another. By these cha∣nels
you may convey your self and goods from any
one place of the city to any other, by boat; which
is the only way of carriage, except mens shoulders,
there being neither coach nor litter, cart nor wain,
horse nor ass▪ used or so much as to be seen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eer. For
passage on foot there are built about 450 bridges
cross the chanels, most of them of stone and of one
arch, among which the most famous is that over
the <HI>Canal grande,</HI> called <HI>Ponte di Rialto:</HI> and for
passage by water there are a great number of <HI>Gon∣dalo</HI>'s
<PB N="153" REF="88"/>
and other boats; some say eight, some ten,
some twelve, nay, some fifteen thousand, but I
believe all is conjecture; and they were never num∣bered.</P>
<P>The Buildings are generally tall and fair: the
Palaces of Noblemen thick set all over the City,
but especially upon the <HI>Canal grande,</HI> which though
not vast, are handsom and well-built. The founda∣tions
of the houses are great piles or masts driven
into the ground as at <HI>Amsterdam.</HI></P>
<P>The Arsenal is said to be three miles in circuit,
they that speak modestly allow it but two; well
stored with arms, ammunition and all provisions
for war. Heer the Galleys are made and laid up,
of which the Republic hath (they say) at least 200.
Heer also lies the famous Vessel called the <HI>Bucentoro,</HI>
in which upon <HI>Ascension</HI> day yearly the <HI>Duke</HI> accom∣panied
with the Senators, and attended by some
thousands of <HI>Gondalo's</HI> bravely set out and adorned,
goes forth as it were in solemn procession some two
or three miles to Sea, and casting thereinto a ring,
saith, <HI>I espouse thee in token of perpetual dominion.</HI>
Heer are said to be kept 20000 pieces of Ordnance
great and small, and arms for above 250000 men. A
great number [1550] of Artificers, as Shipwrights,
Carpenters, Smiths, Founders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are constantly
kept at work at the public charge.</P>

<HI>Venice,</HI> according to the old Epithet <HI>Venetia la∣ricca,</HI>
hath been esteemed the richest City, not of
<HI>Italy</HI> only but of all <HI>Europe:</HI> and doubtless was so
before the passage to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> by the <HI>Cape of
good hope</HI> was discovered: when besides a large share
of <HI>Lombardy</HI> the best Countrey of <HI>Italy, Friuli,
Istria</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> the Islands of <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Candia,
Zant, Cephalonia</HI> and <HI>Corfu,</HI> with others in the <HI>Ar∣chipelago</HI>
subject to them, they were chief if not sole
masters of the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade, furnishing the
greatest part of <HI>Europe</HI> with the commodities coming
from thence, which were then brought by Mer∣chants
to <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and there by them
bought up. So that then it was a Proverb in <HI>Italy,
Il bianco e'l negro han fatto ricca la Venetia.</HI> White
and black, <HI>i. e. Cotton</HI> and <HI>Pepper</HI> have made <HI>Venice</HI>
rich. Since the loss of that trade, and by the vast
expences of long wars with the <HI>Tures,</HI> wherein
they came off losers at last, having parted with first
<HI>Cyprus</HI> and lately <HI>Candia</HI> to them, their treasures, I
believe, are well exhausted. Yet the riches of pri∣vate
persons must needs be great, the City having
never been sackt nor having ever undergone any
such change of Government as that one considerable
party of the people hath been oppressed and their
goods confiscate. And though the public be not so
rich as it hath been, yet will it soon recover itself
and grow wealthy again upon the enjoyment of
Peace and free Commerce. Though the wings of
this Common-wealth have been a little clipt, yet

<P>This City is well served with all provisions of
Victuals, especially fish and wild-fowl. Fresh water
they have none but what is brought from land;
and rain water which they preserve in cisterns, and
which serves well enough for the ordinary uses of
the house. The Air is very sharp in Winter-time
<PB N="156" REF="90"/>
by reason of its vicinity to the <HI>Alps. Venice</HI> is no∣ted
for the best Treacle; the best both drinking and
looking-Glasses, made at <HI>Muran</HI> a large Burgo or
Town, about three miles in circuit, and divided in
the middle by a broad chanel like <HI>Venice,</HI> in an Island
about a mile distant from the City, so that it may
pass for a Suburb of it: for Paper, for Turpentine,
for Needle-work Laces called Points; and if that be
worth the mentioning, for <HI>Courtezans.</HI> Heer is
also made Sope not inferiour for goodness to that of

<P>The Gentlemens and Citizens Wives are kept
close, seldom walking abroad unless it be to Church,
and then with an old woman at their heels to guard
them. Most of the Gentlemen and Citizens of qua∣lity
put their daughters so soon as they come to
seven or eight years of age, into some Cloister of
Nuns, to be there educated; whence they are not
taken out till they be married. The Suiter seldom
sees his Mistress before they go to be married, or if
he doth see her, it is only at the grate of the Cloister
without speaking to her, all things being transacted
by the Parents on each side, or by the mediation of
an old Woman.</P>
<P>The Government is Aristocratical, but among
the Gentlemen themselves were there no Citizens
or Subjects it would be purely Democratical. As
for the <HI>Doge</HI> or <HI>Duke,</HI> though they call him Prince,
yet they do but mock him, for he hath only the
Title and shew, nothing of the power or Authority
of a Prince. The form of Government as it is ex∣actly
and particularly described by <HI>Contarini, Gianotti</HI>
and <HI>Sansovinus</HI> out of him, because it is much
talked of, I shall heer briefly set down.</P>
<P>The Government then of the Common-wealth is
chiefly in the Great Council; the Senate or Council

<HEAD>Of the GREAT COVNCIL.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Great Council</HI> is as it were the <HI>basis</HI> of the
Commonwealth, in which the supreme power resides,
and from which as well the Senate as all the Magi∣strates
derive their Authority. It is made up of all
the Gentlemen of the City who have passed the
25. year of their age; the number of which is about
2500 in all. But yet before they can be admitted
to give their suffrages in
Council they must before
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The <HI>Auvogadori di Commune</HI> are those who bring in all Causes to the 40 Criminal Judges, called the <HI>Qua∣rantia Criminale,</HI> to whom appeals are made in Criminal Causes from the sentences of inferiour Judges as well wihtin the City as without. Those then that would appeal must first have recourse to the <HI>Auvogadors;</HI> who are all diligently to examin the Cause, and consider whether it ought to be brought in, and if they all agree that it ought not, then he that would ap∣peal hath no remedy, but to expect another set of <HI>Auvogadors;</HI> but if but one of them accepts it, it is enough to bring it in.</NOTE> <HI>Auvogadori di Com∣mune,</HI>
by the oath of their
fathers or mothers, or if
they be dead, of their near∣est
kinsmen, prove that they
have atteined that age; and
by the testimony of two
witnesses, that they are the
legitimate sons of such Gen∣tlemen
as they profess or
pretend themselves to be.
But to satisfie the longing
of such young men as desire
to tast the sweetness of Go∣vernment
sooner, there is a way fo some of those
who are but twenty years of age complete to get
into the Council, <HI>viz.</HI> Before the fourth of <HI>December</HI>
being S. <HI>Barbara's</HI> day, all such young men must in
the manner we have already mentioned, before the
<HI>Auvogadori</HI> prove themselves to be full twenty years
old, and the legitimate sons of Gentlemen. Which
done the Secretary of the <HI>Auvogadori</HI> gives to each
a Schedule sealed by the three <HI>Auvogadori,</HI> signifying
so much. These Schedules they carry to the Secre∣tary
of the <HI>Quarantia criminale,</HI> who writes the
names of them who brought the Schedules, each in
<PB N="158" REF="91"/>
a scroll by itself; and on the 4. of <HI>December</HI> carries
all these scrolls before the <HI>Duke</HI> and <HI>Counsellors,</HI> in
whose presence they are all put into one Urn, and
into another are put so many golden balls as are equal
to the fifth part of the number of scrolls, if it be less
than 30; if it be more than 30, there are yet put in
but 30 balls, and so many silver: ones as with the
golden shall be equal to the number of the young
men competitors. These being shaken together,
the <HI>Duke</HI> out of the first urn draws a scroll and reads
the name, then out of the other takes a ball, which
if it proves to be a golden one; such an one whose
name was written in the scroll is understood to be
admitted into the Council. And so he proceeds,
drawing out first a scroll and then a ball, till all the
golden balls are drawn out; and so without more
ado those thirty whose lot it is to have the golden
balls may go into the Council and ballot: The rest
must stay till another year and then take their chance,
if they are not before come to the age of 25. In
troublesom times when the Common-wealth wants
money, they have also conferred this honour upon
such as are under 25 years for assisting the Public
with the gift or loan of a certain sum of money.</P>
<P>At one end of the Great Council chamber (or Hall
as they call it, though it be an upper room) sits the
Duke on a tribunal elevated above the level of the
chamber, with three of the Counsellours and one
of the heads or chiefs of the Court called <HI>Quarantia
criminale (Capi de Quaranta</HI>) sitting on his right∣hand;
and the other three Counsellors, and below
them the other two chiefs of the <HI>Quarantia</HI> on his
left; and on benches on each side the tribunal,
which make right angles with the end, sit the Great
Chancellour and Secretaries. The fashion of the
Hall and Benches on which the Gentlemen sit, and
the places of the chief Officers and Magistrates, I
shall omit, as being hardly intelligible to such as
<PB N="159" REF="91"/>
have not seen the place, and not very material to
be understood.</P>
<P>The Council is assembled every <HI>Sunday,</HI> and
sometimes oftner, by the tolling of a bell, which
begins at noon and ceases not till one of the clock;
and elects the Magistrates and Officers in this man∣ner:
First of all the Electors or Nominators are
drawn by lot. After that those that are nominated
by such Electors are balloted in the Council, and
those that have above half the suffrages of the Gen∣tlemen
present are understood to be elected.</P>
<P>Now because there must be at least nine Magi∣grates
created at every meeting of the Council, there∣fore
it is necessary to make at least nine Electors:
and because some Magistrates places may have but
two Competitors and some four, and in some days
are created of one sort, in some of another, and in
some of both together; when there are only such
created as can have but two Competitors (which sel∣dom
happens) then there need be but two Sets or
Companies of Electors made: but when any such
are to be created as must have four Competitors,
then there are four Sets of Electors made, of nine
in each Set. While the bell tolls, all the Gentle∣men
that can with convenience are to repair to the
Council, which being once assembled, the doors
lockt up and the Keys brought and laid down at the
Dukes feet, none can afterwards be admitted to en∣ter,
except he be a Counsellor, an <HI>Auvogador,</HI> one
of the heads or chiefs of the Council of ten (called
<HI>Capi de Dieci</HI>) or a Censor.</P>
<P><HI>NB.</HI> (1.) For the creation of Magistrates there is
no <HI>Quorum</HI> or determinate number of Gentlemen
required to be present to make a Council; though
it seldom happens the Council-chamber not to be
full. For other business as the establishing new
Laws, determining any Sentence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Quorum</HI>
is 600, without which number nothing can be done.
<PB N="160" REF="92"/>
(2.) Unless there be four of the Counsellors present,
there can be neither Officers created nor any other
business agitated in the Great Council.</P>
<P>The Duke; the chief Magistrates and Officers, and
all the Gentlemen being set down in their places;
before the Tribunal on which the Duke sits, in the
plain of the Council-chamber, are placed on a
three urns called <HI>Capelli,</HI> upon stands so high above
the floor that no man can look into them, and yet
for greater security they are also covered, only the
two outermost have two holes in their covers to
put in the hand to draw out the balls. The mid∣dlemost
that stands over against the Duke hath but
one hole. In each of the two outermost urns are
put about 800 balls made of copper and gilded over
with silver (which I shall take leave to call silver
balls, as those that are gilded with gold, golden
balls) so that the whole number in both amounts
to about 1500 or 1600, for so many Gentlemen are
commonly present at each meeting of the Great
Council. Besides in these urns together with the
silver are mingled 60 golden balls, 30 in each urn.
In the middlemost urn are put 60 balls, where∣of
36 are golden and 24 silver. Then the Great
Chancellor (who is always a Citizen and no Gentle∣man)
goeth to his place appointed for that purpose,
and reads what Magistrates are to be created that
day, which done, he returns to the tribunal, and
calling the <HI>Auvogadors,</HI> the <HI>Capi de Dieci,</HI> the Cen∣sors
and the old and new Auditors, he administers
to them an oath to observe the laws of the Council,
in which is conteined, that all shall sit▪ that none
shall change his bench at prohibited times; that
none shall seek any Magistracy by dishonest means, or
favour and abet any other in so doing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When they
are sworn, they return to their places, and the three
junior Counsellors rising up, the eldest of them goes
and sets him down over against the middlemost urn,
<PB N="161" REF="92"/>
the next before that on the right hand of the Duke,
and the youngest over against that on the left. Then
there are lots drawn what bench shall come first up
to the <HI>Capello,</HI> (the whole Council being divided
into five benches of Gentlemen) and what end of
that bench, and what side of that end (for all the
benches are double) in this manner. There are put
into an urn ten silver balls, five of them marked with
the five first figures or the characters of the numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and by each number is written such an
end and such a side. The other five balls are marked
with the same figures, but on each of them is writ∣ten
the contrary end and contrary side. So that if
under the figure 1 in the first five be written, the end
towards the <HI>Broil</HI> and the side towards S. <HI>Georges;</HI>
under the figure 1 in the other five is written, the
end towards <HI>Castello</HI> and the side next S. <HI>Mark</HI>'s.
Then they draw out of the urn one of these balls,
the figure and inscription whereof shews what bench
and what end and side of that bench is to come first
up to the <HI>Capello.</HI> Then they look into the urn and
take out that ball which is marked with the same fi∣gure
and the contrary end and side. After the same
manner they draw out by lot another ball, and so a
third, fourth and fifth, calling up the benches in or∣der,
till all the Electors are made. Of the bench
that is called first, each one in order comes up to one
of the exteriour urns, and draws thereout a ball,
which if it be silver, he puts it into another urn set
on the floor at the foot of that out of which he drew
it, and returns to his place, having obteined nothing;
but if it be a golden one, he delivers it into the hand
of that Counsellor who sits by that urn, and goes
presently to the middle urn, and thence also draws
out a ball; which if it be silver, having presented
it to the Counsellor who sits before the urn, he re∣turns
to his place: but if it be gold, he delivers it
likewise to the Counsellor, and is understood to be
<PB N="162" REF="93"/>
one of the Electors of the first set; and sits down on
the bench on which the said Counsellor sits (which
stands across the Dukes tribunal) with his face to∣ward
the Duke, that none in the Hall may by any
nod or other sign recommend themselves to him.
Then a Secretary pronounces his name aloud, that
all of his family or near to him by affinity may take
notice of it. There he continues sitting till all the
other eight of the first set of Electors be in like man∣ner
by lot created. And if by chance two of one
family are drawn in the first set, the second of them
is reserved for the second set or company, and he
that is first taken for the second set comes in his
room into the first. And then for that day none of
that family nor any that are of near affinity to him
can come any more to the <HI>Capello,</HI> because it is pro∣vided
by the Laws, that in all the four sets of Ele∣ctors
which make up 36, there shall be no more than
two of the same family; and that those two shall
not be in the same set, so that the nine that are of
the same set must be of nine several families. To
the youngest of the nine of this first set is by one of
the Secretaries delivered a Schedule sealed by the
public Seal, wherein are written in order all the
Magistrates that are to be that day created. Then
all the nine take an oath, to chuse those whom they
shall judge most fit to serve the Common-wealth,
and go forth the Council-chamber into a private
room appointed for them. In like manner are the
other three sets of Electors made, who being sworn
do likewise take their Schedules, and withdraw into
their respective rooms. When all the four sets of
Electors are chosen and withdrawn, then any of the
Gentlemen in the Council-chamber may change his
bench as he pleases. [<HI>NB.</HI> When there are only such
Magistracies to be disposed of as can have but two
Competitors, there are but two sets of Electors
made.] When the first set is withdrawn, they sit
<PB N="163" REF="93"/>
down, taking place according to their age. Then
a Secretary appointed for that purpose reads to them
the laws and constitutions which they are obliged
to observe in the choice of Magistrates: after which
he puts into an urn nine balls, marked with the nine
numeral characters or figures, and each Elector ac∣cording
to his age draws out one till they be all
drawn out. He that draws the ball marked 1, is
understood to have the nomination of the Competi∣tor
for the first Magistrates place set down in the
Schedule, and he who draws that marked 2, to have
the nomination of the second, and so in order of
the rest. When there are eleven Magistrates to be
made in a day, he that hath the nomination of the
first, nominates also the tenth, and he that hath
the second the eleventh. [<HI>NB.</HI> One of these Ele∣ctors
may nominate himself to any Office: they
may also change their Votes among themselves, as
for example, he that hath the nomination of the
Competitor for the first place may change with him
who hath the nomination for the second or third, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and so of any other.] He then who hath by lot
obteined the nomination of a Competitor for the
first Magistrate, names one whom he pleases, who
is balloted among the nine, and if he hath two thirds
of the suffrages, he is understood to be elected; if
not, he names a second and so a third, till he comes
to propound one that gets two thirds. His name
that is so approved is by the Secretary set down in
the Schedule under the name of that place to which
he is nominated, with the name of him who pro∣pounded
him, and the set of Electors he was of; be∣cause
if the nominated be to a place wherein he is
entrusted with the management of public moneys,
he that nominates is surety for him, and is to make
good what he defrauds the Common-wealth of.
Then he that hath the second voice names his man,
who is balloted and approved in like manner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="94"/>
The same order of nomination and approbation is
observed in the other three sets of Electors. Only
in the third and fourth sets when there are some of
those places to be disposed of which can have but
two Competitors, its necessary that some of the
Electors, to whose lot the nomination to such pla∣ces
falls, nominate not at all; because the Compe∣titors
to such places are already nominated and ap∣proved
in the two first sets. Yet is not their being
Electors altogether useless and insignificant, because
they have power to ballot those that are nominated
by the other Electors. If any difficulty arises
among the Electors about any person nominated,
<HI>v. g.</HI> whether he may be balloted or the like, one of
the <HI>Auvogadors</HI> and one of the <HI>Capi de Dieci</HI> go
into the room where those Electors are and deter∣min
it.</P>
<P>The Competitors being in this manner chosen,
none of the Electors returns any more into the
Council-chamber, unless he be one of the Counsel∣lors,
or one of the <HI>Capi di Dieci,</HI> or of the <HI>Auvoga∣dors,</HI>
or of the Censors. The Secretaries then of
the several companies of Electors present to the
Great Chancellor the Schedules in which are written
the Magistrates to be elected, and under every one
the Competitors, for it. Now it may happen that
one and the same Gentleman may be chosen Com∣petitor
for a Magistracy by two or three or all four
of the sets of Electors, and then though he hath
no Competitor he may be balloted, because he is
understood to be Competitor to himself. But if for
one place there be chosen in each of the sets a Com∣petitor,
then they look first whether he be not un∣capable
of such a place, either by reason he hath
had some Magistracy lately, and the time not yet
expired that is required by the law before he be ca∣pable
of another, or because some of his kinred is
in an incompatible place; or bacause he is indebted
<PB N="165" REF="94"/>
to the public or the like. Now if of four Compe∣titors
three are found uncapable, the fourth remain∣ing
without a Competitor cannot be balloted. But
if one be elected in two sets and his two Competi∣tors
uncapable of standing, yet may he be balloted,
for the reason before alleged.</P>
<P>The Great Chancellor having received the Sche∣dules,
reads aloud the names of all the Magistrates
places with their Competitors; and then beginning
from the first he propounds the Competitors for
that, and first him that was nominated by the first
set, and if he were nominated by any other of the
sets, he mentions that also. And when he hath
read the names of all the Competitors for one place,
they all that are nominated and all of their family
and near affinity go out of the Council-chamber into
a private room, where they stay till they have been
all balloted, and the second place propounded with
its Competitors; and then they return again and
ballot. As soon as they are withdrawn, the Great
Chancellor with a loud voice -puts all in mind, that
both by the Divine and humane law every one is
obliged to favour him whom he judges to be best of
all and fittest to serve the Common-wealth in such
place as they shall chuse him to. Then he nominates
the first Competitor, and little boys appointed for
that purpose (having first delivered to every Gentle∣man
a ball) run about the chamber with balloting
boxes in their hands to gather the suffrages. The
balls are made of linen that they may make no noise
when they fall into the boxes. The boxes are made
double, the one painted white, the other green.
The white is marked with <HI>Si,</HI> i. e. Yea, into which
they that accept put their balls; and the green with
<HI>No,</HI> into which they that refuse the party propound∣ed
put theirs. The boxes are made in that manner
with a hole in the side to thrust in the hand, that no
man can see into which box you let fall the ball.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="95"/>
These little boys as they go along gathering the balls,
repete still aloud the name of the person that is then
balloted. When they have gathered up the balls,
they carry them to the Dukes tribunal, and put the
<HI>Yea's</HI> in a white vessel there standing, and the <HI>No's</HI>
in a green. The Affirmative or <HI>Yea's</HI> are told over
by the Counsellors sitting on the right hand of the
Duke, and the Negative or <HI>No's</HI> by them sitting on
the left; and if the <HI>Si's</HI> are less than half the whole
number of suffrages, such a person hath lost it; but
if they be more he may obtein it; and therefore the
number by which it exceeds the half is set down. In
the mean time the other Competitors are named and
balloted in like manner, and at last he whose affir∣mative
suffrages or <HI>Si's</HI> exceed the half by the greater
number, is understood to be chosen to that place. The
like method of proceeding is observed in the choice
of the second, third and all the rest of the Magi∣strates
for that day. When the balloting and coun∣ting
is done, the Great Chancellor gives notice who
are elected, commanding them to present themselves
before the Censors, who take an oath of them that
they have not done any thing contrary to the laws to
obtein those places; which done the Council is dis∣mist.
<HI>NB.</HI> If none of the Competitors for any place
have above half the number of suffrages, there is none
as yet understood to be chosen to that place. And be∣cause
by an antient Law the Great Council is to break
up before Sun-set, if it happens any of the Competi∣tors
are not before that time come to the ballot, the
names of such Magistrates and Officers as are chosen
are read, and they that remain to be balloted lose the
benefit of their nomination, because the next Coun∣cil-day
all is begun anew and there are other Compe∣titors
made. It is permitted to any stranger to be
present at the meetings of the Great Council (as we
were several times) to see the manner of proceeding
there, and there is a particular bench appointed for
them to sit on.</P>

<HEAD>Of the PREGADI.</HEAD>
<P>In the Council of the <HI>Pregadi</HI> are debated and de∣termined
all the great and weighty affairs of the
Common-wealth. This Council in former times
consisted of no more than 60. Afterwards they
began to add thereto sometimes 25, sometimes 20,
insomuch that it was at last concluded, that there
should be made an addition to it (<HI>Aggiunta</HI> they call
it) of as many more. The cause of such additions
was, I suppose, the greatness and importance of
the affairs then to be considered and treated of, that
so a greater number of Gentlemen being present at
such consultations and debates, matters might be
better disputed, and more throughly scanned and ex∣amined.
In the number of the 60 <HI>Pregadi</HI> there can
be but three of one and the same family, and if there
be three in the <HI>Pregadi</HI> there can be but two in the
<HI>Giunta;</HI> if there but two in the <HI>Pregadi</HI> there may
then be three in the <HI>Giunta.</HI> Besides the 120 we
have mentioned, this Council takes in also many
other Councils and Magistrates, whereof some have
suffrages and some have not, only to add reputation
to them, they are permitted to be present, to hear
the debates and understand the affairs of the Com∣mon-wealth.
Those which enter into this Council
with power of balloting are, The Duke; the six
Counsellors; the Council of ten; the Auvogadors;
all the Procurators of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> which in <HI>Sansovinus</HI>

Custom-Officers, the three <HI>Cataueri,</HI> who have also
to do with part of the public revenue, as Escheats
to the Commonwealth, in case a man dies intestate
and without heirs; mulcts of such as are cast in a
Suit: they judge also concerning treasures found
either at sea or land.</P>
<P>Those that enter into the Council and have no
suffrages are the <HI>College</HI> or Company of the <HI>Savi;</HI>
The Proveditors <HI>sopra le Acque,</HI> who are to take care
of the <HI>Lagune</HI> and scouring the chanels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
<HI>Dieci Savii,</HI> who see that tithes be duly set out and
<PB N="169" REF="96"/>
paid; give possession, register Bargains and Sales, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
The three Officers of Health, who take care that the
City be kept clean, and nothing noisome or offensive
left in the Streets, nothing that is corrupted, or that
may cause sickness and infection bought and sold ei∣ther
by land or water; from these Mountebanks and
Physicians take licenses, and they keep account of
the number of Whores who are licensed, and in
time of any Epidemical Disease they have absolute
power of life and death. The three over the <HI>Datii,</HI> or
public Customs and Excise; the Proveditors over
the of <HI>Alexandria;</HI> the twelve
over that of <HI>Damascus,</HI> and the twelve over that of
<HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pregadi</HI> were so called, as some think, be∣cause
anciently they were assembled by public Mi∣nisters,
and by them as it were prayed and entreated
that they would come and consult of the affairs of
the Commonwealth. The <HI>Pregadi</HI> properly so called
are chosen by the Gr. Council, as the other Magi∣strates
are, in the manner before related. They be∣gin
so soon to chuse them that all of them may be
elected by the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> at which time
they enter upon their Office. The <HI>Giunta</HI> or other 60
are chosen both by the Council of the old <HI>Pregadi</HI> and
the Great Council in this manner. Upon <HI>Michaelmas</HI>
day the Council of the old <HI>Pregadi</HI> is assembled,
wherein each one of those that have suffrages nomi∣nates
the person whom he would have to be of the
<HI>Giunta.</HI> All the nominated are written down. The
next day the Great Council is convened, and the
names of all the persons nominated by the <HI>Pregadi</HI>
having been first read, are put into an urn, and thence
one by one drawn out be one of the Secretaries, and
balloted by the Council; and he that obtains above
half of the suffrages is reckoned to be one of the
<HI>Giunta.</HI> The other Magistrates comprehended in this
Council, it matters not at what time they be created;
<PB N="170" REF="97"/>
because when the <HI>Pregadi</HI> enter upon their admini∣stration,
those who at present exercise such offices
are numbred among them as members of the Coun∣cil;
and if their offices determine before the <HI>Prega∣di</HI>'s,
their successours enter in their places. Besides
those who assist the Commonwealth in a time of
need with their estates, lending such a sum of mony
as the Law determines, have liberty granted them to
be present in this Council, and to understand the
management of public affairs (yet without power
of balloting) till such time as their moneys be repaid,
and sometimes longer. For the Law prescribes them
such a time to enjoy this honour, though their mony
be repaid them before. By this constitution the Com∣monwealth
reaps a double benefit. First, it seldom
wants mony upon any exigent, many being willing
to lend, that they may enjoy this privilege. Secondly,
it trains up young men to the knowledge of State-affairs,
and qualifies and enables them to manage
public business when they shall be thereto called.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pregadi</HI> are assembled as often as it pleases the
<HI>College.</HI> A Council is also granted to the Magistrates
when they would confirm any Law, and to the <HI>Au∣vogadors,</HI>
when they have any difficult case to bring
in to be determined. The time of their meeting is
signified by the tolling of a Bell; it is also a custom
to send to give notice and invite them by public Ser∣jeants
or Ministers. They cannot enter into any con∣sultation
about public business, unless there be pre∣sent
four of the Counsellours, and 60 at least of such
as have suffrages. In this Council are consultations
had, and resolutions taken about Peace and War,
truces and agreements, and ways of providing mo∣ney
for the necessities and uses of the Commonwealth.
How these affairs are treated of will appear when we
shall come to speak of the College. Laws are also
confirmed in this Council, which are first considered
by those Magistrates, who are over that business to
<PB N="171" REF="97"/>
which such Laws appertain, Such Magistrates come
first to the College, and there shew either the necessi∣ty
or the benefit and utility of such Laws as they
would introduce; and if the College approves of
them, then they are permitted to bring them into the
Council of <HI>Pregadi;</HI> and if they pass there, then are
they valid, and published by public <HI>bando</HI> or Pro∣clamation;
after which every one is obliged to take
notice of them and observe them: and the Magi∣strate
that introduced them is to see that they be put
in execution. They use also sometimes to get their
laws confirmed, not only in the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI>
but also in the Great Council. The which thing (saith
my Author) is I suppose principally in the power of
him who brings in the Law to do, and is usually done
to gain more reputation, and add strength to the
Law. Besides in the Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> is chosen a
Captain of the <HI>Armata,</HI> in case the Commonwealth
hath occasion to make war by Sea; and a Provedi∣tor
of the Camp when they make war by Land: those
three kinds of Magistrates, which they call, <HI>i. e.
Savi grandi, Savi di Terra ferma &amp; Savi di mare:</HI>
which elections are made after this manner. Each
one of the <HI>Pregadi</HI> nominates one whom he pleases.
All that are so nominated are balloted, and he that
obtains more then half the number of suffrages is
understood to be chosen to that office or dignity. But
because it may often happen that he who is judged
fittest for such or such an office may be known to be
unwilling to accept it, and no man for fear of dis∣pleasing
him may dare publicly to nominate him;
therefore to avoid that inconvenience, each of the
<HI>Pregadi</HI> writes down in a paper the name of him
whom he would chuse to such a place; which Scrolls
are all together put into an urn, and drawn out by
the Great Chancellor one by one; and the names
written therein being openly read, they are put to
the ballot, and on him who hath more then half the
<PB N="172" REF="98"/>
suffrages is such Office or Dignity conferred. But
when there is a Captain of the <HI>Armata</HI> to be made,
he that is in this manner chosen in the Council of
<HI>Pregadi</HI> must be afterwards ballotted in the <HI>Great
Council,</HI> and have Competitors given him by the
four sets of Electors in manner before related, and
he who hath most suffrages above the half is under∣stood
to be elected. The Counsellours also, and the
Censors are elected partly by the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI>
and partly by the Great Council.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the COLLEGE.</HEAD>
<P>The College is the third member of the Com∣monwealth,
and of great reputation. It is made up
principally of three sets or kinds of Magistrates.
First those they call <HI>Savi grande.</HI> 2. Those they call
<HI>Savi di terra ferma.</HI> And 3. those they call <HI>Savi di
mare.</HI> The number of the <HI>Savi grandi</HI> is six; of
each of the other, five; in all sixteen. And besides
these of the <HI>Signoria,</HI> that is the Duke, the six Coun∣sellors,
and the three heads or chiefs of the 40 Crimi∣nal
Judges, called <HI>Capi di Quaranta.</HI> The <HI>Savi</HI> of
the Sea, who are otherwise called <HI>Savi à gli ordini,</HI>
take care of all maritime affairs, as well such as con∣cern
peace and war as other matters. The <HI>Savi</HI> of the
Land manage and govern Land affairs, such as ap∣pertain
to peace and war, and their especial charge is
to keep account of all Souldiers that are in the Com∣monwealths
pay. The <HI>Savi grandi</HI> over-see and take
care of both, as well at home as abroad. And their
particular charge is to make provision both for Peace
and war, to write to and answer Princes Letters,
and finally to counsel and govern the whole Com∣monwealth.
It is to be noted that anciently the <HI>Sa∣vi
grandi</HI> did include the authority and administration
of the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land, whence the <HI>Savi grandi</HI>
might intermeddle with the affairs belonging to the
<PB N="173" REF="98"/>
Land, though not excluding the <HI>Savi</HI> of the <HI>Land.</HI>
In the same manner the <HI>Savi</HI> of the land included
those of the Sea, but were not included by them, and
therefore with the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea could take into
their consideration Sea-affa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs. So that the <HI>Savi
grandi</HI> included both the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land, and the
<HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea; the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land only those
of the Sea. But in our times, and not many
years since the way of managing such affairs is a lit∣tle
altered. For that by Law it is determined, that
the Authority and administration of the <HI>Savi</HI> of the
land shall be equal to that of the Grand <HI>Savi;</HI> only
that of the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea remains in the same terms
it was. In old time there were no other then the
Grand <HI>Savi;</HI> afterward the naval power and com∣mand
at Sea being encreased, it was found necessary
to create a Council for Sea affairs or <HI>Savi di mare.</HI>
The like happened afterward when the Republic
began to grow great on the Land, the Senate being
constrained to create <HI>Savi di terra ferma,</HI> which was
presently after that <HI>Treviso</HI> came under their domini∣on.
Anciently the <HI>Savi di mare</HI> were of greater re∣putation
then those of the <HI>terra ferma,</HI> but after
that the Dominion of the Commonwealth began to
encrease upon the Land, they bent their counsels and
endeavours that way, and so the <HI>Savi di mare</HI> lost their
reputation, and those of the <HI>Terra ferma</HI> gained it.
These three kinds of Magistrates are chosen by the
Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> in the same manner as the Pro∣veditor
of the Camp. None can be made <HI>Savio
grande</HI> unless he be of mature age, and reputed of
the greatest abilities. The <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land are al∣ways
men of reputation for prudence, but not so great
as the <HI>Savi grandi;</HI> the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea are still of less
esteem then they. And at present this Magistracy
serves rather to give young men occasion to exercise
themselves in State-business, then for any other pur∣pose,
because in matters of moment the <HI>Savi grandi,</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="99"/>
and <HI>Savi di terra ferma</HI> are always employed. Each
of these companies of Magistrates chuse one of them∣selves
<HI>Praepositus,</HI> or Prevost, who is chief of that
Magistracy for one week; he propounds matters in
the College and Records those things which are to
be executed which appertain to his Magistracy. The
manner of proceeding and transacting public af∣fairs
in the <HI>College</HI> is this. Every morning two hours
after Sun-rising the <HI>College</HI> is convened. [<HI>N. B.</HI>
whenever we speak of the <HI>College</HI> we understand the
three Societies of Magistrates before-mentioned, to∣gether
with the Duke, the Counsellors, and the three
<HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI> that is with the <HI>Signoria,</HI> who
have their places not only in this <HI>College,</HI> but also in
the Grand Council, the Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> and the
Council of ten: So that nothing is debated without
their presence and intervention.] The <HI>College</HI> being
assembled, all those Letters are read that were re∣ceived
since their last meeting: Audience is given to
publick Oratours and Embassadours, if any require
it; and each of the three Societies of <HI>Savi</HI> dispatch
such business as appertains to them, and was pro∣pounded
and recorded by their <HI>Provost.</HI> If therefore
there be any business to be debated appertaining to
the Grand <HI>Savi,</HI> the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land, and of the
Sea may be excluded: but if it be not of very great
importance, they do not use to prohibit them to be
present at such deliberations, but their part is only
to hear and hold their peace: or if they do deliver
their opinions, yet are they not noted down to be
brought into the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> but only the
opinions of the Grand <HI>Savi,</HI> the Counsellors, the
<HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI> and the Duke. And to the end
that the whole method and order of this administra∣tion
may be the better understood by an example,
let us suppose there is a consultation to be had about
some affairs appertaining to the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea, they
cannot exclude the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land, and the <HI>Grand
<PB N="175" REF="99"/>
Savi,</HI> if they please to interpose and meddle with
that affair. After consultation had thereupon, not on∣ly
the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea, but they of the Land, and
the <HI>Grand Savi,</HI> the Duke also and the Counsellors
and <HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI> may deliver their opinions if
they please, and according as they are of one or
more different opinions, make one or several par∣ties
[by parties we mean nothing but propositions
or sentences.] For that each <HI>Savio</HI> and Counsellour,
much more the Duke, when they do not agree to the
opinions of others, may each bring in a party (that
is, propound his sentence or judgment about a busi∣ness)
alone. All these parties are noted by a Secreta∣ry,
each one with the name of that <HI>Savio</HI> or other
person that was the Author of it. And because no
matter belonging to the public administration can
be determined without the approbation and consent
of the Council of <HI>Pregadi;</HI> therefore that Council
being assembled, the aforesaid Magistrates come with
their parties or propositions noted, and propound
them in order. If the parties be more then one (as
suppose four) they are all propounded together, but
that is first read the Author whereof is the more ho∣nourable
Magistrate, and therefore those of the
Duke and Counsellors ought to precede the rest,
those of the <HI>Savi grandi,</HI> them of the <HI>Savi</HI> of the
Land; and theirs those of the <HI>Savi di mare.</HI> And if
any of the three Societies of <HI>Savi</HI> in matters apper∣taining
to their charge have taken several parties,
that party ought first to be propounded, of which
he is Authour, who in that Society is most honor∣able.
The parties being propounded, if any of the
<HI>Savi</HI> will speak against them, he ought to precede
the rest of the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> and among them first that
<HI>Savio</HI> who is of greatest Authority. After that any
of the <HI>Pregadi</HI> hath liberty to do the same. After suf∣ficient
debate upon all the parties, they are all balloted
together in this manner. Suppose the parties to be
<PB N="176" REF="100"/>
four, then there are four Secretaries come in, having
each a white box in his hand: after them another
Secretary follows with a green box, and after him
still another with a red box. The first of the four
goes from person to person, repeating the name of
him that was author of the party first propounded:
the second, third, and fourth in like manner repeat∣ing
the names of the second, third, and fourth, and
each one of the <HI>Pregadi</HI> puts his ballot into what box
he pleases. So that if he approves not the first party,
he puts his ballot in his box that gathers the suffra∣ges
for that party that pleases him. If he approves
none of the four, then he puts his ballot in the green
box: but if the matter be not yet clear to him, and
he be not fully satisfied about it, he puts his ballot in∣to
the red box that comes last, and is called the box of
the <HI>Non sinceri,</HI> i. e. such as neither approve or re∣ject.
The Suffrages being thus gathered, the ballots
of each party are told over, and that which exceeds
the half by most suffrages is understood to be confir∣med
and ratified; but if none come up to the half,
then that which hath the least number of suffrages
being laid aside, the other three are balloted after the
same manner, with three boxes, and after them a
green and a red one. If none of the three get half
the number of suffrages, then that which hath fewest
being again laid aside, the remaining two are ballo∣ted
in like manner; and if neither of these passeth
the half, then that which hath the most suffrages is
balloted alone: and if the suffrages for that exceed
not the half, none of the parties balloted is under∣stood
to be confirmed: in which case new parties
must be brought in, if the matter treated of be ne∣cessary,
which may be done the same day, because
the Duke, any one of the Counsellors, <HI>Capi di Qua∣ranta,</HI>
or <HI>Savi</HI> may bring in new parties. Such a bu∣siness
may also be referred to another day. But it sel∣dom
happens that of so many parties no one is ap∣proved.
<PB N="177" REF="100"/>
When none of them is confirmed, and the
matter requires further debate, we shall declare what
order is taken when we come to treat of the Council
of Ten. But it is to be noted, that the first time all
the parties are balloted together, it may happen that
there are more then half the suffrages in the box of
the <HI>Non-sinceri,</HI> i. e. such as suspend, being not clear
in the point; and in such case none of the parties
can be balloted, but the matter requiring new debate,
new parties are to be brought in. And because it may
happen that some one of the Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> may
have upon some matter under consideration a propo∣sition
to make, which may be for the benefit and ad∣vantage
of the Commonwealth, which came not in∣to
the minds of the <HI>Savi</HI> or others who have power
of propounding their judgments or opinions in
Council, that such advantage be not lost, it is or∣dained
that such opinion or sentiment be communi∣cated
to one of those who have power to propound,
and by him propounded to the Council. But that
none but the <HI>Savi</HI> and others before-mentioned
should have liberty to bring in parties, is ordained to
avoid prolixity and confusion; it being also unlikely
that what comes not into the thoughts and conside∣ration
of the College, in which are the wisest per∣sons
of the City, should be imagined or found out
by other men. But granting this might sometimes
happen, yet it would be so seldom, that no great ac∣count
ought to be made of it; and so much the ra∣ther,
because in every constitution the lesser conve∣nience
ought to give place to the greater. To every
of these three Societies of <HI>Savi,</HI> the same time of
six months determines their office: but yet are not
all the persons in each chosen at the same time. For
the grand <HI>Savi</HI> are chosen at two several times, three
at once; and from the choice of the first to the choice
of the second intercedes three months time. The <HI>Savi</HI>
of the Land, and the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea are also chosen at
<PB N="178" REF="101"/>
two times, three the first time, and two the second;
with the same interval between. To the grand <HI>Savi</HI>
there is sometimes, great affairs requiring it, added an
<HI>Aggiunta</HI> of three more, and these we call <HI>Savi straor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dinarii.</HI>
One may be chosen into the Council of <HI>Pre∣gadi</HI>
successively two or more years one after another.</P>

<P>Of the Antiquity of this Magistrate, and what
great power and authority he had in ancient times,
and how afterwards it came to be moderated and di∣minished,
I shall say nothing, only shew in what
manner he is elected, and what Authority he hath in
our times. So soon as the former <HI>Duke</HI> is dead, the
six Counsellors enter into the Palace with the three
<HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI> of whom we shall speak heerafter.

three days; and there are twenty Gentlemen ap∣pointed,
who being clothed with Scarlet, accompany
it when it is carried down, and sit round about it
till night, returning again the next morning, and
this they continue to do for three days. Then is the
Funeral celebrated with all the Pomp and Magnifi∣cence
which the Dignity of such a Magistrate re∣quires.
The next day after the Funeral the Great
Council is convened, and given to understand by the
Great Chancellor, that being to give beginning to
the Election of a new Duke, they are first to make
choice of five Correctors and three Inquisitors. The
Vice-Duke then standing up, makes a Speech to the
Council, and having commended the Life, Behavi∣our,
and Government of the Duke deceased, exhorts
and stirs up every one to make choice of a person to
succeed him, that may be useful and honourable to
the Commonwealth. Then doth he cause the Laws
to be read, which prescribe the manner and order of
electing the new Duke: and last of all the Council
proceed to elect the said five Correctors and three
Inquisitors after the same manner they use in the
choice of other Magistrates. The office of the Inqui∣sitors
is diligently to examine the life and actions of
the deceased Prince, and if they find that he hath in
any thing erred or done amiss, they are obliged to
accuse him; and look what punishment he hath de∣served
is inflicted on his heirs. But such punishments
are never corporal, but only pecuniary mulcts. And
such a Cause, by reason it is a business of great im∣portance,
is not finally determined by the Inquisi∣tors,
but agitated in the Great Council, and may
also be examined in the <HI>Quarantia criminale.</HI> These
Inquisitors have a years time to finish their Inquisiti∣on in.
The office of the Correctors is to see and
consider well if any new Law to be observed by the
succeeding Prince is needful to be introduced: and if
there have been any error discovered in the admini∣stration
<PB N="180" REF="103"/>
of the Precedent Duke that ought to be cor∣rected.
For the doing of which so soon as they are
created they are brought into a certain Chamber,
where they meet so often till they be agreed upon
what to them seems needful to be amended, or sit to
be newly introduced; and this commonly takes up
three or four days. When they have finished their
considerations, they therewith acquaint the <HI>Signoria,</HI>
who cause the Great Council to be convened, in the
accustomed place and manner; whither the said Cor∣rectors
come, and there cause all such Laws and Cor∣rections
as they judge fit to be made, to be publicly
recited; which being balloted one by one in the
great Council, are either confirmed or rejected. This
done, the Great Council the day following is again
called, to which meeting none can come but such as
have passed the 30 year of their age. The doors being
shut at the appointed time, all that are present in
Council are numbred over, and in an urn or <HI>Capello</HI>
of that sort which have but one hole in their cover,
are put 30 golden balls, marked with a certain note,
and as many silver ones as together with the golden
are equal to the number of the Gentlemen present.
After this the junior Counsellor goes out into St.
<HI>Marks</HI> Church, which is fast by, and having made
his reverence to the Altar, takes a little boy which he
finds there, and brings him along with him into the
Council; who is to draw the ballots out of the urn
for the Gentlemen who they come up to the <HI>Capello,</HI>
they not being permitted to draw them out them∣selves,
to avoid fraud. This boy is called the <HI>Ballo∣tino,</HI>
and is he that in processions goes before the
<HI>Duke,</HI> who is bound so soon as the boy comes to be
of convenient age to make him one of the Secreta∣ries.
The <HI>Ballotine</HI> being brought in before the <HI>Sig∣noria,</HI>
one Counsellor and one <HI>Capo de Quaranta</HI> cho∣sen
by lot, go and set themselves down before the
<HI>Capello,</HI> Then they draw lots which Bench is to come
<PB N="181" REF="103"/>
up first. [<HI>N. B.</HI> Because there is but one <HI>Capello,</HI> the
Benches do not come up by two and two, as in the
creation of Magistrates, but one by one; and there∣fore
there are put in ten lots into the urn and drawn
out as before, and the benches come up accordingly.]
If one of those five benches on the side towards St.
<HI>Georges</HI> be drawn, they are to begin to come up at
that end that is toward the <HI>Broil;</HI> and if one of those
five that are toward S. <HI>Marks</HI> be drawn, they are to
begin to come up at the end toward <HI>Castello.</HI> The lots
being drawn, that Gentleman that sits first at that
end of the bench which is to begin, arises and goes
up to the <HI>Capello.</HI> Then the <HI>Ballotine</HI> in his name draws
out a ball, which if it be a silver one, he puts it in
another <HI>Capello</HI> standing at the foot of that out of
which he drew it, and he for whom it was drawn
goes presently out of the Council-chamber. But if
it be gilded and marked, he delivers it to the Coun∣sellor
sitting by, and the Great Chancellor pronoun∣ces
aloud the name of him for whom it was drawn:
who presently between two Secretaries is carried into
a room out of the Council Chamber. Then all
those who are of his Family, his Uncles, Cousins,
Father-in-law, and they that are of near affinity to
him are called, and being come up to the Tribunal,
numbred by one of the Secretaries, and so many
silver balls taken out of the <HI>Capello</HI> as are equal to
the sum of them, and so they depart the Coun∣cil-chamber.
In the same order all the rest of the
benches are called by lot, till all the golden balls are
drawn out of the <HI>Capello.</HI> And after those who have
obtained them are withdrawn into the fore-mention∣ed
room the Council is dismist: and the 30 come all
before the <HI>Signoria,</HI> and sit down on two benches
there standing, half on the one, and half on the
other. Then in a certain <HI>Capello</HI> there placed are
put 21 silver Balls and 9 golden; and these 30 per∣sons
being called according to the order they were

chosen in, come up one by one to the <HI>Capello,</HI> and the
<HI>Ballotine</HI> draws out a ballot for each one, till all the
golden balls are drawn. Those then for whom the
silver balls were drawn depart, and those nine who
obtained the golden withdraw into the fore-menti∣oned
room; where when they are all come together
they are by the <HI>Signoria</HI> conducted into another
room, where are set ready all necessary accommoda∣tions
for them: and having given oath to make a
good election, they continue there locked up toge∣ther
till they have chosen 40 of 40 different Families:
in which election they thus proceed. So soon as they
are shut up they draw lots among themselves, who
shall nominate first, who second, who third, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
accordingly in that order nominate. Those nomi∣nated
are balloted among the nine, and if they have
seven suffrages they are understood to be of the 40.
The election being finished, they signifie so much to
the <HI>Signoria.</HI> The which the same day, or if it be
too late the day following, cause the Great Council
to be called; which when it is assembled, the Great
Chancellor with two Secretaries goes to the nine for
the Schedule in which the 40 Electors are written;
and returning therewith into the Council by the
command of the <HI>Signoria</HI> reads over the names of
them that are chosen; who one by one coming before
the Tribunal are sent out of the Council into a cer∣tain
Chamber; and if any one of the 40 happens not
to be present in Council, one of the Counsellors and
one <HI>Capo de Quaranta</HI> go to search him out, and with∣out
giving him leave to speak to any body, bring
him into the Council-chamber, and afterwards into
the room where his companions are withdrawn.
When the 40 are all met together the Council is
dismist, and then after the manner of the former 30,
these 40 come before the <HI>Signoria,</HI> and being set up∣on
the two benches in the middle, they are likewise
by lot called up to the <HI>Capello,</HI> wherein are put 28
<PB N="183" REF="104"/>
silver balls, and 12 golden. Those for whom the sil∣ver
balls are drawn depart the Hall; and those for
whom the golden are brought by the <HI>Signoria</HI> either
into the Chamber where the former nine were, or in∣to
another as they please; where having taken oath
to make a good election, they are locked up, and by
way of suffrage chuse 25 of 25 several Families, in
the same manner as the nine chose the 40; to which
Election 9 suffrages of the 12 are necessary. The
Election being made, they acquaint the <HI>Signoria</HI>
therewith; which if the time permits, causes the
great Council to be assembled the same day; if not,
the day following, and after the same manner the
Great Chancellor reads the names of the 25: and
those that are chosen when they hear their names
read, come up to the Tribnnal, and are sent out of
the Council into a room by themselves as were the
40: and if any one be not present, he is searched
out and brought in like wise. When all the 25 are
met, the Council is broken up, and the 25 come be∣fore
the <HI>Signoria,</HI> and sitting down, are called by
lot, and come up to the <HI>Capello,</HI> into which are put
16 silver balls, and nine golden. Those for whom
the <HI>Ballotine</HI> draws the silver balls depart; those that
get the golden remain; and being lockt up together,
they do in the same manner as the former 12, by 7
suffrages chuse 45 of 45 several Families; who after∣wards
being called by the <HI>Signoria</HI> into the Great
Council, the present and absent being all come to∣gether,
as we said before, the Council is dismissed.
And the 45 being set before the <HI>Signoria</HI> in form a∣foresaid,
and called by lot, come up to the <HI>Capello;</HI>
into which are put 34 silver balls, and 11 golden.
Those for whom the silver balls are drawn go at their
pleasure, those for whom the golden, remain; and
having given oath to make a good Election, they are
shut up as the former, and by way of suffrage chuse
41 of so many several Families, of whom each must
<PB N="184" REF="105"/>
have 9 ballots, and these are the Electors of the
<HI>Duke.</HI> After these 41 are thus elected, and in the
Great Council pronounced, and also all met in the
room appointed, in manner aforesaid; first of all
the Mass of the Holy Ghost is celebrated, then eve∣ry
one of the Electors promises by solemn oath to
lay aside all humane passions, and to chuse for <HI>Duke</HI>
him whom to chuse in his conscience he shall judge
to be most for the interest and honour of the Com∣monwealth,
as like to do it most credit and best ser∣vice;
and that with the profoundest silence he will
keep secret whatever is said or done among them.
After this they are lockt up together alone, without
any other Ministers or Secretaries, so close that no
person can be admitted to see them: and first of all
among themselves of the ancientest they chuse three
heads or chiefs which they call <HI>Priors;</HI> and also of the
youngest among them they chuse two who perform
the office of Secretaries. The Priors sit down, having
before them a table upon which are placed two bal∣loting
boxes of that sort that are used in the Great
Council; in one of which are put 40 balls, marked
with a certain mark, that no deceit may be used. The
rest of the 41 sit also down, each where he pleases.
The two Secretaries make 41 Schedules, and having
folded them up give to each person one, they take
also the ballots and distribute them to all. Then they
are called one by one before the three Priors, and
each one writes in his Schedule the name of him
whom he would have to be Duke, and leaves it up∣on
the table. The two Secretaries note the names of
them that are written in the Schedules, and by how
many each one is named. [The names in all the
Schedules seldom pass 6 or 8, because there are never
more who can be judged sit to be promoted
to such a Dignity.] After which all the names so
noted are put into an urn, and thence by lot drawn
out. And he that is first drawn, if he be one of
<PB N="185" REF="105"/>
the Electors is presently sent out into the Chamber
of the <HI>Quarantia,</HI> and there shut up; and liberty is
then given to any one of the Electors to speak any
thing he hath to object against him, why he is not
fit for so great a place. And if any thing be by any
one objected, it is set down by the Secretaries: and
he being called in, all that hath been spoken against
him is read to him, and if he will stand upon his de∣fence
he may make his answer; which when he hath
done he returns into the same Chamber again. The
same order is used till there be none left who will ob∣ject
any thing against him, or till he will defend
himself no longer; after which he is presently bal∣loted,
and as soon as that is done all the Electors go
up before the Priors, the eldest of which with a lit∣tle
staff numbers over those that are in the affirma∣tive
box, and also those that are in the negative;
and if the affirmative amount to 25, the person bal∣loted
is understood to be chosen Duke; and there
can be no other balloted. This order hath been since
changed, and notwithstanding the first or any other
have come to 25 suffrages, yet have the rest been bal∣loted;
and he that hath obtained most suffrages hath
been made Duke. But if the affirmative suffrages
do not amount to 25, there is taken by lot another
out of the urn, in which the names set down each
with the number of its nominators were put, and
the same order of proceeding observed till they come
to one who gets 25 ballots. It may happen that
none comes up to that number, in which case the
Electors continue shut up, and name and ballot the
nominated so often, till one comes to get the fore∣said
number of suffrages. The Duke being on this
wise created, many Ceremonies are wont to be per∣formed.
First of all the 41 by the Great Chancel∣lor
send word to the <HI>Signoria</HI> who it is that is crea∣ted
Duke, who first of all go to congratulate him,
and give him joy; and if it be in the day time,
<PB N="186" REF="106"/>
cause all the Bells to be rung. Then his Kinred and
Friends come to visit him, and at the same time there
is money coined with his name upon it. After
which the 41 Electors with the <HI>Duke</HI> go into St.
<HI>Mark</HI>'s Church, and having done reverence to God,
all mount up a Scaffold, and the ancientest of them
tells the people (who by this time have filled the
Church) that they have chosen a Duke in the room
of the deceased; and commending the Election,
shews him to the People, who in token of confirma∣tion
and joy give him loud acclamations. The Duke
then speaks to the People, and encourages them to
hope well of his Government; which done, they go
down the Scaffold, and bring the Duke before the
Altar; where by the Procurators of the Church an
Oath is tendred him to observe the Laws and a
Standard put into his hand by the Vicar of the <HI>Pri∣micerius</HI>
of St. <HI>Marks.</HI> After this, having made an
offering at the Altar, he comes to the door of the
Choire, where he is placed upon a little low move∣able
Scaffold (<HI>Pergoletta</HI> they call it) accompanied by
one that carries the Standard, and by another of his
near Friends or Relations, who carries a cup full of
gold and silver money stamped with his name; and
by the mariners of the Arsenal he is drawn out of
St. <HI>Marks,</HI> and carried round about the <HI>Piazza,</HI> he
that carries the cup scattering money among the peo∣ple
as he goes along. When he hath rounded the <HI>Pi∣azza,</HI>
he enters in by the principal gate into the Pa∣lace;
where being arrived at the foot of the stairs
he goes off the <HI>Pergolette</HI> to go up. In the midst of
the stairs he finds the Counsellors and <HI>Capi de Qua∣ranta</HI>
who there wait for him. When he is got up
to the top of the stairs, the eldest Counsellor puts
upon his head the Ducal Cap; and thence he is lead
into the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">To put him in mind of his mortality, because that is the place where the Corps of the deceased Dukes lie in state.</NOTE> <HI>Sala de Pioveghi,</HI> and after he hath sitten
<PB N="187" REF="106"/>
a while there in a seat appointed for that purpose, he
is conducted by them to his Lodgings; and the Pa∣lace
being resigned to him, they all go to their own
homes. His habit much differing from the common
renders him venerable. On his head he wears a Du∣cal
Cap, called <HI>il Corno,</HI> because it hath an <HI>Apex</HI>
or horn arising above the top of it on the hinder part,
and under that a white coif, with little strings, which
from the ears hang down backward upon his neck.
On his back a loose vest or mantle without sleeves so
long that it draws upon the ground, of velvet, Da∣mask,
Scarlet, or any other rich cloth. When he goes
abroad the Bells of St. <HI>Marks</HI> are rung: there are
certain Banners carried before him, and Trumpets of
an extraordinary greatness sounded: then follows
the Cushion or Pillow, and the seat of Gold, and after
that the Duke himself under an <HI>Vmbrella,</HI> between
two of the principal forein Embassadors or Agents
then in town, and the others behind him. After him
follow about 30 couple of the chief Gentlemen, all
in cloth of Scarlet; and he that hath the right hand
in the first couple carries a Sword upright in his
hand.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The COVNSELLORS.</HEAD>
<P>The Duke cannot determine, nor so much as ex∣cute
any the least besiness alone without the presence
of the Counsellors, who are in number six, one for
each <HI>Sestiero.</HI> They are always chosen of the most ho∣nourable
Gentlemen of the City; the greatness and
dignity of their office requiring it. They are not all
six chosen at the same time, but by three and three;
those for the three <HI>Sestieri</HI> on one side the Great cha∣nel
at one time, and those for the <HI>Sestieri</HI> on the other
side at another. They are chosen by the Great Coun∣cil,
and are of the number of those Magistrates that
require four Competitors: but the Council of <HI>Pre∣gadi</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="107"/>
for each of these makes one Competitor; who
is afterward balloted in the Great Council. So then
when there is an Election to be made of three Coun∣sellors,
the Great Council is assembled, and after
that the four sets of Electors are made, and with∣drawn
into their several rooms, to make their Ele∣ctions
after the order before set down, one of the
Secretaries gives notice to all who have votes in the
Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> that they withdraw into the
Chamber adjoyning to the Great Council-chamber,
where the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> uses to meet. Where
when they are all met, the Duke with the Counsel∣lors
and <HI>Capi de Quaranta</HI> goes in to them; and it
being by lot determined for what <HI>Sestiero</HI> a Counsel∣lor
shall be first chosen, every one names him whom he
would have to be Counsellor. All the persons nomina∣ted
are written down, and afterwards balloted; and
he that hath more then half the number of suffrages is
cohsen Competitor: and this manner of chusing in
the Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> is called <HI>Scrutinio.</HI> The
Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> and the <HI>Duke</HI> being returned into
the Great Council, and the Competitors made, they
are all balloted after the manner fore-mentioned, and
he that hath most above half the number of suffra∣ges
is understood to be chosen Counsellor. It may
happen that in the Great Council one only may come
to be nominated Competitor, and sometimes the
same that is chosen by the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> in which case he
ought to be balloted; notwithstanding that by the
Law none can be balloted without a Competitor:
because being nominated in divers Councils, he is
understood to be Competitor with himself, as hath
been before intimated; and if he hath more then half
the suffrages he is chosen, [<HI>NB.</HI> Where there are
more Competitors then one balloted for any place
for which the <HI>Pregadi</HI> chuse a Competitor, it hap∣pens
for the most part that he is chosen who was made
Competitor by the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> because of the Dignity
<PB N="189" REF="107"/>
and Reputation of that Council.] The six Counsel∣lors
sit with the <HI>Duke,</HI> and with him administer all
affairs, and dispatch especially all private business:
as for example, give Audience, read publick Letters,
grant Privileges, and the like; which things cannot
be done by the <HI>Duke,</HI> if there be not four Counsellors
present; and yet the Counsellors may dispatch any
the like business, though the Duke be not with them.
They have power of propounding in the Great
Council, the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> and Council
of Ten; which he <HI>Savi</HI> who have power of pro∣pounding
matters in the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> and
the <HI>Capi di Dieci</HI> who have privilege of propound∣ing
in the Council of Ten, have not; so that the
the Authority of the Counsellors is greater then that
of the <HI>Savi,</HI> or <HI>Capi di Dieci.</HI> [<HI>NB.</HI> That any one
Counsellor, though no other concur with him, may
propound in the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> but not in the
Council of Ten, unless three more concur with him
in the same opinion.] This Magistracy continues
for a whole year, but is exercised but 8 months;
the other four months being spent in the <HI>Quarantia
criminale,</HI> wherein three Counsellors continually
sit, who during that time are called <HI>Consiglieri da
basso, i. e.</HI> lower Counsellors. They may sit in this
Court either the first 4 months, or the last 4, or the
two first and two last, And therefore it is necessary
that there be always nine Counsellors, six who sit
constantly with the Duke, and the three now men∣tioned:
and when these are to go sit with the Duke,
or go out of their office, three of those which sit
with the Duke come down to sit in the <HI>Quaranatia</HI> or
finish their office, and there are three new ones crea∣ted.
Moreover it is to be understood, that with
the Duke and six Counsellors do also sit three of the
<HI>Quarantia criminale,</HI> i. e. the 40 Judges in criminal
causes, whom they call <HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI> who hold
this Dignity two months: so that by the <HI>Signoria</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="108"/>
is understood the <HI>Duke,</HI> the six Counsellors, and the
three <HI>Capi di Quaranta.</HI> Anciently the Duke with
his Counsellors was wont to be present at the judg∣ments
of the <HI>Quarantia;</HI> but <HI>Marcus Cornarus</HI> who
was made Duke in the year 1365. by reason of the
multitude of business which daily encreased in the
Commonwealth, left that care to those Counsellors
we have been speaking of. The three <HI>Capi de Qua∣ranta</HI>
sit with the Duke and Counsellors, that as the
<HI>Quarantia</HI> participates with the <HI>Signory,</HI> having three
Counsellors joined with them; so the <HI>Signory</HI> may
partake of the <HI>Quarantia,</HI> the three <HI>Capi de Qua∣ranta</HI>
sitting with them. And so the <HI>Signory</HI> comes
to intermeddle with the business of the <HI>Quarantia,</HI>
and the <HI>Quarantia</HI> with the affairs of the <HI>Signory.</HI>
And now to acquaint the Reader with all the Dukes
management. First, he with the Counsellors inter∣venes
in, and is part of the College, the Council of
<HI>Pregadi,</HI> and the Great Council, as we have already
signified. He is also present in the Council of Ten,
and hath power of propounding in all these Coun∣cils;
so that no affairs can be cannot treated of without his
presence, though alone he cannot dispatch any busi∣ness.
Public Letters are written in his name, as
also all Privileges and publick Writings, as though
he were the Author of them. All Letters that come
from Forein Princes and Embassadors, and Agents
sent abroad by the Commonwealth, are directed to
him. When the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land or Sea, or other
Magistrates write Letters to their Proveditors, they
subscribe them with the Dukes name thus, <HI>Domini∣cus
Contarenus Dux Venetiarum.</HI> And this mode is
observed in all other sorts or public Writings, as
Patents, Privileges, Obligations, Laws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
Council of Ten varies this form and subscribes in
two manners, for either the whole Council writes
and then they subscribe <HI>Dominicus Contarenus Dux
Venetiarum,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>cum nostro Concilio Decem;</HI> and those
<PB N="191" REF="108"/>
that answer superscribe accordingly. Or only the
Heads or Chiefs of the Council of Ten, called <HI>Capi
di Dieci,</HI> write; and then the Subscription is, <HI>Domi∣nicus
Contarenus Dux Venetiarum,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>cum Copitibus
Concilii Decem.</HI> And those that return answer super∣scribe
accordingly. Every eighth day, that is on
Wednesday weekly, the Duke is wont to go down
and visit the Courts of Justice, making a tour round
the two <HI>Corridores,</HI> where the Magistrates sit, stop∣ping
a while at each Court, and stirring up and en∣couraging
the Judge or Magistrate that presides there
to administer Justice impartially. And if there be
any one that thinks he hath not right done him, he
recommends himself to the <HI>Duke,</HI> acquainting him
with his cause; and if the Duke judges that he is in∣jured
by false judgment, he presently commands
that Magistrate or Judge to do him right; but if the
contrary appears to him, he reproves him that
thought himself agrieved, and goes on in his Visita∣tion.
Some Dukes have changed this order, not vi∣siting
always on the same day, that they might come
upon the Mgistrates unexpected. Multitude of bu∣siness
sometimes constrains the Duke to intermit this
usage for a week or two. All the money of the Com∣monwealth
is also stamped with the Dukes name,
but not with his face or image. That he may be the
better enabled (saith my Authour) to maintain his
port, and live with that magnificence such a place
requires, he hath an allowance from the Public of
3500 Ducats <HI>per annum;</HI> a sorry Revenue for one
that hath the shew and Title of a Prince, being less
than so many <HI>French</HI> Crowns. And yet he is obli∣ged
to keep a Family that may be honourable and
suitable to such a Dignity; and moreover to make 4
Feasts yearly at 4 several times, <HI>viz.</HI> upon St. <HI>Ste∣phen</HI>'s
day, St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s day, <HI>Ascension</HI> day, and St.
<HI>Vit</HI>'s day: to which Feasts it is the custom tō invite
all the Gentlemen according to their ages. To the
<PB N="192" REF="109"/>
first, besides the Counsellors, the <HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI>
the Auvogadors, and the <HI>Capi de Dieci,</HI> are invited
those that are of greatest age and gravity: to the
second those that are younger; and so to the third
and fourth still those that are younger and younger:
besides which Feasts, he is bound also to send to eve∣ry
Gentleman that comes to the Great Council a Pre∣sent,
which was formely 5 wild Ducks: but now
adays there is a sort of money coined for that pur∣pose;
upon one side whereof is the figure of St. <HI>Mark</HI>
reaching out a Standard to the Duke, on the other
side the name of the Duke, and the year current of
his Dukeship, on this manner, <HI>Dominici Contareni
Venetiarum Principis munus,</HI> Anno IV.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Council of TEN.</HEAD>
<P>The Council of Ten, though it be a member of
great importance, yet is it rather accessary or adjun∣ctive
then principal, and seems to me much to re∣semble
the <HI>Dictator,</HI> that was wont to be created by
the <HI>Romans</HI> in times of great and imminent danger;
only differs in that the Commonwealth is never
without this Magistracy. The Authority thereof is
equal to that of the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> and the
whole City; and therefore it may meddle with and
transact any State-affairs as it pleases, without appeal,
or being accountable to any Superior Power. Though
this power be not used by it, except only in cases of
greatest importance, and which cannot otherwise be
remedied or provided for: as for example, to con∣sider
about making War, concluding a Peace, or
other negotiation secretly, to send a Proveditor into
the Camp speedily: which things if they should be
first treated of in the College, and afterwards deba∣ted
in the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> they could not be ma∣naged
and transacted with that secresie, expedition,
and other cirumstances as the time and conjuncture
<PB N="193" REF="109"/>
of affairs requires. When the College then intends
to manage any business secretly; as suppose to con∣clude
an agreement with any Prince or State, to at∣tempt
any thing on their enemies, or begin any new
enterprise or design, which ought to be kept secret
till the time of execution, then they cuase Letters to
be written to such Agents or other persons as are
to be employed in that business, with this Inscripti∣on,
<HI>Dominicus Contarenus Dux Venetiarum,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>cum
Concilio nostro Decem:</HI> and they superscribe their an∣swers
in like manner: and their Letters are received
by the <HI>Capi de Dieci,</HI> who bring them to the Col∣lege;
at which time the three <HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI> and
the <HI>Savi di mare</HI> are excluded: and then they treat
of the business, and debate it as long as is needful;
yet not they alone, for the <HI>Capi de Dieci</HI> call the rest
of the Council of Ten. Besides at such consultati∣ons
are present not only the Duke, the Counsellors,
and all the Council of Ten, but the Grand <HI>Savi,</HI>
and the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land, the <HI>Giunta</HI> which consists
of fifteen, the Auvogadors and nine of the Procura∣tors.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>N. Cras∣sus</HI> saith, That at present there are none of any sort added to the Coun∣cil of X, but this Council consists only of the Duke, the six Counsel∣lors, and the <HI>Decemviri;</HI> and that this Council doth not now meddle at all with Peace and War, and the publick Treasury, but only punish enormous Offence, and especially Rebellion and Treason.</NOTE> But all these have not power of giving suf∣frages
but only those ten of the Council of X, the
<HI>Giunta,</HI> the Duke, and the six Counsellors. The
Aggregate of all these united with the Council of X
is called the Council of X with the <HI>Giunta;</HI>
which is not convened but on weighty occasions,
to debate and manage great affairs and such
as appertain to the state of the whole City; which
affairs might be treated of and dispatched by the
Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> but for the respects afore∣said
are undertaken by this Council. The Council
of X was erected some say after the death of <HI>Vitale
Michaeli,</HI> to punish such as had plotted treason against
the Commonwealth. Others say it had its beginning
<PB N="194" REF="110"/>
in the time of <HI>Pietro Gradenigo.</HI> At first its Authority
was but small, but by little and little its reputation
encreased. It punishes besides such as practice Trea∣son
or conspire against the Commonwealth, those
that coin counterfeit monys, those that commit sins
against Nature, as Sodomy and bestiality. It also
disposes of certain moneys which are assigned to it by
the Chamberlains and other Officers: it hath the
command of certain Galleys in the Arsenal, marked
with these two letters, C and X, signifying that such
Vessels are in the power of the <HI>Capi de Dieci.</HI> It also
takes care of the Artillery. When any of these things
are to be considered of, then only those Ten that are
of the Council of X with the Duke and Counsellors
are assembled; and this is called absolutely and sim∣ply
the Council of X. The ten of this Council are
chosen in the Great Council like the other Magi∣strates
for one year; out of which are taken by lot
every month three, who are called the Heads or
Chiefs of the ten [<HI>Capi de Dieci</HI>] and of these one
presides every week, which is he who in the Great
Council-chamber takes place over against the Duke.
The office of these is to convoke the Council of X,
and propound their opinions therein; yet not singly
but all three together, or at least two; and they are
obliged to call the Council every 8 days, and oftner
if occasion require. Anciently there was no deter∣minate
time for assembling this Council, but because
every time it was convened the whole City was mo∣ved
and troubled, as judging that it was not without
some great reason; therefore to avoid and prevent
such disturbance and disquiet of mens minds there
was a time determined for its meeting. When they
are to pass sentence upon any offender that is in their
hands for the forementioned crimes, he cannot ei∣ther
by himself or any other person plead his cause
or defend himself but appears before the Council
and is examined, and there are notes taken of all he
<PB N="195" REF="110"/>
saith. And when the <HI>Capi di Dieci</HI> bring in such a
cause into the Council, either one of them must un∣dertake
his defence and plead for him, or else he
cannot be defended at all. From the Sentence of
this Council there is no appeal, neither can it be re∣versed
or changed but by themselves or successors,
if the matter be such as is capable of change. Those
of this Council so soon as they go out of their of∣fice
may presently enter upon another. For all these
places, the Grand <HI>Savi,</HI> the Savi of the Land and
Savi of the Sea, the Counsellors, the ten of this
Council, the Auvogadors and Censors give no im∣pediment
one to another; but so soon as a Gentle∣man
hath finished one of these Offices, he may enter
upon another. If it happens that any one while he
is exercising a lesser Magistracy be chosen to a greater,
he may if he pleases relinquish the less, and take the
greater.</P>

<HEAD>The Procurators of St. MARK.</HEAD>
<P>The Office of Procurator is of great reputation
in this City. Though it be not of the number of
those which have to do with the administration and
government of the Commonwealth: yet is it ho∣nourable,
because, as that of the Duke, it continues
for life; and is besides ancient, and hath maintained
its Reputation to the present times. There was ne∣ver
any Gentleman of great esteem in the City, but
he was adorned with this Dignity: so that very few
have been Dukes since this Magistracy was ordained
but they have before been <HI>Procurators.</HI> Anciently
there was but one Procurator made, to take care of
the Church of St. <HI>Mark</HI> and its treasure; but after
the death of <HI>Sebastian Ciani,</HI> he having left a great
Legacy to St. <HI>Marks,</HI> the Revenues whereof were to
be distributed by the Procurator; one person not
sufficing for so much business, it was found necessary
<PB N="196" REF="111"/>
to create another; whose charge it should be to su∣perintend
and manage the Legacy of <HI>Sebastian Ciani.</HI>
Afterwards Legacies being multiplied, in the year
1270. in the time of <HI>Rinieri Zeno,</HI> a third was thought
fit to be created; and they did so divide the business
among them, that one took care of the Church, an∣other
of the Legacies bequeathed by them that dwelt
on this side the great Chanel; and the third of their
Legacies who dwelt on the other side of the great
Chanel. In the same Dukes time there was a fourth
created to be Collegue with him that governed the
Church and its Treasures. For the same reason two
more were added when <HI>John Soranzo</HI> was Duke.
Afterwards in the year 1423. when <HI>Francis Foscaro</HI>
was made Duke there were three more created anew;
so that then the whole number was nine; three of
whom took care of the Church and its Treasures;
three of the Legacies of the three <HI>Sestieri</HI> on one side
the great Chanel; and three of the Legacies of the
three <HI>Sestieri</HI> on the other side. In the year 1509.
when the Republics Armies were broken and routed
at <HI>Addua</HI> by <HI>Lewis XII,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> they were
constrained to create six for mony, conferring that
honour upon such as would lend the Commonwealth
such a certain sum. These Procurators have power to
compel Heirs to perform the Wills of the Testators.
They wear Ducal habits, and carry servants about
with them; and have the precedence of all other
Magistrates. In processons the Counsellors and
three <HI>Capi de Quaranta</HI> take place of them. They
have either an habitation assigned them, or 60 Ducats
<HI>per annum</HI> allowed. They all enter into the Coun∣cil
of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> but not all into the Council of Ten,
but only nine chosen by the said Council, three for a
Procuracy. They are not capable of any other Ma∣gistracy,
except that of <HI>Savio grande</HI> and the <HI>Gi∣unta</HI>
of the Council of X. When there is a Captain
of the <HI>Armata,</HI> or a Proveditor of the Camp to be
<PB N="197" REF="111"/>
chosen, there is a Law made in the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> that any
one that is Procurator may obtain that Dignity.
They cannot go to the Great Council, but only in
the Election of the Duke; which license is then
granted them by an especial Law. They were wont
anciently upon all those days the Great Council met,
during all the time the Council sate, to continue in
the Court of the Palace, and never to depart thence
till the Great Council was risen; that if any unex∣pected
or suddain accident should happen they might
be ready to remedy or assist. And this perchance was
the reason that it was forbidden them to go to the
Great Council. But in our time this usance is not ob∣served,
because of that quiet and tranquility the
Commonwealth enjoys: Which is such, that no
man thinks there can any accident happen in the City
which shall require the presence of the Procurators
more is one place than in another. There is no Ma∣gistracy
or Dignity in the City of much desired by the
Gentlemen as this of Procurator: Yet I think that
it hath lost much of its ancient reputation. For
whereas formerly it was not wont to be granted to
any but ancient men, and great repute; in our
times we have seen many adorned therewith, who
were neither of mature age, nor great esteem and
credit.</P>
<P>Of the other Officers and Magistrates (whereof
this Republic hath good store) I shall say nothing, they
belonging rather to the administration of Justice
and particular civil affairs, then the Government of
the Commonwealth. Only it is worth the notice ta∣king,
that they have so many Offices divided among
the Gentlemen, to busie and employ the greater num∣ber
of them, that so having something to entertain
their time with, they may not be at leisure to think
upon innovating in the Government, or any way de∣sign
and practice against the constitution of the
Commonwealth, to the disturbance of the peace.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="112"/>
The Gentlemen while they are in the City wear
black Gowns with narrow sleeves, and caps; with∣out
which habit they never appear in the streets, or
any public place. In the <HI>Piazza</HI> of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> that side
next the Great Council-chamber is appropriated to
them to walk in, where no others mingle with them.
This walk, or rather the company of Gentlemen
walking together there; they call the Broil [<HI>Broglio.</HI>]
The principal diversion of the Gentlemen, Citizens,
and Strangers is to walk in this <HI>Piazza.</HI></P>
<P>The present Citizens of what quality or estate so∣ever
have no share or interest at all in the Govrern∣ment
of the Commonwealth. Probable it is, that
when the Creat Council was shut up (as they phrase
it) that is, determined to such a number of Families
excluding all the rest, that all the Citizens of any
quality were therein comprehended; because before
that time the Government having been common to
all, it is not likely the present establishment would
have taken place without commotion and distur∣bance,
if there had been a considerable number of
Citizens of fashion and interest left out. Formerly
this honour hath been given to many Citizens of
eminent merit. Lately since the Wars with the
Turks in <HI>Candy</HI> for 100000 Ducats any Citizen
might be created Nobleman▪ By which means the
State raised millions of Ducats there ha∣ving
been more then fourscore Families advanced to
that Dignity.</P>
<P>They put not weapons into the Citizens hands,
but chuse rather to make use of mercenary Souldiers
in their Wars.</P>
<P>There is no Law that prohibits any Citizen to be
chosen to any place or Office by the Great Council,
nor doth there need it: For that they are as sure not
to be cosen as though there were such a Law, the
interest of the Nobility being as strong a bar to such
a choice as Law would be. And yet <HI>Gianotti</HI> saith,
<PB N="199" REF="112"/>
that some have attained to be nominated and balloted
in the Great Council.</P>
<P>The air, notwithstanding the situation of the Ci∣ty,
is held to be very good and healthful, and (which
is more) agreeable to people of all countreys and
tempers. We never enjoyed our health better, nor
had better stomachs to our meat in any place beyond
the Seas then we had heer.</P>
<P>Heer we first saw the <HI>Ludicrum,</HI> called by some
<HI>Diabolus in carc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re,</HI> from a little hollow glass-image
made like the Picture of the Devil (though a glass-bubble
would serve the purpose as well or better)
which being put into a cylindrical glass-tube full of
water they could make ascend, descend or rest in any
part of the tube at pleasure. The manner thus, They
prepare an <HI>icuncula</HI> or glass-bubble hollow and ha∣ving
in the heavier end of it a little hole of such a
poise as just to ascend and swim in water, and having
put it into a glass-tube stopt close or sealed at one
end, and almost full of water, they clap their hand
on the mouth of the tube, and press down the air
upon the <HI>superficies</HI> of the water. The water being
thus prest, presses upon the air in the <HI>icuncula</HI> or
bubble; which giving place, part of the water thrusts
into it by the little hole. The bubble thereupon be∣coming
heavier sinks in the water. Then taking up
the hand and removing the force, the air in the
<HI>icuncula</HI> or bubble by its elastic power expands it
self, and expelling the water again, the <HI>icuncula</HI> or
bubble ascends; and so by proportioning the force
they can make it not only ascend and descend from
top to bottom, but rest at what point of height or
depth they please. Of this and other ludicrous ex∣periments
concerning the motion of these bubbles,
I shall not think much heer to set down what Doctor
<HI>Cornelius</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> hath delivered in his <HI>Progymnas∣mata
Physica,</HI> Epist. de <HI>Circumpulsione Platonica</HI> I
was (saith he) informed by <HI>Lud. Casalius</HI> of an expe∣riment
<PB N="200" REF="113"/>
invented at <HI>Florence, viz.</HI> Two glass-bubbles
being put into a vessel of water were so alternately
moved, that in cold water the one sank to the bot∣tom,
the other swam on the top; but putting in a
little hot water they changed places, that at the bot∣tom
ascending up to the top, and that on the top
sinking down to the bottom. Being taken with the
novity of the thing, I applyed my mind to consider
what might be the Physical reson of it, and soon
found out how it might be effected, to wit, one of
these Glass-bubbles was perforated with a little hole
on the heavier side, and blown so light as to swim in
water: then some of the air being suckt out, there
was so much water let in in the room thereof, as to
make the bubble sink in cold water, which upon fil∣ling
the Vessel with hot water would mount up to the
top. For the air in the bubble being rarefied or dila∣ted
by the heat of the water presently expells the
water contained in the bubble, and so the bubble be∣coming
lighter ascends, The other glass-bubble is
imperforate and made of that poise as to swim in
cold water and sink in hot. He goes on.</P>

<P>A Nobleman of this City shewed us a Boy, who
had a faculty of charging his belly with wind, and
discharging it again backward at pleasure; which we
saw him perform. When he charged himself he
lay upon his hands and knees, and put his head on
the ground almost between his legs.</P>
<P>The same Nobleman shewed us the experiment,
and gave us the receipt of a fulminating powder,
which will do almost as well as that chargeable one
made of gold. Take of salt of Tartar one part, of com∣mon
Brimstone two parts, of Nitre or Salt-peter three
parts; put these three all at once into a Mortar, beat
them fine and mingle them well together. Take of
this powder and put it on a plate of iron, or in a fire∣pan
or other vessel, and hold it over a flame of fire
or a pan of charcoal: When the powder begins to
melt, it will explode with a very smart crack like to
<HI>Aurum fulminans.</HI> The same or the like fulmina∣ting
powder hath been since shewn us by Mr. <HI>Fisher</HI>
of <HI>Sheffield.</HI> It is not unlikely that there may be se∣veral
sorts of powder made, which shall explode
and fulminate after this fashion.</P>
<P>The same Gentleman also shew'd us the whole
process of making <HI>Venice-Sope,</HI> which is very like
and nothing inferiour to <HI>Castile-Sope.</HI> It is made
of the best Oil Olive, and a <HI>lixivium</HI> or Lye. The
<HI>lixivium</HI> is thus made. They take of the ashes of
<HI>Kali,</HI> made in <HI>Spain,</HI> and in <HI>England</HI> known by the
name of <HI>Beriglia,</HI> two thirds, of <HI>Kelp, i. e.</HI> the ashes
of the ordinary Sea-wrack one third. These they
<PB N="203" REF="114"/>
break into small pieces with a mallet or hammer,
and mingle well together. This done they put them
into a mill, such as we grind apples in to make Cider,
and grind them to powder, and then sift them. This
powder they mingle with a little slaked lime, and
make it up into pellets, which they put into letches
or troughs, and pouring water upon them make
the <HI>Lixivium.</HI> The Cauldrons wherein they boil their
Sope are very large. The bottom of them is a copper
vessel, but the sides are made up of stone close ce∣mented
together, bound about with iron hoops, and
enclosed in a case of Wood. Into these Cauldrons
they put a great quantity of Oil, it may be one
third part of the measure, or more or less as they
please: then they fill them up with the <HI>lixivium,</HI> and
putting fire under it, cause it to boil continually; as
the <HI>lixivium</HI> boils away still filling it up with new, till
all the oil be consumed or boiled out of it. For the
oil uniting it self with the salt of the <HI>lixivium</HI> rises
continually up to the top in the form of a scum or
froth, which by degrees grows thicker and thicker,
and by reason of the cold of the air condenses into
that body we call Sope. This scum continues to rise
so long as there is any oil remaining in the vessels;
the cremor or coat of Sope growing still thicker.
Those that are practised can tell by the smell when
all the oil is boiled away. The <HI>lixivium</HI> they account
strong enough so long as it will bear an egg. This
<HI>lixivium</HI> they make of Sea water, but they told us
they might as well make it of fresh water. To ex∣pedite
the making the <HI>lixivium,</HI> they take some of
the boiling <HI>lixivium</HI> out of the Cauldrons; to which
purpose there is a pipe comes out of the Cauldron in
the region of the <HI>lixivium,</HI> whereby they let out the
boiling <HI>lixivium</HI> into a trough; and this together
with cold water they pour upon the ashes to promote
the separation of the salt. When the oil is boil'd
away they let all cool, and taking the <HI>cremor</HI> or crust
<PB N="204" REF="115"/>
of Sope off the superficies of the liquor, spread it
upon a floor, and smooth it, and so let it dry in a
bed of more then a bricks thickness. When it is
dried they cut it long ways and cross ways into ob∣long
parallelograms, or the figure of oblong bricks,
there being nicks in the borders of the beds on pur∣pose
to direct the instruments to cut it. This done
they pare these pieces from any impurities that may
adhere to them from the bottom of the bed, (For the
beds are all strowed with Lime-dust to hinder the
sticking of the Sope to the floor) and run them over
a plane, to smooth them. These large pieces they
subdivide into lesser, and seal them with a Seal.</P>
<P>The reason why they mix <HI>Kelp</HI> with the <HI>Beriglia,</HI>
is because <HI>Beriglia</HI> alone would make the Sope too
soft, and <HI>Kelp</HI> alone too brittle.</P>
<P>To colour the Sope green they take the juyce of
Beet, a good quantity, and put it into the Cauldron
with the <HI>lixivium</HI> and oyl. The <HI>Germans</HI> will have
it thus coloured, and perhaps the Nitre which is in
this juyce may add some vigour to the Sope.</P>
<P>The fire is continually kept burning, and so the
liquor boiling till the operation be finished.</P>

reserved only for corn. There are very few Me∣dows

The Citizens and Strangers heer dare not stir
abroad in the dark for fear of the Scholars and
others, who walk up and down the Streets most
part of the night, armed with Pistols and Carbines.
If any one comes within hearing, they cry <HI>Che va li?</HI>
i. e. Who goes there? and if they answer, they bid
them turn back; which if they do not suddenly do,
they shoot at them. When two parties of these Scho∣lars
meet, each man standing behind a pillar (for the
streets have Portico's or Cloysters on each side) they
shoot one at another. These <HI>Martenalia noctur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> as
some call them, or <HI>Che va li's</HI> are thought to have

<P><HI>Padua</HI> is governed by a <HI>Padestà</HI> or Maior, who is
chief in civil matters; and a <HI>Capitaneo</HI> or Governour
who is over the Military; both elected and sent by
the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Padua</HI> we made a by-journey to <HI>Albano,</HI> an∣ciently
<HI>Apo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> some 5 miles distant, where we view∣ed
the hot baths. The Springs arise in a rocky hillock,
consisting of a porous stone, and are so plentiful that
one of them drives an overshot mill. The water is so
hot, that in one of the sources, the Countrey-people
usually scald their hogs to get off the hair. It contains
a copious white salt which shoots upon the earth
where the water runs. This the common people
heerabout gather, and use with their meat, which
<PB N="216" REF="121"/>
yet hath not the true tast of common falt, but some∣what
approaching to Nitre or Salt-armon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ac. Besides
it is so impregnate with stone, (which by reason of
the salt it contains actuated by the heat, it dissolves
and imbibes in the stone quarries it passeth through)
that it suddainly precipitates it on the bottoms and
sides of the Chanels wherein it runs, which become
thereby as it were so many stone troughs; and on
the mill-wheel it drives, which it so encrusts with
a stone of a dark gray colour, that every other month
they are fain to peck it off. That the waters which
petrifie<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Such as are those of <HI>Pool-hole</HI> in <HI>Derby∣shire, Wo∣key-hole</HI> in <HI>Som∣merset∣shire</HI> and other subterra∣neous grots as well in <HI>England</HI> as be∣yond the Seas. <HI>Febr.</HI> 3.</NOTE> do by running through stone-quarries wash
off small <HI>ramenta</HI> or particles, and being in motion
support them, and when they stand or settle in any
place let them fall again, is more than probable, by
what we see in daily experience, the hardest stones
being worn and hollowed by a constant dropping of
water upon them: much more will water be able to
do this, when impregnate with salt, and that salt
actuated by heat. The waters of <HI>Albano</HI> are not
made use of to drink, but only to bathe in, as at
<HI>Aken, Baden,</HI> &amp;c. though <HI>Schottus</HI> saith that they
usually drink of one of the sources.</P>
<P>We travelled to <HI>Vicenza,</HI> a City less in circuit than
<HI>Padua,</HI> as being but 4 miles round, but more popu∣lous,
containing between 30 and 40 thousand souls.
It is encompassed with a Brick-wall, but of no great
strength. It stands upon the River <HI>Bacchilio,</HI> and is al∣so
watered by the <HI>Rero</HI> or <HI>Eretenus,</HI> beside two little
Brooks called <HI>Astichello</HI> and <HI>Seriola.</HI> It is full of No∣bility
and Gentry, being said to have 200 Families
worth 1500 crowns <HI>per annum</HI> each, and better. So
that there is a Proverb in <HI>Italy, Quanti ha Venetia de
Ponti &amp; Gondalieri, Tanti ha Vicenza de Conti &amp; Ca∣valieri.</HI></P>
<P>Of the several changes of Government which
this City hath undergone I shall say nothing, but for
that refer the Reader to <HI>Schottus</HI> and <HI>Leander-Al∣bertus:</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="121"/>
Only it is worth the notice taking, that when
they were set at liberty, and absolved of their Oaths
of Allegiance by <HI>Catharine</HI> relict of <HI>Galeazzo Visconte</HI>
first Duke of <HI>Milan,</HI> they did of their own accord
deliver up themselves to the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> for
which reason they enjoy great privileges and immu∣nities.
The Theater of the Academy called the <HI>Olym∣pici</HI>
is a pretty building and deserves to be remem∣bred.
The Inhabitants of this City drive a great
trade in breeding and feeding of Silk-worms, and
in winding, twisting, and dying of silk. The Wines
of this Territory are very rich and gustful, especially
that sort called <HI>Dolce &amp; piccante.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we made an excursion of about 6 miles, to
see the famous Cave of <HI>Custoza,</HI> said by some to be
seven miles in length; but more truly by <HI>Jo. Georgi∣us
Trissinus</HI> (who himself measured it, and gives an
account of it in a Letter to <HI>Leander Albertus</HI>) no
more then 650 perches, which make about 4000
feet in length, 490 perches or 3000 foot in breadth,
and about three miles in circuit. We took it to be
nothing else but a Cave left from the digging of
stone; as the same <HI>Trissinus</HI> by sufficient arguments
proves it to be. 1. Because the ancient buildings of
<HI>Padua</HI> and <HI>Vicenza</HI> are of the same kind of stone.
2. Because to support the roof they have every where
at distances sometimes greater, sometimes less, left
huge pilasters of the quarry, of 3 perches square a∣piece;
of which pilasters in the whole cave there are
thought to be about 1000. 3. There are some great
square pieces of stone cut round about, in order to
taking them up and carrying them away. 4. There
remain manifest prints and tracks of cart-wheels;
whereas no man living can remember that ever cart
went in there.</P>
<P>We observed many Bats clinging to the roof and
walls of this Cave; and in some standing waters a
kind of fish or rather insect, which they called
<PB N="218" REF="122" MS="y"/>
<HI>Squillae Venetianae</HI> i. e. Venice-shrimps, but they are
of that sort which naturalists call <HI>Pulices marini</HI> or
<HI>aquatici,</HI> i. e. Sea-fleas or water-fleas.</P>
<P>At this Village we saw the so much talked of Ven∣tiduct
belonging to one <HI>Tridentus</HI> a Nobleman of
<HI>Vicenza,</HI> serving to cool the rooms of his Palace in
Summer time. From a large high-rooft subterrane∣ous
grot or cave there are Chanels cut out of the rock
to the Palace. When they would have a cool air in
any of the rooms, they shut up a gate in the cave,
and open a door at the end of the Chanel, which lets
in the <HI>fresco,</HI> every room having a hole in the wall
or pavement to admit it. On a stone there is this in∣scription,
<HI>Franciscus Tridenteus Vicentius JCtus

<P>From <HI>Vicenza</HI> we journeyed to <HI>Verona,</HI> a fair,
large, populous City, pleasantly situate upon the Ri∣ver
<HI>Athesis,</HI> which is heer of a great breadth, over
which there is one very fair stone-bridge esteemed
the handsomest Bridge in <HI>Europe,</HI> besides 3 others of
less account. The City is 7 miles in circuit, exclu∣ding
the Suburbs, which are very large too; and
thought to contain 70000 souls. It is strong by si∣tuation,
and extraordinarily fortified with walls,
bastions, towers, bulwarks, and deep ditches full of
water drawn from the River <HI>Athesis</HI> round about,
and strengthened with 3 Castles; that of St. <HI>Peter,</HI>
that of St. <HI>Felix,</HI> and so that it is
lookt upon as impregnable. Heer we saw several Ca∣binets
or Collections of natural and artificial rari∣ties.
<PB N="219" REF="122" MS="y"/>
1. That of Seignior <HI>Mapheus Cusanus</HI> an Apo∣thecary,

Idols, taken out of the Mummies, divers sorts
of petrified shells, petrified cheese, cinnamon, spunge
and Mushromes. A Jasper stone and an Agate having

besides modern medals. A stone called <HI>Oculus mundi,

when put into water, grows clear and transparent.
An account of this stone may be seen in the <HI>History of
the Royal Society,</HI> brought in by Dr. <HI>Goddard.</HI> Among
his Medals we observed a <HI>Maximinian</HI> and a <HI>Diocle∣sian,</HI>
with this on the reverse inscribed, <HI>Verona Am∣phitheatrum.</HI></P>
<P>2. That of Seignior <HI>Muscardo,</HI> a Gentleman of
<HI>Verona,</HI> a civil and obliging person. He also hath a
very good collection of ancient <HI>Roman</HI> medals, among
which he shew'd us an <HI>Otho</HI> of Gold, and told us
that those of brass were all counterfeit, there ha∣ving
never been any found of that metal. Many
sorts of lachrymal Urns and Lamps, great variety of
Shells and some fruits and parts of plants petrified.
Several exotic fruits and seeds: the ores of metals
and minerals: Gems and precious stones in their
matrices as they grew: <HI>Lapis obsidianus</HI> and a kind
of stone called <HI>Adar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI> But because there is a de∣scription
of this <HI>Museum</HI> published in <HI>Italian,</HI> I shall

thither.</P>
<P>3. The <HI>Museum</HI> of Seignior <HI>Mario Sala</HI> an Apo∣thecary,
containing only some reliques of <HI>Calceolarius</HI>
his <HI>Museum,</HI> printed many years ago.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="123"/>
The <HI>Amphitheater</HI> of <HI>Verona,</HI> called now the <HI>Are∣na,</HI>
is a very stately and capacious one, and seem'd
to me when it was entire not to have been much in∣feriour
either for beauty or greatness to that of <HI>Titus</HI>
at <HI>Rome.</HI> The outward wall or circle is all gone save
a little piece, from whence we may make an estimate
of the heighth and beauty of the whole. The remain∣der
setting aside this exteriour circle is kept in good
repair by the <HI>Veronese;</HI> the <HI>Arena</HI> of it is 34<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The length of a <HI>per∣tica</HI> or perch of this mea∣sure is some∣what more than 6 foot.</NOTE> <HI>pertiche</HI>
long and 22 ½ broad, and compassed about by 42
rows of stone benches one above another, after the
manner of stairs, upon which 23000 persons may sit
commodiously. As it is imperfect it seemed to us one
of the most pleasant and goodly spectacles for a
structure of that nature that ever we beheld. He that
desires a more full and particular description of it
may consult <HI>Schottus,</HI> and the Antiquities of <HI>Verona</HI>

almost the same changes with <HI>Padua</HI> and <HI>Vi∣cenza,</HI>
and did also voluntarily, deliver it self up to
the <HI>Venetian</HI> Government. Heer are very good white
Wines, especially that sort they call <HI>Garganico.</HI> The
air is clear and healthful, but must needs be sharp in
Winter time, being so near the high mountains:
among which <HI>Baldus</HI> is famous for the great variety
of choice simples growing thereon, of which <HI>Joan.
Pona</HI> an Apothecary of <HI>Verona</HI> hath written a parti∣cular
Catalogue and description. Which Book and
thereupon the <HI>Paduan</HI> herbarists making simpling
voyages yearly thither hath gotten <HI>Baldus</HI> its repu∣tation,
for I am very confident that many hills about
the <HI>Alps</HI> produce as great variety and as choice plants
as that.</P>
<P>Not for from <HI>Verona</HI> is the <HI>Lago di Garda</HI> ancient∣ly
called <HI>Lacus Benacus,</HI> which furnishes the City
with plenty of excellent Fish, especially trouts, <HI>Sar∣dinie,</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="123"/>
and a sort of Fish of the Trout kind, called
<HI>Carpione,</HI> peculiar to this lake. Those we saw were
not a foot long, of the fashion of Trout.</P>
<P>We travelled from <HI>Verona</HI> to <HI>Mantua</HI> 24 miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Febr. 9.</NOTE>
by the way passing through some large Villages, but
no considerable Town.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mantua.</NOTE> Six miles short of <HI>Mantua,</HI>
at a place called <HI>Marmirola,</HI> we viewed an elegant
palace of the Dukes, richly furnished and adorned
with pictures and statues. The City of <HI>Mantua</HI> is of
great antiquity, strong by situation, as standing in
the middle of a lake, and well fortified. <HI>Schottus</HI>
saith that it is 4 miles in circuit, hath 8 gates, and
about 50000 souls. It seemed to us a great City, but
not answerably populous, having not yet recovered it
self of the losses it sustained when it was miserably
sackt by the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI> II. his Army in the
year 1630. A little out of the City stands a pretty
house of the Dukes called <HI>Palazzo del Te,</HI> wherein
there is a square room having the roof arched round
in form of <HI>Cupola,</HI> called the <HI>Giants-hall,</HI> so con∣trived,
that if two stand in the opposite corners,
one laying his ear to the wall may hear what the
other whispers with his face to the corner, which he
that stands in the middle of the room or in the cor∣ner
on the same side shall not. The like room we
were told there is in the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI>'s Palace at
<HI>Caprarola.</HI> Our whispering place in the Cathedral
Church of <HI>Glocester</HI> is of somewhat a different make.
In a Village near <HI>Mantua</HI> called <HI>Ande,</HI> now <HI>Petula,</HI>
was born the Prince of <HI>Latine</HI> Poets, P. <HI>Virgilius
Maro.</HI> In this City are two Societies of <HI>Virtuosi</HI> (Aca∣demies
they call them) the one stile themselves <HI>Ac∣cesi,</HI>
the other <HI>Timidi.</HI></P>
<P>This City hath according to the fate of her neigh∣bours
undergone several changes of Government.
In the year 1328. <HI>Lewis Gonzaga</HI> by the favour of the
people made himself Lord of it, from whom the
<PB N="222" REF="124"/>
present Duke is descended. In the year 1433. <HI>John-Francis
Gonzaga</HI> was created Marquess of <HI>Manina,</HI>
by the Emperor <HI>Sigismund</HI> IV. In the year 1530.
<HI>Frederic Gonzaga</HI> was created Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> by the
Emperor <HI>Charles V.</HI></P>
<P>The Dukes yearly revenue is said to be 400000
crowns, according to the account we had of it in
particulars somewhat less, <HI>viz.</HI> the mills pay 4000
crowns <HI>per annum.</HI> The Jews (who are about 6000
in number, and wear no badge of distinction) give
20000 crowns <HI>per annum.</HI> The rest of the Citizens
of <HI>Mantua</HI> 70000 crowns. The Countrey yields
60000 pistols; and <HI>Montserrat</HI> 13000, in all 386000
crowns the year. Yet is the present Prince, through
ill husbandry not proportioning his expences to his
income, become very poor, being indebted to the
<HI>Venetians</HI> (as <HI>Leti</HI> saith) four millions of crowris.
To advance his Revenue at the time of our being
there he was put to that pitiful shift of debasing his
coin, so that none of his money would pass further
then his own Territory. His name was <HI>Carolus Gon∣zaga</HI>
II. since dead, and his Son <HI>Caroulus Ferdinandus</HI>
succeeds him in his estates. There are besides of this
Family 4 or 5 small Princes, feudatory of the Em∣pire,
but Sovereign Lords having <HI>Jura Regalia</HI> in
their petty States, <HI>viz.</HI> The Princes of 1. <HI>Novellara.
2. Bozolo.</HI> 3. <HI>Gustalla.</HI> 4. <HI>Sabionetta,</HI> in which
the male line is failed. 5. <HI>Castiglione.</HI> We were told
that these Princelets were obliged to attend the Duke
of <HI>Mantua</HI>'s Court three months in the year. The
Dukes Council of State or Privy Council consists on∣ly
of six of the chief Nobility.</P>
<P>In these parts all the children of the common peo∣ple
have equal shares of their Parents Estates, at least
their moveables. The wife when her husband dies
carries her dowry back with her: if she dies first,
then her children (if she leaves any) divide her dower
equally among them. If she die childless her dower
<PB N="223" REF="124"/>
is divided, half goes to her husband, and half to her
next kindred. If a woman hath had children by one
husband and he dying she marries again and hath
children by her second husband, her estate is divided
into equal parts, one moiety goes to her first hus∣bands
children, and the other to her second's.</P>
<P>We took boat for <HI>Ferrara,</HI> which brought us first
into the lake, then into the chanel of the River Min∣cius,
[which runs out of the <HI>Lago di Garda</HI> (called
in <HI>Latine Lacus Benacus</HI>) at a strong Fort of the <HI>Ve∣netians</HI>
called <HI>Peschiera,</HI> and coming to <HI>Mantua</HI>
spreads it self into a lake of 5 miles long.] At 16
miles end we came to a Bridg and Sluce at a place cal∣led
<HI>Governo,</HI> where we entred the River <HI>Po;</HI> going
down stream we passed by <HI>Ostia</HI> 10 miles distant
from <HI>Governo;</HI> and 10 miles further down <HI>Massa,</HI> both
on our left hand; and 7 miles below <HI>Massa</HI> came to
<HI>Stellata,</HI> a large Village on our right hand, under
the Pope. Heer the Territory of <HI>Mantua</HI> ended.
Eight miles beyond this place we left the River <HI>Po</HI> at
a Village called <HI>Il Ponte,</HI> and struck up an artificial
Chanel of 4 miles long, which brought streight to
the Gates of <HI>Ferrara.</HI></P>
<P>This City is very considerable as well for its
greatness as its strength. It is said to be about 7
miles in compass, and besides the advantage of its si∣ruation
in a fenny level it is strongly fortified with
walls an bulwarks, and surrounded with a broad
and deep trench full of water; so that I look upon
it for a City of that bigness as the strongest in all
<HI>Italy.</HI> It had formerly a Prince of its own, but is
now, with all its territory, subject to the <HI>Pope.</HI> From
<HI>Ferrara</HI> we went with the <HI>Procaccio</HI> or Courrier to
<HI>Bologna,</HI> shifting our boat at a place called <HI>Mal-Al∣bergo,</HI>
some 17 miles from <HI>Ferrara,</HI> where we went
up into a higher chanel, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Rhenus Bononiensis,</HI>
and passing through 9 locks or <HI>sostegni,</HI> we arrived
at <HI>Bologna,</HI> distant by water from <HI>Ferrara</HI> 45 miles.
<PB N="224" REF="125"/>
A great part of the Countrey we passed through be∣tween
<HI>Ferrara</HI> and <HI>Bologna.</HI> is a perfect level, and fen∣ny
ground, much like to the Isle of <HI>Ely</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bononia</HI> is a large City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bologna</NOTE> of a round figure, and yet
7 or 8 miles in circuit. The houses not tall, fair por∣tico's
on each side the streets, convenient to walk in,
as well in Summer to defend one from the scorching
beams of the Sun, as in Winter to shelter form the
rain. Many Gentlemens houses (palaces they call
them) which make no great shew outwardly in the
street, but within are very handsome and very con∣venient,
having more in the <HI>recess</HI> then they pro∣mise
in the <HI>front.</HI> The number of Inhabitants is
about 80000 souls. The <HI>Bologna</HI> sausages, wash∣balls,
and little dogs are much esteemed and talked
of in all <HI>Italy</HI> and elsewhere. Heer is also a great
silk trade driven, and the best Engines for winding
and twisting of it that we have any where seen. The
University of <HI>Bologna</HI> is one of the most ancient and
famous in <HI>Europe,</HI> especially for the study of the Law.
There is such a multitude of professors in all faculties,
that I am afraid few Readers will have the patience
to run over the list of them, which for the satisfa∣ction
of the curious I here exhibit.</P>

<P>At <HI>Bononia</HI> we saw the formerly famous exercise
of Justing or Tilting, which is there stil used in
Carneval time. The combatants being mounted on
horseback, armed cap-a-pee, and adorned with
huge Plumes of Feathers and Scarfs, with Launces
in their hands, run one at another a full gallop, one on
one side and another on the other side of a low rail.
They aim at one particular part (I think it is the eye)
and he that comes nearest is the best Juster. We
saw several Launces broken but no person dismoun∣ted,
nor any hurt done.</P>
<P>Heer by the favour of Dr. <HI>Ovidio Montalbano</HI> one
of the Professors, we had a sight of the <HI>Museum</HI>
of <HI>aldrovandus,</HI> which by his last Will he left as a
Legacy to the City. It is kept in the Cardinal Le∣gates
Palace commonly called <HI>Palazzo del Confalo∣niero.</HI>
Among many natural and artificial Rarities
therein preserved we took more especial notice of 10
Volumes of the pictures of Plants, and 6 of Birds,
Beasts, and Fishes, drawn exactly in colours by the
hand.</P>
<P>The same Dr. <HI>Montalbanus</HI> very civilly brought

us to the house of <HI>Jcaobus Zenoni,</HI> an Apothecary, a
skilful herbarist and a collector of Rarities, who
among other things shewed us three pieces of rock-Crystal,
with drops of water enclosed in the middle
of them, which we could plainly perceive when the
crystal was moved to and fro. He hath a Garden
well stored with Simples, wherein we noted <HI>Arun∣do

others which had not yet put forth, it being early in
the Spring.</P>
<P>The same day we visited Seignior <HI>Gioseppi Bucemi</HI>
a Chymist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>La∣pis Phos∣phorus</HI> or shining stone.</NOTE> who prepares the <HI>Bononian</HI> stone, or <HI>Lapis
Phosphorus,</HI> which id exposed a while to the illumi∣nated
air will imbibe the light, so that withdrawn
into a dark room, and there look't upon it will ap∣pear
like a burning coal; but in a short time gradu∣ally
loses its shining till again exposed to the light.
The crude stone is like a kind of sparre or <HI>fluor;</HI> it
acquires this quality by being calcined (ad he told us)
in any small furnace, laying the pieces of stone upon
an iron grate over a fire of wood. But we believe
<PB N="236" REF="131" MS="y"/>
there is somewhat more of mystery in it; for some of
us calcining part of the stone we purchased of him ac∣cording
to his direction, it sorted not to make it shine.
The prepared stone in time loses its vertue and ceases
to shine, as we found by experience in those pieces we
bought and brought along with us. Heerabout and all
along as we rode in <HI>Lombardy</HI> we saw now in flower
<HI>Aconitum hyemale,</HI> call'd by same <HI>Anemone Bononiensium</HI></P>
<P>We left <HI>Bologna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 22.</NOTE> and travelled to <HI>Modena,</HI> by
the way about 15 miles from <HI>Bol</HI> pssing by <HI>Castel-Franco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Castel France.</NOTE>
a strong Fort near a Village called <HI>Villa
Franca,</HI> built by Pope <HI>Vrban</HI> the VIII. on the Frontier
of <HI>Modena.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Modena.</NOTE> <HI>Modena</HI> is 20 miles distant from <HI>Bono∣nia,</HI>
no great City, but for the bigness populous, be∣ing
the place of the Dukes usual residence; which
must needs draw company and business. It is encom∣passed
about with a thick wall and broad ditch, and
tolerably well fortified with bastions and outworks.
Heer as at <HI>Bononia, Padua,</HI> and several other Cities
in <HI>Lombardy</HI> and <HI>Friuli,</HI> are <HI>Portico's</HI> or Cloysters,
(Rows they call them at <HI>Chester</HI>) on each side the
streets to walk in. The houses are most built of brick,
and but of mean height, as we observed them to be
in all those Cities where the streets cloystered
on both sides, which we conjecture was the manner
of building of the <HI>Goths</HI> or <HI>Lombards</HI> that invaded
<HI>Italy,</HI> and setled themselves in these parts.</P>
<P>Heer we saw the Dukes Palace, which though it
be not vast, nor makes any great shew outwardly;
yet are the rooms within very elegant and richly
adorned with gilding, hangings, and Pictures of
the best Masters. What we most minded was the
Cabinet or <HI>museum,</HI> furnished with choice of natural
Rarities, Jewels, ancient ad modern Coins and Me∣dals,
ancient and modern Entaglia's, curious turn'd
Works, dried Plants pasted upon smooth boards
whitened with ceruss, which may be put in frames
and hung about a room like pictures; and a great
<PB N="237" REF="131" MS="y"/>
collection of designs of the best Painters. Among
other things we took notice of a humane head pe∣trified;
a hens egg having on one side the signature
of the Sun, which I the rather noted, because some
years before Sir <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> of <HI>Norwich</HI> sent me the
picture of one having the perfect signature of a Duck
swimming upon it, which he assured me was natural.
Moss included in a piece of Crystal, silver in another.
A fly plainly discernable in a piece of Amber. A Chi∣nese
Calendar written on wooden leaves. <HI>Almericus</HI>
Father to the present Duke (who at our being there
was a child of about 3 years old) made this Collecti∣on,
and was treating with <HI>Manfredus Septalius</HI> Ca∣non
at <HI>Millain</HI> for his Cabinet, so much talked of all
over <HI>Italy;</HI> for which they told us he was to give
1000 pistols: But before the bargain was concluded
the Duke died in the 28 year of his age.</P>
<P>The Revenues of this Prince are said to be 350000
Crowns <HI>per ann.</HI> his ordinary expences not to exceed
180000.</P>
<P>In a Mountain in this Territory called <HI>Zibbo</HI> nigh
<HI>Paiuli</HI> Castle some 28 miles distant from <HI>Modena</HI> is a
Fountain where <HI>Petroleum</HI> issues out of the earth. In
another Mountain called <HI>Monte Nicani</HI> are found pe∣tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied
cockles and others shells.</P>
<P>We began our Journey to <HI>Parma,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 24.</NOTE> and at 7 miles
end forded the River <HI>Serchio,</HI> passing by strong lit∣tle
Town on our left hand called <HI>Rubiera,</HI> and after
8 miles more entred <HI>Reggio.</HI> a city almost as big as
<HI>Modena,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reggio</NOTE> and of equal strength, subject to the same
Prince, who is called Duke of <HI>Modena,</HI> and <HI>Reggio.</HI>
It is more extended in length, and makes a fairer
shew, having one broad and long street. Heer there
are many Sculptors who make pretty carved works
in Ivory, and wood, for which this Town is noted.
Ten miles onward we passed a long Bridge over the
River <HI>Lenzo,</HI> and entred the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI>'s Coun∣trey;
and five miles more brought us to <HI>Parma,</HI> a
<PB N="238" REF="132"/>
larger City then <HI>Modena,</HI> of a round figure, well
built of brick, though the houses be not tall. The
streets broad and well paved, but no <HI>porticos</HI> under
the houses. In short, it is a very pleasant and hand∣some
Town, but not so well fortified as many other
Cities in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>We travelled to <HI>Piacenza.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 26.</NOTE> At 6 miles distance from
<HI>Parma</HI> we ferried over the River <HI>Taro.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Piacenza</NOTE> Nine miles
further we came to a large <HI>Burgo</HI> called St. <HI>Donin.</HI>
Eight miles beyond St. <HI>Donin</HI> we passed through a
pretty little Town called <HI>Fiorenzuola,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fioren∣zuola.</NOTE> and just with∣out
the Town crossed the River <HI>Arta;</HI> and proceed∣ing
on still 12 miles, we came to <HI>Piacenza,</HI> a City
for bigness not inferiour to <HI>Parma,</HI> and for strength
Superior (being well walled and trench's about, and
having a strong Citadel) but not so handsome and
well built. The Revenues of the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> are
said by some to be 500000, by some but 400000
crowns <HI>per ann.</HI> He keeps 3000 foot, and 1000
horse in costant pay; and can upon occasion raise
20000 foot, and 1000 horse more. Besides <HI>Parma</HI>
and <HI>Piacenza</HI> he holds in the State of the Church the
Dukedom of <HI>Castro</HI> and the County of <HI>Ronciglione,</HI>
the first of which was pawned to the <HI>Pope,</HI> and for
want of payment of the money forfeited to the
Church, concerning the restitution whereof there hath
been such a stir of late, He holds also five Cities in
<HI>Abruzzo.</HI> The present Dukes name is <HI>Ranutius Far∣nesius.</HI></P>
<P>We rode to <HI>Crema,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE> 13 miles foom <HI>Piacenza,</HI> pas∣sing
through <HI>Castigno,</HI> a large Burgo in the State of
<HI>Milan,</HI> two miles thence ferrying over the River
<HI>Adda,</HI> and 2 miles further the River <HI>Serio,</HI> which
runs into the <HI>Adda.</HI> Heer we entred the <HI>Venetian</HI>
Territory, and at the end of other five miles arrived
at <HI>Crema,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crema.</NOTE> no great City, but strongly fenced and
fortified, and for the bigness populous; held with a
good Garrison of about 500 Souldiers by the <HI>Vene∣tians,</HI>

as being a frontier place. It is situate in a fair
and spacious plain, near the River <HI>Serio,</HI> and hath a
large territory about it, called <HI>Cremasco.</HI> This City
is famous for fine thread made by the Nuns, and lit∣tle
brushes made of the roots of a king of grass called
<HI>Capriole,</HI> which I take to be <HI>Gramen Scoparium is∣chaemi
paniculis</HI> of <HI>Lobel.</HI></P>
<P>We hired horses for <HI>Brescia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE> 30 miles distant from
<HI>Crema.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brescia</NOTE> By the way we rode through 1. a little Town
called <HI>Osanengo,</HI> about 3 miles from <HI>Crema.</HI> 2. <HI>Ro∣manengo</HI>
a great Burgo with a small Castle, belong∣ing
to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> some 3 miles from <HI>Osan∣engo:</HI>
and about 4 miles further onward 3. <HI>Soncin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Soncin.</NOTE> a
considerable wall'd Town in the Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI>
which <HI>Schottus</HI> takes notice of as a very civil place to
strangers, and mentions <HI>panem ex Amygdalis dulci∣bus
&amp; lucernas praestantissimas ex orichalco</HI> made there.
Near this Town we ferried over the River <HI>Oy</HI> or
<HI>Ollius,</HI> and entred again into the <HI>Venetian</HI> Territory.
Two miles off this place we rode close by <HI>L'orzi nuo∣vi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">L'orzi nuovi.</NOTE>
a small Town, but one of the best fortified places we
have seen, carefully guarded by a good Garrison
which the Venetians maintain there. Two miles
from this Fortress we passed a great Village called
<HI>L'orzi vecchii,</HI> then several Villages the most consi∣derable
whereof was <HI>Lo grado.</HI> Heerabout and at
<HI>L'orzi nuovi,</HI> is great store of flax planted, and fine
linnen cloth made. The Countrey we rode through
this day was full of Villages and well peopled, divi∣ded
into small Fields, and those enclosed with hed∣ges
like our enclosed Countreys in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Brescia</HI> is less then <HI>Verona,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brescia.</NOTE> but consi∣dering
the bigness more populous, well built, having
broad and streight streets, paved with stone in the
middle, and with bricks set edge wayes on each side,
after the manner of the <HI>Holland</HI> Cities; as are also
the streets of <HI>Parma, Piacenza,</HI> and <HI>Crema.</HI> It is en∣compassed
with two walls, the interiour of old
<PB N="240" REF="133"/>
building more slight and weak, the exterior of good
strength, and thickness, with a broad trench before
it. The inhabitants are very busie and industrious,
driving a great trade of making Guns and other iron
ware. The <HI>Brescian</HI> Guns are much esteemed not on∣ly
in <HI>Italy,</HI> but all over <HI>Europe,</HI> as well for the good∣ness
of the iron and temper, as the excellency and
neatness of the workmanship. The Markets are well
stored with all things necessary for humane life. The
territory of this City is in length from <HI>Moso</HI> near
<HI>Mantua</HI> to <HI>Dialengo</HI> in the upper end of <HI>Val Camonica</HI>
100 miles, in breadth from <HI>Limone</HI> upon the <HI>Lago
di Garda</HI> to <HI>L'orzi nuovi</HI> 50; fruitful of corn and
wine. The hills clothed with Woods, and the val∣leys
abundant in good pastures; so that there is ex∣cellent
cheese made heer, and sent abroad to <HI>Venice</HI>
and other parts of <HI>Italy.</HI> In the Mountains are iron
and copper mines, which yield great profit to the
owners, and inrich the whole Coutrey. Few Ci∣ties
in <HI>Italy</HI> have so large and so rich a territory, so
populous and full of Towns and great Villages. The
City it self hath often changed Lords and Govern∣ments,
and was for a long time miserably torn in
pieces, and wasted by intestine quarrels and fightings
between the Factions of the <HI>Guelfs</HI> and <HI>Ghibellines.</HI>
The <HI>Visconti</HI> of <HI>Milan</HI> made themselves masters of
it and held it for many years. In the time of <HI>Phil∣lippus
Maria,</HI> the Citizens being much oppressed and
aggrieved, and having often in vain sent Embssa∣dors
to him for redress, they finally delivered them∣selves
up to the <HI>Venetians</HI> in the year 1426. who now
keep in Garrison for the security of this City 800
Souldiers, and 300 more in the Castle, which stands
on a rocky hill and commands the whole Town.
On the sides of this hill we found Serpent Stones or
<HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> besides other petrified shells.</P>
<P>We travelled to <HI>Bergamo</HI> passing through 1. <HI>Hos∣pitaletta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">March 2.</NOTE>
a Village 7 miles distant from <HI>Brescia</HI> 2. <HI>Co∣kai,</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="133"/>
a large Village 5 miles further.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palaz∣zuolo.</NOTE> 3. <HI>Palazzulolo</HI> a
great Village standing on a steep bank on each side
the River <HI>Ollio</HI> We had a full view of the Alps all
along as we rode.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bergamo.</NOTE> <HI>Bergamo</HI> is seated upon the side
of a hill, and is a City of good account for greatness
and strength, encompassed about with high strong
walls, and a broad dry ditch or trench. The streets
are narrow, but the houses fair. Upon the top of
the hill above the City stands the Castle, which
though it be but a small place is strongly situate, and
commands the Town. They told us that there was a
Vault under ground from the Castle to the Palace of
the <HI>Capitaneo.</HI> Without the Walls of the City are
five large <HI>Borgo</HI>'s or Suburbs. 1. That of St. <HI>Leonardo</HI>
below the hill, which hath fair streets, and is inha∣bited
by rich Merchants. 2. That of St. <HI>Antonio.</HI>
3. Of <HI>Sancta Catharina.</HI> 4. S. <HI>Thomaso</HI> or <HI>Borsa di
pignole.</HI>
These three stand at some little distance one
from another, and some of them are walled about.
5. <HI>Borgo Canale</HI> or <HI>di S. Gotardo.</HI> This City seemed
to us a busie and thriving place. In the Church of
the <HI>Augustines</HI> Cloyster lies buried <HI>Ambrosius Cale∣pinus,</HI>

<P>This City hath undergone almost the same chan∣ges
of Lords and Government with <HI>Brescia,</HI> and did
<PB N="242" REF="134"/>
likewise voluntarily deliver it self up to the <HI>Venetians</HI>
in the year 1428. under whose Government it con∣tinued
till the year 1509, when the <HI>Venetian</HI> Army
was routed, broken and utterly defeated by <HI>Lewis</HI>
XII King of <HI>France,</HI> in the <HI>Ghiara</HI> of the River <HI>Adda,</HI>
and then it submitted to him and remained at his
Devotion so long as he held the Dutchy of <HI>Milan.</HI>
In the Year 1512, the <HI>French</HI> being expelled <HI>Italy,</HI>
it became subject to <HI>Maximilian Sforza</HI> Duke of <HI>Mi∣lan.</HI>
By reason of some grievances it revolted from
him and returned under the <HI>Venetians;</HI> but being
besieged by <HI>Raimundus Cardona</HI> a Spaniard, Vice-roy
of <HI>Naples,</HI> and Captain of the League, with a
great army, it was forced to surrender to the will
of <HI>Maximilian,</HI> and to avoid pillaging to pay 40000
Ducats of Gold, whereas before it would not pay
10000, <HI>Anno</HI> 1514. In fine, <HI>Anno</HI> 1516, it again
returned under the Government of the <HI>Venetians,</HI>

<HEAD>OF
MILAN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MILAN</HI> is one of the four principal Cities
of <HI>Italy;</HI> the other three being <HI>Rome, Venice</HI>
and <HI>Naples.</HI> It is called <HI>la grande,</HI> and well may it
be so, being ten <HI>Italian</HI> miles in circuit: and yet
(which is more) the figure of it approaches to a cir∣cle.
It conteins 11 Collegiate Churches, 71 Parishes,
30 Covents of Freres, 8 of Regular Canons, and
36 of Nuns. The number of Inhabitants of all sorts
is said to be 300000, but I believe they who report
it speak by guess and at random. All provisions for
the belly are very plentiful and cheap heer: so that
it is a proverbial saying, <HI>Solo in Milano si mangia,</HI>
They eat well only at <HI>Milan.</HI> The <HI>Domo</HI> or Cathe∣dral
Church is next to S. <HI>Peters</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> the greatest,
most sumptuous ad stately pile of building in <HI>Italy.</HI>
It is 250 cubits long, and 130 broad, according to
<HI>Schottus,</HI> and of an answerable highth. A more par∣ticular
description whereof may be seen in <HI>Schottus.</HI>
The great Hospital is the largest and most magnificent,
I think, in <HI>Europe,</HI> more like a stately Cloyster or
Princes Palace than an Hospital. There is one great
square Court, surrounded with a double <HI>portico,</HI> the
one below, the other obove flairs; besides four or
five other smaller Courts. The Revenues of this
house amount to more then 50000 crowns yearly;
and there are maintained in it about 4000 poor, in∣firm
and sick persons. In this City are many fair
and large Monasteries, and a great number of
Churches [of all sorts 238] beautified with exqui∣site
pictures and statues of the best Masters, and fur∣nished
with rich Altar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pieces, Reliques, Vests, and
<PB N="244" REF="135"/>
other Ornaments: The particulars may be seen in
<HI>Schottus</HI> and others. The Library called <HI>Bibliotheca
Ambrosiana</HI> is a handsom building furnished with
store of Good Books, and free for all persons, as
well strangers as Citizens, to enter into and make
use of. It was founded by Cardinal <HI>Carolus Borro∣mens,</HI>
of whom they have made a Saint. The Col∣lege
called <HI>Hermathenaeum</HI> is a stately building, ha∣ving
a handsome Court, encompassed with a double
<HI>Portico</HI> or Cloyster, one above the other. The pillars
of both <HI>Porticoes</HI> are double, the lowermost of the
<HI>Ionic,</HI> the upper of the <HI>Tuscan</HI> Order.</P>
<P>The Castle of <HI>Milan</HI> is esteemed one of the prin∣cipal
Fortresses of <HI>Europe,</HI> as well for its strength
(having never been taken by force) as for its great∣ness
and beauty. This Castle since its first building
hath been twice enlarged; for the ancient Castle,
built by the <HI>Visconti</HI>(which is now the Palace of the
Governour, and before which is Court having a
round stone-tower at each corner;) the <HI>French</HI> taking
in a great space of ground, enclosed with a square
wall of a very great highth and thickness, and a deep
ditch. Upon the top of this wall one may walk un∣der
cover round about, and from thence have a fair
prospect of the Countrey, and the new Fortificati∣ons
of the Castle, or the new line added by the <HI>Spa∣niard,</HI>
being of a pentagonal figure, and having at
each angle a Bastion or Mount, and between every
two Bastions an half Moon. It is well furnished
round about with great Guns ready mounted. With∣in
the Castle is a water-mill, which they told us was
driven by water which springs up within the Ca∣stle-walls.
<HI>Schottus</HI> saith that the circuit of the whole
Fortress besides the trenches is 1600 paces. The Gar∣rison
at our being there consisted of about 600 Soul∣diers,
and the <HI>Castellana</HI> or Governours name was
<HI>Don Balthasar Markadel.</HI></P>

with a multitude of Looking-glasses so disposed as
by mutual reflexion to multiply the object many
times, so that one could see no end of them: the
best in this king that I have any where seen. A plain
plate of glass with so many spherical protuberances
wrought upon it, that if you lookt through it up∣on
any object you saw it so many times multiplied as
there were protuberancies or segments of spheres
upon the plain of the glass. Likewise a <HI>Speculum</HI> of
the same fashion, by looking upon which through
the former you see your face so many times multipli∣ed
as to be equal to the product of the sum of the
protuberancies of the one glass multiplied into the
sum of the protuberancies of the other. Several
concave burning <HI>Specula</HI> of metal; and we saw the
experiment of burning by reflexion. Several En∣gines
counterfeiting a perpetual motion, of which
afterward we understood the intrigue. Several <HI>au∣tomata</HI>
and clocks of divers fashions, among the rest
two of a cylindrical figure which moved without
weight or spring, only by being placed upon an en∣clining
plain, their own weight was the spring of
their motion. Pieces of Amber with Flies, Grashop∣pers,
Bees enclosed in them. Pieces of Crystal with
Grass, Moss, Leaves, Insects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> enclosed in them.
A large piece of Crystal with a drop of water in it,
and in that water a bubble of air, which as you tur∣ned

Crystal, making drinking-glasses and other vessels,
cases for tweezers, seals, and an hundred pretty knacks
of it: they also engrave figures upon it. They grind
and polish it with a brass wheel, upon which they put
the powder of <HI>Smiris</HI> mingled with water; and af∣ter
to smooth it they use the power of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">i. e. Dead stone.</NOTE> <HI>Sasse-mort,</HI>
which is a stone they find in the River fast by. This
stone by lying in the water by degrees dies, from a
heavy pebble first becoming light like a pumice, and
afterward if it lie longer in the water crumbling to
dust. Most ordinary stones by lying in this water,
or where the water sometimes comes, will (as they
told us) die in this manner, excepting the clear pel∣lucid

the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> usually keeps his Court there,
frequent and populous. The ancient buildings are
not better than those of our <HI>English</HI> Towns: but
there is one long street of new buildings tall and
uniform; and about the midst of it a large square
Piazza, having on each side a fair Cloyster, very
handsome and sightly. At one end of this street is
another Piazza before the Dukes Palace, a fair build∣ing
but not yet finished. Heer is a Citadel with 5
bastions serving as well to bridle as defend the Town.
Heer we met with some of the Protestants of the
Valleys of <HI>Lucern</HI> and <HI>Angrona,</HI> who told us that by
the intercession of the Cantons of <HI>Zurich</HI> and <HI>Bern,</HI>
the <HI>Duke</HI> hath at present made an accord with them,
permitting them still to enjoy the liberty of their Re∣ligion.
<PB N="248" REF="137"/>
They dwel in 14 <HI>pagi</HI> or Villages, have no
Town, are in number about 15000 souls, and of
them about 2000 fighting men. These are divided
into 14 Companies under so many Captains, among
whom <HI>Jean Janneville</HI> is noted for a valiant man
and a good Souldier. The Papists call these men
<HI>Barbetti</HI> and <HI>Genevrini.</HI> They are the only Prote∣stants
in <HI>Italy,</HI> and have maintained the purity of
their Religion all along these 1200 years. They run
over the mountains like <HI>chamois,</HI> never shooting (if
themselves may be believed) but they hit. They
boasted to us that in the late War they had not lost
above 40 or 50 men, and had killed 500 of the
<HI>Dukes;</HI> nevertheless the <HI>Duke</HI> hath built a strong for∣tress
at a place called <HI>La torre</HI> in the middle of them.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Turin</HI> hath an University, and boasts
to have been the first that brought the use of Print∣ing
into <HI>Italy.</HI> All provisions are plentiful and cheap
there, the Countrey round about being very rich
and fertile. Indeed the whole Principality of <HI>Piemont</HI>
is esteemed inferiour to no part of <HI>Italy</HI> for pleasant∣ness,
and plenty of Corn, Cattel, Wine, Fruit, Hemp,
Flax, Metals, and almost every thing necessary for
humane life: and withal it is so populous, that the
<HI>Italians</HI> use to say, that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> hath only
one City in <HI>Italy</HI> of 300 miles in compass. It hath 8
Episcopal Cities and 150 Towns. The Inhabitants are
more given to Husbandry than Merchandise, so that
the land is no where better cultivated then in <HI>Pie∣mont.</HI>
They are also very affectionate to their Prince,
and for his honour and safety ready upon all occa∣sions
to venture their lives and fortunes. <HI>Leti</HI> saith
that they are good Souldiers, expert in warlike ex∣ercises,
and so valiant that they will rather die than
turn their backs. Of the riches of this Countrey we
may (saith he) take an estimate by the late Wars
which continued for 23 years, during which time
were maintained by the Duke in Garrison, and in
<PB N="249" REF="137"/>
the field between 25 and 30 thousand Souldiers, for
the most part without any assistance or supplies of
money or men from any other place but <HI>Piemont;</HI>
which besides all this contributed to the <HI>Duke</HI> in 15
years 11 millions. The same Author saith, it is not
in <HI>Piemont</HI> as in other Countreys, wherein there are
some persons excessive rich, but the generality of the
people extremely poor: but on the contrary the
<HI>Piemontese</HI> are generally well to live, and there are
very few among them of extraordinary estates.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Duke</HI> he by all mens confession keeps a
splendid and regal Court, answerable to his Title
of Royal Highness. His annual Revenue is said to
be a million of gold: according to <HI>Leti</HI> 1800000
crowns; of which <HI>Piemont</HI> alone yields 1400000.
He is able to bring into the Field 30000 Foot, and
5000 Horse, and yet leave enough at home to guard
the Countrey. The States which the <HI>Duke</HI> possesses
in <HI>Italy</HI> are, The Principality of <HI>Piemont,</HI> The Mar∣quesates
of <HI>Saluzzes</HI>(which he had of the <HI>French</HI> in
exchange for <HI>la Bresse</HI>) and of <HI>Asti;</HI> the Duchy of
<HI>Aosta;</HI> the Countries or Earldoms of <HI>Nizza,</HI> and of
<HI>Vercelli.</HI></P>
<P>The present Dukes name is <HI>Carolus Emmanuel,</HI> son
of <HI>Victor Amideus:</HI> he was at the time of our being
there about thirty years of age; and was then in
mourning for his Duchess <HI>Francesca Borbona,</HI> and
his Mother <HI>Christiana di Francia</HI> whom they call

We took horses and a guide at <HI>Turin</HI> for <HI>Genua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 17.</NOTE>
which we reacht at three days end. About a mile

to be navigable) by a Bridge, and after we had rode
about a mile further, by the Rivers side, we moun∣ted
the hills under which the River heerabout runs,
which are very steep and difficult to ascend. Not far
from the foot of these Mountains, in the Woods
wherewith they are covered, and in the ditches by
the way side, I observed growing wild,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>i. e.</HI> Dogs tooth Violet; common Bulbous Violet; the great∣er Tooth∣wort; common Leopards bane; the lesser Grape-Hya∣cinth, and Hepatica or No∣ble Li∣verwort. Chier.</NOTE> <HI>Dens cani∣nus

pretty large Town called <HI>Chier,</HI> where we took no∣tice
of a triumphant Arch erected to <HI>Victor Amadeus</HI>
Father to the present Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> About 4
miles further we passed by a walled Town called
<HI>Villa nova;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aste.</NOTE> and this first night lodged at <HI>Aste,</HI> a large
Town, but that seemed to us to be poor and decay∣ing,
20 miles distant from <HI>Turin.</HI></P>
<P>We proceeded on our journey as far as <HI>Nove,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE> a
pretty large Town under the <HI>Genoese,</HI> 27 <HI>Piemont</HI>
miles distant from <HI>Aste;</HI> I think they may well pass
for 35 <HI>English.</HI> About 4 miles from <HI>Aste</HI> upon the
bank of the River <HI>Tanar</HI> (which is there very high)
and on the sands under the bank we found great va∣riety
of petrified shells, as <HI>Oysters, Scallops, Cochles,</HI>
&amp;c. as also <HI>tubuli striati,</HI> call'd by some <HI>Antales,</HI>
which Seignior <HI>Rosaccio</HI> a Mountebank in <HI>Venice</HI> first

flower. This day we passed by a large Village called
<HI>Non,</HI> and another which had formerly been walled,
called <HI>Felizan:</HI> then <HI>Alexandria,</HI> an large Town upon
the River <HI>Tanar,</HI> of more strength than beauty; the
buildings both public and private being generally
but mean. It was so called in honour of Pope <HI>Alex∣ander</HI>
III; because in his time it was peopled by the
<HI>Milanese,</HI> whose City was then almost quite destroy∣ed
ad made desolate by the Emperour <HI>Frederic Bar∣barossa,</HI>
for siding with the Pope against him. The
River (which seemed to me as large as the <HI>Po</HI> at <HI>Tu∣rin</HI>)
divides the City in two parts, which are joyned
together by a fair brick-bridge. In our passage
through the Town we took notice of a triumphal
Arch erected to <HI>Philip</HI> IV. King of <HI>Spain</HI> upon his
marriage.</P>
<P>We rode from <HI>Nove</HI> to <HI>Genna</HI> 30 miles all over
mountains.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE> About 6 miles from <HI>Nove</HI> we passed
through a handsom little walled Town, called <HI>Gavi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gavi.</NOTE>
where there is a strong castle on a hill over the
Town; and about 6 miles further onward, another
elegant and well-built Town called <HI>Voltagio.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Voltagio.</NOTE> From
hence we ascended continually for about 7 or 8 miles
till we came to the top of a very high hill, from
whence we had a prospect of <HI>Genua</HI> and the Sea.
Then we descended constantly till we came to the
City. In all this way we met with and overtook
Mules and Asses going to and returning from <HI>Genua,</HI>
to the number of 500 or 600 or more. Between
<HI>Gavi</HI> and <HI>Voltagio</HI> we observed <HI>Dens caninus</HI> with a

<HI>Genoa.</HI> It is a stately plant, the tallest of this kind,
arising to the stature and bigness of broom heer∣about;
near <HI>Monpellier</HI> it is less.</P>
<P>We viewed <HI>Genua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 20. Genua.</NOTE> which for the building of it is
certainly the most stately and, according to its Epi∣thete,
superb City in all <HI>Italy.</HI> The houses are gene∣rally
tall, scarce a mean house to be seen in Town.
The <HI>New-street</HI> answers the fame that goeth of it. It
is but short, consisting only of 8 or 10 Palaces, built
of marble, very sumptuous and magnific, the mean∣est
of them) as <HI>Cluverius</HI> saith) being able to receive
and lodge the greatest Prince and his Retinue. The
only deformity of this City is the narrowness of
the streets unanswerable to the tallness of the houses;
and yet they are made so on purpose, partly to save
ground, which heer is precious; and partly to keep
off the scorching beams of the Sun in Summer time,
for the conveniency of walking cool; for which
reason I have observed many of the ancient Towns
of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Gallia Narbonensis</HI> to have their streets
made very narrow. This City lies under the moun∣tains
exposed to the South, so that it must needs be
very hot in Summer, as witness the Orange and
Olive trees which grow so plentifully heer, that they
can afford those fruits at easie rates, and drive there∣with
a great trade, furnishing with Oranges <HI>Florence</HI>
and a good part of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> and sometimes send∣ing
them into <HI>England.</HI> It is built in form of a Thea∣ter,
or Crescent, encompassed with a double wall
toward the land. The exterior or new wall of a
great highth and thickness passes over the top of
mountains, and takes in a great deal of void
ground.</P>
<P>The famous new mole, which now makes this a
secure Harbour, is said to have cost as much as the
new wall: for a work of that nature I believe it is
not to be parallel'd in the whole world. The man∣ners
of the Inhabitants are not answerable to the
<PB N="253" REF="139"/>
beauty of their houses; they being noted among
their own Countrey-men the <HI>Italians</HI> for proud, un∣faithful,
revengeful, uncivil to Strangers, and horri∣bly
exacting. There goeth a proverbial saying of
<HI>Genoa,</HI> that it hath, <HI>montagne senza alberi, mare senza
pesce, huomini senza fede &amp; donne senza vergogna,</HI> that
is, <HI>Mountains without trees, a Sea without fish,
Men without faith, and Women without shame.</HI>
The number of the Inhabitants must needs be
great, they having lost in the last great Plague (as
we were credibly informed) to the number of
80000 souls. The chief Trade of the Town is Silks
and Velvets; they make also prety turned works of
Coral.</P>
<P>The Government of it according to the new
laws made by the Popes Legate, and the Emperors
and King of <HI>Spains</HI> Embassadors, not long after the
time of <HI>Andreas Doria,</HI> is on this wise. There is
1. a <HI>Duke,</HI> who continues in office 2 years. 2. Two
<HI>Collegia;</HI> one of <HI>Governatori</HI>(as they term them) the
other of <HI>Procuratori.</HI> The <HI>Governatori</HI> 12, the <HI>Pro∣curatori</HI>
8, all elected, besides those that of course
come in for their lives. 3. A greater <HI>Council</HI> of 400.
4. A lesser <HI>Council</HI> of 100. 5. A <HI>Seminary</HI> for the
2 <HI>Collegia</HI> of 120. The 2 <HI>Collegia</HI> of <HI>Governatori</HI> and
<HI>Procuratori,</HI> are as it were the chief Senate or Privy
Council or House of Lords; and are chosen twice a
year, <HI>viz.</HI> about the middle of <HI>June</HI> and about the
middle of <HI>December,</HI> after this manner. All the <HI>Se∣minarium</HI>
of 120 have their names together with
their surnames and fathers names written in little
scrolls of parchment, an put into an iron box,
which is kept very securely under many locks. When
the time of election comes this box is brought forth
before the Duke, the 2 <HI>Collegia,</HI> and the lesser Coun∣cil.
Then a boy, who must be under ten years of
age, puts his hand into the box, and draws out 5
scrolls, which are read, and the 3 first, if they be
<PB N="254" REF="140"/>
capable, are <HI>Governatori,</HI> the 2 last <HI>Procuratori.</HI> If a
man be 100 miles off the City he is uncapable of be∣ing
elected for that time. Likewise two of the same
family cannot be <HI>Procuratori</HI> or <HI>Governatori</HI> together.
Therefore if the two first that are drawn out or the
two second be of the same family, the first is <HI>Governa∣tor,</HI>
and the second <HI>Procurator:</HI> if the two last be of the
same family, the first drawn out is a <HI>Procurator,</HI> and
the second is returned into the box again, and the
boy draws out another. So that every six months five
are chosen into the <HI>Collegia,</HI> and five go out, and eve∣ry
one stays in office two years. In the <HI>Collegium
Procuratorum,</HI> besides the 8, are all those who have
been <HI>Dukes,</HI> and are gone out of office, who (<HI>modò benè
se gesserint</HI>) continue <HI>Procuratori</HI> during their
lives.</P>
<P>To supply or make up the <HI>Seminarium</HI> 120, every
year in the stead of those who are dead, made unca∣pable,
or chosen into the 2 <HI>Collegia,</HI> the lesser Coun∣cil
chuses a double number, all which must have 3
suffrages of 5. And out of these the greater Council
chuse half by the major vote.</P>
<P>For chusing the <HI>Councils</HI> both <HI>greater</HI> and <HI>lesser,</HI> the
<HI>lesser Council</HI> in presence of the Duke and 2 <HI>Collegia</HI>
chuse 30 <HI>Electors,</HI>(all which must be of the Nobili∣ty)
by 3 suffrages of 5. These 30 chuse both the
<HI>greater</HI> and <HI>lesser Council,</HI> but the <HI>lesser</HI> out of the
number of the <HI>greater,</HI> by a like proportion of suf∣frages.
The <HI>greater Council</HI> is assembled upon im∣portant
occasions, and with the <HI>Duke</HI> and 2 <HI>Collegia</HI>
makes the supreme power: The <HI>lesser Council</HI> takes
care of the lesser and ordinary concerns of the City
and Common-wealth. Those who are capable of be∣ing
chosen into the <HI>greater Council</HI> must be 25 years
of age; only the 30 Electors may, if they please or
see it expedient, chuse to the number of 60 who
are but 22 years old. Of the <HI>lesser Council</HI> the one
half must be 30 years of age, the others at least 27,
<PB N="255" REF="140"/>
excepting Doctors of Law and Physic, who if they
be well qualified may be chosen two years younger.
Those who are capable of being chosen into the <HI>Se∣minarium</HI>
must be 40 years of age.</P>
<P>The choice of the Duke is in this manner. The
<HI>great Council</HI> being assembled there are put into an
Urn 10 golden balls marked with 10 several letters.</P>
<P>One of these being drawn out is shewn to the
Conservators of the Laws, who thereupon put
into another Urn standing by the Dukes throne 50
golden balls marked with the same letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This is done to prevent fraud, for if the gol∣den balls were ei∣ther not marked at all, or with any sign or letter known before∣hand, any one of the Coun∣cil might bring such a ball with him, and taking it in his hand make shew as if he drew it out of the Urn.</NOTE>, and 50
silver balls. These being shaken together, the <HI>lesser
Council</HI> of 100, excluding the 2 <HI>Collegia,</HI> draw out
each man a ball. He that draws out a golden ball
shews it to the <HI>Censors,</HI> who sit by, and presently
writes in a scroll of paper the name of him whom
he thinks fit to nominate for Duke and goes out of
the Council. When all the golden balls are drawn
out, the two <HI>Collegia</HI> bring them into order, and
count them over, and if the number of the nomi∣nated
amount to 20 then they are propounded to the
<HI>greater Council,</HI> who out of them by major vote
chuse 15. Out of these 15 the <HI>lesser Council</HI> chuse 6
by 3 suffrages of 5. Out of these 6 again by major
vote the <HI>greater Council</HI> chuse the Duke. These suf∣frages
are all occult, that is, given by putting of balls
into balloting boxes. If in the <HI>greater Council</HI> for any
person the negative and affirmative suffrages are
equal, then 5 by lot are to be put out of the Council,
and the rest to ballot again. Many other provisions
there are in case of equality or disagreement, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Nothing can be propounded in <HI>Council</HI> but by the
Duke, who during the time of his regency lives in
the Palace, and hath (according to <HI>Sansovinus</HI>) a
guard of 500 <HI>Suitzers.</HI></P>
<P>The Office of S. <HI>George</HI> is (as far as I understand
it) nothing but a company of Bankers, which lend
money to the Common-wealth, for which they are
<PB N="256" REF="141"/>
allowed so much <HI>per cent.</HI> and have assigned to them
the publick gabells and other revenues, and for their
further security have also the Island of <HI>Corsica</HI> enga∣ged
to them. This company chuse yearly out of their
own number 8 protectors, who are to take care of
and manage the affairs of all the Creditors. Into this
bank strangers usually put in money and so become of
the Company, for which they receive yearly interest,
proportionable to the improvement made of the
whole stock of moneys then in bank.</P>
<P>The public Revenue of this State is said by some
to be 120000 crowns <HI>per annum,</HI> and yet scarce suf∣ficient
to defray the public expences.</P>
<P>There are many private Citizens heer very rich.
The Republic is thought to be able to raise an Army,
of 30000 men, and to set out to Sea 12 Gallies and
20 Ships of War. They hold good correspondence
with all Christian Princes and States excepting the
Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> by reason of his pretence to the City
of <HI>Savona.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Luca</HI> is no great City, <HI>Sansovinus</HI> saith 2 miles
round, (but I take it to be three or more) yet is it
very populous, containing within its walls in <HI>San∣sovinus</HI>
his time about 34000 persons; which num∣ber
I believe is now much encreased by reason of the
freedom and ease the subjects enjoy under this Go∣vernment
above their neighbours of <HI>Tuscany.</HI> It is
situate in a pleasant Valley, well fortified, the walls
and bulwarks both very strong and in good repair;
the mounts and platforms stored with great Guns;
several half Moons of earth without the walls: The
walls themselves planted with rows of trees, and
we permitted to walk them without scruple or que∣stion.
The buildings of the City good; the Churches
though not great, yet as well kept and handsomely
adorned within side as a man shall see any: The
streets cleanly and well paved; in a word all things
both within and without the City very trim and po∣lite.
Both Citizens and Countreymen are very cour∣teous
and well manner'd, and seem both by their
<PB N="259" REF="142"/>
habit and address, and the chearfulness of their
looks, to live more freely and in better condition,
and to have more spirit and courage then the other
people of <HI>Italy.</HI> That they live more freely and in
better circumstances then their neighbours, them∣selves
are sensible, and thereupon so well affected to
their Governours, and studious to maintain their
liberty, that upon giving them a token by making a
fire upon one of the towers all the Countreymen run
presently to the City, so that in 2 or 3 hours time
they can have ready 30000 men in Arms: And
withal they are so couragious and stout, that they
seem to have no fear at all of the Duke of <HI>Tuscany</HI>
their potent neighbour, but told us, that if their Go∣vernours
would lead them, they would not fear to
march up to the very Gates of <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>That liberty doth naturally beget courage and va∣lour,
and on the contrary slavery and oppression
break and debase mens spirits, is so clear in experi∣ence,
that I need not go about to prove it. And yet
were it not so, it is no wonder that men who find
themselves well at ease, and have something to lose
or are at least in a capacity of growing rich if not al∣ready
so, should be very loth to change their condi∣tion
for a worse, and stoutly defend themselves a∣gainst
any that should endeavour to bring them un∣der
the yoke; whereas those that are oppressed and
aggrieved having nothing to lose, and being already
in as bad a condition as they are like to be under any
other Government, must needs have little heart to
fight for their Princes, and be indifferent which way
things go.</P>
<P>The women are not so strictly guarded and confi∣ned
as in other Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> but walk up and
down more freely. They are many of them hand∣some
and well-favoured, and notwithstanding their
liberty I think more modest then their neighbours:
in their habit and attire they imitate somewhat the
French fashions.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="143"/>
This City is very vigilant and careful to preserve
its liberty: Though they have 3 Gates they permit
strangers to enter in and go out only at one, that so
they may more easily know what number are in the
City, for fear of a surprise. They permit none to
walk about the streets so much as with a Sword, un∣less
he have license from the <HI>Antiani.</HI></P>
<P>The Government is by a great Council of 160 an∣nually
chosen out of the Nobility, (the commons ha∣ving
no interest or share therein) who must be all at
least 25 years old, nine <HI>Antiani</HI> and a <HI>Gonfaloniere.</HI>
The <HI>Antiani</HI> and <HI>Gonfaloniere</HI> are chosen anew every
two months. These are called the <HI>Signoria,</HI> and must
live in the Palace during the time of their office and
authority. They have a guard of Switzers in the Pa∣lace
of about 80. The <HI>Gonfaloniere</HI> is the supreme of∣ficer,
yet hath little advantage above the rest more
then his title and precedency; and we were told
that during his office he is exempted from all taxes
and gabels, which the Noblemen pay equally with
the Commons. The City is divided into 3 parts cal∣led
<HI>Terzieri,</HI> each <HI>Terziero</HI> hath its Arms or Banner
called <HI>Gonfalone;</HI> whence the name <HI>Gonfaloniere.</HI> At
the corners of each street are painted both the Arms
and name of the <HI>Terziero,</HI> and the Bulwark they are
to defend. Out of each <HI>Terziero</HI> are chosen by the
Council three <HI>Antiani.</HI></P>
<P>The public revenue is thought to be 100000
crowns <HI>per ann.</HI> The Olives that grow in this terri∣tory

<HEAD>OF
PISA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PISA</HI> was formerly, so long as it continued a
Free-state or Common-wealth, a rich, popu∣lous,
potent and flourishing City; but since it hath
come under the <HI>Florentine</HI> yoke it is become poor,
weak, and almost desolate, notwithstanding all the
endeavours the <HI>Dukes</HI> of <HI>Tuscany</HI> have used to in∣vite
and draw people thither, by founding an Uni∣versity,
setting up an order of Knighthood, and
building an Exchange for Merchants there. It is situ∣ate
upon the River <HI>Arnus</HI> in a fenny level; so that the
air must needs be bad and unwholesome for such as
are not born there. The most remarkable things we
took notice of in this City were 1. The Church of
the Knights of S. <HI>Stephen,</HI> an Order founded by
<HI>Cosmus</HI> the first great <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Tuscany.</HI> 2. The house

brought out of the holy Land. The earth is said to
consume a body in 48 hours: it is an oblong square,
encompassed with a broad Portico, paved with
Grave-stones, and the walls painted. 6. The <HI>Cam∣panile</HI>
or Steeple, a large round tower of a consider∣able
highth, so very much enclining or seeming to
encline or lean to one side, that one would think it
could not long stand upright, but must needs fall
that way. I suppose it was on purpose built so at first,
one side being made perpendicular and the other en∣clining,
to deceive the sight, though some say it

<P>From <HI>Pisa</HI> we went by boat to <HI>Ligorn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ligorn.</NOTE> <HI>[Livorno]</HI>
called anciently <HI>Portus Liburnus,</HI> some 10 or 12
miles distant. This Town is not large, and but low
built, yet very pleasant and uniform, having streight
streets, and a spacious <HI>Piazza</HI> in the middle. It
stands in an open level, without mountain or hillock
within 5 miles of it on any side. It is well-fortified
with walls and bastions, and a deep trench round
except on the Sea-side; and secured with a good
Garrison, being one of the most considerable and
important places in all <HI>Tuscany.</HI> Since the Great
<HI>Duke</HI> made it a free port it hath encreased mightily
in trading and riches, great numbers, of Merchants
from all Nations resorting hither, and most of the
bargains for the commodities of the whole <HI>Levant</HI>
being heer driven. The greatest part of the Inhabi∣tants
are Strangers and Jews, which last are esteem∣ed
one third of the whole number of people, and
thought to amount to 5000 persons and upward.
Before these privileges granted to <HI>Ligorn,</HI> when it
was thin of Inhabitants, it was accounted a very bad
air and an unhealthful place, by reason of the fens
and marshes adjoyning; but now since it is become
populous, the multitude of fires (as is supposed)
hath so corrected the air, that people enjoy their
health as well and live as long heer as in any other
Town or City of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>

<P>At <HI>Ligorn</HI> finding a good <HI>Dutch</HI> Vessel ready to set
sail for <HI>Naples,</HI> we put our selves aboard her: The
wind not favouring us we spent five days in this
passage before we reached our Port. The Captain of
the Ship told us that heerabouts usually in the fore∣noon
the wind blows from the Land, and in the af∣ternoon
from the Sea; so that it is Easterly in the
forenoon, and Westerly in the afternoon. We also
observed in this Voyage, that about Sun-set the wind
fell; so that soon after Sun-set there was little or no
wind stirring: and likewise several days about Sun-rising
we had but little wind. In our return back∣wards
from <HI>Messina</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> and from <HI>Naples</HI> to
<HI>Ligorn,</HI> we observed that the wind for the most part
sate contrary to us. And the Sea men told us that
<PB N="266" REF="146" MS="y"/>
this was general in Summer time. So that you have
a much quicker passage from <HI>Ligorn</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> and
thence to <HI>Messina,</HI> than backwards. We observed al∣so
that the wind follows the Sun, so that every morn∣ing
we could make some use of the wind to sail
with, but in the afternoon none at all; which a∣grees
exactly with our Captains observation, the
land lying Eastward, and the Sea West. Our Cap∣tain
also told us that when they made a Voyage from
<HI>Holland</HI> to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> they sailed down the
Coast of <HI>Africa</HI> as far Southward, as the place in the
<HI>West-Indies</HI> whither they intended to go lay, and
then steer'd directly Westward; both the wind
blowing constantly from the East, and the Sea also
running the same way. Which relation of his con∣curring
with the general vogue of Mariners (if true)
doth much confirm the opinion of the diurnal moti∣on
of the earth. When they return backwards from
thence into <HI>Holland,</HI> they go round about the Bay of
<HI>Mexico,</HI> and up a good way northward, and then strike
over to <HI>Europe,</HI> the water being reflected (as he said)
that way, and the wind also often blowing that way.</P>
<P><HI>Naples</HI> lies by the Sea side under hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naples.</NOTE> in form of
a Theater; for its figure and situation much like to
<HI>Genua,</HI> but somewhat bigger, and much more po∣pulous;
so that before the last great Plague (which
swept away as we were credibly informed at least
120000 souls) one might well reckon the number of
Inhabitants to have been about three hundred thou∣sand.
The circuit of the walls is not above seven
<HI>Italian</HI> miles, but it hath large Suburbs. The Town
is well built of stone; the houses tall and massy;
for the most part flat rooft, and covered with a kind
of plaster, which fences out the rain, and endures
the weather well. Notwithstanding this City lies so
far South, and under hills, yet is not the heat ex∣treme,
but such as may well be endured even in the
middle of Summer, they having for the most part
<PB N="267" REF="146"/>
about noon-tide a brize of wind, which cools and
refreshes much. Two or three hot days we had, but
the rest temperate enough. They told us that there
uses to be very little rain there in Summer time, how∣beit
at our being there (which was in the latter end
of <HI>June</HI> and beginning of <HI>July</HI>) it rained every other
day, and sometimes so plentifully, that the water
ran down like a river in the streets. When they have
no rain, to cool the streets in the afternoon they
draw about a tun filled with cold water, and bored
with several holes, whence the water gushes out as
it goes along. The Dialect of the common people is
much different from the <HI>Tuscane,</HI> and not to be un∣derstood
but by one who hath a long time conversed
with them. This City is well served with all provi∣sions,
especially fruit which is very cheap heer. In
this place we took first notice of the <HI>Cucurbita an∣guina,
Cucumis anguinus, Mala insana, &amp; Limoncelle,</HI>
to be sold in market. <HI>Macarones</HI> and <HI>Vermicelle</HI> (which
are nothing but a kind of paste cut into the figure of
worms or thongs) boil'd in broth or water, are a
great dish heer as well as at <HI>Messina,</HI> and as much
esteemed by the vulgar, as Frumenty by the Coun∣trey
people in <HI>England.</HI> All the <HI>Neopolitans</HI> and <HI>Si∣cilians,</HI>
and genenrally the <HI>Italians</HI> drink their Wine
and water snowed; and you shall see many stalls in
the streets where there is snowed water to be sold:
many also you shall meet, with a barrel at their
backs and glasses in their hands, crying<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>i e.</HI> Snowed water or∣iced wa∣ter.</NOTE> <HI>Acqua ghi∣acciata,</HI>

that before the last great Plague the very gabel
upon snow was farmed at 25000 crowns <HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>NB.</HI> To cool the water or wine they do not put
the snow into it, but round about the vessel wherein
it is contained: so they have a vessel conteining the
snow or ice, and into that they set the vessel contein∣ing
the wine or water.</P>
<P>There are in this City an incredible number of
<PB N="268" REF="147"/>
Monasteries or Religious houses (as they call them.)
<HI>Beltrano Descript. Neap.</HI> gives us a Catalogue of 160
of all sorts, whereof 121 of men and 39 of wo∣men;
the number of the persons contained in them
being 1242.</P>
<P>Four Castles there are to secure and bridle the Ci∣ty
withal, 1. <HI>Castel d'Ovo,</HI> built on a rock in the
Sea, having an artificial Caussey or mole leading to
it from the shore. 2. <HI>Castel S. Elmo</HI> or S. <HI>Hermo</HI> stand∣ing
on a hill above the City. 3. <HI>Castel Novo</HI> by the
water side, near the Haven where the Gallies lie.
4. <HI>Torrione di Carmine,</HI> made use of by <HI>Massaniello</HI>
and <HI>Anese</HI> in the time of the Rebellion. This is on∣ly
a tower belonging to the <HI>Carmelites</HI> Cloyster.</P>
<P>The Churches in this Town are generally very
handsome within side; many of them richly gilt
and sumptuously adorned; some of them not only
paved with marble of divers colours, but their walls
encrusted all over with marble inlaid. Of all the
Cloysters I have any where seen that of the <HI>Carthusi∣ans,</HI>
close adjoyning to the Castle S. <HI>Elmo,</HI> is the
most splendid and magnific, where there is a large
square Court compassed about with the fairest <HI>peri∣stylium</HI>
or Cloyster that I ever saw: All the pillars and
all the pavement (of the Portico I mean) being of mar∣ble
of several colours well wrought, polish'd and laid,
and so cleanly and elegantly kept, that one cannot see
a more pleasant spectacle of this nature. For my own
part I was much taken with the sight of it. Heer is a
fair Arsenal to build Gallies in, now made but little
use of. The public Granary deserves notice taking,
it being the greatest and best furnished of any we
have seen. They told us there was Corn enough al∣ways
in store to serve the whole City some years up∣on
any exigency. There are great Vaults made under∣ground
to keep it in in Winter time, and large
rooms above to keep it in Summer. A great number
of men they hire to turn all the beds of Corn every
<PB N="269" REF="147"/>
day. The Bakers of the Town are obliged to take
every month 25000<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A to∣molo is a measure bigger then an English Bushel.</NOTE> <HI>tomoli</HI> out of this Granary,
that so there may be a succession of new Corn yearly.

<P>Every hearth (fires they call them) in this King∣dom
of <HI>Naples</HI> pays 15 Carolines the year to the
King, which is about six and six pence or seven shil∣lings
<HI>English.</HI> The number of fires in the whole
<PB N="271" REF="148"/>
Kingdom is 475727, besides 5804 which are exempt
from payment. In which number are not compre∣hended
the fires of the <HI>Albanese</HI> and <HI>Illyrians</HI> com∣monly
called <HI>Sclavonians</HI> who pay no more then
11 Carolines the year, are numbred every year, and
are permitted to remove from place to place in the
Kingdom. The number of these extraordinary fires
is 4451. So then the whole sum of the Hearth∣mony
is 719095 Ducats 4 Carolines, from which
deducting what is to be abated for places privileged
and exempt from payment, that which comes clear
into the Kings treasury will be 654873 Ducats, and
six Carolines.</P>
<P>The <HI>Adogo</HI> or tax which feudatories pay to the
King in lieu of personal service amounts in the whole
Kingdom to 120568 Ducats: They also pay Reliefs
after Deaths one half of a years Revenue. Besides
these there are abundance more taxes and gabels
paid by the Subject; an account of all which in par∣ticular
may be seen in <HI>Scipio Mazzella</HI> his Descripti∣on
of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> written in <HI>Italian</HI>
and printed 1601. So that one would think it were
impossible for poor Pesants to pick up so much money
as they pay to the King only: and yet I believe the
gabels and payments are since that time much encrea∣sed.
The wholesum of all the Kings <HI>Entrata</HI> or Re∣venue
yearly accruing from this Kingdom then was
2996937 Ducats, 3 Carolines and 14 grains.</P>
<P>While we staid in this City we were present at
the meeting of the <HI>Virtuosi</HI> or Philosophic Academy,
which is held weekly on Wednesdays in the Palace
of that most civil and obliging, noble and vertuous
person the Marquess <HI>D' Arena.</HI> There were of the
Academy but 15 or 16 admitted, but at the meeting
were present at least threescore. First there was shew∣ed
the experiment of the waters ascending above its
level in slender tubes, upon which when they had
discoursed a while, three of the Society recited dis∣courses
<PB N="272" REF="149" MS="y"/>
they had studied and composed about parti∣cular
subjects, which were appointed them to consi∣der
the week before: and after some objections
against what was delivered and reasonings to and
fro about it, the company was dismist. A man could
scarce hope to find such a knot of ingenious persons
and of that latitude and freedom of judgment in
so remote a part of <HI>Europe,</HI> and in the communion
of such a Church. They are well acquainted with
writings of all the learned and ingenious men of the
immediately preceding age, as <HI>Galileo, Cartes, Gas∣sendus,
Harvey, Verulam;</HI> and of the present yet sur∣viving,
as Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> Sir <HI>George Ent,</HI> Dr. <HI>Glisson,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Willis,</HI> Dr. <HI>Wharton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hobbs,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hook,</HI> Monsieur
<HI>Pecquet,</HI> &amp;c. We were very much pleased and satis∣fied
with the conversation and discourse of some of
them. Amongst the rest Dr. <HI>Thomas Cornelius</HI> hath
made himself known to the world by his Writings.</P>
<P>We went by water to <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> anciently <HI>Puteoli;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">April 24 Pozzuolo</NOTE>
there so soon as we were come into our Inn many
Sea-men and Countrey people came about us, some
bringing Shells, others <HI>Hippocampi</HI> dried, others an∣cient
medals and <HI>Entaglie,</HI> others pieces of coloured
glass raked out of the Sea, (as they told us) about
<HI>Argenteria.</HI> Near this Town are several arches of
stone [13 peers] reaching a great way into the Sea.
Some are of opinion that this was the beginning of
<HI>Caligula</HI>'s Bridge over this Bay, and that from the
end of this pile as far as <HI>Baiae</HI> the rest of the Bridge
was made of vessels locked together and fastened
with Anchors on each side. But more probable it is
that this was intended for a mole or peer to secure
the Harbour, and for Ships to lie behind, because
upon every peer a great stone perforated stands jet∣ting
out of tie vessels unto. That it was an ancient
<HI>Roman</HI> work the manner of the Arches, the figure of
the bricks, and the stateliness of it do sufficiently ar∣gue.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="149"/>
From <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> we passed over the Gulf to <HI>Baiae,</HI>
where are so many Antiquities, that to discourse fully
of them would require a volume alone. And others
having written at large of them both in <HI>English</HI> and
<HI>Latine,</HI> I shall not so much as mention any thing save
only the sweating vault being one of the grots called
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">i. e. The Baths of <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itoli.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Bagne de Tritoli.</HI> It is a long and narrow pas∣sage
like the entry into some room, the upper part
whereof is so hot, that a man cannot endure to walk
upright, being then in danger to be stifled by the
hot and suffocating vapour with which the upper
part of the Vault is filled: the lower part though
not cold is yet tolerable. Indeed one would not think
there could be so great a difference in so small a di∣stance.
He therefore that goes in there is necessitated
to stoop low; for if you do but hold up your hand it
sweats suddenly. We observed that of the lower
part of this vault where it was cool the sides were a
firm stone, but of the upper part where it was hot,
a soft, friable, yet unctuous yellow clay. It seemed to
us to have a mixture of sulphur and fixt salt deli∣quated
in it, but we made no trial of it by fire or
otherwise. Where this <HI>stratum</HI> or region of clay be∣gins
there precisely doth the heat begin; so that
where the region of clay goes lower there you must
stoop lower to avoid the heat. In this hot steam
there is a watery vapour conteined, as appears by
the drops notwithstanding all the heat condensed on
the sides of the vault as on an Alembic head. As we
returned we viewed the new Mountain, called by
some<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">i. e. The Mountain of ashes or cin∣ders.</NOTE> <HI>Monte di cenere,</HI> raised by an Earth-quake
<HI>Septemb.</HI> 29. 1538, of about an hundred foot per∣pendicular
altitude; though others make it much
higher, according to <HI>Stephanus Pighius</HI> it is a mile
ascent to the top, and 4 miles round at the foot. We
judg'd it nothing near so great. The people say it bears
nothing; nothing of any use of profit I suppose they
mean, else I am sure there grows <HI>Heath, Myrtle,
<PB N="274" REF="150"/>
Mastich-tree,</HI> and other shrubs upon it. It is a spungy
kind of earth, and makes a great sound under a mans
feet that stamps upon it. The same Earthquake threw
up so much earth stones, and ashes as quite filled up
the <HI>Lacus Lucrinus,</HI> so that there is nothing now left
of it but a fenny meadow. In our return from <HI>Poz∣zuolo</HI>
we viewed the mountain called <HI>Solfatara,</HI> an∣ciently
<HI>Campi Phlegraei,</HI> which continually burns.
On the top of the mountain is a large excavated oval
place like an Amphitheater, in length 1500 foot, in
breadth 1000; where the burning is. There are se∣veral
holes or vents where the smoke issues out, as
out of a furnace. We gathered perfect flowers of
sulphur to appearance, and salt-Armoniac sticking to
the mouths of these vents. If you thrust a Sword or
any iron instrument into one of the holes where the
smoke comes out, and suddainly draw it back again,
you shall see it all over bedewed or thick set with
drops of water. Whence it is manifest that this smoke
is not only a dry exhalation, but hath also good
quantity of the vapour of water mixt with it. We
observed that these <HI>flores</HI> of <HI>Sulphur</HI> would not burn,
nor easily melt over the fire, by reason of the ad∣mixture
of some heterogeneous body with them.
The stones and earth of this mountain are crusted
over with these flowers of Brimstone, which they
gather and distil Brimstone out of. As one walks
heer the earth makes a noise, as if it were hollow
underneath, and one may perfectly hear as it were
the hissing and boiling of some melted mineral, me∣tal
or other liquor just under ones feet. One that
should see this smoke, hear this noise and feel the
heat would wonder that the mountain should not
suddenly break out into a flame. This great hollow
above was I suppose excavated partly by force of the
burning, the earth sinking down, and partly by pa∣ring
away the top to distil for Brimstone.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="150"/>
Five miles distant from <HI>Naples</HI> is the mountain
<HI>Vesuvius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vesuvius.</NOTE> so famous in all ages for its burning. The
ground all about the sides of it we found covered
with cinders and pumice stones, which had been cast
out in the time of the burnings. We observed also
great channels, like gulls made by suddain torrents
and land-floods, which they told us were made by
water thrown out at the top of the mountain in the
conflagrations. Toward the top grew very few
plants. <HI>Acetosa ovilla</HI> where nothing else was to be
seen: A little lower grew <HI>Colutea Scorpioides</HI> and
some shrubs of <HI>Poplar.</HI> Near the top the ascent was
steep, and very toilsome to get up. Upon the very
top is a great pit or hollow in form of an Amphi∣theater,
of about a mile round, caused by the fires
blowing up the upper part of the mountain several
times with great violence. There are still about the
bottom of this great cavity some small <HI>spiracula</HI> of
smoke, but inconsiderable and which seem'd not
to threaten any future eruption. We viewed the
cave called <HI>Grotta di cane</HI> near the <HI>Lago Agnano.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grot∣ta di cane.</NOTE> This
Grot is narrow and short. Whatever others have
written or said to the contrary, a man may without
any great prejudice go into and continue in it a long
time, even in the further end of it, as some of us
did above an hours space. The venenose vapour
(whether it be purely sulphureous or also Arsenical)
ascends not a foot from the ground, but so high as
it ascends one feels his feet and legs hot. If you hold
your head down near the ground where the vapour
is, you shall presently find a fierce sulphureous twinge
in your nose, just as if you held your head over
burning brimstone, or more violent, which makes
a man stagger at first stroke, and stifles before one be
aware. We carried with us a dog, which by hold∣ing
his nose down we almost killed suddainly; and
then throwing him into the lake to try whether that
would recover him (as is generally believed) the dog
<PB N="276" REF="151"/>
being not lively enough to swim was there drowned.
I believe if we had left him in the air he would have
recovered. We then put in a pullet, which was mor∣tified
immediately; next a frog, which held not
out long; and last of all a serpent, which lived about
half an hour. The steam, if you hold a candle where
it comes, presently puts it out. I believe this vapour
arises not only in this grot precisely, but also all
heerabout, as I am confident would be found were
there other grots dug out of the hill near it.</P>
<P>Going to this grot;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grot or Hole through Mount <HI>Pausilypus</HI></NOTE> we passed through the vault
or artificial high-way wherewith the mountain <HI>Pau∣silypus</HI>
is perforated, made by one <HI>Cocceius</HI> in 15 days.
It is said to be a mile in length, but we judged it not
above half an <HI>English</HI> mile. It is highest at each end,
and lowest in the middle, and yet there about 12
foot high; broad enough for two carts meeting to
pass one another. About the middle of the Vault it
is so dark (no light now coming in but at the ends)
that those who meet cannot see one another; and
therefore lest they should justle or fall foul one upon
upon another, they that go toward the Sea cry <HI>Alla
marina,</HI> and they which go into the Countrey cry
<HI>Alla montagna,</HI> so each take their left hand, and pass commodiously.
The ports may be seen from end to
end, and any where in the mid-way; but in cloudy
weather it is so dark in the middle that a man can
scarce see his hands held up to the light. This road
is much frequented; though the bottom be stone
yet is it very dusty. Near the end toward <HI>Naples</HI>
we saw a window at the top. They that write of
this grot mention two windows made by <HI>Alphonsus</HI>
the first King of <HI>Naples;</HI> but we saw only this,
which doth yield but little light.</P>

<P>In the night time we saw many Fisher-boats out
at Sea with a light at one end of them, to invite the
Fish to follow the Boat, where stands a fellow with
an instrument in his hand like a mole-spear ready to
strike them.</P>
<P>In the same Vessel which brought us to <HI>Naples</HI> we
began our voyage to <HI>Messina</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">April 29 Messina.</NOTE> where we ar∣rived
<HI>May</HI> 2. We sailed in sight of the <HI>Aeolides</HI> or
<HI>Vulcaniae insulae,</HI> two of which, <HI>viz. Stromboli</HI> and
<HI>Vulcano,</HI> do still burn; and <HI>Stromboli</HI> with that rage
sometimes that no man dares live upon it. As we
passed by in the night-time we saw it flame. It is dif∣ficult
to enter in at the mouth of the strait by the
<HI>Faro</HI> of <HI>Messina,</HI> because of the current, which runs
heer violently sometimes towards <HI>Calabria,</HI> some∣times
toward <HI>Sicily:</HI> so that Mariners who have not
often sailed this strait are forced to hire a Pilot of
<HI>Messina</HI> to conduct them in; who for the most part
when they see any Vessel coming go out in boats to
meet it, and offer their service to guide it into the
Harbour, for which they will be well paid; our Ca∣ptain
being forced to give ten pieces of Eight. The
Haven of <HI>Messina</HI> is very commodious and secure,
compassed almost round with the City on one side
and a narrow languet or neck of land on the other,
resembling a large Fishpond. The City makes a
goodly show as one comes to it by Sea, the houses all
along the shore being built of Free-stone, tall and
uniform, and having a fair broad Key before them.
But the streets within are narrow, not well paved,
nor the houses near so fair. So that it is a Proverb,
<HI>A Mess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na Assai polvere, pulce &amp; putane.</HI> At <HI>Messina</HI>
<PB N="279" REF="152"/>
you have dust, fleas, and whores store. This City
pretends to be the principal and <HI>metropolis</HI> of <HI>Sicily,</HI>
[<HI>Regni caput</HI>] and will be no means give place to
<HI>Palermo.</HI> The Vice-roy is obliged to reside 18 months
heer, and 18 at <HI>Palermo.</HI> They stand much upon
their privileges granted them by <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth
Emperor; and one privilege they have, not to shew
their privileges. They contend earnestly to have the
staple or monopoly of Silk heer, and had lately ob∣tained
a grant thereof from <HI>Spain:</HI> but the <HI>Paler∣mitans</HI>
seeing how much this would redound to
their prejudice, have got it reversed. It seems for∣merly
all the Silk made in <HI>Sicily</HI> was vended at <HI>Mes∣sina,</HI>
but by degrees <HI>Palermo</HI> hath got part of this
trade to its self, and now pleads prescription for it.
There is a great emulation and enmity between the
<HI>Palermitans</HI> and <HI>Messanese,</HI> which involves the whole
Island; some Cities taking part with one, and some
with the other. The titles the <HI>Messanese</HI> give their
City in their public instruments and writings are
the <HI>Noble</HI> and <HI>Exemplary</HI> City of <HI>Messina.</HI> The In∣habitants
are none of the most civil, but extraordi∣narily
proud, and ready to expel the Vice-roy if he
displeases them. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath 4 Castles
in and about this City, and the Citizens as many in
their hands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernment of <HI>Messina</HI></NOTE> The City Gates stand open all night,
so that its free for any man to enter in and go out at
pleasure. Their government among themselves is
by six <HI>Jurats,</HI> four of the Gentry, and two of the
Citizens. They are chosen after this manner. Every
year there is a certain number who do <HI>ambire ma∣gistratum,</HI>
or (as they phrase it) concur to come in
cap; sometimes more, sometimes fewer. The Gen∣tlemen
chuse by themselves, and the Citizens by
themselves. The names of all the Gentlemen of
aboue 25 years of age, and likewise of all the Ar∣tisans
and Tradesmen, are written in little scrolls of
paper, and those rolled up and cast upon a table.
<PB N="280" REF="153"/>
Then comes in the Kings delegate and takes up of
each heap of these scrolls to the number of 36, and
those are the Electors. These Electors are brought
into a room where are boxes set according to the
number of Competitors, and have balls given them
blue and white; the blue affirmative, and the white
negative; and they give to every one of the Candi∣dates
their suffrages as they please. Those eight of
the Noblemen and four of the Citizens which have
most suffrages are elected, and come in cap. Now on
the first of <HI>May</HI> these 12 have their names written in
little scrolls of paper put in a cap; and a little boy puts
his hand in, and takes out one by one to the num∣ber
of six; and those six are the Jurats for that year.
The Jurats for the Nobility though they be the grea∣ter
number, yet can they do nothing without the
consent of one of the Jurats for the Citizens. After
all this stir these Jurats have but little power, nothing
to do either in civil or criminal causes of any mo∣ment.</P>

<P>And now that I have named so many Strangers,
let no man imagine that there are no Plants common
to <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>England;</HI> for that is so far from be∣ing
true, that I believe there be but few Plants grow∣ing
in <HI>England</HI> but may somewhere or other be
found in <HI>Sicily.</HI> There is in this respect great diffe∣rence
between Northern and Southern Countreys,
the Southern having a vast number of species which
<PB N="285" REF="155"/>
the Northern miss, whereas the Northern have but
few which are wanting in the Southern. And the
reason is obvious, because there are places in Sou∣thern
Countreys which agree with the Northern in
the temperature of the air; as for example, the
sides and tops of mountains: but no places in the
Northern which have like temperature of air with
the Southern. Form this experiment I have made
in comparing <HI>England</HI> with <HI>Sicily</HI> I am induced to
believe, that there are are scarce any two Countreys
in this Continent so far remote the one from the
other, but they have some common plants, however
it be thought there be none common to <HI>America</HI> and
this Continent; which I cannot but wonder at, and
wish it were more diligently enquired into.</P>
<P>We hired a <HI>Feluca</HI> to carry us to <HI>Malta</HI> and back
again.<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 5.</NOTE> The first day being <HI>May</HI> 6. we had a brisk
gale of wind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Catania.</NOTE> which brought us into <HI>Catania,</HI> 60
miles distant from <HI>Messina,</HI> by 3 of the clock after∣noon.
Heer as in <HI>Spain</HI> we were fain to go into the
Market to buy all our provision of bread, meat, and
drink our selves. This is but a mean Town, only
some good Cloysters there are in it. We heard much
of S. <HI>Agatha</HI> their peculiar protecteress. <HI>May</HI> 7. We
proceeded as far as <HI>Syracusa,</HI> 40 miles by the way we
had in prospect <HI>Augusta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Augusta.</NOTE> famous for the goodness of
the wine there made, and sent abroad to <HI>Messina,
Malta,</HI> and other places.</P>
<P><HI>Syracusa</HI> that now is stands in a <HI>Peninsula,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Syracusa</NOTE> and is
only that part of the ancient <HI>Syracusae</HI> called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
It is at present but a small City, indifferently well
built and thinly inhabited. It is fortified with very
strong walls and bastions, especially towards the
land. These works they told us were made by the
<HI>Knights Hospitallers,</HI> when they were driven out of
<HI>Rhodes</HI> by the <HI>Turks.</HI> They then intended to have
settled themselves heer, but the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI>
V. not liking their company in <HI>Sicily,</HI> gave them
<PB N="286" REF="156"/>
<HI>Malta.</HI> About a mile and half from the present City
we saw some ruines of the ancient <HI>Syracusae,</HI> among
other things the <HI>rudera</HI> of an <HI>Amphitheater.</HI> We saw
also what is commonly shew'd to all Strangers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grot called <HI>Dionysius</HI> his ear.</NOTE> the
Grot at present called <HI>orecchio di Dionysio</HI> or <HI>Dionysius</HI>
his ear, becuase it is hewn out of the Rock in fa∣shion
of a mans ear. They fancy that <HI>Dionysius</HI> had a
Chamber above this Cave or Grot, wherein he sate
and over-heard whatever was spoken or but whis∣pered
in the Grot below, where he used to put suspe∣cted
persons together in prison. The Grot is cut out
of the side of a high Cliff or Rock, and is it self ve∣ry
high, and goes a little winding, but is not long.
In our return from <HI>Malta</HI> we entred into and viewed
one of the ancient <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or burying places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The an∣cient <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> now cal∣led Cata∣cumbe.</NOTE>
which they all <HI>Catacumbe,</HI> and of which there are
several both heer and in <HI>Malta.</HI> That we entred into
was of S. <HI>Antonio</HI>'s Church. Heerin were many
vaulted or arched walks hewn out of the Rock, and
on each hand all along other vaults at right angles
with them, the floor or bottom of which lateral
vaults was some foot and half higher then the floor
of the main walk, and all hewn into troughs or <HI>lo∣culi,</HI>
wherein they deposited their dead bodies; in
some of these were 20 <HI>loculi,</HI> in some more, in some
less. In this <HI>coemeterium</HI> at intervals are round rooms
or halls cupoloed, where several of the forementi∣oned
walks meet: for the whole is a kind of maze
or labyrinth, and very difficult to thread, being of a
huge extent: so that I believe there were many
thousands of bodies laid up heer. These <HI>cuniculi</HI> or
vaulted walks are in many places earth'd and stopt
up by stones and rubbish fallen from the roof. They
told us that the Vault of S. <HI>Lucia</HI> reacht as far as <HI>Ca∣tania</HI>
under ground, which though it be a monstrous
untruth, yet we may thence gather, <HI>Multum esse

saw our Seamen take several Tortoises on this man∣ner.
When they espy a Tortoise floting on the top
of the water (as they can easily do at a good di∣stance)
with as little noise as they can possibly they
bring their boat up close to him; then they either
catch him with their hands and draw him up into
the boat, or if they cannot get near enough to do
so, one leaps out of the boat into the Sea, and turns
the Tortoise on his back, and then with ease drives
him before him up to the boat; the Tortoise being
not able to turn himself or swim away on his back.
They say (and it is not unlikely) that the Tortoise
while he flotes thus upon the water sleeps; which is
the reason why they are so still and make so little
noise in bringing their boat up to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bernacle∣shells growing upon the back of a Tortoise.</NOTE> One of these
Tortoises which they caught had two great bunches
of those they call <HI>Bernacle-shells</HI> sticking or growing
to his back, and some of them the largest and fair∣est
of that kind which we have seen. As for that
opinion of a bird breeding in them (which some
<PB N="291" REF="158"/>
have affirmed with much confidence, (and of which
<HI>Michael Meyerus</HI> hath written a whole Book) it is
without all doubt false and frivolous. The Bernacles
which are said to be bred in them being hatcht of
eggs of their own laying like other birds; the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI>
in their third Voyage to discover the North∣east
passage to <HI>Cathaia</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> in 80 degrees, 11
minutes of Northern latitude, having found two
Islands, in one of which they observed a great num∣ber
of these Geese sitting on their eggs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as Dr.
<HI>Johnson</HI> relates out of <HI>Pontanus.</HI> As for these shells,
they are a kind of <HI>Balanus marinus,</HI> as <HI>Fabius Co∣lumna</HI>
proves, never coming to be other then what
they are, but only growing in bigness as other shells
do. All the ground of this fancy (as I conceive)
is because this fish hath a bunch of <HI>cirri,</HI> some∣what
resembling a tuft of Feathers, or the tail
a Bird, which it sometimes puts out into the
water, and draws back again. We were much
surprised to find of this shell-fish in these Seas so
southernly and far from the scene of the Bernacle∣fable.</P>

<HEAD>OF
MALTA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Island of <HI>Malta</HI> is 20 miles long, 12
miles broad, and 60 miles in circuit; distant
from the <HI>primo terreno</HI> or nearest part of <HI>Sicily</HI> 60
miles; from the Cape of <HI>Calipia</HI> anciently called
<HI>Promontorium Mercurii,</HI> the nearest point of the Con∣tinent
of <HI>Africa,</HI> 200 miles, (as divers of the
most skilful and experienced Pilots did affirm to
<HI>Abela</HI> for an undoubted truth) from the Cape of
<HI>Spartivento</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> but 190. So that upon account
of vicinity it is rather to be attributed to <HI>Europe</HI>
than <HI>Africa;</HI> especially if we allow <HI>Sicily</HI> to have
been of old time united to and so part of the Con∣tinent.
The reason why others make it a member of
<HI>Africa</HI> is because the present Inhabitants of the
Countrey speak a kind of <HI>Moresco</HI> or <HI>Arabic.</HI></P>
<P>The old City, called <HI>Città notabile,</HI> situate about
the middle of the Island, hath 35 degrees, 15 mi∣nutes
of Northern latitude, and the longest day
there is of 14 hours, 52 minutes.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant that <HI>Heylin</HI> and others, who
reckon this among the Isles of <HI>Africa,</HI> place it nearer
the Coast of <HI>Barbary,</HI> assign it less latitude, and al∣low
the longest day no more then 14 hours; but I
do in these and other particulars follow the more
accurate observations of <HI>Johannes Franciscus Abela,</HI>
a learned man and native of this Island, in his <HI>Mal∣ta
illustrata,</HI> written in <HI>Italian</HI> and published in <HI>Mal∣ta,
Anno</HI> 1646. in <HI>folio.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Island from the shallowness of its soil,
there being in few places above two foot depth of
<PB N="294" REF="160"/>
of earth before you come to firm stone; and from
the lowness of its situation, not much elevated above
the level of the water and having no considerable
hill in it, seems to have been in the most ancient
times nothing else but a great Rock, wholly over∣whelmed
and covered with the Sea; especially if
we consider the multitude of Sea shells of all sorts,
Sharks teeth, vertebres of Thornbacks and other
fish bones petrified found all over the Island even in
the highest parts of it, and most remote from the
shore. For that these were formed by some plastick
power in the stone-quarries, being nothing else but
the effects or productions of nature sporting her
self in imitation of the parts and shells of these ani∣mals,
I can hardly be induced to believe; nature
(which indeed is nothing else but the ordinary power
of God) not being so wanton and toyish as to form
such elegant figures without further end of design
than her own pastime and diversion. But a very like∣ly
thing it is, that the Sea being shallow above this
Rock for some ages before it came to be uncovered,
there should great beds of Shell-fish harbour and
breed in so convenient a place, and the water leaving
them their shells remain and petrifie. I confess its
hard to imagine, how the carcasses of so many
Sharks should come to be lodged heer as by the mul∣titude
of teeth that have been for so many years past,
and are still daily digg'd up, we must needs grant;
unless perchance they remain of the heads of such
Sharks as were caught and eaten by the Fisher-men,
who it is likely after the discovery of this Rock fre∣quented
heer and made it a station for fishing before
it came to be inhabited.</P>
<P>To this difficulty Mr. <HI>Steno</HI> returns answer in these
particulars, 1. That such Sharks or Sea dogs have
each of them 60 teeth and more, and that all the
time they live they breed new teeth. 2. That the Sea
agitated by the winds is wont of protrude thosebo∣bodies
<PB N="295" REF="160" MS="y"/>
it meets with towards some one place, and
there heap them together. 3. That Sharks swim in
great troops or sholes, and consequently that the
teeth of many of them may have been left in one
place. 4. That in the <HI>Malta</HI> earth besides these
Sharks teeth are found also sundry Cochle-shells;
so that if the number of teeth should encline a man
to ascribe their production to the earth, on the other
hand, the make of the same teeth, and the abun∣dance
of them in every animal, and the earth like
the bottom of the Sea, and other marine bodies
found in the same place do favour the contrary opi∣nion.</P>
<P>The soil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The na∣ture of the Soil.</NOTE> notwithstanding the rockiness and shal∣lowness
of it, hath been by the Ancients celebrated
for fertility;
<Q>Fertilis est Melite sterili vicina Cosyroe
Insula. <HI>Ovid. Fast.</HI></Q>
But undeservedly if we understand it of Corn; for
there is not much Wheat sown heer, and that we
saw upon the grounds was but thin and slight. And
though Barley be their chief crop, and of which
the Countrey people make their bread; yet have
they not near enough of that to serve the ordinary
uses of the Inhabitants; so that they are forc'd to
fetch most of their Bread-corn out of <HI>Sicily</HI></P>
<P>The main commodities which the Island yields,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commo∣dities of <HI>Malia.</HI></NOTE>
wherewith the Inhabitants drive a good trade and
inrich themselves, are 1. <HI>Cumin-seed,</HI> which they
call <HI>Cumino agro</HI> or sharp Cumin; of which are
gathered about 3000 <HI>Cantares</HI> yearly; one <HI>Cantare</HI>
being equal to 116 pound weight <HI>English.</HI> 2. <HI>An∣nise-seed,</HI>
which they call <HI>Sweet-cumin,</HI> of which
are gathered and transmitted into Foreign parts
1000 <HI>Cantares</HI> yearly. These seeds are sold at 7, 8,
or 9 crowns the <HI>Cantare:</HI> and we were told that the
<PB N="296" REF="161"/>
year before our being there [<HI>Ann.</HI> 1663.] were ven∣ded
7000 <HI>Cantares</HI> of both sorts. 3. Cotton-wool,
called in <HI>Latine Xylon</HI> or <HI>Gossipium,</HI> of which they
send abroad yearly 14000 <HI>Cantares</HI> in the husk.</P>
<P>They have of late begun to plant <HI>Indigo,</HI> which
my Author saith agrees with the soil, and likes and
thrives there very well. He also mentions a sort of
excrescence or moss or scurf, which the Rocks about
<HI>S. Maria el Aalia</HI> and other places on the North side
of the Island naturally put forth, called by the Coun∣trey
people <HI>Vercella,</HI> which they scrape off with an
iron instrument, and having washed it with a cer∣tain
liquor, and mingled it with other Ingredients
[He tells us not what that liquor or those ingredients
are] they expose it to the Sun, and use it to dye
wool of a carnation colour. This kind of moss, cal∣led
in <HI>Wales Kenkerig,</HI> and in <HI>England Cork</HI> or <HI>Ar∣cel,</HI>
is gathered and used for the same purpose in
<HI>Wales</HI> and the North of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Malta</HI> hath been famous of old for a breed of lit∣tle
Dogs called <HI>Catuli Melitaei,</HI> the race whereof is
quite extinct: and now their Cats are as much
esteemed. The Roses of <HI>Malta</HI> contend for sweet∣ness
with those of <HI>Paestum;</HI> and the Honey with
that of <HI>Hybla</HI> or <HI>Hymettus:</HI> So that some suppose
this Island had its name <HI>Melita</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifying
honey.</P>
<P>The air is clear and healthful, and the people long
lived. Not much rain falls heer, yet sufficient to sup∣ply
water to feed their springs; of which there are
several in the high grounds, or small hills about the
middle of the Island.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ori∣ginal of Springs.</NOTE> That these Springs proceed
from rain-water only my Author doth very well
prove, because they are found only at the foot of
little hills, consisting of a certain porous stone
which the <HI>Maltese</HI> call <HI>Giorgiolena,</HI> or a chalky earth
which easily imbibes the rain. And to speak in ge∣neral,
that all springs and running waters owe their
<PB N="297" REF="161"/>
rise and continuance to rain, seems to me more than
probable; 1. Because I never yet saw any springing
or running waters breaking out, either on the top of a
hill or so near the top, but that there was earth enough
above them to feed such Springs, considering the con∣dition
of high mountains, which are almost con∣stantly
moistned with clouds, and on which the Sun∣beams
have but little force: and yet I have made it
part of my business in viewing the highest hills in
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> to examine this particular. Nor
have I yet ever observed such springing and running
waters in any plain, unless there were hills so near,
that one might reasonably conclude they were fed by
them. 2. Many springs quite fail in dry Summers,
and generally all abate considerably of their waters.
I am not ignorant that some make a distinction be∣tween
failing springs and enduring springs, and
would have the former to proceed from rain, and the
latter from the Sea, but I see no sufficient foundati∣on
for such a distinction, and do think that both the
one and the other are to be attributed to rain; the
failing and enduring being to be referred either to
the different quantity and thickness of earth that
feeds them; or to the different quality, the one more
quickly the other more slowly transmitting the wa∣ter,
or some such like accident. 3. In clay grounds,
into which the water sinks with difficulty, one shall
seldom find any springs, but in sandy, gravelly, rocky,
stony or other grounds into which the rain can easily
make its way; one seldom fails of them. 4. They
who would have fountains to arise from and to be fed
by the Sea have not as yet given a satisfactory account
of the ascent of water to the tops of mountains and
its efflux there. For though water will creep up a
filtre above its level, yet I question whether to so
great an excess above its <HI>aequilibrium</HI> with the air,
whereas in pumps we see it will not rise above two
or three and thirty foot; or if it should, whether it
<PB N="298" REF="162"/>
would there run out at the top of the filtre, we not
having as yet heard of any experiment that will
countenance such a thing. For the ascent and efflux
of sap in trees I suspect may be owing to a higher
principle then purely mechanical. As for the <HI>Sabu∣lum
Quellem</HI> or <HI>Arena bulliens</HI> of <HI>Helmont,</HI> I look upon
it as an extravagant conceit of his; and yet some
ground there is to believe, that there is a kind of
earth lying up and down in veins, which doth like
a filtre retain the water and carry or derive it along
as it lies from place to place, till it brings it to the
<HI>supersicies</HI> of the earth, where it runs out. In other
places there are subterraneous channels like the veins
in animals, whereinto the water soaking into the
earth is gathered, and wherein it runs as above
ground out of smaller rivulets into greater streams:
and where one of these veins opens in the <HI>superficies</HI>
of the earth there is a spring greater or lesser accord∣ing
to the magnitude of the vein. Nor need we won∣der
that springs should endure the length of a dry
Summer, for in many sorts of earth the water makes
its way but slowly; since we see that in those troughs
or leches, wherein Landresses put ashes, and there∣upon
water to make a <HI>lixivium,</HI> the water will be of∣ten
many hours before it gets all through the ash, and
the Lech ceases to drop; and in many Chymical pre∣parations
which are filtred, its long before the li∣quor
can free it self and wholly drain away from the
earthy and feculent part.</P>
<P>Some attribute the original of fountains to wa∣tery
vapours elevated by subterraneous fires, or at
least by that generally diffused heat which Miners
find in the earth when they come to 50 or 60 fa∣thoms
under ground; and condensed by the tops and
sides of the mountains as by an Alembick head, and
so distilling down and breaking out where they find
issue. And in reason one would think, that generally
the deeper one digs in the earth the colder one should
<PB N="299" REF="162"/>
find it, sith the Urinators affirm that the deeper
they dive in the Sea the colder still they find the wa∣ter.
And yet were there such subterraneous heats,
they are not so great as that it is likely they should
elevate vapours so high, through so thick a coat of
earth, which it must be an intense heat indeed will
carry them through, which heat none say is found
near the superficies of the earth.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hook</HI>'s account, <HI>viz.</HI> that salt water being hea∣vier
than fresh, by reason of its preponderancy it may
drive up the fresh as high above the surface of the
Sea as are the tops of mountains before it comes to
an <HI>aequilibrium</HI> with it, is very ingenious, and would
be most likely, were there continued close channels
from the bottom of the Sea to the tops of mountains,
not admitting the air, which I believe will not be
found in many places.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ebbing and flow∣ing Well<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> What is said about ebbing and
flowing wells in confirmation of it, adds no strength;
for none of those ebbing and flowing wells that I
have yet seen do at all observe the motion of the Sea,
but reciprocate two or three times or oftner every
hour, excepting one on the Coast of <HI>South-Wales</HI> in
a sandy ground by the Sea-side not ¼ of a mile from
the water, which observes the Tides; but it is no
running water, nor doth it I believe arise above the
level of the Sea. I do therefore shrewdly suspect for
fabulous whatever hath been written of Wells remote
from the Sea, which in their ebbing and flowing ob∣serve
its motions. But for a reason of the ebbing and
flowing of these Wells I must confess I am hitherto
at a great loss. Whereas some say that rain sinks not
above a foot or two deep into the earth, if they un∣derstand
it of all earths it is manifestly false, for that
we see in Coal delfs, and other mines in wet weather
the Miners are many times drown'd out (as they
phrase it) though no water run down into the
mouths of their pits and shafts; and in sandy and
heathy grounds in the greatest rains little water runs
<PB N="300" REF="163"/>
off the land, as on <HI>Newmarket-heath, Gogmagog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hills,
Salisbury-plain, &amp;c.</HI> and therefore it must needs sink
in: and out of the mouth of <HI>Pool-hole</HI> near <HI>Buxton</HI> in
the <HI>Peak</HI> of <HI>Derby</HI> and other Caves in the sides of
mountains in rainy seasons streams of water many
times run out, where in dry weather and Summer
time there are none.</P>
<P>Neither is this opinion we defend any more re∣pugnant
to the Scripture then the other. For where∣as
it is said, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 1. 7. <HI>All the rivers run into the
sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence
the rivers come thither they return again;</HI> we grant it
to be most true; nay we think such a circulation ab∣solutely
necessary to the being of springs, only we
assert it to be performed not under ground but
above: that is, the clouds take up water out of the
Sea, and pour it down again upon the earth; and
from part thereof falling upon and soaking into the
higher grounds arise the springs.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Malta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ha∣ven.</NOTE> the Haven is very commo∣dious
and secure, divided into two by a little pro∣montory
or neck of land some 1500 canes long, and

The new City called <HI>Valetta</HI> is divided into 20
streets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new City cal∣led <HI>Va∣letta.</HI></NOTE> 8 in length and 12 in breadth, all streight.
Though they be not paved, yet they need it not, the
Town being built upon a solid rock. They want no
uniformity but being level, which the place being
uneven, uphill and down-hill, will not admit. The
houses are all of stone, flat-rooft and covered with
<PB N="301" REF="163"/>
plaister, which is sufficient heer, there falling but lit∣tle
rain; though they be not tall yet are they neat
and pleasant. Upon the roofs of their houses in
Summer time the people set their beds, as at <HI>Aleppo,</HI>
and sleep in the open air. The number of the Inha∣bitants
of all ages, according to a survey taken in the
year 1632, was 10744, the number of houses 1891,

by the Knights, <HI>viz.</HI> such a number of Knights are
appointed to carry them their meat daily with cap
in hand; which thing we saw them do in this man∣ner.
The meat was all brought into the middle of a
great room where many of the sick lay. Then one of
the Knights (the Steward I suppose he was) read the
names of the sick one by one out of the Physicians
bill, wherein was prescribed each sick persons diet.
As he read a name the Cook took his part whose
name was read, and dishing it up delivered it to one
of the Knights, who carried it to his bed-side, where
stood a stool covered with a napkin having bread
and salt upon it. This duty their very name inti∣mates
to belong to them; <HI>viz.</HI> Knights, <HI>i. e.</HI> Servants
of the Hospital, and therefore we may be excused if
we have been more particular and circumstantial in
describing the manner of it. If any of the Order
falls sick, he is not to stay in a private house but must
presently repair hither, where he is most carefully
tended, one or two Knights being appointed to be
always by him.</P>

several Apartments for Winter and Summer. There
is also a stable of good horses, in which besides
coach-horses and ordinary saddle-horses, are kept
40 or 50 great horses. A thing worth the nothing in
this Island, where there is so great scarcity of horses,
that Knights and persons of quality ride upon no
better then asses.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="165"/>
The <HI>Slaves prison,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The slaves prison.</NOTE> a fair square building, where <MILESTONE N="8"/>
all the Slaves in the City lodge every night so long as
the Gallies are abroad in <HI>Corso.</HI> At the ringing of
the <HI>Ave-Mary bell,</HI> which is just at Sun-set, they are
to repair thither. When the Gallies are at home
those that belong to private persons are permitted to
lodge in their Masters houses. The number of Slaves
now in Town was about 2000 belonging to the Or∣der,
and 300 to private persons, besides those that
were abroad in the Gallies.</P>
<P>Besides this new City there are 3 considerable
Towns distant from it only by the breadth of the
haven.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Isola.</HI></NOTE> 1. The <HI>Isola</HI> (as they commonly call it) or
Town of <HI>Senglea,</HI> with the Fort of <HI>S. Michael,</HI> sea∣ted
in a <HI>Peninsula</HI> made by 2 creeks running out of
the principal haven. It contains 994 houses and
4050 souls. For the stout resistance it made to the
<HI>Turks</HI> in 1565 it obtained the name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The in∣vincible City.</NOTE> <HI>Città in∣vitta.</HI>
2. The <HI>Borgo</HI> (as they call it) i. e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Borgho.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Burgo del
Castello à mare,</HI> built likewise on a little <HI>Lingua</HI> or
neck of land between two creeks of the same haven,
on the utmost cape whereof stands the Castle of St.
<HI>Angelo</HI> divided for greater strength from the Town
by a ditch of water cut cross the <HI>lingua.</HI> This Burgh
contains 782 houses and 3063 souls. For its valour
and fidelity in holding out so resolutely against the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Army besieging it, <HI>Anno</HI> 1565, it is deser∣vedly
honoured with the title of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The victori∣ous City.</NOTE> <HI>Città vittoriosa.</HI>
Between these two Burghs is a secure Harbour where
the Gallies and most of the other Vessels of the Ci∣ty
lie; which in time of danger is shut up with a
great iron chain. 3. <HI>Birmula,</HI> rather a suburb of
<HI>Senglea</HI> then a distinct Town: it contains 642 fires
and 2778 souls.</P>
<P>We rode out to see some part of the Countrey;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 25. The old City.</NOTE>
passing two great Villages (<HI>Casales</HI> they name them)
we came to the <HI>old City</HI> called anciently <HI>Melita</HI> after
the name of the Island, now <HI>Città notabile,</HI> a small
<PB N="306" REF="166"/>
place at present but wel fortified, containing no
more then 565 houses and 2620 souls. It hath been
formerly much greater, and incomparably more po∣pulous.
The <HI>new City,</HI> as being more conveniently
situate, daily draining away and withdrawing its in∣habitants.
Heer they shew'd us the Pillar of <HI>S. Paul</HI>
(as they call it) where when he stood preaching (as
they fondly believe or at least would perswade us)
his voice was heard distinctly all over the Island.
2. The <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> Heer out of a small cave is
taken that white earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Terra di <HI>S.</HI> Paolo, <HI>or</HI> Sigil∣lata M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li∣tensis.</NOTE> called <HI>Terra di S. Paolo</HI> and
by some <HI>terra sigillata Melitensis,</HI> which they seal and
sell to strangers, attributing thereto great vertues
against all poison and infection. This cavern though
there be continually great quantities of earth taken
out of it, according to their conceited tradition, re∣tains
still the same dimensions, becoming no grea∣ter
then it was at first. That <HI>S. Paul</HI> suffered ship∣wrack
on the coast of this island, and wintered heer,
and not on that other <HI>Melita</HI> in the <HI>Adriatic</HI> Sea on
the coast of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> now called <HI>Meleda,</HI> I think it
sufficiently proved and made clear by <HI>Cluverius, Abela</HI>
and others: but that upon occasion of a Viper fast∣ning
on his arm he changed all the Serpents of the
Island into stones, and endued the earth with an
Alexipharmical quality to resist and expel poison, is
a superstitious and ungrounded fancy.</P>
<P>From the old City we rode on to the <HI>Great Ma∣sters
Boschetto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gr. Masters <HI>Boschetto.</HI></NOTE> where he hath a pretty little Palace in
form of a Castle, from the top whereof we had a
good prospect of the Island. Heer are a great num∣ber
of Gardens and Orchards well furnished with
all sorts of fruits and flowers; good water-works
and a grove of trees: indeed this Palace wants no∣thing
for conveniency or delight. The Palace is si∣tuate
upon a little hill, and the gardens lie under it
in a hollow or bottom, almost compassed about
with rocks.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="166"/>
But to speak of the Island in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seve∣ral Inha∣bitants and Con∣quests of <HI>Malta.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Malta</HI> hath
been inhabited by several Nations and often changed
masters. The most ancient Inhabitants are by <HI>Cluve∣rius</HI>
taken to have been the <HI>Phaeaces</HI> mentioned by
<HI>Homer,</HI> who were expelled by the <HI>Phaenicians.</HI> The
<HI>Phaenicians</HI> were most of them driven out by the
<HI>Grecians.</HI> After this is changed Masters rather than
Inhabitants, being first subdued and held by the <HI>Car∣thaginians;</HI>
then for a long time by the <HI>Romans:</HI> af∣ter
that the <HI>Goths</HI> came hither, who were driven out
by the <HI>Eastern Emperours.</HI> Next the <HI>Saracens</HI> possest
themselves of it. The <HI>Normans</HI> expelled them and
got the dominion. Then the <HI>Germans</HI> or <HI>Suevi</HI> be∣came
Lords of it; then the <HI>French;</HI> then the <HI>Ara∣gonians,</HI>
and <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and now last of all the or∣der
of the Knights Hospitallers. The History of all
which changes if any man desire to be fully and par∣ticularly
acquainted with, let him consult <HI>Abela.</HI> In
all these changes it followed for the most part the for∣tune
of <HI>Sicily,</HI> as having little strength to resist any
foreign power invading. It is now so well fortified
and manned that it would prove a very difficult mat∣ter
for the greatest Prince or Potentate in the world
to take it by force; having when it was in far worse
condition then now it is resisted and baffled the Arms
of one of the greatest Emperours the <HI>Turks</HI> ever had.</P>
<P>It is very populous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number of the villages and peo∣ple.</NOTE> containing betwee 30 and
40 great <HI>Casales</HI> or Villages, some of them of above
500 houses, more like to great Towns than Villages,
and 26 Parish Churches, beside those of <HI>Gozo.</HI> The
number of fighting men was said to be about a 5000,
but I believe there are scarce so many, for according
to a survey taken in the year 1632 the whole number
of souls upon the Island besides the Knights was but
50112; of which we cannot reckon much above
one fifth part to be fighting men. And though since
that time the number of Inhabitants be much encrea∣sed,
yet I think scarce doubled.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="167"/>
The language of the Natives is a corrupt <HI>Arabic</HI>
or <HI>Moresco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The lan∣guage.</NOTE> introduced by the <HI>Saracens,</HI> the ancient
language before their coming in probably having
been <HI>Greek,</HI> with a mixture of <HI>Punick:</HI> whence I
think one may reasonably conjecture that the <HI>Sara∣cens</HI>
did either destroy or drive out the former Inha∣bitants.
Howbeit the people can generally speak <HI>Ita∣lian,</HI>
there being no other language but that and <HI>La∣tine</HI>
used in any of the Courts of <HI>Malta.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Great Master</HI> of the Order is now Prince and
supreme Governour of the whole Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gr. Master Prince of the Island.</NOTE> which
with <HI>Gozo</HI> and the adjacent islets, after the loss of
<HI>Rhodes</HI> was granted to this Order by the Emperour
<HI>Charles</HI> V. in the year 1530. The Government is
managed with that prudence and justice, that the
Island is now in a very flourishing condition, the
Inhabitants enjoying a great deal of freedom and se∣curity;
being also in their carriage and conversation
among themselves and to Strangers since the coming
in of the Order very civil and courteous, however
formerly they have been branded for the contrary: so
that few subjects live more happily then they do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Master</HI> when he goeth abroad it atten∣ded
by many of the Knights, and 2 or 3 Pages, of
which he keeps (as we were told) about 24. The
Knights of the Order are always uncovered in the
presence of the Great Master, excepting those 16
which are of the <HI>Gran Croce:</HI> they take place, of
what birth or quality soever they are, according to
their seniority from the time of their admission; so
that there is never any difficulty or question about
precedency. All the Knights are of noble or gentile
extraction, none being capable of admission but
such as can prove their Gentility for three or four de∣scents.
The <HI>Great Master</HI> wears a black short Gown
with hanging sleeves, the rest of the Knights are ha∣bited
as they please at home, but when they go <HI>in
Curso</HI> (as they call it) upon the Gallies they wear
<PB N="309" REF="167"/>
the proper habit belonging to their Order. The
number of Knights was said to be between 2000 and
3000, of which for the most part reside in the City
the major part, except when the Gallies are abroad.
The name of the Great Master at our being there
was <HI>Nicolaus Cottoner</HI> of <HI>Majorca,</HI> and I suppose he
is still living, not having since heard of his death.</P>

<P>59. <HI>Raphael Cotoner</HI> of <HI>Majorca,</HI> who died in the

<P>About 5 miles distant from <HI>Malta</HI> Westward lies
the Island <HI>Gozo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gozo.</NOTE> called by the ancients <HI>Gaulos,</HI> 12
miles long; 6½ broad, and about 30 in circuit. The
soil like that of <HI>Sicily</HI> very deep and fruitful of
Wheat and other grain. This Island is mountain∣ous,
yet all cultivated, furnished with store of fresh
sorings. It maintains upon it 3000 persons, the num∣ber
of houses being about 500. It was much more
populous before the <HI>Turkish Armata</HI> most inhumanely
wasted it in the year 1565, carrying away prisoners
6000 persons.</P>
<P>In the streight betwixt <HI>Malta</HI> and <HI>Gozo</HI> lies a little
Island called <HI>Comina,</HI> anciently, according to <HI>Cluve∣rius,
Hephaestia,</HI> about 5 miles in compass and well
cultivated; for the defence whereof the Gr. Master
<HI>Wignacourt</HI> caused a Fort to be built opposite to that
on the other side the streight in <HI>Gozo,</HI> to secure the
streight and hinder any vessels passing between the
Islands without leave.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="168" MS="y"/>
That there is great plenty of shells and fish-bones
petrified found in <HI>Malta,</HI> I have already intimated. I
shall now therefore only name those which are not
at all or but rarely found with us in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>Glossopetrae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pe∣trified shells in <HI>Malta,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> which are nothing else but Sharks
teeth, of several shapes and sizes. These the <HI>Maltese</HI>
call <HI>Serpents Tongues.</HI> 2. The Vertebres of Thorn∣backs
and other cartilagineous fishes. 3. <HI>Cats heads</HI>
(as they call them from their likeness to a little skull.)
4. <HI>Serpents eyes</HI> of several figures and colours. The
most of them red and like to those they call <HI>Toad∣stones;</HI>
the exteriour superficies being a segment of
a sphaerical, and shining as if it were polished, so
that they are commonly set in rings. I have seen
great lumps or masses of these cemented together.
That the <HI>Toadstone</HI> is nothing else but the jaw-tooth
of a fish called <HI>Lupus marinus</HI> by <HI>Schonfeldius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Toad∣stone so called is.</NOTE> Dr.
<HI>Merret</HI> in his <HI>Pinax</HI> hath first published to the world;
and I doubt not but these have the same or like ori∣ginal.
5. <HI>Serpents teeth,</HI> which are small, oblong,
striate stones of a polite superficies, but no certain fi∣gure.
Whither to refer these as yet I know not, as
neither 6. Those they call <HI>Serpents eggs,</HI> which
are somewhat like the former but not striate with
lines. 7. <HI>Bastons of S. Paul</HI> [<HI>Baculi S. Pauli</HI>] having
the resemblance of small snagged sticks. 8. <HI>Petrified
Lentils,</HI> because for colour, figure and magnitude
somewhat like to that pulse. Besides, I found among
the stones I bought there some exactly figured like the
fore teeth of a man, and doubtless many other sorts
by diligent search might be found, which have not
as yet been named or taken notice of.</P>
<P>As for Plants I found heer very few sorts but
what I had before observed in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> viz.
<HI>Cucumis asininus; Hypericum tomentosum; Consolida
regalis peregrina parvo flore</HI> J. B. <HI>Carduus lactens pe∣regrinus</HI>
Cam. There are but few trees growing up∣on
the Island, the greatest want they have being of
<PB N="312" REF="169"/>
fewel, to supply which defect they have of late be∣gun
to make use of Sea-wrack to burn in their ovens,
prepared after a certain manner invented by a pesant
of <HI>Malta,</HI> for which he is highly commended by
<HI>Abela</HI> as a great benefactor to his Countrey.</P>
<P>Heer I first noted the custom of slitting up the
notrils of Asses; because they being naturally
streight or small, suffice not to admit air enough to
serve them when they travel or labour hard in these
hot Countreys. For the hotter the Countrey is, the
more air is necessary for respiration and refreshment
of the body; there being less of that <HI>menstruum</HI>
which serves to nourish or continue fire and conse∣quently
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he vital heat of Animals (which hath great
likeness thereto) in hot air then in cold; whence we
see that fire burns furiously in cold weather and but
faintly in hot. Whether it be because the air is thin∣ner
in hot weather and hot Countreys, or because
the reflected Sun-beams spend and consume a good
part of the forementioned <HI>menstruum,</HI> or from both
these causes. That the air is thinner and consequent∣ly
the <HI>menstruum</HI> also more diffused in hot weather is
clear in experience. I need mention no other expe∣riment
to demonstrate it then the air enclosed in the
shank of an ordinary weather-glass, which in hot
weather dilates its self, and in cold contracts very
considerably. So then to give an account of the ra∣ging
of fire in the coldest weather, we need not
have recourse to the insignificant term of <HI>Antiperi∣stasis;</HI>
the true reason thereof being the density of
the ambient and contiguous air containing plenty of
that <HI>menstruum</HI> which nourishes the fire.</P>
<P>I omitted to mention the ancient <HI>Coemeteria,</HI> or
subterraneous burying-places called <HI>Catacumbe,</HI> of
which there be many in <HI>Malta,</HI> because of these we
have already had occasion to discourse in our descri∣ption
of <HI>Syracuse</HI> in <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>That this Island produces or nourishes no Serpent
<PB N="313" REF="169"/>
or other venemous creature, the common people af∣firm;
but because I find no mention heerof in <HI>Abela,</HI>
I give little credit to their report: should it be true, it
would be to me a great argument that this was not
the Island upon which St. <HI>Paul</HI> was cast when he suf∣fered
Shipwrack, but rather that <HI>Melita</HI> before men∣tioned
upon the Coast of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> for which there
is also some ground in the Scripture, which saith
<HI>Acts</HI> 27. 26.</P>
<P>For that St. <HI>Paul</HI> upon the Vipers fastning on his
hand did by his Prayers obtain of God, that all the
Serpents in <HI>Malta</HI> should be turned into stones, and
the Island for the future wholly free from all vene∣mous
beasts, is a Monkish fancy, grounded upon
the forementioned petrified fish-bones, which they
fondly imagined were sometime parts of Serpents:
whereas in other places where plenty of such stones
are found there is no lack of Serpents. I confess it is
difficult to imagine how Serpents should come at first
to breed heer, if the whole Island were once (as we
conceive) a submarine Rock covered with the Sea;
and there be no spontaneous generation of animals,
as wel also believe: because it can scarce be imagined
that any man should on purpose bring over Serpents
hither; unless perchance to shew them for a curio∣sity.
Whether there be venemous beasts or no I am
sure there are venemous insects heer, the very biting
ox stinging of the Gnats (with which the City is
much infested) being more virulent then in other
places. For my part I do not remember that in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
the biting of a gnat did ever cause a swelling, or
leave a mark behind it in the skin of my face (though
I know in some it doth) but there it both raised a
swelling, and left a mark behind it that was not out
for a month after. The <HI>Maltese</HI> easily defend them∣selves
from the annoyance and bitings of this insect,
keeping them out of their beds by large linnen cur∣tains
lapping over one another. At first we were
<PB N="314" REF="170"/>
not aware of the trouble these Animals were like to
give us, and left our curtains open.</P>
<P>From <HI>Malta</HI> we returned the same way to <HI>Messina;</HI>
staying a day at <HI>Catania;</HI> where we hired horses and
took a Souldier to guide us up Mount <HI>Aetna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount <HI>Aetna.</HI></NOTE> now
called <HI>Mon-Ghibello.</HI> The top of which at <HI>Catania</HI>
was told us to be 30 miles distant. We ascended for
the most part all along from <HI>Catania,</HI> and we found
the ground rich, and well cultivated, and the Coun∣trey
well inhabited; for the slag and cinders cast out
of the mountain, being in process of time dissol∣ved
by the weather, doth mightily fatten and enrich
the soil. We rode up so high till we came to the con∣servatories
of snow; and seeing the mountain above
us all covered with snow; we did not, nor indeed
could we ascend any higher. The trees heerabout
had at this time scarce put out their leaves. As we
went up we found in one place the ground covered
for a quarter of a mile broad, and 4 or 5 miles in
length, with cinders, which had been thrown forth
by the mountain, and was cartainly the relique of a
huge stream of melted coals, iron, stones and sulphure
poured out in the time of the last eruption, nothing
as yet growing among these stones and cinders. This
mountain hash in former times thrown forth stones
and slag as far as <HI>Catania</HI> it self, as we could mani∣festly
see; but of all the eruptions that ever were I
believe this last which happened [<HI>Anno</HI> 1669.] since
our being there was the greatest and most horrid;
for a full description and exact account wherof I
refer the Reader to <HI>Borellus</HI> his learned Treatise <HI>De
incendiis Aetnae.</HI> This mountain is of a very great
height, and we were told by credible persons, that
one might see it at Sea over the whole Island any way
one came thither. We could clearly discern the top
of it as far as the Island of <HI>Malta,</HI> which in a right
line must needs be at least 100 miles distant. One
thing we could not but wonder at, that there should
<PB N="315" REF="170"/>
be a ring of snow about the top of <HI>Aetnas,</HI> but the
highest top it self bare, without any snow upon it.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Sicily</HI> are noted for churlish
and uncivil to Strangers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observa∣tions a∣bout the Inhabi∣tants and Customs of <HI>Sicily.</HI></NOTE> and I think not undeser∣vedly.
The <HI>Italians</HI> have a Proverb, <HI>Omnes insulani
mali, Siciliani autem pessimi.</HI> All Islanders are bad,
but the <HI>Sicilians</HI> worst of all. This Island is confes∣sedly
a very ill place to travel in, by reason of the
Robbers and <HI>Banditi</HI> wherewith it is infested, thanks
to the good Government, which takes no more care
to cleanse it of such vermine. These Bandits will not
be content with your money, but will also seize your
person and detain you prisoner in the mountains till
you give them a good ransom for your deliverance.</P>
<P>We took notice of some Laws and Customs pro∣per
to <HI>Sicily</HI> during our stay heer.</P>
<P>1. It is unlawful to carry out of this Island in
money more then ten crowns a person; if any one
carries out more and be taken, all is forfeited. But
the searchers are not so strict, but that if you give
them a little money they will let you pass, especially

<P>After our return to <HI>Messina, May</HI> 27. we
passed by boat over the <HI>Fretum</HI> to see <HI>Rhegio</HI> or
<HI>Rhezo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rhegium, now Rhe∣zo.</NOTE> anciently <HI>Regium,</HI> an old City, but now Ve∣ry
mean and poor. All they have to boast of at pre∣sent
is their Gardens well stored with all sorts of the
best fruits; their Silk, of which plenty is made heer
and (if we may believe themselves) the best in <HI>Italy</HI>
or <HI>sicily:</HI> And S. <HI>Pauls.</HI> pillar which burned, of
which they have but a small fragment remaining.
They told us many stories and legends of it, which
we gave little heed to.</P>
<P>We took boat and went as far as <HI>Scylla,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">May 29. The man∣ner of catching the Sword∣fish.</NOTE> to see the
fishing of the <HI>Pesce Spada</HI> or Sword-fish. The maner
whereof is thus. On the top of the Cliffs by the
Sea-side stand <HI>Speculatores (Huers</HI> our Fisher-men
call them) to espy the Fish, who so soon as they see
them, either by voice if they be near, or by known
signs if at distance, give notice to the Fishing-boats
whereabouts the fish are. The boat presently makes
towards the place; then one gets up to the top of a
little mast in the boat, made with steps on purpose,
and there stands to observe the motion of the fish and
direct the rowers, who accordingly ply their oars.
When they are come very near him, he upon the
mast comes down, and taking the harping iron in
his hand, if he can strikes it into him. The fish be∣ing
wounded, plays up and down and wearies him∣self,
and when he is faint and spent they draw him
up into the boat: This is much like the Whale-fish∣ing.
The harping iron is put on a staff or pole of
wood. The point of it is sharp and hath beards on
each side like a barbed arrow, so joynted that if you
hold the point upward they clap close to the shaft, if
downward they fall off from it on each side, so that
they resist not the going in of the iron but only the
<PB N="317" REF="171"/>
drawing out. This fish is held a great dainty by
the <HI>Messanese,</HI> as much longed for and as greedily
bought up by them as <HI>Soland</HI> goose by the <HI>Scots;</HI>
sold in <HI>Messina</HI> at first coming in for six pence <HI>English</HI>
the pound. In <HI>May</HI> and beginning of <HI>June</HI> it is
taken on the coast of <HI>Calabria;</HI> about the latter end
of <HI>June</HI> it comes over to the <HI>Sicilian</HI> side and is ta∣ken
about the <HI>Faro</HI> till <HI>August.</HI> There because there
be no rocks or cliffs hanging over the Sea, they pre∣pare
a large boat or brigandine, and pitch up in it a
tall mast with shrowds like the mast of a ship, on the
top of which the <HI>Speculator</HI> or Huer stands.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>June</HI> yearly is celebrated at
<HI>Messina</HI> a great Festival called The Feast of our Lady
of the Letter: it continues near a weeks time with
great solemnity. During this time all the house∣keepers
hang out in all the streets a multitude of
lamps, candles, and tapers, and set their windows as
full of lights in paper-lanthorns as they can hold,
which burn all night, so that the streets are as light∣some
almost by night as by day. Nay the light was
so great, that at a good distance from the Town as
we came thither late at night, the reflection thereof
from the clouds and atmosphere appeared to us like
the <HI>Aurora</HI> or <HI>Crepuseulum,</HI> though we saw not the
lights themselves, and it was no dark night, the
moon as I remember shining. They call it the Feast
of our Lady of the Letter, because it is held in me∣mory
of a Letter written to them (as they say) by
the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> which how sorry and ungrounded
a fiction it is the pretended Letter it self (of which
also they confess themselves not to have the Greek
original, but only a Latine copy) will best demon∣strate
to any not grosly stupid Reader. It runs thus,

<P>We returned back from <HI>Naples</HI> to <HI>Ligorn</HI> by wa∣ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE>
baulking <HI>Rome</HI> for the present, being deterred
from going thither by the general vogue in <HI>Italy,</HI>
that in the Summer months, and till the rains fall, it
<PB N="321" REF="173"/>
is very dangerous for him that is in <HI>Rome</HI> to go out
thence, or him that is out to enter in there. The first
night we reacht no further then <HI>Nisita,</HI> a little Island
in the mouth of the bay of <HI>Pozzuolo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> about 5 miles
distant from <HI>Naples.</HI> The second day we proceeded
as far as <HI>Sperlonga,</HI> a little short of <HI>Terracina</HI> ancient∣ly
<HI>Anxur,</HI> about 60 miles. The third day we passed
by <HI>Monte Circello</HI> or the <HI>Promontorium Circeium,</HI> where
the famous enchantress <HI>Circe</HI> is reported to have
dwelt. This Promontory stands out a great way in∣to
the Sea, so that at a distance we took it for an
Island. As we were just over against the utmost point
of it, we observed a great number of insects very
like to <HI>Cicadae</HI> and which we have not elsewhere seen,
flying about in the air. Our boatmen called them
<HI>Gronge.</HI> Divers of them we caught in our boat; and
yet we were at least two leagues distant from land.
Possibly they might fly out a great way further to Sea;
for what reason we cannot easily imagine; perhaps
only to sport themselves in the Sun. Howbeit we
do not remember to have seen any other land-insect
fallying out so far from land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cicada.</NOTE> And now that we have
made mention of the <HI>Cicada,</HI> it may not be amiss by
the way to take notice of a common error commit∣ted
in our <HI>English</HI> Schools in translating or rendring
this word <HI>Cicada</HI> in <HI>English</HI> by <HI>Grashopper,</HI> whereas
a <HI>Cicada</HI> is a much different insect, of a rounder and
shorter body, that sits commonly upon trees, and
makes a noise five times louder then a <HI>Grashopper,</HI>
whose true name in <HI>Latine</HI> is <HI>Locusta,</HI> and not <HI>Cicada.</HI>
Of these <HI>Cicadae</HI> there are great numbers in the hot
Countreys, but none on this side then <HI>Alps</HI> and <HI>Sevenes.</HI>
This night we lodged at <HI>Astura,</HI> where yet remain
some ruines of an ancient Town and the foundati∣ons
of some buildings in the water.</P>
<P>Not far hence the fourth day we passed the new
Town of <HI>Antio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antium.</NOTE> and about a mile distant great ruines
of the old Town, and of a great mole for the Ha∣ven;
<PB N="322" REF="174"/>
and this night lodged at a little tower called
S. <HI>Michael</HI> near the mouth of the River <HI>Tiber</HI> not far
from <HI>Ostia.</HI></P>
<P>The 5th. day we hed a favourable gale of wind,
which brought us to a little place called S. <HI>Stefano,</HI>
not far from <HI>Orbetello.</HI> This day we passed in sight
of <HI>Civita Vecehia</HI> and <HI>Porto Hercole,</HI> compassing
<HI>Monte Argentaro.</HI></P>
<P>The 6th. day there happened a great <HI>Borasco</HI> (as
they term it) that is a storm of thunder, lightning
and rain accompanied with a violent wind, which
continued all the sorenoon; in the afternoon we
rowed about 18 or 20 miles, and put in to a little
Cove or harbour under a tower called <HI>Calo di Furno.</HI>
On the Sea-shore heerabout we found those <HI>opercula
concharum,</HI> which some naturalists make to be stones
and call <HI>Vmbilici marini.</HI> The <HI>Italians</HI> call them S.
<HI>Lucies eyes.</HI></P>
<P>The 7th. day we proceeded as far as the Island
<HI>Troia,</HI> when the wind being contrary we were for∣ced
to take up at a little harbour under the shelter of
a small tower called <HI>Lo Molino.</HI></P>
<P>The 8th. day we passed <HI>Piombino,</HI> a walled Town
which hath a Prince of its own, <HI>Populonia P. Bar∣reto,</HI>
S. <HI>Vincentio, Castagneto,</HI> and <HI>Vada,</HI> and lodged
at a tower called <HI>Castiglione.</HI></P>
<P>The 9th. day it having blown hard all night, not∣withstanding
there was no wind stirring in the mor∣ning,
we found the Sea very rough, yet through the
good providence of God we got safe into <HI>Ligorn</HI>
about noon.</P>
<P>The Plants we took more especial notice of in

<HEAD>OF
FLORENCE.</HEAD>
<P>FRom <HI>Ligorn</HI> we travelled through <HI>Pisa</HI> to <HI>Flo∣rence,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Florence.</NOTE>
a City which answers its name and epi∣thete
<HI>Fiorenza la bella, Florence the fair.</HI> Yet for
beauty in my opinion it must give place to <HI>Antwerp</HI>
and some other Cities in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> only it
excells them in multitude of large stone-palaces,
scattered up and down the streets, sch as are those
of the <HI>Grand Duke</HI> both the old and the new called
the <HI>Palazzo de Pitti,</HI> because purchased of them;
of the <HI>Strozzi,</HI> the <HI>Salviati, &amp;c.</HI> Many of the streets
are streight, which adds no little to the beauty of
them. They are all paved with great broad stones,
like <HI>Luca</HI> or <HI>Collen</HI> in <HI>Germany:</HI> yet but narrow as
in many other Towns of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Gallia Narbonensis</HI>
to keep off the scorching beams of the Sun in sum∣mer
time, which reflected from these broad stones
would else make them more than sufficiently hot.
The Paper-windows and they too for the most part
broken and tattered, do very much disgrace the fair
stone-houses. The River <HI>Arno</HI> divides this City into
two parts, which are joyned together by 4 fair stone∣bridges;
one of which, called <HI>Ponte vecchio</HI> or the
old bridge, hath on each side it a row of Gold∣smiths-shops.
All of them, but especially the two
middlemost, are remarkable for the breadth and flat∣ness
of their arches. The circuit of the walls is said
to be 6 <HI>Italian</HI> miles: but therein is comprehended a
great deal of wast ground, [I mean not filled up
with buildings] the gardens and walks of the <HI>Great
Dukes</HI> Palace being at least a mile in compass; besides
<PB N="325" REF="175"/>
on the other side the River are some hundreds of acres
of land taken up in vineyards and gardens belong∣ing
to private persons. The number of Parishes ta∣king
in the 12 Priorates is 44, the number of Inha∣bitants
according to <HI>Schottus</HI> 85000 souls, and I be∣lieve
he exceeds in his account, though some make
them 90000, and other 100000. There are an in∣credible
number of Nunneries: <HI>Schottus</HI> saith 54;
we were told 56, whereas there are but 24 Mona∣steries
of Freres. But that which is most strange is
the multitude of Hospitals and Alms houses, of
which there are said to be 37: one of which, <HI>viz.</HI>
the <HI>Orphanotrophium</HI> maintains 900 persos, and
hath 70000 crowns yearly revenue.</P>
<P>This City is of no great strength, being encom∣passed
only with an old-fashioned wall: but the
<HI>Great Duke</HI> hath 3 Castles or Cittadels in it, I think
rather to bridle then defend it; one on the South∣side,
held by a good Garrison, neatly kept and di∣ligently
watcht, wherein are laid up Arms for 30000
men. Another is a small Fortress in lthe <HI>Gr. Dukes</HI>
garden, to which he may retire in case of any sud∣dain
danger or exigent: heer they say his treasure
or a good part of it is kept. The third we viewed
not.</P>
<P>The Churches in <HI>Florence</HI> though they be not so
richly gilded as some we have seen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Churches in Flo∣rence. The Do∣mo or Cathe∣dral.</NOTE> yet for their Ar∣chitecture
they excel most, especially the <HI>Domo,</HI> or
Church of <HI>S. Maria Florida,</HI> which is some mens
opinion is the compleatest structure that ever was set
upon the earth. The pilasters the support the <HI>nave</HI>
or body of the Church stand at so great a distance,
and are withal so very slender, that they do not ob∣scure
the Isles, but at one view you enjoy the whole
Church. Besides the <HI>Cupola,</HI> though the first and
pattern of all the rest, is the largest and tallest of any
in <HI>Italy,</HI> excepting that of S. <HI>Peters</HI> in <HI>Rome:</HI> under
which is the Quire, of an octagonal figure. The
<PB N="326" REF="176"/>
walls of this Church are crusted over on the out-side
with marble of several colours, cut into small pieces
and variously checquer'd; which though the <HI>Italians</HI>
now despise and count but a toy, yet makes a pretty
gaudy shew. Within this Church beyond the Quire
are 4 inscriptions; one concerns the building to the

<P>in the Church of S. <HI>Laurence</HI> are interred several
of the <HI>Great Dukes</HI> family.<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. <HI>Lau∣rence</HI> his Church. The Chappel of St. <HI>Laurence.</HI></NOTE> And to this Church be∣longs
the famous Chappel of S. <HI>Lorenzo;</HI> built by
the <HI>Great Dukes,</HI> which when finished is like to be for
its bigness the most sumptuous, rich and magnific
structure in the world. This Chappel is of an octa∣gonal
figure, and the roof of it a large <HI>Cupola.</HI> The
inside of it is encrusted over with several sorts of pre∣cious
stones I may call them, for they are all above
the rate of marble, <HI>viz.</HI> Jasper of several kinds and
colours, Agate, <HI>Lapis Lazuli,</HI> Touchstone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all
polisht and respleudent, inlaid and wrought into
<PB N="331" REF="178"/>
various figures. Of this octagon one side is left void
for the high Altar, for which there is a sumptuous
tabernacle preparing, that now stands in the <HI>Great
Dukes</HI> Gallery. The side opposite to the Altar is for
the door. On the rest of the sides are to be placed
Statues and Monuments for such as have been <HI>Great
Dukes.</HI> The first, beginning on the left hand as you
enter in, intended (as we conjectured) for <HI>Alexander</HI>
who was only <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> is not yet made up.
The rest have on the top the names, and underneath
in a nich the Effigies of the <HI>Great Dukes,</HI> some in stone
and some in brass, under that a Coffin or Cushion
with a Ducal Crown lying upon it, and nethermost
an Inscription in this order,

<P>Between the Monuments of Duke and Duke are
the arms of two of the Cities subject to the <HI>Great

Pisa, Florence, Fiesole, Siena, Grossetto, Massa,
Montalce, Suana, Chiusa, Pientia,</HI> all Episcopal Seas:
besides which in <HI>Tuscany</HI> are many considerable
Towns, Castles, and Fortresses.</P>
<P>I shall enlarge no further concerning the Churches,
Towers, Pillars, Fountains, Statues of brass and stone,
<PB N="332" REF="179"/>
and picturés, of which there are a great number in
this City and of excellent workmanship: only I
cannot omit to mention two <HI>Statuae equestres</HI> in
brass, much greater than the life; one of <HI>Cosmus</HI> I,
upon the great Piazza: the other of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> I,
in the Piazza of the <HI>Annunciata,</HI> erected by <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI>
II.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Dukes</HI> Gallery is in the old Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gal∣lery of the Gr. Duke.</NOTE> a
handsome pile of building. Under ground as it were
in Cellars are the Stables: above them fair <HI>Portico's</HI>
or Cloysters to walk in. Above the <HI>Portico's</HI> are shops
for all manner of Artificers to work in for the <HI>Great
Duke.</HI> The uppermost story is the <HI>Gallery</HI> properly
so called; where in an open walk free for any man
to come into stand many ancient and some also mo∣dern
Statues. Round about on each side this walk
hang the pictures of many Princes and other persons,
who have been famous in the world for learning or
valour. Among the rest we noted the Pictures of
<HI>Queen Elizabeth, King James, Oliver Cromwel</HI> and
<HI>Joannes Acutus</HI> before remembred.</P>
<P>The chief Rarities are lockt up in Closets of
which we saw four. The things which in our tran∣sient
view we took more especial notice of were, a
huge terrestrial globe and a <HI>Sphaera armillaris,</HI> bigger
then that. A brancht Candlestick including many
little figures of ivory or white wax appearing
through the transparent Amber: An Engine coun∣terfeiting
a perpetual motion, like those of <HI>Septalius</HI>
at <HI>Milan.</HI> Seveal stone-tables so curiously inlaid
with small pieces of precious stones of divers colours,
as to compose figures of plants, fruits and flowers,
birds, beasts, and insects, so natural and to the life,
that scarce any picture drawn by the hand can excel
them. One of these, the best and richest that we have
any where seen, both for the excellency of the work∣manship,
and costliness of the materials, being set
with many Rubines and Pearl, they valued at 100000
<PB N="333" REF="179"/>
<HI>Florence Scudi,</HI> which is more than so many <HI>English</HI>
crowns, Several rich Cabinets. That of the greatest
value, which they rated at 500000 <HI>Scudi,</HI> was
thick set with Gems of the first magnitude; a pearl
of an enormous greatness, but not perfectly round;
several Topazes almost as big as Walnuts, large Ru∣bines
and Emeralds, besides other stones of inferi∣our
note, studs of Amethyst, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Heer we also saw
the nail pretended to be one continued body, half
iron, half gold, part of the iron having been turned
into gold by one <HI>Thurnhausserus</HI> an Alchymist of <HI>Ba∣sil</HI>
before mentioned. To us it seem'd counterfeit
and not neatly neither, the iron and the gold being
but bunglingly joyned together. A large topaz as
big as a pullets egg. An entire image made of one
<HI>Turchois</HI> stone: Many ancient <HI>Roman</HI> idols of brass;
old <HI>Roamn</HI> lamps found in Sepulchres of several fa∣shions:
A press full of turn'd work of ivory very
fine and subtil: Rhinocerots horns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I omit se∣veral
pictures and statues wherewith the rooms were
adorned, made by the best Masters, and much esteem∣ed
by those that have judgment in such things.</P>
<P>In the Armory we saw several remarkables,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ar∣mory.</NOTE> as the
Armour of many great persons of <HI>Europe,</HI> among
others of <HI>Henry</HI> IV King of <HI>France</HI> and (<HI>harles</HI> V
Emperour: <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s head-piece (as they called
it) It had engraven on it many ancient <HI>Morcsco</HI> cha∣racters:
A suit of <HI>Persian</HI> Armour for a man on
horseback; made of little scales of iron. A Load∣stone
having its poles at the greatest distance I ever
saw any: Several <HI>Indian</HI> Royal Vests, made of Fea∣thers.
Five great Swords such as the Pope uses to
bless on <HI>Christmas</HI> day, and send to Princes. A King
of <HI>China</HI>'s Armour made of Fish-bones, and a wood∣en
Sword. This sure they mistook for an <HI>Indian</HI>
King's, the <HI>Chinese</HI> having of a long time had the
use both of iron and guns: <HI>Japan</HI> Arms and Swords
without point and broad at the top. Divers <HI>Turkish</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="180"/>
scymitars; <HI>Scanderbeg</HI>'s Sword: The hair of a hor∣ses
mane 7 yards in length; the skin of this horse
stuft up, sent by the Duke of <HI>Lorain:</HI> several con∣ceited
guns: Pistols on whose muzzles were screw'd
heads of Halberds, or Pole-axes. Nine Pistol-bar∣rels
so laid on a frame, that by letting down one
cock they were all discharged, making 18 shot, for
each is double charged, and a train of powder leads
from the touch-hole of the middlemost to the touch∣holes
of all the rest in channels made for that pur∣pose.
An Engine made like a hat; with several pi∣stols
in the crown; this they called the <HI>bona notte,</HI>
being to be discharged upon your enemy when you
complement him and bid him good-night: A long
gun and also a pistol whose barrels are of beaten
gold. Several round bucklers, one with <HI>Medusa's</HI>
head painted upon it by <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> an highly
estèemed piece. <HI>Italian</HI> Jocks for suspected wives:
Ancient <HI>Balistae</HI> (as they called them) which are no
other then great Cross-bows. A thong cut out of
the hide of a Buffle, 250 yards long. A press full of
rich prizes of Arms taken from the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Argenteria</HI> or Wardrobe we saw several
presses or Cup-boards [12 in number] full of rich
plate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ar∣genteria</HI> or Ward∣robe.</NOTE> In one all manner of vessels of beaten gold.
In another a sumptuous Altar of the same metal (as
they told us) set with Diamonds and other precious
stones of the highest value. On it was inscribed in
great Capitals (the letters all made up of Rubines)
<HI>Cosmus II, Dei gratia magnus Dux Etruriae ex voto.</HI></P>
<P>In some by-rooms we saw the skin of a <HI>Morsse</HI> or
Sea-horse stuft; the skin of an <HI>Elk</HI> s the skin
and Sceleton of an Elephant, which was shown in
<HI>Florence</HI> some 8 or 10 years ago, and died there.</P>
<P>I might spend many words in describing the <HI>Gr. Dukes</HI>
new Palace, and Gardens stored with great
variety of trees and shrubs valuable for shade, beauty,
fruit or sent; adorned with a multitude of Statues
<PB N="335" REF="180"/>
thick set up and down the walks and knots: plea∣sant
fountains and water-works; stately and delici∣ous
walks both close and open; goodly flowers aud
choice plants. We took notice of Dictamnus Creticus,
Quamoclit Indorum; Tragoriganum; Stramonium
peregrinum <HI>Ger. i. e.</HI> pomo spinoso rotundo; Pisum cor∣datum,
Balsamina cucumerina, Chamaerrhiphes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Heer in an enclosed place were kept two male Ostri∣ches
and one female.</P>
<P>In the Dukes <HI>Theriotrophium</HI> we observed these
sorts of wild beasts, <HI>Lion, Tiger, Leopard, Bear, Wolf,
Porcupine, Wild Boar.</HI> The snout of this was longer
in proportion than that of tame or domestic Swine:
the ears rounder and shorter and of a black colour,
as were also the feet and tail. These wild Swine are
constantly of the same colour, which is a grisly or
iron-grey. Its worth the observation that most wild
Animals keep to the same colour both Beasts and
Birds; but those that are kept tame vary infinitely,
which is (I suppose) to be attributed partly to the va∣riety
of their food, and partly to the highness of
their feeding; to which the difference of the Cli∣mate
and Soil may contribute something. So we see
that upon the <HI>Alps</HI> and other high mountains cover∣ed
for the most part with snow, several animals, as
<HI>Bears, Foxes, Hares, Partridges,</HI> &amp;c. change their na∣tural
colours, and become white, whether by reason
of the coldness of those mountains, or of the con∣stant
intuition of snow.</P>
<P>In <HI>Florence</HI> many of the Palaces are made of great,
rough-hewn stones, not laid smooth, but each pro∣tuberating
above the <HI>supersicies</HI> of the wall: which
fashion of building the <HI>Italians</HI> call <HI>maniera rustica.</HI></P>
<P>This City at present is rather in a decaying than
thriving condition, there having not been (as we
were credibly-informed) a new house built there
these 40 years: the Citizens generally being but
poor. This comes to pass partly by the great decay
<PB N="336" REF="181"/>
of their trade; for whereas formerly they served
<HI>France</HI> with Silks, now the <HI>French</HI> themselves work
them as well or better than they; partly by reason
of the great exactions of the <HI>Great Duke,</HI> who lays
immoderate gabels upon all commodities that are
bought and sold. The greatest Foreign trade they
have at present is with our nation; and that is not
much, we having most of our Silk from <HI>Messina,
Aleppo,</HI> and other places in the <HI>Levant</HI> and working
it at home. This City is well situate in a good air,
only somewhat sharp in winter time; the Inhabi∣tants
are ingenious and quick-witted. It hath bred
more excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects
then any one City in <HI>Italy</HI> besides: and for Scholars
and great wits it may vie with most.</P>
<P>It's the fashion heer for Gentlemen to sell their
own wine by retail. Yet no body goes into the pa∣lace
to drink; but there is a hole made in the Cellar
or Buttery-wall, to give in and take out flasks or
other vessels; and there is a servant attending for the
most part so long as there is wine to sell. At the pa∣lace
gate or wall they usually hang up the hackles of
old flasks to give notice that there is wine to be sold
there.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen think it a disparagement to them
to practise Physic; so that none of them bring up
their children to the study of medicine; but they
think it no disparagement to exercise merchandise;
and for this they have the example of the <HI>Great
Duke</HI> himself, who is the greatest Merchant in <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI>
nay <HI>Leti</HI> saith, That it is reported, he trades
for more then all the Merchants in <HI>Genoa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Great Duke</HI> is both heer and in all his domini∣ons
supreme and absolute Lord, and may <HI>pro arbi∣trio</HI>
impose what taxes and gabels he pleases; and
therein he is not sparing. Every house pays to him
the tenth of its yearly rent. No house or land sold
but a good part of the price (at least one tenth) goes
<PB N="337" REF="181"/>
to him. No woman married but he hath 8 <HI>per cent.</HI>
of her portion. Every one that goes to Law pays
2 <HI>per cent.</HI> of what he fues for. Every young Heifer
that is sold pays a crown; Not so much as a basket
of eggs comes to market but it pays somewhat for
toll. So that his Revenue must needs be great:
some say a million and half, others two millions of
crowns yearly. His expences amount not to one
million; and consequently, considering also the in∣come
of his trading, he must needs have an immense
treasure; by <HI>Leti's</HI> reckoning more then 60 millions
of crowns: but its well if it amounts to half that
sum. And though some at <HI>Florence</HI> would have per∣swaded
us that the world was mistaken in this opini∣on of his great riches, yet we sew good reason to
continue in that belief; he using all ways of thrift
and sparing as well as getting; keeping no house but
allowing his servants board-wages, and being at a
set rate with his Cook, and his Baker, who for the
monopoly of fine bread (<HI>Pane di bocca</HI> they call it)
furnishes his private table, and pays 1000 <HI>Scudi per
annum</HI> besides. Moreover it was a maxime with
him, that a good treasure of mony is the greatest
strength and security of a Prince, and he would
often say of our late King <HI>Charles</HI> I, that want of
money ruined him, and therefore it may well be
presumed himself would take care to fill his Coffers
with that.</P>
<P>Besides the territories of <HI>Florence</HI> and <HI>Pisa,</HI> called
the old State, of which he is absolute Lord and So∣vereign;
and the territory of <HI>Siena,</HI> called the new
State, for which he is feudatary of the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> He is also possessed of part of the isle of <HI>El∣ba,</HI>
which he holds of <HI>Spain,</HI> part of <HI>Graffignana,</HI>
bought of the Marquesses <HI>Malaspina;</HI> the Earl∣dom
of S. <HI>Fiora,</HI> purchased of the <HI>Strozzi;</HI> the
Marquisate of <HI>Scanzano,</HI> and the Earldom of <HI>Pi∣tigliano</HI>
and <HI>Sorano</HI> formerly belonging to the <HI>Vrsini,</HI>
<PB N="338" REF="182"/>
and some other small places, for all which he is feu∣datary
of the Emperour. <HI>Radicofani</HI> in <HI>Tuscany</HI> and
<HI>Borgo san Sepolchro</HI> in <HI>Vmbria,</HI> for which he is feuda∣tary
of the <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>His Citadels and Fortresses, especially those on the
borders, are thought to be the best fortified and pro∣vided
with Ammunition and victual of any in <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI>
for the guard of which he keeps four or five
thousand Souldies in constant pay. The 3 principal
offices of trust are the Governours of <HI>Siena,</HI> of <HI>Li∣gorn</HI>
and <HI>Petigliano.</HI> He hath always about his person
a guard of <HI>German</HI> Souldiers. He is able to send
into the Field 40000 footmen and 3000 horsemen.
<HI>Leti</HI> saith, that he hath 40000 footmen enrolled,
who are obliged to stand ready at every call; and
1000 horsemen listed and divided into 12 Compa∣nies,
and these last have the priviledge not to be
imprisoned for debt. He can also put forth to Sea
upon oceasion 12 gallies, 2 galeasses and 20 ships of
war.</P>
<P>He entertains and diverts the Citizens of <HI>Florence</HI>
in Summer-time with sports and shows, especially
races for prizes (<HI>Pallio's</HI> they call them) sometimes
<HI>Barbary</HI> horses, sometimes ordinary horses running
through one of the streets of the Town (which
thence they call the <HI>Curso)</HI> without any riders. To
make them go they fasten little flaps of leather stuck
with prickles upon their backs.</P>
<P>The Great Duke holds good correspondence and
amity with all Christian Princes and States; except
the Pope [upon account of <HI>Borgo San Sepolchro,</HI> to
which the Pope pretends; the Marquisate of <HI>Monte
feltre,</HI> to which the Duke hath some pretensions in
right of his Wife, who was heiress to the late Duke
of <HI>Vrbin;</HI> and the business of <HI>Castro:</HI>] and the Duke
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> between whom and him there hath been
an ancient emulation about precedency.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="182"/>
The <HI>Duke</HI> hath the nomination of the Bishops and
Governours of all the Cities in his Dominions.</P>
<P>The Ecclesiastical Revenues of the Dukes whole
State, according to a Survey taken in the year 1645,
were found to be 765000 <HI>Scudi</HI> or crowns <HI>per an.</HI>
For this <HI>Leti</HI> is my Author.</P>
<P>The Family of the <HI>Medici</HI> have had two Dukes
besides those of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> viz. <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Ne∣vers</HI>
and <HI>Laurence</HI> Duke of <HI>Vrbin;</HI> two Arch-Du∣chesses
married to them, <HI>viz. Joan</HI> daughter of the
Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> I, wife of <HI>Francis</HI> I; and <HI>Ma∣ry</HI>
daughter of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> II, wife of <HI>Cosmus</HI> II: four
<HI>Popes,</HI> viz. <HI>Leo</HI> X. <HI>Clement</HI> VII, <HI>Pius</HI> IV, and <HI>Leo</HI> XI:
two Queens of <HI>France,</HI> viz <HI>Katharine</HI> wife of <HI>Henry</HI>
II and <HI>Mary</HI> wife of <HI>Henry</HI> IV, mother to our late
Queen-mother, who died in <HI>Collen</HI> 1640. Their
greatness began to exceed the measure of other Fa∣milies
(saith my Author) by the death of Pope <HI>John</HI>
XXIII, deposed in the Council of <HI>Constance</HI> in
the
year 1414, who died in the house of <HI>John Medices,</HI>
and made him his heir.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen and Citizens of quality keep not
their daughters at home after they be 8 or 10 years
of age, but put them into Nunneries, where they
are bred and taught all manner of womens work. Out
thence they come not till they be married. He that
makes love to any of them may with the parents
consent see and speak with them at the grate of the
Nunnery. This is not only a secure but also a cheap
way to bring up their daughters. For they pay not
to the house above 16 pounds a year for diet and
all.</P>

<P>The red <HI>Florence</HI> wine is most commened for a
table wine of any in <HI>Italy;</HI> and doubtless it is most
wholesome, and to them who are used to it also most
gustful and pleasant. It is of a deeper colour than or∣dinary
Claret, which is caused by letting it stand
longer upon the husks or <HI>vinacea</HI> before it be pressed.
For it is the skin only which gives the tincture, the
interiour pulp of the grape being white.</P>
<P>We began our journey to <HI>Rome.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 1.</NOTE> First we passed
through <HI>Castiano</HI> a pretty little Town 8 miles di∣stant
<PB N="341" REF="183"/>
from <HI>Florence;</HI> and when we had proceeded 4
miles further, we left the ordinary road to <HI>Siena</HI> by
<HI>Poggi bonzi,</HI> (which is the plainer but longer) and
rode to S. <HI>Buco,</HI> a good large Village, and from
thence to S. <HI>Donato,</HI> a poor walled Town 16 miles
from <HI>Florence,</HI> and 14 from <HI>Siena.</HI> From S. <HI>Donato</HI>
we rode on to <HI>Castellina di Campi</HI> 5 miles further,
from whence to <HI>Siena</HI> we had 9 miles more; the
first four mountainous and stony way, the last five
good. All this Countrey we rode through, and ge∣nerally
all <HI>Tus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any,</HI> is mountainous and barren. Yet
are not the mountains very high. About 5 miles
from <HI>Florence</HI> we took notice of the <HI>Certosa</HI> or <HI>Car∣thusian</HI>
Cloyster, seated on a pleasant hill by the way
side. We had the prospect of <HI>Siena</HI> about 10 miles
before we came at it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Siena.</NOTE> <HI>Siena</HI> is a fair City, some 4
miles in compass. The Piazza or Market-place is
compassed about with good buildings, and for the
figure of it not unfitly resembled to a cochle or scal∣lop-shell.
This fancy had they who paved it, for on
one side, <HI>viz.</HI> that next the Palace, they have placed
the figure of the heel of a cochle-shell made in stone,
and from thence have drawn rayes or ribs of stone
(answering to the ridges or <HI>striae</HI> of a cochle-shell) to
the edges round. The <HI>Domo</HI> or Cathedral Chruch is
a stately edifice of marble, having a beautiful front;
adorned withinside with the heads of all the Popes,
placed in the wall, round about the body of
the Chruch. Part of this Church is paved with
Marble inlaid, or a more elegant sort of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣saic
work, containing part of the History of the Bi∣ble,
done by <HI>Micherino Sanese.</HI> This pavement is
covered with a moveable floor of boards to preserve
it. Had it been finished as intended, all <HI>Europe</HI> could
not have shown the like; but there is not a fourth
part done. The painting of the Library walls in this
Chruch, containing the History of <HI>Alneas Sylvius</HI>
afterwards <HI>Pope Pius</HI> II, half by the hand of <HI>Petrus
<PB N="342" REF="184"/>
Peruginus,</HI> and half by <HI>Raphael Vrbin,</HI> is in my
judgment the most excellent painting that ever I
beheld, and so fresh and lively as if it had been done
but yesterday. Heer are also other good Churches
and handsome Palaces. We ascended the Tower cal∣led
<HI>Torre di mangio,</HI> from whence we had a fair pro∣spect
of the whole City, which runs out into 3 an∣gles.
The walls enclose much void ground, which
is made use of for Gardens and Vineyards. All the
streets and <HI>Piazza</HI> are paved with brick set edge∣ways,
after the manner of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the sides of
the streets of the <HI>Holland</HI> Towns. The whole Town
is well built and situate upon a hill, and by that
means always clean. They heer make no use of snow
or ice to cool or refresh their Wines, their cellars
keeping it cool enough. In the Palace of the <HI>Podestà</HI>
we saw a room, the walls and roof whereof were
painted by <HI>Micherino Sanese,</HI> valued at more then
the whole Palace besides. We took notice also of
the Theater for Comedies, a fair brick building;
and the <HI>Studium,</HI> called the <HI>Sapienza,</HI> where are
the public Schools, a mean building much like that
of <HI>Pisa.</HI> This City is counted a very good place to
sojourn in for a Stranger that would learn <HI>Italian,</HI>
as well because the Citizens heer speak the purest
language, as for that they are very civil and courte∣ous
to Foreigners. Besides by reason of its situation
the air is temperate even in Summer time; Provi∣sions
also are reasonable.</P>
<P>We travelled to <HI>Radicofani</HI> 34 miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 3.</NOTE> passing
through 1. <HI>Lucignano</HI> a post-village, and in sight of
<HI>Cuna</HI> a Village on a hill; also a little walled Town
called <HI>Fuon-convento,</HI> then <HI>Tornieri</HI> a post-village,
and lastly S. <HI>Quiricho,</HI> i. e. <HI>S. Cyriaci oppidum.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Qui∣richo.</NOTE> Which
so soon as we had passed I found great plenty of La∣vender-cotton,
which grew all along by the way∣side.
There grew also all this days journey in great
plenty <HI>Absinthium Romanum</HI> Caes. Between S. <HI>Qui∣richo</HI>
<PB N="343" REF="184"/>
and <HI>Radicofani Cinara sylv.</HI> and two other spe∣cies

Lob. the other I knew not; <HI>Acarna flore purpuro∣rubente
Patulo; Veronica spicata coerulea; Winter
Savory; After luteus Linariae folio; Colchicum</HI> cover∣ed
all the pastures. Between S. <HI>Quiricho</HI> and <HI>Radi∣cofani</HI>
we passed no considerable Town or Village.
All the Countrey we rode through this day is moun∣tainous
and barren, very little wood growing on the
ground.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Radico∣fani.</NOTE> <HI>Radicofani</HI> being a frontier is strongly for∣tified
and held with a Garrison of 300 Souldiers by
the Great Duke. This <HI>Radicofani</HI> is situate upon a
high hill, so that one may see it going or coming 12
or 14 miles.</P>
<P>We travelled from <HI>Radicofani</HI> to <HI>Viterbo</HI> 38 miles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 4.</NOTE>
About 10 miles from <HI>Radicofani</HI> we passed over a
small River called at a place called
<HI>Ponte Argentino,</HI> which divides the State of the <HI>Gr.
Duke</HI> and of the <HI>Pope.</HI> It is to be noted that in all
this Countrey the Towns and Villages are generally
set upon the tops of hills, for coolness I suppose.
We observed also that the Countrey subject to the
Great Duke, at least that part we travelled this Voy∣age,
was craggy and bare of trees, and seem'd to
us to be but dry parcht and barren land. But so soon
as we came into the <HI>Ecclesiastical State</HI> the world
was well amended; for the hills were for the most
part covered with trees, and the valleys very fruit∣ful.
Fourteen miles from <HI>Radicofani</HI> we passed <HI>Aqua∣pendente</HI>
a large old Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aqua∣pendente.</NOTE> <HI>ex re nomen habens,</HI> for
it stands upon the brow of a hill from which the
water falls perpendicularly. Then we passed S. <HI>Lo∣renzo,</HI>
a little Town on the edge of the lake of <HI>Vol∣sinii</HI>
now called <HI>Bolsena,</HI> and rode along the brink of
the lake 5 miles to <HI>Bolsena.</HI> From <HI>Bolse</HI> we mounted
up to <HI>Monte Fiascone,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monte Fiascone. Vilerbo.</NOTE> where we tasted the so much
celebrated wine, and after 8 miles further riding over
a spacious and fruitful plain arrived at <HI>Viterbo,</HI> a large
<PB N="344" REF="185"/>
and well situate Town, but not very fairly built. All
that we took notice of there was 2 or 3 handsome
Fountains, and the monument of Pope <HI>John</HI> XXI in
the <HI>Domo.</HI> There are Sulphure-wells and hot springs
about the Town, but we had not time to examine or
so much as view them.</P>
<P><HI>We rode to</HI> Baccano 22 <HI>miles from</HI> Viterbo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 5.</NOTE> <HI>passing
through</HI> Ronciglione <HI>a pretty Town belonging to the
State of</HI> Castro. <HI>In the woods we travelled through

<P>We travelled from <HI>Baccano</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI> 16 miles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE>
From a mountain we passed over not far from <HI>Bac∣cano</HI>
we had a wide prospect of the <HI>Campania</HI> of
<HI>Rome,</HI> which being covered over with a thick mist,
appeared to us (looking down upon it from the clear
sky above) like a huge lake of water, nor could we
have perswaded our selves otherwise had we not be∣fore
observed the like <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> in some places of
<HI>England.</HI> About 3 miles short of <HI>Rome</HI> we passed by
an ancient monument like to those we had observed
at <HI>Modena,</HI> which they call the Sepulchre of <HI>Nero;</HI>
and somewhat more than a mile before we entred the
City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ponte Molle.</NOTE> we passed over the <HI>Tiber</HI> by the <HI>Ponte Molle,</HI>

<P>OF <HI>Rome</HI> both ancient and modern, though
more might be said than of any City in the
world, yet because so much hath been written by
others both in <HI>Latine</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> I shall be very
brief, it being needless to trouble the world with
what hath been already published in other books.</P>
<P><HI>The most remarkable Antiquities to be seen in</HI>
Rome <HI>are some ruines and remainders of</HI> Heathenish
Temples, Theatres and Amphitheatres, Circi, Baths,

Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solaea, Statues, Altar stones, Grave-stones and other
stones with inscriptions, Medals, Entaglie or Gems en∣graven
with figures, sacrificing vessels and instruments,
Sepulchral urns, Lachrymal urns, ancient Lamps,

<P>First for ancient Temples the most remarkable
that I observed yet remaining,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ancient Temples.</NOTE> either entire or some
parts or ruines of were</P>
<P>1. The <HI>Pantheon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Pan∣theon <HI>or</HI> Rotonda.</NOTE> now dedicated to the Virgin
<HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>All-Saints,</HI> and commonly called the <HI>Ro∣tunda</HI>
from its figure. Its highth was 144 feet, and
its breadth as much. The roof was vaulted in form
of a <HI>cupola,</HI> and all the light it received was by
a large round hole of 3 yards diameter just in
the top. It had a porch of 16 tall and massive
pillars of speckled marble called Oriental granite;
each pillar being of one entire stone; of which
there are at present only 13 remaining. Upon the
Architrave of the Portico is inscribed in large letters.

<P>This Temple was covered with copper-plates or
tiles, taken away by Pope <HI>Vrban</HI> VIII; whence
that Pasquinate, <HI>Quod non fecere barbari fecere Bar∣berini.</HI>
He thereupon (as was thought) to silence and
appease the clamour of the people, caused thereof to
be made the 4 famous wreathed pillars and Canopy
of the high Altar in S. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church. Of the very
nails [<HI>clavi trabales</HI>] which fastned the tiles of the
<HI>Portico</HI> was cast a great gun of the weight of 2800
pounds now to be seen in Castle S. <HI>Angelo</HI> with the
figure of one of the nails, and an inscription upon
it signifying whereof it was made, <HI>viz. Ex clavis
trabalibus Porticus Agrippae.</HI> This Temple remains
still entire, only despoiled of its ancient statues and
ornaments. For heer besides many others was that
famous <HI>Minerva</HI> of <HI>Phidias.</HI> When it was first built
it had an ascent of 7 steps which encompassed it
round, now you descend 11 steps to go into it: so
much is the rubbish and earth grown up above it.
Indeed a great part of old <HI>Rome</HI> lies buried under
ground in its ruines. One remarkable thing in this
Temple they bade us take notice of, which I find
not in books, that is, that the lintel and side-posts of
<PB N="348" REF="187"/>
the great door of this Church (which is of a huge
highth and breadth for a door) are all of one entire
stone; which we were content to believe rather than
put our selves to the trouble of examining. In this
Church is the monument of <HI>Raphael Vrbin,</HI> whose
Epitaph (he being so eminent a person and one that
carried on painting to its highest perfection) I shall
heer insert.</P>

<P>2. <HI>Templum Fortunae virilis,</HI> according to some;
according to others <HI>Templum Lunae,</HI> but more pro∣bably
of the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Jupiter.</HI> It stands by the River
side not far from the broken bridge; is now called
S. <HI>Maria Aegyptiaca,</HI> and therein the <HI>Armenians</HI>
have their service.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Templum Solis;</HI> according to some <HI>Templum
Vestae;</HI> and to others <HI>Templum Herculis Victoris.</HI> It
stands near the precedent, and is now called <HI>La Ma∣donna
del Sole,</HI> or <HI>S. Stefano allc carrozze.</HI> It is but
small, of a round figure, having a <HI>portico</HI> or gallery
of striate pillars round about it. The Walls are of
stone, and it hath no windows, but receives all its
light from a round hole in the top, like the <HI>Rotonda.</HI>
This and the former remain still almost entire.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Templum Dianae Aventinae,</HI> now the Church of
<PB N="349" REF="187"/>
S. <HI>Sabino.</HI> It is large; the walls of brick and the
<HI>nave</HI> divided from the Isles by 12 striate pillars on
each side.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Templum Herculis Aventini;</HI> now the Church
of S. <HI>Alexius</HI> and <HI>Bonifacius;</HI> situate on the top of
the <HI>Aventine</HI> mount, not far from the former.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Templum Jani quadrifrontis,</HI> in the Cow-mar∣ket.
This seems rather to have been an Arch than a
Temple.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Templum Concordiae,</HI> at the foot of <HI>Mons Capi∣tolinus,</HI>
of which there remains only the <HI>portico,</HI> he∣ving
eight great pillars of marble, most of them of
one stone.</P>
<P>8. <HI>Templum Saturni,</HI> anciently the treasury, now
S. <HI>Adrian</HI>'s Church: at the foot of the Capital, near
<HI>Severus</HI> his Arch. The frontispiece of this Church is
a remainder of the old Temple.</P>
<P>9. <HI>Templum Antonini &amp; Faustinae;</HI> now S. <HI>Loren∣zo
in Miranda.</HI> The portico of this remains <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> en∣tire
with its ancient inscription, and a great part of
the walls made of massy square stones. The marble
pillars of the porch suffer much by the weather, be∣ing
of that sort of stone, which hath a grain lying
one way, and so riving or cleaving like wood.</P>
<P>10. <HI>Templum Romuli &amp; Remi,</HI> now of S. <HI>Cosmo
&amp; Damiano;</HI> little of the old Temple remaining:
the stones it seems being carried away by <HI>Ignatius
Loyola</HI> for his foundation. There is a concurrent
Echo, in a <HI>cupola</HI> you pass under to go into the body
of this Church.</P>
<P>11. <HI>Templum Isidis &amp; Scrapidis sive Solis &amp; Lunae,</HI>
now S. <HI>Maria nuova,</HI> near <HI>Titus</HI> his arch. The pre∣sent
Church is no part of the old Temple, nor built
exactly upon the place where it stood: but behind
the Cloyster are some part of the ruines of the old
Temple still remaining.</P>
<P>12. <HI>Templum Pacis.</HI> This was the largest of all
the ancient Temples in <HI>Rome,</HI> built by <HI>Vespasian.</HI>
<PB N="350" REF="188"/>
There are yet standing part of 3 vaults or arches;
and the plant of the whole may easily be discerned.
The great striate pillar set up before the Church of S.
<HI>Maria maggiore</HI> was taken hence, and was one of
eight which supported the nave or body of this
Temple. It is the greatest pillar of one entire stone
now remaining in <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>13. <HI>Templum Jovis Statoris.</HI> Of this the 3 pillars
remaining in the <HI>Campo vaccino</HI> near the <HI>Palatine</HI>
mountain are supposed to have been part.</P>
<P>14. <HI>Templum Jovis tonantis.</HI> Of this the 3 pillars
almost buried in the earth, on the architrave
whereof are these letters ESTITUER, standing on
the left hand the <HI>clivus</HI> as you go up from <HI>Severus</HI>
his arch to the Capitol are supposed to have been
part.</P>
<P>15. <HI>Templum Fauni,</HI> now S. <HI>Stefano rotundo,</HI> a
large round fabric, having two circles of pillars
con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ical; the outermost of lesser pillars; the
innermost of larger: in the outermost are 44 pillars,
in the inner the just half of that number. Besides
the pillars of the inner circle stand exactly at the
same distance one from another as do those of the
outer.</P>
<P>16. <HI>Templum Herculis Callaici,</HI> now <HI>Galluzzo.</HI> It
stands in the vineyards near <HI>S. Bibiana;</HI> a very tall
building of brick not exactly round but decagonal.
The roof of it is a vault or <HI>cupola</HI> not so great as
that of the <HI>Rotonda</HI> and yet not much less. It had
two doors diametrically opposite, and in the other
sides were 8 niches for statues.</P>
<P>17. <HI>Templum Bacchi extra portam Piam,</HI> one mile
without the City walls: now the Church of S. <HI>Co∣stanza.</HI>
This also is a round structure. The walls
are of brick and of a great thickness: within it hath
a lesser round or concentrical circle of 12 large pil∣lars
There stands an ancient monument of Por∣phyry
of the fashion of a huge chest or trough, ha∣ving
<PB N="351" REF="188"/>
a stone to cover it. This is curiously engraven
with several figures of branches of trees, boys tread∣ing
of grapes, of birds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They call it the monu∣ment
of <HI>Bacchus.</HI> In several places of the roof are
to be seen very fresh the pictures of bunches of grapes
and several things belonging to the vintage. The
freshness of the colours and rudeness of the figures
makes me doubt whether this was ancient <HI>Roman</HI>
painting or no.</P>
<P>18. <HI>Templum Solis.</HI> Of this there was lately a
piece standing in the Garden of the <HI>Columnae</HI> upon
<HI>monte cavallo,</HI> called <HI>Frontispicium Neronis</HI> and <HI>Torre∣di
Nerone</HI> by the vulgar. It is now quite thrown
down; only there remain in the Garden vast marble
stones, the greatest that ever I saw, and some of
them curiously carved which came from the top of
this building.</P>
<P>19. <HI>Templum Romuli &amp; Remi sub monte Palatino,</HI>
now dedicated to S. <HI>Theodore.</HI> This is a round brick
building, into which you descend by many steps as
into the <HI>Rotonda.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, For <HI>Amphitheaters</HI> and <HI>Theaters</HI> there are <MILESTONE N="2"/>
yet remaining great ruines of the Amphitheater of
<HI>Titus</HI> now called the <HI>Coliseo,</HI> round without, and of
an oval figure within; capable of 85000 men to sit
and see. There are also some footsteps of the Am∣phitheater
of <HI>Statilius Taurus,</HI> near to the Church
of S. <HI>Croce in Gierusalemme;</HI> and lastly a good part
of the walls of the Theatre of <HI>Marcellus,</HI> upon which
the <HI>Savelli's</HI> Palace is built.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Of <HI>Circi</HI> there is 1. a good part of that <MILESTONE N="3"/>
of <HI>Antoninus Caracalla,</HI> a mile out of the City. 2. Of
the <HI>Circus maximus</HI> there is little remaining, only
the fashion of it may be plainly discerned. 3. The
<HI>Circus Agonalis</HI> stood where now is the <HI>Piazza Na∣vova.</HI>
4. Of the Circus of <HI>Nero</HI> in <HI>Campo Vaticano</HI> no∣thing
remains now to be seen; as neither of 5. the
<HI>Circus Flaminius.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="189"/>
Fourthly, For Baths there are great ruines of
those of 1. <HI>Diocletian,</HI> wherein there were seats for
3200 persons to bathe themselves without seeing or
hindering one another; in the building of which he is
said to have employed 40000 Christians for 15 years
together. 2. <HI>Antoninus Caracalla,</HI> in which were
1600 seats or closets of polished marble. These were
those <HI>Thermae in modum Provinciarum extructae.</HI> Be∣sides
there are some ruines remaining of 3. The
<HI>Thermae</HI> of <HI>Titus.</HI> 4. Of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> near the <HI>Rotonda,</HI>
called <HI>Ciambella.</HI> 5. Of <HI>Constantine</HI> near S. <HI>Sylvesters.</HI>
6. Of <HI>Nero</HI> near the Church of S. <HI>Eustachius.</HI> 7. Of
<HI>Paulus Aemilius</HI> at the foot of <HI>Monte cavallo,</HI> called
<HI>Magnanapoli.</HI> Many others there were anciently of
which now scarce any foot-steps to be seen.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Of Aquaeducts the Author of <HI>Roma an∣tica
&amp; moderna</HI> mentions 4, of which something re∣mains,

It is engraven on each side with 3 rows of Hiero∣glyphics.</P>
<P>2. That in the Piazza before Saint <HI>Peter</HI>'s
Church, the only one that still remains intire and
unbroken. It was taken out of the <HI>Circus</HI> of <HI>Cali∣gula</HI>
and <HI>Nero,</HI> and set up by <HI>Dominicus Fontana,</HI> by
the other, and at the charge of Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> V, as
were also those of <HI>S. Maria maggiore</HI> and <HI>S. Job.
Lateran</HI> This obelisk hath no Hieroglyphics upon
it, is 72 foot high besides the pedestal, in all 108,
said to weigh (according to <HI>Lassels</HI>) 956148 pounds.
Of the manner of taking up and rearing this stone,
and the engines employed about it, there is a particu∣lar
book written. The 4 modern Inscriptions on the
4 faces of the pedestal, and the ancient one on the
obelisk it self may be seen in <HI>Roma antica &amp; moderna.</HI></P>
<P>3. That of S. <HI>Joan. Lateran</HI> having 3 rows or
files of Hieroglyphics on each side it. This is the
greatest of all the obelisks in <HI>Rome,</HI> being 112 foot
long besides the base, an at the base 9 1/2 feet thick
one way and 8 foot the other. Who brought it to
<HI>Rome</HI> and where it was set up, this Inscription upon
it will acquaint the Reader.</P>

<P>It was broken into several pieces but is well men∣ded
and set together again, and the wanting Hiero∣glyphics
supplied.</P>
<P>4. That of S. <HI>Maria maggiore,</HI> lesser then any of
the forementioned, having on it no hieroglyphics.
It was taken out of the <HI>Mausoleum</HI> of <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>5. That of the <HI>Piazza Navona,</HI> erected by Pope
<HI>Innocent</HI> X. It was taken out of the <HI>Circus</HI> of <HI>Cara∣calla,</HI>
is the least of all the forementioned by much,
having but one row of hieroglyphics. Of this
<HI>Athan. Kircher</HI> hath written a book in <HI>folio,</HI> which he
calls <HI>Obeliscus Pamphylius,</HI> from the Popes name to
whom he dedicates it.</P>
<P>6. That of S. <HI>Mahuto</HI> fast by the Jesuites Church.
It seems to be but a small piece of the top of an obe∣lisk
broken off; it is engraven with hieroglyphics,
and set up negligently on 4 rude stones.</P>
<P>7. That in the Garden of the <HI>Medici:</HI> it is full
of hieroglyphics, and set upon a base without any
inscription. It is but a small thing, and seems to have
been only the top of a broken one.</P>
<P>8. That in the Garden of the <HI>Mattei,</HI> given them
by the Senate and people of <HI>Rome.</HI> This also is a
small one, and broken in two pieces, whereof the
uppermost hath toward the top some hieroglyphics,
the lower piece hath none.</P>
<P>9. In the Court of the Palace of the Prince of
<HI>Paloestrina</HI> of the family of the <HI>Barberini</HI> lieth an obe∣lisk
broken in 3 pieces, engraven with hieroglyphics,
which its like was longer.</P>
<P>10. <HI>Roma antica</HI> mentions another standing at
<PB N="356" REF="191"/>
the foot of the stairs in the Palace of the <HI>Vrsini</HI> in the
<HI>Campo di fiore:</HI> but this we saw not.</P>
<P>11. We were told of an obelisk lying in the <HI>Cam∣pus
Martius</HI> under a row of houses, as big if not big∣ger
then any of those already erected, and supposed
to continue intire and unbroken.</P>
<P>These obelisks, all that are engraven with hiero∣glyphics,
are of one and the same kind of stone, <HI>viz.</HI>
a marble of a mingled colour red and white, which
some call very hard, and which
hath not in so many ages suffered the least by the
weather. As for the figure of them they are made
taper-wise, lessening from the basis to the <HI>vertex</HI> by
little and little, so that indeed they are not much
unlike a spit, from whence they took their name.
Yet are they not continued till they terminate in a
point; but when they are become too small to en∣grave
more hieroglyphics upon, the tops are cut into
the form of an obtuse pyramid. It is said, and I think
truly, that the hieroglyphics engraven upon these
obelisks are from the bottom to the top greater and
greater by degrees; so that the lowermost and the
rest all along to the uppermost appear to the specta∣tor
of equal bigness.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7"/> Seventhly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trium∣phal Ar∣ches.</NOTE> Of <HI>triumphal Arches</HI> there are yet re∣maining

<P><MILESTONE N="8"/> Eighthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pillars.</NOTE> Of pillars beside such as belonged to
temples there are 4 remaining. 1. The <HI>Columna mil∣liaria,</HI>
<PB N="357" REF="191"/>
which stood in the <HI>Forum Romanum,</HI> as it
were in the center of the City, from whence they
began to reckon the distance from <HI>Rome</HI> to all parts.
This pillar is marked toward the top with this nu∣meral
letter I, of a great bigness, signifying one or
the first stone, and upon every public way at a miles
end was set up a second stone marked II, and so in
order at every miles end a stone marked with the
number of the miles of its distance from <HI>Rome:</HI> So
that <HI>ad secundum lapidem</HI> signified at one miles di∣stance
from this pillar; <HI>ad tertium</HI> two, and so on.</P>
<P>This pillar is not considerable for its greatness but
only for the use of it, and the ancient inscriptions
upon it. It is now set up on one side of the <HI>Area</HI> of
the <HI>Capitol.</HI></P>
<P>2. The <HI>Columna rostrata,</HI> erected in the <HI>Forum
Romanum</HI> to <HI>C. Duilius,</HI> who obtained a victory
over the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> in a Sea-fight. There is upon
it a long inscription in old <HI>Latine,</HI> full of <HI>lacunae,</HI>
and hardly intelligible; which as it is supplied and
made out may be seen in <HI>Roma antica.</HI></P>
<P>3. The <HI>Columna Trajana</HI> or pillar of <HI>Trajan</HI> of
white marble, still standing ever since its first erecti∣on.
It is 128 foot high beside the base, which is of
12 feet. Within it is hollow and hath a pair of win∣ding
stairs of 192 steps, whereby one may ascend to
the top, and there are in it 44 little windows to give
light. It is made up of 24 stones, and every stone
hath in it 8 steps. On it are carved in an <HI>helical area,</HI>
compassing the pillar after the manner of a screw
from top to bottom, the exploits and atchievements
of <HI>Trajan</HI> in his <HI>Dacic</HI> expedition, &amp;c. The pede∣stel
of this pillar was all buried under ground, and
not to be seen, till they dug about it and laid it open
by the order of Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the III. Upon it are in∣scribed
these words.</P>

<P>4. The pillar of <HI>Antoninus,</HI> much like the former,
175 foot high, ascended by 206 steps and having 56
little windows. This pillar was broken and miser∣ably
defaced; but by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> V mended and re∣stored
to its pristine form. Vide <HI>Roma antica.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="9"/> Ninthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mauso∣laea.</NOTE> Of <HI>Mausolaea,</HI> there are only that of
<HI>Augustus</HI> and the <HI>moles</HI> of <HI>Adrian,</HI> now called Castle
<HI>S. Angela.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/> Tenthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statues.</NOTE> Of <HI>Statues</HI> there are an infinite number in
the palaces and gardens about Town, both ancient
and modern: I believe more then in all <HI>Europe</HI> be∣sides.
Some of the most famous and esteemed are,
the <HI>Equestris Statua</HI> in brass of <HI>M. Aurelius Antoninus
Pius,</HI> now standing in the <HI>area</HI> of the Capitol. The
statues of the two horses with men by them in stone,
now standing upon the <HI>Mous Quirinalis</HI> which is
thence called <HI>Monte Cavallo.</HI> The statues of <HI>Laocoon,</HI>
the trunk of <HI>Hercules,</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> in the Popes

<P>Of Altar-stones, grave-stones and other stones <MILESTONE N="11"/>
with inscriptions there is great plenty in all quarters
of the City.</P>
<P>Of ancient <HI>Medals</HI> and <HI>Entaglie</HI> there are daily <MILESTONE N="12"/>
digged up store;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ancient Medals and <HI>Enta∣glie.</HI></NOTE> and no wonder it is, this having
been the seat of the Empire so long. They are to
be sold in many shops, and I have frequently seen
of them lying upon the stalls in the market-places.
Divers also of the <HI>Virtuosi</HI> have collected whole series
of imperial medals.</P>
<P>Of sepulchral urns of several fashions and magni∣tudes,<MILESTONE N="13"/>
some made of earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sepul∣chral urns.</NOTE> some of stone, there are
abundance to be seen in the <HI>ville,</HI> gardens and pala∣ces

<HI>Virtuosi.</HI></P>
<P>As for sacrificing vessels and instruments, lachry∣mal <MILESTONE N="14"/>
urns, ancient lamps, rings, <HI>fibulae,</HI> and other im∣plements,
<HI>tesserae hospitalitatis,</HI> weights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> several
antiquaries there are in town, who have likewise
made collections of them; as <HI>Leonardus Augustinus</HI>
the then Popes Antiquary, and <HI>John Petro Bellori,</HI>
a very ingenious person and skilful in Antiquities,
who shew'd us a great number of these things and
very well conserved. That worthy and ingenious
Gentleman Cavalier <HI>Carlo Antonio dal Pozzo</HI> shew'd
us some 20 volumes in folio, wherein were the fi∣gures
of most of the Antiquities in and about <HI>Rome,</HI>
drawn exactly by the hand. In one of these were
all the vessels and instruments used about sacrificing.
In others of them we noted the <HI>Crepundia antiqua,</HI>
which were little images made of earth like children,
hares, apes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> found in urns. The <HI>Sistrum</HI> of Ca∣valier
<HI>Gualdi</HI> figured in <HI>Roma Antica:</HI> Ancient <HI>Sta∣terae;</HI>
ancient weights. Of these ancient weights we
<PB N="360" REF="193"/>
saw in the <HI>museum</HI> of <HI>Leonardus Augustinus</HI> some
made of a dark red stone handsomely polished, of
the figure of Holland cheeses, and of several mag∣nitudes,
marked on one side with the number of
ounces or pounds which they weighed. Of these
weights I have seen two in the Church of S. <HI>Maria in
Cosmedin,</HI> called <HI>Schola Graeca,</HI> and two in the
Church of <HI>S. Maria in Trastevere</HI> of the bigness of
good large Holland cheeses, which they have a tra∣dition
and have inscribed on the wall where they
were hung up, that they were stones that the
heathens hung at the feet of Christian Martyrs when
they suffered, to stretch and torment them. A medal
with the figure of a <HI>talus</HI> on one side and on the
other this inscription, <HI>Qui ludit arrham det quod satis
sit</HI> The ancient <HI>Fritillus</HI> or dice-box, like those now
in use. The ancient <HI>Strigiles:</HI> A medal of that sort
that was used to be hung about slaves necks, having
on the one side the figure of the wolf with <HI>Romulus</HI>
and <HI>Remus</HI> hanging at her paps; on the other in 3
concentrical circles these words, <HI>Tene me nè fugiam
&amp; revoca me in foro Trajani purpuretica ad Pascasium
Dominum meum.</HI> A drinking glass made like a <HI>Priapus,</HI>
which explains that of the Poet, <HI>Vitreo bibit ille Pri∣apo.</HI>
The ancient timbrel, like those we have seen
used now a days. It is made in fashion of a sieve, the
bottom of it on which they strike, of vellum, the
rim of wood, having several long holes or crannies
in it, wherein are hung round pieces of brass like
great medals upon their centers; besides there is a
string cross the instrument hung full of bells.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> is a large City, but seemed to us not so po∣pulous
as either <HI>Venice, Milan</HI> or <HI>Naples:</HI> they reckon
the number of inhabitants to be about 120000 souls
besides strangers, of which there are a great num∣ber
always heer. The extent of the walls is greater
than of any City in <HI>Europe, viz.</HI> 13 miles; but they
take in a great deal of wast ground. The City is now
<PB N="361" REF="193"/>
crept down from the hills (upon which the chief of
it formerly stood) into a valley by the rivers side sur∣rounded
with hills. It is generally well built; many
of the streets straight and adorned with a great num∣ber
of stately palaces scattered up and down all over
the town; full of Monasteries and Churches, of
which they say of all sorts there are above 300. It is
well served with all provisions for the belly: yet are
not things generally so cheap there as either at <HI>Naples</HI>
or <HI>Florence.</HI> Their beef (as I intimated before) is ve∣ry
good, not much inferiour to ours in <HI>England.</HI> Be∣fore
they kill their beasts they put them in a great
heat and chafe, for the same reason I suppose that we
hunt Deer and bait Bulls in <HI>England, viz.</HI> to make
the flesh eat more tender and short, which yet spoils
the colour of the meat, and in some mens judgment
the taste too, disposing it to putrefaction. Their suck∣ing
veal, which they call <HI>vitella mungana,</HI> they ima∣gine
all <HI>Europe</HI> cannot parallel for goodness and deli∣cacy.
Their kid or <HI>Caprette</HI> is also accounted very
good meat; and so is their Swines-flesh. Their Mut∣ton
is the least commendable, as being for the most
part tough and dry. Tame fowl they have as good
and savory as in any place, <HI>v. g. Hens, Capons, Tur∣keys,
tame Pigeons.</HI> Geese are seldom heer to be sold▪
Plenty also there is of wild foul of the best sorts, and
cheap enough, as Partridge of two kinds, the com∣mon
and red legg'd Partridge, Wood-cocks, Snipes,
Duck and Mallard, Wigeon, Teal, Gray, green and
bastard Plover, Curlews, Quails. Of small birds
the greatest plenty that I have any where seen, as
Thrushes in winter time an incredible number, Black∣birds
store, Larks infinite. One would think that in
a short time they should destroy all the birds of these
kinds in the Countrey. For besides that you never
fail of great numbers of them in all the Poulterers
shops, there is every afternoon a market of small
birds wherein they are sold by the Countrey people.
<PB N="362" REF="194"/>
Besides the forementioned there are sometimes to be
sold <HI>Cranes, wild Geese, Shell-drakes, Avosettae, Water
Hens, Berganders</HI> and several other sorts of wild fowl.
I have seen lying frequently in the Poulterers shops,
and therefore I presume some people eat them, such
Birds as in <HI>England</HI> no man touches, <HI>viz.</HI> Kites, Buz∣zards,
Spar-hawks, Kestrels, Jayes, Magpies and
Wood-peckers. Nothing more commonly sold and
eaten heer and in all <HI>Italy,</HI> than Coots and Stares.
They spare not the least and most innocent birds,
which we account scarce worth the dressing, much
less powder and shot, <HI>v. g.</HI> Robin-red-breasts, Fin∣ches
of all kinds, Titmise, Wagtails, Wrens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>No want of fish either of fresh or salt water,
though it be sold commonly dearer than flesh, as be∣ing
brought a great way. Scarce any fish to be found
any where on the coast of <HI>Italy</HI> but some time or
other it may be met withal heer. Those that are the
most frequent in the markets are, of River or Fresh-water
fish, Pike, Carp, Tench, Trout, Eel, Barble,
Chevin, Dace. I do not remember that I ever saw a
Perch to be sold in <HI>Rome.</HI> Of Sea-fish, <HI>Mullus antiquo∣rum,</HI>
which they call <HI>Triglia,</HI> of which they have a
Proverb, <HI>La Triglia non mangia chi la piglia.</HI> He
that takes the <HI>Triglia</HI> eats it not. This fish the French
call <HI>Rouge</HI> from its colour; and we in <HI>Cornwal</HI>
(where I have seen of them taken) <HI>Surmullet. Spie∣gole,</HI>
in Latine <HI>Lupus marinus,</HI> of which kind I have
not seen any in <HI>England; Orate,</HI> Giltheads; <HI>Cephali,</HI>
which we in English call <HI>Mullet,</HI> the ancients cal∣led
it <HI>Mugil;</HI> Sarde, a kind of Sprat; Conger;
Lamprey; Sole; Plaise and others of the flat kind;
Merluzzos, which we call Hake; sometimes small
sturgeons; Dog-fish of several sorts; Tuny and
Sword-fish is also to be sold heer.</P>
<P>Wild Boar and venison of wild Deer you shall sel∣dom
fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of, to be sold in the Poulterers shops. Their
wild Deer they call <HI>Capreole,</HI> it is for the most part
<PB N="363" REF="194"/>
very lean▪ Porcupine also is sometimes to be sold in
the markets.</P>
<P>Oranges and Lemons are cheap in <HI>Rome;</HI> Pears
and Apples, if they be good and large fruit, dear, they
sell them by weight heer, as they do generally all over
<HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Their bread is very good and light notwithstand∣ing
they use no yeast to raise it, and cheaper than
ours in <HI>England.</HI> And heer by the way it may not
be amiss to take notice, that the use of yeast for the
raising and fermenting of bread in these Northern
Countries hath been very ancient. I find mention
of it in <HI>Pliny, lib.</HI> 18. <HI>cap.</HI> 6. who thereupon gives
their bread the preeminence for lightness. <HI>Gal∣liae,</HI>
saith he, <HI>&amp; Hispaniae frumento in potum resoluto,
quibus diximus generibus, spumâ itâ concretâ pro fer∣mento
utuntur. Quâ de causâ levior illis quàm caeteris
panis est.</HI></P>
<P>Heer is great variety of Wines: more sorts com∣monly
sold than in any other City of <HI>Italy:</HI> as
<HI>Greco, Lagrime</HI> or <HI>Naples, Languedoc</HI> wine, wine
of <HI>Syragusa</HI> and <HI>Augusta</HI> in <HI>Sicily, Orvietano, Jensano,
Monte Pulciano, di Monte fiascone, Castelii, Romano,</HI>
and which is most commonly drunk, <HI>Albano.</HI> Most
of the wines are sweet and full-bodied, and will
bear half water. Sweet wines they call <HI>abboccati</HI> and
rough wines <HI>asciuti.</HI> They have little wine so harsh
and rough upon the palate as our <HI>French</HI> Claret and
<HI>Florence</HI> red wine, though those also are to be had
heer. Their Olives are small, but good and sweet.
They have plenty of Wall-nuts and Hazel-nuts,
and other fruits the same that we have. For Ap∣ples
and Pears no Countrey hath better, I had
almost said so good as we in <HI>England.</HI> For Apri∣cocks
I tasted none beyond the Seas comparable to
ours.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> is noted for several commodities and ma∣nufactures,
as Viol and Lute-strings the best in <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI>
<PB N="364" REF="195"/>
perfumed gloves; combs made of Buffles
horns, womens fans, Vitriol, Essences.</P>
<P>Commonly all strangers that travel thither buy of
those things not for their use only, but to make pre∣sents
of to their friends.</P>
<P>Heer is doubtless the best music in the world, es∣pecially
voices, there being many Eunuchs and
Nuns, a great part of whose employment it is to

<P>For pictures of the best masters <HI>Rome</HI> excells all
places, there being more heer than I think in all
<HI>Italy</HI> besides, so that <HI>Rome</HI> is become the school of
Painters, who come from all parts of <HI>Europe</HI> hither

statues and other ornaments, especially their great∣ness
(some being in compass 3 or 4 miles) excel the
orchards, gardens and walks of any Prince in Chri∣stendom
that I have seen. Of these there are a great
number, but the chief of all are 1. The <HI>Villa Bor∣ghese,</HI>
of which family was Pope <HI>Paul</HI> V. This is
esteemed the best of all the <HI>villae</HI> and gardens about
<HI>Rome,</HI> though it be not so vast as 2. the <HI>villa Pam∣phylia,</HI>
of which family was Pope innocent X. This
is on the <HI>Janiculum</HI> without S. <HI>Pancras</HI>'s gate and is
said to be 4 miles in compass. 3. The <HI>Villa Ludo∣visia</HI>
belonging to the Prince <HI>Ludovisio;</HI> of which
family was <HI>Gregory</HI> XV. 4. The Popes garden at
the Vatican called <HI>Belvedere.</HI> 5. The Popes garden
at <HI>monte cavallo.</HI> 6. The garden of the Grand Duke
<PB N="365" REF="195"/>
or the <HI>villa de Medici.</HI> 7. The garden of <HI>Montaltō.</HI>
8. The garden of the <HI>Mattei.</HI> In all which there are
little palaces furnished and adorned with excellent
statues, <HI>bassi rilievi,</HI> pictures and other curiosities,
which I forbear to enumerate and describe at large,
that I may not spend time, and waste paper in wri∣ting
what few will think worth their while or pains
to read; and which hath already been published by
Mr. <HI>Lassels</HI> in his <HI>voyage</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> to which I refer
the curious for further satisfaction.</P>
<P>Of the palaces and public buildings I shall say
nothing, only I cannot forbear a word or two of S.
<HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Church,</HI> which is in my opinion the most
stately, sumptuous and magnificent structure that
now doth, or perhaps ever did stand upon the face
of the earth. This was the only building that sur∣prised
me and exceeded my expectation, being for
a work of man the most pleasant and goodly, not to
say ravishing object that ever I beheld. The whole
pile of that majestic bulk and greatness that it ex∣ceeds
in all dimensions the most famous Temples
mentioned by the ancients: being in length 520 foot
(as Mr. <HI>Lassels</HI> tells us) and 385 in breadth: and in
some, the greatest Christian Churches; for though it
be not so long as S. <HI>Pauls London,</HI> yet is it much
broader, and in that respect much handsomer; the
breadth being more proportionate to the length.
The <HI>cupola</HI> of that marvellous highth and compass
(the diameter thereof be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng equal to that of the
<HI>Pantheon</HI>) and sustaining on the top a huge stone∣lanthorn,
with great pillars of stone about it, that
it may well be accounted the boldest piece of Archi∣tecture
(as he saith) that I think the world hath seen.
The Roof arched or vaulted, and the vault divided
into great squares or panes like wainscot after the
old <HI>Roman</HI> fashion; the ribs and transverse borders
which terminate those squares or pannels being chan∣nelled
and richly gilded, and the <HI>area</HI> of each square
<PB N="366" REF="196"/>
almost fill'd up with a gilt rose. The oval Portico
encompassing a large <HI>area</HI> before the Church, consist∣ing
of 4 rows of great stone pillars standing so thick
that they show like a grove of great trees: The
stately porch to which you ascend out of this <HI>area</HI>
by 24 steps; not to mention the incrustation of some
part of the walls with polished marble; the excel∣lent
statues, stately Altars, rare pictures and other
ornaments, render this Church truly admirable,
and in all respects I will not say comparable to but
excelling the best in the world.</P>
<P>During our stay at <HI>Rome</HI> we rode forth to see 1.
<HI>Frescati 12 Italian</HI> miles distant, anciently called
<HI>Tusculum,</HI> where <HI>Cicero</HI> had a <HI>villa</HI> or Countrey∣house,
of which as yet they shew some remains.
Heer are at present 3 noted ville, 1. That of the
<HI>Borghesi</HI> with the palace called <HI>Mondragone,</HI> and two
others. 2. The <HI>Villa Aldobrandina</HI> or <HI>Belvedere</HI> be∣longing
to Prince <HI>Pamphylio.</HI> 3. The <HI>Villa Ludovisia;</HI>
all of them for walks, groves, Labyrinths, gardens
and other ornaments not inferiour to the best about
<HI>Rome,</HI> and for cascates or falls of water, wetting
sports and other ingenious water-works, beyond
them. What we took more especial notice of, as ha∣ving
not before seen, was the imitation of a tempest
or storm of thunder and rain. This artificial thun∣der
they call <HI>Girandola.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Tivoli,</HI> anciently <HI>Tibur,</HI> 18 Italian miles off
<HI>Rome.</HI> Of this City <HI>Horace</HI> was much enamoured,
praying that it might be the seat and retirement of
his old age. <HI>Tibur Argeo positum colono, Sit meae sedes
utinam senectae, Sit modus lasso maris &amp; viarum mili∣tiaeque.</HI>
It stands like <HI>Frescati</HI> on the brow of a hill
and overlooks the Campagna of <HI>Rome.</HI> Heer are
some remains of ancient temples and other build∣ings,
and a remarkable cascate of the river <HI>Aniene</HI>
or <HI>Teverone.</HI> The villa of <HI>Este</HI> for gardens and or∣chards,
walks and groves, the <HI>Girandola</HI> and other
<PB N="367" REF="196"/>
water works is nothing inferiour to those at <HI>Frescati.</HI>
About 5 miles distant from <HI>Tivoli</HI> we passed over the
Sulphur-river, the water whereof is warm, of a
blewish colour and noisom smell, much like to that
of the Sulphur-well at <HI>Knareburgh</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire.</HI> It
encrusts the channel it runs in with a whitish kind of
friable stone, which in many places in the bottom
and sides of the channel congeals in the figure of
confects or sugar-plums which they call <HI>Confetti de
Tivoli.</HI> Of these you have boxes full to be sold at
<HI>Rome,</HI> so exactly resembling confects both for fi∣gure
and colour that no man can distinguish them;
but they are not naturally found so figured, as they
would make strangers believe, but artificially made
so by casting in moulds. About <HI>Frescati</HI> we found
great store of <HI>Styrax arbor</HI> growing wild in the hed∣ges,
which we found no where else beyond the Seas.</P>
<P>The Campagna of <HI>Rome</HI> seems to be good land,
but is esteemed a very bad air and unhealthful Coun∣trey
to live in, which is the reason it is so desolate
and thin of inhabitants.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot one natural Phaenomenon we
observed at <HI>Rome,</HI> which did a little surprise us. In
sharp <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rosty weather in the middle of Winter, the
water which the servants brought up to wash with
in the morning was hot to that excess that we did
verily believe they had heated it over the fire; nor
could we be perswaded of the contrary till we went
down to the fountain, and found it there of equal
temper with what was brought up. It was formerly
taken for granted by the Peripatetic Schools, that
fountains of springing water are hotter in cold wea∣ther
or winter and colder in hot or summer than at
other times; the reason whereof they assigned to be
an <HI>Antiperistasis,</HI> satisfying themselves with that,
and seeking no further. Later Philosophers who
could not content themselves with the notion of <HI>An∣tiperistasis,</HI>
chose rather to deny the truth of the ex∣periment,
<PB N="368" REF="197"/>
and affirmed that fountain-water was not
really warmest in the coldest weather, or coldest in
the hottest, but only seemed so to our sence; the
temper of which is much altered according to the
difference of the weather: So that what is much
colder than our temper in hot weather, is not much
colder in cold weather, and so seems not so cold,
and on the contrary. Or thus, We judging of the
heat and cold of other things by the proportion they
bear to the temper of the air about us, when the air
is very cold, though the water hath the same degree
of cold it had before, yet it may be hotter then the
air, and consequently seem to us actually hot, and
<HI>vice versa.</HI> But for my part whatever the reason be, I
must needs assert the truth of the experiment, being
very confident that the water, at least of some sour∣ces,
doth not only seem to be but really is much hot∣ter
in cold frosty weather than at other times; else
this water could not possibly have seemed to us, as
it did, more than luke-warm.</P>
<P>Great store of rain falls heer in winter time to
make amends for the extraordinary heat and
drought of the summer.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> is a place not only well worth the seeing, but
very convenient to sojourn in, there being where∣withal
to entertain and divert men of all sorts of hu∣mors
and tempers.</P>
<P>The present <HI>Romans</HI> seemed to me in their houses
and furniture, particularly their beds and lodging,
in their diet, in their manners and customs and in
their very pronunciation (so liquid, plain and di∣stinct)
more to symbolize and agree with us <HI>English</HI>
then any other people of <HI>Italy,</HI> whether it were that
we learned of them or they of us or both mutually
of each other, when there was that great commerce
and entercourse between us and that City for so ma∣ny
years together.</P>
<P>To describe at large the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> with all
<PB N="369" REF="197"/>
its Officers and Ministers; the Ecclesiastical govern∣ment
of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church in general; their Cere∣monies
and shows; the civil government of the ter∣ritories
subject to the Pope and particularly of the
City of <HI>Rome;</HI> the interest of the Pope and the terms
he stands in with other Princes, would require a vo∣lume
alone; and therefore I shall chuse rather whol∣ly
to omit those particulars for the present, and pass
on to the description of our succeeding voyage.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 24. 1664. We departed from <HI>Rome</HI> and
began our journey to <HI>Venice;</HI> riding along the <HI>Via
Flaminia,</HI> and passing the <HI>Tiber</HI> again by the <HI>Ponte
Molle</HI> or <HI>Pons Milvius.</HI> At 7 miles distance from <HI>Rome</HI>
we passed a small village called <HI>Prima porta.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prima Parta.</NOTE> Some
suppose that anciently the City extended thus far:
which conjecture I conceive is grounded upon the
name of this place. Eight miles further riding
brought us to a small town called <HI>Castel novo,</HI> where
we lodged. All this afternoon we rode near the <HI>Ti∣ber,</HI>
upon the <HI>Via Flaminia,</HI> which reaches as far as
<HI>Rimini.</HI> It is paved with broad flints, and pebbles,
and hath on each side a border of stone, and in that
border at every second or third pace a stone standing
up higher than the level of the border. We obser∣ved
in the fields we passed through this day great
store of vernal <HI>crocuses</HI> now in flower.</P>
<P>We proceeded on to <HI>Arignano</HI> or <HI>Ariano,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">25. Ariano.</NOTE> a little
town and a post-stage 8 miles. Heer we left the <HI>Via
Flaminia,</HI> and rode round a high hill (which stands
single,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civita Castella∣na.</NOTE> and may be seen 20 miles forward) to <HI>Civita
Castellana</HI> a little town standing on a hill and a post-stage,
9 miles. Not far from hence we had the pro∣spect
of <HI>Caprarola</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI>'s Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capraro∣la.</NOTE>
[where we were told is a whispering room like that
in the Palace of <HI>Te</HI> at-<HI>Mantua]</HI> which seemed not
to be more than two or three miles distant in a right
line, but we were assured that as the way lay it was
ten or twelve miles thither.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="198"/>
Four miles further we came to a poor small town
called <HI>Borgetto;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Borghetto</NOTE> a little below which we passed the
<HI>Tiber</HI> by a bridge called <HI>Ponte Felice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ponte Felice.</NOTE> begun by <HI>Sixtus</HI>
V and finished by <HI>Vrban</HI> VIII, for the benefit of
Travellers and Pilgrims, as appears by an inscripti∣on
upon it. Not far from the river on our right hand
we passed under a little town, standing on the top
of a hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maglia∣no.</NOTE> called <HI>Magliano,</HI> and rode on about 6
miles near the bank of the river, (having in prospect
at a good distance on our left hand a town called
<HI>Horta)</HI> till we came to <HI>Vtricoli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Horta.</NOTE> which town at pre∣sent
stands upon a hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vtricoli.</NOTE> but by the ruines that re∣main,
the ancient <HI>Ocricoli</HI> seems to have lain near
the river, at least part of it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Vtricoli</HI> we had stony way over the moun∣tains
for five miles. For about a mile before we en∣tred
<HI>Narni</HI> we rode upon the brink of a horrid pre∣cipice
by the river <HI>Nera's</HI> side.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Narni.</NOTE> <HI>Narni</HI> anciently called
<HI>Nequinum,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Narnia</HI> from the river <HI>Nar</HI>
which runs beneath that steep rocky mountain upon
the ridge whereof this City stands, was formerly a
<HI>Roman</HI> colony and a place of some account, but is
now very mean, poor, and inconsiderable. <HI>Leander
Albertus</HI> saith it was ruined and left almost quite de∣solate
by the <HI>Venetian</HI> Souldiers who were quartered
there in the time that the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> V be∣sieged
Pope <HI>Clement</HI> VII in the Castle S. <HI>Angelo. Gatta∣melata</HI>
the famous Captain for the <HI>Venetians,</HI> to
whom they have erected a brass statue on horseback
near S. <HI>Antonies</HI> Church in the City of <HI>Padua,</HI> was
native of this town. Near <HI>Narni</HI> are seen the re∣mainders
of vast arches of stone, which some say
were of a bridge, others more probably of an Aque∣duct,
over the river from one mountain to another.</P>
<P>We rode from <HI>Narni</HI> over a pleasant and fruitful
valley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE> encompassed with mountains, and cultiva∣ted
after the manner of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> to <HI>Terni,</HI> anciently
<HI>Interamna</HI> from its situation, a handsome little City,
<PB N="371" REF="198"/>
having a pretty piazza, on which stands a Church
that seems to have been an ancient temple. About 4
miles from this town is that famous Cascate or fall
of water from the lake <HI>di Pie di Luco.</HI> At the fur∣ther
end of this valley beyond <HI>Terni</HI> and upon the
hills were the greatest olive-yards or rather forests of
huge olive-trees that I have any where seen in <HI>Italy,</HI>
and at this time of the year we found the people ve∣ry
busie in brushing down and gathering of olives.</P>
<P>From <HI>Terni</HI> we had mountainous way to a little
place called <HI>Tritura,</HI> another Post-stage, and from
thence we descended to <HI>Spoleto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spoleto.</NOTE> the chief town of
<HI>Vmbria</HI> thence called <HI>Ducato Spoletano.</HI> The walls
of this City are of a large extent, and the houses in∣differently
fair, and there are to be seen many ruines
of ancient buildings in it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Spoleto</HI> we rode through a very pleasant and
fruitfull valley of a great extent, surrounded with
mountains, much resembling the <HI>Arena</HI> of an Amphi∣theater,
planted with rows of trees and vines after the
manner of <HI>Lombardy.</HI> The hills round about yield
a pleasant prospect, being sprinkled every where
with little towns and houses set thick upon them.
About 4 miles short of <HI>Foligno</HI> we rode under an
indifferent great town, standing on a round hill,
called <HI>Trevi.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trevi.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Foligno [Fulginium]</HI> is a pleasant and handsome
little town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foligno.</NOTE> noted for confections and sweet-meats.
At the end of the valley of <HI>Spoleto</HI> beyond <HI>Fuligno</HI>
we observed the like woods of olive-trees as in the
valley of <HI>Terni.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Foligno</HI> we ascended again in a way cut
out of the side of a mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 27.</NOTE> having on our left
hand a huge precipice, and below a valley between
very high and steep hills, into which at the upper
end falls down a little river called <HI>Dale,</HI> which drives
some paper-mills; a pleasant place to behold. About
4 or 5 miles from <HI>Foligno</HI> we got up to the top of the
<PB N="372" REF="199"/>
<HI>Apponnine,</HI> where the mountains all about us were co∣vered
with snow. On the top of these mountains is
a little plain, and upon it a small lake or pool
of water, and a village called <HI>Col fiorito,</HI> a very
pleasant place in Summer-time, as its name
imports. When we had passed over this plain we
began again to descend, and the next considerable
village we came to was <HI>Serravalle, ex re nomen habens,</HI>
it being situate in the jaws of a narrow valley, 14
miles distant from <HI>Foligno.</HI> From <HI>Serravalle</HI> we rode
among the mountains by the side of a little river,
passing several small villages, <HI>viz. La Muccia</HI> or <HI>Mu∣tia</HI>
and <HI>Pulverina,</HI> &amp;c. and lodged at <HI>Valcimarra.</HI></P>
<P>We rode through <HI>Tolentino</HI> a pretty little town,
having a handsome piazza,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28. Tolenti∣ne.</NOTE> distant 9 miles from <HI>Val∣cimarra.</HI>
This was the Birth-place of <HI>Franciscus Phi∣lelphus</HI>
a learned man, and a great Critic in the
<HI>Greek</HI> tongue. He it was that invented the word
<HI>stapes</HI> for a stirrop, which before had no name in
<HI>Latine.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Macera∣ta.</NOTE> From <HI>Tolentino</HI> we had 10 miles to <HI>Mace∣rata,</HI>
a large, well-built and populous town, having
a handsome piazza. It is the Capital city of <HI>Marca
Anconitana,</HI> where the Cardinal-Legate or gover∣nour
of the Province usually resides. From <HI>Maccrata</HI>
we rode to <HI>Loreto</HI> passing through <HI>Recanati,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Recana∣ti.</NOTE> in La∣tine
<HI>Ricinetum,</HI> a very pretty town, situate on the
ridge of a hill, and but 3 miles short of <HI>Loreto.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Loreto</NOTE> It
arose from the ruines of <HI>Helvia Ricina,</HI> destroyed by
the <HI>Goths.</HI> Heer we took notice of a table with a
brass statue of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> in <HI>basso relievo</HI> upon it,
and an inscription, giving thanks to her that she was
pleased to fix her house in the territory of this City.</P>
<P><HI>Loreto</HI> stands likewise upon a hill, a pretty small
place, consisting only of one little street within the
walls, and a Burgo or Suburb without likewise of
one street, as big as the City within. The Church
and College of the Canons stands at one end of the
street. Before the Church is a little piazza having a
<PB N="373" REF="199"/>
cloyster or Portico on one side where the Canons
lodgings are. In the midst of this piazza is a hand∣some
fountain, and before the Church door a brass
statue of <HI>Sixtus</HI> V in a sitting posture, with an in∣scription
signifying that he had advanced <HI>Loreto</HI> to
the dignity of a city, giving it a Bishop. The doors
of the Church are of brass cast and graven with
several histories. The Church is built like our Ca∣thedrals
in form of a Cross, having a <HI>Cupola</HI> in the
middle, directly under which stands the <HI>Santa Casa</HI>
or holy house (as they call it) enclosed in a case of
white <HI>Parian</HI> marble, curiously engraven with seve∣ral
figures in b. r. representing several histories, by
the best sculptors then living. The house it self is
sufficiently described in the history of it written by
<HI>Tursellinus.</HI> The walls (which are now only remain∣ing,
the roof being removed) are made of a kind of
red stone (as they would have us believe) not only of
the colour but also of the figure of bricks, indeed
so like bricks that I can hardly perswade my self they
were any other. This kind of stone, they say, at
this present is found about <HI>Nazareth</HI> and no where
else, which if true is one of the best arguments they
have to prove that this house came from thence. That
the Reader may see what weak proofs and little
evidence they have of the miraculous transporation
of this house from <HI>Judea</HI> hither, I shall heer insert
the whole Relation of it made by themselves, which
is translated into 13 several languages and hung up
in tables heer in the Church: and in <HI>English</HI> runs
thus,

<HEAD>The miraculous Origin and Translation of the Church
of our Lady of Loretto.</HEAD>
<P>The Church of <HI>Loreto</HI> was a Chamber of the
B. Virgin nigh <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in which she was born and
<PB N="374" REF="200"/>
bred, and saluted by the Angel, and therein concei∣ved
and brought up her Son <HI>Jesus</HI> to the age of 12
years. This chamber after the Ascension of our Savi∣our
was by the Apostles consecrated into a Church
in honour of the B. Lady: and S. <HI>Luke</HI> made a pi∣cture
to her, likewise extant therein to be seen at
this very day. It was frequented with great devotion
by the people of the Countrey where it stood whilst
they were Catholics. But when leaving the Faith of
Christ they followed the Sect of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the An∣gels
took it and carried it into <HI>Sclavonia</HI> and placed
it by a town called <HI>Flumen,</HI> where not being had in
due reverence, they again transported it over the
Sea to a wood in the territory of <HI>Recanati,</HI> belong∣ing
to a Noble woman called <HI>Loretta,</HI> from whence
it took the name of our Lady of <HI>Loreto;</HI> and thence
again they carried it, by reason of the many robbe∣ries
committed, to a mountain of two brothers in
the said territory: and from thence finally, in re∣spect
of their disagreement about the gifts and offer∣ings,
to the common high-way not far distant,
where it now remains without foundations, famous
for many signs, graces and miracles; whereat the
inhabitants of <HI>Recanati,</HI> who often came to see it,
much wondering, environed it with a strong and
and thick wall, yet could no man tell whence it
came originally, till in the year 1296. the B. V. ap∣peared
in sleep to a holy devout man, to whom she
revealed it, and he divulged it to others of Autho∣rity
in this Province, who determining forthwith to
try the truth of the vision, resolved to chuse xvi
men of credit, who to that effect should go all to∣gether
to the City of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> as they did, carrying
with them the measures of this Church, and com∣paring
therewith the foundatious remnant, they
found them wholly agreeable; and in a wall there
by engraven, that it stood there, and had left the
place. Which done they presently returning back,
<PB N="375" REF="200"/>
published the premisses to be true: and from that
time forward it hath been certainly known, that this
Church was the Chamber of the Virgin <HI>Mary:</HI> to
which Christians began then, and have ever since had
great: devotion, for that in it daily she hath done and
doth many and many miracles. One <HI>Frere Paul de
Sylva</HI> an Eremite of great sanctity, who lived in a
cotage nigh unto this Church, whither daily he
went to Mattins, said that for ten years space on
the 8th. of <HI>September,</HI> two hours before day he saw
a light descend from heaven upon it, which he said
was the B. V. who there shewed her self on the Feast
of her Nativity. In confirmation of all which two
virtuous men of the city of <HI>Recanati</HI> divers times
declared unto the Prefect of <HI>Terreman</HI> and Gover∣nour
of the forementioned Church is followeth,
The one called <HI>Paul Renalduci</HI> avouched, that his
Grandfather saw when the Angels brought it over
the Sea, placed it in the forementioned wood, and
had often visited it there: the other called <HI>Francis
Prior</HI> in like sort affirmed, that his Grandfathers
Grandfather, being 120 years old, had also much
frequented it in the same place, and for further proof
that it had been there, he reported that his Grand∣fathers
Grandfather had a house nigh unto it, where∣in
he dwelt; and that in his time it was carried by
the Angels from thence to the mountain of the two
Brothers, where they placed it as abovesaid.</P>

by the way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fano.</NOTE> passing over two long bridges. <HI>Fano,</HI> an∣ciently
<HI>Fanum Fortunae,</HI> is a much larger city then I

an old triumphal Arch erected to <HI>Augustus,</HI> which

<P>Heer we saw the ancient temple of <HI>Fortuno</HI> now
the Augustine Freres Church: And the brass statue
of Fortune which was adored, taken out thence,
now standing in the palace. In this City is a Senate
of 70 Gentlemen changed every third or fourth year,
who out of their own number elect every two
months 2 Priors and a Gonfalonier, but the Gover∣nour
or Monsignor placed heer by the Pope is the
<HI>Dominus fac totum. Malatesta</HI> tyrant of <HI>Rimini</HI> (as
they call him) seized also upon this place, but was
driven out by Pope <HI>Pius</HI> II, assisted by the Duke of
<HI>Vrbin, Carignano</HI> of <HI>Ancona</HI> and one <HI>Cassaro.</HI> These
two Gentlemen had each of them a ladder for his
arms, the one red, and the other white. The city
out of gratitude took these two ladders for their
Arms, leaving their former, which was a gate or
Arch with this motto under it, <HI>In hac porta stat hîc
Leo fortis.</HI> This City is by some esteemed one of the
best situated in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>We still held along the shore till we came to <HI>Pesa∣ro,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 1. 1664. Pesaro.</NOTE>
anciently <HI>Pisaurum,</HI> 7 miles. This is a very elegant
and pleasant City, having a handsom piazza, en∣compassed
with fair buildings; therein stand many
ancient stones with inscriptions. We passed through a
long well-built street, and had a prospect of the <HI>Cupo∣la</HI>
of the <HI>Domo.</HI> The haven is almost choaked up. It is
walled about and fortified wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h bastions and a castle.
We saw this town only <HI>in transitu,</HI> but it merited a
little demurr. From hence we crossed the Countrey
to a village called <HI>Catolica</HI> 10 miles. We left <HI>Gradara</HI>
on our left hand but came not in sight of it. From
<HI>Catolica</HI> we rode along the Sea-shore for the most
part till we came within 2 or 3 miles of <HI>Rimini,</HI> and
then left the shore and took the <HI>Via Flaminia.</HI> From
<PB N="379" REF="202"/>
<HI>Catolica</HI> to <HI>Rimini</HI> they reckon 15 miles, yet may <HI>Ri∣mini</HI>
easily be seen from thence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rimini.</NOTE> <HI>Rimini</HI> is a pretty
proper City, having streight streets like <HI>Pesaro</HI> and
<HI>Fano,</HI> yet are the buildings but low. Within the
walls of this town we passed under a high stone-arch
erected to <HI>Tiberius (Schottus</HI> saith <HI>Augustus) Caesar,</HI>
but the inscription was somewhat defaced. In the
<HI>piazza</HI> we viewed the stone on which <HI>J. Caesar</HI> is said
to have stood when he made a Speech to his Souldi∣ers,
animating them to accompany him to <HI>Rome</HI> and
invade the Cities liberty. On it are these modern in∣scriptions,

<P>In another <HI>Piazza</HI> we saw a brass statue of <HI>Paulus</HI>
V. Being Carneval time we found the Gentlemen
heer tilting. They ran not at one another but at a
Puppet or man of straw, <HI>Bamboccio</HI> they call it.</P>
<P>We made a digression to S. <HI>Marino,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. S. Mari∣no.</NOTE> a little
town standing on the top of a very high hill, some
10 miles or more distant from <HI>Rimini.</HI> This place
hath maintained it self in the condition of a free
State or Commonwealth, as the Inhabitants boast,
for above 1000 years, but its well if half so long.
The territory of this Republic is but one mountain
about 3 miles in length, and some 9 or ten miles
round. In this small territory they have 4 <HI>Castelli</HI> or
villages, <HI>viz. Serravalle, Fietano, Monte Giardino,</HI> and
<HI>Fiorentino:</HI> 8 corn mills upon the little river <HI>Canova,</HI>
which bounds this territory towards the North, and
a powder-mills: the number of souls is about 4000
or 5000, of Souldiers or fighting men 1500. The
Arms of this Republic are 3 towers upon a moun∣tain,
and under it this Motto, <HI>Libertas perpetua.</HI>
<PB N="380" REF="203"/>
The <HI>Borgho</HI> of S. <HI>Marin</HI> stands at the foot of the hill
upon which the town is built, and is like some of
our <HI>North-Wales</HI> towns. In this <HI>Borgh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> weekly on
Wednesdays is held a market, where are bought and
sold a great number of Swine, especially in Carne∣val
time, 3, 4, or 5 thousand on a market-day. The
reason of this great concourse to buy and sell heer is
because they pay so little toll, <HI>viz.</HI> about six pence for
a drove be they more or less. From the <HI>Borgho</HI> up to
the town are two ascents, the one more easie and
winding about to the furthermost gate, by which
coaches may make a shift to get up, the other steep
to the nearer gate. On one side the town is walled
about, on the other side it needs it not, for it stands
on the brow of a precipitious rock of a very great
height, whereon they have placed 3 towers in a row.
On the side where the wall goes the hill is very steep
and almost impossible to climb but by the made ways.
There is no hill near it that can any way offend it,
and those that are next far lower than that whereon
the town is built. The streets of the town are nar∣row,
and the houses but mean. Heer live about 60
Jews. Two cloysters they have within the walls,
one of discalceate <HI>Franciscans</HI> or <HI>Succolanti,</HI> the
other of Nuns of the Order of <HI>Santa Clara;</HI> with∣out
the walls in the <HI>Borgho</HI> is a Monastery of <HI>Capu∣cines,</HI>
and about a mile from the town a fair Con∣vent
of the <HI>Servitae.</HI> They have 25 small pieces or
Drakes and 2 Culverines. This place is a Bishops
Sea and the Bishop of it is Bishop also of <HI>S. Leo,
Monte Feltre,</HI> and <HI>La Penna.</HI> This Republic is sur∣rounded
by the territory of the Pope; they stamp
no money; they have neither friendship nor enmi∣ty
with any of the States or Princes of <HI>Italy;</HI> and
in the several wars of <HI>Italy</HI> they have enjoyed peace.
On occasion they send Embassadours to the neigh∣bouring
Princes and States. At <HI>Rome</HI> they have their
Protector, who at present is Cardinal <HI>Carlo Barbe∣rini,</HI>
<PB N="381" REF="203"/>
to whom they sometimes send presents, <HI>viz.</HI>
100 little Cheeses or a Butt of <HI>Muscatella.</HI> They ac∣knowledge
no Superior under God, but have abso∣lute
power in civil and criminal causes. If a person
banished from other places retires hither, they some∣timet
give him protection, but it is done by the ma∣jor
vote of the Council. If one man kill another,
though in his own defence, he is sentenced by the
Commissary or Judge to pay 100 <HI>Scudi,</HI> but he pe∣titioning
the Council, they usually bring it down to
25. If one murthers another and flies, he is banish∣ed
for ever and all his goods confiscate. This Repub∣lic
maintains a Physician and a Surgeon at the pub∣lic
charge. The Muscatella's of this place are much
esteemed, and the Gentry heerabout in Summer∣time
come ordinarily hither to drink them, and en∣joy
the <HI>fresco.</HI> Cows they have none, but sheep and
goats good store; of whose milk they make little
cheeses that eat well. From the hill we had a pro∣spect
of <HI>Monte Leone,</HI> a strong fortress formerly be∣longing
to this Republic, but taken from them by
the Duke of <HI>Vrbin.</HI> They have 4 great Fairs every
year, the chiefest of all is on S. <HI>Bartholomew's</HI> day,
at which time there is a general muster of all their
Forces. At these Fairs there is great abundance of
young cattel sold. Many veals driven as far as <HI>Flo∣rence.</HI>
These fairs and markets disgust the neighbour∣ing
Princes, as being a great diminution of their
tolls.</P>
<P>The Government of S. <HI>Marino</HI> is by a Council of
45, which they call <HI>Corpo di Prencipe.</HI> Of these 15
are Gentlemen (for there are about 20 families of
Gentlemen in this State) 15 Artisans or tradesmen
and 15 farmers or count reymen. They continue for
their lives, and when one dies another is chosen by
two third parts of the votes, when a Gentleman a
Gentleman, and so of the rest. These Counsellors
chuse out of their own number from 6 months to
<PB N="382" REF="204"/>
6 months <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Capitanie,</HI> (which have the like power as
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nsuls, or Maior, with us) after this manner.
When the old Captains go out of office they nomi∣nate
12; the names of these are written in 6 scrolls
of Paper, <HI>viz.</HI> two names in a scroll. These scrolls
are put into a hat or box, and a boy puts in his
hand and draws out 3. These 3 the elder Captain
takes and carries to the Church of the Sacrament,
and <HI>Te Deum</HI> being sung, a Priest puts the 3 scrolls
into a hat, and a young child puts in his hand and
draws out one, and they whose names are therein
written are <HI>Capitanei</HI> for the next 6 months. These
<HI>Capitanei</HI> cannot be eleced again for two years fol∣lowing.
Besides, the Great Council elect out of
themselves by major vote a lesser Council of 12, <HI>viz.</HI>
4 out of each order. And to this Council civil and
criminal causes and quarrels of right and wrong are
referred. This Commonwealth hath a Commissary
or Judge, who must be a Doctor of Law, and always
a foreigner. He is elected by the Council and conti∣tinues
18 months. His stipend is ten crowns the
month. His sentence is confirmed, or may be re∣pealed
or mitigated by the Council. The Chancel∣lor
is elected in like manner. He is a notary and his
allowance is 60 scudi or crowns <HI>per annum.</HI> They
have also a Captain of the <HI>Militia,</HI> who continues
in office as long as the Council pleases. But enough
and more then needs will most Readers think of this
petty Commonwealth; concerning which I should
not have been so large, but that no body that I know
of before me hath made any particular description
of its State and Government, as accounting it not
worth their while to enquire into it, or their pains
to set it down.</P>
<P>We travelled from <HI>Rimini</HI> to <HI>Ravenna.</HI> 3. We pas∣sed
the famous bridge over the river <HI>Rimino,</HI> begun
by <HI>Augustus</HI> and finished by <HI>Tiberius.</HI> The people say
that the stones are joyned together without any ce∣ment.
<PB N="383" REF="204"/>
Indeed the sides or walls of it are of vast
stones, each as high as the border and or breadth
proportionable, immediately contiguous without
any morter or cement between that I could discern.
There is upon it an inscription in large letters signi∣fying
when and by whom it was built. At 15 miles
distance from <HI>Rimini</HI> we passed through a little town
called <HI>Cesenatic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> then <HI>Cervia</HI> about 5 miles further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cesena∣tico. Cervia.</NOTE>
a place enveroned with fens. It is a Bisho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Sea and
therefore hath the title of a City, yet is it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t a mean
and pitiful town. All the way between <HI>Cervia</HI> and
<HI>Ravenna</HI> till we came withn 2 or 3 miles of the
town, we had a wood of Pine-trees on our right
hand called <HI>Pigneda,</HI> bearing fruit enough (as <HI>Schot∣tus</HI>
saith) to serve all <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ravenna</HI> stands between two rivers [<HI>Bedesis</HI> and <HI>Montone</HI>]
one running on one side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Raven∣na</NOTE> and the other on
the other. It is a large town but ragged and not
well built, the houses are all very low. It hath 5
gates, an ole castle of brick; 3 very fair Covents,
one called the <HI>Classe,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Monachi Clas∣senses,</HI>
the Church whereof is dedicated to S. <HI>Ro∣mualdo.</HI>
A second called the <HI>Porto,</HI> because it is de∣dicated
to S. <HI>Maria Portuenses.</HI> It belongs to the <HI>Ca∣nonici
reguulares Lateranenses.</HI> A third of <HI>Benedictine</HI>
Monks dedicated to S. <HI>Vitale.</HI> The Church of this
Covent is a double octagon, the one concentrical to
and included in the other, built as they told us by
<HI>Justinian.</HI> The Monks shew'd us heer 2 marble pil∣lars,
for which they said the <HI>Venetians</HI> offered them
their weight in silver; but we have seen the like
elsewhere, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Library at <HI>Zurich,</HI> and at
<HI>Verona</HI> in our Ladies Chappel in the Garden of Seig∣nior
<HI>Horatio Giusti.</HI> Their generation at first was of
a mass or heap of small flints and pebbles united in∣to
one body by a cement petrified as hard as them∣selves
and capable of politure. Probably this cement
was separated by degrees from a fluid wherein these
<PB N="384" REF="205"/>
stones lay. To these Monks belongs the <HI>Rotonda,</HI> a
little round Church dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI>
about ¼ of a mile without the walls: the entire
roof whereof is of one single stone, notwithstand∣ing
that the Diameter of the Church is 14 of my
ordinary paces, which are near so many yards. In
the midst of this stone is a round hole to let in the
light. Upon the top of it formerly stood a porphyry
monument of <HI>Theodoricus</HI> a <HI>Gotthick</HI> King who is
supposed to have built it. This monument is now
taken down and set in the wall of the Covent of the
<HI>Succolanti,</HI> by the way-side with this inscription,
<HI>Vas hoc Porphyriacum ol. Theodorici Gottor. imp. cineres
in Rotundae apice recondens, huc Petro Donato Caesio
Narnien. praesule favente translatum ad perennem me∣moriam
Sapientes Reip. Rav. PP. C. MDLXIII.</HI></P>
<P>The Monastery of the <HI>Succolanti</HI> is one of the
fairest we have seen belonging to that order, and
the Church dedicated to S. <HI>Apollinaris</HI> deserves no∣tice
taking, as well for the double row of marble
pillars brought from <HI>Constantinople</HI> by <HI>Theodoricus,</HI>
as for the ancient figures of Mosaic work in the
walls. In the <HI>Domo</HI> we noted the figures of the Arch∣bishops
of <HI>Ravenna</HI> in Mosaic work. Eleven of them
had a Dove standing upon their heads, which they
say were chosen by a Dove alighting and sitting upon
their heads, the legend whereof may be seen more
at large in <HI>Schottus.</HI> Near the <HI>Franciscans</HI> Cloyster is
the monument of <HI>Dante</HI> the famous Poet, which is
an arch erected to his memory by <HI>Bernardus Bembus</HI>
the <HI>Venetian Podestà</HI> in <HI>Ravenna;</HI> under which is his

<P>These verses are said to have been made by <HI>Dante</HI>
himself, <HI>sed Musis parùm faventibus,</HI> and if he had
not composed better in <HI>Italian</HI> he had not deserved
the reputation of so great a Poet. This City may
boast of its antiquity and what it hath been, not
what it is, and yet the Cardinal Legate Governour
of <HI>Romandiola</HI> usually resides heer. It is very ill ser∣ved
with fish, notwithstanding it is so near the Sea:
there's scarce a good Inn in Town, it lying out of the
way of travellers, and strangers, and being no through∣fare.
What was true of old is true still heer; Its har∣der
to get good water than good wine, <HI>Sit cisternae
mihi quam vinea malo Ravennae,</HI> the water being all
brackish: Neither yet was the wine we met withal
any of the best. I wonder this City should not be
more populous and rich; the Countrey on the
Northside all along to <HI>Faenza,</HI> seeming to be fat and
fertile land, and being planted after the manner of
<HI>Lombardy.</HI> It lies indeed very low, yet I believe
now adays is never overflown.</P>
<P>We observed in this journey from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Venice</HI>
a great difference between the temperature of the
air on this side and on the other side the <HI>Appennine</HI>
<PB N="386" REF="206"/>
mountains, on the other side it being very tempe∣rate
and warm, but on this side as cold and raw as
it is at any time in winter with us, or indeed can
well be in open weather; and that this cold did not
proceed from a general change of weather since our
coming on this side we are well assured; for we heard
of no such change, and we found snow lying heer in
the low grounds in many places, which on the other
side was all melted and gone even upon the hills be∣fore
our coming over. The reason of this is obvious,
because this ridge of hills being higher than the low∣er
region of the air, or place where the Sun-beams
are reflected, hinders the commixture of the warm
Southerly and Western air with the cold Northerly
and Eastern, but especially stopping on one hand
the South and West winds which else would drive
the temperate air and tepid vapours into these parts;
and on the other hand the cold Northern and Eastern
blasts, which else would temper and much abate the
warmth of those beyond the mountains. Hence I do
not think incredible nor much wonder at what is
related by some Travellers of a mountain in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
on the one side whereof it is Summer when
on the other it is Winter.</P>
<P>We left <HI>Ravenna</HI> and rode along the bank of the

<HI>Faenza.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5.</NOTE> The Countrey on each side this river was

we changed our boat again, coming into the river
<HI>Po:</HI> In the <HI>Po</HI> we were rowed down stream about 27

struck into a channel on our left hand, passing a

<HEAD>Of the natural Abilities, Temper and In∣clinations,
Manners and Customs, Vir∣tues
and Vices of the Italians.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Italians</HI> are, by the general confession of
all that write of them, ingenious, apprehen∣sive
of any thing and quick-witted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Icon. anim.</NOTE> <HI>Barclay</HI> (who
is not too favourable to them in the Character he
gives of them) saith, they have <HI>animum rerum om∣nium
capacem;</HI> and again that there is nothing so
difficult <HI>ad quod Italici acuminis praestantia non tolla∣tur.</HI></P>
<P>They are patient and assiduous in any thing they
set about or desire to learn, never giving over till
they master it and attain the perfection of it.</P>
<P>They are a still, quiet people, as being naturally
melancholy; of a middle temper between the fa∣stuous
gravity of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and unquiet levity of
the <HI>French,</HI> agreeing very well with the <HI>English,</HI> as
the <HI>Scots</HI> are observed to do with the <HI>French,</HI> and
<HI>Spaniards</HI> with the <HI>Irish.</HI></P>
<P>They are very faithful and loving to their friends,
mindful of a courtesie received, and if it lies in their
way or power for one good turn will do you two.
This I had from a very intelligent person who hath
lived and conversed long enough among them to
know them throughly. <HI>Barclay</HI> himself confesseth,
that where they do truly love <HI>omnia discrimina ha∣bent
infra tam humani foederis sanctitatem.</HI> Understand
it of the better so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; for Shopkeepers and Trades∣men
are false and fraudulent enough; and Inn-keep∣ers,
Carriers, Watermen and Porters as in other pla∣ces
horribly exacting if you make not an explicit
<PB N="393" REF="209"/>
bargain with them beforehand: insomuch that in
many places the State hath thought it necessary by
public <HI>Bando</HI> and decree to determine how much Inn-keepers
shall receive of travellers for their dinner
and for their supper and lodging.</P>
<P>They are not easily provoked, but will bear long
with one another; and more with strangers than
their own Countreymen. They are also very careful
to avoid all occasions of quarrel; not to say or do
any thing that may offend any person, especially not
to abuse any one by jesting or drollery; which they
do not like nor can easily bear.</P>
<P>No people in <HI>Europe</HI> are more scrupulous and ex∣act
in observing all the <HI>punctilio's</HI> of civility and good
breeding (<HI>bella creanza</HI> they call it) only methinks
the Epithets they bestow upon mean persons are
somewhat extravagant, not to say ridiculous, as
when they stile a mechanic or common tradesman
<HI>Signor molto magnifico</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>When they are in company together they do not
only give every man his turn of speaking, but also
attend till he hath done, accounting it a piece of
very ill breeding to interrupt any man in his dis∣course,
as hating to be interrupted themselves. Con∣trary
to the manner of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who
make no scruple of interrupting one another, and
sometimes talk all together. As careful are they, not
to whisper privately one to another when in compa∣ny,
or to talk in an unknown language which all the
company understands not. They do also shew their
civility to strangers in not so much as asking them
what Religion they are of, avoiding all unnecessary
disputes about that subject, which are apt to engen∣der
quarrels: which thing we could not but take no∣tice
of, because in <HI>France</HI> you shall searce exchange
three words with any man, before he ask you that
question.</P>
<P>It is not easie for a stranger to get acquaintance and
<PB N="394" REF="210"/>
familiarity with the <HI>Italians,</HI> they not much delight∣ing
to converse with strangers, as not knowing their
humours and customs. Yet is their conversation when
gotten pleasant and agreeable, their discourse profit∣able
and carriage obliging.</P>
<P>Most of them, even of the ordinary sort of peo∣ple,
will discourse intelligently about Politic affairs
and the government and interest of their own Coun∣trey;
being much addicted to and delighted in Po∣litic
studies and discourses.</P>
<P>Most of them are very covetous of liberty, espe∣cially
such Cities as have been formerly Common-wealths,
discourses or treatises of that subject ma∣king
deep impressions on their minds: So that in
some places not only books but also discourses about
former revolutions are prohibited. <HI>Barclay</HI> also saith,
that they are <HI>gloriosae libertatis cupidi, cujus adhuc
imaginem vident.</HI> Hence the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> build
store of Castles and cittadels in their territories, not
so much to defend themselves against their enemies
as to bridle their Subjects, and secure themselves
against tumults and insurrections. A strange thing
it is, that of all the people of <HI>Italy</HI> the <HI>Neapolitans,</HI>
who never tasted the sweetness of liberty, nor men∣ded
their condition by their commotions, but always
(as we say) <HI>leapt out of the frying-pan into the fire,</HI> should be the most tumultuous and given to rebel
against their Princes. <HI>Leti</HI> tells us of one of those
petty subordinate Princes in this Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI>
called <HI>Thomaso Ferrari,</HI> who governed his subjects
not like vassals, but with that sweetness and gen∣tleness,
as if they had been his own children; yet
some of these fellows taking arms come into their
Princes presence, and say to him, <HI>Sir Prince, we are
come to drive you out of your Palace and burn all your
moveables. Why</HI> (answers the Prince) <HI>can you find
fault with my government? Are you aggrieved in any
thing and it shall be redressed: No</HI> (replied they)
<PB N="395" REF="210"/>
<HI>but because we understand that many of our Countrey∣men
have revolted from their Lords, we also to shew that
we love revolutions, are resolved to rebel against you.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Italians</HI> are greatly delighted in Pictures,
statues and music from the highest to the lowest of
them, and so intemperately fond of these things
that they will give any rate for a choice picture or
statue. Though all of them cannot paint or play on
the music, yet do they all affect skill and judgment
in both: And this knowledge is enough to deno∣minate
a man a <HI>virtuoso.</HI> Many of them are also cu∣rious
in collecting ancient coyns and medals.</P>
<P>They are great admirers of their own language,
and so wholly given to cultivate, polish and enrich
that, that they do in a great measure neglect the <HI>La∣tine,</HI>
few of them now adays speaking or writing
well therein; but mingling so many <HI>Italian</HI> idio∣tisms
with it, that you have much ado to understand
what they speak or write. As for the <HI>Greek,</HI> few or
none have any tolerable skill in it, the study thereof
being generally neglected and laid aside.</P>
<P>They are very temperate in their diet, eating a
great deal of sallet and but little flesh. Their wine they
drink well diluted with water, and seldom to any
excess. We saw only one <HI>Italian</HI> drunk by the space
of a year and half that we sojourned in <HI>Italy.</HI> Whe∣ther
it be that in hot Countreys men have not so
good stomachs as in cold; or whether meat as be∣ing
better concocted nourishes more there; or that
the <HI>Italians</HI> are out of principle, temper or custom
more sober and temperate than other nations. Their
herbs seemed to me more savory and better concocted
than ours. Their water also was not so crude. But for
flesh ours in my judgment much excels theirs, being
much more succulent and sapid. Yet in <HI>Rome</HI> have I
eaten beef not inferiour to ours: but I suppose it might
be of <HI>German</HI> oxen; of which (as we were informed)
there are many driven thither: and for sucking veal
<PB N="396" REF="211"/>
the <HI>Romans</HI> (as we have already noted) think theirs
preferrable to any in the world.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italians,</HI> especially those of inferiour quali∣ty,
are in all things very sparing and frugal: Whe∣ther
it be because they are so educated and accustom∣ed,
or because the gabels and taxes which they pay
to their governours are so great that they cannot af∣ford
to spend much on themselves; or because na∣turally
loving their case they had rather live nearly
then take much pains.</P>
<P>The Nobility and great persons chuse rather to
spend their revenues in building fair palaces and
adorning them with Pictures and statues, in making
stately and spacious orachards, gardens and walks, in
keeping coaches and horses and a great retinue of
servants and staffiers, than in keeping great houses
and plentiful tables; giving board-wages to their
servants and attendants, which in my opinion is the
better way of spending estates, these things finding
poor people employment, so that the money comes
to be distributed among them according to their in∣dustry;
whereas the other way maintains in idle∣ness
such persons for the most part as least deserve
relief: those that are modest and deserving chusing
rather (if possibly they can) to maintain themselves
and their families by the labour of their hands, than
hang about great houses for a meals meat. Besides
that great house-keeping is very often, not to say al∣ways,
the occasion of great disorder and intempe∣rance.
Were I therefore Gods steward for a great
estate (for such all rich men are or ought to be) I
should think it more charity to employ poor people
and give them mony for their work, than to distri∣bute
my estate among them freely and suffer them to
live in idleness, I mean such as are able to labour.</P>
<P>The inferiour Gentry affect to appear in public
with as much splendour as they can, and will deny
themselves many satisfactions at home that they may
<PB N="397" REF="211"/>
be able to keep a coach, and therein make the <HI>tour
à la mode</HI> about the streets of their City every even∣ing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italians</HI> when they call, speak to, or of one
another, use only the Christian name, as <HI>Signor
Giacomo, Signor Giovanni,</HI> &amp;c. unless it be for distin∣ctions
sake, so that you may converse among them
perchance some months before you hear any mans
surname mentioned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italian</HI> Gentry live for the most part in the
Cities, whence it is that the Cities are so splendid
and well built, so populous and rich; and the
Countrey so poor and thinly inhabited. Yet are the
Noblemens Palaces rather great and stately, than
commodious for habitation. In many Cities the pa∣per
windows (which are for the most part tatter'd
and broken) disgrace the buildings, being unsuitable
to their magnificence.</P>
<P>The houses are generally built of stone, thick
walled and high rooft, which makes them warm in
Winter and cool in Summer: but they contrive
them rather for coolness than warmth, and therefore
make the windows large to give them air enough.</P>
<P>Of the Gentry in <HI>Italy,</HI> especially in <HI>Venice,</HI> if
there be many brothers of one house only one usual∣ly
marries, and that the eldest if he pleases; if he
be not disposed then any other, as they can agree
among themselves. The rest do what they can to
greaten him that is married, to uphold the Family.
The brothers that marry not keep concubines or
whores; which though it be sin, yet their Confes∣sors
can easily absolve them of it.</P>
<P>In most of the Cities and Towns of <HI>Italy</HI> there
are <HI>Academies</HI> or Societies of <HI>Virtuosi,</HI> who have at
set times their meetings and exercises, which are
for the most part prolusions of wit and <HI>Rhetoric,</HI> or
discourses about moral subjects, curious questions
and Problems, or Paradoxes, sometimes extempo∣rany,
<PB N="398" REF="212"/>
sometimes premeditated. These have their
head whom they call Prince, and a certain number
of Academists, who are chosen by balloting, but
they seldom refuse any that offer themselves to ele∣ction.
Many of these Academies assume to them∣selves
conceited or fanciful names, and take a sute∣able
<HI>imprese</HI> or coat of arms; as for example the
<HI>Academists</HI> of <HI>Bergamo</HI> call themselves <HI>Eccitati,</HI> and
their imprese is the picture of the morning. In <HI>Man∣tua</HI>
the Academists called <HI>Accesi</HI> have taken for their
Emblem a Looking-glass reflecting the Sun-beams;
those called <HI>Timidi</HI> a hare. As for the other Cities
of <HI>Italy,</HI> in <HI>Rome</HI> there are 3 <HI>Academies,</HI> the <HI>Hu∣moristi,</HI>
the <HI>Lyncei</HI> and the <HI>Fantastici:</HI> in <HI>Padua 3,</HI>
the <HI>Ricoverati, Infiammati</HI> and <HI>Incogniti:</HI> in <HI>Bologna 3,
Ardenti, Indomiti,</HI> and one innominate: in <HI>Venice 2,
Discordanti</HI> and <HI>Gussoni:</HI> in <HI>Naples 2, Ardenti</HI> and
<HI>Intronati:</HI> in <HI>Luca 2, Oscuri</HI> and <HI>Freddi:</HI> in <HI>Florence

<P>Most of the <HI>Italians</HI> of any fashion wear black or
dark coloured cloths, and for the fashion of them
follow the <HI>French</HI> (but not too hastily) excepting
those Countries which are subject to the King of
<HI>Spain;</HI> which use the <HI>Spanish</HI> habit.</P>
<P>As for their vices, they are chiefly taxed for three.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Revenge;</HI> they thinking it an ignoble and un∣manly
thing to put up or pass by any injury or af∣front.
Many times also they dissemble or conceal
their displeasure and hatred under a pretence of
<PB N="399" REF="212"/>
friendship, that they may more easily revenge them∣selves
of whom they hate by poisoning, assassinating
or any other way; for nothing will satisfie them
but the death of those who have injured them: and
there be <HI>Bravo's</HI> and cut-throats ready to murther
any man for a small piece of mony. Besides, which
is worst of all, they are implacable, and by no means
to be trusted when they say they pardon. Hence they
have a Proverb among them, <HI>Amicitie reconciliate &amp;
menestre riscaldate non furono mai grate.</HI> The women
also provoke their children to revenge the death of
their fathers by shewing them the weapons where∣with
they were murthered, or cloths dipt in their
blood or the like, by which means feuds between
families are maintained and entail'd from generati∣on
to generation. These are the qualities for which
we usually say, An <HI>English</HI> man <HI>Italianate</HI> is a De∣vil
incarnate.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Lust,</HI> to which the inhabitants of hot Coun∣treys
are by the temper of their bodies inclined.
Hence it is that all Cities and great Towns do so
swarm with Courtezans and Harlots; and to avoid
worse evils the State is necessitated to give them pub∣lic
toleration and protection. As for masculine
venery and other works of darkness, I shall not charge
the <HI>Italians</HI> with them, as not having sufficient
ground so to do; and because (as <HI>Barclay</HI> saith) <HI>Haec
scelera tenebris damnata &amp; negari faciliùs à consciis
possunt, &amp; ab aemulis fingi.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>Jealousie,</HI> which strangely possesses this peo∣ple;
so that for every little suspicion they will shut
up their wives in a chamber, and carry the key with
them, not suffering them to stir abroad unless them∣selves
accompany them. To salute an <HI>Italians</HI> wife
with a kiss is a stabbing matter; and to call a man
<HI>cornuto</HI> or Cuckold in good earnest is the greatest af∣front
or disgrace you can put upon him. The mar∣ried
women in <HI>Italy</HI> by this means have but bad
<PB N="400" REF="213"/>
lives, being for the most part confined to their hou∣ses
except when they go to Church, and then they
have an old woman attending them: the doors of
their houses shut up at dinner and supper; all visits
and familiar discourses with men denied them; nei∣ther
can they speak or smile without suspicion: one
reason of this among others may be, because the
husbands knowing themselves to be so dishonest and
false to their wives, they presume that had they op∣portunity
they would not be more true to them.
And yet for all this guarding and circumspecti∣on
are not the <HI>Italian</HI> Dames more uncorrupt than
the matrons of other Nations, but find means to de∣ceive
their husbands, and be dishonest in spight of
jealousie.</P>
<P>To these I might add <HI>Swearing,</HI> which is so or∣dinary
among all sorts, the Priests and Monks them∣selves
scarce abstaining from oaths, that I believe
they account it no sin.</P>
<P>It is a general custom all over <HI>Italy</HI> to sleep an
hour or two after dinner in Summer time; so that
from two of the clock till four in the afternoon you
shall scarce see any body stirring about the streets of
the Cities. Indeed if one sits still it is very hard to
keep his eyes open at that time. Either this custom
did not prevail when the School of <HI>Salerno</HI> wrote
their Physic precepts, or that direction, <HI>Sit brevis
ant nullus tibi somnus meridianus,</HI> was calculated for
<HI>England,</HI> to whose King that Book was dedicated.
And yet the <HI>Italian</HI> Physicians still advise people ei∣ther
not to sleep at all after dinner, or if they must
sleep, to strip off their cloths and go to bed, or on∣ly
to take a nod in a chair sitting.</P>
<P>In many Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> are Hospitals where Pil∣grims
and poor travellers are entertained, and have
their diet and lodging for three days (if they have
reason to stay so long) <HI>gratis,</HI> besides a piece of mo∣ny
when they go away.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="213"/>
There are also Hospitals to receive exposed chil∣dren,
if I may so term them; that is, any without
exception that shall be brought and put in at a grate
on purpose, whither upon ringing of a bell an Of∣ficer
comes presently and receives the child, and
asking the party that brought it, whether it hath
been baptized? carries it to a nurse to give it suck;
and there it is maintained till it be grown up. The
place where it is put in is so strait as to admit only
children new born or very young. This I look upon
as a good institution in great Cities, taking away
from women the temptation of murthering their
new-born children, or destroying their conceptions
in the womb, to hide their shame. I know what
may be objected against it, <HI>viz.</HI> that it emboldens
them to play the wantons, having so fair a way of
concealing it: <HI>Sed ex malis minimum.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Rome, Venice</HI> and some other Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> they
have a way of exercising charity little used among
us. Several Confraternities of well-disposed per∣sons
raise sums of mony by a free contribution
among themselves, which they bestow yearly in
portions for the marrying of poor maids, which else
might want husbands, and be tempted to dishonest
practises to maintain themselves. This I look upon
as well-plac'd alms and worthy the imitation; it be∣ing
very convenient and in a manner necessary, that
new-married people should have somewhat to fur∣nish
their houses and begin the world with; and no
less fitting, that young persons should be encouraged
to marry, as well for multiplying of people, where∣in
the strength of the Commonwealth chiefly con∣sists,
as for the preventing those evils to which
young and single persons are strongly tempted and
inclined.</P>
<P>It is troublesome thing to travel with fire-arms
in <HI>Italy,</HI> you being forc'd in most Cities to leave
them at the gate with the Guard, who give you a
<PB N="402" REF="214"/>
tally or token; and when you Leave the City you
bring your tally and receive your arms. This is done
to prevent assaults and murthers, which are so fre∣quent
in many Cities of <HI>Italy.</HI> For this the G. <HI>Duke</HI>
of <HI>Tuscany</HI> is much to be commended, there being
no such muthers and outrages committed in any
of the Cities under his dominion as in other places:
so diliegent is he in searching out, and severe in pu∣nishing
<HI>Bravo's,</HI> Cut-throats, Assassins and such kind
of malefactors. As much might be said for the <HI>Pope</HI>
in the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> but in other Cities in his Ter∣ritories
there is killing enough.</P>
<P>When you depart from any City you must be sure
to take a <HI>bill</HI> of <HI>health</HI> out of the Office that is kept
every where for that purpose: without which you
can hardly get to be admitted into another City, es∣pecially
if it be in the Territory of another Prince
or State. If any one comes from an infected or sus∣pected
place he is forced to keep his <HI>Quarantain</HI> (as
they call it) that is, be shut up in the <HI>Lazaretto</HI> or
Pest-house 40 days before he be permitted to come
into the City. So scrupulously careful are they to pre∣vent
Contagion.</P>
<P>In <HI>Rome</HI> and other Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> we have often
observed many labourers that wanted work standing
in the market places to be hired; whither people
that want help usually go and bargain with them.
Which custom illustrates that Parable of our <HI>Saviour</HI>
recorded in the beginning of the 20th. Chapter of
S. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Gospel, wherein the housholder is said
<HI>to go out about the third hour, and see others standing
in the market-place,</HI> ver. 3. and in <HI>ver.</HI> 6. he is said <HI>to
find others about the eleventh hour,</HI> and to say to them,
<HI>why stand ye heer all the day idle;</HI> and <HI>ver. 7.</HI> they an∣swer,
<HI>because no man hath hired us.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Italy</HI> and other hot Countreys so soon as they
have cut down their corn they thresh and winnow
it usually, or at least a great part of it, on a floor
<PB N="403" REF="214"/>
made in the open air, before they bring it into the
house. Hence in the Scripture we read of threshing
floors as open places without roof or cover. Such I
suppose was that where <HI>Boaz</HI> winnowed barley,
<HI>Ruth 3. 3.</HI> Neither is it any wonder that he should
lie there all night: for at <HI>Aleppo</HI> and even in <HI>Malta</HI>
in Summer time they set their beds upon the roofs of
their houses, and sleep <HI>sub Dio,</HI> in the open air.</P>
<P>One custom we have in <HI>England,</HI> which (as far as
I could observe) is no where used beyond the Seas,
and that is for children to beg their Parents and
Godfathers blessing upon the knee.</P>
<P>One custom which prevails generally in foreign
Countreys is but little used in <HI>England,</HI> that is to sa∣lute
those that sneez by vailing the bonnet, and pray∣ing
God to bless, assist or defend them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is a kind of sport or game much used this
day by the <HI>Italians,</HI> called <HI>Gioco di mora,</HI> which
seems to have been used by the ancients and called
<HI>micare digitis.</HI> It is for the most part between two,
who put out just at the same time each of them as
many fingers as they please and also name each of
them what number he thinks fit, and if either of
them happens to be the number of the fingers which
both of them together threw out, then he that names
that number wins one.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Several sorts of Meats, Fruits, Sallets,
&amp;c. used in Italy, and other Observati∣ons
about Diet.</HEAD>
<P>1. IN <HI>Lombardy</HI> and other parts of <HI>Italy, Tartufale</HI>
(as they call them) i. e. <HI>Tubera Terrae,</HI> a kind of
subterraneous Mushrome, which our Herbarists
<PB N="404" REF="215"/>
<HI>English Trubs,</HI> or after the <HI>French</HI> name <HI>Trufles,</HI> are
accounted a choice dish, held by naturalists to be in∣centive
of lust. The best of all are gotten in <HI>Sicily,</HI>
and thence sent over into <HI>Malta,</HI> where they are sold
dear. The way to get them is to turn swine into a
field where they grow, who find them by the smell,
and root them up out of the ground, and set one to
follow the swine, and gather them up.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Snails</HI> boil'd and served up with oyl and pepper
put into their shells are also accounted a good dish: I
am sure they are sold dear at <HI>Venice</HI> and elsewhere, es∣pecially
the great whitish or ash-coloured. shell-snails,
which we had not then seen in <HI>England,</HI> but have
since found plentifully upon the Downs near <HI>Darking</HI>
in <HI>Surrey,</HI> whither (as we were informed by the ho∣nourable
<HI>Charles Howard</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>) they were brought
from beyond Seas by.
Mr. <HI>Martin Lister</HI> hath found them on the banks of
that hollow lane, leading from <HI>Puckeridge</HI> to <HI>Ware.</HI>
These snails before winter stop up the mouth or
aperture of their shells with a thick hard white paste
like a good lute or plaister, and are kept all Winter
in barrels or other vessels, and sold by the Poulter∣ers.
The first place where we met them to be sold in
the market was <HI>Vienna</HI> in <HI>Austria,</HI> where they imi∣tate
the <HI>Italians</HI> as well in their diet as in the manner
of their buildings.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Frogs</HI> are another <HI>Italian</HI> viand which we in
<HI>England</HI> eat not. These they usually fry and serve up
with oil. At <HI>Venice</HI> they eat only the loins and hind∣legs,
as also at <HI>Florence,</HI> and that upon fish-days. In
some places of <HI>Lombardy</HI> they eat their whole bo∣dies,
and besides their frogs are of a larger size than
ordinary. Their flesh shews white and lovely as they
lie in the markets skin'd and ready prepared to be
fried. Howbeit even there in <HI>Italy, Kircher</HI> in his
book <HI>de Peste</HI> condemns them as an ambiguous and
dangerous meat, and I think deservedly; wherefore
<PB N="405" REF="215"/>
we do well having plenty of better food, wholly to
abstain from them.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Land Tortoises</HI> are accounted with them a better
meat than Sea-tortoises, and are commonly to be
sold in the markets. They are eaten by those Orders
of Freres whose rule obliges them to abstain from
flesh, as <HI>Carthusians, Carmelites,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>5. They eat also many sorts of <HI>Shell-fish,</HI> which
we either have not or meddle not with, as Purples,
Periwinkles of several sorts, <HI>Patellae</HI> or Limpets,
Sea-urchins, which last are to be found every day in
the markets at <HI>Naples.</HI> They also eat the Sea-tortoi∣ses,
of which the blood put into the stomach and
boil'd is the best part.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Paste</HI> made into strings like pack-thread or
thongs of whit-leather (which if greater they call
<HI>Macaroni,</HI> if lesser <HI>Vermicelli</HI>) they cut in pieces and
put in their pots as we do oat-meal to make their
<HI>menestra</HI> or broth of, much esteemed by the common∣people.
These boil'd and oil'd with a little cheese
scraped upon them they eat as we do buttered wheat
or rice. The making of these is a trade and mystery;
and in every great town you shall see several shops of
them.</P>
<P>7. They scrape or grate <HI>Cheese</HI> upon all their
dishes even of flesh; accounting that it gives the
meat a good rellish; which to those that are unaccu∣stomed
makes it rather nauseous or loathsome.</P>
<P>8. <HI>Chesnuts</HI> roasted and the kernels served up
with juyce of Lemon and sugar are much esteemed,
and by some called the <HI>Pistachios</HI> of <HI>Italy.</HI> At <HI>Bono∣nia</HI>
they grind them and make little cakes of the
flower of them, which though eaten by the poor
are no desirable dainty to a delicate palate. Roasted
Chesnuts are a great part of the diet of the poor Pe∣sants
in <HI>Italy;</HI> as we have elsewhere noted.</P>
<P>9. They eat all manner of <HI>small birds</HI> as well as
the <HI>Germans,</HI> viz. <HI>Wrens, Stares, Titmise, Butcher-birds,</HI>
<PB N="406" REF="216"/>
&amp;c. and several great ones which we touch
not in <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Mag-pies, Jayes, Wood-peckers,
Jack-daws,</HI> &amp;c. nay we have frequently seen <HI>Kites</HI>
and <HI>Hawks</HI> lying on the Peulterers stalls; as we have
already noted in our description of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>10. They use several herbs for <HI>Sallets,</HI> which are
not yet, or have been but lately used in <HI>England:
v. g. Selleri,</HI> which is nothing else but sweet smal∣lage,
the young shoots whereof with a little of the
head of the root cut off, they eat raw with oyl and
pepper: In like manner they eat Fennel: Artichoke
also they eat raw with the same sauce; [the same
part of it that is eaten boild.] In <HI>Sicily</HI> at the high∣est
village upon that side Mount <HI>Aetna</HI> that we as∣cended,
they gave us to eat for a Sallet the stalks of
a tall prickly thistle, bearing a yellow flower, I sup∣pose
it was the <HI>Carduus Chrysanthemus</HI> Dod. which
the rankness of the soil had caused to mount up to
that stature. Besides in most of their sallets they
mingle Rocket, (<HI>Rachetta</HI> they call it) which to me
gives them an odious taste. <HI>Curl'd Endive</HI> blancht is
much used beyond Seas; and for a raw sallet seemed
to excel Lettuce it self: Besides it hath this advan∣tage
that it may be kept all Winter.</P>
<P>11. Many <HI>fruits</HI> they eat which we either have not
or eat not in <HI>England,</HI> v. g. <HI>Jujubes,</HI> sold by the
Hucksters while they are yet green: <HI>L'azarole,</HI> the
fruit of the <HI>Mespilus Aronia,</HI> of a pleasant acid taste:
both fruit and tree exactly like the common Haw∣thorn,
but bigger. <HI>Services</HI> or <HI>Sorbes</HI> the true, as
big as little Pears; those that grow with us are the
fruit of the <HI>Sorbus torminalis: Green figs</HI> both white
and blew in great plenty; a most delicate fruit when
fully ripe, comparable for the taste to the best mar∣malade,
and which may be eaten freely without
danger of surfeiting: The husks or cods of <HI>Carobs,</HI>
called in <HI>Latine Siliqua dulcis,</HI> in <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the
word used <HI>Luke</HI> 15. 16. and therefore by some sup∣posed
<PB N="407" REF="216"/>
to be the husks the Prodigal is said to have de∣sired
to fill his belly with. Indeed we thought
them fitter meat from swine than men; for though
they had a sweet taste, yet afterwards they troubled
our stomachs and purged us: but they have not up∣on
all men the like effect; for the <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
eat them ordinarily without any such trou∣ble:
<HI>Love-apples: Mad-apples</HI> both raw and pick∣led:
<HI>Water-melons;</HI> which they use to eat to cool
and refresh them, and some Physicians allow sick
persons to eat them in Feavers. They are almost as
as big as Pompions, have a green rind and a reddish
pulp with blackish seed when ripe. The <HI>Italians</HI> call
these <HI>Cucumeri,</HI> whereas Cucumers they call <HI>Citrulli.</HI>
Several sorts of Gourds, as <HI>Cucurbita lagenaria,</HI> and
<HI>Cucurbita flexuosasive anguina;</HI> which eats very well
boild in pottage: <HI>Cucumis anguinus,</HI> which is more
esteemed and indeed better tasted then the Cucum∣ber.
The common people both in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI>
eat green Chich-pease raw, as our people do com∣mon
pease.</P>
<P>12. In their Desserts and second courses they com∣monly
serve up pine-kernels, and in time of year
green Almonds: also a kind of sweet-meat or Con∣fection
made up of mustard and sugar, which they
call <HI>Italian</HI> mustard.</P>
<P>13. To cool and refresh their wines they use ge∣nerally
snow, where it may easily be had, else ice,
which they keep in conservatories all Summer. With∣out
snow they that are used to it do not willingly
drink, no not in winter.</P>
<P>14. In the Kingdoms of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> they
make a sort of cheese which they call <HI>Caseo di cavallo,</HI>
i. e. Horse-cheese, for what reason I could not learn.
These cheeses they make up in several forms; some
in the fashion of a blown bladder, some in the fa∣shion
of a cylinder and some in other figures. They
are neither fat nor strong, yet well-tasted and accep∣able
<PB N="408" REF="217"/>
to such as have eaten of them a while. The pulp
or body of them lies in flakes and hath as it were a
grain one way like wood. They told us that they
were made of Buffles milk, but we believed them
not, because we observed not many Buffles in those
Countries, where there is more of this cheese made
than of other sorts.</P>
<P>15. In <HI>Italy</HI> and other hot Countries their meat
is not only naturally more lean and dry then ours,
but they roast it also till it be ready to fall from the
bones, and there be little juyce left in it. Besides
when they roast their meat they draw coals under the
spit, and let the fat drop on them, the <HI>nidor</HI> where∣of
perfumes the meat, but not our gust who are
not used to it, and what they lose in dripping they
save in fewel. Their roasting differs not much from
our broiling or carbonadoing. I speak this of or∣dinary
Inns and mean peoples houses, in great houses
and Inns it is otherwise.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italians</HI> count not their hours as we do, from
twelve to twelve, beginning at midday and mid∣night;
but from one to four and twenty, beginning
their count at Sun-set, which is a much more trouble∣some
way; the setting of the Sun being a moveable
point or term, and they being therefore necessitated
to alter and new-set their clocks every day: whereas
midday and midnight being fixt points, the clocks
need no setting anew. As for <HI>Italy</HI> in general,
though the <HI>Italians</HI> imagine it to be the best Coun∣trey
in the world, and have a Proverb among them
that <HI>Italy is the garden of the world:</HI> yet setting
aside <HI>Lombardy, Campania</HI> and some few other
places, the rest is mountainous and barren enough:
the earth so parcht by the Sun-beams that it bears no
grass, and (as <HI>Barclay</HI> faith) seldom yieldeth grain
enough for three year successively to supply the ne∣cessities
and uses of its inhabitants, whatever they
may boast of the <HI>Itala gleba.</HI> The reason why the
<PB N="409" REF="217"/>
<HI>Italians</HI> are so conceited of their own Countrey is,
because they seldom travel abroad, and so see not
the beauty and fertility of others.</P>
<P>I might have taken notice of the vast and incredi∣ble
number of Religious houses there are in <HI>Italy.</HI> I
have sometimes thought they might in all of both
sexes amount to eight or ten thousand. Of these the
Gentlemen make advantage. For such of their daugh∣ters
as either they cannot get husbands for, or are
not able to give portions to, suitable to their birth
and quality, they can in one of these houses for a smal
matter honourably dispose of and settle for their
lives. The institution of such houses as these, whi∣ther
young women of quality, who for want of
sufficient fortunes or personal endowments cannot
easily provide themselves suteable matches, might
retire and find honourable provision, might per∣chance
be tolerable, yea commendable, were they
purged from all superstition the women not admit∣ted
too young, and under no vow of perpetual cha∣stity,
only to leave the house in case they married.
But because of the danger of introducing Monkery,
I think it more safe for a Christian State not to per∣mit
any such foundations.</P>
<P>Bussles are a common beast in <HI>Italy,</HI> and they make
use of them to draw their wains as we do of oxen:
only because they are somewhat fierce and un∣ruly,
they are forced to lead them by an iron-ring
put in their noses, as our Bear-wards do their Bears.</P>
<P>For insects the most remarkable sorts which we
want in <HI>England,</HI> are,</P>
<P>1. The <HI>Cicadae</HI> before mentioned.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>flying Glow-worms,</HI> which are there
every where to be seen in Summer time. These fly∣ing
or winged Glow-worms are nothing else but the
males of the common creeping or unwinged Glow-worm
<HI>Fabius Columna</HI> relates, that <HI>Carolus Vinti∣miglia</HI>
of <HI>Palermo</HI> in <HI>Sicily</HI> having out of curiosity
<PB N="410" REF="218"/>
kept many unwinged Glow-worms in a glass did
put in among them a flying one, which presently in
his sight did couple with them one by one after the
manner of silk-worms; and that the next day the
unwinged ones or females began to lay their eggs.
That the males are also flying insects in <HI>England,</HI>
though they do but rarely or not at all shine with us,
we are assured by an eye-witness, who saw them in
conjunction with the common shining unwinged
Glow-worms. Heer by the way it may not be amiss
to impart to the Reader a discovery made by a cer∣tain
Gentleman and communicated to me by <HI>Francis
Jessop</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which is, that those reputed Meteors
called in Latine <HI>Ignes fatui,</HI> and known in <HI>England</HI>
by the conceited names of <HI>Jack with a Lanthorn,</HI> and
<HI>Will with a Wisp,</HI> are nothing else but swarms of
these flying Glow-worms. Which if true, we may
give an easie account of those strange <HI>phaenomena</HI> of
these supposed fires, <HI>viz.</HI> their suddain motion from
place to place and leading travellers that follow them
into bogs and precipices.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Scorpions,</HI> which in <HI>Italy</HI> sting not, or at least
their stings are not venenose, as the learned <HI>Franciscus
Redi</HI> affirms; though by experience he found
the stinging of the <HI>African</HI> Scorpions to be mortal,
or at least very noxious.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Tarantula's</HI> so called because found about <HI>Ta∣rentum,</HI>
(though we have seen of them at <HI>Rome</HI>)
which are nothing else but a large sort of Spiders;
the biting whereof is esteemed venemous, and
thought to put people into Phrenetic fits, enforcing
them to dance to certain tunes of the Music, by
which means they are cured, long and violent exer∣cise
causing a great evacution by sweat. These fits
they say do also yearly return at the same season the
Patient was bitten. But Dr. <HI>Thomas Cornelius</HI> of <HI>Co∣senza</HI>
before mentioned, a learned Physician and
Virtuoso in <HI>Naples,</HI> diligently enquiring into this ge∣nerally
<PB N="411" REF="218"/>
received and heertofore unquestioned story,
that he might satisfie himself and others whether it
were really true in experience.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Cimiei</HI> as the <HI>Italians</HI> call them, as the <HI>French
Punaise.</HI> We <HI>English</HI> them Chinches or Wall-lice,
which are very noisome and troublesome by their
bitings in the night time, raising a great heat and
redness in the skin. They harbour in the straw of
the bolsters and mattresses and in the wood of the
bedsteds, and therefore in some <HI>Nosocomia</HI>
or Hospi∣tals
for sick persons, as for example at <HI>Genua,</HI> the
bedsteds are all of iron. This insect if it be crushed
or bruised emits a most horrid and loathsome scent,
so that those that are bitten by them are often in a
doubt whether it be better to endure the trouble of
their bitings, or kill them and suffer their most odi∣ous
and abminable stink. We have of these insects
in some places of <HI>England,</HI> but not many, neither
are they troublesome to us.</P>
<P>We departed from <HI>Trent</HI> intending for <HI>Coira</HI> or
<HI>Chur</HI> in the <HI>Grisons</HI> Countrey called in Latine <HI>curia
Rhaetorum.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">March 18.</NOTE> We rode up the valley wherein the river
<HI>Athesis</HI> runs, called <HI>Val Venosta,</HI> every 5 miles pas∣sing
through a large village, and one handsome lit∣tle
town called <HI>Burgo,</HI> and lodged at a small place
called <HI>Brunsole.</HI></P>
<P>We rode through <HI>Bolzan</HI> considerable Town and
for bigness comparable to <HI>Trent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">19. Bolzan. Maran.</NOTE> and 10 miles fur∣ther
<HI>Maran</HI> a large Town, and lodged at a village
called <HI>Raveland.</HI></P>
<P>We passed through <HI>Latourn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE> <HI>Slach, Schlanders,
Maltz,</HI> all villages and Towns of note, and last of all
<HI>Cleurn</HI> a pretty great walled Town, and then struck
up on the left hand among the mountains to a village
called <HI>Tavers</HI> where we lodged.</P>
<P>We rode on through the snow to <HI>Monastero,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE> where
the <HI>Grisons</HI> Countrey begins, and S. <HI>Maria</HI> a small
<HI>terra,</HI> and stopt at <HI>Gherf</HI> a village at the foot of the
<PB N="412" REF="219"/>
high mountains. In this Countrey the people use a
peculiar language of their own, which they call
<HI>Romansch,</HI> that is <HI>Lingua Romana.</HI> It seems to be
nearer <HI>Spanish</HI> than <HI>Italian,</HI> though distinct from
both. Besides their own language they generally
speak both <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Dutch:</HI> so that after we had
lost <HI>Italian</HI> in the valleys we wondered to find it
heer again among the hills. Their wines they bring
all out of the <HI>Valtelline,</HI> from <HI>Tirano,</HI> about 2 days
journey distant. The Countrey at this time was all
over covered with snow, so that they are fain to
keep their cattel within doors for six months! yet
the people said that heerabouts the snow did not lie
all Summer, no not on the tops of the highest moun∣tains.
Heer we ob∣served that to draw their sleds over
the snow, instead of Oxen they make use of Bulls,
one Bull drawing a little sled. About <HI>Tavers</HI> we observed
them sowing of dust upon the snow, which
they told us was to make the snow melt sooner: I
suppose it was rather for manure. They use stoves in
all places, and good reason they have the Countrey
being so cold, A great number of <HI>Chamois</HI> or <HI>Gemps
[Rupicaprae</HI>] are taken all over these Countries upon
the high hills, as, though the people had not told us,
we must needs have gathered from the multitude of
horns we saw stuck up in the houses where we lodg∣ed.
Bears there are and Wolves among the high
mountains but not many. The men generally wear
ruffs and long bushy beards. All the people (as far as
we had experience or could judge of them in the
short stay we made among them) we found to be ho∣nest,
hearty and civil, and the common sort very
mannerly. Their houses are built of stone, and co∣vered
with shingles of wood, the walls thick and the
windows very small to fence against the cold. They
have no strong holds or fortified places among them;
nor will they permit any to be erected; having so
much confidence in their own valour, that they
<PB N="413" REF="219"/>
think they need no other defence: indeed their
Countrey is such as one would think none of their
neighbouring Princes should covet unless for the
security of his own Territories.</P>
<P>We passed the Mountain of <HI>Bufalora</HI> in 7 or 8
hours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE> In the top of the Mountain, in the mid way
between <HI>Cherf</HI> and <HI>Zernetz,</HI> is an Inn called <HI>Furno.</HI>
From <HI>Zernetz</HI> we rode in the Valley of the higher
<HI>Engadine</HI> through <HI>Zuotz</HI> a great <HI>terra,</HI> and two o∣ther

<HEAD>OF THE
GRISONS.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Grisons</HI> are divided into 3 Leagues, and each
League subdivided into <HI>Communes:</HI> each <HI>com∣mune</HI>
contains several Villages; not all an equal
number, but some more some fewer. The <HI>Lega
Grisa</HI> (according to <HI>Simler</HI>) hath <HI>19 Communes.</HI> The
<HI>Lega della casa Dio</HI> hath 21 <HI>Communes,</HI> which are
sometimes contracted into 11. <HI>Cleurn, Tavers</HI> and
<HI>Maltz</HI> have sately revolted from this League, and
put themselves under the Archduke of <HI>Inspruck.</HI> The
<HI>Dieci Dritture</HI> have ten, as the name imports. Each
<HI>Commune</HI> hath its annual chief Magistrate, whom
in some places they call <HI>Maestrale,</HI> and a certain num∣ber
of Assessors or Judges, which in their language
are called <HI>Truoeder.</HI> Each <HI>terra</HI> or Village chuses its
Judges by majority of votes. [Sometimes the Peo∣ple
chuse only a certain number of Delegates, which
Delegates are to make choice of the Judges.] All
the People, as well rich as poor, as well Servants as
Masters, have their Suffrages so soon as they come
to the age of 16 years. The time of their Election
is <HI>St. Matthias</HI> day. The <HI>Commune</HI> of <HI>Engadina alta</HI>

some one, some two, according to their bigness.
[In other Communities the several <HI>terre</HI> have the

every year, and may be put out by the People if
<PB N="415" REF="220"/>
they please. The <HI>Maestrale</HI> (called in some places
<HI>Landamman</HI>) is the chief, and assembles the <HI>Truoeder</HI>
together, makes Processes, and in sum hath the
executive power. When they have occasion to meet
to decide any business, or judge in any criminal
cause, he that is cast or condemned, if he hath goods
bears the charges, if he hath none then the <HI>Com∣mune</HI>
bears the charges; So that every <HI>Commune</HI> is a
Common-wealth by its self, and its government
purely Democratical. Every two years they have
two Diets or general Councils: The first Diet
(when the Officers which they send to their seve∣ral
<HI>Praefecturae</HI> are elected) is at <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> the se∣cond
(when they take an account of their Officers)
is on <HI>St. John Baptists</HI> day. To these Diets each
<HI>Commune</HI> sends its Delegates, <HI>Messi</HI> they call them,
or Commissioners, some one and some two. These
Delegates must act according to the instructions gi∣ven
them by their several Communities. Each
League hate its Head or Chief. The Burgomaster of
<HI>Coira</HI> is always Head of the League <HI>della casa di Dio.</HI>
In the <HI>Lega Grisa</HI> there are four Communities that
by ancient custom have the Head (who is here cal∣led
<HI>Landtreichter</HI>) by turns. In the <HI>Dieci Dritture</HI>
six Communities have the choice of the Chief, who
is called <HI>Landamman.</HI> Those six <HI>Communes</HI> send
each its Delegate to <HI>Tavas,</HI> and the Delegates by the
major vote chuse the new <HI>Landamman.</HI> These some∣times
with some assistants meet as a lesser Council,
but have no absolute or decisive sentence. There
lies an Appeal from the general Diet to the Com∣munities,
and what the major part of those con∣cludes
or agrees upon is valid. The <HI>Grisons</HI> pay no
sort of Datii, Gabels or Taxes. In <HI>Italy</HI> the Coun∣ty
of <HI>Chiavenna</HI> and the <HI>Valtelline</HI> are subject to the
<HI>Grisons.</HI> To the County of <HI>Chiavena</HI> they sent for∣merly
two Podesta's or Bailifls, one to <HI>Plurs,</HI> which
Town was miserably destroyed by the falling of a
<PB N="416" REF="221"/>
Mountain upon it, and one to <HI>Chiavena,</HI> who is cal∣led
<HI>Commissario.</HI> Near <HI>Plurs</HI> are made Pots and Ves∣of stone turned after the manner of wood, which
will endure the fire. The <HI>Valtelline</HI> according to
<HI>Simler</HI> is divided into six <HI>Praefecturae,</HI> whether the
<HI>Grisons</HI> send <HI>Podesta's</HI> or Governors. Those are <HI>Bor∣mio,</HI>
which some make a County by it self, <HI>Tirano,
Tellio, Sondrio, Morbegno</HI> and <HI>Travona.</HI> They named
to us two more, <HI>viz. Ponte</HI> and <HI>Chiur.</HI> These <HI>Pode∣sta's</HI>
are changed every two years, the principal or
head of them is the Prefect of <HI>Sondrio,</HI> who is not
called <HI>Podesta,</HI> but <HI>Governatore</HI> as we were told, as
<HI>Simler</HI> saith <HI>Capitaneo.</HI> In the chusing of Praefects
the order both of the Leagues and of the Commu∣nities
is observed. So that for example, if the <HI>Lega
Grisa</HI> chuses the Governor of <HI>Sondrio</HI> for this two
years, the <HI>Lega della casa di Dio</HI> shall have the choice
of him the next two, and the <HI>Dieci Dritture</HI> the
following. The like order is observed in the seve∣ral
Communities of each League. The People of
<HI>Valtelline,</HI> the Country of <HI>Bormio,</HI> and the County of
<HI>Chiavenna</HI> pay no Taxes or Gabels more than for
the maintenance of their Governors or <HI>Podesta's.</HI></P>
<P>We left <HI>Ponte,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 24.</NOTE> and passed over another high
Mountain called in a very bad season,
for that it snowed exceeding fast all the while we
were abroad, which in many places so filled up the
track that we could see no way at all, only we could
presently find when were out, for then our hor∣ses
were almost up to the belly in snow: besides a
brisk gale of most bitter cutting wind blew just in
our faces, which did so affect my eyes that I could
not open tem without great pain for three days,
nor easily endure to look upon snow for a great
while after. The reason why my eyes were more
affected than others I conceive was, because I was
not careful to wipe the snow off my face, but suffer∣ed
it to freez to the hair of my eyebrows and eye∣lids:
<PB N="417" REF="221"/>
the cold whereof being contiguous to them,
stupified, and would in time have quite mortified
my eyes. And here by the way we may take notice,
that the People living in this mountainous cold
Country look more swarthy and dusky, at least their
their faces and parts exposed to the air, and have
not so good complexions as those that live below
in a milder and more temperatre Region. It is an
observation of <HI>Bodin</HI> in his <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>History,</HI> That
the Inhabitants of the temperate Zone, as you go
further and further from the Tropic are still whi∣ter
and whiter, till you come to a certain degree of
latitude, and then they grow dusky and dark-co∣loured
again; 3 witness the <HI>Greenlanders, Laplanders;
&amp;c.</HI> extremity of cold parching and tanning the
skin as well as excess of heat. And we found this
true by our own experience; for our faces were so
hackt and burnt (if I may take so to use that
word) by the cold in our passage over these Moun∣tains,
that for some time after we lookt like so ma∣ny
Gypsics. This night we lodged in a <HI>terra</HI> called
<HI>Bergun.</HI></P>
<P>We went on to <HI>Coira</HI> the capital City of the <HI>Gri∣sons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">25. Coira or Chur.</NOTE>
a pretty little Town standing on a small River
that falls into the <HI>Rhene,</HI> about half a mile below,
environed almost with Mountains, save only on that
side the River <HI>Rhene</HI> runs; where there is a pleasant
Valley, having very good Meadow and Pasture
grounds. The Inhabitants of <HI>Coira</HI> are all Prote∣stants,
excepting the Bishop (who coyns money that
is current here) and 24 Canons. The Bishop hath
nothing at all to do in the Government of the
Town. The form of Government is much like that
of <HI>Zurich</HI> and <HI>Basel, viz.</HI> the Citizens are divided
into sive Tribes or Companies, each of which chuses
14 Senators, which make up the great Council of 70.
These are called <HI>Ratsheren,</HI> and are chosen by
the people anew every year on <HI>S. Martins</HI> day; a∣new
<PB N="418" REF="222"/>
I say, for the same are usually chosen again so
long as they live. Out of this greater Council are
chosen yearly of each Tribe sive into the lesser Coun∣cil,
to which are added the 5 Masters of the Com∣panies
for the last year, who make up the number
of 30. Half these are called Senators, and govern the
Common-wealth. The chief Officers who preside in
the Senate are the two Burgomasters who rule al∣ternately,
one one year, the other the next. The
Council of 30, with the regent Burgomaster, who
is called <HI>Stativo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht,</HI> judge in criminal causes, Be∣sides
there is a Bench of Judges made up of the five
Masters of the Companies, and ten out of the Coun∣cil
of 30, wherein the Praetor of the City called
<HI>Stattrichter</HI> presides, which determines civil con∣troversies
and actions of debt. But from them there
lies an Appeal to the Council of 30.</P>
<P>In the mountanous Pastures about this Town we
observed growing plentifully <HI>Crocus vernus flore albo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants observed about Coira.</NOTE>
<HI>&amp; flo. Caeruleo, &amp; flo. ex albo. &amp; caerulco variegato;
Hepatica nobilis ubique; Leucoium bulbosum Tab. &amp;
Ornithogalum flore luteo.</HI> Besides <HI>Coira</HI> the <HI>Grisons</HI>
have two little Towns which they call Cities, <HI>May∣field</HI>
and <HI>Eylandts.</HI> For their Religion the <HI>Grisons</HI>
are divided; some Communities being <HI>Romanists,</HI>
some Protestants; but most Protestants, of whom
they told us there were in all the Country about
17000 fighting men.</P>
<P>We travelled from <HI>Coira</HI> to <HI>Walenstat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 29. 1665. Walen∣stat.</NOTE> situate be∣side
a small Lake, thence called <HI>Walenstatter-Sea:</HI>
passing by the way through <HI>Mayfield, Ragats,</HI> and
<HI>Sargans.</HI> Both <HI>Sargans</HI> and <HI>Walenstat</HI> are <HI>Voghtia's</HI>
or <HI>Praefecturae</HI> belonging the seven Cantons.</P>
<P>We ferried over the Lake to <HI>Wesen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">30 Glaris.</NOTE> and from
<HI>Wesen</HI> rode to <HI>Glaris,</HI> one of the 13 Cantons of
<HI>Switzerland.</HI> Heer we saw the horns of the <HI>Ibex,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Steinbuck or Ibex.</NOTE>
(which they call <HI>Steinbuck.</HI>) They are somewhat like
to Goats horns, but larger. They told us that there
<PB N="419" REF="222"/>
were none of these beasts found heerabouts, but
that in <HI>Wallisland,</HI> and in the Archbishoprick of
<HI>Saltzburgh</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> there were of them. But
of the <HI>Rupicaprae</HI> or <HI>Gimpses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chamois <HI>or</HI> Gemps.</NOTE> and <HI>Mures Alpini ma∣jores,</HI>
called <HI>Marmottoes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marmot∣toes.</NOTE> they have good store. Of
birds they have in plenty <HI>Merulae torquatae,</HI> which
they call <HI>Ringer-Amzel; Merulae aquaticae,</HI> which
they call <HI>Wasser-amzel; Vrogallus,</HI> or <HI>Cock of the
wood, Lagopus,</HI> a milk white bird somewhat bigger
than a <HI>Partridge,</HI> feathered down to the very toes
and claws, of the <HI>Heath-cock</HI> kind, but more of these
in the <HI>Grisons</HI> Country, where they brought them
us to sell. The people of this Canton of <HI>Glaris,</HI>
as also <HI>Appenzel,</HI> are mixt, two third parts Prote∣stants
and one third Roman-Catholics. They both
make use of the same Church for their several Ser∣vices:
first the Priest comes and does Mass, then
the Minister and preaches.</P>
<P>The Governments of the several Cantos of <HI>Swit∣zerland</HI>
may be reduced to three forms or heads.
The first is of those Cantons which have no Cities,
whose chief Officer is called <HI>Landamman;</HI> and in
these the supreme power is in all the People, by
whose counsel all businesses of moment are decided.
Of this sort are <HI>Vri, Suits, Vnderwalden, Zug, Glaris</HI>
and <HI>Appenzel.</HI> The second, of those which have
Cities that were either built by, or sometime sub∣ject
to Princes, whose chief Officer is called <HI>Scul∣tetus</HI>
or Scout: This form is most Aristocratical of
all others; and of this sort are <HI>Bern, Lucern, Fri∣burg,</HI>
and <HI>Solothurn.</HI> The third, of those which have
Cities divided into several Tribes or Companies,
by whose suffrages the Magistrates are yearly cho∣sen;
of this Order are <HI>Zurich, Basel,</HI> and <HI>Schaff∣hausse.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="canton">
<PB N="420" REF="223"/>
<HEAD>GLARIS</HEAD>
<P>Is divided (according to <HI>Similer</HI>) into 15 parts,
but as we were told there into 12 Parishes, of which
some have five Counsellors, some six; some more
some less, according to their bigness. These make
up the Senate or Council, which consists of 60,
whereof two parts are of the reformed Religion and
one of the <HI>Romish,</HI> besides the <HI>Landamman</HI> and o∣ther
cheif Officers, who have the privilege of sit∣ting
in Council when their term is expired. The
chief and supreme power is in the whole people.
Upon the last Sunday in <HI>April</HI> yearly there is a ge∣neral
Convention of all the males above 16 years of
age, together with the Magistrates at a place called
<HI>Schuandan.</HI> This general Meeting or Convention
is called <HI>Landtskmein:</HI> and by these by majority of
Sussrages the Magistrates and Officers are chosen;
and first the <HI>Landamman,</HI> who continues in Office
sometimes two, sometimes three years. Into this
Office they may choose out of all the people whom
they please without any regard of place. 2. The
<HI>Statthalter</HI> who is the <HI>Landammans</HI> Lieutenant.
These Offices in the Canton are thus divided be∣tween
the Protestants and Papists. Three years the
<HI>Landamman</HI> is a Protestant, and the <HI>Statthalter</HI> a Papist; then the two following the <HI>Landamman</HI> is
a Papist and the <HI>Statthalter</HI> a Protestant. 3. The
<HI>Seckelmeister</HI> or Treasurer. 4. <HI>Pannerheer</HI> or Stan∣dard-bearer.
5. <HI>Landshauptman</HI> or chief Captain, and
under him in time of war Lieutenant. 6. <HI>Landts∣fendricht</HI>
or Ensign. These three last continue for
life. 7. Three <HI>Landtschrieben, i. e.</HI> Secretaries or
Chancellours, who are present in Council, but have
no suffrages. 8. <HI>Landtweible</HI> or Apparitour; he
gathers the votes in the general Convention, sum∣mons
the Council by Proclamation in the Church,
<PB N="421" REF="223"/>
&amp;c. The <HI>Landscmein</HI> chuses also the <HI>Landtvogts</HI> or
Prefects, and either confirms or abrogates public
Edicts and Constitutions. The 60 Senatours usu∣ally
continue in office during life <HI>modo bene se gesserint,</HI>
yet are they yearly chosen anew or confirmed
at the general Convention, not by the whole Con∣vention,
but each one by that part of Parish to which
he belongs, and by which he was chosen; who al∣so
when any one dies chuse another into his place.
The <HI>Landamman</HI> when his office is expired is called
old <HI>Landamman,</HI> and may still sit in council, which
is a favour allowed him in regard of his former
dignity. The aforementioned Officers do also sit in
council. The <HI>Landamman</HI> puts men in prison by his
Authority, propounds business to the Council, ap∣points
the days of the Councils meeting, and to that
end appoints the Officer to give them notice in the
Church. In this Canton, to avoid the ambition and
inordinate expences of Candidates for Offices, who
were wont to court and feast the people, they have
lately introduced Lottery in the choice of Officers
and Governours. All the Candidates are first put to
the vote, and those eight (if there be so many for
any one place) who have most surages are set in the
middle. Then the <HI>Landtschrieb</HI> or Secretary takes
eight balls, one of which is gilt, and wraps them
up in single papers, and puts them into a hat which
he holds under his arm, whilst a little child puts in
his hand and takes out the balls one by one, and
gives them to the eight. He who happens to have
the gilt ball is the Officer. Besides these Councils
there are also two Consistories of Judges; one con∣sisting
of nine, chosen by the <HI>Landtskmein</HI> out of the
Council or <HI>Ratsheeren,</HI> to whom the <HI>Landamman</HI>
is added as President, who determine all causes of
injuries, and all business of inheritances, and where
money is gained with hazard of life: the other con∣sisting
of five who determine actions of debt. These
<PB N="422" REF="224"/>
Consistories (saith <HI>Simler</HI>) sit only in <HI>May</HI> and
<HI>September.</HI> Private quarrels by consent of the parties
are usually referred to a Councellour of the Parish.
To the general Died at <HI>Baden</HI> the Reformed send
the <HI>Landamman</HI> when he is a Protestant, and the
Roman Catholics the <HI>Statthalter,</HI> and so <HI>vice versa.</HI></P>
<P>The Territory of <HI>Glaris</HI> is about eight hours
long, that is allowing 3 <HI>English</HI> miles to an hour,
24 miles: The number of Freemen of both Reli∣gions
about 2500. This Canton hath one <HI>Vogtia</HI>
or Bayliewick proper to it self, that is <HI>Werdenburg,</HI>
to which every three years they send a new <HI>Landt∣vogt</HI>
or Prefect, who is Protestant.</P>
<P>In the Cantons of <HI>Basel, Zurich, Bern, Lucern,
Schaffhausse, Triburg</HI> and <HI>Soloturn,</HI> the Citizens only
are Freemen, and the Territory or Country round
about will all the Towns therein are Subjects, and
divided into several Bayliwicks or <HI>Praefecturae,</HI>
(<HI>Vogties</HI> they call them) to every of which the Ci∣ties
send a <HI>Bayliff</HI> or <HI>Landtvogt,</HI> who is Governour
there, whom they change in some Cantons every
second, in some every third, in some every sixth year.
In the other Cantons where there are no Cities, all
the Countrymen inhabiting the Canton, properly
so called, are freemen; I say the Canton properly
so called; for these also have their Subjects, whom
they govern likewise by their Prefects or Landt∣vogts.
Besides the proper there are also common
Praefectures or <HI>Vogties,</HI> some to two, some to three,
some to seven, some to twelve, and some to all
the Cantons: to which the Cantons concerned by
course send their <HI>Landtvogts.</HI> To the 12 Cantons
(<HI>Appenzel</HI> is the excluded) belong the 4 <HI>Italian
Praefecturae,</HI> which they obtained by the donation of
<HI>Maximilian Sforze</HI> Duke of <HI>Milan, An. 1513. viz.
Lugano, Logarno, Mendriz</HI> and <HI>Val Madia.</HI> To the
7 Cantons, that is <HI>Zurich, Lucern, Suitz, Vri, Vn∣derwald,
<PB N="423" REF="224"/>
Glaris</HI> and <HI>Zug,</HI> belong <HI>Baden, Liberae Pro∣vinciae,</HI>

<HI>Turgow;</HI> to these 7 and <HI>Appenzel</HI> belongs <HI>Rhineck</HI>
or <HI>Rheinthall.</HI> To the 3 Cantons, <HI>i. e. Vri, Suitz,</HI>
and <HI>Vnderwald</HI> belongs <HI>Bellinzona</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> whose
Territory is divided into three Bayliwicks, to which
those three Cantons send Landvogts by course, viz.
<HI>Bellinzona, Val Palensa</HI> and <HI>Riviera.</HI> To the two
Cantons of <HI>Suitz</HI> and <HI>Glaris</HI> belong <HI>Vznach</HI> and
<HI>Wesent,</HI> or <HI>Castra Rhoetica.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Glaris</HI> they told us, that in their own Coun∣trey
those of the Canton of <HI>Suitz</HI> were good Sol∣diers,
but living most upon milk and white meats,
they could not last and endure abroad. That those
of <HI>Vri, Appenzel,</HI> and the lower part of <HI>Glaris</HI> made
the best Soldiers of all.</P>
<P>We travelled from <HI>Glaris</HI> through <HI>Nafels</HI> a little
Village,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 1.</NOTE> and several other Villages near the Lake of
<HI>Rappersville</HI> or the <HI>Zurich-sea,</HI> especially <HI>Lachen,</HI>
where they usually take boat for <HI>Zurich,</HI> and after
an hours riding by the Lakes side, and in sight of
<HI>Rappersvill,</HI> and the long Bridge cross the Lake, we
climb'd up a very high Mountain on our left
hand, to the top of which when we were ascended
we rode throogh a Country all covered with snow,
which in the Summer time seems to be a very plea∣sant
place. Heer we found <HI>Eynsidle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eynsidle.</NOTE> where is a famous
Monastery of <HI>Benedictine</HI> Freres, in whose Church is
an Image of our Lady, which works great miracles,
<HI>si credere fus sit.</HI> This is a place of great devotion,
visited by Strangers and Pilgrims after the manner
of <HI>Loreto.</HI> And as there is the <HI>Holy house,</HI> so here is
a <HI>Chappel divinely consecrated,</HI> set in the body of the
Church, and enclosed in a case of Marble, given by
an Archbishop of <HI>Saltzburg.</HI> Near the door of this
Church is an Alley of Shops of Beads and Medals,
as at <HI>Loreto;</HI> and here as there an incredible number
of Beggers continually waiting. The Canton of
<PB N="424" REF="225"/>
<HI>Switz</HI> is Protector of his Abbey. If any one desire
to know more of this place he may consult the Hi∣story
of it, entitled (as I remember) <HI>Sanctae Virginis Eynsiddlensis.</HI></P>
<P>We rode again over the snow for about three
hours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Schwytz.</NOTE> and then descending by degrees we passed
through three Villages, and at last arrived at <HI>Swyts,</HI>
a fair Village (for its counted no other, though it be
comparable to the best of our Market Towns) ha∣ving
a large <HI>Piazza</HI> handsomely paved.</P>
<P>The government of this Canton is much what
the same with that of <HI>Glaris.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernment of the Canton of Suitz.</NOTE> The whole Canton
is divided into 6 parts or quarters. Each division
hath 10 Counsellors; so that the Council or Se∣nate
consists of 60, which they call <HI>Ratsheeren.</HI> When
a Senatour dies, that quarter to which he belonged
chuses another by the major vote of all the people.
Every quarter hath its head, who is called <HI>Siebener:</HI>
because they are seven in all, the <HI>Landamman</HI> ma∣king
one of the number; which make a lesser Coun∣cil
to manage and take care of the public revenue.
The Senatours are obliged in important causes to
take each his man to be his assistant, and in the most
weighty of all (as concerning peace and war) each
two men; so that then the Council is tripled. The
last Sunday of <HI>April</HI> (as at <HI>Glaris</HI>) is the Conven∣tion
of the whole Canton called the <HI>Landtskmein,</HI>
when all the males above 16 years of age meet and
elect by major vote the <HI>Landamman</HI> and other Offi∣cers
and <HI>Landvogts.</HI> To this meeting all the people
that can conveniently are obliged to come; and eve∣ry
one to swear fidelity to their Countrey, to main∣tain
their Liberties, &amp;c. The Officers are the same
as at <HI>Glaris.</HI> This Canton and every one of the rest
send two <HI>Messi</HI> to the general Diet at <HI>Baden,</HI> of
which the <HI>Landamman</HI> is usually one. This Canton
hath also the like two little Councils or Consistories
as <HI>Glaris.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="225"/>
We rode about 3 miles to a place called <HI>Brunen,</HI>
beside the lake of <HI>Lucern,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Altorff.</NOTE> and there embarkt for <HI>Al∣torf,</HI>
spending in our passage upon the water about
3 hours, and then we had but a mile to the town.
From <HI>Swytz</HI> to <HI>Altorf</HI> there is no travelling by land
(as they told us) unless we would go some scores of
miles about. <HI>Altorf</HI> hath no piazza, yet is it a larger
town than <HI>Schwytz,</HI> and hath a pretty Church and
a Monastery of <HI>Capucines.</HI> Heer we heard at large
related to us the story of <HI>William Tell</HI> and the <HI>Lant∣vogt,</HI>
which he that is desirous to know may con∣sult
<HI>Simler.</HI> On the top of a pillar over one of their
fountains in the street is set the statue of this <HI>Tell,</HI>
with his cross-bow on his shoulder, and leading his
son by the hand. At some distance stands a tower
on which are painted the several passages of the
Story.</P>
<P>The Government is almost the same with that of
<HI>Schwytz.</HI> The number of Senators, manner of
their election the same. The Officer and Magi∣strates
the same, only they mentioned a <HI>Suk-heer,</HI>
who hath the charge of the Ammunition, whom
they told us not of in other Cantons, and 6 Fier∣sprachts,
i. e. Proctors or Councellors, but not of
the Council. The Senatours being to judge in cri∣minal
causes take to them another man, so that then
the Council is doubled. They have also a lesser
Council of 15 called the <HI>Landtram,</HI> which decides
civil causes. These are taken out of the great Coun∣cil,
and go round in a <HI>rota.</HI> They meet the first
Munday every moneth. A third Council also they
have called the <HI>Poderade,</HI> which sits weekly about
actions of debt where the sum exceeds not 60 li∣vers.
The Senators (as they told us) have no Salary
or allowance at all. When one of the Council is
chosen <HI>Landtvogt</HI> he is put out of the Council. <HI>Vri</HI>
is the first Canton that set it self at liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="226"/>
We returned to the lake of <HI>Lucern,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">April 4. Vnder∣walden.</NOTE> and taking
boat we went by water within one hour of <HI>Stantz,</HI>
the principal village of <HI>Vnderwald,</HI> where we lodg∣ed.
As we sailed upon this lake we happened to see
a great fall of snow from the tops of some moun∣tains
hanging over the lake, which made a ratling
and report not unlike thunder, as Monsieur <HI>de Cartes</HI>
in his Meteors notes. At <HI>Stantz</HI> they have a very
fair Church, and two Convents, one of <HI>Capucine</HI>
Freres, and one of Muns. Heer and at <HI>Altorf, Switz,
Lucern,</HI> &amp;c. we observed in the Church-yards crosses
set upon the graves, some of wood, some of iron,
and on some of them hanging a little copper kettle
with holy water in it. Some women we saw com∣ing
with a bunch of herbs in their hands, which
they dipped in the kettle, and sprinkled the water
therewith upon the graves. These I suppose were
Widows or Mothers who sprinkled the water upon
the graves of their dead Husbands or Children.</P>
<P>This Canton is divided into two parts, <HI>Oberwald</HI>
or the upper, whose capital village is <HI>Stanner,</HI> and
the lower or <HI>Vnderwald,</HI> the head whereof is <HI>Stantz.</HI>
In the lower are 60 Senatours chosen by 11 <HI>Commu∣nes,</HI>
some whereof have more, and some fewer, ac∣cording
to their bigness. The Officers are the same,
and chosen in like manner as in <HI>Schwytz</HI> and <HI>Vri,</HI>
only the <HI>Landamman</HI> and <HI>Statthalter</HI> continue in of∣fice
but one year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lantweible</HI> or Apparitor and 7 Judges, cho∣sen
one out of a <HI>Commune,</HI> judge in civil causes.
From these there is an appeal to another Tribunal
of 11, consisting of the <HI>Landamman,</HI> and one ele∣cted
out of each <HI>Commune</HI> save tat the <HI>Landam∣man</HI>
is of. These 11 are chosen out of the Council,
the seven indifferently. In capital causes the Coun∣cil
of 60 Judges, and besides any one of the Coun∣trey
may be present and give his suffrage if he plea∣ses,
though ordinarily none do but the Senators,
<PB N="427" REF="226"/>
who are all there to by oath obliged. The Senators
and Officers of this Canton have all salaries. Heer
and in <HI>Vri</HI> all the males of all conditions that are
14 years old and upward have their suffrages at the
<HI>Landtskmeind. Oberwald</HI> hath likewise a Council,
<HI>Landamman</HI> and other Officers by themselves, in∣deed
nothing common with <HI>Vnderwald.</HI> They no∣minate
<HI>Landvogts</HI> and Embassadors by turns. They
might be esteemed two Cantons were it not for that
they have but two Delegates at the Diet at <HI>Baden,</HI>
as the other Cantons have.</P>
<P>These three Cantons, <HI>Vti, Switz,</HI> and <HI>Vnderwald,</HI>
consist chiefly, not to say wholly, of pasture ground:
No cornfields or vineyards heer. Their wine is
imported from <HI>Italy,</HI> their corn from several parts.
They boast that by this means their ground is not
so subject to the casualties of weather, or injuries of
bad seasons as either plowed fields or vineyards,
and yields to the owners a more certain profit.
It's well if one reason why they maintain all their
ground pasture, be not because they are unwilling to
take pains in husbandry. Wine is dear heer. At
<HI>Altorf</HI> and <HI>Stantz</HI> they have it from <HI>Logarno.</HI> At
<HI>Switz</HI> they have both <HI>Valtelline</HI> and <HI>Logarno</HI>-wine.
The people are very honest and good natured, keep
their houses neat and cleanly, and withal very po∣lite
and in good repair. The men are given much to
drinking. The meat stands before them three or
four hours, and they now and then cat a bit, but
the main business is drinking.</P>
<P>We travelled to <HI>Lucern,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">April. 5. Lucern.</NOTE> crossing over a part of the
lake. This is a very neat city and pleasantly situate
upon the lake: divided into parts by a river which
runs out of the lake; over which there are three
bridges, one for carts and horses, the other two
handsome foot bridges covered over with a roof or
penthouse, one near a quarter of a mile long. Be∣sides
there is a fourth bridge which leads towards
<PB N="428" REF="227"/>
the Church covered like this last, and longer than it.
The great Church stands without the city wall,
a very handsome tall, and lightsome structure. O∣ver
the Western door is the greatest Organ that ever
I saw: A man might very well creep into the hol∣low
of the greater pipes of it. The account of the
Government that was given us heer was much dif∣ferent
from <HI>Simlers.</HI> They told us that the Great
Council consisted of 136, whereas he writes that it
consists of no more that 100: but these may be re∣conciled;
for that, I suppose, he excludes the lesser
Council, which they included. They continue in
office during life; and when one dies, the rest of
the Council chuse another into his place, out of the
Citizens whom they think fit. <HI>Simler</HI> saith that the
lesser Council of the last half year chuse the new
Senators. This Council hath two Presidents whom
they call <HI>Sculteti,</HI> who preside <HI>alternis annis,</HI> and
continue in office during life. <HI>Simler</HI> saith they are
chosen yearly by the Suffrages of both the Councils.
The manner of chusing Officers and Senators is this.
Behind a curtain according to the number of Com∣petitors
are placed two, three, or more boxes. E∣very
Senator hath given him a little medal or piece
of money for that purpose; and so the Senators
go one by one behind the curtain, and put the
medal into what box they please, and he that
hath most of these pieces is understood to be cho∣sen.
Out of the great Council is chosen a lesser of
the most ancient and wise, who also continue du∣ring
life, and judge in civil causes, and take care
of the ordinary concerns of the City; and for that
purpose they sit daily. They are divided into two
equal parts, 18 for the Summer, and 18 for the
Winter. If one of the Winter dies, those of the Sum∣mer
elect one into his place out of the 100, and
<HI>vice versa.</HI> The great Council of 136 judge in cri∣minal
causes. Those of the lesser Council have five
<PB N="429" REF="227"/>
<HI>Batz</HI> [about 10 <HI>d.</HI> or 1 <HI>s. English</HI>] and those of the
great Council two Batz <HI>per diem</HI> for every day they
sit in Council. All the people of the territory of this
city are Subjects, and divided into 19 or 20 <HI>Proefe∣cturoe:</HI>
the number of fighting men about 18000.
The Subjects in time of peace pay no more tribute
than 5 Batz or a hen the man <HI>per annum</HI> to the
<HI>Lanivogt.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Lucern</HI> we travelled to <HI>Zugh</HI> called in <HI>Latine
Tugium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">April. 6. Zugh.</NOTE> about 15 miles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernment of the Canton of <HI>Zug.</HI></NOTE> This City is by one half
less than <HI>Lucern;</HI> it stands by the side of a little lake.
The Government of this Canton is popular like
those of <HI>Vri, Switz</HI> and <HI>Vnderwalden.</HI> Besides the
City there are 3 <HI>Communes</HI> which have an interest in
the government, <HI>viz. Eyry, Mensinguen</HI> and <HI>Baar.</HI>
They have a Council of 40 (as they told us there)
but according to <HI>Simler</HI> of 45; 9 out of each Com∣mune
and 18 out of the City. The 3 <HI>Communes</HI> have
the <HI>Landamman</HI> 6 years and the City 3. So that when
the <HI>Landamman</HI> is of a <HI>Commune</HI> he continues in
Office but two years, when of the City three years.
When one of the Council dies another is chosen in∣to
his place by major vote of all the males above 18
years of age of the City or that Community to which
he that died belonged. The Magistrates are the same
and elected in like manner as in <HI>Vri</HI> and <HI>Switz,</HI> &amp;c.
All the <HI>Praefecturae,</HI> (which are in number eight) be∣long
to the City only. The City together with its
subjects can arm 4000 Souldiers: the 3 Communi∣ties
not 2000. Yet are they obliged by ancient Con∣vention
to bear two third parts of the charge in case
there be nay war. In criminal causes they have 12
Judges taken out of the Council, 3 of the City and
3 of each Community. In civil the Senators judge
in their several Communities. To the general <HI>Diet</HI>
at <HI>Baden</HI> the City sends one and the three Commu∣nities
another. The nomination of the common
<HI>Lantvogts</HI> the City hath once and the Communities
<PB N="430" REF="228"/>
twice. When the <HI>Landamman</HI> is of the Communi∣ties
he is obliged during his Office to reside in the
City.</P>
<P>The lake of <HI>Zugh</HI> hath great variety of fish, more
then any other lake of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> if the people
there may be believed. They named to us <HI>Eels,
Carps, Perches, Trouts, Salmons,</HI> which is very strange,
there being no way for them to get thither but up the
<HI>Rhene,</HI> and so they must have a course of above 500
miles; and besides there being at <HI>Wasserfal</HI> a huge
Catarract of the whole river, which one would
think it were impossible to pass. <HI>Esch</HI> called by the <HI>Ita∣lians
Temelo,</HI> and in <HI>English Grayling, Trisea</HI> or <HI>Tra∣sine,</HI>
in <HI>English Eelpout, Pikes</HI> (of which we saw one
taken that weighed 30 pound) <HI>Weiss-fish</HI> or <HI>Alberlin,</HI>
called at <HI>Geneva Farra.</HI> This fish is taken in the lake
of <HI>Bala</HI> in <HI>Merionethshire</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> and there called
<HI>Guiniad</HI> from the whiteness of it: and in Huls-wa∣ter
near <HI>Pereth</HI> in <HI>Cumberland</HI> and there called <HI>Schel∣ley:
Hassler,</HI> which I take to be the <HI>Charre</HI> of <HI>Win∣andermere</HI>
in <HI>Westmerland,</HI> and the <HI>Torgoch</HI> of <HI>North∣wales:
Balla: Nase,</HI> called by Naturalists <HI>Nasus,
Breams, Crevises;</HI> and a great many sorts more to
the number of at least 50. In many of the shadowy
lanes we passed through about <HI>Stantz, Zug</HI> and else∣where
we observed growing plentifully <HI>Aublatum
Cordi</HI> or <HI>Dentaria aphyllos.</HI></P>
<P>We travelled from <HI>Zug</HI> to <HI>Zurich</HI> which is 5 good
hours riding.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 7. Zurich.</NOTE> But of that City we have already
written.</P>
<P>From <HI>Zurich</HI> we rode to <HI>Mellingen</HI> a free Town
not far from <HI>Baden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Mellin∣gen.</NOTE> 4 good leagues; and then
through a little walled Town belonging to the <HI>Ber∣nese</HI>
called <HI>Lensburgh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lens∣burg. Arauw.</NOTE> and lodged at <HI>Arauw</HI> a consi∣derable
Town upon the river <HI>Aar,</HI> subject also to the
<HI>Bernese,</HI> 4 short leagues.</P>
<P>We travelled a streight rode passing no consider∣able
Town till we arrived at <HI>Soloturn</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">14. Soloturn.</NOTE> 9 leagues di∣stant
<PB N="431" REF="228"/>
from <HI>Arauw.</HI> This though it be the head of a
Canton is no large Town, nor very considerable for
its strength.</P>
<P>We diverted out of the common rode to <HI>Geneva</HI>
to see <HI>Bern,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">15. Bern.</NOTE> 6 hours distant from <HI>Soloturn.</HI> This is
a handsome City, built all of stone, though the hou∣ses
be not tall. It hath one fair long street with nar∣row
portico's or Cloysters on each side. It lies stret∣ched
out in length upon a hill which I may call a <HI>Pe∣ninsula,</HI>
it is so almost begirt about with the river.
On that side where it is not com∣passed
with the river it is strongly fortified with
good bastions and outworks. The Founder of this
City as also of <HI>Friburg</HI> in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and <HI>Friburg</HI>
in <HI>Brisgoia</HI> was <HI>Berchtoldus</HI> Duke of <HI>Zerin;</HI> as ap∣pears
by the inscription upon their moneys. To him
they have erected a monument in the great Church.
This Church is one of the handsomest stone-fabrics
in all <HI>Switzerland.</HI></P>
<P>The territory of this City is more then on third
part of the Countrey of the <HI>Suisses,</HI> and is divided
into 60 <HI>Praefecturae</HI> or Bailyages, besides 4 which are
common to them with <HI>Friburg.</HI> For this reason there
must needs be many rich men in the City, though
they have but little trade. The <HI>Landtvogts</HI> or Bay∣liffs
continue in office 6 years, during which time
they enrich themselves well; yet do not their sub∣jects
complain, but acknowledge themselves well
used by their Governours. Heer they keep 5 or 6
Bears in a pit. These Bears I observed to climb the
firr-trees growing in the pit, and delighting to sit
on the tops of them like birds on a perch. The Arms
of the Town is also a Bear, which they took I sup∣pose
alluding to their name <HI>Bern:</HI> And they first
coyned the mony called Batzes from the figure of a
bear stamped upon it: which afterward all the Can∣tons
imitated, calling it also by the same name.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bern</HI> we rode to <HI>Friburg</HI> a handsome Town<NOTE PLACE="marg">17. Friburg.</NOTE>
<PB N="432" REF="229"/>
and the head of a Canton, built upon a hill almost
begirt with a river after the manner of <HI>Bern</HI> and by
the same Founder, on all sides environed with hills,
save where it is continuous to the land. Their terri∣tory
is surrounded with and enclosed in the territory
of <HI>Bern.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Friburg</HI> we travelled through <HI>Maulton</HI> to
<HI>Lausanna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">18. Lausan∣na. Morges.</NOTE> a great Town and an University, and
from <HI>Lausanna April 19.</HI> through <HI>Morges</HI> a large
Town, <HI>Rolle</HI> and <HI>Nion</HI> considerable Towns by the
lake of <HI>Geneva's</HI> side and <HI>Verfoy</HI> a little Town on the
lake near <HI>Geneva,</HI> belonging to the <HI>French,</HI> and came
to our lodging at <HI>Geneva,</HI> where we rested and so∣journed
near 3 months.</P>
<P>The Governments of <HI>Soloturn. Bern</HI> and <HI>Friburg</HI>
are much like that of <HI>Lucern.</HI> In <HI>Soloturn</HI> the num∣ber
of the lesser Council is 35, and of the greater
115. When one of the 35 dies, the 34 remaining
chuse one into his place out of the 115. When one
of the 115 dies or is advanced the rest chuse one in∣to
his place out of the number of the Citizens. In
<HI>Bern</HI> the greater Council consists of 200, and the
lesser (as we were told there) of 42, though <HI>Simler</HI>
makes them but 26. These Councils are chosen by
20 Electors and the <HI>Sculthess, viz.</HI> the four <HI>Signiferi</HI>
of the City and 16 whom they pick out of the whole
body of the Citizens and joyn with themselves. In
<HI>Friburg</HI> the lesser Council is of 24 and the greater of
200. When one of the lesser Council dies they chuse
one into his place out of the greater: and when one
of the greater dies or is removed the lesser (as I un∣derstood
them) chuse one into his place out of the
number of the Citizens. All these Cities have 2
<HI>Sculteti</HI> or Consuls who rule <HI>alternis annis.</HI> He that
desires a more full and particular account of the go∣vernment
of these Cities may consult <HI>Simler de Re∣pub.
Helvetiorum.</HI> Each of the Cantons have some
Saint or other to be their Patron and protector,
<PB N="433" REF="229"/>
whose image the popish Cantons set on the reverse of
their monies, <HI>v. g. S. Oswald</HI> a King of <HI>England</HI>
Protector of <HI>Zug.</HI> In their Church they have his re∣liques,
and have set up his image on horseback. The
Protestant Cantons are <HI>Zurich, Bern Basel, Sehaf∣hausse,</HI>
part of <HI>Glaris</HI> and part of <HI>Appenzel.</HI> That
which most frequently breeds differences a quar∣rels
among the Suitzers is the business of the com∣mon
<HI>vogties</HI> or Bailywicks. For most of these [I
mean the <HI>Dutch</HI> ones] being of the reformed reli∣gion
are oppressed and injured by the Popish <HI>Lant∣vogts,</HI>
the Protestant Cantons not knowing how ei∣ther
to help and relieve them or retaliate. For the
Popish Cantons being more in number than the Pro∣testants,
they send <HI>Lantvogts</HI> to these places twice to
the Protestants once. This one of the Ministers of
<HI>Zurich</HI> told me wad <HI>fundi sui calamitas,</HI> and occasion∣ed
the two late breaches among them. The <HI>Switzers</HI>
on each side are very stiff in their Religion; the Pa∣pists
not permitting or tolerating one Protestant, nor
the Protestants one Papist in their proper territories.
Though the Cantons adhering to the Church of
<HI>Rome</HI> are more in number, yet the reformed are
much the greater, besides that their land is better,
very like to ours in <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Romanists</HI> are ac∣counted
the better Souldiers, and good reason they
have, being more exercised in War, serving the
<HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Kings, as being of the same Re∣ligion.
Besides, the <HI>Zurichers</HI> who anciently had
the reputation for valour, are now much given to
merchandise and to accumulate riches, and so taken
off from martial studies and exercises. The <HI>Bernese</HI>
though they have far the greatest and best territory
of all (so that it's said they can arm as many men
as the Dutchy of <HI>Milan;</HI> send into the field 100000
Souldiers and yet leave enough at home to till the
land) yet have they no reputation for Souldiers; they
lost their credit quite in the late skirmish with the
<PB N="434" REF="230"/>
<HI>Lucernese,</HI> who account them rather <HI>Savoyards</HI> than
<HI>Switzers.</HI> All the Cantons of <HI>Switzerland</HI> coyn
money except <HI>Appenzel, Vnderwald</HI> and <HI>Glaris,</HI> of
which <HI>Glaris</HI> formerly hath coined though now it
doth not. All the Swizzers in general are very ho∣nest
people, king and civil to strangers. One may
travel their Countrey securely with a bag of gold in
his hand. When we came to out Inns they would be
troubled if we distrusted them so far às to take our
Portmanteau's into our lodging-chambers and not
leave them in the common dining rooms. They keep
their houses very clean and polite like our good
housewives in <HI>England.</HI> For plants, going from
<HI>Zurich</HI> to <HI>Mellingen</HI> we observed common <HI>Gooseberry</HI>
in the hedges and by the way-sides very plentifully,
and in some places <HI>Barberries. Sigillum Solomonis</HI> and
<HI>Herba Paris</HI> are the most common plants that grow
in this Countrey in the woods and hedges every
where: <HI>Anonymus flore Coluteae</HI> on the mountains
near <HI>Zurich.</HI> From <HI>Arauw</HI> to <HI>Soloturn Helleboraster
maximus</HI> out he hills sides, as also <HI>Christophoriana,</HI>
not to mention <HI>Fumaria Bulbosa</HI> every where grow∣ing
in the shady lanes.</P>
<P><HI>Geneva</HI> is pleasantly seated at the lower end of the
<HI>Lacus Lemanus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Geneva.</NOTE> now called <HI>Genffer-zee</HI> or the lake
of <HI>Geneva,</HI> upon a hill side respecting the lake; so
that from the lake you have a fair prospect of the
whole Town. It is divided by the river <HI>Rhodanus</HI> or
<HI>Rhosne</HI> into two parts, which are joyned together by
two wooden bridges, one of which hath on each
side a row of houses after the manner of <HI>London∣bridge,</HI>
only they are low. The two principal and
indeed only considerable streets in the Town are the
low street [<HI>Rüe bas</HI>] which runs along by the river
and lakes side: and the high street or great street
[<HI>Rüe grand</HI>] which runs up the hill. The City is
indifferently strong, and they have lately been at
great expences to fortific it <HI>alla moderna</HI> with ram∣parts
<PB N="435" REF="230"/>
and bastions of earth. Though it be but small
yet is it very populous, being supposed to contain
30000 souls, St. <HI>Peter's</HI> Church, formerly the Ca∣thedral,
is handsome and well-built, and in it
is a stately monument for the Duke of <HI>Rohan.</HI> The
Citizens are very busie and industrious, subsisting
chiefly by trading: the whole territory of this Re∣public
being not so great as some one Noblemans
estate in <HI>England</HI> for extent of land. All provisions
of victuals are very plentiful and cheap at <HI>Geneva,</HI>
especially milk-meats, the neighbouring mountains
feeding abundance of cattel.</P>
<P>The tops of <HI>Jura, Saleve</HI> and other high moun∣tains
of <HI>Savoy, Daulphiny</HI> and the <HI>Alps,</HI> where they
are bare of wood, put forth very good grass so soon
as the snow is melted off them, which usually is
about or before mid-May. And then the Countrey
people drive up their cattel to pasture, and feed
them there for three months time. Upon these hill
tops they have heer and there low sheds or dairy
houses, which serve the men to live in and to make
their butter and cheese in, so long as they keep their
beasts above. The men I say, for they only ascend
up thither and do all the dairy work, leaving their
wives to keep house below; it being too toilsome
for them to clamber up such high and steep hills. By
reason of these cotes it is very convenient simpling
upon the mountains, for if a man be hungry or
thirsty he may soon find relief at one of them. We
always found the people very kind and willing to
give us such as they had, <HI>viz.</HI> brown bread, milk,
whey, butter, curds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which we could sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce
fasten any mony uon them.</P>
<P>For the temper of the air in respect of heat and
cold <HI>Geneva</HI> I think is very like <HI>England,</HI> there being
no great excess of either extreme. The City is well
governed, vice discountenanced, and the people ei∣ther
really better or at least more restrained then in
<PB N="436" REF="231"/>
other places: Though they do take liberty to shoot
and use other sports and exercises upon the Lords
day, yet most of their Ministers disallow it and
preach against it.</P>
<P>Our long stay heer at <HI>Geneva,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants observed about <HI>Geneva.</HI></NOTE> and that in the pro∣per
season for simpling, gave us leisure to search for
and advantage of finding many <HI>species</HI> of plants in
the neighbouring fields and mountains, of which I
shall heer present the Reader with a catalogue: Such
as are native of <HI>England</HI> are in the <HI>Roman</HI> letter.</P>

<HEAD>OF
MONTPELLIER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MOntpellier</HI> is a round Town, standing upon a
hill in the midst of a stony Countrey; some∣what
bigger than <HI>Geneva</HI> but not so populous. The
number of Inhabitants at present being about
25000, of which two third parts are Papists and
one Protestants. The Protestants have 2 Churches
(Temples they call them) in Town. The streets of
this City are very narrow, short and crooked, with∣out
any uniformity or beauty at all, so intricate that
its half a years work to understand them all, and
learn the way from place to place. The houses are
many of them well built of free stone, which were
they set well together in order would make 3 or 4
handsome streets. No large Piazza or market-place
in Town. The number of Apothecaries in this lit∣tle
City is scarce credible, there being 130 shops,
and yet all find something to do: Their <HI>Cypres pow∣der,
sweet bags, Cassolets, Treacle, Confectio. Alkermes
&amp; Hyacinthi</HI> having a name all <HI>France</HI> over. The
Queen of <HI>Hungaries</HI> water (as they call it) made
heer is likewise much bought up. It is nothing but
common Spirit of Wine in which Rosemary flowers
have been macerated, distilled from the said flowers.
The wines heerabout are very strong and bear wa∣ter
well. Their vineyards are of dwarf vines with∣out
any support, the standards when the branches
are prun'd off being like the standards of our Osier∣gardens.</P>
<P>At <HI>Montpellier</HI> the best Verdet or Verd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>greece (<HI>Vi∣ride
aeris</HI>) is made.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man∣ner of making Verde:</NOTE> They told us that so good could
not be made elsewhere though they used the same
<PB N="455" REF="240"/>
method and the same materials, whether it be to be
attributed to the just temper of heat, or the nature
of the wine they use, or some other unknown qua∣lity.
The manner thus,</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst they take Grape-stalks: well cleansed from
the raisins and from all filth, and putting in the bot∣tom
of a pot a quantity of the best red wine, they
set sticks cross a little above the wine, and upon them
lay a quantity of Grape-stalks first also drenched in
wine, and let them a lone about 15 days more or
less according to the season, till they come to make
(as they call it) a rose, that is the out-lides become
to appearance dry, and the middle only wet. These
grape stalks being thus prepared, they put in the
bottom of a large earthen pot of the best red wine
that begins to be sower, but is not yet come to be vi∣negar,
to the quantity of about two or three inches
depth, somewhat above the wine they set sticks
cross the pot, and having reatly many little plates of
Copper, they lay upon the dross sticks first a layer of
the prepared Grape-stalks, then a layer of copper
plates, and so alternately S S S till the pot be
full. In the middle of the pot they usually leave a
hole all along for the vapour of the wine to ascend;
neither are the copper plates laid near together for
the same reason. When they have filled up the pot
they cover it, and set it in a cellar, and after some 5
or 6 days turn the copper plates, letting the pot re∣main
in the cellar 3 or 4 days more. In 8 or 10
days according to the season the <HI>Verdet</HI> will be come.
Then they take out the plates and laying them 6 or 7
on a heap put them in a trough and sprinkle the
edges of them with the same wine for 3 or 4 days;
next they press them with heavy weights for 4 or 5
days, and last of all scrape off the <HI>Verdet</HI> with knives,
and moulding it with a little wine, dry it and sell it.
The same plates are again put into pots and used as
before. So then the Verdet is nothing but the rust or
<PB N="456" REF="241"/>
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urf of the copper calcined by the vapour of the wine.</P>
<P>Heer also we saw the manner and process of blan∣ching
of Bees wax.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man∣ner of blanch∣ing wax.</NOTE></P>
<P>First they melt the wax in a great copper Caul∣dron,
then they have ready a mould or form of wood
of the figure of a Sugar-loaf or the block of a stee∣ple-crown'd
hat, which having besmeared over with
slime of snails they dip into the wax thus melted.
This takes up a skin or film of wax as candles upon
dipping do. This they smooth with their hands and
dip in water, and when it is cold take it off the
form, from which by reason of the noin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the
form with the forementioned mucilage it will readi∣ly
slip in the form of a cone or long-crucible. These
cones (so let me call them) are set in a garden in
ranks singly one by one, supported with canes or
reeds crossing one another on this fashion,
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Round about they set pots with water, where∣with
they sprinkle the wax often to keep it from
melting. In Summer time, when the Sun lies hot
upon it some 6 or 7 times a day, otherwhiles but 3
or 4 times. In 14 or 15 days the upper end of there
cones will grow white, and then they turn them to
whiten the other end. In a months time more or
less according to the weather they will become white
all over. Then they melt the wax again in earthen
pans like <HI>Metae</HI> or scuttles, and run it so melted
through the neb of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m pot into water, and as it
runs down into the water a man either breaks it with
his hand into grains, or works it into round figures
like spiral wreaths or <HI>corollae,</HI> and these they expose
again to the weather in the garden and order as be∣fore,
<PB N="457" REF="241"/>
till they become purely white; and then melt
into great pieces to fell. The mucilage where with
they be smear the forms is made of snails taken alive
shells and all, and pounded in a mortar till they be∣come
a perfect pan or <HI>viscus.</HI> The form once besmea∣red

<P>At <HI>Montpillier</HI> is made the best <HI>Confectio Alkermes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Confectio Alkermes.</NOTE>
as reason there is it should, the grain which gives it
its denomination being in no Countrey of Europe
found so plentifully as heer. The manner of the pre∣paration
of this grain for the making the Confection
you may find setdown in the <HI>Philosoph. Transactions,
Numb.</HI> 20. <HI>page</HI> 362. and I shall therefore heer omit.
These grains have formerly been thought to have
been proper to the dwarf or shrub-<HI>Ilex,</HI> called there∣fore
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lex o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccifera,</HI> and a by-fruit or excrescency
of the twigs of that plant. But my learned and in∣genious
friend Mr. <HI>Martin Lister,</HI> who hath been
very happy in making discoveries in natural Histo∣ry,
hath found the like grains heer in <HI>England</HI> upon
the twigs of cherry and other trees, and judged them
to be the work of an insect, and by her affixed to
the twigs for nests to breed and harbour her young;
and indeed to me they appeared to be so, easily re∣ceding
and falling off from the wood when the
young are hatcht and gone. As for the grains them∣selves
they are so like the <HI>Kermes</HI> grains, that they
are scarce to be distinguished and grow to the twigs
just in the same places and manner. But for a more full
and compleat History of them I refer the Reader
<PB N="458" REF="242"/>
to Mr. <HI>Listers</HI> Letters published in the <HI>Philosophical
Transactions.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Montpellier</HI> I observed the manner of making
oil-olive:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man∣ner of making Oil olive.</NOTE> First they take olives, whether fresh ga∣thered
or laid a while on a heap it matters not (as
they told me) and bruise or grind them to a paste, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as
we do apples to make cider, with a perpendicular
mill-stone running round in a trough. This paste
or the olives thus bruised they put in round thin bas∣kets
made of <HI>Spartum</HI> like frails, having a round
hole in the top; but both top and bottom clapping
together, so that when pressed they look like a thin
round cake. Half a score or more of these baskets
filled with olive pouce they lay on a heap in the press
and letting down the press-beam, squeeze them at
first without any mixture. Then winding up the
beam they take out the baskets, and into each one
put a good quantity of scalding water, (which they
have always ready) and shaking the basket mingle it
with the pouce and then piling them one upon an∣other
as before, press them down a second time.
This second operation they repeat again, and then
taking out the pouce put in new and proceed as
before. The oil together with the water runs out in∣to
vessels set to receive it. The water with the <HI>Amur∣ca</HI>
sinks to the bottom, and the oil swims above it,
which they take off with a copper dish like a fleeting
dish, as good housewives ski<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the cream from their
milk. The water mixed with the red juyce of the
olives becomes red and thick, not at all mingling
with the oil, so that it cannot easily the least drop
of it be taken up without perceiving it. Its said that
in <HI>Provence</HI> they spread their olives on a floor after
they are gathered, and there let them rest 30 days to
dry, and for that reason their oil is better than that
of <HI>Languedoc.</HI> Others lay them on a heap a while to
let them sweat, as they call it. It is worth the no∣ting
that though the olives be very bitter and of a
<PB N="459" REF="242"/>
firy ungrateful taste, yet the on which is drawn from
them is sweet; the like is observed in bitter Al∣monds,
and it is very likely might be in all other
bitter fruits; which is a sufficient proof that the taste
of such fruits doth not inhere in the oil, at least
which is made by expression; and it deserves exa∣mination,
whether the chymical oil may not also be
devested of the taste of the vegetable from which it
is extracted.</P>
<P>Olives when they come to maturity change colour
and become black as some other plums do, but it is
very late in the year first. They are then notwith∣standing
of a horrid and ungrateful taste, firing the
throat and palate of one that eats them. They afford
most oil when fully ripe, but best (as they told us)
when gathered and pressed green. Sometimes they
pickle ripe olives, but they will not last; therefore
those which they pickle to send abroad are gathered
green. The pickle they use is nothing else but a brine
of salt and water.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Peroul</HI> about a league from <HI>Montpellier</HI> we
saw a boiling fountain (as they call it) that is the wa∣ter
did heave up and bubble as if it boiled.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The boil∣ing foun∣tain.</NOTE> This
phaenomenon in the water was caused by a vapour as∣cending
out of the earth through the water, as was
manifest, for that if one did but dig any where near
the place and pour water upon the place new dig∣ged,
one should observe in it the like bubbling, the
vapour arising not only in that place where the foun∣tain
was but all thereabout. The like vapor ascending
out of the earth and causing such ebullition in wa∣ter
it passes through hath been observed in Mr. <HI>Hawk∣ley</HI>'s
ground about a mile from the Town of <HI>Wigan</HI>
in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> which vapour by the application of
a lighted candle, paper or the like, catches fire and
flames vigorously. Whether or no this vapour at
<HI>Peroul</HI> would in like manner catch fire and burn I
cannot say, it coming not in our minds to make the
experiment.</P>
<P><PB N="460" REF="243"/>
From <HI>Montpellier</HI> we took a journey of pleasure to
see the adjacent Countrey, and first we rode to <HI>Fron∣tignan,</HI>
a little wall'd Town by the Estang side, 3
miles distant, which gives name to the so famous
muscate wine. The Countrey about this Town to∣ward
the Sea southward lies open to the Sun, but to∣ward
the land northward it is encompassed with a
ridge of hills in form of a bow, touching the Sea at
each end; so that the whole is like a Theatre: in
the <HI>Arena</HI> and on the sides of the hills grows the
muscate grape of which this wine is made. In this
space are contained two other little Towns, the one
called <HI>Miraval,</HI> the other <HI>Vich.</HI> This last gives name
to a mineral water, springing near it, much used
heerabout. It hath an acide Vitriolic taste, but no∣thing
so strong as our Spaw-waters, and therefore I
guess the operation of it is much weaker.</P>
<P>At <HI>Frontignan</HI> and other places we saw the man∣ner
of making raisins [uvae passae] They take the
fairest bunches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man∣ner of drying grapes to make raisins.</NOTE> and with a pair of scissers ship off
all the faulty grapes, and tie two bunches together
with a string. Then they dip them in a boiling lye
<HI>[lixivium]</HI> into which they put a little oil, till they
are very plump and ready to crack. <HI>Jo. Bauhinus</HI>
saith that they let them continue so long in the boil∣ing
<HI>lixivium, quoad flaccescant tantùm &amp; corrugentur.</HI>
But we observed no such thing, for they did not con∣tinue
the bunches half a minute, but presently took
them out again and washed them in a vessel of fair
cold water, then they put them upon wooden poles
for two or three days in the shade to dry, and after
that exposed them to the Sun, taking them in in the
night-time or rainy weather. <HI>Cyprianus Eichov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI>
describes the manner of making rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins in <HI>Spain</HI> thus.
There are (saith he) two sorts of <HI>Vvae passoe</HI> or rai∣sins;
the one of those they call Raisins of the Sun,
of a blew colour, the other of the <HI>Vvae passae Lixae,</HI>
which they call Frail or basket-Raisins. In preparing
<PB N="461" REF="243"/>
the first sort they thus proceed. When the bunch they
design for that purpose begins to grow tipe, they cut
the foot-stalk of it half asunder, that so the radical
juyce or moisture may be at least in a great measure
deteined and not pass to the grapes; and so they
leave it hanging on the vine. Then by the heat of
the Sun the grapes are by degrees dried. When they
are sufficiently dry they gather them and put them
up in vessels.</P>
<P>The second sort they make on this fashion. When
they prune their vines, they bind up the cut∣tings
in faggots and reserve them till the vintage
time. Then they burn them and of their ashes make
a lye or <HI>lixivi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> which they boil in great vessels,
and there in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>immerse the bunches of grapes one by
one. Afterwards to dry them they spread them up∣on
a paved floor clean swept, made for that pur∣pose
in the vineyard, that so they may be the more
speedily dried by the Sun-b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ams. When they are
sufficiently concocted and dried they put them up
in frails or baskets. After the same manner they pre∣pare
figs for to dry, by dipping them in a <HI>lixivium</HI>
made of the ashes of the dried branches of the fig∣tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
cut off in pruning. But however they superstiti∣ously
observe to make their <HI>lixivium</HI> for raisins of
the ashes of branches pruned off of the vine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I
doubt not but the ashes of any wood indifferently
taken would serve as well for that purpose.</P>
<P>From <HI>Frontignan</HI> we rode to <HI>Balleruch▪</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baths at Balleruch.</NOTE> to see the
hot waters which are used as well inwardly as out∣wardly.
At our being there, which was in the begin∣ning
of <HI>September,</HI> the water was scarce luke-warm;
they told us that in the Winter it was very hot. The
Bath is not above two flight-shots distant from the
Estang, and the water thereof tastes very salt and
brackish; whether by reason of the Seas being so
near it, or because the water comes from some salt
mine I know not, yet the latter seemeth the more
<PB N="462" REF="244"/>
probable, because should it come from the Sea, the
water straining through so much sand would proba∣bly
lose its salt by the way, as we have found by ex∣periment
in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Gabian</HI> about a days journey from <HI>Montpellier</HI>
in the way to <HI>Beziers</HI> is a fountain of <HI>Petroleum.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A foun∣tain of <HI>Petroleum</HI></NOTE> It
burns like oil, is of a strong pungent scent, and a
blackish colour. It distils out of several places of the
rock all the year long, but most in Summer time.
They gather it up with ladies and put it in a barrel
set on one end, which hath a spiggot just at the bot∣tom,
when they have put in a good quantity they
open the spiggot to let out the water, and when the
oil begins to come presently stop it. They pay for
the farm of this fountain about 50 crowns <HI>per. ann.</HI>
We were told by one Monsieur <HI>Beaushoste</HI> a Chymist
in <HI>Montpellier,</HI> that <HI>Petroleum</HI> was the very same with
the oil of Jet, and not to be distinguished from it
by colour, taste, smell, consistency, virtues, or any

<P>Upon the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in seve∣ral
places, as at <HI>Berre,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Making of salt by evapora∣ting Sea-water by the Sun∣beams.</NOTE> near <HI>Martegue</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> at

drawn into shallow pools and evaporated by the

into a large shallow plain like the cooler in a
Brew-house and there being well heated they run <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
into several shallow beds like the beds of a garden,
when the Sun hath dried up all the water they let
in more, and so again 3 or 4 times till the salt re∣maining
at the bottom of these receptacles come to
be 3 fingers thick, and then they take it up with sho∣vels,
and heap it on little hills: but the whole pro∣cess
of this operation being exactly described in the

they shed the milt [<HI>Lac piscium.</HI>] The females
<HI>Botar,</HI> of the rows or spawn of which <HI>Botargo</HI> is
made. They first take out the spawn entire, and cover
it round with salt for 4 or 5 hours: then they press it a

it, and at last dry it in the Sun for 13 or 14 days ta∣king
it in at nights.</P>

souls was about 120000. The streets are narrow as
<PB N="464" REF="245"/>
in most of the ancient Towns in this Countrey to
keep off the scorching beams of the Sun in Summer
time. The haven is the most secure and commodious
that I have seen: the entrance into it so strait and
narrow that a man may easily cast a stone cross it,
but the haven within large enough to contain 500
vessels or more: of an oval figure. On one side of
this haven the Town is built which compasses it
more than half round, having before it a handsome
kay well paved, which serves the Citizens for a walk
or Promenade. This haven is not capable of ships of
above 600 tun. On the rocks near this Town I

make holes in their stone-walls at three or four foot

the fruit whereof they prepare and pickle after this
fashion. They gather the buds or blossoms of the
flowers before they be explicated, and spreading
them thin, lay them in the shade to wither for three
or four hours, to prevent the opening of the flower.
Then they put them in a vessel, and pour vinegar
upon them, covering the vessel with a board, and
so let them stand for nine days; at the end whereof
they take them out and press them gently, and put
them in fresh vinegar, letting them stand as long as
before: this done the third time, they put them up
in barrels with vinegar. Some mingle salt with their
vinegar, which is the best way, and preserves the Ci∣pers

any water.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 1. We intended to have seen the Coral-fishing
heer, but the windy weather hindred us. The
Sea must be very calm and smooth, else it is impos∣sible
for them to fish for it. It grows downward (as
the urinators told us) under the hollow rocks, and
not upwards as trees. I believe rather that it grows
indifferently either upwards or downwards accord∣ing
to the situation of the rocks.</P>
<P><PB N="467" REF="246"/>
The engine they use to get it is a great cross of
wood ABCD, that at the middle E hath a huge
weight of lead made fast to it and at each end
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
A, B, C, D, a round net. To the lead at E is fast∣ned
a long rope. They go out in little boats and let
down this cross; and when they have found a rock
at the bottom of the Sea, he that manages the rope
thrusts it into the hollows, getting in one or two of
the legs, and if there be any coral it entangles in
the nets at the end of the cross, by which it is torn
off and brought up. The natural colour of the coral
while it is alive and growing to the rocks is a pale
carneous; but when the scurf (which answers to
the bark in trees) is rubbed off, it is red. The Coral
that dies or is broken off from the rocks loses that
carneous scurf or bark in the Sea and becomes red,
though sometimes it gets a greenish white rust. They
<PB N="468" REF="247"/>
say it is 50 years before it comes to its full growth:
but that I conceive is an ungrounded conjecture.
They sometimes but very rarely find branches of
three or four pounds weight. It rots, dies, grows
light, worm-eaten and full of holes like wood. They
all affirmed it to be hard and not soft as it grows un∣der
water, contrary to the current tradition of the
Ancients, <HI>Moliis fuit herba sub undis.</HI> I believe the
outward scurf or bark may be soft, it easily crum∣bling
off afterwards, which might give occasion to
the fable. They told us that a piece of Coral (having
the carneous scurf upon it) wetted is just the same as
when it is first taken out of the Sea. The best Coral
rude as it is found is worth a Pistol the pound, or
two or three pieces of eight: Polished and wrought
into beads, bracelets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at <HI>Marseilles</HI> it is sold

and pointed like crystal. There are of three
sorts, the best are the blackest or deepest violet.
2. Others are almost quite white. 3. Some, but very
rarely, are found tinctured with yellow, They some∣times
stick a great many together to the rock like the
<HI>Bristow</HI>-diamonds; but those are never good: the
best are found loose in the chinks of the rock in a fat
yellowish or reddish earth. They scrape out this
earth with long narrow knives that enter into the
chinks, and then crumble it in pieces with their fin∣gers
to feel for the stones. They are afterwards ground
and polished upon leaden moulds after the same
manner as crystal is. First they use the dust of <HI>Smiril</HI>
or Emery, and at last of <HI>Tripoli.</HI> All along the way
to this hill we saw abundance of <HI>Arbutus</HI> and <HI>Rbus
coriariorum</HI> called <HI>Rhondo.</HI> In this Countrey they use
not bark of Oak to tan their leather, as we do, but
<PB N="470" REF="248"/>
the leaves and branches of this shrub, which they first
bruise with a perpendicular stone, and then mingle
with water, and heating the water luke-warm, steep
the skins in it 3 or 4 days. In these mountains are
also found Emeralds, Gold and other sorts of mine∣rals
and stones, but it doth not turn to account to
search for them. Topazes are found in a lake called
the lake of <HI>Silles,</HI> not far from <HI>S. Colonna</HI> near <HI>Girona.</HI>
They find them upon the shore of the lake.</P>
<P>At <HI>Vict</HI> there is a great Market-place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 5.</NOTE> and a
Church at a <HI>Covent,</HI> said to have been built by <HI>Char∣lemagne</HI>
when he had discomfited the Saracens &amp;
driven them out of <HI>Catalonia.</HI> This night we lodged
at <HI>Moia</HI> having travelled only 3 leagues.</P>
<P>We rode within sight of <HI>Montserret,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> broken at the
top into rocks standing like the teeth of a Saw, from
whence it took its name. There is a Chappel of our
Lady, a place of great devotion. This night we
lodged at <HI>Casa della pobla,</HI> a single Inn, 5 leagues.</P>
<P>We came to <HI>Cardona</HI> 2 leagues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> All the way as we
rode the rocks and stones were full of round holes,
just like those in the stones at <HI>Ancona</HI> in which the
<HI>Pholades</HI> harbour; and there is no question but these
holes have been made by some animal before the
stones were hardned.</P>
<P>We viewed the mountain of salt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE> where were
three Officers, one to weigh the salt, another to re∣ceive
money, and the third to keep accounts.
The Revenue of this Salt amounts yearly to about
30000 pieces of eight. For every Quintal, that is
104 pounds, they pay ten <HI>reals</HI> of two <HI>sous</HI> to a <HI>real.</HI>
The salt is hard and transparent like crystal, and
when powdred fine as white as snow. They hew
it out with axes and mattocks; and make chaplets,
boxes, &amp;c. of it. They say there is no end of it, but
that it reaches to the center of the earth. Near the
place where they work there are two caves within the
rock of salt, to the end of one of which they never
durst venture to go.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="248"/>
Not far from this there is another mountain of
salt, where the salt sticks to the rocks, and is most of
it tinctured with red. Of this red salt they make
broad plates like tiles, which they call <HI>Ruggiolas;</HI>
these they heat before the fire, but never put them
into it, and use them to take away aches, strengthen
the stomach, keep the feet warm, &amp;c. Well heated
on both sides they will keep warm for 24 hours.
Amongst this red salt there is a kind of <HI>Selenitis,</HI>
(which some call Ising-glass, and the <HI>Italians Gesso,</HI>
from the Latin wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Gypsum,</HI> signifying chalk, be∣cause
when burnt it is turned into a white <HI>calx</HI>)
which naturally roches into Parallelipipedums of
the figure of a Lozenge. Of which sorts of stones
are found in several places of our nation. About
these mountains of salt grows great plenty of <HI>Hali∣mus</HI>
and <HI>Limonium.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cardona</HI> is a Dukedom containing 3 or 4 villa∣ges
besides the town. The Duke thereof is one of
the richest Grandees of <HI>Spain,</HI> having 3 Dukedoms,
4 Marquisates, 2 Earldoms &amp;c. The name of his
family is <HI>Folke.</HI> He lives for the most part at <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI>
but sends every three years a Governour. The
King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath nothing at all to do with this
city: and the Duke never imposes any taxes, but
hath only all the tithes of the corn, wine, &amp;c. There
is a Council of 36 changed every year, and he that
hath been of the Council must wait three years be∣fore
he can be chosen again. The last thing the
Council does is to chuse a new Council for the year
following. This new Council is divided into four
Ranks, not equally, but as the old Council shall
think fit; and their names are put into 4 boxes, out
of every box a child takes out one to be Consul. He
that is drawn out of the first box is the first Consul,
and so in order. Near the town is a castle, and in
the castle a tower said to be built by <HI>Charlemagne.</HI>
Every Duke hath an oath given him by the Consuls,
<PB N="472" REF="249"/>
wherein is an Article that he must reside in the ca∣stle,
which is never kept.</P>
<P>We passed through <HI>Kalah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 9.</NOTE> and lay at a single Inn
a league and an half further, four leagues and an half

<P>We passed through <HI>S. Columba,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE> <HI>Roccafort,</HI> and
lay at <HI>Sirreall</HI> five leagues and an half.</P>
<P>We passed by <HI>Pobla</HI> a famous ancient Monastery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE>
about two leagues distant from <HI>Sirreall.</HI> In the
Church there are a great many monuments. They
told us that 13 Queens and 7 Kings lay interred
there. Then we passed <HI>Praves,</HI> and lay that night at
<HI>Coulnouvil</HI> 5 leagues. All over <HI>Catalonia</HI> they reckon
a league two hours, and make account that 4 <HI>Cata∣lonian</HI>
leagues are equal to 6 <HI>French.</HI> We heard that
there were Amethysts also found about <HI>Praves.</HI></P>
<P>We passed by <HI>Falsot</HI> two leagues from <HI>Coulnou∣ville,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE>
where are a great many Lead-mines. The oar
is very rich, and they melt it just as it is taken out
of the mine, without beating it to powder. They
fell the oar for 40 <HI>Reals</HI> of <HI>Ardit</HI> the Quintal, a
Quintal being 122 pounds: Five Quintals of oar
usually yield four Quintals of lead. This town and
the mines about it belong to the Duke of <HI>Cardona.</HI>
They told us that the vein of metal lay always East
and West. The best and finest of this oar they grind
to powder, and thereof make varnish to lead ear∣then
pots and vessels with, sprinkling the powder
upon the pots. This night we lay at <HI>Tivisa,</HI> four
leagues.</P>
<P>We passed <HI>Venu-falet, Tivians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">13</NOTE> and lodged at <HI>Tor∣tosa,</HI>
6 leagues. All along the way we saw a great
deal of <HI>Palma humilis. Hispanica non spinosa.</HI> The
fruit grew up in bunches out of the ground like the
berries of <HI>Arum,</HI> and was not much bigger. Those
that were ripe were of a reddish colour, of an oblong
figure, and divided into 4 quarters: those that
were less ripe were yellowish. The skin and pulp
<PB N="473" REF="249"/>
very thin, and did but just serve to cover the stone.
It hath the smell and taste of Dates. The stones be∣ing
broken are not at all hollow, but have a hard
white kernel or pearl within them. We observed al∣so
abundance of <HI>Garossus</HI> (as they call it) i. e. <HI>Caro∣ba</HI>
sive <HI>Siliqua dulcis,</HI> the cods whereof they give
their mules instead of provender. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Sol∣diers
at the siege of <HI>Barcellona</HI> had nothing but these
<HI>Siliquae</HI> and water to live upon. All over <HI>Catalonia</HI>
the people are generally poor. They use neither
glass nor paper in their windows, but only shuts
of wood.</P>
<P><HI>Tortosa</HI> is a very poor and desolate town. There is
a bridge of boats over the river <HI>Iberus,</HI> now called
<HI>Ebro,</HI> in sight of which we rode all along from <HI>Ti∣visa</HI>
hither. At <HI>Tortosa</HI> they were wont to make salt-sellars,
mortars, bouls, beads, &amp;c. of a kind of mar∣ble
of a mingled colour, red and yellow, sound near
the town, which they call <HI>Jasper,</HI> and of another
greenish marble spotted with black, brought from
<HI>Genoa.</HI></P>
<P>We went to the Jasper mine about 2 miles from
the town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE> with one of the chief workmen. We saw
there vast pillars hewn out and wrought for a
Church in <HI>Palermo.</HI> He told us that all the veins of
marble, jasper, &amp;c. went from East to West. That
they sawed these stones to make tables, &amp;c. with
only water and sand. That when there was not e∣nough
red in the stone they made little holes and
set in red stones. That the cement they used for all
stones in Mosaic works was made of one half ma∣stich,
and one half <HI>Greek</HI> pitch. That in building
they joyned the stones together with ordinary lime,
but on the outside they filled up the chinks with a
cement made of the powder of the Jasper mingled
with sulphur and <HI>Mangra;</HI> to make it more white
they put in more sulphur, to make it more red
they put in more <HI>Mangra.</HI> The Jasper was hew'd
<PB N="474" REF="250"/>
out with chizzels and hammers, just as stone in our
stone-pits. It is afterwards polished with Armoril,
<HI>i. e.</HI> the powder they use to polish armour with
and to give it a lustre, so that one may see his face in
it with the powder of the cinders of the best Tin.</P>
<P>This day we set out towards <HI>Valence</HI> passing the
<HI>Ebro</HI> by the bridge of boats, and lodged at <HI>Galera</HI>
a small village 2 leagues distant from <HI>Tortosa.</HI></P>
<P>We passed by <HI>Tregera,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 16.</NOTE> whereabouts seemed to be
the ruines of an old <HI>Romane</HI> way; <HI>Mattheau, Sal∣sandail,</HI>
and lay at <HI>Lescouvas,</HI> 7 leagues. Near <HI>Les∣couvas</HI>
we found store of <HI>Oleander</HI> with a red flower.</P>
<P>We passed <HI>Cabanos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE> <HI>Pobletta, Buriol, villa real,
Annules,</HI> 7 leagues. This journey we saw a great
many rivers quite dried up, and for above a month
together had scarce any rain. That little that was
always came just from the sea.</P>
<P>We passed <HI>Chinoes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE> <HI>Almenaro, Moulvedere (an Sa∣guntus?)
Massa-magril, Albalade,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Va∣lence,</HI>
7 leagues. Near <HI>Valence</HI> the Countrey is ve∣ry
populous and well cultivated. Abundance of Mul∣berry-trees
are planted in rows all the fields over.
As we passed through the Market-place at <HI>Valence</HI>
all the people houted at us, and threw parings of
melons, &amp;c. on our cloaks. It seems they are not
used to see strangers and travellers there. This was
the first place; in <HI>Spain</HI> where we were searched.
In this city is an University. I heard a Professor
read Logic. The scholars are sufficiently insolent
and very disputacious: One of them asked me,
<HI>Quid est Ens universale?</HI> and whether I was of <HI>Tho∣mas
Aquinas</HI> his opinion: another, <HI>Quid est Genus?</HI>
None of them understood any thing of the new
Philosophy, or had so much as heard of it. None
of the new books to be found in any of their Book∣sellers
shops: In a word the University of <HI>Valence</HI> is
just where our Universities were 100 years ago.</P>
<P><PB N="475" REF="250"/>
In the Kingdom of <HI>Valence</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is
not absolute; but to impose taxes, raise soldiers,
&amp;c. he must have the consent of the three Estates,
<HI>i. e.</HI> 1. The Clergy. 2. The Nobility. 3. The Ci∣ties
and Villages: and if one of these refuse to con∣sent
nothing can be done. These three Estates
have 6 Deputies, 2 for each, who are changed e∣very
third year. Of the two for the Cities one is
for the City of <HI>Valentia,</HI> and the other for all the
rest. Each City chusing a Syndic, one is taken by
lot to be a Deputy. The six Deputies have the care
and government of the <HI>Militia.</HI> Upon any urgent
occasion the Deputies must assemble the 3 Estates,
<HI>i. e.</HI> the chief of the Clergy, the Nobility, and the
Syndics of the Cities.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Valence</HI> is governed by six Jurats or
Consuls. They are taken by lot out of 6 Urns or
Burses, two out of each: In the first Urn are the
names of all the better sort of Nobility that have
the title of <HI>Dons:</HI> in the second Urn the names of
all the lower rank of Nobility, that have not the
title of <HI>Don:</HI> in the third the names of all rich
Citizens that are not Gentlemen; they must have
al least 400 crowns yearly rent besides what their
wives bring. Besides these there is a Rationel and
two Syndics changed every third year; six Advo∣cates
for their lives, and 40 Plebeians changed
yearly. The City being divided into 15 Trades or
Companies; each Company chuses two, which make
30; the other ten are chosen, two by the Ratio∣nel,
and eight by the six Jurats and two Syndics,
each chusing one. Of all these Officers and the 40
Plebeians consists the Senate. But nothing can be
done unless there be 29 of the Plebeians present at
least. There is also 1. a Judge for criminal causes,
taken by turns out of the 3 Urns, and changed
yearly. He hath an Advocate to assist him, who is
changed yearly, but so that all the Advocates in
<PB N="476" REF="251"/>
the City have the place by turns: and a <HI>Lieutenant
criminel,</HI> taken by lot out of the 40 Plebeians. 2. A
<HI>Mustafa</HI> who has the care of all kind of victuals,
corn, weights, measures, &amp;c. He is taken by lot out
of the 3 burses as the criminal Judge is, and hath
also a Lieutenant out of the 40. Moreover there is
a Judge for civil causes taken out of the 3 Burses,
who has an Advocate like the criminal Judge;
but he cannot decide causes of above fifteen
crowns.</P>
<P>The University is governed by the Town, who
every third year chuse a <HI>Rector</HI> that must be a Ca∣non.
The other Officers are a Bedel, a Sergeant
and a Puntadore, who is to take notice when any
Professour fails to read. There are eight <HI>Praepositi</HI> in
this University, four for Divinity, two for the Ca∣non
Law, and two for the Civil Law; who have
each 500 crowns yearly. There are also four Rea∣ders
for Philosophy, seven for Physic, one for the
Greek tongue, one for the Hebrew, and two for the
Mathematics. These have but small stipends, but
all their scholars that come to hear their lectures pay
somewhat yearly. If a Professor promote 3 rich
scholars, that are able to pay the fees, to any de∣gree,
he may promote a fourth that is poor for no∣thing.
The degrees are the same with those in our
Universities, viz. 1. Batchelour after they have finish∣ed
a course in Philosophy; which degree costs a∣bout
12 crowns. 2. Master of Arts, which costs 80.
3. Batchelour in Divinity, Law or Physic, which
costs 16. 4. Doctor, which costs 150. They may be
Masters of Arts presently after they are Batchelours
if they will, and in like manner Doctors. In the
Market at <HI>Valence</HI> and all <HI>Spain</HI> over they divide
hens and chickens into pieces and sell them by quar∣ters:
They make great vessels of Goats skins to put
wine and oil in, and lesser bottles which they call
<HI>boto's.</HI> The women paint, laying it on so thick as
<PB N="477" REF="251"/>
if one daubed <HI>minium</HI> upon a wall. No Garrison nor

<P>We set out from <HI>Valence,</HI> and passing by <HI>Masa∣nasse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 24.</NOTE>
<HI>Catareggi</HI> &amp; <HI>Seille</HI> lodged at <HI>Mussafes,</HI> 3 leagues.
Coming out of <HI>Valence</HI> we were fain to give money
at 3 places to avoid searching.</P>
<P>We passed <HI>Cullera,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE> where we ferried over a great
river called <HI>Xucar,</HI> and lay at <HI>Gandia.</HI> There is a
College and an University, as appears by this in∣scription
upon the wall of the Col. <HI>Sanctus Franci∣scus
à Borgia, Dux Gandiae</HI> 4, <HI>Praepositus generalis So∣cietatis
Jesu</HI> 3 <HI>hoc Collegium &amp; hanc Vniversitatem à
fundamentis erexit</HI> A. D. 1546. At <HI>Cullera</HI> the wine
first began to be sweet, and 3 leagues off at <HI>Gandia</HI>
the Plantations of Sugar-canes began. <HI>Q.</HI> Whether
the nature of the soil that was fit to nourish the
Sugar-canes did not also contribute to the sweet∣ness
of the Grapes? At <HI>Gandia</HI> we first found raisins
of the sun (as they are called in <HI>England</HI>) in <HI>Spain</HI>
they call this kind <HI>Pansas,</HI> and they seem to be the
<HI>Duracinae</HI> of the Ancients. They are all white, round,
and have a tougher skin than other Grapes. They
gather them when fully ripe, and dip them in a
boiling <HI>Lixivium</HI> of water and ashes, just dipping
them in, and taking them out again; and then dry
them upon boards in the sun, taking them in by
night or in foul weather. The name Raisin comes
from <HI>Racemus.</HI> Figs are dried just as they are ga∣thered,
not being dipt into any <HI>lixivium.</HI></P>
<P>I went to <HI>Olives,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE> where and at <HI>Gandia</HI> are the
Engines for Sugar-works, the best are at <HI>Olives.</HI> By
the way we saw the Sugar-canes growing in several
places. They are planted in low wet grounds,
well mucked and dressed, divided into beds or hil∣locks
are furrows. They cut the canes close to the
roots in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> and cutting of the
slender tops, which afford no good juice, keep them
under ground till <HI>March,</HI> and then prick them into
<PB N="478" REF="252"/>
these hillocks or beds; out of every <HI>talea</HI> or cut shoot
4, 5, or 6 canes, which will be ripe the next Decem∣ber.
The knots or joynts of the cane at the bot∣tom
are very close together, scarce an inch asunder,
but upwards the distance is more as the cane grows
slenderer. Within is a white pulp or pith, full of
sap, sweet as honey. They sell them at <HI>Gandia</HI> to
eat, and cutting them into pieces just in the middle
between two knots, suck the pieces at both ends.
To make sugar, after the canes are cleansed from the
tops and leaves, and cut into pieces, they are first
bruised either with a perpendicular stone running
round, as apples to make cider, or olives to make
oil; or between two axes strongly capped with iron
horizontally placed and turned contrary ways; and
then pressed as grapes or olives are. The juice thus
pressed out is boiled in three several Cauldrons, one
after another. In the third Cauldron it becomes
thick and black, and is then put into conical pots
which at the bottom have a little hole stopped only
with course and foul sugar; Mr. <HI>Ligon</HI> saith with
Plantain leaves. These pots are covered when full
with a cake of past, made of a kind of earth called
in Spanish <HI>Gritto,</HI> and found near <HI>Olives,</HI> which is
good to take spots out of clothes, which cap or
cover sinks as the sugar sinks. [Mr. <HI>Swift</HI> told me
that the clay they use with us is tobacco-pipe clay,
or very like it, and that the water in the clay served
to wash down and carry away the <HI>Molossos,</HI> at least
the clay helps the separation and precipitation of it]
These conical pots are put into other pots, into
which by the hole at the <HI>vertex</HI> the juice dreins
down through the course sugar at the bottom. It
dreins so for 5 or 6 moneths, in which time the su∣gar
in the conical pots grows hard and white, all
the juice being either drunk up by the lute, or run
out by the hole at the <HI>vertex.</HI> This juice is boiled a∣gain
so long as it is good for any thing, but at last
<PB N="479" REF="252"/>
it makes only a foul red sugar that will never be bet∣ter.
The conical loaves of sugar after they are taken
out are set to drein over the same pots for 14 or 15
days. To make the sugar more white they must boil
it again, but about one sixth is lost every time. A
pound, of sugar of 12 ounces is sold at <HI>Olives</HI> for
three <HI>sous</HI> and a half; refined for 5 or 6 <HI>sous.</HI> The
sugar-juice is strained through strainers of linnen, as
it is put out of one Cauldron into another. They take
it out of the first and second Cauldrons so soon as it
begins to boil: but in the third Cauldron they let it
boil till the scum rises, and then take off only the
scum with a scummer, and put it into a long trough
to cool, and when it is cool put it into the conical
pots. One scum rises after another in the third
Cauldron. The scum when it is taken off is white,
but turns to a black liquor in the trough. They
never refine the sugar more than 3 or four times.
They use for the refining of it whites of eggs putting
in 2 or 3 dozen into a Cauldron. They use but one
Cauldron for refining. When it is refined it grows
white and hard in 9 or 10 days. The juice boiled up
is eaten with bread tosted as honey: The juice of the
refined sugar is much better than the first juice. The
Duke of <HI>Gandia</HI> sends presents of this refined juice
to the Queen of <HI>Spain.</HI> When they refine it they
put in a little water into the cauldrons to dissolve it
the better. But for a more exact description of the
whole process of the Sugar-works, I refer to <HI>Piso</HI>
in his natural history of <HI>Brasil,</HI> and <HI>Ligon</HI> in his De∣scription
of the <HI>Barbados.</HI> The Sugar of <HI>Olives</HI> is
better than the Sugar of <HI>Gandia.</HI> At <HI>Meuttria</HI> in <HI>Gra∣nada</HI>
they also make a great deal of Sugar.</P>
<P>About <HI>Valence, Gandia,</HI> &amp;c. the earth is alwayes
wrought, and never lies fallow or idle. They rec∣kon
5 <HI>Raccolta</HI>'s or crops in one year. 1. Of Mul∣berry
leaves for silk. 2. Wheat and other European
grain. 3. <HI>Darsi, i. e. Maiz</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Wheat. 4. Grapes.
<PB N="480" REF="253"/>
5. Olives; and 6. at <HI>Gandia</HI> Sugar-canes. After the
wheat is cut they presently sow the <HI>Indian</HI> Wheat.
They complained that lately for a great many years
together they had very vad <HI>Raccolta's</HI> for want of
rain, which had almost ruin'd <HI>Spain.</HI></P>

About a league from the Town began a very remar∣kable
Aquaeduct made by the <HI>Moors.</HI> It was just over
a river along the side of a hill, in most places not
above a yard or two under ground, and had a great
many funnels just like the tops of chimneys to give
vent, and let out the water when there should be
too much. The tops of these funnels were made of
a red clay and pebble stones. The water came al∣most
to the top in all of them, but run over but in

wood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After that Pilgrims, Travellers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have
bought them, they carry them to the Castle to touch
them by a famous Cross, which according to their

which forsooth infuses a wonderful virtue in∣to
them. We lay this night at an odd house four
leagues off <HI>Caravacca,</HI> having travelled in all ten
leagues.</P>
<P>We passed by <HI>Venta nova,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> and came to <HI>Huesca,</HI> 8
leagues. At <HI>Huesca</HI> we first saw a yellowish white
wine like sack. The Kingdom of <HI>Granada</HI> began
about 4 leagues before we came to <HI>Huesca.</HI> The town
of <HI>Huesca</HI> belongs to the Duke of <HI>Alva.</HI></P>
<P>We passed by <HI>Basa</HI> and rested at <HI>Venta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> 8 leagues.</P>
<P>We travelled to <HI>Guadix,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE> an Episcopal Sea, and
ancient <HI>Roman</HI> Colony. Upon the gates we took
notice of this inscription. <HI>Recepit Colonia Accitana

<P>We travelled to <HI>Granada</HI> 6 leagues distant from
<HI>Desinos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> where we lodged the night before. Heer
we saw the Castle called <HI>La Lhambra,</HI> the seat of
the Kings of <HI>Granada.</HI> Within the walls of the Ca∣stle
live abundance of people which dare not live in
the City for debt or other causes. There is a fair
Palace begun by <HI>Charles</HI> V and yet unfinished: the
outside of it is square, but it is round within, ha∣ving
two rows of Cloysters one above another round
about the Court. Adjoyning to this is the antient Pa∣lace
of the Kings of <HI>Granada:</HI> within there is all the
same kind of Moresco-work wrought in mortar
and stone with gold and painting. The Cloysters are
supported by long slender pillars. In this Palace is
an octagonal Chamber vaulted at the top, with 8
doors, one in every side. If one stand in one angle
and whisper to another that stands in the angle dia∣metrically
opposite, the voice is conveyed as in the
the whispering place at <HI>Glocester:</HI> but if you stand
in an angle that is not diametrically opposite you
hear nothing. The reason of the conveying the voice
is the vault above, and the corners being streightned
into a very sharp angle or channel. In <HI>Granada</HI> are
two great Market-places, one called <HI>Plassa nova,</HI> the
other <HI>de villa Rambla.</HI> In the great Church are two
Monuments, one for <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabella,</HI> with this
inscription, <HI>Mahometicae sectae prostratores, Haereticae per∣vicaciae
extinctores, Fernandus Aragonum &amp; Helisabetha
Castellae, vir &amp; axor unanimes, Catholici appellati mar∣moreo
clauduntur hoc tumulo.</HI> The other is of <HI>Philippus</HI>
I, and <HI>Joanna,</HI> daughter and heir of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and
<HI>Isabella</HI> without an inscription. In the river <HI>Daro</HI>
that runs by <HI>Granada</HI> they find gold among the
sand. In the mountains of <HI>Sierra neveda</HI> near <HI>Gra∣nada</HI>
are said to be divers sorts of minerals, which
are not at all looked after. Near <HI>Motril</HI> at the <HI>Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
di Gatto</HI> there is a Mine of Granates covered with
<PB N="683" REF="254"/>
the sea. They are pointed as Amethysts and Cry∣stal,
but the best come from <HI>Africa.</HI> We saw that
day <HI>Montesacro,</HI> a place within half a league of the
Town, of great devotion. In <HI>Castile, Granada, &amp;c.</HI>
the greater Cities have a <HI>Corregidore,</HI> and the lesser
an <HI>Alcayde,</HI> who administer justice, and are appoint∣ed
and sent by the King to govern the Towns. All
over the Kingdom of <HI>Castile</HI> they eat flesh upon Sa∣turdays,
and observe only Fridays.</P>
<P>We left <HI>Granada,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE> and passing by <HI>Santa Fede,</HI> tra∣velled
to <HI>Lotta,</HI> 8 leagues.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lotta</HI> we were troubled with soldiers that
came from the frontiers of <HI>Portugal</HI> to take up their
winter Quarters.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13.</NOTE> There had been of this party 2600,
but this summer at <HI>Alcantara</HI> they were reduced to
900, the rest being slain, or dead of diseases. We
passed this day by <HI>Archidona, Lalameda, Larouda,</HI>
and lay at <HI>Pedrera,</HI> 10 leagues.</P>
<P>We passed by <HI>Ossuna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE> <HI>La Pobla,</HI> and lay at <HI>Ela∣zabal,</HI>
10 leagues. This Countrey was the best we
saw since we came into <HI>Spain,</HI> the land being for the
most part well planted and cultivated.</P>
<P>We passed by <HI>Gandula,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE> and arrived at <HI>Sevil,</HI> 7
leagues. Between <HI>Gandula</HI> and <HI>Sevil</HI> there are abun∣dance
of Olive-trees. Heer we first saw the greater
sort of Olives, which are usually eaten in <HI>England</HI>
for a sallet, called the great <HI>Spanish</HI> Olive; all that
we had seen in <HI>Italy</HI> or in <HI>Spain</HI> before being of the
lesser sort. Here is a brave Aqueduct of brick,
which conveys water from <HI>Carmona,</HI> six leagues di∣stant:
under the Arches there are <HI>Stalactites,</HI> as at
the Aqueduct of <HI>Pisa.</HI> The Gallions bring nothing
home from the <HI>West-Indies</HI> but Plate, the Merchants
ships are loaden with leather, <HI>Cacao,</HI> Sugar, <HI>Lana
di Vigonna,</HI> &amp;c. Of the <HI>Cacao</HI> Nut they make <HI>Choco∣late</HI>
thus; First they tost the berries to get off the
husk, then pound the kernels to powder, and to e∣very
<HI>Miliao, i. e.</HI> 3 pound and a half of powder they
<PB N="484" REF="255"/>
add and mingle two pound of Sugar, 12 <HI>Vanillas,</HI> a
little <HI>Pimentone</HI> or Guiny Pepper, (which is used by
the Spaniards only) and a little <HI>Acchiote</HI> to give a
colour; but these two last may be omitted. They
melt the Sugar, and then mingle all well together,
and work it up either in rolls or loaves.</P>
<P>Sevil <HI>hath of late decayed very much, and doth
continually decay more and more, the trading being
most removed to</HI> Cales; <HI>the reason whereof is be∣cause
they pay about</HI> 27 per cent. <HI>for all merchandi∣ses
at</HI> Sevil, <HI>and but</HI> 4 <HI>or</HI> 5 per cent. <HI>at</HI> Cales. <HI>The
chief places to be seen in</HI> Sevil <HI>are</HI> 1. <HI>The great
Church.</HI> 2. <HI>The Kings or Assistants Palace.</HI> 3. <HI>The
Archbishops Palace.</HI> 4. <HI>The Steeple of the great
Church, like Saint</HI> Marks <HI>Tower at</HI> Venice, <HI>which
you ascend almost to the top without stairs, by
gently inclining plains.</HI> 5. <HI>The</HI> Franciscan Covent.
6. <HI>The</HI> Longha, <HI>where the Merchants meet about the
affairs of the flote.</HI> 7. <HI>The</HI> Convent <HI>of</HI> Nostredame

i. e. <HI>the river</HI> Baetis. <HI>The Town on the o∣ther
side this river is called</HI> Triana. 9. <HI>The Inqui∣sition
or Castle of</HI> Triana <HI>just over the Bridge.</HI>
10. <HI>An old Tower, called</HI> Torre d'oro, <HI>where St.</HI>
Ferdinand <HI>that recovered</HI> Sevil <HI>kept money made of
leather.</HI> 11. <HI>The Aqueduct.</HI> 12. <HI>The old Palace
and Garden of the Moors. Near the Bridge along
the river side they come every night with their
Coaches to take the</HI> fresco. <HI>In the great Church be∣tween
two Altars are three Monuments for St.</HI> Fer∣dinand
<HI>the wise, his wife</HI> Beatrice <HI>and his son</HI> Alphon∣sus.

<P>The most considerable places in <HI>Cordova</HI> are 1.
The Bishops Palace. 2. The <HI>Cavallerisca,</HI> where the
King keeps a great many horses. 3. The ruines of
<HI>Almansor</HI>'s Palace, the last King of the Moors. 4.
Plassa di Corridera: 5. The Church of the Au∣gustine
Freres. 6. The great Church, which was
anciently a Mosque. It is large but very low, sup∣ported
by a great many rows of pillars in a quadrate
order, 16 rows one way and 30 another. Upon ma∣ny
of the pillars are Moors heads carved in the stone,
and one or two with turbants on. In the middle of
this Church is the great Chappel where are several
Bishops interred. In one of the Chappels that is now
dedicated to S. <HI>Peter</HI> in the Moors time was kept a
thigh of <HI>Mahomet:</HI> Round about the cornish of this
Chappel and that part of the Church next it is an
<HI>Arabic</HI> inscription. The People complain grievously
that <HI>Cordova</HI> is quite ruined and undone by Gabels
and taxes.</P>
<P>We left <HI>Cordova</HI> and after a league or two riding
entred the <HI>Sierra Morena,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE> a miserable desolate moun∣tainous
Countrey, and lodged at a little village cal∣led
<HI>Adamus;</HI> 6 leagues.</P>
<P>We travelled all day through the <HI>Sierra Morena,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">28.</NOTE>
and lay at a village called <HI>La conquista;</HI> 9 leagues.</P>
<P>In this days journey we saw abundance of galls up∣on
the <HI>Ilices,</HI> which were of like bigness, figure, co∣lour,
consistency and other accidents with those that
grow upon Oaks. This day we first met with red
wine again which they call <HI>Vino tinto.</HI> We got safe
out of <HI>Sierra Morena,</HI> and came to <HI>Almedovar del
campo,</HI> a great Lougar, 9 leagues. About the middle
<PB N="488" REF="257"/>
of <HI>Sierra Morena</HI> are the bounds of <HI>Castilia nova</HI> and
<HI>Andaluzia.</HI></P>
<P>We passed by <HI>Caraquol,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Octob. 30</NOTE> <HI>Cividad real</HI> and lay at
<HI>Malagon,</HI> 10 leagues. Between <HI>Malagon</HI> and <HI>Cividad
real</HI> we passed over the river <HI>Anas</HI> now called <HI>Gua∣diana,</HI>
which was there but a little brook. In this
days journey we met with a great many great flocks
of sheep and goats going towards the <HI>Sierra Morena</HI>
out of <HI>Castile:</HI> it being the custom all Summer to
feed their sheep upon the mountains of <HI>Castile,</HI> and
in Winter in the <HI>Sierra Morena.</HI></P>
<P>We passed by the ruines of an Aqueduct about 4
leagues from <HI>Malagon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE> then <HI>Yvenas</HI> a good big lou∣gar,
and lay at <HI>Orgas;</HI> 10 leagues.</P>
<P>We passed through <HI>Toledo</HI> and lay at <HI>Esquinas</HI>
11 leagues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1.</NOTE> As soon as ever we were passed the <HI>Si¦erra
Morena</HI> we felt a great change of weather, the
warm air that comes from <HI>Afric</HI> and the <HI>Mediterra∣nean</HI>
Sea being stopped by the interposition of the
mountains This day there was heer a hard frost
and pretty thick ice. The most considerable things
in <HI>Toledo</HI> are 1. The bridge over <HI>Tagus</HI> consisting of
but two arches, one great one and one little one.
2. The shambles, where notwithstanding the cold∣ness
of the day I saw abundance of flies, which con∣futes
the story that there is but one great fly there all
the year. 3. The great Church, where there are
many monuments of Bishops, but without inscri∣ptions;
in the <HI>Capella maggior</HI> lie interred two Kings,
and in the <HI>Capella de los Res</HI> four Kings. 4. The
Kings palace. 5. The ruines of a famous Engine to
raise up water to the Kings Palace. There is so little
of it remaining that it is impossible thence to find out
all the contrivance and intrigue of it.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Toledo</HI> and <HI>Madrid</HI> the Countrey is ve∣ry
populous and the soil very good. All along the
road from <HI>Sevil</HI> to <HI>Madrid</HI> the common fare is Rab∣bets,

dear.</P>
<P><PB N="489" REF="257"/>
We arrived at <HI>Madrid;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> 6 leagues near the Town
we passed over the river <HI>Xarante. Madrid</HI> is very po∣pulous,
well built with good brick houses, many
having glass windows, which is worth the noting,
because you shall scarce see any in all <HI>Spain</HI> besides.
The streets are very foul and nasty. There is one ve∣ry
fair <HI>piazza</HI> or market place, encompassed round
with tall an uniform houses, having 5 rows of

1. The bridge over the river <HI>Relarzon.</HI> 2. The gate
at the end of the bridge, where are the statues of
<HI>Charles</HI> V; of <HI>Janus Calvus;</HI> of <HI>Diego Porcellero:</HI>

<P>We passed by <HI>Pancorva,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE> a place very famous for
good water, <HI>Miranda</HI> a great Town, where there
is a good bridge over the river <HI>Iberus,</HI> and after that

<HI>Haec est victoria quae vincit;</HI> 4 leagues. <HI>Vit∣toria</HI>
is the chief City of a little Countrey called
<HI>Alaba.</HI> We passed this day by <HI>Salines</HI> the first Town
of <HI>Guipuscoa</HI> and lay at <HI>Aescurias;</HI> 9 leagues. In <HI>Gui∣puscoa</HI>
they pay no taxes or other duties to the King
without the consent of the Countrey. The whole
Province is more commonly called <HI>Provincia</HI> than
<HI>Guipuscoa;</HI> it is cantoned out into a great many Cor∣porations
and Villages, every one of which send 1,
2 or 3 Representatives to the general meeting when
there is any public business. All offices are annual,
and chosen diversly according to the differing cu∣stoms
of the Towns. The chief Officer in each
town to determine all civil and criminal causes is the
<HI>Alcalda;</HI> but from him they may appeal to the Go∣vernour
of the Province, sent by the King every
third year; and from the Governour to the Kings
Council at <HI>Valladolid.</HI> Next to the <HI>Alcalda</HI> are 2
<HI>Regidores</HI> to look after the prices of all commodi∣ties;
a <HI>Bolser</HI> for the treasury; a <HI>Medino</HI> for the pri∣son,
<HI>Argozils</HI> or Serjeants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They boast that they
are the walls of <HI>Spain,</HI> and therefore have many
priviledges. <HI>Guipuscoa</HI> is under the Bishop of <HI>Pam∣pelona.</HI>
In <HI>Guipuscoa</HI> and <HI>Biscay</HI> they have a pecu∣liar
language of their own, and therefore send
their children to School to learn <HI>Spanish,</HI> (which
<PB N="491" REF="258"/>
they call <HI>Romance</HI>) as we do ours to learn <HI>Latin.</HI>
The Searchers having hindred us we were forced to
travel great way in the night. We were lighted by
<HI>Tias</HI> or <HI>Teas,</HI> which burnt as well and gave as good
a light as torches. When they went out they tossed
them up and down in their hands, which kindled
them again. These <HI>Teas</HI> (so called doubtless from
the <HI>Latin</HI> word <HI>taeda</HI>) are very commonly used in
this Countrey, and are nothing else but bastons of
wood hacked and cleft, (but so as the pieces hang
together) and afterwards soundly dried in an Oven
or Chimney. Along the middle they use to cleave
them almost quite asunder. They are made of seve∣ral
sorts of wood, of <HI>Robla,</HI> i. e. Oak, <HI>Aiga,</HI> i. e.
but the best of <HI>Avellana,</HI> i. e.
Hazel. <HI>I wonder much at this, unless they have some
way of preparing the wood, by steeping it in oil or other
inflammable matter. The taedae of the Ancients were
made only of the trunks of old and sappy pines.</HI></P>
<P>We passed by <HI>Mondragone,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE> where there is a <HI>fa∣brica</HI>
of Arms for the King, <HI>Oniate, Legaspa, Villa
real,</HI> and lay at <HI>Villa franca;</HI> 7 leagues. We left S.
<HI>Adrian,</HI> which is the ordinary road, a little on our
left hand. This Countrey is very populous and well
wooded, all the hills being covered with oaks.
They use no ploughs but turn over the ground with
tridents of iron; 4 or 5 of them working together,
and thrusting in their tridents all together, turn up
a yard or two of earth at a time, which they after∣wards
dress and level like beds in a garden. The peo∣ple
are something better conditioned than the <HI>Spa∣niards;</HI>
richer and far more populous. 1. Because
there is a better government and greater liberty.
2. There is abundance of wood and iron. 3. More
rain than in the other parts of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>We passed <HI>Tolosa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">13.</NOTE> and arrived this night at <HI>S. Se∣bastian,</HI>
having travelled 8 leagues. The most ob∣servable
things in S. <HI>Sebastian</HI> are 1. The walls and
<PB N="492" REF="259"/>
guns. 2. A great Convent of Dominican Freres in
which there is a famous pair of stone-stairs, each
step being of one entire stone and supported only on
one side. 3. The haven The Government of S. <HI>Se∣bastian</HI>
consists of a great Council of all that have
one or more houses and are married, but none can
bear office unless he have two houses, of these there
is not above 150 or 200, though the town be very
populous conteining about 24000 souls. Once in a
year all the names of this 150 or 200 are put into an
urn, and a child takes out 8 to be Electors. Every
one of this 8 chuses his man. the old Magistrates
that are just then going out divide these 8 that the
Electors have chosen into 4 pairs, fitting them as
well as they can, <HI>v. g.</HI> an old man and a young to∣gether,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> These 4 pairs are put into an urn. The
first pair that are drawn out are the two <HI>Alcaldas</HI>
for
that year; the second pair the two Deputy <HI>Alcal∣das;</HI>
the third pair the two <HI>Regidores</HI> the fourth pair
the two Deputy <HI>Regidores.</HI> In much the same man∣ner
they chuse two Jurats, one Syndic or Atturney
general, one Treasurer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all these Officers make
a lesser Senate; but in businesses of importance the
whose number meets. There is no distinction of
<HI>Nobiles</HI> and <HI>Plebeii;</HI> but all that are descended from
<HI>Guipuscoans,</HI> that are married and have one house
are in capacity to be Electors; all that have two
houses to be Magistrates. The Jurats places are most
desired, there being a great many Ecclesiastical pre∣ferments
belonging to the Town, the disposition
whereof when they come to be vacant is in them,
who usually bestow them upon their Relations and
Friends.</P>
<P>Every Winter there are several whales caught up∣on
this coast, they coming hither in Winter and
frequenting heer, as they do upon the coast of
<HI>Groenland</HI> in Summer. They catch them by striking
them with a harping iron, after the same manner as
<PB N="493" REF="259"/>
they do Sword-fish upon the coast of <HI>Calabria,</HI> and
<HI>Sicily.</HI> Abundance of Cider made about S. <HI>Sebastian</HI>
and <HI>Bayonne.</HI></P>
<P>From S. <HI>Sebastian</HI> I travelled through <HI>Orogna,
Irun,</HI> on the left hand of which is <HI>Fontarabia</HI> a strong
Fort just on the Frontiers of <HI>Spain.</HI> About 1½ league
from <HI>Irun</HI> is the river that parts <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI>
In the middle of this river is an Island where the
Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> met, when <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV
the present King married <HI>Philip</HI> the IV his daughter.
The island was divided just in the middle, and a
house built so that at the table where they sate to eat,
the King of <HI>France</HI> sate in <HI>France,</HI> and the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> is in many places, not to say most, very thin
of people, and almost desolate. The causes are
1. A bad Religion. 2. The tyrannical Inquisition.
3. The multitude of Whores. 4. The barrenness
of the Soil. 5. The wretched laziness of the peo∣ple,
very like the <HI>Welsh</HI> and <HI>Irish,</HI> walking slowly
and always cumbred with a great Cloke and long
Sword. 6. The expulsion of the Jews and Moors,
the first of which were planted there by the Empe∣rour
<HI>Adrian,</HI> and the latter by the Caliphs after the
Conquest of <HI>Spain.</HI> 7. Wars and Plantations. In
all the Towns especially in the South and West parts
of <HI>Spain</HI> a great many ruines of houses to be seen.
Within a quarter of a league of a Town you begin
to see ground ploughed, else all a wild Countrey,
and nothing but Rosemary, Cistus, Juniper, Laven∣der,
Broom, Lentiscus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> growing in the fields,
and on the hills. Little or no hay any where in <HI>Spain,</HI>
they feeding their mules and horses with straw. At
least one half of <HI>Spain</HI> is mountainous.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are not so abstinent as most people
take them to be, eating the best they can get, and
freely enough if it be at another mans cost: and in
Inns never refusing Partridges, Quails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the
<PB N="494" REF="260"/>
dearness if they have but money. Laziness and sloth
makes them poor, and poverty makes them pinch
their bellies and fare hardly. They seldom mingle
water with their wine, it being a common saying
among them <HI>Vino poco &amp; puro,</HI> though all over
<HI>Spain</HI> the wine is very hot and strong. They delight
much in <HI>Pimentone,</HI> i. e. <HI>Guiny</HI> pepper and mingle it
with all their sauces. In roasting of meat they ne∣ver
use dripping pans but draw the coals just under
the meat, which though it be not so cleanly yet is
the quicker and more thrifty way for saving of few∣el.
They tear Rabbets in sunder with their hands
when they are almost roasted, and stew them in a
pot with water and <HI>Pimentone.</HI> To toast bread they
throw it upon the coals. They long and ask for
every thing they see, to avoid which a Merchant
that travelled with me was wont to put in some
thing into his victuals which they did not love.
They take Tobacco much in snuff, and if one take
out a box of snuff he must give some to all the
company. The best person in the company at
table cuts and tears the meat in pieces, and gives
to every one his share.</P>
<P>They are most impertinently inquisitive, whence
you come? whither you go? what business you
have, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> most horribly rude, insolent and imperi∣ous,
uncivil to strangers, asking them, What do
you come into our Countrey for? we do not go into
yours. [This is to be understood of the middle and
inferiour sort of people, many of the Gentry be∣ing
very civil and well-bred.] Their children are
the most unmannerly and ill-bred of any in the
world. The sons of <HI>French</HI> fathers and <HI>Spanish</HI>
women when they are grown up often turn their
fathers out of doors, having many privileges above
them for being born in <HI>Spain.</HI> They are ex∣tremely
given to lying. <HI>Almuzzos</HI> and such kind
of fellows not to be believed or trusted in any thing
they promise.</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="260"/>
They ride altogether upon mules, and carry their
Portmanteau's before them, for fear they should be
lost or stollen from behind them; they lie between
a high pummel of the saddle and an iron hook.
Instead of stirrops persons of quality use great clogs
of wood of the shape of shooes without heels.
They cut away the mules hair close to the skin under
the Saddles, and Portmanteau's to avoid galling.
Of this bastard breed of Animals the males are usu∣ally
bigger than the females. <HI>Q.</HI> Whether the rea∣son
be that they are always bred of a mare and
an he ass? 2. They piss very often. <HI>Q.</HI> Whether
the reason be the sharpness of their urine or the
smallness of their bladder? 3. They piss almost
always when they go through water. 4. They shooe
them with shooes a great deal broader than their
feet, to prevent I suppose the breaking of their
hoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. Under the mouths of their mules of bur∣then
they usually hang a net with provender in it.
These beasts are better at climbing of mountains
than horses, have a greater courage to endure long
and hard travel, and besides are maintained with
less charge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> seldom ride alone, but stay for a
<HI>troppas</HI> as they do for a Caravan in <HI>Arabia.</HI> The com∣mon
phrases or forms of salutation when they meet
or pass by one another, are, <HI>Garda Dios vostes,</HI> i. e.
<HI>vous autres</HI> [God defend you] <HI>A Dios</HI> [adieu]
<HI>Vaga con Dios</HI> [God go along with you.] When
they are angry <HI>Cornuto,</HI> i. e. Cuckold, is the first
word, and sometimes <HI>Cornutissimo.</HI> When they
speak to their mules or boys they send of errands,
they say, <HI>Anda Cornuto,</HI> [Go Cuckold.] When they
refuse a courtesie, or complement to drink first, go
first or the like, they say, <HI>Non per vita mea,</HI> [no by
my life.] At any thing strange or ridiculous they
cry out, <HI>Cuerpo di Dios</HI> or <HI>di Cristo</HI> [Body of God
or body of Christ.] When they call to one to make
<PB N="496" REF="261"/>
him hear, instead of <HI>Escoutes</HI> in <HI>French,</HI> or <HI>Senti</HI> in
<HI>Italian,</HI> they cry <HI>O-yes</HI> just as our Criers do in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>
When they put off a beggar not giving him
an Alms, they say, <HI>Vostes perdonnè.</HI> [Good friend
pardon or excuse me.]</P>
<P>As for their Religion the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are the most
orthodox and rigid <HI>Romanists</HI> in the world, it be∣ing
a saying among them <HI>Faltando in uno punto à
Dios.</HI> [If you leave the Church in one punctilio,
God be with you, you must needs be damned.] All
over <HI>Spain</HI> there are abundance of pitiful wooden
Crosses set up in the middle of heaps of stone. Un∣der
all the pictures of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> is written
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>i. e.</HI> Con∣ceived without original sin.</NOTE> <HI>Concebida sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peccado originale.</HI> At the Ave-Mary
bell they all fall down upon their knees; whereas
in other Countries they are contented only to pluck
off their hats. When they have done their Devo∣tions,
as also after their meals when they take away,
and when they go to bed they say <HI>Sia lodato il san∣tissimo
Sacramento,</HI> [Praised be the most holy Sacra∣ment.]</P>
<P>For fornication and impurity they are the worst
of all Nations, at least in <HI>Europe;</HI> almost all the
Inns in <HI>Andaluzia, Castile, Granada, Murcia,</HI> &amp;c.
having Whores who dress the meat and do all the bu∣siness.
They are to be hired at a very cheap rate. It
were a shame to mention their impudence, lewd∣ness
and immodest be behaviours and practices. In <HI>Ca∣talonia,
Guipuscoa</HI> and some other places they are
not so bad.</P>
<P>They are so lazy that in their shops they will say
they have not a commodity rather than take pains to
look for it: not to be hired to carry a Portmantean,
go of an errand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but at an excessive rate. Mer∣cers
never tie up any thing they sell, and if they al∣low
paper, they only rudely mumble up the com∣modities
in it. Of their fantastical and ridiculous
pride, and that too in the extremest poverty all
<PB N="497" REF="261"/>
the world rings. If there be any employment
that you would set them about which they think
themselves too good for, they presently say send for
a <HI>French-man.</HI> Indeed the <HI>French</HI> do almost all the
work in <HI>Spain.</HI> All these best shops are kept by
French-men, the best workmen in every kind are
<HI>French,</HI> and I believe near ¼ or ⅕ part of the people
in <HI>Spain</HI> are of that Nation. I have heard some tra∣vellers
say, that should the King of <HI>France</HI> recal all
his Subjects out of <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would ha∣zard
to be all starved to death.</P>
<P>Bread is very scarce and very dear in many places
or <HI>Spain,</HI> because of the barrenness of the soil
and want of rain, but chiefly because of the sloth
of the people in letting a great deal of ground lie
untilled, and in not taking the pains to fetch corn
and bread from those places where there is plenty.
So that in a days journey the price of bread will be
trebled, and in another days journey fall as much
again. This Summer there was a tumult at <HI>Ma∣drid:</HI>
the poor people gathering about the Kings pa∣lace
cried out, Let the King live, but let the ill go∣vernment
die; let exactors die, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> just as they did
at <HI>Nuples</HI> in the rebellion under <HI>Masaniello.</HI> Upon
which the King sent to all the Towns about for
bread-corn, and in two or three days bread was
very plentiful and cheap. All over <HI>Catalonia</HI> bread
was very cheap. The <HI>Spanish</HI> bread is commended
for the best of the world, and well it may be, if as
we have heard, they pick their wheat grain by
grain.</P>
<P>At my being at <HI>Madrid</HI> there was an Engineer
there sent by the Emperour, that had invented a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low, called by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> a <HI>Sembrador,</HI> to
sow corn at equal distances, and one grain in a hole;
the description whereof hath been since published in
the <HI>Philosophical Transactions.</HI></P>
<P>In all kind of good learning the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
<PB N="498" REF="262"/>
behind the rest of <HI>Europe,</HI> understanding nothing at
all but a little of the old wrangling Philosophy and
School-divinity.</P>
<P>The people are much discontented all over <HI>Spain,</HI>
complaining of Taxes, evil Counsellours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but
they have a good opinion of and age generally well-affected
to their King, whose intentions they say
are very good.</P>
<P>As for their habit and dress in that they are to be
commended that they are constant to the same fa∣shions,
though they be not the most convenient
that might be devised. To change for the better I
think it rather commendable than blame-worthy;
but to change out of meer levity or an apish imita∣tion
of others is foolish and unreasonable. They
wear great hats with broad crowns and the top
breader than the bottom. Their hair most com∣monly,
but especially when they travel, they tie up
in a knot behind, aud sometimes braid like womens.
Their bands lie upon black collars just of the same
bigness or a little bigger. They are joyned to the
collar and they put on collar and band together.
They wear very much Cambrick half-shirts, and
have their sleeves open before and behind both Win∣ter
and Summer; they have great skirts upon their
doublets. Their breeches are very streight and close
to their thighs, and buttoned down on each side,
and reach a little lower than the knee. They wear
very slight-wrought black silk-stockins, that the
white linnen-stockings which they wear under∣neath
may be seen through them. Their shooes
just fit for their feet, very light and thin, with low
heels. Over their doublets they wear a close coat or
jerkin with open sleeves like the doublet, and for
the most part with hanging sleeves like childrens,
yet never reaching lower than their skirts: a very
long sword, and a short dagger hanging just behind
them, and at last over all a cloak with a great cape.
<PB N="499" REF="262"/>
The women wear great Vardingales, standing so far
out an each side, that to enter in at an ordinary
door they are fain to go side-ways: when they go
abroad are covered with a vail of black having only
a hole left for one eye. The poor people wear
shooes made of packthread.</P>
<P>The most noble sport in <HI>Spain</HI> is the <HI>Jeu de Tau∣reau,</HI>
or Bull-fighting, practised at <HI>Valentia, Ma∣drid,</HI>
&amp;c. At <HI>Madrid</HI> 3 times in the year, where in
the Market-place a brave Don on horseback, and
a great many pages on foot fight with a wild Bull:
When one Bull is killed or much wounded they turn
in another. Seldom but some of the pages are kil∣led.
And with these cruel and bloody spectacles
the people are much delighted, as were the <HI>Romans</HI>
of old in the time of Heathenism.</P>

of the</HI> Spaniards, <HI>may read Mr.</HI> Galliards <HI>Character

<P>Nec minùs anceps &amp; difficilis quaestio cst, An Plantae

floris autem colore, multiplicitate, &amp;c. variantium mul∣titudo
