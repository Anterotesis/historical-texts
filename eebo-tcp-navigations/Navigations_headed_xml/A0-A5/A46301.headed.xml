<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>NNO Dom.</HI> 1638. <HI>April</HI> the 26th being <HI>Thursday,</HI> I came to <HI>Gravesend</HI> and went aboard the <HI>New Supply, alias,</HI> the <HI>Ni∣cholas</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> a Ship of good force, of 300 Tuns burden, carrying 20 Sacre and Minion, man'd with 48 Sai∣lers, the Master <HI>Robert Taylor,</HI> the Merchant or undertaker Mr. <HI>Edward Tinge,</HI> with 164 Passengers men, women and children.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<P>At <HI>Gravesend</HI> I began my Journal, from whence we departed on the 26. of <HI>April,</HI> about Six of the clock at night, and went down into the <HI>Hope.</HI></P>
<P>The 27. being <HI>Fryday,</HI> we set sail out of the <HI>Hope,</HI> and about Nine of the clock at night we came to an Anchor in <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>garet</HI>-Road in three fathom and a half water: by the way we past a States man of war, of 500 Tun, cast away a month before upon the <HI>Goodwin,</HI> nothing remaining visible a∣bove water but her main mast top, 16 o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her men were drowned, the rest saved by Fishermen.</P>
<P>The 28. we twined into the Downs, where Captain <HI>Clark</HI> one of His Majesties Captains in the Navy, came aboard of us in the afternoon, and prest two of our Trumpeters. Here we had good store of Flounders from the Fishermen, new taken out of the Sea and living, which being rea∣dily gutted, were fry'd while they were warm; me thoughts I never tasted of a delicater Fish in all my life before.</P>
<P>The Third of <HI>May</HI> being <HI>Ascension</HI> day, in the afternoon we weighed out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> the wind at <HI>E.</HI> and ran down into <HI>Dover</HI> Road, and lay by the lee, whilst they sent the Skiffe ashore for one of the Masters mates: by the way we past <HI>Sandwich</HI> in the
<PB N="3" REF="5"/><HI>Hope, Sandown-Castle, Deal,</HI> So we steered a∣way for <HI>Doniesse,</HI> from thence we steered <HI>S. W.</HI> ½ <HI>S.</HI> for the <HI>Beachie,</HI> about one of the clock at night the wind took us a stayes with a gust, rain, thunder and lightning, and now a Servant of one of the passengers sickned of the small pox.</P>
<P>The Fifth day in the afternoon we An∣chored, the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Wight W.N.W.</HI> 10 leagues off, <HI>Beachie E. N. E.</HI> 8 leagues off, rode in 32 fathom-water at low water, at 8 of the clock at night the land over the Needles bore <HI>N. W.</HI> 4 leagues off, we steered <HI>W.</HI> a∣fore the Start, at noon the Boult was <HI>N. W.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> about 3½ leagues off, we were becalmed from 7 of the clock in the morn∣ing, till 12 of the clock at noon, where we took good store of <HI>Whitings,</HI> and half a score <HI>Gurnets,</HI> this afternoon an infinite number of <HI>Porpisces</HI> shewed themselves a∣bove water round about the Ship, as far as we could kenn, the night proved tempestu∣ous with much lightning and thunder.</P>
<P>The Sixth day being <HI>Sunday,</HI> at five of the clock at night the <HI>Lizard</HI> was <HI>N. W.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> 6 leagues off, and the <HI>Blackhead</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to the westward of <HI>Falmouth</HI> was <HI>N. W.</HI> about 5 leagues off.</P>
<P>The Seventh day the uttermost part of <HI>Silly</HI> was <HI>N. E.</HI> 12 leagues off, and now we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egan to sail by the logg.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<P>The Eighth day, one <HI>Boremans</HI> man a passenger was duck'd at the main yards arm (for being drunk with his Masters strong waters which he stole) thrice, and fire given to two whole Sacree, at that instant. Two mighty Whales we now saw, the one spouted water through two great holes in her head into the Air a great height, and making a great noise with pussing and blowing, the Seamen called her a Soutler; the other was further off, about a league from the Ship, fighting with the Sword-fish, and the Flail∣fish, whose stroakes with a fin that growes upon her back like a flail, upon the back of the Whale, we heard with amazement: when presently some more than half as far again we spied a spout from above, it came pouring down like a River of water; So that if they should light in any Ship, she were in danger to be presently sunk down into the Sea, and falleth with such an ex∣tream violence all whole together as one drop, or as water out of a Vessel, and du∣red a quarter of an hour, making the Sea to boyle like a pot, and if any Vessel be near, it sucks it in. I saw many of these spouts afterwards at nearer distance. In the afternoon the Mariners struck a Porpisce, called also a <HI>Marsovius</HI> or Sea-hogg, with an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> harping Iron, and hoisted her aboard,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>they cut some of it into thin pieces, and fryed, it tasts like rusty Bacon, or hung Beef, if not worse; but the Liver boiled and soused sometime in Vinegar is more grateful to the pallat. About 8 of the clock at night, a flame settled upon the main mast, it was about the bigness of a great Candle, and is called by our Seamen St. <HI>Elmes</HI> fire, it comes before a storm, and is commonly thought to be a Spirit; if two appear they prognosticate safety: These are known to the learned by the names of <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pol∣lux,</HI> to the <HI>Italians</HI> by St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> and St. <HI>Hermes,</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> called <HI>Corpos Santes.</HI></P>
<P>The Ninth day, about two of the clock in the afternoon, we found the head of our main mast close to the cap twisted and shive∣red, and we presently after found the fore∣top-mast crackt a little above the cap; So they wolled them both, and about two of the clock in the morning 7 new long Boat oars brake away from our Star-board quar∣ter with a horrid crack.</P>
<P>The Eleventh day, they observed and made the Ship to be in latitude 48 degrees 46 minuts, having a great Sea all night; a∣bout 6 of the clock in the morning we spake with Mr. <HI>Rupe</HI> in a Ship of <HI>Dart∣mouth,</HI> which came from <HI>Marcelloes;</HI> and now is <HI>Silly N. E.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> 34 leagues off;
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>about 9 of the clock at night we sounded, and had 85 fathom water, small brownish pepperie sand, with a small piece of <HI>Hakes</HI> Tooth, and now we are 45 leagues off the <HI>Lizard,</HI> great Seas all night, and now we see to the <HI>S. W.</HI> six tall Ships, the wind be∣ing <HI>S. W.</HI></P>
<P>The Twelfth day being <HI>Whitsunday,</HI> at prayer-time we found the Ships trine a foot by the stern, and also the partie that was sick of the small pox now dyed, whom we buried in the Sea, tying a bullet (as the manner is) to his neck, and another to his leggs, turned him out at a Port-hole, giving fire to a great Gun. In the afternoon one <HI>Martin Jvy</HI> a stripling, servant to Captain <HI>Thomas Cammock</HI> was whipt naked at the Cap-stern, with a Cat with Nine tails, for filching 9 great Lemmons out of the <HI>Chirurgeons</HI> Cabbin, which he eat rinds and all in less than an hours time.</P>
<P>The Thirteenth day we took a Sharke, a great one, and hoisted him aboard with his two Companions (for there is never a Sharke, but hath a mate or two) that is the Pilot fish or Pilgrim, which lay upon his back close to a long finn; the other fish (some what bigger than the Pilot) about two foot long, called a <HI>Remora,</HI> it hath no scales and sticks close for the Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kes belly.
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>So the Whale hath the Sea-gudgeon, a small fish for his mate, marching before him, and guiding him; which I have seen likewise. The Seamen divided the Sharke into quar∣ters, and made more quarter about it than the Purser, when he makes five quarters of an Oxe, and after they had cooked him, he proved very rough Grain'd, not worthy of wholesome preferment; but in the after∣noon we took store of <HI>Bonitoes,</HI> or Spanish <HI>Dolphins,</HI> a fish about the size of a large Mackarel, beautified with admirable varie∣tie of glittering colours in the water, and was excellent food.</P>
<P>The Fourteenth day we spake with a <HI>Plimouth</HI> man (about dinner time) bound for <HI>New-found-land,</HI> who having gone up west-ward sprang a leak, and now bore back for <HI>Plimouth.</HI> Now was <HI>Silly</HI> 50 leagues off, and now many of the passengers fall sick of the small Pox and Calenture.</P>
<P>The Sixteenth Mr. <HI>Clarke,</HI> who came out of the <HI>Downs</HI> with us, and was bound for the Isle of <HI>Providence,</HI> one of the summer Islands; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having taken it a little before, though unknown to <HI>Clarke,</HI> and to Captain <HI>Nathaniel Butler</HI> going Go∣vernour, they now departed from us the Wind <HI>N. W.</HI> great Seas and stormie winds all night.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<P>The Seventeenth day, the wind at <HI>N. W.</HI> about 8 of the clock we saw 5 great Ships bound for the <HI>Channel,</HI> which was to the Westward of us, about two leagues off, we thought them to be <HI>Flemmings;</HI> here we expected to have met with Pirates, but were happily deceived.</P>
<P>The One and twentieth day, the wind <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> great Seas and Wind fu'd our courses, and tryed from 5 of the clock af∣ternoon, till 4 in the morning, the night be∣ing very stormie and dark; we lost Mr. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odlad</HI> and his Ship, who came out with us, and bound for <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>The Eight and twentieth day, all this while a very great grown Sea and mighty winds.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the first day in the afternoon, very thick foggie weather, we sailed by an in∣chanted Island, saw a great deal of filth and rubbish floating by the Ship, heard <HI>Cawdi∣mawdies, Sea-gulls</HI> and <HI>Crowes,</HI> (Birds that alwayes frequent the shoar) but could see nothing by reason of the mist: towards Sun∣set, when we were past the Island, it cleared up.</P>
<P>The Fourteenth day of <HI>June,</HI> very fog∣gie weather, we sailed by an Island of Ice (which lay on the Star-board side) three leagues in length mountain high, in form of
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>land, with Bayes and Capes like high clift land, and a River pouring off it into the Sea. We saw likewise two or three Foxes, or Devils skipping upon it. These Islands of Ice are congealed in the North, and brought down in the spring-time with the Current to the banks on this side <HI>New-found-land,</HI> and there stopt, where they dissolve at last to water; by that time we had sailed half way by it, we met with a <HI>French</HI> Pickeroon. Here it was as cold as in the middle of <HI>Ja∣nuary</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and so continued till we were some leagues beyond it.</P>
<P>The Sixteenth day we sounded, and found 35 fathom water, upon the bank of <HI>New-found-land,</HI> we cast our our hooks for Cod-fish, thick foggie weather, the Codd being taken on a Sanday morning, the Se∣ctaries aboard threw those their servants took into the Sea again, although they wanted fresh victuals, but the Sailers were not so nice, amongst many that were taken, we had some that were wasted Fish, &amp; it is observable and very strange, that fishes bo∣dies do grow slender with age, their Tails and Heads retaining their former bigness; Fish of all Creatures have generally the biggest heads, and the first part that begins to taint in a fish is the head.</P>
<P>The Nineteenth day, Captain <HI>Thomas
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>Cammock</HI> (a near kinsman of the Earl of <HI>Warwicks</HI>) now had another lad <HI>Thomas Jones,</HI> that dyed of the small pox at eight of the clock at night.</P>
<P>The Twentieth day, we saw a great number of Sea-bats, or Owles, called also flying fish, they are about the bigness of a Whiting, with sour tinsel wings, with which they fly as long as they are wet, when pursued by other fishes. Here like∣wise we saw many Grandpisces or Herring∣hogs, hunting the scholes of Herrings, in the afternoon we saw a great fish called the <HI>vehuella</HI> or Sword fish, having a long, strong and sharp finn like a Sword-blade on the top of his head, with which he pierced our Ship, and broke it off with striving to get loose, one of our Sailers dived and brought it aboard.</P>
<P>The One and twentieth day, we met with two <HI>Bristow</HI> men bound for <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> and now we are 100 and 75 leagues off <HI>Cape-Sable,</HI> the sandy <HI>Cape,</HI> for so <HI>Sable</HI> in French signifieth, off of which ly∣eth the Isle of <HI>Sable,</HI> which is beyond <HI>New-found-land,</HI> where they take the <HI>Amphibious</HI> Creature, the <HI>Walrus, Mors,</HI> or <HI>Sea-Horse.</HI></P>
<P>The Two and twentieth, another passen∣ger dyed of a Consumption. Now we passed by the Southern part of <HI>New-found-land,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>within sight of it; the Southern part of <HI>New-found-land</HI> is said to be not above 600 leagues from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Six and twentieth day, Capt. <HI>Thomas Cammock</HI> went aboard of a Barke of 300 Tuns, laden with Island Wine, and but 7 men in her, and never a Gun, bound for <HI>Richmonds</HI> Island, set out by Mr. <HI>Trelaney</HI> of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> exceeding hot weather now.</P>
<P>The Eight and twentieth, one of Mr. <HI>Edward Ting's</HI> the undertakers men now dyed of the Phthisick.</P>
<P>The Nine and twentieth day, sounded at night, and found 120 fathome water, the head of the Ship struck against a rock; At 4 of the clock we descryed two sail bound for <HI>New-found-land,</HI> and so for the <HI>Streights,</HI> they told us of a general Earth-quake in <HI>New-England,</HI> of the Birth of a Monster at <HI>Boston,</HI> in the <HI>Massachusets-Bay</HI> a mortality, and now we are two leagues off <HI>Cape Aun.</HI></P>
<P>The Thirtieth day proved stormie, and having lost the sight of Land, we saw none untill the morning; doubtfully discovering the Coast, fearing the Lee-shore all night we bore out to Sea.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the first day, we founded at 8 of the clock at night, and found 93 fathome water, descried land.</P>
<P>The Third day, we Anchored in the <HI>Bay</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>of <HI>Massachusets</HI> before <HI>Boston.</HI> Mr. <HI>Tinges</HI> other man now dyed of the small pox.</P>
<P>The Tenth day, I went a shore upon <HI>Noddles</HI> Island to Mr. <HI>Samuel Maverick</HI> (for my passage) the only hospitable man in all the Countrey, giving entrtainment to all Comers <HI>gratis.</HI></P>
<P>Now before I proceed any further, it will not be Impertinent to give the intend∣ing planter some Instructions for the fur∣nishing of himself with things necessary, and for undertaking the Transport of his Family, or any others.</P>
<P>To which end observe, that a Ship of 150 Tuns, with 2 Decks and a half, and 26 men, with 12 pieces of Ordnance, the charge will amount <HI>per</HI> moneth, with the Mariners, to 120 pound <HI>per</HI> moneth. It is better to let the Owners undertake for the Victualling of the Mariners, and their pay for Wages, and the Transporter only to take care of the passengers.</P>

<P>Having refreshed my self for a day or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo upon <HI>Noddles-Island,</HI> I crossed the Bay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in a small Boat to <HI>Boston,</HI> which then was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather a Village, than a Town, there being
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>not above Twenty or thirty houses; and presenting my respects to Mr. <HI>Winthorpe</HI> the Governour, and to Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> the Teacher of <HI>Boston</HI> Church, to whom I deli∣vered from Mr. <HI>Francis Quarles</HI> the poet, the Translation of the 16, 25, 51, 88, 113, and 137. Psalms into <HI>English</HI> Meeter, for his approbation, being civilly treated by all I had occasion to converse with, I returned in the Evening to my lodging.</P>
<P>The Twelfth day of <HI>July,</HI> after I had taken my leave of Mr. <HI>Maverick,</HI> and some other Gentlemen, I took Boat for the Eastern parts of the Countrie, and arrived at <HI>Black point</HI> in the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> which is 150 miles from <HI>Boston,</HI> the Fourteenth day, which makes my voyage 11 weeks and odd dayes.</P>
<P>The Countrey all along as I sailed, being no other than a meer Wilderness, here and there by the Sea-side a few scattered planta∣tions, with as few houses.</P>
<P>About the Tenth of <HI>August,</HI> I hapned to walk into the Woods, not far from the Sea-side, and falling upon a piece of ground over-grown with bushes, called there black Currence, but distring from our Garden Currence, they being ripe and hanging in lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y bunches; I set up my piece against a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ly Oake, with a resolution to fill my
<PB N="21" REF="14"/>belly, being near half a mile from the house; of a sudden I heard a hollow thumping noise upon the Rocks approach∣ing towards me, which made me presently to recover my piece, which I had no sooner cock'd, than a great and grim over-grown she-Wolf appears, at whom I shot, and finding her Gor-belly stuft with flesh newly taken in, I began presently to suspect that she had fallen foul upon our Goats, which were then valued (our she Goats) at Five pound a Goat; Therefore to make further discovery, I descended (it being low wa∣ter) upon the Sea sands, with an intent to walk round about a neck of land where the Goats usually kept. I had not gone far before I found the footing of two Wolves, and one Goat betwixt them, whom they had driven into a hollow, betwixt two Rocks, hither I followed their footing, and perceiving by the Crowes, that there was the place of slaughter, I hung my piece up∣on my back, and upon all four clambered up to the top of the Rock, where I made ready my piece and shot at the dog Wolf, who was feeding upon the remainder of the Goat, which was only the fore shoulders, head and horns, the rest being devoured by the she-Wolf, even to the very hair of the Goat: and it is very observable, that when
<PB N="22" REF="15"/>the Wolves have kill'd a Beast, or a Hog, not a Dog-Wolf amongst them offers to eat any of it, till the she-Wolves have fill'd their paunches.</P>
<P>The Twenty fourth of <HI>September,</HI> being Munday about 4 of the clock in the after∣noon, a fearful storm of wind began to rage, called a <HI>Hurricane. It is an impetuous wind that goes commonly about the Compass in the space of</HI> 24 <HI>hours, it began from the</HI> W. N.

<P><HI>December</HI> the Tenth, happened an Eclipse of the Moon at 8 of the clock at night, it continued till after 11, as near as we could guess; in old <HI>England</HI> it began after mid∣night, and continued till 4 of <HI>The clock in the morning; if Seamen would make observation of the time, either of the beginning or ending of the Eclipse, or total darkness of Sun and Moon in all places where they shall happen to be, and confer their observations to some Artist, hereby the longitude of all places might be certainly known, which are now very uncer∣tainly reported to us.</HI></P>
<P>1639. <HI>May,</HI> which fell out to be extream hot and foggie, about the middle of <HI>May</HI> I
<PB N="23" REF="15"/>kill'd within a stones throw of our house, above four score Snakes, some of them as big as the small of my leg, black of colour, and three yards long, with a sharp horn on the tip of their tail two inches in length.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the Six and twentieth day, very stormie, Lightning and Thunder. I heard now two of the greatest and fearfullest thunder-claps that ever were heard, I am confident. At this time we had some neigh∣bouring Gentlemen in our house, who came to welcome me into the Countrey; where amongst variety of discourse they told me of a young Lyon (not long before) kill'd at <HI>Piscataway</HI> by an <HI>Indian,</HI> af a Sea-<HI>Serpeut</HI> or <HI>Snake,</HI> that lay quoiled up like a Cable upon a Rock at <HI>Cape-Ann:</HI> a Boat passing by with <HI>English</HI> aboard, and two <HI>Indians,</HI> they would have shot the <HI>Serpent,</HI> but the <HI>Indians</HI> disswaded them, saying, that if he were not kill'd out-right, they would be all in danger of their lives.</P>
<P>One Mr. <HI>Mittin</HI> related of a <HI>Triton</HI> or <HI>Mereman</HI> which he saw in <HI>Cascebay,</HI> the Gentleman was a great Fouler, and used to goe out with a small Boat or Canow, and fetching a compass about a small Island, (there being many small Islands in the Bay) for the advantage of a shot, was encountred
<PB N="24" REF="16"/>with a <HI>Triton,</HI> who laying his hands upon the side of the Canow, had one of them chopt off with a Hatchet by Mr. <HI>Mittin,</HI> which was in all respects like the hand of a man, the <HI>Triton</HI> presently sunk, dying the water with his purple blood, and was no more seen. The next story was told by Mr. <HI>Foxwell,</HI> now living in the province of <HI>Main,</HI> who having been to the Eastward in a Shallop, as far as <HI>Cape-Ann</HI>-a Waggon in his return was overtaken by the night, and fearing to land upon the barbarous shore, he put off a little further to Sea; about mid∣night they were wakened with a loud voice from the shore, calling upon <HI>Foxwell, Foxwell</HI> come a shore, two or three times: upon the Sands they saw a great fire, and Men and Women hand in hand dancing round about it in a ring, after an hour or two they va∣nished, and as soon as the day appeared, <HI>Foxwell</HI> puts into a small <HI>Cove,</HI> it being about three quarters floud, and traces along the shore, where he found the footing of Men, Women and Children shod with shoos; and an infinite number of brands-ends thrown up by the water, but neither <HI>Indian</HI> nor <HI>English</HI> could he meet with on the shore, nor in the woods; these with many other stories they told me, the credit whereof I will neither impeach nor inforce, but sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>satisfie my self, and I hope the Reader here∣of, with the saying of a wise, learned and honourable Knight, <HI>that there are many stranger things in the world, than are to be seen between</HI> London <HI>and</HI> Stanes.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the Sixth day, one Mr. <HI>John Hickford</HI> the Son of Mr. <HI>Hickford</HI> a Linnen-Draper in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> having been sometime in the province of <HI>Main,</HI> and now determi∣ned to return for <HI>England,</HI> sold and kill'd his stock of Cattle and Hoggs, one great Sow he had which he made great account of, but being very fat, and not suspecting that she was with pig, he caused her to be kill'd, and they sound 25 pigs within her belly; verifying the old proverb, As fruitful as a white sow. And now we were told of a sow in <HI>Virginia</HI> that brought forth six pigs, their fore-parts Lyons, their hinder-parts hogs. <HI>I have read that at</HI> Bruxels, Anno 1564. <HI>a sow brought forth six pigs, the first whereof (for the last in generating is alwayes in bruit beasts the first brought forth) had the head, face, arms and legs of a man, but the whole trunck of the body from the neck, was of a swin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, a sodomitical monster is more like the mother than the father in the or∣gans of the vegetative soul.</HI></P>
<P>The Three and twentieth, I left <HI>Black-point,</HI> and came to <HI>Richmonds</HI> Island about
<PB N="26" REF="17"/>three leagues to the Eastward, where Mr. <HI>Tralanie</HI> kept a fishing, Mr. <HI>John Winter</HI> a grave and discreet man was his Agent, and imployer of 60 men upon that design.</P>
<P>The Four and twentieth day being <HI>Mun∣day,</HI> I went aboard the <HI>Fellowship</HI> of 100 and 70 Tuns a Flemish bottom, the Master <HI>George Luxon</HI> of <HI>Bittiford</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> se∣veral of my friends came to bid me fare∣well, among the rest Captain <HI>Thomas Wan∣nerton</HI> who drank to me a pint of kill-de∣vil <HI>alias</HI> Rhum at a draught, at 6 of the clock in the morning we weighed Anchor, and set sail for the <HI>Massachusets-bay.</HI></P>
<P>The Seven and twentieth day being <HI>Fry∣day,</HI> we Anchored in the afternoon in the <HI>Massachusets-bay</HI> before <HI>Boston.</HI> Next day I went aboard of Mr. <HI>Hinderson,</HI> Master of a ship of 500 Tuns, and Captain <HI>Jackson</HI> in the Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI> a privateer, and from thence I went ashore to <HI>Boston,</HI> where I refreshed my self at an Ordinary. Next morning I was invited to a fishermans house somewhat lower within the <HI>Bay,</HI> and was there by his Wife presented with a hand∣ful of small Pearl, but none of them bored nor orient. From thence I crost the Bay to <HI>Charles-town,</HI> where at one <HI>Longs</HI> Ordinary I met with Captain <HI>Jackson</HI> and others, walking on the back side we spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a rattle
<PB N="27" REF="17"/>Snake a yard and half long, and as thick in the middle as the small of a mans leg, on the belly yellow, her back spotted with black, russet, yellow and green, placed like scales, at her tail she had a rattle which is nothing but a hollow shelly bussiness joynt∣ed, look how many years old she is, so ma∣ny rattles she hath in her tail, her neck seem∣ed to be no bigger than ones Thumb; yet she swallowed a live Chicken, as big as one they give 4 pence for in <HI>England,</HI> presently as we were looking on. In the afternoon I returned to our Ship, being no sooner aboard but we had the sight of an <HI>Indian</HI>-Pinnace sailing by us made of <HI>Birch-bark,</HI> scwed together with the roots of <HI>spruse</HI> and white <HI>Cedar</HI> (drawn out into threads) with a deck, and trimmed with sails top and top gallant very sumptuously.</P>
<P>The Thirtieth day of <HI>September,</HI> I went ashore upon <HI>Noddles</HI>-Island, where when I was come to Mr. <HI>Mavericks</HI> he would not let me go aboard no more, until the Ship was ready to set sail; the next day a grave and sober person described the Monster to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, that was born at <HI>Boston</HI> of one Mrs. <HI>Dyer</HI> a great Sectarie, <HI>the Nine and twentieth of</HI> June, <HI>it was (it should seem) without a head, but having horns like a Beast, and ears, scales on a rough skin like a fish

<P>The Second of <HI>October,</HI> about 9 of the clock in the morning, Mr. <HI>Mavericks</HI> Negro woman came to my chamber window, and in her own Countrey language and tune sang very loud and shril, going out to her, she used a great deal of respect towards me, and willingly would have expressed her grief in <HI>English;</HI> but I apprehended it by her countenance and deportment, whereup∣on I repaired to my host, to learn of him the cause, and resolved to intreat him in her behalf, for that I understood before, that she had been a Queen in her own Countrey, and observed a very humble and dutiful garb used towards her by another Negro who was her maid. Mr. <HI>Maverick</HI> was desirous to have a breed of Negroes, and therefore seeing she would not yield by perswasions to company with a Negro young man he had in his house; he com∣manded him will'd she nill'd she to go to bed to her, which was no sooner done but she kickt him out again, this she took in high disdain beyond her slavery, and this was the cause of her grief. In the after∣noon I walked into the Woods on the back side of the house, and happening into a
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>fine broad walk (which was a sledg-way) I wandered till I chanc't to spye a fruit as I thought like a pine Apple plated with scales, it was as big as the crown of a Wo∣mans hat; I made bold to step unto it, with an intent to have gathered it, no soo∣ner had I toucht it, but hundreds of Wasps were about me; at last I cleared my self from them, being slung only by one upon the upper lip, glad I was that I scaped so well; But by that time I was come into the house my lip was swell'd so extreamly, that they hardly knew me but by my Gar∣ments.</P>
<P>The Tenth of <HI>October,</HI> I went aboard and we fell down to <HI>Nantascot,</HI> here Mr. <HI>Davies</HI> (Mr. <HI>Hicks</HI> the Apothecarie in <HI>Fleet-streets</HI> Son-in-law) dyed of the Phthisick a∣board on a Sunday in the afternoon. The next day Mr. <HI>Luxon</HI> our Master having been ashore upon the Governours Island gave me half a score very fair Pippins which he brought from thence, there being not one Apple-tree, nor Pear planted yet in no part of the Countrey, but upon that Island.</P>
<P>The Fifteenth day, we set sail from <HI>Nan∣tascot.</HI></P>
<P>The Sixteenth day Mr. <HI>Robert Foster,</HI> one of our passengers Preached aboard upon

<P>The Seventeenth day, towards Sun-set a Lanner settled upon our main Mast-top, when it was dark I hired one of the Sailers to fetch her down, and I brought her into <HI>England</HI> with much ado, being fain to feed her with hard Eggs. After this day we had very cold weather at Sea, our deck in a morning ore-spread with hoarie frost, and dangling Isickles hung upon the Ropes. <HI>Some say the Sea is hotter in winter, than in summer; but I did not find it so.</HI></P>
<P><HI>November</HI> the Fifth day, about three of the clock in the afternoon, the Mariners observed the rising of a little black cloud in the <HI>N.

<P>The storm augmenting still, the next day about 4 of the clock afternoon we lost our Rudder, and with that our hopes, so necessary a part it is, that a ship without it, is like a wild horse without a bridle; yet <HI>Aristotle</HI> that <HI>Eag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI>-ey'd <HI>Philosopher could not give a reason, why so small a thing as a Helm should rule the ship.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Second VOYAGE.</HEAD>

<PB N="34" REF="21"/>with little or no advantage, but rather to my loss and detriment. In the setting down, whereof I purpose not to insist in a metho∣dical way, but according to my quality, in a plain and brief relation as I have done al∣ready; for I perceive, if I used all the Art that possibly I could, it would be difficult to please all, for all mens eyes, ears, faith, judgement, are not of a size. There be a sort of stagnant stinking spirits, who, like flyes, lye sucking at the botches of carnal plea∣sures, and never travelled so much Sea, as is between. <HI>Heth-ferry,</HI> and <HI>Lyon-Key;</HI> yet notwithstanding, (sitting in the Chair of the scornful over their whists and draughts of intoxication) will desperately censure the relations of the greatest Travellers. It was a good <HI>proviso</HI> of a learned man, never to report wonders, for in so doing, of the greatest he will be sure not to be believed, but laughed at, which certainly bewraies their ignorance and want of discretion. Of Fools and Mad-men then I shall take no care, I will not invite these in the least to honour me with a glance from their super∣cilious eyes; but rather advise them to keep their inspection for their fine-tongu'd Romances, and playes. This homely piece, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> protest ingenuously, is prepared for such only who well know how to make use of their
<PB N="35" REF="21"/>charitable constructions towards works of this nature, to whom I submit my self in all my faculties, and proceed in my second voyage.</P>

<P><HI>July</HI> the sixth, calm now for two or three dayes, our men went out to swim, some hoisted the <HI>Shallop</HI> out and took divers Turtles, there being an infinite number of them all over the Sea as far as we could ken, and a man may ken at Sea in a clear Air 20 miles, they floated upon the top of the water being a sleep, and driving gently upon them with the <HI>Shallop,</HI> of a sudden
<PB N="38" REF="23"/>they took hold of their hinder legs and lifted them into the boat, if they be not very nimble they awake and presently dive under water; when they were brought aboard they sob'd and wept exceedingly, continuing to do so till the next day that we killed them, by chopping off their heads, and having taken off their shells (that on their back being fairest, is called a Gally patch) we opened the body and took out three hearts in one case, and (which was more strange) we perceived motion in the hearts ten hours after they were taken out.

Of the Sea Turtles there be five sorts, first the Trunck-turtle which is biggest, Secondly, the Loggerhead-turtle. Thirdly, the Hawk∣bill-turtle, which with its bill will bite hor∣ribly. Fourthly, the Green-turtle which is best for food, it is affirmed that the feeding upon this Turtle for a twelve moneth, for∣bearing all other kind of food will cure absolutely Consumptions, and the great pox; They are a very delicate food, and their Eggs are very wholesome and restora∣tive, it is an <HI>Amphibious</HI> Creature going ashore, the male throws the female on her back when he couples with her, which is termed cooting, their Eggs grown to per∣fection the female goes ashore again and making a hole in the Sand, there layes her Eggs which are numerous, I have seen a peck
<PB N="40" REF="24"/>of Eggs taken out of one Turtle; when they have laid they cover the hole again with sand, and return to the Sea never looking after her Eggs, which hatching in the sand and coming to some strength break out and repair to the Sea.

<P><HI>Comets (say Naturalists) proceed from na∣tural causes, but they oft preceed preternatu∣ral effects.

<PB N="51" REF="30"/>Sublunary exhalations, and Cometae, which are heavenly bodies, coevous with the Stars; the cause of the inequality of whose motion, is their Apoge and Periges.

In <HI>England</HI> most of the cold winds and weathers come from the Sea, and those seats that are nearest the Sea-coasts in <HI>England</HI> are accounted unwholsome, but not so in <HI>New England,</HI> for in the extremity of winter the <HI>North-East</HI> and <HI>South</HI>-wind coming from the Sea produceth warm weather, only the <HI>North-West</HI>-wind coming over land from the white mountains (which are alwayes (ex∣cept in <HI>August</HI>) covered with snow) is the cause of extream cold weather, alwayes ac∣companied with deep snowes and bitter frosts, the snow for the most part four and six foot deep, which melting on the superficies with the heat of the Sun, (for the most part shining out clearly every day) and freezing again in the night makes a crust upon the snow sufficient to bear a man walk∣ing with snow-shoos upon it. And at this
<PB N="56" REF="33"/>season the <HI>Indians</HI> go forth on hunting of Dear and Moose twenty, thirty, forty miles up into the Countrie. Their Summer is hot and dry proper for their <HI>Indian</HI> Wheat; which thrives best in a hot and dry season, the skie for the most part Summer and Win∣ter very clear and serene; if they see a little black cloud in the <HI>North-West,</HI> no bigger than a man may cover with his Hat, they expect a following storm, the cloud in short time spreading round about the Ho∣rizon accompanied with violent gusts of wind, rain, and many times lightning and terrible thunder. In all Countries they have observations how the weather will fall out, and these rules following are observable in <HI>New-England.</HI> If the Moon look bright and fair, look for fair weather, also the ap∣pearing of one Rainbow after a storm, is a known sign of fair weather; if mists come down from the Hills, or descend from the Heavens, and settle in the valleys, they pro∣mise fair hot weather; mists in the Eve∣ning shew a fair hot day on the morrow: the like when mists rise from waters in the Evening. The obscuting of the smaller Stars is a certain sign of Tempests approach∣ing; the oft changing of the wind is also a fore-runner of a storm; the resounding of the Sea from the shore, and murmuring of
<PB N="57" REF="33"/>the winds in the woods without apparent wind, sheweth wind to follow: shooting of the Stars (as they call it) is an usual sign of wind from that quarter the Star came from. So look whether the resounding of the Sea upon the shore be on the <HI>East</HI> or <HI>West</HI> side of the dwelling, out of that quarter will the wind proceed the next day. The red∣ness of the sky in the morning, is a token of winds, or rain or both: if the Circles that appear about the Sun be red and broken, they portend wind; if thick and dark, wind, snow and rain; the like may be said of the Circles about the moon. If two rain∣bow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s appear, they are a sign of rain; If the Sun or Moon look pale, look for rain; if a dark cloud be at Sun rising, in which the Sun soon after is hid, it will dissolve it, and rain will follow; <HI>nebula ascendens indi∣cat imbres, nebula descendens serenitatem.</HI> If the Sun seem greater in the <HI>East,</HI> than in the <HI>West</HI> about Sun-setting, and that there appears a black cloud, you may expect rain that night, or the day following.</P>

<P>To conclude; if the white hills look clear and conspicuous, it is a sign of fair weather; if black and cloudy, of rain; if yellow, it is a certain sign of snow shortly to ensue.</P>
<P>In <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1667. <HI>March,</HI> appeared a sign in the Heavens in the form of a Sphear, pointing directly to the <HI>West:</HI> and in the year following on the third day of <HI>April</HI> being <HI>Friday,</HI> there was a terrible Earth∣quake, before that a very great one in 1638. and another in 58 and in 166 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/3. <HI>January</HI> 26, 27, &amp; 28.

Earthquakes are frequent in the Countrie; some suppose that the white mountains were first raised by Earthquakes, they are hollow as may be guessed by the resounding of the rain upon the level on the top. The <HI>Indians</HI> told us of a River whose course was not only stopt by an Earthquake in 1668. (as near as I can remember) but the whole River swallowed up.

<P>The plants in <HI>New England</HI> for the va∣riety, number, beauty, and vertues, may stand in Competition with the plants of any Countrey in Europe. <HI>Johnson</HI> hath added to <HI>Gerard</HI>'s Herbal 300. and <HI>Parkinson</HI> men∣tioneth many more; had they been in <HI>New England</HI> they might have found 1000 at least never heard of nor seen by any <HI>Englishman</HI> before: 'Tis true, the Countrie hath no <HI>Bonerets,</HI> or <HI>Tartarlambs,</HI> no glitte∣ring coloured <HI>Tuleps;</HI> but here you have the <HI>American Mary Gold,</HI> the <HI>Earth-nut</HI> bearing a princely Flower, the beautiful leaved <HI>Pirola,</HI> the honied <HI>Colibry,</HI> &amp;c. They are generally of (somewhat) a more masculine vertue, than any of the same spicies in <HI>England,</HI> but not in so terrible a degree, as to be mischievous or ineffectual to our <HI>English</HI> bodies. <HI>It is affirm by some that no forraign. Drugg or Simple can be so proper to Englishmen as their own, for the quantity of</HI> Opium <HI>which Turks do safely take will kill four Englishmen, and that which will
<PB N="60" REF="35"/>salve their wounds within a day, will not re∣cure an Englishman in three.</HI> To which I answer that it is custom that brings the <HI>Turks</HI> to the familiar use of <HI>Opium.</HI> You may have heard of a <HI>Taylor</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> who being afflicted with want of sleep ventured upon <HI>Opium,</HI> taking at first a grain, and in∣creasing of it till it came to an ounce, which quantitie he took as familiarly as a <HI>Turk,</HI> without any harm, more than that he could not sleep without it. The <HI>English</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> take white <HI>Hellebore,</HI> which operates as fairly with them, as with the <HI>Indians,</HI> who steeping of it in water some∣time, give it to young lads gathered toge∣ther a purpose to drink, if it come up they force them to drink again their vomit, (which they save in a Birchen-dish) till it stayes with them, &amp; he that gets the victory of it is made Captain of the other lads for that year. There is a plant likewise, called for want of a name <HI>Clownes wound wort</HI> by the <HI>English,</HI> though it be not the same, that will heal a green wound in 24 hours, if a wise man have the ordering of it. Thus much for the general, I shall now begin to discover unto you the plants more particu∣larly, and I shall first begin with Trees, and of them, first with such as are called in Scripture Trees of God, that is great
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>Trees, that grow of themselves without planting. Psal. 104.16, 17. <HI>Satiantur arbo∣res Jehovae, cedri libani quas plantavit; (ubi aviculae nidificent) abietes domicilia ciconiae.</HI> The Herons take great delight to sit basking upon the tops of these Trees. And I shall not be over large in any, having written of them in my Treatise of the rarities of <HI>New England,</HI> to which I refer you.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oake</HI> I have given you an account of, and the kinds; I shall add the ordering of Red <HI>Oake</HI> for Wainscot. When they have cut it down and clear'd it from the branch∣es, they pitch the body of the Tree in a muddy place in a River, with the head downward for some time, afterwards they draw it out, and when it is seasoned suffici∣ently, they saw it into boards for Wainscot, and it will branch out into curious works.</P>
<P>There is an admirable rare Creature in shape like a <HI>Buck,</HI> with Horns, of a gummy substance, which I have often found in the fall of the leaf upon the ground amongst the withered leaves; a living Creature I can∣not call it; having only the sign of a mouth and eyes: seldom or never shall you meet with any of them whole, but the head and horns, or the hinder parts, broken off from the rest; the <HI>Indians</HI> call them Tree <HI>Bucks,</HI> and have a superstitious saying (for I believe
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>they never see any of them living) that if they can see a Tree-<HI>Buck</HI> walking upon the branches of an <HI>Oake</HI> when they go out in a morning to hunt, they shall have good luck that day. What they are good for I know not, but certainly there is some more than ordinary vertue in them. It is true that no∣thing in nature is superfluous, and we have the Scripture to back it, that God created nothing in vain. The like Creatures they <HI>have at the</HI> Barbadoes <HI>which they call</HI> Negroes <HI>heads, found in the Sands, about two inches long, with forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, chin, and part of the neck, they are alwayes found loose in the Sands without any root, it is as black as Jet, but whence it comes they know not. I have read likewise, that in the</HI> Cana∣ries <HI>or</HI> Fortunate-Islands, <HI>there is found a cer∣tain Creature, which Boys bring home from the mountains as oft as they would, and named them</HI> Tudesquels, <HI>or little</HI> Germans: <HI>for they were dry'd dead Carcases, almost three footed, which any boy did easily carry in one of the palms of his hand, and they were of an hu∣mane shape; but the whole dead Carcase was clearly like unto Parchment, and their bones were flexible, as it were griftles: against the Sun, also, their bowels and intestines were seen. Surely (saith my Authour) the destroy∣ed race of the</HI> Pigmies <HI>was there.</HI> There is
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>also many times sound upon the leaves of the <HI>Oake</HI> a Creature like a <HI>Frog,</HI> being as thin as a leaf, and transparent, as yellow as Gold, with little fiery red eyes, the <HI>English</HI> call them Tree-frogs or Tree-toads (but of Tree-toads I shall have occasion to speak in another place) they are said to be vene∣mous, but may be safely used, being ad∣mirable to stop womens over-flowing cour∣ses hung about their necks in a Taffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie bag.</P>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Smith <HI>writes that in</HI> New-Eng∣land <HI>there growes a certain berry called</HI> Kermes, <HI>worth</HI> 10 <HI>shillings a pound, and had been formerly sold for</HI> 30 <HI>or</HI> 40 <HI>shillings a pound, which may yearly be gathered in good quantity.</HI> I have sought for this berry, he speaks of, as a man should seek for a needle in a bottle of Hay, but could never light upon it; unless that kind of <HI>Solomon seal</HI> called by the <HI>English</HI> Treacle-berry be it. <HI>Gera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> our famous Herbalist <HI>writes that they grow upon a little Tree called</HI> Scarlet-Oake, <HI>the leaves have one sharp prickle at the end of it; it beareth small</HI> Acorns: <HI>But the grain or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erry growes out of the woody branches, like an excrescence of the substance of the</HI> Oake-Apple, <HI>and of the bigness of Pease, at first white, when ripe of an</HI> Ash-colour, <HI>which in∣genders little Maggots, which when it begins
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>to have wings are put into a bag and boulted up and down till dead, and then made up into lumps, the Maggot as most do deem is</HI> Cutche∣nele; <HI>So that</HI> Chermes <HI>is</HI> Cutchenele: <HI>the ber∣ries dye scarlet. Mr.</HI> George Sands <HI>in his Travels saith (much to the same purpose) that searlet dye growes like a blister on the leaf of the Holy</HI> Oake, <HI>a little shrub, yet producing</HI> Acorns, <HI>being gathered they rub out of it a certain red dust, that converteth after a while into worms, which they kill with Wine, when they begin to quicken. See farther concerning Treacle-berries and</HI> Cutchinele <HI>in the rarities of</HI> New-England.</P>
<P>The Pine-Tree challengeth the next place, and that sort which is called Board∣pine is the principal, it is a stately large Tree, very tall, and sometimes two or three fadom about: of the body the <HI>English</HI> make large <HI>Canows</HI> of 20 foot long, and two foot and a half over, hollowing of them with an Adds, and shaping of the outside like a Boat. Some conceive that the wood called <HI>Gopher</HI> in Scripture, of which <HI>Noah</HI> made the Ark, was no other than Pine, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.14. The bark thereof is good for Ulcers in ten∣der persons that refuse sharp medicines. The inner bark of young board-pine cut small and stampt and boiled in a Gallon of water is a very soveraign medicine for burn
<PB N="65" REF="37"/>or scald, washing the sore with some of the decoction, and then laying on the bark stampt very soft: or for frozen limbs, to take out the fire and to heal them, take the bark of Board-pine-Tree, cut it small and stamp it and boil it in a gallon of water to Gelly, wash the sore with the liquor, stamp the bark again till it be very soft and bind it on. The Turpentine is excellent to heal wounds and cuts, and hath all the proper∣ties of <HI>Venice</HI> Turpentine, the Rosen is as good as Frankincense, and the powder of the dryed leaves generateth flesh; the di∣stilled water of the green Cones taketh away wrinkles in the face being laid on with Cloths.</P>
<P>The Firr-tree is a large Tree too, but sel∣dom so big as the Pine, the bark is smooth, with knobs or blisters, in which lyeth clear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iquid Turpentine very good to be put into salves and oyntments, the leaves or Cones boiled in Beer are good for the Scurvie, the young buds are excellent to put into Epi∣themes for Warts and Corns, the Rosen is altogether as good as Frank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncense; out of this Tree the Poleakers draw Pitch and Tarr; the manner I shall give you, for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t may (with many other things contained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this Treatise) be beneficial to my Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rymen, either there already seated, or that
<PB N="66" REF="38"/>may happen to go thither hereafter. Out of the fattest wood changed into Torch∣wood, which is a disease in that Tree they draw Tarr, first a place must be paved with stone or the like, a little higher in the mid∣dle, about which there must be made gut∣ters, into which the liquor falls, then out from them other gutters are to be drawn, by which it may be received, then is it put into barrels. The place thus prepared, the cloven wood must be set upright, then must it be covered with a great number of sin and pitch bowes; and on every part all about with much lome and sods of earth, and great heed must be taken, lest there be any cleft or chink remaining, only a hole left in the top of the furnace, through which the fire may be put in, and the flame and smoak to pass out: when the fire burn∣eth, the Pitch or Tarr runneth forth first thin, and then thicker; of which when i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led is made Pitch: the powder o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dried Pitch is 'used to generate flesh in wounds and sores. The knots of this Tree and sat-pine are used by the <HI>English</HI> instead of Candles, and it will burn a long time but it makes the people pale.</P>
<P>The Spruce-tree I have given you an ac∣count of in my <HI>New-England</HI> ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ities. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h-east of <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the bank
<PB N="67" REF="38"/>of <HI>Lough-argick,</HI> there hath been formerly of these Trees 28 handful about at the Root, and their bodies mounted to 90 foot of height, bearing at the length 20 inches diameter. At <HI>Puscataway</HI> there is now a Spruce-tree brought down to the water∣side by our Mass-men of an incredible big∣ness, and so long that no Skipper durst ever yet adventure to ship it, but there it lyes and Rots.</P>
<P>The Hemlock-tree is a kind of spruce or pine; the bark boiled and stampt till it be very soft is excellent for to heal wounds, and so is the Turpentine thereof, and the Turpentine that issueth from the Cones of the Larch-tree, (which comes nearest of any to the right Turpentine) is singularly good to heal wounds, and to draw out the malice (or Thorn, as <HI>Helmont</HI> phrases is) of any Ach, rubbing the place therewith, and strowing upon it the powder of <HI>Sage</HI>-leaves.</P>
<P>The white Cedar is a stately Tree, and is taken by some to be <HI>Tamarisk,</HI> this Tree the <HI>English</HI> saw into boards to floor their Rooms, for which purpose it is excellent, long lasting, and wears very smooth and white; likewise they make shingles to cover their houses with instead of tyle, it will ne∣ver warp. This Tree, the Oak and the
<PB N="68" REF="39"/>Larch-tree are best for building. Groundsels made of Larch-tree will never rot, and the longer it lyes the harder it growes, that you may almost drive a nail into a bar of Iron as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asily as into that. Oh, that my Countrey∣men might obtain that blessing with their buildings, which <HI>Esay</HI> prophesied to the <HI>Jewes</HI> in the 65 Chapter and 22 verse. <HI>Non aedificabunt &amp; alius inhabitabit, non plantabunt &amp; alius comedet: sed ut sun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dies Arboris, dies erunt populi mei, &amp; opus manuum suarum deterent electi mei.</HI></P>
<P>The Sassafras-tree is no great Tree, I have met with some as big as my middle, the rind is tawny and upon that a thin co∣lour of Ashes, the inner part is white, of an excellent smell like Fennel, of a sweet tast with some bitterness; the leaves are like Fig-leaves of a dark green. A decocti∣on of the Roots and bark thereof sweetned with Sugar, and drunk in the morning fasting will open the body and procure a stool or two, it is good for the Scurvie taken some time together, and laying upon the legs the green leaves of white. <HI>Hellebore.</HI> They give it to Cows that have newly cal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to make them cast their Cleanings. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tree growes not beyond <HI>Black-point</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ward: it is observed, that there is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Trees and plants not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gions.</P>

<Q>Non omnis fert omnia tellus.</Q>
<P>The Walnut which is divers, some bea∣ring square nuts, others like ours, but smal∣ler: there is likewise black Walnut of pre∣cious use for Tables, Cabinets and the like. The Walnut-tree is the toughest wood in the Countrie, and therefore made use of for Hoops and Bowes, there being no Yew there growing; In <HI>England</HI> they made their Bowes usually of Witch, Hasel, Ash, Yew, the best of outlandish Elm, but the <HI>Indians</HI> make theirs of Walnut.</P>
<P>The Line-tree with long nuts, the other kind I could never find: the wood of this Tree, Laurel, Rhamnus, Holly and Ivy are accounted for woods that cause fire by at∣trition; Laurel and Ivy are not growing in <HI>New-England:</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> will rub two sear'd sticks of any sort of wood, and kindle a fire with them presently.</P>
<P>The Maple-tree, on the boughs of this Tree I have often found a jellied substance like <HI>Jewes-Ears,</HI> which I found upon tryal to be as good for fore throats <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Birch-tree is of two kinds, ordina∣ry Birch, and black Birch, many of these Trees are stript of their bark by the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> who make of it their Canows, Kettles,
<PB N="70" REF="40"/>and Birchen-dishes: there is an excrescence growing out of the body of the Tree called spunck, or dead mens Caps, it growes at the Roots of Ash, or Beech, or Elm; but the best is that which growes upon the black B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rch, this boiled and beaten, and then dri∣ed in an Oven maketh excellent Touch∣wood, and Balls to play with.</P>
<P>Alder, of which wood there is abundance in the wet swamps: the bark thereof with the yolke of an Egg is good for a strain; an <HI>Indian</HI> bruising of his knee, chew'd the bark of Alder fasting and laid it to, which quickly helped him. The wives of our West-Countrey English make a drink with the seeds of Alder, giving it to their Children troubled with the <HI>Alloes.</HI> I have talk'd with many of them, but could never apprehend what disease it should be they so name, these Trees are called by some Sul∣linges.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> tell of a Tree that growes for up in the land, that is as big as an Oake, that will cure the falling-sickness infallibly, what part thereof they use, Bark, Wood, leaves or fruit, I could never learn; they promised often to bring of it to me, but did not. I have seen a stately Tree grow∣ing here and there in valleys, not like to any Trees in Europe, having a smooth bark of
<PB N="71" REF="40"/>a dark brown colour, the leaves like great Maple, in <HI>England</HI> called Sycamor, but lar∣ger, it may be this is the Tree they brag of.</P>
<P>Thus much concerning Trees, now I shall present to your view the Shrubs; and first of the Sumach Shrub, which as I have told you in <HI>New-Englands</HI> rarities, differeth from all the kinds set down in our <HI>English</HI> Herbal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the root dyeth wool or cloth reddish, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he decoction of the leaves in wine drunk, is good for all Fluxes of the belly in man or woman, the whites, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For galled places stamp the leaves with honey, and apply it, nothing so soon healeth a wound in the head as Sumach stampt and applyed once in three dayes, the powder strewed in stayeth the bleeding of wounds: The seed of Su∣mach pounded and mixt with honey, hea∣leth the Hemorrhoids, the gum put into a hollow tooth asswageth the pain, the bark or berries in the fall of the leaf, is as good as galls to make Ink of.</P>
<P>Elder in <HI>New-England</HI> is shurubbie, &amp; dies once in two years: there is a sort of dwars-Elder that growes by the Sea-side that hath a red pith, the berries of both are smaller than <HI>English</HI>-Elder, not round but corner'd, neither of them small so strong as ours.</P>
<P>Juniper growes for the most part by the Sea-side, it bears abundance of skie-colou∣red
<PB N="72" REF="41"/>berries fed upon by Partridges, and hath a woodie root, which induceth me to believe that the plant mention'd in Job 30.4. <HI>Qui decerpebant herbas é salsilagine cum st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rpibus; etiam radices Juniperorum cibo erant iliis,</HI> was our <HI>Indian</HI> plant <HI>Cassava.</HI> They write that <HI>Juniper</HI>-coals preserve fire longest of any, keeping fire a whole year without supply, yet the <HI>Indian</HI> never burns of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>Sweet fern, see the rarities of <HI>New Eng∣land,</HI> the tops and nucaments of sweet forn boiled in water or milk and drunk helpeth all manner of Fluxes, being boiled in water it makes an excellent liquor for Inck.</P>
<P>Current-bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes are of two kinds red and black, the black cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents which are larger than the red smell like cats piss, yet are rea∣sonable pleasant in eating.</P>
<P>The Gooseberry-bush, the berry of which is called Grosers or thorn Grapes, grow all over the Countrie, the berry is but small, of a red or purple colour when ripe.</P>
<P>There is a small shrub which is very com∣mon, growing sometimes to the height of Elder, bearing a berry like in shape to the fruit of the white thorn, of a pale yellow colour at frist, then red, when it is ripe of a deep purple, of a delicate Aromatical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st, somewhat stiptick: to conclude, al∣wayes
<PB N="73" REF="41"/>observe this rule in taking or resu∣sing unknown fruit: it you find them eaten of the fowl or beast, you may boldly venture to eat of them, otherwise do not touch them.</P>
<P><HI>Maze,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Turkie</HI>-wheat, or rather <HI>Indian</HI>-wheat, because it came first from thence; the leaves boiled and drunk helpeth pain in the back; of the stalkes when they are green you may make <HI>Beve∣rage,</HI> as they do with <HI>Calamels,</HI> or Sagar∣canes. The raw Corn chewed ripens felons or Cats hairs, or you may lay Samp to it: The <HI>Indians</HI> before it be thorow ripe eat of it parched. Certainly the parched Corn that <HI>Abigail</HI> brought to <HI>David</HI> was of this kind of grain, 1 Sam. 25.18. <HI>The Jewes manner was (as it is delivered to us by a learned Divine) first to parch their Corn, then they fryed it, and lastly they bailed it to a paste, and then tempered it with water, Cheese-Curds, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncy and Eggs, this they carried drye with them to the Camp, and so wet the Cakes in Wine or milk; such was the pulse too of</HI> Africa.</P>
<P><HI>French</HI>-beans, or rather <HI>American</HI>-beans, the Heabalists call them kidney beans from their shape and effects, for they strengthen the kidneys; they are variegated much, some being bigger a great deal than others; some
<PB N="74" REF="42"/>white, black, red, yellow, blew, spotted; besides your <HI>Bonivis</HI> and <HI>Calavances</HI> and the kidney-bean, that is proper to <HI>Ronoake,</HI> but these are brought into the Countrie, the other are natural to the climate. So the <HI>Mexico</HI> pompion which is flat and deeply camphered, the flesh laid to, asswageth pain of the eyes. The water-mellon is pro∣per to the Countrie, the flesh of it is of a flesh colour, a rare cooler of Feavers, and excellent against the stone. <HI>Pomum spino∣sum</HI> and <HI>palma-Christi</HI> too growes not here, unless planted, brought from <HI>Peru;</HI> the la∣ter is thought to be the plant, that shaded Jonah <HI>the Prophet,</HI> Jonas 4.6. <HI>Paraverat enim</HI> Jehova <HI>Deus ricinum qui ascenderet supra</HI> Jonam, <HI>ut esset umbra super caput ejus erep∣tura eum à malo ipsius; laetabaturque</HI> Jonas <HI>de ricino illo laetitia magna.

<PB N="75" REF="42"/>brought into <HI>England,</HI> some will have Sir <HI>John Hawkins</HI> the first, others Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s Mariners; others again say that one Mr. <HI>Lane</HI> imployed by Sir <HI>Walter Raw∣leigh</HI> brought it first into <HI>England;</HI> all con∣clude that Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> brought it first in use. <HI>It is observed that no one kind of forraign Commodity yieldeth greater ad∣vantage to the publick than Tobacco, it is ge∣nerally made the complement of our entertain∣ment, and hath made more slaves than</HI> Maho∣met. There is three sorts of it Marchan∣table, the first horse Tobacco, having a br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad long leaf piked at the end; the se∣cond round pointed Tobacco; third sweet scented Tobacco. These are made up into Cane, leaf or ball; there is little of it planted in <HI>New-England,</HI> neither have they learned the right way of curing of it. It is sowen in <HI>April</HI> upon a bed of rich mould sifted, they make a bed about three yards long, or more according to the ground they intend to plant, and a yard and a half over; this they tread down hard, then they sow their seed upon it as thick as may be, and sift fine earth upon it, then tread it down again as hard as possible they can, when it hath gotten four or six leaves, they remove in into the planting ground; when it begins to bud towards flowring, they crop off the
<PB N="76" REF="43"/>top, for the Flower drawes away the strength of the leaf. For the rest I refer you to the Planter, being not willing to discover their mysteries. The <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New England</HI> use a small round leafed Tobacco, called by them, or the Fishermen Poke. <HI>It is odious to the</HI> English. <HI>The vertues of Tobacco are these, it helps digestion, the Gout, the Tooth-ach, prevents infection by scents, it heats the cold, and cools them that sweat, feedeth the hungry, spent spirits restoreth, purgeth the stomach, kil∣leth nits and lice, the juice of the green leaf healeth green wounds although poysoned, the Syrup for many diseases, the smoak for the Phthisick, cough of the lungs, distillations of Rheume, and all diserses of a cold and moist cause, good for all bodies cold and moist taken upon an emptie stomach, taken upon a full sto∣mach it precipitates digestion, immoderately taken it dryeth the body, enflameth the bloud, hurteth the brain, weakens the eyes and the sinews.</HI></P>
<P>White <HI>Hellebore</HI> is used for the Scurvie by the <HI>English.</HI> A friend of mine gave them first a purge, then conserve of Bear-berries, then sumed their leggs with vine∣gar, sprinkled upon a piece of mill-stone made hot, and applied to the sores white <HI>Hellebore</HI> leaves; drink made of <HI>Orpine</HI> and <HI>sorrel</HI> were given likewise with it, and Sea∣scurvie-grass.
<PB N="77" REF="43"/>To kill lice, boil the roots of <HI>Hellebore</HI> in milk, and anoint the hair of the head therewith or other places.</P>
<P><HI>Mandrake,</HI> is a very rare plant, the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> know it not, it is found in the woods about <HI>Pascataway,</HI> they do in plain terms stink, therefore <HI>Reubens</HI>-Flowers that he brought home were not <HI>Mandrakes,</HI> Gen. 30.14, 15, 16. <HI>They are rendered in the Latine</HI> Amabiles flores, <HI>the same word say our Di∣vines is used in</HI> Canticles, 7.4.

<P><HI>Avens,</HI> or herb-bennet; you have an account of it in <HI>New-Englands</HI> rarities; but one
<PB N="79" REF="44"/>thing more I shall add, that you may plain∣ly perceive a more masculine quality in the plants growing in <HI>New-England.</HI> A neigh∣bour of mine in Hay-time, having over∣heat himself, and melted his grease, with striving to outmowe another man, fell dan∣gerously sick, not being able to turn himself in his bed, his stomach gon, and his heart fainting ever and anon; to whom I admi∣nistred the decoction of <HI>Avens</HI>-Roots and leaves in water and wine, sweetning it with Syrup of Clove-Gilliflowers, in one weeks time it recovered him, so that he was able to perform his daily work, being a poor planter or husbandman as we call them.</P>
<P>Red-Lilly growes all over the Countrey amongst the bushes.

<P>I will finish this part of my relation con∣cerning plants, with an admirable plant for the curing and taking away of Corns, which many times sore troubleth the Tra∣veller: it is not above a handful high; the little branches are woodie, the leaves like
<PB N="82" REF="46"/>the leaves of Box, but broader and much thicker, hard, and of a deep grass-green colour; this bruised or champt in the mouth and laid upon the Corn will take it away clean in one night. And observe all <HI>Indian</HI> Trees and plants, their Roots are but of small depth, and so they must be set.</P>
<P>Of Beasts of the earth there be scarce 120 several kinds, and not much more of the Fowls of the Air, is the opinion of some Naturalists; there are not many kinds of Beasts in <HI>New-England,</HI> they may be divided into Beasts of the Chase of the stinking foot, as <HI>Roes, Foxes, Jaccals, Wolves, Wild-cats Racoons, Porcupines, Squncks, Mus∣quashes, Squirrels, Sables,</HI> and <HI>Mattrises;</HI> and Beasts of the Chase of the sweet foot, <HI>Buck,</HI> Red <HI>Dear,</HI> Rain-<HI>Dear, Elke, Marouse, Maccarib, Bear, Beaver, Otter, Marten, Hare.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Roe</HI> a kind of Deer, and the fleetest Beast upon earth is here to be found, and is good venison, but not over fat.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fox,</HI> the male is called a dog-fox, the female a bitch-fox, they go a clicketing the beginning of the spring, and bring forth their Cubs in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June.</HI> There are two or three kinds of them; one a great yellow <HI>Fox,</HI> another grey, who will climb up into Trees; the black <HI>Fox</HI> is of much esteem. <HI>Foxes</HI> and <HI>Wolves</HI> are usually hunted
<PB N="83" REF="46"/>in <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Holy-Rood</HI> day, till the <HI>Annunciation.</HI> In <HI>New-England</HI> they make best sport in the depth of winter: they lay a sledg-load of Cods-heads on the other side of a paled fence when the moon shines, and about nine or ten of the clock the <HI>Foxes</HI> come to it, sometimes two or three, or half a dozen, and more; these they shoot, and by that time they have cased them, there will be as many; So they continue shooting and killing of <HI>Foxes</HI> as long as the moon shineth: I have known half a score kill'd in one night. Their pisles are bonie like a doggs, their fat liquified and put into the ears easeth the pain, their tails or bushes are very fair ones and of good use, but their skins are so thin (yet thick set with deep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urr) that they will hardly hold the dres∣sing.</P>
<P><HI>Jaccals</HI> there be abundance, which is a Creature much like a <HI>Fox,</HI> but smaller, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re very frequent in <HI>Palaestina,</HI> or the <HI>Holy-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and.</HI></P>

<PB N="84" REF="47"/>they have a quicker way to destroy them. See <HI>New-England</HI> rarities. They commonly go in routs, a rout of <HI>Wolves</HI> is 12 or more, sometimes by couples. In 1664. we sound a <HI>Wolf</HI> asleep in a small dry swamp under an Oake, a great mastiff which we had with us seized upon him, and held him till we had put a rope about his neck, by which we brought him home, and tying of him to a stake we bated him with smaller Doggs, and had excellent sport; but his hinder legg being broken, they knockt out his brains. Sometime before this we had an excellent course after a single <HI>Wolf</HI> upon the hard sands by the Sea-side at low water for a mile or two, at last we lost our doggs, it be∣ing (as the <HI>Lancashire</HI> people phrase it) twi-l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght, that is almost dark, and went be∣yond them, for a mastiff-bitch had seized upon the <HI>Wolf</HI> being gotten into the Sea, and there held him till one went in and led him out, the bitch keeping her hold till they had tyed his leggs, and so carried him home like a Calf upon a staff between two men; being brought into the house they unbound him and set him upon his leggs, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not offering in the least to bite, or so much as to shew his teeth, but clapping his stern betwixt his leggs, and leering towards the door would willingly have had his liber∣ty,
<PB N="85" REF="47"/>but they served him as they did the other, knockt his brains out, for our doggs were not then in a condition to bate him; their eyes shine by night as a Lanthorn: the Fangs of a <HI>Wolf</HI> hung about childrens necks keep them from frighting, and are very good to rub their gums with when they are breeding of Teeth, the gall of a <HI>Wolf</HI> is Soveraign for swelling of the sinews; the fiants or dung of a <HI>Wolf</HI> drunk with white-wine helpeth the <HI>Collick.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Wild-cat, Lusern</HI> or <HI>luceret,</HI> or Ounce as some call it, is not inferiour to Lamb, their grease is very soveraign for lameness upon taking cold.</P>
<P>The <HI>Racoon</HI> or <HI>Rattoon</HI> is of two sorts, gray <HI>Rattoons,</HI> and black <HI>Rattoons,</HI> their grease is soveraign for wounds with bruises, aches, streins, bruises; and to anoint after broken bones and dislocations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Squnck</HI> is almost as big as a <HI>Racoon,</HI> perfect black and white or pye-bald, with a bush-tail like a <HI>Fox,</HI> and offensive Carion; the Urine of this Creature is of so strong a scent, that if it light upon any thing, there is no abiding of it, it will make a man smell, though he were of <HI>Alexanders</HI> complexion; and so sharp that if he do but whisk his bush which he pisseth upon in the face of a dogg hunting of him, and that
<PB N="86" REF="48"/>any of it light in his eyes it will make him almost mad with the smart thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>Musquashes</HI> is a small Beast that lives in shallow ponds, where they build them houses of earth and sticks in shape like mole∣hills, and feed upon <HI>Calamus Aromaticus:</HI> in <HI>May</HI> they scent very strong of Muske; their furr is of no great esteem; their stones wrapt up in Cotten-wool will continue a long time, and are good to lay amongst cloths to give them a grateful smell.</P>
<P>The <HI>Squirril,</HI> of which there are three sorts, the mouse-squirril, the gray squirril, and the flying squirril, called by the <HI>Indian Assapanick.</HI> The mouse-squirril is hardly so big as a Rat, streak'd on both sides with bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck and red streaks, they are mischievous vermine destroying abundance of Corn both in the field and in the house, where they will gnaw holes into Chests, and tear clothes both linnen and wollen, and are no∣table nut-g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>therers in <HI>August;</HI> when hasel and ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ert nuts are ripe you may see upon every Nut-tree as many mouse-squirrils as leaves; So that the: u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are gone in a trice, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich they convey to their Drays or Nests. The gray squirril is pretty large, almost as big as a Conie, and are very good meat: in some parts of the Countrie there are many of them. The flying squirril is so called, be∣cause
<PB N="87" REF="48"/>(his skin being loose and large) he spreads it on both sides like wings when he passeth from one Tree to another at great distance. I cannot call it flying nor leaping, for it is both.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mattrise</HI> is a Creature whose head and fore-parts is shaped somewhat like a Lyons, not altogether so big as a house-cat, they are innumerable up in the Countrey, and are esteemed good furr.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sable</HI> is much of the size of a <HI>Mat∣trise</HI> perfect black, but what store there is of them I cannot tell, I never saw but two of them in Eight years space.</P>
<P>The <HI>Martin</HI> is as ours are in <HI>England,</HI> but blacker, they breed in holes which they make in the earth like Conies, and are in∣numerable, their skins or furr are in much request.</P>
<P>The <HI>Buck, Stag,</HI> and <HI>Rain-Dear</HI> are Creatures that will live in the coldest cli∣mates, here they are innumerable, bringing forth three <HI>Fawns</HI> or <HI>Calves</HI> at a time, which they hide a mile asunder to prevent their destruction by the <HI>Wolves,</HI> wild-<HI>Cats, Bears,</HI> and <HI>Mequans:</HI> when they are in season they will be very fat; there are but few slain by the <HI>English.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> who shoot them, and take of them with toyls, bring them in
<PB N="88" REF="49"/>with their suet, and the bones that grow upon <HI>Stags-Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>What would you say, if I should tell you that in <HI>Green-land</HI> there are <HI>Does</HI> that have as large horns as <HI>Bucks,</HI> their brow Antlers growing downwards beyond their <HI>Musles,</HI> and broad at the end wherewith they scrape away the snow to the grass, it being im∣possible for them otherwayes to live in those cold Countries; the head of one of these <HI>Does</HI> was sometime since nailed upon a sign∣posi in <HI>Charter house-lane,</HI> and these follow∣ing verses written upon a board underneath it.</P>
<Q><L>Like a <HI>Bucks</HI>-head I stand in open view,</L>
<L>And yet am none; nay, wonder not, 'tis true;</L>
<L>The living Beast that these fair horns did owe</L>
<L>Well known to many, was a <HI>Green-land Doe.</HI></L>
<L>The proverb old is here fulfill'd in me,</L>
<L>That every like is not the same you see.</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Moose</HI> or <HI>Elke</HI> is a Creature, or ra∣ther if you will a Monster of superfluity; a full grown <HI>Moose</HI> is many times bigger than an <HI>English</HI> Oxe, their horns as I have said elsewhere, very big (and brancht out into palms) the tips whereof are sometimes found to be two fathom asunder, (a fathom
<PB N="89" REF="49"/>is six feet from the tip of one finger to the tip of the other, that is four cubits,) and in height from the toe of the fore-foot, to the pitch of the shoulder twelve foot, both which hath been taken by some of my <HI>scep∣tique</HI> Readers to be monstrous lyes. If you consider the breadth that the beast car∣rieth, and the magnitude of the horns, you will be easily induced to contribute your be∣lief. And for their height since I came into <HI>England</HI> I have read Dr. <HI>Scroderns</HI> his Chy∣mical dispensatory translated into <HI>English</HI> by Dr. <HI>Rowland,</HI> where he writes <HI>that when he lived in</HI> Finland <HI>under</HI> Gustavus Horns, <HI>he saw an</HI> Elke <HI>that was killed and presented to</HI> Gustavus <HI>his Mother, seventeen spans high.</HI> Lo you now Sirs of the Gibing crue, if you have any skill in mensuration, tell me what difference there is between Seventeen spans and twelve foot. There are certain transcendentia in every Creature, which are the indelible Characters of God, and which discover God; There's a prudential for you, as <HI>John Rhodes</HI> the Fisherman used to say to his mate, <HI>Kitt Lux.</HI> But to go on with the <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se;</HI> they are accounted a kind of Deer, and have three <HI>Calves</HI> at a time, which they hide a mile asunder too, as other Deer do, their skins make excellent Coats for Martial men, their sinews which are as
<PB N="90" REF="50"/>big as a mans finger are of perdurable toughness and much used by the <HI>Indians,</HI> the bone that growes upon their heart is an excellent Cordial, their bloud is as thick as an <HI>Asses</HI> or <HI>Bulls</HI> who have the thickest bloud of all others, a man the thinnest. To what age they live I know not, certainly a long time in their proper climate. <HI>Some particular living Creatures cannot live in eve∣ry particular place or region, especially with the same j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and felicity as it did where it was first br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, for the certain agreement of nature that is between the place and the thing bred in that place: As appeareth by</HI> Elephants, <HI>which being translated and brought out of the Second or Third Climate, though they may live, yet will they never ingender or bring forth young.</HI> So for plants, Birds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of both these Creatures, some few there have been brought into <HI>England,</HI> but did not long continue. Sir <HI>R. Baker</HI> in his Chronicle tells us of an <HI>Elephant</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> the Thirds R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign, which he saith was the first that was ever seen there, which as it seems is an error, unless he restrain it to the <HI>Norman</HI>'s time. For Mr. <HI>Speed</HI> writeth that <HI>Claudius Drusius</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome</HI> brought in the first in his Army; the bones of which digg'd up since are taken for Gyants bones. As for the <HI>Moose</HI> the first that was seen in <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="50"/>was in King <HI>Charles</HI> the First Raign; thus much for these magnals amongst the Crea∣tures of God to be wondered at, the next beast to be mentioned is</P>
<P>The <HI>Maurouse,</HI> which is somewhat like a <HI>Moose,</HI> but his horns are but small, and himself about the size of a <HI>Stag,</HI> these are the Deer that the flat-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooted <HI>Wolves</HI> hunt after.</P>
<P>The <HI>Maccarib</HI> is a Creature not found that ever I heard yet, but upon <HI>Cape-Sable</HI> near to the <HI>French</HI> plantations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bear</HI> when he goes to mate is a ter∣rible Creature, they bring forth their Cubs in <HI>March,</HI> hunted with doggs they take a Tree where they shoot them, when he is fat he is excellent Venison, which is in <HI>Acorn</HI> time, and in winter, but then there is none dares to attempt to kill him but the <HI>Indian.</HI> He makes his Denn amongst thick Bushes, thrusting in here and there store of <HI>Moss,</HI> which being covered with snow and melting in the day time with heat of the Sun, in the night is frozen into a thick coat of Ice; the mouth of his Den is very narrow, here they lye single, never two in a Den all winter. The <HI>Indian</HI> as soon as he finds them, creeps in upon all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our, seiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with his left hand upon the neck of the sleeping <HI>Bear,</HI> drags h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to the mouth of
<PB N="92" REF="51"/>the Den, where with a club or small hatchet in his right hand he knocks out his brains before he can open his eyes to see his ene∣my. But sometimes they are too quick for the <HI>Indians,</HI> as one amongst them call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d black <HI>Robin</HI> lighting upon a male <HI>Bear</HI> had a piece of his buttock torn off before he could fetch his blow: their grease is very soveraign. One Mr. <HI>Purchase</HI> cured him∣self of the <HI>Sciatica</HI> with <HI>Bears</HI>-greese, keep∣ing some of it continually in his groine. It is good too for swell'd Cheeks upon cold, for Rupture of the hands in winter, for limbs taken suddenly with <HI>Sciatica, Gout,</HI> or o∣ther diseases that cannot stand upright nor go, bed-rid; it must be well chaft in, and the same cloth laid on still; it prevents the shedding of the hair occasioned by the cold∣ness of winters weather; and the yard of a <HI>Bear</HI> which as a Doggs or Foxes is bonie, is good for to expell Gravel out of the kid∣neys and bladder, as I was there told by one Mr. <HI>Abraham Philater</HI> a <HI>Jersey-man.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Beaver</HI> or Pound-dog is an Amphi∣bious Creature, lives upon the land as well as in the water. I suppose they feed upon fish, but am sure that the Bark of Trees is also their food; there is an old proverbial saying, <HI>sic me jubes quotidie, ut fiber s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licem:</HI> you love me as the <HI>Beaver</HI> doth the willow;
<PB N="93" REF="51"/>who eateth the Bark and killeth the Tree. They will be tame, witness the <HI>Beaver</HI> that not long since was kept at <HI>Boston</HI> in the <HI>Massachusets-Bay,</HI> and would run up and down the streets, returning home without a call. Their skins are highly valued, and their stones are good for the palsie, trembling, and numbness of the hands, boiling of them in Oyl of <HI>Spike,</HI> and anointing the sinews in the neck. If you take of <HI>Castori∣um</HI> two drams, of womans hair one dram, and with a little Rozen of the <HI>Pine</HI>-Tree, make it up into pills as big as Filberts and perfume a woman in a fit of the mother with one at a time laid upon coals under her nostrils, it will recover her out of her fit. The grease of a <HI>Beaver</HI> is good for the Nerves, Convulsions, Epilepsies, Apo∣plexies <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The tail as I have said in ano∣ther Treatise, is very fat and of a mascu∣line vertue, as good as <HI>Erigno's</HI> or <HI>Satyrion</HI>-Roots.</P>
<P>The <HI>Otter</HI> or River-<HI>Dog</HI> is Amphibious too, he hunteth for his kind in the spring, and bringeth forth his whelps as the <HI>Beaver</HI> doth, they are generally black, and very nu∣merous, they are hunted in <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Shrovetide</HI> untill <HI>Midsummer,</HI> but in <HI>New-England</HI> they take them when they can. The skin of an <HI>Otter</HI> is worth Ten Shillings,
<PB N="94" REF="52"/>and the Gloves made thereof are the best fortification for the hands against wet wea∣ther that can be thought of, the furr is ex∣cellent for muffs, and is almost as dear as <HI>Beaver,</HI> the grease of an <HI>Otter</HI> will make fish turn up their bellies, and is of rare use for many things.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hare,</HI> I have no more to write of them than that they kindle in hollow Trees. What else concerns him, or any of the fore-mentioned Creatures you have in my <HI>New-Englands</HI> rarities, to which I refer you.</P>
<P>The <HI>Porcupine</HI> likewise I have treated of, only this I forgot to acquaint you with, that they lay Eggs, and are good meat.</P>
<P>The last kind of Beasts are they that are begot by equivocal generation, as <HI>Mules</HI> and several others, that when the Beasts were brought by the Almighty Creator to <HI>Adam,</HI> who gave them names, were not then in <HI>rerum natura.</HI> Of these there are not many known in <HI>New-England.</HI> I know but of one, and that is the <HI>Indian</HI> dog begotten betwixt a <HI>Wolf</HI> and a <HI>Fox,</HI> or between a <HI>Fox</HI> and a <HI>Wolf,</HI> which they made use of, taming of them, and bringing of them up to hunt with, but since the <HI>English</HI> came a∣mongst them they have gotten store of our dogs, which they bring up and keep in as much subjection as they do their webbs.</P>
<PB N="95" REF="52"/>
<P>Of Birds there are not many more than 120 kinds as our Naturalists have conjectu∣red, but I think they are deceived; they are divided into land-birds and water-birds, the land-birds again into birds of prey, birds for meat, singing-birds and others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pilhannaw</HI> is the King of Birds of prey in <HI>New-England,</HI> some take him to be a kind of <HI>Eagle,</HI> others for the <HI>Indian-Ruck</HI> the biggest Bird that is, except the <HI>Ostrich.</HI> One Mr. <HI>Hilton</HI> living at <HI>Pascata∣way,</HI> had the hap to kill one of them: being by the Sea-side he perceived a great sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dow over his head, the Sun shining out clear, casting up his eyes he saw a monstrous Bird soaring aloft in the air, and of a sudden all the <HI>Ducks</HI> and <HI>Geese,</HI> (there being then a great many) dived under water, nothing of them appearing but their heads. Mr. <HI>Hilton</HI> having made readie his piece, shot and brought her down to the ground, how he disposed of her I know not, but had he taken her alive &amp; sent her over into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> neither <HI>Bartholomew</HI> nor <HI>Sturbridge</HI>-Fair could have produced such another sight.</P>
<P><HI>Hawkes</HI> there are of several kinds, as <HI>Goshawkes, Falcons, Laniers, Sparrow-hawkes,</HI> and a little black <HI>hawke</HI> highly pri∣zed by the <HI>Indians</HI> who wear them on their
<PB N="96" REF="53"/>heads, and is accounted of worth sufficient to ransome a <HI>Sagamour:</HI> they are so strange∣ly couragious and hardie, that nothing flyeth in the Air that they will not bind with.

<P>The <HI>Osprey</HI> I have treated of. There is a small Ash-colour Bird that is shaped like a <HI>Hawke</HI> with talons and beak that falleth upon <HI>Crowes,</HI> mounting up into the Air af∣ter them, and will beat them till they make them cry.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vulture</HI> or <HI>Geire,</HI> which is spoken of in <HI>Levit.</HI> 11.14. and called a <HI>Gripe,</HI> their skins are good to line doublets with, and the bones of their head hung about the neck helpeth the head-ach.</P>

<P>The <HI>Owl</HI> the most flagging Bird that is, of which there are three sorts, a great grey <HI>Owl</HI> with ears, a little grey <HI>Owl,</HI> and a white <HI>Owl,</HI> which is no bigger than a <HI>Thrush. Plinie</HI> writes that the brains of an <HI>Owl</HI> as∣swageth the pain &amp; inflammation in the lap of the ear.

But now peradventure some will say, what doth this man mean to bring <HI>Owls</HI> to <HI>Athens?</HI> verily Sirs I presume to say, had I brought over of the little white <HI>Owls</HI> they would have been acceptable, they are good mousers, and pretty Birds to look upon: the <HI>Athenians,</HI> no question are bet∣ter imployed than to take notice of my <HI>Owls,</HI> poor ragged Birds they are and want those glistering golden feathers that <HI>Drai∣ton</HI>'s <HI>Owl</HI> is adorned with, yet they are somewhat of that nature; if an <HI>Athenian</HI> chance in this season of divertisement to cast an eye upon them I shall be glad, but more glad if he vouchsafe to prune and correct their feathers, which I confess are discomposed for want of Art; plain Birds they are, and fit for none but plain men to manage. Sirs do not mistake me, there's no man living honours an <HI>Athenian</HI> more than I do, especially where I perceive great abilities concomiting with goodness of na∣ture: A good nature (saith Mr. <HI>Perkins</HI>) is the Character of God, and God is the father of learning, knowledge, and every good gift, and hath condescended to be∣come a School-master to us poor mortals, furnishing of us with Philosophy, Historie, Divinity by his holy Scriptures, which if we diligently learn and practise, we shall in
<PB N="98" REF="54"/>time be brought into his Heavenly Acade∣my, where we shall have fulness and perfe∣ction of knowledge eternally. But there are a Generation of men and women in this prophane age that despise Gods learning and his Ushers to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> choosing to wallow in the pleasures of sin for a sea∣son. I shall conclude this excursion, with that which a Poet writ sometime since, and then return to the trimming of my <HI>Owl.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Sturgeon</HI> is a Regal fish too, I have seen of them that have been sixteen foot in length: of their sounds they make <HI>Isirglass,</HI> which melted in the mouth is excellent to seal letters.</P>

<P>The <HI>Sea-horse</HI> or <HI>Morse</HI> is a kind of monster-fish numerous about the Isle of <HI>Sables.</HI> i. e. The sandy Isle.

<P>The <HI>Muscle</HI> is of two sorts, Sea-<HI>muscles</HI> in which they find Pearl and river-<HI>muscles.</HI> Sea-<HI>muscles</HI> dryed and pulverized and laid upon the sores of the <HI>Piles</HI> and <HI>hemorrhoids</HI> with oyl will perfectly cure them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whore</HI> is a shell-fish, the shells are called whores-eggs, being fine round white shells, in shape like a <HI>Mexico</HI> pompion, but no bigger than a good large Hens-egg; they are wrought down the sides with little knobs and holes very prettily, but are but thin and brittle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Perriwig</HI> is a shell-fish that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>h in the Sands flat and round as a shovel-board piece and very little thicker; these at a lit∣tle hole in the middle of the shell thrust out a cap of hair, but upon the least motion of any danger it drawes it in again.</P>

<P>The <HI>Eal</HI> is of two sorts, salt-water <HI>Eals</HI> and fresh-water <HI>Eals;</HI> these again are distin∣guished into yellow bellied <HI>Eals</HI> and silver bellied <HI>Eals;</HI> I never eat better <HI>Eals</HI> in no part of the world that I have been in, than are here.

There is several wayes of cooking them, some love them roasted, others baked, and many will have them fryed; but they please my palate best when they are boiled, a com∣mon way it is to boil them in half water, half wine with the bottom of a manchet, a fagot of Parsley, and a little winter savo∣ry, when they are boiled they take them out and break the bread in the broth, and put to it three or four spoonfuls of yest, and a piece of sweet butter, this they pour to their <HI>Eals</HI> laid upon sippets and so serve it up. I fancie my way better which is this, after the <HI>Eals</HI> are fley'd and washt I fill their bellies with Nutmeg grated and Cloves a little bruised, and sow them up with a needle and thred, then I stick a Clove here and there in their sides about an inch asunder,
<PB N="112" REF="61"/>making holes for them with a bodkin, this done I wind them up in a wreath and put them into a kettle with half water and half white wine-vinegar, so much as will rise four fingers above the <HI>Eals;</HI> in midst of the <HI>Eals</HI> I put the bottom of a penny white loaf, and a fagot of these herbs following, Parsley one handful, a little sweet Marjoram, Peniroyal and Savory, a branch of Rose∣mary, bind them up with a thred, and when they are boiled enough take out the <HI>Eals</HI> and pull out the threds that their bellies were sowed up with, turn out the Nutmeg and Cloves, put the <HI>Eals</HI> in a dish with butter and vinegar upon a chafing-dish with coals to keep warm, then put into the broth three or four spoonfuls of good Ale-yeast with the juice of half a Lemmon; but be∣fore you put in your yeast beat it in a porrin∣ger with some of the broth, then break the crust of bread very small and mingle it well together with the broth, pour it into a deep dish and garnish it with the other half of the Lemmon, and so serve them up to the Table in two dishes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Frost fish</HI> is little bigger than a <HI>Gud∣geon</HI> and are taken in fresh brooks; when the waters are frozen they make a hole in the Ice about half a yard or yard wide, to which the fish repair in great numbers, where with
<PB N="113" REF="61" MS="y"/>small nets bound to a hoop about the big∣ness of a fiskin-hoop with a staff fastned to it they lade them out of the hole. I have not done with the fish yet, being willing to let you know all of them that are to be seen and catch'd in the Sea and fresh waters in <HI>New-England,</HI> and because I will not tire your patience overmuch, having no occasi∣on to enlarge my discourse, I shall only name them and so conclude.</P>

<P>The fish are swum by, and the Serpents are creeping on, terrible creatures, carrying stings in their tails. It will smart worse than a <HI>Satyrs</HI> whip, though it were as big as Mr. <HI>Shepperds</HI> the mad Gentleman at <HI>Milton-Mowhrayes Constantinus Lasculus.</HI></P>
<P>The chief or Captain of these is the Rattle-snake described already in my Jour∣nal, in some places of the Countrey there are none as at <HI>Plimouth, New-town, Nahant</HI> and some other places, they will live on one side of the River, and but swimming over and coming into the woods dye immedi∣ately.</P>
<P>The fat of a Rattle-snake is very Sove∣raign for frozen limbs, bruises, lameness by falls, Aches, Sprains. The heart of a Rattle-snake dried and pulverized and drunk with wine or beer is an approved remedy against the biting and venome of a Rattle-snake. Some body will give me thanks for disco∣vering
<PB N="115" REF="62"/>these secrets and the rest; <HI>Non omni∣bus omnia conveniunt.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Snake</HI> of which there are infinite numbers of various colours, some black, others painted with red, yellow and white, some again of a grass-green colour powde∣red all over as it were with silver dust or <HI>Muscovie</HI>-glass. But there is one sort that exceeds all the rest, and that is the Check-quered snake, having as many colours with∣in the checkquers shaddowing one another, as there are in a Rainbow. There are two sorts of snakes, the land-snake and the wa∣ter-snake; the water-snake will be as big about the belly as the Calf of a mans leg; I never heard of any mischief that snakes did, they kill them sometimes for their skins and bones to make hatbands off, their skins likewise worn as a Garter is an excel∣lent remedie against the cramp. I have found of the skins that they cast in woods in some quantity, they cast not their very skins, but only the superfluous thin skin that is upon the very skin, for the very skin is basted to the flesh, so Lobsters and Crabs.</P>
<P>The Earth-worm, these are very rare and as small as a horse hair, but there is a Bug that lyes in the earth and eateth the seed, that is somewhat like a Maggot of a white colour with a red head, and is about
<PB N="116" REF="63"/>the bigness of ones finger and an inch or an inch and half long. There is also a dark dunnish Worm or Bug of the bigness of an Oaten-straw, and an inch long, that in the spring lye at the Root of Corn and Garden plants all day, and in the night creep out and devour them; these in some years de∣stroy abundance of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn and Garden plants, and they have but one way to be rid of them, which the <HI>English</HI> have learnt of the <HI>Indians;</HI> And because it is somewhat strange, I shall tell you how it is, they go out into a field or garden with a Birchen∣dish, and spudling the earth about the roots, for they lye not deep, they gather their dish full which may contain about a quart or three pints, then they carrie the dish to the Sea-side when it is ebbing-water and set it a swimming, the water carrieth the dish into the Sea and within a day or two if you go into your field you may look your eyes out sooner than find any of them.</P>
<P><HI>Sow-bugs</HI> or <HI>Millipedes</HI> there be good store, but none of that sort that are blew and turn round as a pea when they are touched; neither are there any <HI>Beetles</HI> nor <HI>Maple-bugs,</HI> but a stinking black and red <HI>Bug</HI> called a <HI>Cacarooch</HI> or <HI>Cockroach,</HI> and a little black <HI>Bug</HI> like a <HI>Lady-cow</HI> that breeds in skins and furrs and will eat them to their
<PB N="117" REF="63"/>utter spoil. Likewise there be infinite num∣bers of <HI>Tikes</HI> hanging upon the bushes in summer time that will cleave to a mans garments and creep into his Breeches eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockins of those that have gone through the woods cove∣red with them. Besides these there is a <HI>Bug,</HI> but whether it be a Native to the Countrie or a stranger I cannot say: Some are of opinion that they are brought in by the Merchant with Spanish goods, they in∣fest our beds most, all day they hide them∣selves, but when night comes they will creep to the sleeping wretch and bite him worse than a flea, which raiseth a swelling knub that will itch intolerably, if you scratch it waxeth bigger and growes to a scab; and if you chance to break one of the <HI>Bugs</HI> it will stink odiously: they call them <HI>Chinches</HI> or <HI>Wood-lice,</HI> they are fat, red and in shape like a <HI>Tike</HI> and no bigger. There are also Palmer-worms which is a kind of Catterpiller, these some years will devour the leaves of Trees leaving them as naked almost as in winter, they do much harm in the <HI>English</HI> Orchards. Of <HI>Snails</HI> there are but few, and those very little ones, they lye at the Roots of long grass in moist places, and are no where else to be found.
<PB N="118" REF="64"/>Spiders and Spinners there be many, the last very big and of several colours.</P>
<P>The Pismire or Ant must not be forgot∣ten, accounted the least Creature, and by <HI>Salomon</HI> commended for its wisdom, Prov. 30.24.25 <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atuor ista parva sunt humilia, tamen sunt sap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entia, apprime sapientia: for∣mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a populus infirmus, quae comparant eastate cibumsuum,</HI> &amp;c. There are two sorts, red Ants and black Ants, both of them are ma∣ny times sound winged; not long since they were poured upon the Sands out of the clouds in a storm betwixt <HI>Black-point</HI> and <HI>Saco,</HI> where the passenger might have walkt up to the Ankles in them.</P>
<P>The Grashopper is innum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rable and big∣ger by much than ours in <HI>England,</HI> having Tinsel-wings, with help whereof they will flye and skip a great way. Next to these in number are your Crickets, a man can walk no where in the summer but he shall tread upon them, The <HI>Italian</HI> who hath them cryed up and down the streets <HI>(Grille che cantelo)</HI> and buyeth them to put into his Gardens, if he were in <HI>New-England</HI> would gladly be rid of them, they make such a dinn in an Evening. I could never discover the Organ of their voice, they have a little clift in their Crown which opens, and at the same instant they shake their wings.</P>
<PB N="119" REF="64"/>
<P>The Est or Swift in <HI>New-England</HI> is a most beautiful Creature to look upon, be∣ing larger than ours, and painted with glo∣rious colours; but I lik'd him never the better for it.</P>
<P>Frogs too there are in ponds and upon dry land, they chirp like Birds in the spring, and latter end of summer croak like Toads. It is admirable to consider the generating of these Creatures, first they lay their gelly on the water in ponds and still waters, which comes in time to be full of black spots as broad as the head of a Ten∣penny nail, and round, these separate them∣selves from the gleir, and after a while thrust out a tail, then their head comes forth, after their head springs out their fore-legs, and then their hinder-legs, then their tail drops off, and growes to have a head and four legs too, the first proves a frog, the lat∣ter a water-nuet. The Herbalist useth to say by way of admiration, <HI>quaelibet herba de∣um &amp;c.</HI> So God is seen in the production of these small Creatures which are a part of the Creation; <HI>Laudate Jehovam coelites, laudate eum in excelsis,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Laudent nomen Jehovae quae ipso praecipiente illico creata sunt</HI> &amp;c. <HI>ipsae bestiae &amp; omnes jumenta, reptilia &amp; aves alatae,</HI> Psal. 148.</P>
<P>The Toad is of two sorts, one that is
<PB N="120" REF="65"/>speckled with white, and another of a a dark earthy colour; there is of them that will climb up into Trees and sit croaking there; but whether it be of a third sort, or one of the other, or both, I am not able to affirm; but this I can testifie that there be Toads of the dark coloured kind that are as big as a groat loaf. Which report will not swell into the belief of my sceptique Sirs; nor that there is a Hell, being like <HI>Salomon</HI>'s fool, Prov. 26.22. <HI>Sed si contun∣deres stultum in mortario cum mola pistillo, non recederet ab eo stultitia ejus.</HI></P>
<P>Now before I proceed any further, I must (to prevent misconstructions) tell you that these following Creatures, though they be not properly accounted Serpents, yet they are venomous and pestilent Crea∣tures. As, first the Rat, but he hath been brought in since the <HI>English</HI> came thither, but the Mouse is a Native, of which there are several kinds not material to be descri∣bed; the Bat or flitter mouse is bigger a∣bundance than any in <HI>England</HI> and swarm, which brings me to the infects or cut-wasted creatures again, as first the honey-Bee, which are carried over by the <HI>English</HI> and thrive there exceedingly, in time they may be produced from Bullocks when the wild Beasts are destroyed. But the wasp is com∣mon,
<PB N="121" REF="65"/>and they have a sort of wild humble-Bee that breed in little holes in the earth. Near upon twenty years since there lived an old planter at <HI>Black-point,</HI> who on a Sunshine day about one of the clock lying upon a green bank not far from his house, charged his Son, a lad of 12 years of age to a∣waken him when he had slept two hours, the old man falls asleep and lying upon his back gaped with his mouth wide enough for a Hawke to shit into it; after a little while the lad sitting by spied a humble-Bee creeping out of his Fathers mouth, which taking wing flew quite out of sight, the hour as the lad ghest being come to awaken his Father he jogg'd him and cal∣led aloud Father, Father, it is two a clock, but all would not rouse him, at last he sees the humble-Bee returning, who lighted up∣on the sleepers lip and walked down as the lad conceived into his belly, and presently he awaked.</P>
<P>The Countrey is strangely incommoda∣ted with flyes, which the <HI>English</HI> call Musketaes, they are like our gnats, they will sting so fiercely in summer as to make the faces of the <HI>English</HI> swell'd and scab∣by, as if the small pox for the first year. Likewise there is a small black fly no bigger than a flea, so numerous up in the Countrey,
<PB N="122" REF="66"/>that a man cannot draw his breath, but he will suck of them in: they continue about Thirty dayes say some, but I say three moneths, and are not only a pester∣ment but a plague to the Countrey. There is another sort of fly called a Gurnipper that are like our horse-slyes, and will bite desperately, making the bloud to spurt out in great quantity; these trouble our <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Cattle very much, raising swellings as big as an egg in their hides. The Butterfly is of several sorts and larger than ours; So are their Dragon-flyes. Glow-worms have here wings, there are multitudes of them insomuch that in the dark evening when I first went into the Countrey I thought the whole Heavens had been on fire, seeing so many sparkles flying in the air: about <HI>Mount-Carmel,</HI> and the valley of <HI>Acree</HI> in the <HI>Holy-land</HI> there be abundance of them.</P>
<P>These are taken for <HI>Cantharides. Cantha∣rides</HI> are green flyes by day, in the night they pass about like a flying Glow-worm with fire in their tails.</P>
<P>I have finished now my relation of plants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have taken some pains in re∣collecting of them to memory, and setting of them down for their benefit from whom I may expect thanks; but I believe my re∣ward
<PB N="123" REF="66"/>will be according to <HI>Ben Johnsons</HI> proverbs, Whistle to a J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de and he will pay you with a fart, Claw a churl by the britch and he will shit in your fist.</P>
<P>The people that inhabited this Countrey are judged to be of the <HI>Tartars</HI> called <HI>Sa∣monids</HI> that border upon <HI>Mascovia,</HI> and are divided into Tribes; those to the East and North-east are called <HI>Churchers</HI> and <HI>Taren∣tines,</HI> and <HI>Monhegans.</HI> To the South are the <HI>Pequets</HI> and <HI>Narragansets.</HI> Westward <HI>Con∣necticuts</HI> and <HI>Mowhacks.</HI> To the North ward <HI>Aberginians</HI> which confist of <HI>Mattachusets, Wippanaps</HI> and <HI>Tarrentines.</HI> The <HI>Pocanakets</HI> live to the Westward of <HI>Plimouth.</HI> Not long before the <HI>English</HI> came into the Countrey, happened a great mortality amongst them, especially where the <HI>English</HI> afterwards planted, the East and Northern parts were sore smitten with the Contagion; first by the plague, afterwards when the <HI>English</HI> came by the small pox, the three Kingdoms or <HI>Sagamorships</HI> of the <HI>Mattachusets</HI> were very populous, having under them seven Dukedoms or petti-<HI>Sagamorships,</HI> but by the plague were brought from 30000 to 300. There are not many now to the East∣ward, the <HI>Pequots</HI> were destroyed by the <HI>English:</HI> the <HI>Mowhacks</HI> are about five hun∣dred: Their speech a dialect of the <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="67"/>(as also is the <HI>Turkish</HI> tongue) There is difference between Tongues and Languages, the division of speech at <HI>Babel</HI> is most pro∣perly called Languages, the rest Tongues.</P>
<P>As for their persons they are tall and handsome timber'd people, out-wristed, pale and lean <HI>Tartarian</HI> visag'd, black eyed which is accounted the strongest for sight, and generally black hair'd, both smooth and curi'd wearing of it long. No beards, or very rarely, their Teeth are very white, short and even, they account them the most necessary and best parts of man; And as the <HI>Austreans</HI> are known by their great lips, the <HI>Bavarians</HI> by their pokes un∣der their chins, the <HI>Jews</HI> by their goggle eyes, so the <HI>Indians</HI> by their flat noses, yet are they not so much deprest as they are to The Southward.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indesses</HI> that are young, are some of them very comely, having good features, their faces plump and round, and generally plump of their Bodies, as are the men like∣wise, and as soft and smooth as a mole-skin, of reasonable good complexions, but that they dye themselves tawnie, many prettie Brownetto's and spider finger'd L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses may be seen amongst them. The <HI>Vetula's</HI> or old women are lean and uglie, all of them are of a modest demeanor, considering their
<PB N="125" REF="67"/>Savage breeding; and indeed do shame our <HI>English</HI> rusticks whose rudeness in many things exceedeth theirs.</P>
<P>Of disposition very inconstant, crafty, timorous, quick of apprehension, and very ingenious, soon angry, and so malicious that they seldom forget an injury, and bar∣barously cruel, witness their direful reven∣ges upon one another. Prone to injurious violence and slaughter, by reason of their bloud dryed up with overmuch fire, very lecherous proceeding from choller adust and melancholy, a salt and sharp humour; very fingurative or theevish, and bold im∣portunate beggars, both Men and Women guilty of Misoxenie or hatred to strangers, a quality appropriated to the old Brittains, all of them Cannibals, caters of humane flesh. And so were formerly the Heathen-<HI>Irish,</HI> who used to feed upon the Buttocks of Boyes and Womens Paps; it seems it is natural to Savage people so to do. I have read in Relations of the <HI>Indians</HI> amongst the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that they would not eat a <HI>Spaniard</HI> till they had kept him two or three dayes to wax tender, because their flesh was hard. At <HI>Martins</HI> vinyard, an Island that lyes South to <HI>Plimouth</HI> in the way to <HI>Virgi∣nia,</HI> certain <HI>Indians</HI> (whilst I was in the Countrey) seised upon a Boat that put in∣to
<PB N="126" REF="68"/>to a By-<HI>Cove,</HI> kill'd the men and eat them up in a short time before they were disco∣vered.</P>
<P>Their houses which they call <HI>Wigwams,</HI> are built with Poles pitcht into the ground of a round form for most part, sometimes square, they bind down the tops of their poles, leaving a hole for smoak to go out at, the rest they cover with the bark of Trees, and line the inside of their <HI>Wigwams</HI> with mats made of Rushes painted with several colours, one good post they set up in the middle that reaches to the hole in the top, with a staff a cross before it at a convenient height, they knock in a pin on which they hang their Kettle, beneath that they set up a broad stone for a back which keepeth the post from burning; round by the walls they spread their mats and skins where the men sleep whilst their women dress theis victuals, they have commonly two doors, one ope∣ning to the South, the other to the North, and according as the wind sits, they close up one door with bark and hang a <HI>Dears</HI> skin or the like before the other. Towns they have none, being alwayes removing from one place to another for conveniency of food, sometimes to those places where one sort of fish is most plentiful, other whiles where others are. I have seen half
<PB N="127" REF="68"/>hundred of their <HI>Wigwams</HI> together in a piece of ground and they shew prettily, within a day or two, or a week they have been all dispersed. They live for the most part by the Sea-side, especially in the spring and summer quarters, in winter they are gone up into the Countrie to hunt <HI>Deer</HI> and <HI>Beaver,</HI> the younger webbs going with them. Tame Cattle they have none, ex∣cepting Lice, and Doggs of a wild breed that they bring up to hunt with.</P>
<P>Wives they have two or three, according to the ability of their bodies and strength of their concupiscence, who have the easieft labours of any women in the world; they will go out when their time is come alone, carrying a board with them two foot long, and a foot and half broad, bor'd full of holes on each side, having a foot beneath like a Jack that we pull Boots off with, on the top of the board a broad strap of lea∣ther which they put over their fore-head, the board hanging at their back; when they are come to a Bush or a Tree that they fancy they lay them down and are delivered in a trice, not so much as groaning for it, they wrap the child up in a young <HI>Beaver</HI>-skin with his heels close to his britch, leaving a little hole if it be a Boy for his Cock to peep out at; and lace him down to the
<PB N="128" REF="69"/>board upon his back, his knees resting upon the foot beneath, then putting the strap of leather upon their fore-head with the infant hanging at their back home they trudge; What other ceremonies they use more than dying of them with a liquor of boiled <HI>Hem∣lock</HI>-Bark, and their throwing of them into the water if they suspect the Child to be gotten by any other Nation, to see if he will swim, if he swim they acknowledge him for their own, their names they give them when they are men grown, and covet much to be called after our <HI>English</HI> manner, <HI>Robin, Harry, Phillip</HI> and the like, very in∣dulgent they are to their Children, and their children sometimes to their Parents, but if they live so long that they become a burden to them, they will either starve them or bury them alive, as it was supposed an <HI>Indian</HI> did his Mother at <HI>Casco</HI> in 1669.</P>
<P>Their Apparel before the <HI>English</HI> came amongst them, was the skins of wild Beasts with the hair on, Buskins of <HI>Deers</HI>-skin or <HI>Moose</HI> drest and drawn with lines into several works, the lines being coloured with yellow, blew or red, Pumps too they have, made of tough skins without soles. In the winter when the snow will bear them, they fasten to their feet their snow shooes which are made like a large Racket we play at
<PB N="129" REF="69"/><HI>Tennis</HI> with, lacing them with <HI>Deers</HI>-guts and the like, under their belly they wear a square piece of leather and the like upon their posteriors, both fastened to a string tyed about them to hide their secrets; on their heads they ware nothing: But since they have had to do with the English they purchase of them a sort of Cloth called trading cloth of which they make Mantles, Coats with short sleeves, and caps for their heads which the women use, but the men continue their old fashion going bare-head∣ed, excepting some old men amongst them. They are very proud as appeareth by their setting themselves out with white and blew Beads of their own making, and painting of their faces with the above mentioned colours, they weave sometimes curious Coats with <HI>Turkie</HI> feathers for their Children.</P>
<P>Their Diet is Fish and Fowl, Bear, Wild∣cat, Rattoon and Deer; dry'd Oysters, <HI>Lobsters</HI> rosted or dryed in the smoak, <HI>Lampres</HI> and dry'd <HI>Moose</HI>-tongues, which they esteem a dish for a <HI>Sagamor;</HI> hard eggs boiled and made small and dryed to thicken their broth with, falt they have not the use of, nor bread, their <HI>Indian</HI> Corn and Kid∣ney beans they boil, and sometimes eat their Corn parcht or roasted in the ear against the fire; they feed likewise upon earth-nuts,
<PB N="130" REF="70"/>or ground-nuts, rocts of water-Lillies, Ches-nuts, and divers sorts of Berries. They beat their Corn to powder and put it up into bags, which they make use of when stormie weather or the like will not suffer them to look out for their food. <HI>Pompiens</HI> and water-<HI>Mellons</HI> too they have good store; they have prodigious stomachs, devouring a cruel deal, meer <HI>voragoes,</HI> never giving over eating as long as they have it, between meals spending their time in sleep till the next kettlefull is boiled, when all is gone they satisfie themselves with a small quanti∣ty of the meal, making it serve as the fru∣gal bit amongst the old <HI>Britains,</HI> which taken to the mountenance of a Bean would satisfie both thirst and hunger. If they have none of this, as sometimes it falleth out (being a very careless people not providing against the storms of want and tempest of necessity) they make use of Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s remedy for hunger, go to sleep.</P>
<P>They live long, even to an hundred years of age, if they be not cut off by their Chil∣dren, war, and the plague, which together with the small pox hath taken away abun∣dance of them. <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iny</HI> reckons up but 300 Diseases in and about man, latter writers Six thousand, 236 belonging to the eyes. There are not so many Diseases raign∣ing
<PB N="131" REF="70"/>amongst them as our <HI>Europeans.</HI> The great pox is proper to them, by reason (as some do deem) that they are <HI>Man-eaters,</HI> which Dise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se was brought amongst our <HI>Europeans</HI> first by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that went with <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> who brought it to <HI>Naples</HI> with their <HI>Indian</HI>-women, with whom the <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>French</HI> conversed <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1493. <HI>Paracelsus</HI> saith it hap∣ned in the year 1478 and 1480. But all a∣gree that it was not known in <HI>Europe</HI> be∣fore <HI>Columbus</HI> his voyage to <HI>America.</HI> It hath continued amongst us above two hun∣dred and three score years. There are Dis∣eases that are proper to certain climates, as the Leprosie to <HI>Aegypt,</HI> swelling of the Throat or <HI>Mentegra</HI> to <HI>Asia,</HI> the sweating sickness to the Inhabitants of the North; to the <HI>Portugals</HI> the Phthisick, to <HI>Savoy</HI> the mumps; So to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> the Pox, but this doth not exclude other Diseases. In <HI>New-England</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> are afflicted with pestilent Feavers, Plague, Black-pox, Consumption of the Lungs, Falling-sick∣ness, Kings-evil, and a Disease called by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> the Plague in the back, with us <HI>Empyema,</HI> their Physicians are the <HI>Pow∣aws</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Priests who cure sometimes by charms and medicine, but in a general infection they seldom come amongst them,
<PB N="132" REF="71"/>therefore they use their own remedies, which is sweating, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Their manner is when they have plague or small pox amongst them to cover their <HI>Wigwams</HI> with Bark so close that no Air can enter in, lining them (as I said before) within, and making a great fire they remain there with a stewing heat till they are in a top sweat, and then run out into the Sea or River, and present∣ly after they are come into their Hutts a∣gain they either recover or give up the Ghost; they dye patiently both men and women, not knowing of a Hell to scare them, nor a Conscience to terrifie them. In times of general Mortality they omit the Ceremonies of burying, exposing their dead Carkases to the Beasts of prey. But at other times they dig a Pit and set the disea∣sed therein upon his breech upright, and throwing in the earth, cover it with the sods and bind them down with sticks, driving in two slakes at each end; their mournings are somewhat like the howlings of the <HI>Fish,</HI> seldom at the grave but in the <HI>Wigwam</HI> where the party dyed, blaming the Devil for his hard heartedness, and con∣cluding with rude prayers to him to afflict them to further.</P>
<P>They acknowledge a God who they call <HI>Squan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m,</HI> but worship him they do not,

<P>They worship the Devil (as I said) their Priests are called <HI>Powaws</HI> and are little bet∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than Witches, for they have familiar conference with him, who makes them invulnerable, that is shot-free and stick-free.

<P>Their Theologie is not much, but que∣stionless they acknowledge a God and a Devil, and some small light they have of the Souls immortality; for ask them whi∣ther
<PB N="135" REF="72"/>they go when they dye, they will tell you pointing with their finger to Heaven beyond the white mountains, and do hint at <HI>Noah</HI>'s Floud, as may be conceived by a story they have received from Father to Son, time out of mind, that a great while agon their Countrey was drowned, and all the People and other Creatures in it, only one <HI>Powaw</HI> and his <HI>Webb</HI> foreseeing the Floud fled to the white mountains carrying a hare along with them and so escaped, after a while the <HI>Powaw</HI> sent the <HI>Hare</HI> away, who not returning emboldned thereby they descended, and lived many years after, and had many Children, from whom the Countrie was filled again with <HI>Indians.</HI> Some of them tell another story of the <HI>Beaver,</HI> saying that he was their Father.</P>
<P>Their learning is very little or none, Poets they are as may be ghessed by their formal speeches, sometimes an hour long, the last word of a line riming with the last word of the following line, and the whole doth <HI>Constare ex pedibus.</HI> Musical too they be, having many pretty odd barbarous tunes which they make use of vocally at marria∣ges and feastings; but Instruments they had none before the <HI>English</HI> came amongst them, since they have imitated them and will make out Kitts and string them as neat∣ly,
<PB N="136" REF="73"/>and as Artificially as the best Fiddle∣maker amongst us; and will play our plain lessons very exactly: the only Fidler that was in the Province of <HI>Meyn,</HI> when I was there, was an <HI>Indian</HI> called <HI>Scezway,</HI> whom the Fishermen and planters when they had a mind to be merry made use of. Arithmetick they skill not, reckoning to ten upon their singers, and if more doub∣ling of it by holding their fingers up, their age they reckon by Moons, and their acti∣ons by sleeps, as, if they go a journie, or are to do any other business they will say, three sleeps me walk, or two or three sleeps me do such a thing, that is in two or three days. Astronomie too they have no knowledge of, seldom or never taking ob∣servation of the Stars, Eclipses, or Comets that I could perceive; but they will Prog∣nosticate shrewdly what weather will fall out.

<PB N="140" REF="75"/>pounds a Tun; the red heads of <HI>Deer</HI> are the fairest and fullest of marrow, and light∣est; the black heads are heavie and have less marrow; the white are the worst, and the worst nourished. When the <HI>Indians</HI> are gone, there gathers to the Carkass of the <HI>Moose</HI> thousands of <HI>Mattrises,</HI> of which there are but few or none near the Sea-coasts to be seen, these devour the remainder in a quar∣ter of the time that they were hunting of it.</P>
<P>Their fishing followes in the spring, sum∣mer and fall of the leaf.

<P>The <HI>Lobsters</HI> they take in large Bayes when it is low water, the wind still, going out in their <HI>Birchen-Canows</HI> with a staff two or three yards long, made small and sharpen'd at one end, and nick'd with deep nicks to take hold. When they spye the <HI>Lob∣ster</HI> crawling upon the Sand in two fathom water, more or less, they stick him towards the head and bring him up. I have known thirty <HI>Lobsters</HI> taken by an <HI>Indian</HI> lad in an hour and a half, thus they take <HI>Flouke</HI> and <HI>Lumps; Clams</HI> they dig out of the <HI>Clam∣banks</HI> upon the flats and in creeks when it is low water, where they are bedded some∣times
<PB N="141" REF="75"/>a yard deep one upon another, the beds a quarter of a mile in length, and less, the <HI>Alewives</HI> they take with Nets like a pursenet put upon a round hoop'd stick with a handle in fresh ponds where they come to spawn. The <HI>Bass</HI> and <HI>Blew-fish</HI> they take in harbours, and at the mouth of barr'd Rivers being in their <HI>Canows,</HI> striking them with a fisgig, a kind of dart or staff, to the lower end whereof they fasten a sharp jagged bone (since they make them of Iron) with a string fastened to it, as soon as the fish is struck they pull away the staff, leaving the bony head in the fishes body and fasten the other end of the string to the <HI>Canow:</HI> Thus they will hale after them to shore half a dozen or half a score great fishes: this way they take <HI>Sturgeon;</HI> and in dark evenings when they are upon the fish∣ing ground near a Bar of Sand (where the <HI>Sturgeon</HI> feeds upon small fishes (like <HI>Eals</HI>) that are called Lances sucking them out of the Sands where they lye hid, with their hollow Trunks, for other mouth they have none) the <HI>Indian</HI> lights a piece of dry <HI>Birch-Bark</HI> which breaks out into a flame &amp; holds it over the side of his <HI>Canow,</HI> the <HI>Sturgeon</HI> seeing this glaring light mounts to the Sur∣face of the water where he is slain and taken with a fisgig. <HI>Salmons</HI> and <HI>Lampres</HI>

All the Rivers of note in the Countrey have two or three desperate falls distant one from a∣nother for some miles, for it being rising ground from the Sea and mountainous with∣in land, the Rivers having their Originals from great lakes, and hastning to the Sea, in their passage meeting with Rocks that are not so easily worn away, as the loose earthie mould beneath the Rock, makes a fall of the water in some Rivers as high as a house: you would think it strange to see, yea admire if you saw the bold <HI>Barbarians</HI> in their light <HI>Canows</HI> rush down the swift and headlong stream with desperate speed, but with excellent dexterity, guiding his <HI>Canow</HI> that seldom or never it shoots under water or overturns, if it do they can swim naturally, striking their pawes under their throat like a dog, and not spreading their Arms as we do; they turn their <HI>Canow</HI> a∣gain and go into it in the water.</P>
<P>Their Merchandize are their beads, which are their money, of these there are two sorts, blew Beads and white Beads, the first is their Gold, the last their Silver, these they work out of certain shells so cunning∣ly that neither <HI>Jew</HI> nor Devil can counter∣feit, they dril them and string them, and make many curious works with them to a∣dorn
<PB N="143" REF="76"/>the persons of their <HI>Sagamours</HI> and principal men and young women, as Belts, Girdles, Tablets, Borders for their womens hair, Bracelets, Necklaces, and links to hang in their ears. Prince <HI>Phillip</HI> a little before I came for <HI>England</HI> coming to <HI>Boston</HI> had a Coat on and Buskins set thick with these Beads in pleasant wild works and a broad Belt of the same, his Accountrements were valued at Twenty pounds.

<P>The Countrey here is bless'd with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ichest soil in all <HI>New-England,</HI> I have heard it reported from men of Judgement and Integrity, that one Bushel of <HI>European-Wheat</HI> hath yielded a hundred in one year.

<P>The next Sea-Town Eastward of <HI>New-haven</HI> is called <HI>Guilford</HI> about ten mile, and I think belonging to that Colony.</P>
<P>From <HI>Guilford</HI> to <HI>Connecticut</HI>-River, is near upon twenty miles, the fresh River <HI>Connecticut</HI> bears the name of another Colo∣ny begun in the year 1636 and is also one of the four united Colonies.

<P><HI>Cape-Cod</HI> was so called at the first by Captain <HI>Gosnold</HI> and his Company <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1602, because they took much of that fish there; and afterward was called <HI>Cape-James</HI> by Captain <HI>Smith:</HI> the point of the <HI>Cape</HI> is called <HI>Point-Cave</HI> and <HI>Tuckers</HI> Terror, and by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch Mallacar,</HI> by reason of the perillous shoals. The first place to be taken notice of on the South-side of the <HI>Cape</HI> is <HI>Wests</HI>-Harbour, the first Sea-Town <HI>Sandwich</HI> formerly called <HI>Duxbury</HI> in the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-Plimouth.</HI> Doub∣ling the <HI>Cape</HI> we come into the great <HI>Bay,</HI> on the West whereof is <HI>New-Plimouth-Bay,</HI> on the Southwest-end of this <HI>Bay</HI> is situa∣ted <HI>New Plimouth,</HI> the first <HI>English</HI>-Colony that took firm possession in this Countrey, which was in 1620, and the first Town built

<PB N="159" REF="84"/>Ships commonly cast Anchor. <HI>Pullin-point</HI> is so called, because the Boats are by the seasing or Roads haled against the Tide which is very strong, it is the usual Channel for Boats to pass into <HI>Mattachusets-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>There is an Island on the South-side of the passage containing eight Acres of ground. Upon a rising hill within this Island is mounted a Castle commanding the en∣trance, no stately Edifice, nor strong; built with Brick and Stone, kept by a Captain, under whom is a master-Gunner and others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bay</HI> is large, made by many Islands, the chief <HI>Deere</HI>-Island, which is within a flight shot of <HI>Pullin-point,</HI> great store of <HI>Deere</HI> were wont to swim thither from the Main; then <HI>Bird</HI>-Island, <HI>Glass</HI>-Island, <HI>Slate</HI>-Island, the Governours Garden, where the first Apple-Trees in the Countrey were planted, and a vinyard; then <HI>Round</HI>-Island, and <HI>Noddles</HI>-Island not far from <HI>Charles</HI>-Town: most of these Islands lye on the North-side of the <HI>Bay.</HI></P>

<P>In the year of our Lord 1628, Mr. <HI>John Endicot</HI> with a number of <HI>English</HI> people set down by <HI>Capt-Aun</HI> at that place called

In 1637. there were not many houses in the Town of

<P><HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1646. they drew up a body of their Laws for the well ordering of their Commonwealth, as they not long since termed it.</P>
<P>The military part of their Common∣wealth is governed by one Major-General, and three Serjeant Majors; to the Major-General belongeth particularly the Town of <HI>Biston,</HI> to the three Serjeant Majors be∣long the four Counties, but with sub∣mission to the Major-General. The first Ser∣jeant Major chosen for the County of <HI>Suf∣folk</HI> was Major <HI>Gibbons.</HI> For the County of <HI>Middlesex</HI> Major <HI>Sedgwick.</HI> For the County of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Northfolk</HI> Major <HI>Denison.</HI></P>
<P>Every Town sends two Burgesses to their great and solemn general Court.</P>
<P>For being drunk, they either whip or im∣pose a fine of Five shillings; so for swearing and cursing, or boring through the tongue with a hot Iron.</P>
<P>For k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssing a woman in the street, though in way of civil salute, whipping or a fine.</P>
<P>For Single fornication whipping or a fine.</P>
<P>For Adultery, put to death, and so for Witchcraft.</P>
<P>An <HI>English</HI> woman suffering an <HI>Indian</HI> to have carnal knowledge of her, had an <HI>Indian</HI> cut out exactly in red cloth sewed
<PB N="179" REF="95"/>upon her right Arm, and injoyned to wear it twelve moneths.</P>
<P>Scolds they gag and set them at their doors for certain hours, for all comers and goers by to gaze at.</P>
<P>Stealing is punished with restoring four fould, if able; if not, they are sold for some years, and so are poor debtors.</P>
<P>If you desire a further inspection to their Laws, I must refer you to them being in print, too many for to be inserted into this Relation.</P>
<P>The Governments of their Churches are Independent and Presbyterial, every Church (for so they call their particular Congre∣gations) have one Pastor, one Teacher, Ruling Elders and Deacons.</P>
<P>They that are members of their Church∣es have the Sacraments administred to them, the rest that are out of the pale as they phrase it, are denyed it. Many hun∣dred Souls there be amongst them grown up to men &amp; womens estate that were never Christened.</P>
<P>They judge every man and woman to pay Five shillings <HI>per</HI> day, who comes not to their Assemblies, and impose fines of forty shillings and fifty shillings on such as meet together to worship God.</P>
<PB N="180" REF="96"/>
<P>Quakers they whip, banish, and hang if they return again.</P>
<P>Anabaptists they imprison, fine and weary out.</P>
<P>The Government both Civil and Eccle∣siastical is in the hands of the thorow-pac'd Independents and rigid Presbyterians.</P>
<P>The grose <HI>Goddons,</HI> or great masters, as also some of their Merchants are damnable rich; generally all of their judgement, inexplicably covetous and proud, they re∣ceive your gifts but as an homage or tribute due to their transcendency, which is a fault their Clergie are also guilty of, whose living is upon the bounty of their hearers. On Sundays in the afternoon when Sermon is ended the people in the Galleries come down and march two a breast up one Ile and down the other, until they come before the desk, for Pulpit they have none: before the desk is a long pue where the Elders and Deacons sit, one of them with a mony box in his hand, into which the people as they pass put their offering, some a shilling, some two shillings, half a Crown, five shil∣lings according to their ability and good will, after this they conclude with a Psalm; but this by the way.</P>
<P>The chiefest objects of discipline, Religi∣on,
<PB N="181" REF="96"/>and morality they want, some are of a <HI>Linsie-woolsie</HI> disposition, of several profes∣sions in Religion, all like <HI>Aethiopians</HI> white in the Teeth, only full of ludification and injurious dealing, and cruelty the extreamest of all vices. The chiefest cause of <HI>Noah</HI>'s floud, Prov. 27.26. <HI>Agni erant ad vestitum tuum,</HI> is a frequent Text among them, no trading for a stranger with them, but with a <HI>Graecian</HI> faith, which is not to part with your ware without ready money, for they are generally in their payments recusant and slow, great Syndies, or censors, or con∣trollers of other mens manners, and savagely factious amongst themselves.</P>
<P>There are main travelling women too, (in <HI>Salomon</HI>'s sence) more the pitty, when a woman hath lost her Chastity, she hath no more to lose.</P>
<P>But mistake me not to general speeches, none but the guilty take exceptions, there are many sincere and religious people amongst them, descryed by their charity and humility (the true Characters of Christia∣nity) by their Zenodochie or hospitality, by their hearty submission to their Sove∣raign the King of <HI>England,</HI> by their dili∣gent and honest labour in their callings, amongst these we may account the Royalists, who are lookt upon with an evil eye and
<PB N="182" REF="97"/>tongue, boulted or punished if they chance to lash out, the tame <HI>Indian</HI> (for so they call those that are born in the Countrey) are pretty honest too, and may in good time be known for honest Kings men.</P>
<P>They have store of Children, and are well accommodated with Servants; many hands make light work, many hands make a full fraught, but many mouths eat up all, as some old planters have experimented; of these some are <HI>English,</HI> others <HI>Negroes:</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> there are can eat till they sweat, and work till they freeze; &amp; of the females that are like Mrs. <HI>Winters</HI> paddocks, very tender fingerd in cold weather.</P>
<P>There are none that beg in the Countrey, but there be Witches too many, bottle-bel∣lied Witches amongst the Quakers, and others that produce many strange apparitions if you will believe report, of a <HI>Shallop</HI> at Sea man'd with women, of a Ship and a great red Horse standing by the main-mast, the Ship being in a small <HI>Cove</HI> to the East∣ward vanished of a suddain. Of a Witch that appeared aboard of a Ship twenty leagues to Sea to a Mariner who took up the Carpenters broad Axe and cleft her head with it, the Witch dying of the wound at home, with such like bugbears and <HI>Ter∣riculamentaes.</HI></P>
<PB N="183" REF="97"/>
<P>It is published in print, that there are not much less than Ten hundred thousand souls <HI>English, Scotch</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> in <HI>New-Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>Most of their first Magistrates are dead, not above two left in the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> but one at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> one at <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and one at <HI>New-haven,</HI> they having done their generation work are laid asleep in their beds of rest till the day of doom, there and then to receive their reward according as they have done be it good or evil. Things of great indurance we see come to ruine, and alter, as great Flouds and Seas dryed up; mighty hills and mountains sunk into hol∣low bottoms: marvel not then that man is mortal, since his nature is unconstant and transitory.</P>
<P>The Diseases that the <HI>English</HI> are affli∣cted with, are the same that they have in <HI>England,</HI> with some proper to <HI>New Eng∣land,</HI> griping of the belly (accompanied with Feaver and Ague) which turns to the bloudy-fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x, a common disease in the Coun∣trey, which together with the small pox hath carried away abundance of their children, for this the common medicines amongst the poorer sort are Pills of Cotton swallowed, or Sugar and Sallet-oyl boiled thick and made into Pills, Alloes pulverized
<PB N="184" REF="98"/>and taken in the pap of an Apple. I helped many of them with a sweating medicine only.</P>
<P>Also they are troubled with a disease in the mouth or throat which hath proved mortal to some in a very short time, Quinsies, and Impostumations of the Almonds, with great distempers of cold. Some of our <HI>New-England</HI> writers affirm that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> are never or very rarely heard to sneeze or cough, as ordinarily they do in <HI>England,</HI> which is not true. For a cough or stitch up∣on cold, Wormwood, Sage, Marygolds, and Crabs-claws boiled in posset-drink and drunk off very warm, is a soveraign medi∣cine.</P>
<P>Pleurisies and Empyemas are frequent there, both cured after one and the same way; but the last is a desperate disease and kills many. For the Pleurisie I have given <HI>Coriander</HI>-seed prepared, <HI>Carduus</HI>-seed, and <HI>Harts-horn</HI> pulverized with good success, the dose one dram in a cup of Wine.</P>
<P>The Stone terribly afflicts many, and the Gout, and Sciatica, for which take Onions roasted, peeled and stampt, then boil them with neats-feet oyl and Rhum to a plaister, and apply it to the hip.</P>
<P>Head-aches are frequent, Palsies, Drop∣sies, Worms, Noli-me-tangeres, Cancers,
<PB N="185" REF="98"/>pestilent Feavers. Scurvies, the body cor∣rupted with Sea-diet, Beef and Pork taint∣ed, Butter and Cheese corrupted, fish rot∣ten, a long voyage, coming into the search∣ing sharpness of a purer climate, causeth death and sickness amongst them.</P>
<P>Men and Women keep their complexi∣ons, but lose their Teeth: the Women are pittifully Tooth-shaken; whether through the coldness of the climate, or by sweet∣meats of which they have store, I am not able to affirm, for the Toothach I have found the following medicine very availa∣ble, Brimstone and Gunpowder compound∣ed with butter, rub the mandible with it, the outside being first warm'd.</P>
<P>For falling off of the hair occasioned by the coldness of the climate, and to make it curl, take of the strong water called Rhum and wash or bath your head therewith, it is an admirable remedie.</P>
<P>For kibed heels, to heal them take the yellowest part of Rozen, pulverize it and work it in the palm of your hand with the tallow of a Candle to a salve, and lay of it to the sore.</P>
<P>For frozen limbs, a plaister framed with Soap, Bay-salt, and Molosses is sure, or Cow-lung boiled in milk and applyed.</P>
<P>For Warts and Corns, bathe them with Sea-water.</P>
<PB N="186" REF="99"/>
<P>There was in the Countrey not long since living two men that voided worms seven times their length. Likewise a young maid that was troubled with a sore pricking at her heart, still as she lean'd her body or stept down with her soot to the one side or the other; this maid during her distemper voided worms of the length of a finger all hairy with black heads; it so fell out that the maid dyed; her friends desirous to dis∣cover the cause of the distemper of her heart, had her open'd, and found two crook∣ed bones growing upon the top of the heart, which as she bowed her body to the right or left side would job their points into one and the same place, till they had worn a hole quite through. At <HI>Cape-Porpus</HI> lived an honest poor planter of middle-ige, and strong of body, but so extreamly troubled with two lumps (or wens as I conjectured) within him, on each side one, that he could not rest for them day nor night, being of great weight, and swagging to the one side or the other, according to the motion or posture of his body; at last he dyed in <HI>Anno</HI> 1668 as I think, or thereabouts. Some Chirurgeons there were that proffered to open him, but his wife would not assent to it, and so his disease was hidden in the Grave.</P>
<PB N="187" REF="99"/>
<P>It is the opinion of many men, that the blackness of the <HI>Negroes</HI> proceeded from the curse upon <HI>Cham</HI>'s posterity, others a∣gain will have it to be the property of the climate where they live. I pass by other Philosophical reasons and skill, only render you my experimental knowledge: having a <HI>Barbarie-moor</HI> under cure, whose finger (prickt with the bone of a fish) was Im∣postumated, after I had lanc'd it and let out the Corruption the skin began to rise with proud flesh under it; this I wore away, and having made a sound bottom I incar∣nated it, and then laid on my skinning plaister, then I perceived that the <HI>Moor</HI> had one skin more than <HI>Englishmen;</HI> the skin that is basted to the flesh is bloudy and of the same Azure colour with the veins, but deeper than the colour of our <HI>Europeans</HI> veins. Over this is an other skin of a tawny colour, and upon that <HI>Epidermis</HI> or <HI>Cuticu∣la,</HI> the flower of the skin (which is that Snakes cast) and this is tawny also, the co∣lour of the blew skin mingling with the tawny makes them appear black. I do not peremptorily affirm this to be the cause, but submit to better judgment. More rari∣ties of this nature I could make known unto you, but I hasten to an end; only a word or two of our <HI>English</HI> Creatures, and then to Sea again.</P>
<PB N="188" REF="100"/>
<P>I have given you an Account of such plants as prosper there, and of such as do not; but so briefly, that I conceive it neces∣sary to afford you some what more of them. <HI>Plantain</HI> I told you sprang up in the Countrey after the <HI>English</HI> came, but it is but one sort, and that is broad-leaved plantain.</P>
<P><HI>Gilliflowers</HI> thrive exceedingly there and are very large, the Collibuy or humming-Bird is much pleased with them. Our <HI>English</HI> dames make Syrup of them without fire, they steep them in Wine till it be of a deep colour, and then they put to it spirit of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> it will keep as long as the o∣ther.</P>
<P><HI>Eglantine</HI> or sweet <HI>Bryer</HI> is best sowen with <HI>Juniper-berries,</HI> two or three to one <HI>Eglantine-berry</HI> put into a hole made with a stick, the next year separate and remove them to your banks, in three years time they will make a hedge as high as a man, which you may keep thick and handsome with cutting.</P>
<P>Our <HI>English Clover-grass</HI> sowen thrives very well.</P>
<P><HI>Radishes</HI> I have seen there as big as a mans Arm.</P>
<P><HI>Flax</HI> and <HI>Hemp</HI> flourish gallantly.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Wheat</HI> i. e. summer <HI>Wheat</HI> many
<PB N="189" REF="100"/>times changeth into <HI>Rye,</HI> and is subject to be blasted, some say with a vapour breaking out of the earth, others, with a wind North-east or North-west, at such time as it flowereth, others again say it is with light∣ning. I have observed, that when a land of <HI>Wheat</HI> hath been smitten with a blast at one Corner, it begins at the stem (which will be spotted and goes upwards to the ear making it fruitless: in 1669 the pond that lyeth between <HI>Water-town</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> cast its fish dead upon the shore, forc't by a mineral vapour as was conjectured.</P>
<P>Our fruit-Trees prosper abundantly, <HI>Apple-trees, Pear-trees, Quince-trees, Cherry-trees, Plum-trees, Barberry-trees.</HI> I have observed with admiration, that the Kernels sownor the Succors planted produce as fair &amp; good fruit, without graffing, as the Tree from whence they were taken: the Countrey is replenished with fair and large Orchards. It was affirmed by one Mr. <HI>Woolcut</HI> (a ma∣gistrate in <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colony) at the Cap∣tains Messe (of which I was) aboard the Ship I came home in, that he made Five hundred Hogsheads of <HI>Syder</HI> out of his own Orchard in one year. <HI>Syder</HI> is very plentiful in the Countrey, ordinarily sold for Ten shillings a Hogshead. At the Tap∣houses
<PB N="190" REF="101"/>in <HI>Boston</HI> I have had an Ale-quart spic'd and sweetned with Sugar for a groat, but I shall insert a more delicate mixture of it. Take of <HI>Maligo-Raisons,</HI> stamp them and put milk to them, and put them in an <HI>Hippocras</HI>-bag and let it drain out of it self, put a quantity of this with a spoonful or two of Syrup of <HI>Clove-Gilliflowers</HI> into every bottle, when you bottle your <HI>Syder,</HI> and your <HI>Planter</HI> will have a liquor that ex∣ceeds <HI>passada,</HI> the Nectar of the Coun∣trey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quinces, Cherries, Damsons,</HI> set the Dames a work, <HI>Marmalad</HI> and preserved <HI>Damsons</HI> is to be met with in every house. It was not long before I left the Countrey that I made <HI>Cherry-wine,</HI> and so may others, for there are good store of them both red and black.</P>
<P>Their fruit-trees are subject two dis∣eases, the <HI>Meazels,</HI> which is when they are burned and scorched with the Sun, and lowsiness, when the wood-peckers job holes in their bark: the way to cure them when they are lowsie is to bore a hole into the main root with an Augur, and pour in a quantity of Brandie or Rhum, and then stop it up with a pin made of the same Tree.</P>
<P>The first Neat carried thither was to
<PB N="191" REF="101"/><HI>New-Plimouth Anno</HI> 162 these thrive and increase exceedingly, but grow less in body than those they are bred of yearly.</P>
<P>Horses there are numerous, and here and there a good one, they let them run all the year abroad, and in the winter seldom pro∣vide any fother for them, (except it be Magistrates, great Masters and Troopers Horses) which brings them very low in flesh till the spring, and so crest fallen, that their crests never rise again. Here I first met with that excrescence called <HI>Hippomanes,</HI> which by some is said to grow on the forehead of a foal new cast, and that the Mare bites it off as soon as foaled; but this is but a fable. A neighbour at <HI>Black point</HI> having a Mare with foal tyed her up in his Barn, the next day she foaled, and the man stand∣ing by spied a thing like a foals tongue to drop out of the foals mouth, which he took up and presented me with it, telling me withall, that he had heard many won∣derful things reported of it, and that it was rank poyson. I accepted of it gladly and brought it home with me, when it was dry it lookt like Glow, but of a dark brown colour; to omit all other uses for it, this I can assure you that a piece of it soakt in warm water or cold, will take sport out of wollen Clothes being tub'd thereon.</P>
<PB N="192" REF="102"/>
<P><HI>Goats</HI> were the first small Cattle they had in the Countrey, he was counted no body that had not a Trip or Flock of <HI>Goats:</HI> a hee-<HI>Goat</HI> gelt at <HI>Michaelmas</HI> and turn'd out to feed will be fat in a moneths time, &amp; is as good meat as a weather. I was taught by a <HI>Barbary Negro</HI> a medicine which before I proceed any further I will impart unto you, and that was for a swelling under the throat. Take <HI>Goats</HI> hair and clay and boil them in fair water to a poultis, and apply it very warm.</P>
<P><HI>Sheep</HI> now they have good store, these and <HI>Goats</HI> bring forth two, sometimes three <HI>Lambs</HI> and <HI>Kids</HI> at a time.</P>
<P><HI>Hoggs</HI> are here innumerable, every plan∣ter hath a Heard, when they feed upon shell∣fish and the like, as they do that are kept near the Sea and by the fishers stages, they tast fishie and rank; but fed with white Oak-Acorns, or <HI>Indian</HI>-Corn and Pease there is not better Pork in the whole world: be∣sides they sometimes have the <HI>Meazels,</HI> which is known when their hinder legs are shorter than ordinary.</P>
<P><HI>Catts</HI> and <HI>Dogs</HI> are as common as in <HI>England,</HI> but our <HI>Dogs</HI> in time degenerate; yet they have gallant <HI>Dogs</HI> both for fowl &amp; wild Beasts all over the Countrey: the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> store themselves with them, being much
<PB N="193" REF="102"/>better for their turns, than their breed of wild dogs, which are (as I conceive) like to the <HI>Tasso</HI>-canes or mountain dogs in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>English</HI> Poultry too there is good store, they have commonly three broods in a year; the hens by that time they are three years old have spurs like the Cock, but not altogether so big, but as long, they use to crow often, which is so rare a thing in other Countries, that they have a proverb <HI>Gallina recinit</HI> a Hen crowes. And in <HI>England</HI> it is accounted ominous; therefore our Farmers wives as soon as they hear a Hen crow wring off her neck, and so they serve their spur'd Hens, because they should not break their Eggs with their spurs when they sit. In the year 1637. which was when I went my first Voyage to <HI>New-England</HI> a good woman brought aboard with her a lusty Cock and Hen that had horns like spurs growing out on each side of their Combs, but she spoiled the breed, killing of them at Sea, to feed upon, for she loved a fresh bit.</P>
<P>In <HI>Anno</HI> 1647/8. Certain <HI>Indians</HI> coming to our house clad in <HI>Deere-skin</HI> coats, desired leave to lodge all night in our kitchin, it be∣ing a very rainie season, some of them lay down in the middle of the Room, and o∣thers under the Table, in the morning they
<PB N="194" REF="103"/>went away before any of the people were up; the poultry had their breakfast usually in cold weather in the kitchin, and because they should not hinder the passing of the people too and again, it was thrown under the Table; in the afternoon they began to hang the wing, in the night the sickest dropt dead from the perch, and the next day most of them dyed; we could not of a sudden ghess at the cause, but thought the <HI>Indians</HI> had either bewitched, or poysoned them: it came at last into my head, seeing their Crops very full, or rather much swell'd, to open them, where I found as much <HI>Deers</HI> hair as Corn, they that pickt up none of the hair lived and did well.</P>
<P>In the year 1667. <HI>October</HI> the 7th amongst our poultry we had one white game Cock of the <HI>French</HI> k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, a bird of high price, when he was three years old he drooped and his spirit was quite gone; one of our <HI>Negro</HI> maids finding him in the yard dead brought him into the house and acquainted me with it. I caused her to draw him, when his guts were all drawn our she put in her hand again and felt a lump in his body as big as a half-peny loaf, strongly fastned to his back, and much ado she had to pull it out; I found it to be a tuff bag, containing stuff like liver, and very heavie, at one end
<PB N="195" REF="103"/>of the bag, another little bag filled with a fatty matter, his gizard, liver, and heart wasted. The Pipe or Roupe is a common disease amongst their poultry infecting one another with it. I conceive it cometh of a cold moisture of the brain, they will be very sleepie with it, the best cure for it is <HI>Garlick,</HI> and smoaking of them with dryed <HI>Hysope.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>September</HI> following my Arrivage in the <HI>Massachusets</HI> about the twelfth hour of the eight day, I shipt my self and goods in a Bark bound to the East-ward, meeting as we sailed out the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour of <HI>New-Netherlands,</HI> who was received and enter∣tained at <HI>Boston</HI> by the Governour and Magi∣strates with great solemnity. About nine of the clock at night we came to <HI>Salem</HI> and lay aboard all night.</P>
<P>The Ninth day we went ashore to view the Town which is a mile long, and lay that night at a Merchants house.</P>
<P>The Tenth day we came from <HI>Salem</HI> about twelve of the clock back to <HI>Marble-head:</HI> here we went ashore and recreated our selves with Musick and a cup of Sack and saw the Town, about ten at night we returned to our Bark and lay aboard.</P>
<P>The Eleventh being Saturday, and the wind contrary, we came to <HI>Charles-town,</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="104"/>again about twelve of the clock we took store of <HI>Mackarel.</HI></P>
<P>The Thirteenth being Monday, we went aboard again about nine of the clock in the morning and out to Sea, about Sun going down we took store of <HI>Mackarel.</HI> The wind was scanty all along, and in the night time we durst not bear much sail, because of the Rocks and foaming breakers that lay in our way.</P>
<P>The Fourteenth day we came up with <HI>Pascataway,</HI> or <HI>Pascatique,</HI> where there is a large River and a fair harbour, within here is seated a Colony, properly belonging to the Heirs of Captain <HI>Mason</HI> sometime since of <HI>London;</HI> but taken into the Colony of <HI>Massachusets,</HI> by what right I will not here discuss.</P>
<P>The chiefest places of note are the <HI>Bay</HI> or <HI>Harbour</HI> North from <HI>Boston,</HI> on the West∣side of the Harbour are built many fair houses, and so in another part called <HI>Straw∣berry-bank.</HI></P>
<P>By the Harbour is an Island which of late days is filled with buildings, besides there are two Towns more seated up higher upon the River, the one called <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver;</HI> the River∣banks are clothed with stately Timber, and here are two miles meadow land and arable enough; the other town is called <HI>Excester.</HI></P>
<PB N="197" REF="104"/>
<P>At the River <HI>Pascataway</HI> begins the Pro∣vince of <HI>Main:</HI> having pleased our selves with the sight of <HI>Pascataway</HI> at a distance we sailed on, and came to <HI>Black-point.</HI></P>
<P>The Fifteenth day, about eight of the clock at night, where the next day I was shrewdly pinched with a great frost, but having two or three bottles of excellent <HI>Passada,</HI> and good cheer bestowed upon me I made a shift to bear it out, and now we are in the Province of <HI>Main.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Main,</HI> (or the Countrey of the <HI>Troquoes</HI>) heretofore called <HI>Laconia</HI> or <HI>New-Summersetshire,</HI> is a Colony belong∣ing to the Grandson of Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> of <HI>Ashton Phillips</HI> in the County of <HI>Sommerset,</HI> the said Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> did expend in planting several parts of <HI>New-England</HI> above Twenty thousand pounds <HI>sterling,</HI> and when he was between three and four score years of age did personally engage in our Royal Martyrs service; and particularly in the Seige of <HI>Bristow,</HI> and was plundered and imprisoned several times, by reason whereof he was discountenanced by the pretended Commissioners for forraign plantations, and his Province incroached upon by the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Colony, who assumed the Government thereof. His Ma∣jestie that now Reigneth sent over his Com∣missioners
<PB N="198" REF="105"/>to reduce them within their bounds, and to put Mr. <HI>Gorges</HI> again into possession. But there falling out a contest about it, the Commissioners settled it in the Kings name (until the business should be de∣termined before his Majestie) and gave Commissions to the Judge of their Courts, and the Justices to Govern and Act accord∣ing to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> &amp; by such Laws of their own as were not repugnant to them: But as soon as the Commissioners were returned for <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Massachusets</HI> enter the province in a hostile manner with a Troop of Horse and Poot and turn'd the Judge and his Assistants off the Bench, Im∣prisoned the Major or Commander of the Militia, threatned the Judge, and some o∣thers that were faithful to Mr. <HI>Gorges</HI> inte∣rests. I could discover many other foul proceedings, but for some reasons which might be given, I conceive it not conveni∣ent to make report thereof to vulgar ears; <HI>&amp; quae supra nos nihil ad nos.</HI> Onely this I could wish, that there might be some considerati∣on of the great losses, charge and labour, which hath been sustained by the Judge, and some others for above thirty years in uphold∣ing the rights of Mr. <HI>Gorge</HI> and his Sacred Majesties Dominion against a many stubborn and elusive people.</P>

<P><HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1623. Mr. <HI>Robert Gorge,</HI> Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> brother had for his good service granted him by Patent from the Council of <HI>Plimouth</HI> all that part of the Land commonly called <HI>Massachusiack,</HI> situa∣ted on the North-side of the Bay of <HI>Massa∣chusets.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after this Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> had granted to him by Patent from the middest of <HI>Merrimack</HI> River to the great River <HI>Sagadehock,</HI> then called <HI>Laconia.</HI></P>
<P>In 1635. Capt. <HI>William Gorge,</HI> Sir <HI>Ferdi∣nand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s Nephew, was sent over Governour of the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> then called <HI>New-Summersetshire.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorge</HI> received a Charter-Royal from King <HI>Charles</HI> the first the third of <HI>April</HI> in the Fifttenth of his Raign, grant∣ing to him all that part and portion of <HI>New-England,</HI> lying and being between the River of <HI>Pascataway,</HI> that is, beginning at the entrance of <HI>Pascataway-harbour,</HI> and so to pass up the same into the River of <HI>New∣ichawanoe</HI> or <HI>Neqhechewanek,</HI> and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ugh the same unto the farthest head thereof aforesaid, North-eastward along the Sea∣coasts, for Sixty miles to <HI>Sagadehac</HI>-River to <HI>Kencheck,</HI> even as far as the head thereof, and up into the main land North-westward for the space of one hundred and twenty
<PB N="200" REF="106"/>miles. To these Territories are adjoyned the North half-Isle of <HI>Sholes,</HI> with several other Islands, it lyeth between 44 degrees and 45 of Northerly latitude. The River <HI>Canada</HI> on the North-east the Sea coast South, a∣mongst many large Royalties, Jurisdictions and Immunities was also granted to the said Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorge,</HI> the same Royalties, priviledges and franchises as are, or of right ought to be enjoyed by the Bishop of <HI>Durham</HI> in the County Palatine of <HI>Durham;</HI> the planters to pay for every hundred Acres of land yearly, two shillings six pence, that is such land as is given to them and their Heirs for ever.</P>
<P>The Officers by Patent are a Deputy Go∣vernour, a Chancellor, a Treasurer, a Marshal for Souldiers, and Admiraltie for Sea affairs, and a Judge of the Admiraltie, a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster of Ordinance, a Secretary, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Towns there are not many in this pro∣vince. <HI>Kittery</HI> situated not far from <HI>Pascata∣way</HI> is the most populous.</P>
<P>Next to that Eastward is seated by a Ri∣ver near the Sea <HI>Gorgiana,</HI> a Majoraltie, and the Metropolitan of the province.</P>
<P>Further to the Eastward is the Town of <HI>Wells.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cape-Porpus</HI> Eastward of that, where there is a Town by the Sea side of the same name,
<PB N="201" REF="106"/>the houses scatteringly built, all these Towns have store of salt and fresh marsh with arable land, and are well stockt with Cattle.</P>
<P>About eight or nine mile to the East∣ward of <HI>Cape-Porpus,</HI> is <HI>Winter harbour,</HI> a noted place for Fishers, here they have many stages.</P>
<P><HI>Saco</HI> adjoyns to this, and both make one scattering Town of large extent, well stored with Cattle, arable land and marshes, and a Saw-mill.</P>
<P>Six mile to the Eastward of <HI>Saco</HI> &amp; forty mile from <HI>Gorgiana</HI> is seated the Town of <HI>Black-point,</HI> consisting of about fifty dwel∣ling houses, and a Magazine or <HI>Dogonne,</HI> scatteringly built, they have store of neat and horses, of sheep near upon Seven or Eight hundred, much arable and marsh salt and fresh, and a Corn-mill.</P>
<P>To the Southward of the <HI>point</HI> (upon which are stages for fishermen) lye two small Islands beyond the <HI>point,</HI> North-east∣ward runs the River <HI>Spurwinch.</HI></P>
<P>Four miles from <HI>Black-point,</HI> one mile from <HI>Spurwinch</HI> River Eastward lyeth <HI>Rich∣mans-Island,</HI> whose longitude is 317 degrees 30 seconds, and latitude 43 degrees and 34 minutes, it is three mile in circumference, and hath a passable and gravelly ford on the
<PB N="202" REF="107"/>North-side, between the main and the Sea: at low-water, here are found excellent Whetstones, and here likewise are stages for fishermen.</P>
<P>Nine mile Eastward of <HI>Black-point</HI> lyeth scatteringly the Town of <HI>Casco</HI> upon a large Bay, stored with Cattle, Sheep, Swine, a∣bundance of marsh and Arable land, a Corn-mill or two, with stages for fishermen.</P>
<P>Further East-ward is the Town of <HI>Kene∣beck</HI> scated upon the River.</P>
<P>Further yet East-ward is <HI>Sagadehock,</HI> where there are many houses scattering, and all along stages for fishermen, these too are stored with Cattle and Corn lands.</P>
<P>The mountains and hills that are to be taken notice of, are first <HI>Acomentiens</HI> hills, between <HI>Kettery</HI> and <HI>Gorgiana,</HI> the high hills of <HI>Ossapey</HI> to the West-ward of <HI>Saco</HI> River, where the princely <HI>Pilhanaw</HI> Ayries, the white mountains, to the North-ward of <HI>Black point,</HI> the highest <HI>Terrasse</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> you have the description of it in my Treatise of the rarities of <HI>New-Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>A Neighbour of mine rashly wandering out after some stray'd Cattle, lost his way, and coming as we conceived by his Relation near to the head spring of some of the branches of <HI>Black point</HI> River or <HI>Saco</HI>-River,

<P>The ponds or lakes in this province are very large and many, out of which the great Rivers have their original; we read of the lake <HI>Balsena</HI> that is thirty miles about, here are that come very near to it, stored with all sorts of fresh water fish; and if you will believe report, in one of them huge fishes like Whales are to be seen, and some of them have fair Islands in them. Twelve mile from <HI>Casco-bay,</HI> and passable for men and horses, is a lake called by the <HI>Indians Sebug,</HI> on the brink thereof at one end is the famous Rock shap'd like a <HI>Moose-Deere</HI> or <HI>Helk,</HI> Diaphanous, and called the <HI>Moose-Rock.</HI> Here are found stones like Crystal, and <HI>Lapis Specularis</HI> or <HI>Muscovia</HI> glass both white and purple.</P>
<P>On the East-side of <HI>Black-point</HI> River upon a plain, close to the Sea-bank is a pond two mile in compass, fish it produceth, but those very small and black, and a num∣ber of Frogs and Snakes, and much fre∣quented

<P>The principal Rivers in the province of <HI>Main,</HI> are <HI>Pascataway</HI>-River, <HI>York</HI>-River, <HI>Keni∣bunck</HI>-River, near to this River clay bullets were cast up by a mineral vapour, this Ri∣ver is by the Town of <HI>Wells.</HI> Then <HI>Saco</HI>-River on the East-side of the Town, the shore Rockie all along on both sides, where musick echoes from several places: seven miles up the River is a great fall where abundance of <HI>Salmon,</HI> and <HI>Lamprons</HI> are taken at the fall; a great way up, the River runs upon the Rock, <HI>in rupibus defendendo efficis rivos,</HI> he cutteth out Rivers among the Rocks, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th <HI>Job,</HI> of the Almighty, <HI>Job</HI> 28.10.

Spur-winck</HI>-River is next, which by his near approach to <HI>Black-point</HI>-river maketh that neck of land almost an Island. Further East-ward is <HI>Kenebeck</HI>-river fifty leagues off of <HI>New-Plimouth</HI> East-ward, and <HI>Pechipsent</HI> famous
<PB N="205" REF="108"/>for multitudes of mighty large <HI>Sturgeon.</HI> The last river of the province East-ward is the great river <HI>Sagadehock</HI> where Sir <HI>John Pophams</HI> Colony seated themselves.</P>
<P>The chief harbours are <HI>Cape-porpus, Win∣ter harbour,</HI> in which are some small Islands, <HI>Black-point, Richmans-Island, Casco-bay</HI> the largest in the province full of Islands.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sagadehock</HI> to <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> is called the Duke of <HI>Yorkes</HI> province, here <HI>Pemma∣quid, Montinicus, Mobegan, Capeanawhagen,</HI> where Capt <HI>Smith</HI> fish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for <HI>Whales; Musca∣taquid,</HI> all fill'd with dwelling houses and stages for fishermen, and have plenty of Cat∣tle, arable land and marshes.</P>
<P><HI>Nova Scotia</HI> was sold by the Lord <HI>Star∣ling</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> and is now wholly in their possession.</P>
<P>Now we are come to <HI>New-found-land,</HI> which is over against the gulf of St. <HI>Law∣rence,</HI> an Island near as spacious as <HI>Ireland,</HI> and lyeth distant from the Continent as far as <HI>England</HI> is from the nearest part of <HI>France,</HI> and near half the way between <HI>Ire∣land</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> its longitude is 334 de∣grees 20 seconds, and North latitude 46 degrees 30 minutes, or as others will 53 minutes. <HI>The longitude of places are uncer∣tainly reported, but in latitudes most agree.
<PB N="206" REF="109"/>Longitude is the distance of the meridian of any place from the meridian which passeth over the Isles of</HI> Azores, <HI>where the beginning of longi∣tude is said to be. The meridian is a great circle dividing the Equinoctial at right Angles into two equal parts, passing also through both the Poles, and the Zenith, to which circle the Sun coming twice every</HI> 24 <HI>hours, maketh the middle of the day, and the middle of the night. Every place hath a several meridian, but they all meet in the poles of the world. Latitude is counted from the Equinoctial to the end of</HI> 30 <HI>degrees on each side thereof. The Equinoctial is a great circle imagined in the Heavens, also dividing the heavens into two equal parts, and lying just in the middle be∣twixt the two poles, being in compass from West to East,</HI> 360 <HI>degrees, every degree thereof on the terrestrial Globe valuing</HI> 20 <HI>English miles, or</HI> 60 <HI>miles.</HI></P>
<P>Into the Bay of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> the River of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> or <HI>Canada</HI> disimbogues it self, a River far exceeding any River in the elder world, thirty or forty mile over at the mouth, and in the Channel one hundred fa∣thom deep; it runs on the back-side of <HI>New England</HI> and <HI>Virginia:</HI> the <HI>French</HI> (it is said) have gone up six weeks voy∣age in it, and have not yet discovered the spring-head: the longitude is 334 degrees
<PB N="207" REF="109"/>11 seconds, in 50 degrees 21 minutes of North latitude. This may satisfie a modest Reader, and I hope yield no offence to any. I shall onely speak a word or two of the people in the province of <HI>Main</HI> and the Dukes province, and so conclude.</P>
<P>The people in the province of <HI>Main</HI> may be divided into Magistrates, Husbandmen, or Planters, and fishermen; of the Magi∣strates some be Royalists, the rest perverse Spirits, the like are the planters and fishers, of which some be planters and fishers both, others meer fishers.</P>
<P>Handicrafts-men there are but few, the Tumelor or Cooper, Smiths and Carpen∣ters are best welcome amongst them, shop∣keepers there are none, being supplied by the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Merchants with all things they stand in need of, keeping here and there fair Magazines stored with <HI>English</HI> goods, but they set excessive prices on them, if they do not gain <HI>Cent per Cent,</HI> they cry out that they are losers, hence <HI>English</HI> shooes are sold for Eight and Nine shillings a pair, worsted stockins of Three shillings six pence a pair, for Seven and Eight shillings a pair, Douglass that is sold in <HI>England</HI> for one or two and twenty pence an ell, for four shil∣lings a yard, Serges of two shillings or three shillings a yard, for Six and Seven
<PB N="208" REF="110"/>shillings a yard, and so all sorts of Com∣modities both for planters and fishermen, as Cables, Cordage, Anchors, Lines, Hooks, Nets, Canvas for Sails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Bisket twenty five shillings a hundred, Salt at an excessive rate, pickled-herrin for winter bait Four and five pound a barrel (with which they speed not so well as the waggish lad at <HI>Cape-porpus,</HI> who baited his hooks with the drown'd <HI>Negro</HI>'s buttocks) so for Pork and Beef.</P>
<P>The planters are or should be restless pains takers, providing for their Cattle, planting and sowing of Corn, fencing their grounds, cutting and bringing home fuel, cleaving of claw-board and pipe-staves, fishing for fresh water fish and fowling takes up most of their time, if not all; the dili∣gent hand maketh rich, but if they be of a droanish disposition as some are, they become wretchedly poor and miserable, scarce able to free themselves and family from impor∣tunate famine, especially in the winter for want of bread.</P>
<P>They have a custom of taking Tobacco, sleeping at noon, sitting long at meals some∣times four times in a day, and now and then drinking a dram of the bottle extraodinari∣ly: the smoaking of Tobacco, if moderate∣ly used refresheth the weary much, and so doth sleep.</P>
<PB N="209" REF="110"/>
<Q><L>A Traveller five hours doth crave</L>
<L>To sleep, a Student seven will have,</L>
<L>And nine sleeps every Idle knave.</L></Q>
<P>The Physician allowes but three draugh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s at a meal, the first for need, the second for pleasure, and the third for sleep; but little observed by them, unless they have no other liquor to drink but water. In some places where the springs are frozen up, or at least the way to their springs made unpassable by reason of the snow and the like, they dress their meat in <HI>Aqua Caelestis,</HI> i. e. melt∣ed snow, at other times it is very well cookt, and they feed upon (generally) as good flesh, Beef, Pork, Mutton, Fowl and fish as any is in the whole world besides.</P>
<P>Their Servants which are for the most part <HI>English,</HI> when they are out of their time, will not work under half a Crown day, although it be for to make hay, and for less I do not see how they can, by reason of the dearness of clothing. If they hire them by the year, they pay them Fourteen or Fif∣teen pound, yea Twenty pound at the years end in Corn, Cattle and fish: some of these prove excellent fowlers, bringing in as many as will maintain their masters house; be∣sides the profit that accrews by their feathers.
<PB N="210" REF="111"/>They use (when it is to be had) a great round shot, called <HI>Barstable</HI> shot, (which is best for fowl) made of a lead blacker than our common lead, to six pound of shot they allow one pound of powder, Cannon pow∣der is esteemed best.</P>
<P>The fishermen take yearly upon the coasts many hundred kentals of Cod, hake, had∣dock, polluck <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they split, salt and dry at their stages, making three voyages in a year. When they share their fish (which is at the end of every voyage) they separate the best from the worst, the first they call M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rchantable fish, being sound, full grown fish and well made up, which is known when it is clear like a Lanthorn horn and without spots; the second sort they call re∣fuse fish, that is such as is salt burnt, spotted, rotten, and carelesly ordered: these they put off to the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Merchants; the mer∣chantable for thirty and two and thirty ryals a kental, (a kental is an hundred and twelve pound weight) the refuse for Nine shillings and Ten shillings a kental, the Merchant sends the merchantable fish to <HI>Lisbanne, Bilbo, Burdeaux, Marsiles, Tallo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, Rochel, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an,</HI> and other Cities of <HI>France,</HI> to the <HI>Canaries</HI> with cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-board and pipe∣staves which is there and at the <HI>Charibs</HI> a prime Commodity: the refuse fish they put
<PB N="211" REF="111"/>off at the <HI>Charib-Islands, Barbadoes, Jamaica,</HI> &amp;c. who seed their <HI>Negroes</HI> with it.</P>
<P>To every Shallop belong four fishermen, a Master or Steersman, a Midship-man, and a Foremast-man, and a shore man who washes it out of the salt, and dries it upon hurdles pitcht upon stakes breast high and tends their Cookery; these often get in one voyage Eight or Nine pound a man for their shares, but it doth some of them little good, for the Merchant to increase his gains by putting off his Commodity in the midst of their voyages, and at the end thereof comes in with a walking Tavern, a Bark laden with the Legitimate bloud of the rich grape, which they bring from <HI>Phial, Madera, Ca∣naries,</HI> with <HI>Brandy, Rhum,</HI> the <HI>Barbadoes strong-water,</HI> and <HI>Tobacco,</HI> coming ashore he gives them a Taster or two, which so charms them, that for no perswasions that their im∣ployers can use will they go out to Sea, al∣though fair and seasonable weather, for two or three days, nay sometimes a whole week till they are wearied with drinking, taking ashore two or three Hogsheads of <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Rhum</HI> to drink off when the Merchant is gone.
