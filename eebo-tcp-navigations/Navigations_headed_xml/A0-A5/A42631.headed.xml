<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hey that aspire to the Attainment of Wis∣dom, do not content themselves with the Accurate Search of sublime objects, but also conde∣scend to enquire into lower matters. In like manner, the renowned <HI>Bri∣tains</HI> do not confine their contem∣plations to their own homes, or to
<PB REF="5"/>
their neighbour Nations; but en∣large their prospect unto the most remote Countries, and with a piercing Eye, diligently pursue the exact discovery of their state and condition. To which purpose, many persons of honour, and of curiosity, have importun'd me to give some description of the Coasts of <HI>Ionia,</HI> and the <HI>Aegaean</HI> Islands; and to declare the present Condi∣tion of those great objects of Pity and Protection, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> now under the cruel Tyranny of the Wicked and Barbarous <HI>Hagarens.</HI> The desire I had to gratifie their learned curiosity, whose Judge∣ments I had reason highly to esteem, prevail'd with me to undertake a Description of some Isles of the <HI>Archipebago,</HI> namely, <HI>Samos, Ni∣caria, Patmos,</HI> and Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> now called <HI>The Holy Mount.</HI> But because this Work may seem to want that Elegance, or depth of learning, re∣quisite for a Book that must appear upon the Stage of <HI>England,</HI> it stands in need of shelter and protection.

Which put me upon the bold neces∣sity of flying to the Shadow of your Royal Highness's Patronage, to escape the scorchings of Contempt, and with all humble Reverence, to shelter it under the umbrage of your Royal Highness's propitious Name. And I most humbly offer it, not as a thing of any merit; but as a mani∣festation of my <HI>devoir</HI> and gratitude, for those great Obligations, which I, and in me all the <HI>Greek</HI> Nation has received. I therefore most humbly beseech your Highness, that as you have thought me worthy of your Bounty, so to continue the same fa∣vourable aspect, in accepting this small demonstration of my Grati∣tude, and by your gracious Patro∣nage, to secure it from their censure, who are not so forward to imitate our well intended pains, as to ex∣pose our defects. For which unde∣served Favour, we can make Retri∣bution only in our daily Prayers to Almighty God for your Highness's Health and Prosperity in this World, and Eternal Happiness in the World to come.</P>

<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THe habitable Earth, by Di∣vine disposal, bestow'd upon the Children of Men, is but one great Island. And those Four eminent Parts of it which divide the whole among them, not by equal portions, but by the casual in∣tervention of Seas, are not totally separated one from another; but make one perpetual Continent. <HI>Africa</HI> is joyn'd to <HI>Asia,</HI> by no very small neck of Land betwixt the Mediterranean and the Red Sea: And is no more an Island properly so call'd, than <HI>Peloponnesus. Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> are joyn'd above the Lake of <HI>Maeotis</HI> with a large space of ground betwixt the <HI>Hyperborean</HI> Oce∣an, and that Lake. And <HI>Asia</HI> is joy∣ned to <HI>America,</HI> by the Streights of
<PB REF="6"/>
<HI>Anian</HI> in all probability. There has nothing yet been discover'd to the con∣trary, and the great Absurdities that attend the peopling of it are no way so∣easily solv'd. Besides this Main Con∣tinent which is mounted above the Face of the Waters in one entire continua∣tion of parts, there are many lesser Islands, entirely surrounded by the Sea, and divided from all other ground. And all these are but smaller Sisters to that great product of Nature, the Main Continent, not differing from it in kind, but in bulk and size. Whether they owe their birth to the general De∣luge, or date their antiquity from the day of the Creation, the Scripture is silent, and so am I. The Opinion of several Islands being rent from the Main Continent, by the violent Incur∣sion of Seas, has been more forwardly embrac'd, than convincingly prov'd, and owes more to Poetical Fancy, than to any solid Foundations of Philosophy. However, certain it is, that many Islands are of later Antiquity than either the Creation, or the Flood, as on the contrary, many have either
<PB REF="7"/>
subsided, or been over-whelm'd.</P>
<P>The same Earthquake does sometimes produce both effects; and the same time brings Birth to one, and Burial to another. But these are the irregular miscarriages of nature, labouring un∣der a Convulsion Fit, and teach us what may be, not what must be; what na∣ture may sometimes suffer, not what she always doth. As for the whole Globe of Earth and Water, the admi∣rable intermixture of them both for use and beauty, doth highly bespeak the Wisdome of the Maker, and doth no less merit our contemplation, than the Canopy of Heaven. And that the rather, because the inferiour World doth more neerly approach our Senses, and affords us clearer notice of their state and condition. Among all the associate Collection of Islands, that by reason of their mutual vicinity, pass under one common name, there are none more remarkable than those of the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea, or the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> These were so eminent in the days of the Prophets of the Old Testament, that from them all the Western parts of
<PB REF="7"/>
the then known World that was plan∣ted principally by the Sons of <HI>Japhet,</HI> went under the common name of the Isles of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and the Islands of <HI>Chittim.</HI> The <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> the first eminent Navigators since the Flood, and the first Planters of Lear∣ning and Civility, as well as Colonies, along the shores of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> and <HI>Atlantick</HI> Seas, began their discoveries in these Islands: And there they have left such visible Foot∣steps of their first Plantation, that the names they bear to this day are most of them of <HI>Phoenician</HI> Extraction. The Colonies planted in these Islands by the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> gave beginning to all those Arts and Sciences for which the <HI>Greeks</HI> were afterwards so famous, and their Language been held in such admiration to this day. The <HI>Aethio∣pick</HI> Islands are known all by <HI>Greek</HI> names; but they are as far inferiour to the <HI>Cyclades</HI> in renown, as they are in number, having neither been the Scene of Actions recorded by such Im∣mortal pens, nor the native Soil of persons so eminent for Arts and Arms.
<PB REF="8"/>
The conceit of <HI>Elysium,</HI> or such a future happiness as the <HI>Heathens</HI> dream't of, was thought fit by their Poets to be fix'd upon some remote Islands; therefore call'd the <HI>Blessed,</HI> or <HI>Fortunate Islands.</HI> The <HI>Hespe∣rides</HI> and <HI>Canaries</HI> have been Compe∣titors for the Title, and our modern sear∣chers into <HI>Brittish</HI> Antiquity do strain hard to make the <HI>Cassiterides,</HI> or the <HI>Scilly</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> and <HI>Anglesey,</HI> put in for a claim. But the Poets have been more accurate in maintaining the Cha∣racter of an earthly Paradise, and describing a felicity of state beyond that of a <HI>Platonick,</HI> or <HI>Utopian</HI> Commonwealth, than in directing us by any rules of Geography, where it is to be found. And as they have left it indifferent to the Reader to fix the Local Situation of such Islands where they will, so they have left it impossi∣ble to any Reader to find such a place in the whole World. Indeed it is the high prerogative of great and lasting Wits to affix an esteem and veneration upon those places they make the Stage of their Stories, be they true or false.
<PB REF="8"/>
But in this point of credit, the Islands of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> do far surpass any other in the World. And this is true, not only of the licentious and extra∣vagant Fables of their Romantick <HI>My∣thologie;</HI> but also in the graver and more creditable Records of sober History. They did heretofore in a manner en∣gross the Monopoly of all the Wit and Fancy both of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome:</HI> Insomuch, that 'tis hardly possible for a man well vers'd in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues, to be a stranger to the antient Geography of these Places: And <HI>Pliny,</HI> who was in nothing less erroneous, than in this part of his natural History of these Islands, does honour the Bay wherein they are situate, with the Ti∣tle of <HI>Sinus claritatis literarum.</HI> A large <HI>Encomium,</HI> and such as no other aggregate body of Islands had equal right to. The <HI>Japan, Philip∣pine,</HI> and <HI>Molucco</HI> Islands in the <HI>Oriental Ocean,</HI> are far beyond these for number; but the only thing they are sought for is some natural products peculiar to their Soil and Climate, in which commendation, they do not ex∣ceed
<PB REF="9"/>
the late discoveries in the <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> Ocean; but we find not that the World was ever beholding to the one, or the other, for the Propagation of Learning or Civility. Nor is it only fa∣mous for the early rise of Humane Lear∣ning and civil Culture, in the days of <HI>Gentilism;</HI> but also for the early appea∣rance of the more glorious Sun-shine of the Heavenly Doctrin of the Gospel. St. <HI>John</HI> the Divine, honoured in the Oracles of God, with the peculiar Title of <HI>the Disciple whom Jesus loved,</HI> was once an Inhabitant of these Islands; where he founded the <HI>Christian</HI> Reli∣gion, and writ that Divine and Myste∣rious Book, which was indeed to him <HI>Apocalypse,</HI> but to all future ages <HI>Apocrypha.</HI> St. <HI>Paul,</HI> that great Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> did often cross this Sea, to plant the Doctrin of Salva∣tion in all the neighbouring Shores of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI> And in future ages, when the Divine Providence rai∣sed up a <HI>Christian</HI> Emperour to protect his Church from persecution, these Islands were the very centre of once the most Orthodox and learned Church in
<PB REF="9"/>
the World. To whom we owe not only the transmitting the Holy Scriptures to our knowledge; but also the digesting the Doctrin of them into Articles of Faith, the defence of Truth against all invasion of Errour, the faithful Re∣cords of most pure and primitive Tra∣dition, the clear Exposition of many obscure passages, which without their direction, might have been at this day unintelligible, and the great advan∣tage of many bearned and elaborate Volumes of Orthodox Divinity, both Polemical and Practick. And of all those many different Sects of <HI>Christi∣anity</HI> in the East, they have to this day most firmly retain'd the ancient Truths, and made the least Deviation into Er∣rour. If that ignorance which those barbarous extinguishers of learning, the <HI>Turks,</HI> keep them in, renders that afflicted Nation obnoxious to be impos'd upon, and incapable of knowing better, it deserves rather our pity, than our contempt and scorn. It is rather a Mi∣racle of Gods gracious Providence, that under such tyrannous Masters, and such proud and contemptuous enemies of
<PB REF="10"/>
the common name of <HI>Christianity,</HI> the light of Evangelical Truth is not only dim'd, but utterly extinct, as it has hap∣ned in the <HI>Latin</HI> Church in <HI>Africa,</HI> once inferiour to none for purity of Doctrin, and piety and learning in their Profes∣sours. Yet this cannot be deny'd them, but that they accord with us in many things wherein we differ from the <HI>Ro∣mish</HI> Church. I may add this more, that in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the <HI>Greek</HI> Church doth not bear that confor∣mity or similitude with the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, as the great Champions for <HI>Po∣pery</HI> would affix upon them. And that will easily appear in these particulars. 1. They use not the Elevation of the Host. 2. No carrying it in Procession. 3. The People stand when they receive it. 4. They give it in both kinds to all. 5. The bread is of a common sort before Consecration. It is besides, the business of this Preface, to enlarge upon the present State of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, which the reverend Author hath in some measure done in his account of <HI>Sa∣mos,</HI> and Mount <HI>Athos:</HI> And that subject is more largely handl'd by a late
<PB REF="10"/>
learned Author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Smith</HI>'s remarks upon the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Tongues. All that I shall add is, that scarce any part of <HI>Greece</HI> has less intermixture with the <HI>Turks</HI> than these Isles, where the <HI>Greek</HI> Lan∣guage and Religion is less intrench'd up∣on. There are no less than twenty Bishops in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> some with the Title of <HI>Metropolite,</HI> as <HI>Mete∣lyn</HI> and <HI>Methymia;</HI> others with the Title of Arch-Bishop, as <HI>Samos,</HI> and <HI>Andros,</HI> and some with the bare Title of Bishop, as <HI>Sciathus.</HI> Yet neither of the two first differ from the last in any thing, but in Title, or priority of Place. Their jurisdiction is alike, it being ordinary here for a <HI>Metropolite,</HI> and an Arch-Bishop to be without a <HI>Suffragan.</HI> The reason is, because of the great Revolutions, many of the old Bishopricks are lost, and the ancient frame of Ecclesiastical Polity much alter'd. The Patriarch continues the Title of <HI>Metropolite</HI> upon all the places that formerly were so, and the litle of Arch-Bishop, upon those that depend immediately upon the Patriarch, with∣out any subjection to a <HI>Metropolite,</HI>
<PB REF="11"/>
although they have no Bishop under their jurisdiction. The following Trea∣tise giveth an account of three Islands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> and Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> the Great <HI>Academy</HI> for the <HI>Greek</HI> Clergy. In all these places, he liv'd, and writes nothing, but what he saw, or what he receiv'd from the constant Tradition of the places: So that as to matters of fact, he may be better rely'd upon than those that write of places to which they are great stran∣gers. For the Truth of what is rela∣ted, is the main <HI>Postulatum</HI> of an Hi∣story.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION Of the ISLE of SAMOS: AND <HI>Of its present State at this Day.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Amos,</HI> is one of the greatest, and most re∣markable Islands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> situ∣ate near the Conti∣nent of <HI>Asia.</HI> It is well known that this was the Coun∣try of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and once was Go∣vern'd by Kings of her own, and has made stout resistance against <HI>Athens,</HI> what time they both liv'd under a Democratical Government. The ruins which yet are to be seen
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
there are a Testimony of her former greatness and wealth. But this Island hath been subject to great changes and revolutions, even to utter desertion of Inhabitants for many Years. Yet it being my main intent to give an account of its present State, I shall wave the for∣mer Transactions of Ancient times, whereof there is frequent mention amongst Historians, and proceed to a survey of its condition in these Modern Times, under the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire; how it is now Govern'd; what Revenues it yields, with a Geographical Description of the Country.</P>
<P>It is certain, that what time it pleas'd God for our sins to permit the <HI>Turks</HI> to subdue <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> the Island of <HI>Samos</HI> was totally dispeopl'd. Af∣terwards one <HI>Kilitch Aly Basha</HI> ar∣rived here, and Landing with a small Company to Hunt, was so taken with the place, that he was resolv'd to ask leave of the Grand Signior, to re-people the Island:
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
Which having done, he transpor∣ted several Families from all the Voisinage especially from <HI>Metelyne,</HI> so that by degrees, it became full of Inhabitants, and now counts to the number of 18 Towns and Vil∣lages, which I shall now describe according to their Situation.</P>
<P>The Isle of <HI>Samos</HI> is 26, or 27 <HI>French</HI> Leagues in compass, and lies in length East and West. At the West end it has the Isle of <HI>Nicaria,</HI> some twelve Miles distant: The East end is so near the Continent of <HI>Asia,</HI> that in some places men can Discourse one with another from the two Shores. This near∣ness of the East end of <HI>Samos</HI> to the Continent of <HI>Asia,</HI> causes a nar∣row Frith about six Miles in length, no where above 3 Miles in breadth, which by reason of little Islands in it, is a great Nest of Pirats, whom no Ships that come into this Strait can escape, but by putting to Shore on each side, where they are in equal danger of being made a Prey. These Pirats for the most part are
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
either from <HI>Malta, Legorn, Savoy,</HI> or <HI>Sardinia.</HI></P>
<P>At the entrance into this Streight, which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Dardbogazy, i. e.</HI> The Mouth of the Streight, lies all along the Mountain for the space of a Mile, the place where the Old City of <HI>Samos</HI> stood, remarkable<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Old</HI> Samos</NOTE> yet for some remainders of the Walls and ruins of old Churches, and large Stones, some 3, some 4, some 5 yards long, besides many Marbles and Pillars, notwithstan∣ding the many choice pieces carried away by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> when they were Lords of the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> But the <HI>Greeks</HI> at this day dare not touch a Stone, so much as to Build with, for fear of Imprisonment by the <HI>Turks,</HI> under colour of having found a Treasure in those old Ruins.</P>
<P>And being once Imprison'd upon such a pretence, they are sure to lye fast till all they have be seiz'd.</P>
<P>These Ruins are no less than six miles in compass. Upon the same Mountain in the middle of a deep and large Grotto, stands a Church
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
Dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> known there by the name of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Panagia Spiliani, <HI>St.</HI> Maries of the Cave Spiliani, <HI>from</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>Panagia Spiliani,</HI> or The most Holy Virgin of the Grot∣to. All the <HI>Samians</HI> pay great De∣votion to this place, not only in honour of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> but for the belief of many Miracles there done. Here is also an artifi∣cial Channel, six Miles long, drawn from a River of a perpetual stream, which besides the Mills it drives, does water the Country in times of greatest drought. This water arising near the Village of the <HI>Arnhauts</HI> (of whom we shall speak more hereafter) becomes large e∣nough by new supplies of other Currents, to deserve the name of a River, and is that which the An∣cients call'd <HI>Imbrasus.</HI></P>
<P>At the bottom of the aforesaid Mountain, where Old <HI>Samos</HI> stood, towards <HI>Scirus,</HI> lye the Ruins of an old Haven for Galleys; the <HI>Samians</HI> call it <HI>Tegani,</HI> i. e. <HI>Bason,</HI> from its roundness. Near to which Port stands a little Church Dedicated
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St.</HI> Ni∣cholas.</NOTE> St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> but now become a Refuge for the Mariners, who come privately to fetch Water from a Well hard by, that has a most ex∣cellent Spring: Yet here is always a strict Watch kept, one by Day, and two by Night, to carry Intel∣ligence to the next <HI>Aga,</HI> or the next <HI>Caddee,</HI> what Ships come in, whence they are, and whither bound; And if the <HI>Aga,</HI> or <HI>Caddee,</HI> happen to hear of any Ships coming by some other Messenger, before he that is to Watch, brings the News, he is sure to receive 500 Bastinadoes upon the Soles of his Feet for his neglect.</P>
<P>Over-against the Old City, about<NOTE PLACE="marg">* <HI>Megale Chora,</HI> or <HI>New Sa∣mos.</HI></NOTE> a Mile distant to the West, stands the New, now known by the name of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Megale Chora,</HI> or the great Town, because it is big∣ger than the rest of the Isle. Here the principal Men of the Isle have their residence, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Arch-bi∣shop, the <HI>Caddee,</HI> with three or four <HI>Turkish</HI> Families, the <HI>Aga,</HI> with ten or a dozen other <HI>Turks</HI> to assist
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
him in the Execution of his Charge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caddees</HI> Office is to pro∣nounce Law, and the <HI>Aga</HI>'s to put it into Execution, and to Levy all Taxes whatsoever. There are ma∣ny who submit themselves to the Jurisdiction of the Arch-bishop, especially the Ecclesiasticks. But if any Man rest unsatisfied with the Arch-bishops Judgment, he many appeal to the <HI>Caddee.</HI> There are very few <HI>Turks</HI> in this Isle, besides the forementioned. They had a Mosque, but the <HI>Venetians</HI> batter'd it down the first time they came with their Fleet to subdue the Island to their obedience, and to oblige them to contribution. But the <HI>Samians</HI> at first refus'd to pay Contribution, or to appear before the General, but made their escape into the Moun∣tains, fearing the <HI>Venetians</HI> would soon be repuls'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and they be chastis'd for so quick a Re∣volt.

the <HI>Aga</HI> and <HI>Caddee,</HI> gave permission to the Islanders to pay a yearly tri∣bute of 80000 Dollers or Crowns to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> Yet after the Peace made, when the <HI>Turks</HI> were re-establish'd, they would neither repair their batter'd Mosque, nor build a new one, for fear of some such casualty.

<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
the Collector of this Poll-Money (whom they call <HI>Haratchgy</HI>) comes, he first goes to the <HI>Caddee,</HI> and shews him the Imperial Mandat.

Water wherewith it perpetually stagnates, yields no benefit, but great nuisance to the neighbouring Inha∣bitants: Yet is it like to continue still a Fenny Marsh, so long as the Tyrannous Government of the Country gives so small Encourage∣ment to the improvement of Lands. The Mariners that sail by that Coast are the better for't, to whom it affords fresh Water enough to furnish a whole Fleet, in four streams that issuing from this Fen, disembogue themselves into the Sea, some six Miles distant from the Fen: Yet the Coast is so open, that no Vessel can ride there but when the Wind is in the North.</P>

Payment injuriously exacted. And such is the Corruption of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Court, that the event of an Ap∣peal would be as uncertain as the attempt unsafe.</P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Aga</HI> demands as his due, all the Butter he finds among the Inhabitants, what day soever he pitches upon to number their Flocks, in order to the gathering this <HI>Vacouf</HI> Money; which grie∣vance arose by the inconsiderate bounty of a rich <HI>Samian,</HI> who to ingratiate with the <HI>Aga,</HI> presented him with a great quantity of But∣ter, since which time, the <HI>Aga</HI> has ever claim'd it as his due from all others.</P>

<P>And now it is no wonder if this oppression by the <HI>Turkish</HI> Officers

keep the Inhabitants poor, ignorant, and low spirited. <HI>Kilitch-Aly-Basha,</HI> at his first coming to re-people the Island, brought none with him but men of low Fortunes, and the Tyranny they live under doth still keep them so. And the Malice of many slothful, but servile people among them, doth render it impossi∣ble for any person well affected to the Publick good, to effect any thing toward their Liberty, or redress of Grievances. For there wants not among the <HI>Greeks</HI> perpetual spies, that for their private ends, bring intelligence to the <HI>Aga</HI>'s Ministers of any motion made, or any word freely spoken towards the redress of Grievances. The <HI>Aga</HI>'s princi∣pal Engins are either those of his Family, (call'd <HI>Musifarides</HI>) or such creatures as lie dispers'd throughout the Island.

They are more zealous and forward to pay their Homage to a Turkish <HI>Aga</HI>'s House, than to serve Almighty God in his publick Worship; and as if Interest and Gain were their God∣liness, they are more punctually careful to devote their time to a servile attendance in the outmost Gate of the <HI>Aga,</HI> among his Por∣ters and meaner Servants, than in the solemn assembly of their fellow <HI>Christians</HI> in the Church of God. In so much, that though they are <HI>Christians</HI> by profession, yet on the most solemn days of publick De∣votion, their greatest Religion is to wait at the <HI>Aga</HI>'s House, to bid him good morrow, when he goes out to attend his pleasure, to drink Coffee, and smoak Tobacco among his Servants, and to speak nothing but what may flatter his Pride, or serve his Avarice. There is no

<P><HI>Samos</HI> is not inferiour to any Island of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> for good Soil.

They are well stor'd with Trees of all sorts, with Pitch, Cot∣tons, Corn, Oyl, Honey, and Wine, of whose Lees they make abundance of <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> by them call'd <HI>Asynchoretos,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: For when<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>un∣forgiven.</HI></NOTE> they make their <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> all Pas∣sengers are invited to tast of it, which he that refuses, is branded with the name of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in these words, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; <HI>If you will take none, you shall never obtain pardon.</HI></P>
<P>All the People of the Country are Labourers, excepting the <HI>Musa∣farides,</HI> who farm out their Lands, and make it their business to attend
<PB N="31" REF="26"/>
the <HI>Aga.</HI> Every Master of a Fa∣mily is oblig'd to attend the <HI>Aga</HI> at such time as he puts all his Corn in a readiness to be measur'd. And then is one of the <HI>Musafarides</HI> sent, who is to be entertain'd at the charge of the Master of the Family, but instead of taking a Tenth of the Corn, which is strictly his due; he takes Money according to his own valuation of the price of Corn.</P>
<P>All Wines, <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and Oyl, are Tith'd according to an ancient rate set down in the Court Rolls.</P>
<P>Heretofore there was no Imposi∣tion taken upon Silks, because it was a Manufacture exercis'd only by the hands of Women, 'till a cer∣tain <HI>Aga</HI> came, that desir'd a little to make him a Girdle; and being presented with a good handsome Basket full: The next year he de∣manded the like quantity every where as his due.</P>
<P>The Habit of the <HI>Samians</HI> is like the <HI>Turks:</HI> A long Vest, like our Cassock, down to the Heels with a Girdle about the Loins, and over

it a loose Garment, like a Batche∣lour of Arts Gown. The Women likewise imitate the <HI>Turkish</HI> Women in their Apparel, girded about the Loins, a white Vail over their Heads. The young Women let their hair hang down behind, in a long Look plaited, and ty'd at the end with a Silver or Guilt Chain.</P>
<P>In former times, the greatest part of the Isles of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> were under the Jurisdiction of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Rhodes;</HI> and this Isle had a Bishop that was Suffragan to that Arch-Bishop. But since the last re-peopling of the Isle, it has been under the Patriarch of <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI> who bestow'd it upon the great Church of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and sent a Vicar to collect all the Ecclesiasti∣cal Revenues. And in this condi∣tion it continu'd for an hundred years, 'till the People of the Isle did petition the Patriarch to let them have an Arch-Bishop, which accordingly he did, and appointed them the Bishop of <HI>Nicaria</HI> for their Suffragan; but that Island being too
<PB N="33" REF="27"/>
poor to maintain a Bishop at this day the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Samos</HI> has now no Suffragan at all.</P>
<P>When a new Arch-Bishop comes, he shews his Patent from the Grand Signior to the <HI>Caddee;</HI> then sum∣mons all the <HI>Proesti</HI> of the Villages, to whom having read his Patent, he has it Register'd in the publick Records of the Island. This done, they all accompany him to the Ca∣thedral Church, where after the Reading of his Institutions, given by the Patriarch, he is plac'd in the Archiepiscopal Throne, where eve∣ry one comes to kiss his Hand, and he bestows upon them his Bene∣diction; and then makes them a Speech (if he find himself of suffi∣cient capacity to do't.) This is the way of his Investiture into the Arch-Bishoprick of <HI>Samos</HI> and <HI>Ni∣caria.</HI></P>
<P>At his first coming, the <HI>Papas,</HI> or Parish Priest of the Church of his Residence presents him 15, or 20 Dollers; they of the other Chur∣ches according to their Abilities.
<PB N="34" REF="28"/>
The first year of his coming, every Parish Priest pays him 4 Dollers, and the following years 2. Every Lay-man pays him 48 Aspers, and the following years 24. The rest of his Revenues comes in by Or∣dinations and Marriages. One part of the Island come to <HI>Megale Chore,</HI> where he Resides, for Li∣censes to Marry, the other part to his Vicar General at <HI>Carlovasi.</HI> The <HI>Samians</HI> pay one Doller for a License; all Strangers two: But he that comes after first Marriage for a License for a second, or third, pays three or four. Since <HI>Samos</HI> has been an Arch-Bishoprick, there has been hitherto but eight; 1. <HI>Athanasius;</HI> 2. <HI>Anthimus;</HI> 3. <HI>Parthenius;</HI> 4. <HI>Cor∣nelius;</HI> 5. <HI>Christophorus;</HI> 6. <HI>Neophy∣tus;</HI> 7. <HI>Joseph</HI> (who writ this Hi∣story in vulgar <HI>Greek</HI>) and <HI>Philaretus</HI> that now succeeds him. Of whom here is a short account.</P>
<P><HI>Athanasius,</HI> a Native of the Isle, and a Marry'd Priest, but his Wife dying about the time of his pro∣motion, took upon him the Ha∣bit

of a <HI>Caloir,</HI> he was Arch-Bi∣shop 20 years,</P>
<P><HI>Anthimus,</HI> surnam'd <HI>Judas,</HI> be∣cause at the Ceremony of the Pa∣triarch's washing the Feet of twelve Priests on <HI>Maunday Thursday▪</HI> he being one, had the name of <HI>Judas.</HI> The Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> in imitation of our Saviour, doth eve∣ry year, on <HI>Maunday Thursday,</HI> Wash the Feet of twelve Men in Holy Orders, who are at that time cal∣led the twelve Apostles; and every Priest hath at that time the name of some particular Apostle. After he had been Arch-Bishop 15 years, upon a Complaint made against him by the Islanders to the <HI>Capitan Basha,</HI> or Admiral of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleet, he was clapt into prison, whence being releas'd by a sum of Money, he became afterwards Arch-Bishop of <HI>Caesarea</HI> in <HI>Cappadocia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Parthenius</HI> a <HI>Theban,</HI> was Tran∣slated from the Arch-Bishoprick of <HI>Patras</HI> to <HI>Samos,</HI> where he presided 12 years, only under the Title of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or President; but after
<PB N="36" REF="29"/>
he had passed 12 years under this meaner and unusual Title, he was admitted to the full Rights and Dig∣nity of an Arch-Bishop.</P>
<P><HI>Cornelius</HI> of <HI>Metelyne</HI> was depo∣sed by the Patriarch of <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI> after he had sat six years.</P>
<P><HI>Christophorus</HI> a <HI>Samian,</HI> was clapt into the Galleys by the <HI>Venetian</HI> Admiral, for not paying Contribu∣tion to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> at the ap∣pointed time; for hapning to be Arch-Bishop in the beginning of that War between the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Venetians</HI> (so calamitous to all the <HI>Greek</HI> Isles) the <HI>Venetians</HI> then Ma∣sters at Sea, forc'd all the <HI>Archipelago</HI> to contribution. He to secure his poor flock, the <HI>Samians,</HI> from im∣mediate Plunder, Rapine, Cap∣tivity, and other Insolencies, did engage for raising the demanded Contribution, which was an high sum for that place, but was not able to make good his promise with∣in the appointed time; because of the Peoples poverty: Whereupon the <HI>Venetian</HI> Admiral, without any
<PB REF="29"/>
respect to his Religion as a <HI>Christian,</HI> or to his place and quality as an Arch-Bishop, did most Barbarously put him into the Gallies, a punish∣ment commonly imposed upon <HI>Tur∣kish</HI> Captives, or such <HI>Christians</HI> on∣ly as were gross and notorious Ma∣lefactours, and judicially con∣demn'd for capital Crimes.</P>
<P><HI>Neophytus</HI> of <HI>Siphanto</HI> sat 6 years, and deceased in the Island.</P>
<P>After him came <HI>Josph Georgirene,</HI> of the Island of <HI>Milos,</HI> who was Consecrated, <HI>October</HI> 7. 1666. He sat here five years, till after the ta∣king of <HI>Candie,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> grew more populous, and consequently more abusive: So that wearied with their injuries, he retired to the Holy <HI>Grotto</HI> of the <HI>Apocalypse,</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Patmos.</HI></P>
<P>After he had voluntarily retir'd from his Arch-Bishoprick, the Pa∣triarch of <HI>Constantinople</HI> did pre∣sently substitute in his place <HI>Philare∣tus</HI> of the Isle of <HI>Siphanto.</HI></P>
<P>And thus much concerning the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Samos,</HI> his Inve∣stiture
<PB REF="30"/>
his Jurisdiction, and his Revenue. Proceed we to the Cler∣gy, that under him have the Cure of Souls. And these not only in <HI>Samos,</HI> but throughout the whole extent of the whole <HI>Greek</HI> Church, are always dignifi'd and distin∣guish'd by the peculiar title of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Papas</HI> which signifies a Fa∣ther, because in spiritual matters within the bounds of their Cure, they are Fathers, as well to Feed as to Govern.</P>
<P>The <HI>Papas</HI> in the bounds of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">(a) Of those whom the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <HI>Papas,</HI> or Parochi∣al Priests.</NOTE> Parish is oblig'd to perform all those sacred Offices which the <HI>Greek</HI> Ri∣tual requires. They are not only allow'd to Marry, but oblig'd to do't, before they enter into the Order of Priest-hood. And not only those <HI>Greek</HI> Priests that live under the Patriarch of <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI> but also those <HI>Greeks</HI> that in <HI>Sicily, Calabria,</HI> and in the Islands under the State of <HI>Venice</HI> do em∣brace the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, are by allowance of the Pope permitted to Marry. And such Men (though
<PB N="39" REF="30"/>
Marry'd) are commonly Ordained Priests at <HI>Rome</HI> it self, by some <HI>Greek</HI> Bishop of the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion in the College of <HI>Greeks</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and in that of <HI>Spain,</HI> and in that called <HI>Madonna del Populo:</HI> Yet the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, for that esteem they have of a Monastick Life, do never ad∣vance a Parish Priest to a Bishoprick, except his Wife be Dead, or Di∣vorc'd from him, and he take up∣on him the Habit and Profession of a <HI>Caloir.</HI></P>
<P>A Marry'd Man, that would take Orders, is required to declare, that he has been but once Marry'd, and that his Wife was neither a Widow, nor a Slave, nor the Daughter of a Slave, or under the reproach of an Harlot: This done, he comes to a Confessour, who among other Sins, doth particularly put him upon the Confession of those Sins that by the Canon would exclude him from entring into Orders. And though his Confessour give him a good Testimony, yet a Week be∣fore the Ordination, the Bishop
<PB N="40" REF="31"/>
doth openly in the Church charge all the Assembly under the Peril of Excommunication, if they know him guilty of any Crime that may render him unworthy of Holy Or∣ders, to reveal it before the next Sunday: Which if any Man do, and make good his Accusation, he is denied Holy Orders; if the Ac∣cuser be found to Impeach him false∣ly, he is Excommunicated for his false Accusation, and the other Ordain'd. After the <HI>Candidate</HI> for Holy Orders has thus made his way, the day before he enters into Priests Orders, he comes to the Metropo∣lite, who having try'd whether he Read and Write without false Pronuntiation, or mis-spelling; and being satisfied in that point, doth presently Ordain him Sub-dea∣con and Deacon, and the next day Priest, if he be of sufficient Age. The Age for a Reader is 18; For a Sub-Deacon, 20; For a Deacon, 25. For a Priest, 30; Nevertheless it is left to the Discretion of the Metro∣polite, to dispense with the Canon,
<PB N="41" REF="31"/>
as he shall see occasion, according to the example of <HI>Anicetus,</HI> who Ordained St. <HI>Eleutherius</HI> a Priest at 18, and Bishop of <HI>Illyrium</HI> at 20. If a <HI>Papas</HI> Marry a second time, he is deprived of his Orders, and cal∣led ever after <HI>Apopapas.</HI> But no∣thing hinders the Widow of a Priest to Marry again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Papas</HI> is obliged to Read Prayers, and Administer the Sa∣crament every Sunday and Holy∣day. The day before a Sacrament, he is to sing the Vespers, and after Supper, to rehearse a Prayer call'd the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; if after that Prayer said, he chance to Eat or Drink that Night, he is oblig'd to go to Church, and say that Prayer again: Likewise that Night he is not al∣low'd to lye with his Wife.</P>
<P>Every Parishioner is obliged to bring to Church a Loaf to the Weight of seven or eight pounds, which is mark'd with these three words; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: <HI>Jesus Christ overcomes.</HI> Of this Bread the Priest distributes to every one a
<PB N="42" REF="32"/>
Morsel, and the rest goes to him∣self.</P>
<P>If any man desire the Sacrament upon other days than Sundays or Holidays, he sends to the Priest the day before, to prepare himself according to the Canon. The next Morning the Priest sends to him to bring with him what is necessary for Celebration, <HI>viz.</HI> a Loaf, mar∣ked as before, a Wax Taper of two Aspers, and Incense of one Asper, (for they never Celebrate without a lighted Taper, and In∣cense) and a Quart of Wine, and three Aspers in Money: What is left of the Bread and Wine, goes to the Priest with three Aspers. He that leaves it to the Priest to pro∣vide necessaries, brings with him 15 Aspers.</P>
<P>The Parish Priests, excepting those that are very ancient, or Widowers, never confess any. That employment is left ordinarily to the <HI>Caloirs</HI> of the Order of St. <HI>Basil,</HI> whereof there wants not some every where dispersed throughout
<PB N="43" REF="32"/>
the whole <HI>Greek</HI> Church, to beg Almes for the Monks of <HI>Athos,</HI> from whence they are sent. Yet neither they, nor any Parish Priest confess any without a particular License from the Metropolite, who doth enjoyn them under a Mortal Sin, not to exact any Money for Absolu∣tion. But if after Absolution, the Penitent offer any thing, they re∣ceive it. If the Penitent desires any Prayers to be said for him in some Monastry of Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> he gives Money in consideration of the Prayers to be said for him.</P>
<P>If the Parish Priest have any Lands, he thinks it no shame to Till them himself. But he resides con∣stantly in the Parish, to be ready up∣on all occasions for the Sick, to whom he says the Prayers appoin∣ted by the Church for Sick people.</P>
<P>If a Woman be in Child-birth, he is sent for to say some Prayers appointed for that occasion; nor can the company that come to as∣sist the Woman in her Travail leave the House, 'till the Priest come and
<PB N="44" REF="33"/>
perform the Sacred Ceremonies ap∣pointed by the Church, for Women in Child-bed; accounting it a great contempt of God, and a thing ominous and of ill foreboding to the success of the person in Labour, to neglect their solemn address to God in the prayers appointed by publick Authority for that Emer∣gency.</P>
<P>A Woman <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Of their Women in Child-bed.</NOTE> after Child-birth stirs not abroad, neither to Church, nor to other Houses, till 40 days be expir'd. Then she is brought to the Church Door, where the Priest having said the Prayers appointed for that occasion, she is permitted to go to Church, or to other Hou∣ses.</P>
<P>The Children ordinarily are not <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Paedo∣baptism.</NOTE> Baptiz'd till 40 days after Birth, sometimes, under pretence of the Parents or Gossips absence, not till half a Year, a whole Year, or more. But this is alwayes in case the Child be healthy and strong; for upon the least suspition of the Childs being weak, or likely to dye, the
<PB N="45" REF="33"/>
Priest is sent for by the Parents, and without any further Ceremony, the Child is Baptized in this man∣ner.</P>
<P>N. N. <HI>The servant of God doth Baptize thee, in the Name of the Father,</HI> Amen. <HI>Of the Son,</HI> Amen. <HI>And of the Holy Ghost, from henceforth and for ever∣more,</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>In private Baptism they use only Water, Oyl, and a Lamp burning before the Picture of the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> For there is no House so poor, which has not the Picture of the Blessed Virgin, or some other Saint, before which they pray, Mor∣ning and Night, after they have lighted a Lamp.</P>
<P>In publick Baptism, the Child is brought to the Church Porch, where after the Priest has said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Exorcism, the Child is brought to the Font, and being interrogated by the Priest, the God-father makes answer, and rehearseth the Creed thrice. Then the Priest Conse∣crates the Water, which being hot
<PB N="46" REF="34"/>
he pours into't Oil Olive, and Anoints the Child on several parts of the Body. The Child is Anoin∣ted on the Forehead, Mouth, Ears, Breast, Hands, Knees, and Feet with these words at every place; <HI>The Seal of the Gift of the Holy Spirit.</HI> Then the God-father claps a Cross to the Childs Breast: This done, the Priest takes the Child stark naked, and baths him all over thrice in the Water, saying the same words as you had in private Bap∣tism. After the third Bathing, he pours some of the Water upon the Child's Head: Then delivering the Child into the hands of the God-Fathers, he puts a Shirt on the Child, with these words; <HI>Jesus Christ our merciful God, cloathed with Light, give thee a bright Garment.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Greeks</HI> of the Island that (<HI>b</HI>) Marry, first obtain a License of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> the Arch-Bishop, or his Grand Vi∣car: Then the Priest having exa∣mined if they have any Legal pro∣hibition of affinity, or otherwise; either at the Church, or their own
<PB N="47" REF="34"/>
Houses, Marrys them in this man∣ner. After the Reading of that part of the Liturgy which con∣cerns Marriage, and the parties enterchanging a Ring, the Priest takes two Garlands made like Crowns, and signing them with the sign of the Cross, he puts one on the Bridegrooms Head, with these words:</P>
<P><HI>The Servant of God</HI> N. N. <HI>is Crown'd to the Servant of God</HI> A. A. <HI>in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, henceforth and for ever.</HI></P>
<P>The like is done to the Bride, and then the Epistle and Gospel appoin∣ted for the Occasion is Read. Then he that gives them in Marriage, first Kisses the Garlands, and all the Company, in Testimony of their wishing Joy to the Married Parties.</P>
<P>On <HI>Maunday Thursday,</HI> which is an high day with the <HI>Greeks,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sacra∣ment for the Sick▪</NOTE> they Consecrate Bread, and pour upon it consecrated Wine, with these words:</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="35"/><HI>The Vnion and Conformation of the Holy Body, and Precious Blood,</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>This Bread is laid up till the first Sunday after <HI>Easter,</HI> and then the Priest in all his Formalities, ligh∣ting all the Lamps of the Altar, perfumes the Bread with Incense, and cuts it into pieces as small as a Grain of Wheat. Then being put up in a certain Vessel, it is laid up for all occasions of the Sick for that year. When any is Sick, he takes one of these Grains of Bread, and putting it into the Chalice, he carries it in his hand to the Sick Man's House: All that meet him by the way, go back with him to the sick Man's House: But at <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> and other Cities where the <HI>Turks</HI> are numerous, the Priest carries it secretly under his Arm, for fear of some affront.</P>
<P>The Priest is oblig'd to carry this Sacrament to those that have the Plague, in which case, he puts the Grain of Bread into a Raison, and gives it him at the end of a long Cane.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="35"/>When any person <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Burial of the dead;</NOTE> dyes, a Lamp is lighted over the Corps, and the House is perfum'd with Incense. Then the Corps being stript, they dip a Sponge or Lint in warm Wa∣ter, and draw it over the Face, Knees, and Feet, in form of a Cross: Then taking a white Lin∣nen Cloth, they make a Hole in the middle, large enough for the Head to come out, and sewing it up close at the Feet, they cloath him again with the best Garments the Party Deceased had. When the Corps are ready to go to Church, the Priest goes before the Corps with a Cross and a Taper in his hand, singing certain Prayers. At the Church, the Office for the Dead being ended, the Friends and Kindred of the Party Deceased, come and kiss the Corps. The Corps being brought to the Grave, the Priest takes some of the Earth, and sprinkling upon the Head, and the Feet, and the two Sides, in form of a Cross, saying these words:</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="36"/><HI>The Earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof; Take O Earth, that which is form'd of thee by the hand of God, who hath received that which was made according to his likeness, and do thou take the Body which belongs to thee.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Priest throws upon the Corps some Water, or Oyl, out of one of the Church-Lamps, and a piece of flaming Incense, and so the Corps are covered. In <HI>Samos</HI> they give Bread and Wine at the Church, to those that accom∣pany the Corps to Church.</P>
<P>Three days after Interment, the Friends of the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Com∣memorati∣on for the Dead.</NOTE> Deceased have a solemn Office at the Church for the Dead. After the Office is ended, they have a sort of small Junket, which they distribute, and Eat in the Church, with Wine, or Strong Water, to wash it down. This sort of Junket they call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Colyba,</HI> and they derive its first Institution from the time of <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, who to
<PB N="51" REF="36"/>
spite the <HI>Christians,</HI> commanded all the Bakers to raise their Paste with the Blood of Beasts that were Sacrific'd to Idols. The <HI>Christians,</HI> ignorant of the com∣mand, were about to buy the Bread, till St. <HI>Theron,</HI> that was a Martyr under <HI>Maximin,</HI> appearing to the Patriarch <HI>Eudoxius,</HI> admo∣nish'd him to forbid the <HI>Greeks</HI> to Eat any Bread of the Bakers ma∣king, because it was mix'd with the Blood of Beasts offer'd to Idols. The Patriarch then ask'd the Saint what the People should Eat. He told them <HI>Colyba,</HI> and so shew'd him the way how to make it. But now the <HI>Greeks</HI> use it at these Funeral Commemorations, and on a <HI>Shrove-Sunday;</HI> and the Sunday before <HI>Pentecost.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover they have another Commemoration for the Dead, nine dayes after Burial, at the House where the Party dy'd. Then a∣gain forty days; then at the end of three Months; then of six Months; then of nine Months,
<PB N="52" REF="37"/>
and at last of twelve Months. The first Year of the party Deceased being expired, the Commemora∣tion is only Annual.</P>
<P>Every Parish hath an anniver∣sary Feast, in Commemoration of that peculiar Saint or Patron, to whose memory that Church is De∣dicated, and by whose name it is called. All they of the Parish, and others that have a particular devo∣tion for the Saint, carry with them a present of Bread, of a Wax-Taper and Frankincense. The Bread goes to the Arch-Bishops Vicar General; the Tapers and Incense to the service of the Church.</P>
<P>And now we have finished the Description of <HI>Samos,</HI> and the story of its present State and Con∣dition, by which one place being one of the largest of the <HI>Archi∣pelago</HI> for Circumference, and one of the Fruitfullest for Soil, We may guess at the condition of all the rest that are rich enough to maintain a Turkish Governour.

But they are given to a Credulity of new reports more inconvenient than that of old Fables, and that the belief of Treasures hid in all old Ruins ever since the taking of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where so much was found long after it was burn'd. This conceit blown up by various reports; and the Itch of talking on one side, and the great creduli∣ty of ignorant People on the other, hath encreased into a vulgar Tra∣dition, very incommodious to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and whereat the <HI>Turks</HI> take great advantage against them, in case they meddle with any Ruins, either for Curiosity or Use. And these Islanders have a common Tradition, that about this old Tower of <HI>Icarus</HI> lyes a great treasure, whereof part, though not all, they say, was carri'd away some 40 years ago, by some <HI>Asiaticks,</HI> that came over by stealth, and in the Night, dug up all the ground; And an old Man, whom I spoke with, that saw them at work, but durst not come neer
<PB N="58" REF="40"/>
till they had all gone aboard, and set Sail, upon his approach, found the dead Carkase of a Man newly slain; whom they suppose was sacrific'd to the Genius of the place, or the Guardian Angel of the Trea∣sure. They add besides, that be∣fore this adventure of the <HI>Asiaticks,</HI> the place was haunted with a Spirit, which alwaies appear'd in black, and destroy'd their Oxen, at least one in a year. But since that time, the place was no more haunted, nor did the Labourers ever complain of the loss of an Ox.</P>
<P>About this Shore are the best Cockles of all the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> The principal Villages are 1. <HI>Ca∣choria,</HI> of 100 Houses, and two or three <HI>Ches.</HI> 2. <HI>Steli,</HI> famous for great abundance of Nut-Trees. 3. <HI>Musara,</HI> besides which is an Hermitage, and a Church, where∣in are kept the Reliques of St. <HI>The∣octistes,</HI> who was of <HI>Lesbos,</HI> and whom the People do think yet does Miracles at this day. Here are in the Isle, the Ruins of a greater
<PB N="59" REF="40"/>
Town than any now is. The Church is yet standing, and goes by the name of St. <HI>Hellens.</HI> The Beauty of its Fabrick, is a clear ar∣gument, it was built in the days of the <HI>Constantinopolitan</HI> Emperours; and though it has no House neer hand it, yet great resort is made hither for Devotion; and from time to time there never wants a <HI>Papas</HI> to say the Prayers of the Church in it.</P>
<P>There are besides these three al∣ready nam'd, a great many little Villages scatter'd up and down through the whole Island, which for the number of Houses, are lar∣ger of extent than those in <HI>Samos;</HI> for here every House is environ'd with its proper Garden, Orchard; but the Houses in <HI>Samos</HI> are com∣monly built closer, and their Gar∣dens, and Orchards at a greater distance.</P>
<P>The whole Island is for the most part Mountainous, and Rocky. The Valleys are few, and little in compass; so that with great labour,
<PB N="60" REF="41"/>
and difficulty, they force out of so barren a Soil, that little Corn they have; which is not sufficient to feed the Inhabitants above one half the year; and lays a necessity upon the <HI>Nicarians</HI> to traffick abroad for supplies elsewhere. But principally they trade to <HI>Scio</HI> for Corn, whither they carry Wood from <HI>Samos,</HI> and the neighbouring parts of <HI>Natolia.</HI> They are very expert in making Boats, and small Vessels, which are in such esteem, that they are bought up by all their Neighbours. Besides their Traf∣fick in Wood and small Vessels, they vend good store of Sheep and Goats, wherewith their Moun∣tains are well stor'd. And yet their care to keep them is so small, that without either milking them, or driving them into Coats, or Folds, or making any limits or bounds, they only visit them twice a Year, to count the number of their Flocks, and to imprint the Marks of the proper Owners. Some there are, and those of the
<PB N="61" REF="41"/>
Richest, that are at the trouble of milking so many, as may supply their Family with Cheese. They vend likewise good store of Swines Flesh. Wax, and Honey they have great plenty of, but their Honey is in no great esteem, because of that bitterness of taste which it receives from their Bees feeding up∣on Firr leaves, which Tree that Island abounds with.</P>
<P>The most commendable thing of this Island is their Air and Water, both so healthful, that the People are very long liv'd, it being an ordinary thing to see persons in it of an 100 years of Age, which is a great wonder, considering how hardily they live. There is not a Bed in the Island, the Ground is their Tick, and the cold Stone their Pillow, and the Cloaths they wear is all the Coverlet they use. They provide no more Apparel than what they wear all at once, when that is past wearing any lon∣ger, then think of a new Suit. Betwixt their ordinary times of
<PB N="62" REF="42"/>
Eating, there is not a piece of Bread to be found in the Isle. A little before Dinner, they take as much Corn as will serve that Meal, grind it with a Hand-Mill, bake it upon a flat Stone; when 'tis Bak'd, the Master of the Fa∣mily divides it equally among the Family; but a Woman with child has two shares. If any Stranger comes in, every one parts with a Piece of his own share to accom∣modate the Stranger. Their Wine is always made with a third part Water, and so very weak and small. When they drink it, so much as is thought sufficient is put into one large Bowl, and so passes round. The <HI>Nicarians</HI> are the only Islanders of all the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> that nei∣ther keep Wine to sell, nor lay it up in Wooden Vessels, but in long Jars, cover'd all over in the Ground. When they have a mind to Tap it, they make a Bung-hole in the top, and draw it out with Canes. Their Houses are so plain, that all the Furniture you can see is an
<PB N="63" REF="42"/>
Hand-Mill, besides this, there is nothing but bare Walls: That little they have besides is all hid under Ground; not so much for fear of the <HI>Corsairs</HI> (from whom their Po∣verty is a sure guard) as out of Cu∣stome. Nor are they all so poor, as not to be able to buy Beds, but custom has brought them into a contempt of Beds, as meerly super∣fluous; insomuch, that when they Travel into other Islands, they refuse the offer of a Bed. A Priest of <HI>Nicaria</HI> coming into <HI>Samos,</HI> was courteously entertain'd by those of his Order, and at Night was of∣fer'd a Bed to lye in; he thank'd them, but refus'd, nor could by any importunity be prevail'd upon, but told them the Earth was his Mother, from whence he would not keep a distance; besides he was afraid of being Sick, if he should lye in a Bed; and therefore if they had a kindness for him, they must give him the liberty of sleeping after his own Country way.</P>
<P>When I went to visit them as
<PB N="64" REF="43"/>
Arch-Bishop, and ignorant of the custom of the Country, carry'd no Bed. At Night, where I first lodg'd, asking for a Chamber, they told me they had no other than that where I first came; then asking for a Bed, they told me it was not the Custom of the Country; then de∣siring to borrow some Bed Cloaths for Love or Money, all they brought me was one Smock made of course Dimity.</P>
<P>They have no great communi∣cation one with another, any far∣ther than the publick times of Sa∣cred Solemnities, or Civil Business doth cause them to come together. At other times they keep strictly within the narrow Sphere of their own affairs. Formal Visits, Treats, and Entertainments, are things un∣known. If any business do put them upon a Visit to their Neigh∣bour, they come not close to his Door, but stand off at a great di∣stance, and call aloud to him; If he make them answer, they dis∣course the Business they came about,
<PB N="65" REF="43"/>
standing off at the same distance; except they be earnestly invited to come in. And this way of dis∣coursing at a distance they practice more in the Fields and Mountains; their Voices being so strong, that 'tis ordinary to talk at a Miles di∣stance; sometimes at four or five, where the Valleys interpos'd be∣tween two hills, give advantage to the Voice. Sometimes they can discourse at that distance, that the carriage of the Sound through the Winding of the Valleys, shall re∣quire half a Quarter of an Hours time; and yet they make distinct, and proper Answers, both audible and intelligible, without the help of a <HI>Stentorophonical</HI> Trumpet.</P>
<P>Their Habit for the Men, is a Shirt, and over it a short Cassock, down to the Knees, to which, in Winter they add only a short Vest, that reaches a little below the mid∣dle. Stockings they never wear. There Shoes are only a piece of thin Copper, bow'd to the shape of their Feet, and every one is his
<PB N="66" REF="44"/>
own Shoe-maker. The Women have nothing but one Smock, but so large, that they wrap it double, or treble down to the Girdle, but below the Girdle single. The Priests, for greater reverence in the Church, ty two Towels about their Legs, the one is their usual Bonnet, and the other their Girdle: so that they perform sacred Offices un∣guirt, as well as uncover'd.</P>
<P>Of all the Isles of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> this only admits of no mixture with strangers in Marriage, nor admits any stranger to settle with them: They being, as they pretend, all de∣scended of the Imperial Blood of the <HI>Porphyrogenneti,</HI> must not stain their noble Blood with inferiour Matches, or mixtures with <HI>Choriats,</HI> or Peasants, for so they term all the other Islanders.</P>
<P><HI>Porphyrogenneti,</HI> were those of the Blood Royal, in the Days of the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperours, so call'd, from their wearing of Purple, which was a Badge of Royalty, and allow'd only to Princes of the
<PB N="67" REF="44" MS="y"/>
Blood; and not from an house call'd <HI>Porphyra,</HI> where the Empresses were wont to <HI>lie in.</HI> But Purple was throughout the East, the known Badge of Royalty. Hence came that unsanctify'd Wit, and learned'st Writer that ever oppos'd the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion with his Pen, to be call'd <HI>Porphyrius:</HI> For his true name in the Language of <HI>Syria,</HI> his native Country, was <HI>Malchus,</HI> or King; but the <HI>Greeks</HI> did para∣phrase it <HI>Porphyrius,</HI> or Purple∣robed; that being a Colour pecu∣liar to Kings.</P>
<P>They have a great Happiness, by reason of their poverty, in not being molested by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who think it not worth their while to come among them, nor if they should, were they likely to enjoy any quiet, without keeping a stron∣ger Guard than the Revenues of the Isle would maintain. Once they slew a <HI>Caddee,</HI> sent by the Grand Signior, and being summon'd to Answer for their Crime, they by common consent own'd the Fact,
<PB N="68" REF="45"/>
but would name no particular Man. So that the <HI>Turkish</HI> Officers looking upon their beggerly Cloaths, thought there was neither gain nor glory in punishing such Miscreants, and that in Justice, they must pu∣nish all, or none, dismiss'd them untouch'd. From that time no <HI>Turk</HI> ever troubled them: For they take all courses imaginable to seem poor; and wheresoever they come abroad, they count it no shame to beg Alms: Yet they make a shift every year to levy 300 Crowns for the Arch-Bishop. They are go∣vern'd by a <HI>Proesti</HI> of their own chusing, who also levys their Ha∣ratch or Tribute to the Grand Sig∣nior, and takes care to carry it to the <HI>Aga</HI> of <HI>Scio.</HI> As for their Re∣ligion, it is the same with that of <HI>Samos;</HI> but their Priests are more ignorant.</P>
<P>Thus you have an account of a small Island, the Poorest, and yet the Happiest of the whole <HI>Aegaean</HI> Sea. The Soil is Barren, but the Air is Healthful; their Wealth is
<PB N="69" REF="45"/>
but small; but their Liberty and Security is great. They are not molested with the Tyrannous In∣solence of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Officer, nor with the frightful Incursions of barbarous and merciless Pirates. Their Diet and Apparel is below the Rate of Beggars in other Coun∣trys, and their Lodging is a thing of no more care, or cost, than that of the Beasts of the Field, yet their Bodies are strong and hardy, and the People generally long liv'd. They live with as little forecast, as if they expected not to survive a Day, being contented to satisfy the present necessities of Nature. They do properly <HI>In diem vivere,</HI> or as we say, From Hand to Mouth. They have but little, yet they never Want. Their Igno∣rance is equal to their Poverty, and contributes much to their con∣tent. And how well they esteem of their own condition, their con∣tempt of their Neighbouring Islands, and scorning to mix with them in Alliance by Marriage, is
<PB N="70" REF="46"/>
a manifest sign. Whence we may learn, that they approach the nearest to Contentedness is this Life; whose desires are contracted into the narrowest compass.</P>

<DIV1 N="Patmos" TYPE="description">
<PB N="71" REF="46"/>
<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION Of the ISLE of PATMOS.</HEAD>
<P>THe Isle of <HI>Patmos,</HI> now call'd <HI>Patino,</HI> is 36 Miles in com∣pass, 40 Miles from the Continent of <HI>Asia,</HI> towards <HI>Ephesus;</HI> as many Miles distant from <HI>Samos</HI> North East of it; 30 from <HI>Nicaria,</HI> North; 60 from <HI>Paros,</HI> and <HI>Naxos,</HI> West; 60 from <HI>Amurgos,</HI> South.</P>
<P>The Figure is neither round nor square, but irregular, by reason of unequal Promontories and Bays. It is furnish'd with very commodi∣ous Havens, to which it owes its being inhabited, though not so well as in former times, as appears by the many and great Ruins in it.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="47"/>This Island was eminent for those wonderful Revelations which the Blessed Apostle, and Evangelist St. <HI>John</HI> had in it, during his banish∣ment thither in the time of the Per∣secution under <HI>Domitian.</HI> The sub∣stance of what is related in that Life of St. <HI>John,</HI> that goes under the Name of <HI>Prochorus,</HI> is generally believ'd in <HI>Patmos</HI> to this day. And though the Author might be of later years than <HI>Prochorus,</HI> the Disci∣ple of St. <HI>John,</HI> as the most judi∣cious Historians of later days do pronounce him to be: Yet that the whole contents of that Book should be a meer Fable, and nothing but the Product of the Authors invention and fancy, is very impro∣bable. For though he might take great liberty in the Manner and Cir∣cumstance of what he relates, yet the Matter and Substance were built upon some foundations of real Truth, and such as many Books now not extant, and the Streams of Tradition then nearer the Foun∣tain, but now run dry, might ac∣quaint
<PB N="73" REF="47"/>
him with. That the Island, at St. <HI>John</HI>'s first coming were all Idolaters, had people possessed with Devils, and were mis-led with Ma∣gicians, is more than probable. That St. <HI>John</HI>'s casting a Devil out of young <HI>Apollonides,</HI> had a great influence on the peoples Conversion, and rais'd him the Enmity of a Magician, and all that he could draw after him, is a thing reasona∣bly credible. The Name of <HI>Cynops</HI> the Magitian, is known to all the People to this day; yea, not with∣out some very improbable circum∣stances of the Story, that St. <HI>John</HI> should cause him to jump twice in∣to the Sea, and the second time to be turn'd into a Rock, which now bears his name. However it is no small credit to a Place, otherwise very inconsiderable, that that great Apostle, once the peculiarly belo∣ved Disciple; who of all the Apo∣stles, did alone survive our Savi∣ours judicial coming into his King∣dom of Power and Vengeance up∣on the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation: that he
<PB N="74" REF="48"/>
should be for no small time an In∣habitant of this Island, and there Pen that Mysterious and Sublime Book, which to him indeed was <HI>Apocalypse,</HI> but to all others <HI>Apo∣crypha,</HI> to him a Revelation, but to us yet an hidden Mystery: like the former Prophecies of the Old Testament, that were never right∣ly understood till actually fulfill'd. The Tradition of this Island is ve∣ry positive, that he writ his Gospel here likewise, and that upon the Request of the Islanders, who at his departure, after seven years abode in the Island, did importune him to leave them in writing what they ought to believe: Whereupon he staid eight days longer, to dictate the Gospel to his Disciples that writ it.</P>
<P>They add more, that as he was beginning the Work, there hap∣ned a great Thunder and Earth∣quake, whereupon, looking up to Heaven, he spake those words; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: <HI>In the beginning was the Word.</HI> Besides, it is a most
<PB N="75" REF="48"/>
confirm'd Tradition, that the Ca∣vern, which now goes by the name of the Holy <HI>Grotto,</HI> was made by the Rupture of the Earth, in that Earthquake.</P>
<P>The Original of this Island, as it is at this day, is ascribed to St. <HI>Christodoulus,</HI> in the Days of <HI>Alexius Comnenus.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>Alexius Comnenus,</HI> the first of that name, in whose dayes be∣gan the Holy War, who reigned the 20 last years of the tenth Cen∣tury, and the 18 first of the ele∣venth, and was contemporary with <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, and <HI>God∣frey</HI> of <HI>Bulloigne.</HI> This <HI>Christodou∣lus</HI> was Abbot of <HI>Latros,</HI> and had jurisdiction over some 20 Monaste∣ries in <HI>Asia,</HI> near a great Lake about a days Journey and half from <HI>Ephesus.</HI> He being molested by the <HI>Turks,</HI> (whose power now mighti∣ly encreas'd in <HI>Asia</HI>) obtained leave of the Emperour to build a Mona∣stry in <HI>Patmos:</HI> Whither having transported his Wealth and Family, he built a Monastry near the Port
<PB N="76" REF="49"/>
of <HI>Nestia,</HI> and named it <HI>Rouvali.</HI> But not liking the place, (and as the Tradition goes, being warned by a Vision, and a Voice from Hea∣ven,) he quitted that Monastry, and built another in the highest part of the Island, and fortifi'd it with a strong Castle, environ'd with high and strong Walls: And there he built a Church. The In∣habitants that lay scatter'd in the Isle, desired leave to build Huts neer the Monastry, for their better Shel∣ter, and defence, in case of any sudden Attaque by Pirats. In pro∣cess of time, these Huts were chang'd into fair Houses, and by Trade and Commerce, became a great Town, to the number of 800 Houses, and there Inhabited by rich Merchants, that traded in∣to all parts. But the many Revo∣lutions that have happen'd since, have eclips'd the former Glory of the place: And their Ships of Mer∣chandise are all dwindl'd into small Fisher Boats, and the Inhabitants are all extremely poor.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="49"/>About half a mile from this place stands the Holy <HI>Grotto,</HI> where St. <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist is said to have writ the <HI>Apocalypse.</HI> Here is a small Monastry, under the Ju∣risdiction of a <HI>Caloir.</HI> The Inhabi∣tants of the neighbouring Borough, pay great Devotion to this place. They talk here of a Fig-Tree, whose Figs have naturally the Characters of the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Apocalypsis.</HI> Near the <HI>Grotto</HI> is a stone Font, where St. <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist is said to have baptiz'd.</P>
<P>The best Port of this Island, and of all the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> on the West side towards <HI>Naxos,</HI> is call'd <HI>Scala,</HI> or the <HI>Wharf,</HI> because of a Wharf built of stone for the convenient lading or un-lading of Ships. That which renders it free from an∣noyance of Winds are certain lit∣tle Islands that shelter it from the East and North-east Winds. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet were wont to winter here during the War of <HI>Candy.</HI></P>
<P>Besides this Port, stands an entire Village, call'd <HI>Phocas,</HI> without an
<PB N="78" REF="50"/>
Inhabitant. Here is likewise a∣mong old Ruins, a Church yet stan∣ding, which they say was built in St. <HI>John</HI>'s days, and they shew some∣thing like a Pulpit, where they say St. <HI>John</HI> us'd to Preach. 2. <HI>Merike,</HI> whose neighbouring Hills are well stored with Vine-yards. 3. <HI>Leukes,</HI> fortify'd with a Ca∣stle for the Retreat of the Labou∣rers in the Vine-yards, and well supply'd with fresh Fish, from a neighbouring Lake. 4. <HI>Myrsini,</HI> from the growth of Myrtles hereabouts. Here is a Fountain of excellent Water, which the People call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Hagiasma,</HI> or <HI>Holy-Well.</HI> 5. St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> from a Church here dedicated to that Saint. 6. St. <HI>George</HI>'s from a Church here dedicated to that Saint: This is a convenient place for Ships to take in fresh, Water at. Two Miles hence are the Ruins of an old Town call'd <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Platys Gialos,</HI> or the <HI>Broad shore;</HI> but now it is co∣ver'd with the shrub <HI>Arbutus,</HI> which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <HI>Coumara,</HI> in old
<PB N="79" REF="50"/>
<HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: it bears a Fruit like a Strawberry, but much bigger. 7. <HI>Turcolimnionos,</HI> or the <HI>Turks</HI> Port, because it is frequented by the <HI>Cor∣sairs.</HI> Betwixt this place and Port <HI>Scala,</HI> a rich Merchant <HI>Nicholas Ma∣thas</HI> did lately build a Tower at <HI>Livadi;</HI> it being a convenient place for Vine-yards and Fishing. 8. <HI>A∣grio Livadi,</HI> before which lies St. <HI>Thecla</HI>'s Isle with a little Church, dedicated to that Saint. 9. Port <HI>Sapsila,</HI> before which lies a little Island, with a Church in it, de∣dicated to St. <HI>Luke.</HI> 10. Port <HI>Gri∣cou,</HI> next to <HI>Scala</HI> for commodious∣ness. The Island <HI>Tragonesi,</HI> or Isle of <HI>Goats,</HI> defends it from all Winds. 11. <HI>Diacopti,</HI> famous for Salt Pits, which belong to the <HI>Caloirs.</HI> Besides this Port, is a steep Rock of a very great height, which they call <HI>Cynops,</HI> from the Magician in St. <HI>John</HI>'s days, whom the Peo∣ple report to have lodg'd in a great Cave in this Rock; which Cave they yet believe to be haunted by Devils. For once letting down a
<PB N="80" REF="51"/>
Man into't by a Cord for curiosity▪ to see what was in the Cave, they pull'd him up dead. 12. <HI>Meloi,</HI> a Mile from Port <HI>Scala.</HI> And so we have finish'd the Circuit of the Island, in naming the Ports.</P>
<P>The Inland Villages are 1. <HI>Livadi.</HI> 2. <HI>Vagie,</HI> well beset with Vines and Figtrees. 3. <HI>Megalocampos,</HI> rich in the same Fruits, and accom∣modated with a Lake well stor'd with Fish. 4. <HI>Hagio Theophanes,</HI> from a Church there dedicated to that Saint, and built by St. <HI>Chri∣stodoulos.</HI> 5. <HI>Sazousa,</HI> close by the Sea, near to which are hot Springs of Water, that cure many Disea∣ses. The Island is well stored with Vines, Figg-Trees, Lemon and Orange Trees, and Corn sufficient for the Inhabitants, if they could keep what they have free from the Robbery of Pirats, as well <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> as <HI>Mahometan,</HI> that often pil∣lage the poor People, who have no other remedy but patience, and sometimes the pleasure of seeing them perish at Sea, that have been
<PB N="81" REF="51"/>
so injurious to a Shore. The <HI>Pat∣mians</HI> complain more of the Cru∣elty of the <HI>Christian</HI> Pirats, than of the <HI>Turks.</HI> And though the Islanders have procur'd Charters and Patents from the Pope; the King of <HI>France;</HI> from the State of <HI>Venice;</HI> from the Dukes of <HI>Tuscany;</HI> from the Grand Master of <HI>Maltha,</HI> to secure them from the Injuries of <HI>Christian Corsairs;</HI> it is so far from prevailing upon them to withhold their hands from rapine, that it does but provoke them to more fierceness. Yet these Pirats some∣times are made the visible objects of Divine Vengeance. About six years ago, the Marquess de <HI>Fleury,</HI> that carry'd away not only the Gra∣zing, but the Working Cattle▪ had got no further than <HI>Paros,</HI> 'till his Ship sunk in the Port, and he was taken Prisoner, and clapt into custody at <HI>Corfou,</HI> by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> Another that pillag'd the Monastry of <HI>Liptos,</HI> had no sooner put to Sea, but meeting with some <HI>Saiks,</HI> to which he gave earnest Chase, he
<PB N="82" REF="52"/>
run himself a Ground, and there perish'd he, and all his Company.</P>
<P>Let us now return to the State and Government of the Place. The whole Island was given by (<HI>a</HI>) <HI>Alexius</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Circiter annum Christi 1100.</NOTE> <HI>Comnenus</HI> to <HI>Christodoulus,</HI> and his successours in the Monastry, and the Islands near about, that were not inhabited. And what Culture they bestow on the little Islands, or what Cattle they put to Grazing there, becomes all a Prey to the <HI>Corsairs;</HI> so that the Revenues of this Monastry are now much di∣minish'd, and the Monks become extremely poor. And his Son <HI>Calo Johannes,</HI> gave also fourteen Villages in <HI>Candie:</HI> But the <HI>Turks</HI> left them but one small Hospital in <HI>Candie,</HI> which yields them 200 Dollars a Year, whereas their Revenues be∣fore were at least 13000. Besides the great Monastry, there is a little Nunnery, containing 40 Nuns. This was built but an age ago. They purchase their living by their labour, for they have no Revenues; only the Abbot of the great Mona∣stry
<PB REF="52"/>
is oblig'd to supply them with a Reverend Ancient Monk, to do all Sacred Offices among them. Besides these, there are some small Hermitages that maintain some few Monks. 1. The Hermitage of the Holy <HI>Grotto</HI> of St. <HI>John</HI> the Divine. 2. The Hermitage of the <HI>Parasceve.</HI> 3. Of the Annun∣tiation of the Blessed Virgin, late∣ly built by a Bishop in this last Cen∣tury. 4. The Hermitage, called <HI>Asomati.</HI> Lastly, in a place called the Gardens, which furnish the Monks Kitchin with all necessaries. They have certain Chappels con∣secrated for the Labourers, at cer∣tain Hours, to hear Prayers, and so return to their Work.</P>
<P>And this is the present Condition of the Isle of <HI>Patmos,</HI> once famous for the Residence of that great Apo∣stle St. <HI>John,</HI> and for the great and mysterious Revelation he had in it. But now groaning under the Yoke of such Lords as are common ene∣mies to the Christian Faith, by whom they are both kept in great
<PB N="84" REF="53"/>
awe, and slavish obedience, and yet ill protected against the violent Incursion of Pirats and Robbers: so that Poverty is their best Pro∣tection against Rapine, and Pa∣tience the only Remedy against the grievous Yoak of Tyrannical Op∣pression.</P>

<P>MOunt <HI>Athos</HI> is a demy-Isle, or Chersonese, lying betwixt the Gulf of <HI>Strymon,</HI> from a River of that name on the North, and the Gulf of <HI>Singus,</HI> from the Town <HI>Singus,</HI> on the South.

<P>Not far from this Cross, without the Bounds, on the Water-side, stands a Village call'd <HI>Alladiava.</HI> The Inhabitants live most upon Fishing, and bring their Fish to sell to the <HI>Caloris.</HI> If perchance their Wives, or any Women of their Family come along with the Men, they are left in the Boat, and not suffer▪d to step a Shore, for fear of Excommunication; for the highest Rule of Discipline, and the most strictly observed, is that of not conversing with Women. And for more caution, and better security of preserving this Rule inviolable, they suffer no other
<PB N="87" REF="54"/>
Female Creature of what kind soe∣ver, nor any Children, or young men, that are Beardless to come within the Mount.</P>
<P>In describing the place, we can∣not pass from Town to Village, but only from Monastrys to Her∣mitages.</P>
<P>1. The first, and most ancient, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sain</HI> Laura's <HI>Monastr.</HI></NOTE> St. <HI>Laura,</HI> built by <HI>Athanasius,</HI> who obtained special License of the Emperour of <HI>Constantinople</HI> to retire hither, and found a College of Monks; so called, from that Mo∣nastry of <HI>Laura</HI> of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> where St. <HI>Saba</HI> liv'd, and his Disci∣ple <HI>John,</HI> once Bishop of <HI>Colonia</HI> in <HI>Armenia,</HI> and afterwards Monk, after the Discipline of St. <HI>Saba;</HI> whose Disciples, from a peculiar Rule of Silence, which they did solemnly profess, and strictly pra∣ctice, were call'd <HI>Silentiarii.</HI> Of this Order was <HI>Anastasius</HI> the Empe∣rour, before he was advanc'd to the Imperial Dignity: Of whom <HI>Ba∣ronius</HI> relates, that in the Year of our Lord, 491, he was from a
<PB N="88" REF="55"/>
Professour of silence, made a Sove∣raign Prince, <HI>Ex Silentiario factus Imperator.</HI> The Monks of the place have a long Story, how this <HI>Atha∣nasius,</HI> wanting Money to go on with the great Church of the Mo∣nastry, which he had begun, was met with by the Blessed Virgin, who took his staff from him, and smote a Rock, 'till it sent out a Spring of Water, that runs at this day; then thrusting his staff into the Ground, it became a Tree, and sent forth Boughs and Leaves. Then she bid him take no care for ne∣cessaries, she would provide, and did avow her self to be the Patroness of that Monastry, and of the whole Mountain. This Monastry is about a Mile from the Sea, on the East side, and hath a conveni∣ent Channel, that brings up Ves∣sels to their very Walls; where they have a strong Magazin, and a Sentinel perpetually standing to give notice of any <HI>Corsairs.</HI> It hath likewise a very fair Church, and in their Hall, where they eat in
<PB N="89" REF="55"/>
common, there is a large Marble Table, where 600 Monks sit down together.</P>
<P>2. The Monastry of <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Cara∣cale.</NOTE> <HI>Caracale,</HI> the Name of its Founder, who did consecrate it to the Apostles St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul.</HI> This is eight Miles from the former, towards the North. It maintains 500 Monks. The Gate of the Monastry is adorn'd with an exceeding high Tower. Here is likewise a Cistern cut out of a Rock 26 Fathoms deep. This also being near the Sea, has upon the shore a Watch Tower, a Maga∣zin, and a little Port.</P>
<P>3. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Philo¦the.</NOTE> <HI>Philothe,</HI> from the Founders name. This maintains but 50 Monks, though well stor'd with Orchards and Gardens, with its Watch Tower, and Magazin also by the Sea side. Their Church is dedicated to the Annuntiation of the Blessed Virgin.</P>
<P>4. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Imbe¦rus.</NOTE> <HI>Imberus,</HI> by the name of its Founder. This Monastry is in great repute for a Picture of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> upon the Gate, which
<PB N="90" REF="56"/>
Picture, by the report of Tradi∣tion, was found floating by the Shore. This Monastry has good Revenues in <HI>Imbrus,</HI> and maintains 400 Monks.</P>
<P>5. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Coutul∣mousi,</NOTE> <HI>Coutulmousi</HI> maintains 300 Monks; it is commodiously sur∣rounded with Gardens, and has a fair Church dedicated to the Trans∣figuration of our Saviour.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Porpat.</HI> Here is the general As∣sembly of all the Monastries in this Mountain; hither every Monastry sends a Deputy under the name of <HI>Proesti,</HI> whose business is to reside in the place, and to be ready to consult of all affairs that concern the publick Good. Here is every <HI>Saturday</HI> a publick Market, and the only Market within the whole cir∣cumference of the Mount. Here also dwells the <HI>Aga,</HI> with two or three other <HI>Turks,</HI> who protects them from all injuries of other <HI>Turks,</HI> especially of the Sea-men from <HI>Barbary,</HI> whom they call <HI>Le∣vents.</HI> The <HI>Bostangy-Basha</HI> appoints this Officer from amongst the <HI>Bo∣stangies.</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="56"/>
He is to stay in his Office two years, and then another suc∣ceeds him. He is maintained at the common charge of the <HI>Caloirs,</HI> who give him a yearly Pension. And besides, upon every Church Festival, he is invited from Mona∣stry to Monastry, by course, and there, besides the Entertainment of him and his Retinue, he is always presented with a Purse of Money, according to the abilities of the Monastry.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Stauro-Nikita,</HI> or <HI>The Conque∣ring Cross.</HI> This maintains but 30 Monks. Their Church is dedi∣cated to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> where they have in great estimation his Picture upon a Board, that was found ready painted, as a Wreck, and devoutly taken up by the Monks of this Co∣vent.</P>
<P>8. <HI>Pantocratoras</HI> maintains 200 Monks; their Church is dedicated to the Transfiguration of our Bles∣sed Saviour.</P>
<P>9. <HI>Vatopedi</HI> maintains 300, their Church is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="57"/>10. <HI>Tousimenou</HI> has but 80 Monks; the Church is dedicated to the As∣cension. It is the poorest of all the Monastry, not for want of Lands, but of Men to cultivate them. For the soil about, is the best in all the Mount. It bears Olives of a singular largeness, and wants no other sort of Fruit Trees. But the number of the Monks in it amount but to 80, who being not able to make the best advantage of so much good ground continue poor in a plentiful Soil.</P>
<P>In the middle of all the Mount stands 11. <HI>Chiliantary,</HI> a Mona∣stry of the <HI>Bulgarians,</HI> who speak here their own Language, and have their Prayers (though the same with the <HI>Greek</HI>) in the <HI>Bulga∣rian</HI> Language. This is the lar∣gest Monastry of the whole Island, and maintains 800 Monks. They have much Land abroad, which they send their own Monks to cul∣tivate.</P>
<P>12. <HI>Touzographou,</HI> or the <HI>Painters Convent,</HI> from the Founder, who
<PB N="93" REF="57"/>
was a Painter. The Church is consecrated to St. <HI>George,</HI> it main∣tains 200 Monks, all <HI>Bulgarians.</HI> There is a little Church not far from this Monastry, that stands alone, and now is useless; but ha∣ving a fair Picture of St. <HI>George</HI> in it, the Monks thought fit to bring it into their own Church; but to no purpose, for so often as they brought it, so often it takes its leave, and is found the next day in the Church.</P>
<P>13. <HI>Xenophon,</HI> a <HI>Burgarian</HI> Mo∣nastry, has but 30 <HI>Caloirs.</HI></P>
<P>14. <HI>Castamoniti</HI> has not above six, or seven Monks at most, yet it hath a Chappel dedicated to St. <HI>Steven.</HI></P>
<P>15. <HI>Archangeli,</HI> which had before another name, but changed to this upon this occasion. A young <HI>Ca∣loir,</HI> that was tilling the Ground abroad, found a Treasure in an old Urn, and brought the news of it to the Superiour of the Convent; he sent with the young Man two other <HI>Caloirs,</HI> who finding the Treasure, agreed between them∣selves
<PB N="94" REF="58"/>
to kill the Boy, and share it betwixt them; and so they ty'd a Stone about his neck, and cast him into the Sea, and hiding the Trea∣sure, came to the Superiour, and told him the Boy had deceiv'd them, and was run away. Next mor∣ning the Sexton found the Boy and the Stone about his neck in the Church, who discover'd all, and told that the Angels <HI>Gabriel</HI> and <HI>Raphael</HI> brought him thither. The two <HI>Caloirs</HI> thus convicted, were banish'd, and this stone set up as a Monument to this day.</P>
<P>16. The Monastry of <HI>Russicon</HI> has a Church dedicated to <HI>Panteleimon,</HI> and maintains 20 <HI>Caloirs.</HI></P>
<P>17. <HI>Xeropotamou,</HI> dedicated to the Memory of 40 Martyrs that were drowned in the Lake of <HI>Se∣baste.</HI> This Monastry has 300 Monks, and being by the Sea side, has a Magazin and a great Watch-Tower. Over against this Mona∣stry, on the Continent of <HI>Macedo∣nia,</HI> stands a great Village of Her∣mits and religious Persons, though
<PB N="95" REF="58"/>
without the bounds of the <HI>Caloirs.</HI></P>
<P>18. <HI>Simo-Petra,</HI> so called, from the Founder and the Foundation. It is situate on a Rock, and was founded by one <HI>Simon,</HI> an Hermit, who by his Prayers having cured the Daughter of a Governour of <HI>Cassandria,</HI> did move him to bestow enough for to build this Monastry, and 200 Monks. They shew here an hand for a sacred Relique of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s body, but the Fingers of it are extraordinary great.</P>
<P>19. <HI>Gregorios,</HI> near the Sea, and much infested with Pirats for want of Fortification, and men to de∣fend it, having but 60 Monks.</P>
<P>20. <HI>Dionisiou,</HI> consecrated to St. <HI>John Baptist,</HI> whose Forehead they pretend to shew here as a sacred Relique. Besides they shew the Bones of one <HI>Nymphus,</HI> once Patri∣arch of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> who being weary of publick employment, re∣tir'd hither, unknown to any who he was; so they looking upon him as a poor Vagabond, that wanted
<PB N="96" REF="59"/>
work, employ'd him as their Mule∣teer, to fetch in their wood; in which employment he continued with great humility and faithfulness many years, not offering to ride any of the Mules going or coming, and kept all the Church Fasts strictly in the midst of all his drud∣gery. At his death-bed he disco∣ver'd to the Superiour who he was, and that he chose that manner of Life to mortifie his proud Flesh. Whereupon, looking upon him as a Saint, they keep his Bones as a sacred Relique.</P>
<P>21. <HI>Hagios Paulos,</HI> so named from the Founder, who was reputed a Saint. It maintains 200 Monks, all <HI>Bulgarians.</HI></P>
<P>Pass we now to the Hermitages, which are very small, but common∣ly so neer one another, as to make the appearance of a Village. There are two places where they lye in great numbers. 1. <HI>Hagia Aena,</HI> or St. <HI>Ain,</HI> from a Church dedicated to that Saint. These are the reti∣ring places of such Hermits as live
<PB N="97" REF="59"/>
by Manufacture, as particularly, the making of Crosses and Figures that represent our Saviours Passion, and Seals and Marks proper for the consecrated Bread. The <HI>Caloirs</HI> that are sent abroad to confess Peo∣ple, and to gather Alms for pious Uses, buy up all these Manufactures to present unto people among whom they come. These Hermits live more retired and melancholly, being not above two or three, some∣times but one in an House. And they do imitate the Lives of those antient Monks in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> about <HI>Thebais,</HI> that were imitators of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> who did himself, as did all his followers, live and main∣tain themselves by hand labour and manufactures, though of a very mean sort, yet enough to earn them Food and Raiment. This St. <HI>An∣thony</HI> was the first <HI>Christian</HI> Monk of the World, his Food was only Bread and Water; yet he liv'd 150 years: His fame was so great, that <HI>Helen,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, did by letters sent to him,
<PB N="98" REF="60"/>
recommend Her self and her Son to his Prayers. He dy'd in the Wil∣derness. <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 361. 2. <HI>Kera∣sia,</HI> another plot of Ground, all strew'd with such Hermitages as are at St. <HI>Aine,</HI> and they live in the very same manner.</P>
<P>Besides these Hermitages that lye so neer in voisinage, there are above 1000 more dispersed up and down the Island, which do all be∣long to some one of the Monastries. If a Man desire to live in a Cell, he gives a certain Rate to that Mona∣stry to which it belongs, and so is empowr'd to enjoy that Cell, and the Land belonging to't for his life: when he dies, it returns to the Mo∣nastry, and the Monastry is Heir to all that he leaves behind him. There are Cells of all rates, from 5 Dol∣lers to 150. One thing is very re∣markable, that Idleness is utterly banish'd here, no man lives in the Isle, who is not some way employ'd.</P>
<P>As for the maintenance of these Monastries, though their Lands be sufficient to seed them, and their
<PB REF="60"/>
Mountain furnish them with Wine enough to drink; yet as the matter is order'd, they commonly want Money to pay their <HI>Haratch,</HI> or yearly Tribute of 3 Dollers <HI>per</HI> Poll, and buy themselves Cloaths and Furniture for tilling their Land. So that every year they select some of their <HI>Caloirs</HI> to go abroad, and beg the Charity of <HI>Christian</HI> People, towards the relief of the respective Monastry. And these are always by two and two together. And the Monastries agree before-hand to what particular places they will send their respective Emissaries, who continue ordinarily two or three years in their perambulation. At their coming home, the Money is delivered to the <HI>Skenaphylax,</HI> or the Steward of the Monastry; for it is against the Rule of their Order, to meddle with Money. He layes it out upon necessary occasions, and what is left, is kept to defray the Charge of another Voyage. They have a Register of those that bestow any thing, and they pray for
<PB N="100" REF="61"/>
them constantly in the Monastry.</P>
<P>When they are chosen to go abroad, the Chief of the Mona∣stry names one of the <HI>Caloirs:</HI> The Person named, in token of his obedience, doth prostrate himself on the Ground before the Superiour of the Monastry, and rising, kisses the Superiours hand. Then the Person first nam'd, names those that shall go along with him, who in like obedience, first prostrate them∣selves before the Superiour, and kiss his hand, then do the like to the <HI>Caloir</HI> first nam'd by the Con∣vent, and own him for their Father and Superiour, to whom they owe all obedience during their mission. When they go abroad, they first ap∣ply themselves to the <HI>Metropolite</HI> of the Diocese, and shew him their Letters of Obedience from their Superiours. Whereupon the <HI>Me∣tropolite</HI> gives them Letters of Per∣mission to ask Charity, and confess Penitents throughout his Diocese. Where they Confess any, they exact nothing of them by way of pecu∣niary
<PB N="101" REF="61"/>
Penance, but only receive what in charity they freely bestow.</P>
<P>The beginning of Monks in Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> was from the time that the <HI>Mahometans</HI> invaded <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> where the Monks in those places enjoying no security of their lives, came into <HI>Gyeece,</HI> and desired of the Emperour a Place to live in, according to their Mona∣stick way. He appointed them Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> and <HI>Athanasius</HI> sore∣mention'd, was the first that foun∣ded a College here. They profes∣sed at first the imitation of St. <HI>An∣thony</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and St. <HI>Sabas;</HI> but now the Rules of their Order are taken from St. <HI>Basil.</HI></P>
<P>At their first coming to Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> they were a Colony of the Monks of the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> who fol∣low'd the Rules of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and St. <HI>Sabas;</HI> but chiefly the Rules of St. <HI>Sabas,</HI> who liv'd long after St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> when Monkery began to alter its mode and fashion, and from a casual Retirement of some few men to a rude and simple
<PB N="102" REF="62"/>
way of life in the Wilderness, to become subject to Rules and Orders, to incorporate into Societies, to change their Caves into Cloisters, and to remove from Deserts to good dwelling Houses, and places of better convenience and accommo∣dation. This St. <HI>Sabas,</HI> by his emi∣nent and singular strictness, did highly advance the Fame and Ad∣miration of a Monastick life. He was by birth a <HI>Cappadocian,</HI> of the Village of <HI>Mutalasca,</HI> in the Diocese of <HI>Caesarea,</HI> and being left Heir to a good Estate, under the Care of his Uncle <HI>Hermias,</HI> the perverseness of his Aunt made him quit that Uncles House, and go to <HI>Scandos,</HI> to live with another Uncle, whose name was <HI>Gregory.</HI> This breeding a Dissention between the two Un∣cles, he, to avoid all occasion of dis∣cord, betook himself to the Mona∣stry of <HI>Flavianae</HI> near <HI>Mutalasca;</HI> whence at the eighteenth year of his Age, he went to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to visit those places which our Blessed Saviours life and death hath made
<PB N="103" REF="62"/>
so memorable. At that time the Fame of <HI>Euthymius,</HI> then Abbot of <HI>Laura</HI> by <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> was very great in the <HI>Holy Land.</HI> This enflam'd young <HI>Sabas</HI> with great desire to be admitted into his Monastry: Wherefore one day as <HI>Euthymius</HI> was going to receive the Sacrament, he fell down at his feet, begging leave to be entred into his College: But <HI>Euthymius</HI> gave him the Repulse, tel∣ling him it was not fitting that so young a Man should be admitted into <HI>Laura;</HI> yet he would recom∣mend him to a smaller Monastry hard by, where St. <HI>Theoctistes</HI> was Abbot: Where having stay'd ten years, <HI>Euthymius</HI> admitted him in∣to a Cave by his own Monastry for five years. Then <HI>Euthymius</HI> selected him, and <HI>Domitian</HI> to vye <HI>asketick</HI> Severities in a solitary Place for four years, which having perform'd to great admiration, about the For∣tieth year of his Age he retir'd to a Cave by the Brook of <HI>Siloe.</HI> By that time he had liv'd here five years he had a College of Disciples, to
<PB N="104" REF="63"/>
the number of 70, amongst whom was <HI>John</HI> the Silentiary, Bishop of <HI>Colonia</HI> in <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> before he en∣tred into his Monastick life, and afterwards Abbot of this College, which was call'd <HI>Nova Laura.</HI> There were afterwards more Monastries of this name in <HI>Palaestin. Laura Pyrgi∣orum</HI> by <HI>Jordan,</HI> built by one <HI>Jaco∣bus. Laura Malischae,</HI> built by <HI>Fir∣minus,</HI> and <HI>Laura Marichae,</HI> by <HI>Seve∣rianus,</HI> and <HI>Laura Elcerebae,</HI> by <HI>Juli∣anus.</HI> But this <HI>Laura,</HI> built by St. <HI>Sabas,</HI> was the most Famous, where in his life-time the number of his Monks encreas'd to 150. He was eminent in the time of <HI>Anasta∣sius, Justinus,</HI> and <HI>Justinianus,</HI> Em∣perours of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and dy'd in the 94<SUP>th</SUP> year of his Age. His name is yet very remarkable among the Eastern <HI>Christians,</HI> especially at Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> whose first Monks were but a Colony of his Disciples, and whose ancientest College is cal∣led <HI>Laura,</HI> from his <HI>Laura</HI> in <HI>Palaestine.</HI></P>
<P>Their constant morning Prayer is three hours before day; their
<PB N="105" REF="63"/>
evening Prayer at Sun-set. On <HI>Sundays</HI> they go to Prayers five hours before day in the morning, and before great Holy-days their Prayers continue all night. They have likewise other set hours of Prayer for the day-time.</P>
<P>They that enter into this profes∣sion, are kept six months Proba∣tioners; during which time they are put to all the Exercise they must undergo in their Profession. After the six months are expired, the Novitiat chuseth among the Old <HI>Caloirs</HI> a God-father to introduce him, and to instruct him in the Ceremony of his Admission. This God-father brings him to the Church door, where he is strip'd to his Shirt, and prostrates himself, then he makes a second prostration in the middle of the Church, and a third at the Altar, and a fourth to the Superiour. Then upon his knees he answers to all the Interro∣gatories made him by the Superiour, which are commonly these.</P>

<P>After these and some more Que∣stions of like nature, some Prayers are said out of the <HI>Euchologion,</HI> and the Superiour shewing him the Book of the Gospel, doth conjure him by it, if he come to that Pro∣fession of his own proper motion. He answering in the Affirmative, the Superiour gives him a pair of Scissers, bidding him deliver them back into his hand: Which done,
<PB N="107" REF="64"/>
the Superiour cuts off a little of his hair in the form of a Cross, saying,</P>
<P><HI>Our Brother</HI> N. N. <HI>hath his head shaven, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</HI> The rest that stand by say three times <HI>Kyrie Eleeson.</HI> Then his Monastick habit is put on in order.</P>
<P>1. his <HI>Cassock,</HI> whereat the Su∣periour says,</P>
<P><HI>Our Brother</HI> N. <HI>puts on the Garment of gladness, in the name of the Father,</HI> &amp;c. The Company say thrice <HI>Kyrie Eleeson.</HI></P>
<P>2. His Girdle with these words.</P>
<P><HI>Our Brother girds his reins with the strength of truth, to mortifie his Body, and to renew his Spirit, in the name of the Fa∣ther,</HI> &amp;c. Then follows the <HI>Kyrie Eleeson</HI> thrice.</P>
<P>3. His Bonnet with these words.</P>
<P><HI>Our Brother puts on the Hel∣met of Hope and Salvation, in the name of the Father,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>4. His Mantle, with these words:</P>
<P><HI>He puts on the Mantle as the</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="65"/>
<HI>earnest of Angelique apparel, and of incorruptible Glory, in the name of the Father,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>5. His Sandals, with these words.</P>
<P><HI>He puts on the Shoes of the preparation of the Gospel of Peace, in the name of the Father,</HI> &amp;c. with the <HI>Kyrie Eleeson</HI> thrice, as in all the rest. Then after the rehear∣sal of an Epistle and Gospel, and some Prayers, they put a Cross in∣to his hand with these words:</P>
<P><HI>Our Saviour saith, if any man will be my Disciple, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross, and follow me.</HI> Then a Candle lighted is put into his hands, with these words.</P>
<P><HI>Our Lord hath said, Let your Light so shine before men, that they seeing your good works, may glorifie your Father who is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>This done, the other <HI>Caloirs,</HI> every one salute him with a Kiss, and so the Ceremony is ended.</P>
<LIST>
<HEAD>The Rules are these,</HEAD>
<ITEM>1. To renounce the World, and
<PB N="109" REF="65"/>
all that is near, and dear to them in it, as a Father and Mother, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to that of our Saviour.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To continue in the Monastry in obedience to the Superiour and his Brethren.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To suffer all afflictions, and torments for the Love of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To have nothing of their own, but all in common among their Brethren.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. To keep themselves unspot∣ted from all carnality.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. To be always ready to go to Prayers at the appointed Hours. At Midnight; before Day; at Noon; at three a Clock after Noon; at Sun-set; and after Sup∣per: And after all this, when they go to their Cells, where they lye, to make 60 Prostrations, which they call <HI>Metánoia's,</HI> or Pennances, with a short Prayer to every one for the Superiour; for their Bre∣thren; for the Benefactors of the Monastry, and in general, for all <HI>Christians.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Not to eat or drink in secret,
<PB N="110" REF="66"/>
but in common with their Bre∣thren; and this is so observ'd, that in case they are pinch'd with thirst betwixt Meals, they drink at the Window, or Door of the Cell, that all may see them, and before they drink, they cry aloud, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. <HI>Give thanks.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Not to eat Flesh all their lives, which is so strictly observed in Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> that in no sick∣ness they are permitted to break this rule; but the Monks that Tra∣vel, in case of sickness, may eat Flesh, if the Physician advise them to't. But in Mount <HI>Athos</HI> they are allow'd on <HI>Sundays, Tuesdays, Thursdays,</HI> and <HI>Saturdays,</HI> to eat Eggs, Butter, Cheese, and Fish; the other days they eat none of these, nor drink any thing but Water only; and those other days they have only a Dinner, at Night they eat a piece of Bread, and drink a little water at the Church-door, and so to Prayers, and thence to their Cells, where they remain in great silence. But the Sick, Aged,
<PB N="111" REF="66"/>
and such as have newly come from a Journey, are allow'd to eat in the common Refectory.</ITEM>
