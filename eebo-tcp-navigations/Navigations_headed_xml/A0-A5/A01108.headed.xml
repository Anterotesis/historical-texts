<HEAD>The Preface to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>ENTLE READER,</HI> expect not heere any florishing Phrases or Floquent tearmes, for this Child of mine begot in the North-wests cold Clime, (where they breed no Schollers,) is not able to digest the sweet milke of Retho∣rick, that's food for them▪ the Parent not be∣ing able to maintaine it any longer, it being now past the Cradle, hopes, the Publike will willingly bestow Education of the Infant for his better breeding; for which the Father prayeth, and the rather because the Midwife perswades him that the Child lookes like himselfe, there were some desired to have had him come abroad like the Lapwing, before the shell was from over his head, but the Nurse more carefull of the tenderly borne Infant procrastinated the time, supposing that after birth it would strengthen apace in this temporate Clime, and in time be the better able to Iourney; but in Conclusion its turned to Discoverie, not of a Passage but of the way to find one, to come to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le <HI>Iapon, China,</HI> and the Orient all <HI>India;</HI> of which, hea∣ring that divers inquired after; (for who would not share in such Treasures as there's to be had) as what hath <HI>Fox</HI> done, others how farre farre hath hee beene, hath he beene as farre as any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an, If there be a Passage how chance hee hath not found it, if not, why doe they search after it; and in fine, hath hee made a Voyage or no, the mea∣ning of this last I know not, nor I thinke they neither; but for that the most desire to know what I have done, and how farre I have bin; I answer as the Old women tells tales, <HI>Further and further than</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>I can tell;</HI> and for the rest I referre them to mine owne Iournall: For I hope it may satisfie those that are indifferent, and that stand well affected to those Discovering enterprises, for whose cause and the good or content of others it was chiefly compiled. I doe confesse, that they have not done me much amisse in causing me to show my selfe; for hereby they shall know, that before this vndertaking I was not ignorant of what my predecessors had done before I came, which was no small helpe both to my safety and proceeding. For some will Calumniate out of malice, some for that they dislike all things but what themselves or friends doth; but I hope the judiciall Sea-man will stand in my defence: For amongst those inquisitors, especially the never-satisfied-curious, I finde few that doth or will know what they inquire after, other having other im∣ployments rests content with the verball Report of their owne Times, rather than looke after the La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Experiences of so vnpleasant, and as it is held vnprofitable a Voyage. For these and others, I leave to peruse what shall follow, wherein the desirous may bee satisfied, how every Successour (as his fancy, direction, or opinion guided) thought to rectifie himselfe by others mistaking, or to finde the Passage in those places left vnsearched or perfectly discovered: For no question, but this Voyage might long since have attained his full perfection; if the first beginners had beene yearely continued, which since Captaine <HI>DAVIS</HI> was not, but sup∣plyed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wayes (after some yeares of breathing) by Greene men, or those who (in that time) had forgot their experience; nay, I may avo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch, that if this course had beene taken, and private ends had beene wanting, that since Mr. <HI>HVDSON</HI> his first Voyage 1610. the Passage had been sayled through before 1618. and done at one quarter of the Charge; and howsoever it was not my for∣tune to finde, yet I praise GOD for that I have brought home the newes thereof, though I have left it for him whose time God shall be pleased to ripen for the same; For it is a wonder that a Voyage of such Consequence as this, wherein all the parts of Navigation may be practised, should so longlye raked in the embers and no
<PB REF="4"/>
further search made thereinto, (conside-ring that within these few yeares, there hath bin more excellent Secrets in Navigation found out then hath beene in all the former Ages) it being (no questi∣on) but more then the difficultest halfe Discovered; to incourage which thou shalt reade h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w great Princes have taken plea∣sure to increase their Dominions (in Person) by Navigation, as al∣so that our Ancestors were not so simple as we make them; and that this Hunting of the Whale (which as yet wee make rare) was in practice in King <HI>ALFREDS</HI> time related by <HI>OCTHER,</HI> who cald him Lord, as King <HI>ARTHVRS</HI> Successour; which <HI>OCTHER</HI> say∣led about the North Cape of <HI>Finm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rke,</HI> as appeareth by his owne Narration, and this was long before <HI>RICHARD CHANCELOR,</HI> whom wee make <HI>Prima.</HI> I begin with those Princes, to show the Honour and Renowne of our Nation, and so proceed to all that went before me North-Westwards, out of a coniecturall necessity which I conceive them to bee as Appendices to the Iournals of these mo∣derne times.</P>
<P>It will be obiected, that many of these Abstracts are taken out of other Bookes, and that those are the Voyages of other men; I answer it is true, the most of them are. For what are all those of Mr. <HI>Hac∣kl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Purchas,</HI> but the Collections and preservations of other mens labours; For who can speake or write that which was never done before, and I doe confesse my selfe to be infinitly bound vnto them and others for their paines; for if they had not bin thus carefully stored vp, these had beene wanting as are divers others. For in searching thou shalt finde, that the workes of many brave men are buried in oblivion, whose Names are devolved and but something brought vnto vs through the succession of Ages, and though part of those workes have escaped, the wracke of the rest have perished in the Gulfe of time, which hath swallowed the best of many mens endeavors, and for those extant▪ thou canst not come vnto without labour and charge, all which I have brought to thy hands almost for nothing, considering the charge of Bookes of great prise, the labour in search and Quotations; besides, heere
<PB REF="5"/>
is much that never came in Print as yet, being very difficult to be had. And though I have abstracted those Workes of my Predeces∣sors, yet I have interlaced my owne experience, and beene curious not to leave out any thing of theirs or my owne, wherein I could thinke my remembrance might avayle thee. And although wee all have sometimes stumbled, yet wee may bee excused, considering the long and strange Iourney wee had to goe, and who followeth doth but persevere by our example, nor have I like the Poet feig∣ned a Storme where I had none: Nor doe I hold that man fit to take charge of Voyages remote, especially Northeast or Westward, and be Ignorant of those Abstracts and Iournals following. For I know, knowledge will conceive them to be good Preparatives. How∣soever in them I have done my best, and whosoever will amend them, I shall take him for my friend, I have restored all the names of Capes, Headlands, and Ilands formerly given by Captaine <HI>DA∣VIS,</HI> Mr <HI>HVDSON,</HI> and Sir <HI>THOMAS BVTTON,</HI> (which since have beene infringed vpon) vnto their first appellations, both in my Booke and Map. I doe confesse, that there be many who might more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itly have vndertaken this labour then my selfe, if they had been so well acquainted with the action; For we have many Prac∣titioners, whom we call Mathematicall Sea-men, who that after a little practice in Art, purposeth then to goe to Sea and Travell; therefore carefully busying themselves about perusing the Cosino∣graphicall Maps, and with great industry studied the bookes of Na∣vigation, and to better their knowledge, have enquired of many excellent Mariners for their better satisfaction, in the difficul∣test parts thereof, thinking that they are now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to set sayle and launch foorth to Sea, conceiting of themselves to bee farre more able then the Sea-man; yet when they have taken the charge of the Ship vpon them, and is hoyst forth of the quiet port into the ruffe and boisterous Ocean, where they shall behold many hideous moun∣taines of high threatning billowes, and raging waves, tempestuous gusts, with hayle, raine and thunder, Shifts of windes, and counter Seas, Currents, Races, Sets, and Over-fals, being deprived of Sun,
<PB REF="5"/>
Moone and Starres for long season, they will then thinke that they onely dreamed before, when they imagined of the Course of the Seas, and that their Bookes were but weake Schoolemasters, that the talke of Art were farre short of the Practice, when at beholding the Starres which they thought to have vsed as guides and directions▪ seeme now as they threatned their ruine and destruction; nay, when you shall looke forth and tremble at the rising of every wave, and shall be agast with feare to refraine those Rockes and dangers which lye hid within the Seas fairest bosome, together with the greatnesse of the Ocean, and smalnesse of their Ship; for want of experience to handle, not knowing how to shun, they will then thinke that the least gale is of force to overthrow them, and know that Art must be taught to practice by long and industrious vse. For it is not enough to be a Sea-man, but to be a painefull Sea-man; for a Sea∣bred man of reasonable Capacity, may attaine to so much Art as may serve to Circle the Earths Globe about, but the other wanting the experimentall part cannot▪ for I doe not allow any to be a good Sea man, that hath not vndergone the most Offices about a Ship, and that his youth hath bin both taught and inured to all labours; for to keepe a warme Cabbin &amp; lye in sheets, is the most ignoble part of a Sea man, but to endure and suffer; as a hard Cabbin, cold and salt Meate, broken sleepes, mould bread, dead beere, wet Cloathes, want of fire, all these are within board; besides Boate, Lead, Top∣yardes, Anchor-morings and the like. For as Oyle Paper layd vp∣on the obiect, makes it more transparant, so doth Experience show Art to see without spectacles; and concluding this point in starling for I have no other Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne and but small store of that, to those who saith, that I am but a North-Countrey Coaster, and hath but been brought vp in small Vessels. I wish their pride to know, that Gods mercy is over all his Creatures, and hath created as good men in the North as in the South, let no man bee disdained, misprised or vn∣dervalued for his wants (except in Vertues.) For I doe not thinke, but litle M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>IEFFERY</HI> that pretty Courtier, can pitch his eye-sight as high into the Firmament, as M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>EVANS</HI> his Maiesties great

Porter. And for Sea-men, where have you better than the <HI>Scotsh∣men</HI> are, and yet North-Countrey men. It was also cast into my dish, that I was an Officer of the Admiralty; a poore conceit to ob∣iect against me for this vndertaking, and as much as to say; as the greatest Civilian held to be in Christendome, cannot be capable of higher Promotion, if hee belong to the Admiraltie.</P>
<P>I have also placed a Polar Map or Card, that this Discoverie may be the better vnderstood, and for that I did desire to give sa∣tisfaction by Demonstration of all treated of in the Booke, for o∣therwise, another proiection could not have contained it but at vn∣reasonable diversity; and because I cannot describe all the Names in <HI>Fretum Hudson,</HI> of Capes, Ilands, and Bayes at length in Let∣ters, in respect of the smalnesse of the Degrees of Longitude, I have inserted them in a table by the letters of the Alphabet, as thou shalt find, beginning with <HI>A, b, c, d,</HI> and tracted my owne way and discovery foorth and home, in small prickes.</P>
<P>I acknowledge it to be but rough-hewen like Ship wrights <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im∣ber, but what it wants in smoothnesse or forme, let thy good Re∣port licke it into. I trust I shall not need to vse the fashion of Au∣thors, to make any doubt of carping <HI>Momus</HI> or rayling <HI>Zoilus,</HI> seeing I have intended thy Good without any Reservation to my selfe. But I feare mee I have held thee too long in this place, like him who purposeth to take a long Iourney stumbles vpon his owne threshold, but have Patience, for I had rather be in fault then want, I have here prostrated my duty to my King, and my service to my Countrey, craving thy favourable acceptance, I rest.</P>

<HEAD>The Voyage of <HI>Octher</HI> to the Northeast parts beyond <HI>Norway,</HI> reported by himselfe vnto <HI>Alfred</HI> the famous King of <HI>England,</HI> about the yeare. 890.</HEAD>
<P>OCTHER sayd, that the Countrey wherein he dweit was called <HI>Helgoland,</HI> hee told his Lord King <HI>Elfreed,</HI> that he

dwelt furthest North of any <HI>Norman,</HI> he sayd, that he dwelt towards the North part of the Land towards the West coast.

<HEAD>Therefore as followeth, out of the Comments of <HI>Arn∣grinus, Fitz Ionus. 1598.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Certaine Writer sayth, hee hath put downe the distance betweene the mouth of <HI>Elbe</HI> and <HI>Baczend</HI> in the South part of <HI>Iseland,</HI> to be 400. leagues; from whence if you will accompt the difference of Longitude, to the Meridian of <HI>Ham∣brough, Iseland</HI> must have none of the Longitudes accompted of, as 5. 7. 6. 20. 30. 28. 325. according to severall Authors, for I am able to prove by 3. severall Voyages of <HI>Hamburgers,</HI> that it is but 7. dayes sayle from <HI>Iseland</HI> to <HI>Hambrough,</HI> besides all the Ilands which for the abundance of Sheepe are called <HI>Far∣rier;</HI> as likewise the Desert shoares of <HI>Norway,</HI> are distant from us but two dayes sayling, wee have 4. dayes sayling in∣to habitable <HI>Groenland,</HI> and almost in the same quantity of time, wee past over to the Province of <HI>Norway</HI> called <HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> lying betweene the Townes of <HI>Oridrosia</HI> or <HI>Trondon,</HI> and <HI>Bar∣gon,</HI> as we find by antient Records of those Nations.</P>
<P><HI>Iseland</HI> hath bin called by three names one after another; for one <HI>Nuddocus</HI> a <HI>Norvegian</HI> borne, who is thought to bee the first Discoverer thereof, as he was sayling towards <HI>Farra</HI> Ilands, through a violent Tempest did by chance arrive at the East shore of <HI>Iseland,</HI> where beholding the Mountaines tops covered with Snow, called this Iland <HI>Snowland.</HI></P>
<P>After this one <HI>Gardarus,</HI> being moved with <HI>Nuddocus</HI> re∣ports, went to seeke, and when hee had found, hee called it <HI>Garders</HI> Ile.</P>
<P>After these two, one <HI>Flok</HI> went into this Land, and named it after the Ice hee found there, <HI>Iceland.</HI></P>
<P>This land hath some yeares no Ice at all, as in 1592. but the Sea is open for most yeares from <HI>Aprill</HI> to <HI>Ianuary,</HI> and in <HI>May</HI> all is driven to the West, and this Land hee inhabited about the yeare of our Lord, 874.</P>
<P>In the yeare 1591. there was a Ship of <HI>Germany</HI> lay laden with Copper 14. dayes in the harbour of <HI>Vopnaford;</HI> in <HI>No∣vember</HI> she set sayle and departed; this was some ship of the <HI>Balticke</HI> Sea, or <HI>Hambrough,</HI> which durst not goe through the Narrow seas for <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>

<P>At the counsell of Mr. <HI>Anthonie</HI> they goe on Land, when they heard of the good successe of <HI>Zichmni</HI> in his warres, and that all the Iland by Embassadors was yeilded vnto him.</P>

<HEAD>Thus much is taken out of a Letter that Mr. <HI>Nicolo</HI> sent to his Brother <HI>Anthonie,</HI> requesting that he would seeke some meanes to come to him.</HEAD>
<P>MAster <HI>Anthonie</HI> furnisht a ship, and after great danger with great joy arrived with his Brother, where he re∣mained 14. yeares, 4. yeares with his Brother and 10. yeares alone, where they so behaued themselues, that <HI>Nicolo</HI> was made Captaine of <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chmnies</HI> Nauie; they set forth for the en∣terprise of <HI>Estland,</HI> being betweene <HI>Friesland</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> but by storme of wind they were driven vpon certaine

shoales, where a great part of their Fleete was cast away. The King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> comming to rescue <HI>Estland,</HI> his Fleete vt∣terly perished, which <HI>Zichmni</HI> having notice of by a ship of the Enemies, he determines to set vpon <HI>Iseland.</HI></P>
<P>Which together with the rest, was subiect to the King of <HI>Norway,</HI> but he finding the Country well fortified, his small Fleete were glad to retire; In the same channels he assaulted the other Iles, called <HI>Iseland;</HI> which are 7. <HI>Talas, Broas, Heance, Trans, Mimant, Dambere,</HI> and <HI>Brest;</HI> and having spoiled them all, hee built a Fort in <HI>Brest,</HI> where he left Mr. <HI>Nicolo</HI> with men, small Barkes, and Munition, and with the few ships he had left, he returned to <HI>Friesland.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nicolo</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with 3. small Barkes sailes Northward, and arrives in <HI>Engroneland,</HI> where he found a Monasterie of Friers, neare a hill that casteth forth fire, like <HI>Vesurius &amp; Etna.</HI></P>
<P>They subsist specially, by a Fountaine of water issuing from that Hill, whereby the Monastery and all other buildings are refreshed and warmed at their pleasure, as also their Gardens thowed and watered, their stones for building are cast out of this combustable forge, which being once cooled will not dis∣solue, but taken hot and cast into Water, maketh a marvailous strong lime, the people haue these devoted men in great vene∣ration.</P>
<P>They feed vpon wild Fowle and Fish, for the Bay or Ha∣ven, by reason of the heate of this Water doth neuer freeze, by meanes whereof, there is such concourse of Sea-fowle and abundance of fish, whereby all the people are fed and main∣tained, and 1000. imployed about taking the same. Hither in Summer time, which lasts but three Moneths, come many Barkes from the Ilands thereabout, and from the Cape about <HI>Norway,</HI> and from <HI>Trondon,</HI> and exchange all needfull commo∣dities for fish, which they dry with the Sunne or cold: to this Monastery resort many Friers of <HI>Norway, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etia,</HI> but the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Frost l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣steth 9.

Their Boates are made like vnto Weavers shuttles, taking the skins of fishes, and sowing them together in many doubles, they fashion them with the bones of the same fish, and make them so sure and substantiall, that it is marvailous to see, how
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
in tempests they will shut themselues close with in, and let the sea and wind carry them they care not whither, without either breaking or drowning, and if they chance to be driven vpon the Rocks, they remaine sound without any bruise at all, and they haue as it were a sleeue in the bottome which is ty∣ed fast in the middle, and when there commeth any water in∣to the Boat, they put it into the one halfe of the sleeue, then fastening the end with two peeces of wood, and loosening the band beneath, they convay the water forth of the Boat, and this they doe as often as they have occasion.</P>
<P>Moreover, this Water is of a Sulphurous brimstone nature, and is conveyed into vessels of Brasse, Tinne, and Stone, and so imployed to all vses, to warme their houses, or boile their meate without any stinke, or noisome smell.

<P>Mr. <HI>Nicolo:</HI> dyed in <HI>Friesland,</HI> and being dead <HI>Anthonie</HI> suc∣ceeded him both in Goods and Dignitie, and albeit he attemp∣ted and made great supplication, yet could he not obtaine li∣cence to returne to his Countrey. For <HI>Zichmni</HI> intended to make himselfe Lord of the Sea, vsed his counsell, and deter∣mined to send him with divers Barkes to the West-wards; for that certaine Fishermen of his, had discovered certaine Ilands very rich and populous, which discovery Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI> in a Letter to his Brother <HI>Carolo</HI> recounteth thus:</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>SIx and twenty yeares since, there departed 4. fisher Boates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Estotoland</NOTE> the which a mighty tempest, tossed too &amp; fro divers dayes, when at length they discovered, an Iland called <HI>Estotoland,</HI> lying West-ward above 1000. miles from <HI>Freesland,</HI> vpon which, one of the Boates was cast away, and the 6. men there∣in were taken and carried to a faire and populous City, where the King sent for many Interpreters, but none could vnderstand their language, but one who spoake Latine, who was also cast there by chance, who vnderstanding their case, rehearsed it to the King, who caused thē to stay in his Country 3. yeares, in which time they learned the Language: one of them was in divers parts of the Iland, and reports it to be Rich and aboundeth with all Commodities of the world, it is little lesse then <HI>Iseland,</HI> but farre more fruitfull, in the mid∣dle
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
is a Mountaine, from whence there Springs 4. Rivers that passe through the whole Countrey.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are very witty people, and have all Arts and faculties as we have, and it is credible that in times past, they have had traffique with our men; for be said, he saw La∣tine bookes in the Kings Library, which at that present they did not understand, they have a peculiar language and letters or characters to themselves, they have Mines of all manner of mettals, but they abound with Gold; they have trade in <HI>En∣groneland,</HI> from whence they bring Furres, Brimstone, and Pitch, he saith, that to the Southward, there is a great populous country very rich in gold, they sow Corne, and make Beere and Ale, and use it as we do wine, they have mighty great woods, there are many Cities and Castles. They build small Barkes, and have sayling, but they have not the Loadstone, nor know not the use of the Compasse; wherefore the Fishers were had in great estimation, insomuch that the King sent them South∣ward to a country they call <HI>Dorgio,</HI> but in that voyage they had such weather, that they thought to have perished in the sea, but escaping that, they fell into another more cruell, for they were taken in the Country and the most part of them<NOTE PLACE="marg">Man eaters.</NOTE> eaten of the Salvage people, which fed upon Mans flesh as the sweetest meat.</P>
<P>But this Fisherman escaped, by teaching them to take fish with nets, in the Sea and in fresh rivers, whereby he was ho∣noured and beloved of all.</P>
<P>The Lords of the Country fell out about him, and in 13. yeares he was there, he was sent to at least 25. of them from one to another, to teach his Art of Fishing, so that he was in all parts of the Country; which he saith, is very great, the people very rude, and voide of goodnesse, they all goe naked, neither have they wit to cover their bodies with the skins of beasts they take by hunting, whereby they are miserably vexed with cold, they have Lances, sharpe at the point, they have Bowes, and strings made of beast skins, they are a cruell people, and have certaine lawes amongst them∣selves; to Southwards the people have more civility, the aire being more temperate, and have Cities and Temples with I∣dols, there they sacrifice men to Idols, and afterwards eate them, they have some knowledge of gold and silver.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13"/>Now this Fisherman had an intent to get home, but his companions being in despaire thereof, never offered to at∣tempt their freedome, and therefore stayed there; whereupon he travailed through the woods towards <HI>Dorgio,</HI> the next Lord knew him, and he was conveyed from one to ano∣ther, untill at length he came to <HI>Dorgio,</HI> where he stayed three yeares, and hearing of divers Boates that were arri∣ved there, he went to the sea side, and asking of whence they were, they said of <HI>Estotiland,</HI> he being glad, requested to be entertained by them, and carried to their country, which they gladly granted and used him for their Interpretor.</P>
<P>After that, he frequented that trading with them and be∣came very rich, wherewith he furnished a barke, returned into <HI>Friezeland,</HI> and to his Lord made this report of that wealthy Country.</P>
<P>He is credited here, for that the Mariners doe affirme his reports to be true, wherefore this Lord is resolved to send me forth with a fleete toward these parts, but it was not so; for <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chmni</HI> went himselfe, and concerning their proceedings I have a Letter in forme following;</P>

should by a shorter tract come to <HI>India;</HI> I caused the King to be advertised of my device, who immediately caused two <HI>Caravels</HI> to be furnished, with all things needfull, which was as neere as I can remember, in the yeare 1496. In the begin∣ning of Summer, I begun to saile North-west, not thinking to find any other Land then that of <HI>Cataia,</HI> and from thence to come into <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>But after certaine dayes, I found the Land run to the North which was to me a great displeasure, neverthelesse sailing a∣long the Coast, to see if I could finde any Gulfe that turned, I found the Land still to continue continent, to the 56. Degree vnder the Pole▪ and seeing that there the Coast turned toward the East, dispairing to find the passage, I turned backe againe, and sailed downe by the Coast of that Land toward the Equi∣noctiall. <HI>Thus much from himselfe.</HI></P>
<P>But heare, how <HI>Baptistie Ramusius</HI> his Country man, how he flattereth him thus. It's many yeares, since it was written vnto me by <HI>Sebastian Cabota</HI> our Countryman a <HI>Venetian,</HI> a Man of great experience and very rare in the Art of Navigati∣on, and the knowledge of Cosmographie, who sailed along and beyond this Coast of new <HI>France,</HI> at the charges of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the 7.

<P>This Bay was named <HI>Yorke Sound:</HI> The point <HI>Bloudy Point.</HI></P>
<P>Our men returned to their Tents (seeing there was no hope to bring them to Civility) &amp; made spoile of thē; wherein they found an old shirt, a doublet, a Girdle, and shooes of the men lost the last yeare.</P>

<HEAD>Things Remarkeable in this second Voyage.</HEAD>
<P>THey are men of large Corporature, good proportion, and of colour not much unlike the Sunne-burnt Country man. They weare their haire something long, cut disorderly before, their women weare their haire long, knit up with two loopes, some of them Races their cheekes, chins, and faces, whereupon they lye a colour like darke Azure.</P>
<P>They eate all their meate Raw, as flesh, fish, fowle, or but lightly perboyled, with water and bloud they will eate Ice as we doe Suger.</P>
<P>For necessity, they will eate grasse like bruit beasts, with∣out table or stoole, and when their hands are imbrued in blood they licke them cleane with their tongues.</P>
<P>They yoke their Dogs for use, as wee doe Oxen, and when they grow old they fatten them to eate, and if they dye they doe the like.</P>
<P>They apparell themselves in skins of Beasts &amp; Fowle, sowed together with the sinewes thereof, to defend them from cold.</P>
<P>They make their apparell with hoods and tailes, which tailes they bestow as favours to ratifie any friendship showen them, the mens garments are not so long as the womens.</P>
<P>They weare their hose close to their legs, from the wast to the knee without any opening before, as well the one kind as the other, upon their legs they weare hose of leather, with the fur-side inward 3. paire at once, especially the women, in these hose they put their necessaries they carry about them, they put also a bone into their hose from the foote to the knee, where∣on their hose being drawne are held up in place of garters.</P>
<P>They dresse theyr skins very soft and supple with haire on, in winter they weare the skin-side inwards, in Sommer out∣ward, other apparell they have none.</P>
<P>Their beasts, fishes, and fowles, are all their meate, drinke, apparell, houses, bedding; and all their Riches.</P>
<P>Their houses are tents covered with skins, pitched with quarters foure square, meeting at tops sewed together with si∣newes,
<PB N="19" REF="21" MS="y"/>
their entrance is alwayes ore against the Sunne.</P>
<P>They have other sorts of houses which they found not to be inhabited, raised with stones and Whale bones, and covered with skins, the entering not unlike unto an ovens mouth, which they frequent during their hunting time, and so leaves them untill they come thither againe.</P>
<P>They have 2. sorts of Boates, the one only for one man the other for 16. men, they kill all their fish and flesh with darts, and it may be thought, they repaire to some other place to live in winter farther from the Sea side, they will eate theyr flesh and fish, smell it never so filthily, what knowledge they haue of God or what Idoll they adore is unknowne, they make signes of people that weare bright plates of Gold in their foreheads. The Country is high and mountainous, great quantity of snow lying thereon, there is little plaine ground and no grasse, but that which is like unto mosse grow∣ing upon soft ground such as we get turffe upon. There is no wood at all. There is great quantity of Deere, their skinnes like unto Asses, their heads or hornes doe farre exceed any, both in length and breadth of those Countryes, their feete are great as Oxen which measured were 7. or 8. inches in breadth, their are also Hares, Wolves, fishing-Beares, and sun∣dry sorts of Sea fowle.</P>

<P>The 2. they had sight of the Queenes <HI>Forland,</HI> they beare in all day, had much Ice, at night they were entred the Sreight all overcome with Ice; not froze there, but driven by the windes violence.

<P>And the Ice he met at Sea 1000. Miles from land, all which congealed upon fresh water; he concludes they were froze in bayes and rivers, and not in the Sea.</P>
<P>This Ice doth shut together with winde, and open at the shifting or change thereof as in other places, so as it is passable.</P>
<P>The Barke <HI>Dennis</HI> struck vpon a Rocke: The ship sunke, the men were saved by their boates; therein were much of the house drowned, which the men appointed to winter, should have lived in <HI>Meta incognita.</HI> Amidst the Ice a storme takes them at S.

<P>Here they could have no observation, the Generall sends to the Shippes to know their chiefest opinions; <HI>Christopher Hall</HI> chiefe Pylate saide, he had never seene that coast before, nor could not make it for any part of <HI>Frobrishers streights,</HI> although the land did lye and trent alike.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE></P>
<P>The 10. the weather continued thicke and darke, and the fleete disperced, they were doubtfull whether to set to Sea, or to follow a doubtfull course in a Sea, Bay, or Streight, they knew not, or stand a long an unknowne coast, where they could not discerne dangers for darke mists and thick weather.</P>
<P>Whereupon some betooke themselves to Sea, as thinking that the safest Course, others followed the Generall, within that doubtfull and unknowne Streights above 60. leagues, ha∣ving alwaies a faire Continent upon the Starboard, and a continuance of an open Sea before them, so as if it<NOTE PLACE="marg">This doth ar∣gue that this Streight doth goe through <HI>Groeneland</HI> in∣to <HI>Fretum Da∣vis.</HI></NOTE> had not beene for the gathering of his fleete againe; as also their lading of Ore, he both would and could have gone into the <HI>Mare del Sur,</HI> for the further they sailed, the lesse Ice, and 50. leagues within this Streight was none at all.</P>
<P>This streight hath also a great Indraft; for by the foresaid current, the floting wracke of the barke <HI>Dyoniss</HI> lost at the Queenes <HI>Forland,</HI> was brought thither along the Coast, and by the Indraft drawne in there, it being many miles distant.</P>
<P>They doe also affirme out of some of their best marriners observation, that in this streight, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood-tyde doth runne 9. houres, and ebbe 3. which may well come to passe by force of the current comming from the E. and butting upon that coast, may enforce the tyde into all indrafts and rivers, with longer flowings, untill the force of the ebbe, receiving his strength from the West Sea, doe resist it, the Sea will not according to the saying.</P>

<P>Now the Fleete being all laden and ready, they furnish vp a little house with Bells, Babies, Pictures of men and women, Glasses, Whissles, Pipes, with an oven with baked bread, &amp; left it to the Natives.

<P>The 20. they descryed land, the most deformed that ever was seene, it seemed like the forme of Suger loafes, over-to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ping the Clouds and covered over with snow, the shore be∣laid with Ice, a league off he names this Land <HI>Desolation.</HI></P>

<P>The 29. he meets land in 64. and in longitude from <HI>London,</HI> Meridian 58. 30. for divers reasons he beares into this known harbor, and to set up his Pinnace; he findes many goodly har∣bors, with high land little troubled with snow, and sea altoge∣ther voyd of Ice; he sends his Boats to search before the ships for shoale-water to anchor in. The Countrey people come to them with cries and shouts; but after they espied some of the Company, whom they knew before, they came to their boates and hung vpon them with great joy. The Captaine with di∣vers others goeth on Land. The people come to him with dauncing and leaping; and made signes, they knew all those that had beene there the yeare before: At this present, there were 18. of them to whom he gaue to every one a knife; they offered him skinnes, but he shewed them that he bestowed them in curtesie, and so dismist them; with signes that they should returne in 4. houres.</P>

<P>He mans his Boate attended with 50. Cannoes, intending to view the Country, the people very carefully helpe him up and downe the steepe Rockes.

<P>They also stole their Oares, a Calliver, a Boare speare, a sword, wherevpon they brake the Peace, by shooting off a Musket and a Faulcon, at which noise they all departed with great feare. They returned againe within 10. houres, to in∣treat peace which was immediately granted, they brought Seale skinnes and Salmon-peale, but seeing Iron they could not forbeare to steale; they eate their meate raw, drinke salt water, and eate grasse and yee with delight.</P>
<P>Their weapons are for the most darts; but some have Bowes and Arrowes, and Slinges, with their Nettes, made of whale-fynne, with which they doe artificially catch fish with.

<P>FRom <HI>Dartmouth</HI> with 3 Shippes, the <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the <HI>Sunne∣shine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">May 19.</NOTE> and a Clincker called the <HI>Hellen</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The 12 of <HI>Iune,</HI> there fell difference betwixt the Master of the <HI>Sunneshine,</HI> and the Marriners, for that the Seamen would goe on the Voyage a fishing, the Master would not untill he had the company of the <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> but the matter was re∣conciled, and all were content to goe to the place of Ran∣devow.</P>
<P>The 14. of <HI>Iune,</HI> they descry land high and mountainous, but did imagine themselves to be 16, or 17, leagues off.</P>
<P>The 16, they anchored in harbour, the people came accor∣ding to their olde order with crying <HI>Eliout,</HI> and shewed them Seale skinnes.</P>
<P>The 17, they make way to set up their Pinnace they brought from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The 18. hee passed about the Iland, hee found blacke Pumice-stones, and salt kerned upon the Rockes white and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt.</NOTE> glistering, this day he tooke one of the people a strong fellow.</P>
<P>The 20, the Salvages came to the Iland, where the Pinnace was set up and made ready to be lancht, and tore the two upper stroaks away from her for love of the Iron; I doubt in revenge of their prisoners, and for harme done the last yeare; but being thus much made unserviceable, it was agreed, the <HI>Elizabeth</HI> should have her to fish.</P>
<P>Now as they were ready to depart, newes was brought the

Captaine, that the ships that they were to venter their lives in (I thinke for the discovery) had at one time 300. stroakes, yet they agree to commit themselves to Gods mercy in her, rather<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Leake.</NOTE> than returne with disgrace; So they stand North-wards along the Land which they call the land of their Merchants: because the people come and traffique with them; but here they were in doubt of their Ship. I take it, the <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Sunneshine,</HI> are gone a fishing home, himselfe went N. ward into 67. 40. where they had great store of Whales and fowle, which they call <HI>Cortenous;</HI> two Canoes came to them at Sea, they cry <HI>El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out,</HI> and gives Birds for bracelets, one had a dart with a peece of Vnicorne horne; the Salvage made stay thereof vntill he saw a knife, and then he truckt; they went along with them 3.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade to be had.</NOTE> houres. The 25 came 30.

<P>They brought not above 20. skinnes, but made signes that if they would goe ashore; they should have more. <HI>Chichesa∣nege,</HI> skinnes I thinke.</P>
<P>The 30. he was in 72. deg 12 min. at midnight the Com∣passe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iune.</NOTE> set the variation 28. deg. West-ward; he Coasted this<NOTE PLACE="marg">This was the West side of <HI>Groynland.</HI></NOTE> Land which he called <HI>London</HI> Coast.</P>
<P>From the 21. to the 30. the Sea all open to the West, and North-ward the Land on Starboard E. from him, the wind shifted to the North.</P>
<P>Then he left that shore, and named the N. most part he did discover <HI>Hope Sanderson,</HI> and shaping his Course West, runne 40. leag. and better without sight of any Land.</P>
<P>The 2. he meetes with a mighty banke of Ice, West from him.

<P>16 This day at noone he was 57 deg. 35 min. and had not seene the Sunne or Moone in 76 houres before, and now had variation 11 deg.</P>
<P>18 He saw a great Iland of Ice, in the afternoon he got sight also of the Southmost part of <HI>Groenland,</HI> hee coasts this Ice to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Davi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> the North, comming sometime into black water, and present∣ly the Sea would be cleare againe; he could not game ground in 120 Fathoms, neither could hee discerne any Current, at which he reckons Cape <HI>Des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation</HI> N, N, E, 24 leagues off him.</P>

<P>The 1 of <HI>Julie</HI> was fogge and snow, the ayre very cold, hee traverst to, and againe in many overfals, but by his course hee could not discerne which way the Current set, but most like to the West, he travers'd therein 16 or 17 dayes, and could find no ground in 120 fathome.</P>

<P>9 A storme began at N, E. he cleares himselfe of the land and Ice by standing to Southwards, the storme continued, so that he stood to the Southwards in forecourse.</P>
<P>17 From the 9 to the 17, he was in traverse, and heere he heard a fearefull noyse of Ice, he had thicke weather, his roapes and sailes all frozen.</P>
<P>18 The wind N, E. extreame cold and frost, the ayre very cleere; his roapes were froze, and it froze so extreamely, that it was a maine barre to his proceedings, and destruction to his men.</P>
<P>19 He stood to Eastward, with wind N, E. and the same night his men conspired to beare up the helme, and keep him in Cabbin; they shew the reason for so doing in writing; by<NOTE PLACE="marg">A mutinie.</NOTE> good chance he understands thereof and prevents them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Reasons.</HEAD>
<P>That although it were granted, that we might winter be∣tweene 60 and 70 degrees of latitude, with safety of lives and vessels, yet it will be <HI>May</HI> next, before we can dismure them to lanch out into the Sea; and therefore if the Merchants should have purpose to proceed on the discovery of the N. W. parts of <HI>America</HI> the next yeare: you may be in the fore∣said latitude from <HI>England</HI> by the first of <HI>May,</HI> and so be furnished better with men and victuals, to passe and proceed in the foresaid action.</P>
<P>Seeing then, that you cannot assure us of a safe harbour to the Northward, wee purpose to beare up the helme for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> yet with this limitation, that if in your wisedome you
<PB N="49" REF="32"/>
shall thinke good to make any discovery (it seemeth there were some with him understood more then himselfe) either in 60, or 57 degrees, with this Northwest winde, wee will yeeld our lives with your selfe to encounter any danger, thus much wee thought needfull to signifie, as a matter builded upon reason, and not proceeding upon feare or cowardice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">This cannot bee.</NOTE></P>
<P>Then being in latitude 68 and 55 min. there was no meanes to perswade them, but they would beare up the helme, whereupon he came out of his Cabbin, to enquire who was the cause, they answered, one and all, hoysing up sayles, and directing the course South by West.</P>
<P>22 Hee sent for the chiefest of the Mutineeres, and pu∣nished<NOTE PLACE="marg">This doth not appeare that he could punish, and yet suffer them to carry the ship backe.</NOTE> them severely, this day hee came by an Iland of Ice, both ships launcht their boates, to fetch some to make fresh∣water: this Iland crackt two or three times, as though it had beene thunder-clappes, and it brake in sunder to the great danger of his boates, the one being halfe laden with Ice.</P>
<P>25 It blew hard, the course West by South, with fogge, and was in latitude 61 degrees, and 40 minutes, and findes an Inlet in this latitude.</P>
<P>27 The South-south-East wind blew very hard, with fog and raine, his course West.</P>
<P>30 The wind came in a shower to West, North-west, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> blew hard, and because the yeare was farre spent, and many men sicke in both Ships, he thought good to returne; with great hope of this Inlet to be a passage of more probability, then <HI>Davis his Straights,</HI> because he found it not pestred with<NOTE PLACE="marg">No such mat∣ter.</NOTE> Ice, and a straight of 40 leagues broad; he saith, he sayled 100 leagues West by South, into the Inlet; he saith also, he found the variation to be 35 degrees Westward, and the needle to decline, or rather incline.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Observe.</HEAD>
<P>83 Degrees and a halfe, the 5 of <HI>Julie,</HI> he was cleere off the Inlet; the 6, South-east wind and fogge, the 7, 8, and 9<SUP>th</SUP>, hee passed by many great Ilands of Ice, &amp; discovered an Iland up∣on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Here was <HI>Da∣vis.</HI></NOTE> the coast of <HI>America,</HI> latitude 55 degrees, 30 minutes.</P>
<P>14 He stood off and on this coast, from the 5, untill the 14, had some foule weather, and made some Ilands; he stands in∣to an Inlet in 56 degrees, and had good hope of a passage for divers probable reasons.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="33"/>I finde nothing more of note, but that upon the Coast of <HI>America,</HI> betwixt 55 degrees, 30 and 50 minutes, he observed two variations, the one of 17 deg. 15 min. the other 18 degr. 12 min. the coast was voyd of Ice, unlesse some great Ilands drive from the North, and that the ship had like to have pe∣rished for want of spare decks; one whirlewind he saw upon this Coast, take up the Sea into the Ayre extreamely, that hee<NOTE PLACE="marg">A whirlewind.</NOTE> was entred 30 leagues within one Inlet, latitude 56 degrees, where if the wind had come Northerly, South or East but one day, he had perished.</P>

<HEAD>Now followeth Mr. <HI>Iames Hall</HI> his Topographicall Description of the Land, as hee discovered the same.</HEAD>
<P>THe land of <HI>Groenland,</HI> is a very high ragged, and mountai∣nous Countrey, having many good Rivers, Harbours, and Bayes; into 5. of which, hee sayled 10, or 12 English leagues,
<PB N="53" REF="34"/>
being very navigable, with abundance of Fish of sundry sorts, the Land in all places where I came, seemed to bee fertile, ac∣cording to the Climate wherein it lyeth, for betweene the Mountaines was most pleasant Plaines and Vallies, insomuch as if he had not seene the same, hee would not have beleeved, that such a fertile land in shew could have bin in those Nor∣therne Regions; there is also great store of Fowle, as Ravens, Crowes, Partridges, Pheasants, Seamewes, Gulls, with other sorts; of Beasts he hath not seene any, except blacke Foxes of which there are very many. Hee doth suppose there are also many Deere, for about their tents, they found many Harts∣hornes, with the bones of other beasts, also within the land he saw the footing and dung of divers other beasts, he found the footing of one beast to be 8 inches over; in the rivers were Fishes, as Seales, Whales, and Salmon, with divers o∣ther sorts of fishes; the coast is a very good and faire land, for 3 leag. off, he found 15 fathomes, and as he approached the same 13, 12, 10 fathomes, very faire sandy ground. The peo∣ple are a kind of <HI>Samoid</HI> or wandering nation, removing from one place unto another, they are people of a reasonable sta∣ture, browne of colour, very like the people of the East and W. <HI>India,</HI> they are active and warlike, vsing their darts and slings very nimbly, they eate their meate raw, or little par∣boild, with blood, oyle or water; they apparell themselves in skinnes of such beasts as they kill, but especially with Seales and fowles, which they can dresse very soft and smooth, in Summer turning the haire and feather side outwards, in Win∣ter inwards, their weapons are slings, bowes, darts headed with bone or yron, he supposeth them to be Idolatrous, wor∣shipping the Sun, he met all the coast along much drift wood, but from whence it came he knew not, he coasted this Coast along from 66 deg. to 69 deg. and found many good sounds and harbours, and returning towards his Shippe which he found in a harbour, by espying certaine Wor∣lockes, which the Captaine had caused to be set as Beacons, for to give him knowledge of their being.</P>
<P>In this his absence from the Admirall, the Saluages had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iuly.</NOTE> done them much violence, the Captaine had taken three of of them, whom he kindly intreated, others of them he slew, this evening he takes in his provision of fresh water.</P>

<P>15 This day he was in Latitude 57 degrees; the 16 day close weather, he meetes with a mighty skull of Whales, amongst drift Ice, and meetes also a great current set∣ting West North-west over for <HI>America.

<P>HE saith, that in the Morning perceiving the Sunne, and Moone to shine very cleare, he purposed to find out the Longitude, and this day he spent in finding out the true Meridian Line vpon an Iland, by hanging at the extreames

<P>After the Governors conference with him, I came privately to demand, certaine particulars, touching the Pigmies and other things; he had a little skill in the Latine tongue, he un∣derstood me speaking Latine, but answered me by an Inter∣preter; he said the Pigmies represent the most perfect shape of man, that they were hayrie to the outermost joynts of the finger, and that the males have beards down to the knees, but although they have the shape of man, yet they have little sense, or understanding, or distinct speech, but make shew of a kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issing▪ after the manner of Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, that his Abbot kept two of them in his Monasterie, male and female, but they li∣ved not long, and that they were unreasonable creatures, and

<P>He affirmed that the same manner of food was in <HI>Groen∣land,</HI> as in <HI>Iseland;</HI> to wit, of Fish, but not of Cattell, because they have no Cattell; and that the Countrey is not populous.

<P>He stands to the W. along the S. shoare and raised 3 Capes or headlands one above another, the middlemost is an Iland, with a Bay which he thinkes will prove a good harbour, he names them Prince <HI>Henries Forland,</HI> when he had laid these, he raised another which was the extreame part of the land looking towards the N. upon it are two hils (but one above the rest) like an humlocke, he names it King <HI>Iames his Cape,</HI> to the N. of this lyes certaine Ilands, he names it Queen <HI>Annes Forland,</HI> he still followed the N. shoare beyond the <HI>Kings For∣land,</HI> there is a Bay wherein lyeth some broken land and close to the maine, but he passed by on the night.</P>

<P>Thus going from place to place, they see (to the West) a Hill higher then all the rest, it was steepe, and they could not get vp to it, but on the South-west side; and on that side was a great water pond, from whence on the South runneth a streame of water, as much as would drive a Mill, falling into the Sea: and in this place bred great store of Fowle, and the best grasse grew there, they had seene since their comming from <HI>England,</HI> they found Sorrell and Scurvey-grasse in great aboundance, they found likewise Hills, made like to hay∣cockes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowle hanged.</NOTE> within which were great store of Fowle hanged by the neckes, they tooke many of them; and downe a valley carried them to their Boate.</P>

<P>From thence, he passed to the N. but some 2 or 3 dayes af∣ter, there fell some reasoning concerning their comming into this Bay and going out, the Master takes occasion to reviue old matters, and displaces his Mate <HI>Robert Ivet,</HI> and also his Boate-swaine, for words spoken in the great Bay of Ice; he places <HI>Robert Bylot</HI> his Mate, and <HI>William Wilson</HI> Boate-swaine, and then stands vp to the N, vntill he raised land, and then downe to the S. then vp againe to the N. and then downe to<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Michaelmas</HI> Bay.</NOTE> the S. and on <HI>Michaelmas</HI> day he came in and went out from certaine Ilands which he sets downe for <HI>Michalmas</HI> Bay; from thence he stood to the N. and came into shole water, the wea∣ther thicke and foule.</P>
<P>He anchored in 6 or 7 fadomes, and lay there 8 dayes, before which time he could not have one houre to get vp his anchor, the winde then ceasing, the Master would have vp the an∣chor, against the mind of all that knew what belonged there∣vnto; but when he had his anchor on peake, the Ship tooke one sea and threw them all from Capstone, and diuers were hurt, he left his anchor and saved most of his Cable, for the Carpenter had laid his axe ready to cut the Cable if occasion should so fall out.</P>
<P>From hence he stands to S, W. through a cleare Sea of di∣vers soundings, and came to a Sea of two coulours, one blacke the other white, and 16 or 17 fadom water, betweene which he went 5 or 6 leag. the night comming on, he goes in his maine and fore-saile and came into 5 or 6 fathomes, he saw no land for it was darke, so that he stood to the East, and had<NOTE PLACE="marg">The West most of <HI>Hadsons</HI> Bayes.</NOTE> deeper water, and then stood to the S. and S.

<P>He then stood up to the East and raised 3 hils lying North and South, he went to the furthermost, and left it to the North he came into a Bay and anchored, and sent the Carpenter, and this writer to looke for a place to winter; it being the last of <HI>October;</HI> the nights long and cold, the earth all covered with Snow, themselves wearied, having spent 3 moneths in a laby∣rinth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> in this Bay, they went downe to the East, to the bot∣tome there, but returned not with that they went for; the next day he went to the South, and S, West, where he found a place, unto which hee brought his ship, and hailed her on ground, and on the 10 day she was froze in; now hee lookes to the lengthning of his provision.</P>
<P>He was victualled for 6 moneths with good provision and might have had more from home if he would, now hee must pinch for that he knew of no supply untill he came the next yeere to Cape <HI>Digs,</HI> where the Fowle breed, for there was all his hopes; wherefore hee propounded reward to him that either killed beast, fish, or fowle; his Gunner dyed about the middle of this moneth, he blameth the Masters uncharitable dealing with this man, but note what followed.</P>
<P>The Master kept in his house at <HI>London,</HI> a young man na∣med<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Henry Greenes</HI> condition.</NOTE> <HI>Henry Greene,</HI> borne in <HI>Kent,</HI> of worthy Parents, but by his life and conversation, he had lost the love of all his friends, &amp; spent all that he had, but by the means of one Master <HI>Venson,</HI> his mother parted with 4 l. to buy him cloathes, which money he was not trusted with the disposing of himselfe, this <HI>Henry Greene,</HI> was not knowne to the Adventurers, nor had any wa∣ges, but came onely on board at <HI>Graves-end,</HI> and at <HI>Harwich,</HI> would have gone into the field with one <HI>Wilkinson</HI> of our Company; at <HI>Island</HI> he fell out with the Chirurgion in <HI>Dutch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Green</HI> beats the Surgion.</NOTE> and he beat him on shore in <HI>English,</HI> which set all the Com∣pany in a rage, so that they had much adoe to get the Chirur∣gion on board againe, this Author told the Master of it, but he bade him let the matter alone; for (said he) the Chirur∣gion hath a tongue that would wrong the best friend he had, but <HI>Robert Iuet,</HI> the Masters Mate would needs put his fin∣gers
<PB N="79" REF="47"/>
in the Embers, and told the Carpenter a long tale, (when he was drunke) that the Master had brought in <HI>Greene</HI> to cracke his credit that should displease him, which when the Master heard of, (being forty leagues from <HI>Island</HI>) he would have gone backe to <HI>Island</HI> to have sent <HI>Juet</HI> his Mate home in a Fisherman, but being otherwise perswaded, all was well and <HI>Greene</HI> stood upright, and was very inward with the Master, and was a serviceable man every way for manhood, but for Religion he would say he was white Paper, whereon he might write what he would; now the Gunner was dead, and then (as order is in such cases) if the Company stand in neede of any thing belonged to the man that is deceas∣sed, then is it brought to the maine Mast, and there sold to them that will give the most for it; this Gunner, had a gray cloth Gowne, which <HI>Greene</HI> prayed the Master to befriend him, so much as to let him have it, paying for it as another would give, the Master said he should, and therefore answe∣red some, who sought for it that <HI>Greene</HI> should have it and none else.</P>
<P>Now out of time and season, the Master called the Carpen∣ter to goe in hand with a house on shore, which at the be∣ginning hee would not heare of, when it might have beene done; the Carpenter told him that the Snow and Frost was such, as hee neither could nor would goe in hand with such worke, which when he heard he feretted him out of his cab∣bine and struck him, calling him by many foule words and threatned to hang him, the Carpenter tolde him, that he knew what belonged to his place better then he did, and that he was no house Carpenter, yet the house was made with much labour to no end, the next day after, the Master and the Car∣penter fell out, the Carpenter tooke his Peece and <HI>Henry Greene</HI> with him, for it was ordered that none should goe out alone, but one with a Peece another with a Pike, this did move the Master so much more against <HI>Greene,</HI> that <HI>Robert Bylot</HI> his mate must have the Gowne, and had it delivered unto him, which <HI>Henry Greene</HI> seeing, he charged the M<SUP>r</SUP>. with his pro∣mise, but the M<SUP>r</SUP>. did so raile on <HI>Greene,</HI> &amp; with so many words of disgrace, telling him that all his friends durst not trust him with 20 shillings, &amp; therfore why should he, and as for wages he was to have none, nor should if he did not please him, yet
<PB N="100" REF="48"/>
the M<SUP>r</SUP>. had promised him as good wages as any man in the ship, and to have him one of the Princes <HI>Guard</HI> at his home cō∣ming, but you shall see how the Divell so wrought out of this that <HI>Greene</HI> did the Master what mischiefe he could, in seek∣ing<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Greene</HI> prac∣tise of mischeif.</NOTE> to discredit him, and to thrust him and other honest men out of the ship; to speake of all the troubles, and of this cold Winter would be too tedious.</P>
<P>Now he sheweth how mercifully God dealt with them in this time, for in the space of three moneths he had such store of one kinde of Fowle, which were Partridge, as white as Milke, at which he killed at least one hundred dozen, of sun∣dry sorts, for all was fish that came to the net, at the Spring this fowle left them, and in their places came other of divers sorts, as Swannes, Goose, Ducke, and Teale, but hard to come by, he thought that they would have bred there in those broken grounds, but they doe not, but came from the S, and flew to the N. further then he was this Voyage, yet if they had beene taken short with N. or N. E. winds, they stay there a∣gainst the winds returne, and then take their flight to the N. ward, and in short time none of them are to be seene there.</P>
<P>Then he searched the wooddy hils and vallies, for all things<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miserable food.</NOTE> that had any show of substance (for food) how vile soever, the mosse of the ground, and the frog in his ingendring time was not spared, but amongst divers sorts of buds, it pleased God that <HI>Thomas Woodhouse</HI> brought one of a tree, that was full of Turpentine substance, of this the Surgion made a decoc∣tion<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Medecinable bud.</NOTE> to drinke, and applyed the buds hot to them that were troubled with ache in any part, from whence they received present ease.</P>
<P>Now about that time the Ice began to breake out of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Salvage▪</NOTE> bayes, there came a <HI>Salvage</HI> to their Ship, as it were to see and to be seene, and was the first, that they had seen in all that time, he intreats him well, and used him kindly, promising to him∣selfe great matters by this meanes; and therefore called for all the Knives and hatchets which every man had to his private vse, and to this <HI>Salvage</HI> he gave a knife, a looking-glasse, and buttons, who received them thankefully, and made signes that after he had slept he would come againe, which he did and brought with him a sled which he drew after him, and up∣on it two Deere skins, and two Beaver skinnes, he had a scrip

under his arme, out of which he drew those things the Master had given him; and layes the knife upon the Beaver skinnes, and the glasses and buttons upon the other, and so gave them to the Master, who received them; and the <HI>Salvage</HI> tooke<NOTE PLACE="marg">They trade.</NOTE> those things which the Master had given him, and put them into his scrip againe, then the Master showed him a hatchet, for which he would have given him one of his Deere skins, but the Master would have both, and so he had, although not willingly, after many signes of people to the N. and to the S. and that after so many sleepes, he would come again, he went his way but came no more.</P>
<P>Now the Ice being broke out of the Sounds, that a boate might passe, the M<SUP>r</SUP>. appointed <HI>William Wilson, Henry Greene, Michael Peirce, John Thomas, Andrew Motter, Bennet Ma∣thewes,</HI> and <HI>Arnold Lodlo,</HI> to go on fishing, these men the first day they went, caught 500. fish as bigge as good Herrings, and some Trouts, here was good hope to have their want<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishing.</NOTE> supplyed, but those were the most that ever they got in one day, for many dayes they got not a quarter so many; in this time of their fishing, <HI>Henry Greene,</HI> and <HI>William Wilson,</HI> with some others plotted to take the net &amp; Shallop which the Car∣penter had new set up, and so to shift for themselves, but the Shallop being ready, the Master would goe in it himselfe, to the S, and S, W, to see if he could meete with people, for to that end it was set up: and that way he could see the woods set on fier by them; the Master takes the net and shallop, and so much victuals as would serve for nine dayes, and went to the Southward, they that remained on board were appointed to take in water, wood, and ballast; and to make the ship rea∣dy against his returne; but he could set no time, for hee was perswaded that if he met with the Salvages, hee should have refreshing of fresh meat, and that good store; but in conclusi∣on, he returned worse then he went, and though the Inhabi∣tants set the woods on fire before him, yet they would not come to him.</P>

The cause why the Master delivered all the cheese, was because they were not all of one goodnesse, and therefore they should see that they had no wrong done them, but that every man had the best and worst together, which was 3 pound and one halfe for 7 dayes.</P>
<P>The wind serving, he wayed and stands to the N, W. and on Munday night, the 18 of <HI>June,</HI> he fell into the Ice, and the next day with W. wind he lay fast within sight of land untill Sunday following; now being here the Master told <HI>Nicholas Simmes</HI> that there would be a breaking up of Chests, and a search for bread, and willed him, if he had any to bring it to him, which he did, and delivered the Master 30 Cakes in a bag; this deed of the M<SUP>r</SUP>.

were at: and that there they lay, the Master not caring to go one way or other; and that they had not eaten any thing this three dayes, and therefore were resolute either to mend o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> end, and what they had begun, they would go through there∣with, or die; when he heard this, he told them, he marvelled to heare so much from them, considering that they were mar∣ried men, and had wives and children, and that for their sakes they should commit so foule a thing in the sight of God and man, as that would be: for why should they banish them∣selves from their native countrey; <HI>Henry Greene</HI> bad him hold his peace, for he knew the worst of it; which was to be hanged when he came at home, and therefore of the two he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hang or starve</NOTE> would rather be hanged at home then starved abroad, and for the good will they bore him they would have him to stay in the ship; he gave them thankes, and told them that hee came into the ship, not to forsake her, nor yet to hurt himselfe and others by any such deed, <HI>Henry Greene</HI> told him then, that hee must take his fortune in the Shallop, if there bee no remedy quoth he, the will of God he done.</P>
<P>Away goes <HI>Greene</HI> in a rage, swearing to cut his throat that went about to disturbe them, and left <HI>Wilson</HI> by him, with whom he had some conference, but to no good, for hee was perswaded to goe on with the action, whilst it was hot, lest their parties should faile them; and the mischiefe they inten∣ded to others, should fall upon their owne shoulders. <HI>Greene</HI> comes againe and demaunded what he said; <HI>Wilson</HI> answe∣red and said, he is in his old song, still patient; then he spake to <HI>Greene</HI> to stay 3 dayes, in which time hee would so deale with the M<SUP>r</SUP>. as all should bee well, but being denied, he dealt with him but for 2 dayes, nay, for 12 houres, there is no way then say they, but out of hand: then he told them that if they would stay while Munday▪ he would joine with them to share all the victuals in the ship▪ and would justifie it when he came at home; but this would not serve, wherefore he told them it was some worse matter they had in hand, then they made shew of, and that it was blood and revenge he sought or else he would not undertake such a deed, at such a time of night, <HI>Greene</HI> with that tooke his Bible, which lay before him, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sweare.</NOTE> sware that he would doe no harme, and what he did, it was for the good of the Voyage, and for nothing else, and that all the rest should doe the like, the like did <HI>Wilson</HI> sweare.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="50"/><HI>Greene</HI> went his way, and presently comes <HI>Ivett,</HI> who be∣cause hee was an ancient man, he hoped to have found some reason in him, but he was worse then <HI>Greene,</HI> for hee swore plainely that he would justifie this deed at home-comming, after him came, <HI>Iohn Thomas,</HI> and <HI>Michael Pierce,</HI> as birds of one feather, but because they died, as hereafter shall be shew∣ed, he let them passe; then came <HI>Motter</HI> and <HI>Bennet,</HI> of whom he demaunded, if they were well advised what they had taken in hand, they answered, they were, and therefore came to take their oath.</P>
<P>Now saith this writer, because he was much condemned for this oath, as one that plotted with them, and that by an oath he should binde them together to performe what they had begun; he thought good to set downe to the view of all men, to see how well their oath and deeds agreed, and thus it was; <HI>You shall be true to God, your Prince and Countrey, you shall doe nothing but to the glory of God, and to the good of the action in hand, and harme to no man.</HI> This was the oath without adding or diminishing, he looked for moe of those companions, al∣thoughthose were too many, but there came no more while it was darke, and they in readinesse to put this deed of darkenesse into execution, he called to him <HI>Greene</HI> and <HI>Wilson,</HI> and prayed them not to goe in hand with it in the darke, but to stay untill morning, for now he hoped every man would goe to his rest, but wickednesse sleepeth not: for <HI>Henry Greene</HI> keepeth the Master Company all night, and gave this writer bread, which his Cabbin mate gave him, and others were as watchfull as hee; then he asked <HI>Henry Greene,</HI> whom he would put out with the Master, he said the Carpenter, <HI>Iohn King,</HI> and the sick men, he said they should not doe well to part with the Car∣penter, what need soever they should have; why, the Car∣penter was in no more regard amongst them, then another, for that he and <HI>John King</HI> were condemned for wrong done in the victuals; but the chiefest cause was because the Master loved him, and made him his mate, upon this his returne from his wintring place, thereby displacing <HI>Robert Bylot,</HI> who they did grudge because hee could neither write nor reade; for therefore said they, the Master and his ignorant mate will carry the ship whether the Master pleaseth; the Master ha∣ving forbidden any man to keepe account or reckoning
<PB N="105" REF="50"/>
having taken from all men whatsoever served for that pur∣pose; well, he obtained of <HI>Henry Greene</HI> and <HI>Wilson,</HI> that the Carpenter should stay, by which meanes, after that they had satisfied themselves, the Master and the rest might bee taken into the ship againe, or hee hoped that some one or other would give some notice to the Carpenter, <HI>Iohn King,</HI> or the Master; for so it might have come to passe, and have beene by some of them prevented, that were the most for∣ward.</P>
<P>Now it cannot be amisse to shew how they were lodged, and to begin in the cookes Roome, there lay <HI>Bennet,</HI> and the Cooper lame without the Cookes roome, on the starboard side lay <HI>Thomas Woodhouse</HI> sicke, next to him lay <HI>Sydrach Fen∣ner</HI> lame, then lay <HI>Wilson</HI> the boatswaine, and then <HI>Arnold Lod∣lo</HI> next to him, in the Gunners roome lay <HI>Robert Iuet</HI> and <HI>John Thomas,</HI> on the Larboard side lay <HI>Michaell But,</HI> and <HI>Adiran Moore</HI> which was never well since they lost their anckor, next to him lay <HI>Michaell Peirce</HI> and <HI>Andrew Motter,</HI> next to them, without the Gunner roome lay <HI>Iohn King,</HI> and with him <HI>Robert Bilot,</HI> next to them himselfe, and next to him <HI>Francis Clements,</HI> In the midship betwixt the Capstone and the Pompes, <HI>Henry Greene,</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Simmes,</HI> this night <HI>John King</HI> was late up, and they thought he had beene with the Mr. but he was with the Carpenter, who lay in the poope, and comming from him was met by his cabbine mate, as it were by chance, so they went to cabbine together, it was not long ere it was day, then came <HI>Bennet,</HI> for water for the ket∣tle, he went into the hold, when he was in, they shut the hatch on him, but who kept it downe he knoweth not, but upon the decke came <HI>Bennet.</HI></P>
<P>In the meane time went <HI>Henry Greeene</HI> and another to the Carpenter, and held him talke, untill the Master came out of his Cabbin, which hee soone did, then came <HI>John</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Master bound.</NOTE> <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Bennet,</HI> before him, while <HI>Wilson</HI> bindes his armes behind him, he asked what they meant, they told him that he should know when hee was in the Shallop; now <HI>Iuet,</HI> while this was doing, came to <HI>John King</HI> into the hold, who<NOTE PLACE="marg">King liked one.</NOTE> was provided for him, for hee had got a sword of his owne and kept him at a Bay, and might have killed him but others came to helpe him, and so he came up to the Ma∣ster,

the Master called to the Carpenter, and tolde him that he was bound, but he heard no answer made, now <HI>Arnold Lod∣lo,</HI> and <HI>Michell But,</HI> railed at them and told them there kna∣very would show it selfe, then was the Shallop hailed up to the ship side, and the poore sicke and lame men, were called up to get them into the Shallop, the Master called to this writer who came out of his cabbine, as well as he could, to the hatch way to speake with him, where on his knees he besought them for the love of God to remember themselves, and to do as they would be done unto, they bad him keep himselfe well and get him into his cabbine, not suffering the Master to speak to him; but when he came into his cabbin againe, at the horn window which gave light into his cabbine, the Mr. told him that <HI>Juet</HI> would overthrow them all; nay said he, it is that vil∣laine <HI>Greene,</HI> and spake it not softly.</P>
<P>Now was the Carpenter at liberty, and asked them if they would be hanged when they came at home, and as for him∣selfe, he said he would not stay in the Ship unlesse they would force him, they bid him go then, for they would not stay him, I will said he, so I may have my chest and all that is in it, they said he should, and presently put it into the Shallop, then came he to take his leave of this writer, who perswaded him to stay, which if he would he might so worke that all might be well, but he answered, that he did not thinke but that they would be glad to take them in againe, for he was so perswaded by the Master, that there was not one in all the ship that could tell how to carry her home, but saith he, if we must part (which we will not willingly doe, for they would follow the ship) prayed him if they came to the Cape before them, that he would leave some token, that he had beene there neare to the place where the Fowles breed, and he would doe the like for us, and so with teares we parted, now were the sick men driven out of their cabbines into the Shallop but <HI>Iohn Thomas,</HI> who was <HI>Francis Clements</HI> friend, and <HI>Bennet,</HI> was the Coo∣pers, so as there was words betweene them and <HI>Henry Greene,</HI> saying that they should goe, and the other swearing that they should not goe, but such as were in the Shallop should returne when <HI>Henry Greene</HI> heard that, he was compelled to give place and to put out <HI>Arnold Lodl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Michael But,</HI> which with much a doe they did.</P>

<P>The Boat went to <HI>Diggs</HI> Cape, and made directly for the place where the Fowle breed, where they see 7.

<P>They made haste to be on shore, and because the Ship rid farre off, they weighed and stood as neere the place where the Fowle breed as they could; and because he, this Writer was lame, he was to goe into Boat to carry such things as he had in the Cabbine, of every thing some what; And so with more hast then good speed (and not without swearing) away he went; as <HI>Henry Greene, William Wilson, John Thomas, Mi∣chael Pierce, Andrew Motter,</HI> and himselfe. When they came neere the shore, the people were on the hills dancing and lea∣ping; to the Cove we came, where they had drawn up their Boats.

This Writer made signes unto him to get him ou shore: but he made as though he had not understood him: whereupon he stood up and pointed him on shore. In the meane time another stole behind to the sterne of the Boat; and when he saw him on shore that was on the Boats head, hee sate downe againe, but suddenly hee sawe the leggs and feete of a man by him; wherefore hee cast up his head and

<P>Whilst he was thus assaulted in the Boat, their men were set upon on the shore, <HI>John Thomas</HI> and <HI>William Wilson</HI> had their bowells cut; and <HI>Michael Pierce</HI> and <HI>Henry Greene</HI> be∣ing mortally wounded came tumbling into the Boat toge∣ther.

Now <HI>Michael Pierce</HI> had got an Hatchet, with which hee stroke one that hee lay sprawling in the Sea. <HI>Henry Greene</HI> cried <HI>coragi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and laid a∣bout him with Trunchion; this Writer cryeth to cleere the Boats head, and <HI>Andrew Motter</HI> cryeth to bee taken in; the Salvages betake them to their Bowes and Arrowes, which they sent so amongst them, that <HI>Henry Greene</HI> was slaine out∣right,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Greene</HI> slaine.</NOTE> and <HI>Michael Pierce</HI> received many wounds, and so did the rest. <HI>Michael Pierce</HI> cleareth the Boat and put it from the shore, and helpeth <HI>Andrew Motter</HI> in: but in the clearing of the Boat <HI>Pricket</HI> received a cruel wound on his back with an Arrow. <HI>Michael Pierce</HI> and <HI>Motter</HI> rowed away the Boat; which when the Salvages sawe, they came to their Boats; which they feared they would have lanched to have followed
<PB N="113" REF="54"/>
them, but they did not; their Ship was in the middle of the Channell, and yet could not see them all this time.</P>
<P>Now when they had rowed a good way from the shore <HI>Pierce</HI> fainted, and could rowe no more: then was <HI>Motter</HI> dri∣ven to stand in the Boats head and wave to the Ship, which at first sawe them not; and when they did, they could not tell what to make of them, but in they stood for them, and so tooke them up. <HI>Greene</HI> was throwne into the Sea, the rest was taken into the Ship, the Salvage being yet alive, but without sence. That day dyed <HI>Wilson</HI> cursing and swearing in most fearefull manner, <HI>Michael Pierce</HI> lived two dayes and then<NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of 4. wicked men.</NOTE> dyed. Thus have you had the tragicall end of <HI>Greene</HI> and his 3. Mates, being the lustiest men in all the Ship.</P>
<P>The poore number that was left was to ply the Ship to and againe in the mouth of the Straits, for there was no ancho∣ring; and besides, they were to goe in the Boat to kill Fowle to bring them home, which they did with great danger; for if the winde blew, there was an high Sea: and the Eddie of the tide would carry the Ship so neere the Rocks, as it feared the Master, for so now they call By lot.</P>
<P>After which great labour, and on the South Cape they had killed 300. Fowle, they stood to the East: but the wind came<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three hun∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Fowles killed.</NOTE> East, and put them back againe to the Capes where they kil∣led 100.

<P>They lie a trye all night, and the next day the fogge conti∣nues, they seeke for ground to anchor in, but found none un∣der 100. Fathoms. The next day he weighed againe and stood to the East, and now they are brought to the allowance of halfe a Fowle a day, yet they had some meatleft, and nothing else; and now were glad to burne of the feathers (for sowing
<PB N="114" REF="55"/>
of the skins, which before they sleaed off the Fowle) because they will not pull, nor the garbidge also was not throwne away.</P>
<P>He saith that after they were cleare of those Ilands which lie out with two points, one on the South East, and the other on the North, making a Bay to the sight, as if there were no way through, hee continued his course East South East, and South East, thinking to raise desolations, from thence to shape his course from <HI>Ireland,</HI> though <HI>Ivet</HI> perswaded to goe for <HI>New-found-land,</HI> hoping there to have reliefe amongst our Countrymen: but in Latitude 57. degrees, the winde came South West, and so it was thought fit to seek for food where some grew: <HI>viz Ireland,</HI> and so the course was directed; In which time they were fain to frie their Fowles bones in Can∣dle<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowles Bones fryed for meate.</NOTE> tallow, putting vinegar thereto which was stirred a∣mongst them, and every man had one pound of Candles al∣lowed for one weeke as a great dainty. And when <HI>Rob.

<P>Then <HI>Robert Juet</HI> dyed, and the rest despaired, and said they were past <HI>Ireland;</HI> their last Fowle was in Stepetub, and the men cared not what end went first. The Master was glad to doe their labour and his owne, tackling going to wrack, and none regarding to helpe the same. In this extremity it pleased God to give them sight of Land; not farre from the place where the Master said they should fall, which was the Bay of <HI>Galloway</HI> to the West of the Derses; so they stood a∣long to the South W. and espied a saile which was a Boat off <HI>Foye</HI> at anchor fishing; this Barke brought them into Beare<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beare Haven in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> Haven; here they stayed some few dayes and dealt with the Irish for Reliefe, but found none: for in that place there was neither bread, drink, nor money, or Country men which were then on fishing, they found as could in kindnsse, that they would doe nothing without present money. In the end <HI>John Waymouth</HI> one of the Barke brought them in and furnished them with money upon pawne of their best Anchor and Ca∣ble, wherewith they brought Bread, Beare, and Beefe.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="55"/>Now as they were beholding to <HI>Waymouth,</HI> so were they beholding to Captaine <HI>Tayler</HI> for making their Contracts, and for their mens wages, who would not goe with them home, except <HI>Waymouth</HI> would passe his word; Whereupon <HI>Taylor</HI> swore he would presse them; and if they would not goe he would hang them.</P>
<P>In conclusion, they agreed for 3. pound 10. shillings a man to bring the Ship to <HI>Plimouth</HI> or <HI>Phalmouth,</HI> and to give the Pilot 5. pound; and if they were put into <HI>Bristow,</HI> they were to have 4. li. 10. s. a Man, and the Pilot 6. li. and omitting fur∣ther circumstance, they came to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> from thence to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arive at <HI>Pli∣mouth.</HI></NOTE> the Downes, from thence to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and so to <HI>London;</HI> where the Master had this Writer to Sir <HI>Thomas Smiths.</HI></P>

<P>THE 10. of September 1610. after dinner our Master cal∣led all the company together, to heare and beare witn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse of the abu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of some of the company; it having beene the re∣quest of <HI>Robert Iuet,</HI> that the Master should redresse some abu∣ses and slaunders as he called them, against this <HI>Iuet,</HI> which thing after the Master had examined, and heard with equitie what hee could say for himselfe, there were proved so many great abuses and mutinous matters against the Master, and action by <HI>Ivet,</HI> that there was danger to have suffered them longer: and it was fit time to punish and cut off further occa∣sions of the like motives.</P>
<P>It was first proved to his face by <HI>Bennet Mathew,</HI> our Trum∣peter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inets</HI> mutinies.</NOTE> upon our first sight of Island: and hee confest that hee suppos'd that in the account would bee man-slaughter, and prove bloody to some.</P>
<P>Secondly, at our comming from Island, in the hearing of the company, hee did threaten to turne the Ship head home, from the action, which at that time was wisely pacefied by the Master, in hope of amendment.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it was deposed by <HI>Phillip Staffe</HI> our Capenter, and <HI>Arnold Lodlo</HI> to his face upon the holy Bible, that he perswa∣ded them to keepe Muskets charged, and Swords ready in their Cabbines, for they should be charged with shot ere the voyage were over.</P>
<P>Fourthly, we being pestered in the Ice, he had used many words tending to mutinie, discouragement, and slaunder of the action, which easily tooke effect in those that were ti∣merous: And had not the Master in time prevented, it might
<PB N="117" REF="56"/>
easily have overthrowne the voiage, and now lately being imbayed in a deepe Bay, which the Master had desire to see, for some reasons to himselfe knowne, his words tended al∣together to put the company into a fright of extremity, by ventring in cold, jesting at our Masters hope to see <HI>Bancum</HI> by Candlemas.</P>
<P>For those and divers other base slaunders against the Ma∣ster,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ivet displac'd.</NOTE> he was deposed, and <HI>Robert Bylot</HI> who had shewed him∣selfe honestly, respecting the good of the voyage, was placed Masters Mate in his stead.</P>
<P>Also, <HI>Francis Clements</HI> the Boateswaine, at that time was put from his office, and <HI>William Wilson</HI> a man thought more fit preferred to his place: this man had▪ basely carried himselfe to our. Master, and to the action.</P>
<P>Also, <HI>Adrian M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter</HI> was appointed Boatswaines mate, and a promise from the Master, that from this day <HI>Iuets</HI> wa∣ges should remaine to <HI>Bylot,</HI> and the Bosons overplus of wa∣ges should be equally devided, between <HI>Wilson</HI> and <HI>Iohn King,</HI> to the owners good liking, and one of the quarter Masters, who had very well carried themselves to the furtherance of the businesse.</P>
<P>Also, the Master promised, that if the offenders yet beha∣ved themselves honestly, he would be a meanes for their good and that hee would forget injuries, with other admonitions.</P>

<P>He departed about the beginning of May, and went by the West, and entered the passage on the South of <HI>Resolution,</HI> and sometime was fast amongst the Ice: but at length he came to <HI>Diggs</HI> his Iland, where hee staied 8. dayes; and in that time<NOTE PLACE="marg">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Diggs.</HI></NOTE> set up a Pinnace he had brought from home with him in pie∣ces; and they set from thence to the Westward, where hee discovered the Land he called <HI>Carys Swansnest;</HI> From thence he proceeded to the Southward of the West, falling with land in Latitude about 60. d. 40. with the named <HI>Hopes-check.</HI> I thinke because that there his expectation was crossed, and thereabout enduring a grievous storme, was put to the South∣ward, and constrained to looke for harbour the 13. of August, to repaire some losses. After which time came on the new Winter with much stormie weather, as he was constrained to winter there, in a small Rile or Creeke on the North side of a River in Lat. 57. d. 10. which River he named <HI>Port Nelson,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Port <HI>Nelson.</HI></NOTE> after the name of his Master (whom he buried there) putting his smal Ship in the foremost and Baracadoe both them (with Piles of Firre and earth) from storme of Snow, Ice, Raine, Floods, or what else might fall.</P>
<P>He wintered in his Ship, and kept 3. sires all the Winter: but lost many men, and yet was supplied with great store of white Partridges, and other Fowle, of which I have heard it credibly reported, that this company killed 1800. dozen in the Winter season.</P>

<P>What I received from Sir <HI>Thomas Roe,</HI> was an Abstract co∣py taken out of Sir <HI>Thomas Buttons</HI> owne Iournall, being at his returne to this <HI>Hopes Checkt,</HI> and not before: As from the beginning of his Voyage, or his wintring. I have nothing but by report, and thus he proceeded from thence.</P>
<P>15. This day being there he plyed up with contrary winds, and fogg having diversity of depth, altogether standing East∣wards of sometimes to 30. Faddome and more, and standing in to 7. or 6 m. thus travercing and anckoring, untill the 23. day, finding the Tyde to come from N. E. by N. which is an especiall argument that the land doth lye so, and not any thing else of note.</P>
<P>23 Having thus plyed up to the N. E. wards untill this day, and standing into the shore, hee anckored for to try the tyde, thinking to send his Boate on Land, to see what Land it should be: it bare on him from the N. E. by N. to the N. W. by N. and the depth 42. Fadome not above 4. ½. League from the Land, this was the highest land hee had seene, since hee came from Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs</HI> his Iland, the last yeare this Land he named <HI>Hopes Advance.</HI></P>
<P>24. This morning proved thick easie winde, and it fell to lighten and thunder, so as hee held it not fit to adventure the Boat from the Ship.</P>
<P>25. He stood of from midnight until this day 10. leagues N. E. by N. to anchor: but he saith the winde was N. E. by N. the ground was more even in standing off, and on then before, he stood off 4. leagues more into 87. Fathom.</P>
<P>This evening at the Sunnes setting, he took him with two severall Instruments, and found him to goe downe 33. d. to
<PB N="124" REF="60"/>
the W. off North by one, and by the other 30. d. they tooke the middest betwixt both.</P>
<P>26 After midnight he stood in againe N. N. W. 5. leagues, the wind came to the S. W. the weather faire and cleare, and the best he had since he came from his wintering place: about 9. this morning he sees land; it bore on him from the N. E. by North, to the N. W. by North, about 8. or 9. leagues off at noone hee steered to the Easterne point, to get hold thereof, and had a good observation in 62. d. 42. m. and his depth 74. fathoms; <HI>who will protract this Voyage to try whether this</HI> ut ultra <HI>proved a Bay or no, must begin here, and proceed to</HI> Carys Swans nest.</P>
<P>From this noone untill midnight he stood N. E. by N. 18. leagues with much winde and goowne Sea.</P>
<P>From midninght being in 15. fathoms: the weather hazy, the winde S. W. he stood off N. E. by North 12. leagues, till noone; seeing the weather like to be bad, and at 3. in the mor∣ning; he found his depth not answerable to his expectation, for he had but 25. fathom, and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. past 3. 21. fathom; hee stood S. E. till 4. that morning, and had 30. fathom.</P>
<P>27. About 6. this morning hee gave order to take in his Skiffe; the weather clearing, he saw land N. and by E. about 5. leagues off, and was as the other land that hee last sawe something higher; and having edged in with the land, from this mor∣ning 6. untill noone, the land was N. E. and by E. from him.</P>
<P>From noone untill 6. in the evening, he steered E. one point without the land 4. leagues; at 6. he anchored 32. fathom. It was then slake water; for at 8. came a strong set from N. by E. at 11, the winde S. S. W. and blew much, hee weighed and stood away N. E. with his Fore and Mision Sayles.</P>
<P>28 At midnight he put out all sayles and stood N. E. away 4. leagues, untill morning 4, having depth then 73. fathom, he edged in N. and N. and by E. upon that tyre, hee found the night before, and runne from this morning 4. untill noone, 6. leagues N somewhat Easterly.</P>
<P>This noone with bould winde S. he loost up for the shore<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not certayne whether flood or ebbe at this time.</NOTE> to get an oppertunity, if possibly, to send his Boat on land to have found which had beene the flood, and which the ebbe: but when he came within 2. leagues of shore, hee found the Bay all broken ground, and the Sea full of breaches a good
<PB N="125" REF="60"/>
way off the shore, and some within one mile under his Lee.</P>
<P>The weather growing suddenly very thick, he came to an anchor at one a clock in the afternoone, and sent the Boat on Land: but they had not beene from him halfe a Glasse, but it grew so thick, that he caused Muskets to bee shot to call the Boat back againe, at the end of 5. Glasses they returned, say∣ing, that having rode halfe an houre at anchor, they could discerne no tyde, no more could he in the Ship. In this place it is a Bay full of small Iles neere the shore under the high land; and as he rode bore on him N. N. E. Easterly, and S. W. at clock 4. the winde began to blow very much; hee wayed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Began here to protract and finde whether it bee a Bay or me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> and stands E. N. E. of with a <HI>S. S.</HI> W. winde untill 6. that night the winde encreasing to a great storme, he takes in his maine and top sayles, and stands away E. N. E. with a foresayle, at 8. a clock he had 63. fathom, and so standing one houre longer, it began to shoald contrary to expectation, he came into 50. fathom for that to fore running Eastward, hee alwaies depe∣ned his water, which now shoalding he edged of E. till mid∣night, &amp; they had but 44. fathom, which perceiving, he found that he was imbayed, therefore to prevent further danger, he strook sayle and lay to Halle.</P>
<P>29. From midnight untill 3. this morning, he lay on Hull, having the water so shoald, and at 3. the weather clearing a little with the increase of the daylight, hee saw land from the E. by S. to the N. N. E. Easterly, which perceiving, hee set his Sayles, and flats about his Ship head, and stood W. of till noone, 4. Leagues.</P>
<P>Thus at noone it falling calme and hazie, he anckors with his ledge Anckor, hee feared all the coast along to bee rockie ground, and being thus at anckor at 23. Fadome, he had at 2. a Clock a little cleare, and saw the Land not pastt 2. Leagues from him, from the N. to the W. S. W. which together with the Land which he saw in the morning, from S. to the E. by S. N. E. Easterly, gave him assurance, that he was imbayed, for that he could not be of that Easterne Land, above 7. Leagues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">64. deg. 30. m.</NOTE></P>
<P>Being thus at a <HI>Non plus</HI> himselfe by observation, the day before, &amp; by his reckoning since, to be as far Northerly fully, as 65. d. It troubled him something, and especially to see the Easterne Land to treul away Southerly: well the wind com∣ming about to N. N. E. hee came out of this hee called a Bay,
<PB N="126" REF="61"/>
and saith hee was enforced therein by extremity of a S. W. wind, and yet hee saith that by his not far standing from the West side, this Bay cannot be above 16. or 17. Leagues over, from Land to Land, and in his running hee found the depth of it to be not above 4. and 5. and 30. Leagues.</P>
<P>But as a wise Gentleman, and one well understood in the Rules of Navigation, who having exactly surveyd these jour∣nall<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ʋt ukra</HI> not proved a Bay.</NOTE> writs in the Margent. I cannot find that it proved a Bay, nor is it one by any thing herein written, and for other things knowne, is none.</P>
<P>About 5. in the afternoone, the wind encreased to a great storme, he tooke in his Sayles, and went away with a free and<NOTE PLACE="marg">No course so named.</NOTE> sprit sayle, having 46. Fadome, and betweene 7. and 8. hee came after to 62. Fadome, and in a cleere hee saw the Land E. and by S. 3. Leagues off: From the time that he set sayle, this afternoone untill 8. at night, he ranne 7. Leagues S. S. W. the wind at N. N. E. At Clock 10. hee stood S. E. hoping to have found the Land to wind away, and running but ⅓. of an houre, he came to smooth water upon a suddaine, and had but 26. Fadome. And the weather being yet hazie, hee saw the Land faire by him, bearing E. <HI>S.</HI> E. very high Land, then he edg'd of untill midnight <HI>S. S.</HI> E. Easterly, having come since 8. a Clock, 5.

<P>From <HI>Midnight</HI> Land still in <HI>Verioe</HI> he edg'd off W. N. W. and at 2. in the morning hee came into 65. Fadome, then hee edg'd of W. and <HI>S.</HI> W. and <HI>S. S.</HI> W. untill 4. in the morning, when the storme was so violent that he was driven to steere away before it, with his fore course, at 5. this morning by the extremity of the Sea, he sunk his long Boate.</P>
<P>All this morning he steered untill <HI>S. S. S.</HI> W. 5. Laagues a∣long the shoare, and every stache hee saw the Land not above 3. Leagues from him, from 8. untill Noone hee steered <HI>S.</HI> 5. Leagues, then the storme began to lesson, and he put out more Sayle: And this Easterne Land hee saw to beare <HI>S. S.</HI> E. Ea∣sterly from him, and lyeth as neere as he could Iudge <HI>S.</HI> We∣sterly, and Westerly.</P>
<P>From Noone untill Midnight, hee stood away <HI>S. S.</HI> E. 13. Leagues, and from Midnight untill this noone <HI>S. S.</HI> E. 6 Leagues, and 4. Leagues, <HI>S. S.</HI> W.</P>

<P>10. This morning he lay to <HI>Hull,</HI> the weather extreame and<NOTE PLACE="marg">August.</NOTE> hazie and so thick, that he could not see a pistalshot from him, in this time hee drew 2.

<P>In this Bay he handed all his sayles, thinking to have ridde<NOTE PLACE="marg">A good Bay to anchor in.</NOTE> and watered: but his anchor being downe, and his Boat al∣most out, one of his Masters Mates said he descried land from the top Mast head <HI>S.</HI> and by E. the newes whereof made him wonder for that they all knew this was the land they had seene the last yeere, which they tookt to be an Iland.

<P>At 8. this morning he had 50. fathom, the thick was clee∣red,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He named this <HI>Mancels</HI> Iland.</NOTE> and he see land to beare on him East.</P>
<P>From 2. this morning the time of his setting of sayle, hee made N. E. by N. Northerly, 7. leagues; the morning was foggie, but the day proved faire.</P>
<P>At noone they had a good observation; and all that did<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lat. 61. <HI>d.</HI> 38. <HI>m.</HI></NOTE> observe agreed in one, and to be in 61. d. 38. m.

<P>After 3. this afternoone the winde comming to the E. N.

<P>His opinion is that this were the ruines of some, who by mischance had miscarried there by wrack of their Boate, or being inforced to water there, made their best provision they could to endure it, but the extremity being so strong for them, and the place neither affording meanes for them to repaire their Canooes, (the ruines whereof he found some) for fu∣ell for fire to comfort them in Winter, hee gesses this killed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruines of hou∣ses and Ca∣nooes in <HI>Man∣sells</HI> Ile.</NOTE> them, for had they beene any other then such as were thus en∣forced by such extremity, they would not have left such things behind them as they found, for there nature is where∣soever they come to have few things of worth or value be∣hind them, much lesse doth hee thinke they have left their Images, which hee perveiveth they account their gods: And<NOTE PLACE="marg">Images and Mans teeth.</NOTE> there was Mors teeth, for which and the treyne thereof they make all their Sommers travells and labours.</P>

<P>At 4. the afternoone he set sayle, and with small winde at<NOTE PLACE="marg">La. 62. d. 42. m</NOTE> 5. he stood with the Cape, the weather being cleere and faire,
<PB N="132" REF="64"/>
hee sent to the Cape to turne the Tyde, being thwart of the Cape, the point is low with an underland, and some 2. Cables length from shore ia a low flat little Iland; the land you shall open to the Northward, lieth N. W. Westerly, hee boat or bore, he edged of, and anchored within one mile of the land, having opened the land to the westward of the Cape; he an∣chored 15. fathom, and rid there all night to try the tyde, for that his Boat had brought word that it was ebbe tyde, and that it set to the Northward which did agree with the tyde, he found on the Eastland where hee watered: but from the time he now anchored being between 10. and 11. at night, and 3. the next morning, he set sayle, hee could not finde any cer∣tainty, but what followed.</P>
<P>This morning was calme, but the night before was full of<NOTE PLACE="marg">No mention of Ice.</NOTE> strange Harbours as they call them, which is a streame in the Element, like the flame that commeth forth the mouth of a a hot oven, which upon this Coast how faire soever the wea∣ther bee when you see them, yet it is an infallible signe of a storme to follow within 24. houres after, as it proved by this and divers times before.</P>
<P>At 3. this morning without certenty of the Tyde, a small gale S. he wayed and advised with Captaine <HI>Gibbins,</HI> and Cap∣taine <HI>Ingram,</HI> and with the rest, what course was best to bee taken? they resolved this Land falling away N. W. and by W. westerly, and having 113. Fadome within a Mile of the shore, to stand away N. N. W. alougst the shore, resolving not to leave this Land untill he were fully satisfied, standing thus untill 8. at night, being some 7. Leagues of the Cape, he saw an Iland of the westermost Land, that bore from him W. N. W. 7. or 8 Leagues off, hee had then 100. Fathome, and stood N. N. W. as before.</P>
<P>At noone the weather was close and began to blow, hee<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Thomas Button</HI> doth allovv 2. points variation.</NOTE> was then 15. Leagues N. N. W. from the Cape; he doth not write whether true course or no, but in all the former <HI>Hopes Advance</HI> unto this Cape: I have writ by him according to the true course, and had 95. Fadome, which made him as∣sure himselfe, that the Land winded a way more northerly, and thereupon at noone hee stood away N. E. and by N. ho∣ping that course would have bettered his depth, but on the contrary, for in 2. glasses he shoalded to 60. Fathoms, then he
<PB N="133" REF="64"/>
hayled away E. S. E. assuring what experience had often shown him, that as the water shoalded, so the Land winded.</P>
<P>At 3. in the afternoone the weather thick, the wind in∣creasing, and hee in 60. Fathome, knowing there was no bet∣ter depth to the N. ward: hee stood E. S. E. till 8. at night, having 50. Fathome, the weather bad and night at hand, hee stood about, and kept it up with short sayle, all that night be∣tweene S. W. and by W. and W. S. W.</P>
<P>From midnight till 7. this morning; as from 8. last night, till midnight, thus standing, brought him into 80. fathom, he cast about to the Eastward with much winde, at S. S. W. hazy and thick weather; he heeled it up in courses and Bonnets till clock 2. they being starke calmed as it is a speciall note, every Blower ends with a starke calme in those parts, being then in 65. fathom E. he anchored and rid untill 4. in the eve∣ning, when a smal gale rising at S. S. W. he waighed, and stood S. E. guiding himselfe by his depth, for the winde would not give him leave to better his hopes.</P>
<P>17. From midnight to 8. this morning, as the night before, &amp; after that time, there is small worth the Luke to write upon thaverse; and his greatest depth 140. fathom, untill the next day in the afternoone, and then he had sight of the same Cape he sent his Boat unto the 14. day before. It bore from him N. N. W. by compasse about 7. leagues, so he steered S. S. W. un∣till midnight, having runne since he set sayle at 2. in the after∣noone 10. leagues S. E. and by E.</P>
<P>Concluding he writeth that he came to 43. fathom, which<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mansells</HI> Ile &amp; <HI>Ca.

Easterly, and N. N. W. ½. Northerly, about 10. leagues betweene both.</P>
<P>This morning day light, he see the land bearing from S. W. by S. at which time he had 65. fathom.</P>
<P>19. From 2. this morning untill noone, he made away E. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8 by N. 10. leagues. At 7. he saw land on head at least 12. leagues of him; he judged it to bee the high land of the Maine within Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs</HI> his Iland, and yet to beare of him as it did, it was strange unto him: but he saith that Captaine <HI>Gibbons</HI> confidence was such, as that hee must not let passe unspoken of; for albeit that hee is so neere in blood, as that modestie
<PB N="134" REF="65"/>
will not allow of his speaking too much of his merit, yet hee<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capt. <HI>Gibbons.</HI></NOTE> will boldly say thus much of his sufficiency, as hee assures himselfe he shall make it appeare at his returne, if God please to let him live so long, as that he is not short of any man that ever yet he carried to Sea. All that he can say of him further is, that for his Countries good, and for the advancement of this businesse we have in hand; he could wish his body were answerable to his other abilities; which were it; not himselfe, but many, and bis Country most would bee the better for it. But that God that made us all of dust, will not faile to raise up some good spirits he hopes for the further prosecution of this businesse: as that by their honest endeavours, and religi∣ous Resolutions, they will effect that which as yet is not ripe for his Sickle: but that God which best knowes what the truth of his endeavours have beene in this businesse, he hopes will not faile to give a blessing to some that shall follow; and for his part he desires to be blest no otherwise, than as he hath sincerely laboured in it; and therefore he must conclude and ever beleeve according to the word, that <HI>Paul</HI> plants, <HI>Apollo</HI> waters, and God gives the increase. So that untill his good will and pleasure is, all that we doe cannot in this ought else prevaile.</P>
<P>At noone the weather faire and cleare he had a good obser∣vation, by which Captaine <HI>Gibbons</HI> was well assured; but him∣selfe and some others discenting from him in the bearing of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Set of Tyde.</NOTE> the land from them, were deceived in the set of the tyde, which in his going out last yeere, mightily carried him to the Northward, as now as much to the Southward; which then, nor till now, was not found by any of them all.</P>
<P>He steered open of the Land N. N. E. with tyde 5. leagues, untill evening 4. and at 2. he had 307. fathom.</P>
<P>At 6. in the evening small winde, <HI>C. Wolstenholme</HI> bore S. E. 7. leagues of the Westerne point of the westerne Iland, S. E. by S. ½. S. 5. leagnes off, he kept it up that he might get about the Westermost point of <HI>Nottinghams</HI> Iland; (it lying 8. leagues from <HI>Diggs</HI> his Iland, there thinking to trie the tyde; and from thence he purposed to goe to the N. maine betweene <HI>Salisbury</HI> and <HI>Nottinghams</HI> Ile, to try the distance betweene them, it being all he could doe for this yeere.</P>
<P>About 8. this morning the weather thick, and he not above

4. leagues from Ile <HI>Nottingham</HI> in 64. fathom he anchored, and as he remembreth to his comfort being ebbe, hee found it a very strong one from S. S. E. to S. E. and by S.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But was decei∣ved.</NOTE></P>
<P>At noone slack, it was a fresh gale at S. W. hee waighed to get about to the Westward of the Iland, about 2; it blew hard, and was thick weather with raine and thunder, and within a mile of the shore. It fell starke calme upon a sudden, then he was iu a great ripling in 20. fathom water, the Sea all brea∣ches round about him like a Raffe, which deserying, he stood off with little winde along the Iland, and found his drift more<NOTE PLACE="marg">Half an how∣er.</NOTE> in lesse then in one Glasse. Then hee could run a head before with both top-sayles on trip, and a stiffe gale in 2. houres, hee came to anchor to be fully satisfied of the tyde.</P>
<P>But when the tyde came, it came with such force &amp; strength<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strong tyde. Not so.</NOTE> out of the N. W. and by N. as hee had much adoe to ride at, and could not have ridde it had not he steered the ship all the tyde time: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight (hee writes did comfort him) for what was to be done hereafter for by the course of this tyde, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s owne knowledge of the land, being to the Westward of that place 200. leagues, is 86. on the Sea, and might very well say one degree more on land to the Northward, hee then saw<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not so.</NOTE> good reason for it.</P>
<P>At 8. this night the weather being a little cleere, with ebbe he wayed and plied to windward to get about the N. W. end of the Iland; and being about the West point, the ebbe being d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, he saw another point open upon him that bore N. the winde at N. W. in 33. fathoms, the weather thick and bad, he anchored, where in lesse than one houre the tyde of flood came most strong as before, from N. W. and by N. whereby he concluded, having brought the Northerne point N. from him, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it was the true Channell tyde; for had it beene other∣wise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true Channell tyde.</NOTE> it would have come as the land lay, which was N. but now being open of the land, and finding it to come from the N. W. and by N. he faith in his judgement that course, and N. N. W. must direct whomsoever shall seeke this passage here∣after. And the rather to continue himselfe in this opinion, he now to late found, that those that were this way first, &amp; him∣selfe the last yeere were all of them deceived of the set of the tyde, within Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs</HI> his Iland, for there they found it come more Westerly, which was caused by many broken

Ilands that lye to the Westward of it, which he never sawe, untill his returne homewards. And upon this tyde (if I can judge saith he, we cannot be deceived for this caveat, he doth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strong Tyde, or 200. fathom</NOTE> give to whomsoever shall succeed him in this discovery. That whensoever he loseth his strong tyde, or finds ground in 200. fathoms, let himselfe he is out of his direct course for finding of this Voyage. So this his experience upon his unhappy counter-course taught him, that whensoever it is to be found, it must bee in deepe water); and in a strong tyde; and in this course that he took, he hopes it will not be imputed an errour of his; for what he did in the directing of it; for it was to follow the letter of his instructions; For albeit he was pre∣cisely tyed to stand with <HI>Hudsons</HI> Westerland in 58. d. yet he never came much to Leeward of 61. d. till he was encountered with land 200. leagues Westward from Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">No mole stati∣on of Ice in all his returne.</NOTE> his Iland.</P>

<P>Being faire and calme, the Sea almost as steady as on shore, with his Instruments for Variation, hee went to worke to take the time of the Moones comming to the Meridian, and had a Quadrant of 6. foote <HI>Semidiamiter</HI> ready to take <HI>Sols Almicanter,</HI> having taken the Variation of his Needle as pro∣perly as he could, which was 28. <HI>d.</HI> 10. <HI>m.</HI></P>

<PB N="142" REF="69"/>
having this knowne, it is no hard matter to know the Longi∣tude of this place sought; for according to the Moones meane motion, which is 12. <HI>d.</HI> a day, it is in time 48 <HI>m.</HI> and to this account, if shee bee on the Meridian at 12. of clocke this day. tomorrow it will be 48. <HI>m.</HI> past 12. so hee having the time found by observation at this place, <HI>viz.</HI> 5. houres, 4. <HI>m.</HI> 52. <HI>s.</HI> ⅓ 4 / 4. but in this he needeth not come 50. precise, and at <HI>London</HI> at 4. houres, 54. <HI>m.</HI> 30. <HI>s,</HI> which substracted from the former, leaveth 10. <HI>m.</HI> 22 <HI>s.</HI> ⅓ 4 / 4.

<P>The 6. of Aprill another outward bound at Sea, by the Moones comming in a right line, with two fixed Starres; the one was the Lions heart, a Starre of the first magnitude, the other in the Lions Rumps, of second magnitude, as fol∣loweth.</P>
<P>The Circumference or outward eye of the Moones being in a right or straight line, with those two Starres before na∣med, at the instance he tooke the Altitude of the South bal∣lance, 2. <HI>d.</HI> 38. <HI>m.</HI> because he would save the time, but in this it is good to waite a fit time, as to gave her in a right line, with 2.

<P>7. This day he saw the Land it being but low, and the Sea shoald in respect of other places, having 10. or 12. Fathome about a League from shore, and some 30. or 35 Fathomes 5. or 6.

<P>11.

<HEAD>Master <HI>Baffyne</HI> his Letter to the right Worshipfull Sir <HI>Iohn Wolitenholme</HI> one of the chiefe Adventurers for the dis∣covery of a passage to the North west.</HEAD>
<P>VVOrthy Sir, there needs no filling a Iournall or short Discourse with Preamble circumstance or comple∣ment; and therefore I will onely tell I am proud of my re∣membrance, when I expresse your worth to my capacity; and gal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of any good fortune, when I can avoyde the im∣putation of ingratitude, by acknowledgeing your many favours; and seeing it is not unknowne to your Worship in what estate the businesse concerning the North West hath beene heretofore; and how the onely hope was in searching <HI>Fretum Davis;</HI> which if your selfe had not beene the more forward, the Action had wel-nigh beene left of. Now it remaineth for your Worship to know what hath beene performed this yeare; wherefore I intreat you to ad∣mit of my custome, and pardon me if I take the plaine high∣way in relating the particulars without using any refined Phrases, or eloquent speeches.</P>
<P>Therefore briefly thus, and as it were in the Fore-front I entred to shew the whole proceeding of the Voyage in a word, as namely, there is no Passage nor hope of Passage in the North of <HI>Davis</HI> Straight. Wee having coa∣sted all, or neere all the Circumference thereof, and finde it to be no other then a great Bay, as the Voyage doth truely show: therefore I cannot but much admire the worke of the Almighty, when I consider how vaine the best and chiefest hopes of men are in things uncertaine; and to speake of no other matter than the hopefull passage to the North West. How many of the best sort of men have set their whole endeavours to proove a passage that way? not onely in their Conference, but also in writing and pub∣lishing the Worke: Yea what great summes of money ha∣ving beene spent about the Action, as your Worship hath costly experience of? N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither would the Vaine-glorious Spaniard have scattered abroad so many false Mappes and
<PB N="150" REF="73"/>
Iournals, if they had not beene confident of a passage this way; that if it had pleased GOD a passage had beene found, they might have eclipsed the worthy prayse of the Adventurers, and true Discoverers. And for mine owne part I would hardly have beleeved the contrary, untill my eyes became witnesses of that I desired not to have found, still taking occasion of hope on very likeli∣hood till such time as wee had coasted almost all the Cir∣cumference of this great Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Neither was Master <HI>Da∣vis</HI> to bee blamed in his report and great hopes, if hee had anchored abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Hope <HI>Saunderson,</HI> to have taken no∣tice of the Tydes; For to that place which is 72. deg. ½▪ the Sea is all open, and of an unsearchable depth, and of a good colour, onely the Tydes keepe a certaine course, nor rise but a small height, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight or nine foote; and the Flood commeth from the Southward; and in all the Bay beyond that place the Tyde is so small, and not much to bee regarded: yet by reason of Snow melting on the Land, the Ebbe is stronger than the Flood, by meanes whereof, and the windes holding Northerly, the fore part of the yeere the great Ile of Ice are set to the Southward, some into <HI>Fretum Hudson,</HI> and other into <HI>New-found∣land:</HI> For in all where the Channell is open, are great quantities of them driving up and downe; and till this yeere not well knowne where they were become.</P>
<P>Now that the worst is knowne concerning this Pas∣sage; it is necessary and requisite your Worship should understand what probability and hope of profit might here bee made hereafter, if the Voyage might bee at∣tempted by fitting men. And first, for the killing of Whales, certaine it is, that in this Bay are great numbers of them, which the Biscaver calls the Guard Bay▪ Whales of the same kinde which are killed at <HI>Greeneland,</HI> and as it seemeth to mee easie to bee strooke, because they are not used to bee chased or beaten. For wee being but one day in Whale-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound, so called, for the number of Whales wee saw there sleeping and lying alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on the water, nor fearing our Shippe, or ought else▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or if wee had beene fitted with men and things necessarie, it had beene no hard matter to have strooke more then
<PB N="151" REF="73"/>
would have made three Ships a saving Voyage; and that it is of that sort of Whales, there is no feare, I being twice at <HI>Greeneland,</HI> tooke sufficient notice to know them a∣gaine, besides a dead Whale wee found at Sea, having all her Finnes: or rather all the Roughs of her mouth; of which with small labour wee got a hundred and sixty the same evening wee found her: and if fowle weather the next day had not followed, no doubt wee had got all, or the most part of them: But the winde and Sea rising, shee broke from us, and wee were forced to leave her. Neither are they onely to bee looked for in Whale Sound, but also in <HI>Smiths</HI> Sound, <HI>Wolstenholmes</HI> Sound, and o∣thers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>For the killing of Sea-mors I can give no certainty, but onely this: that our Boate being but once a shoare in all the North part of this Bay, which was in the en∣trance of Alderman IONES his Sound; at their re∣turne our Men told us they sawe many Mors along by the shoare on the Ice: but our Ship being under sayle, and the winde comming faire, they presently came on board without further search; besides the people inhabiting about 74. degrees▪ tould us by divers signes, that towards the North there were many of those Beasts having two long teeth; and shewed us divers pieces of the same.</P>
<P>As for the Vnicorne, it being a great Fish, having a long horne borne growing forth of his forehead or no∣strils (such as Sir MARTIN FROBISHER in his second Voyage found one) in divers places wee see of them: which if the horne be of any good value, no doubt but many of them maybe killed.</P>
<P>As concerning what the shoare will yeeld, as Beares skins, Mors teeth, and such like; I can say little, because we came not on Land in any of those places where hope was of finding them.</P>
<P>But here some may object why wee sought that Coast no better? To this I answere, that whilest we were there∣abouts, the weather was so exceeding fowle wee could not; for first wee anchored in <HI>Wolstenholmes</HI> Sound, where presently wedrove with two anchors on head, then we were forced to stand forth with a low sayle; the next day in
<PB N="152" REF="74"/>
Whale Sound we lost Anchor and Cable, and could fetch the place no more; then wee came to Anchor neere a small Iland, being betweene Sir <HI>Thomas Smiths</HI> Sound, and Whales Sound: but the winde came more outward, that wee were forced to weigh againe. Neverthelesse, if we had beene in a good Harbor, having but our Ships Boat we durst not send her farre from the Ship, having so few men as 17. in all, and some of them very weake: but the chiefe cause why wee spent too little time to seeke a Harbor, was our great desire to performe the discovery; having the Sea open in all that part, and still likelihood of a passage: but when we had coast∣ed the land so farre to the S. ward, that hope of a passage was none, then the yeere was too far spent, and many of our men very weake, and withall we having some beliefe that Ships the next yeare would be set forth about the killing of whales which might doe better then we.</P>
<P>And seeing I have briefly set downe what hopes there is of making a profitable Voyage, it is not unfit your Worship should know what let or hindrance may be to the same; the chiefest cause is, that some yeares it may happen by reason of Ice lying between 72. ½▪ and 76. so that the Ships cannot come into those parts untill the middle of Iuly, so that want of time to stay in the Country may bee some let, yet they may well tarry untill the last of August: in which space much businesse may be done, and great store of oyle made. Neverthelesse, if store of Whales come in, as no feare to the contrary; what cannot be made in Oyle, may bee brought home in Blubber, and the Finnes may arise to good profit. Another hinderance will be, because the bottome of the Sound will not be so soone cleare as would bee wished; by meanes whereof, now and then a Whale may be lost. The same cause sometime hapneth in <HI>Greeneland.</HI> Yet I am perswaded the Sounds before, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never will be cleare before the 20. of Iuly. Wee this yeere were in Whales Iland the 4. day amongst many Whales, and might have strooke them without let of Ice.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there is little wood to bee expected either for fire, or other necessaries; therefore Coales and other such things must be provided at home, they will bee much more the ready there.</P>
<P>Thus much I thought good to certifie to your Worship,
<PB N="153" REF="74"/>
whom I hope will conceive, that much time hath not beene spent in vaine or the like businesse, nor carelesly neg∣lected, and although wee have not performed what wee desired (that is to have the passage) yet what wee have promised, as to bring certainty, and a true description truth will make manifest, that I have not much erred.</P>
<P>And I doe boldly say (without boasting) that more good discovery hath not in shorter time (to my remem∣rance) beene done since the Account was attempted, conside∣ring how much Ice we have passed, and the difficulty of Say∣ling so neere the Pole upon a travis.</P>
<P>And above all the variation of the compasse whose won∣derfull opperation is such in this Bay, encreasing and decrea∣sing so suddainely, and swift being in some part, as in <HI>Wolsten∣holmes</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia. 26. d.</NOTE> and <HI>Smiths</HI> Sound varied above 5. points or 56. d. a thing almost incredible, and almost matchiesse in all the world besides, so that without great care and good observations true description would not have beene had.</P>
<P>In fine, whatsoever my labours are or shall be, I esteeme too little to expresse my thankfull mind, for your many favours wherein I shall be ever studious to supply my other wants, by my best endeavours, and ever rest at your worships com∣mand.</P>

<P>Hee prosecuted his voyage being loth to Anchor as yet although the wind was contrary, but plyed to the N. ward, untill he came into 70. d. 20. m. there he entred a faire sound neere Cape <HI>Davies</HI> his <HI>London</HI> coast, the people espying him<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Groanlands</HI> wonder.</NOTE> with great wonder, and gazing fled away in their Boates, and after this night hee saw them no more, yet they left there Dogs running to and fro upon the Iland.</P>
<P>At this place hee stayed two dayes taking in water, and doing things needfull, the Tydes not rising above eight or nine foote made him dislike of the passage, it floweth ¼. past 9, upon the change day the Tyde commeth from the South.</P>

<P>This day hee set saile from thence with faire weather, the wind contrary yet hee plyed it up betweene the Ice and shoare, as it hath beene in a channell of 7. or 8.

<P>Seeing that as yet hee could not proceed, hee determined to stand in for the shore, there to abide untill the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee were<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harbour 73. 45. m.</NOTE> more consumed, which he plainely sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to wast very fast, hee came to anchor 73. 45. m. here hee continued 3. dayes with∣out any shew or signe of people.</P>

<P>Here hee staid 6. dayes, and on this day at night sets sayle with little wind, hee stood to the N. ward, the winde having been contrary, the most part of the moneth, bu. it was strange to see the Ice so much consumed in so little space,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ice consumed.</NOTE> for now hee could come to the 3.

and blew very hard with thicke and foggy weather; he set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayle and runne along the shoare: the second day and the next day<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs</HI> Cape.

<P>This morning a storme began at West, that blew away his fore-course, continuing so, that he was not able to beare any sayle, but lay to <HI>Hull;</HI> and when it cleared up, he found him∣selfe imbayed in a great Sound: then he set sayle and stood o∣ver to the S.

<P>In this sound was great number of Whales; hee called it <HI>Whale-sound</HI> in latitude 77. 30. this day was faire weather, and he kept along by the land: untill he came unto a great banke of yce which was backt with land; which hee seeing, determi∣ned to stand backe againe some 8. leagues to an Island he called <HI>Hauclites Ile.</HI> It lyeth betweene two great sounds, the one<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Whales</HI> Sound, 78.</NOTE> <HI>Whale-sound,</HI> and the other Sir <HI>Tho.

<P>WHen I was at <HI>Venice</HI> in <HI>Aprill</HI> 1596. happily arriued there an old man, aged about 60. called commonly <HI>Iuan de F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>a,</HI> but named properly <HI>Apostollos Valerian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> of Na∣tion a <HI>Greeke,</HI> borne in the <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Sepholonien,</HI> of Profession a Marriner, and an ancient Pylot of shippes: This man came lately out of <HI>Spaine;</HI> ariued first at <HI>Legorne,</HI> and went thence to <HI>Florence,</HI> where hee found out <HI>Iohn Dowlas,</HI> an <HI>English</HI>-man, a famous Marriner, ready comming for <HI>Venice,</HI> to be Pylot of a <HI>Venetian</HI> ship for <HI>England,</HI> they came both to <HI>Venice</HI> together; and <HI>Iohn Dowlas,</HI> being well acquainted with mee, gaue me no∣tice of this Greeke Pylot, and brought him to my speech; and in conference this Pylot declared in the <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> tongue, these words following.</P>
<P>First, hee said that hee had beene in the West <HI>India</HI> of <HI>Spaine,</HI> by the space of Forty yeeres, and sayled too and fro, as Marriner and Pylot to many places thereof in the seruice of the <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
<P>Also he said that hee was in the <HI>Spannish</HI> shipp, which in re∣turning from the Islands of <HI>Philipinas</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> was robb'd neere Cape <HI>Callif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnia</HI> by Captaine <HI>Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndish,</HI> an <HI>English</HI>-man; whereby hee lost 60. Thousand Duckets of his owne goods.</P>
<P>Also hee said that hee was Pylot of 3. small Shipps, which
<PB N="294" REF="80" MS="y"/>
the Victory of <HI>Mexicoe</HI> sent from thence, armed with a 100. Souldiers, vnder a Captaine <HI>Spaniard</HI> to discouer the streights of <HI>Anian,</HI> along the Coast of the South Sea; and to fortefie in that streight to resist the Passage of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, which were afraid to passe through the streights into the South Sea; and that by reason of a Mutinie which happened amongst the Souldiers, for the Sodomie of their Captaine; that Voyage was ouerthrowne, and the Ship turned backe from <HI>Califirnia,</HI> to <HI>Noud Spania,</HI> without any effect of things done in that Voy∣age, and at their returne the Captaine was punished at <HI>Mexicoe.</HI></P>
<P>Also hee saith, that after the said Voyage was so ill ended, the Vice-roy set him out againe in 1592. with a small Caravell and a Pinnace, armed with Marriners onely for discovery of the said Streight; and hee following his course W. and N. W. in the South-sea, along the coast of <HI>Nova Hispaniae,</HI> and <HI>Cali∣firnia</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> now called North <HI>America;</HI> all which voyage hee signified vnto me in a great Mappe and Carde of my owne which I laide before him, vntill hee came to the Latitude of 47. degrees. and that there finding the land to trent N. and N.

<P>Also he said, that hee went on land indivers places; and that hee saw some people on land clad in Beast-skinns: and that the land was very fruitfull, and rich of gold and silver and Pearles and other things like <HI>Nova Hispaniae,</HI></P>
<P>Also hee said, that hee being entred thus farre into the said<NOTE PLACE="marg">10</NOTE> Streight, and being come into the North-Sea allready, and finding the Sea wide enough every where, and to bee about 30. or 40. leagues wyde in the Streight where hee entred: hee thought he had now well discharged his office, &amp; done the thing which he was sent to doe: and that he not being armed, to resist the force of the <HI>Saluage</HI> people that might happen to assault him, therefore hee set sayle, and returned towards <HI>Noua Hispaniae,</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="80"/>
where he arrives at <HI>Aquapulco, Anno</HI> 1592. hoping to be well rewarded of the Viceroy for his voyage so performed.</P>
<P>Also he said, that he was greatly welcomed to <HI>Mexico</HI> by the Viceroy and had promise of great reward; but staying there 2 yeares to his small content, the Viceroy told him he should be rewarded in <HI>Spaine</HI> of the King, and therefore wil∣led him to repayre thither, which he did performe.</P>
<P>At his comming thither he was greatly welcomed at the Kings Court in words, but after long suite he could not get a∣ny reward there to his content; and therefore at length he stole away and came into <HI>Italy,</HI> to get home to live amongst his kindred in his owne country, he being now very old.</P>
<P>Also he said, that he thought that the cause of his ill reward was had of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be, for that they did understand ve∣ry well that the <HI>English</HI> Nation had now given over all their voyages for the discovery of the N, W. passage, wherfore they feared not them any more to come that way into the S. Sea; and therefore they needed not his service therein any more.</P>
<P>Also he said, that in regard of his ill reward had of the <HI>Spa∣niard;</HI> and understanding of the Noble mind of the Queene of <HI>England,</HI> and of her warres maintained so valiantly against the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> hoping her Ma<SUP>tie</SUP>, would do him Iustice for his goods lost by Capt. <HI>Cavendish,</HI> he would be content to goe into <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and serve her Ma<SUP>tie</SUP>. in that Voyage to discover the N, W. passage into the S Sea, and would put his life in her Maiesties hands to performe the same, if shee would furnish him with one ship of 40 tonnes, and one Pinnace, and that hee would performe the same from the one end of the Straits to the o∣ther, and he willed me so to write into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon after this twice conference I did write to the old Lord Treasurer <HI>Cicil,</HI> and to Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh,</HI> and to Mr. <HI>Richard Hackluit</HI> that famous Cosmographer, praying that 100 pounds might be sent for the charge of sending this Pylot in∣to <HI>England,</HI> I received answer from some of my friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that the action was well liked of; if the money could be procu∣red; After one fortnight he went from mee into his owne countrey, where he dyed.</P>

<HEAD>MY PREPARATIONS to the Voyage.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>Entlemen, our <HI>Yorkeshire</HI> Proverbe is, <HI>Plaine dealing is a Iewell;</HI> So it is, that I was neither importuned nor intreated to this vndertaking by any eyther Noble or Gentle, but the Truth is, that I had beene itching after it e∣ver since 1606. when I should have gone Mate to <HI>Iohn Knight,</HI> of whom doth follow, yet I must confesse that heere my ambition soa∣red a pitch higher then my abilitie, as now time hath made me to know, yet his Discretion and Experience taught him to discerne of what could bee in my youth, but I presuming vpon some parts I had, as the vse of the Globes and other Mathe∣maticke Instruments, (having beene Sea bred from my Boyes∣time, and had beene in the <HI>Mediterranian, Spaine, France, Holland, Norway, Denmarke,</HI> and the <HI>Balticke</HI> Sea,) thought my selfe to bee fit for the best imployment, desired to be pluckt before I was ripe; but hee durst not depend vpon me in that place for the Voyage, so as I did not proceed with him; yet I was still kept in Marine imployments along the Coast and Crossing the Sea, whereby I gained Experience, and also at the Returnes home of all Ships from thence, I enqui∣red of the Masters Mates and others that were that way im∣ployed,
<PB N="170" REF="85"/>
whereby I gathered by Report and Discourse and Ma∣nuscripts, how farre they had proceeded, what they had done, and what was to doe: To better which, I often repaired to Mr. <HI>IOHN TAPPE,</HI> whose acquaintance was much amongst these men, he also acquainting me with Mr. <HI>THO. STERNE</HI> Globe-maker, (whom I have found to have engrossed all those former Voyages by Relation, Manuscripts; and Maps;) from whom I gathered much, and must needs say, hee is a very well deserving Practitioner: So that I thought my selfe to be now ready for the same attempt, when occasion should present it selfe.</P>
<P>Which fell out by former acquaintance I had with that fa∣mous Mathematician Mr. <HI>HENRY BRIGGES,</HI> who moo∣ved me thereto and I willingly consented, so as things could be brought to passe, the which to strengthen himselfe, hee acquainted that Hon: Knight Sir <HI>IOHN BROOKE,</HI> whom both to▪ doe their King service, &amp; the Publike good, perswades with divers of their friends to come into the Adventure.</P>
<P>Whereupon, wee exhibited a Petition to his Maiesty for the lend of a Ship for the Voyage and countenance to the Action, who Graciously accepted and granted both; but the time of the yeare was so farre spent before wee could make our provision ready, as wee were forced to desist vntill the yeare following: in which processe Mr. <HI>BRIGGES</HI> deceased, and the one halfe of the Adventure fell away.</P>
<P>In the meane time and before the next yeare, one Captaine <HI>IAMES</HI> of <HI>Bristow,</HI> had so wrought with the Marchants of the sayd Citie for to set forth one Ship for the same designe, as they were willing to adventure so as they might share with <HI>London,</HI> in equall honour and profit, whether Ship soever found the same, and this as was signified in a Letter from Captaine <HI>IAMES</HI> to Mr. <HI>BRIGGES,</HI> which Letter I did see is he showed the same to Sir <HI>IOHN BROOKE,</HI> they both con∣senting to write backe againe vnto him that the Request was
<PB N="171" REF="85"/>
condescended vnto, of which and for better assurance, Capt. <HI>IAMES</HI> ridde from <HI>Bristow</HI> to <HI>Oxford</HI> before the death of Mr. <HI>BRIGGES</HI> desiring, that seeing we were both to goe forth in one yeare that hee might goe in the higher place, but was denyed.</P>
<P>In this interim came home that Honourable Knight Sir <HI>THOMAS ROE</HI> from his Ambassage to the King of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> who being made acquainted with the Designe, gave it his best furtherance, when his Maiesty sending for this voy∣ages never failing friend Sir <HI>IOHN WOLSTENHOLM</HI> the elder Knight, appointing them two to expediate forward the enterprize. Commanding the Master and Wardens of the <HI>Trinity-House</HI> to be assisting hereunto; and young Sir <HI>Iohn Wolstenholme,</HI> that now is, was appointed Treasurer.</P>
<P>The Ship of his Maiesties, was (of my owne chusing, and the best for condition and quality, especially for this voyage that the world could afford) of Burthen 80. Tonnes, the num∣ber of men 20. and 2. boyes, and by all our Cares was shea∣thed, Cordaged, Builded and repaired; all things being made exactly ready against an appointed time.</P>
<P>My greatest care was to have my men of Godly conversa∣tion, and such, as their yeares of time not exceeding 35. had gained good Experience, that I might thereby be the better assisted, especially by such as had been vpon those Frost biting voyages by which they were hardned for indurance, and could not so soone be dismayed at the sight of the Ice. For beard∣lesse younkers, I knew as many as could man the Boate was e∣nough; and for all our dependances was vpon GOD alone, for I had neither private end, ambition, or vaine glory.</P>
<P>And all these things I had contractedly done by the Master, Wardens and Assistants of the <HI>Trinity-House.</HI> For a Lieu∣tenant I had no vse, but it grieved me much that I could not get one man that had bin on the same voyage before, by whose counsaile or discourse I might better have shunned the Ice.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="148"/>I was Victualed compleatly for 18 Moneths, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at whether the Baker, Brewer, Butcher, and other, were Mr. of their Arts or professionsor no I know not, but this I am sure of, I had excellent fat Beefe, strong Beere, good wheaten Bread, good <HI>Iseland</HI> Ling, Butter and Cheese of the best, admirable Sacke and Aqua-vita, Pease, Oat-meale, Wheat-meale, Oyle, Spice, Suger, Fruit and Rice; with Chyrurgerie, as Sirrups, lulips, condits, tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hissis, antidotes, balsoms, gummes, vnguents, implaisters, oyles, potions, suppositors, and purging Pils, and if I had wanted Instruments my Chyrurgion had enough.</P>
<P>My Carpenter was fitted from the thickest bolt to the pumpe-nayle or tacket.</P>
<P>The Gunner from the Sacor to the Pistoll.</P>
<P>The Boatswaine from the Cable to the Sayle-twine.</P>
<P>The Steward and Cooke, from the Caldron to the Spoone.</P>
<P>And for Bookes, if I wanted any. I was too blame being bountifully furnisht from the Treasurer with money to pro∣vide me, especially for those of study there would be no leisure nor was there, for I found worke enough; and if the matter it selfe had not been in another place when sodaine occasion was present, it had bin too late for me (like the <HI>Holland</HI> Skipper to runne to his Chest) to looke vpon his <HI>Waggoner</HI> booke. But those things I feare, you will say they are needlesse (yet give me leave to follow the fashion) and good for nothing, but to make Courtiers and Schollers marvell at my curiositie, and thinke strange that there should be so much adoe about making a Ship take the Sea.</P>
<P>Things in this readinesse, I was brought to his Maiestie, where I received his Gracious favour with a Mappe of all my Predecessors Discoveries, his Maiesties Instructions, with a Letter to the Emperour of <HI>Iapon.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Discourse for the same.</HEAD>
<P>Setting forth and beginning my accompts from the W. most place of <HI>Orkney</HI> I made 2 observations for the variation of the compasse, evenin Amplit. the one was 8 d. the other 4 d. but I<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thicke Ho∣rizon.</NOTE> do give no certain credit therunto, yet I do rather trust to that of 8 d. at which instant, I did account I was 24 deg. or there∣about, Eastward of the great Meridian, and neere the par∣ralell of 60 deg. continuing the course W. ward as wind would serve, untill I came into the Latit. of 58 deg. 12 min. I was then 12 deg. or thereabouts, from the place of my departure, and traversing with contrary windes, betwixt the latit. of 59 deg. 12 min. and 60 deg. 20 min. at 18 d. ½. distance from my setting forth, I continued the course still Westward, with so small difference, betwixt my observation and protraction, or traverse, as I thought I might as well trust to the one, as the other. Continuing this course in the latit. of 60 deg. 19 m. W.<NOTE PLACE="marg">N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta.</NOTE> from the first Meridian 6 deg. I found by my observation that I was to S. ward 5 m of my protracted course, and though then I did perceive, that the Compasse was varied Westward, yet how much for want of Amplitude, or celestiall observation, could not be knowne.</P>
<P>Now the wind comming freely on, and, taking Mr. <HI>Hals</HI> ac∣count. That Cape <HI>Farewell</HI> in <HI>Groyneland,</HI> which land first I did desire to fall with (though I did not much regard) lyeth 18 d. W. from the great or first Meridian, as also Mr. <HI>Brigges</HI> is neare the same, and in latit. about 59 deg. I directed the course W. and W. and by S. thinking thereby to fall in fight of the said Cape. And although there is no certainty of agreement a∣mongst some of my predecessours, concerning the variation there, some writing 11 d. others 14 d. confusedly, yet I did hope that course would have brought mee at least to sight thereof, report making it to be high and Mountainous land, (not withstanding Variation or current) especially having so franke a gale of wind, and but 12 d. of a small circle neere the 60 paralell, the distance being but 120 leag. at most, and in that distance holding the same course, I had 2 deg. 14 min. to wracke upon, and within one point at most of my paralell; and neerer with a sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e gale wet and hazie, I durst not hale for<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Mr. <HI>Hall Davis,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> others.</NOTE> engaging my selfe, with an unknowne Cape, which hath both Ilands, and Ice lying there off, where I might have beene

endangered (at the least incumbred.) Now when I had sailed 100 leag. from the said latit. I met with Ice, and as before, in <MILESTONE N="June." UNIT="Moneths"/> such weather, I would not deale with land, but stood away 30 leag. more to the Westward.</P>
<P>Hauing an observation in 58 d. 10 min. and by my protract <MILESTONE N="14" UNIT="Da"/> or dead reckoning, I was in latit. 59 d. 27 min. contrary to ex∣pectation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Variation &amp; Current might doe this.</NOTE> the same afternoone the variation taken by <HI>Azimuth</HI> and <HI>Almicanter</HI> was 8 d. 50 m. but being set more to S. ward then this allowance, I did call to minde the current which Sir <HI>Martin Frobrisher</HI> found upon the coast of <HI>Greenland,</HI> in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Frobri∣sher.</HI></NOTE> lat. about 62. setting from N, E. to S, W. as the land doth there lye; where they doe affirme that the flood tyde did run 9 houres, and the ebbe but 3. I know no other cause for this but the large distance betwixt <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> on the E. and <HI>Groenland,</HI> in which the Ocean may take opportunity, to use his naturall agitation from E, to W. being thereunto drawne by the restlesse motion and impulsion of the Heavens, and here butting upon <HI>Groenland,</HI> must of necessity (the land lying some∣what neere his naturall inclination) trend along there, setting his current to the S, W. or else, as in a huge Bay, make a Re∣percussive motion (as in the Bay of <HI>Mexico</HI>) by entring in at the S. side, and wheeling about by the bottome, must revert back againe along the North side by Cape <HI>Florida.</HI></P>
<P>Now this 9 houres of the floud-tyde running, may be by this restraint of the Seas naturall course (in meeting with the land) must needs enforce all the Sounds, Bayes, Rivers, and through-lets, with quantities of waters, and in through-lets especially, setting Westward, and wanting Limitation shall continue his naturall course the longer being assisted by that motion, untill the ebbe being strengthened by the height of waters (or of course) from the W. Sea, shall returne againe, according to his proper retraction.</P>
<P>And thus much further I am of opinion, if Sir <HI>Martin Fro∣brisher▪</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Orteli∣us Ʋnivers.

<P>This snowie morning I stoode in againe, at clocke 7.

<P>This day we had boarded it up in smooth water, bearing a <MILESTONE N="22" UNIT="Da"/> good saile betweene Cape <HI>Chidlie</HI> and Cape <HI>Warwicke</HI> and were entred <HI>Fretum Hudson,</HI> and now I desire a little of your patience; The Iland <HI>Resolution</HI> so named, by whom, I know not, but sure I am, <HI>Davis</HI> was the first of us that see it, naming the East end thereof Cape <HI>Warwicke,</HI> and it seem∣eth for good reason, for that honourable house hath, and unto this day doth still cherrish, those worthy Marine en∣terprises, as doth appeare by <HI>Frobrishers</HI> 3, Voyages to<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Frobri∣sher.</HI> Lord <HI>Riv.</HI> Iles. <HI>Cumberl.</HI> Iles.</NOTE> their no small charge, as also those two Honourable houses of <HI>Darcie,</HI> now Lord <HI>Rivers,</HI> by whom <HI>Davis</HI> named certaine I∣lands, upon the North part of <HI>America;</HI> wherein he found Deere, the other is <HI>Cumberlands,</HI> to whom he dedicated other Ilands; in his furthest West, in a passage he entred 60 leagues, but he came backe.</P>

<P>Having made this Cape, which to doe I stood over, as neere as I could for ice, but was at least 6 leagues off, it appeared high, and 4 distinct Ilands (in number) I iudge there is more; being now assured that God had sent me into the passage, I stoode over to the North with Cape <HI>Warwick,</HI> the middle Channell was cleare of ice, and therein I had a good observation of 61 degrees, 10 min. cleare weather, and a constant gale, otherwise I durst not have stoode, to the Southwards, remembring <HI>Gibbons;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Felix quem▪</NOTE> it blew in both topsailes, but towards night the wind lessened, and I could perceive the ice betwixt me, and the Cape, to drive to Seaward, of which neere the shoare, was great store.</P>
<P>The flood comming on, I caused both Topsayles to bee cast over, and wee threed it, betweene Ice and Ice, with a well bent flood inwards, so as that we had got above the Ile (that tyde) if this faire day had not ended in fogge. A motion was made before this, to looke for harbour, but that I denied, for those reasons given, that I did not know, what danger might fall me, if I had put into the shore, where lay much yce (as we could see) and what yce or sunke Rocks might be in the way, I was as ignorant of; besides not knowing whether the wind would serve to bring me in a safe roade, and how the Tyde might set to turne or sayle in, as occasion might fall out, but the worst was and that was most I feared, the wind might Souther, and then there being such store of yce in the passage, would inforce all the harbours full, and so might cut my cable, and put me on shore upon the Rockes, it flowing much water there, as <HI>Bassin</HI> reports, with these

<P>This misty morning, made the Sunne clime 10 degrees in <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="Da"/> height, before he could peepe through the same, which afterwards prooved a very faire calme hot day, making both Ice and Pitch runne, but the ship was inclosed, a∣mongst the Ice driving with ebbe and flood, about 2. leagues from the South end of <HI>Resolution,</HI> I had no ground at 180 fathomes, some of my men said they saw smoake on land, and after it prooved true, for Captaine <HI>James</HI> was in harbour there all that same time, my Master went with boate and kild 9, willicks, whereof he kindly bestowed upon every

<P>I pressing hard for getting cleere, that I might proceed, was <MILESTONE N="June." UNIT="Moneths"/> demanded why I made such haste, answered, that as every Mountaine consisted of severall peeces, so did my Voyage up∣on Fathomes, which must be measured here with speed, though afterward I might take leisure, which added one to another, might in time compasse all the Mountaines of the world, and that it fared with me, as with the Mackarell-men at <HI>London,</HI> who must hasten to Market before the fish stinke.</P>
<P>This evening the Sun set cleare, the Ayre breathed gent∣ly from the East, and we lay quietly all night amongst the Ice.</P>
<P>This morning the wind began to gather strength, from the <MILESTONE N="24" UNIT="Da"/> E, S, E. the flood came on, and the Ice began to separate; I caused one peece to be made fast unto the ship, with 2. Grap∣nels, to the intent to towe it at the ships sterne, mooring the ship so thereunto, that she might make way N, W. for the North shore, for that it hath been alwayes said, that the North side was cleerest from Ice; thus made fast, although the wind forst on the ship, yet her way was so easie, as she could take no harme, if she had touched upon the same, because this trayle or drag stayed her way; but the wind blowing on, the ship broke one Grapnet off by the Arme of the flooke, and bended the other, so as we were loose from thence; but mee∣ting great store of driving Ice, I caused to make fast a∣gaine for safety, where we were presently inclosed for many miles.</P>
<P>This morning, the ship broke loose from that peece, I was <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="Da"/> made fast unto, the ship and tackling being more in the winds power then the Ice, (it being lower) caused her to drive faster.</P>
<P>I caused the Spritsaile to be loosed, to binde the ships Stem to the Ice, which gave alwayes way with the flood, which set Westward; So the East wind forcing it backe, made it cloze with the ebbe, returning Eastwards, which put mee in good hope, that further within the straight, I should finde all cleare, or at least the Ice so thinne, as I might passe betweene one and another, and with this perswasion I drew on the Company, that the S, E. winds which had blown for 6 or 7 dayes before we came into this Freet, had kept in
<PB N="186" REF="92"/>
this Ice, and those West winds, which had blowne 3 dayes before, and at our entry, comming (from about 140 leagues)<MILESTONE N="Iune" UNIT="Moneths"/> from the bottome heere, in some places 20, in some places 30, and in some 40 leagues more, or lesse broad, had packt all from thence, unto this straitened place, betwixt Cape <HI>Chidley,</HI> and the body of <HI>Resolution,</HI> and so choaked this entrance, being not above 14 leagues broad, the wind E, N, E. we drive all this time inwards with the ice.</P>
<P>Now this prodigious thing we call Ice, is of two sorts, as<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quantity and shapes of Ice.</NOTE> mountainous ice w<SUP>ch</SUP> is a huge peece compact, of a great quan∣tity, some of more, some of lesse; but in this Freet, you seldome have any bigger then agreat Church, and the most therof lesse, being of severall formes, as some 20, some 30, some 40 yards above the superficies of the water, but farre more under, of these you may tell sometimes 7 or eight in sight, so that they are no hindrance to us.</P>
<P>The other is smaller, and that we call masht or fleackt ice: of this you shall there have numbers infinite, some of the quantity of a Rood, some a Pearch, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> / <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an acre, some 2 acres, but the most is small and about a foot or 2, or more above the wa∣ter, and 8 or 10, or more under the water, and those are they which doe inclose you; So as in much wind from the topmast head, you shall hardly see any water for them, but whilst you lie amongst them, it is so smooth as you shall not feele the ship stirre, onely if it be much wind, make the ship snogge, and at returne of the Tydes, when the ice doth loozen, have all care to the Rudder: at shift of wind the ice will make way one from another, in the meane time have patience, and in trailing of ice on sterne, if the ship doe touch but against it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tracing of Ice.</NOTE> with the stemme, so as the stroke sodainely stay her way, then have care to keep the helme in midships, for your traile with its way, will come presently against the backe, of the Rudder, and it lying on either side, is in danger to breake, or set it on wry.</P>
<P>There is another way which is to muzzell the ship, with a peece of ice close to his stem and bowes the ice, being so swif∣ted, the ship is to drive it, with head saile, but this I doe not cōmend, for that the ship not having fresh way, shall not have her steering beside the edy water, the forst ice shall make, not comming quicke to the Rudder, it shall not command her, so
<PB N="187" REF="92"/>
as if any wind be, shee shall cast a thwart with head to the wind, and drive sterne wayes to the great danger of her Rud∣der <MILESTONE N="Iune." UNIT="Moneths"/> if ice be in the way.</P>
<P>This day hath been wet fog, unto evening 6. then it clee∣red,<MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="Da"/> at 10 we see land to the N. not certaine whether <HI>Resoluti∣on,</HI> or no, for there was no remarkeable thing thereon, this E∣vening Sun kist <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is</HI> in our sight, the same greeting was 5 d. W. from the N. and at the same instant, the Rainebowe was in appearance, I thinke to Canopy them a bed.</P>
<P>At the beginning of flood, here is wheeling streames like edie tides, I take to be caused by the ice themselves, one draw∣ing more water then another, and continueth all the time of their moving, untill they be setled, so as it may be conjectured that it doth runne ½ tyde under other, as in most places else∣where all this time, since the wind came E. ward, it hath not blowne above course, and bonnet Gale.</P>
<P>This morning the Sun rose cleare, and so continued all this <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="Da"/> cold Virgin day, for I have not seene one cloud to interpose, yet he went peeping through a cloud to bed, and now the frost takes care that there shall no more pitch runne from off the Sun side of the ship, and the land towards Sun-set, doth so altar by the exhalation of vapours, that it shewes now firme land, then a Bay, now high, then low, that we cannot say whe∣ther we make maine-land, Bayes or through-lets, the ice with the uncertain reflex of the Sun, made such unconstant shapes.</P>
<P>This morning the Sun shewed himselfe, through Fly-land,<MILESTONE N="27" UNIT="Da"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vapour∣land.</NOTE> and the Southwind drave away the vapours, which fully satis∣fied our mistaking of land the last evening, yet we were not mistaken, but that we drive into the passage all this while, this wind with tyde, helpes to separate the ice, (a little) it being advantageous for the N. Main, I caused to make loose, whence we furtherd ½ a mile, the wind comming W. with fog caused us to make fast againe, God thinke upon our imprisonment, with a <HI>supercedias,</HI> this evening Sun dog, I hope may bring some change to our good.</P>
<P>This overcast day proved faire, and a pretty W, N, W. gale, untill towards night, my Carpenter made straight a peece, a∣bove the backe of our Rudder, which was set awry with the ice, I caused the lead to be cast in 320 fathomes, but the under∣ebbe-tide did carry it so far to the E. as wee could not thinke
<PB N="188" REF="93"/>
wee had lesse stray then 30 fat homes, the ground was small blacke sand, with long crooked things the length of a needle,<MILESTONE N="June" UNIT="Moneths"/> and the small body of two shell fishes, like Lobsters, but no bigger then Maggots.</P>
<P>This faire hot day is now almost neere at end, we lye a∣mongst <MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="Da"/> the Ice, and I doe not know what wind to pray for, to quit us of them, they lie so thicke every way; but I thinke we feare more danger then wee are in, God for his mercies sake set us at libertie; I can perceive wee drive to the N, W. ward, and have 210 fat homes of water under vs, the Sunne set cleere this Evening.</P>
<P>This hot day is also at an end, I have had an Ayre of wind,<MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="Da"/> with all sayle on board, and threading betwixt the Ice, got a∣bout 4 miles N, W. wards, and stucke fast againe, by the way, I came by one peece of Ice, something higher then the rest; whereupon a stone was of the Contents of 5 or 6 Tonne weight, with divers other smaller stones, and mudde thereon. It see meth to condescend with reason, that these peeces of ice are ingendred upon the Winters snow, which falling in drifts by the forcing &amp; wheeling of the wind, condensing and com∣pacting a great quantity together, over the steepe brow of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compact∣ing of Ice.</NOTE> some high mountaine, cleaving thereto untill dissolving time of the yeare, when the earth receives her naturall warmnesse then inforced by their weight to tumble into the Sea, carrying with them all such trees or stones as they have formerly in∣closed; God be thanked, the Ice begun to thinne, and sepa∣rate, this hot weather doth fast dissolve them.</P>
<P>This night, clocke 2, came a small Iland of Ice, brought up with the latter flood, and by his draught being deeper in the Tydes way then the flact or masht Ice, had a greater motion continued by the undertyde, then that which had inclosed us, of which we were fast unto one, of the biggest, content to wit, 3 Acres; this Iland did drive right with us, and but that some few masht Ice interposed, thereby diverting the course there∣of, some 2 or 3 ships length it had drove directly upon us, and had crusht us mainely, if not to peeces, it being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or 10 fa∣thomes above water; and if it had boarded us, being under∣mined by the waters continuall working, the outside thereof by that shake might have fallen into the ship, and have sunke her; this was the greatest danger we were in, since I came into

<HI>Fretum Hudson,</HI> the fault being in the watch, who did not call, that we might have set the ship the one way or the other, about the peece we were fast unto, before we were so inga∣ged, as I could doe neither; about one houre after, the said I∣land tooke his recourse backe againe to the East, with the ebbe faster then the other ice could doe.</P>
<P>This morning 8, the Sunne was up, before we saw it,<MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="Da"/><MILESTONE N="July." UNIT="Moneths"/> the day was warme, and close, but calme, so as I could not stirre for want of wind, the straight doth cleere, and this N. land, that hath continued with us, since we departed with <HI>Re∣solution,</HI> it now bearing from E. and by S. to N. &amp; by E. if <HI>Baf∣finn</HI> writ truely, that <HI>Resolution</HI> is an Iland separate from this, then is this another (though formerly taken for the N.

<P>This night 7, it was an Ayre, farre better then a younger brother, the ice well thinn'd, I caused the ship to be loosed, and by that time the Master with the boat was come from killing of Fowle, I stood to the N. about foure miles, this fayre day being at an end, I made fast, set the watch and went to Cab∣bin.</P>
<P>This morning 2, an easie gale breathed from the E. by South which caused mee to send to the boatswaine to call up the Company where a chiefe one amongst us, being too suddenly awaked, speaking something peevishly, I told the rest that the matter was not great, for the children did so when they were awaked out of their sleep; I began now to find the want of a Shallop, which at home I did so earnestly desire, for my Cocke boat would nor Rowe no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sayle to any purpose, so as I<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cock-boat.</NOTE> durst hardly send her from me, for when it was any billow, she was not to be rowed, and with saile to windward shee would doe nothing, although I had caused a large Lee board to be made to helpe her.</P>
<P>This Meridianall observation, the wind came West, and I was in 61 d. 57. m. and stood in close to this inremarkeable shore, &amp; so all the land within this straight, may be called, for it is all shoring, or descending from the highest mountaine to the Sea. Whereon the Snow falling by degrees, doth presse <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Da"/> and burthen it selfe, making the masse more solid; which at the
<PB N="190" REF="94"/>
Spring time, when it loosneth from the earth, its own weight doth force downward into the Sea, being all composed of <MILESTONE N="July."

We are now cleere of chattered Ice, yet (in sight) are some Islands, about which wee can compasse as we please; here lyeth many small Ilands close by the Mayne, and there doth appeare to be fayre sounds into the land, upon the Sea this calme time that hath beene, doth swimme a kind of corrupt slime, one may thinke it may come by generation of great fishes, for it feeles soft and unctious, but put it into the fire it will not burne.</P>
<P>I doe thinke that all this time of our imprisonment, this North shore hath beene free, as I could espie it at <HI>Hiperions</HI> going downe, which valed with a blacke Skreene of moyst Fogge, wet through our Coates before we see it againe, this fayre dayes Westwind blew cold and uncouth from out the passage, wee are all upon kinde tearmes, drinking one to ano∣ther, God hold it.</P>
<P>This morning the Sunne lickt up the Fogges dew, as soone <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="Da"/> as hee began to rise, and made a shining day of it, I cannot say hot, it being counter-checkt by a coole Top-sayle Gale, from West, North-West, which made our Noses runne, the cleare day emboldened me to stand within two leagues of land to the deepe of 32 fathomes, the ground white sand and gray with shels, the water was falling, the houre 11 before noone, the Sunne and Moone in opposition, a good Tyde set along the shoare to the Northwards the Sunne set cleare, it was faire weathen and calme, the ship drove along the shore this night to the Westward.</P>
<P>This morning at clocke one, I called to lanche the Boate, to send to shore, to try the Tyde, and against that time that I could send to land, I had drawne those instructions follow∣ing, and giving them to <HI>Iohn Coatesworth,</HI> whom I ap∣pointed alway to goe in the boate, at whose returne I expect∣ed an account.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>These are the Instructions.</HEAD>
<P>First, You shall take with you into the boate, one halfe
<PB N="191" REF="94"/>
houre glasse one halfe minute glasse, one logge and line, cleane Paper, one Pensill of blacke Leade, and one Compasse, with <MILESTONE N="July." UNIT="Moneths"/> some peeces of Iron.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Take in the boat with you.</NOTE></P>
<P>Secondly, One quarter Saw, two Axes, three Carbins Guns with Powder and Shot, two or three Lances, two Swords, two Pikeaxes and every man his one day bread.</P>
<P>Thirdly, At your departure from the ship, turne the halfe houre, and when it is neere out, set your Logge to goe by the halfe minute, that thereby you may estimate the distance be∣tweene the ship and land, as also what the boate can rowe an houre.</P>
<P>Fourthly, When you shall approch neere the shore in the Tydes way, I meane cleare of Bay-point, or Rocke, Anchor the Boat, sound the deepe, and marke the Tyde how it doth set, and by your Logge what it doth passe in the halfe minute, having rode there for halfe a Glasse, weigh your Anchor, and goe to land, and duely observe, what quantity of water it doth flow, or fall perpendiculer, in one Glasse, whether the heigh∣tening, or lessening be equall in every Glasse, while yee stay or noe.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Being thus on land with your Compasse, set all Lands or Islands in sight, draw the forme with your Paper and Pensill, and estimate their distance.</P>
<P>Sixtly, Remember I give you no libertie to goe within the land, yet if for recreation goe no further then the full Sea marke, and armed, leaving two to keepe the Glasse and Boat, looke for stones of Orient colour, or of weight, Seamors teeth, Vnicornes horne, or Whale Finne, Plants, Herbes, or any thing, Spungy fleet out of the Sea, if you finde Scurvie grasse, Orpin, or Sorrill, bring them all on board to me.</P>
<P>Seventhly, If you will goe above the full Sea marke, looke for scoting of wilde Beasts; by that, or their dung, you may imagine what they are, if Deere doe not chase them into the land, for feare of being betrayed, for the people in those parts, are all treacherous, how faire soever they intreat you, remem∣ber also that the losse of you or the boate, is the utter over∣throw of the whole Voyage.</P>
<P>Eightly, If you finde of their Tents, and they fled, doe no harme to any of their buildings, but bring with you the most

things of marke, leaving in the same place, a peece of Iron,<MILESTONE N="Iuly." UNIT="Moneths"/> bigger or lesser, as you estimate the same to be of worth unto us; and so neare as you can chuse, a beach or sandy Bay to land in, for there you shall espie most likelihood of Inhabi∣tants.</P>
<P>Ninthly, leave one Carbine, one Lance, and one short Sword, to defend the boat, with whose (tow) keepers, you shall give charge, that if either they shall espie any token from the ship, as striking the maine Topsaile, Mison, and Spritsaile, Gunshot, or Firesmoke, or be assaulted by any the Inhabitants, that then they shall discharge the said Carbine. To the first in∣tent, that you repaire with speed on board; to the second for their rescue, and your own saftie; when you come cleerein the tydes way, try it as before in the 4 article; the rest is referred to your own discretion, &amp; so I pray God for your safe returne.</P>

<P>This morning the Sun was vailed with drisling raine, I stood <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="Da"/> over for the N. shoare, the Master would have perswaded me to stand over for the S. saying the Capes on the S. which wee had seene were <HI>Savage</HI> Ilands, so named by <HI>Bylot,</HI> this being after wee had an observation, of 62 deg. 40 min. we had some<NOTE PLACE="marg">Variat. 29d.</NOTE> circumstance about it, but he went away well satisfied, and it proved as I tolde him, for at night wee had <HI>Savage</HI> Ilands N but noe land Northward in sight.

<P>The Sunne did rise cleare, at clocke 8 came on a Fogge, and <MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="Da"/> continued unto one, wee had store of ice to the S. off us, then it cleared and we were come to the Westward amongst much ice, and had sight of a high Iland, bearing W. about 6 or 7. leag. off, wee saw also the high land, of the N. maine, 12 leag. off. The Sun set valed, and we had no ground at 150 fath. it fell to raine, and I tooke in both topsailes, and stood to and a∣gaine among the Ice.</P>
<P>This morning was cold with some snow, and the W. wind <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="Da"/> blew hard, we made the ship fast, to a great peece of yce, which she plowed through the rest, by force of the Gale, although we had made her as snug as we could, at Noone we were in 63<NOTE PLACE="marg">Latit. 63 de 40 min.</NOTE> deg. 31 min. now the wind calmed, and I made loose, and

It seemeth these reasons had the force of perswasion, for wee willingly past about the Ile to the South, as well

where we found all over laid with ice, so that wee must make fast, having toyled thus all day untill night, I thought it fit to <MILESTONE N="July." UNIT="Moneths"/> repose.</P>
<P>This morning clocke 4. I called to make loose, wee <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="Da"/> had much to doe to get cleere being all fast immured it was easie wind, I could perceive by the bearing of the land that we had drove above 2 miles, S. wards; now wee thred∣needles to the East, hopeing at further distance from the Ile, to get cleare into the South channell; at clocke 10 the West winde brought on thick Fogges, so as we could not see one hole to peepe through; the ice inclosed us and there we lay, it blew hard untill clocke 7. then it both calmed and cleared. I loosed, and plying 2 leagues, to the South∣wards, had the South Maine in sight from the South-East to the S, West.</P>
<P>All this day, untill night 7. we kept our colde lodging, and <MILESTONE N="14" UNIT="Da"/> then looseing with an easie breath from N, E. we minne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd be∣twixt ice and ice S, Westward, untill we got cleare, in which time came under the sheering of our head (easie to have been strooke, if our provisions had beene ready) a Sea <HI>Vnicorne.</HI> He<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Sea Vni¦corne.</NOTE> was of length about 9 foot, black ridged, with a small fin ther∣on, his taile stoode crosse his ridge, and indented between the pickends, as it were on either side with 2 Scallop shels, his side dapled purely, with white and blacke, his belly all milke white, his shape from his gils to his taile, was fully like a Ma∣karell, his head like a to Lobster, wherout the fore-part grewe forth his twined horne above 6 foote long all blacke save the tip.

<P>This delicate morning the ice seemed to trent, from <HI>Salis∣buries</HI><MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="Da"/> Ile, into the middle channell, I caused the sailes to be clewed up, and lie untill <HI>Sols</HI> beautifull appearance, and at that fit opportunity, wet the lead in 60 fath.

<P>All this day the fog banks hath deceived mee, but now I am sure I see land, both the maine and Ilands, of which there are many, lying about 2 leagues into the Sea, all ragged and broken rocks within this land bore from N.

<P>The boat went on land at clocke 6. and stayed 3 glasses or one houre, and ½, in which time it flowed neere sixe foot, it was flood before they went, for while they were rowing to shore, I did observe it had flowed at least 3 foot, by certain rocks that were dry at our first approach, they say that it had about 9 foot to flow; at clocke 8. the tide returned, and set to S.

<P>Our men found stinking oyle in a fish gut, and some small Whale Finnes; this Iland I named Sir <HI>Thomas Rowes Wel∣come;</HI> I stood off into 33 fathomes that night, untill clocke 2, the wind West, for I was directed by the letter of my instru∣ction, to set the course from <HI>Carie Swannes Nest,</HI> N, W, by N. So as I might fall with the Westside, in 63 d. and from thence Southward, to search the passage diligently, all the Bay about, untill I came to <HI>Hudsons</HI> Bay.</P>
<P>I was in latitude 63 d. 37 m. plying up with S, W. winds,<MILESTONE N="28" UNIT="Da"/> very faire and cleare weather, I saw as it were a headland to the South, and petty Islands, and broken ground of the Maine, here was great store of fish leaping, and many Seales I saw one Whale, this day the land lyeth S.

<P>I stood W. about the headland, the last day shewed me, in 7 <MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="Da"/> and 8 fathomes, untill I raised another white Iland, bearing S. W. and betwixt that Iland the Maine, which I had now brought N. W. on me, there was as it had been a Caw see or

<P>After this it fell to be easie wind, I sent the boate to the land, and plyed with the ship, thereunto, for that wind which was, blew from thence, and comming neere it after Sunne-set, we could see 2 or three huge Whales, playing close by the land side, in shoale water; for we, without them in the ship, had but 12 fathomes, I stood to the S, W. end of the Island, and there stayed for my boat, which came at clocke 11 in the night, she had been 14 Glasses from the ship, which was thus imployed. <HI>Item,</HI> in Rowing to the land 4. one in chasing of Duckes, in the next, the water fell 9 Inches, and for 3 more in the one, it fell 3 Inches, in the other it flowed 3 Inches, and in the 2 last it flowed 2 foot ½, so as it flowed about 10 foot, but I doe trust to this.</P>
<P>In their comming on board, they Anchored in 8 fathomes at the Iland point, and that was 2 Glasses after, those formerly accounted, the Tide came from N E. and by E. at 3 miles ½ one houre, this point of the Iland made the Tyde goe sharpe; by this it may be gathered that it was full Sea at ½ past 12. it cannot be otherwise computated, but that it floweth here S: W. it being 3 dayes before the full Moone. But I am not<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. W.

<P>This Noble Knight graced me in the delivering of my Pe∣tition to his Majestie, and afterwards brought me to his Roy∣all Presence, there to shew the hopefull possibility of the at∣tempt.

And after this persisting in his kindnesse, invited mee to his owne Table, where I had my dyet, continually assisting <MILESTONE N="July."

<P>Being satisfied for what concerned this place, I weyed and stood to Sea in sixe fathomes the least water, fearing to deale any more within the Ilands, when I was cleare, I went to the old course againe S.

<P>The Master was in the boate, and had but 2 fathomes when they shot; all the water within us was shoald, so that then we were glad to wade forth, although the tyde was flood, it flowing 14 inches in two glasses, but in further examining I found no good account, onely this doth sustice, that as I range along the coast I do goe from the tide, and that it keepeth course, with the Moone, and that the further I speed from Sir <HI>Thomas Roes welcome,</HI> it still floweth lesse water, and the tides current is the easier; here on land the Mr. found, the reliques of a birch Cannowe, the footings and hornes of Deere, both small and great, and of fowle, an Arrowe headed with a nayle, the head beaten broad, and put into a shaft of 18 inches long, he thought it flowed about 7 foote, the floode began about clocke 8. I am sure it was slacke tyde at ship then and I will be slacke to write any more hereof, for I cannot season the reckoning taken on shoare.</P>
<P>After the boates comming on board, I stood off 3 glasses, to anchor in 13 fathome water (<HI>Hubbert</HI> makes me hope) for now I draw nere, here the tyde did set S, W. and by W. the ebbe E, and by South.</P>

</LIST>
<P>Thinking now it was good to provide for winter, for what is formerly done is so exact, as no discovery was more paine∣fully followed, nor with greater hazard, and lesse helpe; but God alone, besides the knowledge of this harbour might more embolden my men, in staying the longer forth to follow the Search.</P>
<P>Now betweene <HI>Port Nelson</HI> and <HI>Hudsons</HI> W.

<P>This Raynie morning with S. wind I stood in lowe sailes <MILESTONE N="9" UNIT="Da"/> with bonnets, along the S. side, which I take to be the plainer, and evener ground of the two.

<PB N="214" REF="106"/>
This night I had many gusts of Winde with showres of Raine.<MILESTONE N="August." UNIT="Moneths"/></P>
<P>I plide up a mile with flood, and thought to have gone be∣yond <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="Da"/> a point about 2 miles higher, where I might have ridde land lockt, but the river being full of stones, I grounded in the tides way, there being deepe now 5 fathomes, then 6 foote, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on 7 fathomes, so that espying a Wally in the clay cliffe on the North side, I sought and found a place of 5 fathomes to Anchor the Ship safely in, and intended, in the Vallie to set up my Pinnace. This river is on both sides full of small woods, the North side is a clay cliffe, like of that to the Nase in <HI>Essex,</HI> but not so high; the ship being moored I went on land, and found the Nallie very conve∣nient to set up a Tent and to build the Pinnace in, and here wee found some store of Hogsheads, and Pipestanes, which had beene yron bound, one Maine top, a top gallant Mast, di∣verse blocks, and the sides of stared chests, with divers reliques of some <HI>English</HI> Vessell, which I tooke to have perished, or beene left not farre from hence; and indeed I did assure my selfe, it must be that of Sir <HI>Thomas Buttons,</HI> but as yet I have not found a tree will make a Mayne yard.</P>
<P>This morning earely, I cald to rommage, for the percels <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="Da"/> of the Pinnace to be had on land, which being put into the boate, on land wee goe, the Carpenter at Sea had provi∣ded himselfe, of things necessarie against this occasion, have∣ing all materials in readinesse, which to further with his mate, I caused <HI>Peter Nesfeild</HI> quarter Master, the Cooper, the Gun∣ner, <HI>Expofer Russell,</HI> and my selfe to assist him, and this day wee set up the keele, and made a false keele to it, thinking thereby to make her hold a better wind, brought on all the ground timbers, and 3 strokes on each side, while the Mr. and others went to looke for refreshing.</P>
<P>The wind being come about to the N, N. I sent the Master word that it was fit to bring the ship to ground, while it blew from land, (as he determined before our comming in) and for that I would not have any thing to doe, that might stay mee after the Pinnace was set up, that such things as was needfull should be taken in hand and brought to passe with all expedi∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="106"/>This morning I was glad to bring the ship to land my selfe upon a fine smooth sand, against the Valley, where wee streng∣thened <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="Da"/><MILESTONE N="August:" UNIT="Moneths"/> on, the Cutwater, and tooke away the bolt which stucke out, and made smooth the Shipside, for any harme else our Anchors had done more to the sheathing then the yce, in this river we had set on side, a peece of our false keele which we helped.</P>
<P>And now I sent <HI>Samuell Blades,</HI> and the Chirurgion, to the E. to search the shoare, and to looke for a Mayne yard, who re∣turning told me, that for a Mayne yard there was not a tree to be had of that squarenesse, but that by a little creeke, about a mile off, they had found on, shoare certaine broken Anchors and cable rope, with other small ropes, also one broken Gun, with many round and crossebarre shot, of lead and yron, one Grapnet and store of firewood, pilde up, with one Tent co∣vered, with old sailes, and a Crosse which had beene set up but was puld or fallen downe, with the inscription raced out This night was very hot with much lightning and some drops of raine, here are comming in with the floode, and goeing out with the ebbe, innumerable company of white Whales, a fish as big as Porke fishes, with us and much alike in shape.</P>
<P>I went with the Cherurgion to the creeke, and found the <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="Da"/> same, as they had told mee, leaveing the Carpenters, and others at worke, and thinkeing to send for those things at the next leisure after the Shippe was Rummadgt; this Tyde did flowe nine foote, to floate the Shippe off ground.</P>
<P>This being the Lords day wee rested and served God,<MILESTONE N="14" UNIT="Da"/> the afternoone our men walked abroad to recreate them∣selves, and looke out for fresh releife, this night did the Ship fleete off, and wee moord her againe, in 3 fathomes, at lowe water.</P>

<P>This night 10. were many Pettiedancers, I hope faire wea∣ther to come, yet have wee had such as I pray our neighbours, in <HI>England</HI> have no worse, and then they cannot have better harvest weather to have in their crop, and though this may be thought nothing pertinent, to the History of a Sea Iournall yet having been disswaded from this voyadge, in respect of the ice; I may thus much write, for the incouragement of others that may happen to navigate this way, God giving good suc∣cesse to this enterprise, that a Sea voyage of discovery (to a place unknowne, and farre remote and in the like clime) can∣not be taken in hand with more health, ease, and pleasure; I am sure it hath beene warme ever since we came from the yce.</P>
<P>The wind came about, I sent the Pinnace on land, to bal∣last,<MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="Da"/> and to bring one broad stone, to make a fire upon in her, which I had formerly marked for that purpose, at Port <HI>Nelson</HI> they found a board broken in two, the one halfe quite gone, whereon had beene the Kings Armes, and inscription of the time of Sir <HI>Thomas Button</HI> his owne name, when and why he tooke Harbour with other expressions.</P>

<P>Was thicke close weather, at night 7 it wet, the night <MILESTONE N="27" UNIT="Da"/> proved close, the wind changed from N. W. to S. E. the land lay S.

standing in towards the shoare, which was in sight, but stan∣ding <MILESTONE N="August."

<P>There came on board of mee, his Lieutenant, his Coxen, and three more; I gaue order to my Officers to take downe the 4. rowers betweene the Decks, and to entertaine them at seuerall messes, and to enquire of them with what land, they fell first, after their comming from our owne Coasts, what lands they had beene at, or in what harbours, when they entered <HI>Fretum, Hudson,</HI> how long they had beene amongst the Ice, and at se∣uerall times, what Islands they had seene, or Capes formerly discouered, what was there most Northerliest latitude, they had beene in, and what day they see first this side or bottome, and in what latitude they came ouer this bay in: I enquired al∣so the like of his Lieutenant, whom I entertained in my Cabin, so that before they went away, I heard that they first met with Ice, at Cape <HI>Farwell,</HI> and that they entered <HI>Fretum Hudson,</HI> the 20. day of <HI>Iune;</HI> they had beene distrest in harbour, and had like to haue lost their shippe, the fire smoake my men see on land the 23. day of <HI>Iune</HI> was theirs; they had seene the Iles <HI>Not∣tingham</HI> and <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and was on land on Sir <HI>Robert Mans∣fells</HI> Isle, hauing beforebeene sore pestured with Ice: The grea∣test latitude North was 64. deg. and that in this bay of Sir <HI>Thomas Buttons,</HI> they had beene troubled with Ice, talking thereof as though they tooke pleasure to runne against it, nay, they said they had runne into the Ice, as far as the maine mast, and that they came ouer in 59 deg. of this their Northmost la∣titude, of their suffering at <HI>Resolution,</HI> their grounding in this Bay, the harme of their men, throwne at <HI>Capsten,</HI> and what else I desired to haue, I had, and that they had him on shoare here, but two dayes before, and kill'd two Partridges, they said also that there was no offering to goe home, if they found no passe∣age, for that the Ice could not bee disolued this yeere, but they must stay vntill the next yeere, to haue light nights to shift

themselues amongst them, and this I did for that I did not know how wee might be separated, beefore I talked with Cap.<MILESTONE N="August." UNIT="Moneths"/><MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="Da"/> <HI>Iames</HI> himselfe, and I gaue order to acquaint them, with what also they demanded of vs, telling them that I had beene in Port <HI>Nelson,</HI> and that I had seene, and came along this coast, neuer without sight of land, from the latitude of 64 deg. 2. quar. and that in Port <HI>Nelson,</HI> I had beene on the S. side, and on the land also, before they came; and had named it new <HI>Yorkeshiere,</HI> but being a barren waste Wildernesse of Birds, and wild beasts of prey (and chiefely for that it is out of the roade of trading, and the passage) where none hereafter will desire to come: I conceine that I can haue no great honour thereby, (although I haue giuen it a name) and therefore doe leaue it to those that are disposed to intitle themselues therein.</P>
<P>Last night I made loose and stood along in small sailes vn∣till <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="Da"/> this day 10 moosling my ship with the fore-saile; I then stood fot Captaine <HI>Iames,</HI> who was a great way on sterne; at his comming vp, hee sent his shallop on board of mee; who at much perswasion of my Master (although much against my<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goon bord the <HI>Maria.</HI></NOTE> will) I tooke them in, they rowing mee on board (to bee better confirmed) I did begin to reiterate the last Eue∣nings discourse, they had aboard of mee, to the end I might vnderstand the difference of seuerall reports (for euery man will report the best of his owne Actions) but the conclu∣sion was, that they came ouer, and fell in land with this bay in 59 deg. I was well entertained and feasted by Captaine <HI>Iames,</HI> with varietie of such cheere as his Sea prouisions could aford, with some Partridges, wee dined betwixt decks, for the great cabin was not bigg enough to receiue our selues and followers; during which time the ship butt in 2 Courses, and maine bon∣net, threw in so much water, as wee could not haue wanted sause, if wee had had roast Mutton.</P>
<P>Whereat I began to ponder whether it were better for his company to bee impounded amongst Ice, where they might be kept from putrifaction, by the piercing ayre, or in open Sea, to be kept sweete by being thus daily pickled; howeuer they were to be pittied; the ship taking her liquor as kindly as our selues, for her nose was no sooner out of the pitcher, but her nebe like the Ducks, was in't againe: The Gentleman could discourse of Arte, as obseruations, calculations, and the like, and shew∣ed

me many Instruments, so that I did perceiue him to bee a practitioner in the Mathematicks, but when I found that hee <MILESTONE N="August." UNIT="Moneths"/> was no Sea-man, I did blame those very much, who had coun∣celled him to make choyce of that shippe, for a voyage of such importance, for to indure two winters in, as hee must haue done, if hee had any such intent, before hee could come about by <HI>Bonu Sperance</HI> home: our discourse had beene to small pur∣pose, if wee had not pried into the errours of our predecessors, (and being demanded) I did not thinke much for his keeping out his flagg; for my ambition was more Aetheriall, and my thoughts not so ayerie, so to set my sight towards the skie, but when I either call'd to God, or made Celestiall obseruation; to this was replide, that hee was going to the Emperour of <HI>Iapon,</HI> with letters from his Maiestie, and that if it were a ship of his Maiesties of 40 Peeces of Ordnance, hee could not strike his flag (keepe it vp then quoth I) but you are out of the way to <HI>Iapon,</HI> for this is not it: hee would haue perswaded mee to take harbour to winter in, telling mee that Sir <HI>Thomas Button</HI> tooke harbour the 14 of this instant; Quoth I, hee is no precedent for mee, I must paralell my pouerty with poore <HI>Hud∣sons,</HI> who tooke no harbour before the first of <HI>Nouember;</HI> and that then I durst not take harbour vntill the midst of the same, besides I was not come to do so much as another man, but more then any, as I had already done, and i (I did forbeare him in this, or any other thing, it was because I was on board of him, and had made some former obseruation, of which I acquainted my Master with, that thereby wee might the better brooke, what might bee offered, as boasting of our selues, or the like, for it was enough for vs, that wee had so great odds in the dis∣couery, hee said I was to winter; I told him hee had the coppy of my Commission, as also of all my letters, that I was limmi∣ted) but so as hauing sought all this bay, from 64.2 quar. to 60 leag.

and this 17 houres, was the worst spent of any time of my dis∣couery. My men told me his men gaue them some Tobacco, a <MILESTONE N="August." UNIT="Moneths"/> thing good for nothing.</P>
<P>Whilest wee were on board of Captaine <HI>Iames,</HI> wee stood <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="Da"/> off into the Sea; the Mary in two courses and one bonnet, and the Charles but in maine course and Bonnet, yet went faster then the Mary:</P>
<P>I came on board with the Mary early this morning, wee <MILESTONE N="31" UNIT="Da"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Came from a∣bord Captaine <HI>Iames.</HI></NOTE> made fast our pinnes, and set saile; I called to take my leaue, as I came by him (for I could ouer-hale him, as the winding of a Clew) but his men told me, that he was in his Cabbin, I gaue him 10 Musquets, one Falconet, and presently I haled in, to the land, for wee were 8 leagues off by account, and in 36 fathoms deepe, it was morning, 6. when wee parted, at 10. I had the land faire by; I stood S, W. in, for that I knew I could see so farr, to the W. ward, as I was when wee both stood off, I bore as much saile (vntill I had the land bould) as the Ship and masts was able to stand vnder, and all the time I had the Maria in sight, I did obserue that shee went away, S. or S.

<P>This morning earlie, was the ankor vpon the bow, and I <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Da"/> stood into 3. fathomes, of the shoare, still trenting to the E.

heere was thicke Riuer-water, and small drift wood, such as v∣sually driue out of Riuers, without whose monthes lie alwayes <MILESTONE N="August." UNIT="Moneths"/> shelues, barres, or ridges; I did now account I was about 105. leagues E, S, E. on this side Port <HI>Nelson.</HI></P>
<P>This day being thwart the land, I sawe yesterday when I supposed it: the W. point of some River, or else the winding of the land to S. wards, and could see no land to the E. of the same. I made motion at dinner, for the N. W. (to the Master and his mate) declaring that now all this vndiscovered land, betwixt M. <HI>Hudsons</HI> &amp; Sr. <HI>Thomas Buttons,</HI> was now perfectly finished by vs; for that the land now trenting from this Cap, S. ward, must assuredly bee the cheeke of Mr. <HI>Hudson</HI> his West∣bay, as may appeare by those Maps, brought whome by <HI>Bylot,</HI> after he was exposed, and now the further search of a passage, this way was hopelesse, and their needed no more search, in all the side of this Bay. From 64. deg. 30 m. circularly to 55. deg. 10 m. and seeing that we could not attempt the N. W. from <HI>Notinghams</HI> Ile (as I was instructed) for the heavie quan∣titys of Ice, which had choaked all the 3. channels; at our ente∣ring in the midle of <HI>Iuly,</HI> now I did hope were disolved, or els never, and it was best to make tryall thereof, whilest this good wind lasted, and withall charged them with their promise made, at my parting from <HI>Notinghams,</HI> which was to haue seene a tryall before their going home, at what danger soever, (though then there was no attempting) if no passage proves else-weere, and to this same purpose, did wish mee to write what I would, and they would set their hands thervnto, which for some concealed reason I did manifest, shewing them also that we had long time to spend, for Mr. <HI>Hudson</HI> did not har∣bour vntill the first of <HI>November,</HI> and for <HI>S. Thomas Button</HI> hee <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Da"/> was constrained: and that I was not to obserue any precedent of that nature, for I was not come to see what my predecessors had done, but to doe more; either finde the <HI>Passage,</HI> or bring home a good account, which I could not doo, if I did not speed my Commissionith what hast I could, and for harbouring there was none vntill the midest of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>Now how I shall spend all this time, and bee able to giue that account, his Majestie doth expect, I know not, if I do not goe to the N W. For besides it I am not instructed to search, which being put into practice, if it proue not to be had there,
<PB N="226" REF="112"/>
but that the land doth stretch to the E. as <HI>Baffine</HI> reports in 65.<MILESTONE N="September." UNIT="Moneths"/> deg. 25 m. then they account will be satisfied, and we may re∣tourne in short time, for this is not aboue sixe dayes worke, if God please this S. winde shall stand, and we may come downe betwixt <HI>Sr. Dudlies Diggs Ile,</HI> and Cape <HI>Wolstenholme,</HI> into the bottome of Mr. <HI>Hudsons</HI> E. <HI>Bay,</HI> and there winter. Which if we doe, we must stay vntill <HI>August,</HI> as experience had shewne vs. (Which was neere a whole 11. months) and therefore now would be the best: but to write truth, the Mr. would giue no consent, but to keepe all safe by seeking for harbour, but his mates answere was.</P>
<P>Captaine, if there bee any thing more to be done? let vs fall to it, whilest the wind is good, so grace being said, I came foroth and weering out the maine sheate, commaunded him at helme to goe away N. E. by E. when comming more open <HI>Hudsons</HI> Bay, the winde at S. blowing, but to both top-sailes on taunt, there came so high a Sea from S.

<P>I named the Cape I last parted from, <HI>Wolstenholmes vlti∣mum vale,</HI> for that I do beleeue Sr. <HI>Iohn Wolstehholme</HI> will not lay out any more monies in search of this Bay. And yet thus much, if he had beene wanting heerein; I am of opinion, that the most of those discoveries, had never beene attempted: for my owne part I can say, for so I find, that he hath been, for 8. Voyages the principall adventurer in stocke (and Treasrror) supplying the slacke adventure, when the stocke came slowly in, and I dare affirme, concerning this Voyage of mine; that he was at least 400. l. out at my home comming, although I did retourne in 6. compleate monethes: saving 12. monthes vituall and pay, and besides, I am confident, that hee cannot bee lesse out then 1100 l. about this discovery.</P>
<P>Yet I am perswaded that vpon good grounds (of which I doe knowe him to bee very able to judge) that no subject in this kingdome parrallelling his degree, would sooner advance

to the furtherance of this, or any other designe of such worth, which hee thinkes may redownd to his Majesties honour, and <MILESTONE N="September." UNIT="Moneths"/> his countries good.</P>

<P>Comming neere vnto this Cape, I see many ouer-falls, and ra∣ces in the Tides face, being deeper, &amp; with more breacke then heretofore, so as I caused an ankor to bee made ready, hauing then 20. fathomes, but before I came to the first ouer-fall, I had but 7. 8. 10. differing as fast as the lead went down: I anchor∣ed in 8. the Cape bore S.

This day and night was fayre weather, the one by sight of the Sun, the other by the Moone, although the wind came against our wils, to the S, E. by S. with a frostie fog, turning up to the North land it was cleare, but at Sea it was thicke, and thus plying up to the Eastward, came within 4 leagues, of this land, which lay from East to N, N, E. and was the same, wee drived along, immured amongst the Ice; at our en∣trance inwards, wee got little by plying with contrary winds, and yet I durst not put into a Sound for harbour, of which wee might perceive some, as also Roade-steeds made by Ilands, lying nere the Mayne, our weather side was froze, as also all our ropes were a quarter of an inch thicke about.</P>

<P>This first day it blew lesse wind, but all the morning was <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="Da"/><MILESTONE N="October."

<P>These 2 dayes were spent in plying to the E. sometimes in <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Da"/> the sight of the N. land, or Maine, whereof lay 2 small Ilands <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="Da"/> which we drive by, as I drive inwards, being then fast a∣mongst the ice; at 12 this day I tacked to the S. wards, and at this instant the said land-bore from N, W. by W. to the E. the Iland at the N. end, by estimation was one league distant from the Maine, that at the E. was 2 off.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>1 I had been immured with Ice, from the first day of my en∣tering <HI>Fretum Hudson,</HI> being the 23 day of Iune, vntill the 4 of Iuly following, after which time, I got cleere, and comming unto <HI>Salisbury Isle,</HI> I lay fast againe betweene the South and the North Maine, about 7 dayes amongst ice, where being neere the said Isle I could easily discerne the Tyde come from the East, through <HI>Fre∣tum Hudson▪</HI> and not from the Northwest.</P>
<P>2 Getting cleere of the ice, I trent about the said Isle to the South, as also <HI>Nottinghams,</HI> where sending the Boat on land, brought word that it had flowed so much water, as in my Iournall is mentioned of, and that the water had more to flowe, and after that running off into 60 fathomes, and anchoring the Boat, I found the Tyde come from the South-East or through <HI>Fretum Hudson.</HI></P>
<P>3 Standing along the said Isle to W. ward, untill I brought the same, I meane the W. end N. E. it began to be full of ice, in the W. Channell, betwixt <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Shark Point,</HI> as before be∣twixt the North Maine and <HI>Salisbury,</HI> so as the Master his Mate, and my selfe conclude, that there was no entring the said Northwest▪ as yet, or untill the ice was dissolved; and to that point, the Master and Mate, wished me to write what I would concerning that impossibility of passage untill the ice were gone, and they would signe the same, promising that they would bee wil∣ling to see the same, before their going home, if no passage proved elsewhere to be found.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>Whereupon considering, that that Tyde came not from the North-West for certaine, which is the absolute ground of my instructions, but from South-East, disproved also by Master <HI>Bylot,</HI> (who was in the same Voyage and ship,
<PB N="246" REF="122"/>
with Sir <HI>Thomas Button</HI>) saying that both he and all his Com∣pany, did plainely see the Tyde come from S. E. at Cape <HI>Com∣fort,</HI> and also the Ile <HI>Nottingham,</HI> averring that they which tooke that account were mistaken, in the time, taking 8 a clocke for 10.</P>
<P>Now as it was not possible as yet to enter for ice, the wind being liberall I directed the course towards <HI>Carie Swan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Nest,</HI> hoping to follow the instructions, in the search of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣tons</HI> and <HI>Hudsons</HI> Bay, (of which there was as great hopes as at the Northwest, and were there as many, and as strongly of that opinion, as of the other) and come backe againe thi∣ther, by that time the ice was dissolved, which I hoped would be about the fine of <HI>August</HI> or not at all; if no passage proved in the said Bay to be had, but finding none▪ I proceeded from that search, having first finished the search of the foresaid Bay as followeth in briefe.</P>
<P>Being come out of <HI>Hudsons</HI> Bay, and Anchoring at <HI>Sharke Point,</HI> I found the Ebbe to goe with good Current from the West, but the South-East flood Tyde did slacke the same, when it came, but how it did flow and what water I cannot report for want of my journall, it being now out off my hands, but I did finde the same flood-tide to answere the re∣port of Master <HI>By<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> journall writ by <HI>Baffin;</HI> and I found some quantity of ice betweene Cape <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and <HI>Sharkes Point</HI> undesolved at that time, being the foureteenth of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>Having made those observations, I stood over (with North-winds) for <HI>Mill I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land</HI> mentioned in my inst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucti∣ons, but for no intent to coast the East-side, for I had with that wind much adoe to fetch the same, with bording and turning under the South side of it, two Tides before I got in∣to a Throughlet, at the West end thereof, whereinto I put, and there found it to flow at least foure fathomes. The Tide running halfe Tyde, and comming from South-East, as well upon the North and Southside, as upon the South of <HI>Notting∣ham</HI> at my departure from thence, whereupon I plied up with North-West windes every Tyde, being forced to stoppe the Ebbe, nor could I recover the West side with those winds, untill I attained the Cape I have called <HI>Lord Westo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Port∣land</HI>
<PB N="247" REF="122"/>
in the latitude about 66 d. 47 m. where I found the Tyde of flood to come still along as the coast did lie, which was to coast from Northwest to North, to Northeast and to East, and to Southeast the deepest water not above 30 fa∣thomes (as I remember) five leagues from land, the Sea slight and smooth with these winds, so as it is easie to con∣jecture thereof, either ice or land was not farre off, for wee found good store of undesolved ice at <HI>Sharke Poynt,</HI> whereupon I stood 10 leagues from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence (as I supposed) for the Westside which I could not attaine, and if I had continued this course, for the West side, with this winde, I must have stopt the Ebbes, and <HI>Baffin</HI> writing of 130 fathomes deepe there, the just length of my small cable-shoat, I must have bid the ship to have stoopt for the rest, and to have done the same by my biggest, I had not strength enough to have wayed the same from ground againe, likewise I had no reason to follow the East finding it to Trent away South East from that Headland, which for resemblance and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mile, to this of ours. I named <HI>L. Westons Portland,</HI> from whence I doe per∣swade my selfe, the Ebbe doth take his halfe course, through those Ilands of <HI>Cumberlands</HI> into <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retum `Davis,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood cannot bee great (which conjecture may say should come through that straight, and meet ours at <HI>Portland</HI>) being hindred by these foresaid Iles▪ where <HI>Davis</HI> saith hee met a strange Tyde from the South-West, may be the cause, which by that straightnesse may retort the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loods way.</P>
<P>But to the purpose, the winds were North-west, nor could I stay the change thereof, for the most of my best men, as Master, Gunner, Carpenter, Boatswaine his Mate, and one or two of the common men were downe, the rest complaining of cold paines, and no marvell, they having beene over-toyled in the bottome of Sir <HI>Thomas Buttons</HI> Bay, (and that undiscovered betwixt him and <HI>Hudson</HI>) with watching and warding day and night, manning both Shippe, Boate, and Pinnace, both in Anchoring and Sayling (but especially at Leade, when in all the time of my Sayling the said Bay, there was never one from keeping the same.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="123"/>The weather had beene for about 3 weekes before, no∣thing but Snow, Frost, and sleet at best, our selves, ropes, and sayles froaze, the Sunne seldome to be seene or once in five dayes, the nights 13 houres long, the Moone wayning, and in conclusion, I was enforced either to seeke for Harbour, or freeze to death in the Sea.</P>
<P>Whereupon I sent Master <HI>Ʋrine,</HI> to aske the Masters opi∣nion, who brought unto me, that he thought the Tydes setting from S. E. almost round about to E. would give good satisfa∣ction (for this N. W. search, begun by a wrong report of the Tydes comming from thence) to the Adventurers, and that hee helde it fittest to returne. Yea, and the best also, as I thought, and homewards, and for good cause as hereafter fol∣loweth.</P>
<P>First, I referre it to the judgment of indifferent men, whe∣ther having proceeded in these Discoveries, further then any other my Predecessors, in lesse time, and at lesse charge, have closed up all the expected hopes upon the W. side of <HI>Buttons</HI> Bay, from 64½ circularly to 55, and on the Point from <HI>Swans Nest,</HI> to <HI>Sharke Point,</HI> not perfectly discovered but now by mee, and carried a Tyde, comming from South-East through <HI>Fretum Hudson,</HI> all along that East side to 66 degrees 30 minutes, or thereabouts, (things not knowne heretofore) that I should hazzard the losse thereof to my Countrey, If I should have perished in seeking an unknowen Harbour, in long nights and cold weather, with so many men sicke, who could not have recovered in the wintering, howsoever their helpes would have beene wanting, in lying, or Barracadoing the ship from ice, for wheresoever I had wintered, I must have h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led the ship high on shore, and Barracadoe; as also in making my provisions of fresh victuals, and fuell. The necessitie of this, Sir <HI>Thomas Button</HI> is able to approve to his deare bought experiment.</P>
<P>Well, if I had wintered it must have beene with intent to make search, to the North of Sir <HI>Tho. Roes Welcome,</HI> for in all the hopefull places else I was denyed, and there, and not far frō thence, as about <HI>Vtultra,</HI> it is, for to give a wise Gentlemā his right (who perusing Sir <HI>Tho. Buttons</HI> journall about that place, quoteth in the Margent) these words, I doe not find <HI>it is proved a Bay,</HI> this was suspected by him before, I came to
<PB N="249" REF="123"/>
that knowledge thereof, which I have now, but to proceed, how should I be able to doe this service, when the winter would have consumed all the best of my comfortable stores, as strong Beere, strong waters, sacke, spice, fruite, Rice, Wheat meale, and of my Chirurgery; and if no releife had beene o∣therwise got from land, to have lengthened the most of the provision, as Beefe, Beere, and Fish.</P>
<P>Yet had I had no more then would have brought home the Ship, if my men had stood, and if by their death, or reliefe of birds or Deere, I had store remaining, yet I doubt the remay∣ning stomacks, would have beene too weake (before the long winter there had left them) to have endured salt meate in the Summer, so as the more victuall the fewer hands for labour, and there would be no sparing as I conceived by short allow∣ance.</P>
<P>All these and many other sufferings endured, is but all for the next yeares Search, about which I have shewed, I had no reason to stay, to put so much to hazzard knowing what I had inquired from some, both of Sir <HI>Thomas Button,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hud∣sons</HI> men of their sufferings, and yet it was <HI>July,</HI> before they could get well to sea to returne home. And it doth appeare by Sir <HI>Thomas Buttons</HI> owne words, that he would have procee∣ded the next yeare if he had not been disabled.</P>
<P>For when, after my home comming, I told him hee could not be certaine of the Tyde he tooke at <HI>Notingham,</HI> was true; for that his boate was never on land, his answere was (God a mercy for nothing) for I had not above 8 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound men; so this doth appear as I did cōceive, before my returne. I cōclude that these things in part knowne to me, in part imagined, that if I should not have made good use thereof, having discovered so much as I had done, if I would thus have suffered, I had bin well served, to have come home unpittied.</P>

<P>There is also 6 Months pay and victuals saved at above 75 pounds per month, amounting to the some of nere 450 poū. and if they doe not set forth the next yeare, then there is 11 months pay and victuals saved, there is one Sommers time gai∣ned, for if this be distrusted or more required (I meane in dis∣covery) who is so pleased may set forth the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> and satisfie their desire this next yeare, with ship new∣ly repaired, newly manned with fresh men, &amp; untainted with skurvie, crampe or cold paines, but more and better able to performe, the enterprize, then the Winterer can be.</P>
<P>To conclude I referre it to the judgement of reasonable dis∣cretion, whether it may be held fit, that I should suffer, either by want of liberty, good reward or imputation (as hath been wished) untill the returne of Capt. <HI>James,</HI> who had no intent as by his answer doth appeare, who when I inquired of him, why he being so late had not attempted the N, W. as we both were instructed, answered that <HI>Baffine</HI> satisfied in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our∣nall, that the Tyde came from S, E. and that himselfe had beene no more N. then 64. the latit of Mill Ile, and then having come over to the W. side of Sir <HI>Thomas Buttons</HI> Bay, but in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. and discovered but from thence to 61 leag.

Ranke (in his conceite, for I have heard since that his ambi∣tion hath abused my worth and name) I told him my further intent, which was to attempt the N, W. this yeare, all which to do he must stay the next yeare, as my selfe would, if he had left me in the like case, nor can no unkindnesse be laid to my charge for not bringing of letters from him, taking a fayre farwell of him, for he had time enough in two dayes to have writ, nor was I certaine as then of my returne, which now I doe thanke God for. If this will satisfie to stop the mouth of Rumor, which hath already touched too much vpon my de∣serts, I shall bee glad; otherwise, I wish they would suffer themselves to be judged by performing the like labour.</P>
<P>These rumours like ill Newes ridde poast, for they came to Court; insomuch as comming by Boate with a Gentleman from <HI>Oatlands</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> where I had beene to deliver my Accompts to his Majesty, it pleased the Gentleman to say, that now is Captaine <HI>James</HI> in the <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> and will come home by Cape <HI>Bon Sperance.</HI></P>
<P>I was so confident that he could doe no more for that yeare I did leave him, and for the yeare to come, that I replyed with three wishes or desires to my good or ill.</P>
<P><HI>The first was, that if Captaine</HI> Iames <HI>did passe through and come home that way, that I might be severely punished according as I did acknowledge I did deserve.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The next was, that if at his home-comming,</HI> (for which I pray∣ed vnto Almighty God,) <HI>that it did appeare vpon examination</HI> (equally ballanced) <HI>that hee had done as much as I and no more, I might have reasonable Reward, for so I had deserved.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The third, that if hee had not done so much, that I might be re∣warded with what I had saved, to wit; Eleven moneths victuall and pay, at 75. pounds</HI> per <HI>Moneth, and according to the wearing and tearing of Cordage and Tackling that I had saved, which hee would spend.</HI></P>
<P>Now since hee is returned home, and hath neyther beene through nor performed so well as I by very much, I desire to be rewarded as before; and for that this was rehearst before his home-comming, and when I did not know where hee was.</P>

<HEAD>That there is a Passage, hath beene proffered to be proued very Learnedly by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Humphrey Gilbert</HI> Knight, foure severall wayes, as followeth.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THe first by Authority, alledging</HI> America <HI>to bee that Iland called by</HI> Plato <HI>and others</HI> Atlantes, <HI>sayled vnto by the</HI> Car∣thagineans, <HI>and that it is bound on the East by the</HI> Atlanticke <HI>sea from which it is named, on the South by</HI> Magelan <HI>straights, on the West by</HI> Mar del Zur, <HI>on the North it is severed from</HI> Groenland <HI>by the Sea, through which the Passage doth lye. And to confirme the former Discovery, he brings in Money found by the</HI> Spaniards <HI>in the Gold mines of</HI> America, <HI>having the stampe of</HI> Augustus Caesar, <HI>and since that time the discontinuance hath beene, for that it hath beene swallowed vp and overflowen with water through a mighty Earthquake, so as the Navigation thereunto was since that time lost, vntill the yeare</HI> 1492. <HI>that</HI> Columbus <HI>did after discover the same,</HI> (although <HI>Malga</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was be∣fore him) <HI>pretending that since its appearance againe, the Seas about it are made deeper, and the Northwest made more easie to be sayled, confirming the Conclusion by the Cosmographers of those moderne times, especially</HI> Ortelius, <HI>who maketh both</HI> Groenland <HI>and</HI> America <HI>both Ilands, dis-joyned by a great Sea from any part of</HI> Asia.</P>
<P><HI>The second is by Reason; for sayling from</HI> Iseland <HI>to where this Freet should be, its thought to bee more deeper water, and that if</HI> America <HI>were not an Iland, it and</HI> Asia <HI>should participate of each others animals, or things of like shape or condition as Men, Beasts, and others, of which there hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in found in eyther; also hee alled∣geth, the Seas naturall and circular running from the East <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o West.

<P>It is now probable that this Tyde of the S. Channell, com∣ming from the East, is not an end; and that Tyde on the North is turned away▪ as I have found by experience at <HI>Ca∣rie Swannes Nest.</HI></P>
<P>Standing from hence 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> leagues into the latitude of 64<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood.</NOTE> 10 m. which is to the North of that high land called <HI>Hopes Advan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d,</HI> I found a Tyde setting from the North, as the land did their coast which Tyde did flood above 20 foote water, in the dead neepe, (as it was at my being there) and that it did runne halfe tide being full Sea about clocke 11. So as a∣bout a W. S. W.

<P>The next is to inquire from whence this Tyde should come, for that is the way to the passage, for it cannot be said to come from the East through <HI>Fretum Hudson,</HI> for there need no more to disprove that then what went before, when that Tyde did end at <HI>Carie Swans Nest,</HI> in flowing but 6 foote
<PB N="260" REF="129"/>
and 4 houres, as it doth at the height, of all Rivers being farre from the Sea.</P>
<P>Should it come from the North, then it should as well Cur∣rent that land on the East side of this Bay to <HI>Carie Swans Nest</HI> along that small distance of 40 leagues, if such a thing be at all or no, as upon the West side. For, 250 leagues of now knowne discovery setting from the North, it should divide equall waters betwixt them, which is found to the con∣trary, and if such land doth lie 40 leagues along from <HI>Swannes Nest</HI> Westward, then is there not aboue 30 more for the brenth of the passage, frō through whence this ride doth come which I should thinke were to narrow to let in and out so much water in the time mentioned; to bring any flood on this side, now in handling, for at <HI>Swannes Nest</HI> the flood set West, and the Ebbe East; and if this Tyde going West, were met with more water, from thence, it must flow extraordinarily high at the Nest (as in great Rivers in time of land-waters, the Sea flood meeting, puts up the waters to such heights, as doth inforce all their bounds) and rejected the Tydes course, which I found to be constant, for that I was there two floods one ebbe and a halfe.</P>
<P>How can it now be imagined but that the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de doth come from the West, and so coasteth along the same side, as wee may observe upon all Tydes from what sea soever they come, looke upon what side they enter, they Current the same, and so doth this, for that called <HI>Vtultra,</HI> never proved Bay yet, and who hath named the same, might as well be deceived here as at other places by fogs, bankes, for if this part be protracted, I cannot see that there is any discovery made at all on both sides (betweene <HI>Hubarts vaine hope,</HI> and <HI>Swanne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nest</HI>) worth the noting.</P>
<P>Therefore it must be confest that this Tyde doth come from the West, so inclining to that shore, and that it is a Tide hath been proved, for I doe not thinke that there's any that will pretend inundating, impulsing, or ingulfing, and that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Instruction</NOTE> it doth proceed from some great Ocean, is without all con∣tradiction; for comming to this West side, I found great store of fish playing at the crust of the water, and of great fish which is a maine argument, for there was Whales, Sea-mors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whales, Sea mors.</NOTE> and Seales, of which there are infinite, which fish doe not
<PB N="261" REF="129"/>
hive in Winter but in deepe Oceans, and that those Whales must come from the West, is certaine, for all the way from Cape <HI>Farewell,</HI> in all that distance of neere 500 leagues; we did not see one untill I came there, which if there had beene any lying so long becalmed and amongst the ice, having light nights, we should have seene them, for they are fish that affect to play and breath above the water.</P>
<P>The maine land was high within Sir <HI>Thomas Roes Wel∣come,</HI> as in all the straights besides, with deepe water to shore, whereas discovering Southwards, it fell to bee low land with shallow shore, at 11 fathoms, wee could but see it upon the hatches. This is much contrary to the Oceans, who are bounded with high mountainous climes, steepe Promonto∣ries, ragged Rockes, and inamoled Ilands, subsisting upon in∣searchable deepes, salt, and greene-coloured waters, wherein live the great sishes.</P>
<P>Now let us compare this Tyde with some others neerer our owne home, with which we are the most familiar; as to begin at the mouth of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> towards which, two Tydes resort.</P>
<P>And at the mouth thereof it floweth a S. and N. Moone, at the S. Foreland, S▪ S. E. in the Channell of the <HI>Ile of Wight,</HI> S. E. or S. E. by S. at <HI>Plimmouth</HI> E. at the Gulfe where the Ocean doth first enter our Channell, E. N. E▪ this reckoning goeth against the Sunne and Moone, yet this is the way to finde the Sea from whence the tide doth come.</P>
<P>Likewise, along stthe North coast, there commeth another tide to the saide River bringing the like flowing, and al∣most answerable at the same distance, for from off <HI>Harwich,</HI> it floweth S. S. E. at <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> S. E. at <HI>Laresnesse,</HI> E. by N. at <HI>Whitby,</HI> N. E. at <HI>Barwick,</HI> N. N. E. at <HI>Backha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nesse</HI> N. by E. in <HI>Orkney</HI> N. Now we know that both those Tydes, the one from the North, the other from the West, came both out of the Westerne Ocean, and that from the North by the lands trenting his channell, his Current from the West Eastwards, to S. E. as at <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmouth</HI> to S. S. E. as at St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> W. to S. E. as at <HI>Hambrough,</HI> to S. as at <HI>Hull</HI> to S.

<P>So as here it is made manifest, that both Tydes comming out<NOTE PLACE="marg">As West in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> y<SUP>•</SUP> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n of <HI>Thames.</HI></NOTE> of the Western Ocean E, doth in the end goe or set just against

Now it is prooved that the course time and change of this Tyde doth correspond with all other Ocean Tydes, it running also halfe Tyde, (which is the floods running still the way of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood, untill it be halfe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bbe on shore, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bbe running likewi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e his course, in continuance untill the water bee halfe flowed upon the shore) so as it cannot be said to want any joynt or member of an Oceans flood, but may rightly bee tearmed a limme thereof.</P>
<P>It may be objected that although by all likely hood that is a passage, yet it may prove to be a great distance to saile through, and how shall a man doe to know when he is thorow, that thereby he may direct his course Southward.</P>
<P>I answere it can be no great distance, for that the water doth heighten in Spring-Tydes, almost as much water at Sir <HI>Thomas Roes Welcome</HI> in the Spring Tydes, as at C. <HI>Warwicke</HI> which standeth in the edge of the <HI>Hyperborion</HI> Ocean, and therefore how can this Tyde come farre from his sea, and bring constantly as much water as it floweth in any place that standeth neere the Oceans lips; How can then the <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> be farre from hence, for the distance betweene Cape <HI>Warwicke</HI> and <HI>Swans Nest,</HI> is not above 200 leagues where this Tydes quite consumed, so at the like distance from Sir <HI>Thomas Roes Welcome,</HI> This new Tyde along that Bay holds the same untill in the bottome thereof, it be consumed, for I have heard from some, that if North winds doth not inforce the Tydes that they doe not flow above two foot in <HI>Hudson<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> E. and W. Bay,</P>
<P>Me thinketh there is three materiall proofes that maketh better for our purpose, for to answere and free this doubt, though all the rest of Sir <HI>Humphrey Gilbert</HI> and Master <HI>Wills,</HI> makes for the passage.</P>
<P>The first is that the Cosmographers of <HI>China</HI> doe extend their coasts to the N. E. even to the 50 d. of latitude, and may doe further for any thing they know.</P>
<P>The second is <HI>Paul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ʋenetus,</HI> that lived there, and sayled from <HI>Catta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 1500 leagues North-East, and might have gone further for any land he see.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="131"/>The 3. is <HI>Barnard la Tore,</HI> the 4, may be the ships found by <HI>Francis▪ Wasques</HI> at <HI>Sierra Nevado</HI> not being of <HI>America</HI> but were a moneth in comming thither from <HI>Asia,</HI> all making that this passage cannot be long, for that they of <HI>Asia</HI> extend the breadth of their country so farre to East.</P>
<P>Beside <HI>Francisco Gaule</HI> the Spanish Pylot reports of a high set of a Sea from the Northward in his passage from <HI>Jap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> to <HI>Callyfornia,</HI> which he sayth, continued howsoever the windes blew, this doth shew the Sea to be open to the N. for the like may be observed upon our N. coast about <HI>Whitby</HI> where the highest set of the Sea commeth from the N, N, W. although that poynt bloweth oblicke to the coast, yet there is more Sea therwith then the N. E. wind bringeth, that blowes opposite; the reason is, that the land to the N, N, W. is the furthest re∣mote, all open towards the Pole where these windes East∣wards off N. doe blow, but from <HI>Greeneland</HI> and the N. Cape at furthest, whose greatest distance being not above 370 leagues must want space to raise his swelling motion, but contrary at the entrance into our Channell from W. you shall have a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Betweene <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> cōtinuall set into <HI>Sleeve,</HI> which showes the distances of land to be far to the W. and S. wards, and the like must be granted to this set of <HI>Francis Gauls,</HI> and also by that current that set <HI>la Tore</HI> to <HI>Tidore,</HI> it must come out of a wide Sea from the N, E.</P>
<P>And for knowing when thou art through, be assured thou shalt have as great a Sea from the <HI>del Zur</HI> as from the W. into our Sleeve, and the strength of tide along the coast will leave thee, then thou shalt not feare to direct thy course to <HI>Tartaria Cataia,</HI> or <HI>Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</HI></P>
<P>It may also be said that the Articke Circle is farre N. and that it will be frost, Icy and cold, and that there is but two moneths in the yeare to make this triall, for in the rest it will not be nauigable.</P>
<P>I answere, that the Articke circle is not so farre N. as the Cape of <HI>Finmarke</HI> neere in 73 d. where there is few or no Ice at any time, and thereby it is Navigable at all times, but that there is no trading in winter; besides the Sunne having great declination South, it is all night. But what is this to the Sea that is cleare of Ice, the like may this be for any yet knowne, for after I went from <HI>Swannes Nest,</HI> I see no yce to the N. nor doe I thinke there was any to the West, for the winde

blowing from the ayre was as warme as in <HI>England</HI> in the latter end of <HI>August,</HI> and the land had no snow thereon, al∣though it be very high land, and surely is inhabited, for else how could there have beene so many corps inwalled at Sir <HI>Thomas Roes Welcome,</HI> yet passing from hence S. ward into the bay it was colder, and yet warme enough.</P>
<P>And for those Ice which are ingendred in this shallow sandy Bay is but as in other places in <HI>Europe</HI> nere the same Latit. for those that have gone timely into the <HI>Balticke</HI> Sea hath found yce comming out of the Sound, and it is no marvaile to see the same froze over, which in those parts is as usuall as to have a noose, to have the shipping froze all the whole winter therein, and for waggons to goe in winter where Ships <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aile in Sommer for many miles; for it is well knowne that those Sandy Easterne low countreys, as <HI>Sprutia, Denmarke, Frisland,</HI> and the <HI>Neather lands,</HI> are in winter subiected to violent frost, then why should not wee allow this low sandy countrey and Bay the like, being about the same parallell, and a Bay as the Balticke is also from thence, which Latit. where it free∣zeth so hard, is from 52 to 57d. but elevate the Pole to 73 d. there at that time of winter in the same continent, there is no yce but that you may saile Sea free into the coast of <HI>Russia,</HI> why shuld then this our Westerne passage be denyed of as good an opinion but that it may be Sea free as well as theirs to saile in∣to the <HI>Mare del Zur</HI> to <HI>Cathaia,</HI> being doubtlesse to the South∣ward of that parallell; these a places of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> thus answering one another both in quality and clime.</P>
<P>Goe to <HI>Iseland</HI> as the Fishers doe now in <HI>March</HI> the North part lying in the Articke circle, and yet those Fishermen are not so troubled with Ice but that they can saile about it, and for the yce they finde there they conceive to be ingendred in the Bayes, Rivers, and Inlets of <HI>Groneland,</HI> and not about the Iland nor in the Sea: It now appeares as I said before that this country doth but comply with those countries Eastward, and the like may be expected by them that is found by the other, nor can this channell be narrow, that in 6 poynts of the com∣passe being but 4 howres ½. of time, to wit, from Sir <HI>Thomas Roes</HI> Iland to Port <HI>Nelson,</HI> doth send a flood and ebbe it backe againe along the coast for 150 leag. knowne in so short time and this to accord with the Moone.</P>

<P>ADmit I come from <HI>Hambrough</HI> or the Easterne Sea to ex∣pediate a Voyage through a great Ocean in a Country I have heard to lye far to the W. directing my course W. ward I met with land sooner then I did expect in coasting this land W. wards, I find an entrance which I follow for by my account I am but newly come to Sea and must be farre short of my intent, but following this entrance I finde there is eb∣bing and flowing which I pursue and finde it to be a River, which conceive to be the river of <HI>Thames,</HI> I goe therein with the tide without debarre or hinderance, yet finding the fur∣ther up that I do proceede the tide heightneth lesse water and runeth lesse time, so as knowing I goe from the East, W. ward as I desire, yet I doe not know what will become of this haz∣zard, but not knowing how to mend my selfe I must now play the game this way, at length I come to the head of this river, which conceive to be at <HI>Kingston,</HI> there I finde this tide which I followed out of the Easterne Sea, to fall into a spacious and large <HI>Mare</HI> or <HI>Ponte</HI> which <HI>Mare</HI> I enter. Now it must be conceived, that all the Country betweene <HI>Kingston</HI> and <HI>Severn</HI> neere <HI>Bristow</HI> as part of <HI>Surry</HI> part of <HI>Hampshire, Wiltshire, Glostershire, Oxford, Buckingham</HI> and part of <HI>Middlesex.</HI></P>
<P>To be ingulfed and turned into an inland Sea round about, being entred in this <HI>Ponte</HI> I begin to circuit about by the S, S, W. and comes to W. side where I finde an Inlet to wit the ri∣ver<NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>Gloster∣shire.</HI></NOTE> at <HI>Barkly</HI> comming from the W. Sea out of <HI>Severne</HI> eb∣bing and flowing into the <HI>Mare</HI> as that did on the E. side by which I entred, now I intend to venter into this ebbing and flowing of waters from the W. and thus persisting against the tyde by observation, as yesterday it flowed a W. Moone, this day it flowed a W. by N. Moone keeping this constant fluxe and refluxe from the W. Eastward so as sayling I shorten the tyde and is come in short distance, to the place where it flow∣ed S. W. the same tide I tooke at my entring this river or in∣set to flow W. I may now assure my selfe that those tyde streames are supported by waters from an Ocean which by pursuite I find to be the <HI>Atlanticke,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="133"/>It is to be observed in discoveries, as is found in other pla∣ces by experience, that in sayling against the flood-tide wee shorten the time of flowing, and in sayling therewith wee lengthen the same.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>This comparison standeth thus.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HAmbrough</HI> is <HI>England,</HI> from whence we saile to <HI>Fretum Hudson,</HI> which here is conceived to be the <HI>Thames,</HI> whose head as <HI>Kingston,</HI> is <HI>Cary Swans Nest,</HI> the Country, Pont or Mar, so ingulfed is <HI>Hudsons</HI> or <HI>Buttons</HI> Bay, the W. Tide com∣ming out of the Ocean at <HI>Severne</HI> is that new Tide I found at Sir <HI>Thomas Roes</HI> Ile, which pursued will bring me into the <HI>Mare del Zur.</HI></P>
<P>Let it not now be said, that there is no passage by the N, W into <HI>India,</HI> for that the best <HI>Cosmographers,</HI> those learned in the Mathematickes and all Arts, have in former time consented that <HI>America</HI> is an Iland and separated from any other conti∣nent, by which great <HI>Princes</HI> have been perswaded to adven∣ture and countenance with great Summes, (nor were their hopes mistaken, although as yet God hath not appoynted the time) as also the Nobility, Gentry, &amp; Merchants, when in the Voyage of Sir <HI>Thomas Button,</HI> were about 160 adventurers.</P>
<P>My comfort is, that the quantity of Whales and Sea Mors that place affordeth (although it may be thought that I did not see the 100 part) will (when Whale oyle comes into request) drive the Merchant to send the Marriner to visite the Ile of <HI>Brooke Cobham</HI> for the Whale, &amp; with their shallops range N, wards to search for Vnicorne horne, Mors teeth, and Whale∣finne, to come where Sir <HI>Tho: Roe</HI> will bid them <HI>Welcome,</HI> and by these inticements they will be perswaded to inquire after this tide, and at length bring home the good newes (which I expect) of this so long sought for.</P>
<P>For my part, I have now washt the Black-moore these five yeares, having yet received neither Sallery, wages or reward;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laboured in vaine.</NOTE> except what som few Gentlemen hath, I know not whether in curtesie or charity bestowed upon me having to fore had my meanes taken from me in the time of warres, betwixt <HI>France, Spaine</HI> and us, so as I am utterly unable to prosecute the same though I wish well thereto, knowing it is now to be done at very small charge.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="133"/>And this is more for their great comfort, that it hath plea∣sed almighty God of his great mercy, alwayes so to preserve those imployed this way to search in this discovery, that no ship ever perished, but howsoever they suffered, the account was brought home, and wee made acquainted with their actions; all which, wee must acknowledge to be the provi∣dence of Almighty God, who hath thus preserved those seeds we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owne and will doe still untill the time come which he hath appoynted, to send some happy man to plucke the fruit.

<P>The fifth of the knowne (and supposed passages) to that rich <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies,</HI> is by the Pole it selfe, yet never attempted; the gainest and most hopefull of those three, yet unknowne, and the shortest of them all as from our N. parts of <HI>Scotlands</HI> Iles, from the latit. of 60 d. to the Pole it selfe, is but 600 leag. of which it hath beene sayled to the 82 ½ d. by Captaine <HI>Tho∣mas Marmaduke</HI> of <HI>Hull,</HI> his furthest visible marke to the N. From thence was certaine Ilands he named <HI>Sheffields Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ades,</HI> in duty to his most noble favourer in his Northerne designes, was <HI>Edmond</HI> Lord <HI>Sheffield,</HI> now Earle of <HI>Mulgrave,</HI> and at that time Lord President of the North, by whose great assist∣ance, charge, and countenance, with the Merchants of the same Corporation, he was still set forth.</P>
<P>By which meanes in his discoveries N. ward towards the Pole, it was his good fortune to enter into a harbour in <HI>Green∣land,</HI> where he found one <HI>Jonas Poole,</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Woodcocke</HI> with others in a ship of <HI>London</HI> distressed, for that a fall of an Ice had sunke their Ship. Which subjects, with their oyles, Whale▪finnes, and Morsteeth, who must have miserably pe∣rished there if he had not brought them home, to this noble Lords perpetuall honour and the future incouragement of that trade, now the most rich and safest that wee have. And this is the best by prescription or any other claime the City of <HI>Yorke</HI> and the Corporation of <HI>Kingston</HI> vpon <HI>Hull</HI> can pleade for the continuance of their Trade thither; I make no doubt, but that they doe acknowledge his Lordship for the same with all thankfulnesse. This <HI>Greeneland</HI> was first seene by Mr. <HI>Hudson,</HI> who was countenanced by Sir <HI>Iohn Wolstenholme,</HI> in his N E. coursaries.</P>
<P><PB REF="134"/>There may be something objected against this passage. w<SUP>ch</SUP> may with ease be answered; and this Treatise better supplied, but this I leave to Capt. <HI>Goodlade,</HI> whose great experience this way, and to the E. ward thereof, is the best able to supply or confute, if he be pleased so to shew himselfe.</P>
<P>From the Pole to the knowne Coast of <HI>China</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> latit. 50 d. is but 800 leag. more, and yet the most Cosmographers have extended the land of <HI>Tartaria</HI> and <HI>Scythia</HI> N. ward, to the 60. 70. and 80 Parralell, Septentrionall latitude, and on the <HI>America</HI> side, is discovered to the 50d. So that the greatest distance is but 1400 leag. nearer by one third part then any other of the S. My pen and selfe now is growne weary, and hoping some other brave Spirit will enter the Lists, and at∣tempt the Enterprize, I rest.</P>
