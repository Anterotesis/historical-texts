<HEAD>THE Second Advice TO A PAINTER, FOR Drawing the History of our <HI>NAVALL</HI> Business; <HI>In Answer to</HI> Mr. Waller.</HEAD>
<L>NAy <HI>Painter,</HI> if thou dar'st design that Fight,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Waller</HI> only Courage had to Write;</L>
<L>If thy bold hand, can without shaking Draw,</L>
<L>What even the <HI>Actors</HI> trembled when they saw;</L>
<L>Enough to make thy Colours change like <HI>their's,</HI></L>
<L>And all thy Pencills bristle, like <HI>their Haires.</HI></L>
<L>First in fit distance of the prospect Vaine,</L>
<L>Paint <HI>Allen</HI> Tilting at the Coast of <HI>Spaine</HI>;</L>
<L>Heroick Act, and never heard till now,</L>
<L>Steming of <HI>Her'cles</HI> Pillers with his Prow,</L>
<L>And how two Ships he left, the Hills to waft,</L>
<L>And with new Sea-marks, <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Calice</HI> graft.</L>
<L>Next let the flaming <HI>London</HI> come in view.</L>
<L>Like <HI>Nero's Rome,</HI> burnt to Rebuild it new:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>What lesser Sacrifice then this was meet,</L>
<L>To offer for the fafty of the Fleet?</L>
<L>Blow one Ship up, another thence doth grow;</L>
<L>See what free Cities; and wise Courts can do.</L>
<L>So some old Merchant to ensure his Name,</L>
<L>Marries a fresh, and Courtiers share the Dame:</L>
<L>So what soe're is broke, the Servants pay't,</L>
<L>And Glasses are more durable then Plate.</L>
<L>No <HI>Mayor</HI> till now, so rich a <HI>Pageant</HI> fain'd;</L>
<L>Nor one <HI>Barge</HI> all the <HI>Companies</HI> contain'd.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Painter</HI> draw <HI>Coerulean Coventry,</HI></L>
<L>Keeper, or rather Chancelor of the Sea;</L>
<L>Of whom the Captain buys his leave to dye,</L>
<L>And Barters it for Wounds, or Infamy:</L>
<L>And more exactly to express his hue,</L>
<L>Use nothing but <HI>ultra marinish</HI> blue;</L>
<L>To pay his Fees the <HI>Silver Trumpet</HI> spend,</L>
<L>And <HI>Boatswains</HI> whistles; For his Place depends;</L>
<L><HI>Pilots</HI> in vain repeat the Compass o're,</L>
<L>Untill of him, they learn that one Point more;</L>
<L>The constant Magnet to the Pole doth hold,</L>
<L>Steel to the Magnet, <HI>Coventry</HI> to Gold:</L>
<L><HI>Muscovy</HI> sells us Hemp, and Pitch and Tar?</L>
<L>Iron and Copper <HI>Sweden; Munster</HI> War;</L>
<L><HI>Ashley</HI> Prizes, <HI>Warwick</HI> Customs, <HI>Cartret</HI> Pay?</L>
<L>But <HI>Coventry</HI> doth sell his Fleet away.</L>
<L>Now let our Navy stretch its Canvas wings,</L>
<L>Swoln like his purse, with tackling like its strings,</L>
<L>By slow degrees of the encreasing Gale,</L>
<L>First under Sale, and after under Sail:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="3"/>Then in kind visit unto <HI>Opdams</HI> Gout,</L>
<L>Hedge the <HI>Dutch</HI> in, only to let them out:</L>
<L>So <HI>Huntsmen</HI> fair, unto the <HI>Hares</HI> give law,</L>
<L>First find them, and then civilly withdraw,</L>
<L>That the blind <HI>Archer,</HI> when they take the Seas,</L>
<L>The <HI>Hamborough</HI> Convey may betray at ease.</L>
<L>So that the Fish may more securely bite,</L>
<L>The Fisher baits the River over night.</L>
<L>But <HI>Painter</HI> now prepare t'enrich thy Piece,</L>
<L>Pencills of <HI>Ermins,</HI> Oyl of <HI>Ambergreece</HI>:</L>
<L>See where the <HI>Dutches</HI> with triumphant tayl</L>
<L>Of numerous Coaches. <HI>Harwich</HI> doth assayl;</L>
<L>So the <HI>Land-Crabs,</HI> at Natures kindly call</L>
<L>Down to engender, at the Sea do crawl;</L>
<L>See then the <HI>Admiral</HI> with Navy whole,</L>
<L>To <HI>Harwich</HI> through the Ocean <HI>Caraloe</HI>:</L>
<L>So <HI>Swallows</HI> buried in the Sea, at Spring,</L>
<L>Return to Land, with Summer in their wing.</L>
<L>One thrifty Ferry-boat of Mother-Pearl</L>
<L>Suffic'd of old, the <HI>Citherian Girl</HI>:</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Navies</HI> are but propperties, when here</L>
<L>A small Sea-mask, built to court you Dear.</L>
<L>Three <HI>Goddesses</HI> in one. <HI>Pallas</HI> for Art,</L>
<L><HI>Venus</HI> for Sport, and <HI>Juno</HI> in your heart.</L>
<L>Oh <HI>Dutches</HI>! if thy Nuptial Pomp were mean,</L>
<L>It's paid with intrest, in this Naval Scean:</L>
<L>Never did <HI>Roman Mark</HI> within the <HI>Nyle,</HI></L>
<L>So feast the fair <HI>Egyptian Crocodile</HI>;</L>
<L>Nor the <HI>Venetian</HI> Duke with such a State,</L>
<L>The <HI>Adriatique</HI> Marry at that Rate.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>Now <HI>Painter</HI> spare thy weaker Art, forbear</L>
<L>To draw her parting passions, and each tear,</L>
<L>For love alass, hath but a short delight,</L>
<L>The Winds, the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>King,</HI> all calls to fight;</L>
<L><HI>She</HI> therefore the <HI>Dukes</HI> person recommends</L>
<L>To <HI>Brunker, Pen</HI> and <HI>Coventry,</HI> as friends;</L>
<L><HI>Pen,</HI> much more to <HI>Brunker,</HI> most to <HI>Coventry.</HI></L>
<L>For they (she knew) were more 'fraid then <HI>bee.</HI></L>
<L>Of flying Fishes, one had fav'd the Finn,</L>
<L>And hop'd with that, he through the Aire might spin:</L>
<L>The other thought he might avoid his Knell,</L>
<L>In the Invention of the Diving Bell:</L>
<L>The third had tri'd it, and afirm'd, a Cable</L>
<L>Coil'd round about men, was Impenetrable:</L>
<L>But these the <HI>Duke</HI> rejected; only chose</L>
<L>To keep far off, and others Interpose.</L>
<L><HI>Rupert</HI> that knew not fear, but health did want,</L>
<L>Kept state suspended in his Chair <HI>volant,</HI></L>
<L>All save his head shut in the wooden Case,</L>
<L>He shew'd but like a broken weather-Glasse;</L>
<L>But arm'd in a whole Lyon <HI>Cap-a-chin,</HI></L>
<L>Did represent a <HI>Hercules</HI> within;</L>
<L>Dear, shall the <HI>Dutch</HI> his twinging Anguish know,</L>
<L>And feel what Valour (whet with pain) can do:</L>
<L>Curst in the mean time be that traitrous <HI>Iael,</HI></L>
<L>That through his Princely temples drove the nail.</L>
<L><HI>Rupert</HI> resolv'd to fight it like a Lyon,</L>
<L>But <HI>Sandwich</HI> hop'd to fight it like <HI>Aryon</HI>:</L>
<L>He to prolong his life in the dispute,</L>
<L>(And Charm the <HI>Holland Pyrats</HI>) tun'd his Lute,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="4"/>Till some juditious Dolphin might approach,</L>
<L>And land him safe and sound as any Roach;</L>
<L>Hence by the <HI>Gazetteir</HI> he was mistooke,</L>
<L>As unconcern'd, as if at <HI>Hinchinbrooke.</HI></L>
<L>Now <HI>Painter</HI> reassume thy Pencills care,</L>
<L>It has but Skirmisht yet, Now Fight prepare</L>
<L>And Battle draw, more terrible to show,</L>
<L>Then the last judgement was of <HI>Angelo</HI>:</L>
<L>First let our Navy scour through silver froth,</L>
<L>The Oceans burthen, and the Kingdomes both;</L>
<L>Whose every bulk doth represent it's birth</L>
<L>From <HI>Hide,</HI> and <HI>Paston,</HI> burthens of the earth!</L>
<L><HI>Hide,</HI> whose transcendent Paunch so swells of late.</L>
<L>That he the Rupture seems of Law and State.</L>
<L><HI>Paston,</HI> whose belly devours more Millions</L>
<L>Then <HI>Indian</HI> Carracks, and contains more Tuns.</L>
<L>Let sholes of Porposes on every side</L>
<L>Wonder in swimming, by the Oakes out-vide</L>
<L>And the Sea-fowls (at gaze) behold a thing</L>
<L>So vast, more strong and swift then they of wing:</L>
<L>Both which presaging gorge, yet keep in sight,</L>
<L>And follow for the Reliques of the Fight.</L>
<L>Then let the <HI>Dutch</HI> with well disembling fear,</L>
<L>Or bold dispair, more then we wish, draw near;</L>
<L>At which our Gallants, to the Sea but tender,</L>
<L>And more to fight, Their squezy stomacks render,</L>
<L>With breasts so panting, that at every stroake</L>
<L>You might have felt their hearts beat through the Oke;</L>
<L>Whilst one concern'd most in the interval</L>
<L>Of straining Choller, thus did cast his Gall;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5"/><HI>Noah</HI> be damb'd, and all his Race accurst,</L>
<L>Who in Sea-brine did pickle Timber first;</L>
<L>Who, though be planted Vines, he Pines cut down</L>
<L>He taught us how to drink, and how to drown:</L>
<L>He first built Ships, and in the Woodden-Wall,</L>
<L>Saving but Eight, e're since endangers All.</L>
<L>And thou <HI>Dutch</HI> Negromantick Frier, Damn'd,</L>
<L>And in thine own first Morter-piece be ram'd,</L>
<L>Who first inventedst Cannon in thy Cell,</L>
<L><HI>Nitre</HI> from Earth, and <HI>Brimstone</HI> fetcht from Hell.</L>
<L>But Damn'd, and treble Damn'd be <HI>Clarendine,</HI></L>
<L>(Our Seventh <HI>Edward</HI>) with his House and Line;</L>
<L>Who, to devert the danger of the <HI>War</HI></L>
<L>With <HI>Bristol,</HI> hounds us on the <HI>Hallander</HI>:</L>
<L>F<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls coated Gown-men, sells to fight with <HI>Hans</HI></L>
<L><HI>Dunkirk,</HI> Dismantles <HI>Scotland,</HI> quarrels <HI>France</HI>;</L>
<L>And hopes he now hath business shap'd, &amp; power</L>
<L>T'out <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his life, or ours, and scape the <HI>Tower,</HI></L>
<L>And that he yet may see, e're he went down,</L>
<L>His dear <HI>Clarinda</HI> circled in a Crown.</L>
<L>By this time both the Fleets in reach, dispute,</L>
<L>And each the other mortally Salute:</L>
<L>Draw pensive <HI>Neptune</HI> biting of his thumbs,</L>
<L>To think himself a Slave, who e're o're comes;</L>
<L>And frighted <HI>Nymphs</HI> retreating to the Rocks,</L>
<L>Beating their blue breasts, tearing their green locks</L>
<L>Paint <HI>Ecchoes</HI> slain, only the alternate sound</L>
<L>From the repeating Cannon doth rebound;</L>
<L><HI>Opdam</HI> sails up, mounted on his Naval throne,</L>
<L>Assuming Courage greater then his own:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="5"/>Makes to the <HI>Duke,</HI> and threatens him from far,</L>
<L>To nail himself to's Board like a <HI>Petar</HI>:</L>
<L>But in this vain attempt, takes fire too soon,</L>
<L>And flies up in his Ship to catch the Moon:</L>
<L><HI>Mounsiers,</HI> like Rockets, mount aloft and crack</L>
<L>In thousand sparks, then prancingly fall back;</L>
<L>Yet e're this hapned, Destiny allow'd</L>
<L>Him his Revenge, to make his Death more proud</L>
<L>A fatal Bullet from his side did range</L>
<L>And battered <HI>Lawson,</HI> Ah! too dear exchange:</L>
<L>He led our Fleet (that day) too short a space;</L>
<L>But lost his Knee, died since in honours Race:</L>
<L><HI>Lawson,</HI> whose Valour beyound Fate doth go,</L>
<L>Doth still fight <HI>Opdam</HI> in the shades helow.</L>
<L>The <HI>Duke</HI> himself, though <HI>Pen</HI> did not forget,</L>
<L>Yet was not out of Dangers random set.</L>
<L><HI>Falmouth</HI> was there, I know not what to act,</L>
<L>Unless it was to grow Duke by Contract;</L>
<L>An un-taught Bullet in its wanton scope,</L>
<L>Quashes him all to pieces and his hope:</L>
<L>Such as his Rise, such was his Fall, unprais'd,</L>
<L>A chance-shot sooner took, then chance him rais'd</L>
<L>His shatter'd head the fearless <HI>Duke</HI> disdains,</L>
<L>Which gave the last, first proof that he had brains.</L>
<L><HI>Berkley</HI> had heard it soon, and thought not good</L>
<L>To venter more of Royal <HI>Hardings</HI> blood;</L>
<L>To be immortal, he was not of Age,</L>
<L>And did even now the <HI>Indian</HI> prize presage;</L>
<L>But judg'd it safe and decent (cost what cost)</L>
<L>To loose the Day, since his drar Brother's lost,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="6"/>With his whole Squadron straight away he bore,</L>
<L>And like good Boy, promis'd to fight no more.</L>
<L>The <HI>Dutch Aurania</HI> careless at Us fail'd,</L>
<L>And promised to do, what <HI>Opdam</HI> fail'd;</L>
<L><HI>Smith</HI> (to the <HI>Duke</HI>) doth intercept her way;</L>
<L>And cleaves there, closer then the <HI>Re-mo-ra</HI>:</L>
<L>The Captain wonder'd, and withall disdain'd,</L>
<L>So strongly, by a thing so small, to be detain'd;</L>
<L>And in a raging bravery to him runs,</L>
<L>They stab'd their Ships with one anothers Guns;</L>
<L>They fight so neer, it seems to be on ground,</L>
<L>And even Bullets meeting Bullets wound;</L>
<L>The noise, the smoak, the sweat, the fire, the blood,</L>
<L>Is not to be exprest, nor understood;</L>
<L>Each Captain from the quarter Deck Commands,</L>
<L>They wave their bright Swords glittering in their hands;</L>
<L>All luxury of war, all Man can do</L>
<L>In a Sea-fight, did pass between them two:</L>
<L>But one must conquer, who so e're does Fight;</L>
<L><HI>Smith</HI> took the <HI>Gyant,</HI> and is since made Knight.</L>
<L><HI>Marlborow,</HI> who knew, &amp; dar'd no more then All,</L>
<L>Falls undistinguish'd by an Iron-Ball;</L>
<L>Dear <HI>Lord,</HI> but born under a Star ungrate,</L>
<L>No soul so clear, nor none more gloomy fate:</L>
<L>Who would set up Wars trade, that means to thrive,</L>
<L>Death picks the Valliant out, Cowards survive:</L>
<L>What the brave merrit, the Impudent do vaunt,</L>
<L>And none's rewarded, but the Sicophant:</L>
<L>Hence all his life-time, he 'gainst Fortune fenc'd,</L>
<L>Or not well known, or not well recompenc'd;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="6"/>But envy, not this praise to's Memory,</L>
<L>None more prepar'd, and none less fit to dye:</L>
<L><HI>Rupert</HI> did others, and himself excell:</L>
<L><HI>Holmes, Tiddiman, Minns</HI>; bravely <HI>Sanson</HI> fell.</L>
<L>What Others did, let none omitted, blame;</L>
<L>I shall record, who e're brings in his name;</L>
<L>But unless after stories disagree,</L>
<L>Nine only came to fight, the rest to see.</L>
<L>Now all conspire unto the <HI>Dutchmens</HI> loss,</L>
<L>The wind, the fire, Wee, They themselves do cross.</L>
<L>When a sweet sleep the <HI>Duke</HI> began to drown,</L>
<L>And with soft Diadems his Temples crown;</L>
<L>But first he orders all besides himself to watch,</L>
<L>That they the Foe (whilst he a Nap) shu'd catch:</L>
<L>But <HI>Brunker</HI> by a secreter instinct</L>
<L>Slept not, nor needs hee, he all day had wink'd;</L>
<L>The <HI>Duke</HI> in Bed; he then first draws his Steel,</L>
<L>Whose Vertue makes the misled Compass reel:</L>
<L>So er'e he wakes, both Fleets are inocent,</L>
<L>And <HI>Brunker</HI> Member is of Parliament.</L>
<L>And now dear <HI>Painter,</HI> after pains like those,</L>
<L>'Twere time that thou and I too should repose:</L>
<L>But all our Navy scape so sound of Limb,</L>
<L>That a small space serv'd to Refresh its Trim:</L>
<L>And a tame Fleet of theirs do Convoy want,</L>
<L>Laden with both the <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>Levant</HI>:</L>
<L>Paint but this one Scene more, the worlds our own</L>
<L>The Halcion <HI>Sandwich</HI> doth Command alone;</L>
<L>To <HI>Bergen</HI> now with better Maw we hast,</L>
<L>And the sweet spoiles in hope already taste:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="7"/>Though <HI>Clifford</HI> in the Caracter appears,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Super Cargo</HI> to our Fleet, and Theirs.</L>
<L>Wearing a <HI>Signet</HI> ready to clap on,</L>
<L>And ceaze on all for's Master <HI>Arlington.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ruiter,</HI> whose little Sqadron skimes the Seas,</L>
<L>And wasteth our remotest <HI>Collonies,</HI></L>
<L>With Ships all soul, return upon our way.</L>
<L><HI>Sandwich</HI> would not disperse, nor yet delay;</L>
<L>And therefore like Commander Grave and Wife,</L>
<L>To escape his sight and fight, shuts both his eyes:</L>
<L>And for more state and sureness, Curtins drew,</L>
<L>He the left eye closes, the right <HI>Mountegue.</HI></L>
<L>And even <HI>Clifford</HI> proffer'd in his Zeal,</L>
<L>To make all sure, to apply to both his Seal.</L>
<L><HI>Vlisses</HI> so till he the <HI>Cyrens</HI> past,</L>
<L>Would by his Mates be Pinnioned to the Mast.</L>
<L>Now can our Navy view the wish'd for Port,</L>
<L>But there (to see the fortune) was a Fort.</L>
<L><HI>Sandwich</HI> would not be beaten, nor yet beat,</L>
<L>Fools only fight, the Prudent use to Treat.</L>
<L>His Conzen <HI>Mountegue</HI> by Court disaster,</L>
<L>Dwingled into a wooden Horses Master.</L>
<L>To speak of Peace. seeem'd unto all most proper,</L>
<L>Had <HI>Talbot</HI> there treated of nought but Copper:</L>
<L>What are Forts when void of Ammunition,</L>
<L>With friend or foe? what would we more conditi∣on</L>
<L>Yet we three days (till the <HI>'Dutch</HI> furnish'd all,</L>
<L>Men, Money, Cannon, Powder) treat with Wall.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Tiddy</HI> finding that the <HI>Dane</HI> would not,</L>
<L>Sends in six Captains bravely to be shot:</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="7"/>And <HI>Mountague,</HI> though drest like any Bride,</L>
<L>Though Aboard him too, was reacht and died.</L>
<L>Sad was this chance, and yet a deeper care,</L>
<L>Wrinckled our <HI>Membrains</HI> under forehead fair:</L>
<L>The <HI>Dutch Armado</HI> yet had impudence,</L>
<L>To put to Sea, to waft their Merchants thence;</L>
<L>For as if all their Ships of Walnuts were,</L>
<L>The more we beat them, still the more they bear.</L>

<L>Well <HI>George,</HI> in spite of them thou safe dost ride,</L>
<L>Lessen'd in nought, I hope, but thy backside;</L>
<L>For as to Reputation, this Retreat</L>
<L>Of thine exceeds their Victory so great,</L>
<L>Nor shalt thou stir from thence by my consent,</L>
<L>Till thou hast made the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and them repent:</L>
<L>'Tis true, I want, so long the Nuptial gift,</L>
<L>But (as I oft have done) I'le make a shift;</L>

<L>Fall to thy work <HI>George</HI> there, as I do here,</L>
<L>Cherish the Valiant, and the Coward Cashier,</L>
<L>See that the men have Pay, and Beef, and Beer,</L>
<L>Find out the Cheats of the four Millioneer;</L>
<L>Out of the very Beer they steal the Malt,</L>
<L>Powder from Powder, and from Beef the Salt;</L>

<L>All their Sea-markets, and their Cable coyl;</L>
<L>Tell the King all, who do him Countermine,</L>
<L>Trust not, till done, him with thy own design;</L>
<L>Look that good Chaplains on each Ship do waite,</L>

<L>As Prize, they rob the very Hospital;</L>

<L>We fight, if all be taken which is tane,</L>
<L>Along our Coasts, the <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> like a flight</L>
<L>Oh feeding Ducks, Morning and Evening light.</L>
<L>How our Land-Hectors tremble, void of fence,</L>
<L>As if they came straight to transport them hence,</L>
<L>Some Ship are stoln, the Kingdom all array'd</L>

<L>What's that I see; ha! 'tis my <HI>George</HI> agen</L>
<L>It seems in seven weeks they've rigg'd him then,</L>
<L>That curious Heaven with lightning him surrounds</L>
<L>To view him, and his Name in Thunder sounds,</L>
<L>But with the same shaft gores his Navy neer,</L>
<L>So e're we hunt, the Keeper shoots the Deer.</L>
<L>Stay Heaven a while, and thou shalt see him sayl,</L>
<L>And how <HI>George</HI> too can Lighten, Thunder, Hail,</L>
<L>Happy the time that I thee wedded <HI>George,</HI></L>
<L>The Sword of <HI>England,</HI> and of <HI>Holland</HI> scourge.</L>

<L>I'le teach thee to shoot <HI>Sizers,</HI> I'le repair,</L>
<L>Each Rope thou loosest <HI>George,</HI> out of this Hair,</L>
<L>E're thou shalt lack a <HI>Sail,</HI> and lye a drift,</L>
<L>('Tis strong, and course enough) I'le cut this <HI>Shift,</HI></L>
<L>Bring home the Old ones, I again will few,</L>

<L>They flie! they flie! their Fleet does now divide,</L>
<L>But they discard their Trump, our Trump is <HI>Hide.</HI></L>
<L>Where are you now <HI>de Ruiter</HI> with your Bears?</L>
<L>See how your Merchants burn about your ears.</L>
<L>Fire out the wasps, <HI>George,</HI> from their hollow trees,</L>
<L>Cram'd with the Honey of our <HI>English</HI> Bees.</L>
<L>Ay now they're paid for <HI>Guiny,</HI> e're they steer</L>
<L>To the hot Coast, they find it hotter here.</L>
<L>Turn all your Ships to Stoves ere you set forth,</L>
<L>To warm your Traffique in the frozen <HI>North.</HI></L>
<L>Ah! <HI>Sandwich</HI> had thy Conduct been the same,</L>
<L><HI>Bergen</HI> had seen a less, but richer Flame;</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Ruiter</HI> liv'd new Battel to repeat,</L>

<L>Scarce has <HI>George</HI> leasure after all this pain,</L>
<L>To tye his Breeches, <HI>Ruiter's</HI> out again:</L>
<L>Thrice in one year? why sure the man is wood,</L>
<L>Beat him like Stock-fish, or he'l nere be good.</L>
<L>I see them both again, prepar'd to try,</L>
<L>They first shoot through each other with the Eye.</L>
<L>Then— but that ruling Providence that must</L>
<L>With humane projects play, as Wind with Dust,</L>
<L>Raised a Storm, (so Constables a Fray,</L>
<L>Knock down) and send them both well cuft away.</L>

<L>So Champions having shar'd the List, and Sun,</L>

<L>Woe's me! what see I next? alass the Fate</L>
<L>I see of <HI>England,</HI> and its utmost date;</L>
<L>These flames of theirs, at which we fondly smile,</L>

<L>War, Fire, and Plague, against us all conspire;</L>
<L>We the Fire, God the Plague, who rais'd the Fire?</L>
<L>See how men all like Ghosts, while <HI>London</HI> burns</L>
<L>Wander, and each o're his Ashes mourns.</L>
<L>Dear <HI>George</HI>! sad fate! vain mind! that did me please</L>
<L>To meet thine with far other flames then these.</L>
<L>Curst be that man that first began this War;</L>
<L>In an ill hour under a blazing Star:</L>
<L>For others sport, two Nations fight a Prize,</L>
<L>Between them both, Religion mounded dies.</L>
<L>So of first <HI>Troy</HI> the angry Gods unpaid,</L>
<L>Rac'd the foundations which themselves had laid.</L>
<L>Welcome, though late dear <HI>George,</HI> here hadst thou been</L>
