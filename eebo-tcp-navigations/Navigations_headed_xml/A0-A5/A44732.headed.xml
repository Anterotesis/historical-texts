<HEAD>To the Renowned City of London.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Right Honourable, Honourable,
and all others,
Who owe their first Birth or wellbeing
to so Noble a Metropolis.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a notable Character, which <HI>Cornelius Tacitus,</HI> (that famous
Register of Time, who had lived here many years) did give of <HI>London</HI>
about fifteen hundred years agoe, <HI>Londinum copiâ Negotiatorum,
&amp; Comeatu maximè celebre,</HI> London a most renowned Mart for multi∣tude
of Marchants, and Commerce. If She deserved such a Character in
those dayes, what would She merit now? who being compared to what she was
then, may be said, in point of magnitude, to be as a large Volume in Folio,
to a Book <HI>in Decimo Sexto:</HI> And, in point of <HI>Trade,</HI> as in an East Indy
<HI>Carack,</HI> to a Quinbourough <HI>Oyster ketch.</HI></P>
<P>I have read of some, who have bin enamor'd of <HI>Cities,</HI> as others use to be
of <HI>Mistresses:</HI> so <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperor, was struck with the love of <HI>Flo∣rence,</HI>
when among other expressions he said, <HI>That she was a fair Lady,
fit to be seen only on Holidayes;</HI> So a French Baron was so taken with
the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> (which is known to be none of the <HI>neatest)</HI> that he said,
<HI>Could he live ever in</HI> Paris, <HI>he would quit his right to</HI> Paradise. And
it is storied of <HI>Tamberlain,</HI> that having got <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the first Com∣plement
he put upon Her, was, <HI>that he had heard so much of Her rare
beauty, that He came from so far off to Court Her;</HI> but answer was
made, that it was the Custom of <HI>Thrace,</HI> to Court fair Ladies, not with <HI>Trum∣pets</HI>
and <HI>Drums,</HI> but with <HI>Dulcimers,</HI> and other melodious Instruments.</P>
<P>I may well affirm, that <HI>London</HI> is not inferior to any of these, as will
appear in a <HI>Parallel</HI> hereunto annexed: And having breath'd Air, and
slept in her bosom, now near upon forty years (except the times that I was a∣broad
upon forren Employments,) it is no wonder, if I be <HI>habitually</HI> in love
with Her; nor have I bin wanting to express it many times by dedicating
unto Her the great <HI>French</HI> Dictionary refin'd, and enrich'd with divers
Additionals; Then in giving Her some warnings by the sad destiny of <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI>
in an Epitome that goes of <HI>Josephus;</HI> I shewed my self also very
sensible of Her case at that time, when I addressd unto Her <HI>Englands
Teares,</HI> and <HI>Mercurius Acheronticus.</HI> nor is it long since, that I made
publick love to <HI>Venice,</HI> and Courted <HI>Naples</HI> also, and I came off with no ill
success; I hope to do the like here.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
I know others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave treated already of the same Subject, and given a lau∣dible
account of the City of <HI>London,</HI> but Gold may be often told over with∣out
fouling the fingers. I have read near upon a dozen several Survayes
of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> with other Cities, and I alwayes found new Observa∣tions;
But it is now above thirty foure years agoe, (which are near upon five
Ages in the Law) since any thing was written of <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>West∣minster</HI>
her collateral Sister; which tract of time, affords variety of accidents,
which the Reader shall find in this new Account: wherein as I have bin care∣ful
not to pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermit any thing thats <HI>Material,</HI> so my special Caution hath
bin not to thrust in any frivolous pedantick things, or <HI>Superfluities,</HI> where∣unto
my nature hath bin alwayes averse; Moreover, I promise the Reader,
that he shall meet with many other Observations here, which were never yet
drawn off the Presse, or exposed to publick light until now.</P>
<P>I will conclude my Epistle with this Question, If it was esteemed an honour
among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> to be born in <HI>Athens;</HI> If among the <HI>Italians,</HI> to be a
<HI>Roman;</HI> If among the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be a <HI>Toledano:</HI> why should it be lesse
honour for an <HI>Englishman</HI> to be born in <HI>London?</HI></P>
<P>My hearty prayers to Heaven are, for the incolumity, and welfare of this
Great City, for the aversion of all Iudgements, and that she may still flourish
with affluence of all Earthly felicity; by which prayer I subscribe my self,</P>

<HEAD>SOME
ADVERTISEMENTS
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>THey who make researches into <HI>Antiquity,</HI> may be said to passe
often through many <HI>dark Lobbies,</HI> and dusky places, before
they come to <HI>Aula lucis,</HI> the Great Hall of light; They must
repair to old <HI>Archives,</HI> and peruse many mouldred and moth-eaten
Records, and so bring light as it were out of darkness, to inform
the <HI>present</HI> World, what the <HI>former</HI> did, and make us see truth through
our <HI>Ancestors</HI> eyes. Now, though we commonly term <HI>Them</HI> that
went before us our <HI>Ancestors,</HI> yet if we have respect to the extent of
<HI>Time,</HI> and the <HI>Age</HI> of the World, <HI>we</HI> who live now, may be called the
more <HI>Ancient;</HI> For <HI>They</HI> lived, some of them in the <HI>Non-age,</HI> some in
the <HI>Youth,</HI> some in the <HI>Adolescence,</HI> some in the <HI>virility</HI> of the World,
And <HI>We</HI> who now crawl up and down the earth, may be said to live in
the declining and <HI>doting old decrepit Age:</HI> Therefore if relation be
had to true <HI>longaevity, We</HI> may be rather called the <HI>Older:</HI> Insomuch,
that a Child born to day, as he is part of the Universe, and the pro∣duct
of Time, may be said to be more ancient then <HI>Adam,</HI> which I con∣ceive
to be the meaning of that common saying among us, <HI>The youn∣ger
Brother is the ancienter Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, it is desired, that the <HI>discerning</HI> Reader be advertized,
that Historians and <HI>Antiquaries,</HI> may well be compared to <HI>Architects,</HI>
who in rearing up a Fabrick, although the <HI>Idaea,</HI> and design of the
work, with the site, the contrivement of rooms, the contignation of
parts and Symmetry, be wholly in themselves; yet in point of
<HI>Substance,</HI> they fetch their <HI>Materials</HI> from else where; so the <HI>Historian</HI>
and <HI>Antiquary,</HI> though the method, the style, and compilement be his,
yet he hath his matter from others, either from Manuscripts, or
printed Records, except these modern passages that are <HI>Synchronical</HI>
with himself. Furthermore, an <HI>Historian</HI> may be compared to one
walking in a Garden, and making a posie of Flowers, which he culs
and plucks from divers beds and banks; now, though the Flowers be
none of his, yet the choyce of them, and twisting them together, to
give the fuller fragnancy, and not to thrust in any unsavory vegetal, is
solely his own work.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and my Lord <HI>Harbert</HI>'s <HI>Henry</HI>
the eighth, though the composition, and digesting be theirs, whereby
they <HI>denominate</HI> the Books, yet, under favour, touching the main <HI>In∣gredients,</HI>
they took them from others, who had written the life of
<PB REF="5"/>
those Kings before: So, concerning this present <HI>Treatise,</HI> although the
trace, and form of the Structure be mine own; yet, I am so much the
Child of modesty, as to acknowledge to have fetch'd most of my
<HI>Materials</HI> from others, who preceded me in the same Subject; as from
Mr. <HI>Stow,</HI> and those industrious persons, who have made Additionals
unto him: yet, as I gave a hint before in my Epistle Dedicatory, there
be divers things inserted here, which are not found there, nor any
where else; besides those modern Occurrences which have happened
since, and are contemporary with myself.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y purpose is to give as exact an account, as my <HI>Enquiries</HI> can, of
the renowned City of <HI>London,</HI> with her <HI>Suburbs</HI> annexed; And,
to proceed herein the more regularly, the <HI>foundation</HI> of my
Discourse shall be layed with <HI>that</HI> of <HI>Hers,</HI> beginning with her
first Rise or Original; Then it shall grow up with Her, accor∣ding
to those Degrees of profection, that she is now arrived
unto.</P>
<P>From her <HI>Foundation</HI> we will bring you to her <HI>Walls,</HI> and so lead you in at her
<HI>Gates;</HI> whence you shall walk along her <HI>streets,</HI> and visit her <HI>Churches</HI> with o∣ther
ancient <HI>Religious</HI> Houses, and publique Edifices; Then we shall bring you
to refresh your self at her <HI>Conduits,</HI> and <HI>Aquaeducts,</HI> her <HI>brooks, bourns,</HI> and <HI>Wells;</HI>
Afterwards, we shall gently lead you along over her <HI>Bridges,</HI> and so bring you to
solace your self upon the rare, and renowned River of <HI>Thames,</HI> which we shall
derive from her very <HI>source,</HI> and accompany her Stream all along, till she comes
to pay tribute to the <HI>Ocean;</HI> Then we shall make a perambulation in her seve∣rall
<HI>Precincts, Divisions,</HI> and <HI>Wards.</HI> And because nothing displayes the prudence
of a City more, then her political way, and method of <HI>Government,</HI> we shall en∣deavour
to satisfie you in that point, and speak of her <HI>Magistracy,</HI> her <HI>Priviledges,</HI>
her well-moulded <HI>Corporations</HI> and <HI>Companies,</HI> whereby we shall take occasion to
revive the memory of those famous <HI>Patriots,</HI> and Worthies, which she hath
produc'd and bred, with their <HI>Munificence,</HI> their <HI>Merits,</HI> and publique <HI>Monu∣ments.</HI></P>
<P>We shall go on then to give the neerest conjecture we can make of her <HI>dimen∣sions,</HI>
in point of <HI>length</HI> and <HI>latitude,</HI> and of the number of <HI>humane souls,</HI> that u∣sually
dwell, and lodge within Her; Nor shall we conceal some <HI>Clowds</HI> that have
hung over her, and ill-favour'd <HI>clashings</HI> she hath had with her <HI>Soveraign</HI> Prin∣ces.</P>
<P>And lastly, There will be a short Discourse by way of <HI>parallel,</HI> betwixt the
City of <HI>London,</HI> and other the most populous great <HI>Marts</HI> of the World.</P>

to visit the <HI>gran Cairo;</HI> and then takes her leave of Her, as <HI>punctually</HI> the <HI>Autum∣nal
Equinox</HI> next following, having first impregnated the hot womb of <HI>Egypt,</HI>
with a wonderful <HI>prolificall</HI> vertue, for the generation of so many species of A∣nimalls,
and Vegetalls.</P>
<P>But to finde out the <HI>Original</HI> of the City of <HI>London,</HI> 'tis not so hard a matter;
yet, there are variety of Opinions hereof, which we will briefly examine;
<HI>Ptolomy, Tacitus,</HI> and <HI>Antonine,</HI> call her sometimes <HI>Londinium,</HI> and sometimes
<HI>Longidinium. Ammianus Marsellinus,</HI> calls her <HI>Lundinum,</HI> and sometimes
<HI>Augusta,</HI> which is, <HI>the stately and magnificent City.</HI> There are some who call Her
<HI>Troia nova,</HI> or <HI>Troynovant;</HI> which appellation, <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in that famous
long Letter he writ to Pope <HI>Boniface,</HI> about the <HI>Scots Nation,</HI> seemes to assert:
Others call her <HI>Caer Lud,</HI> other <HI>Dinas Belin;</HI> But that Opinion which quadrats
most with truth, is, that her first Founders, and Godfathers, were the ancient
Britains, (whom we now call Welsh) who by confession of all Antiquaries, both
domestick and sorraign, were the <HI>Aborigenes,</HI> and first Inhabitants of this
Countrey, being contemporary, and as it were <HI>concreated</HI> with the <HI>Iland</HI> her
self; There are three denominations, which are derived from the Britans, viz.
<HI>Llhogdin; Llhwndian,</HI> and <HI>Llhandian,</HI> which we shall endeavour to explane;
Touching the first, the <HI>Britans</HI> call a ship <HI>Llhong,</HI> and <HI>Dinan</HI> a Town. Insomuch,
that <HI>Llongdin</HI> is no other then <HI>Shipton,</HI> or <HI>a Town of Ships;</HI> And I have read of
many Cities, who derive their names from Ships, as <HI>Naupactum, Nauplia, Naua∣lia
Augusti, Nauctathmos;</HI> But none of these hath more right to assume the
Title of <HI>Shipton,</HI> or <HI>Llhongdin</HI> (according to the British) as the City of <HI>London</HI>
hath, in regard that she is situated, upon the gentle ascent, or flank of a Hill hard
by a dainty <HI>Navigable River,</HI> which swelling at certain set houres with the O∣cean
Tides, she is able by her deep, and safe Channel to entertain the greatest
bottoms and Ships, that can ride on Neptunes back, which makes Her so famous
a Mart, those Ships bringing in all the rich Commodities that the VVorld can
afford; whereunto alludes old <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Glocester,</HI> in the Rimes of those dayes,
which I thought worthy to insert here for the Antiquity of the Dialect.
<Q><L>In the Country of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> most plenty of <HI>Fish</HI> is;</L>
<L>And most chase of Beasts about <HI>Salsbury</HI> I wis,</L>
<L>And <HI>London Ships</HI> most, and <HI>Wine</HI> at <HI>Winchester,</HI></L>
<L><HI>At</HI> Hartford Sheep <HI>and</HI> Oxe, <HI>and</HI> fruit at Worcester,</L>
<L>Soap about <HI>Coventry,</HI> and <HI>Iron</HI> at <HI>Glocestor,</HI></L>
<L>Metal, Lead, and Tin in the Country of <HI>Exceter,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Enorwick</HI> of fairest wood, <HI>Lincoln</HI> of fairest men,</L>
<L><HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Huntingdon</HI> most plenty of deep venne,</L>
<L><HI>Ely</HI> of fairest place, of fairest sight <HI>Rochester.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Touching the second <HI>British</HI> appellation <HI>Llhwndian, Caesar,</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> do
mention, that the ancient <HI>Britans</HI> called those Woods or Groves, which they
had barrocadoed and fenc'd about with Trees cast down, and plash'd, to prevent
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
all inrodes and assaults, they call'd such a place I say <HI>Llhwn,</HI> which is equivalent
to a <HI>fenc'd Town,</HI> or dwelling, as the Poet sings of them.
<Q><L>—Their Houses were the Thicks,</L>
<L>And bushy queaches hollow Caves, and Hardles made of sticks.</L></Q></P>
<P>And 'tis more then probable, that in that place, where St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church now
stands, there was a <HI>Wood</HI> or Grove at first, in regard there was a <HI>Fane</HI> or <HI>Temple</HI>
erected there to the honour of <HI>Diana;</HI> for Historians observe, that whereas <HI>Ve∣nus,
Mars,</HI> and <HI>Vulcan</HI> were used to have their Temples in the <HI>Suburbs, Iu∣piter</HI>
and <HI>Apollo</HI> within the City, the Goddess <HI>Diana</HI> was used to have her
Temples set up in <HI>Woods,</HI> which might make the Britains denominate that place
<HI>Llhwndian,</HI> which is as much as <HI>Diana's Grove or Town.</HI></P>
<P>As this derivation carrieth a great semblance of truth with it, so the third,
viz. <HI>Llhandian</HI> carrieth as much, if not a greater verisimilitude, and weighs most
with me; The <HI>Brittains</HI> to this day, call a Church or Temple <HI>Llhan,</HI> whereof
there be a great number in <HI>Wales</HI> to this day, as <HI>Llhangorse, Llhansawel, Llhan∣dilo,
&amp;c.</HI> which signifieth the <HI>Churches</HI> of such <HI>places;</HI> And whereas by the Cur∣rent
and consentient opinion of all Antiquaries, there was a Pagan Temple, or
Fane erected to <HI>Diana,</HI> in that place where now St. <HI>Paul's</HI> stands, there being yet
there a place called <HI>Camera Dianae,</HI> where Oxe heads and bones are daily found,
which were used to be offered her as victims and sacrifices, I say, 'tis more then
probable, that the <HI>Britains</HI> were induc'd thereby to call the place <HI>Nhandian,</HI>
which is the <HI>Temple of Diana;</HI> and so in <HI>tract</HI> of time, the word was <HI>contracted,</HI> and
came to be called <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Now, who was the first <HI>Founder</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> is no where precisely found. But
whosoever first founded her, they shewed much prudence in the choyce of sci∣tuation;
For the happy and fortunate Estate of the City, hath given good proof,
that built she was in a good houre, when some propitious Starre was then the
ascendent, and marked for long life and continuance, and that she is for anti∣quity
very honourable; <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> giveth us to understand, that
she was called an <HI>ancient</HI> City in his time, which is above twelve hundred years
agoe; <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> doth seem to do the like three hundred years before, who
gives her this Character, <HI>Londinum copiâ Negotiatorum, &amp; commeatu valdè celebre</HI>
for multitude of Merchants, and commerce, <HI>London</HI> is very renowned: This
only was wanting to the glory thereof, that she had not the name of <HI>Free City,</HI>
nor of Colony; Neither indeed had it stood with the Roman interest, if any
City flourishing with Trade, should have enjoyed the right of a <HI>Free City;</HI> And
therefore it was, as may be well supposed, that they ordain'd her to be a <HI>Pre∣fecture,</HI>
for so they term'd Towns where <HI>Marts</HI> were kept, and Justice admini∣stred,
yet so that they had no Magistrates of their own, but rulers were sent eve∣ry
year to govern them, and for to execute Law in publick matters, namely of
Tax, Tribute, Tolls, Customs, Warfare, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the <HI>Senate of Rome;</HI> Hence it
commeth, that <HI>Tacitus</HI> the Panegyrist, and <HI>Marcellinus</HI> aforesaid, call her only
a <HI>Town;</HI> But although she was not lostier in name, yet in Wealth, Riches, and
Prosperity, she flourished as much as any other, yea and continued alwayes the
same, under the Dominions of <HI>Romans, Saxons,</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> seldom or never
afflicted with any great calamities. In the raign of <HI>Nero,</HI> when the <HI>Britains</HI> had
conspired to recover, and resume their liberty, under the Conduct of <HI>Baodicia,</HI>
the <HI>Londoncrs</HI> could not with all their vveepings hold <HI>Suetonius Paulinus,</HI> but
that after he had leavied a power of the Citizens to ayd him, he would needes
dislodge, and remove from thence, leaving the City naked to the Enemy, who
forthwith surprized and slew some few, whom either weakness of Sex, feeble∣nesse
of age, or sweetness of the place had detained there: Neither had she su∣stained
lesse losse, and misery, at the hands of the <HI>Gaules,</HI> if she had not sudden∣ly,
and beyond all expectation by Gods providence bin relieved; For when C.
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
<HI>Alectus</HI> had by a deceitful stratagem, made away <HI>Cara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sius,</HI> who taking advan∣tage
of our rough Seas, and of <HI>Dioclesians</HI> dangerous Warres in the East, and
withall, presuming of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> (now <HI>French)</HI> and most venturous Marriners,
and Servitors at Sea, withheld to himself the Revenues of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI>
and born for the space of six years, the Title of <HI>Emperour Augustus,</HI> as his Coines
here very oft do shew: When M. <HI>Aurelius Asclepiedotus</HI> had in a Battail slain
<HI>Alectus</HI> in the third year now of his Usurpation of the Imperial Purple and
State, those <HI>French</HI> who remained alive after the Battle hastening to <HI>London,</HI>
would have sack'd the City, had not the <HI>Thames,</HI> who never fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d to help the
<HI>Londoners,</HI> very opportunely brought in the Roman Legions, who by reason of
a Fog at Sea, were severed from the Navy: For they put the <HI>Barbarians</HI> to the
Sword, all the City over, and thereby gave the Citizens, not only safety by the
slaughter of their Enemies, but pleasure in beholding such a sight; And then it
was, as our Chronicles record that <HI>Lucius Gallus</HI> was slain by a Brook side, which
ran almost through the middle of the City, and of him was called by the Bri∣tish
<HI>Nantgall,</HI> in English <HI>Wallbrook;</HI> which name remains yet in a Street, un∣der
which there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewer within the ground, to rid away the filth, and ordures
of the City, Not far from <HI>London-stone,</HI> which I take to be a <HI>Mile-mark</HI> or <HI>Mil∣liary,</HI>
such as was in the Market places at Roms, from which were taken dimen∣sions
of all journies, every way, considering it is neer the midst of the City, as
it lyeth in length. Neither is it probable, she was yet wall'd about; But a little
after our Stories report, that <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, at the instance of his Mo∣ther
<HI>Helena,</HI> did first fence her about with a Wall made of rough stone, and Bri∣tish
Bricks, which took up in compasse, above three miles, so that it inclosed the
Model of the City almost four-square, but not equal on every side, considering,
that from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>VVest,</HI> she is far longer then from <HI>South</HI> to <HI>North.</HI> That part
of this Wall which stood on the <HI>Thames</HI> side, is by the continual flowing, and
washings of the River fallen down and decayed; yet there appear'd certain re∣mains
thereof in <HI>Henry</HI> the seconds time, as <HI>Fitzstephen,</HI> who then liv'd doth
testifie. The rest now standing, is stronger towards the <HI>North,</HI> which not ma∣ny
years since, was reedified by the meanes of <HI>Ioceline,</HI> Lord Mayor of <HI>London;</HI>
But towards <HI>East</HI> and <HI>VVest,</HI> although the <HI>Barons</HI> in old time, during their
Warres, repaired and renewed it with the ruynes of the <HI>Iewes</HI> houses then de∣molished,
yet it grew quickly, all thorow, out of decay; For <HI>Londoners</HI> like to
those old <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> laughed at strong walled Towns, as <HI>Cot-houses for Wo∣men,</HI>
thinking their own Cities sufficiently fenc'd, when they are fortified with
<HI>bones,</HI> and not with <HI>stones.</HI></P>
<P>This Wall giveth entrance at seven principal double Gates; for I willingly
omit the smaller, which as they have bin lately repaired, so they have also new
names given them;</P>
<P>On the <HI>West</HI> side there be two, to wit, <HI>Ludgate</HI> of King <HI>Lud</HI> a <HI>Britain;</HI>
or <HI>Flud-gate,</HI> as <HI>Leland</HI> is of opinion, of a little flud running beneath it,
like as the Gate <HI>Fluentana</HI> in Rome, built again from the foundation; This
Gate was made a free Prison, <HI>Anno 1378, Bremer</HI> being Major, which was con∣firm'd
1382. by a Common Councel in the <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> where 'twas ordained,
that all Freemen of <HI>London</HI> should for debts, trespasses, accounts, and con∣tempts,
be imprisoned in <HI>Ludgate,</HI> where at first for lodging and water, they did
not pay any thing. We go next to <HI>Newgate,</HI> the fairest of all the Gates so call'd
from the newness thereof, whereas before it was call'd <HI>Chamberlane Gate,</HI> which
now is the publick Gaol or Prison for Criminalls; and also for civil actions, for
the County of <HI>Middlesex.</HI> And it hath bin so many Ages, as appears by Records
in King <HI>Iohns</HI> time; as also in King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, who (as an old Authour
testifieth) sent a Command to the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> to repair the Gaol of <HI>New∣gate.</HI></P>
<P>On the North side are four Gates, viz. <HI>Aldersgate,</HI> or <HI>Oldersgate</HI> from the
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
antiquity thereof, or as others would have it from <HI>Aldrich</HI> a <HI>Saxon;</HI> the se∣cond
is <HI>Cripplegate</HI> of a Spitle of Cripples sometimes adjoyning thereunto;
The third is <HI>Mooregate,</HI> call'd so of a <HI>Moory</HI> ground hard by, which is now
draind up, and made fair and firm, and turn'd into a field &amp; delightful walks.
Which Gate was first built by <HI>Fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oner</HI> Lord Mayor, in the year of our Lord
1414. Then <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> of a Bishop the Benefactor; which Gate the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mar∣chants,
or <HI>Hans</HI> of the <HI>Styliard</HI> were bound by Covenant both to repair, and de∣fend
at all times of danger and extremity.</P>
<P>On the East side there is <HI>Aldgate,</HI> so named from the oldnesse, or <HI>Elbegate</HI>
as others terme it, which hath bin oft re-edified; It is thought, that two Gates
more stood, besides the Bridge gate, by the Thames side, namely <HI>Belmsgate,</HI> now
a Wharfe or a Key for the <HI>Scots</HI> Trade; and <HI>Donregate</HI> or the Watergate, com∣monly
call'd <HI>Dowgate.</HI></P>
<P>There be some <HI>Posterns</HI> besides that may go for Gates, as that of <HI>Christs Ho∣spital,</HI>
which was made in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth; Another was made
out of the wall lately into Moorfields. But the <HI>Postern</HI> by the <HI>Tower</HI> shews
that it hath bin very ancient, and an arch'd Gate of much trust; for in times
past there was alwaies a person of quality who was <HI>Custos</HI> of that <HI>Posterne.</HI> To∣wards
the Rivers side, there are also many water gates for the better security of
the City.</P>
<P>Where the wall endeth towards the River, there were two strong Forts or
Bastions, of which the one Eastward remaineth yet, usually called the <HI>Tower</HI> of
<HI>London,</HI> called in the old British <HI>Bringwin,</HI> or <HI>Tourgwin,</HI> which in English is,
the White Tower; a most famous and goodly Cittadel encompassed about
with thick and strong Walls, full of lofty, and stately Turrets, fenc'd about
with a broad and a deep ditch, furnish'd also with an Armory or Magazine of
Warlick munition, with other buildings besides, so that it resembleth a Town of
it self; and one may well suppose, that those two Castles which <HI>Fitz-stephens</HI> re∣cordeth
to have bin on the <HI>East side</HI> of this City, went both to the making of this
one: The other Fort was on the <HI>West side</HI> of this City, where <HI>Fleet</HI> a little riveret
ran, whence <HI>Fleetstreet</HI> took its name, and in time, it was able to bear Vessels,
as appears in some Parliament Rolls, which Riveret dischargeth it self into the
<HI>Thames. Fitz Stephen</HI> calls this the <HI>Palatin</HI> Tower or Castle; And they write,
that in the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, it was consumed by fire, out of
the ruines whereof a great part of Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, was newly built; And
also on the very plot of ground where it stood, <HI>Robert Kilwarby</HI> ArchBishop of
<HI>Canterbury</HI> founded a Religious House for the <HI>Dominican</HI> Fryars, whence we
call the place <HI>Black-fryars;</HI> whereby a man may easily guess of what bigness
it was; howbeit, in that place, stood in the dayes of <HI>Henry</HI> the second <HI>(Gervase</HI>
of <HI>Tilbury</HI> in his Book call'd <HI>Otia Imperialia</HI> is my Author) two Forts or Ram∣parts,
the one whereof belong'd to <HI>Bainard,</HI> the other to the <HI>Baron of Mon∣fichet</HI>
by right of succession, but nothing remaineth of them to this day; yet
some think that <HI>Pembroke</HI> House was a piece of them, which we term <HI>Bainards
Castle,</HI> of <HI>Bainard</HI> a noble man of <HI>Dunmow,</HI> whose possession sometimes it was,
&amp; whose Successors the <HI>Fitz Waters</HI> were in right of inheritance, who were <HI>En∣sign-bearers</HI>
of the City of <HI>London,</HI> (as shall be told hereafter) and among them
<HI>Robert Fitz water,</HI> had licence of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the first, to sell the Site of <HI>Bainards</HI>
Castle to the forenamed ArchBishop <HI>Kilwarby.</HI> Neither was this City at that
time <HI>wall'd</HI> only, but also when the <HI>Flamins</HI> or Pagan Priests were taken away,
and <HI>Christian</HI> Religion established under that good Emperour <HI>Constantine,</HI> a Bi∣shop
was install'd in their room▪ for it appeareth at the Councel of <HI>Arles,</HI>
which in the year of grace 314 was held under the said <HI>Constantine</HI> the great, the
<HI>Bishop of London</HI> was present; for he subscribed, as it is to be seen in the first
Tome of the Councel in this manner. <HI>Restitutus, Bishop in the City of London
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
out of the Province of great Britain;</HI> Which <HI>Restitutus</HI> and his Successors, had
their Seat and residence as some affirm, as Saint <HI>Peters in Cornhil.</HI></P>
<P>From that time, <HI>London</HI> flourished in such honour, that she began to be call'd
<HI>Augusta,</HI> and by that name was famous under the Emperour <HI>Valentinian;</HI> For
<HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> in his 27 Book writeth thus, <HI>And going forward to
London an ancient Town which posterity call'd Augusta:</HI> and in the 28 Book,
He went from <HI>Augusta,</HI> which men of old time call'd <HI>London;</HI> Whence it came
that after <HI>Constantine's</HI> time, there was a <HI>Mint</HI> appointed therein; For we read
in those Pieces of Money, which he caused to be stamp'd in honour of his Fa∣ther
<HI>Constantius,</HI> and in others; this was the Inscription, <HI>P. Lon. S.</HI> that is
<HI>Pecunia Londino signata,</HI> Mony stamp'd in London. He who had the charge and
overseeing thereof under the <HI>Comes of Sacrarum largitionum,</HI> is in the Book of
<HI>Notice</HI> term'd, <HI>Praepositus the saurorum Augustensium</HI> in Britannia, that is, Provost
of the Treasury of <HI>Augusta</HI> or London, in Britany. For this name <HI>Augusta</HI>
was a name full of Dignity and Majesty; And both Founders and Repairers of
Cities, when they hoped or wish'd, that such Cities would become flourishing
and powerful, gave them significant names of good fortune; But among the
most auspicious names that be, none is more magnificent, none more auspicate
and glorious than <HI>Augusta.</HI> For, this of <HI>Augustus,</HI> the most gracious &amp; mighty
Emperour <HI>Octavianus</HI> took unto himself, not without the judgment of the best
learned. Sirnamed he was, saith <HI>Dio, Augustus</HI> as one of great Majesty above
the nature of man: for what things be most honourable and sacred, are called
<HI>Augusta:</HI> Neither had <HI>London</HI> this name for so high an honour, without the
Licence of the Roman Emperours; In regard that names could not be im∣pos'd
upon Cities without authority, as <HI>Virgil</HI> notes in that verse of his;
<Q><L>Urbem appellabant, permisso nomine, <HI>Acestam.</HI></L>
<L>The City, by permission, <HI>Acesta</HI> they did name.</L></Q>
But as continuance of time has outworne this so honorable a name of <HI>Augusta:</HI>
to it hath confirm'd that other most ancient name <HI>Londinum.</HI> Whiles it enjoy'd
the foresaid name <HI>Augusta,</HI> it scaped fair from destruction by a rebellious rout of
Ransakers; But <HI>Theodosius</HI> the father of <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Emperour did cut them
in pieces whiles they were encombred with their spoils, &amp; entred, as <HI>Mareia∣nus</HI>
saith, with exceeding great joy in triumphant manner into the City distressed
before, &amp; overwhelm'd with grievous calamities; And marching with his Army
from thence, he by his valour and prowesse, so freed <HI>Britain</HI> from those intolera∣ble
calamities and dangers wherewith she was beset, that the <HI>Romans,</HI> as witnes∣seth
<HI>Symmachus,</HI> honored him among other ancient Worthies, and men of high
renown with the Statue of a man of Arms. Not long after, when the Romans
Empire in <HI>Britain</HI> was come to an end, in that publick destiny, and fatal de∣fection
of the whole State, it fell unto the <HI>English Saxons,</HI> but in what sort, it is
not well agreed on among Authors; It is most probable that <HI>Vortigern</HI> to re∣deem
himself, being taken prisoner, delivered it for his ransome unto <HI>Hengist</HI>
the <HI>Saxon,</HI> considering that it did belong unto the <HI>East Saxons,</HI> whose Coun∣trey
also, as Writers do record, <HI>Vortigern</HI> upon that condition made over unto
<HI>Hengist.</HI></P>
<P>At which time the state of the Church went also to wrack, and endured sore
affliction; the Pastors were either slain, or forc'd to fly, their flocks worried,
and havock made of all, as well Church goods as others. <HI>Theon</HI> the last Bishop
of <HI>London</HI> of the British blood, was fain to hide the holy Relique of Saints for
a memorial, as my Author saith, and not for any superstition. But although
those daies of the <HI>English Saxons</HI> were such, that a man might truly say, <HI>Mars</HI>
then brandished and shook his weapons, yet was <HI>London</HI> neverthelesse, as <HI>Bede</HI>
testifieth, a Town of Trade, and traffique, frequented by many Nations resor∣ting
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
thither by Sea and Land; But afterwards when a more gracious gale of
peace breath'd favourably upon this wearied Island, and the English <HI>Saxon</HI> be∣gan
to professe Christianity, it also began to flourish afresh; for <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King
of <HI>Kent,</HI> under whom <HI>Sebert</HI> raign'd in this tract, as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Vassal, and by
courtesie, founded here a Church, and did consecrate it to Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> which
being soon reedified and repaired, became at last most stately and magnificent,
it was endowed by degrees with fair revenues, &amp; livings, wherewith were main∣tain'd
a <HI>Bishop,</HI> a <HI>Dean,</HI> a <HI>Chanter,</HI> a <HI>Chancellour,</HI> a <HI>Treasurer,</HI> fire <HI>Archdeacons,</HI>
thirty <HI>Prebendaries,</HI> and divers other Incumbents and Officers, who might have
a hansome subsistence thereby.</P>
<P>The <HI>East</HI> part of this Church seems to be the newer, and more curiously
wrought, having under it a very fair large arch'd Vault, which also is Saint
<HI>Faiths</HI> Church; It was built out of the ruines of that Castle Palatine (spoken of
before) by <HI>Mauritius</HI> the <HI>Bishop,</HI> about the year of our Lord 1086, whereas it
had been formerly consum'd by a wofull accidental fire, whereof <HI>William</HI> of
<HI>Mamesbury</HI> writeth thus; <HI>The beauty whereof is so magnificent, that it deserves to
be numbred in the rank of the most excellent Edifices, so large as that arck'd Vault
underneath, and the Church above it of such capacity that it may seem sufficient
to receive any multitudes of people whatsoever.</HI> Because therefore Bishop <HI>Mau∣rice</HI>
carried a mind beyond all measure in this project, he transmitted the cost
and charge of so laborious a piece of work unto those that came after: In the
end, when B. <HI>Richard</HI> his Successor had made over all the Revenues belonging
unto the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shoprick to the building of this Cathedrall Church; sustaining him∣self
and his family otherwise in the mean while, he seemed in a manner to
have done just nothing, notwithstanding that he spent his whole substance
thereabout, and yet small effects came thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>West</HI> part, as also the <HI>Cross Isle</HI> are very spacious, high built, and goodly to
be seen by reason of such huge Columns, and are marvellously beautified with an
arch'd roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of stone. Where these four parts crosse one another &amp; meet in one,
there ariseth up a mighty large &amp; lofty <HI>Tower,</HI> upon which stood a spire Steeple,
cover'd with lead, mounting up to a wonderful altitude; for it was no less than
five hundred, and five and thirty foot high from the ground, which in the year
1087, was set on fire by lightning, and burnt with a great part of the City, but
being rebuilt, was afterwards fi'rd again with lightening about an hundred and
fifty years ago, and was not perfectly repair'd ever since.</P>
<P>The measure and proportion of this stately structure, shall be here set down
out of an old authentick Writer, who saith, that Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> Church containeth
in length 690 foot, the breadth thereof is 130 foot, the height of the West
arch'd roof from the ground carrieth 102 foot, and the new fabrique from the
ground is 88 foot high, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The ground belonging to this great Temple, in nature of a Coemitery or Church
yard was of vast expansion, for, it reach'd <HI>North,</HI> as far as St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> market
place; <HI>West,</HI> almost as far as <HI>Ludgate;</HI> and <HI>South,</HI> near to <HI>Baynards Castle:</HI> Now, as

Sanctuary, but a long tract of time, and some Ages pass'd before it came to be
entirely compleated, and made a perfect <HI>Crosse,</HI> which is the exact shape of it.
Nor did there want many advantages, according to the Genius of those times,
to advance the work▪ for persons of good rank, besides pecuniary Contributi∣ons,
did labour themselves therein, in their own persons, thinking to do God
Almighty good service, to have a hand in rearing up his Temple; Besides, It
was an ordinary thing, for the ghostly Father to lay penances upon some peni∣tentiaries,
as Masons, Carpenters, Bricklayers, Playsterers, and others to work
so many daies <HI>gratis</HI> in the building, before they could get an absolution; In∣somuch,

That there stood in old time, a <HI>Fane</HI> or Pagan Temple to <HI>Diana,</HI> in this place,
(as before was hinted) some have more than only <HI>conjectur'd,</HI> for there are Ar∣guments
to make this conjecture good; Certain old houses adjoyning are in
the ancient Records of the Church call'd <HI>Diana's Chamber;</HI> and in the Church∣yard,
while <HI>Edward</HI> the first raign'd, an incredible number of Ox-heads were
found, as we find in our Annals, which the common sort at that time wondred
at, as the sacrifices of the Gentiles: and the learned know, that <HI>Taurapolia</HI> were
celebrated to the honour of <HI>Diana.</HI></P>
<P>But ever since this Temple was erected, it hath been the See of the Bishops of
<HI>London:</HI> and the first Bishop it had under the English, some hundred years after
<HI>Theon</HI> the <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> Bishop, was <HI>Melitus</HI> a <HI>Roman,</HI> consecrated by <HI>Austin</HI>
Archbishop of Canterbury, in honour of which <HI>Austin,</HI> (though flat against
the Decree of Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the great) the Ensigns of the Archbishoprick, and
the <HI>Metropolitan</HI> See were translated from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>Within this grand Cathedral, there lieth Saint <HI>Erkenwald,</HI> as also <HI>Sebba</HI> King
of the East <HI>Saxons,</HI> who gave over his Kingdom to serve Christ: King <HI>Etheldred,</HI>
who was an oppresser rather than a Ruler of this Kingdom, cruel in the begin∣ning,
wretched in the middle, and shameful in his end; so outragious he was
in connivency to parricides, so infamous in his flight and effeminacy, and so
disastrrous in his death; <HI>Henry Lacy</HI> Earl of <HI>Lincoln, Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> Duke of
<HI>Lancaster,</HI> Sir <HI>Simon de Burlie,</HI> a right noble Knight of the Garter, executed by
encroch'd authority without the Kings assent, Sir <HI>Iohn de Beauchamp</HI> Lord

Sir <HI>Francis Walsingham,</HI> two famous Knights; Sir <HI>Christopher Hatton</HI> Lord

<HI>Resurrection.</HI></P>
<P>Besides this Church, there is not any other work of the English <HI>Saxons</HI> ex∣tant
in <HI>London;</HI> for why, they continued not long in perfect peace, considering
that the <HI>VVest Saxons</HI> subdued the <HI>East Saxons,</HI> and <HI>London</HI> began to be tribu∣tary
to the <HI>Mercians;</HI> Scarcely were these civil Wars hush'd, when a new tempest
brake out of the North, I mean the <HI>Danes,</HI> who pitiously tore in pieces this
whole Countrey, and shook this City very sore; for the <HI>Danes</HI> brought her un∣der
subjection, but <HI>Alfred</HI> recover'd her out of their hands; and after he had
repair'd her, he gave her unto <HI>Ethelred</HI> Earl of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> who had married
his daughter; yet those wastful depopulators, did what they could afterwards
to win her by siege: but <HI>Canutus,</HI> who specially by digging a new Channel, at∣tempted
to turn away the <HI>Thames</HI> from her, though the labour was lost, the
Citizens did still manfully repel the force of the enemy; yet were they alarm'd
and terrified ever and anon by them, until they lovingly receiv'd and admitted
as their King <HI>VVilliam</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> whom God design'd to be born for
the good of <HI>England</HI> against those so many spoilers; presently whereupon, the
winds were layed, the clouds dispell'd, and golden daies shone upon her: since
which time she never sustain'd any signal calamity, but through the special fa∣vour,
and indulgence of Heaven, and bounty of Princes, obtain'd very
large and great immunities: for she began to be call'd the <HI>Kings Chamber,</HI>
and so flourished anew with fresh Trade, and concourse of Marchants, that
<HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury</HI> who liv'd nere those times term'd it <HI>A noble and weal∣thy
City,</HI> replenish'd with rich Citizens, and frequented with the Commerce of
Occupiers, and Factors coming from all parts; <HI>Fitz-Stephen</HI> living also in those
daies hath left in writing, that <HI>London</HI> at that time counted 122 Parish Chur∣ches,
and thirteen <HI>Convents</HI> or Monasteries of Religious Orders; Moreover, he
relates, that when a Muster was made of able men to bear Arms, they brought
into the field under divers Colours 40000 Foot, and 20000 Horsemen.</P>

<HI>London</HI> about this time began to display h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r wings, and spread her train very
wide; <HI>Buildings</HI> did much increase, and the Suburbs strerch'd forth from the

be best peopled, and the civillest part. For there, all the twelve <HI>Inns of Court</HI>

besides the Law; that for a choyse way of Education and Gallantry, Sir
<HI>Iohn Fortescue,</HI> in his Treatise of the Lawes of <HI>England,</HI> doth affirm, It is not in∣ferior
to any place of Christendom: The said four principal Houses are the <HI>In∣ner
Temple,</HI> the <HI>middle Temple, Graies Inne,</HI> and <HI>Lincolns Iune;</HI> The two former
stand in the very same place, where in times pass'd, during the Raign of King
<HI>Henry</HI> the second, <HI>Heraclius</HI> Patriark of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> consecrated a Church for
the Knight-Templers, which they had newly built, according to the form of the
Temple, neer unto the Sepulcher of our Saviour at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> for at their first
Institution, about the yeer of our Lord 1113. they dwelt in part of the Temple,
hard by the Holy Sepulcher, whereof they were so named, and vow'd to defend
Christian Religion, the Holy Land, and Pilgrims going to visit the holy Sepul∣cher,
against all <HI>Mahumetans</HI> and <HI>Infidels,</HI> professing to live in chastity and obe∣dience;
whereupon, all men voluntarily, and with candid Christian hearts em∣brac'd
and honor'd them: so that through the royal munificence of Princes, and
other devout people, having got very fair possessions, and exceeding great wealth
they flourish'd in a high reputation for piety and devotion; yea, out of an
opinion of the holiness of the men, and of the <HI>Place,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and
many Noblemen desired much to be buried in their Church among them, where
some of their Statues are to be seen crosse-legd to this day; for so they were u∣sed
to be buried in that Age, having taken upon them the <HI>Crosse</HI> to serve in the
holy Warres, and vow'd the same accordingly: among whom, was <HI>William
Marshall</HI> the elder, a powerful man in his time; <HI>VVilliam</HI> and <HI>Gilbert</HI> his Sonnes
Marshals of <HI>England,</HI> and Earls of <HI>Pembroke.</HI> Upon <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Elder, there

<P>But in process of time, when with insatiable greediness, they had hoarded

turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to their ruine; which may be one day the fortune of the Jesuites, as I

this <HI>Order</HI> was condemned of impiety &amp; other hainous crimes, &amp; all this by the

were utte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly abolished. Nevertheless, their possessions here, were by Autho∣rity
of Parliament, assigned unto the Knights <HI>Hospitalers</HI> of St. <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Ierusa∣lem,</HI>
lest that such Lands given to Religious and good uses, should be alienated
against the pious <HI>Donors</HI> Wills. Yet it appeares in ancient writings, that this
place, after the expulsion of the <HI>Templers,</HI> was the Seat and Habitation of <HI>Thomas</HI>
Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and Sir <HI>Hugh Spencer,</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the seconds Minion, after∣wards
of Sir <HI>Aimer de Valence,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> and in the end turned to two
Colleges or Inns of Court for the study of the Lawes; The other two great

Neer unto this, <HI>Henry</HI> the third erected between the two Temples, <HI>a House

from <HI>Iudaisme</HI> to Christianity, which <HI>Edward</HI> the third afterwards made an <HI>Ar∣chive,</HI>

<P>In the yeer 1381. the Rebels of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Kent,</HI> among other places destroy∣ed
and pulled down the Lodgings and Houses of this Temple, took out of the
Church the Books and Records, that were in hutches of the Apprentices of the
Law, carried them out into the street, and burnt them. The House they spoiled,
and burnt also, out of an hatred they bore to Sir <HI>Robert Hales,</HI> Lord Prior of St.

John's,</HI> was accounted the first Parliamentary Peer of <HI>England;</HI> But the said

<HEAD>Of fresh water Rivers, Aqueducts, Conduits,
and Fountains that belong to the City of
LONDON.</HEAD>
<P>AS, the principal thing that conduceth to the health of humane bodies,
is the blood that runneth through their Veins, so the chiefest thing that
tends to the welfare of a City, is to have Springs and Conduits of
fresh water run within her: therefore we will proceed now; to give an
account of those ancient and present Rivers, Brooks, Boorns, Pools, Wells,
Conduits, and Aqueducts, which serve to refresh the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>In former Ages, until the Conquerors time, and long after; the City of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
was watred (besides the River of <HI>Thames</HI> on the South part) with the River
of <HI>Wells,</HI> as it was then call'd, and on the <HI>West</HI> with water call'd <HI>Wallbrook,</HI> run∣ning
through the midst of the City, to pay Tribute unto the Thames. There was
another water or boorn, which run within the City through <HI>Langborn</HI> Ward,
watring the East part; In the West Suburbs was also another great Water call'd
<HI>Oldborn,</HI> which had its fall into the River of Wells. Then were there 3. princi∣pal
Fountains or Wells in the other Suburbs, to wit, Holy Well, Clements Well,
and Clarks Well; Near unto this last named Fountain, were divers other Wells,
viz. <HI>Fags well, Skinners well, Tode well, Loders well,</HI> and <HI>Rad well.</HI> All which Wells
having the fall of their over-flowings into the said River, much encreased the
stream, and in that place, gave it the name of Well: In West-Smithfield, there
was a Pool in Records, called <HI>Horse pool,</HI> and another in the Parish of St.<HI>Giles</HI>
without Cripplegate; Besides which, they had in every street, and lane of the
City, divers fair Wells, and fresh Springs, after which manner, the City was then
served with sweet and fresh waters, which being since decayed, other meanes
have bin found to supply the want: But the prime and principal device was
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
found out by that worthy <HI>Briton,</HI> and Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton,</HI> by
whose wit, care, and cost, the new River of <HI>Ware</HI> was brought from <HI>Chadwel,</HI>
and <HI>Amwel,</HI> to water and refresh the heart, and bowels of the City; The bu∣siness
was long in suspence, and under weighty deliberation, it receiv'd heat and
cold a long time, being exposed to so many difficulties, and vast expence, able
to terrifie the stoutest man. At last, courage and resolution, with a love to the
publique good met in the breast of the Adventurer, and spur'd him on to so glo∣rious
an enterprise, which hath proved so happily commodious, and of such
infinite utility to the whole City, that had he lived under some other Meridians,
that I know, he should have had his Statue erected in the eminentest place of
the City, to eternize his name &amp; transmit his memory, and keep it fresh (like his
waters) to all future Ages; Now as Mr. <HI>Stow</HI> speaks very ingeniously, if those ene∣mies
to all good actions, Danger, difficulty detraction, contempt, scorn, &amp; envy,
could have prevail'd by their malevolent interposition, either before, at the be∣ginning,
and in the very birth of the attempt, and a good while after; this work
had never bin accomplished.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> gave way, by act of Parliament, to her Citizens of
<HI>London,</HI> and power for cutting and conveying of a River from any part of
<HI>Middlesex</HI> or <HI>Hartfordshire</HI> into the City of <HI>London,</HI> with a limitation of ten
years time for the performance thereof; but that Enterprize expir'd with her
life: King <HI>James</HI> her immediate successor, did grant the like, but without-date
of time for the same effect; And when the courage of others were quite
quail'd and utterly refused the business, Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton</HI> did undertake it,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o with infinite pains, and no lesse expence, he finish'd the work, by bring∣ing
a River of wholsom fine chearful water from <HI>Chadwel</HI> and <HI>Amwel,</HI> to the
North side of <HI>London,</HI> near <HI>Islington,</HI> where he built a large Cistern to receive it,
The work began the 28. day of February, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1608. and in the compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
of five years was fully compleated. Touching the Aquaeduct, or the convey∣ance
thereof to <HI>London,</HI> it hardly can be imagined, what difficulties and rubs
there were in the way, by reason of the various qualities of grounds, through
which the water was to passe; some being ozie, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oft, and muddy; others again
as stiffe, and craggy; The depth of the Trench in some places descended full
thirty foot and more, whereas in other places, it required as much artifice, to
mount it over a valley in troughs betwixt Hills, and those troughs to be sup∣ported
by woodden Arches, some of them fix'd in the Earth very deep, and ri∣sing
in height above 23. foot. Being brought to the foresaid great Cestern,
the water was not yet let in, till on Michaelmas day, <HI>Anno</HI> 1613. being the day
that Sir <HI>Thomas Middleton,</HI> Brother to the said <HI>Sir Hugh,</HI> was elected Lord
Maior of <HI>London</HI> for the year ensuing. In the afternoon of the same day, Sir
<HI>John Swinerton,</HI> then Lord Maior, accompanied with the said Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> Sir
<HI>Henry Mountague,</HI> Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> and many of the worthy Aldermen,
rode in a solemn manner, to see the great Cestern, and first issuing of the
strange River thereunto, which then was made free Denizon of <HI>London,</HI> and the
Solemnity was thus. A Troop of Labourers to the number of threescore, or
more, well apparell'd, and wearing green Monmouth Caps, after the <HI>British</HI>
manner, all alike, carried Spades, Shovels, Pickaxes, and such like Instruments
of laborious Employment, and marching after Drums, twice or thrice about
the Cistern, presented themselves before the Mount, where the Lord Mayor and
the Aldermen were, where after a handsome speech, the Flud-gates flew open,
the stream ran chearfully into the Cistern, the Drums and Trumpets sounding
in triumphant manner, and a gallant peal of Chambers gave a Period to the en∣tertainment.
A noble achievement it was, as this reracted to Sir <HI>Hugh Mid∣dleton,</HI>
doth partly set forth, which never saw publique light until now.

and Fulls, unto their first and last Quarters, so afterwards, they encrease again
until they come to the Fall and Change; sometimes they rise also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o high, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe∣cially
if the wind be at the North or North-east, which brings in the water
with more vehemency, because the tyde which fills the Channel cometh
Northward, that the <HI>Thames</HI> often inounds the bankes about <HI>London,</HI> which
happeneth most frequently in <HI>Ianuary</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> which makes the grounds,
afterwards more ferti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. Neither do the tydes after a whit, unlesse some im∣petuous
winds from the West or South-west, do keep back and check the
stream, as the East and North-East do hasten the coming in thereof or else
some other extraordinary occasion put by the course of the German Seas, which
do fill the River by their n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and flowings; And the probabiest
reason why three or four tydes do chop in in one day is, because the winds
blowing more strong than ordinarily North or North-east, make the Sea to
rush in with more speed, and abundance or water.</P>
<P>The Land streams or white waters, do oftentimes thicken the finenesse of the
River, in so much that after a Land floud, 'tis usual to take up Haddocks with
ones h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd beneath the Bridge, as they float aloft on the water, their eyes being
so blinded with the thicknesse of the water, that they cannot see whither they
swimme; and how to make shift for themselves before the poor crea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re be
surpriz'd, otherwise the <HI>Thames</HI> water useth to be as clear and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as any
such great River in the world.</P>
<P>Having gone along so fat with this great goodly River, even from her source
until she di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mboques, and payes Tribute to Nepume, and cast her self into his
imbraces, It will be now expedient to go on further, and acquaint the Rea∣der
with the jurisdiction, and Prerogatives of the <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes,</HI> with the extent
thereof, Which begins at a place call'd <HI>Colnie</HI> ditch, a little above <HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes</HI>-bridge,
We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ward as far as <HI>London</HI>-bridge, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom thence to a place call'd <HI>Yendil,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and the waters or <HI>Medmay,</HI> all which extent is under the juris∣diction
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
and conservancy of the Lord Mayor, the Comminalty, and Citizens
of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>True it is, that there have been some Contests betwixt the Lord Mayor, and
the Lord high Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> concerning the said Jurisdiction and pow∣er,
but after a fair and judicial Tryal in open Court, the controversie was de∣cided
in favour of the City; and the Lord Mayor adjudged to be <HI>Conservator of
the Thames.</HI></P>
<P>There were also some other controversial points about the Rivers, of <HI>Thames</HI>
and <HI>Medway,</HI> but all differences were absolutely concluded <HI>Anno</HI> 1613, Sir
<HI>Iohn Swinerton</HI> being then Lord Mayor, and Mr. <HI>Sparry</HI> being then his Deputy,
or respective Bayliff for the execution of such a great trust repos'd in him. Ever
since, is well as in former times, the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> hath been styl'd the
Conservator of the said River, within the forenamed limits and bounds, having
plenary power to inflict punishments upon all transgressors relating to the said
Rivers; the Water-Bayly of <HI>London</HI> being his substitute. And whereas there are
a company of Fishermen call'd <HI>Tinckermen,</HI> frequenting the River of <HI>Thames</HI>
Eastward, who in times pass'd have been reported, and found out to make an
infinit destruction of the young brood or fry of fish, by using unlawful Nets,
and other Engines feeding their Hoggs with them; by the singular care and
cost of the Lord Mayor, and vigilance of the City, those prohibited Engines
and Nets, are now quite suppress'd, and a true, and orderly manner of fish∣ing
brought into use, that such a havock may not be made of the young
fry.</P>
<P>Moreover, there are a great number of other kind of Fishermen, beside
Tinckermen belonging to the <HI>Thames,</HI> call'd <HI>Hebbermen, Petermen,</HI> and <HI>Traw∣lermen,</HI>
that had lived in former times, by unlawful fishing on the said River,
to the destruction of the young fish, as aforesaid; but now they are restrain'd,
and regulated to a more orderly way of fishing.</P>
<P>There have bin other kind of abuses reformed herein, as upon complaint
made to the Lord Mayor, concerning certain Timbers standing in <HI>Tilbury</HI>
Hope; a matter not only dangerous to the Passengers, but a cause also to de∣stroy
the young brood of fish, by the dammage those Timbers did to the Fisher∣mens
Nets, in regard of their continual standing in the main course, and cur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent
of the River: that great grievance was speedily redressed, by the provi∣dence
and prudence of the Lord Mayor, and the Water-Bayly.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there hath been care taken, to clear and cleanse the said noble
River Westward of seventy nine stops or hatches consisting of sundry great stakes
and piles, purposely erected by Fishermen for their private lucre, and standing
illfavouredly for passengers near unto the <HI>Fair deep;</HI> but none of them remain
now, but such as stand out of the passable high stream, and can be no prejudice
to passers by; yet some are permitted to be planted at the waters bottome,
and so they serve as a great succour to the young brood of fish, being placed so
remote on the River. Nor is this provident care for security of passengers, and
conservation of the young fry or fish, a new thing, for it appears that the like
course was kept in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and after in <HI>Henry</HI> the
eighth, as Records and Chronicles do shew. Moreover, there is a watchful eye,
that no carren, or dead carkasses be thrown into the River to pollute, or infect
the stream.</P>
<P>To all these intents and purposes, the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen his
Brethren with the under Officers, do use to meet eight times yearly, in the
four Counties of <HI>Middlesex, Surrey, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> and have a judicial sitting
for maintenance of the Rivers Rights, and Priviledges, where they have pow∣er
to empanel Juries, to make Inquisition after all offences committed upon
the River within their extent; And as the Verdict given up by the Jury make
it appear, so they proceed to the punishment of the transgressors, according to
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
the quality of the offence: and it is worthy the observation, to know the man∣ner
of their so solemn proceedings, whereof this instance shall be produced, ex∣tracted
out of authentick Records.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Iohn Iolles</HI> Knight and Lord Mayor of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Conserva∣tor
of the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and waters of <HI>Medway,</HI> assisted and accompanyed
by the Aldermen▪ and two Sheriffs then contemporary, and attended by the
Recorder; and the Sub-conservator, or Water-bayly, with fifty Officers and
servants, took their Barges at <HI>Belmsgate</HI> the third of <HI>Iuly</HI> 1616, and within few
hours arriv'd at <HI>Gravesend</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> where a Session for the conservancy of the
said River was kept before the said Lord Mayor, and his forenamed Assistants;
At which time and place, a Jury of the Freeholders of the said County, being
sworn to enquire of all offences committed in any part of the River whatsoe∣ver,
within the said County, the Common Sergeant of the City (the Recorder
being then absent upon extraordinary occasions) deliver'd them a charge to this
effect; That, forasmuch as there had not been any Session of Conservancy in
many years passed, kept by any Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> in that place, it was
probable and evident they could not be well informed, neither of the Lord
Mayors jurisdiction and power to reform annoyances and offences there, and
to inflict due punishments upon the Offendors; nor of the nature of the ser∣vice
to be by them performed in the course of their enquiry; therefore he
thought it convenient to make it known unto them, both the one and the
other. Hereupon he shew'd them, The Jurisdiction of the Court of <HI>London</HI> in the
River of <HI>Thames,</HI> from <HI>Stanes</HI>-bridge Westward unto the points of the River
next the Sea Eastward, appear'd to belong to the City in manner and form fol∣lowing.</P>
<P>First, In point of right by <HI>Praescription,</HI> as it appeareth by an ancient Book
call'd <HI>Dunthorne,</HI> that, <HI>Civitatis fundationis, aedificationis, &amp; constructionis cau∣sa
erat Thamesis Fluvius, quorum vero Civitatis &amp; Fluminis gubernationem tam
Duces, Majores, Custodes, Vicecomites, Aldr. &amp; magnates Civitatis memoratae
hucusque obtinuerunt &amp; habuerunt;</HI> Whence he inferr'd, that the government of
the River hath belong'd to the City, time out of mind. In 21. <HI>Hen. 3. Iorden
Coventry</HI> one of the Sheriffs of the City, was sent by the Mayor and Aldermen,
to remove certain Kiddles that annoy'd the Rivers of <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Medway,</HI>
who <HI>ultra Yenland versus Mare,</HI> did take divers persons that were Offendors,
and imprison'd them; Whereupon, complaint being made to the King, he
took the matter ill at the first, and sent for the Lord Mayor and Citizens to
<HI>Kennington;</HI> where, upon hearing of the matter before the said King▪ the Cityes
Jurisdiction over the said River, was set forth and allow'd, and the Complai∣nants
convinc'd, and every one of them amerc'd at 10 <HI>l.</HI> and the amercements
adjudged to the City; And afterward, their Nets were burnt by judgement
given by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen in the <HI>Hustings,</HI> Moreover, 1. <HI>Ri∣chardi
secundi,</HI> Writs were directed to the Sheriffs of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Kent</HI> reciting
the Cities Title, with command, not to suffer the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> to
be molested contrary to the Liberties formerly granted, and allowed unto
them.</P>
<P>Secondly, in point of right <HI>by allowance in Eire,</HI> the conservation of the <HI>Thames</HI>
belongs to the City: for it was produc'd that 1. <HI>Rich.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. before <HI>Hugh Bigot</HI> be∣ing
Justice Itinerant, the Sheriffs and Citizens of <HI>London</HI> were call'd in question
for their Jurisdiction exercised on the <HI>Thames,</HI> before whom it was found by a
Jury in <HI>Southwark, Quod nullus habeat aliquid juris in Thamisia usque ad novum
gurgitem nisi Cives Londonens.</HI> In the 14. of <HI>Ed.</HI> 2. the Constable of the <HI>Tower,</HI> was
indited by divers Wards of <HI>London,</HI> before the Justices in <HI>Eire</HI> at the <HI>Tower,
De muneris et recep. cove. pro kidellis in Thamisiis, et Constabularius ad Kidellas
respondet quód Iustic. non habent jurisdictionem extra</HI> London <HI>plitum, inde cognos∣cere
cum predict. kidelli sunt in aliis comitatibus, et Justic. dixerunt, Aqua Thamisiae
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
pertinet ad Civitatem London usque mart, &amp; si velit respondeat,</HI> who then pleaded,
Not guilty.</P>
<P>3. He went further, that this Jurisdiction belonged to the City <HI>by ancient
Charters, 8. R. 1. Dominus Ricardus Rex, filius Regis Henrici secundi concessit,
&amp; firmiter praecepit, ut omnes Kidelli qui sunt in Thamisia amoveantur ubicunque fu∣erint
in Thamisia; 1. Ioh. Rex. concessit, &amp; firmiter praecepit, ut omnes kidelli
qui sunt in Thamisia vel in Medway amoveantur, &amp; ne caeteri kidelli alicubi po∣nantur
in Thamisia vel in Medway super sort: X. li. sterlingorum.</HI> Then he urg'd
the famous Charter of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, which ran thus. <HI>Henry</HI> by the
Grace of God, King of <HI>England,</HI> Lord of <HI>Ireland,</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy</HI> and <HI>A∣quitaine,</HI>
and Earl of <HI>Anjou</HI> unto all Archbishops, Bishops Abbots, Priors Earls,
Barons, Justices Sheriffs, Stewards, Ministers, and to all Bayliffs, and to all
his true Men, Greeting: Woreth well, that We for the health of our soul, and
the health of the soul of King <HI>John</HI> our Fader, and the souls of all our Ancestors;
and also for common profit of our City of <HI>London,</HI> and of all our Realms, have
granted, and steadfastly commanded; That all the Weares that be in Thames, or
in Medway be done away; And that from henceforth no Weares be set in
Thames or Medway, upon the forfeiture of 10. l. Also we claim quit to our
Citizens of <HI>London</HI> all that, that our Constable of our <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> was
wont to take of the said Weares. Wherefore we will, and steadfastly command
that no Constable of the aforesaid Tower, at any time from henceforth forward
any thing ask, nor any grievance do, to any of the same City, by enchesen of the
same Weares; It is to us known enough, and by true men, do us to understand,
that most privacy, and most profit might fall into the same City, and to the
whole Realm by enchesen of the same weares; which we make for ever firm
and stable unto the same City, as the Charter of our Lord King <HI>John,</HI> our Fader,
which our Barons of <HI>London,</HI> thereof have reasonably witnessed. Witnesses,
<HI>Eustace</HI> of <HI>London, Peter</HI> of <HI>Winchester,</HI> &amp;c. At <HI>Westminster</HI> the 18. of February,
the year of our Reign eleven. Besides these, he produced divers others in this
Kings Raign.</P>
<P>4. This Jurisdiction belongs to the City of <HI>London,</HI> by <HI>Acts of Parliament.
W. 2. ca. 47. An.</HI> 13. No Salmons to be taken, from the Nativity of our La∣dy,

2. Offence, imprisonment for a quarter of a yeer. 3. A whole year,
13. R. 2. confirms the restraint of taking Salmons in many waters, from the
midst of April, until Midsommer, upon the same pain; nor within that time
to use any Nets call'd <HI>Stalkers,</HI> nor any other Engine, whereby the fry may be
destroyed.</P>
<P>1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Eliz,</HI> None shall with any manner of Net, Weele, Butcaining, Kepper,

Mill, Weare, or in any streights, streams, brooks, Rivers, salt or fresh.

&amp;c. The Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> inter alia, shall have full power and Au∣thority
by this Act, to enquire of all offences committed contrary thereunto, by
the Othes of 12 men or more, and to hear and determine all and every the
same, and inflict punishments, and impose fines, accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
5. Then he proceeds to assert the Cities Right, to the conservation of the
Thames, and waters of Medway, by <HI>way of Inquisition,</HI> whereof there were two:
the one taken at <HI>Raynam</HI> in Essex, the other at <HI>Gravesend</HI> in Kent, 9. <HI>Hen.</HI> 5.
before <HI>William Grocer,</HI> then Lord Mayor of <HI>London▪</HI> where it was presented, That
whereas by the ancient Ordinances of <HI>London,</HI> the Mesches of Nets should be
two Inches in the forepart, and one inch in the hinder part; and it being found,
that the offences according to the said Inquisitions are <HI>contra libertates &amp; con∣suetudines
Civitatis,</HI> it was adjudged, that the Nets should be burnt, according
to the ancient custom in that behalf provided.</P>
<P>6. He goes on after, to prove that this Right belongs to the City by <HI>Decrees.</HI>
In 8. <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. The Mayor and Aldermen did exhibit their humble Petition to
the Kings Councel reciting; That, time out of minde, they have had the conser∣vation
and correction of the River of Thames, of all trinks, nets, and other En∣gines
whatsoever in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and Medway placed, and have
used to make a sub-Conservator under them; and complaining, that <HI>Alexander
Bonner,</HI> then sub-Conservator, having discharg'd his duty, in removing Kiddels,
he was ill entreated by the owners, the same owners dwelling in <HI>Erith, Putri∣ferry,
Barking, Woolwich,</HI> and other places in the Counties of Kent, and Essex:
and upon hearing of the matter in <HI>Camera stellata,</HI> they were sound guilty,
and constrained to submit themselves to the Lord Mayor, and ordered to bring
alwayes their Nets unto him, before they should use them. And that the
Kiddles then taken, should be at the disposition of the Lord Mayor; so the
Offendors made their submission accordingly.</P>
<P>7. He proceeds; This right appertains to the City of <HI>London,</HI> by <HI>Letters Pa∣tents,</HI>
which he proved by a grant made by <HI>Edward</HI> the 4th, to the Earl of <HI>Pem∣broke,</HI>
for setting up a Weare in the River of Thames: which grant was revok'd
and annul'd, at the instance of the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen, upon shew∣ing
their right: therefore alledg'd, It was contrary to their ancient Customs.
At which time, the Cities Title to the conservacy of the Thames, and Medway,
was at large set forth, and recited to have bin shewn to the Lord Chancellour,
and to the said Earl and his Councel, which accordingly was allowed.</P>
<P>8. He reinforceth the right of the City by <HI>Proclamations,</HI> whereof one was
made by <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. in 34. of his Raign, wherein it is affirmed, that the Lord
Mayor and his Predecessors, have had by divers grants of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI>
and, by Acts of Parliament, enjoyed alwayes the conservacy of the Thames,
without impediments, or interruption; By which Proclamation, it was com∣manded
that none should resist, deny, or impugne the Lord Mayor, or his De∣puty,
in doing or executing any thing that might conduce to the conservacy of
the River, and of the fish and fry within the same.</P>
<P>9. He produceth <HI>Report;</HI> for in a controversie 'twixt the Lord Admiral, and
the Lord Mayor, for the measuring of Coles, and other things upon the Thames,
it then fell into debate, to whom the Conservacy of the River appertain'd▪
which cause was referred by Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Councel of State, 1597. to the
Atturney General, and Solicitor, who joyntly certified among other things,
<HI>that the Conservacy and care of the River did, and ought to belong to the City of
London,</HI></P>
<P>10. By <HI>quo Warranto,</HI> 'twas proved, that the Conservacy of the Thames be∣longs
to the City, for 3. <HI>Jacob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</HI> a <HI>quo warranto,</HI> was brought against the City in
the Exchequer, to know by what Title she claimed the Conservacy of the Ri∣ver
of Thames, &amp; the waters of Medway: whereupon the City made her Title
good thereunto, by ancient prescription, and otherwise; so judgement was
given in her favour.</P>
<P>11. He goes on afterwards to confirm the right of the City, <HI>by proof of usage;</HI>
in regard the Lord Mayor and Aldermen have time out of minde, made Ordi∣nances
concerning the good Government of the River of Thames, as well for
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
the seasons and manner of fishing beneath <HI>London</HI> Bridge Eastward, upon pain
of penalties, as it appears from time to time, from the Raign of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. and so
downward: the Lord Mayor hath removed Kiddels, Weares, Trinks, and o∣ther
unlawful Engines, and hath reformed the disorders of such as have offen∣ded
besides, in the River of Thames, and inflicted punishment, upon Offendors
accordingly.</P>
<P>The right of the City appeares also by the Writs and Precepts under the teste
of the Lord Mayor, to the Sheriffs of Kent and Essex, for the returning of Ju∣ries
before him, to enquire of Offences done in the River. The same right of
the City, appeares also by Commissions, whereof divers have bin directed to
the Lord Mayor, to put in execution the Acts of Parliament, made for the
Conservancie of the <HI>Thames and Medway,</HI> and to enquire of all offences, made
or done in the said waters, and to punish the Delinquents accor∣dingly.</P>
<P>Lastly, He makes good the Right and Title of the City, by the continual
claim she made thereunto, as appears in those various contests she had with the
Lord Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> wherein after divers debates and bandings, she kept
still above water, and made her Title good; which moved King <HI>James, Anno</HI>
the 3d of his Raign, to put a final determination to the business by the Letters
Patents, he passed unto the City, wherein he saith, that <HI>ad omnem controversi∣am
in hac parte temporibus tam presentibus quàm futuris tollendam, &amp; omne dubi∣um
amovendum,</HI> that to cut off all controversies, as well of the present times,
as of future, and to remove all doubts, he did confirm and ratifie the said right
unto the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Thus was the Title, Prerogative, and right of the City of <HI>London</HI> stoutly, and
strongly asserted by eleven pregnant, and convincing proofs, to the conservati∣on
of her dearly beloved Minion, the River of Thames, both by prescription;
by allowance in <HI>Eire;</HI> by ancient Charters; by Acts of Parliament; by Inquisi∣tions;
by Decrees <HI>coram ipso Rege;</HI> By Letters Patents; by Proclamations; by
Report of the learned Councel; by a <HI>quo Warranto;</HI> And lastly, by ancient u∣sage,
custom, and continual claim.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stow</HI> in his survey of the City of <HI>London,</HI> hath more about this business,
then here is inserted, which made the last King <HI>Charles</HI> the first, to command
Sir <HI>John Coke</HI> his Secretary, to write to Sir <HI>Henry Martin,</HI> Judge of the Ad∣miralty,
to this effect,</P>
<P>That His Majesty understanding, that a second Edition of <HI>Stowes</HI> Sur∣vey
of the City of <HI>London,</HI> was put new to sale, wherein there are some passa∣ges
prejudicial to His Majesties Right in his Admiralty, and derogatory to
the just power belonging thereunto, his Majesty did therefore require him, his
Iudge in that high Court, to examine the said Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, and to cause the said
passages inserted in prejudice of the Admirals Iurisdiction, and in support
of any other pretence against the same, to be left out, or else to prohibite the
publishing, and sale of the said Book, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Henry Martin</HI> having received this Letter, after the Book was printed,
and publiquely sold, all that he could do, was to have Sir <HI>John Cokes</HI> Letter in∣serted
in the last Folio of <HI>Stow,</HI> to stand there for a Cautionary Reserve, and Re∣cord
for the future.</P>
<P>Now, there be many things that concern the incumbency of the Conserva∣tor
of so Noble a River, it being an Office of no small extent.</P>
<P>His first duty is to preserve the currency of the stream, and the banks on
both sides.</P>
<P>Secondly, He must preserve the Fish and Fry within the same, He must
prevent all Encroachments upon the River, and the banks thereof; as also he
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
must enquire of all Flud-gates, Mill-dams, and such like annoyances; and
whether any do hurl in any soyl, dust, or rubbish, or other filth whatsoever to
choak her. But for the strength, and safety of the River, against the invasion of
an enemy, by Block-houses, Forts, Bastions or Castles, and the securing of the
Merchant, and Navigation to and fro, that charge belongs to the Soveraign
Prince, and not to the City.</P>
<P>But indeed, touching the former charge, circumspection and care of the
River of Thames, it is most proper for the City of <HI>London,</HI> who lies perpetually
by her Beds side, and therefore in a fit posture to be watchful of her: for which
vigilance the Thames rewards her abundantly, by bringing her in the Spices
of the South, the Jewels of the East, and Treasure of the West; Insomuch, that
it may be well said▪ this Office of Conservatorship, or superintendency of so
Noble and useful a River, is as a fair flower, or rich Jewel, in the Cap of mainte∣nance.
This famous River, taking all her advantages together, surpassing all other
whatsoever, that pay tribute to the Ocean, if you regard the streightness of her
course, the stilness of her stream, for her proportionable latitude; as also her
length, for she comes sporting along from her first source, above ninescore
miles before she embosomes her self in the Arms of <HI>Neptune.</HI> Add hereunto,
the great store, and variety of Fish she abounds withall; the most delectable,
and fertile soiles, on both sides; And lastly the conveniency of her scitua∣tion
being towards the Center of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And then in her entrance to the Sea, she opens upon <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
having them both in her eye; Besides, she hath another advantagious
property, that to the knowing Native, the entrance into the River is safe and
easie, but difficult and hazardous to strangers, either to come in, or go out; In∣somuch,
that the Thames may be said to be <HI>Londons</HI> best friend, which puts me
in minde of a passage of drollery, that happened in the time of King <HI>James</HI> who
being displeased with the City, because she would not lend him such a sum of
money, and the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen attending him one day, being
somewhat transported, he said, that he would remove his own Court, with all
the Records of the Tower, and the Courts of Westminster-Hall, to another
place, with further expressions of his indignation. The Lord Mayor calmly
heard all and at last answered, Your Majesty hath power to do what you
please, and your City of <HI>London</HI> will obey accordingly; <HI>but she humbly desires,
that when your Majesty shall remove your Courts, you would please to leave the
Thames behind you.</HI></P>

<HI>Thetis</HI> lap, 'tis time now to land, and take a view of her greatest
Bridge, which, if the stupendious Site, and structure thereof be well
considered, may be said to be one of the Wonders of the World:
though, as some think, it hath too many Arches; so that it may be said, <HI>If Lon∣don
Bridge had fewer eyes, it would see far better.</HI></P>
<P>Now as we ferch'd the Thames from her Spring, so we will fetch her Bridge
from its first foundation. At first there was but a Ferry kept in the place where
now the Bridge is built, at length the Ferriman and his Wife deceasing, left
the said Ferry to their only Daughter a Mayden, who with other goods, left
her by her Parents, together with the profits arising from the said Ferry, did
build a holy House for Nuns; in place whereof, the East part of St. <HI>Mary O∣veries</HI>
stands now above the Quire, where she was buried: and unto that House
of Nuns, she bequeathed the over-sight and benefit of the Ferry; But after∣wards,
that House of Nuns being converted into a House of Priests, the Priests
did build a Bridge of Timber, and from time to time, kept the same in good
reparation, till at length, considering the great charges which were bestowed
in the frequent repair of the woodden Bridge, there was at last, by the Contri∣butions
of the Citizens, and others, a Bridge built of Stone.</P>
<P>The Timber Bridge had stood some Ages before; for the Story saith, that
when <HI>Sweyn,</HI> King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> had besieged the City of <HI>London,</HI> both by Wa∣ter
and Land in the year 994. the Citizens manfully defended themselves
under their King <HI>Ethelred;</HI> so that a great number of the Enemies was slain in
Battel, and part of them were drown'd in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> because they
could not recover the Bridge: Add hereunto, that in the year 1016. <HI>Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tus</HI>
the <HI>Dane,</HI> with a great Navy came up to <HI>London,</HI> and on the South of the
Thames caus'd a Trench to be cast, through the which his Ships were tow'd
towards the West side of the Bridge, and then with a deep Trench, and streight
siege, he encompassed the City about.</P>
<P>Moreover, 1052. the Earl <HI>Godwin,</HI> with the like Navy, taking his course up
the River, and finding no resistance on the Bridge, he sail'd up the South side.
Further, 1067. <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror in his Charter to the Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI>
in Westminster, confirmed to the Monks serving God there, a Gate in <HI>London</HI>
call'd <HI>Buttolphs</HI> Gate then, with a Wharf which was at the head of <HI>London</HI>
Bridge.</P>
<P>We read likewise, that <HI>Anno</HI> 1114. in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> 1. the River of
Thames was so dryed up, and the water grew so shallow, that between the
Tower of <HI>London</HI> and the Bridge, not only with Horse, but people might have
passed over a foot.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
<HI>In the year</HI> 1122, Thomas Arden <HI>gave to the Monks at</HI> Bermondsey <HI>the
Church of St.</HI> George <HI>in</HI> Southwark, <HI>and five shillings yearly rent out of the
Land pertaining to</HI> London-<HI>Bridge. There is also a remarkable Charter of</HI>
Hen. 1. <HI>upon Record, to this tenor. Henry</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> to <HI>Ralph Chiche∣ster,</HI>
and all the Ministers of <HI>Sussex,</HI> sendeth greeting; Know ye, I command by my
Kingly authority, that the Manor call'd <HI>Alceston,</HI> which my Father gave with other
Lands to the <HI>Abbey</HI> of <HI>Battle,</HI> be free, and quiet from Shiers and Hundreds, and all
other Customes of earthly servitude, as my Father held the same most freely and qui∣etly,
and namely from the work of <HI>London</HI>-Bridge, the work of the Castle at <HI>Peven∣sey:</HI>
And this I command upon my forfaiture. Witnesse <HI>William de Pontdelarche</HI>

<P>The first year of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> a fire began in the house of one <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lwards</HI> neer
unto <HI>London</HI>-stone, which consum'd East unto <HI>Ludgate,</HI> and West to St. <HI>Erkens∣wald's</HI>
shrine in St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church. The Bridge of Timber upon the River of
<HI>Thames</HI> was also burnt, but afterwards repair'd. Besides in the Reign of the said
King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and of <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. men stood in great numbers upon the Bridge to
see pastimes that were upon the River. In the year 1163, that Bridge was
not only repair'd, but built all of new Timber as before, by <HI>Peter Colechurch</HI>
Priest, and Chaplain.</P>
<P>This serves to shew, that there was a Timber Bridge a long tract of time
over the <HI>Thames,</HI> which was maintain'd partly by the proper Lands thereof,
partly by the Legacies and liberality of divers persons, and partly by tax∣ations
in divers Sheirs, at least 215 years before the Bridge of stone was
erected.</P>
<P>Now, about the year 1176 the stone-Bridge had its first foundation by the
foresaid <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Cole-Church,</HI> near unto the place of the Timber Bridge, but
somewhat more West, for the Chronicle saith, that <HI>Buttolphes</HI> WharF was at the
end of <HI>London</HI>-Bridge; The King not only countenanced, but assisted the great
work, a Cardinal being then here Legate, and <HI>Richard</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbu∣ty,</HI>
gave 1000 Marks towards the Foundation. The course of the River for a
time was turn'd another way about, by a trench cast up for that purpose, begin∣ning
East about <HI>Radriff,</HI> and ending in the West about <HI>Patricksey,</HI> now call'd
<HI>Battersay.</HI> This work to wit, the Arches, Chappel, and the Stone Bridge over the
<HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> having been 33 years in building, was in the year 1209 fini∣shed,
by the worthy Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> viz. <HI>Serle Mercer, William Almane,</HI>
and <HI>Benedict Botewrite,</HI> being principal Masters of that Fabrique: for <HI>Peter
Colechurch</HI> was dead four years before, and was as the principal Benefactor bu∣ried
in the Chappel on the Bridge.</P>
<P>Certain void places were given by King <HI>Iohn</HI> to build upon about <HI>London,</HI> the
profits whereof were assign'd to maintain the Bridge.</P>
<P>A Mason, being Master Workman of the Bridge, builded from the foundati∣on
the large Chappel on that Bridge upon his own charges, which Chappel was
then endow'd with two Priests and four Clerks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> besides Chanteries; After
the finishing of this Chappel, which the first building upon those Arches,
sundry Mansion Houses in tract of time were erected; whereunto many
charitable men gave Lands, Tenements, and sums of money towards the main∣tenance
thereof; All which was sometimes registred, and fairly written in a
Table for posterity, which was put up in the said Chappel, till at last the said
Chappel was turn'd to a dwelling House, and then remov'd to the Bridge∣house:
Now, in <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. time it stands upon Record, that all the payments and
allowances belonging to <HI>London</HI>-Bridge, amounted to above 815 <HI>l.</HI> by which
account made then, may be partly guessed the great Revenues, and incomes of
the said Bridge, and to what improvement, and encrease it may be come unto
by this time.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
But this noble Bridge, as other earthly things, hath suffer'd many disasters
since: for four years after the finishing thereof, in the year 1212, on the 10th, of
<HI>Iuly</HI> at night, the Burrough of <HI>Southwark</HI> on the South side of <HI>Thames,</HI> as also
the Church of our Lady of the Canons there, being on fire, and an exceeding
great multitude of people passing the Bridge, either to extinguish and quench
it, or to behold and gaze upon it, suddenly the North part by blowing of the
South wind, was also set on fire, and the people which were then passing the
Bridge percei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the same, would have return'd, but were stopp'd by the fury of
the fire: and it came to passe as they stayed all in a consternation, and protract∣ed
the time; the other South end of the Bridge, was also set on fire; so that
the people thronging themselves betwixt two raging fires, did nothing else but
expect present death; Whereupon, there came to save them many ships and
vessels into which the multitude so inadvisedly rush'd in, that the ships being
thereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unk they all perished; And it was found that above three thousand
souls perished by this disastrous accident at that time, whose bodies were found
half burnt, besides those who were turn'd to ashes.</P>
<P>Furthermore, in the year 1282, through a great frost and deep snow, five
Arches of <HI>London</HI> Bridge were born down, and destroyed: A little after, <HI>Anno</HI>
1289, the Bridge was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sore decayed for want of reparations, that people were
afrai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to pass thereon and a subsidy was granted towards the amendment there∣of;
Afterwards, Sir <HI>Iohn Britain,</HI> being then <HI>Custos</HI> of <HI>London Anno</HI> 1381, a
great Collection was made by all the Clergy for the repair of <HI>London</HI>-Bridge.</P>
<P>In the year 1381, on St. <HI>Georges</HI> day was a great solemnity of Justs and Tour∣nements
upon <HI>London</HI>-Bridge, between <HI>David</HI> Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
the Lord <HI>Wells</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> whereby one may infer, that the houses were not
there so thick, at that time.</P>
<P>The Tower on <HI>London</HI>-bridge, at the North end of the Draw-bridge (which
was then in a posture to be drawn up) was built <HI>Anno</HI> 1426, in the Majoralty
of <HI>Iohn Rainwell. Anno</HI> 1471, a house call'd the <HI>Common siege</HI> on <HI>London</HI>-Bridge,
tumbled down into the <HI>Thames</HI> by death of diyers persons a little
after.</P>
<P>But in the year sixteen hundred thirty three, there happen'd a most raging
dismal fire upon the North side of <HI>London</HI>-bridge, which by computation con∣sum'd
above the third part of the Buildings thereof; But by the commendable
care of the City, there are other goodly structures rais'd up in some of their
rooms, of a stronger and more stately way of building, and pity it is, that the
work were not compleated there being no object (after the Church of St. <HI>Pauls)</HI>
that can conduce more to the glory and Ornament of this renowned City.</P>
<P>Besides, this Bridge that may be call'd, <HI>the Bridge of the world,</HI> there
are other inferior Bridges, which have still the names of Bridges that
belong to the City of <HI>London,</HI> the first is <HI>Fleet-bridge</HI> in the West,
fenc'd with iron Pikes, on which towards the South there be certain
Lanthorns of Stones, for lights to be placed in Winter Evenings, for com∣modity
of passengers; Under this Bridge runs a water sometimes call'd, the
River <HI>Wells,</HI> but since <HI>Turn-hill brook,</HI> and now <HI>Fleet Dike,</HI> because it runs by the
<HI>Fleet</HI> under ground to the River of <HI>Thames;</HI> this Bridge hath been far greater
in times pass'd, but lessened as the water course hath been narrowed.</P>
<P>Over the sayd River of <HI>Wells</HI> northerly stands <HI>Oldenbridge,</HI> now <HI>Holborn∣bridge,</HI>
so call'd of a boorn that sometimes ran down <HI>Holborn</HI> hill into the Ri∣ver;
this Bridge like <HI>Fleet-bridge</HI>-serves for passage only.</P>
<P>Then comes <HI>Cow-bridge</HI> more Northerly over the same water near unto <HI>Cow∣lane,</HI>
but this Bridge being decayed, another of Timber is made more North to∣wards
<HI>Chicklane.</HI></P>
<P>There are some other small Bridges over the Town-ditch, viz. without <HI>Eald-gate,</HI>
without <HI>Bishopsgat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Mooregate,</HI> the Postern of <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> as also without

<P>ANd now that we are come so near the famous and great <HI>Tower</HI> Pala∣tine,
or Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adel of <HI>London;</HI> we will try whether we can get in thi∣ther,
without paying fees, and take a view thereof as briefly as we
can, it being an ill-favoured, and tedious thing to stay there long.</P>
<P>I know it is the current vulgar opinion, that <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> the first <HI>Conque∣rour,</HI>
or rather indeed <HI>Discoverer</HI> of <HI>Britain,</HI> was the Original Founder thereof,
but there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery litle probability of truth in that for two Reasons; The first is,
the little stay he made here, during which he had other things to think on.
The second is, that he himself who is so exact in his relations, specially if they
conduce to his honour; nor any other <HI>Roman</HI> Author, makes any mention of
of such a work, or Fabrique; Therefore, that opinion which approacheth truth
the neerest, is, that <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Normandy</HI> the <HI>Conqueror,</HI> was the first tracer and
erector of the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> as <HI>Edmond de Hadenham,</HI> an old English Anti∣quary
affirms; The first part that was built, was the great square and White
Tower, (though black to some) which was about the year 1078, where∣of
<HI>Gundulph</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI> was principal Superviser and Surveyer, who
was log'd then in the house of <HI>Edmere</HI> a Burgesse of <HI>London,</HI> as it stands upon La∣tine
Record in the forenamed Author.</P>
<P>Now it is to be considered, that at first the wall of the City was in many pla∣ces
furnish'd with sundry Bastions and Turrets in due distance one from the
other, and divers stood on the waters side, where some of the said Wall extended
at first, but the <HI>Thames</HI> with her ebbings and flowings, did as it were corrode,
and subver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those Buildings on the South side; Wherefore the <HI>Conqueror</HI>
(for then the Art of fortification was come to a greater perfection) for defence
of the City and River, pitch'd upon that place as most convenient, to erect a
Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wark in the East part of the Wall. The White square Tower (as was formerly
said) was first erected, and finished in the <HI>Conquerors</HI> time, but stood naked and
single without other Buildings a good while: and the story <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, that in <HI>William
Rufus</HI> time, it was by the injury of the Heavens, and violence of tempest sore
shaken, and some part tumbled down, which was repair'd by the said <HI>Rufus</HI>
and <HI>Henry</HI> the first, who also caused a Castle to be built under the said
White Tower, on the South side towards the <HI>Thames,</HI> and he surrounded that
also with a strong Wall; Now, <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Huntindon</HI> relates, that <HI>VVill. Rufus</HI>
challeng'd the inve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iture of Prelates, and pill'd the people pitifully, to spend
the treasure about the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and the great Hall at <HI>VVestminster,</HI>
whereof he was Founder. The first Keeper of the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI> was call'd
<HI>Constable, Ostowerus. Acolinillus, Otho,</HI> and <HI>Geoffrey Magnaville,</HI> were the first
four <HI>Constables</HI> of the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI> by succession, all which held a portion
of Land that appertain'd to the Priory of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> near <HI>Algate,</HI> viz. <HI>East
Smithfield,</HI> as belonging to that Office, making thereof a Vineyard; and would
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
would not part with it till the second year of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> when by judgment
of the Court, it was restored to the Church. The foresaid <HI>Geoffery Magnaville,</HI>
was at one time <HI>Constable</HI> of the <HI>Tower, Sherif</HI> of <HI>London, Middlesex, Essex▪ &amp; Hart∣fordshire,</HI>
as the Chronicles relate; He also fortified the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI> against
King <HI>Stephen,</HI> but the King took him at last at St. <HI>Albanes,</HI> and would not free
him till he had surrendred the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> with the Castles of <HI>VValden</HI> and
<HI>Plashey</HI> in <HI>Essex. Richard de Lucie</HI> was <HI>Anno 1155 Constable</HI> of the <HI>Tower</HI> of

<P>About the beginning of the Raign of <HI>Richard</HI> the first, <HI>William Longshank</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> and Chancellour of <HI>England,</HI> for some dissentions 'twixt him, and
<HI>John</HI> the Kings Brother, who was in Rebellion, enclos'd the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI>
with an outward Wall of stone embattail'd, and also caused a deep ditch to be
cast about the same, and thought to have environ'd it with the River of
<HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Lion Tower</HI> was built by <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth &amp; <HI>Frederick</HI> the Emperor, ha∣ving
sent for a present three <HI>Leopards:</HI> they were first kept at <HI>Woodstock</HI> (which
was the first Park of <HI>England</HI> seven miles about; to the destruction of some
Churches, and Chappels adjacent by <HI>Henry</HI> the third) but afterwards, all such
wild Beasts, as <HI>Lions</HI> (which are call'd the Beasts of the Royall Prerogative) to∣gether
with <HI>Leopards, Linxes,</HI> and <HI>Propentines,</HI> have been kept in that part of the
<HI>Tower,</HI> which is called <HI>Lions Tower;</HI> And we read, that <HI>Edward</HI> the 2d. com∣manded
the Sheriff of <HI>London,</HI> to pay 6d. <HI>per diem,</HI> to the Keeper o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Lions</HI> and
<HI>Leopards,</HI> for their sustenance; and three half pence a day for the Keeper's diet,
out of the Fee-farm of the City. In former times, there were persons of high
quality that kept these Beasts (whereof the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> was one) and they
had a Pension from the Crown belonging to the Office. Mr. <HI>Robert Gill</HI> a very
worthy Gentleman hath the place now, and hath had it many years, No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was
the <HI>Tower</HI> ever better furnish'd with Lions than it is now, there being six in all,
young and old. <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth fortified the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and enclosed
with Brick a certain enclosure of ground taken from <HI>Tower-hill</HI> Westward, now
call'd the <HI>Bullwark.</HI> His Officers also set up upon the said Hill a Gallowes, and
a Scaffold, for the execution of offendors, whereupon the Lord Mayor com∣plaining
to the King, all the answer he had, was, that it was not done to the
derogation of the City.</P>
<P>In the year 1216, the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI> was delivered to <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> by
the Barons of <HI>England,</HI> who banded against the King; <HI>Anno</HI> 1222. the Citi∣zens
of <HI>London,</HI> having made an uprore against the Abbot of <HI>Westminster, Huber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
de Burgh</HI> chief Justice of <HI>England</HI> came to the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and summoned
before him the Mayor and Aldermen: of whom he enquired, and demanded
the principal Authors of that Insurrection. Among whom one <HI>Constantine
Fitzaeluphe</HI> confess'd that he was the man, saying undauntedly that he was the
man, and that he had done much lesse than he had thought to have done;
Whereupon the Justice passed him over to <HI>Fulke de Brent,</HI> who with a band
of arm'd men, brought him to the Gallowes where he was executed. <HI>Anno
1244. Griffeth</HI> the eldest Son to <HI>Luellin</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> being kept prisoner in
the <HI>Tower,</HI> devised means to escape, and having made a Line of the Sheets and
Hangings, he put himself down from the top of the Tower, but in the sliding,
the weight of his Body, he being a corpulent man, brake the rope with his
neck together.</P>
<P>King <HI>Hen.</HI> the 3d. imprisoned the Sheriffs of <HI>London, Anno</HI> 1253. for the escape
of a prisoner out of <HI>Newgate.</HI> The same <HI>Henry</HI> with his Queen, to secure himself
from rebelling Barons, kept his Court at the <HI>Tower,</HI> &amp; sent for the Lords to hold
a Parliament; and the next year his Queen passing through <HI>London</HI>-Bridge, the
Londoners did outrage her as she pass'd hurling stones and dirt at her, in so
much that she was forc'd to return; hereupon the Mayor, Aldermen, and She∣riffs,
<PB N="25" REF="22"/>
were sent to divers Prisons, and a <HI>Custos</HI> was set over the City for the time'
viz. <HI>Othon</HI> Constable of the Tower, until submission had bin made, and other
satisfaction given.</P>
<P>It is upon Record, that <HI>Edw.</HI> 2. allowed a Knight 2d. <HI>per diem,</HI> and a Squire
a peny, for their Diet, as long as they were prisoners in the Tower upon his
Command: <HI>Roger Mortimer</HI> being prisoner in the Tower, gave his Watch∣men
a sleeping potion, and so escaped; but afterwards, he was arraigned and
condemned by his Peers, without personal appearance, and so executed at the
Elmes, where he hung two dayes.</P>
<P>The Londoners in the year 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. seized upon the Tower, wresting the keys
out of the Constables hands, they freed all the Prisoners, and kept it in their
hands for the use of Queen <HI>Isabel,</HI> and her Son <HI>Edward,</HI> both Tower and
City.</P>
<P>The first gold that was coin'd in the Tower, was in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the
third, and the peeces were call'd Florences, of the value of <HI>6s. 8d; Perceval
de post</HI> being Master of the Mint at that time. All great sums before, were used
to be payd by the weight, as so many pounds or marks of silver, or so many
pounds or marks of gold; but they bore no stamp, the lesser payments were
in Starlings, which was the only coin then current, and stamp'd, which were
pence so call'd. And they had their antiquity no further, then from the raign
of King <HI>Henry</HI> the second. Nevertheless, the Saxon coines before the Con∣quest,
were pence of fine silver, somewhat weightier, and better then the latter
starlings, and the probablest Reason that is given, why it was starling money,
was, because in the ring or border of the peny, there was a Starre stamp∣ed.</P>
<P>But to return to the Tower of <HI>London:</HI> In the year 1360. <HI>Iohn</HI> the French
King being Prisoner in the Tower, King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, being newly retur∣ned
victoriously from <HI>France,</HI> the first thing he did, was to visit his Prisoner
whose ransome was assessed afterwards at three millions of Florences or No∣bles;
whereupon he was brought honourably to the Sea side: <HI>Anno</HI> 1387.
King <HI>Richard</HI> kept his Christmas in the Tower, and the year after was clapt
up Prisoner there.</P>
<P>In the year 1458. there were Justs and Tournements in the Tower, wherein
the chief Actor was the Duke of <HI>Somerset; Anno 1465, Henry</HI> the sixth, was
brought Prisoner to the Tower, where he remained many years, of whom was
given this Character, that <HI>he was a good King, but born in an ill time:</HI> The Mayor
of <HI>London</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Lee,</HI> and the Aldermen, freed the said King <HI>Henry</HI> once
from his imprisonment; but being sent thither again, he was pittifully mur∣thered.
<HI>Anno</HI> 1478. The Duke of <HI>Clarence</HI> was drowned in a But of <HI>Malmsey</HI>

<P><HI>Iohn</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford, Anno</HI> 1485. was made Constable of the Tower, and he

<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Wife to <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th, died in the Tower, <HI>Anno</HI> 1502. in

others Sir <HI>Thomas More,</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> was clap'd there
close Prisoner: and at last they took away from him all his Books, so he did
shut up all his windows, and liv'd afterwards in obscurity, and being asked
Why, he answered, <HI>'Tis time to shut up shop, when the Ware is all gone:</HI> At his first
entrance to the Tower, the Gentleman Porter, ask'd for his fee, which is the
upper Garment, whereupon Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> pull'd off his Cap to give him, but that
not suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing, he pull'd out a handful of Angels, end gave him a good many, a
Knight that was in his Company telling him, that he was glad to see him so full
of Angels; yes, answered he, <HI>I love to carry my friends alwayes about
me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The young Lady</HI> Iane, <HI>was beheaded there not long after, and upon the Scaf∣fold
she made a most ingenious Speech, and full of pity,</HI> That she came thither,
to serve for an example to posterity, that innocence cannot be any protection against
greatness; And that she was come thither, not for aspiring to a Crown, but for not
refusing one, when it was offered Her.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was brought up many years in that School of affliction, but
afterwards she may be said to have gone from the Scaffold to the Throne; For
the truth is, that the Scaffold had made an end of her, had not King <HI>Philip</HI>
her Brother in Law, strongly interceded for her. In her dayes, <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of
<HI>Essex</HI> lost his head in the Tower, which he might have kept on many years
longer, had he not bin betrayed by the Lady <HI>Walsingham;</HI> to whom after the
sentence of condemnation, he sent a Ring, which the Queen had given him as
a token that she would stick to him in any danger: the Lady delivered not this
Ring, and being a little after upon her Death-bed she desired to speak with the
Queen, and having disburthened a great weight which lay upon her Consci∣ence
for that act, the Queen flung away in a fury, and never enjoyed her self
perfectly after that time, but she would break out often into passion, and
wring her hands, crying▪ O <HI>Essex-Essex.</HI> And this Earl was the last, who was
executed within the walls of the Tower.</P>
<P>In King <HI>Iames's</HI> time, for 22 years, there was no blood spilt, in the Tower,
or upon Tower-hill, only Sir <HI>Gervase Elwayes</HI> was hanged there, when he was
Lieutenant: and one remarkable passage there was in his Speech upon the Lad∣der,
that being in the low Countries, and much addicted to gaming, he made
a vow, that if ever he played more above such a value, he might be hanged; but
he did violate the Oath, and so the just Judgement of Heaven did fall upon
him, accordingly as he said.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Castlehaven</HI> was brought from the Tower to be executed for hor∣rid
kinds of incontinencies in <HI>Charles</HI> the first time; Afterwards, in the raign
of the <HI>long Parliament,</HI> and ever since, the Tower of <HI>London</HI> hath had more
number of Prisoners, then it had in the compasse of a hundred years be∣fore.</P>
<P>This stately Tower of <HI>London,</HI> serves not only for a Gaol to detain prisoners,
but for many other uses, It is a strong Fort, or Cittadel, which secures both
City and River, It serves not only to defend, but to command either, upon oc∣casion;
It serves as a royal Randezvouz for Assemblies and Treaties; It is the
Treasury for the Jewels and Ornaments of the Crown; The great Archive
which conserves all the old Records of the Courts of Justice at <HI>Westminster;</HI> It
is the place for the Royal Mint, and Coynage of Gold and Silver; It is the chief
Magazin and Armory, or Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enal of the whole Land, for Martial Engines, and
Provision. There only, is the <HI>Brake</HI> or <HI>Rack,</HI> usually call'd the <HI>Duke of Exceters
Daughter</HI> because he was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e first Inventer of it.</P>
<P>And lastly, It is a great Ornament, by the situation of it, both to the Ri∣ver
and City.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="23"/>
The City of <HI>London</HI> hath divers other inferior Towers, as that on the North
of the great Bridge. At the South end over the Gate, there is also another
Tower over <HI>London-Bridge,</HI> which hath suffered many accidents of firing, and
otherwise, and was still made up by the care and charge of the City, specially
one time when it was under bastard <HI>Fawconbridge,</HI> burnt by the Marriners, and
Saylers of <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>The Antiquaries speak of two Castles that were in the West part of <HI>London,</HI>
one call'd the Castle of <HI>Monfiquet,</HI> which was built by a Baron of that name,
who came over with the Conqueror, which was afterwards demolished, and
the <HI>Black Fryers</HI> risen up out of the ruines of it; The second Castle is <HI>Baynards
Castle,</HI> by <HI>Pauls</HI> Wharf, built also by one <HI>Baynard,</HI> who came over with the
Conqueror: who being ennobled, the honour of <HI>Baynards</HI> Castle succeeded
from Father to Son, a long time, till it came to Sir <HI>Robert Fitzwater,</HI> a valiant
Cavalier: who being fallen into the displeasure of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> in the Barons
Warres, was banished, and <HI>Baynards</HI> Castle destroyed; But afterwards, being
rest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red to the Kings favour, by an exployt he did in <HI>France,</HI> he was re-invested
in all his Livings, and so repair'd <HI>Baynards</HI> Castle again: Moreover, he was
made chief <HI>Banner-bearer</HI> of the City of <HI>London▪</HI> whereof he had a Charter,
which ran to this sense, <Q>That he said, <HI>Robert Fitzwater,</HI> and his Heirs, ought
to be, and are chief <HI>Bannerers</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> in fee for the Chastilary, which he
and his Ancestors had from <HI>Baynards</HI> Castle, and the said City. In time of War
the said <HI>Robert</HI> and his Heires, ought to serve the City as followeth. The said
<HI>Robert</HI> (he being the twentieth man of Armes himself) ought to come on
Horseback, covered with Cloth or Armor, under the great West door of St.
<HI>Paul,</HI> with his Banner displayed before him; and when he is come mounted
to that door, and apparreld, as before is said, The Maior (with the Aldermen
and Sheriffs) in their Arms, shall come out of the Church of St. <HI>Paul,</HI>
unto the said West door, the Maior bearing a Banner in his hand, all on foot,
which Banner shall be <HI>Gules,</HI> the Image of St. <HI>Paul</HI> Gold, the face, hands, feet,
and Sword Argent; And as soon as the said <HI>Robert</HI> shall see the Maior, Alder∣men
and Sheriffs, come on foot out of the Church, armed with such a Banner,
he shall alight off his Horse, and salute the Maior, and say to him, Sir Maior,
I am come to do my service which I owe to the City: whereunto the Maior,
and Aldermen shall answer, We give to you, as to our Bannerer of fee in this
City, the Banner of this City, to beare, and govern to the honour and profit
of this City to your power: And the said <HI>Robert</HI> and his Heires, shall receive
the said Banner in his hands, and shall go on foot out of the Gate, with the
Banner in his hands, and the Maior, Aldermen, and Sheriffs, shall follow to
the door, and shall bring a Horse to the said Bannerer, worth twenty pounds,
which Horse shall be sadled with a saddle of the Arms of the said Bannerer,
and shall be covered with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indalls of the said Arms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Moreover, they shall present unto him, twenty pounds Starling money, and
deliver it to the Chamberlain of the said Bannerer, for his expences that day.
Then the said Bannerer shall mount on Horseback, with the Banner in his
hand, and as soon as he is up, he shall say to the Lord Maior, that he cause a
Marshal to be chosen for the Host, one of the City; which Marshal being nam'd,
the said Bannerer shall command the Maior and Burgesses of the City, to
warn the Commons to assemble, and they shall all go under the Banner of St.
<HI>Paul;</HI> and the said Bannerer shall bear it himself unto <HI>Ealdgate;</HI> and there the
said Bannerer and the Maior, shall deliver the said Banner from thence, to
whom they shall assent and think good; And in case they make any issue out
of the City, then the said Bannerer ought to choose two out of every Ward,
the most sage Personages, to foresee and look to the safe keeping of the City,
after they be gone forth; And this Councel shall be taken in the priory of the
holy <HI>Trinity,</HI> near unto <HI>Aldgate;</HI> And also before every Town or Castle, they
<PB N="28" REF="24"/>
shall besiege, if the siege continue a whole year, the said Bannerer shall
have for every siege one hundred shillings, and no more of the Comminalty
of London.</Q></P>
<P>These be the Rights that the said <HI>Bannerer</HI> shall have in time of War; But the
Rights that belong unto the said Bannerer Sir <HI>Rob▪ Fitzwater</HI> in time of peace are
these, that is to say, <Q>The said <HI>Robert</HI> hath a Soke or Ward in the City, that is to
say, a Wall of the Canonry of St. <HI>Paul</HI> unto the Thames, &amp; so to the side of the
Mill, which is in the water that cometh from <HI>Fleet</HI> bridge, &amp; so goeth by Lon∣don
walls betwixt the Fryars Preachers &amp; Ludgate, &amp; so returneth back by the
house of the said Fryrs, unto the said Walls, of the said Canonry of St. <HI>Pauls,
viz.</HI> all the Parish of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> which is in the gift of his Ancestors by the
said Signority; And so the said <HI>Robert</HI> hath appendant unto the said Soke, all
these things under-written, &amp; if any of the Sokemanry be impleaded in <HI>Guild∣hall,</HI>
of any thing that toucheth not the Body of the Lord Mayor, or the She∣riffs
for the time being, it is not lawful for the Sokeman of the Sokmanry
of the said <HI>Robert</HI> to demand a Court of the said <HI>Robert;</HI> And the Mayor and
the Citizens of London ought to grant him a Court, and in his Court he
ought to bring his Judgments as it is assented and agreed upon in the <HI>Guild∣hall,</HI>
that shall be given him. If any therefore be taken in his Sokemanry, he
ought to have his stocks and imprisonment in his Soke, and he shall be brought
thence to the <HI>Guild-hall</HI> before the Mayor, and there they shall provide him
his judgement that ought to be given of him; but his judgement shall not be
publish'd till he come unto the Court of the said <HI>Robert,</HI> and in his Liberty.
And the Judgement shall be such, that if he have deserved death for Treason,
he is to be tied to a Post in the <HI>Thames</HI> at a good Wharf, where Boats are faste∣ned,
two ebbings and two flowings of the water. And if he be condemn'd
for a common thief, he ought to be led to the <HI>Elmes,</HI> and there suffer
his judgement as other thieves; So the said <HI>Robert</HI> and his Heirs hath the ho∣nour,
that he holdeth a great Franchise within the City, that the Mayor of
the City, and the Cittizens are bound to do him of Right, <HI>viz.</HI> that when the
Mayor will hold a great Councel, he ought to call the said <HI>Robert</HI> and his
Heir to be with him in the Councel of the said City; and the said <HI>Robert</HI>
ought to be sworn of the Councell of the said City, against all people; saving
the King, and his Heirs. And when the said <HI>Robert</HI> comes to the <HI>Hustings</HI> in
the <HI>Guild-hall</HI> of the said City, the Mayor or his Livetenant, ought to rise
and set him down to sit neer him; and so long as he is in the Guild-hall, all
the judgements ought to be given by his mouth, according to the Records of
the Recorders of the said Guildhall; And so many Waifes as come while he
he is there, he ought to give them to the Bayliffs of the said Town, or
to whom he will by the Councel of the City.</Q></P>
<P>These are the ancient Franchises that belong to the <HI>Bannerer</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> as they
stand upon ancient authentick Records; But when this honor fell from the
<HI>Fitzwaters,</HI> and from <HI>Baynards</HI> Castle, 'tis incertain; Now, that Castle fell after∣wards
to the Earl of <HI>March,</HI> who was Crown'd there by the Title of <HI>Edward</HI>
the fourth, to whom this City stuck very close; But in the seventh year of King
<HI>Edward</HI>'s Reign, many of the greatest men of <HI>London</HI> were attach'd for Treason,
with divers Aldermen, whereof though they were acquitted, yet they did
forfeit their goods to the value of 40000 marks; among whom Sir <HI>Thomas Coke,</HI>
Sir <HI>Iohn Plummer,</HI> and <HI>Humfrey Howard,</HI> were of the number; And the said
<HI>Coke</HI> Lord Mayor a little before was committed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> with one <HI>Hawkins;</HI>
nor could <HI>Coke</HI> be acquitted until he had paied 8000 Marks to the King.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the seventh rode in Majesty through the City with all the Knights of
St. <HI>George,</HI> from the <HI>Tower</HI> to St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, where they heard Vespers, and
so the King lodg'd that night at <HI>Baynards</HI> Castle, which he had newly repair'd be∣fore.
Queen <HI>Mary</HI> was also proclaim'd there, notwithstanding that the Lady
<PB N="29" REF="24"/>
<HI>Jane</HI> had been proclaim'd a little before. There was also another Tower or
Castle, near adioyning unto <HI>Baynards</HI> Castle, which was call'd <HI>Legates Inne,</HI>
but now there is no trace of it le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</P>
<P>There was also another Castle call'd the Tower of <HI>Monfiquet</HI> (spoken of a lit∣tle
before) upon the River of Thames more Westward, where afterwards a
Monastery of Fryars was erected, call'd to this day the <HI>Black fryars;</HI> first
built by <HI>Kelwarby,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to whom the Mayor of <HI>London,</HI>
gave two Lanes or wayes adjoyning to <HI>Baynards</HI> Castle; There was also ano∣ther
<HI>Tower</HI> stood there, above 300 years, which was demolished by <HI>Iohn Sha</HI>
Lord Mayor of <HI>London Anno</HI> 1502, the King giving leave to do it.</P>
<P>There was another Tower or Castle, that stood in the same place that <HI>Bride-well</HI>
now stands; which being demolished, yet notwithstanding, there was a
Royal Palace stood still where the Kings of <HI>England</HI> kept their Courts, and
call'd Parliaments: and among others, it stands upon good Record, that King
<HI>Iohn</HI> summoned a Parliament thither, where he exacted of the Clergy in a Par∣liament
held at Saint <HI>Brides</HI> in <HI>London</HI> 100000 Marks; and besides this, the
white Monks were compelled to cancel their Priviledges, and pay the King
40000 Marks; This House of Saint <HI>Brides</HI> of later time being left, and not used
or inhabited, fell to ruine, yet the Platform still remained among the filth and
rubbish, together with a fair Well. A great part of the House on the West side,
was given to the Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> whence <HI>Salisbury</HI> Court derives its name
to this day; The other part towards the East remain'd wast, until <HI>Henry</HI> the
8th, did build a stately Palace there in a very short time, and call'd it <HI>Bridewel,</HI>
which he did for the entertainment of his Nephew <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth Emperour
and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who came hither <HI>Anno</HI> 1522, and was there entertain'd
in a Princely and Magnificent manner.</P>
<P>There was another Tower call'd the <HI>Tower Royal</HI> in the Parish of Saint <HI>Mi∣chael
de Pater noster,</HI> where King <HI>Stephen</HI> was us'd to keep his Court, which
was call'd afterwards the <HI>Queens Wardrobe; Barbican</HI> was also another Tower,
Besides, there was an ancient Tower, in <HI>Bucklersbury,</HI> called <HI>Sernes Tower,</HI> and
the story saith, that <HI>Edward</HI> the third kept his Court there, appointing his
exchange of moneys to be also there kept, which he gave afterwards to his free
Chappel of St. <HI>Stephen</HI> in <HI>VVestminster,</HI> now call'd <HI>Henry</HI> the sevenths Chappel,
who spent 14000 ls. in the building of it, and about the same time a great ship
was built which cost just as much.</P>

<HEAD>Of the publick places of Sciences and Litera∣ture
which London hath.</HEAD>
<P>IT is observed, that the English Nation hath bin alwaies extraordinarily
addicted to Literature, and to the love of Knowledge: which among
other instances appears; in that, of old times, there were three principal
Churches in <HI>London</HI> which had famous Schools, wherein there were profes∣sors
&amp; Doctors, which were famous for their know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edge in Philosophy and the
Mathematicks; The three Churches which had these Schools by Priviledges,
were the Cathedral Church of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> for by General Councel held in the
year 1176 at Rome in the Patriarchy of Saint <HI>Lateran,</HI> it was decreed, that eve∣ry
Cathedral Church should have a School-master to teach poor Schollers, and
others. The second, was St. <HI>Peters</HI> in <HI>Westminster,</HI> whereof <HI>Ingulphus</HI> Abbot of
<HI>Crowland</HI> in the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror writes thus; <HI>I</HI> Ingulphus <HI>an
humble servant of God, born of English Parents in the most beautiful City of</HI> Lon∣don,
<HI>for to attain to Learning, was first put to</HI> Westminster, <HI>and after to study a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
Oxford, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The third School, seemes to have bin in the Monastery of St. Savl∣our
in <HI>Bermondsey</HI> at <HI>Southwark.</HI></P>
<P>There were other Schools built afterwards, as that of St <HI>Iohn</HI> by <HI>Smithfield,</HI>
and that of Saint <HI>Bartholmew,</HI> that of Saint <HI>Mary Overies,</HI> and that of the holy
<HI>Trinity</HI> by <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> with divers others; But touching Philosophy and other
Sciences, in regard that the Colledges in <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> did so much en∣crease;
the former meetings in <HI>London,</HI> and di putes in Philosophy, that were
used to be, did discontinue; Only of late years, that noble <HI>Maecenas</HI> and Patri∣ot,
Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham,</HI> did erect to his eternal honour a <HI>Colledge</HI> for all the
Sciences, in <HI>Bishopsgate</HI>-street, as an attendant to his <HI>Royall Exchange.</HI></P>
<P>The Chronicles teach us, that <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth having suppressed the <HI>Priori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
Aliens,</HI> whereof there were some about <HI>London,</HI> namely, our Lady of <HI>Rounc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>val</HI>
by <HI>Charing crosse,</HI> one other Hospital in <HI>Oldborn,</HI> now <HI>Holborn,</HI> another without

long since out of memory, only that of <HI>Rouncival</HI> continued till the Reign of
<HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, being converted to a brotherhood; But <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth ap∣pointed
by Patent, that there should be in <HI>London</HI> more Grammar Schooles
erected, to wit, one in St <HI>Andrews</HI> in <HI>Holborn,</HI> another in <HI>Alhallows</HI> the great,
another in St <HI>Peters</HI> on <HI>Cornhil,</HI> and another in the Hospital of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of
<HI>Acon</HI> in West cheap▪ The Free-school of <HI>Pauls</HI> was built of an old ruined
house in ample manner, and richly endowed <HI>Anno</HI> 1512, by Doctor <HI>Colet</HI> Dean
of <HI>Pauls,</HI> for 153 poor mens children: for which there was a chief Master, an
Usher, and Chaplain ordained.</P>
<P>Moreover, in the year 1553, after the erection of <HI>Christs Hospital,</HI> which risse
out of the ruins of the <HI>Grey Fryers</HI> that stood there, a great number of poor chil∣dren
were taken in, and a fair School appointed at the charge of the City, though
<HI>Edward</HI> the sixth beat the name of Patron.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1561 the <HI>Marchant Taylors</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> founded one notable School,
in the Parish of St. <HI>Lawrence Poultney.</HI> The house was sometimes the Duke of
<HI>Buckinghams</HI> called, <HI>the Mannor of the Rose,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Richard Hills</HI> Master
of the company, did purchase for 500 l. and bestowed it for a free School.</P>
<P>There was an old Custome in <HI>London,</HI> that the School-Masters should meet
on festival daies, and their Schollers should dispute in Logick, as well as Gram∣mer
Questions, and Principles, and the most common randezvouz, was Saint
<HI>Bartholmews</HI> in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> being a priory, where upon a bank boorded under
<PB N="31" REF="25"/>
a tree, they used to meet, and the best Schollers were rewarded with Bows and
Arrows of silver, which they carried away as prizes: but that laudable custome
is grown obsole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and quite discontinued.</P>
<P>A great emulation there was 'twixt <HI>Pauls</HI> Schollers, and those of St. <HI>Antho∣nies;</HI>
the Schollers of <HI>Pauls</HI> would taunt, and term them, St. <HI>Anthonies Piggs;</HI>
and they would call St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Schollers, <HI>Pigeons of Pauls,</HI> and many feuds hap∣pen'd
amongst them in the open streets: but St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> School decaying, the
quarrel also ceas'd.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1582, a publick Lecture of <HI>Chirurgery</HI> was founded, to be read in the
Colledge of Physitians in <HI>Knight-rider-street</HI> twice every week; The Founder
thereof was, the honourable Baron the Lord <HI>Lumley,</HI> and <HI>Richard Chadwel</HI> Do∣ctor
of Physick; and Doctor <HI>Foster</HI> was the first Reader thereof.</P>
<P>A Mathematical Lecture was also founded about the same time, to be read
in a fair ancient Chappel, built by <HI>Simon Eyre</HI> within <HI>Leaden-hall;</HI> But this
Chappel, being employ'd afterwards for stowage of goods taken out of a Spanish
Carack, the said Lecture ceas'd there, and was used to be read in Mr. <HI>Tho. Smiths</HI>
house in Grass-street, 1184.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1579 Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham</HI> (Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Royal Marchant or A∣gent,
spoken of before) gave the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> with all the buildings there∣unto
appertaining, <HI>viz.</HI> the one moity to the Mayor and Comminalty of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and their Successors, upon trust that they perform as shall be declared; and
the other moity to the Mercers on the same confidence; The Maior &amp; Aldermen
are to find four to read Lectures of Divinity, Astronomy, Musick, and Geome∣try
within that dwelling in <HI>Bishopsgate-street,</HI> and to bestow the sum of 200l.
<HI>viz. 50l. per annum</HI> to every Reader. The Mercers also are to find three Readers
in the same place, that is, The <HI>Civil Law, Physick</HI> and <HI>Rhetorick,</HI> and every
Reader was to have 50 l. a year stipen'd, which great gift was confirm'd after∣wards
by Act of Parliament, and so to continue for ever.</P>
<P>These Lectures are to be read every day in the week in Term time (Sundays
excepted) in the Latine Tongue in the morning, and the same in English in the
same dayes afternoon, only the Musick Lecture, whereof Doctor <HI>Bull</HI> was the
first Lecturers was to be read only in English.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is in and about the City of London, a whole University, as
it were of Students, Practisers, or Pleaders, and Judges of the Lawes of England,
not living of common Salaries, as is used in other Academies; but of their
private maintenance, as being supported, by their own means or practise, or ex∣hibition
from their friends; In so much that most of them are Sons &amp; youn∣ger
Brothers to wealthy Parents, where, besides the knowledge of the Laws,
they learn all other civilities and exercises besides.</P>
<P>Of these Nurseries or Societies there are fourteen, whereof nine do stand
within the Liberties of the City, and five without; Those that stand within
the Liberties are, <HI>Sargeants Inne</HI> in <HI>Fleet-street, Sargeants Inne</HI> in <HI>Chancery Lane,</HI>
the two <HI>Temples,</HI> which are called, <HI>Inns of Court;</HI> The other are, <HI>Cliffords Inne,
Thavies Inne</HI> in <HI>Holborn, Furnevals Inne, Barnards Inne,</HI> and <HI>Staples Inne,</HI> which
are termd Inns of <HI>Chancery.</HI></P>
<P>Without the Liberties, there is <HI>Grayes Inne</HI> in <HI>Holburn, Lincolns Inne,</HI> (which
are Inns of Court) <HI>Clements Inne, New Inne,</HI> and <HI>Lions Inne,</HI> which are houses
of Chancery. In former time, there was in <HI>Scroops</HI> Court in <HI>Holborn</HI> an Inne of
Sargeants also; There was likewise where <HI>Somerset</HI> House now stands <HI>Chesters
Inne</HI> or <HI>Strand Inne,</HI> in the liberty of the Dutchy of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> which was pull'd
down with many other Buildings, to make room for <HI>Somerset</HI> House, who had
also his materials from St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which some held to be no better
than Sacr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>edge; and therefore that fatal death, to be beheaded, befell the Duke
of <HI>Somerset,</HI> who with his Councel were, it seems, so infatuated, that they for∣got
<PB N="32" REF="26"/>
to call for his Clergy, whereby, by the Lawes of England, he might have bin
saved. Justice <HI>Fortescue</HI> makes mention also of a tenth house of <HI>Chancery,</HI> but he
names not the place. The choisest, gentliest &amp; most ingenious wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Land,
are founds among these Students of the Inns of Court▪ having cōmonly bin gra∣duates
before, in one of the Universities; But the Inns of Chancery being as it
were Provinces subjected severally to the Inns of Court be chiefly made up of
Attorneys, Sollicitors, and Clerks that follow the Courts of <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall;
yet many of them remove to one of the great Inns of Court, where continuing
seven years, and frequenting Readings, Mootings, Boltings, and other
learned Exercises, they improve themselves in the knowledge of the Lawes:
they are then by the consent of the <HI>Benchers,</HI> who are most commonly of the
grave and learned sort selected, &amp; call'd to the degree of <HI>Utter Barristers,</HI> and
so enabled to be Practitioners in the Law, both in their Chamber, and at the
Barre in open Court▪ Of these after they be call'd to a further step of preferment,
2. were used to be chosen every year to be Readers, who make two Readings eve∣ry
year out of some choise hard points in the Law, one in <HI>Lent,</HI> the other in <HI>Au∣gust.</HI>
Out of these Benchers and Readers, Sergeants at Law are made, and of
them the Judges, unlesse it be that some by special favour of the Prince are cho∣sen
otherwise; But being made Sergeants, they leave the Inns of Court and re∣move
to one of the Sergeants Inns; where they only, and the reverend Judges
are admitted. Touching the two Temples, they are discoursed of here in ano∣ther
place; But concerning <HI>Grayes Inne</HI> and <HI>Lincolns Inne,</HI> they took their
denominations from two noble Lords, who had formerly Palaces in those
places where those two Innes now stand; The one is singular, for a curious
Chappel it hath; the other for choise delicate Walks, high and low, with a large
delightful prospect that carrieth the optiques very far, where the choisest beau∣ties
both of City and Suburbs use to resort in the Summer, to solace themselves,
and breath fresh aire.</P>
<P>Thus have we rambled through the City of London, and waded hitherto
through universals (wherein there is not alwaies plain-dealing) we will now
hunt dry foot after particulars, and find out the Primitive mode, &amp; method of
Government which <HI>London</HI> had, with the Titles of her chief <HI>Magistrates;</HI> We
will then Muster her twelve prime Companies, with all the rest of her Corpo∣rations;
Then, a Perambulation shall be made through all her Precincts, Al∣dermanries
and Wards, as far as the point of the Lord Mayors Sword doth
reach; Then shall there be a Parallel 'twixt <HI>London,</HI> and other the greatest Ci∣ties
in the world; wherein it will appear to the impartial discerning Reader,
that, if consideration be had to the Prerogatives and power of her chiefest Ma∣gistrates,
to their plenty, magnificence and hospitality, to the security of Passen∣gers
up and down her streets at midnight, as well as at noon daies, The City of
<HI>London</HI> admits no Parallel.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Political Government, and Civil
Sway of the City of London.</HEAD>
<P>IT is no incongruous allusion, that some Polititians make, when they com∣pare
a <HI>City</HI> to a great <HI>Ship,</HI> whereof Government is the <HI>Healm and Rudder,</HI>
which regulate, and guide her course; <HI>Good Lawes and Constitutions,</HI> are
the Cables and Ligaments; The <HI>Main-Mast</HI> is Religion, and the Stan∣dard,
of the Crosse; the <HI>Foremast</HI> is Honour and Renown; the <HI>Mise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mast</HI> is
Trade and Wealth; <HI>Iudgement</HI> and Prudence is the <HI>Ballast;</HI> Authority and
strength the <HI>Artillery.</HI> This Comparison may quadrat with <HI>London,</HI> as much
as with any other City, on the surface of the Earth. The Lord <HI>Maior</HI> is as the
<HI>Pilot</HI> and <HI>Master;</HI> the <HI>Aldermen,</HI> his <HI>Mates;</HI> the <HI>Recorder and Sheriffs</HI> the chief
<HI>Gunners;</HI> the <HI>Scavengers,</HI> the <HI>Swabbers;</HI> other inferior Officers are the Mariners,
to weigh Anchors, to hoise and furle the Sails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the primitive Government of <HI>London</HI> in the time of the <HI>Britains,</HI>
Antiquity scarce affords us any light, whereby to discern what it was, <HI>Caesar</HI>
gives us most, when he writes, that <HI>Mandrubacius</HI> was King of the <HI>Londoners,</HI>
or the <HI>Trinobants,</HI> which last word extends also to some of the <HI>Counties</HI> adja∣cent;
But it may be wondred, that <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> should know so much, in
regard that He never took firm footing in Great <HI>Britain,</HI> but, by way of explo∣ration,
did only <HI>d'scover</HI> Her; <HI>Augustus</HI> and <HI>Tiberius</HI> may be said to <HI>conceal</HI>
Her. <HI>Caligula</HI> intending an Invasion, was diverted by his Warres with the
<HI>Germans. Claudi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Caesar</HI> (from whom <HI>Glocester</HI> takes her name, being no other
then <HI>Castrum Claud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> the Castle of <HI>Claudius)</HI> was the first that fixt here, and he sent
over <HI>Publius Agriola</HI> for his Lieutenant, who took great pains to civilize the
Nation: and as he was about the work, he sent notice to Rome, that he prefer∣red
the <HI>British</HI> wits before the <HI>Gallic.</HI> Then was <HI>London</HI> made a <HI>Praefectura,</HI> and
the Magistrate in chief, was called <HI>Praefect</HI> (as he of <HI>Rome</HI> is called to this day)
this Title continued all the time that the <HI>Romans</HI> had dominion here, which
was above 300 years. Afterwards, the <HI>Romans</HI> having so many great Irons in
the fire by Warres they had against divers Nations, who had revolted from
them, they drain'd this Iland not only of great numbers of the <HI>British Youth,</HI> to
serve them in their Warres abroad, but drew away at last their own <HI>Legions;</HI>
whereupon, the Iland being thus grown weak, much depopulated, and to a long
de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uetude of Arms, the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who are now the <HI>English</HI> (yet keep still their
first denomination of <HI>Saxons,</HI> both in the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Tongues to this day)
came over with a considerable strength, and having in a <HI>Parly</HI> on <HI>Salsbury</HI>
Plains, musiered most of the <HI>British</HI> Nobility by a stratagem, and taken <HI>Vortiger</HI>
the King Prisoner, He for his ransom was forc'd to give, not only <HI>London,</HI> but
most part of the Iland to the <HI>Saxons.</HI> And the chief Magistrate of <HI>London,</HI> they
call'd <HI>Portreve,</HI> which is a Gardian or Governour of a Port, and that name is
yet used in <HI>England,</HI> in some places. The <HI>Saxons</HI> then changed their names
into <HI>Englishmen,</HI> yet they continued <HI>Pagans</HI> a long time after, but at last, the
<HI>Britains</HI> converted them to Christianity, and then the City of <HI>London</HI> flourished
exceedingly for many Ages, till there came over a swarm of <HI>Danes,</HI> who proved
more fatal to <HI>London,</HI> then any other Nation; for by fire and sword, they had
almost utterly destroyed Her, had not the <HI>Londoners</HI> at last rowz'd up their spi∣rits,
who making vertue of necessity, did fall upon King <HI>Swein</HI> the insulting E∣nemy,
with such a resolution, that by a mighty slaughter, and extraordinary
<PB N="34" REF="27"/>
prowesse, they utterly repel'd him; The City having recovered her former
lustre (though 'twas a good while first) she continued under the English Go∣vernment,
and the Magistracy of a <HI>Portreve,</HI> till the <HI>Norman</HI> rush'd in; yet
the Title was not alter'd a good while after, when at last he came to be call'd
<HI>Bayliffe,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Provost: Richard</HI> the first, for supporting the <HI>Croy sada,</HI>
and his Warres in the Holy Land, got great Contributions of monies, from
the <HI>Londoners;</HI> in lieu whereof, he gave them leave to choose two Bayliffs an∣nually.
King <HI>Iohn</HI> after him chang'd their Bayliffs into a <HI>Maior,</HI> and two
<HI>Sheriffs:</HI> To these <HI>Henry</HI> the third adds some <HI>Aldermen,</HI> who though yeerly E∣legible
at first, grew afterwards Perpetual; Now, this Word <HI>Alderman,</HI> is con∣sonant
to <HI>Senator,</HI> being both derived from old Age and Gravity.</P>
<P>The first <HI>Alderman</HI> we read of in <HI>England,</HI> was in the time of King <HI>Edgar,</HI> a∣bout
800 years agoe, whose name was <HI>Ailwine,</HI> and was descended of the blood
Royal, as appeares by his Epitaph in that goodly <HI>Monastery,</HI> in the Ile of <HI>Ely,</HI>
whereof he was founder himself, which Epitaph runs thus.
<Q><L>Hic requiescit Dom. Ailwinus inclyti Regis Edgari Cognatus, totius Angliae</L>
<L>Aldermannus, &amp; hujus Sacri coenobii miraculosus Fundator.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here resteth the Lord <HI>Ailwine</HI> (Cousin to Noble King <HI>Edgar)</HI> Alderman of all
<HI>England,</HI> which some interpret chief Justice, &amp; miraculous Founder of this holy
Abbey, Hence it may be infer'd, that the appellation of <HI>Alderman,</HI> is not only
venerable, but ancient, &amp; honourable. And from this Lord <HI>Ailwine,</HI> it seemes the
first <HI>Maior</HI> of <HI>London</HI> descended, who was <HI>Henry Fitz-Alwin, Anno</HI> 1191. who
continued many years in the Office, &amp; lies buried in St. <HI>Mary Bothaw,</HI> near <HI>Lon∣don-stone;</HI>
and the next <HI>Maior</HI> to him was <HI>Roger Fitz-Alwin,</HI> after whom he
Office grew annual.</P>
<P>The City being thus, in tract of time, come to a fixed and setled Govern∣ment,
she began to flourish exceedingly. And as she increased in Men, Manu∣factures,
and Merchandizing, so the Kings did enlarge their royal favours unto
Her, <HI>Anno 1226. Henry</HI> the third confirmed unto the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> free
Warren, or liberty to hunt about the City, and in the Warren of <HI>Stanes;</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, that the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> should passe Toll-free, through∣out
all <HI>England,</HI> and that the <HI>Keddles</HI> and <HI>Weres</HI> in the Rivers of <HI>Thames</HI> and
<HI>Medway,</HI> should be plucked up and destroyed for ever, because Navigation to
<HI>London</HI> might be more free. <HI>Roger Renger</HI> was Maior, when these Patents were
granted. A few years after the liberties, and franchises of <HI>London,</HI> were ratified
by the same King, who granted, that either <HI>Sheriff</HI> should have two <HI>Clarks,</HI> and
two <HI>Sargeants,</HI> and that the Citizens should have a <HI>Common Seal:</HI> A little af∣ter
the same <HI>King</HI> granted that the <HI>Maior Elect,</HI> should be presented to the
<HI>Barons</HI> of the Exchequer, and they should admit him. Moreover, he gave way,
that the City should be fortified with <HI>Pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and Iron <HI>Chains,</HI> drawn athwart o∣ver
the streets.</P>
<P><HI>Anno 1326. Edward</HI> the third much increased the Immunities of the City,
and the Authority of the <HI>Maior;</HI> for he granted, that the <HI>Maior should be Iu∣stice
for the Gaol delivery</HI> at Newgate, and have power to reprieve Prisoners.
That the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> should not be constrained to go out of the City of
<HI>London,</HI> to any Warre; He granted also, that the liberties and franchises of the
City, should not after that time be taken into the <HI>Kings</HI> hands, as it had bin of∣ten
before, when a <HI>Custos</HI> was put in. Moreover, He granted by Letters Pa∣tents,
that there should be no other <HI>Eschetor</HI> in the City, but the
<HI>Maior.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1338. He granted, that the <HI>Sargeants</HI> attending the Maior and the
Sheriffs, should bear <HI>Maces silver and gilt,</HI> with the Royal Arms engraven.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="27"/>
<HI>Anno</HI> 1356. The same King ordained, that whereas the <HI>Aldermen</HI> were used
to be chang'd <HI>yeerly,</HI> they should not be removed without special cause for the
future. Then for the higher honour, and Authority of the Office, the Sword
was added with the Cap of Maintenance.</P>
<P>Thus in proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of time, the Government of <HI>London,</HI> grew to be more and
more established.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1415. Sir <HI>Henry Barton</HI> being Maior, ordained <HI>Lanthorns and Lights</HI>
to be hang'd out on the Winter Evenings, betwixt <HI>Alhollontide</HI> and <HI>Candlemas:</HI>
Sir <HI>Iohn Norman,</HI> being Maior, was the first who went upon the River to <HI>West∣minster,</HI>
having made a stately <HI>Barge</HI> to that purpose, <HI>Anno</HI> 1453. And the rest
of the <HI>Companies</HI> followed that laudable Example, with their Barges
also.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1473. Sir <HI>Iohn Tate</HI> being Maior, the Sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> were appoin∣ted
each of them, to have <HI>sixteen Serjeants,</HI> and every Serjeant to have his
<HI>Yeoman;</HI> Moreover, they were to have <HI>six Clerks,</HI> a <HI>Secondary,</HI> a <HI>Clark of the
Papers,</HI> with fower other Clarks, besides the <HI>Under Sheriffs</HI> Clark.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1484. It happened, that there was successively one after the other,
three Mayors, and three Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> in the compasse of one year; by rea∣son
of the sweating sickness, which rag'd so extreamly.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1501. Sir <HI>John Sha</HI> being <HI>Maior,</HI> added some state to the Office; for
it was ordered, that the Aldermen his Brethren should attend him on Horse∣back,
from Guild-hall to the Rivers side, when he took Barge for <HI>Westminster;</HI>
Besides, he was the first who kept Court in his own House, for redressing of
such matters that came before him; Sir <HI>William Capel</HI> being Maior of <HI>London,</HI>
caus'd <HI>Cages</HI> to be set up in every Ward, for the punishments of <HI>Vagabends,</HI>
and <HI>Rogues. Anno</HI> 1556. Sir <HI>Thomas Ossley</HI> being Mayor, the <HI>Night Bel-man</HI>
was first ordained.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> did much favour the City of <HI>London;</HI> and for the better
Government, thereof, gave way for a <HI>Provost Marshal</HI> to be appoin∣ted.</P>
<P>Thus have we observed, that the Governours in chief of the City of <HI>London,</HI>
have had from time to time, differing appellations. Under the <HI>Britains,</HI> they
were call'd Kings; The <HI>Romans</HI> stiled them, <HI>Praefects.</HI> The <HI>Saxons, Portreves.</HI>
The <HI>Norman</HI> Kings at their first comming, <HI>Bayliffs,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Provosts,</HI>
Then came the Office to be established in the Title of <HI>Maior,</HI> which hath conti∣nued
any time these 467. years, though it was interrupted sometimes by a
<HI>Custos;</HI> which some of the Kings, as <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the first, upon
a displeasure against the City, were used to appoint.</P>
<P>This great <HI>Urban</HI> Magistrate, the Maior of <HI>London,</HI> useth to be chosen upon
the feast of St. <HI>Michael the Archangel,</HI> every year out of the six and twenty Al∣dermen,
who are his Brethren; but he takes not his place, until the 28. of <HI>Octo∣ber</HI>
next following.</P>
<P>Touching the State and Authority of the Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> there is no
<HI>Oppidan</HI> Magistrate in Christendom, all things well considered, lives in a grea∣ter;
Let us examine the particulars, and first go to his domestical attendance,
and the Officers thereunto belonging, which are, 1. A Sword-bearer. 2. Com∣mon
Hunt. 3. Common Cryer. And 4. Water Bayliffs, all Esquires by their
places. Then is there the Coroner of <HI>London,</HI> three Sergeant Carvers, 3. Sar∣geants
of the Chamber; Sargeant of the Channel, 4 Yeomen of the Water side.
The Under Water-Bayliffe; two Yeomen of the Chamber, three Meal-weighets;
two Yeomen of the Wood-Wharfs; and most of these have their
Servants allowed them; but the common Huntsman and Water-Bayliffe have
two a peece; some of them have Liveries from the Lord Maior, and the rest
from the Chamber of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="28"/>
There be divers other great publick Officers belong to the Government of
the City of <HI>London,</HI> as the two Sherif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, which, like the Lord Maior, are but an∣nual;
The Recorder, the Chamberlain, the Common Sergeant, the Town-Clark,
or common Clark, the Remembrancer, all Esquires.</P>
<P>The Sheriffs are chosen upon Midsummer day: they formerly were used to be
elected out of the Commonalty; and sometimes they came to be Aldermen, as
many Aldermen were made <HI>Maiors,</HI> though not having bin <HI>Sheriffs;</HI> But of
latter years, the Sheriffs have bin Aldermen before, or presently after their E∣lection;
And 'tis remarkable, that <HI>Nicolas Faringdon</HI> was 4 times Maior of
<HI>London,</HI> and yet never Sheriff.</P>
<P>Now touching the Election of these Officers, we shall give a brief account,
the prime Magistrate, the Lord Maior and the Aldermen, met at Guild∣hall
at 8. in the morning, in their Scarlet Gowns, and their Cloaks fur'd riding
on Horseback, and having bin a while in the Councel Chamber, they come
forth into the Orphans Court, whence they go in their Cloaks to the Chappel,
to hear Service and Sermon, where the Lord Maior, with some of the Alder∣men,
take the Communion, which being ended, and Offrings delivered, they
return to the Councel Chamber, and thence to the <HI>Hustings,</HI> the highest
Court; where the Recorder makes a Speech, touching the business in hand: then
they go back to the Lord Maiors Court, where they remain, the doors shut un∣til
the Election be brought unto them; Then the common Sargeant having
the Sheriffs on either side, and the Sheriffs other Officers about them, makes
another Speech, touching the Custom of the City in this kind; whereupon,
they choose two, whose names are brought up to the Lord Maior and the Al∣dermen,
who by scrutiny, elect one of those two, whom the Commons had no∣minated
before. Then the Lord Maior returns to the <HI>Hustings,</HI> and he who is
chosen, goeth upon his left hand, and sitteth next him; Then the Recorder
speaks again to the Commons, nominating the person whom the Lord Maior,
and the Aldermen had admitted, and demands whether it be their free choyce;
the commons affirming it the Sword-bearer goes to the Lord Maior, Elect, and
taketh off his Tipper (which he takes for his fee) and puts on his Chain; where∣upon,
he making a short Speech of gratitude, the Lord Maior, and the new E∣lect,
go to the Eldest Sheriffs House to dinner.</P>
<P>After dinner, the Lord Elect taking the Common Hunt, and other Officers
to attend him, besides a Company of Aldermen, goeth to the Lord Keeper of
the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> where five or six Aldermen present him, wearing their
Violet Gowns.</P>
<P>The morrow after <HI>Michaelmas day,</HI> the Lord Maior and the Aldermen go
with the two new Sheriffs to the Exchequer-chamber in Westminster, where
they are presented and sworn, and the old Sheriffs are sworn also to their ac∣count.</P>
<P>On <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Iudes</HI> day, the Aldermen and Sheriffs attend the old Lord
Maior at his House, whence they come in their formalities to the <HI>Hustings,</HI>
where being sate, the common Cryer commands silence: then the Town-Clark
exhibites an Oath to the Lord Maior Elect, which being done, the for∣mer
Lord Maior giveth place to the New; which being done, the Chamberlain
delivers him the Scepter, next the Keyes of the Common Seal; and lastly, the
Seal of the Majoralty; Then the Sword-bearer delivers him the
Sword.</P>
<P>On the morrow after, all the Aldermen and Sheriffs solemnly meet at the
new Lord Maiors House, by 8. in the morning, whence they go to the Guild-Hall,
and thence to the Vine-Tree, where they take Barge, and are rowed in
state to <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> the rest of the chief Companies attending in their se∣veral
Barges, with their Arms, Colours, and Streamers, in a very gay manner;
Being come to the Hall, they go round about, and salute all the Tribunals of
<PB N="37" REF="28"/>
justice: then they ascend to the <HI>Exchequer</HI> Chamber to the <HI>Barons,</HI> where af∣ter
the <HI>Recorder</HI> hath made a Speech, the Oath is administer'd. Then they come
down to the Hall, and go first to the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> then to the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI>
and so to <HI>Westminster Abbey,</HI> where having walk'd about the <HI>Kings Tombs,</HI> they
return to their Barge, and so to <HI>London</HI> again; where, being landed, they go
to the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> where a most plentifull dinner is prepared, which lasts many
hours, being called, <HI>the Lord Mayors feast;</HI> The Lords of the privy Councel, the
Judges, with other Lords and Ladies of the best quality, are thither invited;
After dinner, the Lord Mayor with all the Companies attending, ride solemn∣ly
to Saint <HI>Pauls,</HI> to do their devotions; and so the Ceremony of that great day is
concluded.</P>
<P>Touching the Election of the <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen
meet at 8 in the morning at Guild-hall in their violet-colour'd Gowns, and
their Cloaks of Scarlet lin'd but without horses; where from the <HI>Counsel</HI>-Chamber,
they go to the <HI>Orphans</HI> Court, &amp; so to the <HI>Hustings,</HI> where the <HI>Recor∣der</HI>
having made a speech touching the present meeting, the Mayor &amp; Aldermen
go to the Mayors Court, the dores shut upon them, then the Commons fall to
the Election of <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> as also a <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> two <HI>Bridg-masters,</HI> the <HI>Auditors</HI>
of the City and <HI>Bridg-house</HI> Accounts, and the <HI>Surveyors</HI> for Beer and Ale:
which being done, the <HI>Sheriffs</HI> with the other Officers, the Common Cryer go∣ing
before them with his Mace, go up to the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI> and the <HI>Aldermen,</HI> to
cary up the report of what is done at the <HI>Hustings,</HI> whither the Lord Mayor,
and the Aldermen descend again, and confirm the Elections; Then the <HI>Recor∣der</HI>
making them a Speech of thanks, the meeting ends.</P>
<P>Now touching the <HI>Hustings,</HI> which we have mentioned so often, it is the an∣cient'st
and highest Court of the City of <HI>London;</HI> Touching the Etymology of
it, it is a pure <HI>Saxon</HI> word, and is derived of <HI>House</HI> and <HI>dhing</HI> or <HI>thing,</HI> which
among the <HI>Saxons</HI> signified a Cause or Plea; in so much that <HI>Hustings</HI> is no other
then the House of Causes, or Pleading; and <HI>Thingere</HI> was the ancient word for a
Lawyer or Pleader; This Court preserves the Laws, Rights, Franchises, Customs
and Dignities of the City; There be handled also there the intricat'st accounts,
and Pleas of the Crowns, and of the whole Kingdom; which Court hath for ma∣ny
Ages, conserv'd inviolably its own Prerogatives and Customs. This Court
was anciently held every Munday, but it was chang'd of late years into Tues∣day,
because of the Sheriffs intending the Market, which being kept upon Mun∣day
would hinder their sitting in the <HI>Hustings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edward the Confessors</HI> Lawes refer much to this <HI>Hustings Court;</HI> Moreover,
the Cities o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>York, Winchester, Lincoln,</HI> the Isle of <HI>Shepey,</HI> and other places, have
had their <HI>Hustings.</HI></P>
<P>There is also another Court peculiar to <HI>London,</HI> which discovers as much of <HI>Cha∣rity,</HI>
as of <HI>Policy:</HI> It is call'd the Court of <HI>Requests,</HI> or the Court of <HI>Conscience.</HI>
It was first erected by an act of Common-Councel <HI>Anno 9. Henry</HI> 8. viz. <HI>That
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen for the time being should monthly assign two
Aldermen, and four discreet Commoners, to sit twice a week to hear, and determine
all matters brought before them (betwixt Free-men) where the due debt, or dammage
did not exceed 40S.</HI> Afterwards the said number of Commissioners was en∣creased
to the number of twelve, which continued till the end of <HI>Q. Elizabeths</HI>
Reign; But, <HI>primo Iacobi,</HI> it was confirm'd by Act of Parliament, That the said
Commissioners should have power to exhibit an Oath, and to commit to pri∣son
such as did not obey their Summons, or perform the Orders they made, be∣twixt
Plaintiff and Defendant, Debitor or Creditor, touching any debt, not
amounting to forty shillings; but such hath been the unconscionablenesse and
malice of some men of late times, that they have endeavour'd to overthrow the
the said Court, by cavilling at some doubtful words therein, &amp; wresting them to
a perver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sense, the rich might have power thereby to oppresse the poorer sort,
<PB N="38" REF="29"/>
by bringing them to <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall to a further expence of time and trou∣ble,</P>
<P>There is then the Court of the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen, which is a
Court of <HI>Record;</HI> the Recorder and the two Sheriffs (being Aldermen not else)
are members of this Court, whose office it is, to redresse and correct the errors,
defaults and misprisions which happen in the Government of the City; This
Court is kept Tuesdays and Thursdays throughout the year.</P>
<P>Then are the two Courts of the Sheriffs, one for every Counter, whereof
there are two Lawyers as Judges, well read in the Customs of the City, as well
as the common Laws; but if an erroneous judgment be given before the
Sheriffs, the party griev'd may sue a <HI>Writ of error,</HI> and remove it to the <HI>Hustings.</HI></P>
<P>Then is the <HI>Court of Orphans;</HI> For the Mayor and Aldermen, by Custome,
have the custody of the <HI>Orphans</HI> within the City, and if they commit the
Custody of the <HI>Orphans</HI> to another man, he shall have a <HI>ravishment of
ward</HI> if the Orphan be taken away; it being enacted that the Mayor and Cham∣berlain
of <HI>London</HI> for the time being, shall have the keeping of all the Lands and
Goods of such Orphans, as happen within the City; saving to the King, and
other Lords, their Rights of such as hold of them out of the same Liberty;
Now the Chamberlain is a sole Corporation to himself, and his Successors for
Orphans; and a Recognizance made to him and his Successors touching Or∣phans,
shall by custome go to his Successor; Moreover, the Government of
Orphans, is so invested in the Mayor, that it any Orphans sue in the <HI>Ecclesiasti∣cal</HI>
Court, or else-where for a Legacy, or duty due to them, by the Custome, a
<HI>Prohibition</HI> doth lye.</P>
<P>Then is there the Court of <HI>Common Councel,</HI> which hath some resemblance
of the high Court of Parliament: for it consists of two Houses, <HI>viz.</HI> the one of
the Mayor and Aldermen▪ and the other of the Commoners of the City; Here
they make Constitutions and Laws for advancement of Trade, and regulation
of other things which bind the whole City.</P>
<P>There is then the Court of the <HI>Chamberlain</HI> for Apprentices; Now, one may
be free of <HI>London</HI> three manner of wayes, first, by <HI>Service;</HI> secondly, by <HI>Birth∣right,</HI>
being sonne of a Freeman; And thirdly, by <HI>Redemption</HI> by Order of the
Court of Aldermen.</P>
<P>The Chamberlain of <HI>London,</HI> is an Officer very considerable in point of pow∣er:
for without him no man can set up shop, or occupy his Trade without be∣ing
sworn before him; No man can set-over an Apprentice to another, but by
his Licence; He may imprison any that disobeys his Summons, or any Appren∣rice
that mildemeans himself, or punish him otherwise.</P>
<P>There are the Courts of the <HI>Coroner,</HI> and the <HI>Escheator,</HI> which both belong
to the Lord Mayor; he being <HI>Coroner,</HI> and <HI>Escheator</HI> by vertue of his authority,
and Office.</P>
<P>Then is there a Court for the conservation of the water &amp; River of <HI>Thames,</HI>
which belongs to the Lord Mayor, from <HI>Stanes</HI>-bridge unto the water of <HI>Yendal</HI>
and <HI>Medway,</HI> as is amply spoken of before.</P>
<P>Then is there the Court of the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> and this Court is held
within the Verge of the City before the Steward by prescription of debt, tres∣passe,
and other actions; now, part of the Tower is within the City, and part
in <HI>Middlesex, viz.</HI> the East part, but the West in <HI>London,</HI> whereof there was
a notable example in the person of Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury,</HI> who being poyson'd
in a Chamber on the West part, the principal murtherers were tryed before
Commissioners of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Termin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and so was Sir <HI>Gervase Elwayes</HI>
the Live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enant of the Tower at that time.</P>
<P>There is also a peculiar Court, call'd the <HI>Court of Policies,</HI> and of Assurances
in <HI>London,</HI> to Marchants that venture and traffique on the Seas, where ships
<PB N="39" REF="29"/>
and goods are insur'd at so much in the hundred, where there is an Officer of
good quality who Registers these Assurances.</P>
<P>Then is the Court of <HI>Halmote,</HI> or Hall Court, for every Company of <HI>London</HI>
having a particular Hall. They use to meet there to deliberate of matters belong∣ing
to the Company.</P>
<P>Then is the Court of the <HI>Wardmote,</HI> or of the <HI>Wardmote Inquest,</HI> For the
whole City being divided to 26 Wards, every Ward hath such an Inquest con∣sisting
of twelve or more, who inquire after abuses and disorders, and present
them to be redressed.</P>
<P>There is also a kind of Court call'd the Colledge of the President, Censors, and
Commonalty or <HI>Physicians,</HI> who have peculiar Lawes of their own: and among
other one is remarkable, that if one who is not of the mystery of a <HI>Physician</HI> or
<HI>Chirurgion,</HI> take upon him the Cure of a sick Body, and he dieth of the
Potion or Medicament, this is, as <HI>Britton</HI> the great Lawyer saith, <HI>Covert
Felony.</HI></P>
<P>Then is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Court of <HI>Sessions,</HI> or monthly Goal-delivery at the Old-Bayly,
both for the City and <HI>Middlesex</HI> for tryal of Felons, whereof the Lord
Mayor is the chief Judge, and hath power of reprieving.</P>

<HEAD>Touching the
Ecclesiastical Government
OF THE
City of LONDON.</HEAD>
<P>HAving thus in a cursory way run over, and taken in <HI>grosse</HI> as it were,
a view of the <HI>Civil</HI> Government of the City of <HI>London;</HI> we will
now make some inspections into her spiritual way of Government,
which was alwaies Episcopal from the beginning; for there be Re∣cords
that may we I induce us to believe, that in the time of the <HI>Britains</HI>
there were Bishops of <HI>London,</HI> whereof they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay <HI>Thean</HI> was the first; and in the
Reign of <HI>Constantine,</HI> we read that <HI>Restitutus,</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> had his Session
in a Councel he summoned at <HI>Arles;</HI> After that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Saxons</HI> making twice an
irruption into this Island, and at last possessing the better part of it, and being
not reduced a good while after, to Christianity, there was a long interruption,
and no Bishop of <HI>London</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Austin</HI> the Monk came over, who was call'd the
Apost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the <HI>Saxons</HI> or <HI>English,</HI> for he absolutely converted them; He conse∣cra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
<HI>Melitus</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> from whom to Doctor <HI>Iuxon</HI> yet living,
there are upon good Record the names of 97 Bishops of <HI>London,</HI> who succeeded
one another. In so much that the City of <HI>London</HI> was not without a Bishop
any time these thousand years till now: The Prior of the holy T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inity at <HI>Ald∣gate</HI>
was a great man also in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vernment of the City, for he used to ride with
the Mayor &amp; the Aldermen in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but the chief administration of all <HI>Ecclesi∣astical</HI>
affairs was in the Bishop <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>London</HI> hath oftentimes far'd
the better for her Bishops, who have done her many signal good services, upon
some discomposures; &amp; stood as a skreen 'twixt the fury of the Prince and Her.
When the <HI>Norman</HI> came over, and was much incens'd against the City, <HI>William</HI>
her Bishop then, took off the edg of his fury, and introducing her to the Con∣querors
favour, got <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er that famous Charter which is worthy to be here inserted.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="30"/>

<P><HI>William King,</HI> greets <HI>William Bishop,</HI> and <HI>Gode froy Portreve,</HI> and

that ony man you ony wrongys beed, and God you keep.</P>
<P>The said <HI>Bishop William,</HI> procured this <HI>Charter,</HI> from the insulting Conque∣rour,
as appears by his Epitaph; And this <HI>Saxon</HI> Charter, was not only con∣firmed,
but inlarged by <HI>Henry</HI> the first in <HI>Latine;</HI> Now as far Soils are sub∣ject
to produce rank Weeds, so rich populous Cities are alwayes subject to
bring forth turbulent spirits, whereof there is a world of examples in all sto∣ries;
nor doth <HI>London</HI> want good store of them, who used to bandy against
their Soveraign Prince, and we well know, how often she forfeited her Charter
that way.</P>
<P>It stands upon Record, how <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Richard</HI> the
2d, with other Kings, had Her their fore enemies; It is well known, how often
she smarted for it, how often her Posts &amp; Chains were taken away, how her Maior
&amp; Sheriffs wereclap'd in Prison, and a <HI>Custos</HI> appointed over her in the interim;
How <HI>Rich.</HI> the first trounced her for murthering the <HI>Iews</HI> how she suffered for
the <HI>barbarous fray</HI> 'twixt the <HI>Goldsmiths</HI> and <HI>Taylors</HI> Servants; For the blood,
shed 'twixt her and the men of <HI>Westminster</HI> on St. <HI>Iames</HI>'s day; For the brawl
about the <HI>Bakers loaf</HI> in Salsbury Court; For the outrages done to St. <HI>Martins</HI>
Sanctuary men; for the <HI>Ill May day;</HI> and a little of late years for the murther
of Doctor <HI>Lamb.</HI> But now that we are giving a touch of her Church Govern∣ment,
It is observable in History, how her Bishops proved her best friends at
a pinch, to pull her out of such plunges, and rectifie her again in the opinion
of her <HI>Soveraign,</HI> Nay it stands upon good Record, that she was no City, till
she had a Bishop; for we well know, that a City must have of necessity, a Ca∣thedral
Church, with the Seat and See of a Bishop.</P>

yet are they no Incorporation.</P>
<P>35. The Company of <HI>Stationers</HI> of great antiquity before <HI>Printing</HI> was in∣vented:
their old dwelling was in <HI>Paternoster Row,</HI> and the adjoyning parts; yet

<P>Thus have we visited all the publick Societies, and Corporations of this rich
and renowned City, who may be called her best sorts of Children, for increa∣sing
of her Wealth, and advancement of Trade. Now every of these Compa∣nies
hath a handsome and well-furnish'd stately Hall, with a Clark, and other
Ministerial Officers thereunto belonging, to attend them, when they meet
there to consult, and inorder what may conduce to the better regulation of
the Society, and promoting of the publique good; They also use to meet there
frequently to rejoyce, and make plentiful Feasts, for the increase of love
and good Neighbourhood among themselves; And though there be some, who
hold such Corporations, and little <HI>Body politiques,</HI> of this kind, to be prejudicial
to <HI>Monarchy;</HI> yet they may be said to be one of the <HI>Glories</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and
wherein she surpasseth all other Cities.</P>

<HEAD>Of the first Ward or, Aldermanry, called
Tower-street Ward.</HEAD>
<P>OUt of an honour which is due to the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> it being the
prime Fortresse and propugnacle of the City, both by water and
Land, the chief Armory and Archive of the whole Island, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
we will begin with <HI>Tower-street Ward,</HI> it being the first Ward East∣ward
within the Wall, extending it self along the River from the Tower al∣most
to <HI>Billinsgate;</HI> One half of the Tower, the ditch on the West side, and
Bulwarks adjoyning, do stand within that part where the wall of the City of old
time went streight from the Postern gate South to the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> before
that the <HI>Tower</HI> was perfectly built. Then was <HI>Tower hill</HI> sometimes a clear large
plot of ground, but now pester'd with encroachments of houses, built upon the
banks of the ditch, much to the prejudice, and choaking up of the said
ditch.</P>
<P>This Hill hath alwaies a Scaffold, and Gallowes erected for execution of
Traytors and others, which the City opposed at first.</P>
<P>Many clashings have been also 'twixt the Lord Mayor and the Lieutenant of
the <HI>Tower</HI> about the extent of their Liberties, and some Priviledges touching
prisoners the Lievtenant claim'd, which were reconciled 1585; in Queen
<HI>Elizabeths</HI> time at <HI>Nonsuch.</HI></P>
<P>On the Northside of Tower-hill, there is <HI>Lumly house;</HI> then is <HI>Tower-street,</HI>
stretching from Tower-hill to Saint <HI>Margaret Pattens.</HI> At the end of this is
the Parish Church called <HI>Alhallows Barking;</HI> on the North side whereof was
sometimes a fair Chappel, built by <HI>Richard</HI> the first; and some say, that his Heart
(which is call'd <HI>Coeur de lion)</HI> was buried there under the high Altar; it became
afterward a little Colledge of Priests, and stood till <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth. <HI>Henry
Howard</HI> Earl of <HI>Surrey,</HI> being beheaded, was buried in <HI>Barking</HI> Church; <HI>Iohn
Fisher</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> having layen naked upon the Scaffold a long time,
was at last carried thither, and buried in the Churchyard; There were divers
other men of note buried there: and lately Doctor <HI>Land</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI>
who was beheaded by the long Parliament.</P>
<P>By the West side of <HI>Barking</HI> Church lyeth <HI>Sydon</HI> Lane, commonly call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
<HI>Sithing</HI> Lane, wherein among other large Buildings, there is <HI>Walsingham</HI>
House.</P>
<P>Then is there the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Olave,</HI> hard by <HI>Hart</HI>-street, where
there are some Monuments of the noble Family of the <HI>Radcliffs</HI> Earls of
<HI>Sussex.</HI></P>
<P>Then is there <HI>Mart-lane,</HI> part whereof lies in <HI>Algate</HI> Ward, where there
are many fair Houses, &amp; rich Marchants. Then is there <HI>Mincheon</HI> Lane, so call'd,
because of Tenements there, sometimes pertaining to the <HI>Minchuns,</HI> or <HI>Nuns</HI>
of St. <HI>Helens</HI> in <HI>Bishopsgate-street;</HI> There dwelt in this Lane divers strangers in
times pass'd, and they were commonly call'd <HI>Gallimen,</HI> because they brought
up Wines, and other commodities in Gallies, which they landed in the <HI>Thames</HI>
street, in a place call'd Galley Key; They brought also a Coin with them call'd
<HI>Gally half pence,</HI> which was a <HI>Ligurian</HI> Coin; But in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the
fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, it was inordred, that whosoever should import that
Coin with <HI>Suskins</HI> or <HI>Dodkins,</HI> should be punished as a Felon; The <HI>Clothwor∣k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs</HI>
Hall is in this Lane.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="34"/>
Then have you the Parish Church of St. <HI>Mary Pattens,</HI> and Bear Lane hard
by, reaching to <HI>Thames</HI> street; The next is <HI>Spurrier</HI> lane, call'd so in times pass'd,
but now named <HI>Water</HI> lane; then is there <HI>Hart</HI> lane, call'd at first <HI>Harp-lane,</HI>
which likewise reaches to <HI>Thames</HI> street. In this Lane is the <HI>Bakers Hall.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Tower</HI> street 'twixt <HI>Hart</HI>-lane and <HI>Church</HI>-lane, was in times pass'd a qua∣drant
call'd <HI>Galley-row,</HI> because <HI>Galley men</HI> dwelt there: whence may be in∣ferr'd;
that Galleys was a kind of shipping, not unknown to <HI>England</HI> in times
pass'd.</P>
<P>Then have you two Lanes out of <HI>Tower</HI> street, both call'd <HI>Church lanes,</HI> then
hard by, is there another call'd <HI>Fowl-lane.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards you come to the Parish Church of S. <HI>Dunstans</HI> in the East: it is a fair
large Church of an ancient building, with a spacious Church-yard; the chiefest
<HI>Salters</HI> &amp; <HI>Ironmongers</HI> were us'd to be thick there. There are many Monuments
of Knights, and other persons of ranke in this Church; among others, that of Sir
<HI>Iohn Hawkins</HI> the great Seaman.</P>
<P>There are many Keys in this Parish, among others <HI>VVooll Key,</HI> where was
used to be the <HI>Trouage</HI> of Woolls; Then <HI>Custome-house Key,</HI> which part
of the Town was used to be call'd in times passd <HI>Petty VVales.</HI> And some are
of opinion, that the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> when they repair'd to the City, had a
Pallace there, the ruines whereof remain to this day of firm stone.</P>
<P>There was in former times an <HI>Hospital</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Barking,</HI> for the susten∣tation
of poor Priests, with other both men and women that were Lunatick.
And so much in brief for what concerns Tower-street Ward.</P>

<HEAD>Of the second Ward of London called
Portsoken Ward.</HEAD>
<P>VVE will now make a salley out of <HI>Algate,</HI> and visit <HI>Port∣soken
VVard;</HI> This Portsoken signifieth Franchise, where
there was sometimes a very ancient <HI>Guild</HI> or particular
Society, which had its beginning in the Reign of King
<HI>Edgar;</HI> There were then 13 Knights, who desir'd to have a portion of Land
on the East part of the City, which for some signal services done in the wars,

were to run in East <HI>Smithfield</HI> with Spears against all comers, which was us'd
to be gloriously performed; So that the King namd that place <HI>Knighten Guild,</HI>
and so prescribed its bound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which extended from <HI>Algate</HI> to the place where
now the Barrs are Eastward, on both sides of the street, and Northward as far
as <HI>Bishopsgate;</HI> and Southward as far as the <HI>Thames,</HI> and so far into the River
that a horieman might ride at low water, and throw his Spear; These Knights
continued their Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rter in the daies of <HI>Edgar, Ethelred,</HI> and <HI>Canutus,</HI> which <HI>Ed∣ward
the Confessor</HI> did not only ratifie but enlarge, which deed remain'd a long
time fairly written in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Letter &amp; Tongue, in the Book of the late House
of the holy Trinity; after that <HI>VVilliam Rufus</HI> confirm'd the said Charter unto
the Heirs of those Knights, as followeth;</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="35"/>
<HI>William</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> to <HI>Maurice</HI> Bishop, and <HI>Godefroy de Ma∣gun,</HI>
and <HI>Richard de Parre,</HI> and to his faithful people of <HI>London,</HI> Gree∣ting.
Know ye me to have granted to the men of <HI>Knighten Guild,</HI> that be∣long'd
to them, and the Land that belong'd thereunto, with all Customes as
they were used to have the same in the time of my Predecessors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the first after him confirm'd the same; But afterwards the Church of
the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> being founded by Queen <HI>Matilda</HI> within <HI>Aldgate,</HI> such was the
piety of those times, that this <HI>Knighten Guild,</HI> which was of such large extent that
it reach'd unto the Thames, was voluntarily given to the <HI>Canons</HI> of that Church;
And for better ratification of the Grant they offer'd upon the Altar, Saint <HI>Ed∣wards</HI>
Charter with the rest which they had, and put the <HI>Prior of the Holy Trini∣ty,</HI>
in possession and saisin thereof; by the Church of Saint <HI>Butolph,</HI> which was
built thereon, being the head of the Land; All which, King <HI>Henry</HI> confirm'd
by that famous Charter which runs thus.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Henry</HI> King of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>R.</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> to the Sheriffs, and Provost,
and all his Barons, and faithful people, French and English of <HI>London</HI> and
<HI>Middlesex,</HI> Greeting; Know ye me to have granted and confirm'd to the
Church &amp; Canons of the holy Church of the Trinity of <HI>London</HI> the Soke of the
English <HI>Knighten Guild,</HI> and the Land which pertaineth thereunto; and to
the Church of Saint <HI>Buttolph,</HI> as the men of the same <HI>Guild</HI> have given, and
granted unto them; And I will &amp; streightly command, that they hold the same
well, and honourably and freely with <HI>Sack and Soke, Toll and Thea, Infang∣thefe,</HI>
and all Customs belonging to it as the men of the same Guild in the
best sort had it in the time of King <HI>Edward;</HI> and as King <HI>William</HI> my Fa∣ther
and Brother did grant it to them by their Writs, Witnesse <HI>A.</HI> the
Queen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Prior and Canons of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> beind thus seiz'd of the said Land,
and Soke of <HI>Knighten Guild,</HI> being not only a part of the Suburbe without the
Wall, but also within the City, the Prior was for him and his Successors ad∣mitted
as one of the Aldermen of <HI>London;</HI> And according to the Customs of
the City, he did sit in Court, and rode<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Mayor and his brethren the
Aldermen, as one of them, in Scarlet, or other Livery as they then us'd: until
the year 1531, at which time, the said Priory was surrendred to <HI>Henry</HI> the
eighth by Act of Parliament, who gave it to Sir <HI>Thomas Audley</HI> Lord Chance∣lour
of England, and he pull'd down the Church, and dissolv'd the Pri∣ory;
since which dissolution, the said Ward of <HI>Portsoken</HI> hath been govern'd
by Temporal men, one of the Aldermen of <HI>London.</HI> Thus much for the out∣bound
<HI>Portsoken</HI> Ward, or <HI>Knighten Guild,</HI> touching the antiquity and Go∣vernment
thereof.</P>
<P>Now touching the Parts thereof, it is to be observed, that the East part of
the Tower stands therein, then an Hospital of Saint <HI>Katherine</HI> founded by the
foresaid Queen <HI>Matilda,</HI> wife to King <HI>Stephen,</HI> by Licence of the Prior, and
Convent of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> on whose ground she built it; Queen
<HI>Elianor</HI> Wife to <HI>Edward</HI> the first, was a second Foundresse there, and appointed
one Master, three Brethren Chaplains, and three Sisters, ten poor women,
with six poor Clerks; for the maintenance of whom, she gave the Mannor of
<HI>Clarton</HI> in <HI>VViltshiere,</HI> and <HI>Upchurch</HI> in <HI>Kent, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Queen <HI>Philippa</HI> Wife to <HI>Edward</HI> the third, founded a Chantry there, and
contributed to that Hospital ten pounds Land a year; The Quiere there, was
not much inferior to that of <HI>Pauls,</HI> which by one Doctor <HI>Wilson</HI> being Master
there, was afterwards dissolv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="35"/>
On the East and by North of the <HI>Tower</HI> lieth <HI>East Smithfield</HI> and <HI>Tower</HI> hill,
two Plots of ground so call'd without the Walls of the City, where sometimes
flood a Monastery call'd <HI>New Abbey,</HI> founded by <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>3d.</HI> upon the occa∣sion
following; That having escaped a great danger in a tempest at Sea, he
made a vow to build a Monastery, in sign of gratitude to heaven, to the honor of
God and our <HI>Lady of Grace,</HI> which he perform'd accordingly. But the said
Monastery, being afterwards pull'd down by Sir <HI>Arthur Darcy</HI> of late time, in
place thereof is built a large store-house for victual, with convenient Ovens,
for baking of Bisket to serve the <HI>Navy Royal;</HI> the rest of the ground is become
into smal Tenements.</P>
<P>The Company of <HI>Marchant-Taylors,</HI> have built thereabouts, hard by <HI>Hog∣street,</HI>
divers fair Alms-houses for 14 poor women, and endow'd it with main∣tenance
accordingly.</P>
<P>Westward hence from Tower hill towards <HI>Algate,</HI> there was a Monastery
of Nunns of the Order of <HI>Santa Clara,</HI> call'd the <HI>Minories,</HI> founded by <HI>Edmund</HI>
Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> brother to <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Anno</HI> 1293, which was demo∣lished
in <HI>Henry</HI> the eighths time, Dame <HI>Elizabeth Savage</HI> being then Abbesse:
In the room of this Nunnery, there are now store-houses for Armour, and ha∣billaments
for war, with divers Work-houses to that purpose; and hard by,
there is is a small Church, called Saint <HI>Trinity</HI> for the Inhabitants therea∣bouts.</P>
<P>We come now to the Church of Saint <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttolph,</HI> which the Priors of

<P>East from this Parish Church is <HI>Hog-lane,</HI> that stretcheth towards St.

Ward within the Walls, which is called <HI>Ealdgate</HI> Ward, or
<HI>Aldgate,</HI> as taking name of the same gate; The principal
street of this Ward beginneth at <HI>Ealdgate</HI> stretching West to
sometime a fair Well, where now a Pump is placed; From
thence (the way being divided into twain) the first and princi∣pal
street, (called <HI>Aldgate</HI>) runneth on the South side to <HI>Lime-street</HI> corner, and
half that street down on the left hand is also of that Ward.</P>
<P>In the mid way on that South side, betwixt <HI>Ealdgate</HI> and <HI>Lime-street,</HI> is Hart∣horn

and her Heirs by the gift of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in reward of fine pud∣dings

in the year 1590, in place where before was a large Garden-plot, enclosed from
the High-street with a Brick Wall, which Wall being taken down, and the
ground digged deep for cellerage, there was found right under the said Brick
Wall, another Wall of stone with a Gate arch'd of stone, and Gates of Timber,
closed in the middest towards the street; the Timber of the Gates was consu∣med,
but the Hinges of Iron still remained on, and their Staples on both the
sides.</P>
<P>Moreover, in that Wall were square Windowes, with Bars of Iron on ei∣ther
side the Gate; this Wall was under ground above two fathoms deep, as it
was esteemed, and seemed to be the ruines of some House burned in the Reign
of King <HI>Steven,</HI> when the fire began in the House of one <HI>Aleward,</HI> neer <HI>London∣stone,</HI>
and consumed East to <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> whereby it appeareth, how greatly the

one other Lane more West from <HI>Algate,</HI> goeth by <HI>Northumberland</HI>-House

<P>Thus much for bounds. Now for Monuments, or places most anci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt and
notable; I am first to begin with the late dissolved <HI>Priory of the holy Trinity,</HI>
call'd <HI>Christs-Church,</HI> on the right hand within <HI>Aldgate;</HI> This Priory was foun∣ded
by <HI>Matilda,</HI> Queen and Wife to <HI>Henry</HI> the first, in the same place where
<HI>Siredus</HI> somtime began to erect a Church in honour of that Crosse, and of Saint
<HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> of which the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Waltham,</HI> were wont to
receive thirty shillings, the Queen was to acquit her Church thereof; and
in exchange gave unto them a Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, King <HI>Henry</HI> her husband confirmed her
gift; This Church was given to <HI>Norman,</HI> the first Canon regular in all
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The said Queen gave also unto the same Church, and those that served God
therein, the plot of <HI>Aldgate,</HI> and the Soke or Tenements thereunto belonging,
with all Customs, so free as she had held the same, and 25 <HI>l.</HI> Blanks, which she
had of the City of <HI>Exeter,</HI> as appeareth by her Deed, wherein she nameth the
House of Christs-Church, and reporteth <HI>Aldgate</HI> to be of her Demains, which
she granteth, with two parts of the rent of the City of <HI>Excester. Norman</HI>
took on him to be <HI>Prior</HI> of <HI>Christs-Church,</HI> in the year of Christ 1108, in the Pa∣rishes
of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> St. <HI>Michael,</HI> St. <HI>Katherine,</HI> and the <HI>blessed Trini∣ty,</HI>
and was (in old time) of the holy <HI>Crosse,</HI> or holy <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d</HI> Parish.</P>
<P>The <HI>Priory</HI> was builded on a piece of ground in the Parish of St. <HI>Katherine,</HI>
towards <HI>Aldgate,</HI> which lyeth in length, betwixt the Kings-street, by the which
men go towards <HI>Algate</HI> near to the Chappel of St. <HI>Michael</HI> towards the North,
and containeth in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ength eighty three ells, half quarter, and half quartern of the
Kings Iron eln, and lieth in breadth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Soke and Ward of <HI>Aldgate</HI> was
then bounded, as I have before shewn. The Queen was a men also, that the Land
and English <HI>Knighten-Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld</HI> was given unto the Prior <HI>Norman,</HI> and the hono∣rable
man <HI>Geffrey de Clinton,</HI> was a great helper therein, and obtained, that the
Canons might enclose the way betwixt their Church and the Wall of the City,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Priory in processe of time, became a very fair and large Church, rich
in Lands and Ornaments, and passed all the Priories in the City of <HI>London,</HI> or
Shire of <HI>Middlesex.</HI> The Prior whereof was an <HI>Alderman</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> to wit,
of <HI>Portsoken</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>It is Recorded, that <HI>Eustacius</HI> the eighth Prior, about the year 1264, because
he would not deal with temporal Matters, instituted <HI>Theobald Fitz Ivon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Al∣derman
of the said <HI>Portsoken</HI> Ward under him; and that <HI>VVilliam Ri∣sing</HI>
Prior of Christs Church, was sworne Alderman of the said <HI>Portso∣ken</HI>
Ward, in the first of <HI>Richard</HI> the second. These Priors have sitten and
ridden amongst the Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> in Livery like unto them,
faring that his habit was in shape of a spirituall person, at which time
the Prior kept a most bountiful house of meat and drink, both for rich
and poor, as well within the House as at the Gates, to all comers according to
their estates and qualities.</P>
<P>But to take leave of this Priory: King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth minding to reward
Sir <HI>Thomas Audley</HI> Speaker of the Parliament against Cardinal <HI>Woolsey,</HI> as ye
may read in the Chronicle, sent for the Prior, commending him for his
Hospitality, promised him preferment as a man worthy of a far greater dignity,
(which promise surely he performed) and compounded with him, though in
what sort I never heard; so that the Priory, with the appurtenances, was sur∣rendred
<PB N="54" REF="37"/>
to the King, in the month of <HI>Iuly</HI> 1531, the 23 of the said Kings Reign,
the Canons were sent to other houses of the same Order: and the Priory with
the appurtenances, King <HI>Henry</HI> gave to Sir <HI>Tho. Audley</HI> newly knighted, and
afterwards made Lord Chancelour.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Audley</HI> offered the great Church of this Priory, with a ring of nine
Bells well tuned (whereof four of the greatest were since sold to the Parish of
<HI>Stebunbith,</HI> and the five lesser to the Parish of St. <HI>Katherine</HI> Christs-Church, in
exchange for their small Parish Church, minding to have pulled it down, and
to have builded there towards the steeet; But the Parishioners, having doubts
in their heads of after-claps, refused the offer.</P>
<P>Then was the Priory Church and Steeple, proffered to whomsoever would
take it down, and carry it from the ground, but no man would undertake the
offer; whereupon, Sir, <HI>Thomas Audley</HI> was fain to be at more charges than
could be made of the Stones, Timber, Lead, Iron, &amp;c. For the Workmen,
with great labour, beginning at the top, loosed stone from stone, and threw
them down, whereby the most part of them were broken, and few remained
whole, &amp; those were sold very cheap; for all the buildings then made about the
City, were of Brick &amp; Timber; At that time any man in the City might have a
Cart-load of stone for paving brought to his door for <HI>6d.</HI> or <HI>7d.</HI> with the carriage.</P>
<P>The said <HI>Thomas,</HI> Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> builded and dwelt on this Priory during his
life, and dyed there in the year 1544, since which time, the said Priory came (by
Marriage of the Lord <HI>Audley's</HI> Daughter and Heir) unto <HI>Thomas</HI> Duke of <HI>Nor∣folk,</HI>
and was then called the <HI>Dukes-place.</HI> At this time the Inhabitants
dwelling &amp; abiding in the said <HI>Dukes-place</HI> became utterly destitute of any Pa∣rish
Church, for resorting to Gods Divine service, and the administration of
the blessed Sacraments; which in the time of their former zeal, the demolished
Priory, not only serv'd their use, but infinite numbers besides, resorted thither.
In which respect, the Parish Church of St. <HI>Katherine</HI> being so near, and standing
in the Coemitery or Church-yard of the late dissolved Priory of the <HI>Holy Trini∣ty,</HI>
whereby it was called Saint <HI>Katherine Christs-Church,</HI> they resorted thither
at the hours of Divine Service, and for the benefit of the blessed Sacraments,
whereby they became a burthen to the said Parish, yet well enough borne
withal, in regard of the benefit ensuing by them, so that they carried the re∣spect
of equal parishioners, exercising and accomplishing all duties there, even
as if it had been their own proper Parish.</P>
<P>The long continuance of them in this kind, although some much misliked,
and gladly would have compassed means for remedy thereof; yet their pow∣er
not stretching so far, nor the way (as yet) fitting for their purpose, they re∣mained
contented against their Wills, till time would fit them with more con∣venient
opportunity; Ground they wanted not, for raising a sufficient Parish
Church to themselves, neither did any good will fail in them for the effecting
their purpose; but only were curbed by the lack of strength, how and which
way to bring it about. At length perceiving their ground (intended for so good
a use to themselves) aimed at for buildings to private mens benefits, that so
they might be frustrate of any such help, when occasion should in better man∣ner
shine on them, some of the best advised among them, by Petition solicited
the Lord Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to make their desire and intention known
to the King, which he did. And the King, finding the case so truly honest and
religious, for new erecting a Church where such necessity required, and where
Superstition had so long time formerly been harboured, not only gave the Lord
Archbishop and the Suitors, both thanks and commendation, but also under his
Hand and broad Seal, authorizable Warrant for their proceeding. The Lord
Mayor and Senate of Aldermen, having intelligence in the case, and perceiving
what an honour would redound thereby, first to God who inspired them there∣to;
next to the King, for so Royally granting the suite; and then to the City,
<PB N="55" REF="37"/>
for furthering it to Effect, notwithstanding that divers oppositions were made by
them, who would have things still continue, as formerly they did without bene∣fit
of a Parish Church of their own. It proceeded on with good &amp; prosperous suc∣cess,
to the no mean Honour, and commendation of the Lord Maior then being,
Sir <HI>Ed. Barkham</HI> by name, the Court of Aldermen, and state of this famous City
by whose good meanes it is made a very beautiful and comely Parish Church, it
being called in the time of re-edifying, <HI>Trinity Christs Church,</HI> raised out of the
long decayed ruines, of <HI>Trinity Priory</HI> in the <HI>Dukes place.</HI></P>
<P>By this time, the work is grown to such fulness and perfection, as now no∣thing
wanteth, but the windows glazing, which was performed in this
manner,</P>
<P>The main and great East light in the Chancel, Sir <HI>Edward Barkham</HI> himself
undertook, and effected it at his own Charge, as the expression testifieth in
the same Window. The other sideling by it; but inclining more Southerly.
Mr. <HI>George Whitmore,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nicholas Rainton,</HI> performed. And the third,
standing Northerly in the same Chancel, Mr. <HI>Walter Leigh,</HI> who had bin a Ser∣jeant
at Arms, to the Kings Majesty, and then Sword-bearer of <HI>London,</HI> did
likewise at his own Charge perform, The two Western lights in the bottom of
the Church, being (indeed) very fair lights; the Company of <HI>Drapers</HI> effected
the one, and the <HI>Wood-mongers</HI> Society finished the other. Beside, the two Sou∣therly
Windows, the one done at the charge of Mr. <HI>Cornelius Fish,</HI> Chamberlain
of <HI>London;</HI> and the other by Mr. <HI>Waldron,</HI> then Marshal: so now ye have the
Church of St. <HI>Iames</HI> compleat.</P>
<P>The Parish Church of St. <HI>Katherine,</HI> standeth in the Caemitery of the dis∣solved
Priory of the holy Trinity, and is therefore called St. <HI>Katherine</HI> Christs
Church. The Church seemeth to be very old, since the building whereof, the
High street hath bin so often raised by Pavements, that now men are sain to de∣scend
into the said Church, by divers steps, seven in number; but the Steeple,
or Bell Tower thereof, hath bin lately builded, to wit, about the year 1504.</P>
<P>For Sir <HI>Iohn Perceival</HI> Marchant-Tailor, then deceasing, gave money towards
the building thereof.</P>
<P>Now concerning this Parish Church of St. <HI>Katherine</HI> Christs Church, com∣monly
<HI>Cree-Church,</HI> as formerly hath bin said, it had a descent down into it by
seven steps or stayers; but being now newly built, and made a very fair Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch:
the ascent into the Church, is by four or five degrees.</P>
<P>At the North-West corner of this Ward, in the said High street, standeth the
fair and beautiful Parish Church of St. <HI>Andrew the Apostle,</HI> with an Addition,
to be known from other Churches of that Name, of the <HI>Knape,</HI> or <HI>Undershaft</HI>
and so called St. <HI>Andrew Undershaft:</HI> because that of old time, every year (on
<HI>May-day</HI> in the morning) it was used, that an high or long shaft, or May-pole,
was set up there, in the midst of the street, before the South door of the said
Church, which Shaft or Pole, when it was set on end, and fixed in the ground,
was higher then the Church Steeple. <HI>Jeffrey Chawcer,</HI> writing of a vain boaster,
hath these words, meaning of the said Shaft.
<Q><L>Right well aloft, and high ye bear your head,</L>
<L>The Weather-Cock, with flying, as ye would kill,</L>
<L>When ye be stuffed, bet of Wine, than bread,</L>
<L>Then look ye, when your wombe doth fill,</L>
<L>As ye would bear the great Shaft of <HI>Corn-hill.</HI></L>
<L>Lord so merrily, crowdeth then your Croke,</L>
<L>That all the Street may bear your Body Cloke.</L></Q></P>
<P>This <HI>Shaft</HI> was not raised any time since evil <HI>May-day</HI> (so called of an in∣surrection
made by Prentices, and other young persons against <HI>Aliens,</HI> in the
<PB N="56" REF="38"/>
year 1517.) but the said <HI>Shaft</HI> was laid along over the doors, and under the
Pentises of one rowe of Houses, and Alley-gate, called of the Shaft, <HI>Shaft-Al∣ley,</HI>
(being of the possessions of <HI>Rochester-bridge)</HI> in the Ward of
<HI>Limestreet.</HI></P>
<P>It was there I say, hanged on Iron hooks many years, till the third of King
<HI>Edward</HI> the sixth That one Sir <HI>Steven,</HI> Curate of St. <HI>Katherine Christs Church,</HI>
preaching at <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse, said there, that this <HI>Shaft</HI> was made an Idoll, by
naming the Church of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> with the addition of <HI>Under-shaft;</HI> he perswa∣ded
therefore, that the names of Churches might be altered: Also, that the
names of the dayes in the week, might be changed, the <HI>Fish dayes</HI> to be kept
any dayes, except Friday and Saturday; and the <HI>Lent</HI> any time, save only be∣twixt
<HI>Shrovetide</HI> and <HI>Easter:</HI> This man forsaking the Pulpit of his said Parish
Church, would preach out of an high Elm Tree, in the midst of the Church∣yard,
And then entring the Church, forsaking the Altar, to have sung his High
Masse in <HI>English▪</HI> upon a Tomb of the Dead, towards the North; But his Ser∣mon
at <HI>Pauls Crosse,</HI> took such effect, that in the Afternoon of that present
Sunday, the Neighbors and Tenants to the said Bridge, over whose doors, the
said Shaft had lain, after they had dined (to make themselves strong) gathered
more help, and with great labor, raising the Shaft from the Hooks (whereon
it had rested two and thirty years) they sawed it in pieces, every man taking for
his share, so much as had lain over his door and stall, the length of his house;
and they of the Alley divided amongst them, so much as had lain over their
Alley gate. Thus was his <HI>Idoll</HI> (as he termed it) mangled, and after bur∣ned.</P>
<P>Soon after, was there a commotion of the Commons in <HI>Norfolk, Suffolk,
Essex,</HI> and other Shires, by means whereof, streight Orders being taken for the
suppression of rumors, divers persons were apprehended, and executed by
<HI>Marshal</HI> Law; amongst the which, the Bayliffe of <HI>Rumford</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> was one,
a man very well beloved: he was early in the morning of <HI>Mary Magdalens</HI> day
(then kept Holy-day) brought by the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> and the Knight-Mar∣shall,
to the Well within <HI>Aldgate,</HI> there to be executed upon a Gibbit, set up
that morning, where being on the Ladder, he had words to this effect;</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood People, I am come hither to die, but know not for what offence, ex∣cept
for words by me spoken yester night to Sir <HI>Stephen,</HI> Curate and Preacher
of this Parish, which were these, He asked me what newes in the Country, I
answered, Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y newes; why quoth he? It is said, quoth I, that many men
be up in <HI>Essex;</HI> But thanks be to God, all is in good quiet about us; and
this was all, as God be my Iudge, &amp;c. <HI>Thus much, by the By.</HI></P>
<P>Now again, to the Parish Church of St. <HI>Andrew Under Shaft,</HI> for it still retain∣eth
the name, which hath bin new builded by the Parishioners, since the year
1520. every man putting to his helping hand, some with their purses, others
with their Bodies. <HI>Stephen Iennings</HI> Marchant-Taylor, sometimes Mayor of
<HI>London,</HI> caused (at his charges) to be builded the whole North side of the great
middle Ile, both of the Body and Quire, as appeareth by his Arms, over every
Pillar graven; and also the North Ile, which he roofed with Timber, and see∣led.
Also the whole South side of the Church, was glazed, and the Pewes in the
South Chappel made of his Costs, as appeareth in every Window, and upon
the said Pewes. He deceased in the year 1524. and was buried in the <HI>Grey
Fryers</HI> Church. <HI>John Kirby</HI> Marchant-Taylor, sometimes one of the Sheriffs,
<HI>John Garland</HI> Marchant-Taylor, and <HI>Nicholas Levison</HI> Mercer, Executor to <HI>Gar∣land,</HI>
were great Benefactors to this work, which was finished (to the glazing)
in the year 1529. and fully finished 1532.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="38"/>
Now in the second way from <HI>Aldgate,</HI> more toward the South, from the
Well or Pump aforesaid, sieth <HI>Fenne</HI>-Church street; on the right hand where∣of,
somewhat West from the South end of <HI>Belzetters</HI> lane, is <HI>Ironmongers-Hall,</HI>
which Company was incorporated in the third of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Richard
Flemming</HI> was their first Master, <HI>Nicholas Marshall,</HI> and <HI>Richard Cox,</HI> were
Custodes or Wardens. And on the left hand, or South side, (even by the Gate
and Wall of the City) runneth down a Lane to the Tower-Hill: the South
part whereof, is called <HI>Woodroof-Lane;</HI> and out of this Lane toward the West,
a street called <HI>Hart-street.</HI> In this street, at the South-East Corner thereof;
sometime stood one house of <HI>Crowched</HI> or <HI>(Crossed)</HI> Fryers, founded by <HI>Ralph
Hosier,</HI> and <HI>William Sabernes,</HI> about the year 1298. <HI>Stephen</HI> the tenth Prior of
the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> granted three Tenements for 13 s. 8 d. by the year,
unto the said <HI>Ralph Hosiar,</HI> and <HI>William Saburnes,</HI> who afterwards became
Fryers of S. <HI>Crosse. Adam</HI> was the first Prior of that house: These Fryers foun∣ded
their house in the place of certain Tenements, purchased of <HI>Rich. Wim∣blush,</HI>
the 12th Prior of the Holy Trinity, in the year 1319. which was confirm∣ed
by <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the seventeenth of his Raign, valued at 52 l. 13 s. 4 d.
surrendred the 12th of Novemb, the 30. of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th.</P>
<P>In place of this Church, is now a Carpenters yard, a Tennis-Court, and such
like: the Fryers Hall was made a Glasse-house, or house, wherein was made
Glasse of divers sorts to drink in: which house, in the year 1575. on the fourth
of September, burst out into a terrible fire, where all meanes possible being
practised to quench it, notwithstanding, as the same house in a small time be∣fore,
had consumed a great quantity of Wood, by making of Glasses; Now it
self, having within it about 40000 Billets of Wood, was also consumed to the
stone walls, which nevertheless, greatly, hindred the fire from spreading any
further.</P>
<P>Adjoyning unto this Fryers Church, by the East end thereof in Woodroffe
Lane, towards the Tower-Hill, are certain Almes-houses, 14. in number, buil∣ded
of Brick and Timber, founded by Sir <HI>John Milburn,</HI> Draper, sometime
Maior, 1521. wherein be placed 13. aged poor men, and their Wives: these
have their dwellings rent-free, and 2 s. 4 d. a peece, the first day of every
Moneth for ever.</P>
<P>Next to these Alms-houses is the Lord <HI>Lumleys</HI> house, builded in the time
of King <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> by Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat</HI> the Father, upon one plot of
ground, of late pertaining to the aforesaid <HI>Crossed Fryers,</HI> where part of their
house stood. And this is the farthest of <HI>Aldgate</HI> VVard toward the South,
and joyneth to the Tower-Hill; the other side of that Lane, over against the
Lord <HI>Lumleys</HI> house, on the wall side of the City, is now for the most part (or
altogether) builded, even to <HI>Aldgate.</HI></P>
<P>Then have ye on the South side of <HI>Fenne</HI>-Church-street, over against the
wall or Pump, amongst other fair and large builded houses, one that sometime
belonged to the <HI>Prior of Monte Joves,</HI> or <HI>Monastarie Cornute,</HI> a Cell to <HI>Monte
Joves</HI> beyond the Seas; in <HI>Essex</HI> it was the <HI>Priors</HI> Inne, when he repaired to
this City; Then a Lane that leadeth down by <HI>Northumberland</HI> House, to∣wards
the Crossed Fryers, as is afore shewed.</P>
<P>This <HI>Northumberland</HI> House in the Parish of St. <HI>Katherine Coleman,</HI> belong∣ing
to <HI>Henry Percy,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> in the 33. of <HI>Henrie</HI> the sixth; but
of late being left by the Earls, the Gardens thereof were made into Bowling
Alleys, and other parts into Dicing-houses, common to all commers, for their
money, there to bowl &amp; recreate themselves. But now of late, so many Bowling
Alleys, and other houses for unlawful gaming, have been raised in other parts
of the City and Subburbs, that this which was used to be the ancientest, and
only Rendezvouz of sport, is left and forsaken of the Gamesters, and therefore
<PB N="58" REF="39"/>
turned into a number of great Rents, small Cottages, for strangers and
others.</P>
<P>At the East end of this Lane, in the way from <HI>Aldgate,</HI> toward the <HI>Crossed
Friers,</HI> of old time, were certain Tenements, called the <HI>Poor Jurie,</HI> of Jewes
dwelling there.</P>
<P>Next unto this <HI>Northumberland</HI> house, is the Parish Church of St. <HI>Katherine,</HI>
called <HI>Coleman;</HI> which addition of <HI>Coleman,</HI> was taken of a great Haw-yard,
or Garden, of old time called <HI>Coleman Haw,</HI> in the Parish of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> now
called <HI>Christs Church.</HI> And in the Parish of St. <HI>Katherine,</HI> and All-saints, called
<HI>Coleman Church.</HI> There are some handsome Tombs in this Church, and parti∣cularly
of Sir <HI>Henry Billingley</HI> Knight, and Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> who was a
Benefactor thereunto.</P>
<P>Then have ye <HI>Blanch Appleton,</HI> whereof we read in the <HI>13th</HI> of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first,
that a Lane behind the same <HI>Blanch Appleton,</HI> was granted by the King to be in∣closed,

<P>WE will now give a visit to <HI>Limestreet</HI> Ward, which takes its denomi∣nation
from the street, and the street from making <HI>Lime</HI> there, in times
passed.</P>
<P>In <HI>Limestreet</HI> are divers fair Houses; for Marchants and others, there was
sometime a Mansion house of the <HI>Kings,</HI> called the <HI>Kings</HI> Artirce, as it stands
upon Record, in the <HI>14th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; but now grown out of know∣ledge:
We read also of another great House, in the West side of <HI>Limestreet,</HI> ha∣ving
a Chappel on the South, and a Garden on the West, belonging to the
Lord <HI>Nevill,</HI> which Garden is now called <HI>Green Yard,</HI> of the Leaden

<P>This House in the <HI>9th</HI> of <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. pertained to Sir <HI>Simon Burley,</HI> and Sir <HI>John

thereof new builded of Timber, by <HI>Hugh Offley,</HI> Alderman.</P>
<P>At the North-west Corner of <HI>Limestreet,</HI> was (of old time) one great Me∣suage,
called <HI>Benbridges Inne; Raph Holland,</HI> Draper, about the year 1452.
gave it to <HI>John Gill,</HI> Master, and to the VVardens and Fraternity of Taylors, and
Linnen Armourers of St. <HI>John Baptist</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and to their successors for
ever. They did set up in places thereof, a fair large frame of Timber, contain∣ing
in the high street, one great house; and before it, to the corner of <HI>Limestreet</HI>
three other Tenements, the corner house being the largest; and then down
<HI>Limestreet,</HI> divers handsome Tenements: All which, the Marchant-Taylors,

it up in money, three hundred sixty six pounds, thirteen shillings four pence:

This worthy man, and the Gentlewoman his Widow, after him, kept those
houses down <HI>Limestreet,</HI> in good reparations, never put out but one Tenant,
took no fines, nor raised rents for them, which was ten shillings the piece year∣ly;
But whether that favour did over-live her Funeral, the Tenants now can
best declare the contrary.</P>

<P>Moreover, in the year 1380. <HI>Alice Nevil,</HI> Widow to Sir <HI>Iohn Nevil,</HI> Knight
of <HI>Essex,</HI> confirmed to <HI>Thomas Cogshall,</HI> and others, the said Mannor of <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI>
and the advousions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1384. <HI>Humphrey de Bohun,</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> had the said Mannor,
And in the year 1408. <HI>Robert Rikeden</HI> of <HI>Essex,</HI> and <HI>Margaret</HI> his Wife, con∣firmed
to <HI>Richard Whittington,</HI> and other Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> the said Mannor
of <HI>Leaden Hall,</HI> with the Appurtenances, the Advousion of St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church,
S. <HI>Margaret Pattens,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And in the year 141<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. the said <HI>Whitington,</HI> and other, confirmed the same to
the Maior, and Comminalty of <HI>London,</HI> whereby it came to the possession of the
City.</P>
<P>Then in the year 1443. the one and twenty of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>Iohn Hatheyr¦ley,</HI>
Maior, purchased Licence of the said King, to take up 200. fodder of Lead,
for the building of Water Conduits, a common Granary, and the Crosse in
West Cheape, more richly, for the honour of the City.</P>
<P>In the year next following, the Parson and Parish of St. <HI>Dunstane,</HI> in the East of
<HI>London,</HI> seeing the Noble and mighty Man (for the words be in the Grant; <HI>Cùm
Nobilis &amp; Potens vir.) Simon Eyre,</HI> Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> among other his works of
piety, effectually determined to erect &amp; build a certain Granary, upon the soil of
the same City at <HI>Leaden Hall,</HI> of his own charges, for the common utility of the
said City, to the amplifying and inlarging of the said Granary, granted to <HI>Henry
Frowick,</HI> then Maior, the Aldermen and Commonalty, and their Successors for
ever, all their Tenements, with the appurtenances, sometime called the <HI>Horse
Mill</HI> in <HI>Grasse-street,</HI> for the annual Rent of four pounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Also, certain evidences of an Alley, and Tenements pertaining to the
<HI>Horse Mill,</HI> adjoyning to the said <HI>Leaden Hall</HI> in <HI>Grasse-street,</HI> given by <HI>VVilliam
Kingstone,</HI> Fishmonger, unto the Parish Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> upon <HI>Cornhill,</HI> do
specifie the said Granary, to be builded by the said Honourable and famous
Marchant, <HI>Simon Eyre,</HI> sometime an Upholster, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen a Draper, in the year
1419. He builded it of squared stone, in form as now it sheweth, with a
fair and large Chappel in the East side of the Quadrant; over the Porch of
which, he caused to be written, <HI>Dextra Domini exaltavit me,</HI> The Lords right
hand exalted me.</P>
<P>Within the said Church, on the North wall, was written, <HI>Honorandus famo∣sus
Mercator Simon Eyre, hujus operis, &amp;c.</HI> In English thus, The honourable
and famous Marchant <HI>Simon Eyre,</HI> founder of this work, once Maior of this
City, Citizen and Draper of the same, departed out of this life, the <HI>18th</HI> day
of Septemb. the year from the Incarnation of Christ, 1459. and the 38. year
of the Raign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth: he was buried in the Parish Church of St.
<HI>Mary Wolnoth,</HI> in <HI>Lumbard street;</HI> he gave by his Testament, to be distribu∣ted
to all Prisons in <HI>London,</HI> or within a mile of that City, somewhat, to relieve
them.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="40"/>
More, he gave 2000 Marks upon a condition, which not performed, was
then to be distributed to Maids Marriages, and other deeds of Charity: he also
gave 3000 Marks to the Drapers, upon condition, that they should within one
year after his decease, establish perpetually a Master or Warden, five secular
Priests, six Clerks, and two Queristers, to sing daily Divine Service, by note for
ever, in this Chappel of the <HI>Leaden-hall;</HI> Also, one Master with an Usher for
Grammar, one Master for Writing, and the third for Song, with Houses there
newly builded for them for ever; the Master to have for his salary, ten pounds,
and every other Priest, eight pounds; every other Clarke, five pounds six shil∣lings
eight pence; and every other Chorister, five Marks; and if the Drapers
refused this to do, within one year after his decease, then the three thousand
Marks to remain to the Prior and Covent of <HI>Christs-Church</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> with con∣dition
to establish things as aforesaid, within two years after his decease; And
if they refused, then the three thousand Marks to be disposed by his Executors,
as they best could devise in works of Charity.</P>
<P>Thus much for his Testament, not performed by establishing of Divine
Service in his Chappel or Free-School, and Scholars; neither was it known how
the stock of three thousand Marks (or rather five thousand Marks) was employ∣ed
by his Executors, he left issue <HI>Thomas,</HI> who had issue <HI>Thomas, &amp;c.</HI> True it is,
that in the year 1464, the third of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, it was agreed by the May∣or,
Aldermen, and Commonalty of <HI>London,</HI> that notwithstanding the Kings
Letters Pattents, lately before granted unto them, touching the <HI>Trouage or
weighing of Wares,</HI> to be held at <HI>Leaden-hall;</HI> yet Suite should be made to the
King, for new Letters Pattents, to be granted to the Mayor of the Staple, for the
<HI>Trouage of Wools,</HI> to be holden there, and order to be taken by the discretion of
<HI>Thomas Cooke,</HI> then Mayor; The Councel of the City, <HI>Geffrey filding,</HI> then May∣or
of the Staple at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and of the Kings Councel what should be paid
to the Mayor, and Aldermen of the City, for the laying and housing of the
Wools there, that so they might be brought forth and weighed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the Chappel there, we find that in the year 1466, by Licence ob∣tained
of King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, in the sixth of his Reign, a Fraternity of the
Trinity of 60 Priests (besides other brethren and sisters) in the same Chappel, was
founded by <HI>Rouse, Iohn Risby,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Ashby</HI> Priests: some of the which six∣ty
Priests, every Market-day, in the fore-noon, did celebrate Divine service
there, to such Market people as repaired to prayer, and once every year, they
met altogether, and had solemn Service, with procession of all the Brethren,
and Sisters; this foundation was in the year 1512, by a Common-Councel con∣firmed
to the sixty Trinity Priests, and to their Successors, at the will of the
Mayor and Commonalty.</P>
<P>In the year 1484 a great fire happened upon <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> by what casualty
it was not known, but much housing was there destroyed, with all the Stocks
for Guns, and other provision belonging to the City, which was a great losse,
and no lesse charge to be repaired by them.</P>
<P>In the year 1503. the eighteenth of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, a request was made
by the Commons of the City, concerning the usage of the said <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI>
in form as followeth;</P>
<P><Q>Please it the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Councel, to enact,
that all Frenchmen bringing Canvas, Linnen cloth, and other Wares to be
sold, and all Forreins bringing Woolsteads, Sayes, Stamins, Kiverings, Nayles,
Iron work, or any other Wares, and also all Forreins, bringing Lead to the
City to be sold, shall bring all such their Wares aforesaid, to the open Market
of the <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> and no where else to be shewed, sold and uttered, like as
of old time it hath been used, upon pain of forfeiture of all the said Wares,
shewed or sold in any other place than aforesaid; And the shew of the said
<PB N="61" REF="40"/>
Wares to be made three daies in a week, that is to lay <HI>Monday, Tuesday,</HI> and
<HI>Wednesday;</HI> It is also thought reasonable, that the common Beam be kept from
henceforth in the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> &amp; the Farmer to pay therefore reasonable rent to
the Chamber, for better it is, that the Chamber have advantage thereby, than
a Forreign person; And also the said <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> which is more chargeable
now by half than profitable, shall better bear out the charges thereof; Also
the common Beam for Wool at <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> may pay yearly a rent to the
Chamber of <HI>London,</HI> toward the supportation and charges of the same place:
for reason it is, that a common Office occupied upon a common ground,
bear a charge to the use of the Communalty; Also that Forrains bringing
Wools, Felts, or any other Marchandizes or Wares to <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> to be kept
there for the sale and market, may pay more largely for keeping of their goods,
than Freemen.</Q> Thus much for the request of the Commons at that time.</P>
<P>Now to set down some proof, that the said Hall hath been employed
and used as a Granary for Corn and grain (as the same was first appointed) lea∣ving
all former examples, this one may suffice, <HI>Roger Achley</HI> Mayor of <HI>London</HI>
in the year 1512, the third of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, when the said Mayor entred
the Majoralty, there was not found one hundred quarters of Wheat in all the
Garners of this City, either within the Liberties or near adjoyning, through
the which scarcity, when the Carts of <HI>Stratford</HI> came laden with Bread to the
City (as they had been accustomed) there was such press about them, that one
man was ready to destroy another, in striving to be served for their money; but
this scarcity lasted not long, for the Mayor (in short time) made such provisi∣on
for Wheat that the Bakers, both of <HI>London,</HI> and of <HI>Stratford,</HI> were weary of
taking it up, and were forced to take much more than they would, and for the
rest the Mayor laid out the money, and stored it up in <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> and other
Garners of the City; This Mayor also kept the Market so well, that he would
be at the <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> by four a clock in the Summer mornings, and
from thence he went to other Markets to the great comfort of the Citi∣zens.</P>
<P>We read also, that in the year 1528, the twentieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, Sur∣veyers
were appointed to view the Garners of the City, namely, the <HI>Bridge-house</HI>
and the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> how they were stored of Grain for the service of the City;
And because we have here before spoken of the Bread-carts coming from <HI>Strat∣ford</HI>
at the <HI>Bow,</HI> ye shall understand, that of old time the Bakers of Bread at
<HI>Stratford,</HI> were allowed to bring daily (except the Sabbath and principal Feasts)
divers long Carts laden with bread, the same being two ounces in the penny
wheaten loaf heavier than the penny wheaten loaf baked in the City, the same
to be sold in Cheap, three or four Carts standing there 'tween <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>therans</HI> Lane,
and <HI>Fausters</HI> Lane end, one Cart on <HI>Cornhil</HI> by the Conduit, and one other in
<HI>Grasse-street;</HI> And we may read, that in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second,
<HI>Richard Reffeham,</HI> being Mayor, a Baker named <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Stratford,</HI> for making
Bread lesser than the Assize, was with a fools hood on his Head, and loaves of
Bread about his Neck, drawn on a hurdle through the streets of the City▪
Moreover, in the four and fortieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Iohn Chichester</HI> being
Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> as we may read in the visions of <HI>Pierce Plowman,</HI> a Book so cal∣led
as followeth;</P>
<P>There was a careful commune, when no Cart came to Town with Basket
Bread from <HI>Stratford</HI> tho gan beggars weep, and workmen were agast, a little
this will be thought long in the date of our dirte, in a dry Averel, a thousand and
three hundred, twice thirty and ten, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We read also in the twentieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, Sir <HI>Iames Spencer</HI> being
Mayor, six Bakers of <HI>Stratford,</HI> were amerced in the <HI>Guild-hall</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> for ba∣king
<PB N="62" REF="41"/>
under the size appointed; But these Bakers of <HI>Stratford</HI> left serving this
City, I know not upon what occasion, above forty years since.</P>
<P>In the year 1519 a Petition was exhibited by the Commons to the Com∣mon-Councel,
and was by them allowed, concerning the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> how they
would have it used, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Meekly beseeching, sheweth unto your good Lordship, and Masterships,
divers Citizens of this City, which (under correction) think, that the great
place called the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> should, nor ought not to be letten out to Farme,
to any person or persons and in special, to any fellowship or Company incor∣porate,
to have and hold the same Hall for term of years; for such convenien∣ces
as thereby may ensue, and come to the hurt of the Common-weale of
the said City in time to come, as somewhat more largely may appear in the
Articles following.</Q></P>
<P><Q>First, if any assembly or hasty gathering of the Commons of the said City,
for suppressing or subduing of mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruled people within the said City, hereafter
shall happen to be called or commanded by the Mayor, Aldermen, and other
Governours and Councellors of the said City for the time being; there is
none so convenient, meet and necessary a place to assemble them in, within
the said City, as the said <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> both for largenesse of room, and for their
sure defence in time of their counselling together about the premises. Also,
in that place hath been used the Artillery, Guns, and other Armors of the
said City, to be safely kept in a readinesse, for the safegard, wealth, and defence
of the said City to be had and occupied at times when need required. As also
the store of Timber, for the necessary reparations of the Tenements be∣longing
to the Chamber of the said City, there commonly hath been
kept.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Item,</HI> If any Triumph or Noblenesse were to be done, or shewed by the
Commonalty of the City, for the honour of our Soveraign Lord the King and
Realm, and for the worship of the said City, the said <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> is the most
meet and convenient place, to prepare and order the said Triumph therein,
and from thence to issue forth to the places thereof appointed.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Item,</HI> at any Largesse or dole of any money, made unto the poore people of
this City; it hath been used to be done and given in the said <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> for
that the said place is most meet therefore.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Item,</HI> the honourable Father, that was maker of the said Hall, had a speci∣all
will, intent, and mind, that (as it is commonly said) the Market men
and women, that came to the City with victuals and other things, should have
their free standing within the said <HI>Leaden-Hall</HI> in wet weather, to keep
themselves &amp; their Wares dry, and thereby to encourage them, and all other,
to have the better will and desire, the more plentiously to resort to the said
City, to victual the same; And if the said Hall should be letten to Farme,
the will of the said honourable Father, should never be fullfilled, nor take
effect.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Item,</HI> if the said place, which is the chief Fortresse, and most necessary place
within all the City, for the tuition and safegard of the same, should be letten
out to Farme, out of the hands of the chief Heads of the same City, and espe∣cially
to any other Body politick, it might at length (by likelihood) be an
occasion of discord and debate, between the said Bodies politick, which
God defend.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For these, and many other great and reasonable causes, which hereafter
shall be shewed to this honourable Court, your said Beseechers think it much
necessary, that the said Hall be still in the hands of this City; and to be
surely kept by sad and discreet Officers in such wise, that it might alwaies be
ready to be used and occupied, for the Common-weale of the said City, when
<PB N="63" REF="41"/>
need shall require, and in no wise to be letten to any Body politick.</Q>
Thus much for the Petition.</P>
<P>About the year one thousand five hundred thirty four, great means was
made about the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> to have the same made a Burse for the Assembly of
Marchants, as they had been accustomed in <HI>Lumbard-street;</HI> many Common-Councels
were called to that end, but in the year 1535, <HI>Iohn Champneys</HI> being
Mayor, it was fully concluded, that the Burse should remain in <HI>Lumbard-street,</HI>
as afore, and <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> no more to be spoken of concerning that matter.</P>
<P>The use of <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> was us'd to be thus; In a part of the North Quadrant,
on the East side of the North Gate, were the common Beams, for weigh∣ing
of Wooll and other Wares, as had been accustomed; On the West side of▪
the Gate was the Scales to weigh Meal: the other three sides were reserved (for
the most part) to the making and resting of the Pageants shewed at Mid-Sum∣mer
in the watch: the remnant of the sides and Quadrants, were employed
for the stowage of Wool-sacks, but not closed up: the lofts above were partly
used by the Painters, in working for the decking of Pageants and other devices,
for beautifying of the Watch and Watch-men: the residue of the Lofts were
letten out to Marchants, the Wooll-winders and Packers therein, to winde
and pack their Wools. And thus much for <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> may suffice.</P>
<P>Now on the North of <HI>Limestreet</HI> Ward, in the Highstreet are divers fair hou∣ses
for Marchants, and proper Tenements for Artificers, with an Alley also cal∣led
<HI>Shalt Alley,</HI> of the Shaft or May-pole, sometime resting over the Gate
thereof, as I have declared in <HI>Aldgate Ward.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1576. partly at the charges of the Parish of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> and part∣ly
at the charges of the Chamber of <HI>London,</HI> a water-pump, was raysed in the
high street of <HI>Lime-street Ward,</HI> neer unto <HI>Lime-street</HI> corner, for the placing of
the which Pump, having broken up the ground, they were forced to dig more
than two fadome deep, before they came to any main ground, where they found
a Hearth made of <HI>Britaine,</HI> or rather <HI>Romane</HI> Tyle, every Tyle half yard square,
and about two inches thick, they found coal lying there also (for that lying
whole will never consume) then digging one fadome in the main, they found
water sufficient, made their Prall, and set up the Pump, which Pump, with oft
repairing and great charges to the Parish, continued not four and twenty years,
but being rotted, was taken up, and a new one set in the place, in the year 1600.
Thus much for the High-street.</P>
<P>In Saint <HI>Mary</HI> street had ye (of old time) a Parish Church of Saint <HI>Mary</HI> a
Virgin, Saint <HI>Ursula,</HI> and the 11000 Virgins, which Church was commonly
called Saint <HI>Mary at the Axe,</HI> of the Signe of an Axe, over against the East end
thereof, or Saint <HI>Mary Pellipar,</HI> of a plot of ground lying on the North side
thereof pertaining to the <HI>Skinners</HI> in <HI>London;</HI> This Parish about the year 1565.
was united to the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Andrew</HI> Under Shaft, and so was Saint
<HI>Mary at the Axe</HI> suppressed, and letten out to be a Ware-house for a Mar∣chant;
Against the East end of this Church, was sometime a fair Well, now
turned to a Pump; Also against the North end of this Saint <HI>Mary</HI> street, was,
sometime one other Parish Church of Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> called Saint <HI>Augustine</HI>
in the Wall, for that it stood adjoyning to the Wall of the City, and other∣wise
called Saint <HI>Augustines Papey,</HI> or the poor, as I have read, in the Reign
of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. About the year 1430, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth,
the same Church was allowed to the Brethren of the <HI>Papey,</HI> the House of <HI>poor
Priests,</HI> whereof I have spoken in <HI>Aldgate</HI> Ward, the Parishioners of this
Church were appointed to the Parish Church of <HI>Alhallowes</HI> in the Wall,
which is in <HI>Broad</HI> street Ward, and this Brotherhood called <HI>Papey,</HI> being
suppressed, the Church of Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> was pulled down, and in place
thereof one <HI>Grey</HI> Apothecary, builded a Stable, a Hay-lost, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is now a
<PB N="64" REF="42"/>
dwelling house, those two Parish Churches, both lying in the Ward of <HI>Lime-street;</HI>
being thus suppressed, there is not any one Parish Church or place for
Divine Service in that Ward, but the Inhabitants thereof repair to Saint
<HI>Peters</HI> in <HI>Cornhill</HI> Ward, Saint <HI>Andrew</HI> in <HI>Aldgate</HI> Ward, <HI>Alhallows in
the Wall in Broad-street</HI> Ward, and some to Saint <HI>Denys</HI> in <HI>Langbourne</HI>
Ward.</P>
<P>Now, because there hath been some question, to what Ward this Church
of Saint <HI>Augustine Papey</HI> should of right belong, for the same hath been chal∣lenged
by them of <HI>Aldgate</HI> Ward, and (without reason) taken into <HI>Bishops-gate</HI>
Ward, from <HI>Lime-street</HI> Ward, I am somewhat to touch it.</P>
<P>About 70 years since, the Chamber of <HI>London,</HI> granted a Lease of ground ly∣ing
near <HI>London</HI> Wall, in the Ward of <HI>Lime-street,</HI> from the West of the said
Church or Chappel of Saint <HI>Augustine Papey,</HI> towards <HI>Bishops-gate &amp;c.</HI> on the
which plot of ground, the Leasee builded three fair Tenements, and placed Te∣nants
there, these were charged to bear Scot and Lot, and some of them to bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Office in <HI>Lime street</HI> Ward, all which they did willingly without grudging;
And when any suspected or disordered persons were by the Landlord placed
there, the Officers of <HI>Lime street</HI> Ward, fetched them out of their Houses,
committed them to Ward, procured their due punishments, and banished
them from thence; whereby in short time that place was reformed, and
brought into good order, which thing being noted by them of <HI>Aldgate</HI> Ward,
they moved their Alderman, Sir <HI>Thomas Offley,</HI> to call in those Houses to be
of his Ward; But Mr. <HI>Stow</HI> producing a fair Ledgier Book, sometime pertain∣ing
to the late dissolved <HI>Priory</HI> of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> within <HI>Aldgate,</HI> wherein
were set down the just bounds of <HI>Aldgate</HI> Ward, before Sir <HI>Thomas Offley,</HI> Sir
<HI>Rowland Hayward,</HI> the Common-Councel, and Ward-Mote Inquest, of the
said <HI>Lime street</HI> Ward, Sir <HI>Thomas Offley</HI> gave over his Challenge, and so that
matter rested in good quiet, until the year 1579. that Sir <HI>Richard Pype</HI> (being
Mayor, and Alderman of <HI>Bishops-gate</HI> Ward) challenged those Houses to be
of his Ward, whereunto (without reason shewed) Sir <HI>Rowland Hayward</HI> yeil∣ded;
and thus is that side of the street from the North corner of Saint <HI>Mary</HI>
street, almost to <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> (wherein is one plot of ground, letten by
the Chamberlaine of London, to the Parish of Saint <HI>Martins Oteswich,</HI> to
be a Church-yard, or burying-place for the dead of that Parish, <HI>&amp;c.)</HI> un∣justly
drawn and with-holden from the Ward of <HI>Lime-street,</HI> as Master
<HI>Stow</HI> avoncheth.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Fifth Ward, or Aldermanry of
London, called Bishopsgate-Ward.</HEAD>
<P>THe Ward next in order is <HI>Bishopsgate-Ward,</HI> whereof a part is without the
Gate; and of the Subburbs, from the Barres by St. <HI>Mary Spittle,</HI> to <HI>Bi∣shopsgate,</HI>
and a part of <HI>Hounds-ditch,</HI> almost half thereof; also without
the Wall of the same Ward.</P>
<P>Then within the Gate is <HI>Bishopsgate-street,</HI> so called, of the Gate, to a Pump,
were sometime was a fair Well, with two Buckets, by the East end of the Pa∣rish
Church of St. <HI>Martin Oteswich,</HI> and then winding by the West corner of
<HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> down <HI>Grasse-street,</HI> to the corner over against <HI>Grasse-Church;</HI> and
these are the bounds of that Ward.</P>
<P>Monuments most to be noted, are these, The Parish-Church of St. <HI>Buttolph</HI> without <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> in a fair Church-yard adjoyning to the Town-Ditch, upon
the very Bank thereof; but of old time, inclosed with a comely Wall of Brick,
lately repaired by Sir <HI>William Allen,</HI> Mayor, in the year 1571, because he was
born in that Parish, where also he was buried.</P>
<P>An Anchoresse (by <HI>Bishopsgate)</HI> received forty shillings the year, of the She∣riffs
of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Next unto the Parish Church of St. <HI>Buttolph,</HI> was a fair Inne, for receipt of
Travellers, then an Hospital of St. <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Bethlem,</HI> founded by <HI>Simon Fitz
Mary,</HI> one of the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> in the year 1246. He founded it to have
been a <HI>Priory</HI> of Canons, with Brethren and Sisters; and King <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>3d,</HI>
granted a Protection, for the Brethren called <HI>Milites beatae Mariae de Bethlem;</HI>
within the City of <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>14th</HI> year of his Raign. It was an Hospital for
distracted people.</P>
<P><HI>Stephen Gennings,</HI> Marchant-Taylor, gave forty pounds toward purchase
of the Patronage, by his Testament, 1523. The Mayor and Commonalty pur∣chased
the Patronage thereof, with all the Lands and Tenements thereunto
belonging, in the year 1546.</P>
<P>Now it shall not be amisse, to insert here that memorable ancient deed of
gift, given to <HI>Bethelem,</HI> or <HI>Bedlam,</HI> by the foresaid <HI>Simon,</HI> the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> as fol∣loweth.</P>
<P><Q>To all the Children of our Mother holy Church, to whom this present wri∣ting

among other things, and before other Lands, the high Altitude of the Heaven∣ly
Councels, marvellously wrought by some readier devotion, it ought to be
more worshipped; of which things the mortal sickness (after the fall of our
first Father <HI>Adam)</HI> hath taken the beginning of this new repairing: there∣fore
forsooth, it beseemeth worthy, that the place, in which the Son of God
is become Man, and hath proceeded from the Virgins Womb, which is in∣creaser,
and beginning of Mans Redemption; namely, ought to be with Re∣verence
worshipped, and with beneficial Portions to be increased: therefore
it is, that the said <HI>Simon,</HI> Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> having special and singular Devotion
to the Church, of the glorious Virgin at <HI>Bethelem,</HI> where the same Virgin of
Her, brought forth our Saviour incarnate, and lying in the Cratch, and with
her own milk nourished; and where the same Child to us there born, the
Chivalry of the heavenly Company, sang the new Hymne, <HI>Gloria in Excelsis
Deo.</HI> The same time, the increaser of our health, (as a King, and his Mother a
Queen) willed to be worshipped of <HI>Kings,</HI> a new Starre going before them, as
the Honour and Reverence of the same Child, and his most meek Mother: And

to the exaltation of my most Noble Lord, <HI>Henry</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> whose Wife
and Child the foresaid Mother of God, and her only Son, have in their keep∣ing,
and protection; And to the manifold increase of this City of <HI>London,</HI> in
which I was born. And also for the health of my soul, and the souls of my
Predecessors, and Successors, my Father, Mother, and my Friends. And spe∣cially
for the souls of <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Marlow, Iohn Durant, Ralph Ashwye, Maud, Mar∣garet,</HI>
and <HI>Dennis,</HI> Women: Have given, granted, and by this my present
Charter, here, have confirmed to God, and to the Church of St. <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Be∣thelem,</HI>
all my Lands which I have in the Parish of St. <HI>Buttolph,</HI> without <HI>Bi∣shopsgate</HI>
of <HI>London,</HI> that is to say, whatsoever I there now have, or had, or in
time to come may have, in Houses, Gardens, Pools, Ponds, Ditches and Pits,
and all their appurtenances, as they be closed in by their bounds; which
now extend in length, from the <HI>Kings</HI> high street, East, to the great Ditch in
the West; the which is called deep Ditch; and in breadth, to the Lands of
<HI>Ralph Downing,</HI> in the North; and to the Land of the Church of St. <HI>Buttolph</HI>
in the South; To have and to hold the aforesaid Church of <HI>Bethelem,</HI> in fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and perpetual Alms; And also to make there a Priory, and to ordain a Prior,
and Canons; Brothers, and also Sisters, when Jesus Christ shall enlarge his
grace upon it. And in the same place, the Rule and order of the said Church
of <HI>Bethelem</HI> solemnly professing, which shall bear the Token of a Starre open∣ly
in their Coapes and Mantles of profession; and for to say Divine Service
there, for the souls aforesaid, and all Christian souls; and specially to receive
there, the Bishop of <HI>Bethelem,</HI> Canons, Brothers, and Messengers of the
Church of <HI>Bethelem</HI> for evermore, as often as they shall come thither. And
that a Church or Oratory there shall be builded, as soon as our Lord shall en∣large
his grace, under such form, that the Order, Institution of Priors, Ca∣nons,
Brothers, Sisters, of the visitation, correction, and reformation of the
said place, to the Bishop of <HI>Bethelem,</HI> and his Successors, and to the Charter of
his Church, and of his Messengers, as often as they shall come thither, as shall
seem them expedient; no mans contradiction notwithstanding; shall pertain
for evermore: saving alway the Services of the chief Lords, as much as per∣taineth
to the said Land. And to the more surety of this thing, I have put my
self out of this Land, and all mine. And Lord <HI>Godfrey,</HI> then chosen of the
Nobles of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bethelem,</HI> and of the Pope, confirmed
then by his name in <HI>England,</HI> in his name, and of his Successors, and of his
Chapter of his Church of <HI>Bethelem,</HI> into bodily possession, I have indented
and given to his possession all the foresaid Lands; which possession he hath re∣ceived,
and entred in form abovesaid.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And in token of subjection, and reverence, the said place in <HI>London,</HI> without
<HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> shall pay yearly in the said City, a mark <HI>sterling</HI> at <HI>Easter,</HI> to the Bi∣shop
of <HI>Bethelem,</HI> his Successors, or his Messengers, in the name of a Pension;
and if the faculties or goods of the said place (our Lord granting) happen to
grow more, the said place shall pay more, in the name of Pension, at the said
terme, to the Mother Church of <HI>Bethelem.</HI> This (forsooth) gift and confirma∣tion
of my Deed, and the putting to of my Seal for me, and mine Heires, I have
steadfastly made strong, the year of our Lord God, A thousand, two hun∣dred,

<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> gave this Hospital unto the City, The Church and Chap∣pel
were taken down in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and houses builded
there, by the Governours of <HI>Christs</HI> Hospital in <HI>London.</HI> In this place, people
that be distraught in their wits, are now (by the suit of their friends) received
and kept as before, but not without charges to their bringers in.</P>
<P>Then is there a fair House of late, builded by <HI>Iohn Powlet.</HI> Next to that,
a far more large and beautiful House, with Gardens of pleasure, Bowling Al∣lies,
and such like, builded by <HI>Iasper Fisher,</HI> free of the Goldsmiths, late one
<PB N="67" REF="43"/>
of the six-Clarks of the Chancery, and a Justice of Peace. It hath since (for a
time) been the Earl of <HI>Oxfords</HI> place. The late Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> hath lodged
there, it now belongeth to the Earl of <HI>Devonshire.</HI> This House being so large, and
sumptuously builded, by a man of no great Calling, Possessions, or VVealth;
(for he was indebted to many) was mockingly called <HI>Fishers folly,</HI> and a Rithme
was made of it, and other the like, in this manner.
<Q><L><HI>Kirbyes</HI> Castle, and <HI>Fishers</HI> Folly,</L>
<L><HI>Spinilas</HI> pleasure, and <HI>Megses</HI> glory.</L></Q></P>
<P>And so of other like Buildings about the City, by Citizens, men have not
forborn to speak their pleasure.</P>
<P>From <HI>Fishers</HI> Folly, up to the West end of <HI>Berwards</HI> Lane, of old time so
called; but now <HI>Hogge-Lane,</HI> because it meeteth with <HI>Hogge-Lane,</HI> which
commeth from the Barres without <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> as is afore shewed, is a continual
bnilding of Tenements, with Allies of Cottages, pestered, &amp;c. Then is there
a large close, called <HI>Fazel</HI> Close, sometime, for that there were <HI>Zazels</HI> planted
for the use of <HI>Cloth-workers,</HI> since letten to the <HI>Crosse-bow</HI> Makers, wherein they
used to shoot for Games at the <HI>Popingey.</HI> Now the same being inclosed with a
Brick-wall, serveth to be an Artillery-yard, or Garden, whereunto the Gun∣ners
of the Tower, weekly do repair; namely, every <HI>Thursday,</HI> and their le∣velling
certain B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asse-Pieces of great Artillery against a But of Earth, made for
that purpose; they discharged them for their exercise, present use is made
thereof by divers worthy Citizens, Gentlemen, and Captains, using Marshal
Discipline, and where they meet (well-neere) weekly, to their great commen∣dation,
in so worthy an Exercise, whereof hereafter, I will speak more at
large.</P>
<P>Then have ye the late dissolved <HI>Priory</HI> and Hospital, commonly called, <HI>Saint
Mary Spittle,</HI> founded by <HI>Walter Brune,</HI> and <HI>Rosia</HI> his Wife, for Canons regu∣lar,
<HI>VValter,</HI> Arch Deacon of <HI>London,</HI> laid the first stone in the year 1197. <HI>VVil∣liam</HI>
of St. <HI>Mary Church,</HI> then Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> dedicated it to the honour of
<HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and his <HI>Mother,</HI> the perpetual Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> by the name of <HI>Domus
De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Beatae Mariae, Extra Bishopsgate,</HI> in the Parish of St. <HI>Buttolph,</HI> the
bounds whereof, as appeareth by composition between the Parson, and <HI>Prior</HI>
of the said Hospital; concerning Tithes, beginning at <HI>Berwards</HI> Line, towards
the South, and extendeth in breadth to the Parish of St. <HI>Leonard</HI> of <HI>Sores-ditch,</HI>
towards the North; and in length, from the <HI>Kings street</HI> on the West, to the
<HI>Bishops of Londons</HI> field, called <HI>Lollesworth</HI> on the East.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prior</HI> of this St. <HI>Mary Spittle,</HI> for the immortising and propriation of
the Priory of <HI>Bikenacar</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> to his said house of St. <HI>Mary Spittle,</HI> gave to
<HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>7<SUP>th</SUP>,</HI> four hundred pounds, in the two and twentieth of his
Raign.</P>
<P>This Hospital surrendred to <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> was valued to dispend four hun∣dred
seventy eight pounds <HI>per annu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> wherein was found, besides Ornaments
of the Church, and other goods pertaining to the Hospital, one hundred
eighty beds well furnished, for receipt of the poor; for it was an Hospital of
great relief. Sir <HI>Henry Plesington</HI> Knight, was buried there, one thousand four
hundred fifty and two.</P>
<P>And here is to be noted, that time out of minde, it hath been a laudable Cu∣stome,
that on good Friday in the After-noon, some especial learned man, by
appointment of the <HI>Prelates,</HI> should preach a Sermon at <HI>Pauls Crosse,</HI> treating
of Christs passion▪ and upon the three next Easter Holydayes, Munday, Tues∣day,
and Wednesday, the like learned men, by the like appointment, have u∣sed
to preach on the forenoons at the said <HI>Spittle,</HI> to perswade the Article of
Christs Resurrection; and then on Low Sunday, one other learned man at
<PB N="68" REF="44"/>
<HI>Pauls Crosse,</HI> to make rehearsal of those four former Sermons, either commen∣ding,
or reproving them, as to him (by judgement of the learned Divines) was
thought convenient; And that done, he was to make a studied Sermon of his
own, which in all, were five Sermons in one; At these Sermons so severally
preached, the Maior with his Brethren the Aldermen, were accustomed to be
present in their Violets at <HI>Pauls,</HI> on good <HI>Friday,</HI> and in their Scarlets at the
<HI>Spittle,</HI> in the Holydayes (except <HI>VVednesday,</HI> in Violet) and the Maior with his
Brethren on <HI>Low Sunday</HI> in Scarlet, at <HI>Pauls Crosse.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the Antiquity of this Custom, I finde, that in the year one thou∣sand
three hundred ninety eight, King <HI>Richard</HI> having procured from <HI>Rome,</HI>
confirmation of such Statutes, and Ordinances, as were made in the Parliament
begun at <HI>VVestminster,</HI> and ended at <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> he caused the same confirma∣tion
to be read, and pronounced at <HI>Pauls Crosse,</HI> and at St. <HI>Mary Spittle,</HI> in a
Sermon before all the People.</P>
<P><HI>Philip Malpas,</HI> one of the Sheriffs, in the year, one thousand four hundred
thirty nine, gave twenty shillings by the year, to the three Preachers at the
<HI>Spittle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stephen Foster</HI> Maior, in the year, 1594. gave 40 l. to the Preachers of <HI>Pauls
Crosse</HI> and <HI>Spittle.</HI> We find also, that the aforesaid House, wherein the Maior,
and Aldermen do sit at the Spittle, was builded (for that purpose) of the
goods, and by the Executors of <HI>Richard Rawson,</HI> Alderman, and <HI>Isabel</HI> his
Wife, in the year 1488.</P>
<P>In the year 1594. this Pulpit being old, was taken down, and a new one set
up: the Preachers face turned towards the South, which was before towards
the West. Also a large House (on the East side of the said Pulpit) was then
builded, for the Governours and Children of <HI>Christs Hospital</HI> to sit in; and this
was done of the goods of <HI>William Elkin,</HI> Alderman before deceased; But with∣in
the first year, the same House decaying, and like to have fallen, was again
(with great cost) repaired at the Cities Charge.</P>
<P>On the East side of this Church-yard, lyeth a large field, of old time called
<HI>Lolesworth,</HI> now <HI>Spittle-field,</HI> which about the year, 1576. was broken up, for
Clay to make Brick: in the digging thereof, many Earthen Pots called <HI>Urnae,</HI>
were found full of Ashes, with burnt bones of men, to wit, of the Romans
that inhabited here; for it was the Custom of the Romans, to burn their dead,
to put their Ashes in an Urn, and then bury the same with certain Ceremonies,
in some field appointed for that purpose near unto their City; and commonly,
there was another Urn of fresh water, laid by the other, denoting the teares of
their friends.</P>
<P>Every of these Pots had in them (with the Ashes of the Dead) one piece of
Copper money, with the Inscription of the Emperor then reigning, some of
them were of <HI>Claudius,</HI> some of <HI>Vespasian,</HI> some of <HI>Nero,</HI> of <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> of
<HI>Trajanus,</HI> and others; Besides those Urns, many other Pots were found in the
same place, made of a white Earth, with long necks, and handles, like to our
stone Jugs: these were empty, but seemed to be buried full of some liquid mat∣ter,
long since consumed, and soked through; For there were found divers Vi∣als,
and other fashioned Glasses; some most cunningly wrought, and some of
Crystal, all which had water in them (which it seems were the teare-Bottles)
nothing differing in clearness, tast, or savour from common Spring water, what∣soever
it was at the first; Some of these Glasses had Oyl in them very thick, and
earthy in savour; some were supposed to have balm in them, but had lost the
vertue; many of these Pots and Glasses were broken in cutting of the Clay,
so that few were taken up whole.</P>
<P>There were also found divers Dishes and Cups, of a fine red coloured Earth,
which shewed outwardly such a shining smoothness, as if they had been of
Curtal; Those had (in the bottoms) <HI>Roman</HI> letters printed: There were also
<PB N="69" REF="44"/>
Lamps of white Earth and red, artificially wrought with divers Antiques about
them, some three or four Images, made of white Earth, about a span long each
of them; one was of <HI>Pallas.</HI> Amongst divers of those Antiquities, there
was sound one Urn, with Ashes and Bones, and one pot of white Earth, very
small, not exceeding the quantity of a quartern of a Wine pint, made in shape
of a Hare squatted upon her leggs, and between her Eares is the mouth of the
Pot.</P>
<P>There hath also bin found (in the same field) divers Coffins of stone, con∣taining
the bones of men; these I suppose to be the Burials of some special per∣sons,
in time of the <HI>Britons,</HI> or <HI>Saxons,</HI> after that the <HI>Romans</HI> had left to govern
here.</P>
<P>Morever, there were also found the sculls and bones of men, without
Coffins; or rather, whose Coffins (being of Timber) were consumed; divers
great Nails of Iron were there sound, such as are used in the Wheels of shod
Carts; being each of them as big as a mans finger, and a quarter of a yard long;
the heads two inches over: Those nayles were more wondred at, then the rest
of the things there found; and many Opinions of men were there passed upon
them; namely, that the men there buried, were murthered by driving those
nayles into their heads.</P>
<P>But to set down what was observed, concerning this matter; there were
there, the bones of a man lying, the head North, the feet South, and round a∣bout
him (athwart his head) along both his sides, and thwart his feet such nails
were found; wherefore it may be conjectured, they were the nayls of his
Coffin, which had bin a trough cut out of some great Tree; and the same co∣vered
with a Plank of that thickness, fastened with such nayls, and found under
the broad heads of some of those nayls, the old Wood was found scant turned
into Earth; but still retaining both the grain and proper colour. And thus
much for that part of <HI>Bishopsgate</HI>-Ward; now we will proceed to that part
which lyeth within the <HI>Gate.</HI></P>
<P>And first, to begin on the left hand of <HI>Bishopsgate;</HI> from the <HI>Gate</HI> ye have
certain Tenements of old time, pertaining to a Brother-hood of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI>
granted to the Parish Clarks of <HI>London,</HI> for two Chaplains to be kept in the
Chappel of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> near unto the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> in the
27. of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. The first of these Houses towards the North, and against
the Wall of the City, was sometime a large Inne or Court, called the <HI>Wrastlers</HI>
of such a signe; And the last in the high street, towards the South, was some∣time
also a fair Inne, called the Angel, of such a signe. Amongst these said
Tenements was (on the same street side) a fair Entry or Court, to the common
Hall of the said Parish-Clarks, with proper Alms-houses, seven in number ad∣joyning;
for Parish-Clarks, and their Wives, and their Widows, such as were
in great years, not able to labour; one of these by the said Brother-hood of
Parish-Clarks, was allowed sixteen pence the week: the other six had each of
them nine pence the week, according to the Patent granted to that
effect.</P>
<P>This Brother-hood (amongst other) being suppressed, in the Raign of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the sixth: the said Hall, with the other Buildings there, was given to Sir
<HI>Robert Chester,</HI> a Knight of <HI>Cambridge-shire,</HI> against whom the Parish-Clarks
commencing suit, in the Raign of Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> and being like to have pre∣vailed,
the said Sir <HI>Robert Chester</HI> pulled down the Hall, sold the Timber, stone,
and Lead; and thereupon the sui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was ended. The Alms-houses remained
in the Queens hands, and people were there placed, such as could make best
friends, some of them taking the pension appointed, and letting forth their
houses at great Rent, have given occasion to the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rson of the Parish, to chal∣lenge
Tithes of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="45"/>
Next unto this is the small Parish Church of <HI>Saint Ethelburgh, Virgin;</HI> and
from thence, some small distance is a large Court, called <HI>Little St. Helens,</HI> be∣cause
it pertained to the Nuns of St. <HI>Helens,</HI> and was their House: there were
there seven Alms-Rooms, or Houses for the poor, belonging to the Company
of <HI>Leathersellers;</HI> Then somewhat more West, is another Court, with a winding
Lane, which commeth out against the West end of St. <HI>Andrew Undershafts</HI>
Church. In this Court standeth the fair Church of St. <HI>Helen,</HI> sometime a <HI>Pri∣ory</HI>
of <HI>black Nuns;</HI> and in the same the Parish Church of St. <HI>Helen.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Priory</HI> was founded before the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third; <HI>William Ba∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</HI>
Dean of <HI>Pauls,</HI> was the first founder, and was there buried; and <HI>William
Basing,</HI> one of the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second,
was holden also to be a Founder, or rather an helper thereof: This <HI>Priory</HI> be∣ing
valued at 1314 l. 2 s. 6 d. was surrendred the five and twentieth of <HI>No∣vember,</HI>
the thirtieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth: the whole Church, the partition be∣twixt
the <HI>Nuns</HI> Church; and the Parish Church being taken down, remaineth
now to the Parish, and is a fair Church, but wanteth such a Steeple, as Sir
<HI>Thomas Gresham</HI> promised to have builded, in recompence of ground in that
Church, filled up with his Monument.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nuns</HI> Hall, and other Housing thereto pertaining, was since purchased
by the Company of <HI>Leather-sellers,</HI> and is their common Hall; which Com∣pany,
was incorporate, the one and twentieth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second.</P>
<P>A young new-born Child was taken up, between the great Ware-house, and
Sir <HI>Iohn Spencers</HI> back-gate, being (by a most unnatural Mother) there buried
in a great Dung-hill of Sea-coal Ashes, with the face upward; yet found alive
by <HI>Richard Atkinson,</HI> who used to make clean the passage there of the soyle,
carrying it thence with his Wheel-Barrow. The Child had not any ragg, or
Cloth about it, but was all bloodied, by reason that the Navil string was unty∣ed,
and the Body meerly crusted over with the Seacoal-dust; yet being made
clean by the poor mans Wife, it was found to be a most goodly Man-Child,
strong and well-featured, without any blemish or harm upon it; but strangled
inwardly, by sucking in the noysome filth and Ashes.</P>
<P>He was Christned, and named <HI>Iob cinere extractus, Iob</HI> taken out of the A∣shes,
He lived three dayes, and lies buried in the Church-yard, the fifth of
<HI>September,</HI> 1612.</P>

Ward: for it beginneth from the water Conduit, Westward on

on the Channel, which runneth into the water-course of <HI>Wall∣brook,</HI>
before ye come to the Postern called <HI>Moregate,</HI> and this
is the farthest West part of that Ward; Then have ye <HI>Broad street,</HI> where of the
Ward taketh name, which stretcheth out of the former street, from the East
Corner of <HI>Alhallowes</HI> Church-yard, somewhat South, to the Parish Church of
Saint <HI>Peter</HI> the poor on both sides, and then by the South Gate of the <HI>Augustine</HI>
Fryars, West, down <HI>Throgmorton</HI> street by the <HI>Drapers</HI> Hall, into <HI>Loathbury,</HI> to
another Grate of Iron on the Channel there, whence the water runneth into
the course of <HI>Wallbrook,</HI> under the East end of St. <HI>Margarets</HI> Church; certain
posts of Timber are there set up; and this is also the furthest▪ West part of this
Ward, in the said street, out of the which street it runneth up <HI>Bartholomew</HI>

up another part of <HI>Broad streete,</HI> South, to a Pump, over against St. <HI>Ben∣nets</HI>
Church.</P>
<P>Then have ye one other street, called <HI>Threed-needle</HI> street, beginning at the
Well with two Buckets, by St. <HI>Martins Oteswich</HI> Church Wall; This street
runneth down on both sides to <HI>Finkes-Lane,</HI> now called <HI>Finch Lane,</HI> and half
way up that Lane, to a Gate of a Marchants house on the West side, but not so
far on the East; Then the aforesaid street, from this <HI>Finkes</HI> Lane now <HI>Finch</HI>
Lane, runneth down by the Royal Exchange to the Stocks, and to a place
commonly called, the <HI>Scalding-house,</HI> or <HI>Scalding wicke,</HI> but now <HI>Scalding Al∣ley,</HI>
by the West side whereof, under the Parish Church of St. <HI>Mildred,</HI> runneth
the course of <HI>VVallbrooke,</HI> and these be the bounds of this Ward.</P>
<P>Here stands the Parish Church of <HI>Alhallowes</HI> in the Wall, so called of standing
close to the Wall of the City near <HI>Moorfields,</HI> and over against <HI>Winchester house,</HI>
which was so vast and spacious a Mansion, that it has been many years since cut,
into divers habitations; For the Glasse-house stood in part of it, the Spanish
Ambassadour had another part; And now of late, the Excise Office hath bin kept
in another part.</P>
<P>On the other side of the street, among many proper Houses (possessed
for the most part by <HI>Curriers)</HI> is the <HI>Carpenters Hall,</HI> which Company
was Incorporated in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth.</P>
<P>Then East from the <HI>Curriers</HI> row, is a long and high Wall of stone in the
foresaid <HI>Winchester house,</HI> enclosing the North side of a large Garden, adioy∣ning
to as large an house, builded in the Reigns of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and
of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, by Sir <HI>William Powlet,</HI> Lord Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> thorow
his Garden, which (of old time) consisted of divers parts, now united, was
sometimes a fair foot way, leading by the West end of the <HI>Augustine</HI> Fryars

against <HI>London</HI> Wall, towards <HI>Mooregate,</HI> which foot-way had Gates at either

the Gates are closed up with Stone, whereby the people are enforced to

and all the said great place and Garden of Sir <HI>William Pawlet,</HI> to <HI>London</HI> Wall,

The Fryars Church he pulled not down, but the West end thereof, enclosed
from the Steeple and Quire, was in the year 1550, granted to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Na∣tion
in <HI>London,</HI> to be their preaching place; The other part, namely, the Stee∣ple,

part of <HI>Gresham</HI> House, which is in <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> street, there are placed eight
Alms-houses, builded of Brick and Timber, by Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham</HI> Knight, for
eight Almes-men, which be now there placed rent-free, and receive each
of them by his gift, six pound thirteen shillings four pence yearly for
ever.</P>
<P>Next unto <HI>Pawlet</HI> House, is the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> the poor, so
called for a difference from other of that name, sometime (peradventure) a
poor Parish, but at this present there be many fair Houses, possessed by rich
Marchants, and others. In this little Church there be some fair Monuments,
one of Sir <HI>Thomas Lowe,</HI> and another of Sir <HI>VVilliam Garaway,</HI> with <HI>Iohn Lucas</HI>
Esquire of <HI>Colchester.</HI></P>
<P>Then next have ye the <HI>Augustine</HI> Fryers Church, and Church-yard, the en∣tring
thereunto by a South gate to the West Porch, a large Church having a
most fine spired Steeple, small, high, and streight, that there are few the like,
founded by <HI>Humphrey Bohun,</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> in the year one thou∣sand
two hundred fifty three. <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egnald Cobham</HI> gave this Messuage in <HI>London,</HI>
to the enlarging thereof, in the year one thousand three hundred fourty four.
<HI>Humphrey Bohun</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> re-edified this Church in the year
1354, whose Body was there buried in the Quire.</P>
<P>The small spired Steeple of this Church was overthrown by tempest of wind,
in the year one thousand three hundred sixty two, but was raised of new, as still
it might have stood, had not private benefit (the only devourer of Antiquity)
pull'd it down.</P>
<P>Both that goodly Steeple, and all that East part of the Church, hath lately
been taken down, and Houses (for one mans commodity) raised in the place,
whereby <HI>London</HI> hath lost so goodly an ornament, and times hereafter may more
talk of it.</P>
<P>This House was valued at fifty seven pounds, and was surrendred the twelfth
of <HI>November,</HI> the 13 of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8. There were many great Monuments in
this Fryers Church, one of <HI>Edmond</HI> first son to <HI>Ioan</HI> mother to <HI>Richard</HI> the se∣cond,
<HI>Guy de Meryke</HI> Earl of Saint <HI>Paul, Lucie</HI> Countesse of <HI>Kent, Richard</HI> the
great Earl of <HI>Arundel, Surrey,</HI> &amp; <HI>VVarren,</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Atcourt</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembrooke,
<PB N="73" REF="46"/>
Iohn Vere</HI> Earle of <HI>Oxford,</HI> with <HI>Aubery de Vere</HI> his son, the Lady of <HI>Bed∣ford,</HI>
with <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and very many more persons of
quality.</P>
<P>On the South side, and at West end of this Church, many fair houses
are builded; namely in <HI>Throgmorton</HI> street, one very large and spacious, builded
in the place of old and small Tenements, by <HI>Thomas Cromwel,</HI> Master of the
Kings Jewel-house, after that, Master of the <HI>Rolls,</HI> then Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> Knight,
Lord Privie Seal, Vicar General, Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> high Chamberlain of <HI>England,
&amp;c.</HI> This house being finished, and having some reasonable plot of ground
left for a Garden, he caused the pales of the Gardens adjoyning to
the North part thereof, on a sudden to be taken down, two and twe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ty
foot to be measured forth-right into the North of every mans ground,
a Line there to be drawn, a Trench to be cast, a foundation laid and an high Brick
Wall to be builded; and this was suddenly and no warning given, nor
other answer, but (when any spake to the Surveyers of that work) they said
their Master Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> commanded them so to do; so that no man durst go to
argue the matter, but each man lost his Land; Thus the sudden rising of some
men, causeth them to forget themselves.</P>
<P>The Company of <HI>Drapers</HI> in <HI>London</HI> bought this House, and now the same is
their Common Hall. This Company obtained of King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, in the
seventeenth of his Reign, to be incorporate. <HI>Iohn Gedney</HI> was chosen to be
their first Master, and the four Wardens were, <HI>Iohn VVotton, I. Darby, Robert
Breton,</HI> and <HI>T. Cooke;</HI> The Armes granted to the said Company by Sir <HI>VVilliam
Bridges</HI> Knight, first Garter King at Arms, in <HI>Blazon</HI> are thus. Three Sun Beams,
issuing out of three Clouds of flame, crowned with three Crowns, Imperials of
Gold, upon a Shield Azure.</P>
<P>From this Hall, on the same side, down to the Grates and course of <HI>VVall∣brooke,</HI>
have ye divers fair houses for Marchants and other, from the which
Grates back again on the other side in <HI>Lotisbury</HI> (so called in Record of <HI>Edward</HI>
the third, the thirty eighth year, and now corruptly called <HI>Lothbury)</HI> are <HI>Can∣dlestick</HI>
founders placed, till ye come to <HI>Bartholmew</HI> Lane, so called of Saint
<HI>Bartholmew's</HI> Church, at the South-east corner thereof. In this Lane also are di∣vers
fair builded Houses on both sides, and so likewise have ye in the other street,
which stretcheth from the Fryers <HI>Augustines</HI> South gate, to the corner over
against Saint <HI>Bennets</HI> Church. In this street, amongst other fair buildings the
most ancient was (of old time) an house pertaining to the Abbot of Saint <HI>Al∣bans;
Iohn Catcher</HI> Alderman (after) dwelled there; Then is the free School,
pertaining to the late dissolved Hospital of Saint <HI>Anthony,</HI> whereof more shall
be shewed in another place, and so up to <HI>Thred-needle-street.</HI></P>
<P>On the South part of which street, beginning at the East, by the Well with
two Buckets, now turned to a Pump, is the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Martin</HI> cal∣led
<HI>Oteswitch,</HI> of <HI>Martin de Oteswitch, Nicholas de Oteswich, William Oteswich,</HI>
and <HI>Iohn Oteswich</HI> Founders thereof, and all buried there, as appeareth by their
Monuments.</P>
<P>There is also there a fair engraven Stone, with a Latine Epitaph upon the
Lord <HI>Iames Fulkes</HI> Treasurer of <HI>Holland</HI> and Ambassador for the States of the
united Provinces here in <HI>England.</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Row</HI> gave 5 <HI>l.</HI> to perpetuity to
this Parish, to buy Bread and Coals for the poor.</P>
<P>Some small distance from thence is the <HI>Merchant-Taylors Hall,</HI> pertaining
to the Guild and Fraternity of Saint <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> time out of mind called of
Taylors and Linnen Armorers of <HI>London;</HI> For we find that King <HI>Edward</HI> the
first, in the eight and twentieth of his Reign, confirmed this Guild by the name
of <HI>Taylors</HI> and <HI>Linnen Armorers,</HI> and also gave to the Brethren thereof, autho∣rity
every year at Mid-summer to hold a feast and to choose unto them a Go∣vernour
<PB N="74" REF="47"/>
or Master, with Wardens; whereupon, the same year, one thou∣sand
three hundred, on the Feast day of the Nativity of Saint <HI>John Baptist,</HI> they
chose <HI>Henry de Ryall</HI> to be their <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lgrim;</HI> For the Master of this Mystery (as one
that travelled for the whole Company) was then so called, untill the eleventh
year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and the four Wardens were then called <HI>Purveyers
of Alms,</HI> (now called Quartredge) of the said Fraternity.</P>
<P>This Merchant-Taylors Hall, sometime perteining to a worthy Gentleman,
named <HI>Edmund Crepin, Dominus Creep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng</HI> after some Record; he, in the year
of Christ 1331, the sixth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, for a certain sum of money to
him paid, made this grant thereof, by the name of his principal Messuage, in
the Wards of <HI>Cornhill</HI> and <HI>Broad-street,</HI> which Sir <HI>Oliver Ingham</HI> Knight, did
then hold, to <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Yakeley</HI> the Kings Pavilion-maker; This was called the
<HI>New Hall,</HI> or <HI>Taylors Inne,</HI> for a difference from their old Hall, which was a∣bout
the back side of the <HI>Red Lion</HI> in <HI>Basing Lane,</HI> and in the Ward of <HI>Cord∣wayner</HI>
street.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Thomas Holm,</HI> aliàs <HI>Clarentiaux</HI>
King of Armes for the South part of <HI>England,</HI> granted by his Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents to the
said Fraternity and Guild of Saint <HI>John Baptist</HI> of <HI>Taylors</HI> and <HI>Linnen Armorers,</HI>
to beat in a field Silver, a Pavilion between two Mantles Imperial, Purple,
garnished with Gold, in a chief Azure, a holy Lamb, set within a Sun, the Crest
upon the Helm; a Pavilion purp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, garnished with Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>After this King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, was himself a Brother of this Fraternity,
or Guild of S. <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> of <HI>Taylors</HI> or <HI>Linnen Armorers,</HI> (as divers others of
his Predecessors Kings had been) to wit <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ohard</HI> the third, <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth,
<HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Richard</HI> the second. And
for that divers of that Fraternity had (time out of mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e) been great Merchants,
and had frequented all sorts of Merchandizes into most parts of the world, to
the honour of the Kings Realm, and to the great profit of his Subjects,
and of his Progenitors, and the men of the said Mystery, (during the time
aforesaid) had exercised the buying and selling of all Wares and Merchandi∣zes,
especially, of Woollen Cloth, as well in grosse, as by retaile, through∣out
all this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and chiefly within the said City; therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
of his especial grace, did change, transfer, and translate, the Guild aforesaid,
and did incorporate them into the name of the Master and Wardens of
the <HI>Merchant-Taylors,</HI> of the Fraternity of S. <HI>John Baptist</HI> in the City of
<HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Some distance West from this <HI>Merchant-Taylors</HI> Hall, is <HI>Finkes</HI> Lane, so
called of <HI>Robert Finke,</HI> and <HI>Robert Finke</HI> his son, <HI>James Finke</HI> and <HI>Rosamond
Finke; Robert Finke</HI> the elder new builded the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Bennet</HI>
commonly called <HI>Finke</HI> of the Founder; his Tenements were both of St. <HI>Ben∣uets</HI>
parish, and Saint <HI>Martins Oteswich</HI> Parish, the one half of this <HI>Finke</HI>
Lane is of <HI>Broad</HI>-street ward, to wit, on the West side, up to the great and
principal house, wherein the said <HI>Finke</HI> dwelled; But on the other side,
namely the East, not so much towards <HI>Cornhil.</HI></P>
<P>Then without this Lane, in the aforesaid <HI>Threed-Needle</HI> street, is the
said Parish Church of Saint <HI>Bennet</HI> a handsome Church in which are sun∣dry
old Monuments.</P>
<P>There happened lately a great fire in <HI>Threed-Needle</HI> street, over against
<HI>Merchant-Taylors</HI> Hall, which rag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as far as Saint <HI>Bennets</HI> Church Walls,
and there the fury was s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opped, otherwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it might have destroyed all

On the North side of this street, from over against the East corner, of St.
<HI>Martins Osteswich</HI> Church, have ye divers fair and large houses, till you come
to the Hospital of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> sometime a Cell of St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> of <HI>Vienna;</HI>
For we read, that King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, granted to the Brother-hood of St. <HI>An∣thony</HI>
of <HI>Vienna,</HI> a place amongst the Jewes, which was sometime their <HI>Synagogue,</HI>
and had been builded by them, about the year 1231. But the Christians ob∣tained
of the King, that it should be dedicated to our <HI>blessed Lady;</HI> and since,
an Hospital being there builded, was called St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> It was
founded in the Parish of St. <HI>Bennet Finke,</HI> for a Master, two Priests, one School-master,
and twelve poor men; after which foundation, amongst other things,
was given to this Hospital, one Messuage and Garden, whereon was builded the
fair large <HI>Free-School,</HI> and one other parcel of ground, containing thirty seven
foot in length, and eighteen foot in breadth, whereon were builded the <HI>Alms-Houses</HI>
of hard Stone and Timber, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. Which said
<HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, in the twentieth of his Reign, gave unto <HI>Iohn Carpenter,</HI> Dr. of
Divinity, and Master of St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> Hospital, and to his Brethren, and their
Successors for ever, his Mannor of <HI>Poinington,</HI> with the appurtenances, with
certain Pensions, and Portions of <HI>Milburn, Burneworth, Charleton,</HI> and <HI>Up-Wimburn,</HI>
in the County of <HI>Southhamton,</HI> towards the maintenance of five
Scholars in the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> to be brought up in the faculty of Arts, af∣ter
the rate of ten pence the week for every Scholar; so that the said Scholars
be first instructed in the rudiments of Grammar, at the Colledge of <HI>Eaton,</HI> foun∣ded
by the said King.</P>
<P>In the year 1474. <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>4th</HI> granted to <HI>William Say,</HI> Batchelor of Di∣vinity,
Master of the said Hospital, to have Priests, Clerks, Scholars, poor men,
and Brethren of the same, Clerks, or Laymen, Queristers, Procters, Messengers,
Servants in Houshold, and other things whatsoever, like as the Prior, and Co∣vent
of St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> of <HI>Vienna, &amp;c.</HI> He also annexed, united, and appropriated
the said Hospital, unto the Collegiate of St. <HI>George</HI> in <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>The Protectors of this House, were to collect the benevolence of charitable
Persons, towards the building and supporting thereof.</P>
<P>In the year 1499. Sir <HI>John Tate,</HI> sometime Alebrewer, then a Mercer,
caused his Brewhouse, called the Swan, near adjoyning to the said Free Chap∣pel,
College, or Hospital of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> to be taken for the enlarging of the
Church, which was then newly builded; toward the building whereof, the
said <HI>Tate</HI> gave great sums of money, and finished it in the year 1501, Sir <HI>John
Tate,</HI> deceased 1514. and was there buried, under a fair Monument by him
prepared, Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> Master of the Rolls, and other.</P>
<P><HI>Walter Champion,</HI> Draper, one of the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> 1529. was buried
there, and gave to the Beadmen twenty pounds, The Lands by year of this
Hospital, were valued in the 37. of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to be 55l. 6 s.
and 8. pence.</P>
<P>One <HI>Iohnson</HI> (a Schoolmaster of the famous Free-School there) became a
prebend of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and then (by little and little) followed the spoil of this
Hospital: he first dissolved the Quire, conveyed away the Plate and Ornaments,
then the Bels; and lastly, put out the Alms men from their houses, appoin∣ting
them portions of twelve pence the week to each; but now I hear of no
such matter performed; for their houses, with other, be letten out for rent, and
the Church is a preaching place for the French Nation, as was touched
before.</P>
<P>This School was commended in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and sithence
commended above other; but now decayed, and come to nothing, by taking
that from it, which thereunto belonged.</P>
<P>Next is the Parish Church of St. <HI>Bartholmew,</HI> at the end of <HI>Bartholmew</HI> Lane,
<HI>Thomas Pike</HI> Alderman, with the assistance of <HI>Nicholas Yoo,</HI> one of the Shetiffs
<PB N="76" REF="48"/>
of <HI>London,</HI> about the year 1438. new builded this Church.</P>
<P>West from this Church, have ye <HI>Scalding Alley,</HI> of old time called <HI>Scalding
House,</HI> or <HI>Scalding wick,</HI> because that ground (for the most part) was then im∣ployed
by Poulterers, that dwelled in the high street, from the Stocks Market,
to the great Conduit. Their Poultry which they sold at their stalls, were scal∣ded
there: the street doth yet bear the name of the Poultry, and the Poulte∣rers
are but lately departed from thence, into other streets, as into <HI>Grasse-street,</HI>
and the ends of <HI>St. Nicholas Flesh-shambles.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Scalding wick,</HI> is the farthest part of <HI>Broadstreet-Ward,</HI> and is (by the
water called <HI>Wallbrook)</HI> parted from <HI>Cheap-Ward.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Seventh Ward, or Aldermanry of
the City of London, called Corn-hill
Ward.</HEAD>
<P>NOw <HI>Cornhil</HI> Ward comes to consideration, corruptly called <HI>Cornwel</HI>
by the vulgar; It was called <HI>Corn-hill</HI> of a Corn-Market, time out of
mind there holden, and is a part of the principal high street, begin∣ning
at the West end of <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> stretching down West, on both
the sides, by the South end of <HI>Finkes Lane,</HI> on the right hand, and by the North
end of <HI>Birchoven</HI> Lane, on the left part: of which Lanes, to wit, to the middle
of them, is of this Ward, and so down to the Stocks Market; and this is the
bounds. The upper or East part of this Ward, and also a part of <HI>Limestreet</HI>
Ward, hath been (as I said) a Market-place, especially for Corn, and since for all
kind of Victuals, as is partly shewed in <HI>Limestreet</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>It appeareth by Record, that in the year 1522. the <HI>Rippiers</HI> of Rie and other
places, sold their fresh Fish in <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> Market upon <HI>Cornhill;</HI> but forraign
Butchers were not admitted there to sell Flesh, till the year 1533.</P>
<P>And it was enacted, that Butchers should sell their Bief, not above a half
peny the pound; and Mutton, half peny, half farthing: which Act being de∣vised,
for the great Commodity of the Realm, (as it was then thought) hath
since proved far otherwise; for, before that time, a fat <HI>Oxe</HI> was sold at <HI>London,</HI>
for six and twenty shillings eight pence, at the most; a far <HI>Weather,</HI> for three
shillings four pence; a fat Calf at the same price; a fat Lamb for twelve pence;
pieces of Bief weighing, 2. pounds and a half at the least, yea, 3. pound or better
for a peny, on every Butchers Stall in this City; and of those pieces of Bief, 13, or
fourteen for twelve pence; fat Mutton for eight pence the quarter; and one
hundred weight of Bief, for four shillings eight pence, at the dearest.</P>
<P>What the price is now, I need not set down; many men thought the same
Act to raise the price, <HI>by reason that Grasier knew, or supposed what weight every
their Beasts contained:</HI> and so raising their price thereafter, the Butcher could
be no gainer, but by likewise raising his price: the number of Butchers then
in the City and Suburbs, was accounted sixscore, of which every one killed six
Oxen a peece weekly, which is in forty six weeks, 33120. Oxen, or seven hun∣dred
and twenty Oxen weekly.</P>
<P>The forraign Butchers (for a long time) stood in the high street of <HI>Limestreet</HI>-Ward,
on the North side, twice every week, <HI>viz,</HI> Wednesdayes and Saturdayes,
and wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some gain to the Tenants, before whose doors they stood, and into
<PB N="77" REF="48"/>
who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e houses they set their blocks and stalls; but that advantage being e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pied,
they were taken into <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> there to pay for their standing to the Cham∣ber
of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much for the Market upon <HI>Cornhill.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Ornaments in <HI>Cornhill-VVard,</HI> are these;</P>
<P>First, at the East end thereof, in the middle of the high street, and at the
parting of four wayes, have ye a Water-Standard, placed in the year 1582. in
manner following; A certain <HI>German,</HI> named <HI>Peter Morris,</HI> having made an ar∣tificial
<HI>Forcier</HI> for that purpose, conveyed <HI>Thames-water</HI> in Pipes of Lead, over
the Steeple of St. <HI>Magnus</HI> Church, at the North end of <HI>London-Bridge;</HI> and
from thence into divers mens Houses in <HI>Thames-street,</HI> New <HI>Fish-street,</HI> and
<HI>Grasse-street,</HI> (now <HI>Gracious-street)</HI> up to the North West corner of <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI>
the highest ground of all the City; where the waste of the main Pipe rising into
this Standard (provided at the charges of the City) with four spouts, did at
every Tyde run (according to Covenant) four wayes, plentifully serving to the
Commodity of the Inhabitants, near adjoyning in their houses; and also clean∣sed
the Channels of the street, toward <HI>Bishops-gate, Aldgate,</HI> the <HI>Bridge,</HI> and the
<HI>Stocks Market;</HI> but now no such matter, by what default I know not.</P>
<P>Then have ye a fair Conduit, of sweet water, castellated in the midst of
that Ward; This Conduit was first builded of stone, in the year 1282. by <HI>Henry
VVallis,</HI> Maior of <HI>London,</HI> to be a Prison for Night-walkers, and other suspicious
persons, and was called the <HI>Tunne upon Cornhill;</HI> because the same was builded
somewhat in fashion of a Tunne, standing on the one end.</P>
<P>To this Prison, the Night-watchers to this City, committed not only Night-walkers,
but also other persons, as well spiritual as temporal, whom they sus∣pected
of incontinency, and punished them according to the customs of this
City; but complaint therefore being made, about the year of Christ, 1297.
King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, writeth to the Citizens thus.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Edward</HI> by the Grace of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> VVhereas <HI>Richard Gravesend▪</HI> Bishop of
<HI>London,</HI> hath shewed unto us, that by the great Charter of <HI>England,</HI> the Church
hath a privilede, that no Clark should be imprisoned by a Lay-man, without
our Commandment, and breach of peace: Which notwithstanding, some Ci∣tizens
of <HI>London,</HI> upon meer spight, do enter in their vvatches, into Clarks
Chambers, and then (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike Felons) carry them to the <HI>Tunne,</HI> which <HI>Henry le
Wallis,</HI> sometime Maior, built for Night-walkers; wherefore we will, that
this our Commandment, be proclaimed in a full <HI>Hustings,</HI> and that no vvatch
hereafter enter into any Clarks Chamber, under the forfeit of thirty pounds.</Q>
Dated at <HI>Carlile,</HI> the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> the 25. of our Reign.</P>
<P>More we read, that about the year of Christ 1299. the seven and twentieth
of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, certain principal Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> to wit, <HI>T. Romane,
Rich: Gloucester, Nicholas Faringdon, Adam Helingbury, T. Saly, Iohn Dun∣stable,
Richard Ashwy, John Wade,</HI> and <HI>William Stortforde,</HI> brake up this Prison,
called the <HI>Tunne,</HI> and took out certain Prisoners; for the which they were
sharply punished, by long Imprisonment, and great fines; It cost the Citizens
(as some have written) more than 20000 Marks, which they were amerced in,
before <HI>William de March,</HI> Treasurer of the Kings Exchequer, to purchase the
Kings favour, and the confirmation of their Liberties.</P>
<P>By the West side of the aforesaid Prison, then called the <HI>Tunne,</HI> was a fair
Well of Spring water, curbed round with hard stone, but in the year 1401. the
said Prison house called the <HI>Tunne,</HI> was made a Cestern for sweet water, con∣veyed
by Pipes of Lead, from <HI>Tyburne,</HI> and was from thenceforth called the
<HI>Conduit upon Cornhil;</HI> Then was the Well planked over, and a strong Prison
made of Timber, called a Cage, with a pair of Stocks therein, set upon it; and
this was for Night-walkers: on the top of which Cage, was placed a Pillory,
for the punishment of Bakers, offending in the assize of Bread, for Millers
<PB N="78" REF="49"/>
stealing of Corn at the Mill; for Bawds, Scholds, and other offen∣ders.</P>
<P>As in the year 1468. the seventh of <HI>Edward,</HI> the fourth, divers persons, be∣ing
common Jurors, such as at Assizes, were forsworn for rewards, or favour
of parties, were judged to ride from <HI>Newgate,</HI> to the Pillory in <HI>Corn-hill,</HI> with
Miters of Paper on their heads, there to stand, and from thence again to <HI>New∣gate,</HI>
and this judgement was given by the Maior of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>On the North side of this street, from the East unto the West, have ye divers
fair houses, for Marchants and others; amongst the which, one large House is
called the <HI>Wey-house,</HI> where Marchandizes brought from beyond the Seas, are
to be weighed at the Kings Beame: this House hath a Master, and under him
four Master-Porters, with Porters under them, they have a strong Cart, and
four great Horses, to draw and carry the Wates from the Marchants Houses to
the Beam, and back again; Sir <HI>Thomas Lovel,</HI> Knight, builded this House, with
a fair front of Tenements, toward t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e street, all which he gave to the <HI>Grocers</HI> of
<HI>London,</HI> himself being free of the City, and a Brother of that Com∣pany.</P>
<P>Then have ye the said <HI>Finks</HI> Lane, the South end of which Lane, on both sides,
is in <HI>Corn-hill</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>Then next is the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> erected in the year 1566. after this Order,
<HI>viz.</HI> certain Houses upon <HI>Corn-hill,</HI> and the like upon the part thereof, in the
Ward of <HI>Broadstreet,</HI> with three Allies; the first called <HI>Swan Alley,</HI> opening
into <HI>Corn-hill;</HI> the second, <HI>New Alley,</HI> passing through out of <HI>Corn-hill,</HI> into
<HI>Broadstreet</HI> Ward, over against St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>-Lane; the third, St. <HI>Christo∣phers</HI>
Alley, opening into <HI>Broadstreet</HI>-Ward, and into St. <HI>Christophers</HI> Parish,
containing many thick Housholds, were first purchased by the Citizens of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
for more than 3532. pounds, and were sold for 478. pounds, to such per∣sons
as should take them down, and carry them thence; Also the ground, or
plot was made plain, at the Charges of the City, and then possession thereof
was by certain Aldermen (in name of the whole Citizens) given to Sir <HI>Tho∣mas
Gresham</HI> Knight, sometimes Agent to the Queens Higheness, thereupon to
build a <HI>Burse,</HI> or place for Marchants to assemble in, at his own proper charges;
And he, on the seventh of <HI>June,</HI> laying the first stone of the Foundation, being
Brick, accompanied with some Aldermen, every of them laid a piece of Gold,
which the Workmen took up; and forthwith followed upon the same, such di∣ligence,
that by the Moneth of <HI>November,</HI> in the year 1567. the same was co∣vered
with slate, and shortly after fully finished.</P>
<P>In the year 1570. on the 23. of January, the Queens Majesty, attended with
her Nobility, came from her House at the Strand, called <HI>Sommerset-House,</HI> and
entred the City by Temple-Barre, through Fleet-street, Cheape, and so by the
North side of the Burse, through Thredneedle-street, to Sir, <HI>Thomas Greshams</HI>
House in Bishopgate-street, where she dined: After dinner, her Majesty returning
through Corn-hill, entred the Burse on the South side; and after she had viewed
every part thereof above the ground, especially the <HI>Pawne,</HI> which was richly fur∣nished
with all sorts of the finest Wares in the City, she caused the same <HI>Burse,</HI> by
an Haura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and a Trumpet, to be proclaimed at the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> and so to
to be called from thenceforth, and not otherwise.</P>
<P>Next adjoyning to this <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> remaineth one part of a large
stone House, and is now called the Castle, of such a sign at a Tavern door; there
is a passage thorough out of <HI>Cornhill,</HI> into <HI>Threed-needle</HI> street; the other part
of the said stone House was taken down, for enlarging the <HI>Royal Exchange;</HI> This
stone House was said of some to have been a Church, whereof it had no propor∣tion;
of others, a <HI>Jewes</HI> House, as though none but Jewes had dwelt in stone
houses, but that opinion is without warrant.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="49"/>
For beside the strong building of stone houses, against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of thieves
in the night when no watches were kept, In the first year of <HI>Rich∣ard</HI>
the first, (to prevent casualties of fire, which often had hapned in
the City, when the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uses were builded of Timber, and covered with
Reed and Straw, <HI>Henry Fitz Allwine</HI> being Mayor) it was Decreed, That from
thenceforth, no man should build within the City but of some unto a certain
height, and to cover the same building with Slate, or burnt Tyle; This was the
very cause of such stone Buildings, whereof many have rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined until out time
that for gaining of ground, they have been taken down, and in place of some
of them being low, (as but two Stories above the ground) many Houses of four
or five Stories high are placed.</P>
<P>From this Stone House down to the <HI>Stocks,</HI> are divers large Houses, especial∣ly
for height, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Merchants and Artificers.</P>
<P>On the South side of this High-street, is the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Peter</HI>
upon <HI>Cornhill,</HI> which seemeth to be of an ancient building, but not so an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient
as fame reporteth; for it hath been lately repaired, if not all new builded, ex∣cept
the Steeple which is ancient.</P>
<P>The Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this Church and Glazing, was finished in the Reign of King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the fourth, as appeareth by Armes of Noble men, and Aldermen of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
then living. There remaineth in this Church a Table, wherein it is written
I know not by what Authority, but of no late hand, that King <HI>Lucius</HI> founded
the same Church, to be an <HI>Archbishops See,</HI> Metropolitan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and chief Church of
his Kingdom, and that it so continued the space of four hundred years, unto the
coming of <HI>Augustine</HI> the Monk.</P>
<P>Now, because many may be curious to be further acquainted therewith,
I have here inserted the same <HI>Verbatim,</HI> as it is there recorded in the Table.</P>
<P>BE it known unto all men, that the year of our Lord God 179, <HI>Lucius</HI> the
first Christian King of this Land, then called <HI>Britaine,</HI> sounded the first
Church in <HI>London,</HI> that is to say, the Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> upon <HI>Cornhill;</HI> and
he founded there an <HI>Archbishops See,</HI> and made that Church the Metropolitan
and chief Church of this Kingdom, and so endured the space of four hundred
years, unto the coming of St. <HI>Austin, the Apostle of the English,</HI> the which was
sent into this Land by St. <HI>Gregory</HI> the Doctor of the Church, in the time of King
<HI>Ethilbert;</HI> And then was the Archbishops <HI>See,</HI> and <HI>Pall,</HI> removed from the
foresaid Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> upon <HI>Cornhill,</HI> unto <HI>Doreburniam</HI> that now is called
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> and there remaineth to this day. And <HI>Millet</HI> the Monk, which
came into the Land with S. <HI>Austin,</HI> was made this first Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and his
<HI>See</HI> was made in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, And this King <HI>Lucius</HI> was the first Founder
of St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church upon <HI>Cornhill;</HI> and he reigned in this Land after <HI>Brute,</HI> a
thousand two hundred fourty five years, and the year of our Lord God, a hun∣dred
twenty four, <HI>Lucius</HI> was Crowned King: and the years of his Reign were
seventy seven years, and he was (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter some Chronicle) buried at <HI>London;</HI> and
(after some Chronicle) he was buried at <HI>Glocester,</HI> in that place where the Or∣der
of St. <HI>Francis</HI> standeth now.</P>
<P><HI>Joceline</HI> of <HI>Furn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is</HI> writeth, that <HI>Thean</HI> or <HI>Theon,</HI> the first Arch bishop of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
in the Reign of <HI>Lucius</HI> builded the said Church, by the aid of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ran</HI>
chief Butler to King <HI>Lucius:</HI> and also that Etv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nus the second Archbishop buil∣ded
a Library to the same adjoyning, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erted many of the <HI>Druydes</HI> lear∣ned
men in the Pagan Law, to Christianity.</P>
<P><HI>William Harrison,</HI> discoursing hereon more at large, hath these very
words,</P>
<P>There is a Controversy (saith he) moved among our Historiographers, whe∣ther
the Church that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> built at <HI>London,</HI> stood at <HI>Westminster,</HI> or in <HI>Cornhill,</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="50"/>
For, there is some cause, why the Metropolitane Church should be thought to
stand where St. <HI>Peters</HI> now doth, by the space of four hundred and od years, be∣fore
it was removed to <HI>Canterbury</HI> by <HI>Austin</HI> the Monk, if a man would lean to
one side without any conference of the asseverations of the other; But herein
there may lurk some scruple; for, besides that St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church stood in the
East end of the City, and that of <HI>Apollo</HI> in the West; the word <HI>Cornhil,</HI> a deno∣mination
given of late (so speak of) to one street, may easily be mistaken for
<HI>Thorney.</HI></P>
<P>For as the word <HI>Thorney,</HI> proceedeth from the <HI>Saxons;</HI> who called the West
end of the City by that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame where <HI>Westminster</HI> now standeth, because of
the wildernesse and bushine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of the soile, so we do not read of any street in
<HI>London,</HI> called <HI>Cornhill,</HI> before the Conquest of the <HI>Normans:</HI> wherefore, I
hold with them, which make <HI>Westminster</HI> to be the place, where <HI>Lucius</HI> builded
his Church, upon the ruines of that Fane, 264 years (as <HI>Malmsbury</HI> saith) be∣fore
the coming of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and four hundred and eleven before the arrival
of <HI>Augustine.</HI></P>
<P>Read also his Appendix in Lib. fourth <HI>Pontif.</HI> where he noteth the time of
the <HI>Saxons,</HI> in the 444 of Grace, and of <HI>Augustine</HI> in 596 of Christ, which is a
manifest account, though some Copies have 499 for the one, but not without-manifest
corruption and error.</P>
<P>And now to return where we left; True it is, that a Library there was, per∣taining
to this Parish Church, of old time builded of Stone, and of late repaired
with Brick, by the Executors of Sir <HI>Iohn Crosby</HI> Alderman, as his Arms on the
South end do witnesse.</P>
<P>This Library hath been (of late time) to wit within this seventy years, well
furnished of Books, <HI>Iohn Leyland</HI> viewed and commended them: but now those
Books are gone, and this place is occupied by a School-master, and his Usher,
for a number of Scholers learning their Grammer Rules, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Notwithstanding
before that time, a Grammar School had been kept in this Parish, as appeareth
in the year a thousand four hundred twenty five.</P>
<P>We read, that <HI>John Whitby</HI> was Rector, and <HI>John Steward</HI> School-master
there; and in the five and twentieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, it was Enacted by Par∣liament,
that four Grammer Schools in <HI>London,</HI> should be maintained, <HI>viz</HI>
In the Parishes of <HI>Alhallowes</HI> in <HI>Thames</HI> street, Saint <HI>Andrew</HI> in <HI>Oldburn,</HI> Saint
<HI>Peters</HI> upon <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Acres.</HI></P>
<P>Then have ye the Parish Church of St. <HI>Michael</HI> the Archangel: for the antiquity
thereof, we find that <HI>Alnothus</HI> the Priest, gave it to the Abbot and Covent of
<HI>Covesham; Raynold</HI> the Abbot and the Covent there, did grant the same to
<HI>Sparling</HI> the Priest, in all measures, as he and his Predecessors before had held
it: to the which <HI>Sparling</HI> also, they granted all their Lands which they there
had, except certain Lands which <HI>Orgar le proud</HI> held of them, and paid two
shillings yearly; For the which grant, the said <HI>Sparling</HI> should yearly pay one
mark of Rent to the said Abbot of <HI>Covesham,</HI> and find him his lodging, Salt,
Water, and Fire, when he came to <HI>London;</HI> This was granted, a thousand one
hundred thirty three, about the thirty four of <HI>Henry</HI> the first.</P>
<P>The fair new Steeple or Bell-Tower of this Church, was begun to be builded
in the year 1421, which being finished, and a fair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of five Bells therein
placed, a sixth Bell was added, and given by <HI>John VVhitwell, Isabel</HI> his Wife, and
<HI>William Rus,</HI> or <HI>Rous</HI> Alderman; and Goldsmith, about the year 1430, which
Bell named <HI>Rus,</HI> (nightly at eight of the clock, and otherwise for Knels, and in
Peals, rung by one man by the space of 160 years) of late over-haled by four or
five at once, hath been thrice broken, and new cast, within the space of ten years,
to the charges of that Parish more than 100 marks.</P>
<P>And here note of this Steeple: Upon St. <HI>James</HI> night, certain men in the loft
next under the Bell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, ringing of a peal, a tempest of Lightning and Thunder did
<PB N="81" REF="50"/>
arise, and an ugly-shapen sight appeared to them, coming in at the South Win∣dow,
and lighted on the North, for fear whereof, they all fell down, and lay as
dead for the time, letting the Bells ring and cease of their own accord; When
the Ringers came to themselves, they found certain stones o the North Win∣dow
to be raised, and scratched, as if they had been so much Butter printed with
a Lions claw. The same stones were fastned there again, and so remain till this
day; they may be seen to this day, together with the holes where the claws
had entred, three or four inches deep.</P>
<P>At the same time, certain main Timber posts at <HI>Queen-Hith,</HI> were scratched
and cleft from top to the bottome; and the <HI>Pulpit-crosse</HI> in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church∣yard,
was likewise scratcht, cleft, and overturned; One of the Ringers lived in
Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time, who would verifie the same to be true to his know∣ledge.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Fabian</HI> Alderman, and Chronicler of <HI>England,</HI> lieth buried in this
Church, with divers others persons of note.</P>
<P>This Parish Church hath on the South side thereof a handsome Cloyster, and a
fair Church-yard, with a Pulpit-cross, not much unlike to that in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church∣yard;
Sir <HI>John Rudstone</HI> Mayor, caused the same Pulpit-crosse in his life time
to be builded, the Church-yard to be enlarged, by ground purchased of the
next Parish; and also hansome Houses to be raised, for lodging of <HI>Quire men,</HI>
such as at that time were assitants to Divine Service, then daily sung by note in
that Church.</P>
<P>Then have ye <HI>Burchover</HI> Lane, so called of <HI>Burchover</HI> the first builder, and
owner thereof, now corruptly called <HI>Birchin</HI> Lane; the North half whereof, is
the said <HI>Cornhill</HI> Ward, the other half is of <HI>Langborn</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>This Lane and the High-street neer adjoyning, hath been of old inhabited
(for the most part) with wealthy <HI>Drapers,</HI> in whose room now <HI>Mercers</HI> and <HI>Silk∣men</HI>
are come; from <HI>Birchover</HI> Lane, on that side the street down to the Stocks,
in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, had ye (for the most part) dwelling there,
<HI>Frippers</HI> or Upholders, that sold Apparrel and old houshold stuff.</P>
<P>The <HI>Popes-head</HI> Taverne, with other Houses adjoyning, strongly buil∣ded
of Stone, hath of old time been all in one, appertaining to some
great Estate, or rather to the King of this Realm, as may be supposed, both
by largenesse thereof, and by the Armes, to wit, three <HI>Leopards passant gar∣dant,</HI>
which was the whole Arms of <HI>England,</HI> before the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI>

At the South West corner of <HI>Limestreet,</HI> standeth a fair Parish Church of St.

three water-Budgets, and his Crest a Morions head, graven in the stone-work

<P>Also <HI>John Darby,</HI> Alderman, added thereunto, a fair Ile or Chappel on the

<P>On this North side of <HI>Thames-street,</HI> is St. <HI>Mary Hill Lane,</HI> up to St. <HI>Mar∣garets</HI>

Touching the principal Ornaments within this Ward, on the South side of

<P>The next is <HI>Billinsgate,</HI> whereof the whole Ward taketh name, the which

Wheat, Rie, and Grain of divers sorts, for service of the City, and the parts of

when the Queens <HI>Hith</HI> was used, as being appointed by the Kings of this
Realm, to be the special or only Port, for taking up of all such kind of Mat∣chandizes,
brought to this City by strangers and Forraigners, because the Draw-Bridge
of Timbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at <HI>London</HI> Bridge, was then to be raised, and drawn up for
passage of Ships, with tops to the said Queen <HI>Hith.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the ancient Customs of <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the
third; every great Ship landing there, paid for standage, two pence, every little
Ship with orelocks, a peny: the lesser Boat, called a Battle, a half-peny; of two
quarters of Corn measured, the King was to have one farthing; of a Combe of
Corn, a peny, of every weight going out of the City, a half peny, of two quar∣ters
of Sea-Coals measured, a farthing; and of every Tun of Ale, going out of
<HI>England,</HI> beyond the Seas, by Marchants strangers, four pence; of every thou∣sand
Herrings, a farthing, except the Franchises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Next to this is, <HI>Sommers</HI> Key, which likewise took that name, of one <HI>Som∣mer,</HI>
dwelling there, as did <HI>Lyon Key,</HI> of one <HI>Lyon,</HI> owner thereof, and since of
the Signe of the Lyon.</P>
<P>Then is there a fair Wharf or Key, called <HI>Buttolphs-gate,</HI> by that name so
called, in the time of <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> and before him, of <HI>Edward</HI> the
<HI>Confessor.</HI></P>
<P>Next is the Parish of St. <HI>Buttolph,</HI> a comely Church, and hath had many fair
Monuments therein, now much defaced and gone; Among others, there is
<HI>William Rainwel</HI> and his Sonne, who gave a Stone-House to be a Vestry to that
Church; with Lands and Tenements to discharge <HI>Billingsgate, Dowgate,</HI> and
<HI>Algate,</HI> of fifteens granted to the King, and other Tolls: this was about the
year 1426.</P>
<P>This Parish of St. <HI>Buttolph,</HI> is no great thing; notwithstanding, divers stran∣gers
are there harboured, as may appear by a presentment, not many years since
made, of strangers Inhabitants in the Ward of <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> in these
words.</P>
<P>In Billingsgate Ward, were one and fifty Housholds of strangers, whereof
thirty of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Housholders, inhabited in the Parish of <HI>St. Buttolph,</HI> in the chief
and principal Houses, where they give twenty pounds a year, for an house let∣ten,
used to be let before for four marks: the nearer they dwell to the Water
side▪ the more they give for Houses; and within 30. years before, there was
not in the whole Ward above three <HI>Nether landers;</HI> at which time, there was
within the said Parish, levied for the help of the poor, seven and twenty pounds
by the year; but since they came so plentifully thither, there cannot be ga∣thered
above eleven pounds; the strangers being exempted, to contribute to
such charges as other Citizens do, in regard they much advance the Trade of
the City.</P>
<P>On the North side is <HI>Bosse Alley,</HI> so called of a Bosse of Spring-water, conti∣nually
running, which standeth by <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> against this Alley; and was
sometimes made by the Executors of <HI>Richard Whittington.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="53"/>
Then is <HI>St. Mary Hill ane</HI> which runneth up North from Billingsgate, to the
end of <HI>St. Margaret</HI> Patte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, commonly called <HI>Rood-lane;</HI> and the greatest half
of that Lane, is also of Billingsgate Ward. In this <HI>St. Mary</HI> Hill lane, is the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parish Church of <HI>St. Mary on the Hill,</HI> called so, because of the ascent from
Billingsgate.</P>
<P>In the year 1497. in the Moneth of <HI>April,</HI> as labourers digged for the foun∣dation
of a Wall, within the Church of St. <HI>Mary Hill,</HI> near unto <HI>Billingsgate,</HI>
they found a Coffin of rotten Timber, and therein the Corps of a Woman,
whole of skin, and of bones undissevered, with the joynts of her Arms, ply∣able,
without breaking of the skin, upon whose Sepulcher this was en∣graven.</P>
<P>Here lie the Bodies of <HI>Richard Hackney,</HI> Fishmonger, and <HI>Alice</HI>
his Wife; The which <HI>Richard,</HI> was Sheriff, in the fifteenth of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the second.</P>
<P>Her Body was kept above ground three or four dayes, without noyance;
but then it waxed unsavory, and was again buried.</P>
<P>This Lane on both sides, is furnished with fair Houses for Marchants, and
hath at the North end thereof, one other Lane, called St. <HI>Margaret Pattens,</HI>
because of old time, <HI>Pattens</HI> were usually there made and sold; but of latter
time, this is called <HI>Rood Lane,</HI> of a Rood there placed, in the Church-yard of
St. <HI>Margaret,</HI> whilest the old Church was taken down, and again new builded;
during which time, the oblations made to this <HI>Rood,</HI> were imployed towards
building of the Church; But in the year 1538. about the 23. of <HI>May</HI> in the
morning, the said Rood was found to have been in the night preceding (by
people unknown) broken all to pieces; together, with the Tabernacle, where∣in
it had bin placed.</P>
<P>Then have ye another Lane, called <HI>Rother Lane,</HI> or <HI>Red Rose Lane,</HI> of such a
signe there, now commonly called <HI>Pudding Lane,</HI> because the Butchers of <HI>East-Cheape,</HI>
have their Scalding-house for Hoggs there, &amp; their Puddings, with other
fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of Beasts, are voided down that way to their Dung-boats on the <HI>Thames:</HI>
In this Church you have the Sepulchers of sundry worthy men, among other
of Mr. <HI>Vandepute,</HI> a very worthy Marchant, whose Son Mr. <HI>Giles Vandepute,</HI> was
lately buried also there.</P>
<P>Then on the West side of St. <HI>Mary Hill</HI> Church, is a Lane called <HI>Rope-lane</HI> of
old, and after <HI>Lucas-lane,</HI> but now <HI>Love-lane;</HI> Then have you the Parish of St.

<P>In <HI>Grass-street,</HI> have ye one fair Conduit of sweet water, castellated with crest

his Testament a hundred Marks towards the conveyance of water to this place;
it was begun by his Executors in the year 1491, and finished of his goods, what∣soever
it cost.</P>
<P>On the East side of this Bridge Ward, have ye the fair Parish Church of Saint
<HI>Magnus,</HI> in the which Church have been buried many men of good repute,
whose Monuments are now for the most part defaced. Among others Sir <HI>Rich∣ard

<HI>Rochester,</HI> both born in <HI>Wales</HI> about the year 1556.</P>
<P>Then is the Parish Church of St. <HI>Margarets Fish-shreet</HI> Hill; a proper Church,
but Monument it hath none of any note.</P>
<P>Up higher on this Hill, is the Parish Church of St. <HI>Leonard Milk-Church,</HI> so

<P>Then higher in <HI>Grasse-street,</HI> is the Parish Church of St. <HI>Bennet</HI> called <HI>Grass-Church,</HI>

<P>The Customes of <HI>Grasse-Church</HI> Market, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as

<P>On the West side of this Ward, at the North end of <HI>London</HI> Bridge, is a part

<P>These Fishmongers were sometimes of two several Companies, to wit, <HI>Stock-Fishmongers</HI>
and <HI>Salt-Fishmongers.</HI> Of who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e antiquity we read that by the name
of <HI>Fishmongers</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> they were for fore-stalling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contrary to the Laws
and constitutions of the City, fined to the King at 500 Marks, the eighteenth of
King <HI>Edward</HI> the first; Moreover, that the said <HI>Fishmongers</HI> hearing of the great
victory obtained by the same King against the <HI>Scots,</HI> in the six &amp; twentieth of his
Reign, made a Triumphant and solemn Shew through the City, with divers Pa∣geants,
and more than a thousand Horsemen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>These two Companies of <HI>Stock-Fishmongers</HI> and <HI>Salt-Fishmongers,</HI> of old time
had their severall Halls, to wit, in <HI>Thames</HI> street twain, in New Fish-street
twai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in Old Fish-street twain, in each place one for either Company, in all
six several Halls; the Company was so great, that it lies upon Records, that
these <HI>Fishmongers</HI> have been jolly Citizens, and six Mayors have been of their
Company in the space of four and twenty years, to wit, <HI>Walter Turk 1350,
John Lofkin 1359, John Wreth, 1361, John Pechie 1362, Simon Morden</HI> 1369, and
<HI>William Wallworth</HI> 1374.</P>
<P>It followed, that in the year 1382, through the Counsel of <HI>John North hampton</HI>
Draper, then being Mayor, <HI>VVilliam Essex, John More</HI> Mercer, and
<HI>Richard Northbury</HI> the said <HI>Fishmongers</HI> were greatly troubled, hindred of their
Liberties, and almost destroyed by combinations made against them, so that
in a Parliament at <HI>London,</HI> the controversie depending between the Mayor and
Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> and the Fishmongers, <HI>Nic. Exton</HI> Speaker for the Fish∣mongers,
prayeth the King to receive him and his Company into his protecti∣on
for fear of corporal hurt, whereupon it was commanded, either part to keep
the peace, upon pain of losing all they had; Hereupon, a Fishmonger starting
up, replyed, that the complain brought against them by the movers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was
but matter of malice, for that the Fishmongers, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d.
being chief Officers of the City, had for their misdemeanors then done, com∣mitted
the chief exhibitors of those Petitions to prison. In this Parliament the
Fishmongers (by the Kings Charter Patents) were restored to their Liberties;
Notwithstanding, in the year next following 1383, <HI>John Cavendish</HI> Fishmon∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,
craveth the peace against the Chancellour of <HI>England,</HI> which was gran∣ted,
and he put in Sureties, the Earls of <HI>Stafford</HI> and <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and challengeth
the Chancellour for taking a bribe of ten pounds, for favour of <HI>Cavendish</HI> Case,
which the Chancellour by Oath upon the Sacrament avoideth. In further triall,
it was found, that the Chancellours man (without his Masters privity) had
taken it; whereupon <HI>Cavendish</HI> was Judged to prison, and to pay the Chan∣cellour
1000 Marks for slandering him.</P>
<P>After this, many of the Nobles assembled at <HI>Reading,</HI> to supprese the sedi∣tious
Sheirs of the said <HI>John Northampion,</HI> or Combarton, late Mayor, that
had attempted great and hainous enterprises, of the which he was convict;
and when he stood mute nor would utter one word, it was Decreed, that he
should be committed to perpetual prison, his goods confiscate to the Kings
use, and that he should not come within a hundred miles of <HI>London,</HI> during
his life; He was therefore sent to the Castle of <HI>Fintegall</HI> in the Confines of
<HI>Cornwall;</HI> and in the mean space the Kings Servants spoiled his goods: <HI>John
Moore, Richard Northbury,</HI> and others were likewise there Convict, and con∣demned
to perpetual prison, and their good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> confiscate, for certain Congregati∣ons
by them made against the Fishmongers in the City of <HI>London,</HI> as is aforesaid,
<PB N="89" REF="54"/>
but they<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obtained and had the Kings pardon in the fourteenth of his
Reign, as appeareth upon Record and thus were all these troubles ap∣pealed.</P>
<P>Those <HI>Stock-Fishmongers</HI> and <HI>Salt-Fishmongers</HI> were united in the year 1536,
the eight and twentieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, their Hall to be but one, in the
House given unto them by Sir <HI>Iohn Cornwall,</HI> Lord <HI>Fanhope,</HI> and of <HI>Ampthull,</HI>
in the Parish of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> in <HI>Crooked</HI> Lane, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the

<P>Thus much was thought remarkable to be spoken of the Fishmongers, men
ignorant of their Antiquities, and not able to shew a reason why, or when they
were in amity with the <HI>Goldsmiths,</HI> do give part of <HI>their Arms, &amp;c.</HI> Neither
to say ought of Sir <HI>William Walworth</HI> (the Glory of their Company) more than
that he slew <HI>Jack Straw,</HI> which some do question: for the said <HI>Straw</HI> was after
the overthrow of the Rebels, taken, and by judgement of the Mayor beheaded,
whose confession at the Gallows is extant in Mr. <HI>Stows Annales,</HI> where also is
set down the most valiant and praise-worthy act of Sir <HI>William Walworth,</HI> a∣gainst
the principal Rebel <HI>Wat Tyler.</HI></P>
<P>On that South side of <HI>Thames</HI> street, have ye <HI>Drink-water</HI> Wharf, and <HI>Fish</HI>

<P>Then at the upper end of <HI>New Fish-street,</HI> is a Lane turning towards St. <HI>Mi∣chaels</HI>

(or rather at break-fast; for it was after the Watch was broken up, betwixt

<P>And to prove this <HI>East-Cheape</HI> to be a place replenished with Cooks, it may

<P><HI>Candlewright</HI> (so called in old Records, of the <HI>Guild-hall</HI> of St. <HI>Mary Overies,</HI>

Chaundlers, or Makers of Candles, both of Wax and Tallow, for Candle-wright
is a Maker of Candles, and of Wick, which is the Cotton, or yarn thereof,
or otherwise which is the place where they used to work them, as scalding wick
by the Stocks-Market, was called of the Poulterers dressing and scalding their
Poultry there. And in divers Countries, Dairy-houses, or Cottages, wherein
they make Butter and Cheese, are usually called <HI>Wickes.</HI> There dwelled also of
old time, divers Weavers of Woollen Clothes, brought in by <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>3d;</HI>
for I read that in the four and twentieth of his Reign, the Weavers, brought
out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> were appointed their meetings to be in the Church-yard of St.
<HI>Lawrence Poultney;</HI> and the Weavers of <HI>Brabant,</HI> in the Church-yard of St. <HI>Mary
Sommerset:</HI> There were then in this City, Weavers of divers sorts, to wit, of
Drapery or Tapery, and Nappery: these Weavers of <HI>Candlewicke</HI> street, being
in short time worn out, their place is now possessed by rich <HI>Drapers,</HI> Sellers
of Woollen Cloth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>On the Northside of this Ward, at the West end of <HI>East-Cheape,</HI> have ye St.
<HI>Clements</HI> Lane; a part whereof, (on both sides) is of <HI>Candlewicke</HI> street Ward,
to wit, somewhat North, beyond the Parish Church of St. <HI>Clement</HI> in <HI>East-cheape.</HI>
Though this Church be small, yet there are some comely Monuments in it, a∣mong
others of <HI>William Chartney,</HI> and <HI>William Overy,</HI> who founded a Chantry
there.</P>
<P>Next is St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Lane, for the most part on both sides, of this Ward, al∣most
to St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="55"/>
Then is <HI>Abchurch</HI> Lane, which is on both sides, almost wholly of this Ward:
the Parish Church there (called of St. <HI>Mary Abchurch, Apechurch,</HI> or <HI>Upchurch,</HI>
as I have read it) standeth somewhat near unto the South end thereof, on a ri∣sing
ground. It is a fair Church, <HI>Simon de Winchcombe,</HI> sounded a Chauntery
there, the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>Richard</HI> the <HI>2d, Iohn Littleton</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded another, and <HI>Thomas
Hondon</HI> another.</P>
<P>Here are likewise some remarkable Monuments, particularly of Sir <HI>Iames,</HI>
and Sir <HI>Iohn Branch,</HI> both Lord Mayors of <HI>London,</HI> about the year
1570.</P>
<P>On the South side of this Ward, beginning again at the East, is St. <HI>Michaels</HI>
lane; which lane is almost wholly of this Ward, on both sides down towards
Thames street; to a Well or Pump there; on the East side of this Lane is
<HI>Crooked</HI> Lane aforesaid, by St. <HI>Michaels</HI> Church, towards <HI>New Fishstreet.</HI> One
of the most ancient Houses in this Lane, is called the <HI>Leaden Porch,</HI> and be∣longed
sometime to Sir <HI>John Merston,</HI> Knight, the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>4th;</HI> It is
now called the <HI>Swan</HI> in <HI>Crooked</HI> Lane, possessed of strangers, and retailing of
<HI>Rhenish</HI> Wine. The Parish Church of this <HI>St. Michaels,</HI> was sometime but a
small and homely thing, standing upon part of that ground, wherein now
standeth the Parsonage House, and the ground thereabout was a filthy plot, by
reason of the Butchers in East-Cheape, who made the same their Lay∣stall.</P>
<P><HI>VV. de Burgo,</HI> gave two Messuages to that Church in <HI>Candlewick</HI> street, 1317.
<HI>John Loveken,</HI> Stock-fish monger, fout times Maior, builded (in the same
ground) this fair Church of <HI>St. Michael,</HI> and was there buried in the Quire, un∣der
a fair Tombe, with the Images of him and his Wise in Alabaster: the said
Church hath bin since increased, with a new Quire, and side Chappels by Sir
W. <HI>Walworth,</HI> Stock-fishmonger, Maior, sometime Servant to the said <HI>John
Loveken;</HI> Also the Tombe of <HI>Loveken</HI> was removed, and a flat stone of gray
marble, garnished with Plates of Copper, laid on him, as it yet remaineth in
the Body of the Church.</P>
<P>This <HI>William Walworth</HI> is reported by some, to have slain <HI>Jack Straw;</HI> but
<HI>Jack Straw</HI> being afterward taken, was first adjudged by the said Mayor, and
then executed by the losse of his head in <HI>Smithfield:</HI> True it is, that this <HI>Wil∣liam
Walworth,</HI> being a man wise, learned, and of an incomparable Manhood,
arrested <HI>Wat Tyler,</HI> a presumptuous Rebel, upon whom no man durst lay hand,
whereby he delivered the King and Kingdom, from most wicked Tyranny of
Traytors: the Mayor arrested him on the head with a sound blow; whereupon,
<HI>Wat Tylar</HI> furiously stroke the Mayor with his Dagger, but hurt him not, by
reason he was well armed, The Maior having received his stroke drew his Ba∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>liard,
and grievously wounded <HI>Wat</HI> in the Neck; and withall, gave him a
great blow on the Head; in the which Conflict, an Esquire of the Kings House,
called <HI>John Cavendish,</HI> drew his Sword, and wounded <HI>Wat</HI> twice or thrice, even
to the death, and <HI>Wat</HI> spurring his Horse, cryed to the Commons to revenge
him: the Horse beats him about eighty foot from the place, and there he fell
down half dead, and by and by, they which attended on the King, environed
him about, so as he was not seen of his Company; many of them thrust him
in, in divers places of his Body, and drew him into the Hospital of St. <HI>Bartho∣lomew;</HI>
from whence again the Maior caused him to be drawn into <HI>Smithfield,</HI>
and there to be beheaded: In reward of his Service, (the people being dis∣persed)
the King commanded the Maior to put a <HI>Basenet</HI> on his Head; and the
Mayor requesting why he should so do, the King answered, he being much
bound unto him, would make him <HI>Knight;</HI> The Mayor answered, that he was
neither worthy, nor able to take such an Estate upon him; for he was but a
<HI>Marchant,</HI> and had to live by his Marchandize only: Notwithstanding, the
<HI>King</HI> made him to put on his <HI>Basenet,</HI> and then with a Sword in both his hands,
<PB N="82" REF="56"/>
he strongly struck him on the Neck, as the manner was then, and the same day
he made three other Citizens <HI>Knights</HI> (for his sake) to wit, <HI>John Philpot, Ni∣cholas
Brember,</HI> and <HI>Robert Launde,</HI> Aldermen. The <HI>King</HI> gave to the Maior, a
hundred pound Land by year, and to each of the other forty pound Land, year∣ly,
to them and their-Heires for ever.</P>
<P>After this, in the same year, the said Sir <HI>William Walworth,</HI> founded in the
said Parish Church of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> a Colledge, of a Master and nine Priests, or
Chaplains, and deceasing 1385. was there buried in the North Chappel by the
Quire; but his Monument being (amongst other by bad people) defaced in
the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth; and again, since renewed by the Fishmongers,
for lack of knowledge, whatsoever before had been written in this Epitaph,
they followed a fabulous Book, and wrote <HI>Iack Straw,</HI> instead of <HI>Wat
Tylar.</HI></P>
<P>It hath also been, and is now grown to a common opinion, that in reward
of this service done by the said <HI>William Wallworth,</HI> against the Rebel, that King
<HI>Richard</HI> added to the Arms of this City (which was Argent, a plane Crosse
Gules) a Sword, or Dagger, (for so they terme it) whereof Mr. <HI>Iohn Stow</HI>
makes a doubt; but to the contrary, he alledgeth, that in the fourth year of
<HI>Richard</HI> the second, in a full Assembly made in the upper Chamber of the
<HI>Guild-hall,</HI> summoned by this <HI>William Walworth,</HI> then Mayor, as well of Alder∣men,
as of the Common Councel, in every Ward, for certain affaires concer∣ning
the King, it was there by common consent agreed and ordained, that the
old Seal of the Office of the <HI>Majoralty</HI> of the City, being very small, old, un∣apt,
and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omely for the Honour of the City, should be broken, and one
other new should be had, which the said Mayor commanded to be made arti∣ficially,
and honourably for the exercise of the said Office thereafter, in place
of the other. In which new Seal, besides the Images of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> which
of old were rudely engraven, there should be under the feet of the said Ima∣ges,
a Shield of the Arms of the said City, perfectly graven with two <HI>Lyons</HI>
supporting the same, and two Serjeants of Arms; in the other part, one, and
two Tabernacles; in which, above, should stand two Angels, between whom
(above the said Images of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul)</HI> should be set the <HI>Glorious Virgin.</HI> This
being done, the old Seal of the Office was delivered to <HI>Richard Odiham,</HI> Cham∣berlain,
who brake it, and in placethereof, was delivered the new Seal to the
said Mayor, to use in his Office of Majoralty, as occasion should require.</P>
<P>This new Seal seemeth to be made before <HI>William Walworth</HI> was Knighted;
for he is not there intituled Sir, as afterwards he was; and certain it is, that
the same new Seal then made, is now in use, and none other in that Office of
the Majoralty, which may suffice to answer the former supposition, without
shewing of any evidence sealed with the old Seal, which was the <HI>Crosse,</HI> and
<HI>Sword</HI> of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and not the Dagger of <HI>William Walworth.</HI> In this Church
are sundry ancient Monuments, of Mayors and Sheriffs of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>West from this St. <HI>Michaels</HI> Lane, is St. <HI>Martins Orgar</HI> Lane, by <HI>Candlewick</HI>-street,
which lane is, on both sides down to a Well, replenished with fair and
large Houses for Marchants; and it is of this Ward. One of which Houses was
sometime called <HI>Beauchamps Inne,</HI> as pertaining unto them of that Family.
<HI>Thomas Arundel,</HI> Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> commonly, for his time was lodged
there.</P>
<P>The Parish Church of St. <HI>Martin Orgar,</HI> is a small thing. <HI>William Crowmer,</HI>
Maior, builded a proper Chappel on the South side thereof, and was buried
there in an ancient Tombe 1533. where are some others, of Maiors and
Aldermen.</P>
<P>Then is there one other Lane, called St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> of the Parish Church
there. This Lane, down to the South side of the Church-yard, is of <HI>Candlewick</HI>
street VVard.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="56"/>
The Parish Church of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> was increased with a Chappel of Jesus, by
<HI>Thomas Cole,</HI> for a Master and Chaplain; the which Chappel and Parish Church,
was made a Colledge of <HI>Iesus,</HI> and of <HI>Corpus Christi,</HI> for a Master and seven
Chaplains, by <HI>Iohn Poultney</HI> Maior, and was confirmed by <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the
twentieth of his Raign; of him was this Church called St. <HI>Laurence</HI> Poultney
in Candlewick street; which Colledge was valued at seventy nine pounds, se∣venteen
shillings eleven pence, and was surrendred in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the
sixth.</P>
<P>In this Church, <HI>Robert</HI> and <HI>Henry Radcliffe,</HI> Earls of <HI>Sussex,</HI> lie buried.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Twelfth Ward, or Aldermanry
of the City of LONDON,
called Wallbrook Ward.</HEAD>
<P>WE will now proceed, and make a Perambulation of <HI>Walbrook VVard,</HI>
which beginneth at the vvest end of <HI>Candlewick Street VVard,</HI> It run∣neth
down <HI>Candlewick street,</HI> vvest toward <HI>Budge Rowe;</HI> It hath on the
North side thereof, St. <HI>Swithens Lane,</HI> so called of St. <HI>Swithens,</HI> a Parish Church
by <HI>London-stone;</HI> This Lane is replenished (on both the sides) with fair builded
Houses, and is vvholly of <HI>VVallbrook VVard.</HI> The said Parish Church of St.
<HI>Sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>then,</HI> standeth at the South vvest corner of this Lane; Licence vvas procu∣red,
to new build and increase the said Church and Steeple, in the year 1420.
Sir <HI>Iohn Hend</HI> Draper, and Maior, was an especial Benefactor thereunto, as ap∣peareth
by his Arms in the Glasse vvindows, even in the tops of them, which is
in a Field Argent, a Chief Azure, a Lyon passant Argent, a Cheueron Azure,
three Escalops Argent; <HI>Ralph Ioceline,</HI> Maior of <HI>London,</HI> among others, hath a
Monument in this Church, having bin a benefactor to it.</P>
<P>On the South side of this high street, near unto the Channel, is pitched up∣right
a great stone, called <HI>London stone,</HI> fixed in the ground very deep, fastned
with Barres of Iron, and otherwise so strongly set, that if Carts do run against it,
through negligence, the VVheels be broken, and the Stone it self unshaken.
The cause vvhy this Stone was there set, the time when, or other memory there∣of
is none, but that the same hath long continued there, is manifest, namely since
(or rather before) the Conquest; for in the end of a fair written Gospel Book,
given to <HI>Christs Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by <HI>Ethelstane,</HI> King of the vvest <HI>Saxons,</HI>
mention is made of Lands and Rents in <HI>London,</HI> belonging to the said Church,
whereof one parcel is described to lie near unto <HI>London Stone.</HI> Of latter time
we read, that in the year of Christ 1135. the first of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> a fire, which
began in the house of one <HI>Ailward,</HI> near unto <HI>London, stone,</HI> consumed all East
to <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> in which fire the Priory of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> was burnt, and vvest to
St. <HI>Erkenwalds</HI> shrine in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, and these be the Eldest Notes that I read
thereof.</P>
<P>Some have said, this stone to be set there, as a Mark in the middle of the Ci∣ty
within the Wall, but in truth it standeth far nearer to the River of <HI>Thames,</HI>
than to the Wall of the City.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="57"/>
Some others have said, the same to be set, for the tendering and making of
payment by Debtors to their Creditors, at their appointed dayes and times,
till of latter time, payments were more usually made at the <HI>Font</HI> in <HI>Ponts
Church,</HI> and now most commonly at the <HI>Royal Exchange;</HI> Some again have
imagined, the same to be set up by <HI>Iohn</HI> or <HI>Thomas London-stone</HI> dwelling there
against it; but more likely it is, that such men have taken name of the Stone,
than the Stone of them: as did <HI>John</HI> at <HI>Noke,</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> at <HI>Stile, William</HI> at
<HI>Wall</HI> or at <HI>Well</HI> &amp;c. But the most probable opinion, is, that it was placed there by
the <HI>Romans</HI> for a <HI>Milliare,</HI> as was observed elswhere in this Discourse.</P>
<P>Down West from this Parish Church, and from <HI>London-stone,</HI> have ye <HI>Wall∣broke</HI>
corner, from whence runneth up a street North to the <HI>Stocks</HI> called <HI>Wal∣brook;</HI>
because it standeth on the East side of the same Brook by the Bank
thereof, and the whole Ward taketh name of that street. On the East side of
this street, and at the North corner thereof, is the <HI>Stocks</HI> Market, which had
this beginning. About the year of Christ 1282, <HI>Henry Wallis</HI> Mayor, caused divers
houses in this City to be builded towards the maintenance of <HI>London-Bridge,</HI>
namely, in one void place neare unto the Parish Church called <HI>Wooll-Church;</HI>
On the North side thereof, where sometime (the way being very large and
broad) had stood a pair of <HI>Stocks</HI> for punishment of offenders; This building
took name of those <HI>Stooks,</HI> and was appointed (by him) to be a Market-place
for Fish &amp; Flesh, in the midst of the City: other Houses be builded in other pla∣ces,
by Patent of <HI>Edward</HI> the first it doth appear, dated the tenth of his Reign.</P>
<P>After this, in the year 1322, the seventeenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, a Decree
was made by <HI>Hamond Chickwell</HI> Mayor, that none should sell fish or flesh, out
of the Markets appointed, to wit, <HI>Bridge-street, East-cheap, Old Fish-street,</HI> St.
<HI>Nicholas Shambles,</HI> and the said <HI>Stocks,</HI> on pain to forfeit such <HI>fish</HI> or <HI>flesh</HI> as were
there sold, for the first time; and the second time to lose their Freedom: Which
Act was made by commandment of the King, under his <HI>Letters Patents,</HI> dated at
the <HI>Tower</HI> the 17th of his Reign, &amp; then was this <HI>Stocks</HI> let to Farm for forty six
pounds thirteen shillings four pence by year: this <HI>Stocks Market</HI> was again be∣gun
to be builded, in the year 1410, in the eleaventh of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and
was finished in the year next following. In the year 1507, the same was rented
fifty six pounds nineteen shillings ten pence; And in the year 1543, <HI>John
Cotes</HI> being Mayor, there was in this <HI>Stocks Market,</HI> for <HI>Fishmongers</HI> five and
twenty Boards or Stalls, rented yearly to 34 pounds, 13 shillings. 4 pence.
There was for Butchers 18 Boards or stalls rented at 41 pounds, 16 shillings 4
pence, and there were also Chambers above sixteen, rented at five pounds, thir∣teen
shillings four pence, in all, eighty two pounds three shillings.</P>
<P>Next unto this <HI>Stocks</HI> is the Parish Church of St. <HI>Mary VVool-Church,</HI> so cal∣led
of a Beam placed in the Church-yard, which was thereof called <HI>Wool-Church
Haw,</HI>
of the Tronage or weighing of Wooll there used, and to verifie this, we
find amongst the Customs of <HI>London</HI> written in <HI>French,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI>
the second, a Chapter intituled, <HI>Les Customes de VVooll-Church Haw,</HI> wherein
is set down, what was there to be paid for every parcel of Wooll weighed; this
Tronage, or weighing of Wooll, till the sixth of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, was there
continued: <HI>John Church-man</HI> then builded the Custome-house upon <HI>VVooll
Key,</HI> to serve for the said Tonnage as is before shewed in <HI>Tower-street</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>This Church is reasonable fair and large, and was afterwards new builded,
by Licence granted in the twentieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, with condition to be
builded fifteen foot from the <HI>Stocks</HI> Market, for sparing of light to the said <HI>Stocks,</HI>
the Parson of this Parish is to have four Marks the year, for Tyth of the said
<HI>Stocks,</HI> paid him by the Masters of the Bridge-house, by a special Decree, made
the second of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh. In the year about 1500, <HI>John VVingar</HI> Lord
Mayor, gave two Basons of silver to this Church; And <HI>Richard Shore</HI> Sheriff of
<HI>London</HI> made the Porch at the West end: they lye both there entombed.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="57"/>
From the <HI>Stocks Market,</HI> and this Parish Church East, up into <HI>Lombard∣street,</HI>
some four or five houses on a side, and also on the South side of <HI>VVooll-Church</HI>
have ye <HI>Bear-Binder</HI> Lane, a part whereof is of this <HI>VVallbrook</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>Then down sower in the street called <HI>Wallbrook,</HI> is one other fair Church of
St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> builded new on the East side thereof; for the old Church stood on
the West side, in place where now standeth the <HI>Parsonage</HI> House, and there∣fore
so much nearer to the Brook, even on the Bank.</P>
<P>This Church was finished in the year 1439. The breadth thereof is sixty se∣ven
foot, and length one hundred twenty five foot, the Church-yard ninty foot
in length, and thirty seven in breadth, and more, <HI>Robert VVhittingham</HI> (made
Knight of the Bath) in the yeer 1432, purchased the Patronage of this Church,
from <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> Unkle to <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth; and <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth,
in the second of his Reign, gave it to Sir <HI>Richard Lee</HI> then Mayor, who il∣eth

<P>Lower down from this Parish Church, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivers fair houses, namely one,
wherein of late Sir <HI>Richard Baker,</HI> a Knight of <HI>Kent</HI> was lodged; and wherein
also dwelled Mr. <HI>Thomas Gore,</HI> a Merchant famous for Hospitality.</P>
<P>On the West side of this <HI>VValbrook</HI> street, over against the <HI>Stocks</HI> Market, is a
part of the High street, called the <HI>Poultry;</HI> On the South side West, till over
against Saint <HI>Mildreds</HI> Church, and the <HI>Scalding wike,</HI> is of this Ward.</P>
<P>Then down again <HI>Wallbrook</HI> street, some small distance, in <HI>Buckles Bury,</HI> a
street so called of <HI>Buckle,</HI> that sometime was owner thereof; part of which
street on both sides, three or four Houses, to the course of the Brook, is of this
Ward, and so down <HI>VValbrook</HI> street, to the South corner, from whence West,
down <HI>Budge row,</HI> some small distance, to an Alley, and thorow that Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey South,
by the West end of St. <HI>Johns</HI> Church upon <HI>VValbrook,</HI> by the South side and
East end of the same, again to <HI>VValbrook</HI> corner. This Parish Church is called,
St <HI>John upon VValbrook,</HI> because the West end thereof is on the very bank of
<HI>Walbrook</HI> by <HI>Horshooe</HI> Bridge, in <HI>Horshooe</HI>-Bridge street.</P>
<P>This Church was also lately new builded: for about the year 1412, Licence
was granted by the Mayor and Communalty, to the Parson and Parish, for the
inlarging thereof, with a piece of ground on the North part of the Quire, one
and twenty foot in length, seventeen foot in breadth, and three inches; and on
the South side of the Quite, one foot of the common soyle.</P>
<P>On the South side of <HI>Walbrook</HI> Ward, from <HI>Candle-wick</HI> street, in the mid∣way
between <HI>London-stone</HI> and <HI>Walbrook</HI> corner, is a little Lane with a Turn-Pike
in the middest thereof, and in the same a hansome Parish Church, called
S. <HI>Mary Bothaw,</HI> or <HI>Boat-Haw,</HI> by the <HI>Erbar.</HI> This Church being near unto
<HI>Downgate,</HI> on the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> hath the addition of <HI>Bothaw</HI> or <HI>Boat-haw,</HI>
of near adjoyning to an <HI>Haw</HI> or Yard, wherein (of old time) Boats were made
and landed from <HI>Downgate</HI> to be mended, as may be supposed; for other reason
I find none, why it should be so called. This Church hath one remarkable

Lanes turning up, as shall be shewed when we come to them.</P>
<P>But first to begin with the High street called <HI>Dowgate:</HI> at the upper end there∣of,
is a fair <HI>Conduit</HI> of <HI>Thames</HI> Water, castellated, and made in the year 1568,
at the charges of the Citizens, and is called, the <HI>Conduit upon Dowgate.</HI> The de∣scent
of this stre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is such, that in the year 1574, on the fourth of <HI>September</HI> in

aro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and ran with such a swift course towards the Common-shores, that a Lad
of eighteen years old, minding to have leapt over the Channel near unto
the said Conduit, was taken with the stream, and carried from thence towards
the Thames, with such a violence, that no man, with staves, or otherwise, could
stay him till he came against a Cart-wheele, that stood in the said Water-gate;
before which time he was drowned and stark dead.</P>

at St. <HI>Mary Spittle,</HI> the other at St. <HI>Mary Bethlem</HI> without <HI>Bishopsgate. Richard</HI>
the second, in the eighteenth of his Reign, granted them to make their two Bro∣therhoods
one, by the name of the Fraternity of <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> of <HI>Skinners;</HI>
divers Royal persons were named to be Founders, and Brethren of this Frater∣nity,
to wit, <HI>Kings</HI> six, <HI>Dukes</HI> nine, <HI>Earls</HI> two, <HI>Lords</HI> one; <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs, Edward</HI> the
third, <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and <HI>Edward</HI> the
fourth.</P>
<P>This Fraternity had also once every year on <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> day afternoon a
a pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession, which passed through the principal streets of the City, wherein
was borne more than one hundred Torches of Wax, (costly garnished) burning
light, and above two hundred Clerks and Priests in Surplesses and Coaps, sing∣ing;
After the which, were the Sheriffs servants, the Clarks of the Compters,
Chaplains for the Sheriffs, the Mayors Sergeants, the Councel of the City, the
Mayor and Aldermen in Scarlet and then the <HI>Skinners</HI> in their best Liveries.</P>
<P>Then lower, was a Colledge of Priests, called <HI>Jesus Commons,</HI> a House well
furnished with Brasse, Pewter, Napery, Plate, &amp;c. besides a fair Library well
stored with Books; all which of old time were given to a number of Priests
<PB N="97" REF="58"/>
that should keep Commons there; and as one left his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace (by death or o∣therwise)
another should be admitted into his room; but this Order within
these 70. years, being discontinued, the said House was dissolved, and turned
into Tenements.</P>
<P>Down lower have ye <HI>Elbowe Lane,</HI> and at the corner thereof, was one great
Stone-house, called <HI>Old-hall;</HI> it is now taken down, and divers fair Houses of
Timber placed there: This was sometimes pertaining to <HI>William de pont le Arch,</HI>
and by him given the <HI>Priory of St. Mary Overy in Southwark,</HI> in the Reign o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Henry</HI> the first. In this <HI>Elbow-lane,</HI> is the <HI>Inholders Hall,</HI> and other fair Houses:
this Lane runneth West, and suddenly turneth South, into <HI>Thames-street,</HI> and
therefore (of that bending) is called Elbow-lane: on the East side of this
<HI>Downgate-street,</HI> is the great old House before spoken of, called the <HI>Erbar,</HI>
neere to the Church of St. <HI>Mary Bothaw; Geffery Scroop</HI> held it by the gift of
<HI>Edward</HI> the third, in the fourteenth of his Reign: It belonged since, to <HI>Iohn
Nevel, Lord of Raby;</HI> then to <HI>Richard Nevel,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick; Nevel,</HI> Earl of
<HI>Salisbury,</HI> was lodged there, 1457. Then it came to <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI>
and his Heires Males, by the gift of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, in the fourteenth yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of his Reign. It was lately builded by Sir <HI>Thomas Pull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son</HI> Maior, and was af∣terward
Inhabited by Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> that famous Navigator; Next to this
great House, is Lane turning to <HI>Bush-lane,</HI> (of old time called <HI>Carter-lane,</HI>
of Carts, and Carmen having Stables there) and now called <HI>Chequer-lane,</HI> or
<HI>Chequer-Alley,</HI> of an Inne called the Chequer.</P>
<P>In <HI>Thamesstreet,</HI> on the Thames side West from <HI>Downgate,</HI> is <HI>Greenwitch lane,</HI>
of old time so called, and now <HI>Fryer lane,</HI> of such a signe there set up.</P>
<P>In this Lane is the <HI>Ioyners Hall,</HI> and other fair Houses.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Granthams Lane,</HI> so called of <HI>Iohn Grantham,</HI> sometime Maior, and
owner thereof, whose house was very large and strong, builded of stone, as ap∣peareth
by Gates Arched yet remaining; <HI>Ralph Dodmer,</HI> first a Brewer, then
a Mercer, Maior 1529. dwelled there, and kept his Majoralty in that house: it
is now a <HI>Brew-house,</HI> as it was before.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Down-gate,</HI> whereof is spoken in another place; East from this
<HI>Downegate,</HI> is <HI>Cosin lane,</HI> named of one <HI>VVilliam Cosin,</HI> that dwelled there in
the fourth of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, as divers his Predecessors, Father, Granfa∣ther,
&amp;c. had done before him; <HI>VVilliam Cosin</HI> was one of the Sheriffs, in the
year 1306.</P>
<P>That House standeth at the South end of the Lane, having an old and Arti∣ficial
conveyance, of <HI>Thames water</HI> into it; And is now a <HI>Dye-house,</HI> called
<HI>Lambards Mess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age;</HI> Adjoyning to that House, there was lately erected an
Engine, to convey <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hames water</HI> unto <HI>Downgate</HI> Conduit aforesaid.</P>
<P>Next to this Lane, on the East, is the <HI>Steel-yard</HI> (as they terme it) a place
for Marchants of <HI>Almain,</HI> that used to bring hither, as well Wheat, Rie, and o∣ther
Grain, as Cables, Ropes, Masts, Pitch, Tarre, Flax, Hemp, Linnen Cloth▪
Wainscots, Wax, Steel, and other profitable Marchandizes; unto these Mar∣chan
sin the year 1259. <HI>Henry</HI> the third, at the Request of his Brother <HI>Richard,</HI>
Earl of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> King of <HI>Almain,</HI> granted, that all and singular the Marchants;
having a House in the City of <HI>London,</HI> commonly called <HI>Guilda Aula The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o∣nicorum,</HI>
should be maintained and upholden through the whole Realm, by a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
such freedoms, and free usages or Liberties▪ as by the King and his Noble Pro∣genitors
time they had, and enjoyed, <HI>&amp;c. Edward</HI> the first renewed and con∣firmed
that Charter of Liberties granted by his Father; And in the tenth year of
the same <HI>Edward, Henry W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llis</HI> being Mayor, a great Controversie did arise be∣tween
the said Mayor, and the Marchants of the <HI>Haunce of Almaine,</HI> about
the reparations of <HI>Bishops-gate,</HI> then likely to fall; for that the said Marchants
enjoyed divers priviledges, in respect of maintaining the said Gate, which they
now denyed to repair; for the appeasing of which controversie, the <HI>King</HI> sent
<PB N="98" REF="59"/>
his Writ to the Treasurer, and Baron of his Exchequer commanding that they
should make Inquisition thereof; Before whom the Marchants being called,
when they were not able to discharge themselves, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h they enjoyed the <HI>Liber∣ties</HI>
to them granted for the same, a precept was sent to the Maior and She∣riffs,
to distrain the said Marchants to make reparations; namely, <HI>Gerard Mar∣hod,</HI>
Alderman of the Haunce, <HI>Ralph de Cussarde</HI> a Citizen of Colen, <HI>Ludero de
Denauar,</HI> a Burgesse of <HI>Trivar, Iohn</HI> of <HI>Aras</HI> a Burgesse of <HI>Trivon, Bartram</HI> of
<HI>Hamburgh, Godestalk</HI> of <HI>Hundoudale,</HI> a Burgesse of <HI>Trivon, Iohn de Deal</HI> a
Burgesse of <HI>Munster,</HI> then remaining in the said City of <HI>London,</HI> for
themselves, and all other Marchants of the <HI>Haunce,</HI> and so they granted 210
Marks sterling, to the Maior and Citizens; and undertook, that they and their
Successors, should (from time to time) repair the said <HI>Gate,</HI> and bear the third
part of the Charges in money, and men to defend it, when need were.</P>
<P>And for this Agreement, the said Maior and Citizens, granted to the said
Marchants their liberties, which till of late they have enjoyed; as namely, a∣mongst
other, that they might lay up their Grain, which they brought into this
Realm, in Inns, and sell it in their Garners, by the space of forty dayes, after
they had laid it up; except by the Mayor and Citizens they were expresly for∣bidden,
because of Dearth, or other reasonable occasions. Also they might have
their Aldermen, as they had bin accustomed; provided alwayes, that he were
of the City, and presented to the Maior and Aldermen of the City, so oft as any
should be chosen, and should take an Oath before them, to maintain Justice in
their Courts, and to behave themselves in their Office, according to Law, and
as it stood with the Customs of the City.</P>
<P>Thus much for their priviledges, whereby it appeareth, that they were great
Marchants of Corne, brought out of the East parts hither; insomuch, that the
Occupiers of Husbandry in this Land, were en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orced to complain of them, for
bringing in such abundance, when the Corn of this Realm was at an easie price;
whereupon it was ordained by Parliament, That no person should bring into
any part of this Realm, by way of Marchandize, Wheat, Rie, or Barley, grow∣ing
out of the said Realm, when the Quarter of Wheat exceeded not the price
of <HI>six shilling eight pence, Rie four shillings the Quarter, and Barley three shillings
the Quarter,</HI> upon forfeiture one half to the <HI>King,</HI> the other half to the seisor
thereof: These Marchants of the <HI>Hawnce,</HI> had their <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> in <HI>Thames-street,</HI>
in the place aforesaid by the said <HI>Cosin-lane:</HI> Their Hall is large, buil∣ded
of Stone, with three Arched Gates towards the street; the middlemost
whereof, is far bigger than the other, and is seldom opened, the other two be
mured up, the same is now called the <HI>Old Hall.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>Richard</HI> the <HI>2d,</HI> they hired one House next adjoyning to their
<HI>Old Hall,</HI> which sometime belonged to <HI>Richard Lions,</HI> a famous <HI>Lapidary,</HI> one
of the Sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> in the 49 of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>3d;</HI> and in the <HI>4th</HI> of <HI>Richard</HI>
the <HI>2d,</HI> by the Rebels of <HI>Kent,</HI> drawn out of that House, and beheaded in <HI>West-Cheape:</HI>
This also was a great House, with a large Wharf on the <HI>Thames;</HI> and
the way thereunto was called <HI>Windgoose,</HI> or <HI>Wildgoose-lane,</HI> which is now called
<HI>Windgoose-Alley;</HI> for that the same Alley is (for the most part) builded on by
the <HI>Styliard Marchants.</HI> The Abbat of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> had a Messuage here, with a
key given to him, 34. of <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>6th.</HI></P>
<P>Then is one other great House, which sometime pertained to <HI>Iohn Rainwel,</HI>
Stock-Fishmonger, <HI>Maior,</HI> and it was by him given to the <HI>Maior</HI> and Commo∣nalty,
to the end, that the profits thereof, should be disposed in deeds of piety;
which House, in the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>4th,</HI> was c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>firmed unto the said Mar∣chants,
in manner following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>It is ordered by our Soveraign Lord, and his Parliament, that the said Mar∣chants
of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>main▪</HI> being of the Company, called the <HI>Guild-hall Theutonicorum,</HI>
(or the <HI>Flemish</HI> Geld) that now be, or hereafter shall be, shall have, hold, and enjoy to
<PB N="99" REF="59"/>
them and their Successors for ever, the said place, called the <HI>Steel-house,</HI> yiel∣ding
to the Maior and Commonalty, an annual Rent of threescore and ten pounds,
three shillings, foure pence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1551, the <HI>5th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>6th,</HI> through complaint of the <HI>Eng∣lish
Marchants,</HI> the liberty of the <HI>Steel-yard Marchants,</HI> was seized into the
<HI>Kings</HI> hands, and so it resteth.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Church-lane,</HI> at the West end of <HI>Alhollowes</HI> Church, called <HI>Alhollowds</HI>
the more in <HI>Thames-street,</HI> for a difference from <HI>Alhollowes</HI> the lesse, in the same
street; It is also called <HI>Alhollowes ad faenum in the Ropery,</HI> because Hay was sold
near thereunto, at <HI>Hay-Wharf,</HI> and Ropes of old time made and so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the high
street: This is a fair Church, with a large <HI>Cloyster</HI> on the South side thereof a∣bout
their Church-yard, but fouly defaced and ruinated. Dr. <HI>Lichfield,</HI> a learned
man, and an Authour, who died 1447. lieth here buried, with other Bene∣factors.</P>
<P>At the East end of this Church goeth down a Lane, called <HI>Hay Wharf</HI>-lane, now
lately a great Brew-house, builded there by one <HI>Pot; Hen, Compion,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Beere-Brewer,
used it, &amp; <HI>Abraham</HI> his Son, since possessed it: Then was there one other
Lane, sometime called <HI>Woolseys Gate,</HI> now out of use, for the lower part thereof,
upon the Bank of <HI>Thames,</HI> is builded by the late Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> &amp; the other
end is builded on, &amp; stopped up by the Chamberlain of <HI>London. I. Butler,</HI> Draper,
one of the Sheriffs, in the year 1420. dwelled there; He appointed his house to
be sold, and the price thereof to be given to the poor; it was of <HI>Alhollowes</HI>
Parish the lesse.</P>
<P>Then is there the said Parish-Church of <HI>Alhollowes</HI> called the Lesse,
and by some <HI>Alhollowes</HI> on the Cellars; for it standeth on Vau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts,
it is said to be builded by Sir <HI>Iohn Poultney,</HI> sometimes Mayor: The
Steeple and Quire of this Church, stand on an Arched Gate, being the entry to
a great House, called <HI>Cold Harborough,</HI> the Quire of late being fallen down, is
now again at length, in the year 1594. by the Parishioners new builded.</P>
<P>Touching this <HI>Cold Harborough,</HI> I finde, that in thirteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the
second, Sir <HI>Iohn Abel,</HI> Knight, demised, or let unto <HI>Henry Stow,</HI> Draper, all that
his Capital Messuage, called the <HI>Cold Harborough,</HI> in the Parish of <HI>All Saints ad
fanum,</HI> &amp; all the pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tenances within the Gate, with the Key which <HI>Rob. Hart∣ford</HI>
Citizen, Son to <HI>W. Hartford,</HI> had, &amp; ought, &amp; the foresaid <HI>Rob.</HI> paid for it
Rent, 335. the year. This <HI>Ro. Hartford</HI> being owner thereof, as also of other Lands
in <HI>Surrey,</HI> deceasing without issue Male, left two Daughters his Co-heires, to wit,
<HI>Idonia,</HI> married to Sir <HI>Ralph Biggot,</HI> and <HI>Maude</HI> married to Sir <HI>Stephen Cosenton</HI>
Knights, between whom the said House &amp; Lands were parted. After the which
<HI>Io. Bigot</HI> Sonne to the said Sir <HI>Ralph,</HI> &amp; Sir <HI>Iohn Cosent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell their Moyeties
of <HI>Cold Harborough</HI> unto <HI>Iohn Poultney,</HI> Sonne of <HI>Adam Poultney,</HI> the <HI>8th</HI> of
<HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>3d.</HI> This Sir <HI>John Poultney</HI> dwelling in this House, and being four
times Mayor, the said House took the name of <HI>Poultneys Inne;</HI> notwithstanding
this, Sir <HI>John Poultney,</HI> the 21. of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>3d,</HI> by his Charter gave and con∣firmed
to <HI>Humphrey de Bohune, Earl of Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> his whole Tene∣ment,
called <HI>Cold Harborough,</HI> with all the Tenements and Key adjoyning, and
appurtenances sometime pertaining to <HI>Robert de Hereford,</HI> on the way called
<HI>Hay-wharf Lane,</HI> &amp;c. for one <HI>Rose</HI> at Midsommer, to him and his Heires, for
all services, if the same were demanded, This Sir <HI>John Poultney</HI> deceased 1349.
and left issue, by <HI>Margaret</HI> his Wife, <HI>William Poultney,</HI> who dyed without is∣sue;
and <HI>Margaret</HI> his Mother was married to Sir <HI>Nicholas Lovel</HI> Knight &amp;c.
<HI>Philip</HI> St. <HI>Cleare,</HI> gave two Messuages, pertaining to this <HI>Cold Harbrough,</HI> in the
Ropery, towards the enlarging of the Parish Church, and Church-yard of <HI>Al-Saints,
called the lesse,</HI> in the 20. of <HI>Richard</HI> the second.</P>
<P>In the year 1397. the 21. of <HI>Richard</HI> the <HI>2d. John Holland,</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI>
was lodged there, and <HI>Richard</HI> the second his Brother, dined with him, it was
<PB N="100" REF="60"/>
then counted a right fair and stately house; But in the next year following, I
finde, that <HI>Edmund, Earl of Cambridge,</HI> was there lodged, notwithstanding, the
said house still retained the name of <HI>Poul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neys Inne,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the
sixth, the 26 of his Reign. It belonged since to H. <HI>Holland, Duke of Excester,</HI> and
he was lodged there, in the year 1472. In the year 1485. <HI>Richard</HI> the third, by
his Letters Patents, granted and gave to <HI>John VVrith, alias Garter,</HI> principal
<HI>King</HI> of Arms of English men, and to the rest of the <HI>Kings</HI> Heralds, and Purse∣vants
of Arms, all that Messuage, with the appurtenances called <HI>Cold Harber,</HI> in
the Parish of <HI>Al-Saints the little in London,</HI> and their Successors for ever, Dated at
<HI>VVestminster,</HI> the second of <HI>March, Anno regni sui primo,</HI> without fine or fee.
How the said <HI>Heraulds</HI> departed therewith, I have not read; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut in the Reign

<P>Then is the <HI>Dyers-hall,</HI> which Company was made a Brother-hood and a

after; until the twenty eighth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, at which time the said Mer∣chants
complained, that they could not fell their Wines, paying poundage, nei∣ther
hire Houses or Cellars to lay them in: and it was redressed by virtue of the
Kings Writ, directed to the Mayor and Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> dated at <HI>Carlaveroke</HI>

stretching forth from over against Saint <HI>Michaels</HI> Church, to and by
the North side of Saint <HI>Iames</HI> Church by <HI>Garlick Hithe,</HI> this is called, <HI>Kerion</HI>
Lane; and thus much for the bounds of the <HI>Vintry</HI> Ward. Now on the <HI>Thames</HI>
side, West from <HI>Granthams</HI> Lane, have ye <HI>Herbert</HI> Lane, or <HI>Brickles</HI> Lane, so cal∣led
of <HI>Iohn Brickles,</HI> sometimes owner thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="61"/>
Then is <HI>Simpsons</HI> Lane, of one <HI>Simpson;</HI> or <HI>Emperours head</HI> Lane, of such a Sign:
then the <HI>Three Cranes</HI> Lane, so called, not only of a Sign of three <HI>Cranes</HI> at a Ta∣verne
door, but rather of three strong <HI>Cranes of Timber</HI> placed on the Vintry
Wharf, by the Thames side, to Crane up Wines there as is aforesaid; this Lane
wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of old time, to wit, the ninth of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, called the <HI>Painted Ta∣vern</HI>
Lane, of the Tavern being painted.</P>
<P>Then next over against St. <HI>Martins</HI> Church, is a large House builded of
Stone and Timber, with Vaults for the stowage of Wines, and is called the <HI>Vin∣try;</HI>
There dwelled <HI>John Gisers</HI> Vintner, Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>Constable of the
Tower;</HI> and then was <HI>Henry Picard,</HI> Vintner, Mayor; In this house <HI>Henry Pi∣card</HI>
feasted four Kings in one day, as is shewed before.</P>
<P>Then next is <HI>Vanners</HI> Lane, so called of <HI>Vanner</HI> that was owner thereof; it
is now called <HI>Church</HI> Lane, of the coming up from St. <HI>Martins</HI> Church.</P>
<P>Next is <HI>Proad</HI>-Lane, for that the same is broader for the passage of Carts from
the <HI>Vintry</HI> Wharf, than be the other Lanes. At the Northwest corner of this
Lane, is the Parish <HI>Clarkes Hall,</HI> by them purchased, since they lost their old
Hall in <HI>Bishopsgate</HI>-street. Next is <HI>Spittle</HI>-Lane, of old time so called, since <HI>Sto∣dies</HI>-Lane,
of the owner thereof named <HI>Stodie;</HI> Sir <HI>John Stodie,</HI> Vintner and
Mayor in the year 1357 gave it, with all the Quadrant wherein <HI>Vintners</HI> Hall
now standeth, with the Tenements round about, unto the <HI>Vintners.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Vintners</HI> builded for themselves a fair Hall, and also thirteen <HI>Alms-houses</HI>
there, for thirteen poor people, which are kept of Charity Rent-free.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vintners</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> were (of old time) called <HI>Marchant Vintners of
Gascoyne,</HI> and so I read them in the Records of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, the eleventh
year, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Edward</HI> the third the ninth year; they were as well <HI>English-men</HI> as
<HI>strangers</HI> born beyond the Seas, but then subjects to the King of <HI>England,</HI> great
<HI>Burdeaux Merchants of Gascoyne</HI> &amp; <HI>French Wines,</HI> divers of them were <HI>Mayors</HI>
of this City; namely, <HI>John Adrian</HI> Vintner, <HI>Reignold</HI> at Conduit, <HI>John Oxen∣ford,
Henry Picard</HI> that feasted the Kings of <HI>England, France, Scotl and,</HI> and <HI>Cy∣pres;
John Stodie,</HI> that gave <HI>Stodies</HI> Lane to the <HI>Vintners,</HI> which four last named,
were <HI>Mayors</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and yet <HI>Gascoyne</HI> Wines were
then to be sold at <HI>London,</HI> not above fourpence, nor <HI>Rhenish</HI> Wines above six
pence the Gallon.</P>
<P>I read of <HI>Sweet Wines,</HI> that in the fiftieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Iohn Peachie,</HI>
Fishmonger was accused of, for that he procured a License for the only sale of
them in <HI>London,</HI> which he endeavoured to justifie by Law, yet he was impriso∣ned
and fined.</P>
<P>More I read, that in the sixth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, the <HI>Lombards</HI> corrupted their
<HI>Sweet Wines;</HI> when knowledge thereof came to <HI>Iohn Raynwel</HI> Mayor of <HI>London,</HI>
he (in divers places of the City) commanded the heads of the Buts and other
Vessells in the open streets, to be broken, to the number of a hundred and fifty,
so that the liquour running forth, passed through the City like a stream of rain
water, in the sight of all the people, from whence there issued a most loathsome
savour.</P>
<P>I read in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, that no <HI>Sweet VVines</HI> were brought
into this Realm but <HI>Malmsyes,</HI> by the <HI>Longobards,</HI> paying to the King for his
Licence, six shillings eight pence of every Butt, besides twelve pence for Bottel∣lage.</P>
<P>In those daies <HI>Malmsey</HI> was not to be sold above three half-pence the pint;
For proof whereof, it appeareth in the Church of St. <HI>Andrew Under-shaft</HI> that
in the year 1547, <HI>I. G.</HI> and <HI>S. K.</HI> then Church-Wardens, for eighty pints of
Malmsey spent in the Church, after one penny half penny the pint, paid at the
years end for the same ten shillings.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="61"/>
Moreover, no Sacks were sold, but <HI>Rumney,</HI> &amp; that for Medicine more than fo<SUP>r</SUP>
drink; but now many kinds of Sacks are known and used. And so much for
Wines.</P>
<P>I read further that in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, the young Prince <HI>Hen∣ry,
T.</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence, I.</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and <HI>Humphrey</HI> Duke of <HI>Glocester</HI> the
Kings sons, came to Supper amongst the Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> in the <HI>Vintry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
in the House of <HI>Lewes Iohn a Briton.</HI></P>
<P>The successors of those Vintners and Wine-drawers, that retailed by the Gal∣lons,
Pottel, quart, and pint, were all incorporated by the name of <HI>Wine-tunners,</HI>
in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and confirmed the fifteenth of <HI>Henry</HI> the
sixth.</P>
<P>Next is <HI>Palmers</HI> Lane, now called, <HI>Anchors</HI> Lane, the <HI>Plummers</HI> have their
Hall there, but are Tenants to the Vintners.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Worcester</HI> House, sometimes belonging to the Earls of <HI>Worce∣ster,</HI>
now divided into many Tenaments; The <HI>Fruiterers</HI> have there Hall
there.</P>
<P>On the Land side, is the <HI>Royal</HI> street, and <HI>Pater noster</HI> Lane, I think of old
time called the <HI>Arches,</HI> for I read, that <HI>Robert de Suffolk,</HI> gave to <HI>Walter Darford,</HI>
his Tenement with the apurtenance, in the Lane called <HI>Les Arches,</HI> in the Pa∣rish
of Saint <HI>Michael de Pater noster</HI> Church, between the Wall of the field called
<HI>Winchester field</HI> on the East, and the same Lane on the West, &amp;c.</P>
<P>More, there was a stone House called <HI>Stoda de Winton, juxta Stodum</HI> Bridge,
which in that Lane was over <HI>Walbrook</HI> water.</P>
<P>Then is the fair Parish Church of Saint <HI>Michael,</HI> called <HI>Pater noster</HI> Church, in
the <HI>Royal</HI> street; This Church was new builded, and made a <HI>Colledge</HI> of S. <HI>Spirit,</HI>
and S. <HI>Mary,</HI> founded by <HI>Richard VVhittington,</HI> Mercer, four times <HI>Mayor,</HI> for a
Master, four Fellows, Masters of Art, Clerks, Conducts, Chorists, &amp;c. and an
Alms-house, called <HI>Gods house</HI> or Hospital, for thirteen poor men, one of them
to be <HI>Tutor,</HI> and to have sixteen pence the week, the other twelve, each of them
to have fourteen pence the week for ever, with other necessary provision, an
Hutch with three Locks, with a common Seal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Licence for this foundation was granted by King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, the
eleventh of his Reign, and in the twelfth of the same Kings reign, the Mayor and
the Communalty of <HI>London,</HI> granted to <HI>Richard VVhittington,</HI> a vacant piece of
ground thereon, to build his Colledge in the <HI>Royall;</HI> all which was confirmed
by <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth the third of his Reign, to <HI>Iohn Coventry, Jenkin Carpenter,</HI>
and <HI>VVilliam Grove,</HI> Executors to to <HI>Richard Whittington.</HI></P>
<P>This foundation was again confirmed by Parliament, the tenth of <HI>Henry</HI> the
sixth, and was suppressed by the Statute of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth. The Alms-Houses,
with the poor men, do remain, and are paid by the Mercers.</P>
<P>This <HI>Richard VVhittington</HI> was (in this Church) three times buried, first, by
his Executors, under a fair Monument; then, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth,
the Parson of that Church, thinking some great riches (as he said) to be buried
with him, caused his Monument to be broken, his Body to be spoiled of his
Leaden sheet, and again the second time to be buried; And in the Reign of
Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> the Parishioners were forced to take him up, and lap him in
Lead, as afore, to bury him the third time, and to place his Monuments, or
the like, over him again, which remaineth still and so he rested.</P>
<P>Among others, Sir <HI>Thomas Tanke</HI> Knight of the Garter born in <HI>Almain,</HI> a
great Martial man, lieth buried there.</P>
<P>At the upper end of this street, is the <HI>Tower Royall,</HI> whereof that street ta∣keth
name; This Tower &amp; great place was so called, of pertaining to the <HI>Kings</HI>
of this Realm, but by whom the same was first builded, or of what Antiquity
continued, it doth not appear, more than that in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the

first, the second, fourth, and seventh year, it was the Tenement of <HI>Simon Beawmes;</HI>
Also that in the thirty sixt of <HI>Edward</HI> the third the same was called the <HI>Royal,</HI> in
the Parish of St. <HI>Michael de Pater noster,</HI> and that in the three and fortieth of
his Reign, he gave it by the name of his Inne, called the <HI>Royall,</HI> in his City of
<HI>London,</HI> in value twenty pounds by year, unto his <HI>Colledge</HI> of Saint <HI>Stephen</HI> at
<HI>Westminster:</HI> Notwithstanding, in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, it was
called the <HI>Queens Wardrobe,</HI> as appeareth by this that followeth.</P>
<P>King <HI>Richard,</HI> having in <HI>Smithfield</HI> overcome and dispersed the Rebels, He,
his Lords, and all his Company, entred the City of <HI>London</HI> with great joy, and
went to the Lady Princesse his Mother, who was then lodged in the <HI>Tower</HI>
called the <HI>Queens Wardrobe,</HI> where she had remained three daies and two
nights much affrighted; But when she saw the King her Son, she was greatly
rejoyced, <HI>Ah Son, What great sorrow have I suffered for you this day?</HI>
The King answered and said, <HI>Certainly, Madam, I know it well, but now re∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce,
and thank God, for I have this day recovered mine Heritage, and
the Realm of</HI> England, <HI>which I had near-hand lost.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Tower</HI> seemeth to have been (at that time) of good defence; for
when the Rebels had beset the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and got possession thereof,
taking from thence whom they listed, the Princesse being forced to fly, came
to this <HI>Tower-Royall,</HI> where she was lodged, and remained safe, as ye have
heard and it may be also supposed, that the King himself was at that time
lodged there.</P>
<P>I read, that in the year 1386, <HI>Lyon</HI> King of <HI>Armony,</HI> being chased out of his
Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, by the <HI>Tartarians,</HI> received innumerable gifts of the <HI>King</HI> and of his
Nobles, the King then lying in the <HI>Royall,</HI> where he also granted to the said
King of <HI>Armony,</HI> a Charter of a thousand pounds by year during his Life; This
for proof may suffice, that Kings of <HI>England</HI> have been lodged in this <HI>Tower,</HI>
though the same (afterwards) hath been neglected, and turned into <HI>stabling</HI>
for the Kings Horses, and now letten out to divers men and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivided into Tene∣ments.</P>
<P>In <HI>Horse-Bridge-street,</HI> is the <HI>Cutlers</HI> Hall, <HI>Richard de Wilehale,</HI> 1295,
confirmed to <HI>Paul Butelar</HI> this House, and Edifices, in the Parish of Saint <HI>Mi∣chael
Pater noster</HI> Church, and Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> upon <HI>Walbrook,</HI> which sometime
<HI>Lawrence Gisers,</HI> and his son <HI>Peter Gisers</HI> did possesse, and afterward <HI>Hugonis de

belonged to <HI>Simon Dolesly</HI> Grocer, and Mayor 1359, They of this Company
had (of old time) three Arts, or sorts of Workmen, to wit, the first were
<HI>Smiths, Forgers</HI> of <HI>Blades,</HI> and therefore called <HI>Bladers,</HI> and divers of them
proved wealthy men, as namely, <HI>Walter Nele</HI> Blader; one of the Sheriffs, the

but Monuments of antiquity, there are none beyond the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI>
the eighth, except some Arms in the Windows, as also in the Stone-work, which
some suppose to be of <HI>John Barnes</HI> Mercer, Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> in the year 1371,
a great builder thereof. H. <HI>Causton</HI> Merchant, was a Benefactor and had a
Chantry there about, 1396. <HI>T. Roman</HI> Mayor 1310, had also a Chantry there
1319. <HI>Fitz Williams</HI> also a Benefactor, had a Chantry there. More, Sir
<HI>William Littlesbury,</HI> aliàs <HI>Horne,</HI> (for King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth so named him)
because he was a most excellent Winder of an Horne; he was a Salter, and Mer∣chant
of the <HI>Staple,</HI> Mayor of <HI>London</HI> in the year 1487, and was buried in this
Church, having appointed (by his Testament) the Bells to be changed for four
new Bells of good tune and sound; but that was not performed: he gave five
hundred Marks towards the repairing of High-waies, between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Cam∣bridge;</HI>
his dwelling House, with a Garden and appurtenances in the said Pa∣rish,
to be sold, and bestowed in charitable actions.</P>
<P>His House called the <HI>George</HI> in <HI>Bread-street</HI> he gave to the <HI>Salters,</HI> they to find
a Priest in the said Parish, to have six pounds, thirteen shillings, four pence the
year; to every Preacher at <HI>Pauls-Crosse,</HI> and at the <HI>Spittle,</HI> four pence for

Legacies were not performed.</P>
<P>Among others, ther's one Epitaph in Greek in this Church on the Lady
<HI>Katherine Killegree.</HI></P>
<P>Then West from the said Church on the same side, was one great Messuage,
sometime called <HI>Ipres Inne</HI> of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Ipres</HI> a Flemming, the first Builder
thereof; This <HI>William</HI> was called out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> with a number of <HI>Flemmings</HI>
to the aid of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> against <HI>Maude</HI> the Empress, in the the year 1138,
and grew in favour with the said King for his service, so far, that he builded
this House near unto <HI>Tower-Royall,</HI> in the which Tower it seemeth the
King was then lodged, as in the heart of the City, for his more safe∣ty.</P>
<P><HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI> Brother to the Empresse, being taken, was com∣mitted
to the Custody of this <HI>VVilliam,</HI> to be kept in the Castle of <HI>Rochester,</HI>
till King <HI>Stephen</HI> was also taken, and then the one was delivered in exchange
for the other, and both set free.</P>
<P>This <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Ipres</HI> gave <HI>Edredes Hith,</HI> now called <HI>Queens Hith,</HI> to the

<P>In the first of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, the said <HI>William,</HI> withall the other <HI>Flem∣mings</HI>
(fearing the indignation of the new King) departed the Land, but it
seemeth that the said <HI>William</HI> was shortly called back again, and restored both
to the Kings favour, and to his old possessions here, so that the name and Fa∣mily
continued long after in this Realm.</P>
<P>On the other side, I read of a Messuage, called <HI>Kinged Hall:</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI>

<P>Now again on the North side of this high street, is <HI>Budge-row:</HI> by the East end
of St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> Church, have ye St. <HI>Sithes Lane,</HI> so called of St. <HI>Sithes Church,</HI>
(which standeth against the North end of that Lane) and this is wholly of
<HI>Cordwainer-street Ward;</HI> also the South side of <HI>Needlers lane,</HI> which reacheth
from the North end of St. <HI>Sithes lane,</HI> then vvest from St.
<HI>Anthonies</HI> Church, is the South end of <HI>Sopers lane,</HI> which lane took that name,
not of <HI>Sope-making,</HI> as some have supposed, but of <HI>Alen le Sopar,</HI> in the ninth of
<PB N="108" REF="64"/>
<HI>Edward</HI> the second; nor can we read of <HI>Sope-making</HI> in this City, till within
this hundred and fifty years, that <HI>Iohn Lambe,</HI> dwelling in <HI>Grasse-street,</HI> set up
a boyling house; for this City (in former time) was served of white Sope in
hard Cakes (called Castle-Soap, and other) from beyond the Seas, and of gray
Sope, speckled with white, very sweet and good, from <HI>Bristow,</HI> sold here for a
peny the pound, and never above peny farthing; and black Sope for an half∣peny
the pound.</P>
<P>Then in <HI>Bow-lane</HI> (as they now call it) is <HI>Goose-lane,</HI> by <HI>Bow</HI>-Church; <HI>Will<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am
Essex,</HI> Mercer, had Tenements there, in the six and twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the
third.</P>
<P>Then from the South end of <HI>Bow-lane,</HI> up <HI>Wathling-street,</HI> till over against the
<HI>Red Lyon,</HI> are the bounds of <HI>Cordwainer-street</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>Then is there a fair Parish in <HI>Budge-row,</HI> called St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> at first, and now
St. <HI>Antlins.</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Knowles</HI> Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> lyeth buried there, who
repaired, and was a great Benefactor to that Church, upon whom is this
Epitaph,
<Q><L>Here lyeth graven under this Stone,</L>
<L><HI>Thomas Knowles,</HI> both flesh and bone, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>Next on the South side of <HI>Budge-row,</HI> by the West corner thereof, and on the
East side of <HI>Cordwainer-street,</HI> is one other fair Church, called <HI>Aldermary Church,</HI>
because the same was very old, and elder then any Church of St. <HI>Mary</HI> in the
City; till of late years, the foundation of a very fair new Church, was laid
there by <HI>Henry Keeble,</HI> Grocer, and Mayor, who deceased 1518. and was ther
buried in a Vault, by him prepared, with a fair Monument raised over him, on
the North side of the Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, now destroyed and gone: he gave by his Testament,
a thousand pound toward the building up of that Church; and yet was not
permitted a resting place for his bones there afterwards. <HI>Richard Chawcer</HI>
Vintner, thought to be the Father of <HI>Ieffrey Chawcer</HI> the Poet, was a great Be∣nefactor
to this Church.</P>
<P>At the upper end of <HI>Hosier-lane,</HI> toward <HI>VVest-Cheape,</HI> is the fair Parish
Church of St. <HI>Mary Bow;</HI> this Church in the Reign of <HI>VVilliam the Conqueror,</HI>
being the first in this City, builded on <HI>Arches of Stone,</HI> was therefore called
<HI>New Mary Church,</HI> of <HI>St. Mary de Arcubus, orle Bow,</HI> in <HI>VVest Cheaping;</HI> As
<HI>Stratford Bridge,</HI> being the first builded (by <HI>Matilda,</HI> the Queen, VVife to <HI>Henry</HI>
the first) with <HI>Arches</HI> of Stone was called <HI>Stratfordle Bow;</HI> which names, to
the said Church and Bridge, remain till this day; the Court of the Arches is
kept in this Church, and taketh name of the place, not the place of the Court;
but of what Antiquity, or continuation that Court hath there continued, 'tis
uncertain.</P>
<P>This Church is of <HI>Cordwainer-street,</HI> and for divers accidents happening
there, hath bin made more famous than any other Parish Church of the whole
City, or Suburbs.</P>
<P>First we read, that in the year 1090, and the third of <HI>VVilliam Rufus,</HI> by
tempest of vvin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the roof of the Church of St. <HI>Mary Bow</HI> in <HI>Cheape,</HI> was over∣turned,
wherewith some persons were slain, and four of the Rafters of six and
twenty foot in length, with such violence were pitched in the ground of the
high street, that scantly four foot of them remained above ground, which were
fain to be cut even with the ground, because they could not be plucked out; for
the City of <HI>London</HI> was not then paved, but a Moorish ground.</P>
<P>In the year 1196. <HI>VVilliam Fitz Osbert,</HI> a seditious Traytor, took the <HI>Steeple
of Bow,</HI> and fortified it with Munitions and victuals, but it was assaulted,
and <HI>VVilllam</HI> with his Complices, were taken (though without blood-shed)
for he was forced by fire and smoak to forsake the Church, and then being by
the Judges condemned, he was by the heels drawn to the <HI>Elmes in Smithfield,</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="64"/>
and there hanged with nine of his fellowes, where because his favourers came
not to deliver him, he forsook <HI>Maries</HI> Son, (as he termed Christ our Saviour)
and called upon the Devil to help and deliver him: such was the end of this de∣ceiver,
a man of an evil life, a secret murtherer, a filthy fornicator, a keep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Concubines, and (amongst other his detestable facts) a false accuser of his elder
Brother, who had (in his youth) brought him up in learning, and done many
things for his preferment.</P>
<P>In the year 1271. a great part of the Church of <HI>Bow</HI> fell down, and slew ma∣ny
people, men and women.</P>
<P>In the year 1284, the thirteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Lawrence Ducket,</HI> Gold∣smith,
having grievously wounded one <HI>Ralph Crepin</HI> in <HI>West Cheap,</HI> fled into
<HI>Bow-Church,</HI> into the which (in the night time) entred certain evil persons,
friends unto the said <HI>Ralph,</HI> and slew the said <HI>Laurence,</HI> lying in the Steeple, and
then hanged him up, placing him so by the Window, as if he had hanged him∣self,
and so was it found by Inquisition; for the which fact, <HI>Lawrence Ducket</HI>
being drawn by the feet, was buried in a ditch without the City; but shortly
after (by relation of a Boy, who lay with the said <HI>Lawrence,</HI> at the time of his
death, and had hid him there for fear) the truth of the matter was disclosed;
for the which cause, <HI>Iordan Good-Cheape, Ralph Crepin, Gilbert Clarke,</HI> and <HI>Ief∣frey
Clarke,</HI> were attainted, and a certain Woman named <HI>Alice,</HI> that was chief
causer of the said mischief, was burned, and to the number of sixteen men, were
drawn and hanged, besides others that, being richer, after long imprisonment,
were hanged by the purse.</P>
<P>The Church was interdicted, the Doors and Windows were stopped up with
Thorns for a while, but <HI>Lawrence</HI> was taken up, and honestly buried in the
Church-yard afterwards.</P>
<P>The Parish-Church of St. <HI>Mary Bow,</HI> by meanes of incroachment, and buil∣ding
of Houses, wanting room in their Church-yard, for burial of the Dead,
<HI>Iohn Rotham,</HI> or <HI>Rodham,</HI> Citizen and Taylor, by his Testament dated the year
1465. gave to the Parson and Church-wardens, a certain Garden in <HI>Hosier-lane,</HI>
to be a Church-yard, which so continued near a hundred years, but now is buil∣ded
on, and is a private mans house. The old Steeple of this Church, was by
little and little re-edified, and new builded up, at the least so much as was fal∣len
down, many men giving sums of money to the furtherance thereof, so that
at length, to wit, in the year 1469, it was ordained by a Common Councel,
that the <HI>Bow Bell</HI> should be nightly rung at nine of the Clock.</P>
<P>Shortly after, <HI>Iohn Donne</HI> Mercer, by his Testament dated 1472, according
to the trust of Reginald <HI>Longdon,</HI> gave to the Parson and Church-wardens of St.
<HI>Mary Bow</HI> two Tenements, with the appurtenances, since made into one, in
<HI>Hosierlane,</HI> then so called, to the maintenance of <HI>Bow Bell,</HI> the same to be
rung as aforesaid, and other things to be observed, as by the Will ap∣peareth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arches</HI> or <HI>Bowes</HI> thereupon with the Lanthorns five in number, to wit,
one at each Corner, and one on the top in the middle upon the Arches, were
also afterward finished of Stone, brought from <HI>Cane</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> delivered at
the Customers Key, for four shillings eight pence the Tun 1515, and 1516,
<HI>William Copland</HI> being Church-warden. It is said that this <HI>Copland</HI> gave the
great Bell, which made the fifth in the Ring, to be rung nightly at nine of the
Clock: This Bell was first rung (as a Knell) at the Burial of the same <HI>Copland;</HI>
It appeareth, that the Lanthorns on the top of this Steeple, were meant to have
bin glazed, and lights in them placed nightly in the Winter, whereby Travel∣lers
to the City might have the better sight thereof, and not to misse of their
wayes.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="65"/>
In this Parish also was a Grammar-School, by commandment of King <HI>Henry</HI>
the sixth, which <HI>School</HI> was (of old time) kept in an house for that purpose pre∣pared
in the Church-yard; But that School being decayed, as others about
this City, the School-house was let out for Rent, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI>
for four shillings the year, a Cellar for two shillings the year, and two Vaults
under the Church, for 15 s. both.</P>
<P>There are Monuments of divers Citizens of note in this Church, but most
of them much defac'd, and mouldred away.</P>
<P>Without the North side of this Church of St. <HI>Mary Bow,</HI> towards <HI>West-Cheape,</HI>
standeth one fair building of Stone, called in Record <HI>Sildam,</HI> a shed
which greatly darkneth the said Church; for by meanes thereof, all the Win∣dows
and doors on that side, are stopped up; King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, upon
occasion, as shall be shewed in the Ward of <HI>Cheap,</HI> caused this side or shed to be
made, and strongly to be builded of Stone for himself, the Queen, and other
States, to stand there to behold the Justings, and other shewes at their plea∣sures;
And this House (for long time after) served to that use, namely, in the
Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Richard</HI> the second; but in the year 1410. <HI>Henry</HI>
the fourth, in the twelfth of his Reign, confirmed the said shed or building, to
<HI>Stephen Spilman, William Marchford,</HI> and <HI>John Wattle,</HI> Mercers, by the name
of one new <HI>Sildain,</HI> Shed or Building, with Shops, Cellars, and Edifices, what∣soever
appertaining, called <HI>Crounsild,</HI> or <HI>Tamersild,</HI> scituate in the
Mercety of <HI>West-Cheape,</HI> and in the Parish of St. <HI>Mary de Arcubus</HI> in
<HI>London,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding which grant, the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> and other great Estates,
as well of forraign Countries repairing to this Realm, as Inhabitants of the
same, have usually repaired to this place, therein to behold the shewes of this
City, passing through <HI>West-Cheape;</HI> namely, the great Watches accustomed in
the night, on the Even of St. <HI>John Baptist,</HI> and St. <HI>Peter</HI> at Midsommer; the
Examples whereof were over-long to recite, wherefore let it suffice briefly to
rouch one.</P>
<P>In the year 1510, on St. <HI>Johns</HI> Eve at night, King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, came
to this place, then called the <HI>Kings-Head</HI> in <HI>Cheape,</HI> in the Livery of a Yeoman
of the Gard, with an Halberd on his shoulder, and there beholding the
Watch, departed privily, when the Watch was done; and was not known to
any, but whom it pleased him; But on Saint <HI>Peters</HI> night next following, He
and the Queen came Royally riding to the said place, and there with their
Nobles, beheld the Watch of the City, and return'd in the
morning.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Sixteenth Ward, or Aldermanry of
the City of LONDON, called
Cheape-Ward.</HEAD>
<P>WE enter now into the Center of the City, which is <HI>Cheap</HI>-Ward, ta∣king
name of the Market there kept, called <HI>West Cheaping;</HI> which
<HI>Ward,</HI> as a River, as Mr. <HI>Stow</HI> saith, that hath three heads, and running
along to the uttermost of his bounds, issueth out on the sides into little streams:
so this Ward, beginning on the Course of <HI>Wallbrook,</HI> and is not the meanest
of the Wards, (if for no other cause, yet because it is nearest to the heart of
the City) hath his beginning on the East from three places. The High street of
the <HI>Poultrey,</HI> the lower end of <HI>Buckles bury,</HI> and the nether part of the <HI>Venell,</HI>
or entry into <HI>Scalding Alley,</HI> &amp; so running along, as far as unto the North-East
corner of <HI>Bow-lane</HI> on the South side, and from thence into <HI>Bow-lane</HI> on the East
side, until ye come to the Channel over against the Cellardoor under the Church;
&amp; then, on the North side of <HI>Cheap</HI> up to the Standard, stretching it self into divers
Lanes and peeces, on the right hand, and on the left hand, as it commeth along.</P>
<P>First, for the High street of the Poultrey (which is the main body of this
Ward:) on the South side thereof toward the East, this Ward beginneth in
the way going down to St. <HI>Mary Wooll-Church.</HI></P>
<P>Now for Antiquities, and things worthy of memory in <HI>Cheap</HI>-Ward.</P>
<P>First, in the main Body of this Ward, that is, the <HI>Poultry,</HI> standeth the
hansome little Church, that beareth the name of St. <HI>Mildred in the Poultry the
Virgin,</HI> which name was given surely for distinction not for superstition; for so
was the Custom of the Kingdom (&amp; yet is) in building their things for the service
of God, that the Founders called them by the name of some Apostle, Saint,
Martyr, or Confessor, as best liked their own conceit, at the present time, to di∣stinguish
them from others.</P>
<P>Who this <HI>Mildred</HI> was, whether she was the Eldest Daughter of <HI>Merwaldus,</HI>
King of the <HI>VVest-Mercians,</HI> as some think, or that she was Daughter of <HI>Ethel∣bert,</HI>
King of <HI>Kent,</HI> one of the founders of <HI>Pauls Church,</HI> it is incertain: nei∣ther
is it much material, but it is probable, that she was some holy and devout
Maid, which the People of that Age held to be a Saint afterward in
Heaven.</P>
<P>In what years this Church was first erected, or who was the first Founder of
it, we find not; but it appeareth by some ancient Evidences of the said
Church, that from the beginning it had not so much spare ground about it, as to
make a Church-yard of, until in the year of our Lord God 1420, and the <HI>8th</HI> of
King <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Thomas Morsted</HI> Esquire, and Chirurgion to the Kings,
<HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. (And afterward, in
<HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1436. was Sheriff and Alderman of <HI>London)</HI> gave unto the Church
a parcel of ground, lying between his dwelling-house and the said Church (and
adjoyning unto the said Church toward the North) to make a Church-yard of,
for the burial of their Dead, containing in length, from the Course of <HI>VVall∣brook,</HI>
toward the West, forty five foot, and in breadth, from the Church to∣ward
the North, thirty five foot.</P>
<P>Within short time after, some body, of Religious and Charitable disposition,
erected upon the sides of the said Church-yard, but upon Posts and Pillars,
with Cloysters underneath, toward the West, a Parsonage House, or Mansion,
and free dwelling of the Ministers and Rectors of the said Church, and toward
<PB N="112" REF="66"/>
the East four Chambers, then called the Priests Chambers, now converted into
a Tenement or dwelling House, &amp; demised for yearly Rent; but the Church-yard
is much abridged, and of late fouly defaced; and the lights of the said Parso∣nage
hindered by additions of pieces, to the said ancient Chambers, which
ought not to be: In this ancient Church, some Citizens of note lie
buried.</P>
<P>Some few Houses West from this Parish Church of St. <HI>Mildred,</HI> is a Prison∣house,
pertaining to one of the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> and is called the Counter in
the <HI>Poultry:</HI> This hath bin there kept, and continued time out of minde; for I
have not read of the Original thereof: West from this Counter, was a proper
Chappel, called of <HI>Corpus Christi,</HI> and St. <HI>Mary,</HI> at <HI>Cony-hope</HI> lane end, in the Pa∣rish
of the said <HI>Mildred,</HI> founded by one named <HI>Iorivirunnes,</HI> a Citizen of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; in which Chappel was a <HI>Guild,</HI> or Frater∣nity,
that might dispend in Lands better then twenty pounds by year; it was
suppressed by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and purchased by one <HI>Thomas Hobson,</HI> Haber∣dasher:
he turned this Chappel into a fair Ware-house, and Shops towards the
street, with fair Lodgings over them.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Cony-hope lane,</HI> of old time so called, of a signe of three Coneys,
which hung over a Poulterers Stall at the Lanes end; within this Lane standeth
the <HI>Grocers Hall,</HI> which Company being of old time called <HI>Pepperers,</HI> were first
incorporated by the name of <HI>Grocers,</HI> in the year 1345, at which time, they e∣lected
for Cus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os, or Gardian of their Fraternity, <HI>Richard Oswin,</HI> and <HI>Lawrence
Hallwell,</HI> and twenty Brethren were then taken in, to be of their Society.</P>
<P>In the year 1411, the Custos or Gardian, and the Brethren of this Company,
purchased of the Lord <HI>Robert Fitzwaters,</HI> one Plot of ground, with the buil∣ding
thereupon, in the said <HI>Cony-hope lane,</HI> for three hundred twenty Marks,
and then laid their foundation of their new Common-Hall.</P>
<P>About the year 1429, the <HI>Grocers</HI> had Licence to purchase five hundred
Marks Land; since the which time, near adjoyning unto the <HI>Grocers Hall,</HI> the
said Company have builded seven proper Houses, for seven aged poor, Alms∣people;
<HI>Thomas Knowles</HI> Grocer and Maior, gave his Tenement in St. <HI>Antho∣nies</HI>
Church-yard to the <HI>Grocers,</HI> towards the relief of the poor Brethren in that
Company: Also <HI>Henry Keeble,</HI> Grocer and Maior, gave to the seven Alms∣people,
six pence weekly for ever; which Pension is now increased by the Ma∣sters,
to some of them two shillings a peece weekly, and to some of them lesse,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Henry Ady</HI> Grocer, 1563, gave a thousand Marks to the <HI>Grocers</HI> to purchase
Lands, and Sir <HI>Henry Pechy,</HI> Knight Banneret, free of that Company, gave them
five hundred pounds to certain uses: he builded Alms-houses at <HI>Luding stone</HI> in
<HI>Kent,</HI> and was there buried.</P>
<P>West from this <HI>Cony-hope</HI> Lane, is the <HI>Old Iury,</HI> whereof some portion is of
<HI>Cheape Ward;</HI> at the South end of this Lane, is the Parish-Church of St. <HI>Mary
Cole-Church,</HI> named of one <HI>Cole,</HI> that builded it: this Church is builded upon
a Vault above ground, so that men are forced to go to ascend up thereunto, by
certain steps, I finde no Monuments of this Church more, than that <HI>Henry</HI> the
fourth granted Licence to <HI>William Marshal,</HI> and others, to found a Brother∣hood
of Saint <HI>Katherine</HI> therein, because <HI>Thomas Becket</HI> and St. <HI>Edmond,</HI> the
Arch Bishop were baptized there.</P>
<P>The <HI>Old Iury</HI> hath had alwayes Citizens of quality, and fair large Houses, as
there is now <HI>Gurney-house,</HI> where Alderman <HI>Friderique</HI> lives, a very worthy
Gentleman.</P>
<P>There is also another ancient fair House of <HI>Thomas Bowyer,</HI> and another of
Mr. <HI>Bonnel,</HI> worthy and wealthy brave Marchants.</P>
<P>We read of <HI>Bordhangli-lane,</HI> to be of that Parish; and thus much for the
North side of the <HI>Poultry.</HI> The South side of the said <HI>Poultry,</HI> beginning on the
<PB N="113" REF="66"/>
Bank of the said Brook, over against the Parish-Church of St. <HI>Mildred</HI> passing,
up to the great Conduit, hath divers fair Houses, which were sometimes inha∣bited
by the <HI>Poulterers,</HI> but now by <HI>Grocers, Haberdashers,</HI> and <HI>Upholsters.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning other Antiquities there, first is <HI>Bucklesbury,</HI> so called of a Man∣nor,
and Tenements pertaining to one <HI>Buckle</HI> who there dwelled, and kept his
Courts; this Mannor is supposed to be the great Stone-Building. yet in part
remaining on the South side of the street, which of late time hath been called
the <HI>Old Barge,</HI> of such a signe hanged out, near the Garte thereof; This Mannor,
or great House, hath of long time bin divided, and letten out into m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny Tene∣ments;
and it hath bin a common Speech, that when <HI>Wallbrook</HI> did lie open,
Barges were rowed out of the Thames, or towed up so far; and therefore the
place hath ever since bin called the <HI>Old Barge.</HI></P>
<P>Also, on the North side of this street, directly over against the said <HI>Buckles∣bury,</HI>
was one ancient and strong Tower of Stone; the which Tower, King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the third, in the eighteenth of his Reign, called by the name of the
<HI>Kings</HI> house, and <HI>Cornet Stoure</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id appoint his <HI>Exchange of mo∣ney,</HI>
there to be kept: In the nine and twentieth, he granted it to <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idus Guy∣nysane,</HI>
and <HI>Landus Bardaile,</HI> Marchants of <HI>Luke,</HI> for twenty pound the year;
And in the three and twentieth, he gave the same Tower to his <HI>Colledge,</HI> or
Free Chappel of St. <HI>Stephen</HI> at <HI>VVestmister,</HI> by the name of <HI>Cornet Stoure,</HI> at
<HI>Bucklesbury</HI> in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This whole street, called <HI>Buckles bury,</HI> on both the sides throughout, is pos∣sessed
of <HI>Grocers,</HI> and <HI>Apothecaries;</HI> toward the West end thereof, on the South
side, breaketh out one other short lane, called in Records, <HI>Peneritch-street,</HI> it
reacheth but to St. <HI>Sythes</HI> lane; and St. <HI>Sythes</HI> Church, is the farthest part there∣of;
for by the West end of the said Church, beginneth <HI>Needles</HI> Lane, which
reacheth to <HI>Sopers</HI> Lane, as is aforesaid.</P>
<P>This small Parish Church of St. <HI>Syth,</HI> hath also an addition of <HI>Bennet Shorne,</HI>
(or <HI>Shrog,</HI> or <HI>Shorehog)</HI> for by all these names it hath bin called; but the anci∣ent
is <HI>Shorne,</HI> wherefore it seemeth to take that name of one <HI>Benedict Shorne,</HI>
sometime a Citizen and <HI>Stock-fishmonger</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> a new Builder, repairer, or
Benefactor thereof, in the year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, so that <HI>Shorne</HI> is but cor∣ruptly
called <HI>Shrog,</HI> and more corruptly <HI>Shorehog,</HI> Here are divers Monu∣ments,
and among other the Tomb of Sir <HI>Raph V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arren,</HI> Knight, Alderman,
twice Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> and Marchant of the Staple at <HI>Callis,</HI> with his two
Wives, <HI>Anno</HI> 1553.</P>
<P>Then in <HI>Needlers</HI> Lane, have ye the Parish Church of St. <HI>Pancrase,</HI> a proper
small Church, but divers rich Parishioners therein, and hath had of old time,
many liberal Benefactors; But of late, such as (not regarding the Order ta∣ken
by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,)</HI> the least Bell in their Church being broken, have ra∣ther
sold the same for half the value, then put the Parish to charge with new
casting: late experience hath proved this to be true, besides the spoil of Monu∣ments
there; This little Church hath also some handsome Monu∣ments.</P>
<P>Then is a part of <HI>Sopers-lane,</HI> turning up to <HI>Cheap.</HI></P>
<P>By the assent of <HI>Stephen Abunden,</HI> Maior, the <HI>Pepperers</HI> in <HI>Sopers</HI> lane, were
admitted sell all such Spices, and other Wares, as <HI>Grocers</HI> now use to sell, re∣taining
the old name of <HI>Pepperers</HI> in <HI>Sopers</HI> lane, till at length, in the Reign of
<HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, the same <HI>Sopers</HI> lane was inhabited by <HI>Cordwayners</HI> and <HI>Curriers,</HI>
after that the <HI>Pepperers</HI> or <HI>Grocers</HI> had seated themselves in a more open street,
to wit, in <HI>Buckles bury,</HI> where they now remain: Thus much for the South
Wing of <HI>Cheap-Ward.</HI></P>
<P>At the West end of this <HI>Poultry,</HI> and also of <HI>Bucklers bury,</HI> beginneth the
large street of West <HI>Cheaping,</HI> a Market place so called, which street siretcheth
West, till ye come to the little Conduit by <HI>Pauls</HI> Gate, but not all of <HI>Cheap</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="67"/>
Ward. In the East part of this street standeth the Great Conduit, of Sweet∣water,

of this City, castellated with stone, and Cisterned in Lead, about the year
1285, and again new builded and enlarged by <HI>Thomas Ilam</HI> one of the Sheriffs,
1479.</P>
<P>About the middest of this street is the <HI>Standard</HI> in <HI>Cheape:</HI> of what Anti∣quity,
the first foundation is, I have not read. But <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth by his Patent,
dated at <HI>Windsor</HI> the one and twentieth of his Reign (which Patent, was con∣firmed
by Parliament, 1442) granted Licence to <HI>Thomas Knolles, Iohn Chichle,</HI>
and other Executers to <HI>Iohn Wells,</HI> Grocer, sometime Maior of <HI>London,</HI> with his
Goods to make new the high-way, which leadeth from the City of <HI>London,</HI> to∣wards
the place of <HI>Westminster,</HI> before and nigh the Mannor of <HI>Savoy,</HI> parcel of

in that way, within the length of five hundred foot, and all the breadth of the
same. before and nigh the fire of the Manner aforesaid, they were to break up,
and with Stone, Gravel, and other stuffe, make one other good and sufficient
way for the Commodity of the Subjects; And further, that the <HI>Standard</HI> in
<HI>Cheape,</HI> where divers Executions of the Law before time had bin performed;
which Standard at that pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent was very ruinous with age; in which there was a
Cond it, should be taken down, and another competent Standard of Stone; to∣gether
with a Conduit in the same, of new, strongly to be builded, for the
Commodity and honour of the City, with the goods of their Testator, without
interruption <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Of Executions at the Standard in <HI>Cheape,</HI> we read, that in the year 1293.
three men had their right hands smitten off there, for rescuing of a Prisoner, ar∣rested
by an Officer of the City.</P>
<P>In the year 1326, the Burgesses of <HI>London,</HI> caused <HI>Walter Stapleton,</HI> Bishop of
<HI>Exceter,</HI> Treasurer to <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and others, to be beheaded at the
Standard in <HI>Cheap</HI> (but this was by <HI>Pauls</HI> Gate.)</P>
<P>In the year 1351, the six and twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, two Fishmon∣gers
were beheaded at the Standard in <HI>Cheap. 1381, wat Tylar</HI> beheaded, <HI>Rich∣ard
Lyons,</HI> and others, there.</P>
<P>In the year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>99, <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, caused the Blank Charters, made by <HI>Rich∣ard</HI>
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>econd, to be burnt there.</P>
<P>In the year 1450, <HI>Iack Cade,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Rebels, beheaded the
Lord <HI>Say</HI> there.</P>
<P>In the year 1461, <HI>Iohn Davy</HI> had his hand stricken off there, because he had
stricken a man before the Judges at <HI>Westminster,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then next is the great Crosse in <HI>VVest Cheap,</HI> which Crosse was there erected
in the year 1290, by <HI>Edward</HI> the first; upon occasion thus, Queen <HI>Elianor</HI> his
Wise, dyed at <HI>Hardeby</HI> (a Town near unto the City of <HI>Lincoln)</HI> her Body was
brought from thence to <HI>VVestminster,</HI> and the King in memory of her, caused in
every place, where her Body rested by the way, a stately Crosse of Stone to be e∣recte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
with the Queens Image, and Arms upon it, as at <HI>Grantham, VVoborn,
Northampton, Stony-stratford Dunstable,</HI> St. <HI>Albones, VValtham, VVest-Cheape,</HI>
and at <HI>Charing,</HI> from whence she was conveyed to <HI>VVestminster,</HI> and there bu∣ried.</P>
<P>This Crosse in <HI>VVest-Cheape,</HI> being like to those other which remain to this
day; and being by length of time decayed, <HI>Iohn Hatherley,</HI> Mayor of <HI>London,</HI>
procured in the year 1441, Licence of King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, to re-edifie the
same in more beautiful manner, for the honour of the City; and had Licence
also, to take up two hundred Fodder of Lead, for the building thereof, &amp; of cer∣tain
Conduits, and a common Granary. This Crosse was then curiously
wrought, at the Charges of divers Citizens; <HI>Iohn Fisher</HI> Mercer, gave six hun∣dred
<PB N="115" REF="67"/>
Marks towards it, the same was begun to be set up 1484, and finished 1486,
the second of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh: It was, after, gilt over, in the
year 1522, against the comming in of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, Emperor. In
the year 1553, against the Coronation of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> New burnished against
the Coronation of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth; And again new guilt 1554, against the
comming in of King <HI>Philip.</HI> Since which time, the said Crosse having bin pre∣sented
by divers Juries, (or Quests of <HI>Wardmote)</HI> to stand in the high-way, to
the let of carriages (as they alledged) but could not have it removed; it fol∣lowed,
that in the year 1581, the twenty one of <HI>Iune,</HI> in the night, the lowest
Images round about the said Crosse (being of Christ his Resurrection, of the
<HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and such like) were broken, and de∣faced:
Proclamation was made, that who so would discover the doers, should
have forty Crowns, but nothing came to light: the Image of the blessed Vir∣gin,
at that time was robbed of her Son, and her Arms broken, by which she
stayed him on her knees; her whole body was also haled with Ropes, and left
likely to fall; but in the year 1595. was again fastened and repaired; and in
the year next following, a new mis-shapen Son, as born out of time, all naked,
was laid in her Arms; the other Images remaining, broke as afore. But on the
East side of the same Crosse, the steps being taken thence; under the Image of
Christs Resurrection defaced, was set up a curious wrought Tabernacle of gray
Marble, and in the same an Alabaster Image of <HI>Diana,</HI> and water conveyed from
the Thames, prilling from her naked Brest for a time, but now de∣cayed.</P>
<P>In the year 1599, the Timber of the Crosse at the top, being rotted within
the Lead, the Arms thereof bending, were feared to have fallen, to the harming
of some people; and therefore the whole Body of the Crosse, was seasfolded
about, and the top thereof taken down, meaning in place thereof, to have set
up a <HI>Pyramis:</HI> but some of her Majesties honourable Councellors, directed their
Letters to Sir <HI>Nicholas Mosley,</HI> then Maior, by her Highnesse express Com∣mandment
concerning the Crosse, forthwith to be repaired, and placed again
as it formerly stood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Notwithstanding, the said Crosse stood he adless more
then a year after, whereupon the said Councellors in great number, meaning
not any longer to permit the continuance of such a contempt, wrote to <HI>Wil∣liam
Rider,</HI> then Maior, requiring him, by vertue of her Highness said former
direction and Commandement, without any further delay, to accomplish her
Majesties most princely care therein, respecting especially, the Antiquity and
continuance of that Monument, and ancient Ensign of Christianity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> dared
the four and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> 1600. After this, a Crosse of Timber was
framed, set up, covered with Lead, and gilded, the Body of the Crosse down∣ward,
cleansed of dust, the Scaffold cartyed thence. About twelve nights fol∣lowing,
the Image of our Lady was again defaced, by plucking off her Crown,
and almost her head, taking from her, her naked Child, and stabbing her in the
Brest.</P>
<P>But in the year 1644, during the Reign of the long Parliament, the said
Crosse, by an Ordinance thereof, was utterly demolished; and while the thing
was a doing, there was a noyse of Trumpets blew all the while. Upon the utter
demolition of this so ancient and visible a Monument, or Ornament of the
City of <HI>London</HI> as all Forrainers esteemed it, it fortuned, that there was another
new one, popp'd up in <HI>Cheap-side,</HI> hard by the Standard, <HI>viz.</HI> a high square Ta∣ble
of Stone, left in Legacy by one <HI>Russel</HI> a Porter, and well-minded man, with
this Distichengraven,
<Q><L>God blesse the Porter who great pains doth take,</L>
<L>Rest here, and welcome when thy back doth ake.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus much for the <HI>Crosse</HI> in <HI>West-cheape.</HI> Then at the West end of <HI>West-Cheap-street,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="68"/>
was sometimes a Crosse of Stone called the <HI>Old Crosse. Ralph
Higden</HI> in his <HI>Polychronicon</HI> saith, that <HI>Walter Stapleton</HI> Bishop of Exceter, Trea∣surer
to <HI>Edward</HI> the second, was by the Burgesses of <HI>London</HI> beheaded at this
Crosse, then called the Standard, without the North door of St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church;
and so it is noted in other Writers that then lived. This old Crosse stood and
remained at the East end of the Parish Church called St. <HI>Michael</HI> in the corner
by <HI>Pauls</HI> Gate, near to the North end of the old Exchange, till the year 1390,
the thirteenth of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, in place of which old Crosse then taken
down, the said Church of St. <HI>Michael</HI> was enlarged, and also a fair Water-Con∣duit
builded, about the ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, divers Justings were made in this street,
betwixt <HI>Sopers</HI> Lane and the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Crosse, namely, one in the year 1331, about
the one and twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> as 'tis obserted by divers Writers of that
time. In the middle of the City of <HI>London,</HI> (say they) in a Street called <HI>Cheap,</HI>
the Stone pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ement, being covered with sand, that the Horses might not slide,
when they strongly set their feet to the ground, the King held a Tournement
three daies together with the Nobility, valiant men of the Realm, and others,
some strange Knights; And to the end the beholders might with the better ease
see the same, there was a wooden Scaffold erected crosse the street, like unto a
Tower, wherein Queen <HI>Philip</HI> and many other Ladies, richly attired, and
assembled from all parts of the Realm, did stand to behold the Justs, but the
higher frame in which the Ladies were placed, brake in sunder, whereby they
were (with some shame) forced to fall down, by reason whereof the Knights,
and such as were underneath, were grievously hurt; wherefore the Queen took
great care to save the Carpenters from punishment, and through her prayers
(which she made upon her Knee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) pacified the King and Councel, and thereby
purchased great love of the people. After which time, the King caused a shed to
be strongly made of Stone for himself, the Queen, and other States to stand on,
and there to behold the Justings, and other shewes, at their pleasure, by the
Church of St. <HI>Mary Bow,</HI> as is shewed in <HI>Cordwayner-street</HI> Ward. Thus much
for the High street of <HI>Cheap.</HI></P>
<P>Now of the North side of Cheap street and Ward, beginning at the great
Conduit, and by St. <HI>Mary Cole Church,</HI> where we left; Next thereunto West∣ward,
is the <HI>Mercers Chappel,</HI> sometime an Hospital, entituled of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of
<HI>Acon,</HI> or <HI>Acars,</HI> for a Master and Brethren. <HI>Militia Hospitalis &amp;c,</HI> saith the Re∣cord
of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the fourteenth year, it was founded by <HI>Thomas Fitz
Theobald de Heili,</HI> and <HI>Agnes</HI> his Wife, sister to <HI>Thomas Becket,</HI> in the Reign of
<HI>Henry</HI> the second: they gave to the Master and Brethren the Lands with the ap∣purtenances,
that sometimes were <HI>Gilbert Beckets,</HI> Father to the said <HI>Thomas,</HI> in
the which he was born, there to make a Church; There was a Charnel, and a
Chappel over it of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> and St. <HI>Stephen;</HI> This Hospital was valued to
dispend two hundred seventy seven pounds, three shillings four pence,
surrendred the thirtieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, the one and twentieth of <HI>October,</HI>
and was since purchased by the <HI>Mercers,</HI> by means of Sir <HI>Richard Gresham,</HI> and
was again set open on the Eve of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> 1541, the three and thirtieth
of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; It is now called the <HI>Mercers Chappel,</HI> therein is kept a
free Grammer School, as of old time had been accustomed, commanded by
Parliament.</P>
<P>In this Chappel there is every Sunday morning throughout the year a Sermon
in the <HI>Italian</HI> Tongue, beginning about ten a clock.</P>
<P>Here be many Monuments remaining, but more have been defaced; among
others, there is <HI>Iames Butler</HI> Earl of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and Dame <HI>Ioane</HI> his Countesse,
1428.</P>
<P>Before this Hospital towards the street, was builded a fair and beautiful Chap∣pel
arched over with stone, and thereupon the Mercers Hall, a most curious
<PB N="117" REF="68"/>
piece of work, Sir <HI>Iohn Allen</HI> Mercer, being founder of that Chappel, was there
buried, but since his Tombe is removed thence into the Body of the Hospital:
Church, and his Body-room divided into Shops, are letten our for Rent; These
Mercers were enabled to be a Company, and to purchase Lands to the value of
twenty pound the year, the seventeenth of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chard</HI> the second; they had three
Messuages and Shops in the Parish of Saint <HI>Martins Otesw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch,</HI> in the Ward of
<HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> for the sustentation of the poor, and a Chantry, the two and twen∣tieth
of <HI>Richard</HI> the second. <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth in the twelfth of his Reign, con∣firmed
to <HI>Stephen Spilman, W. Marchford</HI> and <HI>Iohn Watild</HI> Mercers, by the name
of one new <HI>Sildam,</HI> shed, or building, with Shops, Cellars, and Edifices what∣soever
appertaining, called <HI>Crownsildes</HI> Scituate in the <HI>Mercery</HI> in West-cheap,
in the Parish of St. <HI>Mary de Arcubus</HI> in <HI>London, &amp;c.</HI> to be holden in <HI>Burgage,</HI>
as all the City of <HI>London</HI> is.</P>
<P>Next beyond the <HI>Mercers Chappel,</HI> and their Hall, is <HI>Ironmonger</HI> Lane, so cal∣led
of <HI>Ironmongers</HI> dwelling there.</P>
<P>In this Lane, is the small Parish Church of St. <HI>Martin,</HI> called <HI>Pomary,</HI> upon
what occasion I certainly know not; it is supposed to be of <HI>Apples</HI> growing,
where now Houses are lately builded.</P>
<P>Farther West, is St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> Lane, so called of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> Church, which
standeth directly over against the North end thereof. Antiquities in this Lane
I finde none other, then that among many fair Houses, there is one large Inne
for receipt of travellers, called <HI>Blossomes Inne,</HI> but corruptly <HI>Bosomes
Inne,</HI> and hath to Sign St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> the Deacon, in a Border of <HI>Blossoms</HI> or
Flowers.</P>
<P>Then near to the standard in Cheap, is <HI>Hony-lane,</HI> being very narrow, and
somewhat dark.</P>
<P>In this Lane, is the small Parish Church called <HI>Alhallowes in Hony-Lane;</HI>
There be no Monuments in this Church worth the noting. I find that <HI>Iohn
Norman,</HI> Draper, Mayor 1453, was buried there. He gave to the Drapers his
Tenements on the North side the said Church; they to allow for the Beam
light and Lamp, thirteen shillings four pence yearly, from this Lane to the
Standard. And thus much for Cheap Ward, in the High-street of Cheap, for it
stretcheth no farther.</P>
<P>Now, for the North wing of <HI>Cheap</HI> Ward, have ye <HI>Catte-street,</HI> corruptly
called <HI>Catteaten</HI>-street, which beginneth at the North end of <HI>Ironmong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
Lane, and runneth to the West end of Saint <HI>Lawrence-Church,</HI> as is afore∣shewed.</P>
<P>On the North side of this street is the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> wherein the Courts for the
City are kept, namely, first the Court of <HI>Common-Councel,</HI> second the Court of
the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI> and his Brethren the Aldermen, third the Court of <HI>Hustings,</HI>
fourth the Court of <HI>Orphanes,</HI> fifth the two <HI>Courts of the Sheriffs</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixt the Court of
the <HI>Wardmote,</HI> seventh the Court of <HI>Hallmote,</HI> eight the Court of <HI>Requests,</HI> com∣monly
called <HI>the Court of Conscience,</HI> nine the <HI>Chamberlains Court</HI> for Prentices,
&amp; making them free; This <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> saith <HI>Robert Fabian,</HI> was began to be builded
new, in the year 1411, the twelfth of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, by <HI>Thomas Knowles,</HI>
then Mayor, and his Brethren the Aldermen; The same was made, of a little
Cottage, a large and great House, as now it standeth towards the charges where∣of,
the Companies gave large benevolences; Also offences of men were pardo∣ned
for sums of money towards this work, extraordinary Fees were raised, Fines,
Amercements, and other things imployed, during seven years, with a Continu∣ation
thereof, three years more, all to be employed to this building.</P>
<P>The first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>John Coventry</HI> &amp; <HI>John Carpenter</HI> Executors to
<HI>Richard Whittington,</HI> gave towards the paving of this great Hall twenty pounds
and the next year fifteen pounds more to the said pavement, with hard Stone of
<HI>Purb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck;</HI> They also glaz'd some VVindows thereof, and of the Mayors Court,
<PB N="118" REF="69"/>
on every which Window, the Arms of <HI>Richard Whittington</HI> are placed. The foun∣dation
of the Mayors Court was laid in the third year of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the
sixth, and of the Porch on the South side of the Mayors Court, in the fourth of
the said King. Then was builded the Mayors Chamber, and the Councel
Chamber, with other Roomes above the staires.</P>
<P>Having here so just occasion, speaking of that former ancient Councel Cham∣ber,
which hath continued so ever since, I cannot but account it expedient (as
in no place better fitting) to remember the fair and goodly new Councel Cham∣ber,
a worthy Act, and an Honour to the City. The said new Councel Cham∣ber,
with a fair Room over the same, appointed for a Treasury, wherein to pre∣serve
the Books and Records belonging to the City, and another Room also un∣derneath
the same Chamber, reserved for necessary use and employment, began
to be builded the first week after Easter, in the time of the Majoralty of Sir <HI>Tho∣mas
Middleton,</HI> Knight, and Alderman, in the year of our Lord 1614, it was
fully finished shortly after <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1615, at the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter end of the Majoralty
of Sir <HI>Thomas Hayes,</HI> Knight and Alderman; But the Lord Mayor, and the Al∣dermen
his Brethren, kept their first Court in the said new Councel Chamber,
on the seventh day of <HI>November,</HI> in the year of our Lord 1615, Sir <HI>Iohn Iolles</HI>
Knight and Alderman, being then Lord Mayor; by whose order and direction,
the said building was performed, from the first beginning thereof, to the finall
finishing of the same, amounting to the charge of 1740 <HI>l.</HI> than which, no mo∣ney
could be better bestowed, nor more to the Cities credit and renown.</P>
<P>Last of all, a stately Porch en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring the great Hall, was erected; the front there∣of
towards the Stouth, being beautified with Images of Srone.</P>
<P>Now for the Chappel or Colledge of our Lady <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> and of <HI>All
Saints</HI> by <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> called <HI>London Colledge,</HI> we read, that the same was buil∣ded
about the year 1299, and that <HI>Peter Fanelore, Adam Francis,</HI> and <HI>Henry
Frowick</HI> Citizen, gave one Messuage with the appurtenances, in the Parish of
St. <HI>Foster,</HI> to <HI>William Brampton</HI> Custos of the Chauntry, by them founded in the
said Chappel, with four Chaplains; and one other House in the Parish of St.
<HI>Giles</HI> without <HI>Creplegate,</HI> in the seven and twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was
given to them.</P>
<P>Adjoyning to this Chappel on the South side, was sometime a fair and large
Library, furnished with Books pertaining to the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> and Colledge.</P>
<P>These Books (as it is said) were in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, sent for by
<HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> Lord Protector, with promise to be restored short∣ly;
Men laded from thence threescore Carts with them, but they were never
returned; This Library was builded by the Executors of <HI>R. Whittington,</HI> and
by <HI>W. Bury;</HI> on the other side, it is now lofted through, and made a Store-house
for Cloaths,</P>
<P>South-west from this <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> is the fair Parish Church of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI>
called, in the <HI>Iury,</HI> because (of old time) many Jewes inhabited there about;
This Church is fair and large, and hath divers Monuments.</P>
<P>In this Church there was the Shank-bone of a man, and also a Tooth of a ve∣ry
great bigness, hanged up for shew, in Chains of Iron, upon a Pillar of Stone:
the Tooth (being about the bigness of a mans fist) is long since conveyed from
thence; the Thigh or Shank-bone, of five and twenty inches in length by the
Rule, remaineth yet fastned to a post of Timber, and is not so much to be noted
for the length, as for the thickness, hardness, and strength thereof; for when it
was hanged on the Stone Pillar, it fretted (with moving) the said Pillar, and
was not it self fretted, nor (as seemeth) is not yet lightned by remaining dry:
but where or when this Bone was first found or discovered, I have not heard.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Seventeenth Ward, or Aldermanry
of the City of London, called Coleman∣street
Ward.</HEAD>
<P>VVE will now stear our course Northward, and look towards
<HI>London</HI> Walls to find out another Ward, and next
to <HI>Cheap Ward</HI> on the North side thereof, is <HI>Coleman-street</HI>
Ward, and beginneth also in the East, on the course
of <HI>Wallbrook,</HI> in <HI>Lothbury,</HI> and runneth West, (on the South side to the end of
<HI>Ironmongers</HI> Lane, and on the North side, to the West corner of <HI>Basing-Hall</HI>
street; On the South side of <HI>Lothbury,</HI> is the street called the <HI>Old Iewry;</HI> the one
half, and better, on both sides towards <HI>Cheap,</HI> is of this Ward.</P>
<P>Antiquities therein to be noted, are these, First, the street of <HI>Lothbury,
Lathbery,</HI> or <HI>Loadbay;</HI> This street is possessed (for the most part) by Founders,
that cast Candlesticks, Chasing-dishes, Spice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Mortars, and such like Copper or
Latin workes, and do after turn them with the Foot, and not with the Wheel,
to make them smoth and bright, with turning and scrating, (as some do term
it) making a loathsome noise to the by-passers, that have not been used to the
like, and therefore by them disdainedly called <HI>Lothbury.</HI> On the South side of
this street amongst the Founders be some fair Houses and large, for Merchants;
namely, one that of old time was the Jews <HI>Synagogue,</HI> which was defaced by
the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> after that they had slain seven hundred Jewes, and spoi∣led
the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>due of their goods, in the year 1262, the forty seventh of <HI>Henry</HI> the
third. And not long after, in the year 1291, King <HI>Edward</HI> the first banished
the remnant of the Jewes out of <HI>England,</HI> as is afore shewed.</P>
<P>The Synagogue being so suppressed, certain Fryars got possession thereof;
For in the year 1257, (saith <HI>Matthew Paris)</HI> there were seen in <HI>London</HI> a new
Order of Fryars, called <HI>De poenitentia Iesu,</HI> or <HI>Fratres de sacco,</HI> because they were
apparrelled in sackcloth, who had their House in <HI>London,</HI> near unto <HI>Aldersgate,</HI>
without the gate, and had Licence of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the four and twentieth
of his Reign, to remove from thence to any other place; and in the fifty sixt, she
gave unto them this <HI>Iews Synagogue.</HI> After which time <HI>Elianor</HI> the Queen, wife
to <HI>Edward</HI> the first, took into her protection, and warranted unto the Prior and
Brethren <HI>De poenitentia Jesu Christi,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> the said Land and building in
<HI>Cole-Church</HI> street, in the Parish of Saint <HI>Olave</HI> in the Jury and St. <HI>Margaret</HI> in
<HI>Loathbury,</HI> by her granted, with consent of <HI>Stephen de Fulborn,</HI> under-Warden
of the Bridge-house, and other Brethren of that House, for threescore Marks of
Silver, which they had received of the said Prior and Brethren of repentance,
towards the building of the said Bridge. This Order of Friers gathered many
good Schollars, and multiplyed in number exceedingly, untill the Councel,
of <HI>Lyons;</HI> by the which it was Decreed, that (from that time forth) there
should no more Orders of Begging Fryers, be permitted, but only the four
Orders, to wit, the <HI>Dominick</HI> or Preachers, the <HI>Minorites</HI> or <HI>Gray Fryers,</HI> and
the <HI>Augustines:</HI> and so from that time the Begging Fryers decreased and fell to
nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="70"/>
Now it fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowed, that in the year 1305, <HI>Robert Fitzwalter,</HI> requested and
obtained of the said King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, that the same Fryers of the <HI>Sack,</HI>

The said <HI>Robert Large,</HI> gave liberally to both these Parishes, but was buried at

<P>Hugh <HI>Clopton,</HI> Mercet, Maior 1492, dwelled in this House, and kept his Ma∣joralty

<P>And thus much for this House, sometimes the <HI>Iews</HI> Synagogue, since an house
of Fryers, then a Noble mans House, after that, a Marchants House, wherein
Majoralities have bin kept, and now a Wine-Tavern.</P>
<P>Then is the <HI>Old Jewry,</HI> a street so called of <HI>Jews,</HI> sometime dwelling there,
and near adjoyning in the Parishes of St. <HI>Olave,</HI> St. <HI>Michael Basing Hall,</HI> St.
<HI>Martin Ironmonger-lane,</HI> St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> called the <HI>Jewry,</HI> and so West to <HI>Wood-street.
William</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> first brought them from <HI>Roane</HI> to inhabit
here.</P>
<P><HI>William Rusus</HI> favoured them so far, that he sware by <HI>Lukes face,</HI> his com∣mon
Oath, if they could overcome the Christians, he would be one of their
Sect.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the second, grievously punished them for corrupting his Coyne.
<HI>Richard</HI> the first forbad Jewes, and Women to be present at his Coronation, for
fear of Inchantments; for breaking of which Commandment, many Jews were
slain, who being ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbled, to present the King with some gift, one of them
was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icken by a Christian, which some unruly people perceiving, fell upon
them, beat them to their houses, and brent them therein, or slew them at their
comming out.</P>
<P>Also the Jewes at <HI>Norwich,</HI> St. <HI>Edmonds bury, Lincoln, Stanford,</HI> and <HI>Lyn,</HI>
were robbed and spoyled; and at <HI>York,</HI> to the number of five hundred, besides
Women and Children, entred a Tower of the Castle, profered money to be in
surety of their lives; but the Christians would not take it; whereupon, they
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t the throats of their own Wives and Children, and cast them over the Walls
on the Christian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heads; and then, entring the Kings Lodging, they burned
both the House and themselves.</P>
<P>King <HI>John</HI> in the <HI>11th</HI> of his Reign, commanded all the Jews, both Men and
Women, to be imprisoned, and grievously punished, because he would have
all their Money; some of them gave all they had, and promised more, to es∣cape
so many kinds of torments; for every one of them, had one of their eyes
at the least plucked o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Amongst whom there was one, which being tormen∣ted
many wayes, would not ransome himself, till the King had caused (every
day) one of his great teeth to be plucked out, by the space of seven dayes, and
then he gave the King ten thousand Marks of silver; to the end, they should
pull out no more, the said King at that time, spoyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Jews of sixty six thou∣sand
Marks.</P>
<P>The <HI>17th</HI> of this King, the Barons brake into the Jews Houses, rifled their
Coffers, and with the Stone of their Houses, repaired the Gates and Walls of
<HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the <HI>11th</HI> of his Reign, granted to <HI>Semaine,</HI> or
<HI>Ballaster,</HI> the house of <HI>Benomie Mittun</HI> the Jew, in the Parish of St. <HI>Michael
Bassing-hanghe,</HI> in which the said <HI>Benomy</HI> dwelt, with the fourth part of all his

Land in that Parish, which <HI>VVilliam Elie</HI> held of the Fee of <HI>Hugh Nevel,</HI> and
all the Land in <HI>Colemanstreet,</HI> belonging to the said <HI>Benomy;</HI> and the fourth
part of the Land, in the Parish of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> which was the Fee of <HI>Thomas
Buckerel,</HI> and were excheted to the King, for the murther which the said <HI>Beno∣my</HI>
committed in the City of <HI>London,</HI> to hold to the said <HI>Semaine,</HI> and his
Heires, of the King, paying at Easter, a pair of gilt Spurs, and to do the servi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
thereof due unto the Lords Court.</P>
<P>In the like manner, and for like services, the King granted to <HI>Guso</HI> for his
Homage, the other part of the Lands of the said <HI>Benomye</HI> in St. <HI>Michaels</HI> Parish;
which Law, the Painter held, and was the Kings Excheter, and the Lands of the
said <HI>Benomye,</HI> in the said Parish, which <HI>VValter Turner</HI> held, and fifteen foot of
Land, which <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh Harman</HI> held, with fifteen Iron Ells of Land, and an half,
in the front of Iron-monger-lane, in the Parish of St. <HI>Martin,</HI> which were the
said <HI>Benomyes,</HI> of the Fee of the Hospital of St. <HI>Giles,</HI> and which <HI>Adam</HI> the Smith
held, with two Stone-Houses, which were <HI>Moses</HI> the Jew of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the
Parish of St. <HI>Olave;</HI> and which are of the Fee of <HI>Arnold de Reus,</HI> and are the
Kings Exchetes, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>The <HI>16th</HI> of the said <HI>Henry,</HI> the Jews in <HI>London,</HI> builded a Synagogue, but
the King commanded, it should be dedicated to our blessed Lady, and after
gave it to the Brethren of St. <HI>Anthonies of Vienna,</HI> and so was it called St. <HI>An∣thonies
Hospital.</HI></P>
<P>This King <HI>Henry</HI> founded a Church and House for converted Jews, in a new
street by the Temple, whereby it came to passe, that (in short time) there was
gathered a great number of Converts.</P>
<P>The twentieth of this King <HI>Henry,</HI> seven Jews were brought from <HI>Norwich,</HI>
vvhich had stolen a christened Child, had circumcised, and minded to have cru∣ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed
him at <HI>Easter,</HI> vvherefore their Bodies and Goods vvere at the Kings plea∣sure:
The six and twentieth, the Jews vvere constrained to pay to the King,
twenty thousand Marks, at two Termes in the year, or else to be kept in per∣petual
Prison.</P>
<P>The five and thirtieth, He taketh inestimable sums of money, of all rich men,
namely, of <HI>Aaron,</HI> a Jew born at <HI>York,</HI> fourteen thousand Marks for himself,
and ten thousand Marks for the Queen; and before, he had taken of the same
Jew as much, as in all, amounted to thirty thousand Marks of Silver, and two
hund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red Marks of Gold to the Queen.</P>
<P>In the fortieth year, vvere brought up to <HI>VVestminster,</HI> two hundred Jews
from <HI>Lincoln,</HI> for crucifying a Child, named <HI>Hugh;</HI> eighteen of them were hang'd.</P>
<P>The forty third, a Jew at <HI>Tewksbury</HI> fell into a Privie on the Saturday, and
would not that day be taken out, for reverence of his Sabbath; wherefore
<HI>Richard Clare,</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> kept him there till <HI>Monday,</HI> that he was
dead.</P>
<P>The forty seven, the Barons slew of the Jews at <HI>London,</HI> seven hundred; the
rest were spoiled, and thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Synagogue defaced, because one Jew would have
forced a Christian to have payd more than two shillings, for the lone of twenty
shillings a week.</P>
<P>The third of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in a Parliament at <HI>London,</HI> usury was forbidden
to the Jews; and that all Usurers might be known, the King commanded that
every Usurer should weare a Table on his brest, the breadth of a Paveline, or
else to avoid the Realm.</P>
<P>The sixth of the said King <HI>Edward,</HI> a Reformation was made for clipping of
the Kings Coyn; for which offence, two hundred sixty seven Jews were drawn
and hanged; three were English Christians, and other were English Jews.</P>
<P>The same year the Jews crucified a child at <HI>Northampton;</HI> for the which fact,
many Jews at <HI>London</HI> were drawn at Horses Tayls, and hanged.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="71"/>
The <HI>11th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Iohn Perkham,</HI> Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> com∣manded
the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> to destroy all the Jewes Synagogues in his
Diocese.</P>
<P>The <HI>16th</HI> of the said <HI>Edward,</HI> all the Jews in <HI>England,</HI> were (in one day) ap∣prehended
by precept from the King, but they redeemed themselves for twelve
thousand pounds of silver; notwithstanding, in the nineteenth of his Reign,
he banished them all out of <HI>England</HI> giving them only to bear their Charge, till
they were out of this Realm, the number of Jews then expulsed, were fifteen
thousand and sixty persons: the <HI>King</HI> made a mighty masse of money of their
Houses, which he sold, and yet the Commons of <HI>England</HI> had granted, and gave
him a fifteenth of all their Goods, to banish them; and thus much for the
Jewes.</P>
<P>In this street called the <HI>Old Iewry,</HI> is a proper Parish-Church of St. <HI>Olave Up∣well,</HI>
so called in Record, 1320, <HI>John Brian,</HI> Parson of St. <HI>Olave Upwell,</HI> in the
<HI>Iewry,</HI> founded there a Chauncery, and gave two Messuages to that Parish, the

Church to the commendations of the Parsons and Parishioners, the Monu∣ments,

from thence West to the North end of <HI>Ironmonger-lane,</HI> almost to the Parish
Church of St. <HI>Martin,</HI> (was of old time) one large building of stone, very
ancient, made in place of Jews Houses; but of what antiquity, or by whom
the same was builded, or for what use, is not known: more than that <HI>King

or Keeper thereof, unto <HI>John Stent,</HI> for terme of his life, by the name of his
principal Pallace in the <HI>Old Jewry.</HI> This was called the <HI>Old Wardrobe,</HI> but of

<P>Amongst divers fair Houses for Marchants, have ye three Halls of Compa∣nies,

is, I have not read. The next is the <HI>Weavers Hall,</HI> which Company hath

<P>Lower down, is the <HI>Girdlers Hall,</HI> and this is all touching the East side of this
Ward.</P>
<P>On the West side, almost at the South end thereof is <HI>Bakewell-Hall,</HI> corrupt∣ly
called <HI>Blackwell-Hall,</HI> concerning the Original whereof, I have heard divers
Opinious, which I over-passe as Fables, without colour of truth; for though
the same seemed a Building of great Antiquity, yet (in mine Opinion) the
Foundation thereof was first laid, since the Conquest of <HI>VVilliam,</HI> Duke of <HI>Nor∣mandy;</HI>
for the same was builded upon Vaults of Stone; which Stone was
brought from <HI>Cane</HI> in <HI>Normandy:</HI> The like of that in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, builded
by <HI>Mauritius</HI> and his Successors, Bishops of <HI>London;</HI> but that this House
hath bin a Temple, or Jewish Synagogue (as some have fantisied) I allow not,
seeing that it had no such form of roundness, or other likeness; neither had it
the form of a Church, for the Assembly of Christians, which are builded East
<PB N="124" REF="72"/>
and West; but contrariwise, the same was builded North and South, and in the
form of a Noblemans House, and therefore the best Opinion (in my judgement)
is, that it was (of old time) belonging to the Family of the <HI>Bassings,</HI> which was
in this Realm, a name of great Antiquity and Renown; and that it beares al∣so
the name of that Family, and was called therefore <HI>Basings-Haugh,</HI> or <HI>Hall.</HI></P>
<P>Now how <HI>Bakewell-hall</HI> took that name, is another Question, For which I
read, That <HI>Thomas Bakewel</HI> dwelled in this House, in the 36. of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>3d,</HI>
and that in the 20. of <HI>Richard</HI> the <HI>2d,</HI> the said <HI>King</HI> for the sum of 50. pounds,
which the Mayor and the Communalty, had paid into the <HI>Hanapar,</HI> granted Li∣cence,
so much as was in him, to <HI>Iohn Frosh, William Parker,</HI> and <HI>Stephen Spil∣man,</HI>
(Citizens and Mercers) that they, the said Messuage, called <HI>Bakewell-hall,</HI>
and one Garden, with the appurtenances, in the Parish of St. <HI>Michael</HI> of <HI>Bas∣sings-Haugh,</HI>
and of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> in the Jewry of <HI>London,</HI> and one Messuage,
two Shops, and one Garden, in the said Parish of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> which they held
of the King in <HI>Burgage,</HI> might give and assign to the Mayor and Communalty
for ever.</P>
<P>This <HI>Bakewell-Hall</HI> thus established, hath bin long since imployed, as a week∣ly
Market-place for all sorts of <HI>Woollen Clothes,</HI> broad and narrow, brought
from all parts of this Realm, there to be sold. In the 21. of <HI>Richard</HI> the second,
<HI>Richard Whittington</HI> Mayor; and in the 22, <HI>Drew Barringtine</HI> being Mayor, it
was decreed, that no Forraign or stranger, should sell any Woollen-Cloth; but
in <HI>Bakewell-hall,</HI> upon pain of forfeiture thereof.</P>
<P>This House (of late years) growing ruinous, and in danger of falling, <HI>Rich∣ard
May,</HI> Merchant-Taylor, at his decease, gave towards the new building of
the outward part thereof, <HI>300l.</HI> upon condition, that the same should be per∣formed,
within three years after his Decease; whereupon, the old <HI>Bakewell-Hall,</HI>
was taken down, and in the Moneth of <HI>February</HI> next following the foun∣dation
of a new, strong, and beautiful Store-house being laid, the work thereof
was so diligently applyed, that within the space of ten moneths after, to the
charges of two thousand five hundred pounds, the same was finished, in the
year 1588.</P>
<P>Next beyond this House, are placed divers fair Houses for Marchants, and o∣thers,
till ye come to the back Gate of <HI>Guild-hall;</HI> which Gate, and part of the
building within the same, is of this Ward: some small distance beyond this
Gate, the <HI>Coopers</HI> have their common Hall.</P>

The ruines of the Old Court Hall in <HI>Alderman-Bury-Street</HI> yet appear which of
late hath bin imployed as a Carpenters yard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Then is the parish Church of St. <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry Aldermanbury,</HI> a fair Church, with
a Church-yard and Cloyster adjoyning. In the which Cloyster is hanged and fast∣ned
a Shanke-bone of a man (as is said) very great, and larger by three inches and
a half, than that which hangeth in St. <HI>Laurence</HI> Church in the <HI>Iury,</HI> for it is in
length twenty Eight inches and a half of assise, but not so hard and Steely, like as
the other; for the same is Leight, and somewhat pory and spongy. This bone is
said to be found amongst the bones of men removed from the Charnell house of
<HI>Pauls,</HI> or rather from the Cloyster of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church.</P>
<P>Beneath this Church have ye <HI>Gayspur-lane,</HI> which runneth down to <HI>London</HI>
Wall, as is afore shewed. In this lane, at the North end thereof, was (of
old time) a house of <HI>Nuns,</HI> which house being in great decay <HI>William Elsing,</HI>
Mercer, in the year of Christ 1329. the third of <HI>Edward</HI> of the third, began in
place thereof the foundation of an Hospitall, for sustentation of one hundred
blind men: Towards the erection whereof, he gave his two houses in the Parish∣es
of St. <HI>Alphage</HI> and our Blessed <HI>Lady</HI> in <HI>Aldermanbury</HI> Near <HI>Cripplegate.</HI></P>
<P>This house was after called a <HI>Priory</HI> or <HI>Hospitall</HI> of St. <HI>Mary</HI> the <HI>Virgin,</HI> found∣ed
in the year 1332. by <HI>W. Elsing</HI> for <HI>Canons</HI> Regular, the which <HI>W.</HI> became
the first Prior there.</P>
<P>In the same place where the aforesaid <HI>Elsing</HI> Spittle and priory, were formerly
scituated, there is now newly erected a Colledge for the Clergy of <HI>London,</HI> and
Liberties thereof, called by the name of <HI>Sion-Colledge:</HI> And Almes-houses for
twenty poor people, ten men and ten women.</P>
<P>This was done by the especiall care and paines of Mr. <HI>Iohn Simson,</HI> Rector of
St. <HI>Olaves</HI> Hart-Street <HI>London,</HI> one of the Executors of the last Will and Testa∣ment
of Mr. <HI>Thomas White,</HI> Doctor in Divinity, Vicar of S. <HI>Dunstans</HI> in the
West, and one of the Canons Residentiary of S. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church <HI>London:</HI> which
ore-named <HI>Thomas White,</HI> (besides sundry sums of money, and great yearly
Revenues given by him to pious and Charitable uses in divers places) gave three
thousand pound to purchase and build the foresaid Colledge for the use of the
Clergy, and Almes-houses for the twenty poor people aforesaid.</P>
<P>He gave also unto the said Colledge, and Almes-houses, a hundred sixty pound,
<HI>per annum</HI> for ever; whereof there is a hundred twenty pound yearly allowed
for the maintenance of the poor Almes-men and women: And forty pound
yearly for four dinners for the Clergy, who are to have four Latine Sermons in
the year one every quarter, and upon these dayes are to dine together in the Col∣ledge.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="73"/>
In the same Colledge the forenamed <HI>Iohn Simson</HI> did in his life time, at his
own proper Costs and Charges, build a very faire and spacious Library, con∣taining,
a hundred twenty one foot in length, within the Walls, and above
twenty five foot in breadth. And hath furnished it with Wainscot, Stalls,
Desks, Seats, and other Necessary and usefull Ornaments befitting the
place.</P>
<P>To this Library there have been already divers bountifull, and well disposed
Benefactors, who have given large sums of money towards the furnishing of
it with Books.</P>
<P>Then is there the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Alphage;</HI> The principall Ile of this
Church towards the North, was pulled down, and a frame of four houses set
up in the place: the other part, from the Steeple upward, was converted into
a Parish Church of S. <HI>Alphage;</HI> and the Parish Church which stood near unto
the Wall of the City by <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> was pulled down; the plot thereof made
a Carpenters Yard, with Saw-pits.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hospitall</HI> it self, the <HI>Prior,</HI> and Canons house, with other Lodgings
were made a dwelling house, the Church-Yard is a Garden plot, and a faire
Gallery on the Cloyster, the Lodgins for the poor are translated into stabling
for horses.</P>
<P>Now we will return to <HI>Milk-Street</HI> so call'd of Milke sold there at the be∣ginning.
In this <HI>Milk-Street,</HI> is a small Parish Church of Saint <HI>Mary Mag∣delen,</HI>
which hath of late years been repaired. <HI>William Brown,</HI> Mayor 1513. gave
to this Church fourty pounds, and was buried there.</P>
<P>Then Next is <HI>Wood-Street,</HI> by what reason so called, I know not. True it is,
that (of old time) according to a Decree made in the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the first,
the houses of <HI>London</HI> were builded of Stone, for defence of fire, which kind
of building was used for two hundred years or more, but of latter time, for
the winning of ground, taken down; and houses of Timber were set up in
their place. It seemeth therefore that this Street hath been of the latter build∣ing,
all of timber, (for scarce one house of stone hath been known there) and
therefore called <HI>Wood-Street:</HI> otherwise it might take the name of some buil∣der
or owner thereof.</P>
<P>On the East side of this Street is one of the Prison-houses, pertaining to the
<HI>Sheriffs</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and is called the <HI>Compter</HI> in <HI>Wood-Street,</HI> which was pre∣pared
to be a prison-house in the year 1555. And on the Eve of S. <HI>Michael</HI> the
Archangell, the prisoners that lay in the Compter in <HI>Bread-Street,</HI> were remo∣ved
to this Compter in <HI>Wood-Street.</HI> Beneath this Compter in <HI>Lad-lane,</HI> or
<HI>Ladle Hall,</HI> for so I find it of Record, in the parish of Saint <HI>Michaell Wood-Street;</HI>
and Beneath that is <HI>Love lane,</HI> so called of <HI>wantons.</HI></P>
<P>By this lane is the Ancient parish Church of S. <HI>Albans.</HI> One note of the
great Antiquity of it, is the name, by which it was at first dedicated to St. <HI>Albanus,</HI>
the first Martyr of England. Another Character of the Antiquity of it, is to be
seen in the manner of the turning of the Arches in the windows, and heads of the
Pillars. A third Note, appears in the <HI>Roman</HI> Bricks, here and there here and there inlayed
amongst the stones of the building. Very probable it is, that this Church is at least
of as ancient a standing as King <HI>Aldelstane</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> who, as the Tradition sayes,
had his house at the East end of this Church. This Kings house, having a door al∣so
into <HI>Adel-Street</HI> in this Parish, gave name, as 'tis thought, unto the said
<HI>Adel-Street,</HI> which in all Evidences to this day, is written King <HI>Adel-Street.</HI>
One great square Tower of this Kings house seems yet remaining, to be seen at the
North corner of <HI>Love lane,</HI> as you come from <HI>Alderman-bury;</HI> which Tower
is of the very same stone and manner of building with S. <HI>Albans</HI> Church.</P>
<P>There is also (but without any outward Monument) the head of <HI>Iames</HI> the
Fourth King of <HI>Scots</HI> of that name, slain at <HI>Flodden</HI> field, and buried here by this
occasion: After the Battell, the body of the said King being found, was closed
<PB N="304" REF="74"/>
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead, and conveyed from thence to <HI>London,</HI> and so to the Monastery of <HI>Sheine</HI>
in <HI>Surrey,</HI> where it remained for a time, in what order I am not certain: But
since the dissolution of that house, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, <HI>Henry
Gray</HI> Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> being lodged and keeping house there, the same body was
to be shew'd, so lapped in lead, close to the head and body, thrown into a waste
room amongst the old timber, lead, &amp; other rubble; since which time, the work∣men
there (for their foolish pleasure) hewed off his head; and <HI>Launcelot Young,</HI>
Master Glasier to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> feeling a sweet savour to come from thence,
and seeing the same dried from all moisture, and yet the form remaining, with
the hair of the head and beard red, brought it into <HI>London,</HI> to his house in <HI>Wood∣street,</HI>
where (for a time) he kept it for the sweetnesse; but in the end, caused
the Sexton of that Church, to bury it amongst other bones, taken out of their
Charnell, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are divers Records of a house in <HI>Wood-street,</HI> then called <HI>Black Hall,</HI>
but no man at this day can tell thereof. On the North side of this Saint <HI>Mi∣chaels</HI>
Church is <HI>Maiden-lane,</HI> now so called, but (of old time) <HI>Ingene-lane,</HI> or
<HI>Inglane.</HI> In this Lane the <HI>Wax-Chaundlers</HI> have their Common Hall, on the
the South side thereof; and the <HI>Haberdashers</HI> have their Hall on the North
side, at <HI>Stayning-lane</HI> end. This Company of the <HI>Haberdashers,</HI> or <HI>Hurrers,</HI> of
old time so called, were incorporated a Brotherhood of St. <HI>Katherines,</HI> the
twenty sixth of <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, and so confirmed by <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, the se∣venteenth
of his Reign; the <HI>Cappers</HI> and <HI>Hat-Merchants,</HI> or <HI>Hurrers,</HI> being one
Company of <HI>Haberdashers.</HI></P>
<P>Down lower in <HI>VVood-street</HI> is <HI>Silver-street</HI> (I think, of Silver-Smiths dwel∣ling
there) in which be divers fair houses.</P>
<P>And on the North side thereof is <HI>Monks-well</HI> street, so called, of a well, at the
North end thereof, where the Abbot of <HI>Garendon</HI> had an house or Cell, called
<HI>Saint Iames</HI> in the wall by <HI>Cripple-gate,</HI> and certain Monks of their house were
Chaplains there; wherefore the Well (belonging to that Cell or Hermitage)
was called <HI>Monks-well,</HI> and the street of the well, <HI>Monks-well street.</HI> The East
side of this street down against <HI>London</HI> wall, and the South side thereof to <HI>Crip∣ple-gate,</HI>
be of <HI>Cripple-gate</HI> Ward, as is afore-shewed.</P>
<P>In this street, by the corner of <HI>Monks-well street,</HI> is the <HI>Bowyers Hall.</HI> On
the East side of <HI>Monks-well street,</HI> be convenient Alms-houses, <HI>twelve</HI> in num∣ber,
founded by Sir <HI>Ambrose Nicholas,</HI> Salter, Maior. 1575. wherein he placed
twelve poor and aged people rent-free, having each of them seven pence the
week, and once the yeer each of them five sacks of <HI>Charcoals,</HI> and one quartem
of one hundred of <HI>Faggots,</HI> of his gift for ever.</P>
<P>On the North side of the way, turning towards <HI>Cripple-gate,</HI> and even upon,
or close to <HI>London</HI> wall, (as it were) are certain new erected <HI>Almes-houses,</HI> six
in number, of the cost and gift of Mr. <HI>Robert Rogers,</HI> Leather-Seller, and very
good maintenance allowed (for ever) to such people as are appointed to dwell
in them.</P>
<P>Then, in little <HI>VVood-street,</HI> be seven proper Chambers in an Alley on the
West side, founded for seven poor people, therein to dwell rent-free, by <HI>Henry
Barton,</HI> Skinner, Maior, 1516.</P>
<P>Now without the Postern of <HI>Cripple-gate,</HI> first is the Parish Church of Saint
<HI>Giles,</HI> a very fair and large Church, lately repaired, after that the same was burn∣ed,
in the yeer 1545, the thirty seventh of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, by which mis∣chance,
the Monuments of the dead in this Church are very few.</P>
<P>In <HI>VVhite Crosse-street</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth builded a fair house, and founded
there a <HI>Brotherhood</HI> of S. <HI>Giles</HI> to be kept, which house had sometime been an
Hospitall of the <HI>French</HI> Order, by the name of Saint <HI>Giles</HI> without <HI>Cripple-gate.</HI>
In the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, the King having the Jurisdiction, and pointing
a <HI>Custos</HI> thereof, for the Precinct of the Parish of Saint <HI>Giles,</HI> &amp;c. which Hospi∣tall
<PB N="305" REF="74"/>
being suppressed, the lands were given to the Brotherhood for relief of the
poor.</P>
<P>One Alley, of divers Tenements, over against the North wall of Saint <HI>Giles</HI>
Church-yard, was appointed to be <HI>Alms-houses,</HI> for the poor, wherein they
dwelled rent-free, and otherwise were releeved; but the said Brotherhood was
suppressed by <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, since which time, Sir <HI>Iohn Gresham,</HI> Maior, pur∣chased
the lands, and gave part thereof to the maintenance of a <HI>Free School,</HI>
which he had founded at <HI>Holt,</HI> a Market-town in <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Red Crosse-street,</HI> on the West side from S. <HI>Giles</HI> Church-yard, up to the
said Crosse, be many fair houses builded outward, with divers Alleys, turning
into a large plot of ground, of old time called the <HI>Iews Garden,</HI> as being the only
place appointed them in <HI>England,</HI> wherein to bury their dead, till the year 1177,
the twenty fourth of <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, that it was permitted them (after long
suit to the King and Parliament at <HI>Oxford)</HI> to have a speciall place assigned
them in every quarter where they dwelled.</P>
<P>On the East side of this <HI>Red Crosse-street,</HI> be also divers fair houses, up to the
<HI>Crosse,</HI> and there is <HI>Beech-lane,</HI> peradventure so called of <HI>Nicholas de la Beech,</HI>
Lievtenant of the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> put out of that office in the thirteenth of
<HI>Edward</HI> the Third. This Lane stretcheth from <HI>Red Crosse-street</HI> to <HI>VVhite Crosse-street,</HI>
replenished not with Beech trees, but with beautifull houses of Stone,
Brick, and Timber: Amongst the which was (of old time) a great house per∣taining
to the Abbot of <HI>Ramsey,</HI> for his lodging, when he repaired to the City;
it is now called <HI>Drewry House,</HI> of Sir <HI>Drew Drewry,</HI> who dwelt there.</P>
<P>On the North side of this <HI>Beech-lane,</HI> towards <HI>VVhite Crosse street,</HI> the <HI>Dra∣pers</HI>
of <HI>London</HI> have lately builded eight <HI>Alms-houses</HI> of Brick and Timber,
for eight poor widows of their own Company, whom they placed there
rent-free.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Golding-lane: Richard Gallard</HI> of <HI>Islington</HI> Esquire, Citizen and
<HI>Painter-Stainer</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> founded thirteen <HI>Alms-houses,</HI> for so many poor peo∣ple
placed in them rent-free. He gave to the poor of the same <HI>Alms-houses,</HI>
two pence the peece weekly, and a load of <HI>Charcoals</HI> among them yeerly for
ever: He left fair lands about <HI>Islington,</HI> to maintain his Foundation. <HI>T. Hayes,</HI>
sometime Chamberlain of <HI>London,</HI> in the latter time of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, mar∣ried
<HI>Elizabeth,</HI> his daughter and heir, which <HI>Hayes</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had a daughter
named <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to <HI>Iohn Ironmonger,</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Mercer, who had the
ordering of the Alms-people.</P>
<P>On the West side of <HI>Red Crosse-street,</HI> is a street called the <HI>Barbican,</HI> because
sometime there stood on the North side thereof a <HI>Burghkenning</HI> or <HI>VVatch-tower</HI>
of the City, called in some language a <HI>Barbican,</HI> as a <HI>Bikening</HI> is called <HI>Beacon.</HI>
This <HI>Burgh-kenning,</HI> by the name of the Mannour of <HI>Base Court,</HI> was given by
<HI>Edward</HI> the Third, to <HI>Robert Ufford</HI> Earl of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and was afterward pertaining,
to <HI>Peregrine Barty,</HI> Lord <HI>VVilloughby</HI> of <HI>Ersby.</HI></P>
<P>Next adjoyning to this, is one other great house, called <HI>Garter Place,</HI> some∣time
builded by Sir <HI>Thomas VVrithe,</HI> or <HI>VVrithesly,</HI> Knight, <HI>aliàs Garter,</HI> princi∣pall
King of Arms, second son of Sir <HI>Iohn VVrithe,</HI> Knight, <HI>aliàs Garter,</HI> and
was Uncle to the first <HI>Thomas,</HI> Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> Knight of the Garter, and
<HI>Chancellor</HI> of <HI>England:</HI> He built this house, and in the top thereof a Chappell,
which he dedicated by the name of S. <HI>Trinitatis in Alto.</HI></P>

<P>THe Next is <HI>Aldersgate Ward,</HI> taking name of that North Gate of the
City: this Ward also consisteth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> divers Streets and Lanes, lying
as well within the Gate and Wall, as without, And first, to speak of
that part within the Gate, thus it is, the East part thereof joyneth
unto the West part of <HI>Cripplegate Ward,</HI> in <HI>Engain lane,</HI> or <HI>Maiden lane;</HI> It
beginneth on the North side of that Lane, at <HI>Staining lane End</HI> runneth
up, from the <HI>Haberdashers Hall,</HI> to St. <HI>Mary Staining Church,</HI> and by the

which is also of that ward, to <HI>Maiden lane;</HI> and so on that North side West to
Saint <HI>Iohn Zacharies</HI> Church, and to <HI>Foster lane.</HI> Now on the south side of

<HI>Kery lane</HI> it self (which is of this ward) and back again into <HI>Engain lane,</HI> by

that Company, every of them having Eight pence the peece every Friday for
ever, by the gift of <HI>Thomas Huntlow,</HI> Haberdasher, one of the Sheriffs, in the

<P>Then is the small Parish Church of Saint <HI>Mary,</HI> called <HI>Staining,</HI> because it
standeth, at the North end of <HI>Staining lane.</HI></P>

<P>On the East side of this <HI>Foster</HI> Lane, at <HI>Engane</HI> Lane end, is <HI>Goldsmiths Hall,</HI> a
proper House, but not large; and therefore to say▪ that <HI>Bartholmew Read</HI> Gold∣smith,
Mayor in the year 1502 kept such a feast in this Hall, as some have fabu∣led,
is far incredible, and altogether unpossible, considering the smallnesse
of the Hall, &amp; number of the Guests, which as they say, were more than one hun∣dred
persons of great estate; But of late years the said Goldsmiths Hall is
much enlarged and in a stately and sumptuous manner, in so much that it may
compare with any other Hall in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Then at the North end of <HI>Noble-street,</HI> is the Parish Church of St. <HI>Olave</HI> in
<HI>Silver-street,</HI> a small thing.</P>
<P>On the West side of <HI>Foster-Lane,</HI> is the small Parish Church of St. <HI>Leonards,</HI>

North side is the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Anne in the Willowes,</HI> so called, I know
not upon what occasion, but some say, of <HI>Willowes</HI> growing thereabouts, but
now there is no such void place for <HI>Willowes</HI> to grow, more than the Church-yard,
wherein do grow some high Ash-trees to this day.</P>
<P>Then in St. <HI>Martins</HI> Lane was (of old time) a fair and large <HI>Colledge,</HI> of a
<HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Secular Canons</HI> or Priests, and was called Saint <HI>Martins le grand,</HI> foun∣ded
by <HI>Ingelricus,</HI> and <HI>Edwardus</HI> his Brother, in the year of Christ 1056, and
confirmed by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, as appeareth by his Charter, dated 1068.
This Colledge claimed great Priviledges of Sanctuary, and otherwise, as appea∣reth
in a Book written by a Notary of that House, about the year 1442 the
nineteenth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth: wherein, amongst other things, is set down and
declared that on the first of <HI>September,</HI> in the year aforesaid, a Souldier, priso∣ner
in <HI>Newgate,</HI> as he was led by an Officer towards the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> of <HI>London,</HI>
there came out of <HI>Panyer Alley</HI> five of his fellowship, and took him from the
Officer, brought him into Sanctuary, at the West door of St. <HI>Martins</HI> Church,
and took Grithe of that place; But the same day <HI>Philip Malpas,</HI> &amp; <HI>Robert Mar∣shall,</HI>
then Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> with many other entred the said Church, and for∣cibly
took out with them the said five men thither fled, led them fettered to the
Counter, and from thence chained by the Necks to <HI>Newgate:</HI> of which violent
taking, the Dean and Chapter in large manner complained to the King, and re∣quired
him as their Patron, to defend their Priviledges, like as his Predecessors
had done, &amp;c. All which complaint and suite, the Citizens by their Counsel
<HI>Markham</HI> Serjeant at the Law, <HI>Iohn Carpenter</HI> common Clerk of the City, and
others, learnedly answered, offering to prove, that the said place of St. <HI>Martin</HI>
had no such Immunity or Liberty, as was pretended. Notwithstanding, after
long debating of this Controversie, by the Kings commandment, &amp; assent of his
Councel in the <HI>Starr-Chamber,</HI> the Chancellour and Treasurer, sent a Writ
unto the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> charging them to bring the said five persons, with
the cause of their taking and withholding, afore the King in his <HI>Chancery</HI> on
the Vigil of <HI>Alhallowes:</HI> on which day, the said Sheriffs, with the Recorder and
Counsel of the City, brought and delivered them accordingly, afore the said
Lords; where the Chancellour, after he had declared the Kings Commandement,
sent them to St. <HI>Martins,</HI> there to abide freely, as in a place having Franchises,
whiles them liked, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Without <HI>Aldersgate</HI> on the East side of <HI>Aldersgate-street,</HI> is the <HI>Cookes</HI> Hall,

and had also but one Alderman; The whole great Ward of <HI>Faringdon,</HI> both
<HI>Intra</HI> and <HI>Extra</HI> took name of <HI>W. Farrendon</HI> Goldsmith, Alderman of that
Ward, and one of the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> in the year 1281, the ninth of <HI>Edward</HI>

<P>At the South-West corner of <HI>Wood-street,</HI> is the Parish Church of St, <HI>Peter</HI> the
Apostle, by the said Crosse: a proper Church. <HI>John Sha</HI> Goldsmith, Mayor, de∣ceased
1503, appointed by his Testament, the said Church and Steeple to be
new builded of his goods, with a flat roof. Notwithstanding, <HI>Tho. Wood</HI> Gold∣smith,
one of the Sheriffs 1491, is accounted a principal Benefactor, because
the roof of the middle Isle is supported by Images of Woodmen, thought to be at
his charge.</P>
<P>The long Shop, or Shed encroaching on the High-street before this Church
Wall, was licenced to be made in the year 1401, yielding to the Chamber of

one of the Gentlemen of the Kings Chappel, Citizen, and <HI>Cloth-worker</HI> of <HI>Lon∣don;</HI>
He deceased in the year 1577, and then gave it to the <HI>Cloth-workers</HI> of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>

<P>Then was there of old time, a hansome Parish Church of Saint <HI>Nicholas,</HI>
whereof the said Flesh-market took the name, and was called Saint <HI>Nicholas Shambles.</HI></P>
<P>This Church with the Tenements and Ornaments, was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth

House belonging to one <HI>Iohn Travers,</HI> who was then one of the Sheriffs of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
in the same year 1224 in which House they made themselves <HI>Cells,</HI> and
inhabited there for a certain time, till their number so encreased, and the Citi∣zens
devotion grew to be so great, that (within few years after) they were thence
removed, by the means of one <HI>Iohn Ewin</HI> Mercet, who purchased a void plot of
ground, near to St. <HI>Nicholas Shambles,</HI> where to erect an House for the said Fry∣ers.</P>
<P>Divers Citizens seemed herein to joyn with the said <HI>Iohn Ewin,</HI> and erected
there very beautiful Buildings, upon the same ground so formerly purchased by
<HI>John Ewin,</HI> and a great part builded at his own Charge, which he appropriated
to the Communalty of <HI>London,</HI> and then entred into the same Order of Friers,
as a Lay-Brother himself.</P>
<P>This whole Church contained in length three hundred foot, of the feet of St.
<HI>Paul,</HI> in breadth eighty nine foot, and in heighth from the ground to the roof,
sixty four foot, and two inches, &amp;c. It was consecrated 1325, and at the Ge∣nerall
suppression, was valued at thirty two pound, nineteen shillings; and sur∣rendred
the twelfth of <HI>November</HI> 1538, the thirty of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth: the Or∣naments
and goods being taken to the Kings use, the Church was shut up for a
time▪ and used as a Store-house of goods taken prizes from the French, but in
the year 1546, on the third of <HI>January,</HI> it was again set open, on the which day
preached at <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse the Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> where he declared the Kings
gift thereof to the City, for the relieving of the poor; which gift was inroll'd
by Patents.</P>

<P>The thirteenth of <HI>January,</HI> the thirty eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, an agree∣ment

In the year 1552, began the repairing of the <HI>Gray Fryars House,</HI> for the poor
fatherlesse Children; and in the Month of <HI>November,</HI> the children were taken
into the same, to the number of almost four hundred. On <HI>Christmas</HI> day in the

<P>For these sorts of poor, three several Houses were provided. First, for the

that was the late <HI>Gray Fryers</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and called it by the name of <HI>Christs Ho∣spitall,</HI>
where poor Children are trained up in the Knowledge of God, and some
vertuous exercises, to the overthrow of beggary.</P>

(at least) two hundred diseased persons, which are not only there lodged and
cured, but also fed and nourished.</P>
<P>For the third degree, they provided <HI>Bridewell,</HI> where the Vagabond and idle
Strumpet is chastised, and compelled to labour, to the overthrow of the vicious
life of idlenesse.</P>
<P>They provided also for the honest decayed housholder, that he should be re∣lieved
at home at his House, and in the Parish where he dwelled, by weekly re∣lief

out of the City, from clapping of dishes and ringing of Bells, to the great trouble
of the Citizens, &amp; also to the dangerous infection of many, that they should be

<P>This Steeple was repaired in the year 1462. and the Weather-Cock again

found to be of Copper, gilt over, and the length from the Bill to the Tail, be∣ing
four foot, and the breadth over the Wings, three foot and a half, it weighed
forty pounds, the Crosse from the Bole, to the Eagle (or Cock) was fifteen
foot and six inches of assize; the length thereof, overthwart, was five foot and
ten Inches, and the Compass of the Bole was nine foot and one inch. The inner
Body of this Crosse was Oak, the next Cover was lead, and the outermost was
of Copper red varnished. The Bole and Eagle, or Cock, were of Copper, and
gilt also. The height of the Steeple was 520 Foot, whereof the Stone-work
was 260 Foot, and the Spire was likewise 260 Foot. The length of the whole
Church is 240 Taylors yards, which make 720 Foot. The breadth thereof is

<P>In the midst of this <HI>Pardon Church-yard,</HI> was also a fair Chappel, first foun∣ded
by <HI>Gilbert Becket, Portgrave,</HI> and principal Magistrate of this City, in the
Reign of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> who was there buried.</P>
<P>There was also a Chappel at the North door of <HI>Pauls,</HI> founded by <HI>Walter

<P>There was furthermore, a fair Chappel of the Holy Ghost, in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church,

Many Liege-Men and Christian People, having begun a <HI>Fraternity</HI> and <HI>Guild,</HI>
to the honour of the most glorious name of <HI>Jesu Christ,</HI> our Saviour, in a place call∣ed
the Crowds of the Cathedral Church of <HI>Pauls</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> which hath continued
long time peaceably, till now of late; whereupon they have made request, and we
have taken upon us, the name and charge of the Foundation, to the laud of Almigh∣ty
God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and especially, to the honour of
<HI>Jesu,</HI> in whose honour the Fraternity was begun, &amp;c.</P>
<P>At the West end of this <HI>Iesus Chappel,</HI> under the Quire of <HI>Pauls,</HI> also was,
and is, a Parish-Church of St. <HI>Faith,</HI> commonly called St. <HI>Faith</HI> under <HI>Pauls,</HI>
which served (as still it doth) for the Stationers and others, dwelling in <HI>Pauls</HI>
Church-yard▪ <HI>Pater Noster Rowe,</HI> and the places near adjoyning.</P>
<P>The said Chappel of <HI>Jesus,</HI> being suppressed in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth,
the Parishioners of St. <HI>Faiths</HI> Church were removed into the same, as to a
place more sufficient for largeness and lightsomness, in the year 1551. and so
it remaineth.</P>
<P>In the East part of this Church-yard standeth <HI>Pauls</HI> School, lately new buil∣ded,
and endowed in the year 1512. by <HI>John Collet,</HI> Doctor of Divinity, and
Dean of <HI>Pauls,</HI> for a hundred fifty three poor mens Children, to be taught free
in the same School; for which he appointed a Master, a Sub-master or Usher,
and a Chaplain, with large stipends for ever, committing the over-sight thereof,
to the Masters, Wardens, and Assistants of the <HI>Mercers</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> because he
was Son to <HI>Henry Collet,</HI> Mercer, sometime Maior.</P>
<P>Near unto this School, on the North side thereof, was (of old time) a great
and high <HI>Clochier,</HI> or <HI>Bell-house,</HI> foure square, builded of stone, and in the same,
a most strong frame of Timber, with four Bells, the greatest of <HI>England:</HI> these
were called <HI>Jesus Bells,</HI> and belonging to <HI>Jesus Chappel:</HI> The same had a great
spire of Timber, covered with Lead, with the Image of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> on the top, but
was pulled down by Sir <HI>Miles Partridge</HI> Knight, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the
eighth: the common speech then was, that he did set one hundred pounds,
upon a cast at Dice against it, &amp; so won the said <HI>Clochier and Bells</HI> of the King, &amp;
then causing the <HI>Bells</HI> to be broken as they hung, the rest was pulled down: This
man was afterward executed on the Tower-Hill, for matters concerning the
Duke of <HI>Summerset,</HI> the fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth.</P>
<P>In the year 1561. the fourth of <HI>June,</HI> betwixt the houres of three and four of
the Clock in the Afternoon, the great Spire of the Steeple of St. <HI>Pauls Church,</HI>
was fired by lightening, which brake forth (as it seemed) two or three yards
beneath the foot of the Crosse, and from thence it burnt downward the spire to
the Battlements, Stone-work, and Bells, so furiously, that within the space of
four houres, the same Steeple, with all the roofs of the Church, were consu∣med,
to the great sorrow, and perpetual remembrance of the beholders; After
this mischance, the Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> directed her Letters to the Maior, willing
him to take order for speedy repairing of the same; And she, of her gracious
disposition, for the furtherance thereof, did presently give, and deliver in gold,
one thousand Marks, with a Warrant for a thousand Loads of Timber, to be ta∣ken
out of her Woods, or else-where.</P>
<P>The Citizens also gave first a great Benevolence, and after that three fifteens
to be speedily paid.</P>
<P>The Clergy of <HI>England,</HI> within the Province of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> granted the for∣tieth
part of the value of their Benefices, charged with first fruits, the thirtieth
part of such as were not so charged; but the Clergy of <HI>London</HI> Dioces, granted
the thirtieth part of all that payd first fruits, and the twentieth part of such as
had paid their fruits.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="79"/>
Six Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> and two Petty Canons of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, had
charge to further and oversee the work, wherein such expedition was used, that
within one Moneth next following the burning thereof, the
Church was covered with boards and Lead, in manner of a false roof, against
the Weather, and before the end of the said year, all the said Iles of the Church▪
were framed out of new Timber, covered with Lead, and fully fi∣nished.</P>
<P><HI>Pauls</HI> Church was full of great Monuments, the ancientest are of King <HI>Sibba,</HI>

Lord Maior and Aldermen, upon solemn dayes, when they came to <HI>Pauls</HI> to
walk to the <HI>Graves stone,</HI> where this <HI>Bishop</HI> lay; and Sir <HI>Edward Barkham,</HI> caused
a Table to be hung up there with Verses thereupon, called the <HI>Monument of

<P>Touching other remarkable peeces of Antiquity, which belong to St. <HI>Pauls</HI>
Church, I leave them to such a Person of knowledge and industry, who may

Church-yard, unto the next Gate, were first builded without the Wall of the
Church-yard, by <HI>Henry Walleis</HI> Mayor, in the year 1282. the rest of those Hou∣ses
go to the maintenance of <HI>London-Bridge.</HI></P>
<P>This street is now called <HI>Pater Noster Rowe,</HI> because of Stationers, or Text-Writers,
that dwelled there, who wrote, and sold all sorts of Books then in use,
namely, <HI>A. B. C.</HI> with the <HI>Pater Noster, Ave, Creed, Graces, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There dwelled also Turners of Beads, and they were called <HI>Pater Noster</HI>

<P>At the end of this <HI>Pater Noster Rowe,</HI> is <HI>Ave-mary</HI> lane, so called

<P>And at the end of that Lane, is likewise <HI>Creed-lane,</HI> lately so called, but some∣time

betwixt the South end of <HI>Warwick-lane,</HI> and the North end of <HI>Ave Mary</HI>
Lane.</P>
<P>At the North end of <HI>Ave Mary</HI> Lane, is one great House, builded of Stone
and Timber, of old time pertaining to <HI>Iohn Duke of Britain,</HI> Earl of <HI>Richmond,</HI> as
appeareth by the Records of <HI>Edward</HI> the second; since that, it was called <HI>Pem∣brooks</HI>
Inne, near unto <HI>Ludgate,</HI> as belonging to the Earls of <HI>Pembrooke,</HI> in the
times of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, the eighteenth year, and of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, in the
fourteenth year: it was after called <HI>Aburgaveny</HI> House, and belonged to <HI>Hen∣ry,</HI>
late Lord of <HI>Aburgaveny;</HI> but the Company of <HI>Stationers</HI> have since pur∣chased
it, and made it the Hall for the Meeting of their Society, converting the
Stone-work into a new fair Frame of Timber, and applying it to such serviceable
use, as themselves have thought convenient.</P>
<P>Betwixt the South end of <HI>Ave Mary</HI> Lane, and the North end of <HI>Creed-lane,</HI>
is the comming out of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church-yard, on the East, and the high street on

<HI>Order</HI> (sometime) had their Houses in <HI>Old-born,</HI> where they remained for the
space of five and fifty years, and then, in the year 1276. <HI>Gregory Rocksley,</HI>
Mayor, and the Barons of this City, granted and gave to <HI>Robert Kilwarby,</HI>
Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> two Lanes or wayes next the street of <HI>Baynards</HI>
Castle; and also the Tower of <HI>Mount fitchet,</HI> to be destroyed; in place of
which, the said <HI>Robert,</HI> builded the late new Church of the <HI>Black-Fryers,</HI> and
placed them therein; King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and <HI>Eleanor</HI> his Wife, were great
Benefactors thereunto: this was a large Church, and richly furnished with
Ornaments, wherein divers Parliaments, and other great Meetings have been
holden; namely, in the year 1450▪ the twenty eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, a
Parliament was begun at <HI>VVestminster,</HI> and adjourned to the <HI>Black Fryers</HI> in
<HI>London,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Leicester.</HI></P>
<P>In the year one thousand five hundred twenty two, the Emperor <HI>Charls</HI> the

<P>In the year one thousand five hundred twenty foure, the fifteenth of <HI>April,</HI> a
Parliament was begun at the <HI>Black Fryers,</HI> wherein was demanded a Subsidy of
800000. pounds, to be raised of Goods and Lands, four shillings in every pound;
and in the end, was granted two shillings of the pound, of their Goods and
Lands, that were worth twenty pound, or might dispend twenty pounds by the
year, and so upward, to be paid in two years.</P>
<P>This Parliament was adjourned to <HI>VVestminster,</HI> amongst the black <HI>Monks,</HI>
and ended in the Kings Palace there, the <HI>14th</HI> of <HI>August,</HI> at nine of the Clock
in the night, and was therefore called the <HI>Black Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>The same year, in the moneth of <HI>October,</HI> began a Parliament in the <HI>Black

Church was also taken down, but new builded, and enlarged in the year 1430.
the eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>VVilliam Eastfield</HI> Mayor, and the Communalty,

<P>At the West end of this Parish Church, is a small passage for people on foot,

<P>Now again, from the Conduit by <HI>Pauls</HI> Gate, on the North side, is a large
street, running West to <HI>Newgate;</HI> the first part whereof, from the Conduit
to the <HI>Shambles,</HI> (of selling <HI>Bladders</HI> there) called <HI>Bladder-street:</HI> then behind

to sell their Flesh meat upon, over the which Stall-Boards; they first builded
sheds, to keep off the Weather; but since that, (incroaching by little and little)
they have made their Stall-boards and sheds, fair Houses, meet for the principal

<HEAD>Of the two and Twentieth Ward, or Alder∣manry
of the City of London, called
Bread-street Ward.</HEAD>
<P>THen is <HI>Bread-street</HI> it self, so called, of <HI>Bread</HI> in old time there sold,
for it appeareth by Records, that in the year 1302, which was the
thirty of <HI>Edward</HI> the first the <HI>Bakers</HI> of <HI>London</HI> were bounden to sell
no Bread in their Shops or Houses, but in the Market, and that they
should have four <HI>Hall-motes</HI> in the year, at four several Terms, to determine of
enormities belonging to the said Company.</P>
<P>This street, giving the name to the whole Ward, beginneth in West <HI>Cheap,</HI>
almost by the Standard; and runneth down South, through or thwart <HI>Wath∣ling-street,</HI>
to <HI>Knight Riders-street</HI> aforesaid, where it endeth; This <HI>Bread-street</HI>
is wholly on both sides of this Ward, out of the which street, on the
East side is <HI>Basing Lane,</HI> a piece whereof, to wit, to, and over against the back
gate of the <HI>Red Lion</HI> in <HI>Wathling-street,</HI> is of this <HI>Bread-street</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Fryday-street</HI> beginning also in West <HI>Cheap,</HI> and runneth down South
through <HI>Wathling-street,</HI> to <HI>Knight-Ri∣ders</HI>
street, or old <HI>Fishstreet.</HI> This <HI>Fryday-street</HI>
is of <HI>Bread-street</HI> Ward, on the East side, from over against the North-East
corner of Saint <HI>Matthews</HI> Church, and on the West side, from the South
corner of the said Church, down as aforesaid.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Fryday-street,</HI> on the West side thereof, is a Lane, commonly called
<HI>Mayden Lane,</HI> or <HI>Distaffe Lane,</HI> corruptly for <HI>Distar Lane,</HI> which runneth West
into the old Exchange, and in this Lane is also one other Lane, on the South
side thereof; likewise called <HI>Distar Lane,</HI> which runneth down to <HI>Knight-Rider
street,</HI> or Old <HI>Fish-street</HI> And so be the bounds of this whole Ward.</P>
<P>Monuments to be noted here, first at <HI>Bread-street</HI> corner, the North-East end,
1595, of <HI>Thomas Tmolioson,</HI> causing in the High street of <HI>Cheap,</HI> a Vault to be
digged and made; there was sound at fifteen foot deep, a fair payement, like
unto that above ground, and at the further end, at the Channel, was found a
<HI>Tree,</HI> sawed into five steps, which was to step over some Brook, running out of
the West, towards <HI>Walbrooke,</HI> and upon the edge of the said Brook as it seemeth,
there were found lying along, the bodies of two great Trees, the ends whereof
were then sawed off, and firm Timber, as at the first when they fell, part of the
said Trees remain yet in the ground undigged; It was all forced ground,
untill they went past the Trees aforesaid, which was about seventeen foot
deep, or better; Thus much hath the ground of this City (in that place) been
raised from the main.</P>
<P>Next to be noted, the most beautiful Frame of fair Houses and Shops, that be
within the Walls of <HI>London,</HI> or else where in <HI>England,</HI> commonly called <HI>Gold∣smiths
Row,</HI> betwixt <HI>Bread-street</HI> end, and the Crosse in <HI>Cheap,</HI> but is within this

<P>Then for <HI>Watheling-street,</HI> which <HI>Leyland</HI> calleth <HI>Atheling,</HI> or <HI>Noble-street,</HI>
but since he sheweth no reason why, I rather take it to be so named, of the
great High-way of the same calling. True it is, that at this present the Inhabi∣tants
thereof are wealthy Drapers, Retailers of Wollen Cloths, both Broad
and Narrow, of all sorts, more than in any one street of this City.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="81"/>
Of the Old Exchange, I have noted in <HI>Faringdon</HI> Ward, wherefore I passe
down to <HI>Knight-Riders</HI> street, whereof I have also spoken in <HI>Cordwayner street</HI>
Ward; But in this part of the said <HI>Knight-Riders</HI> street, is a Fish-market
kept, and therefore called <HI>Old Fish-street,</HI> for a difference from <HI>New Fish∣street.</HI></P>
<P>In this Old <HI>Fishstreet,</HI> is one Row of small Houses, placed along in the mid∣dest
of <HI>Knight-Riders-street,</HI> which Row is also of <HI>Bread-street</HI> Ward. These
Houses, now possessed by Fishmongers, were at the first but moveable Boards,
or Stalls, set out on Market-daies, to shew their fish there to be sold, but procu∣ring
Licence to set up Sheds, they grew to shops, and by little and little, to tall
Houses of three or four Stories in height, and now is called <HI>Fish-street.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Walter Turke,</HI> Fishmonger, Mayor, 1349, had two Shops in Old <HI>Fish-street,</HI>
over against Saint <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church, the one rented at five shillings the year,
the other four shillings.</P>
<P><HI>Bread-street,</HI> so called of <HI>Bread</HI> sold there (as I said) is now wholly inhabited
by rich Marchants, and divers fair Inns be there, for good receit of Carriers,
and other Travellers to the City.</P>
<P>On the East side of this street, at the corner of <HI>Watheling</HI> street, is the come∣ly
Church of <HI>Alh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llowes</HI> in <HI>Bread-street.</HI></P>
<P>On the same side is <HI>Salters Hall,</HI> with six Alms-houses in number, builded for
poor decayed Brethren of that Company; This Hall was burned in the year
1539, and again re-edified.</P>
<P>Lower down, on the same side, is the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Mildred</HI> the
Virgin.</P>
<P>Out of this <HI>Bread-street,</HI> on the same side, is <HI>Basing</HI> Lane, a part whereof (as
is afore shewed) is of this Ward, but how it took the name of <HI>Basing,</HI> I have not
read; In the twentieth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, the same was called the
<HI>Bake-house,</HI> whether meant of the Kings Bake-house, or of Bakers dwel∣ling
there, and baking Bread to serve the Market in <HI>Bread-street,</HI> where the
Bread was sold, I know not, but sure I am, I have not read of <HI>Basing,</HI> or of <HI>Ger∣rard</HI>
the Gyant, to have any thing there to do.</P>
<P>On the South side of this Lane, is one great House, of old time builded upon
arched Vaults, and with arched Gates, of Stone brought from <HI>Cane</HI> in <HI>Nor∣mandy,</HI>
the same is now a common <HI>Ostrey</HI> for receit of Travellers, commonly
and corruptly called <HI>Gerrards Hall,</HI> of a Giant said to have dwelled there. In
the high roofed Hall of this House, sometime stood a large Firr-pole, which
reached to the roof thereof, and was said to be one of the sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es that <HI>Gerrard</HI> the
Gyant used in the Wars to run withal, there stood also a Ladder of the same
length, which (as they said) served to ascend to the top of the staff. Of later
years this Hall is altered in building, and divers rooms are made in it; Not∣withstanding,
the Pole is removed to once corner of the Hall, and the Ladder
hanged broken, upon a Wall in the yard.</P>
<P>Now on the West side of <HI>Breadstreet,</HI> amongst divers fair and large Houses
for Marchants, and fair Inns for Passengers, had ye one <HI>Prison-house</HI> pertaining
to the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> called the <HI>Compter</HI> in <HI>Bread-street,</HI> but in the year
1555, the Prisoners were removed from thence, to one other new <HI>Compter</HI> in
<HI>Wood-street,</HI> provided by the Cities purchase, and builded for that purpose, the
cause of which remove was this; <HI>Richard Husband</HI> Pasteler, Keeper of this
<HI>Compter</HI> in <HI>Breadstreet,</HI> being a willful and head-strong man, dealt (for his own
advantage) hard with the prisoners under his charge, having also servants such as
himself liked best for their bad usage, and would not for any complaint be re∣formed;
whereupon, in the year 1550, Sir <HI>Rowland Hill</HI> being Mayor, by
the assent of a Court of Aldermen, he was sent to the Goal of <HI>Newgate,</HI> for the
cruel handling of his prisoners, and it was commanded to the Keeper, to set

thence forth an Act made by the Common Councel, for the ordering of priso∣ners
in the <HI>Compters;</HI> all which notwithstanding, he continued as afore: For
being on a Jury, to enquire against a Sessions of Goal delivery, in the year
1552, it was found that the Prisoners were still hardly dealt with all for their
achates, and otherwise, as also that Thieves and Strumpets were there lodged
for four pence the night, whereby they might be safe from searches that were
made abroad, for the which enormities, and other not needfull to be recited,
he was indicted at that Session, but did rub it out, and could not be reformed,
till this remove of the prisoners, for the House in <HI>Bread-street</HI> was his own by
Lease, or otherwise, so that he could not be put from it.</P>
<P>Now in <HI>Friday</HI>-street, so called of <HI>Fishmongers</HI> dwelling there, and serving
<HI>Frydays</HI> Market, on the East side is a small Parish Church commonly called
Saint <HI>John Evangelist.</HI> The Monuments therein be, of <HI>John Dogget,</HI> Merchant-Taylor,
one of the Sheriffs in the year 1509.</P>
<P>Then lower down, is another Church of Saint <HI>Margaret Moyses,</HI> so
called (as seemeth) of one <HI>Moyses,</HI> that was Founder, or new Builder
thereof.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Distar</HI> Lane, on the North side thereof is the <HI>Cordwayners</HI> or <HI>Shooma∣kers
Hall,</HI> which Company were made a Brotherhood or Fraternity, in the ele∣venth
of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Twentie third Ward, or Alder∣manry
of the City of London, called
Queen-hithe Ward.</HEAD>
<P>NExt unto <HI>Bread-street</HI> Ward, on the South side thereof, is <HI>Queen-Hith</HI>
Ward, so called of a Water-gate, or Harborow for Boats,
Lighters, and Barges, and was (of old time) for Ships: at what
time, the Timber Bridge at <HI>London,</HI> was drawn up, for the passage
of them to the said Hith, as to a principal Strand for landing and unlading a∣gainst
the middest and heart of the City; this Ward beginneth in the East, in
<HI>Knight-Riders-street;</HI> on the South side thereof, at the East end of the Parish
Church called the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> and runneth West on the South side, to a Lane
called <HI>Lambert Hill,</HI> which is the length of the Ward in <HI>Knight-Riders</HI> street,
out of the which street are divers Lanes, running South to <HI>Thames</HI> street, and are
of this Ward; the first is <HI>Trinity</HI> Lane, which runneth down by the West end of
<HI>Trinity</HI> Church; Then is <HI>Spuren</HI> Lane, or <HI>Spooners</HI> Lane, now called <HI>Huggen</HI>
Lane; Then <HI>Bread-street</HI> Hill, Then Saint <HI>Mary Mounthaunt,</HI> out of the which
Lane, on the East side thereof, is one other Lane, turning East through St. <HI>Nicho∣las
Olaves</HI> Church-yard, to <HI>Bread-street</HI> Hill; This Lane is called <HI>Finimore</HI> Lane,
or <HI>Five foot</HI> Lane, because it is but five foot in breadth; at the West end, in the
middest of this Lane, runneth down one other Lane broader, South to <HI>Thames</HI>
street, I think the same to be called <HI>Desborne Lane;</HI> for we read of such a Lane
<PB N="321" REF="82"/>
to have been in the Parish of Saint <HI>Mary Summerset</HI> in the twenty two of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the third where there is said to ly between the Tenement of <HI>Edward de
Mountacute</HI> Knight, on the East part, and the Tenement sometime pertaining
to <HI>William Gladwine,</HI> on the West, one plot of ground, containing in length to∣wards
<HI>Thames</HI> street, twenty five foot, &amp;c. Last of all have ye <HI>Lambart</HI> Hill,
so called of one <HI>Lambart</HI> owner thereof, and this is the farthest West part of this
Ward.</P>
<P>First in <HI>Knight-Riders</HI> street is the small Parish Church of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI>
lately very old, and in danger of down falling, Collections were made for the
repairing thereof; but they would not stretch so far; until a general means
was made, as appeareth by a publick notice thereof, declared in the said
Church.</P>
<P>Towards the West end of <HI>Knight-Riders</HI> street, is the Parish Church of Saint
<HI>Nicholas Cold Abbey,</HI> a proper Church somewhat ancient, as appeareth by the
waies raysed there about, so that men are forced to descend into the body of
the Church, it hath been called of many <HI>Colden Abbey,</HI> of some Cold Abbey or
Cold Bay, and so have the most ancient Writings; as standing in a cold place, as
<HI>Cold Harbor,</HI> and such like, the Steeple or tall Tower of this Church, with the
South Ile, hath been of later building, to wit, the first of <HI>Richard</HI> the second,
when it was meant, that the whole old Church should have been new buil∣ded,
as appeareth by the Arching begun on the East side the Steeple, under
the which, in the Stone work, the Armes of one <HI>Buckland,</HI> Esquire, and his
Wife, Daughter to <HI>Beaupere,</HI> are cut in Stone, and also are in the Glasse Win∣dows,
whereby it appeareth, he was the Builder thereof, and Repairer of the
residue.</P>
<P>In <HI>Trinity</HI> Lane, on the West side thereof, is the <HI>Painter Stainers</HI> Hall, for so
of old time were they called, but now that workmanship of <HI>Staining</HI> is depar∣ted
and out of use in <HI>England.</HI> Lower down in <HI>Trinity</HI> Lane, on the East side
thereof, was sometime a great Messuage pertaining unto <HI>Iohn</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwall,</HI>
in the fourteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third.</P>
<P>On <HI>Bread-street</HI> Hill, down to the <HI>Thames,</HI> on both sides, be divers fair
Houses, inhabited by Fishmongers, Cheesemongers, and Merchants of divers
Trades; on the West side whereof is the Parish Church of St. <HI>Nicholas Olave,</HI> a
convenient Church.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Old Fish-street</HI> Hill, a passage so called, which also runneth down
to <HI>Thames</HI> street; In this Lane, on the East side thereof, is the one end of <HI>Fini∣more</HI>
or Five foor Lane.</P>
<P>On the West side of this Old <HI>Fish</HI>-street Hill, is the Bishop of <HI>Hereford</HI>'s
Inne, or lodging, an ancient House, and large rooms, builded of Stone and
Timber, which sometime belonged to the <HI>Mounthaunts</HI> in <HI>Norfolke. Radul∣phus
de Mayden-stone,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hereford</HI> about the year, one thousand two
hundred thirty four, bought it of the <HI>Mounthaunts,</HI> and gave it to the Bi∣shops
of <HI>Hereford,</HI> his Successors. <HI>Charles,</HI> both Bishop of <HI>Hereford,</HI> and Chan∣cellour
of the Marches, about the year 1517 repaired it, since the which time,
the same is greatly ruined, and is now divided into many small Tenements;
The Hall, and principall Rooms, are in House to make Sugar-Loaves,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>Next adjoyning is the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Mary de Monte</HI> also, or
<HI>Mounthaunt;</HI> this is a very small Church, and at the first builded to be a
Chappel for the said House of the <HI>Mounthaunts,</HI> and for Tenements thereun∣to
belonging.</P>
<P>On the East side of this Old <HI>Fish</HI>-street Hill, is one great House, now
letten out for Rent, which House sometime was one of the Halls pertai∣ning
to the Company of <HI>Fishmongers,</HI> at such time as they had six Hall-Motes
<PB N="322" REF="83"/>
or Meeting places, namely, twain in <HI>Bridge-street,</HI> or New <HI>Fish-street,</HI>
twain in Old <HI>Fish-street,</HI> whereof this was one, and twain in Stock-Fish∣monger
Row, or <HI>Thames</HI> street, as appeareth by a Record the twenty two of
<HI>Richard</HI> the second.</P>
<P>Next Westward is one other Lane, called <HI>Lambart Hill,</HI> the East side
wherof is wholly of this Ward, and but half the West side, to wit, from
the North end of the <HI>Black-smiths</HI> Hall.</P>
<P>Then in <HI>Thames</HI> street, of this Ward, and on the North side over
against the Queens <HI>Hith,</HI> is the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> a con∣venient
Church, but all the Monuments therein are defaced.</P>
<P>At the West end of that Church, goeth up a Lane, called <HI>Pyel-lane;</HI> on
the same North side, at the South end of Saint <HI>Mary Mounthaunt</HI> Lane,
is the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Summerset,</HI> over against the <HI>Broken-Wharfe.</HI></P>
<P>Then is a small Parish Church of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> called <HI>parva,</HI> or little, near unto
<HI>Pauls</HI> Wharf. In this Church no Monuments do remain.</P>
<P>At the West end thereof is a Lane called Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Hill; but two
Houses up that Lane, on the East side, is of this Ward, and the rest is of <HI>Ca∣stle
Baynards</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>On the South side of <HI>Thames</HI> street, beginning again in the East a∣mong
the Cooks, the first in this Ward, is the Signe of <HI>David</HI> the
King.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Towns-end</HI> Lane, turning down to the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>Then is <HI>Queen-hithe,</HI> a large receptacle for Ships, Lighters, Barges, and
such other Vessels. Touching the Antiquity and use of this Gate and
Hithe, first I find, that the same belonged to one named <HI>Edred,</HI> and was then
called <HI>Edreds Hith,</HI> which since falling into the hands of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> it was
by his Charter confirmed to <HI>William de Ypre,</HI> the Farm thereof in Fee and in He∣ritage;
<HI>William de Ypre,</HI> gave it unto the Prior and Covent of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI>
within <HI>Ealdgate.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Edreds Hith,</HI> after the foresaid Grant, came again to the Kings hands,
by what means I have not read, but it pertained unto the Queen, and
therefore was called <HI>Ripa Reginae,</HI> the Queens Bank, or <HI>Queens-Hith,</HI> and
great profit thereof was made to her use, as may appear by this which fol∣loweth.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the ninth of his Reign, commanded the Con∣stables
of the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> to arrest the Ships of the Cinque-Ports
on the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and to compell them to bring their Corn to no
other place, but to the <HI>Queens Hith</HI> only. In the eleaventh of his Reign,
he charged the said Constable, to distrain all Fish offered to be sold in any
place of this City, but at the <HI>Queens Hith.</HI> Moreover, in the eight and
twentieth of his Reign, an Inquisition was made before <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Yorke,</HI>
and the Provost of <HI>Beverley, Henry</HI> of <HI>Bath,</HI> and <HI>Hierome</HI> of <HI>Caxton,</HI> Ju∣stices
<HI>Itinerantes,</HI> sitting in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> touching the Customs of
<HI>Queen-hith,</HI> observed in the year last before the Wars between the King
and his Father, and the Barons of <HI>England,</HI> and of old Customs of other
times, and what Customs had been changed, at what time the Tax and
Payment of all things coming thither, and between <HI>VVoore-path,</HI> and <HI>A∣nede
Hith,</HI> were found and seized, according to the old Order, as well
Corne and Fish, as of other things; All which Customes were as well to
be observed in the part of <HI>Down-gate,</HI> as in <HI>Queen-Hith,</HI> for the Kings
use, when also it was found, that the Corn arriving between the Gate of
Guild-Hall, of the Merchants of <HI>Colleyne,</HI> and the Soke of the Arch-Bi∣shop
of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> (for he had a House near unto the <HI>Black-Fryers)</HI> was
<PB N="323" REF="83"/>
not to be measured by any other quarter, than by that of the Queens
Soke.</P>
<P>Next adjoyning to this <HI>Queen-hith,</HI> on the West side thereof, is <HI>Salt-Wharf,</HI>
named of Salt taken up, measured, and sold there.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Stew</HI> Lane, of a Stew, or Hot-house there kept.</P>
<P>After that is <HI>Timber-Hith,</HI> or Timber street, so called, of Timber, or
Boards, there taken up, and wharsed; it is in the Parish of Saint <HI>Mary Som∣mers
Hith,</HI> as we read in the fifty six of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and in the ninth of
<HI>Edward</HI> the second.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Brookes Wharfe,</HI> and <HI>Broken Wharfe,</HI> a Water-gate or Key, so called of
being broken and fallen down into the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>By this <HI>Broken-VVharfe</HI> remaineth one large old building of Stone, with
Arched Gates; which Messuage, as we finde, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the
third, the forty three year, pertained unto <HI>Hugh de Bigot,</HI> and in the
eleaventh of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, to <HI>Thomas Brotherton,</HI> the Kings Brother,
Earle of <HI>Norfolke,</HI> Marshall of <HI>England,</HI> in the eleventh of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth,
to <HI>Iohn Mowbray</HI> Duke of <HI>Norfolk, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Within the Gate of this House (now belonging to the City of <HI>Lon∣don)</HI>
is lately, to wit, in the year 1594. and 1595, builded one
large House, of great height, called an Engine, made by <HI>Bevis Bulmar,</HI>
Gentleman, for the conveying and forcing of Thames water, to serve in
the middle and West parts of the City; the ancient great Hall of this
Messuage, is yet standing, and pertaining to a great Brew-House for
Beere.</P>
<P>West from this is <HI>Trigge</HI> Lane, going down to the <HI>Thames.</HI> Next is called
<HI>Bosse</HI>-Lane of a Bosse of water, like unto that of <HI>Belingsgate,</HI> there placed by
the Executors of <HI>Richard Whittington.</HI></P>
<P>Then is one great Messuage, sometime belonging to the Abbots of
<HI>Chartsey,</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> and was their Inne, wherein they were lodged
when they repaired to the City: it is now called <HI>Sandie</HI> House, by what
reason we have not heard; some think the Lord <HI>Sands</HI> hath been lodged
there.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Twentie fourth Ward, or Alder∣manry
of the City of London, called
Castle-Baynard Ward.</HEAD>
<P>THen next is <HI>Castle Baynard</HI> Ward, so named of an old Castle there;
This Ward beginneth in the East on the <HI>Thames</HI> side, at an House
called, <HI>Huntington House,</HI> and runneth West by <HI>Pauls Wharfe,</HI> by
<HI>Baynards Castle, Puddle Wharfe,</HI> and by the South side of <HI>Black-Fry∣ers;</HI>
Then turning by the East Wall of the said Fryers to the South-West end of
<HI>Creed Lane;</HI> then on the North side of <HI>Thames</HI> street, over against <HI>Huntington</HI>
House, by St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church and Lane, called <HI>Peter Hill,</HI> along till over against
<HI>Puddle Wharfe,</HI> and then North up by the great <HI>Wardrobe,</HI> to the West end of
<HI>Carter Lane;</HI> Then up <HI>Creed Lane, Ave Mary Lane,</HI> and a piece of <HI>Pater noster
Row,</HI> to the Sign of the <HI>Golden Lion,</HI> and back again up <HI>Warwick Lane,</HI> all the
East side thereof, to the Sign of the <HI>Crown</HI> by <HI>Newgate-Market;</HI> and this is the
farthest North part of this Ward.</P>
<P>Then out of <HI>Thames</HI> street be Lanes ascending North to <HI>Knight-Riders street;</HI>
The first is <HI>Peters Hill</HI> Lane, all of that Ward, (two Houses excepted, adjoy∣ning
to St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church) The next is <HI>Pauls Wharfe Hill,</HI> which thwarting
<HI>Knight-Riders street,</HI> and <HI>Carter Lane,</HI> goeth up to the South Chain of <HI>Pauls</HI>
Church-yard.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Adle-street,</HI> over against the West part of <HI>Baynards Castle,</HI> going up
by the West end of <HI>Knight-Riders</HI> street, and to <HI>Carter Lane.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much for Lanes out of <HI>Thames</HI> street. The one half of the West side of
<HI>Lambert Hill Lane</HI> being of this Ward, at the North-west end thereof, on the
South side, and at the West end of St. <HI>Mary Magdalens</HI> Church; on the North
side, beginneth <HI>Knight-Riders</HI> street to be of this Ward, and runneth West on
both sides, to the Parish Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI> by the <HI>Wardrobe.</HI></P>
<P>Then at the said East end of St. <HI>Mary Magdalens</HI> Church, goeth up the <HI>Old
Exchange,</HI> all the West side whereof, upto the South-East gate of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church-yard,
and by St. <HI>Austins</HI> Church, is of this Ward.</P>
<P>About the midst of this Old Exchange, on the West side thereof, is <HI>Carter
Lane,</HI> which runneth West to the East entry of the <HI>Black-Fryers,</HI> and the South
end of <HI>Creed-Lane,</HI> out of the which <HI>Carter Lane</HI> descendeth a Lane, called <HI>Do∣little
Lane,</HI> and commeth into <HI>Knight-Riders</HI> street, by the <HI>Boar-head</HI> Tavern,
and more West is <HI>Sermon Lane,</HI> by an Inne called the <HI>Powl-head.</HI> Then out of
<HI>Carter Lane,</HI> on the North side thereof, the South Chain of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church-yard,
and the Church-yard it self, on that South side of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, and the Church
of St. <HI>Gregory,</HI> the <HI>Bishops Palace,</HI> and the <HI>Deans Lodging,</HI> be all of this Ward
and such be the bounds thereof.</P>
<P>The Ornaments in this Ward, be Parish Churches four, of old time a Castle'
divers Noble-mens Houses, Halls of Companies twain, and such others as
shall be shewed.</P>
<P>In <HI>Thames</HI> street at the South-East end, is an ancient Messuage, of old time
called <HI>Beaumonts Inne,</HI> as belonging to that Family of Noble-men of this
Realm, in the fourth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth in the fifth of his
Reign, gave it to <HI>W. Hastings,</HI> Lord Chamberlaine, Master of his <HI>Mints;</HI> It is
how called <HI>Huntington House,</HI> as belonging to the Earls of <HI>Huntington.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="84"/>
Next is <HI>Pauls Wharfe</HI> a large landing place, with a common Stayre upon the
River of Thames, at the end of a street called <HI>Pauls Wharf Hill,</HI> which runneth
down from <HI>Pauls Chain.</HI></P>
<P>Next is a great Messuage, called <HI>Scroopes Inne,</HI> sometime belonging to the
<HI>Scroopes,</HI> in the thirty one of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth.</P>
<P>Then is one other great Messuage, sometime belonging to the <HI>Abbey</HI> of <HI>Fis∣campe,</HI>
beyond the Sea, and by reason of the Wars, it coming to the hands of
King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the same was given to Sir <HI>Simon Burley,</HI> Knight of the
Gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, and therefore called <HI>Burley</HI> House in <HI>Thames</HI> street, between <HI>Baynards
Castle</HI> and <HI>Pauls Wharfe.</HI></P>
<P>Then have you <HI>Baynards Castle,</HI> whereof this whole Ward taketh name; This
Castle banketh on the River <HI>Thames,</HI> and was callest <HI>Baynards Castle,</HI> of <HI>Baynard</HI>
a Nobleman, that came in with <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, of the which <HI>Ca∣stle</HI>
and of <HI>Baynard</HI> himself, we have spoken in another place. There was also a∣nother
Tower by <HI>Baynards</HI> Castle, builded by King <HI>Edward</HI> the second. <HI>Edward</HI>
the third, in the second of his Reign, gave it to <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Hamelake,</HI> in
the County of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and his Heirs, for one Rose yearly to be paid for all ser∣vice;
the same place (as seemeth) was since called <HI>Legates Inne,</HI> in
the seventh of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, where be now divers <HI>Wood-Wharfes</HI> in the
place.</P>
<P>Then is there a great <HI>Brew-house,</HI> and <HI>Puddle-Wharfe,</HI> a Water-gate into the
Thames, where Houses use to be watered, and therefore being filled with their
trampling &amp; made puddle-like, as also of one <HI>Puddle</HI> dwelling there, it is call'd
<HI>Puddle Wharfe.</HI> Then is there a Lane between the Black Fryars and the Thames,
called in the twenty six of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Castle-lane.</HI> This Ward ascendeth
up by the East VVall of the <HI>Black-Fryers,</HI> to the South VVest end of <HI>Creed Lane</HI>
where it endeth on that side. Then to begin again on the North side of <HI>Thames</HI>-street,
over against <HI>Huntington</HI> House, by St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church and Lane, called <HI>Pe∣ter
Hill,</HI> and so to St. <HI>Bennet Hude,</HI> (or <HI>Hithe)</HI> over against <HI>Pauls VVharfe,</HI> is a
convenient Parish Church, which hath the Monuments of Sir <HI>VVilliam Cheny</HI>
Knight, and <HI>Margaret</HI> his VVife 1442 buried there.</P>
<P>VVest from this Church, by the South end of <HI>Addle street,</HI> almost against
<HI>Puddle VVharfe,</HI> there is one ancient building of Stone and Timber, builded by
the Lords of <HI>Barkley,</HI> and therefore called <HI>Barkleys Inne.</HI> This House is now all
in ruine, and letten out in several Tenements, yet the Arms of the Lord
<HI>Barkley</HI> remain in the Stone-work of an arched Gate, and is between a <HI>Cheve∣ron</HI>
Crosses ten, three, and four.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Beauchampe,</HI> Earl of <HI>VVarwick,</HI> was lodged in this House, then cal∣led
<HI>Barkleys Inne,</HI> in the Parish of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth;
Then turning up towards the North▪ is the Parish Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI> in the
<HI>VVardrobe,</HI> a proper Church, but few Monuments hath it. <HI>Iohn Parnt</HI> hath
founded a Chauntrey there.</P>
<P>Then is the Kings great <HI>VVardrobe,</HI> Sir <HI>Iohn Beauchamp</HI> Knight of the Garter,
<HI>Constable</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> Warden of the <HI>Cinqueports,</HI> (son to <HI>Guido de Beauchamp</HI>
Earl of <HI>VVarwick)</HI> builded this House, was lodged there, deceased in the year
1359, and was buried on the South side of the middle Ile of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church. His
Executors sold the House to King <HI>Edward</HI> the third. Touching La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es ascen∣ding

side thereof, by <HI>David Smith</HI> Embroyderer, for six poor Widdows, whereof
each to have twenty shillings by the year. At the upper end of this Lane towards
the North the corner Houses there, be called <HI>Peter Key,</HI> but the reason thereof
we have not heard. Then is <HI>Pauls VVharfe,</HI> on the East side whereof is
<HI>VVoodmongers Hall.</HI> And next adjoyning is <HI>Darby-house,</HI> sometime belonging
to the <HI>Stanleys,</HI> for <HI>Thomas Stanley:</HI> first Earl of <HI>Darby,</HI> of that name, who mar∣ried

the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> Countesse of <HI>Richmond,</HI> Mother to <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh,
in his time builded it. Queen <HI>Mary</HI> gave it to <HI>Gilbert Dethick,</HI> then <HI>Garter,</HI>
principal King of Arms of English men; <HI>Thomas Hauley, Clarentieux,</HI> King of
Arms of the South parts; <HI>VVilliam Harvey</HI> aliàs <HI>Norroy,</HI> King of Armes of the

and Pursevants of Arms, and their Successors might (at their liking) dwell to∣gether,
and at meet times congregate, speak, confer, and agree among them∣selves,
for the good Government of their Faculty, and their Records might be
more safely kept, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the West side of this street is one other great House builded of Stone,
which belongeth to <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, and was sometime lette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the <HI>Blunts,</HI> Lord

<HI>Doctors of the Civil Law,</HI> and <HI>Arches,</HI> who keep a Commons there; and many of
them being lodged there, it is called the <HI>Doctors Commons.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Lambard</HI> Hill Lane, on the West side thereof, is the <HI>Black-smiths Hall.</HI>
Over-against the North-west end of this <HI>Lambard</HI> Hill Lane in <HI>Knight-Riders</HI>
street, is the Parish Church of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> a small Church, having but
few Monuments.</P>
<P>By the East end of St. <HI>Mary Magdalene</HI> Church, runneth up the <HI>Old Exchange</HI>
Lane, by the West end of <HI>Carter Lane,</HI> to the South-East Gate or Chaine of
<HI>Pauls Church-yard,</HI> as is before shewed; And in this part was the <HI>Exchange</HI>
kept, and <HI>Bullion</HI> was received for <HI>Coynage,</HI> as is noted in <HI>Faringdon</HI> Ward
Within.</P>
<P>In this Parish Church of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> out of <HI>Knight-Riders</HI> street, up
to <HI>Carter</HI> Lane, be two small Lanes, the one of them called <HI>Doo-little</HI> Lane, as
a place not inhabited by Artificers, or open Shop-keepers, but serving for a
near passage from <HI>Knight-Riders</HI> street to <HI>Carter-Lane.</HI> The other corruptly

<HEAD>Of the Twentie fifth Ward, or Alder∣manry
of the City of London, called
Farringdon Ward without,
or Extra.</HEAD>
<P>THe farthest West-ward of this City, being the twenty fifth Ward of
<HI>London,</HI> but without the Walls, is called <HI>Farringdon without,</HI> and
was of old time, part of the other <HI>Faringdon within,</HI> until the seven∣teenth
of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, that it was devided and made twain,
by the names of <HI>Faringdon Intra,</HI> and <HI>Faringdon Extra,</HI> as is afore shewed.</P>
<P>Touching Ornaments and Antiquities in this Ward; First, betwixt the said
<HI>Newgate,</HI> and the Parish of St. <HI>Sepulchres,</HI> is a way towards <HI>Smithfield,</HI> called
<HI>Gilt-Spur,</HI> or <HI>Knight-Riders street,</HI> of the Knights and other riding that way into
<HI>Smithfield,</HI> replenished with buildings on both sides up to <HI>Pye-corner,</HI> a place so
called of such a Sign, sometimes a fair Inne, for receipt of Travellers, but now
divided into Tenements, and over against the said <HI>Pye-corner,</HI> lyeth <HI>Cock-lane,</HI>
which runneth down to <HI>Oldburn</HI> Conduit. Beyond this <HI>Pye-corner,</HI> lyeth <HI>VVest
Smithfield,</HI> compassed about with buildings: at first on the South side, following
the right hand standeth the large <HI>Hospital</HI> of St. <HI>Bartholmews,</HI> founded by <HI>Rahere,</HI>
the first <HI>Prior</HI> of Saint <HI>Bartholmewes</HI> thereto near adjoyning, in the year,
1102.</P>
<P><HI>Alfune,</HI> that had not long before builded the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Giles,</HI>
without <HI>Creplegate,</HI> became first <HI>Hospitelar,</HI> or <HI>Proctor</HI> for the poor of this House
and went himself daily to the Shambles and other Markets, where he Begged
the Charity of devout people for their relief, promising to the liberall givers,
(and that by alledging Testimonies of the holy Scripture) reward at the hands
of God. <HI>Henry</HI> the third, granted to <HI>Katherine</HI> late Wife to <HI>VVilliam Hardell,</HI>
twenty foot of Land in length and breadth in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> next to the Chappel
of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> to build a Recluse or <HI>Ankorage,</HI> commanding the Mayor
and Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> to assign the said twenty foot to the said <HI>Katherine,</HI> the
eleventh of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the foundation of this Hospital for the poor and
diseased, and their special sustentation, was confirmed by <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the
twenty sixth of his Reign; It was governed by a Master, and eight Brethren be∣ing
Priests, for the Church, and four Sisters to see the poor served.</P>
<P>This Hospitall was valued at the suppression, in the year 1539, the thirty
one of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to five and thirty pounds, six shillings, seven, pence
yearly. The Church remaineth a Parish Church to the Tenents dwelling in
the Precinct of the Hospital; But in the year 1546, on the thirteenth of <HI>Ianua∣ry,</HI>
the Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> preaching at <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse, declared the gift of the
said King to the Citizens, for relieving of the poor, which contained the
Church of the <HI>Grey Fryers,</HI> the Church of Saint <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> with the Hospital,
the Messuages, and appurrenances in <HI>Gilt-Spur,</HI> aliàs <HI>Knight-Riders street,
Briton</HI> street, <HI>Peter Key,</HI> in the Parish of Saint <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> in old
<HI>Fish-street,</HI> and in the Parish of Saint <HI>Bennet, Huda, Linie-hurst,</HI> or <HI>Limehost,</HI>
in the Parish of <HI>Stebunheth, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="86"/>
Then also were Orders devised for relief of the poor, the Inhabitants were
all called to their Parish Churches, where, by Sir <HI>Richard Dobbs,</HI> then Mayor,
their several <HI>Aldermen,</HI> or other grave Citizens, they were by eloquent Orati∣ons
perswaded, how great, and how many Commodities would ensue unto
them, and their City, if the poor of divers sorts, which they named, were taken
from out their streets, Lanes, and Alleys, and were bestowed and provided for
in Hospitals abroad, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore was every man moved, liberally to grant
(what they would impart) towards the preparing and furnishing of such Hos∣pitals;
and also, what they would contribute weekly towards their mainte∣nance
for a time, which (they said) should not be past one year, or twain, until
they were better furnished of endowment; To make short, every man granted
liberally, according to his ability. Books were drawn of the Relief in every
Ward of the City, towards the new Hospitals, and were delivered by the Major
to the Kings Commissioners, on the seventeenth of <HI>February;</HI> and order was
taken therein, at the six and twenty of <HI>Iuly.</HI> In the year 1552, the repairing of
the <HI>Gray Fryers</HI> House for poor Fatherless Children, was taken in hand; and
also, in the latter end of the same Moneth, began the repairing of this Hospi∣tall
of St. <HI>Bartholmew,</HI> and was of new endowed, and furnished at the charges
of the Citizens.</P>
<P>On the East side of this Hospital lyeth <HI>Duck-lane,</HI> which runneth out of
<HI>Smithfield</HI> South, to the North end of <HI>Little Britain</HI> street.</P>
<P>On the East side of this <HI>Duck-lane,</HI> and also of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> lyeth the late dis∣solved
Priory of St. <HI>Bartholmew,</HI> founded also by <HI>Rahere,</HI> a pleasant witted
Gentleman, and therefore in his time called the <HI>Kings Minstrel,</HI> about the year
of Christ, 1102. He founded it in a part of the before named Moorish ground,
which was therefore a common <HI>Lay-stall</HI> of all filth, that was to be voided out
of the City: He placed <HI>Canons</HI> there, himself became their first Prior, and so
continued till his dying day, and was there buried in a fair Monument, renewed
afterwards by Prior <HI>Bolton.</HI></P>
<P>To this Priory, King <HI>Henry</HI> the second, granted the priviledge of a <HI>Faire,</HI> to
be kept yearly at <HI>Bartholomew-tyde,</HI> for three dayes, to wit, the <HI>Eve,</HI> the <HI>Day,</HI> and
the next <HI>Morrow;</HI> to the which, the <HI>Clothiers</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Drapers</HI> of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
repaired, and had their Boothes and standings within the Church-yard of
this Prioty, closed in with Walls and Gates locked every night, and watched,
for safety of Mens Goods and Wares, a Court of <HI>Pipepowders</HI> was daily, during
the <HI>Faire</HI> holden, for debts and Contracts.</P>
<P>On the North side of this Priory, is the lane truly called <HI>Long,</HI> which reacheth
from <HI>Smithfield</HI> to <HI>Aldersgate-street.</HI></P>
<P>This Lane is now lately builded on both the sides, with Tenements for Bro∣kers,
Tiplers, and such like; the rest of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> from <HI>Long lane</HI> end, to the
Barres, is inclosed with Inns, Brew-houses, and large Tenements.</P>
<P>On the West side is <HI>Chicken-lane,</HI> down to <HI>Cow-bridge;</HI> then be the <HI>Pens</HI> or
<HI>Folds,</HI> so called of Sheep there parted, and penned up to be sold on the Market
dayes.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Smithfield</HI> Pond, which of (old time) in Records, was called <HI>Horse-Poole,</HI>
for that men watered Horses there, and was a great water.</P>
<P>In the sixth of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, a new Building was made in the West part of
<HI>Smithfield,</HI> betwixt the said Pool and the River of the Wells, or <HI>Turnmill-brook,</HI>
in a place then called the <HI>Elmes,</HI> for that there grew many Elm-Trees, and this
had bin the place of <HI>Execution</HI> for offenders; since the which time, the buil∣ding
there hath bin so increased, that now remaineth not one Tree
growing.</P>
<P>Amongst these new buildings is <HI>Cow-bridge</HI> street, or <HI>Cow-lane,</HI> which turn∣eth
toward <HI>Holdbourn;</HI> in vvhich Lane, the Prior of <HI>Semperingham</HI> had his Inne,
or <HI>London</HI> Lodging.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="86"/>
The rest of that West side of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> hath divers fair Inns, and other comely
Buildings, up to <HI>Hosier-lane,</HI> which also turneth down to <HI>Houldbourn,</HI> till it
meet with <HI>Cowbridge-street,</HI> from this Lane to <HI>Cock-lane,</HI> over against <HI>Pie-Corner.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1362, the thirty sixth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, on the first five dayes of
<HI>May,</HI> in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> were Justs holden, the King and Queen being present, with
the most part of the Chivalry of <HI>England,</HI> and of <HI>France,</HI> and of other Nation,
to the which came <HI>Spaniards, Cyprians,</HI> and <HI>Armenians,</HI> Knightly requesting aid
of the King of <HI>England,</HI> against the Pagans that invaded their Con∣fines.</P>
<P>The 48. of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Dame Alice Perrers,</HI> or <HI>Pierce,</HI> (the Kings Con∣cubine)
as Lady of the Sun, rode from the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> through <HI>Cheape,</HI>
accompanied by many Lords and Ladies, every Lady leading a Lord by his
Horse Bridle, till they came into West <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and then began a great Just,
vvhich endured seven dayes after.</P>
<P>In the year 1393. the <HI>17th</HI> of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, certain Lords of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
came into <HI>England,</HI> to get vvorship, by force of Arms, the Earl of <HI>Marre</HI> cha∣lenged
the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> to Just vvith him, and so they rode together
certain Courses, but not the full Challenge, for the Earl of <HI>Marre</HI> was cast both
Horse and Man, and two of his Ribs broken vvith the fall, so that he vvas con∣veighed
out of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and so towards <HI>Scotland,</HI> but dyed by the vvay at
<HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>VVilliam Darel</HI> Knight, the Kings Banner-bearer of <HI>Scotland,</HI> challenged
Sir <HI>Percey Courtney</HI> Knight, the Kings Banner-bearer of <HI>England,</HI> and vvhen they
had run certain Courses, gave over vvithout conclusion of Victory: Then
<HI>Cookborne,</HI> Esquire of <HI>Scotland,</HI> challenged Sir <HI>Nicholas Hawberke</HI> Knight, and
rode five Courses; but <HI>Cookborne</HI> vvas born over Horse and Man.</P>
<P>Now to return through <HI>Gilt-spur-street</HI> by <HI>Newgate,</HI> vvhere I first began,
there standeth the fair Parish Church called St. <HI>Sepulchers</HI> in the Bayly, or by
Chamberlain Gate, in a fair Church-yard, though not so large as of old time;
for the same is letten out for buildings, and a Garden plot.</P>
<P>This Church vvas newly re-edified, or builded, about the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the
sixth, or of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, one of the <HI>Popham's,</HI> vvas a great builder there,
and 'tis lately also vvashed over, and furbish'd.</P>
<P>Next to this Church, is a fair and large Inne, for the receipt of Travellers,
and hath to signe the <HI>Sarasens</HI> Head, vvhere <HI>Oxford</HI> men resort.</P>
<P>There lyeth a street from <HI>Newgate,</HI> West, to the end of <HI>Turn again-lane,</HI> and
winding North to <HI>Oldbourne</HI> Conduit; but of late, a new Conduit vvas there
builded in place of the old, namely, in the year 1577. by <HI>VVilliam Lambe,</HI>
sometime a Gentleman of the Chappel to King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and after∣ward
a Citizen and Clothworker of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>From the West side of this Conduit, is the high way, there called <HI>Snow-hill,</HI>
stretching out by <HI>Oldbourne-bridge,</HI> over the oft-named Water of <HI>Turn-mill-Brook,</HI>
and so up to <HI>Old-bourn-hill,</HI> all replenished with fair Buildings.</P>
<P>Without <HI>Ould-bourn-bridge,</HI> on the right hand, is <HI>Gold-lane,</HI> as is before shew∣ed,
up higher on the Hill, be certain Inns, and other fair Buildings; amongst
the which, (of old time) was a Messuage called <HI>Scroops Inne,</HI> for so we finde the,
same recorded in the 37. of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth.</P>
<P>This House was sometime letten out to <HI>Sergeants at the Law,</HI> as appeareth,
and was found by Inquisition taken in the <HI>Guild-hall</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> before <HI>William
Purchase</HI> Mayor, and Escheater for King <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>7th,</HI> in the <HI>14th</HI> of his
Reign.</P>
<P>Then is the <HI>Bishop of Elies Inne,</HI> so called of, belonging and pertaining to the
Bishops of <HI>Ely, Will, de Luda▪</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> deceased 1297, and gave this House,
by the name of his Mannor, with the Appurrenances in <HI>Holdbourne,</HI> to his Suc∣cessors,
<PB N="330" REF="87"/>
with condition, that his next Successor should pay a thousand Marks, to∣wards
the finding of three <HI>Chaglains,</HI> in the Chappel there.</P>
<P>The first in the year 1464. the fourth of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, in <HI>Michaelmas</HI>
Terme, the Sergeants at Law, held their Feast in this House; to the which, a∣mongst
other Estates, <HI>Matthew Philip,</HI> Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> with the Aldermen,
Sheriffs, and Commons of divers Crafts, being invited, did repair; but when
the Mayor looked to keep the state in the Hall, as it had bin used in all places
within the City and Liberties (out of the Kings presence) the Lord <HI>Gray</HI> of
<HI>Ruthen,</HI> then Lord Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> unwitting the Sergeants, and against
their wills (as they said) was first placed, whereupon, the Mayor, Aldermen,
and Commons, departed home, and the Mayor made the Aldermen to dine
with him; howbeit, he and all the Citizens were wonderfully displeased that
he was so dealt with, and the new Sergeants and others, were right o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry there∣fore,
and had rather then much good (as they said) it had not so hap∣pened.</P>
<P>Next beyond this Mannor of <HI>Ely-house,</HI> is <HI>Lither-lane,</HI> turning into the
Fields. Then is <HI>Furnivals</HI> Inne, now an Inne of <HI>Chancery,</HI> but sometime be∣longing
to Sir <HI>William Furnival</HI> Knight, and <HI>Thomasin</HI> his Wife, who had in
<HI>Holdbourne</HI> two Messuages, and thirteen Shops, as appeareth by Record of
<HI>Richard</HI> the second, in the sixth of his Reign.</P>
<P>Now again from <HI>Newgate,</HI> on the left hand, or South side, lyeth the <HI>Old Bay∣lay,</HI>
which runneth down by the Wall, upon the Ditch of the City, called
<HI>Houndsditch,</HI> to <HI>Ludgate:</HI> we have not read how this street took that name; but
it is like to have risen of some Court of old time there kept; and we finde, that
in the year 1356. the thirty four of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the Tenement and
ground upon <HI>Houndsditch,</HI> between <HI>Ludgate</HI> on the South, and <HI>Newgate</HI> on the
North, was appointed to <HI>Iohn Cambridge,</HI> Fishmonger, Chamberlain of <HI>London,</HI>
whereby it seemeth, that the Chamberlains of <HI>London,</HI> have there kept their
Courts, as now they do in the <HI>Guild-hall:</HI> and till this day, the Mayor and Justi∣ces
of this City, keep their Sessions in a part thereof, now called the <HI>Sessions
Hall,</HI> both for the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Shire of <HI>Middlesex;</HI> over again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the
which House, on the right hand, turneth down St. <HI>Georges</HI> Lane, towards <HI>Fleet</HI>
Lane.</P>
<P>In this St. <HI>Georges</HI> Lane, on the North side thereof, remaineth yet an old wall
of stone, inclosing a peece of ground up <HI>Sea-cole-Lane,</HI> wherein (by report)
sometime stood an Inne of <HI>Chancery;</HI> which House being greatly decayed▪ and
standing remote from other Houses of that Profession, the Company removed
to a Common Hostery, called of the signe, out <HI>Lady Inne,</HI> not far from <HI>Cle∣ments
Inne,</HI> which they procured from Sir <HI>Iohn Fineox,</HI> Lord chief Justice of the
Kings Bench; and since, have held it of the owners, by the name of the <HI>New
Inne,</HI> paying therefore six pounds Rent, by the year, as Tenants at their own
will, for more (as is said) cannot be gotten of them, and much lesse, will they
be put from it.</P>
<P>Beneath this Saint <HI>Georges</HI> Lane, is the Lane called <HI>Fleet-lane,</HI> winding South
by the Prison of the Fleet, into <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> by <HI>Fleet-bridge.</HI></P>
<P>Next out of the high street, turneth down a Lane, called the <HI>Little Bayly,</HI>
which runneth down to the East end of St. <HI>Georges</HI> Lane.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Sea-cole-lane,</HI> I think, called <HI>Limeburners</HI> Lane, of burning Lime
there with Sea-cole; For we read in Record of such a Lane, to have bin in the
Parish of St. <HI>Sepulchre,</HI> and there yet remaineth in this Lane, an Alley, called
<HI>Lime-burners Alley.</HI></P>
<P>Near unto this <HI>Sea-cole-lane,</HI> in the turning towards <HI>Oldbourne</HI>-Conduit, is
<HI>Turn-again-lane,</HI> or rather, as in a Record of the fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third,
<HI>Wind-again-lane,</HI> for that it goeth down West to <HI>Fleet Dike,</HI> from whence, men
must turn again the same way they came, for there it is stopped.</P>

Then the high street turneth down <HI>Snow-hill,</HI> to <HI>Holdbourne</HI> Conduit, and
from thence, to <HI>Ouldbourn-bridge;</HI> beyond the which Bridge on the left hand,
is Shooe-lane, by the which, men passe from <HI>Ouldbourne</HI> to <HI>Fleet street,</HI> by the
Conduit there.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Shooe-lane,</HI> on the left hand, is one old House, called <HI>Oldbourn-Hall,</HI>
it is now letten out into divers Tenements.</P>
<P>On the other side, at the very corner, standeth the Parish Church of Saint
<HI>Andrew.</HI></P>
<P>From this Church to St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> up <HI>Oldbourn-hill,</HI> be divers fair builded
Houses; amongst the which, on the left hand, there standeth three Inns of
<HI>Chancery,</HI> whereof the first, adjoyning unto <HI>Crook-horn-Alley,</HI> is called <HI>Thavies

<P>Then is <HI>Fewter-lane,</HI> which stretcheth South into <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> by the East end
of St. <HI>Dunstanes Church,</HI> and is so called of <HI>Fewters</HI> (or idle people) lying there,
as in a way leading to <HI>Gardens;</HI> but the same is now of later years, on both sides
builded thorow with many fair Houses: and in the wast grounds and Gardens,

<P>Beyond this <HI>Fewters</HI> Lane, is <HI>Baynards</HI> Inne, aliàs <HI>Mackworths</HI> Inne, which
is of the <HI>Chancery.</HI></P>
<P>Then is <HI>Staple-Inne</HI> also of the <HI>Chancery,</HI> but whereof so named, I am igno∣rant;
the same of late, is (for a great part thereof) fair builded, and not a
little augmented; And then at the Barres endeth this Ward, without
<HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>Without <HI>Ludgate,</HI> on the right hand, or North side, from the said Gate lyeth
the <HI>Old Bayley,</HI> as I said, then the high street, called <HI>Ludgate-hill,</HI> down to <HI>Fleet</HI>-Lane;
in which Lane standeth the <HI>Fleet,</HI> a Prison-house, so called of the Fleet,
or water running by it, and sometime flowing about it, but now vaulted
over.</P>
<P>Then also, against the South end of <HI>Shooe-lane,</HI> standeth a fair Water-Conduit,
whereof <HI>William East field,</HI> sometime Mayor, was Founder; for the
Mayor and Commonalty of <HI>London,</HI> being possessed of a Conduit Head, with di∣vers
Springs of water gathered thereunto, in the Parish of <HI>Padington,</HI> and the
water conveyed from thence, by Pipes of Lead, towards <HI>London</HI> unto <HI>Teyborn,</HI>

at <HI>Maribone,</HI> which stretcheth from thence unto a separall, late before made a∣gainst
the Chappel of <HI>Rounseval,</HI> by <HI>Charing-Crosse,</HI> and no further; and then

or Receits for the same, unto the Common-weale of the Commonalty; to wit,
the poor to drink, the rich to dresse their Meats, which water was by them
brought thus into <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> to a Standard which they had made and finished

<P>From this Conduit up to <HI>Fewters</HI> Lane, and further, is the Parish Church of

And then next was sometime the House of the <HI>converted Iews,</HI> founded by
King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in place of a Jews House to him forfeited, in the year
1233. and the seventeenth of his Reign; who builded there for them, a fair
Church, now used, and called the Chappel; for the Custody of Rolles and Re∣cords
of Chancery, it standeth not far from the old Temple and the new; in the
which House, all such Jews and Infidels, as were converted to the Christian
Faith, were ordained and appointed (under an honest rule of life) sufficient
maintenance: whereby it came to passe, that in short time, there were gather∣ed
a great number of Converts which were baptized instructed in the Do∣ctrine
of Christ, and there lived under a learned Christian, appointed to go∣vern
them; since the which time, to wit, in the year 1290. all the Jews in
<HI>England,</HI> were banished out of the Realm, whereby the number of Converts in
this place was decayed, and therefore in the year 1377. this House was annexed
by Parent, to <HI>William Burstall</HI> Clark, <HI>Custos Rotulorum,</HI> or Keeper of the Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s

<P>Next is <HI>Bride-lane,</HI> and therein <HI>Bridewell,</HI> of old time the Kings House; for

was lodged himself at the <HI>Black-Fryers;</HI> but his Nobles, in this new builded
<HI>Bridewell,</HI> a Gallery being made out of the House over the Water, and thorow
the Wall of the City, into the Emperors Lodging at the <HI>Black-Fryers:</HI> King
<HI>Henry</HI> himself often times lodged there also; as namely, in the year 1525. a
Parliament being then holden in the <HI>Black-Fryers,</HI> he created States of Nobi∣lity
there.</P>
<P>In the year 1553. the seventh of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, the tenth of <HI>April,</HI> sir
<HI>George Barne,</HI> being Mayor of this City, was sent for to the Court at <HI>White-hall,</HI>
and there at that time the King gave unto him, for the Communalty and Citi∣zens,
to be a Work-house, for the poor and idle persons of the City, his house
of <HI>Bridewell:</HI> and seven hundred Marks Land, late of the possessions of the house
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and all the Bedding and other Furniture of the said Hospital of the
<HI>Savoy,</HI> towards the maintenance of the said Work-house of <HI>Bridewel,</HI> and the
Hospital of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>Southwark.</HI></P>
<P>This gift, King <HI>Edward</HI> confirmed by his Charter, dated the 26. of <HI>Iune,</HI> next
following. And in the year 1555. in the moneth of <HI>February,</HI> Sir <HI>William Ger∣rard</HI>
Mayor, and the Aldermen, entred <HI>Bridewel,</HI> and took possession thereof ac∣cording
to the gift of the said King <HI>Edward,</HI> the same being confirmed by Queen
<HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>The Bishop of St. <HI>Davids</HI> had his Inne over against the North side of this
<HI>Bridewell,</HI> as I have said.</P>
<P>Then is the Parish Church of St. <HI>Bridget,</HI> or <HI>Bride,</HI> of old time a small thing,
which now remaineth to be the Quire; but since, increased with a large Body,
<PB N="333" REF="88"/>
and side Iles, towards the West, at the charges of <HI>William Vinor</HI> E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quire, War∣den
of the Fleet, about the year 1480. all which he cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to be wrought about
in the stone, in the figure of a Vine, with Grapes and Leaves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The partition betwixt the old work and the new, sometime prepared as a
Screne, to be set up in the Hall of the Duke of <HI>Summersets</HI> House at the Strand,
was bought for eightscore pounds, and set up in the year, one thousand five
hundred fifty seven.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Salisbury Court,</HI> a place so called, for that it belonged to the Bi∣shops
of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and was their Inne, or <HI>London</HI> House, at such time as they
were summoned to come to the Parliam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, or came for other business: It
hath of late time bin the dwelling, first of Sir <HI>Richard Sackvile,</HI> and after, of Sir
<HI>Thomas Sackvile</HI> his Sonne, Baron of <HI>Buckhurst,</HI> Lord Treasurer, who very
greatly inlarged it with stately Buildings.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Water-lane,</HI> running down by the West side of a House, called the
<HI>Hanging Sword,</HI> to the Thames.</P>
<P>Then was the <HI>White Fryers</HI> Church, called <HI>Fratres beatae Mariae de monte Car∣meli,</HI>
first founded (saith <HI>Iohn Bale)</HI> by Sir <HI>Richard Gray,</HI> Knight, Ancestor to
the Lord <HI>Gray</HI> of <HI>Codner,</HI> in the year 1241.</P>
<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, gave to the Prior and Brethren of that house, a plot of
ground in <HI>Fleet-street;</HI> whereupon to build their House, which was since re∣edified,
or new builded, by <HI>Hugh Courtney,</HI> Earl of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> about the year
one thousand three hundred and fifty, the four and twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI>
the third.</P>
<P><HI>Iohn Lufken,</HI> Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and the Commonalty of the City, granted a
Lane, called <HI>Crockers-lane,</HI> reaching from <HI>Fleetstreet</HI> to the Thames, to build in
the West end of that Church.</P>
<P>Then is the <HI>Sergeants Inne,</HI> so called, for that divers <HI>Iudges</HI> and <HI>Sergeants</HI> at
the Law keep a Commons, and are lodged there in Terme time.</P>
<P>Next is the <HI>New Temple,</HI> so called, because the <HI>Templers,</HI> before the building
of this House had their Temple in <HI>Oldbourn:</HI> This house was founded by the
<HI>Knights Templers</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second▪ and the same
was dedicated to <HI>God,</HI> and our <HI>Blessed Lady,</HI> by <HI>Heraclius,</HI> Patriark of the
Church, called the Holy <HI>Resurrection in Jerusalem,</HI> in the year of Christ,
1185.</P>
<P>Many Parliaments and great Councels have been there kept, as may appear
by our Histories.</P>
<P>In the year 1308. all the Templers in <HI>England,</HI> as also in other parts of Chri∣stendom,
were apprehended, and committed to divers Prisons.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1310. a Provincial Councel was holden at <HI>London,</HI> against the Tem∣plets
in <HI>England,</HI> upon Heresie, and other Articles, whereof they were accused;
but denyed all, except one or two of them; notwithstanding, they all did con∣fesse,
that they could not purge themselves fully, as faultless, and so they were
condemned to perpetual <HI>penance,</HI> in several <HI>Monasteries,</HI> where they behaved
themselves modestly.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> procured their over-throw throughout the whole
World, and caused them to be condemned by a general Councel to his advan∣tage
as he thought; for he believed to have had all their Lands in <HI>France,</HI> and
therefore seizing the same in his hands, caused the Templers, to the number of
54. or after <HI>Fabian,</HI> threescore, to be burnt at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> the second, in the year 1313. gave unto <HI>Aimer de la Valence,</HI> Earl of
<HI>Pembrook,</HI> the whole place &amp; house, called the new Temple at <HI>London,</HI> with the
ground called <HI>Fiquetes Croft,</HI> and all the Tenements and Rents, with the ap∣purtenances
that belonged to the <HI>Templers</HI> in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Suburbs
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reof.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="89"/>
After <HI>Aimer de Valence</HI> (saith some) <HI>Hugh Spencer</HI> (usurping the same)
held it during his life; by whose death, it fell again to the hands of <HI>Edward</HI> the
third; but in the mean time, to wit, 1324. by a Councel holden at <HI>Vienna,</HI> all
the Lands of the Templers (lest the same should be put to prophane uses)
were given to the <HI>Knights Hospitalers,</HI> of the Order of St. <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> called
Saint <HI>Iohn of Ierusalem;</HI> which Knights had put the <HI>Turks</HI> out of the Ile of
<HI>Rhodes,</HI> and after, wan upon the said Turk, daily for a long time.</P>
<P>In the Reign of the same <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was granted (for a certain Rent of
ten pounds by the year) the said <HI>Temple,</HI> with the Appurtenances thereunto ad∣joyning,
to the Students of the Common Lawes of <HI>England,</HI> in whose possession,
the same hath ever sithence remained, and is now divided into two Houses of
several Students, by the name of <HI>Inns of Court,</HI> to wit, the <HI>Inner Temple,</HI> and the
<HI>Middle Temple,</HI> who keep two several Halls; but they resort all to the said
<HI>Temple-Church,</HI> in the round walk whereof, (which is the West part, without
the Quire) there remain Monuments of Noblemen, buried to the number of
eleven, eight of them are Images of Armed Knights, five lying Crosse-legged,
as men vowed to the Holy Land, against the Infidels, and unbelieving Jews, the
other three straight-legged. The rest are coaped stones, all of Gray Marble:
the first of the Crosse-legged, was <HI>William Marshal</HI> the elder, Earl of <HI>Pem∣brooke,</HI>
who died 1219. <HI>William Marshall</HI> his Sonne, Earl of <HI>Pembrooke,</HI>
was the second, he dyed 1231. And <HI>Gilbert Marshall,</HI> his Brother, Earl
of <HI>Pembrooke,</HI> slain in a Turnament at <HI>Hartford,</HI> besides <HI>Ware,</HI> in the year
1241.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Twenty sixth, or the last Ward of
the City of LONDON, called the
Bridge-Ward without, containing the
Bourough of Southwark.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now almost finished the <HI>Perambulation;</HI> for having treated of
Wards in <HI>London,</HI> on the North side of the <HI>Thames,</HI> (in number five and
twenty) we are now to crosse over the said River, into the Burough of
<HI>Southwark,</HI> which is also a Ward of <HI>London</HI> without the Walls, on the South
side thereof, as is <HI>Portsoken</HI> on the East, and <HI>Faringdon Extra</HI> on the
West.</P>
<P>But before we come to the particular Description of this Ward, it will not
be impertinent to declare, when, and by what meanes the <HI>Burough of South∣wark,</HI>
now called <HI>Bridge-Ward without,</HI> was made one of the six and twenty
Wards, belonging to the City of <HI>London,</HI> which was in this manner.</P>
<P>After the dissolution of the Monasteries, Abbeys, Priories, and other Reli∣gious
Houses, in this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> The Mayor, Commonalty, and Citi∣zens
of this City of <HI>London,</HI> taking into their Considerations, how commodi∣ous,
and convenient it would be unto the City, to have the Burough of <HI>South∣wark</HI>
annexed thereunto; and that the same Burough was in the Kings hands
wholly, they became humble suiters unto King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and unto the
Lords of his Highness Privy Councel, for the obtaining of the same. Which suit
not being granted unto them; after the Decease of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, they
<PB N="335" REF="89"/>
renewed their Suit unto his Sonne and next Successour, King <HI>Edward</HI> the
sixth, and to the Lords of his Privie Councel for the obtaining of the same Bo∣rough.</P>
<P>At the length, after long suit, and much labour, it pleased King <HI>Edward</HI> the
fixth, by his Letters Parents, sealed with the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> bearing date
at <HI>VVestminster</HI> the three and twentieth day of <HI>April,</HI> in the fourth year of his
Reign, as well in consideration of the sum of six hundred forty seven pounds,
two shillings and a penny, of lawful money of <HI>England,</HI> paid to his Highnesses
use, by the Mayor, Communalty, and Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> as for divers o∣ther
considerations him thereunto moving, To give and grant unto the said
Mayor, and Communalty, and Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> divers Messuages, Lands and
Tenements, lying near the Borough of <HI>Southwark,</HI> in the said Letters Parents,
particularly expressed, which were sometimes the Lands of <HI>Charles</HI> late Duke of
<HI>Suffolk,</HI> and of whom King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth did buy and purchase the same.
But there was excepted out of the said grant, and reserved unto the said King
<HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, his Heirs and Successors, and all that his Capitall Messuage, or
Mansion Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, called <HI>Southwark place,</HI> late of the said Duke of <HI>Suffolke,</HI> and

and all that his Messuage, and all Edifices and ground, called the <HI>Ante∣lope</HI>
there.</P>
<P>And the said King <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>6th,</HI> did by his said Letters Patents, give &amp; grant
to the said Mayor, Communalty, and Citizens, and their Successors, all that his
Lordship, and Mannor of <HI>Southwarke,</HI> with all and singular the Rights, Mem∣bers,
and Appurtenances thereof, in the said County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> then late be∣longing

Members, and Appurtenances thereof, in the said County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> then late
parcel of the Possessions of the Arch-Bishop and Bishoprick of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> toge∣ther
with divers yearly Rents, issuing out of the divers Messuages or Tene∣ments,
in the said Letters Patents particularly expressed.</P>
<P>But there was excepted and reserved out of the said Grant, to the said King
<HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, his Heirs, and Successors, all his Rights, Jurisdictions, Liber∣ties,
and Franchises whatsoever within the Walk, Circuit, and Precinct of his
Capital Messuage, Gardens, and Park in <HI>Southwarke;</HI> and in all Gardens, Curti∣lages,
and Lands, to the said Mansion House, Gardens, and Park belong∣ing.</P>
<P>Also, there was excepted and reserved out of the said Grant, the House, Messu∣age,
or lodging there, called the <HI>Kings-Bench,</HI> and the Gardens to the same be∣longing
so long as it should be used as a Prison for prisoners, as it was then
used.</P>
<P>Also, there was excepted and reserved out of the said Grant, the House, Mes∣suage,
or Lodging there called, the <HI>Marshalsey,</HI> and the Gardens to the same
belonging, so long as it should be used as a Prison for prisoners, as it was then
used.</P>
<P>Also, it was provided, that the said Letters Patents, should not be prejudicial
to the Offices of the great Master or Steward of the Kings Houshold, within the
Borough and Precincts aforesaid, to be executed while the same Borough and
Precincts should be within the <HI>Verge;</HI> Nor to <HI>Iohn Gates</HI> Knight, one of the
Gentlemen of the Kings Privy Chamber, concerning any Lands, Tenements,
Offices, Profits, Franchises, or Liberties to him granted during his life, by the
said King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, or by his Father King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth.</P>
<P>About the space of a Month after the said Borough of <HI>Southwark</HI> was so
granted by King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, to the Mayor Communalty and Citizens of
<HI>London,</HI> and that they by force of the said Letters Patents, stood charged with
the Ordering, Survey, and Government of the same Borough, and of all the
<PB N="336" REF="90"/>
Kings Subjects, inhabiting therein, and repairing thither. At a Court holden
before Sir <HI>Rowland Hill</HI> Knight, then Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and the Aldermen
of the same City, in the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the eight and twenti∣eth
of <HI>May,</HI> in the said fourth year of the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, the
said Town or Borough was named and called the Ward, or <HI>Bridge VVard
without.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after, it was enacted, that besides the then ancient accustomed num∣ber
of five and twenty Aldermen, there should be one Alderman more elected,
to have the Rule, Charge, and Governance of the said <HI>Borough</HI> and Town. And
that four discreet persons, or more, being Freemen of <HI>London,</HI> and dwelling
within the said City, or the <HI>Borough</HI> of <HI>Southwarke,</HI> or in other the Liberties of
the said City, should from thenceforth, as often as the Case shall require, be
from time to time nominated, appointed, and chosen by the Inhabitants of the
said <HI>Borough</HI> for the time being, before the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> for the time
being; And that the said Lord Mayor for the time being, should (at the next
Court of Aldermen, to be holden at the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> of the said City, next after
such election) present the Names and Sirnames of all such persons, as to should
be named before him, and put in the said Election; And that the said Lord
Mayor and Aldermen, for the time being, should of those four persons, or mo,
so presented, Elect and Chuse one, by way of <HI>Scrutinie;</HI> to be an Alderman of
the said City, and to have the peculiar Ordering, Rule, and Governance of the said
Borough and Town of <HI>Southwarke,</HI> and of the Inhabitants thereof, and of all
other the Kings liege people, repairing to the same.</P>
<P>This Borough being in the County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> consisteth of divers streets,
waies, and winding Lanes, all full of Buildings inhabited; And first, to begin
at the West part thereof, over against the West Suburbe of the City, on the Bank
of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> there is now a continual building of Tenements, about
half a mile in length to the Bridge.</P>
<P>Then South a continual street called <HI>Long Southwark,</HI> builded on both sides
with divers Lanes, and Alleys up to St. <HI>Georges</HI> Church, and beyond it through
<HI>Blackman</HI> street, towards <HI>New Town,</HI> (or <HI>Newington)</HI> the Liberties of which Bo∣rough,
extend almost to the Parish Church of <HI>New Town</HI> aforesaid, distant one
mile from <HI>London</HI> Bridge, and also South-west a continual building, almost to
<HI>Lambeth,</HI> more than one mile from the said Bridge.</P>
<P>Then from the Bridge along by the Thames East-ward, is St. <HI>Olaves</HI> street,
having continual building on both the sides, with Lanes and Alleys up to <HI>Bat∣tle-Bridge:</HI>
to <HI>Horse-down,</HI> and towards <HI>Rother-Hith</HI> also, some good half mile
in length from <HI>London</HI> Bridge, so that I account the whole continual buildings,
on the Bank of the said River, from the West towards the East to be more than
a large mile in length.</P>
<P>Then have ye from the entring towards the said <HI>Horse-down,</HI> one other con∣tinual
street, called <HI>Barmonds eye street,</HI> which stretcheth South, likewise furni∣shed
with Buildings on both the sides, almost half a mile in length up to the late
dissolved Monastery of St. <HI>Saviours,</HI> called <HI>Bermondsey.</HI></P>
<P>And from thence is one Long Lane (so called of the length) turning West
to St. <HI>Georges</HI> Church aforenamed, out of the which Lane, mentioned <HI>Long-lane,</HI>
breaketh one other street towards the South and by East, and this is called <HI>Ken∣tvsh-street,</HI>
for that it is the way leading into that County; and so have ye the
bounds of this Borough.</P>
<P>The Antiquities most notable in this Borough are these; First, for Ecclesia∣stical,
there was <HI>Bermondsey,</HI> an <HI>Abbey of Black Monks;</HI> St. <HI>Mary Overies,</HI> a
<HI>Priory</HI> of <HI>Canons Regular;</HI> St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> a <HI>Colledge</HI> or <HI>Hosp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tal</HI> for the poor; and
the <HI>Loke,</HI> a <HI>Lazar-house</HI> in <HI>Kent-street.</HI> Parish Churches there have been six,
whereof five do remain, <HI>(viz.)</HI> St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> in the Priory of Saint
<HI>Mary Overy;</HI> Now the same St. <HI>Mary Overy</HI> is the Parish Church for the said
<PB N="337" REF="90"/>
<HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and for Saint <HI>Margaret</HI> on the Hill, and is called Saint <HI>Sa∣viour.</HI></P>
<P>Saint <HI>Margaret</HI> on the Hill, being put down is now a Court for Justice; St.
<HI>Thomas</HI> in the <HI>Hospital</HI> serveth for a Parish Church as afore; St <HI>George</HI> a Parish
Church, as before it did; so doth St, <HI>Olave,</HI> and St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> by the Abby
of <HI>Bermondsey.</HI></P>
<P>There be also these five Prisons, or Goals, the <HI>Clink</HI> on the Bank, the <HI>Compter</HI>
in the late Parish Church of St. <HI>Margaret,</HI> the <HI>Marshalsey,</HI> the <HI>Kings-Bench,</HI>
and the <HI>White-Lyon,</HI> all in <HI>Long Southwarke.</HI></P>
<P>Now to return to the West Bank, there were two <HI>Bear-Gardens,</HI> the old and
new, places wherein were kept <HI>Bears, Bulls,</HI> and other Beasts, to be bated;
As also Mastives, in se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eral Kenels, nourished to baite them. These Bears and
other Beasts are there baired in plots of ground, Scaffolded about, for the be∣holders
to stand safe; but this kind of sport is now prohibited. Next, on this Bank,
was sometime the <HI>Bord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llo</HI> or <HI>Stewes,</HI> a place so called of certain <HI>Stew-houses,</HI> pri∣viledged
there, for the repair of incontinent men, to the like women, of the
which Priviledge we read thus.</P>
<P>In a Parliament holden at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the eight of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, it was
ordained by the Commons, and confirmed by the King and Lords, That divers
constitutions for ever should he kept in that Lordship or Franchise, according to
the old Customs, that had been there used time out of mind; Amongst the
which, these following were some, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That no <HI>Stew-holder,</HI> or his Wife should let or stay any single Woman to go
and come freely at all times, when they listed.</P>
<P>No <HI>Stew-holder</HI> to keep any Woman to board, but she to board abroad at her
pleasure. To take no more for the Womans Chamber in the week than four∣teen
pence.</P>
<P>Not to keep open his doors upon the <HI>Holy-daies.</HI></P>
<P>Not to keep any single Woman in his House on the <HI>Holy-dayes;</HI> but the Bay∣liff
to see them voided out of the Lordship.</P>
<P>No single Woman to be kept against her will that would leave her sin.</P>
<P>No <HI>Stew-holder</HI> to receive any Woman of Religion, or any Mans Wife.</P>
<P>No single Woman to take mony to lye with any man, except she lie with him
all night till the morrow. No man to be drawn or enticed into any <HI>Stew-house.</HI></P>
<P>The Constables, Bayliffe, and others, every week to search every <HI>Stew-house.</HI></P>
<P>No <HI>Stew-holder</HI> to keep any Woman, that hath the perilous Infirmity of
<HI>burning:</HI> nor to sell Bread, Ale, Flesh, Fish, Wood, Coale, or any Victu∣als,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>These allowed <HI>Stew-houses</HI> had Signs on their Fronts, towards the <HI>Thames,</HI>
not hanged out, but <HI>painted</HI> on the Walls, as a <HI>Boars</HI> head, the <HI>Crosse-Keys,</HI> the
<HI>Gun,</HI> the <HI>Castle,</HI> the <HI>Craue,</HI> the <HI>Cardinals Hat,</HI> the <HI>Bell,</HI> the <HI>Swan, &amp;c.</HI> Ancient
men of good credit do report, that these single Women were forbidden the
<HI>Rights of the Church</HI> so long as they continued that sinful life, and were exclu∣ded
from Christian burial, if they were not reconciled, before their death: And
therefore there was a plot of ground called the <HI>Single Womans Church-yard,</HI> ap∣pointed
for them, far from the Parish Church.</P>
<P>In the year of Christ, one thousand five hundred forty six, the seven and thir∣tieth
of <HI>Henry the</HI> eighth, this Row of <HI>Stews</HI> in <HI>Southwarke,</HI> was put down by
the Kings commandement, which was proclaimed by sound of Trumpet, no
more to be priviledg'd and used as a common Brothel.</P>
<P>Then next is the <HI>Clinke,</HI> a Goale or Prison for the Trespassers in those parts,
namely, in old time for such as should <HI>brabble, fray,</HI> or <HI>break</HI> the peace on the
said Bank, or in the <HI>Brothel</HI> Houses; they were by the Inhabitants thereabout,
apprehended and committed to this Gaole, where they were streightly im∣prisoned.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="91"/>
Next is the Bishop of <HI>Winchesters House,</HI> or Lodging when he com∣meth
to this City.</P>
<P>Adioyning to this on the South side thereof, is the <HI>Bishop of Rochesters Inne,</HI>
or lodging, by whom first erected, it is not upon Record; but 'tis known well,
the same of long time hath not been frequented by any Bishop, and lieth rui∣nous
for lack of reparations. The Abbot of <HI>Naverly</HI> had a House
there.</P>
<P>East from the Bishop of <HI>Winchesters</HI> House, directly over against it standeth a
fair Church, called St. <HI>Mary, over the Rie,</HI> or <HI>Overy,</HI> that is, over the water; This
Church, or some other in place thereof was (of old time long before the Con∣quest)
an House of Sisters, founded by a Maiden, named <HI>Mary,</HI> unto the which
House and Sisters they left (as was left to her by her Parents) the over-sight and
profits of a <HI>Crosse-Ferry</HI> or <HI>Traverse-Ferry</HI> over the <HI>Thames,</HI> there kept before
that any Bridge was builded; This House of Sisters was after by <HI>Swithin,</HI> a No∣ble
Lady, converted unto a Colledge of <HI>Priests</HI> who in place of the <HI>Ferry,</HI> buil∣ded
a Bridge of Timber, and from time to time kept the same in good repara∣tions;
But lastly the same Bridge was builded of Stone, and then in the year
1106, was this Church again founded for <HI>Canons Regular,</HI> by <HI>VVilliam Pont del
l' Arch,</HI> and <HI>VVilliam Daunly</HI> Knights <HI>Normans.</HI> This <HI>Peter de Rupibus</HI> or <HI>de la
Roch,</HI> founded a large Chappel of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> in the Church of St <HI>Ma∣ry
Overy,</HI> which Chappel was afterward appointed to be the Parish Church for
the Inhabitants near adjoyning. This Church was again new builded in the
Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth.</P>
<P><HI>Iohn Gower</HI> Esquire, a famous Poet, was then an especial Benefactor to that
work, and was there buried on the North side of the said Church, in the Chap∣pel
of St. <HI>Iohn,</HI> where he founded a Chantry; He lyeth under a Tombe of
Stone, with his Image also of Stone over him; The Hair of his Head <HI>auburne,</HI>
long to his Shoulders, but curling up and a small forked Beard: on his Head a
Chaplet, like a Coronet of four Roses, an habit of Purple damasked down to
his feet, a <HI>Collar of Esses of Gold</HI> about his Neck, under his Feet the likenesse of
three Books, which he compiled. The first named <HI>Speculum Meditantis,</HI> writ∣ten

Besides on the Wall where he lyeth, there was painted <HI>three Virgins Crowned,</HI>

<P>Now passing through St. <HI>Mary Overies Close</HI> (once in possession of the Lord
<HI>Montacute)</HI> &amp; <HI>Pepper Alley</HI> into <HI>Long Southwark;</HI> on the right hand thereof the
Market Hill, where the Leather is sold, there stood the late named Parish
Church of Saint <HI>Margaret,</HI> given to St. <HI>Mary Overies</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the first, put
down and joyned with the Parish Church of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and united
to the late dissolved <HI>Priory</HI> Church of St. <HI>Mary Overy.</HI></P>
<P>A part of this Parish Church of St. <HI>Margaret</HI> is now a <HI>Court</HI> wherein the
Assizes and Sessions be kept, and the Court of <HI>Admiralty</HI> is also there kept; one
other part of the same Church is now a prison, called the <HI>Compter</HI> in <HI>South∣warke,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Farther up on that side, almost directly over against St. <HI>Georges Church,</HI> was
sometime a large and most sumptuous house, builded by <HI>Charles Brandon,</HI> Duke
<PB N="339" REF="91"/>
of <HI>Suffolke,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, which was called <HI>Suffolk House,</HI>
but coming afterwards into the Kings hands, the same was called <HI>Southwark
place,</HI> and a <HI>Mint</HI> of Coynage was there kept for the King. Queen <HI>Mary</HI> give
this House to <HI>Nicholas Heth,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> and to his Successors for
ever, to be their Inne or Lodging for their repair to <HI>London,</HI> in recompence of
<HI>York House</HI> near to <HI>Westminster,</HI> which King <HI>Henry</HI> her Father had taken from
<HI>Cardinal Woolsey,</HI> and from the See of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>Then is the <HI>White Lion,</HI> a Goal so called, for that the same was a common Ho∣ftery
for the receit of Travellers by that Sign. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse was first used as a
Goal within these hundred years last, since the which time the prisoners were
once removed thence to an House in <HI>New-town,</HI> where they remained for a
short time, and were returned again to the aforesaid <HI>White Lion,</HI> there to remain
as the appointed Goal for the Countey of <HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<P>Next is the Goal or Prison of the <HI>Kings-Bench,</HI> but of what antiquity the
same is, it appears not. We read, that the Courts of the <HI>Kings-Bench</HI> and <HI>Chan∣cery,</HI>
have oft times been removed from <HI>London</HI> to other places, and so hath
likewise the other Goals that serve those Courts, as in the year 1304, <HI>Edward</HI> the
first commanded the Courts of <HI>Kings-Bench</HI> &amp; the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> which had remai∣ned
seven years at <HI>York,</HI> to be removed to their old places at <HI>London.</HI> And in the
year 1387, the eleaventh of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Robert Trisilian</HI> chief Justice,
came to the City of <HI>Coventry,</HI> and there sat by the space of a Month, as Justice of
the Kings Bench, and caused to be Indicted in that Court about the number of
2000 persons of that Country, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It seemeth therefore, that for that time the
Prison or Goale of that Court was not far off. Also, in the year 1392, the six∣teenth
of the same <HI>Richard,</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> being Lord Chancellor, for
good will that he bare to his City, caused the Kings Bench and Chancery to be
removed from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>York,</HI> but ere long they were returned to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Then is the <HI>Marshalsey</HI> another Goal or Prison, so called, as pertaining to the
<HI>Marshalls</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> of what continuance kept in <HI>Southwark,</HI> it appears not;
but likely it is, that the same hath been removeable, at the pleasure of the <HI>Mar∣shalls.</HI>
And then <HI>Thieves Lane</HI> by St. <HI>Thomas Hospital,</HI> first found by <HI>Richard,
Prior</HI> of <HI>Bermondsey,</HI> in the <HI>Cellerers</HI> grounded, against the Wall of the Mona∣stery,
in the year 1213, He named it the <HI>Almery,</HI> or house of Alms, for <HI>Converts</HI>
and poor Children.</P>
<P>In the year 1552, the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> having the void suppressed <HI>Hospital</HI>
of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> in the Month of <HI>Iuly,</HI> began the reparations there∣of,
for poor, impotent, lame, and diseased people, so that in the Month of <HI>No∣vember</HI>
next following, the sick and poor people were taken in,; And in the
year 1553, on the tenth of <HI>April,</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth in the seventh of his
Reign, gave to the Mayor, Communalty and Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> to be a Work-House
for the poor, and idle persons of the City, his House of <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and
seven hundred Marks Lands of the <HI>Savoy</HI> Rents, which Hospital he had suppres∣sed,
with all the Beds, bedding, and other furniture belonging to the same, to∣wards
the maintenance of the said Work-house of <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and of this Hospital
of Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>Southwark.</HI> This gift, the King confirmed by his Charter.
The Church of this Hospital, which of old time served for the Tenements neer
adjoyning and pertaining to the said Hospital, remaineth as a Parish Church.</P>
<P>But now to come to St. <HI>Olaves</HI> street: on the Bank of the River of Thames, is
the Parish Church of St. <HI>Olave,</HI> a fair and mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly large Church, but a far larger
Parish, especially of Aliens or strangers, and poor people.</P>
<P>Next is the Bridge-House, so called, as being a Store-house for Stone, Tim∣ber,
or whatsoever pertaining to the building or repairing of <HI>London</HI> Bridge.</P>
<P>This House seemeth to have taken beginning with the first founding of the
Bridge, either of Stone or Timber; it is a large plot of ground on the Bank of the
River of Thames, containing divers large buildings, for stowage of things ne∣cessary,
<PB N="340" REF="92"/>
towards reparation of the said Bridge. There are also divers <HI>Garners,</HI>
for laying up of <HI>Wheat,</HI> and other Granaries for service of the City, as need re∣quireth.
Moreover, there be certain Ovens builded, in number ten, of which
six be very large the other four being but half so big: these were purposely
made to bake out the Bread Corn of the said <HI>Grayners,</HI> to the best advantage, for
relief of the poor Cittizens, when need should require.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Battaile Bridge,</HI> so called of <HI>Battaile Abbey,</HI> for that it standeth on
the ground &amp; over a Water-course, (flowing out of Thames) pertaining to that
Abbey, and was therefore both builded and repaired by the <HI>Abbots</HI> of that
House, as being hard adjoyning to the Abbots Lodging.</P>
<P>Beyond this Bridge is <HI>Bermondsey</HI> street, turning South, in the South end
whereof was sometime a Priory or Abby of St. <HI>Saviour,</HI> called <HI>Bermonds Eye</HI>
in <HI>Southwarke,</HI> founded by <HI>Ailwin,</HI> a Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> in the year 1081.</P>
<P>In the year 1094, deceased <HI>Alwin,</HI> founder of this House. Then <HI>William
Rufus</HI> gave to the Monks, his Mannor of <HI>Bermondsey,</HI> with the appurtenances,
and builded there for them a new great Church.</P>
<P>In the year 1539. this <HI>Abbey</HI> was valued to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pend by the year, 474 <HI>l.</HI> four∣teen
shillings four pence half penny, and was surrendred to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth,
the one and thirtieth of his Reign, the Abbey Church was then pulled down by
Sir <HI>Thomas Pope</HI> Knight, and in place thereof, a goodly House builded of Stone
and Timber, since pertaining to the Earls of <HI>Sussex.</HI> Next unto this <HI>Abbey</HI>
Church standeth a proper Church of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> builded by the Priory
of <HI>Bermondsey,</HI> serving for resort of the Inhabitants (Tenants to the Priors or
Abbots near adjoyning) there to have their <HI>Divine Service;</HI> this Church re∣maineth
and serveth as afore, and is called a Parish Church. Then in <HI>Kent</HI>
street, is a <HI>Lazar</HI> House for <HI>Leprous people,</HI> called the <HI>Loke</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> the
foundation whereof is incertain.</P>
<P>This <HI>Borough</HI> at a subsidy to the King, was used to yield about a thousand
Marks, or eight hundred pounds, which is more than any one City in <HI>England</HI>
payeth except <HI>London;</HI> And also, the Muster of men in this Borough doth like∣wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
in number surpasse all other Cities, except <HI>London.</HI> And thus much for the
<HI>Borough</HI> of <HI>Southwarke,</HI> one of the six and twenty Wards of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus travers'd the whole Body of this great City, and her severall
Wards, from the Center to the Circumference; it is now to be observed, that
every Ward hath its particular Alderman as an Overseer, or Guardian assign'd
thereunto, who hath a greater latitude of power, than an ordinary Justice of
the Peace. This Alderman hath one <HI>Deputy,</HI> and in some Wards more. There
are likewise a number of <HI>Common-Councel men, Constables, men of the Wardmote
Inquest, Scavengers▪</HI> some more, some lesse, with <HI>Beadles</HI> in every Ward. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
last Ward which is the Borough of <HI>Southwark,</HI> differs from the rest in this, that
the Alderman appointed there, hath three Deputies and a Bayliff, but no Com∣mon
Councel men.</P>

<P>The second of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the Forrest of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> and the Warren of
<HI>Stanes,</HI> were difafforested; since which time, the Suburbs also about <HI>London,</HI>
in tract of time, and, as it were, by an insensible augmentation, have wonder∣fully
increased in people and edifices.</P>
<P>Near the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> is the Hospital of St. <HI>Katherine</HI> (spoken of before)
founded by <HI>Matilda,</HI> Wife to King <HI>Stephen,</HI> that renowned and most Religious
Queen.</P>
<P>From the Liberties of St. <HI>Katherine</HI> to <HI>Wapping,</HI> the usual place of Execution

of man, there was never a House standing, but the Gallowes which was
further removed, in regard of the Buildings. But now there is a continued
street towards a mile long, from the Tower, all along the River, almost as far as
<HI>Radcliffe,</HI> which proceeded from the encrease of Navigation, Mariners and Tra∣fique.</P>
<P><HI>The Citizens of</HI> London, <HI>were the chief Benefactors, towards the erecting of
the new Church at</HI> Wapping, <HI>a Chappel of ease to</HI> White-Chappel: <HI>And upon a

This Chappel was dedicated to Almighty God, and consecrated to the Honour and
glory of his great and wonderful name, the seventh day of <HI>July,</HI> 1617. by the right

<P>Without <HI>Algate</HI> there is a spacious huge Suburb, about a mile long, as far as
<HI>White Chappel,</HI> and further: <HI>White Chappel</HI> was as it were, a Chappel of Ease to
<HI>Stebunhith,</HI> now called by a strange contraction, <HI>Stepney</HI> Parish: the Church of
<HI>White Chappel,</HI> was called St. <HI>Mary Marfelon,</HI> because a <HI>Frenchman</HI> having ser∣ved
a rich Widow hard by and murthered her for her Wealth, the Women and
Boyes stoned the Felon to death, as he thought to fly away.</P>
<P>From <HI>Algate▪</HI> North-West to <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> lyeth <HI>Houndsditch,</HI> a long street,
then is the fair Parish Church of St. <HI>Buttolph:</HI> Then is the Hospital of St. <HI>Mary</HI>
of <HI>Bethlem,</HI> founded by a <HI>London</HI> Citizen, as hath bin shewn before; without

<P>Then is there in this Suburb, the Hospital of St. <HI>Mary</HI> Spittle, and a great
Palace, called <HI>Fishers Folly,</HI> built by the Lord <HI>Iohn Powlet.</HI></P>
<P>In former times, there was in <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> a Row of small Almshon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, built

Arch-Deacon of <HI>Pauls de jure,</HI> is alwayes Parson; We are come now to <HI>Moor∣fields,</HI>
which in former times, was but a fenny quagge, or Moore, and is now, by

<P><HI>Aldersgate</HI> Suburb is next, where the Parish of St. <HI>Buttolph</HI> stands, and little

handsome Edifices, and a large street, as far as <HI>Barbican,</HI> on the one side, and
<HI>Long-lane</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>This street resembleth an <HI>Italian</HI> street, more then any other in <HI>London,</HI> by
reason of the spaciousness &amp; uniformity of Buildings, and streightness thereof,
with the convenient distance of the Houses; on both sides whereof, there are
divers very fair ones, as <HI>Peter-House,</HI> the Palace now, and Mansion of the most
Noble <HI>Marquis of Dorchester:</HI> Then is there the Earl of <HI>Tenets</HI> House, with the
Moon and Sun-Tavern, very fair structures, Then is there from about the middle
of <HI>Aldersgate-street,</HI> a handsome new street butted out, and fairly built by the
Company of <HI>Goldsmiths,</HI> which reacheth athwart as far as <HI>Redcrosse-street.</HI></P>
<P>At the furthest point of this Suburb Northward, there was a Winde-Mill in
times past, which being blown down by a Tempest, Queen <HI>Katherine</HI> of <HI>Ara∣gon,</HI>
first Wife to <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> erected there a Chappel, and named it Mount
<HI>Calvary,</HI> which was afterwards suppressed, and the place came to be called

<P>We are going now to <HI>Newgate,</HI> where towards <HI>Smithfield,</HI> I meet with <HI>Gilt∣spur,</HI>

<P>This demolish'd <HI>Charter-House,</HI> came a while after, to the possession of <HI>Tho∣mas
Earl of Suffolk,</HI> Lord Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> in King <HI>James</HI> his Raign, and
the place being sweetly scituated, with accommodations of spacious Walks,
Orchards, and Gardens, with sundry dependencies of Tenements, and Lands
thereunto belonging, gave occasion to that worthy and well disposed Gentle∣man,
Mr. <HI>Thomas Sutton,</HI> of <HI>Cast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> Camps, in the County of <HI>Cambridge</HI> Esquire,

the Conveyance; which charitable, great, and noble enterprize, was counte∣nanced
by King <HI>James,</HI> and his privy Councel.</P>
<P>So having in few years raised up that goodly Fabrique, (though it pleased God
to take him to himself, before it was quite finish'd) and endowed it with com∣petent
allowance, by passing away many goodly Mannors, he had in <HI>Lincoln,
Wiltshire, Middlesex, Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> with other goodly possessions, the
work was compleated, and nominated the Hospital of King <HI>James;</HI> which
Hospital, consisted of a Master, a Governor, a Preacher, a Free School, with a
Master and Usher, 80. poor people, and 40. Schollers, maintained all by the
Revenues of the House, <HI>Anno</HI> 1614. on <HI>Munday</HI> next, after <HI>Michaelmas</HI> day, the
Captains, Gentlemen, and Officers, entred into this new Hospital.</P>
<P>Now there were by Letters Pattents under the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> di∣vers
Governors appointed of this Hospital, whereof the Arch Bishop of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI>
was chief, The Lord <HI>Chancelor,</HI> and <HI>Treasurer,</HI> The Bishops of <HI>London</HI>
and <HI>Ely,</HI> the Lord Chief Justice of the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> the <HI>Attorney General,</HI> the
<HI>Dean of Pauls,</HI> the <HI>Dean of Westminster,</HI> and divers others; But the late long
Parliament, inverting the order and will of the founder, did nominate others in
their rooms.</P>
<P>A little without the Barres of <HI>West Smithfield▪</HI> is <HI>Charter-house Lane;</HI> but in
the large yard before, there are many handsome Palaces, as <HI>Rutland</HI> House, and
one where the <HI>Venetian</HI> Embassadors were used to lodge; which yard hath lately
bin conveniently raised, and made more neat and comely.</P>
<P>Then is there St. <HI>Johns street,</HI> with <HI>Turnmill-street,</HI> which stretcheth up West,
to <HI>Clarken-well,</HI> and it is vulgarly called <HI>Turnball-street:</HI> There is another Lane
called St. <HI>Peters</HI> Lane, which turns from St. <HI>Johns street,</HI> to <HI>Cow-Crosse.</HI></P>
<P>The dissolved Priory of St. <HI>John of Jerusalem,</HI> stood on the left hand, foun∣ded
almost 600. years since, by <HI>Jorden Briset,</HI> a pious brave man, who had foun∣ded

<P>The Rebels and Rabble of <HI>Kent,</HI> did much mischief to this House 1381. set∣ting
it on fire, and letting it burn seven dayes: At the suppression of Abbeys,
this House among the rest, felt the fury of fare; yet it was not quite demolish∣ed,
but employed as a <HI>Store-house</HI> for the Kings toyles and tents, as well for
hunting▪ as for the Warres. But in <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth's time, that goodly Church
for the most part, I mean the body and side Iles, with the great <HI>Bell-Tower,</HI> a
most curious peece of fabrick, being engraven, gilt, and enamel'd, to the great
Ornament of City and Suburb, was barbarously undermined, and blown up
with Gunpowder: the stones whereof were carried to finish the then <HI>Pro∣tectors</HI>

Cardinal <HI>Pool,</HI> in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> Raign, closed up again part of the Quire,

but thinking to bring the place to its first principles, it was suppressed again by
Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> A great number of Knights of that Order, had Monuments
in that Church.</P>
<P>North from the said House of St. <HI>John's,</HI> was the Priory of <HI>Clarken-Well,</HI> which

thither, you passe by the Bishop of <HI>Elies</HI> great Palace, and <HI>Hatton-House,</HI> and
<HI>Brook-House:</HI> beyond the Barres, there is <HI>Postpool-lane,</HI> and <HI>Grayes Inne
Lane.</HI></P>
<P>Southward of this Lane, there is a row of small Houses, which is a mighty
hindrance to <HI>Holborn,</HI> in point of prospect, which if they were taken down,
there would be from <HI>Holborn</HI> Conduit, to St. <HI>Giles</HI> in the field, one of the fair∣est
rising street in the World.</P>
<P>From <HI>Newgate</HI> on the left hand, lyeth the <HI>Old Bayley;</HI> and so down by <HI>Sea∣cole</HI>
and <HI>Fleet-lane,</HI> we passe then over the common Sewer, up to <HI>Shooe-lane</HI> and
so to <HI>Fewter-lane,</HI> now vulgarly called <HI>Fetter-lane;</HI> but betwixt these two Lanes,
there is another new street, butted out by the Company of <HI>Goldsmiths,</HI> called
<HI>Newstreet,</HI> where there is a knot of very handsome Buildings.</P>
<P>Above the Barres, there was a House of the <HI>Templers,</HI> but they removed
thence to <HI>Fleetstreet:</HI> There was also adjoyning thereunto, the Bishop of <HI>Lin∣colns</HI>
House, which was very ancient; for the Records say, 'twas built <HI>Anno
1147.</HI> But of late years, it hath belonged to the Noble Earls of <HI>Southhampton;</HI>
And lately, it hath bin quite taken down, and turned to several private Tene∣ments,
as <HI>Durham</HI> House is in the Strand. Insomuch, that if one should ask,
what God Almighty doth now in <HI>London,</HI> he might (as the pulse of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
beats) give the same answer that was given by the Pagan Philosopher, who be∣ing
demanded what <HI>Iupiter</HI> did in Heaven, he said, <HI>Magnas ollas rump<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, &amp; ex
frustis earum parvas componit, Jupiter</HI> breaks great Vessels, and makes small
ones of their peeces.</P>
<P>Side long of this ancient House of the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> is <HI>Newstreet,</HI> for so
it was called at first; but now 'tis called <HI>Chancery-lane,</HI> where <HI>Edward</HI> the third
annexed the House of converted Jews, to the Office of <HI>Custos Rotulorum.</HI></P>
<P>Here the <HI>Cursitors</HI> Office was built by Sir <HI>Nicholas Bacon,</HI> Lord Keeper of the
great Seal.</P>
<P>Here also is the six Clarks Office, which is a fair convenient peece of stone
and Brick Building newly erected, the old being consumed by a casual fire of
late years. The Bishop of <HI>Chicester, Ralph Nevil,</HI> had much ground given him
thereabouts, by <HI>Henry</HI> the third, which now is become all Tenements, thick
built, and quite alienated.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Lincolns Inne,</HI> very much encreased in building, it appertained
sometimes to the said <HI>Ralph Nevil,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Chicester,</HI> Lord Chancellor of
<HI>England,</HI> having bin before the House of the <HI>Black-Fryers:</HI> and after the decease
of the said Bishop <HI>Nevil, Henry Lacy</HI> Earl of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> Constable of <HI>Chester▪</HI> and
<HI>Custos</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> added much building to this place; and Sir <HI>Thomas Lovel</HI> did
also add much thereunto, in <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth's time; but now it is one of the
foure Inns of Court, for the Students in the Law.</P>
<P>Behind <HI>Lincolns Inne</HI> Westward, is a spacious field, where many fair Houses,
or rather Palaces, are taken up by the Gentry. Then is there towards <HI>Drewry</HI>
Lane, a new Market, called <HI>Clare</HI> Market; then is there a street, and Palace of
<PB N="345" REF="94"/>
the same name, built by the Earl of <HI>Clare,</HI> who lives there in a princely manner,
having a House, a street, and a Market, both for flesh and fish, all bearing his
name.</P>
<P>There was something omitted which should have bin spoken of the Church
of St. <HI>Giles</HI> of the Field, which is, that being a very ancient Church, and so de∣cayed,
that it could not be repaired, a new one was erected, partly out of the
ruines of the old; which work was begun and finished in two years; and a while
after, the fair Brick Wall that encompasseth it. There were divers well dispo∣sed
persons, who contributed to so pious a work; but specially the Lady <HI>Alice
Duddeley,</HI> according to that which is engraven upon the North door, in pure and
ponderous Latine, which I thought therefore worthy to be here inserted.

<P>From the North end of <HI>Chancery</HI> Lane, is <HI>High Holborn,</HI> which extends up
to St. <HI>Giles</HI> in the Field, where the famous devout Queen <HI>Matilda</HI> did found
an Hospital, as she did Eastward St. <HI>Katherines</HI> beyond the Tower. At this Ho∣spital
the Prisoners conveyed from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Tyborn,</HI> were used to be presented
with a <HI>Bowl of Ale,</HI> for their last refreshment in this life, and it was commonly
called St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s <HI>Bowl:</HI> Then is there a spacious fair street, called <HI>Long Acre,</HI>
and then <HI>Pickadilly,</HI> full of fair Houses round about.</P>
<P>Thus have we as succinctly as we could, avoiding superfluities, and unneces∣sary
trivial things, spoken of the Skirts of <HI>London,</HI> and the places thereunto an∣nexed,
without the Gates, and now,

<P>HAving taken so fair a Prospect, and finished the perlustration of <HI>London.</HI> It
were a high Incivility, and a soloecism in good manners (or rather a <HI>Pi∣acle)</HI>
not to give <HI>VVestminster</HI> also a visit, being so near and contiguous a
Neighborr: It is true, that they were once above a mile asunder; but by in∣sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
coalition and recruit of people, they came at last to be united, and in∣corporated
into one continued peece, in point of posture, though not of Go∣vernment.
And the Union with <HI>Scotland,</HI> did not a little conduce, to make this
Union <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>twixt <HI>London</HI> and <HI>VVestminster▪</HI> For the <HI>Scots</HI> multiplying here mighti∣ly,
neas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed themse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves about the Court, so that the <HI>Strand,</HI> from mud Walls,
and thatched Houses, came to that perfection of Buildings, as now
we see.</P>
<P>Moreover, the City of <HI>VVestminster</HI> hath divers <HI>Magnalia's,</HI> which may de∣serve
as exact a view as any within <HI>London;</HI> for if <HI>London</HI> of old had her Temple
of <HI>Diana, VVestm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nster</HI> had one to a greater Deity, which was <HI>Apollo;</HI> And
since, (in those very places); is St. <HI>Paul,</HI> hath his Church in <HI>London:</HI> St. <HI>Peter,</HI>
the Prince of the Apostles, hath his in <HI>VVestminster,</HI> which was used to keep the
<HI>Regalia's</HI> and the Crown.</P>
<P>Add hereunto, that if <HI>London</HI> hath her <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> and the <HI>Hustings.
VVestminster</HI> hath the great <HI>Praetorian,</HI> or common Hall, where the chief
Courts, and general Tribunals of Justice, do make their Sessions, though to her
high pray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e be it spoken, <HI>London</HI> hath a far more expedite way of doing Justice,
and determination of cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es then <HI>Westminster</HI> hath; besides, in point of safety
and strength, if <HI>London</HI> hath her <HI>Artillery</HI> Garden, <HI>Westminster</HI> hath her <HI>Mili∣tary:</HI>
And in point of Extent and Government, if <HI>London</HI> hath her six and
twenty Wards, and so many Aldermen; <HI>Westminster</HI> also hath her <HI>Twelve Bur∣gesses,</HI>
and so many distinct Wards; but for the quality of Inhabitants, <HI>London</HI>
mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t vayl to her; most of the Nobility and Gentry residing in, or about her
Precincts.</P>
<P>Moreover, in one particular, <HI>Westminster</HI> may claim a great advantage of
<HI>London</HI> in regard as the <HI>Royal Court</HI> once was, so the residence of the Soveraign
Magistrate is still there: Insomuch, that <HI>Westminster</HI> may well glory of three
things, That she hath the chiefest Courts of Justice, the chiefest Court of the
Prince, and the chiefest Court of the <HI>King of Heaven</HI> (for every Temple is his
Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and Court.) Now the Abbey of <HI>Westminster,</HI> hath bin alwayes held the
greatest Sanctuary, and randevouze of devotion of the whole Iland: w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereunto,
the scituation of the very place, seemes to contribute much, and to strike a ho∣ly
kind of Reverence and sweetness of melting piety in the hearts of the be∣ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ders.</P>
<P>But before we steer our course to <HI>Westminster,</HI> we must visit the <HI>Dutchy</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Lancaster,</HI> and the <HI>Savoy,</HI> which are liberties of themselves, and lie (as a Paren∣thesis)
'twixt <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>Without <HI>Temple-barre</HI> Westward, is a liberty pertaining to the Dutchy of
<HI>Lancaster,</HI> which beginneth on the North side of the <HI>Thames,</HI> and stretcheth
West to <HI>Ivy-bridge,</HI> where it terminates.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="95"/>
And again, on the North side, some small distance without Temple-Barre,
in the High street, there stretcheth one large middle row, or troop of small Te∣nements,
partly opening to the South, and partly towards the North, up West
to a Stone Crosse, over against the <HI>Strand;</HI> and this is the bounds of the liber∣ty,
which first belonged to <HI>Brian Lisle,</HI> after to <HI>Peter of Savoy,</HI> and then to the
House of <HI>Lancaster.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the third did grant to his Uncle <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> all those Houses upon
the Thames, which pertained to <HI>Brian Lisle,</HI> or <HI>de Insula,</HI> in the way, or the
street, called the <HI>Strand,</HI> to hold to him and his Heires, yielding three gilded
Arrowes, every year in the Exchequer.</P>
<P>This <HI>Peter,</HI> Earl of <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Richmond,</HI> Son to <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Savoy,</HI> Bro∣ther
to <HI>Boniface</HI> Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and Uncle unto <HI>Eleanor</HI> Wife to
<HI>Henry</HI> the third, was the first Founder of the <HI>Savoy, Anno</HI> 1245. which he gave
afterwards to the Fraternity of <HI>Monjoy.</HI> Queen <HI>Eleanor</HI> did purchase it for <HI>Ed∣mund</HI>
Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> her Son, of the Fraternity; which Duke did much
augment and improve the structure. <HI>Iohn</HI> the French King was lodged there,
being then the fairest Mannor of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1381. The Rebels of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> did most barbarously burn this
House, with many Vessels of Gold and Silver, which they threw into the River;
all which they did out of a popular malice to <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster.</HI>
It came afterwards to the Kings hands, and <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh did re-edifie and
raise it up again, but converted it to the Hospital of St. <HI>Iohn Baptist;</HI> yet was
he content, that it should be still called the <HI>Savoy,</HI> and bestowed Lands, for
maintenance of 100. poor men; But afterwards, it was suppressed by his
Granchild, <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth: the Beds, and Bedding, with other Furniture,
were given to the City of <HI>London;</HI> together, with <HI>Bridewell,</HI> to be a Work-house
for idle persons; and some of <HI>Savoy</HI> Furniture was given also to furnish
St. <HI>Thomas</HI> Hospital in <HI>Southwark:</HI> But afterwards, the <HI>Savoy</HI> Hospital was re∣founded,
and endowed with Lands, by Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> who made one <HI>Iackson,</HI>
first Master thereof) And it is memorable, how the Mayds of Honour, and
Ladies of the Court, in those times, did much contribute for storing it again
with new Beds, and Furniture; and so it hath continued ever since: the Chap∣pel
of this Hospital serving for a Parish Church, to the Neighbors thereof near
adjoyning, and others.</P>
<P>Now touching the Prerogatives, and enfranchisements of the Dutchy of
<HI>Lancaster,</HI> let the Reader know, that <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, by his Royal Charter,
and concurrence of Parliament, did sever the possessions of the said <HI>Dutchy</HI>
from the Crown, And that which <HI>Iohn of Gaunt</HI> held for term of life, was esta∣blished
to perpetuity, by the Statutes of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the se∣venth:
which separation was made by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in regard he well
knew, that he had the Dutchy o <HI>Lancaster (par Regno)</HI> by sure and indefesble
Title, whereas his Title to the Crown was not so assured, because that after the
death of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, the Royal right was in the Heir of <HI>Lionel,</HI> Duke of
<HI>Clarence,</HI> second Son of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. And <HI>John of Gaunt,</HI> who was Father
to <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, was the fourth Son: therefore his policy was, to make it
a distinct thing from the Crown, for fear of after-claps.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Edward</HI> the third, who erected the County of <HI>Lancaster</HI> to a County
Palatine, and honoured the Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> therewith, giving him <HI>Jura Re∣galia,</HI>
having a particular Court, The Officers whereof, were the <HI>Chancellor,</HI>
the <HI>Attorney,</HI> the <HI>Receiver General, Clark of the Court,</HI> the <HI>Auditors, Surveyors,</HI>
the <HI>Messenger;</HI> The Seal of the <HI>Dutchy of Lancaster</HI> remains with the <HI>Chancel∣lor;</HI>
but the Seal of the <HI>County Palatine,</HI> remains alwayes in a Chest, in the
<HI>County Palatine</HI> under the safe custody of a Keeper.</P>
<P>Now, all Grants and Leases of Lands, Tenements, and Offices in the <HI>Coun∣ty
Palatine</HI> of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> should passe under that Seal, and no other; but all
<PB N="348" REF="96"/>
Grants and Leases out of the <HI>County Palatine,</HI> and within the Survey of the
Dutchy, should passe under the Seal of the Dutchy, and no other; otherwise
such Grants are voyd, <HI>Ipso facto.</HI> Though this <HI>County Palatine</HI> was a younger
Brother, yet it had more honours mannors, and Lands annexed unto it, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
any of the rest; and all this by Acts of Parliament, whereby all the Franchises,
Priviledges, Immunities, Quittances and Freedoms, which the Duke of <HI>Lan∣caster</HI>
had for Himself and his Men, and Tenants, were confirmed.</P>
<P>The Liberty of the Dutchy was used to be governed by the Chancellor, who
had under him a Steward, that kept Court Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, with an Attorney of the Dutchy.
There were also four Burgesses, and four Assistants, a Bayliffe, who had others
under him▪ four Constables, four Wardens, that kept the stock for the poor, four
Wardens for high wayes, a Jury of 14. Ale-cunners, which looked to the
assise of measures, four Scavengers, and a Beadle, and the common Prison is
<HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>And now we must make a step back towards <HI>Temple-barre,</HI> and so by degrees,
to <HI>Westminster</HI> all along, we will begin with the right hand, or the Northside,
and so pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e up West, through a back lane or street, wherein do stand (as was
touched before) three Inns of <HI>Chancery▪</HI> The first called <HI>Clements Inne,</HI> in regard
it is near St. <HI>Clements Church,</HI> and <HI>Clements Well.</HI> The second <HI>New Inne,</HI> which
was made of a common Hostery, about the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> 7.
The third is <HI>Lions Inne.</HI> This street stretcheth up unto <HI>Drury</HI> lane, which lane
extends Northward towards St. <HI>Giles</HI> in the Field. But now we must go back, as
was said before, towards <HI>Temple-barre.</HI> and so by taking the <HI>Strand,</HI> all along
return by degrees to <HI>Westminster</HI> it self, in a direct line.</P>
<P>I have heard often of a British Prophecy, which came from an old <HI>Bard,</HI> viz.
The Church man was, the Lawyer is, and the Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ier shall be. True it is, that
Bishops lived in the Equipage of Princes, in former times; and among other
in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, one is, the goodly Palaces they had in and about <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>West∣minster;</HI>
for from <HI>Dorset</HI> House in <HI>Fleetstreet,</HI> as far as <HI>White-hall,</HI> all the great
Houses, which were built upon the Banks of the Thames, were all Episcopal
Palaces, except the <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Suffolk-house.</HI> The first for greatness was <HI>Excester</HI>
House (now called <HI>Essex)</HI> whereof the chiefest Founder was <HI>Edward Stapleton,</HI>
Bishop of that See, who was beheaded by the <HI>Londoners</HI> in <HI>Cheap-side,</HI> and his
Body was then brought, and buried in a heap of Sand or rubbish, in his own
House near <HI>Temple-barre,</HI> in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Edmond L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey,</HI> built the great Hall in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth.
The same was since called <HI>Paget-House,</HI> being enlarged by <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Paget.</HI>
Then was it called <HI>Leicester-House,</HI> of <HI>Robert Dudley,</HI> who was the great Favo∣rite
to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it came to be called <HI>Essex-house,</HI> from <HI>Robert</HI>
Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who was also a Favorite of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and beheaded in the
Tower.</P>
<P>Opposite to this House, standeth the Parish-Church of Saint <HI>Clement
Danes,</HI> so called, because <HI>Harold,</HI> a <HI>Danish</HI> King, with other of that Nation,
were buried there.</P>
<P>Then was the Bishop of <HI>Baths Inne,</HI> or City-House, builded by the Lord
<HI>Thomas Seamer,</HI> Admiral of <HI>England:</HI> which House, came afterwards to be
possessed by the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> &amp; so it beares the name of <HI>Arundel-house:</HI> neer
there adjoyning, there was once a Parish-Church, called the <HI>Nativity of our
Lady,</HI> or the <HI>Innocents of the Strand,</HI> with a fair Coemitery, or Church-yard,
wherein there was a Brother-hood kept, called Saint <HI>Vrsula</HI> of the
<HI>Strand.</HI></P>
<P>Near adjoyning to the said Church, betwixt it and the Thames, there was an
Inne of <HI>Chancery,</HI> called <HI>Chesters Inne,</HI> because it belonged to the Bishop of
<HI>Chester,</HI> and sometimes 'twas called <HI>Strand</HI> Inne.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="96"/>
Then was there a House belonging to the Bishop of <HI>Landaff,</HI> which one of
those Bishops purchased of the Duke of <HI>Lancaster.</HI></P>
<P>Then was there the Bishop of <HI>Chesters</HI> Inne or Palace, which was first built
by <HI>Walter Langhton,</HI> Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first.
And not far from that was the Bishop of <HI>Worcesters</HI> Inne or Palace; All which
<HI>viz.</HI> The Parish Church called Saint <HI>Mary</HI> of the <HI>Strand, Strand Inne,</HI> with
the Bishop of <HI>Chester,</HI> and Bishop of <HI>Worcesters</HI> Houses, with all the Tenements
adjoyning, were by commandement of <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> Uncle to <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the sixth, &amp; Lord Protector pull'd down, and laid level to the ground <HI>An∣no
1549.</HI> In place whereof, he erected that large and goodly House, call'd now
<HI>Somerset House,</HI> which rose out of the ruines of the Church; Therefore the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Catholiques observed, that an apparent judgement from Heaven fell upon
him afterwards, being beheaded a little after; and he and his Counsel were so
infatuated, that he forgot to call for his Clergy, which he might have claimed
by the Law, and so sav'd his life.</P>
<P>Then is there <HI>Bedford</HI> House, which was sometimes the Bishop of <HI>Carliles</HI>
Inne. It stretched from the <HI>Savoy</HI> to <HI>Ivie</HI> Bridge, where Sir <HI>Robert Cecill</HI> Earl
of <HI>Salisbury</HI> raysed a large and stately House of Brick and Timber; <HI>Worcester</HI>
House lies sideling of it, and there being a great <HI>VValnut</HI> tree there growing,
which much hindred the prospect of <HI>Salisbury</HI> House Eastward, the Earl bargai∣ned
with one of the Lord <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>VVorcesters</HI> servants, that if he could get
leave of his Lord
to cut down that Tree, he would give him 100 <HI>li,</HI> the servanc
told his Lord of it, who bad him fell down the Tree and take the money; but
the old Earl (there being no good correspondence 'twixt <HI>Salisbury</HI> and him)
caused presently a new Brick building to be there erected, where the Tree
stood.</P>
<P>We come now to <HI>Durham</HI> House, built by <HI>Thomas Hatfield</HI> Bishop of that
<HI>See,</HI> a very capacious Edifice, on the North side whereof stood a row of thatch'd
Stables, which the Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> purchased, and pull'd down, and erected
in place thereof, the <HI>New Exchange,</HI> or <HI>Britains Burse;</HI> which was built with
wonderful celerity, for the first Stone thereof was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayed on the tenth of <HI>Iune
1608,</HI> and it was fully finished the <HI>November</HI> next following. The Earl did then
invite King <HI>Iames</HI> with the Queen, to see his new House, where after a rich
banquet the King named the place <HI>Britains Burse.</HI></P>
<P>Next beyond <HI>Durham</HI> House and this new building, is another great Palace,
belonging of old to the Bishop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> but afterwards it came to the Arch∣bishop
of <HI>Yorke,</HI> by this occasion. When Cardinal <HI>Woolsey,</HI> Arch Bishop
of <HI>Yorke,</HI> was Indicted in a <HI>premunire,</HI> whereby the King was entitled
to all his Goods and Possessions, he among other things, seazed upon the said
Cardinals House, where he then dwelled, commonly called <HI>York Place,</HI> and
changed the name thereof to <HI>White-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>The Arch-bishops of <HI>York,</HI> having then no House in <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Westminster,</HI>
Queen <HI>Mary</HI> gave unto <HI>Nicholas Heath</HI> then Arch-bishop of <HI>Yorke, Suffolke</HI>
House in <HI>Southwark,</HI> lately built by <HI>Charles Brandon;</HI> which House the said
Arch-bishop sold, and in lieu thereof he purchased the Bishop of <HI>Norwich's</HI>
House, which ever since hath been called <HI>Yorke</HI> House, though it came after∣wards
to the possession of the Duke of Buckingham <HI>George Villers,</HI> who added
much to the old Edifice, and would have had it called <HI>Buckingham</HI> House, which
name is engraven upon the watergate in great Letters.</P>
<P>There was of old, an Hospitall of St. <HI>Mary Rouncival</HI> (an order which came
from <HI>Navarre</HI> in <HI>Spain)</HI> by <HI>Charing-Crosse,</HI> where a Fraternity was founded
in the fifteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, which was afterwards suppressed and tur∣ned
to Tenements. Near unto this Hospital was an <HI>Hermitage</HI> with a Chap∣pel
of St. <HI>Katherine</HI> over against <HI>Charing-Crosse,</HI> which Crosse was erected by
<HI>Edward</HI> the first to the honor of his Queen (as is spoken else-where) <HI>Eleanor,</HI> and

<P>West of this Crosse stood sometimes another Hospital called St. <HI>Iames,</HI> con∣sisting

then were there added eight Brethren, to minister Divine Service there. After∣wards,
there was a great addition of Land made to this Hospital, and <HI>Edward</HI>

<P>This Hospital being surrendred to <HI>Henry</HI> 8. the Sisters were allowed Pensi∣ons
during their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and the King erected there a Mannor House, with a Park

Northward towards <HI>Westminster,</HI> we must make a slep backward to Saint
<HI>Martins</HI> Church and Lane, where on the West side there are many gentile fair
Houses in a row built by the same Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> who built <HI>Britains Burse,</HI> but
somewhat before. Then have we <HI>Bedford Berry,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Coven

<P>And now we are come to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> belonging of old to <HI>Hubert de Burgh,</HI>
Earl of <HI>Kent▪</HI> and <HI>Iusticier</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> who gave it to the <HI>Black-Fryers</HI> in
<HI>Holborne;</HI> but being fallen to <HI>Henry</HI> the 8. ordained it to be called an <HI>Honor,</HI>
and built there a huge long Gallery, with two Gate-houses thwart the street to
St. <HI>Iames</HI> Park.</P>
<P>From these Gates we passe in a direct Line to Kings street; on one side where∣of
passing through St. <HI>Stephen</HI> Alley is <HI>Canon Row,</HI> (but now though very cor∣ruptly

of Saint <HI>Stephens</HI> Chappel, who were lodg'd there, but now they are all turn'd
to be temporal habitations.</P>

<P>On the South side of these Gates, <HI>Henry</HI> the the seventh founded an Alms-House
for 13 poor men; one of them to be a Priest, and above 45 years old, the
rest to be aged 50 years without Wives.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="97"/>
Near to this place, was of old, the Chappel of St. <HI>Anne,</HI> where the Lady
<HI>Margaret Henry</HI> the sevenths Mother, erected an Alms-House for poor women
and it was called <HI>Eleemosynary,</HI> and now <HI>Almory,</HI> or <HI>Ambry,</HI> because the Alms of
the Abbey were there distributed to the poor: And there <HI>Islp</HI> Abbot of <HI>VVestmin∣ster</HI>
set up the first Press of Book-printing that ever was in <HI>England, Anno</HI> 1471.
And one <HI>Caxton</HI> Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> was the first who brought over that
Art.</P>
<P>Then is there <HI>Totehill</HI> street, where there are of late years sundry fair Houses
on the back of St. <HI>Iames</HI> Park. The Lady <HI>Anne Dacre</HI> built there an Hosp∣tall
for twenty poor Women, and so many Children to be brought up under
them.</P>
<P>Then is there <HI>Petty France,</HI> where, upon a place called St. <HI>Hermits</HI> Hill, <HI>Cornelius

Women to dwell Rent-free. And near hereunto there was of old a Chappel of
St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> which is now quite ruinated.</P>
<P>There is of late years a new large Chappel of Brick erected there, at the en∣trance

<P>And now we will return to the <HI>Abbey</HI> of <HI>VVestminster,</HI> a place which was us'd
to be of very high devotion; It gives the denomination to the whole City, and

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Westminster Abbey.</HEAD>
<P>THis Church is famous, especially by reason of the <HI>inauguration</HI> and <HI>se∣pulture</HI>
of the Kings of <HI>England. Sulcard</HI> writeth, that there stood
sometimes a Temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> in that place, and that in the daies
of <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Rome,</HI> it fell down with an Earth∣quake;
out of the remains whereof, <HI>Sebert</HI> King of the <HI>East-Saxons,</HI> erected ano∣ther
to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> which being by the <HI>Danes</HI> overthrown, Bishop <HI>Dunstane</HI> re-e∣dified,
and granted it to some few Monks. But afterwards King <HI>Edward</HI> surna∣med
the <HI>Confessour,</HI> with the tenth penny of all his Revenues, built it a new for
to be his own Sepulture, and a Monastery for <HI>Benedictine</HI> Monks, endowing it
with Livings and Lands, lying dispersed in divers parts of <HI>England.</HI> But listen
what an Historian saith, who then lived. <Q>The devout King destined unto
God that place, both for that it was near unto the famous and wealthy City
of <HI>London,</HI> and also had a pleasant scituation amongst fruitful fields, and green
grounds, lying round about it, with the principal River running hard by,
bringing in from all parts of the World, great variety of Wares; and Merchan∣dize
of all sorts to the City adjoyning; But chiefly for the love of the <HI>Chief
Apostle,</HI> whom he reverenced with a special and singular affection. He made
choice to have a place there for his own Sepulchre: and thereupon comman∣ded,
that of the Tenths of all his Rents, the work of a noble Edifice should be
taken in hand, such as might beseem the <HI>Prince</HI> of the Apostles: To the end (as
the <HI>Annales</HI> have it) that he might procure the propitious favour of the Lord,
after he should finish the course of this transitory life, both in regard of his de∣vout
Piety, and also of his free Oblation of Lands and Ornaments, wherewith
he purposed to endow, and enrich the same. According therefore to the Kings
<PB N="354" REF="98"/>
commandement the work was nobly began, and happily proceeded forward:
neither the charges already disbursed, or to be disbursed, were weighed
and regarded, so that it might be presented in the end unto God and Saint
<HI>Peter,</HI> and made worth their acceptation. Thus the words of the old Record
run.</Q></P>
<P>Touching the Form of that ancient building, we read in an old Manuscript
Book, that the principal plot or ground-work of the building was supported
with most lofty Arches, cast round with a four square work, and semblable
joynts. But the compasse of the whole, with a do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Arch of Stone on both
sides is enclosed with joyned-work, firmly knit and united together, every way.
Moreouer, the Crosse of the Church which was to compasse the mid Quire of
those that chaunted unto the Lord, and with a twofold supportance, that it had
on either side to uphold and bear the lofty top of the Tower in the midst, sim∣ply
riseth at first with a low and strong Arch; then mounteth it higher, with
many winding stairs, artificially ascending with a number of steps: But after∣ward
with a single Wall it reacheth up to the roof of Timber, well and surely
covered with Lead. But after an hundred and threescore years, King <HI>Henry</HI> the
third, subverted this Fabrick of King <HI>Edwards,</HI> and built from the very founda∣tion
a new Church of very rare Workmanship, supported with sundry rowes of
Marble Pillars, and the roofe covered over with sheets of Lead: a piece of work
that cost fifty years labour in building; which Church the <HI>Abbots</HI> enlarged very
much toward the West end; and King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh for the burial of him∣self
and his Children, adjoyned thereto, in the East end, a Chappel of admira∣ble
artificial elegancy, The Wonder of the Worlde, as <HI>Leland</HI> calleth it: for a
man would say, that all the curious and exquisite work that can be devised, is
there compacted; wherein is to be seen, his own most stately magnificial Mo∣nument,
all of solid and mass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Copper.</P>
<P>This Church, when the Monks were driven thence, from time to time, was
altered to and fro with sundry changes. First of all, it had a <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Preb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nda∣ries:</HI>
soon after one <HI>Bishop</HI> and no more, namely <HI>T. Thurlbey,</HI> who having wa∣sted
the Church Patrimony, surrendred it to the spoil of Courtiers; and short∣ly
after were the Monks with their Abbot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et in possession again by Queen <HI>Mary;</HI>
and when they also within a while after, were by authority of Parliament cast
out, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> converted it into a <HI>Collegiate</HI> Church, or rather into a
Seminary and Nurse-Garden of the Church, appointing twelve Prebendaries
there, and as many old Souldiers past service, for Alms-men, fourty Schollars,
who in their due time are preferred to the Universities; and from thence sent
forth into the Church and Common-weale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Over these they placed D. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll</HI>
Dean, whose Successor was <HI>Gabriel Goodman,</HI> a right good man indeed, and of

<P>There was also adjoyning hereto a Palace, the ancient Habitation of the
Kings of <HI>England,</HI> from the time of King <HI>Edward the Confessor,</HI> which in the
Raign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, was burnt by casual fire to the ground; A very
large, stately, and sumptuous Palace this was, and in that age, for building in∣comparable,
with a <HI>Vawmure,</HI> and Bulwarks for defence. The remains whereof,
are the Chamber wherein the King, the Nobles, with the Councellors, and,
Officers of State, do assemble at the High Court of Parliament; and the next
unto it, wherein anciently they were wont to begin the Parliaments known by
the name of St. <HI>Edwards painted Chamber,</HI> because the Tradition holdeth, that
the said King <HI>Edward</HI> therein dyed.</P>
<P>Adjoyning unto this, is the <HI>White-Hall,</HI> wherein at this day, the Court of
<HI>Requests</HI> is kept; beneath this is that Hall, which of all other is the greatest,
and the very <HI>Praetorium,</HI> or Hall of Justice, for all <HI>England,</HI> In this, are the Ju∣dicial
Courts; namely, The <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> The <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> and the <HI>Chan∣cery;</HI>
and in places near thereabout, the <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> the <HI>Exchequer, Court
of Wards,</HI> and Court of the <HI>Dutchy</HI> of <HI>Lancaster, &amp;c.</HI> In which at certain set
times, (we call them <HI>Termes)</HI> yearly Causes are heard, and tryed: whereas be∣fore
King <HI>Henry</HI> the third his dayes, the Court of Common Law, and prin∣cipal
Justice, was unsetled, and alwayes followed the <HI>Kings Court;</HI> But he in
the <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> made a Law in these words, <HI>Let not the Common Pleas follow
our Court, but be holden in some certain place;</HI> which notwithstanding, some
expound thus, That the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> from thenceforch be handled in a
Court of her own, by it self a part, and not in the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> as before. This
Judgement-Hall, which we now have, King <HI>Richard</HI> the second, built out of the
ground, as appeareth by his Arms, engraven in the Stone-work, and many Ar∣ched
Beams, (when he had plucked down the former old Hall that King
<HI>William Rufus</HI> in the same place had built before) and made it his own Habi∣tation;
For Kings in those dayes, sate in Judgement place, in their own per∣sons,
And they are indeed, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, Judges, <HI>whose mouth</HI> (as
the Royal Writer saith) <HI>shall not erre in judgement;</HI> But the foresaid Palace▪ af∣ter
it was burnt down, in the year of our Lord, 1512. lay desolate, and King
<HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, translated shortly after, the Kings Seat, from thence to an
House not far off, which belonged but a while before, to <HI>Cardinal Woolsey,</HI> and
is called <HI>White Hall.</HI> This House is a Princely thing, enclosed on the one side
with a Park, that reacheth also to another House of the Kings, named Saint
<HI>James</HI> (where anciently was a <HI>Spittle</HI> for <HI>Mayden Lepers)</HI> demolished by King
<HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, as is spoken else-where.</P>
<P>Hard by, near unto the <HI>Mues,</HI> so called, for that it served to keep <HI>Hawkes,</HI> and
now is become a most fair Stable for the Court Horses: there remaineth a Mo∣nument
in memorial of that most pious and kind Queen <HI>Eleanor,</HI> erected by
King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, her most dearly beloved Husband; and certainly,
the memory of her conjugal love shall remain worthy, to be consecrated to
eternity; For she, the Daughter of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the third, King of <HI>Castile,</HI> being
given in Mariage to <HI>Edward</HI> the first, King of <HI>England,</HI> accompanied him into
the Holy Land, where, when as he was secretly fore-laid, and by a certain <HI>Moor,</HI>
wounded with an envenomed Sword, and by all the remedies that Physitians
could devise, was not so much eased as afflicted, she took her to a strange cure,
I must needs say, and never heard of before; howbeit, full of love, care, and af∣fection.
For, her Husbands wounds infected with the poyson, and which, by
reason of the malignity thereof, could not be closed and healed, she day by
day, licked with her Tongue, and sucked out the venomous humor, which to
<PB N="355" REF="99"/>
her was a most sweet Liquor, by the vigour and strength whereof, or to say more
truly, by vertue of a Wives s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingular fidelity, she so drew unto her, all the sub∣stance
of the poyson, that the wounds being closed, and cicatrized, he becam
perfectly healed, and she caught no harm at all; what then can be heard
more ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, what admirable then this Womans faithful more love? That a
Wives Tongue thus annoynted, as I may so say, with faith and love to her Hus∣band,
should from her well beloved, draw those poysons, which by an approved
Physitian, could not be drawn; and that which many, and those right exquisite
Medicines effected not, the love only, and piety of a Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e performed: These
are the words of the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cient Record.</P>
<P>But we must not passe by the <HI>Mewse</HI> so sleightly; that place was called so of
the Kings Faulcons there kept, which in former times, was an Office of high
esteem; But <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, having his Stablings at <HI>Lomesberry,</HI> (now called
<HI>Blomesberry)</HI> which was then a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnor in <HI>Holborn,</HI> it fortuned, that the same
was consumed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, with Hay and Horses; whereupon, the <HI>Mewse</HI> was en∣larged,
and made fit for the Kings Stables, which hath continued ever since re∣ceiving
divers additions from time to time. But now we are according to the
method of our Discourse, summoned to appear at <HI>Westminster-Hall;</HI> But I
had almost pretermitted one signal thing, which belongs to the great Dome or
Temple of <HI>Westminster Abbey,</HI> which is the great priviledge of Sanctuary it had
within the Precincts thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> the Church, the Church-yard, and the Close,
whereof there are two; the little, and the great Sanctuary, vulgarly now called
Centry; from whence it was not lawful for the Soveraign Prince himself, much
lesse, any other Magistrate, to fetch out any that had fled thither, for any of∣fence:
which Prerogative, was granted near upon a thousand years since, by
King <HI>Sebert,</HI> then seconded by King <HI>Edgar,</HI> and afterwards confirmed by <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the Confessor, whose Charter I thought worthy the inserting here, the
Tenor whereof, runs thus, in the modern English.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> by the Grace of God, King of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> I make it to be known to all
Generations in the VVorld, after me, that by special Commandment of our holy Fa∣ther
Pope <HI>Leo,</HI> I have renewed, and honoured the holy Church of the blessed Apostle,
St. <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Westminster;</HI> and I order and establish for ever, that what Person, of
what estate or condition soever he be, and from whence soever he come, or for what
offence, or cause it be, either for his refuge into the said holy place, he be assured of his
life, liberty, and Limbs. And over I forbid under pain of everlasting damnation,
that no Minister of mine, or any of my Successors, intermeddle themselves with any
the Goods, Lands, or possessions of the said persons, taking the said Sanctuary; For I
have taken their Goods and Livelihoods into my special protection. And therefore I
grant to every each of them▪ in as much as my Terrestrial power may suffice, all man∣ner
of freedom of joyous liberty; and whosoever shall presume, or doth contrary to
this my grant, I will, he lose his name, VVorship, Dignity and Power; and that with
the great Traytor <HI>Judas,</HI> that betrayed our Saviour, he be in the everlasting fire of
Hell. And I will and ordain, that this my Grant, endure as long as there remaineth
in <HI>England,</HI> either love or dread of Christian name.</P>
<P>And this Record may be ranked among the most ancient of the Land. About
what time, King <HI>Edward the Confessor,</HI> did renew it, he removed St. <HI>Margarets</HI>
Church, which before was within the Abbey, to the place where now it stands.</P>

<HEAD>Of Westminster-Hall, and all the Tribu∣nalls
of Iustice, which have their motion
therein; And first of the High Court of
Parliament.</HEAD>
<P>HAving visited God Almighties House, we will now take a view of the chief
<HI>Praetorium</HI> of Great Britain, which is <HI>VVestminster-Hall,</HI> and of the
Courts of Judicature, which are thereunto annexed; And first, of the
Court <HI>Paramount,</HI> the high national Court of Parliament: vvhich great Coun∣cel
vvas used to be the Bulwark of our liberties, the boundary and bank vvhich
kept us from slavery, from the inundations of Tyrannical encroachments, and
unbounded <HI>VVill-Government.</HI></P>
<P>And in this High Court, there was used to be such a <HI>Co-ordination</HI> of power,
such a wholsome mixture 'twixt <HI>Monarchy, Optimacy,</HI> and <HI>Democracy,</HI> I mean,
'twixt Prince, Peers, and Commonalty, during the time of consultation, that
of so many distinct parts, by a rare co-operation and unanimity, they made but
one Body Politique (like that sheaf of Arrowes in the Fable;) they made but
one entire concentrical peece; and the results of their deliberations, but as so
many harmonious Diapazons arising from the touch of different strings. And
what greater mark of freedom can there be to a people, then to be lyable to
no Lawes, but what they make themselves? to be subject to no Contribution,
Assement, or pecuniary Levies whatsoever▪ but what they vote, and voluntarily
yield unto themselves. For in this great compacted <HI>Body politick,</HI> there be all
degrees of people represented; The Yeoman, Marchant, Tradesman, and me∣chanick,
have there their inclusive Votes, as well as the Gentry and Freeholders,
in the persons of their Trustees, <HI>viz.</HI> their Burgesses and Knights.</P>
<P>The Clergy also, which make a considerable part of the Common-wealth,
were used to have their Representatives there, not only in the persons of the
Bishops (which at the first constitution, were the prime Parliament, and con∣tinued
so many Ages) but in the Convocation which was an Assesmbly of Di∣vines,
fairly chosen to that purpose.</P>
<P>Nor is this Soveraign super-intendent Councel and Epitome of this Iland
only; but it may be said, to represent the whole Universe, according to the
primitive constitution.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soveraign Prince</HI> was as the <HI>Sun,</HI> the <HI>Nobles</HI> the fixed <HI>Starres,</HI> the Itine∣rant
<HI>Iudges,</HI> and other Officers, that were wont to go with Messages 'twixt both
Houses, to the <HI>Planets:</HI> The <HI>Clergy</HI> (when there was a Convocation House, as
was said before) to the <HI>Element</HI> of fire: The <HI>Commons</HI> to the solid body of
the <HI>Earth,</HI> and the rest of the Elements.</P>
<P>He who hath bin conversant with the Chronicles of this Iland, will finde it
hath bin her fare, to be four times conquered; but the <HI>Scot,</HI> never till now of
late. These so many Conquests, must needs bring with them, many tumblings
and tossings, many disturbances and changes in Government; yet I have ob∣served,
that notwithstanding these various tumblings, <HI>England</HI> retained still the
form of <HI>Monarchy,</HI> and something there was alwayes, that held an Analogy
with the great Assembly of Parliament.</P>
<P>The first Conquest was made by <HI>Claudius Caesar,</HI> at which time it may be said,
that the <HI>Standard</HI> of the Crosse came in together with the Roman Eagles▪ 'tis
well known, how the Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an governed. He had his <HI>Comitia,</HI> which bore a
<PB N="357" REF="100"/>
resemblance with our Convention in Parliament, the place of meeting was call∣ed
<HI>praetorium,</HI> and the Lawes which were enacted, were called <HI>Plebiscita.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Saxon</HI> Conquest succeeded next, in which were the <HI>English,</HI> and the <HI>Sax∣ons</HI>
governed by Parliament, though it was under other names, as <HI>Michel Ge∣mote,
Michel Sinoth,</HI> and <HI>VVitenage Mote.</HI> There are Records near upon a thou∣sand
years, of these Parliaments, in the Raigns of King <HI>Ina, Offa, Ethelbert,</HI> and
others.</P>
<P>The third Conquest was by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and they governed also by such gene∣rall
Assemblies, in the Raign of <HI>Canutus</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Then came the <HI>Norman,</HI> whose Successors did revive, and ratifie the way
of governing by Parliament, witness <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> which was used to be call∣ed
the Foundation of the English liberty; and it may be compared to divers
outlandish graffs set upon one stock: for the choysest of the <HI>British, Roman, Saxon,
Danish,</HI> and <HI>Norman</HI> Lawes, being cull'd and pick'd out, and gathered as it
were in one bundle, out of them the foresaid grand <HI>Charter</HI> was extracted: the
establishment whereof, was a work of a Parliament: Now by an ancient Sta∣tute
of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it was enacted, That all Statutes are repealed, which
are against <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> or <HI>Charta de foresta.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are the Lawes of this Iland only, and the immunities of the people con∣served
by Parliament; but all the best policed Countries of <HI>Europe</HI> have the
like. The <HI>Germans</HI> have their <HI>Diets:</HI> The <HI>Dane</HI> and <HI>Swedes</HI> their <HI>Rich-daghs.</HI>
The <HI>Spaniard, las Cortes;</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Assembly of the three Estates,</HI> though
it hath bin for many years discontinued.</P>
<P>And touching <HI>England,</HI> the Parliament was u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to be the principal Foun∣tain,
whence the Soveraign Prince derived his happiness and safety. It was the
great Conduit-Pipe, which conveighed unto him the Peoples bounty and love.
It was the truest Looking-Glasse, wherein he discerned their affections and al∣legiance.</P>
<P>In Parliament, the Soveraign Prince used to appear, like the Sun in the <HI>Me∣ridian,</HI>
in the altitude of his glory, in his highest <HI>Royal State,</HI> as the Law
tells us.</P>
<P>But we will go now more particularly to work, and treat of this great <HI>Nati∣onal
Conncel,</HI> according to the first constitution, and establishment thereof.</P>
<P>This Court consisteth of the Kings Majesty sitting there, as in his Royal po∣litick
Capacity, and of the three Estates of the Realm, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Lords <HI>spiritual
Arch Bishops</HI> and Bishops, being in number twenty four, who sit there by suc∣cession
in respect of their Counties, or Baronies parcel of their Bishopricks,
which they hold also in their <HI>politick</HI> Capacity; And every one of these, when
any Parliament is to be holden, ought, <HI>Ex debito justitiae,</HI> to have a writ of
Summons. The Lords <HI>Temporal</HI> Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, and Ba∣rons,
who sit there, by reason of their Dignities, which they hold by Descent or
Creation; and likewise, every one of these being of full age, ought to have
a writ of Summons, <HI>ex debito justitiae;</HI> for they are called <HI>Parliamentary Barons.</HI>
The third Estate is the <HI>Commons</HI> of the Realm, whereof there be Knights of
shires, or Counties, Citizens of Cities, and Burghesses of Burghes. All which
are respectively elected by the Shires or Counties, Cities and Burghes, by force
of the Kings Writ, <HI>Ex debito justitiae,</HI> and none of them ought to be omitted;
and these represent all the Commons of the whole Realm, and trusted for
them, and were used to be in number, near upon 500.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>King</HI> and these three Estates, were the great Corporation or Body
politick of the Kingdom; but they were to sit in two Houses, <HI>viz.</HI> the King
and Lords in one House, called the Lords House, and the Knights, Citizens and
Burgesses in another House, called the House of Commons.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="101"/>
The Commons are in Legal understanding, taken for the Franck Tenants,
or Freeholders of the Counties. And whosoever is not a Lord of Parliament,
and of the Lords House, is of the House of the Commons, either in person, or
by representation, partly coaugmentative, and partly representative.</P>
<P>Of this Court of Parliament, the Soveraign Prince by the Law is <HI>Caput prin∣cipium
&amp; finis,</HI> the head, beginning, and ending. And as in the natural body,
when all the sinews, being joyned in the head, do unite their forces together,
for the strengthening of the body, there is <HI>ultimum potentiae;</HI> so, in the poli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ique
Body, when the King and the Lords spiritual, and temporal, Knights, Citizens,
and Burgesses, are all by the Kings Command assembled and joyned together,
under the Head in consultation for the common good of the whole Realm there
is <HI>ultimum sapientiae.</HI></P>
<P>The third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, it appears in a Parliament Roll, that the
Parliament being called, as hath bin said, <HI>Commune Consilium</HI> every member of
the House being a Counsellor, should have the three properties of the <HI>Elephant;</HI>
which are First, That he hath no Gall.</P>
<P>Secondly, That he be inflexible, and cannot bow.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That he is of a most ripe and perfect memory; which properties,
as there it is said, ought to be in every Member of the great Councel of Parli∣ament.</P>
<P>First, to be without Gall, that is, without malice, rancor, heat, and envie,
In the Elephant, <HI>Melancholia transit in nutrimentum corporis,</HI> every gallish in∣clination
(if any were) should tend to the good of the whole body, the Com∣mon-wealth.</P>
<P>Secondly, That he be constant, inflexible, and not to be bowed, or turned
from the right, either for fear, reward, or favour; nor, in judgement, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pect any
person.</P>
<P>Thirdly, of a ripe memory▪ that they remembring perils past, might pre∣vent
dangers to come, as in that Roll of Parliament it appeareth.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>de advisamento consilii</HI> (for so be the words of the Writ of Parlia∣ment)
resolving to have a Parliament, doth out of the Court of <HI>Chancery,</HI> send
out Writs of Summons, at the least forty dayes before the Parliament begins:
every Lord of Parliament, either spiritual, as Arch bishops, and Bishops; or tem∣poral,
as Dukes, Marquisses, Earls, Viscounts, and Barons, Peers of the Realm,
and Lords of Parliament, were used to have several Writs of Summons.</P>
<P>And all the Judges of the the Realm, Barons of the Exchequer of the Coif, the
Kings learned Cousnel, and the Civilians Masters of the <HI>Chancery,</HI> are called to
give their assistance and attendance, in the upper House of Parliament; but
they have no <HI>Voices</HI> in Parliament, being only ministerial; and their Writs
differ from the Writs to the Judges; for their Writs be, <HI>Quòd intersitis Nobis∣cum
&amp; cum caeteris de Concilio Nostro,</HI> (&amp; sometimes <HI>Nobiscum</HI> only) <HI>super prae∣missis
tractaturi, vestrumque consilium impensuri;</HI> But the Writ to the Barons is,
<HI>Quòd intersitis cum praelatis, Magnatibus &amp; proceribus, super dictis negotiis trac∣taturi,
vestrumque Consilium impensuri.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Moreover, in every Writ to Summons to the Bishops, there is a clause re∣quiring
them to summon these persons to appear personally at the Parliament,
which is in these words,</HI> premonientes Decanum &amp; Capitulum Ecclesiae Vestrae Nor∣wicensis,
ac Archidi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conos totumque clerum vestrae Dioces, quod iidem Decani &amp;
Archi diaconi in propr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is persmiss suis, ac dictum capitulum per unum, idem{que} cle∣rus

hiis quae tunc ibidem de Communi concilio dicti regni Nostri divina favente clemen∣tia
contigerit ordinari; <HI>and the Bishop under his Seal makes Certificate accor∣dingly.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="101"/>
And these are called <HI>Procuratores cleri,</HI> and many times have appeared in
Parliament, as spiritual Assistants, to consider, consult, and consent, <HI>ut supra;</HI>
but had never voyces there, because they were no Lords of Parliament; And
this Assembly was called the <HI>Convocation-House,</HI> which the last King continu∣ing,
(after the dissolution of the Parliament) and the Bishops comming a∣mongst
them to consult, and make <HI>Canons,</HI> the next Parliament protested a∣gainst
their proceedings as irregular, and prejudicial to the priviledges of Par∣liament.</P>
<P>Observable it is, what difference there was in the Writ, whereby the spiri∣tual
Lords were summoned, and that whereby the temporal Lords were called.
The <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Barons were required by the Kings Writ to be present, <HI>In
fide &amp; dilectione quibus nobis tenemini,</HI> In the faith and <HI>Love</HI> you are bound to
us; But the secular Lords were summoned to appear, <HI>In fide &amp; homagio, quibus
nobis tenemini.</HI> In the faith and <HI>homage</HI> you are bound unto us; Now touching
the Commons, their Writ or Summons to the Sheriff runs thus.</P>

<P>This Commission or Writ, is the foundation, whereon the whole fabrick of
the power, and duty of both Houses of Parliament is grounded.</P>
<P>The first House is to parley, or have conference, and to treat and consult with
the King, the other House is to do and consent only unto what the other shall
ordain.</P>
<P>This was the Law and usage in former times; but what is the power of the
Commons in these dayes now that the Government is altred, and cast into
another mould, (the House of Peers being dissolved) it is not the intent of this
Discourse to determine.</P>
<P>At the return of the Writs aforesaid, the Parliament could not begin, but
by the Royal presence of the King, either in Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, or by Representation▪ By
Representation two wayes, either by a <HI>Gardian</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> by Letters Patenrs
under the Great Seal, when the King was <HI>in remotis,</HI> out of the Realm; or by
<HI>Commission,</HI> under the Great Seal, to certain Lords of Parliament, representing
the Person of the King, he being within the Realm, but absent in respect of some
infirmity.</P>
<P>On the first day of the Parliament, the King himself, or most commonly,
the Lord Chancellor, or Keeper, in the presence of the Lords and Commons,
did shew the causes of the calling of High Court of Parliament; but the
King might have appointed any other to be his Prolocutor, in this
case.</P>
<P>Then the Commons are to choose their Speaker; but in regard, that after
their choyce, the King might refuse him; for avoiding of time and contestation,
the use was as in the <HI>Congè deslire</HI> of a Bishop, that the King doth recom∣mend
a discreet and learned man, whom the Commons elect; but without
their Election, no <HI>Speaker</HI> can be appointed for them, because he is their mouth,
and intrusted by them, and so necessary, that the House of Commons cannot
sit without him: therefore a grievous sickness is a good cause to remove him,
as in <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>4th</HI> Raign, <HI>Iohn Chervy</HI> Speaker, was for sickness discharged and
Sir <HI>Iohn Dorewoold</HI> chosen in his place; but sickness is no cause to remove any
Knight, Citizen or Burgesse.</P>
<P>The <HI>Speaker</HI> being voted in the House, was presented to the King, where be∣ing
allowed, he made a supplication consisting of three parts.</P>
<P>First, That the Commons in Parliament might have free speech.</P>
<P>Secondly, That in any thing he should deliver in the name of the Commons,
if he should commit any error, no fault should be imputed to the Com∣mons.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That as often as necessity for his Majesties service, and the good of
the Common-wealth shall require, he may by the directions of the House, have
access to his Royal Person.</P>
<P>Any of the Pee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, by the Kings leave, may absent himself, and make a proxy
to another Lord; but a Knight, Citizen, or Burgess, cannot make a <HI>Proxy,</HI> be∣cause
he is elected, and intrusted by multitudes of people. And it is to be ob∣served,
though one be chosen for one particular County or City, yet when he is
returned, and sits in Parliament, he serveth for the whole Common-wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="102"/>
There belongs to Parliament, a <HI>Prorogation,</HI> or <HI>adjournment,</HI> which differ in
this: A <HI>Prorogation</HI> presupposeth a <HI>Session,</HI> and then such Bills as passed in
either House, or by both Houses, and had no Royal assent unto them, must at
the next Assembly begin again; for every Session in Parliament, is in Law a se∣veral
Parliament; but if it be but adjourned, then there is no
Session.</P>
<P>When a Parliament is called, and doth sit, and is dissolved without any Act
passed, or judgement given, it is no <HI>Session</HI> of Parliament, but a <HI>Con∣vention.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the Power and Jurisdiction of <HI>Parliament,</HI> for making of Lawes in
proceeding by Bill, it is so transcendent, and absolute, as it cannot be confined
within any bounds.</P>
<P>No <HI>Alien</HI> is capable to be chosen a <HI>Parliament-man,</HI> nor can any of the
Judges of the Kings Bench, or Common Pleas, or Barons of the Exchequer,
that have Judicial places, or any Church-man, that hath care of souls, be chosen
a member of the House of <HI>Parliament:</HI> For others, the King cannot grant a
Charter of <HI>Exemption</HI> to any man, to be freed from Election of Knight or Bur∣gesse
of the <HI>Parliament,</HI> because the Elections of them, ought to be free for the
publique service.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE
COVRT
OF THE
KINGS-BENCH,
THE
Royallest Court in the Land;
Now called,
The Upper Bench.</HEAD>
<P>THe Lawes of <HI>England,</HI> presuppose the King to be the Fountain and
Oracle of Justice, and to have special inspirations from Heaven to
that purpose; therefore all the Tribunals of Judicature, were used to
be <HI>ambulatory</HI> with his Court, and He was wont to sit in Person in
the <HI>Upper Bench,</HI> which is the Supreme Tribunal of the Land.</P>
<P>The Justices in this Court, are the soveraign Justices of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI>
Goal-delivery, Conservation of the Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Realm.</P>
<P>In this Court the Kings of this Realm have sat, as being the highest Bench,
and the Judges of that Court on the lower Bench at his Feet; but Judicature
only belongeth to the Judges of that Court, and in his presence they answer all
Motions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Justices of this Court are the soveraign Coroners of the Land, and there∣fore,
where the Sheriffs and Coroners may receive appeals by Bill <HI>à fortiori,</HI> the
Justices of this Court may do it: so High is the authority of this Court, that
when it comes and sits in any County, the Justices of <HI>Eire,</HI> of <HI>Oier</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI>
Coal-delivery, they which have <HI>conusance, &amp;c.</HI> do cease without any writing
to them; But if any Indictment of Treason or Felony in a Forain County, be
removed before certain Commissioners of <HI>Oier</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> in the County
where this Court sits, yet they may proceed, because this Court (for that this
Indictment, was not removed before them) cannot proceed for that offence;
But if any Indictment be taken in <HI>Midd▪</HI> in the vacation, and after this Court
sit in the next Term in the same County (if this Court be adjourned) then may
special Commissioners of <HI>Oier</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> &amp;c. in the interim proceed upon
that Indictment; but the more usual way is by special Commission. And this
was resolved by all the Judges of <HI>England</HI> at <HI>Winchester, Anno 1' Iacobi Regis,</HI>
in the Case of Sir <HI>Everard Digby</HI> and others, and so had it been resolved, <HI>Mich.

Court, that if any Record be removed into this Court, it cannot (being as it
were in his Center) be remanded back, unlesse it be by Act of <HI>Parliament;</HI>
And this appeareth by the Judgment of the Parliament, in <HI>Anno 6. H.</HI> 8. but
by the authority of that Act, Indictments of Fellonies and Murders, removed
into the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> may by the Justices of that Court be remanded, and this
Court may send down aswell the Bodies of all Felons and Murderers, as their
Indictments, into the Counties where the same Murders of Felonies were com∣mitted
or done, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in such manner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as if the Indictments had not been

<P>Before the Reign of <HI>E.</HI> 1. the Chief Justice of this Court was created by

<P>The King <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to all Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons,
Vicounts, Foresters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to all other faithful to the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI>

&amp;c. for the exhibition of justice to all and every one of our Kingdom,
We ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e constituted our beloved and faithful <HI>Philip Basset</HI> chief Justice of

<P>This <HI>Philip Basset</HI> was the last of this kind of creation by any like <HI>Letters Pa∣tents,</HI>
and he died Chief Justice near to the end of the Reign of <HI>H.</HI> 3. King E. 1.
being a wise and prudent Prince, knowing that <HI>Cui plus licet quam par est, plus

<P>These Justices of the Kings Bench, are styled, 1. <HI>Capitales. 2. Generales.
3. Perpetui. 4. Majores à latere Regis residentes;</HI> But the Chief Justice is only
by the King, <HI>Capitalis Justiciarius noster.</HI> They are called first <HI>Capitales,</HI> in re∣spect
of their supream Jurisdiction. 2. <HI>Generales,</HI> in respect of their general
jurisdiction throughout all <HI>England, &amp;c. 3. Perpetui,</HI> for that they ought not
to be removed without just cause, 4. <HI>Majores à latere Regis residentes,</HI> for their
honor and safety, that they should be protected by the King in administration
of justice, for that they be <HI>à latere Regis,</HI> that is, by the Kings fide. And vvhere∣as
5. <HI>E.</HI> 4. it was holden by all the Justices in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> Chamber, that a
man cannot be Justice by <HI>Writ,</HI> but by <HI>Patent,</HI> or Commission, it is to be un∣derstood
of all the Judges, saving the <HI>Chief Justice</HI> of this Court; But both the
<HI>Chief Justice,</HI> and the rest of the Judges may be discharged by Writ under the
Great Seal.</P>
<P>None can be a Judge of this Court, unlesse he be a <HI>Serjeant</HI> of the degree of
the <HI>Coif;</HI> and yet in the Writ or Patent to them made, they are not named <HI>Ser∣geants.</HI></P>
<P>There have been for a long time, and still there are great Complaints for mul∣tiplicity
of Suits in Law, and it were a wholsome and happy thing, could it be
prevented: but because a Disease cannot be cured without knowledge of the
Cause, it is to be observed, that there be six Causes of the increase of them,
whereof two be general, the other four particular; The general be Peace, and
Plenty; The particular, 1. The dissolution of so many Monasteries, Chan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ries,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the dispersing of them into so many several hands. 2. The
swarm of Informers. 3. The number of Concealors. 4. The multitude of At∣turneys.</P>
<P>For the first general; In the Reign of <HI>E. 3. R. 2. H. 4. H.</HI> 5. and part of the
Reign of <HI>H.</HI> 6. in respect of the wars in <HI>France, &amp;c.</HI> &amp; in the residue of the Reign
of <HI>H.</HI> 6. &amp; in the Reign of <HI>E.</HI> 4. in respect of the bloody &amp; intestine Wars, &amp; in
almost continual Alarms within the bowls of this Kingdom, between the Hou∣ses
of <HI>Lancaster</HI> &amp; <HI>York,</HI> there could not be so many Suits in Law, as since this
Kingdom hath enjoyed Peace, which is the first general cause. Peace is the Mo∣ther
of Plenty, (which is the <HI>2d</HI> general cause) and Plenty the Nurse of Suits.
In particulars, by the dissolution of Monasteries, Chanteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and dispersing
of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon the Statutes made concerning the same (there being such a
confluence of Ecclesiastical possessions) there aro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e many questions, and doubts,
whereupon Suits were greatly increased. 2. Informers and Relators raised ma∣ny
Suits, by Informations, Writs, &amp;c. in the Kings Courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> up∣on
penai Statutes, many whereof were <HI>obsolete,</HI> inconvenient, and not fit for
those daies, and yet remained as snares upon the Subject, so as the Subject might
justly say with <HI>Tacitus, Priùs vitiis laboravimus, nunc legibus.</HI> 3. Concealers;
<HI>Helluones</HI> that endeavoured to swallow up Cathedral Churches, and the Eccle∣siastical
possessions of Church-men, and the Livings of many others of the Kings
Subjects. Lastly, the multitude of Atturneys, more than is limited by Law,
is a great cause of encrease of Suits.</P>
<P>Touching the jurisdiction of this Court, which was used to be called the
<HI>King Bench,</HI> it is of a larger extent of power, and more incontroulable than
any other Tribunal: for the Law presums, that the King is there still in Person:
<PB N="365" REF="104"/>
He being the Lord <HI>Chief Justice of England</HI> himself: as King <HI>James</HI> gave a check
to one who call'd Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> Lord <HI>Chief Justice</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> saying,
that he was but Chief Justice of his Bench, and that it was his own Office to be
<HI>Chief Justice of England;</HI> Yet it is observable, that though the King be Chief Ju∣stice
of <HI>England,</HI> and that he personally sit upon the Bench, yet he can passe no
sentence of judgment, but by the mouths and mediation of his Judges, who
did use to sit there at his Feet when he was present.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Court of Chancery, or Equity and
Conscience.</HEAD>
<P>IT is taken <HI>pro confesso</HI> by all Antiquaries, that both the <HI>Brittish,</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI>
Kings, had their <HI>Chancellors,</HI> and Court of <HI>Chancery,</HI> the only Court out
of which original and remedial Writs do issue; as taking some few ex∣amples
before the Conquest.</P>
<P>Edward <HI>the Confessor had</HI> Reinbald <HI>his Chancelor; this</HI> Edward <HI>granted ma∣ny

<P>King <HI>Etheldred</HI> also had a worthy name, and a worthy man to his Chancelor,
<HI>Rex</HI> Etheldredus <HI>statuit atque concessit quatenus Ecclesiam de Elye ex tunc &amp;

Reign <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 978, which albeit, it was void in Law to grant the Chance∣lorship

<P>King <HI>Edgar</HI> had <HI>Adulph;</HI> King <HI>Edred</HI> had <HI>Thurkettle,</HI> King <HI>Edmond</HI> the same,
King <HI>Athelstane Wolsine,</HI> their Chancelors &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the Chancery are two Courts, one ordinary, <HI>Coram Domino Rege in Cancel∣laria,</HI>
wherein the Lord Chancelor, or Lord Keeper of the Great Seal proceeds,
according to the right line of the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, <HI>Secundum
legem &amp; consuetudinem Angliae;</HI> Another extraordinary according to the Rule
of equity, <HI>secundum aquum &amp; bonum;</HI> And first of the former Court.</P>
<P>He hath power to hold Plea of <HI>Scire fac'</HI> for repeal of the Kings Letters Pa∣tents,

Staple, upon the Act of 23. <HI>H.</HI> 8. but the Execution upon a Statute
Merchant is retornable, either into the Kings Bench, or into the
Common place, and all personall actions by or against any Officer or
Minister of this Court in respect of their service or attendance there; In these
if the parties descend to issue, this Court cannot try it by Jury, but the Lord
Chancelor or the Lord Keeper, delivereth the Record by his proper hands into
<PB N="366" REF="105"/>
the Kings Bench to be tried there, because for that purpose both Courts are
accounted but one; and after trial had to be remanded into the Chancery, and
there Judgment to be given. But if there be a <HI>Demurrer</HI> in Law, it shall be argu∣ed
and adjuged in this Court. <HI>Nota,</HI> the legal proceedings of this Court, be not
inrolled in Rolls, but remain in <HI>Filaciis,</HI> being filed up in the Office of the
Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y-bag: upon a judgement given in this Court, a Writ of Error doth lye re∣tornable
into the Kings Bench. The style of the Court of the Kings Bench is
<HI>Coram Rege,</HI> (as hath been said) and the style of this Court of Chancery is <HI>Coram
domino Rege in Cancellaria,</HI> and <HI>Additio probat minoritatem;</HI> And in this Court,
the Lord Chancelor or the Lord Keeper is the sole Judge, and in the Kings
Bench there are four Judges at the least.</P>
<P>This Court is <HI>Officina Justiciae,</HI> out of which all original Writs, and all
Commissions which passe under the Great Seal go forth; which Great Seal is
<HI>Clavis regni,</HI> and for those ends this Court is ever open.</P>
<P>And this Court is the rather alwaies open, for that if a man be wrongfully
imprisoned in the Vacation, the Lord Chancellor may grant a <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI>
and do him Justice according to Law, where neither the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> nor <HI>Com∣mon
Pleas,</HI> can grant that Writ, but in the term time; but this Court may grant
it either in Term time or Vacation: so likewise this Court may grant Prohibi∣tions
at any time, either in Term or Vacation: which Writs of Prohibition are
not retornable, but if they be not obeyed, then may this Court grant an <HI>At∣tachment,</HI>
upon the Prohibition retornable, either in the Kings Bench or
Common Place.</P>
<P>The Officers and Ministers of this Court of Common Law do principally at∣tend,
and do their service to the Great Seal, as the twelve Masters of the Chan∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,
whereof the Master of the Rolls is the chief, who by their original institu∣tion,
as it is proved before, should be expert in the Common Law, to see the
forming and framing of original Writs, according to Law, which are not of
course; whereupon such are called in our ancient Authors, <HI>Brevia Magistralia;</HI>
Then you have the <HI>Clerk of the Crown,</HI> the <HI>Clerk of the Hamper,</HI> the <HI>Sealer,</HI> the
<HI>Chafe wax,</HI> the <HI>Controuler</HI> of the Chancery, twenty four <HI>Cursitors</HI> for making
Writs of course, or form'd Writs according to the Register of the Chancery;
The <HI>Clerk</HI> of the <HI>presentations,</HI> the <HI>Clerk</HI> of the <HI>Faculties,</HI> the <HI>Clerk Examiner</HI> of
the Patents, the Clerks of the <HI>Petty-bag,</HI> and the <HI>six Attorneys.</HI></P>
<P>Having spoken somewhat of this Court's ordinary Jurisdiction, something
shall be said of the extraordinary proceedings thereof, according to the Rule of
<HI>Equity, secundum aquum et bonum,</HI> or according to the dictates of Conscience;
for the Lord Chancelor, or Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> may be said to
be <HI>Keeper of the Kings Conscience,</HI> for mitigation of the rigour of the Common
Law. Yet this Court of Equity proceeding by English Bill, is no Court of
Record; therefore it can bind but the <HI>Person</HI> only, and neither the <HI>State</HI> of the
Defendants Lands, nor property of his <HI>Goods,</HI> and Chattles; therefore if the
Lord Chancelor impose any fine, it is void in Law, he having no power but on
the <HI>Person</HI> only.</P>
<P>Yet the Lord Chancelor or Keeper, is sole Judge both in this Court of Equi∣ty,
and in the Court concerning the Common Law; but in cases of weight or
difficulty, he doth assist himself with some of the Judges: and no greater excep∣tion
can be taken hereunto, than in case of the Lord <HI>Steward</HI> of <HI>England,</HI>
being sole Judge in tryal of the Nobility, who also is assisted with some of the
Judges.</P>
<P>Touching this Court of Equity, the ancient Rule is, that three things are to
be considered in a Court of Conscience; <HI>Covin, Accident, and Breach of confi∣dence;</HI>
All Covins, collusions, frauds, and deceits, for which ther's no remedy by
the ordinary course of Law. <HI>Accident,</HI> as when the servant of an Obligor or
<PB N="367" REF="105"/>
Morgageor, is sent to pay the money on the day, and he is robb'd &amp;c. then reme∣dy
is to be had in this Court against the for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eiture; The third is breach of tru't
and confidence, whereof there are plentiful examples.</P>
<P>The ancient Custome was when one was made Lord Chancellor, for the
King to hang the Great Seal about his Neck. Cardinal <HI>Woolsey</HI> had the Chance∣lorship
by Letters Pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents during life, but it was held void because an ancien
Office must be granted as it was accustomed. <HI>Henry</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had two great
Seals, one of Gold, which he delivered the Bishop of <HI>Durham;</HI> and another oft
Silver, which he delivered the Bishop of <HI>London.</HI> The Chancellors Oath con∣sists
of six parts.</P>
<P>1. That well and tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly he shall serve the King our Soveraign Lord, and his
People in the Office of Chancellor, or Lord Keeper.</P>
<P>2. That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shall do right to all manner of people poor and rich, after the
Laws and usages of the Realm.</P>
<P>3. That he shall truly Counsel the King, and his Counsel, he shall layne (or
conceal) and keep.</P>
<P>4. That he shall not know, nor suffer the hurt or disheriting of the King, or
that the Rights of the Crown be decreased, by any means as far as he may
let it.</P>
<P>5. And in case he cannot let it, he shall make it clearly and expresly to be
known to the King, with his true advice and counsel.</P>
<P>6. He shall do and purchase the Kings profit in all that he reasonably
may.</P>
<P>There be in this Court many Officers, whereof mention is made before,
the principal whereof is the <HI>Master of the Rolls,</HI> which is an ancient Office, and
grantable either for life or at will, according to the Prince his pleasure. <HI>Edward</HI>
the third by Letters Patents, annex'd the House of the <HI>converted Iews</HI> in Chan∣cery
Lane to this Office, for keeping of the Records of the Chancery, <HI>viz.</HI> Char∣ters,
Letters Patents, Commissions, Deeds, Recognizances▪ which before the
Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, were used to be transmitted to the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI>
The Master of the Rolls used to have <HI>Iure Officii,</HI> the gift of the Offices of the six
Clerks in the Chancery; and in the absence of the Lord <HI>Chancellor,</HI> he heareth
Causes, and giveth Orders.</P>

<P>IN times pass'd, the Courts and Benches, or Banks of Justices (as was
touched before) followed the Kings Person wheresoever he went, as well
since the Conquest as before: which thing being found chargeable and
cumbersome; The ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, it was resolved, that there
should be a standing place appointed, where matters should be heard and deter∣mined;
And the Court of the <HI>Common Pleas</HI> was the first that was fix'd, where∣in
tenures of Lands, and civil Actions used to be pleaded; And it is one of the
Statutes of <HI>Magna Charta, Quod Communia placita non sequantur Curiam nostram
sed teneantur loco certo,</HI> That the Common Pleas follow not our Court, but be
kept in a certain place. Now, <HI>Pleas</HI> are distinguished into Pleas of the Crown,
as Treason and Felony, with misprision of Treason and Felony, (which belong
to the Upper Bench) and to Common or Civil Pleas, whereof this Court takes
Cognizance. This Court therefore is call'd, the <HI>Lock and Key</HI> of the Common
Law of <HI>England,</HI> and the Judges there sitting had need to be more knowing,
and learned than any other; for here all Reall Actions whereupon Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and
recoveries, the common assurances of the Land do passe, and all other reall
Actions by original Writs, are to be determined, as also of all Common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

authority; But regularly this Court cannot hold Common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in
any Action, real, mix'd or personal, but by Writ out of the Chancery and re∣turnable
to this Court; yet this Court in some cases may hold Plea by Bill
without any Writ in the Chancery: as for, or against any Officer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
or priviledged Person of this Court. This Court also, without any Writ may
upon a suggestion grant <HI>Prohibitions,</HI> to keep Temporal as well as Ecclesiastical
Courts, within their bounds and jurisdictions, without any Original, or Plea
depending; for the Common Law, which in those cases is a Prohibition of it
self stands instead of an Original.</P>
<P>The Chief Justice of this Court, is created by <HI>Letters Patents</HI> during the plea∣sure
of the Prince, and so are the rest of his Associats, but none is capable to be

Filazers, Clerk of the Juries, Clerk of the Essoins, Clerk of the Outlaries, which

<HEAD>OF THE
COVRT
OF THE
EXCHEQUER.</HEAD>
<P>THe Authority of this Court is of Original Jurisdiction, without any
Commission. In the chief place of account for the Revenues of the
Crown; The Hearers of the accounts have Auditors under them, and
they who are the chief for the accounts of the Prince, are called <HI>Barons</HI> of the
Exchequer, whereof one is called Lord Chief Baron. The greatest Officer of
all is the Lord <HI>Treasurer.</HI> In this Court are heard, those that are <HI>Delators</HI> or <HI>In∣formers</HI>
in popular or penal Actions, having thereby part of the profit assign'd
unto them by the Law. In this Court, if any question be, 'tis determined by
the Common Law of <HI>England,</HI> by twelve men, and all Subsidies, Taxes, and Cu∣stomes
by account; For in this Office the <HI>Sheriffs</HI> of the Countries do attend
upon the execution of the Commandements of the Judges. If any Fines or A∣mercements
be extracted out of any Court or any arrearages of accounts of such
things as is of Customes, Taxes, &amp; Subsidies, and other such like occasions, the
same the Sheriff of the Country doth gather, and is answerable therefore to the
<HI>Exchequer.</HI></P>
<P>This Court is divided into two parts, <HI>viz. Iudicial accounts</HI> called, <HI>Scaccarum
computorum,</HI> And into the <HI>Receit of the Exchequer,</HI></P>
<P>The prime Officer of this Court, as was me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tioned before, is the Lord
high <HI>Treasurer</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> who receives a <HI>White Staff</HI> from the King; But in
former time he had this Office by delivery of a <HI>Golden Key.</HI> Then there is
<HI>Cancellarius Scaccarii</HI> the Chancelor of the Exchequer, who keepeth the Seal.
Then you have the chief <HI>Baron,</HI> and his Associates, whereof one, though he sits
there, yet he hath no voice; therefore he was used to be call'd by way of Drol∣lery,
<HI>Baron Tell-clock;</HI> yet he takes the same Oath that others do, he hath a Fee
of 100 Marks <HI>per annum;</HI> At daies of <HI>prefixions,</HI> he hath to do with the Sheriffs
Accounts, he can take Recognizances; but he hath not the Robes, nor any
suffrage upon the Bench in point of Judicature; And that nickname Baron
<HI>Tellclock</HI> came up first in Baron <HI>Southertons</HI> time, who when he felt the Chimes
ring in his Stomach towards dinner, he was us'd to tell chief Baron <HI>Tanfield,
My Lord 'tis twelve a clock.</HI></P>
<P>Then have you sundry other inferiour Officers, more then in any other Court,
except the Kings House.</P>
<P>This Court is called <HI>Exchequer</HI> from a French word <HI>vne place quarree</HI> a four∣square
place, because the Carpet that lay before the Judges, is in the form
of a Chess-board, and of two colours: thence the name of <HI>Exchequer</HI> was
derived.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="107"/>
Now, it is to be observe'd, that albeit the <HI>Barons</HI> are the sole Judges of the
Exchequer Court, yet the Lord Treasurer is joyn'd with them, in keeping of the
Records. The Lord Treasurer hath also granted him by Parent under the great
Seal, <HI>Thesaurarium Scaccarii Regis Angliae,</HI> which of ancient time, as the Lord
<HI>Coke</HI> hath it, was a distinct Office by it self.</P>
<P>Then is there the <HI>Pipe Office,</HI> whereof the Chancelor of the Exchequer is
<HI>Contrarotulator</HI> or Controuler. The Original institution of the <HI>Pipe Office</HI> was
taken from a Conduit of water, which was conveyed by Pipes into a Cestern
which lay in a Court: for as water is derived from many Fountains Springs,
by Aquaeducts into a Cestern House, and from thence into several Offices of the
same: so this golden and silver stream is drawn from sundry Courts as Foun∣tains
of Justice, and other Springs of Revenue reduc'd and collected into one
Pipe, and thereby conveyed into the Grand Cestern of the Princes receit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Therefore all Accounts and Debts to the Crown are delivered and collected out
of the Offices of the Kings <HI>Remembrancer,</HI> and Treasurers Remembrancer, and
so drawn, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in charge in the Pipe. There be five Auditors of the Reve∣nue
Royal within the survey of this Court, and their Office is, to take Accounts
of the Kings Receivers, Sheriffs, Escheators, Collectors, and Customers, and to
audite and perfect the Account; But an Auditor cannot allow any Licence or
Grant, in regard he knoweth not whether it be good, this belongs to the Barons;
Neither can the Auditor put any thing in Charge, his Office being only to take
and audite Accounts. There is the Auditor of the Prests, whose Office it is to
take the Accounts of the <HI>Mint, Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Barwick,</HI> and of all other imprested
or moneys advanc'd before hand.</P>
<P>Then is there the Auditor of the Receits, which is an Office very considera∣ble,
and consisting of many parts; For first, he is a kind of Filazer, for he fileth
the Tellers Bills, and entreth them. Secondly, he is a Remembrancer, for he
gives the Lord Treasurer a certificate of the money received the week before.
Then he is an Auditor, for he makes Debenturs to every Teller, before they pay
any money, and takes and audites their Accounts. Besides all this, he keepeth
the black Book of Receits, and the Lord Treasurers Key of the Treasury, and
seeth every Tellers money lock'd up in the new Treasury. Of those Tellers
there are four, and their Office consists in four duties.</P>
<P>First, to receive money due to the Soveraign Prince.</P>
<P>Secondly, to pay all persons moneys by Warrant of the Auditor of the Re∣ceit.</P>
<P>Thirdly, to make yearly and weekly Books of their Receits and payments,
which they deliver to the Lord Treasurer.</P>
<P>And lastly, to give the <HI>Clerk of the Pell</HI> a Bill of what moneys they receive,
whereby he may be charged.</P>
<P>Now, touching <HI>Clericus Pellis</HI> the Clerk of the Pell; his duty is, to enter eve∣ry
Tellers Bill into a Roll call'd <HI>Pellis Receptorum;</HI> his Office also is, to enter in∣o
another Roll payments, call'd <HI>Pellis exitus,</HI> signifying by what Warrant the
payment was made.</P>
<P>Concerning the Kings Remembrancer in the Exchequer his Office, con∣sists
in eight Duties;</P>
<P>First, to write Process against Collectors of Customs, Subsidies, and Fif∣teens.</P>
<P>2. He entreth in his Office all Recognizances before the Barons, and taketh
Bond for any of the Kings Debts, for observing of Order, for appearances, and
his duty is to make out Process upon every of them.</P>
<P>3. He maketh Process upon Informations upon penal Statutes, all which In∣formations
are entred into his Office.</P>
<P>4 He maketh Bills of composition upon Informations upon penal Statutes.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="107"/>
5. He taketh the stallment of Debts, and entreth them.</P>
<P>6. The Clerk of the Star-Chamber, was us'd to certifie into his Office what
fines were there set, whereof he maketh a Record, and draweth them down
in the Pipe.</P>
<P>7. In this Office ought to be kept all Assurances, Conveyances and Eviden∣ces
whereby any Lands, Tenements, Herediraments, or other things are gran∣ted
to the Soveraign Prince.</P>
<P>8. There is a Court of Equity holden in the Exchequer Chamber by <HI>English</HI>
Bill, whereof all the proceedings and Bills are entred into this Office.</P>
<P>The Lord Treasurers Remembrancer, is also an Office of trust, and conse∣quence,
which consisteth of seven Duties.</P>
<P>First, To preserve the Royal tenures, and to make out Process for the Reve∣nues
thereof.</P>
<P>2. He maketh Process of <HI>Fierifacias,</HI> to extend for Debts due to the Prince,
either in the Pipe or with the Auditors.</P>
<P>3. He awards Process against all Sheriffs, Escheators, Receivers, and Bay∣liffs,
to bring them to account.</P>
<P>4. He is to make an entry of Record, whereby it appears whether Sheriffs,
and other Accountants pay their proffers due at <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Michaelmas.</HI></P>
<P>5. He makes another entry of Record, to the end that it may be known, whe∣ther
Sheriffs and other Accounts keep their day of prefixion.</P>
<P>6. The green Was is certified into this Office, and by him delivered to the
Clerk of the Estreats.</P>
<P>7. There ought to be brought into this Office, all the Accounts of Custo∣mers,
Controulers, and all other, to make an entry of Record in this Office, to
avoid delay and concealments.</P>
<P>The Oath of the <HI>Barons</HI> of the Exchequer, consists of ten parts.</P>
<P>First, That he shall well, and truly serve in the Office of <HI>Baron.</HI></P>
<P>2. That, truly he shall charge, and discharge all manner of people, as well
poor as rich.</P>
<P>3. That for Higness, nor for Riches, nor for hatred, nor for any deed, gift,
or promise of any person, which is made unto him, nor by craft engine, he shall
let the Kings right.</P>
<P>4. He shall not let, disturbe, or respite contrary to the Lawes of the Land
the Right of any other person.</P>
<P>5. He shall not put in respite the Kings Debts, where goodly they may be le∣vied.</P>
<P>6. That he shall speed the Kings need before others.</P>
<P>7. That neither for gift, wages, nor good deed, he shall layn, disturb, nor let
the profit or reasonable advantage of the King, in the advantage of any other
Person, nor of himself.</P>
<P>8. That nothing he shall take of any Person to do wrong or right, to delay, or
deliver, or to delay the people that have to do before him, that as hastily as he
may them goodly, to deliver without hurt of the King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>9. Where he may know any wrong or prejudice to be done to the King, he
shall put and do all his power and diligence that to redresse.</P>
<P>10. The Kings Counsel he shall keep and <HI>layne</HI> in all things.</P>
<P>In the Exchequer Chamber, all cases of difficulty, either in the Kings bench,
or the Common Pleas, were used to be debated, argued, and resolved by all the
Judges of <HI>England,</HI> and the Exchequer <HI>Barons.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Treasurer</HI> of the Kings Chamber, and the Keeper of the privy purse, with
such domestick Offices of the Kings House, are not subject to this Court of
Exchequer.</P>
<P>This Court was first erected for the particular profit and service of the Sove∣raign
Prince; And this profit is mediat or immediat; Immediat, as of Lands,
<PB N="372" REF="108"/>
Rents, Franchises, Hereditaments, Debts, Duties, Accounts, Goods, Chatrels,
and other profits, and benefits whatsoever due unto the Soveraign Prince. Me∣diate,
as the priviledge of the Officers, and Ministers of the Court; for two
things do principally support the jurisdiction of a Court (as my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> hath
it) first the preservation of the dignity thereof, and then the due attendance of
the Officers and Ministers of the same.</P>
<P>The chief Baron is created by Letters Patents, and the Office is granted,
<HI>Quamdiu se bene gesserit,</HI> wherein he hath a more fixed estate, it being an estate of
life, than the Justices of other Benches have, who are <HI>durante beneplacito;</HI> And
in like manner are the rest of the Barons, constituted with the Patents of the
Attorney General and Solicitor.</P>
<P>There is a Court called the Court of Equity in the Exchequer Chamber. The
Iudges of this Court are the Lord Treasurer, the Chancelor of the Exchequer,
and the Barons; Their jurisdiction is as large for matter of Equity, as the Ba∣rons
of the Exchequer have for the benefit of the King by the common Law,
but if in either Court they hold any Plea that doth not concern the profit of the
King, there lieth a Prohibition.</P>
<P>To conclude, there are seven Courts that belong to the Exchequer. 1. The
Court of Pleas or of the Barons. 2. The Court of Accounts. 3. The Court
of Receits. 4. The Court of the Exchequer Chamber, being the Assembly of
all the <HI>Iudges</HI> of <HI>England</HI> for matters in Law. 5. The Court of Exchequer
for Errors in the Court of Exchequer. 6. A Court in the Exchequer Cham∣ber
for Errors in the Kings Bench. 7. The Court of Equity, spoken of a little
before.</P>
<P>But touching all the Officers, either coordinate or inferior, that belong to the
Exchequer, and the Revenues Customes, &amp; perquisits of the Soveraign Prince,
they are very many, &amp; far more in number than in any other Court as was tou∣ched
before; yet nothing so numerous as those Financiers, and swarm of other
Officers which belong to the Revenues of <HI>France,</HI> which are so many that their
fees being payed there comes not a <HI>Quardecu</HI> in every Crown clearly to the
Kings Coffers, which is but the fourth part: But there is one publick advantage
in it, that thousands of younger Brothers, and others, have a handsome subsistance,
to carry themselves hereby in the garbe and equipage of men.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE
COURT
OF
ADMIRALTY.</HEAD>
<P>HAving thus made some inspections into so many Courts, we
must not pretermit the <HI>Court of Admiralty;</HI> for <HI>Great Britain</HI> being
an Island which makes the Sea, and Woodden Castles, to be her
chiefest Conservators: the Court of <HI>Admiralty</HI> may be said to be
more pertinent and necessary to her, then to divers other States: therefore
the Lord High Admiral is by the Law of <HI>England,</HI> one of the four Officers of
the Crown, with the Lord Chancelor, the Lord Treasurer, and Lord privy Seal.
Some hold the Etymology of <HI>Admirall,</HI> to come from the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
which signifieth <HI>Salsugo maris,</HI> the saltness of the Sea; others derive it from
<HI>Ammir,</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> word, which signifieth a King, or Emperor; And some
would have it to come from the low Dutch, <HI>Aen-meer-all,</HI> which signifie, <HI>on
the Sea all,</HI> The Reader, according as his own judgement leads him, may ad∣here
to which he please; for I know of none that have positively asserted, which
is the truest.</P>
<P>But to know the nature and jurisdiction of this Court, it will conduce very
much, if we insert here certain grievances which the Lord Admiral presented
in the <HI>8th</HI> year of K. <HI>Iames,</HI> concerning <HI>Prohibitions</HI> granted by the Judges of the
Courts of <HI>Westminster,</HI> against the Jurisdiction and Prerogatives of this Court,
with the answer which the Judges returned to every point.</P>
<P>1. The first Objection was, that whereas the cognizance of all Contracts,
and other things done upon the Sea, belongeth to the Admirals jurisdiction, the
same are made tryable at the common Law, as if they had bin done in <HI>Cheapside</HI>
and such places.</P>
<P>The Judges of <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI> answered, that by the Lawes of the Realm,
the Court of the Admiral hath no cognizance, power, or jurisdiction of any
manner of Contract, plea, or querele, within any County of the Realm, either
upon the Land or the water; but every Contract, Plea, or querele, and all o∣ther
things arising in any County of the Realm, either upon the Land, or the
water; and also Wrecks of the Sea, ought to be tryed, discussed, determined,
and remedied by the common Lawes of the Land, and not before, or by, the
Admiral or his Lieutenant, in any manner; so that it is not material, whether
the place be upon the water, <HI>intra fluxum &amp; refluxum aqua,</HI> or whether it be
upon any other water within the precincts of a County. But the said Judges
acknowledged, that of Contracts, pleas, and quereles, made upon the Sea, or
any part thereof, which is not within any County, from whence no tryal can
be had by twelve men, the Admiral hath, and ought to have jurisdiction. And
no president can be shewed, that any Prohibition hath bin granted for any plea,
contract, or querele, concerning any Marine cause, made or done upon the
Sea, taking that only to be the Sea, wherein the Admiral hath his jurisdiction,
which is before described by Law to be out of any County.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="109"/>
2. The second Objection was, that when actions are brought to the Admi∣ralty,
upon Bargains and Contracts, made beyond the Seas, wherein the com∣mon
Law cannot administer justice; yet in these cases, prohibitions are a∣warded,
in prejudice of the Court of Admiralty.</P>
<P>The Judges answer, that Bargains and Contracts made beyond the Sea,
wherein the common Law cannot administer justice, do belong to the Consta∣ble
and Marshal; For the jurisdiction of the Admiralty, is wholly confined to
the Sea, which is out of any County; but if any Indenture, Bond, or other
specialty, or any Contract, be made beyond the Seas, for doing of any act, or
payment of any money, within this Realm, or otherwise, wherein the com∣mon
Law can administer justice, and give ordinary redress: In these cases,
neither the Constable nor Marshal, nor the Court of Admiralty, hath any juris∣diction:
therefore when that Court hath proceeding, in derogation of the
common Law, prohibitions have bin issued out, as by the Law they ought.</P>
<P>3. The third Objection was, that whereas time out of minde, the Court of
Admiralty hath taken stipulations for appearance, and performance of the acts
and judgements of the same Court, It is now affirmed, by the Judges of the
common Law, that the Admirals Court, is no Court of Record, and therefore
not able to take such stipulations: hereupon, prohibitions are granted, to the
utter overthrow of that jurisdiction.</P>
<P>The Judges answered, that the Court of the Admiralty, proceeding by the
course of the Civil Law, is no Court of Record, and therefore cannot take any
such a recognizance as a Court of Record may. And for taking Recognizanses
against the Law of the Realm, we finde, that prohibitions have bin granted.
And if an erroneous sentence be given in that Court, no Writ of Error, but an
appeal before certain Delegates do lye, which proves, 'tis no Court of Re∣cord.</P>
<P>4. The fourth Objection was, that Charter parties, made only to be per∣formed
upon the Seas, are daily withdrawn from that Court by prohibi∣tions.</P>
<P>The Judges answered, That if the Charter party be made within any City,
Port-Town, or County of this Realm, although it be to be performed, either
upon the Seas, or beyond the Seas, yet it is to be tryed and determined by the
ordinary course of the Common Law, and not in the Court of the Admiralty,
And therefore, when that Court hath encroached upon the common Law, in
that case, the Iudge of the Admiralty, and party there suing, have bin prohibi∣ted,
and oftentimes the party condemned, in great and grievous dammages, by
the Lawes of the Realm.</P>
<P>5. The fifth Objection was, that notwithstanding the clause of <HI>Non obstante
statuto,</HI> which hath foundation in his Majesties Prerogative, and is current in
all other grants; yet in the Lord Admirals Patent, 'tis said to be of no force,
to warrant the determination of the Causes, committed to him in his Lord∣ships
Patent, and so rejected by the Iudges of the common Law.</P>
<P>The common Lawyers answer, that without all question, the sundry Statutes
which declare the jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty, and wherein all the
Subjects of the Realm have interest, cannot be dispensed with, by any <HI>non ob∣stante
statuto;</HI> and therefore not worthy of any answer; but by colour there∣of
the Court of Admiralty hath, contrary to those Acts of Parliament, en∣croached
upon the jurisdiction of the common Law, to the intolerable grie∣vance
of Subjects, which hath oftentimes urged them to complain, in his Ma∣jesties
ordinary Courts of justice in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> for their relief in that
behalf.</P>
<P>6. The sixth Objection was, that to the end that the Admirals jurisdiction,
might receive all manner of empeachment, and interruption, the Rivers be∣neath
the first Bridges where it ebbeth and floweth, and all the Creeks and
<PB N="375" REF="109"/>
Ports are by the Iudges of the common Law, affirmed to be no part of the Sea,
nor within the Admirals jurisdiction, and thereupon, prohibitions are ordina∣rily
awarded upon actions depending in that Court for Contracts, and other
things done in those places, notwithstanding, that by use and practise, time out
of minde, the Admirals Court hath had jurisdiction, within such Ports, Creeks,
and Rivers.</P>
<P>The Judges answer was like to their first, And 'twas further added, that for
the death of a man, or mayhm in those two cases, only done in great Ships, be∣ing
and hovering in the main stream only, beneath the point of some Ri∣vers
nigh unto the Sea, and no other place of the same Rivers, nor in other
causes, but only in those two, the Admiral hath cognizance. But for all Con∣tracts,
Pleas, and Quereles, made or done upon a River, Haven, or Creek with∣in
any County of this Realm, the Admiral without question hath no jurisdicti∣on;
for then he should hold plea of things, done within the Body of the Coun∣ty,
which are tryable by verdict of twelve men, and meerly determinable by the
common Law, and not within the Court of the Admiralty, according to the
Civil Law; for that were to change and alter the Lawes of the Realm in like
cases, and make those Contracts, Pleas, and Quereles, tryable by the common
Law of the Realm, to be drawn off <HI>ad aliud Examen,</HI> and to be sentenced by the
Iudges of the Admiralty, according to the Civil Law.</P>
<P>7. The seventh Objection was, that the Agreement made <HI>Anno</HI> 1575. between
the Judges of the Kings Bench, and the Court of the Admiralty, for the more
quiet and certain Execution of Admiral Iurisdiction, is not observed as it
ought to be.</P>
<P>The Iudges answered, that the supposed Agreement, mentioned in the Ar∣ticle,
hath not as yet bin delivered them; but having heard the same read be∣fore
his Majesty; they answer'd, that for so much thereof, as differeth from these
answers, it is against the Lawes, and Statutes of this Realm: therefore the
Iudges of the Kings Bench, never assented thereunto, as was preten∣ded.</P>
<P>8. The eighth Objection was, That many other grievances there were, which
in discussing of these former, would easily appear worthy of Reformation.</P>
<P>To this the Judges answered, that this Article was so general, as no particu∣lar
answer can be made thereunto, only it appeareth, by that which hath bin
said, that the Lord Admiral his Officers and Ministers principally by colour of
that <HI>Non obstante,</HI> and for want of learned advice, have injustly encroached up∣on
the common Lawes of this Realm; for which the marvel is the lesse, be∣cause
that the Lord Admiral his Lieutenants, Officers, and Ministers, have with∣out
all colour, intruded upon the Right and Prerogative due to the Crown, in
that they have seized and converted to their own use, Goods and Chattels, of
infinite value taken at Sea; and other Goods and Chattels, which in no sort,
appertain unto his Lordship, by his Letters Patents, wherein the said <HI>Non ob∣stante</HI>
is contained; and for which, he and his Officers, remain accountable
to his Majesty; And they now wanting, in this time of peace, causes apper∣taining
to their natural jurisdiction, do now encroach upon the jurisdiction
of the common Law, lest they should sit idle, and reap no profit.</P>
<P>They added further, That touching their proceedings in granting of Pro∣hibitions
concerning any of the said <HI>Articles,</HI> two things were to be considered
of, first the <HI>matter,</HI> then the <HI>manner;</HI> touching the matter, nothing hath bin
done therein, by the Court of <HI>Westminster,</HI> but by good Warrant of Law, and
former judicial Precedents; And for the manner, they granted none in the Va∣cation
time, nor in their Terme time, in any of their Chambers, nor in the
Court in the Terme-time, <HI>ex officio,</HI> but upon motion made in open Court, by
learned Councel; and after a day prefixed, and warning given to the adverse
party, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="110"/>
Hereupon they proceeded, to prove and confirm their answers, by three kind
of Authorities in Law.</P>
<P>First, By Authority of High Court of Parliament.</P>
<P>Secondly, By Judgement, and judicial Precedents.</P>
<P>Thirdly, By Book-Cases.</P>
<P>Concerning the Acts of Parliament, they urged the Statute of <HI>Richard</HI> the
second, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That the Admiralls and their Deputies, shall not meddle from henceforth, with
any thing done within the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> but only with things done upon the
Sea, according to that which hath been duly used in the time of the Noble King <HI>Ed∣ward,</HI>
Grandfather to <HI>Richard</HI> the second.</P>
<P>Concerning the second proof by Judgements, and <HI>Iudicial Precedents,</HI> and
the third by <HI>Book-Cases,</HI> they alledged divers Cases, which are to be seen in that
great light, and laborious Champion of the Common Law of <HI>England,</HI> the Lord
<HI>Coke,</HI> in the third part of his <HI>Institutes;</HI> But, the Result of all which the
Iudges of the Common Law driv' at, was, that the Court of Admiralty, was to
take no Cognizance, nor had power to determine any thing that had happen∣ed,
and should give occasion of Plea, upon any Waters, either fresh or salt, that
were within the Precincts of any County; but it was tryable by the Com∣mon
Law of <HI>England,</HI> and by the Empanelment, and Verdict of twelve men,
which is not the way of Tryal of the Civil Law, by which the Admiralty is di∣rected.</P>
<P>By this notable clash, and contestation 'twixt the Iudges of <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI>
and the <HI>Lord Admiral,</HI> the Reader may learn what the extent of the Authority
of that Court is, and that the jurisdiction of the Admiral is confined to the
high Sea.</P>
<P>In times past, there were distinct Admirals, in point of power, as we read
in <HI>Richard</HI> the seconds Raign, the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was Admiral of the
North; and the Earl of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> Admiral of the West: who were to receive
the Subsidy of Poundage and Tonnage, for the garding of the Seas.</P>
<P>Among other Prerogatives, which belonged to the Lord Admiral of <HI>England,</HI>
one was to erect <HI>Beacons</HI> upon the Maritim Coasts; which word, is derived
from the old <HI>Saxon,</HI> or <HI>Dutch Becnam,</HI> which signifieth, to give a signe, as we use
the word, to <HI>becken at</HI> to this day.</P>
<P>Before the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>3d,</HI> there were but stakes of Wood, set upon
high places, which were fired, upon the discovery of any enemies; but in his
time, pitched Barrels were set up; and by the Law of the Land, whosoever fired
a <HI>Beacon, commits Felony,</HI> unless there were Authority and just cause for it.</P>
<P>In other Countries they are called <HI>Phares,</HI> which are no other then <HI>specula∣tory,</HI>
or maritime monitory fires, which serve for two ends, as well to direct
Seafaring men, as to fore-warn the approach of an Enemy; which with such
wonderful celerity, give the whole Land an Alarum, and so puts them in a po∣sture
of defence.</P>
<P>But there are three main matters, whereof the Lord Admiral is to take
Cognizance, which are <HI>Flotsan, Ietsan,</HI> and <HI>Lagan:</HI> whereof the first is, when
a Ship is sunk and perished, and the Goods floating upon the waters: The se∣cond
is <HI>Ietsan,</HI> when in stresse of weather, or other occasions, the Goods are
thrown over-board. The third is, when Goods are tyed to a Cork, or Cable,
and may be found again; But the Court of Admiralty, hath not to do with
<HI>Wrecks;</HI> for then the Goods are deposited in the custody of the Officers of the
next Town, where, if the Proprietor come within a twelve moneth and a day,
he may claim them by Law.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="110"/>
<HI>Henry</HI> the sixth did constitute by Charter, <HI>Iohn Holland,</HI> Duke of <HI>Exceter,</HI>
and <HI>Henry</HI> his Son, to be <HI>Admirallos Angliae:</HI> But the Iudges of the Common
Law, held that Charter to be invalid; and the Reason they alledged, was, that
that Charter being of a <HI>Iudicial</HI> Office, it could not be granted to two.</P>
<P>When the former contestation happened 'twixt the Court of <HI>Admiralty</HI> and
<HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> they were choyse powerful men at that time, who swayed as
<HI>Grandees</HI> of the <HI>Common Law,</HI> as Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> the Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> Iudge <HI>Dod∣dridge,</HI>
and <HI>Hubbard,</HI> which made them carry the Bucklers from the <HI>Civilians,</HI>
at that time; But there were some learned Treatises published afterward, to
vindicate the Right of the <HI>Civil Law;</HI> which, without controversie, hath more
in it of natural equity, and reaches of pure Reason, then any other: It is the
Product of that mighty Monarchy of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who though they conquered
by the <HI>Lance,</HI> yet they con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by their <HI>Lawes,</HI> so many vast distant Territo∣ries,
and Nations, which they had subdued, leading so many people Captive by
their <HI>policy,</HI> as much as by their <HI>Prowesse;</HI> And indeed, the <HI>Civil Law</HI> is fitted
for the general Affaires of mankind, and for all Nations; For though every
particular state hath some few municipal Lawes peculiar to it self: yet no
where beyond the Seas is there any profession or Science of Law, but of the <HI>Civil;</HI>
nor are there any other studied in <HI>Vniversities.</HI> Only in <HI>England</HI> there are <HI>Inns
of Court,</HI> which are equivalent to an <HI>Academy,</HI> where <HI>lex Terrae,</HI> or the common
municipal Law of the Land is studied, and Graduates proceed, and are made
therein accordingly, which is no where else; But the <HI>Civil Law</HI> extends to all
man-kind. And, if regard be had to the University of humane Reason, it is no
where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o narrowly discussed, and eventilated, and the judgement rectified by
clear notions: Moreover, there is nothing, of what nature soever it be but the
<HI>Civil Law</HI> hath ordained a means to bring it to a Tryal, either by giving a spe∣ciall
action in the case, or a general one releeving by ordinary remedies; or if
those fail, by such as are extraordinary, helping the Clyent, <HI>Iure actionis,</HI> or <HI>Of∣ficio
Iudicis.</HI> Yet there was one notable Example of one business, that not
only caused a clash 'twixt the <HI>Civilian,</HI> and <HI>Common Lawyer,</HI> but puzzel'd them
both so that neither could try it. It was, that one <HI>Peacock,</HI> struck <HI>Lacy in alto
Mari,</HI> and the Ship landing at <HI>Scarborough, Lacy</HI> dyed a little after, of the
stroke that was given at Sea: there was a great contestation, whether the Court
of Admiralty, or the common Lawyer, should try <HI>Peacock;</HI> but it was found,
that the cognisance hereof belonged to neither, so the party escaped without
condemnation.</P>
<P>But now we will resume the thred of our Survay of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and add to
that which hath bin already spoken of the <HI>Great Hall,</HI> which as it hath bin, and
continueth still the usual place of pleadings, and ministration of Justice; so it
was in former times, the principal Seat, and Palace of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI>
since the Conquest; for here the Feasts of Coronation, and other solemn
Feasts, as that of <HI>Christmas</HI> were kept: It is recorded, that at the day of Cir∣cumcision,
<HI>Henry</HI> the third commanded his Treasurer, <HI>William de Haverhull,</HI> to
cause 6000. poor people to be fed at <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> upon the Kings account;
<HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the Kings Brother, <HI>Anno</HI> 1243. being married to
<HI>Cincia,</HI> Daughter to the Countesse of Provence, kept his Bridall Feast at <HI>West∣minster-Hall,</HI> where, the story saith, there were three thousand dishes of meat,
served in at dinner.</P>
<P><HI>Rich.</HI> the second having repaired the Great Hall which had bin burnt by a pit∣tiful
fire, kept his <HI>Christmas</HI> there, in a most sumptuous manner, with Justings,
and running at Tilt, where there was such a huge confluence of People, that for
divers dayes, there were spent 26. fat Oxen, and 300 Sheep. The King him∣self
wore a Gown of Cloth of Gold, garnished with precious stones, which was
valued at 3000 marks, a mighty sum in those dayes.</P>

<P>Parliaments also were used to be kept frequently at <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> and
one was kept in <HI>Richard</HI> the seconds time, which proved fatal unto him; for
he was deposed there, notwithstanding, that he had bin the greatest Repairer of
that Hall, when it had bin destroyed by fire. For it hath bin the hard destiny
of this Great Hall, to suffer many times the fury of fire; but the last that hap∣pened,
was in the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighths Raign, <HI>Anno</HI> 1512. at which
time, a great part of the Palace was consumed, which was never re-edified since;
so that the Kings Courts, have bin from that time, sometimes at <HI>Baynards</HI>
Castle, then at <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and since at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> called before, <HI>York place,</HI> as
hath bin said before.</P>
<P>In this great Palace at <HI>Westminster,</HI> there was St. <HI>Stephens</HI> Chappel, which was
built by King <HI>Stephen</HI> himself; It was repaired and enlarged by <HI>Edward</HI> the third,
and 38. persons were appointed there to serve God, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Dean,</HI> 12. secular
Canons, 13. Vicars, 4. Clarks, 6. Chorists, a Verger, and a Keeper of the Chap∣pel,
who had endowments, and Houses built them near the Thames: there
were also, Lodgings assigned them, 'twixt the Clock-house, and the Wooll-Staple,
called the <HI>Weigh-house:</HI> He also built for their use, a strong Clochard, in
the little Sanctuary, covered with Lead, where there were three great Bells,
which usually rung at Coronations, and Funeralls of Princes, which gave such
a huge sound, that 'twas commonly said they sowred all the drink in the Town;
but now there's scarce any marks left of that Clochard.</P>
<P>This Chappel of St. <HI>Stephens,</HI> at the suppression in <HI>Henry</HI> the eights time,
was valued to dispend one thousand eighty five pounds; and in <HI>Edward</HI> the
sixths time it was made to serve as a Parliament for the House of <HI>Commons,</HI> who
formerly were used to sit in the <HI>Chapter-house</HI> of the Abbot of <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>Before the Great Hall, there is a large Court, called now the new Palace,
where there is a strong Tower of Stone, containing a Clock, which striketh on a
great Bell every houre, to give notice to the Judges, how the time passeth;
when the wind is <HI>South South-West,</HI> it may be heard into any part of <HI>London,</HI> and
commonly, it presageth wet weather: The <HI>Dean</HI> of St. <HI>Stephens,</HI> was used to
ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the keeping of this Clock, having six pence every day out of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI>
for keeping the <HI>Kings Clock,</HI> or Great <HI>Tom</HI> of <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>We must now make a step Southward, before we leave <HI>Westminster,</HI> and per∣form
some further devotions to the old Abbey, the prime Sanctuary of the
Land; whereunto belongs another very ancient priviledged place, and Sanctu∣ary
of St. <HI>Martin le Grand,</HI> hard by <HI>Aldersgate</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> whereas formerly was
said, there was of old a fair and large Colledge of a <HI>Dean,</HI> and secular Canons or
Priests, founded by <HI>Ingelricus</HI> 1056. and confirmed a little after by <HI>William</HI> the
Conqueror, as appeareth by that ample Charter he gave thereunto, which in re∣gard

<P>This priviledge of Sanctuary, was confirmed, and strictly enjoyned by divers

<P>Touching the hard <HI>Saxons</HI> word of this Charter, the Reader is referred to
those worthy persons, who made additionals to Mr. <HI>Stow,</HI> where he shall find
them explain'd; For many Ages, this Saint <HI>Martin le Grand,</HI> continued by it self
a place of as great priviledges, as <HI>Westminster,</HI> or <HI>Beverlay,</HI> which were counted
the chiefest in the whole Land; But <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>7th</HI> annexed it at last, to the Mo∣nastery
of St. <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> which claims Title ever since, to the free
Chappel, the Priviledges, and Sanctuary thereof, and hath enjoyed it, without
controlement or question.</P>
<P>And now before we bid a farewel to <HI>Westminster,</HI> we will acquaint the Rea∣der
in brief, with the modern Civil Government thereof; Now as <HI>London</HI> is
divided into 26. <HI>Wards,</HI> so <HI>Westminster</HI> is partition'd to 12. for the which, the
<HI>Dean</HI> of the <HI>Collegiat Church,</HI> was wont with the high <HI>Steward,</HI> to elect 12. Bur∣gesses,
and as many Assistants, <HI>viz.</HI> one Burgesse, and one Assistant, for every
Ward: out of which twelve, two are nominated yearly, upon <HI>Thursday</HI> in
<HI>Easter</HI> week, for chief Burgesses to continue for one entire year, who have Au∣thority
to hear, examine, determine, and punish according to the Lawes of the
Realm, and Customs of the City, matters of incontinency, common Scolds,
Inmates, with publique annoyances; and likewise to commit such persons, as
shall offend against the peace, giving notice thereof within 24. houres, to some
Justice of the Peace, in the County of <HI>Middlesex;</HI> And this mode of Go∣vernment,

LONDON,

Other great Cities of the World.</HEAD>
<P>HAving hitherto rambled up and down the streets of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and pryed into every corner thereof; having endea∣voured
to fetch Her from her very <HI>Cradle,</HI> (which may not
be improperly said; for we found Her at first a Grove of <HI>Wood)</HI> and
so attended Her all along, to that marvellous degree of perfection,
she is now arrived unto, by insensible Coalitions of people, im∣provement
of Trade, and encrease of Structures: We will now, for
the better illustration of things, and further enlightning of the Rea∣der,
make a Comparison or Parallel 'twixt Her, and other great Ci∣ties
of the World, which are accounted Cities of the <HI>first Magni∣tude;</HI>
for as the <HI>Starres</HI> in Heaven are distinguish'd by degrees of
Magnitude, so are <HI>Cities</HI> on the Earth: Or, to descend lower, as there
are <HI>Ships</HI> of the first, second, and third <HI>rate;</HI> so there are <HI>Cities,</HI>
Now among those various wayes, which tend to convey knowledge to
the understanding, &amp; rectifie ones judgement, Examples, Compari∣sons,

parts, and variety of Habitations: By others, to a great piece
of Embrodery, enchas'd up and down, whereof the most bossie, and
richest compacted parts are Towns and Cities, where People are
linked in a nearer bond of love, and lead a more civil course of life;
For <HI>Urbanity,</HI> and <HI>Civility,</HI> derived their names first from thence.</P>
<P>These Comparisons are lesse wide, and more significant, then that
which <HI>Lucian</HI> makes, when, by way of drollery, he makes the greatest
<HI>Cities</HI> upon Earth, to appear like so many <HI>Birds Neasts.</HI></P>
<P>It is a Catholique truth, wherein all Chronologers, &amp; Antiquaries,
do unanimously concur, that in the non-age of the World, man-kind
had no other Habitation then Woods, Groves, and bushy Queaches,
which they fenc'd about with Hardles made of twigs, and loose
Stone-walls, to defend them from the invasions of wild and ravenous
Beasts; some lived in Caves, and concavities of Rocks, to shelter
themselves from the inclemency, and rigor of the Air: Insomuch, that
all men were <HI>Troglodites</HI> at first, as there are many Nations, who are
housed so to this day, making themselves holes and hollowes, in
Rocks, and sandy dry grounds, as we find in this Iland some of those
Troglodites, both in <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and <HI>Bridge-north.</HI> Then by degrees,
they made themselves small Huts: from Huts, they came to build
Houses, and so to cohabit in Hamlets: and thence sprung up Towns
and Cities.</P>
<P>The first of any same, was that stupend, or City of <HI>Babylon,</HI> foun∣ded
by <HI>Nimrod,</HI> the great Hunter; and enlarged by that notable <HI>Virago,
Semiramis:</HI> which was girded about with Walls, 200. foot high, and
fifty broad, whereof the Circuit was 300 Furlongs; she had also
300. Turrets upon the Walls, which were of such a latitude, that
Chariots might go upon them; and if old Historians may oblige us
to a belief, there were three hundred thousand men that were em∣ployed
in the building thereof; she continueth still, a vast and flou∣rishing
City, called by the Turks <HI>Bagdat; Asia</HI> being the most <HI>Orien∣tall</HI>
Countrey on this side the Hemisphere, as it was first peopled,
for <HI>Adam</HI> was that Countreyman; so Towns, Cities, Castles, Al∣tars,
and other Buildings, first began to be erected there; and indeed,
all other knowledge, besides <HI>Architecture,</HI> came first from those parts,
being next Neighbors to the rising Sun: The Indian <HI>Brachmans,</HI> or
<HI>Gymnosophists,</HI> were the first scientifical men, and Students of Philoso∣phy;
The Persian <HI>Magi</HI> were her next Students: Then she cross'd the
red Sea, and came to <HI>Memphis,</HI> among the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> whence she
steered down the <HI>Nile,</HI> and got over the <HI>Aegean</HI> Seas to <HI>Corinth</HI> and
<HI>Athens</HI> among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> whence she took wing to <HI>Rome,</HI> and from
thence she clammer'd ore the <HI>Alps</HI> to <HI>France, Germany, Great Britany,</HI>
and other <HI>North-west</HI> Climats.</P>
<P>Now as <HI>Asia</HI> had the first Cities, so she glories to have to this day
<PB N="383" REF="113"/>
the greatest: we will instance only in the City of <HI>Quinzay,</HI> who arro∣gates
to her self, the name of the <HI>Celestial City,</HI> whereof divers modern
Authours do write portentous things; and truly, he must have a strong
Faith, who will believe them: She is the chief City of the Empire
of <HI>China,</HI> lying under the same Climate as <HI>Venice</HI> doth, with whom
she hath a great resemblance, being built upon the South side of a
huge Laque; she hath in length about forty miles, in latitude thirty,
and one hundred and twenty miles in circumference; she hath above
a thousand Bridges, some whereof are so high, that Ships under saile,
may passe under them: Her Houses are of Stone and Earth; the
lowest whereof, is five stories high, of marvellous beauty and
strength: She hath many magnificent Temples, but one next the Royal
Palace, of a stupendious structure, being of that altitude, that the as∣cent
is threescore and fower marble stairs: There are an incredible
number of fair Palaces in her; among which, after that of the Em∣perour,
those of the ten Governours, are the stateliest, and among
them that of the Captain of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>About the Center of the City; stands the Imperial Court, which
is fenc'd about with seven Walls, whereof every one is garded by
ten thousand Souldiers, the Palace is ten miles in Circuit, and hath
fourscore great Halls; but that where the great Councel sits is four
square, and hath Windows and Gates looking towards the four parts
of the Heaven, East, West, North and South, where officers and o∣thers
that have business, do enter, according to the scituation of the
Countrey, whence they come, there being above threescore several
Kingdoms, under the Dominion of the Emperor, and every one hath
a particular Hall and Councel, where they deliberate, touching the
Government of every Kingdom. 'Tis such a ravishing voluptuous
place; that there are objects to please and charm all the five senses,
The eyes are fed in beholding the goodly Structures, Gardens, and
Trees which are up and down: The Eares by hearing, the chirping
of the Birds, and sweet murmure of the waters; The <HI>smell</HI> is feasted
with odoriferous sent of flowers, and other rich perfumes; The <HI>Taste</HI>
by most delicate fruits; And the other sense, by most beautiful, and
ravishing Women; which are able to tempt a Stoick, having by their
rowling large eyes, and other postures, extraordinary wayes of al∣lurement.
There was a computation made of above a million of Hou∣ses
within her, so that allowing ten to a Family, there be ordinarily
about ten Millions of humane souls that breath within the City; They
are very rich in their Habits, and there is not much difference in the
Clothes of male and female, only the women have more diversity of
colours; blew and red are the commonest, but black is never worn:
There be Birds there, of such a wonderful bigness, that they will take
up a whole Mutton alive, up into the Air, and sometimes a man in
Armor.</P>
<P>There are abundance of <HI>Elephants, Dromedaries, Camels,</HI> and other
huge Beasts, that do their work; And all Animals, both volatil, and
terrestrial, are there, of a bigger size and proportion, then any where
<PB N="384" REF="114"/>
else, by special influences of the Heavens: It is incredible, what num∣ber
of Nations do resort thither for Traffique and Commerce, as all
the <HI>Indies, Cathay, Tartary, Arabia,</HI> and <HI>Persia;</HI> They are rare <HI>Artists;</HI>
for 'tis thought, that Guns and Printing were there invented thou∣sands
of years agoe; their Characters, and way of reading, being not
either from the left hand to the right, as the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latines</HI> use; or
from the right hand to the left, as the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and all the Dialect
thereof, as the <HI>Arabian, Persian,</HI> and others, but perpendicular down∣ward:
There is one Law amongst them, that conduceth much
to make them such exquisite Artisans, which is, that the Sonnes are
alwayes of their Fathers Trade, whereby they come to have a more
natural dexterity, genius, and aptitude to the Trade, and their Pa∣rents
train them therein more industriously, and discover unto them
all the mysteries thereof.</P>
<P>Touching the rare <HI>China</HI> Dishes and Cups they make, the masse of
Earth, whereof they are moulded, useth to be buried in lumps, with∣in
the bowels of the Earth, sometimes a hundred years before they
fall to work upon it, and such a masse of aged Earth is the common
Patrimony, that Parents use to leave their Children: In fine, they
pretend to so much sagacity, wit, and industry, that 'tis a saying a∣mong
them, that They only have two eyes, the <HI>Europaeans</HI> one, and all
the rest of the World is blind.</P>
<P>They have such a high opinion of their King, that they think he is
descended of the race of some <HI>demy-God,</HI> and so adore him accor∣dingly.</P>
<P>They believe there is some Divinity in his blood, insomuch, that
he never marries any, but either his own Sister, or Daughter, or next
a kin, for fear of staining the Royal Blood; He is seldom seen open∣ly,
but he hath a private place, when his Councel sits, whence he
may hear whatsoever is agitated, and he signifieth his pleasure invi∣sibly
through certain hollow Trunks, and he gives audience to Am∣bassadors
also in that manner.</P>
<P>We will now over the Red Sea to <HI>Afrique,</HI> and take a short tran∣sient
Survay of the <HI>Gran Cairo</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> a City also of a huge Gigan∣tique
stature, being near upon forty miles compasse, having five and
thirty thousand <HI>Meskeetos,</HI> that is, Churches and Chappels: There
are in her four and twenty thousand noted streets; some whereof are
two miles in length, every one is locked up in the night, with a dore
and Chains at each end: There is a huge number of Horsmen, under
the command of so many <HI>Saniacks,</HI> which watch and gard the
Town all the year long, to the number of eight and twenty thousand
men, for fear of the incursions of the wild <HI>Arabs:</HI> the cause of the
vastness of <HI>Gran Cairo</HI> is, that there are three Cities incorporated into
one, that is, old <HI>Memphis, Babylon,</HI> and <HI>Elkhaire;</HI> for there was another
City hard by, called <HI>Babylone,</HI> but by encrease of Trade, and new
concourse of people, the <HI>Soldans</HI> and <HI>Mammalucks</HI> reduc'd all three to
one entire City: which would be a pittiful poor place, did not the
River of <HI>Nile</HI> give her a yearly visit from the Mountains of the
<PB N="385" REF="114"/>
Moon, about the Sommer Solstice, and retire again about eighty
dayes after.</P>
<P>We will now crosse the Greek Seas to Europe, and take a quick
view of most of those Cities, which are of the first magnitude; for
indeed, this <HI>Parallel</HI> aymes only at the <HI>Europaean</HI> Cities; And it will
be found by any impartial Reader, that <HI>London</HI> needs not vail to any
of them, if regard be had.</P>
<P>1. To conveniency of situation, and to salubrity of air.</P>
<P>2. To method of strict Government.</P>
<P>3. To magnificence of the chief Magistrates.</P>
<P>4. To Regulation of Trade.</P>
<P>5. To variety of Artisans.</P>
<P>6. To a greater number of Corporations and Halls.</P>
<P>7. To plenty of all Provision, that Air, Earth, or Water can af∣ford.</P>
<P>8. To Springs, Conduits, Aqueducts, and other conveyances of
fresh wholsome waters.</P>
<P>9. To the universality of Trafick, and bravery of the Adven∣turers.</P>
<P>10. To solidity, and richness of Commodities.</P>
<P>11. To Artillery, Ammunition, Docks, and a number of milita∣ry
stout well armed Citizens.</P>
<P>12. To (once) a glorious Temple.</P>
<P>13. To an admirable great Bridge.</P>
<P>14. To a noble Navigable River.</P>
<P>15. To a chearful and wholsome green circumjacent Soyl.</P>
<P>16. To Hospitality, and Festival publique meetings of Corpora∣tions,
and other Societies for encrease of love, and good intelligence
between Neighbors.</P>
<P>17. To number of Coaches by Land, and all sorts of Boats by
water, for the accommodation of Passengers.</P>
<P>18. For sundry kind of reliefs for the poor, and indigent.</P>
<P>19. For various kinds of honest corporal recreations and pastimes.</P>
<P>20. And lastly, for the number of humane souls. Many of these
may be found severally in other Cities, who may haply exceed
<HI>London</HI> in some particulars; but take them all together, she may vie
with the best of them, and run no great hazard.</P>
<P>But to proceed the more methodically in taking a view▪ to this
purpose, though short and cursory of the greatest Cities in <HI>Europe,</HI> we
will begin Eastward at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> called of old <HI>Bizantium,</HI> and
now <HI>Stambole</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> being the chief Court or Port, as they
terme it, of the <HI>Ottoman Empire,</HI> the word being derived from Faith
and Plenty: 'Tis true, she is plac'd in a fit, and advantageous posture,
to be Commandresse of the World, she was raised by a <HI>Constantine,</HI> and
lost by a <HI>Constantine</HI> (both of them, the Sonnes of <HI>Helens)</HI> about a
thousand years after; but touching her site, she hath on the one side,
the <HI>Pontus,</HI> or black Sea, and the <HI>Marmora,</HI> or <HI>Hellespont</HI> on the other:
the mouthes of which Seas are so narrow, that no passage can be for∣ced
<PB N="386" REF="115"/>
against the Castles, she is built upon the utmost levant point of
<HI>Europe,</HI> and hath all the vast Continent of <HI>Asia,</HI> before her from <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣tari;</HI>
Insomuch, that she stands almost in the Center of the old
World, and thereby, capable to send her Commands more speedily
to other Countries; yet since the discovery of <HI>America,</HI> the new
World, some modern <HI>Geographers</HI> balancing the parts of the old with
the new, they find that <HI>Rome</HI> stands more appositly to command the
whole Earth, because she is rather situated more towards the middle;
In some things 'tis confessed, <HI>Constantinople</HI> may claim the prece∣dence
of <HI>London,</HI> as first for the huge Palace of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which is
about three miles compasse; 'Tis thought also, she exceeds for num∣ber,
of humane Souls and Houses; yet in point of building, they are
but low, and cottage-like, nothing comparable to those of <HI>London.</HI>
And if you go to the <HI>quality</HI> of the Inhabitants, <HI>Constantinople</HI> may be
called but a nest, or banner of <HI>slaves;</HI> and herein, as in many other
of the particulars pointed at, before <HI>London</HI> hath the start
of Her.</P>
<P>We come now to <HI>Italy,</HI> and first to <HI>Rome,</HI> which though in circuit
she be yet about as big as <HI>London;</HI> yet in point of people, she may be
called a Wilderness, in comparison of her: She is also far inferior
for Traffique and Wealth; as also for temperature, and wholsom∣ness
of Air, that of <HI>Rome</HI> being not so healthy, which some impute
to the burning of stubble, for fertilizing the bed of the Earth; others,
to the ill-favour'd vapors that come from divers subterranean hol∣lowes
that remain up and down, out of the ruines of old <HI>Rome;</HI> for
<HI>Rome</HI> at present, may be called but a <HI>Skeleton</HI> of the old; or like a tall
man, shrunk into the skin of a <HI>Pygmey,</HI> being compared to that mon∣struous
stature she was of, in <HI>Vopiscus</HI> his time, who leaves it upon Re∣cord,
that she was fifty miles about, and had above four hundred
thousand free Citizens; and consequently, about four millions of
souls with in her bosome, as some infer; She then made the <HI>Ocean</HI> to
do homage unto the <HI>Tyber,</HI> she made <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Afrique,</HI> feudetaries to
<HI>Europe;</HI> but she who daunted the World, yielded to the Lawes of
<HI>Time,</HI> who gives all great Cities a space of growing, of subsistence,
and of declination; But a wonder it is, how so much of her is left,
considering, that from <HI>Brennus</HI> the <HI>Britain,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> she
was eight times sack'd, whence it may be inferr'd, that there is an
extraordinary providence, that seems to watch over her. For as she
subsisted before by the <HI>Pike,</HI> the <HI>Pen</HI> may be said now to support Her,
I mean her <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Courts, which causeth a great confluence of
people to resort thither, from all corners of the Earth: Insomuch,
that the number of strangers in <HI>Rome,</HI> may be said to exceed the num∣ber
of the Natives, because she is accounted the <HI>Communis Patria,</HI> and
chief Randezvouze of all Christians, in regard of the residence of the
chief Bishop, in whom every Catholique claimes an Interest: Inso∣much,
that <HI>Rome</HI> may be said to be more beholden to <HI>Shepheards,</HI> then
to any other profession; for as a <HI>Shepheard</HI> was her <HI>Founder,</HI> so a <HI>Shep∣heard</HI>
is still her <HI>Preserver.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="115"/>
The next City of the first magnitude in <HI>Italy,</HI> is <HI>Milan,</HI> which of
all other Towns, may be said to have this singularity, as to have no
Suburbs; 'Tis true, She may pretend much for Her <HI>Doure,</HI> her <HI>Citta∣del,</HI>
and <HI>Hospital,</HI> with number of excellent Artisans; yet who is well
acquainted with both places, will find that <HI>London</HI> is not much in∣ferior
to her, in any of these fower things; And for other particulars,
as ubiquitary Traffique, by Sea as well as Land, for multitude of
people, and divers other things, pointed at before, <HI>Milan</HI> comes short
of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the City of <HI>Venice,</HI> 'tis true, she hath many things to
glory of, as her wonderful situation, that she was born a <HI>Christian,</HI> that
she hath continued a <HI>Virgin,</HI> near upon thirteen hundred years, having
been never ravish'd by the assaults of any enemy, (though some out of
malice would make her a <HI>Concubine</HI> to the great <HI>Turk).</HI> She may also
glory of her great <HI>Arsenal,</HI> and that she hath the <HI>Sea</HI> for her <HI>Hus∣band;</HI>
yet if one go to multitude of Inhabitants, to the magnitude of
both Cities, to number of Corporations, with other particulars poin∣ted
at before, <HI>Venice</HI> will not disdain to vail to <HI>London;</HI> But touching
the last thing She glorieth of, <HI>London</HI> may claim as much interest in
the <HI>Sea</HI> as she, if regard be had to <HI>Maritime</HI> Dominion and Naval
power.</P>
<P>And lastly, while <HI>Venice</HI> is steeping and pickling in <HI>Salt-water,
London</HI> sports her self upon the banks of a fresh stately River, which
brings into her bosom, all the <HI>Spices</HI> of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> the <HI>Treasure</HI> of
the <HI>West,</HI> the Gems of the <HI>South,</HI> and the rich Furs of the <HI>North.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Naples</HI> 'tis confess'd, is a populous great Mercantile Town, and hath
three Castles, with handsom Buildings, and store of Nobility; but be∣sides
magnitude of places, and multitude of People, with other ad∣vantages
which <HI>London</HI> hath of Her, the <HI>Sun,</HI> whiles he doth as it
were broyl the <HI>Neapolitan,</HI> doth with the gentle reverberations of his
rayes, but guild the Walls of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Genoa,</HI> though she be a proud City, yet she stands not upon her own
legs, but she subsists most by the King of <HI>Spains</HI> money, by being a
Seal to convey it by <HI>Cambio</HI> to <HI>Flanders;</HI> and else-where, having little
of her own to trade withall; whereas <HI>London</HI> hath native substantial
Commodities of her own, and is far superior to her for bigness, and
number of souls, with other advantages.</P>
<P>Touching <HI>Florence,</HI> there is beauty enough to be seen there, but she
may partly thank <HI>London,</HI> that she is so fair, by the Trade she bears
to <HI>Ligorn,</HI> of late years.</P>
<P>Touching the rest of the Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> though they be ranked a∣mong
those of the first magnitude, yet they bear no proportion with
<HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Touching <HI>Sicily,</HI> there is <HI>Palermo,</HI> the residence of the Viceroy, a jol∣ly
neat City, which may glory of one thing, that neither <HI>London,</HI> nor
any other City in <HI>Christendom</HI> hath the like, which is a fair spacious
uniform street, of above a mile long; Next to which, is that of <HI>Eden∣burgh</HI>
<PB N="388" REF="116"/>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> extending it self in a direct line, from the Royal
Palace to the Castle.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Spain,</HI> there are divers large Cities of the first mag∣nitude,
as <HI>Barcelona,</HI> the metropolis of <HI>Catalonia; Saragossa</HI> the cape
City of <HI>Aragon; Valencia</HI> the chief of that Kingdom; <HI>Pampelona</HI> the
head of <HI>Navarr; Burgos</HI> the chief of old <HI>Castile,</HI> and <HI>Toledo</HI> of the
new; <HI>Murcia, Granada, Sevill,</HI> and <HI>Lisbonne</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> which is the
biggest of them all.</P>
<P>The two last are best peopled; but <HI>Madrid</HI> where the Catholique
Court is kept (though a <HI>Village)</HI> hath more then any of them; but all
these come short of <HI>London,</HI> in point of greatness, and populousness,
with divers advantages besides.</P>
<P><HI>Vienna</HI> the Imperial Court is of an extraordinary bigness, being
fenced about with <HI>English</HI> Walls, which <HI>Richard</HI> the first rear'd up
for his Ransome: It is also well peopled; so is <HI>Prague.</HI> Which though
the latter be made up of three Cities, yet they both come short of the
City of <HI>London</HI> in amplitude, and number of people, with divers o∣ther
properties mentioned before.</P>
<P><HI>Germany</HI> hath divers fair Cities, that may take place amongst
them of the first magnitude, as <HI>Mentz, Colen, Frankfort, Strasburg,
Norimburg, Auspurg, Magdenburg,</HI> and others, which though they beat
a Land Trade, being mediterranean Cities, and abound with wealth,
and numbers of Artisans, yet they are inferior to <HI>London,</HI> for many
respects.</P>
<P>Touching the <HI>Hans,</HI> and imperial Towns, there are divers of them
large, wealthy, and full of Trade, as <HI>Lubeck, Danzick,</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh</HI>
the biggest of them, which owes much of her prosperity to the Staple
of the <HI>London</HI> Marchant Adventurers, who are there setled; but
there's none of these Cities, though they be threescore more in
number, that will presume to compare with <HI>London,</HI> in any of those
twenty properties before mentioned.</P>
<P>Touching <HI>Copenhagen</HI> in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Stockholm</HI> in <HI>Swethland,</HI> they
come far short; nay, if you go more Northward, upon the white
Sea, as far as the gran <HI>Mosco</HI> the Emperor of <HI>Russias</HI> Court, which is
a huge woodden City, and inviron'd about with a treble wall to stop
the incursions of the <HI>Tartar,</HI> you will find it inferior to <HI>London,</HI> in eve∣ry
of those twenty particulars.</P>
<P>Touching Low <HI>Germany,</HI> or the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> which is one of the
greatest Countries of Commerce in Christendom; 'tis true, there
are there many Noble Cities. Among others, the City of <HI>Gant</HI> in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> which for bigness, bears the Bell of all the Cities of <HI>Europe,</HI>
being computed to be twenty miles in circuit, which makes the <HI>Fle∣mins</HI>
twit the <HI>French,</HI> by saying <HI>Nous auons un Gant qui tiendra Paris
dedans,</HI> We have a <HI>Glove</HI> (meaning <HI>Gant,</HI> which is a Glove in <HI>French)</HI>
that will hold <HI>Paris</HI> within it; yet for number of humane souls, this
great City is but a kind of Desart, being compared to <HI>London. Ant∣werp</HI>
is a Noble City, both for her Cittadel, and Fortifications, which
are so vast, that two Coaches may go abrest upon the Walls; She
<PB N="389" REF="116"/>
may compare with any other City, she was in former times, one of
the greatest Marts, this side the <HI>Alps:</HI> Insomuch, that <HI>Guicciardin</HI> re∣ports,
that after the <HI>Intercursus Magnus</HI> was established betwixt <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
and the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> the Trade 'twixt <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> came
to above twelve Millions yearly; But upon the Revolt of the Con∣federate
Provinces from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> when Secretary <HI>Walsingham</HI>
told <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that he would give both the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI>
King such bones to gnaw, that might shake both their teeths in their
heads; meaning thereby, the Revolt of the <HI>Hollander</HI> from the one,
and the kindling of the <HI>Ligue</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> I say, when these tumults be∣gan,
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> may be said to have risen up out of the ruines of
<HI>Antwerp,</HI> which Town is come, in lesse then fourscore years, and by
a stupendous course of Commerce and Negotiation, to be one of the
greatest Marts of the World, being before, one of the meanest Towns
of the first magnitude in <HI>Holland;</HI> but she is swoln since, twice if
not thrice as big as she was: Insomuch, that she may be said to give
the Law to all the rest of the united Provinces, and to smell rank of a
<HI>Hans Town,</HI> or little Common-wealth of her self. Among other cau∣ses,
this may be imputed to the Trade of the East and West Indies,
which is appropriated unto Her, and to a mixture with the Jewes,
who have there two Synagogues: yet is this fresh great Mercantile
Town, much inferior to <HI>London,</HI> almost in all things.</P>
<P>First, in point of populousness, as may be conjectured out of her
weekly Bills of Mortality, which at the utmost, come but to about
threescore a week; whence may be inferred, that <HI>London</HI> is five times
more populous; for the number that dies in Her every week, comes
commonly, to near upon three hundred.</P>
<P>Secondly, in point of Wealth, <HI>Amsterdam</HI> comes short of <HI>London;</HI>
for when Sir <HI>Ralph Freeman</HI> was Lord Mayor, it was found out by
more than a probable conjecture, that He, with the 24. Aldermen,
his Brethren, might have bought the Estates of one hundred
of the richest Bourgemasters in <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> Then, for sweet∣nesse
of Site, and salubrity of Air, she is so far inferior to
<HI>London,</HI> that her Inhabitants may be said to draw in Fogs,
in lieu of free Air, the Countrey being all marsh and moorish about
Her; so that <HI>Amsterdam</HI> is built as it were in a bog, or quag; for in
their fabriques, they are forced to dig so deep for a firm foundation,
by ramming in huge Piles of Wood, that the Basis of a House, doth
oftentimes cost more then the superstructure.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Amsterdam</HI> hath neither Conduit, Well, or Fountain
of fresh water within her, but it is brought to her by Boats; and they
wash with Rain water, which every House preserves in Cisterns, to
that purpose.</P>
<P>Touching the River of <HI>Texel,</HI> that brings her in all Commodities
she is nothing comparable to the <HI>Thames,</HI> in point of security of sayl∣ing,
or sweetness of water: touching the first, they say there stood a
Forrest of Wood in times past, where now the <HI>Texel</HI> makes her bed,
which could not be cut down so clean, but there are divers ill favoured
<PB N="390" REF="117"/>
Trunks, and stubs of Trees, still found under water, which is a great
annoyance to Ships.</P>
<P>There are in the United Provinces, many jolly Towns besides,
which may be ranked among them of the first magnitude, especially
<HI>Utrecht,</HI> which hath the face of an ancient stately Town, &amp; subsists more
by her self: the rest grow great, and flourish in Wealth, Buildings,
and People, by having some peculiar staple-Commodity appropria∣ted
unto them, as <HI>Amsterdam</HI> hath the Trade of the East and West
Indies assigned Her, (as was formerly mentioned). <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> hath the
Staple of <HI>English</HI> Cloth; <HI>Dort,</HI> of the <HI>Rhenish-Wine,</HI> and <HI>Corn</HI> that comes
from <HI>Germany; Haerlam</HI> hath a Charter for <HI>Weaving</HI> and <HI>Knitting;
Leyden</HI> is an University; The <HI>Hague</HI> subsists by the residence of the
<HI>Hoghen Moghen,</HI> the Councel of State; <HI>Middleburgh</HI> in <HI>Zeland,</HI> by the
Staple of <HI>French</HI> Wines; <HI>Trevere,</HI> by the <HI>Scots</HI> Commodities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
but none of these bear any proportion with the City of <HI>London,</HI> who
trades in all these several Commodities together, and hath particu∣lar
Corporations accordingly, with many more.</P>
<P>We will now hoyse up Sayl for <HI>France,</HI> which also hath divers Ci∣ties
of the first Magnitude, as <HI>Rouen</HI> in <HI>Normandy, Bourdeaux</HI> in <HI>Gas∣cogny,
Tholouse</HI> in <HI>Languedock,</HI> with the other five Courts of Parlia∣ment;
as also <HI>Amiens</HI> in <HI>Picardy,</HI> and the City of <HI>Lions,</HI> and <HI>Marseilles:</HI>
the one whereof, subsists by her <HI>Bank;</HI> the other, by being the chief
Arsenal of the <HI>French</HI> Gallies; but none of these will offer, I think,
to compare with the City of <HI>London,</HI> nor any of those Towns that
stand upon the <HI>Loire,</HI> whereof there are many gentile ones.</P>
<P><HI>Paris</HI> I confess, may be capable of some Comparisons with <HI>London,</HI>
for which she hath many helps, as being a <HI>Citè, Vil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>é &amp; Universitè,</HI> a
<HI>City,</HI> a <HI>Town,</HI> and an <HI>University;</HI> as also the chief residence of the <HI>French</HI>
Kings, and the Parliament.</P>
<P>But lets go a little to particulars. And first, to the populous∣ness
of both Cities; They say in <HI>Paris,</HI> that the Parishes of Saint <HI>Eu∣stace,</HI>
and Saint <HI>Innocent,</HI> have above one hundred thousand Commu∣nicants
in them alone: and that by the last Cense that was made there,
was near upon a million of humane souls, found in the City and Sub∣urbs
of <HI>Paris.</HI> It may be so, but we shall find in the ensuing Discourse
that <HI>London</HI> hath more.</P>
<P>Secondly, for magnitude: 'tis true, that <HI>Paris</HI> hath the advantage
of an <HI>Orbicular</HI> figure, and so is more capacious. But by the judgement
of those Mathematicians, who have observed both Cities; if <HI>London</HI>
were cast into a Circle, she would with all her dimensions, be alto∣gether
as big as <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the <HI>Loure,</HI> 'tis true, that it is a vast fabrick, and the like
is not found in <HI>London;</HI> but it is the only Court the French King hath
in <HI>Paris,</HI> whereas in <HI>London</HI> there are fower Royal Seates, with two
Parks annexed to one; I hope the <HI>Bastile</HI> will not offer to compare
with the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> nor the River of <HI>Seine</HI> with the <HI>Thames;</HI> much
lesse I believe, will <HI>Paris</HI> offer to make any comparisons with <HI>London,</HI>
in point of Traffique, and Societies of Noble adventuring Marchants,
<PB N="391" REF="117"/>
who trade on both the Hemispheres; nor of her Provost with the
Lord Mayor of <HI>London.</HI> I allow <HI>Paris</HI> to have rich <HI>Banquiers,</HI> but they
are most of them strangers, and not Natives.</P>
<P>Moreover, I think <HI>Paris</HI> would be loth to compare with <HI>London</HI>
for neatness of streets, or for sweetness of site; for <HI>Paris</HI> hath scarce
any verdure about her, but the <HI>Proclere;</HI> whereas <HI>London</HI> hath most
delightful Fields round about Her, of a deeper greene, not so fading
as that of <HI>France:</HI> and touching streets, the dirt and crott of <HI>Paris</HI> may
be smelt ten miles off, and leaves such a tenacious oily stain, that it is
indelible, and can never be washed off; 'tis confessed, that <HI>Paris</HI> hath
waters of a singular vertue, for the die of Scarlets; but 'tis as well
known to the World, what extraordinary Vertues the <HI>Thames</HI> water
hath for many things. Ask the <HI>Hollander,</HI> and he will tell you, there
is no such water to fatten Eeles, and all sorts of Fish. <HI>Thames</HI> water Beer
bears the price of Wine, in many places beyond the Seas. And the
<HI>Portugalls</HI> have found of late, such vertue in that water, that they car∣ry
it away by whole Tuns, to <HI>Lisbon.</HI> I might enlarge my self further,
in shewing what advantages the City of <HI>London</HI> hath of <HI>Paris,</HI> but I
will suspend my Discourse till I proceed a little further, only I will
conclude this Paragraffe with this one Objection, that <HI>London</HI> hath far better blood in her Veins, then <HI>Paris,</HI> I mean a greater number of
wholsom Springs, Conduits, Aqueducts, and Sources of sweet waters,
whereof <HI>Paris</HI> hath not so many. And now there comes into my me∣mory,
a facetious passage, between <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>4th,</HI> and the <HI>Provost</HI> of
<HI>Paris,</HI> touching those waters; which happened thus. The King had
appointed the <HI>Suisse</HI> Ambassadors, whereof there were many in Com∣mission,
to be lodged in the City, and that plenty of the best
Wines should be provided for them; The Ambassadors having lain
long upon the <HI>Parisians,</HI> and drunk daily very deep, and being at
last dismissed. The <HI>Provost</HI> made an humble Remonstrance to the
King, how the City had so long time win'd the Suisse Ambassadors,
and their numerous retinue, which put Her in some Arreares, there∣fore
he humbly prayed, in the name of the City, that his Majesty
would be pleased to give leave, that a small Tax might be laid for
a while upon the Water-pipes and Cesterns of fresh Waters, for the
discharge of those Arrears for Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The King pleasantly an∣swered,
<HI>Ventre de Saint Gris,</HI> there must be some other way found out
to do this; for <HI>'Twas our Saviour only, that could turn water into Wine,
therefore he would not presume to attempt it.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus rambled up and down the World, and cast some few
glances upon the most renowned Cities; and having pointed before,
at twenty properties, wherein <HI>London</HI> may well compare with any of
the greatest Cities in <HI>Europe,</HI> we will now more particularly, treat a
little of those properties, and take them all single, as they are
ranked.</P>
<P>1. The first is, Conveniency of Situation, and salubrity of Air,
wherein the wisdom of the old <HI>Britains</HI> our Ancestors, in point of E∣lection
of the place, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the benignity of the Heavens, in point of
<PB N="392" REF="118"/>
influences and temperature, have made <HI>London</HI> as happy as any other
City under the vast Canopy of the Heavens; some say, that that Ci∣ty
is best situated, which resembleth a <HI>Camels</HI> back, who hath protu∣berancies,
and bunches, so a City should be seated upon rising
grounds, or small Hillocks; It is the posture of <HI>London;</HI> for she is
builded upon the flanks, sides, and tops of divers small Hillocks,
lying near the Banks of a Noble River, and being encompassed about
with delightful green Medows, and Fields on all sides; and she is in
so fair a distance from the Sea, that no danger of forren invasion can
surprize her, but she must have notice before: The nature of her Soyl
sandy, which is wholsomest for Habitation, and conduceth much
goodness of Air, the barrenness whereof, is made prolifical by
art.</P>
<P>2. Touching the second property, which is a method of strict, and
punctual Government, ther's no City goes beyond her, or indeed e∣qualls
her, take night and day together; for there is not the least
misdemeanor, or inconvenience that can be; but there be Officers in e∣very
corner of the City to pry into them, and find them out; but es∣pecially,
the <HI>Wardmote Inquest,</HI> which are to be men of repute, and
known integrity; They by vertue of their Office inquire, if any man
outlawed, or indited of Treason, or Felony, lurk within the Ward;
They inquire if the publique peace be any way disturbed, or broken;
They enquire of all offences, and dammages done to the River of
Thames, and make a speedy presentment of them to be redressed;
They inquire after Riotors, dissolute persons, and Barrators, walking
by nightertayle, without light at unseasonable houres. They inquire
after those that play at unlawful Games. They inquire after Potours,
Panders, and Bawds, common hazardors, Champartors, maintainers
of quarrels, or embracers of Inquests. They inquire after Witches,
Strumpets, common Punks, and Scolds. They inquire after hot houses,

inquire, if any Forrainer buy and sell with any other Forrainer, within
they City or Suburbs thereof, any Marchandizes or Goods, to the preju∣dice
of the Natives.</P>
<P>They inquire, if every Freeman which receiveth, or taketh benefit of
the Franchises of the City, but continually dwelling out of it, hath not,
nor will not pay scot and lot after his Oath made, nor be partner to
<PB N="393" REF="118"/>
the common charges of the City, when he is required. They inquire,
if any conceal the Goods of Orphans, whose Ward and Ma∣riage
belong to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen. They inquire,
if any Officer, by colour of his Authority, do extortion to any man,
or be a promoter, or maintainer of quarrels against right, or take car∣riage,
and arrest victual unduly. They inquire, if any Boat-man, or
Ferriman take more then is due for his Boat-hire.</P>
<P>They are to inquire, if any pourprestures be made upon the com∣mon
ground of the City by Land, or water, as in Walls, Pales, Stoops,
Grieces, Doores, or Cellars; or if any Porch, Pent-house, or jetty be

that Pentises, and jetties, be at least the heighth of nine feet,
and that the Stalls be not but of two foot and a half in breadth, and to
be flexible, and moveable, <HI>viz.</HI> to hang by Jewmews or Garnets, so
that they may be taken up, and let down. They are to inquire, if any
common course of water be forclos'd, or letted to the noyance of the

or Ale above a peny a quart, and small Ale above a half peny. They
are to inquire in Shops and Houses of Chandlers, and others which

that none do sell by <HI>Venice</HI> weights. They are to inquire, if any In∣holder
do bake Bread to sell within his own House; and if any Baker

<PB N="394" REF="119"/>
and above the prizes set by the Lord Mayor. They are also, to inquire

<P><PB N="395" REF="119"/>
The Ward-mote Inquest, by vertue of their Office, are bound to
search into all these enormities, and to meet once a moneth, or oftner,
if need require to that purpose. And whosoever doth judiciously ob∣serve
these several heads, will find, there's nothing wanting to pre∣serve
a City, or the people thereof in the wayes of neatness, safety, and
industry, or for the advancement of Vertue, and suppression of
Vice.</P>
<P>By these particulars, with what hath bin spoken of formerly, in the
Body of this Book, the Reader may observe, how exact the City of
<HI>London</HI> is in her <HI>Urban</HI> Government.</P>
<P>3. Now touching the magnificence, gravity, and state of the chief
Magistrate: neither the <HI>Pretor</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> or the <HI>Prefect</HI> of <HI>Milan;</HI> neither
the <HI>Proctors</HI> of Saint <HI>Mark</HI> in <HI>Venice,</HI> or their <HI>Podestas</HI> in other
Cities; neither the <HI>Provost</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> the <HI>Markgrave</HI> of <HI>Antwerp,</HI>
can compare with the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of <HI>London:</HI>
If one go to the variety of their Robes, sometimes Scarlet richly fur'd,
sometimes Purple, sometimes Violet, and Puke. What a goodly
Spectacle it is to behold the Lord Mayor, and the Companies atten∣ding
him in so many dainty Barges, when he goes to be sworn in
<HI>Westminster-Hall;</HI> and what brave shews there are attending him by
Land, at his return? what a plentiful sumptuous Dinner, consisting
of so many huge Tables, is provided for him? what a variety of do∣mestick
Officers wait upon him perpetually, whereof, with the <HI>Re∣membrancer,</HI>
there are five of them Esquires by their places, as was
hinted before? what a comely sight it is to see the Lord Mayor, She∣riffs,
and Aldermen, going in their Robes upon Festivals to the Ca∣thedral
Church of Saint <HI>Pauls,</HI> though they who stand not so well af∣fected
to the present Government, say, that he goeth in now at the
<HI>wrong end</HI> of the Church: what a goodly sight it is, when he goeth
upon <HI>Easter</HI> Holidayes, to the <HI>Spittle,</HI> with the Sword, and Cap of
Maintenance going before him? How his Robes are fitted for the sea∣son,
as from <HI>Michaelmas</HI> to <HI>Whitsontide,</HI> he weares <HI>Violet</HI> fur'd; from
<HI>Whitsontide</HI> to <HI>Michaelmas, Scarlet</HI> lined: And for distinction among the
Aldermen, they who have bin Lord Mayors, have their Cloaks lined
with changeable Taffata; but those that have not, with green Taffata;
what great places of trust are committed to the Lord Mayor, as the
keeping of the great Bridge in repair, which hath such large Reve∣nues
belonging unto it, with a particular stately Seal, which of old,
had the Effigies of <HI>Thomas of Becket,</HI> (a <HI>Londoner</HI> born) upon it, with
this Inscription in the name of the City.</P>
<P><HI>Me quae te peperi, ne cesses, Thoma, tueri;</HI> But the Seal was altered in
<HI>Henry</HI> the eighths Raign: what a great trust is it for the Lord Mayor
to have the conservation of the Noble River of Thames, from <HI>Stanes</HI>
Bridge, till She disgorgeth her self into the Sea? How stately is he
attended, when he goes to take a view of the River, or a Swan-hop∣ping?
and lately, what a Noble addition was it for the Lord Mayor
to have a Park of Deer of his own so near the City, to find him sport,
and furnish him with Venison? what an Honour is it for the Lord
<PB N="396" REF="120"/>
Mayor to be accounted the <HI>first</HI> man of <HI>England,</HI> upon the death of the
Soveraign Prince. As when King <HI>Iames</HI> was invited to come, and take
the Crown of <HI>England; Robert Lee,</HI> Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> was the
first man who subscribed, and then the Officers of the Crown, with
the chief Noblemen after him. The Recorder of <HI>London</HI> also, is <HI>pri∣mus
Consiliarius Angliae,</HI> and is priviledged to plead within the Barre.
The Lord Mayors of <HI>London</HI> have bin called sometime, to sit at the
Councel Table, as Sir <HI>Iohn Allen</HI> was in <HI>Henry</HI> the eighths time, with
others, (which <HI>Allen,</HI> gave that rich Collar of Gold, which the
Lord Mayors use to wear) and the Aldermen his Brethren, were used
to be called <HI>Barons.</HI></P>
<P>4. We are come now to <HI>Regulation</HI> of Trade, wherein <HI>London</HI> is not
inferior to any City whatsoever, witness (among others) what pru∣dential
Lawes, Restraints and Cautions the <HI>Marchant Adventurers,</HI>
who trade in the Golden Fleece of <HI>England, viz.</HI> in Woollen Manu∣factures,
have propos'd to themselves, as likewise all other Corpora∣tions
in like manner, for the improvement of that particular Trade,
and preserving it from confusion.</P>
<P>5. Touching variety of <HI>Artisans, London</HI> yields to no other, 'tis
true, that mingling with <HI>Forreiners,</HI> hath much advantag'd her in this
kind; but 'tis observed, and confessed by all Nations, that though
the <HI>Londoners</HI> be not so apt to invent; yet when they have got the
Invention, they use alwayes to <HI>improve it,</HI> and bring it to a greater
<HI>perfection.</HI></P>
<P>6. Touching Corporations, Halls, Fraternities, Guilds, and Soci∣eties,
<HI>London</HI> hath not her Fellow: witness the twelve Honourable
Companies; out of one of which, the Lord Mayor is yearly chosen.
The several Societies of those, who venter abroad in all parts of the
habitable Earth, as far as the Antipodes. And threescore Companies
of Citizens besides; whereunto the new Company of <HI>Coachmen,</HI> is
lately added, who have their Halls, their regular Orders, and Officers
accordingly; And touching all sorts of Artificers, and variety of in∣dustrious
wayes to improve all kind of Manufactures, and thereby gain
an honest Livelihood, and so enrich the place. <HI>London</HI> may be called
a <HI>Hive of Bees,</HI> (as formerly was touched) or a <HI>Hill of Ants,</HI> which
have bin alwayes made the Emblems of industry, and pro∣vidence.</P>
<P>7. Touching plenty, and abundance of all kinds of Provision, as
Flesh, Fish, Fowle, Fruits, Fuel, variety of Drinks, and Wines, with
any other Commodity, that conduceth to pleasure and delight, as
well as necessity, <HI>London</HI> may glory to be as well served, as any Ci∣ty
under Heaven. A knowing <HI>Spaniard</HI> said, that he thought <HI>Eastcheape</HI>
Shambles alone, vends more Flesh in the year, then all the Court of
<HI>Spain. Gascon</HI> Wines drink better in <HI>London,</HI> then in <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and
so do all other, provided they be not sophisticated. Nor doth <HI>London</HI>
abound with all things so plentifully, for the <HI>belly</HI> alone, but also for
the <HI>back,</HI> either to keep it warm, or make it gay; what varieties of
woollen Stuffs there are in every Shop, with broad Cloth equal to the
<PB N="397" REF="120"/>
price of Silk, being come to that heighth of perfection, that some hath
bin made of ten pounds a yard in price; But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and o∣thers,
have now got the art of making our Stuffs and Cloths, by those
foolish giddy headed Puritans that pretended to fly for persecution of
their Consciences, whereby they have done their own Countrey no
little mischief in this particular, as in many things besides.</P>
<P>But in point of plenty, it may be well avouch'd, that no <HI>Oppidan</HI>
Magistrates on Earth, go beyond the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and the
two Sheriffs, for constant Hospitality all the year long: The time
was, that the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> feasted four Kings at once. Inso∣much,
that of all other places in the Iland, those Verses of <HI>Michael,</HI>
the <HI>Cornish</HI> Poet, may be most verified of <HI>London.</HI>
<Q>Nobilis Anglia, pocula, prandia donat, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>8. Concerning wholsom, clear waters, as 'twas said before that
<HI>London</HI> hath good blood in her Veins, by those many Aqueducts, Con∣duits,
and conveyances of fresh waters, to serve for all uses, so she
hath good Veins in her Body, by those rivulets, Springs, and Sources
she hath within and about Her▪ What an Herculean work was that,
to bring the River of <HI>Ware,</HI> to run through her streets, and refresh all
her Houses. And what an ingenious fabrick is lately rear'd up in the
Thames, to furnish the <HI>Strand, Drury Lane,</HI> the <HI>Convent Garden,</HI> and
all the new Houses thereabouts, with convenient proportions
of fresh water.</P>
<P>9. For <HI>Universality of Trade,</HI> there is no Countrey upon the Sur∣face
of the Earth, no Seas that any of the Winds blow upon from
the <HI>Artick</HI> to the <HI>Antartick</HI> Pole, from the rising to the setting Sun,
but <HI>London</HI> by her Navigations, findes them out, and so barters, and
brings all kind of Commodities; what goodly Vessels doth she send
forth, to crosse the Line to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> to <HI>Italy,</HI> and the bottom of
the <HI>Streights,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> Dominions: As also to the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, how she
flyes ore the vast <HI>White</HI> Ocean, to <HI>Moscovy,</HI> and to hunt the great
<HI>Leviathan</HI> in <HI>Groenland.</HI></P>
<P>How her Marchants and Factors are more reputed, and have grea∣ter
priviledges every where, then any other, particularly in the huge
Hause City of <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and <HI>Rotterdam, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>10. In point of solid and useful Wares she hath of her own,
what a substantial Commodity, and of what high esteem, all the
World over is her <HI>Cloth,</HI> her Kersies, and divers other kinds of Wool∣len
manufactures; together with her <HI>Lead</HI> and <HI>Tin,</HI> how she turns the
first to Silk, and Cloth of Tissue, the last to Gold and Silver; what
rich returns she makes of her Fish, from all the Catholick Countries?
What large Ware-house, and spacious fair Shops she hath of all
mercantile Commodities? And touching her Royal Exchange, those
of <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> have but baubling Pedlery Wares, in com∣parison
of hers. Insomuch, that a wager was offered once to be laid,
<PB N="398" REF="121"/>
that <HI>Crashawes</HI> Shop alone, was able to buy all those in the <HI>Busse</HI> at
<HI>Amsterdam.</HI></P>
<P>11. For strength defensive and offensive, for Arms of all sorts, for
Artillery, Ammunition, for Arsenals and Docks on both sides the
River, for Castles and Block-houses, <HI>&amp;c. London</HI> is not inferior to a∣ny;
She hath twelve thousand Trained-Band-Citizens, perpetually
in a readiness, excellently armed; which when Count <HI>Gondamar</HI> saw
in a Muster one day in Saint <HI>Iames</HI>'s Fields, and the King asking him
what he thought of his Citizens of <HI>London;</HI> He answered, That he
never saw a Company of stouter men, and better Arms in all his life∣time;
but he had a sting in the Tayl of his discourse; for he told the
King, that although his Majesty was well pleased with that sight at
present, he feared, that those men handling their Arms so well, might
do him one day a mischief, which proved true; for in the unlucky
Warres with the long Parliament, the <HI>London</HI> Firelocks did him most
mischief.</P>
<P>In times passed, the City of <HI>London</HI> hath sent out strong
Fleets to scoure, and secure the four Seas from depredations, and Py∣racy.
And if in the year 1293. she was able to set forth a Fleet of
ninety five Ships, as it stands upon Record, what would she be able
to do now, if she were permitted?</P>
<P>Moreover, If in King <HI>Stephens</HI> Raign, as another Record hath it,
she raised 60000. Foot, and 2000. Horse for Land Service, how
many more were she able to do now in case of necessity, that being
compared to what she was then, were to compare a Gyant to a
dwarf? But besides these several kind of strengths, and Arms, there's
no place so well furnish'd with <HI>Amonition de bouche,</HI> as the <HI>Frenchman</HI>
hath it, with munition for the mouth, <HI>viz.</HI> with Magazines of <HI>Corn,</HI>
and Arms against Famine, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>London</HI> is; for besides that at <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI>
and the <HI>Bridge-house,</HI> how many Halls have Store-houses of this
kind?</P>
<P>There's no place also better armed against the fury of the fire; for
besides the pitched Buckets that hang in Churches and Halls, there
are divers new Engines for that purpose. But it had bin wished, that
the Proclamations of the two last Kings for building with <HI>Brick,</HI> had
bin observed by <HI>London,</HI> for besides that, it had made Her lesse sub∣ject
to casual fyrings, it had conduced much to the beauty of her
Streets, and uniformity of Structure.</P>
<P>12. For healthful corporal Recreations, and harmless passe-times,
<HI>London</HI> may go in the Van, to any place that I ever saw yet. Go and
walk in her Fields, you shall see some shooting at long marks, some at
Buts; some bowling upon dainty pleasant Greens, some upon Bares;
some wrestling, some throwing the Barre, some the stone, some jump∣ing,
some running, some with their Dogs at Ducking ponds; some
riding upon Nags, some in Coaches to take the fresh Air, some at
Nine-pins, some at Stool-ball, though that stradling kind of Tomboy
sport be not so handsome for Mayds, as Forreiners observe, who hold▪
<PB N="399" REF="121"/>
that dansing in a Ring, or otherwise, is a far more comely exercise
for them.</P>
<P>Within the City, what variety of Bowling Allies there are, some
open, some covered? there are Tennis Courts, Shuffle-Boards, playing
at Cudgels, Cock-fightings, a sport peculiar to the <HI>English;</HI> and so is
Bear, &amp; Bull-baytings, there being not such generous Dogs, and Cocks
any where else.</P>
<P>Go to the River, what a pleasure it is to go thereon, in the Summer
time, in Boat or Barge? or to go a <HI>floundring</HI> among the Fishermen?
There was in former times a sport used upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> which is
now discontinued: it was for two Wherries to row, and run one
against the other, with staves in their hands; flat at the fore-end;
which kind of Recreation, is much practised among the <HI>Gondolas</HI> of
<HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>The time was, that Stage-playes, and Fencing, were much used in
<HI>London:</HI> The History speaks of a Play, <HI>Anno</HI> 1391. performed by the
Parish Clarks of <HI>London,</HI> at the <HI>Skinners Well,</HI> besides <HI>Smithfield,</HI> which
continued three several dayes: the <HI>King, Queen,</HI> and the Court be∣ing
present.</P>
<P>And of another, in the year 1409. which lasted eight dayes, the
subject was touching the Creation of the World, whereunto the
Court, and Nobility were invited: But those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind of Stage-playes,
were turned after to Tragedies, Comedies, Histories, and Enter∣ludes;
for representing whereof, there were more theaters in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
then any where else; And it was a true observation, that those
comical, and tragical Histories, did much improve, and enrich the
<HI>English</HI> Language, they taught young men witty Complements, and
how to carry their Bodies in a handsome posture: Add hereunto, that
they instructed them in the stories of divers things, which being so
lively represented to the eye, made firmer impressions in the me∣mory.</P>
<P>Lastly, They reclaimed many from Vice and Vanity; for
though a Comedy be never so wanton, yet it ends with vertue, and
the punishment of vice.</P>
<P>13. For a stately <HI>Cathedral Temple,</HI> and <HI>Dome</HI> of devotion, the time
was, that <HI>London</HI> did not yield to any City under the Sun in this par∣ticular;
Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> Church being esteemed by all Nations, to be one
of the eminentest, and visiblest Temple, one of the most glorious
Piles of Stones under Heaven; taking all the dimensions, together with
the chearful conspicuous <HI>Site</HI> thereof, being near the Center of the
City, and upon a rising ground; Being also founded upon <HI>Faith's,</HI> by
having a large Church of that name truckling, as one may say, un∣der
her Chancel; Add hereunto, what a comfortable Object it was,
to behold above twenty miles distance, round about, this goodly
Structure, raysing it self above the rest, and serving as it were for a
<HI>Crest</HI> to the whole City; But now this famous Fabrick, which was
accounted the greatest glory of <HI>London,</HI> is become her greatest shame;
For many Fortainers, (who are none of those that place any inherent
<PB N="400" REF="122"/>
Sanctity in senseless inanimat stones) have bin overheard to say, that
<HI>Pauls Church</HI> in that posture she now is, is the saddest sight, and most
ruthful Spectacle upon the Surface of the whole Earth; nay, some
have bin heard to say, that whereas a <HI>Stable</HI> became once a <HI>Temple</HI> in
<HI>Palestine,</HI> a Temple among us hath bin made a Stable; nay, they
went further, not sticking to say, that as <HI>Christ</HI> was born in a <HI>Stable,</HI> so
<HI>Antichrist</HI> is like to be born in a Stable in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The time was, that <HI>London</HI> was used to have a greater care of this
<HI>Temple,</HI> when a solemn <HI>Act</HI> of the Lord Mayors, and Common Coun∣cel
passed, which stands yet upon good Record, to this effect, and
stands still in force.</P>
<P>Forasmuch as the material Temples of God were first ordained for the law∣full
and devout Assembly of people, there to lift their hearts, and lawd and
prayse Almighty God, and to hear his Divine Service, and his holy Word, and
Gospel, sincerely said, sung, and taught, and not to be used as Markets, and
other prophane places, or thorow faires, by carriage of things: And for that
of late years, many of the Inhabitants of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and other
people repairing thither, do commonly use, and accustom themselves
very unseemly, and unreverently (the more the pitty) to make their common
carriage of great Vessels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of Ale and Beere, great Baskets full of Bread,
Fish, Flesh, and Fruit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d such other things, Fardels of Stuffe, and other
grosse Wares, and things, through the Cathedrall Church of Saint <HI>Pauls,</HI> and
some in leading Moyles, Horses, and other Beasts, through the same unreve∣rently,
to the great dishonour, and displeasure of Almighty God, and the
great grief also, and offence of all good people, Be it therefore for remedy
and Reformation thereof, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dained, enacted, and established, &amp;c. That no
person, either fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e or forren, of what estate or condition soever, do at any
time from henceforth, carry or convey, or cause to be carried, and conveyed
through the said Cathedrall, any manner of great Vessel, or Basket with
Bread, Ale, Beer, Fish, Flesh, or any other like thing or things, upon pain
of forfeiture, or loosing, for every such his or their offence, three shillings four
pence; for the second, six shillings eight pence; for the third, ten shillings;
And for every other offence, after such third time, to forfeit ten shillings, and
to suffer two dayes and two nights imprisonment, without Bayl or Mainprize,
The one moyety of all which pains and penalties, shall be to Christs Hospital
within <HI>Newgate,</HI> and the other half, to him that will sue for the same, in a∣ny
Court of Record within the City, by Bill, original Complaint, or Informa∣tion,
to be commenc'd, or sued in the name of the Chamberlain of the said City
for the time being, wherein no Essoyne, or wager of Law, for the Defendant
shall be admitted, or allowed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the Reverence, that <HI>London</HI> shewed her Cathedral
Church, not long agoe, which may be said, to look now like the hulk
of a great weather beaten Ship, that had cross'd the <HI>Line</HI> eight times,
forward and backward, to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> and lies rotting upon the
Carine: such is the condition of this stately Church, which is like to
be buried shortly in her own ruines, and so become a heap of rubbish;
<PB N="401" REF="122"/>
and then how <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld London</HI> will look, let them judge, who have taken
a judicious prospect of Her.</P>
<P>Moreover, there's another Reason, that may induce <HI>London</HI> to
prevent this; for if <HI>Pauls</HI> were down, She forfeits the name of a <HI>City;</HI>
for all Lawyers concur in this opinion, that there can be no <HI>City,</HI>
without a <HI>Cathedral Church;</HI> t'is but a <HI>Village</HI> without one, or a <HI>Town</HI> at
most: therefore <HI>London</HI> hath great cause to wish, that those unlucky
Scismaticks had never bin born, who first brought <HI>Pauls</HI> Church to
this pittiful passe; for it may well be said, that all those casual fires
which she suffered, (whereof there were many) did not do her as
much mischief, as the faruous fires of some fanatical Zelots have
done; as one said also of the <HI>House of Peers,</HI> that the <HI>Long Parliament</HI>
was more destructive unto it, then the <HI>Powder-plot</HI> had bin, if it had
taken effect.</P>
<P>Touching particular appropriated places for the service of God.
We know there were such from the beginning. As soon as <HI>Noah</HI> got
footing on dry ground, he erected an <HI>Altar,</HI> which was in liue of a
Church, the Patriarks had theirs; then from <HI>Altars,</HI> they came to
have <HI>Arks,</HI> and ambulatory <HI>Tabernacles;</HI> and we read, what a conceit
of holiness was carried towards them: Then <HI>Salomon,</HI> by Instructi∣ons
from Heaven, did build a fix'd, and standing material <HI>Temple;</HI>
And we well know, how highly our Saviour himself was incensed
against the money changers, and others, who prophan'd that place;
and what sharp reprehensions his Apostle gave afterwards to those,
who used to eat and drink in those places which were appointed for
devotion.</P>
<P>That <HI>Hyper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> or room, where our Saviour did please to celebrate
the Passe-over, and institute his last Supper, may well be thought to
have more Sanctity in it, then an ordinary Chamber, considering
how many holy things were done there afterwards; for our <HI>Saviour</HI>
appeared in that very place, twice after his Resurrection; the <HI>Holy
Ghost</HI> came down in cloven tongues in that place. <HI>Iames</HI> was created
<HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and seven <HI>Deacons</HI> were elected in that place,
which in regard of so many holy transactions, was enlarged, and
made afterwards a goodly <HI>Church,</HI> long before <HI>Constantine:</HI> whosoever
is versed with the <HI>Primitive Fathers,</HI> knowes well how often they
speak of <HI>Peculiar places,</HI> set apart to celebrate divine service; as also of
<HI>set times,</HI> and that the posture must be <HI>Eastward;</HI> Among the primi∣tive
Christians, those places were called by some, <HI>Basilica;</HI> by others,
<HI>Dominica,</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> whence the <HI>German</HI> word <HI>Kerk,</HI> was derived; by
others, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, by some they were termed <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
by others, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which were but Synonyma's to
<HI>Churches,</HI> or holy Oratories.</P>
<P>One of the <HI>first Fathers</HI> saith positively, that <HI>Churches</HI> were in the
<HI>Apostles</HI> time.</P>
<P>Another saith, they continued from the <HI>Apostles</HI> time, to <HI>Constan∣tine,</HI>
with whom the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> came to be <HI>Christian</HI> first.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="123"/>
And in all the ten Persecutions, which happened by intermissions,
we may read, how that by the Edicts of the Emperors, the Oratories
or Churches of the Christians, were to be in some places burnt, in
others, demolished. And in the last persecution under <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> the
History saith, that a great number of ancient Edifices, and Churches
of the Christians were destroyed; And observable it is, that one of
those Primitive Fathers, compares the <HI>Churches on the shore, to safe Har∣bors
in the Sea,</HI> which surely must be interpreted, to relate to the <HI>Pla∣ces,</HI>
and not to the <HI>persons</HI> only.</P>
<P>Histories also speak plainly, how in the first and second Century
after Christ, in the <HI>persecution</HI> that was in <HI>Persia,</HI> many goodly <HI>Orato∣ries</HI>
and <HI>Churches</HI> of the Christians were destroyed.</P>
<P>By these short disquisitions into the Ages of the World and Histo∣ry,
it appears, that among the Patriarks, there were <HI>holy places</HI> that
had an Analogy with Churches, which continues among the <HI>Iewes</HI>
ever since: And touching Christians, there were Oratories, and ap∣propriate
sacred places, from the very infancy of the Gospel, which
served as a general Rendezvouz to celebrate Divine service all along
from the Apostles time, through the three Centuries of the Primi∣tive
Church: therefore they must be possessed with a strange spirit of
contradiction, and prophaness, who make no account of those peculiar
Houses, which pious devout souls have appropriated, rea'rd up, and
dedicated to the sole service of Almighty God, but hold all places
promiscuous, and indifferently proper for that use.</P>
<P>It may justly be doubted, whether such sordid poor narrow souls,
who so malign the beauty, the holiness, and decencies of Gods House
here in the Church <HI>militant,</HI> will ever be admitted to behold the glory
of the Church <HI>Triumphant.</HI></P>
<P>And now, having presumed to speak so much of <HI>Londons</HI> great
Temple (than which there is not a more conspicuous Object upon
Earth, except the Mount <HI>Olympus,</HI> which is said to bear up Heaven);
and having with a true sense of sorrow set forth the sad condition
thereof; my prayers are, that it would please God to put it into the
hearts, and move the spirits of those worthy Patriots, who are now
assembled to mend all breaches in the Common-wealth, to propose
some way for preserving this ancient great visible Ornament from
tumbling down: And there is a fair opportunity offered to this pur∣pose;
for if those irregular New Buildings be questioned (whereof
there are by computation, above a hundred thousand pop'd up with∣in
these forty years), It would, most humbly under favour, be very
proper to employ part of the Tax upon those Houses, to repair Gods
House.</P>
<P>14. Touching a Noble <HI>Bridge,</HI> and a Navigable <HI>River,</HI> spoken of
before, <HI>London</HI> is not inferior to any other City whatsoever: concer∣ning
the first, what a large Rent hath it to preserve it self? what a
vast Magazine of Corn is there alwayes in the Bridge-house, against
a dearth? what a number of Officers, that look to the reparations
<PB N="403" REF="123"/>
thereof, are handsomly maintained thereby, and some of them per∣sons
of good quality?</P>
<P>Touching the second, the River of <HI>Thames</HI> hath not her fellow, if re∣gard
be had to the straightness and length of her course running
from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West,</HI> without many meanders, her convenient distance
from the Sea, to prevent surprizals, the chearfulness of the Soyl on both
sides, the wholsomness of her water, which makes the best Beer in the
World, &amp; is transported by forrein Nations for other uses; the variety
of her Fish, the fatness of her mud; If regard be had also to those For∣rests
of Masts, which are perpetually upon her, the variety of smaller
Woodden bottoms plying up and down, the stately Palaces that are
built on both sides of her banks so thick, which made divers forrein
Ambassadors affirm, that the most glorious sight in the World (take
water and land together) was to come upon a high Tide from <HI>Graves∣end,</HI>
and shoot the Bridge to <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>15. For number of humane souls, breathing in City and Suburbs;
<HI>London</HI> may compare with any in <HI>Europe,</HI> in point of populousness:
the last Cense that was made in <HI>Paris,</HI> came under a million; but in
the year 1636. King <HI>Charles</HI> sending to the Lord Mayor, to make a
scrutiny, what number of <HI>Roman Catholiques</HI> and <HI>Strangers,</HI> there were
in the City, he took occasion thereby, to make a Cense of all the
people; and there were of Men, Women, and Children, above seven
hundred thousand that lived within the Barres of his jurisdiction a∣lone;
and this being one and twenty years passed, 'tis thought, by all
probable computation, that <HI>London</HI> hath more by the third part now,
then she had then. Now, for <HI>Westminster,</HI> and <HI>Petty France,</HI> the <HI>Strand,
Bedford Berry,</HI> St. <HI>Martins Lane, Long Acre, Drury Lane,</HI> St. <HI>Giles</HI> of the
Field, High <HI>Holborn, Grayes Inne Lane,</HI> St. <HI>Iones,</HI> and St. <HI>Georges street,
Clarken well,</HI> the out-lets of <HI>Red</HI> and <HI>Whitecrosse-street,</HI> the out-lets be∣yond
the Barres of <HI>Bishopsgate, Aldersgate,</HI> and <HI>Southwark</HI> Barres, beyond
the <HI>Tower, &amp;c.</HI> take all these places, with divers more, which are conti∣guous,
and one entire peece with <HI>London</HI> her self, I say, take all these
Buildings together, there will be found by all probable conjecture, as
many Inhabitants at least, as were found before within that compass,
where the point of the Lord Mayors Sword reacheth, which may a∣mount
in all, to a million and a half of humane souls: Now, one
way to know the populousness of a great City is, to observe the Bills
of Mortality, and Nativities every week. I think, there is no such
Custom in <HI>Paris;</HI> but for <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> which is a very populous Mer∣cantile
place, the ordinary number there, of those that go weekly out
of the World, is but fifty, or thereabouts, and about so many come
into the World every week; But in <HI>London,</HI> the common Weekly
Bills come to near upon 300. that come in, and about so many that go
out of the World, though the last years general Bill made twice as
many to go out, as came in; for it gives account of fourteen thousand
and odd that dyed, and but seven thousand christened; but this may
be imputed (the more's the pitty) to the confusion of Sectaries, which
swarm since the long Parliament, as <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> and others who use
<PB N="404" REF="124"/>
not to christen their Children, a sad story to tell, so that there were
many thousands born, which were not baptized, and whereof the Bill
speaks not.</P>
<P>Touching the form and shape of <HI>London,</HI> it may be aptly compa∣red
to a <HI>Lawrel leaf,</HI> which is far more long then broad; and were
<HI>London</HI> round, as <HI>Paris</HI> and other Cities are, she would appear more
populous, by a more often encounter of the passengers.</P>
<P>Concerning the length of <HI>London,</HI> take all Buildings that are conti∣guous
one to another from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West,</HI> from the utmost point of <HI>West∣minster,</HI>
to the utmost point beyond the Tower, she may be well
thought to be near upon five <HI>Italian</HI> miles in <HI>longitude,</HI> and about half
so much in <HI>latitude,</HI> and in Circuit, above twelve miles. 'Tis true,
that the Suburbs of <HI>London</HI> are larger then the Body of the City,
which make some compare her to a <HI>Iesuites Hat,</HI> whose brims are far
larger then the Block, which made Count <HI>Gondamar</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Ambassador to say, as the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> was discoursing with
him, upon his return from <HI>England,</HI> of the City of <HI>London.</HI>
Madam, <HI>I believe there will be no City left shortly; for all will run out
at the Gates to the</HI> Suburbs; <HI>and for the</HI> Men, <HI>I think they are gone by this
time into the Country, for I left them all booted and spur'd when I came
away.</HI></P>
<P>But touching the amplitude, and largeness of <HI>London,</HI> whereas
<HI>Charles</HI> the Emperor, to put a Complement upon <HI>Paris,</HI> said, that
she might be called a <HI>Province,</HI> rather then a <HI>City,</HI> this term may bet∣ter
befit <HI>London,</HI> who is a <HI>County</HI> of her self.</P>
<P>16. From proportions and <HI>quantity,</HI> we will now go to the <HI>quality</HI>
of the persons she hath produced from time to time: whereof there
have been great numbers of most gallant and generous, most wealthy
and worthy, most eminent and munificent brave men, who had souls
as large as their substance, I mean such that received, either their first
being, or well being from Her.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Quint</HI> was used to glory, that he was a Citizen of <HI>Ghent,</HI>
having bin born there.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> in answer to a Letter of the King of <HI>Spains,</HI> where∣in
he had enumerated above a score of Soveraign Titles, stiled
himself only <HI>Henry, Roy de France, &amp; Bourgeois de Paris.
Henry</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and Burgesse of <HI>Paris.</HI> But <HI>London</HI> hath greater
cause to glory in this point, for <HI>Constantine,</HI> the first Christian Empe∣ror,
a <HI>Britain</HI> born, was her Child. And a foul mistake it was in Him,
who writ the Book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> when in his Epistle Dedicatory he
saith, that <HI>Constantine</HI> was the Son of <HI>Helena,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Woman,
(being pure <HI>British);</HI> for the name of <HI>English</HI> was not then in the
World, nor did the <HI>Saxons,</HI> whence the <HI>English</HI> are derived, take foot∣ing
in great <HI>Britain,</HI> but a long time after.</P>
<P><HI>Maud</HI> the Empress was also a <HI>Londoner</HI> born, with divers other
great Kings and Princes.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Becket,</HI> a man very famous in all the Catholick Countries,
<PB N="405" REF="124"/>
and held one of the highest Saints, was born in <HI>London;</HI> he was first
one of the Sheriffs Clarks, then he was Parson of St. <HI>Mary Hil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> then
he went to <HI>Bologna</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> to study the Law; and at his return, he was
made Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> and Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> Innu∣merable
other great Clarks, and eminent Bishops, were born in <HI>Lon∣don;</HI>
and of late times, Bishop <HI>Lancelot Andrews,</HI> who for his vast
stock of learning, might be called, the <HI>Universal Bishop.</HI> There are now
living, two great Luminaries of the Church, Doctor <HI>Wren,</HI> and
Doctor <HI>Warner,</HI> born both in <HI>London,</HI> the one Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> the other
Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> a person of most acute Intellectuals, and of rare
excellent knowledge.</P>
<P><HI>Fabian</HI> the famous Chronologer was Sheriff of <HI>London,</HI> and born
there; what a number of most munificent Benefactors hath <HI>London</HI>
had among her <HI>own Natives,</HI> besides those whom she bred; what a
Noble useful Structure is <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> built at the sole charge of Sir
<HI>Simon Eyre</HI> Draper, and Lord Mayor of <HI>London?</HI> what a worthy
Foundation is St. <HI>Iohns</HI> Colledge in <HI>Oxford,</HI> built by Sir <HI>Thomas White,</HI>
Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> who was Benefactor also to <HI>Bristoll, Reading,</HI>
and above <HI>twenty Towns</HI> besides? what a bountiful Benefactor was Mr.
<HI>William Lambe,</HI> free of the Company of <HI>Clothworkers?</HI> what a world of
charitable deeds, did he do in Town and Countrey? what a Noble
soul had Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham</HI> Mercer, and Marchant, who built the
<HI>Royal Exchange, Gresham Colledge,</HI> with another great Countrey Pa∣lace
in <HI>Middlesex;</HI> what a notable Benefactor, was Mr. <HI>Thomas Howel,</HI>
bred in his youth in <HI>Spain,</HI> and afterwards in <HI>London,</HI> who was one of
the greatest Benefactors of the Company of <HI>Drapers,</HI> and, besides ma∣ny
other large acts of charity, he hath left such means to <HI>Drapers</HI> Hall,
that if any Mayden can derive her self from the right linage of <HI>Howel</HI>
in <HI>Wales,</HI> the said Hall is to give her 21 <HI>l.</HI> towards her portion; and
this to continue for ever; what a free large Soul had Mr. <HI>William Iones,</HI>
Marchant, and free of the <HI>Haberdashers,</HI> who in <HI>Monmouth,</HI> the Coun∣trey
where he was born, did build a fair <HI>Free School,</HI> with very large
allowance to the Masters; he was Benefactor also to <HI>Hamborough,
Stoad,</HI> and divers other places at home and abroad. To these two <HI>Bri∣tains,</HI>
we will add a third, which is Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton,</HI> Goldsmith;
what a hazardous, expenceful mighty work, did he perform, in
bringing <HI>Ware</HI>-River to run through the streets of <HI>London?</HI> what an
infinite universal benefit doth accrue thereby, to the whole City and
Suburbs? how often did this great design take heat and cold, what
faintings and fears, what oppositions did it break through, before it
was perfectly finished?</P>
<P>What a large noble Soul had Sir <HI>Baptist Hicks,</HI> Lord Vicount
<HI>Campden?</HI> what a number of worthy things did he in his life, and at
his death, both for the advancement of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Iustice?</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Campden,</HI> in the County of <HI>Glocester,</HI> he repaired, and adorned
God Almighties House, and reard another for the poor, before he
built any for himself; He founded also there, a very commodious
<HI>Market-house,</HI> and having done many things more for the publick
<PB N="406" REF="125"/>
good in that place, he erected afterwards, a stately Palace for his
Posterity, though the hard fate of the times, and the fury of the
Warre hath half destroyed it: He was also a great Benefactor to the
Churches, and the poor of <HI>Hamsted,</HI> and <HI>Kensinton,</HI> to St. <HI>Bartholomewes,</HI>
and <HI>Christ-Church</HI> Hospitals in <HI>London,</HI> to all the Prisons; as also to St.
<HI>Laurence</HI> Church in the old <HI>Iury:</HI> He purchased divers <HI>Impropriations,</HI>
and bestowed them upon the Church in divers counties; He was at
the charge of erecting a convenient <HI>Session-house,</HI> for the Justices of
<HI>Middlesex</HI> to meet, in the middest of St. <HI>Iohn's street,</HI> which is called
<HI>Hicks Hall,</HI> and will so be called to all posterity. All these great
lights he carried before him, and at his death he gave a World of
Legacies, and divers Pensions to pious Ministers and others, and be∣queathed
a great sum to be distributed among all his Servants.</P>
<P>To speak of all those Noble <HI>Londoners,</HI> who have done glorious
things, both for Church and State, in point of piety, stately Structures
of divers natures, for the publick good, and deeds of charity, would
make a large Volume of it self. I will conclude for the present, with
a late worthy man, one Mr. <HI>Iohn Walter,</HI> who was Clark of <HI>Dra∣pers
Hall,</HI> who, having resolved with himself, when he had attained a
competent subsistence for himself and his Children, to employ the
rest every year, for charitable uses, which he did constantly for many
years: He built two Hospitals near <HI>London,</HI> and it was a great while
before the Founder of them was known. He used to send a proporti∣on
of bread to be distributed among the poor, to divers Churches; and
it was not known, who sent it, till he was dead, and that he was mis∣sing.
It is thought by a computation that was made, that he had em∣ployed
above ten thousand pounds to charitable uses of all sorts, pri∣vate
and publick, and he was so free from vain-glory, that his greatest
care was to do them in such a manner, that his left hand should not
know what his right hand did; And in his study after his death, there
was a bag of 800 <HI>l.</HI> in Gold, with a label in paper upon it, <HI>This is none
of mine, but the poor's.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, for Prerogatives, Enfranchisements, Immunities, Char∣ters,
and Liberties, for Hospitality, and plentiful treatments; as also
for Antiquity, the City of <HI>London</HI> comes not in the arrears to any.</P>
<P>Touching the last, 'tis true, there are some Cities in the East, that
have the start of her in point of time, yet <HI>London</HI> was built 354 years
before <HI>Rome,</HI> which is a fair Age.</P>
<P>Touching the second, some call <HI>London,</HI> a <HI>lick-peny,</HI> (as <HI>Paris</HI> is
called by some, a <HI>pick-purse)</HI> because of feastings, with other occasions
of expence and allurements, which cause so many unthrifts among
Countrey Gentlemen, and others, who flock into her, in such exces∣sive
multitudes; but this must be imputed not to the place, but to
the persons; for one may live in <HI>London</HI> as frugally, if he hath wit
to make use of it, as in any other City whatsoever.</P>
<P>T'is true, that the prizes of all things use to be enhanc'd by conflu∣ences,
and swarms of people, which a judicious Forreiner observing
in <HI>London,</HI> said, that she bore no proportion with the Iland, but might
<PB N="407" REF="125"/>
serve a Kingdom thrice as big, and that <HI>England</HI> may be rather said,
<HI>to be in London, then London in England,</HI> which made some compare
her to the <HI>spleen,</HI> whose over-swelling, make the rest of the body lan∣guish;
but it might be answered, that <HI>London</HI> is rather like the <HI>sto∣mack,</HI>
which digests the wealth of the Land, and after a good con∣coction,
disperseth it again in wholsom nutriment to all parts.</P>
<P>Touching the third, <HI>viz.</HI> freedom and immunities, there's no City
hath more.</P>
<P>In the Raign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, it was enacted, That the Citi∣zens
of <HI>London</HI> were to enjoy their priviledges, and franchises, <HI>licet usi
non fuerint, vel abusi fuerint,</HI> whether they were not us'd or abus'd,
notwithstanding any Statute to the contrary, as the Lord <HI>Coke</HI>
hath it in his <HI>Institutes.</HI></P>
<P>In the Lawes of the Land, <HI>London</HI> is called sometimes <HI>Camera Re∣gis,
Reipublicae Cor, &amp; totius Regni Epitome,</HI> the Kings Chamber, the
heart of the Common-wealth, and compendium of the whole King∣dom;
sometimes she is called <HI>Caput Regum &amp; Legum,</HI> The head of
Kings, and of Lawes; nay, some of the Roman Emperors in their E∣dicts,
called her <HI>Augusta,</HI> which is a name alwayes of magnificence
and State.</P>
<P>And now will I take leave of the Noble <HI>Augusta,</HI> or City of <HI>London,</HI>
concluding with this hearty wish, couch'd in these two Hexameters,
and relating to her proportion, or shape, which is a <HI>Laurel leaf,</HI> as
formerly was said.
<Q><L>Londinum Lauri folio non impare formâ,</L>
<L>Flore at Urbs, sicut Laurus, semper{que} virescat:</L></Q>
<Q><L><HI>London</HI> is like a Laurel leaf, may She,</L>
<L>Be verdant still, and flourish like the Tree.</L></Q></P>
