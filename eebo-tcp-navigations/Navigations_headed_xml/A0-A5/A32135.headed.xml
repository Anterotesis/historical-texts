<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He last time I was in this place I minded you to make what speed you could to raise Forces to reduce the ty∣ranising people, which will not obey my command to a Loyall subjection, the same I shall now include, for I a∣bove all things in the world prize the peace and safety of my good Subjects, and of all Rebellion J hate that of the Popish Faction, I heare daily of the wo∣full estate of my People, and doe under∣stand how my House of Commons
<PB REF="3"/>have passed a Bill for the raising of For∣ces, and that the Bill stickes with you my Lords, for whach I give you no thanks, as to the Declaration, J have no pleasure in that, but that Actions may be transacted, in matter of such conse∣quence, this is the full effect of the Speech.</P>

<P>They are marched within 4. Miles of <HI>Dublin,</HI> pillaging of Houses, and dri∣ving away Cattell, and stop the passa∣ges
<PB REF="3"/>from whence they received provisi∣on, to the great griefe and feare of his Majesties good Subjects, the Protestants of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Rebels made publique proclemation, and maintained it, with a generall Oath for to be all true to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> also they proclaime and confesse that King <HI>Charles</HI> is their lawfull King and governour, making a Vow and Protestation.</P>
<P>They tooke up Armes in defence of their Religion, not in contempt or malice against his Maiesty, to which intent they spake to the Lord <HI>Dillon,</HI> to send Letters to the Kings Majesty, but this can be no better dissem∣blation, for they which love the King will not persecute his Loyall people by fire and Sword, as they have and daily doe, and yet will make us be∣lieve they love the King, <HI>from their pow∣er Lord keepe him for ever,</HI> and never let him be so unfortunate as to fall into their
<PB REF="4"/>hands, for then upon my life J am per∣swaded they would exile from their hearts both duty, love, and mercy, two Sunnes must not shine in one climate, <HI>Tyrone</HI> must have nothing to doe where King <HI>Charles</HI> hath Authority.</P>
