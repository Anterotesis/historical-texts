<P N="2">2 That all Gentlemen and other per∣sons inhabitants of the realme, or straun∣gers, hauing high Iustice in all or in part, of their owne in propertie, or during their liues, or else such as doe fully possesse roy∣alties in <HI>Normandy,</HI> may in the same pla∣ces where they haue the saide Iustice and royalties, and in such places as they shall thinke most conuenient as well absent as present, haue and cause to be vsed the said exercise of their religion, as wel for them∣selues, their householde and tenaunts, as for all other that will resort thither.</P>
<P N="3">3 As for other Gentlemen, hauing no
<PB REF="3"/> such highe Iustice: that they may vse the same exercise of the religion in their hou∣ses for themselues and their houshold. So as they doe not dwell in the townes, bo∣roughes, or paryshes of the sayde Lordes that haue high Iustice (sauing such as be his Maiesties) or else with the sufferaunce or lycence of the sayde Lordes of highe Iustice. Which it may please his Maie∣stie to order that by his example the same licence may not be refused. And shall not suffer them to be reproched or blamed as breakers of his Edict, if there resort to the sayd exercise of religion any other persōs than of their owne housholde, or y<SUP>t</SUP> if there happen any christning that requireth hast.</P>
<P N="4">4 That in all townes and places where the exercise of the sayde religion is nowe vsed, the same may so continue. And to ac∣commodate the reast of the Prouinces of this realme with the same exercise of the religion, that in thrée townes of the same Prouinces and gouernments to be na∣med in the sayde Edict, the exercise of the religion shall be vsed for all persons that will resort thyther.</P>
<P N="5">5 That the Quéene of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> the
<PB REF="3"/> Princes and Princesses of the bloud, and the principal officers of the crowne, being at the Court, may vse the sayde exercise of the religiō, in y<SUP>e</SUP> lodgings of their traines.</P>
<P N="6">6 That vnder the name of the exercise of the religion may be comprised all actes appertayning as well to the ministery, or∣dring, and discipline, as also to the publike and priuate teaching of children &amp; others.</P>
<P N="7">7 As for Churchyardes, for the buriall of the deade, that the Lordes of high Iu∣stice, Maiors, Aldermen, and officers of the places where the sayde exercise of the religion shall be permitted, may thereof consider and take order. And in other pla∣ces they shall get some place to burie the deade, and therein to haue the assistance of the kings officers.</P>
<P N="8">8 That in all Vniuersities and schooles, all persons may be indifferently receiued, whether it be to teach or to study, and not to be questioned withall, or forced for the matter of religion.</P>
<P N="9">9 That al pore and sick folkes shal also be receyued into the Hospitals &amp; other like houses, and haue part of all publike alme∣ses, and be vsed with lyke indifferencye,
<PB REF="4"/> being of the one religion or the other.</P>
<P N="10">10 That those of the sayde religion shall not be chalenged for their mariages, be∣ing in the degrées not forbidden by the lawes receyued in this realme.</P>
<P N="11">11 That the lymits of .x. leagues men∣tioned in the article touching the exercy∣sing of the religion forbidden at <HI>Paris,</HI> as vncertaine, may at the least be chaunged into the Prouostie and Viscontie. In the which if it so please his Maiestie, to com∣maunde it absolutely, he shall not néede to be further pressed, to haue the exercise of the religion there. But if that shall not please his Maiesty: yet that it may please him to moderate somewhat the straight∣nesse of this commaundement, and not to take awaye from all Lordes of highe Iustice, the generall licence giuen vnto them, to vse the exercise of the sayde reli∣gion, some of them hauing chiefe Lord∣ships within the sayde Prouostie and Vi∣contie, which shall be named vnto him by the sayde Deputies. This to be done as well on the behalfe and fauour of the said Lordes, as of a great number of people that otherwise shal be without heauenly &amp;
<PB REF="4"/> spiritual foode, or else shal be to much trou∣bled in going farre, to haue it farre of, but chiefly for the christning of their children.</P>
<P N="12">12 And as touching that which (next vnto the conscience) is most déere vnto all persons, that is, the honor and goodes, and to lay a sure foundation in that which shal be for this cause ordred, to the ende there be no doubt made of the sinceritie of the Quéene of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> of the Princes of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and of <HI>Conde,</HI> the father and the sonne, according to the assurance gi∣uen to his Maiestie of their part, that all y<SUP>t</SUP> which hath bene done in these warres, was done for a good meaning, and for the zeale of their religion: his sayde Maiestie shal declare y<SUP>t</SUP> he doth take thē for his good Cosins, faythfull subiects and seruauntes, as in lyke case he doth take and estéeme the Lordes, Knightes, Gentlemen, Cap∣taines, officers, and other inhabitants of the townes and Boroughs of this realme and countries of his obeysance, who haue folowed, succoured, and holpen them in the saide warres, in what place or sort soeuer the same hath bene, to be his good and faithfull subiects and seruaunts. And
<PB REF="5"/> for like good and reasonable occasion, his Maiestie shall declare that he doth take the heyres of the late Duke of <HI>Deux∣pontes,</HI> the Princes of <HI>Orange,</HI> Counte <HI>Ludouic</HI> of <HI>Nassau</HI> his brother, and <HI>Vol∣rode</HI> Counte of <HI>Mansfeld,</HI> to be his good Cousins, neighbors, and friends.</P>
<P N="13">13 And to shew himselfe to be so in déede towards the sayde persons: he shall order that the sayde Princes of <HI>Nauarre</HI> and <HI>Conde,</HI> shall enioy those lands belonging to them, which haue bene taken from them, and are in the handes of the king of <HI>Spaine.</HI> Or else for lack of satisfaction to be made by the sayde king of <HI>Spaine,</HI> the King shall giue them letters of Mart.</P>
<P N="14">14 Also his Maiestie shall effectuallye cause the sayde Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and Countie <HI>Ludouic</HI> of <HI>Nassau</HI> his brother, to be restored and put in possession, in the principaltie of <HI>Orange,</HI> rightes, landes, and iurisdictions of the same, and all that therevnto belongeth, and also in other lands, Lordships, and iurisdictions, which they haue in his realme and obeysance. Of which principaltie, one parte of the places haue bene taken by the <HI>Sieur</HI> of
<PB REF="5"/> <HI>Suse</HI> Knight of the order, and some o∣ther places haue bene seazed by the kings letters patents for his seruice. And that the sayd Prince and Counte his brother, may from henceforth enioye the same, as they did before the troubles, and as it is expressed in the treaties of peace, made betwéene the late king Henry of Fraunce and the king of Spaine, and other proui∣sions and declarations sithence graunted for the behoofe of the saide Prince: Not∣withstanding all procéedings, sentences and orders, made and giuen during the troubles, which shall be as nothing, and of none effect or force.</P>
<P N="15">15 He shall also cause to be restored ef∣fectually to the sayd noble mē, all the wri∣tings, titles and documents, rents, fruits, and reuenues appertayning to them, ta∣ken in the time of the present troubles, as∣well in the sayd principalitie, as in the landes of his maiestie, the same to be exe∣cuted by the Commissioners, at the tyme of the execution of the Edict of pacificati∣on, or by such other of the kings officers, as the sayde noble men will choose.</P>
<P N="16">16 And his Maiestie meaning to re∣paire
<PB REF="6"/> all things happened in the tyme of these warres, as much as he can: his ma∣iestie will giue order that al prisoners and such as haue bene stayed by iustice, and o∣therwise sent to y<SUP>e</SUP> Galleys vpon occasion of these troubles, shall be set at lybertie on eyther part, without paying any raūsome. And as for the Raunsoms alreadie payde, there shall nothing thereof be recouered.</P>
<P N="17">17 And whereas variaunce may hap∣pen to aryse vppon occasion of sales of landes and other immouable goods, and engaygings made vpon occasion of raun∣soms, before y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke of <HI>Aniou</HI> the kings brother, (calling vnto him the Mareschals of Fraunce) to be by him decyded and en∣ded: It may be ordered that all persons, aswell of the one Religion as of thother, reciprokely, and whome it toucheth, shal enter agayne into all their immouable goodes, which they did possesse before the sayde troubles, and that haue fallen vnto them during the same. And as for their mouable goodes which shall be founde to remayne, the same shall be restored vnto them purely &amp; simply: &amp; so shall also such as haue bene taken betwéene neighbours
<PB REF="6"/> and neighbours, and deliuered in trust to be kept. And as for suche as haue béene solde by order of Iustice, they shall haue them agayne, paying the same price that they were solde for. And yet neuerthe∣lesse such as haue béene taken by way of hostilitie, shall remaine as good prise, and not to be brought againe in question.</P>
<P N="18">18 All they also of the said religion shall recouer all offices of iustice, of reuenues and other, togither with the benifices wherevnto they haue any interest, to en∣ioy them wholy and peaceably, and also al offices of dignities, gouernements, cap∣tainships, charges, or pensiōs which they had before the sayde troubles, except it be that they were constrayned to resigne thē by the kinges Edict made in that behalfe. In which case they shall restore the profite which they shall haue thereof in déede re∣ceyued, as likewise they of the sayde reli∣gion do offer of their part to be a meanes for the whole restitution of their sayde of∣fices and benifices, to reuoke and recouer from them to whom through the necessity of the warres, they haue solde the tempo∣rall reuenue of the Cleargie, the king
<PB REF="7"/> graunting vnto them suche letters and commissions as shall be requisite for that purpose.</P>
<P N="19">19 That all procéedinges, sentences, iudgements, and definitiue or interlocu∣tory decrées, giuen against anye of them of the religion, of what sorte or condi∣cion so euer they be, as well deade as li∣uing, whether they haue borne armes or not, at the beginning, since, and during the troubles, and by occasion of the same, till the day of the sayde Edict, shall be broken, reuoked, and made voyde, and so also all executions, if there haue béene any, and all markes, tokens, and monuments, of the said slaunderous executions against their persons, and the remembraunce of them, taken away with such solemnitie as is re∣quisite for the full reparation and recoue∣rie of their honor. And the places where the sayd executions haue bene made, to be established in their first state, and restored to the owners of the same. And as for ci∣uill procéedings and processes, the parties to be put in their first state as they were before the troubles.</P>
<P N="20">20 All prescriptions happened during
<PB REF="7"/> the sayd troubles shall be voide, and taken as though they had not happened, and no meanes left whereby any of eyther reli∣gion may helpe themselues therewith a∣gaynst other.</P>
<P N="21">21 And for the better establishing of the peace for the tyme to come, and to take a∣way all inequalities, and a like good vsage to be shewed equally to all the kings sub∣iectes: all those townes that be or haue béene kept by those of the sayde religion, shall be vsed with like equalitie as the o∣thers be, and not to be grieued and ouer∣charged with lones, garrisons, or anye o∣ther burthens, and the inhabitauntes of them and of others of this realme being of the religion, or that shalbe thereof here∣after, shall be indifferently admitted to all offices, dignities, charges, and publike functions, and called also to all counsels and determinations, in towne, houses, or in generall offices of Prouinces.</P>
<P N="22">22 That all places, townes, and Pro∣uinces shall remaine and enioy the same priuileges, exemptions, lyberties, and franchises, which they did before the saide troubles.</P>
<P N="23"><PB REF="8"/>23 That the king shall extend the beni∣fite of his Edict of pacification (in such sort as he doth to all his owne subiects, and to those that be vnder his obedience and pro∣tection) to those that be of the countie of <HI>Venisse,</HI> and of the Archbishopricke of <HI>A∣uignon,</HI> as being within his realme, and within the compasse or circuite of hys crowne, at the least for the restitution and enioying of their goodes, the libertie of their consciences, their sure habitation and frée accesse and trading within hys realme, and within the sayd Countie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed Archbishoprike, as the kings own and na∣turall subiects doe and may doe: And this for the reasons that haue béene more at large set forth to the <HI>Sieurs de Biron</HI> and <HI>de Malassize,</HI> &amp; specially for the pre∣seruation of the kings right and authority in the sayd Countie and Archbishoprike.</P>
<P N="24">24 That althoughe the Reyters who haue béene called to the succor of those of the religion at their great néede, and who be yet with them, ought to bée payde by such as haue béene the first and principall authors of this warre, and that haue coū∣selled and in maner constrayned the king
<PB REF="8"/> therevnto, and since also to continue ther∣in, notwithstanding the earnest and con∣tinuall instance made by them of the reli∣gion for the peace, and namely since the ioyning with them of the sayd late Duke of <HI>Deuxponts:</HI> Yet neuerthelesse for a∣uoyding of these contentions, and not to omit one onely poynt of all meanes pos∣sible for them, they of the sayde religion offer to contribute towards the sayd pay∣ment, the summe that the king shall vn∣derstand by hys said Commissioners. And for the doing of y<SUP>e</SUP> same they offer the first part of the reuenue of all those that be of the religion, and that they maye be after that rate taxed and coated according to their vocations and liuing, as it is accu∣stomed, vntill the summe which shall be declared, shall be perfourmed, deducting onely from the same reuenues the ordina∣rie charges, and forbearing the execu∣tion till the next yeare, bicause the fruites of this present yeare shall scarcely suffice for the entertainment of the said Reyters. And the said taxation or coting to be made vpon them that be of this realme onely.</P>
<P N="25">25 That all letters of pardon and of ab∣holishments
<PB REF="9"/> graunted by the king, eyther generall or particular, for matter happe∣ned before and during the troubles for the cause of religion, shall haue theyr full force and effect, and shall be executed by the Commissioners for this Edict of Pa∣cification.</P>
<P N="26">26 That the Quéene of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> the Princes of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and <HI>Conde,</HI> the fa∣ther and the sonne, the Lords, gentlemen, officers and others, that haue ayded and succoured them in their warres, shall re∣maine quit and discharged of all money that hath béene by them, or by their order taken &amp; leuied of the receipts &amp; reuenues of the king, to what summe soeuer the same doth amoūt vnto, as also of townes commonalties, and of rents, reuenues, &amp; treasories, of the sale of moueable goodes, as well of the Church as of others, that are come of the sale of the kings timber, woodes, alienation of the temporaltie and reuenues of the Church, of forfeytures, bootyes, raunsoms of prisoners, &amp; of any other summes of money, of what nature soeuer, by them or by their knowledge and consent taken, vpō occasion of these wars

And to this ende, that all things done by the knowledge and consent of the sayde late Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> or of the said Quéene of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and the other Prin∣ces, shall be sufficient for all warrant and discharge.</P>
<P N="27">27 And for as much as in the distribu∣ting of Iustice (whereof doth chiefly de∣pend the suretie of this Edict of pacificati∣on) diuers abuses haue bene commytted, which procéeded of the passion and partia∣litie of the most part of the Iudges, a∣gainst those of the religion: therefore to preuent the lyke dealing, and that from one warre there be not an entry made to an other more intollerable for them, vn∣der colour of Iustice, the proces of those of the religion, both ciuill and criminall, as well on the behalfe of the plaintife as of the defendant, shall be treated &amp; heard
<PB REF="11"/> at the first, before the ordinary Iudges, and after, vpon appeale, before certaine others to be taken of all the bodyes of the saide Courts of Parliaments, as the par∣ties shall accorde and agrée vpon, to a cer∣taine number by which according to these particuler orders of the sayde Courtes of Parliament, iudgement may be giuen, sauing where the parties cannot agrée, within one onely and that a short delaye, then the sayde processe shall be iudge in the high councell, being called therevnto foure maysters of the requestes of the number of those that the king shall ap∣poynt, for the matter that shall be deliue∣red by those of the religion.</P>
<P N="28">28 As for the assuraunces, that it hath pleased the king of himselfe voluntarily to graunt vnto them of the religion, not in respect of it, but for the conseruation of himselfe, vntil the sharpnesse of the warre might be qualified with the time, and hath for that ende (for certaine yeares) com∣maunded them to haue the kéeping of the townes of <HI>Rochel, Montauban,</HI> and <HI>San∣cerre,</HI> and that they may there during and after the sayde terme, vse the exercise of
<PB REF="12"/> the sayde religion: They desire and most humbly beséeche, that it maye please the king, for the reasons that they haue more at large declared vnto the <HI>Sieurs de Biron</HI> &amp; <HI>Malassize,</HI> to graunt vnto them <HI>la Charite</HI> in stéede of the towne of <HI>San∣cerre</HI> for the sayde assurance, and to adde to the number of the thrée townes, the towne of <HI>Angoulesme,</HI> in respect of the si∣tuation of the sayde <HI>Rochell,</HI> and for bet∣ter health sake, and other commodities.</P>
<P N="29">29 Beside these things, and touching others besides the King, as is aforesayde, there haue bene diuers other thinges propounded, contayned in the Articles presented vnto the King, of which there can nor ought to be cut off scarcely one, seing they serue all to this ende, that the peace maye be the surer and stronger. True it is, that the principallest and most important of them, are, that all straun∣gers, men of warre, maye withdrawe themselues the spéediest that maye be out of this Realme, the Kings subiectes to their houses, or other places that they shal choose for their abode without being im∣peached.</P>
<P N="30"><PB REF="12"/>30 And to take away all mistrusting; and not to giue libertie to the gouernors of Countries to execute their reuenge a∣gainst townes, and specially against those that haue bene or are kept by those of the Religiō, or to cause them to redéeme their yll handling by force of exactions vpon the inhabitantes of the same Townes: It maye please the King to discharge all those townes that be not vpon the Fron∣tires, and wherein there haue béene no Garrisons vsed to be put.</P>
<P N="31">31 That all the Mareschals of Fraunce in ryding their circuites according to the distribution of their prouince, shall be one∣ly accompanied with Gentlemen and o∣ther men of learning of both the Religi∣ons in lyke number, at the least of the lesse partiall and most louers of peace and common tranquilitie. Which shall bée lykewise put in vre at the choyse and e∣lection of the Commissioners, for the exe∣cution of the Edict of pacification.</P>
<P N="32">32 That the sayde Mareschalles of Fraunce and Commissioners, shall cause the inhabitantes of the townes of both the Religions to sweare, the obseruing and performing of the said Edict in all points
