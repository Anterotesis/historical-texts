<HEAD>¶ THE GREAT CON∣IVNCIONS OF THE thre hyest Planettes, Saturne, Iupiter, and Mars, that are called, Maior, Me∣dia, and Minor.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>SPTHOLOME sayth in centiloqui, verbo. 50. all the mutations, chaunges, and alteracions, that happen in this worlde, amonges the Creatures, are knowen by the hundreth and twentye coniunctions, a∣monges the seuen planettes, of the which .vi. are most pryncypall.</P>
<P>THe fyrst is betwyxte Saturne and Iu∣piter in the begynnynge of Aries, the whiche is but ones in .ix. hundreth .liii. yeres, and. lxxxxi, dayes, so that in eyghte of these comunctions remaine seuen other yeres from theyr beginnynges, the influence of this coniunctyon causeth greate and meruelous chaunges, and notable alteracions, throughe all the clymattes of the worlde, and sygny∣fyeth newe sectes, and chaungynge of cu∣stomes
<PB REF="4"/> lawes, and disposicions amonges the people, and mutacyons of greate Empires, Kyngedomes, and Lordeshyppes, and also great plages, pestylence, and mortalyte, and of all other vnyuersall thynges that is nota∣ble throughe the worlde, because of the slowe mouynge of them, theyr orbes and cyrcles ar so hye and great, for the spere of Saturne is from the earthe, syxe hundreth thousande, thousand, fyue hundreth thousande, thre hun¦dreth thousande, fifty thousande, seuen thou∣sande, and fyue hundreth myles, and the thick¦nes of his orbe is within fyue hundreth thou∣sande thousande myles, of as muche, and his compasse, is nereby thre folde as muche as his heyght, and the verye sterre of Saturne is .ix. tymes greater then all the earth.</P>
<P>¶ The seconde coniunction is also betwyxt Saturne, and Iupiter, in the begynnynge of euery triplicite, the whiche is but ons in two hundreth .xxxviii. yeres, and two hundrethe and .xv. dayes. Whose influence bryngeth in mutacions, and alteracyons of these sectes, disposicions, and notable thinges aboue said, accordynge to the nature of the tryplicites. Also Saturne and Iupiter is ioyned .xii. tyme together in euery triplicite, that is to saye, in euery twenty yeres, they are ons ioyned in e∣uery signe of one tryplicite, whose influence makethe alteracyon of these thynges afore∣sayd,
<PB REF="4"/> accordynge to the nature of the sygnes, in whome this coniunction fallethe, for the tyme of .xx. yeres, and then at the entrance in∣to an other triplicite, the influence altereth accordynge to the nature of the triplicite.</P>
<P>❧ And this coniunction of .xx. yeres is the thyrde of the .vi. pryncypall. Also Saturne hath in euery triplicite tenne reuolucions by whose influence is knowen the remaynynge and chaungynge of these sectes, and dyspo∣sicions aforesayd, accordynge to the entrance of Saturne into the mouable or fyry sygnes, &amp; also according to his nature. Furthermore according to the cōiunction of Iupiter to the other .vii. planettes, so altereth and changeth the sectes, customes, and lawes, that are fyrst brought in by the great cōiunctions, as when he is ioyned with Saturne, he bringeth in the Iewyshe lawe, and causethe mankynde to be styfe, and stubbourne, agaynst the true lawe, of Chryst: with Mars the Caldes lawe, that worshypped the fyre, and other false y∣mages, with the Sonne, the Egyptians law that worshypped the Sonne, Moone, and Sterres, euen as all thynges hadde bene de∣stened to come by them of necessyte, with Venus, the Saracens lawe, the whiche was al together lecherie, regarding neither order, nor lawe, but all in common, and oftymes, agaynst kinde, with Mercury, the Christians
<PB REF="5"/> lawe, and al other lerning, perteyning to the knowledge of God, and his workes, with the Moone, the inconstancy of al lawes, and con¦trary disputaciōs of these aforsaid, according to other planetes that the Mone hath aspecte vnto: and thus as Iupiter betokeneth lawes, Mars doth sygnifie batels, the Sonne peace and concorde: Mercury lerning and knowe∣ledge, &amp; after theyr cōiunctions, thus consider their influences as saith Albumasar .li. de ma¦gis coniunctionibus, tract .ii. differetur octa.</P>
<P>¶ The .iiii. coniunction is betwixe Saturne and Mars in the beginninge of Cancer, the which is but ons in .xxx. yeres, whose influēce bringeth in warres, debates, and battels, and much contrariousnes, for these thinges afore∣said. Also a coniunction betwyxte Iupiter and Mars signifieth tempestes of weather, with rayne, and snowe, and corruption of the ayre, and also stryfe, debate, and batell.</P>
<P>❧ The fyfth coniunction is betwyxte the Sonne and Moone at the entraunce of the Sonne into Aries of whose influence com∣meth yerely dispositions.</P>
<P>¶ The .vi. is of the Sonne and Moone in euery moueth, of whose influence commeth monethly and wekely, dispositions. Also the Moone is ioyned withal the planetes ons in a moneth, wherof cometh dayly inclinatiōs, so that al most frō a, M. yeres to euery daye, the
<PB REF="5"/> alteratiō and disposition of al creatures may be knowne by these .C. and .xx. coniunctions aforesaide, also to haue the true computation and calculacion of the beginning of these cō∣iunctions ye must considre, that in their reuo∣lutiōs they come not to the same poynt where they began correspondinge the zodiake of the viii. spere by, iii. minutes in one yere. Whose hole course is .vii. M. yeres, wherin is contey∣ned nereby .viii. great coniunctions betwyxte Saturne &amp; Iupiter in the beginning of Aries</P>
<P>¶ Also the zodiake of the. ir. spere changeth and altereth the begynnynge of these▪ greate coniunctions xxvi. secōdes in one yere, whose hole course is xlir. thousande yeres, wherein is conteyned .lii. coniunctions, betwixte Sa∣turne and Iupiter in the beginninge of Aries.</P>
<P>¶ Also ye must consider the space of the daye that the Sonne dyd stande styll, and not re∣moue in the time of Iosue, &amp; also the .x. houres in the tyme of Ezechie, the which dothe alter the beginninges of these great cōiunctions, so that the {per}fyt calculacion knowne, their mer∣uelous influence shal surely be prognosticated</P>
<P>¶ Furthermore knowe ye that the .x. spere goeth round about in. xriiii. houres &amp; draweth al the other speres &amp; planetes with hī, so that al the worlde hath therby influence, &amp; inclina¦tion, euery houre, and minute, so that frome euerye houre of the daye, tyl .xlix. M. yeres, ye

<P>❧ Also in the yere a. M .iiii. C .lxxxix. the x. reuolucions of Saturne was fully ended,

<P>Furthermore, ye shal know, that in the reuo∣lution fygure for the yere, in the begynnynge of Saturnes reuolucyon, Iupiter was set in a moueable sygne in the house of religion be∣ynge retrograde, the which doth signifie vn∣stedfastnes of lawes, faith, and customes, for the tyme of this Saturmens reuolution, by∣cause that Iupiter is not strong in the fygure and also lodged in an vnstedfast place. Fur∣thermore ye shall knowe, that in the tyme of this reuolution, the wether shal stande chiefe∣lye with moystnes, and by watry more then with drought, and the earth shall brynge forth all growynge thynge ryghte well, and many colde syckenes of flume shall reygne, as drop∣ses, goutes, poses, and suche lyke. Also no great vnyuersal warres are lyke to reygne in this reuolucion, but accordynge to the appli∣cation of Mars to the other planettes, as
<PB REF="10"/> chyefelye, when he is ioyned with Saturne, he causeth the people, and specially the Sa∣turniens, and those that be vnder Mars, to be of preuey sectes and councels in hye mat∣ters of the faith, lawes, and religion, and also to moue warre and battell in suche causes. And thus consyder of all the other planettes as he ioyneth with them. Also yf ye maruell why in this reuolucion of Saturne, the tyme shall stande most with varyacion, alteracyon of faith, lawes, religion, and customes, know that in the fygures of the yeare, at the begyn∣nynge of Saturnes reuolucion, the lorde of that yere dyd commytte his power and dys∣posycyon to Iupiter, the sygnyfycatoure of faythe, and lawes, and by his retrograda∣cyon is sygnyfyed the wekenesse and incon∣stantnes of the aforesayde fayth, and lawes, and bycause the Lorde Iupiter beynge in the house of relygion, and in a moueable sygne, it is sygnyfyed thereby, the mutacyon and great alteracyon thereof, and chyefelye a∣monges the relygyon professours, and tea∣chers of the same, so that the perfecte stablis∣ment and seasynge of this varyacyon, is not lyke to be fullye ended in all peoples hertes, vnto the ende and terme of this sayde reuo∣lucyon of Saturne.</P>
