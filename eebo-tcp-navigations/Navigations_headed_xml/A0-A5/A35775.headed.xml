<HEAD>A brief Description of the Seven Provinces OF THE UNITED NETHERLANDS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He <HI>Ʋnited Netherlands</HI> is part of <HI>Belgia</HI> or <HI>Lower Germany;</HI> bounded on the East with <HI>Westphalia,</HI> on the West with the <HI>North Sea,</HI> on the North with <HI>Embdenland,</HI> and on the South with <HI>Flan∣ders</HI> and <HI>Brabant.</HI></P>
<P>It consists of the Provinces of <HI>Gelderland, Hol∣and, Zealand, Friesland, Ʋtrecht, Overyssel, Zutphen</HI> and <HI>Groen∣nghen,</HI> part of <HI>Brabant</HI> and part of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>These Provinces are called the <HI>Ʋnited Netherlands,</HI> from an Agreement and Contract made among themselves in the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>571, to throw off their Subjection and Allegiance to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> their Soveraign Lord, and to unite all their Power and Force against him.</P>
<P>But though they thus united their Power, yet are all these Provinces, yea and most of their Cities in each Province, distinct Commonwealths of themselves, and governed by Laws and Customs different from each other. Only for managing of Publique Affairs, each Province and City of note sends their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tates or Trustees to the <HI>Hague,</HI> where they debate Affairs in a Parliamentary order. And these States thus assembled, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alled the <HI>States General,</HI> or, as they stile themselves, <HI>The High and Mighty States of the Ʋnited Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>In Councel with these States sate formerly the Prince of <HI>O∣range,</HI> General of their Armies, who for his many Services done against the <HI>Spaniards</HI> since their foresaid Revolt, was by them made Stadt-holder, Admiral of the Seas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and al∣lowed in their Assembly a double Voice; which Offices and
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>Titles have since descended to his Heirs the Successive Princes of <HI>Orange.</HI> But in the year 16 Faction and Jealousie suggested to some Leading Men in their Councels, that so much Authority was not fit to be invested in a Sngle Person, lest by his Power he should change their Commonwealth into a Monarchy, and of Free States make them all his Subjects. To prevent which danger, they Voted that the Generalship belonged not to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> as his Right, but their Courtesie; and made an Edict, that for the future there should be no more Stadt-hol∣der; and caused all the States General to take an Oath to ob∣serve this Edict inviolably. Nay, when this present Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in the year 16 was made General of their Armies, they caused him to swear never to accept of the Office of Stadt-hol∣der. But this seems only the humour of the <HI>Hogen Mogens,</HI> and not the voice of the People: for they remembring the many good Offices of his Forefathers done for the State, cry out against these proceedings with him; and taking an advantage of the present troubles their Country is in, in a tumultuous manner force the States to abjure their former Edict, and absolve the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> of his foresaid Oath, and make him their Stadt-holder, Amiral, Disposer of the Militia, and in their Assemblies to have a double Voice, as his Forefathers had. But to the Description of the Country; and First</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> Gelderland.</HEAD>
<P>THe Land now called <HI>Gelderland,</HI> or <HI>Gelve,</HI> was formerly called <HI>Ponthis;</HI> and had from <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour the additional name <HI>De Caluwe.</HI> It was first made a Lordship in the year 878. Its first Lord (as <HI>Guicciardine</HI> relates) was <HI>Win∣chard van Pont,</HI> who with his Brother <HI>Leopold</HI> built the Castle <HI>Pont-Gelve,</HI> which now is the City of <HI>Gelder,</HI> and gives name to the whole Province. It is a strong City.</P>
<P>This Province is begirt in the North with the Land of <HI>Overyssel</HI> and the <HI>South-Sea;</HI> On the South, in part with the <HI>Mase</HI> and the Lordship of <HI>Gulicb;</HI> in the West with the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and part of <HI>Cleveland;</HI> and in the East with the Bishoprick of <HI>Ʋtrecht.</HI> It
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>is a plain Country, with few Hills, but many delightful and profitable Woods, as that of <HI>Echterwalt</HI> to the Northwest of <HI>Aernhem,</HI> and several others. The Soyl is generally very fruit∣ful, particularly of Corn; and in many places, especially about the <HI>Rhine, Mase,</HI> and <HI>Wael,</HI> excellent Meadows for feeding of Cattle, which there are kept in great abundance.</P>
<P>In this Dakedom (besides that of <HI>Zutphen</HI> and its seven Vil∣lages, which is an Earldom of it self, and therefore shall be dis∣coursed in its proper place) are numbred fifteen walled Cities; as <HI>Nimmegen, Aernhem,</HI> and <HI>Reurmond,</HI> the three head-Cities; then <HI>Tiel, Bommel, Harderwijck, Wageninghen, Hattem, Elburg, Gelder, Venlo, Wachten, Douck, Stralen,</HI> and <HI>Erckelens.</HI> There are several other Towns in the Dukedom of <HI>Gelder,</HI> and Earl∣dom of <HI>Zutphen,</HI> that have been formerly walled; but by seve∣ral accidents have wholly or in part lost their Walls, but yet re∣tain their ancient Priviledges, as <HI>Batenburgh, Gent, Montfort, Echt, Burgh, Keppel,</HI> and several others. There are moreover above 300 Villages with Parish-Churches.</P>
<P>The States of the Dukedom of <HI>Gelder,</HI> and Earldom of <HI>Zut∣phen,</HI> consist of the Barons, Gentry, and the four head-Cities a∣foresaid, <HI>viz. Nimmegen, Aerahem, Reurmond,</HI> and <HI>Zutphen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nimmegen</HI> was formerly called <HI>Magus,</HI> from one <HI>Magus</HI> King of <HI>Gallia;</HI> but afterwards when one <HI>Bato</HI> King of the <HI>Katts</HI> came into the Land, and being delighted as well with the con∣venience of its scituation as the antiquity of the Place, he rebuilt and enlarged this almost-ruin'd City, and fortified it with three strong Walls, and called the City <HI>Nava Magen;</HI> which name be length of time is now altered into <HI>Nimmegen.</HI> Our Author tells us also, that the <HI>Betuwers,</HI> which he calls <HI>Bataviers,</HI> chose this City for the Metropolis and chief Seat of their Kingdom; from whence the Land about it is at this day called the Kingdom of <HI>Nimmegen;</HI> and the City it self by Latine Authors <HI>Pes Im∣perii,</HI> because, as some write, <HI>Charles</HI> the Great advanced it to the dignity of one of the three Royal Cities of these Lands: <HI>Aken</HI> being the First, <HI>this</HI> the Second, and <HI>Theonville</HI> in the Land of <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> the Third.</P>
<P><HI>Nimmegen</HI> lies upon an arm of the <HI>Rhine</HI> called the <HI>Wael,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>which there is very wide and deep. It is a great, strong, and populous City, whose Inhabitants after they came under the <HI>Oostenrijk</HI> Princes, much addicted themselves to Learning and Merchandise, when as before they only followed the Wars. The chief Church in this City is dedicated to the honour of St. <HI>Ste∣phen</HI> the first Martyr.</P>
<P>Among the ancient Buildings of this City, the chief is the Castle, scituate upon the top of an high Hill, from whence the whole City is discovered. This is held to be built by <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> who by the means of this Castle intended to keep the Country about it in subjection to his power. In and about this City hath been found for several years last past, many Antiqui∣ties of the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> even as about the banks of the <HI>Wael</HI> several Remnants and Ruines of <HI>Roman</HI> Fortifications are to be seen at this day; from whence those Places are yet called the <HI>Roman Footing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nimmegen</HI> is a City-Earldom, a free City, a member of the Kingdom, and Coyns money by their own Authority, and therefore makes no appeals to the Chancery of <HI>Gelderland,</HI> but at the first instance only to <HI>Aken:</HI> wherefore the Citizens of this City, as an acknowledgment of their superiority in the Com∣monwealth, send yearly a Glove full of Pepper; which is all the Tax they contribute towards the Publique charges. Yet doth not this Priviledge of theirs diminish the Authority of the States of <HI>Gelder,</HI> but they have likewise power to Coyn Money, and have the same Jurisdiction in this City as in other Cities of <HI>Gelderland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nimmegen</HI> came under the Power of the Dukedom of <HI>Gelders</HI> in the year 1248, by this means. Earl <HI>Otto</HI> the second of <HI>Gel∣der</HI> lent <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> and King of <HI>Rome</HI> 21000 Mark of Silver, on condition that if he repaid it not again on a set day, that then this City and its Appurtenances should be forfeit to him. This condition the Emperour <HI>Rodoiphus</HI> the first confirmed. And because the money was not accordingly restored, <HI>Nimmegen</HI> was incorporate into the Dukedom of <HI>Gel∣derland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aerenhem</HI> is by <HI>Cornelius Taeitus</HI> and other ancient Writers
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>called <HI>Arenacum.</HI> It lies on the right side of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> about a mile and half from the place where it divides it self into two branches, between <HI>Nimmegen</HI> and <HI>Doesburg,</HI> which lie each 6 miles from thence. It is a pretty, large, and well-built City, with fair and well-ornamented Churches in it, the chief of which is dedicated to the honour of S. <HI>Eusebius,</HI> in which Church lies buried <HI>Charles</HI> the first Duke of <HI>Gelderland,</HI> who died in the year 1538; after whose death, he dying without issue, the Dukedom of <HI>Gelderland</HI> and Earldom of <HI>Zutphen</HI> de∣scended by Contract to the aforesaid Emperour and his lawful Heirs, as Dukes of <HI>Brahant</HI> and Earls of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aernhem</HI> us'd in ancient times to be the general place of resi∣dence of the Dukes of <HI>Gelders.</HI> It was first compassed with Walls, and endowed with City-Priviledges by <HI>Otto</HI> the third of <HI>Nassow,</HI> Duke of <HI>Gelderland.</HI></P>
<P>Here resides the Provincial Court or Chancery of these two Countries, consisting of a Chancellour and ten Judges; four of which are of the greatest Nobility of the Land, from each Quarter or Circuit one: The other six are of Persons learned in the Law. From the Decrees of this Chancery there is no appeal: yet upon some Grounds another hearing may be had. Moreover, <HI>Philip</HI> the second King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as Duke of <HI>Gelder,</HI> erected in <HI>Aernhem</HI> a Chamber of Accounts, consisting of two Accountants, an Audi∣tor, and a Secretary. At this Chamber of Accounts must all the Officers (both Civil and Military) of the Commonwealth of <HI>Gelder</HI> and <HI>Zutphen</HI> give up the Accounts of their Trust.</P>
<P><HI>Aernhem</HI> is the Head-City of the fourth quarter of the Go∣vernment of <HI>Gelder, viz.</HI> the Quarter called the <HI>Veluwe;</HI> and hath incorporated with it <HI>Wageningen, Hattem, Harderwijck,</HI> and <HI>Elburg,</HI> all walled Cities, besides several Villages that keep Courts of Judicature, but with appeal to the upper Courts of this Circuit aforesaid.</P>
<P>The <HI>Veluwe</HI> is a small Country begirt on threesides with the South Sea, and on the fourth with the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Yssel;</HI> so that it is a place both excellent and profitable for Fishing, and is beside reasonably well provided of Woods and Forrest full of Game.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<P>By <HI>Aernhem</HI> lies another neck of Land called the <HI>Veluwe-Zoom,</HI> and extends on one side as far as <HI>Zutphen,</HI> and on the o∣ther side about <HI>Wagener;</HI> which is all Meadow-Grounds, and well furnished with store of Cattle.</P>
<P>At the mouth of the River <HI>Ruer,</HI> or <HI>Roer</HI> (which mingles with the <HI>Mase</HI>) lies the City <HI>Ruermond,</HI> from whence it takes its name; which commonly for shortness is called <HI>Remond;</HI> a fair and rich City, and as well for its scituation, natural accommo∣dations, and Populousness, is a strong Place; whose chief Church is Dedicated to the honour of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and Dig∣nified with the Title of a Cathedral.</P>
<P><HI>Ruermond</HI> is the Head-City of the second Quarter of <HI>Gelder∣land,</HI> and to it belongs <HI>Venlo, Gelder, Stralen, Wachtendonck,</HI> and <HI>Erckelens;</HI> with the Freedoms of <HI>Monford, Echt,</HI> and <HI>Niewerstat,</HI> lying about four Miles distant from one another; as also that of <HI>Kessel, Midler,</HI> and <HI>Kreckensteel,</HI> belonging to its par∣ticular Lords. It is a fair Village, and hath belonging to it a strong Castle seated upon a Hill. This Village takes its name from the small circumjacent Country called <HI>Kessel,</HI> which be∣longs to the Dukedom.</P>
<P>The smaller Towns of <HI>Gelderland</HI> we shall briefly run over. As <HI>Hattem,</HI> a little, but strong Town, having a Castle whose Walls are 24 foot thick; lying on the left hand of the <HI>Yssel,</HI> a∣bout 8 Miles from <HI>Elburg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Elburg</HI> is a little Town; It lies on the East-side of the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> 8 Miles distant from <HI>Harderwijck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harderwijck</HI> lies on the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> 20 Miles from <HI>Wagenin∣gen;</HI> formerly a Village, but made a Town, and walled about, in the year 1229, by Earl <HI>Otto</HI> the second of <HI>Gelderland,</HI> who also walled <HI>Aernhem, Bommel, Ruermond, Goch,</HI> and <HI>Wageningen;</HI> formerly all Villages, but by him made Towns. In this Town is by the States of <HI>Gelder</HI> and <HI>Zutphen</HI> a famous School erected, wherein is read Philosophy and Divinity, but neither Law nor Physick.</P>
<P><HI>Wageningen</HI> is a small, but strong Town, and very Ancient, if it be the same (as it is held) which <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> calls <HI>Vada.</HI> It lies 8 Miles from <HI>Aernhem,</HI> and as much from <HI>Nimmegen.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
<P><HI>Tiel</HI> lies on the right side of the <HI>Wael,</HI> 8 Miles from <HI>Bommel;</HI> is a good strong Town, whose power and jurisdiction reaches all over the little Island wherein it lies, and from whose name the Island it self is called the <HI>World of Tiel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bommel</HI> lies on the left side of the <HI>Wael.</HI> It is a good strong Town, and Head of that Island, which from it is called <HI>Bommel-weerd.</HI> This Isle is made of the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Mase,</HI> which together encompass it, and, as <HI>Guicciardine</HI> supposes, is the same that <HI>Caesar</HI> where he treats of the <HI>Mose</HI> calls the <HI>Isle of Bataviers.</HI> In this Island are many fair Villages, and particularly <HI>Rossem,</HI> the Birth-place of that famous Warriour <HI>Martin van Rossem.</HI> At this time <HI>Bommel</HI> is accounted one of the best and strongest fron∣tier Towns of the <HI>Ʋnited Netherlands:</HI> As also is that strong Fortification</P>
<P><HI>St. Andies,</HI> which lies above <HI>Rossem</HI> in the Peninsula, which can with its Bulwarks command both the <HI>Wael</HI> and the <HI>Mase.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stralen</HI> is a small, but strong Town, and lies about 6 Miles from <HI>Wachtendonck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Venlo</HI> lies about 6 Miles on the right hand of the <HI>Mose.</HI> It is a good and strong Town, where in the year 1543 the Duke of <HI>Clove</HI> delivered himself to <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, together with all his right and pretensions to the Dukedom of <HI>Gelderland</HI> and Earldom of <HI>Zutphen;</HI> to which the Estates of the Land also a∣greed. It was taken in the year 1632 by the States of the <HI>Ʋni∣ted Netherlands,</HI> under the Conduct of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> as also was <HI>Stralen</HI> and <HI>Ruermond.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wachtendonck</HI> lies upon the banck of the River <HI>Niers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Elekelens</HI> lies upon the Frontiers of the Dukedom of <HI>Gulick,</HI> about 4 Miles from <HI>Ruermond.</HI> The Soyl about it is very fruit∣ful of good Wheat and other Grain, insomuch that the Inha∣bitants addict themselves most to Husbandry.</P>
<P>These being all the walled Cities and Towns of <HI>Gelderland,</HI> we should here end this Discourse: but in regard the Earldoms of <HI>Kuylenburg</HI> and <HI>Buren</HI> are pretended to belong to the Go∣vernment of <HI>Gelder,</HI> and are however Members of it, we shall briefly touch at them.</P>
<P><HI>Kuylenburg</HI> is a fair Town, whose Command and Jurisdiction
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>hath a large extent. It lies, on the lest side of the water-stood Lacke, four Miles from <HI>Boren.</HI> It was raised to an Earldom by King <HI>Philip</HI> the Second of <HI>Spain,</HI> and by him endowed with great Priviledges.</P>
<P><HI>Buren</HI> is no Member of <HI>Gelder,</HI> and yet lies within the Duke∣dom. The City lies by the Flood <HI>Linge,</HI> four Miles from <HI>Tiel.</HI> It hath a Castle 1360 Paces in compass; on it four Towers, and about it three double Moats. It bears also the name of an Earldom, and hath jurisdiction over many Villages and consi∣derable derable quantity of Grounds. It belongs to the Prince of <HI>O∣range.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Earldom of <HI>Holland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOme Writers suppose it is called <HI>Holland</HI> from <HI>Holt,</HI> which in the <HI>Germane</HI> Language signifies <HI>Wood;</HI> because in An∣cient times, as they say, <HI>Holland</HI> was much overgrown with Woods. Others draw the name from the lowness and hollow∣ness of the Land. Others think it was called <HI>Hoyland,</HI> which signifies <HI>Hayland.</HI> But the learned <HI>Junius</HI> is of another Opi∣nion: For he believes that <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> were Colonies of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Danes;</HI> who leaving their Islands <HI>Oland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> in the <HI>Sound,</HI> called these so in remembrance of their own; as We and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have lately done in <HI>America</HI> by <HI>New England</HI> and <HI>New Spain,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The circumference of this Country is about 240 Miles; but its bredth such, that a man standing in the middle of it might travel out of its bounds in three hours time. This Country is very fruitful for Corn, although not imployed to that produce. But the Land is used for Meadows for Pasturage of Cattle, in which the Soyl is incredibly rich, and brings up the best and largest Cows, which do afford in a Summers day 11 quarts of Milk apiece: So that <HI>John Benning</HI> is of opinion, that in the Village of <HI>Assendelft,</HI> and four other circumjacent Villages, is more Milk given, then there comes Rhenish-wine to <HI>Dort</HI> from all <HI>Germany.</HI> Of their great abundance of Milk they make most excellent Butter, fit for the Palats of Princes; besides
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>great numbers of Cheeses, which for their worth may well compare either with them of <HI>Placencia,</HI> or those cal∣led <HI>Parmasan.</HI> The choice are those of <HI>Texel</HI> and <HI>Grave∣land,</HI> next those of <HI>Edam,</HI> especially when they grow so me what old.</P>
<P>This Country brings up very gallant Horses; And in the Sand-downs are an incredible number of Coneys. Here is also plenty of Harts, Hindes, and Hares; and particularly in the <HI>Hagues</HI> Woods are a great number of <HI>Roe-deer.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is here any want of Poultrey, especially of Geese, Ducks, and Snipes. For Fuel here are Fens, which together with their Ditches afford abundance of Turf.</P>
<P><HI>Holland</HI> hath formerly had Kings of their own, as is mentioned by <HI>Suetonius</HI> in the life of <HI>Caligula,</HI> Chap. 44. But was afterwards made an Earldom by <HI>Charles Calvo</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> in the year 863.</P>
<P>The People were formerly fam'd for great Warriours.</P>
<P>The Cities of <HI>Holland</HI> are these: <HI>Dort, Harlem, Delft, Leyden, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Goude, Naerden, Muyden, Wesop, Edam, Monickkendam, Purmerent, Alckmuer, Enckbuysen,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Dort</HI> is the Head-City of <HI>Holland;</HI> a rich City, and so abounds in eatable Provisions, that it may be accounted a Store-house for the circumjacent Places. It hath power to stop all forreign Commodities coming down the River; so that the Merchant is forced to sell his Wares there, and is not permitted to transport them from thence but in Ships belonging to this City. This Priviledge is called <HI>Staple-right.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harlem</HI> is in respect of its bigness, neat Buildings, and commodious Scituation, a very brave City; and hath in it the best Church in all <HI>Holland,</HI> whose Foundation stands upon very strong and Vast Pillars. It is held to be built by the <HI>Frieslanders</HI> in the year 506. The <HI>Harlemers</HI> affirm that Printing was invented in this City.</P>
<P><HI>Delft</HI> is the <HI>Dutch</HI> name for a Moat, from whence this City takes its name: for from the <HI>Mase</HI> hither is led a Moat or Ditch.</P>

<P><HI>Leyden,</HI> by <HI>Ptolony</HI> called <HI>Ladgduaum Batavorum,</HI> is a City lying on the middlemost <HI>Rbene.</HI> It is an Academy; And here is made great store of Linnen and Woollen-Cloath.</P>
<P><HI>Amsterdam</HI> takes its name from the <HI>Amabel.</HI> It was fortified about 300 years ago with Ports, Balwarks, Tow∣ers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the Heer <HI>Gijsbert van Amabel:</HI> But being by the ill will of their Neighbours burnt down, it was in the year 1482 encompassed with Walls; since which time it was made a City under the command of <HI>Hilland:</HI> And by the resort of all Nations of the World, is become the most famous City for Trade of all the World.</P>
<P><HI>Gowde</HI> takes its name from the <HI>Danish</HI> word <HI>Gouw,</HI> which signifies a Trench and Bank to contain it. It lies on the <HI>Yssel,</HI> and is well provided with all things necessary.</P>
<P><HI>Rotterdam,</HI> a City of great Trade, and is very full of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Besides these Cities, there are many Freedoms and un∣walled Towns; among which the <HI>Hague</HI> is the most Famous: Here assemble all the States, and here the Princes Councel-Chamber is kept.</P>
<P>The Earldom of <HI>Holland</HI> is Governed by three Estates; as first the Nobility, of which are chief the Earls of <HI>Eg∣mond, Ligny;</HI> to whom appertain the Lordships of <HI>Wasse∣naer, Valkenburg,</HI> and the Burg Earldom of the City of <HI>Leyden.</HI> Under <HI>Holland</HI> also are these Earldoms; <HI>Maestand, Goyland, Texel, Kennemeland,</HI> and <HI>Steenbergen;</HI> as also the Lordship and Barony of <HI>Brederode,</HI> to which belongs the Lordship of <HI>Vyanen,</HI> and the Barony of <HI>Lijsfelt.</HI> In the Chronicle of <HI>Holland</HI> are also found these Baronies; <HI>Leeke, Seven-bergen, Voorn, Ysselleyn, Stryen, Teylingen, Putten, Harlem, Leerdam, Aspheren, Arken, Altena</HI> and <HI>Rottersleet.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> Zealand.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ZEaland</HI> in <HI>Dutch</HI> signines <HI>Land of the Sea,</HI> from whence this Province may have its name; but it is most probable it took its name from the <HI>Danes</HI> who came hither to inhabit, and called it after the name of the place from whence they came, as was said before in the definition of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zealand</HI> consists of several Islands scituate between the <HI>Mase</HI> and the <HI>Schelde;</HI> bordering in the North on <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> in the East with <HI>Brabant</HI> in the South with <HI>Flanders,</HI> ad on the West with the <HI>North Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The Air of <HI>Zealand</HI> is not so wholesome as is the Air of its Neighbouring Countries, especially in Summer, be∣cause of the exhalations that rise from the Boggs and Fens; But then the Air is not ready to take the infection of Plague, as other Places; yet having once taken it, it rages most excessive furiously.</P>
<P>This Country is very fruitful in Corn, especially in Wheat, which is here as white and heavy as in any part of the World. The Soil is very fat, and fit for all Hus∣bandry.</P>
<P>Here grows much <HI>Coriander-seed,</HI> and <HI>Madder,</HI> a Dying-Stuff, in great Plenty. Here grows great and high Law∣rels, and other Herbs used in Physick.</P>
<P>Here are very pleasant Meadows for Cattle, not only within Inclosures, but on the Washes of the Sea, where several thousands are Feeding, both large, fat, and of excel∣lent rellish.</P>
<P>In the year 863, in the Reign of the Emperour <HI>Charles Calvi,</HI> this Country, as well as <HI>Holland,</HI> was advanced to the Dignity of an Earldom; whose first Earl was <HI>Ded<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rick</HI> Son of <HI>Sigisbert</HI> Prince of <HI>Aquitane.</HI></P>
<P>Under <HI>Zealand</HI> are reckoned seven Islands; of which three lie in the mouth of the <HI>Schelde</HI> towards <HI>Holland,</HI> and are called <HI>Schouwe, Duyvenland,</HI> and <HI>Tertholen;</HI> four lie Westward of the <HI>Schelde,</HI> called <HI>Walcheren, South-Beveland, North-Beveland,</HI> and <HI>Wolfersdijk.</HI> The
<PB N="14" REF="8"/>Land of <HI>Schonwen</HI> is the biggest, whose circumference is now but 28 Miles, though tormerly it was longer, and only separated by a small Isthmus from <HI>North-Beveland.</HI> The chief Towns are <HI>Zirick-zee</HI> and <HI>Brouwers-Haven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zirick-zee</HI> is counted the ancientest Town in all <HI>Zea∣land,</HI> and was Founded by one <HI>Siringue</HI> in the year 849. This hath been a flourishing Town of Trade, by reason of its good Haven, plenty of Commodities, and great num∣ber of Merchants: But the Haven being much choaked up by the washing of Sand into it, it hath lost much of its former Fame.</P>
<P><HI>Duyven-land,</HI> so called from the multitude of Doves there: In this Land are many Villages, but no Cities or Towns. In the year 1530, this Island was grievously o∣verflowed by the Sea, to the loss of many People. But by mending and strengthning the Banks, they have since kept out the Sea, and amply repaired their great damages.</P>
<P><HI>Tolen</HI> is separate from <HI>Brabant,</HI> but with a small strait of the Sea neer the Town of <HI>Tolen;</HI> so called, because there they collected Toll of Passengers that passed over. It is an old Town, not far from</P>
<P>St. <HI>Martins Dijck,</HI> a very delightful place, and full of Trees.</P>
<P><HI>Walcheren,</HI> the chief Island, so called by the first Inhabi∣tants, the <HI>Waloons</HI> or <HI>Gauls.</HI> this Island is 40 Miles a∣bout, and of great fame, in respect of its scituation, wealth, multitude of Inhabitants, Trade, and curiosity in their Ci∣ties and Villages. It hath four Cities in it: <HI>Middleburg, Flushing, Vere,</HI> and <HI>Aerumnyden;</HI> besides many Villages.</P>
<P><HI>Middleburgh</HI> takes its name from its scituation, it be∣ing a Burgh in the middle of the Island. It is a great City, well furnished with ordinary and extraordinary Build∣ings, Bridges, Towers and Bulwarks. It is the chief City in <HI>Zealand,</HI> and a City of great Trade. Here was born <HI>Pulus à Middleburgo,</HI> a famous Mathematician.</P>
<P><HI>Vere,</HI> or <HI>Camp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vere,</HI> takes its name from a Ferry, which the <HI>Zealanders</HI> call a <HI>Vere.</HI> It was first walled in the year 1358;
<PB N="15" REF="8"/>from which time it became a Town of Trade for <HI>Scotch</HI> Commodities.</P>
<P><HI>Flushing</HI> is a new City, very strong and powerful at Sea, full of Fishers, good Sea-men, and able Pilots.</P>
<P><HI>Acrnmuyden</HI> is as a fore-guard to <HI>Middleburg,</HI> and is a good Haven for Ships.</P>
<P><HI>South-Beveland</HI> stretches along the Coasts of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Brabant,</HI> and hath in few years last past been above half swallowed up by the Sea. On this Island stood the City <HI>Romers-wale,</HI> washt away with the Sea. And at this time all its Fields and Gardens are wholly swallowed p, so that the People about it live only upon the Salt-Trade. In this City the Earls of <HI>Zealand</HI> used to take the ordinary Oath.</P>
<P><HI>Tergoes</HI> lies in the West-part of this Island. It is a little city, but very pleasant and rich: the Citizens are very friendly and courteous. It is the only City now left in this Island.</P>
<P><HI>North-Beveland,</HI> which hath one City <HI>(Cortgene)</HI> and many Villages in it. This whole Island was in the year 1532 swallowed up by the Sea; but some of it is since re∣covered.</P>
<P><HI>Wolferts-Dijch,</HI> a very small Island, having but two Vil∣lages in it.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Zealand</HI> are careful, ingenious, and quick-witted, of middle Stature: yet their Chronicles make mention of a Gyantick woman born here, to whom the biggest men seemed but Dwarfs: she was so strong, that she could carry two Tuns full of Beer in both her hands, and could carry a piece of Timber that eight men could not tear.</P>
<P>This People is very strong at Sea, and have a particular faculty in cleansing foul Salt, which is rought thither from Westward Countries to that purpose. Of <HI>Spanish</HI> or <HI>British</HI> Salt they will boyl 100 pound; and by pouring water on it, and boyling it, they will increase it to 145 pound of pure Salt as white as Snow: which Salt, for
<PB N="16" REF="9"/>whiteness and fineness, is a good Commodity all over <HI>Furope.</HI> They make also great profits of Corn, Madder, and by their great number of Sheep. They are very neat and curious in their Houses and House-keeping, and very eager after Trade and Commerce, and very charitable to the Poor.</P>
<P>The Politick State of <HI>Zealand</HI> consists in three Estates: to wit, the Clergy; one Noble-man, which used to be the Marquess of <HI>Tervere,</HI> as a Representative of all the Gentry; and the Community of the Cities.</P>

<HEAD>Of Friesland.</HEAD>
<P>THe name of <HI>West-Friesland</HI> hath been diversly deriv'd: for some will have it from <HI>Frisia</HI> the Country of <HI>Phrygia;</HI> Others will have it from the bitter Frosts of this Country. <HI>Hadrianus Junius</HI> will have it call'd <HI>Friesland,</HI> from the freedom the People of the Country live in. The <HI>Frieslanders</HI> are accounted the ancientest People of all <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> and for their courage well known to the <HI>romans,</HI> who never changed their name.</P>
<P>The Air of this Country is tolerable wholesom, and not subject to the vapours of the Fens and Moorasses, whose exhalations are cleansed and putified by the smart Breeses that this Country is used to.</P>
<P>The Soil of this Country is very low and Fenny, scarce to be used but in the Summer-time; and therefore produces little Corn, because the Floods and yearly overflowings of the waters, which begin early and end late in the year, spoils the seed that is thrown into the Ground. Yet are there rich and fat Meadow-grounds which feed most ex∣cellent Cattle, from whence the Inhabitants gather yearly great profits. It would almost seem incredible what quan∣tities of excellent Butter and Cheese is yearly sent from hence into other Countries, besides what they spend them∣selves for their own necessity.</P>
<P>The Fewel of this Country is Turf, in regard there are few Woods and no Coal among them.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="9"/>
<P>This Province, till the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, had Kings of their own.</P>
<P>In <HI>West Friesland</HI> are accounted twelve Cities.</P>
<P><HI>Leuwarden</HI> is the chief City of all <HI>Friesland;</HI> a rich city, with fair Houses well furnished; is well defended with Moats and a C∣stle. Here is the Chamber of Justice and the Chancery of <HI>Friesland;</HI> from whose Decrees there is no Appeal.</P>
<P><HI>Zurichem,</HI> the Native place of <HI>Verglius,</HI> lies hard by it.</P>
<P><HI>Dockum</HI> lies in a fruitful Soyl, with fair Meadows about it.</P>
<P><HI>Sneeck</HI> in the Earldom of <HI>Westergoe</HI> lies in low watery Grounds, so that no corn grows there; but it hath rich Meadow; to feed Cat∣tle in. This City is quite new, and scarce above 200 years endow'd with the Title of a City. It is in process of time so increas'd, that it may now compare with any city of <HI>Friesland.</HI> Here was born <HI>Jo∣achim Hopper, Petrus à Fermita, Albertus, Hero,</HI> and several other Learned men.</P>
<P><HI>Staveren</HI> lies in a Plain, divided by Dijcks and Pools of Water. The chief strength of this City is its Castle, standing by the Ha∣ven, and butting out into the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Harlingen</HI> lies on he mouth of the South-Sea in a fruitful Soyl: It is well defended with a Castle, and hath a good Haven, which brings a good Trade to this City.</P>
<P><HI>Franiker,</HI> called so by the <HI>Francks:</HI> Here is an University.</P>
<P>The other Cities are <HI>Damme, Bolswarden, Yest, Sloten, Worcum</HI> and <HI>Hendelopen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friesland</HI> hath many Islands belonging to it, among which <HI>Schel∣ling</HI> is the chief, famous for the many Sea-Dogs that there come basking in the Sun-shine upon the Sea-shores, and are by the strange hopping and dancing of the Country-people cloathed all over, dril∣led so far ashoar, that when they would retire to Sea again they are caught in Nets. On this Island the chief Town was burnt by the <HI>English,</HI> in the year 1665.</P>
<P><HI>Friesland</HI> is divided into three Estates. The first is the Earldom of <HI>Oostergow,</HI> of which <HI>Leuwarden</HI> is the chief City. It is subdivided into Grietonies; as <HI>Leuwarderdeel,</HI> in which is <HI>Leuwarden; Tietzerck∣sterdeel,</HI> in which is <HI>Tietzark; Ydarderdeel,</HI> in which is <HI>Ydaert; Rauwerderahem,</HI> in which is <HI>Rauwart; Ferwerderadeel,</HI> in which is

<P>The second State is the Earldom of <HI>Westergouw,</HI> under which are these Grietenies; <HI>Wonseradeel,</HI> in which is <HI>Witmarsum; Franle∣keradeel,</HI> in which is <HI>Franeker; Banadeel,</HI> in which is <HI>Mumersgae; Meynaldummadeel,</HI> in which is <HI>Meynaldum; Baerdaradeel,</HI> in which is <HI>Baert; Hennardaradcel,</HI> in which is <HI>Hennaert; Weynbritzera∣deel,</HI> in which is <HI>Gauve; Geesterlant,</HI> in which is <HI>Wickel.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the Bishoprick of <HI>Ʋtrecht.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>HAdrianus Junius</HI> is of opinion that <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> took its name from a numerical Distinction that the <HI>Romans</HI> gave their Garrisons lying upon the <HI>Rhine:</HI> for in the place where this City stands, was quartered the five and thirtieth Legion, which they by abbreviating the words, thus wrote: <HI>Ʋ. TRIG. LEG. STAT.</HI> which at length is <HI>Quintae tricesima Legionis Statio; viz.</HI> the Quarters of the five and thirtieth Legion. These half words have some unskill'd in the Latine Tongue taken for whole, and thought by leaving out the three Letters <HI>LEG,</HI> and coupling the rest, they might well make it <HI>Ʋtrigstat,</HI> which now is called <HI>Ʋtrecht.</HI></P>
<P>Others write that the City of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> was at first called <HI>Anto∣nina,</HI> from one <HI>Antonius</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Consul, who because of the ty∣ranny of <HI>Nero</HI> the Emperour fled from <HI>Rome</HI> hither, and built this City: which was afterwards destroyed by the wilde people, and by them made a strong Fortress, and from them was called <HI>Wiltenburgh.</HI></P>
<P>This Fortress <HI>Dagobert</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> took afterwards, made it much stronger then before, and called it <HI>Trajectum,</HI> signifying a passage or thorow-fare, because it was so from all parts, as it ap∣pears by a Table hanging up in the Cathedral Church at <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> written in old Latine Verses.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="10"/>
<P>The Bishop <HI>Balderijck</HI> (who these Verses say) encompassed this City with the Wall it now hath, repaired and mended the Cathe∣dral; for which his generous and publique-spirited Actions, the Emperour <HI>Charles de Caluwe</HI> presented him with the Cities of <HI>De∣venter</HI> and <HI>Thielt,</HI> and the jurisdiction of the same.</P>
<P>That the City was of old called <HI>Antonina,</HI> appears by the afore∣said Verses, and also by the Authority of many old Writers, and se∣veral old Medals found thereabouts.</P>
<P>Its first Arch-bishop was St. <HI>Willeboort</HI> an <HI>English Saxon,</HI> who came over in the year 690: since when, till the time of <HI>Frederick Tautenburgh</HI> the last Arch-bishop of this City, it hath had dominion over the Bishopricks of <HI>Holland, Zealand</HI> and <HI>Friesland:</HI> But he dying in the year 1580, the Temporal States of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> took the Government into their own hands, and entred into Covenants of Union with the <HI>High and Mighty States of the Ʋnited Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>This City lies on an old Branch of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which before it took its course into the <HI>Leck,</HI> passed by here, and from hence into the Sea. It is so commodiously seated, that from hence a man may travel in one days time to which one he will of fifty walled Cities equidistant round about it; or he may set out in the morning, and Dine at any one of 26 Cities, and come back again to Supper at night.</P>
<P><HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> is a great and strong City; and before it fell from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> it had a formidable Castle. The Cathedral Church is dedicated to St. <HI>Martin,</HI> and is a very brave and magnificent Building. The rest of the Churches in <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> which are many, and those very stately ones, we shall pass by for brevities sake.</P>
<P>The Provincial Court of Judicature is here kept; and consists of one President, nine Judges, and other Officers. The Citizens are very courteous, witty, and many of them very rich, but somewhat proud. When the Clergy were here in their splendour, this City was one of the most flourishing Cities in all the <HI>Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>We come now to the smaller Towns of this Province; which are <HI>Wijk at Duerstede,</HI> one of the oldest Towns of all <HI>Batavia;</HI> for∣merly, as is said, so great and powrful, that it had at least 500 Temples in it; but afterwards destroy'd by the <HI>Normans.</HI> It is a to∣lerable good Town, and rich, lying on the <HI>Leck</HI> a branch of the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<PB N="20" REF="11"/>
<P><HI>Rhenen</HI> also an old Town, and, as it seems, called <HI>Grinnes</HI> by <HI>Cornelius Tacitus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amersfort,</HI> a well-inhabited Town, and well accommodated with Provisions; whose Inhabitants are naturally addicted to the wars.</P>
<P><HI>Monifort,</HI> a brave and strong Town, formerly appointed for a Frontier Town against <HI>Holland;</HI> with whom, because the Empe∣rour <HI>Charles de Caluwe</HI> had given a great part of the Bishoprick, they kept a long and bloody War always stirring, to maintain their ancient Authority: And the <HI>Hollanders</HI> stirring industriously to keep what was granted them.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> was then so strong, that Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the se∣cond, who liv'd about the year 1450, writes, that the Bishop could raise at once 40000 armed men of his own People. And though he were sorely opprest by his Neighbours, to wit, the <HI>Hol∣landers, Gelderlanders,</HI> and <HI>Frieses;</HI> yet he could withstand them all, and defend his City manfully against them.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Lordship of <HI>Overyssel.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>OVeryssel</HI> was called by the Latines <HI>Transisulana,</HI> and as a translate of the word, <HI>Overyssel;</HI> because it lies on the other side of the River <HI>Yssel.</HI> It hath three good divisions: to wit, <HI>Yseland</HI> or <HI>Zalland, Drente,</HI> and <HI>Twente.</HI> It is a plain Country, very fruitful, and yields good Corn. It hath in it many small Woods very profitable to the Inhabitants; and ten places that are indowed with large priviledges; as namely, <HI>Meppen, Geelmuyden, Coevorden, Hardenberge, Omme, Almeloo, Goor, Diepenhem, Delden,</HI> and <HI>En∣schede.</HI> It hath eight walled Cities, and above two hundred Villages; among which, some are very great and fair ones. It consists of two Estates: the first, of the Officers and Gentry; the other, of the three Cities <HI>Deventer, Campen,</HI> and <HI>Swolle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Deventer</HI> is a good and reasonable big City, and very strong; full of fair Houses, and many publique Buildings; well inhabited, and full of People. On the North-west it lies on a sandy Hill, but all the rest of the City is encompassed with fair low Meadows, which o∣verflow with the upper waters. The <HI>Yssel</HI> running along the Key or Wharf on one side, serves it as a Moat. The other sides of it are strengthened in part with a deep Moat, and in part with a broad Haven. Its walls are high, and thick set with Towers, and many
<PB N="21" REF="11"/>Bulwarks, and other strong Fortifications. It is a City of great Trade, by reason that it and the two other chief Cities of this Country have had an ancient confederacy with the Hanse or <HI>Aen∣zce</HI> Towns, and were in the year 1495 put into the number of the free Imperial Cities, and endowed with many large Priviledges.</P>
<P><HI>Campen</HI> (though it be accounted in <HI>Overyssel,</HI> yet it lies on this side the <HI>Yssel</HI>) is a great and fair City, and well Traded: yet for∣merly, before the waters were grown so shallow, it had a far greater Trade than now. It is well fortified with Walls, Towers, Moats and Bulwarks. It lies low on the Wash of the River, which is very broad in that place; which is a great strength to the City, because the Citizens can when they please, set it under water. In the mid∣dle of it there is a fair strong Bridge over the River, whose Locks are 90 Foot wide.</P>
<P>Some think this was the Road of <HI>Ptolomies</HI> Ships: Others hold it to be the Port or Haven of <HI>Manarmanis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zwol</HI> lies on a Rivolet which falls into the <HI>Vider</HI> or <HI>Vecht.</HI> It is a good and strong City, having double Moats and Walls. This City for its strength used to be the retreat and refuge of those of <HI>Vollenhove,</HI> the common residence of the Governour and Councel of <HI>Overyssel</HI> in all times of War and Danger.</P>
<P><HI>Vollenhoven</HI> lies upon the South-Sea. A good city, and well fur∣nish'd by Water and Land with all necessary Provisions. Here re∣sides, as aforesaid, the Provincial Councel of <HI>Overyssel,</HI> from whose Decrees there is no Appeal.</P>
<P><HI>Steenwijck</HI> seems to be an old City, though small. The Soyl a∣bout it is rich in corn, and affords in some places store of Turf, whereby the City hath a reasonable Trade. It used formerly to be a weak City: but since the Wars with <HI>Spain,</HI> it is grown very strong. It hath formerly had a Castle, but destroy'd in the year 1523.</P>
<P><HI>Hasselt</HI> is a good, reasonable rich, and strong City.</P>
<P>The old Village <HI>Ootmarsen</HI> was, as <HI>Trithemius</HI> writes, founded by <HI>Odemar</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> from whom it hath its name: He built it upon the Grave of his special Friend <HI>Vechtan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oldeseel</HI> is held to take its name from the People of old called <HI>Salii:</HI> it is a small Village; and is the onely Village of <HI>Overyssel</HI> that is under the command of the Arch-Duke, who ordinarily keeps a Garrison here.</P>

It is a good, famous, well-timber'd, and strong City; well fortified with Moats and Bulwarks on one side, and on the other with Quagmires. It lies on the right side of the <HI>Yssel,</HI> which <HI>Pliay</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la</HI> say is a branch of the <HI>Rhint,</HI> and call it <HI>Flevam;</HI> for inwards flows the <HI>Berkel,</HI> which mingles its Water with the <HI>Yssel.</HI> It was in former times very rich and Powerful, as their Proverb witnesseth: <HI>Nimmegen</HI> the oldest, <HI>Ruermond</HI> the greatest, <HI>Zutphen</HI> the richest, and <HI>Acrnhem</HI> the pleasantest. The chief Church is dedicated to the honour of St. <HI>Walburgh.</HI> It is an old Church, and well built for matter and form, according to the fa∣shion of the old and first Christian times.</P>
<P>The Earldom of <HI>Zutphen</HI> came under the Dukedom of <HI>Gelder</HI> by the marri∣age of <HI>Otto</HI> the first <HI>Gelders</HI> Earl with the Daughter of <HI>Gerlack</HI> Earl of <HI>Zut∣phen,</HI> about the year 1082.</P>
<P><HI>Doesburgh,</HI> as some Authors of these times say, is the same City that <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> calls <HI>Asciburgum:</HI> it is a populous City, and in the last War with the Spaniards made very strong, to serve for a Fortress or Bulwark for the quarter of <HI>De Velnwe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dotecum,</HI> a pretty good City hard by it. Earl <HI>Hendrick</HI> of <HI>Gelder</HI> raised that fa∣mous cloister of <HI>Bethlebem,</HI> which in the last <HI>Spanish</HI> troubles was most destroy'd.</P>
<P><HI>Lochem,</HI> a strong and well-scituate Town, which during the aforesaid Wars was often taker on both sides.</P>
<P><HI>Grolle,</HI> a very strong Town, was conquered by the States of the <HI>United Ne∣therlands</HI> in the year 1627.</P>
<P><HI>Bredevoort</HI> also, a very strong and well-provided Town.</P>
<P><HI>Brenckburst</HI> a good Town, raised as is said to a particular Earldom.</P>
<P><HI>S'Heren-berge,</HI> a good Town, having under its Authority much Land at great distance from it; so that it hath the Title of an Earldom, formerly belong∣ing to its own Lord the Earl <HI>William,</HI> a brave Prince.</P>

<PB N="23" REF="12"/>and send their Deputies to the <HI>Hague.</HI> It is not only the Head-City, but the only City of this Country; and as some hold, called of <HI>Ptolomy, Phileum;</HI> of <HI>Pliny, Phylleum.</HI> It took its name from <HI>Grunias</HI> a <HI>Trojan</HI> Gentleman, or as <HI>Munster</HI> writes a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman: which opinions may both be true, since the <HI>French</HI> confidently affirm they had their original from the <HI>Trojans.</HI> The <HI>Friese</HI> Historiographers hold that this <HI>Grunius</HI> was the son of <HI>Gailo,</HI> and that his great Grandfather was called <HI>Friso,</HI> from whom <HI>Friesland</HI> seems to have taken its name: which <HI>Grunius</HI> having this small, but brave quarter for his share, built this City of <HI>Groeningen,</HI> and called it after his own name.</P>
<P>It hath many flowing and standing Waters, led to it by many great Rivers, part made by Nature, and part by mens hands. It is a large, fair, Populous and strong City, full of brave and Lordlike Houses. Its chief Church is a very stately building, and dedicated to the honour of St. <HI>Martin,</HI> and was formerly under the Bishoprick of <HI>Munster</HI> in <HI>Westphalia,</HI> but was, by King <HI>Philip</HI> the second, it self ad∣vanced to the Honour of a Bishops See. That learned man <HI>Rodolphus Agricola</HI> was a Citizen of this City, who with his own hands made an Organ which is yet to be seen here, as a great rarity.</P>
<P>In the year 1614, the States General erected an University in this City, and have spared no cost to furnish it with Learned men from all parts.</P>
<P>The Authority of this City is very great, and extends it self very far: For first, it hath Eastwards and Westwards under its jurisdiction a very large Country, and many Villges in it; Northwards it hath acknowledgment from all the Country that lies between its Walls and the Sea; which is a very fat soil, and especially good for the feeding of Cattle. This Country, as was said, is called the <HI>Ommelanden.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Groeningen</HI> the People live very handsomly, like Citizens, as in a free Re∣publique: for the City hath great Priviledges and Franchises from their Princes, Judging all Causes both Civil and Criminal according to their own Laws; the Princes keeping there only a Stadt-holder, as the States General do in Civil Causes; but in Criminal they act according to their own pleasure, shewing Mercy or Justice to whom they please, even as absolute and Sovereign Lords do. They used to pay their Prince but 12000 Gilders a year.</P>
<P><HI>Dam</HI> is a small Village, though it hath formerly been a considerable Town: for in the year 1536, its Walls were broken down by the Emperours Forces and, as is said, are not to be re edified, or a Moat to be made about it. It suffered also much in the foresaid <HI>Spanish</HI> Troubles.</P>
<P><HI>Delf-ziel,</HI> a handsome Village lying on the wash of the Sea, hath formerly been a strong Hold, but several times demolished and rebuilt. It suffered also very much in the last spanish Troubles.</P>
