<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE PROVINCE of Pennsilvania IN AMERICA; Lately Granted under the Great Seal of ENGLAND TO William Penn, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SInce (by the good providence of God) a Country in <HI>America</HI> is fallen to my lot, I thought it not less my Duty than my honest In∣terest to give some publick notice of it to the World, that those of our own, or other Nations, that are inclin'd to Transport themselves or Families beyond the Seas, may find another Country added to their choice, that if they shall happen to like the <HI>Place, Conditions</HI> and <HI>Con∣stitutions,</HI> (so far as the present Infancy of things will allow us any prospect) they may, if they please, fix with me in the <HI>Province</HI> here∣after describ'd. But before I come to treat of my particular Concern∣ment, I shall take leave to say something of the benefit of <HI>Plantations</HI> or <HI>Colonies</HI> in general, to obviate a common Objection.</P>
<P><HI>Colonies</HI> then are the Seeds of Nations begun and nourished by the care of wise and populous Countries; as conceiving them best for the in∣crease of Humane Stock, and beneficial for Commerce.</P>
<P>Some of the wisest men in History have justly taken their Fame from this Design and Service: We read of the Reputation given on this ac∣count to <HI>Moses, Joshua</HI> and <HI>Caleb</HI> in Scripture-Records; and what Re∣nown the <HI>Greek</HI>-story yields to <HI>Lycurgus, Theseus,</HI> and those <HI>Greeks</HI> that
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> Planted many parts of <HI>Asia:</HI> Nor is the <HI>Roman</HI> account wanting of in∣stances to the Credit of that People; They had a <HI>Romulus,</HI> a <HI>Numa Pompilius;</HI> and not only reduc'd, but moraliz'd the Manners of the Nations they subjected; so that they may have been rather said to con∣quer their Barbarity than Them.</P>
<P>Nor did any of these ever dream it was the way of decreasing their People or Wealth: For the cause of the decay of any of those States or Empires was not their <HI>Plantations,</HI> but their <HI>Luxury and corruption of Man∣ners:</HI> For when they grew to neglect their ancient Discipline, that main∣tained and rewarded Virtue and Industry, and addicted themselves to <HI>Pleasure</HI> and <HI>Effeminacy,</HI> they debas'd their Spirits and debauch'd their Morals, from whence Ruine did never fail to follow to any People: With Justice therefore I deny the vulgar Opinion against <HI>Plantations, That they weaken</HI> England; they have manifestly inrich'd, and so strengthned her; Which I briefly evidence thus.</P>
<P N="1">1st. Those that go into a Foreign <HI>Plantation,</HI> their Industry there is worth more than if they stay'd at home, the Product of their Labour being in Commodities of a superiour Nature to those of this <HI>Country.</HI> For Instance, What is an improved Acre in <HI>Jamaica</HI> or <HI>Barbadoes</HI> worth to an improved Acre in <HI>England?</HI> We know 'tis threetimes the value, and the product of it comes for <HI>England,</HI> and is usually paid for in <HI>English Growth</HI> and <HI>Manufacture.</HI> Nay, <HI>Virginia</HI> shews that an ordinary Industry in one man produces Three thousand pound weight of Tobacco and Twenty Barrels of Corn yearly: He feeds himself, and brings as much of Commodity into <HI>England</HI> besides as being return'd in the Growth and Workmanship of this Countrey, is much more than he could have spent here: Let it also be remembred, that the Three thousand weight of Tobacco brings in Three thousand Two-pences by way of Custom to the King, which makes Twenty five Pounds; An extraordinary Profit.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. More being produc'd and imported than we can spend here, we Export it to other Countries in <HI>Europe,</HI> which brings in Money, or the Growth of those Countries, which is the same thing; And this is the Advantage of the <HI>English</HI>-Merchants and Seamen.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Such as could not only not <HI>marry</HI> here, but hardly live and allow themselves Cloaths, do marry there, and bestow thrice more in all Necessaries and Conveniencies (and not a little in Ornamental things too) for themselves, their Wives and Children, both as to Ap∣parel and Houshold-stuff; which coming out of <HI>England, I say 'tis im∣possible that</HI> England <HI>should not be a considerable Gainer.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. But let it be consider'd, <HI>That the Plantations imploy many hundreds of Shipping, and many thousands of Seamen;</HI> which must be in divers respects an Advantage to <HI>England,</HI> being an Island, and by Na∣ture fitted for Navigation above any Countrey in <HI>Europe.</HI> This is fol∣lowed by other depending Trades, as <HI>Shipwrights, Carpenters, Sawyers, Hewers, Trunnel-makers, Joyners, Slopsellers, Dry-salters, Iron-workers,</HI> the <HI>Eastland-Merchants, Timber-sellers,</HI> and <HI>Victuallers,</HI> with many more Trades which hang upon <HI>Navigation:</HI> So that we may easily see the Ob∣jection (<HI>That Colonies or Plantations hurt</HI> England) is at least of no
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> strength, especially if we consider how many thousand <HI>Blacks</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> are also accomodated with <HI>Cloaths</HI> and many sorts of <HI>Tools</HI> and <HI>Ʋtensils</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> and that their <HI>Labour</HI> is mostly brought hither, which adds <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>People</HI> to the <HI>English Dominions.</HI> But 'tis further said, <HI>They injure</HI> England, <HI>in that they draw away too many of the people; for we are not so populous in the Countries as formerly:</HI> I say there are other reasons for that.</P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>Country-People</HI> are so extremely addicted to put their Children into Gentlemens Service, or send them to Towns to learn Trades, that <HI>Husbandry is neglected;</HI> and after a soft and delicate Usage there, they are for ever unfitted for the Labour of a <HI>Farming</HI> Life.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The <HI>Pride</HI> of the Age in its <HI>Attendance</HI> and <HI>Retinue</HI> is so gross and universal, that where a man of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a year formerly kept but four or five Servants, he now keeps more than twice the number; He must have a <HI>Gentleman</HI> to wait upon him in his Chambers, a <HI>Coach-man,</HI> a <HI>Groom</HI> or two, a <HI>Butler,</HI> a <HI>Man-Cook,</HI> a <HI>Gardner,</HI> two or three <HI>Lac∣ques,</HI> it may be an <HI>Huntsman,</HI> and a <HI>Faulkner,</HI> the Wife a <HI>Gentlewoman,</HI> and <HI>Maids accordingly:</HI> This was not known by our <HI>Ancestors</HI> of like Quality. This hinders the <HI>Plough</HI> and the <HI>Dairy,</HI> from whence they are taken, and instead of keeping People to Manly-labour, they are effe∣minated by a lazy and luxurious Living; But which is worse, these people <HI>rarely marry,</HI> tho' many of them do worse; but if they do, 'tis when they are in Age; And the reason is clear, because their usual <HI>Kee∣ping</HI> at their Masters is too great and costly for them with a Family at their own Charge, and they scarcely know how to live lower; so that too many of them chuse rather to vend their Lusts at an <HI>evil Ordinary</HI> than honestly Marry and Work: <HI>The excess and sloth of the Age not allowing of Marriage and the Charge that follows;</HI> all which hinders the increase of our People. If Men, they often turn either <HI>Souldiers,</HI> or <HI>Gamesters,</HI> or <HI>Highway-men.</HI> If Women, they too frequently <HI>dress themselves for a bad market,</HI> rather than know the <HI>Dairy</HI> again, or ho∣nestly return to <HI>Labour,</HI> whereby it happens that both the Stock of the Nation decays and the Issue is corrupted.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Of old time the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry</HI> spent their Estates in the Country, and that kept the people in it; and their Servants married and sate at easie Rents under their Masters favour, which peopled the place: Now the Great men (too much loving the Town and resorting to <HI>London</HI>) draw many people thither to attend them, who either don't marry; or if they do, they pine away their small gains in some petty Shop; for there are so many, they prey upon one another.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The Country being thus neglected, <HI>and no due Ballance kept between Trade and Husbandry, City and Country,</HI> the poor Country-man takes double Toil, and cannot (for want of hands) dress and manure his Land to the Advantage it formerly yielded him, yet must he pay the old Rents, which occasions Servants, and such Children as go not to Trades, to continue single, at least <HI>all their youthful time,</HI> which also ob∣structs the increase of our people.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The decay of some Country-manufactures (where no Provision is made to supply the people with a new way of living) causes the more Industrious to go abroad to seek their Bread in other Countries, and
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> gives the lazy an occasion to loiter and beg or do worse, by which means the Land <HI>swarms with Beggars:</HI> Formerly 'twas rare to find any asking <HI>Alms</HI> but the <HI>Maimed,</HI> or <HI>Blind,</HI> or <HI>very Aged;</HI> now thousands of both Sexes run up and down, both City and Country, that are sound and youthful, and able to work, with false Pretences and Certificates; nor is there any care taken to imploy or deter such Vagrants, which weakens the Country, as to People and Labour.</P>
<P>To which let me add, that the great <HI>Debauchery</HI> in this Kingdom has not only rendred many unfruitful when married, but they live not out half their time, through Excesses, which might be prevented by a vigo∣rous execution of our good Laws against corruption of manners. These and the like evils are the true grounds of the decay of our People in the Country, to say nothing of <HI>Plague</HI> and <HI>Wars:</HI> Towns and Cities can∣not complain of the decay of People, being more replenish'd than ever, especially <HI>London,</HI> which with reason helps the Country-man to this Objection. And though some do go to the <HI>Plantations,</HI> yet numbering the Parishes in <HI>England,</HI> and computing how many live more than die, and are born than buried, there goes not over to all the <HI>Plantations</HI> a fourth part of the yearly increase of the People. and when they are there, <HI>they are not</HI> (as I said before) <HI>lost to</HI> England, since they furnish them with much <HI>Cloaths, Houshold-stuff, Tools,</HI> and the like necessaries, and that in greater quantities than here their condition could have nee∣ded, or they could have bought, being there well to pass, that were but low here, if not poor; and now Masters of Families too, when here they had none, and could hardly keep themselves; and very often it happens that some of them, after their Industry and Success there have made them wealthy, they return and <HI>empty</HI> their Riches into <HI>England;</HI> one in this capacity being able to buy out twenty of what he was when he went over.</P>
<P>Thus much to justifie the Credit and Benefit of <HI>Plantations;</HI> wherein I have not sought to speak my Interest, but my Judgment; and I dare venture the success of it with all sober and considering men. I shall now proceed to give some account of my own concern.</P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>I shall say what may be necessary of the Place or Province.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Touch upon the Constitutions.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>Lay down the Conditions.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>Give my sense what persons will be fit to go.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly. <HI>What Ʋtensils, Furniture and Commodities are fit to carry with them, with the charge of the voyage, and what is first to be done and expected there for some time.</HI></P>
<P>And lastly, <HI>I shall give an Abstract of the Grant by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of</HI> England, <HI>that an account may be given of the Estate and Power granted to me thereby.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Something of the Place.</HEAD>
<P>The Place lies 600 miles nearer the Sun than <HI>England;</HI> for <HI>England</HI> begins at the 50th. Degree and ten minutes of North Latitude, and this Place begins at fourty, which is about the Latitude of <HI>Naples</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> or <HI>Mompellier</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> I shall say little in its praise, to excite desires in any, whatever I could truly write as to the Soil, Air and Water: This shall satisfie me, that by the <HI>Blessing</HI> of God, and the honesty and industry of Man, it may be a good and fruitful Land.</P>
<P>For <HI>Navigation</HI> it is said to have two conveniencies; the one by lying
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> Ninescore miles upon <HI>Delaware</HI> River; that is to say, about three∣score and ten miles, before we come to the <HI>Falls,</HI> where a Vessel of Two hundred Tuns may Sail, (and some Creeks and small Harbours in that distance, where Ships may come nearer than the River into the Country) and above the <HI>Falls,</HI> for Sloops and Boots, as I am informed, to the extent of the Patent. The other convenience is through <HI>Chespa∣peak-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>For Timber and other Wood there is variety for the use of man.</P>
<P>For <HI>Fowl, Fish,</HI> and <HI>Wild-Deer,</HI> they are reported to be plentiful in those Parts. Our <HI>English</HI> Provision is likewise now to be had there at rea∣sonable Rates. The Commodities that the Country is thought to be <HI>capable</HI> of, are <HI>Silk, Flax, Hemp, Wine, Sider, Woad, Madder, Liquorish, Tobacco, Pot-ashes,</HI> and <HI>Iron,</HI> and it does actually produce <HI>Hides, Tallow, Pipe staves, Beef, Pork, Sheep, Wool, Corn,</HI> as <HI>Wheat, Barly, Ry,</HI> and also <HI>Furs,</HI> as your <HI>Peltree, Mincks, Racoons, Martins,</HI> and such like; store of <HI>Furs</HI> which is to be found among the <HI>Indians,</HI> that are profita∣ble Commodities in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The way of trading in those Countries is thus: they send to the Southern Plantations <HI>Corn, Beef, Pork, Fish</HI> and <HI>Pipe-staves,</HI> and take their Growth and bring for <HI>England,</HI> and return with <HI>English</HI> Goods to their own Country. Their <HI>Furs</HI> they bring for <HI>England,</HI> and either sell them here, or carry them out again to other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> where they will yield a better price: And for those that will follow <HI>Merchandize</HI> and <HI>Navigation</HI> there is conveniency, and <HI>Timber sufficient for Shipping.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>II. The Constitutions.</HEAD>
<P><HI>For the Constitution of the Country, the Patent shows, first,</HI> That the People and Governour have a Legislative Power, so that no Law can be made, nor Money raised, but by the Peoples consent.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That the Rights and Freedoms of <HI>England (the best and largest in</HI> Europe) shall be in force there.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. That making no Law against Allegiance (<HI>which should we, 'twere by the Law of</HI> England <HI>void of it self that moment</HI>) we may Enact what Laws we please for the good prosperity and security of the said Province.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>That so soon as any are ingaged with me, we shall begin a</HI> Scheam <HI>or</HI> Draught <HI>together, such as shall give ample Testimony of my sincere Incli∣nations to encourage Planters, and settle a free, just and industrious</HI> Colo∣ny <HI>there.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>III. The Conditions.</HEAD>
<P>My Conditions will relate to three sorts of people: <HI>1st.</HI> Those that will <HI>buy: 2dly.</HI> Those that take up Land upon <HI>Rent: 3dly.</HI> Servants. To the first, the Shares I sell shall be certain as to number of Acres; that is to say, every one shall contain Five thousand Acres, free from any <HI>Indian</HI> in∣cumbrance, the price a hundred pounds, and for the Quit-rent but one <HI>English</HI> shilling or the value of it yearly for a hundred Acres; and the said Quit-Rent not to begin to be paid till <HI>1684.</HI> To the second sort, that take up Land upon Rent, they shall have liberty so to do paying yearly <HI>one peny</HI> per Acre, not exceeding Two hundred Acres. To the third sort, to wit, <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> that are carried over, Fifty Acres shall be allowed to the Master for every Head, and Fifty Acres to every Servant when their time is expired.
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> And because some engage with me that may not be disposed to go, it were very advisable for every three Adventurers to send an Overseer with their Ser∣vants, which would well pay the Cost.</P>
<P>The <HI>Divident</HI> may be thus; if the persons concern'd please, a Tract of Land shall be survey'd; say <HI>Fifty thousand Acres to a hundred Adven∣turers;</HI> in which some of the best shall be set out for Towns or Cities; and there shall be so much Ground allotted to each in those Towns as may main∣tain some Cattel and produce some Corn; then the remainder of the fifty thousand Acres shall be shar'd among the said <HI>Adventurerers</HI> (ca∣sting up the Barren for Commons, and allowing for the same) whereby every <HI>Adventurer</HI> will have a considerable quantity of Land together; likewise every one a proportion by a Navigable River, and then backward into the Country. The manner of divident I shall not be strict in; we can but speak roughly of the matter here; but let men skilful in <HI>Plantations</HI> be consulted, and I shall leave it to the majority of votes among the <HI>Adventurers</HI> when it shall please God we come there, how to fix it to their own content.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IV. These persons that providence seems to have most fitted for Plantations are,</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>1st.</HI> Industrious <HI>Husbandmen</HI> and <HI>Day-Labourers,</HI> that are hardly able (with extreme Labour) to maintain their Families and portion their Children.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> Laborious <HI>Handicrafts,</HI> especially <HI>Carpenters, Masons, Smiths, Weavers, Taylors, Tanners, Shoemakers, Shipwrights,</HI> &amp;c. where they may be spared or are low in the World: And as they shall want no en∣couragement, so their Labour is worth more there than here, and there pro∣vision cheaper.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> A Plantation seems a fit place for those <HI>Ingenious Spirits</HI> that being low in the World, are much clogg'd and oppress'd about a Livelyhood, for the means of subsisting being easie there, they may have time and oppor∣tunity to gratify their inclinations, and thereby improve Science and help Nurseries of people.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4thly.</HI> A fourth sort of men to whom a <HI>Plantation</HI> would be proper, takes in those that are <HI>younger Brothers</HI> of small Inheritances; yet because they would live in sight of their Kindred in some proportion to their Quality, and can't do it without a labour that looks like <HI>Farming,</HI> their condition is too strait for them; and if married, their Children are often too numerous for the Estate, and are frequently bred up to no Trades, but are a kind of <HI>Hangers on or Retainers to the elder Brothers Table and Charity:</HI> which is a mischief, as in it self to be lamented, so here to be remedied; For Land they have for next to nothing, which with moderate Labour produces plenty of all things necessary for Life, and such an increase as by Traffique may supply them with all conveniencies</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> There are another sort of persons, not only fit for, but necessary in <HI>Plantations,</HI> and that is, <HI>Men of universal Spirits,</HI> that have an eye to the Good of Posterity, and that both understand and delight to promote good Discipline and just Government among a plain and well intending people; such persons may find <HI>Room in Colonies for their good Counsel and Con∣trivance,</HI> who are shut out from being of much use or service to great Nati∣ons
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> under settl'd Customs: These men deserve much esteem, and would be hearken'd to. Doubtless 'twas this <HI>(as I observ'd before)</HI> that put some of the famous <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> upon Transplanting and Regulating <HI>Colo∣nies</HI> of People in divers parts of the World; whose Names, for giving so great proof of their Wisdom, Virtue, Labour and Constancy, are with Justice honourably delivered down by story to the praise of our own times; though the World, after all its higher pretences of Religion, barbarously errs from their excellent Example.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>V. The Journey and it's Appurtenances, and what is to be done there at first coming.</HEAD>
<P>Next let us see, <HI>What is fit for the Journey and Place, when there, and also what may be the Charge of the Voyage, and what is to be ex∣pected and done there at first.</HI> That such as incline to go, may not be to seek here, or brought under any disappointments there. The <HI>Goods</HI> fit to take with them for use, or sell for profit, are all sorts of Apparel and Ʋtensils for Husbandry and Building and Houshold Stuff. And because I know how much People are apt to fancy things beyond what they are, and that Imma∣ginations are great flatterers of the minds of Men; To the end that none may delude themselves, with an expectation of an Immediate Amendment of their conditions, so soon as it shall please God they Arrive there; I would have them understand, <HI>That they must look for a Winter before a Sum∣mer comes;</HI> and they must be willing to be two or three years without some of the conveniences they enjoy at home; And yet I must needs say that <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> is another thing then it was at the first Plantation of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>New-England:</HI> For there is better Accommodation, and <HI>English</HI> Provisions are to be had at easier rates: However, I am inclin'd to set down par∣ticulars, as near as those inform me, that know the Place, and have been Planters both in that and in the Neighbouring <HI>Colonys.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1st.</HI> The passage will come for Masters and Mistresses at most to <HI>6</HI> Pounds a Head, for Servants Five Pounds a Head, and for Children under Seven years of Age Fifty Shillings, except they Suck, then nothing.</P>
<P>Next being by the mercy of God, safely Arrived in <HI>September</HI> or <HI>Octo∣ber,</HI> two Men may clear as much Ground by Spring (when they set the Corn of that Country) as will bring in that time twelve month Forty Barrels, which amounts to two Hundred Bushels, which makes Twenty Five quarters of Corn. So that the first year they must buy Corn, which is usually very plentiful. They may so soon as they come, buy <HI>Cows,</HI> more or less, as they want, or are able, which are to be had at easy rates. For <HI>Swine,</HI> they are plentiful and cheap; these will quickly Increase to a Stock. So that after the first year, what with the Poorer sort, sometimes labouring to others, and the more able <HI>Fishing, Fowling,</HI> and sometime Buying; They may do very well, till their own Stocks are sufficient to supply them, and their Families, which will quickly be and to spare, if they follow the <HI>English Husbandry,</HI> as they do in <HI>New-England,</HI> and <HI>New-York;</HI> and get Winter Fodder for their Stock.</P>

<P>To conclude, I desire all my dear Country-Folks, who may be inclin'd to go into those Parts, to consider seriously the premises, <HI>as well the present inconveniences, as future ease and Plenty,</HI> that so none may move rashly or from a fickle but solid mind, <HI>having above all things, an Eye to the providence of God, in the disposal of themselves.</HI> And I would further advise all such at least, to have the permission, if not the good liking of their near Relations, for that is both Natural, and a Duty In∣cumbent upon all; and by this means will natural affection be preser∣ved, and a friendly and profitable correspondence be maintained be∣tween them. In all which <HI>I beseech Almighty God to direct us, that his blessing may attend our honest endeavour, and then the Consequence of all our undertaking will turn to the Glory of his great Name, and the true hap∣piness of us and our Posterity.</HI> Amen.</P>
