<P>SINCE my last, of the Action of Major General <HI>Scravemore</HI> and <HI>Tetau,</HI> and that of <HI>Levison</HI>'s Dra∣goons, we have receiv'd the fol∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owing Accounts from our Forces: That <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome Scouts of M. General <HI>Scravemore,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad Two days agoe brought to him Two Raparee Prisoners they had taken, who were sound to be Officers among <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, and very Intelligent Persons, up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n their Examination they could not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e brought to Confess any thing about their Associates, or where the chief Rende<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vous of any Numbers of them were, upon which one of them were immediately Executed, and Orders were given for the Execution of the other, upon which he consessed where a great Body of them were: The General im∣mediately ordered a strong Detachment to be sent with the Guide, who marched secretly by covered ways, till they came near to a Mountainous place, be∣tween which, in a great Vale, were got
<PB N="2" REF="2"/> together between Three and Four Thou∣sand of them, with a great quantity of Cattle, that they had gotten from the Counties adjacent (they were Carousing themselves, some taking of Snees, others Smoaking and Drinking;) upon the approach of our Forces, the Raparee Rebels gave a great Shout or Cry, like that of the <HI>Turks,</HI> seeming to come on with a great deal of Resolution; but on our Forces first Fire they immediately Fled, leaving their Prey of Cattle, and most of their Arms, among which were Fifty Silver Hilted Swords, supposed to belong to their Chief Officers: Our Forces pursued them with a great Slaughter, killing between Five and Six Hundred of them, and taking many Prisoners.</P>
<P>We likewise have an Account from <HI>Connaught</HI>-side, That the Body of the <HI>Irish,</HI> consisting of between Five and Six Thousand, that have been moving for some time, about the <HI>Shannon,</HI> Com∣manded by <HI>Sarsfield</HI> and others, hav∣ing crossed the <HI>Shannon</HI> and come on this side, they Marched with Five Can∣non to a strong Town and Castle called <HI>Bir,</HI> which belonged to one Sir <HI>Lawrence Parsons,</HI> it's Scituated within Two Miles of the <HI>Shannon,</HI> Fifty Two from <HI>Dublin,</HI> and as many from <HI>Cork,</HI> and being come within Two Hundred Yards of the Place, they sent a Summons to the Governor to Surrender, who had in it a Garrison of about Eighty Soldi∣ers, besides Townsmen in Arms; the Governor sent back a Resolute Answer, That he knew no King but King <HI>William,</HI> for whom he kept the Castle, and to whom he hoped to be able to give a good Account of his Trust, by a Resolute De∣fence; on which the Enemy raised a Battery with their Cannon, from whence they Played pretty briskly on the Place; the Garrison at the same time (and while the Battery was raising) Played as briskly from the Castle on the Enemy, and killed a great many of their Men; while this was doing, Lieutenant Gene∣ral <HI>Douglas;</HI> and Sir <HI>John Lanier,</HI> who were going in Pursuit of <HI>Sarsfield</HI> and his Parties, hearing the Guns Play too<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Alarm, and by their Scouts or Ad∣vanced Parties, had Advice brough<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, that the Enemy had laid Siege to <HI>Bir,</HI> on which they immediately March∣ed thither with their whole Force, upon whose Approach the Enemy raised th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Siege, and retired over the <HI>Shannon</HI> a¦gain, leaving their Cannon and Baggage and about 160 of their Company Dea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the Place, which had been Killed b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Cannon from the Garrison.</P>
<P>We have an Account from all hands That the <HI>Irish</HI> are fallen under miserabl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Necessities, and what is more to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Comfort, things are like to grow muc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worse with the Rog<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s. The Train'd Bands or Militia of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he several Coun¦ties, Cities, and Towns in Their Ma¦jesties Possession, are Raising, and man<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Raised and Armed to be in a posture <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assist in Defending the Country Peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Winter from the Insolencies and Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦lanies of the Raparees.

The great∣est Want we fear this Winter is Coal for Firing.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Clovesly Shovel,</HI> with his whol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fleet, came into the Bay of <HI>Waterfor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Two Days since, and we hear he is Sail¦ing again towards the Coast of <HI>Galway</HI> in search of some <HI>French</HI> that we hea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is Crusing there-abouts; but we hea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not one Word of the Grand Fleet.</P>
