<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THere is certainly a very Pretious, Noble, Royal, Long-Suffering Seed of the Eternal God of Hea∣ven and Earth, the which in these latter dayes of our age since the long night of Apostacy [from Christ and his Holy Apostles and Saints life] to which the Eternal Arm of the Lord God is manifestly revealed unto eternal Salvation and perfect Redemption, in and by the <HI>Light</HI> of the Lord Jesus (the Immanuel) who as truly <HI>light∣eth every man,</HI> as he tasted <HI>Death</HI> for every man that cometh into the World, and this pretious Seed which is the <HI>Light</HI> that is sown for the Righteous,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">And the People become perfect∣ly Righteous that believe in and obey the same light of Jesus, and are there∣by made partakers of the Righteous∣ness, and so of the same nature of God, which comes to be revealed from faith to saith in Male and Female, for which end the light which is the Seed is sown in the heart, is the Light shines in darkness which com∣prehends not that which is the trea∣sure in the earthen Vessel as a pearl hid in a field, and is the good thing which can give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.19. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.</NOTE> the same hath been visited from on high as a thing hid in ob∣scurity in many, under the Region and Shaddow of Death and Destruction, so that it hath been quick∣ned and revived mightily to the amazement and a∣stonishment of Kindreds, Nations, Tongues and peo∣ples because of the arm of the Lords Salvation, with which he hath arisen in his Majesty and shaken terribly
<PB REF="3"/> the Earth and Heavens also, and made the Keepers of the strong Mans House to tremble, and by his power of ho∣liness to bind him and spoile his goods; So that the ever∣lasting <HI>Light</HI> hath sent his Word (of Power) into <HI>Jacob,</HI> and it hath lighted upon Poor distressed <HI>Israel,</HI> in whose house he, the Lord God (that Spirit) hath promised to dwell in the midst for ever, as in the <HI>Antient dayes,</HI> and many of the Eternal Off-spring of Life which is the <HI>Light of men,</HI> having gladly received the Word of Life, not from man nor by man that shall dye, but from his mouth, <HI>that was dead and is alive, and behold he liveth for evermore,</HI> that leads his Flock like a good Shepherd to Living Springs and Fountains, which are as wells <HI>spring∣ing up into everlasting Life,</HI> in them that believe, as the Scripture hath said, <HI>John 4. John. 7.38.30.</HI></P>
<P>And these as Lambs among Wolves, having the blessed Life and Salvation to Proclaim in Faithfulness, travelling in their innocent integrity on this wise, as our Brethren the Prophets and Fathers of old did from one Na∣tion to another People; Now why are the Nations angry? and why do the Mighty and Potentates of the Earth com∣bine and take Counsel together against the Lord and his <HI>Anointed?</HI> Is it not because the Eternal God is provo∣king them to jealousie and to anger with a foolish Nation, with them which are deemed not a People, who are Poor, Afflicted, Despised, Destressed on every hand, yet not forsaken of the Lord their Rock, their Strength, <HI>Deut. 32.</HI></P>
<P>Now it came to pass that after the Lord God <HI>[who formeth the Mountains and Createth the Wind which obeyeth him,] Amos. 4. last.</HI> had given three more of my Brethren together with me a good passage from the Land of our Nativity to <HI>Italy,</HI> namely, to <HI>Legorne,</HI> where two of us, (to wit) <HI>John Stubs</HI> and <HI>Henry Fell,</HI>
<PB REF="3"/> was ordered of the Lord to passe from thence towards <HI>Alex∣andria</HI> and they became obedient; and it came to pass also by the permission of God who suffered the men of our own Nation to Banish and expel them away from that Region and Coast, where they gave a sound of the <HI>Mighty Day of Gods visitation,</HI> and saith Christ, <HI>as they have done unto me, so will they do unto you, &amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Gada∣renes</HI> loved their Swine and besought Christ to depart out of their Coast, and them that Rebel against the <HI>Light,</HI> saith, <HI>depart from us</HI> (even to the most High) <HI>for we de∣sire not the knowledge of thy wayes,</HI> Job. <HI>21.</HI> Job. <HI>24. 13, 14.</HI></P>
<P>And furthermore my Dear Brother <HI>Richard Scostrope</HI> my Companion in Tribulation and in the Power of God, by which we were also ordered (having no imposition from any mortal man on our Consciences God is witness) was ordained of God to pass Eastward, towards <HI>Asia,</HI> namely, to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> intending also to travel further (if the Lord suffered not Sathan to hinder;) and behold when we came there, having enjoyed the benefit of a good passage, that the Merchants and Great men and others of our own Na∣tion did not a little perplex and burthen themselves not only at our bodily presence, but also with our faithful and true innocent and harmless message of life, and glad ti∣dings of Salvation to the Nations, and verily they cannot deny but that our behaviour and deportment (if they speak truth) was such as we professed in Words and Doctrine in all good Conversation whilest we abode among them, as examples in the manifold Dispensations of the grace of God Almighty, to whom be the Glory over all, <HI>A∣men.</HI></P>
<P>We being at our first coming sent for before the Consul of the Nation, gave him a good and sober information of the intent of our hearts as God had ordered and determi∣ned
<PB REF="4"/> in some measure (to try them) and he said that he must give account to the Lord Ambassadour and send ti∣dings to <HI>Constantinople</HI> to him, and he could not suffer us to pass further till he had received information in an∣swer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now we saw not of our departure from <HI>Smyr∣na</HI> imediately, and seeing that they did intend to write, many of them being evil affected with prejudice and such like surmisings against us that loved them, and travelled in the love and Spirit of Gods Truth for their eternal good freely, albeit they hated us without cause as it befell our Lord and Master; I also was moved in the fear of the Lord to write and give the Ambassadour an honest and true information of the intent of our hearts, to the end he might be honestly warned of receiving any evil and false intelligence that he may not consent with the same, nor with the ground of it to joyn or stretch forth his hand therewith against the Lord, his Truth and innocent Peo∣ple.</P>

<P>THE Copy of the Letter is seen meet to be inserted here following, seeing the same was made leight of, and rejected as a thing of nought, as many have done to their own hurt and condemnation, namely, <HI>O. C.</HI> and the many Parliaments in their dayes past, in which the Eternal God tryed them (what if I say to the uttermost) before he smote, and broke and shattered them to pieces as Potters Vessells, and wherled them up and down as Clouds of Tempests and Darkness, as it were from one end of the Land to the other in his sore displeasure (in the sight of the Nations, to the final destruction of many of them that tur∣ned the back; Albeit they seemed to have their face towards the good Day of their Visitation from on High, which they wofully sinned away, and the just recompence of reward as a fruit of their own doings, even in the sight of the Nati∣ons, fell upon them as a weight too heavy for them to bear, and as great judgements from the same Hand of God is re∣served in store, and is ready to be revealed and executed up∣on the Heads of them that walk in the same wayes and paths of unrighteousnesse, which provokes the Lord to his Face, I speak not on this wise to (upbraid without the Fear of the Lord) the generation thats passed away, and seems to be laid in the dust of the Earth, but rather that the present ge∣neration of men, of what Name or Denomination they were, are or may be under, that have but somewhat of the Fear and Zeal of the God of Truth in their Hearts, thereby to be warned in their day, and not to make the evil example of a∣ny to be so to them, as evil to follow it, nay but contrari∣wise, which is so far acceptable to God, for <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomo∣rah</HI> and the old World, were and are evident examples of the sore displeasure of the Eternal God of vengeance, to whom it peculiarly and properly belongeth, and he will certainly repay <HI>Fury to his Adversaries, and Recompence to his Enemies,</HI> when he awakes and stirs up his strength as <HI>a MIGHTY ONE (the KING, the Lord of Hosts is his Name)</HI> to bend his Bow, and whet his glittering Sword, he will cast up, cut down
<PB N="8" REF="5"/> and overturn, and not spare to spend his Arrows of famine and destruction, and let them fly with his outstretched Arm of strength, to smite and strike into the Hearts of the double-minded, so that his anger shall smoak in the fiery Zeal of his Eternal Majesty against such a one, that being often repro∣ved, goeth on still in his iniquities, he shall suddenly be de∣stroyed, and that without remedy, as saith one in a certain place, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29. yet the Nations of men may certainly un∣derstand that the most High holds forth his Eternal Name, as he is the Lord God, long suffering and of great goodness, nei∣ther delighteth he in the destruction of any, but rather in their return unto the Wisdom of the Just, unto Eternal Life in it to live for ever, and not to die in their sins, for as he is the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> and his <HI>Holy One</HI> for a <HI>flame,</HI> and a consuming fire to burn up Bryars and Thorns against the workers of Iniquity, so is he a God of Judgement, <HI>and blessed are all they that wait for his Salvation,</HI> and put their trust in him, he will shew them his Covenant, and establish them in the same, in which they shall not be confounded, neither be ashamed, nor yet shall any make them afraid, but quiet∣ness and assurance for ever shall be their reward in Eternal Peace and Blessedness, together with him and the Spirits of Just men made perfect, on this wise my Soul in life breath∣eth and travels for the Restauration of all things, into the Glorious Liberty and Freedom of the harmless Sons of God.</P>
<P>Verily, the Eternal love of my God thats shed abroad within my heart, its much enlarged to stream forth Uni∣versally, even to the whole Creation that travels in pain under the Bondage of Corruption, over which mine eyes have poured forth many tears, and in the brokennesse of my very heart have I dolefully Lamented and Mourned for the same, but at present, I am necessitated to proceed on to what is before mine eye, as I have began concerning this little Treatise.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="14"/> to powder on whom it falls <HI>(whose light is like unto a stone most pretious clear as Chrystal)</HI> according to the prophesie of the e∣ternal Spirit of holiness, and verily the mercy and goodness and knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, the same shall fill the Earth and abundantly stream forth, and spread its virtue and excellent power over all Na∣tions, and flow plentifully even to the ends and uttermost parts of the Earth from Sea to Sea and to the utmost extent or circumference of its bounds; the Lord, the Lord of eter∣nity in his own life, and by the Almightinesse of his own Arm thats revealed and manifest in the midst of his poor afflicted and despised, yet honourable people, against whom you have magnified your selves to your own hurt, in and by whom, without visible weapons of war, will he even our Lord perform the same and much more, and many both on the right hand and on the left shall break forth as a mighty flood, or as the Stars of the Firmament of the power of the everlasting Light, and many shall fear and tremble, because of the abundance of peace and truth, that is, and is yet to be revealed even in them that turn from ungodlinesse to the Light of the Lord who enlighteneth the poor, and deceitful mans eyes, the Lord enlightneth both their eyes saith the wise man, and the poor man is guided in obedience to the same light which justifieth him, and condemneth the deceitful man that hates it, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29. so he that doth evil hateth the Light which is not Salvation but Condemnation to the evil doer, as Christ saith, <HI>John the</HI> 3d. And blessed shall the man be that believeth in, and obeyeth the Light of the Lord ma∣nifest in him, to guide him into all Truth from all the con∣trary, and the Nations shall be asnamed and confounded be∣cause of all the goodness that the eternal God of Judgement will perform unto, and in the blessed and beloved obedient Seed of his bowels, thats to be gathered from the four winds and ends of the Earth where they have been (in the dark night of Apostacy) scattered.</P>
<P>Wherefore with my single voice behold I cry unto you, yet by the same Eternal Spirit of Life and Prophesie, take heed and beware least that therefore come upon you, which is spoken of in the Prophets, saying, <HI>Behold ye dispisers and
<PB N="28" REF="15"/> Wonder, and Perish, the Lord is working a work in your dayes, which you will in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you;</HI> and whether you hear or forbear, the Scripture do I witness fulfilled in me, in the answer of a Good Conscience, according to the Compleat and Perfect Example of my Lord and Master, whom I Fear and follow, and serve, in the Fellowship of his Reproaches &amp; Sufferings in the Gospel Life and Peace, <HI>viz.</HI> The Lord God hath opened mine ear, (Blessed be his Glory Amen) and I was not Rebellious a∣gainst him, neither turned away back; I gave my back to the smiter, and my check to them that plucked off the Hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting, my God knoweth right well, in obedience to his will the same is done, being called to the Fellowship of the same Sufferings and Glory of Gods Lamb, and to indure the contradictions of ungodly sinners, as he did, yea, the Lord God will help me, there∣fore shall I not be confounded; thou hast made my face like a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>line, and I know that I shall not be ashamed, he is near that justifieth, who shall contend with me?</P>

<PB N="29" REF="15"/>
<HEAD>A Loving Visitation, tendred to the <HI>English</HI> Merchants in <HI>Genoa,</HI> who received it not.</HEAD>
<P>Friends, <HI>Read and Honestly consider with the Spirit of Modera∣tion, for whether you will hear or forbear, this is that you may well understand, that in the first place,</HI></P>
<P>THE most Holy Faith of Gods Elect (without which its impossible to please God) its not of that Nature, to <HI>Respect Persons,</HI> neither to give <HI>flattering Titles</HI> to any man, (which are of the vain inventions of vain man) but to honour, or well esteem all men in the Truth, Fear and Reverence of God, the which is to have the Pecu∣liar and Supream Preheminence in every mans Conscience, and so to rule over the whole Creation of God, that the Eter∣nal Blessing of the Invisible and Immortal God, by Jesus Christ the <HI>True Light</HI> of the world, may come upon all, in the true Seed which is ordained to <HI>bruise the Serpents Head,</HI> and to destroy the Devil and his unfruitful works of Dark∣ness in man, the which captivateth and defileth (and also is destructive to) the Creation, over which the true Seed is to Rule, who is the True Light which lighteth every man, and is the Way, the Life, the Truth, a manifestation of the same is in every man, in Male and in Female, it shines in darkness (in man) and the same would guide them out of, and from every unjust way, word, thought and action, yea and from all unequitableness, into truth and uprightnesse, wherein the Riches of Eternal Peace and Felicity may come, and in the same be possessed within the heart of every particular, even in the midst of the sons of men, to the Glory of the Everlasting Fountain of Life, from whence the true Property and pure nature of every good thing receiveth vertue to subsist according to the excellent and unsearchable wisdom and decree of the Divine Substance or Eternal Being of the Majesty of the Heavenly
<PB N="30" REF="16"/> Power of the Everlasting Light, who is the True and Living God over all, blessed for ever, Amen.</P>
<P>Now to the end that prejudice and evil surmisings (which are not of God the Father of all Truth) may be removed out of the minds of the men of my own Nation <HI>(viz.) Eng∣lish,</HI> or any others that burthen themselves because I can∣not give, neither receive the honour of the world, with its Ceremonies and flattering Titles, either to my self or to a∣ny man, and I am willing to testifie, that its not in any con∣tempt to the persons (which are the workmanship of the Eternal God) of the sons of men, but for Conscience sake, that I use not the same as in times past, and because I am well perswaded in the Grace of God, and perfectly satisfied in the same measure in my own particular; therefore in that love which thinks no evil, I am moved to give forth some reasonable and true words, to a good end as aforesaid, which are not contrary to God, neither to the example of just and honourable men, nor to the Holy Scriptures of Truth, which saith to the True Christians, <HI>If you respect persons ye commit sin, and are convinced by the Law as Transgressors,</HI> saith the A∣postle <HI>James, James</HI> 2.9. <HI>And there is no respect of persons with the Lord, who will judge righteously according to every mans work</HI> saith <HI>Peter,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.17. And ye shall do no unrighteousnesse in judgement, <HI>Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the Mighty,</HI> (mark that) <HI>but in Righteousnesse shalt thou judge thy Neighbour,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>Deut.</HI> 19.15. <HI>And I say unto you, that for every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgement, for by thy words thou shalt be justifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and by thy words thou shalt be con∣demned, saith Jesus, Mat.</HI> 12.36, 37. I testifie that the light of Christ Jesus in every mans Conscience, will clearly shew or manifest to mans understanding, what words, thoughts and intentions are justifiable, and what are also condemna∣ble; wherefore my spirit of life is ready to say, Blessed is and shall the man be who suffereth his mind to be guided by the pure and true manifestation of the Eternal light, which is of the Nature of God manifest within, as it is written, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.19, 20. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.7. <HI>For the manifestation of the Spirit</HI> (which is true) <HI>is given to every man to profit withall,</HI> and they that
<PB N="31" REF="16"/> profit not by the same, shall certainly receive the un∣profitable servants portion, not to Salvation, but con∣trariwise unto perdition, which is the just reward of them, which not onely reject the Truth and receive it not in the love of the same, but also take pleasure in unrighteousness, and so provoke the Lord to his Face, and defie and condemn the just in themselves, and the Generation of the Righteous also in the General, <HI>but yee shall not walk in the manners of the Nations, which I cast out before you,</HI> saith God to the true Seed, <HI>for they commit∣ted all these things, and therefore I abhorred them,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>Levit.</HI> 20. <HI>let not me I pray you respect the person of any, neither let me give flattering Titles unto men, for I know not to give flattering Titles, in so doing my Maker would soon take me away, Job</HI> 32. he will surely reprove you if ye secretly respect persons, <HI>shall not his excellency make You afraid, Job</HI> 13. but they that are taking pleasure in di∣vers lusts and vanities, which maketh war against the Immortal soul, and wounds the spirit of the just, these are they that are of one and the same Nature and Gene∣ration that the holy and perfect man saw in his dayes (who feared God and departed from evil) <HI>which rebel against the light, they know not the wayes thereof, neither a∣bide in the paths thereof,</HI> who also say as they did to the Most High, <HI>depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy wayes, Job.</HI> 24.13, 14. <HI>Job</HI> 21. But God shall wound the Head of his Enemies, and spend his Arrows of Famine and Destruction upon such as being often reproved, yet hardneth their necks, and go on still in the way that is not holinesse, rushing mightily into sin and transgression, without fear or amazement, even as the Horse rusheth into the Battel, and so greedily drink down iniquities even as the Ox drinketh water, yea and hate to be reformed, which is the greatest evil, which hardneth their impenitent hearts the more unto perdi∣tion. Wo and alass for them that sit in darkness, un∣der the shadow of Death and Destruction, before their day of Visitation finally pass away over their heads, when
<PB N="32" REF="17"/> they inexcusably may be left to cry out in the Anguish and Vexation of Spirit, saying, <HI>How have we wilfully and rebelliously despised, and stifneckedly defyed the day of healing and saving health,</HI> and then say I, <HI>Dives</HI> his nature that fared sumptuously every day in excess and fulness, shall sensibly discern the nature of poor <HI>Lazarus</HI> and its reward, and also that which is of the flesh, the first birth, and the lust thereof which is contrary to, and warreth against the spirit and its birth, and then the two seeds may be discerned the one from the other, the seed of God from the seed of the Serpent, <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abels</HI> na∣ture and worship, <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacobs</HI> nature, the <HI>prophane person,</HI> and the <HI>plain man,</HI> the hunting nature, and that which is obedient, quiet and dwells <HI>within,</HI> at home in his Tent; <HI>Isaak</HI> and <HI>Ismael,</HI> the seed of Bondage from beneath, and the free born from Above, the scoffer which is to be cast out, &amp; the beloved Heir of the Promise which is to abide within, in the Fathers House for ever, for the seed of Bondage is not to be heir with the Free-born, neither to that seed do I write the words of my living and true Testimony, but to that which is just in every mans Conscience, in the sight of God do I desire to be manifest, and so I shall be a sweet savour, not on∣ly in them that believe, but also in them that perish, and if any have an ear to hear let him for his good.</P>
<P>And what if I say in truth on this wise, because the Fear and Reverence of the Living Eternal Invisible God is set up within my heart, therefore (and not otherwise) I cannot respect the persons of any, neither give or re∣ceive the Honour and Glory of the world, Christ Jesus my Lord being my Perfect and Compleat Example, also who saith, <HI>I receive not honour from man,</HI> and his very enemies who came to provoke, and tempt, and insnare him, they discerned that he was a Just man, and that he respected not the person of any, as it is written of him, that said to unbelievers on this wise, <HI>How can you believe which receive honour one of another, and seek not the ho∣nour which cometh from God onely, John</HI> 5. Mark that.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="17"/>
<P>And I am right well and favourably perswaded that as any of the Sons of men come to be honestly guided by a just, steadfast and equal Principle of God, as is the <HI>Light</HI> of Christ <HI>within them,</HI> to walk thereby in a just path, and equitable way, and in the same, at all times to speak true, fast, sound, savoury and uncondemnable words and such like actions to all with whom they have to do, and not to be hurtful or destructive to the Crea∣tion of God, but also doing in the same light just and equitable things to all even as they would be done by, according to the perfect doctrine of Christ, the Law and the Prophets, I say the same will testifie for them, and make them truly honourable, and draw down Bles∣sings, and not the contrary; and so in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted of him, and these things will be acceptable and justifica∣ble and not condemnable in the sight and presence of the everlasting God, and so the true honour comes to be manifest which comes from God, whose eternal eye, the <HI>Light</HI> perfectly discerneth, and seeth into, and wisely searcheth every mans heart <HI>within,</HI> and God is not devided from his eye, for as God is said to be a spi∣rit, so he is light, 1 <HI>Epist. John</HI> 1. from which no secret work of darkness can in any wise be hid, all be it the same be acted never so secretly. And behold I testifie in his Name that is true, that the sound of his mighty day is come to the Nations, and the same terrible and glorious day hath begun to dawn in <HI>England</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI> and behold his everlasting Light is arising over all Nations even the <HI>Light</HI> of the Lord Jesus who light∣neth the poor and deceitful mans eyes, yea he lightneth every man that cometh into the world with the Light that is perfect and true, either to condemn or justifie e∣very mans words, thoughts and actions, and this per∣fect Light of eternity is manifestly arisen up and hath its preheminence that is just in thousands to the glory of the Lord who worketh both to will and to do in them that fear him, and have received of the fulness of his life
<PB N="34" REF="18"/> in the same in which they live, and walk, and rest, and so are become a blessing to the Nations in the Light of his eternal Countenance, in whom also they have be∣lieved unto Salvation, the transparent brightness of which through such clouds of living witnesses, is shining forth over the Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and Peoples that have corrupted the Earth, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e degenerated and alienated in obscurity under a thick vail of darkness in the night of Apostacy since the Holy Apostles days, from the Light and Life of the Invisible and Immortal God and his Lamb the <HI>light</HI> who is coming in 10 thousands of his Saints to convince all of their ungodlike words, Hard-speeches, Thoughts and Actions, and to lead as many as receive and believe in the same Light with which they be enlightened from all sin and unrighteous∣nesse, and so from the condemnation of the same and wrath to come, even up to God the Father of all truth, from whence the Light, Life and every good thing com∣eth, according to the Prophesie of good old <HI>Enoch</HI> and the rest of the Prophets, and blessed shall the Man, the Family, the City, the Kingdom, the Nation be that doth not wilfully and rebelliously reject, but receive and accept of the good day of their Visitation of Salva∣tion, of which I am one that giveth a certain sound, be∣ing saved by the same Grace and Life of God (that bringeth Salvation, and appeareth to all men, to the end that they may be saved by it also, and redeemed from Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and Peoples, for all the Earth was of one Language before <HI>Babel</HI> or <HI>Nim∣rods</HI> Generation of Builders was, and the Holy scriptures saith, <HI>That he was a mighty hunter before the Lord,</HI> who did and will confound their many Languages and Tongues that are out of the Truth and Plainnesse, into which the sons of men are to be redeemed from the contrary, for which my soul in love to the whole Creation travelleth, and my spirit in the same is ready to say Amen, to the counsel of the Everlasting <HI>light</HI> in the truth, for the good and well-being of all the sons of men, under what name

<P><HI>This was Rejected and not received by them.</HI></P>
<P>THe Holy Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> as the Scripture saith, (in his life) which giveth testimony unto this day on this wise, (to wit) that <HI>all Asia had forsaken him,</HI> and what af∣ter there has been in these latter dayes among them cal∣led Christians, not only in <HI>Asia,</HI> but also in all parts of the World where the joyful sound hath come, but many rebell against the visitation of life and salvation, so that they have rejected the word of the Lord, and its Am∣bassadours of peace and saving health, which the most high hath sent to and among them, and as the hard-hearted Jews in unbelief cryed <HI>help men of Israel,</HI> against two poor harmless Lambs in those dayes of the Holy A∣postles, that were deemed by them to be such <HI>as turned the World upside down,</HI> and contrary to all men, on such wise the same voice hath been sounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth and lifted up unwisely by the same Spirit in <HI>Asia</HI> against two plain na∣ked Messengers and Ministers of Truth; But how is it
<PB N="36" REF="19"/> that wise men seem to be so vailed, or whats the matter that their understandings are so darkned from the Wis∣dom and the clear Spirit of discerning that of the Pure Immortal God, that they cannot see what they do, many of them whom my heart pitieth: Why should ye be so affraid of the harmless and guiltless that sounds the Message of undeniable Truth, even the Word of the Lord which is the Sword of the Spirit, whose wea∣pons are not carnal or visible, as <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Judas</HI>'s were, but Spiritual, with the same to make war against Spiri∣tual wickednesse, and to destroy and cut down that which rules even in high places, and in the Power of the Word Eternal to beat down and kill that which is hurtful and destructive to the Creation of God, in Na∣tions, Kingdoms, Thrones and Dominions, that the same Power of the gentle <HI>Lamb of God</HI> may rule in and over all as in the beginning, to the End that every man that liveth under the name or denomination of a Chri∣stian, may clearly and truly say from his very heart [without mocking or provoking God Eternal to his Face] viz. AS IT WAS IN THE BEGIN∣NING, SO IT IS NOW, AND EVER SHAL BE, And if the Sons of men did but suffer the fear of the Lord to possesse their hearts, and thereby honest∣ly consider the weight of these words which so many vainly and unwisely utter, they would in the first place fear and tremble, and not take the Name of the Lord so in vain, nor offer the sacrifice of fools. But alas, theres few see as it was in the beginning, or how it is now, or what shall be in the World which hath no end, which is the same which in the beginning was, in which is the life which is the light of men, which men hate, because their deeds are evil, which unfruitful works blinds the eye of a good and noble understanding, and therefore even a Magestrate, being so vailed, albeit in the place of Judicature, having a sword in his hand, lifts it up and beareth it against the just and guiltlesse, and so smites and wounds the Innocent, which should be
<PB N="37" REF="19"/> a terrour to the evil doer, and to them that do well not hurtful, but a praise; but otherwise it hath sadly hapned in Ages and Generations even unto this our day against the <HI>Lamb,</HI> and his appearance in and through his Members, who hath been wounded and slain since the foundation of the World: And so it comes to passe through many that are in one and the same nature of transgression, Even as a blind man, having a sword in his hand, being hasty and as it were mad, layes it he knows not where, and smites he knows not what; And so he was a wise man that said on this wise, to wit, <HI>Man being in honour and understandeth it not, is like the beast that perish.</HI></P>
<P>Now having a necessity in equitablenesse to give forth these writings to publick view to a good end, for the good of all that hear and dis∣cern between the things that are of a good re∣port from what is otherwise condemnable and not justifiable in the sight of God, neither of good men, and also seeing it is so, that plain Truth and its Friends, Followers and Messengers among the Nations (as its their portion to passe through the contradictions and manifold suffer∣ings and reproaches of Christ their compleat ex∣ample) are daily beset with the same afflictions, and false reports from multitudes that are say∣ing with open mouth, as in the dayes of the Pro∣phets, <HI>Report say they, and we will report,</HI> yet we delight not to Retaliate any more then a good necessity from God Almighty lyeth on us, to give testimony for his Truth and Name and peo∣ples sake, for on this wise did the holy Prophets and Apostles as the holy Scriptures of Truth
