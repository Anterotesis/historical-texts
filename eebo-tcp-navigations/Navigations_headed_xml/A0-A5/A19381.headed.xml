<L>Vnto thy little <HI>Microcosme</HI> belongs,</L>
<L>That to what place soeuer thou doost walk,</L>
<L>Thou wilt lose nothing through the want of talke.</L>
<L>For thou canst kisse thy hand, and make a legge,</L>
<L>And wisely canst in any language begge,</L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>
And sure to begge 'tis pollicie (I note)</L>
<L>It sometimes saues the cutting of thy throat:</L>
<L>For the worst thiefe that euer liu'd by stealth,</L>
<L>Will neuer kill a beggar for his wealth.</L>
<L>But who is't but thy wisedome doth admire,</L>
<L>That doth vnto such high conceits aspire.</L>
<L>Thou tak'st the bounty of each bounteous giuer,</L>
<L>And drink'st the liquor of the running riuer:</L>
<L>Each Kitchin where thou com'st, thou hast a Cooke,</L>
<L>Thou neuer run'st on score vnto the Brooke;</L>
<L>For if thou didst, the Brooke and thou would'st gree,</L>
<L>Thou runst from it, and it doth run from thee.</L>
<L>In thy returne from <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Assmere</HI></L>
<L>By thy relation following doth appeare,</L>
<L>That thou dost purpose learnedly to fling</L>
<L>A rare Oration to the Persian King.</L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>
Then let the idle world prate this, and that,</L>
<L>The Persian King will giue thee (God knowes what▪)</L>
<L>And furthermore to me it wondrous strange is,</L>
<L>How thou dost meane to see the Riuer <HI>Ganges,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With</HI> Tigris, Euphrates, <HI>and</HI> Nimrods Babell,</L>
<L>And the vnhappy place where <HI>Caine</HI> slew <HI>Abell.</HI></L>
<L>That if thou were in Hebrew circumsised,</L>
<L>The <HI>Rabbyes</HI> all were wondrous ill aduised:</L>
<L>Nay more, they were all Coxecombes, all starke mad</L>
<L>To thinke thou wert of any Tribe but <HI>Gad.</HI></L>
<L>Sure, in thy youth thou eat'st much running fare,</L>
<L>As Trotters, Neates-feete, and the swift-foot Hare,</L>
<L>And so by inspiration fed, it bred</L>
<L>Two going feet to beare one running head.</L>

<L>And till the last thou didst forget thy Father,</L>
<L>I know not why, but this conceit I gather,</L>
<L>That as men sitting at a feast to eat,</L>
<L>Begin with Beefe, Porke, Mutton, and such meate;</L>
<L>And when their stomacks are a little cloyd,</L>
<L>This first course then the voyder doth auoid:</L>
<L>The anger of their hunger being past,</L>
<L>The Pheasant and the Partridge comes at last.</L>
<L>This (I imagine) in thy mindedid fail,</L>
<L>To note thy Father last to close vp all.</L>
<L>First to thy Mother here thou dost commend,</L>
<L>And lastly to thy Father thou dost send:</L>
<L><PB REF="9"/>
She may command in thee a Filiall awe,</L>
<L>But he is but thy Father by the Law.</L>
<L>To heare of thee, mirth euery heart doth cheere,</L>
<L>But we should laugh out-right to haue thee heere.</L>
<L>For who is it that knowes thee, but would choose,</L>
<L>Farther to haue thy presence then thy newes.</L>
<L>Thou shewest how well thou setst thy wits to worke,</L>
<L>In tickling of a misbeleeuing <HI>Turke:</HI></L>
<L>He cal'd thee <HI>Giaur,</HI> but thou so well didst answer</L>
<L>(Being hot and fiery, like to crabbed <HI>Caneer)</HI></L>
<L>That if he had a Turke of ten pence bin,</L>

<L>His <HI>Alkaron,</HI> his <HI>Moskyes</HI> are whim-whams,</L>

And when thy talke with him thou didst giue ore,</L>

from which I wrote this letter is <HI>Agra,</HI> a City in the said <HI>Eastern India,</HI> which is the Metropolitan of the whole Dominion of the foresaid King <HI>Mogol,</HI> &amp; 10 daies iourny frō his Court at the said <HI>Azmere.</HI> Frō the same <HI>Azmere</HI> I departed the 12 day of <HI>Septem∣ber, An.</HI> 1616, after my abode there 12 moneths &amp; 60 daies; which though I confesse it were a too long time to remaine in one and the selfesame place, yet for two principall causes it was very requisite for me to remaine there some reasonable time: first to learne the languages of those Countries, through which I am to passe betwixt the bounds of the Te∣ritories of this Prince and Christendome, namely these three, the <HI>Persian, Turkish,</HI> and <HI>Arab:</HI> which I haue in some competent measure attained vnto by my labour and industry at the said Kings Court, matters as auaileable vnto me as mony in my purse, as being the cheifest or rather onely meane to get me mony if I should happen to be destitute, a matter very incidentall to a poore Footman Pil∣grim, as my selfe in these heathen and Mahometan Countries through which I trauell: Secondly, that by the helpe of one of those languages, I meane the <HI>Persian,</HI> I might both procure vnto my selfe accesse vnto the King, &amp; be able to expresse my mind vnto him about the matter for the which I should haue occasiō to discours with him. These were the reasōs that moued me so long to tarry at the <HI>Mogols</HI> court, during which time I abode in the house of the English Merchants my deare Countrimen, not
<PB REF="12"/>
spending one little peece of mony either for diet, washing, lodging▪ or any other thing. And as for the Persian tongue, which I studied very earnestly, I at∣tained to that reasonable skill, and that in a fewe moneths, that I made an Oration vnto the King before many of his Nobles in that language, and after I had ended the same, discoursed with his Ma∣iesty also in that tongue very readily &amp; familiarly; the coppy of which speech, though the tong it selfe wil seem to an Englishman very strange &amp; vncuth, as hauing no kind of affinity with any of our Chri∣stian languages, I haue for nouelty sake written out in this letter, together with the translation thereof in English, that you may shew it to some of my lerned friends of the Clergy, and also of the temporalty in <HI>Euil,</HI> and elswere, who belike, wil take some plea∣sure in reading so rare and vnusuall a tongue as this is.

The cause of my comming hither is for foure respects. First to see the blessed face of your Maiesty, whose wonderfull fame hath resounded ouer all <HI>Europe</HI> &amp; the Mahometan Countries. Whē I heard of the fame of your Maiesty, I hastened hi∣ther with speed and trauelled very cherefully to see your glorious Court. Secondly, to see your Maies∣ties Elephants, which kind of beasts I haue not seen in any other country. Thirdly, to see your famous Riuer <HI>Ganges,</HI> which is the Captaine of all the Ri∣euer of the world. The fourth is this, to intreat your Maiesty that you would vouchsafe to grant mee your gracious Passe that I may trauell into the Country of <HI>Tartaria</HI> to the Citty of <HI>Samarcand,</HI> to visit the blessed Sepulcher of the <HI>Lord of the Cor∣ners</HI> (this is a title that is giuen to <HI>Tamberlaine</HI> in this Country in that Persian language, and wheras they call him the <HI>Lord of the Corners,</HI> by that they meane that he was Lord of the corners of the world, that is, the highest and supreme Monarch of the Vni∣uerse): whose fame by reason of his warres and vic∣tories,
<PB REF="14"/>
is published ouer the whole world: perhaps he is not altogether so famous in his own Country of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> as in <HI>England.</HI> Moreouer, I haue a great desire to see the blessed Toombe of the <HI>Lord of the Corners</HI> for this cause; for that when I was at <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> I saw a notable old building in a pleasant garden neer the said City, where the Christian Em∣peror that was called <HI>Emanuell</HI> made a sumptuous great Banquet to the <HI>Lord of the Corners,</HI> after he had taken <HI>Sultan Batazet</HI> in a great battell that was fought neere the City of <HI>Bursia,</HI> where the <HI>Lord of the Corners</HI> bound <HI>Sultan Batazet</HI> in fetters of Gold, and put him in a cage of Iron. These 4 causes mo∣ued me to come out of my natiue Country thus farre, hauing trauelled a foote through <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> so farre haue I traced the world into this Country, that my pilgrimage hath accomplished three thousand miles, wherin I haue sustained much labour and toile, the like wherof no mortall man in this World did euer performe to see the blessed face of your Maiesty since the first day that you were inaugurated in your glorious Monarchall throne.</P>

<P>After I had ended my speech, I had some short discourse with him in the Persian tongue who a∣mongst other things told me, that concerning my trauell to the City of <HI>Samarcand,</HI> he was not able to doe me any good, because there was no great ami∣ty betwixt the Tartarian Princes and himselfe, so that his commendatory letters would doe me no

good. Also he added, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> did so deadly hate all Christians, that they would certainely kill them when they came into their Country. So that he earnestly diswaded me frō the iourny, if I loued my life and welfare; at last he concluded his dis∣course with me by a sum of mony that he threw downe from a windowe through which he looked out, into a sheete tied vp by the foure corners, and hanging very neer the ground a hundred peeces of siluer, each worth two shillings sterling, which coū∣teruailed ten pounds of our English mony: this busines I carried so secretly by the help of my Per∣sian, that neither our English Ambassador, nor any other of my Countrimen (sauing one speciall, pri∣uate, &amp; intrinsical friend) had the least inkling of it, till I had throughly accomplished my designe: for I well knew that our Ambassador▪ would haue stop∣ped and Barracadocd all my proceeding therein, if he might haue had any notice thereof, as indeed he signified vnto me after I had effected my proiect, aleaging this forsooth for his reason why he would haue hindered me, because it would redound some what to the dishonour of our Nation, that one of our Countrey should present himselfe in that beg∣garly and poore fashion to the King out of an insi∣nuating humor to craue mony of him, but I answe∣red our Ambassador in that stout &amp; resolute man∣ner after I had ended my busines, that he was con∣tented to cease nibling at me, neuer had I more need of mony in all my life then at that time: for in truth

I had but twenty shillings sterling left in my purse by reason of a mischance I had in one of the Turkes Cities called <HI>Emert</HI> in the country of <HI>Meso∣potamia,</HI> where a miscreant Turke stripped me of al∣most all my monies, according as I wrote vnto you in a very large letter the last yeer, which I sent from the Court of this mighty Monarch by one of my Countrimen that went home by Sea in an English shippe laden with the commodities of this <HI>India,</HI> which letter I hope came to your hands long since. After I had been with the King, I went to a certaine noble &amp; generous Christian of the Armeniā race, 2 daies iourny frō the <HI>Mogols</HI> court, to the end to ob∣serue certain remarkable matters in the same place, to whom by means of my Persian tongue I was so welcome that hee entertained me with very ciuill and courteous complement, and at my departure gaue mee very bountifully twenty peeces of such kind of mony as the King had done before, coūter∣uailing 40 shillings sterling. About ten daies after that, I departed frō <HI>Azmere</HI> the court of the Mogol Prince, to the end to begin my Pilgrimage after my long rest of fourteen moneths back againe into <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> at what time our Ambassador gaue mee a peece of Gold of this Kings Coine worth foure and twen∣ty shillings, which I will saue (if it be possible) till my ariuall in <HI>England:</HI> so that I haue receiued for beneuolences since I came into this country twenty markes sterling sauing two shillings eight pence, &amp; by the way vppon the confines of <HI>Persia</HI> alitle be∣fore

I came into this country three and thirty shil∣lings foure pence in Persian mony of my Lady <HI>Sherly:</HI> at this present I haue in the City of <HI>Agra</HI> where hence I wrote this letter, about twelue pounds sterling, which according to my maner of liuing vppon the way at two-pence sterling a day (for with that proportion I can liue pretty well, such is the cheapnes of all eatable things in <HI>Asia,</HI> drinkable things costing nothing, for seldome doe I drinke in my pilgrimage any other liquor then pure water) will mainetaine mee very competently three yeeres in my trauell with meate drinke and clothes. Of these gratuities which haue been giuen me willingly, would I send you some part as a de∣monstration of the filiall loue and affection which euery child bred in ciuility and humility ought to performe to his louing and good mother: but the distance of space betwixt this place and <HI>England,</HI> the hazard of mens liues in so long a ioureny, and al∣so the infidelity of many men, who though they liue to come home, are vnwilling to render an ac∣count of the things they haue receiued, doe not a little discourage me to send any precious token vn∣to you; but if I liue to come one day to <HI>Constanti∣nople</HI> againe (for thither doe I resolue to goe once more by the grace of Christ, and therehence to take my passage by land into Christendom ouer renou∣ned <HI>Greece)</HI> I wil make choice of some substantial &amp; faithfull Countriman, by whom I will send some prety token as an expression of my dutifull and o∣bedient

respect vnto you. I haue not had the opper∣tunity to see the King of <HI>Persia</HI> as yet since I came into this country, but I haue resolued to goe to him when I come next into his Territories, and to search him out wheresoeuer I can find him in his Kingdome; for seeing I can discourse with him in his Persian tongue, I doubt not but that going vn∣to him in the forme of a Pilgrime, he will not one∣ly entertaine me with good words, but also bestow some worthy reward vpon me beseeming his dig∣nity and person; for which cause I am prouided be∣fore hand with an excellent thing written in the Persian tongue that I meane to present vnto him: and thus I hope to get beneuolences of worthy per∣sons to maintaine me in a competent maner in my whole pilgrimage till I come into <HI>England,</HI> which I hold to be as laudable &amp; a more secure course then if I did continually carry store of mony about mee. In the letter which I wrote vnto you by an English ship the last yeere, I made relation vnto you both of my iourny from the once holy <HI>Hierusalem</HI> hither and of the state of this Kings Court, and the Cu∣stomes of this Country, therfore I hold it superflu∣ous to repeat the same things againe, but what the countryes are, that I meane to see betwixt this and Christendome, and how long time I will spend in each country, I am vnwilling to aduertise you of at this present, desiring rather to signify that vnto you after I haue performed my designe then before; howbeit in few words, I will tell you of certaine Ci∣ties

of great renown in former times, but now part∣ly ruined, that I resolue (by Gods help) to see in <HI>A∣sia,</HI> where I now am, namely ancient <HI>Babilon &amp; Nym∣rods</HI> Tower, some few miles from <HI>Niniue,</HI> &amp; in the same the Sepulcher of the Prophet <HI>Ionas,</HI> spacious &amp; goodly; <HI>Caire</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> heretofore <HI>Memphis,</HI> vpō the famous Riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI> where <HI>Moises, Aron,</HI> &amp; the children of <HI>Israel</HI> liued with king <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> whose ruined Palace is shewed there til this day, &amp; a world of other mouable things as memorable as any City of the whole world yeeldeth, sauing only <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> but in none of these or any other Cities of note do I determin to linger as I haue done in other places, as in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and <HI>Azmere,</HI> in this Easterne <HI>In∣dia,</HI> onely some few daies will I tarry in a principall city of fame, to obserue euery principal matter there and so be gone.

<HEAD>❧ <HI>The Copy of a speech that J</HI> made to a Mahometan in the Italian tongue.</HEAD>
<P>THe Coppy of a speech that I made extempo∣re in the <HI>Italian tongue</HI> to a Mahometan at a Citie called <HI>Moltan</HI> in the <HI>Easterne India,</HI> two daies iourny beyond the famous Riuer <HI>Indus,</HI> which I haue passed, against <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his accur∣sed Religion, vpon the occasiō of a discurtesie offe∣red vnto mee by the said Mahometan in calling me <HI>Gtaur,</HI> that is infidell, by reason that I was a Christi∣an: the reason why I spake to him in <HI>Italian,</HI> was be∣cause he vnderstood it, hauing been taken slaue for many yeeres since by certaine Florentines in a Gal∣ly wherein hee passed from <HI>Constantinople</HI> towards <HI>Alexandra,</HI> but being by them interrupted by the way, he was carried to a Citie called <HI>Ligorne</HI> in the Duke of <HI>Florences</HI> Dominions, where after two yeeres he had learned good <HI>Italian,</HI> but he was an Indian borne and brought vp in the Mahometan Religion. I pronounced the speech before an hun∣dred people, whereof none vnderstood it but him∣selfe, but hee afterward told the meaning of some part of it as far as he could remember it to some of the others also. If I had spoken thus much in <HI>Tur∣ky,</HI> or <HI>Persia</HI> against <HI>Mahomet</HI> they would haue rost∣ed me vpon a spitt; but in the <HI>Mogols</HI> Dominions a Christian may speake much more freely then hee can in any other Mahometan Country in the world. The speech was this as I afterward transla∣ted it into English.</P>
<Q><P><PB REF="19"/>
But I pray thee tell me thou <HI>Mahometan,</HI> dost thou in sadnes call me <HI>Giaur?</HI> that I doe quoth he, then (quoth I) in very sobersadnes I retort that shamefull word in thy throate, and tell thee plainly that I am a <HI>Musulman</HI> and thou art a <HI>Giaur:</HI> For by that <HI>Arab</HI> word <HI>Musulman</HI> thou dost vnder∣stand that which cannot be properly appli∣ed to a Mahometan but onely to a Christi∣an, so that I doe consequently inferre that there are two kindes of <HI>Muselmen,</HI> the one an <HI>Orthomusulmā,</HI> that is a true <HI>Musulman</HI> which is a Christian &amp; the other a <HI>Pseudo-musulman</HI> that is a false <HI>Musulman</HI> which is a <HI>Mahome∣tan.</HI> What, thy <HI>Mahomet</HI> was from whom thou dost deriue thy Religion, assure thy selfe I know better then any one of the <HI>Ma∣hometans</HI> amongst many millions: yea all the particular circumstances of his life and death, his Nation, his Parentage, his dri∣uing Camels through <HI>Egipt, iria,</HI> and <HI>Pa∣lestina,</HI> the marriage of his Mistris, by whose death he raised himselfe from a very base and contemtible estate to great honor and
<PB REF="19"/>
riches, his manner of cozening the sottish people of <HI>Arabia,</HI> partly by a tame Pigeon that did fly to his eare for meat, and partly by a tame Bull that hee fed by hand euery pay, with the rest of his actions both in peace and warre: I know aswell as if I had liued in his time, or had beene one of his neighbours in <HI>Mecca,</HI> the truth whereof if thou didst know aswell, I am perswaded thou wouldest spit in the face of thy <HI>Alca∣ron,</HI> and trample it vnder thy feete, and bury it vnder a Iaxe, a booke of that strange and weake matter, that I my selfe (as meanely as thou dost see me attired now) haue already written two better bookes (God be than∣ked) and will hereafter this, (by Gods gra∣tious permission) write another better and truer, yea I wold haue thee know (thou <HI>Ma∣hometan)</HI> that in that renouned Kingdome of <HI>England</HI> where I was borne, learning doth so flourish, that there are many thou∣sand boies of sixteene yeeres of age▪ that are able to make a more learned booke then thy <HI>Alcaron,</HI> neither was it (as thou and the
<PB REF="20"/>
rest of you Mahometans doe generally be∣leue) composed wholy by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> for hee was of so dull a wit, as he was not able to make it without the helpe of another, name∣ly a certaine <HI>Renegado Monke</HI> of <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI> called <HI>Sergis.</HI> So that his <HI>Alcoran</HI> was like an arrow drawne out of the quiuer of ano∣ther man. I perceiue thou dost wonder to see me so much inflamed with anger, but I would haue thee consider it is not without great cause I am so moued, for what greter indignity can there be offered to a Christian which is an <HI>Arthomusulman,</HI> thē to be called <HI>Giaur</HI> by a <HI>Giaur:</HI> for Christ (whose Religion I professe) is of that incomparable dignity, that as thy <HI>Mahomet</HI> is not worthy to bee named that yeere wherein my blessed Christ is, so neither is his <HI>Alcoron</HI> worthy to be named that yeere wherein the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This doe all Maho∣metans call our Gospell or the Hi∣story of our Saniour, written by the foure E∣vangelists.</NOTE><HI>Iuieel</HI> of my Christ is. I haue obserued among the Mahometans such a foolish forme of prai∣er euer since my departure from <HI>Spahan,</HI> (which I confesse was no nouelty vnto me, for that I had obserued the like before both
<PB REF="20"/>
in <HI>Constantinople</HI> and diuers other Turkish cities) that what with your vain repetions &amp; diuers other prophane fooleries contained therein▪ I am certaine your praiers doe euen stinke before God, and are of no more force then the cry of thy Camell when thou doest lade or vnlade him: But the praiers of Christians haue so preuailed with God, that in time of drought they haue obtained con∣uenient aboundance of raine, and in time of pestilence a suddaine cessation from the plague, such an effect of holy and feruent praier as neuer did the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Words that the Maho∣metans doe often repeat in their praiers.</NOTE><HI>Scofferalahs,</HI> or the <HI>Allamissel</HI> alow of any Mahometan produce: yet must wee, whose praiers like a sweete smelling sacrifice are acceptable to God, be esteemed <HI>Giaurs</HI> by those whose praiers are odious vnto his Diuine Maiestie: O times! O maners! Now as I haue told thee the dif∣ference betwixt the effect of our Christian &amp; your Mahometan praiers, so I pray thee obserue another difference betwixt you &amp; vs, that I will presently intimate vnto thee: thou by the obseruation of the Law of thy
<PB REF="21"/>
rediculous <HI>Alcaron</HI> dost hope for Paradice, wherein thy Master <HI>Mahomet</HI> hath promi∣sed Riuers of Rice, and to Virgins the im∣bracing of Angels vnder the shaddowe of spacious Trees, though in truth that Para∣dice be nothing else then a filthy quagmire so full of stincking dung-hils that a man cannot walke two spaces there but he shall stumble at a dung-hill and defile himselfe, but where this Paradice is, not one amongst a thousand of you knoweth, therefore I will tell thee, it standeth in a Country scituate betwixt Heauen and Earth called <HI>Ʋtopia,</HI> whereof there is mention in the third book of thy <HI>Alcaron</HI> and in the seuen and thirty <HI>A∣saria,</HI> but expressed with those misticall and obscure termes that is very difficult to vn∣derstand it, for this Vtopian Paradice <HI>I</HI> say as the reward of al your superstitious mum∣bling in your praiers, and the often ducking downe of your heads when you kisse the ground, with such a deuoute humilitie for∣sooth, doe you Mahometans hope in ano∣ther world: But wee Christians hope to liue
<PB REF="21"/>
with God and his blessed Angels for euer and euer in Heauen, as being a proper and pecullar inheritance purchased vnto vs by the precious blood of our Christ, yet must wee be reputed <HI>Giaurs</HI> by those that are <HI>Gi∣aurs?</HI> One thing more will tell thee (O thou Mahometan) and so I will conclude this te∣dious speech, whereunto thy discurtious calling of me <HI>Giaur</HI> hath inforced mee, and I prethee obserue this my conclusion.</P>
<P>Learning (which is the most precious Iew∣ell that man hath in this life, by which he at∣taineth to the knowledge of diuine and hu∣mane things) commeth to man either by re∣uelatiō which we otherwise cal inspiration, or by industry: Learning by reuelation I cal that which God doth infuse from aboue by his special grace, vnto those whō he will vse as the instruments of his glory, who with∣out labour or trauell doe aspire to a most eminent degree of knowledge. Learning by industry I call it that which a man doth pur∣chase to himselfe by continuall writing and reading, by practise and meditation: now by
<PB REF="22"/>
neither of these meanes haue the Mahome∣tans acquired any meane, much lesse any singular learning, for as <HI>Mahomet</HI> himselfe was a man of a very superficiall and meane learning, so neuer was there any one of his Disciples in any part of the world that was indued with any profound knowledge▪ but wee Christians by the one and the other meane, haue attained to the most exquisite science that can be incident to man: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I mean the blessed Apo∣stles of our Sauiour.</NOTE>some of our men that neuer were brought vp in Studies hauing been so expert in a generall learning (onely by Gods speciall illumina∣tion) as those haue spent forty yeeres in the practise thereof, and others by continuall practise of writing and reading, haue beene so excellent, that they became the very Lampes and Stars of the Countries where∣in they liued. These things being so, it can∣not possible come to passe that the omnipo∣tent God should deale so partially with mankind as to reueale his will to a people altogether misled in ignorance and blind∣nes as you Mahometans are, and conceale
<PB REF="22"/>
it from vs Christians that bestowe all our life time in the practise of diuine and hu∣mane disciplines, and in the ardent in∣uocation of Gods holy name with all since∣rity and purity of heart? Goe to then thou <HI>Pseu-domusulman,</HI> that is, thou false-beleeuer, since by thy iniurious imputation laid vp∣on mee, in that thou calledst mee <HI>Giaur,</HI> thou hast prouoked mee to speake thus. I pray thee let this mine answere be a war∣ning for thee not to scandalize mee in the like manner any more, for the Christian Religion which I professe, is so deare and tender vnto mee that neither thou nor any other Mahometan shal scotfree call me <HI>Gi∣aur,</HI> but that I will quit you with an answer muchto the wonder of those Mahometans▪</P></Q>
<P><PB REF="23"/>
I pray you Mother expect no more letters from me after this till my arriuall in Christendom, be∣cause I haue resolued to write no more while I am in the Mahometans Countries, thinking that it will be a farre greater comfort both to you and to all my friends whatsoeuer, to heare newes that I haue accomplished my trauelles in Mahometisme, then that I am comming vp and down, to and fro in the same, without any certainty of an issue therof; ther∣fore I pray haue patiēce for a time: about two yeers and a halfe hence I hope to finish these Mahometan trauelles, and then either from the Citie of <HI>Raguzi</HI> in <HI>Sclauonia</HI> which is a Christian Citie and the first we enter into Christendome, from those parts of <HI>Turky</HI> by Land nere vnto the same or, from famous <HI>Venice,</HI> I will very dutifully remember you againe with lines full of filiall piety and officious respect. I haue written two letters to my Vncle <HI>Williams</HI> since I came forth of <HI>England</HI> and no more, where∣of one from the <HI>Mogols</HI> Court the last yeere, iust at the same time that I wrote vnto you; and another now, which I sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ointly by the same Messenger that carried yours out of <HI>India</HI> by Sea. Once more I recommend you and all our hearty wel-willers &amp; friends to the gratious tuition of the <HI>Lord of Hosts;</HI> I pray you remember my duty to Master <HI>Hancoke</HI> that reuerend and Apostolicall good old man, and his wife, if they are yet liuing; to their Sonnes <HI>Tho∣mas</HI> and <HI>Iohn,</HI> and their Wiues.</P>
