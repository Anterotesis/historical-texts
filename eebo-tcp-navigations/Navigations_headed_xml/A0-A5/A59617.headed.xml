DISCOURSE
Touching
Tanger.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honour'd Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Remember at our parting, I made
you a promise to gratifie your
curiosity the best I could, with
an abstract of my judgment and
observations, touching his Majesty's
City and Port of <HI>Tanger:</HI> and had o∣bey'd
you long since, and had not my
Head been rather oppress'd than em∣ploy'd,
by the unexpected difficulties
of my toylsom charge; which to this
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
day render me so little Master of my
Resolutions, that the few Minutes I
borrow, like broken Slumbers, scarce
afford me leave to reflect seriously on
any other Subject. Be pleas'd there∣fore
to take this short account only,
as an earnest of what you may far∣ther
expect; when with more free∣dom
of thought I shall be enabled to
send you a Present of the same kind,
better worth your acceptance.</P>
<P><HI>Tanger,</HI> according to remotest ac∣counts,
I find to have been a Colony
of the <HI>Romans;</HI> which conquering
People did from thence lead their Ar∣mies,
by which they subdu'd all that
part of <HI>Africa.</HI> They call'd a great
Province by that name; and thought
it so well worth their labour, that
they Planted, Peopled, and Built it to
the Magnitude of the greatest Cities;
as we find by the Fragments of their
Structures, where ever we have oc∣casion
to break ground in the Fields;
and by the noble Aquaeducts; some
whereof to this day supply the Town
with Water, said to be the best in the
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
World. But by the declension of that
Monarchy, it shrunk by degrees to
the dimension it now bears.</P>
<P>It was here the <HI>Moors</HI> form'd, and
from hence prosecuted, their great de∣sign
of conquering <HI>Spain:</HI> the ad∣vantageous
Situation whereof, is
thought to have not only incouraged
those Infidels to the Attempt; but
lent them such aids, as mainly con∣duc'd
to their success.</P>
<P>At length, about the year 1474,
while the Princes of <HI>Barbary</HI> were at
War amongst themselves, this, with
other Towns upon the Coast, fell in∣to
the hands of the <HI>Portuguez,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon his Majesty's Marriage with
our present Queen, <HI>Tanger</HI> was given
in part of her Dowry: a Capitulati∣on
much oppos'd by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mi∣nisters,
and gave that Government so
much apprehension, that, upon his
Majesty's sending so great a Garrison
as he did upon our first possessing it,
(jealous what design there might be)
withdrew a great part of their Army
from the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Quarter'd them along the Coast of
<HI>Andaluzia,</HI> to have an Eye upon our
Motions: by which State contrivance
as is thought of the <HI>Portuguez,</HI> they
got the respite of one whole Campaign
from the Incursions of the <HI>Spaniard.</HI>
This I the rather mention to excite
our own value for <HI>Tanger,</HI> which bare∣ly
our possession of, gives other Prin∣ces
so much caution.</P>
<P>This sufficing for the Historical
part of <HI>Tanger,</HI> to the time of his Ma∣jesty's
possessing it. I will now pro∣ceed,
with the brevity of a Letter, to
treat upon the four following heads,
<HI>viz.</HI> Upon
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Service <HI>Tanger</HI> has alrea∣dy rendred the Crown.</ITEM>
<ITEM>What Service it may render it, if improv'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The mischief it may do us, if possess'd by any other Powerful Prince.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Some general Observations touching Trade.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/><HI>Tanger</HI> is, as I have observ'd, so ad∣vantageously
Situated, that it Surveys
the greatest Thorough-fare of Com∣merce
in the World; having in one
view almost the whole Sea compre∣hended
between the four Capes of
<HI>Travalgar, Gibraltar, Spartel,</HI> and <HI>Ceu∣ta;</HI>
those on the <HI>European,</HI> these on
the <HI>African</HI> shore: so that no Ship or
Vessel can pass in or out of the <HI>Medi∣terranean,</HI>
unobserv'd from thence.</P>
<P>It comes therefore to pass, by means
of this narrow Gap or Inlet, that Men
of War, Pirats and Corsairs of all Nati∣ons,
covet to Ply and Cruiz in and
about that Station, where they are
sure to speak with all Ships that pass.</P>
<P>Here it was, that a Squadron of the
<HI>Dutch</HI> on two several occasions, du∣ring
that War, lay in wait for our
<HI>New-found-land-Fleet,</HI> who had no re∣course
for safety but to <HI>Tanger,</HI> where
they were protected and secur'd, till
the danger was over: the greatest
part whereof had otherwise demon∣strably
fallen into the Enemy's hands.</P>
<P>It was on this Station that Sir <HI>Tho∣mas
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Allen,</HI> during the first <HI>Dutch</HI> War,
incounter'd their <HI>Smyrna</HI> Fleet; and
here, in the last War with <HI>Algier,</HI> a
whole Squadron of <HI>Turks</HI> fell into our
hands at once, and were all destroy'd:
and both then, &amp; since by Sir <HI>Iohn Nar∣brough,</HI>
there has been by a manifold
degree more mischief done to that E∣nemy
on this Station, than in all the
Ocean besides: and we have frequent
examples of single Ships being chased
into this Port for shelter.</P>
<P>To this Port, upon the breaking out
of the last <HI>Dutch</HI> War, was sent us ad∣vice
of a Squadron of their Merchant
Ships, that were bound from <HI>Malaga</HI>
homeward, but ill guarded, with an
exact account when they were to de∣part:
which Squadron we incoun∣ter'd;
and had the Affair been more
fortunately manag'd, they had all fal∣len
into our hands; though, as it was,
the greatest part were destroy'd and
taken.</P>
<P>To this Place, on divers occasions
both by Sea and Land, we have recei∣ved
notice from <HI>Salli,</HI> and other pla∣ces
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
on the Coast, of proper Seasons
whereby to Attack that Enemy, and
have often succeeded in our Attempts
upon those intimations: and I think
I may with good assurance aver, That
by the advantage of this Place, we
have destroy'd more of those Pirates,
than all Nations besides put together,
who have been industrious to their
power to prejudice them; especially
the <HI>French, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Portuguez.</HI></P>
<P>And yet, farther to shew you how
this Place has been already useful, let
it be remember'd, that during the
Plague in <HI>England,</HI> when it was penal
in the highest degree in <HI>Spain,</HI> to hold
the least Commerce with us; notwith∣standing
the hazard they ran, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> themselves came over by
stealth, and by degrees did here supply
their wants, without paying Cu∣stom
either here or there; this Place
being the general Magazine to all the
Coast along.</P>
<P>What quantities of <HI>French</HI> Commo∣dities
were lodg'd here, during their
War with <HI>Spain,</HI> and were by little
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
and little in <HI>Spanish</HI> Vessels fetch'd o∣ver,
and put on Board their Gallions
when they were ready to receive
them, without ever Landing them?</P>
<P>With what ease and expedition did
Sir <HI>Iohn Narbrough,</HI> the last year, Car∣reen
and Refit the Ships under his
Command within the Mole; where
we had neither Hulk, nor any sort of
Provision for that Service? When I
often heard him say, with great satis∣faction,
That he would undertake to
Refit a Squadron in half the time, and
with half the charge, that it could be
done any where else out of <HI>England:</HI>
and I think I do not give him more
than his due, if I presume to say, he
is as qualified for credit in that parti∣cular,
as any man whatever of his
Profession.</P>
<P>How many Merchants Ships in pe∣ril
by Distress of Weather have been
reliev'd and preserv'd by the assistance
they have receiv'd from hence?</P>
<P>I could also insist on the damages
done on the <HI>French</HI> from this Place,
during our War with them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="6"/>Nor have the advantages been small
arising from considerable quantities of
<HI>English</HI> Merchandise, Manufactures,
<HI>&amp;c,</HI> dispos'd of hence into <HI>Barbary;</HI>
but, having an eye to may promise of
writing you only a Letter, I shall in a
word, as to this first head, only say,
That <HI>Tanger</HI> may be justly reckon'd
to have gon far towards the recom∣pencing
to the Government, the
charge his Majesty has been at, in its
preservation and improvement. And
if while in its Infancy, when there
could be no just regulation of the
charge, nor the place fram'd and culti∣vated
fully up to the uses and ends of
the Government, we can demonstra∣bly
make such a Calculation; what
may be hop'd from it, when besides the
large retrenchment it has already ad∣mitted
in its charge to the King, we
shall be able to demonstrate so many
farther extraordinary Services it is ca∣pable
of rendring the Crown, as I doubt
not to prove in the following Secti∣on.</P>
<P>Which is to shew wherein, and to
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
what degree, <HI>Tanger</HI> is applicable to
the ends and uses of the Government.</P>
<P>I think I may challenge <UNCLEAR>mankind</UNCLEAR>
to point me out, in the whole Globe
of the Earth, a spot of ground so
improvable of the honour and inte∣rest
of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, as <HI>Tan∣ger.</HI></P>
<P>What is it has rendered <HI>England</HI> so
formidable, so rich, and so renown'd a
Kingdom; but the strength of our Na∣vyes,
and Universality of our Com∣merce?
For our Fleeces might grow
till they Rot, and our Mines remain
in the bowels of their Mother; and our
People rust into the Barbarity of their
Ancestors, and our Nation become a
prey to every aspiring Monarch; did
not this mighty <HI>Machin</HI> set all Heads,
and Hands a-work, quicken our un∣derstandings,
and polish our manners,
and from an object otherwise of pity,
or contempt, render us the greatest
Pattern in the World, of the power of
Industry, the Fountain of all the
Blessings we enjoy: And because there
are many various Wheels and Moti∣ons
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
therein, why should not <HI>Tanger</HI>
be esteem'd among the principal of
those movements, which keep this vast
Engin going?</P>
<P>First, in respect of <HI>Spain,</HI> in case of
a War with that People; he who
knows any thing, is not ignorant that
the dammages we sustain by such a
War, are more through the Embargo
of a free and open Commerce with
them, so useful and profitable to this
Nation, that it becomes a doubt,
whether it be not of more account
than one half of the Trade we have
with all <HI>Europe</HI> besides; I say, the mis∣chief
in such case will be more, by a
suspention of our Commerce, than a∣ny
great damage can arrive us by their
hostilities: If so, then I undertake
to say, That <HI>Tanger</HI> is able in a good
degree, if not totally, to answer this
great objection. For, by virtue of
our vicinity with <HI>Spain,</HI> especially the
five principal Ports of <HI>Sevil, Cadiz,</HI>
St. <HI>Lucar,</HI> Port St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, and <HI>Mala∣ga;</HI>
and by the convenience of a good
Harbor here, which by the success of
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
the Mole is now well nigh effected;
our Nation there, in case of a War, may
remove, and settle their Factories
here: Which, both for the safety of
their Persons as well as Estates, they
need not be invited to do; having to
my certain knowledge, sundry times
been upon the point of taking that
resolution like one man, by some jea∣lousies
they have had of mis-under∣standings
likely to ensue, betwixt us
and that People: And affairs being
once so settled, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them∣selves,
as their occasions press them,
will take care to be supply'd from
hence; as in the Instance I have gi∣ven
during the Plague of <HI>England.</HI> By
this means, our Estates run no hazard
of seizure or Confiscation. We shall
be able to put off our Commodities at
better rates; and the King of <HI>Spain</HI>
wholly depriv'd of his Customs: <HI>Tan∣ger</HI>
it self becomes a proportionable
gainer by the bargain, and his Ma∣jesties
Subjects rest under the protecti∣on
of their own Country Laws and
Government, and in the liberty of the
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>
exercise of their own Religion.</P>
<P>Thus, as on the one hand <HI>Tanger</HI>
renders a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> less burthen∣some
to us, by so preserving the Com∣merce
unbroken; so by its advantagi∣ous
Situation, and improvement to a
good Port, it would prove so great a
Thorn in their sides, by the incessant
hostilities we should commit upon
them, (for it is not two hours Sail
from <HI>Tanger</HI> to the Coast of <HI>Spain</HI>) the
hazard and obstruction of their <HI>West-India</HI>
Trade, the ruining their Com∣merce
one with another all along the
Coast of <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> which would cer∣tainly
ensue; and the sundry other
damages by the help of <HI>Tanger,</HI> too
long to ennumerate, or not at present
occuring to my observation: All this,
I say, put together, seems to me to
yield matter sufficient to furnish us
with the highest sentiments of estima∣tion
for <HI>Tanger,</HI> though no other con∣sideration
were put into the Scale. For
if this whole <HI>Theory,</HI> or <HI>Postulata</HI> be
true, (as a good deal is prov'd by mat∣ter
of Fact, and the rest not to be dis∣proved,
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>
but as time must try;) then I
may undertake to say, that the Nati∣on
seems by <HI>Tanger</HI> to have gain'd this
great point, which is, that if hereto∣fore
the reasons touching the impor∣tance
of preserving our Commerce
with <HI>Spain</HI> have for the most been
found superiour to the motives (though
great) which that People may, by their
affronts and injuries, have given his
Majesty of resentment; those Argu∣ments,
I say, are by means of <HI>Tanger</HI>
removed, and his Majesty in a better
state of demanding satisfaction, or do∣ing
himself right; or the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
hereby become conscious of the disad∣vantage,
deter'd from those provoca∣tions.
And that they are apprehensive
of the benefits thus accruing by our pos∣session
of <HI>Tanger,</HI> is every day visible
from the pains they take to discourage
its prosperity, by obstructing by all
ways possible our supplies of whatever
kind from thence; especially of mate∣rials
for carrying on the Mole, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Whereof they are in great fear: So
that, if positive arguments in our Fa∣vour
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>
were less cogent, the bare opini∣on
they have of the use may be made
of <HI>Tanger</HI> in their prejudice, ought to
beget in any reasonable man, who
loves, and has any regard to the ho∣nour
and welfare of his Country, pro∣portionable
wishes for its incourage∣ment.</P>
<P>But, leaving <HI>Spain,</HI> let us proceed
to observe what may be of remark
touching <HI>Tanger,</HI> with respect to
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Commerce with <HI>Spain,</HI>
and their Interest in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gal∣lions
and Flota, has been universally
concluded equivalent to half the Na∣tions
of <HI>Europe</HI> beside; and they have
more business in, and about this Stati∣on,
and frequent the <HI>Streights</HI> mouth
with more shipping of one sort or ano∣ther,
than any two Nations in <HI>Christ∣endom:</HI>
From whence our Ships riding
at Anchor, may weigh, or slip, and
speak with all that pass in or out. Now
what an awe will <HI>Tanger</HI> bear on such
a People; and what greater blessing
can a Maritime Nation, as <HI>England</HI> is,
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>
so justly jealous of their Honour and
Authority abroad, ask of God Almigh∣ty,
than to be possessors of a Place pro∣ductive
of so many eminent Services, a
place capable of yielding so many good
Offices to our selves, and Friends, and so
much annoyance to its most powerful
Enemy? This I mean, who in our
Age has succeeded so far in its de∣signs
of Rivaling us, in the darling
Priviledge and Prerogative of our Do∣minion
upon the Sea; and how far it be∣hoves
us to cherish the means that Pro∣vidence
affords, and Nature seems to
mark out for our improvment, towards
the attaining of so important an end,
let every honest <HI>Englishman</HI> Judge. And
from <HI>France,</HI> let us proceed to <HI>Hol∣land.</HI></P>
<P>During the first <HI>Dutch</HI> War, <HI>Tanger</HI>
was in its Infancy, the Mole of little
benefit, nor were the Ministers then
so much enlighten'd in its usefulness;
insomuch, that during that War, the
<HI>Hollander</HI> (especially towards the lat∣ter
end of the War) did with a small
Squadron on Ships, scour the whole
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>
<HI>Mediterranean:</HI> And what with that,
and the preferrence they then found
in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ports, they gain'd much
upon us in those parts. But in the last
War it was quite otherwise; for upon
the damage we did their <HI>Malaga</HI> Fleet,
from <HI>Tanger,</HI> as I have already observ∣ed,
and the care then taken to have
Ships upon that Station, it is observa∣ble
they scarce had any Trade within
the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> after, during the
War: For the <HI>Dutch</HI> are a frugal and
wise People; and when the charge of
their Convoys grow in any degree
burthensom, they chuse rather to su∣spend
their Trade, than prosecute it with
any extraordinary expence or hazard;
especially that of the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI></P>
<P>Now if <HI>Tanger</HI> can produce such ef∣fects
in our Favour, in case of a War with
<HI>Holland,</HI> as it has done, and may yet
do in a much greater degree; and if
it can be in the like manner of use to
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in case of a War betwixt
them and <HI>Spain,</HI> as it has been to <HI>France,</HI>
during that War; Then let us al∣low
it an additional share in our praise
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>
and estimation, and cherish it in pro∣portion
to these farther benefits: And
now for <HI>Algier.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Algier</HI> is a Den of sturdy Thieves,
form'd into a Body; by which, after
a Tumultuary sort, they Govern;
having the Grand Signior for their
Protector, who supplies them with Na∣tive
<HI>Turks</HI> for their Souldiery, which
is the greatest part of their Militia:
And they in acknowledgement, lend
him their Ships when his Af∣fairs
require it. They are grown a
rich and powerful People; and by a
long practice of Piracy become
good Seamen; and when prest by our
Men of War, as of late we have experi∣mented,
they fight and defend them∣selves
like brave men, inferiour I am
perswaded to no people whatever.
They have no Commerce, and so with∣out
any taste of the benefits of peace,
whence their life becomes a continual
practice of Robbery; and like Beasts
of the Desart, only forbear to worry,
where by fear, not honesty, they are
deter'd; and yet when hunger pin∣ches,
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>
and a good morsel lyes in their
way, they will venture hard for their
prey; as may appear by the occasions
given by them for this, and the last
Wars.</P>
<P>The <HI>Algierines,</HI> I say, having no
Merchant ships, nor any Trade of
their own with other Nations, know
nothing of the motives Christian Prin∣ces
generally have of War and Peace;
so that their Polity and Rule is, whom
and how they may Rob and Plunder,
with greatest impunity. Therefore
with some Nations they will have no
peace at all; because they can dispoil
them without hazard. With others,
(as our selves) they will sometimes li∣sten
to proposals of peace; but not as
long as they can re-imburse themselves
upon our Merchant-men, what they
suffer by our Men of War. Now 'tis
worth ones while to consider how
this Wild Beast may be tam'd, so per∣nicous
to the Trade of the Kingdom;
and how far <HI>Tanger</HI> may lend a helping
hand in the bringing it to pass.</P>
<P>I have already given you an account
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>
of the advantage we have of Situation,
and how improvable towards the ob∣taining
Dominion in and about these
Seas; and of the damage the ships of
<HI>Algier</HI> have already receiv'd on this
Station, by the help of <HI>Tanger.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Algerines,</HI> above all others, when
at peace with us, do infest these Seas;
this Station being seldom without
some or other of them, cruizing in sight
of the Port: Where they frequently
come to an Anchor, and Water, and
supply themselves with Necessaries, sell
their Prizes, and reap great benefits by
the Place.</P>
<P>They have it also in their Instructi∣ons
from the Government, to call here,
and observe how the Mole advances,
and the place thrives; and I have been
told by the Captains themselves, who
protest, that nothing gives them so
much dread, as the apprehension they
have of the use we may make of <HI>Tanger</HI>
against them. Insomuch, that when
the Gally arriv'd that was presented his
Majesty, the <HI>Algerines</HI> look'd upon
themselves as half undone; as the
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>
Captain of the <HI>Mary-gold,</HI> the last
<HI>Turks</HI> prize, who was taken off of <HI>Tan∣ger</HI>
this War, assur'd me. Our <HI>Gally</HI>
Frigats likewise gave them great awe,
as they still do; being a sort of Vessels
which by the help of <HI>Tanger,</HI> may be
much improv'd to their annoyance.
And if his Majesty would please farther
to order the building of Vessels of War
proper and peculiar to this Service and
these Seas, he would quickly see the
good effect it would produce, in bring∣ing
that People to know themselves:
For though some of our <HI>English</HI> Vessels
sail as well as the <HI>Algerines,</HI> when
clean; yet such are yet but a few, and
we must also sail a good deal better than
they to do our business upon them.
Nor is it less demonstrable to me than
a Problem in <HI>Geometry,</HI> (however it
may seem not so much our present
Subject) that we may build Ships that
shall in a manifold degree out-sail our
best Sailors: These Ships need but be
few, and of little charge, and should
be always kept in <UNCLEAR>these</UNCLEAR> Seas, both in
War and Peace. For'tis the occasion
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>
makes the Thief; and a Coast or Place
unguarded is neglected: What signifie
the strongest Walls unmann'd; or all
the advantages of Nature, if Industry
be wanting in their application?</P>
<P><HI>Tanger</HI> well manag'd, may be ren∣dred
the greatest scourge to the <HI>Al∣gierines</HI>
in the World: and may af∣ford
them the best effects of Friend∣ship.
For if in time of War we can
force them from this so beloved Sta∣tion,
and attack them or their Prizes
bound in or out; and in time of Peace
(which we cannot refuse them) they
can be admitted to make use of <HI>Tanger,</HI>
and the Port, as their occasions re∣quire;
they may perform their Voy∣ages
in half the time, and with half
the trouble of returning home, to re∣fit
and Victual. For these <HI>Foxes</HI> prey
remote from their holes: and for one
Prize they take in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI>
take ten in the wide Ocean. So that
in their return homewards, if they
can dispose of their purchase at better
rates here, than they can have there,
and can refit again cheaper; What
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>
should discourage their embracing the
advantage, which will be great to
them, and proportionably so to us,
by the sale of their Purchase amongst
us, &amp;c?</P>
<P>But, says an honest man, and a good
Christian, this would be a scandal to
Christendom. To which I reply, It
is not thought so by the most Christi∣an
King; nor must we think so, if we
consider them a Government, quali∣fied
to Treat with Christian Princes,
as we do: for do not we enter into
Articles of Peace with them, which
are formally agreed to, and mutually
Ratified? If so, how can we refuse
them any thing, to which Friendship
may give them a Title?</P>
<P>Now, if what I have observ'd,
touching the Government of <HI>Algier,</HI>
bear any weight; then this must fol∣low,
that, upon conviction of the pre∣mises,
they will always esteem Peace
with <HI>England</HI> more Eligible than War,
and no temptation whatsoever (as
heretofore) can be believ'd will super∣sede
Arguments of so much force as
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>
those we have noted. If so, then up∣on
this single bottom, separate from
any the foregoing remarks, we may
build reason sufficient to fortifie my
Position, for the cherishing and in∣couraging
of this important Place by
all means possible. For if <HI>Tanger</HI> shall
appear so materially instrumental in
preserving a perpetual Peace with <HI>Al∣gier;</HI>
then hence alone the expense of
keeping it is abundantly defray'd to
the Government.</P>
<P>For the charge of one <HI>Algier</HI> War,
abstracted from the consideration of
the spoils they commit upon our Com∣merce
during such War; I say, the
Money expended for carrying on, and
supporting of one such a War, being
put into Bank, would at 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
produce more than the Annual charge
of maintaining the Place. If so, how
may we then reckon of <HI>Tanger,</HI> con∣sider'd
conjunctive of all the foregoing
Calculations of benefit that have been
produc'd in its favour? Then, as for
<HI>Salli;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Salli</HI> is a Government depending on
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>
the Emperour of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco.</HI>
They have but small Ships; the Bar
before the Port not affording depth
for Vessels of above 10 or 12 foot
draught of Water. All the Winter
they lie still. For after the <HI>South-west</HI>
winds have blown, there comes in so
great a swell of a Sea upon the Bar,
that it is not passable: So that this is
a Summer Enemy, and a very poor
one too, if we would be perswaded to
have an eye to them, as we ought. For
I'll undertake, with three or four small
Frigats, such as the <HI>Drake, Lark,</HI> &amp;c.
which on occasion of Neap Tides,
when they (I mean the <HI>Sally-men</HI>) have
not Water to go in and out, should
clean and re-victual at <HI>Tanger,</HI> and so
return upon that Station; those incon∣siderable
Rogues would by such care
be soon reduc'd to nothing: and yet,
when left to their liberty, they do a
great deal of mischief to small Mer∣chant-men.</P>
<P>The benefit arising by thus awing
those People (besides that to our small
Craft) will be, that it will in two or
<PB N="26" REF="15"/>
three year bring the greatest part of
Trade of <HI>Barbary</HI> to <HI>Tanger;</HI> as by rea∣son
of the Plague has been already
made good: For while the Infection
of those Countries kept people from
Trading thither, all, or the greatest
part of their Commerce, was by <HI>Tan∣ger:</HI>
and a War diligently manag'd by
those small Frigats, may produce the
same effect. Besides, it will teach
them to value our Friendship, and
help us to a better understanding with
them at <HI>Tanger,</HI> and in all likelihood
gain us a point of great advantage:
which is, to Treat and conclude a
Peace with them upon equal terms.
For, to buy a Peace (as hath been the
practice hitherto) is so mean and dis∣honourable,
and gives them so much
contempt for our Friendship, that it is
not to be supported.</P>
<P>Now if these ends are to be obtain'd,
(as I am truly convinc'd they may) it
will be wholly owing to <HI>Tanger.</HI> Which
having said, I proceed to my third
and last head.</P>
<P>If <HI>Tanger</HI> be a Jewel of so many ex∣traordinary
<PB N="27" REF="15"/>
virtues, and so peculiar
to the use and service of the <HI>English</HI>
Nation, 'twere a great deal of pity it
should adorn any Prince's Crown, but
his who wears it: For, it is but invert∣ing
the Argument, and the Artillery is
travers'd upon our selves, and all these
Cordials become so many Corrosives.
For though the bare loss, or want of
these benefits, to a Nation of our Cir∣cumstances,
would be misfortune e∣nough;
yet, when out of this priva∣tion
of good (which is a consequential
damage) shall be propagated so many
more and greater positive Evils to us,
than its possession promises of service
(for such will be the consequence, if
<HI>Tanger</HI> (which God forbid) should
come into the possession of the <HI>French</HI>)
with what care and tenderness ought
the Government to cherish it, and la∣bour
to secure it and the Nation, a∣gainst
such a hazard? The Trade of
<HI>England</HI> into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> is e∣qual,
if not exceeding all other Nati∣ons
put together. Can any thing then
challenge a greater share in our esteem,
<PB N="28" REF="16"/>
than the means which insure this migh∣ty
benefit to us? Shall Princes War one
upon another for the sake of a paltry
Town, upon the pass of a simple Ri∣ver;
and shall not we think it worth
our while to preserve a Place of this im∣portance:
so productive of good on
the one hand, or evil on the other? A
place so improveable of the ambitious
purposes of the <HI>French,</HI> that were it in
their hands, it would wound us in so
many tender places, that as we should
be always groaning under the weight,
so we should never wipe off the Impu∣tation
such a loss would fasten upon
us. We are just now Alarm'd with the
news of <HI>Tanger's</HI> being to be sold to the
<HI>French.</HI> But we have a wise Prince,
learned beyond his Predecessors in the
interests and advantages of Navigation
and Commerce, and a great promoter
thereof: Nor is his Royal Highness,
who has signaliz'd himself so much, to
the Nations and his own glory, by his
singular applications to the like study,
so ill possess'd of the value of this Place,
to concur in any deliberations of that
<PB N="29" REF="16"/>
kind. So that I reckon this Rumor
but among the other Libels against the
Government.</P>
<P>How clamorous was our Nation upon
the disposing of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI>
though the charge of keeping it was
scarce supportable; and in case of a War
with that People hardlytenable? Though
the use of it was only in some degree
privative of benefit to an Enemy in case
of War, but of no positive profit to us in
time of Peace; and yet whensoever a
Privateer or two sailing out of that
Port, shal annoy us but never so little in
time of War, the complaint is renewed,
and that proceeding censur'd a fresh:
How would that Minister then be ab∣solved
with the People, who should
advise the parting with <HI>Tanger;</HI> where
our little finger would be more felt,
than our loyns here?</P>
<P>But I have heard grave men say,
<HI>Tanger</HI> is a great charge to the Nati∣on.
'Tis a charge, 'tis true; but I
shew what it has already done towards
the defraying it; and to what an a∣bundant
<PB N="30" REF="17"/>
degree it will hereafter come
to discount the expence. A first rate
Ship, in time of War, is as great a
charge to the King, as <HI>Tanger</HI> is: And
yet, did ever any body complain that
our Ships were a burthen, or our
Fleets too numerous, when there was
occasion for their Service? Does not
<HI>Tanger</HI> live principally upon the
growth and product of <HI>England;</HI> and
the money, for the most part, circu∣late
among our selves? Is the King's
Treasure mis-employ'd there? Don't
we see every day the place improve;
the Mole in a good forwardness?
Which expence too will soon be at an
end. Are there not many useful pro∣visions
made, for the encourageing of
Shipping and Commerce? And are we
not sensible of it, by the increase and
improvement thereof? For I remem∣ber
the time, when a Boat from
<HI>Spain</HI> would draw down half the
Town to the Water-side; whereas
now a Squadron of Ships scarce excites
that curiosity.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="17"/><HI>Legorn,</HI> now a famous Port, and
Scale of Trade, was in this Duke of
<HI>Florence</HI>'s Grandfather's time a poor
Fisher Town. Maturity is the Child
of Time; and though God Almighty
may blast the best form'd purposes;
yet nothing, humanly speaking, can
prevent our fruition of the great bene∣fits
I have enumerated, if we but ap∣ply
the means; which in a few words
are these.</P>
<P>To prosecute vigorously the works
of the Mole; which in two or three
years, may render it a noble and safe
Port.</P>
<P>To fortifie the Town to the Land∣ward;
Which work should go hand in
hand with the Mole; lest when it
shall appear worth a Conquest, our
weakness should betray us.</P>
<P>To have a Garrison consisting of
two thousand Foot, in two Regiments,
and three hundred Horse; to be well
and duly paid, and to be recruited
<PB N="32" REF="18"/>
once in three or four years, by draughts
out of the Guards: By which means
we should always have a strong, or∣derly,
and well-disciplin'd Souldiery;
and not vagabonds, and raw, misera∣ble,
shiftless wretches, such as rais'd
men for the most part prove; where∣of
scarce the one half survive their
seasoning.</P>
<P>The punctuality of relieving the
Garrison (as has been of late resolv'd)
will also keep them in heart, chear∣ful
in their Duty, and not put them
upon such desperate courses, as many
of them in melancholly drunk∣en
fits have taken, by running to the
<HI>Moors;</HI> where, to the scandal of our
Religion, they either turn <HI>Renegades,</HI>
or remain in perpetual slavery. The
health of the Garrison will also by
this practice be preserv'd; for the
Souldiers diet being salt meat, disposes
them in two or three years to invete∣rate
ill habits of body, Obstructions,
Scurvies, Fluxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereof by rea∣son
of returning to the same diet again,
<PB N="33" REF="18"/>
when a little mended by the care of
the Physician, they relapse; and no∣thing
but removing them to a better
can recover them.</P>
<P>By this course I say, <HI>Tanger</HI> would be
the desirablest place for a Souldier in
the World, where they neither feel
hunger, or cold, nor excess of heat;
the duty easie, unless now and then,
when the Garrison is thin of men:
Where an industrious man can never
want work, and is no where better re∣warded:
In brief, 'tis a place that, in∣stead
of a Sepulcher as some call it,
will by this method become a Nurse∣ry
of brave men; where, if they dye
in the Field, as some now and then do,
they have their reward in Heaven:
If they survive to see their Country;
they will be cherish'd and consider'd at
home, as men of honour and merit,
who have drawn their Swords, and
serv'd their King and Country, against
the Enemies of our Religion, and of
God himself.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="19"/>The use of Horse is of so great im∣portance,
to the safety and tranquility
of the Place, that I take it for granted
we shall never be free from the insults
of the <HI>Moors,</HI> till our Horse shall be
augmented to the aforesaid number.</P>
<P>The strength of all the Christian
Garrisons upon this Coast, principal∣ly
consists in Horse: Which example
alone might suffice for our instruction;
for we are but of yesterday; and their
practice the result of some Ages of ex∣perience,
which is the best guide.</P>
<P>This Town was once preserv'd, or
rather recover'd, by the bravery and
opportune Service of the Horse; for
the Castle being surpris'd in the Night
by the Enemies privately getting in o∣ver
a low and defective part of the
Wall, the Horse taking the Alarm in
the Town, mounted, and before they
could get possession of the draw-bridge,
got in, attack'd, and defeated them;
who had otherwise demonstrably re∣main'd
with Victory.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="19"/>I am bold also to say, and it is the
Opinion of others who were upon
the Place, that had our Horse, the
day the Earl of <HI>Tiviot</HI> was lost, per∣form'd
their Duty; that great Man,
and the <HI>major</HI> part of those with him,
had escap'd the Fatal slaughter.</P>
<P>With such a strength of Horse as
this I propose; we shall not be only
able to perform with ease what is yet
wanting for the fortifying and Se∣curing
the ground we have gain'd;
but deprive the Enemy of the profit
they make by the Tillage and Pasture
of the Country round about us: For
they will be necessitated either to keep
an Army constantly in the Field,
which we know they cannot; to lose
the benefit and fruits of one of the ser∣tilest
spots of Ground in the World:
or allot us such Conditions, as shall
render us in a safe, easie, and plenti∣ful
Estate; which I take assurance to
affirm we shall, in such case, easily
obtain.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="20"/>As the benefits we shall reap by
such a number of Horse, prudently
manag'd, will be very great; so the
hardships we shall suffer without them
will be insuperable: For the ground
about <HI>Tanger</HI> being uneven, broken,
and proper for Ambushes; our Foot
will never be able to do any thing
to the purpose, but in Conjunction
of a proportionable number of Horse,
to discover and clear the ground,
relieve and succour them when press'd,
and secure their retreat when out∣number'd
and forc'd to retire.</P>
<P>Our Fortifications also; relieving
our Forts, and many other eminent
Services, will be but very imperfect∣ly
perform'd without the assistance of
a good body of Horse.</P>
<P>The fruits of this care and charge
will be reap'd, in the benefits result∣ing
by the Trade and Commerce it will
beget and establish here; for upon
a secure prospect of safety to Goods
and Merchandise, both by Sea and
<PB N="37" REF="20"/>
Land, and exemption from publick
Charges and Duties, and a general con∣currence
of all circumstances of
ease and expedition in Importing and
Exporting of goods, will in time ren∣der
<HI>Tanger</HI> the general Magazine of all
the Merchandise from the <HI>Levant</HI> ap∣pointed
for the Trade of the <HI>Spanish
Indies,</HI> as it will of our <HI>Northern</HI> Com∣modities
of greatest value: For the ex∣orbitant,
or rather insupportable Du∣ties
upon Goods in <HI>Spain,</HI> puts all
People upon By-ways, and secret ha∣zardous
practices, in the Shipping and
disposing of their Commodities; and
while <HI>Tanger</HI> can yield so good incou∣ragement,
considered with the benefits
of its vicinity with <HI>Spain,</HI> all People
will covet to lodge their Estates there,
where the whole charge (besides their
being out of the reach of danger of
<HI>seizure</HI>) of Register Money, which is
our quarter <HI>per Cent.</HI> there Collected;
Commission; Porterage; Freight to
<HI>Cadiz,</HI> &amp;c will not amount to the
charge of half Freight, Guard-money,
<PB N="38" REF="21"/>
National Duties, and Ware-house room
for two Months.</P>
<P>But there occurs one great and dan∣gerous
impediment to the establishing
this benefit at <HI>Tanger;</HI> and that is the
disputes that may arise, betwixt the
<HI>English</HI> Consuls in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ports,
and such as shall so Transport Goods
from <HI>Tanger,</HI> upon which they may
expect a benefit: but this must be for∣bidden
by all means possible, by the
strictest significations of his Majesties
pleasure in that behalf to his respective
Consuls upon the Coast; for there
are so many inconveniencies accompa∣nying
such a permission, as would quite
destroy all hopes of success in this affair:
and indeed 'tis to be fear'd this very ob∣jection,
or rather imposition, has alrea∣dy
administred no small discourage∣ment.
But as the interest of private men
must submit and give place to publick
Utility; so in case it appear that this
proceeding shall in any considerable
degree affect the Consuls in the respe∣ctive
profits and emoluments of their
<PB N="39" REF="21"/>
Office, it may be recompenc'd to them
some other way: But I do humbly pro∣pose
it, as fundamental and irrevoca∣ble,
that no Consul whatsoever of the
<HI>English</HI> Nation, be permitted to exact
or demand a peny for any Goods ex∣ported
from <HI>Tanger,</HI> to any of the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Ports; but that a bare Certificate
from the Government there, of such
Goods Shipt either in <HI>English</HI> or For∣reign
Vessels, shall serve as an ample
acquitment, and intitle them to exem∣ption
from all scrutinies and demands
of the Consuls of any kind whatso∣ever.</P>
<P>It is also humbly propos'd, that all
Ships and Vessels of War, as shall by
appointment attend the Garrison and
Port of <HI>Tanger,</HI> may have special leave
and permission from the Lord High
Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> to receive on
Board, and Transport such Goods to
<HI>Cadiz,</HI> or any where in the Neighbor∣hood,
as the Merchants shall have oc∣casion
to imbark; but not unless such
Ship or Vessel be bound to such and
<PB N="40" REF="22"/>
such a Place for his Majesty's service:
By this means, Merchandise will go
safer and cheaper, obtain quicker dis∣patch;
and the Trader consequently
another good incouragement to prose∣cute
this way of Commerce.</P>
<P>It is farther humbly propos'd, that
all Convoys outward bound which
touch not at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> as the <HI>Turky</HI> Ships,
&amp;c. may have order to call at <HI>Tanger;</HI>
as also all such as are homeward bound:
which being once become an establish∣ed
practice; People, as well Foreign∣ers,
and others, will lodge their Mo∣ney
there, to be imbark'd for <HI>Turkey,</HI>
&amp;c. And from the <HI>Levant,</HI> Merchants
will load their Commodities design'd
for <HI>Cadiz,</HI> or the <HI>Spanish Indies,</HI> in
<HI>English</HI> Bottoms, to be deposited in
<HI>Tanger,</HI> from whence they may re∣quire
them as their affairs shall go∣vern:
By which means our Shipping
also will be much incourag'd. This I
urge not but with submission to the
sence of the <HI>Turky</HI> Company, who are
the fittest Judges how far such a pra∣ctice
<PB N="41" REF="22"/>
may Influence their Trade. And
thus much touching Trade in general,
with respect to <HI>Tanger.</HI></P>
<P>There is no Position, as I have ob∣serv'd,
that bears more of the evi∣dence
of a Demonstration, than that
of the reduceableness, and extirpation
(by the help of <HI>Tanger</HI>) of the Piracy
of <HI>Salli,</HI> and all the Coast of <HI>Barbary:</HI>
which, besides the main benefit of re∣lieving
the general Commerce, will
bring as a consequence the greatest
part of that Trade to <HI>Tanger.</HI> For
those small Frigats as shall be employ'd
against <HI>Salli,</HI> (with whom it is pre∣sum'd
we are never to have a Peace,
upon no Consideration whatsoever)
shall have it in their Instructions (as
the <HI>French</HI> proceeded during their
War with <HI>Tunis</HI>) to obstruct all Com∣merce
with that People, but by way
of <HI>Tanger;</HI> which may be done with∣out
any great offence, by compelling
such as they find Trading upon the
Coast to go to <HI>Tanger,</HI> there to unload,
<PB N="42" REF="23"/>
in order to the searching after Contra|
band Goods; where, if they are found
guilty, as most Traders thither are,
the forfeiture of their Goods, and the
trouble that in such case will be given
them, will be sure to deter them from
a second attempt: if they are inno∣cent,
the vexation of being carry'd
out of their way, their detention at
<HI>Tanger,</HI> the incident charge, expence
of time, hazard, and one incumbrance
or another, will incline them either
to forbear Trading with <HI>Barbary</HI> at all,
or by way of <HI>Tanger;</HI> where they will
not fail of incouragement; for by
thus obstructing the Trade of <HI>Salli,</HI>
the <HI>Moors</HI> pinch'd through the want
of our Commodities, will make their
next recourse to <HI>Tanger,</HI> where find∣ing
good reception and dispatch, the
Commodities of the Country which
were wont to be carry'd to <HI>Salli,</HI> ha∣ving
no vent there, will fail; and the
stream of Commerce of course be di∣verted
hither: and when once the road
is beaten, it will not be easily bro∣ken.
<PB N="43" REF="23"/>
This too, as it brings the <HI>Moors</HI>
to seek us, will consequently draw
such as were wont to Trade to <HI>Salli,</HI> to
<HI>Tanger.</HI></P>
<P>But it must be the care of the Gover∣ment
here, to discourage to the ut∣most
the residence of <HI>English</HI> Factories
any where upon the Coast, but at
<HI>Tanger:</HI> by which means mens per∣sons
and Estates are secure against the
insolence and Caprice of that Barbarous
People; who, upon trivial and un∣just
pretences, make seizure of all;
whereof we have recent Instances, the
effect whereof we yet feel, and we at
<HI>Tanger</HI> often become as it were Hosta∣ges,
and compell'd (neither to the
praise of our Honour, or Politicks) to
make such Concessions as are both
dangerous and scandalous, and all out
of a tenderness to a stubborn, opinio∣native
People, who like some Ani∣mals,
rather than make a step out of
their own way, will go over a
House.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="24"/>And here I may not omit to ob∣serve,
that, as generous a People as
we are, there are yet among us a sort
of Men of the most degenerate aban∣don'd
Principles, who continue that
sordid, or rather impious practice of
supplying these Infidels with Powder,
Guns, and all sorts of Warlike Stores,
even while we are in actual War with
them both by Sea and Land; against
not only the Law of Nations, but e∣ven
Humanity it self: which guilty,
scandalous, and unchristian proceed∣ing
I trust to see punish'd, as it de∣serves;
and if our Laws prove defe∣ctive,
in that particular, our Legislators
may be humbly mov'd to find <UNCLEAR>expe∣dients</UNCLEAR>
in this behalf.</P>
<P>The next useful consideration to∣wards
the improvement of the Place, is
to incourage, by all means possible, the
Magistracy and Civil Government;
and this will invite People of Sub∣stance
to settle and abide here: the
<PB N="45" REF="24"/>
reputation of our Justice and Probity,
will be a means of supplying us with
a greater number of able and honest
Citizens; and those will support the
honour of our Courts, and maintain
the dignity of a Corporation. This
is very essential to the establishment
of new beginners, as we are; and, of all
points, the hardest to compass.</P>
<P>In the next place, it is my humble
opinion, that his Majesty might be
prevail'd with to let Leases to the In∣habitants,
for such a term of years as
might incourage them to rebuild their
dwellings, which are much decay'd,
and will fall to the ground, unless
some such provision be made to pre∣vent
it: and this, in time, will also
much increase the Publick Revenue.</P>
<P>I do farthermore humbly observe, that
the want of a positive Decision, touch∣ing
the Freedom of the Port, has occasi∣on'd
much contention and inconveni∣ence
amongst us; and great hurt to
<PB N="46" REF="25"/>
the Place: For unless it be understood
to be a free Port, as <HI>Legorn, <UNCLEAR>Marsellea</UNCLEAR>,
&amp;c.</HI> which Places ought to be our
Rule and Example in that particular;
we shall be rather a Trap and a Snare
to People, than an incouragement and
protection. For many an honest Man's
misfortunes have reduc'd him to Po∣verty;
and when invited hither, by
a notion of that freedom and Liberty
which other Ports, bearing that Title,
yield to such as put themselves under
their Protection, in hopes of a peace∣able
application to the repairing their
broken Fortunes, they shall be here
vext and molested with Suits &amp; Impri∣sonments;
People will shun us, as an
infected Place: and that great benefit
which other Ports of this sort reap,
and is so essential to the growth and
prosperity of this, is forfeited. I
would not here be understood to make
<HI>Tanger</HI> a Den of Thieves, where <HI>Bara∣taria,</HI>
and other infamous practices of
ill men, should have incouragement;
but humbly propose only, that our
<PB N="47" REF="25"/>
Superiours would please to inform
themselves, wherein those Ports
which are call'd Free differ from o∣thers,
and what those exemptions
and Priviledges are which give them
that Name; and from thence form
and establish such a Constitution, as
may for ever put us out of pain: for
this Constructive, or rather equivo∣cal
Freedom, as I may call it, which
we have hitherto been under, can ne∣ver
turn the Place to account.</P>
<P>I might farther multiply instances,
wherein, in time, by the Wisdom and
Favour of Authority, and the care and
industry of the People, this Place may
be render'd productive of sundry pro∣fitable
improvements, touching Trade,
Manufactures, Fisheries of <HI>Tunny, An∣chovas,
&amp;c.</HI> which in the end would
support the Government: But I here
