<HEAD>To my Honored Friend <HI>E. H.</HI> Esq;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN an age, when books had better be burnt for Hereticks, than pre∣sume to appear with∣out the dull formality of an Epistle; such a notable de∣fect would present them in as rediculous a <HI>Querpo,</HI> as a Courtier without the pro∣perty of his Sword, though to both equally useless; therefore, least I should be taxed with too much ignor∣ance
<PB REF="3"/> or presumption, to you who are our petty Heroes particular friend, and the depositary of his greatest se∣crets. To you, who have been an eye witness of some of the most remark∣able inconveniences that his natural curiosity, restless disposition, Amours, Incli∣nation, and fiery nature have plung'd him in: finally to you, that by consequence can best discerne what fruits are of his own growth, from what he may have borrow∣ed from his neighbours Or∣chards, I dedicate these fol∣lowing sheets. I am sensible
<PB REF="3"/> that now I should proceed to the setting forth of your praises, and humbly suppli∣cate for your generous pro∣tection, but really I am so lit∣tle accustom'd to the flatter∣ing stile of a Dedication, that I know not what more to say, therefore would glad∣ly take the opportunity to end with the general con∣clusion of, Sir, your most humble servant, <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>But then, what would the Bookseller say? who yet does expect so much scribbling as must fill up some empty pages of the last sheet? why Faith to
<PB REF="4"/> please all parties (if it be possible) <HI>I</HI> will make bold to lay you aside, and speak a word or two to the Cur∣teous Reader, and that I hope will do the jobb.</P>
<P>In the first place, <HI>I</HI> will let him know, that he will find here such varieties of humours, as, I hope, will please him, provided he adds not a number amongst the peripatetick Cinicks. To such I must confess these things would prove eyesores, at least if not a <HI>Scanda∣lum Magnatum,</HI> but to the Gay, Ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and witty sort this may be useful while
<PB REF="4"/> they leave the knoty points of the more morose part of learning to be cleav'd in sun∣der with the Beetles of the sowr Philosophers under∣standing.</P>
<P>In the first part you will meet with such accidents as wild young Travellers are apt to fall into, and if you please, you may make good use of them; In the second you will be diverted with the extravagant conceits of a <HI>Rosycrucians</HI> chymereal Philosophy, and sublime learning in the obstruce Sciences. In the third your imagination will be tickled
<PB REF="5"/> (especially if ever you have put your nose in a chymical Author) with some quaint expositions of the most dis∣ficult points, on all things such as the envious malice or con∣ceited ignorance of some Writers have left to posteri∣ty, wrapp'd up in those mi∣sterious riddles, that most wonderfully do puzle this age, and will fit the next for New <HI>Bedlame.</HI> But <HI>I</HI> advise you not to pin your Faith on all I say, for it may not in every point prove to be Madam truth in its <HI>puris naturalibus.</HI> And why you should expect to find more
<PB REF="5"/> reality in a Romantick story then in the Alchymists re∣ligiously grave Vollumes, <HI>I</HI> know not, except, <HI>Ridendo dicere verum,</HI> come in your mind, and delude you into the fooles Paradice. Well take your chance friend, while I inform you, that in the fourth part you will meet with the fruits and results of rash youth, when once it makes its own sword a Law, and every indifferent object the sub∣ject of his affections.</P>
<P>Now Curteous Reader, but that I think you wiser than my self, I would ad∣vise
<PB REF="6"/> you to follow what is good in the whole, (If you can find any) and so to take warning by others harms, as to go to bed in a whole skin, and the next morn∣ing sing to the tune of some new Ballad.</P>

<HEAD>THE English Monsieur <HI>A Comical Novel.</HI> The First Part.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Chief City of <HI>England</HI> there dwelt a married Cou∣ple, who, though they had nor such Fortune as to raise them to the first Rank. They enjoy'd a sufficient Estate to maintain themselves in a handsome mediocrity above the Vulgar.</P>
<P>One only Child had been the re∣sult of their twenty years Love, on whom they had bestowed an Educa∣tion rather beyond their Rank then sutable to it. <HI>Noble</HI> was his Name,
<PB N="2" REF="8"/> he had not attained to his Nine∣teenth year, when his Parents were forced to part with their onely Joy, and all their hopes, by sending him beyond Sea, thereby to reclaim and wean him from some company very unfitting his Age and condition, with whom he had unhappily acquainted himself, but all other means having been endeavour'd in vain, there was none left but that, which had so well succeeded to the Father, when about his Sons years, that they hop∣ed for the same good success towards the Son.</P>
<P><HI>Noble</HI> was of an indifferent size, small timber'd not very strong, con∣sequently quick, active, of sanguine fair complexion, and of a Restless disposition; he had an inclination to travel, and being of a quick appre∣hension, and agreeable conversation, it rendred him acceptable to all com∣panies of either Sex, especially a∣mongst the Female, his natural con∣stitution inclining him to <HI>Venus</HI> her worship, to the neglect of <HI>Bacchus</HI> his service.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<P>He had gone through the Rudi∣ments of the Latine Tongue, attain∣ed to a perfection in the French, and received some instructions from Eminent Masters in Musick, the Ma∣thematicks, Drawing, Fencing and such like gentile Exercises, when he forced his Parents to this Resolution, so contrary to their designs, and so a∣greeable to his own Genius.</P>
<P>Our young Traveller, was fitted with all things necessary for his Voy∣age, and an assurance of a Compe∣tent yearly allowance, so long as they should hear of his civil Conversation, and the following of his exercises: The day of his departure, Letters of Recommendations were given him to divers persons of Note and Re∣pute in <HI>Paris,</HI> with a Bill of Ex∣change for a supply of monies, to set him in the French mode so soon as arrived. The tender Mother's tear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with her private Golden blessing ended the Adieus. The next morn∣ing, very early, up gets our Stripling, and directs his course towards <HI>Dover,</HI> where he met with a favourable pas∣sage
<PB N="4" REF="9"/> to <HI>Calis,</HI> there having joyn'd him∣self to the company of the Stage Coach (though on a stout Gelding) they set forward for <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The last day of their journey the Coach found it very difficult to pass o∣ver a certain small brook, which was overflown by a sudden fall of Rain, which made the Company resolve to take up in some place on this side <HI>Paris,</HI> rather than hazard the passage. They therefore desired our young Gal∣lant to ride before to a certain Vil∣lage, which they pointed at, and be∣speak a good Supper for the whole Company. <HI>Le Noble</HI> glad of any op∣portunity to oblige his fellow Travel∣lers, gives no Answer, but flacking the Reins of his Bridle, made with a good speed towards the place, lights at an Inn, where having taken care of his Beast, he bespeaks a handsome Sup∣per for seven or eight persons, which would assuredly be there within an hour at surthest. In an instant mine Host gives out the Orders unto all the Officers under him, and they Execute them with dilligence eve∣ry
<PB N="5" REF="9"/> one according to his Station.</P>
<P><HI>Noble,</HI> mean time having espy'd a young Maid, who was preparing of Candlos to light this new come Guest to his Chamber, and perceiving that she had a certain Ayr and Meen, which was more pleasing than in such ordinary persons is commonly found, began a discourse, whereby to try, whether her Wit was answerable to her pritty outside. He had but just found out by her quick, yet modest reparties, that she was something more than a Inn-Keepers Chamber∣maid, when she was call'd to her bu∣siness, which broke off the discourse, but it had been soon renewed again by our young Traveller, who would have found out some opportunity to have accosted her again, had not two Mendicant Friers diverted him from it by demanding his Charity, in a pritty kind of obliging Dialect: He having formerly heard that such per∣sons are very pleasing and agrocable Company, did design to divert him∣self with these two good Brothers till Supper time; and leave his other
<PB N="6" REF="10"/> Game till after Supper; with that he falls in discourse with them, and desires their Company till Supper time, that then they should not on∣ly have their share of it, but carry the residue along with them. For, good Reader, you are to know, that those kind of Mendicants never car∣ry money about them, it being con∣trary to the Rules of their Order to ask for, or receive any. The good Friers accepted <HI>Le Nobles</HI> kind offer, and after a Glass or two of Wine, began to be in their usual witty and modest Mirth; and then came out a multitude of very pleasant Stories: of which those persons are alwaies as well provided, as are our Coun∣try Fidlers with Songs, sutable to all humours and Companies, though ever accompanied with more modesty. This made the time pass merrily a∣way, and the Coach not seem so long in coming, though it had pass'd it's hour. While they were all on their jokes, in comes mine Host fuming and puffing, swearing by all the fiery Gods, that the meat was almost
<PB N="7" REF="10"/> spoil'd, and yet no News of the Com∣pany, while the Host was thus venting that heat, which he had contracted at the fire, in comes a Messenger, with notice, that the Coach, having found out a by way was gone directly to <HI>Pa∣ris;</HI> these news one would think, should have struck our Traveller in∣to a consternation, but nothing less appear'd in his looks; on the contra∣ry, having bid the Host to serve up Supper, he told the Friers that he was glad to have met with their good Company, which with that of his Host, would be sufficient to divert him from Reflecting on this cross ad∣venture, which concern'd him no fur∣ther, than the not meeting with some friends, that would expect him that night at <HI>Paris.</HI> But it matters not, continued he, I shall be there early in the morning, mean time Gentle∣men, the satisfaction I receive by your good Company, makes a suffi∣cient return for my stay here this night; this Complement ended, while the good Friers were making some excuses, up come the fore-runners of
<PB N="8" REF="11"/> the Feast, and according to the French dilligence, in a moment the Cloth was laid, the Dishes placed in order, the Wine set in Tubs of water to Cool, the Glasses wash'd, and in a word all in a decent readiness, no∣thing wanting to begin the onset, but the word of Command, which is usually express'd by a Benedicite. The Company had not been long set but news was brought up to the Host, that the Curate was below that would speak with him, at which the Host said, Sirs, this Curate of our Parish here, is the best Company of the World, he is for all humours and constitutions, will you be merry, no man hath better Stories, will you be serious, he is a Saint, would you play, he knows all Games and tricks, would you drink, that is his Ele∣ment. In short, Sir, he is for what any Company pleases, and I assure you, you will receive a singular sa∣tisfaction in his Company if you p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ease to admit him into yours. <HI>Le Noble</HI> needed no further inducement, he quickly gave order that he should be
<PB N="9" REF="11"/> brought up: the Curate was no sooner enter'd the Chamber, but he sets himself down, and having said, Gentlemen, you may think strange at my abrupt intrusion into your Company, without the least Complement, but you must know, that besides my natural anti∣pathy towards them, I find, that in the posture you all are, I should pre∣judice my self very much in delaying to carry on the work of the day, especi∣ally it being so near a conclusion, with that he fell on, every fift or sixt bit cal∣ling for Wine, which he would take most disdainfully from the Waiter, if no brimmer, and spoke not a word more till the Cloath was taken away. Du∣ring the Supper, the two good Friers re∣lated divers pritty pleasant Stories and all freely took their Cups. After Supper the Curate did highly recom∣pence his long silence, there was no talk but for him, which he made up so pleasantly with Songs and Ralle∣ries, that no time could be more pleasingly spent. Amongst the rest of his Stories, I shall give you here an account of his last, which he Usher'd
<PB N="10" REF="12"/> in with this preamble to the two good Friers (who were then filling their Bugdets with the residue of the Meat according to <HI>Le Noble</HI>'s order.) Brothers, said he, I see you are now providing for your March, and I think it is high time, least you find the Gates of your Covent shut against you, and so be obliged, not much a∣gainst your wills, to take up your nights Lodgings at some good neigh∣bouring house, to the good mans di∣sturbance, though peradventure with the good liking of the Wife, her Daughter, Maid, or all three, rather than disoblige any of them. But before you go, pray give me leave to relate what a pritty kind of Confessi∣on, one of your Order required from a pritty young, but very silly woman. I must confess, (answer'd one of the good Friers) that we were wondring that you had spared us so long, contrary to your usual Custome, but do your worst, we will give you a <HI>Rowland</HI> for your <HI>Oliver,</HI> and begin when you please. At these Menaces, have at you said the Curate, and thus he began his Story.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>The Curate<HI>'s</HI> Tale.</HEAD>
<P>A Certain Good man, who had lately married a young Wo∣man, against a good time was telling his Wife, that he design'd to go to Confession, and that he would have her to do the like, she excus'd her self by informing her Husband, that she having never yet been at Confession, did not know the manner of it, nor knew she to whom she should address her self, sweetheart, said the good man to his Wife, in the Monastery of the <HI>Car∣melites,</HI> there is a certain Religious man of my acquaintance, to whom I will recommend you, for my sake he will instruct you, and will shrive you very well, so giving his Wife the name of the Frier, he sends her to the Covent. The good woman got thither inquires after the Frier, and she is ordered to wait for him in the Church; not long after comes unto her the party, who inquires what she desired; to which with a Curtesie, she made An∣swer, that her Husband, such a one
<PB N="12" REF="13"/> had sent her to him to confession, knowing that he was a godly man, and she young and unexperienc'd in such matters. At this the Frier pricks up his ears, and within his heart thanks his good fate, for presenting him with so good a Fortune, with that he takes her to an obscure place of the Church, where he us'd to confess others, and there, he holding her by the hand, began his Interrogations, and through his diligent Care and good Instructions, he made the Innocent Creature answer very directly unto all his questions. The Frier by this time having found by the silliness of her own Answers, that she was much Fairer than Wife, he resolv'd to bear up close to her, continuing his dis∣course in this manner. My dear Child, hitherto you have answer'd very punctually to all my questions, and accordingly I shall absolve you, but there is yet remaining one thing in which you must be very just, or you will commit a very great Sacriledge. Therefore be sure to give me a very exact account of what I am going to
<PB N="13" REF="13"/> ask of you. The poor silly Creature having made answer with a yea, Sir, and a short Curtesie, he drawing her still more in the dark, so that they could be perceived! It is my kindness to you, said he, which makes me lead you so in the dark, that you may with more freedom answer to what I shall ask you, and with that holding her by the hand with one hand, and under the Chin with the other, dear Child, continued he, how often has your Husband lain with you? Be sure you Answer me justly, and hid nothing from me? At thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the silly young thing, answer'd with a great sigh, truly so often with∣in the compass of the half year they had been married, that it was im∣possible for her to know the number. At this Answer, the Frier seeming much surpriz'd, how said he, not know the number, how can the Church have the Tithe then? And how can you hope for an absolution so long as you withold the Church of its rights; I am very sorry, continued he, that you are in so dangerous a condition, and for the Love I bear you, and by reason
<PB N="14" REF="14"/> of your want of knowledge in such matters, I would gladly find out some way to redress this great error, thus went the Frier on still aggravating each Circumstance, which so affright∣ed the poor silly woman, that she fell trembling upon her knees at the Fri∣ers feet, and all in Tears and Sobs earnestly begg'd, that he would con∣trive some way to absolve her from this so hainous a sin, seeing that she had committed it out of meer ignorance, and that her Husband was very much to blame, that he had not given her timely notice of it; and humbly intreated him to take the Tithes himself, as much as he thought fit, and rather more than less, that she might be absolutely freed and absolved from that grievous sin. The good Frier did what he could to appease her, and having setled her mind a little by his comfortable say∣ings, he told her, that for the pre∣sent, he would be contented with some small part of the Tithes, but that he would take a longer time to com∣pute what was due in all, for as he
<PB N="15" REF="14"/> would not have the Church to lose any advantage, neither would he for the World wrong her good Husband of the worth of a pin, with that he takes her by the Arm and conveys her by a secret passage into his Chamber, where he took what part of the Tithe he pleas'd, which having done and kissing the young Woman, go, my Child, said he, and be chearful, I shall come sometimes at your house, to take the rest of the Tithes, but one thing more I must inform you of before you go, know that is a mortal sin for any one to reveal any the least part of Confession, therefore you must be sure not to declare, by any means soever, either to your Husband or any body esle, what has pass'd between you and me, for if you do, you will be damn'd for ever without redemption. To which the Penitent woman having answer'd, that she would be sure to keep silence, and desiring him once more to take a larger quantity of the remaining Tithes, least any evil should happen to her or her Husband, by detaining them any longer, he to
<PB N="16" REF="15"/> gratifie her, and put her out of all fears, did make a further deduction of the arrears, and so dismiss'd her the same way she had come in, with his blessing, sending her home to the good man her Husband, with an assurance that he would come to her house and take the rest of the Tithes, when ever she would give him notice of her Husbands absence. The Curate had proceeded so far, when one of the Friers with a great deal of im∣patiency did thus Interrupt his dis∣course.</P>
<P>I have had much patience to hear you speak all this while, though all that you have said is very true, and that the Story goes on a great way further, but that which makes me thus impatient at present is, that you should have the confidence to put up∣on any religious Order, that of which you your self are guilty, you being the very person that did this hor∣rid act, for which you were deserv∣edly punished by the Husband and afterwards turn'd out of that Bene∣fice, which you had then in a Church
<PB N="17" REF="15"/> in the City of <HI>Lyons,</HI> where this fil∣thy Sacriledge of yours was commited, I happened at that time to be there, and I remember you very well: How you came to be entertain'd Vicar in this place, I wonder at, but I assure you, that I will make a strict inquiry after it, and have you punished as you deserve, being so great a scandal to the whole Church.</P>
<P>The good Frier would have gone on, and perhaps his Zeal to Religi∣on, and his abomination of such Crimes would have occasion'd a Learned de∣clamation against such Sacrilegious persons, but that the Host willing to befriend the Curate (who was one of his constant guess) interrupted the good Frier, desiring him to forbear at present any further discourse on that subject.</P>
<P>The Curate at this was not mute, but in a Chaffing manner told the Company, that he would maintain all that he had said was of a <HI>Carmelite</HI> Frier, that he knew him very well, that he would immediately go fetch some Writings in which they all should
<PB N="18" REF="16"/> see the Name and Sirname of the persons concerned, and where and at what time this was done; so in a great fury he went down Stairs. Mean time, the good Frier having in∣treated <HI>Le Noble</HI> to give him but one quarter of an hours attention, that he might justifie his Order, and set the saddle on the right Horse, he thus con∣tinu'd the Story.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The continuance of the Curates Story.</HEAD>
<P>YOu have already heard the no∣torious Villanies of this wicked Curate from his own mouth, though he would gladly lay it upon some o∣ther, the crime appearing so hainous to himself; that he is ashamed to own it, I will begin where he left off, and that he is that very person, I shall prove to morrow by undeniable evi∣dences.</P>
<P>This abominable man, being im∣patient to pursue what he had so wickedly began, staid not long till he went to visit this abused young Woman, and his visits grew so fre∣quent,
<PB N="19" REF="16"/> that at last, the good Hus∣band having some kind of suspition of the business, did one day wait for this beastly man, and soon did in∣trap him ploughing with his Heifer. The Priest (for so he was then) finding himself discovered withdrew to his home as suddenly and secretly as he could possible. And the poor abused Husband having found by the Silly Answers, which his simple In∣nocent Wife made to his questions about the business, that she had been, through her great simplicity, most a∣bominably abused by this wicked fellows subtle and devillish practices; he was not angry with her, but having instructed and admonish∣ed her, he left her very sorrowful and pensive, and immediately went to complain to the Bishop, of the abuse done unto him in the person of his Wife. The Bishop, with much pati∣ence heard out the poor man's Com∣plaint, and seeming very angry, gave order that the Priest should immedi∣ately be sent for, which was accord∣ingly done, so soon as he was in
<PB N="20" REF="17"/> the Bishops presence; he asked him in a very angry and furious man∣ner, what tempted him to do so wick∣ed a thing, and after many threats and chidings, not giving him once leave to answer, he told him, that he would severely punish him for it, after these and many more big speeches having first dismiss'd all that were in the Room, but the Plantiff and the De∣linquent, he strictly did forbid him ever for any more seting his foot into the in∣jur'd man's house, nor ever to dare to speak to his Wife, or so much as look upon her, and for a further punish∣ment, he charg'd him upon pain of Excommunication, not to enter in∣to any Church during three whole dayes, and so dismiss'd them both. The Priest went home much discon∣tented that he should no longer have so easie an access, as he had formerly to the good man's Wife, but what troubled him worst of all was the fears, that the Husband had disabus'd his poor innocent Wife, and better inform'd her for the future, so that he should be put to new practices,
<PB N="21" REF="17"/> before he could reclaim her again. As concerning his exclusion from Church, it fitted so well his humour and inclinations, that he was the better pleas'd with it, because it gave him more leasure to retire and contrive new ways to once more Insnare that poor innocent soul.</P>
<P>The Husband on the other hand being not at all contented, with such a sort of satisfaction as he had re∣ceived from the Bishop, resolves to make his complaint to the Gover∣nour of the City, with that he im∣mediately goes to his appartment, and acquaints him with the whole Story, and most earnestly begg'd upon his knees, that he would do him such Justice, as were suitable to the offence he had received, since that he could not have it from the Bishop, who of Right was to have done it. The Go∣vernour, who was a person of as great irregrity and goodness, as he was punctual and severe in his Govern∣ment, told the poor fellow, that it was out of his power to do him Ju∣stice; but continued he, yet I would
<PB N="22" REF="18"/> not have such notorious villanies pass unpunished, therefore honest friend since thou canst not get any other redress from the Bishop then what thou hast mention'd unto me, which is so insignificant, and I knowing by very good informations, that both the Bishop and Priest are persons of lewd Lives and Conversation, I do advise thee that the next time thou find'st the Priest to attempt any thing upon thy Wife, thou gets some friends to assist thee, and having in trap'd him, Gudgle him to some purpose, but take care of killing him, or breaking any of his Limbs, and when thou hast done come to me, and declare before those persons, that I shall have there on purpose, the whole business both of the wrong done thee, the Bishops sentence against the offender, and thy reven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon him, and let me alone with the rest, I shall take care that no hurt shall come to thee thereby. The good man, having thank'd the Governour, goes his way home again with a firm resolution to have his full Revenge, and to that purpose
<PB N="23" REF="18"/> watches the Priest narrowly, and admonishes his Wife to do the like, which she gladly undertook, being highly incensed against him, now that her Husband had undeceived her. They both were not long before they had an opportunity presented them, for the Lascivous Priest think∣ing the time long till he were at his beastly Embraces again, though the three dayes Pennance were not yet fully expired, writ a passionate kind Letter to the young Woman, and had it privately convey'd to her by an Old woman, that us'd to be employ'd by him in such Embassies, who found an opportunity to deli∣ver it privately into the young Wo∣mans hands, who going into some other place, as if to Read it in pri∣vate, she gave it to her Husband, who having opened it found writ in it as follows.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter being read, the Husband, after a little pause, bid his Wife tell the Messenger that had brought it, that the Priest should not fail to come to her in the Orchard at midnight, where she long'd to see him and do justice to the Church, that she would leave the back door open, and that there they might be very secure from her Husbands Jealou∣sie, with this Answer away goes the Messenger back, who made the Priest overjoy'd with this most favourable Answer, applauding his own wit and
<PB N="26" REF="20"/> subtlety, and longed most impatient∣ly for the happy hour. In the mean∣time the Husband gets in readiness two of his neighbours with lusty Cudgels to entertain the Gallant with all, according to his deserts, at the ap∣pointed place.</P>
<P>The hour came: into the Orchard came the Priest likewise; where in liew of the good woman's kind re∣ception, he met with one somewhat more crabbed at the hands of the Hushand and his assistants. In short, they all three did so well handle their weapons, that in a short time they left the poor Lover not able to stir a Limb, which invited them to be so civil as to carry him between them at a little distance from the Orchard, where near a high way they left him.</P>
<P>In the morning, when people be∣gan to stir abroad, the half dead sin∣ner was found in this condition by some going that way, presently it was reported to the Bishop, and the noise of it spread all over the City. The Priest is taken up, laid on a Hears<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> covered, and in great solemnity, and
<PB N="27" REF="20"/> demonstration of sorrow carried about all the quarters of the City, with a procession of Priests following after, and the hard usage of him told to e∣very one that inquired into the mat∣ters, though not one word menti∣on'd of the cause thereof, all this be∣ing done by the Bishops order; you must know, to strike sorrow and com∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssion, and that the severe punish∣ment, which he intended to inflict up∣on the Deliquent, should be the less wondered at. The Governour hearing, that there was such a procession on foot, and not knowing the occasion, made some of his Servants inquire the reason of it, the business being reported to him, he takes cognizance of the matter, sends for the Crimi∣nal, and will have a business that caus'd so much disturbance in the City, to be discussed before him, and those Ma∣gistrates, as us'd to sit on criminal causes, to assist him in a matter of so strange a nature; the Criminal is brought before the bench, he con∣fesses the fact, and withal the reasons that did move him to do it; the accu∣sers
<PB N="28" REF="21"/> come to aggravate the Crime, the Bishop himself appears in the be∣half of the Church, represents the affront done to the Clergy, and the evil consequences of it. The Gover∣nour upon that, asks of the Crimi∣nal why he had not complained to the Bishop, if he had had any wrong done him by any of the Clergy, who doubt∣less would have done him Justice, and not offer to carve to himself as he pleas'd out of Justices store! To which, the poor man answers, that he had made his complaints to the Bishop, but had received so little satisfaction the first time, and the punishment was so insignificant to the Delin∣quent, that it had not deterr'd him from committing the same fault over again, very suddenly after, so that he was resolved to do himself Ju∣stice. The Governour inquires into the manner and nature of the punish∣ment, to know whether it was pro∣portion'd to the Crime, and being Certified, that what the Malefactor had told him of the Bishops sentence up∣on on the Priest was true, he stood up,
<PB N="29" REF="21"/> and pronounced this sentence with a loud voice; For as much as the Cri∣minal, that stands at the Bar before us, has confessed the Crime he is ac∣cused of, and that it is sufficiently proved by the injured persons own mouth, and the marks that remain yet upon the Body of the ill treated, which he has lately received from the said person; I hear declare and pro∣nounce, that the said Criminal, shall be suspended, and is hereby suspend∣ed, from going into any Tavern dur∣ing three whole dayes; and that in case the said Delinquent does offer to set his foot into any Tavern, what∣soever or wheresoever, during the said time, after the giving of this sentence, that then he shall be proceeded against, as shall be judged fit.</P>
<P>This Ironical, but just sentence; having produc'd much joy on the one side, and more spight and vexa∣tion on the other. The Bishop in the name of the Clergy, stood up, and said, that he would appeal of this affront done to the Church in his Person, to a Supreme Power, so
<PB N="30" REF="22"/> went his way, with the rest of the Crew.</P>
<P>He was after that as good as his word, and the Governour, (who did stick close to him and the Delinquent Priest) having exhibited those evi∣dences, which he had gathered a∣gainst them both, and the witnesses being heard, the Bishop was quiet∣ly laid aside, and the Priest degraded and turn'd out of his Benefice, all as privately as might be, that the less scandal should arise to the Church, by the wicked actions of such dan∣gerous men. Now, Sir, I have made an end of my Relation, which I will avouch to be true to a tittle.</P>
<P>At this <HI>Le Noble</HI> rising and return∣ing thanks to the two good Friers, for their good company and agreea∣ble conversation, he assured them, that he did believe all that the Frier had said, was very true, and that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as further convinced thereof, by the Cu∣rates absence, whose guilty Consci∣ence would not let him return. With that the Friers taking leave with many thanks, went their ways,
<PB N="31" REF="22"/> and <HI>Le Noble</HI> gets into his bed Cham∣ber, where having call'd for the Host in order to pay the reckoning, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might be the sooner gone in the morning. The house, discharged, he goes to make fast his door, but find∣ing neither Look nor Bolt to it, he did make a barricado against it, of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he could find in his Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣ber; and then he flings himself upon the bed in his Gloaths, with his Pistols, and his Sword by him, having left the Candle burning in the Chimney.</P>
<P>Some hours after, our Traveller being in a profound sleep, he was a∣wakened out of it with the great noise, that those things which he had set against the Door, upon the Table made in falling, he throws himself off of the Bed, betwixt asleep and awake, full of fears, and in so doing makes one of his Pistols fall on the ground behind him, which went off and presently he heard some body cry out murther, the fright which he was in before being so great, he presently fancied that the Pistol had been shot at him, this struck him
<PB N="32" REF="23"/> into such a terrour, that he fancied a thousand persons were at hand, with Swords and Pistols to murther him, which made him stand stock still, not daring almost to breath, much less to speak.</P>
<P>After some time, finding that all was quiet his door shut and no body near him, he began to move and ven∣ture to cry out, <HI>Qui va la,</HI> hearing no body answer him, he steps to∣wards the door, and makes up his Barricado again, then retiring towards the Bed sees a solded Paper lye at his feet, he takes it up and finds this writ in it.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>SIr, there is a design in this house a∣gainst your Life, go not in Bed but stand upon your guard all night, and keep your door well shut. But I will break their measures or lose my Life, so long at <HI>Susetta</HI> is your Champion you need not fear.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Le Noble,</HI> soon perceiv'd that it came from the Maid, he had been fooling with the Evening before, but
<PB N="33" REF="23"/> won∣der'd very much at the stile and cha∣racter, much better than might be expected from a common Servant, which made him think that she was something more, then what she ap∣pear'd to be, this brought into his mind, that during his Jesting with her, he had found her full of quick repartees, a good discourse, an obliging modest way, and quite of another ayr, than that of an Inn-keepers maid. This began to work upon his fancy wonderfully, and representing to him∣self her pritty shape, her black eyes and hairs, and her excellent Com∣plexion; if it did not produce Love in his heart, yet it created a great esteem for her in his mind, which was very apt to take fire, he spent the rest of the night, in musing up∣on on this Theam, so soon as break of day appear'd, he heard <HI>Susetta</HI> making towards his Chamber door, singing this Song.</P>
<Q><L>The Enemies gone, the Coast is clear.</L>
<L>'Tis time for <HI>Damon</HI> to appear.</L></Q>
<P>This delivered with a good voice, she knocks at the door, <HI>Le Noble</HI> know∣ing
<PB N="34" REF="24"/> who it was by her voice, presently opens to her, who then appearing to him a thousand times prittier, in that negligent morning dress she was in, that made an end of his liberty; his standing mute, gaping upon her, gave her time to speak thus, Good morrow to you, Sir, I fear you have not had much rest this night, but it is well you are come off at so cheap a rate, I hope, you will pardon the boldness that I take, to intrude thus in your Chamber this morning, when you know it is in orders to your further safety, I perceive that you have read that note, which I convey'd into your Chamber last night under the door, when you were fast? And making as if she would take it out of <HI>Le Noble</HI>'s hands; pray, Sir, continued she, tare that pitiful Seribling: pitiful Scrib∣ling, reply'd, <HI>Le Noble.</HI> it is a jewel, and for the pritty Scriblers sake I'le wear it here, with that he puts it into his bosome. Oh fie, Sir, said she then, do not defile your skin, with the touch of what a dirty Chamber maid has handled: That has made
<PB N="35" REF="24"/> it the more bright, reply'd, <HI>Le Noble,</HI> and that high esteem I have for it, proceeds from the luster, that that pritty Chamber-maid, as you call her, has communicated to it, by the sweet influence of her hand. Nay, Sir, if you begin to Complement, re∣ply'd <HI>Susetta,</HI> I must leave you, for besides that I know they must be all slatteries; which you speak of me, such poor Creatures as we are, know not how to answer them, therefore let me intreat you, Sir, to forbear, and give me leave to inform you of the occasion of my coming to you so early, with that <HI>Le Noble</HI> taking her by the hand and leading her to the bed side, where with much ado he oblig'd her to sie down by him, he told her, that he was very much ob∣lig'd to her, for her care of his sate∣ty, and destred her to relate him how she came by that knowledge: Sir, said she, not long after you had re∣tired into your Chamber, I going to the place where I lie, perceiv'd a light through a Chink which was in a back room below stairs; where ve∣ry
<PB N="36" REF="25"/> rarely any person enters. I think∣ing that every body was gone to Bed, it made me the more curious to know on what occasion it was there, I came as near as I could to that place through which I had seen the light, and there I spy'd my Ma∣ster and the Curate that was with you the last night; this still increas'd my curiosity, which made me lend an ear to their discourse, I could hear the Curate say, it is not that which troubles me, Damn the Frier? That which I fear, is to be arrested to morrow morning, and to have a Child la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to my charge, those are the causes of my troubles, which how to remove, I know not, but by removing my self. But how is that to be done, reply'd my Master: I have a way said the Curate, if you would but assist in it: To tell you the truth, reply'd my Master, I am in a worse condition then you are, and therefore let us lay our heads to∣gether, and assist one another as well as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can, for I have not above a day, or two's time to look about me,
<PB N="37" REF="25"/> the worst on't is, that I have no horse, I should not want money long, if I had a good one: is there not a good one in the stable, said the Curate? It is but ridding your self of his Master, and the beast is your own, for any part I'le make use of the best of those two Jades, that are in the o∣ther Stable, and take my fortune with you, at whatsoe're you please: you propose what is not amiss, reply'd my Master, but the way to do it, is the business, I'le go see whether the Coast in clear, and then we will contrive, with that taking up the Candle, that forc'd me to retire into my Cham∣ber, not daring to hearken any more, for fear I should lose my self and you also, for I concluded within my self, that it was of you they had spoken, seeing there was no other Horse in the Stable but yours; I presently writ that Note you found upon the floor, which I had convey'd there under your door, and did resolve to watch their motions narrowly that night, so that they should miss of an opportunity to do you mischief, about an hour af∣ter
<PB N="38" REF="26"/> I did steel down the stairs again in the dark, to gain a further know∣ledge of their proceedings, but the Counsel was broke up, and I per∣ceiv'd the Curate, with a long Knife, which we use in the Kitching, follow∣ing my Master, who carried the Can∣dle before him, this made me con∣clude, that they were coming to mur∣ther you, I was so se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d with fear, at this sight, that presently stealing up stairs again, I gave a great blow against you Chamber door, I as I came by it, thinking thereby to have a∣wakened you, with a design to have immediately run into my Chamber, and, have cry'd out Thieves and Mur∣ther so loud and so long, till I had rais'd the Neighbourhood; which I did believe would prevent them from proceeding any surther. But it fell out better than I expected, for the noise which those things made which had fallen down with my push against your door, and you having discharg∣ed your Pistols upon it, gave me a just occasion to cry out. These noises had their wish'd effects, for presently
<PB N="39" REF="26"/> after looking out of the Window, which answer'd into the yard, I did see both the Conspirators going to∣wards the Stable, which made me conclude that they had quite given o∣ver the attacking of you, to seize up∣on your Horse: but I saw them make towards the other Stable, where they were above an hour, I never took my eyes off the door till I saw them come out again, each having a Horse by the Bridle, which they hung upon the Pails of the yard, presently after my Master comes in, and as suddenly went out again with some Pistols and a Gun, he open'd the yard door, they both got on Horseback, the door was shut after them, and away they went. I went presently after to see if the Coast was clear, to be more certain of your safety by their absence. But dear Sir, continued <HI>Susetta,</HI> my fears for you are not quite over yet, it is very pro∣bable, that having been disappointed at home, they have taken Horse to execute their designs abroad, there∣fore let me beg of you Sir, not to go directly to <HI>Paris,</HI> but get to some other
<PB N="40" REF="27"/> place, whence you may have a guide to conduct you, to your journeys end. <HI>Le Noble,</HI> gave her a thousand, thanks for her care of him, telling her that if he was once on Horseback, he would not fear what they could do to him, and that he would not go a step out of his way for them, with this she renewed her intreaties and prayers to him, with so much earnestness and passion to disswade him from it, that he could not but perceive that she was more than ordinarily concerned for him, which made him promise to fol∣low her advice, and having told her that he was confident she was not what she appear'd to be, it being impossi∣ble to find so much generosity and goodness in a common breast, she with a kind of rallery, and a most tak∣ing gesture told him, that if he would continue in that opinion, and honour her so much as to keep her in his me∣mory; she would e're long (if he would give her leave) come to him at <HI>Paris</HI> and endeavour to confirm him in that good opinion, there being something in the business, which her modesty
<PB N="41" REF="27"/> would not give her leave to discover to so great a stranger as he was, with that <HI>Le Noble</HI> assured her that he should be the most ingrateful of mankind, should he not be sensible of her sin∣gular kindness to him in a more than ordinary manner, that those good Offices of hers, that she had done him, had for ever ingrafted her not only in his mind, but in his heart also, for proof whereof he most ear∣nestly desired, that she would come to him at <HI>Paris,</HI> where she should find a most kind reception, and that he would serve her with his Life and Fortune, that gratitude bound him to it, and that he could never do too much for his dear preserver, with that he gave her instructions how to find him, and having taken out of his pocket a Purse full of Gold, he de∣sired her to take what she pleas'd out of it, which she would by no means do, pleading that she had no occasion for it, that what she had done for him, was on another principle then interest, and that this his offers made her fear he had not such fair thoughts for her, as
<PB N="42" REF="28"/> she hoped and wished he might have. <HI>Le Noble</HI> seeing that he could not fa∣sten any money upon her, and bring the more perswaded of her gentillity by this generous refusal, he pul'd off a Diamond, which he had on his sing∣er and presented it to her, telling her by the acceptance or refusal of it, he would know whether she had as much esteem for his person, as she laid had compassion for his dangers: And with much ado he got it on her finger, and would not permit her to take it off again; she at last, being in a manner forced to comply with his resolution<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> told him, Sir, since it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your plea∣sure to have me accept of so great a present, be pleas'd to take notice that it is upon condition you will be assur'd of the high esteem I have for your person, and that you will be pleas'd to receive it again, when I have the honour to see you next. By this time it was full day, and <HI>Susetta</HI> being call'd for, she desired <HI>Le Noble</HI> to excuse the condition she was in, being obliged to go about her business, to take, all occasions of Suspitions off of her
<PB N="43" REF="28"/> and saying this, she pull'd the Ring, which <HI>Le Noble</HI> had given her, off of her finger, and laying it up safe in her bosome, this is the Cabinet in which I shall preserve your present, Sir, till I have the happiness of see∣ing you again, with that making a Courtesie, and an offer to be going, <HI>Le Noble</HI> stept to her and having kiss'd her, once more repcated his protestations of friendship, and so they parted: she about her business, and <HI>Le Noble</HI> to see his Horse drest and fed, no sooner was the Horse got in a readiness, but <HI>Le Noble</HI> having given some money a∣mongst the Servants, gets on Horse∣back, and having inquired which way he should get out of the Village, made his Horse carry him towards that place. He had a design to shun the Road from that place to <HI>Paris,</HI> but his fate would carry him into it against his resolution, so that of a sudden he found himself in a certain passage, which had been noted to him, for a very dangerous place.</P>
<P>It was too late to retire therefore he resolved to trust his fortune on the
<PB N="44" REF="29"/> heeles of his good horse, if he should be attacked; he had not Rid a furlongs length, upon this heat or plain, but that he espies two persons coming up towards him from the wood on his left hand, he presently concluded them, to be his two Enemies, as really they were, with that resolving to rely up∣on the goodness of his horse, yet tak∣ing a Pistol in his hand, he begins a handsome Gallop, which in a little time, and before those two could joyn him had brought him in sight of some horse men, that were coming towards him, this made him put forwards, and the two others to fall back <HI>Le Noble</HI> have∣ing met with the Company, they all stood still to admire his Horse, and one of them desiring him to stop he did so, turns back, and stands still they all ad∣mires his horse, askt if it was to be sold, to which he answers yes, if once he was in <HI>Paris</HI> with him, one desired to see him walk, another to see him him Trot, and another to see him Gal∣lop; <HI>Le Noble</HI> perceiving, that his two setters were taking a Compass to get before him, without being known
<PB N="45" REF="29"/> and seeing also that those he was with did whisper to one another, and did en∣deavour to come to his horses head, which he still prevented; at last he told them, that if they had a mind to see the horse Gallop they must Gallop also, with that he sets spurs to his horse, and in a moment he had left them at such a distance, behind him, (he continuing his speed to the very gates of <HI>Paris</HI>) so that he never set eyes on them more.</P>
<P>No sooner was our escaped Traveller got secure within the Walls of that Great City, but he looked about and inquired for one of the best Inns; there he lights and sets up his horse, sees him well-rub'd and Litter'd, hay given him, and then he asked for a bed for himself, and truly by this time, he wanted one, he calls for the Master of the Inn gives him his Pistolls in charge, Orders somebody to go to the Coach of <HI>Roan</HI> for his Port Mantel, and sends another messenger to the very other end of the Town to seek out the house of one of those persons to whom he was recommended, to deliver him a
<PB N="46" REF="30"/> Letter; having given those orders, he marches up to his Chamber, and hav∣ing told the Servants of the house, that he would not be awakened nor disturb'd till he call'd; To bed he goes, which no doubt he found very refresh∣ing after all his fatigues, watchings and fears, he soon fell asleep with∣out rocking, and took his fill of it. The first thoughts that came into his head, when he awakened again, was of his dear <HI>Susetta,</HI> he endeavoured to put them by: but it would not do, he was naturally of a Sanguine and amorous a Complexion, and that passion had alwayes an absolute Em∣pire over all the faculties of his soul, therefore he thought it was in vain for him to oppose against so great a Torrent; attendance being come, he makes inquiry after his Horse, which he hears is very well, next demands for his Valise, and then asks if the Letter was delivered, his Cloak-bag is brought to him from the Coach, and news that the Messenger, that was sent with the Letter, could not pos∣bly find out that house by the directi∣ons
<PB N="47" REF="30"/> that was upon it, this made him re∣solve to make a search after it himself, but thinking that by that time he had seen his Horse dress'd and fod, and himself dine, it would be too late in the day to begin this progress, he re∣solv'd to let it alone till the next morning, and so repose himself, the rest of that day.</P>
<P>The next morning up he gets be∣times, and dresses himself in the am∣plest manner he could, and so sets forth in quest of his Marchant, but to as little purpose, as the former Messenger, he had quite tired him∣self, and was endeavouring to return to his Inn, once more looking up∣on the Superscription of the Letter before he put it up: when there comes by him a person in a gentile habit, who looking also on the Let∣ter, <HI>A Monsieur, Monsieur La Perle?</HI> Sayes he aloud, Sir, I am very glad that it is my fortune to find you here, at such a time as I can serve you, in bringing you unto that Gentleman, my very good friend and old acquain∣tance, Sir, reply'd <HI>Le Noble,</HI> in the loss
<PB N="48" REF="31"/> I am at, at present, I shall make bold to accept of your kind offer, and return you many humble thanks, for you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> extroa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dinary Civillity, to a person so much a stranger to this part of the World as I am. Sir, no more Com∣plements, I beseech you, reply'd <HI>Le Noble</HI>'s new guide, the very name of that Gentleman would make me act a thousand times more for your ser∣vice: come, Sir, follow me, the way is something long, intricate, and dirty, but we shall overcome it; with that he faces about, goes a good round pace, and <HI>Le Noble</HI> follows close after, with a great fear of losing so good a fortune, before he had had the full benefit of it, his guide leads him through abun∣dance of intricate by ways and Alleye, at last they come into a certain blind narrow street; the guide pulls a Key out of his Pocket, opens the door sets <HI>Le No∣ble</HI> in formost, partly by Complement, partly by force, he bolts the door after him, and shoves him up stairs before him.</P>
<P>Being come into a little dining room, he makes his Complement to <HI>Le Noble,</HI> desires him to sit down,
<PB N="49" REF="31"/> while he went into the next room to speak to a friend, that he had but two words to say, and then he would wait on him to his Merchant, that was but close by, and so steps into the next room, and pulls the door after him: mean time <HI>Le Noble</HI> sets him down to rest himself, in expectation of his Guides return, at last his natural Im∣patiency makes him think the time long, and his restless humour obliges him to walk up and down the room, and to pry in every Corner, at last he hears a kind of noise, of quarrel and swearings, as if at some farther distance than the next room, and as he gave attention to it, of a sudden all was husht; this put some jealousies into his mind, which had made him steal privately out of the house, but that he thought that he had heard his guide lock the door upon them, so soon as they were come in, and this increased the more his fears, with that he steps to the Window, opens it and looks out, with an intention to have call'd some body in but that lookt into a back yard, where he could see no body.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="32"/>
<P>The longer he waited the more did his fears increase; he steps to that door in which his Guide was gone, when he left him, hearkens, peeps through the key-hole, but could not see nor hear any body, which made him attempt to open it, but he could not, all these things did highly perplex him; as he was feeling round the hangings, to find out some other coveyance for him to get out at, he felt a hollow space, he goes to the Corner of the room, takes up the hangings, and though the place was dark, he could perceive a white Cloath, as if it were upon a Table, he goes towards it, and in the dark, feels, as well as he could, what it should be, at last, laying his hand upon something like a face, very cold and clamy, he did withdraw himself from that place, and being come to the light found that his hands were all bloudy, at this, such a Terror and Horror siez'd so strongly upon his Spirits, that he was never able to give an account of what he did, im∣mediatly after that; but what he can remember nearest to that bloudy fight, was that he thinks he leapt down
<PB N="51" REF="32"/> stairs, yet was not certain, but when he came to himself again, he found himself at the bottome of the stairs upon the floor, and a man over him, and the street door a little open, and one of his legs between the door and the door case; being come to himself a∣gain, and seeing the condition he was in, he Cry'd out Murder, at which some passing by stopt, and in∣quired what was the matter, he that held him under answered presently, that it was nothing, but a young Rogue, he had catch'd stealing of some things, they, not staying so long as to hear <HI>Le Nobles</HI> complaints, only saying pay him Rogue, went their wayes. This made <HI>Le Noble,</HI> set open his Throat, the wider, and struggle for life, which had so good an effect, that the next that came by were stopped at these outcryes of Murder, and con∣cerned themselves in the business, not taking the mans excuses for currant, and perceiving by that Leg which was out of door, that it belong'd to an upparel, somewhat of another kind, then such Rogues, as he would make
<PB N="52" REF="33"/> <HI>Le Noble</HI> pass for, do commonly wear, they forced themselves in; no sooner he that was upon <HI>Le Noble</HI> perceived that they would come in by force, but he left his prey, and murmering, get up stairs, <HI>Le Noble</HI> got up, and seated on the lower step declared to the com∣pany, that did continually increase, what he had found in the Chamber, that there was doubtless some body murthered in the house, and begg'd that he might be conveyed any where out of that place, in safe custody till the house was searched, there was not found any person in it, but two dead bodies, in a Vault, joyning the Cellar, and a head, in that place that <HI>Le Noble</HI> had mentioned, but a more strickt search being made, even over that house and the neighbouring, there was found in a gutter belonging to a house, about the fourth from that the murtherer was in, a man that lay close behind a chimney, who was discover'd by the prim of his hat, which gave a shadow upon the house top; he was presently apprehended and brought were <HI>Le Nob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> was detained, who presently knew
<PB N="53" REF="33"/> him to be his false guide; as the Of∣ficers were moving in order to carry them to prison in comes <HI>Le Nobles</HI> Merchant, who had been sent for, so soon as <HI>Le Noble</HI> had given evidence of his innocency by divers Circum∣stances, he being a person well known and of authority, became <HI>Le Nobles</HI> Bail, with some persons present, that freely offered to joyn with him in <HI>Le Nobles</HI> delivery, so was he sat at liberty again, and the Murtherer carried to prison, where after he had been thrice apply∣ed to the Rack, the third time he com∣fessed much more than was already known, but could never be brought to discover any of his complices, upon which receiving sentence, he was the next day broke alive, and set upon a wheel twenty four hours in publick veiw for a Terror.</P>
<P>The Merchant having got <HI>Le Noble</HI> free, Invites him to his house, there to be, till he was recovered of his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uises, and that he could provide him∣self elsewhere of private lodgings; <HI>Le Noble</HI> accepts of his civility, but first they go together to <HI>Le Nobles</HI> Inn,
<PB N="54" REF="34"/> where having discharged the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kon∣ing, the Host told him that if he would sell his horse, he had a Chap∣man for it, <HI>Le Noble</HI> willing to part with his beast, the Gentleman was call'd, and in few words the bargain was made, and <HI>Le Noble,</HI> receiv'd a hundred Pistols for it, with that a Coach being call'd <HI>Le Nobles</HI> things were put into it, and his Merchant and he were carried to his house. <HI>Le Noble,</HI> after a weeks time thought it convenient not to incommode his host any longer but to retire in private lodg∣ings, having taken his leave of his Merchant, and returned him many thanks for his civilities away he goes to another part of the City, where he had taken lodgings.</P>
<P><HI>Le Noble,</HI> during the time that he was with the Merchant, had contracted a particular friendship with a young man, much of his years, the Son of an Advocate of <HI>Paris,</HI> he was a good comely black man somewhat of a stron∣ger make than <HI>Le Noble,</HI> and more addicted to the Bottle, than the Sheet.</P>
<P>One day <HI>Marcine</HI> came to aquaint
<PB N="55" REF="34"/> <HI>Le Noble,</HI> that his Father had ordered him to go the next morning a journey into the Country, about some business, which would keep him out three weeks, and that if he would go with him he should be glad of his company, <HI>Le Noble</HI> having that day busied his thoughts more than ordinarily upon the absence of his <HI>Susetta,</HI> which he began to think very long, this had made him out of humour and Melan∣cholly, which made him tell his Com∣panion that being very much disorder∣ed by their late debauches, he would make use of the advantage of his ab∣sence, to take some physick, so desired to be excused. <HI>Marcine</HI> gone, <HI>Le Noble</HI> locks himself up, in his Chamber that he might not be interrupted from giv∣ing his thoughts wholly up to his pret∣ty <HI>Susetta,</HI> sometime he would frame a design of going to seek after her in disguise, then the danger of being known taking him off of that, he would be for sending a messenger on purpuse, with a letter to her, these designs were followed with a thou∣sand more, which still undid one an∣other
<PB N="56" REF="35"/> thus revolving in his thoughts to no effect, and it being pretty for∣ward in the night he gets him to bed, where presently after he falls a sleep.</P>
<P>In the Morning news was brought him, that there was a Letter for him, he having opened his door and re∣ceived it, he presently found that it was subscrib'd with the Name of his Dear <HI>Susetta:</HI> The joy, which he re∣ceived at the pleasing sight of that Character, made him give it a thou∣sand kisses, before he had the Patience to read the letter, having spent some of his fires upon that part, he had Patience to read the rest, which he found as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<CLOSER><SIGNED>SƲSETTA.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter he read and cond over and over, as if he would have learn'd it by heart, at last thinking he under∣stood the full meaning of it, he makes a resolution to take that journey, and with that rises in order to sit him∣self of all things necessary, which done, the next day he gets on horse∣back, and sets forwards towards <HI>Nor∣mandy.</HI></P>
<P>His first dayes journy had nothing in it remarkable, but the next will afford us something worth taking notice of: it happened that in the evening, he took up his lodgings at an Inn, were three or four Coaches meeting that very day, the house was extream full, and he coming late, and every body having supped, he was fore'd to bespeak a Supper for him∣self: mean time, while his Supper was getting ready seeing amongst the rest
<PB N="58" REF="36"/> of these Companies that were not yet retired into their Chambers, a pritty brisk young Woman that was very frolick, he accosts her, and falls in∣to discourse with her, he found her of a very fine humour and pleasant converse which had made him pass an hours time very agreeable, had it not been interrupted sometime by an impor∣tant Husbands calls; which having not been regarded, though often re∣peated, the Husband came down some steps, and told his Wife, that if she did not come presently, he would come and fetch her; she regarding it not did continue her discourse with <HI>Le Noble,</HI> seeming as well pleased with his good Company and gaysome hu∣mour as he was with hers.</P>
<P>This set the goodman in such a fury, that he came hastily down in his night Cap and flippers, and taking his Wife by the Arm, he pull'd her off from her seat giving her such a swing as had like to have fling her on the flour, saying, is this a time o'th'night to be tattling with a youngster, so that, you cannot listen to your Hus∣band,
<PB N="59" REF="36"/> when he calls you? get you up to your Chamber, or I'le send you up with a witness, she recovering her self, told him, that she knew her own time without his advice, that if he had such mind to his bed, he might go if he pleas'd, for her part she had not, and that she would stay till she had a mind to it. Mean time it is very strange, continued she, that you can∣not forbear shewing your brutish hu∣mour in publick, especially in presence of a Gentleman so civil, and of so pleasing a conversation; upon this the Husband going to take her again, by the Arm, <HI>Le Noble</HI> offer'd to enter∣pose in a civil manner, desiring the Husband to forbear all harsh usage to∣wards a person, who doubtless, had no further intentions then to pass an hour or two in a chearful conversa∣tion. At which the angry Husband, did snappishly answer, who are you, pray? That thus undertake to teach me? When I want a Master, I shall send for you, mean time meddle with own business. Go and get you a beard before you undertake
<PB N="60" REF="37"/> to instruct a man of my years. Here his Wife interrupted him, intreating <HI>Le Noble</HI> to take no further notice of his impertinance, assuring him that if it were not that she would detain him no longer from his Supper, she would in spight of her Husbands ill humour, stay as long as she pleas'd; but that she did hope to recompence this lost time the next day, if it was her good fortune to travel the same way. With that she made him a Curtesie and retired, follow'd by her angry Husband, who did resolve to break their measures, telling them, that they did reckon without their Host, and that he would prevent their coming together again.</P>
<P><HI>Le Noble</HI> could not forbear laughing at this Jealous man's actions, though vex'd that he had so soon lost his pretty companion. Supper being ready he fell to it, with a resolution to have another bout with his Gentlewoman the next morning. Having supp'd he ask'd for a Chamber it was answer'd, that he might have one if he pleas'd, but that there was ne're a bed empty, the house being so full, that every bed had two in it,
<PB N="61" REF="37"/> except one Gentleman, that lay single, that if he pleas'd to accept of part of his bed, they would go desire the Gentleman to spare it him. It be∣ing late there was no remedy, so that <HI>Le Noble</HI> was forced to go to bed to that Gentleman, who did very civily receive him.</P>
<P>In the dead of the night there was a great out cry heard of fire, which made all the people of the house to rise to know what was the matter. <HI>Le Noble</HI> and his bed fellow amongst the rest, so did the troublesome Hus∣band, who lay in the next Room to them. The inquiry made, it was found to be some small harm, that an ill extinct Candle had done, which being perceiv'd by a person between sleep and awake, which made him apprehend it to be worse than it was, had cryed out fire; but that all was well again. This made every one to retire to bed again in the dark, as they had got out of them.</P>
<P><HI>Le Noble,</HI> not long after he was in bed, heard his bed fellow sigh and say, sure never poor woman was trou∣bled
<PB N="62" REF="38"/> with such a Husband as I am, at this <HI>Le Noble,</HI> considering where he was, did stretch forth his hand, that it might serve him in the dark instead of Eies, and feeling about, he laid it upon a head, which he imagin'd did belong to a woman, by the dress and sliding his hand a little lower, he found by a plump, round pair of breasts, that he was not deceived, with this he con∣cluded that this was his last nights com∣panion, which he had so fortunately met with by mistaking her Chamber for his; and hearing no body stirring, he concluded also that her Husband by a∣like mistake, might be got to his bed, This having enboldned <HI>Le Noble,</HI> he took the liberty to embrace his bed fellow, and to whisper in her ear, who he was, and how he had come thither, desiring her to make no noise, and after some little busle which she made at the first surprisal, he had time to tell her. Seeing in spight of her Jealous Husbands ill humour, it had pleas'd fortune to bring them in bed together, she was to conclude that the fates had decreed it so. The rather
<PB N="63" REF="38"/> too, because her Husband did give them so fair an opportunity, by his absence, though, he supposed, much against his will, that therefore she was not to refuse him, what his good fortune had so bountifully be∣stowed upon him, she made some slight resistance, and pleaded much the un∣justice of the action, to which <HI>Le Noble</HI> having made such answers as brought her to say, but Lord what would my Husband say should he know it, he found by that, that the fort was yielding, therefore, after some more few kind words and Caresses, he made use of this op∣portunity, to revenge himself upon the Wife, of the Husbands rude∣ness to him.</P>
<P>After some stay with her she would have had <HI>Le Noble</HI> gone, but he plead∣ed, he knew not whither he should go, thus naked as he was, for there was no question but her Husband having got to bed to his bedfellow, who he had doubtless taken for her, he was fast enough till morning; and that so soon as day should but ne'r
<PB N="64" REF="39"/> so little appear, he would leave her, though to his very great regret, with that they renewed their Caresses, so that they were very well satisfied with one anothers Company.</P>
<P>A little before break of day, as they had concluded it, between them, <HI>Le Noble</HI> having taken leave of his kind bedfellow, he goes out of the Cham∣ber leaving the door open after him to shift for himself till the door of his Chamber was opened, but passing by it, he could not forbear trying whe∣ther it was open or not, having lift∣ed the latch, the door yielded to him, he presently gets in, and makes some kind of noise on purpose, that it should he heard, but the first time falling of his expectation, he made such a noise, that our jealous man being awakened by it, who thought pre∣sently, that it was some body to rob him of the jewel his Wife, or to steal something else, with such like thoughts, he gets out of lied, and having cry'd, <HI>qui Va la:</HI> he presently makes towards the door, which find∣ing close shut, but neither lockt nor
<PB N="65" REF="39"/> bolted, he opens it, and steps into the passage to satisfie himself the better, mean time <HI>Le Noble</HI> gets from the Corher of the Chimney where he had retired, fastens the door within side, and presently gets to his own bed, the affrighted man having search'd up and down in the dark, and finding no body, he comes back to <HI>Le Nobles</HI> Chamber door, which find∣ing Shut, he thought he had mistaken it, and feeling out for another door finds that of his own Chamber, some∣what standing open, as <HI>Le Noble</HI> had left it, into which being got, he shuts it, and goes to bed, as well satisfied as if he had lain there all night.</P>
<P>Not long after day appear'd, and presently comes one up kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king at every Chamber door, to give notice that it was time to rise, instantly the Window Curtains began to be drawn in every Chamber, and a noise heard, which still encreased as passengers were rising and getting ready.</P>
<P>You may imagine that <HI>Le Noble</HI> was none of the last, for the hast he
<PB N="66" REF="40"/> had to bid his sweet fellow, good mor∣row, he gets himself ready, and goes out of his Chamber: our Jealous Hus∣band was the first that <HI>Le Noble</HI> met with in the passage, they bid one ano∣ther good morrow, <HI>Le Noble</HI> told him, that he hoped that he was not so angry with him as he seem'd to be the night before, the Husband (whose anger was over) answer'd him, that he begg'd his pardon, but that it was her cross humour, and obstinacy, that had set him so out of humour: <HI>Le Noble</HI> return'd him his Comple∣ment, and told him that for his part, he never us'd to carry such things long in his mind, for proof whereof he would desire him and his bed-fellow, to take part of a breakfast, with him and his bed-fellow, the good man, who was as covetous as Jealous, (those two passions commonly go∣ing together) return'd him ma∣ny thanks, and told him, that so soon as his Wife were ready, they would both wait on him in his Chamb∣er, and that he would go in, to awak∣en her, <HI>Le Noble</HI> desired him to for∣bear,
<PB N="67" REF="40"/> telling him it was yet early e∣nough, that it was the Coaches Cu∣stome, alwaies to call two hours for their Passengers before their Horses were ready, and that peradventure she had not slept well that night, he made answer, that to his knowledge, she had slept all night like a Town Top, and not so much as stirr'd, with that he retires into his Chamber, and <HI>Le No∣ble,</HI> goes down stairs into the Kitch∣ing, to be-speak a breakfast, so re∣turning to his Chamber again, he found his Chamber fellow rising, hav∣ing bid him good morrow, he return'd him thanks for his kindness, when he was destitute of a bed, after some more Complements of the same na∣ture, according to the French custome, what shall we have for breakfast, sayes the Gentleman. Sir, replyed <HI>Le Noble,</HI> I have just now t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken care for that, and I hope, you will please to accept of a bit with me, and those persons that lye in the next Room: After the thanks return'd, their discourse, while they were dressing, was up∣on the accident that had fallen out that
<PB N="68" REF="41"/> night by fire, which might have been of very evil consequence, near so ma∣ny stables, had it not been so happi∣ly prevented, with that they reflected on an hundred accidents that are apt to befal Travellers, not only in their Inns, but on the Rode also, to which was added the churlish and dogged humours of Coachmen, and they concluded, with the unreasonable∣ness of the Hosts in their reckon∣ing.</P>
<P>By this time they were ready, and <HI>Le Noble</HI> hearing the Gentlewomans voyce, after the French airy manner which he had naturally, <HI>Bonjour, Bon∣jour, Madamoiselle,</HI> sayes he aloud, what is it not breakfast time with you yet? I fear you have not had a good nights rest, continued he, you speak so faintly this morning, to which she answered, that she never had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more pleasant night, and such rest as she wish'd she might enjoy often; which she believ'd was caus'd partly by her sitting up late, and the satisfaction which she had last night in his agreeable con∣versation, for proof whereof, she was
<PB N="69" REF="41"/> almost dress'd, and ready to take a good share of that breakfast, which her Husband had inform'd her that he had invited them unto. By that, both the Companies being ready, they met in the passage, where they re∣new'd their discourse, in a pleasant way of raillery upon the last nights acci∣dent, and the disorder it would have set them all in, had it continued long∣er, every one giving his sense upon it, according to his fancy, with this a Servant comes up, to know where they would have the Cloath laid, they not agreeing in whose Chamber, they all went down into the Parler, where they found their breakfast waiting for them, presently they fell to it, and forks being wanting, the Gentlewoman de∣sired her Husband to fetch down hers and her Spoon, which she commonly carryed with her, when she Travell'd, which the Husband did accordingly, they had in that Interval, a little more leasure to contemplate one another, by day light, though amorous glances, had not been wanting between them, all the while before, some blushes, which
<PB N="70" REF="42"/> the remembrance of their nights conversation rais'd upon the La∣dies Cheeks, added much grace to her natural beauty, so that our Tra∣veller, was infinitely taken with it, presently the Husband returnes, and they fell to eat, with as good an ap∣petite as Travellers use to have: one of the questions, amongst their other discourse, was which way each per∣son did Travel, by the answers, <HI>Le No∣ble</HI> finding that he should soon be ob∣lig'd to part from his dear bed-fellow said, I am extreamly sorry, that I must part so soon from so good a bed-fellow, as I have had to night, to whom I must remain infinitely obliged for his kind reception of me in the bed, when I was destitute of one, all the hopes that I have to requite it, is by being in∣form'd where I might have the hap∣piness to kiss his hands hereafter; that, reply'd the Lady, is so small a kind∣ness, as I believe the Gentleman will hardly refuse; yea, Madam, reply'd the Gentleman, he may command me in things of greater consequence, he now giving me the advantage, in the hopes
<PB N="71" REF="42"/> of injoying hereafter, more of his gay humour, as <HI>Le Noble</HI> was going to reply, the Lady said in a merry accent, just so would I have answer'd, I'le assure you, Sir, onely with this addition, that though there were never so many beds empty, he should afford me the plea∣sure of his Company in bed with me, the good Husband, who all this while had laid about him, so that he could not spare time to speak one word, then said, you are very forward Wife; if you would have answer'd so, 'tis like that this Gentleman, would not be of your humour, except he were of your Sex also, and therefore you might have left out that Clause, though the Hus∣bands words had been meant of this Gentleman, yet <HI>Le Noble</HI> took upon him, to answer thus, since that by this small interview, we may have some knowledge of one another, we may hereafter prove very good bed-fellows, and recompence the time we lost this night, Sir, I could answer you again, though you did not address your dis∣course to me, but that I have a Hus∣band, of so strange a humour, that I
<PB N="72" REF="43"/> must not speak. Pray, speak your belly full, reply'd the Husband, I'le not hinder you, but why should you undertake to speak another persons conceptions? <HI>Le Noble,</HI> to break off their Jarring began a good health to the Company, and presently af∣ter the Coachman came in to tell them that he was ready: This made them all rise and prepare to be going, but <HI>Le Noble</HI> desirous to prolong the time so long as he could, gave the Coachman something in private, and bad him go drink a pot of Wine upon his score: This made him tractable for one half hour longer thou he o∣therwise would have been. Mean time the Husband and the Gentleman were gone to get their things in readi∣ness, which gave <HI>Le Noble</HI> some time to speak in private to his bed-fellow, Madam, said he, shall I not be made so happy, as to know where I may here∣after have the happiness to kiss your hands, and assure you of the conti∣nuation of my most humble services? Yes, Sir, reply'd the Lady, and to let you see, that I am as desirous of seeing you
<PB N="73" REF="43"/> where; pray Sir accept of these Tab∣lets, which will inform you at lea∣sure, with that she pulling a Table∣book from her pocket, at which there was fastened a Diamond Ring, she presented it to him in a most obliging manner; adding that she would guess at the esteem he had for her by his dilligence in rendering her a visit: <HI>Le Noble,</HI> was going to reply, when the Husband came in followed by a Servant that carried the baggage, this broke off their discourse, and the Gen∣tlewoman went to see whether her Husband had left any thing behind. The Coachmans bawling did presently bring her back again, and <HI>Le Noble</HI> waiting on her to the Coach, took leave of her, of her Husband, and of the other Gentleman also, leaving them going towards <HI>Paris,</HI> and he presently after, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aking horse for <HI>Gif∣fors.</HI></P>
<P>He had not patience to stay till ba∣ting time to look on the present which he had received from his kind bed∣fellow at parting, but as he was up∣on the Road he pulls the Tablets out
<PB N="74" REF="44"/> of his Pocket, in which he found in every lease nothing but <HI>Lauretta</HI> on it all over, except one leafe which had on one side this writ,</P>
<Q><L>When on these Tablets you my name do find,</L>
<L>Those favours you received, bear in your mind,</L>
<L>And let this Ring, when on your finger worne.</L>
<L>Bring in you thoughts, what lately you have sworn, <HI>To yours Lauretta.</HI></L></Q>
<P>And on the other side of the same leafe he found this writ.</P>
<P>If ever you think me worthy of a vi∣sit, come to the next door of the three <HI>Kings,</HI> in <HI>Mercers</HI> street at <HI>Lyons;</HI> where you will find me continually regreting the Long absence of my most dear bedfellow with all the sor∣row imaginable.</P>
<P>Having read this he wondred that so much should be pen'd in so little time, not knowing when she could have done it: Which he concluded must of necessity be that which she commonly us'd to employ every morn∣ing in her devotions; having unty'd the Ring, he put it on his finger, with
<PB N="75" REF="44"/> some thoughts to be further acquaint∣ed with the Lady after his return to <HI>Paris.</HI> And then his dear <HI>Susetta</HI> coming in his mind, that diverted him from any further thoughts of the Lady for the present.</P>
<P>The impatiency to be at his jour∣nies end made him hasten to his horse, on which being got he that day came to <HI>Giffors,</HI> where having found out the signe of the Golden <HI>Key,</HI> he ask∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ there after a certain Gentlewo∣man who had sent to him to meet her there. The Master of the Inn made answer, that there had been a Gentle∣man there, that had been gone from thence two dayes since, and had left a Letter to be delivered to a Gentle∣man that should come to inquire after a Woman, that by the Character the Gentleman had left, it could be none but him, and so gave <HI>Le Noble</HI> a Let∣ter, in which he found what followes,
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEar, Sir, a business of importance forcing me hence, at an hours warning, is the cause I have not waited here, till you came. But I hope you will

</LETTER></P>
<P>And casting his eye a little lower he found this postcript.</P>
<P><HI>I hope you know the Character so well as to be satisfied with one letter, for the whole name. Ask at the Inn for one</HI> Megerlain <HI>who shall be your Guide, make what hast you can, the business re∣quires it.</HI></P>
<P>He needed no more to hasten his departure, and having got the fellow ready, they set forwards.</P>
<P>They were not half a mile out of Town; when <HI>Le Nobles</HI> Guide met with one he knew, that was riding with all speed to the Town for a No∣tary to make his Masters Will, who was near death.</P>
<P>This Tale set the Guide into such a fit of Crying and sobbing, that <HI>Le Noble</HI> could not forbear asking him what the Devil he ayl'd? Ah! Sir re∣ply'd the fellow, he was the best
<PB N="77" REF="45"/> Master that ever whipt Shool-boy, or taught spelling: then howling a∣gain as if he were at an Irish fune∣ral, methinks I see him still, conti∣nued he, how he would call to me, <HI>Megerlain</HI> go fetch me three Eggs (Oh, he lov'd them dearly) hoyl them for my breakfast, and when I have done with, them, thou shalt have the remainder to make thee some scollards Eggs for thy dinner. But now he's gone, and I shall be no more call'd to look his head, Ah! that head, that head in which so many fine things were Cubbord up, well but he's gone, or at least just going. <HI>Le Noble</HI> weary of this fellows im∣pertinent passion, bid him hold his peace, that surely he was not dead yet, or that a Notary had not been sent for. Ah, Sir, reply'd the fellow, you are come too late; I fear, that it may well be said of you, after death the Physitian, my Master must be dead, or he would never have sent for a Notary, he lov'd his money too well, to my knowledge, to make his Will before he were certain that he were dead, especially when he knew
<PB N="78" REF="46"/> that so rare a Physitian as you was on the way to visit him, I am sure you had been welcome, you that are the charitable Doctor, who take no money of any body. Ah? He lov'd those kind of good persons, that would not be greedily Bawling after their Fees, were they Lawyers, Phy∣sitians, or of any profession, but he is gone, and the young Gentleman that I left with him, has sent for you in vain, well it is done, and when grim death as once said I'le have thee, 'tis in vain to cry, hold Coachman: for you know, Sir, needs must go that the Devil drives, as the Proverh sayes, and as another learned saying of his was; the Devil take the hin∣most, he is gone and we must follow after him. Thus running his divi∣sions so fast, that <HI>Le Noble</HI> had not time to put in a word, at last they came to the place, where <HI>Le Noble.</HI> was brought into a Chamber, in which presently after, a young Gentleman came, who having shut the door af∣ter him, running to <HI>Le Noble,</HI> and flinging himself about his neck. Take
<PB N="79" REF="46"/> your <HI>Susetta</HI> said he, Sir, by this you have deserv'd her: At this <HI>Le Noble</HI> steping back, so soon as as he was freed of the embraces, knew present∣ly that it was his dear <HI>Susetta,</HI> in mans apparel, with that renewing their embraces and carresses, after a pause, <HI>Susetta</HI> told him that he was presently to appear very grave, and act the part of a Physitian, that she had no time to give him further In∣structions at present, but desired him to follow her, where that he would be suddenly inform'd; with that they both went from that room to the sick mans Chamber, where there was no other light, but what a farthing watch Candle did afford, so that <HI>Le Noble</HI> was some time before he could make use of his eye sight. At last <HI>Susetta</HI> having brought <HI>Le Noble</HI> to the bedside, and convey'd his hand upon the sickmans arm, I pray, Sir, said she, feel his Pulse, and tell me what hopes I may have, and as you ever were my very good friend, be pleas'd to use the best of your skill, for the recovery of my dear Uncle, who I
<PB N="80" REF="47"/> assure you, I shall not long survive, if it is decreed he must now dye, with that she seem'd to weep most bitterly. The poor sick Creature, af∣ter he had clear'd his Throat of some troublesome Phlegm; which barrica∣do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d up his speech, spoke in a low voice as follows: my Dear heart, I charge thee by our Loves, and by that power, I should have had over thee, if it had pleas'd the Heavens to have let me live, that thou grieve not for me, I die contented now that I am assured of thy real affections, but I beg of thee, that thou wouldst live to enjoy all that I have, which I leave thee, I find it is too late, to wait for a Notary, therefore all you that are present here, take no∣tice, continued he, with a loud voice, that I give all that I have to this person my Nephew, unto whom I give these my Keys, and I here in the presence of you all, declare her my heir, with that he reached forth his arm to <HI>Susetta,</HI> and dropt a bunch of Keys into her hand, and there Pausing a while for a little breath,
<PB N="81" REF="47"/> they could hear some of those persons that were in the Chamber say, now for certain he is going, for he raves, and takes his kinsman for a woman, alass, poor man, peace be with his soul, a while after he thus began again, if there is any body in this house that can write, let them set down what I have said, and I will signe it, as well as I can, and let all those that have heard me, and that shall see me signe it, witness it with their hands; then after another little pause, <HI>Susetta,</HI> sayes he, give me thy hand, <HI>Susetta</HI> having laid her hand into his, when I am gone, remember me, and pray, whosoever writes my Will, let him make hast, for I have not long to stay I find: <HI>Susetta</HI> held her handker∣cheif before her eyes all this while, as if she wept, and forcing a sob from her breast, sigh not, nor grieve for me said the sick man; by this time <HI>Le Noble,</HI> who had taken upon him to write the will, had made an end, it was presently brought to the dying man with a pen and ink, who had no sooner set his hand to it, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t turning
<PB N="82" REF="48"/> on one side, cryed farewel <HI>Sus.</HI> and so gave up the Ghost, presently there was a whining cry in the room, which <HI>Le Noble</HI> did immediately in∣terrupt, by presenting to each of them the Will, to set their marks to, for there was not one could read nor write, but the Priest, who having of∣ficiated to the sick man in the morn∣ing was gone; presently after <HI>Le No∣ble</HI> and <HI>Susetta</HI> were forced to go into another room, to be out of the hide∣ous noise, that <HI>Magerlain</HI> was making for the Death of his Master: <HI>Susetta</HI> gave order for all things for his buri∣al, which was performed the next day, after which all the persons of the house, acknowledging her as a Ne∣phew and heir to the deceas'd, they apply'd themselves to her for their payments, and <HI>Susetta</HI> having that day discharged the house also she gave unto <HI>Megetlain</HI> all that was his Masters, which was of no great cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quence, and so dismiss'd him, reserving to her self one little Trunk in which she had locked up all the writings, the mony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat was left and some other things of
<PB N="83" REF="48"/> value which they caus'd to be con∣vey'd to the next Market Town to∣wards <HI>Paris,</HI> where they followed immediately after.</P>
<P>Here they began to breath, to con∣gratulate one another, and renew their Caresses, <HI>Le Noble</HI> saying to <HI>Susetta</HI> that by his diligence he had made to obey her at the first summons he hoped she was convinced of his af∣fections to her, and assured her, that all he had protested was real, of which he would give her further proofs, when ever she should desire it, my dear <HI>Le Noble,</HI> reply'd <HI>Susetta,</HI> I am so well satisfied in all respects, that I give my self wholly up to you, to do what you please with me, one thing I shall only desire of you; <HI>Le Noble,</HI> having asked her what it was, she made answer, that she beg'd of him, that he would continue his love to her, and not forsake her. Nay, if you begin to Article once, reply'd <HI>Le Noble</HI> merrily, let me make one also, and that shall be, that as you desire I should alwayes continue in my af∣fections to you, which I grant you, you
<PB N="84" REF="49"/> should never talk of that formal thing call'd Marriage, which you must grant me; tis done, answer'd <HI>Susetta,</HI> and add to this continued she, that all our goods shall be in common; done said <HI>Le Noble,</HI> and let me add, contin∣ed he, that we shall inseparably live to gether, and run the same fortune; done said, <HI>Susetta,</HI> and I will conclude with this that we may not be bedfellows till we arrive at <HI>Paris,</HI> where I will dress me like a bride, to appear the more a∣greeably to you; mean time I shall be contented with these womens course dress; both cry'd <HI>Amen,</HI> and having in∣terchangably seal'd those Articles, with kisses upon their Cheeks, lips, and hands; now my dear <HI>Le Noble,</HI> said <HI>Su∣setta,</HI> I do present thee here with all that I am Mistress of, and all that thou canst command from her, who is thy most affectionate Mistress <HI>Susetta,</HI> with that she pull'd a great silk Purse out of her pocket, and having given it him, here take all, continued she, nay me and all, so giving it him, she s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t her self in his lap, and slung her armes about him, after <HI>Le Noble</HI> had given her a thou∣sand
<PB N="85" REF="49"/> kisses, and as many embraces, she saying she came not emptyhand∣ed to him, and that she had reserv'd nothing to her own particular use; but the Ring he had given her, as the first pledge of his affections; I should take it ill of thee, <HI>Susetta,</HI> said he, if thou shouldst part with that on a∣ny terms; but le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me see, what thou hast given me here, 'tis very heavy? Nay 'tis worth your perusal, I assure you, said <HI>Susetta,</HI> with that <HI>Le Noble</HI> Empties the Purse into his Hat, which he found was fill'd with Gold and a very little silver with it, a∣mongst which was <HI>Matthew Clods</HI> Ring. This Gold I would have you keep against a pinch, the Silver said <HI>Susetta</HI> will help to serve our pre∣sent occasions, and it comes very sea∣sonably. I'le assure thee Girl, said <HI>Le Noble,</HI> for I have been extrava∣gant since I see thee last; hold said she, first let me give full imformati∣ons, and then I will have an account of the time you have spent in <HI>Paris</HI> since you left me, here is a hundred and fifty Pistols, continued she, and
<PB N="86" REF="50"/> these papers are Bills of Exchange up∣on sight for eight hundred more, be∣sides half an years interest, which will be due, by that time we get to <HI>Paris?</HI> How Eight hundred, said <HI>Le Noble,</HI> nine hundred and fifty, besides the Silver, the interest, and this Dia∣mond Ring? thou art a Queen? Pri∣thy, what shall we do with all this money? Even be merry, make much of our selves, and love one another, reply'd <HI>Susetta:</HI> thou hast surpris'd me, said <HI>Le Noble,</HI> but I prithy now give me a full account, how thou camest by all this, I know that thy deceased gallant did give it thee in his Will and Testament, thou hast likewise inform'd me of some other particulars: But I beg of thee while we rest our selves here, that thou wouldst give me a full account of thy Life, and to induce her the more to it, he told her of his strange ad∣ventures at <HI>Paris</HI> and upon the Rode, with his odd Mascarading, which highly pleas'd her humour, being al∣ways very much taken with any thing that was rare and singular: after

<HEAD>The History of SƲSETTA.</HEAD>
<P>I was born some eighteen years since in the City of <HI>Roan</HI> in <HI>Norman∣dy,</HI> my Father was a Priest, who hav∣ing a pritty young woman to his house servant, he took a fancy to to her, and so between them I was Got, my Mother some time after I came into the World, took the pains to go out of it; and the goodman, my Father, what with sorrow for the loss of his dear <HI>Susanna</HI> (so was my Mother call'd) and partly to take a∣way all occasions of talk, which had been but too loud amongst the neigh∣bourhood concerning them two, he took to him a good old woman, who has ever since serv'd to look to his house, and dress his Meat; I was baptised <HI>Susetta,</HI> in remembrance of my Mother, and presently after sent to <HI>Cane,</HI> to be Nurs'd up by a Sister of my Fathers, who took a special care of me, according to the orders she had receiv'd from the good Priest,
<PB N="88" REF="51"/> he had a singular love for me, I be∣ing the only Child that he ever had, though some are of another opinion, who say, that the good Priest, not being able to give my Mother as much as she expected, she call'd a Gentle∣man to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he assistance, who took the pains to make me: But let that pass, the good Priest being pleas'd to own me for his Daughter, in gratitude I must acknowledge him for my Father. I was not quite seven years old, when being impatient to live any longer without the continual sight of me, sent for me home, he did ex∣press all the kindness imaginable to me, and when I was grown up to it, set me to learn all the pritty things and Exercises that young Maids use, and ever after, passing all over <HI>Roan</HI> for his Sisters Daughter, I call'd him my Uncle and he me his Neece: Be∣fore I was quite fifteen, I had ap∣pear'd agreeable in the Eyes of divers persons, whom would fain have been nibbling. But the good man, who ever carried a watchful eye o∣ver me, would put them all by; some
<PB N="89" REF="51"/> he thought too wild, others too rich, some again too poor, and others too sober; yet guessing by himself, and my Mothers constitutions of what temper I might be, and remembring that Cat will to kind, he endeavour'd to find out a fit match to rid his hands of me, so soon as he could, knowing that a Maid at fifteen is the most difficult thing in the World to be kept, resolving if he once met with a man to his mind, to bestow me upon him, with that he had ga∣thered, during his forty years service in the Church. Amongst the rest of my Suiters, for I had many and of all sorts, there was one that the good man did approve of; he was an ill bred Chip of an rough hewen block: And doubtless, directly descended from the ancient family of the Clowns, and nearly allied to that of the <HI>La Fooles:</HI> But he was very rich, and a thriv∣ing man, and consequently esteem'd a very fit match for me, by my good Unkle, who did not consider that it was very reasonable if he would cut that I should choose, however I was of
<PB N="90" REF="52"/> that mind, and I behav'd my self ac∣cordingly: At that time, there was also upon the ranks my lately deceas'd Lover, who stood stoutly in Compe∣tition with my Clown, for though the last was prefer'd; yet the Old man did admit of him also, to the exclusion of all other pretenders.</P>
<P>He was a Scotchman by Birth, a shirk by Education, a Pedant by Pro∣fession, a Beast in manners, and a Knave by nature. His Parents it was thought were a Merchant, such a one as I have been told, Sell Cloth up and down the streets in <HI>England,</HI> and a Trul, that a Tinker had cast off, for her two inseparable qualities, in∣continency and drunkenness, was his Mother, his name was <HI>Sawndy.</HI> But, as once he told me for brevity sake, he was call'd <HI>Bar-tho-lo-me-us.</HI> From an under-Usher that taught boyes to spell, he had in twenty eight years time attained to the Supremacy of a Writing-School. And through his miserable Covetousness, and hard Griping, and half starving of his Boarders, he had scrap'd together
<PB N="91" REF="52"/> all that we are now owners of.</P>
<P>Now I have given you an exact ac∣count of my two Lovers, give me leave to acquaint you with their man∣ner of wooing also.</P>
<P>My Clown, who was of a bashful nature, would frequently sit half a day by me, and not speak a word; and for fear I should divert him from that agreeable silence, neither would I say any thing to him, nor so much is look towards him, though his eyes were continually fixed upon me.</P>
<P>On a day, after he had sate some four hours before me, at a pritty di∣stance, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> last his Hat dropt at his feet, he being fast asleep, I see∣ing that, went hastily out of the Room, and locked the door after me, for I was not so hard hearted as to awaken him from so sweet a sleep, as some other more unkind would have done. But on the con∣trary, making the least noise I could, I retired, and there I left him enjoy∣ing his agreeable dreams, and went my wayes with the Key of the Room, to pass the Evening with a young
<PB N="92" REF="53"/> she companion of mine, our very next neighbour: We were sitting very attentively at our works, when there came in a couple more of young Maidens with an intention to be merry, while every one was asking; what we should do, and how we should pass away our time: It came into my head that my sleeping Gal∣lant, who I had left without fire or Candle, might be a fit subject for our nights recreation, with that I cast about within me, how I should contrive it, and having thought on something, I propos'd to the rest, that if they would joyn with me in a de∣sign I had, it would afford them sufficiency of Mirth, for to pass that Evening away, at the cost of one of my Lovers, who I had lockt up in a Chamber, where he was fallen a∣sleep.</P>
<P>Those three, mad Wenches that lov'd roguery as well as I did, that is with all their hearts, did present∣ly embrace the proposition, and e∣very one lent their invention to the composing of this frolick. By good
<PB N="93" REF="53"/> fortune, the good Priest my Unkle, being gone Supper to a friends house, we had more liberty and conveni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncy to act our Sport, therefore we presently went all to our house, taking along with us an overgrown Baboon, that was very tame and gentle, and a Cat also; we got all into a Parlour joyning the Room my Lover was in, whence we could hear him snore as if for a wager, having got all things that was thought necessary to carry our design in a readiness, we begun to prepare. Two of my Companions were dressing the Baboon all in white fixing a Candle in his head, while my other Comrade and my self, were fastening of Walnut shells, on the Cats Claws with Pitch, rubbing her back∣side with Ginger, and setting a pa∣pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ruff about her neck. This done, I went to open the door, while the others brought with them the Baboon and the Cat, they were presently let loose in the sleepers Room, after we had placed a piece of small searing Can∣dle in one of the Corners of the Chimney, which gave but a very
<PB N="94" REF="54"/> small light, the door being shut a∣gain, we stood at the Window with∣out, as much conceal'd as we could in expectation of the event, we had no sooner posted our selves, but we heard a most fearful ratling, which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Baboon made running after the Cat, our Chears, Tables, Cupboards, and all things in the Room, dragging his long Chain after him, with a most hideous noise, and the Cat did make such slidings upon the boards, who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she would endeavour to shun the Ba∣boon, as were very pleasant, and sometimes leaping against she hang∣ings to get out of the enemies reach, it would make such an odd kind of noise, when it fell down again upon the Nut shells, that it presently a∣wakened my poor slumbering Lover: But had you seen him, when yet be∣tween sleep and wake, he did but half discern, through the dim light in the Chimney (for that upon the Baboons head was extinguisht) what a fear seiz'd him, you would have laught your fill, he stair'd, his Hairs stood an end, his Face as pale as ashes, and all his
<PB N="95" REF="54"/> Limbs as stiff, as if he had been fro∣zen to death. But at last, the Cat being hard put to it, and forc'd for its safety to leap into the Lovers lap, the Baboon got immediately after it upon his shoulders, still as he run round after the Cat, winding his Chain about this poor Lovers neck, and then on a sudden giving it a twich as he was jumping down after the Cat, that had chang'd her quar∣ters, he pull'd the Lover down af∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him, all along upon the ground tugging with all his strength to get loose, and our Lover holding the Chain, with both his hands to prevent strangling, who at last cryed out, good sweet Master Devil, forgive me this time and let me loose again, and if ever I offer to think or dream of woman again, you shall do with me what you please, while he was with these and such like humble supplications, begging of the Devil for Life, the Baboon by force and violent s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rugling, having broke his Chain retir'd to the Corner of the Chimney near the Candle, and our
<PB N="96" REF="55"/> Lover thinking that the Devil had done this at his request, took the boldness to sit up, and then turn∣ing upon his knees, still having the Chain about his neck, he return'd his Devilship his most humble thanks, for his kind desisting, from torment∣ing him, promising him faithfully that if he ever he got on earth a∣gain, he would never think more of Mistress <HI>Susetta,</HI> for whom he did believe all this evil had befallen him; which was the more excusable in him added he, by reason that it was not of his own seeking, but of her Unkles, who would not let him be quiet, but still put him on to make Love to his Neece, thus was he go∣ing on with his excuses to his sup∣pos'd Devil, when the Baboon hav∣ing perceiv'd the Cat behind our Lover, made towards him with a great deal of eagerness; the Cat who had sound that place its best refuge, being loth to quit that post, so ad∣vantagious to him, did dodge round our Lover, and his Adversary after him, which set our Lover in such a
<PB N="97" REF="55"/> fright, that he run up and down the Room over all he met in his way, and crying but, murther, Devils, help, as loud as he could roar, tumbling in the dark over Chairs and Stools, till at last being quite spent, he fell down on a sudden, crying out that he was dead.</P>
<P>That word, and we seeing him lie without motion, did set us all in some apprehension that the fool might die with fear: Therefore I went and open'd the door where he lay, and presently we stole all away, to give him leave to do so likewise. The door of the Chamber had not been long open, when the Cat run out of it into the Yard, from whence she crept into a small hole, where the Ba∣boon, who had followed her close, at the Heels, was forc'd to leave off his Chase, the noise that those two Creatures had made in the Yard, hav∣ing been heard by the old woman (who had not heard any thing of that, which had been made in the Cham∣ber, because it was at a further distance, and the door and Windows shut) made haste down stairs, to see what
<PB N="98" REF="56"/> was the matter, at which we all ran out of the house, into that from whence we came, and the Baboon after us: As we pass'd by the Window, we hear'd our poor Lover groan, and say, I wonder whether I am dead or no, this set us out of fears, so that we went, and sate us down up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a bench, that was before our neigh∣bours door, laughing most heartily at the trick we had put upon my Lover; which, I hope, would deter him from e're coming more near our door.</P>
<P>We had but just undress'd the Ba∣boon and let him in, when my Un∣kle came by from his Company, with whom he had supp'd and drank'd so plentifully, that he pass'd by and did not know me. But went into his house and pull'd the door after him; being come into the Yard he over heard this Dialogue, which pass'd between the Lover and the Old wo∣man, which I also heard hearkening at the Window of the street.</P>
<P>The Old woman, who had been searching about to know what was the cause of that noise, was come at last to
<PB N="99" REF="56"/> the Chamber door, where our Lover lay on the floor, in the dark, amongst a com∣pany of tumbled Chairs, Stools, Cushi∣ons, and Carpets: She having heard him fetch a deep sigh, <HI>Jesu Maria,</HI> whose there, said she; our Lover hearing a humane voyce, with such a pious van-guard to its interrogation, he pluck'd up a little heart, and thus made answer, <HI>Pater Noster,</HI> it is I, and who in the name of all the she Saints in Heaven are you, continued the wo∣man; in the Name of all the he Saints on Earth, I am <HI>Matthew Clod,</HI> that have been tormented in Hell all this Night, by two furious Devils, which have but very lately left me, in a most sad pickle, for Heavens sake con∣tinued he, say all the <HI>Kyry's,</HI> you know, and all the <HI>Aves</HI> for my soul, for though I think this place is too cold to be Hell, yet I believe I am in pur∣gatory: in Purgatory, reply'd the Old woman, Heavens forbid that my Ma∣sters house were a Purgotary, why do you not see that you are in the very Room, in which you use to make Love to one <HI>Susetta.</HI> Oh speak not a
<PB N="100" REF="57"/> word more of that I beseech you, reply'd my Lover, least that the Devils return and torment me again. Why sure, you are mad said the woman, so coming nearer him with the Can∣dle, the tippled Priest, mean time, stole up to his Chamber with an intention to clear his house from those evil spirits. The old woman having seen what a confusion was in the room, and be∣held poor <HI>Matthews</HI> face all bloody. I think the Devils have been here in∣deed, said she, Lord what a stink they have left behind them? But in the name of wonder, how came you here, at this time o'th' night? Why truly reply'd <HI>Matthew,</HI> all that I know of it is, that I being fast asleep in bed at home, the Devils have drag'd me hither with this Chain about my neck, and having brought me into this dark room, where I use to gaze on <HI>Susetta,</HI> these cruel Devils, or Spirits, I know not which, but one of the two I am sure of, have set me in this pickle, and all the things thus confusedly scattered about the room. But now you talk of our <HI>Susetta</HI> where is she, said the
<PB N="101" REF="57"/> old woman; pray Heaven she be safe, at this the Cat with the Wallnut shels having been disturb'd from its rest by the Priest, who took it for a Devil by the noise it made, and the ruff a∣bout its neck, came for refuge into that room again, at which poor <HI>Mat∣thew,</HI> more affrighted than ever, cry'd out as loud as ever he could, the Devil is come again, the old woman hearing and seeing the Cat in that dress, in her fright took it for no less then an Imp, which made her run hastily out of the Chamber, just as her Master was running into it, in pursuit of the Cat, they run so furi∣ously against one another, that they both threw themselves backwards up∣on the floor; the poor woman with her fright and her fall, was in a sound, and the poor Priest very much indamag'd, but he being pot valliant, and by good fortune his hollowed Candle, which he had in his hand having kept light∣ed, besides all his holy attire, the holy water, the Cross, and the book of Exorcism, which he had about him, in which things he put great confi∣dence;
<PB N="102" REF="58"/> all these things; I say, did high∣ly insence him against those evils Spi∣rits that did haunt his house, he hastily arose to proceed forward, the Priest be∣ing got into the Room, and having be∣held all this confusion, he began his Exorcism. The old woman lying all this while on her back, with her Cloaths half up, the Candle in her hand, <HI>Mat∣thew</HI> taking the Priest for an Illusion crying out, Murther, the Devils, more Spirits come to torment me, not once daring to move from with∣in the middle of the Chair frame, where he was got, I having had my fill of laughing, I went to the door which I found but latcht, having got in, and advanced so far as the door of the Chamber, I receiv'd a good flap on the Chaps, which my Unkle gave me with his Holy water sprinkling, he assuredly taking me for another Spirit than I was, at this <HI>Matthew</HI> fell a roaring worse than ever, crying out? Oh, and is the chief Devil come hither also, now there's no hopes left, I am dead, I am dead, and so lay gron∣ing: by this time the Priest was mumb∣ling
<PB N="103" REF="58"/> of his Charmes, and now and then throwing of hollowed water at me, I adventured to ask him what was the matter, making my self the greatest stranger to all this that could be, he continued his muttering without an∣swerings, I had a good mind once to to have pull'd him by the Arm, but then again I durst not, when I remem∣bred the blow he had given me, least I should bring some further mischeife upon my self; I perceiving that I could do no good there; I came to the old woman again, I took her up, and as∣sured her, that I was no Apparition, but the most real <HI>Susetta,</HI> at last I per∣swaded her to go up with me in my Chamber, where after I had told her, that all this confusion had happened through a trick, that I and some of my Companions had put on <HI>Matthew,</HI> she having put me to bed, went down staires again, to undeceive the rest.</P>
<P>She found them in the same posture that we had left them in, so soon as she came near my Unkle he besprink∣led her with holy water, of which he was very lavish, at which she said to
<PB N="104" REF="59"/> him come, come, tis time to leave off your Conjurings, and you (turning towards <HI>Matthew</HI>) your folly, you may even thank that unlucky patch <HI>Su∣setta</HI> for all this, she it was, that brought in all those Devils which have so affrighted you both, to which the Priest with a deal of wrath and in∣dignation, made this reply avoyd thou Satanness, that woulds delude me, and this poor miserable posses∣sed wretch, pointing at <HI>Matthew,</HI> I know thou art a deluding Devil, and I will send thee from me, with that he flung all the holy water he had left, in the old womans face, which she took so ill from him, that saying the Devil take you both, she went her wayes and came not near them all that might.</P>
<P>What the Priest, and his distressed lover did after, that I could never learn, but the next morning, the old woman and I rising early, we went down to see what was become of them, we found them both fast asleep, my Unkle in a Chair, and <HI>Matthew</HI> in the same posture we had left him, we a∣wakened
<PB N="105" REF="59"/> the good man, who was al∣most starv'd with cold, he at first wondred where he was, and told us that he had had a very strange dream, which he would tell us at some other time, but now he was so cold and sleepy that he would go to bed, he Chid us both for letting him fall a sleep in a Chair in so cold a place, and so away he went: but first you must know that while he slept we had divested him of all his Church Ornaments, and had laid them out of the way, and set all things else in their right places, except <HI>Matthew,</HI> who was in a Corner of the Room, wedged in the frame of the Chair that he could not be got out.</P>
<P>While I was getting the good man to bed, I told him, that when he should wake again, I would give him an account of that dream he spoke of, at which having answer'd, that I was a foolish Girl, turn'd himself to sleep. During the time I had employed my self in laying the good Priest to bed: The Old woman had awakened <HI>Matthew,</HI> and with much ado got him out of
<PB N="106" REF="60"/> the frame of the Chair, and having delivered him of the Chain that was about his neck, she was comforting him, and endeavouring, as well as she could, to perswade him of the truth of the business, but he still persisted in the belief, that all he had seen was real, while they two were thus ar∣guing the case, some body knockt at the fore door, I went to see who it was, and I found it to be one of <HI>Mat∣thews</HI> Fathers Plowmen, that was come to inquire after <HI>Matthew,</HI> who he said had not come home all night, I made him no other answer then that he should go into the yard, and turn into the Room on his right hand, which he did; I durst not appear, for fear of setting the fool into some new sit, which would have made us been the longer troubled with him, and I car'd not how soon we were quit of him, <HI>Matthew</HI> was very glad to see <HI>Clunch</HI> so near him, who told him that his Father had sent him to seek after him, who was much troubled at his absence, and that he was very glad to have found him in so good a place,
<PB N="107" REF="60"/> I think you have all ploted to make me mad, said <HI>Matthew,</HI> why, was not I at home, and in my own bed last night? No truly, reply'd <HI>Clunch,</HI> there was no body in all our house that did see you last night there, and no doubt but you would hardly a gone to bed without your Supper, besides I shut all the doors at ten of the clock, and I am sure that then you were not come home; well, reply'd <HI>Matthew,</HI> say what you will, and do what you will, but I know what I know, and feel what I feel, and think what I think, and I shall tell, my Father another story when I get home, and so I'le be gone, then shak∣ing his head, and leaning upon <HI>Clunch</HI> his shoulder, and dragging his legs after him, Good boy, continued he, I am going, but if ever you catch me h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re again, let all the Devils that tormented me last night, torment me ten thousand times more, I that hear∣kened to him all that while, got out of the way, that I might not be a new obstacle to his going, so away went he, and his man <HI>Clunch</HI> together, and
<PB N="108" REF="61"/> from that time I never did see him more.</P>
<P>When my Father was awake again the old woman and I were very busie in perswading him, that all which he had seen and done were real, but he would have it all a dream, and see∣ing, that do what we could, we could not perswade him to the contrary, and that he began to be angry, thinking we play'd too long upon him; we left him in his own opinion, and so there was no more of that business talk'd of, at that time.</P>
<P>How my Father and my poor Lover did make up the business between them, the next time they saw one an∣other, I know not, but thus much I can tell you, that by this roguery of mine, I was for a long time freed from all manner of importunities on that Fools account.</P>
<P>There reman'd still my Bony <HI>Scot,</HI> to whom I ow'd a good turn also, which I promised within my self to pay him so soon as I should have an op∣portunity to do it the good success that I had so lately had with my other
<PB N="109" REF="61"/> lover, did make me hope for as good a conclusion with this, but the for∣mer being more fool than knave, and this more knave then fool, I was to manage my self accordingly in my designes, which were easie to me, my natural inclination leading me alwayes to what was Roguish, and did con∣tinually furnish me with store of in∣vention, which made me not be long before I had given my <HI>Scot</HI> a dish of my cooking, he having heard by some means or other, that my other Lover came not so frequntly to visit me as he had done formerly, he took the ad∣vantage of his absence, as all Rivalls do, to follow me close and endea∣vour to strike me up before his Rival were aware of it, to that purpose he one day sent me this Copy of verses, they were so ridiculous and imper∣tinent, that with the often reading of them to make my self and my Com∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nions sport, I got them by heart, thus they began.</P>

That I
<PB N="115" REF="66"/> should think the time very long, till I did see him, which I fear'd would be more difficult than I had imagin'd, by reason that I had heard my Unkle exclaim very much against him that very day, but that in a very short time I would give him notice how he should come to me: that in the mean time, I desired him, to let me hear frequent∣ly from him, having sealed and di∣rected my Letter, I sent it by this mes∣senger.</P>
<P>The next day about three a Clock in the morning, it being very dark my Scot comes under my Chamber Win∣dow, and there having tun'd or rather untun'd an old broken Fiddle, he joyns his rank Voice to it, and Sang and scrap'd upon the Instrument those verses, which he had sent me before to the Tune of

<P>Having sent this Letter seal'd up, I went to acquaint some of my Roguish Companions with my intentions, and invite them to take share of the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h in which they were to assist me, foul wanted help, they who desired no∣thing more, did presently give me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assurance of their aid, the hour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣pointed being come, we all lay in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣buscade expecting his coming we were not long before we heard him coming. Now you must know that
<PB N="119" REF="68"/> our house had a pretty long yard to it, at one end of which was the house we dwelt in, which went into a large street, and at the other end of the yard was a place where we kept fewel, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it a Chamber, which by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>allness of the Window and the Iron <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs about it, did speak it the reliques <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, some ancient place of devotion which had fallen to decay. Nothing re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in'd standing but what I have now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntioned; he was no sooner come near the door, but I and three of my com∣panions disguis'd like men seiz'd up∣on him and presently muffling of him we hurried him away as to prison, let∣ing him understand by our discourses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we went, that he must be the person which we had order to secure. The darkness of the night favouring us as much as could be, we had him round <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one street into another, at last came back again upon our steps, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>esently we drove him up stairs be∣fore us, where having lockt the door upon him, there we left him in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rk: all the way he had been very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nportunate to know his Crime, and

To which we made no other answer, but that the person we had order to seize on, was to come by that very place, where we had seiz'd him, and at that very moment: that we thought it was for High Treason, and concluded, that if he was innocent, no doubt but he would be released, as soon as he should make it appear, that till then he was to have patience, and this was all he could get out of us, when we had laid him safe, my Comrades retl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d each to their own house, and I went to bed.</P>
<P>Now you must know that the room where we had pen'd up our Prisoner was commonly employ'd to keep Cheeses in, my Unkle usually letting it out for that purpose, out at that time it being in our own hands, there was nothing in it, but a little straw scatter'd up and down; these did our amorous Scot spend that night
<PB N="121" REF="69"/> no question with less satisfaction and content, than he had promised to him∣self when he first set forth upon his amorous adventure. The next morn∣ing, we of the Sisterhood of Roguery, did meet, according to our appoint∣ment, and having debated what we should do with our Prisoner, we re∣solv'd on this, which we presently put in execution; we all got into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower room, and there, as if we had then by chance in the stredt, we bid one another good morrow, under borrowed voices. Then wo began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lk, of marketing and of our Maid servants, one said to another, that she had heard strange news abroad, to which another said, what concerning the great design that was lately dis∣cover'd? I suppose, said the third, that's all the Town talk, they say that there is a certain Scotchman in this prison here that had an hand in it.

<P>I inquired of the good woman how he did, who made me answer, that he was become very pensive ever since his late rambling, and that no body could get from him where he had been. During his twenty four hours absence, neither would he be seen or spoken unto, that he had given her a special care to deliver that Note very privately into my own hands, with this the good woman sighing, I am afraid continued she, that he will fall suddainly very sick, or at least substracted with melancholly,
<PB N="129" REF="73"/> I making as if I pity'd him much, and having desired the Old woman to remember me kindly to him, I dis∣missed her, with an assurance that I should be alwayes glad to hear from him.</P>
<P>After this I had no news of my Scotish Lovel till now of late by rea∣son of the disorders that I fell in pre∣sently after, as follows,</P>
<P>The Priest my good Unkle and my other Lover <HI>Matthew,</HI> by what means, I know not, were pieced up again, as great as ever: Nay, it had gone so far between the Father, the Son, and the Unkle, that a Marriage was concluded upon, though without the consent of the Neece. One day my good Unkle being alone in his Cham∣ber, did send for me to him, and to make short, after many admonitions and remonstrances did positively con∣clude that within a certain day, I should prepare to be <HI>Matthew Clods</HI> Wife, I seeing that all the fair words and intreaties, that I made could not diswade the Priest from this his re∣sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, I a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> last in a passion pro∣test'd
<PB N="140" REF="74"/> that I would run away, or de∣stroy my self, rather than to become the Wife to such a Beast, and upon that in great rage I went out of the Old mans Chamber; my Unkle knowing that I was commonly as good as my word, in such matters, resolv'd to prevent me, in going a∣nother way to work. Therefore having sent his Old woman to call me back again, he told me that he had better considered of it, that he would not force me against my incli∣nations, that he would give me a longer time to resolve my self, and hoped I should find in time the great good and advantage, which was intend∣ed me in that Match. This did some∣thing appease me, and at least made me not so hastily put in execution, what I had deliberated within my self. But, the old Fox prov'd that time too crafty for the young one, for towards Even∣ing, the good Priest having call'd me to him, gave me a Letter, to carry to a certain Monastery of women, call'd <HI>La Filles Reparties,</HI> charging me to deliver it into the Abbesses own hands, I went
<PB N="141" REF="74"/> to the Convent, inquired for the Mo∣ther Abesse, and gave her the Letter as I had been charged to do, so soon as she had read it, looking upon me, she bid me follow her, having brought me into a Parlour, she call'd to her, two of the most grave women in the Company, here said she, to them, tak∣ing me by the hand: take this young Maiden into your safe custody, and give me an account of her, when e're I call for it, I by this time seeing my self trappan'd, I thought it was my best way to dissemble, and with a chearful countenance, I told the Ab∣bess that I was very glad, my Un∣kle had met so well with my own desires, and that since it is impossi∣ble for me to marry a person that I could never Love, I thought my self the most happiest Creature in the World, to be disposed of in so good hands, and that I should think the time long till I had gone through my year of probation, that I might take the vow; this pleas'd the Matrons and both my Guardians very well, who hoped they should not be much troubled in look∣ing
<PB N="132" REF="75"/> after me, since that my own in∣clinations led me to it: that very night my trunk and all things else belonging to me, were sent after me, with a Letter from my Uncle: In which there was Writ, that I had but two wayes to choose, either to resolve upon marrying of <HI>Matthew Clod</HI> within six dayes, or to live all the residue of my Life in that place; I told the Messengers, that was wait∣ing for my answer, that since it was my Unkles pleasure to have it so. Now that I had better thought of it, I was resolv'd to obey him in all things, and that he should dis∣pose, of me as he pleas'd.</P>
<P>This unexpected answer, did so re∣joyce the Old mans heart when he, heard it, that the next day he sent me a very kind Letter, with five new Gold∣en Lewesses in it and a Diamond Ring, with which <HI>Matthew Clod</HI> had desired, I should presented. This I thought did work very well in order to my future design, and seeming very well contented; It got me the liberty of the Cloyster and the Garden. One
<PB N="133" REF="75"/> day as I was walking towards Evening with some of the Nuns in the Gar∣den, perceiving a great Well with two large Buckets joyning to the Garden Wall, which was to furnish Water for the Garden: my curiosity did lead me to look into it, so that I went thither alone, and as I cast my eye in it, I saw a glimpse of a Candle, and heard some persons dis∣coursing. That made me the more c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rious, a while after I did perceive that the Candle was advanced into the Cavity of the well, through a Window towards the middle of it, and a little after, it was taken into the Window again, then I heard some body say. What a fine opportuni∣ty, would this be for some of the Nuns to steal out, or get a Gallant into them, if they did but know it: Especially, now that this Common shore is dry, and while we are mend∣ing of it, I needed no more, and hav∣ing took notice on which side the Window was, which was all over co∣vered with a Company of Weeds, that grew round it, I presently
<PB N="144" REF="76"/> went to my Company again.</P>
<P>Two Nights after, I took occasi∣on (after I had got about me all that I cared most for) to walk some∣thing later than ordinary in the Gar∣den, and when I was ask't whether I would not yet retire, it growing dark, I made answer, that my head that had aked all that day, being much better, since I had been in the Air, I would enjoy the advantage of it so long as I could, so the rest going in, I continued my walk, so soon as I saw the Coast clear, knowing that I should not be long without being call'd for, I made towards the Well, where I hastily set my self in one of the Buc∣kets, and holding with both my hands that part of the Rope, which was between the Pully and the other Buc∣ket, I gently poys'd my self down till I came to the Window, where having got in, I let go the Bucket again, which return'd to the same post<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, as before, I found my self in a dark, low, slimy, wet place; which way to stir I knew not, nor which way to get out of it, that made me wish my
<PB N="145" REF="76"/> self in the Garden again, with all my heart. But considering, that it was not wishes but actions, that should get me out again, now that I was in, I resolv'd to go any way for∣ward. It happen'd that I took that which after a long time brought me to the River side, where that Com∣mon-shore did empty it self, when it was running, I had so much light a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to perceive it was not even with the ground, but of what hight from it I could not judge; I set my self down, to try whether my feet would then reach the ground, and as I was reaching out one foot as far as I could, the slimyness that was upon the stones, made me slip quite off and down came I to the ground, on which I fell so soft, that I had no other hurt than what the fear had giv∣en me, so soon as I had recover'd my self, I endeavoured to get from that nasty place, but I was so heavy with the great quantity of Mud that did stick very thick all about me, that I was forced to leave one of my pet∣ticoats behind me, which I did sink
<PB N="136" REF="77"/> in the Mud, that it might not be∣tray me, I had not gone far upon a Gravel and Sandy bank, but that I met with a Waterman in his Boat who ask'd me, how I came there, I told him, that in the dark I had accidentally fallen off of the bridge in a Muddy place, which had sav'd me from hurting my self, that if he would carry me over the Water, where I was going when I had fal∣len, I would pay him well, he pre∣sently took me into his Boat, and car∣ried me over: As we were crosing the Water, I ask't him, if he knew e're a house that I might go into to dry my self, because I was so wet, and dirty, that I could not go any further till I had made my self clean, he told me that if I would go to his house, I should be very welcome, and that I should Lie in his Daughters bed with her, while his old Wife should clean my Cloaths. I was glad to hear that, and did assure him to be grateful to him: We came on shore, and the good old man according to his word, did l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad me to his house, where a
<PB N="137" REF="77"/> good fire was made, at which having very well warm'd and dry'd my self I went to bed to the young Maiden, taking with me in my handkercheif, what I had in my pockets.</P>
<P>In the morning early, my Cloaths were brought to me, very clean and dry, but much stain'd, with the blackness of the mud I was wishing that I had any other for them, they did so stink I told them; when the good woman looking over them very well, and finding that they were of fine stuff, and almost new, told me that if I pleas'd she would give me her Daughters new petticote and Westcoat for them, and thank me to boot, I presently agreed to it, and I had no sooner put them on which fit∣ted me very well, but that the old woman told me, that by this change, she was out of a great trouble which she had been in, to get her Daughter some Wedding Cloaths, and that mine came very seasonably; for that pur∣pose, I having given them something for their pains, I desired the good woman to let her Daughter guide me
<PB N="148" REF="78"/> into the Road that went from <HI>Roan</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> and that then I should find out my way home again well enough but that I did not know where I was at present the good woman did pre∣sently grant me my request, and the young Maiden having brought me where I desired, she left me.</P>
<P>I was very well pleas'd that I had so fortunately got into a dress that did so well disguise me, I was walking along the Road when a Cart did overtake me, they that drove it ask'd me where I was going so early, I answered to the next Town, they told me, that if I would make them drink, they would carry me thither with that I having promis'd them a pot of Sider they got me up into the Cart where I rested my self, and was carried some three leagues towards <HI>Paris.</HI> I had not been long in the village after I had given those fellows money to drink, but the stage Coach from <HI>Roan</HI> to <HI>Paris</HI> came by, there was but one pas∣senger in it, and that was a woman, the Coach-man seeing me on foot told me that if I would go to <HI>Paris</HI> he
<PB N="149" REF="78"/> would carry me thither very cheap, I told him that if he would carry me, but within half a days journey of <HI>Paris,</HI> I would give him content; we agreed upon two Crowns, of which the one I gave in hand, this was a great satis∣faction to me, especially having the Company of a good Gentlewoman, who being pleas'd with my carriage and discourse did take me for her bed∣fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low, and paid for my diet all the way, at the dinner of the last day I p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id the Coach-man his other Crown, and so he went his way with the old Gentlewoman, and I stay'd behind, the place they had left me in, being a Market Town, and the next day Mar∣k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t day, I had the curiosity to walk in∣to the Market, and there amongst the rest of the Country Lasses, I heard one shy to another that she was weary of her place, because it was an In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and she not being us'd to be where Travellers and people of fashion re∣scu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted she did not know how to be∣have her self amongst persons that ex∣pected so much attendance, and re∣spect which she did not know how to
<PB N="140" REF="79"/> pay them, that if she could get any body to be in her stead me would wil∣lingly resign her place to them, and and return home to her Father to look after the dary which was her element, this discourse made me think that it might prove a good place for me to re∣tire unto, (I daring, not trust my self to that little world <HI>Paris</HI>) and there stay; till I heard news from my friends, and how my concerns did stand at <HI>Roan,</HI> I addressed my self to the Maid, and told her that if she would help me to that place, she had newly mention'd, I should be thank∣ful to her. The Maid presently made me answer that if I would go with her she would carry me thither behind her, not doubting but that my good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em would give me a welcome.</P>
<P>The thing prov'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Maid had said; for she had no sooner shew'd me to her Master, and told him that she had provided me to be in her place, but he seem'd to be very well pleas'd at it, and so I was entertained. That night I lay with that Maid who I was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o∣ceed; she inform'd, me of the work
<PB N="141" REF="79"/> which I was to do, which was about the Chambers. The next morning I gave her thanks, with something to buy her a pair of Gloves, after which she went her wayes, and I remain'd in her Room.</P>
<P>It was in that place, where about a fortnight after, I had the good fortune to be instrumental in the preservation of my dear <HI>Le Noble,</HI> for which I shall ever be thankful to my Stars, for hav∣ing by that means, endear'd my self to you.</P>
<P><HI>Le Noble</HI> having kiss'd and given her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thousand, thanks for her pleasant story, and those kind expressions that she concluded it withal. But my Dear <HI>Susetta,</HI> continu'd he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> In all thy Travels, hadst thou never any affronts offer'd thee? Nor no attempts upon thy cha∣stity? My dear <HI>Le Noble,</HI> reply'd <HI>Suset∣ta:</HI> It is not so long, since I have giv∣en my self up unto thee without any reserve, that I should so soon forget it. I cannot deny, but that diuers at∣tempts have been made upon me, by such as had a good opinion of my per∣son, though not so of my Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>
<PB N="152" REF="80"/> But besides the assurance that I now give thee, that never any body did succeed; thou shalt find, that I come a pure Maid into thy embraces. With that hiding her blushes in his bosome. Think not the worse of me, continu∣ed she, my dear <HI>Le Noble,</HI> for being so free with thee, but attribute this to my Natural humour, and remember that I will be as true and faithful to thee, as if we were married according to all those formalities, which the Law of the Land does require, I must con∣fess that I am young and wild; yet I am not so ignorant, but that I know Marriage to be the Union of man and woman together, by the ties of sincere Vows and Protestations, to be faithful and true to one another, and so to live together in constant Love and mutu∣al affection, till those Vowes be dissolv∣ed by the death of one of the parties, or by the mutual consent of both? But what the Laws and Customes bind us unto, are things brought in to necessary conveniences, and not entirely essential. Nay, I know f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rther, contined she, that men will and
<PB N="153" REF="80"/> do commonly take more liberty in the State of Marriage; then the modesty of our Sex does usually allow us. Therefore I shall not wonder, if my dear <HI>Le Noble,</HI> does as the rest of men: But one thing I shall desire, that he would promise me: which is, that he would ever prefer me in his affecti∣ons to all others, and as to the rest, let him take his liberty, which I freely do grant to him.</P>
<P>These kind expressions from <HI>Su∣setta,</HI> could not but make a great im∣pression upon <HI>Le Nobles</HI> generous spi∣rit, who in gratitude, did return her many kind assurances that he would ever have an high esteem for her, and more love than for any one else. That he would never consent to a separati∣on except they both did see an un∣avoidable necessity for it, which o∣therwise would render them both mi∣serable; that he had too tender an af∣fection for her, to purchase his plea∣sure and satisfaction, at so dear a rate as her ruine. With that having a∣gain, given one another a thousand kisses, and as many other testimonies
<PB N="144" REF="81"/> and assurances of affections, they went to Supper, <HI>Susetta</HI> promising <HI>Le Noble,</HI> to give him after Supper a full account of what had happened to her, during his stay at <HI>Paris,</HI> which she told him, would be worth his hearing.</P>

<PB N="45" REF="81"/> to all his Servants, not to say, that he was in the house, but if any body should come to ask after him, they should tell them, that he was gone to see a Brother of his, that was dying, and whose Heir he expected to be after that, my Master would all day long keep within his Chamber locked up; and at Nights he would take his Horse, ride out, and come home again in the Morning before day: This had continued five or six weeks, when one Night there came in a Gentleman on Horseback, to Sup and Lye at our house, he presently call'd to be con∣ducted to a bed Chamber, which was accordingly done: I perceived that he had lookt very earnestly upon me, by the way to his Chamber, he gave charge that a Supper should be got ready with all diligence, for he would make haste to bed, that he might be gone in the morning before day. An hour after I was call'd for up, to that Gentleman; I came, and I found my Master very merry with him, and busie in discourse, which made me offer to go back again, thinking that
<PB N="146" REF="82"/> my Master had supply'd him, with what he wanted, but my Master step∣ping to the door, and taking me by the hand, did pull me by force, and and then shov'd me into the Travellers arms, saying, take her, she is yours: to which I answer'd, that there were more than two words to that bargain, and that though I was his Servant for the present, yet so long as I was not his Slave, he had no right to Give or Sell me; my Master told the Gentleman, that he should not mind my talk, that I was a young foolish Girl, but that he should teach me better things in a short time, with that the stranger beginning to be some∣thing rude, I protested that if he would not desist, I would shrick or call out so loud, that the whole house, and all the Neighbourhood should hear me, with that the Gen∣tleman did let me go, and I presently flung out of the Chamber, and would not come there any more, but I went immediately to a good old wo∣mans house our next Neighbour, whence notwithstanding all they
<PB N="147" REF="82"/> could do or say, I did not return home, till news were brought me that the Gentleman and my Master were gone to bed. When I found the Coast clear, I went and lay upon my bed with my Cloaths on, where I had not been two hours, but that my Chamber door was broke open, I pre∣sently seiz'd on, gagg'd, and bound, and set before a man on Horseback, who carried me away in the dark and si∣lence of the Night, notwithstanding all the resistance that I could make, we had not rid two Leagues, when we were overtaken by the Gentleman, who had offered some rudeness to me the night before: It was then just break of day, which afforded as much light, as served me for to know him a∣gain, at the sight of him, I conclud∣ed that their design was to ravish me, and after that to cut my Throat and cast me into some hole: These appre∣hensions seizing on my Spirits all at once, and on such a sudden made me fall into a swound, which being per∣ceiv'd by him, that held me on Horse∣back, they got me off of the Horse,
<PB N="148" REF="83"/> in a place out of the Rode, where when I came to my self again, I found that I was unbound, ungagg'd, and unlaced, the Gentleman holding my head in his lap, while his man was gone to look for water, with which he return'd a little after I had come to my self again. I began to struggle a lit∣tle, and offer to get my head from his lap, when he thus spoke to me with a discompos'd voice and a trembling fit, which I was sensible was upon him.</P>
<P>Fair Maid, if it is your plea∣sure, to have your head off of me, at least be pleas'd to rest it against this Tree, while you hear what I shall say, with that having laid his Cloak in a heap against the Tree, he laid my head upon it, end afterwards did thus conti∣nue his discourse: Had not that base man your Master given me an ill cha∣racter of you, I had never made any further attempt upon your Chastity; for I was so fully perswaded by your first resistance, and the high resent∣ment which you expressed last night, both in your words and actions, that
<PB N="149" REF="83"/> I had never attempted any thing fur∣ther, but that he did assure me, that it was not the first time you had done so with others, to whom you had freely yeilded to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> last, these words, and his assurance, that he would bring you to yield to go away with me in the Morn∣ing, made me pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with twenty Pistols, which I had bargained with him for you. But now, that I find you quite another person, then he represented you to me; I hear do swear, by all that is sacred to offer you, not the least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣olence, and I do most heartily beg your pardon, for what I have done, assu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing you, that if ever I can gain your af∣fections with kindnesses and services, I shall think my self most happy, out that I will never endeavour to make my self so by any base means, for proof whereof, continued he, if you please <HI>I</HI> shall immediately return you back, or carry you to any other place, you shall please to command me, he further added, that if her Master had not assur'd him, that <HI>I</HI> was gone be∣fore very well satisfied, he would ne∣ver have come after me, but to have
<PB N="150" REF="84"/> brought me back again, as he was still ready to do.</P>
<P>These things with some more he did speak with such an ayr and ac∣cent, as made me give credit to what he said, which having somewhat re∣viv'd my Spirits, <HI>I</HI> thus reply'd to him, Sir, to shew you that <HI>I</HI> give faith to your words, <HI>I</HI> humbly beg of you on my knees, that you would take pity on a poor distressed young Maid, and according to these assurances, you have given me of your civil carriage to∣wards me for the future, you would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleas'd to carry me any whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, but where that Monster is. If it were your conveniency, <HI>I</HI> continu'd, <HI>I</HI> had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther go to <HI>Cane,</HI> than any where else: But, <HI>I</HI> fear, it is too far, at which the Gentleman, did presently reply, that though he could not get thither, without the hazard of his Life, yet to shew me, that nothing should deter him from serving me with all his pow∣er, he would conduct me there, being confident, by my discourse and actions, that <HI>I</HI> was another person that <HI>I</HI> pas∣sed for, and such a one as he did not
<PB N="151" REF="84"/> doubt but did deserve a thousand times more and greater services, I having in∣form'd him, that if I once got safe to <HI>Cane,</HI> by his meanes, he might know something further of my condition, he set me one horse back, behind that fel∣low that had carried me out of the Inn, where I did sit, till we came to the next place, where I might be fit∣ted with such things as were neces∣sary for a woman that rides on horse back.</P>
<P>About two hours after we came to a Market Town, where I was put in∣to a Coach, which by good fortune was going to <HI>Cane,</HI> in which there was an empty place; It was a Gentle∣mans Coach, but my Gentleman did prevail with the Company in it, to let me have a place, and giving some∣thing to the Coachman he had the li∣berty, to tye a Cloak bag behind the Coach, which did much ease his mans horse, that otherwise must have been left behind; having eaten something for breakfast, and treated the com∣pany that was in the Coach, which were but Servants that tended upon
<PB N="152" REF="85"/> two young Children: the Coachman drove towards <HI>Cane,</HI> at dinner time my Gentleman did again treat the whole Company for my sake, and shewed me much more respect than my habit did require, which made the Company do the like, though they wondred at it, especially at his great care of me, never abandoning the Coach-side on horse back, so long as I was in it;</P>
<P>It was about the dusk of the even∣ing, and we had not above three or four miles farther to go to our Inn that night, when there suddenly came half adozen men well mounted, upon a full speed, they presently seiz'd on the Coach-horses, and having cut their harnesses turn'd them loose, while o∣thers were busie about my Gentleman, who making resistance, was shot with a brace of Bullets through the head, with which he fell off of his horse stone dead, the Coach was presently ransackt, the Gentlemans man so soon as he saw his Master on the ground, fled as fast as his horse could carry him, and all the goods that were in the
<PB N="153" REF="85"/> Coach, were taken out and carried a∣way; this business was done on such a sudden and with such dispatch, that there was not much more time spent in the execution, then I have em∣ploy'd in the relation of it; since my getting out of the Convent I had alwayes carried all the gold I had with the Diamond Ring in a little purse, which I constantly wore in my bosome, day and night, in that also was the Ring which you had given me, those that robb'd us had not had time to strip us, by that means I sav'd all <HI>I</HI> had, ex∣cept some Silver, which was in my poc∣ket, my papers <HI>I</HI> found again scatter'd about the Coach, and upon the Road, and the small bundle of Cloaths, which did belong to me that had been given to the fellow, that carried me away, <HI>I</HI> found afterwards by good fortune in in that Cloak bag, which belong'd to the dead Gentleman, it had been taken up on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad by some Servants that belong'd to a company of Gentlemen, which came up to us, not above a quarter of an hour after, we had been robb'd, who finding us in that sad con∣dition
<PB N="154" REF="86"/> did presently conclude, that those persons they had met were they, that had done the deed, who knowing by their spies, that they were too strong a party, and so near them, it had made them make such extraordinary hast in plundering us, one of the Gen∣tlemen asking whose Cloak bag that was, one of the Coach company made answer that it was mine, upon that it was given me, the first thing that was done after they had found no life left in the poor Murdered Gentleman, was to send their Servants, which were six in number, some to get the Coach hor∣ses and the Gentlemans also, which was run away after the Coach horses, so soon as his Master was fallen, and and the rest to Gallop to the next town, to get some conveniency to car∣ry the dead body thither, mean time the Gentlemen began to examine to whom the Coach did belong, and those pritty Children, that were in it the Ser∣vants did answer, that they belonged to a Gentleman, which they named, which they had been to fetch from their Grandmothers, where they had been for
<PB N="155" REF="86"/> some time, and that they were going with them to their Fathes house, who liv'd within two or three leagues of <HI>Cane,</HI> this made the Gentlemen the more ready and diligent in assisting us, because they knew the Gentleman, and there was such care taken, that in two hours time there came a Cart in which the dead body was lay'd, and the Harness of the Coach were made fit to carry us to the Inn, where we were conducted by the Gentlemen: during the way, <HI>I</HI> having told my company that <HI>I</HI> was a meer stranger to the Gen∣tleman, <HI>I</HI> earnestly entreated two wo∣men that were in the Coach, to own me as one of their fellow servants, as they might perceive, that the Gentle∣men did take me to be, which they promis'd me to do, and they were as good as their word, and very civil to me all the way, concluding that it was my good face that had made the Gentleman so kind to me, of which kindnesses they had been made large partakers; being come into the Inn, we women and the Children where pre∣sently had into one room, where
<PB N="156" REF="87"/> there was three beds, as we had de∣sired. There we supp'd altogether, lockt our selves in, and had a great deal of Womens that, amongst which <HI>I</HI> gave them a particular account of what had so lately befallen to me.</P>
<P>I being out of danger as I thought, and my fears being blown over, I had got into a jolly humour, which did please my company so well, that they declar'd they were very glad they had met with so good company as I was, then in a merry humour having shew'd them, by pulling my Purse out of my Bosome, how I had frustrated the Rob∣bers of a good Booty, they having lost all their money. After they had look'd a pritty while upon the two Rings they said, that they did imagine that I was some other person than I appear'd to he, which now I had confirm'd, I being desirous to draw them still more and more into a good opinion of me, that <HI>I</HI> might keep my place the rest of the jour∣ney in the Coach, without which I did not know what I should do. I told them <HI>I</HI> was a Gentlemans Daughter of <HI>Roan.</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="87"/> Who having been compell'd, to pro∣mise my Parents that I would marry a person that I could not Love, to shun a Recluse Life in a Monastry, I had the day before the Marrige, stoln away from them; That my design in going now to <HI>Cane,</HI> where I had some Relation, was to learn in some disguise, how my affairs stood there, and endeavour my Peace with my Parents, with whom I should never be reconcil'd without the breaking off of that match, which <HI>I</HI> did so abhor, that I would rather chuse death than it. That thereform, I earnestly begg'd of them to assist mo in what they could, they not knowing how soon it might be their condition: To this I added, that <HI>I</HI> had a great mind to dress me in mans apparel, both to keep me from being known, as also because <HI>I</HI> thought it the safest qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e secure me for the future, from such dan∣gers as <HI>I</HI> had so lately escaped. <HI>I</HI> spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> these things with so much passion and tenderness, that <HI>I</HI> won them wholly to me, one of them promising, that she would bring me to her Mothers house, that was not far from that place where
<PB N="158" REF="88"/> they were going, and within two little leagues of <HI>Cane,</HI> where <HI>I</HI> should be very welcome, and where <HI>I</HI> should receive all manner of civil usage and services, such as good Countrey people could afford.</P>
<P>From that time, I was treated with more respect than before, and when we were weary of chatting it grow∣ing late, they gave me the choice of a bed by my self, where I slept all night without awaking: To make short, my dear heart, we all got safe to our jour∣nies end, I was conducted to the maid's Mothers house, where while a mans black suit, which was with other things in the Cloak bag, fitting for me, I sent to <HI>Cane</HI> for a Perriwig, a Hat, a Sword, and all other things fitting to make me a compleat Cavaller, having all things ready to appear in publick, after I had return'd the people of the House many thanks for all their kind∣nesses to me, I went to <HI>Cane,</HI> where I was no sooner arriv'd, but I got a Mes∣seng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, who carried me a Letter to my Scotch Lover, from whom I thought, I should get a better account
<PB N="159" REF="88"/> then any body else could give me of all my concerns: Not doubting, but that his Love to me, would have made him very inqulsitive after me, and that the same love would quickly bring him to me. If I did but in the least desire it: Not doubting, but to shake him off a∣gain, when I should think it convenient. The Letter was much to this purpose.</P>

<P>The Messenger that carried it, found him desperately ill, in so much that he thought, he could not live to the Jour∣nies end, that he had been so overjoy'd at the reception of my Letter, that he had immediately given order to get a
<PB N="160" REF="89"/> Litter ready to carry him the next morning out of Town, to take the air, as he pretended, with that he gave me a Letter from him, and <HI>I</HI> assure you, Sir, continu'd the fellow: No Lover, could have made more Caresses to a Let∣ter, from his beloved Mistress, than he made of yours, which he believ'd he had seen him kiss twenty times, and read as often over in private; and that every body in the house were wondring at so great a change in him, which made them very inquisitive to know of me, whether it came not from a young Gen∣tlewoman. I told my Messenger, to take of all suspition, that though it came from me, yet, that there was such news in it from a Gentlewoman; as would as much please him But since he is so ill as you say, <HI>I</HI> have a mind to meet him upon the Rode, least his death should prevent me from accomplishing that good office which <HI>I</HI> have promised my kinswoman to do for her having thus said to the Messenger, <HI>I</HI> opened the Letter, in which, <HI>I</HI> read as fol∣lows</P>

</LETTER>
<P>By this <HI>I</HI> found though he could not leave off his Plague of Rhime, that he was really very ill, of which <HI>I</HI> did inform the Messenger; who told me that he had swounded twice away the Writing of those few lines, about which he had spent two hours time at least. This made me employ this fel∣low, to get me immediately a Horse, to be going that very day to meet him.</P>
<P>Mean time <HI>I</HI> was very well pleas'd within my self at all this, by which <HI>I</HI> found <HI>I</HI> should the sooner and the easier compass my ends, then <HI>I</HI> could
<PB N="162" REF="90"/> ever have imagin'd, if <HI>I</HI> did but find him alive. The fellow having got me a Horse: We both presently set forwards, we were got a little above halfway to <HI>Roan,</HI> where we met with my poor <HI>Lover,</HI> who was laid in bed in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Inn of a Market Town: Not being able to pursue his Journey any further. He had been so prudent, not to men∣tion a word of me to any body; there∣fore, when <HI>I</HI> came to his bedside, tak∣ing him by the hand, <HI>I</HI> did softly whis∣per in his ear, that <HI>I</HI> was his <HI>Susetta,</HI> come to meet him in that dis∣guise, that <HI>I</HI> might not be discover'd: He presently started up, holding me fast by the hand with both his, and having given order that every body in the room, should retire: He did endeavour to express, as well as he could, what joy he receiv'd at the sight of me. Though he fear'd that it was too late to continue long, the grief which he had taken for my loss, having come so near his heart, that it had reduc'd him to that sad extremity, in which <HI>I</HI> saw him. Adding that his greatest trou∣ble
<PB N="163" REF="90"/> had been how to order things so, that in case <HI>I</HI> should ever be found again, <HI>I</HI> should inherit all that he would leave to me at his decease: That <HI>I</HI> should now pass for a Ne∣phew of his, though he had no re∣lation that he knew of, and that he would forthwith make his Will, but if it were possible, he would willingly be remov'd to some private house out of Town, because that the perpetual noise of that place he was in would not let him take any rest. And so he concluded, <HI>I</HI> having return'd him many thanks, and once more assur'd him of my affections, we broke off our private discourse: He having bid me call for <HI>Megerlain,</HI> to whom he gave order to get things ready to remove pesently: He desired that <HI>I</HI> should retire to take my Rest, while he would endeavour to do the like, to make him the more able to endure the Removing; with that he turn'd to sleep, and <HI>I</HI> went to another Room, where having call'd for a Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Ink to Write for an E∣minent Physician at <HI>Paris,</HI> to come
<PB N="164" REF="91"/> to my Unkle (as <HI>I</HI> call'd him) <HI>I</HI> Writ that Letter, which brought you to me. Not long after, I was call'd to him again, he not being able to rest for the Noise, he bid me take care of his Removal, which I presently order'd: We were no sooner come to the House, which I had caus'd to be taken for him, but he call'd for all the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sons be∣longing to it, and, in the presence of them all, he did declare, that <HI>I</HI> was his Nephew, and next Heir at Law, and that he would have every body, follow my directions.</P>
<P>This was the place wherein I had f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the happiness to embrace my Dear <HI>Le Noble,</HI> who, I hope, will not have the worse opinion of his poor <HI>Susetta,</HI> for having given him so true and just an account of her whole Life, since it was in obedience to his Com∣mands.</P>
<P><HI>Le Noble</HI> having thank'd her and assured her, that if it were possible to Love her more then he did already, the Candidness she had us'd in the delivery of her own story, and the
<PB N="165" REF="91"/> freeness which he found in all her other discourses and actions, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oll <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it. That he intreated her to believe, that he really and cordially did love her, and would e∣ver continue so to do, with that <HI>Su∣setta</HI> seeming desirous to sleep, <HI>Le No∣ble</HI> having taken his leave of her, was retiring into his Chamber, which was on the other side of the house, when <HI>Susetta,</HI> calling him back, told him, that hence forwards she would discharge her self on him, of the troublesome office of Purse∣bearer, so desired that he should take that which lay upon the Table along with him, and the Writings of concern: <HI>Le Noble</HI> reply'd, I will obey you in all things; and thrusting his hand into the Purse, he took out a handful of Gold and Silver mix'd together, and which laying upon the Table, but least you should be too troublesome, continued he, with frequent demanding for Pins and such like trifles, let this lye by you, to supply you with such dayly occasions, and presently draw∣ing
<PB N="166" REF="92"/> the door close after him, to take from her all occasion of reply, he retired to his Chamber, where I will leave him till the next Morn∣ing, which will produce some New Adventure, wherewith to begin the Second Part.</P>
