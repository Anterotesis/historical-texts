<P>THe confirmation of the unhappy encounter of Generall <HI>Lamboy</HI> with the Weymarish Armie, I have understood out of your last Letter; and upon the consideration of many circumstan∣ces, I can conclude nothing else, but that this defeat and overthrow was for the most part over∣seene, and proceeded out of a meere ambition, because he had under his command good old beaten souldiers, and Field-marshall <HI>Hatsfeld</HI> with
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>his Troops was not above a dayes marching from him, with whom he should have joyned. Without this overthrow we had been masters in the field every where, but God intended to visit and humble us. Upon the receipt of this unplea∣sant news, Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold William</HI> was con∣firmed the more in his heroicall resolution, and furthered the marching of the Armies hither∣wards, and against the Swedes, and yesterday ar∣rived hereabouts about Weidel &amp; Tangermund: Whereupon the Swedes hearing of our com∣ming, moved likewise their former quarters, and marched with their maine strength and power towards Saltzwedel, where they ly now. We seek nothing else, but to meet them in these eaven and flat fields, and to force them to a battaile, being confident, that with our Cavallerie, which is in a good case, we shall over-match them, and within three or foure dayes we shall lay a Ship-bridge over the river of Elve, either here or somewhat lower, that in case of necessity we may the better draw the Silesian Armie to us. What further shall passe, I will certifie you by the next.</P>

<PB N="3" REF="4"/>got not onely in the Mill at Leimbach a great store of meale, but also put to the sword by the way many Imperiall souldiers, and made a great hole into the siege.</P>

<P>WIthin these two dayes the King of Den∣marks Camp shall be demolished, and all the Forces drawne off.

<P>FRom Leipsig and Dresden is confirmed, that the Swedes have given a blow to some Im∣periall Regiments, and forced the rest to retire over the river of Elve. From Gothen they

<P>THE Imperiall Armie that lay about Tan∣germund, hath laid a ship-bridge over the river of Elve, over which they are mar∣ched, and intend to come upon the backs of the Swedes, which lye yet in and about Sultzwedel, and have likewise strongly guarded Osterburg, out of which the Imperialists were beaten. Co∣lonel <HI>Goldacker</HI> hath beene commanded abroad with 600. Currassiers, and Colonel <HI>Feduary</HI> with 600. Crabats, which have strugled as far as Stetin and Wismar, and in two severall places lighted upon 300. Swedish horsemen, whereof they slew many, and tooke many prisoners. The Imperiall Ambassador Count of Auersberg appointed for the treaty of peace with the King of France, and the Sweads, is conducted by Generall <HI>Torstensohns</HI> Trumpeter from Wolffenbuttle to Hamborough. The Duke of Luneburg hath cashier'd the Com∣mander in Hieldesheim, because he had made a secret agreement with the Townes-men to suffer no other garrison to come into the said City, but keepe it out by force.</P>

<P>THE tumult in this City is now appeased a∣gain. Doctor <HI>Osterman</HI> with some others is fled away, our Magistrates have imprisoned sixe of the chiefest ring-leaders, which according to their deserts shall be punished soundly, for an ex∣ample to others. The Spaniards have put 600. men more into Gulick, for the re-inforcing of the garrison there. From Mastricht they write that the Spaniards draw together about Piest 1500. horse and 1500. foote, some whereof are passed already by Namur. It is reported that they are to joyne with Field Marshall <HI>Hatzfeld,</HI> and if they doe it, then the States of Holland have given order to some 1000. men of their forces to joyne with the Weymarish. Here is made great preparation for a ship-bridge, over which the Imperialists are to march. The Lorraine troopes are come to this side of the river of Mosel, and have taken their quarters there.</P>

<P>THe French and Weymarish Forces have set already a strong foot into this Country, and they will hardly ever be driven out of it againe, because they strengthen themselves exceedingly. They have taken the Castle of Hulekrath, Lin,
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>and Duyren, wherein they found great store of corne and other provision; and into all places that they take, they put Hessish garrisons. At this in∣stant we receive avisoes, that the Cities of Mun∣ster Eyffel, and Sulch, are likewise surrendred unto the Weymarish; but those of Liege have obtained the neutrality of <HI>Conte de Guebrian,</HI> which levie now 4000. Foot and 1000. Horsemen for the defence of their Country.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD><HI>From the Bishoprick of Collen the</HI> 12.22. <HI>of Feb. and from the Country of Gulick the</HI> 13.23. <HI>of Feb.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HItherto both parties have paid for the win∣ter quarters; and albeit the Duke of New∣burg comforted all the Cities in the country of Gulick, with the neutrality, if so be they doe de∣ny quarters to the Imperialists; yet the said Duke finds himselfe deceived now, for the Weymarish Auditor told the said Duke at Dusseldorp to his face, that they take nothing else but what they can carry along with them, because the King of France knows hitherto of no neutrality with the Country of Gulick, and that therefore now ac∣cording to the custome of war, instead of the Im∣perialists which lay enquartered here last yeare, they have now taken up their quarters, and so they have made themselves masters of the Cities of Gladbach, Dulcken, Dahlen, Grevenbroch, Caster, Berchem, Hambach, and other places, and now they are gone against Duyren, Sulch, Eyskirchen, Munster Eyffel, Sintzig, Romegen,
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>and other places. Yesterday they pillaged the City of Sulch. They find no where any opposi∣tion. In Duyren they have found above 100000. sacks with corne; every where they have found all the Noblemens houses full of provision; it is not to be expressed what bootie they get. From the Castle of Bebber they have carryed away two waggons loaden with plate; They carry all the booty to Wesel, and into the Country of Cleve. Colonel <HI>Rosa</HI> hath his quarter at Duyren and thereabouts; <HI>Tupadell</HI> at Sulch and Munster Eyffel; <HI>Conte de guebrian</HI> at Neus, where the head∣quarter is; they make all places as strong as they can. At this instant we heare that they are mar∣ching now towards Aaken.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD><HI>Collen the</HI> 13.23. <HI>of Feb.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN my former Letter I certified you of the ta∣king of Lin, the Castle of Hulekrath, being ve∣ry strong, and having round about a deep and wide moat, together with thick walls, hath now been besieged these eight dayes by the Weyma∣rish, and five dayes long they battered it with their Canons. This morning we receive avisoes, that it is likewise surrendred. Three dayes agoe, a part of their Armie marched towards Duyren, which was yesterday surrendred in like manner. The City of Sulch they have likewise taken. At Bergerhausen they have got above a thousand horses. At Blatzeim the Boores offered to make opposition, but they fell short: and many of them
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>were slaine. The Weymarish strengthen them∣selves exceedingly. At this instant we receive avisoes, that Munster Eyffel is likewise surren∣dred. In a word, they make themselves masters of the whole Countrey. The other day, Generall Major <HI>Enckefort</HI> went from hence to the Duke of Lorraine to consult with him, and Generall <HI>Beck,</HI> and to see whether a way may be found out to oppose the Weymarish forces, because they give over now all hope of the Bavarian succour.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD><HI>Leipsig the</HI> 12.22. <HI>of Feb.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FRom Magdeburg they write, that the Swedes have taken the strong passage of Osterburg, wherein Colonel <HI>Wolff</HI> lay with five Companies of Dragooners, the most part whereof they put to they sword; and it is said, that onely his Lieutenant Colonel escaped. Whether. Colonel <HI>Wolff</HI> be dead or taken Prisoner, is not knowne as yet: It is certaine, that the Imperiall and Bavarian Armie is passed the river of Elve, and lyes now betwixt the river of Havel and Sprew: It is said, that they intend to march into the Dukedome of Mecklenburg, but they will find but little provision there either for men or horses. The Swedes have surrendred the City of Spern∣berg, pillaged the same, and put some men in it to the sword; and the Lo: <HI>Ulrich Wentzeln</HI> Baron of Biberstein, they took prisoner. From Eysleben they write, that the Castle of Mansfeld is yet stoutly defended by the Swedes.</P>

<P>PAssengers comming from the Swedish head∣quarter at Saltzwedel, confirme the great plot and treacherie that was discovered, which Colonel <HI>Seckendorff</HI> had laid against Generall <HI>Torstenson</HI> and the whole Armie, which he inten∣ded to deliver over unto the Imperialists, for which he was imprisoned, and afterwards his head cut off.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Collen the</HI> 15.25. <HI>of Feb.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUr Magistrates here take yet daily some persons in apprehension: The Imperiall succour which was expected so long, appeares not yet, at which the Bishop of Collen is vexed very much. Hulekrath is surrendred by composi∣tion unto the Weymarish. They have divided their Armie into three parts; One part is gone towards Duyren, the other towards Aaken, and the third over-runs the countrey, and brings in the contribution. The States and Peeres of the Bishoprick of Collen, are going againe towards Neys, to remonstrate, that it is impossible for them to raise in the countrey so great a summe of money, which the Weymarish and Hessish For∣ces demand.</P>
<P>The King of France hath made over by bills of exchange to the Princesse of Hessen, 100000. crowns for the continuation of the war: 23. Hessish
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>Companies of Foot and 12. Companies of Horse are marched through the countie of Bentheim <HI>de gone</HI> to joyne with the Weymarish Forces. 2500. Boores of the country of Gulick have like∣wise joyned with the Weymarish Armie, threat∣ning that they will be revenged of the city of Collen, which as they pretend hath been the undoing of them.</P>
<P>From Amsterdam the 19. of <HI>Feb.</HI> the 1. of <HI>Mar.</HI> they write, that the city of Aaken is likewise sur∣rendred unto the Weymarish. They write also, that with the last ships from Fernamboucque in Brazill, they have news, that the Hollanders since the taking of the Iland of S. Thomee, have like∣wise taken the Iland and City of Maranhaon.</P>
<P>From Paris they write, that the French in Ca∣talonia had some overthrow given them by the Spaniards, and that the King with the new Ar∣mie makes the more haste thitherwards. They write also, that the Cardinal of Savoy is to marry his deceased brothers wife the Dutchesse, and that the said Cardinall hath delivered up to the King of France the strong Sea-port <HI>Nizzade la Paglia.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD><HI>Lower Saxonie the</HI> 9.19. <HI>of Feb.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is certaine, that the Imperiall Armie, toge∣ther with the whole Artillerie, is passed at Tangermund the river of Elve, and the Ship∣bridge was presently thereupon taken up and sent back towards Magdeburg. At this instant we
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>heare, that the Swedes are marching over the Garleber Plaine towards New Haldesleben, which lyes three Dutch miles from Magdeburg, where they intend to keep their randevouz, and then to march farther into the Bishoprick of Halberstat and Arbishoprick of Magdeburg; and this day divers Swedish parties have been seen about New Haldesleben: Whether now the whole Swedish Armie will follow, time will shew.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Magdeburg the</HI> 13.23. <HI>of Feb.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Imperiall Head quarter is now at Lo∣burg, and the Bavarian at Mockeren, three or foure Dutch miles from hence. The Ship∣bridge lyes yet at Rogen, foure Dutch miles from hence; which by reason of the continuall high winds, cannot be brought hither; but the Swedish Armie, we heare, is now going down∣wards. Generall Major <HI>Coningsmarek</HI> with some Regiments of Horse, lyes in and about Garle∣ben; what his designe is, time will shew. The Imperiall Colonel <HI>Goldacker</HI> and Colonel <HI>Feduarii</HI> have beene with 1200. Horsemen in the Duke∣dome of Mackelburg, where they had good suc∣cesse, especially at Wittemberg, where they ob∣tained above 200. sadled horses, with all their furniture, and the horsemen they put to the sword.</P>

<P>HEre in this city daily new forces are levied. Since the taking of Lin and Kempen, the castle of Hulekrath and the city of Duyren is likewise surrendred unto the Weymarish. In a word, they doe yet what they list: Yesterday they were mustered, and they were found above 20000. strong in the field, besides those that they have lying here and there in Garrison. The Lorraine Troops lye yet at Bobers, which are but in a poore case.</P>

<P>ALbeit the King of Denmark hath caused his Camp before this City to be razed and de∣molished, notwithstanding he begins to forme another, and to that end hath sent to Gluckstat for ten Peeces of Ordnance more to be brought unto him. The said King hath likewise commanded, that all mens names throughout all his domini∣ons shall be set downe, to employ them in War by sea and land, whensoever occasion shall re∣quire it, whereof the Magistrates in the Cities have made a beginning already. The Drem∣blinger Boores have taken in unto them 1000. Imperiall Musquetiers, which offer to venture their lives with them.</P>
<P>From the Swedish Camp they write, that Co∣lonel <HI>Seckendorff,</HI> a Franconian Gentleman, had
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>correspondence with the Imperialists, and his plot was to provide a great banquet for the chie∣fest Swedish Commanders, and when they had been soundly drunk, the Imperialists should have falne upon the Swedish Armie, and thus over∣throwne the same, which was discovered by the Trumpeter, whom he had sent with a Letter to the Imperialists; for when he was passing through the Swedish Centrie and Watch, he was questi∣oned, and found inconstant in his speeches; where∣upon a suspition was presently cast upon him, and after that the Letter was found with him, the whole basenesse was discovered, whereupon the aforesaid Colonel <HI>Seckendorff</HI> was laid hold on, and being condemned by the law of Warre, his head was cut off. He intended likewise to revolt with his whole Regiment from the Swedish Ar∣mie, and to come over to the Imperiall Armie. This day the Count of Aversperg arrived here, who shall be employed in the Treaty of Peace. The Swedish Forces are yet resolved to fight. And albeit Generall <HI>Torstenson</HI> is yet very weak, notwitstanding hee doth not omit to give audience, counsell, command, and the like, and followeth the businesse to his utmost abilities.</P>

<P>ABout New Holdesleben, three Dutch miles from Magdebueg, appeare daily strong Swedish parties, and it is not known as yet, whe∣ther the whole Swedish Armie will follow; and if they doe not follow with the whole Armie, yet questionlesse they will command strong parties towards the strong Castle of Mansfeld, to relieve the same: And it is certaine, that the Bavarian Colonel <HI>Wolff,</HI> who lay with 5. companies of Dragooners in Osterburg, was surprised by the Swedes, and all his men were put to the sword, and taken prisoners, insomuch that no more but his Lieutenant Colonel escaped. Whether Colo∣nel <HI>Wolff</HI> himselfe be slaine or taken prisoner, is not yet knowne. The Swedes upon the Castle of Mansfeld defend themselves yet stoutly. 5. dayes agoe, an Officer of Col: <HI>Dracmullers</HI> Regiment was sent into the Castle, which is not yet come back againe: the reason of it is not knowne. And at this instant we receive intelligence, that the Swedish Generall Major <HI>Coningsmureck</HI> is going thitherwards with 8. Regiments of horse, who hath order to relieve the said castle.

The Imperialists upon the perswasion of General Major <HI>Pfuel,</HI> who hath served many years in the Swedish Armie, and is now with Arch-dake <HI>Leo∣pold William,</HI> have been moved to advance thus far against the Swedish Armie, telling them that the same was but weak, starved, and conditioned in such a manner, that if they would now take their advantage, they might easily overthrow and totally extirpate the same: But being that they found his report false, and the said Armie in a good condition and Posture, it is beleeved, that the Imperialists will shortly returne back againe, and the Swedes (being they have received certain intelligence, that the Imperialists are not by far so strong as it was reported, as also that the Ba∣varian Armie by reason of the successefull pro∣gresse of the Weymarish and Hessish Forces, will be drawne off from the Imperiall Armie) march directly against the Imperialists.</P>

Which Letter the Weymarish sent unto the Commander with threatning words, to hang him and all his soul∣diers, if he did make opposition contrary to his Electors order and command: Whereupon he came presently to a composition, and did march out with bag and baggage: but being the Wey∣marish Forces were then likewise marching thi∣therwards, the said Commander with his soul∣diers was perswaded to take pay under the Wey∣marish, and afterwards those in Eyskirchen did the like, whereupon a part of the Armie went to∣wards
