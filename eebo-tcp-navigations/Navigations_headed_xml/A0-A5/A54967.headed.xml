<HEAD>A Plain and Uninterested Reflection Upon the present CASE OF THE <HI>East-India COMPANY,</HI> Under its following Circumstances, <HI>Viz.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. — OF having been established and supported by an Uninterrupted Series of <HI>Royal Charters</HI> of <HI>Incorporation,</HI> from Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and her Princely <HI>Successors,</HI> down to those of his present Majesty; from whom, and from her late Majesty Q. <HI>Mary</HI> of blessed Memory, it received Confirmation, by like <HI>Charters,</HI> in <HI>October</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> 1693, for 21 Years then to come; Whereof more then 16 rest yet unexpired.</P>
<P N="2">II. — Of having had, in Vertue of these their Majesties last <HI>Charters,</HI> few less than 800 New <HI>Adventurers,</HI> incorporated into it; but not without 740000 <HI>l.</HI> first Subscribed, towards the enlarging of its <HI>Stock,</HI> and rendring the <HI>Trade</HI> of it, more extensive, and more beneficial to the Nation.</P>
<P N="3">III. — Of having, notwithstanding these <HI>Grants,</HI> and though in manifest Diminution of their <HI>Rights</HI> thereby, and to the known prejudice of its <HI>Trade,</HI> submitted with all Alacrity, to a later <HI>Charter</HI> of <HI>Regulations</HI> in 1694, by which it is in particular made dissolvible upon its appearing to the King, <HI>not to be profitable to him, or this his Realm;</HI> but yet not till <HI>after</HI> three <HI>Years Warning first given it, under his Privy Seal or Sign Manual.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. — Of the Unspeakable <HI>Charge,</HI> it has undergone in Purchasing the <HI>Freehold</HI> of divers <HI>Forts, Factories, Buildings,</HI> and <HI>Lands</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> for the necessary Carrying on of its <HI>Trade;</HI> besides other immense Sums, in fortifying, building on, and Accommodating to its Service, the Islands of <HI>Bombay</HI> and St. <HI>Helena,</HI> both invested by the <HI>Crown</HI> in the said <HI>Company,</HI> as its perpetual <HI>Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. — Of its like extraordinary and Unavoidable Charge, in the Purchase and For∣tifying of its <HI>Forts</HI> on the <HI>West Coast</HI> of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and <HI>Coast</HI> of <HI>Mallabar,</HI> for the preserva∣tion of its <HI>Pepper-Trade;</HI> as that without which, the same must have been exposed to an obvious hazard of being lost to the <HI>Nation.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. — Of its having (besides the <HI>Publick Benefits,</HI> otherwise arising from these its <HI>Expences,</HI> to the <HI>Nation</HI>'s <HI>Trade</HI> there) acquired to its self a <HI>Standing Income</HI> of <HI>Rents</HI> and other <HI>Duties,</HI> to more than 40000 <HI>l. per Annum;</HI> and that Yearly encreasing.</P>
<P N="7">VII.— Of having, besides its forementioned 740000 <HI>l. Subscription-Mony,</HI> paid up∣wards of 85000 <HI>l.</HI> to the <HI>Crown</HI> for its <HI>Stock,</HI> during the late <HI>War,</HI> over and above its Pro∣portion for the present Year; and 295000 <HI>l.</HI> more for <HI>Customs,</HI> since the <HI>Date</HI> of that <HI>Subscription.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. — Of its having, notwithstanding and besides all these <HI>Burthens</HI> and <HI>Payments,</HI> and particularly that of its <HI>Customs</HI> towards the security of its <HI>Trade;</HI> undergone within the five Years of its present <HI>Charter,</HI> the yet more heavy Calamity of losing 12 Ships, to the <HI>Value</HI> of above a <HI>Million</HI> of <HI>Pounds Sterling</HI> more.</P>
<PB REF="2" MS="y"/>
<P N="9">IX. — Of having from these its losses, joyned to its other <HI>Charges,</HI> been necessitated (for preserving the Remainder of its Unhappy <HI>Stock,</HI> and supporting of its <HI>Trade</HI>) not only to the making further <HI>Advances</HI> of its own, but taking up Considerable <HI>Sums</HI> elsewhere at <HI>Interest,</HI> for which both it and its said <HI>Stock,</HI> stand at this day answerable.</P>
<P N="10">X. — Lastly; Of finding it self no sooner brought within View of enjoying its Share at least, with the rest of his <HI>Majesties Trading Subjects,</HI> in the benefits of <HI>PEACE;</HI> after so great an Over-proportion of Sufferings, from the Calamities of the <HI>WAR;</HI> but that, without the least Default assign'd for it on the part of the <HI>Company,</HI> or regard shewn to the Provision even in that Case made by his <HI>Majesty</HI> himself, in the three Years <HI>Warning: A Project</HI> has been concerted by Persons (<HI>Merchants</HI> and <HI>Others</HI>) not interest∣ed in the said <HI>Company,</HI> for the utter Supplanting it, and gaining to themselves, exclu∣sive of all Others, an immediate Propriety in its <HI>Trade</HI> by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament;</HI> in plain Derogation of his <HI>Majesties Charters;</HI> to the manifest Oppression of the present <HI>Company,</HI> the much greater part of whose present <HI>Members,</HI> have not to this day (from the many forementioned <HI>Charges</HI> and <HI>Losses</HI>) touched one <HI>Penny</HI> of clear <HI>Profit,</HI> from the day of their <HI>Subscription;</HI> and to the Obvious Ruin of Thousands of Others, interested with them in the same.</P>
<P>In which their so Unaccountable Enterprize, should these <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> by the Strength of what they have without any or at most with little Adventure, been gathering from the <HI>Publick,</HI> succeed; to the spoiling the <HI>Company,</HI> of the little which this <HI>Accumulation</HI> of Evils in the Service of the <HI>Publick</HI> has left it, of the <HI>Trade</HI> it has so dearly paid for the sole <HI>Title</HI> to: It seems worthy of every ingenuous Dealer's Reflection: <HI>Viz.</HI></P>

<DIV1 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>REFLECTION:</HEAD>
<P><HI>What degree of</HI> Oppression, Circumvention, <HI>or</HI> Violence <HI>to</HI> Publick Faith <HI>it can be thought to be; that these</HI> Gentlemen <HI>can ever pretend to find fault with: When (as none will now think it impossible) another</HI> Juncture <HI>may arise, wherein</HI> Themselves, <HI>under the best Securities either of</HI> Right <HI>or</HI> Merit, <HI>may be attacked with the same</HI> Irresistable Argument <HI>they now glory, in being able to over-bear the present</HI> Com∣pany <HI>with?</HI></P>
