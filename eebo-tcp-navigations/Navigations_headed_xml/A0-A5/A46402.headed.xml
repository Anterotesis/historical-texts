<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>High and Mightie Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N obedience to your High∣nesses Letter addressed the 30. May 1686. unto the Prae∣sidial Chamber of the East-Indie Companie at Amster∣dam, being pleased to Com∣mand the sayd Companie in relation to your Highnesses Resolution of the same dato, to transmit with the verie first an Information unto a certain Memorial presen∣ted by Mr. Skelton, Envoy Extraordinarie of his Royal Majestie of Great Brittain, unto your Highnesses the second of the said Month, tou∣ching the Businesse of Bantam, and moreover contayning complaints of what passed in the East-Indies at Gamron, Mallabar and Ma∣cassar, with demand of reparation, hereup∣on the Regents (or Directors) of the sayd Companie of this Nation, have with all due
<PB N="6" REF="3"/>respect, this to say: First Concerning the first Point, specifying the businesse of Ban∣tam, that although your Puissant Highnesses may verie well remember al what hath hapned and passed since the Month of May 1683, when first those Clamors and heavie complaints were made by Mr. Chudlie, extraordinarie Envoy, in the Assemblie of your Puissant High∣nesses, and thereupon soon after more fully dilated and deduced by Sr. John Chardin, both <HI>viva voce</HI> and in writing: Neverthelesse assuring our selves that it will not be unacceptable to your Pu. Highnesses, that the sayd Memorial be again som what afresh reiterated, the foresaid Regents of the East-Indie Netherlands Com∣panie wil with permission of your Puis. High∣nesses make a short recital, first of what in the beginning was don here in Holland by Con∣ference and treatises, and also afterward con∣tinued and further Progresse thereof made in England by the L. Ambassador Citters, accor∣ding to the order given him by your Puis. Highnesses, and consequentlie of the procee∣dings held in England by Committies on both sides, and what further was acted in the same, and so com to the Principal Matter, to de∣monstrate as briefly as possiblie may be, how unreasonable and wholie ungrounded those complaints are, which in the beginning were so clamorous, and then will fullie justifie the Goverment of Batavia in their management and proceedings in those affaires.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="3"/>
<P>What Concerns the first, Mr. Chudlie ex∣traordinary Envoy by his Memorial of the 25. May, of the fore-said year 1683, complained to your Puis. Highnesses, that the Govern∣ment of Batavia had in a manner altogether ex∣traordinarie, outragiouslie delt with the En∣glish East-Indie Companie, and by main force driven them out of their ancient place of resi∣dence at Bantham, and that in so strange a manner, that not any one Example (a thing rather to be buried in silence, then related) of the like nature can be produced, and there∣fore requiring that the said Netherlandish Companie should be obliged to draw back their Troupes out of Bantam, reestablish the En∣glish there again, and to make reparation of the losses by them sustayned. But Sr. John Chardin, before mentioned, who by the fore∣said English East-Indie Companie was sent hither in Commission, did somwhat mitigate these complaints, apparently, because they were so horriblie extravagant, and in stead of accusing the Government of Batavia, as if they had driven the English out of Bantam, did content himself to say, that it happened through the suggestion and Counsel of Major St. Mar∣tin, who commanded the Netherlandish Troups at Bantam in Chef, and that it was he that disposed the King to put forth the English out of Bantam, and although all he affirmed was without any proof, but only grounded on a Conjecture, yet that which is to be wondred
<PB N="8" REF="4"/>at is, that he would form a publick Memorial on so slight and weak grounds.</P>
<P>And although the Bewinthebbers were at that time unfurnished with such Elucidation of matters as is requisite, not yet having then any of their Ships returned out of India, and what they knew in the business, was by Letters only sent in English Ships from England, where the said Letters were held up some time, the seals broken and opened, and then afterward handed to the Correspondent of the Netherlan∣dish Company at London, notwithstanding they omitted not according to the knowledge they had attained, to give your Highnesses In∣formations and Answers to their Complaints. Whereupon your Pu. Highnesses having gi∣ven an Answer to the said Chudlie and Char∣din (unto which the English Company in some passages of their Writing do appeal) soon af∣ter with the good liking of your Pu. High∣nesses, a treatie began with the forenamed Chardin and the Netherlandish Companie, and the business was so far avanced, that on both sides a final agreement was assuredly ex∣pected, whereas on a suddaine Mr. Chudlie and Sr. John Chardin pretending to have command and order from their King to put a stop to the business, the foresaid Treatise here was unexpectedly broken of, however was with consent of your Pu. Highnesses, who desired nothing more then to compose and conclude, if possible, this matter in a friend∣ly
<PB N="9" REF="4"/>way, continued in England, whereunto the Lord Ambassador Citters was furnished with full Order and Power both from your Pu. Highnesses, as also from the Companie here: but hereupon the English Hightning their Demands, and as appeared afterward, even in their reply, of which shall be spoken hereafter, they avoued to have other designes, intending to reestablish themselves at Bantam, unto which end in the latter part of the year 1683. they prepared a great Fleet well manned to effect the same; but this their design, as themselves affirm, &amp; complain that they might not put it in execution, as being hindred by the now deceased King, of happy Memorie, hereupon this Treatise was stopt, and no fur∣ther progress made therein until at length, it pleased his said Majesty to make way for the prosecuting of the agreement prescribed Anno 1674. between his Majesty and this State, to wit, that the differences should be determined and composed by Committies on both sides, who to that end according to the foresaid Convention were to assemble together at London, the which being also approved by your Pu. Highnesses, there was erected a Tribunal Court, consistng of eight Committies, four on each part, before whom, after that the Parties on both sides had di∣vers times appeared about the Praeliminaries and cases incident, it was thought meet, that all things should be handled in writing, and
<PB N="10" REF="5"/>the State of the case so written, to be made by Demand, Answer, Reply, and Duplick (or double Reply) even to a Triplick and Quadruplick, and besides all this there were delivered up such pieces probatory as might serve to fortifie and maintain the case on the one hand, with the Confutation of the same on the other hand, they of the Netherlandish Company also making their Demand against the Demand of the English, and delivering the same over by way of reconvention or contrary Demand, for the fraiting of four Ships, where∣with the Netherlandish Companie, upon the earnest Request of the English Companie had accommodated them, amounting to thirteen thousand nine hundred pound Starling. In so much that the foresaid Peeces being delivered to the said Committies to do right therein, the Englsh Commissaries in their vote declared, that it was their opinion and sentence, that in stead of all what was demanded by the En∣glish East-Indie Companie (to wit, not only the recalling of the Netherlandish Troops out of Bantam, and the Territories thereof, but moreover and above to deliver up the Castle and City of Bantam.) The Netherlan∣dish Companie was only bound, to reestablish the said English Company in Bantam, so, and in such wise as was demanded by Monsieur Chardin in the Hague, and to settle all things in state as it was before the Warr, and the Damages and Reconvention (or contrary De∣mands)
<PB N="11" REF="5"/>should be reserved.</P>
<P>But the Committies of this State delivering in their Advice, every one of them in order did understand and declare, that forasmuch as the decision of the case, which must be judicially determined, did depend upon the veritie of Fact, which the English Companie had charged the Netherlandish Companie with, and in special that the said English Companie were by them driven out of Bantam, of which they could not produce the least proof, that there∣fore the said English Companie ought to have their Demand and Conclusion made, and ta∣ken up against the Netherlandish Companie, denyed them: and the said English Companie to be condemned to satisfie the Netherlandish Companie for the Fraighting of the four Ships which they demand by reconvention: by which, because of the cessation of voices, the case being fallen into the terms, which they were in according to the convention of a∣greement of the year 1673/4, must come into the hands of an Arbitrator or Compromissa∣rius, to the chosing of whom by the foresaid agreement the time of a Month was prescribed: but the said Committies for the Decision on both sides, not agreeing, for although the English Companie were plantif in convention, yet the English Commissaries did not propose a Super Arbitrator, so hereby the whole case, according to an Act passed and subscribed on both sides, was left in the hands of his said
<PB N="12" REF="6"/>Majestie and your Highnesses, to be deter∣mined by you, according to the contents of the foresaid Agreemtnt And this is the reason why the said Mr. Skelton, Envoy Extraordi∣nary, made the foresaid Memorial and Address to vour Pu. Highnesses to doe justice in the case to the Subjects of England: Whereupon it must needs fall under Examination, whither the complaints which the English Company have, and still doe make of the business hap∣pened at Bantam, be grounded on such solid Reasons, as to oblige the Netherlandish Com∣panie so to resettle them at Bantam, as they were before the War, (for more then this was before denyed to be due to them, by the En∣glish Commissaries themselves) and that with reparation of Dammages and Interests, which they pretend to have sustained by the Nether∣lands Company. Now to make this case to appear more clearly, forasmuch, as since it was first presented to your Pu. Highnesses by Mr. Chudly Extraordinary Envoy, and after∣ward more amply pressed by Sr. John Char∣din, is now wholy altered, and quite of an∣other face: as also that the Netherlandish Com∣pany hath recovred further proofs for the Con∣futation of what the English Company did bring in, and maintain, therefore it will be necessary to dive somewhat deeper into the matter.</P>
<P>The Case is this, Sulthan Agon, formerly King of Bantam, and Father of the present King now reigning, having resolutions, both
<PB N="13" REF="6"/>in respect of his age, and other considerations to disinvest himself of the Government, and lead a still and private life, he made over his Kingdom to his Eldest Son, retiring himself to Turtiassa, a place of pleasure, about six miles from Bantam, and seated a mile from the Sea, there to spend the residue of his dayes free from publick affaires. His Son seated on the Throne, and having the Government of the Kingdom in his hands, forthwith sent Ambassa∣dors to Batavia (accompanied for the further Splendor with a train of about 300. persons) to give notice to the Government there of his access to the Crown, and also to reniew their ancient Alliance, sending also Ambassadors to England, where they were in such manner re∣ceived, as that those of the East-Indie Com∣pagnie by their Letter to the said King of Ban∣tam in July 1682. written about two years after the yong King was come unto the Crown, say, that such honor was given to his Am∣bassadors, as if they been sent from the grea∣test King or Potentat of the World, adding in the said Letter, that they did with joy un∣derstand, that God Almighty had brought and invested him on the Throne of his Kingdom of Sourosoan, that is, the Kingdom of Ban∣tam, with the good wil of his Father.</P>
<P>And furthermore his Majesty of Great Brit∣tain sent away the said Ambassadors with pre∣sents to the young King their Master, accom∣panied with an honourable Letter to him, all
<PB N="14" REF="7"/>which in the Process is produced, and in which he is stiled the famous and Illustrious Sulthan Abdul Cahar Aba Nasar King and Lord of the said Kingdom of Sourosoan, that is of Ban∣tam, adding moreover, that his Majesty re∣ceived the foresaid Ambassadors with all due respect, according to their Character, and with entire affection, as coming from a Prince, whose Person and Amitie his Majesty declared to have in very high esteem, and unto whom, he judged it necessary to send over his Agent or Envoy, furnished with power from his Maje∣sty, and order from the English Company, for to make a strickter League with the King of Bantam, which testimony and proffer of Alliance was yet further reiterated in another Letter, writ by the foresaid English Company from London the 17. July 1682. also produ∣ced in the Process. By all which then it ap∣peareth undeniably unto all that are impartial; that the present King now ruling was acknow∣ledged both by the King of Great Brittain, and by the English Company, as well in En∣gland as in India, for the lawful Lord and King of the whole Kingdom of Bantam, and as the Successor of his Father.</P>
<P>But forasmuch as the present King in the direction of the affaires of the Kingdom, did not, as it seems, answer the expectation of his Father, nor satisfy the humor of manie of his Subjects, there arose a heavie Civil War in the Kingdom, in which the malcontented
<PB N="15" REF="7"/>entending to cast of the yoke from their neck as they termed it, after they had also drawn the Old King to their partie, who thereupon strengthened himself in Turtiassa (as also the King now reigning did at Bantam) at length by force of armes they made themselves Master of Bantham, and besieged the yong King in his Castle into which he was retired, enten∣ding to bereave him both of his Throne and life, and to set up a yonger Brother in his place: whereupon this King apprehending no other way of deliverance, as having most of the great ones of his Kingdom animated against him, and the Communaltie also his ene∣mies, thought it expedient for him to make known to the General of the Councel of the Netherlandish Companie at Batavia, his miserable State, and that he not onely was to exspect the los of the Crown, but also a most cruel death: the which he signifyed, in most la∣mentable wise, imploring their assistance: but they not judging it convenient in a case of such importance to intrude themselves to unadvised∣ly, did, before they determined any thing in the least about it, conclude to interpose their Mediation betwixt Father and Son, and to that end to send Ambassadors with letters tending to that purpose: But the Father in a most disdaing∣ful manner rejecting the same, without vouch∣safing to return any answer at all to the Govern∣ment of Batavia or their Committies, the said Government did at last resolue, seeing the con∣dition
<PB N="16" REF="8"/>of the Son tending to ruin, as beeing forsaken almost by all, to assist him against the Rebels, and if possible to deliver him out of the miserable estate into which he was brought, which also they did with such successe, that notwithstanding the strong opposition of the Enemie, we Landed our forces, raysed the siege of the Castle in which the King was, and set him again upon his Throne, who there∣uppon both to demonstrate how gratly he was offended with the English, who had assisted his enemies, as also to provide for his own se∣curitie for the future, did without any instiga∣tion of the Netherlandish Companie, command them to leave his countrie and to depart else∣where with their Goods. This then beeing a true Narration of what passed in these affaires, these considerable things do present themsel∣ves to consideration.</P>
<P>First, that the Old King having made over his Kingdom to his eldest Son, he therely be∣came lawful King by his Fathers transport, and was acknowleged so to be, by the King of Great Brittain, and by them of the English East-Indie Companie.</P>
<P>Secondly, that he therely being lawful King, his subjects in taking up arms agaynst him, were Rebels.</P>
<P>Thirdlie, that according to the Law of na∣ture and af nations, it is not onely permitted, to be assistant unto a King, that is oppressed by his subjects, but that such assistance is ap∣prouvable
<PB N="17" REF="8"/>and a Work of Charity and Love.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that it is contrary to the Rule of Justice, to ascribe the evil Consequences of a lawful and worthie Act, unto him that is the Author of the said Act, and not of the con∣sequences.</P>
<P>Fifthly, that it is altogether against reason to impute the Chasing of the English out of Bantam unto them of the Government of Ba∣tavia, and to their auxiliarie Forces, because it is manifest, that the departure of the English out of Bantam was not a necessary, but an ac∣cidental Consequence, the King not causing them to depart because he was victorious (for he had suffered them to live there from the time he came to the Crown until the Warr, to wit, during the two years of his Reign) but only because he was certain they had assisted his Re∣bels, besides many other suspitions he might justly have taken up against them.</P>
<P>But against this, they of the English Com∣pany doe alledge, and depose for a real truth, that they of Batavia had raised and fomented the quarrels between the Old and the Young King of Bantam.</P>
<P>That two yeares before the Warr began they had had secret Negotiations with Pangeran Diepa Panerat, one of the Principal Ministers of the young King, to bring about this their design.</P>
<P>That they afterward having got this King in∣to their snares, and most perfidously brought
<PB N="18" REF="9"/>him under their yoke, forthwith forced him to drive out the English.</P>
<P>And to make the Ministers of the Nether∣landish Company yet the more suspected and stincking to all the world, they undertook in the beginning of the year 1683. to represent unto the King of Great Brittain that the fore∣said Major St. Martin who commanded over the forces of the Netherlandish Company at Bantam in Chef had committed very many Enormities against the Factors, People and the Effects of the English Company at Ban∣tam, so farr that they dispossessed, and drave them out of their place of residence: But in stead that the English Company ought to have proved the Facts which are essential to the thing, in case they herein aimed to triumph, they doe not in the whole product which they made in the Process thereof, so much as alledge the least appearance either directly or indirectly, no not so much as consequentially might serve for the verifying of the Enormities of such Facts.</P>
<P>And although the Netherlandish Compa∣ny might stand upon the Negative, which is not necessary, nay many times possible to be proved, save only indirectly (for no man can in a direct manner prove that which is not) ne∣vertheless to manifest clearly that they of the Government of Batavia are altogether blame∣less, let us onely consider the moral impossibi∣lity of the foresaid Fact, viz. that the Gover∣nors
<PB N="19" REF="9"/>of Batavia should have raised and fomen∣ted the questions and differences between the Father and the Son, as also the notorious false∣hood of the second Fact, namely, that the said Government should have forced the King to cause the English to depart out of Ban∣tam.</P>
<P>What concerns the first, its known to the world, that for a long time, there had been no good intelligence between the Old King and the Government of Batavia, no not so much as to the least Correspondence, for the latter fin∣ding themselves much affronted and injured, in∣somuch that at last they took up Arms against each other, the Warr not ending until the Son came to the Crown, so that they could not stirr up the Son against the Father, muchless foment their quarrel.</P>
<P>And what follie would it have been for them of Batavia, to animate the Father to Warr a∣gainst the Son, forasmuch as they lived with the Son in amitie, and as good Neighbors, not ha∣ving any reason in the least to complain of his Government and conduct towards them, whereas on the contrary if the Father had got the upperhand they should have been in a farr wors condition, and attracted a nieu Enemie a∣gainst themselves.</P>
<P>And that they should have stirred up the Son against the Father, and encouraged him to Warr, cannot be imagined by any that are in their right senses, partly because there by they
<PB N="20" REF="10"/>could not expect any profit or advantage, or if they had, it would have been mixt with an un∣certaintie as to the event, and again the Son would then have endeavoured to have been a∣forehand and the first aggressor, whereas on the contrary it was the Father, who thereby got so great advantage over the Son, burning and ruinating the City, and keeping his said Son besieged in his own Castle, so that, had it not been for the intervention and succours of them of Batavia, the Father certainly would have triumphed over the Son: and put the case the Warr had ended according to the intention and advantage of the Son, what more could he have expected thereby, who already sate on the Throne, and could be no greater then he was, would the Son have listned to such coun∣sel, and engaged in a Warr against his Father, whose Interest consisted in governing his Kingdom in peace? And doth it not hence fol∣low, that all these troubles did arise from them who breathed after nothing more then change? Who not being able or willing to submit to the Government of the young King, revolted against him, with intention to thrust him from his Throne, and to set up another more suitable to their liking and humor? Which their design also so farr succeeded, that the young King was brought to the point of loosing his Grown and Life.</P>
<P>Could the Government of Bantam at the beginning have with any reason imagined, that
<PB N="21" REF="10"/>the young King should finally have got the upperhand over his Enemies and Rebells? or that the English should have intermedled with that Warr, and would have assisted the Rebells against their own Prince, whom themselves owned as lawful King (of which hereafter shall be more largely spoken) and he thereupon should have thrust the English out of his King∣dom?</P>
<P>Would they have stirred up the Son against the Father, after that the Son by so many la∣mentable Letters had implored their assistance, and let it come to that extremity, that in case they had delayed but one day longer, he must have given himself over to his Rebels, and un∣dergon a cruel death?</P>
<P>In case the Rebels (before it was delivered by the Netherlandish forces) had taken the Castle, and murthered the King, could they have hindred, that either the old King or one of his younger Sons should have obtained the Crown, and so managed the affaires of his Kingdom, as to take vengeance of them, that had opposed themselves against his de∣signs.</P>
<P>And if so be in cases of such nature place may be given to conjectures and presumptions, is it not most probable, that the English them∣selves have done that very thing, which they falsly impute to the Netherlandish Company?</P>
<P>They Publish for a certain Truth, that the young King, while the Father as yet governd
<PB N="22" REF="11"/>the Kingdom, assassinated their Agent and Commises, and that he alwayes carried himself as an Enemy to them, whereas on the contrary the Government of the Father was most grate∣ful unto them.</P>
<P>Doth it then seem to be such an ungrounded praesumption, that they (partly to revenge themselves of that Massacre, of which the King of Great Brittain in his Letter to the now King of Bantam declareth himself so sensible) and partly that it was much for their Interest, that the Son might be puld down from the Throne and put to death, and that the Father or another Brother were set up; they should labour to kindle the fire and foment this Warr? Especially hereunto concurring that they were so soon readie to join their forces to the as∣sistance of the Father, without which the Father could not have obtained those advan∣tages, nor the Son been brought to such a Laborinth.</P>
<P>Also it will clearly appear, that all the mischief which is come to the English Compa∣nie in this businest, is wholy from the bad ma∣nagement of affaires by their own Men and Mi∣nisters in Bantam?</P>
<P>For the King of Great Brittain and the En∣glish Companie acknowledge the young King for the alone King and Soverain.</P>
<P>But their Ministers declare him to be an U∣surper and a Rebel of the Father.</P>
<P>Their Masters endeavour to establish a setled peace with him.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="11"/>
<P>They set themselves formally against him as their Enemie.</P>
<P>Their Masters Endeavour to oblige the Son by all means possible, and send great quantitie of all manner of Ammunition of Warr to him.</P>
<P>They do not only disoblige him in all things, but even assist his Enemies with the provision sent to his assistance.</P>
<P>Their Masters in their fore-mentioned Let∣ter, pray that God the Creator of Heaven and Earth, would bless and prosper him.</P>
<P>They endeavour to bereave him of his Throne, and make him the most miserable of men.</P>
<P>So that having by these unrighteouss courses brought upon themselves to be driven out of Bantam, they now known not how to excuse the matter.</P>
<P>And being disappointed in their design, as fallen into the pit they digged for others, they are at their wits End and know not what to doe, some bodie must be found out upon whom to lay the blame, and the next that comes to hand is the Netherlandish Companie, <HI>Hic mihi turbat aquas.</HI></P>
<P>But had they sate still, or had (as they would make the world believe) kept themselves neu∣tral, according to the will and footsteps of their Masters, or had they in stead of helping the Old, assisted the young King, these diffi∣culties nor questions had never happened.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="12"/>
<P>And how can the English with any shew of reason dispute or call in question the Soverainty of the young King, seeing it is a known case, that the sending and admitting of Ambassadors and Agents, together with the making of Treaties and Alliances, are true tokens of a Soveraign power, and therefore all such as ad∣mit and receive Ambassies, do thereby acknow∣ledge the Soverainity of them that send the same, which is also further owned by proffers of Alliances and Leagues, which cannot be erected but between Soveraigns.</P>
<P>Now as to the second Fact; to wit, that after the Netherlandish Company had got the young into their snares and perfidiously brought him under their yoke, they then should have forced him to the expulsion of the English, This we have before manifested to be a false fiction: For first they ought not in a case of so great weight and tendency make such odious and malitious positions, except they had clear and convincing proofs at hand: There is not any one of the Witnesses, which the English Companie have produced, that mentions a word thereof, or that speakes of snares in∣to which they of Batavia caused the young King to fall, or of any yoke under which, against all fidelity, they had brought him.</P>
<P>It is true, they produce in the Process one Mr. Waite, speaking of the departure of the English by order of the King, who relates onely of an hard contest between the said
<PB N="25" REF="12"/>King and Major Sr. Martin, before that or∣der of causing them to depart, could be ob∣tained from him; but being, saith he, alto∣gether under the power of the Hollanders, he was necessitated thereunto, but besides what might be alledged to weaken this asser∣tion, he confesseth, that what he witnesseth thereof is not of his own knowledge, but that he believeth it to be true upon the cre∣dit of persons of worth, which of it self is enough to reject the same, as also it is very observable what on this subject the foresaid Sr. Martin and others with him doe declare: to wit, that the Contest was not to dispose the King to the ejection of the English, but to turn away the wrath and indignation of the King (which because of their assi∣stance of his Father and the Rebels, he had taken up against them) and thereby to deliver them from the loss of all their Goods yea life it self, as out of revenge he had determined against them, which also was so taken and acknowledged by the English Compagny at Bantam, when by their Agent they returned thanks unto the Ministers of the Netherlan∣dish Companie for their protexion. But sup∣pose the King had not been so incensed a∣gainst them, as hath been said, and that he had not had design at all to be avenged on them, yet the mere consideration of his se∣curity might have moved him to their ejection, as beeing assured they assisted his Rebels, and
<PB N="26" REF="13"/>in apprehension, that they as wel versed in warkely affaires might from England or Else∣where reenforce themselves with ships and Sol∣diers, besides the Perillous neighbourhood of their warehouse to his Castle, his Father laying round about Bantam with his armie, and keeping it yet for som moneths besieged, and he as yet by his auxiliarie forces having onely the sea open, might if he were not verie circumspect, bee again suddenly assaulted, or at least, the English remayning in Bantam by spying all opportunities, make discoveries to the enemies, so as in way of providence it was requisite for him to do what he did.</P>
<P>If the Letters, (brought in the Processe) be reviewed, it wil appear, whither it be true, as is imputed to them, that they of their own mo∣tion did send succours to the said King, yea so as thereby (if their most injurious aspersion were true) to get him into their Klutches or on the contrarie, that is was don at the Great and instant entreaties of the young King, after that al wayes of reconciliation had in vain bin attempted.</P>
<P>But forasmuch as this assistance and succour is thus averslie and after so odious a manner de∣claimed, it will be necessaire to relate the same somewhat more fully, and more clearly to dis∣cover the occasion and progresse thereof.</P>
<P>After the Rulers of Batavia had ripely consul∣ted about the constitution of the affaires of the young King, they thought meet, as also hath before bin specified; to proffer their service of
<PB N="27" REF="13"/>Mediation, between the Father and the Son, to which end they wrote two Letters in civil and obliging termes, testifying their purpose and af∣fection in a way of frindship to accommodate and lay by their questions and differences, and with that Intention sent thir Plenepotentiaries with Letters, the one to the Father, and the other to the Son in a Ship prepared to that end, after that som dayes before by way of advance they had also sent three other Ships, but conside∣ring those Plenipotentiaries went unto a place where the parties on both sides were in armes, and not being certain whither they might meet with friends or enemies, they therfore judged themselves obliged to put them into a posture of defence, furnishing them with weapons in case of necessitie to make resistance to sueh, as for∣getting the right of nations (especially in that confused state of things) and the respect that ought to be given to publick Persons, might possiblie attempt to lay hold on and injurie them, and this is that fleet of Ships and Barcks which in these and other of their writings they so much enhance and make a stir about, as sent to Bantam to land our Troupes there.</P>
<P>Our forefayd Plenepotentiaries having way∣ted some time for an answer from the old King, received none, and not knowing what properly the intention of these men might as be to them, sent a good troop of men, to inform themselves more exactly of the State of things: but being a little advanced, they met some Europeans,
<PB N="28" REF="14"/>who by an English Man enquired of them, wherefore they came to intermeddle with the differences of the two Kings? whereuppon being answered, that they came as friends to procure a peace between the Father and the Son, they soon perceyved the design they had formed agaynst them, for forthwith they saw a great troop of men gathered together, ma∣king readie some fire Ships and other vessels fit∣ted for warre, making a shew as if they would fal foule with us, who verilie were to few in number to have thoughts to attempt any thing agaynst so powrful an enemie, who seemed to come agaynst them, which also they did and came to the deed it self, shooting at us, and with their Canons, which were Managed by the En∣glish, they much endammaged our Ships, where∣by they perceived, that they not onely, did not accept of our Mediation, but also that they treated us as enemies: upon which they of Ba∣ravia soon resolved by force of arms to deliver the young King out of this Miserie and the brinke of death, and to this end to send a suffi∣tient power of Ships and Men to this assistance, which also had that successe, as before is men∣tioned.</P>
<P>The assistance which the English gave to the old King, whereby the displeasure and wrath of the young King was so kindled agaynst them, even to their ejection out of his country, is so notoriously known to the world, that be∣sides the proofs which the Netherlandish Com∣Panie
<PB N="29" REF="14"/>have alreadie alledged, they yet further could bring hundreds of convincing testimo∣nies, but let onely the letters of the young King which he sent from his besieged castle to them of Batavia be produced, and you shal hear him complayning in these formal words.</P>
<Q><P><HI>What reason hath the English Captain to help to shoot at me, without once laying to hart that he is resident in my Land and Zea, this is yet worse that Mr. Boyer (one of the English Marchants at Bantam) causes my house to be shot at, not once thinking, that I desired the King of England that he might be Captaine in the English Lodge: Ire∣quest of Capitain Moor Speelman, that he wil warn the English not to com on shore, to shoot at my house, and assist mine enemie also with powder, forasmuch as he hath his residence in my Land, but not in the Land of Sultan Agon (the old King) as also to perswade them not to follow mine enemie, seeing they drink my water and dwel in my Land, and that they close no more with Sultan Agon; if Captain Moor have love for me, let him be pleased forceably to Insinuate this unto the English, that above all things they shoot not at my house, nor betake themselves to Land.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The which also in a following Letter to the Major St. Martin he further confirmed.</P>
<P>Beside the said King did afterward make often Complaints to the whole World, that the En∣glish had given all assistance to his enemies: yea one of the English themselves, relates in a cer∣tain book printed at London, in which he
<PB N="30" REF="15"/>gives an account of what passed at Bantam du∣ring the warre, and of which he was eye-wit∣nesse, viz. that they of the English nation had furnished the old King with most of all the Am∣munition he had, and withal, that they used all means possible to encourage and encense the Javans against the Dutch: and thereupon he con∣cludes, that they (to with the English) had no ground much to rely upon the frienship of the Netherlanders, in case they once came to set foot on land: Notwithstanding they are not asha∣med to deny al this, yea in the Memorial deli∣vered by Mr. Chardin (while he was here) and seconded and further confirmed by a certain Memorial, which the English Companine, to∣gether with their demands, delivered over to the Commissaries, who were to decide on both sides, namely, that the English in all this while, had kept themselves altogether neutral between the said opposing parties, and conclude from thence, that the King had not out of his motion caused them to depart, but thro the Instigation of the Major St. Martin (a thing most notori∣ous false) as at the beginning they clamoured and published to the whole world, namely that we drave them out with force, after a most barbarous and unheard of manner.</P>
<P>So then it appeares on both sides that their de∣parture was caused by the Kings order, who only hath powr of Command in his country, and whose command they were bound to obey: But it is denyed, and there is reason to protest
<PB N="31" REF="15"/>against Injurie don us, as if we had bin the effe∣cters of the same. Ought not then the English to prove that fact? undoubtedly yea; but have they any proof thereof? certainly non at al. Can the English Satisfy with this, that in stead of proof they onely produce obscure, suspicious discourses to which no credit wil be given▪ save only by such as are praeoccupied, and readie to take, whatever may serve to feed and streng then an anticipated humour.</P>
<P>They remonstrate, that in a certain hearing, which the King of Bantam granted them soon after the obtained Victorie; they could not per∣ceive the least distemper, or Indignation, but that indeed there were some hot words passed between the King and Sr. Martin: But, I pray, is this a proof to convince as to a crime, espe∣cially of such nature as this? We neither may nor can rely upon the gesture and countenance of any, muchless of a King, especially of an Indian Prince, who seeks to keep in his wrath and indignation, and to take his best opportu∣nity to avenge himself: Is there any one that ever heard that Major Sr. Martin instigated the King to chase the English? Is there any thing produced in the least tending thereto? Certainly nothing: on the contrarie the said Sr. Martin as a Man of honor, a Gentleman of qualitie, and surpassing modestie, wisdom and learning, wholie takes of all sinister suspition, in protesting that the intercourse with the King was entended to no other end, then to divert and take of the
<PB N="32" REF="16"/>King from the design he had to destroy all the English, and should he not to doe so, have had much more reason, then, as the English Com∣panie in their Demand given in against the Netherlandish Companie, and more amply in their Reply doe assert, that he some years be∣fore had caused the Agent of the English Com∣panie to be murthered, together with their Co∣mises, of which they afterwards made such heavie complaints, yet nothing followed there∣upon: Is it then to be wondred at, that he was so greatly incensed because of this their action, that except he had forceablie bin diswaded by Sr. Martin, he had caused them all to be slain? They endeavour also to make the Netherlandish Companie or their Ministers suspected to have an hand, likewise in this Action, but they are ne∣cessitated to protest against this outragious in∣jurie and Calumnie, They who at the same time were so highly out of favour with the old King then reigning, would certainly be far from having an hand in so horrible a Murther, by which they could not in any respect be ad∣vantaged: If that William Kaef the Nether∣landish Resident at Bantam, when the Old King overthrew and saccaged the Citie, was fain for to escape massacring, to retire to Ba∣tavia leaving all the Goods and Effects of the Netherlandish Compagnie in their Lodge, which undoubtedly was by some English, though perhaps without the knowledge of their Masters in part stolen: should not then
<PB N="33" REF="16"/>the English, had they not in that furie been pro∣tected by the Netherlandish forces, have been in far greater danger? Would there have bin any appearance for any of them to have escaped with their lives? And nevertheless according to their saying, It is the Dutch that caused all these Troubles and Mischiefs to befal them. But the English were not then of that opinion, nor used such kind of Language, when they came so solemnly to declare their thankfulness to the Dutch, for their good will and protection they had shewed to them.</P>
<P>But how little the English Companie doth agree with it self, and how often they are out and in in their writings, doth hereby appear, that in what they have deposed by form of de∣mand, themselves say, that their Agent and the Councel the day after the raising of the Siege, were with the King in his Castle, to take of and appease, if possible, the Chagrin and wrath of the King so hot against them, and that they then found him by far less incensed then the Hollanders said he was: Farthermore in their said Memorial, which they delivered over, together with the foresaid pretences, and to which by the foresaid Demand they adhere, they say, that the same day they were introduced to the King, who laid before them many accusa∣tions, not so much as permitting them to speak a word for their defence.</P>
<P>It followeth then, that whereas they said, when they were brought in before him, they
<PB N="34" REF="17"/>could not in the least perceive in his posture or visage any token of indignation, is a pure un∣truth.</P>
<P>But yet further to convince the English Company of the falsehood of what they im∣pute to the Netherlandish Companie, and that after so odious a manner, it is only needful to look over the Answer of the Netherlandish Companie to the complaints brought in by Mr. Chudley and Sr. John Chardin, in May 1682. whereby the same doth testifie a super-abounding affection and perfect readiness to contribute to all meanes and wayes of reesta∣blishing of the English Company there, by em∣ploying their Credit and Authoritie with the present King, as also to reconcile the two contending parties, according to a <HI>Medium</HI> therein proposed, and so consequently to re∣cal our Troups out of the Kingdom of Ban∣tam.</P>
<P>Now it can easily be conceived, they would not have done all this, in case that by their meanes that Warr had been raised, or that they had had an hand in the chasing of the En∣glish, or had caused the same, muchless if it had been true, as is malitiously imputed to them, that for many yeares since they had plot∣ted, for to draw, and by that meanes to engrosse the whole Pepper-Trade unto them∣selves, and that as they affirm, to the inesti∣mable dammage of the English Compagnie, of which shall be further spoken hereafter.
<PB N="35" REF="17"/>And seeing then it is a false Fiction, that the Dutch Companie should have driven the En∣glish out of Bantam, although perhaps it might have been (which nevertheless was ne∣ver directly nor indirectly attempted) that by suggestion they might have somewhat contri∣buted thereunto; yet hereby also their preten∣ded action of dammage and reparation doth fall of it self.</P>
<P>But that of which also, they have made an hideous cry and tintamar, by an express com∣plaint in their foresaid Memorial, which in May 1683. they presented to your Puiss. Highnesses, and which they more fully dilated afterward, is first, that the day after the deliverance of the King, one James de Roy, Lieutenant of the Companie of Major St. Martin, should have taken down the Flag named the Banner of St. George, planted upon the House of one Captain John Fisher, that the said Fisher thereupon making haste to his House found the said de Roy with a part of the Flag in his hand, having torn the rest, and given it to his Souldiers to make Scarfs of.</P>
<P>Again the said Souldiers had drunk out part of the Drinking-wares, and taken away the re∣mainder together with his houshold-stuff, and withall evilly entreated him, and placed some black Moores in his house.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that five dayes after the departure of the English from Bantam, our Souldiers came into the House of the English Companie,
<PB N="36" REF="18"/>and had sent some Moores (of their Servants) to fetch of the Pavillion that was displaid on their Lodge.</P>
<P>Now suppose all this to be a true storie, and might thereupon give credit at the deposition of one man only, to wit, the foresaid Captain Fisher, and that also in his own case, for fur∣ther Witnesses are not brought for proof of this Fact, yet it is considerable the Actor hier∣of was in service of the King, and not as is ve∣ry abusively said, the Lieutenant of Major Sr. Martin, and consequently the Souldiers were Bantamers: and it is worthie of observation, forasmuch as this Jaques de Roy is so ofsen brought upon the Stage, that he is a person, who somewhile before the Warr, was retired from Batavia to Bantam, for to shun his Cre∣ditors, whom the young King took into his service, who had in and during the Warr sig∣nalized himself by special services, wherefore also he was highly esteemed by the said King, though himself were a man of little worth.</P>
<P>Again, although the foresaid first Flag (for there is mention made of two) might have been the Banner of St. Gerge, yet could it not bring any respect to a private House, and there∣by to be freed from the disorders that in time of Warr are incident, more then to any other House, &amp; what concerns the Banner &amp; use made thereof, is that a thing to cause so much distur∣bance, that a Captain of the King should with his Souldiers take down from a private House
<PB N="37" REF="18"/>the English Flag, after that the King and the whole Nation lookt on him as an Enemie of his Person and of the State?</P>
<P>What concerns the second part, although the relation thereof might perhaps be accord∣ing to trueth, which nevertheless is doubted of, and cannot be prooved, it doth not touch the Dutch Companie, yea though it had been don by their Men: but must be imputed to the disorders in War.</P>
<P>As to the third point, if the recital thereof be according to trueth, and that they sent some of their black Servants to take down the Ban∣ner, which notwithstanding is nothing but a report and recital of some Chineses, this doth nothing to the charging of the Netherlandish Companie, the said Chineses might be de∣manded, how they came to know those Moores were Servants of the Dutch Souldiers and not of the King, as is much more probable, seeing it should be an unusual thing, at least unheard of among us, that simple Souldiers should have Moores to their Servants: but po∣sito that the Dutch Souldiers might have been Executors of the Kings Order therein: the Kings Right is incontestable, and he might take away the Pavillion of the English, after that he had banished them out of his Countrie, yea though the Souldiers had don it without the Order of the King, which is not likely, yet had it been nothing else then a Militarie Inso∣lence, which also must be ascribed to the dis∣orders
<PB N="38" REF="19"/>of War, where the Lawes of Modesty and Deceneie are seldom regarded, and there∣fore without injustice cannot be imputed to them, who in the time of the War at Bantam did represent the Government of Batavia, who never were behinde hand, in that respect which they ow to Crowned Heads; but what need is it to have recours to conjectures, where∣as by a certain produced deposition it is appa∣rent, that it was the King himself who com∣manded the Flag to be taken down from the English Lodge: and what is said of the Dutch Flags which after the Victorie were planted upon the Castle and in other parts of the City, deserves no Answer, since its a known thing that we never pretended any territorial Right in Bantam, muchless put the same in execu∣tion: but however the said Flags served to no other purpose, then to make it known to the Dutch Troupes, who after the raising of the Siege, were posted in the principal places of the City according to the usual practise every where in like occasions. The Flag upon the Castle was set up by order of the King to shew honor to the Dutch, however placed under the Flag of the King.</P>
<P>Besides they of the English Company com∣plain, that the day after the raising of the siege, the Dutch Resident Kaeff with a Troop of Souldiers and some Masons came into the En∣glish Lodge, and ordered the English Agent forthwith to take away the Galeries, and to
<PB N="39" REF="19"/>naile up the Windowe: And that thereupon a Dutch Renegate, who was in his Company, began presently to threaten him, that if the English did not, he himself would do it, which also, as they say, he really did.</P>
<P>This seemeth to be an outragious act don to the English: but if we look into the nature of the thing, it will be found to be a meer trifel, which they ought to be ashamed to urge in this manner:</P>
<P>The Historie is this: Because the Dutch Companie would not be troublesom to any, they chose their own Lodge at Bantam for their Magasin of Arms, and other provisions. Now the Wall of their said Lodge touching part of the English Compagnies dwelling House, and in that said Wall they formerly had had no other opening beside a casement: Somewhile af∣ter the English by permission of the Old King, who let slip no opportunitie to affront &amp; molest them, made great wide windows, to open and shut, and besides that a Gallirie also which hanging four or five foot over the ground of the Hollanders Lodge, gave the English oppor∣tunity to hear and see all what ever the Dutch did: The young King considering that our said Lodge in time of Warr, was like to be the great Magasin, thought it requisite to prevent such dangerous consequences as might be occasioned by overtures, being over a place of the House, where the Powder and other Ammonitions of Warr did lay, and out or through which win∣dows
<PB N="40" REF="20"/>or overtures in the wall, the English at all times might com upon that place, at their pleasure: and knowing the English would not seale up those Windowes, nor suffer the Galli∣ries to be taken away, he thereupon sent his ser∣vants with a Dutch Renegado, to cause it to be don; and it may perhaps be true, that the Resident Kaeff was at that time present, foras∣much as it was don in the said Lodge of the Dutch Companie, where according to his Office he was to take care of the Magasin.</P>
<P>What evil can herein be imputed to the com∣panie, and what accusation can the English frame from this? A thing which way so ever they take it, was carried on by the authoritie of the King, and according to their saying executed by a Re∣negado, the verie naming of whom shews, that he was not in service nor under the Oath of the Netherlandish Companie.</P>
<P>And what besides this they lay to the Charge of the duteh Companie, is, first that they should have taken from the English their horses, and som other things, and have eonstrayned them to take out the Powder that was in their Ships and to bring it a shore.</P>
<P>Secondly, that what they, at the command of the King to depart, in al haste had laden in their boats to bring aboard their Ships, in which neyther the people of the Countrie, nor the Sol∣diers did any wayes hinder them, but passing by the English Chalops which kept the watch at sea, they were by them arrested, under pre∣tence,
<PB N="41" REF="20"/>they had order to suffer nothing to be car∣ried aboard the English Ships, and in case they persisted to do it they should be shot at, by which they should have bin necessitated to return to Land with their Boats.</P>
<P>Thirdly that they complaying of such vio∣lence to Major St. Martin, he in a jesting way should answer, that al was don by order from the King, whereas no man on Land, Soldier or others had a hand in those Violences, but all was don by our Soldiers onely.</P>
<P>Forthly, that the Chief of the French requi∣ring of the King restitution of four Chists with Silver which was taken from him, the King should answer in the presence of the Dutch Commissarie, that he knew nothing thereof, and that he would do no injurie neither to them, nor to the English, Danes, or other Stran∣gers trafficking in his Countrie, and in case any wrong had bin don unto him, since the Hollan∣ders had set foot on Land, that he must require reparation from the Duth Commissarie, or the General at Batavia.</P>
<P>Fiftly, that at the last instance made, to cause the English to quit Bantam, being, as they say, the day before their departure, our Soldiers came into the English Lodge, robbed the Cham∣bers, and took away all they found there; where∣upon the people of the country (so far were they from doing them the least wrong) permitted them to seal up their Magasin and undertook to keep it safe for them.</P>
<PB N="42" REF="21"/>
<P>What Concerns the first point, sorasmuch as they do not onely not say, much lesse prove, that our men should have taken the horses and and other goods from the English, nor that they should have constrained them to fetch their powder out their Ships, therefore the Nether∣landish Companie wil passe that by, as a thing which doth not concern them, and of which they are wholy discharged by the often fore∣mentioned Memorial annexed to the demand or pretense which the English Companie deposed and delivered in, and to which they do referre themselves, in which is expressely said, that Pagoran Diepa Panerat, one of the principal Ministers of the young King, or rather the first Minister of State, had don the same, although they put it in such General and ambiguous ex∣pressions, in all appearence, as if they would lay it to the Charge of our Men: Onely what concerns the Powder, the Dutch companie doth say, that in case it were true, that the English were fain by the order of the King to unlade the same and bring it to Land, that it was don not because the King stood in need of it, for he was abundantly furnished by them of Batavia, but only to prevent that they might not deliver the same to his enemies, and besides it cannot be ill taken, that the King in that confused state of things, would oppose and hinder the English from going so often too and fro to their Ships.</P>
<P>Concerning the second point, namely that
<PB N="43" REF="21"/>we should have hindred the English from de∣parting out of Bantam, and also to have stop∣ped their boats, hath not the least appearance of truth in it, forasmuch as themselves con∣fesse, that we assisted them with our Boats and Chalops to carrie their goods and wares a bord their Ships, when none of the people of the countrie, or their Boats could be obtained to be serviceable to them therein, so little accep∣tance they had with that Nation, and how can this hang together, that we should have procu∣red their departure from the King, and then when they were readie to depart, to hinder it, yea the English disagree in the verie position laid down about it, for their foresaid Memoriall, to which by their demand, they refer themselves, dictates not that their men were stopt at Sea by our Barks that kept watch, but that it was don by the watch of the Netherlandish Companie on Land at the mouth of the haven, to wit, as ha∣ving order to suffer nothing to be carried from Land to the English Ships.</P>
<P>The complaints which thereupon they should have made to Major St. Martin comprehended in the third point, as if he had in a kind of mock∣age, answered them, that all was don by or∣der of the King, what doth this make to the thing? for put the case the said Major (which not withstanding is not granted) might say, not in way of Mockage, but in earnest, that it was to be imputed to the order of the King, which goes farther, if those orders had bin executed by our
<PB N="44" REF="22"/>Soldiers, although that also is denyed, and of which the English doe produce no proofs, yet could it not any wayes prejudice the Dutch Companie as not being bound to be responsable for the Orders of the King.</P>
<P>Touching the Kings answer to the Chief of the French his complaint, and that the King remitted him as to that matter to Batavia, of which is spoken in the forth point, although it should be al true, which notwithstanding is not proeved, it might be that the King did it in such a manner to free himself from the trouble of those complaints, as wel knowing that one of his Ministers had ceased on the said Chefts with silver, which however it be, neither concerns the English, nor obligeth the Dutch Companie to be answerable for the same.</P>
<P>But to demonstrate yet more fully how far the English Companie in all their pretences do aberre from the truth, they say, as may be seen, in the proposall of the first point, that the peo∣ple of the Countrie, to wit, of Bantam, the day before they, viz. the English were caused to remove, did indeed com into their Lodge, but without doing of them the least Injurie, and yet they say in their foresaid Memorial anexed to their Demand, that at the same time they took away all their provision driving the English out of the Chambers (except one named, Waite) and took possession thereof; but a little after the Dutch Soldiers came who further made spoil, and carried away al they found there: But this
<PB N="45" REF="22"/>can not be: because the English had a day be∣fore their departure carried away for Batavia in the Ships of the Dutch Company all their Moveables, to the very least thing of any worth (their departure, as themselves say, being the 12. of April) and so nothing could be found: and besides all the time of their inhabiting of Batavia. which dured more then a year, they never brought in any complaints, by a List or other way shewing, what the Dutch Souldiers had rob'd them of, but on the contrary they came and rendred their thancks to the Govern∣ment there, for all the assistance had been don unto them, without the least mention of wrong received: which had they don, the Go∣vernment there might forthwith have caused enquirie to be made, and if it had been true, procured satisfaction; but letting that occa∣sion slip, and being negligent therein, and then to bring in their Complaints hier, and that without any proof, the Dutch say is a thing al∣together unreasonable.</P>
<P>As hath before been alledged, the English Compagny from the beginning hath pretended reestablishment at Bantam from the Dutch Companie, and to which in their Demand or Memorial of their pretences delivered over to the Commissaries of both sides, they remain persisting, with request that the same may in the first place before all other things be deba∣ted and determined, taking for their founda∣tion, that that reestablishment had alreadie bin
<PB N="46" REF="23"/>accorded and agreed to by you Pu. Highnesses and by the Netherlandish Company.</P>
<P>But now not yet content with that, they praetend by their foresaid Demand besides the recalling of the Dutch Troops, the delivering over the Castle of Bantam in its entire, for to put into it a strong Garrison, pretending that otherwise they would not be willing to settle themselves again there, yea they require that the whole Citie be delivered up, and put into the hands of his Majesty of Great Brittain.</P>
<P>What concerns the first, it is true indeed that the English Company did pretend all this, but it is evident, that the Dutch Company hath as little right to this, as to give over the whole City with the Castle, according to their fur∣ther pretence: We who have only a simple re∣sidence, without participation of any Autho∣rity, which doth wholie reside in the person of the King, it is for us a moral impossibility to dispose of that which <HI>Privative</HI> doth belong to the King, and so to reestablish the English there against his will without intrusion into his right, and violating his Authority: for al∣though the Dutch Company hath their Troops in Bantam which serve the King for a Gar∣rison to defend his City, yet that affords them no Territorial right, nor the least power to bring in again those whom he hath banished from thence.</P>
<P>And as they cannot by force of Arms oblige the King to take in again the English, and re∣settle
<PB N="47" REF="23"/>them in Bantam without usurping upon the Right of Nations, and deservedly to in∣curre the disaffection and hatred of all the Princes and Potentates of Indie, so can they with as little ground do it by threatnings, with∣out injurie to their fidelity, which must be the stay of the credit of the said Companie among the Indian People, who otherwise would not rely upon their word, nor enter into Alliances, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd combinations with them.</P>
<P>But they of the English Company averre, that herein not only consists their interest, but they have also the promise of your Pui. High∣nesses, they onely requiring the Execution of the same.</P>
<P>As to their Interest the Dutch Company will easilie grant, that the foresaid reestablish∣ment might be for their advantage (although they, as hath before bin said, declare that ex∣cept they have a Garrison, and the Castle for their security they would not reside there) so al∣so undoubtedly it would be for their interest, if the Dutch Company did admit them into those Countries, where we have our spices, and which we possess by propriety, with seclusion of all others: and so also it would be for the interest of this State and the Inhabitants there∣of, that the English would permit them the Na∣vigation and trade in the Barbados, Caribes, New-England, the Virgines, and many other Countries they possess in America, where they will not suffer us, nor other Nations of Eu∣rope
<PB N="48" REF="24"/>so much as to pass their Seas. But the Question in this case is not, the convenience or Interest but the Right. If that the English Company could groundedlie maintain, that the Dutch Company is bound to resettle them there, and prove it by cleare and convincing reasons that they had driven them out of Ban∣tam, the business were at an end.</P>
<P>But to come to their second ground, viz. the promise of your Pui. Highnesses, and of the Dutch Company, which was made to them Anno 1683▪ that they should be resetled there: To this we have before said, and do now again answer, that those Proffers do serve for an un∣deniable proof, that the Dutch Companie sought nothing more then to continue with the English Company in an intimate Friendship and Confidence, which by that accident at Ban∣tam did seem in some measure to be interrup∣ted, and that they would rather decline the ad∣vantages which by such excessive expences they had acquired there, then to remain continually in contention and quarrel with the English Company: and hereby the Dutch Company oblitterate those aspensions and calumnies im∣puted unto them, as if in all appearance they for their own Interest and wilfully had incited and fomented the Differences, and warr that followed thereupon, between the Father and the Son, and had two yeares before formed that design by corresponding with Pangoran Diepa Nagara, and so contrived the banishing of the
<PB N="49" REF="24"/>English out of Bantam: For if all this had bin true, they should verie badly have managed their business, after that all was thus succeeded, and they with such excessive charges attained what they aimed at, they should then without any pressing necessitie have made so little ac∣count of it, and that for the mere pleasure of them, who for all the pretences, and justifi∣cation of their complaints made, had nothing to shew in way of proof: Indeed had the En∣glish Company, at that time rested satisfyed, the Dutch Companie should have been obli∣ged to perform the same, how praejudiciable soever it might afterward have been to them: But forasmuch as the English Company was then pleased wholie to reject and break of those transactions, whereas we so desirously longed that they might be brought to a good end in England, and for which, as is said, the Lord Ambassador Citters was fully authorised, al the time that business of Bantam was in the termes, as they were, during the Negotia∣tions, and treatie with Mr. Chudly and Sr. John Chardin in the Hague, and which the English Company also caused to be broken of: where∣upon it fals now to be enquired into, whi∣ther the Dutch Companie, since the case of things be wholie changed and of an other nature, be still obliged to the same.</P>
<P>It is evident that at that time the State of the affaires of Bantam was not known, na∣mely, whither the warr between the Father
<PB N="50" REF="25"/>and the Son were yet remaining, or ended; if it were determined, whither by an accom∣modation or by the Sword: If by the Sword, who of the two, the Father, or Son, re∣mained Conqueror, and thereby become ma∣ster of the Kingdom: During which uncer∣taintie, it can not be judged imprudencie, that the Netherlandish East-Indie Company (by whose forces the Son was delivered from his inevitable ruin, and by whom he further was to be assisted, so as not to fall under the oppression of his rebellious Subjects) should interpose their credit and authority by the said King for the setling of the En∣glish in Bantam, if he were Conqueror, and with condition the English should yield no further assistance to the Father: and in case the Father were Victor, that then the En∣glish should imploy all their credit by the Father, that the Dutch Company might en∣joy a good Neighborhood with them: and these Proffers of the Dutch Companie, while things stood thus at an uncertaintie, were the more excusable by the King of Bantam, be∣cause they endeavoured thereby to prevent the succours which the English Company pretended to send the Father, and also be∣cause at that time it was not yet known, how far the English had made themselves irrecon∣cilable to him.</P>
<P>During this uncertaintie of things, the Dutch Companie made these Proffers, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="51" REF="25"/>Sr. John Chardin himself projected an accom∣modation between both the Companies, in which mention was made of the withdrawing of the Dutch Troopes out of Bantam, and what each Companie should be obliged unto in those occasional accidents, as are thereby specifyed: But as it pleased the said Mr. Chudly and Sr. John Chardin very unexspectedly to break of those treatises, which already were so far advanced, and they also of the English Com∣pany on their part did reject the Proffers, which not only your Puis: Highnesses in their foresaid Answer to the Memorial of Sr. John Chardin, had made: But those also, which the Ambassa∣dor Citters afterwatds did make, in the name and upon the account of the Netherlan∣dish Companie, after that the foresaid Sr. John Chardin was returned into England, and the English began again to bring in new Demands, after they had very disdaingfully rejected the former, hereupon the Netherlandish Compa∣ny judged, that they stood no longer bound to theirs, especially when as somewhile after by tydings on both sides in Letters from the Indies it was signifyed, that the Warr at Bantam was ended to the advantage of the young King, who reobtained the Kingdom as possessor, had taken the Father prisoner and subdued his Rebels, so that consequently the Netherlandish Company had now no longer any ground nor pretext, either to treat with the English about their resetling in Bantam, as beeing, <HI>Territorium
<PB N="52" REF="26"/>plane alienum,</HI> muchless to promise the same, and the rather because the now reigning King having considered the conspiracies of the En∣glish with his Father and rebellious Subjects, hath declared them his pernicious Enemies.</P>
<P>Seeing then from all what hath been said, it clearly appeareth, that the English Companie did rather chose to expect the uncertain Lot of Warr, then to agree with the Dutch Com∣pany, while it was time, about their Set∣lement, it is therefore reasonable that they now acquiesce, and leave the Netherlandish Company unmolested, as to their reestablish∣ment.</P>
<P>It followeth therefore, that it is wholy be∣sides the purpose, at present to make use, or apply to their advantage the foresayd answer of your Pu: Highnesses to the foresaid Memorial, after they had rejected the foresaid Proffer, and had determined not onely to reestablish them∣selves by force of Arms, but wholie to becom the Masters of Bantam, and to that end to set out a formidable Power of ships and Men at sea, though their Entreprize, as they them∣selves depose in their foresaid reply, was stopt by his Majesty of happie Memorie, &amp; not suffe∣red to put forth to sea: now this was the reason that they having formed &amp; being busie about this design, that the Charges thereof might not be fruitlesse, did not only reject the Proffers a foresayd, of the Dutch Companie, but made such Excessive Extravagant demands, as
<PB N="53" REF="26"/>the delivering up of the whole Citie of Bantam with the Castle, although they wel knew that it neither would nor could bee accepted of us, or in case they were accepted, that then they had attaind to what they aymed.</P>
<P>So long then as the State of things was at an uncertaintie, and it might be in doubt who of the twain father or son should have the upper∣hand, though the sonne seemd by far more like∣ly to prevail, neverthelesse the Netherlands Companie judged, that in such a Constitution of things, it could not be il taken that they en∣tred with the English Companie into a treatic, how they might after the best way procure a peace between the two Kings, by interposing their credit and service of love, &amp; obtain the reestablishment of the English Companie; but al this being rejected by the English with disdaing, and that uncertaintie which then was, beeing brought to a Certaintie, so as the whole busi∣nesse is becom of quite another Nature, that the Netherlandish Companie should yet be bound to perform, what they in the uncertain state of things did shew themself willing un∣to, the Netherlandish Companie apprehen∣deth, that it in justice cannot be required. For first thereby, besides other considerations, they should certainly be made loosers of the sum of six times hundred thousand Ryxdallers, which the King of Bantam by evening acounts is found endebted to the Dutch Companie, and of which a Contract is made with him in par∣ticular,
<PB N="54" REF="27"/>in which he grants to their Company the Traffick in his Kingdom, so long and until, he shall come to be in a condition to repay the same to the Dutch Company: But that which besides this deserves to be reflected upon, is, that the King of Bantam hearing a rumour that the English Company persisted in their pretence of resettlement in Bantam, with the calling back of our Troopes thence, wrote to the Government of Batavia (even after he had surmounted al difficulties) that in case they should consent therein, and withdraw our Militia from thence, he should not be able to continue master in the work, but be necessita∣ted to retire to Batavia, in hope protection should not there be refused him, and thereup∣on besought in all humility, that they would at no hand forsake, and reduce him to such ex∣tremities, but perform their word given him by solemn Contract. And how should the Ne∣therlandish Companie be officious to their re∣admission, seeing the English Company in their writings do so scandalously decipher him, as namely, <HI>that he hath with the approbation of all the world acted against the English Nation as an Enemie, so unthanckful, so barbarous, with such antipathie from their Blood, without any the least reason or provocation: that his Majesty of Great Brittain without injurie to his honour, may not rest till he have secured himself of that City and whole Kingdom, until he have got reparation, and that the sooner, because he is, according to
<PB N="55" REF="27"/>their saying, however he bear the title of King nothing else but a perfect Slave of Batavia, and a Servant to their will and pleasure.</HI> High words indeed: also it is a wonderful Dilemma of the English Companie, to wit, if the Old King of Bantam have any right to Bantam, and the de∣pendencies thereof, then the conclusion is most solid, that the same is devolved upon the de∣ceased King of Great Brittain, of happy Memo∣rie: And if the right appertains to the young King, as the Hollanders affirm, then he hath acted by the approbation of the whole World, against the Subjects of his said Maj. as an enemie, &amp; according to what they have deciphred him.</P>
<P>Concerning the first member of this Dilem∣ma, being it is evident, that the Old King of Bantam having given over his Kingdom to his Eldest Son the present inheritor thereof, he now cannot afterward give it to another: the conclusion that follows hence is directly against the English Company. What concerns the se∣cond part of the Dilemma, if it be the young King to whom this right doth belong, and and that it be true, that he had acted against the English as an enemy ungrateful, barba∣rous, and with antipathie to their blood, with∣out the least provocation, as indeed may be drawn, but nevertheless not to justifie the De∣mand of the English Company against them of Holland, neither can any thing therefrom be concluded against the present King of Bantam, in case he hath justly, as he affirmeth, testifyed
<PB N="56" REF="28"/>his displeasure against the English: But in the mean while we cannot let pass, without ta∣king notice that while they are pleased to heap up reproches upon the young King, then they say; <HI>he had acted against the Subjects of his Ma∣jesty as an enemie, ungrateful, barbarous, with an Antipathie of their Blood, without the least provocation,</HI> further, that he is unworthy of alliance with them; but when the business is, to load the Dutch, and make them the Authors of their expulsion out of Bantam, then they alter their strain, and say, <HI>that they could not so much as observe neither in the words or gesture of the King the least thing manifesting any displea∣sure against the English, or that he had a design to make them depart out of his Connirie.</HI></P>
<P>Here, they name the present King a <HI>Slave of the Netherlandish Companie,</HI> and in their Reply they say, that <HI>the Old King, when he sate on his Throne, would willingly have been a Slave of the King of England, and thereof would have made his triumph.</HI></P>
<P>In their Reply they give the mentioned King the name of a <HI>pauvre Idiot,</HI> a vile per∣son, <HI>une Chetive Creature,</HI> &amp;c. And in their let∣ter they wrote to him in March 1683. they styl him a <HI>wise King,</HI> to whom they say, they will send a person with the Title of <HI>Envoy</HI> or <HI>Extraordinary Ambassador,</HI> with full power to conclude an everduring League and Alliance with him.</P>
<P>The same Title the King of Great Brittain
<PB N="57" REF="28"/>giveth him in his fore mentioned Letter, sti∣ling him a <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>righteouss Prince.</HI></P>
<P>On the contraire, the English Companie in their Triplick, call him <HI>a Murtherer,</HI> and <HI>Con∣temner of the publick faith.</HI></P>
<P>And how odiously the English Companie in their foresaid Letter (annexing also, what they wrote to Pangoran Diepa Penerat, Chief Mi∣nister of State) have deciphred the Nether∣landish Companie, and in what esteem we were alreadie with them, even before the Warr of Bantam was kindled, the Dutch Companie will referre to the judgment of the Reader.</P>
<P>It hath already been mentioned, that the English Companie in their foresaid Demand did pretend, besides the calling back of the Dutch Troopes, the deliverie also of the whole Citie and Castle of Bantam, or else as they said they would not make their residence there again.</P>
<P>But besides that the English Commissaries, who were to decide the differences, did as hath been said, Judge, that this their demand, as altogether ungrounded and unreasonable, ought to be denyed, so it is a thing that doth sufficient∣ly refute it self.</P>
<P>For before the Warr of Bantam the English Companie had nothing there but a Lodge and simple Residence, without the least Territo∣rial right: The King after he had triumphed over his Enemies, knowing that they had afford∣ed all manner of assistance to them, and not being
<PB N="58" REF="29"/>at rest as fearing their future miscarriage, and especially in this juncture of time, while he was yet surroundred of Enemies, causes them to dislodge: Hereupon now the English Compa∣nie comes and demands the deliverie of the whole City and Castle, having had nothing there, but as hath been said, a Lodge for Com∣merce, and this they will have from the Ne∣therlandish Companie, who have no right at all to dispose thereof, except they chase away the King that now is, out of Bantam, for to put it into the hands of the English, and ex∣cept they could make it out, and to be agreable to justice, that the Dutch Companie should threaten the present King to abandon and de∣liver him over to the will and mercie of his Enemies, by remouving of their Troopes out of his Citie, whereas we are bound by Con∣tract to maintain and protect him, should now falter in our word, and falselie our trust, a thing which may nor ought to be required of us.</P>
<P>But it is said, that the Dutch Companies in∣tent in this, is to monopolise all the trade of Pepper, and get it to themselves wholie, and to this they ad, that seeing the Netherlandish Companie having besides the trade of Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace and cinnamon, al this would make them able to maintain a fleet to withstand the mightiest King in Europe.</P>
<P>But besides that there are so many other great countries in the Indies, where Pepper may be
<PB N="59" REF="29"/>had, and to which the English Companie have acces as wel as the Dutch, and that it is im∣possible, the Netherlandish Company should get them all under their power &amp; command, it ought to be called to mind, that when we were in trea∣tie here with Sr. John Chardin, that we prof∣fered the Pepper-trade in Common to the En∣glish Companie, and that by the Contract which should be made with the King the half should be allotted them, of which an article was at that time made, and presented in writing, but by the said Sr. John Chardin rejected, so far was it from the Dutch Companies intention to design the same, as its malitiously laid to their charge, and not only as to the Pepper-trade, but they add also in their Triplick, that the aim of the Dutch Company by this their Residence at Bantam, was besides the Pepper to engrosse, to their inestimable profit, the Linnen-Trade also: Whereas on the contrary the Dutch Companie in their foresaid proposals to Sr. John Chardin, beside the Pepper did admit them to the half of all other Wares, including the Linnen, which they also refused, and not∣withstanding in their said Reply they further say, that al the endeavour of the Dutch Com∣panie was whether by right or wrong to keep things in the state to which they had brought them.</P>
<P>The English Company had first set in their Demand they gave in, that by our residence at Bantam we had made the Pepper-Trade more
<PB N="60" REF="30"/>difficult to them, but in their forenamed Re∣ply they say, that we made way to Monopo∣lise the whole, so far may men be blinded by passion.</P>
<P>To what the English Companie doe further depose in their foresaid Demand, viz. that those in pay, of the Dutch Companie, had upon the coast of Mallabar assaulted their Men, given fire on them, and this also to deprive them of the remainder of the Trade in Pepper they as yet had there: The Dutch could have wished, they had more clearly declared themselves as to the place where, the foresaid Coast laying a∣longst the Sea the space of an hundred miles, as also to the year and time when, together to what Ship or Barck and upon what occasion: as on their part the Netherlandish Companie is readie the shew after what manner they delt with our Men upon the West Coast of Suma∣tra, to wit the English Fregat .... in Sep∣tember 1683 being upon the Coast before Ayer Bangi, and sending out his Chaloup with about fourtie armed Souldiers against our men sitting in a Boat, shooting once and again with Bullets: As the Ships the Societie, the Praesi∣dent, the Eagel and Bercklie Castle, who at their return homeward from Bantam, Corman∣del and Bengale, in Iuly and the following Months of the year 1681. overwintering at the Island Mauritius, committed no small insolences and mischiefs, especially they of the Praesident, and Eagel, robbing and carrying away all what
<PB N="61" REF="30"/>they found, notwithstanding all the complaints and protestations made by the people of the Dutch Companie, of which we have authen∣tick evidences in hand to shew.</P>
<P>We pass by, that the English for so many years have made it their constant work, to de∣bauch our men at Bengale, on the Coast of Cormandel, at Bantam, and elsewhere, to draw them out of our service, to serve them on their Ships homeward, (being weakly mand) against the protestations made from time to time, as is to be shewn by evidences in hands of the Ne∣therlandish Companie: That the English Com∣panie is entended, as themselves have divulged, to set down and build a Fortresse on Priamang, seated on the West Coast of Sumatra (a coun∣trie under the command of the Dutch Com∣pany, and where they have a Fort lying) which by the first Letters that come, we ex∣pect to hear that it is already effected, they ha∣ving sent to that end divers Ships, with Men, Materials, and warlike furniture: the mischief that hence will ensue, may easilie be gessed at.</P>
<P>It is a thing inconceivable, how they dare publish to the world, that the Dutch Compa∣nie by a contract made with them of Macasser November Anno 1667, and as they say, printed at Batavia, by which the English Nation was secluded from Commerce in that Countrie, and of which after the expiration of eighteen years, they make complaints in their writings: whereas since that time two solemn Treatises have been made betwixt England and this State,
<PB N="62" REF="31"/>beside the forenamed agreement of the year 167<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by which all pretences and actions what∣soever, which might have been against each other, were nullifyed as if they never had bin, and although this should not be urged, the Dutch Compagnie is ready to justifie what they did, by holding forth to the world their right in making such kind of Contracts: But what in this case falls into special consideration, is, that the foresaid Contracts made by the Ne∣therlandish Companie, was during the Warr with England, or before the peace concluded anno 1667. was, or could be known in the In∣dies, or at Macassar.</P>
<P>So then although all were true what is publi∣shed in a certain writing, and by Mr. Skelton, Envoy Extraordinarie, annexed to the fore∣said Memorial, presented to your Puis. High∣nesses, that we had violently seased on the Factors of the English Company, carried them away prisonners to Batavia, and then spoiled their Houses (although the Companie, upon their Faith and Credit, are ignorant hereof) what could this any way help the English, or why should they thus exclaime about it? Hath not England about this verie time taken by force New-Netherland from our West-Indie Companie, &amp; can the Dutch West-Indie Com∣panie frame an action or pretence hereon? With∣out doubt, No.</P>
<P>The English Companie finding themselves destitute of necessarie proofs to make good
<PB N="63" REF="31"/>the matter of Fact, they charge the Dutch Companie with, which nevertheless can only serve as the foundation of what they urge, as also being convinced of the unanswerable con∣futation made by the Dutch Companie, with most evident demonstration of the ungrounded∣ness of the assertions of the English Companie, they betake themselves in their Reply to re∣proches, calumniating the Dutch Companie in the conduct of their affaires after so odious a manner, and in such extravagant termes, as must needs make all men astonished, how peo∣ple of honour and understanding should so for∣get themselves, yea so far as that the English Commissaries themselves in the conference with the Commissaries who on our side were, to decide the business, were constrained to abhor and manifest their discontent thereof: And although the Dutch wanted no matter to convince the English Companie of their in∣tollerable injurie, and to disabuse the World of so many untruths falsly imputed to them, yet they judged it better to abstain and with a modest silence to pass it by, then enter into further contest, and make the rupture of the Friendship (which is so necessary between both the Companies) yet greater, and the wound incurable.</P>
<P>The Demand the Dutch Company made by reconvention, consisted herein, that they at the earnest request of the English Companie had lent or accommodated them with four Ves∣sels,
<PB N="64" REF="32"/>for the transport of their persons, mer∣chandises and effects from Bantam to Batavia, under promise by writing to pay the Dutch Companie for the fraight, these Ships they kept some moneths, making use of them in stead of Magasins, and for preservation of their wares and effects, to the great prejudice of the Dutch Companie, who stood in verie great need of them, in respect of their traffick, but could not get them again what meanes and insinuations soever they used, till some months after.</P>

<P>It remains that we speak a word or two of what happened before Gamron in the Gulph of Persia, over which also the English Com∣panie make their complaints, first, in a certain Article in their Triplick, and afterward by that writing which the foresaid Mr. Skelton Extraordinarie Envoy, annexed to the foresaid Memorial by him presented the .. of May last to your Puis. Highnesses, of which men∣tion was made in the beginning: This Ar∣ticle containes first complaints against the con∣duct of the Fleet, which lately the Dutch Company had in the Gulph of Persia with
<PB N="65" REF="32"/>which they entended, as they say, to shut or lock up all the Havens of that great Kingdom.</P>
<P>And the said Memorial did further make like complaints that the foresaid Fleet conducted by Reynier Kasembroot, with violence should have hindred John Goldsborough Master of an English Companies Ship called the Marchant of Bengale, from onlading the said Ship with Boats, thereby detaintng and disturbing him in all their traffick and business: but after exa∣mination this complaint wil be found as ground∣less, as any of the other.</P>
<P>The case is this, that the Netherlandish Companie time out of mind, having a Comp∣toir or Lodge, together with their Traffick at Gamron, and other places in the Kingdom of Persia, by vertue of an agreement made with the King, and of Priviledges granted unto them, the Persians in many points set themselves in opposition against them, offring them many outragious and unjust dealings, and forasmuch as no reparation or redres in the least could be obtained by any requests made, although ac∣companied with extraordinarie and costlie pre∣sents, at last it burst forth into deeds, for to repair the injurie don, and this is the Fleet of Ships, which the Dutch Companie for this end had in the foresaid Gulph, with which they took from the Persians the Jland Kismus with the Castle in the said Gulph, not far distant from Ormus or Gamron, not for to keep, for it could not have been serviceable to us, but with
<PB N="66" REF="33"/>intollerable charge, onely it was don to induce and necessitate the Persians to condescend to reason, which it also effected, whereupon the Netherlandish Companie restored the I land and the Castle to the Persians again.</P>
<P>What then concerns the first complaint, that with that Fleet the Netherlandish Companie sought to shut up all the Havens in Persia, the Netherlandish Companie is necessitated to say, that it is verie strange to them, that they should so wrongfully and malitiously misconster the good intention of the Netherlandish Com∣pany.</P>
<P>Hath the Dutch Company with that Fleet of Ships done them the least wrong or hinde∣rance, as to what concerns their coming or departing in or from the said Havens? yea even during the time that the Netherlandish Com∣panie lay with the whole Fleet before Gamron? Have not the English sayled in and out, as they pleased? They cannot but say, yea.</P>
<P>What reason had they then to judge so mali∣tiously of their design.</P>
<P>But in the foresaid Triplick it is said, that the Netherlandish Company intended indeed to set on foot and effect it, in case the English had not by hap appeared there with a greater num∣ber of Ships, not to be hindred or forced by the Netherlanders.</P>
<P>But before they were arrived there with any number of Ships together, did not the foresaid Fleet and the said Kasembroot let their single
<PB N="67" REF="33"/>Ships go in and out freely and unmolested, yea even their Boats and Chalops: and with them also their Ship Williamson loden with Goods fraited for and belonging to the Persians? Sure∣ly they cannot deny it.</P>
<P>And what concerns this great number of Ships, which they say they afterward had there, if compared with the number, espe∣cially the greatness of the Netherlandish Ships, all mounted, mand, and in gallant equi∣page for Warr, they were strong enuff, had they had order, to have kept them out of Gam∣ron.</P>
<P>The Netherlandish Fleet lay a year and some months before Gamron, and the English were but a small time with their foresaid number of Ships there, whereas before and after there came other, yea single Ships, to and fro, and yet according to their own confession no stop or hinderance was don to any of them, save on∣ly to the Ship called the Marchant of Bengale before mentioned, and of which shall be further spoken by and by.</P>
<P>From whence then is it evinced, that the Dutch Company had such a design, or what proofs do they bring, to justifie what they de∣pose in their foresaid Reply? Not one only word.</P>
<P>But to say how the case stands, the Nether∣landish Companie undertakes to shew, that the said Kasembroot, commanding the said Fleet in Chief in the Gulph of Persia, did all
<PB N="68" REF="34"/>the time of his abode there, by express order and command, forbid, that no let or hinde∣rance should in the least be offered to the En∣glish Ships in their navigation and traffick in that Kingdom.</P>
<P>And, that the Dutch Companies manage∣ment might be rendred the more suspected and odious, they conclude thus in their Triplick, these are the meanes which the Dutch Com∣panie useth, for to get great advantages upon the Indian Princes, yea have thereby con∣strained that great and mightie King of Persia himself to subscribe such Articles, as they would, that he might have his Havens again open and free.</P>
<P>But besides that the Netherlandish Compa∣nie hath not, by all those excessive charges, covenanted or acquired any greater priviledges or advantages then they alwayes formerly have had in the Kingdom, except onely a discharge from taking yearly a quantity of Silk at a cer∣tain price, (at least so far as concerns the last) according to the advice, which the Dutch Companie lately received concerning the same.</P>
<P>And in case the great Princes of the Indies, and the King of Persia himself were so easily to be forced by such a Fleet as the Dutch Companie had there, we have reason to de∣mand, why the English Companie did not make use of that occasion, namely when they had present such a Fleet as they boast of be∣fore
<PB N="69" REF="34"/>Gamron, for to recover of the Persians payment of the Tol or Custom of Ormus or Gamron, which they say was so truely due unto them, but unjustly detained by the Per∣sians, at least as to the greater part thereof, and which in the year 1654. they demanded, as to the half thereof, amounting to many hundred thousand gilders, of the Netherlandish Companie, to wit, of the Goods which the said Dutch Company until that time had brought and negotiated there, but was then by Committies on both parts denyed to be due to them, and they remitted to the Persians them∣selves, where they so often importuned them by their complaints, yea even to the threatning of them, but neverthless could never obtain any satisfaction: would they not in all that time, wherein these pretences have since en∣creased to such vast sums, if it had bin to be acquired with such facility, have used these wayes and meanes? Undoubtedly yea.</P>
<P>And thereby we may wel judge, what was the Constitution of that Fleet they had there, and of which they made such high boasts.</P>
<P>But in case they should yet attempt the same, could the Netherlandish Company, although much prejudiced thereby in their Traffick, as undoubted would so be, could they thereupon lay any action to the charge of the English Company, and make pretences upon them?</P>
<PB N="70" REF="35"/>
<P>Surely the Dutch Companie would wish, yea, entreat in a friendly way, that if such a thing should be, our Ships might have the like usage, as the Dutch Companie did shew to the English.</P>
<P>As to the second complaint, namely the hin∣derance occasioned to the Ship the Marchant of Bengale in her unloding, by detaining and disturbing them in their Traffick and under∣takings.</P>
<P>Thus stands the case: The Dutch Company, as hath been said, having War with the Per∣sians, or being as they say, <HI>in statu belli,</HI> and laying with their Fleet before Gamron, there came tyding from Land, that there was an intent to bord our Fleet by fire Ships, and so cause us to leave the rode; whereupon we re∣solved to cease on all the Persian Boats we could get, and make them fast behind our Ships: the foresaid English Ship laying in the midst of our Fleet, and making preparation to unlode in Persian Boats, the said Kasembroot desired them to be pleased to desist, and not to make use of Persian Boats, especially they being accustomed to take in their loding in the night time to be verie earlie at land to unlode, we offring them al the Boats of our Ships to assist them, that we might be certain, that they under the cloack of coming to the foresaid Ship, with their Fireships, and passing by our watch, might not before we were aware, fal upon us; but they of the foresaid Ship re∣jecting
<PB N="71" REF="35"/>our proffer, there came among our Fleet a Persian Boat, mand with ten or twelve Persian Rowers and one English Mariner, ha∣ving by him two cases with Rosewater, which the said Kasembroot caused to be brought into his Ship: the English Interpreter presently there∣upon making his complaint, the former proffer of our Boats was renieuwed, and at his going away bid to take with him the two cases of Rosewater, which he refusing, they were put into his Boat, and so he departed.</P>
<P>This being the true historie, we demand, what herein was don amisse by the Dutch Com∣panie, to cause the English to make such cla∣morous complaints about it? Or whither if any hinderance came thereby to the English (for damage they had none) they brought it not up∣on their own heads?</P>
<P>The goods they accuse us to have taken out of the Persian boat (which neverthelesse they themselves confesse were agayn restored, and put into the boat where the English interpre∣ter was) They aggravate, for to make them, in all apearance, to seem of great impor∣tance; were onely the foresaid two Cases of Rosewater.</P>
<P>In the Contra-Protest, the foresaid Kasem∣broot hath made agaynst the Protest of the En∣glish (and to which they appeal) the whole carriage of the businesse is nakedly and clear∣ly made to appeare, for which reason they also thought good, as the said Extraordinarie
<PB N="72" REF="36"/>Envoy annexed the said Protest of the En∣glish to his foresaid Memorial, here withal also to deliver over this Contra-Protest.</P>
<P>Thereby more plainly to shew: first, the Proffer we made of our boats for their service to unlode their said ship, partly to take away the hinderance they Complayned of, and on the other hand to prevent the mischief, which by the going to and fro of the enemies boats, (which they might have pretended to be don only in the name and by the order of the En∣glish) could have befallen our fleet.</P>
<P>Again, that the goods taken out the Per∣sian Boat, but again restored, were nothing but the said Cases of Rosewater.</P>
<P>And thirdly, that the English, during our dissention with the Persians, did al what they could to incense them agaynst us by Calum∣nies and falshoods, which also did remarke∣ably retard and set back our Businesse at Court, to the great losse and detriment of the Dutch Companie.</P>
<P>Espetially by the promises they made the Persians with six ships to chase us from the Rode of Gamron, and out of the Fort of Kis∣mus, whenas neverthelesse our said fleet con∣sisted of nine ships, and of which the Dutch Companie expects due information at the re∣turn of our fleet.</P>
<P>And hereby the directors of the Netherlan∣dish Companie hope they have Satisfied the de∣sire of your Puissant Highnesses, having mani∣fested
<PB N="73" REF="36"/>on the one hand the Notorious un∣groundednesse of all the Complaints brought in by the English, and on the otherhand the in∣tegritie of the Netherlandish Companie in these matters: and that thereby your Puissant High∣nesses wil the more be incited, to appeare for the Dutch Companie in so righteous a cause, and to Protect them agaynst al and Everie one, that shal endeavor for this any wayes to molest or injurie them, which by these presents we most humbly request; having judged that the importance of the Cause, and the multiplicitie of enormous acts where with the Netherlandish Companie is Loaden, and that we might re∣fute al these things in a due manner, as also giue pour Puissant Highnesses a Grounded infor∣mation, did require this our Large Exhibi∣tion of things, and which in all humilitie we beg may not be unacceptable to your Puissant Highnesses.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE received yesternight the Pro∣test you sent, and greatly wonder at the aggrierances you make about a Persian bark passing through our fleet, and for some time detained by us, which you affirm to have hired for to unlade the Merchandises, of the ship called the Merchant of Bengale, to which we answer, that it can not be unknown to you that we have more then a year secured this Rode and Gulph with eight or nine ships, and notwithstanding that our Commissioners for the compounding of the differences are at present at the court of Persia, yet our men some few dayes agoe have in a most hostile man∣ner bin driven from land, our flag taken down, and we as is noysed by them of Gamron, threatned to be assaulted here in the Rode by a number of barcks, manned with Persian Mi∣litia, so that nature treacheth us to be upon our watch, and we thereuppon thought it necessarie
<PB N="75" REF="37"/>to sease all the Persian boats, yet without the least thought of doeing any let or hinderance to you, as your selves know that in the unla∣ding of the ship Williamson was not don, al∣though the said ship both going and comming was fraighted with Persian goods, but on the contrarie the day before yesterday, when we stopt the Persian Barq, which would have passed our fleet, we proffered your Truchman David all our own boats for to help the said ship to un∣lade, both because we would not hinder them in their affaires, as also to secure our own ships from the threatned mischiefs, (which by the swarving of the Enemies boats, pretending to com in the name and by the order of the En∣glish) might have befallen us. But it seemeth, you were rather prone thus unjustly to accuse us, that we should have detained your goods (which were onely the two cases of Rosewater) then to embrace the kinde proffer of our Boats: The said, David your Truchman tooke the two Cases into the scute wherin he came from land, at the same time the the barck came abord to us, and himself caried them away with him: And for as much as it seemeth to be your wonted manner, by intricate and practised insertions to render things obscure, this your ungrounded accusations are not strange unto us, as having since this expedition, with much patience born all the calumnious reproches, wherewith you have a long time sought to make us odious to the Persian Na∣tion
<PB N="76" REF="38"/>to retard our agreement with them, Espe∣tially promising them, to make us, with six of your ships, to retire out of this Rode, and out of Kismus, of al which we have suffitient proofs to shew, and withal to make it appeare, we had not given you the least reason or provocation thereto: Al which hath bin to the apparent dammage of our Com∣panie, and besides this yee seek also to con∣strain us to let our Enemies barcks to pas and repas our fleet: Wherefore in the name of the Netherlandish East-Indie Companie we doe Protest we are innocent of al the blood, slaugh∣ter, losses and inconveniences which shall result from thence, on the one or other hand: Given in our ship, the Blaw-Hulck laying in the Rode before Gamron.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THe English East-Indie Companie in a Request they presented to his Majesty of Great Britain 29. June 1687. say, they have had advise by divers Ships niewly arrived, of the injuries and violences the Hollanders have exercised against the English on the Coast of Cormandel, under pretext of having warr with the King of Golcondach.</P>
<P>That they made themselves master of Met∣chalapatam, after the same manner they ceased Bantam.</P>
<P>That they had prohibited the English eight weeks ago to Traffick there any more, al∣though, they have had their residence and Ma∣gasin there eightie or ninetie yeares together, and that the Magasin was built by the Com∣pany,
<PB N="91" REF="45"/>and that they bought the verie ground upon which it was erected, as may be seen in the writing of the Governor and the Dutch Counsel at Pollicats.</P>
<P>That the Hollanders in time of peace did by main force Assault the Fort the English had built at Batancapas, seated on the West-Coast of Sumatra, to secure themselves the better of the Traffick in Pepper; that in con∣tempt they brake and tore in peeces the Pa∣villion of his Brittish Majesty where is was set up.</P>
<P>That they there pillaged the English.</P>
<P>And because it is apparent, the design of the Hollanders is to appropriate to themselves by violence, injustice and oppression the whole Trade of the East-Indies, The said Companie hopeth that his Majestie with the first will applie such remedies, as may prae∣vent the continual invasions of the Hollan∣ders.</P>
<P>A Letter of the Holland Companie from Pollicat, written the 13. August 1686. St. N. to Mr. William Gifford, Praesident of the English Companie, and to his Counsel at the Fort St. George.</P>
<P>It containes in substance, that the said Hol∣landish Companie hath bin evil treated, some years since, beyond the Coast of Cormandel, as also the North Coast from Onixa, unto Met∣chopotam, by the Ministers of State, and the Governors of the King of Gulcondach.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="46"/>
<P>That they often required justice, but to no purpose, and for to revenge themselves of these injuries, they had seased Metchopotem 16. July. That for a marck of the Friendship they desire to maintain with the English Company, they permit them, to embarck in their own Ships out of their Magasins at Metchepotam the effects the English had there, as also to take out in Barcks all the Provisions and all the Marchandises which shall com in their Ships to Metchopotam for to put them into their Magasins, yet upon condition that they shall carrie none out of the Citie of Metchopotam, to sell them to Marchants, or to the Sub∣jects of the King of Gulcondagh, until the said Company shall have satisfactions.</P>
<P>The sooner to obtain this satisfaction they had resolved not only to hold the mean while the said Citie in possession, but also to pre∣vent that the English should not suffer any da∣mage during these troubles, they though it fit to advertise them to bring into their Ma∣gasins the effects they had in the Countrie, and that within the space of 6. or 8. weeks, recko∣ning from the time the Companie had seased the said City.</P>
<P>That they will also have, that the English Company advertise theirs of all what they shall cause to be brought in, to the end that by the good order they shall hold, the incon∣veniences may be prevented, which otherwise might befal the English.</P>
<PB N="93" REF="46"/>
<P>Answer of Mr. William Gifford Praesident, and of the Councel of the English Company, dated .... 1686. written to the Hollands Company at Pollicat. It being in substance: That the English Company are not ignorant of the design the Dutch Company now hath in making themselves Masters in Metchapo∣tam.</P>
<P>That they could wish that the ruinating of the English Commerce were not the main end, the Hollanders now a long time had practised these tricks: Particularly at Bantam and since at Chimatra, but that the Hollanders were as yet to be responsable unto them.</P>
<P>That they have remarqued that the Hollan∣ders in all their Treaties they make with the Indian Kings and Princes, have endeavoured to exclude their Companie from Traffick in their Countries and Ports.</P>
<P>That this design is now discovered and re∣sented in Europe, that their presumption is to great to imposer Lawes to the English in such a manner, that now, since they are possessors of Metchapotam they will have the English to comport themselves as to their commerce there, according to their pleasurre: But the English are not obliged to follow their order, That the House and the ground upon which their Magasin is built is an heritage acquired by their own money.</P>
<P>That upon these grounds they counsel them to act with discretion and agreeing to justice.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="47"/>
<P>That they in the mean while will continue to traffick as formerly, and counsel the Hollan∣ders not to interrupt them, least they should attract sad consequences contrarie to their interest.</P>

<P>It containes first a Relation of the state of some of the affaires of the English Com∣pany.</P>
<P>Mr. Pots remits them to a certain Paper of 26. July to be informed of the cause of his voyage to Batancapas, and why he took with him so much of the Companies effects.</P>
<P>He gives reasons, why he did not wayt for orders or command, before he undertook the voyage, that it was, because the two Sons of the Emperor and the Mandarins, had ex∣treamly pressed him to hasten the voyage, as much as could be, lest the Hollanders being advertised of the design of the English, should settle themselves there before, and so the En∣glish be frustrated of their entreprise.</P>
<P>He departed, as he saith, from Indraponna 16. July, taking with him forty men Dome∣sticks and Soldiers, going with them to Paga∣son, to meet there the two Sons of the Empe∣ror Manuncabbo, who wayted them to go together to Batancapas, being in all 2000.
<PB N="95" REF="47"/>there to settle the English. That after 5 dayes voyage they arrived with the Emperor and the two Princes: and that the Emperor had bid the English to settle themselves there.</P>
<P>That three dayes before they arrived the Hollanders had settled and fortified them∣selves there upon a Rock on the other side of the river, notwithstanding that the Emperor and the Mandarins had commanded them to re∣tire, telling them that he had given the Coun∣trey to the King of Great Brittain to set the English Companie there; and that he had ne∣ver given permission to the Dutch to re∣side there.</P>
<P>That the same day of his arriving at Ba∣tancapas the Hollanders had sent him a Pro∣test, counselling him to take good heed of the Malayans, because they complayned that the English had wronged them by setling at Bancola and at Indraponna, places which, they sayd, had formerly bin given unto them.</P>
<P>That at the end of two dayes he sent them another Protest.</P>
<P>That the day after his arriving, the Em∣peror and his two sons arrived, and them∣selves planted the Pavillion of the King of England.</P>
<P>That the Hollanders had fortifyed them∣selves, as much as they could.</P>
<P>That during the 3 first weeks there was no opposition of the one or other part, al∣though the English did often presse the Mal∣layans
<PB N="96" REF="48"/>to fall upon the English.</P>
<P>That the Hollanders seeing that after all their perswasions, the Mallayans would do nothing, forced them to retire further up into the Countrie, about three miles towards the North, with design (as the Emperor and his men believed) to wast the Countrie, the Hou∣ses, and especially the City of Batancapas.</P>
<P>That to prevent this desolation the Emperor and his two Sons had drawn back their forces, except 60. or 70. Mallayans, whom they left there for to cover the works.</P>
<P>That after the retreat of these Troopes the the Hollanders in Batancapas the day after beeing the 23. August on a Friday and on the Sunday had shot with their greatest Canons at the people as they came to the Market in hope to make them afraid, and no more to supply the English, or to bring them any more provi∣sions.</P>
<P>That a Canon-bullet with two points striking a tree neer the Pallisado of the English Fort, burst asunder in two pieces.</P>
<P>That the day after they had dispatched Mr. Samuel Worly to the Hollanders to know of them the reason wherefore they had shot at the Magasin of the English and their men, and to tel their commander they would send a peece of the Bullet of the King of England, and in∣form him of the affront they had don to his Subjects, but the Commander not being then present Mr. Worly had don the message to an∣other
<PB N="97" REF="48"/>Gentleman that had the command in the absence of the other, the said Officer should have answered that he much wondred they should make such a work of one or two Ca∣mon shot, and pointing with his finger to divers Peeces not far off from him, should have said, behold there a great many, which shall be shot of, and not fayling of his word, the same afternoon 21. August he made two shot more, after the same manner as before.</P>
<P>That the Mallayans being affrighted, the greater part which remained with the English, deserted them.</P>
<P>That the Hollanders being advertised hereof, embarqued in their Chalops the Mallayans with a number of Dutch Soldiers.</P>
<P>That they fired continally their great Guns while they were in their Barqs, and at length having set foot on land, they with furie assaulted the small number of Mallayans, which were for the English, set on fire their Pallisado, and having put to flight the said Mallayans, they fell upon the English which were at the En∣trance of the Pallisado.</P>
<P>That a certain man named Mackolon, an Officer of the Hollanders, told him, that except he sought to escape, the Mallayans would kill him.</P>
<P>That not fearing their threats, the Holland∣ders had commanded the Mallayans to assault the English, but the Mallayans testifying their
<PB N="98" REF="49"/>dislike by refusing to do it, the Ensign-bearer set himself in the front, forced an entrance in∣to the Fort, being followed of some Mallayans and about 40. Hollanders.</P>
<P>That these Troopes were no sooner past the Pallissado, but they said to them and the other English, that if ever they entred more into the Fort, they might expect nothing else, but to be fallen upon.</P>
<P>That at the verie same instant the Dutch Soldiers and the Mallayans began to plunder, car∣rying away all they thought was of any worth, and gave it into the hands of their Comman∣ders, and while they were thus pillaging, the Dutch Soldiers in contempt, brake and tare in pieces the Flag of the King of England, which was set up there.</P>
<P>That after all these Violences the foresaid Officer by order of the Commander, prayd him to retire on the side of the Hollanders, pro∣mising in the name of the Commander, they would restore the Marchandise, Effects, Silver-work, Canon and all what might appertain to the English, and what should be found in the hands of the Mallayans.</P>
<P>That he thereupon going to the Comman∣der named Mackabon: he instead of performing what was promised, answered him, he could do nothing in it, and that what the Mallayans had taken, was justly acquired, and they could not be constrained to render the same: however
<PB N="99" REF="49"/>as for the Canon he would endeavor they might be restored.</P>
<P>But coming again to him, after he had ordered men and a boat to take in the Canon, there came some of his men and said, that in case we would have the Canon, the Mallayans pretended to have 500 dollars for them.</P>
<P>Seeing then too appearently that in this and in all other things the English were meerly de∣luded, he embarqued his Soldiers and men that were left, and returned to Indrapanna the 25. August.</P>

<P>WE have received your Puis: Highnesses Letter and therewith your Resolution of the first of this present, with an insertion of the Memorial presented to your Puiss: Highnesses, with an annex by the Marquis of Albiville Envoy Extraordinarie of his Royal Majestie of Great Brittain, which said Memorial containeth Complaints against the transactions and doings of the Ministers of the Netherlandish Com∣panie at Maslapatnam upon the Coast of Cor∣mandel and at Batancapas upon the West-coast of Sumatra, with their Request of reparation, concerning which your Puiss: Highnesses re∣quire information by us. We may not omit, High and Mightie Lords, to propose, with all
<PB N="100" REF="50"/>dutiful respect to your Puiss. Highnesses, that forasmuch as the said Appendix, is in effect the contents of such Letters, which the English Company, as they pretend, have lately re∣ceived out of the Indies, divers particulars are rehearsed in what manner the things they com∣plaine of were there transacted, of which we, by reason our Ships are not yet arrived, tho ex∣pected everie houre, cannot have perfect know∣ledge, may it therefore please your Puiss: Highnesses not to conster it amis, that we de∣ferre the same a while; however we say afore∣hand, that the said complaints, as they are pro∣posed in the said Memorial, are of two parts.</P>
<P>First, against the conduct of our people, in their actings at Maslupatnam: And secondly upon the West-Coast of Sumatra, with the wrong don to the English at both places.</P>
<P>As to the first, we apprehend, that by the information we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the last year out of India, and by another hand, (setting aside what we are yet exspecting) we want noe matter fully to justifie the transactions of our people there, and to demonstrate the ungroundedness of the foresaid complaints.</P>
<P>And what concerns the second, namely that by force we should have hindered them, that they could nor might settle themselves in the Countrie of the Prince of Indraponna, nor build Forts where they pleased, whereas that Prince, according to what they affirm, had made over
<PB N="101" REF="50"/>that Countrie to them, although we can not directly discover the perfect state and constitu∣tion of that business, vntil the Ships, which we dayly expect be arrived, nevertheless we are able by the information which we had the last year concerning it, to affirm from the contents of those Letters, that the English by reason of the unhealthfultness of that countrie, and the mortalitie it brought upon their men, with other difficulties, were entended yea did actu∣ally prepare do depart thence, so that we thought to have mentioned nothing more, nor troubled your Puis: Highnesses with that business, but have past it by in silence, but seeing out the foregoing Appendix we find it otherwise, we shall nor may not neglect to produce with the first opportunitie unto your Puis: Highness: our just complaints, and withal to shew the inju∣ries, losses and intrusions of the English upon the proprietie and right, which we (as to the West-coast) for a verie long time have had and acquired, and which we yet have the actual pos∣session and injoyment of, and can prove that they continually have sought to debauch, and draw from us these Princes, who in acknow∣ledgment of the benefits and services they re∣ceived from us, and among many other, that we had delivered them at our exceediing charge and expences out of the hands of their enemies under whose yoke they were brought, and moreover at whose Request, we have by solemn
<PB N="102" REF="51"/>Contracts taken upon us, and promised to de∣fend them against all and every one who should offer to do any injurie or violence unto them and for which they have declared us for their Sonverains, and in especial also that foremen∣tioned Prince of Indraponna, in whose Coun∣trey they have built a Fort, endeavouring forceablie to thrust us out of our possession, by depriving us of the injoyment we had: And yet they themselves confess that our people on the West-Coast have potested against the injuries they did to them, while they sought to settle themselves at Boucoulo and Indro∣ponna, countries and places, as the real truth is, belonging to us, of which the Contracts are in our hands time out of mind, and yet they cannot deny, that their people have set themselves against us by building of Forts to keep us out, yea they complain that we by raising a Fort have injuried and prevented them, and yet this is all the dammage and wrong, according to their own saying we have don them. If indeed the English could make it out and maintain, that they have a right, to com into a countrie of which the Soveraintie is made over to us, beside other engagements we have there, tho as they say, by consent of the said Prince (although that is not by us owned as true) to build Forts thereby to draw the Commerce into their hands, with the secluding of us, to whom the
<PB N="103" REF="51"/>right is only belonging, and yet we not have juste cause, by raising a Fort to prevent them: or that hereby they should have a main action against us: certainly this must needs come from another law then hitherto hath bin known to the world. They accuse us that we by <HI>pri∣vative</HI> Contracts have sought everie where to keep them from trading, and yet they make their appeal to such like Contracts, which themselves have made there. The English Companie shewes that they wilfully continue in their custom to make alwayes complaints how impertinent or ungrounded soever, thereby to preoccupy the world, yea to make an impres∣sion even in the inhabitants of this State it self, as if we sought nothing else, but made it our whole business to oppose and be thwarting of the English, as amongst other their complaints, this also may apparently be seen in the business of Bantam, which occasioned such commo∣tion and klatter almost in all places, and con∣cerning which the information stated by this Chamber above a year ago, and presented to your Puis: Highnesses hath clearly mani∣fested, what is to be judged of the carriage and conduct of the Netherlandish Companie in that matter, which in the first was so odiously set forth. But forasmuch as it is our intention after the arrival of our Ships, whose return from the Indies, we dayly expect, more am∣ply, by the permission of your Puiss: Highnesses
<PB N="104" REF="52"/>to treat of these and other things, when we shall have further light by the evidences we expect in those Ships, and to shew the injuries offred us; we will herewith conclude, praying, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>High and Mighry Lords:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Chamber of the <HI>East-Indie Company</HI> of Amsterdam, hath after the Assembling of the <HI>Seventien</HI> representing the said Com∣pany, and brought your puissant Highnesses Letter, with the annexed Resolution, both being of the first of August now past, con∣taining an Insertion of the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville,</HI> Envoy Extraordinary of his Royal Majesty of Great <HI>Brittain,</HI> pre∣sented unto your Puis: Highnesses, with an Annex; the said <HI>Memorial</HI> containing com∣plaints against the doing and transactions of the Ministers of our Company at <HI>Maslupat∣nam,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> and at <HI>Ba∣tancapas,</HI> upon the West-Coast of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> with demand of reparation for the Infractions and dammages, which the Subjects of his said Roya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Majesty should have suffered at both those places: and concerning which your Puiss: Highnesses were pleased to command us to bring in our Information: and by reason
<PB N="2" REF="53"/>the said Chamber could at that time give only a provisional Answer, dated the 7. of August, because the Ships by which we expected our Letters of Advice from the <HI>Indies,</HI> concerning these Affaires, were not as yet arrived. The last whereof, to which we were then necessi∣tated to refer our selves, being by Gods good providence some dayes since safely come unto us, and that thereby we now are in a capacity to inform your Puiss: Highnesses more pun∣ctually, we will with permission further say, that we find the foresaid complaints to be two∣fold: First, over the evil proceeding and con∣duct of our men at <HI>Maslupatnam,</HI> and secondly at <HI>Batancapas,</HI> where we, as they say, continu∣ally have exercised injustice and violence a∣gainst them.</P>
<P>What concerns the first, it will be necessary to dive somewhat more groundedly into that business, viz. After the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> had sustained and born many injuries, dam∣mages, and violences by the King of <HI>Golcon∣da,</HI> who was misled by his Chief Ministers, till at last the whole Traffick of the said Company in all the Northern Factories and Lodges was forbidden, and it was commanded to all the Regents and Officers, to deprive all the Factories and Minister <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hereof of all meanes of livelihood, and fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er that no wever nor handicrafts men should thence∣forward deliver any thing of what they had underhand unto them, all which was direct∣ly
<PB N="3" REF="53"/>contrary to the Octroy and Patents granted unto the said Company. That at last we jud∣ged it reasonable to have recourse to force and constraint, hoping thereby if possible to bring the King to better and more moderate thoughts, but before we would enter upon it, we though it best in an orderly way, to make our intent known to the King, who is judged by all to be a Prince of a good nature, and al∣ways hath shewn himself affectioned to the <HI>Ne∣therlandish Company,</HI> and the rather because the Government of <HI>Batavia,</HI> were fully assured that these Infractions and Troubles were oc∣casioned to our Company only by the evilaf∣fection and ill will of <HI>Madolena</HI> and <HI>Achena,</HI> the two Chief <HI>Ministers</HI> of that Kingdom, who had so remarkably injured the said Com∣pany, and invented a way to incite their King against us, without any right information how the case stood betwixt him and us, which said <HI>Ministers</HI> a while after by reason of in∣ward commotions occasioned by their ill ma∣nagement of Affairs came to a most miserable End. However the said Government of <HI>Ba∣tavia,</HI> to the end aforementioned sent a <HI>Com∣missarie</HI> with full Commission and Power to treat with the King, and if it might be to compose all things in a way of amitie: But our <HI>Commissary</HI> was so unsuccessful, that the King either could or would not assent to what we judged to be right and equal, in so much that to acquire the foresaid reparation and
<PB N="4" REF="54"/>satisfaction, we were necessitated by force of Arms, to assure and make our selves Master of <HI>Maslupatnam,</HI> in hope thereby to induce the King the sooner to listen to an accom∣modation, which also the 16. of July 1686. was effected without blood shed, and the Kings Militia was caused to depart, where∣upon we fortifyed the City against any inva∣sion which might happen. And because the <HI>English Company</HI> had a <HI>Factory</HI> and a <HI>Lodge</HI> there for their Commerce and Traffick, we by Letters in August following, let them or their <HI>Ministers</HI> know, that however we had the Power and possession of the City in our hands, our intention was not in the least to hinder or incommodate their Traffick, and that they might consequentially dispose of, and lade their goods they had or could make ready in their Ships, together with all their Provision and Marchandises, which might by Sea be brought unto them, and take it in∣to their Lodge, only that they should not dispose of them to the Subjects of that King, nor after the expiration of six or eight weeks suffer any goods more to be brought to them out of the Country.</P>
<P>This being thus passed, and we perceiving that the Enemy began to stirr, and to cast up works to besiege us, and gather an Army thereby to deprive us of our water and other means of Livelihood, we sent out our men against them, and with success raised the
<PB N="5" REF="54"/>Kings forces by driving them out of their Tents: and forasmuch as the Enemy had threatned and intended to burn the City, which was all built of Combustible matter, thereupon the <HI>English,</HI> with diverse others of the Inhabitants for fear of being consumed by fire, retired upward into the Country, but the King soon after resolving to come to a treatie of accomodation with us, which also was at length effected, by the promising repara∣tion of our Dammages, and that for the future they should no more deal thus unjustly with us, but suffer us to enjoy free trading as formerly; all which being agreed unto, we withdrew our Militia out the City, and gave it up again into the hands of the King.</P>
<P>This being the true state of the matter, hereupon the <HI>English</HI> Company makes com∣plaints by an Annex, to which the Memorial of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville</HI> hath relation, over Injuries and Violences offered them at <HI>Ma∣slupatnam,</HI> under the pretext of a War, which the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> had under∣taken against the King of <HI>Golconda:</HI> but they say they are well acquainted with such Tricks and Designs. And that we made our selves Masters of <HI>Maslupatnam,</HI> after the same man∣ner we before haddon of <HI>Bantam,</HI> to no other end then thereby to ruinate and deprive the En∣glish of their Traffick.</P>
<P>That we had play'd such prancks to often, especially at <HI>Bantam,</HI> and afterward at <HI>Suma∣tra,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="55"/>however they doubted not but we should be responsable for the same.</P>
<P>That we forbade them after the Expiration of eight weeks to trade any more at <HI>Maslu∣patnam,</HI> notwithstanding they there have had their place of Residence and Magasin above eighty or ninety years together, and had built the same at their expences upon ground bought with their own money.</P>
<P>That in all the Treaties we have made with the Kings and Princes of those Countries, we always endeavoured to exclude their Com∣pany from the Trade and Havens of those places, thereby wholy to annihilate their Commerce, but that notwithstanding the foresaid Insinuation they did intend to keep up their trading at <HI>Maslupatnam.</HI></P>
<P>Truly here is a wonderful kind of Lan∣guage, and by it may be perceived, how easy it is to Misconster a sincere and upright inten∣tion, and wrest it to a bad sense.</P>
<P>The questions then naturally flowing from hence are these, viz.</P>
<P>First, Whether our Company did undertake this War out of an evil intention and desire, under that pretext to offer injury and violence to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Whether it be true, that our Design was to make our selves Masters of <HI>Maslupatnam,</HI> after the same manner as we had don of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and with no other end and intention than thereby to effect the ruine
<PB N="7" REF="55"/>of the Commerce of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Whether it be true, that we had forbode them their Traffick at <HI>Maslupatnam,</HI> after the expiring of eight weeks.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Whether it then were, or yet is in the power of the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> to enter into such Leagues and Contracts with the Princes of those Countries, by which other Nations should be secluded from trading in any of the Wares or Fruits growing in those Countries.</P>
<P>What concerns the first, it is known to all, that the <HI>East Indie Company</HI> of these Lands, is the only erected Companie of Commerce for to enjoy by and thro an honest trading in Countries so far remote from us, the profits which we hoped might thence ensue.</P>
<P>But forasmuch as we found by sad expe∣rience, that we should have to doe with Na∣tions which were not to be too much trusted, and had evilly entreated many of our Traders, yea, murdered some of them, which before an Octroy was granted, had negotiated with them, it seemed good to the <HI>States</HI> of our Country, to prevent such mischiefs, to qua∣lify and Authorise by a granted Octroy to this <HI>Company,</HI> to procure reparation by all such meanes as should be judged most conve∣nient by them, with further Authority to make Leagues and Contracts with the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Potentates</HI> of those Nations, and to erect and build Forts and Castles as might serve for their security.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="56"/>
<P>These Wars then were not to be under∣taken, but only in case of urgent necessity, af∣ter all wayes of Accommodation and con∣descention had in vain been attempted.</P>
<P>It is a thing that speaks of it self, that be∣tween Marchandising and War there is no a∣greement, and that Merchants can no wise have any interest thereby, and the <HI>Companie</HI> therefore had precise Orders to shun it as much as possibly might be.</P>
<P>So that it is most absurd to suppose the <HI>Company</HI> should have engaged in that War against the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> so potent a Prince, and only out of a jollitie of spirit, A War which we knew aforehand, that be∣sides the cessation of Traffick, would draw after it such charges and losses, without any expectation (save only hopes of reparation and dammages sustained) the verie least pro∣fit imaginable, muchless, that our main aim should have been to incommodate the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> or eause other Dammage to accrue to them. Certainly the said <HI>Netherlandish Com∣pany</HI> ought not to be lookt upon so void of all sense as to cast themselves upon such heavie charges and troubles by a War, the issue of which is uncertain, and that only to incommodate and cause some loss to a <HI>third partie,</HI> whereas the charges and hinderance to their own Commerce would be of more importance an hundred fold, then the Dam∣mage of that <HI>third partie</HI> could amount to.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="56"/>
<P>And besides what hath the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> further and more insisted upon or obtained, then the continuance of their former Commerce, according as it was granted un∣to them by Octroy, or, as they call it in those Countreys, by <HI>Firman?</HI></P>
<P>Have they made any Contracts with the King to the prejudice or dammage of the <HI>English Company?</HI> Not in the least: What a∣greement or comparison then is there between this business and <HI>Bantam?</HI> In <HI>Bantam</HI> the <HI>Ne∣therlandish Company</HI> was Auxiliary to Succour an oppressed King, whose condition and state was brought to the very point of utter ruine, and who in this desperate juncture im∣plored our Auxiliary Forces against his Re∣bels, and by whose means he was delivered from that oppression.</P>
<P>For which the King granted, or rather, we bargained and required nothing else, but the Trade in his City and Country, with Se∣clusion of all other, not to continue alwayes, but only so long till the promise made of reim∣boursing the charges we had been at in af∣fording our help to him, and which by mu∣tual consent was summed up, should be per∣formed.</P>
<P>This also may serve to demonstrate the Mo∣deration of the <HI>Netherlandish Companie,</HI> in re∣gard of the interest of the <HI>English Companie.</HI> True the Troopes of the <HI>Netherlandish Com∣pany</HI> are still in <HI>Bantam;</HI> but hath not the
<PB N="10" REF="57"/>King power to this? May he not retain them in his City for his service and the security of his Person and State, and without whom he could not, as he declareth, subsist or be se∣cure among his Subjects, especially those that had been up in Rebellion against him, of whom he was not much beloved, and also the Old King his Father, being yet alive.</P>
<P>By this also an Answer is sufficiently made unto the second Point, with this Addition only, that it is very rediculous to think, that the <HI>Dutch Company</HI> should have intended by this War aganst <HI>Golconda;</HI> to plot the over∣throw and ruin of the <HI>English Companies</HI> Commerce (which notwithstanding they ma∣litiously lay to our charge) as by the event also hath clearly appeared.</P>
<P>And because, as before hath been said, we foresaw that the Erecting of the <HI>Netherlan∣dish Company</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> could not be maintained without force of Armes, therefore, as has been said, the <HI>States</HI> did in a special man∣ner authorise them thereto.</P>
<P>Whereupon the <HI>English Company</HI> percei∣ving they were deprived of such a power, did in imitation, of what the <HI>States</HI> had granted to us, also procure an <HI>Octroy</HI> or <HI>Charter</HI> from the King now reigning, of which till that time they were unprovided, and by reason of which, were fain to suffer those injuries and Violences patiently, which now the one and then another of the Princes, Potentates, and
<PB N="11" REF="57"/>Nations molested them with, and still must have suffered, had they not by special Autho∣rity been impowred to an offensive War in such case as might fall out. And therefore as soon as they had obtained that Charter, they by virtue thereof took up Arms against the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> in <HI>Bengale,</HI> and as is thought also in <HI>Suratte.</HI></P>
<P>And might not now the <HI>Dutch Companie</HI> with as good ground and reason affirm, that the <HI>English Company</HI> hath undertaken this War, thereby to incommodate, endammage and enterrupt us in our Trading, which is ve∣ry considerable in those Countries.</P>
<P>And in case we should make complaints a∣gainst them, would they desist, or be per∣swaded to make no further Progress in their Affairs? Undoubtly they would not. Or if we should hereupon become troublesom to them, might they not justly help themselves with the known Rule, <HI>that he who useth his own Right, doth hurt no man thereby.</HI> Yet thus <HI>Self-love</HI> and <HI>Interest</HI> doth blind the Eyes of men.</P>
<P>We only wish and desire, that in such cases of their Warr, which they wage, our <HI>Dutch Company</HI> may be treated, and have the same measure as the <HI>English Company</HI> hath had, all the while the <HI>Dutch Company</HI> made War with the King of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Golconda.</HI></P>
<P>The third Point, so as it is couched and laid down in the <HI>Annex</HI> of the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the
<PB N="12" REF="58"/>Marquis of <HI>Albiville,</HI> is altogether abusive and untrue, to wit, That we had forbidden them after the expiring of eight weekes to negotiate there any more.</P>
<P>True, we understood it fit, and so forbade them that after the expiration of eight weekes, they should bring no more Wares which they might have bespoken, from the Countrie in∣to the City, for if they would, they had op∣portunities enough to bring in all they had du∣ring this time.</P>
<P>But here the quesion may be: Whether in this we have not don amiss and contrary to <HI>Right of Nations?</HI></P>
<P>First, by Sea we hindred them not, but out of our own goodwill, although we had a Squadron of Ships before the City, permitted them freely to traffick; yea they might du∣ring the space of these eight weeks, cause all what they had in the Country to be brought unto them. Now in stead that they ought to have taken and owned this as a great Civilitie condescention and benefit to them, this they make a point or Article of their complaint and accusation, but with as little ground, as in all the rest.</P>
<P>It is well known, that when the <HI>French, English, Spaniard, Portugises</HI> and others, make Conquests of any Countries or Places beyond <HI>Europe,</HI> they then forbid Navigation and Traf∣fick unto all Strangers in the said placcs.</P>
<P>Yea so far that some of them, if they only
<PB N="13" REF="58"/>spie at Sea a strange ship though at some di∣stance, seemingly approching their Countries, they bord, take and confiscate them.</P>
<P>In conformity and according to this practise the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> after they were becom masters of <HI>Maslupatnam,</HI> might have forbidden the <HI>Navigation</HI> and all Commerce unto the <HI>English Company.</HI></P>
<P>For altho the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> made use and tooke possession of the City, to no other End, then only to bring the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> the sooner to reasonable termes; yet they could not be certain, whether it should have such success as they expected, or how long it might be before it were effected.</P>
<P>And in the mean while, why might they not order themselves according to the <HI>Rule</HI> of other Nations, and especially that which the <HI>En∣glish</HI> themselves beyond <HI>Europe</HI> doe practise; yea which the <HI>English Company</HI> doth do in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> also, as shall more largely by and by be dilated.</P>
<P>How then can it be ill taken or imputed an Injurie don by the <HI>Dutch Company,</HI> that they only required, that the <HI>English Company,</HI> after the expiration of eight weekes, should let no more Wares of the Country, to be brought into the City, or to hold correspondence with the Enemies of the <HI>Netherlandish Company.</HI></P>
<P>For if all what was carried out, and brought in into the City, should have been at the plea∣sure of the <HI>English Company,</HI> while the Ene∣my
<PB N="14" REF="59"/>lay posted with his Army round about the same, it would certainly have been of too dangerous a consequence to the <HI>Netherlandish Company.</HI></P>
<P>They might therefore during the time the City was in their power, in matters of such a nature, order and dispose of things, as they judged most convenient.</P>
<P>Neither can any justly interpret this in an evil sense, although it had been don here in <HI>Eu∣rope:</HI> Namely to forbid that in a City surroun∣ded and besieged by Land, nothing be brought in and out, and that thro the Army of the E∣nemy, who undoubtedly neither could nor would permit the same.</P>
<P>But put the case that it might in some respect be controverted and disputed (which certainly in reason can not be imagined) yet then it ought to be enquired into, whether by that Letter or Insinuation any dammage did accrue unto them.</P>
<P>For, as before hath been said, the <HI>English</HI> did of their own accord retire out of <HI>Maslu∣patnam,</HI> leaving the City for fear of being burnt by fire.</P>
<P>And again, they do not say, that any stop or hinderance was done to them in their Com∣merce: for on the contrary in their Answer un∣to the Insinuation (as may be seen in the fore∣said Annex to the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville</HI>) they affirm that they would con∣tinue their Traffick as before.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="59" MS="y"/>
<P>Thirdly, the English had divers other Lodges more, by, or not far from <HI>Maslupat∣nam,</HI> where they could without any molest drive their trade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yea <HI>Madraspamen</HI> it self, and the Fort <HI>St. George,</HI> which was their own Place and Fortresse, being also in the said Kingdom of <HI>Golconda,</HI> and where they have their Capital or chief House of trading, lying also neere thereunto.</P>
<P>And forasmuch as they could there receive Wares out of that Kingdom as well as out of <HI>Maslupatnam,</HI> hence it manifestly appeareth that the suspition which the <HI>English Company</HI> would blot us with, as if we had remarkablie injured them in their Traffick in the King∣dom of <HI>Golconda,</HI> is altogether ungrounded and frivolous.</P>
<P>The following fourth Point, concerning the making of Contracts <HI>Privative</HI> (or by way of Seclusion) with divers Princes in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> about some kind of Wares and Fruits growing in their Countries, shall be spoken to hereafter, upon the subject treating of the West Coast of <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P>Comming then to the second Capital point, to wit, the Infraction and dammages our men should have done to the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch</HI> at <HI>Batancapas,</HI> lying on the West-Coast of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> we will with the permission of your Puiss. Highnesses, first a little speak of the commodiousness and conveniences of those Countries, and then come to the Matter it self.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="60"/>
<P>It is thus, the foresaid Coast is divided into divers Regions and Jurisdictions, of which <HI>Bon∣coulo, Sillebaer,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>South,</HI> far beyond the Straites of <HI>Sunda,</HI> do belong to the King of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and again from <HI>Boncoule Northwards</HI> unto <HI>Sinckal,</HI> are under the Command of the <HI>Netherlandish Company.</HI> The Prince and People of these Countries were in part subjected to the <HI>Netherlndish Company,</HI> for and in acknowledgment of the Benefits they had received from us, being to our vast expences and trouble, freed from oppression, and having our promise to take them into our protection.</P>
<P>And partly by the War these mutinous and unfaithful people waged against us, for thereby beeing subdued and brought under our power, they were forced not only to acknowledg that Soverainity we had, but also by Contract to oblige themselves to deliver unto us at a cer∣tain rate all the Pepper and other commodities their Countries yielded with excluding of all other Nations, not only <HI>Indians,</HI> but <HI>Europians</HI> also.</P>
<P>And what concerns <HI>Boncoulo,</HI> it is true the <HI>English</HI> some years past, came with their Forces, and possessed themsclves thereof, un∣der pretext that the Old King of <HI>Bantam</HI> had during the Civil Wars (in which he was ta∣ken Prisoner) granted to them free Trading, and Habitation at <HI>Sillebaer,</HI> but were driven out of the last place by the forces of the King
<PB N="17" REF="60"/>that now reigneth in <HI>Bantam,</HI> they retired to <HI>Boucoulo,</HI> and built a Fortresse there, where they yet keep their abode, and from thence did transport and wrest out of our hands a verie considerable part of Pepper, we say, wrested, forasmuch as it was by Contract with <HI>Bantam</HI> made over to us, whereby although they have intruded into what belonged to us, to our great detriment; yet we will pass that by, as not being ignorant that such manner of Contracts and Obligations made with Princes in whose Countries, where we have only Lodges or Factories, doe give us no ful right actually to hinder other Nations for to buy and transport their Commodities, but must leave it to the disposal of him that is Lord and Master of those Countries.</P>
<P>But that we should be constrained to suf∣fer other Nations to come and Traffick in the Countries where, besides such Contracts, we have and exercise Superiority, and permit them also for the security of their Commerce to build Forts there, is a thing that none who are of a sound and sedate Judgment, would so much as imagine; and yet this is the que∣stion that here must be agitated.</P>
<P>For the <HI>English</HI> as hath been said, did not on∣ly not content themselves to settle at <HI>Boucoulo,</HI> the Territory of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and build a Fortresse there, but did advance even to <HI>Indraporina,</HI> took post, and erected a Fort there also, and this they did, notwithstanding the Protesta∣tions
<PB N="18" REF="61"/>and friendly Informations of the <HI>Ne∣therlandish Company</HI> against it, as infringing their right, in a Country in subjection for many yeares unto the <HI>Dutch Company,</HI> and where they, besides the Contracts made with the People, doe exercise all Acts of Soverain∣ty, and of which they have the Agreements and Contracts, lying by them to shew. Now this is it, for which the <HI>Dutch Company</HI> doth judge they have reason so greatlie to com∣plain, of which by and by we shall more fully speak.</P>
<P>Of the same nature is that of <HI>Batancapas,</HI> of which in special mention is made in the foresaid <HI>Memorial</HI> and <HI>Annex,</HI> lying be∣tween <HI>Indraporina</HI> and <HI>Sullida,</HI> neer about three or four Miles from the last place men∣tioned, properly appertaining to this Com∣pany, where they of the <HI>English Company</HI> do themselves pretend, that by or over against our Fort aforesaid, they also erected one, but were prevented by us, and over which prevention they make heavie complaints in their said <HI>Annex,</HI> but without any ground at all, as shall appear by what followeth.</P>
<P>The Historie, according as things were transacted, is this: After that <HI>Sapoele Boa∣handslaers,</HI> unto whom <HI>Batancapas</HI> also was be∣longing, being a perfidious and mutinous people, had divers times before, and now a∣gain of late lift up themselves against the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> breaking the fidelity
<PB N="19" REF="61"/>they had sworn, and the Contracts they had made with them; yet the <HI>Dutch Com∣pany</HI> upon their submission, and laying down their <HI>Arms</HI> in March 1686. did again receive them into favour, making a strickter Contract with them, and that for the future they would, according to promise, remain in their fidelity, Obedience and Submission to the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> and hence∣forward respect and obey the Governour at <HI>Badang,</HI> being the chief place of the said Company on the said West-coast, without ever declining, upon pain of being declared Ene∣mies, and brought under the everlasting wrath of God over them and their posterity; and be∣sides with this condition, that all the Gold, Pepper and other Wares their Countries yielded, or which were brought thither, should only be and remain for the <HI>Nether∣landish Company,</HI> they paying the ordinary price for them, as by the foresaid Contract in the keeping of the <HI>Dutch Company</HI> is more at large to be seen, which was agreed on 15. March 1686. being many Months before the <HI>English Company,</HI> according their own con∣fession, came to <HI>Batancapas.</HI> And no sooner were they come thither but endeavoured to mislead the people of <HI>Batancapas,</HI> and to draw them from their Fidelity and Obedi∣ence; but wel knowing what kind of People they were and how little to be trusted, they erected a Fortresse in their Land, but
<PB N="20" REF="62"/>were by the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> accord∣ing to their own saying, prevented by build∣ing a Fort there also.</P>
<P>While things were in this state, it hap∣pened that some of the Nadias that were fallen of with their men, did in the presence of six English, as Enemies, set upon us in the foresaid Post, and drive our men a Canon∣shot out of the Fort among the Inhabitants, by which, as was reported, four of the fore∣said Inlanders were slain: but as in such times and cases of that nature, all are not alike mu∣tinous and of the same mind, thereupon they who remained faithful, went out against them that were fallen off, to drive them from thence, and made themselves Masters of the English Fort, and except it had been for our intervention, they would have murthered all the English in their retrait: but whatever they left behind, as they desired by their Let∣ter, was as much as possibly could be, not only restored to them, but what is more, at their Request we provided them all manner of provisions of meat and drinck, &amp;c. for which also in their Letters dated the 22. and 26. Au∣gust 1686. they were very thankful unto us, as we can shew by them, in the last of which Letters one of their men wrote, that he was come there, to wit to <HI>Batancapas,</HI> with or∣der to see whether <HI>(Note this well)</HI> he could have the Canon pieces, which the <HI>Malayers</HI> in the Assault had found in the Fort, to be re∣stored
<PB N="21" REF="62"/>to him; but seeing that they demanded too much money for them, he would go back to <HI>Indraponra,</HI> and make report thereof to the Commander in Chief: In which it is worthy of observation, that in the foresaid <HI>Annex,</HI> belonging to the forementioned <HI>Me∣morial</HI> of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville,</HI> they say, that the same day they came to <HI>Bantam,</HI> our <HI>Ministers</HI> sent them a <HI>Protest,</HI> and withall counselled them to beware of the Malayers, with a Complaint (these are their own words) of the Injurie the English did to us, namely, in that they came to settle themselves at <HI>Batancapas,</HI> and at <HI>Indraponra</HI> also, places both appertaining to the <HI>Dutch Company,</HI> and that two dayes after our men had sent ano∣ther Protest.</P>
<P>The case then standing thus actually as is said, the question will be, from which of the two Companies, the <HI>English</HI> or the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the Action doth arise, and which of the two hath cause to complaine?</P>
<P>In case the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> had ac∣cording to their expectation, received in their Ships, that last arrived out of the <HI>East-In∣dies,</HI> all the particulars and Informations be∣longing to this matter, they would not have fayled to make their just complaints to your Puiss: Highnesses in a Methodical way; but forasmuch as the Letters of the Government of <HI>Batavia</HI> specifie, that they must first wait for the Arriral of their Ships from the West-Coast,
<PB N="22" REF="63"/>the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> must de∣fer the same, to a fitter opportunity.</P>
<P>However by what is already said, it doth sufficiently appear by what force, violence and intrusion those of the English Company have acted against us, both at <HI>Indraponra,</HI> as also at <HI>Batancapas</HI> and elsewhere, and that conse∣quently, we have abundant reason to re∣quire reparation and Satisfaction of them.</P>
<P>That which the English Company alled∣geth against this, so as it is contained in their Annex to the foresaid <HI>Memorial</HI> of the Mar∣quis of <HI>Albeville,</HI> consists in this.</P>
<P>First, the Emperour of <HI>Maniarbohaer</HI> should have conferred and setled that Coun∣trey upon them, and had to this End sent up two of his Sons to establish the English there.</P>
<P>Secondly, that they by vertue thereof ha∣ving built a Fort there, we in a time of peace had by violence assaulted them, and this only for the securing of our Traffick in Pepper.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That we had disdainfully tram∣pled upon and torn the Pavillion of the King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, That out of the Fort we had shot at the Inhabitants of <HI>Batancapas,</HI> and at them that brought their Wares to Market.</P>
<P>And lastly, that our men had rob'd and taken away all the Marchandises, Effects,
<PB N="23" REF="63"/>Silverwork, Canon, and whatever they had there.</P>
<P>What concerns the first point, it is mani∣fest, that the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> for many yeares hath had and still hath the Dominion in and over the Countreys where <HI>Batancapas</HI> is seated.</P>
<P>That this Authoritie and Dominion is now again lately in March 1686. conferred upon them with most advantagious conditions, and are thereby setled in the peaceable enjoyment thereof: So that they had not any lawful Right to instal and deliver up that Countrie into the hands of the English.</P>
<P>For as to the forementioned Emperor, whom the English stile the Emperour of <HI>Manicabo,</HI> it is true that up or in the midst of the Coun∣try of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> which are Lands of <HI>Mani∣cabo,</HI> a certain Prince or Emperour doth reign.</P>
<P>But that the Prince ever came into the lower part of this Country, and as they pretend, esta∣blished the English there, shall while the world stands, never be proved by them.</P>
<P>For it is certain, that that Emperour never hath been in those lower Countries, also in former times those Lower Countries were subjected to the usurped Authority of that Queen <HI>Seehini,</HI> whose yoak long agoe they have cast off, and given over themselves unto the Dominion of the <HI>Dutch Company,</HI> who have taken upon them to protect and defend them
<PB N="24" REF="64"/>against all Opposers whatsoever.</P>
<P>However, according to our late Letters, it is true that there appeared in these Lower Countries two young Lords, stiling them∣selves Princes, who also by some were acknow∣ledged for such, but cryed down and rejected by others as Counterfits.</P>
<P>But suppose they had been true and Law∣ful Princes, yea the very Sons of the Empe∣rour, which can never be proved, yet what right and Authority could they have to establish the English there, muchless to make over the Country unto them, or what appearance of Truth can be imagined, they should have don the same?</P>
<P>It is certain never any of the <HI>English Com∣pany</HI> have been up in those Highlands with the Emperour; no not any of Netherlandish Company themselves, notwithstanding they have lived more then fortie yeares upon the Nether-Coast.</P>
<P>That those Princes should have Order and Power from their Father to do this, is not so much as affirmed, muchless proved by the English Company it self.</P>
<P>And although it could be proved, yet it must come under examination, whether that Power and Authority could be stretched so far or not.</P>
<P>Yea be it how it will, it is enough for the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> that we according to the confession of the English themselves,
<PB N="25" REF="64"/>not only were there before them, but also that three dayes before their arrival, we had fortifyed our selves, yea as they say, upon a Rock.</P>
<P>Add to this, and which indeed is wholie de∣ciding in the subject case, that in the very Let∣ter the English produce and annexed to the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville,</HI> and to which he refers himself, it is said, that those so named Princes did declare, that in case the Hollanders should establish them∣selves at <HI>Batancapas</HI> before the English, that then the English should be frustrated there∣of. Words verie remarkable from such, by whom the English pretend to have obtained their right, espetially it being so fallen out as they said.</P>
<P>If notwithstanding the Emperor of <HI>Mani∣cabo</HI> might pretend any right to those Lands, and declare that we did keep them in our pos∣session unlawfully, which we suppose shall never be; yet then it would be a question to be decided betwixt the Emperor and us, and not with the English.</P>
<P>The second point is also without any ground of truth, to wit, that our men should have taken that Fort by violence from them, the <HI>English</HI> themselves affirm in a certain Letter, annexed to the foresaid <HI>Memorial,</HI> that our men did diverse times incite the <HI>Malbayers,</HI> and urged them to fall upon the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover that one <HI>Mechelen,</HI> whom in
<PB N="26" REF="65"/>their foresaid Annex they name <HI>Muchalon,</HI> Commander in Chief of our Men there should have said to the <HI>English,</HI> and warned them to save themselves, otherwise the <HI>Ma∣leyers</HI> would fall upon and kill them.</P>
<P>But that the English not regarding those threats, at the last our men should have commanded the <HI>Maleyers</HI> to fall upon them indeed.</P>
<P>Of which if they should be required, to bring in their proof it would be far to seek, but on the contrary, it is a certain evi∣dence that our men did endeavour their pre∣servation.</P>
<P>Hoewever we deny not, that our <HI>Maleyers,</HI> that is, such of them as remained on our side, fell upon the other, which rebelled against us, and took in the Fort they yet held in their possession.</P>
<P>It is worthy of Observation that the English themselves confefs, that not so much as a man of them was kild in that action, because we prevented our <HI>Maleyers,</HI> with all our might hindring them from doing it; but suppose it to be true, tho it be not so, that our own men had taken the fort from the English, what can be justly said against it? might we not drive them out of a Fort, which in dispite of us they erected in a Coun∣trey that belonged to us? and that right over against the Fortresse we had made there before, and after that by two Protests we had warned
<PB N="27" REF="65"/>them not to do it, but would not at all listen to us.</P>
<P>So that as instead that the English take this up a matter of Complaint and accusation a∣gainst the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> they ought to have been thankful to them for their kind and mild dealing with them; yea so far as to deliver them from eminent danger of death and ruin.</P>
<P>As one <HI>Samuel Bats,</HI> who at that time commanded the English, together with <HI>John Becton</HI> in their Letters have truely acknowledged.</P>
<P>And in case one of our Soldiers did, as they affirm in disdaing tear in peeces the <HI>Pavillion</HI> of the King of England, altho it is not true, for according to the Letters thence received, the English themselved pulled down their Flag, which surely is more likely to be true, because they apprehending the great danger they were in, would not let the Flag come into hands of their Enemies. But suppose it were don by an English Souldier, what blame can be imputed to the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> in this?</P>
<P>Why did the English expose the Flag of their King in such manner, in the Territory and Country appertaining to another? Is it not a thing known, that a strange Flag is not respected in any place whatsoever?</P>
<P>That our men, according to the contents of the fourth point, should have shot out of the
<PB N="28" REF="66"/>Fort with their Canon, is true: But it was don, not before, but after that the <HI>Rebellious Maleyers</HI> had assaulted us as Enemies.</P>
<P>And put the case they had not done it, yet are we not for this responsable to the <HI>English Company.</HI></P>
<P>Was it not free for our men to deal with them that had revolted and became Rebels, as they thought meet? Surely if we had dealt more rigourously and in an hostile manner with them, they had sufficiently deserved the same.</P>
<P>The spoiling of their goods they make men∣tion of in the fourth point, the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> denyes to have been done by their men. If it was don by the <HI>Maleyers,</HI> as in such occasions is ordinary, and therefore our State is not responsable for that, besides what∣ever we had preserved of theirs, was restored unto them again, as apperars by the foremen∣tioned Letter, in which the English com∣plain, not that our men had taken their Ca∣non, but acknowledge it was don by the <HI>Maleyers,</HI> and that it was yet in their posses∣sion.</P>
<P>If then the <HI>Maleyers</HI> could take and carrie away the Canon, how much easier was it for them to carrie away other things? So that hereby is a clear and unanswerable proof, that our people did not intermeddle with that bu∣siness, muchless that they should be guilty of the spoile made.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="66"/>
<P>And besides all this, the foresaid <HI>Bats</HI> in the forementioned Letters only desireth, that we would endeavour to get into our hands, and send him his Books and Writings, as also two men that were run away with one Moor, together what provision of meat and drink they had left, without in the least men∣tioning any other thing, as well knowing it was not remaining in our, but in the hands of <HI>Maleyers:</HI> neither is it to be imagined to have been of any great importance, for in such a place, where the inevitable danger was fore∣seen dayly by them, and where they had their Chalops and Boats, lying neer their very wals to put in whatsoever was of any worth, it is not easily to be believed, they left any thing behind them, they made any great esteem of, but only what they willingly would part with: and also whatever the <HI>Dutch Com∣pany</HI> could save, or get out of the hands of he <HI>Maleyers,</HI> was restored unto them.</P>
<P>And can these men be heard, or any be∣lief given to what was robd and taken from them was delivered into the hands of the Comman∣der in Chief of the <HI>Dutch Company,</HI> as they af∣firmatively depose in the Anaex of the <HI>Memo∣rial</HI> of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville,</HI> whereas in the <HI>Indies</HI> they not only mentioned not a word thereof, but on the contrary by their Let∣ters they declared their thanckfulness to that Commander in Chief, for the great Love
<PB N="30" REF="67"/>and Friendship he had shewed him.</P>
<P>Add to this, that when the foresaid <HI>Bats</HI> worte, that he had received the goods, he sent for in his foregoing Letters, that if there had been any thing more in our hands, would he not have desired that it might also had have bin conveyed to him? undoubtedly he would.</P>
<P>And yet they are not ashamed to alledge such frivolous things and fictions, if so be they might but by any meanes make our case odious to the world.</P>
<P>For it seemeth the <HI>English Company</HI> seekes to make it their Custom, by Complaints how ungrounded and futil soever they are to pre∣occupie, and thereby to get an advantage to the prejudice of the <HI>Dutch Companie:</HI> but we doubt but they shal fall short of their aim as in this, as they have in the business of <HI>Bantam.</HI></P>
<P>This is that which the <HI>English Company</HI> in the <HI>Memorial</HI> they delivered up do make the ground of their Complaints, affirming that the design of the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> was nothing else then by injustice, violence and oppression to ingross into their hands the whole Commerce in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and that, as they add, by continuance. But that they hope His Majesty of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> will time∣ly provide such remedies whereby such con∣tinual Intrusions, Invasions and ingrossings of the <HI>Netherlandish Companie</HI> may be pre∣vented.</P>
<P>But we would willingly know of the <HI>En∣glish
<PB N="31" REF="67"/>Company</HI> whence they gather and can make good such Inferences, that they of the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> have ever endeavoured the same: Except they have recourse to such like conclusions, as they have already pro∣duced, the ungroundedness whereof, we have nakedly and clearly demonstrated.</P>
<P>Besides it is well known that the Countries in the <HI>Indies</HI> and in <HI>Africa</HI> are so great and numerous, the districts almost infinite, that it would be a great presumption, yea folly once to imagin it, not to speak of the absolute impossibility to effect the same.</P>
<P>'Tis true (and herewith also shall be spo∣ken in Answer to the fourth point, which we reserved to this place) that the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> hath with a few unconsiderable Po∣tentates or Princes made Contracts over a Privative or Seclusive Traffick of some kind Wares which their Countries did yield. But if the <HI>English Company</HI> should maintain this to be an unlawful thing, they must condemn their own doing, and so as it were pronounce Sen∣tence against what themselves have done in former times; and of which many examples may be alledged: Now if the <HI>English Compa∣ny</HI> hath made such contracts, sometimes with∣out, and sometimes together with us, when we were in a nearer League Anno 1619. and some years following, as may be seen and will appear in the <HI>Publick Testimonies Wri∣tings</HI> lying by us.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="68"/>
<P>And when the <HI>English Company</HI> had such Contracts with us together, then according to their sentiment, it was lawful and good. But now the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> doth the same without them, as having no communion or fellowship in the least with them in the <HI>Indies,</HI> it is condemned and exclaimed against by them, as being unreasonable: Ought they not to call to memorie, that in former times the English Marchants had the whole Traf∣fick of the <HI>Caveyaer</HI> which <HI>Rusland</HI> or <HI>Musco∣via</HI> did yield.</P>
<P>And to come yet closer to them, have they not made in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and yet dayly seek to make such Contracts, especially on the Coast of <HI>Malabaer?</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> hath ere∣cted here and there some Forts for the security of their Trade, and also to make the People of those Countries to stand to the Contracts made with them, cannot be imputed a Crime to the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> or the <HI>English Company</HI> must confess themselves guiltie of the said crime, for they also have made Forts for the same end at <HI>Boucoulo</HI> and <HI>Indraponra,</HI> and moreover endeavoured to do the like at <HI>Batancapas,</HI> with what face then can the <HI>En∣glish Company</HI> blame us in this? and lay it as a grat evil to our charge, whereas they them∣selves at <HI>Priaman</HI> (being on the West-Coast of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> a Country under the subjection
<PB N="33" REF="68"/>of the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> and where they had a Fortresse) not only intended, but even actually took in hand to settle themselves, yea also according to the Octroy or Charter granted them by the King now reigning, as to other things, so in special to build a Royal Fortress, fortifyed with 40 great Peeces of Ca∣non, Magasins, Wharfs for Shipping, and all other Houses and Buildings, there to e∣rect a <HI>Court of Justice</HI> and <HI>Admiralty,</HI> and henceforward there to regulate and govern themselves after the same manner, that the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> (these are their verie terms) are wont to do in their places, com∣manding them that in the Building of that great and Royal Fort, they should well pro∣vide for the security of their men, not only a∣gainst the mutinous People of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> but also (which is not to be passed by without a Nota bene) against their outlandish Enemies, the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>For however that design of theirs was not effected, because the English coming there with their Ships, found that the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> themselves had a Fort there, so that had they gon forward, they saw it must be by falling upon us in a hostile way, and drive us from thence, which in appearance they dared not, yet to attempt: may we not here∣upon justly demand, whether if they of the <HI>En∣glish Company</HI> having attained to their desired intent, as to that City would not have kept
<PB N="34" REF="69"/>it alone to themselves, and whether they would have suffered us to trade together with them there? For then the Fortress built at such excessive charges in that City would have been of no use or benefit, but a burthen only.</P>
<P>But in case they now had near <HI>Priaman</HI> by force of Arms compelled some of those Princes thereabout, or that any of them had of their own free will submitted to the <HI>English Com∣pany,</HI> (for there are diverse Princes and Peo∣ples, who have every one apart their Jurisdic∣tions and Command, and for many years since submitted themselves to us) if I say, they should by force of Armes overcom any of the said Princes, or if any of them should willingly, and of their own accord submit to the said <HI>Eng∣glish Company,</HI> and make privative or seclusive Contracts with them, tho perhaps they had not built any Forts in the Countrie, and that the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> would thereupon intrude themselves, and deprive the English of their intrest, by building a Fortresse, to hinder them from enjoying the Fruits and Benefits of the Contracts made with those Nations: might not in such a case the English justly have opposed us, yea driven us away by force? un∣doubtly they mought.</P>
<P>If then it deserve to be judged injustice, vio∣lence and oppression in us, by lawful means to seek in one and the other Countrie out of or beyond <HI>Europe,</HI> to get and appropriate to our selves the Trade thereof: Then we know
<PB N="35" REF="69"/>not, how possibly the English can be judged blameless, considering what they have don in <HI>Carolina, Virginia, New-England, Jamaica,</HI> and elsewhere, Countries of that vast extent, that all what the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> doth pos∣sess in <HI>East-Indies,</HI> is not to be compared thereunto.</P>
<P>And in case it be lawful to be don there, why then may it not be don by the <HI>Dutch Company</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies?</HI> except that it can be de∣monstrated, that the Rights of the <HI>West-Indies</HI> and the <HI>East-Indies</HI> are not of the same nature.</P>
<P>But to remain only within the bounds of the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> The <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> would fain know, upon what account <HI>Sillebaer, Bon∣coulo, Indraponra, &amp;c.</HI> were taken and pos∣sessed by the English? to what end they erected Forts there? especialy if their design at <HI>Pria∣man</HI> had succeeded, was it not to draw and appropriate unto them the Commerce of Pep∣per, as much as they could? They endea∣voured to make and fortifie <HI>Priaman</HI> in such a manner, for so their Orders runs, that they might be in a posture to withstand the <HI>Hollan∣ders,</HI> whom they term, their Enemies.</P>
<P>If then the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> be thus lookt upon by them, it is no wonder, their Ministers and Servants in the <HI>Indies</HI> labour to do us all the spite, mischief and injury they pos∣sibly can.</P>
<P>Whereas on the contrarie our men, accord∣ing to the Letters which from time to time
<PB N="36" REF="70"/>we receive thence, endeavour nothing more, then to please and condescend to them in all things, according to the order which our States do continually give unto us: hereby al∣so, were it possible, to free your Puiss: High∣nesses from further Complaints and Molesta∣tions, with which your Puiss: Highnesses are so often disturbed by the English: but the greater condescention we have used and la∣bored to shew unto them, what advantages and quiet soever we endeavoured to procure, what affronts soever we past by, all is but labor lost, and the successive Letters we receive from the <HI>Indies</HI> testifie, is as Oyl cast into the fire, and only makes them the more audacious and fierce aganst us.</P>
<P>And had we at the first at <HI>Indraponra,</HI> stoutly opposed and hindred them from settling them∣selves there, to which we had an indisputable Right, they would not have ventured to have undertaken, what they did at <HI>Batancapas,</HI> and the troubles thereon ensuing would have been prevented, our condescention and indul∣gence being the only occasion they abused thereunto.</P>
<P>If at any time infraction or injustice hath bin committed, they must have recourse to what happened in the business on the West-Coast, of which the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> hopes after some time to make full discoverie to your Puiss: Highnesses.</P>
<P>However this is underniable that our Men
<PB N="37" REF="70"/>now lately at <HI>Bengale</HI> did the English a signal service, for when they were in a great extremi∣tie, and the Moors had deprived them of all meanes of Livelyhood, then by our mediation and intervention the business was brought to a cessation of all acts of hostility for a time: so far was it from our intent to plot, or cause any harm to come to them, for if it had bin so, ne∣ver fairer opportunity was put into the hands of any, then in that business of <HI>Bengale,</HI> wherein the English, besides the loss of Hundreds of their men, would have sustained irreparable dammage in their Estates and occasions.</P>
<P>At <HI>Batavia</HI> we took them into us, without in the least being obliged thereto, there we harbored them a long time, we permitted their Ships coming in and going out, to enjoy all manner of necessaries and refreshments, notwithstanding all the continual nastinesses and pilfrings of their men; yea those very Ships which came from the West-Coast in that mi∣serable and desolate condition, and where they had dealt so inhumanely with our men, as hath bin related, yet we provided them not onely with whatever they needed, but also let them them repair, and new build them again upon our Wharfs.</P>
<P>In case the Subjects of our Stase should com to request such a thing of them in the <HI>Caribes, Barbados, Virgina, Jamaica,</HI> or other places, they not only would not have admitted, but rather seased and confiscated them. The same
<PB N="38" REF="71"/>usage also in likelihood, we might expect from them at <HI>Madraspatnam,</HI> or their Fort S. <HI>Georg,</HI> where as hath be said, they have setled them∣selves on the Coast of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> or at least would send us packing away from thence.</P>
<P>Their Ship the Royal <HI>James</HI> coming in Sept. 1686. from <HI>England,</HI> and arriving at <HI>Priaman,</HI> with the loss of about 40. Mariners and 30. Soldiers, together with all their Chief Officers unto the verie last Sergeant they had, in expe∣ctation to have found there a Royal Factorie, but in stead thereof meeting with our Men, and departing from thence, at their earnest re∣quest, we furnished them with all manner of refreshments, they pleading that because the season was wel past they entended to sail to <HI>Padang</HI> in <HI>Bengale,</HI> but in stead thereof, they stiered their cours to <HI>Indraponra,</HI> where they knew there was nothing to be found for them, save men, ammonition and such like necessaries for War, with which they provided themselves the better to maintain the place against us.</P>
<P>Their Ship the <HI>Herbert,</HI> beeing arrived before <HI>Batavia,</HI> some of their men came into the Citie with Pocket Pistols, and pickt a quarrel in their Lodging in the night, and making use of their Pistols, they were by the assistance of the People and Magistrates Ser∣vants disarmed, their Pistols by force taken away, otherwise it had undoubtedly cost much Blood, and so these impudent men were chased out of the Citie.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="71"/>
<P>And besides some other Ships, the 1. of De∣cember of the last yea, there arrived at <HI>Cochin,</HI> a Citie belonging to the <HI>Netherlandish Com∣pany</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Mallabaer,</HI> a certain En∣glish Fregat (named <HI>Madras,</HI> and the Captain <HI>John Wallis,</HI> comming from <HI>Cormandel,</HI> being bound for <HI>Suratta,</HI> who after he got fresh Victuals and Water, and was without being taken notice of, come abord, he entreprised in the night time with a boat propt with men to enter a certain Moors Ship, who som dayes before as come from <HI>Suratta</HI> into that <HI>Rode,</HI> he throughly searched the same, while that 15. Musquetiers with their Cocks bent lay in rea∣diness near unto them, and required the <HI>Tan∣del</HI> or Boatsman (the Master then being on Land at <HI>Coehin</HI>) to shew him his Pasport, who affirming that he had it not, took him along with him out of his Ship, and having brought him a bord his own, with much threatning commanded him to fetch his Pas from Land, but when the said Boatsman was returned from Land, he saw that the foresaid English∣man was departed, after he thus used vio∣lence in the Rode, where all ought to be in the greatest securitie.</P>
<P>Again, on the fourth of the said moneth there arrived at <HI>Cochin</HI> for the same end an English Schip called <HI>Carolus Secundus,</HI> mounted with 60 Guns and about threehundred men, <HI>Mari∣ners</HI> and <HI>Soldiers,</HI> having near 50 dead and 80 sick persons after he was come from England
<PB N="40" REF="72"/>the foregoing May: and notwithstanding it was remonstrated, and complaints made to the Captain <HI>Jonathan Andrews</HI> of the in∣jurie and violence he did to our Companie, yet he was not ashamed to pretend a right to visit a Moors Ship in our Rode, come hither from <HI>Suratta,</HI> upon the pretext that in the said Moors Ship there were English Fugitives, however he was at last perswaded to desist.</P>
<P>Now in case one or more Ships of the <HI>Ne∣therlandish Company</HI> should undertake in the Rhode of <HI>Madraspatnam,</HI> a Citie as hath bin said, belonging to the English <HI>East-Indies Company,</HI> to visit, search and deal with them after the same manner the English have done in our Rodes, what horrid Exclamations would they not make throughout Europe about it? What pretences of injuries, affronts and dammages would they not divulge? And yet this is the verie thing they dare to enter∣prise in our Rodes and Rivers.</P>
<P>They complain of Infraction, Wrong, In∣justice offred them: But if ever any wrong or injustice hath been done, it is apparently to be seen in this, and in a matter of such tenderness and consequence.</P>
<P>We passe by in silence, that the English have endeavoured, and yet continue dayly to debauch and intice our men by money to de∣sert us and enter into their service, witnesse what they do at <HI>Bengale,</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Cor∣mandel, Suratta,</HI> and elsewhere, neither have
<PB N="41" REF="72"/>we ever been able to make them to desist from these their continued practises for so many years successively, by all the Protestations and Complaints made and delivered up unto them: And in case we feared not to be overtrouble∣som to your Puiss. Highnesses in the rehearsal of many other matters and transactions, whereby the greatest wrong and injustice ima∣ginable hath been offred us: The <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> could more amply enlarge and extend these things. But with the permission of your Puiss: Highnesses we shall reserve the same to another opportunity.</P>
