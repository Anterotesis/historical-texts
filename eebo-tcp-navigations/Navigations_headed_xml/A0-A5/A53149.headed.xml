<P>The Desperate heathens takeing advantage of the dismission of three Disbanded Companies, studied nothing but Massacres out∣rages, and trecherous hostillitie, which within two days after those said Companies were dispers't they found opportunity to commit in a Town called <HI>Nas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>away</HI> which they set fire to and burnt to t e Ground taking no less than 55 Persons into their Merciless captivity, and because the reader shall understand the Damnable antipathy they have to Religion and Piety, I would have him take notice how they endeavour to Signallize their Cruelty and grati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie their enraged Spleen chiefly on the promoters of it; for of these 55 Captives the Minister of the Towns relations made no less then 19 of them <HI>viz.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son</HI> the Ministers wife and three of his Children, her sister and sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hildren, and her sister <HI>Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w</HI> and four Children.

<P>In short, their outrages are so many and different, that I must intreat the reader since they will not be brought into afluent Narration, to accept them plainly and dyurnully according to the time, place, and manner as they were committed, which is the only way to avoid omissions, and consequently to Satisfie the in∣quisitive, who I suppose would willingly hear of all the extremi∣ties have happened to the suffering Christians in this New <HI>En∣gland</HI> War.</P>

<P>At <HI>Mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>row</HI> on the 12th Ditto, were several houses burnt whilst the miserable inhabitants were at a meeting, and at <HI>Spring∣field</HI> the same Lords day, these devillish Enemies of Religion see∣ing a man, woman, and their Children, going but towards a meet∣ing-house, Slew them (as they said) because they thought they In∣tended to go thither.</P>
