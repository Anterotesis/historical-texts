<HEAD>A JOURNAL OF THE War with <HI>Holland,</HI> From His Majesties departure from <HI>Paris,</HI> until his return.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">According to the order of Action and Time.</HEAD>
<P>THE States of Holland were raised in a short time to such a pitch of Pride and Insolence, that 'twas impossible they should maintain it long. Their Irreligion was so great, that Heaven could no more be deaf to the just complaints of the Oppressed. They were so blind, as to take no notice of the Favors of that Monarch, who had, as it were, raised them out of nothing: and they pretended to give Law to those Powers,
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>from whom, not long before, they had had petition'd to receive it. In fine, their Am∣bition, their Tyranny, and their Ingrati∣tude did exceed all bounds: and they were so puft up with the thoughts of being Princes, and understood withal so little what Soveraignty was, that they imagined all the World ought to stoop and pay Obe∣dience to them.</P>
<P>There was then a necessity that some one or other should charitably interpose to dis∣abuse them; and none could undertake that Work more effectually, then our Great Mo∣narch. That care was his particular concern, and none had so great an Interest in it as Himself. He had the Power, and nothing was wanting but a Will; which he is always rea∣dy to exert, whensoever so just an occasion offers it self. As being <HI>The most Christian King,</HI> He was obliged to undertake the de∣fence of the Church: as one that had raised them, 'twas His Interest to chastise their In∣gratitude▪ and as being the most absolute Monarch in the World, it became His glory to maintain His Soveraignty. 'Twas this that obliged Him to declare War, and to put Himself at the head of a Hundred thou∣sand Men, to teach them such Lessons, as they should never forget.</P>
<P>His Majesty parted from S. <HI>Germains,</HI> on
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>Thursday the 28. of April, in the Year 1672, and having taken the way of <HI>Soissons,</HI> He arrived at <HI>Rocroy</HI> the second of May en∣suing, where the Troops, that were to com∣pose his Army, began to <HI>rendevouz;</HI> as those, which were to make an Army for Monsieur the Prince, did at <HI>Sedan.</HI></P>
<P>The same day we came also to <HI>Rocroy,</HI> by the way of <HI>Fymes, Rheimes,</HI> and <HI>Retel.</HI></P>
<P>The third of May in the Morning, His Majesty parted with all His Forces from <HI>Rocroy,</HI> and came to <HI>Mariemburg,</HI> where we were scarcely encamped, but he command∣ed the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> to advance towards <HI>Philipville;</HI> which we presently did, and found there several Troops.</P>
<P>The fourth, His Majesty came to <HI>Philip∣ville,</HI> and we, with the Troops that we found there, marched to <HI>Charleroy,</HI> where all the Army gathered into a Body, during seven or eight days that His Majesty resided there.</P>
<P>The fifth, the King arrived at <HI>Charleroy:</HI> And having had intelligence, that 3000 Horse and 600 Foot were march'd out of <HI>Maestricht,</HI> and run along the <HI>Meuse,</HI> with design to plunder the Boats that brought our Provisions from <HI>Huy</HI> to <HI>Leige;</HI> and that they were come up to the Gates of <HI>Huy,</HI> and being denyed entrance there, had threatned
<PB N="26" REF="15"/>to pillage and burn the Town, unless the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would thrust out our Commissaries: Ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were dispatched 2500 Horse, and 200 Dra¦goons, under the Command of Monsieu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Chevalier <HI>de Fourille.</HI> Thereupon w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> marched to <HI>Gyblou,</HI> and in our way gave a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> alarm to <HI>Namur,</HI> which thought we wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coming to besiege it.</P>
<P>The sixth, whil'st His Majesty stayed a <HI>Charleroy,</HI> where his Army increased ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> day; we encamped at <HI>Bonneff.</HI></P>
<P>The seventh, we marched to <HI>Mosey.</HI></P>
<P>The eighth, His Majesty tarryed still a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Charleroy,</HI> and we thought to have continu¦ed our Quarters at <HI>Mosey:</HI> But about 9 i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the morning, the Commissaries, that ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> care of the Provisions at <HI>Huy,</HI> came an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> acquainted Monsieur <HI>de Fourille,</HI> that they could not convoy the Provisions with safety unless we advanced up to the Passage Whereupon we chang'd our design, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> marching towards the Gates of <HI>Huy,</HI> en¦camped in a Meddow over against the Vil¦lage of <HI>Chouquiere,</HI> at the foot of the Castle of <HI>Berloc,</HI> upon the edge of the <HI>Meuse,</HI> a¦bout the mid-way between <HI>Huy</HI> and <HI>Liege<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> where the Enemy two days before had re∣fresh'd themselves, and plundered the Boats We learnt, notwithstanding, that they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in so great fear, that their Horse had take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="27" REF="15"/>the alarm at the arrival of their Foot, who could not come up so soon; and that mista∣king their own Forces, and thinking them to have been French Troops, they had se∣cured themselves by flight, if some had not run and acquainted them with the mistake. At length our Provisions passed on guarded with 100 Horse, that marched along the River on the left hand, and secured with a 100 Dragoons, that were placed at the ave∣nues on the right hand: and being arrived over against the Castle and our Camp, the Guard of Dragoons was made to enter the Boats, and that of the Horse was doubled, which marched all night as far as <HI>Leige,</HI> and returned again.</P>
<P>The ninth in the Morning, we went back, and encamped at <HI>Fallais,</HI> a Village of <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bant,</HI> belonging to the Spaniards, where Monsieur the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> joyned with us, who came thither about ten in the Morning with a Guard of 500 Horse; and afterwards about three in the Afternoon parted from us with 120 Horse, and went to <HI>Leige.</HI> The Enemy now began to shut themselves up, and issued out no more in a great Body, but only as Pickeerers, 12, 15, or 20 in a Company, and killed a Quarter∣master, and six of the Horse men that guard∣ed Monsieur the Marquis <HI>de Louvois,</HI> and
<PB N="28" REF="16"/>had tarryed a little behind the rest. The same Evening two others, who had bin foraging in a Village, were killed by the Enemy, who had hid themselves, and pretended they were Spaniards, belonging to some of the Spanish Garrisons.</P>
<P>The tenth, we march'd to <HI>Bierzey,</HI> and came near again to <HI>Leige.</HI> The same day Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> left the King (who tar∣ryed still at <HI>Charleroy</HI>) and advanced with one part of the Troops, of which he formed an Army for himself. The Troops that had convoy'd Monsieur <HI>de Louvois,</HI> rejoin'd with us, and he himself tarryed at <HI>Leige.</HI></P>
<P>The eleventh, Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> con∣tinued his march, and we stayed at <HI>Bierzey.</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Louvois</HI> sent word, that we should dispatch in the Evening a hundred Dragoons to guard them along; w<SUP>ch</SUP> Monsieur the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> sent him. In the mean time Monsieur the Prince marched slowly on with his Army on the other side of the <HI>Meuse,</HI> on the right hand.</P>
<P>The twelfth in the morning, Monsieur the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> returned from <HI>Leige,</HI> and we being joyned with the Army of Mon∣sieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> went to encamp at <HI>Greville</HI> near <HI>Tongren,</HI> which we took without re∣sistance, and placed a Garrison in it. Mon∣sieur the Count <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> came to us from
<PB N="29" REF="16"/><HI>Huy,</HI> where he had bin before.</P>
<P>The thirteenth, Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> staid at <HI>Greville,</HI> but he sent away the Foot Regi∣ments of <HI>Alsace</HI> and <HI>Languedoc,</HI> that made six Bodies, three Companies of Dragoons of the Regiment <HI>Royall,</HI> that came to 300 men, the Horse Regiments <HI>de Joyeuse, de Tury, de Gassion, de S. Loup, de Rouville,</HI> and some others. This party was commanded by Monsieur the Count <HI>de Chamilly.</HI> After∣wards we went to <HI>Bilsem.</HI></P>
<P>The fourteenth, we went and encamped at <HI>Rakem,</HI> which lies two Leagues on the other side of <HI>Maestrickt,</HI> and within one of <HI>Maesiick.</HI> M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> followed us with his Army; and the King marched another way near <HI>Vizè,</HI> 2 Leagues above <HI>Maestricht.</HI> The 15. in the morning, we came up within sight of <HI>Maisiich,</HI> where the army being drawn up, M. the Count <HI>de Chamilly</HI> summon'd the Town, which not seeming averse to a Parley, he went in, but they not agreeing upon Conditions, command was given to prepare Faggots, and we began to raise a Battery for four pieces of Canon; and not staying to throw up Trenches, some Com∣panies of Foot were drawn out, and com∣manded to come up under the shelter of some thick Hedges, and old Walls which lay near the Town-ditch. All this was done by two in the Afternoon, and then we began
<PB N="30" REF="17"/>to play upon the Town, which did the like upon us. They held out about five hours, and defended themselves well enough. In this Action we lost in all but one or two Of∣ficers, and some few common Soldiers, and the Enemy had not above 3 or 4 men killed: but notwithstanding, about 7 of the Clock they beat a Parley, and denr'd to Treat; whereupon the Count <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> and the <HI>Sieur de Ranes</HI> went in again, and came not back till the Town was surrendred; and in the mean time, the Chevalier <HI>du Plessis,</HI> Camp Marshal to the Army, commanded the Attaque.</P>
<P>But before this, not imagining the Place would, have yielded so soon, advice was given thereof to Mareshal <HI>Turenne,</HI> who thereupon advanced, and was very near when the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> took Horse and left the Town, which had just now yielded, to advertise him of it. Whereupon he made a halt, and encamp'd with his Army pretty near ours, and himself retir'd into one of the M. <HI>de Ranes</HI>'s Houses, who went back imme∣diatly into the Town to Count <HI>de Chamilly</HI> and thence they both return'd to <HI>Marsha Turenne.</HI> This Action gave occasion to some Dutch Railery, who thereupon told that the French had taken <HI>Maestricht,</HI> no no, I mis∣take would they say, 'tis <HI>Maesiick:</HI> but this was the last time they were in a ralling hu∣mor;
<PB N="31" REF="17"/>for since then we have dealt with them in such earnest, that they have not had time to bethink themselves, or give their minds to so much relaxation, as to be in a fit of drol∣ling or playing the <HI>Satyrists.</HI></P>
<P>The sixteenth, we left the <HI>Sieur Chamilly</HI> at <HI>Maesiick</HI> with his Troops, and Monsieur <HI>du Plessis,</HI> to see to the fortifying of the Place. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> coasted along the River towards <HI>Maestricht</HI> with three Companies of Dragoons, and took all the Boats he met with, to the number of 25, and had them all brought back up the River to the Abby of <HI>Ocq,</HI> where we were by that time encamped, and where at our coming we found Monsieur <HI>Vaubrun</HI> Camp Marshal, with a part of the Army which he there com∣manded.</P>
<P>The 17<SUP>th</SUP> in the Morning, we left that Par∣ty to the conduct of Monsieur <HI>Vaubrun</HI> their Commander, and march'd with some Guides to <HI>Vizè,</HI> whether His Majesty came also the same day; but in our March, coming with∣in Canon shot of <HI>Maestricht,</HI> there issued out thence some Horse, one part of which seem'd to turn off towards Monsieur <HI>Van∣brun</HI>'s Camp, and the other to advance to∣wards us. The <HI>Sieurs T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>renne,</HI> and <HI>de Ranes,</HI> made up towards them, but they thereupon nimbly retir'd, the Enemy only letting fly 30 or 40 Canon, and some volleys of small
<PB N="32" REF="18"/>Shot at us, which did no harm. A League from thence, we met the Count <HI>de Lorge</HI> with his flying Army, who had encamp'd hard by, upon the way to <HI>Tongres:</HI> He drew near likewise to <HI>Maestricht,</HI> and beset it closely on his side, as Monsieur <HI>de Vaubrun</HI> had on the other.</P>
<P>The 18. the King went to take a view of the out-works of the <HI>Fort ...</HI> w<SUP>ch</SUP> belongs to the Spaniard, and lies on the right from the <HI>Meuse,</HI> near a League from <HI>Vizè,</HI> and two from <HI>Maestricht:</HI> he was saluted by the Garrison, which is always very strong, with many great Guns, and volleys of small shot,</P>
<P>The 19. Monsieur the Prince encamped within two Leagues of us, and came the same day with Monsieur the Duke, to visit the King; and afterwards (having first been at Council) return'd to his Camp.</P>
<P>The 20. the Kings Army, as also that of the Prince, rested.</P>
<P>The 21. They rested again, and a Bridge of Boats was begun upon the <HI>Meuse</HI> below <HI>Vizè.</HI> Monsieur <HI>Vaubrun</HI> went and joyned his Troops to those of Monsieur <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> who have since been employ'd, almost du∣ring all the rest of the Campaigne, in forti∣fying <HI>Maseick,</HI> and in coursing about <HI>Ma∣stricht.</HI></P>
<PB N="33" REF="18"/>
<P>The 22. they continued working about the Bridge, which was well forwarded. The same day the Prince's Army march'd.</P>
<P>The twenty third, His Majesty rested again, the Bridge was finish'd, and the <HI>Collonel</HI> Regiment of Dragoons left <HI>Vizè</HI> to go and joyn with the Army of Monsieur the Prince, under whom it serv'd during the rest of the Campaigne. Three Companies of the Regiment <HI>Royall,</HI> which had been left about <HI>Maestricht,</HI> came back. The heavy bag∣gage past the River all that day. In the e∣vening some were drawn out of the Kings <HI>Houshold</HI> to go and get Intelligence of the Enemy toward <HI>Maestricht:</HI> it fell to the lot of the Marquis of <HI>Saurebeuf,</HI> a younger Brother, one of the Kings Guards, to be first pick'd out to go, and see what might be discover'd at the Pallisado. He brought back word to the Brigadier of Musque∣teers who commanded the Party, that he had seen a Sentinel without the Pallisado, and within many lighted matches, which made him think it was well man'd. The Commander not being satisfied with this ac∣count, told him, That would not serve his turn, and that the King would know whe∣ther any body had gone out of the place or no, wherefore he must return and do his utmost to learn that; which he presently did, and going streight to the Sentinel, ask'd
<PB N="34" REF="19"/>him, If the Party that went out that day, were yet return'd; to which, he receiv'd no other answer then a Musket-shot in his throat, that was followed by at least forty more, which however mist him; but the first wound was in so dangerous a place, that he immediatly fell, and was altogether una∣ble to make his Escape; so that the Enemies carryed him into the Town, where he was long kept Prisoner and ill of his wound.</P>
<P>The 24. His Majesty pass'd the <HI>Maes</HI> upon the bridge of Boats, with the whole Army, except only Five hundred Foot, which were drawn out by lot to be left in Garrison at <HI>Vizè,</HI> a little Town lying on the right side of the <HI>Maes,</HI> between <HI>Maestricht</HI> and <HI>Liege;</HI> so we went and encamp'd at <HI>Biernaw</HI> upon the little River <HI>Berwine,</HI> in the Coun∣try of <HI>Limbourg.</HI> The same day in the morn∣ing, Monsieur the Vicount of <HI>Turenne,</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> march'd with some Horse and Dragoons to the Fort call'd <HI>Fou∣quemont,</HI> (otherwise <HI>Fauquenton,</HI> or <HI>Valkem∣borg.</HI>) This is a Castle three hours Journey from <HI>Macstricht,</HI> on the other side of the Ri∣ver, built on a steep Rock; at the Foot of which there is a great Town, bearing the same name, and depending on it. There was in it a Garrison for the Hollander, but upon notice of the march of the foresaid
<PB N="35" REF="19"/>Persons, they retir'd into <HI>Maestricht,</HI> and quitted the Castle, though it be inaccessible and impregnable without Canon. There are within it Caves of a Prodigious depth and bigness, wherein a whole Army might be hid: there was little Provision in it, for which reason the Sieur <HI>de la Roüillardiere,</HI> Captain of a Company of Dragoons, who was left there with One hundred men, was forc'd to buy some from the Town, and o∣ther neighboring places; the King having ordered, That he should take nothing but what was paid for.</P>
<P>The 25. His Majesty rested.</P>
<P>The 26. the Kings Army still rested, and nothing extraordinary passed. Monsieur the Prince still march'd forward toward the <HI>Rhine,</HI> upon the resolution which had been taken not to set upon <HI>Maestricht,</HI> but to go straight on and take the places which lie a∣long that River, and so drive straight for∣wards into Holland.</P>
<P>The 27. at night, the Weather grew very bad, and in the morning it was very cloudy and louring, but we departed notwithstand∣ing, and came to <HI>Willers,</HI> where the Rain did not a little incommode us.</P>
<P>The 28. The Weather being good a∣gain, the King went and encamp'd at <HI>Rolduc,</HI> and upon some Intelligence, a Coun∣cil
<PB N="36" REF="20"/>was call'd, where it was resolv'd, That Monsieur <HI>Turenne</HI> should march on with 15000, or 16000 men, which he did: but this Order not having been foreseen, many of those who were commanded to accom∣pany him having march'd before, went on with the Kings Army, till being told of their duty, they were forc'd to march all night to overtake the Army of Monsieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who went and encamp'd at <HI>Erkelens.</HI></P>
<P>The 29. the King came within half a League of <HI>Juliers,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> encamp'd at <HI>Telns,</HI> a little Village between <HI>Nuis</HI> and <HI>Keiserwort,</HI> in the Country of <HI>Co∣len.</HI> The same day the Prince's Army pass'd the <HI>Rhine</HI> upon a certain Float of Wood, w<SUP>ch</SUP> carryed 2000 Foot and 200 Horse, with all their baggage at a time: and his Highness and the Duke of <HI>Newbourg</HI> treated them so well at their arrival at <HI>Keiserwort,</HI> that they were all very merry, which yet hinder'd not the Duke of <HI>Newbourg</HI> from coming in the Evening to see Monsieur de <HI>Turenne,</HI> and to invite him to Dinner the next day.</P>
<P>The 30. We stayed at <HI>Telns.</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> dined with the Duke of <HI>New∣bourg,</HI> and in the Evening at his return he had 96 Prisoners brought him, sent by Mon∣sieur <HI>de Montal,</HI> Governor of <HI>Charleroy,</HI> who commanding a Party of our Troops, had
<PB N="37" REF="20"/>fallen into an Ambush of theirs, and with five or six more had born up against all their Firing, amongst whom <HI>Monsieur the Che∣valier de Marsillac</HI> was mortally wounded. In the mean time, forty Dragoons lighted off their Horses, and with 30 Musqueteers, did so bestir themselves, that before the Enemy could make a second discharge, they had quite routed them, kill'd eleven, and took their Commander (who defended him∣self so manfully, that they were forced to use him worse then they desir'd) with all the rest, excepting 2 or 3 who at first betook themselves to their heels. Afterwards, the Ca∣ptain being known by some of the Officers of our Party, had quarter given him; &amp; be∣ing not yet dead, all possible means were us'd to save his Life. He was carryed off in∣to a Castle, where Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> sent him his own Chirurgion, but to little pur∣pose, for he dyed soon after. The rest of the Prisoners were brought to <HI>Nuis,</HI> where Mon∣sieur <HI>de Strasbourg</HI> arriv'd the same day, and was saluted with the great Guns of the Town.</P>
<P>The 31. in the Morning, Monsieur <HI>de Tu∣renne</HI> took with him a party of the <HI>Corps de Guard,</HI> all the Light Guards of the Kings Houshold, three Companies of the Regi∣ment <HI>Royall</HI> of Dragoons, a part of the Re∣giment
<PB N="38" REF="21"/>of the French Guards, and some Light Horse; who, after having winter'd in the Country of <HI>Colen,</HI> came by order of His Majesty to encamp and intrench them∣selves upon the banks of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> on the left side near <HI>Keiserwort,</HI> where they encamped &amp; fortified themselves very commodiously. Afterwards we march'd all day, and en∣camp'd under a great Hill above <HI>Orsoy.</HI> The King march'd on to <HI>Nuys,</HI> and Monsieur the Prince advanc'd by the side of him in equal marches.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>June,</HI> the King left <HI>Nuys</HI> and besieg'd <HI>Orsoy,</HI> a little Town of a reasonable strength, situate on the left side of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> As soon as His Majesty came before it, He caus'd it to be summon'd, but the Governor refusing to yield it up, we were immediatly employ'd about making of Faggots, and put∣ing our selves into a condition to attaque it.</P>
<P>The next day Monsieur the Prince came before <HI>Wezel,</HI> and did that day only encamp and invest the Town, which seem'd strong and considerable enough to make us pro∣ceed cautiously in our attaque. <HI>Wezel</HI> is a very great Town, situate on the right side of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> at the Mouth of the River <HI>Lyppe.</HI> It hath a great Ditch fac'd with good brick, and is divided in the middle by a great Trench, and very good Fortifications, so that
<PB N="39" REF="21"/>if one half of the Town were gain'd, one should be put to the trouble of a Siege to get the other. Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> with whom we were, came before <HI>Burick,</HI> which we invested; and after the Camp was setled, he sent for some Foot to raise a Redout between this Town and <HI>Wezel,</HI> which are over-against one the other, on each side the <HI>Rhine. Burick</HI> is two good Musket-shot di∣stant from it, but not so far, but that they might give one another mutual assistance. For this reason it was thought necessary to make this Redout, as well to hinder their communication, as to cut off the Passage between <HI>Burick</HI> and the River, from whence the Enemy might have mischiev'd us in the Trenches, which we were about to begin on the other side, so to make our approaches to <HI>Wezel.</HI> At the same time we were employ'd in raising a Battery on the bank of the Ri∣ver, to hinder the Dutch Vessels going to and fro upon the River, and assisting the Be∣sieg'd. At our first coming thither we took two of them, which we mann'd with Dra∣goons, and plac'd in the middle of the River. The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> who command∣ed the French Troops belonging to the Bishops of <HI>Colen</HI> and <HI>Munster,</HI> besieg'd <HI>Lokem.</HI></P>
<PB N="40" REF="22"/>
<P>The second, the King commanded an As∣sault to be given to <HI>Orsoy,</HI> whereupon we presently made our selves Masters of the Counterscarpe, and gain'd all the out-works, which made the Governor desire to come to composition; but no other Articles being of∣fer'd, but, That the Garrison should surren∣der themselves upon discretion, He would not hear of that: so the King sent him back, threatning, That if they discharg'd but one Canon more, He would have no mercy on them. But this hinder'd not their firing much more freely then they had don before, which greatly incens'd the King. Monsieur the Prince caus'd the Fort of <HI>Lippe</HI> to be at∣taqued that Evening, which was carryed by the Count <HI>de Nogent</HI> by Assault. This very much terrified those of <HI>Wezel,</HI> because that Fort was near, and did in some manner com∣mand the place. The Governor was there kill'd, with his Pike in his hand.</P>
<P>In Monsieur <HI>Turenne</HI>'s Army, they were all busied in making their Lines of Circum∣vallation, and blocking up the Town. The Battery, begun the day before upon the bank of the River, was finish'd, and nine pieces of Ordnance mounted on it. Monsieur the Prince raised also another on his side of the River, consisting of 6 Pieces; and in the E∣vening we were busied in repairing the Re∣doute,
<PB N="41" REF="22"/>which had been almost beat down that day by the Guns of the two Towns.</P>
<P>The third, <HI>Orsoy</HI> yielded. For the Gover∣nor seeing himself unable to make any long∣er resistance, was fled with his Family, and all that was most dear to him, in a small Vessel, designing to gain <HI>Rhineberg;</HI> but His Majesty having intelligence of it, and being incens'd against him for his stubbornness, caus'd the Canon to play so hard upon him, that at last, seeing one of his Wives Wo∣men cut off in the middle by a Canon shot, he was forc'd to come ashore, and yield him∣self up to the mercy of the Conquerors. The Plunder of the Castle was given to the Soldiery, and the Garrison made Prisoners at discretion. The chief Persons whom we lost in the Action, were the <HI>Sieur de Valens,</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>D'Arquien,</HI> which last was kill'd by a Canon-shot near the Kings Per∣son, who presently afterwards commanded <HI>Rhineburg</HI> to be invested. At the Prince's Army, the whole day was spent in parlying, for the Inhabitants would by no means hear of standing it out; and the Garrison, tho finding themselves so weak as not to be able to undertake any thing, could not resolve to yield themselves upon discretion, so that the whole day pass'd without any Action. As for us who were before <HI>Burick,</HI> we pre∣par'd
<PB N="42" REF="23"/>our selves to attaque it so vigorously, as not be behind-hand with the other Ar∣mies. We made Faggots, and in the After∣noon carryed them almost as far as the Pal∣lisado's, not without the loss of some Troopers and their Horses, as well there as in our Camp, which lay level with the Canon of the Town. In the Evening, that part of the Regiment of the Kings Guards which was in our Army, and the Regiments of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Artois,</HI> opened their Trenches. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> with 150 Dragoons which he commanded, was to at∣taque a Half-moon, and intending to make his way forwards, resolved himself to be at the head of them. A like number were drawn out of the Regiments of <HI>Castelneau</HI> and <HI>Tu∣renne,</HI> to do as much on the other side; which returning all safe, could not properly be said to have gone upon the Forlorn. But just as we were about to fall on, we heard a Trum∣pet from the Town, and assoon as we had an∣swered it an Officer came forth, &amp; after him a second, so that the Soldiers of the Guards, without staying for the issue of the design'd Conference, began to cry, That they might leave off working at their Trenches, seeing the Enemy yielded, and desired quar∣ter. But the last Officer seeming a little
<PB N="43" REF="23"/>more fierce and resolute then the other, because he had not a ready answer; we pre∣pared to fall on immediatly if they did not yield without delay; which the Enemy per∣ceiving, and having discover'd some Scaling-ladders just ready to be made use of, they open'd their Gates, and the Regiment of Guards enter'd the Town just about Mid∣night, and feasted themselves with the Pro∣visions which they found were bringing to the Soldiers that were upon Service in the Out-works. All the Garrison were made Prisoners at discretion.</P>
<P><HI>Burick</HI> is a reasonable great Town, situate upon the left Bank of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> within two Musquet-shot of the River, in a fine even fertile Soil. The space that is between it and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> is a great Marsh, and deli∣cate Fields and Meadows, which are nothing near so boggy and wet, as the most part of the rest of <HI>Holland, Zeland</HI> and <HI>Frizeland.</HI> It lies over-against <HI>Wezel</HI> on the other side of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which is a very fair great Town. <HI>Burick</HI> is none of the least Towns which the Dutch have in these parts; its Fortifications are good, and it hath good Bastions and Half∣moons, almost wholly of earth, but their Out∣works are too big. The C. <HI>de Chamilly</HI> speak∣ing of this Town, said, It might well have held out 3 Months: From whence 'tis plain,
<PB N="44" REF="24"/>that in the confidence of its strength the Hol∣landers had been negligent: and not having taken care to keep their Fortifications in good repair, we found them laboring day and night in making Gabions for the top of the Ramparts; but they were so suddenly and briskly set upon, that they could by no means perfect them. The same day we took two Barques upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and by that means we doubled the Guard we had plac'd in the middle of it. As soon as <HI>Burick</HI> was yielded, M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> receiv'd a Pacquet from the King, upon which he immediatly hastned to wait on His Majesty.</P>
<P>The fourth, nothing was done at the Kings Army, nor at Monsieur <HI>Turenne</HI>'s; but at the Princes they open'd Trenches before <HI>Wezel,</HI> which would not yield up to mercy. They were begun on the side of the Town that lies toward the River, and a Drain was made to empty the Ditch, which would have been done the night following, had not the Ene∣my at last, seeing his Highness resolv'd to set on then vigorously, sent the Keys of the Town, and yielded themselves up to mercy. At the same time we were inform'd, that the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> had taken <HI>Lokem.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth, the Kings Army was busied in making Faggots and Gabions for the attaqu∣ing of <HI>Rhineberg.</HI> His Majesty sent a Com∣mand
<PB N="45" REF="24"/>to M. <HI>de Ranes</HI> to meet him there with the Regiment Royal of Dragoons, which was then with him before <HI>Burick,</HI> which he did. M. the Prince at 6 in the Morning en∣tred <HI>Wezel,</HI> and visited the Officers and Sol∣diers of the Garrison, where he search'd for French-men, and finding 10 or 11, had them hang'd. The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> turn'd off toward <HI>Grol,</HI> and M. <HI>Turenne</HI>'s Army rested. M. <HI>Cajax</HI> was made Governor of <HI>Orsoy.</HI></P>
<P>The fixth in the Morning, 10000 Faggots more were ordered to be made, which the Dragoons perform'd, but the Garrison at <HI>Rhineberg</HI> finding themselves too weak to resist a Victorious Royal Army; and being likewise out of hope of receiving the Suc∣cors were promised them by the States, re∣solv'd to yield. The Officers of the Gar∣rison came, and laying themselves at his Feet, begg'd of him not to take ad∣vantage to their cost of the trick which the States had put upon them, in promising them 2000 Men more as a reinforcement, which they had not perform'd. His Majesty consi∣dering the falshood of the States Promises, even to their own Soldiers, was mov'd to compassionate their condition, and thereupon gave them leave to march out, Drums beat∣ing, Colours flying, with Match lighted, and Bullet in mouth; which they did, and march'd
<PB N="46" REF="25"/>toward <HI>Maestricht,</HI> the King having given them a Convoy, and Provision for four days. The Regiment of <HI>Guards</HI> entred the place about one of the Clock in the After∣noon.</P>
<P><HI>Rhineberg</HI> is a pretty large Town, be∣longing to the Archbishoprick of <HI>Colen,</HI> si∣tuate on the left side of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> in the midst of a very low Marshy Country, which contributes much to its strength. The States had taken it again and again from the Spaniards, they having wrongfully took it from the Elector of <HI>Colen,</HI> who ever since hath been demanding it of them, and making complaints upon that account in every Diet; till at length the Spaniard propos'd to give it him back, on condition he might keep a Garrison there: But this condition not plea∣sing the Elector, they at last promis'd, with∣out any reserve, to put it into his hands; but how instant soever the Elector was with them, he could never perswade them to be as good as their word: they had so many shifts, feig∣ned excuses, and pretences, that at last they proved the chief cause of the Electors de∣claring War against them. Whilst it was in their possession, they fortifyed it to their own minds; and being it was a Frontier Town, they had made it one of their strongest Holds. The Fortifications are very regular;
<PB N="47" REF="25"/>there are good Bastions and Half-moons, good Ramparts, and very broad Ditches: but their Out-works are to big, as in most of their Towns. All the Works are of Earth, which makes them the easier to be assaulted, though it better resist the Canon, which can only make a hole in them.</P>
<P>The same day some Foot were sent o∣ver the <HI>Rhine</HI> to plunder a certain Castle there, but the Prince had sent some others to the same purpose the day before; so that those who came last, did but lose their la∣bor. The Princes and Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI>'s Armies rested again, and the Count <HI>d'Estrade</HI> was made Governor of <HI>Wezel.</HI></P>
<P>The seventh, Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> left the King, and so did M. <HI>de Ranes,</HI> and the Regiment Royal of Dragoons. We went and joyn'd with the Army which was left before <HI>Burick,</HI> and having sent all our hea∣viest baggage to <HI>Rhineberg,</HI> where we left the new Companies of the Regiment of <HI>Turenne</HI> in garrison, we went and encamp'd at <HI>Worstemberg</HI> near <HI>Santein,</HI> in the Country of <HI>Cleve,</HI> which belongs to the Duke of <HI>Brandenbourg.</HI> M. the Prince left <HI>Wezel,</HI> and advanced likewise on his side. The King's Army stayed still at <HI>Rhineberg,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> with the <HI>Munster</HI> forces attaqued <HI>Grol.</HI></P>
<PB N="48" REF="26"/>
<P>The eighth, the King left <HI>Rhineberg,</HI> &amp; came to <HI>Burick,</HI> whether the Float was brought to waft over the Army to the other side of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> We left <HI>Worstemberg</HI> in the morn∣ing, passed by <HI>Zante</HI> or <HI>Santein,</HI> and went and besieg'd the Fort of <HI>Rees,</HI> which we present∣ly beset so closely, that the frighted Garri∣son durst not fire so much as one gun. But the Town which lyes on the other bank of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> was not so civil, for their Canon did much harm to our Dragoons, especially those, who being come close up, lay open to them. There were many of them lost, and more of their horses. But notwithstanding the Capitulation went on at the Fort, which was but ill man'd, and because the Gover∣nor stood upon terms, and would not deli∣ver the place before he had seen and felt our Canon, M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> commanded the Foot to advance and begin the Assault, which they did without any resistance from the Enemy (who had retired into a Redout which was very strong.) Wherefore he caus'd a bridge of hurdles to be made, by which he pass'd over and enter'd the place himself, and commanded the Governor and his Gar∣rison to be beset, who at last yeilded. After∣wards we turn'd the Canon of this Fort up∣on the Town, and much shot past on both sides. Many of the Enemies Guns were dis∣mounted,
<PB N="49" REF="26"/>and the whole Town so tired out that the next day they were forc'd to carry the Keys of their Gates to M. the Prince, who came up as we did, and made a shew as if he would also have attaqued it, though his design was to go streight on to∣wards a party of the Enemies which kept the Passage of the Isle of <HI>Beter</HI> and of the <HI>Yssel,</HI> that the King might go and besiege that Town and <HI>Emerick.</HI> As soon as the Fort had yeilded, Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> left there a part of his Horse, all his foot, the Artillery and Baggage; and upon no tice that 4000 of the Enemies Horse had pass'd the <HI>Wahal,</HI> with a design, as 'twas thought, to set upon us, we went to meet them. To that purpose we went and pass'd the River near <HI>Calcar,</HI> a little Town (in the Country of <HI>Cleve</HI>) defended by a Citadel, whose fortifications are all of earth without any other facing. We were saluted in our passage by at least 100 great Guns, and thence pass'd to <HI>Cleves,</HI> where our Army was victualled <HI>gratis.</HI> It is the capital City of the whole Province, but is a place of no defence. Afterwards we encamped a quarter of an hours riding from that City, by a park, which belongs to a House of pleasure of the Duke of <HI>Brandebourg.</HI></P>
<P>The ninth was wholly spent in passing the
<PB N="50" REF="27"/>Kings Army from the left to the right side of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The town of <HI>Rees</HI> quite spent and wearied out by our Canon from the Fort, brought in her Keys, and yeilded as the rest had done.</P>
<P><HI>Rees</HI> is a fair great Town situate on the right side of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> 3 leagues below <HI>Bu∣rick</HI> and <HI>Wezel,</HI> and 2 leagues above <HI>Emerick.</HI> It is strengthned by a good Fort of its own name, separated from it only by the <HI>Rhine,</HI> whose waters on the right side wash the walls of the Town, and on the left those of the Fort. This Town is very great, her for∣tifications very compleat and good. It hath good Bastions, Horn-works, Half-Moons well strengthn'd with good Pallissados, large ditches, and covered ways, all very regular. In fine, when M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> enter'd the Fort, he told them that were near him, that their friends that knew <HI>Reés,</HI> and heard they laid Siege to it, would certainly be very much concern'd for them: and thereupon having sent for the sieur <HI>Paul,</HI> a Flemming Engineer, to ask his opinion of it, he answered him, that if any body would have an excellent Model of a regular Fortification, they need not seek it any where else, but might take it from <HI>Rees</HI> and its Fort; which is a Pen∣tagone, whose outworks were a little out of repair, but within there was a Redout
<PB N="51" REF="27"/>which they call the Castle, which is very well and in good case. It is separated from the Body of the Fort by a great flat broad ditch, which is deeper then it is broad, over which there is a little Draw-bridge, and a good Gate on the other side, and a high ram∣part well pallissado'd and Gabioon'd, which at each corner hath two little Horn-works, which flank upon the bridge and ditch.</P>
<P>At the same time M. the Prince advanced towards <HI>Emerick,</HI> which made no resistance, the Dutch having withdrawn their Garrison some days before.</P>
<P><HI>Emerick</HI> is a pleasant town, seated on the right side of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> a league above that place where the river divides, and makes the <HI>Rhine</HI> with its right branch, and the <HI>Wa∣hal</HI> with its left. Tis a reasonable good town, and its fortifications, that are all of earth, are well enough maintained. However the Dutch some few days before the Princes ar∣rival, withdrew themselves and quitted their Garrison; either because they thought it could not endure a Siege, or for some other reason, that I am ignorant of, &amp; cannot imagine what it should be; for since that time we have taken several Towns not so strong as that, where∣in they had made very good Garrisons.</P>
<P>That morning M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> with some Officers, and a small Guard, went to take a
<PB N="52" REF="28"/>view of <HI>Skinksconce,</HI> and came so near as to be within hearing of the Garrison: from whom we received about 40 musket, and several Canon shot, but they did no execution. Thereupon, having learned the retreat of the enemy, we returned back, and joyned with the rest of the Army, near the Fort of <HI>Reés,</HI> in the mid way between <HI>Calcar,</HI> and another place called <HI>Hompel.</HI></P>
<P>The same day M. the Prince advanced above <HI>Skinksconce,</HI> the <HI>Rhine</HI> lying between him and it, and discovered the enemy on the other side, guarding that passage.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Dragoons of the <HI>Colonel</HI> Regiment were commanded to at∣taque <HI>Demecum;</HI> but that place held out so little a while, that they had time enough to come back, and share the Glory of that pas∣sage, that was made two days after.</P>
<P>The 10 his Majesty came to <HI>Reés,</HI> we stayed with M. <HI>de Turenne</HI>'s Army, where we received the news of the taking of <HI>Grol</HI> by the Bishop of Munsters Forces. That Town, if not the strongest and most conside∣rable that the Hollanders were masters of, was yet of great consequence to them, as lying on the Frontiers of Germany, and being excellently well seated; on which ac∣count twas fortified by <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth. It hath five Bastions, fair and good Ram∣parts,
<PB N="53" REF="28"/>besides a great ditch, that cannot easily be emtied, by reason of the river <HI>Sling,</HI> that discharges it self into it.</P>
<P>The 11 his Majesty being advised that M. the Prince intended to swim the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and endeavour to force the enemy from the other side, though they appear'd to be considera∣bly strong, resolved to be present in person at that Enterprise, which never had any equal, nor attended with like success, and, as it were, divest himself for some time of his Title and Dignity, to share with his Soldiers, under the quality of a Feild-Marshal or private person, the honour of a day, that was almost to decide the fortune of all Holland.</P>
<P>To this intent he left his Army in their Quarters; and having taken with him his house Guard, and 2000 loose horse, he incam∣ped on the side of the River, on the right hand of <HI>Tolhuys,</HI> a small Fort about a league below <HI>Skinksconce</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Betaw.</HI> The enemy, that lay intrench'd on the other side, in number about three or four thousand, gave fire, and skirmished all that day. We on our side caused some Foot to advance, whilst we raised a battery of five peices of Canon. In the mean time the Army of M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> approached to pass over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> over against <HI>Reés,</HI> on a float of wood:
<PB N="54" REF="29"/>who after he had convayed over his Majesty, with his Army and the baggage to <HI>Wezel,</HI> came down to do the like with his own Army: but the water being low, and no great wind stirring, they encamped at <HI>Nerdmorm∣ter,</HI> and began not to pass till the evening: and so the foot continued to pass all night, and afterwards the horse.</P>
<P>The 12 in the morning, his Majesty hav∣ing expressed he should be glad to have the passage of <HI>Tolbuys</HI> sounded, to try if it were not too deep before they ventured on it, M. the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> went immediately, and sounded it himself. Thereupon command was given to horse; and his Majesty, vext to see the enemy pretend a desire to engage, and not being able to endure those out∣ward signs, that were so contrary to their inclinations, without staying to draw up, and not considering whether his Guards, <HI>Gendarmes,</HI> and light horse were present or no, who were to make the first onset, having found the <HI>Cuirassiers</HI> near at hand, he commanded them to fling them∣selves into the water and cross the river; which they did so briskly, that the poor M. the Marquis <HI>de la Salle,</HI> whom they hap∣pened to meet in their way, received from them five or six dangerous wounds, as if he had been a Hollander (for indeed they
<PB N="55" REF="29"/>took him for one) though he was clothed after the French mode, and had a white scarf on. Monsieur the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> was at the head of them, and did all that a good Captain and a brave Soldier could have done on the like occasion. The Forces of his Ma∣jesties house were commanded to pass next, and to swim the river; which they imme∣diately did with so much courage and reso∣lution, as struck a terrour into the Enemy. They were followed by a great number of Volunteers; and immediately our Canon began to play, as also did that of the Ene∣my. In the mean time General <HI>Wurts,</HI> Com∣mander of the Troops that guarded the pas∣sage, being a stout and well experienced Captain, marched at the head of the first squadron, and caused them to advance into the water up to their Horses bellies, having given order to all the rest to follow him in∣to the river, some on the right, and some on the left hand. The first squadron advanced with resolution, and made a brisk discharge, at which M. the Count <HI>de Nogent,</HI> Feild-Marshal to that Army, a person of a brave and daring spirit, received a wound in his head, which made him sink into the water, where he was unfortunatly drown'd. But the following squadrons that had orders to enter the river, not daring to run that hazard, stayed
<PB N="56" REF="30"/>in the rear of the former, and by that means gave liberty to our men to pass, both on the right and the left wing, and at the same time to come upon them on the flank. In the mean time the Dragoons, being impa∣tient also to cross the river, though having had no order they did not dare to do it, ad∣vanced part of them into the water, that they might skirmish more commodiously, and never ceased giving fire. At length the Dutch took the rout, and the Commander himself, that had enter'd so briskly into the water, was forced to consult his own safety by flight. For having comforted his men, and told them that no Nation but ours, was ca∣pable of such bold enterprises, and that no∣thing would be able to resist us, trusted his life and his honour to his Horses feet, and at length made his escape, after he had fled a league or two, and suffered a continual loss of his men in the pursuit. During this time, the Generals and Monsieur the Prince him∣self having past the river, the Enemies Foot, that could not take the same course that the Horse had done, and had nothing to hope for but death or mercy, began to mollify, and M. <HI>de Longueville</HI> with the Duke and other Volunteers were coming up to them. But M. the Prince observing the Enemy to yeild, and fearing the youthfull
<PB N="57" REF="30"/>heat of the young Gentlemen would pro∣duce some bad effect, run up, crying they would cause his son to be killed: and having made all possible hast, he came up to the trenches as soon as the rest, and cryed out to the Enemy they were all Rogues, and if they shot once more, he would have them all hanged. His threats made them all lay down their arms, and cry out in their own Language <HI>Kartyr, Kartyr.</HI> But the misfor∣tune was, that M. <HI>de Longueville,</HI> not taking notice of what had past, and desiring to free that Post, found a passage too soon; and falling upon the first Officer that he met, kill'd him on the place: and upon the con∣fused noise he heard of <HI>Kartyr,</HI> which the Enemy demanded, he gave a sign with his hand, and cryed, <HI>no Quarter,</HI> being imme∣diatly followed by all his men that were then present. Thereupon the Enemy, despairing of their lives, betook themselves again to their arms, and gave one shot more, which proved a very fortunate one to them: for at it the <HI>sieur de Longueville,</HI> M. <HI>de Guitry,</HI> Grand Master of the Kings Wardrobe, M. <HI>d'Aubusson,</HI> the Marquis <HI>de Tasse,</HI> nephew to Monsieur the Marshal <HI>de la Force,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Theobon</HI> were killed upon the place. Several others also were wounded, amongst which were M. the Duke <HI>de Coistin,</HI> and M.
<PB N="58" REF="31"/><HI>de Vivonne,</HI> M. the Prince <HI>de Marsillac,</HI> M. the Count <HI>de Saulx,</HI> the last in the face and the arm, after he had been ingaged in the general and a single Combat: For having gone too far in the pursuit of the Enemy, he found himself alone with one of their Officers, who put himself upon his guard, and wounded the Count in his face. M. <HI>de Brouilly</HI> dyed in a short time of his wounds, M. <HI>de Termes</HI> was also wounded, and M. the Count <HI>de Revel</HI> received a wound on his arm, and another of a musket shot in his thigh. M. <HI>de Beringhen</HI> was shot through the breast. The other persons of note that were wound∣ed, were the Marquis <HI>de Beauveau, de Mont-revert, de Beaumont, de S. Arnoul,</HI> and which was worst of all, Monsieur the Prince had his left arm broke at the wrist; which accident did much retard and lessen his Majesties Conquests: for his name alone made the Enemy tremble, and they began not to make resistance, till they had learnt the news of his mishap: considering too that from that time Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> was obliged to command in his place, and to join the Troops of his own Army with those of the King: so that of three Armies there remained now but two. The enemies also on their side lost in this rencounter three or four hundred men, that were killed upon
<PB N="59" REF="31"/>the place, besides a great num<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that were taken prisoners.

<P>The thirteenth, the Bridge of Boats, that had been making the day before, was fi∣nished; and the Army of M. the Prince be∣gan at break of day to march over with M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who from that time com∣manded alwaies in the place of his Highness. When they were all over they pillaged <HI>Tol∣huys,</HI> a plain Castle with one great Tower, guarded only by a ditch and a wall: but being seated within a musket shot of the river, near the passage, a hundred looss horse, that had been drawn out of the Fort of <HI>Schain</HI> to secure that Castle, had time enough to give two volleys of musket shot, and dis∣charge twice or thrice a peice of Canon that carried eighteen pound bullet charged with cartridges, before we could get over and come up to them: and afterwards they had the conveniency to retire before our coming, because M. the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who was the first that passed, had busied himself in
<PB N="60" REF="32"/>pursuit of the horse, and M. the Prince of the foot, as was said before. We found in this Castle store of fair and good Moveables, some persons also, that had retired thither in hope that we would not have attacqued Holland, about this Isle, but have passed directly on to <HI>Yssel,</HI> where the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Count <HI>Maurice</HI> were both with their Armies.</P>
<P>After the pillage of this Castle, Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> marched on close after the Ene∣my, a party of which he overtook, and found breaking a bridge, upon the Channel that runs from <HI>Arnhem</HI> to <HI>Nimegen,</HI> over which we must necessarily pass.</P>
<P>These men, though but a small party, had a mind to finish their enterprise, perhaps because they thought they might be second∣ed with the rest of the Army, that was not gone far; but having skirmish'd a little with the Vanguard, the Dragoons lighting of their horses, set upon them so vigourously, that they gave them the rout, and forced them into <HI>Arnhem.</HI> And finding themselves well enough at the end of a bridge that lyes over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and reaches from this Town to the Isle of <HI>Betau,</HI> they lodged there, maugre the Canon and musket shot of the Enemy, that fortunately killed more horses then men.</P>
<PB N="61" REF="32"/>
<P>His Majesty having call'd a Council be∣fore the departure of M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> as soon as it was ended began to march towards <HI>Emerick,</HI> to joyn with his Army, which all this time lay in their Quarters at <HI>Reés.</HI> The Army also, that had been commanded by M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> came thither likewise, and made up one body with that of the King. The Troops that had followed his Majesties two days before, and those of his own <HI>House</HI> did the like.</P>
<P>M. the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> natural Son to the King of England, arrived the same day at the Camp at <HI>Emerick,</HI> with 7000 foot, that were all brisk and active men. Mon∣sieur the Cardinal <HI>de Bouillon</HI> that day consecrated anew the great Church of <HI>Reés.</HI></P>
<P>The 14<SUP>th</SUP> his Majesty rested with his whole Army, at the Camp of <HI>Emerick.</HI> After dinner he visited M. the Prince (who the day be∣fore had caused himself with the rest that were wounded, to be removed into this Town) and at his return took a view of the Duke of <HI>Monmouths</HI> Forces. Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> seeing his affaires so well advanced before <HI>Arnhem,</HI> resolved to lay siege to it, and thereupon having taken a view of it, and taken up his Quarters, he sammoned the Town.</P>
<P>In the mean while, that no time might
<PB N="62" REF="33"/>be lost, M. the Count <HI>du Plessis</HI> employed some men about repairing the boats that the Enemies had began to break, as being neces∣sary for our passage; but in that action he was killed with a Canon shot to the great regret of the whole Army. The Dragoons, which were much incommoded by a guard of the Enemy placed in a redoubt on the other side of the river, were resolved to ven∣ture the passage, which, after orders were given, they performed with so much resolu∣tion and success, as struck a terrour into the Town; whereupon the Burghers began to mutiny, and at length forced the Garrison to leave of firing.</P>
<P>The Fame of General <HI>Wurts</HI> defeat, and of our entrance into <HI>Betaw,</HI> was not long a spreading, and the noise of it no sooner came to the ears of the Prince of Orange, who with his Army guarded the passage of <HI>Yssel,</HI> but the Enemy, being daunted with the news, thought of nothing but a retreat, which was done in so great hast, as terrified all the places through which they passed.</P>
<P>In the mean time M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> ordered 150 horse under the command of a Captain of the horse of <HI>Condé,</HI> to swim the river, and to fall on their rear Guard, that passed pretty near <HI>Arnham.</HI> The Enemy little expecting this attaque, as thinking themselves secured
<PB N="63" REF="33"/>by the River, were so surprised at this as∣sault, that the Guard of the Baggage aban∣doned it all to those few horse, who made themselves masters of it at their leasure, and returned loaded with so great a booty, that they had enriched themselves by it, though they had not joyned to it the two other of, which they had also the spoile, which amount∣ed to no less then fourty thousand Francks. The same day M. the Cardinal <HI>de Bouillon</HI> consecrated anew the great Church of <HI>E∣merick.</HI></P>
<P>The 15. The Kings Army rested, and His Majesty took a view of it after dinner.</P>
<P>Upon the Summons that M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> had given to <HI>Arnhem,</HI> the Citizens began to mutiny, and threatned the Garrison to cut all their Throats if they fired any more; whereupon they came and demanded Arti∣cles: but M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> sent them to the King, and immediatly marched away with the greatest part of his Army, to besiege <HI>Knotzembourg,</HI> otherwise called the Fort of <HI>Nimigen,</HI> because it is seated on the right side of the <HI>Wahal,</HI> directly opposite to that great Town, that lies on the left hand. He arrived thither time enough to open his Trenches that Evening, it being but three little Leagues from <HI>Arnhem.</HI> That Night we worked with so much success, as to lodge
<PB N="64" REF="34"/>our selves on their Counterscarpe, by which we became Masters of their covered way, but not without some difficulty, and the loss of several Men: for they defended them∣selves from the Fort very briskly, and gave continual fire from the Town; besides three Boats, each of them provided with 8, 10, or 12 pieces of Canon, came round, and fired at us with full Charges at about thirty paces distance. During all that Night, there was fired so great a number of Canon-shot, that those that heard it from <HI>Emerick,</HI> where His Majesties Army lay, could not imagine where so continual a noise should be made: but from another place where the noise could not plainly be heard, one would have thought they had been Musket-shot, and on∣ly an engagement of some Foot.</P>
<P>The 16. His Majesty early in the Morning parted with all His Army from <HI>Emerick,</HI> and encamped at <HI>Latem</HI> upon the River <HI>Yssell,</HI> or rather the Channel of <HI>Drusus.</HI> A branch of this River that runs from <HI>Arnhem</HI> to <HI>Do∣esburg,</HI> is a Channel that communicates be∣tween the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Yssel,</HI> which was made by <HI>Drusus</HI> in the time of the Romans, whence 'tis called the Channel of <HI>Drusus,</HI> or the <HI>Drusian</HI> Ditch. In the mean time we advanced to <HI>Zevenaer,</HI> a small Town, that hath no other Fortification but its Ramparts,
<PB N="65" REF="34"/>so that we made our selves Masters of it without any great difficulty. Presently af∣ter that, M. the Count <HI>de l' Orge,</HI> and M. the Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> had command to pass the <HI>Yssel;</HI> the one with 4000 Horse, and the o∣ther with the <HI>Regiment Royal</HI> of Dragoons, to take the places that lie before <HI>Doesburg,</HI> which immediatly they did. But the De∣puties of <HI>Arnhem</HI> having came to the King, and brought the Keys of their Town with∣out Conditions, His Majesty in the After∣noon gave order to the M. <HI>de Ranes</HI> to go with his Dragoons to take possession of the Town. M. the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> went thither also; and the Inhabitants had granted them a freedom of their Religion, with all their Priviledges, but the Garrison were made Prisoners of War, and disarmed, to the number of 3000 Foot and 200 Horse, which were very sufficient to have defended the place. The Dragoons were hardly ma∣sters of the Gates, when 200 Bores that came to the Garrison with Provision, desired entrance; whom we suffered to come in, and afterwards made Prisoners with the rest.</P>
<P><HI>Arnhem</HI> is a great Town, seated on the right side of that Branch of the <HI>Rhine</HI> which keeps its name, and washes the Walls of the Town. Its situation is partly high, partly
<PB N="66" REF="35"/>low, being commanded on that side that looks towards the <HI>Velue</HI> by a Hill, which to repair the Injury it doth it, sends down a torrent of Water, that defends it on the other side by a great flat bottomed Ditch, all lined with Free-stone, which is the fairest and largest that one shall any where see, and which doth almost surround the Town, except on that side where the <HI>Rhine</HI> washes the Walls, and doth sufficient∣ly defend it. For the rest, the Hollanders have taken care enough, and bin very dili∣gent in fortifying it; and I may very well affirm, They have not very many Fortifica∣tions so good as these. They are all lined with Brick, which is not ordinary in their other Towns. The Ramparts also are very fair and large. To conclude, all things are very good, and it might be very well look'd upon as one of their best Towns.</P>
<P>At nine in the Evening, M. the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> brought thither the Regiment of <HI>Na∣var,</HI> and the Dragoons came back and en∣camped on the side of the <HI>Yssel.</HI> In the mean time M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> continued to storm the Fort of <HI>Nimigen,</HI> which defended it self al∣most all day with equal force: but having fired also on the Boats, they were run a ground so well, that the Enemy fearing least in the night we should make our descent in∣to
<PB N="67" REF="35"/>the Ditch, and so enter the Town, they rendred themselves up, after having killed 1000 or 1200 Men, of which the Sieur <HI>de la Plastriere,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the Re∣giment <HI>Lyonnois,</HI> and the Sieur <HI>Alsan</HI> the son, Lieutenant of the <HI>Colonel</HI> of <HI>Champagne,</HI> were the principal. M. <HI>Magalotty</HI> Camp-Marshal, lost a Finger of one Hand, and was hurt in the other.</P>
<P>The 17. in the Morning, the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> repass'd the <HI>Yssel</HI> with his Dragoons, upon a Bridge of Boats which he made over it, and went and joyn'd with the Kings Ar∣my, which by reason of a great maras was forced to turn back by the way of <HI>Zovenaer;</HI> and then passing by <HI>Dutecum</HI> went and be∣sieg'd <HI>Doesburg.</HI> M. the Prince removed to <HI>Arnhem,</HI> that he might not be far from the King. M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who came himself to acquaint the King with the taking of <HI>Knotzembourg,</HI> return'd immediatly, and caus'd us to march towards <HI>Skenkssconce,</HI> which since our passage over the River had been block'd up. The Marquis of <HI>Sauvebeuf,</HI> who, as has been said, was hurt before <HI>Mae∣stricht</HI> the 24. of <HI>May,</HI> and there taken Pri∣soner, came back to the Camp cured of his Wounds, and without having paid any ran∣som, by the means of the generous C. <HI>Rhin∣grave,</HI> who, together with the Spaniards in the
<PB N="68" REF="36"/>Garrison (whose Commanders had taken his part) had a contest with the States and Dutch party upon that account; for though the Dutch were willing enough to release him, yet they were very eager for to have him pay his ransom first: But at last, after a great dispute on both sides, the Spa∣niards threatned to forsake the Town if they would not agree; which made the States consent to give him his liberty freely, toge∣ther with a Pass to return to the Army.</P>
<P>The 18. The King summon'd <HI>Doesburg,</HI> but the Governor refusing to hearken to the Trumpeter, or receive the Letter he brought, His Najesty ordered preparations to be made to attaque it. Faggots and Gabions were commanded to be provided, which was done with all diligence. The Count <HI>de Lorge</HI> who lay on the other side of the River with 4000 Horse, advanced toward the Town, to hinder any Succors from being put into it that way. M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> caused Trench∣es to be open'd against <HI>Skenksconce,</HI> in which was a Garrison of 1900 Men. The same day, about four of the clock, M. <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> Captain of a Company of the Life Guards, and Lieutenant General in this Campagne, who had receiv'd Orders to be ready to march with 4000 Horse, set for∣ward only with 1800, because at so short
<PB N="69" REF="36"/>warning the Victuallers had not had time to bake Bread enough for so great a number. M. <HI>de Genlis</HI> was given him for his Camp-Marshal. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> set forward likewise with the Regiment Royal of Dra∣goons. We swam our Horses over the <HI>Yssel,</HI> and march'd on all the rest of that day, and the night following, without drawing bit.</P>
<P>The 19. was spent in preparations for o∣pening of Trenches before <HI>Doesburg,</HI> in making Faggots, Gabions and Bridges for communication. M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> on his side so vigorously assaulted <HI>Skenksconce,</HI> that the Garrison beginning to be disheartned, and dispairing of any succor, were thinking up∣on capitulating; which M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> su∣specting, sent the <HI>Colonel</HI> Regiment of Dra∣goons to attaque the Fort of S. <HI>Andrew,</HI> which made no long resistance, though there were in it 200 Men; and it be, I think, the best Fortress the Enemy hath. It lieth in the narrowest place of the Isle of <HI>Bommel,</HI> compast with five good Bastions, and water'd almost quite round by the River <HI>Wahal,</HI> so that it is impossible to drain its Ditches, and almost so, to make any Bridge over them without the consent of the Besieged. M. <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> with whom as I said we swam the <HI>Yssel,</HI> and march'd all night, continued still his march all this day, so that we were al∣most
<PB N="70" REF="37"/>23 hours continually on Horse-back without drawing Bit.</P>
<P>At two of the clock in the Afternoon, as we came out of a very fine Village, which we found deserted, our Van-guard discover∣ed a Body of Foot; which assoon as we went about to pursue, sav'd themselves in the neighboring Woods, which made us think they were only some Peasants, or some that had been laid in Ambush by Count <HI>Mau∣rice,</HI> whose Army we were in pursuit of. At last we came to <HI>Amerfort,</HI> with design to attaque and take it by assault; but the In∣habitants, who had ever since the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> his flight, kept some at the top of a Steeple to give them notice of our coming (that they might not fall into the Trap we had laid for them) and being advertized of our coming, came out before us, and obtain'd the free use of their Religion and preserva∣tion of their Rights and Priviledges, open'd their Gates to the Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> who entred the Town with the Regiment Royal of Dragoons which he had brought with him, and staid there until the 27 of the same Month. The Sieur <HI>de Mazelles,</HI> a Captain of Horse, having at the same time been drawn out (with his Company, which con∣sisted of 50 <HI>Maistres,</HI> and the Sieur <HI>de Bon∣neval</HI> Captain of Dragoons, with 100 <HI>Mai∣stres</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="37"/>of the same Body) to go forward and get intelligence of the Enemy, march'd all night toward <HI>Naerden,</HI> a little, but very strong Town, which hath six Bastions, and lies just upon the Frontier of the Province of Holland, 3 little Leagues from <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> in which was a Garrison of 200 Men, as well Horse as Foot. At his arrival, he made all the noise he could with Drums &amp; Trum∣pets, beating and sounding divers Marches, and afterwards summon'd the Town; which being terrified and surprized, the Burgo∣masters of it came out to Treat, which they spun out so long, that the Garrison had time to make their escape: And when they were all gone, they open'd their Gates and admit∣ed him. As soon as he was in the Town, he made enquiry to know if there was no Sol∣diers in the place, and was told there was not; but considering that place to be of too much importance to be left without a Gar∣rison by the Hollander, he caus'd one of the Burgomasters to be apprehended, and told him, They should all lose their Heads, for not discovering to the King truly whether there were any Soldiers in the Town. These threats made them confess, That truly there had been some there, but as soon as they heard the noise of the French Troops, they had fled towards <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> whereupon
<PB N="72" REF="38"/>he immediatly caus'd the Gates to be open'd, and went out in pursuit of them; and at the same time order'd his Lieutenant, with some Horse, to follow the Enemies Horse, who were not yet out of sight; and were some a Horse-back, and others on Foot, their Horses being laden with their Baggage. The Lieutenant pursued them to the Gates of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> got the greatest part of their Baggage, and in his way homewards sum∣mon'd <HI>Muyden,</HI> which not finding in case to make any resistance, he entered, and was master of it for 2 hours: but at last finding himself to weak to keep that place, he re∣turned to fetch more Men; but in the mean time things put on another face. At the same time the Sieur <HI>de Mazelles</HI> on his side, had pursued the Foot, which took the way of the Fields and enclosures, and passing over 3 Bridges, still broke them as soon as they were got over, so that he was forced to his Horses strength to follow them. But the third time as he swam, his Horse was mired, so that taking only his Pistols, he left him there and follow▪d on, only accompanied with about 20 more of his Company, who making up to them upon the very mouths of their Muskets, at last took almost all the Soldiers, and two of their Captains Prison∣ers.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="38"/>
<P>This day the Inhabitants and Burgoma∣sters of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> and the Towns depending on it, being frighted by the suddain Con∣quests and Enterprizes which His Majesty so fortunatly and vigorously prosecuted, after 3 or 4 days consultation sent a Trumpeter to ask for a Pass, for them to come and bring the King the Keys of their Town and its dependents, viz. <HI>Amersfort,</HI> (which we had unknown to them already taken) <HI>Ew∣ick, Rhenen</HI> and <HI>Montfort.</HI> The same day we were inform'd, that the States-General had left the <HI>Hague</HI> in a fright, and retired to <HI>Am∣sterdam</HI> with all their Writings and Riches; how they arrived there the seventeenth, and assembled themselves to consult on Saturday the eighteenth, being very much frighted and full of consternation. That they mi∣strusted the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> who had so soon taken flight, and retired with his Army to the Country about <HI>Leiden.</HI> We heard likewise of the pittiful condition to which Count <HI>Maurice</HI> and his Army were reduc'd, (who some days before had fled beyond <HI>Ʋ∣trecht,</HI> they having refus'd to admit him) and that he was now marching for <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> whether he had been sent for: That some of his Companies had not above five or six Men left, the rest having forsook him and fled to divers parts: That when they
<PB N="74" REF="39"/>were near <HI>Amersfort,</HI> a Bore having in sport told them, he had seen a great party of French thereabouts, immediately upon hearing of it, they took their heels and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed above 2 leagues, without stopping. The D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> came now, and laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e to <HI>Deventer.</HI></P>
<P>The 20 the Kings Army open'd their Trenches before <HI>Doesburg:</HI> they wrought hard all night pretty freely and undisturb'd∣ly, under the command of the Duke of <HI>Roannez,</HI> at the head of four Batalions of the French Guards, defended by Monsieur <HI>de Rommecourt,</HI> who commanded the horse Guards; for the Enemy fired but very spa∣ringly. Monsieur <HI>de Rochefort</HI> left <HI>Amersfort</HI> in the morning, and with a party of horse march'd towards <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> and by the way heard that <HI>Naerden</HI> was taken, and that the Count <HI>Maurice</HI> was not far from it. M. <HI>de Rancs</HI> came back to <HI>Amersfort,</HI> and took with him 150 horse, 50 of which were Dragoons, and we march'd all night that way. In the mean time the Marquis <HI>de la Trousse,</HI> who had been out by the King with 3 Squadrons to march towards <HI>Zutphen,</HI> frighted them of that place not a little, so that the Burgomasters considering that the longer they held out, the worse conditions they should have, and that on the other side
<PB N="75" REF="39"/>they could hope for no succours, sent to let him know that they desir'd they might send Deputies to the King to Capitulate for them, and that their Governour would not be against it: the Marquis <HI>de la Trousse</HI> pre∣sently inform'd his Majesty of what had pass'd, whereupon <HI>Monsieur</HI> prepar'd to march thither, and in the mean time the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> sent some Dragoons to the Castle of <HI>Em,</HI> who possest themselves of it. This <HI>Castle</HI> takes its name from the little river <HI>Em,</HI> which runs from <HI>Amersfort,</HI> and discharges it self into the <HI>Zuiderzée,</HI> after it hath run by this Castle which lyes near the mouth of it.</P>
<P>The 21 the Garrison of <HI>Doesburg,</HI> which the night before were as quiet as if they had been a sleep, began to bestir them∣selves in the morning, and at break of day began to fire very furiously: but this hinder'd us not from going on in our work happily enough, and with little loss, so that the Bat∣teries were made fit to play.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur</HI> being come to <HI>Zutphen,</HI> sum∣mon'd it, but they absolutely refus'd to yeild it up, which so much the more incensed his Royal Highness, because the day before they had sent to propose the yeilding it.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Ranes</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Naerden</HI> about 2 of the clock in the morning, he rein∣forc'd
<PB N="76" REF="40"/>the Garrison with 50 Dragoons, be∣sides those 100 which were there already, with the Company of the <HI>Sieur de Marelles,</HI> upon notice that Count <HI>Maurice</HI> was there∣about with his Troops, and that he had put 2000 men into <HI>Muyden</HI> (which he had that day done so suddenly, that the Lieutenant, who had been master of it 2 houres, and went to fetch more men to put into it, when he came back, found the Enemy possest of it) and had now retrench'd himself on the other side of the stream of <HI>Wesep.</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> at last made himself Master of <HI>Skenksconce,</HI> and then turn'd his Arms to∣wards <HI>Nimegen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Skenksconce</HI> is a little hole (as I may say) so famous that it were unnecessary to say any thing of it, but it is also of more than ordinary concern to the Possessours, because of its situation, which is just on the point of the Island <HI>Betaw,</HI> just where the <HI>Rhine</HI> divides it self into two great arms, whereof one retains its own name and runs towards <HI>Arnhem,</HI> and the other takes the name of <HI>Wahal,</HI> and leads to <HI>Nimegen.</HI> No Vessel can go up or down either River without their leave, who are Masters of this Fort; so that it is the Key which ei∣ther opens or shuts up all communication between <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> This makes
<PB N="77" REF="40"/>it of very great importance; for no Mer∣chandize as Rhenish Wine, Timber, and chiefly Firr-trees, which continually come down that way from <HI>Switzerland, Suaveland,</HI> and other places of <HI>Germany,</HI> and bring a great income both to those who send for them thence, and also to those who sell them again at second hand to other Nations, who come thither to buy them; so that the trade both of these Commodities, and a hundred more, cannot go on without the leave of this Fort. And as its situation is most ad∣vantagious, so is its strength proportion∣able, for on 2 sides Nature hath so strength∣en'd it with the defence of this great River, that it is not to be set upon that way, and on the other, which is that that faces the Isle, Art hath fortified it with a great ditch full of water, good Bastions and half Moons, and a strong Rampart, which make it in a manner impregnable. The In∣habitants of the Country round about, who can still remember former Wars, do assure us it was always thought impregnable, and in History we never find it ever was taken above twice, the first time in the year 1636, when a certain Captain of a Garrison in <HI>Guelderland</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> call'd <HI>Enhoolt,</HI> being very much incens'd against the Hollanders, for putting divers of his
<PB N="78" REF="41"/>friends and kindred to death, took it by surprize, so that this can hardly be called a taking of it: the second time was after a Siege which will be remembred many ages to come, since it lasted 8 months, and con∣sum'd so many men before it, that in many places it is yet known by the name of the French burying place, for they had then taken part with the Dutch, and did with their blood purchase there both Glory and Vi∣ctory. It is likewise reported that when it was taken, there were left in it but 12 men, who did even then maintain the place.</P>
<P><HI>Deventer,</HI> at last being tired out by the Bishop of <HI>Munsters Granados,</HI> yeilded, and it's Garrison march'd out with their arms towards <HI>Nimegen,</HI> with a Convoy, but so weak a one, that when they came near <HI>Zut∣phen,</HI> the Hollanders in spight of the Convoy, cast themselves into it, and this recruit it was which made the Governour change his mind, and deny to yeild up the Town to Monsieur, as he himself had propos'd the day before.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> having visited <HI>Naerden,</HI> and left good directions for the preservation of that Place, departed thence about 6 of the clock for <HI>Amersfort,</HI> and left the Burgomasters of <HI>Muyden</HI> not a little confounded for having profer'd the Keys
<PB N="79" REF="41"/>of that Town, when it was no more in their power to let him into it, and even them selves were shut out of it. The same day Deputies from the States left <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to come and find the King at <HI>Doesburg,</HI> whose Garrison attempted to make a sally, but without any success, for they were presently repulsed.</P>
<P>The 22 the <HI>Sieur Martinet</HI> Camp-Master to the Kings Regiment, appointed Governor of <HI>Emerick,</HI> and Camp-Marshal in this Cam∣pagne, imagining that some persons did dayly watch him out of a suspition, that he had not so much courage as he pretended to, did all that day and night run himself upon all dangers, and so fortunately, that with∣out receiving any wound, he advanc'd with his party much further among the Enemies Posts then could be expected; so that by ill fortune the Count of <HI>Soissons,</HI> who com∣manded the Isle of <HI>Yssel,</HI> and was order'd to shoot cross way upon a Post of the Enemies, not being aware that the said <HI>Sieur Mar∣tinet</HI> had already gain'd it, plaid upon it, so that <HI>Martinet</HI> was kill'd by a Canon shot; the same ill fortune took away the <HI>Sieur Sourry</HI> a Switzer Captain, and the <HI>Sieur Cy∣ron,</HI> who was appointed Governour of <HI>S. Menehould.</HI> This gave occasion to some who delight in railery, to say, that <HI>Doesbourg,</HI> which
<PB N="80" REF="42"/>the Hollanders had taken such pains to for∣tifie, and had 4500 men in it (who yeilded themselves up to mercy) had cost the King but one Swallow, one Mouse, and one Worm, <HI>from the signification of the French names,</HI> for indeed the Place yeilded upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Doesburg</HI> is a Town which hath not been long famous, and indeed was at first very inconsiderable, but since the Hollanders have found the possession of the <HI>Yssel</HI> to be so ne∣cessary to the preservation of their Country, they thought fit to fortifie all the Places that lye upon that River, and chiefly this which is situate just where the Channel of <HI>Drusus</HI> mingles its waters with those of this river. So that at present it is in a very good con∣dition, having good Fortifications, which for the most part are coated on the outside. It is strengthned on one side by the River, and on the other by a great Marsh, which lies between it and <HI>Arnhem,</HI> which altogether hinder it from being any way accessible, but by one neck of Land.</P>
<P>This place yeilded notwithstanding this day upon the same terms as did the rest. Af∣terwards his Majesty sent <HI>Monsieur</HI> a recruit of 4000 foot and 1500 horse, because he had with him but 6000 foot and 200 horse be∣fore. His Majesty sent him likewise the parti∣culars of the Capitulation at <HI>Deesburg,</HI> where∣fore
<PB N="81" REF="42"/><HI>Monsieur</HI> caused <HI>Zutphen</HI> to be again summoned, and sent the Governour a sight of the Articles of the Capitulation at <HI>Does∣burg;</HI> but this taking no effect, his Royal Highness caus'd many faggots to be made, and in the evening had the Trenches open'd by the Regiments of <HI>Normandy, Turenne,</HI> and <HI>Orleans.</HI></P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> continued battering <HI>Nimegen</HI> from the Fort of <HI>Knotzembourg,</HI> without attaquing it on any other side; but sent and took in <HI>Worm.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sieurs de Rochefort</HI> and <HI>de Ranes</HI> went to <HI>Naerden,</HI> and drew near to <HI>Muyden,</HI> to take a view of the Enemy, who appear'd in great numbers upon a Bastion, but never offer'd to sally out. From thence they return∣ed to <HI>Amersfort,</HI> whither came also a party of Musqueteers and 1800 horse from the Kings Army. The body of Monsieur the Count <HI>de Nogent,</HI> who had been kill'd by a musket shot, as he swam the <HI>Rhine,</HI> was found about 3 leagues lower, and bu∣ried in the great Church at <HI>Zevenaer</HI> with all possible State.</P>
<P>News was brought to the King of <HI>De∣venter</HI>'s being taken by the Confederate Ar∣myes of <HI>Munster</HI> and <HI>Cologne,</HI> and that <HI>Swol, Campen, Elburg, Alderwick, Hasselt, Hat∣tem</HI> and <HI>Ommen</HI> had upon the single sum∣mons
<PB N="82" REF="43"/>of a Trumpet, drove out their Gar∣risons, and received those sent them by the Confederates.</P>
<P>The 23 Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> sent news to the King, of the taking of the Forts of S. <HI>Andrew</HI> and <HI>Worm's,</HI> which are the Keys to the Island of <HI>Bommelle.</HI> Before <HI>Zutphen</HI> the Canon was in a condition to play by break of day, and did the Enemy conside∣rable dammage. An hour before day, the besieg'd tried to give a false Alarm, but it succeeded not as they hop'd: for the Cheva∣lier <HI>de Lorraine,</HI> who had not stirred from that Trench, discovered their design, and kept the Soldiers in due order. At 2 in the morning Monsieur <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> who had return'd to <HI>Amersfort,</HI> left it again to go with all his horse, as well those who came the last night, as those which were in the Town before, and encamp'd at the Gates of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> between the Town and the Enemy. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> stayed at <HI>Amersford</HI> with his Royal Regiment of Dragoons, and in the evening caus'd all things necessary for an Assault to be carried upon the works, that they might be ready in case of need. About nine in the morning the same day, the <HI>Sieur Hotain,</HI> a Colonel of the <HI>Munster</HI> Troops, who then commanded a flying Party, came before the Town, and summon'd it, but un∣derstanding
<PB N="83" REF="43"/>it was already possest, he com∣manded his Army to make a halt, and gave order that 800 horse and 500 Dragoons, which he commanded, should refresh them∣selves. Afterwards he desir'd he might come in and salute the Governour; which he did, and breakfasted with him, he, and 3 or 4 more of his Company. He confirm'd the news of <HI>Deventer,</HI> and of the deaths of M. <HI>de Gerzey,</HI> and M. <HI>de Beaufort,</HI> Camp Master to a Regiment of horse, who in a sally which the Enemy made, beat them back into the Town, but having engag'd himself beyond possibility of retreating, receiv'd a great many wounds, of which he dyed on the place, as well as the <HI>sieur Mallet,</HI> a Captain of horse in the same Regiment, and the <HI>sieur Mauvoi∣siniere</HI> his Lieutenant. The same person af∣firm'd he had newly made himself Master of <HI>Elbairg</HI> and <HI>Harderwick,</HI> which are two little Towns above <HI>Campen,</HI> near <HI>Zuiderzee.</HI></P>
<P>After breakfast, as he took leave, he said he was going to raise contribution of all the places that depended upon those two Towns, and that he had taxed the Peasants at a <HI>Patagon</HI> (which is equal to a French Crown) for every Hearth, and then was re∣turning to <HI>Harderwick.</HI></P>
<P>A party of the <HI>Colonel</HI> Regiment of Dra∣goons being sent to <HI>Waningen,</HI> took it, and
<PB N="84" REF="44"/>stayed there some days, as well to refresh themselves, as to stay till there should come thither a body of foot.</P>
<P><HI>Waningen</HI> is a pretty Town about the big∣ness of <HI>Meaux</HI> in <HI>Brie,</HI> situated in an un∣even Country. On the upper side of it there lyes a heath of 4 or 5 leagues extent in the narrowest place, on the other side there are very good Pastures, intermingled with some Arable land, which is very fruitful. This town lying in the midst of many others, the States thought it unnecessary to fortifie, but left it in its ancient condition, so that it hath hardly any Fortification besides its rampart.</P>
<P>The same day a Swiss Drummer, who had been at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to carry news of some Prisoners to their Relations, and to desire them to send them money to pay their ran∣som, brought back word that he had been brought before Count <HI>Maurice,</HI> and mighti∣ly question'd by him: that his Army within their Retrenchments did not seem to contain above 4000 men, that they seem'd much dis∣may'd, and that all the fierceness which he strove to put on, could not hide his con∣cern when he heard in what condition the Kings Army was, and that the Count had taken order to let him see as little as might be of the disorder and slenderness of his Army. Let us therefore give them a little leasure to
<PB N="85" REF="44"/>take heart again if they can, and leaving a while the continuation of our <HI>Journal,</HI> let us rejoyce with the whole Kingdome of France, at our Great Monarchs fortunate Progress, and the Birth of a Prince, which GOD hath now sent Him.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNAL OF THE War with <HI>Holland.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE SECOND PART.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH Men naturally love change, and novelties carry still with them somewhat of delight, yet there are some things that immediatly disgust us, particularly those that are forc'd upon us. As God at our Creation made us free, so is there nothing more repugnant to our na∣tures, then to be forced or constrain'd to any thing, or deprived of that lov'd liberty, to which we were born. This it was which made the Philosophers say, that nothing w<SUP>ch</SUP> is violent or forced could be of long con∣tinuance, because such things directly op∣pose our nature, whose power cannot long be withstood, it being nothing but the Will of God impress'd upon his Creatures.
<PB N="88" REF="46"/>We ought not then to think it strange, that those who have from their youth been brought up under one kind of Government, should find a great deal of difficulty in wean∣ing themselves from that, and accustoming themselves to live under another, seeing it is natural to us so to do, and the very irrational Creatures do as much by instinct: as we see every day in Horses, who if they have been us'd to the Saddle cannot without much difficulty be brought to draw; and Dogs that have been us'd to hunt, will not without much trouble be brought to couch when their game is in view. It is a common saying that a Monkey will never leave his Apish tricks, and that a Fox will ever love Geese to his last: and so it is with Men, for those who have liv'd under a Monarchical State, are very hardly brought to be contented with Democracy, and all men think that kind of Government best, under which they them∣selves have been brought up. So that, though the French yoake be much less greivous to the Subject then that which the States have laid on the People of Holland (amongst whom the very Servants pay Taxes out of their wages) yet we had great reason to watch very carefully over those whom we had now lately conquer'd, upon the account of what we mention'd before, least Nature
<PB N="89" REF="46"/>should prevail in them, as it usually doth in other Creatures. But good Fortune, which hath always attended the French Arms, and that peculiar blessing which Heaven hath bestow'd on our King, of being equally both fear'd and belov'd where ever he goes, had taken care to make our suspicions groundless, by inspiring into the People of those Countreys as strong inclinations, and as much love towards his Majesty, as was to be found in the hearts of his most Loyal French Subjects; and we did very remark∣ably discover in many of them so greedy and earnest a desire of seeing us, that in many places they were even afraid, least we would not come and take their Towns; and I have been told they desir'd nothing so much as to become his Majesties Subjects, and fear'd nothing more then not to be so. The timely course that all the Province of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> took, doth sufficiently justifie what I have said, and it is likewise certain that had not the States gone in good time to <HI>Amster∣dam,</HI> the Inhabitants of that great Town were thinking of delivering us up the Keys: But those blood sucking Leeches, whose power would by this means have come to no∣thing, and who could no longer have fed up∣on and enrich'd themselves with the spoyles of the poor Subject, hinder'd their design,
<PB N="90" REF="47"/>inspiring into them a false and imaginary kind of courage, which they took from de∣spair, and by which they let themselves be misled, never thinking of that happiness and quiet which their neighbours did now en∣joy under the French Government, and how much they were pleas'd with the change. Their rejoycing at it did visibly appear, when they first heard the news of the birth of the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> which every body with one voice did congratulate; and for Joy Bon∣fires were made in all places, every body striving who should with most zeal shew his resentment of so welcome news. But it will not perhaps be impertinent here to inform the Reader how that this kind of Ceremony is by them perform'd in a much different way from what we do on the like occasions in France: for whereas we do generally as∣semble our selves together to some Public place, where a great Fire is made on the Public charge, no man contributing any thing more to it then he needs must, though he defire never so much to be thought a good Subject; with them on the contrary, every House-keeper makes a fire before his door, and the greater the fire it is the sign of the greater zeal; neither do they make their fires by piling of wood up, but fixing a stake, at the top of which they fasten pitch barrels and
<PB N="91" REF="47"/>such like combustible matter, which being lighted, they make merry and sing about it in the same manner as we do.</P>
<P>The 24 his Majesty sent a supply to <HI>Mon∣sieur,</HI> that he might hasten the reducing of <HI>Zutphen,</HI> where the same day we made our selves masters of a Sluce which did us good service in draining the ditch. The besiedg'd made a sally hoping to regain it, but they were beaten back into the Town without being able to do any thing. The Chevalier <HI>de Lorraine</HI> behav'd himself bravely on that occasion, and us'd them so severely that they have not since dar'd to shew themselves. The Regiments of <HI>Piedmont</HI> and <HI>des Vaisseaux</HI> were in their turns reliev'd by those of <HI>Ca∣stelnau</HI> and <HI>de la Reine,</HI> who gain'd the Coun∣terscarp, which put the Enemy into no little fright, so that they now began to reflect up∣on the desperate condition they were in.</P>
<P>M. <HI>de Turrenne</HI> seeing that the playing of the Cannon from <HI>Knotzemburg</HI> did not so work upon those of <HI>Nimegen,</HI> as to make them think of a surrender, prepar'd himself to lay a formal Siege to it.</P>
<P>As for Monsieur <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> when the Inhabitants of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> who had refus'd to admit a Dutch Garrison, or give Count <HI>Maurice</HI> passage, had put two of their Gates into his hands, he caus'd them to be kept
<PB N="92" REF="48"/>by his Musqueteers, and backd them with all the other forces he had with him, which were encamp'd over against S. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s Gate, on the border of the channel that goes hence to <HI>Leiden</HI> and so to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and then sent to give notice of what had pass'd to the King, on whom the Bishop of <HI>Strats∣bourg</HI> waited the same day.</P>
<P>The 25 the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI> made the King a visit, and after having made his ap∣pearance with the ordinary solemnity on such occasions, he had a private conference with him, which lasted a great while; and having din'd he return'd, having been presented by his Majesty with a Cross of Diamonds of great value; afterwards his Majesty gave audience to an Envoy extraordinary from the Elector of <HI>Tiers.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Roannez</HI> was ordered to go to <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> with 3 Ba∣tallions of the French Guards, as many of the Switzers, and two Companies of the life Guards, to relieve the Musqueteers who kept that place, and the horse who back't them.</P>
<P>The same day Monsieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> came and din'd with the King, and inform'd him of the obstinacy of the Garrison and Inha∣bitants of <HI>Nimegen;</HI> afterwards he return'd back to give such further orders as should be found necessary.</P>
<PB N="93" REF="48"/>
<P>At last <HI>Zutphen</HI> was reduced to that con∣dition, that the besieg'd began to beat a Parley betimes in the morning, and desir'd to capitulate. The Articles of Capitulation at all the places which have been won from the Hollander were in general the same, and therefore here as in other Places the Gar∣rison was made prisoners, and the place yeilded up without any other conditions. The Chevalier <HI>de Lorraine</HI> went to receive their Hostages, which were a Burgomaster and two of the Officers of the Garrison, whom he brought to his Royal Highness; who granted the Inhabitants as well here as in other places liberty of Conscience, and their Priviledges, and presently gave notice of the business to his Majesty: acquainting Him withall, that the number of his Pri∣soners was increas'd by 3000 foot and 250 horse, besides the Governor. I cannot but take this opportunity of doing Justice to <HI>Monsieur,</HI> in letting the World know that in this Siege he perform'd all that could be done by an expert General, and a valiant Soldier; he was very circumspect and watch∣full, look'd after every thing himself, and was always where there was the hottest service, going with an undaunted courage to the most dangerous place in all the Trenches, where many were kill'd round
<PB N="94" REF="49"/>about him, both with great and small shot, he remaining all the while fearless; so that the Chevalier <HI>de Lorraine</HI> was at last forc'd to beg of him by all means to retire from so evident danger, or at least to give him leave not to be in the same place with him, least if any harm should befall the Prince, he should be call'd to account for it.</P>
<P><HI>Zutphen</HI> is one of the cheif Towns of the Dutchy of <HI>Guelderland,</HI> and the Capitial of <HI>Zutphania,</HI> otherwise call'd the County of <HI>Zutphen,</HI> to which it gives the name. It is situated on the right bank of the <HI>Yssel,</HI> as it runs towards the <HI>Zuiderzee,</HI> just by the mouth of the river <HI>Borkel.</HI> It is one of the best and the strongest places the Hollanders had, it hath 9 Bastions almost all coated on the outside, 4 half Moons, 2 horn works, and without all this a very broad ditch, besides the inner one, which is twice as broad and flat bottom'd; it hath also trebble Ramparts, which make it strong almost beyond belief.</P>
<P><HI>Ysseltein, Oudewater, Buren,</HI> and <HI>Croanam∣burg,</HI> open'd their Gates and receiv'd Gar∣risons from Monsieur <HI>de Rochefort.</HI></P>
<P>The Count <HI>Maurice</HI> seeing himself so straitned, and closely pursu'd, imagining he should ere long be set upon, and not think∣ing himself strong enough to stand to it, re∣solv'd
<PB N="95" REF="49"/>at length to retire still further: and that he might be in some place where he might sleep safely a while, he got on the other side of a great Channel, which runs on the other side of <HI>Wesep,</HI> and quited <HI>Myen</HI> to our mercy, but because from thence there was a near way to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> they let out the waters all thereabouts.</P>
<P>We heard of the wounds which the Heer <HI>de Wit,</HI> the emprison'd Counselor, receiv'd within 100 paces of his own house, as he was returning home at midnight from an Assembly of the States; how he was set upon by 4 men, two of which were Citizens, and the other two Sons to a certain Coun∣sellour in the Court of Justice, who was likewise one of the States, called <HI>Vander Graef,</HI> who had given him divers stabbs in the head, neck, shoulder, and side, leaving him for dead; but that the Chirurgeons notwithstanding affirm'd his wounds not to be mortal, and gave some hopes of his life, though the Assassinates, who were taken, had little hopes of theirs. However this accident did not a little fright all men, especially the great ones, who now began to contrive how they might make an escape out of the Town, and were preparing to do it with all their Goods of value: but the multitude openly withstood their design, not suffering
<PB N="96" REF="50"/>so much as the Ministers of other Princes to depart.</P>
<P>The 26. The King left the Camp at <HI>Does∣burg,</HI> and went to a place called <HI>Biloin.</HI> The Sieur <HI>Groot</HI> (commonly call'd <HI>Grotius</HI>) who came to mediate Peace between the King and States, return'd without doing any thing. <HI>Monsieur</HI> sent Father <HI>Zocoli</HI> a Jesuite, and his Confessor, to <HI>Zutphen</HI> in the Morning, there to say Mass in a Tent which was pitcht for that purpose in the middle of the Town, and about 3 of the clock, after Dinner, made his entry into it, and view'd the Town with its Ramparts, and other Fortifications.</P>
<P>We heard the Hollander had quitted <HI>Gen∣nep,</HI> and that Monsieur the Count <HI>de Cha∣milly</HI> was gone to possess himself of it; and <HI>Grave</HI> seem'd not to intend any resolute resistance.</P>
<P>The 27. The King left <HI>Biloin,</HI> and ad∣vann'd towards <HI>Wagemingen,</HI> after having lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> orders that the Regiment <HI>de Vendosme</HI> should go and secure <HI>Arnhem.</HI> About 8 in the Morning, the second Bataillon of the <HI>Dauphins</HI> Regiment arrived at <HI>Amersford,</HI> together with some Horse, making up in all between 8 and 900 Men; some of which were to stay there, and some to march on to <HI>Naerden;</HI> so that their arrival gave liberty to the Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> and his Dragoons,
<PB N="97" REF="50"/>which were at <HI>Amersford,</HI> to go and joyn with the Marquis <HI>de Rochefort</HI> at <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> where the Duke <HI>de Roannez</HI> likewise ar∣riv'd with 4500 Men of the Regiment of <HI>Guards,</HI> and two Companies of the Life-Guards, but they enter'd not into <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> that day.</P>
<P>In the mean time the States at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> were not a little disquieted; they sat in Council every day, and could not any way be satisfied, till they had dispatch'd the Sieur <HI>Grotius</HI> back to the King in all hast, with new Orders, and a more ample and unlimit∣ed Commission. The Towns of <HI>Dort, Goud,</HI> and <HI>Roterdam,</HI> began openly to proclaim the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> Captain-General of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> misusing and Imprisoning some Burgomasters, who went about to op∣pose them in it, which made others more wary how they venter'd to displease an in∣cens'd multitude. Soon after all the rest follow∣ed their example; <HI>Amsterdam</HI> only excepted: which however a while after yielded, not∣withstanding all the shifts and devices which the States, to whom the Peoples Acclama∣tions on this occasion seem'd a very unwel∣come sound, contriv'd to divert it.</P>
<P><HI>Woerden</HI> also open'd its Gates, and receiv'd a Garrison from M. <HI>Rochefort. Woerden</HI> is a little Town, situate on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> five little
<PB N="98" REF="51"/>Leagues from <HI>Leiden:</HI> and therefore not far from the Camp where the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had retired, and in which he had intrench∣ed himself, being not a little troubled to see us Masters of that place; and advan∣cing so nimbly towards him, that he would not be able easily either to make an escape thence, or to enterprize any thing against us, though he should have desir'd it. The Ca∣stle belonging to this Town is very strong, and the whole Town secure from any sudden assault.</P>
<P>The 28. the King rais'd his Camp at two in the Morning, and went to encamp at <HI>A∣merongen,</HI> whither the Sieur <HI>Grotius</HI> came the same day. On the other side, Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> finding the obstinate Resolution of those of <HI>Nimegen,</HI> in which were 4500 Men in Garrison, order'd Faggots, Gabi∣ons, and other like Preparations to be made, resolving the next day to open his Trenches; and caus'd likewise his whole Army to pass the <HI>Wahal,</HI> that they might set upon the Town on the other side of the River, whilst the Fort plaid upon it from this.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Roannez</HI> enter'd <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> with his 3 Batallions of Guards to defend that place, whose strength consists more in the number of its Inhabitants (though they be very seditious, inconstant and waver∣ing)
<PB N="99" REF="51"/>then the goodness of its Fortificati∣ons, which are made up only of a pretty broad, but shallow Ditch, and a Rampart which is very much out of repair. But as to the Buildings of the Town, they are very stately, neat, and costly, especially in the heart of the Town. The little Rivolets which run through many of their Streets, do not a little contribute to the beauty of the place. The out-parts &amp; skirts of the town are likewise very pleasant, having many Canals; &amp; the entry into the town is very fine. There are many pleasant Houses scatter'd about, and the Suburbs are large and convenient; about which lie many rich Meadows and Pasture Grounds (stock'd with abundance of all sorts of Cattel) as far as one can see every way. Because the Burgomasters, when they came to yield up their Town, had desir'd to have no Garrison forc'd upon them, promising to defend the place them∣selves for his Majesty; and being they staid not till they were summon'd, but of their own accord had yielded up the place, it was resolv'd they should be thereupon consider'd and kindly used. And that they might have no reason to complain, M. <HI>de Roannez</HI> pitch'd his Tents upon the Rampart, where he still continu'd, as did likewise the rest of the Of∣ficers and Guards after his example. The
<PB N="100" REF="52"/>Musqueteers, who had kept the place ever since the Surrender, retir'd and encamp'd without <HI>St. Catharin</HI>'s Gate, with the Mar∣quis de <HI>Rochefort</HI>'s Army, upon the Bank of the River that runs hence to <HI>Rotterdam.</HI> The two Companies of Life-Guards enter'd the Town, and dispersed themselves into divers quarters of it, where they lay upon the Guard; and afterwards the Horse-Guards belonging to the <HI>Kings Houshold</HI> mounted the Guard by turns, relieving one another every Morning at six of the Clock.</P>
<P>The news of Count <HI>Maurice</HI>'s retiring still farther, was confirm'd to us, and that he had also broken down most of the Banks that kept out the Sea, having left only one which lay inwardmost standing; and that thereabouts he made Intrenchments, which he very carefully guarded, and fortified with divers pieces of Ordnance.</P>
<P><HI>Groot</HI> (or <HI>Grotius</HI>) in his passage, told M. <HI>de la Fueillade,</HI> That he had a Blank to pre∣sent to the King if he would treat, and so unlimited a Power granted him, as the States had never before given to any Pleni∣potentiary.</P>
<P>The 29. the King leaving <HI>Amerongen,</HI> went and encamped at <HI>Zeist</HI> and <HI>Stotwegen,</HI> where <HI>Grotius</HI> had Audience, and made his Proposals for a Peace, but without success;
<PB N="101" REF="52"/>for the King would not admit of them: so that being acquainted with the Kings Plea∣sure, he prepar'd for his departure the next day. Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> open'd his Trenches before <HI>Nimegen,</HI> where the be∣sieg'd behaved themselves like Men, that in∣tended to defend themselves resolutly, but without making any sally. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> drew out 70 Dragoons of the Regi∣ment <HI>Royal,</HI> to strengthen the Garrisons at <HI>Montfort</HI> and <HI>Isselsteing,</HI> and march'd with them himself to visit those places, and give such Orders as he should find necessary for the defence of them. The Count <HI>de la Mark</HI> was left sick at <HI>Ʋtrecht.</HI></P>
<P>The 30. Nothing extraordinary was done at the Kings Camp which lay at <HI>Zeist</HI> and <HI>Stotewegen.</HI> M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> proceeded on in his approaches before <HI>Nimegen,</HI> where the be∣sieged still defended themselves very vigo∣rously. The Marquis <HI>de Rochefort</HI> went out betimes to view and take notice what Forces lay upon the River that goes from <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> to <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> After Dinner <HI>Grotius</HI> re∣turn'd to <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> and thence to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> to acquaint the States with the Kings plea∣sure as it related to a Treaty of Peace, which was now diversly talked of.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="53"/>
<P>The first of <HI>July</HI> His Majesty lay still, and rested where he did before, and so continued until the 10<SUP>th</SUP>. The Marquis <HI>de Louvois,</HI> and of <HI>Pouange,</HI> came to <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> after dinner. The King in Person review'd his whole Army very strictly, and then issued out severe Pro∣hibitions to hinder any of his Army's wan∣dering from their own Colours, upon pain of certain death without mercy; so that whoever should offend, they should all be hang'd, and not hope that any should be put to the Lot for their Lives; with command likewise to all Officers, That they should bring in every Night to the Commander of each Body, the names of all such as had been absent from their Companies.</P>
<P>It was now reported, That a pail of fresh Water was worth 12 Stivers at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> which are equal to 15 French Sols.</P>
<P>The second of <HI>July,</HI> the Cardinal of <HI>Bou∣illon</HI> came to <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> where he was almost crowded to pieces by Roman Catho∣licks, who followed after him as an Angel sent from Heaven, praying him with much earnestness, to Bless and Consecrate the Churches of the Town. The Archbishop of the place himself desir'd it of him with much importunity, in the name of all the People; but he desir'd to be excused, till he should have order to do it from the King.
<PB N="103" REF="53"/>The Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>de Bouflers,</HI> Camp-master to the Regiment Royal of Dragoons, going over from <HI>Ʋ∣trecht</HI> to His Majesties Camp, which lay but two Leagues distant, were ordered to send two Companies of the said Regiment to the Count <HI>de Lorge,</HI> who was about four Leagues thence, drawing towards <HI>Arnhem</HI> with a fly∣ing Squadron, which made M. <HI>de Bouflers</HI> re∣turn post to <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> from whence he sent two Companies, that of <HI>de la Faye,</HI> and that of <HI>de la Rouillardiere.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monsieur,</HI> who 2 or 3 days before had joyn'd with the Kings Army, after the taking of <HI>Zu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phen</HI> went to <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> where he din'd with the Chevalier <HI>de Lorraine,</HI> who treated him very splendidly.</P>
<P>The night following there chanced to be a Fire in the Town, which burnt down two Houses; and we were told, That one of the 36 Burgomasters of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> who had been one of the 3 that had been against the giving up the Town to the King, when the Inhabitants would not resolve to acknow∣ledge the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> as the most part of the rest had done, we heard, I say, that this Burgomaster had received a Musket∣shot from a Sentinel, for not answering in time, when he was asked, Who goes there? and that he was in great danger of death by
<PB N="104" REF="54"/>it. And that the Sea finding no opposition, since the Count <HI>Maurice</HI>'s cutting down the Banks, did come into the Country with a dreadful impetuosity, and had already over∣whelmed a great part of the Country which lay between us and <HI>Amsterdam.</HI></P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> whom M. <HI>de Tu∣renne</HI> had ordered to march towards <HI>Gennep</HI> and <HI>Grave,</HI> and make himself master of them, arrived before <HI>Gennep,</HI> thinking the Inhabi∣tants, whom the Dutch Garrison had for∣saken, would without difficulty have yield∣ed it up, but found not what he expected: for a Colonel belonging to the <HI>Brandenbur∣ger,</HI> being ordered to put some Forces into it, and keep it as belonging to the Elector his Master, having performed his Orders, re∣fused to give it up to Monsieur <HI>de Chamilly.</HI> The truth is, this little Town, which is not extraordinarily strong, and lies upon the <HI>Meuse</HI> between <HI>Ruremonde</HI> and <HI>Grave,</HI> had formerly belong'd to the Duke of <HI>Branden∣bourg;</HI> but having been taken from him, and long possest by the Hollander, it was now no more reckoned to be his. Wherefore M. <HI>de Chamilly</HI> resolving not to be put off, sent him word, That unless he would be gon and leave the place to him, he would cer∣tainly put all his Men to the Sword, and hang
<PB N="105" REF="54"/>him without mercy. But the Colonel being not mov'd at this Threat, the Count <HI>de Cha∣milly</HI> made his Troops immediatly prepare to assault the place; but then the Colonel searing a dismal Halter, which he foresaw would be his fate if he stood out any longer, sent us word, That rather then disgrace his Family with being hang'd, he would con∣sent to any thing to avoid such an ignomini∣ous death; wherefore, he desired to be used as an Officer of the Duke of <HI>Brandenbourgs,</HI> who having not as yet declared himself, ought not to be reckon'd nor used as an Ene∣my; he therefore desired, he might freely march off and return to the place from whence he came; and earnestly entreated M. <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> that least he should be hang'd at his return for not maintaining the place, he would give him an Certificate under his Hand, that he was ready to give an Assault to the place, and had threatned to hang him before he yielded it up; which having been granted him, he retir'd into the next Garrison, as well satisfied as if he had gained some great Victory, or done some memorable exploit. So that the Count <HI>Cha∣milly</HI> presently ordered his Men to enter the place; and then marched towards <HI>Grave,</HI> whose Garrison was retir'd, and which was
<PB N="106" REF="55"/>now in the possession of the Sieur <HI>Cleodore,</HI> who by order from M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> kept the place with 40 or 50 <HI>Maistres.</HI></P>
<P>The third, the Marquis <HI>de Louvoys</HI> went and visited the Town-house of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> and commanding the Maps of the Country to be brought him, informed himself of the number, bigness, and other qualities of the Channels which compass'd the Prince of <HI>O∣range</HI>'s Camp; that being before-hand in∣structed in these matters, he might be ready to go and attaque him in case a Peace were not concluded. It must be confess'd, that the prudence and conduct of the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> are almost incredible; he hath manag'd things in this Campagne, as he doth all things else, with marvelous vigilancy, care and success. The Kings Troops, the care of which lay wholly upon him, were the best order'd that might be; nothing was wanting in the Army: he had taken such care for all things necessary, that the King need∣ed only wish that things should be done, and they were so. He found in that Man an inexhaustible Treasure of all those good Qualities which fit a Man for ordering bu∣siness dextrously; he had establish'd such good Orders, and such a way of living a∣mong the Soldiers, that they found them∣selves as well accommodated as if they had
<PB N="107" REF="55"/>been in <HI>Paris,</HI> and that without any way being grievous to the Countrys where they lay. There were every where continual Fairs and Markets, to which Merchants, Vi∣ctualers, and Country people resorted, with as much security as to St. <HI>Laurence</HI>'s Fair. In a word, he so well contriv'd all things, that we never wanted any thing.</P>
<P>After Dinner the King came to the Camp, and having walked about it and view'd his Troops, without causing them to take Horse; he also rounded the out-side of the Town, and then went into it likewise, but <HI>incognito.</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> continu'd still battering <HI>Nimegen,</HI> which did still couragiously de∣fend it self. Notwithstanding, he dispatch'd a Courier to the King, to tell Him, he hop'd that very day to spring a Mine, or that at farthest it would be sprung the next day. The Sieur <HI>de Carman,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the <HI>Champagne</HI> Regiment, was killed before this place.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Lorge</HI> made his Men labor hard all day about making a Bridge over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> that by it he might get into the <HI>Betaw.</HI> The News of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s being chosen Statholder, and Protector of their Country, by all the Towns of the United Provinces, except only <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> was con∣firm'd to us, and at the same time the Sieur
<PB N="108" REF="56"/><HI>Groot,</HI> who was this day to return and bring the King an answer about the ratification of the Peace, instead of coming himself, sent to desire, That his time might be prolong'd two days more, which were accordingly granted him. It is to be noted, That His Maje∣sty would treat with him not as coming from the States (whose Authority he would not acknowledge) but only as from the Peo∣ple of Holland.</P>
<P>The fourth, nothing extraordinary hap∣ned in the Kings Army, which continued rest∣ing and refreshing it self after all the hard∣ship it had undergon. M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> after having had his design of mining <HI>Ni∣megen</HI> twice frustrated by Countermines, at length, notwithstanding all the Enemies care and pains to hinder it, almost finish'd one; so that they finding they should ere long have a breach made in their Walls, and be forced to endure an assault, and come to handy∣blows with the French (which they feared above all things, as knowing how good our Nation is at that kinde of Service, and how dangerous it is to fall into their hands) re∣solv'd at last to come to a Composition. The Count <HI>de Saulx</HI> had a piece of his Breeches shot off, and one of his Servants kill'd with him by a great shot before this place, which gave occasion to the spreading of a rumor,
<PB N="109" REF="56"/>that he was dead, and made him as much lamented in the Kings Army, as if he really had been so.</P>
<P>The fifth, at break of day, 2 Horse-men from <HI>Naerden</HI> came to Monsieur <HI>de Rochfort,</HI> to give him notice of the Count <HI>Maurice</HI>'s last retreat, and how he had cut down the Banks and let in the <HI>Zuiderzee,</HI> whose far∣ther course was now stopp'd by nothing but only one Dike, which was only broad enough for 3 Horse to march abreast on. At the same time M. <HI>de Rochfort</HI> dispatch'd a Cou∣rier to the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> to give him notice of it, and M. <HI>de Roannes</HI> drew out a party of the <HI>Life Guards,</HI> which were of the Guard at <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> and some of the Kings Men at Arms, who were come thither, &amp; sent them under the Command of the M. <HI>d'Am∣bre,</HI> to view and take cognizance of the Post which the Enemy now possest. They did ac∣cordingly, and stood within Pistol-shot of their Intrenchments two long hours, none of the Enemies in the mean time daring to come out towards them; only they were free of their Musket-shot, which yet did no harm, so that our Men came back just as they went: which is an infallible token of the Dutch cowardize, who dar'd not stir out when they might have cut the whole Party to pieces: and though they had fear'd some
<PB N="110" REF="57"/>ambush, yet might they have come round in their Barks, and set on them behind with∣out any danger of being any way surpriz'd, being sure of a safe retreat when ever they desir'd it. Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> at length be∣came master of <HI>Nimegen,</HI> which yielded up∣on the same terms as others had done, only the Governor and other chief Officers had li∣berty to depart with all their Baggage.</P>
<P><HI>Nimegen</HI> is a very great Town, and full of Inhabitants, situate on the left side of the <HI>Wahal,</HI> which runs by its Walls, and sepa∣rates it from the Fort of <HI>Knotzembourg;</HI> it lies high on one side, and low on the other. On the higher part of the Town stands an old Castle, which is still strong enough, and commands both the Town and River. The lower part is plentifully furnish'd with Tow∣ers, Bastions, and Half-moons of an exces∣sive bigness, and upon that account they need more Men to defend it then we do in our Towns, who are more concern'd to have them well lined and flanck'd. Those who have Travell'd in Holland, may have ob∣serv'd the prodigious dimensions of all parts of their Fortifications, so that each Work requires as many Men almost to defend it, as a whole Town of ours.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Count <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> who was march'd towards <HI>Grave,</HI> found
<PB N="111" REF="57"/>strange alterations there, as well as he had at <HI>Gennep.</HI> Some of the States, either those that were at <HI>Maestricht,</HI> or others, hearing that their Garrison had so causelesly quitted the Town, which is very strong, and whose Works are in very good repair; and know∣ing withal that there were not in it above 40 or 50 of our Men, sent a command to the Governor that had quitted it, to return thither and defend it upon pain of death; and ordered the Governor of the <HI>Busse</HI> to give him all possible assistance in case of need. Wherefore, upon this Order he was forc'd to turn back again, and the Governor of the <HI>Buss</HI> took with him 33 Companies of Foot, and 100 Horse, to go and perform what was commanded him. There being as yet no Garrison put into the place, and the Townsmen refusing to keep the Gates, it was easie for him who came before in hast with 100 <HI>Maistres</HI> to enter the Town, whil'st the Foot followed softly after; though as it prov'd, they made too much hast to their own misfortune. He therefore visits the place, and reckons upon those Men of ours which he found there, as so many Prisoners. But whilst this was doing, the Van of the Count <HI>de Chamilly</HI>'s Army was discover'd, and he withal gave notice of his coming, which was but ill news for the new Con∣queror,
<PB N="112" REF="58"/>who by this means was not like to wear his Laurel long. Hereupon the Towns∣men began to change their note, and declar'd they would not suffer themselves to be plun∣dered by us, and therefore bid the Gover∣nor shift for himself, which he could no o∣therwise do, then by sending to desire a Pass from M. <HI>Chamilly,</HI> that he might come and capitulate with him, which he did, and was suffer'd to return again to the <HI>Busse</HI> with his 100 Horse; he mentioned not the Foot in the capitulation, which he thought was so far behind, that he might easily give them notice to retire homewards and none of us the wiser. But to their misfortune he was out in his calculation, for M. <HI>de Joyeuse</HI> met with them, who though he had then with him but a small party of the Brigade of Horse which he commands (the rest being gone before under command of the Marquis <HI>de Tury,</HI> to recover the Town) he fell upon them so fu∣riously, that they had only time to make one discharge at us. In this Encounter most of the Enemy were kill'd, and the rest taken, so that there hardly escap'd one to carry home the bad news: we got at this bout 33 Colours.</P>
<P>The night that follow'd, and the sixth day, there hapned a Fire in the Kings Quarters, which began in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
<PB N="113" REF="58"/>House, and burnt down together with some others; the damage the Duke had by it was computed to amount to 100000 Crowns. The fire reached the Kings Stable, and de∣stroyed many Horses and their harness, and at last grew so dreadful, that the King was forced to rise, least the fire should also come to his Appartment; many of his Pages having had their cloths burnt.</P>
<P>We heard of the ill success of Monsieur <HI>de Nancrud</HI>'s attempt upon <HI>Ardemburg,</HI> which had faild by his guides and spies saults, these having misinform'd, and the other misled him. The Particulars of that business were as follows; Word was brought to him that the Garrison was both very small and also negligent, which made him resolve to try if he could surprize it; and to that purpose he order'd his march so as to ar∣rive before the Place at midnight, with a design to attaque it in four several places at once, but it so happen'd, his Guides either not being sufficiently acquainted with the Country, or mistaking their way in the dark, that his whole party met at the same place, and so were for∣c'd to make their attaque all on one side of the Town; which being perform'd very couragiously, they beat out the Enemy and gained a half Moon, which Post design∣ing
<PB N="114" REF="59"/>greater things they cared not to secure from the Enemy's shot; but day at last be∣gining to break, the Enemy who had re∣ceiv'd supplies from <HI>Sluice,</HI> now made more vigorous resistance; and having discover'd our men, who lay leuel and open to their shot, kill'd many of them, so that they were forc'd to retire with loss of 1000 or 1200 men.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> went to <HI>Isselstaing</HI> and <HI>Monfort,</HI> leading thither some Dragoons to reinforce those Garrisons. The same day about evening, the King came to visit <HI>Ʋ∣trecht;</HI> and he was scarce gone thence when the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Arlington,</HI> Embassadors from the King of England arriv'd, hoping to have found his Majesty there, to whom they were sent by the King their Master.</P>
<P>The 7 the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Arlington</HI> went from <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> to the Camp at <HI>Zeist,</HI> where the King presently gave them Audience, after which a Courier was dispatch'd to the King of England, who was mightily sollicited by the Dutch Mi∣nisters to a Peace.</P>
<P>The Enemy came and attaqu'd <HI>Oudwater,</HI> and beat back our horse Guard, after hav∣ing killed 5 or 6 of them with the like loss on their side, but the Alarm being streight
<PB N="115" REF="59"/>given to Monsieur <HI>de Rochefort,</HI> he present∣ly went to their assistance, as did also the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> with his <HI>Regiment Royal</HI> of Dragoons, but they at their arrival found the Enemy retir'd, so that all these sup∣plies kept a guard all that night upon the Place. The Musqueteers, who ever since the surrender of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> had been either within the Town to secure it, or encamp'd just be∣fore it with Monsieur <HI>de Rochesorts</HI> Army, return'd now to the Kings Camp at <HI>Zeist,</HI> a part of whose Guard they were. The three Bataillons of the Regiment of Guards, w<SUP>ch</SUP> the Duke <HI>de Roannez</HI> had with him in the same place, did the like, and in their stead were sent thither, one Bataillon of the Kings, and another of the Queens Regiment, the Regiment of <HI>Castelnan,</HI> the Royal Re∣giment <HI>de la Marine,</HI> and that of <HI>Suitzers,</HI> whose Colonel is the Sieur <HI>Stouppe,</HI> who also commanded the Place, as belonging of right to him whilst that the King had yet appoint∣ed no Governour of it. The rest of the Re∣giment of <HI>Turenne</HI> was sent to <HI>Naerden,</HI> to relieve those of the <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s which lay there, and many foot were sent to reinforce M. <HI>de Rochefort</HI>'s Army, which his Majesty in∣tended to leave about <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> as well to keep all that part of the Country quiet, as to hinder the Hollanders Armys, which lay
<PB N="116" REF="60"/>not far off, from attemting any thing up∣on the new conquered places that lay that way.</P>
<P>The eight in the morning, Monsieur <HI>de Rochefort</HI> order'd some powder and shot to be sent to <HI>Oudewater,</HI> with a Convoy of horse, and then he returned with the Troops he had brought the day before. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> came back also with his <HI>Regiment Royal</HI> of Dragoons: The King prepar'd to leave <HI>Zeist;</HI> and the Cardinal <HI>de Boüillon</HI> went and consecrated the Church of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> which was perform'd with great pomp, to the great Joy of an infinite number of Ro∣man Catholicks, who impatiently expected that day.</P>
<P>The 9, the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> return∣ed to the Kings Army, with the Marquis <HI>de la Valiere,</HI> having left his Baggage and Equippage near <HI>Emerick,</HI> and the command of his Army to the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> who came likewise to give the King a visit, and then returned towards <HI>Frizeland,</HI> where since he hath done the Enemy much harm. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> who during all this Cam∣pagne had commanded the <HI>Regiment Royal</HI> of Dragoons, left that, and took the com∣mand of the Regiment <HI>Colonel,</HI> and went to the Kings Camp to follow his Majesty. The next day, the Prince who had been
<PB N="117" REF="60"/>conveyed to <HI>Arnhem,</HI> and continued there ever since his Majesty left that place, found himself worse then he had been of his wounds, and was much tormented with a fit of the Gout.</P>
<P>The King gave 8000 <HI>livres,</HI> among those who had lost their horses in the late fire.</P>
<P>The 10 the King left <HI>Zeist</HI> (which lyes within 2 leagues of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI>) where he had lain 8 days, and went back to encamp be∣tween <HI>Rhenen</HI> and <HI>Wageningen.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> went to the Camp before <HI>Ʋ∣trecht</HI> to command that Army, which M. the Marquis <HI>de Rochefort</HI> left to follow the King; which Army was found to consist of between 15000 and 16000 men.</P>
<P>The 11 in the morning, the King went and encamped in the Suburbs of <HI>Arnhem,</HI> the Government of which, together with those of <HI>Nimegen,</HI> the whole Isle of <HI>Betaw,</HI> and <HI>Grave,</HI> he bestowed on the Count <HI>de Lorge,</HI> with a pension of 1000 Crowns monthly, M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who had march'd with his Army towards <HI>Grave,</HI> came to wait on his Majesty soon after his arrival, and having assisted at the Council which was held, returned and lay at <HI>Nimegen.</HI> The weather which had some days threatned a change, at last became very fowl, and from this day forward, rain, wind, and cold did
<PB N="118" REF="61"/>as much trouble us, as if it had been the middle of Winter, till we returned again into the Climate of <HI>France.</HI> This stormy weather was very favorable to many Towns, which otherwise would certainly have been taken as others had been.</P>
<P>The 12, the King left <HI>Arnhem,</HI> and having passed the <HI>Rhine,</HI> over a Bridge of Boats made for that purpose a little below the Town, marched through the Isle <HI>Betaw,</HI> and passed the <HI>Wahal</HI> also upon a Float over against <HI>Nimegen,</HI> where he lay that night. All the former night and this day we wrought hard in making a Bridge, to pass over the Army, Artillery, and Baggage, but not being able to sinish it time enough, one part of the Army was forced to stay in the Isle till the next day. Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> left <HI>Ni∣megen</HI> betimes in the morning, and went to <HI>Grave,</HI> where he found his Army pas∣sing the <HI>Meuse,</HI> over a bridge of boats which had been, made above the Town, and the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> met there a part of the Regiment <HI>Colonel</HI> of Dragoons, which had staid there for the defence of the Place, whilst the rest were gone to joyn with the Count <HI>de Chamilly</HI>'s Army, which lay beyond the <HI>Busse,</HI> between that Town, <HI>Heusden</HI> and the Fort <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> at a place called <HI>Ʋly∣men.</HI> As soon as the whole Army had pas∣sed
<PB N="119" REF="61"/>the River, we march'd on and went to encamp at <HI>Bergen,</HI> which is within three leagues of <HI>Grave.</HI></P>
<P>We must not forget to let you know, that <HI>Grave,</HI> though it be but a little Town, yet is one of the prettiest, pleasantest, strong∣est, and easilyest defended places, that I have seen. It is situated on the right bank of the <HI>Meuse,</HI> which does very much strength∣en it on that side, and on the other side it hath a great marsh, always full of water, which makes it inaccessible at all times, be∣sides it hath excellent Fortifications, and in good repair, but above all a great Horn∣work very well secured with a covered way, which goes to the very Gate, with excel∣lent Ravelins, besides a good Counterscarp, and a Pallisado which is but newly made, and is in very good order, and strong Bul∣warks: so that I may truly say that I have not seen in <HI>Holland</HI> a prettier Town, better in order, or in a likelier condition to defend it self. It hath been often taken and re∣taken, the first time was in the year 1586, when the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> besiedged it, and had it surrendred to him upon Articles; and then it was again retaken in 1602, by Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Nassau,</HI> and since hath conti∣nued in their possession.</P>
<P>The 13, because of the Bridges not being
<PB N="120" REF="62"/>time enough in readiness the day before, the King kept at <HI>Nimegen,</HI> whilst the rest of the Army all that day pass'd over from the Isle of <HI>Betaw.</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> passed from <HI>Bergen</HI> in the morning, and encamped at a Village call'd <HI>Hempel,</HI> within a league of the <HI>Busse,</HI> and half a league from <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> and immediately set his men to work about making a bridge over against his Camp, and at the end of the bridge rais'd a Redout to keep the Enemy from putting any suc∣cours into <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> which he intended to besiege.</P>
<P>The 14 the King left <HI>Nimegen,</HI> and march∣ed towards <HI>Grave,</HI> where he passed the <HI>Meuse,</HI> and encamp'd on the left side of that River. Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> went and view'd the Fort of <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> and though news came that the Inhabitants of <HI>Bommelle</HI> had sent to the King to capitulate, he not∣withstanding sent a Trumpet to summon it. M. <HI>de Montauban</HI> advanced on the other side of the <HI>Busse</HI> with 4000 horse. The weather began to make the Country almost unpas∣sable; the cold, rain, and wind grew very troublesome, so that we could hardly find the Causseys, though there be no going any where else, the whole Country being nothing but marshes and dikes.</P>
<P>The 15 his Majesty left <HI>Grave,</HI> and came
<PB N="121" REF="62"/>within a league of <HI>Boxtel,</HI> a little Town near the <HI>Busse,</HI> but of very great importance, be∣cause it commands the Sluces, which either keep in, or let out the waters, all over this part of the Country. But at this time they had no great need of them, the rain having already so plentifully fallen, that all about the Town was overflown, which hinder'd us from besieging it, as we before design'd.</P>
<P>The Bridge which Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> had ordered to be made over the <HI>Meuse,</HI> for communication between his Camp and the Isle of <HI>Bommelle,</HI> was now finished; he ordered 10000 Faggots to be prepared, and view'd the Fort again, which he found to be a very good one, and that it commands the Sluces below the <HI>Busse,</HI> as <HI>Boxtel</HI> doth above it. It hath 5 good and large Bastions, though they be not coated: the Garrison consisted of 800 men, who might well de∣fend the Place, which was secured on one side by the River, and on the other by a great unpassable Marsh, and which (had we not provided against it by setting a guard on the passage) might have kept correspon∣dence with the <HI>Busse,</HI> and been releiv'd and assisted from thence as oft as they would.</P>
<P>The 16 the King went to <HI>Boxtel,</HI> where he found no resistance. Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> as soon as the Faggots he had order'd were
<PB N="122" REF="63"/>ready, made the horse carry them, and in the evening caused the Trenches to be open∣ed by the Regiments <HI>de Champagne, Lyonnois,</HI> and <HI>de Louvigny,</HI> who advanced them very far, and raised a Battery on that side where the <HI>Champagne</HI> Regiment was, whereon were planted two peices of Canon, which were ready to play by day break. They likewise very much forwarded another, which was began in the <HI>Lyonnois</HI> Regiment's quarters, to plant 8 peices on. The besiedged, who were certainly by the ill season lulled a sleep, and thought it not possible we should work in such tempestuous weather, discharg'd not above 7 or 8 Guns at us, which hurt no body. The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> who, as we said, staid at <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> with 15 or 16000 men, encamped without S. <HI>Catharin</HI>'s Gate, chang'd his quarters, and passing the Canale which runs from thence to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> went beyond a part of the Suburbs which lies on the other side, and encamped not far from the Town, between it and <HI>Naerden,</HI> after having defeated a party of the Enemy, who had set upon his van-Guard.</P>
<P>The 17 the King rested with all his Army at <HI>Boxtel,</HI> and departed not thence till he return'd for <HI>France.</HI> In the morning as we said the <HI>Lyonnois</HI> Regiment's Battery began to play upon <HI>Crevccoeur,</HI> and beat down a
<PB N="123" REF="63"/>Redout which lay on the left side of the Fort toward the River, so that some Sol∣diers which were in it were forced to aban∣don it, and retire to their fellows in the Fort it self; afterwards 100 <HI>Grenadiers</HI> were placed upon the Channel that comes from the <HI>Busse,</HI> to hinder the communication of the Enemy with that place, and a Serjeunt with 20 men lodged about 30 paces from the declivity of the works, behind the ruines of a Redout, which the Enemy had quitted and fired some days before. The Grand Ma∣ster of the Artillery came and brought with him 16 peices of Canon, 8 of which were sent to be mounted on the Battery fi∣nished the night before in the <HI>Champagne</HI> Re∣giments quarter. The Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> took with him all the Dragoons that were in M. <HI>de Turennes</HI> Army after dinner, and went with them to the Count <HI>de Chamilly's,</HI> with whom was the rest of the <HI>Ʋlymen</HI> Camp: this Army was likewise now busied in car∣rying Faggots, to set upon <HI>Crevecoeur</HI> on their side also.</P>
<P>The 18 his Majesty kept at <HI>Boxtel,</HI> where nothing extraordinary happened. The Battery of 8 peices of Canon which was begun the night before by the <HI>Lyonnois</HI> Regiment before <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> was finish'd and ready to play by break of day; and the Enemy soon were
<PB N="124" REF="64"/>made sensible of it by having 6 of their Guns dismounted in a little time; on the Count <HI>Cha∣milly</HI>'s side, Trenches were likewise open'd, from w<SUP>ch</SUP> they gave a false Alarm. M. <HI>de la. Fo∣rest</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the Dragoons, went in the morning, and caused all the Trees about the Avenues of his Camp to be fell'd to hinder the Enemy, who was very strong in <HI>Heusden,</HI> from setting on him behind, but they attemted no such thing; on the con∣trary the Marquis <HI>de Ranes,</HI> after dinner ac∣companied by some of his Dragoons, march'd towards them, and beat back their Guards, and made them retire within their Pallisado, on purpose to entice them out to fight, but none of them stirr'd, only some volleys of small shot were let fly at us from their works. In the mean time, the Duke of <HI>Buc∣kingham</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Arlington,</HI> the En∣glish Ambassadors, having dispatch'd their business, took leave, and returned by <HI>Brus∣sels,</HI> that so they might require the Count <HI>Monterey,</HI> the Governor of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> to withdraw all the Spanish Forces from the Dutch service, or upon his refusal to de∣nounce War against him in the name of the King of <HI>England;</HI> and tell him that he would immediately fall to acts of hostility against the Spaniard. Monsieur <HI>de Villacerre</HI> ac∣companied them to be a witness of their
<PB N="125" REF="64"/>Conference, and the English and French Fleet came up as far as the <HI>Texel,</HI> with design to land, if he refused assent to the proposal: but the Count <HI>de Monterey</HI> made answer, that the business was of such importance as he could not answer till he had acquainted his Superiors with it, and therefore desired time till he might send to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and then he would act according to the instructions he should receive thence.</P>
<P>An Officer that went a pickering with a party of Horse towards <HI>Breda,</HI> met with a party of the Enemy, and though ours was but 30 against 80, he made them give ground, and after someresistance wholly routed them: but 500 Peasants, which had gathered to∣gether, and strongly intrenched themselves endeavour'd to cut off the retreat of our men, so that they were feign to force their way, w<SUP>ch</SUP> they did happily enough through their first barricado, but when they came to the second, the case was altered, for the Peasants had sent to the routed party of the Enemy, to bid them rally and set on our men behind, whilst they would oppose them before, and stop their passage. The project took so well that they defeated our party, and though there were not many killed upon the place, yet it fared the worse with them that scaped; for falling into the hands of the Peasants,
<PB N="126" REF="65"/>there was no sort of cruelty which they en∣dured not from them; but they were not long unrevenged, for the King hearing of their barbarous usage the same evening, pre∣sently ordered a party to go and put all those Villages to fire and sword.</P>
<P>On the 19, which was the day following, the Chevasier <HI>Fourille</HI> marched out by break of day with the Brigades <HI>de la Feuillée</HI> and <HI>de Roye,</HI> and 200 Dragoons which M. <HI>de Ranes</HI> had sent him, under the command of the Chevalier <HI>de Tilladet,</HI> Camp master to the Regiment <HI>Collonel,</HI> with orders to burn, plunder, and put to the sword all that they should meet; and accordingly they burnt and plundered the Villages: but the Peasants having heard of the design, were for the most part fled, so that few of them fell into our hands; but being very near <HI>Breda,</HI> some Dragoons who were commanded to set fire at any place where they could, went up to the very Gates of the Town, and there fired some houses whilst the rest of the party and the Horse defended them; this troubled the Town a little, who thought sure there∣upon that we were coming to besiege them.</P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> finding we should now soon be in a condition to assault the Place, resolved to stand out no longer, and that he might get the better conditions,
<PB N="127" REF="65"/>went himself to make them; so he came forth and desired to speak with M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who gave order he should be civilly intreated, but would not see him. He only disarmed the Garrison, and because we had more Pri∣soners then we could well tell what to do with, he had them all conducted a league from the Place, and there gave them their liberty, as he had done before to those of <HI>Nimegen,</HI> among which he had found 500 or 600 Citizens of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> whom he sent to their own homes.</P>
<P><HI>Hinkel</HI> which is a little Fort between the <HI>Busse</HI> and <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> was taken by the Count <HI>de Chamilly,</HI> with more ease then he himself did expect: for the Garrison either being frighted, or having heard that we intended to assault them, quited it after having set fire on their powder and the houses of the Fort, a part of which were notwithstand∣ing saved.</P>
<P>The 20, the King, who continued still at <HI>Boxtel,</HI> having heard of the surrender of <HI>Crevecoeur,</HI> came and viewed the Fort, and afterwards returned, whilst M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> passed over the Island of <HI>Bommelle,</HI> and sent and summoned the Town which bears the same name. The Inhabitants were at a stand what answer to make, on one side they found not themselves in a condition to hold
<PB N="128" REF="66"/>out a long Siege, and despaired of being relieved; they likewise saw that many Towns better fortified and Garrison'd then they, had not been able with all their strength to defend themselves; and that all the Country round about them was already in our pos∣session; but on the other side also they re∣membred that they had formerly born up against all the fury of 25000 Spanish foot, when their Fortifications were by no means in so good a condition as at present: and besides a certain little Collonel, who had before been in <HI>Nimegen</HI> whilst we besiedged it (and who would have still been among the rest of our Prisoners had he not been re∣leased) and was afterwards made Governor of this Town, thought himself engaged in honour of which he had much bragged to M. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> not so lightly to yeild up a Place of that importance; wherefore we were forced to set on them, and as we came before the Place, the Guides brought M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> so near that a Cannon bullet, which had been shot from the Town, fell just at his feet; but that hindered not our proceed∣ings, we therefore went and encamped at <HI>Stelst;</HI> which is a little Village lying upon the River, within Canon shot below the Town.</P>
<PB N="129" REF="66"/>
<P>Whilst the Kings Quarters were prepa∣ring, some attendants, having retired them∣selves into a certain grove to refresh them∣selves till a house should be appointed them for their Master, perceiv'd the ground had lately been turn'd up there, which gave them the curiosity to search if nothing were hid∣den underneath, whereupon one of them felt with his sword, and finding some re∣sistance, uncovered the place before some Officers that were then come thither, and there found 28 dead bodies newly kill'd, piled one upon the other, divers of which those Officers knew to have been our horse.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Chamilly</HI> left <HI>Ʋlymen,</HI> and went over with his Army to Monsieur <HI>de Turennes</HI> Army at <HI>Hempel,</HI> and in the mean time order'd the fort of <HI>Hainkel</HI> to be slighted.</P>
<P>The 21 about 10 in the morning, the be∣sieged in <HI>Bommel,</HI> who from the top of their works could easily see that we were en∣camped upon the River, ventur'd out of the Town, without any opposition, fill'd a <HI>Fregate,</HI> which carried 4. or 5 pieces of Canon, with Soldiers, and coming down the River ere we were aware of them, arriv'd over against our Camp, where they landed and made a discharge of their muskets and Canon loaded with small shot, amongst our Tents,
<PB N="130" REF="67"/>by which they kill'd some few of our Ca∣valiers, and many of their horses: thereupon some of our men made up to them, and our foot beating them back to the River side, shew'd them so much vigour and courage in the Skirmish, that they retir'd to the other side of the River, which is out of Musket shot. They came back however two or three times to discharge again, but were still repulsed, though not without difficulty and the loss of some men; for the Marquis de <HI>Ranes</HI> having got between the Town and them at a place where the River is much narrower, forc'd them to stand one of our discharges, which they did, but not to be behind hand with him, answered it with their Muskets and Canon charged as be∣fore; so that one Dragoon lost an arm, and another a leg. But as ill fortune for them would have it, the fire caught in their pow∣der room, and so fired one end of their Vessel, whereupon 7 or 8 of them for fear of being burnt, flung themselves into the water, where they all perish'd, being either drown'd or killed by our men, who were skirmishing on the shore, this accident fright∣ed them so, that from that time forward they dared not venter out. At the same time Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> ordered Faggots to be made, and sent a Trumpet to summon the
<PB N="131" REF="67"/>Place once again, the besiedged let him in, and went to counsel, which lasted 5 or 6 hours, wherefore M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> sent M. <HI>Baleroy,</HI> a Captain of horse, with another Trumpet, to enquire what was become of the first, the Governor desired M. <HI>de Bale∣roy</HI> to come in, which he did, and they as∣sured him they would surrender, beseeching him to desire M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> to send Articles, which he thereupon presently did. In the mean time, M. <HI>de S. Abre,</HI> who was Lieu∣tenant general that day, not to loose any time, caused Faggots to be carried, and way made for the Canon, which he brought forward, and when night drew on, he be∣gan to open the Trenches, but proceeded not far in them, because the besiedged sent back the Articles sign'd.</P>
<P>An hour or two after dinner, a <HI>Fregate</HI> with men to put into <HI>Bommel,</HI> came up the River from <HI>Worcum,</HI> (or <HI>Gorcum</HI>) but having been made more cautious by what happen'd in the morning, we had plac'd a <HI>Corps de Garde</HI> on divers places of the Banks, so that they could not pass, and were forc'd to go back as they came, after having made a discharge or two of their Muskets and Ca∣non charged with small shot. By which a∣mongst others poor M. <HI>Clodoré</HI> (whom we had occasion to mention before, for making
<PB N="132" REF="68"/>the Capitulation at <HI>Grave,</HI> and the history of whose life was known to many) was kill'd, one half of his head having been taken off. At length, the Place being yeilded up in the evening, one Monsieur <HI>d'Espagne</HI> was made Governor of it the next morning, and there were put into it 4 Companies of <HI>Switzers</HI> and the Regiment <HI>de la Ferté</HI> for a Gar∣rison.</P>
<P><HI>Bommel</HI> is a great Town, situate (as we said) on the left bank of the <HI>Wahal,</HI> 3 leagues above <HI>Gorcum;</HI> its situation is very advantagious both upon the account of the <HI>Wahal,</HI> which defends one side of it, and of the Marshes which encompass it on the other, and which are so deep that one can neither undermine nor keep Trenches long open before it. Its Fortifications are likewise good, and the Hollander who have made it one of the Keys of their Country, have not forgot to keep them in repair, but made its preservation one of their cheif cares. It is surrounded with good Cortin's, Bastions and Towers, a double Rampart, and a double ditch. It was besiedg'd in 1599 for the <HI>Spaniard</HI> by Don <HI>Francesco de Mendoza</HI> high Admiral of <HI>Arragon,</HI> who after many stra∣tagems, at last vented all his fury upon this Place, which he besieged with 30000 men, but was notwithstanding forced after a fort∣night's
<PB N="133" REF="68"/>stay to raise his Siege. By which we may judge of the strength and consequence of this Place.</P>
<P>The 22, after a Garrison had been put into <HI>Bommel,</HI> the whole Island became sub∣ject to the King, the Forts of S. <HI>Andrew</HI> and of <HI>Wornes</HI> being already possest by our Dra∣goons, Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> departed hence with his Army, and came back to <HI>Hempel,</HI> where being to march through the Town he din'd. The Artillery by reason of the bad ways having not been able to keep pace with the Army, came behind under the Convoy of the Dragoons. Those who had been drawn out on the 19 to fire the Villages, whose Peasants had beaten and so barbarously used our party, returned after having routed 100 foot and 50 <HI>Maistres</HI> of <HI>Breda,</HI> which they met with. Monsieur <HI>de Montauban</HI> was made Governor of <HI>Zutphen,</HI> M. <HI>de Beauvezé</HI> of <HI>Rees,</HI> and M. <HI>de Villiers</HI> of <HI>Doesburg.</HI> This day there arriv'd at <HI>Boxtel</HI> an <HI>Envoye</HI> from the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> with many Proposi∣tions for a Peace; which made the World think it would at last come to something.</P>
<P>The 23 after the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s <HI>En∣voy</HI> had made known his Propositions, the King ordered a Drummer to go with him to <HI>Brussells,</HI> that he might know the Count <HI>de Monterey</HI>'s answer to the Duke of <HI>Buc∣kingham</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="69"/>and the Earl of <HI>Arlington</HI>'s demands in the King of <HI>England</HI>'s name, which was to call back all the Spanish Forces that were either in <HI>Breda,</HI> the <HI>Busse, Bergen-op Zoom,</HI> or the Dutch Army's. M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> came to wait on his Majesty at <HI>Boxtel,</HI> and lay there that night following, and his Army the while rested at <HI>Hompel,</HI> whether the Ordnance being arriv'd with their Convoy, they were sent on a league forward of the next day's journey towards the Kings Quarters.</P>
<P>The 24 the King called a Council of War, at which he himself was present, as he always used to be; and it was there re∣solved, that after his Majesty's departure, (who intended to return and refresh him∣self a while in <HI>France</HI> after the toile he en∣dured in the <HI>Campagne</HI>) Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> should stay behind in <HI>Brabant</HI> with 20000 men, and should have for his Lieutenants general, the <HI>Sieurs de S. Abre</HI> and <HI>Foucault;</HI> for his Camp-Marshals the <HI>Sieurs de Choi∣seul, Magalotty,</HI> and <HI>de Vitry;</HI> that the Count <HI>de Chamilly</HI> should come and lye below <HI>Maestricht,</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Rochefort</HI> with the greatest part of the Kings <HI>House∣hold</HI> above it, that so betwixt them they might wholly block up that Town; that M. <HI>de la Feuillade</HI> should go with his own Bri∣gade,
<PB N="135" REF="69"/>and some others which he should have given him to the number of 4000 horse, and lye about <HI>Wezel.</HI> And because the King in∣tended to return again, as soon as he should have given such orders at home as were necessary, he sent most part of his Equi∣page and heaviest Baggage to <HI>Grave,</HI> that he might not be troubled to send them back∣wards, but that at his return he might meet them there in readiness.</P>
<P>The same day the Duke of <HI>Neubourg</HI> came to <HI>Boxtel</HI> to give his Majesty a visit, and Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI>'s <HI>Army</HI> leaving <HI>Hempel,</HI> advanc'd towards <HI>Beerlicon</HI> within 2 leagues of the Kings Quarters, and remain'd there till after his Majesty departure; whom M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> left not till then. At the same time the Spanish Troops in the Hollanders ser∣vice, having heard of the Proposals which the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Arling∣ton</HI> were going to make with Count <HI>Mon∣terey,</HI> and knowing that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was not in a condition to maintain a War of that importance as he was thrcaten'd with upon refusal, pack'd up bag and baggage, and made themselves ready to depart, upon the first orders to that purpose, which they doubted not but they should speedily receive. Some persons whom we met in our march told us they went every day to the <HI>Busse,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="70"/>and assur'd us they had seen the said Troops there, who were very weary of the service, and complain'd much of their ill diet and pay.</P>
<P>The 25, the King after having treated the Duke of <HI>Neubourg,</HI> had him out to view the Troops that belong'd to his person, and some others that were then with him, and in the evening when he came back, he let us know that he would be going the next morning for <HI>France,</HI> and accordingly gave order that all things should be in a readiness for his departure against that time.</P>
<P>The same day he committed the Govern∣ment of <HI>Lorraine</HI> to the Marquis <HI>de Roche∣fort.</HI></P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Turennes</HI> Army rested at <HI>Beerlicon,</HI> and the Count <HI>du Lude</HI> Grand-Master of the Ordnance left it, and came to <HI>Boxtel</HI> with a part of the Artillery, which was to follow the King. Some few days after, the Marquis <HI>de Ranes</HI> General of the Dragoons, and the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> Lieu∣tenant General of the Prince's Army, came thither likewise, the King having order'd them to follow him into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The 26 in the morning, the King de∣parted from <HI>Boxtel,</HI> and came to lye at <HI>Borkel,</HI> which is a great Abbey of white <HI>Fryars</HI> in the way from <HI>Boxtel</HI> to <HI>Tongres.</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="70"/>His Majesty lodg'd in the Abbey, but al∣most all the Court was forced to encamp about it, because there were very few houses thereabouts. A great part of the Regiment of <HI>Guards</HI> staid behind, to joyn with M. <HI>de Turenne</HI>'s Army, as did all the rest of the Foot which was in the Kings retinue, because they could not keep pace with the King, who intended thence forwards to take great Journeys; only 12 Companies were order'd to follow softly after him to <HI>Paris.</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> return'd to lead his Army, which lay still at <HI>Beerlicon;</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Mechlebourg</HI> came to visit the King at <HI>Bor∣kel.</HI></P>
<P>The 27 in the morning, the King left <HI>Borkel,</HI> which lies in <HI>Brabant,</HI> and within the Territories that belonged to the Hol∣lander, and having passed by <HI>Beringen,</HI> which is a little Town in <HI>Liege,</HI> went and lodg'd a league beyond that Town.</P>
<P>The 28 in the morning, the Light-horse which had hitherto accompanied the King, returned to joyn with M. <HI>de Turenne</HI>'s Army, which had not yet disencamped; his Ma∣jesty came to a little Village called <HI>Leuve,</HI> within a league of <HI>Hannuy,</HI> a little Town of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> where we met some <HI>Cravates</HI> belonging to the Spanish-Troops. The heavy baggage of the Court, and those that be∣longed
<PB N="138" REF="71"/>to them, had orders not to accom∣pany the King any farther, but to march after leisurely with a Convoy which was ordered for them all. The same kind of bag∣gage which belonged to the Kings Houshold, was sent to <HI>Maesiick</HI> with another Convoy. The King in the middle of this day's Jour∣ney met Monsieur <HI>Vaubrun</HI> with 2000 horse, a 1000 of which he left with his Majesty to guard him beyond <HI>Binche,</HI> and returned with the rest to M. <HI>de Turenne</HI>'s Army.</P>
<P>The 29 the King left <HI>Leuve</HI> betimes in the morning, and having staid to dine in the middle of his Journy, he was inform'd that all the heavy Baggages had been taken and plundered, some said by a party which sally'd out of <HI>Maestricht,</HI> and others by the <HI>Cravates</HI> we met at <HI>Hannuy.</HI> His Majesty thereupon sent in hast to know the certainty of the business, but the <HI>Courier</HI> brought back word, that only M. <HI>Brancas</HI>'s Baggage had been taken by some horse of the Enemy's who being aware that his Waggoner drove a good way before the rest, made him turn into the Woods, where they took away the horses, and left the rest to be riffled by the Peasants, who had hid and sheltered them∣selves there ever since the beginning of the War.</P>
<PB N="139" REF="71"/>
<P>The 30 the King, continuing his march, left <HI>Ameley</HI> betimes in the morning, and came by <HI>Binche,</HI> where without entring the Place he dined at the Gate, and afterwards went and lodged a league beyond that Place, up∣on the road of <HI>Quesnoy.</HI> This day he order'd the Van of his Life Guard, and the Bri∣gades of the Men at Arms and light Horse∣men to go before, and expect him at the Castle of <HI>Cambray,</HI> where he intended to spend the next day.</P>
<P>The 31, the King setting out by break of day, arriv'd at <HI>Quesnoy</HI> about 11 of the Clock, where taking only a little broth, he went to bed, and rested till 5 in the evening, and then after a light repast, took Coach, (which he had not done before during all this <HI>Campagne,</HI> but had always travail'd on horseback whatever weather it was) and rode on all night accompany'd by a strong Con∣voy, which had been drawn out of the Life Guards, Men at Arms, Light Horsemen and Musqueteers, who accompany'd him to the Castle of <HI>Cambray,</HI> where he dismissed them, and made use of those he had sent two days before to expect him there; and so march't on with them all the night following. Almost all the Court staid at <HI>Quesnoy</HI> to come lea∣surely after, because the King had horses lay'd for him by the way, and the rest of
<PB N="140" REF="72"/>the horses that came from the Army were not able to keep pace with them. The Troops that belong'd to the Kings <HI>Houshold</HI> encamp'd before the Gates of <HI>Quesnoy.</HI></P>
<P>The first of <HI>August</HI> the King arriv'd at S. <HI>Quintin</HI> by 4. of the Clock in the morning, heard <HI>Mass</HI> in the Church of S. <HI>James,</HI> and having taken a little broth, which was brought him from M. <HI>de Pradelle</HI> the Governour of that Town to a Semstresse's Shop, took Coach again and went on to <HI>Ham,</HI> where he left his Convoy, and at length arrived by 10 at night at S. <HI>Germains,</HI> where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ueen did not expect him till the Thursday following. The Troops which had staid be∣hind at <HI>Quesnoy,</HI> march'd this day to <HI>Lan∣dreby,</HI> whether the party that had convey'd the King came also, that after two or three day's rest they might return towards <HI>Mae∣stricht,</HI> whether Monsieur <HI>de Rochefort</HI> had order to march with them.</P>

<P>REaders, I grow weary of venting my Wares thus by retail. The rest are of the same kind with the former, but I will give them out to you now in the gross. They are not deceitfull I can assure you: for though I have not been an Eye∣witness to what I shall henceforward re∣late, as I was to all that pass'd during the Kings stay in Holland, yet I have it from some of my Friends who sent me their memoirs, and having no design to mis∣inform me, took care to write nothing but what they knew for certain truth. And what has confirm'd me in my good opinion of their veracity, is, that I find them alto∣gether conformable to the Accounts that were constantly brought to Court of what pass'd in our Armies. You will find here some Particulars and Circumstances, which 'tis likely you have not heard of be∣fore, and which I promise my self you will not be sorry to know. I wish I could have
<PB REF="74"/>done more both for your Service and Sa∣tisfaction, and in requital, desire you to pardon what you shall find amiss. I wil∣lingly confess my weaknes: and unfitness to be an Author. As I never valued my self upon appearing in Print, so what I have done now, was only in complaisance to some who desir'd it.</P>

<HEAD>A CONTINUATION Of what happen'd in the Dutch WAR, After the Kings return into <HI>France.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUr invincible Monarch having suffici∣ently humbled the haughty States, and left a general consternation all o∣ver their Country, which made his very name formidable to the stoutest of them, took his way for <HI>France</HI> as we before men∣tion'd.</P>
<P>His absence a little rais'd their spirits, so that they ventur'd out of their Intrench∣ments and march'd towards <HI>Woerden, Croa∣nembourg,</HI> and som other small Towns, which we had left ungarrison'd only upon pro∣mise of their Fidelity, not judging it neces∣sary to bestow Garrisons on them, that did of necessity fall into the Hands of him that was Master of the Field. They put some Forces into them, and possess'd them awhile quietly enough, and it may be we should not have concern'd our selves so far
<PB N="146" REF="75"/>as to drive them out, had not the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> design'd to make Incursions into the liberties of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> and to use <HI>Woerden</HI> as his retreat. Whereupon the Duke of <HI>Lux∣embourg,</HI> who, as we said before, command∣ed the Army near <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> and now permit∣ted it to rest and refresh it self, glad to find an opportunity of doing something for his Kings Service, took the Field, and streight march'd to <HI>Croanembourg,</HI> where (the Horse upon notice of their design, securing them∣selves by a timely retreat) they soon made themselves masters of the Foot, who with∣out much resistance, were made Prisoners of War: and not only they, but 72 more, who intrench'd themselves in a Castle that lay on the way, and for 5 or 6 hours kept our Dra∣goons in play, having killed 10 or 12, and broke Monsieur <HI>de Rouvray</HI>'s arm, who commanded our Horse and the Attaque on one side, with a Musket-shot. Afterwards the Duke march'd to <HI>Woerden,</HI> which far'd no better then <HI>Croanembourg,</HI> and the Count <HI>de la Mark</HI> was left there with the <HI>Picardy</HI> Regiment.</P>
<P>These proceedings did more trouble the States then one can well imagine: for besides the confusion it put them in, the loss of this last place, though it be little, and in it self in∣considerable, yet was of great importance
<PB N="147" REF="75"/>to them, because it gave us admission into the heart of their Country, and cut off all communication between divers of their great Towns. So they presently call'd a Council of War, and very earnestly desir'd the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> presently to besiege it, who, thinking it a business of no difficulty, the Town being but slenderly fortified, clos'd with the proposal, not doubting of car∣rying it, and reckoning it would do well to flesh his heart less Men; wherefore he pre∣sently betook himself to the march. Whe∣ther it was because the Prince had willingly, upon their req<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est, undertaken this business, or that they did imagine <HI>Woerden</HI> would not be so easily taken, I know not: but so it was, that hereupon they let not their Gal∣lant Protector depart, without bestowing on him more new Testimonies of their Kind∣ness; wherefore they drew out a very con∣siderable supply out of their Ships, with which that he might joyn, he went and en∣camped at the head of a Pass between <HI>Wesep</HI> and <HI>Naerden,</HI> where he caus'd a strong In∣trenchment to be rais'd behind a great Ca∣nale, and placed a guard on it.</P>
<P>Such preparations could not be made without the Duke of <HI>Luxemburgs</HI> know∣ledge, for every body talk'd of them; and because it seem'd probable, their designs
<PB N="148" REF="76"/>were either against <HI>Naerden,</HI> which they had long threatned, or <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> towards which their march seem'd to incline, he presently drew out to prevent them.</P>
<P>This happened on the 8<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> for though they had long known of the Kings return into <HI>France,</HI> yet were they 2 or 3 months before they could so recollect their spirits as to think upon attempting any thing. The Duke therefore by 4 in the morning, leading with him 4000 Foot, and all his Horse, went and took up his post near the Pass through which the whole Dutch Army was to march; but this he did so suddenly, that he surprized them; so that their Van-guard, without staying to discover who we were, betook themselves to their heels with as much hast as if they had been already beaten, which gave our Van-guard occasion to laugh at them sufficiently: yet with all their haste they could not escape some of our Dragoons, who flung them∣selves into the Cannel, which serv'd them as a Baricado, and swimming over killed di∣vers of them, and took 40 Prisoners just be∣fore the Intrenchment within which the whole Body of their Army lay, not one of them daring to stir out to bring off their Companions; only they let fly some Vol∣leys of Shot from their Canon, notwith∣standing
<PB N="149" REF="76"/>which, our Men encamped them∣selves there.</P>
<P>The next day being the ninth, our Army, which had purposely taken this post to ob∣serve their motions, was very intent all day upon that, and getting together some For∣rage, without enterprising any thing else: But the Hollanders lay not so quiet as we, for they had been too long upon the defen∣sive part already, and therefore resolv'd now to enter upon the offensive; 20 or 30 of their bravest Fellows seeing us lie still, had a great mind to take our Forragers, who were as securely at their work, as if they had been at the Gates of <HI>Paris,</HI> not thinking any body would dare to come and disturb them. This their confidence gave the Enemy the better opportunity, who thereupon enclosed both the Men, Horses and Forrage. The truth is, the Sieur <HI>de la Rouillardiere,</HI> Captain of a Company of Dra∣goons, and the Sieur <HI>Vieuxpont</HI> his Cornet, had been order'd to be their Convoy; but because the extent of the Country, which they were to defend, was somewhat large, they had divided themselves, each taking 15 <HI>Maistres</HI> which they commanded; so that they could not hinder the Enemies design, neither did they oppose it, but suffer'd all to be taken. Yet the Hollander had no rea∣son
<PB N="148" REF="77"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="149" REF="77"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="130" REF="78"/>to brag of the Exploit; for our Captain and his Cornet, instead of coming towards them, left them masters of the Field awhile, and wheeling a little about, joyn'd, and took up their post in a narrow passage, by which they saw the Enemy must come with his prize, and there waited for them; where, after having stood their first discharge, they made them all Prisoners, not one escaping, and brought them, and all the Forragers, back to our Camp. In the Evening, the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> gave order to his Men to be ready by the next Morning, resolving, seeing they stirr'd not, to approach them nearer, and try if he could entice them out: and at the same time order'd a Ca∣ptain of the <HI>Piedmont</HI> Regiment, with 12 Granadiers, to go and attaque them within their Barricado, and try if any of them sal∣lyed out, to take some Prisoners, whilst he would be ready, in case of need, to bring them off. The Captain perform'd what he was commanded very couragiously, past their first Barricado without any resistance, and march'd on to the second, where he found as little opposition; and seeing nothing but Men that fled, he advanc'd to the third, which chanc'd to be a House, so he set fire on that, and went on with intent to take some Pri∣soners if he could, as he had been ordered,
<PB N="141" REF="78"/>but he lost his labor; for the Dutchmen, notwithstanding their pursie fat bulk, plyed their legs so nimbly at this time, that it was not possible for him to overtake one. Where∣fore he return'd, and being to give account of what he had done, told the Duke, He had forc'd &amp; fired their Barricado's, and ran after the Enemy, but without being able to catch any, because they flew, fear having put wings to their feet. The truth is, they never left running till they came to <HI>Boden∣grave,</HI> so that M. <HI>de Luxembourg</HI> finding there was likely to be no more action, re∣turn'd to <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> where he was not long idle; for the Hollanders prepared more Lau∣rels for him, as you shall hear.</P>
<P>The tenth in the Morning they set forward, and embarking upon the River to the num∣ber of 14000, came and took up their post before <HI>Woerden,</HI> which the Prince caus'd presently to be block'd up, hoping to sur∣prise the Garrison, who indeed had no no∣tice of their coming; but they not having been negligent in their duties, the business was not likely to be effected so soon as the Enemy hop'd, who now began to fear this little paltry Town would cost them more then they imagined, wherefore they spent the rest of this, and all the following day, in Intrenching themselves, and fortifying all
<PB N="152" REF="79"/>the Avenues to their Camp, especially that part of it which lay towards <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> ima∣gining if any succors came to the Town, it it would be from thence. In the mean time, the Count <HI>de la Mark</HI> took care to give no∣tice to the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> and not doubting but he would speedily come to his assistance, was still upon the watch, ready to sally forth and set upon the Enemy on his side, as soon as he should find some succors come to second him.</P>
<P>Upon this Intelligence, which came in a very ill time (because the Duke of <HI>Luxem∣bourg</HI> was then in the Field with so small a party as could not be able to attempt any thing of themselves, any one but he would have been sufficiently puzled; but it was not then a time to stand considering, where∣fore he commanded those that were with him to march on toward the besieged place, whilst he went post to <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> where he or∣dered the Marquis of <HI>Genlis</HI> to take all the Horse he had, and some Foot, and follow after with all possible speed, ordering 2000 which were then ready to march immedi∣atly, because the danger being great requir'd a like remedy. These Orders were given most prudently, and if they were not ac∣cordingly executed, I can give no reason for it; but this I can certainly affirm, That the
<PB N="253" REF="79"/>Duke, being impatient till he got to the E∣nemy, left all these Forces to be brought af∣ter by Monsieur <HI>de Genlis,</HI> and put himself at the head of those he had sent before, when he first receiv'd the news of the Siege; and the other 2000 Foot which he found ready, resolving with this small party to set upon the Enemy, and venture all, rather then suf∣fer the place to be lost so under his nose, with∣out ever attempting any thing to save it.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledg'd that this Enter∣prize was strangely hazardous, and the happy issue of it beyond belief. For it seem'd morally impossible, that our party should swim over a River, and the Causeys being as good for the Hollander as so many Rampires and Gabions; that they should rout an Army ten times as numerous as their own, and win a Fort from them furnished with five Intrenchments well flank'd and pallizado'd. Yet notwithstanding all this, the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> having staid a little for Monsieur <HI>de Genlis,</HI> and as long as was convenient to prepare himself for an attaque, began to set on the Enemy, who in spite of all his courage, and theirs that he command∣ed, beat him twice back; but at the third Onset, the Marquis <HI>de Meilly</HI> gave the rest a good example, by leaping into the Water up to his middle, which made many Offi∣cers
<PB N="140" REF="80"/>and Voluntiers, and at last the whole party to do the like, and so they passed over upon the very mouthes of the Enemies Guns, and got within their Intrenchments, which they were glad to quit and betake themselves to slight, as their last and best re∣fuge.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de la Mark</HI> in the mean while, who as I said before, was still ready to re∣ceive the Enemy if he had assaulted the place, or to sally out, if he saw any likeli∣hood of being assisted, being aware of the Duke of <HI>Luxembourgs</HI> arrival and attaque, lost no time, but sallyed out in person, and fell in amongst them like Lightning, killing many with his own hand, and being very well seconded by those that followed him, who had before tryed the Enemies Courage in a Sally that 400 of them made at the be∣ginning of the Siege, in which, driving the Enemy out of a part of the Suburbs where they had sheltred themselves, the better to make their approaches, they fired it, and beat the Enemy out of three Intrenchments which they had made to hinder any sallies from the Town. The M. of <HI>Bois Dauphin</HI> was killed in this first action, with six other Soldiers. So all their Intrench∣ments, Banks, Canales, Sluces, Forts and
<PB N="145" REF="80"/>Redouts, wherewith they had fortified them∣selves, and all their Canon, were obstacles too weak to keep us out, for they were pre∣sently quite routed, and the Prince of <HI>O∣range</HI> himself was forc'd to put all hopes of safety in the fleetness of his Horse. But he was fortunate enough, not to be of the number of about 500 who were taken, and 800 slain; amongst which were the Sieur <HI>Zulestein,</HI> who had been Tutor to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Bis</HI> his Steward; with 2 other Colonels, 3 Lieutenants, and about 70 or 80 Officers, besides a great many that were drown'd, and whose num∣ber could not be certainly known, but may be guest at by those who were since taken up at divers places; which among the rest, amounted to 50 in one little Canale.</P>
<P>Their flight was too sudden for them to think of any thing but saving their lives, wherefore all their Baggage and Canon, which were nine Pieces, three of which were on Batteries against the Town, and the rest within their Intrenchments, against any succor that might come to relieve it, fell in∣to our hands. These were all put into the Town, and will be made use of to repulse the Enemy again, if they dare ever attempt any thing against it.</P>
<PB N="156" REF="81"/>
<P>As there are no Roses without Prickles, nor great Pleasures, which have not either accompanying or soon following them some alloy of sorrow, so this strangely fortunate success, could not be attain'd without some loss of our side. We lost in the Action ma∣ny Soldiers, and among the Persons of Note were the Count <HI>de Meilly,</HI> the Colonel to the <HI>Normandy</HI> Regiment, and who commanded the Foot in this Service, the Sieur <HI>de la Til∣hays</HI> his Lieutenant, a Gentleman of <HI>Nor∣mandy,</HI> and the Sieur <HI>de Parville Tibout,</HI> a Voluntier of <HI>Normandy</HI> likewise, in the same Body. The M. <HI>de la Meylleraye,</HI> Co∣lonel of the <HI>Piedmont</HI> Regiment. M. <HI>de Lar∣diniere,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the <HI>Navarre</HI> Regiment, and the Chevalier <HI>de Boufflers,</HI> Colonel of the Regiment <HI>Royal</HI> of Dragoons were dangerously wounded; besides divers Voluntiers who did wonders.</P>
<P>As the success of so perillous an Enter∣prise could not but be very glorious to the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> so upon that account it did reward it self; but neither prov'd it less advantagious to him, then glorious. For the generous Monarch, for whose service it had been undertook, no sooner heard of it, but with many Commendations bestow'd on him, He presently thought how he might re∣compense it; and besides a great sum of
<PB N="157" REF="81"/>mony, sent the Duke a Commission to be Captain of his Guards, in the stead of the Marquis <HI>de Lauzun Peguilain,</HI> that he and all Men might thereby see, That no Man serves him for nothing, That whatever is done for him, is presently follow'd by its re∣compence; and, That he better knows how to reward Virtue then punish Vice.</P>
<P>This first Essay of the Hollanders, for the execution of which they had taken all possi∣ble care, and done all that might assure them of a good event, succeeding so ill, was not however altogether useless to the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> who being made more cautious by his ill success, resolv'd from henceforward not to venture any thing, nor make the least attempt where he was sure to find any great opposition. The States likewise began to discover how unseasonably they had put him upon this Siege. Wherefore, that he might not be forc'd to be always doing nothing, to which he was here reduc'd by the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> who was still at the heels of him, as soon as he took the Field. He thought he might do somthing to more purpose, if leaving Holland he went toward <HI>Liege,</HI> ei∣ther against <HI>Tongres</HI> or <HI>Fouquemont,</HI> which were neither fortified, nor like to be succor'd by any Army that lay near them: for M. <HI>de Turenne</HI> was march'd after the Imperial and
<PB N="148" REF="82"/><HI>Brandenbourg</HI> Forces, or else against <HI>Maesiick,</HI> whose Fortifications not being yet finish'd, would more easily be taken. In this reso∣lution he chose out his best Troops, and most experienc'd Commanders, in whom he chief∣ly confided, and made up a Body of about 14000 or 15000 Men. And thus having given all necessary Orders for the security of his Camp at <HI>Bodengrave,</HI> (which had hither∣to been his retiring place in all his Misfor∣tunes, and which having been fortifying it all the Summer, he had made a Bulwark for the security of all the rest of <HI>Holland</HI>) he set forward by the ways of <HI>Worcum, Gorcum,</HI> and <HI>Breda,</HI> designing to take with him a part of the Garrison of this last nam'd Town, as well as those of the <HI>Busse, Berguen-op-Zoom,</HI> and <HI>Maestricht,</HI> to augment his Army; but did not execute what he intended, either be∣cause he chang'd his mind, or because he could not, the Garrisons of those places being for the most part Spaniards. How∣ever it were, it matters not, but <HI>Bommelle</HI> lying in his way, and that being a great rich Town, and one of the chief of those that lie on the <HI>Wahal,</HI> he thought it would be no bad prize if he could compass it, and would be a happy beginning of his intended Pro∣gress; wherefore he march'd thither, and began to make his approaches; but going
<PB N="141" REF="82"/>in Person to view it, he chanc'd to bleed at the Nose; which seeming ominous, he would not obstinatly stay any longer before it, but march'd straight on to <HI>Tongres,</HI> with design to set upon that. But the Sieur <HI>Montal,</HI> Go∣vernor of <HI>Charleroy,</HI> having had Orders from the King, who had intelligence of their de∣sign, to put some Soldiers into it; having done accordingly, spoil'd their design. <HI>Mae∣siick</HI> would have been a better bit for them, but they were too dainty to stoop to such course fair, and therefore went on towards <HI>Fouquemont,</HI> upon which the Prince vented all his fury, and took it with as much greedi∣ness, as it had been defended generously, by the Lieutenant Colonel of the <HI>Jonzac.</HI> Regi∣ment, who was in it only with 200 Men, endur'd four Assaults very bravely, but at last was forc'd to yield it up. After this, the Prince resum'd his design against <HI>Ton∣gres,</HI> and march'd towards it; but let us leave him awhile to see what was done in the mean time in his own Country.</P>
<P>The Hollander had not so much reason to rejoyce at the taking of <HI>Fouquemont,</HI> as they had of being sorrowful at the success of our Arms, and those of the Bishop of <HI>Munsters</HI> in <HI>Friseland.</HI> The Count <HI>de Saulx,</HI> having been told by a certain Captain in his Regi∣ment, who had learn'd it from some German
<PB N="148" REF="83"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="141" REF="83"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="160" REF="84"/>Fugitives from the Dutch Army, that the <HI>Bampfield</HI> Regiment lay at <HI>Hylestein</HI> in very ill plight, and that there was a way to come to them which was not well guarded, and whose Fortifications were not capable of gi∣ving us any stop, the Guard it self consist∣ing but of 40 or 50 Men, which lay a great way from the rest within an Intrenchment beyond the Canale of <HI>Gorcum;</HI> and that their retreat might be cut off, not to lose any time, sent some to take knowledge of the Post, and in the mean time gave intelligence of it to the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> who was very glad of the news, but however expected the return of those who were gon to take an ac∣count of the place; who soon returning, con∣firm'd almost all that the German Fugitives had related. Hereupon the Count <HI>de Saulx</HI> received the Order which he had desir'd of marching thither; he had given him to that end 300 Men of his own Regiment, and 200 out of that of <HI>Castelnau,</HI> 50 Dragoons, and as many Horse, with Commission only to take all the party that were guarding that passage, and not to venture, for fear of be∣ing lost in going to the Enemies Quarters.</P>
<P>The 15 of <HI>November</HI> was the day which confer'd on him the glory he gain'd in this enterprize. He set out about 3 of the clock after dinner, having at least 100 Refor∣mades
<PB N="161" REF="84"/>Officers that follow'd him as Vo∣luntiers; and the first thing he did, was to send a Captain of his Regiment to go be∣fore and secure the Avenues, that no intelli∣gence might be given to the Enemy of the march. But he was but just got beyond a place called <HI>Lexmende</HI> when he saw the Ca∣ptain return, who brought word, That the Enemy had certainly smelt the Design, be∣ing since they were sent, the number of the party was encreas'd, and they had made up a Barriere before their Intrenchment, where they had plac'd some of their new comers, whom he had seen reliev'd by others, and that the outward Guard seem'd to consist of about 10 Men.</P>
<P>This news encreas'd the joy of our brave Commander, who now saw, that though he was confin'd to do nothing but carry away all that guarded that place, yet he now should carry away at least twice as many; and that if he afterwards march'd on to the Enemies Quarters (as he intended) he should with more ease master them, since they had weak∣ned themselves by sending this party to the others assistance. Wherefore he command∣ed the same Captain, with his Company, to take only their Swords and leave their Fire∣arms behind, that so they might, if possible, make the other party yield without noise,
<PB N="162" REF="85"/>least the Alarm should be thereby given to the Enemies main Quarters. This was ve∣ry well contriv'd, but the party proving to be Horse (which he knew not of his Scouts, who saw none of their Horses) some of them gave notice to the rest time enough for them (who had receiv'd very considerable succors upon the intelligence they receiv'd 2 hours before of the Design) to prepare themselves to receive us.</P>
<P>So great an alteration was enough to have sent the Count back as he came, but it did only heighten his courage, who thought himself now too far ingag'd to leave off so, wherefore seeing all his men desiring nothing more then to engage, he continued his march, and within a little while came with∣in Pistol-shot of the Intrenchment. There were two ways which led to it, and gave him an opportunity to attaque it in two pla∣ces at once, but one of them was hardly passable upon the account of a Sluce five or six foot deep; yet notwithstanding he re∣solv'd to make use of them both, and to that purpose mended the other a little first, and then immediatly commanded the Grenadi∣ers to advance and cut down the Pallisados; but they not being able to perform it, because of their thickness, he commanded the Offi∣cers to climb over, which succeeded so well,
<PB N="163" REF="85"/>that the Enemies, after a short resistance, be∣took themselves to flight, and gain'd their Quarters where they staid not long; for see∣ing themselves pursued, they stole away without any noise of Drum or Trumpet, though they were 1000 or 1200 Men.</P>
<P>It must be confess'd, that as the Enemies were always very vigorously set upon, so was their Cowardize extraordinary, other∣wise it had not been possible 1200 Men should suffer themselves to be routed and beaten out of a Fort, which on one side was strengthned by a great Canale that ran at the foot of it, and on the other by two rows of strong Pallisado's 7 Foot high, a Pa∣rapet Canon proof, 8 foot high, with two pieces of Ordnance, which they had plac'd there upon notice of our Design; besides 3 Fregats upon the Canale, who with their Ca∣non were to defend the Intrenchment.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Castlenaw,</HI> who was one of the Voluntiers, after having kill'd three with his own hand, in the heat of the Action had his hand lifted up to have done as much to a fourth, but was prevented by a Musket∣shot, which so shatter'd his Arm, that it was fain to be cut off; and afterwards, notwith∣standing all the Chirurgions care, gangrend, so that he dyed of it some days after at <HI>Ʋ∣trecht,</HI> and was much lamented by all, as one
<PB N="164" REF="86"/>of the most couragious and brave Men we had: but his death was soon reveng'd by that of him that had shot him, and 50 of his Companions, which were killed on the place, and 100 more who were taken: the Fire destroying the rest of them.</P>
<P>The same day being the 15<SUP>th</SUP>, the Marquis <HI>de Moussis,</HI> Colonel of the <HI>Queens</HI> Regiment, having been order'd to go and beat up a par∣ty of the Enemy Quarter'd near <HI>Wesep,</HI> went accordingly with 300 Men, drawn out of the Garrison of <HI>Naerden;</HI> but he found no body, for they had retir'd upon notice of his march, so they fired the Village which they had quitted.</P>
<P>At the same time the Enemy took a fansie to attaque a place in <HI>Frizeland,</HI> whether they went with 5000 Horse and 300 Foot, and not having been able to surprize it as they hop'd, they laid so formal a Siege to it, that it lasted too long to their misfortune. For the Marquis <HI>Reinel,</HI> Camp-master to a party of Horse of the Confederate Forces, hear∣ing of it, got together all the Men he could in hast, and went to its relief, where he broke through their Lines, getting into the Camp among them, killed many, routed the rest, and gain'd all their baggage.</P>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> their Pro∣tector, had no better fortune then they, or
<PB N="165" REF="86"/>the Imperialists that he had with him.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Sainfandaux</HI> at this time Fora∣ging about the Country with 20 or 25 <HI>Mai∣stres,</HI> was betraid by a Peasant who was his Guide, into the Hands of a party of theirs, consisting of 800, where after a long and brave resistance, he was at length over∣power'd by numbers, wounded, and carry∣ed away Prisoner. This was done before any Declaration of War from that Elector, but this act of Hostility was not long with∣out Reprizals. Monsieur <HI>Turenne</HI> hearing they had left 100 Horse for the Guard of the Bridge, by which they had pass'd over the <HI>Main,</HI> sent 150 <HI>Maistres</HI> of the Kings hous∣hold, under the command of Monsieur <HI>Brizac,</HI> Lieutenant of the Life-guards, to take cognizance of them, and discover whi∣ther what had been done was out of some particular grudge to M. <HI>Saintsandoux,</HI> or that they intended an open War. He went ac∣cordingly, and having found the Bridge guarded as he had been informed, advanc'd towards the Commander in chief, and after having ask'd who they were for, demanded free passage, which was granted him: after∣wards he demanded Quarters in the neigh∣boring Houses, whereupon the Officer told him, That being there was not suf∣ficient room to quarter both parties in,
<PB N="166" REF="87"/>there was no reason he who had first taken up the Quarters should be turn'd out of them; this satisfied him as to that point, he having no design to quarter there, wherefore M. <HI>Brizac</HI> ask'd him if he would send for some Wine, saying, They must needs drink a Bottle together: but the German smelling a design of making him speak more in his drink then he was minded to do now he was sober, replyed, He had already drunk his Mornings draught; and that if they must needs drink to one another, it must be at a distance: whereupon Monsieur <HI>de Brizac</HI> commanded his Men to advance, saying, Why then you are not our Friends? and so sell on and defeated them. A part of whom were kill'd in the Encounter, and the rest were either taken, or saved themselves by flight, so that our Men became masters of the Bridge; but Monsieur <HI>Brizac</HI> having had no order to keep it, came back with his party.</P>
<P>The keeping of this Bridge was of main consequence to the Duke of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> both upon the account of his Interest and Ho∣nor: it being the way by which he was to retire, in case of ill success; and he having bragg'd and promis'd he would maintain it. Wherefore, having been told by those who had fled, that they had been defeated by one
<PB N="167" REF="87"/>only Squadron, imagining we should have kept the same post, he sent 2000 Men to take it from us; but we saved them a labor, because we thought it not worth keeping. But it seems they were not of our mind, for those 2000 Men strongly entrenched themselves at the end of the Bridge, and set∣ing a strong guard there, dispos'd of them∣selves as well as they could in the Quarters thereabout, but with order to be ever upon their guard, because they foresaw that as long as Monsieur <HI>Turenne</HI> lay so near them, he would not fail frequently to visit them.</P>
<P>They were not out in their conjectures, for Monsieur <HI>Turenne</HI> having had notice of their being his neighbors, two days after their return thither, and imagining they were come thither with a design not to for∣sake the place without engaging, took with him the Kings Houshold, and march'd to∣wards them with all speed, to take cogni∣zance of them himself, being resolv'd once more to beat them from that post.</P>
<P>He had not march'd far, when being yet above three quarters of a mile short of the Bridge, passing thorow a Wood he met the Count <HI>d'Onak,</HI> a near Kinsman to the Duke of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> who being out upon a de∣sign of getting intelligence, hearing some Dogs which had follow'd our party, and
<PB N="168" REF="88"/>were hunting in the Wood, he follow'd the Cry till he came near our Van-guard, and hearing a noise of Men and Horses, came on towards us, but found other kind of Hunters then he was aware of, for he soon perceived they were our Troops by their marching in rank and file; he came up to us notwithstanding very resolutly, and having ask'd who we were for, let fly at us first; who returning the same salute, wounded him in five or six places, whereof he dyed on the place cursing and swearing: part of his followers, which were 15 or 16 in all, were taken Prisoners, and the rest fled to the Bridge, where they put the whole party in such a fright, that M. <HI>Turenne</HI> at his arri∣val found it deserted.</P>
<P>These were the worthy Exploits the Hol∣lander and their Partizans perform'd at home, whilst the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> rang'd a∣bout in the Country of <HI>Liege,</HI> with intent to surprize some place on that side. He went to set upon <HI>Liege</HI> it self, but staid not long before it: but because <HI>Tongres,</HI> and the Gar∣rison there had done him much mischief, he had a great spight at it, and was alway fra∣ming some design against it. After the ta∣king of <HI>Fouquemont,</HI> he resolv'd to besiege it in good earnest; and it was in his march to∣wards it that we left him but now, and there∣fore
<PB N="169" REF="88"/>we will now pursue our discourse of him, and see how his design sped. But if we would have found him before the Place, we must have return'd sooner, for though he came thither with intent to sit down before it, yet Count <HI>Marsin</HI> made the pro∣ject miscarry, who (seing though the Place was not over well fortified, yet the Garrison in it was very strong, and might defend themselves very long, and cost a great many lives to winn it, M. <HI>de Montal</HI> being in the Place, who doubtless would maintain it to the last), advised him not to pursue the de∣sign any farther.</P>
<P>This advice which was well grounded, suggested to them another more likely pro∣ject, and the issue of which would be of much more consequence. Monsieur <HI>Montal</HI> being now in <HI>Tongres,</HI> whether he was come and had brought with him a great party of men to reinforce the Garrison, made them judge <HI>Charleroy,</HI> whose Governour he was, and out of which he had drawn those men, might easily be gained, both upon the ac∣count of the Governours absence, and thin∣ness of the Garrison, which they imagin'd was much weakened by the party that M. <HI>de Montal</HI> had thence carried with him to <HI>Tongres:</HI> upon these grounds, they resolv'd to besiege it, and gave Count <HI>Monterey</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="89"/>notice of their design, to oblige him consi∣dering the importance of the Place, to send them more Forces; which, it seems, he too carefully and zealously did. For he unfurnish∣ed many of his Towns to make up a body of 16000, which was directly contrary to the Treaty at the <HI>Pyrenaeans</HI> and <HI>Aix la Chappelle.</HI></P>
<P>The 15 of <HI>December</HI> the Count <HI>Marsin,</HI> who commanded that Body, went and sat down before the Place in expectation of the Prince who was to follow with his Army.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Sieur <HI>de Montal</HI> being inform'd of the design by some pri∣soners, and by 50 <HI>Maistres,</HI> whom he had ordered to follow the Enemy at a distance and observe their motions, (though he could hardly beleive they would venture upon so great and difficult a business) yet sent intel∣ligence of it to the Court (as they also did from <HI>Charleroy</HI>) withal desiring a Commis∣sion to return, and get into the Town; which he immediatly prepared himself to do, without staying for orders, so soon as he should be sure they were resolved upon the Siege of that Place.</P>
<P>The 16 Monsieur de <HI>S. Cla</HI> a Brigadier of Horse, hearing of the same design at <HI>Maesiick</HI> where he then was, went thence accompanied by the <HI>Sieurs de S. Sylvestre,</HI> and <HI>d'Arty</HI> Captains of Horse, the <HI>Sieurs
<PB N="171" REF="89"/>de Labadie, Vignart, de Treüil</HI> Lieutenants <HI>Levigny</HI> and <HI>Magny</HI> Cornets, and <HI>Lopair</HI> and <HI>Empereur</HI> Quarter-Masters, together with 50 other Horse, and brought the con∣firmation of this news to M. <HI>de Montal</HI> at <HI>Tongres,</HI> offering him withal, to accompany him in his design of getting back into the Town; he accepted their profer, and with∣out any farther delay, dispos'd himself to set forward the next morning.</P>
<P>The 17 he set out about 10 in the morn∣ing, as he had appointed, accompanied by the forementioned Gentlemen and their 50 <HI>Maistres,</HI> besides 60 more which he had brought along with him to <HI>Tongres,</HI> and marched all day and all night, intending to get thither the next day, whatever it cost them. In the mean time, the <HI>Couriers,</HI> who had been sent with the news, making all possible speed, arriv'd all three one after another to <HI>Versailles,</HI> were their Majesties then were.</P>
<P>The news they brought, was so extra∣ordinary, and it seem'd so improbable that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> should come into <HI>Fland∣ers</HI> to besiege one of our principal Places there, that had not all the 3 Couriers suc∣cessively confirmed what had been related, of the Count <HI>Monterey</HI>'s drawing out 15000 or 1600 men out of his Garrisons, and
<PB N="172" REF="90"/>sending them to begin the Siege, the <HI>Couriers</HI> would have been laught at as mad men, rather then beleiv'd; besides that after all, there was another reason that added to the improbability of it, which was the viola∣tion of the Treaty, which after this Count <HI>Monterey</HI> could not excuse. They were not∣withstanding beleived, because they all said the same thing, and the King thereupon that same night sent the Marquis of <HI>Louvois</HI> thi∣ther in post, and sent orders to the Marshal <HI>d'Humieres,</HI> who was at his own estate near <HI>Compiegne</HI> to go immediatly to <HI>Lisle,</HI> of which he was Governour, and there to expect farther orders. As M. <HI>de Louvoys</HI> is a man of excellent conduct and foresight in mana∣ging business, so is he indefatigable when their is need of dispatch, he therefore set out at midnight as soon as he had his orders, and having sent to the Chevalier <HI>de Nogent</HI> to accompany him, went by <HI>Peronne,</HI> and thence to <HI>Athe.</HI> The Marshal <HI>d'Humieres</HI> likewise though he had kept his bed three days before, being tormented by the Colick, set out immediatly for <HI>Lisle.</HI> As to Monsieur <HI>de Montal,</HI> he took the same way along the Caussey, by which the Enemy had march'd before him, that so he might not be disco∣vered: he had not marched above 5 or 6 hours, before he overtook some of the rear
<PB N="173" REF="90"/>of their Army loitering behind, all which he strip'd and hamme-string'd their horses, that they might not follow nor give notice of his march.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8 before day he came pretty near the Enemy, 1500 or 1600 of whose foot were quartered in a Village call'd <HI>Perruis,</HI> and all the horse who conveyed them were disposed of in other Villages along the Caus∣sey, as far as <HI>Giblow;</HI> all these he passed without being discovered, but coming nearer <HI>Charleroy,</HI> was aware of other Troops, whom to avoid he was forced to turn out of his way, and fetch a compass on the right hand to gain the Woods.</P>
<P>All this was don in the night, and at day break he arrived within sight of their Camp, but there made a halt, not being willing to appear till their guards were releiv'd, least when he would have forced his passage, all the whole Army should be upon his back, which succeeded as he could have wish'd.</P>
<P>The first body of Men he came at, after coming out of the Woods, was a Regiment of Spanish foot, amongst whom he intruded so far, before they were aware of it, that though they began to suspect him, yet they dared not give the Alarm, but on the con∣trary saluted him civilly, and he returned them the like.</P>
<PB N="174" REF="91"/>
<P>If Monsieur <HI>de Montal</HI> had found all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> of the same oblig∣ing and civil temper, he would certainly have ever after commended their good breeding, and found no use for the swords which he and all his party carried ready drawn under their cloakes. But that would not be, for as he came near a Glass-house where a great many were quartered, as well as in all the out-houses thereabouts, some body having spied their naked swords, cryed to Arms, saying they were Enemies, and thereupon they shot at them from every part, because they still marched on, not minding what was don; but by this time the Alarm was every where spread, and it was time for our men to think of defending them∣selves, which they did so much the more easily because the Enemies Horse-guard, which consisted of 150 <HI>Maistres,</HI> and were posted between the Town and Camp had newly unbridled their horses, so that not above 70 or 80 were found ready, who came upon us and were most of them killed, a∣mongst whom was he that lead them call'd <HI>Floris Major,</HI> who was in great repute a∣mongst them. 13 or 14 of our party were either killed or taken, whom we staid not to releive, least by so doing we should have lost the favorable opportunity of getting in∣to
<PB N="175" REF="91"/><HI>Charleroy,</HI> for if we had obstinatly staid to disengage them, it may be the whole Army had fall'n upon us. We therefore pre∣sently gain'd the Town, in number 100 horse, besides the Officers, and got into it on <HI>Brus∣sels</HI> side, where at our coming M. <HI>de Montal</HI> found every one doing their duty, and very watchful against any thing the Enemy should attempt.</P>
<P>The Place was close beset by the Enemy, who lay within Carrabine shot of it, yet without attemting any thing upon the out∣works: The truth is M. <HI>de Franclieu,</HI> the Kings Lieutenant in that Place, who com∣manded in cheif during the Governors ab∣sence, had done every thing that was pos∣sible, and applied all imaginable diligence, to put all things in the best posture that could be, in case they should be attaqu'd. Monsieur <HI>Desbonnais,</HI> a Brigadier of foot, who by good chance had staid there, did likewise much contribute to it, as did the <HI>Sieur Terrade,</HI> an Engineer, who took on him the care of the works: so that every body strove who should shew most zeal for his Majesty's and their Country's service, there being no body who deserv'd not much commendation on this occasion.</P>
<P>As soon as Monsieur <HI>de Montal</HI> was ar∣rived he took care that all things should be
<PB N="176" REF="92"/>ordered to the best advantage, and finding that the party of horse which he had brought with him, might be very serviceable to him against the Enemy, and likewise very trouble∣some to the Place if their Forrage began to fail, he sent out 50 of them to defend 150 Musketeers, commanded by the <HI>Sieur Des∣bonnais,</HI> whilst they should get together all the Forrage they could find all along the <HI>Sambre,</HI> in the most remote houses, this was 3 houres doing, and had been sooner perform'd had not the Enemy strove to oppose it, and so hinder'd our men from returning so soon as otherwise they might. And yet we lost nothing by the bargain, for our men beat the Enemy on this occasion from a Post which they kept with a considerable guard of horse and foot, and killed many of them, we loosing but 2 Soldiers in all the Action.</P>
<P>Whilst all this went on so gloriously, e∣very body was severaly employed in the Town, M. <HI>de Montal</HI> betook himself to dis∣cover the designs of the Enemy, and having observed a Battery which they were raising upon a rising ground that lay before the two little ponds, where the works chanced no to be coated, nor quite finish'd; he judg'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they would make their cheif attaque on that side, which made him particularly provid for the security of that quarter, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="177" REF="92"/>might defend it to the last. Now Monsieur <HI>de Franclieu,</HI> having before foreseen how the business would go, had drawn a traverse acrosse the whole length, which though it was not yet quite perfected, yet was forward enough, to be capable of sheltering those Soldiers, which M. <HI>de Montal</HI> immediately commanded to be placed there, together with some horse which were ordered to take up their station in the ditch, which was not fenc'd with Pallisados, that they might have the freer passage in and out. The <HI>Sieurs de Franclieu</HI> and <HI>Desbonnais</HI> placed themselves where they thought they might do the best service in their own persons.</P>
<P>But the Enemy, who by this time disco∣vered from their Camp, which lay very near, that they should not easily carry the Place, began to flinch, and abate much of their fury; so that the night following, instead of assaulting the Town, as they ought to have done, they discontinued their Battery, so that on the 19 in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he morning Monsieur <HI>de Montal</HI> observing this, resolved to send out all his Horse, with orders to sally out upon the high ground that lay towards <HI>Brussels,</HI> and to line the Counterscarpe, and out∣works with all his Musqueteers, that so they might get some prisoners. This suc∣ceeded
<PB N="178" REF="93"/>according to his wish, and indeed all was ordered with admirable courage and conduct. Twenty Horse were first sent out, who falling in with the Enemies out∣guard, entic'd out their main Guard con∣sisting of 150 Horse, commanded by the Baron of <HI>S. John,</HI> with three Colours; but Monsieur <HI>de S. Cla,</HI> who was ready with all the rest of the Horse upon the first onset to follow and second them, came just in time to fall on those who came in a greater number to releive the Enemy; he utterly routed them, killing many, among which was the <HI>Sieur de S. Jean,</HI> who re∣ceived two mortal wounds: there was a Lieutenant, and some others taken pri∣soners, and carried into the Town, whilst the rest of our men retreated leasurely to∣wards the Counterscarp, on purpose to draw on the Enemies that way who pursued but faintly, but were set forwards by the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Lou∣vignies,</HI> who hearing the Alarm which had by this time been spread over their whole Camp, were come to their relief, with many others of the most considerable per∣sons in their Army.</P>
<P>They came near enough to receive a sa∣lute of small shot from a small party of
<PB N="179" REF="93"/>our foot, which hurt many of them, and a discharge from our Canon, which plaid so well that many of them were cut off by it, and among others 3 Cornets, one of which belonged to the Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> Guards; the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont</HI> lost his horse and his heel, which had like to cost him his life; and they were all so roughly handled, that they afterward kept at a great∣er distance, and not dared to make any ap∣proach, though we did all we could to in∣vite them to it, but on the contrary they placed a party of foot behind their Horse∣guard, to second them, in case we should sally out again.</P>
<P>All this while our indefatigable King, whom neither the time of the year, nor the ill weather, nor any other difficulty could ever fright, being accustomed to expose himself to as many dangers as if he were a private person, resolved to go himself to provide for the defence of the Place, and the Queen being sensible how impatient she should be of his absence, if she could not constantly hear from him, resolved to go as far as <HI>Compiegne,</HI> that she might be nearer him; so their Majesties the same day left <HI>Versailles,</HI> and went to <HI>S. Germain</HI> in <HI>Laye.</HI></P>
<PB N="180" REF="94"/>
<P>The 20 was spent at the same place in giving order for their Majesty's progress. The Enemy before <HI>Charleroy,</HI> whether it were because they began to be sensible that they should loose their labour. if they staid any longer, or that they apprehended some design against them from Monsieur <HI>Lou∣vois,</HI> who was at <HI>Athe,</HI> giving orders for every thing that might any way inconve∣nience them, or from the Marshal <HI>d'Hu∣mieres,</HI> who was there likewise, and had by this time gathered together a body of 15000 or 16000 men, or that they had intelligence of the Duke <HI>de Duras</HI> his march∣ing with all speed towards them; what∣ever it was I can't determine, but they be∣gan to prepare for a retreat, and without offering to stir a foot forward, whatever sallies we made upon them, were content to stand on their own defence.</P>
<P>All this while Monsieur <HI>de Montal</HI> not knowing of their design, and understand∣ing they had ready great numbers of Fag∣gots and wool packs, and 2000 Barrels, besides all other necessary's for making an assault, kept all night on the Guard, and lin'd the Counter scarps as thick as he could, that they might be well defended.</P>
<P>The 21 their Majesties continuing in
<PB N="181" REF="94"/>their first design, the King for <HI>Charleroy,</HI> and the Queen for <HI>Compeigne,</HI> left St. <HI>Germain</HI> in <HI>Laye,</HI> and went and lay at the <HI>Louvre</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Montal,</HI> who had all the night been upon the Watch, expecting that the Enemy should attaque his Out∣works, or open their Trenches, was fru∣strated in his expectation; for betimes in the morning, Count <HI>Marsin</HI> sent away all his Wool-packs, Baskets, and Sacks to put Earth in, together with twenty pieces of Canon, and two Morter-pieces, to be carryed back to <HI>Namur.</HI></P>
<P>The 22. their Majesties went and lay at <HI>Verberye,</HI> which is a great Village almost in the mid way between <HI>Senles</HI> and <HI>Compeigne.</HI> At last the Enemies rais'd their Siege, and about day-break all their Troops, both Dutch and Spanish, discamp'd and march'd off; the Hollanders going by the ways of <HI>Marchienes-au-pont,</HI> and <HI>Fontaine-l'Evesque</HI> towards <HI>Binche,</HI> which they attaqu'd as they came from the Siege of <HI>Charleroy;</HI> and the Spaniards towards ..... where the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> Count <HI>Marsin,</HI> and some other Generals met, and after∣wards march'd towards <HI>Rennel, Viennotte,</HI> and other places, and then departed every one to their several Quarters: and among
<PB N="182" REF="95"/>the rest, Fifteen hundred Foot, and some Horse, which had been drawn out of <HI>Mae∣stricht,</HI> return'd thither.</P>
<P>The 23. Their Majesties arriv'd at <HI>Com∣piegne,</HI> which the King intended to leave and pass on further, according as he should hear from the Courriers; but those who arriv'd that night, bringing news of the Enemies retreat, made him change his mind; but being likewise told of the Hollanders sitting down before <HI>Binche,</HI> he resolved to stay there till he could further see into their de∣signs.</P>
<P>The 24, 25, and 26, their Majesties rest∣ed at <HI>Compiegne,</HI> and talk'd not of stirring thence, because of the return of the Dutch Forces to <HI>Binche;</HI> their Majesties were not willing to go back thence, till the Dutch were retir'd from before that place, which at last they did, after having beat down the Gates of it as a mark of their fury.</P>
<P>The 27, whilst the Hollanders venter'd their last stake before <HI>Binche,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> left <HI>Ʋtreeht,</HI> taking with him Two thousand Horse, and all the Foot he could make, and went to <HI>Woerden,</HI> where he would not stay, but made his Men march on
<PB N="183" REF="95"/>all night, intending to set upon <HI>Bodengrave,</HI> which was the Hollanders refuge, to which they us'd to retire, when ever they had ill success, as to an assur'd place of safety. So that the next day, in spight of the Thaw, the Snow, the Bogs, and Canales, in which he many times had like to have been lost with his whole Army, he came in good time to a Village call'd <HI>Wells,</HI> where the Enemy was quarter'd, and had cast up two Intrench∣ments, which he easily forc'd, with the loss of one only Soldier, who was kill'd by one of five or six shots, which they made be∣fore they betook themselves to their heels. From thence marching along a Dike, which made his march much easier then it had been hitherto, he met with six hundred more at a Village call'd <HI>Swammerdam,</HI> where they were entrench'd in all the Houses, from the windows of which they were very liberal of their shot, and port-holes for Canon, which were many. He attaqu∣ed them at two several places, at one of which the Count <HI>de Saulx,</HI> chief Brigadier of the Army, commanded in chief; and at the other, the Marquis <HI>de Moussy.</HI> And because there were two Bridges to pass, which were guarded by the Enemy, the Sol∣diers of their own accord, without being commanded, leaped into the Water, and
<PB N="184" REF="96"/>waded through it to beat them down, shew∣ing in such a voluntary action much of their courage and zeal; and so much the more, in that the Enemy made a very resolute oppo∣sition to their Designs, insomuch that they had like to be worsted, had they not been se∣conded by a party that was drawn out to that purpose, and advanc'd to skirmish the Enemy, which they perform'd so well, that they forc'd them to retire into the Houses of the Village to their Companions, where the Count <HI>de Saulx</HI> got almost as soon as they; and notwithstanding all their Shot, forc'd the Doors of all those Houses, and made himself master of them. The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> immediatly commanded them all to be fired, not sparing so much as that of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> in which many Men, Goods and Cattel were burn'd, to be reveng'd of him for assaulting the Castle of <HI>Marimont,</HI> one of the Kings Houses of Pleasure, which had been yielded him at the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle.</HI></P>
<P>After so many Toils, Perils, and so much Execution done, one would have thought it would have been but reasonable to give the Soldiery a little rest; and truly had they de∣sired it, they could not in reason have been denyed it. But it is to be admired, that
<PB N="185" REF="96"/>the Soldiers march'd on of their own accord, till they came to <HI>Bodengrave,</HI> where they found not that resistance which they expe∣cted, for the Count <HI>Koningsmark</HI> had quitted it with all his Troops.</P>
<P>At <HI>Compeigne</HI> their Majesties being certifi∣ed of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s retreat, resolv'd to return to St. <HI>Germains.</HI></P>
<P>The 29. Orders were given at <HI>Compeigne</HI> for their Majesties departure, and prepara∣tions made to set forward on the 31.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> who staid a∣while at <HI>Bodengrave,</HI> to give his brave Sol∣diers a little rest and refreshment, found him∣self necessitated to march on yet further: for being inform'd that some of those whom he had routed the day before, had not dar'd to stay at <HI>Niverburg,</HI> and by their fright so infected all those that kept the Garrison (which was most advant giously fortifyed) that they had all forsaken it; he thought himself oblig'd to march thither: where at his coming he found no living soul, only 21 pieces of Canon, 8 of Iron, and 13 of Brass fell into his hands, which he sent to <HI>Boden∣grave,</HI> to be secur'd by his Foot, which were
<PB N="186" REF="97"/>left there, the Horse and Dragoons having been all left at <HI>Woerden.</HI></P>
<P>After this, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> took his way homewards, having had as ill success in <HI>Flanders</HI> and the Country of <HI>Liege,</HI> as in Holland. And because Monsieur <HI>de Duras</HI> lay between <HI>Tongres</HI> and <HI>Charleroy,</HI> and had possest all the ways by which the Prince was to return, he was forc'd to go a great way a∣bout, to avoid meering any of the French Forces, which he dreaded above all things.</P>
