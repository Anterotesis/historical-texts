<P>Winter) and hauing past them, at last after he had trauelled sixe Moneths together, he arriued safely at <HI>Constantinople:</HI> Where, vpon the first day of <HI>May, 1612</HI> he had audience giuen him by the great Emperour of the Turkes, to the great honour and reputation of the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prouinces; and of the States ge∣nerall of the same: The Solemnitie whereof was in this manner performed.</P>
<P>The Ambassadour was conuayed vnto the great Turkes Court by <HI>Saphiler Aga,</HI> the chiefe Comman∣der of all the Turkes Horse-men: and <HI>Siaus Bassa,</HI> principall of all the Gentlemen in the Turkes Court; accompanied with an hundred <HI>Siausers</HI> all on Horse-backe, in such and the same manner, as they vse to fetch and conuay the Ambassadours of the greatest Monarches and Kings that are, vnto his Court. The Ambassadour hauing encreased his Traine with some Netherlanders as then resident in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> by reason that at the same time, there lay diuers Netherland-ships before the towne: and besides them, with some that were his good friends, both inhabitants, and others of other Nati∣ons, whom he before had knowne: whereby the ho∣nour of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> was preserued, to the great contentment not onely of the Turke himselfe, but also of all the <HI>Bassas</HI> of his Court.</P>
<P>The olde Captaine <HI>Bassa,</HI> for a signe and token of great affection and honour, caused the Ambassadour to ride vpon his owne best Horse, which was most sumptuously sadled &amp; brideled, wherin the Turkes, aboue all other Nations, doe specially shew their pride &amp; power. And so in great solemnitie the afore∣said <HI>Siausers,</HI> or the great Turkes Gentlemen, richly
<PB N="3" REF="2"/> clad and apparelled in Cassockes of cloath of Gold, Veluet, and Sattin, tode two and two before him: after them followed their Seruants, and some <HI>Ianit∣sers</HI> afoote, with two <HI>Dragomans,</HI> or Interpreters, on horse-backe: after them followed the Ambassadour, accompanied on each side, by the afore-said <HI>Saphiler Aga,</HI> and <HI>Siaus Bassa,</HI> and his owne followers, who as Gentlemen, (after the manner there) doe also kisse the great Turkes hand, and in that manner rode with a great applause and concourse of people to the <HI>Serralio,</HI> or Palace of the great Turke.</P>
<P>In this manner entering into the first gate of the <HI>Serralio, Siaus Bassa</HI> left the Ambassadour, and rode forward before him to certifie the <HI>Bassas</HI> of his com∣ming. In this first Gate there stood about <HI>60. Capit∣sers,</HI> or great Turkes Porters, with their Captaine, for a watch. Then approching to the second gate of the <HI>Serralio,</HI> the Ambassadour lighted from his horse, and was led in thereat by the arme, by <HI>Peichijs Bassa,</HI> principal of the Pages, apparelled all in gold, whose office is to conduct all Ambassadours vnto the pre∣sence of the great Turke: before this Gate there stood about <HI>100. Capitsers,</HI> with <HI>4.</HI> Captaines for a Guard, &amp; within the gate, were about <HI>300. Soubassas,</HI> which are Captaines of the <HI>Ianitsaries,</HI> each hauing a long white feather, like a Peacocks feather, on their heads. There all the <HI>Bassas</HI> lighted off from their horses, and went on foote to the <HI>Diuano</HI> (which is the Counsell-Chamber) wherein all the <HI>Bassas,</HI> with the principall <HI>Visier</HI> (representing the great Turkes Person) foure dayes euery weeke giue open audience to all sutors, and determine all causes of the whole Empyre.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<P>Hauing past through this Gate, on the one side of two long Galleries, supported with Marble Pil∣lars, there stood <HI>Ianitsarie Aga,</HI> the chiefe Commander of all the <HI>Ianitsaries,</HI> and of all the foot-men of Turky, with <HI>10000. Ianitsaries:</HI> and on the other side, <HI>Saphiler Agas,</HI> the chiefe Commander of the horse-men, with <HI>2000. Saphers,</HI> or horsemen, who altogether bowing downe their heads after the Turkish manner, with great reuerence, saluted the Ambassadour, he doing the like vnto them. There met him the <HI>Kihaia,</HI> or Commander of all the <HI>Capitsers,</HI> and <HI>Siaus Bassa,</HI> both of them being great Personages: they two led him into the <HI>Diuano,</HI> going before him with two long staues or wands of siluer and gilt ouer, richly appa∣relled in cloath of Gold, which is the greatest ho∣nour that can there be done to any man in the great Turkes Court.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Diuano</HI> sate the <HI>Cahimachan,</HI> with all the <HI>Vesier Bassas,</HI> who are chiefe and principall Counsel∣lers to the great Turke. Opposite ouer against the <HI>Cahimachan,</HI> there was a stoole set for the Ambassa∣dour. On his right side (which by the Turkes is held to be the vnworthiest, as being vnder the sword of another) sate <HI>Mahomet Bassa▪</HI> Admirall of Turky, betrothed to the great Turkes eldest Daughter, <HI>Da∣hut Bassa,</HI> marryed to the great Turkes Aunt, <HI>Ioseph Bassa, Chelil Bassa,</HI> and <HI>Nischanzi Bassa,</HI> marryed to the great Turkes Niece, whose office is to set the great Turkes name to all Letters Pattents, and publike Instruments that are granted and sent out by him. On the other side of <HI>Cahimachan</HI> (a resonable or in∣different space being left) sate the two <HI>Cadileschers,</HI> or chiefe Iudges of the whole Realme of Turky, and
<PB N="5" REF="3"/> on a seate alone the great <HI>Treasoror,</HI> being a <HI>Vesier</HI> also. Ouer against him, in a chamber, apart, there sate about <HI>300.</HI> Secretaries or Clarkes of the Tre∣sory, each of them being Auditors of a seuerall Pro∣uince, and vnder them their Clarkes.</P>
<P>The Ambassadour hauing for a while spoken and conferred with the <HI>Bassas,</HI> there was foure round sil∣uer tables brought in whereof one was set between the Ambassadour and the <HI>Cahimachan</HI> the second be∣fore the other <HI>Bassas:</HI> the third before the <HI>Cadileschers</HI> and the <HI>Treasoror,</HI> and the fourth before the <HI>Nischanzi Bassa</HI> and his company: and there they were feasted in sumptuous manner, with many sorts of meate, serued in great porceline dishes, setting but one dish downe at once after the Dutch manner. The Am∣bassadour eating with the <HI>Cahimachan,</HI> Captaine <HI>Bassa,</HI> and <HI>Dahut Bassa.</HI> In the middle of dinner, each of the <HI>Bassas,</HI> and the Ambassadour dranke <HI>Sorbetta,</HI> in dishes of gold, which is a kinde of drinke made of Water, Suger, and iuyce of Lemonds, mixed with Amber and Muske: whereof they dranke but once, &amp; no more: for the Turkes are very sober drinkers, and the great Lords vse to drinke no wine. The <HI>Mutpac Emini,</HI> or the great Turkes chiefe Cooke, hauing vnder him aboue <HI>2000.</HI> Cookes and officers in the Kitchin, stood to serue at the table, and below him stood about <HI>100. Teschnegers,</HI> or waiters, all with Cassockes of cloath of golde, setting the meate vpon the tables, and seruing at them. Of them the <HI>Beies,</HI> that is the Gouernors of townes, and Barons are made.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cahimachan</HI> gaue the Ambassadour the first cut of euery dish of meate, meane time the Gentle∣men

<PB N="8" REF="4"/> many precious Stones, all the Chamber being han∣ged about with most costly Hangings, embrodered and imbossed with Gold, the ground being Crim∣sen Veluet: the top thereof framed like a round tabernacle, all couered ouer with Golde, with di∣uers kindes of workes therein: this Chamber (be∣ing not very great) (when it is decked and hanged richly for to giue audience to any Ambassadour) is esteemed and valued to be worth tenne hundred thousand Hungarian Duckets, in English money, at seauen shillings a Ducket, <HI>350000</HI> pounds.</P>
<P>When the Ambassadour came before the great Turke, one of the <HI>Capitser Bassas</HI> tooke vp the skirt of the Turkes Gowne, which the Ambassadour stooping downe, kist: and then hauing done the ac∣customed reuerence vnto his Maiestie, two of the <HI>Capitser Bassas</HI> led him backward to the side of the Chamber, where in the side of the wall there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e furnished with rich Hangings and Cushins, but it is not the manner that any Ambassadour doth sit downe in the Turkes presence. The two <HI>Ca∣pitser Bassas</HI> stood still by the Ambassadour, then the <HI>Dragoman</HI> was led before the great Turke, and brought backeward againe by the Ambassadour, and after them the twelue Gentlemen orderly one after another: that done, the first <HI>Visier</HI> or <HI>Cahi∣machan,</HI> read a Petition before the great Turke, thereby briefly beseeching his Maiestie, gratiously to vouchsafe audience vnto the Ambassadour.</P>
<P>After that, the Ambassadour made an Oration in Latine, which by the <HI>Dragoman</HI> was presently interpreted in Turkish speech: and to when the Ambassadour had deliuered his Letters of credit,
<PB N="9" REF="4"/> together with the propositions afore-said in wri∣ting in a Bag of cloath of gold, according to their accustomed manner, by his Interpreter, to the <HI>Ca∣himachan,</HI> he was led out of the Chamber againe, doing the accustomed honour and reuerence vnto the great Turke, going backewards as afore-said, without any answer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m he Turke himselfe, or any of his <HI>Bassas,</HI> it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not their manner nor cu∣stome to doe it: and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> went out with a great num∣ber of Courtiers and Officers, vntill he came out of the gate aforesaid, on both sides saluting <HI>Ianitser Aga,</HI> and <HI>Saphiler Aga,</HI> being by them, and the <HI>Ianit∣saries</HI> and <HI>Saphilers</HI> likewise saluted as before. It is to be wondered at, that in the Turkes Court, when they sit in Counsell which is ordinarily foure dayes in a weeke, there assembleth at the least <HI>30000.</HI> men, all in pay and wages vnder the great Turke, be∣sides the <HI>Bassas,</HI> who stand there so quietly, and with so great silence, that in a manner they shew to be so many Images, without life or soule.</P>
<P>The Ambassadour with his traine, being on horse-backe againe, they were led a little aside (as the manner in that Country is) to see the Court and traine of the great Turke passe along before them, partly to honour the Ambassadours, and part∣ly to shew the great Turkes Power. And first, all the <HI>Ianitsaries</HI> about <HI>10000.</HI> in number, with a great noyse came out of the gate, and marcht before him, well apparelled, but without weapons. Then fol∣lowed <HI>500 Solachijs,</HI> or <HI>Bulucbassis,</HI> which are Cor∣porals and other Officers of the <HI>Ianitsaries:</HI> then a∣bout <HI>500 Soubassis,</HI> with long white feathers vpon their heads, which are Captaines among others.
<PB N="10" REF="5"/> Then on Horse-backe followed <HI>Stampol Aga,</HI> being the chiefe of all the <HI>Samoglanes,</HI> which are certaine young men and Children, which are giuen to the great Turke tribute: then the <HI>Perchimalgis, Ianigse∣ris, Iagischijs,</HI> the Clarke of the <HI>Ianitsaries: Solach Bassas,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Solachijs: Tagerschij Bassa,</HI> chiefe Hunter to the great Turke: the <HI>Chahagraby,</HI> or Lieutenant to <HI>Ianitser Aga,</HI> and his Substitute. Then on foote followed <HI>200. Soubassis,</HI> and then <HI>Ia∣nitser Aga</HI> himselfe, Commander ouer all the <HI>Ianitsa∣ries:</HI> after him followed <HI>100. Menegesians,</HI> all with Girdles of Siluer about one of their hands, which also are <HI>Ianitsaries,</HI> and each of them carry a Torch before the <HI>Aga,</HI> when hee goeth the round by night through <HI>Constantinople,</HI> as all the great <HI>Visiers</HI> and <HI>Bassas</HI> night by night are bound in person to goe the round, to preuent an such as seeke to doe any hurt or mischiefe, each of them hauing an Executioner with them, to punish all those that they finde doing any hurt or wickednesse, or that are in the streetes, according to the desert and merit of their offences, eyther by present death or otherwise. All the great Turkes Court hauing in this manner passed along before the Ambassadour; hee was againe conducted vnto his Lodging as aforesaid, and for a further ho∣nour, there was by the <HI>Bassas</HI> sent vnto him, two <HI>Pei∣chijs,</HI> or Pages, belonging to the great Turke, wea∣ring siluer and gilt Hats whereof there are alwayes a great many going about the great Turkes Horse, who although they are not accustomed to waite vp∣on any other man, no not vpon the great <HI>Visier Bassa,</HI> yet they followed the Ambassadour, on eyther side of him as hee was on horse-backe, till hee came to
<PB N="11" REF="5"/> his Lodging. For this Amitie and Friendship made betweene the great Turke and the vnited <HI>Nether∣lands,</HI> all the Turkes in generall much reioyced, so that as then it seemed to be a day of triumph, and from that time forward when the said League was first begunne to be made, they beganne to treate a∣bout the releasing of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> out of captiui∣tie, as also touching negotiation and traffique, to the which and, now already commandement is sent by the great Turke into <HI>Barbary,</HI> and other places, to declare the Peace made betweene the <HI>Netherlands</HI> and the said great Turke, and to command them, that from thence forth the <HI>Netherlands</HI> shall by them be holden and esteemed to be his Friends. This Treatie with the great Turke (for the which the Lord be praised) concluded and agreed vpon, with the greatest honour and reputation of the <HI>Nether∣lands</HI> that may be deuised, being made and signed with the great Turkes owne hand, and with his Oath thereunto annexed, was deliuered vnto the Ambassadour, vpon the sixteenth day of <HI>Iuly</HI> last past, being by him before for the space of sixe dayes perused, read, and in all defectiue places corrected and amended, in the presence of certaine men that vnderstood the Turkish Language, and were reque∣sted thereunto by the said Ambassadour.</P>
<P>By which meanes the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> haue obtai∣ned the best and surest Priuiledges in Turky, that euer heretofore haue to any Nation beene granted: for whatsoeuer the <HI>French-men, English-men,</HI> and <HI>Ve∣nitians</HI> in generall, or any of them in particular, by the Turkes speciall fauour and grace, haue obtay∣ned of him, it is all specially set downe in their re∣capitulation,

<PB N="20" REF="9"/> license and free permission vnto him, to haue accesse vn∣to his Court, for the execution of his Ambassage, as other Ambassadours and Gouernours of the Empyre vse to doe, as also to consult with the Lords <HI>Visiers,</HI> the Pro∣tectors of the Law, and specially the chiefe Iudge of Tur∣kie, which is a Lord of the holy <HI>Mufti Effendi,</HI> together with the Lords <HI>Cadi Esquieri</HI> (so the great men of the Land are named) and withall other his Gouernours about the same, and with his Maiesties aduice and consent, your motion of Amitie and Friendship sought and propounded vnto him, being well considered and aduised of by them, and they hauing fully and wholy declared the same vnto the great Monarch of the World, and the most mighty and vprightest King thereof (whom God preserue) by the helpe and assistance of God: his Maiestie freely and thankefully accepted of your good wils and Friendships, and hath placed the same among the number of those that are vnited vnto him in perfect Amitie and Friend∣ship: and hath determined and ordained that the same shall for euer be respected and maintained by him. And therewithall his Imperiall Maiestie hath commanded that wee should set downe and record the Articles of agree∣ment and vnite on both parts, according to your de∣sires, and also to make and send you a Letter in his owne Name.</P>
<P>And I also for my part, as your good friend, haue written this Letter; which, with his Maiesties, wee send vnto your Honours, wishing that by Gods grace, and in an happy and prosperous houre, the perfect Amitie and Friendship knit betweene vs, may in like sort long con∣tinue, which with all my heart I desire: for it is most sure and certaine that the supreame Lord of the noble house of <HI>Ottomans,</HI> and the Imperator of all other Rulers and
<PB N="21" REF="9"/> Lords in the World, our most Puisant Lord and King, is so truely vnited in fast and firme Friendship with your Honours, that from henceforth all the Fauours and Ho∣nours that may proceede and be imparted from his Im∣periall hands, vnto his Friends and Well-willers, shall be giuen and shewed vnto you, as by the Capitulation and agreement set downe and recorded he hath fully ma∣nifested and recorded, in such manner that all promises, and conditions, made and specified to be graunted vnto on his behalfe, within his Kingdomes and Dominions, shall be truely and faithfully obserued, fulfilled and kept. And my selfe your good friend, in like manner, will not faile to shew you all the honour and respect that may be, and will by no meanes endure that the least hurt or wrong whatsoeuer, shall be done vnto your Honours, (in your Subiects or Vassals) within these our Countries, for that the Word and Promise of our most righteous and ho∣nourable King, (whom God preserue) is for euer firme and stable, and most powerfull, in regard that his Ma∣iesties minde hath beene, and is alwayes addicted vnto peace and quietnesse, and specially desireth that his peo∣ple should liue in vnitie and peace, that vnder the shadow of his Imperiall Maiestie, they may so liue happily and at hearts ease. And seeing that the Lord of all the world hath granted you so great fauour and happy fortune to be vnited and ioyned in friendship, loue, and amitie with so puisant great and magnanimious a King, replenished with benignitie, grace, mercy, and compassion, as our Empe∣rour is: It is most certaine, and you may assure your selues thereof, that his Commandements and promises are firme and most sure, and that there shall be no contra∣rietie found therein, and assure your selues for certaine, that it shall not faile in any manner in regard that his
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages" DISP="〈2 pages missing〉"/>
<PB N="24" REF="10"/> be a meanes to procure the welfare of all Gods creatures, to their euerlasting benefit and good. Wee for a conclu∣sion say, that if on our side, all the Articles of agreement and Amitie, set downe and specified in the Treatie con∣cerning vs, and also all that which on your sides is promi∣sed, concerning the peace, in your Letters, be well per∣formed, maintained, and kept, according to the inward and affectionate friendship shewed and proffered by you with heart and good will; that so in time to come, all our affaires may the longer and the better haue good and hap∣py successe, wee hope and trust in GOD that in all the parts of the World, where Kings and Princes raigne, and shall heare and vnderstand of the Friendship and Peace made betweene vs, those that are our Friends will reioyce thereat, and such as with-stand the same shall feele the smart thereof. God bring this our proceeding to good end, and for your good and prosperitie.</P>
<P>Concerning your Ambassadour afore-said, whom wee must commend, we say, that not onely touching his Am∣bassage, but also in all the rest of the things belonging to matter of Estate, both in generall and perticular, hee hath done and performed the same with as much care and diligence as in him possible was, sparing no labour, tra∣uaile, nor care, neyther in place nor matter, nor in any of his proceedings omitted any thing whatsoeuer, which he knew, or by any meanes perceiued, to be needfull or ne∣cessarie to be propounded or moued, to bring these af∣faires to a good end. And specially comming into the pre∣sence of our most Puisant Emperour, (whom God pre∣serue) hee appeared there before him, with such honoura∣ble behauiour, grace, and curtesie, that it pleased his Ma∣iestie exceeding well, and moued him thereby to take great pleasure and contentment in him: and in all his
<PB N="25" REF="10"/> actions hath so behaued himselfe, that more could not haue beene done, not required at his hands concerning his charge. And to conclude, such a personage as hee (in the Superlatiue degree,) is fit to be an Ambassadour: in such sort, that all the Lord <HI>Visiers,</HI> my fellowes, and the rest of the Lords of the Emperours Court wondred there∣at, and said that such a man that should deale in publike affaires, ought to be such a one, as he shewed himselfe vn∣to vs to be: being altogether in great admiration to see his manner of proceedings in all his affaires, and for that cause, being so well pleased and contented with his beha∣uiour, were well content that hee should haue daily ac∣cesse vnto his Maiesties Court. Your Honours shall doe well to esteeme much of him, for that a man of his de∣serts and qualities meriteth to be preferred.</P>
<P>Thus hauing at this time, no more to say (hauing made a true relation of all that hath here beene done and past) but onely to wish health and long prosperitie vnto your Honours: wee leaue to trouble you.</P>

<HEAD>The Copie of a Letter, written by the Lord <HI>Mufti Effendi,</HI> chiefe Iudge of the Turkish Empire: vnto the generall States <HI>of the vnited Prouinces of the</HI> NETHERLANDS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Visant Lords of the Christian Law, and the honour of the Nations vnder the MESSIAS; my Lords, the generall states of the vnited <HI>Netherland</HI>-Prouinces, and most Noble Lord Prince MAVRICE: May it please you to vnderstand, that this yeere was sent vnto the Impe∣riall Palace of the most Puisant King, highly magnified and exalted; the Executioner of the Commandements giuen to the World in the Temples; the furtherer of Iustice, and the Vpholder or Restorer of Townes and Ci∣ties, the greatest and mightiest King and Monarch of the World (whose honour I beseech God alwayes to conti∣nue, and that his Kingdome may flowrish vntill the day of doome) your Honours Letters and Ambassadour, to treate of Amitie and Peace, with great reuerence and re∣spect vnto the high Court of his Maiesties Dominions; wherein your Honours haue done a thing worthy com∣mendations, and exceeding well accepted of, for that all those that desire to make Friendship, and to haue Peace with the King of the Noble House of OTTOMAN (whom God encrease in Honour, Power, and Maiestie vnto the
<PB N="27" REF="11"/> Worlds end) vntill this day haue not by any meanes en∣dured any losse or hinderance whatsoeuer, but haue there∣by attained to great profit and aduantage, which is ma∣nifestly knowne vnto all the World, and among all Nati∣ons, and all those vnto whom, or with whom, the most Puisant King (whom God preserue) doth make peace and contracteth Amitie, or that for their parts doe endeuour themselues to obserue and hold peace and Friendship with him, haue well experienced and tryed his great Fa∣uours, to whom his Maiestie hath continually doubled, and shewed his speciall grace and benignitie, which is a certaine signe and token, that in time to come, your Friendship proffered and obtained, shall more and more increase, and be so well ratified and established, that no∣thing whatsoeuer shall be cause to breake or infringe the same. For that the great Turke will shew your Honours such friendship, that in his Empire of Turky neyther you, nor any of your Ships, shall neede to feare any hurt or harme to be done vnto you in any thing whatsoeuer. To conclude, wee all together will continue your perfect friends, and be friends to your friends, and foes to your foes: and the further that you proceede therein, so much the more shall the benefit of his Maiesties fauours be seene, and your aduantage procured thereby, and in this matter which by you hath beene sought, all fauour and Friendship afford vnto you, although that in this point it is not vnknowne vnto you, how many aduersaries you haue had, who by all meanes and wayes possible, haue sought to hinder your proceedings herein, and to diuert it, that it might take no effect.</P>
<P>Therefore as I haue said, seeing that your enemies haue wrought thus secretly against you, it is great reason, that this League and Contract should be surely made, and ac∣cording
<PB N="28" REF="12"/> to your Letters, the Articles haue beene set downe, certifying you, that all shall be done as you de∣sire: and with all wee thinke that it was great reason that this peace should be established, and therefore our most puisant Emperour hath beene content gratiously to ac∣cept of your Friendship, and according to your Letters, the afore-said Priuiledges haue beene granted vnto vs: and that in all things whatsoeuer past concerning them, there hath nothing beene omitted that was requisite to be put in according to your desires. And for your Am∣bassadour <HI>Cornelius Haga,</HI> whom your Honours sent hi∣ther, hee hath performed his charge in that respect (in the Superlatiue degree:) and with great grace and ho∣nour gone through therewith, and hath executed the same with as much diligence as possible he might. Where∣fore I must needes say, that such a man as he is, deser∣ueth as well to be made an Ambassadour, as any one whatsoeuer of his degree, being of that Iudgement that hee is: the reason is, for that whatsoeuer hee hath done concerning this businesse of yours, hee hath done it ef∣fectually, and therefore it is requisite, that you take care, that no scandall may hereafter be procured thereby vnto you, and before all things to doe your endeuours that this Peace may continue firme and stable, for that it is euery way profitable and good for your Honours, and your townes. And vpon condition that your Honors shall keepe and firmely hold this Treatie, wee also will endeuour our selues to maintaine and vphold the same for euer: for our great and most Puisant Emperour (whom God preserue) is a courteous Prince, and exceeding gratious, and shew∣eth all the grace and fauour that he can vnto his friends, being an Emperour of great Honour and Maiestie, whose custome is alwayes to doe well.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="12"/>
<P>The Conclusion therefore of our Letter is, that what∣soeuer hath beene concluded touching this peace, you will take care to performe it to your powers. <HI>Moses Ieru∣salmi</HI> a Iew, hath beene a great furtherer of your affaires, as much as in him lay, and hath made mee acquainted with all your proceedings.</P>
