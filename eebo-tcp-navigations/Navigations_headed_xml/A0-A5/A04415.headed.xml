<HEAD>A RELATION OF the late Iourney of the Iesuits banished out of the Kingdomes of <HI>Bohemia, and Hungaria.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Ame (as I suppose) hath suffi∣ciently declared how all the <HI>Iesuits</HI> were sent and bani∣shed out of the Kingdomes of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Hungaria,</HI> that they might neuer at∣tempt to come againe into those Kingdomes hereafter: and this banishment of theirs was after this maner, that if any of those <HI>Iesuits</HI> be found in the two fore∣said Kingdomes, wheresoeuer, with whom soeuer, of what condition soeuer he be; and vnder what pretence soeuer; according to the definition of the Statutes of either Kingdome, he should pay the iust reward of his fact. The poore wretches are exclu∣ced, that neither intercession, nor any way deuised by art or friend should preuaile to bring them in againe for euer. Now I come to their going out, why doe they goe? Being once constrained to de∣part; they went away willingly, <HI>bona voluntas non est agitanda calcaribus,</HI> a willing mind needs not the spur. Constrained say you? namely, they would
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> depart for the time of anger willingly. This ba∣nishment and casting forth of them, although it brought exceeding much greefe and sorrow to their whole Society, euen as that same Bore sent by <HI>Diana</HI> into the corne of <HI>Callidonia:</HI> yet did it not altogether cast away the speare, but rather fol∣lowed that same most Godly sentence, <HI>(when they shall persecute you in that City, fly into another.)</HI> But who doe you aske? this was their recreation where∣by these wretched students distinguished the inter∣missions of their studies.</P>
<P>They doe too too much earnestly thinke that they are to search into these cares, where they may recouer a secure, and (as I may say) a healthfull place; such as they had left at <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Hun∣garia:</HI> and see, the euent was contrary to their pur∣poses.</P>
<P>While they went thither in this <HI>Bohemian. Hungarian</HI> banishment, that at length they might embrace faire <HI>Germanie,</HI> they come, they see, they salute their fellowes and bretheren. O <HI>Germanie,</HI> how great a wonder wert thou to these banished men at there first entrance, how diddest thou yeeld an allurement to those greedy eies! they see the goodnesse of the land: it is most wonderfull and remote from all danger: they see the temper of the aire; it is most wholesome. There is all sound and perpetuall healthfulnesse.</P>
<P>What should I speake of the florishing fields, the high hills, and the vnhurtfull chases? I will not
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y"/> speake of the little brookes sliding with a plea∣sant brinke, and the stately kinds of woods and groues. These, these seemed to the Fathers the <HI>Ie∣suites</HI> most full of a pleasant sweetnesse: the very midnight, which is wont to bee pleasant to all, they made vnquiet to themselues. And what would it bee (say they) if so pretious fleeces of sheepe, so many fertill Cities, villages and mona∣steries; and so good great a plenty of corne, oliues, and vine-yards should appertaine vnto vs? Oh brethren, let vs make tryall, let vs vse our best cun∣ning: that wee may be receiued first in <HI>Germanie:</HI> afterwards that wee may become Lords of it. Be∣hold ô <HI>Germany,</HI> how thou strikest without a bruise, how thou woundest without blood! how quickly and louingly thou doest drinke to these Fathers the cups of their desire and wish! how thou smi∣lest on them! O brethren, these men about to touch the matter to the quicke, doe put on them (as they are wont,) the prepuce of impudency; they solicite faire <HI>Germany</HI> with earnest and daily intreaty; that it would afford them a most safe defence against these clouds of banishment.</P>
<P>They cry out, thou ô <HI>Germany</HI> art the onely an∣chor, which art able to preserue this company, to chase away stormes amongst the waues and tem∣pests. <HI>India</HI> would most bountifully defend vs; neither would <HI>Italy</HI> deny vs any thing: but it is an exceeding long iourny thither; here the aire is most dangerous, that which way soeuer we turne
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> vs, an exceeding great burthen of this difficulty is laid vpon vs.</P>
<P>We haue no small cause to reside elsewhere: but now seeing our passing ouer hath a little tasted of this land (in which these that are addicted to our fellowship doe not liue in want) we conclude, that this thing is not done without the diuine proui∣dence. Also this <HI>Germany</HI> being better knowne through a processe of time, hath deserued to be a longer time loued of vs; and is accounted worthy to be adorned with the garland of our piety, and most faithfull instructing. Walke ouer and ouer it. O <HI>Germany,</HI> what is it, that our so many com∣panies doe watch in thy townes and houses for thy safety? other lands being let goe, wee desire thy helping hand, ô <HI>Germany</HI> (say they.) Let the holy Scripture moue thee; <HI>Succour the needy:</HI> Let it mooue thee, that thou maist follow mercy; <HI>excer∣cise mercy.</HI> Neither doe we request any great mat∣ters, nor things too high, onely some monasteries in which we may haue meate, drinke, and apparrell. In these monasteries we will liue religiously; we will shew our deuotion and loue towards <HI>Germany;</HI> and also our especiall care in instructing youth. And we, and others with vs shall fly with these winges, and shall exceed all humane matters. In the meane time although our innocency shall bring vs into a narrower roome and fame, yet shall it fly a∣gaine through all the coasts of <HI>Germany;</HI> and staine <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> vnlesse they become better.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y"/>
<P>Of which their wonderfull faire perswasion after that the brethren had made an end; the Lords the Delegates of <HI>Garmany</HI> not long meditating, at last doe answer thus. Neither doe they dissemble that they also are stirred and heated with that same vn∣timely heat. We haue beene very attentiue to your request (o Fathers): Also we haue attentiuely heard (as is fitting) your causes and reasons, prouoking vs to prouide you settled places amongst vs, which truely haue beene acceptable to vs. Wee would that our answere to you be plaine and without co∣lour. For that you extoll our beautifull Country, <HI>Germany,</HI> with all kind of prayses, we doe take it ac∣ceptably: onely this wee dislike, that you desire to rest with vs in this bosome which is proper and be∣longing to ours. And truely we do very much won∣der, that you do not seeke out and desire other pla∣ces fuller of our miracles. For although the ayre might be most dangerous in <HI>Italy,</HI> by your saying, perhaps it might bee more temperate in <HI>Spaine,</HI> where there be more of your companies; and more of your brethren. Yea there you haue your <HI>Meca∣nas</HI> himselfe, who as a <HI>Minerua</HI> doth preserue you on water, and as an <HI>Vlisses</HI> doth defend you being in danger of life.</P>
<P>Doe you say that the iourney into <HI>India</HI> is too long? It is shorter into <HI>France,</HI> where (if your apo∣logy may bee beleeued) your companions are of late preferred with new priuiledges. If you haue there so good opportunities, why doe you striue to
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> forgoe them? Doe you say it will be good for vs, hurtfull to you, to profit vs by your piety and in∣formation in our studies? It is not expedient for you (ô Fathers) if yee determine any thing to bee done of you in our right. And if we be not decei∣ued, <HI>Germany</HI> hath more certaine assertions of li∣berty to thinke well, then <HI>Trecensis</HI> heretofore in <HI>France</HI> (which is commonly called <HI>Troy.</HI>)</P>
<P>But we doe exceedingly maruell what the cause should be, why in so short a time ye should bee cast out of so many stately common-wealths and King∣domes? Truely all their fields are large bookes, which we cannot thrust vpon you by turning them, but for conference sake onely shew them as true to the whole world, and of you as yet not refuted We desire that some of you would behold your acts done in <HI>England: Certainly the acts of</HI> Garnet <HI>and of all of you would breath out some other thing then Innocency:</HI> namely, treason, and innouation, of which you were all guilty.</P>
<P>This one thing you obiect, (ô Fathers) but know this, a deepe wound retaines a scarce: Yee did not bid farewell to the <HI>Venetians</HI> against your wills; but perhaps vnconstrained.</P>
<P>You had neuer gone away by the decree of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Lords, had not the commandement of <HI>Paul</HI> the fifth Pope caused you, to whom being the head of the Church, you yeelded all humble obe∣dience with due obseruance: and in this intermissi∣on from Religion you adored his Surplice: <HI>So obe∣dience
<PB N="7" REF="5" MS="y"/> alone is the vertue which worketh the other vertues in the minde: and what were it of ye should call him Lord, Lord, and would not doe what he saith?</HI> Ah how impatient were the <HI>Venetian</HI> Lords of your departure? How willingly would they haue detai∣ned you longer, if good words, honours, if more∣ouer new priuiledges could haue preuailed any thing.</P>
<P>But in sayling we must giue eare to our Pilot, in warre to our Captaine: <HI>So that fidelity due to the Pope by the Venetian title hath made you wretched men banished.</HI> It is written: <HI>He that beleeueth shall be saued.</HI></P>
<P>We now talke alone (ô Fathers Iesuits) and are weakned: we could wish that a <HI>Venetian</HI> were here who might affirme these things.</P>
<P>We do adde nothing heere but what your selues had in your Apology: that the will of God may be done, who is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; from whom as you expect saluation, so al∣so expect iust iudgement. We do willingly passe ouer with silence the <HI>Belgicke</HI> fame, declaring what reproachfull things, contentions and wicked deeds you haue there committed: If in others there bee any disgrace and wickednesse, in you it is prayse and comelinesse (as it is in your Apology.)</P>
<P>We know not what to say, onely this wee hold, that God liueth, who causeth his Sunne to shine vpon the good and bad, and raineth vpon the iust and vniust, and will reward euery one according to
<PB N="8" REF="6"/> his workes: VVe do also willingly passe ouer, why wee saw your honest company banished out of <HI>France</HI> for their faults: wee are full of writings to this purpose.</P>
<P>In briefe, ye are accused of treason and slaughter intended against Kings: whose life and blood how you laid in waite for, would haue beene manifest (more cleare then the noon day) had not that same <HI>Carmelitane</HI> worke couered it vpon your Martyrs. Hereupon a Catholike within these three yeares (if I be not deceiued) obiected fairly vnto you that you teach and write commonly, that any man of what condition soeuer hee bee, may and ought to kill or slay a King (suppose any King you will) for a certaine stipend or pension of mony, if hee bee a Tyrant, or disobedient to your will and sayings.</P>
<P>This is your practise whereby you preuaile much with bad men: whereupon you deseruedly worship <HI>Henry Garnet,</HI> as a Martyr for that his wicked and sauage deed, who for it was executed in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>VVee ingeniously confesse that which is proper to all <HI>Garmans,</HI> that our Gallowes, Iibbets, prisons and all instruments of torture, are full of such Mar∣tyrs.</P>
<P>Let vs not cherish a thought of the feyned and lying miracles of such most false martyrs. We do euen tremble (as God shall help vs) that the Catho∣lique religion should couer such Barbarous, Sa∣uage, and most diuellish facts; and that it can call
<PB N="9" REF="6" MS="y"/> and worship such wicked and filthy men as Saints. So much euill was religion able to perswade. Nei∣ther were the winds the cause of their expulsion out of those most famous Cities of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Bohe∣mia,</HI> (we will not speake of <HI>Polonia,</HI> and <HI>Swetia:</HI>) These things shall neuer be forgotten, so long as that winged charriot of Fame shall passe through countries and ages. Yea haue beene shunners of peace and concord: yea haue brought in dissensi∣ons, braules, and treacheries into these kingdomes. All these you doe vnder colour of religion; as that your practise wrought by most fraudulent wiles, and most wicked attempts doth witnesse. This is it by which you wring your selues into high places; you flatter the eares of the chiefest men; being most skilfull in that matter: And so you couer your indirect going and sitting amongst these Peeres with the mantle of religion and piety (with a mis∣chiefe.) We also vnderstand (ô fathers vnlesse you haue some other religion then the Catholike) that you also, after your manner doe attempt the same: iust after the manner of Sorceresses; which while they can doe no harme to others, doe hurt them∣selues.</P>
<P>Amongst these excellent Estates of Common∣wealths, you bring in also an innouation: where those same good Catholiques are Atheists, Liber∣tines, and simple men, they are commonly called: yee doe all for this end, that treacheries and braw∣lings might be brought in, whereby you might fish
<PB N="10" REF="7"/> in safety for your company. And truly, not the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> and <HI>Hungarians</HI> onely, but euen your Catholikes, from elsewhere doe obiect the fame things vnto you. Where we certainly suppose this to be in the better part of you; grant vs ô Lord to speake forth peace in our times: All the turmoiles which you cause (your accusers alleadge) are made for religions sake (vnder this colour you affect your monarchy amongst the Catholikes;) yet not∣withstanding they must not be said to be vnderta∣ken of the professors of the Gospell at any time, for the cause of religion: O misery; we suffer not our cisterns to be drawne for all, whom we vnderstand you runne into.</P>
<P>For to what end is that plenty? But aboue all we set before vs the present estate onely of the <HI>Bohe∣mians.</HI> The seducers of the common people, say, that here is no talking of religion: ô blindnesse! Let them beleeue that will; they shall finde to their owne cost, that religion is our beginning, middest, and end: by which all things done, or to be done, are ruled; or rather in which they are all contained, your following, seuere, and harsh proceedings with <HI>Clostargrab</HI> and <HI>Braunaro</HI> shall afford you one liuely example of sixe hundred.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Emperour <HI>Matthias</HI> wrote very pre∣cisely in his late letters to the Earle of <HI>Bucquoy;</HI> Thou shalt deserue excellently well of vs, of out Princely house, of religion, and of the Common-weale; if thou wouldest admit of this religion,
<PB N="11" REF="7" MS="y"/> ô <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and wouldest entertaine friendship with the <HI>Iesuites,</HI> thou couldest not haue warre: The <HI>Pope</HI> would blesse thee; the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would salute thee, and all the whole Clergy would visite thee. But all these things ô Fathers, are vaine; vnlesse more weighty matters be behind. For yee pro∣claime and condemne all for Heretiks, which doe not obey the <HI>Romane</HI> Church, and yee teach open∣ly that no credit is to be giuen to them. In the meane time yee stirre vp the Peeres of this Realme one against another by your diuers waies and de∣uises: yee sow discord betweene the magistrates and the subiects; and by your vnspeakeable sub∣tilty yee cause variances in this Empire. By which your deceiptfull stratagem yee haue shewed your companions to be most deceiptfull; that your pro∣mises are esteemed as rotten nuts; yea a rusticke honesty is better than this your learned malice.</P>
<P>You promise all things vpon oath, but in the end you keepe none. And good reason: for what religion doth bind them to the law, whom their owne religion and the <HI>Popes</HI> Bull doe free from all bonds of Law? You make a politike mixture of those things which belong to the honour of God and his word, by saying; As though conscience were not so much to bee kept in politicke matters. Doe not we know these things (good men) we do altogether thinke with him, That there is no greater deceipt in all iniustice then is in them, who then, when they most deceiue,
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> doe it, that they may seeme to be good men. And truly, they seeme most strange to vs enquiring, why faith amongst the Iesuits should want followers: Afterward it was told vs that it was prouided a∣mongst you long agoe by a speciall edict, that any man may prouide for other good men by his last will; that faith cannot be said hereditary. All the true professours of the Gospell in the Sacred <HI>Ro∣mane</HI> Empire shall for euer endanger their liues and safety vnlesse they be carefull, prouident, and watchfull in these and such like matters. Good God, was it possible that these things should come to our cares?</P>
<P>Beleeue it (ô Fathers) euen your instruments and meanes by which you doe these things; much more your wicked deeds themselues are knowne to vs.</P>
<P>You haue Sermons; this is a great matter; which like a canker spread abroad: by which also you ayme at the end of the Oratour, which is, to per∣swade, and draw others into his owne opinion. To these are added your actions and most strange va∣riations in your behauiours and carriages, by which you allure the wayward common people; which do become the seller of victuals a iuggler or baud, beter then they become a Pulpet. As the Trecen∣sian iudgement in <HI>France</HI> is of Father <HI>Binet.</HI></P>
<P>Neither haue you Sermons onely (ô Fathers) but confessions also, this is greater: by these the condition of euery priuate house, and of the
<PB N="13" REF="8" MS="y"/> goodmen of the houses, the secrets of the whole common-wealth or Kingdome, where you liue; yea the secrets of the Romane Empire and their neigh∣bours are knowne to you. By these (we say againe) you deseruedly domineere ouer the consciences of men, and by compelling whom you will to vnlaw∣full things, you moderate all things by your owne reason: because it is written: VVhose sinnes you shall remit, they are remitted; and whose sinnes you retaine, they are retained.</P>
<P>By this place iniust contracts are made with you, commandements, or wicked and turbulent coun∣sailes are inioyned with a gentle buzzing, things iniustly gotten are kept still: loues and vnlawfull mariages are not onely not broken off, but often∣times are contracted: In a word, the court is kept here.</P>
<P>To these truely (that I may speake with you) pe∣netent men may bee compelled by the priest. For neither was power granted in vaine to the Apostles and their successors by Christ, as well to binde as to loose.</P>
<P>Lastly, (ô Fathers) this is your chiefest deuice: you haue two sorts of disciples here; all for your owne vse and profit: one of them, murtherers of heretique Kings and Peeres, as you call them. whom you neuer cease to incense and animate with all diligence and care, as also with promises of get∣ting perpetuall glory, and of escaping Purgatory. Who can here resist so many armed men?</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>
<P>The other sort of your disciples are the sonnes of great men, whom while you teach so, that when the perfection of wit in them shall come at length to the top and height of knowledge, you so binde vnto you, together with their parents, that you may haue sufficient by the helpe of these, wherewithall you may liue, and encrease your companies and religion. You instill Logike and Rhetorike into them, that they may be Sophisters. This, that they may defend any doubt, perswade false things, and open the doores to your companions amongst all men. There the truth is ouerwhelmed with deceiptfull distinctions sophistications, equi∣uocations, and mentall euasions; here it is ouer∣whelmed with a trimnesse of words, and with a <HI>Ciceronean</HI> eloquence. <HI>And I gaue my heart</HI> (saith the Preacher) <HI>that I might know Wisdome and Lear∣ning, and my Errours and folly.</HI></P>
<P>And not to omit the diuinity, which we heare that you reach, you haue a singular methode there∣in, (as becommeth singular men) by which all of your teaching doe expound the Bible philosophi∣cally, and Philosophy like Diuinity; so that <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI> may feed on the flower of their youth, Sathan may rightly challenge to himselfe the rest thereof.</P>
<P>O good Iesu, how these wicked men doe pretend with their Atheisme thy most holy name to the de∣struction of all mankind? But what boldnesse and rashnesse is it of yours (ô Fathers)? wee will not say impudency, that you should come out of the Pulpit
<PB N="15" REF="9" MS="y"/> (which was bestowed vpon you in <HI>Bohemia,</HI>) into the Court, and attempt to adminish the weight and worth of his Maiesties letters, by a diuerse inter∣pretation, and wrested explication of the words? that you read <HI>Elias Donat, Catoes</HI> Dislikes, the <HI>Compendium</HI> of Logicke, or the <HI>Epitome</HI> of Rheto∣ricke: when yee disputed the Letters not confir∣med by the Pope; wrested from <HI>Rodolphus,</HI> by the vrging &amp; constraining of the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> that you taught the sum of Phisicks, the extract of Metaphi∣siks, a breuiary of the whole world; whē you said that these letters were not subscribed of all: Loe wee sweare vnto you, that you had still remained in your rest and quietnesse, if omitting these publike, you had conteined your selues in your owne priuate matters, and in the meane time (being so busied) had better indoctrinated the children: So it falleth out as often as any transgresseth the limits of his profession, and so, I know not by what de∣stiny he is iustly punished for his curiosity: <HI>Nature hath giuen to all men to be happy, if any knew how to vse it.</HI> VVho also had this saying, <HI>Let euery one re∣maine within his owne fortune.</HI></P>
<P>Moreouer, O Fathers, you haue drawne to you wonderfull goods: and that you might be still dai∣ly more wealthy, you were come to that height, that leauing your priestly function, you were not ashamed to intrude your selues into the secular go∣uernment. Hereupon you are proclaimed the sub∣uerters of the common good, the enemies and de∣stroyers
<PB N="16" REF="10"/> of the kingdome, which custome of yours seemes very feeble. For the Kings of the gentiles beare rule: and they which haue power ouer them are liberall: But you not so, it is your part not to reigne, but to vse the rod, and to shake the feruloe within the territories of your kingdome. This we thinke belongeth to you (ô Fathers) that wee may speake truely. It is one thing to weaken, another thing to entreat, this belongeth to you. It is one thing to obey, another thing to command; that belongeth to you. It is fitting to keepe priests in the state of humility and obeysance. We (ô good Fathers) but that you goe in an outward shew and title of holinesse, which hath a shadow of vertue; would by these relations call your vile company, wicked, adulterate, to whom it is pleasant to de∣ceiue: they had rather haue a great name, then a good name: while they cannot be knowne by their vertues, they desire to be knowne by their wicked∣nesses. The end of your actions doth declare that, which is, to bring in subiection not onely these two Kingdomes, but the whole <HI>Romane</HI> Empire; yea all the whole world to the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Romish</HI> bon∣dage.</P>

<P> YEa it is not the least amongst the greeuances of the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> for which you are driuen out of that Kingdome, namely that by your helpes and perswasion truce is made betweene the <HI>Turkes</HI> and our men: onely that the strength of the house of <HI>Austria</HI> might be kept whole and sound for the rooting out of all Heretikes (as you terme them) out of <HI>Gremany.</HI> And hereupon you stirre vp a Bishop elsewhere in the City, that he would build a fortresse or tower, to the hurt of his potent neigh∣bour; and to the disprofit of all professors of the Gospell. The loue of the <HI>Dublines</HI> elsewhere kee∣peth no measure amongst the counsailers, whom you disgrace and staine with a <HI>Portugallike</HI> libera∣lity. Whereupon one professor of the Gospell is exceeding mistrustfull to another: and although they seeme to encline to friendship, we know not what hand oftentimes doth cause contention. O strife, ô cruell strife; ô strife sprung from the furies and hell it selfe. All excellency of true professours of the Gospell is by you troden downe, and (be∣hold the Authors of discord) is come to nothing. This (ô Fathers <HI>Iesuites</HI>) is your crafty deuice; by which you might giue from hand to hand the sa∣cred <HI>Romane</HI> Empire to the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Spaniard</HI> as perpetuall dictatours, but that <HI>Mercury</HI> the go∣uernour of sleepe had lately (although too too late) stirred vs vp.</P>

For your auncienter wickednesses in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> are odious vnto vs. Haue you not yet heard how some blood-sucker of your owne order in the yeare of our Lord, 1582. spake? but that we knew it was one of the Emperours house, we should haue sworne it had bin written in <HI>Caucasus.</HI></P>

<P>For what would it haue beene, if the <HI>Bohe∣mians</HI> or <HI>Hungarians,</HI> should haue contended
<PB N="19" REF="11" MS="y"/> any longer with words?

But get yee gone rather yee <HI>Iesuites,</HI> neuer returne into these Kingdomes. So the daies of the wicked shall be shortned.

Which thing is done; who can say it is ill done? furthermore the <HI>Bohemians</HI> are not priuy to any fault in your setting forth of showes: vnlesse happily passing by, they appoint a popular action against the act of eiection and banishment: which those crafty and nimble actours, and able knaues doe (we speak these things againe (ô Fathers) lest wee too much smart for them) not retained and kept in darknesse; but openly restored into the City <HI>Prague;</HI> and so the aire is a fresh infected. In the meane while (not nim∣ble in relating) the <HI>Bohemians</HI> doe wonder at your nimblenesse in dancing, accusing nature that shee made not you actors and tumblers. The report go∣eth (for what do we standing any longer vpon these) that in times past chastity and continency were amongst the Catholike brethren: wee beleeue it,

Ye shall know them by their fruites, as it is written. Where you intrude your selues, you make your selues Lords; these, seruants, which the Preacher foresee∣ing, saith; I saw the seruants riding, and the Prin∣ces walking on foot, like seruants. Marriages also are contracted amongst some (of which you are the authors) without the consent of parents: they talke of this in euery towne, village, and company in <HI>Flanders, Italy</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> You steale away their eldest sonnes; <HI>France</HI> doth witnesse this. You take away their onely sonnes from their Parents, that yee may afterward be possessors of their goods, and so relieue and help your owne companies.

<P><HI>Pliny</HI> (I beleeue) foreknewe this your religious∣nesse; saying, Many doe feare an ill report, fewe an ill consience. But you deale warily, in that you are not ashamed to teach openly, that you are sub∣iect to no gouernment in the world but to the Sea of Rome. Who therefore shall iudge you in these coasts? Shall the Pope? Vnlesse the <HI>Bohemians</HI> and <HI>Hungarians</HI> by chance doe come betweene: You teach the youth for nothing; but for no∣thing? This appeares by your Religious houses; by the most Princely and stately Theaters in them: on which you haue Comedies acted, ful of a poeti∣cal or Heathenish delights; How faith is not to be kept with Heretikes; How Euangelicall faith is to be rooted out with <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Caluin,</HI> and such like things, that you may bee the better emboldned, you spend whole daies with your Scholers in these delights &amp; pleasures; and the nights also doe you passe ouer on this wise: you are become so brazen faced through these your doings, that shortly you may learne to bee quite shamelesse. Hence it is no maruell that you are Winebibbers, Effeminate, stately, and full of money. Your Schollers bring you Gold as much as they can; that they may neuer ouerloade you. Is vertue to begotten after money? Wee let passe to speake of your companions in certaine well ordered Ci∣ties; that one example of Father <HI>Swares</HI> shall suf∣fice you, which we commit to your moyst memo∣ry in these things. But who are they whom you
<PB N="22" REF="13"/> teach for nothing? Are they poore? truely no; they are Heires of great riches and large Pos∣sessions. These will not suffer your Society to want for riches. We wonder that you know not these things. You know many things, and doe you not know your selues? The summe of Phi∣losophy bids; Know thy selfe. So no man know∣eth how much he knoweth not. You read <HI>Danus</HI> in <HI>Terence,</HI> but you doe not see how you disturbe and confound all things. You reade of the Gi∣ants in <HI>Virgill;</HI> but how you your selues doe wage Warre with heauen and all the gods, you doe not know. You reade of the <HI>Cyclops</HI> in <HI>Euripides;</HI> but you see not how you feare neither God nor man. Truely it is more then Cymmerian darknesse you are in; vnlesse you happily imitate <HI>Socrates,</HI> who knew onely this, that he knew nothing. But why doe wee prosequte these things with stile and words? One thing we adde of those huge ones, before we bring in the Conclusion. You Iesuits were meere Aeoluses, who sent your boysterous Northerne and Easterne windes vpon this age, and the whole Romane Empire: that you might onely obtaine the most cursed ende of your Sect; namely, the Monarchie of the whole world, and subiect all the Kingdomes of the World to the Sea of Rome. Hence doe troubles compasse vs about like vnto <HI>Numida,</HI> and new waues amongst the surges. O when shall wee be in that pure and certaine calme, which you haue couered with
<PB N="23" REF="13" MS="y"/> clowdes, that shortly will cause a tempest. The ashes which you spread abroad seeme to returne to you, ready to burne vp your Society. The ho∣ly Scripture saith, <HI>In the multiplying of the wicked, wickednesse shall be multiplyed, and the iust shall see their falles.</HI> But that wee may make an ende of these things which we say by the report of others, do not thinke (O Fathers Iesuits) that wee would hurt any of your Society hereby; for they are not ours: but such as long since were obiected against you by the whole world: which things, because you haue not answered; I thought good to mooue, not for vpbrayding, but for conference sake.</P>
<P>It is not possible (me thinke) that Religion and so many wickednesses should dwell together in one Colledge: which if you should suffer to reside vpon you, surely we would say that you are the worst of all that goe on two feete: whose bodies are hardened with so many skarres of villany and wickednesses, that there is no roome for another stroke. But, though we knowe no other by you, yet we hope better. For whither you goe; you immitate the Nouensilian gods. Doe you make speeches? your lippes are besmeered with <HI>Cicero∣nian</HI> eloquence. Doe you laugh? the Graces seem to be in your eyes. Doe you pray? All the Mar∣tyrs are beheld in your countenances. Doe yee line? you are chaster then the Monkes of <HI>Syria,</HI> called Escenor: so that if you should chance to
<PB N="25" REF="14"/> see dogges and bitches together in the street you would turne away your faces like <HI>Clotomicus;</HI> for they that haue honest mindes haue tender fore∣heads, as <HI>Simocus</HI> writeth. You are more abstinent from Wine, then <HI>Fulgentius,</HI> sometime Bishop of <HI>Ruspanary:</HI> you doe almost go beyond <HI>Elias</HI> who li∣ued in the Wildernesse neere the Brooke <HI>Carith.</HI> What are <HI>Paul</HI> the first Hermit, <HI>Antony, Hillarion, Patroclus;</HI> and others, in their austere solitarie liues, which are mariages in respect of your auste∣sterity? Will the world needs be deceiued? Let it be gulled, we speake sparingly of your praises, lest those truthes we tell should be blotted with a sus∣pition of flattery: we could not chuse but set down the things fore-mentioned that it might appeare what opinion Germany hath of you, and that we might hold you no longer pining in suspence of expectation, if you be not guilty of the aforesaide knaueries, surely there must be some secret auer∣sation, or contrarietie of nature which made these Countries spue ye out, as some mens stomacks do Cheese, or Fish, or Oyle, which proceeds not of any known cause, but from a certaine Antipothy of nature: wherof in imitation of <HI>Marshial</HI> the Po∣et we may say:

And now there shall be no more Pilgrimages taken to our Ladie of <HI>Loretto,</HI> or of <HI>Hales,</HI> saint <HI>Rorspine</HI> shall take vp all the custome, that shall robbe all other shrines of miracles, there shal we heare how many hath beene healed by the power of saint <HI>Rorspine,</HI> by the intercession of saint <HI>Ponus,</HI> here was one freed from a burning Ague, there another bursten guts healed: <HI>Iohn Fuks</HI> a souldier of Scotland reco∣uered his health by singular deuotion and cease∣lesse praier. <HI>Francis Rosse</HI> at <HI>Anwerpe</HI> was in the like manner cured of a dangerous melancholly disease by the same intercession: Another like∣wise of a lame Creeple was made as nimple as a dauncer: Another voyded a worme out of his body of a huge length. And this same saint <HI>Rorspin</HI> in the yeare 1610. did cure a certaine Irishman of
<PB N="29" REF="16" MS="y"/> the Falling sicknesse, and cast a Diuell out of a woman at <HI>Lewarden.</HI> Nay, the very name of saint <HI>Rorspine</HI> being vttered in the hearing of the sicke will make them as whole as a Fish. In the yeare 1602. when the plague was so ripe in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> it neuer touched this holy place, the inhabiters thereof were in so good health, that their skinnes were so full as they could hold for cracking: Be∣sides these, many Miracles are done in <HI>France, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> but there a man must beleeue them, and make himselfe blinde to see them.

Here may the <HI>Iesuites</HI> inioy all those recreations and pleasures which their minds or bodies incline vnto: haste your selues hither Iolly Fathers, the <HI>Amsterdamians</HI> do ernestlie looke for your comming, St. <HI>Rorspine</HI> and Saint <HI>Ponus</HI> expect your seruice, make no delay to hoise vp Saile for <HI>Amsterdā,</HI> good fortune wil blow

Thus the Iesuites flew out of the countrey as it were with the wings of <HI>Peggasus,</HI> and no maruell, for no man would hold vp his fin∣ger to stay them, whether Papist or Protestant. The Superior Commanders among the <HI>Iesuites</HI> rid thus in pompe, but the ordinary frye of them did laky it out on foot, and carried euery one his pack
<PB N="13" REF="17" MS="y"/> at his backe, and these were as proud as their ma∣sters that ridde, and would be thought to imitate the Apostles: and as they went in Procession, they chaunted a Letany to saint <HI>Rorspine</HI> making the fa∣berdum of their song, <HI>Nunc dimittis Seruos tuos Do∣mine:</HI> whereto <HI>Germany</HI> sung an Ecco, <HI>Iusta sunt iuditia tua Domine.</HI></P>

Why should they not be more iealous of them then of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. <HI>Spaine</HI> boasteth that the Em∣pire of the West is due to them by destinie, vpon this hope, they which had their beginnings from the Mores and Sarizens, goe on to worke their

This creeping Gangreine must be cut off lest it grow to farre in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> in <HI>Italy, France</HI> and <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> What Priuy Counsels of State are there in <HI>Germany</HI> vnreuealed to the <HI>Spaniard?</HI> Where hath he not in other countries his Pensioners for intel∣ligence, and his partie among the Counsellors of State linked to him with a golden chaine? What Diets or publike meetings haue we, the secrets whereof are not knowne to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> as well as to them that sit in those Parliaments? A thing most pernicious to our States, and dishonourable to the name of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>What Prince or people is there of the reformed Religion, whom the <HI>Spaniard</HI> doth not thinke he hath as iust cause to ruine, as to quell the Turkes or Pagans? Nor is this iust feare to be found in Pro∣testants, but it concernes them also that are pure Roman Catholikes. Were not the <HI>Fredirankes, O∣thoes,</HI> and <HI>Henries,</HI> thinke you, good Catholikes? yet drunke they of this cuppe. They that will not beleeue that all the Bishoprickes in the Em∣pire were promised by the Spaniard to the <HI>Iesuites.</HI> They that would rather haue the <HI>Spaniard</HI> rule o∣uer them then a <HI>Caluinist,</HI> or <HI>Lutheran</HI> Prince, let them expect the reward which he gaue to the <HI>Neo∣politans</HI> and <HI>Portugales: Vestram animam pertranscibit gladius:</HI> the Iesuites Creede is, that there is one God, one Pope, and one Catholike or Vniuersall King.</P>
