<P>Wee had thought to have given over printing our Forraigne avisoes, for that the Licencer (out of a partiall affec∣tion) would not oftentimes let passe apparant truth, and in other things (oftentimes) so crosse and alter which made vs almost weary of Printing, but he being vanished (and that Office fallen vpon another, more vnderstanding in these Forraine affaires, and as you will finde more candid.) We are againe (by the favour of his Majestie and the State) resolved to goe on in Printing if we shall finde the World to give a better acceptation of them, (then of late) by their Weekly buying them. It is well knowne these Novels are well esteemed in all parts of the World (but heere) by the more Iudicious, which wee can impute to no other but the discontinuance of them, and the vncertaine dayes of publishing them, which if the Post faile vs not wee shall keepe a constant Day every weeke therein, whereby every man may certainly expect them, and so wee take leave,</P>

<P>As for newes wee have but little, since the <HI>Imperialists</HI> have taken <HI>Friedberg</HI> they attempted nothing else, but lye still hereabout this City, and ruinate the whole Country, for yesterday they tooke by force the little Towne of Pomes, which was guarded by this City, where they made quarter according to their owne pleasure, but now the report goes, that they will goe to their winter quarter all except 6 Regiments, which are to besiege <HI>Crentznach,</HI> in the Dukedome of Wirttenberg, Palatinate, and Franconia the Imperialists and Davarians are to have their quarters, and the Spanish troopes on the other side of the Rhyne, so that the poore Palatinate, and other Countries thereabouts will be utterly ruinated againe. The Duke of Bavaria hath commanded <HI>Heidelberg</HI> and the whole Country to deliver up their accounts, what hath been contributed to the warre since the yeare 1622. which amounteth to a mighty summe of money, and the said Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> brings it all into his owne account at Ratisbone, to shew thereby how ma∣ny tunnes of gold the Palatinate hath cost, though the Pa∣latinate paid the mony it selfe, so that any one may easily see, what mind he hath to restore againe the Palatinate, in the meane time the Spanyards use great cruelty in the Pa∣latinate, insomuch that the poore subjects must give all what they have, and it is to be feared, that those of <HI>Heidel∣berg</HI> will have a hard winter. In the Dyere at Ratisbone the Ambassadours of the Imperiall Cities have agreed to contribute great summes of money for the maintaining of the Imperiall Army, which is to cut their owne throates.</P>

<P>SIR, I cannot let passe, to give you a briefe rehears ll of the sudden alteration here, viz. Vpon Saturday last the pro cur∣rant the Secretary <HI>Migel de Vas Gonsaluez</HI> was slaine in his quar∣ter in the Palace by the Nobility, and throwne out at the win∣dow in the <HI>Terrara de passa,</HI> where his corps did remaine all that day and night following, being footed and stript by the peo∣ple, his beard, eares, and some of his members cut off: and next morning it was conveyed in most abject manner to the <HI>Miseri∣cordia.</HI> Presently when the Secretary was slaine, the Gentry
<PB N="464" REF="27"/>rode through most streets of the citie, well accompanied and armed, crying, <HI>Viva Don Guan quarto,</HI> which was so generally received by the people, that there appeared not the least oppo∣position, all taking armes in the cause, appearing under their co∣lours in the <HI>Terra de passa,</HI> to wait the command of the Nobili∣ty, now Governours. The day was solemnized with joy, by ringing of bells, and discharging the great ordnance of ships in the river, which for the most part were English. Sunday the second of December, the castle of Lisbone rendred to the Nobility, and two dayes after the castle of Bellyne, for want of victuals, and now they are upon S. <HI>Guans,</HI> that doth yet hold out, but within few dayes will be forced also to render.</P>
<P>The King came to the citie two dayes since, and now is a stage building upon <HI>Terra de passa,</HI> for him to bee sworne and crowned, which the King doth desire to doe in the view of the world, to shew, as he saith, that hee comes to enjoy his right, which hath been so long detained from him.</P>
<P>The Portuguezes have showne such celerity as is to bee ad¦mited, there having not been in this accord, passing three or foure slaine, which made some resistance upon the comming of the Nobility to the Secretary.</P>
<P>The post from Spaine, Madrid, and Sivell, do not now goe, which will breed much alteration in trade, especially with such as are <HI>Cambia-dores:</HI> and likewise I doubt we shall find<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much alteration for our English commodities, all now changing the fashions of apparrell, leaving their owne, and imitate the Eng∣lish and French fashions what possibly they can.
