<P>The great Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> offers to fell vnto the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> the fe∣altie of the Princedome of <HI>Piumbino</HI> for 300000. Crownes, at the same rate as he would haue left it to the late Emperour.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Philiberto Viceroy</HI> of <HI>Sicilia,</HI> hath com∣manded 10. souldiers to bee hanged, and foure to bee condemned to the Gallies, because they had stolne 2500. double Crownes.</P>
<P>At <HI>Naples</HI> are likewise certaine Bakers condemned to the Gallies, in regard they mingled their Bread with Bran, and made it too little, so that it wanted weight.

<HEAD>From <HI>Lyons</HI> the <HI>28.</HI> of September.</HEAD>
<P>Our King is as yet here, but is (as many guesse) shortly to goe to <HI>Auignion,</HI> and to tarry there this next Winter, vnlesse there be an agreement made betwixt him and the Protestants.</P>
<P>The Constable hath laboured very hard to the same effect, and it was thought for the space of many dayes, that the peace was firmely concluded, and to cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fie his Maiestie of it, there were sent two Posts with all speed, out they broke suddenly off.

<PB N="3" REF="3"/>all warre-like preparation to oppose themselues against ten thousand foote and fiue hundred horse of the Arch∣duke <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> he expects fiue thousand foote more comming from the Emperour. The Baron of <HI>Batteuilles</HI> forces which were sent into the vally of <HI>Prettigaw,</HI> are for the most part defeated, and those which escaped relate that in the <HI>Grauebundts</HI> all things are very deare.

<P>The Galleyes of <HI>Pisserta</HI> haue taken an <HI>Hollandish</HI> Shippe, with diuerse Merchandizes.

<P>After the Count <HI>de Villamediana</HI> (who was of the House of <HI>Taxis,</HI> and Post-Master Generall) was slaine in the great street, by one which hurt him in his brest, and escaped vnknowne; the Count <HI>d'O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olo</HI> got his Office presently, and tooke the possession of the Coun∣tie of <HI>Villamediana.</HI> But there is one <HI>Lampeo Taxis,</HI> which likewise pretends to be his Heire, and will sue the other.</P>

<P>Vpon the 19. of this Moneth, the Emperor and the Empresse being to take Coach to ride to <HI>Ebersdorff,</HI> there came the Count of <HI>Thurn</HI> (who lately stole out of his Prison in <HI>Morauia</HI>) and falling before the Em∣peror vpon his knees, desired mercy and pardon, and obtained the same instantly at his Maiesties hand, and a promise to get also the Key of his Maiesties Chamber wholly.</P>
<P>The same day, about nine a clocke in the morning, was <HI>Powell Gould,</HI> who was condemned before, brought from the Red Tower, vnto a Scaffold made of purpose, beeing conducted betwixt two Iesuites, hauing the Night before confessed himselfe to be a Catholike. When hee had said his Prayers, they retyred; and the Officer hauing cut off his right hand, beheaded him: his body was buried afterwards, but his head and hand
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>were fastened vpon Poles, and set vpon the walls of the Citie, without the Red Tower, direct against the New Tower: his Confession is kept very secret.</P>

<HEAD>A Relation of certaine particular matters that hapned at Mompellier and other pla∣ces, before the treatie of peace was con∣cluded betwixt the King and the Protestants.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>From <HI>France.</HI></HEAD>
<P>T The last windes since <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> haue not beene so fearefull to many ships at Sea, as to the <HI>Spanish</HI> fleete going to conuoy the West <HI>India</HI> Nauie, whereof many of them haue bin driuen backe againe, as farre as to the coasts of <HI>England.</HI> The ships of <HI>Burdeux</HI> which haue bin shattered in harbour, the Gallies and Nauie of <HI>Marseiles,</HI> which haue beene driuen from <HI>Rochel</HI> to <HI>Brest</HI> in <HI>Brittanny.</HI> The ships in <HI>Plimmouth,</HI> which haue almost sunke in faire harbour, and the ships which at∣tend <HI>Subiss</HI> to waft him ouer into his country. As this businesse of <HI>France</HI> is to me in recounting the truth, and laying open the affaires and affrightings of the coun∣try, because the controuersie lies betweene a high ex∣alted Maiestie, and humbled subiects, whose shoulders yet lie vnder the pressure of displeasure, and the threat∣nings of a great and mighty Monarch. But because I began with a <HI>Simile</HI> from the Sea, and application of rough windes, I will keepe this slender Barke close to the shore, as well to auoyde the tempestuous waues in the channell, as the gusts frō the land, and rockes and shelues in some vnknowne coasts; and so I hope you shall haue nothing vnbefitting the Maiestie of a Chri∣stian king, nor vniustifiable in the report of an honest
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>relation. You haue heard then that his Maiestie hath proceeded so farre as the siege of <HI>Mompelier,</HI> where he not onely left some of his Nobilitie, namely, <HI>Memoran∣cy, Mompensier,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Angolesmes</HI> sonne, and o∣thers, but most part of his army, whereby he was not onely disappointed in his proiects, but very willing to cast vp another account of aduice, and examination of particulars, how to settle the affaires of his kingdom, &amp; keepe his honour integrate and vnmaimed, wherein without controuersie <HI>Lesdesguiers</HI> the new Constable hath not onely bin a great meanes of pacification of his Maiesties displeasure, but the maine motiue to oppose against that bloody doctrine of the Iesuites, who teach that nothing is so acceptable to diuine Maiestie, and mother Church, as slaughtering of hereticks, and extir∣pation of Protestants, whom they now character with the tearmes of <HI>Caluinists, Hugenots, Lutherans, Berneses,</HI> and diuers others; wherein I am, I protest so charitable, that some Nobles and Gentiles performe their outra∣ges, as <HI>Paul</HI> did his persecutions, <HI>in magno inscittae bello,</HI> and as for others, they exceed the very heathen, who were weary of sacrificing human blood to <HI>Mars, Sa∣turne, Diomedes, Pallas,</HI> and <HI>Berecinthia:</HI> so that you shall reade how <HI>Samos, Argos, Thebes, Taurica</HI> and <HI>Sicilia</HI> in those dayes began to suspect themselues, that they were not in the right, as long as the religion consisted of murther, and the death of innocents. But because I would not be tedious discourse, which the Reader expects to be triuiall, &amp; must passe through common hands as customary newes, you shall now only haue a Bill of Items, without any <HI>summa totalis,</HI> which I refer to your owne accounts, and Arithmeticall skill.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
<P N="1">1. Then they say, that the king being willing to heare <HI>Lesdesguiers</HI> the new Constable in his propositions for peace, left him to capitulate with the Duke <HI>de Rohan,</HI> about <HI>Mompellier,</HI> and hauing argued the matter with sufficient arguments, returned to Court very welcome to his Maiestie: but was there opposed by the Cardinal <HI>de la Roch foucalt,</HI> a very incendiary for the troubles, &amp; Monsieur <HI>Commartin,</HI> to whom the great Seale was gi∣uen, a great enemy of the Protestants.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Queene is falne sicke of the small pocks at <HI>Lions,</HI> which questionlesse will draw his Maiestie for the most part thither, whereas he determined to remain <HI>Chasteaubeau:</HI> so that there is great hope, that the for∣mer treaties of peace will come to a good period, and receiue some easie inductions, considering his Maie∣sties army before <HI>Mompellier</HI> hath not beene onely sha∣ken and dissipated, but is likely to fall a sunder with wants, diseases, losse of men, failing of money, and slacknesse of their prouision: the besieged resolued to maintaine the cause, and oppose against any threatning or violence.</P>
<P N="3">3. That two thousand fresh souldiers are newly en∣tred into <HI>Mompelier,</HI> conducted or conuoyed by 2000. more, who brought them safely to the very gates of the citie, passing and repassing without interception. For they returned quietly to <HI>Seuens,</HI> and were passed o∣uer the riuer, before the Duke of <HI>Angolesme</HI> came, who was marching to disappoint them, with the rega∣thered forces of the kings army: but as it should seeme they had dispatched their businesse before he came, and so it is apparant, the towne is not so hard besieged as it was, nor so likely to be endamnified, and yet the
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>army of <HI>Champaine</HI> is marching thither, and may of the kings forces recalled againe.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Marquesse of <HI>Mountbrun</HI> hath made a braue salley lately out of <HI>Nismes;</HI> and defeated the con∣uoy, which was to conduct the Popes Legat to <HI>Auigni∣on,</HI> but as I take it you haue heard of this before, onely I make mention of it again, because by certain Buls, In∣dulgences, and letters which diuers men of qualitie brought, and are all taken and broken vp, it is manife∣sted that his Holinesse enforceth and vrgeth the warre, and will by no meanes allow of any treaty of accord, without renouncing of religion: so that if a peace come (as a blessing) it must come vnlookt for, but the safest way is to looke sor no safety, according to the Poet:</P>
<Q>Vna salus nobis nullam sperare salutem.</Q>
<P N="5">5. That another sonne of the Duke <HI>Angolesme</HI> called Count <HI>d'Allen</HI> is dead in <HI>Perenas</HI> of a relapse of his for∣mer sicknesse: that Monsieur <HI>de Count de Schomberge,</HI> &amp; <HI>Canaples</HI> are troubled with the purples, a disease of danger and faintnes and that Monsieur <HI>de Plans</HI> and <HI>Arbault</HI> kept their beds, as not well at ease and discon∣tented.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> expected the great <HI>Gallion</HI> of <HI>Malta,</HI> of twelue hundred tun, &amp; another of his own of 900. before his embarking, but hee is gone without them, hauing receiued diuers petitions of Pirats to of∣fer him their seruice, which he hath sent to his Maiestie: but all is referred to his returning backe, notwithstan∣ding the former shiops are come to <HI>Burdeux,</HI> and so ap∣pointed to attend the great Nauy before <HI>Rochell.</HI></P>
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
<P N="7">7.

<HEAD>Another Letter from a person of credit at <HI>Paris.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LOuing Friend I haue receiued your late Letter whereby you desire mee to write vnto you what happeneth dayly in those partes, and especially those thinges which lately are past about <HI>Mompelier</HI> with all their necessary circumstances. Beginning at the first, I will let you knowe that the Marquise of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbrun</HI> (being of the Reformed Religion) hath ta∣ken but few dayes agoe, the Popes Nuncio with di∣uers Cardinals, and Cash-keepers, at <HI>Port Bodoyn,</HI> (be∣twixt <HI>Avignon</HI> and <HI>Nismes</HI> in <HI>Languedoc</HI>) from whence they intended to goe to the French King with diuers rich Presents, besides their memories and Instructi∣ons: Their Plates, Iewels and money, together are va∣lued aboue 200000. Crownes, and are made good booty for the Protestant Souldiers. Concerning the Siege of <HI>Monpelier,</HI> the French King hath had within these few Weekes two great ouerthrowes, The first happened in this manner, those of the Citty of <HI>Mom∣pelier</HI> to shew their Obedience vnto the King, promi∣sed free passage vnto his Forces, whereupon hee sent presently two Regiments to the Citty aforesaid,
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>whereof the one being entred into the same began to nestle themselues, the Magistrate espying their inten∣tion, desired them to passe through, according to the agreement and Promise made, but they answered that they had no such Commission. Whereupon the Magistrate perceiuing that they were not well dealt withall, Commaunded presently the Gates to be shut, and at the same time the second Regiment was ap∣proaching, and killed some of the Court of Guard be∣fore the Gates could bee closed: and gaue likewise directions that the Alarum should be rung, Where∣upon the Souldiers and Cittizens came forth in gene∣rall with their Armour and Armes, and defeated the Regiment aforesaid, within the space of few houres. But the Kings Forces without hearing the noyse of Shot, hoped that their Forces had ransackt the Citty, and began the Scale therupon of one of the Outworks of the same, but they were brauely repulsed &amp; many of them slaine by the Ordnance as otherwise. Amongst the Chiefe, were killed outright, The Duke of <HI>Fran∣sacq,</HI> Sonne of the Count of St. <HI>Paull.</HI> The Duke <HI>d'Alluyne.</HI> The Count of <HI>Allain,</HI> Sonne to the Count of <HI>Avergne.</HI> The Count of <HI>Rochefort,</HI> Sonne to the Duke of <HI>Monbason,</HI> Gouernour of <HI>Paris.</HI> The Marquis of <HI>Beuveron,</HI> Gouernour of <HI>Falaise.</HI> The Marshall of <HI>Themines.</HI> The Marquis <HI>de la Valette,</HI> the Sonne of the Duke of <HI>Espernon.</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Canysij,</HI> Gouernour of St. <HI>Loe:</HI> The Sonne of Monsieur <HI>d' Allicourt,</HI> Goner∣nour of <HI>Lions.</HI> The Sonne of Monsieur <HI>d' Montigny,</HI> Gouernour of <HI>Diepe.</HI> The Sonne of the Count of
<PB N="17" REF="10"/><HI>Chainbert.</HI> The Marquis of <HI>Cauillac d' Avergne.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst those which were hurt, the Duke of <HI>Me∣morancy</HI> Admirall of <HI>France,</HI> is since enred: What will become of the rest, namely the Duke <HI>d' Alboeuf,</HI> the Mar∣shall <HI>de Brande,</HI> the Marshall of <HI>Vitrie,</HI> and the Caualier <HI>Vendosme,</HI> the time will reueale it.</P>
<P>The second losse happened in this manner, The Duke <HI>de Roban</HI> on a morning came with 3000. Horse, and set vpon the Kings Campe, and was presently as∣sisted by those of <HI>Nismes,</HI> which likewise fell vpon the same Quarter, where Monsieur <HI>Sammet</HI> lay with his Regiment of <HI>Picardian</HI> Foote, which presently was de∣feated and destroyed, Salleying the Citty also at the same instant vpon them: Monsieur <HI>Sammet</HI> himselfe was slaine, besides 3000. of his men &amp; the whole Quar∣ter quite beaten vp. The Protestants nayled 10. Pie∣ces of the Campe, and those of <HI>Mompelier</HI> conuayed 4. other into their Citty, to the great reioycing and comfort of the Protestants.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>
<P>The Newes of the late peace giuen to the poore Protestants in <HI>France,</HI> as it was welcome to those that first receiued intelligence of it on Friday last heere in <HI>England,</HI> so, for that we know the certainty and the par∣ticular Conditions are generally desired, we here giue you the Articles themselues: which though they be or seeme to be very disaduantageous to the Protestants, yet they shew thus much; that they did not resist all this while with any will of Rebellion against their So∣ueraigne, but would rather at first haue yeilded vp their Townes whole and vndemolished, then thus rased and leuelled with the Earth. Againe, that they had rather expect a freedome of Conscience, and a cancēlling of the Edicts against them, and so relye for the continu∣ance of the Peace vpon the Kings Royall word &amp; Cau∣tion, then put themselues vpon a desperate Seruice, wherein they were sure to waste their Estates and Bo∣dies. Thus after a serious Consultation of the great Counsellors about the Peace, &amp; the losse of many No∣bles at <HI>Montpelier,</HI> which though it much incensed the King, it weakned him asmuch, and either party being well wearyed, these Articles were propounded and ac∣cepted which we here giue you, vntill the Conditions be at large sent ouer, which are shortly here expected.</P>

<P>THE Marquesse <HI>Spinola</HI> hath as yet done nothing, lying still with his Army in and about a Towne called <HI>Brecht,</HI> some 15. miles distant from hence, being as is reported 40. thousand strong: they are put to a great straite for want of prouision, in regard that all the Countrey almost heere abouts in maintaining so great an Army, is drawne dry. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> lyeth at and about <HI>Lillo,</HI> looking one vpon another, watching their aduantage: As for Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> with his forces are marched vp towards the Rhine, to relieue <HI>Papen Muts</HI> or <HI>Priests Cap,</HI> being very strongly besieged by the Enemies. This place is of great im∣portance to the States, in regard whereof <HI>Mansfield</HI> was no sooner marched vp, but presently <HI>Spinola</HI> sent <HI>Graue Henricke Vandenbergh</HI> with strong forces after him, to hinder the raising of the siege, so that if they meete, we shall shortly heare of more blowes.</P>
