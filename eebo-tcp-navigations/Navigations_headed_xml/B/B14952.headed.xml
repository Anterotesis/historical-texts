<HEAD>THE CONTINVATION OF our Weekely Newes.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Venice</HI> the <HI>24.</HI> of May. <HI>1631.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Oncerning the Peace now, there is no farther question made, since there are no more forces leavied. And besides this, the Governour of <HI>Mylan</HI> hath faithfully promised within the space of one Moneth, to establish a Generall reformation.</P>
<P>The Messenger which is returned from his Emperial Maj. Certifie, that notwithstanding his Maj. did not well like and approve of the agreement made at <HI>Cherasco,</HI> con∣cerning the <HI>Switzers</HI> at <HI>Suza,</HI> and <HI>Avigliano.</HI> Neverthelesse, he is now willing to stand to, and ratifie the same: to the end, that <HI>Italie</HI> might subsist in Peace and tranquility, and all these broyles and distractions, may be allayed and have a quiet end. And furthermore, that remainder of those Spanish forces in <HI>J∣talie,</HI> may be brought together, and march toward the lower-Palatinate, there to be enquartered. For all the Forces out of those parts are departed, and are at this present employed, some of them against the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the rest are marched into the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and are employed against the States.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Overlandt</HI> the <HI>26.</HI> of May.</HEAD>
<P>The troupes of Souldiers which late came out of <HI>Italy,</HI> re∣maine yet in full essence, and are dayly strengthened and aug∣mented. It seemes that whereas formerly, there solution was to bring them downe toward the <HI>Donou,</HI> the same no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is altered; those Forces shall be employed against the League, contracted by the Protestant Princes and Peeres at <HI>Leypsich.</HI> Especially, for the defence of the smaller Townes, as <HI>Memming</HI> and the like. Which at this present are in great danger, and extreamly threat∣ned, if so be they would not yeeld themselves to that League, and receive some of the Protestant forces, that then they shall presently be attached. Hereupon the Imperialists doe not onely expect the rest of their forces, but also certaine thousands more
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>of <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> to ayd and assist them. Wherefore men in these parts are much troubled and perplexed, and take great care how to dispose of all their troupes, and where they shall become, and how they shall be billetted and enquartered. His Maj. the Emperour, hath forewarned us in these parts, not one∣ly to provide for the enquartering of those <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Forces, which are to come, and are now upon the march, but also to find quarter for 25000. other forces, which shall bee newly raised.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Vlm</HI> the <HI>25</HI> of May.</HEAD>
<P>The Imperiall Forces from <HI>Jtalie</HI> being 8000. strong are yet hereabouts, they enforme us that certaine thousands more <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Forces are shortly to follow them.</P>
<P>They intend to blocke up <HI>Memmimgen,</HI> and will againe re∣duce the same under contribution, and bring it under the Em∣perours Iurisdiction. And for the ensuring of the same, they will lay in some Troupes for Garrison there. And doubtlesse as those of <HI>Memmimgen</HI> speed, we must look for the same, and not to fare better than our neighbours. Wherefore we of this Citie, the better to defend &amp; guard our selves, we have caused all the trees to be hewen downe, which stood before the <HI>Helbergate</HI> of this Citie. The Duke of <HI>Wirtenbergh</HI> with his forces, lyes upon the frontiers.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Berlyn</HI> the <HI>27.</HI> of May.</HEAD>
<P>The foote Forces of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at this present are at <HI>Posedan.</HI> And his <HI>Cavallerie</HI> is betweene the <HI>Dessaw</HI> Sconce, and <HI>Posedan.</HI> It seemes as we by all circumstances can gather, and conjecture, that his Majesty intends not to enquarter long in these parts. But doe rather thinke that hee will undertake some siedge or other. For his Majesty to that end hath caused many boards and other necessaries to be shipped. And forth of every Regiment he hath taken 400. horse, for to convey the Ordnance, munition, and other Sconce provision. The Lord Feeld-Marshall conducts an Army of 1000. men, which he doth dayly enforce and augment, and levies very strongly to that end. The Forces which were in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> are now on the march.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Franfort Oder</HI> the <HI>29.</HI> of May.</HEAD>
<P>All things here (God be praised) are in good being, and great and vigilant care is taken for this Citie: great paines day∣ly
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>is taken about the fortifications of the same. Within this Weeke were brought into this Citie, so many horses of the Im∣perialists, as made up 5. Companies compleat. These horses were taken grafing neare unto great <HI>Glogan.</HI> The Queenes Majesty of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaen</HI> sent hither lately two Camels richly Laden, to his Maj. with enformation, that God willing shee doth intend shortly to arrive at <HI>Wolgast</HI> or at <HI>Straelzondt</HI> her selfe in person. Yesterday here marched by 3. Regiments toward <HI>Crossend</HI> and farther into <HI>Silesia.</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>Statyn</HI> great forces are raised, and the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> causes an Army to be assembled to assault the Imperialists which are at <HI>Melchim.</HI> There are dayly and hourely expected 2000. men from <HI>Colbergh</HI> to march hither, and also 6000. from <HI>Ru∣gen.</HI> When these shall be arrived, his Maj. resolves with vio∣lence vehemently to assault <HI>Gripswolde,</HI> and afterward to con∣duct an Army into <HI>Mechelenbergh.</HI></P>

<P>The Prince <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> as also, the Marq. of <HI>Brandenbrugh,</HI> with their Dukedomes &amp; all their adherents, and Confederates, have yeelded and betaken themselves freely unto the defence &amp; protection of his Maj. of <HI>Sweden.</HI> The passage of <HI>Wirtenbergh</HI> is now also granted unto his Maj.

<P>The Merchants here must contribute to his Princely Excel∣lence of <HI>Saxony,</HI> 6000. and the rest of the Cittizens of <HI>Leipsich,</HI> 2000. Florins: and besides this sum, a generall contribution will be raised throughout the whole Dukedome.</P>
<P><HI>Magdonburgh</HI> by the reason of the late miserable and hide∣ous disaster happened there, is reduced to an heape of stones, being quite and utterly ruinated. There are not left standing a∣bove 60. or 70. houses about the Walles, and here and there an house at the corner of a Street.</P>
<P>His Majestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> causes a Ship-Bridge to be layd over the River of <HI>Elve,</HI> at <HI>Angermundt.</HI></P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Leypsich</HI> the first of June.</HEAD>
<P>Last Thursday the Prince Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> departed hence to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orgau,</HI> to muster, the new levied forces there, which are certaine thousands strong, he will returne from thence hither a∣gaine. He hath more Patents to levie other forces, both horse and foote.</P>
<P>The report here is very strong, that the Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> hath sent a Legate to our Prince Elector: to acquaint him, that very shortly he doth intend to come himselfe in person, to conferre with his Princely Excellence; declaring farther, that he had ob∣tained good meanes for the contracting of a Peace; which then he would propound unto him. And that he had full authoritie and Commission from his Emp. Maj. which <HI>Tilly</HI> hath consen∣ted unto.</P>
<P>Within <HI>Wirtenbergh</HI> at this present, are 1500. Souldiers, which were levied for the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> In their Ensigne they bare this Motto.</P>

<P>In other Ensignes which belong to the Forces of the Prote∣stant Princes is comprized this.</P>
<Q><HI>Not without cause, doe We maintaine this Cause.</HI></Q>
<P>The Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> causeth all the Ordnance (which he obtai∣ned in <HI>Magde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>burgh</HI>) to be convayed to <HI>Groingen,</HI> and hath also given charge and strickt command to two or three hundred Boores or Countrymen, to cast all those Souldiers which were taken Prisoners in the sayd Citie <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> with the Car∣kasses of the poore Massacred people, into the river <HI>Eive.</HI> But his owne Souldiers which were slaine in that expedition, hee yeelded extraordinary honourable buriall.

<P>The army of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> is pitcht about <HI>Brandenburgh, Ratenau, Nawen, Tremmen, Spandan,</HI> &amp; those quarters. The Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Marq. of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and more of the Vnited and Confederate Princes, have given themselves under the Protecti∣on of his Majesty of <HI>Sweden,</HI> &amp; have yeelded unto him the passage neare unto <HI>Wirtenbergh.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>The report is very strong here, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> doth intend to revenge the intollerable usage of the Imperia∣lists at <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> he hath some notable exployt in hand, wherefore he hath newly layd a Bridge over the River <HI>Elve,</HI> neare unto <HI>Angermunde.</HI></P>
<P>His Emp. Maj. hath denounced Banishment, and sorely threatned the Citie <HI>Neurezbergh,</HI> because they continue leavy∣ing of forces his Majesty therefore hath delivered the same Ci∣tie to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and strongly charged the said Duke to persecute those that are belonging unto <HI>Neurenburgh</HI> with fire and sword: as also all those that adhere unto them. But they regard not these threatnings, but doe proceed strongly with their raising of men. And not onely at <HI>Neurenburgh,</HI> but through∣out the whole Iurisdictions of all the Protestant Princes.</P>
<P>His Majesty of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath arrested and stayed certaine Mer∣chants at <HI>Spandau,</HI> who were journeying toward <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and required of them fifty thousand Ryxdollers, which they were constrained to pay, because they had in their company an Emperiall Commissarie, who had betaken himselfe into this Company, to be sheltered and so to passe for a Marchant, who otherwise in former time was run from his Majesty of <HI>Swedens</HI> service, unto the Emperour but now is in hold.</P>

<P>All the dead Carkasses are now almost convayed out of this Citie, which have sorely pestered and annoyed us hitherto, and above 2500. Citizens, which were slaine in the fury and burnt, are cast into the River <HI>Elve.</HI> There were many of them so dis∣figured with the fire, that it was impossible any way to dis∣cerne them who they were. Yesterday here was sung for Ioy of the taking of this Citie. <HI>Te Deum Laudamus,</HI> and the Ord∣nance of the Citie, three times discharged.

<PB N="8" REF="6"/>meanes to maintaine the Warres, now so requisite for the de∣fence and necessity of the holy Empire and States thereof; it would further and advantage the power of the enemies; cause yet a greater confusion, troubles and evils, and withall a farre greater mistrust and hatred amongst this Nation: Yea (un∣lesse it be with all speed withstood) it would bring into the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Empire of the <HI>German</HI> Nation (our deare Coun∣try) a new unquenchable fire whereby the same (which these 800 yeeres hath most sweetly flourished) would now at once bee consumed to ashes and wholly overthrowne.

<HEAD>Extract of severall fresh Letters written out of <HI>Germany.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe cruelty used by the Imperialists at the taking of <HI>Mag∣denburg</HI> (the like no History hath nor could ever make mention of) had indeed troubled many Protestants in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> especially the Elector of <HI>Saxen</HI> found himselfe much perplexed upon the newes thereof, when he likewise was much troubled and urged by an Imperiall Ambassadour and many other Messengers and letters, both from the Emperour and other Catholike Electors and Princes. Howsoever seeing by the example of <HI>Magdenburg</HI> what he and others of his Profession and Religion have to looke for at their enemies hands and promises, and considering the Imperiall Mandates and Proclamations, published (like a thunder) against the con∣clusion lately taken by him and other Protestant Princes and States assembled at <HI>Leipsick;</HI> and hearing withall of the doubt and feare divers made of his constancie in the said resolution, he both gave order for the greater speed in the levying of his owne forces and sent also severall Messengers to other Prote∣stant Princes, States and Imperiall Cities, with ample letters, whereby he doth not onely assure them of his constancie and proceeding in the performance of their resolution, But ex∣horteth them also, to make greater haste and to take more care than some of them did hitherto to prepare and defend themselves, representing the great necessity and danger, their enemies extraordinary arming, threatnings and executions would else bring them into. These
<PB N="12" REF="7"/>letters of his have very much rejoyced and strengthened all the good party, especially <HI>Norimberg, Strasburg</HI> and other good Townes, the most part whereof are already well provided and armed. But <HI>Memming</HI> lying some what aside and feeling already those Imperiall forces as came and yet daily come out of <HI>Italy</HI> (which amount to some six or seven thousand thereabouts) neere them, they feare (as being neerest to the danger) the execution might beginne at their Towne, howbeit they have as yet and doe still refuse any fur∣ther contribution and admittance of an Imperiall Garrison, where formerly they were subject unto.</P>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Saxen</HI> hath laid 10. or 12. thousand men up∣on his frontiers and makes great preparation.</P>
<P><HI>Tilly</HI> marches with an armie of 25000. men up into <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> either into the Dukedome of <HI>Wimar,</HI> as some thinke, or else towards the Country of <HI>Hessen</HI> (as is most likely) there to de∣feat the forces of the Circle of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> who have there their <HI>Rendezvous,</HI> and part whereof have lately defeated some of those Imperiall tsoops that <HI>Tilly</HI> had sent to hinder their said <HI>Rendezvous.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> (having firmed a royall Campe, since the Elector of <HI>Saxen</HI> did not grant him for his surety and re∣treate the Towne of <HI>Wittenberg</HI> to put his Garrison into, nor passage through his Country) expecteth more forces out of <HI>Prussia</HI> and from other parts; meane while he hath an armie in <HI>Silesia</HI> to which he hath sent some troopes for reinforcing and the better to oppose them all against the <HI>Jmperialists</HI> that in∣tend to besiege <HI>Crossen.</HI></P>
<P>Some of his Caualrie met lately with five Companies of Crabates that came out of <HI>Magdenburg</HI> laden with very rich booty they made there, which five Companies were all defea∣ted, and left all their riches (as if they had expresly fetched the same) unto the <HI>Swedish</HI> troopes.</P>
<P>The like good fortune befell lately to the Garrison of <HI>Wesell,</HI> who met with a convoy that carried much money towards the <HI>Spanish</HI> Camp, which convoy being also beaten left all the money behinde them in their enemies hands.</P>

<P>Our souldiers of <HI>Wesell</HI> and the neere adjoyning Garrisons 160 strong, have defeated a Convoy which was going from <HI>Culin</HI> to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> they were conducted by those of <HI>Rhynberk</HI> &amp; <HI>Orsoy,</HI> &amp; were set upon by our men neere about <HI>Deuren.</HI> In which exploit our soldiers obtained great booty 150000 Rix∣dollers in specie, much Silke &amp; other rich commoditie, swhere∣with divers Carts were laden. The rest of the bootie besides the readie Coine doth amount to the summe of 250000 Rix∣dollers, this bootie they brought into <HI>Wesell</HI> last Sunday in the vening and 60 or 70 serviceable horses, and 2 Ensignes. The spanish soldiers fled all of them, onely the waggoners, and some other labouring men opposed our men, and killed 3 or 4 of them, but there was no meanes for them to prevaile.</P>
<P>The Governour, Chancellour, &amp; Councell of the Province of <HI>Geldria,</HI> and the Earldome of <HI>Zutphen</HI> have prescribed a ge∣nerall day of meeting, the 17 of <HI>Iune</HI> at <HI>Nimmegen,</HI> where the whole countrie is to appeare.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>12.</HI> of <HI>Iune</HI> from the Army of his Excellence the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Whereas his Excell the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> had pitcht Armie at the side of the River <HI>Ley</HI> before the Citie <HI>Bridges</HI> the 3 of moneth, each one thought that his Excellence was of intenti∣on to approach &amp; besiege the said Citie. But now it appeares probably that his Excel▪ was not so minded, for he did not en∣trench himselfe there, but lay with his Army in the field onely. In the meane while certaine Committees were sent out of the said Citie in the name of the 4 parts of Flanders to treat with his Excellēce concerning the Contribution which was behind and had long time beene unpayd, insomuch that they gave se∣curitie for entire payment of 10 yeares contribution. Where∣upon his Excell with his whole Army departed, and the verie same night tooke his resting place at <HI>Maldegom,</HI> where we pas∣sed the 5 of <HI>Iune</HI> over the river <HI>Lieve</HI> towards <HI>Walichem,</HI> and from thence toward <HI>Eckelo,</HI> and <HI>Caprick,</HI> and the 7 of sune re∣turned backe with our whole armie at <HI>Watervliet,</HI> where his Excell. instantly caused retrenchments to be cast up all along the <HI>Holland Dike,</HI> for the better ensuring of his armie, so that in
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>case the spanish forces (which as wee understood had continu∣ally followed us) had come upon us, then had we taken the said Dike for our defence.</P>
<P>The 8 of <HI>Iune</HI> the provision of his Excell. was embarqued, and his horse troopes, being commanded presently as soone as they should be landed to march toward <HI>Bergen op Zoome.</HI> Ye∣sterday were all the Land-forces shipt, and all the waggons put aboard. The firelockes in the meane time stood in battle array, and held the watch untill all things were safely embarqued. Thus with the whole traine of our armie wee marched from <HI>Ysendyck</HI> to <HI>Rammekens,</HI> &amp; so downwards, sayling many hun∣dred shippes together, &amp; so forsooke the <HI>Flemish coasts,</HI> which country in this our expedition wee have wholly brought un∣der contribution untill the verie Citie <HI>Geudt.</HI> His Excellence in this expedition had a verie vigilant regard over his whole armie, and a speciall care that all things might be carried verie orderly, insomuch that hee caused many of his soldiers to bee hanged for their misdemeanours and insolencies committed against the inhabitants of the Countrie: But the like care was not taken on the other side, for many of our soldiers which did straggle somewhat out of their limits had by them their No∣ses and Eares cut off: Three soldiers wives with a child of 8 yeares were taken by the Flemish and hanged.</P>
<P>The same day that we came to <HI>Watervliet,</HI> the spanish that night arrived at <HI>Caprick,</HI> but did not shew themselves any neerer unto us. So that in this enterprize, wee have not met with our enemie to any purpose, and have found no resistance worthy of relation. Onely wee were informed that the ene∣mie brought his whole armie together, therewith intending to cut off all passages from our armie and hinder the victualls from comming to us. What shall follow hereafter in time we shall acquaint you.</P>

<HEAD>From Dort <HI>13.</HI> of Iune.</HEAD>
<P>The armie of his Excellence the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is returned againe out of Flaunders into these parts. Before this Citie are many ships laden with Ordnance, Munition, provision, and all warlike necessaries: Most of the horsemen were landed at <HI>Geer∣truydenbergh,</HI> &amp; presently hasted thence to <HI>Oosterhout, Gilsen</HI> &amp; other villages about <HI>Breda.</HI> The foot forces sayle all of them
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>toward the high &amp; lower <HI>Swalwe,</HI> and <HI>Geertruydenbergh,</HI> whe∣ther these also will land there the time will manifest. In the meane while here and in divers other places many thousands of loaves are baked for the armie.</P>
<P>The countrie people in the countrie of <HI>Heusden</HI> and <HI>Alte∣na,</HI> flye with all their goods and moveables from their country habitations into the Cities. Their Excellencies the States have prohibited preaching among the Catholickes in the Villages &amp; Townes belonging to <HI>S'hertogenbosch,</HI> so that all the Churches are shut up continually.</P>
<P>Wee have intelligence from <HI>Antwerpe</HI> with the last letters, that in the beginning of <HI>May</HI> the fleet of 25 ships at <HI>Lisbona</HI> is set sayle, among these are 15 Gallioons with 4000, some sup∣pose they are gone toward <HI>Calis Malis</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ioyne themselves to the <HI>Castilian armado,</HI> others are o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inion that they are bound for <HI>Cabo-verde,</HI> there to expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rest, and so to passe forward to <HI>Brasill.</HI></P>
<P>His Majestie of <HI>France</HI> is at S. <HI>Germani,</HI> and the Queene Mother is arrived at <HI>Paris</HI> with her whole family or house∣hold: But his Majestie had rather that shee had remained at <HI>Moulins:</HI> Her guard is now lesse than it hath beene neyther is shee so strongly warded as formerly.

<P>Norwithstanding the Commander <HI>Pinsen</HI> his ransome is readie, neverthelesse he is not yet at libertie. Count <HI>Henry van∣den Bergh</HI> questioning one day with him, what he thought the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> his enterprize might bee, hee answered him merrily, His Excellence is wise enough to conceale that from me, knowing that I cannot keepe counsell. The said count <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> is yet at <HI>Venlo</HI> with 3 or 4 hundred Marriners, it is thought that he will attempt something or other.</P>
