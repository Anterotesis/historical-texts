<P>The great and mightie Lord, with all his so great forces is vpon his march toward Poland, which whole Ringdome he is wholy bent to spoyle, &amp; fully resolued to make tributarie vnto the Turkish Empire: and with∣al meanes this Sommer to make way through the hart of the Kingdome, euen to the strong &amp; mightie Cittie Cracaw, further it is obserued that the Cossacks and Polanders, left and forsaken Podolia and are retired back vnto Poland.</P>

<HEAD>From Vienna in Austira the 21 of Iune.</HEAD>
<P>The Emperour haueing beene at Mariensel, where he had beene at his deuotion with the Archduke Charles, is now returned; in his passage through Mewstadt, the youg Prince of Anhalt being prisoner: haueing desired audience, &amp; withall entreating for mercie at the hands of his Imperiall Maiestie, whereof he was vtterlie de∣nied, yet was he the very same night visited by the Arch duke Charles, and was by him possessed of much com∣fort.</P>
<P>The English Gentelmen that was com to the Em∣perour, and had giuen his Imperiall maiestie to vnder∣stand, that the Lord Ambassador <HI>Digbie</HI> was vnder way: is by his maiestie sent back againe to the said Am∣bassador, for to aduise him to take his way towards Prague, and there to tarrie for his Imperiall maiestie: for he ment to betake himselfe theitherwards vpon the <HI>5</HI> of Iuly: but yet it is supposed as farre as men can con∣ceiue that, that his iorney may be deferred to some o∣ther time, because of y<SUP>e</SUP> Hungarian affayres where mat∣tecs doe not fall out according to the desire of the Em∣perour: especially considering y<SUP>e</SUP> the Count of Bucquoy could not by no meanes preuent nor hinder y<SUP>e</SUP> entrance of the <HI>4000</HI> men into Newhewsel which were sent thi∣ther for their succor and ayde: it is generally thought, &amp; that upon some good ground y<SUP>e</SUP> if the besieged can hould out but for y<SUP>e</SUP> space of thrée weekes longer, which with∣out doubt they can, for they want neither men, meat, munition, nor mony, but are sufficientlie prouided for of all necessahies, that Bucpuoy of necessitie shalbe for∣ced with all his leger to breake vp, and to returne back some other way, for <HI>Bethelem Gabor</HI> doth fortifie him∣selfe extraordinarilie strong with Turks, and Tarta∣rians being now wholy readie to march vp with y<SUP>e</SUP> same for the reliefe of Newhewsell.</P>

<P>Whereat the count de Bucquoy who haueing to lit∣tle purpose layen so long afore the Cittie Newhewsel in Hungaria, resoluing now to take a more serious view of the Cittie, to the end they might the better fit them∣selues in bringing their cannons to y<SUP>e</SUP> most conuenient places for battering, made out of their campe by night in tending with the breake of day, in the twilight to effect their purposes, &amp; to that end as is Bucquoy: Maxemil∣ian of Lightenser the Lord of Diepenbuch and others to the number of <HI>40</HI> speciall men of note went out, but whereas they went out <HI>40</HI> ther returned not the halfe as they went, for the Hungarians who slippe not away their advantage) liuing then in the woods next by, com∣passed them so about, that they went very neere to the taken or slaying of them all, and it was very narroulie that Bucquoy himselfe of escaped, but how soeuer it fell out that he esaped yet there remayned dead <HI>18</HI> and di∣vers of the rest sorelie hurt.</P>

<P>In Silesia vpon the Emperour his side it stands not well but very slightlie for y<SUP>e</SUP> cruell and bloodie execution at Prague the <HI>21</HI> of Iune of thrée Earls and Lord: <HI>7</HI> knights the rest Councellors and Cittizens to the num∣ber of <HI>47</HI> in all, hath bread such distast discord &amp; dissen∣tion euen vnto desperation of any hope of good mild or gentill dealings at the hands of the blood thyrstie Em∣perour, so that the said states of Silesia take on great store of men for their owne and counteries defence. In like manner the Marquisse of iegere Dorp lay there with his Souldiers who had strongly beset the Cittie Newes, &amp; the Earldome of Glets, besides that he was fallen into Bohemia wigh <HI>10000</HI> braue old Souldiers.</P>
<P>In respect whereof the Corronel <HI>Sassen</HI> was com∣manded that he should with his <HI>6</HI> cornets or companies of horsemen breake vp from Prague, and so march vp to Koningsgets, otherwise Kinggrets: likewise the Cor∣ronell of wallenstegn was ready with certaines com∣panies of foote to follow for the resistaunce of them of Iagerens dorp so much as possible they could.</P>
<P>It is also signified that the young Graue of Thurin who holds him by the Marquisse of Iagerens Drop be-<HI>4000</HI> men strong, is fallen into the Dukedomes of Re∣schen and Toppau, and therein taken the best passages and strongly beset the same. The Graue of Mansfield lies with his whole leger vppon the fronties of Bohe∣mia most in the vpper Palatinate.</P>

<HEAD>The Letter which Graue Mansfeld wrote to Bethelem Ga∣bor King of Hungaria whereby he shewed his Christian Resollution.</HEAD>
<P>Most Illustrious Prince mighty and puissant King most gratious Lord, and howsoeuer my gracious King and Lord, the great and bitter misfortune crossing his Maiestie in Bohemia, happening so much against him to the excessiue griefe and hart sore not of me alone, but also of all his true and faithfull subiects, yet on the con∣trarie, all true Christian Professors of the Gospel re∣ioyce no lesse to see and behold your Maiesties not one∣lie great loue manifested, but also your most heroicall and magnanimous hart, wherewith you affect both the Kingdome of Bohemia, and all the confederate Lands: and not onely so, but therewith all your great zeale for the planttacion of the Gospell, euen the true Religion and speciall care for pretecting all sincere honest men from the tyrannie of the Pope, and the crueltie of the Spanish yoke.</P>
<P>As for me I haue alwayes from the beginning vnto this present, to the vttermost of my power furthered, and wil not be backward in going on according to my dutie for the performance of my promise withall fidelitie, to his Kinglie Maiestie of Bohemia in the doing of al that shalbe profitable seruiceable, to my gratious King and Lord, as also to the whole Kingdome to my vtmost en∣deauours: In consideration whereof I haue alwayes
