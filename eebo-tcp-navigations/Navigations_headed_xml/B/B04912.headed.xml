<L><HI>By sad example of her Faithless Lover:</HI></L>
<L><HI>And so against them all she doth enveigh,</HI></L>

<L>SItting beyond a Rivers side,</L>
<L><HI>Parthenia</HI> thus to <HI>Cloe</HI> cry'd;</L>
<L>Who from the fair Nymphs Eyes a pace,</L>
<L>Another stream o'reflow'd her beauteous face,</L>
<LG TYPE="refrain">
<L><HI>Ah happy Nymph, said she, that can</HI></L>
<L><HI>So little value that false creature Man.</HI></L>
</LG>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft she perfidious things would cry,</L>
<L>They love, they bleed, they burn, they dye,</L>
<L>But if they'r absent half a day,</L>
<L>Nay, if they stay but one poor hour away:</L>
<LG TYPE="refrain">
<L><HI>No more they dye, no more complain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But like unconstant wretches live again.</HI></L>
</LG>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If that you do their Vows believe,</L>
<L>Then you are lost without reprieve,</L>
<L>For Maids that's credulous and free,</L>
<L>Are ruin'd soon by their inconstancy:</L>
<LG TYPE="refrain">
<L><HI>With sugred words they will trappan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>No creature ever was so false as Man.</HI></L>
</LG>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sad effects my self have try'd,</L>
<L>By one that vow'd for love be dy'd;</L>
<L>My pity overcame disdain,</L>
<L>And I requited him with love again:</L>
<LG TYPE="refrain">
<L><HI>Which makes me say with looks so wan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>No creature ever was so false as Man.</HI></L>
</LG>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For when I thought be lov'd me most,</L>
<L>He proved false unto my cost,</L>
<L>And like a fickle wretch did change</L>
<L>His mind, 'mongst other beauties for to range,</L>
<LG TYPE="refrain">
<L><HI>Therefore she happy is that can,</HI></L>
<L><HI>So little value that false creature Man.</HI></L>
</LG>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When I upon the flowry Plains,</L>
<L>Did feed my flocks, free from loves pains</L>
<L>And rested near the Christal streams,</L>
<L>Not once affrighted with such idle dreams,</L>
<LG TYPE="refrain">
<L><HI>Then could I say, 'tis I that can,</HI></L>
<L><HI>So little value that false creature Man.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>BUt since that love did me ensnare,</L>
<L>My Heart is fill'd with grief and care,</L>
<L>My looks are chang'd, and I complain,</L>
<L>Being requited with such deep disdain:</L>
<LG TYPE="refrain">
<L><HI>Then sure he happy is that can,</HI></L>
<L><HI>So little value that false Creature man.</HI></L>
</LG>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wild Beasts that in the woods do range,</L>
<L>Unto their mates are not so strange,</L>
<L>As men are to their Loves untrue,</L>
<L>Which makes poor simple maids so deeply rue.</L>
<LG TYPE="refrain">
<L><HI>And say, she happy is that can,</HI></L>
<L><HI>So little value that false Creature Man.</HI></L>
</LG>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You Birds that warble in the grove,</L>
<L>And hears the falshood of my Love:</L>
<L>Bear witness of my sad complaint,</L>
<L>Who am with grief and sorrow like to faint</L>
<LG TYPE="refrain">
<L><HI>Help me to learn, if that you can,</HI></L>
<L><HI>No more to value that false creature Man.</HI></L>

<L>The marble Rocks that do divide,</L>
<L>The foaming billows as they glide;</L>
<L>Not so obdurate are in kind,</L>
<L>As men who unto falshood are inclin'd.</L>
<LG TYPE="refrain">
<L><HI>Therefore she happy is that can,</HI></L>
<L><HI>So little value that false creature man.</HI></L>

<L>The Gods above will sure c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astise,</L>
<L>Such fickle Lovers treacher<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</L>

<L>You Virgins all who hear my moan,</L>
<L>Let me not languish all alone,</L>
<L>Come and assist me in my need,</L>
<L>Lest that my broken heart with sorrow Heed,</L>

<L><HI>Help me to learn if that you can,</HI></L>

</LG>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One of a thousand you'll not find,</L>
<L>That<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s true and bears a feithful mind,</L>
<L>But of your hearts they'l you bereave,</L>
<L>And then <UNCLEAR>disloyally</UNCLEAR> they will you leave;</L>
<L><HI>Then sure she happy is that can,</HI></L>
<L><HI>So little value that false creature man.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O that such falshood should remain</L>
<L>Within that heart whose deep disdain,</L>
<L>Hath brought me to so sad dispair,</L>
<L>As never for mankind again to care;</L>
<LG TYPE="refrain">
<L><HI>O let me say if that you can,</HI></L>
<L><HI>No more i'le value that false creature man.</HI></L>
</LG>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Into some Desart I will go,</L>
<L>And weary out my days in woe;</L>
<L>And with the Turtle there complain,</L>
<L>And never come in mortals sight again;</L>
