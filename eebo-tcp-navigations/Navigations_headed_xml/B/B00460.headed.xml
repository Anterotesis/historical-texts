<HEAD>A RELATION OF THE LATE INTENDED Horrible Treason against the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the <HI>whole state of the Vnited Provinces, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He last weeke we receiued and published certaine pri∣uate Letters concerning the late intended horrible treason against the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the <HI>States</HI> of the Low Countries; At what time the said Letters were written, little or no∣thing was knowne concerning the said Conspiracie, but since divers persons haue beene apprehended, and some of them examined, and tortured; vpon whose examination the <HI>States</HI> haue permitted some∣thing to be published to the world thereof, which I hauing receiued in the Printed Dutch Copie, I haue caused to be translated and Printed together with
<PB REF="3"/>the originall; vnto which I haue added the weekely Relation of Newes from severall parts of the world; assuring you, that so soone as more particulars shall come to my hand, by the like sure hand with good approbation you shall receiue it impartially, till when I bid you farewell, this 19. of February, 1622.</P>
<P>CErtaine dayes agoe, came certaine men to some sailers of the Barge or small Ship of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &amp;c., telling that they were Ingeners, and good Parriots, and relating that they had in hand certaine enterprises against the enemies, in which they were to be imployed secretly, and must cause certaine fire-works of Gun-powder and other mat∣terialls to be made readie, without reuealinge to any liuing bodie. For if they did otherwise and that it came to the light they should suffer punishment on their bodie, in regard of these and other speeches did the Sailers promise to assist them, and to keepe counsell for the good of the Country.</P>
<P>These Wolues in sheepes skinnes hoping that they should come to their intent, or purpose, one of the Traytors (as you shall heare hereafter) went to his pocket, and gaue each of the Sailers aforesaid three hundred Gilders (which amount to thirtie poundes sterling) to encourage them the better to the businesse, and told them if they made their workes well, and that they made good operations that they should be better rewarded. But they ad∣monished them againe to keepe secrecie aboue all thinges, seeing (as they sayd) it concerned mightily
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>the Countrey, and charged them to bring the fire-workes aforesayd as soone as they should be done, in Trunkes and Chestes, to the <HI>Hage</HI> and <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> from whence they should carry them, where it should be required, and they be ordered to transport them, assuring them to performe their promise, within the space of a certaine time.</P>
<P>One of these Traitors played afterward the Mer∣chant and bought certaine <HI>Pistols</HI> to send them (as he told) to <HI>Count-Mansfield,</HI> and others; These be∣ing packt vp in a Truncke and sent by his direction to the house of one of his consorts, who had a deepe Seller into which they were presently carryed, and tryed against a heape of sand whether they wold giue fire, &amp; were fit for their purpose. Afterwards he cau∣sed them to be packt into another Truncke, and to be sent to an Inne of the <HI>Hage,</HI> as it appeared lately.</P>
<P>About this time were the Conspirators and their consorts appointed to meete on seuerall places, where they intended to execute their wicked de∣signes. And amongst the rest, these Saylers aforesaid, came the 5. of <HI>February</HI> with some of their fire-works to the Inne appointed vnto them in the <HI>Hage,</HI> where they found diuers other men besides them which had set them on worke, vpon the deliuery of it the Saylers were very well entertained with drinke, and meate without any charge of their owne.</P>
<P>One of these Saylers perceiuing with an eye cast, that the partie who gaue him the mony, had some conference with a man of <HI>Bleyswick</HI> as he suspected, and tooke him, for such one, (as he was certaine off) to be no friend or well willer of the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>This Sayler musing about this, went to bed with one of his louing fellowes, and although he had well sup∣ped, neuerthelesse was his head full of strange con∣ceits, his fellow slept the same night very well, but he dreamed many seuerall dreames, and when he a∣waked he had many strange fancies in his minde, so that this night seemed very long vnto him, &amp; wished many times for the day light.</P>
<P>As soone as it was day light they rose with their other fellowes and laught about the dreaming, falling tumbling and tossing of the dreamer a∣foresayd, but he would not tell them what his minde did giue him and how he was affected. After that they two had tasted a Cup of <HI>Aqua uitae</HI> they went to∣gether walking abroad, the rest remaining yet by their drinke.</P>
<P>As soone as the Dreamer came on the street hee told to his fellow his late dreames, and what he had seene and obserued, the day before, and sayd in plaine termes vnto him, that he suspected these counter∣feicted Ingeners were plotting Treason, relating also that he thought it very cōuenient, to giue the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> notice of their setting at worke and pro∣ceedings and other circumstances, for (sayd he) if this be a thing which is for the good of the Country, without question the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> shall know of it.</P>
<P>The other interposing presently his Iudgement spake in this manner, It cannot hinder vs although we giue the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> notice of this, for if the matter be indeed intended for the good of the Countrey, we haue done it, and receiued therefore
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>three hundred Gilders, And if it be otherwise the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> will moreouer without doubt ho∣nour vs with a peece of money, or some drinke mo∣ney as they sayd, and we shall stand still in his fauour. To be briefe they concluded amongst themselues to reueale it to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> but feared that they should not be able and resolute enough to speake to his Excellency. But considering by them∣selues that it was a matter of great consequence, they went towards the Court, intending to try their for∣tune howsoeuer. When they came there, they per∣ceiued that his Excelency was rod abroad towards <HI>Risewick,</HI> (where is one of his Stables of horses) whereupon they went in all hast thitherwards, and discoursing by the way, made one another to beleeue firmely that it was but a foule busines which they had taken in hand. As soone as they arriued at <HI>Risewick,</HI> they found out one of the Pages of his Excellency and intreated him, to giue notice to the Prince his Ma∣ster, that they would faine speake with him: Here∣upon hee sent them word that hee was presently to take his Coach, and would come to heare them, Whereouer they desired the Page againe, to shew his Excellency that they would willingly speake with him instantly, euen about a businesse which concer∣ned himselfe mightily.</P>
<P>The Prince hauing vnderstood this, commanded his Page to bring these Saylers aforesayd vnto him, and when they stood before him, he asked them what their desire was, they answered, that they had some secret matters to impart with his Excellency. Whereupon he tooke them aside, and conferred pri∣uately
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>with them, and hearing of a thing of which he knew not before, he mused not vpon the businesse, but road in all hast to the <HI>Hage,</HI> and reuealed this matter at the meeting, or Counsell Chamber of the States: Whereupon there was giuen order that the 6. of <HI>February,</HI> (according to the new stile) in the yeare 1623. (as they reckon already, beginning their new yeare continually with the first day of <HI>Ia∣nuary</HI>) the <HI>Fiscall,</HI> or <HI>Prouost,</HI> or rather the <HI>Attourney</HI> of the Court was sent with certaine men, which at∣tended vpon him, to search the Inne or Tauerne (seeing the Dutch word <HI>Herberge</HI> which in this place is vsed, signifieth both) of the <HI>Helmet</HI> or <HI>Casket</HI> in the street called the North-end.</P>
<P>Comming there he asked the Hoste for the Truncks and the owners thereof, two of them which are named in the Proclamation hearing an inckling of this, stole secretly at the same instant out of the sayd house, comming away betwixt the Sergants and men which attended vpon the <HI>Fiscall.</HI> All the the other were stayed or arrested in the house vn∣till the <HI>Fiscall</HI> should come backe againe out of the meeting of the States, where he told that this was not the house, for the Hoste was much discontented, and sayd that he had no Trunkes of any lodgers or strangers in his house, But being afterwards infor∣med and perswaded to the contrary, he went to the sayd house againe, and searcht vntill hee found the Truncks, and ceased vpon the Hoste his Mayden-seruant beside three other men, amongst which was he who gaue the money to the foure Saylers, which being euen with the rest taken, were kept in a
<PB REF="5"/>Chamber at the <HI>Fiscalls</HI> house, vntill such time as the other had partly confessed the matter.</P>
<P>The Hoste and the other for all that they were mightily threatned, and strictly examined, would confesse nothing which had any likelihood or colour of truth. Whereupon there was presently or∣dered that the Souldiers which lay there in Garrison should instantly beset and stop all the passages to wards the <HI>Hage.</HI></P>
<P>This was not sooner performed, ere there came one of the Traytors aforesayd, in a Waggon which he had hyred to carry him to <HI>Delfe.</HI> The Souldiers perceiuing this Waggon, asked who was there, Whereupon he (knowing his Guiltie conscience) sprong or leaps from the Waggon intending to e∣scape by running away, whereby there arose a great rumor in the <HI>Hage,</HI> in such manner that euen the Townesmen armed themselues.</P>
<P>In the meane time there was a Sergant sent in all post hast towards <HI>Leyden</HI> to fetch the Hangman which put there the same day some Malefactors to the torture. So that vpon the fasting and prayer day (which was appointed by the States) after the Sermon in the Church was done, they were exami∣ned by the hangman in an other manner, which made them to confesse so much, that the <HI>Piscall</HI> was presently sent to the dwelling place of the widowe and children of <HI>Barneuelt:</HI> comming there he learned that his Sonnes were departed, although they were yet the day before seene walking in the streets, where∣vpon two of their seruants, and the Pedagoge or Tu∣tor of the children were apprehended, and the house
<PB REF="6"/>left in the custodie of the Sergeants.</P>
<P>When these Malefactors had now readie enough confessed concerning the said businesse, the States commanded the Saylers to be set instantly at liberty, and bestowed aboue 20. double Ryders of the Vni∣ted Provinces (each one of them amounts to twen∣tie-one shillings Sterling) vpon euery one of them. Wherevpon they went away with good content∣ment, and hoped according to the Tenor of the Proclamation, to get yet certaine thousand Gil∣ders.</P>
<P>On thursday night, there were yet three other of their consorts taken; and on Fryday one of <HI>Berc∣kel,</HI> and two of S. <HI>Hertoghenbosh.</HI> Their names I will yet keepe secret, to blame them not before they are found guiltie, and cannot cleare them∣selues.</P>
<P>The same Fryday it was rumored in the Court, that a Souldier had deserved alreadie foure thou∣sand Gilders, hauing taken one of them which are mentioned in the Proclamation.</P>
<P>Certaine Cittizens of <HI>Rotterdam</HI> and <HI>Delft,</HI> were taken the same Fryday, and the next Satter∣day.</P>
<P>The Confessions of the accused are kept verie secret by the States, and there is mightily doubted, whither the common people shall be acquainted with them, even for great and weightie reasons, see∣ing also the olde Proverbe sayth, <HI>That he shall seldome doe euill, who knoweth it not.</HI> And there are some which are well informed of their trayterous de∣signes, that will say, that there is no Chronicle nor
<PB REF="6"/>Historie which maketh mention, of such a Bar∣berous Enterprise, and relate moreouer that if it had succeeded, that the Pillars had beene fetcht from vnder out of the building, where∣by the vtter ruine of it would haue followed im∣mediately: That a great number of the Inhabi∣tantes should haue beene murdered, and blowne vp in the ayre besides them which should haue beene burnt, and slayne by the sword of our Enemies, which lay ready with many thousandes liering af∣ter this occasion and pray, which is for this time by the fauour and mercy of the Almightie fetcht as if it were out of their Iawes, he hauing heard the prayers of the faithfull. For it is most constantly reported that the murther of the Principall heades, and members of these Prouinces, besides the firing of the <HI>Magazins</HI> or store houses with powder, were intended vpon the late mentioned fasting day.</P>
<P>Here commeth daylie newes, and we perceiue it also, that diuers wicked persons of their consort begin to absent themselues, aswell hence, as from <HI>Rotterdam</HI> and <HI>Leyden,</HI> besides other places.</P>
<P>As soone as they bring here any one to the Prison, the people runnes together in such manner as if they were going to an assault.</P>

<HEAD>'T HAEGHSCHE DISCOVRS. Belangende de groote Verradery. Onlanghs ghehoort ende ghesien, met al∣len het gheene dat als tot in's Graven-<HI>Haegh ghepasseert is.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>EER</HI> Dircrete Cosijn, ick en hebbe niet na laten konnen V. E. mede te deylen van het gheene dat onlanghs ghebeurt is, mits sende u dit in ligghend Placcaen der H. M. Heeren Staten.</P>
<P>Over eenighe daghen, so fijn sekere Man∣nen ghekomen by eenighe Matroosen van het Iacht-schip van sijn <HI>Princelike Excelentie Graeff Mauritius van Nassou, Prince pan Oraengiuen, &amp;c.</HI> haer uyt ghevende voor Ingeni∣eurs of Yverige Patriotten. Woor-ghevende datse secrete aenslagen op den Vyandt hadden, waer toe datse hun moe∣sten laten ghebruycken, ende dit in aller stilligheyt eenighe vyer-werken van Boskruyt ende andere materie te maec∣ken, sonder te openbaren. Want soo sysulex tegen eeni∣ghen mensch vande Werelt te kennen gaven, daer door 't selve mocht ruchtbaer worden, so souden sy ongenwijffelt aen den Lijve gestraft worden, door dese ende meer andere redden hebben de Matrosen haer woort over gegeven, om
<PB REF="8"/>dit in aller stilligheyt t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t dienst van het Lant te doen, met diversche Discoursen tot der materie dienende. Dese wol∣ven in schaeps-kleederen alreede gevoelende, dat de sake wel wesen soude, soo heeft een vande Verraders als ghy hier na hooren sult. In sijn sack gheschooten, ende heeft elck van dese voorseyde Matrosen 300. gulden ghegheven, om dat het goede loon, den arbeyt versoeten mocht, met con∣ditie, soo dese Instrumenten wel gemaeckt waren, ende hare operatie wel deden, soo soude haer loon verbetert wor∣den. Maer voor alle saecken anderwherf vermanende dese saeck niemandt te openbaren, want het Lant daer veel aen ghelegen was, noch belastende, so haest dese dinghen ghe∣reet waren, souden sy de selve in Kisten, Koffers ter plaetse bringen, te weten, eenige in den Haegh, andere tot Rotter∣dam, om also voorts te brenghen daer 't selve haer belast soude worden, dit also beschict zijnde, met vaste beloften alles op sekeren tijt te volbrenghen.</P>
<P>Soo heeft een van dese Verraders den loosen Koopman gemaect, ende eenighe Pistolen op gekocht, om deselve te versenden naer den Mansvelt ende elders, dese nu all heb∣bende in een seker Koffer ghepackt, ende laten brenghen ten huyse van een haerder Creaturen, de selve in eenen die∣pen Kelder intsant dickwils afgeschoten, om te proberen, of de selve ooc vicx waren, naer desen de selve in een ander koffer met sijn toebehoor in den Haegh heeft laten bren∣ghen, in sekere Herberge, als gheschiedt is.</P>
<P>In middeler tijt, soo hadden sekere van hare Creaturen den weet om haer op sulcke tijt alsser bestemt was te laten vinden, elck een daer sy haer schelm stuck int werck souden ghestelt hebben. Dese voorseyde Matrosen oock op haer saken niet slapende, maer hebben een ghedeelte van hare Brantwerck op den 5. Februarij in den Haegh gebracht, daer sy vonden in seker Herberghe als gheseyt is. Desen man ende meer andere de welcke haer te werck ghestelt hadden, hebben sy het selve goedt over ghelevert, voorts werden dese Matrosen seer wel getra &amp; eert, van eten ende
<PB REF="8"/>drincken sonder hare kosten.</P>
<P>Een van dese Maets sagh met een swenck dat den ghee∣nen, de welcke hare't gelt gegevē hadde, eenighe correspon∣dencie met eennen man van Bleyswijck hadde, den welcken hy scheen te willen kennen, hy in hem selven overdenc∣kende, soude desen den Man wesen, de welcke ick my in bleede, so en kan dese saec niet also zijn, als ons 't selve aen gedient is, want desen Man en was gheen vrient vanden Prins. Desen Matroos met desen geladen kroop te bedde gaende, maer dien nacht by een van sijne getrouwe Maets slapende, al hadde hy wel te Lijue gedaen, so was doch sijn hooft vol vremde, ghedachten, zijn Maet wel gherust sla∣pende, hy somtijts wat dromende, en dan wederom wacker zinde, beeldende hem veel fantasien in, also dat dese nacht hem een halfe jaer langh scheen te zijn.</P>
<P>In middelertijt begint hy eenen vreemden droom te droo∣men,, alsoo dat hem docht datter diversche (dewelcke hy wel eer ghekent hadde) voor den dach quamen springhen, den eenen uyt den Bogaert, den anderen uyt het Bernende Veldt knaphandigh, van dit ghereetschap dat desen Ma∣troos ghemaeckt hadde, een Oly podery op sijn Spaensch begonste te koocken, ende na dat het selve op gheschept was, so quamen dese, onse Meesters ende schoncken het selve de Hoofden des Vaderlants. Desen dranck sy nu in hebbende, docht hem datse door de kracht des Salpeters op swelden, ende ten laetsten voor doot never vielen, waer onder eenighe sijnder bekenden waren, waer over hy van bedroeftheyt scheen gheluyt te staen, alsoo dat sijn maet ontwaeckten, hem aenstootede, mocht vragen wat hem deerden, hy wacker werdende, seyde ick ben blijde dat het een droom is, daer ick mede doende was, den ande∣ren hadde geerne al slumerende gheweten wat den droom geweest ware, maer hy seyde op morghen sal ick u den sel∣ven in het langhe ende breed vertellen. Na desen hy dese saeck wat na denckende, begonst hem selven schier verbaest te maken dat hy vande doode menschen, de welcke van
<PB REF="9"/>Beuls handen woot hare misdaet ghestraft waren, alsoo het hooft onder de Deken treckende, viel in eenen anderen droom seer vreemt, want hem dochte dat het gelt (dat hy van dese fijne Broeders ontfanghen hadde) in sijne Beurfe also begonste te swellen, dat int eynde sijne Beurse vant dicken berstede, het selve gelt op de arde vallende, begonst daer in te wortelen, ende een ander Transformatie aen te nemen. Ia in de rest, worden het selvighe kleyne Manne∣kens, vallende so dadelijck inde Princen Iacht, werpende den Prins met fiijn Broeder over boordt.</P>
<P>Eenighe Staten met den Koninck van Bohemen aldaer te gast zijnde moesten oock de Fock uytt houden, ende al∣len het Scheepsvolck en wist niet om haer lijf te berghen, nu eenighe van ons Scheeps-volck meende het eene ge∣deelte van het Schip in te houden. Maer eer langhe bltes onsen Trompetter eene anderen Alarm, ick te Loeff waert siende eenighe spaensche Galioenen op komen om hem voort te over vallen, ick dit dachte te sien heeft andermael gheluit geslaghen hem om smackende also dat hy uyt de Koy viel, sijn Macker van den slach ontwaeckten, ende nu int Bedt niet vindende worde meer verschrickt als hy sel∣ver, nu wederom opstaende, sijn kameraet wilden veel vra∣ghen, maer heild hem slapende om niemant suspicie te geven, also besweet van anghst den Dagheraet verwach∣tende.</P>
<P>So haest hy delelve ghewaer geworden is sijnse opghe∣staen lacchende met haer andere Maets van het droomen, maer niet te kennen gevende hoe hem te moede was: vor∣ders nae datse een soopien Brandewijn te Lijve ghenomen hadden; so zijn sy uyt wandelen gegaen, ende de anderen zijn daer blijven sitten drincken.</P>
<P>Nusoo haest sy byten den Huyse quamen, heeft hy te∣ghen sijn Kameraet sijnen droom vertelt, ende ooc wat hy des voorleden daeghs gesien hadde, also dat hy recht uyt seyde dat hy hem inbleeden eeinige Verradiy te wesen, ende daer goet vonden dese saecke den Prins te vraghen

<HEAD>An Admonition to all Christians.</HEAD>
<P>IT is no small token of Gods fauour, (beloued bre∣thren) that when he intends to punish or chastise his people, he forewarne them of the same, sending some messenger or signe before to diuert them from their wicked waies. <HI>Niniueh</HI> had experience thereof by ob∣taining a <HI>Ionah.</HI> The Israelites although heedlesse of the same, by being forewarned of the Babylonian cap∣tiuitie: yea <HI>Ierusalem</HI> the Citie of God, before their desolation vnder <HI>Vespasian,</HI> the true figure of that finall desolation to come. Some man may say, all that wee know right well: well then, how is it then that we at this day liuing in an age and time wherein all wicked∣nesse is broke loose, and hath got the bridle, as Pride, Whoredome, Theeuery, &amp;c. yea and to speake with the world, small sinnes are now adaies accounted no
<PB REF="21"/>sinnes, and the very greatest crying sinnes, are estee∣med but very small and trifling sinnes: I pray God grant that in sinning we triumph not ouer <HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha;</HI> and that compared with them, we doe not iustifie them. In a word, our sinnes crie vnto the hea∣uens for vengeance, and the reuenging hand of God is in wrath and anger lifted vp against vs: we haue had so many fore-runners (and fore-warners) who haue traced and trod the foot-steps and pathes of <HI>Ieremie,</HI> of <HI>Ionah,</HI> and of many others who haue fore-warned vs of the Lords indignation, and manifested vnto vs his anger, to see if wee would forsake the euill, and cleaue vnto the good way. But what hath all their crying holpen? Is Pride, couetousnesse, or any other sinne lessened or diminished? not a whit, for I pray God better it, we grow wilfull, euen as stubborne and froward children, and withstand and despise admoni∣tion, but woe vnto vs notwithstanding, if wee a∣mend not.</P>
<P>Behold here a new messenger, fore-runner or fore∣warner, a very sincere honest man, namely, <HI>Intien Ian∣sen,</HI> Elder of the Church of Christ at <HI>Oosterzee</HI> in <HI>Friesland:</HI> but I pray you vouchsafe but to reade his owne Declaration, which wee doe here present you withall; and setting aside all scoffing and mocking, you may thinke your selues hereby sufficiently fore∣warned to amend your sinfull liues, that so the punish∣ing hand of God so much threatned may be diuerted from you, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>IN the yeere of our Lord 1622. on the eight day of December about eight of the clocke at night. I
<PB REF="21"/><HI>Intien Iansen,</HI> being at the house of <HI>Hermken Roemerts,</HI> where hauing had some conference about Gods most holy word, yea and also of the great and heauie dissen∣tions &amp; warres, which we acknowledged to be the pu∣nishing hand of God meerely for our sins sake: here∣with hauing committed them vnto God, and so wal∣king forward toward the high-way; On a sudden I heard a voice crying, <HI>O woe, O woe, O woe;</HI> looking a∣bout me, and not knowing what this voice might be; the voice cried againe, <HI>O woe, O woe, O woe;</HI> and then I beheld, and immediatly I saw three persons, of a most wonderfull shape and proportion; whereupon I was sore affrighted and cast downe, so that I spake vnto my selfe saying, <HI>O gracious God and Father, protect me from all euill; be mercifull vnto me poore sinner.</HI> Then I spake vnto them saying, Are yee of God? then speake in Gods name; Are yee of Satan? then depart from me, or auoid: then they cried againe, <HI>O woe, O woe, O woe, vnto Brabant and Flaunders; If they repent not of their Pride, Drunkennesse, and accursed Idolatrie, they shall be destroyed by the sword, and perish in a bloud-bath:</HI> whereupon the one glistering like the Sunne, and ha∣uing in his right hand a fiery rod, which dropped all of bloud; the second being like vnto Death; the third hauing the shape of a Warriour, being bloudie vp to the very knees, hauing in his right hand a sword, which dropped all of bloud: Then said the first; <HI>Looke toward the South-west vnder my right arme.</HI> Euery place was then full of horse-men and souldiers, who to the knee waded in bloud: then he pointed mee, <HI>Looke toward the South-west vnder my left arme;</HI> and then the whole Land was full of dead bodies. Then they cried, <HI>O woe,
<PB REF="22"/>O woe, O woe, vnto Friesland; God can no longer beare the contempt of his most holy word, and the great oppression of the poore.</HI> Then said he vnto me, <HI>Looke vnder my right arme toward the North;</HI> where I beheld and saw a sump∣tuous Stage or Scaffold, each corner thereof being cu∣riously carued, with two gilded Lions, whereupon there were set and placed a great number of Shep∣herds, hauing staues in their hands, below there was a valley full of sheepe. I also saw that some of the Shep∣herds were clothed with strange apparell, sitting vpon the North part of the Stage, bearing no great loue vn∣to the sheepe; and hauing sent out a great number of Shearers arrayed in all kinde of apparell; of which Shearers also, some were in strange apparell clothed, hauing their sheares very sharp, wherewith they shore off the sheeps wooll, yea and that so neare, that in ma∣ny places they fleyed and fetched off the very skin, so that the bloud gushed out on the ground. Whereup∣on the sheepe began sore to grone, vntill I saw a man come clothed in strange apparell, hauing a foure-cor∣nerd Cap on his head, and a great basket couered with leather, out of which he fetched certaine letters, which he gaue vnto the Shepherds vpon the North part of the Scaffold, so that some of the Shearers went about to fill it with a great deale of the bloudie wooll; many of the sheep began to make a great rumour and noise, then I saw two great Wolues, hauing a number of Foxes by them, attempting to make an assault vpon the valley: whereupon the Shearers with their sheepe betook them to their flight, sore complaining on these strange Shepherds; vntill that at length there came an old Lion out of a Den or Grate, which Lion was be∣deckt
<PB REF="22"/>with Orange from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> number of yong Lions by him, who in a great furie surprized the Wolues, and all their adherents, worried and foyled them all: by which meanes the Shepherds with their sheepe obtained peace, with much rest in vnity, and the wooll of the sheepe began to grow againe. Then hee said vnto mee, <HI>Looke vnder my left arme toward the North,</HI> where the sheepe are changed and turned to men, euen to Citizens and Husbandmen, the Shep∣herds were clothed with long furred gownes, the Shea∣rers with long cloakes, hauing broad swords or han∣gers by their sides; then I saw that in many places in <HI>Friesland</HI> the Husbandmen with the Citizens did rise vp against their Gouernours. Then I began to consi∣der what it meant: and then they cried, <HI>O woe, O woe, O woe, vnto all Germany or Dutchland, if they turne not from and repent them of their sinfull liues, the Lord God will punish them with warres and dissentions, plague them with pestilence and with deare times, vntill they wholly pe∣rish and come to nought, euen to nothing.</HI> Then he pointed me, <HI>Looke toward the East vnder my right arme:</HI> And I saw a great Eagle with golden fethers, which Eagle had thrust out another faire Bird out of his place and residence, yea worried him, and had almost driuen a∣way all Birds out of their places of residence. Then he said vnto me, <HI>Looke toward the South-west vnder my left arme;</HI> Then I saw a great Lion giuing fire and flame out of his jawes, and then I saw how with great furie and spite he ouercame; establishing the foresaid faire Bird in his former place and residence againe, to the exceeding great comfort of all the other expulsed or banished Birds. All which Birds vnto the Lion
<PB REF="23"/>yeelded great thankfulnesse. Herewith they commit∣ted me vnto God the Father, charging mee I should make this thing knowne, and publish it vnto all men, so that if they repent them not of their sinfull liues, then shal the Lord God let all these plagues fall vpon them within the terme of two yeeres. Then shall there come a time of peace, so that loue and peace shall encrease and grow on: then when they vanished away, I went home, where lying vpon my bed musing and medita∣ting vpon these great difficulties, and with my selfe concluding, and resoluing, not to publish or make knowne the same. Whereupon I apprehended a very cleare resplendent light, and looking vp, I beheld three Visions or Apparitions, which gaue me three heauie stroakes; one vpon my right eye, the other vpon my right side, so that of mine eye I became starke blinde, and therewith they vanished. And then with great griefe of heart I resolued to make it knowne: besee∣ching all faithfull and honest hearted Christians, both night and day to call vpon the Lord God by prayer, and earnestly beseech the Lord God, that hee will be gratiously pleased to turne from vs all these plagues, euen according to his owne Diuine and godly will.</P>
