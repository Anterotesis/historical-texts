<HEAD>The Distressed <HI>Welshman.</HI></HEAD>
<L>IF any ask her what her am,</L>
<L>her is a Shentleman,</L>
<L>If you will not believe her, then</L>
<L>go into <HI>Trinity Lane:</HI></L>
<L>For there her was born and bred,</L>
<L>and afterwards begotten,</L>
<L>And there her hopes to lay her head</L>
<L>when all her bones are rotten.</L>
<L>All you good people that intend</L>
<L>to recreate your mind,</L>
<L>Read o're this story to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd,</L>
<PB REF="2"/>
<L>peruse these simple Lines.</L>
<L>Upon a time it chanced so</L>
<L>that <HI>Taffie</HI> did decree</L>
<L>To leave her Country for to go</L>
<L>to seek her destiny.</L>
<L>Now her prepares for her depart,</L>
<L>and bids them all farewell,</L>
<L>Her goes away with all her heart,</L>
<L>this shourney likes her well:</L>
<L>Was travel up to <HI>London</HI> town,</L>
<L>to see the City brave,</L>
<L>Her in the streets walks up and down,</L>
<L>what thinks her was a slave?</L>
<L>No, her hath money in her poke,</L>
<L>although her friends are small,</L>
<L>Nay, more than this, her hath a cloak</L>
<L>to cover her withal.</L>
<L>And as her walkt along the street,</L>
<L>the City for to see,</L>
<L>A sheating quean doth <HI>Taffy</HI> meet,</L>
<L>and robs him craftily.</L>
<L>Now he perceives when she was gone</L>
<L>his mony all was lost,</L>
<L>And after her in haste did run,</L>
<L>it is no time to boast.</L>
<L>But all in vain, for she's too swift,</L>
<L>she leaveth him behind:</L>
<L>Now he to study some new shift,</L>
<L>applies his angry mind:</L>
<L>Now her laments her evil fate</L>
<L>and bitter destiny,</L>
<PB REF="3"/>
<L>For her is left to such a state,</L>
<L>her knows not where to lye.</L>
<L><HI>Cots plutter-a-nails</HI> he then replies,</L>
<L>her knows not what to do:</L>
<L>For her hath seen her better daies,</L>
<L>and bid them all adieu.</L>
<L>Her dotn lament and weep for grief,</L>
<L>at her unhappy loss,</L>
<L>Her seeks about for some relief,</L>
<L>but all in vain it was:</L>
<L>At length her came into a shop</L>
<L>where Meat was to be sold,</L>
<L>He sits him down, begins to knock,</L>
<L>the Knave was somewhat bold.</L>
<L>Her doth begin and thus doth say,</L>
<L>her was a shen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leman,</L>
<L>Her time was short nor cannot stay,</L>
<L>for her must soon be gone,</L>
<L>Her business at the Court remains</L>
<L>her thither must retire,</L>
<L>Or else her loses all her gains,</L>
<L>O her was not a Lyer.</L>
<L>And then his Hostess all in haste,</L>
<L>brought to him riches store,</L>
<L>And he by turn on each doth taste,</L>
<L>there is no need of more.</L>
<L>In little time he doth suffice</L>
<L>his hunger that was great,</L>
<L>And from the table he doth rise,</L>
<L>leaving but little Meat:</L>
<L>And then he calls a little Boy,</L>
<PB REF="3"/>
<L>thus unto him he said,</L>
<L>I give thee this, stay here while I</L>
<L>go see the Reckoning paid.</L>
<L>The boy more greedy of his gift</L>
<L>than of his Masters gain,</L>
<L>To eat all he makes great shift</L>
<L>while <HI>Taffy</HI> runs amain.</L>
<L>This being done, mark one thing more,</L>
<L>now he hath made escape,</L>
<L>He calls to mind the day be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore</L>
<L>her lost her whole Estate:</L>
<L>Therefore her walks the streets along</L>
<L>to see if there were any</L>
<L>That could redress poor <HI>Taffy</HI>'s wrong,</L>
<L>or help him to his money:</L>
<L>And as he walkt he met the quean</L>
<L>that pickt his poke before▪</L>
<L>Was coming to him once again</L>
<L>to see if there were more.</L>
<L>When <HI>Taffy</HI> saw he knew her face,</L>
<L>and runs to her with speed:</L>
<L>But was done to his dis disgrace,</L>
<L>as you'l hereafter read.</L>
<L><HI>Cots plutter-a-nails,</HI> this is the Thief</L>
<L>did steal her money from her,</L>
<L>And robb'd her of all her relief,</L>
<L>now her doth seize upon her.</L>
<L>This made the Welshman for to smile,</L>
<L>though he her self did know,</L>
<L>Before this bout a little while</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er served her Hostess so.</L>
<PB REF="4"/>
<L>This Cheat for fear of future wrong,</L>
<L>did to the people say,</L>
<L>He rob'd me as I went along,</L>
<L>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d so her run away:</L>
<L>The people hearing her report,</L>
<L><HI>Taffy</HI> away they hawl</L>
<L>Into the Sessions-house Court</L>
<L>to plead before them all:</L>
<L>And as they drag'd him through the street,</L>
<L>although his case was poor,</L>
<L>It chan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed so that he did meet</L>
<L>the Cook he rob'd before.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> must endure the heat,</L>
<L>before the Judge he's brought:</L>
<L>The Cook indicts him for his Meat,</L>
<L>the woman for his fault:</L>
<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> knowing what was done,</L>
<L>nothing at all did say,</L>
<L>But at the last to speak begun,</L>
<L>was rob'd the other day.</L>
<L>Her sheating trot was pick her poke,</L>
<L>and robbed her by craft,</L>
<L>Then her was forc'd to pawn her Cloak,</L>
<L>none other help was left:</L>
<L>And the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her self doth wander to</L>
<L>a Victualling-house with speed:</L>
<L>Was call for meat was tell to you,</L>
<L>her hunger for to feed:</L>
<L>When her was come into the House,</L>
<L>her Hostess brought good store,</L>
<L>And her doth taste of every dish,</L>
<PB REF="4"/>
<L>while her could eat no more.</L>
<L>Now her was going for to pay</L>
<L>for what her self did eat,</L>
<L>And as her lookt another way,</L>
<L>her spies▪ me this shame sheat.</L>
<L>Then her pursu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d her while at last</L>
<L>was catch'd her by the arm;</L>
<L>And she turn'd back, catch'd me as fast,</L>
<L>I had the greater harm.</L>
<L>The Justice hearing all was done,</L>
<L>and that they did abuse him,</L>
<L>In order calls them one by one,</L>
<L>so kindly he did use him:</L>
<L>But <HI>Taffy's</HI> tongue could not refrain</L>
<L>was tell her all her mind;</L>
<L>He often cries, was ugly quean,</L>
<L>Cots-plut will beat her blind.</L>
<L>'Twill not prevail, 'tis all in vain,</L>
<L><HI>Taffy</HI> must surely dye,</L>
<L>It was not time to speak again,</L>
<L>great was his villany.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> knows not what to do,</L>
<L>to dye Sentence is given;</L>
<L>Will her believe? was tell her true,</L>
<L>was sure to go to Heaven.</L>
<L>These words did please the people well,</L>
<L>they all were bent to Laughter,</L>
<L>But mark what unto her befel,</L>
<L>the worst of all comes after;</L>
<L>Just like an Image <HI>Taffy</HI> stands,</L>
<L>and dares not move at all,</L>
<PB REF="5"/>
<L>But at the last he wrings his ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds,</L>
<L>and on his knees did fall;</L>
<L>Was pray her Justice, Jesus sake,</L>
<L>not j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge her to be hanged,</L>
<L>Some other sorrows let her take,</L>
<L>her fears not to be banged:</L>
<L>The Justice then to him replies,</L>

<L>but the Justice speaking on</L>
<L>did much increase her sorrow,</L>
<L>Thy hand shall burned be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</L>
<L>yea, almost burned thorow.</L>
<L>This liked not the <HI>Welshman</HI> well,</L>
<L>yet her had rather bide</L>
<L>To see the Suburbs of black <HI>Hell,</HI></L>
<L>than in the town to ride.</L>
<L>Hold up thy hand the hangman said</L>
<L>where I shall thee appoint;</L>
<L>This made poor <HI>Taffie</HI> sore afraid</L>
<L>was wish 'twas out of joint.</L>
<L>The hangman then to him did say,</L>
<L>when I the Iron bring,</L>
<L>Hold thy head another way,</L>

<L>The people all did laugh ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>right</L>

<L>while he did weep as fast,</L>
<L>The hangman put him to a fright,</L>

<L>He tells him he must burn once more</L>
<L>because he did not sing</L>

<L>This one thing grieves her most at last</L>
<L>than all was done before;</L>
<L>Her is not yet gone clearly past,</L>
<L>for there is one thing more.</L>
<L>The Keeper asks him for his Fees,</L>
<L>which vext the Welshman sore,</L>
<L>Her has no score for ought her knew</L>

<L>Was ask her now for Keepers Fees,</L>
<L>her had no chink at all,</L>
<L>Her may not buy no Leeks nor Sheese,</L>

<L>Was pray her Keeper op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n door,</L>

<L>As her was never there before,</L>
<L>will never more come there.</L>
<PB REF="6"/>
<L>The Keeper hearing what he said</L>
<L>was moved unto laughter,</L>
<L>Poor <HI>Taffy</HI> he no longer staid,</L>
<L>take heed (quoth he) hereafter.</L>
<L>Now he hath 'scap'd the Keepers claws,</L>
<L>and hath his freedom won;</L>
<L>His mind is bent to learn the Laws,</L>
<L>and now her hath begun:</L>
<L>Forthwith to the Court he goes with speed</L>
<L>a Lawyers Clark to be,</L>
<L>Yet he could neither write nor read,</L>
<L>O the more is the pity.</L>
<L>Now her was asked what her were,</L>
<L>her was a Shentleman,</L>
<L>And her hath suffer'd many a loss,</L>
<L>thus her complaint began:</L>
<L>But her will rather bide the pain</L>
<L>a Lawyers man to be,</L>
<L>Before her will return again</L>
<L>into her own Country.</L>
<L>Although you know your calling ill,</L>
<L>yet her delights to live</L>
<L>A Servant to your pleasures will,</L>
<L>if her will her believe,</L>
<L>Her never lov'd her bones should work</L>
<L>at any toilsome trade,</L>
<L>But her likes best to be a Clark,</L>
<L>mark well what her hath said:</L>
<L>His Master ask'd him if he had</L>
<L>learn'd Latin Books, or Greek,</L>
<L>What think her was a man was mad,</L>
<PB REF="6"/>
<L>was think her cannot speak:</L>
<L>Was learn'd her A B C 3 times o're,</L>
<L>before her had a Primmer;</L>
<L>And now her had no need of more,</L>
<L>her has enough within her.</L>
<L>Now they did ask if her could read</L>
<L>a Lawyers written scrole,</L>
<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> has nothing to plead,</L>
<L>he cannot read at all:</L>
<L>Kind Reader judge, is this thing true</L>
<L>which <HI>Taffy</HI> hath decreed,</L>
<L>He swears he'l write as well as you</L>
<L>though he could never read.</L>
<L>It was decreed for <HI>Taffy</HI> then</L>
<L>to learn his book apace,</L>
<L>And next day to return again</L>
<L>into the self-same place;</L>
<L>Next day betimes to the place he goes,</L>
<L>from whence he did proceed.</L>
<L>What he hath learned no man knows,</L>
<L>he tells them he can read:</L>
<L>He meets his Master in the Hall</L>
<L>was tell her what was do,</L>
<L>Was write, <HI>God bless us,</HI> on a wall</L>
<L>and her was read it true.</L>
<L>The people then did laugh at him,</L>
<L>was thought her was in Heaven,</L>
<L>Because to read her did begin</L>
<L>the sentence that was written.</L>
<L>God bless me then forthwith he said,</L>
<L>which when the people heard,</L>
<PB REF="7"/>
<L>Said <HI>Taffy</HI> you have falsly pray'd</L>
<L>as by your words appear'd:</L>
<L>Her was not wrong, was tell untrue,</L>
<L>was sure was no mistake,</L>
<L>Pray for her self and not for you,</L>
<L>lest God should her forsake.</L>
<L>'Twas wisely done as I may say</L>
<L>of such a fool as he,</L>
<L>And he must write all the next day</L>
<L>to gain a Lawyers Fee;</L>
<L>Her takes her seat, was bravely plac'd,</L>
<L>the Pen and Ink doth take,</L>
<L>A pattern was before his face</L>
<L>like to like he must make.</L>
<L>And as it happened there did see</L>
<L>his true copy before him,</L>
<L>An Apes Picture was hanging by,</L>
<L>and <HI>Taffy</HI> did adore him.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> thought that was the rule</L>
<L>that he was for to follow,</L>
<L>Behold the wisdom of a Fool</L>
<L>goes far beyond <HI>Appollo:</HI></L>
<L>He makes a form, as I was told.</L>
<L>would make a man to tremble,</L>
<L>And if that I may be so bold</L>
<L>it did himself resemble.</L>
<L><HI>Cors-plut</HI> was Picture fine and brave,</L>
<L>was like her passing well.</L>
<L>Her picture to her Master gave,</L>
<L>see what to him befel:</L>
<L>Sir rah, I told thee thou shouldst make</L>
<PB REF="7"/>
<L>what was before thee written;</L>
<L>Therefore thou must for thy mistake</L>
<L>with many stripes be beaten;</L>
<L><HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s plutter-a-nails,</HI> will serve her so?</L>
<L>will stay with her no longer,</L>
<L>To seek her Fortune her will go</L>
<L>and her away will wander.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> tells me he hath Land</L>
<L>was left to her in <HI>Wales,</HI></L>
<L>And her I possess it out of hand</L>
<L>because her fortune fails;</L>
<L>But then the Master tells him he</L>
<L>would beg his whole Estate,</L>
<L>Because of his simpicitly</L>
<L>a wis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r man should ha't.</L>
<L>But now her sees there is no cause</L>
<L>why her should lose her Land,</L>
<L>For h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r hath learn'd the English Laws,</L>
<L>her wears it in her hand.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> tells them that before</L>
<L>her dearly bought her Learning,</L>
<L>Such pain was make her cry and roar,</L>
<L>whilst her poor hand was burning;</L>
<L>But all in vain it will not do,</L>
<L>they threaten his Estate,</L>
<L>Then he replies the Tevil take you,</L>
<L>such Rogues shall never ha't.</L>
<L>Her Father wise, got her a fool,</L>
<L>as you report of me,</L>
<L>Why may not her with her long tool</L>
<L>beget as wise as he?</L>
<PB REF="8"/>
<L>Her will not lose her own Estate,</L>
<L>indeed was tell her true,</L>
<L>Was sure her has a wiser pate</L>
<L>than give it unto you:</L>
<L>His words prevail against his Foes,</L>
<L>his Land shall not be given</L>
<L>To any that do him oppose.</L>
<L>O then her is in Heaven;</L>
<L>But now her knows not where to go,</L>
<L>nor whither to betake her;</L>
<L>Her has no Friends as her do know,</L>
<L>all people did forsake her;</L>
<L>Though her has Land and Money store,</L>
<L>yet her has no possession,</L>
<L>Therefore in <HI>England</HI> her is poor,</L>
<L>that is her own confession.</L>
<L>Now her was go through thick and thin</L>

<L><HI>Taffy</HI> did kindly take them,</L>

<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> left them, and is fled,</L>

<L>But mark how after <HI>Taffy</HI> sped,</L>

<L>They apprehend his person then</L>

<L>'Twill not repay his Villany,</L>

<L>And bravely he his flesh doth carve,</L>

<L>This vexed <HI>Taffy</HI> to the heart,</L>
<L>will not appeased be,</L>
<L>His Ear-root doth so much smart,</L>

<L>The hangman he then presently</L>
<L>did shake the new-cut ear,</L>
<L>And <HI>Taffy</HI> fell into as wound,</L>
<L>to see her blood lye there.</L>
<L>They brought him water strong and small</L>
<L>to bring his life again,</L>
<L>He rises up before them all,</L>
<L>O <HI>Taffy</HI> was not slain;</L>
<L>And then he goes out of the crew,</L>

<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield doth pass</L>

<L>But the poor man was here (ala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>)</L>

<L>Then to common Butts he goes</L>
<L>to see the Archers aim,</L>
<L>And one of them shot him in the Nose,</L>

<L>And now the Arrow there doth stay</L>
<L>while <HI>Taffy</HI> out doth take it,</L>
<L>If her shoot her here again I say,</L>
<L><HI>Cots-plutter-a-nails</HI> will break it,</L>
<PB REF="9"/>
<L>He kindly gives the Arrow back</L>
<L>unto the man that shot it;</L>
<L>And thus poor <HI>Taffy</HI> goes to wrack,</L>
<L>but he hath not forgot it;</L>
<L>The Archers knowing what he was</L>
<L>could not refrain from laughter,</L>
<L>But <HI>Taffy</HI> I would thee advise,</L>
<L>take heed of them hereafter:</L>
<L>Well; 'tis no time for him to stay,</L>
<L>for he doth victuals need;</L>
<L>He seeks for victuals by the way,</L>
<L>his hunger for to feed.</L>
<L>At length he sees a bed of <HI>Leeks,</HI></L>
<L>as he was passing by,</L>
<L>And how to steal them out he seeks,</L>

<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> boldly enters in</L>

<L>The Dog did bite him by the breeks,</L>
<L>and rend his Coat in twain;</L>
<L>Instead of pulling up more Leeks</L>
<L>he lays them down again:</L>
<L>And as it chanced <HI>Taffy</HI> had</L>
<L>within his poke a Knife;</L>
<L>And presently he drew the blade,</L>
<L>and rob'd the Dog of's life.</L>
<PB REF="10"/>
<L>Then out the good man comes in haste,</L>

<L>The good man askt him who he was,</L>

<L>Her saith was frighted by a Bear,</L>
<L>and so was forced thither:</L>
<L>The old man did search his breeks</L>
<L>his Villany to know,</L>
<L>There he espied a bunch of Leeks,</L>
<L>and would not let him go.</L>
<L>Now he must to the Justice go,</L>
<L>and there he must be try'd,</L>
<L>All which was to increase his woe,</L>

<L>O this was grieve her to the heart,</L>

<L>The Hangman looks for <HI>Taffy</HI>'s ear,</L>
<L>which was cut off before,</L>

<L>Her to the people did consent</L>
<L>to give him some relief,</L>
<L>Their pence a piece on him they spent,</L>
<L>though he was but a Thief.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> thanks the people kind,</L>

<L>The day was come, the Carter stands</L>

<L>Nay, more than this, his leg is hurt,</L>

<L>But afterwards they to him told</L>
<L>that one to him was come,</L>
<L>And in his poke had brought him Gold,</L>
<L>O then her legs could run:</L>

<L>O her laments unto her friend,</L>

<L>But if you read unto the end,</L>
<L>you'll hear of their departing.</L>
<L>They walk together up and down,</L>
<L>to tell each others mind,</L>
<L>His friend gave to him half a Crown,</L>
<L>there's twelve pence more behind:</L>
<L>It is agreed betwixt them both,</L>
<L>that they should spend the shilling,</L>
<L>Then <HI>Taffy</HI> swears a binding Oath,</L>
<L>that he was not unwilling.</L>
<L>It is agreed that they should dine</L>
<L>both at a House together,</L>
<L>They quickly call for bread and wine,</L>
<L>as soon as they came thither.</L>
<L>Each others Health doth now go round,</L>
<L>for they are void of care,</L>
<L>The Wine did <HI>Taffy</HI> quite confound,</L>
<L>for he hath drank his share.</L>
<L>Some words between these friends past,</L>
<L>about their noble blood,</L>
<L>Then up starts <HI>Taffy</HI> all in haste,</L>

<L>This being done, the people came</L>
<L>the reason for to know,</L>
<L>They thought the <HI>Welshman</HI> had been slain</L>
<L>but it was nothing so.</L>
<PB REF="12"/>
<L>His head was broke, as I may say,</L>
<L>which to the heart did grieve him,</L>
<L>It was not well the other day,</L>
<L>if that you will believe him.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> knows not what to do,</L>
<L>but he pays it off with thinking,</L>
<L>It grieves him now I tell you true,</L>
<L>to loose his friend by drinking.</L>
<L>Well, by the Law it is agreed</L>
<L>that <HI>Taffy</HI> must restore</L>
<L>Full three and four-pence for the deed,</L>
<L>to pay the bloody score.</L>
<L>He pays it then with all his heart,</L>
<L>was glad he escaped so,</L>
<L>And he seeks for to depart,</L>
<L>but e're he must go,</L>
<L>His Landlord then to him did say,</L>
<L>pay what thou owest me,</L>
<L>For there is twenty pence to pay,</L>
<L>which I expect of thee.</L>
<L><HI>Cots-plut,</HI> was tell her what was do</L>
<L>as her may clear the score.</L>
<L>Was break her head her tell to you,</L>
<L>and give her five Groats more;</L>

<L>Then hereupon away he goes,</L>
<L>he leaves the score to pay,</L>
<L>But where he is there's no man knows,</L>
<L>for he is fled away.</L>
<PB REF="12"/>
<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI>'s silver all is gone,</L>
<L>there's not a penny left,</L>
<L>And now he travels all alone,</L>
<L>to seek another shift:</L>
<L>Into a tavern then he goes,</L>
<L>to be a Servant there,</L>
<L>Because Canary <HI>Taffy</HI> knows</L>
<L>is better than small beer.</L>
<L>It was agreed for him to go,</L>
<L>a Drawer for to be,</L>
<L>No wages unto him they give,</L>
<L>because he was not free.</L>
<L>Now he is willing for to serve</L>
<L>at any poor condition,</L>
<L>That he might not with hunger starvè,</L>
<L>was glad of that profession.</L>
<L>Yet he is subject unto jeers,</L>
<L>and flouts as I suppose,</L>
<L>Sometimes they tell him of his ears,</L>
<L>and then his cloven nose.</L>
<L>But <HI>Taffy</HI> now I would advise</L>
<L>to bear with him all crosses,</L>
<L>Let him be silent and be wise,</L>
<L>for fear of greater losses.</L>
<L>The next day being <HI>Sunday,</HI> he</L>
<L>must go into the temple,</L>
<L>To hear <HI>English</HI> Divinity,</L>
<L>but he is an ill example.</L>
<L>He takes his place, and it is nigh</L>
<L>unto the Preachers feet:</L>
<L>In little time that he did lye,</L>
<L>he fell fast in a sleep.</L>
<PB REF="13"/>
<L>The Wine did work in <HI>Taffy's</HI> head</L>
<L>and that was all the reason,</L>
<L>So <HI>Taffy</HI> lies as one that's dead,</L>
<L>'twas for a little season.</L>
<L>Awake, awake the Preacher said</L>
<L>unto the people all,</L>
<L>And then poor <HI>Taffy</HI> was afraid</L>
<L>some body did him call.</L>
<L>By and by, the Welshman cries,</L>
<L>did on a sudden start,</L>
<L>And now he wipes his sleepy eyes,</L>
<L>let slip a mighty f—</L>
<L>The people hearing <HI>Taffy</HI>'s voice,</L>
<L>did at it greatly wonder,</L>
<L>But others they did think the Skye</L>
<L>was almost split asunder.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Taffy</HI> to resolve the doubt,</L>
<L>ariseth from the ground,</L>
<L>And when they saw his cloven snout</L>
<L>they knew it was <HI>Taffy</HI>'s sound.</L>
<L>Therefore it was the peoples mind</L>
<L>to drive him out of town,</L>
<L>Each man doth prove to him unkind,</L>
<L>the first man knocks him down.</L>
<L>The boys and girls run after him,</L>
<L>all people doth him chase,</L>
<L>Through the River he must swim,</L>
<L>was in a piteous case.</L>
<L>But <HI>Taffy</HI> wish'd himself in Hell,</L>
<L>for her was sore offended;</L>
<L>And now I wish the Reader well:</L>
<L>for so my story's ended.</L>
