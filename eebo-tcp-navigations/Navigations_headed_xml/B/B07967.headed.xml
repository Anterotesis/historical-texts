<P>There were many assaults made vpon the same by the enemy, and the towne very valiantly defended it selfe, till the enemy in a most furious manner with multitudes ouer-charged them; notwithstanding they still maintained the same for many daies together, till at last the Suburbs were lost, afterwards the Towne held out foure dayes, in which many were lost on both sides, amongst which the Gouernour is supposed to be one, who behaued himselfe most valiantly, and brake through the enemies Pikes, but most vnfortu∣nately he was by the enemy shot with a Musket in the brest, afterwards the Castle was assailed by the enemy, and did hold out for 4. dayes longer, but was forced to yeeld for want of supply of Victuals and other ne∣cessaries.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Brussels</HI> the 4 of September.</HEAD>
<P>Vpon the 29 of August, <HI>Don Gonzales de Cordua</HI> ar∣riued early in the morning with his Army betwixt the Abbey of <HI>Viliers,</HI> and the Lordship of <HI>Tilly,</HI> neere vnto <HI>Flury</HI> in <HI>Walshbrabant,</HI> about foure leagues from hence, Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> is likewise resolutely marcht on, not∣withstanding <HI>Don Corduas</HI> approches, &amp; sent a Trum∣pet vnto him, to know whether hee would fight with him, or grant him free passage. Whereupon <HI>Don Cor∣dua</HI> answered, that hee would stay his passage, and would resist him vnto the last man. Vpon this an∣swere, <HI>Mansfeild</HI> caused our Horse (which were few and weary) first to be assaulted by a 1300 of his Horse, and afterwards with a 1000 of his Horse, and after∣wards with a 1000 more; and last of all compassed them with all his forces, which were ordered as a halfe Moone, and they set so fiercely vpon our, that it see∣med the Enemy had the Victory; and they got at the same instant one of our Pieces, a great deale of our Baggage, besides great store of mony. But afterwards when our Foote succoured our Horse, they set so brauely vpon our enemies, that they droue them back againe, and played with our Ordnance amongst them, so that they had enough to doe to beate themselues through our forces, and are so by strong hand past thorow our Country. Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Brunswick</HI> is shot in his Arme; which because he was infected of a burning cold, is cut afterwards off, the young Duke of <HI>Weyman,</HI> besides diuers Lords, Gentlemen, Captaines,
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>and Commanders are slaine vpon the place, and a∣mongst many prisoners, there is taken a Rhyne-graue. At our side are killd the Spanish Collonell <HI>Don Fran∣cisco de Gueuarra,</HI> besides fiue of his Captaines. The Count of <HI>Isenburg</HI> hath but two Captaines left ser∣uiceable in health, tha other are all slaine or wounded. The enemie hath lost about 2500, and we about 700. Wee haue gotten seuen Cornets, and one Ensigne of the enemies, and the same haue been presented to day to the Infanta. Many wounded souldiers are brought hither, and as many to <HI>Namur,</HI> the greatest part of them being of <HI>Mansfetlds</HI> forces, they are through the com∣mand of our holy and pious Princesse, cured with all care, wherof some are healed, but they die for the most part. When the enemy was past by, <HI>Don Cordua</HI> com∣manded the Collonel <HI>Gauchier</HI> to follow him with the Horse. The next day he incountred with the enemies betwixt Saint <HI>Truyden</HI> and <HI>Turgem,</HI> and slue certaine thousands of them. And because they thought that our forces had strengthened themselues, or that Count <HI>Henry</HI> of the <HI>Berg</HI> was neare at hand, they made al hast to come away, and left both their, and our Baggage behind, and saued themselues by flight.</P>

<P>The commotion raised betwixt the great, will not cease as yet, and it seemes that the new Turkish Em∣peror hath many secret enemies. The Souldiers haue sworne a new, that they wil dine and die with him, and promised to massacre all those that will oppose them∣selues against him.</P>
<P>The Ambassador of <HI>Hungary</HI> was departed frō the same Court at <HI>Constantinople</HI> homeward with the vsu∣all presents for his King.</P>

<P>Although here come dayly diuerse, that haue beene with Count <HI>Man field</HI> in his late Iourney; neuerthe∣lesse, wee cannot vnderstand the certaintie of all that
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>which happened in the same, seeing they differ so much in their Relations: but they agree almost all in this, That not aboue halfe his Campe is come into this Countrey: Not that they haue beene slaine by the Enemie, but that many haue forsaken the Campe through wearinesse, sicknesse, or hunger, seeing there were many which had seene no Bread in the space of tenne dayes. First of all, they were encountred by certaine thousand Boores: but as soone as they had discharged two Field-Pieces vpon them, they retyred, and suffered <HI>Mansfields</HI> Forces to passe. Whereupon they marched on for the space of eight dayes; and fin∣ding no where any meate or drinke, they fired by the way very neere two hundred Villages. And being very wearie, and almost starued they were met by <HI>Don Cor∣dua,</HI> who would stoppe their passage. But seeing that there was no other remedie, they set valiantly vpon his Forces, and beat through the same, and the Enemie o∣pening the passage, they got two Peeces of Ordnance from them. They haue had three or foure Encoun∣ters with the Enemie; in which, on both sides, diuerse were slaine. The Duke of <HI>Brunswickes</HI> Horsemen per∣ceiuing that hee was hurt, fainted, and would haue o∣therwise quite ouerthrowne the Enemies Campe: but neuerthelesse, his Forces haue sustained the greater dammage.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Berghen vp Zome</HI> the 10. of September.</HEAD>
<P>Since my arriuall here, there is little past, worth the writing, although there passeth neuer a day nor night, but they bestow some Bullets one vpon another. The
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>last night there was a great fire in a corner of the Ene∣mies Campe towards <HI>Roosendall;</HI> whereupon three Peeces of Ordnance were discharged. What this be∣tokens, wee cannot tell. <HI>Don Cordua</HI> is two or three dayes agoe arriued with his Forces in <HI>Spinola's</HI> Camp, whereupon the Ordenance of the Towne playes fierce∣ly. It is not onely strange, but likewise incredible, to beleeue, how many sundry and new Workes here are dayly made to defend the Citie; as likewise, what rare Weapons here are inuented to be vsed. When the Enemies assault our Workes, as strange Trushes to knocke the Climbers downe, and Hookes to pierce their Bodyes, and draw them vpon the Walls sudden∣ly. To be briefe, vnlesse God be disposed to punish our sinnes, the Towne hath no reason to feare the Siege. Likewise, to driue the Enemies from thence, there is but small hope, vnlesse their Conuoyes be kept backe, that they may get no Victuals from <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> and then the <HI>Cooke</HI> will make them to retyre.</P>

<P>THe King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> hoping, that by the inter∣cession and intermedling of his Maiestie of <HI>Great Britaine,</HI> an agreement should be made betwixt the Emperour, the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and him; he retyred with his Army out of the <HI>Palatinate:</HI> and pas∣sing through <HI>Alsatia, Strasburg,</HI> and <HI>Lotteringia,</HI> arriued at last at <HI>Sedan,</HI> where hee dismissed the same, staying himselfe by his Vnckle, the Duke of <HI>Bouillon.</HI> Where∣upon the Army being set at libertie, resolued to serue the States of the Vnited Prouinces, and to march thi∣ther through the Prouinces belonging vnto the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> being conducted by Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> and the Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Brunswick.</HI> The <HI>Infanta</HI> hauing notice of this Designe, commanded <HI>Don Cordua</HI> in all haste to come with his Forces out of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> to resist this Army; and caused likewise, to the same pur∣pose, a great number of Boores to be in Armes. Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> perceiuing certaine Boores vpon the way, at his first entry of the Low-Countries, would not med∣dle with them, saying, That it would be no credite for him to fight with Boores. But sone after, wee met with twelue Companies of Boores, which would stop our passage. Whereupon Duke <HI>Christian</HI> commanded a field-Piece with smal Bullets to be discharged against them; whereupon they fled, and retyred into a Wood.
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>And Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> as likewise the Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Brunswick</HI> commanded the Villages thereabouts to be fired; which was also performed. This was ten Leagues from <HI>Gemblours;</HI> where we receiued <HI>Don Cordua's</HI> Let∣ter, declaring, that hee was resolued to fight with vs. Whereupon wee espying afterwards <HI>Don Gonzales</HI> Campe, wee set our Forces in Battell-array. Duke <HI>Christian</HI> assaulted the enemie first with 600. horse: The Count of <HI>Styrum</HI> followed presently with his Regi∣ment; the like did Count <HI>Harman,</HI> and diuerse other Counts and Lords: afterwards Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> the Count of <HI>Ottenburg,</HI> the <HI>Rhinegraue,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Ploech,</HI> euery one with their seueral Regiments came to second the other; as likewise the Regiment of the Duke of <HI>Saxon, Weymar,</HI> and the Landgraue of <HI>Hessen;</HI> and they fell so valiantly vpon the enemie, that they caused him to retire. At the first encounter, the Horse of the ene∣mie fled, whereupon we assaulted his Foot; and Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and Count <HI>Harman,</HI> went to take the Ord∣nance of the enemie: which they did, and caused them twice to be discharged vpon our enemies, hoping that our Foot would haue come on, but did not; so that we were forced afterwards to leaue them againe: Neuer∣thelesse, our two Peeces played vpon the enemies Foot without missing; and their Ordnance did not annoy vs, because it stood too high, and shot ouer our Camp. In the meane time, the Count of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> the Duke <HI>Christian,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Ottenburg</HI> rode about the Army, encouraging the Souldiers to fight valiantly, and did themselues the like; by reason whereof, diuerse Lords and Officers on our side are hurt, but few slaine. Duke <HI>Christian</HI> had on his backe a White Sattin Dou∣blet, and a Blew Feather vpon his head; and hauing his
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>sleeues drawne vp, hee slashed brauely among the ene∣mies with his Sword, but was afterwards hurt with a shot in his Arme. On the enemies side, there are di∣uers Commanders, and a great number of the com∣mon Souldiers slaine, and notwithstanding wee haue lost many, they haue lost more, and (God be praysed) wee haue gotten the victorie.</P>
<P>The Battell being ended, wee were so wearie, that wee could not pursue our victorie, and our Horses could not stand almost any longer vpon their legges; which caused vs to rest for a while, and to refresh our selues: and the Duke being yet in heat, was conducted out of the Campe at the same time by the Count of <HI>Styrum,</HI> and two Gentlemen. But afterwards, wee marching againe in Battell-array were within the space of a League encountred with diuerse Boores, and o∣thers, which would stoppe our passage: but wee set vpon them, and slew foure hundred of the same; the rest wee berest the next Morning of their Apparrell and Armes. And from thence wee went straight on, ta∣king our way towards <HI>Tongeren,</HI> where wee strengthe∣ned our selues a little, and tarryed a while for the Horse and Foot which were behind; and our Horse being well accompanied, marched the same Night within six Leagues of <HI>Breda.</HI></P>
