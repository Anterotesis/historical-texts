<HEAD>More Newes from the <HI>Palatinate, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe history of the <HI>Iewish</HI> captiuitie is so remark∣able, that it affordeth many obseruations to the <HI>Church</HI> of God, and is like the Balme of <HI>Gilead</HI> vnto festring wounds, or curing salues vnto sore eies: For for the times of their <HI>humiliation</HI> they were deri∣ded of all nations, their credit lay like water spilt out of a bowle neuer to bee gathered vp againe; the Heathen had no word for their Temple, but downe with it, downe with it, nor for the wals of the City, but let them be puld to rubbish, the crowne of the Priesthood was tumbled into the durt, and <HI>Nehemi∣ah</HI> with the <HI>Princes</HI> were mocked to scorne, when they attempted to reedifie <HI>Ierusalem</HI> and to recouer their reputation. And hath it not fared thus with <HI>Count Palatine,</HI> whose inuesture with his euer memo∣rable and heroike <HI>Queene</HI> was for the time glorious, and the manner acceptable, till the supportation of his greatnes fell from him, and <HI>Prague</HI> it selfe stoode tottering in her firmnesse, prouing like an <HI>Egyptian</HI> reede not to be trusted vnto, yea the <HI>Princes</HI> of the Vnion were exanimated, and gaue way vnto the vnresistable power (as it seemed) of the aduersarie: then was nothing heard of but the losse of his crown and dignitie, the surprising of his Countrey and in∣heritance, the pursuit of his enemies, the clamors of the <HI>Papists,</HI> the derision of the <HI>Iesuites,</HI> and <HI>Priests,</HI> the exclamation of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> the attempts of <HI>Sax∣ony,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>and <HI>Bauaria,</HI> with all the formidable preparation, that the <HI>Emperour</HI> and house of <HI>Austria</HI> could make against him.</P>
<P>But now comes the comfort and cure, <HI>Ierusalem</HI> is reedified, the people restored, the Temple erected, the wall builded, the <HI>Princes</HI> sent home againe, the Law read, the Sacrifice exalted, the Priesthood mag∣nified, and a worke is done of admiration: for the God of breath and spirits blew gentle calmes vpon the violent heate of their persecutions, and slacked the burnings of their outragious fires: and why may it not be thus with the <HI>Palatinate?</HI> or, if you will, the King of <HI>Bohemias</HI> proceedings? he hath hitherto had <HI>Nemesis in tergo,</HI> and according to the prouerbe eue∣ry place hath beene a <HI>Seians</HI> horse vnto him, for in hope of restitution, and a peaceable ende, hee hath found no rest, but one waue of turbulency following another: <HI>Spinola</HI> and his armie enters on the West: <HI>Bavaria</HI> and his forces comes vpon the East, and the whole Countrey is trampled vpon with the cruell feete of his enemies: but now <HI>Rota fortunae in gyro,</HI> and through Gods mercy the vaile of despaire is ta∣ken away, and a new face of chearefulnes appeares. For the <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> are ashamed of their for∣mer retraction, and some <HI>Catholick Bishops</HI> begin to suspect a further incrochment and tyranny, and so promish faire to set vpright the florishing liberty of their Cities, which can not be done, except the <HI>Pa∣latine</HI> be restored, the warres ended, and strangers kept from vsurping the plenty of their Country.</P>
<P>As for the Bishop of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> brother to the Emperour, Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> hath alreadie abated his
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>strength, and in a maner dismounted him from ri∣ding away with the triumph of preuailing, yea, he hath affrighted <HI>Leopaldus</HI> himselfe, and thrust vp all his enemies into Townes of Garrisons, so that what with the malignity of the time of the yeare, and wea∣ther, and the feare of his Greatnesse, being 30000. strong: here is nothing talkt of, but Treatises of pacificationwith him, and martages for attonement. For the Bishop of <HI>Spires</HI> Country is wholy in his power, except one Fort, and euery place he comes to either compoundeth for his friendship, or associates her selfe vnto him: yea, he is growne so strong, and so well appointed, that there are messages (I dare not name them Embasses) sent vnto him on all sides, namely, from <HI>France, Venice, Hage, Loraine,</HI> and per∣aduenture <HI>England</HI> her selfe, and that worthily too. For if euer <HI>Hanniball</HI> was commended for Discipline, and good order in his confused Army, consisting of so many seuerall Nations, this man hath augmented his reputation for his Martiall gouernment one way, and his noble Spirit, commixed with mansuetude, and commiseration another way: so that his very enemies can lay no imputation vpon him, more then amazement, what course this braue built Barke will take in this turbulent Ocean of defiances, when all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> stand thus watching one ano∣thers proceedings. And thus much for Count <HI>Mans∣feild,</HI> and the King of <HI>Bohemias</HI> hopes to see once a∣gaine the scattered limbs of <HI>Pelops</HI> gathered together and the broken bones of his Fortune well set againe, made strong and stronger, like broken bones indeed, that proue the better for their first fraction, being well cured by a cunning Surgeon.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P>The elder Duke of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> as it should seeme, is not dead: For by reason of the Bishop of <HI>Hauerstaffs</HI> letters, the yonger Duke of <HI>Brunswick</HI> hath played the Souldier all this Winter, and taken in 8. or 9. Townes of the Bishops of <HI>Ments</HI> and <HI>Cullen,</HI> and al∣though since February Count <HI>Harry Vanderbergh</HI> is gone vp against him, since he tooke <HI>Gulick,</HI> and a <HI>Colonell</HI> of <HI>Bauaries,</HI> and another of <HI>Don Gonzales,</HI> be∣ing in all 12000. foot, and 2000. Horse, are likewise marched to intercept his forwardnesse: yet hath he proued very fortunate in his expeditions, and kept his ground in despight of the proudest wrastlers. But we say here, that these two last Colonells named, are retired backe againe, as taking their first iourney vpon a rumor, that there were 8000. English cōming into the Countrey, and hoping of good passage by the Duke of <HI>Brunswicks</HI> meanes, whom these <HI>Baua∣rians</HI> meant to intercept. But this rumor ran her selfe quickly out of breath. For by the first of March, let∣ters of credit came, that not a Drumm was beaten in <HI>England</HI> to such a purpose, whereupon they returned backe againe to their Generalls, for feare of Count <HI>Mansfeilds</HI> comming vpon them, and surprizing them vnawarres.</P>
<P>Whilst Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> thus proceeded, and had his affaires carried in a sweet passage boat of successe, the Protestant Princes loath to be behind hand with him in correspondency, seeing the great ayds which came in, and the many Forces promised, engag'd themselues likewise to his assistance, namely, the Marquesse of <HI>Baben,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Wittenbergh,</HI> the Marquesse of <HI>Aensburch,</HI> and the <HI>Lanssgraue</HI> of <HI>Hess,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>who euery one prepared 10000. men for the Spring, and made tender of their seruice accordingly, so that if performances follow, &amp; this faire shadow of good words haue but an equall body of substance, and a∣uayleable actions, the Summer fields may be filled with an Armie of a 100000. men, which though it sound too harshly in the eares of Souldiers, who know, what 40000. armed men can doe, and seeme ridiculous to Polliticians, who presently demand af∣ter the money to pay them: yet is it certaine, that these Princes &amp; Lords of Countries haue made their tongues pronounce the iudgement, as for the con∣sent of the heart, and the many contingents, which may happen disastrously, these are wrapped vp in the closet house of Heauen, and being <HI>arcana coeli,</HI> it is not for polluted hands to reach at them, no more then for vs to know, whether <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> will goe on, as he hath done, to hold the Emperor play in those quarters, which if he doe, then let equall men iudge (for all there is a report, that there are 8000. men come out of <HI>Italy</HI> to <HI>Leopaldus</HI>) whether the Emperor can be any way so strong, as the Princes, I might better say, his Excellency Count <HI>Mansfeild.</HI> For without controuersie, he is now such a spirit raisd that I beleeue will hardly be coniured downe againe by such forces, as the Emperor can either spare, or prouide so soone. But the Summer is the time that Armies goe into the fields, and so till that time, we will suspend all predictions, and anticipations.</P>
<P>The fast letters from <HI>Vienna</HI> report diuers things, both of the Emperors pretended mariage, and of the Turkes making peace with <HI>Poland;</HI> but especially,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>concerning the contracts with the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> which hath spent most part of the Winter in their Treaties, and is indeed suspected not to haue any good suc∣cesse, because <HI>Bethelem Gabor</HI> will not conclude it without the Emperour of <HI>Turkes</HI> consent, to whom he is Tributary; and the <HI>Turke</HI> will not consent, be∣cause he pretends that the Emperor hath broken with him, and set vpon his friends in his absence, or not kept promise in sending his Embassador to the <HI>Sacraporta,</HI> as hath bin the custome, and so to attend him in his warres. Thus insteed of reconciliation, is he rather threatned, and for any thing we heare, the Prince of <HI>Transiluania</HI> affects the restitution of the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and will prosecute his recouery as farre as he can, or is able. But which way soeuer it chance, <HI>Dulce Bellum inexpertis,</HI> and the warre hath not onely made scarres in the face of this pleasant Countrey, but filled it with wrinckles, which haue taken in so much soile, and durt, and sweat, that I am affrayd the running water of peace will hardly wash it cleane againe in good time, and it will scarce re∣couer her pristinat glory in many yeares. But of all other things most lamentable, the Church of God hath suffered deuastation, and the backes and sides of Religion haue beene lashed with cruell stripes, and the tormentors hand hath gon ouer them and ouer them againe: For <HI>Idolatry</HI> hath made the walls of those Churches weepe, where God hath beene truely worshipped, and not the name of an Image heard in many yeares. The pulpits haue beene trampled in with those obscoene feet, whose masters haue trod vp on the graues of poore deceased <HI>Christians,</HI> and by the
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>name of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> thought them onely worthy to be receptacles for their ordure, making their Chappels a very Stewes: the houses which haue lodged their garrisons, haue been filled with their strumpets, who haue made the hearts of the owners sad againe, with their filthy prostitution, abominable Masses, songs of ribaldry, inuectiues against Christ and his Gospel, and many other fearefull impieties of superstition and blasphemie: yea all places haue beene repleni∣shed like the groues and alrars of the heathen, with mixtures of incense and sacrifice, which I know, stinck worse then the smell of a dung-hill in the no∣strils of our sanctifier, and great God, so that I make no question, he will one day take his owne cause in hand, and deliuer vs from this vsurpation and intru∣sion, so that for this point I end with the Motto,
<Q>Dies dabit, quod dies negat.</Q></P>
<P>I will not dispute neither of the prerogatiue of Conquerors, nor condition of the conquered, of the riches of <HI>Emperours,</HI> nor the power of <HI>Princes,</HI> of the treasure of <HI>Kings,</HI> nor aboundant wealth of <HI>Monarchs</HI> of the necessitie of the Souldiers, who must either liue vpon their prey, salary, or spoyle, or the incon∣ueniences of a garison in a Country ouer-watched with many disastrous accidents. But this I am sure of, that those souldiers which <HI>Spinola</HI> left behind him, are not onely wasted with many malignant circumstances, but wearied and tormented for want of pay and entertainment: Insomuch that <HI>Don Gon∣sales de Cordira</HI> the <HI>Spanish Generall</HI> laid a new impo∣sition vpon that part of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> vnder his iuris∣diction of a 100000 dollers, which amounteth to
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>20000. lib. sterling, whereabout the people were mi∣serably handled: For although they pleaded the de∣uastation of their Countrey, and the many wrestings from them the blessings which God had imparted af¦ter great toile, labour, and endurances: yet nothing serued the turne but present money, and the Cap∣taines had much adoe to pacifie the Souldiers before the taxe was gathered, and the imposition raised.</P>
<P>By this time, it is the midst of February, and there∣fore it is time to tell you, what a hard Winter wee haue had, and what strange sights wee haue seene. The <HI>Palatinate</HI> hath beene subiect to such frost and snow, that the <HI>Rhene</HI> hath beene frozen 7. or 8. weeks together, and since it began to thaw, which was the 5. of February, we haue had drie and close weather, yet faire and srosty mornings: then grew it close and misty againe 2. or 3. dayes, afterwards it waxed warm but not long: then the mornings brought vs small raine till ten of the clocke, but the 14. and 15. were very wet, by reason of which vncertainty of weather many <HI>proiects</HI> were disappointed, and diverse excur∣sions being made, the Souldiers returned without effecting their purposes: yet did <HI>Generall Vere</HI> ouerslip no opportunitie, which either serued to annoy the enemy, or relieue his friends, hee visited the scon∣ces and garisons, &amp; supplied their wants as he could, he made new <HI>ramparts</HI> at <HI>Hidelburg,</HI> leauing therein Sir <HI>Garret Herbert</HI> as I take it with 2. Companies of English: but the maine gouerment was vnder a <HI>dutch Colonell,</HI> he fortified <HI>Franckendale,</HI> and the sconces on the passages, hee watched <HI>Mainhem</HI> and lay therein himselfe: he reveiwed all other places, which stood
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>in neede of his care, and dilligence, and so much for weather, now to our sights and apparitions.</P>
<P>The 5. of this present February, about one of the clock, there appeared very plainly 3. full coloured Raine-bowes, one bending from <HI>south south-east</HI> to∣ward the <HI>north:</HI> the other opposite to it from <HI>south∣west northward,</HI> the third was called <HI>Iris Verticalis,</HI> whose <HI>Center</HI> was the <HI>Sunne</HI> it selfe: there were also 3. more dimmer and not so well coloured, compas∣sing the <HI>Sunne</HI> as it were, but yet of distance some de∣grees: The night following were many flashings of the aire of lightning, and as it hapneth in such cases some there were, that saw armed men fighting, and some that heard the classhings of armour, and some, that sayd plainely these things were not customary, but portended tumultuary convulsions on all sides: I confesse I remembred the Starre 1618. and made a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of many accidents, which haue hapned since, and although wee were not much amazed at these things, because there was no preuenting of that which God had appointed: yet it made vs make this vse, to pray to God to diuert his iudgment from vs, and continue his mercy towards vs, as for coniectu∣ring the worst, which was warre, blood, and trouble, who could not apprehend as much, without whispe∣ring of prophesies, or calculating natiuities, or af∣frighting any fearefull man, when all <HI>Europe</HI> was in Armes, and the <HI>Princes</HI> of the earth stood gasing at one anothers Fortunes.</P>
<P>By this time Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> had sent to <HI>Loraine,</HI> and had likewise answer from the Duke, which some will haue to this purpose, That for his owne part he
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>was willing to giue way for his passage, whether he meant to goe to <HI>Artoies,</HI> or <HI>France:</HI> But the King of <HI>France</HI> would by no means consent thereunto, which whether it were pleasing to his Excellency or no, I will not dispute: this I am sure, that it made his own Souldiers talke at randome, that he meant to diuert the warre from the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and either draw it into <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Flanders.</HI> As for the hope of rendition, he would not medle with other Princes designes, but in a maner he warranted the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> a better recompence then the rendition of his Countrey, or peraduenture the Crowne of <HI>Bohemia</HI> it selfe, where∣upon reciprocall letters haue passed betweene them, and no doubt there shall no enterprise be set on foot, but by direction of a Councell of warre from the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orenge,</HI> and so running to one another with sweet conueiance, Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> shall be (as it were) the Cesterne to entertaine the water comming from these Springs: For although the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> lieth now quiet at the <HI>Hage,</HI> yet no question is his spirit working in o∣ther places, and time will perfect that, which we now imagine is an vnperfect <HI>Chaos</HI> of confusion, and so much for the busines as it hangeth in suspence, and cannot yet make euen the skoales of mischiefe and misfortune, as we prophanely abuse that tearme, and <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>I vnderstand by many messengers, that your <HI>Co∣rantos</HI> in <HI>England</HI> are so translated, and obsequious to the Dutch Coppies, that they neuer mention any exployt of the English, nor vouchsafe to attribute the glory of any enterprise vnto them, as forgetting
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>Captaine <HI>Boroghs,</HI> at the siege of <HI>Franckendale,</HI> and diuers valiant Gentilmen in other places, nay, they scarce mention <HI>Generall Vere</HI> himselfe, who is worthy of all memory, for his constant resolution, and noble courage in these wants &amp; endurances: For although some Polliticians haue giuen it out, that <HI>Spinola</HI> might as well haue run all ouer the Countrey, as doe that he did, yea, taken <HI>Heidelberg</HI> it selfe, if he had kept his Armie together, and therefore that which was left vndon, must be imputed to his commisera∣tion, or peraduenture, directiōs from higher powers: yet will not I giue way to such opinion, but answere plainly and honestly, that by that time the English had fortified the places, and hunted the enemy with set Batalions, it was not so easie to climbe trenches and ramparts, and come ouer the heads of Pikes, or stop the mouthes of Cannons: Witnesse the inter∣ception of <HI>Bauaria</HI> himselfe, who ambitiously swal∣lowing the whole <HI>Palatinate,</HI> as a gift of the Emperor, came forward a pace with proud steps to straddle o∣uer it like a <HI>Colossus,</HI> and thought at once to inuest himselfe with her robe and Coronet: but GOD be thanked, it is yet vndone, and if euer a Prouerbe was verified, we may well say by him;
<Q>Multa cadunt inter Calicem, suprema{que} labra.</Q></P>
<P>But to my first purpose, seeing the Dutch will tell you no Stories of the English, I will tell you one of the Dutch.</P>
<P>Vpon the last of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> when the Frost began to breake, a certaine Dutch Captaine, full of presump∣tuous words, and ostentous braggs, resolued to per∣forme
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>some exployt vpon <HI>Steine</HI> a Castle, which stood in the midst of woods and waters, and for which <HI>Don Gonzalis</HI> first brake the Truce, the 20. of <HI>August</HI> last: whereupon as well acquainted with the passages, and all the secrets of the place, he vndertooke this enter∣prise with a 100. men, and came accordingly thither by foure a clocke in the morning, nor did he this temerariously to the outward show, but had good searches and scout-masters before to vnderstand the strength of the place (besides his owne knowledge of the scituation) the number of the Guard, and the order of the Sentinells, with all other things apper∣taining to a surprise. But see the misfortune! as soone as euer the Sentinell had discharged his Musket, he quickly fell from his resolution, as a man distracted, and very basely cryed out, We are discouered, <HI>A retreat, a retreat;</HI> and when the Souldiers answered a∣gaine, there was yet no danger, nor could be any in the prosecution, he rode in amongst them, and beat them backe most cowardly, as if 10000. enemies had come toward them: yet for all this, when he and his company had thus runne away, at the same time a Dutch Lieutenant, with lesse then fiftie men, surpri∣sed, and cut off the whole Court of Guard in the Sconse before the Castle, tooke many prisoners, and made the rest secure themselues with in the wals, from whence they played apace, but did not hurt aboue one man: but by reason they wanted their <HI>Patars,</HI> and that the Captaine and his company were gone so far off, they could not enter the gates, nor sap the wals, but made a braue Retreat indeed, and came safely to their <HI>Rendezuous.</HI> But the Captaine in stead of ren∣dring
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>an account to my Lord <HI>Generall</HI> of his actions, ran away for shame, and was no more seene in pub∣lique among the Souldiers; yet had the Lieutenant thankes, and a gratuitie, according to the worthines of his deseruing.</P>
<P>This I thought good to set downe as a tast of such bitter pils, we are many times cōstrained to swallow, as either the <HI>Dutch</HI> proue vnruly, or out of suspition of ouer-mastring, cast vp an vntoward account of their owne weaknes: Thus lost we this opportunitie of the lasting frost, considering the place was of im∣portance, and now must be contented: For in open weather the Castle is in a manner impregnable, as standing (as I sayd) in such a fastnesse of wood, and water.</P>
<P>Whiles the affaires of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> cheered our hearts with the expectatiō of good deliuerance from all our troubles, newes came for certaine, that the <HI>Em∣peror</HI> was married, and the <HI>Pope</HI> had sent the <HI>Empresse</HI> an hallowed rose of gold, with other reliques, which shee receiued very graciously at the hands of <HI>Seigneur Perospi</HI> his <HI>Nuntio.</HI></P>
<P>Although the frost and snow was very great, yet it is sayd, that the <HI>Neopolitans,</HI> and other <HI>Italian</HI> souldi∣ers taking advantage of certaine contracts, and arti∣cles betweene the <HI>Grizons,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> garrisons, haue aduentured through the passages, and with the losse of 800. men by the asperity of wether, presented a body of 800. to <HI>Leopaldus,</HI> who thereupon attemp∣ted both to recouer <HI>Elsas Saueren,</HI> and his Countrey, which were spoyled a new for breach of their faith to <HI>Count Mansfeild,</HI> and to send a defiance to his <HI>Excel∣lencie,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>who for all the report of the <HI>Catholicke</HI> great∣nesse, smiled at the <HI>bravado,</HI> as resoluing vpon other maner of busines, then fighting of a battle in a coun∣try where nothing was to be gotten.</P>
<P>About the 15. of February, a great fire hapned at <HI>Landenburgh,</HI> as you goe to <HI>Heidelburgh,</HI> which not onely burnt down the two great gates, but consumed many roomes and chambers, yea diuers souldiers, that had the watch of the Tower, and guard of the place: yet was the mischeife imputed to the watch, and the Country much affrighted came in to com∣plaine to the Gouernour of the offenders.</P>
<P>Report is still busie amongst vs, and to comfort vs in our wants and distresse in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> assureth that all the Countries round about, namely <HI>Spires, Elsos, Strasburgh,</HI> and all the bishopricks in generall, are ready to starue, and haue not sufficient viands for their owne inhabitants, whereupon <HI>Count Mansfield</HI> hath written to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Wittenbergh,</HI> for passage through his country, so that it is supposed, he either intendeth for <HI>Bavaria</HI> or <HI>Vienna,</HI> vnles he play the lap wing, who commonly flieth furthest from her nest, &amp; so may he giue notice of one thing, and yet pretend another.</P>
<P>Much about this time his Excellency <HI>Count Mans∣field</HI> vnderstanding that the <HI>Bavarian Regiment</HI> was vnder the command of <HI>Montaigne,</HI> and lay quartred vpon the <HI>neckar</HI> in the <HI>ampt mosbegg,</HI> sent to the town of <HI>Hagenaw</HI> for a new composition, &amp; so had 30000. Florens by way of a taxe or new leauie: thus doth he both increase and inrich himselfe, yet is not his de∣termination knowne, what he will do with his great
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>armie, more then that (as they say) he writ letters of comfort to <HI>Heidelburg,</HI> and <HI>Generall Vere</HI> at <HI>Mainhem,</HI> whose horse went out the same day vpon an expedi∣tion, and tooke many wagons loaden with prouisi∣on, and diuers prisoners, who were ransomed after the maners of soldiers: they went out to releiue <HI>Lan∣denburgg</HI> and other townes in the enemies possessiō, for they were subiect to hunger and cold, and there perished of the inhabitants very neere 600.</P>
<P>After <HI>Graue Hendrick Van</HI> being with the garrisons of <HI>Gulick,</HI> had passed the <HI>Rhene,</HI> as was supposed, to ioyne with the <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> that were comming into <HI>Hassia:</HI> the Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Bruns∣wick,</HI> stored <HI>Pater borne</HI> and many townes with soul∣diers, and resolued to encounter them, which way so euer they came or went, but as they had done once before, some occasion deuided them all, for they ne∣uer met; but for any thing I heare, they were glad of good shelter in this cold and vnseasonable weather.</P>
<P>There are other things, of which I could write, but I am sure you dare not publish: For such is the nature of rumor, that a little truth begetteth many absurdities, like a Ball of snow, which by often row∣ling groweth bigger and bigger; and therefore I de∣sist at this time, till better occasion present better mat∣ter vnto me, which, I am sure, is now in the wombe, and longeth for a birth and faire deliuerance. The summe of all is, that God (as he hath done) will maintaine the cause of his Church; and Religion (as she hath done) will shew her owne splendor, in despight of clouds and opposition, like the Sunne, that may be a while obscured, but at last openeth the
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>vapours, and commeth like a Bride out of her cham∣ber. As for man, though there is no quarrell so iusti∣fiable as the defence of the Gospel, and propagation of the same, if yet there be mixtures of priuate re∣uenge, enuie, ambition, desire of renowne, couetous∣nesse, and that which we call heroike vallour in the ampliation of territories; it will taint the good cause, like dead flies in boxes of ointments, and God will haue no such mixtures, as collaterall corruption to be shadowed vnder the defence of his Truth: there∣fore I make no question of a recouery in the <HI>Palati∣nate,</HI> because I see apparantly so many good soules and dispositions both grieued at the cessation of the publique Ministry in many places, and vexed againe at the impietie of Papisticall <HI>Priests,</HI> who dare bring the pattern of the Altar of <HI>Damascus</HI> into the temple of God. And as for their obiection, that maintaine, that the Souldiers of Count <HI>Mansfeilds</HI> Armies, and the rest of the Princes, which pretend the defence of the King of BOHEMIA's cause, are either most of them Papists, or of no Religion: and yet forrage, and spoyle the Countries of Catholick Bishops, and such Lords, as know no other but the obedience of the Popes Supremacy. I answer plainly and honest∣ly: What of that? God will bring his purpose this way about: Though <HI>Nabuchadnezzar</HI> be an hypo∣crite, yet for the time shall his Idoll be trampled to dust, and be no more worshipped: Though <HI>Cyrus</HI> be a Heathen, yet God calleth him his seruant, and he shall send the people to re-edifie <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and the vessels of Gold backe againe to adorne the Temple: And though Papists maintaine their absurd opini∣ons,
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>yet shall they be made instruments of Gods glo∣ry, and euen destroy one another, till either they be conuerted, or effectuate that worke, which he set∣teth them about: In which expectation we remaine at this houre, and exhilerate our selues, that the businesse in hand is in so good a forwardnesse.</P>
