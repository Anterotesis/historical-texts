<HEAD>A CONTINVATION OF THE WEEKELY NEWES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Vienna the 7 of August.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Pon the tiding which the Post of <HI>Brussels</HI> brought here of the Treatie which is now in France apppointed; there were here diuers speeches, rumours, and con∣iectures spread abroad of the designes of the King of <HI>France;</HI> and the order which was alrea∣dy giuen before to some Colonels to march towards <HI>Alsatia,</HI> was also againe renued by the Imperiall Councell. And the Colonell <HI>Schauwenberg</HI> who lay with his Regiment at <HI>Eger</HI> vpon the Frontiers of <HI>Bo∣hemia,</HI> marcht presently with it towards <HI>Alsatia,</HI> and there were also yet two other Regiments, and some horse appointed to follow him with all speed they could make.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> hauing conferred at <HI>No∣renberg,</HI> with the Electors of <HI>Mentz</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>they sent the Emperour word of the resolution by them taken; namely, that they desired that a meeting might be appointed, at which the Electors might one∣ly appeare for to treat about some particular points concerning themselues, as to prouide that the Empe∣rour might not any more hereafter dispose of the E∣states and Lands of any Elector, without the consent of the vvhole Colledge: And to consult also, and to conclude, who shall haue right to succeede the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> after his decease in the Electorate, intending to exclude the Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> and his issue for euer.</P>
<P>The Generall meeting which was appointed in <HI>Morauia</HI> is now ended, and the States of the Land haue agreed to pay within the space of sixe moneths 250000 Florins (each of them is worth three shillings Sterling) vpon condition that they of the Countrie shall haue an absolute pardon, and bee discharged of the Souldiers vvhich are in it.</P>
<P>Although the <HI>Basha</HI> of <HI>Buda</HI> hath againe made an inuasion vpon our frontiers, there are neuerthelesse yet many that thinke the Great Seigneur will breake the Peace betwixt the Emperour and him.</P>
<P>The Cossacks haue not as yet receiued the money which is promised vnto them for a part of their pay, and are therefore continuing their excesses and inso∣lencies.</P>
<P>The money is not yet ready which the Archduke <HI>Charles</HI> is to haue to trauell withall.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<HEAD>From Vienna August <HI>14.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It continueth still, that the Turkes hauing made themselues very strong about <HI>Offen,</HI> inuaded <HI>Lowentz,</HI> and did there great hurt both by fire and sword. There is now great doubt made of the Peace betwixt The Emperor and the Great Seigneur: for <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> sent hither an Ambassador with a Letter writ∣ten in the name of the Great Seigneur to him <HI>(Beth∣lem Gabor)</HI> by which he desired to know whether, if occasion should be offered, hee would take part with him, or the Emperor. Whereupon <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> the Prince of <HI>Transiluania,</HI> desireth to know of the Emperor how and in what manner he may assure his owne Estate, and in what fashion he will protect him, what ayd, and how soone he will bee ready to send it vnto him: and protested moreouer, that in case of deniall of such ayd as is required, the Emperor should haue no reason to blame him, if to preserue his lands and subiects he turned to the other side.</P>
<P>The Tartars haue done great hurt in <HI>Polen,</HI> and de∣feated many Polonians: and the King of <HI>Polen</HI> hath sent for the Cossackes which are in these lands, but they will not depart before they be payd. Whereby it appeareth, that it is not true that (as some repor∣ted) the Polonians should haue defeated the Tartars which made the late inuasion in <HI>Polonia.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Vienna Aug. <HI>14.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Bauaria</HI> hauing made at <HI>Nurenberg</HI> his oath (as an Elector) before the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>who is Chancelor of the Empire, the Land-graue of <HI>Darmstadt</HI> was presently sent to the Elector of <HI>Bran∣denberg,</HI> for to learne his mind concerning the resolu∣tions that haue beene taken at <HI>Schlensingen,</HI> which are thought to agree with them of the Elector of <HI>Saxony.</HI> And it is now almost generally beleeued that the en∣deauors which <HI>Monseur Marescot</HI> hath vsed in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> for there establishing of seueral Princes of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> are not likely to take any good effect.</P>
<P>It is here also euen now rumored, that the Regi∣ment of the Colonell <HI>Schauwenbach</HI> is to bee staid at the instance of the Archduke <HI>Leopaldus,</HI> who stands at this time in greater feare of the oppression of the im∣periall Souldiers, then of the threatnings of the French. He resigned lately his Bishopricke of <HI>Pas∣saw</HI> in the fauor of his Brother the Archduke <HI>Charles,</HI> who hath receiued the Deeds of it: and it is held for certaine, that he himselfe is to marry with the widow of the late Duke of <HI>Vrbin.</HI></P>
<P>The dismissing of the Cossacks is not so much de∣ferred for want of money, as by reason of the immi∣nent troubles in the Empire, and the other neighbou∣ring lands. And the Turks euen themselues haue made lately an inuasion as farre as <HI>Lowentz.</HI> And although <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> protesteth that hee hath had no hand in the late stirrings of the Turkes, hauing but few dayes agoe sent an Ambassador to such effect to the Emperor, who is yet here, and hath promised in his name, that he on his side will keepe the Treaty of a∣greement, and desires that the Emperor wil shew him this fauour, that he may send some persons into the
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>Empire to find out a Lady or Princesse fit to match with him. Neuerthelesse, seeing that here are come aduices, that he maketh great warlike preparations, and that it is to bee mistrusted, that vnder colour of friendship and confidence hee will worke new com∣motions, the Emperour to preuent mischiefe, hath sent a Letter to the Pope to desire him that by the in∣terposition of his authority, hee will be pleased to ef∣fect so much, that the King of <HI>France,</HI> the Veneti∣ans, and the Duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> ioyne not their forces with them of the Protestants.</P>
<P>And it is here rumored, that if the Peace bee once broken with <HI>France,</HI> that 8000 or 10000 Cossacks shall bee sent thitherwards to waste and spoile the Country.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Vienna, August <HI>16.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The tiding is confirmed againe of the great war∣like preparations which <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> hath made, ha∣uing mustred after the generall Meeting of <HI>Hungary</HI> was ended 30000 men, many Turkes and Tartars be∣ing amongst them, and all furnished with their armes, and ready to march: He hath likewise 12 great pee∣ces of brasse, besides great store of other ordnance, and (as they say) giues it out that the Emperor hath not kept the Agreement made betwixt them, and that he is therefore not bound to keepe it any longer. The Count of <HI>Thurne</HI> gathereth likewise a strong army, with intention to come into <HI>Silesia.</HI> But his Imperi∣all Maiestie hauing gotten notice of his designe, hath prouided all the frontier places and passages with all
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>manner of necessaries to hinder his intended en∣terprise.</P>
<P>The Cossacks which were going homeward, are againe called backe by a Poste, and there are yet some 12000 other that were vpon the Frontiers of <HI>Silesia,</HI> lately taken in the Emperors seruice to resist <HI>Bethlem Gabor.</HI></P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Monte-Negro</HI> hath likewise gotten order againe to goe againe with his Regiments into <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>They goe here daily on with their pretended re∣formation, and many of the principall Citizens haue already gotten warning that they must within the space of three moneths either forsake the City, or turne to the Catholicke Romane Religion: where∣vpon many of them haue sent already out of this City a great part of their best moueables. There are like∣wise many Schooles of the Protestants shut. And see∣ing that many Iourny-men haue lately vpon those proceedings left the Towne, the handi-crafts men of it stand in great need of them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Vienna, August <HI>22.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Regiments of the Dukes of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Hol∣stein</HI> are to be mustred, and shall thereupon receiue six moneths of their pay.</P>
<P>His Imperiall Maiesty hath lately giuen order for the leauying of 4000 horse, which are to goe into <HI>Germany,</HI> for feare of Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> and his sup∣porters. We haue here tidings that the Lord <HI>Curtz</HI> the Emperours Ambassador is arested by the Tur∣kish
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>Bashw of Offen, who will keepe him vntill such time as the 36000 Rixdallers which the Imperialls tooke a while agoe from the Turkes be restored back againe.</P>
<P>The Lord of <HI>Lambach</HI> writ with a Letter dated at <HI>Cremitz</HI> the 11 of this moneth: That three Bashaws, &amp; diuers other of the chiefest Turks were with great forces come ouer the Riuer of Donaw, and that they hauing done great hurt by robbing and pillaging, had moreouer taken some twenty Villages which are ly∣ing about the townes which stand on the Hils of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and desire likewise to haue all the other, and seeme to haue taken a resolution to surprise <HI>New∣hensel,</HI> from whence they haue already taken great store of beasts and cattell that was in the neighbou∣ring Villages. And seeing that <HI>Bethlem Gaber</HI> hath great correspondencie with the Turkes, there are many townes which the Emperour kept yet on the Mountaines of <HI>Hungary,</HI> that yeelded to <HI>Bethlem Gabor.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon the Lord of <HI>Lambach</HI> hath written to the Emperor, desiring him to send with all speed that be made, great aide both of men and all other maner of prouision.</P>
<P>Although there was lately a resolution taken to dismisse the Cossackes vpon the receiuing of the pay∣ment which is to be made vnto them, there is now giuen order that they shall not depart seeing the Em∣perour standeth now in need of their seruice.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Monte-Negro</HI> is within the space of few dayes to goe towards <HI>Olmits</HI> in <HI>Moravia,</HI> to ga∣ther
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>there an Imperiall army to conduct the same in∣to Hungary.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Prage, August <HI>10.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Within the space of this moneth was there a Bur∣ger of this City, who fired on purpose a house in the new City of <HI>Prage,</HI> and threw himselfe thereupon in∣to the riuer of Moldaw. And happening the 4 of this moneth that some Fisher-men tooke his body, the Magistrate caused it to be quartered by the hangman, who buried it afterwards.</P>
<P>This tenth day of August got the Burgers of the aforementioned new City, warning, or rather insi∣nuation that they had lost their right of Burgership, which they gat some sixe yeares agoe, seeing they would not embrace the Catholike Romane religion, and that the day of Saint <HI>Iames,</HI> which was prefixed vnto them, was already past. Whereupon their traf∣fickes and trades are forbidden to them all, and their shops shut vp, except fiue, the masters of them being turned to the Romane Religion.</P>
<P>In all these three Cities of <HI>Prage</HI> are the Burgers now daily vrged by the Imperiall Commissioners to pay such moneyes are demanded for the generall par∣don which the Emperour hath granted vnto them. And euen within these two dayes, there were about some fifty persons brought as prisoners to the Town∣house, where they gaue to vnderstand, that they had no monies, nor could borrow any, and that they were willing therefore to yeeld their houses and goods. But how they shall speed the time will shew.</P>
<P>To day there was giuen order, that both the pri∣uate
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>and publike schooles of the Protestants should be pulled downe or rather shut vp, and euen at the same time there were patents granted to cause the Protestants to depart.</P>
<P>It is here very confidently reported that the Church of S. <HI>Stephen</HI> which standeth in the new City shall be demolished, besides some 300 houses more to build a Castle there.</P>
<P>The Dutch Church of the Protestants in the small City shall be giuen to some Monckes called Carme∣lites amongst which <HI>Pater Dominicus</HI> who was at the battle before <HI>Prage</HI> shall be one. And there are short∣ly yet some patents to be dispersed to dismisse all such Protestant preachers as tarry yet in some other towns of Bohemia.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Prage, Aug. <HI>17.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The tyding continueth still of the shutting vp of the shops in the new City, and it is generally thought, that the like will likewise bee done in the two other cities of <HI>Prage.</HI></P>
<P>The 13 of this Moneth were here in the City a∣gaine some three houses fired with the losse of one woman besides great store of moueables.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Prage, August <HI>19.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Few dayes past a Poste whom the Archduke <HI>Charles</HI> sent through this City to the Generall the Count of <HI>Monte-Negro,</HI> to giue notice of the great danger that <HI>Silesia</HI> is in by reason of the imminent inuasions of the Turkes and Tartars, and desired him therefore to come with all his forces in <HI>Silesia.</HI></P>
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
<P>But as we vnderstood before, hee had order of his Imperiall Maiestie to goe towards <HI>Morauia,</HI> and <HI>Hun∣gary.</HI> It is certaine that the Regiment of <HI>Lichten∣steyn</HI> is there already ariued; and, as it is rumoured, the Forces which lay about <HI>Eger,</HI> are likewise to goe thi∣therwards.</P>
<P>The seuenteenth of this moneth was here a Prouost of a Regiment, hencht, by reason that he tooke with some horsemen forty thousand Florins which were sent to pay the Regiment of the Count <HI>Colaldo:</HI> the horse escaped with the money, but hee was hencht in his rich apparell within this Citie.</P>
<P>Wee haue tidings out of <HI>Polonia</HI> that the Tartars haue beene a hundred leagues farre in the same Land, wherevnto they could neuer attaine before, since it was a Kingdome: that they did there great hurt, ha∣uing taken great store of Cattle, thirty thousand horse, and aboue twenty thousand Christian soules, which persons they haue presented to <HI>Bethlem Gabor.</HI></P>
<P>We heare now againe that the last Order which the Count of <HI>Schauwenberg</HI> got, is called back againe, and that he with all speed is to go vvith his Regiment to∣wards <HI>Alsatia.</HI></P>
<P>They write out of <HI>Austria,</HI> that <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> hath summoned the fifth man in his Dominions to come in Armes.</P>
<P>There commeth tidings out of <HI>Silesia</HI> that the Cos∣sacks which lay in <HI>Morauia,</HI> haue gathered themselues about <HI>Troppan,</HI> and intrencht there all their forces, doing great hurt to the Country. And it is rumoured, that they are resolued to send the chiefe transgressors
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>amongst themselues into <HI>Polonia</HI> (seeing that they were the occasion of their banishment) vpon hope that they shall obtaine thereby a generall Pardon for the remainder. We vnderstand also likewise that ma∣ny hundreth of them are already without Pasport or leaue gone homewards.</P>
<P>They write out of the vpper <HI>Hungary,</HI> that seeing it hath not rained in <HI>Tartaria,</HI> within the space of two yeares, that there is great want and misery; and that therevpon some 400000 men, women, and children, haue ioyned themselues together, with a resolution to seeke another land. And as they write thence, some of them haue tryed their fortune in <HI>Polonia,</HI> to the great damage of that Kingdome.</P>
<P>We haue heare tidings out of <HI>Austria,</HI> that both ma∣ny horse and foot come to <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> to serue him. Neuerthelesse hee sheweth as yet no actions of hostilitie to the Emperor; and as some report he is to send to <HI>Venice</HI> both the forces which hee hath leauied in <HI>Polonia,</HI> and them which are come to him out of <HI>Germany.</HI> Our Generall the Marquis of <HI>Monte-Negro</HI> is within the space of few dayes to goe towards <HI>Ol∣muts</HI> in <HI>Morauia,</HI> to forme and gather there an Im∣periall Army, to suppresse perhaps as well the insolen∣cie of the Cossacks, as to preuent the inuasion of the <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Tartars:</HI> for it is rumoured that they haue cast an eye vpon <HI>Newehensel,</HI> with an intention to sur∣prise it. And haue already taken thence great store of beasts and cattell.</P>

<P>Besides diuers other cares which are here taken to defend this Citie from the Plague, there are some souldiers sent to the mouth of Tyber where this Ri∣uer runneth into the Sea, to stop all such ships as come out of <HI>Sicilia,</HI> seeing that there dye many of this in∣fection, and especially at <HI>Trapano</HI> and <HI>Palermo,</HI> And they vvhich come thence say that there vvas lastly a great commotion at <HI>Palermo,</HI> vvhich hapned by reason that a Spaniard would not suffer a certaine Ladie to enter into the <HI>Lazaretto.</HI> Where∣vpon some Italians fell foule vvith the Spaniards: In which fray there were some seuen of the Inhabitants and twelue of the Spaniards slaine, and many hurt, for the whole Citie was almost all in Armes, and if the Cardinall of <HI>Doria</HI> had not stayed this tumult by his presence, there would haue beene done a great deale more mischiefe. There are yet some 10000 persons more sicke, and there dye almost a hundred persons euery day.</P>

<P>They write likewise thence, that the <HI>Bashaw</HI> of <HI>Ar∣zirum</HI> is gone with 30000 men towards <HI>Caramania.</HI></P>

<P>We haue here gotten certaine tyding by a Barque that came from <HI>Brasil</HI> of the taking of the Bay which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> tooke by maine force the 10 of May last past, with some 32 ships, out of which they lan∣ded some souldiers behinde a Mountaine, and went thereupon with the ships towards the towne, and got it very fpedily. They made presently thereupon a Proclamation that all the Indians might tary in their Villages without any danger or molestation of them. They went afterwards by land to surprise yet another place, and it is though that if they can get the same, that they will presently be master of all <HI>Brasil.</HI></P>

<P>The last weeke were some Waggons with money sent both to the Marquis <HI>Spinola,</HI> and Count <HI>Henry Vanden-berg,</HI> besides two whole and foure demi Ca∣nons. It is now generally thought that the Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> will now be in earnest, and doe his best ende∣uour
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>to make a great exploit for the preseruation of his reputation, and this is the rather beleeued, seeing that the Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> made his Will before his departure and caused moreouer his Picture to bee drawne according to the life.</P>
<P>The plague beginneth to kindle at <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> and many Burgers of it retire therefore both to this, and other Townes.</P>
<P>They write from <HI>Madril</HI> that there was in the last moneth of Iuly, some falling out betwixt his Excel∣lency <HI>Mons: Lorenzo Noro,</HI> and the Ambassador of the Emperor the Lord <HI>Francis Christopher Keuanhil∣ler,</HI> Count of <HI>Frankenberg,</HI> being both in the Ante∣camera or priuie Chamber of the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> but the matter was presently taken vp by the intermed∣ling of many Knights and Gentlemen that were there present.</P>
<P>Euen the same day was there a French-man of <HI>Rochel</HI> in one of the Churches of <HI>Madrill</HI> named Saint <HI>Philippo,</HI> who tooke at the time of the Eleuati∣on, the Sacrament out of the hands of the Priest and crummeling it in peeces threw it on the ground.</P>
<P>At the same instant was there liknwise a <HI>Spaniard</HI> in the Church of Saint <HI>Barbara</HI> of the same towne, who tooke likewife the Host at the Eleuation out of the hands of the Priest, but when he had kist it, hee lay it againe vpon the Altar without doing an thing else with it. Then they were both presently taken by the Inquisition, which condemned afterwards
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>the French man to be burned as was with great speed done, and sent the <HI>Spaniard</HI> (as a mad man) to <HI>Tole∣do,</HI> to bee kept there in prison during all the dayes of his life. By reason of these strange accidents, were af∣terwards seuerall dai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of fasting and prayer kept in many Cloysters of <HI>Toledo.</HI></P>

<P>They write from <HI>Arnhem</HI> with Letters of the 18. of this moneth, that the 150 Wagons which were sent from <HI>Rees</HI> towards <HI>Huesden</HI> lay there still expecting further order frō the States, or the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>The English which came lately ouer are dayly in seuerall places armed, and when the new apparell shal be made for the common souldiers, it is thought that many Companies of them shall be sent towards <HI>Rees</HI> where the Count <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Nassaw</HI> is.</P>
<P>There were some few dayes agoe about 6000 Boers mustered in the valey, being armed with Ca∣liuers, lope-staues, and harches, to defend the riuer of <HI>Isel</HI> against the freebooters which were vsed to come now and then ouer it. And it is certaine that about <HI>Bronkhorst</HI> where Count <HI>Henry</HI> of the <HI>Berg</HI> crost last winter the same Riuer, the States are raising of a strong sconce.</P>

<P>We haue here gotten tyding from <HI>Nimmegen</HI> that the Count <HI>Henry</HI> of the <HI>Berg,</HI> hauing besieged the 16 of this moneth, the small towne of <HI>Gennep,</HI> beset it with the Regiment of Colonel <HI>Isensburg:</HI> they of the Castle shoot very fiercely vpon the town, and behaue themselues very brauely.</P>

<P>Wee haue here gotten certaine tyding, that the Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> hath besieged <HI>Breda</HI> round about, so that nothing can any more be brought into the town; as likewise how that Count <HI>Henry Vandenberg</HI> is to come with his Army to ayde <HI>Spinola,</HI> who hath now lately sent towards <HI>Lire</HI> for more Ordnance and war∣like prouision which he hath there, but time will shew the issue.</P>

<HEAD>From Winox-bergen in Flanders, the <HI>9</HI> of September.</HEAD>
<P>On last Saturday when I was at <HI>Brussels,</HI> ariued there the Prince of <HI>Polen,</HI> who was met without the towne by all the Lords and Gallants that were there at the same time, besides many Citizens that went in armor vnder their seuerall colours to conduct him to the Ci∣tie,
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>and to honour him the more, the Ordnance was also placed on the wals of the towne, and discharged at his ariuall. Hee hath in his Company 300 braue Noblemen, Knights, and Gentlemen, many of them being Princes, Dukes, Counts, and Barons. Hee is lodged in the Palace of the Infanta, and lyeth in the same quarter in which the Archduke <HI>Albertus</HI> him∣selfe lay when he was aliue.</P>
<P>There hath been already great triumph, mirth and honour showne vnto him. Hee stayeth there but a while, seeing that (as the rumor is spred abroad) hee is to goe towards <HI>Spaine</HI> to wooe the Infanta.</P>
<P><HI>Breda</HI> is besieged round about that nothing can enter but by maine force, the Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> intren∣cheth himselfe very strongly, and his Excellency the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was yet within these 8 dayes at the <HI>Hage,</HI> but had in a readinesse 2000 Wagons, and ma∣ny boats, and it is since rumored, that he is marcht to∣wards <HI>Gorkum</HI> with an Army of 20000 men. But what he intendeth to doe we cannot learne as yet.</P>
<P>On Wednesday last were at <HI>Brussels</HI> yet some new Patents or Commissions granted to leauie some 1000 men of which 1000 are to be Burgonions, and the rest Wallons and Flemmings, or other Low-Country-men.</P>
<P>They of the Castle of <HI>Gennep</HI> hold still out, and de∣fend themselues very brauely and valiantly.</P>
<P>The last Letters which came out of <HI>Spaine,</HI> haue againe confirmed the taking of the Bay called <HI>Todos Los Santos,</HI> which maketh the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to say that all the Saints are become <HI>Geus</HI> or <HI>Protestants.</HI></P>

<P>The King of <HI>Spaine</HI> (as they say here) hath armed at <HI>Lisbon</HI> some 25 Galeons, &amp; other ships, with an in∣tention to send them with some thousands of souldi∣ers to recouer the Bay againe. But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> will be ready for them, in sending another Fleeet to succour the first. But there are many which hold that the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> shall hardly at this instant bee able to get either Mariners or souldiers enough to make such an enterprize.</P>
<P>Two men of Warre chased lately a <HI>Dunkercker</HI> and draue him vpon the sands by <HI>Blanckenberg</HI> not farre from <HI>Ostend,</HI> tooke seuen or eight of the men, and the rest saued thmselues a shoare, and fired the ship thereupon.</P>
