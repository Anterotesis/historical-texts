<HEAD>A SHORT DECLARATION Of the Division, Situation &amp; Qualities of the EARTH.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Beginning did the Everlasting and Almighty God, throug his wis∣dom, create the world out of nothing; and joyne the Earth with the Sea to∣gether (as being the heaviest) in one round forme, in the manner of a ball, and place them in the center or midst point, as in the nethermost place; the heaven, as a tent, is with an unmeasu∣rable breadth extendeed, over and about it, and adorned with many and glorious lights, as the Sunne, Moone, Planets and other Starres innumerable. And that the earth might be a fit habitation or dwelling for man and other terrestrial creatures, and through its plentiful fruit nourish and sustaine them, hath God exalted it above the waters, and ordained unto the Zea its place in the depths on such a manner, that shee on every side comprehending the earth with its krookednes, doth di∣stinguisch and divide the same in three several parts or great continents, that is firm lands, over which the describers of the earth (as the Astronomers over heaven) place fif circkels, as the Aequinoctial, so called, because night and day are over the whole earth off one length whensoever the Son doth come in this circkel, which happeneth about the 21<SUP>th.</SUP> of March, and the 23<SUP>th.</SUP> of September. This circkel is also called Aequator, to which when the Sunne commeth, it maketh the dayes &amp; the nights equal; the Marriners of the lowe countreys doe call it the middel-line, because it doth divide the face of the earth in two equal parts, whereof one tendeth towards the North, and the other towards the South, &amp; so it is the very middle be∣twixt the Northern and Southern lines or Poles. The other is called Tropicus Cancri, or the Sunne turning of the Crab, be∣cause the Sunne when it commeth to this cirkel about the 21<SUP>th.</SUP> of June, beginneth to turne towards the Aequator, and then it is the longest day to those who live in the north, and the shortest to those who live in the South from the Aequator: this circkels situated 23 degrees 31½ minutes Northward from the middel∣line. The third is tearmed Tropicus Capricorni, or a Sunne-turning of the signe in the heaven, called Capricorne, because the Sunne, when it comme to this circkel, which is about the 22<SUP>th.</SUP> of December, beginneth to turne and to klimbe towards the Aequator; and then it is contrary as before, the shortest day to those who live in the North, and the longest to those who live in the South of the mid-line: and this signe is situated 23 degrees, 31½ minuits in the South of the Aequinoctial. The 4<SUP>th.</SUP> is called Circulus Arcticus, the Northern cirkel, &amp; the 5<SUP>th.</SUP> Cir∣culis Antarcticus, the Soutrhern cirkel: these are situated 23 de∣grees 31½ minutes, the one from the Northern, and the other from the Southern pole or diameter of the world, and are through the circumrotation of the heaven, described from the Pole of the Zodiak, or the course of the Sunne. The ancient &amp; most skilful Astronomers understand by the Circulus Arcti∣cus not onely this which is described; but such a circkel whose half Diameter or line which goeth through the midle point, is even as much as the heyght of the pole from every place, com∣prehending alwayes those starres which before the heyght of every land never goe under, in which regard this circkel in all countreys which differ in breath, doth differ, as also from An∣tarcticus: but in the aforesayd description wee follow the com∣mon manner off the describers off countreys. The earth is also through the aforenamed 4 last circkels, divided in 5 great re∣gions, by the Grieck called Zonas, or girdels, because that they in the form of girdels doe compasse the globe of the earth. The first thereof is environed or enclosed within the Northern circ∣kel, and beareth the name of the Northern colde region. The second is called the Southern colde region, running round a∣bout the Southern Pole within the Southern circkel. The third, being the middelmost amongst them all, is called the barren and hot region, and is situated betweene two Circkels of the Cancer or Crab, &amp; the signe of Capricornus. The 4<SUP>th.</SUP> is situated betwixt the Northern Circkel and the Circkel of the Crab, and is called the tempered Norther Region. The last called the Southerne temperate region, is situated betwixt the Circkel of Capricornus and the Southerne Circkel. The olde Philosophers and Describers of countreys did suppose that off these few the two temperate alone where inhabited, and that of the other three, the two colde ones colde not be inhabited, in regard of the great intolerable colde, &amp; the barren hot region, in regard of the burning heat of the Sunne. But time in con∣clusion hath produced, the truth thereof: seing we have ex∣perienced about 150 jears hence that they all are inhabited, but the colde least of all, as Greenland, Ysland, Lapland, the utmost parts of Norway, and such like countreys. Experience likewise hath taught us that in the barnen, hot region the heat is not untolerable, neither doth it burne in such a manner as the Ancient conceived: fith there are found many excellent fruit∣full and populous Kingdomes, as Gennee, Aethiope, Arabien, East-Indies, the famous Ilands Sumatra, Java and Molucquen, as also Bresilien, Peru, Nieuw-Spaine, and other such like countreys.</P>
<P>For to have the right understanding of the situation of coun∣treys, wee must knowe that the describers of the earth calcu∣late the same according to the degrees of length and breath. The breath of places (which is alwayes a like at the height of the Pole) is accounted from the midle line to be twofold, Northward or Southward to the number of ninety. The length is accounted from the Meridian-line, which runneth over the Pico de Tayda in the Iland Teneriffa, along de midle-line to∣wards the East, to the number of 360, as for example, Am∣sterdam is situated 52½ from the midle-line towards the North, which is the breadth or the Poles heigth of the same city, and in the length 23 degrees, because the same doth agree with such a degree of the Aequinoctial, calculating from the afore∣sayd Meridian. De Cabo de Bona Esperanca is situated on the breadth Southward from 34½ degrees, and in the length from 42 degrees. The countreys or cities situated under the same length, have alwayes at one time and moment alike midday, and alike houre of the day: as when it is noonetide at Amster∣dam, then it is also noonetide at Bergen in Norway, at Lions in France, at Algiers in Barbary, and such like places situated in one length. But those which are situated under severall degrees of length, differ likewise in the calculation of houres; so that when it is midday in the forenamed places, then it is a Bantam in the Iland Java 7 houres and 12 minutes in the afternoone, because the same city is situated 108 degrees in the length to∣wards the East, for it differs every 15 degrees one houre; but in the city Lima, lying in Peru, it is 6 houres in the fore-noone, because the same city is situated in the length about 90 degrees towards the West, as Amsterdam. Those also which are si∣tuated under the like breadth or heigth of the Pole, have al∣wayes alike length of dayes and nights: this is also to be under∣stood, that those who live on the southside of the midle-line, have the shortest day, when we have the longest: as they have the Winter when we have the Sommer, and we the Winter, when they have the Sommer. But they which are situated un∣der an unequal breadth or heigth of the Pole, have also une∣qual length of dayes and nights: for the farter a place is situated from the midle-line, how the longest day is greater there, and the shortest les. As for example they wol live under the Aequi∣noctial line, have day and nigt thorough the whole jeare alike long, without change. They who live on the breath of 30 de∣grees, have the longest day almost of 14 houres: on the breath of 50 degrees, the longest day hath stifly 16 houres. Under the Northern Circkel, which wee call Circules Arcticus, doth not the Sunne on the longest day, set or goe under the Horizon. On the breadth of 70 degrees doth not the Sunne set in 64 dayes: and so following the longed dayes encreasse till under the Pole, wherein the whole jear not more is then one day and one night, each continuing one half jeare.</P>

<P>Further more the Earth is divided ad this day in two great firm lands and parts, in <HI>Antiquam</HI> or olde and <HI>Novam</HI> or new America, called the new Worlde. The first called the olde Worlde, because it was onely knowne to the Ancient, have the ancient Describers of the Earth divided againe in tree parts to wit, in <HI>Europa, Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>EUROPA as some wil have it, hath its name from the Dochter of Agen, or King of Syrien, ravished by Jupiter, which others esteeme to be fabulous, supposing that the Ori∣ginall of this name is unkowne. The territories of Europe in the West are the great Zea, in the south the Mediterranean Zea, in the East the Archipelage, Pontus Euxinus, or Maeotis Palus, and the right line ascending thither wards the Nord to the River Dwyna, from whence the Ys-Sea doth washe against Europe. Albeit this part of the Worlde be very small in respect, of the other parts of the Earth, yet not with standing it is com∣mended above all other Countreys for its singular vertuet, &amp; specially for the wholesom and temperate ayr, the fruytfulnes of the Earth, &amp; abundance of all other necessaries for the main∣tenance of Mans-life; being watered with many fayre Rivers, and furnished with many hot and colde water-veynes or ba∣things, effectual and fit for the expelling of severall diseases. Here grow no drugs not precious stones, but abundance of Korne, Wine and als sort of fayr tree-fruyt. Here are few cruel and pernitious beasts, but tame Creatures in a greater multitude and fayret then one where. Thoug that which this Countrey doth most boast of, is the great multitude of its fayre, welbuilt &amp; populous cityes, which are here farre more in number, then in other parts of the earth. Europe hat formerly through the Monarchy of the Grecians and Romans, ruled as a Queene over the Countreys of Asia &amp; Africa: al shee yet doth at this day through the Moscoviters and Turckes, as also throug the Castilianen, Portugals and Hollanders, who have dominion over many places, countreys, Ilands, and potent Cities the∣rein conteyned, and who doe subdue under theyr obedience almost whole America.</P>
<P>SPAYNE is the Western, &amp; therefore also the first King∣dom of Europe, of their inhabitans called Espanna, within name as also the People have theyr denomination and deriva∣tion of certayn Province in Asia, in former time called Pania, of pan who was Lord of the same. Spain is on all the 4 parts or side environed with the Zea, except on the North-east-korner which is compassed about with the Pyrenian hils, for a separation from Frans. 't Is a wonderful blessed countrey, not onely in respect of fruytful ground, but also of an healthy ay∣re; thence it is that there is so faire a growth of Oyle, Sugar, Figs, Raisons, Oranges, Lemmons, Citrons, Pomegranats, Kappers, and other medicinal hearps; and above all such strong and delicate sorte of Wine as any where are to be had. The worldly governement of Spayne consisteth in a King, never∣theles he doth not conclude of any nomentany affairs without the advise of the 12, who one with an other make up the high Counsel. The Ecclesiastical governement consisteth in Arch-Bishops and Bishop; the first are ten in number, the other more then vifty. Spain in our time is gotten under one King, which was never sien before in 800 yeares, notwithstanding conteyningh 16 several Kingdoms as may be seene in the Spanish Titels: but Castilien or Castilie, Arragon and Portu∣gal are the chiefest, under which all the other resort.</P>
<P>ARRAGON hath its denomination from the Province Tarroconensis, in which it is situated, or from the city Tarragona. Its head or Mother-city is Saragossa, in former time called Caesar Augusta, placed on the river Ebro. In the midst of this Kingdome is Monson founded, wether the King once in three year doth resort in his owne Person, for the receyving of his revenues.</P>
<P>The third krowne of Spayne conteyneth the Kingdoms of Portugal and Algarven; Portugal is last of all joyned unto the other Spanish Kingdoms. 't Is supposed that the revenues of the Kingdom import jearly two Millions of Ducats, which wealth doth most arise from the great trade which the Portu∣gals drive upon Ginee, Brasil, and Portugals Indien; but the countrey is also fruytfull in it self, affording many sortes of Wine, Oly, and other commodities. The mayne City of Portugal is Lisbon, situated on the River of Tajo, an excel∣lent and great city of Marchandise.</P>
<P>FRANCE, the noblest fruytfulst and most potent King∣dome of Europe, hath its name from the Frankes, a people of Germany, which 1200 years hence begin to conquer it. For the environing of this Kingdom is drawn in the North a line from Calis to the freedom of Straetsburgh; which line they of Artois, Henegou and Lutzenburg doe let lye on the left hand. In the West Frans doth beath on the Sea of Aquitanien, nou Gujenne, and partly on the Pyrrhenian hils, which fasten and joyne it to Spayn, in the South is bordereth on the Mediterra∣nean Sea; in the East the high hils (called the Alpes) divide it from Italy, the hil Jura from Helvetia or Switserland, and the River Rheine from Germany. This countrey hath abundance of wheat and all other sorts of Korne, of Wine wee find here many sorts, and in such abundance, that it doth not onely supply it self therewith, but also Engeland, Schotland, the Lowe Con∣treys, and many other places besides, in the Southern parts of France is plenty of Oyle, Figs, Safferon there is ordinarely much kattel; wee finde there much Salt, Flax and Hemp. In this Kingdome are 14 Arch-Bisshops, and above hundret Bisshops. It is divided in 8 Parlaments or high Courts, to which the 21 head-Provinces there in conteyned, appeale. The same Par∣lamens have their residence in the cities of Paris, Rouaan, Ren∣nes, Bordeaux, Tholouse, Grenoble, Aix, and Digion. In our time hath King Henry the Great of an immortal memory joy∣ned his souveran Prinsdom of Bearn to the Krown, and there erected a ninth Parlament in the city of Pau.</P>
<P>ITALY, which many account for the fayrest countrey in the World, shold have obtayned its name from the King Italus of Sicily, who first taught the Inhabitans husbandry. The Territories of Italy in the West are, &amp; partly also in the North, the Alpes with the flood Varo, which divide this Country from Frans, Germany and Switserland: forth thence forth the Sea washeth round about it. The hil Apenius is as the back∣bone of Italy, dividing the same in length allmost over thwart from the hils of Alpes to the Sea of Sicily. Italy hath for the most part a healthy and good temperate ayr, the ground is wonderful fat and fruitful, affording plenty off Korne, fruite, &amp; all sorts off hearbs, several excellent good Wines, Oyl &amp; Flax, the fields are ful off tame, and the woods ful off wild creatures, the hils adorned througly with several Metals and stones. Here are found many waters replenished with fish, many glorious and neatly-built and strong cities, in one nord, this country is the right Paradijs off World. In Italy are 28 Arsh-Bisshops and more then 200 Bisshops; with many beautiful cities, off which these are the chiefest: Rome, Napels, Florence, Ve∣nice, Genua, Milanen, Bolonien, Ravenna, Cremona, Pavia, Paedoa, Verona, Vicenza, Mantoua, Siena, Luca, Ancona and Livorne are the two chiefest havens. Messina and Palermo lye in Sicily. The Ilands of Sicily are specially three; Sicily, Cor∣sica and Sardinien; besides other little ones.</P>
<P>GERMANY, the greatest Countrey off one name and Language in whole Europe, the Latinists call it Ger∣mania, the inhabitans themselves call it <HI>Teutschlandt</HI> / the reason hereof is uncertaine. The linits off Garmany doe at this day stretch much further then in the dayes off Prolomy, for in the West is passeth through the Rhine, and beateth at the French Lands of Loreyn and Bourgondien; in the South, it stretchest over the River Donau to the hils the Alpes, which divide it from Italy; in the East it bordereth on Prussia, Po∣land, and Hungary, in the North on the North-zea, Den∣marck, and the East-zea. 't Is a warlik Nation and a populous Countrey, no lesse pleasant then fruitful; it hath a sweet Plea∣sant ayr, and plenty of Wines, which produce delicate good Wines. The Woods and Fields are replenished with wilde and tame Beasts, the Rivers and other Waters rich off Visch: Here are found very faire Fountaines, and healthy baths; many of Iron, Steele, Kopper, Tinne, Gold and Silver. Germany is divided in the high and lowe Countreys. The high Coun∣treys are called those places which lye next to the Alpes, and conteyne those following Provinces: Elsaz, Swaben, the County of the Pals on the Rhine, the Kingdome off Bohe∣men, which, though the inhabitans thereof use another lan∣guage, noth wichstanding is comprehended within Germany and hath under it three Provinces; to wit, Marhern, Silesien and Lausnits. The County Tirol, Stiermarck, Carnten, and Carniola or Crayn. The Low-Countreys comprehend the Bisshopricks off Ments, Trier and Coln, the County off Hes∣sen, the Dukedoms off Saxen, Pomeren, Mekelenburgh, Meyssen, Thuringen, Cleeff and Bergh, with the Countreys which doe depend on them. Under the Marquesse off Bran∣denburg resort Westphalen &amp; the Dukedom of East-Frieslant.</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>THe LOW-COUNTREYS, which in time off the Romans most were conteyned in <HI>Gallia-Belgica,</HI> are at this day divided in 17 Provinces, bordering in the West and South on Frances, in the East on the Rhine or the Maas, in the North on the Ocean. The ayre off these Countreys is thick and moist, but healthy and convenient; the ground for the most part even and smooth. The Low-Countres are very fruit∣ful off Korne, and several sortes off tre-fruyt; they afforde also much Flax, Hemp; there is also much catle to be found: but the chief of the countrey consisteth in fishing and navigation, whe∣rein the inhabitants surpasse all other Nations. These 17 Pro∣vinces are partly subject under the House off Bourgundien, partly free, and are governed in the manner of a comonon∣weath. The House of Bourgundien possesseth the Dukedoms off Brabant, Limburg, and Lutzenburg, and one Quartier off Gelderland, the Marquizdom off the Holy Empire on the Ri∣ver Schelde, the Earldoms off Flandres, Artois, Henegou, Namen, and the Dominion off Mechelen. The free united Low-Countrey Provinces are these: three quarters of the Du∣kedom Gelderland, and the Earldom Sutphen, the Earldoms off Holland and Zeland, and the great Dominions off Utrick, Friesland, Overyssel, and Groeningen.</P>
<P>HELVETIA or SWITSERLAND borders in the South, on Italy; in the East on the Earldom on Tirol; in the West, on Savoyen and Bourgondien; in the North, on Eisaz and Loreynen. It is a countrey which lieth in the midst off the Alpes, and therefore accounted the highest Countrey off Europe, indifferent good and fruytful; free and respected off all its neyghbours, divided in several Cantons, which the call Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en. The chief cityes are Zurich, Bern, Lucern, Basel, Friburg, Baden.</P>
<P>The Earldom off Walles, where of Sitten is the prime city, &amp; the Province off the Grisons or Graubunders, having Chur for a capital City, have bin long since in consederacy with the Swit∣sers, and defend one another against theyr common enemies.</P>
<P>POLAND borders towards the East on Silesien; hath for her Neygbours the Prussiaus, Littauwers, and Hungarians; it is a very fruytful Countrey off all sorts off Korne. The chief city is Cracou, situated on the Weixel. Not farre from thence are mines off Salt. The chief commodities which are transpor∣ted out off Poland in other countreys, are, Wheat, Rie, Flax, Wax, Wood and Lead.</P>
<P>DENMARKE is an indifferent great and large King∣dom, on a wonderful manner parted and divided throug the sea. Its extremest Province is Jutland, in former time called Cimbrica Chersonnesus. This countrey bordereth in the South an Germany, being forthwith environed with the sea, for the most part it is fruytful and rich off Korne, except in the North, where it is sandy and barren. Out of Denmark are conveighed to other parts multitude of Oxen and Horses, much Butter, Hides, Visch, &amp;c. The chief city is Coppenhaven, where the King deepes his court, and where there is an University.</P>
<P>NORWAY hath on the East Sweveland, on the West the Ocean, on the South Denmarke, and on the North Lapland. The West and South Quarters of the Countrey are of an indifferent temperate Climate, but on the North the soile is unfruytful, and not able to feed and supports its habitans. Out of Norway cometh plenty of Stok-visch, great quantity of pelt, hides, trane, tarre, masts, spars, plankes, &amp; other sort of wood.</P>
<P>SWEDEN or SWETHELAND boundeth in the West on Norway, in the South on Denmarke; in the East on the white Sea and Moscovia; in the North on the Ys-Sea. This Kingdom is one of the fruitfulst Quarters of the North, &amp; affordeth much Korne, Hony, Wax, Pelts, Hides, Roer, Silver, Steele, Lead, Iron and Kopper. The head or chief city of the Kingdom is Stokholm, where the King keeps his Court.</P>
<P>MOSCOVIA hath towards the North the Sea Petzor∣ke, towards the East the Tartarians; towards the South the Turks; &amp; towards the West, the Littauwers, Lijflanders, and the Swethers. The chief city is Moscou, there the great Du∣ke (whone the Subjects call the Emperour of Russia) keepeth his Court. The principall commodites which are from hence transported unito other Countreys, are Flax, Hemp, Wax, Eland &amp; Oxen-hides, severall precious pelts, traan &amp; salt visch.</P>
<P>LIFELAND bordereth in the East on white Russenland of Moscovia; in the South on Samogitien, which is a part of Litta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; in the West and North on the East-Sea. The chie∣fest city is Rigs, not farre from the mouth of the River Dwyna. Ith affordeth much hony, Wax, Asshes, Pick, Taar, and Pelts.</P>
<P>HUNGARY hath for her Neygbours on the East Moldavia; and Walachia; on the South Bosnia and Croatia, towards the West Austria or Ostenreich, and towards the North, Poland. The ground is exceeding fruytful of Korn, Wine, and all sort of Victuall, of kattel here is such great plenty as that the sheep and Oxen are sent in abundance to Germany and Italy. Here also are found many Mines of Gold, Silver, Kopper, Iron and Steele.</P>
<P>SLAVONIEN is environed betwixt Hungary, Italy, the Gulf of Venice and Grece: containing Liburnia, Croa∣tia, Bosnia and Dalmatia. The Turke hath a great part thereof in possession, another part the Emperour of Germany, the rest being situated on the Zea, is under the dominion of the Ve∣netians.</P>
<P>GREECE, in former time a Mother and Nurse of all sort of learning, but now a bondslaaf of the unbeleeving Ma∣humetists, and an habitation of the Turkish Emperous, is en∣vironed on the North with Bulgaria and Servia; and forth with on the West, South and East compassed about with the Sea. The commodities which are brought out of Greece and con∣veyghed to forreine places, are, gold, silver, kopper, kopperas, sevral dying stuffe, wines, oyl, flus, Damasts, &amp; Turksch Grog∣greins. Greece or Grieckland hath allmost innumerable Ilands, among which the greast and most famous, is, Candia, in for∣mer time called Creta, affording very precious and delicate Wines, Moscadel and Malvesii, Curtens, Scarletdie, Sugar, Cristal, goat-skins, Oyl, Hony, Wax, and healing hearbs.</P>
<P>The chiefest Ilands of Europe, situated in the great Sea, are, Brittaine, Yreland and Ysland, Brittaine (which certaine yeares hence is happily reduced under one Kingdom) was here to fo∣re divided in Engeland and Scotland.</P>
<P>ENGLAND which with Scotland maketh the greatest Iland of Europe, bearing abundance of good wheat and other sort of Korn, and beautified with many rivers wherein is plenty of fish, hath many commodious havens: also mines of Gold, Silver, Lead, Iron, and especially much precious Tinne: There are several sortes of creatures, (serving for the suppor∣tance of Man) and chiefly a great multitude of fine Wol-bea∣ring sheepe, which indeed is the right golden fleece of this Ro∣yal Iland. The chief city of whole Engeland is the glorious city London, situated on the River Teems, with a bridge over it, which is accounted one of the fayrest of Europe. From hence come several sorts of Wollen clothes, Saffron, Tinne, Lead, Wheat, Baarly, Beat, Dried herrings, and Sea-koles.</P>
<P>SCOTLAND compassed round about with the Sea, except on the South where it boundeth on Engeland, is not so fruytful, hath notwitstanding all necessaries for the sup∣portance of life. The chief city is Edenbourrough. Scotland affordeth many sortes of course Wollen clothes: Wool, Malt, Hides, Fish and Stone-Koles.</P>
<P>YERLAND is ful of lakes &amp; standing Pooles, hath good fat pastorage, also abundance of tame and wilde Beasts. This Iland hath an healthy ayre, beareth no venomousthing. The inhabitants are rude wilde People but through the con∣versation &amp; governement of the English begin to be more &amp; more tamed. On the fields grow much gras, where in goe ma∣ny kie &amp; sheep, but are somwhat lesse then in other countreys.</P>
<P>YZLAND is in length about hondert dutsch miles, for the most part unbuylt and hilly, in the valleys is much katle and gras, there groweth no Korne or other trees then bark and Junipertrees. The inhabitans make bread of beaten fish, wont to drinke water, but mixe it now with Korne, which is brought to them from forreyne places. They live most, in caves or holes under the earth, and account the Mountaines for theyr cities, make theyr houses of fish-bones. They in the East-countrey deale much for Ysland, and exchange ther com∣modities for brimstone, dry Fish, Roet, Butter, Skins of wilde and tame Beasts, white Faulkes, Horses, and other commodi∣ties. In this Countrey are two Bisshopricks, Holen and Schal∣holt, which have some Nunneries under them. Here as also in other Northern parts are found many white Beares, which are exceeding fierce and cruel.</P>
<P>ASIA the second part of the olde World, is in the West divided from Europe throug the Rivers the Don and the Dwina; from Africk throug the narrownes, betweene the Me∣diterranean and the red Seas; on the East it stretcheth to the Chineesch or Eoisch, on the North to the Scytish, and on the South to the Indiaen Sea. It doth farre surpasse Europe and Africk, as also other parts of the World, in largenes, riches,
<PB REF="6"/> plenty of spices, precious stones, kostly Pearles, and other rarities. This part of the world hath bin in all former times the most famous; for from hence arose first all dominions, where by the world hath bin governed. Man hath bin there first crea∣ted of God, placed in Paradijs, seduced throug Satan, and re∣deemed throug Christ our Saviour. Here also hapned most all that hapned in the olde, &amp; especialy that in the new Testament.</P>
<P>All the Countreys of Asia are divided in six parts: where of the great Duke of Muscovien doth possesse a part; the second is under the Tyranny of the great Turk; the third under the Power of Tartarians; 4<SUP>th.</SUP> under the Dominion of the mighty King of China; the 5<SUP>th.</SUP> are the rich Countreys of Indien, and the 6<SUP>th.</SUP> and last part is under the command of the Sophi, or King Persien. To Asia likewise appertaine an innumerable mul∣titude of Ilands, among which these are the chiefest, Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea, furthermore in the Indian Sea, Zeil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, Moluccen, Banda, Gilolo, Luconia and Japan.</P>
<P>Of Muscovia wee have treated here to fore in the Description of Europe, sith the most part thereof is situated in Europe.</P>
<P>That which the great Turk doth possesse in Asia, are all the Provinces of Natolia (formerly called Asia the lesse) small Ar∣menia, and a part of a great Armenia; Diarbech (in former time Mesopotamia) Syria and a great deal of Arabia. The chiefest Mart-townes in these Countreys are, Trapesonda, Aleppo, with the Sea-havens Tripoli, Amon, Damasco, Baruti and Mecha. These Countrey affoard much silk, Tasti, Damasts, Turks Groggrein, Kotton and Scarletdie. The other part of Arabia resorteth under severall Kings, there in is situated the famous city Aden: from thence come very fayre Pearles; the unfeygned Balzem-Oyl, Franckincense, Myrrhe, and such∣like commodities.</P>
<P>TARTARIE are in one name tearmed all the Coun∣treys, situated, with a large and confused comprehension, Eastward from the Eastern Ocean, betwixt the Northern Yz-Sea and the Southern Countreys, as China, that part of In∣dien without Ganges, the River Oxus, the Caspian and Meo∣tian Sea to Moscovien westward. The inhabitans are called Tartarians, who are ordinarily strang; stout and bold People, and who easely suffer hunger, heat, and cold. They have no cityes, villager nor houses, but dwel by companyes (which they call Hordas) with wives, childern and cattel (in tabernakels &amp; tents in the fields) now here, to morrow elsewhere, wheresoe∣ver they finde good pastorage for theyr cattle, to wit, Oxen, Sheep, Horses and Kamels, with whose flesh, blood and milk they sustaine themselves. Theyr Prince one or the greatest Po∣tentates of the Earth they call Cham (that is Duke) to whome they shew singular obedience.</P>
<P>CHINA which is accounted the greatest, powerfulst, &amp; richest Kingdome of the whole World, is compassed on the East and South with the Orientall Ocean, which the An∣cient named Mare Eoum; on the west with India and Bramas; and on the North it is joyned with Tartary, where the Kings have divided it with an admirable wall of 400 miles in length, buylt betwixt the hils. It is divided in 15 Kingsdoms or great Provinces, they have each a Prince or King of theyr owne, who againe submit themselves all unto one supream King; who is able (according to the relation of the Portugals) in time of war∣re to bring in the field moor as 300000 Footemen and 200000 Horsemen. It is very fruytful of Korne, kattel, tame and wil∣de: it hath also mines of precious stones, gold, kopper, iron, steel and pearls and specialy there is great abundance of silk: it conteyneth great migry citities, which also are very populous. Of the great and glorious city Paquin (where the King hath his residence) are almost incredible things written. The inha∣bitans are very witty and sutle, inespecially in Manifactuurs, they make wagons with which they sayle over Land, as with ships in the Zea. The art of printing and making of pieces of ordonances hath bin by them farre sooner in use as by us. They have good civil lawes, according to which they live; but the true knowlegde of God they want, sith they are heathens, and adore Sun, Moone, and other idols, jea the Divel hunself, least he doe them any evil. The principal commodities which come out of China, are, gold, precious stones, musk, rhubarb, the root China, fine earthen platters, abundance of silke, sugar, rijs, cotton, linnen and korne.</P>
<P>INDIEN situated betwixt Persien, the hil Tauri, China, &amp; the Indian Sea, is (as all writers Witnes) the best and nobe∣lest Countrey on Earth, or which produceth the beautifulst &amp; best fruit, as wel those which serve for Mans sustenance a plea∣sure. It replenisheth the whole World withis precious stones and pearles, kostly spices, medicinal drugs and perfumes, in such a manner that (if Paradys where no where to be had) this whole Countrey might betearmed a terrestrial Paradys. Many Kingdoms and rich countreys are therein conteyned, as the Kingdom of the great Mogol, which is properly Indien, Cam∣baja, Orixa, Bengala, Aracan, Pegu, Malacca, Siam, Tipura, Gouro, &amp;c. Calicut, situated in Malabar, wont not long since to be the chief city of whole Indien, which at this time is called Coa: here have the Deputy of Portugal, the Arch-Bisshop, the Kings Counsel and the Chauncellors theyr residence, to commaund over all the Quarters of the Eastparts appertayning to the King of Spayne. Among many strange thing and trees which grow in Indien, are the tree de Rais and the tree Triste very wonderfull. The tree de Rais or root-tree groweth first from below as other trees doe, but spreading its branches, they grow ful of sprigs and roots, which bowing &amp; growing down∣ward to the earth, at last grow fast there and take root, and in progres of time grow so thick as the first root, so that they are hardly to be discerned one from anoter: out of which againe others round about grow to an innumerable number; so that such trees in time spread themselves in a round circle an Italian mile farre; and not onely that the lowes branches thrust theyr twigs &amp; rootes downwards (which afare of is as a deal of han∣ging hemp) but also the uppermost highest, in such a manner that one onely tree maketh a close wood.</P>
<P>De Arbore triste or the sadtree, so called, because he doth not slourish by day but alwayes by night; a strange thing to behold. As long as the Sun is not set, this tree appeareth as withered, and when the Sunne is set, there is no blossom to be seen on it; but presently an half houre after, it is as ful of blos∣soms as may be, very faire to behold, and of an exceding plea∣sant smel, and continueth so the whole night: but as soone as the day and Sunne returneth, doe all the blossoms fall of, that there remayneth not one on the tree, and cover the Earth, and the leaves shut themselfs half, so that he seemeth to be withe∣red and dead; this continueth til evening, then it beginneth to get blossoms as before; and continueth so the whole year.</P>
<P>PERSIA very famous in respect of the 2<SUP>de</SUP> Monarchy, comprehendeth many Countreys and Provinces, is a very potent rich countrey, and is governed by the Sophi, who (though he be a Mahumetist) warreth continually against the Turck for the religion of Mahumet, and that in respect of the several expositions of the Alcoran. Out of Persia are brought precious stones, Oriental Pearls, the cordial stone Bezoar, much silk-work, and very fayr Horses.</P>
<P>The nobelest &amp; fayrest Pearls which are found in the whole East, and which are called the right Oriental Pearls, are found in the Gulf of Persia, betwixt Ormus and Bassora, in the Pla∣ces of Bare in Caryffa, Julfar &amp; other places thereabout. These are fished by Divers, which are therein experienced, going ten, twelff, twenty and more fathoms under water, and growe in Oisters, which the Dippers (being naked) grable swiffly on the bottom, and with a small baskef, which they have bound about theyr body bring them with them above water; being layd in the Sunne, they goe open of theyr owne accord, and therein are found the Pearls.</P>
<P>ZEYLAN is one of the best and fruytfulst Ilands which are knowne at this day, the Earth is there alwayes green, and the trees loadened with blossems and fruit, producing the fayrest Oreng appels, Lemmons, Citrons, and such like fruyt. The best Cinamon groweth here with hole bonshes. This pleasant fruit is the ondermost or second rind of tree, is cut of in foure square pieces, is of an asch-colour, being laid in the Sunne and rould up together, it becommeth red, and in three years after the trees have theyr rinde or bark again. Besides many other creatures there are multitude of Elephants, which are supposed to surpasse all Elephants of other Countroys in wit and nobilite.</P>
<P>Westward from Zeylan are situated the Ilands Maldivia, more (as is reported) then eleven thousand in number, which are most inhabited, and some for theyr lownes not inhabited: here are not much other commodities then Coques, that is, Indian nuts, and these in such abundance, that the Inhabitants doe wholy maintaine themselves with them, &amp; the leve almost whole Indien. The rind, or, that which sitteth about the fhel of this nut is the hemp of Indien, where of they make kabels &amp; all sortes of ropes. They make theyr Ships of the wood of this tree, and sewe them together with koardes made of this afore∣named rind, without the use of an iron needle. The leaves of
<PB REF="6"/> the tree they use for theyr sayles. In one word, the ship withal its appurtances, they victual and also merchandize where with it is loadened is all of this onely date tree, which maintayneth all the Inhabitants of these Ilands.</P>
<P>SUMATRA which in former times (according to the Opinion of many) was wont to be called Taprobana, is divided under severall Kings: of all these is he of Achem the most potent. Here groweth (besides severall other spices) plen∣ty of very good Peper. Also there are mines of severall mettals, whereof the Inhabitants make good peeces of Ordonnance. Here are found very big Elephants, which being tamed, are very fit for warre, they have theyr residence in the woods, by whole troupes: here is also to be seen the creature Rhinoceros, the arch-anemy of the Elephant, and thoug it be farr lesse, yet notwithstanding it dare enter battle with it: it doth whet its hornes against the rocks, and thereby endeavoureth to teare up the belly of the Elephant. Many judge it to be the right Unicorn. What soever part of body this creature hath, but especially the horne, is accounted very precious for the expel∣ling of all venome.</P>
<P>JAVA is very fruitfull of severall spices and Indian fruyts, especially here groweth great plenty of Pepper. Is divided among many Kings, of which the great Mataran, he of Bantam, and he of Tuban are the mightiest. They who dwel on Sea∣shore are Mahumetists, in the Countrey they are heathens. On Java the Hollanders have buyle the city and strong fort Batavia where formerley Jacatra hath bin; it is the chiefest Colonie &amp; residence of the Governeur.</P>
<P>BANDA is a small Iland, but very famous; for here alone and on some Ilands thereabout grow all the nutmucks &amp; Mace, which are dispersed in great plenty over all the World. The trees on which the nutmeks grow are something alike the pear-tree of persick-tree, onely that they are smaller. The nut∣meks are covered with a threefold shel or rinde: the outmost is as the green rindes of acornes: when these are ripe, they divi∣de or separate themselves asunder, and then there is to be seene a rind or bast, like a small net, where with the fruit is compas∣sed about, fayre red of colour, like unto scarlet, pleasant of sigt, which wee call Mace or the blom of the nutmek. When the fruit is ripe and groweth drye, the Mace breaketh forth, and becometh then an Orange couler. The third rinde or shel is some what harder &amp; woodenish then the former; as the acor∣ne-nuts, safe that it is blackish, and that being opened, the∣rein wee find the Nutmek. Three times in the jear these trees afforde ripe fruit, to wit in August, in December, and the best and most in April. In Banda is to be seene a wonderfull bird, which they call Eme, being almost once as big as a Swan, ha∣ving black feathers, but no winges nor tong, above its head it hath a sharpnes or shield, as a shell-crab, he doth protect and defend him self with his strong hookes, striking behind him as a horse. He devoureth all that is cast before him, thoug it were apples as big as a fist, and that which is most to be admired, bur∣ning koles and great pieces of ice. In the year 1596 have the Hollands Ships brought such a bird a live at Amsterdam, for an admirable rarity.</P>
<P>The Ilands of Moluccen, situated under the Aequinoctial li∣ne, and a little towards the North (thoug they be small) are notwith-standing famous over the whole world, in regard of cloves which growe onely in these places; and are vijf number, to wit, Ternate, Tidore, Motir, Machian and Bachian. The trees on which the cloves grow, are like the laurel-tree or bay∣tree in bignes and fashion, onely that the leaves are smaller; like unto the almond or willow-leaves, they have many twigs and plenty of flowers, which first are white, afterward green, and at the last red and somewhat hard, and doe change in the∣se fruit, which wee call cloves. When these flowers are green they have the most pleasant smel above all flowers in the Worl∣de. The flowers grow very close together in great quantity on the utmost of the sprigs, as the berryes of the Myrtle-tree. These Ilands afford very little to the sustenance of man life; here groweth no rice nor korn; there are also no catle, but fewe bukgoat and hens. Theyr bread they make of some trees and roots. Onely in these Ilands are to be found the Paradijs-birde, which in strange &amp; beautiful feathers surpasseth all other birds in the World.</P>
<P>AFRICA, the third part of the old World, is divided from Europe through the Mediterranean, and from Asia through the red Sea. The chief Countreys of Africa are Bar∣Bary, Aegypt, Biledulgerid, Sarra, the Countrey of the Ethio∣pians, the Abissines, of Priest Johns Countreys, and Meno∣motapa. The Islands appertaining to Africa, are those of Ca∣naria, Cabo de Verde, S. Thomas Madagascar, &amp; Sacotora. Out of Africa are brougt in Europe, Gold, Yvorie, Eben-wood, Aloe, the Aegyptian Balzem-olye, Mumia, Myrrh, Feathers, Sugar, Ginger, Daats and some Wines from Madera, and the Ilands of Canari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</P>
<P>BARBARY, the best part of Africa, hath on the South the mountaynes of Atlas; on the West, the Atlantish; &amp; on the North the Mediterranean Zea. It is divided into four Kingdomes, as Marocco, Fez, Telesin and Tunes it is wate∣red with many Rivers, which flowing out of the hils Atlas, Powreth out her waters in the Mediterranean Zea. The King∣dom of Fez, which is farre forth the mightiest of Barbary, hath its name derived from the Mother-city Fez, a fayr and popu∣lous city partly environed with Walls and fortwith mountai∣nes and rocks. It is reported that in the same are 700 chur∣ches, where of the Mother-church comprehendeth a large round place, having 30 high and very spacious dores. Here grow ordinarily many daats, Oranges, Olives, Figs, and such like fruyt, but not much wine. The Inhabitants are white or jollow Mores, commonly an upright and good, but dom and uncapable people.</P>
<P>EGYPT hath bin many years hence a famous Countrey, so admirable fruytful, when the River Nile doth but keepe its ordinary course, and flowe 13 cubites over the Land, that the Poët Lucan doth highly extol it. The aforesayd flood be∣ginneth commonly to encrease in the beginning of June, and continueth 40 dayes: then it doth by litle and litle decrease, &amp; as soone as any part of the Countrey runneth drie, they begin to cast theyr zeed in the earth, not standing in need of rayne or any other humidty. The Aegyptians have bin in former times very futtel and witty, great Astronomers and Physicians, but exceeding superstitious.</P>
<P>The Pyramides, which are reckoned among the seven mi∣racles of the world, where formerly erected in this place by theyr Kings, eyther for vayn glory and ostentation of theyr great power and wealth, or to keep the people in action that they might not betake them selves to ydelnes.</P>
<P>ETHIOPIA or ABISSINEN hath northward Ly∣bien and Egypt; towards the West the River Nigar, and the Kingdom of Congo; towards the South the Maensber∣gen; and towards the east the Kingdoms of Melinde, Maga∣doxa and the red Sea, and though here grow but little korne, notwithstanding it beareth much fruyt, unkowne to us, first for maintenance of Mans life. The Inhabitans are Christians have one King who by us is called Priest John, but by them Acegue &amp; Negus, that is Emperour and King: He writes that he is of the house of David: is able to rayse ten hondert thou∣send Men of warre, and 500 Elephants, besides a great num∣ber of horses and Camels, they have one Patriarch, whome they call Abuma, who is the head of the Clergii: have Cloi∣sters for Men and Women, but the Monkes as also the Priest being married, must maintaine themselves with theyr own la∣bour and husbandry. They mixe the gospel and the old Testa∣ment among one another: circumcise both male and female kind, and baptize them with water and fire, to wit, in burning some tokens on theyr face; and the baptism of water is yearly revewed by them. They keep also lent; which continueth with them 50 dayes, with water and bread, and some of them with green hearbs. They have besides these many other cere∣monies &amp; superstitions to tedious to relate.</P>
<P>BILEDULGERID beareth that name from the palm or Daat-tree, which groweth here in quantity. The Inha∣bitants are dul &amp; borsh, without any good lawes or manners. All theyr trade consists in dates and Marmelstone, which they exchange with the Outlanders for Korne, which no where is sowed here.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have shortly run over the chief Countreys of the Old World: now follow the New World of America, which in the division of the whole earth, we place for the second part, which ordinarily is placed for the 4<SUP>th.</SUP> part of the World. This Countrey hath bin unknowne to the Ancient, and found in the year of our Lord 1497 by Americus Vespusius a Florenti∣ne, after whome it is called America; though this honour be not without reason attributed to Christopher Columber of Geneve, who in the year 1492 first hath discoured it. It may be almost divided in two Ilands: sith it is onely with a smal neck annexed unto Panama and Nombre de Dios. The Northern part comprehendeth New Spain, Florida, Virginia, the New Low-Countreys, New Frans, New England, Canada, &amp; Terra
<PB REF="7"/> Nova, on the North it is yet unknowne; the South part con∣teyneth Guajana, Castilia del Oro, Peru, Chili, Brasilien, Paraguay, and other Provinces more.</P>
<P>NEW-SPAYN conteyneth many Provinces and Na∣tions of severall languages. The chief city of this Coun∣trey is Mexico, a Queen of all the cities of the new world. Be∣fore the Spanjards came hither, the number of the houses were 70000, and was situated in the midst of a great or large lake or standingh poole, almost as Venice: but Ferdinandus Cortez, who in the jears 1519 and 1520. hath brought these Coun∣treys under the command of the King of Spayn, hath transpor∣ted the city on the shore of the lake, and is at he present a wel∣built city. The other principall cities next to Mexico, are, Com∣postella, (where the Bisshop hath his stool, and the Kings Council her residence,) Colima or Purficatio, Guadalajara, Mechoacan, Sacatula, and Civitas Angelorum, or the city of Angels. The commodities which are transported hence unto other parts of the World, are Gold, Silver, Pearls, Balzem-Oyl, Concenille or Scarlet-die, Salsaparilla, the reat Mechoacanna, Brimstone and Hides.</P>
<P>FLORIDA is pleasant and indifferent fruitfull countrey. Here growe mulberries, cherries, chesnuts, grapes, medlers and prunes. Here are also ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, goates, beares, leopards, and many other creatures; also peakocks, partridges, parrets, and manifold birds, which are yet unknown to us. In the Rivers are many and several Serpents, and many Crocodils, which the inhabitants most continually seek to oppose. As for the man∣ners of the inhabitants, they are for the most part rude and not chast. They doe not let their Children learn na art nor trade, neither reprove them for their faults. From robbing and to keep that which they have tobbed as their owne, they make no conscience. Every one nothwithstanding hath his owne wife, and are very jealous, account no thing so precious as the cu∣rious colours of the feathers of birds. They doe beleeve the im∣mortality of soules, but are otherwise Idolaters.</P>
<P>PERU, the most famaus place of all Countreys in the world, hath on the North Castilia del Oro; on the east the hils; on the South Chili; and on the West the great Southern Zea. The prime city is Lima, otherwise called Ciudad de los Reyes: there the Deputy hath his residence, also the Arsch-Bisshop, having under him for Bisshops-cities, Quito, Cusco, Guamanga, Guanuco, Popoian, Gajaquil, Chacapoias, Porto Vejo, Arequipa, Plata, Trugillo, Charchi, S. Miguel &amp; S. Fran∣cisco. This Countrey is temperate of ayr, very populous, and fruitfull of precious stones, bezoar-stone, Salsaparilla, and espe∣cially of gold and silver: for it is accounted for one of the richest in the world in regard of this acceptable and desirable Metall; which is also easily to be conceived from the great treasures which have bin many jears hence, and yet are, conveyged thence. That which the Historians write of Peru is almost in∣credible. Atabaliba, King of Peru, when the Spanjaerts came first thither, &amp; tooke him prisoner, offered for his redemption, to fil up the place, where he lay imprisoned, with gold, so high as he standing on his toes, where able to reach with his fin∣gers; the place was 22 feet in length, and 17 in breadth; or if they rather wold have Silver, he wold fil the place twice up to the top of the house. It appeareth also out of histories, that the Spanjards in their first coming thither did cover the hoofs of their horse with Gold and Silver, from Peru are transported in to Europe Gold, Silver, Precious stones, Besoar-stone, Salsapa∣rilla, and more other things of an healingh nature.</P>
<P>CHILI is also larg Countrey, rich of Gold, but as yet litle knowne, much lesse conquered by the Spanjards, against which nation the inhabitans (for the defence of their liberty) continually warre, wherein also they carre themselves manly.</P>
<P>BRASIL is towards the east and north compassed about with the Sea: towards the west &amp; north it hath the large River of the Amasones, and to the South de Rio de la Plate. This is a very pleasant and fruitful Countrey, and of an healthy ayre. This Province is divided by the Portugals into 9 gou∣vernments, which they call Capitanias, other doe reck on 14, to wit, S. Vincent, R. de Jenero, Porto Seguro, Spirito Santo, Itheos, Bahia, Seregipe, Phernambuco, Tamaraca, Parayba, Rio Grande, Ciara, Maranhahon, and Para; though some of these surpasse the bounds of Brasil. The inhabitants are called Margajaten, Trabajaten, Ovetacaten, Tovoupinambaultien, Morpions, and many more: most all of them cruel and wild people, and eaters of mankind. They goe stark naked, Men and Women: Adorne themselves with feathers, they bore in their lips and cheeks great holes, in which they place certaine little stones or bones, which is of a terrible sight. They are stran∣gers to all civil governement and religion, they known neither honour heavenly nor earthly Gods: beleeve notwithstanding the immortality of the Soules, and that those who have taken prisoners, killed eaten many Enemies, live with their Fore-fa∣thers in delight &amp; dancing: and on the contrary that the slow are carried away and tormented of the Aignan, that is, the di∣vel, who doth plange them. They warre alwayes one against another, the one Nation against the other: their weapons are wooden spears or Javelins, bowes, and arrows. Their enemies whome on both sides they take prisoners, they make fat as swine, and afterward kil them with many ceremonies, and being roasted on their woodden grid-irons, eath them up. The Margajaten are friends to the Portugals, through whose con∣versation they by degrees are tamed, and made subject to lawes and civil gouvernement besides Brasily-wood, cotton &amp; other things more, doth Brasil afford, more as other Countreys, great quantity of sugar, which groweth in long reedes or canes, these they breake, and grinde them with mils, afterward seeth or boyle them in ketles, and so they draw the pleasant sweetnes out of it.</P>
<P>The principal Ilands of the new world are Hispaniola, Cu∣ba, Jamaico and S. Juan de Porto Rico. Hispaniola is also cal∣led S. Domingo, after S. Dominicus, to whose honour they have built there a city, which is the head-city of all the rest; there the Deputy of the King and the Bisshop have their resi∣dence. It is al hilly, but above all other a pleasant and fruitfull Countrey. Here growet great plenty of sugar, Cassia Fistula, Mastix, and great store of the best ginger. Here are also good mines of Gold and Silver, and from thence are brought abun∣dance of Hides.</P>
<P>CUBA is a long small Iland, and also Mountainous, hath many gold-bearing rivers. The Spanjards have built there two cities, S. Jago, where the Bisshop dwelleth, and Havana, the Matt-touwn and haven of the Iland, very strong, where the fleet zayling from the Westindis to Spain doth ordinarily meet, and wayte for winde and weather for to zayle over.</P>
<P>Some wont to cal for a fifth part of the world Terra Austra∣lis or Magellanica, the Countreys in the South of the Streat Magellanes; but sith the shipping by the Hollanders to those parts, but some few jears hence it known, that Tierra del Fue∣go, by Magellanes called, is nothing than a heap of Ilands; and no firm land there about, which may beare the name of the 5<SUP>th.</SUP> part of the world, I thinke it sufficient that I have touched it with these few words, except, two will call Terra Australis, those Countreys in the South of Nova Guinea, whether the Hollanders most zayled in the jear 1644. and in these our Maps are called Hollandia Nova, and Nova Zelandia. Noth∣withstanding sith the Coasts are but partly discovered, and that we have no knowledge of the inwards Countreys, wee shall as yet let them rest under Asia, til further discovery; and com∣mend such a division to our Posterity, if wee by our life gaine no more knowledge.</P>
