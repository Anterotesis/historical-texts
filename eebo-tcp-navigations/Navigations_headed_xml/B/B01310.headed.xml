<P>An Abstract of the most material <HI>Interlocutors</HI> in the two <HI>Decreets</HI> of the Lords of Session, in favour of the Owners of the two <HI>Danish</HI> Ships, the <HI>Palm-tree,</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> of <HI>Sunderburg,</HI> against Captain <HI>Acheson</HI> and his Owners, in whose favour they were adjudged, Reducing the Admirals Decreets, and ordaining the <HI>Capers</HI> to pay the Value of the Ships and Goods.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Upon Debate of the Reasons of Reduction, <HI>in praesentia,</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>22. February 1673. THE LORDS FIND</HI> that Reason of Adjudication, that the Strangers had not Passes conform to the <HI>Formula</HI> agreed upon in the Treaty betwixt the Kings Maiesty and the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> (albeit the Ships loosed from <HI>Norway,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Iuly, 1672.</HI> long after the breaking out and knowledge of the War) not to inferre a Confiscation of the Ships, and Loadings alone; But that it importeth a just ground to seize and bring the same to Tryal, and that it putteth the burden of Probation upon the Strangers, by Documents and Witnesses above exception: That the Ships and Loadings belong to the Kings Allies, and Freemen, and not to the Kings Enemies <HI>AND FIND,</HI> that the Oaths of the Skippers and Owners, which would have been sufficient, if they had been adhibited at the obtaining of the Passes, conform to the <HI>Formula,</HI> are not now sufficient to clear the Property of the Ships and Loadings. <HI>AND THAT</HI> the being of no Passes aboard relative to the Voy∣age, but general Passes before the War, and that by the Skippers Oaths, it appears that they con∣cealed the Fraught-Brieffs, and that they were hid apart from the rest of the Documents and found by the Privateer; and bear a greater Fraught to be paid, in case the Ships were brought up to <HI>Holland;</HI> provided a safe Delivery were made of the Goods; <HI>DOTH IMPORT,</HI> an intended Delivery of the Goods in <HI>Holland,</HI> notwithstanding of the Missives and Documents aboard. <HI>AND FIND</HI> the same grounds joyntly to be a sufficient presumptive Probation of a Contrivance, and that the Ships and Goods are not free. <HI>BVT YET,</HI> to admit of a contrary positive Probation by Documents and Witnesses above exception; That the Ships and Loadings belong to the Subjects of <HI>Denmark,</HI> His Majesties Allies, unless the Privateer prove the same to belong to the Kings Enemies. <HI>LIKE AS THE LORDS FIND,</HI> that the true Port being concealled, or made Arbitrary by the Fraught-Briefs, if the Privateer should instruct. That Dail-boards such as were in these Ships, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounterband by the Custome of the Admirality of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> that ground was sufficient, (though the Ships and Goods were proven to belong to Freemen) to infer Confiscation of both. <HI>THEREFORE THE LORDS <HI>granted Commission mutually, to either Party, for proving the Property and Value of the Ships and Goods; the quantity of the Loadings, and that the Port designed was</HI> London: <HI>And to the Defenders, that the Goods were Counterband.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>But upon a Petition given in by the Pursuers, Representing a mistake in the said <HI>Interlocutor,</HI> as to the matter of the Fraught, (the Fraught being not a greater for <HI>Holland,</HI> than for <HI>England,</HI> but a lesse.) And craving the Benefit of a contrary Probation, as to the matter of Counter∣band, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>Eodem die.</HI> The Lords ordain these words, <HI>Viz, [That the Fraught-Briefs bear a greater Fraught to be paid, in case the Ships were brought up to <HI>Holland,</HI> provided a safe Delivery were made of the Goods, which the Lords find, did import an intended Delivery of the Goods in <HI>Holland,</HI> Notwithstanding of the Missives and Documents aboard;</HI> to be left out of the <HI>Interlocutor,</HI> and grant a contrary Probation to the Pursuers to prove, That Dails are not Counterband; And ordain the Probation to be <HI>hinc inde,</HI> vp Docu∣ments above exception.</P>
<P><HI>Upon Report made of the Commissions, by the Pursuers from the Magistrates of <HI>Sunderbare</HI> and <HI>Christiania,</HI> and from the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> with an Attestation from the Admirality of <HI>Holland,</HI> and His Majesties Declaration in favour of the <HI>Danes.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>25. February, 1674.</HI> The Lords having advised the Reports with the Depositions of the Witnesses, contained therein. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then find that the property of the said Ships and Goods, doth belong to <HI>Carsten Matsen</HI> and <HI>Hanse Petersen.</HI> and their Owners, His Majesties Allies, And therefore Reduce the Decreets of Adjudication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Upon Informations given in <HI>hinc inde,</HI> in Relation to His <HI>Majesties</HI> INSTRUCTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>23. <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1674. The Lords having considered the <HI>Informations</HI> given in by either Party, together with His Majesties <HI>Instructions,</HI> especially that Artcle thereof, concerning concealled Documents, they notwithstanding thereof, adhere to their former Interlocutors and Decreets, Reducing the fore∣said Decreets of Adjudication, obtained before the Admiral, in regard of the Probation, That the Ships and Goods belong to the Kings Allies, and Freemen.</P>

<P>27.

<P>28. February, 1680. <HI>The Lords supersede Extracting of the Decreets till the</HI> 1. <HI>of</HI> Iune. <HI>To the ef∣fect the Defenders betwixt and that time may produce the Roupe, which was made of the Ships.</HI></P>
<P>And when <HI>June</HI> was come, and an Answer made to their Petition by the Strangers, upon Consideration of Both,</P>
<P>22. Iune 1680. <HI>The Lords adhere to their former Interlocutor of the</HI> 27.

<P>After which Interlocutor, upon a Petition given in by the Strangers, referring the Defenders Trading with the Ships to their Oaths; a Term was assigned them to Compear and Depone, And whereupon an Act being Extracted, and called, The Term was circumduced against them.</P>
<P>After the Extracting of the foresaid Act, whereupon the Term was circumduced against the Capers for not compearing to Depone anent their Trading with the Ships, Captain <HI>Acheson,</HI> Sir <HI>William Bruce,</HI> Sir <HI>James Standfield,</HI> Sir <HI>William Binning,</HI> and others, his Owners gave in a Pe∣tition: Upon which, though <HI>ipsis verbis,</HI> the same with the Petition immediately preceeding; the Lords ordained both Parties procurators to be heard <HI>in praesentia,</HI> as they were about three weeks after: And then upon a most contentious Debate, as to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Placaets, Double and Con∣ceall'd Documents, the King's Instructions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By an Interlocutor.</P>

<P>Much honoured and respected Friend, Signior <HI>John Shorter, Salutem.</HI> Your good Letter, the 21. <HI>May,</HI> with Skipper <HI>Carsten Matsen,</HI> is delivered into my hands: out of which, I perceive your good will towards my Husband <HI>Jens Paulsen</HI> of blessed memory. As concerning the agreement for Freight with the forenamed Skipper, to take in a Loading for you, I have with the help of good Friends, in the best manner and utmost diligence, done accordingly; as appeareth out of the in∣closed Memorial. I suppose you will continue in your real integrity towards me, as I did find you always towards my Husband of happy memory: and besides the Accompt of the foresaid Me∣morial, you will consider the great perills at Sea, which I shall leave to your good discretion. And it is my humble request, that you with the first would assist me with some Mony, either in <HI>Hamburg,</HI> or else here in the Countrey: because there is small occasion to draw a Bill of Exchange, of Ricks Dollars, from hence upon <HI>London;</HI> and I cannot do it except with great loss. And God knows how I stand in need of Mony for the present, to clear up my Husband, of happy memory, his Accompts, for his governing Office, notwithstanding there is a great deal, in respect of my Husbands good-will, resting unto me. Therefore, I took occasion the 8. <HI>ditto,</HI> to draw a Bill of Exchange upon you, payable to <HI>Claus Hansen.</HI> If the same shall be presented unto you, I ex∣pect your good payment, after that <HI>Hans Paulsen</HI> is well arrived. And if any occasion may hap∣pen, and I should send a Bill of Exchange upon you, I hope you shall accept of, and pay it. Wherein otherwise I can serve you, it shall be done. And hereby wishing you well, I recom∣mend you to the Lords protection, and remain,</P>

<P>The Informations given in for the Strangers, and the Capers, in relation to His <HI>Majestie's</HI> INSTRUCTIONS, whereupon the In∣terlocutor of the Lords <HI>July</HI> 23. 1674. proceeds, As the same are insert in the Decreets of the Lords, in the Strangers favour, pro∣nounced, <HI>Feb.</HI> 25. 1674. but not extraced till the 30. <HI>July</HI> 1680.</P>

<HEAD>Information for the STRANGERS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Reduction of the Decreets of <HI>Adjudication</HI> of the said Ships, the <HI>Palm-tree</HI> and <HI>Pa∣tience,</HI> the pretended grounds of <HI>Adjudication,</HI> being coincident as to both; the Lords, by their Interlocutor, <HI>Feb.</HI> 22. 1672. allowed the Pursuers to prove the Propency of the Ships, and Goods, and Value. And likewise to prove the <HI>Daills</HI> that were their Loadings, were not <HI>Counter-band</HI> by the <HI>Custom</HI> of the <HI>Admiralities</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Hol∣land.</HI> And allowed the Defenders to prove the contrary.</P>
<P>After which Interlocutor, there was a Bill given in by the Defenders, pretending, that by His <HI>Maiesties Instructions,</HI> it was declared; That <HI>the having or using</HI> of false, <HI>or</HI> double <HI>Do∣ctuments</HI> or <HI>co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling of Papers,</HI> was a just ground of Confiscation. And that it was proved, and acknowledged by the Skippers that there were <HI>concealed Papers</HI> the Skipper of the <HI>Palm-tree,</HI> hauing <HI>denyed,</HI> that he had any <HI>Charter-partie,</HI> which notwithstanding was concealed, a Ship-board; and the Skipper of the <HI>Patlentia,</HI> having declared, <HI>that he had no Paper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concealed, except a Charter partie, and missiue Letter.</HI> And thereupon craving, That the Ships, and Goods might be declared lawful Prise upon that ground. Notwithstanding whereof the Lords adhered to their former Interlocutor: but declared that they would consider the same, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me of the advising the Reports.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
<P>There was then Reports made upon the said Commission, whereby the points of the Inter∣locutor were fully cleared and proven, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Property of the Ships and Goods did belong to the Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts of the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and the Value was likewise proven, and the Customs of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> That <HI>Daills</HI> were not <HI>Counterband.</HI></P>
<P>It being alledged, That notwithstanding, the Ships and Goods must be declared lawful Prise upon the Pretences contained in the Bill, <HI>viz. That the Skippers acknowledge by their</HI> Depo∣sitions that <HI>there were Papers concealed.</HI></P>
<P>It was answered, The Pretences are of no weight: and it were indeed a Preparative, the like whereof did never escape the <HI>Publict Justice</HI> of any Nation, upon such impertinent and frivolous Conceits, to deprive his <HI>Majesties</HI> Allies of their Ships, and Goods, after so clear and full and undenyable a <HI>Probation</HI> of the Propertie, as is here proven at three several Places, <HI>vix. Sunder∣burg</HI> in <HI>Denmark, Christiania</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> and at <HI>London.</HI> So that it is impossible any scruple can remain, but that the Propertie of the Ships and Goods did truely belong to the Subjects of the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> and were as truely designed for the Port of <HI>London,</HI> as is clear by the same Probation.</P>
<P>And as to what was urged upon the <HI>concealing of Papers,</HI> albeit there had been Papers con∣cealed, His Majestie's <HI>Instructions</HI> could be here no ground of Confiscation. 1. Because his Majestie's <HI>Instructions</HI> were long after the Capture, and could not be extended <HI>quoad praeterita.</HI> 2. By the 24. Article of the <HI>Danish Treaty,</HI> which is <HI>lex bell,</HI> it is provided, that Justice and Equity should be administred to the Subjects of either Crown, <HI>according to the Statutes and Lows</HI> of either Countrie: and therefore no such private <HI>Instruction</HI> could prejudge the Pursuers contrary to the <HI>Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>But here the Pretence of <HI>concealing Papers</HI> was frivolous. For. 1. when the Ships were taken, the Skippers did produce to the Captain of the Privateer certain Papers, and cold him that they had those which were pretended to be <HI>concealed</HI> a Ship-board; and desired liberty to bring the same: which he refused, and insolently told them, <HI>That they behoved to go to Scot∣land,</HI> what ever Papers they had aboard, <HI>for they did not know what GREAT OWNERS be had.</HI> And withall then said, <HI>that they might then produce their Papers when they were in Scotland.</HI> 2. When they were brought to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Skippers before the Admiral, declared, <HI>That they had the said Papers a Ship-board,</HI> and were allowed to go a Ship-board and fetch them; and did go in company of the Privateer. And as one of the Skippers was taking out of one part of the Ship one Paper, the Captain of the Privateer, or some of his Officers did fall upon the <HI>other,</HI> not having the patience, till the Skipper took it out himself. And if that be a prettie <HI>Concealment,</HI> the Lords wre desired to judge. 3. What imaginable reason could there be, for any such <HI>fraudulent Concealment,</HI> as to <HI>Scots</HI> or <HI>English</HI> Capers; the Papers alledged to be <HI>concaled</HI> being Documents of the Ships <HI>Freedom,</HI> and that the <HI>Port designed</HI> was <HI>London:</HI> the Papers being <HI>Freight-brieffs,</HI> and <HI>missiue Letters,</HI> dicreet to Mr. <HI>Shorter,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Splide</HI> at <HI>London.</HI> 4. The <HI>Clause</HI> in His Majtstie's <HI>Instructions</HI> can only be understood in such a case, when Writs are <HI>abstracted</HI> and <HI>concealed,</HI> and whereof the <HI>tenor does not appear,</HI> and so <HI>in dubio</HI> are presumed for the condemnation of the Ship, or <HI>if found,</HI> do make out the same. But what is that to the purpose here? For, <HI>primo,</HI> The Deposition of the Skipper of the Ship called the <HI>Patientia,</HI> bears, <HI>That he had no Papers concealed, but a Charter partie, and a missive Letter, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go</HI> he having <HI>declared</HI> the same, it was no <HI>Concealment.</HI> And the sense of the Deposition is singly this; That he had them a Ship-board, and which he had hid upon the account of the <HI>Holland</HI> Capers, these clearing that the <HI>Port designed</HI> was <HI>London,</HI> and which did not appear from any of the Docu∣ments not concealed. <HI>Secundo.</HI> The Skippers deposition of <HI>the Palm-Treee,</HI> bears only a <HI>Denyal,</HI> that he had any <HI>Charter-parry:</HI> but he acknowledged that he had a Brieff, which is wronguously translated to be a <HI>Letter;</HI> although it is true that he had such a <HI>missive Letter.</HI> And <HI>Brieffs</HI> in the <HI>general</HI> comprehend all Papers. And the Paper found a Ship-aboard, was not a <HI>Charter-party,</HI> (which is a <HI>Contract</HI> subscribed by two, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Skipper</HI> and the <HI>Freighter</HI>) but onely a <HI>simple Obligement</HI> for payment of the <HI>Freight:</HI> so that this was no <HI>Concealment.</HI> And this was likewise hid for fear of <HI>Dutch Capers;</HI> and it is against sense, to pretend the contrary. And it were a rare piece of <HI>Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tice</HI> to condemn <HI>Ships</HI> upon those <HI>Papers,</HI> which are the <HI>Documents</HI> of their <HI>freedom.</HI> And there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he Case of any Ships, where there was so clear a <HI>Pro∣bation,</HI> add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced, as to all P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mission. And Capers should be ashamed to grasp after the Ships and Goods of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> and to make use of Pretences for that effect, which are <HI>absurd</HI> and <HI>ridiculous.</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, the Purs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers oppone the <HI>Reports,</HI> and the <HI>Probation</HI> adduced, which may co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ce any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that has a regard to <HI>Justice,</HI> that these <HI>Ships</HI> and Loadings are altogether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>And as to that Quality of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, bearing. <HI>That if Daills were proven counterband by the Customs of</HI> England <HI>or</HI> Holland, <HI>it should be a ground of Confiscation; albeit the Ships and Goods were proven to belong to free-m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n; in re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pect the Freight-Briefs are arbitrary, as to the Port.</HI></P>
<P>It was answered, 1. That it was absurd to pretend, that the <HI>Freight-Briefs</HI> are arbitrary, as to the Port, the Port of <HI>London</HI> being the true <HI>designed Port,</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> only mentioned in the case of <HI>contingency,</HI> in case the Ships should be brought up thither. 2. By the <HI>Probation</HI> ad∣duced, <HI>London</HI> is positively proven to have been the intended <HI>Port.</HI> 3. The Capers have not at
<PB N="20" REF="13"/> all proven, that by the <HI>Custom</HI> of the <HI>Admiralties</HI> of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> Daills are <HI>counter∣band;</HI> but on the contrary, it is proven by the <HI>Custom</HI> of the said <HI>Admiralties,</HI> that Daills <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re not <HI>counterband.</HI> 4. By an Extract under the hand of Secretary <HI>Coventry,</HI> of His Majesties De∣claration in favour of the <HI>Danes,</HI> it is evident, that no Goods are <HI>counterband</HI> as to the <HI>Danes,</HI> ex∣except <HI>Ammunition</HI> and <HI>warlike Instruments,</HI> and <HI>Victual carried to places besieged.</HI> So that al∣beit these Ships had been absolutely designed to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and that Daills, by the <HI>Custom</HI> of those <HI>Admiralties,</HI> were <HI>counterband,</HI> neither of which is true; yet, by virtue of the said Declaration, Daills are not <HI>counterband</HI> to the <HI>Danes.</HI> In respect of all which, there is not the least colour or pretence of Law, why the Decreets of Adjudication of these Ships should not be <HI>reduced,</HI> and the Ships and Goods <HI>restored,</HI> or the Value, as it is proven <HI>cum omni causa.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Information for the <HI>Capers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>And it being informed by the said Defenders and their Procurators, That in the Reduction of the Decreets of Adjudication of the foresaid Ships, pursued at the instance of the said Skippers, against the said Captain and his Owners; Amongst several grounds of Adjudication insisted upon, which are the grounds of the said Decreets, such as the <HI>informality of the Passes,</HI> and that there was no <HI>special</HI> Port <HI>designed:</HI> the principal ground was, That albeit the Skippers pretended, that the Ships and Goods belonged to Subjects of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and that the Goods were going to <HI>England,</HI> and were to be consigned to Merchants there; and that the Skippers being examined, <HI>concerning the having of any other Papers, but the Passes produced;</HI> They declared upon Oath, <HI>they had none, but each of them a missive Letter directed to their correspondents in</HI> England: And particularly, being examined <HI>if they had any Charterparties,</HI> they did expressly depone, <HI>That they had no Charterparties.</HI> And yet, when they had taken out their <HI>missive Letters,</HI> in a secret place upon one side of the Ship, affirming, they had no more; yet upon the other side of both Ships, a secret place was discovered, in which there was concealed <HI>Freight Briefs</HI> for each of the Ships, by which the Freighters did condition to pay to the Skippers of the respective Ships, each particular Freight upon safe Delivery of the Goods in <HI>Holland.</HI> From which it was Inferred the time of the Debate, That the Passes being <HI>general,</HI> and not condescending upon the <HI>Port,</HI> albeit missive Letters were directed to Persons at <HI>London;</HI> yet it was but a <HI>Contrivance,</HI> and which was clearly convelled by the <HI>Freight-Briefs,</HI> which conditioned a Freight for <HI>Holland.</HI> And albeit it was pretended by the Strangers, that these Freight-Briefs did condition a Freight both to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and only to <HI>Holland,</HI> in case they were taken up <HI>against their will,</HI> and <HI>that the Goods were safe delivered;</HI> yet, so pregnant were the grounds of <HI>prevarication</HI> and <HI>contrivance,</HI> that the Lords upon that Debate, considering, that the Skippers did swear, that they had no other Papers; they notwithstanding of their Oaths, found the <HI>Freight-Briefs</HI> to be <HI>concealed,</HI> and the grounds insisted upon, to be a sufficient <HI>presumptive Probation</HI> of a <HI>Con∣trivance:</HI> but yet found, that there was place for a <HI>positive contrary Probation,</HI> by Writ and Witnesses above exception, of the <HI>freedom of the Ships and Goods,</HI> and gave Commission for that effect.</P>
<P>The sold Lords would be pleased to consider, That long after this Debate, His <HI>Majestie's Instractions</HI> which were not then known to the Defenders in the Reduction, were sent to their Lordships: by which, it was most evident and clear, that the having of <HI>double Documents,</HI> or <HI>concealing</HI> of any <HI>Documents</HI> was <HI>per se,</HI> a sufficient ground of confiscation of Ships and Goods; Whereupon, if the Defenders had insisted, undoubtedly the Lords would have assoiled them. And therefore, seing the Lords, even before knowledge of His <HI>Majestie's Instructions,</HI> found the <HI>Pre∣sumptions</HI> of Prevarication and Concealment so strong, as appears by the Interlocutor, and albeit then, a <HI>contrary positive Probation</HI> of <HI>freedom</HI> was admitted; yet now the Defenders do found upon these emergent <HI>Instructions;</HI> and alledge, That <HI>esto argumenti causa,</HI> the Ships and Goods were <HI>free,</HI> which truely they are not, what ever be reported by Commissions, (wherein great Art and Prevarication is used) yet these <HI>matterial Papers</HI> being expressly <HI>concealed,</HI> and that upon Oath of the Skippers, <HI>swearing they had no such Papers:</HI> The very <HI>Concealment</HI> by the <HI>Instructions,</HI> is a sufficient ground of Confiscation, whether the Ships and Goods be <HI>free or not,</HI> and cannot admit of a <HI>contrary Probation.</HI> And therefore, it was hoped the said Lords would then advise the Reduction, conform to the <HI>Instructions,</HI> without any regard to what hath been done upon the Commissions; Whereby in <HI>Justice</HI> the <HI>Adjudications</HI> must be sustained: or otherwise in case any scruple remained with their Lordships, they would allow the Parties Pro∣curators a Hearing thereanent. Especially, seing upon a Bill lately given in by the Defenders, the said Lords declared, They would hear them upon the <HI>Instructions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Which Informations above written being upon the</HI> 24. July, 1674. <HI>considered by the Lords, together with His</HI> Majestie's Instructions, <HI>especially that Article there∣of concerning</HI> double <HI>and</HI> concealed Documents; THE SAID LORDS, <HI>Notwith∣standing thereof, adhered to their former Interlocutor and Decreet, in reducing the foresaid Decreets of Adjudication obtained before the</HI> Admiral; <HI>in regard of the foresaid Probation, that the Ships and Goods belonged to the King's Allies and Free-men.</HI></P>
