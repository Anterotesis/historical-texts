<P>The inward circle is divided into 360 Degrees, giving unto each Signe 30 degrees, the Semi∣diameter of the twelve Moneths is supposed to be divided into 60 parts, from which center is supposed another center to be two deg. 9. minutes of the said 60. parts, according to <HI>Ticho Brache,</HI> who m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>keth the place or point of the Sunnes <HI>Apogeum,</HI> to be in the 6. degree of <HI>Cancer,</HI> in this age of the world. The <HI>Apogeum</HI> of the Sun is that point in which when the Sunne commeth unto, hee is in his slowest motion, or furthest distant from the Earth, that is to say, <HI>Iune</HI> 17. then the Sunne shall be in the sixt degree of <HI>Cancer,</HI> the <HI>Perigeum</HI> of the Sunne, shall be when it commeth into the sixt degree of <HI>Capri∣corne,</HI> being opposite to the sixt degree of <HI>Cancer.</HI> The second moveable part is divided into 29 dayes and one halfe, which doth shew the age of the Moone. The next Circle is divided in∣to 24 Houres, and each houre into foure Quarters, each quarter into three parts, each part being five minutes.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The use of this Figure may be this.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst, the day of the Moneth being given to find the place of the Sunne in the Zodiack, or the place of the Sun being given to find the day of the moneth: Take the Index of the Sunne and bring it to the day of the moneth, sheweth the place of the Sun in the Zodiack of the 12 Signes. Example, Aprill 14. the place of the Sunne will be found to be in the fourth degree of <HI>Taurus.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, the day of the Change or New Moone being given to finde the age of the Moone, the signe and degree shee posses∣seth in the Zodiack, the time of her comming to the South, and time of full Sea or high water in any Haven, knowing the time of the Changes or full Moone after this manner.</P>
<P>In some Almanack (or by the Expact) find the day of the change of the Moone going before the day that yee desire; and so many dayes after the Change so many dayes old is the Moone.</P>
<P>First, bring the Index of <HI>Sol</HI> or the Sunne to the day of the moneth, and there stay it. Secondly, bring the Index of the Moone, to the age of the Moone, and it sheweth the signe and degree that she possesseth in the Zodiack, the houre and minute under the age, is the time of her comming to the South.</P>
<P>Thirdly, to finde the time of high water.</P>
<P>In the Table following find the name of the Port or Haven, and the houre and minute against that Haven is the houre and minute that yee shall adde to the time of the Moones comming to South, is the time of highwater in the said place.</P>

<P>BLazing Starres or Comets are flames drawne into the higher <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and long quiet∣nesse in the Ayre: They signifie corruption in the ayre to follow; They are either signes of warres and death, or tokens of earth∣quakes, and dearth of Corne. In the yeare 1618. there happened a fearefull blazing Starre from the 18 of November to the 16 of December following: Jt was seene all over Europe; The Coun∣tries it passed ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, were Nova Guinea, the Ile of Java, Sumatra, Madagascar, Monomotapa Picora, Nombre de Jesus.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The manner of the Moones Eclipse.</HEAD>
<P>THe word Eclipse is as much to say as to want light, and to be darkned, or hidden from our sight.</P>
<P>The Moones Eclipse is figured at the foote of <HI>America,</HI> over against your left hand, which is thus: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<PB REF="3"/>
<P>When the Sunne and Moone are opposite one to the other dia∣metrally, and the Earth in the very midst between both: that is, when a right line drawne from the center to the Sun to the cen∣ter of the Moone, passeth through the center of the Earth: For the body of the Earth being thick and not transparent, casting his shadow to that point which is opposite of the place of the Sun, will not suffer the Moon to receive any light from the Sun, from whom she alwaies borroweth her light: And note, that e∣very time she is at the full, she is opposite to the Sunne, and yet the Earth is not at every such full diametrally betwixt her &amp; the Sun, for then she should be eclipsed at every full, which indeed cannot be, unlesse she be either in the head or taile of the Dragon.</P>
<P>Now the Moone is eclipsed in part, when the Sun, the Earth, and the Moone, be met in one selfe diametrall line, but the Moon is declining either on the one side or on the other.</P>
<P>But note that eclipses of the Moone may be universall, because the Earth is far bigger than the Moone, and thereby able to sha∣dow her whole body,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The manner of the Sunnes Eclipse.</HEAD>
<P>THe Eclipse of the Sunne is shewed by that figure at the foot of <HI>Asia,</HI> against your right hand, and happeneth</P>
<P>When the Moone is betwixt the sunne and the Earth, which chanceth in a Conjunction or new of the Moone: and yet not in every Conjunction, but when it falleth either in the head or taile of the Dragon, which may chance (as is said before) either totally, or in part; totally, in respect of those parts of the Earth whereon the shadow directly falleth. For sith the Moone is far lesse than the Earth, she cannot shadow all the Earth, and there∣fore the eclipse of the sun cannot be universall but yet to some part of the Earth it may be totally, to some partly, and to others nothing at all; as may appeare by the aforesaid Figure.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Firmament and Constellations.</HEAD>
<P>THe two Hemispheares in the middle about; filled with Fi∣gures of men, beasts, fishes, and the like embost with starres, doe represent the face of the Firmament or Orbe of the fixed starres (those that appeare every night) which were by ancient Astronomers divided into and distinguished by certain Constel∣lations, and each of these is knowne by a proper name; Of these Constellations, the number (according to the ancient account) is 48, that are divided into three parts:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Northerne Constellations, being 21 in number.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Zodiacke Constellations, being 12 in number.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Southerne Constellations, being 15 in number.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Northerne Constellations consist of 332. starres.</P>
<P>The Zodiacke Constellations, which be also called the twelve signes, consist of 280 starres.</P>
<P>The Southerne Constellations, containe 293 starres,</P>
<P>Some of these Constellations, consist of more, some of fewer starres, according to their greatnesse or smalnesse,</P>
<P>Besides these there are 1205 stars that are exempt out of all the Constellations: so that the number of stars set upon both Hemi∣spheares are 1025, and divers of them have proper Names.</P>
<P>But here is to be understood, that all the starres in Heaven are not numbred, nor cannot, for that divers of them are so small; but these 1025 are the principallest amongst them, and all that have yet ever beene accounted of.</P>
<P>The two first parts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, that is, the Northerne and Zodiack Constellations are contained in that part right against your left hand, and placed over a piece of <HI>America;</HI> The last, that is, the Southerne, is comprehended in that other Hemispheare on your right hand, and over the European Sea,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Figure of the heavenly Orbes and Elements,</HEAD>
<P>THe whole world is divided into two parts, <HI>viz. Elementall,</HI> and <HI>Etheriall</HI> or <HI>Coelestiall</HI> parts.</P>
<P>The Elementall part is four-fold; <HI>viz. Earth, Water, Ayre, Fire,</HI> as may be seen in that round Figure of the frame of the hea∣vens and elements one within another; the inmost and middle∣most circle containing Earth and Water intermixed together; The next, the three Regions of the Aire: and immediatly above that Orbe, is the Element of Fire; all which you may easily dis∣cerne by their severall names in their proper places.</P>
<P>The Etheriall or Coelestiall parts doe compasse the Elementall part: and containe the ten upper Spheares, <HI>viz,</HI> 1 the <HI>Moone,</HI> 2 <HI>Mercury,</HI> 3 <HI>Ʋenus,</HI> 4 <HI>Sol,</HI> 5 <HI>Mars,</HI> 6 <HI>Iupiter,</HI> 7 <HI>Saturne,</HI> 8 the <HI>Starry firmament,</HI> 9 the <HI>Christaline heaven,</HI> having no stars at all; the 10 is the <HI>Primum mobile,</HI> or first Mover, containing all the rest within it; and moving from the East to the West carri∣eth about with it in violence all the other Spheares.</P>
<P>The rest of the Spheares have contrary motions, every one in his kinde, though far slower than the other: and their motions are contrary, from the West to the East, and so are carried about oftentimes by the first Mover, before they make one perfect re∣volution in themselves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Christaline</HI> or ninth Spheare his motion is almost immen∣sible, and is called <HI>The trembling Motion,</HI> and is performed, according to the opinion of later Astronomers, in 49000 yeares.</P>
<P>The eight Spheare being the <HI>Starry Firmament</HI> performeth his motion in 7000 yeares.</P>
<P>The rest of the Spheares are the seven Planets; each Spheare containeth in it but one starre; whereof the uppermost and slow∣est is <HI>Saturne,</HI> which perfecteth his course in thirty yeares. <HI>Iupi∣ter</HI> being next under that makes his revolution in twelve yeares. <HI>Mars</HI> beneath him, finisheth his course in two yeares. <HI>Sol</HI> passeth through the Zodiacke in 365 dayes and six houres, which is one whole yeare. <HI>Ʋenus</HI> ends her course somewhat more than a yeare. <HI>Mercury</HI> holds equall pace with the Sunne. <HI>Luna</HI> cour∣seth about the Heaven once every eight and twenty dayes.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Circles of this Mappe, and their uses.</HEAD>
<P>THe Imaginary parts of the Earth are such, which not being at all in the Earth, must yet be supposed to be so, for the better teaching and learning this Science; and are certaine Cir∣cles going about the Earth, answerable to them in Heaven in name.</P>
<P>The <HI>Meridian</HI> (which comes first to be considered) is a great Circle compassing round the Earth from Pole to Pole; and is that which you see in the circumference of both Planispheares of the Map; and wherein are written the names of the Zones &amp; Climates. This chiefe, first, fixed Meridian passeth through the Islands called Azores, according to the ancient Cosmographers; and there are two reasons why they did there begin to reckon the longitude of the Earth:</P>
<P>First, for that at that time there was no Land knowne further to the Westward than that place.</P>
<P>Secondly, under that Meridian the Needle in the Mariners Compasse had no variation, but did point directly North and South.</P>
<P>There be also many Meridians according to the diverse place in which a man lives, the number of them equall to so many points as may be imagined in the Globe; but the usuall setting them knowne to view, is by ten degrees asunder; and are those blacke lines which you see in both Planispheares, running down along from the North to the South Pole.</P>
<P>The use of the Meridian, is to shew the Longitude of any place. Now the longitude of a Region, City or Cape, is the di∣stance of it East from the first great Meridian; and this ongitude is measured and numbred in the Aequinoctiall line by Meridians from the generall and fixed Meridian, into the East, and contain∣eth the whole compasse of the Earth, <HI>viz.</HI> 360. degrees</P>
<P>To prove this by example, cast your eye on <HI>London,</HI> and you shall see it something to the East of the second blacke Meridian; passe downe with that blacke line to the Aequinoctiall, and looke as much East there, as <HI>London</HI> is from that Meridian above, then count the degrees of the Aequinoctiall, from the first great Meri∣dian to that place, and that distance is the longitude of <HI>London:</HI> which you may perceive to be 20. degrees and better: And the like manner of working is to be made for all other places.</P>
<P>That <HI>line</HI> full of degrees crossing both Planispheare: straight a long in the middle, and dividing the world into two halfes <HI>(viz)</HI> North and South halfes; is called the <HI>Aequinoctiall line,</HI> or the Aequator; either because it is of equall distance from both Poles of the world, or else because the Sunne comming in this Circle makes the dayes &amp; nights throughout the world of like length; which happens upon the 10, or 11. of March, and the 13. or 14. of September. It passes through Abassia or <HI>Prester Johns</HI> King∣dome, and Manicongo in Africa, through the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Island Su∣matra, and the Maldive Isles of Asia; and in America, through Guiana.</P>
<P>The use of it is to shew the Latitude of any Countrey, City, Promontory, or the like: Now the Latitude is the distance of a place toward the South or North, from the Aequinoctiall line or middle of the world; and is reckoned and measured upon the Meridian toward either Pole: Those therefore have Northerne latitude that inhabit betweene the Aequinoctiall and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he North Pole, as they have Southerne latitude that are betweene the same Aequator and the South Pole.</P>
<P>Those <HI>blacke lines</HI> thwarting the blacke Meridians from East to West, are parallels, &amp; are also called Aequidistants, being distant one from another 10. degrees toward both Poles; and are here set downe for the easier counting the latitude of any place from the Aequinoctiall: as for the <HI>latitude</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> count so many decimall parallels, till you come to the parallel which is neerest <HI>London,</HI> (you shall find them to be five) then follow that line to the Meridian, and see the figures set thereat; they are 50.) moreover, adde to that number of 50. so much as <HI>London</HI> is s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tu∣ate
<PB REF="5" MS="y"/> above that parallel, the space is one degree and a halfe; thus shall you finde the latitude of <HI>London</HI> (that is, the distance thereof from the Aequator toward the North Pole) to the 51 degrees and a halfe: and in the like manner must the Latitude of all other places be sought. Thus much of Longitude and Latitude, by which two the whole earth is reckoned.</P>
<P>The Meridian and Aequinoctiall, as also the Zodiacke, are fil∣led throughout with degrees, the number 360. and every degree consists of 60. Minutes, and containes, according to our ordinary account, 20. leagues, or threescore miles.</P>
<P>The <HI>great Circle</HI> that is drawn bending bias in one planispheare up to the Tropicke of Cancer, in the other downe to the Tropick of Capricorne, is the Zodiacke; it is replenished with degrees, and beares on it the Characters of the 12. signes.</P>
<P>The uses of it are to shew over what Countries and people the body and beames of the Sunne come perpendicular at some times or other in the yeare; and it shews to all (where the dayes increase and decrease) the longest and shortest dayes of the yeare, for the Sunne (which causeth the same) being alwayes in this Circle, and therein moving about one degree a day, all the while he is comming up from the Tropicke of Capricorne to that of Cancer, the dayes increase in the Northerne Climates; but contrariwise in his course backe from Cancer to Capricorne, they shorten to us, and lengthen to those in the Southerne Climates; and this Circle shewes the foure quarters of the yeare; Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tropicke of Cancer,</HI> (so called, or the Coelestiall signe Can∣cer) is a circle, whose distance from the Aequinoctiall toward the North, is 23. degrees and a halfe. When the Sunne is come so farre Northward as to touch this Circle, then is our longest day in the yeare.</P>
<P>It passes through the Southermost parts of Barbary &amp; Aegypt, Arabia, India, China, <HI>Nova Hispania,</HI> and the Island Cuba.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tropicke of Capricorne,</HI> (likewise so named of the signe Ca∣pricorne in the starry heaven) is a circle of like distance at the o∣ther Tropicke from the Aequinoctiall Southward, that is 23. de∣grees and a halfe. When the Sunne is gone downe to the circle Southward, it is our shortest day in the whole yeare.</P>
<P>This Tropicke passes through Monomotapa, Saint <HI>Laurence</HI> Island, Peru, and South coasts of Brasile.</P>
<P>The <HI>Articke,</HI> or North polar circle, is distant from the North Pole, 23, degrees and a halfe; so much as the Tropicke of Cancer is from the Aequinoctiall; but the distance betweene that Tropicke and it, is 43. degrees.</P>
<P>You may see it passe through Island, Norway, Boddia, Mosco∣vy, Tartary, crosse <HI>Davis</HI> S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aites, and Groenland.</P>
<P>The <HI>Antarticke</HI> or Sout<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olar Circle, is distant from the South Pole, 23. degrees and a ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e; so farre as the Tropicke of Capri∣corne is from the Equinoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>all.</P>
<P>This circle passes thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> Magellanica, or <HI>Terra Australis In∣cognita</HI> onely.</P>
<P>Now these foure lesser <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cles, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the two Tropickes, and Polar circles, doe fitly pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Earth into five Zones.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Zones.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Zone</HI> is a space of Earth, contained betweene two of the smaller circles, or within the compasse of either polar Cir∣cle: the name signifies as much as a girdle, by reason that each Zone compasseth about the earth in manner of a girdle. Of these there be two kinds, one temperate, the other untemperate.</P>
<P>There be two temper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Zones; the one North, the other South.</P>
<P>The <HI>North temperate Zo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> is that space of Earth contained be∣tweene the Tropicke of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncer, and the North polar Circle.</P>
<P>The <HI>South temperate Zo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> is that space of earth stretched along betweene the Tropicke of Capricorne, and the South Polar Cir∣cle.</P>
<P>They are called temper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Zones, for that the ayre thereof hath a farre better and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>erate temperature, and meeter for man to inhabit, than t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>temperate Zones. The breadth of them is 43. degrees a piece, which degrees, make either temperate Zone to be 2580. English miles broad apiece.</P>
<P>The <HI>untemperate Zones</HI> are twofold; one exceeding in the ex∣tremity of heat, the other as much in cold; they have bin thought in former times altogether uncharitable, but latter experience hath found them more fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for habitation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Torrid or burnt Zo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> (which is the hot untemperate Zone) is that space of heaven which you see contained betweene the Tropicke of Cancer, and that of Capricorne. It hath the name of <HI>Torrid,</HI> because the Sunne continually passes thereover, and ca∣sting downe direct rayes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ects it with a marvellous heate; there∣by making it not so convenient for the Inhabitants, as the tem∣perate Zones are. The breadth of this Zone is comprehended be∣tweene the two Tropickes, and containes 47. degrees, that is of English miles 2820.</P>
<P>The <HI>frozen Zones</HI> are spaces of Earth inclosed within either of the Polar circles: of these there are two, one North, the other South.</P>
<P>The <HI>North fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zen Zone,</HI> is that space of Earth contained within the compasse of the North Polar circle. The breadth thereof reckoned 23. degrees and a halfe, <HI>(viz.)</HI> from the Pole it selfe to the Polar circle; which of English miles is 1410.</P>
<P>The <HI>South frozen Zone,</HI> is that space of Earth compassed all a¦bout with the South Polar circle: It hath the like breadth from the South Pole, as the other frozen Zone hath from the North Pole and likewise the number of miles is the same.</P>
<P>They are called <HI>frozen Zones,</HI> because they (for the most part) exceed in cold; and that is caused in regard that the Sunne, for a good part of the yeare, is under the Horizon, and sees them not; and when he is come up into their sight, his appearance (which is for a pretty long season together) rather comforts them, than any vertuall heat proceeding from him; for there th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ayre is stuft with thicke foggy vapours, and his beames at highe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fall but very oblikely on them; so that what through his want and unability to dispel the cold, and the colds force to resist and beare backe the Suns heate; these Zones remaine almost unhabi∣table, and even (as the word is) frozen.</P>
<P>The names of all these, set in the right place of each Zone, you shall see in that Meridian going about America and Magellanica.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Climats.</HEAD>
<P>IN that <HI>great Meridian</HI> going about Europe, Asia, and Afric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are described the <HI>Climates;</HI> Now a <HI>Climate</HI> is a space of the Earth included within the space of two Parallels. The use of them is to shew the difference of length, and shortnesse of dayes over all the world, as you may see in the midst of every Climat, set the number of the houres of the longest day in the yeare, un∣der that Climat: the longest day in one Climat, differing halfe an houre from the longest in another. So that there are foure and twenty Climats, consisting of forty eight Parallels, ere the day come to be 24. houres in length, which is twelve houres longer than the ordinary Aequinoctiall day is. Now this is to be under∣stood; Under the Aequinoctiall line, and 13, degrees, that is 3. Parallels, on either side thereof, the dayes exceed not the length of twelve houres, but after in every Clime increase the length of halfe an houre, so that there are numbred (as is said before) 48. Parallels, which make 24. Climats, before the dayes become 24. houres long; the which length they being growne to, their in∣crease is then by whole weeks and moneths, till in the foure and twentieth Clime: about the Pole, the day is ful half a yeare long. And as it is thus betweene the Aequator and North Pole, so is it betweene the said Aequator and South Pole: wherefore there
<PB REF="6"/> are two sorts of Climats, that is, 24 Northerne, and as many Southerne. The Climes Northward are thus named: the first is <HI>Dia Meroes,</HI> because the middle parallell thereof passes through the middest of the Inland Jland <HI>Meroe,</HI> in the Conti∣nent of <HI>Africa;</HI> the second is <HI>Dia Sienes;</HI> the third <HI>Dia Alexan∣dria;</HI> the fourth <HI>Dia Rhodos;</HI> the fift <HI>Dia Romes;</HI> the sixt <HI>Dia Ponton;</HI> the seventh <HI>Dia Borisihenes;</HI> the eight <HI>Dia Ripheos;</HI> the 9th <HI>Per Dianam.</HI> The South Climes have the same names, save onely that the word <HI>Anti</HI> is thereto added; as <HI>Anti Dia Meroes;</HI> the next <HI>Anti Dia Sienes,</HI> and so along unto the ninth Southward: further than the ninth Clime on either side th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ae∣quinoctiall they are not named; but yet the Climes runne on both wayes to the number of 24. as is seene in the Meridian. That there be but nine named; the reason is, because when these names were given, no more than nine Climats were knowne to those of ancient times; but since though the number of them be increast to 24. the rest are not so knowne by proper names, but remaine innominate.</P>
