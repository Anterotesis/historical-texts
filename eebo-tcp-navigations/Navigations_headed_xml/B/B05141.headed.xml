<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> And the Council further considering the Inconveniences that might arise to this Com∣monwealth, by the going of Persons out of <HI>Scotland</HI> beyond the Seas, if a general liberty should be taken therein, whereby dis-affected Persons might the better pursue their wicked Designs against this Commonwealth, Do further hereby Order and Declare, That no Commander or Master of any Ship or Vessel, shall, after the Fourth day of <HI>December</HI> next, presume to trans∣port or receive aboard his Ship or Vessel, in order to his Transportation, any Person whatso∣ever (except such as belong to the Ship or Vessels Company, for whom he will be answerable) going for any Forreign Parts, not in the power of this Commonwealth, without Licence in that behalf from some one of the Persons or Authorities before mentioned, or from the Gover∣nor of <HI>Air, Aberdeen,</HI> or <HI>Dundee</HI> for the time being, upon pain of forfeiture of his Ship, and im∣prisonment of his Person during the Councils pleasure.
