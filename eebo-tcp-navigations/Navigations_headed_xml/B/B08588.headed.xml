<HEAD>A RELATION OF Captain Bull, Concerning the MOHAVVKS At <HI>FORT-ALBANY.</HI> May, 1689.</HEAD>
<P>COnnecticot <HI>Colony upon many Rumours of Hazzard, sent Captain</HI> Jonathan Bull <HI>to</HI> Albany <HI>to inform the</HI> Albanians <HI>of the News from</HI> England <HI>we had Received; and what Change was made in the</HI> Bay, <HI>who seemed much Re∣joyced; Declaring they'd allow the Fort to Remain not twelve Hours longer in Papists Hands: That being noised about, Major</HI> Baxter <HI>Declared he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Remove in four or five Days, which accordingly he did, leaving the Fort to the Inhabitants, who have placed twenty</HI> five <HI>Men in it for the best.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> there are very sure of the Friendliness of the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> and the five other Nations above them.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 24. The <HI>Mohawk Sachems,</HI> appeared in the Court-House of <HI>Albany,</HI> with a Present of Beaver of about twenty pound value, who chose their Speaker, he ta∣king two or three Skins, the rest sitting silent, Rose up and said:</P>
<P N="1">1. Brethren, we are now come as our Grandfathers used to do, to Renew our Unity, Friendship and Covenant made by us and you.</P>
<P N="2">2 We desire the House, being the Covenant and Proposition House may be kept clean, that we may keep a clean, single, and not a double heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. We do now Renew the Former Covenant or Claim that hath been made be∣tween us and you; <HI>(viz.) New-England, Virginia, Mary-land,</HI> and those parts of <HI>America,</HI> that it may be kept bright on every side, and not suffered to rust, or be forgotten.</P>
<P N="4">4. We are heartily sorry to hear of the Bloodshed by those ill minded <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>Eastward;</HI> and we now Present this Guift as our <HI>Indian</HI> manner is, to wipe the Tears from the Eyes, and the Blood from off the Relations of those who have lost Friends by those ill-minded men.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let the Tree of Love, Unity and Commerce grow and flourish, and let the Roots spread and branch forth through all our several Dominions, to stand fast that none may move it; so that we may live under the shade of the Tree, so that the Sun of Discord and Quarrelling may not scorch and wound us.</P>
<P N="6">6. We have heard there hath been several Embassyes the last year from you to <HI>Canady.</HI> that we could not be acquainted with, we do all publickly Above-board, and we desire you do so also.</P>
<P>We heard that the <HI>Eastern Indians</HI> came where some of our men were Hunting, desirous to speak with us, but we refused to have any discourse with them, but warned them to be gone, so that they came not near our Forts, but went as they came.</P>
<P N="7">7. We intend a Meeting of the Chief of our five Nations in a little time, at <HI>A∣madado,</HI> there further to consider of publick Affairs, and desire that you would send some persons from you to hear what we shall Confer of, and also some of the <HI>River Indians</HI> if they see cause, the Meeting was chiefly intended to consider what Answer to give the <HI>French,</HI> who had often sent to have Speech with them.</P>
<P>VVhen the <HI>Sachems</HI> had heard how Matters were circumstanced, in the Coun∣try, and what News was come to hand, seemed to be glad, and much Rejoiced, &amp; wholly laid aside their intended Meeting, promising neither to speak with them, nor to allow the <HI>French</HI> to speak to them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Albany</HI> say, the <HI>Mohawks</HI> shew themselves very willing to go against the <HI>Eastern Indians,</HI> if Desired.</P>
