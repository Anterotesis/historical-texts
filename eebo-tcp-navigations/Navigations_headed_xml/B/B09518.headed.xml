<P>And indeed while we Congratulate Your Excellency's Arrival unto this part of Your Government, We do but Congratulate our own Felicity, in having the Helm of the Government, by His Majesties Com∣mission, put into the Hands of One, who is Adorned with so Charming an Image of His Own Royal Vertues.</P>
<P>His Majesty hath for ever obliged the English Nation, by His Royal Assent to those Acts of Parliament, which have Enriched it with Blessings richly worth all the Expences of the Late Happy Revolu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion. But Your Lordships Most Generous, and Prosperous Conduct, in labouring to bring about those Acts hath laid <HI>England</HI> under the same Obligation to Your Lordship, that <HI>Ireland</HI> hath to Your Illustrious Ancestors.</P>
<P>From doing of Benefits to the best Island and Garden of the other Hae∣misphere, Your Excellency is now come to be a Benefactor, unto the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> and Countries that have subdued an <HI>American</HI> Wil∣derness, to be a significant part of the <HI>English Empire.</HI></P>
<P>His Majesty in His Royal Wisdom di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cerned, That the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Temper, which qualifies Your Excellency, for the most Honourable Undertakings, would best of all express His own Gracious Intentions, to this part of His Dominions. And the Prudence and Goodness, with which Your Excellency hath managed the Affairs of <HI>New-York,</HI> is an actual Demonstration of His Majesties Wisdom in the Choice of an Healer for them.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<P>The Condition of <HI>Scotland,</HI> hath been so consider'd by His Majesty, That He hath not only consented unto their Laws, which have Established their Church-Government, as 'tis now Reformed; but more than once or twice assured them of His Resolution to maintain that Church Govern∣ment among them. This Greatest of Monarchs that ever Sat on the Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and best of Kings at this Day Swaying a Scep∣ter upon Earth, hath now given Your Excellency the Command over <HI>New-England;</HI> and a People that are a Nation of <HI>Non-Conformists,</HI> which those in <HI>Scotland</HI> justly look upon as their <HI>United Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>Your Excellency expressing so much good-will as You have done to the Late Act of Parliament, which hath made the Non-conformists in <HI>England,</HI> Legal Parts of the Church in <HI>England;</HI> well knew what Hearty Friends, the vast Body of <HI>Non-Conformists</HI> are to the <HI>English Liberties;</HI> and what Loyal Subjects to the High and Mighty Prince, unto whom (under God) We are all Indebted, for the Recovery of those Liberties; and how much an Union between all Good Men, whether Conformists or Nonconformists, will contribute unto the Strength of the Protestant Interest.</P>
<P>And we believe, That Your Excellency will on all occasions express the good-will of a Common Father unto the Churches of <HI>Non-conformists</HI> (if where they bear the proportion of more than One Hundred unto One, it be proper to call them <HI>So</HI>) in <HI>New England:</HI> Churches wherein the pure Doctrine in the famous <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Church of England</HI> is Own∣ed and Preached with all possible Purity; and the <HI>Primitive Discipline</HI> which even the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> wisheth to see Restored, is practised.</P>
<P>But we cannot single out any one point, wherein w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ble Importunity more Sollicit Your Excellency's Favo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> our <HI>University.</HI> It's Languishing for want of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> us to pray Your Excellency, That You would ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch a Benign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ect upon it; as that by Your Interest and Influence, in concurrence with our General Assembly, there may be obtained from His Majesty, a Settlement of that our University, upon such Foundations as may best answer the Ends, for which both It, and the Colonies hitherto kept alive by It, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus Enlarged the English Empire.</P>
