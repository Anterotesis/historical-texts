<HEAD><HI>From Ausburgh the</HI> 19 <HI>of Iuly</HI> 1621.</HEAD>
<P>In Bauaria they take vp the sixt man throughout all the Country, and there are 26000, men to come to Straubing, where the Duke will make a generall Muster, the Ordinance and Amunition is sent the∣ther from Munchem, and the Bakers and Brewers must send Beere and Bread after the Armie, for that because the Earle of Mansfield hath sent a threat∣ning Letter by a Trumpeter to Bamberch; The Bi∣shop thereof hath sent it to the Duke of Bauaria, and thereupon hee is gone with all his Court and forces from Mouchem, and the Prince also is to send all his forces in the said Bishoprick and the rest, from Bam∣bergh on this side the Palatinate, and the Emperors Armies vnder the conduct of Monseur de Tilly, lye on the Bohemian frontiers about 2. Dutch miles from the Earle of Mansfield, who is very strong, wee shall shortly he are some newes.</P>
<P>For that the Turke is entred with so strong an Army into the field, the King of Poland also assem∣bleth all his Forces, and the Soldiers march already from Meluingh, that haue at least 160. Dutch miles to goe before they come to the place of mustering. The King of Poland is very couragious and resolute to goe against the Turke.</P>
<P>The warre now begins on all sides to haue some apparance on the King of Spain, and the Archdukes Gouernor of Brabanter side against those of the V∣nited Prouinces, for out of all the frontier Townes they go abroad to seek aduentures. They of Herto∣ghen bush with certaine Horsmen, made toward the Towne of Graue, where they tooke two Burgers, which they of the Graue vnderstanding, presently sent forth certaine Horsemen, who followed hem so fast, that before they got into Hertogen bush they did trouble them, &amp; setting vpon them, tooke both the Burgers from them, and brought sixe of their Horsemen prisoner, with them to the Graue.</P>
<P>There are 4 Ships of warre in Ostend that are pre∣pared to put to Sea, to take Marchants ships if they can, but Captaine Moy Lambert with eleuen Ships of the Vnited Prouinces men of warre, lye to watch their comming forth.</P>
<P>The Archduke Albertus dead body lyeth openly to be seene, and many men are gone thit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>o see it.</P>
<P>Two Ships richly laden with Indian wares came hither into the vnited Prouinces vpon the 18<SUP>th</SUP>. of Iuly, wherof the Mauence hath in her, 9369. Picols and 55. cases of priemsche P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pper, 176073. pounds of Clones, 271 sackes of Mace, 11398 c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses of Si∣namon, 704.¼ caracts of Diamonds.

<P>The West Indian affaires goe brauely forward, and they onely attend Saylors to put into them, that they may put to Sea, to reuenge the blood of their friends which hath beene spilt so tyranously by the Spaniards, that were so cruelly brought vnto their ends by them, and those that they threw ouer-bord, thinking to drowne them, who notwithstanding were so strong by Gods helpe, that being in the Sea they vnbound one the others hands, and swam on shore, but being taken there by the Spaniards, they were presently hanged.</P>
