<P>THe French Ambassadour hath caused the Earle of Dampier to be buried stately at Presburg. In the meane vvhile hath Bethlem Gabor cited all the Hungerish States, to com together at Presburg the 5. of this present, to discourse aboute the Crovvning &amp; other causes concerning the same Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Hungatians continue vvith roveing against these Lands. In like manner those of Moravia, vvhich are fallen uppon the Cosackes yester night by Hofleyn, set them on fire, and slaine many dead, the rest vvill revenge the same.</P>
<P>Heere is certaine nevves com, that the Cra∣bats, as also the Lord Budean, are sallen unto Betlem Gabor.</P>
<P>The Emperour sends the Earle of Altheim, as Ambassadour to Crackovv in Polen, to appeare upon the same meeting-day.</P>
<P>Novv comes tidings, that Betlem Gabor is at Thurna, there doe gather to gether great store of States.</P>
<P>The Emper. Maj. hath appoynted heere a meeting-day upon the 1. of Decemb. thereupon should appeare the 4. Proclaimed States. The appoynted taxing shall bring up a great som of money.</P>

<P>Three dayes agone are passed by, 2. mile from this Cittie 6000. Hungarians (chosen out Sol∣diers) under the General Rediserens, vvhich are gon to our Head-camp, &amp; the Enimie lieth yet near unto ours by Rackonits, though the crie goeth, that the enimie caused all his might to com togither, to com this vvayes against Prage, if that comes to passe, it shall not run of vvith∣out blovves, the vvhich might be revealed vvith in fevv dayes.</P>
<P>It continues, that in the Satser Crais are ga∣thered togither 10000 Contrie-men, most high-dutch-men, against Meissen, &amp; no Bohemians, they vvill help the King, to drive the enimie out of the Land. In like manner som certaine 1000 Contrie-men rebel in the Lentmaritscher Crais, but it is feared that those Countrie-men are starred up, through practise of the Adversarie, that the enimie in the meane vvhile might com to Prage. Wee understand, that Bucquoy hath not been in the Camp, but by the Duke of Saxen som certaine dayes, therefore vve are to looke to our selves, for feare of Trecherie. And it is thought that the Emperour vvill leave Austria to the Hungorians, &amp; see to effect his intention only uppon Praghe.</P>

<P>Writing from Marpurg in Hessen, that the Earle of the same Land, doth cause the foresaid Cittie to be strongly fortified, there on doe vvorke many 100 men dayly, and there is mu∣stered in the Earleship Zigenheym not long since 1. Governement of foote-men, &amp; 6. Cor∣nets of horse-men, the foote-men are sent to Marpurg &amp; Rijnfels. But the horse-men are lod∣ged in the Villages about the Cittie, &amp; there∣after are also mustered the Duke of Saxen Lau∣vvenburgs Governement in Tries-Zigenheym, novv further vvhere they shallbe laid &amp; used, is yet unknovvn. The fames Brothers Governe∣ment, there quarter is laid by Cassel, the Soul∣diers vvhich are taken on about Hamburg, Lu∣beck, in the Dukeship of Holsteen, &amp; Mecke∣lenburg, should also be mustered about Cassel, &amp; be used vvhere neede shall require.</P>
<P>Since the last vve cannot enquire, that there is any thing of any importaunce passed betvvixt the Matquis Spinola &amp; the Vnited Princes. We understand that the foresaid Spinola vvil lay his Souldiers in Garnisson vvith the first, &amp; deale them unto divers places, on part to Oppenheym, Altzey, Ingelheym &amp; Cruitsnach, the other part at Summeren &amp; Bacharacht, the speech goeth that there shalbe layed vvith in Ments a good Company in Garnisson.</P>
<P>The Bishop at Halberstadt, Duke Christiaen at Bruynsvvyck, doth cause to be taken on 2000 Musquetters, to send to the Vnited Princes.</P>
<P>Heere is tydings, that betvveen the King of Bohemia &amp; the Emperours folke hath beene a great Battel about Prage, but because there is different vvriting &amp; speaking thereuppon, so cannot for this time any certainety thereof be vvritten, but must vvayte for the next Post. As also of the Cittie Pilsen, vvhich the Earle of Mansvelt (so the speech goeth) should have de∣livered into the Emperours hands.</P>

<P>From Solts is certaine advise that the Em∣perours folk have made them selves vvith all theire might out of theire Camp, &amp; taken their vvay to vvards Praghe, like as they vveare then com to the long mile, but as the King under∣stand such, he is broken up vvith his armey, and com to the lōg mile beforen the enimie, vvhere they have had a very strong Battelle &amp; on both sides more then 6000 men slaine, though most on the Kings side, also hath the enimie gotten of the King som peeces of Ordenuaunce and vvaggens vvith amunitie, so that the King must retire back to Praghe, and the enimie to the Weissenberg, there he lies yet and roves from thence to the Leut Maritscher Crais unto Brix,
<PB REF="2"/>hath taken in, Trebnits, Pielan &amp; Dux, also laid folk upon Leutmarischer Slainer, and Launer passages, that the Passage upon Prage is vvholy taken avvay, and this day is com heere in a cer∣tain Person that brings tydinghs unto our Ma∣gistrat, that betvvixt Sonnevveid and Patronit, vvhere the enimie hath lien are found som cer∣taine 1000 dead Bodies, &amp; on the other side there King lay also som certaine 1000. dead bodies, vvhat is com to passe betvvixt both vve shal shortly heare.</P>

<P>Here hath beene a greate crie, that the Duke of Beyeren should have taken in Praghe, and beaten our King out of the fielde, but is not cer¦taine, for the Carle of Solms vvrites out of Waltsaxsen of the 14 of this present, that the Duke of Beyeren vvas broken up with his camp very stil, &amp; marched in al hast to Prage, though they had left som 100 men vvhich lay in theire quarter soom houres, vvhich made fires there in, that on vvoulde not have thought but that the vvhole Armay had layen there still, but as ours understood that they vveregon follovved they them presently, though the Beyerens vverd com to Weissenberge before but the 8 of this present have ours sett uppon the Beyerens by force, and fought the vvhole day togither, that on both sides are slaine aboute 8000 men, and very many should be hurt. Our King, vvith the Lord General the Earle of Hohenlo, also the vvhole army are vvith in Prage, &amp; the Duke of Beyeren uppon the Weyssenbergh &amp; Stern; vve hoope that they shall shortly be driven from thence. What further is done betvvixt them, vve look for every houre to enquire further thereof &amp; it seemes none can com from Prage, because the passages are every vvhere shut.</P>

<P>Letters out of Neurenburghe of the 20 of this present, make mention, that they had advise from the Borders of Bohemia, that there had beene a very great Battel by Prage, betvveen the King &amp; the Duke of Beyeren, &amp; many 1000. slaine on both sides, but that the Duke of Beye∣ren should have any folke vvith in Prage, is yet uncertaine, there uppon under the Merchants vvith in Neurenberge are laid many 100. Florins that the Emperour, nor the Duke of Beyeren have no folke vvith in Prage. The cause that here comes no certainty thereof, is this; That all pas∣sages are so beset, &amp; so dangerous to travaile, that it is to vvondered at, &amp; not enough to be vvrittē of, vvhat roveing, spoyling and killing is done dayly uppon all vvayes.</P>
<P>Vppon the Schanse Priests cap is strongly buileed, &amp; buy dayly much vvood lime &amp; stone, to make houses there upon, and so provide them selves for the vvhole vvinter. And are not long since in the night 500 Souldiers passed by Dure out of Gulik, so the speech goeth, there meaning shoulde be to build a nievv Schantse by Flam∣mersheym, to take avvay the passage from the Marquis Spinola.</P>
