<HEAD>A Description of the Seventeen Provinces; And of the Province of <HI>HAYNAƲLT</HI> in particular, in which is the City of <HI>MONS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Seventeen Provinces are, <HI>Brabant, Lembourg, Luxembourg, Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lders,</HI> (which are Dutchies); <HI>Flanders, Artois, Haynault, Hol∣land, Zealand, Namur,</HI> and <HI>Zutphen,</HI> (which are Earldoms); the <HI>Marquesate of the Holy Empire, Friesland, Malines, Ʋtrecht, Overyssel,</HI> and <HI>Groningen,</HI> (are Signiories.)</P>
<P>The circuit of the Countrey is about a thousand English Miles, or thirty-four Flemish Leagues. Those that formerly be∣longed to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which are now the Seven United Provinces, in these are contained 208 Walled Towns, 6300 Villages with Parish-Churches, besides a great number of other Villages and Hamlets.</P>
<P>The Beeves of <HI>Friesland</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> are very great, and weigh some of them six∣teen hundred pound weight of that Coun∣trey. The Ewes in <HI>Holland, Friesland,</HI> and part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> bring forth three or four Lambs at a time, and the Kine sometimes two Calves. The Countrey brings forth much Mather, wherewith a part of <HI>Europe</HI> is furnished; Wood, and Hemp and Flax in great abundance.</P>
<P>Five principal Rivers are in these Coun∣treys; the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Meuse,</HI> the <HI>Scheld,</HI> the <HI>Haa,</HI> the <HI>Eemes.</HI></P>
<P><FIGURE>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>The <HI>Meuse</HI> affords abundance of Sturge∣ons, so big, that some of them weigh 400, and some 420 pounds weight, and are twelve foot long of <HI>Antwerp</HI> measure. It yieldeth also great store of Salmons and Salmon-Trouts, Lampreys, Shads, Congers, Mullets, and divers other sort of Fishes, which coming into fresh Waters, become fat, and excellent good.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scheld</HI> hath divers sorts of Fishes that come out of the Sea; as Sturgeon, Salmon-Trouts, Lampreys, Turbots, Con∣gers, Shads, Mullets, Soles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and an infinite number of other Fish, that multi∣tudes of people are relieved therewith.</P>
<P>Besides these Rivers, divers Channels are cut out and made Navigable by Man's hand; the principal whereof are at <HI>Bruxells, Ghent, Bruges,</HI> and <HI>Middlebourg.</HI></P>
<P>The Countreys have many Meers, Pools, Lakes, and Marshes, which fortifie the Countrey, and furnish it with Fish.</P>
<P>Herrings come out of the Northern Seas in incredible multitudes into our Seas in <HI>August, September, October,</HI> until the midst of <HI>November;</HI> the sooner the cold begins, the sooner they come: They compass our Island of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and so pass into the Nor∣thern Ocean.</P>
<P>They have in these Countreys divers Forests and Woods well stored with Red and Fallow-Deer, Goats, Wild Boars, Hares, Coneys, Badgers, Wolves, Foxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which yield good Furs.</P>
<P>The Fowl in this Countrey are, Partridges, Pheasants, Turtle-doves, Quails, Black∣birds, and all other sorts of Fowl.</P>
<P>The People are Valiant, and very skilful Seamen: they excel in making Woollen∣cloth, Tapestry, Fustians, Silks, Velvets.</P>
<P>The Women govern all both within doors and without, and make all bargains; which makes them too imperious and troublesome. The eldest Daughter is of the greatest Reputation, yet hath no larger Portion than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st. They marry Noble with Ignoble, Young with Old, Master and Servant.</P>
<P>The Air of these Countreys is somewhat gross and moist, yet nevertheless wholsome, and fit for digestion, and very good for breeding all kind of Cattel. The Summer is fair, pleasant, and delightsome, because the Sun is not over hot: the Winter is com∣monly long, cold, and sharp. The welfare of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> consists principally in their Navigation and Fishery; which, as two inexhaustible Mines, keep and preserve them in a continual Trading, Riches, and Prosperity; employing 300 fishing Ships and Vessels, which doth employ near 9000 other Ships and Vessels, and 150000 people, that are employed on Sea and Land in the management of that Trade; and do build yearly 1000 Ships, tho they have not one Timber-stick growing in their own Country.</P>

<HEAD>A Description of the Province of <HI>Haynault</HI> in particular; it being the pre∣sent Seat of Action, in the Investing of <HI>Mons</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> King's Forces in the year <HI>1691.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>HAYNAƲLT</HI> is so named of the River <HI>Hayne,</HI> which runs through it. It is bor∣dered on the North with <HI>Brabant</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> on the South with <HI>Champaign</HI> and <HI>Piccardy,</HI> on the East with the County of <HI>Namur,</HI> and on the West with the <HI>Scheld,</HI> and part of <HI>Flanders Gallican.</HI> It is 20 Leagues long, and 16 broad; The Air is whol∣some and the Soil good, by reason that the Countrey is watered with many Rivers, as the <HI>Scheld,</HI> the <HI>Sambre,</HI> the <HI>Tender,</HI> and many other small Rivulets; there are also in it many Lakes, Marshes, Ponds, Pools, Fountains, goodly Woods, and pleasant Forests. It aboundeth with fragrant and fair Pastures and Meadows for all kind of Cattel, with good Fruits and profitable Trees; and is replenished with great plenty of good Corn. In some part of it are Iron Mines, Lead, and Quarries of Stone for all kind of Buildings, with great store of White-lime and Cole.</P>
<P>In this Countrey are 24 Walled Towns; namely, <HI>Mons, Valenciennes, Bouchain, Quesnoy, Conat, Landressy, Amesnes, Chimay, Mariembourg, Segny, Brain le Compte, Eughien Halle, Lesme, Cheure, Ath, St. Guisline,</HI> and <HI>Leaze.</HI> There are also 950 Villages, with many Castles and Signiories. Many of these Villages are great and fair, and have Titles of Honour annexed to them; as, <HI>Pequicourt, Fontayn, Laling, Montigny, Antonig, Barlamon, Barbanson, Aimeries,</HI> and many others.</P>

<HEAD>A Description of the City of <HI>MONS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE City of <HI>MONS,</HI> or <HI>Berghen,</HI> receives its Name from its scituation, which latter in their Language signifies a Mountain or Hill: but the rise of the Earth is so gentle, as it cannot be said to be Mountainous. It is a Noble City for Scituation, Inhabitants and Buildings: It is a very strong place by Nature and Art, and may be environed with Water at pleasure. The City-wall is very strong, and is fortified with three large and deep Ditches, and with an ancient Castle. The place is great and fair, and beautified with sumptuous Buildings, both publick and private, with rich Fountains, and with rich Citizens and Artists. Here is great concourse of People for Commerce. The King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Councel used to sit here, which administrated Justice to all the Countrey: All which Prerogatives gave it the Precedency over all other Cities in the Province of <HI>Haynault.</HI> It commands large and spacious Fields round about it.</P>
<P>This City is stronger by its Natural Scituation, than by Manual Industry: It is cut through on the lower-side with a little Rivulet called <HI>Truita;</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> soon as it goes out of it, falls into another somewhat bigger than <HI>Haen.</HI></P>
<P>To this City the French Forces being hastned from their Quarters, upon notice of the ROYAL CONGRESS at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and the Powerful Army agreed on amongst the Confederate Princes, in conjunction with His most Se∣rene Majesty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who are jointly agreed to pull down the aspiring Pride of <HI>France;</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King resolved to attempt something early, that he might look big with Pride once more before his fall: And on the fifteenth of <HI>March,</HI> 1690/1. New Stile, their Cavalry began to invest it in a formal manner, using all diligence to streighten the passages; and soon after the arrival of the In∣fantry, the Enemy formed the Siege with a considerable Body of Men, and pro∣ceeded hastily to break ground, and work on their Lines of Circumvallation and Contravallation, to push on the Siege before the Confederate Armies can be embodied. But it is well hoped, that by reason of the City's being sufficient∣ly Garisoned with Old Soldiers, amounting to Six Thousand Foot and Seven Hundred Horse, well disciplin'd, under experienced Commanders; of which there are six <HI>Dutch</HI> Regiments, and two of <HI>Brandenburgers;</HI> the rest being <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Walloons,</HI> Commanded by the Valiant Prince of <HI>Burgue,</HI> an experi∣enced Soldier; the City being plentifully furnished with all manner of Stores, Provisions and Ammunition, the French King may lose his aim, in endeavouring by this hasty attempt to undermine all the Councels of the Congress at the <HI>Hague.</HI> But let him call to mind, and look back to the year 1678. where our present KING (then Prince of <HI>Aurange</HI>) with the Assistance of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and other Noble Heroes of the English Nation, raised the Siege of <HI>Mons,</HI> against all the Power of the French King in that year, and relieved the City. And who knows but God by his good Providence may do the same again, by the Pru∣dent Conduct of our Auspicious King <HI>WILLIAM?</HI> whom God long preserve; and let all the good People of <HI>England</HI> say, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
