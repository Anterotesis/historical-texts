<P>The Quéene of Spaine is yet sicke. The Car∣dinall of Lerma was condemned to be tortured, and <HI>1000.</HI> péeces of gold of <HI>4</HI> crownes the peece, ta∣ken from him.</P>

<P>There are <HI>12000.</HI> Nepolitaines sent to Valto∣lina, and the Switzers and Grisons haue taken the new fortes, and the towne of Wormin.</P>
<P>The money that the King of Spaine sent to the Emperour, is conuoyed thither by cerlaine Spa∣nish Souldiers.</P>
<P>The Cardinall of Delphin and the Marquis of Cobren, French Ambassadours, are come hither, whose request vnts this Signiory is, to permit the Iesuites to reside here.</P>

<HEAD>From Vienna the 29. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> and the Marquis of Iagerens∣dorp with their armie being gone from Tirnaw, &amp; past ouer wittenbergh towards the Merke, and there haue taken in two or thrée places. Therefore our army in the Schut also is as this day to breake vp, and is to march vnder Heimburgh, ouer the riuer of Donaw, about the Marke towards Morig and Godingh, where the treaty of peace shall bée handled. There are Ambassadours come hither from Budiant to séeke for peace, whose men daily doe great mischiefe behind Newstadt, and haue burnt and done great hurt by killing and leading captiues away diuers poore people euen to Sem∣meringh hard by Stiermarke, but for that certaine aduice is come hither, that the agréement with <HI>Mansfield</HI> is sully made, the Hungarians will ea∣sily be brought into subiection, either against their wils, or be compelled thereunto by a hard condi∣tion of peace. <HI>Mansfield</HI> is legitimated, the bane published against him, disanulled, and <HI>400000.</HI> Floring payd him. The execution against the vp∣per Palatinate procéedeth forward</P>
<P>For that at this present, for certaine dayes to∣gether, it hath béene very quiet and peaceable here about this towne, and that our Souldiers with great sacks haue gone out into the Vine hils, the Townesmen and other Merchants of the wines in the country were constrained, notwithstanding that the wines are not yet ripe, to cut them downe before the time. The plague and great dearth be∣gins here also to encrease.</P>
<P>Yesterday we had newes that <HI>Bethlem Gabors</HI> forces march towards Morauia, and haue taken Stragnitz, Stagnitz, and another towne; and Co∣lonell van Walstein, that was left there to defend the passage is ouercome, and is forced to retire, and that <HI>Budiani</HI> with his forces of Hungarians and Turkes, is gone to Odenburgh, which towne he threatneth to assayle.</P>
<P>That the Marquis of Iagherensdorp hath writ∣ten vnto the Archduke <HI>Carel,</HI> and desired that hée would be a meanes to procure peace to be made within thrée wéekes, or else that the Turke hath determined to ayd <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> with <HI>50000.</HI> men, and that <HI>12000.</HI> Turkes lye ready at Canisa <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying onely for commission: notwithstanding, newes comes this day, that the Marquis of Ia∣gerensdorp with <HI>18000.</HI> men is againe on the way to Nahot in Silesia, to whom a great number of Wallouns in the Prouince of Olmitz and other country people, with many masterlesse Souldiers, are ioyned, and that he kils all that he méets with∣all that will not yéeld vnto him.</P>
<P>There is newes also this day come from O∣denburgh, that about <HI>600.</HI> of the Emperours soul∣diers that went out for forrage to Niewsiedel on the Sea, were met with by the Hungarians, and all slaine &amp; put to the sword, onely <HI>50.</HI> that escaped.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Vienna the 30. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>For that the plague still encreaseth in Rauens∣burgh, the Lords formerly named, are ridden to Nichelsburgh in Morauia, where the Cardinall of Dieterichstein lieth, to begin the treaty of peace with the Hungarians, and this day the Archduke Carel is gone from hence to News in his bi∣shopricke.</P>
<P><HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> with <HI>15000.</HI> men marcheth ouer Wittenbergh to the Marquis of Iagerensdorp, whereupon great hast is made of the ship bride at Heimburgh, that the Emperors army may goe a∣uer, and make resistance against <HI>Bethlem Gabor,</HI> and the Budiani, who still continue burning and wasting the country.</P>
<P>There are great numbers of red mice here in this country, that dee great hurt to the Corne on the Land and in the barne.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Cracow the 15. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>From Wallachia we heare that the Turke and our army lye but a mile one from the other, and that the Turke is <HI>400000</HI> &amp; our army but <HI>100000.</HI> strong, and yet feare him not, and the King of Po∣land himselfe in person, with all the Lords and Gentlemen of the Country of Podolia is gone by a backe way to the other armie in Wallachia, so that spéedily we hope for a victory.</P>
<P>The Dutch souldiers die here in great numbers by reason of the ayre hereabouts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Bundten the 25. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>3.</HI> common confederate cantons are assem∣bled together at Chur, with whom also the Trea∣surer of France hath béene, and there séeke to con∣firme their confederacy, notwithstanding that the French Treasurer earnestly desired them first to heare the Spanish Articles, but notwithstanding they procéeded therein, and concluded that all those that desired to ayd and defend their natine country
<PB REF="2"/>and to maintaine their priuiledges, they should foyne with them, and thereupon <HI>12.</HI> comunalities are ioyned with them, and it was presently conclu∣ded, that forthwith, and with all their power and forces they should ioyne together to inuade the ene∣my, as they already haue begun, to fortifie them∣selues, and daily more forces ioyne with them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Chur in Zwitzerland the 25. of Sept. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>It is certified, that for that certaine thousand Engedieners are gone to that towne. Guffier the French Ambassador went from thence in great hast, fearing to be taken prisoner.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Neiwmarke the 2. of October. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>We haue a great number of men here, but while the Generall, the Earle of Mansfied is here, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are secure enough, but God knowes what will bee done when he goes hence.</P>
<P>Here in this Country all is spolyed, for Mans∣fields army with his ordinance is come hither, where they due much hurt, and for that all the peo∣ple of <HI>40.</HI> villages, with their wiues and children, are fled and gone away, the Souldiers thresh the corne and spoile all. It is said that the Duke of Ba∣uaria with his army comes hitherward, in the meane time the treaty continues, and for that the Earle of Mansfield hath his Deputies with the Duke of Bauariaes Deputies at Cam, there are some Deputies there for the Church Ministers of the Palatinate, but because the treaty séemes not to proceed, we know not whither the Earle of Mansfield will goe with his army.</P>
<P>The Souldiers that lay in Cam, complaine that promise being made vnto them, that they should goe fréely away with bagge and baggage, as they went forth the Barvarian Carrabines fell vpon them, and tooke all that they had from them, and slew the Skammersdorp Musquetiers, that with∣stood them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Spiers the 5. of October 1621.</HEAD>
<P>All the moueables and handicrastsmen in Ger∣mertheim are carried and gone away from thence.</P>
<P>On Friday the Spaniards marched to Keisers Louteren, and on Sunday after tooke it, against the which they shot <HI>11.</HI> times with their great ordi∣nance, and will haue the towne pay <HI>1000.</HI> dollors for euery shot, from whence they went to Turke∣heim, and haue sent commissioners to Niewstadt, to open the passage (which before they held shut) vnto them.</P>
<P>We heare from Paris, that a great tumult hath happened therein, for that diuers fauourites of the Duke <HI>de Mayens</HI> that was kild before Montaubon being much griened for the death of that great man, with a great number of Sudents and other com∣mon people, went to Charenton, to be reuenged for the same vpon those of the religion, and there met together as they were comming bark, and that if it had not bin for the Duke of Monbason gouer∣nour of Paris, and other Officers of Iustice that hindred them, there would haue béene a great mur∣ther done, but they forcibly kept them backe, yet there was about <HI>8.</HI> persons slaine on both sides, and <HI>8.</HI> taken prisoners: and yet when they were parted, the people ranne to Charenton, and there burnt the Church and the Library. On Monday af∣ter there happened another quarrell betweene a Combe-maker and his sonne, whereby some men were slaine, whereupon the Magistrates fearing that if such things fell out, there would be a gene∣rall vprore in the towne, commanding the Burgers to look well vnto their seuerall wards, which being done, the trouble ceased. On Tuesday there were two hangd, that were some of the beginners there∣of, and the reupon a Proclamation was made, that no man should molest those of the religion, as you may reade in the said Proclamation.</P>
<P>From Coninxburgh we vnderstand, that the good newes touching the King of Poland, fals out contrary, and wée are certified, that there are cer∣taine thousand Polanders slaine, that the Prince of Poland is inclosed by the Turkes, as also that the King himselfe with a great power was gone to relieue him. The King is gone from Warson to Marlenburgh. It is also reported that the Tar∣tarians are already about Lublin.</P>
<P>From Riga we vnderstand that vpon the <HI>26.</HI> of September, the said towne vpon agréement made, yéelded to the King of Swethland, that hath per∣mitted all the Burgers to possesse all that they hane without any hindrance, and whatsoeuer he pro∣mised to their contentments was performed. That from thence hee went to Cockenhausen with his army, and had commanded the Russians to carry all their Merchandises to Riga, as they did before, vpon paine of further incursion.</P>
<P>From the Prince of Oranges campe, it is writ∣ten, that there is no great matter done on either side as yet, but that our men haue taken some of the enemis horses, which by sound of Drum were with their bridles and sadles sold good cheape, and that the Prince of Orange with diuers Lords, was gone downe the Rhine to Emerick, and there right ouer against the towne vpon the Véer, by certaine Engeniers hath caused a sconse or fort to be begun, greater then that which is made ouer against Rées, which already is very forward.</P>
<P>There are some Lords of Colen come hither into our army, vnto the Prince, what their intent is we know not, it is thought they would haue their Nowtraletie continued, and also about some acti∣ons touching Papenmutz, which troubles them somewhat.</P>
