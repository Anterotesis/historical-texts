<P>At Prage hath the Duke of Beyeren / before his departure / taken an inventarie of all things / also Copied the Letters in the Secretarie / sealed them to / and sent them the Emperour to Weenen / had also given command / that the Cittizens should not be ronged: In the meane while dorst no man in Prage give advise.</P>

<P>Although Trecherie / ill Gouvernment of the Souldiers / also that the Bohemians have not assisted the King of Bohemia with on accord / and more other matters / are judged to be the movall causes of the losse of Praghe / with the appendixes: yet is the chiefe causuall cause ac∣counted to bee an Indignation of God over the pertickuler rulers therof / for sinne / for now those Lords and Gentility / which formerly in high degree did use great Tyranny over their subiects the same are now dispised of them / for in the Cit∣ties they are not suffered / neither dare they com by their Subiects / of whom they are slaine.</P>
<P>And in the Satser Craits are gathered together som certaine <HI>1000.</HI> of Contrymen more / they think to defend themselves by force / if they had but a Gouvernour: and that the King / who having the chiefe Priveledges and Iuwels with him / gathering his forces againe very strongly / hath advertised them that hence forth they should be free: therefore will they assemble many <HI>1000.</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>And although som Counties in Bohemia have given themselves under the Emperours Comisioner van Walsteen / som being constrai∣ned there unto by force / others through threten∣ning: as som few dayes agone are arived heere the Emperours Comisioners / and have pro∣pounded / that this Cittie and Countie should com to the Cittie Laun / and give themselves un∣der subiection / if not / they would persecute us with fire and sword: but they have gotten but a slight answer. We hope to defēd our selves better then the other Bohemish Counties have done.</P>
<P>In the meane while is Taus / Mies / Tacha / and other Citties / strongly beset with the Em∣perours or Beyers Garisson. The said Comi∣sioners have enterprised to establish Mas-priests in certaine places / thereupon the Subiects are very disquieted / and grieved / therefore the Garis∣sons are in great danger. The Governour of Taus hath perswaded the Lord of Illa (who is Evangelist) from such a Reformation / exorting him not to Reforme the foresaid Comision of the Emperour / but to punnish the disobediente cal∣ling to mind the issue of the like former Compul∣sions. The warres will first rightly begin against the Spring: And there might arise a ge∣neral tumult / for there hath beene an uproer in the oulde Cittie of Prage against the Sedition of the Souldiers / what the issue will bee / time can reveale.</P>

<P>Concerning the victorious houlding of the field by Praghe / and the obtayning of the same (as is confirmed by Sundry Postes) is held a stately Profession / by the which the Emperour himself was present: the Cardinale of Diede∣richsten made a Sermon of thankes-giving / af∣ter the which all the ornance upon the Walles weere shot af 3 severall times / in like manner dis∣charged all the Muskets.</P>
<P>The Moravians which weere guarnished in these Landes / doe flye from the same / and doe dayly more / and more / retire towardes theyr

<P>The Earle of Thurne is in Moravia / assem∣bleth many men / and it seemeth that he wil take his course towardes Bohemia / with many thou sands of Turkes / with the which (and other more as it is thought) hee will take in hande some enterprise. Bethlem Gabor is removed from Presburgh / to Thirna / taking with him a great somme of Mony.</P>
<P>The Emperours guarde / and the like apper∣tayning unto him / are commaunded to keepe themselves in a readinesse / it is deemed that the Emperour wil in short time remove from hence / but is unknowe whether: Some thincke towar∣des Lints / or Passow / other meane towardes Prage / unto which place the Elector of Saxen / and the Duke of Beyeren would repayre / what theyre intent is / is as yet unknowne.</P>
<P>The speech is / that Bethlem Gabor would come hitherwarde to Weenen with a greate Ar∣mye / to which end the Emperour hath sent for the Earle of Buequoy / and most of his forces: in the meane time / the Moravians assemble their forces togeather: also have the Gentry of Slea∣sia cited man / for man / to be in a readinesse.</P>

<P>Also there are many thousand Hungarians assembled in Moravia / unto which place the Disperced forces of Bohemia doe repayre very strongly / and many peeces of Ornance are brought from Vlinits Zuam and Brin unto them.
