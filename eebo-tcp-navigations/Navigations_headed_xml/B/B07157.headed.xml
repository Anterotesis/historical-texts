The cause of which vnorderly proceeding, grew from this occasion: J hauing only interest in this and the fol∣lowing bookes of Amadis, haue already set out this fift booke, being the first of those which are in my hands, and also doth begin with the hystory of Esplandian, being the sonne of Amadis: intending by Gods grace to proceed with the others in due order as time doth permit. But as concerning the other Bookes which rest in another mans right, as they are not in my power, so can J make no promise when they shall bee published: wherefore seeing that matter remaines wholly to his will, I being ignorant
<PB REF="3"/> of his intent, did according to my owne fancy go forward with my owne, which may the sooner produce him to set out his: but if he should not, yet will I by Gods helpe goe thorow with mine till I haue finished all the parts that are in my hands: which are Hystories so pleasant and de∣lightfull, that it were great pitty they should lie hid∣den from your gentle sight: especially, for that they con∣taine such high matters of knighthood and prince∣ly chiualry: All which I humbly commend to your fauourable censure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. How Esplandian sleeping in the great serpent, when hee awaked, he found himselfe to bee at the foot of the rocke of the Enchaun∣tresse, and what happened vnto him.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>Splandian</HI> that had fallen asléepe in the serpent by meanes of the melodious noise of trumpets, that the sixe Gentle∣women sounded along the shoare, after he had receiued the order of knighthood, as it hath ben declared vnto you in the end of our fourth booke, when hee awa∣ked was much abashed that he saw not any of the company that were there present when the Giant <HI>Balan</HI> dubbed him knight, but found himselfe alone betwéene the wings of that monstrous beast, at the foot of a rocke vnknowne to him, which rocke was so high, that hee thought it impossible to climbe vp, but hee was persua∣ded that <HI>Vrganda la Descogneue</HI> (whose workes and enterprises were most wonderfull) had ordained it to be so, and therevpon he
<PB REF="4"/> comforted himselfe, going down into the body of the ship (where the day before that great assemblie had ben) but he found no man; and séeking further, hee went into the chappel, where hee espied <HI>Sergil</HI> his squire fast sléeping, and hard by him two old men with rols on their heads, apparrelled like Turkes: with that he went to <HI>Sergil,</HI> and with his foot gaue him such a thrust, that on a sodain he started vp, and speaking to his maister (as though hee had ne∣uer séene him before) asked him what he meant, whereat <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> began to laugh, and said vnto him: Good God, <HI>Sergil,</HI> hast thou ben in my company all thy life time, and knowest mee no better? and taking him by the hand, he drew him in such maner to him that therewith hee awaked, much ashamed to haue com∣mitted such a fault: whereof séeking to excuse himselfe, hee said vnto his maister, By my faith sir, I was so fast asléepe when you called me, that I neither remembred you nor my selfe, and I am now more abashed then I was before to think how I fel into so sound a sléepe: That cannot I tel (answered <HI>Esplandian</HI>) although as much hath happened vnto me. Then he told him that hee had slept, and when he awaked he found himselfe alone betwéene the wings of the Serpent, without any of the company that were with him when hee receiued the order of knighthood, and now (said he) we are arriued at the foot of the highest rocke that euer I saw, and withall it is so hard and difficult to climbe vp, that I can find neither path nor way how to doe it, yet haue I beheld it long, but (as I perceiue) it is enuironned with the sea in such manner, that considering the scituation of the place, I certainly beléeue it is the rocke of the Enchauntresse, whereof in times past thou hast heard by <HI>Amadis</HI> my father. And as they were in this manner speaking, <HI>Sergil</HI> heard the two old men snort (that as yet they had not once perceiued) and demanded of <HI>Esplandian</HI> if he knew them not: As God helpe me no (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) for as farre as I remember I neuer saw them before, but I iudge that <HI>Vrganda</HI> hath left them here to helpe vs if we néed. I pray you said <HI>Sergil</HI> let vs awake them: then hee called them so lowd that they rose vp, <HI>Esplandian</HI> asking them who brought them thether, but they made signes that they could not speake. It was then
<PB REF="4"/> about twelue of the clocke, and <HI>Esplandian</HI> would willingly haue eaten if he had found meat, and said vnto <HI>Sergil,</HI> Friend, neuer in all my life had I so good an appetite to eat as I haue now, but I doubt we shall find no victuals in the ship, I pray thée <HI>Sergil</HI> let vs go sée, for as I perceiue, if we trust vnto these dumbe men, we are like to fare but hardly: but the dumbe men perceiued well what he meant: wherefore going out of the chappell they entred into a chamber that ioined to the hall, from whence they present∣ly returned, bringing with them such quantity of meate that <HI>E∣splandian</HI> and <HI>Sergil</HI> were neuer better satisfied in all their liues: hauing dined &amp; the tables vncouered, they went vnto the place where <HI>Esplandian</HI> had slept, from whence hee shewed <HI>Sergil</HI> the rocke whereof hee had told him before, saying: Assure thy selfe <HI>Sergil,</HI> séeing the serpent stirreth not from hence, it is a signe that I must goe vpon this high rock to sée if there be any aduentures, and if I can bring them to an end I know not (answered <HI>Sergil</HI>) what you will doe, but if you trust to the coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell of our dumbe men we shall stay long ynough here before we haue any wordes of them. Let vs land (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) and with that hee made signes to the old men, that they should haise out the boat, where∣vnto they willingly obeied: which done, the first that entred was <HI>Sergil,</HI> then <HI>Esplandian</HI> (armed in the same armour he ware when the great <HI>Balan</HI> dubbed him knight) and rowing with their oares they made towards the rocke, at the foot whereof they descended out of the boat, leauing the two dumbe men alone in the serpent, and as they were looking for a way to get vp, they found y<SUP>e</SUP> same path that <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>Gransador</HI> had taken when they went vp to sée the strange aduentures that the Enchaunteresse had left there, and they had not trauelled long, but that <HI>Sergil</HI> perceiued his maister to want a sword, (for of all other armour he was wel furnished when hee receiued the order of knighthood onely of a sword) wherefore he said vnto him: sir, I know not whether you meane to goe, but if we passe forward, and that vpon the top of this rock, if you find any dangerous aduenture, you haue nothing to defend your selfe withall, but if you will beléeue me, you shall rather take an oare out of our boat, for oftentimes the stoutest
<PB REF="5"/> man is ouercome, not for want of courage or stomacke to resist, but for want of weapons to defend himselfe, and with that hee went backe vnto the boat, and bringing one of the oares with him, gaue it to his maister, in which maner they began to mount vpon the rocke not without great paine, the way being so diffi∣cult, the aire hote, and <HI>Esplandian</HI> heauily armed. Notwithstan∣ding they ceased not to trauaile day and night, till they arriued at the Hermitage, where the image of brasse stood with a scrole of writing at his féet (as you haue read in the fourth book) which as then they could not discerne by reason it was darke, wherfore they determined to passe the night vnder the gate, not entering any further, for it was extreame whote. Then <HI>Esplandian</HI> put off his helmet, and laying downe his shield, eate such meate as his Squire had brought with him: which done, lying downe vpon the grasse he slept till the morning that he and <HI>Sergil</HI> entered into the chappell, where they beheld the image and the writing, but neither of them could read it because the letters were in Gréek, which they vnderstood not. Then <HI>Esplandian</HI> determining to goe further, said to <HI>Sergil,</HI> Friend, it is best for you to stay here till I come againe, for if this be the rocke where my father &amp; <HI>Gran∣sador</HI> (whether it weare by fortune or willingly) did once arriue, I remember I haue heard them tell, that in Summer the aire is so whote therein that it bréedeth many venomous beasts, where∣by thou mightest receiue some harme, being no better armed thē thou art, but as for mee thou knowest I am predestined to those aduentures that other men haue failed to accomplish, which put∣teth me in hope either that I shall not liue long, or I shal accom∣plish the things that are foreshewed of me, and by that meanes shall conquer the sword and the treasure, that for certaine is said to be in an old pallace within this rocke. What, said <HI>Sergil,</HI> Doe you think that although I should die a thousand deaths I would refuse to goe with you? No by my faith, for I know that without your company life wil be irksomer to me then a thousand deaths if a man could indure so many. Friend answered <HI>Esplandian</HI> I beléeue it wel, neuerthelesse if any inconuenience should happen vnto thée, besides the blame I might receiue thereby, thy deede
<PB REF="5"/> would be more estéemed folly, then done of any courage: but not to me that haue both armor and shield to fight against the stron∣gest enemy that may bee found, wherefore I pray thée once a∣gaine doe as I would haue thée. Wherewith <HI>Sergil</HI> perceiuing no remedy, turned his head aside and began to wéepe. In y<SUP>e</SUP> mean time <HI>Esplandian</HI> laced on his helmet, and hanging his shield a∣bout his necke with the oare on his shoulder, kept on the pathes that at the last brought him to the top of the rocke, and being there hee went towards the broken castle, where hee perceiued the other Image with the table that she held in her left hand, the contents whereof he could no more vnderstand then that of the Hermitage, wherfore without longer staying he passed forward towards the chamber where the treasure lay, being continually guarded by a most great and horrible serpent: and as hee went néerer to it, he perceiued y<SUP>e</SUP> gates to be of hard stone, where there was a sword so farre thrust in, that nothing but the handle could be séene, wherewith he thought it to be the same whereof he had heard, and being moued with great desire to haue it, he determi∣ned (although he had but a staffe to defend himselfe) to assaile the beast, whatsoeuer happened thereby. And to the same end with a bold courage he set forwards, but the serpent (that as thē slept) awaked, and looking with a cruell countenance vpon <HI>Esplandian,</HI> began to hisse, and cast out fire at he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mouth as if shee would de∣uour him. Neuerthelesse <HI>Esplandian</HI> couered with his shield went néere vnto her, and with his oare gaue her such a blow betwéene the eares, that with the force hee vsed, it had almost fallen out of his hands. Notwithstanding the beast made towards him so fu∣riously that she ouerthrew him on the ground and troad vpon his belly, whereat hée was not a little abashed, but perceiuing what danger hee was in, sodainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art vp, and by little and little got to the gate wherein the sword stucke, which at the last hee laid hold vpon, and with both hands drew it to him with such force that he puld it out: and with that the gates opened with so feare∣full a noise, that presently the serpent fell dead vpon the ground, and <HI>Esplandian</HI> was so astonished that he knew not what hee did, but it was no meruel for that <HI>Sergil</HI> that staied in the hermitage,
<PB REF="6"/> farre from thence was in the greatest feare that euer he had, and besides the saylers that as then sayled along the coast, thought verely the rocke would haue fallen into the sea, so great was the noise at the opening of the gate. Meane time <HI>Esplandian</HI> lay in a swoune till midnight following that he opened his eies, when he saw a great brightnesse in the place, perceiuing the serpent dead and the inchanted sword lying by his side, which hee tooke in his hand, and rising vp entred into the chamber, in the middle wher∣of he saw a tombe shining brighter then fire, and vpon it a great lion of brasse, holding in his right paw the scabberd of the sword, from whence the great brightnesse issued, and in his left a roll of letters written in Latine, The contents whereof doe follow.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. How <HI>Esplandian</HI> hauing read the writing contained in the roll that the Lyon held, tooke the shining scabberd, and what speech hee and <HI>Sergil</HI> had together.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He fearefull cries at the time of the great constraint, shal force thee (O thou Knight that hast conquered the sword) to returne againe to conquer the great treasure wher∣by thy ioy shal be restored in such sort, that the kindled flames, by whose beames thou shalt farre off be wounded (shal bee extin∣guished, &amp; content thy selfe with this glo∣rious conquest thou hast made: for that variable fortune had aduan∣ced thee before all others, and thou hast obtained the honor wher∣vnto so many good knights could neuer attaine, notwithstanding all their Prowesse.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Esplandian</HI> hauing read and again perused the contents of the writing, for a time stood musing thereon, and in the end percei∣ued thereby, that although hee had brought the aduenture of the sword vnto an end, yet he should be constrained to attend y<SUP>e</SUP> time appointed (according to the contents of the writing) neuerthe∣lesse
<PB REF="6"/> hee knew not the meaning thereof, being as then at libertie and frée from all the passions of loue. Notwithstanding the cru∣ell Tyrant Loue, afterward obtained so great a conquest against him, that hee made him fall in loue with her that hee neuer had séene, nor neuer was in her company, as reading further in this history you shall at large perceiue. Then he laied hand vpon the scabbard, and put the sword into it, thanking God deuoutly for the grace he had obtained. After that he went diuers times about the tombe to sée if he could open it without breaking, but he per∣ceiued the christall, from whence issued part of the brightnesse to be couered with another plate coloured like azure, so wonderful∣ly wrought that it would scarse bée iudged whether it were mar∣ble, mettall, or any other stuffe: whereupon he left off his enter∣prise, and returned into the hall where the dead serpent lay, but as then neither y<SUP>e</SUP> sword nor the scabberd yéelded any such bright∣nesse as before they did, because it was day: Then going out hée went downe againe towards the Hermitage where hee had left his Squier, who being melancholy and amased at the long ab∣sence of his maister, (fearing some danger happened vnto him) was gone out of the Hermitage to séeke him, and he had not tra∣uelled farre, but hee perceiued him comming with the sword by his side, whereat he made such ioy, that being yet farre from him, he cried out and said, O my lord, blessed bee God that hath giuen you so good a beginning wherat euery man shal wonder. Friend (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) he hath yet done more for mee then thou woul∣dest thinke, and with that hee began from point to point to shew him the danger wherein he was, and being in that discourse, it waxed darke euen then when they arriued at the Hermitage: wherefore they determined not to trauel any further that night, but laied them downe vnder the next trées they came vnto, still speaking of the strangenesse of the place: whereat <HI>Sergil</HI> being more abashed then before, could not refraine to say: As God help me Maister, by good reason you may bée estéemed a better knight then <HI>Amadis</HI> your father, that came into this place, and saw the Image at the Hermitage, the writing that standeth vpon the arch of stone, the serpent, the sword that stuck in the gate where
<PB REF="7"/> you found it, and the shining tombe, yet durst he neuer proue any of these aduentures, and hée saied true, for <HI>Amadis</HI> knew well by the contents of the letters written in Gréeke, that those aduen∣tures were ordained for his sonne <HI>Esplandian,</HI> and therefore vn∣dertooke them not, but all others, onely <HI>Gransador</HI> and <HI>Vrganda</HI> knew it not til thē, but although <HI>Sergil</HI> thought to please his ma∣ster vsing such words in his commendation, yet <HI>Esplandian</HI> tooke it not so well, saying: I pray thée <HI>Sergil</HI> neuer vse such spéeches, for if the Prowesse and knightly aduentures of my Father had ben as well employed to the aduancing of the Christian faith as they were to win and obtaine honour in this world, I thinke his like would not be found, but hauing passed his youth in things so vaine and transitory, doubtlesse his glory is the lesse, not that I presume in any thing to accuse him, and God forbid I should, yet is hee knowne in so many places to bee so valiant a knight, that whosoeuer he be can second him may well estéeme himselfe hap∣py among the happiest, wherefore I pray thée let vs talk of other matters. Thus sometimes talking and other whiles sléeping, day began to appeare, when they rose vp, taking their way to∣wards the sea side, descending downe the rocke, till they came where the two dumbe men staied for them, one within the ship, the other in a little barke, wherein <HI>Esplandian</HI> entred, according to the sign the dumb man had made, and <HI>Sergil</HI> went into the ser∣pent, and with that they departed, and the barke sayled so swift∣ly, that in short space they left the sight one of the other. But we will leaue <HI>Sergil</HI> with his dumbe man, making extream sorrow to sée himselfe bereaued of his maisters presence, and will shew you of <HI>Esplandian</HI> that from this time forwards shal be called the blacke knight, by reason of the armes hee bare, who being in the little barke with his conducter, sayled so long that they took lan∣ding néere the Port where king <HI>Lisuart</HI> lay prisoner.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Enne daies and as many nights together y<SUP>e</SUP> black knight and the dumbe man sayled on the sea, not knowing in what parts they were, for if he had enquired of his guide, it had ben but labor lost: y<SUP>e</SUP> eleuenth day they discouered a great &amp; pleasant Island, where the knight being wearied with the impetuosity of the waues, desired his guide to put his barke on shoare, but he regarding not his words, thrust it néere vnto a high rocke, by nature cut in such manner, that it séemed a wall purposely made for the defence thereof: and the countrey was so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of woods and bushes, that it might be estéemed vnhabitable. Then the dumbe man shewed him a path that led him vp to the rocke, and made him a signe to goe thether, where with he issued out of the barke, armed at all points, and began to mount vp, the weather was then extreame hote, whereby the knight was so chased in his harness, y<SUP>t</SUP> he was constrained to put off his helmet &amp; carry it in his hand, till he perceiued a little Hermitage among the bushes, &amp; before it stood a high crosse, which pleased him well, not only for the hope he had to find some one of whom hee might enquire in what countrey hee was, but because hee was assured that there dwelt a Christian, and with that hée perceiued a man apparrelled like an Hermite, so old and withered that his long white beard hung downe to his girdle, carrying in his hand a pitcher of water, that he had drawne out of a fountaine not farre from thence, and was passing by when the knight spake vnto him, saying: Father, God saue you, which when the good man heard, he was in so great a mase, that for feare his pitcher fell out of his hand and brake in péeces. Neuerthelesse by little and little
<PB REF="8"/> he came to himselfe againe, and perceiuing him that spake vnto him, answered and said, My sonne, it is now twenty years past fithence I left the pleasures of this world, and forseek my natiue soile to obtaine the grace of God, and that which most abasheth mée is, that since the time whereof I speake I neuer found man that as yet saluted mee in this manner, and I thinke verely you are a stranger in these countries, or els your spéech and apparell disguiseth you much. Father (said the knight) true it is I am a stranger, brought hether by such meanes, that I neither know the country where I am, nor any man or womā inhabiting ther∣in, for you are the first creature that I met since I arriued here, of whom I might enquire, assuring you that when I perceiued this crosse it reioiced my heart, for it is the armes of the maister that I serue. What saied the Hermit, doe you then know the vertue thereof? I, answered the knight, that I doe, being well assured that vpon the like crosse our Redéemer (whereof I speak) suffered death and passion. Alas saied the holy man, you say true, praised be his holy name, that once before I die he hath giuen me the grace to let me sée a man on this side the sea that beléeueth in him, assuring you sir knight that you and I are onely the two creatures in this country that are Christians, for all the restare Pagans and idolaters. And as he would haue procéeded further, his spéech failed him, doubting that hee to whom hee spake, was but a fantasie or shadow of a man, but at the last he waxt bolder, and in maner of coniuration asked him if he were a mortall man or not? Mortall (answered the knight) that I am for certain, and withall a sinner, which displeaseth mee much, and if it abasheth you at this present to sée mee here, I am my selfe no lesse abashed to sée you: for without doubt the manner of my arriuall in this countrey hath béen such and so strange, that I can render you no reason thereof, but if you know the countrey where in wée are, I beséech you good Father tell it me to put me out of doubt. Gladly (said the Hermite) and with that he tooke him by the hand, &amp; led him to his Hermitage, and there sitting downe together vpon a log of wood, the old man began to speake in this maner, and said,
<PB REF="8"/> Now sir knight, tell mee I pray you what countryman you are, Father (said he) Great Brittaine is the countrey where in my youth I was borne and bred, I know not if euer you were ac∣quainted therewith: How long is it said the Hermite since you came from thence? It is fiftéene daies &amp; more since I was there said the knight, did you neuer know king <HI>Lisuart</HI> (saied the Her∣mite) that in my time raigned therin? Yes truly (said the knight) for I haue séene him many times: how did hee when you came from thence said the Hermite? That can I not certainely shew said the knight, for hée was lost and led away from thence, but by whom or in what manner no man cantell, notwithstanding the great paine and diligence diuers of his knights haue vsed to find him out. When the Hermite heard that, he séemed very pensiue, which the knight perceiuing, thought in his mind that hee could tell him some newes, where vpon he began to behold him well in the face to sée if hée changed colour, with that the Hermite (that well perceiued the Knights meaning) said vnto him. Truly Sir Knight, not without cause haue I enquired so much touching King <HI>Lisuart,</HI> but before I will shew you my reason why, you shal vnderstand that I am of great Brittaine as well as you, where as yet the greatest part of my kindred are liuing, whome I for∣sooke at the same time that a Gyant lord of this country married with a lady who as then I serued, and with her passed the sea, not only hoping to reape some reward for my former seruice, but (as yong men are moued) with a great desire to sée strange coun∣tries, but it fortuned, that my mistresse being forsaken of God, as soone as shee arriued in this countrey, left his holy law to receiue the law of her husband, wherefore considering with my self, that by reason as wel of my natural weakenesse, as by often frequen∣ting the company of these countrymen I might fal into some er∣ror, I determined to withdraw my selfe into this place, wherein I haue endured much paine and misery, to the great daunger of my life, by reason of the controuersie betwéene the law of Iesus Christ, which I hold, and the law of the Pagans that séeke daily to destroy it, that without the fauour of my mistresse that would not suffer them to displease me, I had not liued so long as I haue
<PB REF="9" MS="y"/> done among them, but when it pleaseth God I wil depart hence, and returne again into mine own country, now you haue heard how I haue hetherto liued, I pray you sir knight (said hee) shew mee your aduentures, and who hath brought you into this place from whence very hardly you will euer be able to returne again, but rather are in danger of most cruell death, or to indure the most horrible imprisonmēt that euer was heard of, which would gréeue me much, not only for the great beauty and young yeares that I perceiue to be in you, but for that you are my natiue coun∣tryman. Father answered the knight, you haue done mee great pleasure to shew me the manner of your life and bringing vp, ne∣uerthelesse before I satisfie your request, tell mee (if it pleaseth you) wherfore when you spake of king <HI>Lisuart</HI> you séemed so sad, which made mee coniecture that you know some thing touching him. Sonne (said the Hermit) you shall vnderstand that a dough∣ter of mine, seruant to the lady whereof I spake, not long since came hether to sée me, and told mee that hee mistresse returning from great Brittaine, whether shee went to deliuer a brother of hers out of prison, brought with her very secretly a knight of great estimation as shee said, neuerthelesse I cannot assure you who it is: but as I haue learned since, they say the two Giants sonnes were much pleased therewith, which maketh mee doubt, considering the newes you haue shewed mee touching king <HI>Lui∣sart,</HI> that he is most likely to be the man, for shée is so well séene in the art of Nigromancy and Magicke, that oftentimes shee pro∣cureth mischief vnto those that neuer offended her. And in what countrey are wee now (said the knight?) You are betwéene the marches of Turky and Gréece said the Hermite, for this moun∣taine parteth both the countries, but it is so strong, not onely by nature, but by art, that neither of the two Princes of those coun∣tries, what force soeuer they brought hether, could neuer win it. And now a Giant (sonne vnto my lady and mistresse) and one of the most strongest and puissant knights in y<SUP>e</SUP> East parts, (as ma∣ny of his neighbours, whose goods hee hath by force vsurped, and that in despight of the Emperour, or any other contradicting the same haue proued) is lord thereof. Where dwelleth hee (sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the
<PB REF="9" MS="y"/> knight?) Aboue vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> rock (said the Hermite) in a castle which he hath most strongly fortefied, and is kept with all diligence and care by a Giant one of his brethren, with others, of as good con∣dition as themselues, and which is more, it is not possible to come néer y<SUP>e</SUP> castle, but by a little path way whereon the sea continual∣ly beateth, at the end whereof there is a pair of staires cut out of the rocke, whereby you mount vp till you come to an yron gate, where a villaine, in whom the lord of the castle putteth his trust, watcheth continually, for there is no other entery, but onely the great gate that is defended with strong platformes and great Towers, in the middle whereof there is a dore so straight, that a man on horsebacke can hardly enter therein, and that way most commonly those of the castle doe vse to issue forth. Before it bee night said the knight, I meane to sée what manner of place it is, &amp; if I can I will know who it is, that was so lately brought the∣ther. God kéepe you from thence (saied the Hermite) for thereby you will either procure your owne death, or at the least perpetu∣all imprisonment. Happen what may (said y<SUP>e</SUP> knight) I wil proue what fortune it shall please God to send mee. That were but ill done of you (said the Hermite) for that men are bound to imploy their forces only in things that stand with reason and possibilitie thereby to reap a benefit by their labors, otherwise they are to be estéemed desperat fools, &amp; not valiant &amp; hardy knights aduēturing (without due respect) not only their bodies, but their souls which are of greater price, and Christ himselfe hath by example plaine∣ly shewed it vnto vs, for when the Deuil came and tempted him, bidding him doe certain things, which in déed (as he was Christ) were possible, but as be was man were impossible to doe, hee an∣swered him that hee should not tempt the Lord his God. So my good sonne (said hee) I would aduise you to desist from so vnreaso∣nable an enterprise. You may preach what you will to persuade me to the contrary (said the knight) but I must do that where vn∣to I am called, which is to prooue my selfe in those aduentures that in mans iudgement séeme impossible: otherwise those that haue foreshewed of me, should not onely haue trauelled in vaine, but bee estéemed liers and fooles. If then their sayings bee true,
<PB REF="10"/> what greater honour can I obtain then bringing most wonder∣ful aduentures to an end, I may from henceforth therby restrain the rage and fury of such men as hurt, and do iniury vnto others, contrary to the laws of God and man? And if they be found liers I had rather they shold be reproued for their want of knowledge then I accused of any point of cowardise. And if the worst fal out I will imploy my force against such accursed people, (members and ministers of the deuill) whom by the help of God I shal ouer∣come: and I beléeue and am certainely persuaded (that if I die in those aduentures) hee will receiue my soule into his heauenly ioy. The Hermite meruailed much to heare the blacke knight speake so wisely, and with so great a courage, neuerthelesse the great beautie and yoong yeares hée perceiued him to haue, moued him to so great compassion, that the teares ranne downe his eies, and therewith he saied, Ha good knight, hee in whome thou trustest, preserue thée and send thée long life, and séeing thou art resolutely determined to passe forward, I pray thée deferre the time for this night, for it is already so late, that although thou shouldest haue time inough to get vnto the gate before the sunne goeth downe yet shalt thou find it shut as it is accustomed to be, wherevpon the Knight kept the Hermite company till the next day in the morning.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IIII. How the blacke knight went vp the rocke, where by force of armes he slue three Giants, and dliuered king <HI>Luisart</HI> out of prison.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T the Hermites request the knight stay∣ed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are him company all night, who entertained him in the best manner hee could, where after they had supped, they laied them downe vpon a little straw till day began to appear, when they rose vp, and the knight hauing said his praiers in the chappell, being armed at all points,
<PB REF="10"/> tooke his leaue of the Hermite, that brought him a great part of his way, and had gone further but he feared the Giants. Wher∣fore committing him to God, hee tooke his leaue and returned. Being gone, the knight trauailed so fast, that hauing coasted a∣long the sea shore, and passed the side of a great and thick forrest, he descended into the goodliesh meddow that e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er was séene, from whence hee perceiued the castle, scituated vpon the top of a high rocke, and making towards it, hee came t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> long bridge, finding no other way vnto it, at the end whereof was a broad causie pa∣ued, with stone, &amp; the sea <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ting continually against the towers, out of the windowes hee espied two knights, one as hee thought was a Giant, the ladies sonne▪ Notwithstanding hee stayed not, but tooke his way on the left hand and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounting vp the steppes, came to a marble gate kept by a knight all arme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that before he came at him cried as loud as hee could, saying, Thou accursed wretch, the colour of thy armor fore sheweth not so much sorrow and griefe as here thou shalt receiue confusion. What deuill was bee that sent thée hether being so yoong? Meane time the knight by little and little got vp the hill, making as if hee heard him not, for hee had worke inough to looke to himselfe, the way was strait and vneasie to passe, and therefore hée bare his helmet vnder his arme. But when hée approched the gate and heard the other con∣tinue in his brauery, he answered him and said, He that is afraid commonly threatneth a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, as then b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e some, but if thou de∣sirest to know the cause o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y comming, open mee the gate, and thou shalt sée if I can satisfie thy desire. With y<SUP>t</SUP> the Porter came downe, (and while the knight put on his helmet) hee opened the gate, and looking out cried with a loud voice, come in thou vnhap∣py creature to the place where you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any straunger had good entertainement. Then the blacke knight went in, and entred in∣to a vaut, meane time the gate was that whereby the place sée∣med very darke, for there entred no light but only by a little hole that came through the rocke, and as he passed forward, the Por∣ter that was behind, staying him, saied vnto him Villaine, leaue thy armour here, and I will bring thée where the lords of the ca∣stle shall reward thée according to thy desertes. It were better
<PB REF="11"/> (saied the knight) without so much trouble to bring mee thether, in as I am, and I will follow thée. But I will not (saied he) least I lose too much by thée, for then my companion will haue thy ar∣mour, which by right is mine, and with that he lifted vp his hat∣chet, thinking to cleaue his head, whereat the blacke knight stept backe, and with his sword gaue him such a blow, that hee ouer∣threw him on the ground, and stepping vpon him, thrust him in∣to the body, and as hee had done, there entered at the gate (that went out of the vaut) a villaine all armed, who thinking to speak to the Porter, with a rude and churlish voice, said <HI>Argantes,</HI> why stayest thou so long to bring vp that accursed wretch that euen now entred at the gate? Be content a while (said y<SUP>e</SUP> black knight) I will bée there soone inough both for thée and those that sent thée, if the gates be open. With that he villaine perceiued himselfe to be deceiued, for he espied <HI>Argantes</HI> dead vpon the ground, where∣fore without longer staying he turned his backe, and pulling the dore after him left the knight shut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the vaut, whereat he was abashed, fearing to be famished for want of meat, but it fell out o∣therwise, for not long after he saw y<SUP>e</SUP> gate opened, whereat there entred a Giant armed all in gréene, who perceiuing the partie dead, and the knight that had slaien him standing by him, was in such a rage, that he saied vnto him. Thou accursed wretch, I am much abashed how thou hast thus intangled thy selfe within this place, from whence while thou liuest thou shalt neuer bée able to escape, but when thou hast indured along and most hard impri∣sonment, shalt bee constrained to end thy miserable daies with a thousand cruell torments that are prepared for thée. Art thou at that point (saied the knight) I hope rather before wee depart to make thée beare this villaine company, that at my entring spared not to threaten me as thou doest now. What (saied the Giant?) I assure thée I loued this dead knight as well as I loue my selfe, and now I find him in this manner slaine before mine eies, yet art thou not afraid to boast thereof: By my head (said hee) thou shalt déerely buy it. Behold I pray thée answerd the knight, how thy vnhappy fortune followeth thée at once, here before thy face thou séest thy friend dead, and by the same meanes thou shalt like∣wise
<PB REF="11"/> loose the soule out of thy body, which the deuill hath waited for since thou first beganst to lead an euill life, That shall soone bee séene (said the Giant) and with that they encountered, and at their méeting laid vpon each other so fiercely, that with the noise they made, it séemed tenne knights fighting together: and so long they continued the combate, that in the end the Giant waxed faint, which hee perceiuing, hauing lost the greatest part of his shield, and in a maner all his blood, hée began to flie, and the black knight after him so fast, that before hee could get out of the vaut with one blow that claue his head to the téeth hée slew him in the place. And as the knight stepped forth, hee met two Squires that came to sée the combat, who perceiuing y<SUP>e</SUP> knight with his sword bloody in his hand, asked him what was become of their guard. I haue dealt with them (said hee) as it hath pleased God to dispose? And how is that (saied they) to send them both (saied the knight) an vnhappy end of their wretched liues, that their soules might bee tormented in the euerlasting paines of hell. With that they looked in and perceiued <HI>Argantes</HI> on the one side, and the Giant on the other as yet shaking their legs with the panges of death: whereat they had so great feare, that in great hast they presently retired, crying with a lowd voice, Come foorth my lords, come forth; for your vncle and the Porter are both slaine, wherewith at the gate of the dungeon there appeared another Giant vnar∣med, very yoong and of a huge stature, named <HI>Frerion,</HI> who per∣ceiuing the blacke knight marching so boldly towards him, held the dore half shut, and with a loud voice spake vnto him and said, By my fathers soule thou must surely be some deuill disguised in humane shape, otherwise it had beene vnpossible for thée to haue slaien two of the best knights in the world, and in despight of thē to enter thus farre within the castle, but of one thing am I well assured, that what paine or torment soeuer I shall cause thée to indure, I cannot bee reuenged of the least wrong and iniury I haue receiued at thy handes. Thou brufish &amp; vnreasonable beast (said the knight) thou art surely worse thē he of whom thou spea∣kest, for that he being already iudged of God, hath neither mean to repent his wickednes nor hope of saluation, but thou to whom
<PB REF="12"/> it hath pleased God to giue sence and reason to knowe both good and euill, doest still perseuere in thy wickednesse, making of vice a vertue, in such manner that by good right I may better tearme thée a deuill then those that are wearied and waxe melancholy to haue so long attended for thy accursed soule, which I will shortly send them if thou come forth into this court, or let mee enter in. Then stay (said <HI>Frerion</HI>) and thou shalt sée how I will teach thée to preach in other sort, and with that hee shut the dore and went in to arme him, meane time the blacke knight sate downe vpon a marble stone, and he had not rested long, but the Gyant came a∣gaine, who bringing a great cimitere vpon his shoulder, would haue issued at the gate, when the knight spake vnto him, saying. Stay a little I pray thée before thou commest foorth, and graunt me one request which in right thou canst not well deny mee, for although neither courtesie nor any part thereof did euer lodge within thy breast, that habite of knighthood wherewith thou art inuested, ought more to mooue thée to humanity then thy nature of it selfe affordeth. Aske what thou wilt (saied the Giant) and it may be thou shalt be refused, both thou and I (said the knight) are now on foote, I pray thée then let vs fight in the other court, that those of thy castle may behold the pastime: which hee saied to the end that if he ouercame his enemie as he doubted not therof, they should not shut him out. By my head (said the Giant) at the first, I thought thou wouldest haue asked mercy at my handes, which would not much auaile thée: but séeing thy request is no other, I am content to graunt it, although a meanes to flie away were much more aduantage vnto thée, which these high wals will not permit thée, if thou be once inclosed within them. Thou speakest (said the blacke knight) as thy nature yéeldeth, and I as vertue bindeth me, for the rest let God worke his will. Come in then (said <HI>Frerion</HI>) and defend thy selfe from mee if thou canst. With that the black knight entred into a faire court pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d with white marble, all galleried about and supported with pillers of Pur∣phire, in the middest whereof stoode the portall that entered into the house, where an old lady accompanied of diuers yong gentle∣women stoode looking forth, to whom the Giant went, and knée∣ling
<PB REF="12"/> on his knée, said vnto her: Madame, I most humbly beséech you, that neither for good nor euill which may happen vnto me in fighting with this knight, not one of your house bée so bold to help or fauour me in any sort, for I my selfe wil put him to death with this my trenchant blade, and rising vp againe holding his shield before him with his cimiterre in his hand, he marched towards his enemy, who hauing God on his side (to whom he recommen∣ded himselfe) stood ready to receiue him. Then there began such a combate betwéen them that their blowes séemed two smiths for∣ging vpon their anuiles, séeming like fire that the wind kindleth in the aire, and surely the blacke knight had sped but hardly at that time had it not béene for the armour <HI>Vrganda</HI> gaue him, that could not bée cut by any weapon, &amp; for the good sword hee conque∣red in the rocke of the Enchantresse, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ewith hee strooke not one blow, but he drew blood on the Giant <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rerion,</HI> who neuerthe∣lesse did meruellously both defend himselfe and assaile his enemy, but by euil fortune as he thought to strike the knight on the right arme, hee started backe, and stepping forwards againe gaue the Giant such a blow vpon the helmet that hee cut away a great péece thereof together with the buckle that made it fast, but al∣though the blow was maruellous great, and in a manner incre∣dible, yet was not the Giant any thing therewith abashed, but still shewed himselfe as fresh as if hee had not fought all the day long: Neuerthelesse the blood in such aboundance issued out of his body, that the white pauement of the court was chaunged into red, and therewith he grew so weake, that it might easily be iud∣ged he had the worst, whereby he stil began to reuile, séeking on∣ly to defend himselfe from his enemies blowes, whereat the old lady that beheld them, considering her sonnes extremity, cried out and said, alas my child, is it possible I should sée thée murthe∣red before my face, and therewith in great hast shee ran thether, thinking to part them, but it was too late, for as she began to goe towards them, the Giant felde a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the ground with two blows that the black knight gaue him, one vpon the head where he was vnarmed, the other right in the middle of his leg, where with hee cut it from his body, whereat the old lady was so gréeued that she
<PB REF="13"/> swouned in the place, being by her Gentle women carried from thence into hir chamber, where they laied her on a bed, cursing him that was the cause thereof, neuerthelesse hee followed them to the chamber dore, where the old woman (being reuiued) per∣ceiuing him to enter, began againe to lament and mourne, and shedding great abundance of teares she said vnto him. Alas thou cruel knight the only bereauer of all my ioy and felicitie, art thou not satisfied yet? But wilt thou like wise haue my life and my sonnes both? Then I pray thée with spéed either execute thy wil or else depart from hence, and take what thou thinkest good, per∣mitting mee to liue the rest of my miseraale daies in sorrow and care, with these poor women: but all her intent was to make him enter into the chamber, which was so inchaunted, that no man could passe the threshold of the dore, but presently hee lost all his sences and fell downe v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on the ground, as if hee were dead, but little did the inchauntment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aile her against the blacke knight, because the shining sword had such a propertie in it, that no en∣chantment whatsoeuer could hurt the bearer thereof. Therefore the knight hearing the sorrow the old lady made, hee went into the chamber, speaking courteously vnto her &amp; said, Madame me thinkes you should take the offence I haue committed on your behalfe in much better part, considering such hazards are com∣mon vnto knights, desiring to win honour, and therefore I pray you appease your sorrow, and shew mee the knight you brought hether out of great Brittaine. When the old lady perceiued him so farre within the chamber without let, and that he desired to sée the king, she being as it were out of her wits, cried as lowd as she could, and saied, alas vnhappy wretch that I am, what haue I done, for thinking to reuenge another mans death, I haue pro∣cured the destruction of mine owne children, and therewith shee sighed in such manner as if her heart would burst within her bo∣dy, and lamenting y<SUP>t</SUP> absence of her other son, said: Alas <HI>Matroco,</HI> where art thou now? What vnhappy fortune hath thus sepera∣ted thée from thy brother and mee? Surely when thou hearest of his death, and at thy returne shalt find another lord of this castle, I am in doubt thou wilt not haue the patience to put vp so great
<PB REF="13"/> an iniury, but thinking to reuenge thy selfe I feare this deuill will handle thée in the like sort he hath done the rest, for sure he is no mortall man, for if hee were hee had found more resistance in this place then he hath done. Then speaking vnto the knight she asked him if he knew the man she held in prison, I truly (saied he) it is king <HI>Lisuart,</HI> whereof I am right sorry, being well assured that kings elected of God, (as hee is) for the gouernement of his people ought not to be vsed in that manner. Wherefore I would haue you shew me where he is, otherwise, I will doe worse then I haue hetherto done. I know not (said she) who thou art, nor by what meanes thou hast so great power, but I am well assured and I would neuer haue thought that twenty such knights (as once this day I did estéeme thée) could euer haue attained to the achieuing of so great an enterprice and much lesse to haue with∣stood my art as thou hast done, so that considering thereof, I sup∣pose that this thy power procéedeth from him in whō in my yong yeares I did once beléeue, and since that haue forsaken him, to follow the workes of the common enemie of all mankinde, who according to his naturall instinction, hath iustly rewarded me to my desert: therefore it were but folly to denie thée any thing, that art so surely defended by him to whome all thinges are obedient. Follow me then (said she) and I will shew thée the king, but as I thinke, it is not he thou séekest. And with that shee rose vp &amp; went into a darke chamber, the knight following her: then she opened an yron gate and said vnto him goe in, and there shalt thou finde the prisoner. Ladie (saied the knight) if it were to fight I would not faile to doe your commandement, but if by subtiltie I should be shut in prison, you would laugh at me that I had no more wit but to put my trust in you, wherefore goe you in first, that what∣soeuer happeneth, you may haue your part, I sée well (saied the lady) that my labour is in vaine, and all my art is nothing in re∣spect of thée, therefore I am content to doe thy will, but we haue no light to sée. Care you not for that (saied he) for I will prouide you light, and with that hee pulled of the taffata that couered the scabberd of his sword, whereby there was so great a brightnesse in the place, as if the sunne had shone therein. Then they descen∣ded
<PB REF="14"/> into a caue, where the knight perceiued king <HI>Luisart</HI> lie vpon a couch of straw, with a great coller of yron about his necke, and fetters on his legs, whereby he indured no little paine, whereat hee was so gréeued, that for sorrow the teares ranne downe his eies, yet would hee not disclose himselfe vnto him, neither once vtter what hee thought, but without making himselfe knowne, said vnto him. Noble king, you haue beene ouerlong within this filthy place, rise vp I pray you and follow mee. When the king heard him speake in that manner, hée made no other account but to end his daies at that time, wherewith he could not refraine to wéepe, and speaking vnto the old lady, asked her if she knew him: For (saied hee) since I entered into this place, I neuer saw any knight nor any one that spake vnto me, but that little sustenance I had was let downe at a hole from the top of this dungeon. Thē she answerd him, and in great despight said, Thou accursed king, if I had not knowne thée, I would neuer haue taken paines to fetch thée so farre from hence as I haue done, cursed bee the time when first I tooke it vpon mee, for thou onely art the cause of my great sorrow, and the sole instrument of my bereaued ioies. In faith lady (saied the king) I know not what you meane, and am very sorry for your heauinesse, for I neuer sought but to doe ho∣nour and pleasure vnto all ladies and Gentlewomen that desired the same, and for them haue I oftentimes enterprised many dan∣gerous aduentures, to the great perrill and hazard of my life, and if it hath happened otherwise vnto you it is altogether vnknown to mee and wholly against my will, wherefore I be séech you bee not offended with me but tell me where I am, and in whose po∣wer I now remaine a prisoner in so great misery, or by my soule I know it not, neither can I so much as conceiue which way I came into this place, only I remember that to second a Gentle∣woman y<SUP>t</SUP> a villaine would haue forced, I entered into a tent, but what happened vnto mée after that I know not, but that now I find my selfe lying on straw like a théefe with yrons on my legs. King (said she) the short time of thy continuance in this darknes hath not satisfied (as I well hoped it would) the great mischief I doe wish thée, and that for good cause, séeing that by thée onely I
<PB REF="14"/> haue indured so much sorrow, that if the heart and bowels were taken out of my body they would bee found as burning whote as flaming fire, and especially for the new displeasure I haue nowe conceiued to sée thée so soone deliuered out of my hands, being in good hope by thy long imprisonment to satisfie my losses past: but yet I am deceiued, for that fortune hath now made mee pay the vsury of my forepassed ioies, hauing giuen thée into my handes, from whence by the exquisite force of this diuell incarnate (thou art now deliuered) who hauing put to death the Gardians of this castle and slaine mine owne sonne, hath constrained mee to bring him vnto thée, which I neuer thought hée could haue done, much lesse that euer I should haue yéelded vnto his request, kno∣wing the wrath of a woman not to haue any bridle, or meanes of mittigation vntill her desired reuenge, hath wrought the effect: and so had it happened vnto thée without y<SUP>e</SUP> force of this my ene∣my, but in despight both of him and thée with mine owne handes I will slay my selfe, if my a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cursed fortune bereaue mee not the sooner of my wretched daies, Cursed bée both thou and thy King, thou now hast found (saied shee vnto the knight,) Now take him and doe thy pleasure with him I pray you then lady (said hée) vn∣lose his irons, and helpe mee to lead him vp, with that shee tooke the keies out of her pocket, and opened the lockes of his chaines, whereby the King rose vp vpon his féet, and embracing y<SUP>e</SUP> blacke Knight, saied vnto him, What great good or pleasure sir Knight did I euer doe you, whereby you should purchase this liberty vn∣to me? By my soule I sweare, that besides the honour you haue obtained in this place, you haue so much bound me vnto you, that during my life I shall neuer forget your courtesie, wherefore if you loue me let me know your name. Noble King (said y<SUP>e</SUP> knight) whosoeuer I am, I account my selfe happy if many sort I may be able to doe you seruice, as for the rest pardon mee if it pleaseth you, and let vs goe out of this caue, thanking God, that often∣times sendeth scourges vnto those hee loueth, as in his heauenly wisedome he thinketh conuenient, thereby to kéepe them in obe∣dience vnto him. The King pecreiuing well by y<SUP>e</SUP> knights words that he desired not to be knowne, and for the same cause kept his
<PB REF="15"/> helmet on his head, therefore hee determined not to mooue him any more, but with that they went all thrée out of the caue, and came into a goodly hall, when the sunne began to goe downe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. How that after King <HI>Luisart</HI> was deliuered out of prison, <HI>Matroco (Frerions</HI> elder brother) with his ships, arriued at the foot of the rocke called <HI>La Roche defendu,</HI> and of the battell betweene the said <HI>Matroco</HI> and the blacke knight.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">K</SEG>Ing <HI>Luisart,</HI> the black knight, and the la∣dy being entred into the hall, as they loo∣ked out at the windowes into the sea, there entered a Gentlewoman, and do∣ing reuerence vnto the lady, shee saied, Madame, your sonne <HI>Matroco</HI> with his ships is euen now arriued at the foote of the rock, &amp; with him great numbers of other vessels, y<SUP>t</SUP> he hath taken vpon the seas, What is your pleasure to say vnto him? When the ladie heard her shee waxed pale, and with teares in her eies, answered her and said, I would to God he were as farre from hence as hee is néere: for my heart giueth mee he will spéed in the like maner that others haue done before him, And as shee spake, king <HI>Luisart</HI> and the knight looked into the sea, and perceiuing the Giants fléet surging on the shoare out of wind and weather, among the which they knew <HI>Elizabeth Libee</HI> his nephue, and diuers others y<SUP>t</SUP> were bound in chaines, making great sorrow, but none of <HI>Matrocos</HI> men durst set foot on land, hauing already ben aduertised by some of the castle, of the great misfortune happened therein, and for the same cause staied so long without, till the Giant espied at the windowes the knight and y<SUP>e</SUP> king looking vpon them, wherewith in a great rage hée cried vnto the blacke knight whom he percei∣ued all armed, and saied vnto him: Thou accursed slaue is it thou that so cowardly hath slaine my vncle, my brother, and the porter
<PB REF="15"/> of my castle? When the knight heard him, he answerd him and said, I haue done my endeuour to make thée know, that it belon∣geth not to such as thou art either to imprison kings, or to molest and gréeue so many men as continually thou doest. By all my gods (said <HI>Matroco</HI>) fortune fauoureth thée too much, when at my arriuall I finde thée armed with the wals of this my castle, for if I had thée here vpon the shore, I would soone send thée fishing in∣to the sea as I haue done many other rash and bold fooles like thy selfe, that hast enterprised without cause to inforce my castle, but if I continue here tenne yeares together, I will neuer depart hence till I haue thée in my hands, then shalt thou know how I vse to handle such as thou art. Stay a while (said y<SUP>e</SUP> black knight) there is much more difference betwéene saying and doing, then there is distance of place betwéene thée and me. Thy threatnings make me more assured, wherefore now I feare thée lesser then I did before, and that thou maiest well know it to bee so, take thy choice whether I shall come downe to fight with thée, or thou come vp to me. Then shalt thou plainely sée to whome God will giue the victory, either to thée y<SUP>t</SUP> trustest in thine owne strength, or to mee, that trust onely in him. The greatest oxen and fattest buls are oftentimes brought vnto the slaughter as well as lesser beasts. So thou great beast, I aduise thée to remember thy for∣mer life before worse happen vnto thée, forsaking thy accursed faith which thou now holdest, &amp; with might maintainest, other∣wise bee thou assured the wrath of God will fall vpon thée, as it hath already done vpon thy friends. That shall bee séene (saied <HI>Matroco</HI>) and if thou hast the courage to stay for mee, I assure thée, thou wilt bee glad to denie the villainous wordes thou now hast vttered. Therefore cause the gate to bee opened, for séeing thou puttest mée to my choice, I will come vp to thée, were it in∣to the dungeon, from whence thou hast deliuered that villaine standing by thée, and therwith leauing his company behind him, being all armed, he began to mount vp the rocke, and went vnto the castle, but when he came to the yron gate, (which he found o∣pen, because the watch had left it and were gone) and saw <HI>Ar∣gantes</HI> lying dead, hee was in a manner out of his wits, not so
<PB REF="16"/> much for the prowesse he knew to be in him, as that he had from his youth beene nourished and bred vp in the castle by the Giant his father. Neuerthelesse hée dissembled his griefe, hoping to bee reuenged at his pleasure, and going further, in another place hee found the Giant armed all in gréene, dead and freshly bléeding, wherewith he was so moued, that he staied and stood still, and ca∣sting forth a great sigh, began to crie out and saied, alas <HI>Arcalaus</HI> my good vncle, how néere doth the losse of thee goe to my heart, wheresoeuer it had happened, but especially being done within mine own castle, wherein I thought long time to liue and make merry with thée: Alas is fortune so cruell vnto thée, that after so many trauailes and dangerous aduentures, with infinite perils, that in the flower of thy youth thou hast sustained, thou must in thine old yeares come and receiue so cruell a death within my house, which I estéemed as an assured hold and defence, not only for me, but for thée and the rest of our kindred and friends? O im∣mortall gods, what vengeance can I take vpon the Traitor that hath so much offended me, séeing that to cause him to die each day a hundred times were nothing in respect of the mischiefe he hath done vnto mée? At the least if it were <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> so much estéemed of all men or any of his two brethren, or all they thrée together, my griefe would bee somewhat eased by reason of the sorrowes I would cause them to indure. But what? Now I am constrained to fight against one alone, who by reason considring the trauell hee hath taken all this day, ought already to estéeme himselfe ouercome and vanquished: What glory then can I ob∣taine by winning victory against him? Trewly as much as if I fought against a simple woman, being (as by nature shee is) both weake and féeble, so hee vnworthy of my presence will bee much prowder if I doe but make a countenance to fight with him: ne∣uerthelesse what blot soeuer may happen vnto mine honour, of force hee must die. In this manner did the Giant lament ouer the body of <HI>Arcalaus</HI> his dead vncle, not mouing from thence, till at last hee perceiued the blacke knight that stoode to heare him, wherewith being somewhat ashamed he marched towards him, thinking without hinderance to enter into the dungeon, but hee
<PB REF="16"/> found the blacke knight at the gate that boldly thrust him backe, and saied vnto him, Thou brutish and vnreasonable beast, thin∣kest thou to enter in by force? Whereat the Giant all abashed, staied without and said, Thou biddest me to come vp, haue I thē done thée wrong to come at thy commandement? No (saied the knight) but beholding thy countenance, it séemeth thou wouldest enter by authority, and therewith stepping aside, he saied: Now come in and doe what thou canst. When the old woman (with whom king <HI>Luisart</HI> talked) perceiued thē ready to fight, in great feare she ran out of the hall, and fel downe at her sonnes féet, cry∣ing out and said, alas <HI>Matroco,</HI> I pray thée, and by the duty a child oweth vnto the mother I commaund thée not to enter into this combate, for thou knowest well that of all thy brethren, thou art onely left aliue, wherewith my heart is so gréeued, that had it not been for the loue I beare thée, thou haddest found mee now at thy returne in as pittiful estate as thou séest thy brother <HI>Frerion:</HI> nei∣ther is there any woman at this present liuing in the world, that ought (with better reason) to wish for death then I. Alas what fortune is this, that now again I must renue the sorrows, which both time and long patience (as I thought) had buried in obliui∣uion? Alas miserable woman that I am, I only haue forged the weapon that hath giuen the wound, whereby at this present I receiue this dommage, for vpon the day of my husbands decease, thinking to reuenge the griefe that my soule sustained, I haue to the contrary aduanced mine owne shame and vtter ruine, iustly receiuing the reward that belongeth vnto such, as refusing the better part thinke to remedy one mischiefe by procuring a worse vpon themselues. Madame (said the Giant) if at this present you haue receiued great losse by the death of some of your friends, ne∣uerthelesse you ought not to take it so offensiuely, séeing they haue ended their daies in honourable combate, as behooueth all worthy knights such as they were. And as for me, think you that for feare of death I will refuse to doe that whereunto by knight∣hood I am bound? No, no: likewise what reason or what excuse should moue me, being as I am both fresh and wel disposed, to re∣fuse the combat alone against one simple knight? I deny not ma∣dame,
<PB REF="17"/> but confesse that affection causeth you to vse these words, and shew the nature of a woman: but you must conceiue &amp; think with your selfe that I answere you as it becommeth me, prefer∣ring mine honour before your teares, wherefore I beséech you suffer mee to take the small vengeance I can vpon the villaine that hath so much offended mee. <HI>Matroco</HI> (saied the knight) thou reckonest before thine host, I would not for all the gold in the world lose such an occasion offered as I now haue, both for mine honour and aduantage. Beléeue mee, that neither thy mothers teares, nor the duty thou owest vnto her (as being her child) can by any meanes prolong the end of thée or me, if without dissimu∣lation thou doest not by oath promise and assure mée to liue in as good sort from this time f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rwards as in times past thou hast liued wickedly. Wherefore it were better for thée to make mee know by effect the Prowesse thou vauntest thy selfe to haue, and for me to let thée sée the curtesie, which it may bee thou shalt find at my hands if I ouercome thée. When y<SUP>e</SUP> lady perceiued that her pray∣ers could take no place she left them, and the two knights began to runne one vpon the other so brauely and with such fury, that king <HI>Luisart</HI> beholding them thought he neuer saw so cruel a bat∣tell, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> which abashed him more was, that hee could not presume how or in what manner the blacke Knight had found him in so strange a place, and yet he knew him not: sometime hee thought him to be <HI>Amadis,</HI> but when he remembred the loue he bare vnto the lady <HI>Oriana</HI> that hee had newly married, hee was otherwise persuaded, and likewise hee remembred very well the combates hee had séene <HI>Amadis de Gaule</HI> make at Windsore against <HI>Dar∣dan le Superbe,</HI> and after that with <HI>Ardan Canile,</HI> wherein hee vsed all his forces, yet were they not comparable to those of the blacke knights: who as then found himselfe as fresh and wel dis∣posed to fight as if hee had not fought all the day before. Againe when he thought it to be his nephew <HI>Esplandian,</HI> for that <HI>Vrgan∣da</HI> had foreshewed many wonderfull things of him, he was soone dissuaded from that opinion by reason hée left him with the quéen his mother, not once séeking to receiue the order of knighthood, and although that since his departure out of Brittaine he might
<PB REF="17"/> haue obtained that honour, yet did hee estéeme it impossible for <HI>Esplandian</HI> to doe so valiantly at the first. Further <HI>Vrganda</HI> had alwaies prophesied of him that the first valiant acts he should at∣chieue should be renowned and spoken of by his strange &amp; feare∣full nauigation in the great serpent, wherein he should be imbar∣ked, and for the blacke knight he knew he arriued there in a little barke vnfurnished, whereby he estéemed it vnlikely to be his ne∣phew <HI>Esplandian.</HI> But hée thought hee neuer had séene so valiant and hardy a knight, for the longer he fought, the more he weari∣ed and laboured <HI>Matroco.</HI> Neuerthelesse hee continued fighting for the space of two hours together before it could be iudged who should haue the victory, but in the end the Giant féeling himselfe wounded in so many places (his armour altogether broken, and his shield halfe clouen in two) began to mistrust his owne force. Wherefore stepping backe he staied his hand, and saied: Knight I pray thée▪ let vs breath our selues a while, and hear what I wil offer thée, which cannot bee other then to thy honour and aduan∣tage. With that the knight stood still, and <HI>Matroco</HI> began to speake, saying: I wonder (sir knight) what mooued thée to ven∣ture in this manner vpon this rocke, wherein neuer any but thy selfe durst enterprise to come during my fathers life, neither yet sithence that by his death I haue ben lord therof, and besides this thy enterprise, wherein thou hast done the thing that all others feared to doe before thée, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st also slaine thrée of my friends, whereof two of them as I thinke were the best knights in their time liuing on the earth, whereby I haue iust cause to hate thee more then any man liuing. But when I call to minde that thou hast done therein like a valiant and hardy knight, I haue some reason to pardon thée, and to estéem thee for one of the valiantest champions that euer I saw in all my life, although I haue both prooued and vanquished many others longer practised in armes, &amp; stronger then thy selfe. Wherfore if the onely cause of thy arri∣uall in this place was to deliuer the king that looketh on vs, I am content thou take and lead him hence in safety, and for the same cause likewise I quite thée of the combate, vpon condition that without long soiourning here, thou shalt presentlie depart out of
<PB REF="18"/> this castle that belongeth vnto mee. When the blacke knight had heard him, hée answered him and saied, Giant, as farre as I per∣ceiue thou estéemest it a great enterprise y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue done to come hether and find thée here within thy castle, where by mee those that thou so much lamentest haue ben slaine, but if thou knewest the maister that I serue, to whom as duty bindeth mée I am obe∣dient, thou shouldest presently perceiue and plainely sée, this en∣terprise by thée estéemed much, to bee nothing in comparison of that hee is able to doe and bring to passe, for that from him onely and none other procéedeth all whatsoeuer I haue done, whereby of good right the glory belongeth vnto him: and to the contrary you that are idolaters, serue those that are accustomed to rocke and lul you asléepe in all kind of vices, cruelties, outrages, thefts, murthers; and infinite other wickednesse, which for a time doe prosper with you, whereby you liue in honour, riches, and all worldly pleasures, and so are nulled in all filthinesse, but surely such manner of life may well bee compared to buildings erected vpon the sands, that cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontinue long, but are most sure to haue an euil end, euen then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen they are estéemed to bee at the top of all their worldly felicity▪ Like as it happened vnto <HI>Lucifer</HI> and his fellswes, whereof it may be thou hast heard spoken. Ne∣uerthelesse if thou wilt acknowledge thy former life, and of a wicked wretch (as thou hast alwaies liued) become a vertuous knight, and as thou hast been m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> cruell and inhumane, become courteous and pittifull, forsaking thy vaine and foolish faith to beléeue in my God, who is the most true and mighty Lord of all lords, I wil not only pardon thée the combate whereof thou hast the worst, but will leaue thée thy castle frée vnto thy selfe, and so wil be thy friend, vpon condition neuerthelesse, that from hence∣forth both thou and I shall imploy our forces to ouerthrow and destroy all those, that (as thy selfe) do walke in darkenesse, from whence (if y<SUP>u</SUP> wilt beléeue me) thou shalt come out. This answere of the blacke knight moued the Giant in such manner, that like a wilde Beare hee began to fome at the mouth, and saied vnto the knight. Thou accursed wretch, and of all others the most vile, doest thou so little estéem my force that thou thinkest me already
<PB REF="18"/> ouercome and vanquished? And there with hee pulled away the péeces of his shield that hung about his necke, and threw them on the ground, and taking his sword in both his hands, he strooke at the blacke knight, thinking to cleaue his head, but hee percei∣uing the stroke, stepped vnder the blow, and closed with the Gi∣ant, whereby the sword passing ouer his head, hit vpon the paue∣ment with so great force that it brake in péeces, and therewith the pummell fell out of his hand, so that the two knights being closed together, could not hurt one the other but with their fists or pummels of their swordes, whereby the blacke knight much gréeued the Gyant, before hee could finde the meanes to recouer the handle of his sword, but in the end he found meanes to vnlose himselfe from the knight, and as hee reculed backe, shunning the fury of his enemy, the old woman séeing her sonne in so great danger, went betwéene them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing most bitterly, saied vnto the knight: alas Gentleman if euer you came of woman, or haue compassion of a poore widdowes estate, I beséech you for the honour of him in whome you beléeue to pitty my miserie, and leauing me this only sonne, content your self with the death of those, that most cruelly you haue slaine before my face. Ladie (saied the knight) then cause him to aske mercy, and hee shal find it in mee, otherwise you labour but in vaine. To aske mercy of thée (saied the Giant) I can neuer be dishonoured thereby, know∣ing it by experience to bee most true, that such power &amp; strength as I find in thée, commeth not from thy selfe, but procéedeth and is only caused by the fauour of thy God, for without his helpe thou haddest no more ben able to indure against mee, then straw against the flaming fire, therefore it were great folly in mee to fight both against God and man, but I had rather (perceiuing my end to approch) aske him mercy and forgiuenesse, then be∣léeue any longer in those in whom I haue hetherto put my trust, whereof I am right sorry, so that whether I fight or sight not, or whether I liue or die I protect and make a vow from henceforth neuer to worship other then Iesus Christ thy Lord and maister. Meanest thou as thou saiest (saied the knight?) I truly answered <HI>Matroco,</HI> and therewith knéeling on the ground, and lifting both
<PB REF="19" MS="y"/> his eies and hands vnto heauen, he cried out and saied, Iesus the sonne of the virgine <HI>Mary,</HI> I most certainely beléeue thée to bee the only infalible true and liuing God, and that all others whom during my life I haue worshipped and adored, are of no power, wherfore forsaking their false doctrine to worship thée according to thy holy law, I most humbly beséech thée to be mercifull vnto me: and making the signe of the crosse vpon the ground, hee stoo∣ped downe and kissed it. Which the blacke knight beholding, for ioy thanked God with all his heart, and taking his sword by the point presented the handle to <HI>Matroco,</HI> saying vnto him: Truly valiant knight, among so many triumphant victories y<SUP>t</SUP> in times past you haue obtained, there neuer happened any one so honou∣rable as this, for that herein you haue not onely vanquished mée, but your self also, that for strength of body are inuincible: where∣fore as a victorious knight, I present my sword vnto you. It shal not be so (said <HI>Matroco</HI>) but the contrary, for I being vanquished submit my selfe vnto your pleasure, and from this time forwards dispose of me, my goods and honour, as you shall thinke conueni∣ent. I pray you then (saied the blacke knight) haue pitty vpon the poore prisoners that euen now I saw bound within your gallies, and let them be sent for hether, that I might speake with them: Withall my heart (saied the Giant) and therewith calling his mother, saied vnto her, Madame, I pray you send downe vnto the ships to fetch the prisoners that the knight desireth to sée, and let none of my men set foot on land till I send them further com∣mission, which she presently did. But when maister <HI>Elizabeth Li∣bee,</HI> and the rest of the prisoners heard the message, they made no little sorrow, thinking the best comfort they could haue would be a most miserable and cruell imprisonment, but when they en∣tered the first gate of the castle, where the porter and <HI>Arcalaus</HI> lay dead, they were somewhat reuiued, and in better hope then at the first, specially when they saw the blacke knight that came to méet them, who without making himselfe knowne to any but to maister <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> tooke him by the hand, and saied vnto him: My good friend, because I will not that any but you alone shall know who I am, I pray you in the morning come and visite me
<PB REF="19"/> in an Hermitage that standeth at the foot of this hil, where I wil stay for you, in the meane time you shall finde king <HI>Luisart</HI> in the castle, who I leaue behind me, but as you loue your life, be secret and tell him not who I am. Maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was much aba∣shed when hee knew him to bee <HI>Esplandian,</HI> and willingly would haue had more conference with him, had it not been for y<SUP>e</SUP> charge he had giuen him before, as also that at the same time a Gentle∣woman came vnto him and saied. Sir knight, if euer you will sée <HI>Matroco</HI> aliue, make hast and come vnto him, for he is euen now fallen vpon the ground, and (as I thinke is dead) hee hath lost so much of his blood. Goe (said he) to maister <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and help him what you can, for your helpe will doe him more pleasure at this time then my presence can comfort him, wherewith hee left mai∣ster <HI>Elizabeth</HI> with the Gentlewoman, and went vnto the Her∣mitage, where the night before he had lodged, but he got not the∣ther before the sonne went downe, being so weary and sore with fighting all the day that he could not goe further: where he found the Hermite and the dumbe man sitting together, by whome hee was presently vnarmed, and meat set before him, for all that day hée had not eaten, &amp; hauing supped, they laied him in a bed, where the Hermites doughter when shee came to sée her father vsed to lie, and visiting his body to sée if he were hurt, they found it much brused and blacke in diuers places, but not wounded by reason of the goodnesse of his armour, which no sword or other weapon could pierce, then they annointed him with certaine ointments that appeased the sorenesse of his bruses, wherewith hee fell on sléepe till the next morning.</P>

<PB REF="20"/>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He black knight being departed out of the castle he had newly conquered, &amp; the priso∣ners entred therein, among the rest king <HI>Luisart</HI> knew maister <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> wherfore he rose vp (sitting by <HI>Arcabonne, Matrocos</HI> mother, who as then leaned on her lap) &amp; went to imbrace him, asking him what fortune had brought him thether at y<SUP>t</SUP> time to saue the Giants life, being in so great extremity? And it plea∣seth your grace (said he) once this day I did not thinke hee would haue had so much néed of my helpe as he now hath: But as I vn∣derstand by a knight that I met going downe the hill, hee is in great danger of his life: Neuerthelesse for the honour of him that commanded mee to helpe him, I will doe the best I can. I pray you doe so (saied the king.) Then maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> caused <HI>Ma∣troco</HI> to be softly laied vpon his bed, and being vnarmed searched his wounds, and perceiuing them to bee deadly, would not for that time doe any thing vnto them but stanch their bléeding, lea∣uing the rest till hee had slept, wherein hee was newly fallen. In the meane time king <HI>Luisart</HI> not forgetting what maister <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> at his comming in had said vnto him, asked him what was become of the blacke knight: and it pleaseth your grace (saied he) as we entred into y<SUP>e</SUP> castle, I met him going secretly from hence, and not minding to returne againe. By Saint <HI>Mary</HI> (saied the king) haue I receiued so great aid at his hands, and am I so vn∣fortunate, that hee should depart from hence without knowing him? Truly I am sorry, I staied here to sée what would become of <HI>Matroco,</HI> if I had not I would surely haue followed him, and with much importunity haue craued his name. Maister <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> (said he) will you vpon your faith tell mee truly whether you know him or not? If it be so, if you will do doe me any pleasure, hide it no longer frō mée, for I neuer had so great desire to know any knight, not only for the aid he hath done me, but for the vali∣ant enterprise at this present atchieued by him. Your grace shall pardon mé<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if it pleaseth you, said maister <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> for it is true that I know him well, but if I tel you any more, I should do him
<PB REF="20"/> wrong, for hee hath expressely forbidden mee to doe it. I sée well (saied the king) you will but increase the desire I haue to k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w him, and that is worse, by the same means bereaue me of all hope euer to sée him againe. With y<SUP>t</SUP> they entered into the hall, where they met <HI>Arcabonne</HI> halfe dead with sorrow, whome the king in courteous manner praied to stay a while, asking her how her son did. He doth (saied shee) as one in whome I haue as little hope of life as of the other that lieth dead in the court, and to say y<SUP>e</SUP> truth, it séemeth that fortune hath wholly bent her selfe against me, not ceasing continually to heap sorrow vpon sorrow to make me de∣sperate. Notwithstanding I know ful wel how to bee reuenged, and that is, in despight of her and her cruelties to bereaue my selfe of life whereby shee shall lose her power, which by good rea∣son I cannot well prolong, séeing she hath not spared me one ho∣wer of rest since she first began, still playing her part in tormen∣ting mee, but of all other my misfortunes, none hath gréeued mee so much as the force of this knight, by whose power (saied she vn∣to the king) I sée thée now deliuered out of my handes, and from the cruell torments I had prepared for thée, if accursed fortune had not withstood them. Madame (saied the king) I pray you de∣clare vnto me the cause of this your great mallice towards mee, &amp; whether at any time I haue done you wrong or iniury where∣by I should deserue it: that wil I shew thée, said <HI>Arcabonne,</HI> not therein to doe thée pleasure, but rather to gréeue thee more when thou shalt know and vnderstand that I was borne and bred in the same country, wherein to my great despight thou hast raig∣ned ouerlong, for there I and <HI>Arcalaus</HI> my brother by father and mother, were both begotten and brought vp in the art of Nigro∣mancy, which oftentimes we haue practised &amp; put in effect, there∣with to torment diuers persons that neuer did offend vs. In the which art, as age and knowledge increased, I growing very ex∣pert, in the end became acquainted with <HI>Cartadaque,</HI> as then lord of this castle, with whom I grew in so great familiarity, that he married me, and with him euer fithence haue dwelt here in this castle, where not long after I was deliuered of a sonne called <HI>Lindoraque,</HI> after that of another named <HI>Matroco,</HI> that now lieth
<PB REF="21"/> in this bed, and lastly of the third called <HI>Frerion,</HI> whome thou hast slaine, and my brother also, that went to helpe <HI>Argantes</HI> the Por∣ter of this castle. And being thus married vnto such a husband as <HI>Cartadaque,</HI> was so much feared and redoubted in all places, and hauing thrée of the most valiant and worthy knights to my sons, that euer liued, I was so eleuated in pride, and so little estéemed of cruell fortune, that I thought it vnpossible for her to work me any woe. But by tract of time I found it otherwise, for by little and little shee hath wholly chaunged my ioy into most gréeuous sorrow, and wilt thou know how? Then I thinke thou doest yet remember the discord that long sithence happened betwéene thée and <HI>Childadan</HI> king of Ireland, and of the battaile wherein thou ouercammest him, where my deceased husband minding to bee present, expressely departed from hence thether, and as accursed fortune would, tooke my sonne <HI>Lindoraque</HI> with him, and hauing trauailed many countries, at the last arriued at the place where my brother staied for them, trauailing all three together with full purpose and intent to doe thée all the iniury they could, and they had scarce entered into a forrest not farre from London, but they met a knight as then surnamed <HI>Le Beautenebreux,</HI> riding in company of a Gentlewoman, that ware on her head a Cal all set with strange flowers, whome my sonne (as accursed fortune would) liked so wel, that with a great desire to haue hir to present vnto the Lady <HI>Madasine</HI> his loue, commanded one of his squires to go fetch her to him, which the knight called <HI>Le beau tenebreux,</HI> whereof I speak, would not permit, but sent the messenger back againe well beaten, wherewith my sonne being moued, thought to haue her by force, but it fell out otherwise for him, for at the first encounter the knight with one blow with his sword, thrust him into the body, whereof hee died, and as much had chanced to his vncle <HI>Arcalaus,</HI> if his horse had not saued him by running a∣way, hauing first lost foure of his fingers on the right hand. Yet fortune not contenting her selfe with this mischiefe, prepared me a worse, for my husband (who for his valour and prowes was feared and redoubted throughout all Asia and Europe) was cru∣elly slaine by y<SUP>e</SUP> same murtherer of <HI>Lindoraque,</HI> vpon the same day
<PB REF="21"/> the battell was fought, if thou canst remember it, whereby euer sithence I remained a widdow with my other sonnes as thē ve∣ry yong and tender of age, with whom I haue passed the greatest part of my daies most extreamely, wéeping and lamenting with continuall sadnesse, which had ben more gréeuous vnto mee, had it not ben for the hope I conceiued of their valour and prowesse. But to come to the point of my discourse, time &amp; reason hauing in a maner suppressed my forepassed sorrows, news was brought me of the last victory thou diddest obtaine by the Prowesse of the knight named <HI>Le beautenebreux</HI> (now as it is said, called <HI>Amadis de Gaule</HI>) and likewise of my brothers imprisonment, wherwith I was so gréeued, that respecting not my old yeares, I tooke vp∣on me to trauaile into Brittaine, hoping by some meanes to get him out of thy hands. But before I arriued there, I had certain newes of his deliuery, neuerthelesse considering with my selfe the forepassed iniuries I haue receiued by thy kinsmen, namely by that wicked wretch <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> I determined before my returne hether to finde the meanes to make him knowe that small good will I beare him. But hauing imploied all my art, and finding it in vaine to worke any further therein against him, by reason of a ring he beareth daily on his finger, giuen him by that wicked enchauntresse <HI>Vrganda:</HI> I determined to proue my skill (which could not take effect in him) against thée, being aduerti∣sed of thy often riding to hunt, with very fewe in thy company, where I made thée sée one of my Gentlewomen and a villaine that would defloure her, whom thou thoughtest to succour, and if thou now remembrest mee, I am the very same thou foundest in the pauillion, following after him that fled before thée, and there thou remainedst inchaunted, from whence wee carried thée into our barke, and without knowledge vnto any but mine owne ser∣uants, thou wast brought hether by sea, with full deliberation to cause thée languish in prison: in the meane time with the helpe of my allies and friends, thy countrey should bée inuaded, but I find my selfe deceiued. For that this place (which neuer was conque∣red by any power whatsoeuer the kings of Turkie, or the Em∣perours of Constontinople could euer bring against it, in lesse
<PB REF="22"/> then one day is both conquered and taken by one simple knight, with the losse of my two sonnes, and others, estéemed Paragons among the best knights in the world, whereby it may clearely be perceiued, that by means of thy captiuity there is much more mischiefe happened vnto mee then sorrow to thy person. While <HI>Arcabonne</HI> made this long discourse, the king that still beheld her in the face, remembred well it was she to whom hée spake in the pauillion, wherefore hee said vnto her, In good faith madame I now beléeue you better then at the first, yet mee thinketh you doe mee wrong to make mee beare the burthen of another mans offence. Thinkest thou so (said shee?) No truly, for thy imprison∣ment only had wrought great domage vnto diuers men, but to me and mine great profit and aduantage. It might be so (answe∣red the king) notwithstanding I will not cease to doe you all the fauour and pleasure that I can. In the meane time I pray you take your aduersity with as great constancy as you may. By my soule (saied she) thou speakest at thy pleasure, and therewith in a great fury (shee went into <HI>Matrocos</HI> chamber) leauing the king that had not eaten all that day, wherefore hee called maister <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI> and the other company, that meane time had prepared his meate, and sitting downe to supper, they discoursed of the talke hee and <HI>Arcabonne</HI> had together, till it was time to goe to rest, when the king went to bed, leauing <HI>Libee</HI> to guard the castle.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">K</SEG>Ing <HI>Luisart</HI> was not fully asléepe, but hee was forced to awake by meanes of a crie of women that hee heard, making great lamentation, wherefore starting vp, and calling maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and the rest of his company, he tooke a hatchet which he had laied vnder the bolster of his bed, and went to sée what it meant, and as he passed through the hall,
<PB REF="22"/> hee perceiued <HI>Arcabonne</HI> comming towards him (couered onely with a mantle) wringing her hands &amp; tearing her haire, making great sorrow. Wherwith the king went to her, asking her what she meant? Alas (said she) that which I most feared, and euer si∣thence yesterday most assuredly expected is fallen out: and as she vttered those words shee pulled out a naked sword that shee bare vnder her arme, wherewith shee meant to kill the king.

In good truth (saied hée) there is no extremitie like to that of a woman, behold I pray you with what fury she was possessed, for as I issued out of the chamber, I met her, and thinking with faire spéeches and good persuasions to comfort her, shée failed not much to kill mee with this sword that I haue in my hand: and as they beheld it, the king knew it to bee the same he wore when hee was inchaunted, which pleased him so wel, that he saied, Ha good sword, the best and faithfullest com∣panion that euer man had, how many victories haue I had by thy meanes, and what combats and aduentures haue I brought to an end with thy helpe?

And the next day when I ment to returne, the Princesse <HI>Leonorine</HI> who in my mind is the beau∣tifullest Princesse liuing at this time, sent for me, most instantlie desiring me that in the presence of quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> with diuerse other ladies and Gentlewomen, I would shew her what I had
<PB REF="24"/> heard touching the knight with the gréene sword. For (said shee) although y<SUP>t</SUP> now we vnderstand hee is named <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> yet will we not change his other name, till such time hee sendeth vs some other of his linage, or else returne himselfe to doe vs ser∣uice, according to his promise. Thē I shewed them of y<SUP>e</SUP> strange∣nesse of the Arke of louers, the singularities of the Isle, whereof they neuer had heard, the losse of king <HI>Luisart,</HI> the manner how you receiued the order of knighthood, the ceremonies that at the same time <HI>Vrganda</HI> commanded to bée vsed, the commandement that your father <HI>Amadis de Gaule</HI> gaue you to come and serue them in this place, and lastly how in the end we fel asléepe in the great serpent, frō whence we were carried, (not knowing there∣of) to the pallace of <HI>Apolidon,</HI> where when we awaked we found all our company together, (onely you,) <HI>Manely,</HI> the king of Den∣marke, <HI>Ambor,</HI> and <HI>Talanque,</HI> not knowing what was become of you. And while I made this long discourse, the Princesse <HI>Leo∣norine</HI> would not suffer me to make an end, qut interrupting mée in my tale, said vnto me: Maister <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when my cousin <HI>Ga∣stilles</HI> returned from thence, I remember that among other things by him declared, he said somthing touching the yong gen∣tleman wherof you speake; wherefore I pray you shew vs what you know of him: wherein séeking to fulfill her request, I began to shew her the maner of your natiuitie, how king <HI>Luisart</HI> found you in the forrest with the lions, of the letters hee receiued that day, what letters you had on your body when you were borne, whereof some were as white as Snow, signifying your owne name, the rest as red as blood, shewing the name of your loue, as yet vnknowne, by reason the car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acters cannot bée vnderstoode.

Truly (said she) hee deserueth no lesse, wherefore I pray you heartely when you sée him, persuade him to come hether and fulfill the promise that his father made vs, for I haue great desire to sée him, that hee might bee as much at our commaundement, as heretofore his father <HI>Amadis</HI> hath

So my lord I staied certain daies at Constantinople, speaking continually of you, that done, I imbarked my selfe againe, where by euill fortune wee fell into the hands of the Giant <HI>Matroco,</HI> who as then was vpon the sea.

And wherefore (saied maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI>) will you hide your selfe from him, Séeing there is no Prince liuing in the world, worthier then he to be ho∣noured and serued of all good knights? It is true (said the knight) but I haue done so little as yet, that I am ashamed hee should beare no better newes of mee, séeing I am in hope, that in time I shall doe great matters, which of themselues will set foorth my renowne, without the praise of other men.

Where a poore Hermite liued all alone in most strict manner, with a fewe colde roots, and not his belly full of bread: yet did hee ouercome them both, in the most vnfit time (as it may bee thought) that could bee found, for the blacke knight had indured so great trauaile in figh∣ting, and the Gentlewoman séene so many of hir friendes s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine at one time, that the one had not so much néed of comfort, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the other as much cause to rest.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. How King <HI>Luisart</HI> being aduertised by <HI>Carmelle</HI> where the blacke knight was, departed with her alone to find him out.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Armelle</HI> returned to the castle (as it is said be∣fore) went to the king, who at the same time was talking with master <HI>Elizabeth</HI> touching the wrong hee thought the blacke knight did him, in departing thence without being knowne, séeking by that meanes if it were possible to draw from him what hee knew as touching the knight: but all in vain, for the king was not so subtil to vndermine him, but master <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was as crafty to preuēt him, not intending to falsifie y<SUP>e</SUP> trust reposed in him: and although the Gentlewoman had determined to shewe the king what shee had learned of the knight, hoping thereby to obtaine her purpose. Neuerthelesse, séeing maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in presence, shée held her peace till he went away, and perceiuing the king alone, said vn∣to him. My lord, if it pleaseth your grace to shew mee so much fauour, as to assist mee in a thing, that importeth as much as my life, in behalfe of the knight, that you so much desire to sée, before to morrow at night I will shew him vnto you, if you think good, in such a place, where you may easily speake with him: and to the end you shall not suspect me of vntruth▪ I wil shew you a cer∣taine token, that when you sée it, I am assured you will easily be∣léeue me. Gentlewoman (said y<SUP>e</SUP> king) if you doe so, I wil not faile if it be possible to satisfie your request. I beséech your grace (saied she) when you are both togither, it would please you to be a mean vnto him in my behalfe to graunt me a gift that I shall ask him. By the faith of a Prince (saied hée) I will not faile to doe it, nor a greater matter then that, if it lieth in my power. Then follow me (saied the Gentlewoman) bringing him where shee had laied the sword, and shewing it vnto him, asked if he had neuer séene it. That I haue (said the king) and I would to God the knight that
<PB REF="28"/> knoweth so well how to handle it, were as néere vnto mee as it is. You shall sée him in the morning (saied she) if it pleaseth you to follow me. That will I doe (saied the king) armed or vnarmed I estéeme not whether, so I may sée him. Then be you ready (saied she) when I shall call, and let no man go with you. Content (said the king) wherewith hee went out of the chamber, and passing through the court, he met <HI>Libee</HI> and others, to whome hee saied, that in the morning he meant to walke along the rocke (because maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had certefied him, it was so goodly a countrey) and that none but <HI>Carmelle</HI> should beare him company, and fal∣ling into other spéeches, they passed the time till they went to rest, but the king could not sléepe for the great desire he had to sée the knight, whereby he was hardly fallen asléep, when <HI>Carmelle</HI> came to awake him, saying: My lord, may it please your grace to remember your promise? Let vs goe (saied hée) and there with making himselfe ready, commanded two horses to bée sadled, one for himselfe, the other for <HI>Carmelle,</HI> and issuing out of the castle, rode towards the Hermitage. And they had not trauelled farre, but they perceiued a man comming towards them in great hast, and as hee came néere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Gentlewoman knew him, asking what he meant to make such hast, and whether hée rode. I ride to the castle (said hee) to fetch <HI>Matroco</HI> and his brother <HI>Frerian,</HI> with all spéed to helpe their vncle <HI>Lindoraque,</HI> who comming to sée thē hath met with two knights armed all in white, that haue slaine his men, and (as I thinke) I left him in as great danger as possi∣ble may bee. When the king heard him, hee thought them to bee of the blacke knights company, and said vnto the Gentlewomā, I pray you stay here with this man, and I will ride to sée them, and with that hee set spurres to his horse, and taking the same way the other came, he perceiued a far off the two knights figh∣ting with the Giant, that defended himselfe most valiantly with his mare, forcing them oftentimes to recule, but the two knights as bold and nimble, handled him in such sort, that hee knew not how to defend himselfe, and if hee had not slaine one of their horses, it had gone worse with him. Neuerthelesse the knight on horsebacke seeking to reuenge his companion, was nothing aba∣shed,
<PB REF="28"/> but when the other rose vp, set fiercelier vpon the Giant then before, in such manner, that they closed, and striuing toge∣ther, sought by all meanes to vnhorse each other. Mean time the knight on foot, went vnto the Giant, and taking him by the left leg, pulled him by such force, that both hee and the other knight fell off their horses, and holding each other fast, the Giant fell vnder with his face vpwards, wherewith the knight that threw him downe, thrust him into the face, that hee was constrained to let goe his hold, neuerthelesse rising vp againe with great force, and laying hold vpon the knight that had so wounded him, hee threw him on the ground, meane time the other gaue the Giant such a blow vpon the head, that hée began to réele, and therewith stretching out his legs, yéelded vp the ghost. With that the king rode somewhat néerer, and perceiued the two knights to beare black crosses, that shewed thē to be Christians, wherefore riding boldly vnto them, hee went so néere that they knew him, where∣vpon they went to doe him honour, much abashed to sée him. But the king perceiuing the honour they did him, was no lesse aba∣shed, and saied vnto them: My good friendes, I know you not, I pray you put off your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ets that I may sée your faces, which they did, whereby he knew the one to bee <HI>Talanque</HI> sonne of <HI>Ga∣laor,</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> other <HI>Ambor de G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>el,</HI> sonne of <HI>Angriote destrauaulx;</HI> whō he friendly imbraced, &amp; saied vnto them, In faith my good friends, it is not without cause if it liketh you well to sée mee here, for all my life haue I desired the companies of your fathers, the like doe I of their children, wherefore for the loue of God I pray you shew mee what straunge aduenture hath brought you into this country. And it pleaseth your grace (said <HI>Talanque</HI>) we séeke after a knight armed all in blacke, of whome as yet wee can heare no newes. Doe you know his name (said the king?) That wee doe (said <HI>Ambor</HI>) for it is your nephew <HI>Esplandian:</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> contents me (said the king) doe but follow mee, and I will bring you where hee is. With that <HI>Ambor,</HI> who before was alighted to honour the king, mounted againe on horsebacke, and <HI>Talanque</HI> on the Giants horse, for his owne was slaine, and all thrée together rode y<SUP>e</SUP> way the king came thether, till such time they espied the Gentlewo∣man,
<PB REF="29"/> that staid for him: who perceiuing them to ride in such hast towards her, was in mind to haue fled away, fearing they had taken the king, and forcibly had him with them, but perceiuing them by their gestures to be his friends, shée staied till they came vnto her, saying to the king. My lord, where hath your grace got∣ten company so soone? Gentlewoman (said he) you shall know it all in good time, but what haue you done (saied hee) with the man that I left with you? Let vs know what newes he hath told you. Truly (said she) I had no sooner assured him of the death of <HI>Ma∣troco</HI> and the rest of the castle, but hee fled ouer this hill, as if all the deuils in hell had ben behind him: yet he tolde mée that the Giant his maister had heard some rumour thereof, and for the same cause was comming to the castle to know the truth, accom∣panied only with two knights, y<SUP>t</SUP> he caused to ride before him, but to their hard fortunes, for he found them both slain, not knowing who had done it, but only that not long after hee met with two strange knights, that assailed him, and left them fighting (as hee saied) together. By God (saied the king) if the first two knights sped hardly, their maister that followed after them had little bet∣ter entertainement, for they are all slain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon the way, and here are the knights that did it, whome I pray you let vs take with vs, for they are friends and companion vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> knight you haue promised to shew me. Let vs goe then (saied shée) séeing it is your graces pleasure: and therewith they rode vnto the Hermitage, at the entery whereof, they found the Hermite set vpon a stone, who being abashed to sée his doughter in such company, asked whether shee went. Father (saied shee) here is king <HI>Luisart</HI> your Prince and mine, whom I haue brought to sée you. And although the Hermite had not séen him in long time before, yet he present∣ly knew him, where with hee stepped to kisse his féete, which the king would not suffer him to doe, but imbraced him, and lighting off his horse, followed the Gentlewoman, till hée met the dumbe man, that hearing the noise and trampling of horses, came to see who they were, and perceiuing the king, hee bowed his head be∣fore him. Neuerthelesse the king went forward, not staying to speake vnto him, entring presently after <HI>Carmelle</HI> into the cham∣ber,
<PB REF="29"/> where he found the knight set vpon the beds side. Wherwith <HI>Esplandian</HI> presently knew him, and knéeled downe before him, but the king taking him vp, wéeping for ioy imbraced him. With that <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor</HI> entred in, and perceiuing their com∣panion (that they so long had sought) were maruellous glad, and comming to imbrace him, the king said to <HI>Esplandian:</HI> My sonne, although you haue sought by all meanes to hide your selfe from vs, yet God hath so wrought, that at one instant we haue al thrée found you out: wherefore I pray you let vs depart hence, and go with vs vnto the castle, where you shall bee better at your ease then in this simple Hermitage. My lord (saied hee) I am at your commaundement, with that hee went to imbrace <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor,</HI> asking them (and they him) what had happened vnto thē since <HI>Vrganda</HI> caused them to be dubbed knights. By Gods helpe (said the king) you shall stay to he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sequell vntill wee bee in the castle, for then you shall haue better leisure to declare the same. With that he called <HI>Carmelle,</HI> willing her to returne with all dilligence to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and commaund <HI>Libee</HI> to bring one of <HI>Matrocos</HI> horses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>spla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ian.</HI> My lord (saied <HI>Ambor</HI>) it will bee late before he common hether, he sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> rather haue my horse, and I will goe on foote, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall not (saied the king) get you vpon <HI>Carmelles</HI> horse, and let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sit vp behind you. In which manner they road vnto the castle after whom the Hermite and the dumb man followed as fast as they could. But they scarce alighted off their horses, <HI>Ambor</HI> and <HI>Talanque</HI> being vnarmed, but <HI>Carmelle</HI> moued with the extreame passions of loue she bare vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> blacke knight, had almost slaine her selfe with the sword that the day be∣fore she had stollen from him, the occasion wherof procéeded from a conceit y<SUP>t</SUP> he would disdaine her as vnworthy of him, hee being the sonne of <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> as shee vnderstood: yet in the end she remembred the promise the king had made, wherefore she de∣termined to desire so much of him, to be a meanes vnto <HI>Esplandi∣an,</HI> that he would graunt she might neuer be absent from him, but would serue him during her life with all fidelitie, and to the same end, putting her determination in effect, as they sat all together, she knéeled before the king, and saied. My lord, now your grace
<PB REF="30"/> séeth I haue kept my promise. That is true (saied he) and while I liue I will not be vnmindfull of it. My lord (said shée) then I trust your grace hath not forgotten the gift you promised mee: and to performe your word, I pray you be a meanes to the black knight that hee will graunt mee my request. Gentlewomen (saied the king) bee you assured I will doe it with all my heart. Your grace (saied she) as yesterday gaue mee leaue to visite my father in the Hermitage, who as it fortuned when I came thether was gone forth, whereat I was abashed, because he neuer vsed to bee farre from thence: And finding the dore open, I went into a chamber (that I caused to bee furnished) wherein sometimes I vse to lie, when time or foule weather would not permit me to returne vn∣to the castle, where I found this knight (pointing to <HI>Esplandian</HI>) which you all so much desired to sée, fast sléeping, his sword han∣ging at his beds head, where with not long sit hence he hath slaine those, that from my infancy ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brought the vp, and being moued by reason of my no little losse, with a desir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to reuenge both my selfe and my friendes, I though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o kill him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d was so neere the point to execute my will, that as I held the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> drawne in my hand, and began to lift vp mine arme to gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the blow, he séemed so faire within mine eie, that sudd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y I was surprised with loue, and that so feruently, that were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not for the promise you haue made me, I had not ben aliue at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> present time. Neuer∣thelesse hauing sithence vnderstood, that hee by whome I am in this extremitie, in estate and degrée▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot to bee my equall, where∣by I perceiue my selfe vnworthy ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er to be wife or companion vnto him, I haue somewhat moderated my first deliberation in such manner, that I will hold my selfe more then satisfied, if it please him I may only continue w<SUP>t</SUP> him, to serue at his comman∣dement during my life, which in reason he cannot well deny me, for let him doe what hee will, so long as life is in my body, I will neuer forsake him, if I be not constrained therevnto. Wherefore my lord, for the honour of God, I beséech your grace to finde the meanes my poore request may once bée granted, and you Gentle∣men (saied she to <HI>Ambor</HI> and <HI>Talanque</HI>) I pray you put to your helps, that by your fauours the life of me poore louer, not beloued,
<PB REF="30"/> may bee prolonged. The king hearing the Gentlewoman (that while she spake sometime blushed, and other whiles waxed pale) make this discourse, could hardly abstain to laugh, thinking how inconsiderately shee had fallen into so great extremitie, whereby hee feared if hée should make an answere other then pleased her, she would kill her selfe, but with courteous spéech hee saied vnto her: Gentlewoman, your request is so reasonable, that I am of opinion hee will not deny it: and for my part, I will intreat him as much as possible I can. My lord (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) I wil do what your grace commaundeth. Graunt her then I pray you (saied the king) what shée craueth at your hands, that from henceforth shee may bee called your faithfull seruant, her honour alwaies saued, as in knighthood you are bound. I will doe it, answered <HI>Esplandi∣an,</HI> and thereof I assure you (saied hee) speaking to <HI>Carmelle,</HI> who knéeling on the ground kissed his féete, and thanked the king and him most heartely, reputing he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> selfe most happy, in obtaining so great fauour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI How <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor</HI> shewed the king what aduentures they had found seeking for <HI>Esplandian</HI> their companion, after they had receiued the order of knighthood.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Ou heard before in what sort king <HI>Luisart</HI> was deliuered out of prison by his nephew <HI>Esplan∣dian,</HI> but as yet he knew not the manner how he receiued the order of knighthood. Where∣fore as they rose from dinner, the king desi∣red him to tell him how he was made knight, as also what happened vnto him since that time, to the end (saied hée) that <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor</HI> may doe the like. Then <HI>Esplandian</HI> tolde how <HI>Vrganda</HI> came vnto the Ferme island in the great serpent, what spéech shee had with <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> and others that were with him, the order shee vsed to dub him knight, together with <HI>Talanque, Ambor, Manely,</HI> &amp; the king
<PB REF="31"/> of Denmarke: The sléepe wherein they fell, and that when hee awaked, he found himselfe at the foot of the rocke of the Enchan∣tresse, in company of <HI>Sergil</HI> his Squire and two dumb men, also how he conquered the sword, with his arriuall at the mountain, where he found the Hermite, that dissuaded him from fighting with the giants. By my head (said the king) I neuer heard stran∣ger things, And now <HI>Ambor</HI> (saied hee) what became of you? My lord (saied <HI>Ambor</HI>) my companion and I were likewise asléepe, and when we awaked we found our selues in a little barke with our two horses, in a Hauen of the sea called <HI>Armata</HI> in the coun∣try of Norway (as then vnknowne to vs) where wee landed be∣fore a towne, not only to know in what countrey wee were, but also to séeke for victuals. And as wee went towards it, the watch of the towne (by reason of certain dissension not long before mo∣ued betwéene them and their neighbours) sent to knowe what we would haue. Wherewith we made them answere, wée were knights aduenturous that came from the Ferme Isle, cast vpon that shore by tempest of weather. In good truth said he that spake vnto vs, our king hath so great cause to vse your helpes, that if you goe vnto him, I am well assured hee will bid you welcome. We asked him the kings name, and what country wee were in. My lords (said he) the country is called Norway, wherof <HI>Adroni</HI> father in lawe to <HI>Agraies,</HI> sonne to the king of Scots, and one of the best knights in the world, is our king, I know not whether you know him. And what cause saied wee, hath your king to vse our helpe? I will tell you (said he) he is so old, that one of his ne∣phewes, his sisters sonne, (procured therevnto by euil counsel) is risen in armes against him, séeking to haue the gouernement of the countrey, in respect (as hee saith) his vncle is no more able to rule the same. And vnder that pretence hath already vsurped a great part thereof, and now lieth in campe before one of the best citties in this land, which the king by no meanes can reléeue, by reason that most of his trustiest friends haue forsaken him, and hold with the yoong presumptuous foole, that winneth them by faire promises, a thing that oftentimes happeneth vnto such as fortune fauoureth not, and when men are fallen, they are not
<PB REF="31"/> only abandoned of straungers, but by their owne kindred and friends, that properly may be tearmed friends for y<SUP>e</SUP> present time. In good faith said we, if the towne will giue vs victuals, and one to guide vs, we will gladly goe and present our seruice vnto him, not onely for the loue of <HI>Agraies,</HI> to whom wee are companions, but for the right he hath, as you haue told vs. That shall be done (said he) and therewith desired vs to stay till he came again from the cittie, where he staied not long, but hee brought what we de∣sired, and a guide that conducted vs so wel, that the next day about dinner time we arriued where the king lay. Who being aduerti∣sed of our comming, and that wée were of <HI>Agraies</HI> companions, entertained vs most courteously, commaunding one of his Gen∣tlemen to vnarme vs in one of his best chambers, whether hee came, and after hee had bidden vs welcome, beganne in the same manner to shew vs all what the watch had before declared vnto vs, and what an vnnaturall part his nephew shewed vnto him, procured therevnto by two knights, in whome onely hée putteth his whole trust, because (saied hee) they are well assured, that not any of my knights dareth enter into combat with them, they are estéemed so valiant and hardy. But who hath mooued them and your cosin (said we) to vndertake so foule an action? Because (said the king) I haue no issue male, and my cousin alledgeth I am ouer old to gouerne the countrey, saying, it is fitter for him then for me to do it: but if I can I will hold him from it, and kéep it for my doughter <HI>Olinde</HI> and <HI>Agraies</HI> her husband: By my soule (said I) I am of this opinion, that séeing this warre is begun on∣ly to trie the title, you both pretend in one thing, It were good your quarrell shoule bee ended by the combate of two knights of both parts, without the death and destruction of so many poore innocent people as daily perish by the same means, remitting the issue thereof to those whome it shall please God to make victori∣ous: and if it pleaseth you, I and my companion will bee the two knights that shall fight for you. But when hée heard mee speake in that manner, hee paused a while, séeming very pensiue, till in the end he answered me and saied, Sir knights, I am not yet so well acquainted with you, that I should venture to hazard so
<PB REF="32"/> great a kingdome as this is vpon your valour, Neuerthelesse, if you will assure me for a truth that you are knights of the Ferme Island, I am content to stand to it whatsoeuer may chance. For there can none but valiant knights come from thence, being as∣sured (as I suppose) that otherwise the lord of the place would not giue them intertainement. Then wee swore vnto him, that what wee had saied was true. Wherevpon hee presently dispat∣ched a trumpet with message to his enemy, to offer him the com∣bate, who hearing the newes séemed very glad, making account that his two knights (so much estéemed) would easily ouercome any two of the best knights the king had. So that returning the messenger againe, hee sent one of his trumpets with him to con∣clude the combate, with the day, time and place where it should be done, as also what pledges should on both sides bee giuen for performance thereof, so that on the day appointed, after ech par∣ty had solemnly taken their othes, wée entred into y<SUP>e</SUP> lists, where wee had a cruell and dangerous combate one against the other, but in the end right lying on our sides, wee wan the victory. And as we would haue striken off their heads, the kings nephew de∣sired vs most earnestly to graunt him their liues, which wee a∣gréed vnto, vpon condition, that from that time forwards hee should suffer his vncle to raigne in peace, not molesting him any more, which he promised to performe. In this combate we were so wounded, that of force we continued in Norway longer then wee meant to do, where during our abode, certaine marchants arriued in the cittie, that had séene (as they told vs) vpon the sea, néere vnto the rocke of the Enchauntresse, a Serpent greater then any vessell, which so much astonished them, that they knew not what to doe, whereby we heard newes of <HI>Esplandian.</HI> With that (although we were not altogether healed of our wounds) yet we besought the king to cause vs to bee conducted thether, which hee willingly graunted, and wee tooke sea, with so good a wind, that within sixe daies after wee approched the rocke where the serpent staied, y<SUP>t</SUP> at the first made vs somewhat abashed, although we had séene it oftentimes before. Neuerthelesse, we found it fla∣shing such flames of fire out of the mouth and nosthrils thereof,
<PB REF="32"/> that wee feared the fire would fall into our shippe, whereby not without much paine and trouble, wee procured our maister and marriners to approch it, and perceiuing no creature aboord to speake vnto, we began to hallow vnto them with so loud a voice, that at the last <HI>Sergil</HI> appeared vpon the hatches, and wéeping, told vs what had happened vnto his maister on the rocke of the Enchauntresse, and how after that one of the dumbe men had caused him to enter into a little barke, and there with put to sea, so that hée knew not if hee were dead or liuing, for hee had heard no newes of him, and there hee staied with another dumbe man in the greatest care that might bée. With that wee willed him to call the dumbe man vnto vs, and when hee came, by signes wée made vnto him, we shewed him what pleasure he might doe vs if he would bring vs to y<SUP>e</SUP> place where his fellow had carried <HI>Esplan∣dian,</HI> which as it séemed he was content to doe, for presently ther∣vpon he entered into our vessels and sailed so well, that the tenth day after he set vs on land, hard by the place where wee slew the Giant and the two knights, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd so your grace hath heard what fortunes wee haue passed since wee receiued the order of knight∣hood. Truly (said the king) if those of <HI>Manely</HI> &amp; the king of Den∣marke be as strange, it may well bée saied, there neuer happened the like beginning vnto sixe yong knights.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. How one night as King <HI>Luisart</HI> was in his bed, thinking how hee might returne againe into great Brittaine, hee heard so pleasant a sound of instruments, that hee rose vp to see where it might bee: and what happened after that.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">K</SEG>Ing <HI>Luisart</HI> cōtinued so long in the castle on the moun∣taine, that at the last hee waxed weary, not so much for the desire he had to bee in his owne countrey, as for the gréefe he certainely knew the Quéene would conceiue, by reason of his long absence: in which kinde of pensiuenesse hee continued certaine nights together, that by meanes thereof hee
<PB REF="33"/> could take no rest, till at the last one night among the rest about halfe an hower before day, he heard the swéetest musick that euer plaied, wherewith hee rose out of his bed, and without making any noise opened the window, to heare it better. But as then it was very darke, and the wind blew so hard, that the sea rising therewith, beat against the hollownesse of the rocke, in such sort that the noise thereof, and the sound of the musicke, made a new kind of harmony: wherewith hee was so much delighted, that hee awaked <HI>Esplandian, Ambor</HI> and <HI>Talanque,</HI> that slept soundly, as yoong men without malancholy humours, are accustomed to doe. But when they heard the musicke, they staied not long in their beds, but went to the window to sée who it might bee, but they could sée nothing till day began to appeare. When they per∣ceiued the great Serpent surging on the shoare, wherwith they were excéeding glad, making full account that the arriuall ther∣of brought them some good newes: Wherewith they made them ready, and without longer staying, issued out of the castle, to sée who was in the same, and as they stood on the shore, they percea∣ued a smal boat, and a Gentlewoman comming out of it, bearing in her arms a packet couered with Taffata, who comming vnto the king, with most humble reuerence saied vnto him. My lord, and it pleaseth your grace, <HI>Vrganda</HI> recommendeth her vnto your maiesty, and hath commanded me to giue you intelligence, that being busied to aide the Emperour and the Empresse your doughter, in a certaine thing of great importance, shee hath not had the means to come and visite you. Then presenting y<SUP>e</SUP> packet to <HI>Esplandian,</HI> said vnto him, Gentle knight, My mistresse that lo∣ueth and fauoureth you, as it is well knowne, giueth you these armes, and sendeth you word by mee, that as shee gaue you the blacke armes, that hetherto you haue borne (to testifie thereby the sorrow for the losse of the king, that as then was common a∣mong all his true subiects and friends) So in these you shal finde the deuise of the lady, that in beautie and comelinesse of person surpasseth all the ladies in the world, as <HI>Amadis</HI> your father in time past well proued, when shee set the crowne vpon her head, in remembraunce whereof shee hath euer sithence borne the like
<PB REF="33"/> deuise. Who from henceforth shall bee so strongly fixed in your heart, that you shal neuer giue stroke with sword nor launce, but you will remember her. Which she said in respect of the princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> doughter to the Emperour of Constantinople, that by destinie was appointed only vnto him. And opening the pack shee pulled out a helmet, shield, Haubert, and a Caparisson for a horse all of white, imbrodered with crowns of gold, and set with Diamonds and Pearles, which hée most willingly receiued, say∣ing to the Gentlewoman: I pray you in my behalfe giue <HI>Vrgan∣da</HI> hearty thankes for the great honour and much good shee hath continually done vnto me, assuring her, that wheresoeuer I be∣come, she hath a knight of mee ready to obay her, and that for the loue of her will beare these armes as long as it pleaseth her. Bée it so in the name of God (saied she) but before long time bee past, you shall haue another mistresse, that will constraine you to doe greater matters, for shée shall rauish both your heart and libertie in such manner, that you should loose ouermuch, if at sometimes you loose not your selfe for her. And to conclude, I tell you that my mistresse féeleth her selfe as yet so much bound, and beholding to my lord <HI>Amadis</HI> your father, because that by his meanes, shee recouered her friend, that during her life she wil vse al the means shee can to doe him plasure, and you likewise for his sake. And as shee deliuered y<SUP>e</SUP> message vnto him, <HI>Carmelle</HI> came thether, and hearing her speake in that manner, answered her and said, Gen∣tlewoman, I pray you tell your mistresse from mée, that she hath great cause to recompence them well, by whom she enioieth her friend she loueth so entirely: and tell her I know many, to whom if such chance should happen, that would not fail to acknowledge it with the price of their déerest blood, and their soules likewise if néed were. In faith (said the gentlewoman) I know not in whose behalfe you speake it, but I know assuredly you touch mée at the quick, which she vttered with so good a grace, that the king could not refraine to smile, hauing in times past felt the fury of loue, when hée first saw the Quéene in the country of Denmarke. Yet bee chaunged his countenance, asking the Gentlewoman from whence that musicke came that hee heard in the morning before
<PB REF="34"/> breake of day. My lord (said she) being sometimes in greater pas∣sions then willingly I would, I passe my melancholy humours with a Lute that I haue, especially when I cannot sléepe, which as I thinke, was it you heard. What company haue you in the Serpent (said the king?) None (said she) but <HI>Esplandians</HI> Squire, that I found in a manner dead, for the desire he had to hear news of his maister, to whome also I haue brought the goodliest white horse, and the best harnaised that euer was séene, which my mi∣stresse sendeth him likewise. Did she commād you to say nothing else vnto me (said the king?) Yes my lord (saied shee) shee sendeth you word, that at my arriuall here, you and hee should enter into this ship, that of it selfe will bring you into great Brittaine, and that the fortunes y<SUP>t</SUP> not long since happened vnto you, are snares the world setteth to intrap those it séeketh to deceiue, séeming to ioine gréene and flourishing age with that which already is dried vp and withered. And further willeth you to put in effect, y<SUP>t</SUP> which in your selfe you haue determined to doe: (which was to forsake his kingly estate, and liue a solitary life) but hee wondered much that <HI>Vrganda</HI> knew it, yet he made no shew therof, but speaking to the Gentlewoman, he saied. Your mistresse bindeth mee daily more and more vnto her, being well assured, that without her helpe I could hardly haue found any to haue brought me into my country. Wherfore I pray you tell her, that whatsoeuer I haue, is at her commandement, and as touching my determination, which (as soone as I conceiued in my mind, I perceiued it was knowne to her) being at home, if God giueth me life, I meane to put in execution. My lord (saied shee) she praieth you to commend the kéeping of this castle to <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor,</HI> (not taking a∣ny with you but <HI>Esplandian, Sergil,</HI> &amp; maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI>) knowing for certaine that hereafter they shall doe such things, that their renoume will spread throughout the world. Wherewith my lord I will take my leaue, and returne againe to her with the dumbe men, that shall guide me in this little barke. God haue you in his kéeping (saied the king.) Then the Gentlewoman with her two Marriners entered into the barke that brought <HI>Esplandian</HI> the∣ther, and setting saile, put to sea.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Gentlewoman that brought the mes∣sage with the two dumbe men, imbarked and put to sea, farre from the rocke: king <HI>Luisart</HI> and the rest went vnto the castle, where he staied not long, for according to the aduise <HI>Vrganda</HI> had giuen him, hee de∣sired <HI>Ambor</HI> &amp; <HI>Talanque</HI> with <HI>Libee</HI> and the rest of the company to kéep the castle, promising with all spéed to send them prouision of all thinges ne∣cessary, whereof they wanted. But when <HI>Esplandian</HI> saw there was no remedy, but of force he must obey the king (much displea∣sed to depart so farre from the borders of Constantinople, where he hoped to find her whereof maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had brought him the first newes) hée tooke his faithfull seruant <HI>Carmelle</HI> aside, and said vnto her: My good friend, I was in mind neuer to falsifie the promise I haue made you, nor the gift you required at my hands, neuerthelesse, trusting more in you then any other, I pray you take it not in euill part, if (to saue my life) I send you to a place, whether I thought to haue gone my self in person, but it pleaseth the king (as you wel know) that I shal beare him company.

My good friend (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) imbracing her, I wil one day recompence your good will, &amp; séeing you are minded to do me so much fauour, you must then take your iourney to Constanti∣nople, on message to the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> the Emperours
<PB REF="35"/> doughter, to whom (hauing presented my most humble and har∣ty commendations) you shall on my behalfe say, How that at such time as I receiued the order of knighthood, I was comman∣ded by my lord <HI>Amadis</HI> my father to repaire to her fathers court, there to discharge him of the promise hee made vnto her (which was either to returne againe to doe her seruice, or to send one of his linage thether in his place) Neuerthelesse, considering with my selfe his great valour and Prowesse, and the great beauty that is reported to bee in her, which my small desert in regard of him that gaue me the commandement, I am afraid to vndertake the same. Notwithstanding, it hath pleased her (by maistee <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI>) to put mee in mind thereof, although while breath is in my body I will neuer faile to be her knight. And to the end shee may giue credite to your message, you shal present this ring vnto her, which she knoweth well, as being the same she gaue vnto my fa∣ther, to put him in remembrance of his promise. My lord (saied she) I will fulfill your commandement, but if you goe so far from hence, where shal I find you, when I come backe again? In this place (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) whether I will returne as soone as I haue brought the king into great Brittaine. Then calling <HI>Libee,</HI> hee commanded him, that presently after hee had set saile, hee should cause a ship to be prepared for <HI>Carmelle,</HI> to goe on message where he would send her, that done, hee went to finde the king and mai∣ster <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that staied for him in the Serpent, the which pre∣sently vpon his entring therein, of her self began to set forwards with such spéede, that in short space they left the coast of Turkie, and the twentith day after, they discouered y<SUP>e</SUP> Ferme Isle, where she staied, which those of y<SUP>e</SUP> country perceiuing, aduertised <HI>Ama∣dis</HI> and the rest of the company, who in great hast ran vnto the Hauen, but they were no sooner come thether, when they espied the king, <HI>Esplandian,</HI> maister <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and <HI>Sergil,</HI> landing out of a little boat.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIIII. How King <HI>Luisart</HI> departed from the Ferme Isle, accompanied of diuers knights, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, and being neere Lon∣don, in a forrest they met with foure knights, that sent to ask four courses with their launces against <HI>Esplandian.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hrée daies king <HI>Luisart</HI> continued in the Ferme Isle, and the fourth day hee deter∣mined to goe see the Quéene, and to the same end, with all y<SUP>e</SUP> company of knights, ladies, and gentlewomen, he set forwards towards London, and trauailed so fast, that they were within a daies iourney of the cittie. And as they entred into a for∣rest, where they vsed commonly to chase the Hart, they saw in the high way foure knights, well mounted &amp; armed at all points, each his Esquire by his side, bearing their shield and launces, for they had their helmets on their heads. And with that they percei∣ued a Gentlewoman comming towards them, riding on a pal∣frey, and being néere them, speaking to <HI>Esplandian,</HI> she saied, Sir knight with the white armes, those foure knights you sée in the high way before you, send you word by me, that they would glad∣ly know the cause why you beare the deuise of crownes, wherin
<PB REF="36"/> if you satisfie their desire, in such sort that their honours bee not stained, they will from henceforth refraine to inquire the same any more: otherwise, they giue you by me to vnderstand, it were best for you to leaue them, or else that you defend them well, as being the most honourable deuise that is in all the world. When <HI>Esplandian</HI> heard her speake in that manner, in courteous sort he answered her and said. Gentlewoman, to satisfie their request I pray you tell them, that the deuise and the armes I beare was gi∣uen me by <HI>Vrganda,</HI> but for what cause I know not, neuertheles I bear them for the loue of her, as also that they like me wel: and if this content them not, tel them, mee thinketh the occasion of combate betwéene mee and them is so small, that for this time I would desire them to forbeare the same. In good faith (saied shee) smiling, you speak with reason, for they are knights that séeme to haue much néed of your counsell, but notwithstanding good sir, I pray you bee not vnprouided, for your excuses will not bee recei∣ued. Gentlewoman (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) if they assaile me, it shall bee against my wil. Truly (said she) as farre as I perceiue, the great beautie that is in you, together with the rich armes and goodly horse you ride vpon are worse bestowed then euer was any, when you are not ashamed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> make an answere so little to your credite. Neuerthelesse, either you must forsake the way to Lon∣don, and this good company, or defend the braue deuise you bear, as they haue sent you word. The way (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) is com∣mon to all men, and out of it (for them) I will not goe, wherefore if they assaile me, I must of force defend my self. And because the Gentlewoman was not knowne among them, they all mused who she might me, as also who the foure knights were that sent her, to whom shée returned againe. Meane time <HI>Esplandian</HI> laced on his helmet, taking his launce in his hand, ready to fight if occasion serued. Wherewith <HI>Amadis</HI> and the rest of the compa∣ny were excéeding glad, doubting least the king had spoken in fa∣uour of him, when he shewed what he had done, but they had not ridden long, but one of y<SUP>e</SUP> four knights came riding softly towards them, and about a carriers length from them, called to <HI>Esplandian</HI> and said, You sir knight that would not satisfie our desires, defend
<PB REF="36"/> your selfe from mee. Wherewith hee set spurres to his horse and <HI>Esplandian</HI> likewise, who at y<SUP>e</SUP> first encounter cast him so strong∣ly out of his saddle, that in long time after hee could not rise a∣gaine, and therewith his launce brake: with y<SUP>t</SUP> the second knight came forwards, willing <HI>Esplandian</HI> to take another launce, for he meant to reuenge his companion. Which <HI>Amadis</HI> hearing, sent him his launce, that he willingly receiued, and being in a rage to sée himselfe assailed without cause, hée ranne against the knight, and strake him so surely on the brest, that he ouerthrew him both horse and man. Well (said the king) to the standers by, iudge you if it be possible to doe better? My lord (said <HI>Agraies</HI>) I neuer saw two fairer strokes giuen with a launce, the rest I will leaue to consider of till I know those that ranne against him. Let vs sée the end (saied the king) and calling a Squire, hee sent his launce vnto <HI>Esplandian,</HI> for as then the third knight prepared himselfe to runne, and spurring their horses, set forwards so fiercely, that breaking their launces, they met so strongly, body and shields, and heads together, that <HI>Esplandian</HI> had much adoe to sit vpon his horse, and the other had such a fall, that he lay stil vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> ground. Whereat the fourth knight being abashed, saied vnto himselfe, Truly, both the king and <HI>Vrgan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ue good reason (as they do) to assure the valor and Prowesse of this knight, séeing it is much more then they warrant it to bee: Neuerthelesse, I must of force trie him, otherwise I should doe both my selfe and him wrong. And with that he called <HI>Esplandian</HI> and said, Knight, Although I well know the small courtesie, that I and my companions haue shewed vnto you, yet I must not refuse to doe the same that they haue done before me, wherefore I pray you send to some of your company for another launce, that we may sée who shall beare the honour of this enterprise. I will doe it (saied hee) séeing you con∣straine me therevnto, vpon condition that if I can, I will serue you in the like sort I haue done your companions. With that <HI>Gransador</HI> that heard them speake, gaue him his launce, which he presently charging, they met together with such force, that their launces brake close vnto their hands, neither of them remo∣uing out his saddle, wherefore the knight of the forrest turned to
<PB REF="37"/> <HI>Esplandian</HI> and saied, Sir Knight; let vs yet trie one blow more, and I will quite you for this time. You might content your selfe (said hée) with that is done, but séeing you are so void of reason, I am content to trie it with you, till one of vs bee beaten off his horse. Then he sent <HI>Sergil</HI> to fetch another lance, and he brought him one some what bigger and shorter then those hee had before, wherewith hee strooke the knight of the forrest so valiantly, that he ouerthrew him, himself being constrained to imbrace his horse about the necke, or else he had fallen as the other did that lay on the ground, yet he rose before <HI>Esplandian</HI> had runne out his course and as he returned barke, he staied him by the armour and saied vnto him, Before God sir knight, you haue sufficiently shewed that in valour and Prowesse you are second to none but to your selfe: but hee answered not a word, but holding downe his head (ashamed of that had happened vnto him) passed forth. With that the king came thether to knowe what knights they were that had ben ouerthrowne, among the which he knew <HI>Galaor,</HI> for hee had put off his helmet to do him honour when he saw him come, wherat the king was so well pleased, that he alighted of his horse and ranne to imbrace him, the like did <HI>Amadis,</HI> saying vnto him, with a smiling countenaunce, How now brother <HI>Galaor,</HI> how long haue you vsed to be a kéeper of the high waies? You sée (said hee) that I and my companions haue sought to trie whether this knight be of such force as we haue found him, and what hath hap∣pened you may well iudge, when <HI>Esplandian</HI> vnderstood his vn∣cle <HI>Galaor</HI> (fearing to haue offended) hee lighted off his horse, and knéeling downe before him, asked pardon for his fault. Nephew (saied hée) it is I that haue done the wrong, and therefore I tolde the king that you are a better knight then I, and maruaile not if I sought to prooue it, Because I thought to doe it with mine ho∣nour, but I found the contrary, which from henceforth shal make me thinke the things foreshewed of you will bee accomplished so well, that the glory of your father, and the reputation by many knights in times past obtained, shall from henceforth bee extin∣guished, you hauing so easily ouerthrowne thrée of y<SUP>e</SUP> best knights in great Brittaine, and my selfe the fourth. What are they (said
<PB REF="37"/> the king?) My lord (said <HI>Galaor</HI>) the first that ranne was <HI>Sendale</HI> of <HI>Gonaste,</HI> the second <HI>Galuanes,</HI> the third <HI>Angriote d'estrauaulx,</HI> and my selfe hath done worse then they. Wherat the king and al the company began to laugh: And imbracing them, caused them to mount on horsebacke, riding towards London, where in the way the King praied them to tell him howe this enterprise was deuised. My Lord (saied <HI>Galaor</HI>) hauing vnderstoode by the danish Gentlewoman (that my lady <HI>Oriane</HI> not long since sent vnto the Quéene, to bring her newes of your returne, and what had hap∣pened vnto you during your imprisonment) the valiant acts by you declared of my nephew <HI>Esplandian,</HI> wee conceiued such a iea∣lousie against him, estéeming the honour you did him thereby, to procéed rather of fatherly loue then otherwise, that wée determi∣mined secretly to depart out of London to proue his force, as now you haue well séene: and to moue him therevnto, we sent the gen∣tlewoman with the message you haue heard. Of my faith (saied the king) the deuise was good, and hath fallen out well. In this manner deuising of sundry things, hee came to Mirefleur, where the Quéen met him, praising God for his vnexpected return, and considering his trouble past, with the gréefe shee had for his long absence, séeing him there safe and in good health, shee thought her selfe well recompenced with his presence. The next day in the morning they set forwards towards London, where the people receiued him with such signs of gladnesse, that most part of them wept for ioy to sée him, for there was neuer Prince better loued of his subiects thē he. Being there, <HI>Esplandian</HI> began to be weary of the place, longing to heare news of <HI>Carmelle,</HI> that he had sent to Constantinople, as you haue heard before. And therefore eue∣ry day hee deuised meanes to get licence to depart from thence, pretending a cause of returning to the castle called <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> shewing the king what promise he had made to his com∣panions, which if hee did not performe, they should haue cause to complaine of him, but the king would not in any sort graunt to his request, yet in the end, ouercome with much importunity, he was content, wherewith hee tooke his leaue of all the court, and vpon a monday in the morning taking horse, accompanied onely
<PB REF="38"/> of maister <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and <HI>Sergil</HI> his squire, hee tooke his way to∣wards the Ferme Isle, hoping to finde the great Serpent there, wherein they might imbarke themselues.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. How <HI>Esplandian</HI> riding towards the Ferme Isle, was assailed by a strange knight that watched him in the forrest.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>Splandian</HI> departed from the king, and hauing taken his leaue of all the court, as you heard before, tooke the crooked∣dest way hee could, through woods and forrests towards the Ferme Isie, thin∣king not to bee perceiued of any, that might hinder his enterprise. And ha∣uing ridden thrée miles, he entered in∣to a forrest, which hauing almost pas∣sed, hée came vnto a great riuer▪ wherevpon the king had built a house, called Bellerose, where oftentimes being on hunting, hee vsed to resort. And as he thought to passe the bridge, he perceiued on the other side a knight armed at all points ready to fight, that cried vnto him with a loud voice, and said: Sir knight, you must aske me leaue if you wil come ouer, for according to my promise, I haue taken vpon mee to kéepe this bridge, for the space of one whole yeare, wherefore if you thinke good, you may take some other way. With that <HI>Esplandian</HI> was much gréeued, perceiuing that either of force he must fight, or séeke another passage, wher∣fore he would willingly haue excused himselfe, &amp; said: Sir knight, I pray you then shew mee which way I were best to goe, for by me you shall haue no cause at this time to trouble your selfe. You must returne again to London (said he) for other passage is there none, vnlesse you will loose your horse and goe on foot. Rather the I would doe so (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) I will proue if I can win yours, and therewith lacing his helmet, tooke his launce and road vnto the knight, who no sooner perceiued him comming, but setting
<PB REF="38"/> spurres to his horse, ranne towards him, whereby they met so fiercely together, that both y<SUP>e</SUP> knights fell off their horses, in such manner, that maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Sergil,</HI> thought verily they had slaine each other, but they staied not long before they rose a∣gaine, and laying hand on their swordes, there began betwéene them the cruellest and most daungerous battell that euer was séene: whereat maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> much abashed, said vnto him∣selfe, Good God, what may this meane, I beléeue for certain that some diuell of hell hath transformed himselfe into humane shape, to destroy vs all. Meane time the two knights continued in most cruell fight, still increasing their mights, cleauing shields and ar∣mours, in such sort, that all the field was couered with péeces of the harneis, and died with blood that issued from their bodies, till at the last the knight of the bridge stept backe &amp; said vnto <HI>Esplan∣dian,</HI> Sir knight, take another way, and I am content to quite you of the combate, for you are the valiantest knight that euer I dealt withall, and it should displease mee much, if by your wilful∣nesse you would be cause of your owne death. In good faith (saied he) I had done it at the first, had it not beene, the feare I had, that you would estéeme me a coward, but knowing very wel that the honour of this combate cannot bee had, but onely by the death of one of vs, or both together, I will trie my fortune, till I bee no longer able to weld a sword. Is that true (said the knight?) Then let vs sée to whom fortune will be fauourable. And therewith co∣uering themselues with that little of their shields that rested in their hands, they began the combate crueller then before, as though all the day they had not giuen a stroke, so that after many cruel blowes with their swords, they closed together, and wrast∣ling long time, they sought to cast each other to the ground. But séeing the little aduantage gotten thereby, they began againe to lay on with their swords with such fury, that <HI>Sergil</HI> looked for no other but when they should fall dead vpon the ground, not béeing able to iudge who would haue the victory. Whereat maister <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI> was so much displeased, that hee could not abstaine from wéeping, saying vnto himselfe, Alas what fortune is this, must the best knight liuing in the world, and in the flower of his age
<PB REF="39"/> lose his life at that time by so hard a chaunce? Cursed be the day that euer he met with him, that is the cause of so great losse. And to say truth, if God had not prouided for them, the father had slain the sonne, and the sonne the father, for the knight of the bridge was <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> who being ouer curious of his sonnes glo∣ry would proue his force, and the better to doe it, the day before <HI>Esplandian</HI> tooke his leaue, hee departed secretly from the court, and staied for him at the bridge, bearing an vnknowne armour, where after many attempts on either part giuen, <HI>Amadis</HI> per∣ceiuing both their dangers, said vnto <HI>Esplandian:</HI> Knight, you sée well you cannot ouercome mee, and I assure you, I neuer had to doe with any knight, that euer put mee to so great extreamity, wherefore I am content to let you passe. But not I you (saied he) vnlesse you tell me your name. I will not deny you that (saied <HI>Amadis</HI>) wherefore cause maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to come hether, for I thinke we haue both néed of his helpe. Then <HI>Esplandian</HI> called him vnto them, meane time <HI>Amadis</HI> put off his helmet, so faint and weary, that hée was constrained to leane vnto a trée. But when <HI>Esplandian</HI> knew him and perceiuing the fault he had com∣mitted, he cast forth a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crie, and saied: Alas wicked wretch that I am, and therewith he fell vpon the ground, whereat mai∣ster <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Amadis</HI> thinking him to bee in a sound, ranne to lift him vp, but it was not so, onely that it gréeued him hée had dealt in such manner with his father, who said vnto him, sonne, although I am as sore wounded as possible may bee, without death, yet haue I not receiued so much hurt, as conceiued plea∣sure, perceiuing the valour I find to be in you, wherefore bee not discomforted. Notwithstanding he could not content himselfe, but cursed his owne life, being (as he said) the most vnhappy man that euer was borne of woman. And continuing in that gréefe, y<SUP>e</SUP> blood in diuers places ranne out of his body, whereby he waxed faint, which maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> perceiuing, and knowing assuredly, if remedy were not spéedily had, they were both in danger of their liues, hee saied vnto them: I pray you for this time leaue off your sorrow, and let vs presently go to Mirefleur, not far from hence, for you both haue greater néede of rest, then of longer staying in
<PB REF="39"/> this place, wherewith he and <HI>Sergil</HI> set them on their horses, and with great pain brought them to the castle, where their wounds were dressed. Such was the combate betwéene the two knights as you haue heard, yet some write, that <HI>Amadis</HI> was so wounded by <HI>Esplandian,</HI> that in the end with a thrust of a launce into the right shoulder, and other blowes with his sword, hee was slaine in the field, which <HI>Oriane</HI> hearing, threw her selfe out of a win∣dow, and brake her necke. But it is not true, for they raigned af∣ter that both in Fraunce and great Brittaine, and had another sonne named <HI>Perion,</HI> and a doughter no lesse beautifull then her mother, that married <HI>Arquisil</HI> sonne to the Emperour of Rome. But I cannot conceiue from whence those lyers could inuent such a thing, if they vnderstand not by (death) the shadowes that <HI>Esplandian</HI> caused his fathers valiant acts to bee couered withall, by the light and pleasant shining of his owne, wherby his fathers were so much had in obliuion, that there was no more brute of them, then if they had neuer beene done. But to returne againe vnto our matter, you must note that newes went presently vnto the court, what had chanced to the two knights. Wherewith the king and <HI>Oriane</HI> much displeased, departed from London, &amp; came to Mirefleur, when maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> began the second time to dresse their wounds. Whereby he perceiued them out of danger, and cured them so well, that within seuen daies after they could walke about the chamber, which put <HI>Oriane</HI> in better comfort then before, and it fell out well for her, for if her malancholy had longer indured she had for certain died at that time. And because the king had not as yet vnderstoode the reason that mooued them to fight, one day when hee found <HI>Amadis</HI> in good disposition, hee praied him to tell him. In faith my lord (saied hee) I was desirous to haue the difference of our two forces knowne, being assured, that whatsoeuer chaunced thereby, it could not bee but to mine honour: for if my sonne bee a better knight then my selfe, his ho∣nour for the present time, will increase my glory past. Before God (saied the king) your enterprise was but rashly vndertaken, I pray you another time let vs leaue such youthfull partes for those that are but entring into arms. Beléeue me, and it pleaseth
<PB REF="40"/> your grace (saied hée) I was neuer better beaten in all my life. It is no matter (saied the king) séeing you haue both escaped with your liues, now séeke meanes to bée healed of your wounds with as much spéede as you may, and from henceforth let vs war only against Harts and other wild beasts that are within this forrest, as my huntsmen haue shewed me this day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. How the King of Denmarke, <HI>Garinter,</HI> and <HI>Manely,</HI> succoured <HI>Vr∣ganda,</HI> that certaine knights would haue slaine, because she aided the Emperors sonne of Rome.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Ou heard before of the aduentures of <HI>Esplandi∣an, Ambor</HI> and <HI>Talanque,</HI> after they had recei∣ued the order of knighthood, now you shall heare what became of <HI>Garinter</HI> king of Den∣marke, and <HI>Manely,</HI> who sléeping as others did by the sound of sixe trumpets that plaied on the shore, the next night they found them∣selues with their squires in a little barke, so farre out of al know∣ledge, that although they had landed they knew not where they were, and it was so darke, that they could not sée each other, till at the last they perceiued a fire not farre from thence, that moued them to goe thether, to sée if they could find any that would shew them in what country they were, therefore leauing their squires to kéepe their barke, they tooke their shields, and mounting vp a little hill, they perceiued a fire burning circle wise, in the middle whereof they saw a woman holding a yong child in her armes, and about the fire stood tenne knights all armed, that sought to take her, but by no meanes they could come néere her, she was so well defended by the fire. And as they went néerer vnto it, they heard one among the rest that said vnto her, Ha, thou false and accursed wretch, thy diuellish spirits and familiars can now no longer helpe thée, but at this time thou shalt surely die. And al∣though <HI>Manely</HI> and <HI>Garinter</HI> had their helmets on their heads,
<PB REF="40"/> yet the woman they so threatened, knew them well, calling thē and said: Help me my sonnes, and faile me not I pray you at this time. With that <HI>Manely</HI> and the king of Denmarke knew her by her voice, wherefore laying hands on their swords, they mar∣ched towards the tenne knights, wherof one of them stepped be∣fore the rest, asking them if they knew that wicked woman that had done him the greatest mischiefe that euer was. By God sir knight (said <HI>Manely</HI>) you lie in your throat, she is not wicked, but faithfuller for her part, then you for yours. Wherewith they ran each vpon other, and there began the combate of tenne knights against two, and although the match was not equall, <HI>Manely</HI> and the king of Denmarke setting their backes together, laied valiantly vpon them, yet in the end they could not haue resisted, but <HI>Vrganda</HI> playing her part, put out the fire, and taking her two knights aside, left the rest in the darke, striking each other as if <HI>Manely</HI> and the king of Denmarke had beene with them. Meane time <HI>Vrganda</HI> and her company got into the thicket of the wood, and hauing trauailed long, at the last the moone began to shine, when they were weary, whereby they determined to stay a while and rest themselues till day appeared. Meane time the two knights desired <HI>Vrganda</HI> to shewe them how shee came thether, and whether she knew the country. My good friends (said she) hauing long since learned by my art, that this little child son to the Emperour of Rome, and of the Empresse <HI>Leonor</HI> his wife, should bee stollen away by the Traitor that assailed you, who is sonne to <HI>Garadan,</HI> that <HI>Amadis</HI> (as then called the knight of the gréene sword) put to death in the countrey of Bohemia, in defen∣ding the right of king <HI>Tafmor:</HI> As soone as you fell on sléepe in the great Serpent, I made al the hast I could vnto this place to suc∣cour it, according to my promise made (being in the Ferme Isle) in presence of <HI>Amadis</HI> and diuers other knights, where I arri∣ued at so good a time when the villaines which you saw, came to a shepheards house, where a poore nurse dwelt, to whom they de∣liuered this little child to giue it sucke. And séeing it was time to put my enterprise in practise, I went out of my barke, and ma∣king as if I had ben robbed by certaine théeues, ranne towards
<PB REF="41"/> them, crying out and wéeping bitterly, wherewith they all came forth to sée what it might be, and perceiuing me in that manner, asked the cause of my gréefe. Ha my lords (said I) It is so, that as my husband &amp; I passed through this wood, wée met eight théeues, that slew him, and not content therewith, haue taken away my horse and my budget, wherein there is a great summe of money. Which they beléeuing to bee true, (not that they were mooued with compassion for my losse) but respecting their owne particu∣lar benefite, hoping to get a booty by them that had robbed mee, scattered themselues in companies to find them out, where they staied so long, that the shéepheard and his wife went out of the house, and thinking to haue their parts, left mee alone with the child, that not long after I tooke in mine armes, and went away. But as it fell out, the nurse came in, and missing the child, called to them for help, who running in great hast, followed mée so fast, (that had it not ben for night that ouertooke them) and the great fire you found about mee, I had neuer escaped their hands. And what would they haue done with this poore infant (said <HI>Manely?</HI>) You shall vnderstand (said she) that the sonne of <HI>Garadan</HI> hauing conceiued a mortal hatred against the Emperour, either because he could not haue the entertainement hee thought hee had deser∣ued, or else gréeued (as I thinke) that hee could not attaine vnto the Empire, as hee pretended: determined not onely to reuenge himselfe vpon this little child, but to kill the Emperour likewise if euer he haue the means. By God (said the king of Denmark) hée is a wicked and cruell hearted man, but assure your selfe that God wil not permit it to be so. Neuerthelesse I am in doubt this child will indure much woe, séeing you haue no meanes to giue it sucke. Let me alone with that (said <HI>Vrganda</HI>) for I haue certain hearbes about me, with the iuice wherof I will nourish it, if néed be eight daies together. What (saied hee) will you then stay here so long? No (said <HI>Vrganda</HI>) for as soone as it is day I will returne vnto my boat that staieth here at the shoare. But madame (saied they) what shal become of vs? for we are arriued here, not know∣ing who brought vs hether. But for Gods sake, if you haue heard any newes of our companions, let vs knew it, and where wee
<PB REF="41"/> may goe to find them. My friends (said shee) you must first let de∣steny haue his course, and indure many hard aduentures, &amp; when time serueth you shall haue your desires. And in that manner sometimes talking and sometimes sléeping, they passed the time away till day began to appeare, when they thrée together went to the sea side, where they entered into <HI>Vrgandas</HI> boat, wherein foure Gentlewomen and two dwarfes staied for her.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Or a time <HI>Vrganda</HI> staied with the two knights, not minding presently to ease the Emperours mind with the recouery of his sonne, in the end she caused them to returne vnto their barke, wil∣ling them from that time forwards to arm them∣selues against the assaults of fortune, although she séemed neuer so variable and vnconstant. For (said shée) there∣fore was y<SUP>e</SUP> order of knighthood instituted &amp; appointed, that there∣by it might appeare more excellent. And they were no sooner de∣parted, but she set foot on land, and mounted on a palfrey with the child in her lappe, shee rude forward, with two dragons to guard her, one vpon her right hand, the other vpon the left, that bare her company till shée came to Triol, where the Emperour helde his court. And approching the Towne, she met great companies of knights that went to séeke the child, who séeing those horrible beasts casting fire out of their mouths, for feare they began to flie, whereat <HI>Vrganda</HI> smiled.

And for my part, I estéeme my selfe bet∣ter guarded (being in your company) then I did before, wherfore I pray you leaue me not, till I haue deliuered this child vnto his mother, which I haue recouered from the villaines that had stol∣len it from her.

With that they rode together till they came to the Emperours court, where they found the Empresse halfe dead for sorrow, but when shee heard the good newes <HI>Vrganda</HI> brought, her sorrow turned to excéeding ioy. And for that the em∣perour being armed, was ridden out to séeke the child, as others did, shee sent men on all sides to certefie him thereof, hee hauing intelligence, thanked God with all his heart, and turned backe to sée <HI>Vrganda,</HI> that told him in what manner she found the child, as you haue heard before.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. Of the strange aduentures that the king of Denmarke and Manely had, after they departed from Vrganda, and what pastime they had with two great apes in an Island, where by chaunce they ar∣riued.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter the king of Denmarke and <HI>Manely</HI> departed from <HI>Vrganda,</HI> they entered in∣to their barke, where their two Squires staied for them, and so imbarked, present∣ly hoised saile and put to sea, the weather very peaceable and calme: but they had not sailed long, when a contrary winde began to rise, wherewith y<SUP>e</SUP> waters grew so high, and the sea began to swell so bigge, that one while it sée∣med to mount vnto the skies, and againe to descend as low as the bottomelesse pit of hel, whereby their little barke, was often∣times couered with water, hauing neither maste, saile, nor ca∣ble, but all rent in péeces. And that which abashed thē most was, that night comming vpon them, it was so darke, they could not sée the length of their boat, in which torment they continued for the space of thirty daies together, till at the length it cast them vpon an Island, where (being arriued about sunne setting) they landed. Then commaunding one of their squires to kéepe their boat, being armed at all points, they went into the Island to sée if they could find any fresh water or other victuals, for they had not sufficient in their barke to serue them for a wéeke, at the last they found a goodly fountaine, shadowed with many great trées, whereby they sat them downe, and putting off their helmets for to drinke, <HI>Argenton</HI> their squire that was with them, saied vnto them: if you thinke good, gou shall stay here while I goe vp this high rocke, where (it may be) I shal find a house, or some country man that will shew vs in what place we are arriued? Goe (saied the king of Denmarke) but take héede thou loosest not thy selfe.
<PB REF="43"/> With that the squire left them, and tooke his way through the wood, but he had not gone a long bowes shot, when he perceaued a great Beare comming towards him, wherewith hee was in such feare, that with a lowd voice he cried out for helpe, and fin∣ding no other remedy, hee was constrained to climbe into a high trée. The knights hearing their squires crie, supposed he had néed of them, and with that they ranne in such hast to helpe him, that forgetting their helmets behind them, left them by the fountain, and they had not runne farre, but they espied the Bear climbing against the trée, wherein the Squire was defending himselfe as well as he could, but the beast forsaking her first pray, ranne vn∣to <HI>Manely,</HI> being next vnto her, thinking at the first encounter to throw him on the ground, but he stepping aside, gaue her such a blow with his sword, that therewith he cut off one of her eares with a péece of her iaw, but the Beare turned again, and taking him most fiercely about the body thought to strangle him, wher∣with he had almost lost his breath, when the king of Denmarke came vnto her, and with one blow cut one of her legs clean from the body, whereby the beast in great anguish forsaking her pray, fled into the thicket of the wood, and the king after her, and lon∣ger had followed, had it not ben for the waight of his armor, that wearied him ouermuch, wherefore returning againe vnto his companion, they two help their Squire <HI>Argenton</HI> to come down the trée, who as yet for feare trembled like a leafe, whereat they both began to laugh, <HI>Manely</HI> asking him if he were a cold, no (said he) but I was in the greatest feare that euer I had in all my life, or euer I hope shall haue againe, and surely I beléeue there are no other people in this Island, then diuels disguised in straunge formes, or else such proper Gentlewomen, as she that of late im∣braced you so courteously, wherefore I am of this opinion, that for our better security, it were best for vs to stay by the fountain, or in our barke till the sea bee somewhat pacefied. In truth thou saiest well (saied the king of Denmarke) but in the meane time bee thou of a good courage and feare nothing, I knowe not what courage I should haue (saied he) but I pray you for Gods sake let vs be gone, vnlesse you will sée me die here. As farre as I sée (said
<PB REF="43"/> <HI>Manely</HI>) thou wilt neuer die in fight, as long as thou findest meanes to runne away. Not if I may (saied <HI>Argenton</HI>) for if I should, it were done but like a foole. In which manner talking together, they came vnto the fountaine, where they espied two old apes casting their helmets (they had left behind them) one at the other, as lightly as if they had been at Tennise, whereat the two knights and <HI>Argenton</HI> laughed so hartely, that they were al∣most ouercome with laughter: for the apes had no sooner spied them comming, but in great hast they put the helmets on their heads, and climbing vp the trées, skipped from branch to branch, sometimes vp and sometimes down, like two tumblers. As God helpe me (said <HI>Manely</HI>) I like these apes well, for they knew wée were so melancholy on the sea, that they meant to make vs mer∣ry on land, yet I trust they shall not carry away my arms with∣out a combate. Wherewith they tooke vp stones and threw at them, but they turning about, grinned with their téeth, making mouths and mowes, sometimes scratching their arses. Where∣with the king of Denmarke tooke such pleasure, that hee desired <HI>Manely</HI> and <HI>Argenton</HI> to let the apes alone, and as then it began to be night. Wherefore they sent their squire to fetch his compa∣nion, with the rest of the victuals they had in their barke, because the sea rose so high, that they doubted their barke would bee cast on shoare, and breake in péeces, who staied not long before they came againe, and after the knights had eaten of such victuals as they had, they put off their armour, and slept till the next mor∣ning, when they awaked, finding their helmets lying by them, but not their armour, for those newe men of warre had put them on so properly, that by their countenaunces it séemed they had some great combate to fight one against the other, in the top of the high elmes, whereof there were great plenty. But that sport liked not the two knights, that were loath to die in that place for want of food, but made their account, either to put themselues a∣gaine vnto the mercy of the waues, or else goe further into the Island to séeke meat. Wherfore making bowes of wood, which they stringed with their garters, and cutting arrowes to them, sharpe at the points, they shot at those woody champions so long,
<PB REF="44"/> that at the last they compelled them to skip downe, whereby they tooke them, and pulled off their armor, which done, they let them goe, not doing them any hurt.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Ou heard before how the king of Denmarke and <HI>Manely</HI> were by fortune cast vpon the isle of apes, where their boat was cast away, they hauing not victuals longer then for two daies, but God holp them, for the next day as they were vpon the top of one of the highest rocks, they perceiued a ship at sea, which be∣ing driuen with the wind, not long after was cast vpon the shore hard by the place where they were. Wherwith the two knights went downe to speake with them that were aboord, and calling with a lowd voice vnto them, there appeared a man vpon the hatches, that asked them what they would.

Notwithstanding one thing ouercommeth him and vanquisheth his most couragious heart: which is your grace my good lady (said she) whom he loueth, honoureth, and de∣sireth to serue while life indureth. But knowing not if his ser∣uice would be accepted of, he durst not presume to come himselfe in person to offer you the same: although (by him that next after your selfe, may most commaund him) hee had expresse charge to present it vnto you, as bound thereto by promise. And to the end you may giue credite to my wordes, hee sendeth you this ring, which is the very same you gaue to <HI>Amadis,</HI> being in this Court, if your grace can call it to remembrance. With that <HI>Leonorine</HI> tooke it in her hand, and beholding it long time, she saied vnto the Gentlewoman: Truly this ring was sometimes mine, which I gaue vnto the best knight nowe liuing in the world. In faith (said the Gentlewoman) a better knight then hée hath sent it you againe, and that is my lord <HI>Esplandian</HI> his sonne. I neuer sawe him, that I know off (said she:) True it is, maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> told me of a yoong Gentleman sonne to the knight with the greene sword, that not long since was made knight in the Ferme Isle, <HI>Vrganda</HI> being present, and the next day was carried away in a strange ship, of whome as then they could beare no newes.

My lord (saied <HI>Carmelle</HI>) God preserue your grace: &amp; with∣out further honour vnto him, shee stoode still and held her peace, whereat all the company began to smile, thinking that want of ciuilitie caused her to forget her selfe. But not long after they changed their opinion, <HI>Carmelle</HI> beginning to speak in this ma∣ner. My lord, I haue beene nourished all my life among the best knights liuing in y<SUP>e</SUP> world, yet let not your grace find it strange, if at the first (being in your maiesties presence) I haue vsed so lit∣tle honour to your grace, whereby your Gentlemen should haue cause to laugh at mee: For that want of vnderstanding howe to behaue my selfe in presence of so great a Prince is not the cause thereof, but onely the ioy I conceiue in my selfe, to bee a seruant vnto him, whom I more estéeme then any man liuing: and I on∣ly hold for my lord and maister, not knowing any worthier then he. And if it pleaseth your grace to know who it is, together with the cause of my arriuall in this countrey, I pray you send for the two knights that brought mée hether, &amp; I will shew such things, whereat (it may be) your grace will be abashed. Gentlewoman (saied the Emperour) you shall therein doe mee great pleasure. Wherewith hee commanded a Gentleman to goe fetch the two straunge knights, who comming into the Emperours presence, hauing kissed his handes, and he welcommed them in courteous manner, he willed two chaires to bee brought, wherein hee set them, being a Prince that alwaies entertained straungers with great honour, especially if hee knew them to be of forraine coun∣tries. That done, all the knights, Gentlewomen, and ladies went néere to heare the Gentlewomans spéech, when shee tur∣ning vnto the Emperour, said in this manner: My lord, I thinke your grace hath long before this time knowne the castle, called <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> the which (during the life of valiant <HI>Char∣tadaque,</HI> and since that time) you and the king of Turkie haue di∣uers time assailed to winne, although in vaine, it hath alwaies been so well defended by the Giants <HI>Matroco</HI> and <HI>Frerion,</HI> yet in one day a knight alone hath conquered it, &amp; slain the two giants

And to the end your grace may knowe how all hath happened: it is so (saied shee) that <HI>Arcabonne</HI> (who as then I serued) hauing intelligence of her brothers imprisonment in the Ferme Isle, departed ex∣pressely from the castle, hoping to deliuer him, but before she got thether, he was set at liberty. Notwithstanding (she being loth to loose her labour) to bee reuenged thereof, did so much by her art, that she got king <HI>Luisart</HI> (as then hunting in the forrest) into her tent, the king thinking to succour a Gentlewoman, that as hee thought a knight would haue defloured: where he was so cruelly inchaunted, that losing all his sences, hee was transported with∣out any mans knowledge into the dungeon of the castle, where my lord and maister found him. And continuing her discourse, she shewed in what manner <HI>Esplandian</HI> was made knight, and sée∣king to find the king, hée was carried by the boat of the great ser∣pent into the Isle of the Enchauntresse, where he conquered the shining sword, and after that brought in a little barke to the foote of the rocke called <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> the spéech hee had with the Hermite, the combates with <HI>Argantes, Matroco,</HI> and <HI>Frerion,</HI> the desperatenesse of <HI>Arcabonne,</HI> the determination she had to kil him, when she found him sléeping in the hermitage, y<SUP>e</SUP> loue wher∣with she was sodainly surprised. And lastly, the means how king <HI>Luisart</HI> knew him: for my lord (said she) he is son of <HI>Amadis</HI> his son, and of the Princesse <HI>Oriane.</HI> And because at his departure frō his father, he gaue him in cōmandement to come &amp; serue the Princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> your doughter, with the other ladies, according to his promise, he hath expressely sent me hether, humbly beséeching thē to pardon the slow performance of his fathers wil: but to amend his fault committed, he will shortly be here to fulfill his charge as long as pleaseth thē.

<PB REF="46"/> you haue shewed such strange things of his son, that I certaine∣ly beléeue he farre surpasseth him. He shall bée heartely welcome when he commeth, but if my daughter will follow my counsell, she shall not pardon his long absence till he come in person to de∣sire the same: and let him bee assured hee shall not depart so soone from hence as <HI>Amadis</HI> hath done. At the least, we will make him so good cheare, and my doughter likewise, to whome I giue ex∣presse commandement to doe it, that hee shall not haue occasion to dislike our company. Mean time the two knights shal remain with vs for pledges, assuring you I will giue them all the honor and good intertainement that I can deuise. My lord (said shee) the desire they had to vnderstand the things declared to your grace, hath caused them for to come hether, with whome by great good fortune I met, for <HI>Frandalo,</HI> whom he (pointing to <HI>Manely</HI>) hath most valiantly conquered, had taken mee prisoner, not farre off from the place where I first imbarked: but as fortune would, there rose so great a storme at sea, that all his vessels seperated one from the other, his ship was cast vpon an Island, wherein (by the same tempest) these two knights not long before arriued. And with that shee shewed what spéech they had with <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and what passed betwéene them: Wherefore my lord, acquiting my promise made vnto them, I haue at large declared the aduen∣tures of the good knight their companion. In faith (saied the Em∣perour) they haue shewed themselues right valiant knights, and made a worthy present vnto my doughter, for which I giue them thankes. My Lord (said <HI>Manely</HI>) wée humbly beséech your grace, that from henceforth you will accept his seruice, for it is his only desire, as he hath promised vs. Is that possible (saied the Empe∣rour?) For he is the vildest villaine that euer liued on earth, and hath more wronged my subiects then euer any did. My lord (saied the king of Denmarke) he will become a new man, and there∣fore my companion did present him to your daughter, which pro∣mised for to saue his life, which we beséech your grace likewise to performe. I am content to doe it (said the Emperour) at your re∣quests, though he deserues it not. While they sat talking, <HI>Gastil∣les</HI> that staied in the forrest to looke vnto the hounds, entred into
<PB REF="46"/> the hal, and presently knew <HI>Manely</HI> &amp; the king of Denmark, ha∣uing séene thē in great Brittain before they were made knights, where with hee asked when they came thether, and being made acquainted with the Gentlewomans message, he asked her if she knew the names of the other two that staied in the castle: for sée∣ing they are armed (saied he vnto <HI>Manely</HI>) in the like armes, it is certaine they are of your company. That is true (saied the Gen∣tlewoman) for they were all made knights together, the one cal∣led <HI>Ambor,</HI> the other <HI>Talanque,</HI> I know them wel (said <HI>Gastilles</HI>) for <HI>Ambor</HI> is the sonne of <HI>Angriote d'estrauaulx,</HI> one of the best knights in the country of great Brittaine. In truth (said <HI>Mane∣ly</HI>) wee were in great care how to finde them out, but séeing they are in the castle called <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> if it pleaseth the Emperour, we will goe vnto them. I am content (said he) so you promise mee not to depart before eight daies are past. My lord (said they) wee are at your commandement.

Is it possible Gentlewo∣man (said she) you louing the knight with the black armes so w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l as you report, that you could leaue his company so soon? Madame
<PB REF="47"/> (saied shee) I was presently giuen to vnderstand hee loueth ano∣ther: wherewith I comforted my selfe, iudging his hart like vn∣to mine own, that he could not chuse but sometimes féele the like swéet passion he caused mée indure. What hope then resteth (said the Princesse) vnto you? The same (said shée) I know to be farre different betwéene him and mee, for when I am in presence, be∣holding the excellency of his person, I then receiue some com∣fort, which to him is vtterly denied, séeing that already hee indu∣reth for her sake, that as yet he neuer saw, and the (madame said she) is your owne person, as I said before. Surely (said the Prin∣cesse) his loue is very strange, the foundation whereof I cannot well conceiue. Madame (said <HI>Carmelle</HI>) I feare ere it be long, hee will not be able to indure the great extreamitie wherein he now is fallen, onely for your sake specially, if at his arriuall here, hee find himselfe reiected of your grace, hauing no desire, but to fulfill your pleasure, whereby he may account himselfe your own, estée∣ming it the greatest fauour that euer hee can haue. In good faith (said she) I will not refuse him to small a thing, nor a greater, as occasion serues, but I pray you tell mée why hee calleth himselfe the blacke knight. That can I not well doe (said <HI>Carmelle</HI>) onely that vpon a night as king <HI>Luisart</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor,</HI> were all asléepe in one chamber, they heard so pleasant a sound of mu∣sicke from the sea, that they rose out of their beds to heare it, and it was so darke the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could not s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, but when day appeared, they e∣spied the great Serpent at the Hauen, whereat they were so glad, that descending downe the hill, they went vnto the shoare, where they perceiued a Gentlewoman in a little boat comming to land, bearing in her armes a packe couered with blew Taffa∣ta: which from her mistresse <HI>Vrganda</HI> shée presented to <HI>Esplandi∣an,</HI> saying vnto him, Sir Knight, my mistresse sendeth you these armes, and willeth you by mee to leaue the same shee gaue you, when you were in sadnesse, and to arme your selfe with these, that beare the deuise of her, which at this day is the beautifullest creature liuing in the world (as <HI>Amadis</HI> your father well did witnesse, when he set the crowne vpon her head.)

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. How newes was brought vnto the Emperour, that Armato king of Turkie had besieged the castle of La montaigne defendu, and of the charge he gaue Frandalo with Manely and the king of Den∣marke to goe succour it.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N manner as you heard before, the two knights of the Ferme Isle and <HI>Carmelle,</HI> staied at Constantinople, where there arriued a certaine shippe, that brought a Squire on message from <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor</HI> to certefie the Emperour, that <HI>Armat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> king of Turkie, aduertised of the death of <HI>Matroco</HI> had besieged the castle, <HI>La montaigne defendu</HI> both by land and sea, desiring him to send some aid, otherwise they should bée constrained to yéeld the same, not hauing victuals nor men for to defend it. The Emperor hea∣ring those newes, and considering the truce betwéene him and the king of Turkes, as also that hee had not any men prepared for to send, neither Gally, Galliace, ship nor Brigandine ready for the sea, stood somewhat in amase. But considering with him∣selfe of what importaunce that Frontier castle might bee vnto him if the enemy should obtaine it, he determined by all meanes to hinder him from the same. Wherfore calling for <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and taking him aside, he said vnto him: Well <HI>Frandalo,</HI> you are now my prisoner, and it lieth in me either to hang you like a théefe, or deliuer you with greater riches then euer you possessed, which I promise you to doe, if from this time forwards you sweare to bee my loiall subiect, and faithfully to serue me when you are imploi∣ed. My lord (saied hee) I beséech your grace wholly to forget the faults by me committed to your Maiestie, swearing of my faith, (if it pleaseth you to pardon my offence) you shal from henceforth
<PB REF="48"/> find a seruant of me, that in time will make you knowe by effect how much I estéeme this fauour at your hands. Will you doe it (said the Emperor?) I and it pleaseth your grace (said he.) What is become of your Nauie (saied the Emperour) that in times past you held vpon the sea? My lord (saied <HI>Frandalo</HI>) the winds &amp; tem∣pests that lately happened on the sea, hath so scattered them, that I can heare no newes of them: Neuerthelesse, I am of opinion, they may easily be brought together, wherewith I will doe your grace seruice, if you thinke good. Doe it then (saied the Emperor) and that with spéed, for I haue determined to raise the greatest army that euer hath been séene, therewith to driue <HI>Armato</HI> king of Turkie out of the Frontiers of my Empire, who not long since hath besieged <HI>La montaigne defendu.</HI> And while my forces are preparing, you with the two knights that of late came he∣ther, shall goe before, and vsing meanes to assemble your men, shall in the meane time giue the Turkes somewhat to doe. My lord (said <HI>Frandalo</HI>) God giue me grace to doe you faithful seruice: then be you ready in the morning (saied he) to depart from hence, wherewith hée commanded <HI>Frand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>os</HI> ship to bee rigged and pre∣pared with al things necessary, and finding <HI>Manely</HI> and the king of Denmarke, he told them that he had receiued news from <HI>Ta∣lanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor</HI> touching the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astle of <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> and what hee had determined to doe as concerning their reléefe, shewing them what had passed betweene him and <HI>Frandalo</HI> tou∣ching the same. Wherefore my good friends (saied hee) because I well perceiue the great desire you haue to sée your companions, me thinketh it were good you imbark your selues with him, who goeth before to aduertise them of the aide I meane to send them. My lord (saied <HI>Manely</HI>) it is our whole desires. In the morning (said the king) you shal haue your bark ready and furnished with all things necessary, and some other of my ships likewise to se∣cond you, attending the great army my selfe dooth meane to bring. But before their departure hee gaue them diuers rich pre∣sents, which they refused, contenting themselues with the honor and courteous intertainement hee had already giuen them, and taking their leaue of all the court, especially of the Princesse
<PB REF="49"/> <HI>Leonorine,</HI> they took sea, and <HI>Carmelle</HI> with them, hoping to haue her maisters great good will for the good newes she brought him.

And desiring maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> not to depart thence before hee came againe, hee, <HI>Sergil,</HI> and their two horses entered into a little boat, and taking land, they entered so
<PB REF="49"/> far into the countrey, that they came to a little hill, at the foote whereof they perceiued a goodly meddow, and certaine houses, wherevnto they went. And they had not ridden farre, but a lac∣quie that kept foure horses, whereof one was a Bay, and greater then the rest, came vnto <HI>Esplandian,</HI> and speaking to him in the Almaine tongue, asked him why he went to his own mischiefe? <HI>Esplandian</HI> that in his youth had learned that language, asked him wherefore? Because (said the lacquie) that at the next house my maister is newly alighted, and is at dinner, and if he sée you, you die therefore? Thy maister (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) And what doth he? He vseth (saied he) to kill or put in prison farre brauer fel∣lowes then your selfe: wherefore if you will beléeue me, you shal returne againe, if you mean not to spéed as I haue told you. But <HI>Esplandian</HI> staying not, passed forward till he came vnto the dore, where he espied a Giant set at dinner, and foure squires all bare∣headed waiting on the bord. But as soone as the Giant saw him, hee rose vp, and leaning on the cloth, saied vnto him: Thou vn∣happy wretch, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath sent thée <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther in my presence, armed as thou art?

Forwards you vi∣laines said he vnto his Squires, throw him off his horse, and car∣ry him to his fellows. Wherewith one of them (thinking to play the diligent seruant) ranne vnto <HI>Esplandian,</HI> to serue him for a Squire: but (whether <HI>Esplandian</HI> was offended, or for that hee held the left stirrop in stead of the right) hée gaue him such a blow on the face with his Gantelet, that hee felled him to the ground: whereat the Giant was in such a rage, that he scarse had the pa∣tience to arme himselfe to bee reuenged. Wherefore sending to fetch his great Bay horse, mounted thereon. Mean time <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> lacing his helmet, tooke his sword in hand, staying for his e∣nemy that ceased not to threaten him, who staied not long before he came, bearing a great launce vpon his thigh, and so great a ci∣mitere hanging at his saddle bow, y<SUP>t</SUP> a straunge man would haue much adoe to lift it vp. But as you sée a Cocke holding vp his

But the Giant called him and said, Vassaile, Content thy selfe with the honour thou hast alrea∣dy gotten, by putting me in so great choler, that without any re∣gard I haue taken armes against so vile and wretched a thing as thou art: Flie then from hence without constraining me to do thée any hurt, otherwise thou art most sure of death, for twenty knights hardier then thy selfe, cannot once remoue me. <HI>Esplandi∣an</HI> hearing his great brags, made no account thereof, but in moc∣kery said vnto him. Those thou hast already slaine, can neuer hurt thée, but I that come for to reuenge them, hope before that wee depart to send thy soule vnto the diuell, to whome thou hast commended it so often, although it were much better for thée to take the counsell thou hast giuen me, and shun thine own misfor∣tune, being well assured, that in thy great mishapen body there resteth nothing but a base an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seruile heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat causeth thée to speake in such sort a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou doest. That shalt thou presently see (said the Giant) and couching his laun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, ranne towards <HI>Esplan∣dian,</HI> who did the like against him: But the Giant missed his blow, so did not <HI>Esplandian,</HI> for with the force of his blow he made the Giant double his body, in such sort, that his Gaule brake in his body, and ranne out at his mouth, where with hee presently died. They that beheld it were thereat abashed, specially the Gi∣ants Squires, who presently began to flie, but they had not run farre, when <HI>Esplandian</HI> ouertooke them, threatning to slay them if they would not shewe him the place where their maister kept his prisoners, which they promised to do. And leading him along by the foot of the hill from whence hee had descended, they came into a narrow way full of stones, where stood a watch of twen∣ty men all armed, each man with a hatchet in his hand to defend the passage. When the captain of that band perceiued the giants squires comming towards them, hée asked thē where they found that vnhappy fellow, and saying so, thought to lay handes vpon <HI>Esplandians</HI> bridle, but with a blow of his sword hee cut his arme
<PB REF="50"/> in sunder, wherewith the rest set all vpon him. But in short time he dealt so well among them, that hée laid most part of them dead vpon the ground. But he had so many men about him, that in the end his horse was slaine, and he in danger to be ouerthrown. Yet hee behaued himselfe so valiantly, and with so great a courage, that hee remained victor, his enemies flying as fast as possibly they might: and among the rest, the laquie that he found kéeping the foure horses, who sauing himselfe in a vaut, cried with a loud voice and saied, Come forth my lord, come forth, your sonne <HI>Bra∣mato</HI> is slaine, and all our companions likewise. With that there appeared a great old Giant with a long white beard, who séeing <HI>Esplandian</HI> with his sword bloody in his hand, and most of his men lying dead about him, he cast out a great sigh and said, O immor∣tall Gods, wherein haue I so much offended you, that you should suffer my only sonne and all my men to be slaine in such manner by this one knight? But I hope your wraths wil not be so much increased against me, as that you will not giue me leaue to be re∣uenged on him. And as hee vttered those words, beeing couered with his shield, hee went vnto <HI>Esplandian,</HI> and holding his sword in hand, stroke him flatl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng with the same vpon the arme, in such maner that he was astonished: and with the force of the blow the sword sliding downe vpon a stone, brake in thrée péeces, where∣with <HI>Esplandian</HI> stepped to him, and with great dexterity strooke him so fiercely on the face, that the blood in great abundance ran out of his forehead. Whereat the Giant was in such a rage, that casting downe his shield, tooke the péece of his sword in both his hands, and with all his force strooke at <HI>Esplandian</HI> that stept aside, and perceiuing the Giants arme comming towards him, with one blow cut off his hand, whereby his sword fell downe. Neuer∣thelesse he séemed not abashed, but imbracing <HI>Esplandian</HI> with his left arme, thought to crush the breath out of his body, but it hap∣pened otherwise, for as hee held him, <HI>Esplandian</HI> hauing his right arme at libertie, thrust his sword into the Giants body, where∣with he died. Thē calling <HI>Bramatos</HI> thrée squires that he brought thether to shew him the prisoners, hee asked where they were: My lord said one of them, on that side the vaut is the two Giants
<PB REF="51"/> lodgings, that you haue slaine, and vnder it are the prisoners that you séeke in a most darke prison aboue a hundred paces long, and but two paces broad, whereby the prisoners (in great number) haue no meanes to rest themselues, beeing constrained to stand vpright for the narrownesse of the place. Goe before (said <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI>) with that the squire went forward, and <HI>Esplandian</HI> followed after, and they had not gone long, but they entred into a goodly pallace, and going lower, hee heard the lamentable voices of the poore prisoners dying for want of food, whereat he tooke such com∣passion, that the teares ran downe his eies, asking the squire for the keies? there they hang (said he) vpon a naile. Open the dore (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) which he presently did, wherein they entred, and <HI>Esplandian</HI> calling the poore wretches that lamented, saied vnto them. My good friends, come all forth, and thanke God for your liberties. You may well iudge if they were glad to heare those newes, for that some of them had remained therein aboue thirtie yeares together, being in all twenty Gentlewomen, thirtie squires, and fiftie knights, among the which <HI>Esplandian</HI> knewe <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Lazinde,</HI> who by euill fortune (after the conquest of <HI>Sansuegue</HI>) trauailing the country, were met by the Giants, and kept in prison with the rest, where they indured great miserie.</P>

The next day in the morning <HI>Esplandian</HI> called the prisoners that he had deliuered, asking them what they meant to doe? Sir Knight (saied they) wee are wholly bent to doe as pleaseth you.

You and he (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) shall kéepe mee company till you meane to trauaile further, the rest shall doe as I required them. Sir Knight (saied hee) that shewed him the pri∣son, they shall finde within the house all the furnitures and other things that were taken from them: shew them where they be (said <HI>Esplandian.</HI>) Wherevnto he willingly obayed, which done, they all left the Giants house, the prisoners taking the way to∣wards Constantinople, and <HI>Esplandian</HI> with <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>La∣zinde,</HI> armed at all points, went towards maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> that stayed for them in the great Serpent, and as they were about halfe a mile from the Giants house, they met a knight all armed with two squires attending on him, who in courteous manner saluting <HI>Esplandian</HI> and his company, asked them what countrey men they were. Sir knight (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) wee are all of great Brittaigne. Alas (said he) can you tell me any newes touching a thing that hath gréeued me full sore? What is that (saied <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI>) can you tell mee (saied hee) what is become of king <HI>Luisart?</HI> For I haue ben certefied of a truth that hee is lost, not knowing where, how, nor for what cause.

My lords (saied hee, putting off his helmet) I am <HI>No∣randel</HI> his sonne. When <HI>Esplandian</HI> and the rest perceiued that, they made themselues knowne vnto him, imbracing each other most curteously. Ha m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lord (said <HI>Norandel</HI>) I pray you for Gods cause, if you know any thing touching the king, hide it not from me. Vncle (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) about a moneth hence I left him at Mirefleur in good health God bee thanked, making good cheare: shewing him in what maner hée had deliuered him out of prison, wiih all that passed touching the same. I maruaile then (said <HI>No∣randel</HI>) what aduenture brought you hether. By my soule (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) that can I not well tell, only that I was brought he∣ther by the great Serpent which I left at the sea side, wherein maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> staieth for me. Then hee shewed him how hee departed from the court, his arriuall in the Ferme Isle, his im∣barking to take sea, and what time they were at sea before they discouered any land, till in the end (saied hee) we espied this coun∣try, where <HI>Sergil</HI> and I tooke land, in good time for <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Lazinde,</HI> as hereafter they may shew you. But you (saied hee to <HI>Norandel</HI>) tell me of your faith, how was it your chance in so good time to méet with vs? In truth (saied <HI>Norandel</HI>) the peace made betwéene <HI>Amadis</HI> and the king, I departed from the court to séek some strange aduentures that commonly are found in this coun∣try of Almaigne, where I had no sooner arriued, but I had cer∣taine newes of my fathers absence, whereat I was so gréeued, that to find him out I haue trauailed the countries of Denmark, Poland, Russia, Sweathland, Hungarie, and all this country e∣uen vnto this place, where it is said there dwels two giants, who as they are all of one nature, exercise innumerable cruelties a∣gainst those they méete, the yonger of them waiting continually
<PB REF="52"/> about this place for such as passe this way. And therefore when I saw you first, I thought one of you thrée to be the Giant, thin∣king to fight with him, or lose my life therefore: which I wil yet doe if you let me passe. By God (saied <HI>Gandalin</HI>) you lost your la∣bour séeking for the king, so shall you likewise doe if you take this enterprise in hand? Wherefore (saied <HI>Norandel,</HI>) Because (saied he) you sée him here in presence that easeth you of that bur∣then. With that he shewed him in what manner <HI>Esplandian</HI> had fought with the Giants, and how he, <HI>Lazinde,</HI> and diuerse others were prisoners in their house, from whence <HI>Esplandian</HI> had deli∣uered them. Before God (saied <HI>Norandel</HI>) the newes liketh mee wel, for I neuer thought in long time any such aduenture would haue happened vnto him, not knowing he had receiued the order of knighhood. You sée it is so (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) and maister <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> can tell you more, if it pleaseth you to goe with vs. Let vs goe then (said <HI>Norandel</HI>) for I would gladly sée him: With that they rode towards the sea, till they espied the great Serpent, wherein they imbarked themselues: where <HI>Norandel, Gandalin,</HI> and <HI>Lazinde,</HI> vnderstood by master <HI>Elizabeth</HI> what had happened to <HI>Esplandian</HI> from the day hee receiued the order of knighthood. And although <HI>Norandel</HI> determined with all spéed to return into great Brittaigne, yet hee chaunged his mind when hee heard so strange and maruailous news of his nephew <HI>Esplandian,</HI> to whō he said: My lord, séeing fortune hath brought vs so well together, I pray you let me not leaue your company till some occasion bee ministred vnto vs. Vncle (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) I am content, and I pray you let it be so. In that manner they passed the rest of the day in the great Serpent, minding the next day because shée stir∣red not to take land againe to sée if they could finde any more ad∣uentures: And they had scarse fallen asléepe, but the Serpent be∣gan of it selfe to saile forward so swiftly, that by sunne rising they had lost the sight of any land, not ceasing for to saile sixe daies together before they espied land: the seuenth day when the sunne began to shine, it staied at the Isle Saint <HI>Mary,</HI> which maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> presently knew, as hauing ben there before with <HI>Ama∣dis de Gaule,</HI> when he fought with <HI>Landriaque:</HI> wherefore he saied
<PB REF="53"/> vnto the knights. In good faith, I remember that once as I tra∣uailed on the sea with my lord <HI>Amadis,</HI> wee were cast vpon this Island by so great a tempest, that we thought verily to haue béen drowned. And if then at sea wee had great feare of death, béeing landed, our feare did more increase, and that with so good cause, that I cannot chuse but tremble to remember it. What (saied <HI>E∣splandian?</HI>) Can a danger so long time past bréed so great a feare as you séeme to haue? Sir (saied maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI>) some men to hide the truth, make a great matter of a small, but if you had séen as much as I then saw, and that which as yet you may behold, if it pleaseth you to goe where I was once, you shall find that I haue no lesse occasion, and there is <HI>Gandalin</HI> that can witnesse it as wel as I. I pray you bring vs thether (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) with that they caused the horses to be vnshipt, and going to land, they mounted vp the Island, til they came to the castle where <HI>Amadis</HI> staied certain daies to be healed of his wounds, where they found a knight that kept it forthe Emperour, who being aduertised by maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> what knights they were hee had brought thether, bad them heartely welcome, offering them all the plea∣sure he could shew, but they staying not there, went forwards to the place where <HI>Amadis</HI> fought with <HI>Landriaque,</HI> where the Em∣perour had erected both their Images so like vnto them, y<SUP>t</SUP> there wanted only life to expresse the same: Which maister <HI>Elizabeth</HI> shewed vnto the knights, and to the end (said he) you beléeue mee better another time, I pray you behold well the forme of this great diuell, who before my lord <HI>Amadis</HI> arriued had vtterly de∣stroied this most fertile Island. And therewith hee shewed them from point to point what had passed touching the same, as you haue heard at large set downe in the third booke of this our hysto∣rie, whereat they were all abashed, especially to think how <HI>Lan∣driaque</HI> could bee slaine or ouercome by one knight alone. For although this image were but a sencelesse thing, yet it made thē abashed, which hauing long time beheld, and visiting other pla∣ces worthy memory, they returned to the great Serpent, which presently departed from the Isle, and with a good winde, in fiue daies after arriued within half a mile of Constantinople, where
<PB REF="53"/> it began to cast forth fire in so furious manner, that the saylers and others that perceiued it, fled all away, doubting the fury of that monster, wherewith the Cittizens were in such a feare, that newes was brought vnto the Emperour, who as then was talking with the ladies, whom he led vnto the towers of his pal∣lace to sée what it might be, when they perceiued the great Ser∣pent, and the sea raging so sore about it, that it séemed a gulfe of fire, wherewith they were in such a feare, and the Emperour likewise, that he cōmanded al men to be armed, fearing it would come into the Towne, and so destroy them al. But <HI>Gastilles</HI> that had séene it oftentimes, assured the Emperour that it was y<SUP>e</SUP> ship of the knight <HI>Esplandian,</HI> which <HI>Vrganda</HI> brought first into great Brittaigne. And to the end my lord (saied hee) you shall not doubt thereof, if it pleaseth you I will goe sée if the sonne of <HI>Amadis</HI> be there, and bring him vnto you. Doe so I pray you (saied the Em∣perour.) With that <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stilles</HI> went vnto the Hauen, entring into a Gally that hee found ready to put to sea, commanding the mai∣ster thereof to row vnto the great Serpent, but whatsoeuer hee could say, the maister would not stirre one foote, till such time hee threatned him with feare of being hanged. Wherefore hoising vp his anker, the company began to row forward, but it was im∣possible for them to come neare the Serpent by a good bow shot, and withall the sea it was so hie, that the waues cast them backe againe into the Hauen with so great a force, that the Gally was in danger to bee cast away. Which the Princesse <HI>Leonorine</HI> per∣ceiuing, (who till then thought assuredly <HI>Esplandian</HI> had expresse∣ly come thether for to sée her) began to despaire of her good hope, and making her complaint, saied vnto her selfe: Alas monster, ship, Gally, or what vessell soeuer thou art, wherefore art thou now so cruell vnto me, in not suffering him that is within thée to land at this our Hauen, to the end mine eies might enioy his presence, but rather as if thou haddest conceiued a iealousie to∣wards vs, thou vsest all meanes possible to hinder the ship wher∣in my cousin <HI>Gastilles</HI> saileth, not to approch neare thee, that hee might bring him hether, or at the least that wée might hear some newes of him. But in faith, all well waied and considred, I think
<PB REF="54"/> thee rather to haue reason, and my selfe without consideration, for that so excellent a thing ought not to bee so lightly set at liber∣tie. Therefore it is no meruaile if thou refuse him vnto vs, fea∣ring least thou shouldest loose him, séeing thou maist well vaunt y<SUP>t</SUP> in thée there resteth so valerous knight, as in regard of him all o∣thers may be nought estéemed. I would to God, that wee being both together, might neuer depart out of thy body: for being with him, his only presence would bréed in mée so much contentment, that I should thinke my selfe to haue attained vnto the top of all felicity: and if his loue bee such as <HI>Carmelle</HI> hath assured mee, it cannot be, but that he suffereth the like passion I now indure, by ouermuch desire to sée his person. Wherewith shee remained in such an extasie, that by the changing of her colour, it might easily be iudged her heart was not at ease, which in the end compelled her to sigh: and at the same instant to repent the spéeches she had vsed vnto <HI>Carmelle,</HI> as also of the rich gowne that she gaue vnto her. For (said she vnto her selfe) what know I, if my swéet friend séeing her apparrelled therin, would imbrace her, not for the loue of her, but for the gowne that once belonged vnto mee. And if it be so, it is not to bee doubted, but shee will by all meanes séeke to ioine her lips to his, yea and her body like wise: which would bee worse, séeing she is neither so euill fauoured nor of so bad behaui∣our, but it may be in a heat he would both forget himselfe and me. But out alas what said I? Truly I doe him wrong to bée so iea∣lous of him, considering the chast loue that is betwéene them both, and therefore if it so fall out, that in respect of mee hee shall imbrace her body, beholding her apparrelled in a thing that som∣times serued me, it will bee much more glory vnto me till I my selfe may once imbrace his body, as in time I doubt not but I shall. But if <HI>Leonorine</HI> were in paine, <HI>Esplandian</HI> had no lesse, both sollicited with like iealousie, for the great distrust of their not méeting at that time: and gladly would haue approched née∣rer to each other, had it not béene that the one was on land vnder the gouernement of another man, the other at sea within a ves∣sell which he could not command. In the meane time the great Serpent setting forwards, made such spéede, that in very short
<PB REF="54"/> space it passed the straights of Bosphore. Wherewith the Prin∣cesse <HI>Leonorine</HI> was like to sound, but shée refrained it as much as possible shee might, fearing to manifest that, she most desired to kéepe secret. Whereby she withdrew her selfe halfe dead into her chamber, and making as if she desired to sléepe, threwe her selfe on her bed, commanding her Gentle women to depart the cham∣ber: they being gone, she began againe to renue her sorrow, and almost drowned in teares, said vnto her selfe: Alas, now I surely sée and well perceiue my gréefe to be wholly without remedy, ha∣uing séene the thing (that in all the world I most intirely loue) so néere vnto me, and at one instant so suddainly to depart, that it is vncertaine whether he is gone. Ha cruell torment that still in∣creaseth in me so couertly, is it possible that from henceforth I can so well dissemble as yet I haue done? Truly no, for if in time past I inforced my selfe to estéeme the desire I had a singu∣lar pleasure vnto mee, nowe séeing I well perceiue my accursed fortune to approch, and my ioy to fade, in manner as soone as it was conceiued, I desire nought but death: which to me would be more acceptable, then liue in so great paine, not hoping any ease. And leauing so, shee gaue so great a sigh, that Quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> heard it: Who fearing shee had beene sicke, opened the chamber dore, asking her how she did. Wherewith the Princesse percea∣uing that discouery, to excuse her selfe the best she could, shee told the Quéene shee dreamed. Madame (saied the Quéene) it is not long since the Emperesse sent to sée what you were doing? Is it not your pleasure to rise and goe vnto her? Let vs goe (saied shee.) In the meane time <HI>Esplandian</HI> with his companions, sai∣led so long, that within two daies after they perceiued the rocke of <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> and not farre from them the vessels and men of warre <HI>Frandalo</HI> had assembled, that stayed for a wind to surprise the Turkish Army on the sea: who percea∣uing the great Serpent making towards them, began to arme themselues, thinking that it had beene some monster that came to deuour them. But <HI>Manely</HI> and the King of Den∣marke that had séene it oftentimes before, were very glad, giuing them to vnderstand what succours they might haue
<PB REF="55"/> thereby, whereat they all reioiced, specially when they percei∣ued <HI>Esplandian, Gandalin,</HI> and the rest, that <HI>Manely</HI> and the king of Denmarke knew, wherefore causing a boat to bee made rea∣dy, they with <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Argenton,</HI> the king of Denmarkes Squire (a very good marriner) entered into it, and rowing to the great Serpent, <HI>Esplandian</HI> receiued them with great ioy, asking <HI>Manely</HI> what fortune had brought them thether. In faith (saied he) it is not long since we departed from the citty of Constanti∣nople, to discouer and to hinder the passage of victuals that are daily brought by sea from the Towne of <HI>Norolia</HI> vnto <HI>Armato</HI> king of Turks, who not long sithence hath besieged the castle of <HI>La montaigne defendu:</HI> expecting daily the comming of the Em∣perour with a great army to driue the Turke from thence. But we haue had so contrary a wind, that it hath ben impossible for vs to effect our charge. In good truth (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) I would neuer haue sought you in these countries, neither doe I knowe what became of you after wée fell asléepe in this vessell, I pray you tell it vs. Then <HI>Manely</HI> began to shew how he and the king of Den∣marke when they awaked found themselues in a barke vpon the coast of Italy, where taking land they found <HI>Vrganda,</HI> and after that by cruell tempests they arriued in an Isle, where a Beare assailed them, in which Isle they saw two great apes that shew∣ed them much sport. But (saied hee) wee thought to haue starued therein for want of meat, for our victuals were cleane consumed when by fortune <HI>Frandalo</HI> arriued in the same Isle, with whome I fought and ouercame him. And because our barke was cast a∣way, wee entered into his, wherein wee found a Gentlewoman that told vs newes of you, whom for your sake we conducted vn∣to Constantinople, and from thence haue brought her backe a∣gaine. As farre as I vnderstand (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) you haue not al∣waies slept, and I beléeue that neuer any knight had fo straunge aduentures at their first entering into armes vnlesse it were my lord <HI>Amadis</HI> my father, which I would hardly haue beléeued, had it not ben for the signes and euident tokens that wee saw in the Isle Saint <HI>Mary.</HI> What were they (said the king of Denmark?) We saw the Image of <HI>Landriaque</HI> (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) with whome
<PB REF="55"/> he had so long and perrillous a combate. It is true (saied <HI>Argen∣ton</HI>) that such combates against monsters, doe oftentimes strike the hardiest knights with feare, and the combate of our Apes made sorrowfull knights reioice. In good faith saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) thou hast reason, and I like thée well for thy mirth, but I pray thée heartely returne againe, and fetch the Gentlewoman that is in thy maisters ship, and bring her hether, that I may speake with her, which he presently did: and as she entred into the great Serpent, <HI>Esplandian</HI> imbracing her, asked if she had séene the em∣perour and the beautifull Princesse <HI>Leonorine</HI> his doughter. I my lord (said she) both of them desiring your arriual in that coun∣trey, especially the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> with all the ladies and Gentlewomen, being fully determined not to pardon the great fault you haue committed in their behalfes, to haue deferred off so long before you come to serue them, according to the promise made by <HI>Amadis</HI> your father, as I assured thē. Yet I thinke their displeasure is not so great, but yee may well find meanes to pace∣fie the same. My good friend (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) you are heartely welcome, wee will talke together when better leisure serueth. Which he said, fearing she should haue procéeded further, where∣with the standers by might haue intelligence of the loue he bare vnto the Princesse, wherefore leauing the Gentlewoman, and turning to <HI>Manely,</HI> hee saied: In faith I cannot well excuse my selfe, but that I doe them wrong, for the first commaundement my father gaue mee at such time I receiued the order of knight∣hood was, that in his place I should goe and serue them, to quit the promise he had made. Neuertheles fortune hath euer sithence giuen mee so many crosses thereby to hinder my intent, that I could neither fulfill his wil, nor satisfie their expectations. While they were thus deuising, two of <HI>Frandalos</HI> Brigantines, that by him were sent to espy the enemies nauy, brought news they had séene great numbers of their Foistes and Gallies sailing to the East, to fetch victuals for the Nauie, and that the rest that re∣mained behind would easily bee ouercome, if it pleased them to set vpon them: which the knights vnderstanding, were of opi∣nion, that without longer delay they would assaile them, and
<PB REF="56"/> presently therewith hoised vp their ankers, making as secretly as they could towards <HI>Armatos</HI> fléete, yet they determined not to set vpon them before the breake of day, hoping to take them slée∣ping, which in truth fell out. The first that set vpon them was the great Serpent, that at her arriuall, entering among the ene∣mies, cast fire so fiercely at her mouth and nosthrils, that when they awaked it put them in such feare, that losing courage with∣out stroke giuen, they all began to flie: Neuerthelesse it could not saue their liues, but that the greatest part of their vessels were drowned by meanes of a contrary wind, that rose so suddainely on the sea, whereby it raged in such sort, that neither mast, sayle, bord, nor oare could holde, but were broken all in péeces: yet did not <HI>Frandalo</HI> lose any of his fléet, neither did the camp once moue thereat, for they were not séene of any other then the sentinell of the castle, that presently told <HI>Ambor</HI> and <HI>Talanque,</HI> wherat they receiued great pleasure, especially when they espied the great Serpent and <HI>Esplandian</HI> there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with whome they talked long time before hee came to land. At the last they concluded to auoid all danger, that the rampiers they had made before the gate, should for that time not bee broken, but they would let down a la∣ther of cords, whereby they might mount vp into the castle, <HI>Fran∣dalo</HI> hauing giuen order for the safetie of his shippes, which was presently done.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat aid entred into the castle of <HI>La montaigne defendu, Esplandian</HI> desirous to sée the enemies campe, presently mounted vpon the wals, accompanied only of <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor,</HI> that shewed him the tents of <HI>Armato,</HI> the Bassias, Begberbeys, and Sangiaces, whereof some were lod∣ged within the Base court, which they had conquered at their
<PB REF="56"/> first comming thether, wherwith <HI>Esplandian</HI> was much gréeued, and asked <HI>Talanque</HI> how he suffered them to come so néer. Assure your selfe (said he) it was not with our wils, but we defended it as long as possible wee might, and the Portaile like wise, which at their first comming they assailed. But we defended it so well, that without their mine they had neuer won it, yet did it profite them but little, for that sodainly wee destroied all their mine, that had cost them fiftéen daies labour. Which <HI>Armato</HI> perceiuing, sought to begin againe, which we by diuers sallies would not suffer him to doe: but whatsoeuer we could doe, in the end their force preuai∣led, and wee constrained to forsake the same, and retire vnto the castle, and that in good time, for we were scarse entered into the dungeon, but they fired it, whereby the Portall fell downe, gi∣uing vs at that time one of the most cruell assaults that euer place sustained, being so meanely guarded as it was, and assure your selfe, that there is neither loopehole nor window, but they raised ladders or some other engins against it, and with launces, fire, and sword, gaue vs so much to doe, that we were in doubt to be ouercome. Neuerthelesse they were as whotely repulsed, for <HI>Libee</HI> gaue them such intertainement with a dramme of pouder, that hee set on fire, as they began to crie out victorie, but vpon a suddain their cry became so pittifull, that nothing but sorrow and lamentation could be heard among them, where with there were so many of them burnt and singed, that neuer since they durst ap∣proch so néere, although wee haue giuen them diuers skirmishes, but for the space of eight daies we neuer issued foorth, by reason (as you know) if wee should often issue foorth, it is impossible but some of our men must of force bee slaine, and the death of one of ours would be more losse vnto vs then the slaying of a hundreth of their men would profite vs. You haue done well (said <HI>Esplandi∣an</HI>) for all wise captaines ought to content themselues with the sure defending of a hold committed vnto them, not hazarding themselues to losse as long as possible they may. But for the fur∣ther safetie of this castle, I thinke it good wee take counsell what were best to bee done, least wee bee surprised. Wherewith they went into the chamber where <HI>Matroco</HI> died, where they met to∣gether,
<PB REF="57"/> and (among diuers things propounded) it was concluded, that y<SUP>e</SUP> next night they would issue forth to slay y<SUP>e</SUP> enemies watch, which would easily bee done, séeing they had not any alarme in long time before. Wherefore euery man went to refresh himself, till about eleuen of the clocke at night, when <HI>Frandalo</HI> and the rest armed themselues. And as they were all assembled in the court, <HI>Esplandian</HI> standing in the middle, spake vnto them and saied, My good friendes, wee are not now among the combates of great Brittaigne, where combates are fought more for fantasie, or vaine glory, then vpon any iust occasion: But this warre wee make against the proper enemies of our faith, summoneth vs not onely to doe our indeuours, but also to defend the honour and liberty of the name of Christians. Wherefore my good compani∣ons, I beséech you let euery man cast feare aside, preferring ver∣tue before any inconuenience whatsoeuer. Assuring you (if wee doe so) that before it be day, king <HI>Armato</HI> and his army shall well find, we are not so fainthearted as he estéemeth vs. Then calling <HI>Norandel</HI> vnto him, he said: Vncle, you, <HI>Manely</HI> and the king of Denmarke with a hundred men, shall issue first to flay the Sen∣tinels, and if you could doe the like vnto their watch, our enter∣prise would bee brought to passe as wee desire. But whatsoeuer chanceth, set you vpon them, and feare not the repulse, for <HI>Gan∣dalin</HI> and <HI>Lazinde</HI> shall second you with two hundreth more, by which meanes you may easily retire if you be constrained there∣vnto. Neuerthelesse, let no man stirre from hence, till <HI>Frandalo</HI> and I be first gone out, for that wée two alone will goe into their campe to sée what countenance they make, and as fortune fauou∣reth vs, we will presently ioine with you. With that hee sent for two gownes of cloth of gold, and two Turkish caps, whereof he gaue one vnto <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and kept the other for himselfe, and be∣ing armed vnder their apparrell, were set downe (by the ladder of oords) on the sea side, &amp; fainting to be some of the sea captaines, went straight vnto the campe, where they were staied by the Sentinels, but <HI>Frandalo</HI> speaking the Arabian tongue, could so well dissemble, that hee made them beléeue, they went to aduer∣tise the great Turke of a thing of great importance, whereby
<PB REF="57"/> they let them passe. Meane time <HI>Armato</HI> king of Turky sate de∣uising in his tent with his familiar friendes, touching the losse of ships, whereof not aboue an hower before, he had receiued news by one of his marriners, that saued himselfe in a small Frigate: but the Turke could not by any meanes imagine how it came to passe, séeing his spies that were newly returned from Constanti∣nople, had brought him newes that the Emperour stirred not, neither made any preparation to assaile him. And as <HI>Frandalo</HI> &amp; <HI>Esplandian</HI> entred the tent, they heard the marriner tell how that cruell ouerthrow happened by meanes of a monster of the sea, that came with the enemies fléet. That (saied hee) put vs in such fear, with casting fire out of his mouth, nose, and eies, that there∣by the most part of our men were burnt to ashes. By all my gods (said <HI>Armato</HI>) it is some diuell that enuieth my prosperitie. And it pleaseth your grace said one of his Bassaes, (that had sailed in the mediteranian seas, and heard speaking of the great Serpent) there is nothing but art Magicke vsed therein, whereof I am most sure, as hauing diuers times ben certefied thereof. Where∣with they heard a great alarum, for <HI>Norandel</HI> and his company had issued out of the castle with white scarffes about their heads for to bee knowne, and had so well surprised the watch about the base court, that they had slaine them all, whereof <HI>Armato</HI> had in∣telligence, as also that the enemies had gotten the issue of the Portall, wherewith hee was so moued, that in a great rage with very small company he went thether himselfe, <HI>Esplandian</HI> &amp; <HI>Fran∣dalo</HI> following after, as if they had been of his company. But be∣fore their arriuall, <HI>Norandel</HI> had recouered the pallasadoes of the fortresse, and there sustained the whole Turkish forces, staying <HI>Gandalins</HI> comming. Now the entry of the court was so narow, that more then thrée men could not passe through it at once, wherby those of the castle had in manner as much aduantage as their enemies. Which <HI>Ambor, Talanque, Gandalin,</HI> and <HI>Libee</HI> made them well féele, comming likewise vpon them, for as the king arriued, they thrust them cleane out of the place, whereby they fled in great hast, till the Turke himselfe caused them to stay, and séeing him, they tooke courage, turning their faces,
<PB REF="58"/> whereby the skirmish began much whotter then before, <HI>Armato</HI> himselfe shewing great Prowesse, when <HI>Esplandian</HI> that was stil behind him, tooke him by the middle, and in dispight of them all, carried him vnto the wals of che castle, crying with a lowd voice, Bee of good cheare my companions, wee haue taken the king. At the which crie the Turkes set so fiercely on them, that had it not ben for <HI>Frandalo</HI> (who as yet had not shewed himselfe) they had recouered him againe, but he ioyned himselfe with <HI>Ma∣nely, Norandel,</HI> and the rest that sustained the force of all the ene∣mies so valiantly, that <HI>Esplandian</HI> had meanes to put <HI>Armato</HI> in sure kéeping, and to returne againe vnto the battaile before it was ended. But it continued not long after, for that newes was presently carried to the campe, that the king was prisoner with two of his chiefe captaines, taken by <HI>Gandalin</HI> and the king of Denmarke, wherewith they were so much abashed, that by lit∣tle and little they began to retire, the like did they of the castle, contenting themselues with the booty they had gotten.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. How Armato king of Turkie was committed vnto the custody of Gandalin, and what conference he had with Frandalo.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hose of the castle retired, as you heard be∣fore, <HI>Esplandian</HI> called <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Libee</HI> praying them to looke vnto king <HI>Armato,</HI> as also to the two Turkish captaines, and appointing the watch as time required, went and laied him downe vpon his bed, not ceasing all the night to thinke on the spéech <HI>Carmelle</HI> vsed vnto him touching the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> whereby hee could not sléepe till day be∣gan to appeare, when <HI>Frandalo</HI> and the rest of his knights entred into his chamber, to talke with him, not only as touching the in∣tertainement of their prisoners, but of other thinges that much imported them. And as they were in counsell together, <HI>Gandalin</HI>
<PB REF="58"/> came vnto them, shewing them that king <HI>Armato</HI> desired for to speake with them, wherevpon they went out of the chamber to heare what hee would say. <HI>Frandalo</HI> could speake the Arabian tongue better then the rest, for that hee had serued the king of Turkie, and hee knew him very well, wherefore <HI>Esplandian</HI> desi∣red him to speake for all the rest. And entring into the chamber, <HI>Frandalo</HI> went first, who knéeling on the ground, kissed y<SUP>e</SUP> kings hand. With that <HI>Armato</HI> thinking hee had beene prisoner, asked him where he was taken. My lord (saied he) I am now become a Christian, and a knight of Iesus Christ, that hath done mee so much grace, not long time since to call mee to bee one of his. A Christian (said the king) is that possible? By my soule it maketh mee more abashed, then the cruell fortune that is now happened vnto mee: for that all knights following armes ought patiently to beare those hazards that they fall into, vsing necessitie as a vertue. But thou vnhappy wretch (that through feare and want of courage) hast forsaken our iust and holy law, wherefore takest thou not a rope and hangest thy selfe, as vnworthy to goe vpon the earth? My lord (saied hee) you may say what pleaseth you, as being priueledged for the greatnesse of your estate, yet I can as∣sure you, I neuer had so cowardly a heart as you estéeme I haue, but rather account my selfe happie to haue done that I haue done. Yet will I not refuse to doe you seruice (my honour still re∣serued) in any thing I can. With that <HI>Armato</HI> remembred him∣selfe, and thought hee did him wrong, wherefore moderating his choler, he saied vnto him: Friend <HI>Frandalo,</HI> If it gréeueth mee to haue lost you, let it not séeme strange vnto you, séeing now I had greater hope then euer I haue had to bée serued by your meanes. But séeing it is so, you knowe howe I haue vsed you heretofore, now I pray you (if you may doe any thing for mee) to finde the meanes with your companions that I may bee deliuered from hence by some reasonable composition. My lord (saied <HI>Frandalo,</HI> pointing to <HI>Esplandian</HI>) This is hee that hath all power and au∣thoritie in this place, both ouer you and mee. With that <HI>Armato</HI> looked vpon him, and perceiuing him so yoong without a beard, thought <HI>Frandalo</HI> saied it to excuse himselfe, wherefore hee asked
<PB REF="59"/> if he mocked him. God forbid I should doe so my lord (saied <HI>Fran∣dalo</HI>) but I pray you beléeue me, for it is true, that my lord <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> standing here before you is he and none other that slew <HI>Ma∣troco, Frerion, Arcalaus</HI> the inchanter, and <HI>Argantes</HI> the Porter of the castle, which hee conquered, as you haue been aduertised. By my head (saied the king) I would hardly haue estéemed him for so braue a man: but séeing it is so, I pray thee doe somewhat with him touching the thing I told you of euen now. Beléeue mée my lord (said <HI>Frandalo</HI>) there shall want no good will in me: and with that hee bad him God morrow, and leauing him with his guard, they went into the hall, where they found the tables ready coue∣red for dinner, for it was about noone time. But as <HI>Esplandian</HI> re∣sted ill that night, so hee made but a meane dinner, not being able to withdraw his mind from thinking on the princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> which was the cause that the Tables being vncouered, hee went into his chamber, without any company, onely the king of Den∣marke, whom he loued as himselfe, where being together, he be∣gan to shew him the cause why he sent <HI>Carmelle</HI> to Constantino∣ple, as also what affection hee bare to the Princesse <HI>Leonorine.</HI> And to the end (said he) you bee participant of my ioy, I pray you let vs haue her here, that shee may shew vs what shee learned in her voyage. My lord (saied the king of Denmarke) if you saw her apparrelled in the gowne the Princesse gaue her, I am assured you will scarse knowe her at the first. Will you that I send her word to bring it hether? It is well saied (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) with that he called a Squire, sending him to <HI>Carmelle,</HI> that as thē was in company of <HI>Arcabonnes</HI> Gentlewomen: but vnderstanding <HI>Esplandians</HI> pleasure, went presently to apparrell her selfe as hee had willed her, and hauing a mantle on her shoulders because she would not be séene, went to him in his chamber, where she found him and the king of Denmarke talking together: but as soon as he espied her, he tooke her in his armes, and setting her in a chair couered with veluet, saied vnto her: My goodfriend, I meane to shew my companion you sée here, how much I loue and estéeme him, wherefore I pray you shew me before him what intertaine∣ment the princesse <HI>Leonorine</HI> gaue you, knowing you came from
<PB REF="59"/> me, and whether I find any fauour in her sight. My lord (said she) as soone as I was arriued, and that she vnderstood the cause of my comming vnto her, I found her no lesse yours then you hers: whereby I may estéeme you the happiest knight liuing in the world. And know you why? She is so faire, and of so comely per∣sonage, that vnlesse it bee her selfe none can resemble her, and of truth shee dooth farre surpasse all other ladies, for being alone in her priuate chamber playing on some instrument, or singing for her pleasure, she stealeth and rauisheth the harts (seperated from the bodies of such) as either heare or sée her: and if at sometimes she attireth her selfe after the Italian manner, with a cap of that country fashion, then you may sée her faire and glistering haire part giuing a certaine shadow on her vermilion chéekes, the rest knit vp together, inuironing her head, shewing with farre better grace then any crowne that she could weare, bée it of stones, lau∣rell, or the finest gold that may be found. But if that be a tempta∣tion vnto man, her two humble and modest eies (like two suns) giue them as many deaths, as they at times behold the same, and againe reuiueth them better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen at the first, and all at one in∣stant: whereat you must not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abashed, séeing that loue it selfe doth often skirmish and striue in them, thereby to yéeld both pain and pleasure vnto those that doe behold the same: and if hée touch her, he feareth to hurt her, as being in most extreame passions of loue. And not without a cause, for that nature hauing made her, brake the mould, that shee might be the only perfect creature, ac∣companied with so many vertues, that loue findeth nothing in her but bones to gnaw vpon. And I assure you my lord, y<SUP>t</SUP> spea∣king vnto her of those thinges you had giuen mee in charge, I plainely perceiued her by the changing of her countenance to be charged with the like disease whereof you still complaine: for sometimes she blushed, and againe became pale, and otherwh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les was at such an exegent, that shee could not answere mee a ready woord: especially when I presented her with the ring that shee once gaue to <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>di</HI> your father, as she told mee afterwards: In recompence whereof shee sendeth you this hairelace, which shee most earnestly desireth you to kéepe for the loue of her, and as the
<PB REF="60"/> first Iewell her Grandfather <HI>Grimanaise</HI> gaue to the Emperesse <HI>Appolidon,</HI> being but her louer. Expressely sending you the same as an assured token of the loue she beareth vnto you, and the good will shee will bee ready alwaies to shew you during her mortall life. With that shee tooke a little boxe out of her bosome wrapped in a péece of Taffata, and gaue it vnto him, which <HI>Esplandian</HI> re∣ceiued, and taking it out of the boxe, he sighed tenderly and saied: Ha most fortunate present, (the first witnesse of the perfect alli∣ance that the most loiall louers that euer liued had together, from whom is descended the Paragon of all beauty) happy to haue ap∣proched so néere her person: But I much happier that receiueth it, as more affectioned to serue her then any other liuing on the earth: and it pleaseth God, while life indureth, I trust thou ne∣uer shalt depart from mee, but I will kéepe thée as carefully, as I desire she should hold my heart. Yet this is not all (said <HI>Carmelle</HI>) but behold the recompence of my labour, and saying so, shee cast the mantle from her shoulders, shewing them her rich gowne all couered with crownes of gold, which put <HI>Esplandian</HI> in minde of that <HI>Vrganda</HI> sent him word by her Gentlewoman, when shee sent him the white armour set with the like deuise, confirming in his mind the hope that vntill then he had holden doubtfull: wher∣at he felt the greatest ease that possible he might. And as they be∣held the great and excellent workemanship, with the great and costly imbrodery of Pearles and precious stones wherewith it was all couered, <HI>Gandalin</HI> came and knocked at the dore, to shew thé that there were a great number of vessels discouered on the sea, and fearing them to bee some new supply of Turkes, was of aduise they should bee ready to receiue them. Wherevpon each man ranne to armes, causing more men to goe into their shippes for their better safetie: yet that alarme continued but a while, for that the Pennons and Banners of Constantinople were perceiued on their ships, by such as they sent out for to descry thē: some of them comming backe againe in great hast to shew them that <HI>Gastilles</HI> as general of the army for y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperour, was com∣ming to succour them: whereof the Turks hauing intelligence, presently brake vp their campe, being gone farre from the castle
<PB REF="60"/> before any of the vessels come neare the shoare: Neuerthelesse, those of the castle set vpon their reare ward, and in the chase slue so great a number, that had not night come on (considring the euil order they held) there had not escaped a man of all their campe. In the mean time <HI>Gastilles</HI> with his army came vnto the moun∣taine, where <HI>Esplandian,</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Denmarke, and diuers others stoode ready to receiue him: and after many courtesies and wel∣comes on all parts giuen, <HI>Gastilles</HI> asked them how they dealt with their enemies. As well as may be (saied <HI>Esplandian,</HI>) but wée could not by any meanes cause them to stay till your comming, but they are fled from hence as soone as they heard newes there∣of: Then hee tolde him of the larumes and issues by them made during the siege, as also of the taking of king <HI>Armato.</HI> That is good newes (said <HI>Gastilles</HI>) God bee praised therefore, if mine vn∣cle the Emperour had beene aduertised thereof before my depar∣ture from Constantinople, I had not found the meanes to come send to visite you, which would haue displeased mée much, neither would he haue ben at charge to furnish such a Nauie: but he was in doubt you were in great necessity, that at my putting to sea hée commanded me to make al the spéed I could, til he came in person with four hundred saile y<SUP>t</SUP> already are prepared if our forces should not be sufficient to sustaine the Turkish army: but for this yeare he shall be excused, if there happē no other aduenture. I pray you (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) come to land, &amp; go with vs into the castle, where wee will conferre of all things with some better leisure: Which he agréed vnto, wherewith he &amp; some of the principall captaines of his army, entered into the knights boat, and with them went vp into the castle: where being arriued, <HI>Gastilles</HI> that knew king <HI>Armato</HI>) desired <HI>Esplandian</HI> before hee did any thing else, that hee might sée him, wherwith hée brought him to the chamber, where he sate as pensiue as any man could bee, <HI>Gastiles</HI> did him honour, as to his estate appertained. But king <HI>Armato</HI> would hardly looke vpon him, but saied vnto him: <HI>Gastilles,</HI> I maruaile much why the Emperour your maister (contrary to his faith and promise) hath broken the peace agréed vpon betwéene vs, and for a thing so little importing him as this place doth, where∣vnto
<PB REF="61"/> hee neuer had any right, as you well knowe. But I perceiue from whence the same procéedeth: because hee would e∣uery man should knowe the little faith and lesse loialty that is in him, which I shall one day make him know full well, if euer I escape out of this prison. My lord (said <HI>Gastilles,</HI> your honour sa∣ued) the Emperour my maister hath in him all the parts that be∣long vnto a wise, vertuous, and hardy Prince, such as hee is, and it séemeth vnto mee (vnder your correction) that by good and iust cause he hath done no more then he might do: séeing it is euident that this castle hath ben conquered by Christian knights, whom he is bound to fauour with all the aid hee can, not onely to defend our law, or because they haue desired his aide, as being the first and greatest monarch in the world, but to sustaine the right that both hee and his predecessors haue alwaies pretended to these marches. And where you threaten to make him féele the small loialty whereof you accuse him, at other times heretofore you haue met each other with your forces, where you sped so hardly, that I rather beléeue you speake in choler then with reason, spe∣cially considering the estate wherein you are at this present. <HI>Ga∣stilles</HI> (saied <HI>Armato,</HI>) Although I were dead, I haue sufficient number of Captaines and good Souldiours in my country to re∣uenge my cause, and a sonne likewise, that is not borne to indure the iniury done vnto his father: and thus much I assure thée, that if I thought him to bee other, I would slay him with mine owne hands as soone as I should sée him. My lord (saied <HI>Espl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndian</HI>) that Prince, Knight, or Gentleman that vseth such vnfit spéech as you doe now, is commonly holden for a man of no capacity, espe∣cially when hee is in a place where humility rather then threat∣nings would become him better: Haue you already forgotten the prison wherein you are, and in the handes of those that haue so small occasion to wish you well? My lord, vertue is neuer better knowne to bee in man, but then when hee is in most distresse: Wherefore if vntill this time you haue not knowne what con∣stancy doth meane, learne hereafter to discerne the same, vsing words worthy your estate, and not such nor so iniurious as you haue vttered vnto my lord <HI>Gastilles,</HI> who in this place represen∣teth
<PB REF="61"/> the person of an emperor, (a greater lord then you) in whose mercy your life or death consisteth: for we are all his souldiours, ready to doe him seruice. The king perceiuing well that hee had done them wrong, and fearing to bee hardlier vsed then hee was accustomed to bee, saied vnto <HI>Esplandian,</HI> Sir Knight, I pray you pardon my impatience, considring with your selfe the great gréef and melancholy humour wherein I am, when I (that was wont to be feared and redoubted of al the princes in Asia) am now con∣strained to obay the will and pleasure of my greatest enemies, which vnto me is so extreame gréefe, that I die each day a hun∣dred times, because I cannot die. But <HI>Esplandian</HI> answered not one word, but leauing him with his gard, taking <HI>Gastilles</HI> by the hand, led him into one of his best chambers, where they supped. The next day they assembled all together, and after many mat∣ters propounded, it was agréed among them, (according to <HI>Fran∣dalos</HI> aduise) that they should enter into Turkie, being as then in great perplexity, as well for the taking of king <HI>Armato,</HI> as for the ouerthrow of his army, as it shall bee shewed vnto you here∣after, for at this time wee will cease to speake thereof: returning to shew you of king <HI>Luisart,</HI> that during this time, for the most part held his court in the citty of London.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Ou haue heard before of the combat betwéene <HI>Esplandian</HI> and <HI>Amadis</HI> his father, and how af∣ter long time of their abode at Mirefleur, staying the healing of their wounds, <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> desiring to returne vnto the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> tooke his leaue of king <HI>Lu∣isart,</HI> the like did diuers of the knights, that as then were at the Court: as <HI>Galaor</HI> king of Sobradise, <HI>Agraies,
<PB REF="62"/> Gransador, Balan, Galuanes,</HI> and <HI>Angriotte d'estrauaulx,</HI> some to sée their wiues, others to tast the ease and pleasant rest of their man∣sion houses: whereby it happened the court was lesse replenished with knights then it had beene in long time before, especially by reason of the newes they heard from the castle <HI>La montaigne de∣fendu,</HI> whether diuers yong knights trauailed to aide <HI>Esplandian.</HI> King <HI>Luisart</HI> therefore so meanely accompanied as I said before, being very old and decrepit, began to bée melancholy and to haue the palsie, setting aside all Hunting, Hawking, Armes, and Chi∣ualry, or any other pleasure whatsoeuer: And with a remēbrance of death, so much abhorred all things past, present and to come, that he estéemed them vaine and altogether transitory: whereby he determined to depose himselfe of all kingly estate and gouern∣ment of his realme, to passe the rest of his time in a solitary and religious manner, specially when he called to mind the great pe∣rils from whence he had escaped, and aboue all his last most dan∣gerous and cruell imprisonment. Neuerthelesse, for a time hee kept it secret, vntill one night hee being a bed with the Quéene, where they lay talking of the sicklenesse of this world, hee disco∣uered his whole mind vnto her, and how hée determined to make <HI>Amadis</HI> his sonne king and gouernour of his country: to the end he might fréely and without any interruption withdraw himself to his castle of Mirefleur, where (by Gods helpe) he meant to liue a solitary life. The Quéene that was one of the wisest and de∣uoutest ladies in her time, confirmed him so well in his opinion, that they agréed to returne to London, there to accomplish their pretence. And the next day they departed from Mirefleur, accom∣panied of <HI>Amadis, Gransador,</HI> and others, and comming to Lon∣don, after they had remained there a certaine time, the Quéene sent for all the nobilitie: who being arriued at the court, caused a scaffold to bee made in the principall place of all the citty where the people might repaire. And as he and the Quéene both appar∣relled in their roiall robes, each set in a chaire of estate, <HI>Amadis</HI> sitting somwhat lower on his right hand, and <HI>Oriane</HI> on the left, were come thether a Herauld crying thrice, that all the people should kéepe silence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the king with a stately countenaunce and
<PB REF="62"/> Princely magnanimitie turning to the people, saied vnto them. My good friends and loial subiects, before I begin to shew you the cause why I haue made you to repaire vnto this place, I wil put you in mind of part of the dangers and great hazards wherein I haue often fallen since the death of my brother of famous memo∣ry king <HI>Falangris,</HI> whē it pleased God to call me vnto the gouern∣ment of this land, and as I thinke there are yet many of you li∣uing that can wel remember the danger wherein both I and my country thought to fall, when by the meanes and subtletie of <HI>Ar∣calaus</HI> the inchanter, I was deliuered into their hands that long time before had conspired my death, from whence my sonne <HI>A∣madis</HI> deliuered mee: Yet not long after by euill counsell, I made warre against him, which ended as all men know, fortune enui∣ous of my felicitie, afterward prepared mee such a banket, that without his helpe I had beene prisoner with king <HI>Arauigne,</HI> and vtterly ouerthrowne. And that which hath yet more astonished mee was, that when I thought my selfe sure and out of danger of all mishaps, a worse then all the former suddainely chanced vnto me, the which (considering the place wherein I was) I thought verely to haue ben the end and consumation of my daies. Neuer∣thelesse the Lord God regarding me in pitty, sent my yong sonne <HI>Esplandian</HI> to my sorrowfull prison, from whence hée hath deliue∣red mee, as no doubt you haue heard. Now my good subiects you all sée mée to bee very old and white haired, hauing already attai∣ned to the thréescore and tenth yeare of mine age, which maketh me think it time now to forget all wordly pleasures, and to serue God to whom I am so much bound: And for this cause I haue de∣termined from henceforth to forsake all royall dignity, and leaue you my son <HI>Amadis</HI> for your king, to whome at this time I yéeld both my Crowne, Scepter, and all the right I haue vnto the go∣uernement of this land: praying you all as much as possibly I may, that hereafter you will bee faithfull and true subiects vnto him, as you haue alwaies ben to me. And although hée bée but my sonne in law, if I knew him vnworthy of the place, beléeue mee my good friendes, I would sooner chuse a méere stranger for my successor, then I would doe him: but there is not one among you
<PB REF="63"/> but knoweth well his great deserts, and of what race hee com∣meth: that at this day may well bee called one of the most noble and happiest linages in all the word, as being descended from the valiant Troyans, whereof the memory shall indure for euer. He is a kings sonne, heire vnto the crowne of France, &amp; now your Prince and Gouernour, and so I leaue him vnto you, with my daughter your Quéene and lawfull Princesse: holding to my selfe only the castle of Mirefleur, where (with Gods helpe) the Quéene and I will end our daies religiously, seruing God, as we are bound to doe. Then calling <HI>Amadis,</HI> giuing him his royall mantle, he willed him presently to put it on, the like did the quéen to <HI>Oriane.</HI> Mean time the silence was so great, that nothing could bée heard among the people but cries and lamentations, mooued with pitty &amp; compassion to sée the determination of their Prince: who being apparrelled in a simple robe of blacke cloth, tooke his sonne and the Quéene his daughter, set them in their regal seats, and in presence of all the people, set each of them a crown of gold vpon their heads, causing them to be proclaimed by the Heralds, King and Quéene of great Brittaigne: That done, euery man departed, some wéeping, and others glad, for the aduancement they hoped from the new king, who from thenceforth began so wisely to gouerne his country, that neuer was any prince better beloued nor obaied of his subiects. King <HI>Luisart</HI> within short time after (accompanied of the Quéen and <HI>Grumedan</HI>) went vnto Mi∣refleur as hee had determined to doe, where they liued so austere∣ly, helping and being present at euery houre when seruice was to be saied as readily as the poorest of the old men that remained there, for the administration and seruice to the religious women in the monaster of the deuout Abbesse Adalasta. But when king <HI>Amadis</HI> perceiued his meanes to recompence those of whome in his yoong yeares hee had receiued great pleasure and seruice, hee began to exalt <HI>Arban de Norgales,</HI> giuing him one of the fairest Islands in his country, to <HI>Gandales</HI> the lands of the duke of Bri∣stow, to <HI>Gandalin</HI> (as then absent) hee gaue the lands of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>calaus</HI> the inchanter, he made <HI>Angriotte destrauaulx</HI> great maister of his horse, <HI>Guilan le pensife</HI> high steward of his house, <HI>Ardan le nain</HI>
<PB REF="63"/> his chéefe caruer, and married the Gentlewoman of Denmarke very richly. Not long after the Quéene was brought to bed of a goodly sonne and a faire daughter both at one birth, the sonne na∣med <HI>Perion,</HI> and the daughter <HI>Brisenne:</HI> At whose natiuitie great ioy was made throughout all the country, especially at London, where the same day one of <HI>Norandels</HI> Squires arriued, that told king <HI>Amadis</HI> howe <HI>Esplandian</HI> and his maister met together in Almaigne, where the day before hee had slaine two Giants, and deliuered <HI>Gandalin</HI> with diuers other knights, Squires, Ladies, and Gentlewomen out of prison. Knowest thou (saied the King) what way they tooke afterward? My lord (saied the Squire) they made account io goe vnto the castle called <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> to helpe them that are therein, beeing in great necessitie: Which the king vnderstanding, sent presently for all the Pilotes that might bee found, and in all hast caused to rig and arme the grea∣test ship he had to saile into the East to his sonne, who in y<SUP>e</SUP> mean time (mooued therevnto by <HI>Frandalo</HI>) departed from the castle of <HI>Matroco</HI> with the Emperours army to inuade the Turks coun∣try, as in the next chapter you shall heare.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. How the towne of Alfarin in Turkie being assaulted, was taken by Esplandian and the rest of his company.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Ot long after the siege of <HI>La montaigne defendu</HI> was raised, and <HI>Gastilles</HI> arri∣ued at the castle as you heard before: <HI>Frandalo</HI> had aduise by <HI>Belleris</HI> his ne∣phewe, (that returned out of Turkie, where hee had been to sée what newes in the countrey) that <HI>Alforax</HI> sonne to king <HI>Armato,</HI> and gouernor of y<SUP>e</SUP> great Cittie of Tasifant, vnderstanding the imprisonment of his father, with the ouerthrow of the Turkish armie, was departed from the towne of Alfarin: where hee had
<PB REF="64"/> left the beautifull Princesse <HI>Heliaxa</HI> his wife, doughter to <HI>Am∣phirion</HI> king of Medea, to go with all dilligence to set order in his owne gouernement, and raise more men, thereby to resist the Christians power if they entred further into y<SUP>e</SUP> countrey. Which vnderstood by <HI>Esplandian, Gastilles, Ambor, Manely,</HI> and the king of Denmarke, they determined to enter into Turkie, wherevn∣to by many reasons <HI>Frandalo</HI> persuaded them, shewing them what meanes they had to besiege the town of Alfarin, not aboue two daies iourney from them, being hardly prouided of victuals, and no Garrison therein: Wherfore it was agréed among them, that <HI>Gastilles</HI> with his Nauie of ships should depart the next eue∣ning in as secret manner as hee could, to sée if he might surprise their Hauen, and that they on the other side would trauaile all night, whereby they might besiege the Towne both by land and sea, entring therein before the Turkes should hear news there∣of. And as they agréed, they put the same in execution: in such ma∣ner that <HI>Gastilles</HI> (giuing forth that he would returne againe vn∣to Constantinople) about sunne setting tooke ship, when hee put to sea, the moone shone bright, wherfore hoising vp their ankers, they set saile: And they had not sailed long, but he called his chéef Captaines together, discouering his enterprise vnto thē, where∣with presently leauing the way to Constantinople, they made towards the towne of Alfarin. On the other side, <HI>Frandalo</HI> slept not, when he perceiued his time, (all the company being alreadie aduertised that he meant to goe by night) they issued out of the castle, euery man carrying victuals with him for the space of four daies: And they trauailed so long, that about the breake of day they came vnto a great forrest, where they staied in ambushmēt till the nert night following, when they issued forth, and about thrée of the clocke at night they came vnto a path that went two waies, where <HI>Frandalo</HI> caused them to stay, and calling <HI>Esplandi∣an,</HI> said vnto him: My lord, I pray you let vs two and no more take the way that leadeth on the left hand, and <HI>Belleris</HI> my ne∣phew shall guide the rest of our company to the mountaigne of Yarebreh, from whence they may easily sée if our Nauy be néere the citty of Alfarin: and then as they finde the enterprise goe for∣ward,
<PB REF="64"/> they may assaile the place, or else remaine in ambush til oc∣casion serueth. You and I wil follow on this way, that wil bring vs to y<SUP>e</SUP> aduenturous fountaine, by the which lieth the great way that leadeth to Tesifant, where most commonly are found di∣uers strange aduentures, and if by fortune wee might méete the Princesse <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> that as to morrow should depart from Alfa∣rin to goe vnto her husband, we shall not loose our labours. Let vs goe (said <HI>Esplandian:</HI>) with that <HI>Belleris</HI> and his company went their way, and <HI>Frandalo, Esplandian, Sergil,</HI> with the Gentle∣woman of Denmarke tooke the other way, who about y<SUP>e</SUP> breake of day arriued at the aduenturous fountaine, where there stoode foure great copper pillers all gilded, and at each piller hong a ta∣ble with certaine writings therein, the contents whereof when time serueth you shall heare declared, as also the occasion why they were set vp. Being arriued there, not farre off they percea∣ued a light that issued out of a Taffata pauillion that stoode vpon the side of the fountaine, wherevnto they approched as couertlie as they could, where they perceiued a most beautiful Gentlewo∣man combing of her haire, and not farre from thence twenty knights all armed kéeping watch about her, among the which was a squire holding a horse all trapped with cloth of gold. But <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Esplandian</HI> were no sooner arriued, but they were discouered, yet they fearing a greater ambush, the most part of them losing courage, began to flie away: which the two knights perceiuing, entred among them, and at their first comming ouer∣threw foure or fiue of them vnto the ground, forcing them that were behind to returne againe, wherewith there began a fierce and cruell battaile, for those that first began to runne away (loo∣king backe and perceiuing only two knights that set vpon their fellowes) were so ashamed, that they turned again to help them: neuerthelesse without the force of thrée Giants that held against the knights, they could not haue indured so long against <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> and <HI>Frandalo,</HI> but they thrée fought so valiantly with them, that the two knights were in the greatest danger then euer they were before. And as you sée a Boare foming at the mouth (follo∣wed of a troope of dogs) set his taile against a trée, and with his
<PB REF="65"/> tuskes teare and rent the flesh of the boldest dogs that doe assaile him, so were <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Esplandian</HI> among the knights they had assailed, striking both on the right hand and the left with so great fury, that at one instant two of their principall enemies were slaine, so that there remained but one Giant to fight with them, with whom <HI>Frandalo</HI> made his party good, while <HI>Esplandi∣an</HI> followed the rest, that as then began to flie. But when the Gi∣ant perceiued <HI>Esplandian</HI> returne, being in feare of death, he step∣ped aside and said vnto <HI>Frandalo,</HI> Sir Knight, you and I haue of∣ten beene companions in many haulty enterprises, I pray you therefore shew mée the fauour to receiue mee vnto mercy, other∣wise you might bée blamed of those that know vs both, for I am your cousin <HI>Foron.</HI> Whereat <HI>Frandalo</HI> was much abashed, &amp; could hardly bee persuaded therevnto, wherefore hee praied him to put off his helmet, and if it be true (said he) that thou art <HI>Foron,</HI> I wil vse thée both like a friend and kinsman. Wherewith the Giant disarmed his head, whereby <HI>Frandalo</HI> knewe him and imbraced him, whereat <HI>Esplandian</HI> was much abashed, not knowing what had passed betwéene them, with that hee went néerer vnto them, asking vpon what cause that salutation procéeded. Then <HI>Franda∣lo</HI> tolde what the Giant was, desiring him likewise to take pittie on him: which <HI>Esplandian</HI> agréed vnto, then they thrée together went vnto the pauillion, at the entry wherof they found the gen∣tlewoman talking with <HI>Carmelle,</HI> no more abashed at the ouer∣throw of her men, then if shee had séene them iustle for their plea∣sures. She was apparrelled in a gowne of Damaske all imbro∣dered and set wih Pearles and precious stones, <HI>Frandalo</HI> present∣ly knew her, as hauing séene her oftentimes, especially the same day shee was married to <HI>Alphorax</HI> where hee iusteled and did so valiantly, that she intertained him for her knight, wherfore ligh∣ting on foote, and pulling off his helmet, hee saluted her in most humble manner. Wherewith shee being abashed to sée him that she estéemed wholly to be hers, so to haue behaued himself against her guard, said vnto him: How now <HI>Frandalo,</HI> is this the seruice I looked for at your hands, hauing receiued you for my knight? The diuell take such seruants, séeing you are so fainthearted vn∣to
<PB REF="65"/> her, that hetherto hath reputed you one of the most courteous knights that euer was girl with sword: but now I find I am de∣ceiued, for I should rather haue suspected any other then you to be a doer in this enterprise, whereby I cannot but bee much aba∣shed. Madame (said <HI>Frandalo</HI>) since y<SUP>e</SUP> time I became your knight, at the last tourney that I ranne, a lord of greater power hath in∣tertained me into his seruice, whom I wil serue during my mor∣tall life, séeing it hath pleased him to shew me so great fauour, be∣ing wel assured, that when you know him as I do, you wil estéem me happy, how cowardly or villainous soeuer you account mee now. What is he (said she) tel me of your faith? it is Iesus Christ (said <HI>Frandalo:</HI>) yet wil I neuer faile to do you all the honour and seruice that I can, as also now at this time, so my companion bée content, for without him I cannot doe it. <HI>Frandalo</HI> (said <HI>Esplandi∣an</HI>) you may command mee, for I am ready to doe what pleaseth you: Wherefore delay not to do all the pleasure &amp; seruice you can vnto this lady if it be your will. Wherewith <HI>Frandalo</HI> thanked him most hartely, and saied to <HI>Heliaxe:</HI> Madame, séeing hee will haue it so, I pray you from henceforth put all your trust in mee, and I will not faile to be carefull for you: Mean time I pray you get vpon your palfrey, that I may bring you to a place where you may sée farre better tourneyes then any at your wedding: af∣terward (if it pleaseth God to fauour vs) you shall easily perceiue how much I estéeme and haue in remembrance the fauours you haue heretofore shewed vnto mee, being but a simple knight, and you a great Princes to command farre better then my selfe: for neuer was Princesse more honoured and estéemed among her owne subiects then you shall bee of them, to whome I meane to bring you, which may bee an example vnto kings and mightie Princes, to whome God hath giuen power and authoritie, who being aduertised of the honourable and good intertainment made to you by vs, they may be moued hereafter to take pleasure in in∣tertaining the meaner as wel as the greater, considring the mu∣tabilitie of fortune, as by your selfe it well appeareth. <HI>Frandalo</HI> (saied she) you may make as many excuses and faire promises as you list, yet can you not deny but you haue done mee wrong, yet
<PB REF="66"/> in doing as you saie you will, your reputation will bee better to the world, although your faith hath failed to our gods: wherefore let vs goe where it pleaseth you. With that she got vpon her pal∣frey, and <HI>Frandalo</HI> bareheaded leading her horse, till they came néere vnto the towne, where they heard a great noise, that made the two knights thinke, either their enterprise to be discouered, or that their Souldiours assailed the Towne. And fearing they had ben repulsed, began to repent themselues of their long stay∣ing with the Princesse, to whom <HI>Frandalo</HI> in most courteous ma∣ner saied: Madame, Is it not your pleasure (meane time that I and my companion goe vnto the towne) to stay here for vs with this Gentlewoman and my cousin <HI>Foron?</HI> I truly (said <HI>Heliaxa</HI>) and I will not depart from hence before I heare of you againe. With that <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Esplandian</HI> ranne in great hast towards the Towne, where they found their companions fighting with those of Alfarin, among the which were <HI>Talanque, Ambor,</HI> the king of Denmarke, <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Lazinde,</HI> that had giuen the town a hard skirmish on that side, thinking to giue them so much to doe, that in the meane time the army by sea might assaile the water gate: but they were too soone discouered, whereby they found great resistance on all sides: Neuerthelesse <HI>Norandel</HI> and <HI>Belleris</HI> had gotten the Barriers, and repulsed the enemies vnto the pallisadoes. Which <HI>Esplandian</HI> and <HI>Frandalo</HI> perceiuing, they lighted on foot, and being couered with their shields, their swords in their hands, passed through the prease, and with bold courage, went so farre, that they slewe great number of the enemies: for the Alfarins to defend their citty issued out of the gates, and the Christians to winne it, did most valiantly, but the place was so narrow, they could not hurt their enemies so much as in the opē field. Whereby it happened, that <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Esplandian</HI> min∣ding either to winne or loose, stepped so farre forward, that the Alfarins flying into the towne, and they after, found themselues alone within the same among their enemies, and that so farre, that had it not ben for <HI>Frandalo, Esplandian</HI> (that tooke no care but only to kill and ouerthrow the enemy) had ben inclosed by them, but hee pulled him backe. Whereby the two knights perceaued
<PB REF="66"/> the danger they were in, wherefore by little and little they got vnto the steps, that went vpon the wall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where they sustained many hard assalts without being hurt, although the enemy cea∣sed not to throw Launces, Stones, Darts, and all other wea∣pons at them they could find, none of thē daring come to handle strokes, for if any aduanced himselfe to shew his Prowes, it cost him his life, or els was throwne downe headlong. Meane time <HI>Norandel</HI> and his company, that had séene <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Esplandi∣an</HI> shut into the towne, sought by all meanes to scale the wals, or else to breake the gates: but all in vaine, for they within defended it so well with Oile, scalding Water, Logs and Stones, that di∣uers of them were ouerthrowne, and ended their liues most mi∣serably. And fighting in that sort, a knight all armed came from the Hauen, crying with a loud voice and said: Be of good courage my children, be of good courage, defend this quarter well, for our enemies on the sea side haue not as yet found meanes to set one man on land, and yet haue lost aboue two hundred of their men. By God (saied one of them) I sée not one that standeth idle, yet can we not ouercome these two knights. Why so (said the other?) They are (saied he) entered in among vs, and wee haue ben these two howers fighting with them, but all in vaine, for the yoongest of them fighteth so valiantly, that wee dare not approch them: And which is more, hee and his companion in despight of vs all haue gotten those staires, where they now defend themselues, and that so well that we can find no means to driue them thence, although many of our men haue been slain by them, &amp; others cru∣elly wounded. I am of opinion (said the knight) that wee receiue thē vnto mercy, for it may bee they are such men, that for to haue them againe, the enemy will bée glad to giue king <HI>Armato</HI> in ex∣change, and returne againe into their country. Wherevnto they all agéed, and therewith the knight that had giuen them that counsell, made signes vnto <HI>Esplandian</HI> that they would parley with them, whereby the assault ceased for a time, and the knight spake vnto them in this manner, Sir knights, you sée it is impos∣sible for you to escape from hence, and it were great pitty that two so valiant knights should die so yoong now in the flower of
<PB REF="67"/> your ages. But this wee will doe, yéeld your selues, and wee will saue your liues. Sir knight (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) If wee die at this time, we are quit for euer after, but so much there wanteth ther∣of, and wee haue so good hearts and so sure a confidence in Iesus Christ, in whose quarrell we fight, that wee hope he will giue vs meanes not only to escape this danger, but to spoile the Towne and lead you prisoners with vs: Wherefore take this counsell for your selues, and yéelde you vnto vs before the wrath of God bée further moued against you. When they that stood about them heard those wordes, both great and small began to crie with a lowd voice, saying: Stay that villaine, let him die, or wee will die here at his féet: wherewith they assailed them so fiercely, that they were constrained to get vpō the highest steps. But not long after they repulsed the enemy so valiantly with stones (whereof they found great quantity vpon the Portall) that from that time forwards they had no longer stomacks to assaile them. But <HI>No∣randel</HI> and the rest being without, vnderstanding the noise and the voice of their companions, whome they estéemed dead or ta∣ken prisoners, determined to set fire on the gates, while the rest assailed the towne: Wherewith euery man ranne to fetch wood, which the Alfarins perceiued, but to conclude, they could not shun it, but whether they would or not, the draw-bridge and the gates were set on fire: wherewith they were so abashed, that most part of them began to flie vnto the great temple of Iupiter, the principall place of strength within their citty, the rest stay∣ing behind, with full determination rather to die then suffer the Christians to enter the Towne. And séeing the gates burnt downe, so many of them ranne to fetch water, that not long af∣ter the Christians had meanes to assaile the towne on that side, which assault continued so long that day failed, yet could they not enter by reason of the great resistance the Alfarins made, but the two knights that were aboue did them so much hurt with blockes and stones, that not any of them durst appeare, where∣by the Christians became maisters of the towne. Wherin great number of people, both men, women, and children, were put to the sword, and more had died had it not ben night, specially on the
<PB REF="67"/> water side where <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stilles</HI> and his army entred with most great fury. Neuerthelesse fearing least the Alfarins should assemble a∣gaine, and in the night they might bee repulsed, hee commanded a retraict to bee founded, being well assured the next day to haue the towne at their pleasure. And for the same cause he sent to the army on land that they should do the like: wherewith euery man retired, setting watch in those places where most néed required. The towne in this sort being conquered, and the people gotten into the great temple of Iupiter, <HI>Esplandian</HI> minding not to lose the Princesse <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> nor the Giant <HI>Foron,</HI> that he and <HI>Frandalo</HI> left with <HI>Carmelle,</HI> desired <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Lazinde</HI> to goe fetch them, and with them hee sent <HI>Sergil</HI> his Squire to bring them to the place: which they presently did, and made such hast, that they found her sitting by a great fire that <HI>Foron</HI> had made, where ligh∣ting off their horses &amp; saluting <HI>Heliaxe, Gandalin</HI> said: Madame, my lord <HI>Esplandian</HI> praieth you to come vnto the place where hee staieth for you. My friends (saied shee) I knew him not, true it is I was brought hether by two knights, whereof one is <HI>Frandalo,</HI> that I haue knowne long time, but for the other I assure you as farre as I remember I neuer sawe him before. Madame (saied <HI>Carmelle</HI>) hee is sonne to the valiant knight <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> whose fame is spread so farre about the world. Truly (saied <HI>Heli∣axa</HI>) I haue heard of him, so haue you (as I thinke said <HI>Carmelle</HI>) of my lord <HI>Esplandian</HI> his sonne: for hee alone conquered the ca∣stle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> and now lately hath taken king <HI>Ar∣mato</HI> your father in lawe, and I can assure you hee is one of the courteous knights liuing in the world. I am much abashed then (saied she) how he shewed himselfe so vncourteous in my behalf, not speaking vnto me while I was in his company, yet me thin∣keth being his prisoner, hee could haue done no lesse then com∣fort mée, either with good spéeches or faire promises, whereof hee hath vsed so few, that while I liue I shall neuer thinke well of him. Madame (saied <HI>Carmelle</HI>) you take the matter otherwise then it is, for if hee refrained to speake vnto you, it was by rea∣son of the great acquaintance hee perceiued <HI>Frandalo</HI> to haue with you, vnto whome he is so great a friend, that hee was not
<PB REF="68"/> onely content to giue him leaue to entertaine you, but much greater fauour would hee doe vnto him if hee can. You may say what you will (saied shee:) Neuerthelesse, if he haue no other ex∣cuse then that you alledge in his behalfe, hee shall neuer lose the disliking hee hath gotten at my hands. Madame (saied <HI>Gandalin</HI>) I am well assured hee will amend that fault when it pleaseth you, wherefore I pray you determine what you meane to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, for hee hath commaunded vs to doe as pleaseth you: My friendes (saied <HI>Heliaxe</HI>) I would gladly sléepe till it bee day, then I will bee ready to goe where you thinke good, but I pray you tell mee what noise it was I heard of late within the Towne. Madame (saied <HI>Lazinde</HI>) It is not yet thrée howers since the Towne was taken by assault. Good God (saied she) what miserable fortune was that for the poore inhabitants, I thinke they are all put vn∣to the sword. No madame (saied <HI>Lazinde</HI>) the greater part haue saued themselues in the great Temple of Iupiter, but they will hardly escape when it is day, for our Generals are deter∣mined to burne the Temple. If it bee so (saied shee) that <HI>Fran∣dalo</HI> hath any credite with his companions, and that hee that sent you bee so courteous as this Gentlewoman reporteth him to bee, I hope they will take pittie on the poore people: at least, if not for the loue of them, I trust vpon request for my sake they will not refuse it. And to the end I come not thether for late, I pray you when day appeareth, let vs presentlie de∣part, wherewith laying her downe vpon a cloke, shee passed the rest of the night, not greatly to her ease.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. How Gandalin and Lazinde brought the Princesse Heliaxe and the Giant Foron into the Towne of Alfarin to Esplandian and Frandalo, and of the honourable intertainment they had.</HEAD>
<PB REF="68"/>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Eliaxe</HI> that had not slept all that night, being gréeued for the losse of the towne of Alfarin, the ordinary abiding place of <HI>Alphorax</HI> her husband, and withall the pleasantest and most delicious place of all Turkie, perceauing day to appeare, waked the two knights, making her account if shee might get into the towne before the destruction of the temple, the people that were fled into it, (by her request and humble supplication to <HI>Esplandian</HI> and <HI>Frandalo</HI>) should bee saued. With that they all mounted on their horses, and made such hast, that they entred into the town, as the Christians began to assault the fortresse, and when <HI>Frandalo</HI> per∣ceiued the Princesse <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> hee rode vnto her, bidding her God morrow, and taking her palfry by the bridle bareheaded, brought her to <HI>Esplandian</HI> and his company that did her great honor, kno∣wing her to be a kings doughter, and wife to so great a Prince. With that shee asked <HI>Frandalo</HI> which of them was <HI>Esplandian,</HI> Madame (saied hee, pointing vnto him) here he is ready to do you any seruice that he can, as hee hath assured mee. But when shee perceiued him to bee so yoong and of so great beautie, shee was a∣bashed to think how nature had furnished him with so many good perfections, especially of so great and incomparable force, wher∣of he had the commendation among the most valerous knights: wherewith shee saied vnto <HI>Frandalo,</HI> In good faith I haue heard him commended in diuers places for one of the best knights li∣uing in the world, and of mine owne knowledge I haue séen him doe that which I would neuer haue thought to bee in him, consi∣dering his yoong yeares, so that if hee abound as much in courte∣sie as he doth in valour and beautie, I thinke him to bee the bra∣uest Gentleman that may bee found: which I shall presently sée if he graunt me one request. Madame (saied <HI>Esplandian,</HI> blushing at the praises she vsed in respect of him) If I doe it not, you shall be the first that euer I refused gift vnto in all my life: and consi∣dering your great beautie and most courteous behauiour, howe should it be possible for me to disobay your will? I pray you then sir knight (said she) to pardon the poore people that are within the
<PB REF="69"/> Temple, and graunt them vnto mee, with leaue to send them where I shall thinke good, not hurting them any more. In good truth madame (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) you shall not be refused for so smal a matter, and I will doe so much with the other knights, that they shall giue consent, as also to your owne libertie and the Gi∣ant <HI>Forons,</HI> to guide you where it pleaseth you, which <HI>Frandalo</HI> did most earnestly desire at our handes before you arriued here: And for his sake looke what else you will command at our hands, wee are ready to performe it with all our hearts. For the which the Princesse <HI>Heliaxe</HI> thanked him most heartely, and turning to <HI>Frandalo,</HI> saied vnto him: Sir Knight, the good that you and your companions doe vnto mee, shall neuer bee forgotten on my part, but I will by all means séeke to acknowledge the same, although presently I cannot doe it: wherefore if it pleaseth you, cause your souldiours to retire, that these poore distressed people may come forth according to your promise: In the meane time I will goe comfort them, for I am in doubt most part of them are rather dead then liuing: with that she desired <HI>Carmelle</HI> to bear her com∣pany, they two going to the Temple gate, which they found fast shut and rampired vp: then shée called so lowd, that some of them spake vnto her: but neuer did men by pardon from their Prince, brought backe againe from the Gibbet, more reioice, nor were better comforted then they when they knew her, thinking the prince <HI>Alphorax</HI> had made some agréement with their enemies. Wherefore they opened a little wicket, whereat shee and the Gentlewoman entered into the Temple, they asking the Prin∣cesse howe it was her chaunce to come thether in so good a time to succour them, that looked for no other fauour then most cruell death. My friends (saied she) I haue done so much with the Chri∣stians (by <HI>Frandalos</HI> meanes) whome I haue knowne long time, that they are content to let you issue foorth, your liues saued, and goe where it pleaseth you, and my selfe likewise that had fallen into their hands as well as you: wherefore chuse whether you will follow mee to Tesifant where my lord <HI>Alphorax</HI> is, who for my sake will shew you all the fauor and courtesie he may. When the poore people vnderstood the agréement made for them by the
<PB REF="69"/> Princesse <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> they all agréed to goe with her, and not for∣sake her, giuing her most hearty thankes for the good shee had wrought them. Then (saied <HI>Heliaxe</HI>) let those that haue armour put it off, and come all forth with mee. Then she being accompa∣nied in that manner, came vnto <HI>Esplandian,</HI> and shewing him great numbers of women and little children that stood about her, said vnto him: I pray you sir knight behold the good whereof you are the cause, and thinke what domage it had beene if these poore s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly soules had suffered death for no offence, wherein you are worthy great commendations. And yet (said shée, smiling) while I liue, I shall not forget the small account you made of me when <HI>Frandalo</HI> and you found mee before my pauillion, after the ouer∣throw of my knights. Wherefore madame (saied <HI>Esplandian?</HI>) I maruaile (saied shée) why you aske mee such a question, séeing you might well conceiue what gréefe I had in mind, yet did you not so much as once salute me, or vse word vnto mee: in good truth it was but discourteously done of you. Madame (saied hee) I beséech you pardon mee, for the fault I committed in your behalfe, was not done for want of bringing vp, but fearing to bréede some iea∣lousie in <HI>Frandalos</HI> mind, séeing him so much affected to doe you seruice, together with the good countenaunce you shewed vnto him, although you had lost your men. This excuse (said <HI>Heliaxe</HI>) is not to be accepted, neither shal you escape so easily therewith: which shee spake with so good a countenance, that her séeming to bee offended, contented all the company: wherefore <HI>Esplandian</HI> saied vnto her, Madame, I am content to make amends for this great fault, or to doe what pennance it pleaseth you. The pen∣nance (said she) that you shall haue shall be, that according to the promise of mercy you haue made vnto these poore people, as also of fauour in mine owne behalfe, you giue vs leaue to go vnto the citty of Tesifant to my husband, that for the same we thinke the better of you. Madame (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) you haue already vnder∣stood our minds, wherefore you may fréely go whether it pleaseth you, and I my self will be your guide if it be your pleasure. With that <HI>Heliaxe</HI> gaue them many thankes, and taking her leaue, got vpon her palfrey, and being accompanied of <HI>Foron</HI> with a
<PB REF="70"/> great number of the poore people, tooke the way that went to Tesifant, <HI>Frandalo</HI> going with her aboue a league and more, and further would haue gone although hee were wounded in diuers places of his body, but she desired him to go back againe. For (said she) although like a good &amp; curteous knight you haue had y<SUP>e</SUP> means not onely to serue mee, but also to saue the life of me and mine, it may bee I shall not haue so the like to doe the same for you if you fall into my lord <HI>Alphorax</HI> hands: who as I thinke ere now is aduertised of my misfortune, whereby I am in doubt hee is al∣ready in the field with great number of men to succour me. And if it should be so, I know him so impatient, that if hee méet with you (being already moued with the losse of Alfarin, as also the iniury my knights haue receiued, and my selfe likewise as hee will suppose) the pleasure that you doe me would bréed a danger to your person, and to me great gréefe, wherefore I pray you goe no further, but turne backe againe. <HI>Frandalo</HI> knew her counsell to be good, wherewith hee committed her to God: leauing her in the guard of his cousin <HI>Foron,</HI> and therewith returned the same way that hee came. It was then somewhat late, wherfore <HI>Heli∣axe</HI> hauing trauailed vnto the aduenturous fountain, and finding her pauillion as yet standing vp, determined not to depart from thence till the next day in the morning, that shee tooke the way that led to Tesifant. And hauing ridden till noone, shee met the Prince <HI>Alphorax,</HI> with a great number of knights that all night had staied vpon the way to the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> thin∣king those that had takē his wife would lead her thether, to haue her in safe kéeping, and such was their opinion that brought him newes thereof. But they met not any man in the way, wherfore they returned againe to go vnto the aduenturous fountain, much gréeued when they perceiued the Princesse <HI>Heliaxe</HI> comming to∣wards them, to whom <HI>Alphorax</HI> ranne, and imbrasing him with a louing kisse, asked her how she had escaped from the enemy. My lord (said she) when I shall haue told you how, yet am I in doubt you will hardly beléeue it. And to say the truth, it séemeth fortune hath taken pleasure in one day to make mee know both the good and euill shee could doe vnto mee. Then shee shewed him of the
<PB REF="70"/> ouerthrow of her knights, the words that passed betwéene <HI>Fran∣dalo, Esplandian,</HI> and her: and lastly the honest intertainement they vsed in her behalfe. Truly madame (saied <HI>Alphorax</HI>) it is ve∣ry strange, and I cannot imagine how these Christian dogs (ha∣uing taken my Towne of Alfarin by assault) haue vsed so much humanity, not only to these people, but haue saued your honour, being such and so beautifull a lady as you are. But it is to bee thought, that our gods hauing compassion on me, haue preserued you, as the thing I loue and most estéeme off in this world. Yet if I liue but one yeare longer, I sweare and promise vnto you to assemble so many men together, that the citty of Constantinople and her periured Emperour shal suffer and indure much woe: in such manner, that the memory thereof shal not be extinct for one thousand yeares after my decease. <HI>Heliaxe</HI> that perceiued him enter into choler, to pacefie the same, answered vim and said: My lord, you may doe it when it pleaseth you, but at this present you sée here a great number of poore desolate people, I beséech you speake vnto them and comfort them as wel as you may, for their whole trust is in you, with that <HI>Alphorax</HI> going vnto them, gaue them many gracious and comfortable spéeches, and with them returned to the citty of Tesifant.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI. How Gastilles tooke his leaue of Esplandian, and sailed to Constan∣tinople, and of the arriuall of Palomir, Branfil, and other knights of great Brittaigne at the towne of Alfarin.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Towne of Alfarin brought vnder the subiection of the knights of the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> as you heard before, <HI>Gastilles</HI> hauing prepared himselfe to re∣turn to Cōstantinople, went vnto <HI>Esplan∣dian,</HI> and saied vnto him: My lord, when I departed from the Emperour, hee gaue me expresse commandement with al spéed
<PB REF="71"/> to aduertise him what I had done, to the end he might determine either to come himselfe in person, if occasion serued, with the ar∣my hee is already preparing, or else wholly to breake off his en∣terprise, for it now beginneth to bee Winter, and séeing (as it is Gods will) that your affaires on this side are in good estate, I am determined as to morrow to depart hence to Constanti∣nople, that the Emperour vnderstanding by mee what hath pas∣sed on this side the sea, he shall not bee forced for this yeare to bee at further charges, wherof before this time I had willingly cer∣tefieed him, had it not ben the daily expectation I had to sée y<SUP>e</SUP> end of this our last enterprise, which God bee thanked is fallen out as we desired. My lord (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) séeing the Emperour (as you say) by your returne may receiue both, pleasure and profite, you shall doe well to make hast thether: one thing I beséech you doe for me, that is, most humbly to commend me vnto his grace, assuring him, that not any subiect hee hath, is or shall bee rea∣dier to obey him then my selfe: and as touching our procee∣dings, for that you haue personally both séene and béene an ac∣tor in the same, you can aduertise him at large. Shew him like∣wise I pray you that I kéepe king <HI>Armato</HI> as his prisoner, at∣tending his pleasure what shall bee done with him, but not the castle of <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> for I haue conquered the same in fauour and vnder the protection of the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> kée∣ping the same at this present onely to her vse and as her ser∣uant, as I meane to continue during my life. But if it plea∣seth his grace to giue the Towne of Alfarin to <HI>Frandalo,</HI> not onely thereby to increase his will and desire to serue him, but also for that hee deserueth a greater reward: so dooing, mee thinketh hee shall therein shewe the part of a liberall Prince, considering the seruice and fidelitie hee hath done and shewed in all places where hee hath beene employed: You shall tell the Emperour also, that according to my fa∣thers will and commandement, I hope shortly to bee in Con∣stantinople to present my selfe before his grace and the ladie <HI>Leonorine,</HI> as by the Gentlewoman <HI>Carmelle</HI> I haue giuen thē to vnderstand, wherewith I think you are not vnacquainted,
<PB REF="71"/> praying you in the meane time, to make my excuse to them, in that I haue deferred it off so long; for in a manner, you are not ignorant what hath béene the cause. My lord (said <HI>Gastilles</HI>) the Emperour my vncle so much desireth your company, that I ne∣uer saw man more gréeued, nor woman than the Princesse my cousin, when they perceiued the great serpent passe before Con∣stantinople, to crosse the straightes of Bosphore. I will shewe them what you say, and in the morning about breake of day, I meane, God willing, to set saile. Will you not (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) first goe visit <HI>Frandalo, Manely,</HI> and others, that lie wdunded in their beds, to know if they will send any message to the Empe∣perour? That I will (said <HI>Gastilles.</HI>) Goe then (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) and I will beare you companie. With that they went to <HI>Fran∣dalos</HI> lodging, where they were no sooner entred, but the watch that stood vpon the tower ouer the water gate, discouered about thrée miles in the sea, a great shippe that with full saile made to∣wards the towne: whereof they aduertised <HI>Gastilles,</HI> who pre∣sently caused two Brigandines to goe forth to sée if they were friends or enemies: and they were not long before they retur∣ned againe with the great shippe in their company, wherin were <HI>Palomir, Branfil, Helian le delibere, Garuate du Val Craintif, Bra∣uor</HI> sonne of the gyant <HI>Balan</HI> that king <HI>Amadis</HI> had newly made knight, <HI>Imosel de Burgoigne, Ledarin de Faiarque, Listoran de la tour Blanche, Trion</HI> cousin to quéene <HI>Briolanie, Tentilles le Super∣be, Guil le bien esteme Grodonan</HI> brother to <HI>Angriote Destra∣uaux,</HI> and the two sonnes of <HI>Isamie</HI> gouernour of the firme Isle, with many others that had imbarked themselues in great Bri∣taine to goe to aid <HI>Esplandian:</HI> and comming to the castle <HI>La mon∣taigne defendu,</HI> they had intelligence by the fishermen at sea, of the ouerthrow of <HI>Armatos</HI> nauie, his captiuitie, with the taking of the citie of Alfarin, whereat they much reioyced, especially when they knew by <HI>Gastilles</HI> souldiers that not any of their com∣panions were slaine in the assault. They béeing arriued at the towne, as they began to lande, <HI>Esplandian</HI> with diuers others went thither to receiue them: where betwéene them were ma∣ny salutations and welcomes giuen: which done, <HI>Esplandian</HI> led
<PB REF="72"/> them to his lodging, where they refreshed themselues about two houres, before they went to visit <HI>Frandalo,</HI> of whome <HI>Esplandian</HI> gaue such commendations, that they desired him to bring them where he lay, which hée presently did: but when <HI>Frandalo</HI> knew who they were (béeing ashamed to sée them vse such courtesie to him) could not well tel what to say: and as he entertained them, <HI>Palomir</HI> spake vnto him and said: Sir knight, I and my compa∣nie haue heard so great commendation of your valour, that there is not one of vs but would be ready to obey and serue you as our chiefe commander: wherefore, we beséech you, vse all diligence you may to be healed of your wounds, that we may presently go into the field vnder your conduction. My lords (said <HI>Frandalo</HI>) I pray you pardon me, I am well assured that my valour is none such as you report, whereby I deserue not the praise you giue me, neither did I euer any thing worthy commendation, but on∣ly by my lord <HI>Esplandians</HI> meanes. Neuerthelesse I hope, if God spareth me life and health, so to behaue my selfe, that all men shall know the desire I haue to doe seruice vnto Christendome, and particularly vnto euery one of you. Companion (said <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI>) I pray you take care to be cured of your griefe: that done, wée will take order for the rest: and for that these knightes are wearie with their long trauaile on the sea, I pray you giue them leaue for to depart, and in the morning we will visit you againe. Which he said, fearing least too much talke might cause him fall into a feuer, for <HI>Gastilles</HI> before that had béene deuising with him aboue two houres togither, touching the conference betwéene him and <HI>Esplandian</HI> as concerning his returne vnto the Empe∣rour. With that the knights bad him farewell, and went out of the chamber: on the other side <HI>Gastilles</HI> made all the hast he could to depart from thence the next day in the morning, and taking leaue of all his friends, the same night he entred into his ship: &amp; when day began to appeare, he set saile with so good winde, that within eight daies he discouered y<SUP>e</SUP> city of Cōstantinople, entring into the hauen: which y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperor vnderstanding, went to receiue him, &amp; going with him to the palace, asked him what he had done in his viage, &amp; whether <HI>Armato</HI> were retired frō the siege or not.
<PB REF="72"/> My lord (saied hee,) The good knight <HI>Esplandian</HI> and his company most humbly commend themselues vnto your grace, especially <HI>Frandalo,</HI> whom I can assure you to bee one of the best seruaunts that euer you had. With that the Empresse accompanied with the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> Quéene <HI>Minoresse,</HI> and diuers other la∣dies and Gentlewoman came thether, to whom <HI>Gastilles</HI> doing humble reuerence, they bad him welcome, and because hee staied to doe <HI>Esplandians</HI> commendations to the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> the Emperour said vnto him: Truly nephew, you shall make an end, to shewe vs what hath happened in your voiage, then if it please you you may court the ladies. Wherefore I pray you tell from the beginning what you haue done. My lord (saied he) at our departure from hence wee had so good a winde, that without any let wee arriued at the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> yet could wee not make such hast, but that <HI>Esplandian</HI> with his great Serpent, and <HI>Frandalos</HI> ships had already drowned and ouerthrowne cer∣taine of the enemies ships, and made the rest to flie, and the next day after king <HI>Armato</HI> was taken prisoner, his army ouer∣throwne and put to flight: but the sport was when I saluted the Turke, and that hee knew mee, then hee told the great rage the Turke was in, the threatnings and spéeches hee vsed vnto him, the ouerthrow of the twenty knights at the aduenturous foun∣taine, the skirmishes and assaults at the Towne of Alfarin, the danger wherein <HI>Esplandian</HI> and <HI>Frandalo</HI> found themselues, the taking of the Towne and of <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> her deliuery with the peo∣ples that fled to the temple of Iupiter, and how that before hee imbarked himselfe to returne, a great shippe arriued there from great Brittaigne with diuers knights therin, whose names and sirnames he rehearsed, as hauing séene them with king <HI>Amadis.</HI> Further my lord (said he) the good knight <HI>Esplandian</HI> willed me to shewe you that hee kéepeth king <HI>Armato</HI> till your grace shall dis∣pose of him, as also the citty of Alfarin, but for the castle <HI>La mon∣taigne defendu,</HI> hee saith hee mindeth not to yéeld the same to any other then to the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> in whose name hee hath conquered it, hoping as her seruaunt and no other to defend the same. When will he be here (saied the Emperour?) With all the
<PB REF="73"/> spéed hee may (saied <HI>Gastilles</HI>) as hee hath promised mee. In good faith (saied the Emperour) I would it were this day before to¦morrow, I haue so great desire to knowe him by reason of the great chiualry that daily increaseth in him, in such manner, that if heretofore the knight with the Gréene Sword hath béen estée∣med the best in all the world, now his sonne diminisheth a great part of his glory. And all being well considered, I thinke that <HI>Amadis</HI> hath not done more in tenne yeares time, then <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> hath accomplished in the space of tenne wéekes: But tou∣ching <HI>Frandalo,</HI> is hee so well disposed to our seruice as you make report? My lord (saied <HI>Gastilles,</HI>) It is not possible to doe bet∣ter then he hath done: wherefore, my lord <HI>Esplandian</HI> willed mee to shew you, that for the better entertaining him in his procée∣dings, hée is of aduise that your grace should giue him the citty of Alfarin, not knowing any man worthier then hee to kéepe it. In good truth (saied the Emperour) <HI>Esplandian</HI> and his companions haue had the paines to conquer it, wherefore I am content they haue the disposing thereof: Neuerthelesse, if they rest vpon my consent therein, I am well content it shall bee so, and I will not cease to shewe him greater fauour, if hee perseuer as hee hath begun. And you daughter (saied hee to the Princesse <HI>Leonorine</HI>) what say you to this that my cousin <HI>Gast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lles</HI> hath told you touching <HI>Esplandian,</HI> that sayeth hee kéepeth the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu</HI> for you onely? My lord (saied she) I know not how you and many others estéeme so much of him, conside∣ring the small obedience hee sheweth to his father, for if he were such a knight as hee is reported, hee had long since come hether to acquite the promise wherevnto hee is bound: which maketh mee verily thinke, the spéech <HI>Carmelle</HI> vsed of him, and all that hee hath sent you by word of mouth by my cousin <HI>Gastilles,</HI> are onely but dissimulations. And I for my part am not yet determi∣ned (although hee reporteth himselfe to bee my knight) to accept him for the same, much lesse to pardon him before hee comes in person to excuse his fault, then I will consider what I haue to doe. The emperor that perceaued his doughter speak with such a choler, &amp; therwith to blush more then ordinary, could not refrain
<PB REF="73"/> laughter, and saied vnto her. What daughter, doe you refuse the seruice of the best knight in all the world? I my lord (saied shee) and so should euery maister his seruant, when hee flieth from his presence, and obeyeth not his commandements no more then he hath done both yours and mine. Truly swéet heart (said the Em∣perour) I like you well, I would to God that nature had furni∣shed you with a bodie like vnto your heart, if shee had, shee had made you a perfect man, and not a woman as you are. Nowe ne∣phewe you heare my doughters answere, I pray you let <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> know it, that he may make hast hether, least he lose not her good will. And although the Emperour spake it as in iest, <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> tooke it otherwise when he heard the newes by a squire that <HI>Gastilles</HI> sent vnto him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII. How Frandalo accompanied of fourescore Knights, issued out of Alfarin towards Tesifant, and of the taking of Eiraca captaine of the Towne.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He knights of great Brittaigne arri∣ued in the Towne of Alfarin, (as you heard before) <HI>Frandalo</HI> and others that were hurt being healed of their woūds, <HI>Belleris</HI> that ceased not continually to hearken after <HI>Alphorax,</HI> was aduerti∣sed by his spies, that hee continued in the citty of Tesifannt, which hee and <HI>Branfil</HI> told vnto the rest of their com∣pany, who therewith being somewhat incouraged, very earnest∣ly desired <HI>Frandalo</HI> to lead thē forth, and bring them to some place where they might lie in ambush to surprise <HI>Alphorax</HI> or some of his companie if they chaunced to stray abroad. <HI>Frandalo</HI> not wil∣ling to deny them any reasonable request, agréed (with the
<PB REF="74"/> consent of <HI>Esplandian</HI>) to depart the next night following, and to take with thē to the number of fourescore knights and no more, which <HI>Esplandian</HI> liked well, he minding to bee one. Where vpon those that were appointed for the iourney prepared themselues, and about sunne setting issued out of Alfarin, <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Belle∣ris</HI> knowing y<SUP>e</SUP> country so well, that they néeded no other guides, but trauailed strait towards Tesifant, and hauing ridden till ele∣uen of the clocke at night, they came vnto a crosse way, where <HI>Frandalo</HI> aduised them to deuide themselues in two companies, willing the knights (that before that time had neuer ben in Tur∣kie) to hold close together. For (said he) the warres in these coun∣tries are far otherwise then they are in great Brittaigne, where knights vse most commonly to trauaile alone without compa∣ny, and although they chaunce sometimes to ride in companies, the least occasion that happeneth maketh them seperate them∣selues, but here those that vse armes trauaile in great companies together, whereby the combates that are fought here most com∣monly are rather battailes then incounters. And more then this, if thrée hundred Turkes chance to surprise one hundred, thirtie, twenty, or lesse number of their enemies, they take a pride to put them to death, preferring reuenge before a certaine kind of honour, that (as I haue vnderstoode) is kept and obserued in the West parts, where combates are in a manner equall. Where∣fore my friends (saied he) I pray you seperate not your selues, but march all in a company, assuring you that in the place whe∣ther wee goe, wee shall not faile to finde men sufficient against whome wee may imploy our forces, and shewe what valour is in vs. I knowe that within halfe a mile of Tesifant <HI>Alpho∣rax</HI> vseth oftentimes to lie at a house that hee hath caused to bee made called Gruobinach, where if it bee our good for∣tunes wee may chaunce to finde him, wherefore I am of aduise that we deuide our selues in two companies, my nephew <HI>Belleris</HI> shall take the left hand, and lie in ambush néere vn∣to the village of Ientinomele, from whence hee may easily perceaue when any man issueth out of Tesifant, and I with <HI>Esplandian</HI> and the other halfe of our companie will followe
<PB REF="74"/> this way that bringeth vs vnto a valley néere to Gruobinach, where we will secretly stay if néed require, to succour each other: whereunto they all agréed: but before they departed thence, they found their enterprise to be far more dangerous than they estée∣med it, as hereafter you shall heare. <HI>Belleris</HI> and his companie leauing <HI>Frandalo,</HI> trauailed so long, that about two houres before day they met fixe souldiours, whome <HI>Belleris</HI> saluted in the Ara∣bian language, asking them of what place they were. My Lord, said they, we are going to the towne of Srasse. My good friends (said he) we trauaile this night to Tesifante to aduertise y<SUP>e</SUP> prince <HI>Alphorax</HI> of the great dommage and destruction the Christian dogges continually doe and within short spade haue done vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> countrey round about: for they are issued out of Alfarin, &amp; haue taken and carried away all they can find: and as yet are abroad, not ceasing to execute all tyrannie they can deuise: neuertheles, if it pleaseth him to giue vs aid, wée know the place of their re∣trait, where we may easily inclose them, &amp; not one of them shall escape. What are you, said the souldiours, that bring vs these newes? Friends (said <HI>Belleris</HI>) I am <HI>Roussan,</HI> cousin to <HI>Eiraca,</HI> ehiefe captaine of Tesifant. We can tell you good newes of him, said the souldiours, wherewith we thinke you will be well plea∣sed: for he is not farre from hence, being ridden out of Tesifant with two hundred knights to goe vnto Falandie, to sée the same be not so lightly surprised as Alfarin was. But because he willed vs to ride before, wée will stay no longer: wherewith they hadde them farewell. Friends (said <HI>Belleris</HI>) the good fortune I wish you I pray God may happen vnto you. With that the souldiours passed on their way, but they had not gone farre when <HI>Belleris</HI> sent after them, and fearing they would discouer his enterprise, caused them to be slaine: and therewith presently dispatched one of his Squires on message to <HI>Frandalo,</HI> to aduertise him of the enemies béeing abroad with a verie strong and huge companie: whereupon hée wished him to ioyne with them. The Squire made all the hast hée could, but before the newes came to <HI>Fran∣dalo, Belleris</HI> met with <HI>Eiraca</HI> and his company about the vil∣lage of Ientinomele, béeing vpon them before they had time to
<PB REF="75"/> put on their helmets. There did the captaine of Tesifant shewe himselfe to be no yoong beginner in armes, for that like a valiant and hardy knight hee entered among the Christians, and being seconded by his men, did most valiantly defend themselues, and assailed the enemy, although at their first encounter ten of their brauest souldiours were vnhorsed and ouerthrowne. And as <HI>Ei∣raca</HI> entered into the prease, <HI>Norandel</HI> and he met together with such force, that <HI>Norandel</HI> was wounded in the left shoulder, but not sore hurt, and the captaine of Tesifant loosing his stirrops, was throwne ouer his horse with so great a strength, that with the fall hee was forced to lie vpon the ground, and could remooue neither hand nor foote, which the Turkes perceauing, to reléeue their captaine, did so valiantly, that they ouerthrew foure of the Brittish knights, who neuerthelesse rose presently againe, and with their swords in hand, thrust so many of the Turkes horses into the sides and flanckes, that in short space more then twentie of the Turkes were ouerthrowne likewise, and many slain out∣right: at that charge <HI>Enil</HI> and <HI>Gauarte</HI> were hurt, and the rest so hardly handeled, that without <HI>Frandalos</HI> company that came to succour them, they had all beene ourthrowne: and in truth they had almost straied too long, but the Squire that <HI>Belleris</HI> sent vnto them, could not ouertake them before they were in the valey where they should haue met. And although they had heard the sound of their blowes, yet did they not suspect any such perrill, vntill the squire had done his message, wherewith they ranne with all the spéed they could vnto the place, where <HI>Belleris</HI> and his companions (being out of breath) did nothing but recule, and defend themselues against their enemies blowes, that had slaine diuers of them, but that the captain of Tesifant would haue them to bee taken and presented to the Prince <HI>Alphorax:</HI> Neuerthe∣lesse <HI>Frandalo, Esplandian,</HI> and the rest of their company, made them change opinion: for when they perceaued their compani∣ons so hardly matched by the enemy, they entered among them with such fury, that had it not beene for <HI>Eiraca</HI> (who at that time behaued himselfe most valiantly) they had ouerthrown y<SUP>e</SUP> Turks at their first onset, but by reason of the great resistance hee
<PB REF="75"/> made, they continued fighting halfe an houre after, wherein hée maintained himselfe so well, that <HI>Esplandian</HI> could neuer take him before hée had ouerthrowne him, and pulled off his helmet, wherewith hée yéelded: meane time <HI>Frandalo</HI> and his compani∣ons being in the middle of the enemies, laide so well about them, slaying horses, pulling away shields, and doing so valiantly, that woonder it was to behold them, yet did not the Turkes once séeme abashed, but still fought most couragiously, vntil such time they perceiued their captaine taken prisoner, which caused them to flie and turne their backes: but not all of them, for there lay more than one hundred and fiftie of them dead vpon the ground, the rest saued themselues by meanes of the darke night. It was then about an houre before day: and <HI>Frandalo</HI> fearing that those of Tesifant (hearing of the ouerthrow) would issue foorth to cut off their passage, presently caused captaine <HI>Eiraca</HI> to be remoun∣ted, and all the Christians that wanted horses, and with all spéed rode backe againe to Alfarin, not the same way they came, but another way somewhat farther about; wherein they trauailed so long, that about sunne rising they entred into a great woode, where they alighted to refresh both themselues and their horses: and staying not long there least they should bée surprised, they made such spéed, that about sunne setting they arriued in y<SUP>e</SUP> town: meane time newes came to Tesifant of the ouerthrowe of their men, wherewith <HI>Alphorax</HI> was in such a rage, that in a man∣ner hée séemed desperate. But for this time wée haue sufficient∣ly discoursed of martiall affaires, now wée meane to bring Loue in place, who desiring to minister some comfort to the Princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> that liued in great paine, expecting the arriuall of her friend <HI>Esplandian,</HI> caused him to depart from Alfarin to visit her in the citie of Constantinople, as in the Chapters following you shall heare.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII. Of the great griefe Esplandian had, vnderstanding by the messen∣ger that Gastilles sent vnto him, what displeasure the Princesse Leonorine had conceiued against him.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OV heard before how <HI>Gastilles</HI> shewed the Emperour what <HI>Esplandian</HI> had done, and what message hée sent vnto him, and to the Princesse Leonorine, as also what answere she made, which <HI>Gastilles</HI> by his Squire writ and sent vnto him, hauing charge from the Emperour so to doe, thereby to procure his spéedier arriuall in Constantinople. The Squire with his lether made such hast, that hée arriued at Alfarin about fiue daies after the taking of <HI>Eiraca,</HI> and méeting <HI>Carmelle</HI> at the gate, asked her if he might find <HI>Esplandian</HI> at conuenient leisour to deliuer him a letter from <HI>Gastilles,</HI> but <HI>Carmelle</HI> being subtill, suspecting it to be some newes from the Prince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> that might mooue <HI>Esplandian,</HI> who as then séemed discontent, answered him &amp; said: My good friend, you can hardly speake with him at this time, but follow me and giue me the letter, and I will present it vnto him, and cause him to returne you an answere. The Squire did as she willed him, and followed her to <HI>Esplandians</HI> lodging: where entring into his chamber, she found him sitting vpon his bed tal∣king with the king of Denmarke, and deliuered him <HI>Gastilles</HI> letter, which when he read, the teares ranne out of his eyes, and therewith cast forth a great sigh, saying: O Lord? but <HI>Carmelle</HI> that beheld him, doubting the cause to be as she suspected, asked him if he were ill at ease. Ill? said he, I that I am, and so ill that I would to God I were dead: and looke I pray you, said he, whe∣ther I haue cause or not: wherewith stretching forth hish hand, he gaue <HI>Carmelle</HI> the letter, and turning his face, began to make the greatest sorrow in the world: but when shée had read the con∣tents, shée estéemed not thereof, but said vnto <HI>Esplandian:</HI> What
<PB REF="76"/> my Lord? are you abashed at so small a matter? By my soule I now perceiue very well, that the affections and loues of men are farre different and much vnlike the passions that we simple wo∣men endure, when we fall into the like extremities: and knowe you how? you men doe most commonly take pleasure to manifest and make known your loue either by word of mouth or outward shewes, and many times dissemble more than you meane to doe: and which is worse, how much the more the Lady or Gentlewo∣man you loue is of great desert, or high linage, so much more glo∣ry doe you take to make it knowne, not onely that you beare her affection, but that you are beloued and fauoured of her aboue all others: which is cleane contrary to the nature of women (I meane such as may bée tearmed wise and of good vnderstanding) for how much the greater their parentage is, so much more feare they haue to manifest their amorous passions, in such manner, that most commonly both in word, gesture, and countenāce, they outwardly denie that which they haue most déepely engraued in their hearts and mindes: and not without good cause, for that the thing which redoundeth to your praise and commendations (as you think, which is the manifesting of your loue) bréedeth to them a certaine spot in their honour, which often times they can not easily deface. Wherefore it is more than expedient, to obserue this modestie and constancie in vs, not that I meane to restraine my selfe vnto this lawe, séeing that all my glory and felicitie de∣pendeth vpon you, in such manner, that I desire no greater hap∣pinesse in this world, then that the loue and dutifull obedience I beare vnto you, should be published and made knowne vnto the world, to the end that all those that shall heare of your great va∣lour and my meane estate, may know my great good fortune, to haue the meanes to serue you as I doe. Wherefore my Lord, in my opinion you ought to take the spéeches <HI>Gastilles</HI> hath written vnto you, to be vsed by the lady <HI>Leonorine</HI> in good part and great∣ly to your aduantage, for I dare warrant you on mine honour, that your affections are both alike: and to say the truth, she hath behaued her selfe most wisely to dissemble the matter so well as she hath done in the Emperors presence. I deny not but she hath
<PB REF="77"/> some cause to be impatient, considering the message I deliuered vnto her in your behalfe, but that is easie to be cured: &amp; although the loue shée hath borne you so long time should be wholly extin∣guished (which I can hardly beléeue) euen as a bone that is bro∣ken in two péeces &amp; set togither againe, is stronger in that place than in any other part, so you being there and in her companie, shall winne that you finde broken, and by that meanes make it stronger than euer it was before. Therefore I am of aduise (that fulfilling her desire) you goe vnto her, and that as soone as possibly you may. Alas <HI>Carmelle</HI> (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) what good or what ser∣uice did I euer doe vnto her, thereby to haue deserued at her hands the least fauour among an infinite number I haue recei∣ued from her? specially by the report of your owne mouth. If therefore shee hath iust occasion to be offended with me, hauing offended her so much, can I hope for any other at her handes than méere disdaine and mortall hatred? My lord (said <HI>Carmelle</HI>) I am a woman and know the nature of women better than you doe, or then all the men in the world besides, I pray you there∣fore beléeue me, and go and sée her, and if so be shée entertaine you not according to your desire, then neuer giue credit to my words againe. In faith my good companion (said the king of Denmark) <HI>Carmelle</HI> giueth you so good and wise counsell, that either you ought to giue credit to her spéech, or els wholly driue this fantasie out of your mind, considering (as is most true) that sometimes, and very often, how much the more feruent and extreme the loue of a woman is, so much the sooner is it dead and wholly extingui∣shed, for that their inconstancie is such and so great, that for the least occasion in the world they are ouer ready to loue, and much more inconsiderately doe they forget the same againe: not that I accuse the Princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> of so great lightnes, but to say the truth as cōmonly we find, &amp; for my part I know not vpon what occasion you ground your loue, wherby you should make so much accoūt of her, séeing y<SUP>t</SUP> she neuer saw you, nor you her, but are on∣ly content to conceiue well of ech other vpon a certaine renowm y<SUP>t</SUP> hath spred abroad, &amp; set forth the great perfections y<SUP>t</SUP> are repor∣ted to be in you both: which in truth may bée compared to a fire
<PB REF="77"/> made of straw, y<SUP>t</SUP> is no sooner kindled but presētly cōsumed: wher∣fore be not then so much abashed if y<SUP>e</SUP> princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> shew her selfe at this presēt so smally affected towards you, for those y<SUP>t</SUP> loue most déerly do oftentimes fall into discurtesies &amp; coldnes of affec∣tion, that they disdaine, or (at the least) in the twinkling of an eie, wholly forget those that for a long time they haue loued most in∣tirely, &amp; that for their sakes shal haue hazarded their liues in most dangerous aduentures. Did you neuer heare how <HI>Brisarde</HI> beha∣ued her selfe in regard of <HI>Troilus,</HI> after the destruction of Troy, shée loued him so well that she would néeds die in his armes: whē she was constrained to forsake him, the Gréekes thinking verily she would haue slaine her selfe: &amp; yet was shée scarse issued out of Troy but she wholly forgot her loue <HI>Troilus,</HI> &amp; transported that vehement loue she had borne him all her life, to <HI>Diomedes</HI> king of Thrace. O God? What inconstancie? what lightnes? what foundation vpon a sandy groūd was that? This vnconstant wo∣man among other precious ornaments giuen her by <HI>Troilus</HI> her friend, had a paire of perfumed gloues, which within one houre after her captiuitie she gaue vnto her new friend <HI>Diomedes</HI> in to∣ken of the loue &amp; amity she bare vnto him. What had <HI>Troilus</HI> said then if he had béen present? would he haue beléeued her? I thinke not. And what a point of honestie, I pray you, did <HI>Clitemnestra</HI> shew vnto her husband, when in stéed of welcoming him home at his comming from the siege of Troy, where he had remained ten yéers togither? she caused him cruelly to be murdered by <HI>Egistus</HI> her ruffian. But will you heare more exāples of the like matter? &amp; as he began to procéed, <HI>Esplandian</HI> said vnto him, My good friend, I pray you do not this wrong vnto my lady <HI>Leonorine,</HI> but let me here your counsell how I may from henceforth gouerne my selfe to satisfie her desire. Go &amp; sée her, said y<SUP>e</SUP> king, &amp; if you think good I will beare you cōpany. Shall we go &amp; leaue our cōpanions? (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) y<SUP>t</SUP> wil I neuer do: wherfore? said y<SUP>e</SUP> king: are not <HI>Fran∣dalo, Manely,</HI> &amp; the rest of their cōpany strong inough to defend y<SUP>e</SUP> town in your absence? I am of aduise y<SUP>t</SUP> you send presētly for thē, &amp; giue them to vnderstand y<SUP>t</SUP> by reason of certain newes you haue of late receiued, you must be constrained to leaue them for the
<PB REF="78"/> space of eight or fiftéene daies: and in like sort dispatch <HI>Gastilles</HI> Squire, and write vnto his master, that you thanke him hearti∣ly for the good remembrance he hath had of you, and that with all spéed you will send a messenger expressely vnto the Emperour with an answere to that it hath pleased him to command to bée written vnto you: in the meane time, I will take order to pre∣pare a ship to bring vs to the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> where wée will imbarke our selues in the great Serpent, that will not faile (as I thinke) to bring vs vnto Constantinople, and deter∣mine with your selfe what companie you meane to take with you. My good friend (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) doe as you thinke good, I am content to hazzard my life in your hands. It suffiseth (said the king) but I pray you speake vnto our companions, and dis∣patch the squire. With that <HI>Esplandian</HI> called for inke and paper, and wrote vnto <HI>Gastilles</HI> as the king of Denmarke had aduised him. Next day in the morning <HI>Frandalo</HI> and the rest of the com∣panie came into his chamber as they vsed ordinarily to doe, and being togither deuising of diuers things, <HI>Esplandian</HI> said vnto them: My good friends, I am constrained to leaue your compa∣ny for the space of fiftéene daies or three wéekes, to goe about cer∣tain vrgent affaires y<SUP>t</SUP> import me much: I will take with me my brother the king of Denmarke, <HI>Gandalin, Enil, Carmelle,</HI> and no more. I pray you thinke it not strange, for if I were not constrai∣ned thereunto, I sweare vnto you of my faith, I would not do it. There was not any among them that once would aske him whe∣ther he went, but answering him, said: That he might goe whi∣ther it pleased him, &amp; that they for their parts would kéepe y<SUP>e</SUP> place till he came againe, although he staid a whol yéer before he retur∣ned; by this means <HI>Esplandian</HI> by little &amp; little framed himselfe to take his voiage while y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Denmarke caused the ship that brought the knights of great Britain thither, to be made ready, &amp; vpon a monday in the morning <HI>Esplandian</HI> &amp; his company imbar∣ked themselues to saile vnto the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> but they were no sooner put to sea, but the wind falling contrary, the sea rose so high &amp; so furious withall, y<SUP>t</SUP> neither mast, saile, nor cord could hold, but brake all in péeces: in which maner they cōtinued
<PB REF="78"/> for the space of tenne daies and as many nights, so that neither maister nor marriners could tell in what part they were, for that during that time, the clouds were so thicke and the mist so great, that it made the aire so darke and obscure, that those that were in the shippe could scarse sée one the other, expecting nothing else (without the mercy of God) then the ouerthrow of their shippe: which they thought verily had happened, when they arriued at the rocke of the Enchauntresse, wherevpon they were driuen a∣bout thrée of the clocke after midnight: wherewith the saylers cast anker, and going on land, staied till day appeared.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII. How Esplandian and his company went vp vnto the broken pallace of the Enchaunteresse, and of the straunge thinges they found there.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>Splandian</HI> and his company being on land, not knowing the place where they were arriued, caused a great fire to bee made, about the which they thought to lie downe and sléepe, but they heard such a noise from the top of the rocke, that they were all abashed: with that the winde be∣gan to cease, and the sea to waxe calme, the skie shewing full of starres, and withall the mone shone so bright, that it séemed as light as if it had ben day: wherefore <HI>Esplandian</HI> desirous to know what the noise might bee, determined to mount vp the rocke, but he was counselled by his company to stay till the next day in the morning. When <HI>Esplandian</HI> knew it certainely to be the rocke of the Enchauntresse, and saied vnto the king of Denmarke: In good truth I thinke I haue beene here before and take it to be the place whether the great Serpent brought me the same day I re∣ceaued the order of knighthood, which putteth mee in better hope of our voiage then I had before: which he saied, remembring the scroll with the prophesie that he found in the lions paw. Then he told the king of Denmarke how he conquered the sword he bare,
<PB REF="79"/> the death of the serpent, &amp; all y<SUP>t</SUP> he had séene vpon the rocke, &amp; it is called (said he) the rock of the Enchauntresse. By God (said <HI>Gan∣dalin</HI>) you say trew, for I remember, that pursuing after a knight y<SUP>t</SUP> led a Gentlewoman away, I found your father king <HI>Amadis</HI> &amp; <HI>Grandasor</HI> here, &amp; the knight likewise y<SUP>t</SUP> I sought y<SUP>t</SUP> had hiddē him∣self in y<SUP>e</SUP> old pallace vpō this rock: thē he told thē frō point to point what had happened vnto him, &amp; the great loue y<SUP>e</SUP> knight bare vn∣to y<SUP>e</SUP> gentilwomā he had carried away by force, but (said he) before we departed she agréed with him, &amp; they promised mariage to ech other, although before y<SUP>e</SUP> time shée hated him most deadly: neuer∣theles, vnderstanding y<SUP>t</SUP> the force he vsed vnto her was only done for y<SUP>e</SUP> loue he bare her, she clean forgot her former hatred, chāging it to a most excéeding loue. In good faith (saied <HI>Carmelle</HI>) as farre as I perceiue, no man ought to dispaire of any thing hée taketh in hand, no more will I during my life: which shee said in respect of <HI>Esplandian,</HI> who in time as shée thought might loue her, &amp; whollie forget y<SUP>e</SUP> Princes <HI>Leonorine.</HI> And so long they talked, y<SUP>t</SUP> day began to apear, thē <HI>Esplandian</HI> said to y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Denmark: Cōpanion, I pray you stay here forme while I goe vp, for I wil haue no body w<SUP>t</SUP> me but <HI>Gandalin</HI> &amp; <HI>Enil,</HI> &amp; they shal go with me, not y<SUP>t</SUP> I fear any danger y<SUP>t</SUP> may happē vnto me, but only because they may help me to lift vp y<SUP>e</SUP> tomb wherof I told you euē now. My lord (said y<SUP>e</SUP> king) I pray you offer me not so much iniury, for I will not leaue you though it cost mee my life, especially in this place where I haue most great desire to sée that I neuer saw before. Séeing it is your pleasure (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) let vs go, &amp; let our squires bring some vi∣ctuals with them, if we néed to eat before we come backe againe: which the squires did, wherwith they began to mount vp y<SUP>e</SUP> rock, and trauelled so long, that about sunne setting they came vnto the hermitage, where y<SUP>e</SUP> great image was erected, wherof you heard before, where they stayed all night, the next day they trauelled a∣gain, &amp; came vnto the lake y<SUP>t</SUP> ran before the old pallace, &amp; because it began to be dark, they determined not to trauel any further for y<SUP>e</SUP> time, &amp; to say the truth they were weary: but all night y<SUP>e</SUP> serpēts y<SUP>e</SUP> issued out of their holes to drink of the water, ceased not to hisse and passe before &amp; about them to assaile them, which they had not
<PB REF="79"/> failed to doe, had it not beene for the vertue of <HI>Esplandians</HI> sword, wherevnto no venomous thinges might once approch or come néer. Neuerthelesse they rested not, but as soon as they might sée, rose vp &amp; went on their way: and passing by the ruinated monu∣mēts, they came vnto the pallace of the enchantresse, where they found y<SUP>e</SUP> gates shut, wherat <HI>Esplandian</HI> gaue so great a blow with his foot, y<SUP>t</SUP> they opened, &amp; they entred into the place where the shi∣ning tombe stood with the lion vpon it. Then <HI>Esplandian</HI> said vnto the thrée knights: In good faith when I was here before, I could not lift vp this plate, I pray you each man prooue what you can do, then I wil sée if I be grown stronger in the back thē I was at that time: wherwith the king of Denmark assailed to doe it, but what strength so euer hée vsed, it was impossible for him, the like did <HI>Gandalin</HI> &amp; <HI>Enil,</HI> but they sped no better then the king, wherat <HI>Esplandian</HI> began to laugh, &amp; taking it by the two ends, lifted it vp so easily as if it had been a péece of dry wood, yet was it a péece of christall of thrée fingers thick, &amp; about ten or twelue foote long: vnder it they found an azure stone, the fairest &amp; most orient color y<SUP>t</SUP> euer was séene y<SUP>e</SUP> couered a Ceader chest which smelt as swéet as any balme, y<SUP>e</SUP> chest being shut with a loc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> emerald stone, ha∣uing a key of diamōds y<SUP>t</SUP> hong by it at a cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of fine gold, al most artificially cōposed: the stone takē vp &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> chest opened, they found the image of Iupiter lying therein all of massy gold, garnished with many pearles, rubies, &amp; other inestimable rich iewels, espe∣cially a crown y<SUP>t</SUP> he ware on his head, about y<SUP>t</SUP> which were placed certain Carboncles inform of Gréeke letters, with these words.</P>
<P><HI>Iupiter is great god of all gods, &amp; in his right hand he bare a table cōtaining this prophesie, Whē time shal come, that my art &amp; know∣ledge shal faile, the hart of the Hind inclosed herein, &amp; life restored by thē that were the cause of death, the Grecian sheep long time no∣rished in plesant pastures, shalbe cōstrained to feed on a herb bitterer thē gal, by means of the extremity the hūgry sea wolues shal put thē vnto, whose number shall be so great, that they shall couer the sea in diuers places, in such wise, that the poore sheep inclosed in their great forrest, &amp; diuers of their lambes being dead and torn in peeces, their sheepheard (hauing in a maner lost all hope of restoring thē againe)
<PB REF="80"/> with anguish of heart and mind, in abundance of teares shall lament their great misfortune. Then shall come the braue Lions whelpe, by whose meanes that great troope of wolues shall be driuen away and destroyed. Neuerthelesse, hee shall take from the sheepeheard his great power, and the best beloued of his sheepe, wherevpon he shal seaze, in such sort, that his strong teeth and sharpe clawes shall enter into her heart, and the entrailes of her body, the rest of the flocke resting in the power and gouernement of him and his fierce com∣pany, whereby not long after it shall come to passe, that the great de∣ceitfull Serpent, the inchaunted sword, and this high rocke, shal sink into the bottome of the sea, and shall neuer after be seene againe of any man.</HI></P>
<P>But although <HI>Esplandian</HI> vnderstoode the Gréeke tongue, yet could he not giue any interpretation or exposition to this prophe∣sie, no more could any of his company: wherefore they determi∣ned not to stay long about the same, but were more busied to be∣hold the stones and great riches they sawe within the tombe, which they determined to take with them, and return vnto their ships without staying any longer, for their victuals began to fail: wherefore <HI>Esplandi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> willed <HI>Carmelle</HI> to take the Lion, hee and the king of Denmarke tooke the plate of christall, <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> the azure stone, and the Squires the Ceader chest with the Image of Iupiter. And in that sort they issued out of the pallace, descending downe the rocke, till about euening they came vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> hermitage, where they staied all night: the next day they went on till they found their ship, wherein about sunsetting they im∣barked themselues: and because <HI>Esplandian</HI> would not be séene in Constantinople without the great Serpent, hée commanded the master of the ship to direct his course to the castle called <HI>La mon∣taigne defendu,</HI> which he did. But hauing sailed about two daies &amp; more, as the king of Denmark sat talking with <HI>Esplandian</HI> about the letter that was sent vnto him, hee asked him if he thought not good y<SUP>t</SUP> he should make a voiage vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> Princesse <HI>Leonorine</HI> to vn∣derstand the truth of her affection towards him. For (saied hee) it may be <HI>Gastilles</HI> hath mistaken her words, or the Emperor him∣selfe hath commanded him to write vnto you in such sort, y<SUP>t</SUP> therby
<PB REF="80"/> you should make the more hast to goe thether: at the least I shall know of her what her pleasure is, and how you shal gouern your selfe in respect of her. Ha my good friend (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) you haue toucht me now euen at the quicke, If you would doe me so much fauour, you shall bind mee for euer vnto you: meane time I will stay for you in the gulfe where I found you with <HI>Frandalo,</HI> when we raised y<SUP>e</SUP> siege of the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> Assure your selfe (said the king) I will do my good will. There was belonging to their ship a little Pinnace, which the maister tooke with him (besides the boat) to saue himselfe and his people if any tempest should happen, wherin the king with certain martiners to guide him entred, and taking their leaue of <HI>Esplandian,</HI> sailed forwards with so good a winde, y<SUP>t</SUP> in short space they lost the sight of y<SUP>e</SUP> great ship. But the next night following there happened such a tēpest, that at the breake of day their Pilot knew not where hee was, &amp; without knowledge of the place he was constrained to abandon the Pinnace vnto the mercy of the waues, which continued for the space of forty daies together, in which time they indured so many fortunes, that it would be ouertedious to recount them, and wée should likewise digresse from the matter whereinto wee are entered, to bring our history vnto an end. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et it therefore suffice you to know, that their victuals being spent, they chanced to ar∣riue in the Island of the Giant <HI>Drapheon,</HI> where y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Den∣marke and his squire lost their wits and became mad, by force of a water that they drunk out of a fountain called The fountain of Forgetfelnesse, that sprang in that Isle, where they were taken &amp; kept in a cruel prison, frō whence in short time after they were deliuered by the meanes of a Gentlewoman that fel in loud with the king, and caused him to recouer his health, armes, horse, and a ship, with all things necessary for himselfe and his squire, and hauing done, she with them put to sea: and coasting the countrey of Treuisane, they came vnto an Island where the people of the countrey would haue burnt a Gentlewoman because shee could not find a knight for to maintaine her quarrel: but y<SUP>e</SUP> king fought for her, and ouercame him that accused her, &amp; taking the Gentle∣woman with him, put to sea againe, &amp; sailing sixe daies together
<PB REF="81"/> along the coast, hée perceiued a maid out of a tower, where in the lord of y<SUP>e</SUP> country kept her prisoner, for the cause which shee decla∣red to the king out of a window that looked into the sea, for whose sake the king took land to fight with the lord till hée deliuered the poor gentle woman out of prison: such were the aduentures of the king of Denmark, which are rehearsed at large in y<SUP>e</SUP> great chro∣nicles, that master <HI>Elizabeth</HI> wrote not long after the coronation of <HI>Esplandian:</HI> wherein the prowesse &amp; aduentures of the Brittish knights and others remaining at Alfarin, are likewise registred &amp; orderly set downe. For this time content your selues to vnder∣stand the maner how &amp; in what sort <HI>Esplandian</HI> and the Princesse <HI>Leonorine</HI> saw each other, how afterward <HI>Vrganda</HI> came to Con∣stantinople, of y<SUP>e</SUP> armies both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y land &amp; sea, of the cruell battaile betwéen the Turks &amp; Christians: which ended, our history like∣wise shall be finished, but hauing many things to describe, before I come to that point, we will returne to <HI>Esplandian,</HI> that was not smally abashed at the long absence of the King, expecting frō day to day some newes of him, that had left his company only for the cause you heard before.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV. How Esplandian hauing staied Garinter king of Denmarks returne about two weekes space, and perceiuing no news of him, determi∣ned (by the counsell of Carmelle) to goe in person to the citty of Constantinople.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter that <HI>Garinter</HI> King of Denmarke had set saile to∣wards Constantinople as it is saied before, <HI>Esplandians</HI> ship arriued at the gulfe where he promised to stay, and there lay at anker for the space of two wéekes, not hea∣ring any news of his desired message: wherewith he doubted ei∣ther that the king of Denmarke should bee drowned, or that for∣tune had carried his vessel some other way: wherfore he thought to send one of his marriners to enquire of him. But before hee did it, he determined first to speak with <HI>Carmelle,</HI> and taking her
<PB REF="81"/> aside, saied vnto her: My great friend, you know for what cause the king of Denmarke left vs, &amp; the reason of his voiage, as also the promise he made vnto me to returne again with all spéed, but we can heare no news of him at all, which maketh me assuredly beléeue either hee is dead, or that the storme hee was in hath cast him in some country so far off, that he cannot by any meanes doe as he hath promised, wherefore I pray you giue mee your aduise what I were best to doe: for those that are in the like mind that I am, although in some thinges they haue their vnderstandings whole and perfect, yet are they commonly to séeke in that which concerneth them as touching those points. My lord (saied she) sée∣ing it is your pleasure to vse my counsel, I wil tel you truly what I thinke therein, and so much I can assure you, that if you should search throughout the world, you shall hardly finde one that can come néere mee in iudging the passion wherewith you are mole∣sted: for the same is in me that is in you, and I féele it as well as you doe, and it may bée more, but the ease and great contentment I receiue by your presence, haue giuen mee so many remedies, that I delight in my greefe and liue not, but only to cause my sor∣row to indure. To tell you truth, at such time as you began to vse spéeche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto mée of the king of Denmarke, I thought vpon his long ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ente, and me thinketh it were best wee sailed vnto Con∣stantinople, assuring you that I haue deuised a meanes to bring you vnto the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> whereby you may both sée and speake with her, without being knowne of any other then her selfe, if you thinke it good. And to bring it to passe, (we being arri∣ued there) it shal be necessary that all those of our ship be aduerti∣sed (if any man asketh for you) to say, that you staied in the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> meane time you shall lie in the bottome of the shippe, and I with <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil,</HI> will goe vnto the Em∣perour, to whome I will say that you sent mee to the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> to present vnto her in your behalfe, that which you haue conquered in the rocke of the Enchauntresse, and for the rest let mee alone. When <HI>Esplandian</HI> heard her speake in that manner, hee behelde her for a while, and at last saied vnto her: My good friend, I feare not death, neither can it bee
<PB REF="82"/> more bitter or sharper vnto me then the life I now indure: but I feare the dishonour of my lady, &amp; the iniury that thereby I might do vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperor, who by his courtesie hath so much bound my father vnto him, as if I shuld wrong him, it would be a blemish to my honor while I liue. Neuerthelesse, I am content to hazard my self in all the dangers you shal think conuenient: that is sufficient (said <HI>Carmelle</HI>) I pray you then be merry &amp; make good chear: for if euer woman accomplished the thing she took in hand, I wil bring this to passe. Wherwith leauing <HI>Esplandian,</HI> she called y<SUP>e</SUP> Patron, &amp; willed him to set saile for Constantinople, whervnto he obaied, &amp; had so good a wind, y<SUP>e</SUP> within thrée daies after they entred into y<SUP>e</SUP> hauē: where being arriued, <HI>Esplandian</HI> told his men what (by the coūsel of <HI>Carmelle</HI>) he had determined to do, cōmāding thē expresse¦ly not to make it known to any man of his being there, but y<SUP>t</SUP> they should say they left him in y<SUP>e</SUP> castle <HI>La montaigne defendu.</HI> For (said he) I am not now in such estate as I would be to presēt my self be∣fore so great a prince as y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperor is. And to the end you be not found liers, I will stay in the bottome of the ship till you returne againe: then he, <HI>Carmelle, Gandalin</HI> &amp; <HI>Enil</HI> spake together, where the gentlewomā shewed thē at large how she meant to bring hir enterprise to passe, I will presently (said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e) cause the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he wee brought from y<SUP>e</SUP> rock of y<SUP>e</SUP> enchauntresse to be set vp in y<SUP>e</SUP> same sort we found it, vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> hatches of the ship thē wil I go tel the empe∣ror y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue one of the singularest things abord y<SUP>e</SUP> ship y<SUP>t</SUP> euer was séen, &amp; we find means to bring him hether, where I wil shew him the lion with Iupiter, &amp; al the rest of the furniture, which hauing séene and peruse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I will tell him that you send it to the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> He being gone vnto his palace, you shall goe into the Ceader chest, and so will I cause you to be carried into the prin∣cesse chamber lying in the arme, whereof I will secretly aduer∣tise her, and by this meanes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he may speake to you; and you to hir what you thinke good. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (said <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plandian</HI>) tell mee how I shall come out againe? I wil desire her (said she) to giue me the ceader theft, therein to be by the body of <HI>Marroco</HI> that died a Christian, wherein you shall had in closed, and tomorrow in the morning I will cause you to be brough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> againe. By God (said <HI>Gan∣dalin</HI>) it is the prettiest deuise that euer I heard, &amp; now I confesse
<PB REF="82"/> that I was neuer but a foole in regard of <HI>Carmelle.</HI> Meddle you not with any thing (said shée) but rest content, let me alone to worke my will, and to the same end let vs presently begin: then <HI>Esplandian</HI> went downe into the bottome of the ship, and the gen∣tlewoman prepared the tombe as shée had determined before: with that shée, <HI>Gandalin,</HI> and <HI>Enil,</HI> landed and went vnto the Em∣perour, whome they saluted most honourably, but <HI>Carmelle</HI> did him no reuerence: for (as it is said before) she estéemed not of any man liuing how great a Prince soeuer hee were, but only of <HI>Es∣plandian:</HI> shée and <HI>Gandalin</HI> were knowne in Constantinople by reason of their being there before. Wherefore the Emperour receiued <HI>Gandalin</HI> very courteously, and with smiling counte∣nance said vnto him: Friend <HI>Gandalin,</HI> although your presence hath procured great melancholly in my minde, remembring I haue often séene you here with the man, that in all Christendome I most entirely loue, whome I am vtterly persuaded I shall ne∣uer sée againe, yet you are heartily welcome, and I pray you tell me how doth the knight with the Gréene Sword. My lord (said <HI>Gandalin</HI>) it is long since I left him to come into this countrey, neuerthelesse I am assured wheresoeuer he is, he is a Prince rea∣dy to doe your grace any pleasure he can. In good faith (said the Emperour) I beléeue it well, and I am glad of the honour I vnderstand hée hath receiued at the hands of king <HI>Luisart,</HI> that vo∣luntarily hath deposed himselfe of all princely dignitie to inuest him therewith. My lord (said <HI>Enil</HI>) that is true, I can assure your Grace thereof as one that was present as his Coronation: and although I could wish king <HI>Amadis</HI> the Monarch of all y<SUP>e</SUP> world, Truly when I beheld the gesture and humble countenance of good king <HI>Luisart</HI> I could not refraine wéeping; for compassion I had to sée him, and not I onely, but all the people that beheld him. I pray you, Sir Knight (said the Emperor) shew me how it was, for that all wise men are bound not onely to enquire of all vertu∣ous actions, but also to imitate them as néere as possibly they may: with that <HI>Enil</HI> shewed him at large the whole order of the same, as you heard it before. Whereat the Emperour (hol∣ding downe his head) mused for a while, and then said: I am cer∣tainly
<PB REF="83"/> persuaded it will be long before we find a better prince thā king <HI>Luisart</HI> is, or one y<SUP>t</SUP> hath passed his young yéeres with more wisedome and magnanimitie of courage, and as I vnderstand, both fortune and vertue haue béen fauourable vnto him: fortune in giuing him force to ouercome and obtaine honour against di∣uers misfortunes and hard aduentures that she her selfe had pre∣pared for him: and vertue, for that in the end of his daies she hath set him in the way to enter into paradise. And leauing that d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦course, hée changed purpose and spake to <HI>Carmelle,</HI> of whome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣iest he asked, if she were still tormented with the extreame passi∣ons of loue towards <HI>Esplandian</HI> as she had béen in times past. My Lord (said she) if there be any chaunge since I spake with you, it is, that the loue, seruitude, &amp; affection I beare vnto him, are aug∣mented in me, and daily more and more increase. Whereat eue∣ry man began to laugh. In good faith (said the Emperour) wée may then very wel persuade our selues, that you came not to our Court to moue any of our Gentlewomen to loue the good knight your master, although he should expressely commaund you to doe it. My lord (said shee) you iudge as in reason it ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, neuer∣thelesse I take so great a pleasure in seruing him to his content∣ment, that I will except no seruice whatsoeuer: and to speake truth, my arriuall here is to aske your Grace a gift, neither gold nor siluer, but onely that it would please you to goe vnto the ha∣uen, to sée a Present that my Lord <HI>Esplandian</HI> sendeth to the prin∣cesse <HI>Leonorine</HI> as her knight. In good truth (said the Emperor) you require a thing at our hands, that we should rather desire at yours. Come then my Lord (said shée) for I may not stay long here. With that the Emperour (accompanied of diuers Noble¦men) went vnto the hauen, and being there, entred into <HI>Carmel∣les</HI> shippe, shee shewed him the christall tombe, then that of azure stone, and lastly the image of <HI>Iupiter:</HI> whereat the Emperour stayed longer to behold it than the rest, not so much for the rich∣nesse thereof, as to read the prophecie it held; and hauing read it, was not a little abashed: which <HI>Carmelle</HI> perceiuing, spake vnto him and said: My lord, all this you sée hath continued aboue two hundred yéeres in the broken palace of the inchantresse, yet in all
<PB REF="83"/> that time not any knight (how valiāt soeuer he were) could euer conquer the same, nor yet so much as sée it, vntill my lord <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> arriued there, that is become Lord and possessour of y<SUP>e</SUP> same, as you now behold. Truly (said the Emperour) it is the goodliest present that euer I saw, and worthy the greatest admiration: for although it be of incomparable riches, yet doe I estéeme it of no value in respect of the great science and wonderfull knowledge that was in her to whome it first belonged, as she maketh it well appeare by the threatnings she vsed against vs in this table: God graunt all may fall out better than I doubt it will. My lord (said <HI>Carmelle</HI>) although it be such as you estéeme it, yet doe I feare that my Lady your daughter will not make so much account thereof, that in recompence of the same she will acquite the good knight <HI>Amadis</HI> and the master that I serue, of the promise they haue made vnto her. I know not that (said the Emperour) but I am well assured, that no earthly treasure can be comparable vn∣to the valour &amp; vertue of your master: neither will I euer giue my consent that <HI>Leonorine</HI> shall make that exchange, as desiring the company of <HI>Esplandian,</HI> much more than to haue all the trea∣sures in the world within my coffers: and with good reason, for that the wickedest person liuing on the earth may be rich of gold and siluer, but not of vertue, which is not aboundant vnto any but to those that séeke it: wherefore if you thinke good, carry your presents backe againe, for <HI>Esplandian</HI> can not be acquited vnto vs but onely by his presence. My Lord (said <HI>Carmelle</HI>) I am com∣maunded to leaue them with the Princes <HI>Leonorine,</HI> whether it bée vpon that condition or not and if it be your pleasure (séeing she is not come hither with you) I will cause it to be carried in∣to her chamber. My daughter (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Emperour) is with her mother the Empresse about a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> hence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ake the aire, when she commeth home you may present it vnto her, and assure your selfe she will not refuse it: not so much for the value thereof, as for the good I wish to him that sent it her, as shée knoweth full well. Wherewith hée departed out of the shippe, and béeing a land walked towardes his palace, not without much talke with his knights &amp; noble men, touching the excellencie of y<SUP>e</SUP> tomb.
<PB REF="84"/> Which the more they spake of, the more they estéemed it, in such manner, that they all acknowledged neuer in their liues to haue séene so rich nor so singular a present.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI. How Esplandian was put into the Cedar chest, and with the tombe carried into the Princesse Leonorines chamber, and what confe∣rence they had togither.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Emperour and his company gon as it is said before, <HI>Carmelle</HI> called <HI>Esplandian,</HI> that in the meane time lay in the bottome of the shippe, and told him the manner of their procéedings, as also the spéech the Emperour had with <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil,</HI> &amp; all what had happened, as it is before re∣hearsed. By my soule (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) I was neuer in the like paine, for hearing all you speake, only the lady <HI>Leonorine,</HI> I could not tell what to thinke: but when y<SUP>e</SUP> Em∣perour told you she was not in the citie, beléeue me, it comforted my heart. Did not I play my part well? said <HI>Carmelle.</HI> That you did, and as well as one could wish, (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) and if it be true which is commonly said: That a good beginning makes a good ending, I hope I shall not faile to bring my purpose to passe. And while they deuised togither it waxed night, so that the Empresse returned into the citie which <HI>Carmelle</HI> vnderstāding, caused <HI>Esplandian</HI> present<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to lie downe in the Cedar chest, in such sort, that the aire entred therein on all sides, and couering it with the Azure and Christall stones, <HI>Gandalin, Enil,</HI> and their Squires tooke the tombe, and with the gentlewoman went out of the ship and came vnto the palace, where they found the Lady <HI>Leonorine</HI> (béeing already aduertised of the goodly Present sent her by <HI>Esplandian</HI>) in great deuotion staying for <HI>Carmelle,</HI> for it had béene tolde her, that in the euening she would bring it to her lodging: wherefore she had no sooner espied it, but she (with many
<PB REF="84"/> other ladies and gentlewomen no lesse curious to behold y<SUP>e</SUP> same) met her in the hall. With that <HI>Carmelle</HI> (perceiuing her come) stepped forward, and doing reuerence vnto her, said: Madame, y<SUP>e</SUP> good knight <HI>Esplandian</HI> sendeth you this Present, y<SUP>e</SUP> not long since he conquered in the rocke of the enchantresse, according to y<SUP>e</SUP> good fortune &amp; happy destiny aboue a hundred yeres past predestinated of him: which he sendeth vnto you, expresly to giue you to vnder∣stand the great desire that daily more &amp; more increaseth in him to be your faithfull knight. But before you procéed further, it is con∣uenient you grant me two requests: the one, that neither you nor any other shall looke into the tombe vntill the morning that I re∣turne againe with the keye to open a Cedar chest, that you shall find therin: the other, that after you haue opened it you shall giue it me, to carry with me to the place, where my father kéepeth his hermitage, therein to bury the bones of <HI>Matroco</HI> that died a chri∣stian, as you haue vnderstood. <HI>Carmelle</HI> my friend (said y<SUP>e</SUP> princes) that am I content to doe: neuerthelesse I am much abashed why <HI>Esplandian</HI> deferreth the time so long before he commeth to sée the Emperour. Madame (said shee) I will tell you that to morrow: meane time, I pray you, determin where you will haue our men to set downe their charge. In the great hall (said <HI>Leonorine</HI>) that my gentlewomen may sée it at their ease. In faith madame, you shall pardon me (said <HI>Carmelle:</HI>) this place is too open and ouer common to leaue so precious a thing standing therein: I denie not to let them haue the pleasure to behold it, but hauing séene it, for the more safetie it shall be set into your owne chamber, wher∣of you and none other shall haue the keye. With that they that bare the tombe, entered into the hall and set it downe till <HI>Leono∣rine</HI> and the rest of the gentlewomen had beheld it long: and if <HI>Carmelle</HI> had not béene there; assure your selues it had béene bet∣ter visited than it was: but she would not depart from thence till it was shut vp. Which done, taking her leaue, as shée went out she tooke the Princes aside, and giuing her the keye of the chest wherein <HI>Esplandian</HI> lay, said vnto her: Madame, I leaue you in this tombe two inestimable treasures, although their difference be great, as you may will perceiue you being alone: for it is
<PB REF="85"/> sure, that vnder this keye lyeth the thing, y<SUP>t</SUP> in all the world you most desire to sée: &amp; without staying <HI>Leonorines</HI> answer, she went out of the chamber, and with <HI>Gandalin</HI> and his company retur∣ned to the ship, leauing the princes in a maruellous doubt by rea∣son of the words shee vsed vnto her: &amp; there with did so certainely persuade her selfe, that her friend <HI>Esplandian</HI> lay dead within the same, that she was constrained to cause all her gentlewomen to depart the chamber, only quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> that staied to beare her company: with that she threw her selfe on her bed, &amp; almost drowned in teares, began to make the greatest sorrow in the world. Quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> abashed at so suddain alteration, knew not what to think, but perceiuing her gréefe to increase still more &amp; more, went vnto her and said: Madame, I pray you hide y<SUP>e</SUP> cause of this sorrowe from me no longer, for I sweare vnto you of my faith, if by any means I may reléeue the same, I will deale ther∣in as for my selfe. <HI>Leonorine</HI> that neuer ceased sighing, could not answer her one word, but with much importance at the last an∣swered her and said: Alas my good friend, for Gods cause let me be in rest, and let it suffice you that you know, that I neuer was so desirous for to liue, as I am at this present to die. What Ma∣dame? (said the Quéene) will you tell me nothing els? No, (said shée.) In good faith then (said the Quéene) you shall do me wrong, and I shall haue good cause to thinke the loue and fauour that in times past you haue shewen vnto me, to bee altogither fained: whereat I am much gréeued, séeing I haue borne such a mind to you, that I would neuer haue failed to hazard not only my honor but my life and soule both for your sake. When the princes heard her speake with such affection, she was somwhat better assured, and thereupon said vnto her: Séeing you are so desirous to know the cause, you shall heare it presently, vpon condition you shall promise me to be a meanes rather to hinder my daies than any waies to further them, séeing I am fully determined to die. You may yet well remember (said she) the first time y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Carmelle</HI> came hither to bring vs newes of <HI>Esplandian,</HI> sonne to the good knight with the gréen Sword, that had commandement from his father (as she said) to come hither to serue vs in his place, according to
<PB REF="85"/> the promise he had made vnto vs being in this court: &amp; <HI>Carmelle</HI> said, that for that cause onely <HI>Esplandian</HI> had sent her vnto Con∣stantinople, to giue the Emperour and vs to vnderstand therof: but there were other matters in the wind, for shée came expresly to intreat me to be good vnto her master, who for the great loue and affection he bare vnto me, liued in the greatest paine that pos∣sible could be. Whereupon it happened, that being vanquished &amp; ouercome with an infinite number of reasons that she made vn∣to me, I confirmed in my heart, that which his renowme had al∣readie imprinted in my mind; and there with determined for to wish more good to him that to my selfe: not that I euer thought to commit any fault that might redound to my dishonour, but onely for the glory to haue so worthy a knight readie at my com∣mandement: whereby this fire did so augment in me, that euer since I could not thinke on any other thing that vpon <HI>Esplan∣dian,</HI> with whose loue my mind hath béene to mooued, that his long absence hath almost procured my death: yet the hope I had from day to day to sée him, hath made me able to sustaine my griefe with so great patience, that neither you nor any other, as I thinke, could euer perceiue it in me. But as the Saylor on the sea being in a tempest, thinking at length to arriue at some hauen for to saue himselfe, suddainly méeteth with a rocke that breaketh his shippe in péeces: so I (most vnfortunate Ladie) ho∣ping by the presence of him I so much desire to sée, to be at the end of my great sorrowe, am now fallen into the gulfe of despe∣ration, considering the spéech which <HI>Carmelle</HI> vsed to me, who speaking softly, saied in this manner: Madame I leaue you within this tombe two inestimable treasures: the one is the thing that in all the world you most desire to sée: which maketh me verily thinke it can be no other thing than the dead bodie of <HI>Esplandian,</HI> and that (as it is very likely) hée hath desired at his death to be brought vnto me to wéepe and lament ouer him, as I meane to doe during the terme of my life: which if it pleaseth God shall not be very long. And saying so shée cast forth a great sigh, sowning in Quéene <HI>Minoresses</HI> armes: who being abashed to hear the princesse vse those words so far from y<SUP>e</SUP> estimation she
<PB REF="86"/> alwaies had conceuied of her, knew not at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> what counsell or comfort to minister vnto her: neuertheles considering the ex∣tremitie shee was in, minding to prouide for two accidents that both at one instant presented themselues, she ranne in all hast to fetch cold water, which throwing in her face, she reuiued again. Where with the Quéene said vnto her, What Madame, wil you throw the helue after she hatchet? will you bée holden for a foole, and loose the reputation that is spread of you throughout y<SUP>e</SUP> world? Where is the constancie, the modestie, and the wisdome where∣with you were woont to be adorned? Must you for one word (which you misvnderstand) forget your selfe so much? Suppose it were true that <HI>Esplandian</HI> should be dead, can you call him againe by this tormenting your selfe? For Gods sake be patient, and if the worst be, you may prooue if it be so, and not fall into this kind of fantasie vpon your owne imaginations: <HI>Carmelle</HI> hath tolde you that the thing you most desire in all the worlde is inclosed in this tombe: is it therfore to be said <HI>Esplandian</HI> should not be aliue? Thinke you he is the first man that hath done the like for his be∣loueds sake? This I assure you, that although I breake y<SUP>e</SUP> tombe and all that belongeth to it, I will presently sée what may bée in it. Alas cousin (said the Princes) I feare you will sée it ouer soone for me, for if he be dead (as I thinke he is) assure your selfe I will beare him companie before it be day. I pray you (said the quéene) be not vnhappy before your time, but let me worke the feat: hold then (said <HI>Leonorine</HI>) here is the keye y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Carmelle</HI> left me: which the Quéene tooke in her hand, and entring into the chāber where the tomb stood, she lifted vp the christall plate; that done, she spake aloud, and asked if any bodie were within the same: <HI>Esplandian</HI> (to whom one houre séemed a whole yéere) staying for that time, and hearing the Quéene speake, answered presently, and said: I Madame. Who are you? (said <HI>Minoresse.</HI>) Madame, said he, I am the happy or vnhappy knight <HI>Esplandian,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> put my selfe into this tombe, ready to receiue either death or life, as it shall please the princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> to dispose. Are you (said the Quéene) <HI>Es∣plandian,</HI> sonne to the good knight with the Gréene Sword, that by messages hath so often times promised to come and serue vs?
<PB REF="86"/> I madame (said hée) and that to accomplish my word, haue caused my selfe to be brought hether in this manner. If you wil promise me (said the Quéene) and sweare not to passe my commandement in that I shall appoint you to doe, I will cause you both to sée and speake to her you desire so much to serue? That will I promise you, (said he) and a greater matter likewise, so my lady be contēt. It is inough (saied the Quéene) wherewith shee lifted vp the se∣cond plate, and then opened y<SUP>e</SUP> chest where in he lay, and comming out he vsed great reuerence to the Quéene, but as then he knew her not, till she saied vnto him: Sir Knight, it may bee you haue heard of mée before this time, I am <HI>Minoresse,</HI> that to deliuer my Lady and you from the great paine you both indure, hath taken you out of this your prison: Wherefore I pray you stay here a while, till I returne againe. With that she went vnto the Prin∣cesse <HI>Leonorine</HI> (that meane time for feare shooke like an aspen leafe:) and with a merry countenance saied vnto her: Madame, when wee haue a long and hard Winter, it is commonly séene there followeth a pleasant Summer: and after great sorow com∣meth excéeding ioy. You haue be wailed your knight <HI>Esplandian</HI> for dead, but neuer in all my life haue I séene a dead creature bu∣ried that was so faire, and of so pleasant countenance, as the dead man I haue found within the tombe: I pray you come and sée it I be deceaued or not. When the Princesse heard the Quéene vse those words touching <HI>Esplandian,</HI> and to laugh withall with ioie, her heart leaped in her body, and rising out of her bed, without speaking any word, she ranne presently into the chamber, at the entery whereof, shee espied him shee had so much lamented: who presently knéeled downe to kisse her hands. But <HI>Leonorine</HI> was not as then disposed to vse ceremonies, but forgetting her accu∣stomed modestie, and the grauitie required in her sexe, especially the shamefastnesse that commonly is séene to be in wise and ver∣tuous Ladies, could not so much command her owne affections, but cast her selfe into <HI>Esplandians</HI> arms, kissing him wiih so great affection, as if shee had séene, loued, and knowne him all her life time. And assure your selfe, if Quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> had not drawne her backe, and reprooued her lightnesse, that at that instant those
<PB REF="87"/> two louers had died in the place, for that both their spirits had a∣bandoned all their vitall parts to méet together at their mouths, &amp; to imbrace each other, euen to the extremity of their lips, ready to passe further. I say not but y<SUP>e</SUP> Quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> did thē wrong: and likewise, if any man would accuse <HI>Leonorine</HI> of folly or in∣constancy, I answere him againe that she is most easily to be ex∣cused both of the one and the other, for although shee had neuer séene <HI>Esplandian</HI> before that time, &amp; that in reason she should haue known him better before she shewed her selfe so priuat vnto him, you must suppose (as it is trew) that loue had of long time before so well ingrauen him in her mind, y<SUP>t</SUP> she seased not to sée him eue∣ry day with her inward eies. And as nature had studied to make her most perfect in all perfections whatsoeuer, loue had likewise taken pleasure to make her the best beloued and y<SUP>e</SUP> truest louer y<SUP>t</SUP> euer was before her time. Wherefore it is not to be maruelled, if at the first shee shewed so good a countenance to her friend, consi∣dring y<SUP>e</SUP> pain &amp; great gréefe she had indured since y<SUP>e</SUP> time <HI>Carmelle</HI> brought hir news. These two louers being thus before each other (<HI>Esplandiā</HI> stil knéeling) séemed to be so rauished y<SUP>e</SUP> quéen <HI>Minoresse</HI> could not refrain to say to <HI>Leonorine:</HI> Madame, me thinketh you should doe well to commaund the knight to rise vp &amp; lead him into your chamber, where you may talk together while y<SUP>e</SUP> night indu∣reth, if you think géed: but to let him knéele still on the ground, in good faith it is not wel. My good friend (said <HI>Leonorine</HI>) he hath fled from vs for almost two years together, now I mean to kéep him so néer me, y<SUP>t</SUP> he shall not easily escape away: with that shée tooke him by the hand to lift him vp, but hée would not stir but said vnto her: Madame, <HI>Gastilles</HI> not long since sent me word being at Al∣farin, that you were much offended with me, I pray you shew me the cause: for if I euer cōmitted fault against you, it hath ben only in louing you with all my heart, as I am bound to do. Neuerthe∣lesse, if in your aduise I séem to haue presumed ouermuch, pardon me I pray you, &amp; giue me what punishment you shal thinke good. My friend (said she) your absence hath procured me so great cause of gréefe, y<SUP>t</SUP> I both pray you &amp; command you, from henceforth not to absent your self from me long again. Madame (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>)
<PB REF="87"/> hauing (with your leaue) made another voiage to my compani∣ons, that may thinke ill of me, leauing them in their chéefest néed to come hether for my pleasure: I sweare vnto you of my faith I will neuer offend you more in y<SUP>e</SUP> manner, or any other way what∣soeuer. I am content to graunt you that (saied she) so you returne as soon as possible you may: and for the rest I wil y<SUP>t</SUP> from hence∣forth you loue me in such sort, that not any other but my self shall haue power ouer you, &amp; that you be my knight: Now I pray you stand vp, &amp; I will shewe you further of my mind. With y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> rose vp, and <HI>Leonorine</HI> taking him by the right hand, led him into her chamber, where she set him a chaire, and shée sat by him, there they began to shewe the paines each of them had indured, in what manner their loue did first begin, who was the meane thereof, and the end wherevnto they pretended, which was their future marriage. In which discourse, they grew into such altera∣tions, that if quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> had not béene there as witnesse to their talke, considering the heat they then were in, I thinke not, but in time they would haue easily procéeded to a further matter. In that manner the two louers passed the night till day began to appeare: which quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> perceiuing, went to <HI>Leonorine</HI> and said vnto her: Madame, the secretest follies are alwaies best, it is almost day, and it may bee the Empresse may send some one of her women, or come her selfe in person to visit you, for that ye∣sternight very late it was told her you were not wel. I pray you giue this knight leaue to depart, and let vs shut him in the chest, as wee found him at the first. Alas how hard were those wordes vnto <HI>Esplandian,</HI> and no lesse vnto the Princesse, who foreséeing the daunger that might fall out if they were found together, said vnto him: My good friend, this happy night that hath fauou∣red vs so much, shall cause you if you thinke good, to remember the promise you haue made vnto mee: I pray you let mée sée you againe as soone as possible you may. And as shee ended those words, the quéene y<SUP>t</SUP> stood as a stout watch, heard some body come vp y<SUP>e</SUP> staires, wherwith being in great fear, she told y<SUP>e</SUP> princes <HI>Le∣onorine,</HI> which made <HI>Esplandian</HI> presētly go into y<SUP>e</SUP> other chamber, &amp; without hauing time to take any longer farewell, laid himselfe
<PB REF="88"/> downe into the Ceader chest, yet <HI>Leonorine</HI> could not abstaine, but must of force kisse him before hée was shut in, and as they had laied the christall plate vpon the tombe, <HI>Carmelle</HI> knocked at the dore, and with her <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil,</HI> and the rest of the company that the night bafore had brought him thether. With that quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> opened the do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and they entering into the chamber, <HI>Carmelle</HI> saw <HI>Leonorine</HI> that came vnto her, to whome after shee had done her reuerence, she saied: Madame, I am commanded by him that sent me vnto you, not to stay any longer here, is it not your pleasure to giue me leaue to depart, and cause the chest to be deliuered vnto mee, according to your promise? Gentlewoman (said the Princesse) I haue made you promise thereof, and I will kéepe it, although I had rather it should stay together as it is, then to seperate it a sunder. Take it when you will, you shal find it in y<SUP>e</SUP> same place where yester night you caused it to be set: with that the Ladies and gentlewomen being aduertised of her rising, came into her chamber, which hindered <HI>Leonorine</HI> to speak so se∣cretly with <HI>Carmelle</HI> as she would haue done, but onely gaue her the key of the chest, which she caused to be takē out of the tombe: that done, <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil,</HI> and the two squires, tooke it vp be∣twéene them and carried it away, <HI>Leonorine</HI> saying to <HI>Carmelle:</HI> I pray you thanke the knight (in my behalfe) that hath had mee in so good remembrance. And find the meanes, if it be possible that (according to the promise and messages hee hath often sent vnto the Emperour, part where of haue ben done by your selfe) he will as soone as he can, come he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her to sée vs. Madame (said she) I will doe it with all my heart, as she that desireth to please, serue and o∣bay you. Faile not then (said the Princesse) and so God haue you in his kéeping. That done, <HI>Carmelle</HI> followed them that carried <HI>Esplandian,</HI> leauing <HI>Leonorine</HI> accompanied both with ioy &amp; sad∣nesse: with ioy, to haue séene him that shee helde dearer then her selfe, and with sadnesse, for his so suddaine departure. But the hope shee had of his spéedy returne, eased her gréefe much. <HI>Car∣melle</HI> hauing brought hir purpose to passe as you heard before, de∣siring not to omit any thing that séemed necessary to be done: and to auoid all suspition, sent <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> before vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> ships,
<PB REF="88"/> and went vnto the Emperour, whome she found walking in the gallery, who no sooner perceiued her, but hée asked if the Present that <HI>Esplandian</HI> sent vnto his daughter, were yet in her ship. No my lord, (saied she) I caused it yesternight to bee carried into her chamber as I promised you, and haue left it all with her, onely that which was giuen me for my part. What was that? (saide the Emperour.) The Ceader chest: (said she) wherein (if it plea∣seth God) I will cause the body of <HI>Matroco</HI> to bee buried, that as yet lieth in my fathers Hermitage. But my lord, because as this morning I determined to sayle vnto the castle <HI>La montaigne de∣fendu,</HI> to him that sent mee hether, I pray you giue me leaue to depart. Gentlewoman (said the Emperour) when you were last here, I sent him word by you, what ioy &amp; great pleasure it would be vnto me for to sée him here, I pray you once againe shewe him what I said: Assuring him, that being here, hee shall haue of mee all honour and good entertainement we can deuise. My lord (said <HI>Carmelle</HI>) God preserue your grace and send you life: And there∣with taking her leaue, she returned into her ship, where <HI>Esplandi∣an</HI> and his company staied for her.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII. How Esplandian put to sea, thinking to arriue at the castle La mon∣taigne defendu, and of the great aduentures he found.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>Splandian</HI> entered into his shippe, and <HI>Carmelle</HI> being returned as it is saied before, they determined not to stay longer, fearing to be discouered: wher∣fore they caused ankers to be hoised, &amp; setting saile, made towards the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> but fortune by a great storme and contrary wind ca∣ried them another way, driuing them along the coast of Alfarin, where the wind ceased, they sayling almost hard by the shore, and at the same instant whē they espied
<PB REF="89"/> among the rockes certaine horse and footmen fighting together: whereat <HI>Esplandian</HI> maruelled, and said vnto <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil:</HI> I pray you, séeing wée are arriued here at this instant, let vs goe sée from whence the occasion of their combate procéedeth, and if we may, helpe them that haue the iustest quarrel. Let vs go (said the two knights) wherwith they presently landed, and mounting on their horses, commaunded the saylers to stay for them, and in great hast ranne vnto the place where the combate was, and ap∣proching the same, they knewe their companions by the white crosses they bare vpon their armour, and séeing them in danger, and inclosed on all sides by great number of Turkes, <HI>Esplandian</HI> spurred his horse ouer the stones, and entered into the prease, but not very farre, by reason the Turkes kept a strait place, where he must passe, from whence at the first hée was repulsed: Neuer∣thelesse in y<SUP>e</SUP> end <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> seconded him so well with the helpe of those that fought on the other side, that notwithstanding the great resistance the Turkes made, they inclosed them on all sides, and beat them downe: yet some of them by the swiftnesse of their horses saued themselues, whereby the Christians remained victors, not losing one man. The knights that had beene aided in y<SUP>e</SUP> manner, could not imagine which way the other thrée knights came: but when they knew them, neuer were men gladder, prai∣sing God of his great mercy shewed vnto thē. Wherwith <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> asked them how they came thether: My lord (saied <HI>Elianle delibere,</HI>) I and my companions had so much intreated <HI>Belleris</HI> to lead vs into the country, y<SUP>t</SUP> all this night he hath ben our guide: we being issued out of Alfarin, thinking to surprise the towne of Galatia that lieth vpon the sea side not far from hence, and to the same end wée staied in ambush, but perceiuing our enterprise to bée discouered, and thinking by little and little to retire, we were inclosed in such maner y<SUP>t</SUP> if God had not holpē vs by your means, without doubt wee had all béene ouerthrowne and destroied. By the faith of a knight (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) if you had considered the countrey where wee are, and that the losse of one of our men is greater to vs then a thousand others, if we were in Christen∣dome, you would not haue hazarded your selues so much: but
<PB REF="89"/> what is past, cannot bee vndone. And to the end wee spéedend worse, let vs enter into my shippe that stayeth for mee. My lord <HI>Esplandian</HI> (saied <HI>Belleris</HI>) Occasion is offered now vnto vs, and let him goe that refuseth it, when time serueth. You sée the ouerthrow of the Turkes, which is such, that I certainely beléeue, there is not one man left within the Towne. Where∣fore I am of opinion, that wee ride thether in as secret manner as wee may, then if wee sée occasion, wee will set vpon the gates, and it may bee shall enter the Towne without resistance, meane time send one of your Squires to certefie your saylers, that they saile vnto Alfarin, or else that they stirre not from thence before they heare newes of vs. This counsell liked them well, and they all agréed vnto it: with that <HI>Belleris</HI> mar∣ched on before, <HI>Esplandian</HI> and the rest following after, ri∣ding close together vpon a Causie, where not farre from thence they espied one sitting vpon a sharpe rocke most hideous to beholde, whereat they spurred their horses thether to sée what it might bee, where they sawe a woman so olde, impotent, and withered, that her breastes hung downe beneath her nauill, apparrelled in a Beares skinne, whereon hung her long, white, and knotted haire, where shee had liued a∣mong those rockes in all tempests and stormye weathers for the space of sixescore yeares together. By which meanes, her naked bodie shewed like the barke of an Elme trée or some an∣cient Oke, whereby not one of them but began to laugh, as∣king <HI>Belleris</HI> if hee had heard of her before. I truly (saied he) for shee is so neare of linage to king <HI>Armato,</HI> that shee was his great Grandfathers sister. And although that in her yong yeares shee hath béene indued with all the gifts of nature, yet would shee neuer marry, what meanes soeuer her friendes could vse, but gaue her selfe continually to studie the Art of Magicke, in such sort, that none could surpasse her in the same, whereby shee hath foreshowne long time since, that before shee died, the lande of Turkye should bee ouer∣throwne, and brought in subiection vnto straungers. And for this cause thee hath caused this Rocke to bee hewen,
<PB REF="90"/> wherein she hath made two chambers, where continually she a∣bideth, apparrelled in the same manner you now behold her, and as it is commonly reported, she is very neare ninescore yeares of age, and that you may know her better, it is shee that caused the gilt pillers with the Tables hanging at them, to bée set vp at the aduenturous fountaine, which you my lord <HI>Esplandian</HI> (saied hee) might peraduenture sée, when you found the Princesse <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> and ouerthrew her guard in that place. Truly (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) I would gladly know how she passeth the time, being so solitarie as she is. My lord (said <HI>Belleris</HI>) that could neuer be knowne, yet it is thought, that shee hath carried great number of bookes into the caue, wherwith she delighteth her self. I maruell (said <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI>) why no man euer aduentured to goe into the rocke? so they haue done: (saied <HI>Belleris</HI>) but they returned againe so well bea∣ten and cruelly handeled, that at their comming foorth, some of them died. Let vs speake vnto her (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) and it may bée shee will tell vs no goodnesse: wherewith they went néerer vnto her, but she presently rose vp and fled into her caue, at the entery whereof shee stayed, saying to <HI>Esplandian:</HI> Knight, Aboue a hun∣dred years before thou wast borne, I did foreshew the destruction of this countrey by thy arriuall here, therefore I chuse rather to lead this miserable and cruell life, then to fall into thy hands, and liue in miserable captiuity. With that she went in, and could no more bee séene, wherat they all began to laugh, and without lon∣ger staying went on their way, wherein they perceiued cōming towards them about sixty or fourescore knights, all armed ready to fight: wherevpon doubting them to be enemies, they stood stil, causing <HI>Enil</HI> and <HI>Belleris</HI> to ride forwards to know the truth, who crossing the field, and staying vnder a touffe of corke, they percei∣ued one of the company to bear a red ancient with a white crosse, &amp; therwith they knew <HI>Frandalo</HI> that marched before them, wher∣vpon they returned to their cōpanions? who glad of those news, went to méet thē, &amp; comming in sight each of other, <HI>Frandalo</HI> thin∣king to be surprised, willed his companions to stand close, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> bet∣ter to prouoke his enemies to fight, he sent two or thrée of the best horses in his company to skirmish with thē, but they perceauing

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Christian knights being met togither, <HI>Esplandian</HI> asked <HI>Frandalo</HI> wherefore hée rode abroad with so great a company: My lord, said he, this morning I was aduerti∣sed, that <HI>Belleris</HI> my nephew had issued by night out of Alfarin w<SUP>t</SUP> certaine knightes, to sée if they could méet with our enemies, and fearing they should find some ambush laid for them that would be stronger than themselues, I told my lord <HI>Norandel</HI> your vncle, by whose aduise we tooke this way to followe him, but for that neither we nor you haue met with any company to prouoke vs to fight, I pray you let vs returne again the best way we can vnto Alfarin: but you my lord said he, what aduenture hath brought you hither in so good time to find vs here? What aduenture? (said he) Truly you may well tearme it so: for <HI>Gandalin, Enil,</HI> and I, thinking to saile vnto the castle <HI>La mon∣taigne defendu,</HI> fortune by tempest of weather, draue our shippe so néere this coast, that wée might plainly behold <HI>Belleris</HI> and his companie fighting against a great number of the enemie, that had driuen them among the rockes: whereupon we landed, and entred so farre among the enemies, that in the end the victorie was ours: after that by your nephewes counsell wee were ri∣ding towardes Galatie, the which (as he assureth vs) will bée easily gotten without great resistāce, considering the ouerthrow
<PB REF="91"/> wée haue alreadie giuen them. Truly (said <HI>Frandalo</HI>) it may well be so, and séeing fortune most commonly aideth all hardy aduen∣turers, let vs goe forward, and follow me, for I knowe a way whereby I will bring you thither without being discouered. Let vs goe (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) and with that they followed <HI>Frandalo</HI> that went softly before them, till they came vnto a litle hill with∣in a mile of Galatie, from whence they might easily perceiue who issued or entred the towne: where they beheld great num∣bers of men as well horsemen as footmen, who being aduertised of the ouerthrow of their men, went to succour them, thinking to find the christians in the place where they had fought, but they were behind them: which the two knights (they had sent out to discouer) perceiuing, ranne to aduertise <HI>Frandalo</HI> and his com∣pany, who being glad of the newes, went forward in great hast, and suddainly set vpon the gates, where slaying the watch, they entred and tooke the towne, wherein there were none but impo∣tent and weake people to defend the same: which done, they drewe the Bridges, and went vpon the walles to kéepe watch, and to behold the enemies countenance at their returne, when they vnderstood thereof, which was not long after, for a country man leaping ouer the walles, ranne presently to aduertise them. If they were sorry it is not to be doubted, for that besides the losse of their goods, they lost their wiues and children, thinking they should all be sent prisoners into a strange countrey, whereat they were much gréeued: but one Knight among the rest béeing a man of some stomacke, perceiuing their sorrowe, badde them be of good courage, animating them in such sort, that they all determined either to loose their liues or els to winne the towne againe: and therevpon (more mooued with rage than with rea∣son) they returned to the towne, and assailed it in such furious and indiscrete manner, that a great part of them lost their liues in the assault, béeing repulsed and driuen away by <HI>Frandalo, Es∣plandian, Enil, Gandalin, Elian, Tiron,</HI> and tenne other of the most principall Christian knights: who to encrease more feare in the Galatians, issued out of the towne and slewe a great
<PB REF="91"/> number of them: but as a Cat that is inclosed and assailed (be∣fore shée beginneth to defend her selfe) séeketh by all meanes to shunne and auoid the furie of the man, and finding her selfe out of her hole, and no meanes of succour left her, becommeth so furious and bolde, that shée beginneth to assaile him, from whome shée first fledde away, and often times doth him mis∣chiefe: So these poore people, séeing nothing but present death before their eyes, by reason of the chase that the tenne Christian Knightes made after them, béeing wholly desperate and out of all hope of obtaining mercie, beganne to take courage againe, and in such sort, that desiring to reuenge their liues, they turned their faces towards the enemie with such courage, that ha∣uing set vpon the Christians, in the end <HI>Frandalo</HI> was stricken downe, <HI>Esplandian</HI> and the rest béeing enclosed in such manner, that they had all lost their liues in that place, had they not béene aided of their companions, and night that came vpon them: which was the cause they left each other: whereupon the Christians returned into the towne, and the Turkes rode to∣wards Tesifante to the Prince <HI>Alphorax,</HI> who béeing aduerti∣sed of their misfortune, to comfort them, spake vnto them and said: My friends, I am not a little sorrie for your losses, where∣vnto (if our gods permit vs) I will take such order, and be re∣uenged in such sort, that it shall be spoken of so long as the worlde endureth. For I hope not onely to driue these théeues out of my countrey, but to goe in person to spoyle and vtterly de∣stroy the cittie of Constantinople, with his wicked and accur∣sed Emperour, and all the Christian Monarchie. Which to bring to passe, it is not long since I sent my Ambassadours vnto my friends and allies, who haue all giuen mée their promise to ayde and succour mée with their forces and powers, whereof some are alreadie arriued at Tenedo, where wée (vpon certaine matters touching our countries) are to assemble togither: and staying the time till I haue meanes to doe better for you, I will giue order that certaine mony shall be giuen you to sustain your wants: For the which the citizens of Galatia thanking him most
<PB REF="92"/> heartily, remaining in Tesifant, where they continually lamen∣ted their great losses: on the other side <HI>Esplandian, Frandalo,</HI> and the rest of the knightes that had gotten the towne, considering with themselues, that it would be impossible for them to kéepe &amp; defend so many places with so fewe men, agréed among them to send <HI>Gandalin</HI> to Constantinople vnto the Emperour, to shew him what they had of late done to <HI>Alphorax,</HI> and woon the towne of Galatie, being one of y<SUP>e</SUP> most famous hauens in all those parts, and for that cause besought him to send them. <HI>Gastilles</HI> or some other of his captaines, with some forces to aid them: otherwise they should be constrained either to leaue Galatie or els Alfarin, considering their small number and the continuall alarmes that the enemies gaue them, and the better to mooue him thereunto, they sent him the greatest part of the rich iewels they had con∣quered in the towne. But they had neither Barke nor Pinnace ready to send, wherefore they were constrained to take y<SUP>t</SUP> where∣in <HI>Esplandian</HI> came thither: which at that time (as fortune would) lay still at anker staying their pleasure. Wherewith <HI>Esplandian</HI> sent <HI>Sergil</HI> to cause the ship to come thither: which done, &amp; <HI>Gan∣dalin</HI> ready to imbarke himselfe, <HI>Esplandian</HI> tooke him aside, &amp; said vnto him: Friend <HI>Gandalin,</HI> you haue alwaies béene faithfull &amp; trustie to my father, which giueth me cause to disclose my secret vnto you before all others. When you come to Constantinople (said hee) you shall sée the Lady <HI>Leonorine,</HI> to whome you shall present my most humble commendations, shewing her, that I will not faile very shortly to accomplish my promise and her cō∣mandement, and withall you shall present her the two slaues that were giuen me, which I send to wait vpon her, that by their presence she may haue me in remembrance: and knowing you are not to learne how to vse your spéeches in such cases, I pray you <HI>Gandalin</HI> let me find in you that which I expect. My Lord (said he) God giue me grace to doe you seruice. Then fare you well (said <HI>Esplandian.</HI>) With that <HI>Gandalin</HI> with all his charge entred into the ship, and hauing set saile, had a good wind, that in short time after he arriued in Constantinople: where being lan∣ded, he caused two squires to beare the presents he had brought;
<PB REF="92"/> and entring into the palace, he found the Emperor talking with diuers of his Noble men: the Emperor perceiuing him, went to imbrace him, asking him where he had left the good knight <HI>Esplan∣dian,</HI> and whether he meant not shortly to come and sée him. My Lord, said <HI>Gandalin,</HI> he commendeth himselfe most humbly vnto your Grace, and hath sent you word by me, that not aboue fiftéen daies past, hée, <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and others of our companie haue taken the towne of Galatie. Galatie? (said the Emperor) By y<SUP>e</SUP> faith I beare to God, that is good newes: for as I haue béen informed heretofore, it is one of the richest townes in all Turkie, but I know not well how they can kéepe it. Full well my lord (said <HI>Gandalin</HI>) so it be your pleasure to send them some aid: otherwise they shall bee constrained in the end, either to abandon that to kéepe Alfarin, or Alfarin for that: which would bée a shame for them, and great dommage both to your Grace and all Christen∣dome. Haue they found great riches therein (said the Emperor) or haue they lost any quantity of their men? My lord (said <HI>Gan∣dalin</HI>) some of the enemies were slaine in the taking thereof: and with that he began to shew him the maner how it was done, and causing the cases wherein the presents were, to be opened, amōg other things he shewed him the images of <HI>Nabuchodonosot</HI> king of Assiria, of <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, and that which he most estée∣med, the true and liuely representation of <HI>Hector</HI> of Troy, ar∣med at all points, as he was when he fought against the Greci∣ans: and surely the Emperour had reason to make so much ac∣count thereof, for that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> was content to receiue it for his part, as being estéemed to be the richest iewell in all the citty of Troy, for that <HI>Hector</HI> himselfe had caused it purposely to bée made while the Grecians lay before the citie, by one of the cun∣ningest workemen that could be found, and set it vpon the chiefe gate of the palace of Ilion, which long time after fell into the hands of the kings of Turkie, that had erected it in the market place of Galatie, placing it vpon a high marble pillar, which <HI>Gandalin</HI> shewed vnto the Emperour, as he hard reported in the country: wherewith the Emperour was so well pleased, that hée could not refraine to say: In good truth I should not be better
<PB REF="93"/> pleased with the taking of the Citty of Tesifante, then I am at this time with this goodly Present, and I pray you tell y<SUP>e</SUP> knights that sent it, y<SUP>t</SUP> I thanke them for it with al my heart. My lord (said <HI>Gandalin</HI>) so they did thinke it would bée more acceptable vnto your grace thē all the vessels of gold and siluer y<SUP>t</SUP> they found with∣in the Towne, part whereof they haue likewise sent vnto you, that are in this other case, which hée presently caused to bée ope∣ned, and after they had perused them, <HI>Gandalin</HI> caused the two slaues that <HI>Esplandian</HI> sent, to come néerer, presenting them to the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> saying vnto her: Madame, the good knight <HI>Esplandian</HI> not knowing what greater Present to offer you (next vnto himselfe) then these two yong maids, hée sendeth them vnto you as your slaues, to the end euery man may know, that as you are the goodliest lady that euer nature framed, so is there not any creature liuing on the earth, that better deserueth to commaund such as command others, then your selfe: wherefore if you shew him the courtesie to accept them at his hands, hee will estéeme it for one of the greatest fauours that euer hee receaued. <HI>Leonorine</HI> that knew as well how to dissemble her affections as any womā liuing on the earth: And desiring to haue the same opinion, that alwaies had run of her, to continue still, with a dissembled kinde of anger, answered <HI>Gandalin</HI> and said: Sir knight, it séemeth by your words, that <HI>Esplandian</HI> is disposed to mock me, and that you estéeme me to be a woman of light credite, could you of your faith thinke me so very a child, that I should not well perceaue, (that if <HI>Esplandian</HI> were so much at my commaundement as you say) hee would not haue deferred the time so long to come hether vnto vs, were it only but to acquite the promise king <HI>Amadis</HI> his Father made vs aboue sixe or seuen yeares past. But I knowe his mind full well, hée meanes to content vs with wordes, and many messages that from time to time hée sendeth, together with an infinite number of excuses, but all to no purpose, wher∣of while I liue I will not accept one of them for his discharge: let him therefore come himselfe, and then it may bee I will be∣léeue that to bée in him, I haue so oftentimes heard reported. When the Emperour heard her speake in that sort, hee showed
<PB REF="93"/> by his countenaunce that hée tooke great pleasure at his dough∣ters choler, and saied vnto her: My swéet friend, what wil <HI>Gan∣dalin</HI> say to sée you so vncourteous towards him, that honoureth you so much: I pray you swéet heart moderate your colour, and take that hée sendeth, for if you refuse it, hée shall haue great oc∣casion to dislike thereof: And you sée that for your sake hee dooth so many valiant acts, that the good knight with the Gréene sword could neuer doe the like. My lord (saied shee) I beléeue for valour hée is not inferiour vnto his father, but for courtesie his father surpasseth him. In faith Madame (saied <HI>Gandalin</HI>) if you knew him as well as I doe, it may bée you would commend him more then now you blaspheame him, séeing that if hee hath deferred the time to come hether, it is onely because hee thin∣keth hée hath not as yet done sufficient in armes, whereby hee should deserue one sparke of fauour at your handes, considering your estate and the small valour that is in him, although at this day hée is estéemed the best knight that euer bare armes for these hundred yeares. Neuerthelesse, séeing you accuse him of that, that ought most to excuse him, I promise you of mine honor, lea∣uing all thinges apart, presently vpon my retourne hee shall come hether vnto you, to doe whatsoeuer it shall please you to commaund him. <HI>Gandalin</HI> (saied the Princesse <HI>Leonorine</HI>) thinke not (whatsoeuer I say) that I either take pleasure or displeasure at his presence or his absence, but onely as my Father dooth, and I for his sake, knowing the great loue and affection hée hath alwayes born to King <HI>Amadis</HI> his Father, and continueth the same to his sonne. But hereof am I well assu∣red, that hée cannot so excuse himselfe, or make vs thinke o∣ther, then that herein hée hath done vs wrong. Neuerthelesse, séeing it is the Emperours pleasure, I will kéepe the Present hée hath sent mée, vppon the promise and assurance you haue made of his comming hether as soone as you shall bee arriued at Galatia. Truely <HI>Leonorine</HI> played her part, very cunningly herein: for hardly would it haue béen thought or once imagined, that <HI>Esplandian</HI> and shee had so faithfully giuen their handes and harts as they had done in the presence of quéene <HI>Minoresse,</HI> as you
<PB REF="94"/> heard before, and <HI>Gandalin</HI> for his part knew not what to think, although he had borne <HI>Esplandian</HI> in the tombe, and set him in hir chamber as you likewise heard. Then the Emperour asked him how long hée meant to stay. My lord (said <HI>Gandalin</HI>) as little as I may, for it were not fit for me to line at rest, while my cōpanions are in armes: Wherefore I most humbly beséech your grace to giue mée my dispatch as soone as possible you can. <HI>Gandalin,</HI> (saied the Emperour) I will presently send for my admirall, &amp; wil cause men in al hast to be prepared, that within sixe or seuen daies they shall bée ready to depart. With that hee went into the Garden to recreate himselfe, and the Ladies with him: where when <HI>Gan∣dalin</HI> perceiued <HI>Leonorine</HI> in an herbor of Mirtle trées, walking pensiuely alone, hee went vnto her and saied: Madame, my lord <HI>Esplandian</HI> commanded mee to certefie your grace, that since the time hee departed from you, and that he receiued so great fauour at your handes, his heart (that wholly is yours) hath so longed after you, that hee hath thought to die a thousand times with gréefe, for the losse of your presence. And to say the truth, I haue knowne many men troubled with the passions of loue: but I certainely beléeue there was neuer his like, nor that more wise∣ly could dissemble it, which maketh mee greatly to doubt his person. For that it is impossible, considering the gréefe hee still indureth, together with the small comfort hee receiueth of his familiar friends, (not knowing his disease) but that hee must in short time end his daies: whereby great dommage should then arise vnto all Christendome, considering the straunge be∣ginning of Knighthoode and great Prowesse that is in him: which is such, as that if hee continue as hee hath begun, he will bring that order in greater estimation then euer it hath béene before: wherefore Madame, séeing I haue alwaies (as it may bee you are alreadie aduertised) beene a seruaunt to his father, and that I am acquainted with the nature of his sonne, and the daunger wherein hee is like to fall into, if you shewe him not some fauour, I haue presumed to shewe your Ladyship the hard case wherein he was when I left him, as also that hee hath expressely commaunded mee to asure you,
<PB REF="94"/> that his only intent and desire is to be in your presence. Yet per∣ceiuing the danger wherin his companions do remain, he know∣eth not what excuse to make, whereby he might take occasion for to leaue them: wherfore he be séecheth you to impute his long ab∣sence vnto fortune, and not to him that is born only to loue, serue, and obay you. In vttering whereof <HI>Gandalin</HI> shewed so sorrow∣full a countenance, that hee made <HI>Leonorine</HI> ready to wéepe, In which kind of office hee had so well ben exercised from his youth, that no man could surpasse him in the same. Friend <HI>Gandalin</HI> (said y<SUP>e</SUP> princesse <HI>Leonorine</HI>) I know not what you mean I should do for him more then already I haue done, nor yet for what cause you should imagine that I séeke to be the means of his death: sée∣ing that if he were but sick, I know my selfe so féeble and impati∣ent, that with gréefe &amp; sorow I should not be able to liue one hour after. Let it therfore be far from you, once to thinke that I would euer be any other mans then only his: and think it not strange, if in the Emperors presence, or before the world, I dissemble as I do, for I would not in any case, that the least inckling of the bur∣ning loue wherein my heart continually flameth towards him, should as yet bee once perceiued, chéefly for the great good I wish vnto him. Madame (said <HI>Gandalin</HI>) I am well assured hee will re∣ceiue an extream pleasure to hear these newes, and y<SUP>t</SUP> he wil leaue all things to come hether, if you thinke it good. That is my desire (said she) and I pray him so to do, and you to persuade him there∣vnto. While they were deuising, <HI>Tartarie</HI> the admiral (so called of the place of his birth) entred into y<SUP>e</SUP> garden: being a man issued of a mean house, but aduanced vnto great authority by his great wit &amp; valiant courage, so that he commanded ouer all y<SUP>e</SUP> Grecian seas. The Emperor and hée talked long time touching <HI>Gandalins</HI> message, concerning aid to bee sent vnto Galatia, and in the end he willed in all hast to prepare thirty gallies &amp; Foistes, with two thousand of the best souldiers he could find to man the same. The admirall <HI>Tartary</HI> according to his charge, executed his commissi∣on in such sort, that within sixe daies after he was ready with his nauie to set saile, and depart from thence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX. How Vrganda arriued at Galatia, and of the danger wherein shee was by the subtletie of Melie the Enchauntresse.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He admirall <HI>Tartarie</HI> and <HI>Gandalin</HI> ha∣uing taken their leaues of the Emperor, set saile, and passed the straights of Con∣stantinople, and without any aduentures, arriued at Galatia within one wéek after their departure: if they were wel receiued by the Christian knights, it is not to be doubted, for their number was so small and so dispersed, that they were in doubt to bee able to kéepe that Towne, with Alfarin, and the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu.</HI> But when they saw such aid, they were in better hope, and hauing re∣ceaued the admirall, they deuided their two thousand men, as néed required. Mean time <HI>Esplandian</HI> had no small desire to know of <HI>Gandalin</HI> if he had spoken with the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> &amp; how she did: for the which cause being in his chamber, hée sent for him. Where talking together, <HI>Gandalin</HI> shewed him from point to point what spéeches had passed betwéene the Princesse and him, not only before the Emperour, but also in the garden. And of my faith sir (saied hée) you do her wrong, considering the good meanes you haue both to satisfie her and your self: for what excuse soeuer you can make, you are not so sore charged on this side, that you may not spare some time to goe and sée her, which shee craueth at your hands. That I wil doe (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) but I must find the meanes; take you care for y<SUP>t</SUP> (said <HI>Gandalin</HI>) and let me go sléepe, for I neuer had more néed: Goe (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) &amp; be here again betimes in the morning. Wherewith <HI>Gandalin</HI> tooke his leaue, leauing <HI>Esplandian</HI> alone in great care how hee might find some conuenient excuse to leaue his companions in y<SUP>e</SUP> extreamity, but God prouided for him: for y<SUP>e</SUP> same night about an hour before day as he began to slumber, he heard a most pleasant sound of musick,
<PB REF="95"/> which you must vnderstand, came out of the great serpent y<SUP>t</SUP> hee left in the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> which at y<SUP>e</SUP> time was arri∣ued before the town of Galatia, but little did he thinke of any such thing, or y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Vrganda</HI> had ben therein, because he thought her to bée in great Brittaine. This mellody continued for the space of half an houre and more, which done, he heard such a noise of trumpets Clarigals, Phifes, and Tabers, y<SUP>t</SUP> sounded so high, y<SUP>t</SUP> the sentinels of the town thought verily the enemies nauy had ben arriued be∣fore the same to lay siege vnto it: wherevpon they caused an ala∣rum in the town, each man running to the wals, being all of that mind till day, when they might be hold the great serpent (wherein <HI>Vrganda</HI> was) all hung with long pennons and streamers: wher∣at <HI>Esplandian</HI> was so glad, that going downe vnto the Hauen, hee presently entered into a boat with <HI>Talanque, Manely,</HI> and diuerse other of the principall captaines to sée who might bee there. And rowing néere vnto it, they knew <HI>Vrganda</HI> that staied for them on the hatches, &amp; stretching forth her armes, spake vnto them &amp; said: My good friends, you are most hartily welcome, I pray you come vp into my ship, y<SUP>t</SUP> I may imbrace you. With that <HI>Esplandian</HI> ente∣red, and as he meant to salute <HI>Vrganda,</HI> she knéeled on the ground to kisse his féet, whereat he being ashamed tooke her vp, and saied vnto her: Madame, I neuer thought you would haue takē plea∣sure to mock with me, séeing I account my self much more bound to you then to any creature liuing in the world. And therfore for Gods cause, if at any time I chaunce to offend you, punish mee I pray you in some sort or other. Most happy Knight, (sayed shée) The aide I hope for at your hands before manie dayes shall passe, mooued mée to doe as I haue done, wherefore I beséech you take it in good part. And with that shee embraced him, and after him, <HI>Talanque, Manely,</HI> and all the rest, euery man doing her great honour, desiring her to shewe them the cause of her so suddaine comming thether. My good friends (saied shee) you shal know it at some other time when better laisure serueth: mean while I am to tell you that it is necessary for you shortly to go vnto the city of Constantinople, where you shall enter all ar∣med &amp; apparelled in y<SUP>e</SUP> same armor I haue brought hither for you,
<PB REF="96"/> and thus must I tell you, that if you should deferre it till another time, it would be preiudiciall to you all. Wherfore I counsel you to do it vpon the first day of the next wéeke, assuring you to be as well receiued of the Emperor, as euer were any knights, which your ease and pleasure in his company, shall continue vntil y<SUP>e</SUP> rol∣ling whéele of Fortune turning about, shall bring with it manie trauels, passions, and aduentures, which shal cause many gréefes and sorrowes both to you and others. And the better to make you beléeue that all I say is true, I tell you that I my selfe shall fall into two of the greatest dangers of my life that euer I had, whe∣ther it bee here or in another place I knowe not. And which is worse, I cannot by any means auoid the same, not knowing any cause how nor wherefore it should be so, although it be in a man∣ner ready to fall vpon mee. Madame (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) before you shall receiue any hurt in our presence, wee will all lose our liues to succour you. My good child (said she) mans destiny of force must bee accomplished. But I pray you let vs enter into some other talke, for this maketh mee melancholy. Madame (saied <HI>Manely</HI>) Is it not your pleasure to goe into the Towne? I (saied she) and I pray you send for <HI>Norandel,</HI> who at this present I knowe is at Alfarin, and I wil giue you as great cause to reioice as euer you had: for that within my shippe I haue brought the king of Den∣marke, wounded in a combate that hee fought against <HI>Garlante</HI> Lord of the Isle of Calafre, that by force would haue taken two Gentlewomen from him. And although <HI>Garlante</HI> bee estéemed a hardy and valiant knight, yet did the king bring him in such case, that vnlesse hee had craued mercy, the king would haue stricken of his head: which he spared vpon condition, that during his life hee should neuer after iniury any knight, which <HI>Garlante</HI> sware and vowed in my presence, for that by chance arriuing there, du∣ring their combate, I heard what passed betwéene tham. And be∣cause I perceiued the King to bee in danger of his person by rea∣son of y<SUP>e</SUP> great number of wounds he had vpon his body, I would not leaue him, but caused him to enter into my shippe, and layed him in the best bed, where now hée is almost healed. Ha (saied <HI>Es∣plandian,</HI>) What good newes are these, of my faith I thought
<PB REF="96"/> verily he had ben dead: wherefore madame, I pray you for Gods cause let mée craue the means to sée him: with y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Vrganda</HI> led him where he lay, but when they saw each other, <HI>Esplandian</HI> could not refraine wéeping, with the great pleasure hée took to sée the king. Neuerthelesse, for y<SUP>t</SUP> time they had no great spéech together, nei∣ther would <HI>Vrganda</HI> permit them to do it, doubting least the king (being yet but weake and féeble) might therby bée hindered of his health. Wherefore she caused <HI>Esplandian</HI> to go forth, and entring with her into y<SUP>e</SUP> boat, they rowed to the shoare, from whence they led <HI>Vrganda</HI> to the best lodging in the town, with as much honor as they could haue done to the Quéenes <HI>Brisenne</HI> or <HI>Oriane,</HI> if any of thē had ben there in presence. The next day <HI>Esplandian</HI> pitying the great number of women &amp; little children y<SUP>t</SUP> had ben kept with∣in the town from the time y<SUP>t</SUP> it was takē, said to his companions, that it would be better to giue them leaue to depart from thence, then to hold them stil, for y<SUP>e</SUP> the longer they continued in y<SUP>e</SUP> town, the more charge they put them to: &amp; to kéep them prisoners (saied he) or in longer seruitude, God may possible be offended with vs. Wherfore if you wil beléeue me, vsing rather mercy then rigour towards them, I am of opinion y<SUP>t</SUP> we send them al to Tesifant to the Princesse <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> who wil thank vs for it, &amp; so shal we be ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of so much charge. To this al the knights agréed, &amp; <HI>Carmelle</HI> was appointed to execute the message, &amp; he y<SUP>t</SUP> had séen the great number of people y<SUP>t</SUP> were about her, especially women, wéeping most bit∣terly to behold themselues banished &amp; driuen from their own hou∣ses, surely he could not chuse vnlesse he were hard harted, but haue pittied their estate. But let them goe, &amp; let vs heare what danger fell vnto <HI>Vrganda</HI> the next day after, who being welcome to the knights, took great pleasure to hear them shew of the aduentures they had found in the Turkish countrey, since the taking of Alfa∣rin. And each man after the other discoursing what they knewe, <HI>Esplandian</HI> remembred the old woman they had séene among the rocks, where she continued, wherat he could not chuse but smile, which <HI>Vrganda</HI> espying, asked him the cause. Madame (said hée) I thought vpon the beauty of a yoong maid, y<SUP>t</SUP> I &amp; some of our com∣pany chanced to sée not far hence, being the best furnished of all
<PB REF="97"/> things for to beautifie her y<SUP>t</SUP> might be found, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> better to describe her vnto you, I can assure you (vpon <HI>Belleris</HI> word) y<SUP>t</SUP> it is at the least eight or nine score years since she first could go &amp; speake, yet hath she so fresh &amp; gallant a colour, y<SUP>t</SUP> to behold her well, I cannot compare her better then vnto the bark of those great Elmes wée commonly find along the high wayes as wée ride in great Brit∣taigne, her hair is as white as snow, and for want of combing all knotted together, which setteth her out so wel, y<SUP>t</SUP> to behold it spred abroad vpon a beares skin (which she weareth for a gown,) there is not any man liuing y<SUP>t</SUP> would not bée surprised with a sodain and vehement loue, in y<SUP>e</SUP> beholding of her <HI>Vrganda</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> had heard of her before, &amp; aboue all things was much desirous to sée her, because of her great skill, saied vnto <HI>Esplandian:</HI> In good faith I knowe her better then you think I do, &amp; am wel assured, y<SUP>t</SUP> in her yong years she hath ben one of the goodliest ladies y<SUP>t</SUP> euer you saw. For shée is both doughter, sister, &amp; aunt vnto a king &amp; is called <HI>Melie,</HI> who for to learn y<SUP>e</SUP> perfect art &amp; science of Nigromancy, hath so much con∣temned the world, y<SUP>t</SUP> for her inheritance shée hath chosen a rocke, wherein she hath caused a caue to bee digged, where shée now re∣maineth &amp; liueth in great misery, &amp; I swear vnto you of my faith, y<SUP>t</SUP> it is aboue twenty yeares &amp; more since I determined to come &amp; sée her, but other affaires y<SUP>t</SUP> touched me néerer, haue still hindered my desire. Madame (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) séeing you are so néere, you may do it now, &amp; all we wil be your guides. I pray you let it be so (said she) &amp; let vs go as soon as we haue dined: which done, and the tables vncouered, euery man made preparation to goe with <HI>Vr∣ganda</HI> to behold y<SUP>t</SUP> sight: but <HI>Esplandian</HI> would haue but thréescore with him, who being wel horsed &amp; armed at al poinis, issued out of Galatia, <HI>Vrganda</HI> on her palfrey, riding among thē, <HI>Belleris</HI> was their guide, &amp; when they came néer vnto the caue where they had found <HI>Melie,</HI> they espied her set crosse-legged vpon the point of a rock, with that <HI>Vrganda</HI> praied them to stay, that she alone might speake secretly vnto her, which the knights agréed vnto. Wher∣with she rode forward, &amp; being néere vnto her, she said: Madame, I pray you bee not offended that I come to sée you, and offer you my seruice. Who are you? (said shee) I am (saied shée) <HI>Vrganda la
<PB REF="97"/> discogneue,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> haue alwayes had a great desire to sée you. Ha <HI>Vr∣ganda,</HI> the wisest lady among all others (said <HI>Melie</HI>) your cōming hether pleaseth mée right well, light downe I pray you, that you and I may talke of such thinges as wée haue taken great paines to learne and vnderstand: for although you haue béene the onely occasion of the Christians arriuall here, whereby our poor coun∣try indureth so much woe, yet I cannot but excuse you, knowing the faith &amp; duty you are bound to shew to your religion. Where∣fore I pray you come néer, and sit downe by mée. <HI>Vrganda</HI> percei∣uing her to bée so old &amp; féeble, did as shee required, hoping by force to stay her there whether she would or no, till her company were come thether, minding to giue her vnto them to bring her to Ga∣latia, but shee met with as crafty a mate as her selfe, for the olde woman perceauing <HI>Vrganda</HI> to bée néere her, went to the mouth of her caue, and said vnto her: <HI>Vrganda,</HI> It would gréeue me that these Knights should heare our talke, wherefore let vs goe in. Whereat <HI>Vrganda</HI> made no difficulty, thinking verily, that if she might once lay hands on her, shee would vse her at her pleasure: wherewith shée followed her, but shee was no sooner entered, but <HI>Melie</HI> stepped to hir and held hir so straight by y<SUP>e</SUP> throat, y<SUP>t</SUP> shée had no means to cal <HI>Esplandian</HI> or any of the rest to help her. But they fearing the worst, ran in all hast vnto the caue, and the first that entred was <HI>Talanque,</HI> &amp; after him <HI>Manely,</HI> and they had no sooner stepped in, but they fell down as if they had béene dead, &amp; their fall was so great, that <HI>Esplandian</HI> that followed them heard it, but hée had a remedye about him against all such aduentures, and that was his good sword, against the which no inchauntment whatso∣euer could ought auaile, which he first found to bée true when hée entred into <HI>Arcabonnes</HI> chamber: he perceauing his two compa∣nions in such case, being much gréeued thereat, willingly would haue reléeued thē, but y<SUP>t</SUP> he spied <HI>Melie</HI> holding <HI>Vrganda</HI> vnder hir knée, séeking by all means to strangle her: which caused him first to succour hir, threatning <HI>Melie</HI> if y<SUP>t</SUP> she did hir hurt, she shold déer∣ly buy it, but for all his threatnings shee ceased not to vse all the meanes shée could for to destroy her, vntill <HI>Esplandian</HI> went neare vnto her, and with his sworde thought to cleaue her head.
<PB REF="98"/> wherwith she began to flie, thinking to be safe within the cham∣ber where she wrought her charmes, but as she stepped vpon the threshold of the dore, <HI>Esplandian</HI> caught her by the Beares skin, and whether she would or not, held her so fast, that shee could goe no further. And as hee lifted vp his arme to kill her, hee remem∣bred that hee should doe wrong, thinking it not conuenient for a Knight to defile his hands in the blood of a simple woman, not a∣ble to resist: and surely y<SUP>t</SUP> thought of his, moderated his colour in such sort, that he purposed not to do it, minding only to draw her out of the vaut: wherewith hee tooke her by the haire, and pulled her with all his force. With that hee espied a great old Ape, with two eies burning like flaming fire, that lept vpon him for to tear his flesh, but hee gaue him such a blow with his fist betwéene the eies, that he strooke him dead. And passing forward, brought <HI>Me∣lie</HI> out of her caue, and leauing her in <HI>Frandalos</HI> kéeping, went in againe to sée if <HI>Vrganda</HI> were aliue, where hee found her in such pain, that it séemed the soule would depart out of her body, wher∣at he had so great pittie, that he tooke her in his armes, and set hir in the aire, the like hee did to <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Manely,</HI> who within one quarter of an hour after, could not call to mind what had hap∣pened vnto thē, but were as whole and as wel as euer they were before. Wherefore they mounted on their horses, taking <HI>Melie</HI> with them that sat vpon <HI>Sergils</HI> horse, and he behind her, holding her in his armes, least she should escape. And God knowes with what ioy <HI>Vrganda</HI> shewed them what feare she had ben in, which as she said was such, that she thought verily to die. But (said shée) euen as one naile driueth out another, so the ioy I haue of my de∣liuery, maketh mee in a manner to forget the paine wherein I was. And with that they entered into the Towne, being almost night.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XL. How Carmelle arriued at Tesisante, and spake with Heliaxe, and of the maruellous combat which Esplandian, Frandalo, Ganda∣lin, and Enil fought against three Gyants and twelue Turkish knights.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Armelle</HI> trauelled so long with the women and children of Galatia, that they arriued at Te∣sifant, where they found both their fathers and husbands as many of them as had saued themselues, as it is said before. Estéeme I pray you what gréefe they had to thinke vpon their exile, and losse of all their goods: Surely there is no heart so hard, but would haue wept with gréefe to be∣hold great numbers of men and women, with diuers litle chil∣dren about them, and not hauing any meanes to giue them bread or drinke. Whereof the Prince <HI>Alphorax</HI> hauing newes, &amp; hea∣ring of their sorow, could not refraine to say in presence of them all. Ah immortall gods, it must néeds be, that either for some great sinne of me or mine, this cruell warre is mooued in my countrey: O gods immortall, let your wrathes appease, and of your infinite goodnes let it rather please you that all the mischiefe which you send vpon those impotent people fall only vpon mée that alone haue mooued your indignations: if not, then I beséech you giue me grace, that to your glory I may driue these cursed Christians (enemies of your holy lawes) out of my countrey, swearing vnto you, that if you vouchsafe your aides, I will make so great a slaughter of them, that thereby your wrathes shall bée appeased, if it be so that the small indeauour I haue hither to vsed to driue them hence be the occasion of your anger towards me. Then hée asked them how they got away. My Lord (said hée that brought him newes) a faire gentle woman named <HI>Carmelle</HI> (as I heare say) hath brought them hither, and desireth to speake with you and the princesse <HI>Heliaxe.</HI> Ladie (said <HI>Alphorax</HI> to his
<PB REF="99"/> wife, doe you know her? I my lord (said <HI>Heliaxe</HI>) for she bare me company all that day that I fell into <HI>Frandalos</HI> hands, being very ready to do me all the pleasure and seruice that shee could deuise: wherefore my lord, I pray you let her haue that honour and en∣tertainement she deserueth. Lady (said <HI>Alphorax</HI>) I am wel con∣tent therewith. With that some of them ran to fetch <HI>Carmelle,</HI> who being come in presence of <HI>Alphorax,</HI> went presently vnto the Princesse <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> and without salutation, said vnto her: ma∣dame, you know the lord and maister that I serue, who only hath aucthority ouer me, think it not therefore strange, if in any sort I haue not humbled my selfe before the prince <HI>Alphorax</HI> or to you: And to the end Madame, that you should knowe the cause of my arriuall here, I thinke the taking of Galatia is not vnknowne vnto you, whereof at this present the Christians are Lords and maisters, hauing conquered it from you by force, not finding any Garrison therein, but a number of women and little children: which my lord <HI>Esplandian</HI> &amp; his company send vnto your grace, committing them vnto your good discretion. Assuring you (their Religion onely excepted) they are ready to doe you any seruice that they may. <HI>Carmelle</HI> (saied the Princesse) this is not the first fauour they haue shewed vnto me, I am of long time so much be∣holding to them, that bee it in their aduersities or their prosperi∣ties, I will neuer bee vnmindfull of the same. Neuerthelesse, I am assured, that at this day I haue not, neither yet shall euer haue the meanes to doe it, (as I thinke) vnlesse that variable fortune turne her rouling whéele, and abase them as much as now they are aduaunced, then (if it so fall out) they shall full well perceaue, howe much I estéeme their vertues and fauours they haue showne vnto mee. <HI>Carmelle</HI> (saied <HI>Alphorax</HI>) haue they willed you to deliuer no message vnto mee? No my lord (saied shee) but I tell you plaine, they are determined verye shortly to come and visite you, in such manner, as will not greatly like you. By all my gods (saied <HI>Alphorax</HI>) I will ease them of that burthen, if they make not the more hast. For I haue so many men preparing, that I meane to goe in person to Constantinople to destroye the wicked Emperour
<PB REF="99"/> and all the Christians. Then shall my wife haue meanes (if shee thinke good) to acknowledge the fauours towards them, which they haue showen vnto her, as shee sayeth. My lorde (said <HI>Carmelle</HI>) Mens enterprises doe oftentimes fall out con∣trarie to their expectations, and God that is in Heauen a∣boue, commaundeth and disposeth of all thinges as it pleaseth him, and not as wee would haue it. Nowe Madame (sayed shee to <HI>Heliaxe</HI>) I haue done the commaundement of those that sent mee hether, wherefore I beséech you let mee be safely con∣ducted to the place from whence I came. My lord (said the prin∣cesse to <HI>Alphorax</HI>) I pray you shewe her so much fauour, for it would gréeue mée much that shée should receaue the least iniurie in the world, which hee graunted vnto her: and withall <HI>Heli∣axe</HI> gaue her for her paines one of the richest gownes shee had. Wherewith shee caused her to bee conducted by twenty knights vnto the Towne of Galatia: where being arriued, shee shew∣ed them what shee had done, as also what spéeches the Prince <HI>Alphorax</HI> vsed vnto her, which <HI>Vrganda</HI> marked well, saying vnto the Knights: In faith my good friendes, as touching <HI>Al∣phorax</HI> high woordes, they are the fruites of his nature, being altogether prowd and arrogant: Neuerthelesse, I can assure you, that fortune promiseth him great matters. And because it will not bee long before they doe happen, I will nowe vse no wordes of them: Praying some of you to shewe mee so much fauour to retourne againe vnto <HI>Melies</HI> caue, to fetch her Bookes that wée left behind vs. Which being in my posses∣sion, it may bee they will serue hereafter to doe both you and manie others pleasure. <HI>Esplandian</HI> hearing <HI>Vrganda</HI> speake with such affection, and knowing the desire shee had to haue the bookes, answered her and saied: Madame, before I sléepe I will sée if I can fulfill your pleasure. And without longer staying, hee desired <HI>Enil, Frandalo,</HI> and <HI>Gandalin,</HI> to beare him company: who presently armed themselues, and being on horse∣backe without any other companye then their owne Squires, issued out of the Towne, leauing <HI>Vrganda</HI> with <HI>Norandel,</HI>
<PB REF="100"/> that was newly come from the city of Alfarin. The four knights rode so long till they came vnto <HI>Melies</HI> rocke, where not far from thence they found thrée giants and twelue knights, that with a loud voice stood at the mouth of the caue calling <HI>Melie,</HI> for the shepheards kéeping shéepe in the fields (hauing séene her led vnto Galatia) ranne to tell them newes: and to know the truth they were expressely come thither. <HI>Esplandian</HI> and his company knew them well to be their enemies, wherfore they determined to giue them battaile although their number was far greater: wherfore being couered with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hields, and their swords readie in their hands, they entred among them, <HI>Esplandian</HI> met the first giant, <HI>Frandalo</HI> the second, and <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> the third: and <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> gaue his giant so great a blow, that therewith he made him take so great a leape, that both master and horse lay vpon the ground not once remoouing han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or foot. But it fell out otherwise with the rest, for they hauing broken their speares vpon <HI>Franda∣lo, Gandalin,</HI> and <HI>Enil,</HI> their horses being loosely bridled, bare them at least a mile from thence, before they could make them stay. With that the foure Christian knights were inclosed by twelue Turkes, whereof thrée of them at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e first charge were stricken dead vnto the ground: wherewith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e fight began to be most pe∣rillous and fierce, in such sort, that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore the two giants could returne againe, fiue other of the Turkes were in such case, that the best of them was hurt to death, so there rested but four: which <HI>Esplandian</HI> and <HI>Frandalo</HI> left fighting with <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil,</HI> to méete the two giants that in great hast came towards them to helpe their companions: and as they met togither neuer was there brauer fight, for <HI>Esplandian</HI> thinking vpon the princes <HI>Le∣onorine,</HI> gaue not one blowe but hée made the blood to follow on him that had the stroke: whereby the rocke became all bloodie, yet he found his enemy no lesse able to requite his blowes, so that in short space his shield was so hewed and cut in pieces, that there rested nothing but the lethers in his hands: whereat he was in such a rage, that rising in his stirrops, hée gaue his enemie so great a blow vpon the coife of stéele, that he strake it off, where∣with the giants eyes started in his head, which made him bowe
<PB REF="100"/> his necke vpon the horses maine, and withall let fall his sword. With that <HI>Esplandian</HI> strake him such another blowe betwéene the necke and shoulders that he cut off his head: wherewith the horse ranne vp and downe the fields with his dead Giant on his backe: meane time <HI>Frandalo</HI> handled the other Giant in such sort, that hee had put him out of breath. <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> for their partes doing no lesse, for they two fighting against foure, behaued themselues so couragiously, that they slewe two of their hardiest enemies: yet the other two would neuer yéeld, although they were still readie to flée, especially when they perceiued <HI>Es∣plandian</HI> comming towardes them. And to say truth, it was not possible for them to make any resistance: yet hée stayed a while, because he perceiued some of them that were stricken downe to rise againe, and take their swordes in hand: whereat he turned about, but it chaunced that his horses foote lighting betwéene a cliffe stucke fast, and was f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ced to fall downe, whereby <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> was in the greatest daunger of death that euer hée had, by reason that his ene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es were on all sid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s about him ready to thrust their swordes into his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elly: a thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erie easie to be done if God had not prouided f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and giuen strength and agilitie to his horse to rise againe with his master on his backe: who perceiuing himselfe at libertie, and hauing his sword in hande, made such execution on the Turkes, that he left not one aliue: wherewith those two that fought with <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> fledde along the mountaine, as if all the deuils in hell had béene behind them, and not béeing pursued saued themselues, leauing the Gy∣ant behinde them for a pawne, to whome <HI>Frandalo</HI> graunted life, not onely because hée asked mercie, but for that hée was in a manner dead.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLI. How Esplandian entred into Melies caue, to fetch her bookes, and of an assault made vpon him, Frandalo, Enil, and Gandalin, as they thought to returne againe vnto Galatia.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He combat ended as you heard before, ech man caused his woundes to be dressed and bound vp in the best manner they could: then <HI>Esplandian</HI> entred into <HI>Melies</HI> caue to fetch the bookes he sought, where hée went into a faire chamber béeing foure square, about the which there grewe so much Iuie, that it might verily be iudged to haue béene placed there for the hangings of the chamber: in this chamber at ech corner there hung foure lampes, that burnt both night and day and neuer went forth, so cunningly could the Enchantresse shew her Art in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place: and as <HI>Esplandian</HI> loo∣ked well about him, he espied the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of another chamber, in the middle whereof stood a great candlesticke all of massie gold with seuen branches, and in euery branch a waxe candle that burned continually: hard by it stood a Cypres table, whereon lay <HI>Me∣lies</HI> bookes, some couered with plates of gold and grauen vpon it, others with siluer, bound and embossed round about, which <HI>Es∣plandian</HI> tooke and carried with him out of the caue, giuing them to kéepe vnto his squire, and mounting on their horses, they rode the same way they came, thinking presently to be at Gala∣tia againe. But they were stayed sooner than they looked for, for the Turkes that fled away (as you heard before) made an alarme at a little towne not farre from thence, whereby there issued twenty horse and fortie footmen, who being assured that foure knights onely and no more had ouerthrowne their men, made all the spéed they could to inclose them, specially those that were wel horsed: <HI>Frandalo</HI> and his company perceiued them a farre off yet could they hardly shunne them, but of force must fight, or els
<PB REF="101"/> endure the shame to flie away. Wherefore <HI>Esplandian</HI> was in mind to trie their fortune, and to send one of their squires in all hast vnto Galatia, to aduertise them of the danger they were in, that they might succour them: whereto <HI>Frandalo</HI> would not giue consent, shewing what great paine and trauaile both they and their horses haue endured all that day, as also the great number of their enemies in regard of them, in such sort (said he) that if we take vpon vs for to fight with them, I am in doubt, that thin∣king to winne honour, we shall be counted rash and presumptu∣ous fooles. What then? (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) will you endure the shame to flie away? In good truth (said he) for my part I had ra∣ther endure the hazzard of life or death, what euer shall happen. Then we will doe thus (said <HI>Frandalo:</HI>) my squire shall runne vn∣to Galatia to aduertise <HI>Talanque</HI> and the rest how we staied be∣hind. Meane time, I know a bridge not farre from hence, whe∣ther wée will goe and defend the same, till our aid shall come, where we cannot be assailed by them all at once: otherwise thinke with your selfe what meanes we haue to resist so many men both on horse and foot, that come purposely to assaile vs. Let vs goe then (said <HI>Esplandian</HI>) wherewith leauing the way on the right hand, they turned to the left, as <HI>Frandalo</HI> ledde them: and they had not ridden very farre but they came vnto a little riuer somewhat déepe, ouer the which there stoode a bridge, where they had no sooner arriued, but they were presently charged by their enemies, especially by one of the Turkes that was most braue and sumptuous, and best mounted of them all, as béeing their captaine: who bearing a great launce in his hand, began to crie most vehemently in the Arabian tongue vnto <HI>Esplandian</HI> and his companions, saying: You dogges, you flye away, but by our gods it shall cost you all your liues: wherewith <HI>Enil</HI> that heard his threatnings better than the rest, turned his face, and set spurres to his horse, the Turke and hée méeting so fiercely togither, that <HI>Enil</HI> was hurt in the right arme, and the Turke thrust cleane through the body, wherewith hee fell presently starke dead vnto the ground: Which set his companions in such a rage to sée their champion thus suddainly slaine, that they
<PB REF="102"/> thought to inclose <HI>Enil,</HI> but he found means to recouer the bridge: surely whosoeuer had séen the great prowesse of those four cham∣pions, might with good reason estéeme them as they were, speci∣ally <HI>Esplandian</HI> that stroke not one blowe in vaine. And although they were but fewe in comparison of their enemies, yet they did twice or thrice ouerthrow diuers of the Turkes that séemed bol∣dest to aduenture forward, in such sort, that had it not béene for the footemen that came vpon them, the horsemen had but little preuailed: whereat it is not to be maruailed, because the greatest part of them were citizens, altogither vnexpert in armes, and fitter to banket at a table than to guide a horse or breake a lance: whereby in lesse than a quarter of an houre the foure knightes had done them great hurt: and so much, that neither the horse∣men nor footmen durst once set forward to enter vpon the bridge, till one of them determined to make proofe, thereby if it were pos∣sible to inclose them round about. This Turkes name was <HI>Tlu∣acam,</HI> a valiant and hardy knight, as he well shewed before the combat ended: for although the water was déepe and the other side hard to clime vp, yet he waded through, and at diuers times bare eight more of his companions ouer: which <HI>Frandalo</HI> and the rest perceiuing, they were constrained to deuide themselues, <HI>Esplandian</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> staying at the end of the Bridge where the combat first began, <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Gandalin</HI> standing at the other, and God knowes what trouble they had, for <HI>Tluacam</HI> desirous to winne honour or to loose his life, with his lance in hand, char∣ged <HI>Gandalin</HI> in such sort, that both man and horse had like to fallen to the ground, and withall he brake his speare: wherfore taking his sword in hand, striking on both sides, and thinking to be seconded by his fellowes, put his horse in such a fury, that whe∣ther he would or not he bare him to y<SUP>e</SUP> middle of the bridge: where thinking to stay, the horses féet slid from him, whereby both hée and his master fell into the riuer and were drowned: whereat the Turkes gaue so great a crie, that they séemed madde, and bowing downe their heads thinking to acquite their losse, vsed all the force they could on both sides the bridge to enter vpon the foure knightes: who susteined their assault so brauely, that the
<PB REF="102"/> Turkes at last were forced to recule, wherof nine were thrown into the water, but <HI>Esplandian</HI> and his company were so weary, that in a manner they could fight no longer. With that they per∣ceiued their aid in all hast comming towards them: the occasion why they stayed so long was because <HI>Frenace, Frandalos</HI> squire, that went to séeke <HI>Manely</HI> and the rest, thinking to find his ma∣ster where he left him, had led them thither, but not finding them there, supposed them to be gone vnto the bridge: and to say truth, they arriued in very good time, for that <HI>Esplandian</HI> and his thrée companions were almost cleane out of breath: but when they perceiued their aide, neuer did poore prisoners that were set at li∣bertie more reioyce, nor were better pleased: and the Turkes on the contrary side neuer more astonished, yet they held close togi∣ther, determining rather to reuenge their deathes than once to yéeld vnto their enemies: so that before the Knightes of Galatia could enter in among them, they gaue them much to do, although in the end they ouercame them, whereby not one escaped aliue, to carry newes vnto their friends. <HI>Enil</HI> at the first onset had béen sore wounded, as you heard before, wherefore hée caused his wounds to be searched: the like did the rest of the hurt knights. Which done, they set forward to Galatia, contenting them∣selues for that day with the victory it had pleased God to send them. And comming to the gate, they found <HI>Vrganda</HI> readie to receiue them: who knowing how all had past, and the daunger wherein <HI>Esplandian</HI> had béen, iestingly saide vnto him: In faith my Lord, said shée, if I were afraid of death when I fell into <HI>Me∣lies</HI> hands, I beléeue you were not in much better case since that I saw you last, as I vnderstand by those that know what dom∣mage you were in. Madame (said he) I know I am a mortall man, and that my life and death are in the hands of God, as it pleaseth him to dispose, and I confesse vnto you, if wée had not béene succoured, that in the end we could not haue endured: yet am I well assured, that before it had come to passe, we had laid so many enemies on the ground, that the rest should haue had grea∣ter cause to lament their losse, than boast of their conquest. <HI>Vr∣ganda</HI> perceiued by <HI>Esplandians</HI> words that he liked not her spéech,
<PB REF="103"/> whereupon shee said vnto him: My Lord, pardon me I beséech you, and excuse the indiscretion of a woman, specially in mée, who at this present had forgotten my selfe. Madame (said <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI>) you may command me, and likewise set me forth for a cow∣ard, hardy, or any other what it pleaseth you to tearme me. In which manner talking togither, they came vnto his lodging, where master <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (newly come from Alfarin) visited his wounds, and the rest likewise that had cause to vse his helpe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLII. How the Knights of great Brittaine that were at Galatia imbarked themselues with Vrganda in the great serpent, to saile vnto Con∣stantinople, and what happened vnto them.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Knightes that had béen hurt at the last encounter, for the space of fiftéene daies after were forced to kéepe their chambers vntill their woundes were healed: during which time, <HI>Vrganda</HI> tooke great pleasure in reading <HI>Melies</HI> bookes which <HI>Esplandian</HI> caused to bée brought vnto her: wherein shée found such wonderfull coniurations and deui∣ses of Magicke Art, that she was abashed how shée that had had them so long time in her possession, knew no more than yet shée did, estéeming the Enchantresse Lady to haue béen the perfectest schollar that euer studied in that art, as it well appeared by her bookes. Now the time approched wherein it was expedient (ac∣cording to the destinies appointed) that <HI>Esplandian</HI> and his com∣panions should goe vnto Constantinople: wherefore as soone as their wounds were healed, <HI>Vrganda</HI> caused them to bée assem∣bled, and standing in the middest of them all, she said vnto them: My good friends, knowing part of the prosperities and aduersi∣ties which the heauens foreshewe vnto you all, I came hither
<PB REF="103"/> specially to sée <HI>Esplandian</HI> and you, of whome I haue receiued great pleat pleasure, perceiuing at my arriuall the loue and ami∣tie that is among you, with the great desire you haue to accom∣plish the order of knighthood: not for the glory and recompence of this world, but onely for the increasing of our faith and the seruice of God, that shall reward you for it: and to the end you may continue in this forwardnes, and that the thing which I pretend, may happily fall out, I will from henceforth not only imploy my person but my Arte, which hath pleased God to lend me, wherewith I will aduise you what I shall find conuenient and necessarie for the augmentation of your honours alreadie spread throughout the world: which to begin I am of opinion, that you all imbarke your selues with me in the great serpent, that shall bring vs vnto Constantinople to the Emperour, for without him it is impossible that this great enterprise you haue taken in hand can come to good effect: as also that hee himselfe before many yéeres are past, shall be found in maruellous neces∣sitie, and such, that he shall account himselfe most happie to haue your aid: and with good reason, for that in the end both hee and you shall ouercome those hazzards according to your desires. Then shall you plainely knowe, that this that I foreshew vnto you is most true. While <HI>Vrganda</HI> vsed these wordes, all the com∣pany stood still intentiue for to heare her: and had it not béen that they estéemed her words to be most true, they had doubted of the threatnings shée vsed against the Emperour, he béeing so great and puissant a Monarch. Neuerthelesse the issue of that trou∣ble which shée assured vnto them, gaue them some ease and con∣tentation of minde: in expectation whereof, they made account in the meane time to prooue their strengths and forces, that thereby their valour and magnanimitie might be further spread abroad. And as touching their voiage to the Emperour, as <HI>Vr∣ganda</HI> gaue them direction, it was onely the thing wherevnto <HI>Esplandian</HI> did aspire, hoping that if the warres were openly proclaimed in the Grecian Empire, and the Emperours daun∣ger so imminent, to shewe such valour and prowesse in martiall exploits, that hée would not onely frée and acquite his father
<PB REF="104"/> of the promise he had made to serue the Ladies, but confirme the loue that the princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> bare vnto him, in such sort, that he might obtaine her for his wife: which caused him to speake for all his companie, assuring <HI>Vrganda</HI> that not one of them but was readie to obey and goe where it pleased her. My friends (said she) then I pray you to morrow in the morning cause your horses to be shipped in my shippe, and for armour take you no care, I will prouide you thereof so well, that ech man shall find himselfe con∣tent: let it suffice you to imbarke your selues and set saile: for of∣ten times an enterprise deferred ouer long, falleth not out as mē desire it should, not for want of good and wise counsell, but by the negligēce of those that are appointed to execute the same. Thus was their voiage to Constantinople agréed vpon, in such sort, that all the knights of great Brittaine entred into the great ser∣pent, taking with them <HI>Frandalo, Melie,</HI> and the captaine of Te∣sifant that had béen taken prisoner, as you heard before, leauing the Admirals souldiers for garrison in the towne. Which done, the ship went forward of it selfe, sayling towards the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> where being arriued they tooke <HI>Armato</HI> king of Turkie and his two captaines with them: for <HI>Vrganda</HI> wil∣led them so to doe: and sixe daies after, the great serpent arriued within halfe a mile of Constantinople, where she staied. Then <HI>Vrganda</HI> caused her Knightes to be armed with the armour shée had brought, which were white, with a red crosse both before and behind, most comely to behold. They were in all fortie knights, whose names are as followeth: <HI>Esplandian, Frandalo, Norandel, Talanque, Manely</HI> the wise, <HI>Ambor</HI> of Gandel, <HI>Grauate</HI> of the fearfull valley, <HI>Gandalin, Enil, Trion</HI> cousin to quéene <HI>Briolanie, Brauor</HI> sonne of the giant <HI>Balan, Belleris, Elion le delibere, Lico∣ran</HI> of the white Tower, <HI>Listoran</HI> of the siluer bridge, <HI>Landin</HI> of Sariaque, <HI>Imosil</HI> of Burgondie, <HI>Ledadrin</HI> of Ferraque, <HI>Sarqui∣les</HI> cousin to <HI>Angriotes, Palomir, Branfil, Tantiles</HI> the proud, <HI>Gal∣bron</HI> sonne of <HI>Isamel, Carpin</HI> his brother, <HI>Carin</HI> of Carante, <HI>Atta∣lio</HI> sonne of <HI>Oliuas, Bracele</HI> sonne of <HI>Bandoyuas, Garamante</HI> sonne of <HI>Norgales, Amphinio</HI> of Almain, <HI>Brandonie</HI> of Fraunce, <HI>Pena∣trie</HI> of Spaine, <HI>Flamene</HI> his brother, <HI>Culspicio</HI> of Bohemia,
<PB REF="104"/> <HI>Amandario</HI> of litle Brittaine, <HI>Siluester</HI> of Hungaria, <HI>Manely</HI> of Swethland, <HI>Galfarie</HI> of Italie, <HI>Galiot</HI> of Scotland, <HI>Amandalie</HI> his brother, and <HI>Calfeur</HI> the glorious. Being arriued, the shippe was presently espied by the citizens which they knewe, hauing séene it before when it put them in such feare, as you haue heard, but hoping for him that vsed ordinarily to saile therein, they all ranne vnto the walles, and along the shore to sée him land: wher∣with the noise and rumour was so great, that the Emperour had newes thereof béeing as then talking with the ladies. Those newes pleased the Princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> so well, that she no sooner heard the great serpent named, but she rose vp and went vnto the windowes to sée if shée could espie her loue <HI>Esplandian:</HI> but the ship was somewhat too farre off, neither did it mooue from the place whereas it lay. Wherfore fearing to be deceiued as she had béen before, she began to change colour: which Quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> perceiued, and iesting said vnto her: Madame, doe you make this pitifull countenance to dissemble the ioy you haue conceiued, or for feare I should beguile you of him that commeth to sée you? How now cousin (said she) how long haue you learned to mock? In faith I neuer thought vpon the first of those two points, and much lesse am I in doubt of the second, for you know as much as my selfe, and yet I am not ignorant that when the great serpent was there where I now behold it, he whome we expect came not thither, wherefore I feare (and with good reason) that wée shall now be serued in like sort: and as she ended her spéech, the shippe came within a bow shot of the hauen where they might perceiue one of her sides to open, from whence they put out a boat, and not long after they saw <HI>Carmelle</HI> and two other gentlewomen come forth, the two gentlewomen playing most swéetly vpon two in∣struments, which they did till they arriued at the shore: from whence they went vnto the Emperor, who knowing <HI>Carmelle,</HI> had better hope to sée <HI>Esplandian</HI> than euer he had before: &amp; going vnto her to aske what newes, she made no more reuerence vnto him than she vsed at other times to do, saying vnto him: My lord, <HI>Esplandian</HI> my master (that you so much desire to sée) is now arri∣ued before the town in y<SUP>e</SUP> great serpent with diuers other knights
<PB REF="105"/> his friends and allies, and <HI>Vrganda la disogneue,</HI> desiring you to shew them the fauour to stay in your pallace, where they meane to come and visit your grace. Truly <HI>Carmelle</HI> (said the Emperor) I neuer heard message in al my life that pleased me so wel, I am content to do as they desire, although I was determined to méet them, and to giue them that entertainement they deserue: But séeing they will haue it otherwise, I will satisfie their desires. That is sufficient (said <HI>Carmelle</HI>) we will then retourne to them againe, to certefie your graces answere. Goe (said the Emperor) and tell them from me, that they shall be most heartily welcome. With that <HI>Carmelle</HI> with the two Gentlewomen departed to∣wards the Hauen: meane time, whosoeuer had beheld the Prin∣cesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> might easily haue iudged the alteration of her heart, it was so full of ioy, that without Quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> cau∣sed her to refraine, she would peraduenture haue done done som∣thing whereby her honour had been blemished, minding to leaue the Empresse her mother, and goe to méete <HI>Esplandian,</HI> whose ab∣sence had procured so great sorrow in her mind. But the Quéene as a wise and discréet lady persuaded her so much, that shée stayed at the window, whereby her alteration might not be perceaued. <HI>Carmelle</HI> staied not long, but went into the boate, rowing to the great serpent, where being entered, there were presently two boats more put forth, that brought horses to land, which don, they returned again to fetch the knights, &amp; those y<SUP>t</SUP> would went forth, and among them six gentlewomen, thrée of thē sounding y<SUP>e</SUP> recor∣ders, thē ceasing, the other thrée plaied on y<SUP>e</SUP> lute and vials, in that manner being landed &amp; mounted on their horses, they entred into the Citty, y<SUP>e</SUP> sixe Gentlewomen marching first, after them y<SUP>e</SUP> two Turkish captaines y<SUP>t</SUP> were taken at y<SUP>e</SUP> siege of the castle <HI>La mon∣taigne defendu,</HI> then y<SUP>e</SUP> captain of Tesifant, next followed <HI>Armato,</HI> &amp; with him y<SUP>e</SUP> princesse <HI>Melie,</HI> apparrelled in y<SUP>e</SUP> beares skin as shée had ben taken, then followed y<SUP>e</SUP> forty knights two in a ranke, ar∣med horse &amp; man in one sort of armour, in y<SUP>e</SUP> middest of them road <HI>Vrganda,</HI> talking to <HI>Esplandian</HI> and y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Denmarke. And as they approched y<SUP>e</SUP> pallace, y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperor▪ y<SUP>e</SUP> Empresse, and the ladies met thē, where y<SUP>e</SUP> emperor comming to <HI>Vrganda,</HI> did her as much
<PB REF="105"/> honor as if she had ben y<SUP>e</SUP> greatest quéen in the world. Mean time the knights being among the Ladies, gaue occasion to bee found no lesse courteous, then prompt &amp; valiant in armes, specially <HI>Es∣plandian,</HI> who comming to the princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> knéeled on the ground to kisse her hands, but shee refused it, making y<SUP>e</SUP> whole cō∣pany beléeue, she was offended with him for delaying the time to come vnto the court as he had promised. Which the Emperour perceiuing, could not refraine to smile, and saied vnto her: How now daughter? Is this the good entertainement you shewe vnto your knight, and y<SUP>e</SUP> thankes you giue him, for comming expressely hether to serue you? I pray you call to mind, that he deserueth a better countenance, were it only for his fathers sake, to whome you are so much beholding. My lord (said shee) y<SUP>t</SUP> is y<SUP>e</SUP> cause I am so much offended with him, for if he resembled y<SUP>e</SUP> knight with y<SUP>e</SUP> gréen sword as much in curtesie as in countenance, he had not stayed so long to obay his fathers wil, &amp; to satisfie y<SUP>e</SUP> requests y<SUP>t</SUP> you &amp; I haue made vnto him by <HI>Carmelle</HI> and others, as your grace kneweth. Before God (said y<SUP>e</SUP> emperor) you say true: yet I could neuer haue ben persuaded you would conceiue displeasure so long time, consi∣dring what he hath done, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> rich presents he sent to you. My lord (said she) if he hath done any thing for me, it was without my cō∣mandement, I had rather he had done lesse in those things, &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> hée had ben more obedient to his fathers wil &amp; mine. Madame (said y<SUP>e</SUP> emperor to <HI>Vrganda</HI>) you sée in my daughter how great y<SUP>e</SUP> choler of an angry woman is. My lord (said she) she hath reason so to do, for y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Esplandian</HI> obeying his father, ought to confirm himself both to her wil &amp; yours. And hauing failed therin, all he saith y<SUP>t</SUP> he hath done for her sake, may be accounted nothing, although I am assu∣red, y<SUP>t</SUP> the remembrance of my lady your daughter hath made him (being in fight) enter into such danger, that it was most strange howe hee could escape. Wherefore Madame (said shee to <HI>Leo∣norine</HI>) he deserueth pardō for the same, &amp; so I pray you grant him. While <HI>Vrganda</HI> spake, y<SUP>e</SUP> Princes beheld <HI>Esplandian</HI> with so great affection, that in a maner shée liued and died in him: and he for his part by hir felt in what sort loue vseth those he holds in his power. Wherby she cōtinued a long time without answering <HI>Vrganda,</HI>
<PB REF="106"/> not for any euill will to her in vsing of those spéeches, but rather féeling such alteration in her mind, that she trembled like a leaf. But in the end she remembred her selfe, and saied vnto her: Ma∣dame, séeing it is your pleasure that I remit his offence, I am content to doe it, vpon condition, that if hée forget himselfe as hée hath done heretofore, you shall beare the punishment for him. With that she tooke him by the hand, and made him rise vp, chan∣ging spéech, because the Empresse (that in the meane time talked with the king of Denmarke) came thether, whereby <HI>Esplandian</HI> was constrained to leaue the Princesse, and salute her. The em∣peror al that while had giuen no entertainement to king <HI>Arma∣to,</HI> as knowing him not, but when they shewed him which was he, he imbraced him and said: My lord and brother, I beséech you pardon my ignorance, in not entertaining you before this time, as not knowing you, but I will amend the fault when you think good. My lord (saied <HI>Armato</HI>) I am now (as it pleaseth fortune) in place where you may command me, yet I pray you call to mind who I was, and what I may bee, and doe for me as you would I should do for you if your case were mine: Considering with your selfe, that the like hard fortune may fall on you, and that it is no lesse vertue to intertain the vanquished courteously, then to ouer∣throw the puissant enemie. With that the Emperour led him into his pallace, the rest following after him, and when they were in the hall, hee left them with the Empresse to speake vn∣to <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and taking him aside, saied vnto him: <HI>Frandalo,</HI> to let you knowe howe well I do account of the great good seruice you haue done for mée, I will that from henceforth you shall bee my chéefe standard bearer, in which place I nowe esta∣blish you. For the which <HI>Frandalo</HI> thanked him most hum∣bly, accounting himselfe most happye to haue so great au∣thoritie.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII. How Norandel and Queene Minoresse fell in loue one of the other, and what conference they had together.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Emperour being among his Knights, making them all the cheare and honour that hee could deuise. It happened that the Princesse <HI>Leonorine</HI> and Quéene <HI>Mino∣resse</HI> séeing the king of Denmark and <HI>No∣randel</HI> together, called <HI>Carmelle,</HI> and as∣ked her who they were. My Ladies (saied shée) you haue séen him that hath the least beard here before, (which is the king of Denmarke) for hee came hether with <HI>Frandalo,</HI> the other is <HI>Norandel</HI> king <HI>Luisarts</HI> sonne, estéemed for one of the hardiest knights liuing on the earth. I pray you (said the Princesse) desire them to come hether, that wée may speake with them. With that <HI>Carmelle</HI> called them vnto her, and as they were before the two Princesses, the more they beheld the excellency of their beauties, the more they maruailed at it, and not without cause, for next vnto <HI>Leonorine</HI> there could hardly be found in all Gréece one that matched quéene <HI>Minoresse,</HI> especially in comelinesse and good behauiour, but if shee had some perfection in her, nature had not forgotten her selfe in forming the two knights, especially <HI>Norandel,</HI> who till that time had ne∣uer felt the stings of loue, no more had Quéene <HI>Minoresse.</HI> Ne∣uerthelesse, that little théefe surprised them so couertly, that hee bound them both, making them captiues one to the other, in such manner, that after many Questions and Answeres propounded they drew themselues apart, leauing the king of Denmarke tal∣king with the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> the Quéene asking <HI>Norandel</HI> what hee thought of the Princesse. Madame (said hée) although I haue heard her estéemed for one of the goodliest ladies in y<SUP>e</SUP> world, yet did I neuer thinke her beautie had béene such as now I sée it is, although you are little behinde her in that respect, whereby I
<PB REF="107"/> might estéeme my selfe most happy if I had ben asléepe that day I enterprised to take my iourney hether. Wherfore (said the quéen) haue you had so ill intertainment in this court? No madame (said he) but there is one hath stollen that from me which I haue most carefully kept during my life. The Quéene not knowing what he meant, was thereat abashed, asking him what it was, &amp; whe∣ther he knew the théefe. I madame (saied he) and it resteth in you to do me iustice, if it bée your pleasure: for you &amp; none other haue that whereof I speake. In good faith (saied the Quéene) you shall pardon mee, for I haue nothing of yours that I cam remember. Madame (saied <HI>Norandel</HI>) since the time I first did knowe what belonged to a man, I kept my liberty, not alienating it to any one: But comming hether (I had no sooner set mine eie on you) but I found my selfe of a fréeman a bondslaue and captiue to your ladiships good fauor: which I beséech you afore me, in recompence of y<SUP>e</SUP> liberty you now haue taken from me. Truly sir knight (saied she) you haue at this presēt run too far astray, for if you beheld me as you should, you had not found me such a one as you say, &amp; wold haue ben twice aduised to vse such spéeches as you do. Neuerthe∣lesse, I will not take them at your hands (being a stranger) in so euill part as mine honour doth require, and I think likewise you speake farre otherwise then you meane: which she said to vnder∣mine him, thereby to sée if <HI>Norandels</HI> words were spoken from the heart, who hearing that ouerthwart answere, was much a∣stonished, but being moued with loue, answerd her and said: Ma∣dame, pardon my boldnesse I beséech you, but I sweare vnto you, by the faith of a knight, that I haue discouered the secret of my heart: and if you will not beléeue me at this time, I hope in time to come to doe so much, that you shall well perceiue what great desire I haue to bee your Knight, if it will please you to graunt mee so much fauour to accept mee for the same. When Quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> perceaued him so earnest, as that in vttering those words hee shewed great affection, shee estéemed in her minde to haue sufficient argument that might persuade her to beléeue his wordes, wherewith shee answered him and saied: My lorde <HI>Norandel,</HI> If you doe as you promise, I well beléeue that you
<PB REF="107"/> say: and for the accepting you to bee my Knight, mee thinketh I should doe wrong to refuse so small a fauor to so courteous a gen∣tleman as you are: wherfore I both grant it and desire it of you. With y<SUP>t</SUP> she took a litle ring (she commonly wore) off from hir fin∣ger, giuing it vnto him for a witnesse of their new confirmed ali∣ance: And had it not ben y<SUP>t</SUP> y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperor was ready to go to supper, they had no sooner left talking, but y<SUP>e</SUP> Empresse went in, whereby quéen <HI>Minoresse</HI> was constrained to follow after, taking <HI>Melie</HI> &amp; <HI>Carmelle</HI> w<SUP>t</SUP> hir, to whom she did al honor &amp; good intertainmēt she could deuise: supper being don, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> tables vncouered, y<SUP>e</SUP> princes <HI>Le∣onorine</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> had séen <HI>Norandel</HI> &amp; quéen <HI>Minoresse</HI> talking w<SUP>t</SUP> so great affection, doubted some feathers in y<SUP>e</SUP> wind, wherefore taking her aside, said vnto hir: Cousin, I beléeue y<SUP>e</SUP> knight y<SUP>t</SUP> intertained you so long, told you some news out of great Brittaine, or somthing els y<SUP>t</SUP> pleased you ful wel, I pray you fair lady tel me what it was, for you were very earnest to harken thervnto. How now madame? (said she) since when I pray you, did you learn to mock? cal you y<SUP>e</SUP> mocking (said she) which is don in earnest? I pray God y<SUP>e</SUP> mockery I mean to you may fal out as I desire it wold: thē shal I at y<SUP>e</SUP> least haue as good aduātage at you, as you haue had at me, which wold please me wel, not so much to haue a cōpaniō in mine own estate, as to yéeld you in exchāge y<SUP>e</SUP> like pleasure I haue receiued at your hands, whē you first were made acquainted with y<SUP>e</SUP> loue betwéen <HI>Esplandian</HI> &amp; me. Wherfore fear not to vtter your mind vnto me, otherwise I wil from henceforth haue you in a iealousie, for that you haue already done, or yet would doe. Madame (said y<SUP>e</SUP> quéene) rather thē you should do so, I wil declare to you y<SUP>e</SUP> secretest thing I know. The knight (said she) wherof you speak, (I know not by what means) hath so captiued my mind, y<SUP>t</SUP> I féel y<SUP>e</SUP> thing in my self which I neuer thought could haue happened to me. And as they y<SUP>t</SUP> are molested with a cōtinual ague, do find y<SUP>e</SUP> tast of water better thē y<SUP>e</SUP> hope of life to thē: so I likewise, y<SUP>e</SUP> was accustomed not only to cōtemn the force of loue, but blame al such as yéeld to his might, (estéeming their estate rather voluntary then forcible) finde my selfe so much surprised, y<SUP>t</SUP> if God help me not, I am in the greatest danger y<SUP>t</SUP> euer poore woman was. What (said the princesse) think you my lord <HI>Norandel</HI> is of so hard a heart, and little courtesie, as
<PB REF="108"/> that hee would disdaine the loue of so faire and comely a Lady as you are? Doe you perceiue by him, that his mind is placed else∣where? No madame (saied she) but to the contrary, hee protested to be wholly mine, without any further aduantage, then that I haue accepted him for my knight. Truly (saied <HI>Leonorine</HI>) I am glad thereof, and if you had done otherwise, he might surely haue complained, and you much more to haue refused so great a good, when it is offered without dissimulation: else if it bée otherwise, it is no good, but rather a curse. I am of this opinion (saied shee) that my lord <HI>Norandel</HI> would rather die a thousand deathes then beare that mind: Wherefore determine I pray you to vse him well, assuring you, that I will not faile to succour you in what I may, and will doe for you as you haue done for mée. So long they talked together, that the Emperour and his company risen from the table, came to sée the ladies. Neuerthelesse, neither the Prin∣cesse nor Quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> could haue the meanes to entertaine their friends, but onely with a looke, whereby (their hearts pan∣ting in their bellies) were some what eased: when night appro∣ching, euery man withdrewe him to his rest, but when Quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> found her selfe alone, and in her bed, she began to think vpon the spéeches that <HI>Norandel</HI> vsed vnto her, sometimes deter∣mining to assaie, if by any meanes shee could driue the same out of hir mind, and then presently changed thoughts, and saied vnto her selfe: Alas, was there euer greater constancy in a woman, then that I alwaies had vntill this time? Must I nowe of force yéeld vp the fort, that against so many hard assaults I held inuin∣cible? Alas, I nowe perceiue it is of force, wherefore it is better presently to séeke for remedy, then to consume thus secretly as I doe. But what? if I chaunce in this sort to yéeld vnto mine own desire, (poore soule that I am) then doe I manifestly perceiue the danger wherein I fall, and the thraldome that I bring my selfe into, from whence while I liue, I shall neuer escape. Wherefore it were far better for mée to bridle mine owne affection, and com∣mand that which commandeth me, then do that which hereafter I might repent. With that shee held her peace, and tourning on each side, like one not well at ease in body nor in mind, she had no
<PB REF="108"/> sooner resolued one thing, but presentlye dissolued it againe, so great was her inconstancy therein. Neuerthelesse, hauing well debated with her selfe al the pleasures or displeasures that might cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e thereby: In the end, with a lowd voice shee vttered these words: I knowe not what may come to passe, but Loue promi∣seth me great things: Wherefore if the worst fall out, and that from henceforth I forget my selfe, hee shall beare the blame, and not I, that will doe nothing but vnder his protection: In which opinion, she fel asléepe, and the next day <HI>Norandel</HI> and she finding meanes to talke together, they confirmed their loue in such sort, that they determined to vse the same more by wisedome, then by passion: which those that are in like case, ought to follow, there∣by to attaine vnto the point of their desired ioyes, which in times past before, was commonly called the gracious gifte of Mercy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP-XLIIII. How Vrganda declared vnto the Emperour the signification of the Prophesie that was found in the tombe, and of two dragons that carried her with king Armato and Melie vp into the aire, and set them in the middle of the citty of Tesifant.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OV heard before howe <HI>Carmelle</HI> in her ship, shewed the Emperour the tombe that <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> had conquered in the Rocke of the En∣chauntresse with the image of Iupiter, and the Prophesie he held within his hand, which the Emperour remembred so well, that hee neuer ceased to thinke thereon. Whereby, the next day after the arriuall of that noble company in the citty of Con∣stantinople, he calling to mind that there could no person be foūd in all the world better able to resolue his doubt, then <HI>Vrganda</HI> was, caused her to goe into the closet, where the Emperesse with the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> Quéene <HI>Minoresse,</HI> and no more, stayed for her: they fiue being together, the Emperor caused the image
<PB REF="109"/> of <HI>Iupiter</HI> to be brought thither: which done, he said vnto <HI>Vrgan∣da:</HI> Madame, I pray you doe me so much pleasure as to declare (if it be possible) what are the meaning of the letters that this I∣mage holdeth. With that <HI>Vrganda</HI> read it, and hauing conside∣red thereof, she said vnto the Emperour: My lord, the great knowledge and skill that this Idol hath fore showen shall in time to come be lost, is alreadie happened: for as you know, the pow∣er of <HI>Iupiter</HI> and of other gods, hath béen suppressed and abolished by the comming of Iesus Christ: and as touching these wordes, The bondslaue of the bond of slauerie shall be buried here, and life restored by him that suffered death. These are hard and obscure tearmes, yet will I declare them to your Grace as well as pos∣sibly I may. With that <HI>Leonorine</HI> and quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> thought she would haue spoken of the knight <HI>Esplandian</HI> that had béen put into a Cedar chest, as you heard before: wherewith they béeing surprised with a deadly feare, began to behold each other in most pitifull manner: which <HI>Vrganda</HI> well perceiuing, intending to ease their mindes, continued her discourse in this manner: My lord (said shée) this prophecie was written concerning <HI>Matrodo</HI> lord of the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> who as you knowe was alwaies a Pagan till his latter day that he became a Christian, whereby long time he continued a bondslaue of the bond of slaue∣rie: for such ought the sea of Idolatrie to be named: but <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> perceiuing his repentance, suffered him to be buried in the hermitage, where as yet <HI>Carmelles</HI> father doth remaine: who since that time hath so much honoured the giants body, that shée hath buried his bones within the Cedar chest, y<SUP>t</SUP> you madam (said she to <HI>Leonorine</HI>) if you do remember, gaue vnto her: &amp; touching these lines which containe these words, <HI>That life shal be restored by him that suffered death:</HI> that is likewise to be vnderstood of him, for that loosing this transitorie life, he hath obtained the eternall in <HI>Abrahams</HI> bosome: so great grace hath he receiued at y<SUP>e</SUP> hands of God by the merit of his sonnes passion, in whome he did be∣léeue, as I said before: &amp; so my lord (said she) you haue heard what I can say as touching this strange prophecie. I but (said the Em∣perour) what meanes the rest? My lord (said she) I can tell you
<PB REF="109"/> no more of it than can my lady your daughter or quéene <HI>Mino∣resse,</HI> but so much can I assure you, that in short time you shall sée it come to passe: and if in any point it concerneth you, the best is it will all fall out to greater good of your soule, than to any power or worldly glory: wherwith for this present I pray you content your selfe. I truly (said the Emperor) &amp; so will I alwaies do: for so my soule be well I estéeme not the misery of torments of my bodie. And with that he left <HI>Vrganda</HI> with the Empresse, &amp; went into the hall, where great number of knights &amp; gentlemen staied for him: with whome hée passed the rest of the day in all pleasant delightes: meane time fortune by little and little began to play her part, and to spread the nets wherewith she meant to inclose that troupe, thereby to worke the enuie and great tribulations that afterward fell vpon them: the beginning whereof was such as you shall here. About a mile without the citie, the Emperor had built a sumptuous pallace, called <HI>Vaelbeniatnof,</HI> as like to that of <HI>Apollidon</HI> in y<SUP>e</SUP> firme Isle as well could be deuised: which place was compassed with a parke furnished with all things requisite for mans delight, whither hée meant to lead the ladies, with <HI>Esplandian</HI> and his companie, as also king <HI>Armato,</HI> to feast them in the same, and for that purpose within thrée daies after their arriuall, they departed from the citie of Constantinople, and went to Vaelbeniatnof, going into the parke, wherein they found the hunters, and at their first entrance a great Hart was singled out, which in the end after long chace was killed almost before the ladies: &amp; going further, they espied a bore so fiercely hunted by dogs, y<SUP>t</SUP> they made him turn, &amp; with his tuskes stroke y<SUP>e</SUP> dogs, y<SUP>t</SUP> none durst set vpon him: but at the last one of the hunters strake him in the throat, &amp; so he died: so long this sport endured, y<SUP>e</SUP> supper time drew on, wherfore the lords &amp; ladies entring into the palace found the tables couered, &amp; sitting downe, were serued in most sumptuous maner: &amp; hauing supped, they began to daunce, which continued till midnight, minding y<SUP>e</SUP> next day to begin their sport againe: but fortune minding to beare a part, did so trouble the feast y<SUP>t</SUP> she gaue them well to vnderstand, how she can worke in all things at her pleasure: for the next day about euening the
<PB REF="110"/> knights and ladies being in the Parke, some talking with those to whom they bare affection, and cōtenting their mind with such deuises as loue to passe the time in pleasure, put into their heads, others running about and taking pleasure to gather floures, and doe as most delighted them. <HI>Melie</HI> (from whō till then they could not heare one word) went vnto <HI>Vrganda,</HI> &amp; before them all spake vnto her and said: Madame, I maruell (if it be so that your lear∣ning and skill be such as is reported) why you make no sport vnto this company. <HI>Melie</HI> (said <HI>Vrganda</HI>) where you are present I wil not vndertake to doe it before you, but you should rather doe it, being well assured, that the Emperour would bee thankfull for the same. If it pleased him (said she) I am content, vpon conditi∣on, that after me you do the like, or better if you can. Truly (said the Emperour) it is but reason: and I pray you both to doe it. My lord (said <HI>Melie</HI>) then command <HI>Vrganda</HI> to lend mée a booke that I was wont to haue, whereon the picture of <HI>Medea,</HI> (&amp; her name written ouer it) dooth stand, then shall you beholde some of mine art, and if <HI>Vrganda</HI> neuer knew it before, she may learne it now of me. In good faith (said <HI>Vrganda</HI>) that wil I not deny you: with that she called one of her Gentlewomen, willing her to fetch the booke: meane time <HI>Melie</HI> tooke king <HI>Armato</HI> by the hande, and making as though she would speake a word with him, they wal∣ked a while together, then they sat them downe hard by the place where the empresse and the ladies were talking with ech other, and staying til the thing <HI>Melie</HI> had requested, were brought the∣ther, which not long after <HI>Vrgandas</HI> Gentlewoman brought vn∣to her, she hauing it in her hand opened the booke, and then began to read, making certaine signes with her eies lifted vp to heauen and calling <HI>Vrganda,</HI> praied her to come thether, saying she shold sée y<SUP>t</SUP> shee neuer had séene before. <HI>Vrganda</HI> not doubting any trea∣son by <HI>Melie</HI> prepared, went and sat downe by her, and next her king <HI>Armato,</HI> so that she sat betwéene <HI>Melie</HI> and him, where <HI>Me∣lie</HI> began to turne the booke, shewing them certaine prophesies, and other strange deuises, which continued not long but the aire began to be couered with a round blacke cloud, and there with it séemed so darke, that they could not sée each other, at the last the
<PB REF="110"/> cloud opened, and they beheld two horrible dragons comming downe out of the cloud that drewe a waggon, and staied right be∣fore <HI>Vrganda,</HI> who by <HI>Armato</HI> and <HI>Melie</HI> was so straitly embra∣ced, that whether shee would or not they thurst her in, and they after her. Wherwith the dragons séeing their waggon charged, flewe vp into the aire, and carried them away, <HI>Vrganda</HI> crying for helpe, but all in vaine: for in lesse than the twinckling of an eye she was out of sight: wherwith there was such noise among the company, that <HI>Esplandian, Talanque, Ambor, Manely,</HI> and the rest of the knights that came thither with her, sware neuer to rest aboue one night in a place before they found her out: so that the same day taking their leaues, both of the Emperor and others that by them were left in sorrow, they entred againe into the great serpent, but before <HI>Esplandian</HI> went, he spake vnto the princes <HI>Leonorine,</HI> beséeching her not to take in euill part his en∣terprise taken in hand for the loue of her, to whome he found him selfe so much beholding, promising her that presently (hauing found <HI>Vrganda</HI>) hée would returne againe. My good friend (said shée) me thinkes you should doe this at better leysour, and not in so great hast as now you doe: yet am I well content to doe as pleaseth you: but forget not I pray you (said shée) to returne a∣gaine as you haue promised. Which <HI>Esplandian</HI> vowed vpon his faith: meane time <HI>Norandel</HI> and quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> (as much grée∣ued as might be) knewe not what countenance to holde, hauing their hearts so seased with care, that the Quéene was constrai∣ned to withdrawe her selfe into her chamber, and lay vpon her bedde, shutting the doore: whereby <HI>Norandel</HI> had no meanes to take his leaue, but imbarked himselfe, charged with an infinite number of gréefes and sorrowes: with that the great serpent be∣gan of it selfe to set forward, and within two daies after arriued at the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLV. How the two Dragons set Vrganda, Melie, and king Armato in the middle of the cittie of Tesifant, and of the great armie that Armato prepared to enter into Greece.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Dragons bearing <HI>Vrganda, Melie,</HI> and king <HI>Armato</HI> in the aire, flewe so swiftly, that before day they were right ouer the citie of Tesifante, where they set downe their charge: that done, they flewe away, and neuer were séene againe: king <HI>Arma∣to</HI> was excéeding glad when he perceiued himselfe to be in place whereas he might commaund, and went vnto his pallace, where finding the guard, he made himselfe knowen vnto them, that presently went to ad∣uertise the prince <HI>Alphorax,</HI> who much abashed at those newes, start out of his bed, and casting a furred gowne vpon his shoul∣ders, ranne to imbrace his father, who séemed to be so changed, not onely because his beard was longer than he vsed, but by rea∣son of the great gréefe and melancholly he had so long endured, that the prince began to wéepe, and say vnto him: My Lord, you are more than heartily welcome, for Gods cause I beséech you tell vs how fortune hath béene so much your friend to deliuer you out of the misery wherein you haue continued so long, to my no little griefe. Sonne (said he) <HI>Melie</HI> can tell you better than my selfe, for she is the only meanes of my good hap, and hath brought with her <HI>Vrganda discogneue,</HI> (of whome heretofore you haue heard.) And as he left speaking, <HI>Melie</HI> and <HI>Vrganda</HI> entred into the hall, wherewith the rumor of the kings returne was so great within the Citie, that all the people ranne vnto the palace for to sée him, being as glad of his arriuall, as <HI>Vrganda</HI> sorry to sée her selfe in such a place, and that which gréeued her more, was that <HI>Melie</HI> in presence of them all, spake vnto her and said: <HI>Vrganda,</HI> two things mooue me to saue thy life: the one, for that in my cap∣tiuitie
<PB REF="111"/> thou hast not once suffered an euill word to be vsed to me, neither permitted that any man should doe mee harme: the other because I certainly know that king <HI>Armato</HI> hath by thy means receiued all the good intertainement he had, during his hard im∣prisonment. Neuerthelesse, the mischiefe thou hast procured vn∣to this country (being the only cause the Christians entered into the same) is sufficient to make thée indure perpetuall imprison∣ment: wherein by mine art I will so straightly inclose thée, that thy Art shal nought auaile thée euer so get forth. But although that sentence might well abash <HI>Vrganda,</HI> yet shee shewed such constancy, y<SUP>t</SUP> she neuer changed colour, determining w<SUP>t</SUP> her selfe to indure whatsoeuer should fal out, wherfore she said vnto <HI>Melie:</HI> Madame, you may do with me as pleaseth you, but in reason you ought not to vse me otherwise then you your selfe were vsed whē I had the like authority ouer you, as you haue now of me, other∣wise you shal do wrong both to your selfe &amp; me: To me, y<SUP>t</SUP> am olde &amp; ancient, putting me in prison, wherewith you threaten me, (not hauing offended you,) &amp; to your selfe, in preferring cruelty before the curtesie y<SUP>t</SUP> hath ben found in you: whereto <HI>Melie</HI> answered hir not a word, but commanded her to be shut into a great tower stā∣ding in the midst of y<SUP>e</SUP> citty, ouer y<SUP>e</SUP> which she wrought such coniu∣rations, y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Vrganda</HI> knew without Gods help, it would be impos∣sible for her euer to come forth: yet she liued in hope, considring y<SUP>e</SUP> mutability of fortune, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> king <HI>Armato</HI> himselfe had ben casually deliuered, who continued certaine daies in his great Citty of Tesifant, without making any shew to bee reuenged. But in the end he sent Embassadours to all the Princes in the East y<SUP>t</SUP> were his allies and confederates, desiring them to enter into arms, not onely to driue the Christians out of Galatia, Alfarin, and other places that they had vsurped in his countrey, but to destroy Con∣stantinople with all the Christian monarch, and therefore wrote a letter vnto them, the contents whereof doe follow.</P>
<P><HI>Armato,</HI> by the prouidence of our immortall gods, called to the gouernment of the puissant country of Turky, the frontier &amp; Bulwark of al y<SUP>e</SUP> Pagan land, to all caitifes, kings, soldiors, ad∣mirals &amp; gouernors of y<SUP>e</SUP> countries scituated in y<SUP>e</SUP> east parts, sēdeth
<PB REF="112"/> gréeting, being returned out of prison, from whence we are now deliuered, I thought good to giue you to vnderstand, that not long since there is a knight come out of the South into the mar∣ches, descended (as men say) of the race of <HI>Brutus</HI> the Troiane, to whome for our iniustice (as it is verie likely) our gods haue giuen power to conquer the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> slaying <HI>Matroco</HI> and <HI>Frerion,</HI> two of the best Knightes in all the East parts: and which is worse (the number of the Christians increa∣sing more and more) they haue fought all meanes to destroy our holy lawe: which to preuent, we entred into armes, and hauing raised a mightie armie, thought to driue them out of our quar∣ters: but hauing long time continued siege before the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> and brought it to such extremitie, that they had no victuals to sustaine themselues, he of whome we were most in doubt, the first beginner of those warres, found meanes by the aid of a villaine named <HI>Frandalo</HI> (that sometime belonged vnto vs) to enter therein, and by subtiltie to take vs prisoners, in such sort, that our army being ouerthrowne, we remained prisoners in their handes, where they haue holden vs in straight kéeping almost for the space of a whole yéere togither: meane time our fortune continuing worse and worse, they haue by trea∣son seazed vpon the townes of Alfarin and Galatia, two of the best portes in all our Realme: which they had neuer taken in hand without the aide of the traiterous and disloyall Emperour of Constantinople: who for to aid and succour them, hath falsly broken the truce concluded betwéen vs, and raised so many men, that without your aides, we are in danger to fall into their hāds, a thing that would concerne you much, séeing we (as you know) are the frontire and rampart to you all. Wherefore in the name of all our gods, wee pray and desire you, that not onely for the safegard of our law, but for the profit and vtilitie of all the East countries, you will assemble your forces in so great number, that thereby we may driue these Christians out of our countrey, and conquer the Empire of Constantinople, euen to Fraunce, and the countries of great Brittaine, which will be both easie and profitable vnto vs. These letters written and the messengers
<PB REF="112"/> dispatched, they made such hast, y<SUP>t</SUP> before y<SUP>e</SUP> end of Iuly following, there were so many men assembled at the port of Tenedos, that the Christians had newes thereof, as hereafter you shall heare. One day among the rest as <HI>Belleris, Talanque,</HI> and <HI>Manely</HI> being issued out of the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> hoping to take some Turke in the way to Tesifant that might tel them news, not on∣ly of king <HI>Armato,</HI> but of <HI>Melie</HI> &amp; <HI>Vrganda,</HI> as day began to ap∣peare came vnto the aduenturous fountain, where they beheld y<SUP>e</SUP> pillers of brasse, y<SUP>e</SUP> pauillion, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> field bed y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Heliaxe</HI> had left there, with a great serpent lying therein, which presently began to run away, and the knights after, thinking to kill her, but their horses durst not go néere her, yet she began to complain and wéep as bit∣terly as a womā trauelling w<SUP>t</SUP> child. Wherewith there appeared four men wel mounted &amp; armed at al points, y<SUP>t</SUP> cried out and saied: Sir knights, depart frem hence &amp; trouble not our gentlewoman in this sort, or it shall cost you your liues. And scarse had they en∣ded their spéech, but they ran ech at other, y<SUP>e</SUP> strange knights brea∣king their speares in such maner vpon the Christians, y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Manely</HI> and his companions thought they had run against thē with long strawes. Yet could not one of thē couch his launce, but ran their course without once touching thē. Mean time, the serpent entred into a hole, and could no more be séene, &amp; as they turned their hor∣ses to run another course, the four knights would not abide, but flying away, cried vnto them and said: Sir knights, our Gentle∣woman is safe, for y<SUP>e</SUP> rest contēt your selues if you think good. Get you hence to al the deuils (said <HI>Talanque</HI>) and ill fortune might he haue y<SUP>t</SUP> followeth after you. With y<SUP>t</SUP> they thrée returned vnto the fountain, not without great laughing at their aduenture. And as they were before the pauillion, they perceiued a knight that wa∣tred his horse, to whō <HI>Belleris</HI> riding, asked him his name: What haue you to do therwith? (said he.) So much (said <HI>Belleris</HI>) that ei∣ther you shal tell me presently w<SUP>t</SUP> good wil, or els shal sight w<SUP>t</SUP> me. You shal faile in the one, but not in the other: for although you bée thrée, yet am I well content to prooue what the knights of great Brittaine can doe. Whē <HI>Talanque</HI> heard him speake so boldly, he could not refrain to say: By God sir knight, that shall you prooue
<PB REF="113"/> without delay, &amp; setting spurs to his horse, ran fiercely against the other that refused him not, but strake him so sure, y<SUP>t</SUP> he ouerthrew him to y<SUP>e</SUP> ground. Which <HI>Manely</HI> wondring at, set forward to re∣uēge his friend: but if y<SUP>e</SUP> first sped ill, he sped no better, no more did <HI>Belleris:</HI> all thrée rising vp againe, ashamed at their fals, which minding to amend by dent of swords, the other knight fled along the wood, crying so lowd, that they might heare him saie: Sir knights, another time sit better on your horses, and trouble not your selues to follow me, if you meane not to lose your way. In Gods name (said <HI>Talanque</HI>) what may this mean, shall wée haue no better fortune all this day, I thinke wee are inchaunted. Let vs mount vpon our horses and follow after him, that wee may knowe whether God or all the diuels in hell haue determined to crosse vs in this iourny. Wherewith they mounted, determining to follow after y<SUP>e</SUP> other, but they heard a lamentable voice, wher∣fore they staied to sée what it might bee. With that they espied a woman with her head vndrest, crying out for helpe: And after her ran a lion ready to deuour her: whereat they being mooued with compassion, thought to step betwéen thē, but the lion began so horribly to rore, y<SUP>t</SUP> the horses stricken with fear, bare their ma∣sters aboue two long bows shot from thence: meane time, y<SUP>e</SUP> wo∣man and the lion vanished away, whereat <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Manely</HI> more abashed then before, asked <HI>Belleris</HI> if euer hee heard of such aduētures. In good faith (said he) those y<SUP>e</SUP> are desirous to sée strāge things, must repaire vnto this fountaine: For there are manie (&amp; such as yet you haue not séene) y<SUP>e</SUP> wonder it is to hear, &amp; wil you know how it commeth to passe? <HI>Melie</HI> had deuised thē long time since, wherfore it is not to be maruelled. No more I doe not (said <HI>Manely:</HI>) neuertheles, were it not for y<SUP>e</SUP> enterprise we now haue takē in hand, by the faith of a knight (said he) I would not depart from hence before I had séene them all. That shall bée at another time (said <HI>Belleris:</HI>) let vs now kéepe on our way, y<SUP>t</SUP> wee be not dis∣couered. With y<SUP>t</SUP> they held on the left hand, alwaies riding tow∣ard the citty of Tesifant: &amp; hauing ridden about fiue miles space, they met ten men on horseback all vnarmed, leading two Gen∣tlewomen, one of them being somewhat faire and well apparel∣led.
<PB REF="113"/> But the ten men were in so great fear, y<SUP>e</SUP> leauing the Gentle∣women, they ran and saued thēselues not being pursued, for the thrée knights staied w<SUP>t</SUP> the gentlewomen, of whom they hoped to hear such news as they desired. And in effect, after they had som∣what assured them, they asked them what news of king <HI>Armato,</HI> and whether he were stil prisoner. My lords (said the eldest Gen∣tlewoman) it is not long since hee escaped out of the Christians hands, and is returned vnto Tesifant with <HI>Melie,</HI> that hath shut <HI>Vrganda</HI> in a tower, from whence she shal neuer depart without her leaue. That is good newes for vs then (said <HI>Belleris:</HI>) and what hath king <HI>Armato</HI> done since his returne? Doth he not (saied he) meane to bee reuenged on them that kept him prisoner so long? I truly (said she) for all the kings, Souldans, Cailiffes, and admi∣rals of the Pagan law, haue promised him to arriue at Constan∣tinople, and to destroy all Christendome. And as it is saied, the most part of them are already arriued in the isle of Tenedos. In good faith said <HI>Belleris</HI> to his companions,) considering the spée∣ches of these Gentlewomen, I am of this opinion, that we med∣dle no longer with them, but returne vnto our hold. Wherevn∣to they both agréed, and letting the Gentlewomen depart, made so great hast, that about two houres after sunnesetting they ar∣riued at the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> where they shewed their companions what aduentures they found in the aduenturous fountaine. And at our departure from thence (said they) we found tenne men on horsebacke leading two Gentlewomen, by whom wee haue for certaine vnderstood, that <HI>Vrganda</HI> is straightly shut vp in one of the towers of Tesifant, and so inchaunted therein by <HI>Melies</HI> coniurations, that she is like neuer to come forth, as al∣so that the Pagan kings assemble themselues together in the isle of Tenedos, to ouerrun the Emperour of Constantinople, and all the Christians countrey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVI. How the Pirate Crescelin, nephew to the admiral Tartary, brought certaine newes to Esplandian of the great army that the lordes of the east parts prepared to come vnto Constantinople.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He report that <HI>Belleris, Talanque,</HI> and <HI>Manely,</HI> vsed to their companions as touching the great preparation the Pa∣gans made to inuade the Empyre of Constantinople and all Christendome, caused them to thinke thereon, in such sort, y<SUP>t</SUP> they tooke counsell to determine among themselues, whether it were better for thē to augment the garrisons of the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> Alfarin, and Galatia, or goe to Constantinople to aide the Emperour. And as they were in debating of the matter, <HI>Crescelin</HI> nephewe to the Admirall of Gréece, (that not long before had stollen tenne Gallies from the Emperour to roue vpon the sea) came to aduertise the Knights, that as he sailed into Phrigia, he had discouered in the isle of Te∣nedos, so many Gallies, Foistes, and other vessels, of the ene∣mies, that the sea séemed couered therewith, who without doubt assembled to ouerrun the Emperour &amp; destroy all Christendome: wherefore (said he) I thought to let you vnderstand the same, not onely because you might prouide for them, but also to desire your fauours to entreate the Emperour in my behalfe: assuring you, that if hee pardon the offence I haue committed against his maiesty, I will frō henceforth do him so good seruice, that he shall like it well. My lord <HI>Cresceline</HI> (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) I haue alwaies heard y<SUP>e</SUP> emperor reported to be one of the best princes liuing in y<SUP>e</SUP> world, &amp; most easie to bée appeased, whē w<SUP>t</SUP> reason men reconcile themselues vnto him: wherefore I am assured, y<SUP>t</SUP> if he know you mean faithfully to serue him as you protest, y<SUP>t</SUP> he wil not only for∣get your fault, but do you much more good thē to others of his mē:
<PB REF="114"/> and the better to incite him thereunto, I am of this opinion, that with your ships you presently returne to the goulfe <HI>Propontide,</HI> &amp; there (if it be possible) shall find the means to take some Turkish gally, thereby to know the truth of their intent: and if you will, <HI>Belleris</HI> shall go with you, and according to your reports, we will determine what were best for vs to do, wherevnto the pirat wil∣lingly condiscended: so that the same day he put to sea, and with <HI>Belleris</HI> they coasted the countrey of Thrace vnto Solombre, where staying secretly at the entrie of the goulfe, they continu∣ed certaine daies to bring their enterprise to passe: meane time <HI>Esplandian</HI> not being idle, &amp; thinking vpon the newes that <HI>Cres∣celin</HI> brought, was of aduise that <HI>Frandalo</HI> &amp; all the other knights of great Brittain should returne to Constantinople to aid y<SUP>e</SUP> Em∣peror (which he desired them to do:) &amp; I (said he) with the king of Denmarke, <HI>Gandalin,</HI> and <HI>Enil,</HI> with the garrison of this place, will stay the returne of those that are gone to Tenedos, and ha∣uing spoken with them, either we will remaine here still, or pre∣sently follow you. Estéeme I pray you, if this opinion of <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> were liked of by <HI>Norandel,</HI> for that from the day he left quéen <HI>Minoresse,</HI> he had not shewen a pleasant countenance, but was so melancholly that euery man wondred thereat: and although the rest were not infected with the like disease, yet was there none that started backe, but all agréed to <HI>Esplandians</HI> mind: wher∣vpon without long delay, they imbarked themselues with so good a wind, that the seuenth day after they arriued at Constantino∣ple, whereof the Emperour being aduertised was excéeding glad, going to méet them at the hauen: and hauing embraced them one by one, not séeing <HI>Esplandian</HI> in their company, hee asked where they left him: with that the knights told him what intelligence they had receiued by <HI>Crescelins</HI> means from out of Asia, the great danger prepared against him by the kings of the East, how hée and <HI>Belleris</HI> were returned to sée the countenance of the enemie, and to know more certaine newes: and lastly, what the occasion was why <HI>Esplandian</HI> stayed behind in the castle <HI>La montaigne de∣fendu,</HI> with the king of Denmarke, <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil.</HI> The Em∣perour hearing these newes, was much abashed, yet like a stout
<PB REF="115"/> and valiant prince dissembled what he thought, and not long af∣ter (minding to preuent all inconueniences) in all hast caused Constantinople and his other townes, places, and hauens of the sea, to be prouided of victuals and munition as hée thought mée∣test for them: meane time sending forth his captaines through∣out all his Empire, to assemble men in all places, that might be readie when occasion serued. Thus did the Emperour take care to prouide for his affaires: and <HI>Norandel</HI> meane time to gouerne <HI>Minoresse,</HI> who minding to trie him like gold within the fornace, one day among the rest shewed him a harder countenance than vsually she did, faining she had receiued newes that he loued a la∣die in great Brittain: wherein <HI>Norandel</HI> by all meanes sought to excuse himselfe: but the more he séemed constant, so much more did the Quéene make him beléeue shée thought the worse of him: wherewith he was in such perplexitie, that hee could not choose but say: In faith madame, as farre as I perceiue, you meane to end my daies, for the wrong you do me is so great, that it can not well be iudged but by such as know your crueltie: and yet the af∣fection I beare you is so great, that neither I nor any other can well expresse the same, if presently they doe not shew the beauty and perfection wherewith nature hath adorned you. Wherefore estranging me from your wonted fauour, I perceiue my life be∣gin to shorten, wherewith I am not grieued, were it not, that dying, I should loose the meanes to doe you seruice, but not the benefite of loyaltie: for whether I liue or die, the same shall still accompanie my soule vnto the place of rest. Which wordes when <HI>Norandel</HI> had vttered, the tears trickled down his chéekes. Whereat Quéene <HI>Minoresse</HI> tooke such pitie, that forgetting her dissimulation, with a smiling countenance shée answered him and said: My good friend, I now beléeue you well, and therefore I pray you pardon my indiscretion: for so it is, that this that I haue done, hath béene onely to auoid the meanes that should pro∣cure you to attempt the same. Now I well perceiue your con∣stancie (according to my counsell at your last departure hence) remember I beséech you how necessarie dissimulation is to such as are infected with the like disease: I meane, it should not bée
<PB REF="115"/> betwéene vs two, but before the world that they perceiue it not. Madame (said <HI>Norandel</HI>) I will not if I may offend your Grace, knowing mine owne constancie so well, that impossible it were for me to withdrawe my loue from you, as also not to serue and honour you, yea though you should reward mée with the grea∣test cruelties that all such as loue &amp; are not loued, might endure. While they thus deuised togither, the Princesse <HI>Leonorine</HI> (that serued them as a watch) entertained <HI>Frandalo</HI> and the rest, and making as if she knewe not the cause of <HI>Esplandians</HI> returne to Constantinople, shée asked it of them, faining to be displeased at the same, but they excused him: in like sort they did vnto the em∣perour, as you heard before.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVII. How Crescelin and Belleris returned to the castle La montaigne de∣fendu, with a ship that they had taken from the Turks, by whome they vnderstood the enemies pretence.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Ot long after that <HI>Crescelin</HI> and <HI>Belle∣ris</HI> departed from the castle <HI>La montaign defendu,</HI> sayling as secretly as they could along the coast of Phrigia, fortune fauoured them so well, that a Brigan∣dine sayling to Tenedos, charged with Turkes, fell into their hands, whereof they left but foure aliue: by whom they certainely vnderstood, that the armie of the Princes of the East was to depart from thence within a mo∣neth or sixe wéekes after at the furthest, and saile to Constanti∣nople, which they hoped easily to surprise, hauing by their es∣pials had intelligence that the Emperour made no preparation to withstand them. Which hauing heard, they returned with∣out longer stay to giue aduise vnto <HI>Esplandian,</HI> who fearing that the Emperour would not be able to withstand their might, de∣termined to vse the ayde of all his feiendes, minding to send
<PB REF="116"/> <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> vnto them, with letters to the same effect: spe∣cially to his vncle the Emperour of Rome, to whome hée wrote as followeth.</P>
<P>My lord, the danger I sée prepared against all Christendome, constraineth me to send this messenger vnto you, by whome at large your Grace may vnderstand how great and puissant an ar∣mie all the Kings and Potentates of the East (enemies of our faith) haue lately raised, by the persuasion of <HI>Armato</HI> king of Turkie, therwith to ouer-runne not only the Empire of Greece, but all the land of Christendome, and wholly to extinguish our faith and holy lawe. And for that all those of whome you hold the place, haue alwaies béene the true defenders of the Christian faith, as also that the case toucheth you so néere, I am of this ad∣uise (my lord) that you ought to spare neither mony nor men, but to assemble your forces in all hast, and prepare your vessels to aid and succour the good prince, who is the frontier (as you knowe) both vnto you and all the potentates that hold the law of Christ. I write the like vnto the king my father, and to the most part of all the Christian Lordes, to whome I send <HI>Gandalin.</HI> And for that <HI>Enil</HI> hath in charge to certifie your grace by word of mouth, what it shall please you to demand, I will not trouble you with many lines, beséeching you to giue credit vnto him, as to my selfe. The like he wrote to the king of Sardaigne: which two messages <HI>Enil</HI> had in charge: to whome he gaue ample instructi∣ons and remembrances of all the aduertisements and secret in∣telligences he had receiued from the Turkish coast: not onely of the number of men both on horse and foot; but also of the multi∣tude of their vessels and other warlike instruments: commaun∣ding <HI>Gandalin</HI> to goe with him till he came vnto Cicilia, where he should prouide shipping to saile into great Brittaine to <HI>Ama∣dis</HI> his father, and from thence to France vnto king <HI>Perion,</HI> then to Sobradise to <HI>Galaor,</HI> likewise to king <HI>Bruneau,</HI> to <HI>Quedragant, Dragonis,</HI> and <HI>Gosquilant:</HI> to whome he sent like seuerall letters: <HI>Gandalin</HI> carrying them likewise the same instructions that <HI>Enil</HI> had vnto the Emperour, commaunding them expresly to assure them all, that he would not depart from the castle <HI>La montaigne
<PB REF="116"/> defendu,</HI> before their arriuall there, but meant to kéepe it while breath was in his body. <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> had so good and pros∣perous a weather, that in lesse than fiftéene daies after their de∣parture, they passed the countrey of Messine, and landed at Sa∣ragource, where <HI>Gandalin</HI> hired a Brigandine to execute his charge. And to the end you may vnderstand what effect their messages did worke, I will leaue <HI>Gandalin</HI> trauersing the Medi∣teranean Sea, and entring into the Ocean, and speake of <HI>Enil</HI> that arriued at Ostre, where as then he found the Emperour ac∣companied with king <HI>Florestan,</HI> deuising onely of haukes and houndes: but when they espied <HI>Enil,</HI> presuming he brought some ill newes, they asked him where hée left <HI>Esplandian: Enil</HI> know∣ing how to behaue himselfe, kissed the letters, and gaue one to the Emperour, the other to the king of Sardaigne: which hauing read, and perceiuing them to be of credit, tooke him apart where hee discouered vnto them all you heard before. With that the Emperour leauing <HI>Enil</HI> with king <HI>Florestan,</HI> went vnto the gentlemen and knights that then were present, and said vnto them: My friends, wée must all to the warres: my nephew <HI>Es∣plandian</HI> hath aduertised me (by this gentleman expressely sent vnto me) that the king of Turkie and all his allies are in armes, and haue raised a mighty armie to assaile my brother y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperor of Constantinople: but I vow to God (if he giue me life &amp; helpe) that before the moneth of September next ensuing, I will be there with such a force, that I will make him twice repent how hee so rashly dooth assaile, and learne him to defend himselfe. Wherefore let euery man bée ready, for I will goe my selfe in person: and calling king <HI>Florestan</HI> he asked him if hee would goe with him: My lord (said he) to morrow I will send to all my ports &amp; hauens, that all the ships of war that can be found may be in a readines: meane time I will in all parts assemble men to doe as my nephew <HI>Esplandian</HI> hath required. My Lord (said <HI>Enil</HI>) my lord <HI>Esplandian</HI> hath written by <HI>Gandalin</HI> to king <HI>Amadis</HI> and other of his friends, whome he hath desired to ioyne with you, so y<SUP>t</SUP> I hope about one time all your armies wil be ready, &amp; that wiihout long staying for each other, you will assemble all togither. Truly (said
<PB REF="117"/> king <HI>Florestan</HI> it was well deuised. With that diuers captaines were dispatched into sundry places to giue order for their men, and to ballace, rigge, and prepare vessels for their voiage into the East. <HI>Gandalin</HI> on the other side coasting the Isles of Ma∣iorque and Minorque, leauing Guinea and Barbarie, passed the straits of Gibraltar, and had so good a wind, that in fewe daies without staying in Spaine, hée arriued in great Brittain with king <HI>Amadis,</HI> who as then continued in London, and presented him with the letter that <HI>Esplandian</HI> sent, shewing him likewise his charge by word of mouth, the good and euill aduentures that he had had since he departed from Myrefleur, and among the rest the ouerthrowe of the Turkish armie on the sea, the taking of king <HI>Armato,</HI> the occasion why the siege rose vp before the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> the arriuall of <HI>Gastilles,</HI> the taking of Al∣farin, and of the captaine of Tesifant, the surprising of Galatia, the losse of <HI>Vrganda:</HI> and lastly all what you haue read at large in the chapters going before. And to the end my lord (said he) that order may be had to preuent the inconuenience he foreséeth to be prepared against all Christendome (if it be not succoured) he hath expresly willed me to shew you, that he hath had certaine intelli∣gence, that all the kings of the East parts haue sworne and pro∣mised, togither to ouerrunne all Christendome: which is verie likely, considering the great preparations and assembly of men they haue alreadie made in the Isle of Tenedos: which is such, that as our spies report, they are at least sixe hundred sayle of shippes, and about foure or fiue hundred thousand men. God will helpe vs if it pleaseth him, said king <HI>Amadis,</HI> for my part, I will doe what possible I may, and will like wise aduertise king <HI>Pe∣rion</HI> my father and my brother <HI>Galaor.</HI> My lord (said <HI>Gandalin</HI>) I haue also charge to trauaile vnto them, and likewise vnto <HI>Gas∣quillan, Don Bruneau, Quedragant,</HI> and others, to whome <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> hath written in like sort as he hath done to you, and hath ex∣presly giuen me in charge to sée king <HI>Luisart,</HI> and doe his humble commendations vnto him. It is great reason (said the king:) ne∣uerthelesse I am of this opinion, that before my mother y<SUP>e</SUP> quéene you doe not once declare the occasion of your comming, but giue
<PB REF="117"/> her to vnderstand that all is well, but not vnto the king, if you find him alone: for he is a man (as euery one well knoweth) to take all things with patience as they shall fall out: and because my sonnes affaires require no delay, I pray you <HI>Gandalin</HI> after you haue refreshed your selfe a day or two, goe on your iourney as you haue in charge. So <HI>Gandalin</HI> that day remained there, du∣ring which time Quéene <HI>Oriane</HI> talked long with him: the next day he departed to sée King <HI>Luisart</HI> and Quéene <HI>Brisenne</HI> at Mire∣fleur, who knowing he came of message from <HI>Esplandian,</HI> were excéeding glad: the Quéene although shée were wise and verie aged, yet could not change her womans nature, but before the king spake any word asked him for her sonne: but <HI>Gandalin</HI> (ac∣customed readily to deuise excuses, as hée had béen instructed by king <HI>Amadis</HI>) tolde her that he had left him in the firme Isle not well at ease by reason of his long trauell, but not so ill (said he) as that he could not haue taken paine to come hither &amp; sée you, but he feared least his sicknes would encrease: wherefore he thought it better for him to kéep his chamber a while, than to entertaine a long and enuious ague for a long space: which the quéene easily beléeued: and for the hope she had shortly to sée him, she made no account thereof: neuertheles, the same euening <HI>Gandalin</HI> tolde king <HI>Luisart</HI> all that you heard before, wisely excusing himselfe of the spéech he vsed before him vnto the Quéene, as king <HI>Amadis</HI> had giuen him charge: wherein king <HI>Luisart</HI> commended him, &amp; for the rest he promised to thinke theron while he trauailed vnto those with whome he had to doe. In this sort <HI>Gandalin</HI> being dis∣patched, returned to king <HI>Amadis,</HI> who in the mean time (persua∣ded by quéen <HI>Oriane</HI>) wrought a marriage for him, as you shall heare. You haue read in the beginning of our history of the serui∣ces the gentlewoman of Denmarke did for them, and the things wherein she &amp; <HI>Gandalin</HI> had béen exercised: wherefore it was rea∣son, that hauing béen partakers of their youthful toies, she should also tast some of their prosperous fortunes. Wherefore quéene <HI>Oriane</HI> moued king <HI>Amadis</HI> to make a marriage betwéen them two, but he thought the match vnfit, because the gentlewoman was already aged, &amp; <HI>Gandalin</HI> being yong and lusty: neuertheles,
<PB REF="118"/> as all women that are wise and of a quicke conceit, can bring their enterprises to effect, the Quéene found meanes to get the kings consent: wherby <HI>Gandalin</HI> was no sooner come frō Myre∣fleur but he took him aside, &amp; said vnto him: <HI>Gandalin,</HI> the quéene is desirous to haue you stay with vs, not only for the loue she know∣eth I beare vnto you, but also for the good shée wisheth you. And for this cause she would haue you marry with the gentlewoman of Denmarke, whome she loueth, &amp; will doe much both for her &amp; you, if you consent thereto: you know her long time since both to be wise, good, &amp; vertuous, and for my part I pray you and counsell you thereunto. <HI>Gandalin</HI> would gladly haue excused himselfe, and to say the truth, he was too yong for so old a match: neuerthelesse hauing from his infancie learned to confirme his will to y<SUP>e</SUP> of <HI>A∣madis,</HI> he was content to doe as pleased him: in such sort, y<SUP>t</SUP> in lesse than thrée daies after the marriage was celebrated and ended. Meane time king <HI>Amadis</HI> tooke the letters and instructions that <HI>Gandalin</HI> should carry to <HI>Gasquillan</HI> and king <HI>Bruneau,</HI> and sent them by a gentleman of his named <HI>Handro,</HI> cousin german to the Countesse of Flaunders, desiring them as much as possible they might to aide his sonne in his so good a cause: but the next weeke following <HI>Gandalin</HI> more affected to the seruice of <HI>Esplandian</HI> thā to court his wife, departed from thence to trauaile into Fraunce vnto king <HI>Perion,</HI> and from him to Sobradise to <HI>Galaor.</HI> Meane time king <HI>Amadis</HI> sent for all the pilots, masters, and mariners of his countrey that he could find, commending king <HI>Arban</HI> of Norgales, to take care for all things requisite for the enterprise &amp; charges of such a vsage, both for men and vessels. In this maner did the affaires touching these wars procéed through the greatest part of Europe, while all the kings in the East by little &amp; litle as∣sembled themselues togither, as you shall heare.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVIII. How the great citty of Constantinople was besieged by the princes of the East, and of the salies that were made by those of the citty to keepe them from the same.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He army of the Pagan kings daily assembling in the Isle of Tenedos, y<SUP>e</SUP> emperor mean time fortified his cit∣ty of Constantinople both with men &amp; victuals in y<SUP>e</SUP> best maner he could, cōmanding those y<SUP>t</SUP> had charge of his ar∣my by sea to cause all his vessels to come into the Hauen of the town, which he caused to be barred with a chaine, that on that side he might be out of danger. Thē hee sent diuers brigandines vnto Natolia, to discouer the Pagans army, and bring him certaine newes: Meane time, the countrey people reaped all their corn, and brought it to the citty. Within eight daies after the Brigan∣dines y<SUP>t</SUP> were sent forth, discouered in the straights of Hellespont the great fléet of the Turkes y<SUP>t</SUP> lay at Abides, where they stayed a certaine time to take in victuals and other munitions necessary for their ships. Whereof y<SUP>e</SUP> emperour being aduertised, caused his men to muster, giuing <HI>Frandalo</HI> charge of the dragon gate, so cal∣led, because y<SUP>t</SUP> at the foundation of the citty, when it was named Bisance, there was found a maruellous Dragon vnder the foun∣dation of y<SUP>e</SUP> gate, which dragon was bound chained, and norished, so long time, y<SUP>t</SUP> it was thought most strange. <HI>Norandel</HI> had charge of the gate called quiline, &amp; <HI>Gastiles</HI> his nephew of that called y<SUP>e</SUP> Well, so named of a great &amp; profound well that stoode hard by it. And causing the other gates to bee rampired vp, prouided for all things as a wise &amp; valiant captaine should do in such a case. With that a Grecian that had ben takē by the Turks, came into y<SUP>e</SUP> city, and assured thē for certaine y<SUP>t</SUP> the Soudan of Liquie was himselfe in person with king <HI>Armato,</HI> and almost all the kings of the east, hauing two hundred Gallies, as well great as small, fifty great ships, thirty mahoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and one &amp; twenty cafords, that are ships not much vnlike to gallies: besides thirtie foistes and diuers bri∣gandines,
<PB REF="119"/> barkes, galions and sciffes, wherein they had laid their victuals &amp; other munitions: and for their number of footmen, they might be about some thrée hundred and fifty thousand men, saying likewise, that <HI>Alphorax</HI> had the chéefe charge at sea, and <HI>Armato</HI> on land, and that their determination was neuer to depart from Constantinople, till they had destroied it, and from thence would go to Rome, &amp; further if they rould. The sixt day after, this great army (passing the gulfe of Propontide) came into the straights of Constantinople, entering in the great sea, where they remained during the siege, robbing all the countrey about, where first they staied a wéeke before they landed any of their men: meane time, certain gallies and small ships set forward to make an alarum in the hauen, from whence (to their great losse) they were repulsed, for y<SUP>e</SUP> sixe of the principallest of them were sunk in the sea. Neuer∣theles, the next day following they began to land, &amp; in great num∣bers thought to win the gate: there were many braue blows both with sword and speare giuen on both parts, and many a valiant man ended their daies, &amp; became meat to fishes. There y<SUP>e</SUP> knights of great Brittain shewed thēselues not to bée vnacquainted with such dangers, &amp; who so had beheld <HI>Norandel, Frandalo, Manely,</HI> &amp; <HI>Talanque</HI> repulse the enemy, y<SUP>t</SUP> thought to aduaunce themselues, might eastly iudge with what desire they fought. But what shuld I stand longer to describe this conflict? To conclude, y<SUP>e</SUP> gate was defended, &amp; the enemies repulsed from the same, yet their number was so great, y<SUP>e</SUP> notwithstanding the valour of the Emperours men, they landed &amp; lay within two bowes shot of the city, they of the city being forced to retire. The Pagans being on land, deui∣ded themselues into four parts, in such sort, y<SUP>t</SUP> the city was so well besieged, that not a man could enter or come forth without their leaue. Wherefore king <HI>Armato</HI> presently caused great number of ladders to bee prepared, the most part of them double, hoping before the wéeke were ended, to assault, take, spoile, and destroye the City. But they within slept neither night nor day, but made artificiall fires, with all other things requisite for such a charge. The Pagans staied not long to execute their purpose, so that vp∣on a munday in the morning, they came in great fury to set fire
<PB REF="119"/> on the gates, and to scale the Town although for y<SUP>e</SUP> time they lost their labors, &amp; many of thē their liues, where in the end they were cōstrained to retire to their no litle shame &amp; great confusion. And in their retraict, <HI>Norandel</HI> with four or fiue hundred men, issued at a postern gate, &amp; set vpon them behind, which put thē in such fear, y<SUP>t</SUP> they draue them to their tents. Yet not being content with this first repulse they determined on friday after either to die, or enter into the town. And the day appointed, ran vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> wals, where the number of y<SUP>e</SUP> assailants was so great, &amp; the assault giuen in so ma∣ny places both by sea &amp; land, y<SUP>t</SUP> if God had not prouided for them, it is most certain y<SUP>e</SUP> town had ben takē: especially on <HI>Frandalos</HI> side, for the most part of his men fled away from their guard: wherby it happened, y<SUP>t</SUP> more then a hundred Turks mounted on the wals, but they staied not long, for y<SUP>t</SUP> the emperor (who during the assault staied in the midst of the city with the rest of all his power to aid such places as had most néed) aduertised therof, marched to <HI>Fran∣dalos</HI> quarter, and with such force repulsed the enemy, that hée made thē glad to get them thence, in such sort, y<SUP>t</SUP> they receaued no lesse losse at the second assault then at the first. It is true, y<SUP>e</SUP> ten of y<SUP>e</SUP> knights of great Brittain were slaine at y<SUP>e</SUP> conflict, which much gréeued their companions, specially for y<SUP>e</SUP> losse of <HI>Ledarin,</HI> of <HI>Feiar∣que,</HI> of <HI>Trys,</HI> and <HI>Imosil</HI> of Burgundy. This second assault hauing had such issue as you heard before, <HI>Armato</HI> went to counsell with all y<SUP>e</SUP> other kings and princes to know what they shold do, where it was concluded to kéep their tents, and so inclose y<SUP>e</SUP> town: for to get it by assault, they knew ful wel they shuld but lose their labors wherfore they ment no more to try y<SUP>e</SUP> same: but many times made skirmishes with y<SUP>e</SUP> citty to their no litle losse. Thus they passed a∣boue a month without doing any thing worthy y<SUP>e</SUP> rehearsing, till one day among y<SUP>e</SUP> rest, a gentlewomā belonging to the souldan of Liquie came on message to the gate y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Norandel</HI> had in charge, of whō she asked if y<SUP>e</SUP> knight of the great serpent were among them. Wherfore? said <HI>Norandel.</HI> I bring him (said she) a letter from the chéef and most courteous knight in all Asia. <HI>Norandel</HI> desirous to vnderstād the contents of the letter, said hée was the man. Then looke vpon it (saied shee) at your leisure: And if you thinke it
<PB REF="120"/> good returne an answere: with that shée turned her horse, and rid the same way that shee came. Which done, <HI>Norandel</HI> opened the letter, the contents whereof are these.</P>
<P><HI>Rodrigue</HI> great Soudan of Liquie, friend to the gods, and ene∣my to their enemies, defendor of the Pagan law: to thée that cal∣lest thy self knight of y<SUP>e</SUP> great serpent, gréeting. Know thou that y<SUP>e</SUP> cause of our long voyage by Sea to enter into these countries, hath béene in hope to bee reuenged of the outrages that my vn∣cle <HI>Armato</HI> king of Turky hath receiued at the hands of thée and thy cōpanions, not hauing once offēded thée: and although we are most sure of y<SUP>e</SUP> destruction of the wicked emperor y<SUP>e</SUP> fauoureth thée in thy so wicked and damnable enterprises, and that before long time be past, both hee and his shall end their liues by our hands, yet should I be much gréeued, that this misfortune should happen vnto thée, before I haue prooued my body against thine, because of the renowne y<SUP>t</SUP> is spread of thée throughout the world. Wher∣fore chuse whether thou wilt accept of the combate betwéene vs two alone, of tenne to tenne, a hundred to a hundred, or of grea∣ter number as thou thinkest good. Swearing vnto thée, by all our gods, that those thou shalt bring with thée for that cause, shall re∣ceiue no more displeasure then my self, vnlesse it be by such as are ordained to fight with them, according to the agréement we shall make. Wherefore make mée an answere worthy such a Knight, that thereby thy honour be not stained.</P>
<P><HI>Norandel</HI> hauing read this letter, shewed it to his friends, who were all of aduise to graunt the Soudan his request. But <HI>Noran∣del</HI> would determine nothing before hée made the Emperour ac∣quainted, vnder whose conduct during the siege, he had submitted himselfe: whereupon hee went to speake with him, and hauing shewed him the contents of the letter that hée had receiued in <HI>Es∣plandians</HI> name, and the counsell of his companions, the Empe∣rour asked him what hee thought therein. My lord (saied hee) if it pleased you, that I and nine others which I will chuse, shall vn∣dertake this combate, you shal doe vs great fauor. My good friend (said the Emperor) you sée the estate wherein I am, and the time wherein I ought to kéepe, not onely you and others wherein I
<PB REF="120"/> put my whole affiance, but the meanest souldiour in this Cittye. Neuertheles, I will so much agrée vnto your will, that if you and your companions thinke it good, I am content you do it. My lord (said <HI>Norandel</HI>) both I and they most humblye craue it of your grace. Wel then (said the Emperour) If it pleaseth God, you shal win honour thereby, as you haue done before in many as perril∣lous aduentures as this is. <HI>Norandel</HI> thanked the Emperour, and the same day caused his Knights of great Brittaigne to bee as∣sembled together, by whose aduise there was an Aunswere fra∣med to the Soudans letters, the contents whereof doe follow.</P>
<P>The knights that are seruants to Iesus Christ, being at this time with the Emperor of Constantinople, for the defence &amp; aug∣mentation of the Christians name, to thée <HI>Rodrigue</HI> Souldan of Liquie, like gréeting thou hast sent vnto the knight of the great serpent: a gentlewoman that saith shee belongeth vnto thée, that hath giuen vs a letter directed vnto him, the contents wherof are in two points. In y<SUP>e</SUP> first, y<SUP>u</SUP> complainest of the enterprises he hath made against thine vncle king <HI>Armato:</HI> in the other thou shewest a desire y<SUP>u</SUP> hast to proue thy person against his, or a greater num∣ber against a greater, as he shal think it good. But for y<SUP>t</SUP> the knight thou writest vnto at this present is not here, nor in place wheras he can return thée answer, we thought it conuenient in his behalf to satisfie thy request, &amp; to accept the offers thou hast made vnto him: assuring thée, y<SUP>t</SUP> here is the son of a king, &amp; nine other knights with him y<SUP>t</SUP> wil fight with thée and as many more of thine, if thou be content therwith: Aduise thy self thē herein, &amp; hauing receiued thy answere, with safe conduict safely to go and come, we wil not faile to be in the place where you shall appoint.</P>
<P>This letter sealed vp, <HI>Norandel</HI> gaue it to one of his squires to bear it to the soudan, who made him answere y<SUP>t</SUP> he desired only to proue his body against the knight of y<SUP>e</SUP> great serpent &amp; none other. But (saied he) if those y<SUP>t</SUP> sent you hether haue any desire to fight a∣gainst ten of my knights, they shall find thē ready, being as great gentlemen and of as high a linage as they are. And as touching their safe conduict, I wil so wel prouide for it, y<SUP>t</SUP> they shall haue oc∣casion to think wel of me: wherfore return thou vnto thē, and let
<PB REF="121"/> me know their answere. With that the squire hauing his dis∣patch, went and came so often betwéene them, that in the end the combate of ten to ten was fully agréed vpon, and the lists appoint hard before the Towne: where they the next morning the tenne knights went, whose names were as followeth. <HI>Norandel, Gar∣uate du Val Craintif, Talanque, Manely, Ambor de Galdel, Elian le delibere, Brauor</HI> son of <HI>Balan, Trion</HI> cousin germane to Quéene <HI>Briolanie, Imosil de Burgoigne,</HI> and <HI>Listoran</HI> of the siluer bridge.</P>

And this circle (saied she) being round as you behold it, shall without ceasing bee witnesse of our loues, seruing for a rampart to this army: which (if it pleaseth God) in defending it shal so wel defend his master, y<SUP>t</SUP> he shall return in as good health as I desire he should. <HI>Norandel</HI> thanked her most heartily: mean time <HI>Leonorine</HI> intertained <HI>Talanque, Manely</HI> &amp; the rest, to whom she said: My friends, I hope the Lord wil shew you so much grace that the victory shall be yours, for the combat you take in hand is not for to defend the honour of a Gentle woman, but the glorious faith of Christ. If therfore it be so, y<SUP>e</SUP> strength procéedeth from him, be you thē wel assured, y<SUP>t</SUP> he wil impart so much to you as you shal want. Madame (said <HI>Talanque</HI>) at other times we haue ben at the like feast, from whence we haue returned to the great expence of those y<SUP>t</SUP> called vs thither: as (if it be Gods wil) we hope this day to do y<SUP>e</SUP> like. Wherwith taking their leaues of her, they went to find their horses, and being mounted, the emperor with great number of knights and gentlewomen brought them to the gate: And com∣mitting them to God, the ten knights marched brauely to y<SUP>e</SUP> place of combat, where the souldan with a great number of his friends met thē, asking them whom the emperor had appointed iudge on their side. Souldan (said <HI>Norandel</HI>) wée desire no other iudge then your self, that are accounted a curteous and most faithfull prince. By all my gods (said he) I had rather die a thousand deaths, then you should indure the least iniury in the world: we beléeue it wel (said al the knights. With y<SUP>t</SUP> he caused them to enter into the lists at one end, and the ten pagans at the other: but before they entred into fight, he called <HI>Norandel</HI> &amp; his companions, &amp; said vnto them: My friends, I pray you let me shew you what the custome of my country is in such affairs: thē if you think good, you may obserue it, if not, my knights shal kéep your custome if it be indifferēt. Shew vs thē (said <HI>Norandel</HI>) what it is, &amp; if y<SUP>e</SUP> same be reasonable, we wil not refuse it. You shal vnderstand (said he) y<SUP>t</SUP> all knights iustle one against one, to y<SUP>e</SUP> end, y<SUP>t</SUP> all men may know y<SUP>e</SUP> excellency of the vi∣ctor: And if any one be ouerthrown, he y<SUP>t</SUP> is on horseback shall not assaile y<SUP>e</SUP> other before their companions haue run out their course:
<PB REF="122"/> Then he that is on horseback shall alight, and shall fight it out by dint of sword with him that before was ouerthrown. Because it chanceth oftentimes, that the best knights that are fall into such inconuenience, only by the fault and means of bad horses, which cause them diuers times either to faile in striking of their enemy, or els not to run their right course: Which cannot bee excused in those that are on foot, to whome it is permitted to succour each o∣ther if néed require. Truly (said <HI>Norandel</HI>) that custome is wel or∣dained, and I and my companions will obserue the same. Wher∣with the soudan went out of the lists, causing his Heralds to pro∣claim the fight: With that a Pagan stepped forth against <HI>Noran∣del,</HI> that refused him not: but couering himselfe with his shield, they met so fiercely, that their spears were brokē to their wrests, méeting body to body with so great strength, that the Pagan fell ouer his horse taile, lying flat vpon the ground: but <HI>Norandel</HI> had no hurt, onely that his horses shoulder was thrust out of ioint, so that he lighted of, staying til the rest had runne their course, as he had promised. Then <HI>Garuate du Val Craintif</HI> ran against one of the other, and they charged each other in such sort, that their féet failing in their stirrops, they were both cast out of their saddles. Then <HI>Talanque</HI> ran against the third Pagan, to whome fortune was more fauourable then to any of the rest: for they ran so wel, that neither of them once started aside, or moued in their saddles, and yet brake their speares in many péeces. The like chanced to <HI>Manely</HI> and <HI>Ambor,</HI> but not to <HI>Brauor</HI> the son of <HI>Balan,</HI> for hee hit him that ran against him right in the breast, and threw him from his horse. And presently therewith <HI>Imosil</HI> of Burgundy had so great a stroke with a launce, that his eies started in his head, and was therewith so much astonished, that his horse bare him to the side of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rriers, where he fell downe flat. <HI>Elian le delibere,</HI> and hee that ran against him, were constrained to holde by their hor∣ses maines. <HI>Listoran</HI> of the siluer bridge missed his stroke, and his enemy likewise: the like happened to <HI>Trion,</HI> and the last that ran with him. That done, all they that were on horsebacke, lighted downe to fight with swords, and there began betwéen them such a fight as the like had not béene séene of so few knights together,
<PB REF="122"/> maintaining themselues so brauely one against the other, that the strongest of them was so wearie and out of breath, that they were constrained to rest. And as <HI>Norandel</HI> leaned vpō his sword which he rested on the ground, the bracelet that <HI>Minoresse</HI> gaue him fell downward vpon his arme, which put him in so good re∣membraunce of her, that cleane forgetting all the trauaile hée he had taken before, he spake so loud that euery man might hear, and said: By God, sir Knight, this rest doth not beséeme vs: ma∣ny men will from henceforth be in doubt of the great glory that now we meane to win. Wherefore let euery man shewe forth what he can doe, and let no man spare. Wherewith taking the little péece of his shield that rested in his hand, and lifting vp his arme, he gaue so great a blow vnto his enemie, that he made him réele therewith: and doubling it, strake him so surely on the hel∣met, that with the blow the Turke was forced to knéele downe, and let his sword fall out of his hand: which <HI>Norandel</HI> seased vp∣on being readie to strike off his head, if he had not cried him mer∣cie: which <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Manely</HI> perceiuing, employed their for∣ces in such manner, that it might easily be iudged they would soon obtaine the victorie. As for <HI>Brauor</HI> he had alreadie stricken his knight downe, wherefore he ranne to helpe the rest, and <HI>Noran∣del</HI> likewise. With the which helpe it soone appeared, that they which rested yet to ouercome would not long resist: for in short space they found themselues in such extremitie, that vnlesse the Souldan of Liquie had desired the Christian knights to stay a while, they had all died: but calling <HI>Norandel</HI> vnto him, he said: I pray you (said he) procéed no further in this combat, and con∣tent your selues that I account my knights for vanquished, as in truth they are, and so hardly handled, that the force you shall from henceforth vse against them, shall more be holden for a kinde of crueltie than any chiualrie. Neuertheles if my request may take no place with you doe as you thinke good. Souldan (said <HI>Noran∣del</HI>) if they acknowledge it at our hands and aske vs mercie, they shall not faile to haue it: for it was neuer our custome to vse force to such as could not stand against vs. Content your selues (saide he) that I that am their Lord yéeld you the victorie, and I pray
<PB REF="123"/> you therefore shew mercie vnto them, swearing vnto you by my crowne (if you doe them so much good) that while I liue, I will not be vnmindfull of the same. With that the ten Christian knightes went out of the fielde, and mounting on their horses, tooke their way vnto the citie, where the Emperour staied for them, for he had séene the issue of the combat, and how they re∣turned victors: but he heard not what words had past betwéene them, till they being lighted off their horses, told him what was done, for the which hee praised God, estéeming more of them for their courtesie they had shewen vnto the enemy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. L. How Queene Calafre came to aide the Pagans, and of the maruai∣lous and perillous assault that shee gaue to the citie of Constan∣tinople.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He renowne of this warre vndertaken by the Kings, Taborlans, Souldans, Ca∣liffes, and Princes dwelling in Tartaria, India, Arabia, and other countries in the East, against the Emperour and his Em∣pire of Constantinople, was spread so far abroad, that it was knowne to the puis∣sant Quéene <HI>Calafre</HI> reigning in Califo∣rine, a most fertile and pleasant countrey, confining on the head of the riuer Boristenes, hard by the foot of the Riffee mountains. This countrey whereof I speake, was sometimes peopled with good knights and men of all quarters, but the women vpon ma∣lice deuised a meanes to kill them all, establishing a law among themselues, that from that time forwardes they would acknow∣ledge for Ladie and Quéene one of their owne country women, gouerning themselues as the Amazons vsed to doe. Whereby it was not lawfull for any of them to vse the companie of men aboue once or twice a yéere, vpon the daies and times by them appointed, when they went out of their owne countrie and vsed
<PB REF="123"/> their neighbours helpe, with whom God knoweth if they found not meanes to make them pay the vsurie of the time lost, in such sort, that most of them returned home with child: but the brin∣ging vp of their children was far different, for the maiden chil∣dren were kept aliue, burning their right paps, but not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> children, for as soone as they were borne they put them to death, hauing agréed not to suffer one aliue, or els so few, that they very easily might ouercome them. For this cause often times they warred against the Tartarians bordering on their country, put∣ting them to great trouble by diuers and continuall inuasions, as well by sea as by land. In their lawes and customes they ob∣serued so great rigour, as that if any man (by casualtie or other∣wise) fell into their hands, he prooued for food vnto a great num∣ber of griffo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, nourished among them when they were young, being so tame and gentle, that neuer any hauke knewe better the Faulkoners lure, then those gentle birds knew the voice of her that ordinarily fedde them. To come vnto the point, this quéene of Califorine being a woman of great spirit, valiant, har∣die, young, faire, and of good behauiour, hearing of the warres vndertaken against the Christians, was desirous to be there, not for any ill shée wished them, but onely for to know them, and to sée their countrey that bare so great renowme. And for that cause she assembled great numbers of the principall ladies of her countrey, shewing them what honour they might obtaine in that voiage: which may peraduenture be such (said shée) that by our force and great prowesse wée may greatly augment our Empire, béeing feared and redoubted of each man, and not con∣tinue alwaies buried among these mountaines, as they in times past did, of whome at this present wée now possesse and enioye the place. The Quéene in this sort could so well persuade them, that they being mooued with a marueilous desire to goe with her, presently prepared their shippes, and set saile for Thracia, with so good and prosperous a winde, that the tenth day after the assaults of Constantinople, they arriued in the ar∣mie of <HI>Armato,</HI> where they were honourably receiued: &amp; after
<PB REF="124"/> diuers spéeches vsed by the Souldan of Liquie, and other princes of the campe vnto the quéene of Califorine, specially touching their determination concerning that great enterprise, shée being sorrie they had done so little against the towne, desired them that she might once haue leaue to try her fortune against it, by means that she would vse. And the better to induce them thereunto, she told them she had fiftie griffons that would not faile (béeing let out of their cages) to sease vpon the Christians without hurting of her women, because they knewe them and had béen nourished with them. And while they take their flight (said she) I will giue such an assault against the towne, that without doubt wee will enforce the same: for if the Emperors souldiers appeare but to defend the wals, my Griffons shall be ready to carrie them clean away, as the Merlin doth the larke. But to the end (said she) your men receiue no hurt, let them abide within their tentes till they be shut into their cages. When king <HI>Armato</HI> and the Souldan of Liquie heard the great zeale and affection she shewed to em∣ploy her forces, as also the inuention that she had, they all agréed that the next day after she should doe what liked her. Whereupō she sent presently to her that kept the griffons, that shée should giue them nothing for to eate of all that day, that when they meant to vse them at the assault, they might be gréedier: and fur∣ther sent worde by sound of drumme, that all her companies should be readie the next day early in the morning, to giue as∣sault vnto the citie. Quéene <HI>Calafre</HI> hauing in this maner proui∣ded for her enterprise, at the time appointed all her women ar∣med according to their manner (the most part of them bearing bowes) ranne with great furie vnto the walles, and with their ladders began to mount vp: with that the alarme went about the citie, all men running to defend the same: and as they were some vpon the walles and other places of defence, the Quéene made signe to let the Griffons loose, which being hungry and fly∣ing ouer the towne, seazed vpon such as they could find abroad: wherewith the Emperours souldiers were in so great feare, that most part of them that fought, forsooke the walles to hide them∣selues. Alas what pitie was it to sée souldiers, citizens, knights,
<PB REF="124"/> and others, yea women and little children, and all whatsoeuer they could get into their clawes taken vp into the aire, and som∣times hauing taken them vp, they let them fall vpon the stones, whereby they had a strange and cruell death: surely if God had not kept the Cittie better than those that had the charge, it is most sure it had béene taken at that time. But there happened a strange case, for as the Griffons helde their prey, and that the Knights of great Brittaine with some small number of others, resisted the assault made by the women, the Turkes (that had béen aduertised not to come out of their tents while they assailed the towne) mooued with too gréedy a desire to sacke the Citte which they thought surely had béen taken, ranne vnto the assault making such a noise, that the Griffons (féeding on their preyes) left the bodies they had seazed vpon, and flying vp againe, seased on them that they sawe come running to the towne, whereof in short space after they made so great a butcherie, that more than foure hundred Turkes were presently slaine by them: meane time those within the towne perceiuing that good fortune, did so fiercely repulse the Californiens, that their principall women lay dead within the ditches: wherewith the Quéene was forced to retire, knowing her enterprise would not take effect as shée desired it should, not by reason of her souldiers, but in that they kept not in as they had promised. Wherewith she commanded to take the birdes againe, but the Falconers could not by any meanes make them to come in, before they had slaine and deuou∣red aboue a thousand Turkes and others, whereof they onely suckt the blood. Wherewith king <HI>Armato</HI> and the Souldan of Liquie were so grieued, that from thenceforth they began to shew so hard a countenance to the Quéene, that shée was in the minde to returne into her countrey, not offering from that time once to giue stroke with sword to their aduantage. Yet not long after shée was appeased, and fought with King <HI>Ama∣dis,</HI> as it shall bée shewed you at large in the end of this our fift Booke. And that wée may haue the better meanes to attaine thereto, wée will now returne againe vnto the Christian Princes, that assembled their powers and forces to helpe the
<PB REF="125"/> Emperour, imbarking themselues as presently you shall heare. But before they arriued at Constantinople, many good knights both of great Brittaine and others were slaine within the citie, not onely in the assaultes made against it by the Pagans, but at the last assault made by the quéene <HI>Calafre,</HI> among the which, none were so much lamented as <HI>Ledarin de Faiarque, Trys, Imo∣sill</HI> of Burgundie, and the two sonnes of the gyant <HI>Balan.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F you haue read the discourse of this our history, it hath béene shewed you before, how <HI>Enil</HI> went vnto the Emperour of Rome, and <HI>Florestan</HI> king of Sardaigne, and what became of <HI>Gandalin</HI> after he had passed the straights of Giberaltar, and en∣tred in the Ocean sea, euen to great Brit∣taine and other places, where hée found king <HI>Amadis</HI> and others, to whome he had charge to goe: Now we must declare the rest. You shall therefore vnderstand, that <HI>Gandalin</HI> hauing soiourned eight daies in London, more by the commaundement of king <HI>Amadis</HI> and Quéene <HI>Oriane,</HI> than for the pleasure that hee tooke in the woman they had caused him to marrie, knowing the affaires wherein he had left his compani∣ons, departed from thence, and trauailed so long, that he arriued in Fraunce, and went vnto king <HI>Perion</HI> to whome he gaue the letters that his sonne and grand-child sent vnto him: and withall declared the state of the East countries, as they then were, with the inconuenience that might fall vnto all Christendome, if the Empire of Constantinople were in obedience to the infidels. So well could <HI>Gandalin</HI> tell his tale, that the good old king <HI>Perion</HI> mooued with a holy zeale, determined to go himselfe in person,
<PB REF="125"/> and to take with him great quantity of ships and men, furnished for the wars. <HI>Gandalin</HI> stayed not long with him, but while hee prepared himselfe, hee went into Scotland, Norway, Sobradise, Denmarke and Sweathland, and did his Embassages so well, that all the Kings and Princes to whome hee went, determined with all spéede to aid <HI>Esplandian,</HI> in such sort, that in short time af∣ter their ships were ready, and those of Sweathland, Norway, and Denmarke, come vnto the port of Suer, from whence set∣ting saile, they coasted along Freseland, Holland, and Braband, till they arriued at Bulloigne, where king <HI>Perion</HI> had prepared great number of Ships, Hulkes, and other vessels: which being furnished with men, victuals, and munition necessarye for the warres, hoised saile and put to sea. And coasting Normandie, came to little Brittaigne, where they ankered in S. <HI>Mathewes</HI> Hauen, where the Kings, <HI>Luisart</HI> and <HI>Amadis</HI> accompanied of <HI>Grumedan</HI> and diuers other knights, were arriued to refresh thē∣selues: hauing passed the Isle of Sorlingue, the Irish men imbar∣ked themselues at the cape Antiquan, and the Scots at cape Bas∣so. And hauing sailed the way that the Brittons had past, ioined with the Westerne Princes that went that voiage, in such sort, that within thrée daies after they set saile, &amp; hauing a Northeast wind, they discouered the coast of Spaine, passing the Port of <HI>Fi∣nis terre in compostelle:</HI> after that the cape S. <HI>Vincent:</HI> &amp; draw∣ing on the left side, they passed the straights of Gibraltar, &amp; lea∣uing Barbary and Guinde on the right hand, sailed toward Ta∣mar, Austora, and Lagarde, minding to leaue Maiorque &amp; Minor∣que, to enter into y<SUP>e</SUP> straights of Busina and Monaco, &amp; frō thence to saile to the ports of Elese and Corse, where they met with <HI>Flo∣restan</HI> king of Sardaigne &amp; his fléet, but before they ariued there, fortune was so contrary vnto them, that certaine of their Galli∣ons could not follow the ships, but staied behind to the number of eight, being so scattered, y<SUP>t</SUP> they made account they had been lost. Neuerthelesse, the next day they arriued all at Port S. <HI>Luce,</HI> where without longer staying they passed forward to go to Regi, where the army of the Emperor of Rome (comming from Osty) lay at anker staying for them. Where they continued six daies,
<PB REF="126"/> not onely to take in fresh water, but also to calke and mend their shippes and other vessels that had néed: the seuenth day hauing a good wind, they hoysed ankers, and setting saile, coasted along the country of Morea, comming to cape de Maluasie, where the winde fell somewhat contrarie: but in the end the sea waxing calme, put forward to Cape Calon, and the Isle of Negrepont: and entring into the Archipelago they discouered the side of the cape Athos, till they approched Galiopi, leauing the Ile of Te∣nedos, because they would not be discouered by the Turkes that <HI>Armato</HI> had set there to kéepe a passage for his victuals to bée brought vnto the armie: where they staied not long but they entred into the goulfe of Propontide, coasting Thrace, till they came vnto the Port of Salombre, which is not aboue thirtie miles from the citie of Constantinople, where they landed, that they might the better approch the Pagans campe: with that they agréed among them that king <HI>Childadan</HI> and <HI>Quedragant</HI> should be Generals of the armie by sea: and hauing left suffici∣ent number of men for the furnishing and safe kéeping of their shippes, their fléet sailed towards Constantinople, hoping to set vpon <HI>Alphorax</HI> and his armie by sea before they should perceiue them. But it fell out otherwise, for the Turkes that had spies in all places, discouered them, not suffering <HI>Alphorax</HI> to fight, de∣siring him most earnestly onely to kéepe the entrie of the straits to take all meanes from the towne to be victualled on that side. Which king <HI>Childadan</HI> and <HI>Quedragant</HI> vnderstanding, would not hazzard themselues, but ankered within halfe a myle of the enemie, staying for king <HI>Luisart,</HI> the Emperour of Rome, and those that marched by land, meane time giuing diuers skirmi∣shes to the enemie with their Pinnaces, but <HI>Alphorax</HI> for all that would not leaue his hole, lying as close as possibly he could: on the other side <HI>Armato</HI> and his company being aduertised of the great aid that came towards the towne, caused their forces to as∣semble, determining to kéep the side of the great sea, by y<SUP>e</SUP> which they might easilier recouer victuals, as well from Natolia as out of Tartaria. The kings <HI>Amadis, Perion,</HI> &amp; others made such hast, that the ninth day after they incamped themselues in y<SUP>e</SUP> sight
<PB REF="126"/> of Constantinople right before their enemies, in a place that sée∣med most conuenient. But if the Pagans at the first were much abashed to sée those succours, the Emperor &amp; those within y<SUP>e</SUP> town were not much lesse, doubting it had béen some new forces come against the towne: for they had not any intelligence of the sen∣ding of <HI>Gandalin</HI> &amp; <HI>Enil</HI> to the christian princes, that brought with them a multitude both of ships &amp; men, as well knights as others. Now to returne to the Christians fléet: King <HI>Childadan</HI> know∣ing that <HI>Alphorax</HI> plaied the foxe, desired <HI>Quedragant</HI> (hauing equall power with him) to be content that he with thréescore pin∣naces might skirmish with him, that thereby if it were possible, he might prouoke him to come out, which he agréed vnto: where∣fore setting saile, he made towards the enemie, so néere, that they were ready to fight hand to hand: neuertheles <HI>Alphorax</HI> for that time would not touch the bait, but entred farther in the straights: wherewith king <HI>Childadan</HI> retired, and came vnto the hauen of the citie, making the brauest show that might be séene: those of Constantinople perceiuing the bandirols and streamers of great Brtttain &amp; of other christian princes, made him answer with the like, and so high, that the noise of the trumpets, clerons, &amp; tabers was so great, that <HI>Armato</HI> and all the Pagans might easily hear it. With that king <HI>Childadan</HI> was receiued by the Emperor, <HI>No∣randel,</HI> &amp; others, to whome he shewed what aide was come vnto them, and what princes had taken the voiage in hand. In good faith (said the Emperor) they bind me for euer vnto them, yet am I much abashed how they vnderstood of the wars betwéene <HI>Ar∣mato</HI> &amp; me. What? my Lord (said <HI>Childadan</HI>) did <HI>Esplandian</HI> neuer tell you therof? No I assure you (said the Emperor) nor any of his companions, as far as I know. Is he not in the city (said y<SUP>e</SUP> king?) In good truth (said <HI>Norandel</HI>) hee would not leaue the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> minding to kéep it, if the Pagans came to be∣siege it. Assure your selues (said <HI>Childadan</HI>) he will not long stay there before king <HI>Amadis</HI> sendeth for him: for we determine pre∣sently to giue battell, &amp; if he should faile at such a iourny, it would gréeue him euer after.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">K</SEG>Ing <HI>Childadan</HI> returned to Quedragant as you heard before, and the army on land incamped in sight of the enemy, <HI>Amadis</HI> was aduertised by those that had ben in the city of Constantinople, that <HI>Esplandian</HI> and the king of Denmarke were at the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> wherevpon he sent <HI>Gandalin</HI> to fetch them, <HI>Gandalin</HI> tooke shipping, and had so good a winde, that without any aduenture hee arriued there, where hee declared vnto them howe king <HI>Amadis</HI> and almost all the Christian Princes were incamped within halfe a mile of the Pagans host, and all what hee and <HI>Enil</HI> had done considring their charge. And because (said <HI>Gandalin</HI>) that our men are determined shortly to giue them bataile, they pray you to come vnto them. Truly (saied <HI>Esplandian) Gandalin</HI> my friend, you haue wrought the matter well, and I thanke you for the paines that you haue taken. My lord (saied the king of Denmarke) are you not deter∣mined that we go vnto them? For my part, I had rather lose one of mine armes, then faile thereof. Brother (saied <HI>Esplandian</HI>) to morrow if it pleaseth God, the great serpent shall bring vs thi∣ther: before that time it had alwaies vsed to saile of it selfe, but as then it failed. For when they were entered into it, it stirred not, whereat <HI>Gandalin</HI> much abashed, could not refraine to say: By god, this vessell is like to the horse with the white legge, that faileth vs when we haue most néed.

And <HI>Esplandian</HI> saied true, for at the same time the countrey wherein <HI>Vrganda</HI> dwelt, called The vnknowne Island, (because it was alwaies inuisible) was as then discouered and séene of all men. With that <HI>Gandalin</HI> counselled them to enter into the Pinnace, which <HI>Esplandian</HI> and the king of Denmarke did, and hauing a good winde, sayled tow∣ards Constantinople, and on a sunday in the morning they espied the vessels of king <HI>Childadan</HI> and <HI>Quedragant,</HI> which not long af∣ter they borded, where <HI>Esplandian</HI> and y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Denmark were receiued with great ioy: after that hee went to sée his father and the rest of the knights that were on lande, and after an infinite number of imbracings and welcomes on all sides, they determi∣ned to visit their enemies somewhat néerer, wherby many braue skirmishes were made, where the women of Quéen <HI>Calafre</HI> were continually in armes, and among the rest, a sister of the Quéenes named <HI>Liote,</HI> a hardy and valiant ladie, that tooke a Frenchman prisoner, which certefied the Souldan of Liquie that <HI>Amadis de Gaule</HI> king of great Brittaine, and <HI>Esplandian</HI> his sonne were in the army.

<P><HI>Rodrigue</HI> Souldan of Liquie, mortall enemy to the enemies of our gods, and <HI>Calafre</HI> Quéene of Califorine, a countrey most rich and abundant in gold and precious stones, giue you <HI>Amadis de Gaule</HI> king of great Brittaine, and your sonne Knight of the great Serpent to vnderstand, that the occasion of our arriual in these countries, hath been for these two causes. The one in hope to destroy all Christendome, and the other to prooue if wee may take from you the renowne that is spread abroad of you, to bee the two best knights liuing in y<SUP>e</SUP> world: for we account our selues for such, as that if you will accept the combate of your persons against ours, we will euidently make it knowne, that our valor is no lesse then yours. And to the end the glorye of the victors
<PB REF="128"/> may be knowne, the vanquished shall remaine in their powers, to dispose of them as they shall thinke conuenient. Aduise your selues therefore to answere vs herein by this our messenger, to whome wee haue giuen charge to declare vnto you (if you refuse this combate) that from henceforth we shall haue iust occasion to attribute to our selues the aduantage of the praises and endlesse glories that fortune heretofore hath giuen you, and to estéeme of you as meanely in time to come, as you haue béen highly renow∣ned heretofore.</P>
<P>This letter giuen to the Gentlewoman that bare the first to <HI>Norandel,</HI> she went vnto the Christians campe, and being aduer∣tised which was <HI>Amadis</HI> tent, entered therein, as he sate talking with king <HI>Luisart, Esplandian,</HI> and other good knights. Where knéeling on the ground, she asked which of them was the knight of the great Serpent and his father. <HI>Amadis</HI> spake vnto her and saied: Gentlewoman, I am the one, and this is my sonne. Is it your pleasure to speake with vs? The gentlewoman casting hir eie vpon <HI>Esplandian,</HI> maruelling at his great beautie, spake &amp; said: In good faith king <HI>Amadis,</HI> I verily beléeue that this is hee, for I haue heard him in diuers places estéemed for the same that nowe I doe behold in him. Gentlewoman (said <HI>Amadis</HI>) if you came in∣to our camp only to sée him, you now haue your desire. That hath not ben only the cause (said she) but to bring this letter which the Souldan of Liquie and Quéen <HI>Calafre</HI> send vnto you both: wher∣fore hauing read it, I pray you returne an answere. With that (<HI>Amadis</HI> hauing taken it in his hand) the Gentlewoman depar∣ted out of the tent, attending their resolution. King <HI>Amadis</HI> ha∣uing read it, shewed it to King <HI>Luisart</HI> and the rest that were in presence, wherewith there rose great controuersie among them concerning the refusall or acceptation of the combat, for that the most part of them were of aduise it should not be accepted, shew∣ing diuers great and euident reasons to confirm the same, as the greater number of enemies they had before them readye to giue them battaile, &amp; if it happen (said they) that fortune should be con∣trary to king <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>Esplandian</HI> (in whome partly consisteth our hope) such hard chance would bréed great fear in diuers men
<PB REF="128" MS="y"/> that are now very willing &amp; ready to do the best they can. Others held the contrary, saying that it would be shame vnto them al, for that that refusal only would much incourage the enemy, but they were of this opinion, that it might wel be required that the num∣ber of the combatants might be greater. In good truth (saie <HI>Ama∣dis</HI>) be it of two against two, twenty against twenty, or of grea∣ter number, the victory is in the hands of God. Wherefore in re∣fusing thereof, I should doe my selfe wrong, and cause a great ble∣mish to all Christendome, that would not be defaced in long time after. Besides I haue great hope of Gods helpe herein, for whose faith and honour I haue vndertaken this voiage. When <HI>Esplan∣dian</HI> heard his fathers mind, he spake boldlier and said: That he would take that combate vpon himselfe alone, not onely against the Souldan and the Quéene, but against two others more with them, rather then it so should be refused: whereupon it was con∣cluded, that <HI>Amadis</HI> and he would fight, and sending for the mes∣senger into the tent, <HI>Amadis</HI> saied vnto her: Gentlewoman, you shall tel the Souldan and the Quéene that I and my son are con∣tent to doe as they require, wherefore let them chuse what arms they will, and for the place it shall bee betwéene their campe and ours: assuring them on the faith of a king, that not one of our sol∣diours shall once remoue, how soeuer we spéed, which wee desire likewise at their hands: and if it bée their desire to haue the com∣bate fought this day, we are content to doe it. With that the gen∣tlewoman returned, and comming to the Souldans tent, shée de∣clared her message vnto thē, being such as you haue heard: wher∣of the Souldan was glad, but especially the Quéene, for the great desire she had to sée <HI>Esplandian,</HI> wherefore shee asked the Gentle∣woman what she thought of him. Madame (saied shee) I haue in my life time séene many men and women that nature had indued with great beautie, but by the gods I confesse it is all but pain∣ting in regard of that I haue found in him: for hee is so faire and beautifull, that the more I thinke thereon, so much the more it maketh me cōceiue such beauty to be rather deuine thē humane. That is much (said the Quéene.) I know not (said the gentlewo∣man) what you meane by that word Much, but I am wel assured,
<PB REF="129"/> if you had séene him as I did, that you would say as much as I doe, and it may be more. Truly (saied the Quéene) before I enter in combat with him, I will first sée him vnarmed, and speak with him, not as an enemie to an enemy, but as friends commonly do one vnto the other. Madame (saied the Souldan) séeing it is your desire, it were good our Gentlewoman went againe vnto them, to desire them to giue you leaue to come and visite them in their campe, not to procure them any cause of enuy, but to do them ho∣nour: and for that cause to desire their safe conduct. This coun∣sell séemed good vnto the Quéene, and without longer staying she sent the Gentlewoman backe againe vnto <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>Esplandi∣an</HI> whom she found yet in the Tent whereas she left them. With that she told them what her message was, and the great desire the Quéene had to sée them before they entred into combat. King <HI>A∣madis</HI> could not refraine laughing to hear the Gentlewoman ex∣presse the affection her mistresse had, asking king <HI>Luisart</HI> what he thought therein. Sonne (saied hee) deny not her request, for I as∣sure you (since our comming hether) I haue heard the Quéene to bée estéemed a wise and beautifull Princesse. You heare our an∣swere (saied <HI>Amadis</HI> to the Gentlewoman) let the Quéene come hether when she thinketh good, for she shall be heartely welcome. With that the Gentlewoman returned to the Quéene, who be∣ing greatly pleased with that answere, determined the next daye to goe vnto them. But she knew not well what manner of appa∣rell she were best to weare: sometimes shee thought it fit to goe as she vsed when she went to bataile, and then presently changed opinion, thinking a womans apparrell would bee more séemely and conuenient, séeing she went not to trie their forces, but only to win the loue and fauour of <HI>Esplandian,</HI> if she might procure the same. And thinking on it all night long, in the morning when she meant to apparrell her self, she was resolued to dresse her as wo∣men vse to do, thinking she had means inough afterward to shew her selfe in habite of a knight, whereby shee might bee séene both in the one and the other sort. Whervpon she caused her most pre∣cious robes to be brought vnto her, and apparrelling her self, for∣got not any thing that might once beautifie or adorn her person,
<PB REF="129"/> or that in her opinion would deck her well, the better to be liked. And to bear her company she tooke twelue of her own gentlewo∣men, so well furnished and set forth with stones and pearles, that the like was neuer séene. That done, she sent vnto her ships for a most strange and monstrous beast, wherevpon sometimes shee vsed to ride in great pomp. It was as big as a great Dromadary, the hair long &amp; somewhat yellow, black spots, his two eares han∣ging downe vnto his knées, hauing but one eye, shining brighter then a burning glasse, and stood right in the midst of his forehead: out of his mouth there issued two great téeth like hornes, and al∣though his féet were clouen like an ox, yet was there no Hart in all the world y<SUP>t</SUP> could outrun him, were it in plaine way, or ouer rockes. In that manner she entered into the Christans campe, of whom she was not a little wondred at before shee came to King <HI>Luisarts</HI> tent, where <HI>Amadis</HI> and in a maner all the principal cap∣taines of the army staied for her, praying <HI>Quedragant</HI> to goe out to welcome her, which he did with great courtesie: for he had no sooner espied her, but hee stepped forward, and doing her great re∣uerence, holpe her to discend, and taking her by the arme, led her into the tent, where the lords were all assembled, of whome shee was most honourably receiued. But when she beheld <HI>Esplandians</HI> beauty, she was so much surprised with the loue of him, y<SUP>t</SUP> shee re∣pented her comming thether, not so much for the small hope shee had to win him, (being diuers in religion) but doubting y<SUP>t</SUP> the fan∣tasy newly entred into hir mind would so much estrange hir force (by ouermuch thinking vpon him) when she went to fight, y<SUP>t</SUP> ther∣by she should be in danger to lose the honour and reputation shee had gotten in arms among the best knights in all y<SUP>e</SUP> world: which to preuent, shee determined to stay the lesse time there, knowing the nature of loue to bee such, y<SUP>t</SUP> it can steale the hearts of all per∣sons, and commonly maketh himselfe possessor of it, before hee that hath it in possession, can perceaue it. And as the Princes entertained her with diuers swéete and pleasant spéeches, shee tourned to <HI>Esplandian</HI> and saied: Sir Knight, for two most ex∣cellent graces that are in you, I haue taken the paines to
<PB REF="130"/> come and visite you: The first is the gift of beauty, which is such in you, as I could neuer haue imagined the same: The other is the force of your body and magnanimity of your courage, where∣by you are accounted altogether inuincible. The one I haue séen with mine eies to be so perfect, that I neuer hope to sée the like a∣gaine, although I liued a thousand yeares and more: the other, y<SUP>e</SUP> combat you shal haue against the most puissant Souldan of Li∣quie will be a witnesse vnto vs: and had it not ben that hée reque∣sted me to fight against king <HI>Amadis</HI> (because his onely desire is to prooue his body against yours) I would haue tried it my selfe. Of one thing can I wel assure you, that if the honour remaine to vs and life to you, I will afterward tel you a thing that much im∣porteth me, and which I greatly desire to let you know before I saile into my countrey. Now for this time I haue satisfied my de∣sire: wherefore my lords (said she vnto all the Princes) I beséech you pardon me in not vsing longer spéeches, for I know full well that my long staying with you, (thinking to finde that I hoped for) might possible cause me to lose my selfe, wherewith I should be ouermuch displeased, for that before sunnesetting I hope to bée in place where I will shew such valour in armes, that hee which neuer could be vanquished by man (as it is reported) shal now re∣ceiue an ouerthrow at a simple womans hand. Madame (saied king <HI>Perion</HI>) fortune can doe much when it pleaseth her, if you do as you say, truly you shall doe more then we can well beléeue, but commonly y<SUP>e</SUP> workman is known by his worke, and because the issue of the combat is the glory of him or you, til then we wil defer our iudgements. And although <HI>Amadis</HI> perceiued himselfe much outraged by the quéen, yet he made no sign thereof, but taking her by y<SUP>e</SUP> arm, led her where her company staied, and as shée mounted to return, with a smiling countenance he spake vnto her and said: Madame, whē we come to dealing of blowes I beséech you shew me not the greatest extremity you can, because I was alwaies a friend to women, and euer will be during my life: wherevnto the quéen answered not a word, but rode vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> Pagans camp to arm hir selfe. Mean time <HI>Brian de Moniaste</HI> arriued in the Christians camp, who hauing ben sent by the king of Spain his father with
<PB REF="130"/> a great power of men into Africa, to besiege the town of Cesonie after called Centie, was aduertised by a pirate, of the Christians enterprise, and how their army and great fléet had passed the cape of <HI>Finis terre,</HI> presently sent vnto his father to desire him to giue him leaue to goe that voiage: whereunto by much importunitie he granted. For which cause <HI>Brian</HI> brake vp his siege of Cente, and entring again into his ships sailed to Cicile, and from thence to Galipoli, and so to Constantinople, where he ioyned with the Christian princes that receiued him most gladly.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LIII. How king Amadis and Esplandian his son, fought against the Soul∣dan of Liquie and Queene Calafre, and of the battail fought the same day both by sea and land, betweene the Christians and the Pagans.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Q</SEG>Véene <HI>Calafre</HI> returned to the Pagans campe as you heard before, presently armed her selfe, &amp; the Souldan like wise, and stayed not long before they came vnto the place where the combat was assigned, where not long after they found <HI>Ama∣dis</HI> and <HI>Esplandian:</HI> and because the two campes were not well assured of each other (notwithstanding the oathes and promises on both sides made) they set themselues in order of battaile not stirring one foot: king <HI>Perion</HI> sending word to <HI>Que∣dragant</HI> and king <HI>Childadan,</HI> that as they had intelligence from the enemy, they should set vpon their armie by sea: the like word was sent vnto the Emperour of Constantinople, that he might likewise be prepared: and as the foure combatants were ready to strike each other, the Souldan called <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>Esplandian,</HI> asking them if they would not sweare and kéepe promise (accor∣ding to the agréement sent vnto them by his gentlewoman) that the vanquishers without impeachment should lead away the vanquished. I truly, said they, therefore beware of vs. With that <HI>Amadis</HI> made towards the Quéene, and the Souldan against <HI>Es∣plandian,</HI>
<PB REF="131"/> to whome he gaue so great a blow with his launce into the shield, that he pierced it through: wherby diuers thought as∣suredly he had béen wounded to death, but it was not so, for the launce passed vnder his saddle without any further hurt: but <HI>Es∣plandian</HI> gaue him his exchange, striking him so fiercely, that hée made him loose both stirrop and saddle and fall vpon the ground, with so great might, that he rolled twice or thrice before he stay∣ed, in such manner, that the helmet flew off his head. Quéene <HI>Calafre</HI> ranne against king <HI>Amadis,</HI> and he against her: and as they were in the middle of their course, <HI>Amadis</HI> turned the but end of his launce against her, &amp; passing forward would not strike her: yet shée held her launce downe and strake his horse in the stéele of his forehead, and withall they met so strongly body to body, that therewith the Quéene fell downe, &amp; <HI>Amadis</HI> was con∣strained to light, his horse was so astonished with the truncheon of the launce that stucke within his forehead. But the Quéene rose presently, and with her sword in hand went towards <HI>Ama∣dis,</HI> the like did the Souldan to <HI>Esplandian</HI> that had suffered him to take breath and lace his helmet, not for any good he wished him, but that at the end of his carere hée espied the princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> standing on the walles of Constantinople, whereat he was so abashed, that euery man saide, the Souldan had hurt him in the bodie. Neuerthelesse within short space after they knew the con∣trarie: for hée lighted on foote, where betwéene them two was fought the most perillous combat that euer was séene, for <HI>Rodri∣gue</HI> was as valiant a knight in armes as any in his time: but <HI>Esplandian</HI> handled him in such manner, that often times he made him cleane forget the subtilties that commonly he vsed in such affaires, and in the end vsed him so hardly, that it might euident∣ly be séene the victorie would be his. Meane time the Quéene v∣sed all her force to ouercome king <HI>Amadis,</HI> who holding in his hand a great truncheon of a launce instead of a sword, gaue her such a blowe on the crest of her helmet, that hée made her eyes start within her head. Wherewith shée being much offended, spake vnto him, and said: What sir Knight? doe you thinke me either to he a dogge or else a countrey clowne, that you séeme to
<PB REF="131"/> beat me with a staffe? By my head before you escape out of my handes, there is no armour you haue but will be néedfull for you to the safegard of your life. <HI>Calafre</HI> (said <HI>Amadis</HI>) all my life time I haue béene a seruant vnto Ladies, and if at this time I should begin with you to wish them ill, the good that others haue receiued at my handes would be lesse estéemed. You account mée then (said the Quéene) one of that number: but you shall pre∣sently féele that I am something more: with that shée tooke her sword in both handes, and in great choller gaue him such a blow, that shée claue his shield in two, and thinking to double her stroke, <HI>Amadis</HI> stepped vnto her and plucked hers from off her necke, with such force, that shée was constrained to knéele vpon the ground. Neuerthelesse shée rose presently againe, and thin∣king to be reuenged, vsed all her force to charge <HI>Amadis,</HI> who turning aside gaue her such a blowe with his truncheon hard by the eare, and therewith made her so astonished, that her sworde fell out of her hand: wherewith he stepped forward, and taking her by the helmet, said vnto her: Now you shall be my prisoner whether you will or not, as well as the Souldan is prisoner to my sonne. With that the Quéene looked aside and perceiued that <HI>Amadis</HI> said true: wherefore shée said: Truly I am your priso∣ner séeing fortune will haue it so: and therewith <HI>Rodrigue</HI> and <HI>Esplandian</HI> came vnto them, and they foure going out of the lists, went vnto the Christians campe: the Pagans that saw them ledde away in whome in a manner consisted most of their hope, when the campes should ioyne in battaile, made countenance to rescue them: which caused the Christians to stand all day in order of battaile: meane time they agréed among themselues to send the Souldan and the Quéene vnto Constantinople, <HI>Gan∣dalin</HI> hauing charge to bring them thither, and present them to the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> from <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>Esplandian,</HI> who than∣ked them most heartily. And before hée returned againe vnto the campe, a souldier of Thrace (that had dwelt in Tartaria aboue twentie yéere togither) came and yéelded himselfe vnto the Christians, and tolde King <HI>Perion</HI> and <HI>Luisart,</HI> that their ene∣mies determined the next day in the morning to surprise them
<PB REF="132"/> before they were aware, whereof they aduertised the Emperor of Constantinople, to the end he might be readie. There were in the citie fortie thousand men, whereof he appointed thirtie thou∣sand to issue forth vpon the enemies rereward, as soone as they perceiued the battaile once begon, and gaue likewise intelligence to King <HI>Childadan</HI> and <HI>Quedragant,</HI> that his spies had brought him newes that <HI>Alphorax</HI> had vnfurnished his shippes of men to strengthen their armie on land, trusting to the straights which they meane to kéepe, hoping thereby to saile into the Maiorque seas, if fortune fauour not their enterprise: and there it would be good (with the other Christian princes aduise) that they should set vpon him, and that <HI>Frandalo</HI> with his fléete should second them. Which newes vnderstood by the two Generals of the armie by sea, they sent vnto king <HI>Amadis</HI> and the rest of the Commaun∣ders in the campe, to knowe their aduise: whereunto answer was returned, that they should followe the opinion of the Empe∣rour of Constantinople, which they should execute vpon the next day in the morning: wherevpon <HI>Frandalo</HI> ceased not all night to make and prepare diuers kindes of artificiall fires, wherewith he made account to burne the most part of <HI>Alphorax</HI> ships, which he did, as hereafter you shall heare. But to returne to king <HI>Ar∣mato</HI> and his forces: About an houre before day, according to their former determinations, they began to march against the Christians, thinking to find them sléeping, and thereby to slay their watch before they should haue meanes to set themselues in order of battaile. Neuerthelesse they found themselues deceiued, for they were alreadie set in order of battaile, standing close, with great desire to receiue their enemie as they did: the Emperour of Rome had the vantguard, and with him king <HI>Luisart:</HI> king <HI>A∣madis,</HI> king <HI>Perion, Galaor,</HI> and <HI>Esplandian</HI> the maine battaile: &amp; <HI>Florestan, Bruneo,</HI> and <HI>Balan,</HI> the rereguard. On the Pagans side there marched first, the Souldan of Alaxa, thréescore knightes, two Califfes, and foure Tamorlanes, that in great furie set vp∣on the Emperour of Rome and his battaile: where at their first arriuall many a braue knight was stroken downe, both on the one side and the other, for <HI>Esplandian</HI> and the Christian princes
<PB REF="132"/> being fayned togither, gaue not one blowe but it was a deadly stroke: yet at the first they were repulsed by the great quantitie of arrowes the enemies shot against them, which flew in so great number, that hailestones neuer fell thicker out of the skies: wher∣by it fell out, that both vantguard, maine battaile, and reregard, indured much paine: with that <HI>Norandel, Talanque, Manely, Trion, Landin, Licoran, Imosill, Palomie, Enil, Ellan,</HI> and to con∣clude, all <HI>Esplandians</HI> companions with thirtie thousand men cho∣sen by the Emperour, issued out of the citie: which small troupe (resolutely determined) did so abash the Pagans, that in a man∣ner they all lost their courages: whereby they presently began to recule as farre backe as they aduanced themselues: where∣with those that before had béen in feare tooke courage againe, and turning their faces on the enemie, recouered the ground that they had lost, in such sort, that with good cause they might well crie, Victorie. On the other side, <HI>Quedragant</HI> and <HI>Childadan</HI> set∣ting saile, made towardes the straights, at the entrie whereof <HI>Frandalo</HI> ouertooke them with fourescore vessels of all sorts: and as they had spoken togither touching their enterprise (conside∣ring the great power of their enemies) it was agréed that <HI>Fran∣dalo</HI> (that had prooued them at other times) should first set vpon them: wherwith he began to saile forwards, and <HI>Alphorax</HI> like∣wise against him, giuing a signe of battaile to his men, who with great courage entred vpon ten of the best gallies that the Christians had and sunke them in the sea: yet <HI>Frandalo</HI> nought abashed, set fire on more than an hundred of their shippes before <HI>Childadan</HI> entred into fight: but not long after, hée and <HI>Quedra∣gant</HI> came vnto them, where good defence preuailed. In which fight they continued for the space of eight houres without any signe vpon which side the victorie would fall vntill <HI>Quedragant</HI> borded <HI>Alphorax</HI> shippe and entred by force, slaying all that were therein. What néed I stand longer to discourse? The Turkes séeing their captaine dead, and their manifest ouerthrow before their faces, being ready to fall into the Christians hands, began to flie, and by force of oares entred into the Maiorque sea: but not all, for there were taken, burnt, and drowned about two or
<PB REF="133"/> thrée hundred Gallies, Galleasses, Fustes, and Brigandines, the rest saued themselues, in such sort as you heard before: to whom night was so much assistant, that the chase endured not so long as els it would haue done. <HI>Alphorax</HI> dead, and his armie ouer∣throwne; the Christians assembled themselues togither, staying to heare newes from their armie on land, which in the meane time had had so much to endure, that wonder it was how they could hold out: and among the rest the good olde king <HI>Perion</HI> and <HI>Luisart</HI> séeing <HI>Esplandian</HI> raging like a lyon followed by the hun∣ters, would not leaue him fearing to loose him, and so long they followed him, striking both on the right side and the left, that they found themselues inclosed by aboue a thousand Turkish horsemen, not hauing any other aid by them than <HI>Grumedan</HI> the Duke of Bristowe, <HI>Guilan, Brandoyuas, Nicoran</HI> of the siluer bridge, <HI>Cendil de gonate,</HI> and a few others.

<PB REF="133"/> and more than an hundred Pagans with him: <HI>Amadis</HI> like wise did so valiantly, with all the Knightes of Fraunce, great Brit∣taine, and Swethland, specially the King of Denmarke, <HI>Ta∣lanque, Manely, Ambor,</HI> and <HI>Norandel,</HI> that woonder it was to sée, yet had their valour little preuailed without the aide that the Emperor of Constantinople brought thither, with a great troup of horsemen that the Emperour of Rome had likewise gathered togither: by which meanes king <HI>Armato</HI> with thirtie other Kings and their retinue were cleane ouerthrowne, and the most part of them put to the sword: the Christian Knightes making such slaughter, that the blood ranne about the field in such abun∣dance, as if it had rained blood a whole day togither: and greater had the abundance béene if night had not come on, which separa∣ted them, the Westerne Princes remaining incamped in the field, till day opened, that they might accomplish their desires. Meane time <HI>Amadis</HI> caused watch and Sentinels to be set in all places, because hee had béen aduertised that King <HI>Armato</HI> that had fledde away, assembled his men by little and little, which to doe hée caused hornes and drummes to sound throughout the field, making fire round about the place where hee had retired, sending two knights to the sea side to know what had happened to his sonne: but newes was brought him that he was slaine, and all his shippes burnt and drowned, except fiftie or thréescore that were at the end of the straights of the Maiorque sea, stay∣ing to heare newes of him, assure your selues that such newes pleased him not too well: neuerthelesse perceiuing it more con∣uenient to supply his owne necessitie than to spend the time in sorrow and teares, hée called such captaines as hée had togither, with whome he determined presently to depart, and before day to imbarke that small number of men that rested, before the Christians should perceiue the same. With that he commanded from place to place that euery man should presently retire, and without noise make towards the sea; where being arriued, they entred into their shippes flying towards Tartaria in all the hast they could: wherof the Emperor of Constantinople being aduer∣tised, sent <HI>Frandalo</HI> &amp; diuers gallies with him to follow them, but
<PB REF="134"/> all in vaine: in the meane time the hurt Knightes and souldiers were brought into the citie, and the dead buried each according to his degrée: wherein the Emperour shewed great affection, especially as touching the buriall of the Kings <HI>Perion</HI> and <HI>Lui∣sart,</HI> for whome, <HI>Esplandian</HI> (comming to the Empire) and those that succéeded after him, caused two Pyramides to be made, not any thing inferiour to those which sometime were erected in the citie of Memphis, as well for the Kings <HI>Miris, Chemnis,</HI> as others: and hard by them they buried the bodies of the valiant knights <HI>Balan, Helian, Polimner, Enil, Grumedan,</HI> the good olde man, and diuers other knights that died in that battaile, figh∣ting in the defence of the faith of Iesus Christ, with whome their blessed soules do now remaine in ioy. And because no men∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion hath béen made of Quéene <HI>Calafre</HI> since her captiuitie, nei∣ther of the aide that shée had brought vnto the Pagan kings, it séemeth reason that I should declare the occasion why her wo∣men fought not with the rest, you must vnderstand, that the Quéene perceiuing her in one day to be taken not only with the loue of the knight <HI>Esplandian,</HI> but by the force of his father King <HI>Amadis,</HI> not long after she had béen in the company of the princes <HI>Leonorine,</HI> to whome <HI>Gandalin</HI> brought her, shée sent vnto her sister <HI>Lyote</HI> to will her with her women to return to sea, kéeping apart from all the Pagans, without once stirring from thence, for any thing whatsoeuer should fall, till shée receiued further newes from her, which was partly the cause of the enemies ouerthrow: for they doubting some treason being separated in that sort, from that time forward were in some feare and in greater suspition than before: and not without cause, for that if <HI>Lyote</HI> had aided king <HI>Armato</HI> both by sea and land, as shée might haue done, if her sister had not forbidden her, it is likely her esqua∣dron of women being twentie thousand strong and somewhat more, had done great mischiefe to the Christians: but God of his goodnes prouided better for them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LIIII. How after the Pagans were driuen out of Thrace, the Emperour of Constantinople renouncing his Empire, inuested Esplandian ther∣with, marrying him to his doughter the princesse Leonorine.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He obsequies and funerals of the Kinges, Princes, Lords and others, that died in the battell, being finished, the wounded cu∣red, and all things set at rest: the Empe∣rour of Constantinople knowing that <HI>A∣madis</HI> and those that were come with him from the Westerne parts would retourne againe into their countries, desired them to assemble, shewing them that his meaning was to let them know what hée determined to doe before they went from thence: The next day in the morning they all met in the emperors great hall, and he standing in the middest, spake vnto them and said: My brethren, lords, and good friends, the bond wherein I stand boun∣den vnto you is so great, y<SUP>t</SUP> although it hath pleased God to make me Emperour of all Grecia, yet am I well assured, it is far be∣yond my poore hability to satisfie you for the same, estéeming the honour and riches that I now haue (next vnder God) be it little or much, to procéed from you: I am now thréescore yeares of age, wholly aged &amp; decrepit, by reason of the paines that in my youth∣full yeares I haue continually taken in following armes: so it is I haue but one child, which is a daughter, the onely staffe &amp; hope of my old yeares, whome I haue determined (if you thinke good) to giue in marriage vnto the valiant knight <HI>Esplandian,</HI> and with her likewise to inuest him with the Empire and gouernement of all my countries. And the better to liue solitarily, and to seperate my selfe from worldly company, I haue determined to goe (with the Empresse my wife) into the monastery that I caused to bee made, there to liue religiously, calling vpon God and doing pen∣nance for the euils I haue committed heretofore. Wherefore my
<PB REF="135"/> good lords and friendes I pray you, if this my determination like you well, let euery man giue consent, and you first (saied hee vnto king <HI>Amadis</HI>) to whom the matter toucheth néerer then to any of the rest, as being father and sonne. My lord (said he) my sonne shal doe as you command him. I will tell you, (said the Emperour) I remember that among other Prophesies which ought to happen in this our time, there is one that maketh me (as I think) agrée with you in one consent. <HI>Esplandian</HI> hath vpon his body (as I haue vnderstood) certaine carracters, which shew his name and others that in no wise can be read, but only by the woman that is ordai∣ned to be his wife, let vs now sée if it be my daughter or not: with that he sent for the Princesse <HI>Leonorine,</HI> who being brought the∣ther by the Empresse and diuers other ladies, the Emperour de∣sired <HI>Esplandian</HI> to open his doublet and shew them the letters hée had borne vpon his body from his mothers wombe, which hée re∣fused not, but before them all shewed them openly, where euerye man might easily perceiue the white carracters, containing this word <HI>Esplandian,</HI> but they could not know the red: wherefore the Emperour caused his daughter to come néere, asking her what she could doe therein. My lord (said she) not long before <HI>Melie</HI> be∣traied <HI>Vrganda,</HI> she and I being alone in my chamber, she sent to fetch one of the bookes that had ben taken from her, couered with gold, whereon the Enchauntresse was ingrauen, and I remem∣ber that I saw therein the like carracters that <HI>Esplandian</HI> beareth on his body, and ouer them their signification, which is nothing else but his name and mine. Daughter (said the Emperor) if you haue the booke still, cause it to be brought hether: wherevnto shée obaied. The booke being brought, shee shewed him the place that <HI>Melie</HI> had read vnto her, containing that which followeth: The happy knight y<SUP>t</SUP> shall conquer the sword &amp; the great treasure inchaunted by me, shall from his mothers wombe bear his name in white carracters, and the name of her that shall be his wife in red carracters vpon his body, which red carracters shal be so diffi∣cult to vnderstand, y<SUP>t</SUP> no man liuing in that time how wife or lear∣ned soeuer he be, shall expresse the same without he sée this booke, which wil teach him what the seuen carracters do signifie, repre∣senting
<PB REF="135"/> the seuen words that follow, <HI>Leonorine daughter of the Emperour of Greece.</HI> In good faith (saied the Emperour) here is a strange case, and sheweth well y<SUP>t</SUP> the Enchantresse lady had more knowledge in art Magicke, then any y<SUP>t</SUP> liued in her time: and sée∣ing my daughter hath so wel deuined, I am determined that you, (said he vnto the archbishop of Thrace) do grant vnto <HI>Esplandian</HI> that which nature before his birth had promised vnto him, which is my daughter <HI>Leonorine.</HI> By which meanes the marriage was solemnised and finished the same day with no great ceremonies, the Court being as yet troubled for the death of so many Princes and great lords that were slaine in the battaile: but let it suffice to knowe, that those two louers enioyed the thing which they so long desired, <HI>Esplandian</HI> the same day being proclaimed Emperor of Gréece according to the commandement of his father in lawe: who within two months after, with the Empresse his wife went vnto a monastery &amp; place of deuotion. And because quéene <HI>Calafre</HI> had alwaies pretended to marry with <HI>Esplandian,</HI> perceauing her intent frustrated, she could not refrain to speak in presence of thē all, &amp; said vnto them: My lords, I beséech you giue me leaue to de∣clare my mind. It is certain (said she) y<SUP>t</SUP> those which know me are not ignorant y<SUP>t</SUP> I am one of the greatest &amp; most puissant princesse in all the cast parts, by reason of the great quantity of golde and precious stones y<SUP>t</SUP> are within my countries. As touching my li∣nage; I am daughter of a quéene of ancient race, and as noble as any y<SUP>t</SUP> euer was in the world: so it is that fortune brought me into these marches, promising me shortly to returne laden with great number of fla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es &amp; abundance of treasure: but to the contrary, I y<SUP>t</SUP> pretended &amp; sought the captiuity of others, and my selfe takē &amp; bet∣ter holden prisoner thē they y<SUP>t</SUP> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in their mortal enemies hands. This imprisonmēt wherof I speak, is not y<SUP>t</SUP> whervnto I am boūd by the faith I haue giuen vnto king <HI>Amadis,</HI> hauing vanquished me by force, which I certainely know to be wholly subiect to for∣tune: but the imprisonment wherof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> complain, is y<SUP>e</SUP> wherin my hart hath inclosed it self, &amp; hath y<SUP>e</SUP> only mouing by y<SUP>e</SUP> sole beau∣ty &amp; fauor I haue found in y<SUP>e</SUP> new &amp; most happy emperor estéeming my selfe to be such, y<SUP>t</SUP> I haued (leauing my law to accept of yours)
<PB REF="136"/> to haue had him for my lord and husband, although my hope by little and little began to deminish, when I perceiued the Princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> to bee more recommended in all perfections then any that euer I heard of, or euer haue séene: so that (speaking against my selfe) it had béene impossible to finde a more equall match nor more conformable one vnto the other, then the marriage of them together: which maketh me beléeue that fortune extendeth who∣ly to eternise this my passion, wherein I will (if I can) so much impeach her, that forgetting my first affection, and if it wil please him to giue me another husband worthy my estate, I will accept it willingly together with baptisme and the law of Christ which you doe hold. When the Emperour <HI>Esplandian</HI> saw her good pre∣tence, he began to comfort her in the best manner hee could, and calling <HI>Talanque</HI> (a faire lusty and wel disposed Gentleman) hee saied vnto the Quéene: Madame, this Gentleman I offer vnto you, is my cousin, and son vnto King <HI>Galaor,</HI> one of y<SUP>e</SUP> best knights as I thinke liuing in the world, I pray you at my request refuse him not for your lord and husband, assuring you, that I knowe no Princesse (how great soeuer she be) liuing in the world, but might content her selfe with him. The Quéene beheld him with so good affection, that shee easily beléeued <HI>Esplandian,</HI> and saied vnto him: Vpon your word my lord I wil accept of him, and from this time forward yéeld my selfe to bée his wife, and will for his sake doe so much, y<SUP>t</SUP> the Island wherin I and others my predecessors would not suffer a man to liue, shal from henceforth be gouerned by him as other countries are by their Kings and Princes. And because her sister <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e</HI> was not at that assembly, but with her ships lying in the straights (as Quéen <HI>Calafre</HI> had commaunded her as you heard before) shee desired the Emperour to send for her, who pre∣sently sent the admirall <HI>Tartarie</HI> to fetch her, she being come, and hauing heard her sisters mind, easily agréed thereto, and by the same meanes was married to <HI>Manely</HI> the wise, both espoused at one time, and being baptised, caused all their armie to do the like: which done, not long after those newe married couples, taking their leaues of the Kings, Princes, Lords, Ladies, and Gentle∣women of the Court, they imbarked themselues, <HI>Manely</HI> hauing
<PB REF="136"/> with him the vessels wherein <HI>Childadan</HI> his father arriued in the east, and <HI>Talanque</HI> those of king <HI>Galaor,</HI> which they caused to bee sraighted &amp; laden with all things necessary for so strange a coun∣try. And setting saile for Californie, not without great trouble, (which in the end they ouercame) they arriued in safety, where afterward they had many battels with their neighbors bordering about them, whom they ouercame, augmenting their dominions with many great lands &amp; territories. But because the subiect of our history is not further to intreat of them, we will for this pre∣sent leaue thē to goe on with y<SUP>t</SUP> which afterward was done in the city of Constantinople. You heard before of the loue of <HI>Norandel</HI> and quéen <HI>Minoresse,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> daily increased in thē more &amp; more, which the Empresse knowing ful well, caused them to be married toge∣ther, the emperor giuing to <HI>Norandel</HI> the castle <HI>La montaigne de∣fendu,</HI> with the townes of Alfarin &amp; Galatia, for the which he re∣compenced <HI>Frandalo</HI> with the rich, fertile and well peopled isle's of Galatines. Mean time the Emperor <HI>Esplandian</HI> not forgetting the imprisonment of <HI>Vrganda,</HI> one day among the rest (not long before the princes of the West imbarked thēselues to return into their countries) hee shewed thē in what sort <HI>Melie</HI> had taken her away, &amp; by inchantment caried her to the great citty of Tesifant, where she held her prisoner in a great tower, desiring them most earnestly to giue him counsel what he might do therin. Son (said king <HI>Amadis</HI>) it were good you sent vnto <HI>Armato</HI> to offer him for her the souldan of Liquie y<SUP>t</SUP> is your prisoner: &amp; if he refuse you so to doe, we will enter into his country and fetch her thence by force. Wherevnto they all agréed, so y<SUP>t</SUP> without longer delay <HI>Carmelle</HI> was sent to Tesifant, imbarking her self with four squires &amp; thrée gentlewomē, &amp; with a good wind arriued at y<SUP>e</SUP> castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> where she remained certain daies, staying for king <HI>Arma∣tos</HI> pasport which by one of her womē she sent to fetch, who fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Armato</HI> as melancholy as might be, féeling as yet his fortune past, specially the death of his son <HI>Alphorax,</HI> which without ceasing he cōtinually lamented. With y<SUP>t</SUP> the gentlewoman gaue him to vn∣derstand y<SUP>e</SUP> cause of her arriual, wherwith he was so wel pleased, that presently hee caused <HI>Carmelles</HI> safe conduct to bee made, and
<PB REF="137"/> giuing it to the messenger, said vnto her: My friend, returne vnto your mistresse and assure her from mee, y<SUP>t</SUP> shée may come vnto my court as often as it pleaseth her, remembring well the pleasures she shewed vnto me during my imprisonment. The gentlewomā thanked him most hartily, and returned to <HI>Carmelle:</HI> who within few daies after went to Tesifant to <HI>Armato,</HI> where shee declared at large the effect of her embassage, which heard by king <HI>Armato</HI> and considring with himself, y<SUP>t</SUP> for <HI>Vrganda</HI> hée might recouer one of his greatest friends &amp; therby cause the Christian Princes for a time to refrain the ouerrunning of his country, sent presently for <HI>Melie,</HI> desiring her in all affection (for his sake) to grant to his de∣sire &amp; the pleasure of the Christians, considring the offer made by thē was both aduantage vnto him &amp; his. <HI>Melie</HI> desirous to please <HI>Armato,</HI> brake her inchantments, &amp; without delay <HI>Vrganda</HI> was deliuered vnto <HI>Carmelle,</HI> vpon condition, y<SUP>t</SUP> shee being arriued in the city of Constantinople, should likewise set the Souldan of Li∣quie at liberty, which she swore and promised to do: which done, taking their leaue of <HI>Armato,</HI> they trauelled so long, y<SUP>t</SUP> they came vnto the castle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> where <HI>Vrganda</HI> caused thē to leaue <HI>Carmelles</HI> ship to enter into the great serpent that as yet she found there, which presently of it selfe began to saile, as it had alwaies done before <HI>Vrganda</HI> was in prison, in such manner, that without impeachment they arriued in the Hauen of Constanti∣nople, where the Princes and lords being on shoare, descended to the water side to receiue <HI>Vrganda:</HI> And thinking to bring her to the pallace, she desired the to stay there til a prophesie were accō∣plished, y<SUP>t</SUP> should be done before the sun went down, which they a∣gréed vnto: not onely to please her mind, but likewise desiring to sée what it should be. With that they were abashed that the great serpent began to leape and labour in the water; as if it had ben in the greatest storm y<SUP>t</SUP> euer was, although the sea was very calme, but only about y<SUP>e</SUP> serpent, where it raged in most horrible maner, but y<SUP>t</SUP> which most abashed the beholders was, that the vessell cast forth such horrible cries, y<SUP>t</SUP> not one among them but his haire stood vpright vpon his head for fear. And hauing continued in y<SUP>t</SUP> maner about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> more▪ the serpent thrust his head into y<SUP>e</SUP> wa∣ter,
<PB REF="137"/> wherewith it sunk and neuer was séen again. And with that they perceiued a farre off a great rock, which being driuen by the waues, came within half a bow shot néer vnto the shore, on y<SUP>e</SUP> top whereof stood a woman bareheaded, and couered only with a lin∣nen cloth to hide her priuities, being inuironned by more then a thousand serpents as wel great as small, which stung her in such sort, y<SUP>t</SUP> she wept and lamented in most pittiful maner, wherat the knights of great Brittaine had so much cōpassion, y<SUP>t</SUP> they thought to enter into the ships, and go to help her: which <HI>Vrganda</HI> forbad them. For (said she) besides the dangers that may happē vnto you you shal lose your labors, because she whom you behold (which is the inchauntresse lady) hath ordained it to be so. With y<SUP>t</SUP> the rocke sunk into the water, and the gentlewoman vanished out of sight, but not long after she appeared again vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> waues, flying from the fury of a monster of the sea, y<SUP>t</SUP> with his throat opē followed af∣ter, ready to deuour her, in such manner, that she came right vnto the hauen, crying with a loud voire vnto <HI>Esplandian:</HI> Gentle Em∣peror I pray you help me, for none but you can do it: wherewith <HI>Esplandian</HI> stepped forward, &amp; holding the sword hee conquered in the old pallace of the inchaunted rock in his hand, ran vnto her, &amp; thinking to go néere the monster, the gentlewoman y<SUP>t</SUP> fled from it caught hold of his sword, &amp; whether he would or not took it away, wherwith she threw her self into the sea, &amp; the monster after her. Whereat euery man began to laugh, saying to the emperor, that if a gentlewoman had predestinated the same vnto him, &amp; kept it long time, another gentlewoman or she her selfe vpon a suddaine had taken it from him againe. With y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Vrganda</HI> was led vnto the pallace, accompanied by the emperor with all y<SUP>e</SUP> kings &amp; knights: where not long after the Souldan of Liquie was deliuered &amp; sent to Tesifant, &amp; about the beginning of the next wéek after the we∣sterne princes took shipping: and being imbarked with <HI>Vrganda</HI> (recommending y<SUP>e</SUP> emperor to God) failed forwards, till at y<SUP>e</SUP> last euery man arriued at his desired hauen, namely king <HI>Amadis</HI> that found <HI>Oriane</HI> very sad for y<SUP>e</SUP> death of her mother newly deceased, which much more increased whē she knew hir father king <HI>Luisart</HI> was dead.

Those princes hauing vnderstood <HI>Vrgandas</HI> mind, failed not therin, so that about y<SUP>e</SUP> same time she willed thē to come, they all arriued there: where <HI>Vrgan∣da</HI> receiued them, not with a smiling coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nance as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er vsed or∣dinary to doe, but with teares in her eies, whereat they being much abashed, desired her to shew the cause thereof, which at the first she could not doe, her heart was so full of gréete. Neuerthe∣lesse, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shee too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> againe▪ and saied vnto them: My good friends, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of almighty God, al things haue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> tēporal things
<PB REF="139"/> should passe away, &amp; by death haue an end, according to the quali∣ties of his creatures: Which diuers great persons considering with themselues, haue trauailed (during their liues) in many sorts, after their deaths to leaue some memorie of them, not min∣ding to bury their renowme togither with their bodies. Now I know for certaine that the end of your daies is néere: wherefore it is most requisite, that you bée constant, and shew your selues to be the same you were at the beginning. Neuerthelesse before that death shall seaze vpon you, I will shew the loue that I haue alwaies borne vnto you, and with the helpe of God, will doe so much, that without death you shall remaine asléepe, vntill the time that one descended of your race shall deliuer you frō thence, and after that shall bée in as good case and raigne againe within your countries as you did before: otherwise assure your selues that before sixe moneths do come vnto an end, not one of you shall be aliue, but all buried in the earth. Wherefore let euery man shew me his opinion, and for the rest (said shee) let me prouide. Surely that spéech and newes of death was so harde for them to endure, that not one of them but changed colour, their hearts bée∣ing seazed with an extreme sorow. And as they beheld ech other, king <HI>Amadis</HI> séeming least astonished, answered vnto <HI>Vrganda</HI> and said: Madame, we know for certaine, that not one of vs, nor any other liuing creature can perfectly knowe what is necessarie for vs, but only you alone: wherefore doe with vs as you thinke good, and wée will all obey you: that is sufficient (said <HI>Vrganda</HI>) therefore let euery man put on his armour in the same maner hée vseth when hée goeth to the fielde, and each man hold his sword naked in his hand: that done, she caused them to goe into the for∣bidden chamber, setting them in their roiall seates, with all their wiues by them: which done, <HI>Vrgandas</HI> two cousens, <HI>Iuliande</HI> and <HI>Solisde</HI> in two basons of gold brought a certaine composition, wherewith shée desired them to wash their faces, which they did. Whereby it happened, that on a suddaine Beautie (which Age and Time had decaied in them) began againe to appeare within their faces, in as great perfection a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> euen it had done: which ad∣uenture please<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Ladies so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll that they began to behold ech
<PB REF="139"/> other, and their husbands thereat to be much abashed. Then <HI>Vr∣ganda</HI> called master <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> &amp; taking him by the hand, led him into the next chamber, where she caused him to sit downe, &amp; put∣ting the booke that he had brought into her hands, she made signes to <HI>Gandalin</HI> and the gentlewoman of Denmark that they should follow her: and passing through the Arke of faithfull louers they entred into the garden, where the images of <HI>Apolidon</HI> and <HI>Gri∣manaise</HI> were placed: ouer the which she set them and <HI>Ardan</HI> the dwarfe hard by them, wherwith she said vnto them: My friends, the true and faithfull louers haue béen worthy to sée these images before the Arke sometime inchanted, so you deserue this place for the faith and true and affection that you haue alwaies borne to your masters. Wherefore vpon your liues, sée you depart not hence whatsoeuer you shall heare or sée: that done, she went vnto the chamber where shée left the Emperour, and taking <HI>Carmelle</HI> by the hand, before them all she said vnto her: <HI>Carmelle,</HI> you were but of meane parentage, but the vertue and great curtesie of your heart hath so much inabled you, that you shall bée placed at the Emperors féet to fulfill the promise made vnto him, which was, neuer to forsake him while you liued. With that she spake vnto king <HI>Amadis</HI> and all the other princes, praying them not to flie till shée returned againe: and going vp into one of the towers of the pallace, shée tooke with her the best of <HI>Medeas</HI> bookes which <HI>Melie</HI> had, that sometime belonged to the Enchantresse lady: and being in the tower shée vncouered her head, with that she began to read certaine coniu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ations, and looking into all the foure quar∣ters of the earth, making signes and tokens with her fingers, her face became so redde. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat it séemed fire had issued out of her eyes. Whereupon there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>appened such an earthquake &amp; so great tempests of lightning and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hunder, as though the Elements had fought togither. This tempest continuing for the space of thrée quarters of an houre, those whome she had caused to sit downe (as you heard before) remained in a trance without all knowledge, as if they had béene dead: and with that there appeared a cloud so obscure and thicke which inuironed the place, that neuer after it could be séen, till <HI>Luisart</HI> of Gréece sonne to <HI>Esplandian</HI> brought
<PB REF="140" MS="y"/> that enchantment to an end, by meanes of a sword which he con∣quered, as it shall be declared to you in the sixt Booke: wherein is described one of the most pleasant and delectable histories that euer was read. At which time all the Princes and the rest were reuiued againe, and not before. The Emperor <HI>Esplandian</HI> at that time had a sonne after his grandfathers name called <HI>Luisart,</HI> as then about the age of eight yéeres: King <HI>Amadis</HI> a sonne and a daughter, the sonne named <HI>Perion,</HI> and the daughter <HI>Brisene</HI> that married the eldest sonne of the Emperour of Rome: King <HI>Ga∣laor</HI> two sonnes, the one named <HI>Perion,</HI> the other <HI>Garinter,</HI> of whome I haue shewed you before: <HI>Florestan</HI> the King of Sar∣daigne two sonnes, the one named <HI>Florestan</HI> after his father, that raigned after him, and the other <HI>Palmindan</HI> of Almaine after his grandfather: <HI>Agrayes</HI> Earle of Salandrie two sonnes, the one called <HI>Languines,</HI> the other <HI>Galmenes:</HI> King <HI>Bruneau</HI> one sonne named <HI>Vallade,</HI> and a daughter named <HI>Helisenne</HI> that married <HI>Quedragants</HI> sonne, and bare his fathers name: King <HI>Childadan</HI> two sonnes, the eldest called <HI>Abies</HI> of Ireland after his grandfa∣ther, whome <HI>Amadis</HI> slewe the first day hée entred into Knight∣hood. And although these princes left such heires as you heard be∣fore, yet would they not during their fathers absence, take on them the names or titles of Kings, hoping by Gods helpe, that they should once returne as well as euer they were. For the which cause they hauing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tained to the age and strength to bear armes, passed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reland, there to bée made knights by King <HI>Child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very weake and withered with age: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> followed strange aduentures, doing many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> feates of armes, which are at large declared in the bookes that followe, which in time may come vnto your handes, when it pleaseth God.</P>
