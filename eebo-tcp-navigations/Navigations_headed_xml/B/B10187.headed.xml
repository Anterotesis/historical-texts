<HEAD>A TRUE ACCOUNT Of the ACTIONS With the whole Defeat Of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army AT VIENNA By the IMPERIALLISTS.</HEAD>
<P>From the Imperial Camp about four miles from Vienna <HI>September</HI> the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The King of <HI>Poland</HI> has Joyned us, and all things are disposing for the relief of <HI>Vienna,</HI> which continues to make a very brave Defence; however the Garrison is much weakned, and therefore the Governor has let the Duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Lorrain</HI> know, that no time is to be lost. You have already had an account o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Action we were Ingaged in against a body of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> on the 24th past, to which we cannot add any thing, unless it be to doe right to the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Subjects, who had a share in it. Count <HI>Tafe</HI> Commanded in the left wing and gave Eminent proofs of his Courage and Conduct, and the Lord Lansdowne, who was with him, with other Volontiers; did distinguish himself with great Gallentry in the hottest of Action.</P>
<P>Lintz <HI>September</HI> the 9th The 6 Instant the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> returned hither from the Army, (which passed the <HI>Danube</HI> the 3.4. and 5th Instant, at a place called Stetzdort) and gave the Emperor an account of the resolution that have been taken for the Relief of <HI>Vienna:</HI> That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was to march with the Van to∣wards <HI>Maurbach</HI> and <HI>Maur,</HI> the main body commanded by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to∣wards <HI>walkersdorf,</HI> and Count <HI>waldecke</HI> with the Rear towards Closter Neuburg, That they intended to attack the enemy on <HI>Sunday</HI> next, &amp; that the Christian Army consists of 85000 Fighting men. The 6 instant arrived here the Elector of Bavaria, who parted again from hence yesterday with the Emperor for Closter Neubourg. Before his Imperial Majesty went hence, he received advice that the <HI>Turks</HI> had the 7 instant Sprung two mines, one whereof made a Breach in the Bastion of Lebels and that thereupon they made a very furious assault, in which they were repulsed. However the place begins to be in great danger, as we know by the signs the be∣sieged have made. The 7 the Emperess was brought to Bed of a <HI>Daughter.</HI> From Hungary we have advice that Prince Abafty, as likewise the Princes <HI>Walachia</HI> and <HI>Moldavia</HI> have orders from the Grand Vsiier to remain with their Troops near <HI>Raab</HI> to hinder the Incursions of that Garrison and of Comorra, and to secure the Convoys That go to the Turkish Army</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<P><HI>Ratisbonne September</HI> 13th we have Letters from the Imperial Army near <HI>Mautern</HI> of the sixth Instant which say; That the next Morning they were to March into the Tolne fields, where they were to expect the Troops of Franconia and Saxony; and the Letters from Lintz of the 9 tell us, that the Turks were ma∣sters of the Ditch of <HI>Vienna</HI> that they had sprung two Great Mines; one of which did not succeed, but the other blew up the point of the Lebel Bastion, and that thereup∣on they made a very fierce assault, but that they were repulsed with Considerable Losse That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> were Marching to relieve the place (which began to be in great Distress) and that the whole Army was Compassed of 64 <HI>Battalions</HI> of Foot, 500 in each, and 162 squadrons of Horse and Dragoons, in each 220 which amounts to 32000 Foot and 32400 Horse and Dragoons, in all 64400 men</P>
<P>Ratisbonne <HI>September</HI> 16 several Couriers have passed through this place since yesterday Morning; coming from <HI>Vienna</HI> and from the Imperial Army, by whome we are informed That on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 12th instant, the Christian Army attacked the Turks in their Camp, and totaly defeated them, that their Foot were all cut in pieces and their Horse fled, leaving their Bagage; Cannon, Tents, and all they had behind them, that the Emperial Army stood in Batalia all the Night following that they might be in a posture to receive the Enemy, in case they should rally again; That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> with his Troops and some of the Germans, were gone in persuit of them, and were not returned to the Imperial Army on <HI>Munday</HI> Noon; at which time Liberty was given to the Souldiers to strip the Enemies dead; its said the Imperiallists have not lost above 4 or 500 men; and that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> has taken two Horse Tails (which are the Turks signals of War) as like∣wise the Grand Visiers standard; and his own Horse, but that it is not yet known what is become of himself; the Letters we expect to morrow will give us with more certainty the particulers of this great Action</P>
<P>Brussels <HI>September</HI> the one and twentieth: Last Night arrived here a Gentleman from the Imperial Army, who brought the great and happy news of the raising the Siege of <HI>Vienna</HI> and the total defeat of the Tur∣kish Army on Sunday the 12th instant, of which he gives us these particulars. That the Christian Army consisted of 40000 Horse, and the like number of Foot, That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> commanded the Right Wing. the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> ac∣companied with the Electors of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the main Body, and Prince <HI>Waldecke,</HI> the Prince <HI>de Salme,</HI> Prince <HI>Louis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Bran∣denburg, Bareith,</HI> the Left Wing; That the whole Army advanced in this order of Battle towards the Turkish Camp with several small Parties of Horse and Dragoons before them to clear the way; That the Grand Visier had drawn up his Army within his Camp, having several advanced Bodies of Horse and Foot to defend their Retrenchments, and had they made a stout resistance, it would have been difficult to have forced their Camp; but that these advanced Bodies▪ not being well seconded, gave way, and put their main Body into dis∣order; That the Christians having without much opposition entred the Ene∣mies Camp, their Horse immediately fled, and the Grand Visier with them, That their Foot, being between 20 and 25000 men, made a considerable resistance; but being environed by the Christians, were all cut in pieces; That the Polish Horse pursued the Enemies Cavalry till night, and killed many of them, and
<PB N="4" REF="2" MS="y"/>intended to continue the pursuit the next day; That the Enemies Camp infinitely rich That all their Baggage and Cannon are taken, with 60000 Tents, and that in that of the Grands Visiers, was found two Millions of Money. That <HI>Vienna</HI> was brought to the last extremity, and could have held out but four days longer, the Garison being reduced from 15000 to 5000 men; However they made a very brisk Sally at the time the Christians entred the Turkish Camp, and killed many of the Turks that were still in the Trenches. Tis said the Enemy lost during the Siege 70000 men, besides those slain on this great day. Count <HI>Starenberg</HI> has given the Marquis <HI>de Grana</HI> a short account of their Deliverance, having Writ his Letter upon one of the Enemies Cannon. We were told that nei∣ther <HI>Teckeley</HI> nor <HI>Abafti</HI> was in the Turkish Army, and that there was not one <HI>Tartar</HI> found among them. In our next we may be able to give you a more parti∣cular Relation of this great and signal Victory, which cost the Christians not above 3 or 400 men; among whom are no Persons of any note, except the Duke <HI>de Crov's</HI> Brother, and the Count <HI>de Tratmansdorf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brusels Sept.</HI> 1. It is hard to express the Joy we are here in occasioned by the news we have of the entire Defeate of the Turkish Army; We first heard it from a Courier which arrived here yesterday morning from <HI>Passaw,</HI> but in the Evening we had the certainty of it by an Officer who came from the Imperial Camp, and from <HI>Vienna</HI> the 13. inst. the day after this Memorable Action, He tells us That the 12. about ten in the morning, the Christian Army attaked the Tur∣kish Camp. That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> made the attack on the side of the Empresses House called <HI>la Favorite,</HI> where the Grand Visier had his Quarters; The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> on the side of the Bastion of the <HI>Court,</HI> and Prince <HI>Waldecke</HI> on that of the Scotch Gate. That having without any great opposition entred the Ene∣mies Camp, their Horse fled, and the Foot was all destroyed, and all their Baggage Cannon, Tents and Treasure taken; during this action the Besieged Sallied out, and fell upon the Janissaries, who, as is said, to the number of 10000 had that day the Guard of the Trenches, and were in the posts against the Town, and, being likewise attackt on the side of the Army, none of them escaped.</P>
<P>The Mareschal <HI>d'Eumieres</HI> continues still at <HI>Lessiness;</HI> On Sunday last some Squadrons of French Horse were at <HI>Alost</HI> and <HI>Asch,</HI> and carried away several of the Inhabitans for refusing to pay the Contributions they demanded, 4000 Ducth Foot, and 2000 Horse are encamped between <HI>Malines</HI> and <HI>Doffle.</HI> and 2000 Foot more are marching to <HI>Gaunt</HI> to remain in Garison there under the Command of Monsieur <HI>d' Auvergue.</HI> The Cavalry of this Garison are drawn within the Coun∣terscarp, and encamped along the dry Ditch, and all the lower part about the Town is laid under water. We have advice that the Dutch Fleet is arrived at <HI>Gottenburg.</HI></P>
