<HEAD>From Odenburgh the <HI>3.</HI> of August.</HEAD>
<P>The Empresse being Crowned Queene of <HI>Hungary,</HI> they haue gone on in the Dyet or Parliament with the remainder points and Articles to make an end of the same: and first of all concer∣ning the receiuing of <HI>Germane</HI> Garrisons into the Frontiers pla∣ces, the Knights and Burgesses would giue no way to the same, notwithstanding the great perswasions of the Nobility &amp; Cler∣gie, which vsed all meanes and deuises to effect the same. Ne∣uerthelesse the Emperour desirous to haue an end of this point, caused them to meet againe, and handled so the matter, that the Knights and Burgesses, being ouermatched by the Nobility and Clergie, gaue likewise their consent vnto the same. But <HI>Bethlem Gabors</HI> Agent protested against the same, and the Committees of <HI>Cashaw</HI> went home much discontented.</P>
<P>Touching Religion, no alteration shall bee made before the next Hungarian Parliament, where shall be resolued likewise who shall be Iudge when the one party shall complaine to bee wronged of the other: The Catholikes will not leaue the de∣cision to the Palatine, nor the Protestants to the Emperour.</P>
<P>At <HI>Vienna</HI> is great prepration made against the arriuall of his Maiesty and the Empresse.</P>

<HEAD>From Vienna the <HI>3.</HI> of August.</HEAD>
<P>To day arriued heere a Post comming from <HI>Odenburg,</HI> (being sent to the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and the now ruling Duke of <HI>Bruns∣wicke</HI>) reporting that the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Dyete was happely ended, notwithstanding the great difficulty made by the <HI>Hungarians</HI> touching the receiuing of <HI>Germane</HI> Commanders, and Souldiers into their Forts and Strong holdes, in such manner that they drew their Swordes in the Parliament one against another, though in the absence of the Emperour.</P>
<P>But that neuerthelesse the matter was ended by most Voy∣ces, and agreed in this manner; That the Fortes and Strong∣holdes should bee beset with <HI>Germane</HI> Captaines and Ensignes, but <HI>Hungarian</HI> Lieutenants, the Souldiers being halfe of the one Nation and halfe of the other. Whereupon seeing that all is Concluded according to his Maiesties desire and expectati∣on, wee hope to see both Maiesties heere, within the space of 5. dayes at the furthest.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Vienna the <HI>5.</HI> of August.</HEAD>
<P>At this instant wee receiue Newes, that the <HI>Hungarians</HI> haue condiscended to the taking in of <HI>Germane</HI> Garrisons, and diuers other points, hauing the Palatine of <HI>Hungary</HI> taken great paines to the same effect.

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Vienna the <HI>10.</HI> of August.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Hungarian</HI> Parliament is finished, wee shall soone haue at large the Articles, and points agreed vpon, and it is certain that
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>they haue promised to admit <HI>Germane</HI> Garrison, and principal∣ly when the Enemy is at hand: as likewise that the Crowne shall be kept at <HI>Presburgh</HI> aswell by Germans as Hungarians, being of the one Nation as many as of the other. And there are diuers Hungarian Lords gone thither of late, seeing diuers thinges are yet not fully finished. The Emperour is likewise departed, and arriued at <HI>Newstadt,</HI> to Morrow wee looke for his com∣ming heere, from whence hee shall take his Iourney to meete at the <HI>Regensbergh</HI> vpon the Electorall dayes, where they are al∣together to meete, except the Bishop of <HI>Triere.</HI></P>

<P>Yesterday the Duke of <HI>Lichtenstain</HI> (as Deputy or Viceroy of <HI>Bohemia</HI>) gaue order that all Generals, Colonels, and Cap∣taines, should keepe their Souldiers in a readines vntill further commaund. It is thought that the Imperialists will set vpon <HI>Glatz</HI> with all their power and strength; wee haue certaine newes that yet of late 150. Souldiours are gotten in <HI>Glatz.</HI></P>
<P>Those of <HI>Klingenbergh</HI> being destitute of Prouand, haue been forced to surrender the Towne, and agreed with their Enemies that they should depart with their Baggage and goods, which they did and were but 120. strong. But the Imperialists ha∣uing tyed the Commanders hands and feete, they did send him hither.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Hollocke</HI> hath gotten his pardon from the Em∣perour. And it is thought that the Prince of <HI>Anholt</HI> will like∣wise speed.</P>
<P>The Electorall day is prolonged vntill the First of October next ensuing.</P>
<P>The Trumpetter who was the 2. day of this Month, sent by the Emperor to <HI>Glatz,</HI> comming from thence reported that the Young Count of <HI>Thurne,</HI> and all his Gentlemen about him were deckt with Hungarian apparell, to what intent he could as yet not learne.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>The 4. of this moneth wee haue seene here a great number of Storkes vpon the Mountaine of St. <HI>Lawrence:</HI> and the next day were many dead fishes, driuing with their bellies vpwards in the Riuer <HI>Moldaw.</HI> And we hold these things here for strange and ominous.</P>

<HEAD>From Breslaw the <HI>7.</HI> of August.</HEAD>
<P>The Bishop of <HI>Neus</HI> intending this next weeke, to march to∣wards <HI>Glatz,</HI> did begin to muster his forces, but hauing receiued certaine aduises, hee hath deferred his designe vntill better op∣portunity. Those of <HI>Glatz</HI> make yet dayly diuers sallies and ex∣cursions, bringing into the Towne all what they can get, proui∣ding themselues of all necessaries, keeping their Watches a league distant from the Towne.</P>

<HEAD>From Niewenburg in Saxony the <HI>10.</HI> of August.</HEAD>
<P>We haue here certaine newes, that the Towne of <HI>Glatz</HI> holds still for the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and is speedily to be succoured and rescued by the Marquesse of <HI>Iagerensdorp,</HI> who is at hand with diuers Turkes, Tartarians, and Hungarians, besides the forces of the old Count of <HI>Thurn.</HI></P>

<P>Few dayes agoe were here mustered 700. Horse of the Regi∣ment of Colonell <HI>Herbersteyn,</HI> which are to ride to the vpper <HI>Palatinate.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Franckfort the <HI>14.</HI> of August.</HEAD>
<P>In those parts the wayes are very dangerous, which hath cau∣sed the Princes, Lords, and Imperiall Cities to leauie and main∣taine at common charges certaine horse and foote, to cleanse
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>them of such robbers, murthers, and vagabonds, as assault the Passengers and Trauellers.</P>
<P>They write from <HI>Frankendale,</HI> that the Imperialists haue late∣ly taken <HI>Spiers,</HI> and hauing beset the Towne with 2000. men, they changed the Magistrate, remouing the old. The Citie of <HI>Wormes</HI> feared the like alteration, as likewise that the goods sa∣ued there from the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> should be confiscated.</P>
<P>The Imperialists lye in the lands of the Duke of <HI>Wirtenberg,</HI> and the Marquesse of <HI>Thourlath,</HI> endammaging mightily the said Countries.</P>
<P>We vnderstand that <HI>Leopoldus</HI> is to come in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> in the name of the Emperour. Likewise it is reported, that Colo∣nell <HI>Obertront</HI> is deceased at <HI>Heydelbergh,</HI> his horse are dismissed.</P>
<P>Wee are aduised that the Spanish forces are departed from the <HI>Palatinate.</HI> But the forces of the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Tilly</HI> are about <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>msheim, Praughheym, Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lebach,</HI> and other neere vnto the same. Thursday last they tooke <HI>Spiers,</HI> to day they set vpon <HI>Garmersheym. Heydelbergh, Frankendale,</HI> and <HI>Manheim,</HI> are strongly beset. Last Thursday was the Hospitall at <HI>Worms</HI> set on fire by the Crabatz, which are of the Empe∣rours side.</P>
<P>The Colonell <HI>Kniphawsen</HI> hauing left this Citie not past two dayes, there was sent one from the Emperour to charge him further: but vnderstanding his departure, he returned present∣ly backe.</P>

<HEAD>From Spiers the <HI>16.</HI> of August.</HEAD>
<P>The 9. of this Moneth is the Bauarian Army marcht vp from <HI>Lymen,</HI> with fiue peeces of Ordnance, euery one being drawne by twelue horse, and crossing the Riuer at <HI>Lulsheym,</HI> they sate downe in our Territorie, the next day came Monsieur <HI>Tilly</HI> in this Citie, but he returned the same day in his quarter. The same day in the morning arriued there likewise the Bishop of this Citie, and the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> came there in the after noone about two of the clocke.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<P>The eleuenth of this moneth, the said Armie went to besiege <HI>Germishem</HI> which they got at last, the four∣teenth by Assault, having before received great dammage by the Ordinance and shott of the Towne, they slew all what they mette; and at last granted quarter to the rest.</P>
<P>From <HI>Franckfort</HI> the eighteenth of <HI>August:</HI> It is certaine that in the Lands of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> there are gathered great forces, and are to meete at <HI>Halber∣stadt,</HI> to what purpose is not divulged.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Wirtenbergh,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Thou∣clach</HI> and diuers other Princes are leavying souldiers likewise; having divers Commanders of the Prince <HI>Palatine,</HI> the Counts of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Halberstadt</HI> in their countryes. The Bishop of <HI>Mentz</HI> is at this present at <HI>Spessert,</HI> to recreate himselfe with hunting.</P>
<P>From <HI>Hanaw</HI> the eighteenth of <HI>August.</HI> The <HI>Spanish</HI> forces hauing left the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> to follow the Count of <HI>Mansfield; Leopoldus</HI> came presently, thether from <HI>Alsatia,</HI> bringing divers Crabatz with him: who lye now almost all at <HI>Spiers,</HI> the tenth of this Moneth he went to besiege <HI>Germersheym</HI> being assisted by the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> and got the same the fourth day. His Garrison left within <HI>Spiers</HI> committed daily great outrages. The Cittizens stand in feare to be pillaged, as hath happened to these of S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Lambert,</HI> and other places more. What the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have spared, these are likely to destroy and con∣sume, having alreadie fired certaine Villages.</P>
<P>From <HI>Heidelbergh</HI> the 15. of <HI>August.</HI> The Em∣perours Armie, since it came before this Citie, hath
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>continually taken great paines to blocke, to in∣blocke the same. And now very lately they haue likewise taken a course to blocke vp <HI>Mainheim</HI> and <HI>Franckendale,</HI> for they have Wormes and all the Townes hereabouts, so that no provision can come to any of these Townes, by which we doe verily i∣magine that they do meane to starve these Townes, and so take them without besieging them at all.</P>
<P>From <HI>Collen</HI> the eighteenth of <HI>August.</HI> Those that haue besieged the Fort <HI>Papenmutz,</HI> espying that they doe no good with their Ordinance, shooting from the side of <HI>Berghs</HI> land, then to spend their Bul∣lets and Gun-powder, spare now the same, vntill their Sconse will be readie at this side, which will be to morrow. Of late a Citizen of this Towne, ad∣vancing himselfe vpon the Batterie called, looke in the Cap, or kyke in the mutz, was shott by the Or∣dinance of the Fort and brought hether dead.</P>
<P>But few daies agoe, there was a Souldier sent with letters out of the Fort <HI>Papenmutz,</HI> but being taken by the Enemies which are neere the Fort, he was hanged before day-light at a tree to afray the other. We live here dayly in great griefe and misery, many die suddēly amongst vs, before we can perceiue that they are sicke, other are infected with the plague, which invades and assaults vs mightily: Some are growne madde, being bitten by the dogges, that had eaten the dead carkasses landed there at the shore, as we wrote the last time at large.</P>
<P>From <HI>Middlebourgh</HI> the twentieth of <HI>August.</HI> At <HI>Ostend</HI> being two men of Warre, readie to set forth at Sea, our men that lay with their Ships before the
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>Towne attended vpon them, and Captaine <HI>Kleuter</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> gave charge to Captaine <HI>Iacob Vol∣kertson Vinck,</HI> to wayte vpon them with his Pinnace in the night time about the <HI>Geule,</HI> to discouer their comming forth, and as soone as they advanced to the Sea, he gave warning to the rest with fyring, and other signes. Whereupon our men cutting present∣ly off their ropes, sayled on, and mette them be∣twixt <HI>Ostende</HI> and <HI>Blankenbergh,</HI> and charged them with their Ordinance; But the enemies perceiuing that they could not come from the wall, did their best endeauour to returne backe againe to <HI>Ostende,</HI> but our men followed them so close that they were inforced to cast themselues on the shore neere the Shelfe about the <HI>Guele,</HI> where men of the States ioy∣ned their Ships in the forme of a halfe a Moone, made them quite vnseruiceable by their Ordinance, shooting against, from three a clocke in the mor∣ning, vntill three of the clocke in the afternoone. The Citie did send divers boates with men to them, because the Ships should not be taken, and did likewise play with their Ordinance vpon our Ships. But the foresaid two Ships and the boates have beene in such manner dealt withall, that 164. of them are slaine, 90. hurt: On our side we have lost soure men, having some few hurt.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the Gallies of <HI>Malta,</HI> and of the French King are arrived at <HI>Rochell,</HI> they never∣thelesse make many excursions both by water and by land, and have taken lately, divers Ships loaden with corne: And having taken by land, the Mes∣senger or poste of <HI>Bordeaux</HI> accompanied with
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>twentie persons, they offer to pay 10000. Crownes, for their ransome. The Kings Armies are yet be∣fore <HI>Rochell, Mompelliers,</HI> and <HI>Montaulban.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Berghen</HI> vp <HI>Zoom,</HI> we vnderstand that the enemies on a suddaine haue surprised three halfe Moones, but our men beate them presently out of them, the enemie lost in this service 600. men, and States 100. They assault the out-workes most a∣bout the Bosh gate, where they come many times so neere one another, that they are within the reach of a Pike.</P>
<P>Last Satterday arrived there two Companies about foure of the Clocke in the afternoone, and were that same evening yet imployed in a hott service, and the one being <HI>Switzers,</HI> mowed at that time brauely with their two handed Swords, amongst the ene∣mies. In this Skirmish were fiue hundred men slaine of the enemies, and fifteene onely of ours. The dead are not yet buryed, neither of this, nor the last Skir∣mish, it is true, that there was made a cessation of Armes for an houre to the same purpose, but the Cittie espying that the Spaniards came towardes their trenches in great troupes, shott amongst them, so that those that were not slaine, were glad to re∣tyre to their owne Campe.</P>
<P>There are of late landed twentie Companies, so that the Cittie is now of all necessaries provided, and in no danger, by the grace of God.</P>
<P>The enemie having raysed two Batteries, to en∣dammage by the Ordinance, the Ships and Boates comming and going, the Cittie hath dismounted
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>twice or thrice his Ordinance vpon the same, so that he rests now with the same.</P>
<P>Letters from <HI>Riga</HI> in <HI>Lithuania</HI> make mention, that the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> are by the meanes of their severall Ambassadors treating a∣bout a Peace in their Tents in the field. But they were at the beginning very likely to breake off, in regard that the Polonian Ambassadour, the Kingly Dignitie of the King of <HI>Sweden:</HI> And having at last given him his due respect, they haue had divers meetings, and it is very likely that there will be a Peace concluded.</P>
<P>They write from <HI>Genua,</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> is arrived neare their Territorie with great Forces: which caused them to haue an eye vpon him, and to looke to themselues.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bredaw</HI> are expected divers horse, and to the same purpose are their Stables prepared and made readie: And in <HI>Berghen op Zoom,</HI> and other places thereabout, are likewise great store of Forces to be sent, to what effect God knowes.</P>
<P>From <HI>Paris</HI> the 27. of August. And now for <HI>Mans∣field,</HI> and the Bishop that is with him. It is certaine, that the Duke of <HI>Bulloyne</HI> sent for him, and that he came to <HI>Loraine</HI> from the place where he was in foure dayes, which is one hundred myle. The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> could make but 8000. to resist him, so he was forced to compound with him, to giue him Corne and money, neuerthelesse, he burned and spoyled a great many of his Messages, so the Duke <HI>de Bulloynes</HI> plot was discovered, for he had promi∣sed to deliver into <HI>Mansfeilds</HI> hands three Townes
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>in <HI>France,</HI> whereof <HI>Saus</HI> in <HI>Burgon</HI> was one of the three, so he marched downe towards <HI>Sedan,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Bulloyne.</HI> The King hearing of this, sent a∣way from his Armie Duke <HI>Denawers,</HI> Duke <HI>de Angu∣lame,</HI> Duke <HI>de Lonigewen,</HI> to levell Forces for to re∣spite him with all speed; and as he marched he came to a Cittie which is called <HI>Munson,</HI> which is vpon the border of <HI>France,</HI> but not in <HI>France.</HI> And then the the Duke <HI>de Naweres</HI> and <HI>Mansfield</HI> came to a parley, so that the Duke brought him to the Cittie with him, and placed his Armie close vnder the Walles, and was faine to furnish his Armie with bread and victualles, so he told the Duke that both he and his Armie were at the Kings service, in giuing him foure hundred thousand Crownes, and a yearely pension, and shewed him seven Letters which the Duke <HI>de Bulloyne</HI> had written to him. This the Duke writ to the King: in the meane time, the French levelled great Armies, both of foote and horse. And the Duke entertained him, vntill the Kings answere came, which was done with great discretion, for the Kings Armies are now with the three Dukes in bringing to a head; in two dayes they are in severall places thirtie fiue thousand, and <HI>Mansfeild</HI> is twelue thousand Foote, and eyght thousand Horse: he told the Duke, that there is fiue thousand of the eyght thousand Horsemen, the best in Christen∣dome.</P>
<P>The Bishoppe perceiuing that <HI>Mansfeild</HI> would make his owne peace, and leaue him, there grew a Mutinie in the Armie: and the Bishoppe would haue left <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and haue gone to the Duke
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>of <HI>Bulloyne,</HI> but the Duke <HI>Denaweres,</HI> pacified them both.</P>
<P>This I thinke was to colour their intent, so in the end the Kings answere came, which was this; He would neyther of his service, nor his Armie, nor giue him any money, so the Duke <HI>Denaweres</HI> and he parted, and he went away without doing any harme, so <HI>Mansfeild</HI> went and conferred with the Duke of <HI>Bulloyne,</HI> in the fields in their Coa∣ches, and each of them had three hundred men; what the Conference was we know not, neyther can we tell what <HI>Mansfeild</HI> will doe yet. But he hath burned and spoyled in <HI>Loraine,</HI> and vpon the borders of <HI>France,</HI> sixtie Villages and Castles, and he is very rich in robbing the Churches of their Chalises and Crosses, and Images, and he hath fiue thousand Women or Whores in his Campe. The Duke <HI>de Bulloine</HI> so soone as he heard that <HI>Mansfeild</HI> was come into <HI>Loraine,</HI> levelled all the moneyes that was due to the King for this yeare, and fiue yeares to come, in all parts round about him, and forced them to make shift to pay him, and those that would not, nor could not pay so suddenly, he hanged them, and killed and hanged fiue of the Kings owne servants, that were there to receiue the Kings Rents. And now of late he hath furnished <HI>Mansfield</HI> with Powder and other things, and hath bought all the Corne he can, and brought it into <HI>Sedan;</HI> We shall know within these sixe dayes, what they will doe, <HI>Mans∣feild</HI> cannot goe backe againe, for the Emperours Armie lyeth in waite for him, and if he come in∣to
<PB N="14" REF="9"/><HI>France,</HI> neither he nor any of his Armie will euer returne backe againe. The Queene is going to <HI>Molenes,</HI> where the Queene mother is at the hot bathe. Newes is here that duke <HI>de Soulte</HI> was stayd and put in prison, and from thence both Queenes goe to <HI>Lyons,</HI> for there the kings meets them. Then here is none left here but Monsieur the Kings brother.</P>
<P>From <HI>Munpilliard</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> it is reported that the Prince of <HI>Condie,</HI> comming before the same, sent into the Cittie a Cardinall, with 3. other noblemen, to treat for a Peace, and in the meane time set vpon the Out-workes of the said cit∣tie, and tooke in one of the halfe Moones thereof, which the towne perceiuing, told the aforesaid noble men of their tre∣chery, and willed them to depart the citty before the Sunne was two houres hie, all which the noble men did performe, but they were no sooner out of the Cittie, &amp; come to their owne Forces, but the towne sent out forces, which tooke in againe the aforesaid halfe Moone, &amp; slew the Cardinal, &amp; a∣boue 300. men of note And of the Nobilitie were slaine, the Duke <HI>de Benf,</HI> cosin to the King, the Duke <HI>de Fronsac,</HI> son to the Count of S. <HI>Paul,</HI> cosin to the King, the Duke <HI>de Ensarx,</HI> cosin to the King, the count <HI>d'Alanx,</HI> son to the count <HI>d'O∣uergne,</HI> the Cardinal <HI>de la Valette,</HI> the son of the Duke <HI>d'Esper∣non,</HI> the Marquis <HI>d'Alu,</HI> son to Monsieur <HI>de Souddy,</HI> the Mar∣quis <HI>de Benleron,</HI> governour <HI>de falaise,</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Candsy,</HI> go∣uernor of S. <HI>Lo,</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Vandosme,</HI> Knight, the sonne of Monsieur <HI>d'Alincourt,</HI> gouernor <HI>de Lyons,</HI> the sonne of Mon∣sieur <HI>de Montigny,</HI> gouernor <HI>de Diepe,</HI> the eldest and youngest sons of the count <HI>de Schoubergne,</HI> the count <HI>de Rochefort</HI> son of Monsieur <HI>de Munthason</HI> governor of <HI>Paris,</HI> the Marischall <HI>de brandes,</HI> brother to Monsieur <HI>de Luines,</HI> the Marischall <HI>de Vitay,</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Montmoreincy,</HI> Admirall of <HI>France,</HI> hurt in two places with a Pyke, &amp;c.

<P>Your newes from <HI>Rochel,</HI> touching sinking of the Kings Gallyes, is not true: for there arriued the last Weeke a Barke at <HI>Barstable</HI> from <HI>Rochel,</HI> which was not aboue eight dayes homeward; and they report, the Kings shippes are in the Riuer of <HI>Brest Andbrenager,</HI> &amp; so vigilantly watched by 60. sayle of <HI>Rochellers,</HI> that they cannot ioyne; inso∣much, that doubtlesse the <HI>Rochellers</HI> will be Masters of the Sea this Winter, whereby all other the <HI>French</HI> Kings sub∣iects will be exceedingly disturbed in their Trade, and the <HI>Rochellers</HI> will be much encreased and strengthened, which happily may procure peace the sooner vnto the Prote∣stants throughout the Kingdome.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>¶ The Copie of a Letter sent from <HI>Breda,</HI> since the Arriuall of Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> relating the par∣ticulars of the late Battell, being fought on <HI>the</HI> 29. <HI>of August: With his Proceedings since.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFter <HI>Mansfield</HI> was arriued at <HI>Iambloies, Don Cordua</HI> with most of the Countrey Bores, got to a Towne called <HI>Leymon,</HI> by which <HI>Mansfield</HI> must of neces∣sitie passe, and so was constrained to encounter him: The opposition that came against <HI>Mansfield</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> was for certaine betweene 30. or 40000. Bores and Souldiers together, who had so strongly intrenched themselues, and placed their Ordenance, before <HI>Mansfields</HI> comming, that to passe through them, was very dange∣rous; which of necessitie they must doe, before they could get any passage towards <HI>Breda.</HI> It is most credible, that <HI>Mansfields</HI> horsemen, after they had encompassed <HI>Gonzales de Cordua's</HI> Forces, did so valiantly behaue themselues, that
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>on a sudden they were put to a great rout: so that Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> by meanes of certaine companies of his horse∣men, surprized their Ordenance from the Bores, the which they kept couragiously for the space of two houres, in this time they were imployed vpon the enemies, they ha∣uing not wherewith to defend themselues: so that by the meanes of losing their Ordenance, they were slaine in great multitudes. Yet notwithstanding, the multitudes of Bores were so great, being thrust forward by <HI>Don Cor∣dua's</HI> old souldiers, that they gathered a head, and obtay∣ned their Ordenance once againe. But before they were wholly recouered, the enemie lost aboue 1000. men. Be∣ing animated on both sides, the Battell at this time conti∣nued very fierce, wherein the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> behaued himselfe most valiantly, insomuch that hee receiued a shot in the left Arme, neere vnto the Wrest; and notwithstan∣ding this misfortune, hee would not leaue the Field, but fought still couragiously at least the space of foure houres; in which time he met with <HI>Gonzales de Cordua</HI> in person: whereupon the Duke (it seemes) not respecting his woun∣ded Arme, couragiously made two shots at him with his Pistoll, and it is thought one of them tooke effect, for here is newes come, that he is slaine. This is certaine, hee is at this time missing, and not to be found; but the truth of this you shall shortly heare. The Duke of <HI>Bruns∣wicke</HI> still prest further among his enemies, prosecuting the Bores, who swarmed about him in great multitudes, that in the end the Duke lost his Standard, and receiued another shot in the middle of his Arme, and yet would not leaue the Field for a good while after, as it seemes not regarding the two Wounds hee had receiued on his left Arme; which the whole Field, as well enemies as friends, admired to see his worthie to bee praysed valour.
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>A little before the Battell was ended, hee was constrayned to leaue the Field, in regard of the Wounds hee receiued on his Arme, the losse of which is and ought to bee la∣mented for by all true Protestants. After this, hee was conueyed out of the Armie, in a Horse-Litter made of Reedes, to some secure place for his safetie; but going with great hast, hee vnfortunately fell downe vpon the foresaid Arme, part whereof being cut off; which did so inflame the Wound, that he was enforced once againe to haue it cut off a little below the elbow. As for Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> he still continued the maine Battell, vntill three a clocke in the afternoone; about which time, <HI>Mansfields</HI> horsemen played the Deuill amongst the Bores, as themselues repor∣ted after the Battell. These aforesaid horsemen put the Bores to rout, and beat them backe amaine, and recouered the Ordenance from them; and indeed, was the chiefest cause that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> remained Master of the Field, as you shall presently vnderstand. These horsemen hauing obtained the Ordenance from the Bores, put them into such a feare, that they became wholly disordered: which aduantage the <HI>Mansfeldaans</HI> espying, fell vpon them, and flew a great number of them, most of them being Bores, and continually put forwards by the old Souldiers. By which meanes, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> obtaining the best, con∣strained <HI>Don Cordua</HI> to sound a retreat. Nay further, it is certified, that if some of Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> horsemen had taken an opportunitie, which fortunately was proffered them, they had vtterly ouerthrowne and discomfited <HI>Don Cordua's</HI> Forces; which, when he mustered about <HI>Lier,</HI> consisted of two thousand horse and eight thousand foot, the most whereof, were old and well experienced Souldi∣ers. In this fight it is most credibly reported, that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath slain very neere a thousand of the enemies,
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>amongst whom, was slaine a great Commander, <HI>Don Fran∣cisco Geuana.</HI> He hath likewise taken most of his Ordnance, all his Munition and Treasure, besides two Waggons of Plate, all which are safely arriued in <HI>Breda.</HI> Here all the Treasure was diuided amongst <HI>Mansfields</HI> and <HI>Brunswicks</HI> souldiers. Likewise Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath burned &amp; spoy∣led most part of the Countrey in his passage through it, as also the corne on the field. Here it is certified, that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> lost not in this Battell aboue 1000. men, but hee lost aboue 2000. but not all cut off by the Sword, as you shall heare. The Battell being ended, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> with his Forces departed towards <HI>Breda:</HI> but before his ar∣riuall there, hee lost 1200. the occasion of whose deaths, were the inhabitants dwelling in those parts; who vnder∣standing that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> was master of the field, and that he afterwards intended to march with his Forces to∣wards the Magistrats or Gouernor of euery Towne there∣abouts; gaue priuat command, that Springs or Ditches of Water which lay in their passage towards <HI>Breda,</HI> should be infected with strong poyson, and by this denillish inuenti∣on they lost within the compasse of twelue dayes aboue 1200, men, onely with drinking their poysoned waters, so that euery day they lost 100.: it seems by this that <HI>Mans∣field</HI> lost more mē by 200, that were poyson'd, then he had cut off by the sword in the battel. Before they were at <HI>Bre∣da,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> sent to refresh his army 30000. loaues, besides other prouision, which was welcome to the souldiers: after they were arriued, the towne welcomed them royally, shooting off all their Ordnance, making Bonefires, ringing of Bels, warlicke Instruments, &amp; good prouision for the common souldiers, withal the entertain∣ment they were able to make them. After they were well refreshed, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> trained them in good disci∣pline
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>of war almost euery day: he hath brought with him 6000. of the best horse in Christendome, and 4000. foote∣men; besides a great number wearied and sicke men, which come dayly to him in great numbers. I beleeue you had a false report was spred all ouer these countries, that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> had sent 3000. men to meete with <HI>Don Cordua,</HI> which losing their way, were cut off by the Bishop of <HI>Luckes</HI> forces; but for certaine, there is no such matter, for Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> neuer sent out a man to meete with <HI>Don Cordua,</HI> before <HI>Don Cordua</HI> himselfe met with him. It is certainly reported that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> had a skirmish with <HI>Don Cordua</HI> before his entrance into <HI>Henego,</HI> in which <HI>Don Cerdua</HI> had the worst; but afterwards hauing that great supply of the Bores of that countrey, did make a ve∣ry great opposition against Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> in which was slaine aboue 1000. men on both sides. At <HI>Mansfields</HI> first comming into the Prouince of <HI>Henego,</HI> the Bores of the countrey vnderstanding of his comming, had carryed away all their prouision, that for the space of foure or siue dayes Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> forces found no more to feede vpon then what the trees did affoord them, which bred a great weaknesse in his whole army: but shortly after they found very good pasture in that fruitfull Dukedome of <HI>Brabant;</HI> nay I do absolutely thinke it to be the fruitfullest and richest in all the seuenteene. It is further certified, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> hath gathered in a readinesse 4000. the brauest horse those Prouinces can yeeld, to ioyne with <HI>Mansfields</HI> horse. Moreouer there are to be brought to the Graue of <HI>Lipstat</HI> 2000. more, al which makes 12000. horse, which hath seldome been seene in the States iurisdictions. Further it is thought his Excellency hath ready in seuerall places, betwixt 30. &amp; 40000. foote: here is now great like∣lihood of bloody wars in this country, for that <HI>Don Cordus</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>likewise receiueth greater helpes from the Palatinate, and that the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> is comming downe to ayde <HI>Don Cordua</HI> with great forces. Here it is at this present repor∣ted, that <HI>Gonzales de Corduas</HI> forces are arriued at <HI>Antwerp</HI> and there remaineth, for that it is greatly feared amongst them, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> will besiege the same, ha∣uing so many forces in a readinesse. Here it is thought the chiefe rendez-vous of the States warre will bee in and about <HI>Breda,</HI> both to draw the enemies forces from great∣ly offending others, and defence of their owne, knowing that a warre maintained in the enemies countrey, is very preualent to weary, or ouercome. And it is thought, though that <HI>Mansfield</HI> wil plant his army betwixt <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Bergen vp Zome,</HI> to imbarre all prouisions from <HI>Spino∣las</HI> army, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath left the one halfe of his foote with the Duke <HI>de Boulloign,</HI> as also his munition: the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> is certainly more grieued for the losse of his Standerd, then for the losse of his arme. Some soul∣diers comming hither, bring newes that certain letters are written by the Dutchesse of <HI>Brabant</HI> to <HI>Spinola,</HI> wherein are disclosed diuers secrets of strange plots against the States and other Princes, to the States great aduantage. This day the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> being in the great Hall of the town, the Duke shewed himselfe with a merry countenance, and seemes prettily amended, and past danger at the cutting off his arme, beseeching God that he might recouer of his wound, to be reuenged of his enemies.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> forces that remained here, haue three seuerall times taken and spoyled great store of waggons with victuals that was carrying to <HI>Spinolas</HI> campe before <HI>Bergen;</HI> and also hath slaine their conuoyes, so that no vi∣ctuals can be brought to releeue the souldiers which are
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>in great want: what hereafter will follow, you shall weeke∣ly heare.</P>

<HEAD>From Zeland the <HI>4.</HI> of September.</HEAD>
<P>It is certainly reported that some foure dayes past <HI>Spi∣nola</HI> made a violent Assault vpon <HI>Bergen vp Zome,</HI> but he was repulsed with the losse of 600. men,</P>
<P>Also <HI>Spinolas</HI> souldiers, by reason of the small and bad pay, scarcity of victuals, and that all things in their campe are very deere, which eauseth them dayly to runne away, as many as can finde any opportunity, ariuing continual∣ly at <HI>Dort, Middleberg,</HI> and in other places else, where they thinke themselues to be freest.</P>
<P>It is also certainly affirmed by diuers letters from <HI>Hol∣land</HI> and <HI>Zeland,</HI> that all the townes haue consented to make vp 16000. of the Burgers to goe and lie in the fron∣tier townes: whereby if occasion serue, the old and suffici∣ent soldiers may ioyn thēselues with the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>It is further reported, that <HI>Spinola</HI> hauing intelligence that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> was ouerthrowne, did for ioy there∣of giue order that there should be Bonesires made in his Campe, and all his Ordnance discharged against the towne, which did put the towne into great amazement: but not long after the towne had order from his Excel∣lency for to make Bonefires, and to shew some ioy for the comming of <HI>Mansfield</HI> safely to <HI>Bredaw,</HI> which those in <HI>Spinolas</HI> leaguer perceiuing fire, were also put into great amazement, and some of the boldest spirits of them did attempt to draw neere to the towne, to view the occasion of the fire in the town: which the towne perceiuing, made way for the enemy to come to their owne destruction, for they were all slaine, but the number vncertaine. It is also reported, that the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> is comming downe to ayd <HI>Don Cordua,</HI> but with what number we know not.</P>
