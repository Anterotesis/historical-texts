<P>IT is so Customary a thing, the Dedicati∣ons of Books to Per∣sons of Quality; Especi∣ally, where the Author hath receiv'd any Obliga∣tions, that I might have been thought singular, had I not found some Person, to
<PB REF="3"/>whom Obligations had re∣quir'd an Acknowledg∣ment; and whose Judg∣ment and Approbation might have been sufficient to Countenance my Book. That, Sir, I hope will ex∣cuse my Presumption of Introducing <HI>Lisarda</HI> to you; A Lady, who though Vertuous to a Superlative, yet Unfortunate, till the Consummation of her Mar∣riage with Don <HI>Ricardo,</HI> and the greater Happiness of attaining the Honour to be Presented to you, fear∣ful
<PB REF="3"/>least her Misfortunes might follow her here into <HI>England,</HI> and that many might blame that here, for want of knowing the Cu∣stoms of <HI>Spain,</HI> which there is not thought a fault, no not a venial one: She fears our Ladies might be offended with so much for∣wardness in Spanish Wo∣men, which for want of a Spanish Confinement, they are not Guilty of them∣selves: These thoughts are what troubled her, till now that I assur'd her, You
<PB REF="4"/>were too Courteous to re∣fuse your Patronage to a Lady. But while she is thus happy in your Pro∣tection, give me leave to assure you, That I am, Most Intirely,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have offer'd you this Book without the Commands of any Person of Quality, or the ur∣gent desires of any Friend, only for my own Pleasure, and perhaps a little for my Profit; besides, I think it a pleasant thing, though I shall not im∣pose this Opinion on any one, nor think my self oblig'd to him who favours it; do but buy it, and let the Bookseller take your money; then Curse it, Damn it, and the Author, throw it away, or what you please. Nor have I omitted
<PB REF="5"/>my Name for fear of the Criticks, who I desire to have no more mercy on the Book, when once bought, than they have of their own unpitied Souls, who likely they may damn, by way of af∣firming the poor ignorant Author for a Blockhead, a Dunce, and Fool, with a long <HI>Et caetera</HI> of their ironical Ti∣tles; a thing that he'll but smile to hear, so that his Expectations are but answer'd, and the Book sells: And though likely you may be one of this ungrateful Gang; yet however, I will speak so much, and for the better un∣derstanding of it as I think conveni∣ent; partly to satisfie you in some particulars, but more for my own sa∣tisfaction: I must tell you, the Scene being in <HI>Spain,</HI> I have been feign to give them Foreign Characters, al∣though the Haughtiness of the Spanish
<PB REF="5"/>humour, and their aptness to be Jea∣lous, is a daily Discourse here in <HI>England.</HI> Yet least you should think my Don <HI>Ricardo</HI> and the rest, to de∣viate in good manners and sense, when they show those inseparable qualities to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> when they speak so much in their own Praise; I must ad∣vertise you, that Custom permits that there, which would be very ridiculous here; nor would I have you wonder at the forwardness of my Ladies, for they being depriv'd of that Liberty our English have, they make use of the Occasion, and always are very for∣ward in their Courtship; they without difficulty, will meet the Man they like, half-way; and 'tis not altogether un∣common there, for them to tell a Man at first sight they are in love with him; and now I think I have said enough,
<PB REF="6"/>except I should further tell you, that as you use me now, so shall I treat with you hereafter; either by writing more, if you Damn this, to vex you and please my self, or not writing: I know not why nor wherefore, but as the fancy takes me.</P>

<HEAD>Lisarda; OR, THE TRAVELS OF Love and Jealousy.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CLara Lisarda,</HI> a Lady but of sixteen years of Age, Beauti∣ful, Discreet, and one that had sixteen thousand Dollars for a Portion; was born in <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> of Illustrious Parents: Now the Posses∣sors of Youth and Riches we know are never homely, especially the lat∣ter is so attractive a Virtue, that that it self is capable to gild all Im∣perfections;
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>so that you need not question the number of Pretenders to this Lady, being every way well qualified; but however, amidst the throng of her Adorers, there was not one could reasonably think himself in a higher place of her regard than another; she was civil to them all, nor was there any one of them, that ever pretended to her, but hop'd with the rest; however she carried her self with such indifference, that none could complain, nor envy ano∣ther; yet with all young Women she very much desir'd the happy hour, that might perfect her frame, and satisfie a certain desire of some∣thing nature did dictate to her, for which end a thousand hovering thoughts advertis'd her, she was born, and that without this (she knew not what) she should never be happy: a thousand wishes and de∣sires, Curiosity it self urging her to haste the experiment of Joys, spoke to be so great, that the most copious
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>Language is too scanty to express. She many times would alone, at that instant, when each little <HI>Fibre</HI> of her Soul shot forth, warm'd by that ver∣nal Sun that still invites those of her tender years to new-born Appetites, discreetly reason in the following manner.</P>
<P><HI>Who is it can penetrate the heart and thoughts of Man, being so various, that the dispositions of most are changed as often as they change their Company; and yet as uncertain as their humours are, so certain is it my years require me to ac∣cept of one for a Husband? What shall I do then? shall I plunge my self into life-lasting Miseries to gratifie my wishes, and please my Parents?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Two things there are to invite Preten∣ders, my Person, or my Estate; My Person, No. It is not that; for I know many in this City, if not more No∣ble, yet far beyond me in Perfections; and because they are poor, Lovers are not only wanting, but even those that in jest should offer Marriage. Why then, if
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>'tis my Portion does these wonders, I find it hard to marry a Man who wooes not me but my Estate; and yet could I bear with this, (for Ambition is so grown into the World, that there must be a new Creation to find disinteress'd men:) who can assure their selves of their manners, where there are so many Cheats. In the time of wooing the most vicious appears a Saint, and detests all Vice: with what protestations doth the inconstant at that time avouch his Constancy? and how as∣sured of his Mistress's Vertue is the Gal∣lant, when many times afterwards, he proves murderously troublesome with his Jealousy; and all, how false soever, call Heaven to witness the sincerity of their Love: O! how they Adore, Admire, Esteem, with many other such like terms, till they have got their aim. His Friend stiles him vertuous, good,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>His Re∣lations will say that for him, He is good natur'd, and given to no remarkable Vice; another as a gallant young Gen∣tleman; Nay the Maid, the young La∣dies Confident, hath had the itching of
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>her Palms answer'd, to give her good word, and all this to her cost, who takes him for better and for worse; and gives her hand and heart to an Enemy, who either impairs the Estate by Gaming, or proves very ill humour'd, or what is worse, grows weary of the Person that adores him; so opposite are the humours of many Men to reason, that they never love less than when they are most be∣lov'd: thus it is with us poor Women, who fill'd with hopes of continued un∣speakable Joys, many times throw our selves into continued and unexpressible Miseries. Suffer it not, O Heavens! Desire it not, O Parents! For rather will I end this Life by a draught of Poy∣son, or Poniard, than marry, without making, not only for Months, but for Years, a sufficient Enquiry into the Man∣ners of him who is to be my Husband.</HI></P>
<P>Thus reason'd our discreet young Lady, and thus resolv'd not to mar∣ry; yet least she should erre in her Election, or rather because Love was but just conceiv'd in her Maiden
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>Breast, and had not yet strength ca∣pable of any more than directing that little Affection (she thought Friendship) to <HI>Ricardo Antonio,</HI> a Gentleman so well accomplisht, and of so great Parts, that in the judg∣ment of the whole City, he was only worthy to be <HI>Lisarda</HI>'s Husband, and she only deserving to be his Bride. At this time the City was oblig'd to Feasts, in that to shew their Joy for the Union between the two Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> Exchanging the two Beautiful Princesses <HI>Isabel</HI> and <HI>Juana,</HI> that with the tie of affinity their Friendship might be lasting. The Feasts were so much the richer, forasmuch as all the Rival-Servants of our Lady, with Emulation, set themselves forth, without regard of Expences; so that for many days were great Bonefires, Balls, Masks, and to end this Solemnity, there were prepar'd twelve Bulls of the largest size; this is a sport that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> extremely delights in. <HI>Ri∣cardo</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>on the last day of the Bulls was resolv'd to show his Activity, and to that intent, in the Morning, when the numerous throngs of People sur∣rounded the Lists, appear'd well mounted, with a Spear in his hand, applauded by all except <HI>Lisarda,</HI> who was concern'd to see him running in∣to so imminent danger. 'Twas now Love was resolv'd to dally no longer, and took this occasion to make <HI>Li∣sarda</HI> know, that even she with all her Charms, could not withstand his Pleasure; for now, though she knew not why she should be more con∣cern'd for <HI>Ricardo</HI> than for the rest of his Competitors; but willing to deceive her self (a frailty common to humane nature) she fansied it only a tender Friendship. She was so griev'd and uneasy, that she became restless. A terrible Bull was let loose into the Lists, when, according to Custom, the People gave a shout, which so angred the haughty Animal, that casting his fiery Eyes on <HI>Fulgen∣cio,
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>Ricardo</HI> he ran at him with such fury, that striking his Pointed Horns in his Horse, he toss'd Horse and Man in the Air. At the sight of this <HI>Lisarda</HI> sounded, and was feign to be carried home.</P>
<P>Every one was concern'd at this Tragical Mischance, but especially <HI>Ricardo,</HI> who, enraged to see no one run to the assistance of this Gentle∣man, who though he was his Rival, Generosity urg'd to endanger his own Life to rescue his; therefore throw∣ing his Spear, it went so strongly from the hand of the Caster, that it travers'd the Body of the Beast; who now more furious than before, ran with a full Career at <HI>Ricardo,</HI> but he nimbly drawing his Sword, and op∣portunely lifting his hand as he went to gore the Horse, gave so strong a blow, that he clove his Scull, and left him at the Horses Feet, confes∣sing that the strongest must surrender to the Fortunate; at this the whole Neighbouring Fields Echo'd with
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>the loud shouts of the gladded Peo∣ple, while <HI>Ricardo</HI> lighting from his Horse, lookt up to the Window where <HI>Lisarda</HI> sate; but his Servants telling him that they saw her carried away in a swound when the Bull so fiercely attacqued <HI>Fulgencio,</HI> he con∣cluded he was the Chosen from a∣mong the Crowd of her Adorers, and running to help him up, taking him by the Arm, said, Sir, Your fall to you is like that of <HI>Saul,</HI> for it hath made known your Election; and so retir'd extreamly discontented to his Lodging: where we'll leave him complaining of his hard Fate, and return to <HI>Lisarda,</HI> who as soon as she had recover'd from her swound, was acquainted how bravely <HI>Ricardo</HI> had rescu'd <HI>Fulgencio,</HI> and kill'd the Bull; and withall, that he intended to En∣counter a second in the Afternoon; this perplext her extreamly, and re∣solving, that rather one should guess at her Love, than thousands know it, by the evident demonstrations of

<P>A <HI>Certain Friend of yours, who hath been this two years perswaded you lov'd her, and one who hath a greater esteem for your Life than your self, since you venture it so rashly, that she can't look on without pity, hath desir'd me to beg you'd do her the pleasure to day, to see the Feast, and not be an Actor in them. If your Gallantry are the endea∣vours to gain her, know she is already yours; but if it is with design to please any other Lady, know that you are un∣grateful: Your disobedience will unde∣ceive her; this I desire of you for the love she bears you, which is not a little, since the danger you was in this Morning hath cost her much grief and trouble; this she desires, advertising you withal, if she is now deny'd, she will take her

</LETTER>
<P>When this Letter came to <HI>Ricardo</HI> by a continued thought of what had past, he had arrived almost to the height of despair, Cursing himself, and the hour he first saw <HI>Lisarda,</HI> and as the Servant knockt at the Door, he had just drawn a Poniard, with in∣tention to have ended his Life, but hearing some body at the door, he stopt and listen'd, knowing the Ser∣vants Voice, himself ran, and the Servant deliver'd into his own hand the Letter, which he retired to read bidding the Servant wait an Answer. A thousand thoughts pester'd him, he knew not what to make of the Letter; the Directions he knew to be <HI>Lisarda</HI>'s writing, but never ha∣ving receiv'd, nor heard she had ever writ to any of her Lovers before, he conjectur'd it was to discard him:
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>since she had made her choice of <HI>Fulgencio,</HI> least she might give him Ombrage, or cause Jealousy, by en∣tertaining still her old Suitors, she had writ to them all to forbear their vain Endeavours. This now past for granted, and he was resolv'd not to open the Letter, least it might draw Effeminate tears into his Eyes, there∣fore retaking his Poniard, he said, Come welcome steel, thy sharpness is much easier to be endur'd, than to see the happiness of my Rival; End my Misery; and as he was going to strike, says he, No. Though thy Charms hath made me miserable to that degree, that to avoid that suc∣ceeding Chain of Miseries that must needs follow, I will end my life. Yet in my last hour such is my Con∣stancy, I will kiss thy Name, paying my last devoir to the sign of my cruel Sentence, submitting — More he would have said, but having open'd the Letter to kiss the name, he could not so confine his sight but he read
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>these last words, <HI>If she is denied, she will take her leave of ever asking any Favour of you in all her Life:</HI> he ponder'd on them, but not being able to understand them, Curiosity lead him to read the rest, the better to understand the meaning of that line, but each word and syllable did not only change his Melancholy, but added to the first so many transports of Joy, that he was not able to con∣tain himself, but running to the En∣try where the Servant was waiting, with a rich Diamond, and some gold, he paid the Bearer, desiring her to stay but a moment longer, till he could write, which by reason of his excess of Joy he was not so well able to do, wanting that sedateness re∣quir'd, but as it was, here I give you the Copy.</P>

<P><HI>IF the endangering my Person will oc∣casion any uneasiness in you, for that same favour I would hazard it a thou∣sand times: but not to anger you (your Friend I mean) from this moment I desist from my intent, and thank your loving pity; this Complement, though I know not if I hit right, in calling of it pity, for excuse me to go into the Lists, that there I might see those sparkling Eyes, is a blessing I with much difficulty receed. But I had forgot, your Woman stays, and I stay, she for an Answer, and I that this might come to your hands, and that you may not take leave of asking me, but begin to command me as your Spouse (I was going to say), but as your Slave I mean.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter was extreamly plea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to <HI>Lisarda;</HI> but, O Heavens!
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>who can express the transports and ecstasies it caus'd in <HI>Ricardo;</HI> now the Feast was really a pastime to her, while to him 'twas tedious, he think∣ing he should never soon enough breath his thanks with gentle whi∣spers in her tender Ears; in short, he was ee'n mad with content, for the excess of all Passions is a real madness. The hour being come to return to the Feasts, he went, and by good luck was invited by <HI>Fulgencio</HI> to sit in his Window, which was next to that where <HI>Lisarda</HI> sate; 'tis impossi∣ble to tell you the agreeable meetings of their Eyes, who, if by chance she glanc'd any other way, as if so much pretious time was lost, with eager hast they return'd to their belov'd object. <HI>Fulgencio</HI> at first minded the Game, but having turn'd three or four times to ask his Friend his Opi∣nion of such and such haps, he still found him looking towards <HI>Lisarda;</HI> this made him take notice of them, and then, to his great Confusion, he
<PB REF="15"/>saw the reciprocal kindness between them; at this he was in so great a Passion, that with much difficulty could he contain himself within the compass of Discretion, Envy, Jealousy, Anger, and a thousand other Passions tore his Breast; in short, he found them prevailing over his Reason, and least by seeing more it should be over∣power'd, and that not being a fit place for a quarrel or disturbance, he slunk away without saying any thing, however all the time of the Feast our Lovers were too busy to perceive it; minding nothing but what each one thought most charming in his Object: How unwilling were they to be going when the Feast was en∣ded? and though they saw nothing of it, nor were at all delighted at that, yet were they extreamly sorry it ended so soon; but at last, with much regret, they parted; it not be∣ing the Custom in <HI>Spain,</HI> that of of∣fering ones Service to wait on a Lady home; and it is a great favour if he
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>is permitted to see her, though in Company with her Father or Mo∣ther.</P>
<P><HI>Ricardo</HI> being at home, and his head fill'd with nothing but thoughts of his Happiness, he bethought him∣self of a young Woman he had long kept, and considering if <HI>Lisarda</HI> should hear of it, it might be his ru∣ine in her good thoughts, and a let to his Marriage with her, which now he thought sure; for so 'tis in that Country, the discovery of the Wo∣mans love seldom precedes a whole Week to their Marriage; therefore the Person he had not visited but kept since his love to <HI>Lisarda,</HI> out of meer honour, he went to see her now with intention to rid her out of the Town, and in some distant place give her an allowance sufficient to maintain her, but no sooner he en∣ter'd the door, but she with a thou∣sand reproaches, upbraided him with his unkindness; and 'tis common with these sort of Women to think, if a
<PB REF="16"/>Man keeps them a while, that he is from that time tyed to them, and they may domineer; especially <HI>Don∣na Clara,</HI> for so was her Name, being of a good Family, but debaucht by one that left her, who now to shun the indignation of her Kindred, was feign to make a Trade and Lively∣hood of that way. She first began by the meer force of Love, through the unkindness of her Parents, who would not consent to the match. She really lov'd <HI>Ricardo,</HI> and her Love urged her to be the severer, nor would she hear him speak, but threatned to tear <HI>Lisarda</HI> to pieces; this urg'd <HI>Ricardo</HI> to think of another course, so that saying nothing, he went streight to the Corregidors, or Gover∣nour of the Town who was his Kins∣man, and one that really lov'd him, to him he told the whole affair, and desired his assistance to get rid of her, which he promis'd; then they a∣greed, that the ensuing night, about eleven a Clock, the Corrigidor
<PB N="19" REF="16"/>should come with a Coach and Guards, and with a feign'd Warrant seize her, and send her in a Coach to <HI>Madrid,</HI> where the Guards should leave her. Just as <HI>Ricardo</HI> came out of the House he met <HI>Fulgencio,</HI> who taking what he had said in the Lists, lifting him from the ground as a Jeer, having seen so reciprocal a kindness between the Lovers, at the Feast, through Madness and Jealousy, had been seeking him to fight him, and therefore now took the opportunity to tell him, without why or where∣fore, That he must fight him. <HI>Ricardo</HI> told him he could not then, but on the Morrow at twelve at Night, he would be at such a House, and his Whistle should be a sufficient token to know who staid for him, and then he would satisfie his desires; on these Promises they parted: No sooner was he come home to his own House, but found a Letter to this purpose.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="17"/>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To <HI>Ricardo.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>SInce not only by your Letter, but by your behaviour at the Feasts, I must needs conjecture, you think that 'tis my self that loves you, I would see what 'tis you'd do to deserve that love; therefore my Father and Mother being out of Town, in the Morning I'd be glad to hear your Proposals.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Lisarda.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Ricardo</HI> receiv'd this with much joy, and read it several times; such delight he took in it, kissing the Name, and a thousand times squee∣zing it to his heart; he admir'd the freedom and easiness of the stile: in short, such was the ecstasie that rest nor sleep he could not, but lay me∣ditating all Night on the Charming Mistress of his Heart: how oft did he wish 'twas day, and when 'twas day wish it were a decent hour to wait on <HI>Lisarda,</HI> feign would go, but still
<PB N="21" REF="17"/>was afraid it was too early; a thou∣sand turns he made about the room, and through the eagerness of thought walked so fast, one would have thought it had been for a wager; then would he stop to tell the Clock, and stamp and fume to hear it strike too few. In short, surely no Lover was ever in a greater Agony; at last he heard nine strike, when with eager∣ness he call'd to his Servant to follow him, and away he went. When he came there, <HI>Lisarda</HI> perhaps with as much impatience was expecting him, so that he was Conducted to her Chamber. Their Eyes at the sight of each other declar'd the joy of their hearts; what pass'd further in mat∣ter of Courtship, I will leave every one to guess. And only tell you this, The time was agreed on for the Mar∣riage.</P>
<P>But who would think it, that a∣midst of all this happiness, Fortune, whose delight seems to be baffling our surest hopes, should so suddenly
<PB N="22" REF="18"/>Eclipse the Amorous Flame of our two Lovers, and that not for a while, but put them in a condition of never performing the Articles a∣greed between them. Amidst all the sweet Discourses and pleasing words, <HI>Ricardo</HI> bethought himself of his troublesome Mistress, and impatient least it should be discover'd; he took his leave of the Vertuous <HI>Lisarda,</HI> not without giving her hopes of seeing him again that day; he goes directly to his Servants House, where he kept <HI>Clara Euphegenia,</HI> that being her Name; he came with a very pleasing Countenance, telling her, that what he said or did yesterday, was only to try how she lov'd him; this he did that she might not suspect him for what should follow; he din'd with her, and staid with her till near four of the Clock, in which time he show'd so much love, and Caress'd her so handsomely, that she could not doubt but he was sincere; he went to the Corregidors to see if all
<PB N="23" REF="18"/>things were ready against the hour appointed; from thence he went to <HI>Fulgencio Ricardo</HI>'s House, thinking to answer his Challenge then, be∣cause he thought at Night he might be too busy, but not finding him within, he went to pass a part of the Evening in the Fields; a Servant of <HI>Lisarda</HI>'s saw him, and told her Mi∣stress, that she saw <HI>Ricardo Antonio</HI> going to walk in such a place; it be∣ing duskish, and her Father and Mo∣ther not at home, she took a Servant with her, thinking to meet him; as she was going out, <HI>Fulgencio Ricardo</HI> was in a House hard by, and saw her, and follows her; going into the Fields she pass'd by the House where her Lover <HI>Ricardo Antonio</HI> entred, and heard him say to the Servant who open'd the door, Don't shut, for I shall be going again. She staid be∣fore the door a while, at last she bid the Maid ask a Neighbour, who was owner of that House; the honest Man told the Maid, that 'twas a Servant
<PB REF="19"/>of Don <HI>Ricardo Antonio</HI>'s who ow'd the House, but he believ'd the Master had most sport in't; this being told to <HI>Clara Lisarda,</HI> she was curious to know what sport that might be, and bidding her Maid wait, she went in, but being in the first room, the door of the second stood half open, from whence our Lady heard these words; <HI>Ah, my Dear</HI> Clara, <HI>Don't imagine or think, that I can be false to thee; It is to have little Confidence in thine own Charms;</HI> Knowing this Voice to be <HI>Ricardo</HI>'s, she carefully lookt through the opening of the door, and saw her Lover lying on <HI>Clara</HI>'s Lap: <HI>O, Ye just Powers!</HI> said she to her self, <HI>Is this possible! Could silly, easy</HI> Lisarda <HI>have believ'd it, had not her Eyes and Ears been Witnesses of his Ingratitude:</HI> Hear she stopt hearing <HI>Ricardo</HI> speak∣ing thus: <HI>My Dear</HI> Clara, <HI>I don't de∣ny, that for my Friends satisfaction I gave out, and pretended to love</HI> Lisarda, <HI>but that was, that I might with secrecy give a full soope to my wishes, and thy
<PB N="25" REF="19"/>Dear Embraces. What is</HI> Lisarda <HI>com∣parable to thee, but as a false Glass to a Diamond.</HI> Here <HI>Lisarda,</HI> not having Patience, rusht into the Room. How much astonisht our Cavallero was, I leave it to the Reader to imagine, while she spoke thus.</P>
<P><HI>Beautiful Lady, I can't deny, the Pain, Grief and Trouble, with which I come into your Presence, for though I would I should have a thousand Accusers, my Voice, my Affections, my Colour, my Pain, my troubled Words would discover the Cheat; but be not troubled at my coming, for I assure you, I have no de∣sign, if I could, which would be impossi∣ble, he being withheld by your all-power∣ful Charms, to rob you of the Gallant, who so justly enjoys your good will, that you ought to love him for his many good Parts, I mean as to his Body, for as to the rest, Heaven never fram'd a Man so false, so ungrateful a Creature, that you may pardon me this rudeness, and not believe his Vows and Protestations. Hear me if it will not be troublesome to you;</HI>
<PB REF="20"/>Then taking a Seat, with more Tears than Words, and more Sighs than Tears, her Heart ready to burst, turning to <HI>Ricardo,</HI> she said, <HI>Think not, Ʋngrateful Man, that these Com∣plaints should be heard by you, were they not usher'd by force: I am torn with Jealousy and Rage, and my Heart would burst if I did not speak.</HI> Here <HI>Ricardo</HI> heard his Signal, and finding <HI>Lisarda</HI> to be in too great earnest for him to hope, and fearful least <HI>Clara,</HI> in his absence, might offend her, he shut <HI>Clara</HI> in the next Room, and hoping to have comply'd with his honour and return, or rather not know what he did, nor thinking what he was to do, he went down to <HI>Fulgencio,</HI> whom he would have put off for an hour or two, but <HI>Fulgencio</HI> told him, he had had enough of <HI>Lisarda</HI>'s Company, and if he would not go to a more convenient place, he'd give him an occasion to draw there; <HI>Ricardo</HI> see∣ing himself thus press'd went with him, where we must leave them a∣fighting,
<PB N="27" REF="20"/>and return to our two La∣dies, who while they were discour∣sing through the Door, hearing a noise below, <HI>Lisarda,</HI> for fear of being known, Veil'd her self, when imme∣diately the Corregidor came up, and seeing her took her for <HI>Dona Clara,</HI> and deliver'd her to the Guards, who put her into the Coach, and carried her towards <HI>Madrid.</HI> In the mean while <HI>Clara,</HI> with her Maid, made their escape out of a Window; and as she was going she knew not where, <HI>Fulgencio</HI> meeting her suppos'd her to be <HI>Lisarda,</HI> and accosted her in this manner. <HI>Madam, Might I be never so happy in any other Woman, I would not exchange the Hell wherein you have put me, not for that happiness:</HI> And she mistaking him for <HI>Antonio,</HI> An∣swer'd, <HI>Then 'twas a great Hell to you to hear my Rival Rage to night. Alas</HI> Antonio, <HI>I thought you could not have been in pain while you possest my heart; at least you have often told me so:</HI> He perceiving she mistook him for t'other
<PB N="28" REF="21"/>was overjoy'd, not knowing he him∣self was mistaken, but on the con∣trary, by his having seen her in the street go into <HI>Antonio</HI>'s; her discourse of having seen him that night, and his seeing <HI>Antonio</HI> go in just before her, had not any scruple, but really thought it was the Person he took her for; and since she took him for his Rival, not being able to worst <HI>Antonio</HI> by the Sword, he thought now to revenge himself by a trick, and so proceeded. <HI>Well, Madam,</HI> said he, <HI>Since we love sincerely, let me beg of you, before you go further, to give me the assurance, you'll be ever mine: How shall I do that,</HI> replied <HI>Clara? Why, Madam, for several urgent reasons, for your advantage as well as mine, we may be married now, and keep it private till</HI> — Here cutting off his words, not having power to contain her self for Joy, said, <HI>Ay, my</HI> Antonio, <HI>I Con∣sent, You know I can refuse you nothing.</HI> So presently they went to a Priest, who was at <HI>Fulgencio</HI>'s Devotion, or
<PB N="29" REF="21"/>rather was devoted to the gold he expected, who married them by the light of one single Lamp that hung i' the Church, so that neither per∣ceiv'd their mistake. Now was <HI>Ful∣gencio</HI> in his highest Orb of bliss, and wrapt in the delicious thoughts of having sufficiently reveng'd himself of <HI>Ricardo,</HI> who though in the Duel had disarm'd him, yet Honour had oblig'd him to restore his Sword, but he being possess'd of his Mistress, thought himself oblig'd by honour to keep her; and having gratified the Priest, he told her, she should not go home that night, but lodge with him; to which she as easily consen∣ted, as to the Marriage: What co∣ver'd extreamly the mistake was, as in all Foreign Countries, having two Names, <HI>Fulgencio</HI> could answer by that of <HI>Ricardo,</HI> and designedly did so, <HI>Clara</HI> was the first Name of <HI>Lisarda</HI>'s as well as hers, whom we call by that Name; but now to leave them go∣ing, and to return to <HI>Ricardo,</HI> who
<PB N="30" REF="22"/>was got to his Servants House, not dreaming of what had happen'd, nor indeed reflecting on his own Errour by locking <HI>Clara</HI> up. So that the Corre∣gidor, (had he not found <HI>Lisarda</HI> whom he mistook for her) could not have accomplisht the design, though now 'twas undesignedly that he had not don't, but committed a gross errour. <HI>Ricardo</HI> no sooner entred the House, but he enquir'd for his offended <HI>Li∣sarda,</HI> to whom the Servant told the mistake; but how shall I describe the Fury, the Madness rather, that sei∣zed him at this News; now had he need of all his Prudence to govern himself in this misfortune: He in∣quir'd for <HI>Clara,</HI> they told him she was also gone; he ordered his Horse presently to be Sadled, and mounting thereon, he went to the Corregidor's House, told him the mistake, but desir'd in all haste to have Orders to bring her back, which he had no sooner receiv'd, but Posted after the Coach in all haste; he had not got∣ten
<PB N="31" REF="22"/>above three Leagues from the Town, before he had sight of a Coach, to which he rid up, Crying out, Stay, it is a mistake, and I have Orders from the Corregidor; still he perceiv'd the Coach to drive on faster; he knew not what it should be that occasion'd them to drive from him; but in a little while he overtook them, Commanding the Coach to stop, off flew a Pistol, <HI>Ricardo</HI> lets fly again, and here begins a Fight, for both their Pistols being discharg'd, <HI>Ful∣gencio</HI> call'd to him, and told him, if he'd dismount he'd try if Fortune would continue her favours to him, with this our noble <HI>Cavallero</HI> dis∣mounted, and <HI>Fulgencio</HI> stept out of the Coach; but <HI>Ricardo,</HI> a Man of great Dexterity, a second time dis∣arm'd his Adversary, and being no less Generous than Valiant, return'd him his Sword, and when he came to examine the business, it was the discovery of a double deceit: First instead of <HI>Lisarda,</HI> whom both thought
<PB N="32" REF="23"/>was in the Coach, they found <HI>Clara Ricardo</HI>'s late Mistress, and to <HI>Ful∣gencio</HI>'s great perplexity, his now Wife; he no sooner knew who 'twas but he would have disown'd her, but in vain, for he had told <HI>Ricardo</HI> in his Capitulation, that on condition he would Promise not to meddle with a Lady in the Coach, who he had that Night Married, he would sur∣render, but without that Promise, Dis∣arm'd as he was, the Dispute should continue, and assuring him it was no Person sent by Command of the Cor∣regidor, and consequently not the Per∣son he sought for; <HI>Ricardo</HI> had granted his Request, deliver'd him his Sword, and went to wish the La∣dy Joy; when, Gods! what a sur∣prize was it to him to see <HI>Clara;</HI> had he been capable to have receiv'd any Pleasure amidst that throng of Vexations, undoubtedly this would have been a great one to see himself so well rid of so troublesome a Mi∣stress; but being two contraries they
<PB N="33" REF="23"/>are never at once to be found in one Breast. <HI>Ricardo</HI> after he had wisht her Joy, took his leave, telling <HI>Ri∣cardo,</HI> he had best make the best on't, and so bid him farewel; riding away as fast as possible he could to overtake <HI>Lisarda,</HI> which after two hours ri∣ding he did, but such was his Love, such was his Grief, and the sence of his offence, that not able to speak, Floods of Tears ran down from his Eyes; at last he made shift to tell the Officers that were with her, that he had Orders from the Corregidor to bring that Lady back to Town; and delivering the Paper to them, she told him, that they'd turn after they got to the next House, that they might have light to read by; <HI>Lisarda</HI> was extreamly pleas'd to see that the mistake was likely to give her no fur∣ther trouble; and as soon as they came to a House they wak't the Peo∣ple, and got light; finding they were to return with the Lady, they told <HI>Ricardo,</HI> that if he pleas'd he might
<PB N="34" REF="24"/>step in the Coach, and one of them would take care of his Horse, which he accepted of, being very well pleas'd with the offer; feign would he have spoke and excus'd himself with the fair <HI>Lisarda,</HI> but Grief so oppress'd his Mind, and fear, being conscious of some guilt, depriv'd him of the Power. In the mean while <HI>Lisarda</HI> knew not what to make of these unhappy Occurrences of that Night, and was as desirous to know, could her haughty Soul have permit∣ted her to ask, of one she thought so great an Offender against her; but nor one, nor t'other, said any thing of the matter. While they both sate thus silent, of a sudden six Men, three at each door of the Coach (having sent as many before to stop it) Pre∣sent their Pistols in the Coach, swearing, if they would not deliver the Lady, they'd Pistol every Man: although <HI>Ricardo</HI> could not think to be Victor, having none but himself, and one of the Guards, the t'other that
<PB N="35" REF="24"/>mounted <HI>Ricardo</HI>'s Horse, having at the sight of so numerous an Enemy rid away, yet he drew his Pistols, ta∣king one in each hand, gave them no other reply, but shot; their Horses unruly, and themselves startled at so unexpected a thing, besides the flash∣es having for a while deprived them all of sight, and the shot three of their Lives, <HI>Ricardo</HI> made shift to get out of the Coach, saying to <HI>Li∣sarda, Madam, I am far from being sorry for this occasion, of shewing how tenderly I love you; if I live I hope to clear my self of what things have hap∣pen'd to night; but if 'tis my fortune to be kill'd, let me beg you to entertain a Charitable Opinion for me:</HI> Then ta∣king the advantage of the unruliness of their Horses which had thrown one, whom <HI>Ricardo</HI> that moment dis∣patcht, he fiercely ran at t'other two; in the mean while he heard the Coach go on, and looking back, he receiv'd a Pistol through his Body, which laid him on the ground, while
<PB REF="25"/>his Enemies rid after the Coach; he feign would have follow'd, but his strength was so much diminisht by the loss of blood, that he was not able to rise; and at that time of Night, being some distance from any Town, there was no hopes of getting help till the Morning; but still his weak sight follow'd the Coach, and his anxious Mind kept Company with the object of his Vows: <HI>O Gods,</HI> said he, <HI>what is it I must endure these few moments I have to live; how do my wild thoughts torture my languishing Soul: Did but</HI> Lisarda <HI>know the truth, Did she but conceive my intentions that have caus'd all these Misfortunes, I might perhaps die with some Pleasure, to know she did not think me that ungrateful false Man. O</HI> Lisarda, Lisarda, <HI>had for∣tune but favour'd me, how might we have been, nay how happy should I esteem my self in these few agonizing minutes. Could I but hear from thy Dear Mouth one kind word to thy unfortunate</HI> Ri— Here his Speech failed him, and his
<PB N="37" REF="25"/>Breath seem'd spent, remaining in the Field without motion. It hap∣pen'd the discharging so many Pistol shot, had given an alarm to two or three Houses not far distant, and though the Cowardly Bores dar'd not to come till they heard no more shot, yet thinking now they might satisfie their Curiosity, since they had heard the Coach drive, and Men gal∣loping after; it began now to grow a little lightsome, the Day drawing near, when these Clowns came where the Corps of five Men lay besmear'd with gore; they began to consider with themselves what was best to be done, they had a mind to the Plun∣der, but fear'd some ones coming on the rode might deprive them of stay∣ing to take their Booty; therefore one seeing his Son <HI>Jack</HI> driving a Cart to the Field, call'd to him, and lay∣ing the Bodies in the Cart, drove home, where they fell to ransacking the Corps of the dead Men; but while the rest were busy about the
<PB REF="26"/>other four, one went to handle <HI>Ri∣cardo,</HI> and stirring and turning him to pluck of his Cloths, he not being quite dead, but only in a swound, it recover'd him, and while the Fellow was about to pluck of his Breeches, he felt so sensible a Box on the Ear, that it stunn'd him; this frightned some of the Clowns so, that they ran away, while another more hardy and wicked, up with a stick, and laid <HI>Ricardo</HI> such a blow on the Head, that down he fell; but now see the Guards of the Corregidor enter, and seize upon all in the House; for some Houses nearer the Town, ha∣ving acquainted the Corregidor of what they had heard, he sent these Guards to inquire into the business, and finding the place where they lay with some fresh blood, they follow'd the tracts of the Cart-Wheel, that began in that place, this lead them to the House; they bound the Bores, and laying the Corps in the same Cart that brought them, (which
<PB N="39" REF="26"/>they knew by its being bloody) ty∣ing the Bores to the Carts-Tail, and so began to drive on; when of a sud∣den, <HI>Ricardo</HI> a second time began to recover. He was strangely surpriz'd when his faint Eyes beheld himself with those Corps in the Cart; with much ado he made shift to speak, when one of the Guards hearing knew his Voice, though almost as much altered by faintness, as his Face by dust and gore. They presently took Handkerchiefs, and ty'd up his Wounds. When they came to Town, they put him in a Coach to be carried to his House; and the Bores were carried before the Corregidor, who committed them to Gaol. Many peo∣ple flock about the Cart, where one knew his Fathers Body, another her Husbands; in short, they all found Friends to mourn for them and bury them; but innumerable were the im∣precations laid on the Bores; the whole Town was so inrag'd, that as they were going to Gaol, would have tore
<PB N="40" REF="27"/>them to pieces, the severest Death to be imagin'd threatned them; the Corregidor being inrag'd at the usage of his Cousen <HI>Ricardo,</HI> and the peo∣ple at the usage of their Friends; so that the poor Bores were loaded with Irons, and laid in a Dungeon; where we'll leave them biting their Nails, and Cursing their Misfortunes like distracted Men.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>NOW do not I know whether with truth I should begin with Gentle, Courteous, or Kind Reader; for perhaps you deserve none of these Epithets; exa∣mine your Conscience, and if you find your self clear from having abus'd either Book or Author, send me but word of it, and I have left sufficient to have any of those to begin with: But if you had ra∣ther show your Wit, and exercise your Talent in Criticism; perhaps I shall give you subject enough to work on in this se∣cond Part, so that you would really be at a loss, if you have spent all your Satyri∣cal Phrases on the first, and prodigally thrown away the last Jear your Mistress sent you on an odd expression she found
<PB N="44" REF="29"/>you had preferr'd from the Academy of Complements to your Heroick Love Epi∣stle; and for a further advancement made it the ridicul'd Interpreter of your Incomprehensible thoughts; your Lovely <HI>Caelia, Aminta,</HI> or what other fine Ro∣mantick Names you have bestow'd on the sweet Lady. I protest, Sir, if so, you must change your Company, and there wait a fit occasion to put it off a second time: Or else continue saying every now and then, with a bonne Grace, But Damn me, Madam, if it ben't very silly. This will do; for without doubt, Sir, the La∣dies will credit you; and the unknown Au∣thor hath but lost his labour, in think∣ing to forestall you, and be satyrical first; he'll bemoan the loss of so much pains; and ten to one the next Novel he writes, you will read in the Preface that he hath either hang'd or drown'd himself to put the thoughts of it out of his mind.</P>

<P>THE Corregidor daily visited <HI>Ricardo Antonio,</HI> who though his Wounds were by the di∣ligence of Skilful Surgeons almost heal'd, yet none understanding his
<PB N="46" REF="30"/>continued Distemper, nor the means to heal his Heart, he was of a brisk Gallant Man, become extreamly the Contrary; full of thought, and often discoursing and muttering to him∣self, that the Corregidor extreamly fear'd Madness might be the Conse∣quence of his restless Mind; and therefore by all means endeavour'd to recreate him; but this augmented his uneasiness, by adding to his grief such things as he shunn'd; therefore being wholly Cur'd of his Wounds, he resolv'd by travel, thinking <HI>Li∣sarda</HI> lost, to get rid of his Cordial, though troublesome Friends; and to this purpose, he, with all privacy, got things in a readiness, and in the dusk∣ish of the Evening rid out of Town, and in short time arriv'd at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and finding an opportunity to Em∣barque, aboard the Gallies of the Great Duke of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> who were up∣on their return; before he Embark'd, by Letters he acquainted his Friends of his health, and taking Bills of Ex∣change
<PB N="47" REF="30"/>for <HI>Rome,</HI> he set forward.</P>
<P>He acquainted the Captain of the Gally who he was, who treated him with all the Respect due to a Person of his Merit, and order'd his Lodg∣ing in the great Cabbin; where he endeavour'd to divert himself with the Lecture of some Books he had bought to that purpose at <HI>Barcelona;</HI> there was also lodg'd another Gentle∣man near <HI>Ricardo,</HI> whose Pensiveness and Melancholy, occasion'd <HI>Ricardo</HI> to take notice of him, and made him desirous to know the cause of his Sad∣ness; sometimes he was seen to lift up his Eyes to Heaven, at other times was heard to sigh and Curse his ad∣verse Fortune. One night after the many that <HI>Ricardo</HI> had heard this Gentleman sigh and groan, when others were bless'd with repose, and only they two lay a-wake, (for with the grieved there is no pleasing slum∣bers, nor rest, but such as Nature by force extorts from their Melancholy hours) <HI>Ricardo</HI> said to him, <HI>Truly
<PB N="48" REF="31"/>Sir, though you are a stranger to me, the trouble I perceive you lie under has ex∣treamly disturb'd me; for 'tis not a small Portion of Pity that should be bestow'd on so worthy a Gentleman under Affliction, which truly if I could any way remedy, I would willingly adventure my Life to ob∣tain your quiet; and in travelling many times are knit the strictest bonds of Friendship: Pardon me, (my own Con∣dition somewhat resembling yours, in that I also am under very uneasy Circumstan∣ces) if I desire that we may for the time to come, be pair'd in the happy number of Friends; and therefore hoping your bounty will not refuse my desire, I am willing to relate to you my Misfortunes, which I believe, if they are not greater, they may equal yours; hoping also that you'll pay me in the same Coin.</HI></P>
<P>Extreamly pleased was the Melan∣choly Gentleman, with the courte∣ous offers of <HI>Ricardo,</HI> who desir'd not to wonder that he of himself should relate a misfortune, that ought to be for his honour kept private from all
<PB N="49" REF="31"/>the World, but his Civilities had such influence over him, that he had not Power to refuse him any thing; besides he thought the stillness of the night requir'd a Companion to Dis∣course with to pass away those tedi∣ous hours; so that <HI>Ricardo</HI> began, and related the whole story of his Misfor∣tunes; and having ended, the Gen∣tleman confest his Misfortunes were great, but those he should relate were far exceeding his, in as much as he had not only lost a Mistress that he lov'd, but a Wife, whom he admir'd above all Worldly things; and his Honour, a thing that ought to be dearer than Life: And it was thus.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The History of Don</HI> Enrique Thomas.</HEAD>
<P>MY Name is <HI>Enrique Thomas de Guanches Fernandez Ysugo,</HI> my Country <HI>Barcelona,</HI> the Metropolitan of the noble Principality of <HI>Cattalonna,</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="32"/>my Quality of the Most Illustrious in that State; my Estate, though not of the largest, yet enough; and my Age thirty four Years: There dwelt in the very next House to my Fathers, a young Lady, whom I lov'd as I grew in sense and years, beginning from my Childhood: I mistake, I should say ador'd; for 'tis more than love, not to be said to live out of her sight. Our Parents were intimate Friends, and so our Acquaintance and Intima∣cy was the less noted by the Neigh∣bours, or scandaliz'd by the Envious. I will not tire you with the account of my Endeavours to please and gain that amiable Creature, that would be to tire you, as also refresh my Mind, and make me suffer a second Martyrdom; but in short, I'll say no Art, no Industry, no Zeal, can ever second mine to <HI>Donna Estefania,</HI> for so is she nam'd, who by her In∣gratitude hath caus'd my Misery; It will be enough to say we were both Children, our Loves great, her Beauty
<PB N="51" REF="32"/>vast, and her behaviour at that time exceeding Modest, very Witty, and consequently well discours'd; our op∣portunity did not a little encrease our Flames, for with the leave of our Parents, we at any time might see each other; and indeed seldom was it we were a sunder; by which our Parents perceiving our desires, con∣firm'd their Friendship by affinity, Marrying us both very young; who yet for all that, in our desires had been long wedded. Whoever say that Marriage gluts, and consequently impairs Love, certainly must be such dull Souls, who more like Brutes than Men, are but satisfying their sensual Appetite, while I'm sure all refin'd Spirits, who by the continual Enjoy∣ment, have daily the Experiments of the Wit, the Modesty, the Love, the pleasing Behaviour, affording daily fresh supplies to edge his Appetite, though her Beauty should diminish, and though I cannot pretend to more than just a reasonable Man, yet like
<PB N="52" REF="33"/>another <HI>Columbus,</HI> after many years of Enjoyment (when I thought it was impossible to love more, I found new Worlds, and daily fresh Delights, unknown to me the day before; ten Years did compleat my Joys with her, for as Heaven envy'd my Happiness, and malicious Hell resolv'd to obstruct it, after these years where Joys and Blessings crowded to me, by the vast∣ness, (I had been happier, had my love been less.) Our Estates joining together was so great, that her desire could not reach my Liberality, the Ostentation being conformable to our Riches, that we never so much ap∣pear'd Lover and Mistress, as when we were Man and Wife, but who would think it, Don <HI>Ricardo,</HI> that with all these visible signs of Love, (I am asham'd to say it) that <HI>Estefa∣nia</HI> should offend my Honour, that she should defile my Bed, rejoicing in a Strangers Arms; at least in de∣sire if not in deed; and who would think, that I being whom I am, should
<PB N="53" REF="33"/>live to own it, and that grief for the loss of my Honour should not deprive me of Life: I will not, my Dear Friend, nor will my Honour permit me to speak ill of that Sex, since we owe our Births to them, with the dangers of their own lives; but lay∣ing these natural Obligations aside, and to speak how firm they ought to be, and how constant: tell me what trust can a Man put in that Sex, or who can sleep secure of their Trea∣sons, since <HI>Estefania</HI> could be false? But to tell the story of my Misfor∣tune, Heaven having given me a Son, no less Beautiful than Witty, and ha∣ving seen him brought up with all the Accomplishments his Age was ca∣pable of; and since I could not leave him a larger Estate, I was desirous to better it by a Title to some Habit; and advis'd with my Wife, who said so much, and seem'd so eagerly to regret my absence for the time re∣quir'd to procure it at Court, that I even repented my self of the thought;
<PB N="54" REF="34"/>but considering it did import us, and above all, that I earnestly desir'd it, with much ado she gave me leave for fifteen days; for as she knew not the Court, she thought that enough to gain my pretensions: In short, I left <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and in a short space arriv'd at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and order'd my affairs so happily, that Fortune seem'd desirous to return me into <HI>Estefania</HI>'s Arms; for the King understanding the desert and services of my Fathers to the Crown, shortened the dispatch: Every Letter I receiv'd from <HI>Estefa∣nia,</HI> was fill'd with Complaints of my absence, and Prayers for my quick return; and I with the same desires, leaving my dispatches to the care of a Servant, made all possible haste to reach <HI>Barcelona</HI> within the limits of the time given me; and taking Post, such was my diligence, that had not a Tempest of Rain, Thunder, and Lightning hinder'd, I had enter'd <HI>Barcelona</HI> on the third day after my setting out of <HI>Madrid;</HI> but this sud∣den
<PB N="55" REF="34"/>change of the Weather, from a fine clear Day to a very stormy Even∣ing, oblig'd me to put into an Inne but two Leagues distant from my abode; where while I was resting my self, and ordering something for Supper, there came in a Gentleman, who by his Mein and Garb, I guest to be of Quality; but he was so wet, that I was oblig'd, although I did not know him, to offer him my Servants to un∣dress him and help to dry his Cloaths; and told him, if he pleas'd to accom∣pany me at my Table, I should esteem the Favour, and that he might also lodge with me: <HI>Don Federico</HI> thankt me (for so was his Name;) and af∣ter Supper, we pass'd an hour or two in relating Stories and several other Matters: In which discourse he shew'd much Judgment, speaking excellent Sense, and withal very chearful and witty. It being time now to betake our selves to our Lodging, we went into our Chamber, where while my Servant was undressing me, he said;
<PB N="56" REF="35"/>Sir, you expected a pleasanter Nights Lodging than what you'll find here, the Storm having depriv'd you of my Ladies Company: <HI>Federico</HI> answer'd also, vex'd at his ill luck, That Misfor∣tune reaches both of us, for I also thought to have had the Embraces of an Angelical Creature; that tho' it may be vain-glorious for me to say it, loves me, and is indeed in my mind the finest Woman in <HI>Barcelona;</HI> when, instead of that, I found my self in a Storm that drove me into this House, where were it not for <HI>Don Enrique</HI>'s Courtesie in admitting me into his Company, had far'd much worse.</P>
<P>The Night is such, said I, (not dreaming of my Misfortune) that it would have been a Misfortune to the Lady, had you got thither; for I fear you are not in the best Condi∣tion to Content her. If it were not her Beauty, said the inadvertiz'd Gen∣tleman, her Name is — unfortunate: The Servants took no notice of our
<PB N="57" REF="35"/>Discourse, and so unwilling to dive further into the Matter before them, I staid till we were in Bed, and they had lock'd the Doors and were gone; but no sooner did I see our selves a∣lone, but with as impertinent a Cu∣riosity, as malicious, and designedly to know the Lady's Name, I told him, I thought no Name in <HI>Spain</HI> un∣fortunate, because they are Names of Saints that are always given in <HI>Spain.</HI> To this he answer'd, That ever since in <HI>Castile</HI> there was a Lady named <HI>Estefania,</HI> who was kill'd by her Hus∣band, without ever offending him, only by the deceit of a Servant, That it was a vulgar Attribute of the <HI>Este∣fania's</HI> to be unfortunate. According to this your Lady is called <HI>Estefania</HI> said I, a little altered: And he an∣swer'd, Having told you the Story first, it would be a folly to think to hide her Name now: So craving leave to sleep, he turn'd himself, and left me not altogether free from a vil∣lainous suspicion of being Horn'd:
<PB REF="36"/>But however, when I represented to my self all the Letters of <HI>Estefania</HI>'s Desire of my Return, her continual Love to me, her modest Behaviour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I thought it a madness to think her false, whom I suppos'd as pure as Vestal Virgins, except in the Obliga∣tion of Matrimony, and so perswaded my self in the City there might be others of the Name. It was hardly Day when I gave <HI>Federico</HI> the Good∣morrow, asking him if he would rise to go into the City, that we might be there before Noon; and because he told me, that his Affairs requir'd him to stay till Night, and so I might go alone, and that afterwards he would enquire for me: But to tell you the Truth, my Desire was to be satisfied in my Mind, and to know who this <HI>Estefania</HI> was that he Gal∣lanted; so that I told him, that I would stay also and go along with him. He attributed this to Cour∣tesie and Affection, which indeed was Doubt and Jealousie. We re∣turned
<PB N="59" REF="36"/>to the same Discourse that we had before, and I offer'd my Service to him, if there were any Danger in the Atchievement of his Love. He thankt me, and told me there was no Danger, for though I have several Nights been within the House, yet I have not seen the Street, nor out∣ward Walls, nor could I find the House, though I endeavour'd it, such has been the Care and Secrecy of the Owner. 'Tis very strange said I, for you seem to contradict your self; How could you so often be in a House without seeing the Street? Well, that I may not seem a Cheat to you, I'll tell you, said he, and let you see the cunning Contrivances of the <HI>Sex</HI> when they would carry on an <HI>Intrigue.</HI> I was one Afternoon in the great Street buying a piece of Silk, and there came a Lady Veil'd to buy some Ribboning, and though now well cover'd with her Veil, yet at her first entrance into the Shop, she was not so much cover'd, but I saw a
<PB N="60" REF="37"/>a Glimpse of the most charming Creature I ever beheld: I came to her with the Courtesie men of my Quality should, desiring her to take what she had a mind to, without any other Interest, than to accept on't; She turn'd to her Servant, as 'twas, laughing at my Proffer, or wondring at my Liberality, being unusual: I discours'd with her awhile, and at last she came to tell me, that my Person pleas'd her, and that not through lightness, but a certain se∣cret Inclination oblig'd her to love me, from the very time she first saw me; for as Fowls have no Sex, so I think it not strange for a Woman to love at first any more than a Man; but she oblig'd me not to follow her, telling me, she was a Woman of more Obligations than I could ima∣gine; but that if I desir'd to see her again, she would expect me in a Walk call'd <HI>La Marina,</HI> naming me the Day and Hour I should meet her. I really thought this, added he, but
<PB N="61" REF="37"/>a Trick to get rid of me, till the Day and Hour that I was appointed, I saw her coming thither in a Coach, and stepping forth, that we might be more free and solitary, we took a Boat and went up the River; She acquainting me with her Love, tel∣ling me she wisht she were in a Con∣dition to dispose of her self, and I thanking her for those vast Favours, promis'd to love none other but her self: Thus did we several Days con∣tinue our Interviews, but one After∣noon that I found her in more than her ordinary loving Humour, I laid hold on the Opportunity, desirous to know her Quality. I pray'd her, since I was confident her Ingenuity could not be wanting to find a means of our seeing one another without gi∣ving her the trouble of coming out of her House; at first she made some Difficulty, but Love, according to the <HI>Latin</HI> Phrase, <HI>Overcomes all things,</HI> made her at last agree to it, but on condition I should behave my self
<PB REF="38"/>with great Care of her Reputation, with all Secrecy, and not be Inqui∣sitive farther than she would let me know her Pleasure. These Articles, with several others to the same pur∣pose, agreed on between us, we part∣ed, but not for long, for the next Day I was to go to her House in the man∣ner she should propose. Accordingly the next Day at the <HI>Marina</HI> Walk I expected her Orders. I had not been there long, before I saw two men bringing a Chair, in green Liveries, who bad me enter, and then closing all things well about me that I could not see, they had no sooner seated me and open'd the Chair, but I found my self in a fine large Room very well furnisht, hung with Arras, the Andirons Plate, Escritores and Cabi∣nets of curious worked Olive, inlaid with Ivory and Ebbony, and very fine Pictures: I had but just turn'd round to see this Room, when the beauteous Lady came to me, into whose House I often entred thus, be∣ing
<PB N="63" REF="38"/>still carried out in the same man∣ner; once my Curiosity, contrary to my Promise urged me, seeing one of the Chair-men in the Street that us'd to carry me, to ask whose Livery that was? and they told me, that it belong'd to <HI>Donna Estefania de Ar∣costy fuentes,</HI> by which I have sup∣pos'd that to be the Name of the charming Creature I love.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Federico</HI> put an end to his Story, and I remain'd confirm'd in the Opinion of my Disgrace, and yet I had some Place to doubt it, because all he had said was Ambiguous, and might serve for some other unfortu∣nate; but such delight he took in the relation of it, that he told so many Circumstances and signs of the House, as of the Beds, Cabinets, Hangings, and particularizing some Pieces of rare Paintings, of which I have ma∣ny, (being a great Admirer of them) of the Hands of all the most famous Artists, by which I was assur'd my House was the abus'd; and therefore
<PB N="64" REF="39"/>dissembling the Matter as much as I could, because about Four in the Af∣ternoon we mounted our Horses, and began our Journey towards the Town, he still telling what Pleasures he hop'd, and as it were each Word stabbed me to the Heart, for so doth every Injury done to my Honour reach the tenderest part about me; but I when I saw my self on the Road, was not so careful of any thing as to watch a convenient time, if not to Cure, at least to Revenge my Ho∣nour by his Death: Therefore I or∣der'd my Servants to make haste be∣fore us to tell my infamous Wife of my coming: At the crossing of a very thick Wood, where for many Years the Branches of the Trees hid the Roots from the heat of the Sun, I drew my Sword and gave him so strong a thrust through the Breast, that without speaking he fell on the Ground, where lighting from my Horse I gave him many Blows, that in a short time I put him past offend∣ing
<PB N="65" REF="39"/>me, or defending himself; he begg'd me not to kill him, but to give him time to confess, not knowing me, nor for why I used him so cru∣elly: I then thinking it would be too much Rigour, not to spare him so much time, since in it though his Bo∣dy was beyond the Art of Chirurge∣ry to heal, his Soul might be cured; I left him alive; for one thing it is to revenge my Honour as a Gentleman, and another thing to be a Christian; as I was offended, and in so nice a point, I thought I ought to have ended him; but as a Catholick I held back my Arm, that he might save his Soul; for to hinder a dying man of Confession, is to out-brave Impiety it self, and follow the Offender into Hell with my Revenge, and without doubt it hardens the Heart of God against such a one, when he shall de∣mand Mercy: therefore hearing Hor∣ses at a distance, that I might not be discover'd, I mounted and rode away, and as I rid I consider'd what
<PB N="66" REF="40"/>was to be done hence-forward, and considering with my self that to kill my Wife, would be to publish the Infamy as done, which was but just conceiv'd in Thought, and by that our Family would lose its ancient Lustre, I thought it a better Revenge to deprive her of my sight for ever; and with this Resolution in a short time I overtook my Servants, to whom I said, that on a Discourse of nothing we had had some few words, and that his Opiniatism had afronted me by his using some uncivil Lan∣guage, on which we fought, and in which Fight I had kill'd him, so that I would not have it known in <HI>Barce∣lona</HI> that I had left <HI>Madrid,</HI> but in disguise enter the Town, and so Em∣bark for <HI>Italy,</HI> or some foreign Coun∣try; and hearing of these Gallies, I addrest my self to the Captain of this Gally, who hath been very civil to me; but amidst all the Civilities he hath shewn, there is none I esteem more than having plac'd you so near me:
<PB N="67" REF="40"/>But now see, continu'd he, if any Mis∣fortune can be greater than mine, that loving (for I must own still I adore her) my Wife, I am forc'd never to see her more; while every one thinks perhaps, there being so many High-way-men here abouts, that I am faln into some such hands, and murder'd: Ah! I would to God it were so, or that it had been a com∣mon Soul to have born this Affront, that had not the loss of his Honour so imprinted in his Soul; that yet sometimes a Thought of Revenge will break through the Walls of Love, and makes me sometimes wish I had serv'd my Wife, as I did <HI>Fe∣derico.</HI></P>
<P>With Reason did <HI>Ricardo</HI> admire the strange Story <HI>Enrique</HI> told, which began their Acquaintance, and con∣tinued, so that being Arriv'd at <HI>Na∣ples</HI> they resolv'd not to part, but to Travel together: And having seen all the Curiosities of that stately Ci∣ty, they past by <HI>Civita Vecchia</HI> to
<PB REF="41"/><HI>Rome,</HI> where <HI>Ricardo</HI> took Money for his Journey upon his Bills of Ex∣change, and when they had kiss'd the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Feet, and seen those innu∣merable things worthy of Remark in this famous City, they departed, with intention to go to <HI>Loretta,</HI> and visit that House, where so many thousands daily come out of Devo∣tion; but as they were going into the Church, he was stopt by a Man on his Knees, who cry'd out, <HI>For∣give me, Sir, what-ever I have offended you in; I am heartily sorry, and must own 'tis only in your vast Generosity and known Goodness I trust.</HI> This startled <HI>Ricardo,</HI> but Reflecting, he remem∣bred <HI>Don Fulgentio Antonio</HI>'s Voice, and bidding him Rise, he told him he'd freely forgive him, and so walk∣ing into the Church, where after they had done their Devotions, and satis∣fied their Curiosity, they Retir'd to their Lodgings, and while Dinner was getting ready, <HI>Ricardo</HI> desir'd <HI>Fulgentio</HI> to Relate to him the Occa∣sion
<PB N="69" REF="41"/>of his Travels, and as far as might be known, the cause of his visit∣ing this Place of Devotion; which he consented to do, on his Promise that all past Actions should be forgot; and thus began:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="history">
<HEAD><HI>The History of</HI> Don Ful∣gentio Antonio.</HEAD>
<P>MY Pretensions to <HI>Donna Clara Lisarda</HI> you are sufficiently ac∣quainted with; how earnestly I lov'd, it is hardly possible in my Opinion to Comprehend; this hath been the Cause of all my Misfortunes which happen'd, as follows:</P>
<P>After my mistake was discover'd when I met you on the Road, such a Raging Madness possest my Soul, that had it not been Envy and a de∣sire of Revenge, I had certainly en∣ded my Life by laying violent hands on my self, where there lay no fault; for your too great Generosity as it
<PB REF="42"/>made me appear a Villain, so my Villainy made it appear the more re∣splendent amidst all my rash Acti∣ons, by which any other man, less good than your self, so often as For∣tune favour'd you with the Oppor∣tunity, would have made use of your Victory; (so far was you from deser∣ving any blame) that you never so much as offer'd to satisfie a Revenge that might have grown in any o∣ther Breast.</P>
<P>After I found that instead of <HI>Lisarda</HI> I had married <HI>Clara,</HI> finding by what you said, and <HI>Clara,</HI> that you went in search of <HI>Lisarda,</HI> I presently drove to a Village of mine, where with the Offers of a Reward I got eight of my Servants to wait your Return, giving <HI>Clara</HI> a thousand sweet words lest she might obstruct my Design. I left her in the Village while we, well Mounted and Arm'd, waited your Return on the Road, where you know how we rid away with the Coach: I hoping by this to confirm her in the
<PB REF="42"/>Belief of your Infidelity; and if not to get my own Ends at least, to dis∣pose her never to make you happy While we were on the way I used my Rhetorick, with all the Vows and Protestations imaginable, after my endeavours of disswading her from you; then I told her that now 'twas in my power whither I'd car∣ry her, and how I'd dispose of her; and therefore she had better comply than venture the Displeasure of a cho∣lerick Man: But all this produc'd nothing but Scorn and Slights from her, telling me no Man should ever have her, except <HI>Ricardo,</HI> who, how∣ever the Misfortune happen'd that Night, she was sensible he lov'd her, and was one deserving her love. I told her you were kill'd in the Skir∣mish. With that a Flood of Tears drop'd from her Eyes; O ye Powers said she! Then is <HI>Ricardo</HI> dead, and dar'st thou Villain, who hath been the cause, appear before me? go, know I loath Thee, and that now I'll die a
<PB N="72" REF="43"/>Maid, and ever bemoan the loss of that brave Man. But then is he dead, said she, and the Cause so near me yet lives! Snatching my Dagger from my side, gave me a Wound in my Breast, that had certainly kill'd me had her Arm had but a little more strength: At last, when I saw no∣thing could prevail, and that in her Company I endanger'd my Life, I be∣thought my self of carrying her to a Country-House I had, where I would keep her some time, to see if I possi∣bly could gain her by all the Endea∣vours that Love and Kindness could invent; which I did, and resolving not to stay with her, but to absent my self awhile, giving strict Orders to my Servants not to let her escape, but withal, to let her have all she could demand. I returned to <HI>Clara,</HI> who daily so endeavoured to make me love her; and considering I was married, and that I had best to make my Life as easie as I could: In two Months time seeing no hope of pre∣vailing
<PB N="73" REF="43"/>on <HI>Lasarda, Clara</HI> had so far gain'd me, that I really felt Motions of the greatest Tenderness for her; and as they say, <HI>Love begets Love,</HI> so was it with me; I left plying <HI>Lisar∣da</HI> with Letters, and began to forget her, and to have my Thoughts wholly taken up by <HI>Clara:</HI> So that at last I took Coach and went to vi∣sit <HI>Lisarda;</HI> and having heard that after you was heal'd, you went to Travel, told her what I knew, which so Rejoyc'd her, that she easily par∣don'd me for all things past, and so ordering a Coach, I had her convey'd to Town, where she remains in her Fathers House. With what Pleasure <HI>Ricardo</HI> heard all this, is not to be express'd, but it was plainly seen by his change of Countenance, for now he had recover'd a certain Gaiety and Briskness common to him before his Misfortune: But Dinner coming up stop'd the Procedure of <HI>Fulgentio</HI>'s re∣lation. <HI>Don Enrique</HI> all the while at Dinner perceiv'd such Alacrity in
<PB N="74" REF="44"/><HI>Don Ricardo</HI>'s Looks, and observing the many Questions he ask'd <HI>Don Fulgentio</HI> of <HI>Lisarda</HI>'s Health, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that he easily perceiv'd the Pleasure he took in hearing of her, and so began her Health, for which <HI>Don Ricardo</HI> thank'd him; but no sooner was Din∣ner ended, but <HI>Fulgentio</HI> was desir'd to continue his Relation; which was thus:</P>
<P>After I had got <HI>Lisarda</HI>'s Pardon, and heard she was safe at her Fa∣thers, my Love encreas'd so much towards <HI>Clara,</HI> that I don't know whether I could have thought my self happier with any one. She sent to her Relations, who were over-joy'd at her good Fortune, in getting a Husband after her miscarriage, and one of my Quality; they made her an indifferent Portion: But as I lov'd her, so did I grow jealous of her, re∣membring she had been faulty, and having one Night stay'd out, the next Morning a Servant told me he had seen a Man enter into my House, that
<PB N="75" REF="44"/>was but just gone before my coming, who with all their Privacy in bring∣ing him in and out, could not escape his Eyes: I without any further as∣surance, thought it must be <HI>Clara</HI> that was faulty, and there-withal go∣ing to her, though she lay asleep, wak'd her with a thousand Reproa∣ches, upbraiding her with her former Life; and maugre all the Assurances and Protestations she made, to such a height my Choler grew, that I struck her, she all the while with Tears and pitying avouching her In∣nocency, desiring me to make fur∣ther enquiry ere I proceeded so rash∣ly to accuse her; but I was deaf to all she said, and insensible with Rage, still continuing my ill usage: At last putting on her Night Gown, she came near a Table where a Pen-knife lay, and taking it up, gave her self several Stabs, and then said; <HI>Sir, I own I never was worthy of you, I own my Faults with which you upbraid me, but these being the last words which I shall
<PB N="76" REF="45"/>speak, be satisfied I am innocent as to what you now accuse me.</HI> Just as she was repeating these words, in came the Maid that waited on her in her Chamber, and seeing the Tragedy of her Mistress, and having heard at the Door part of our Discourse, she cry'd, <HI>O, Sir! what have you done? 'Twas I brought in the Man last Night, who is my Husband, though my Marriage was unknown till now.</HI> Hearing this, I had no Patience; I sent for Surgeons, and in the mean time we endeavour'd to tye up her Wounds: A thousand times I ask'd her Pardon; to which she answer'd, <HI>Alas! Sir, I forgive you, but 'tis too late for Remedy, I find my fleeting Soul departing from my Body; but with much ease I die, since you are sa∣tisfied, and love me still;</HI> Then drawing me by my and, she brought my lips to hers, and immediately dy'd. This is the Misfortune hath brought me hi∣ther, to make Atonement for all my Sins, of which I hope God will ac∣cept.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="45"/>
<P>No sooner had he ended this Re∣lation, but <HI>Ricardo</HI> begg'd of <HI>Enrique</HI> to accompany him to <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> where he might be safe in his House from the search the Law made after him, which he consented to; so lea∣ving the penitent <HI>Fulgentio</HI> to finish his Romery, they in all haste Rid towards <HI>Florence,</HI> and Arriving at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> opportunely found a Ship bound for <HI>Barcelona;</HI> they went Aboard, and having a fair Wind, in little time Arriv'd at their wish'd for Haven; but <HI>Enrique</HI> not willing to land at <HI>Barcelona</HI> for fear of being known, they were set ashore at <HI>Mon∣serrate,</HI> a place where crowds of all sorts of People flock to pay their De∣votions to an Image, by whom they suppose many Miracles wrought, called, <HI>Our Lady of Monserrate;</HI> but no sooner were they come into the Inne, and a little rested their selves, but leaning out of the Window, <HI>En∣rique</HI> saw a Litter stop at the Door of the Inne where they lodg'd, six
<PB REF="46"/>Servants attending it, and as the Master, a Gentleman very fine; but no sooner had he seen two Ladies step out of the Litter, but <HI>Ricardo</HI> observ'd he chang'd his Colour, and remain'd Confus'd, Melancholy and Thoughtful; and Reflecting on this, ask'd him, <HI>What was the matter?</HI> When he answer'd in a great Passi∣on; <HI>Sir, What shall I say? Or, what can sufficiently express my Misfortune; if I see come out of that Litter the infamous base</HI> Estefania, <HI>with my Enemy</HI> Don Federico. <HI>Ricardo</HI> pray'd him to con∣sider and be advis'd, to do nothing rashly: These things, saith he, ought to be governed with Prudence, o∣therwise consider what Scandal your Passion may bring upon your Fa∣mily. Therefore saith he, Let me ad∣vertize you to be quiet, and not to disturb your self; be satisfied you have a Friend by your side, who to satis∣fie the least Scruple of your Honour, would lose many Lives. With this he came a little to himself. The place
<PB N="79" REF="46"/>being but small, and the People ma∣ny that flock thither, they could not get Accommodations in the House. <HI>Ricardo</HI> locking <HI>Enrique</HI> in a Room, desir'd he might have the manage∣ment of this Affair, lest he in his Pas∣sion might do what with Reason he might Repent hereafter; and then going down to the Litter, he desired they would be pleased to accept of his Quarters, till the Servants might find some more Commodious; which Offer they kindly accepted of, and <HI>Don Ricardo</HI> brought them into a Dining-Room that joyned to that <HI>Enrique</HI> was lockt in; of which <HI>En∣rique</HI> was presently advertized: so that hearkning at the Key-hole, he heard the following Discourse. <HI>Ri∣cardo</HI> after some Complements past, crav'd the Honour that they would let that Chance be the beginning of an Acquaintance and Friendship be∣tween them, which he should highly value: They answered him, The greatest Pleasure and Satisfaction
<PB N="80" REF="47"/>would be theirs; and then enquired where he was going, and from whence he came. To the first he answer'd, <HI>He was going to</HI> Andaluzia: And to the second, <HI>That he came from</HI> Italy, <HI>and that only for the sake of two Years Travelling, and Diverting himself.</HI> Hardly had <HI>Donna Estefania</HI> heard him name <HI>Italy,</HI> but turning to her Sister, and <HI>Federico,</HI> said, <HI>To the best of my remembrance, 'tis there-abouts, though each Day hath seem'd an Eter∣nity, that my dear</HI> Don Enrique <HI>hath been wanting, and according to what I have heard travell'd that same way. So many are the</HI> Spaniards <HI>in that Country,</HI> reply'd Ricardo, <HI>and so many I have been there acquainted with, that it is strange I have not met with him. His Name is</HI> Don Enrique, <HI>said</HI> Donna Estefania, <HI>with Tears trickling down her Cheeks. Ricardo</HI> having this Oc∣casion, told her, <HI>He knew him very well, and that he had been his Compa∣nion many Miles; and the Reason, as he told me, that he stay'd at</HI> Milain, <HI>was
<PB N="81" REF="47"/>a Business of Honour that Banisht him from his Country, and without hopes of Return. Donna Estefania</HI> hearing this, could not longer bear with her ex∣cessive Grief; so that giving a great Sigh, she would have spoke, but <HI>Fe∣derico</HI> desiring her to be Patient, cra∣ved her leave to tell the Story, as the best Witness of the Misfortune.</P>
<P>The Haps and Rencounter of this World are sometimes no less strange than difficult to Penetrate: and that you may give notice to her Friend <HI>Don Enrique,</HI> how much to his own and his Ladies Disquiet he is decei∣ved, as also of my Innocence, Sir, I must first acquaint you that <HI>Valla∣doled</HI> is the Place where I first breath'd, and having been affronted there in such a manner, that I was Obliged in defence of my Honour, having an Opportunity to write my Displea∣sure in his Face, and marking him for one of a forwarder Tongue than Courage, my Friends fearing the Consequence, his Quality and Inte∣rest
<PB N="82" REF="48"/>being Great, they sent me to <HI>Barcelona,</HI> to avoid those Troubles that might follow; where after Hun∣ting, one Evening, by a Storm I was forc'd to put into a House upon the Road, and discoursing of what is most common to young Men; Love I mean, (to a Gentleman, who by the Tokens I gave of him, we know to be <HI>Don Enrique;</HI>) I chanc'd to tell the Story of my Amours with a La∣dy, whose Name I did not know, nor could I describe any more than the inside of the House, her Care ha∣ving been such, that I was carried in and out in a Chair close on every side, when ever I was honoured to see her at her Dwelling. This Lady <HI>Donna Angela,</HI> the Sister of <HI>Donna E∣stefania</HI> is the Person whom <HI>Donna Estefania</HI> had invited to stay with her, during the Absence of her Hus∣band, and that directed by her Stars, and not my Deserts, loved me: But one Day seeing one of the Chair-men, I askt a Neighbour whose Livery
<PB N="83" REF="48"/>that was, and telling me it was <HI>Don∣na Estefania</HI>'s, I supposed that to be the Name of the Person that I loved, and naming her so to <HI>Don Enrique;</HI> this occasion'd all our Misfortune, for he as we were the next day Riding hither, drew, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Here <HI>Don Enrique</HI> not having any longer Patience, but over-joy'd to hear his Wife was innocent; as <HI>Ri∣cardo</HI> was a-going to surprize them by opening the Door, and giving <HI>Donna Estefania</HI> a sight of what she so much lov'd, burst it open with his Foot, and running to his Wife, Em∣brac'd her, begging Pardon for his Suspicion and Jealousie; then turn∣ing to <HI>Federico,</HI> begg'd his also: And thus was their Melancholy turn'd in∣to the greatest Ecstasie of Joy; then <HI>Donna Estefania</HI> told him that he must wish Joy to her Sister and <HI>Don Fe∣derico,</HI> who were Man and Wife; which he did, being very well plea∣sed with the Match: Then Supper was brought up, and having supp'd,
<PB N="84" REF="49"/><HI>Enrique</HI> enquired further of the Sto∣ry, and <HI>Federico</HI> told him, that he wounded him extreamly, but by the Assistance of some Shepherds he was brought to Town, but lay under the Surgeon's hands three Months; and the thing coming to be known who was the Author of that Deed, it was talkt about the Town as if <HI>Donna Estefania</HI> had dishonoured you, which made us make an end the sooner of our Courtship and marry; and then having the liberty to tell the Story, we cleared both you and your Lady, and the Town were satisfied. Ha∣ving ended their Discourse, <HI>Ricardo</HI> told <HI>Enrique,</HI> That though he lost the Satisfaction of having his Com∣pany on the Road, yet he hoped he might have the Honour of their com∣ing to his Nuptials; and though he could not expect them to go imme∣diately, yet, said he, It may be an agreeable Divertizement for them to go as far into the Country as his A∣bode, where though he could pro∣mise
<PB N="85" REF="49"/>them no great Entertainment, yet they should be heartily Welcome, and he thought the Company of that loving Pair would extreamly Grace his Marriage, which he hoped would be shortly Celebrated: Then <HI>Donna Angela</HI> desired to know if she might be acquainted with his Mistresses Name, which he told her was <HI>Lisar∣da;</HI> O then, Sir, saith she, you may safe∣ly depend on your Marriage, for by her Name I guess yours to be <HI>Don Ricardo Antonio,</HI> the only Person she hath told me should be her Husband; for about three Months ago I came acquainted with her here, she ha∣ving vowed the Romery for your Prosperity; we became so intimate∣ly acquainted lodging in the same Inne together, that she told me the whole Story of your Loves. After this <HI>Ricardo</HI> made a Complement to <HI>Federico</HI> of his Bed for himself and his Lady, and <HI>Enrique</HI> with his La∣dy betook themselves to his own; and <HI>Ricardo</HI> getting not quite so fit∣ting
<PB REF="50"/>a Lodging for a Lady, retired contentedly to it, and in the Morn∣ing early getting up, got his Horse in a readiness; when his Friends were just beginning to stir, he took leave of them, with their Promise to fol∣low him, and sets forward for <HI>An∣daluzia.</HI></P>
<P>Love hath Wings, and never did he accomplish a Journey in so short a time. It was about 11 at Night when he entred the Town, and perceiving some Gentlemen at the Door of <HI>Don∣na Clara Lisarda</HI>'s House, tuning their Instruments, by which he knew they had a mind to Divert some Lady; he at a distance alighted off his Horse, desirous, if it was possible, to know who these were, serenading, as he thought, his Mistress: Therefore by chance finding the next Door open, he entred as if it were his own house, and so putting himself behind the Door, unperceived by them, he heard their Song and Musick, which was no sooner ended, but he heard the
<PB N="87" REF="50"/>Lady shut her Window; the Com∣pany took leave of one another, and one who seemed to be the Master of this Treat, mounted a Horseback: <HI>Don Ricardo,</HI> though tired with a long Journey, and very desirous to see <HI>Don Pedro de Vargas</HI> the Corregidor, yet more desirous to see his supposed Rival, he mounted his Horse with intention to follow him; but of a sudden he saw himself surrounded with six men, who asked him, Whe∣ther he would part with his Money or his Life; <HI>Ricardo</HI> more anger'd at their hindring his Design, than their Audacity, gave no other Reply, but shot and killed one of them, the rest set upon him, but he defended him∣self so well, till his supposed Rival, not yet got so far off, but that he heard the Noise they made, was re∣turn'd, by which the Rogues forgot the thoughts of Booty, and endea∣voured to save their Lives by run∣ning: And <HI>Don Ricardo</HI> thus freed, turning to thank the Gentleman,
<PB REF="51"/>knew him for his Cousin <HI>Don Pedro</HI> the Corregidor. Great were their Joy, for seeing each other, throwing themselves about one anothers Neck, and embracing. They were no sooner got home, but they went to Bed, for at <HI>Don Pedro</HI>'s desire, he stay'd there, it being late; but <HI>Don Ricardo</HI> had his Thoughts so busily employ'd on <HI>Lisarda,</HI> that gave him leave but just to satisfie Nature with Sleep; awa∣king early in the Morning, he pre∣sently was for going to visit, or at least write to <HI>Lisarda;</HI> still enter∣taining himself with the Hopes of her Constancy; although now and then the Serenade he had heard, and at her House, would interrupt him in the most pleasing Thoughts; and his hearing the Window shut, made him conceive that the Serenaded Per∣son was not displeased with the Com∣plement; but then again, other Rea∣sons and other Thoughts disswaded him from his Jealousie. <HI>Don Pedro</HI>'s desire to enjoy his Cousins Compa∣ny
<PB N="89" REF="51"/>awhile, made him early to give him a Visit; but coming to his Cham∣ber, and finding him already drest, he said, giving him the Good-mor∣row, you are as early Drest, as if you Divin'd the Happiness you shall have to Day, of enjoying the Com∣pany of your Mistress, who without doubt, to your great Joy, I'll tell you, loves with an unparallell'd Con∣stancy; but withal I must tell you, you are not the only happy Man, for I also, who by visiting <HI>Lisarda,</HI> to excuse first the Mistake, and next to Perswade her to a Liking of you, her Cousin <HI>Donna Maria</HI> several times hapning to be there, Glanced such Flames from her Eyes, that she fir'd my Soul, and I am become her Adorer; who I had just serenaded as I met with you. <HI>Don Ricardo</HI> askt then where she dwelt; who told him, That since their House was burnt, they laid in the same House with <HI>Donna Lisarda;</HI> but be∣cause it is something early, I will
<PB N="90" REF="52"/>tell you an Adventure which will entertain us till it may be time for us to Visit the Ladies.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The History of the Loves of</HI> Don Roderigo <HI>and</HI> Don Pedro, <HI>to</HI> Donna Ma∣ria.</HEAD>
<P>AFter your Departure, dear Cou∣sin, which being so privately, we were extreamly troubled, lest your melancholy Thoughts might have made you Injure your self, and not knowing what was become of you, the whole Town was so Con∣cern'd, they cry'd out for Revenge on the Villains who we supposed had misus'd you, and killed those that were brought home with you; but finding no Evidence against them, but their own Confessions, was, That they at the Noise coming
<PB N="91" REF="52"/>out of their Houses found the Mur∣derers gone, and you all on the Ground, who they suppos'd Dead; that they would have taken your Cloaths and Money, and to that end carried you to their House; be∣sides receiving a Letter from <HI>Don Fulgentio,</HI> brought by the fair <HI>Lisar∣da,</HI> that discharged them of the Mur∣der. I was going to pass Sentence on them for a years Imprisonment, when <HI>Donna Maria,</HI> whose Vassals they were, begged, or rather com∣manded their Freedom. 'Twas first here I began to Admire; but after∣wards, as I have told you, Visiting <HI>Donna Lisarda,</HI> and seeing her there, I began to Adore those extraordinary Perfections and Accomplishments I found in her: Here began I to know the Happiness of Loving, and being Belov'd; for both her Parents and she liked me, my Quality and Estate being both very great: But, Sir, Crosses are things inseparable from Love, and I must also have my
<PB N="92" REF="53"/>share; I had <HI>Don Roderigo Vasques</HI> for my Rival, a Man whose Tongue stands him in much stead, since without ever drawing his Sword, no Duel, no gallant Actions are per∣formed, but he makes himself the Owner, and draws all the Reputa∣tion of them to himself, and that with such Cunning and Subtilty, that long time he had undeservingly the Name of a Heroe. My Courage sufficiently known in many famous Exploits for the Service of the King,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>All Governours of Towns in</HI> Spain <HI>carry a Wand in token of their Office.</HI></NOTE> and that hath gained me this Honoura∣ble Verge, was Eclips'd by this false Light; and <HI>Donna Maria,</HI> a Woman of an He∣roick Spirit, seemed at the same time the Match was making between us, to lend him her Ear readier than to any other; such was his Cun∣ning and his Art in deceiving and in∣venting new Deceits, that I was al∣most afraid he would Cheat me of my Mistress: But one Day, it hap∣pen'd
<PB N="93" REF="53"/>well for me, (since no further harm was done.) We were standing and discoursing some other Gentle∣man, when news was brought us <HI>Don∣na Maria</HI>'s house was in a Flame; we all ran to the Assistance of that Fa∣mily: But Gods! What Terrour was it for me to see <HI>Donna Maria</HI> in the Balcony, (the House being surround∣ed by the Fire,) begging Aid to help her from perishing; eagerly I ran through the Flame, and getting up Stairs, luckily found a Bar of Iron, with which I broke a Hole through the Wall; then snatching her up in my Arms, I carried her through that Hole, which the Fire had not yet reach'd, and gave her into her Fa∣ther's Arms. The Fright, the Noise, and Fear they were in, would not permit them to take notice of me; and I remembring her Woman was left behind, went to venture a se∣cond time, but met <HI>Roderigo</HI> bring∣ing her through the same Hole, who fearful of the Flames, had got a Lad∣der,
<PB N="94" REF="54"/>by which he got into the Balco∣ny to help off <HI>Donna Maria</HI>'s Wo∣man; and seeing that my help was no further needed, went away about my Occasions, not to be troublesome at such a busie time. But <HI>Don Roderi∣go</HI> carried the Woman where her La∣dy was, and just come to her self, for the Smoak and Fright put her into a Swoon, in which Condition I took her, carried her to her Father, and left her: She seeing him doing that good Office to her Woman, suppo∣sed it was him that had done the same for her; and truly with the Noise and Fright, her Friends took not so much Notice as to be able to do me Justice; so that in Recom∣pence of his saving her Life, (as she suppos'd) She with her Friends Vow'd to be his; He with a feigned Modesty, said, That he truly had done nothing for their Service, at least, it was so little, as did not de∣serve Thanks from her Mouth, much less so great a Blessing as Her self;
<PB N="95" REF="54"/>but it was too great a Good to be refused, and that he now trusted to her Word.</P>
<P>The next Day it was all about the Town that <HI>Don Roderigo</HI> had ventur'd through the Fire, and rescued <HI>Donna Maria:</HI> This was every bodies story which did not a little vex me. I af∣firm'd the Action to be mine, and that he ly'd who said the contrary. <HI>Don Roderigo</HI> said, Yes it was I did it; but that with such a false Smile, such a feigned Dissimulation, and with such Equivocating words, that he own'd the Action more in his Denial than I in all my Affirmatives; but what did comfort me, was, I had a Witness in my Pocket, that though it was Inanimate, with <HI>Donna Maria</HI> I was sure would confute my Rival. Sir, it was a Ring I took off her Fin∣ger as I carried her out of the Fire; and therefore to do my self Justice, I went to give her Father a Visit, who now were all in <HI>Donna Lisar∣da</HI>'s House; and desiring to see
<PB N="96" REF="55"/><HI>Donna Maria,</HI> and telling her the Truth, the Ring gave it Credit, with the Promise to me she had gi∣ven to <HI>Roderigo;</HI> the story now was turn'd, and it was made known throughout the Town, how falsly <HI>Don Roderigo</HI> claimed the Honour of that Action; so that through shame he was fain to leave the Town, and retire to a Seat he has in the Coun∣try where he still continues.</P>
<P>Having thus ended his Story, <HI>Don Ricardo</HI> being desirous to see his <HI>Lisarda,</HI> they went together, but the Joy <HI>Lisarda</HI> had at the sight of <HI>Ri∣cardo,</HI> cannot be exprest, no more than his at the sight of her. But to be short with you, and to make an end; both his Marriage with <HI>Lisar∣da,</HI> and his Cousins with <HI>Donna Ma∣ria</HI> were concluded, and to be Cele∣brated both the Sunday following; On the Day before the Marriage, <HI>Don Enrique</HI> and <HI>Don Federico,</HI> with their Ladies Arrived, so that they
<PB N="97" REF="55"/>had a full House, great Entertain∣ment, and a long continued Feast for Joy, and living very lovingly and happily all the Days of their Lives.</P>
