<HEAD>A RELATION of the Duke of <HI>Brunswickes</HI> and <HI>Mansfields</HI> proceedings against the enemies Forces in the <HI>Palatinate.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentle Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Ecause I see, that the generall <HI>Cur∣rantos</HI> coming weekely ouer, haue rather stifled their owne credites, then giuen satisfaction vnto the world; and that yet men throng as fast to heare Newes, as they beyond the Seas throng ouer, and huddle together all manner of things to please the people, both here and else-where; I could not chuse but take pitty of their longings and desires, that are truly affectionate to Religion, and the Cause of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and so expose vnto thee, whosoeuer thou art, this Relation of credite, which came to my hands the twelfth of Aprill, wherein you shall see a modest declaration of the affaires of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the tumultuous pro∣ceedings of such <HI>Princes,</HI> as either wish well to the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> or suppose themselues wronged by the Emperours imperiousnesse, and <HI>Bauariaes</HI> ambitious hastinesse to vsurpe anothers inheritance, and so I fall to the matter, as I finde it thus written.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<P>I will not trouble you, my selfe, nor contrarious humors; yea such poore Papisticall Newes-mon∣gers, that will haue <HI>Sluce</HI> lost, and <HI>Brunswicke</HI> slaine before euer they were in danger, with former repe∣titions of matters already published, nor once dis∣pute of the motiues, causes, effects, alterations, or any other circumstances of the warres, eyther in <HI>Bo∣hemia,</HI> or the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> but come roundly to the present businesse, and tell you what is now a doing, and what is likely to follow.</P>
<P>Euer since the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> beganne to repine at <HI>Bauariaes</HI> intrusion into the honour of these acti∣ons, and the Emperour seemed partially affected to his seruice, many Princes misliked the same, and by way of commiseration thought it too much, that the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> should be vtterly ouerthrowne; and therefore, as you haue participated out of diuers Discourses, they haue recollected themselues, and thus proceeded toward his reliefe and supportation: whereas it hath beene first generally reported, that <HI>Hungaria</HI> is reduced to the Emperours iurisdiction, and that a League of Amitie hath beene contracted betweene him, and <HI>Bethelem Gabor;</HI> there is no such matter, but rather the contrary. For the Prince of <HI>Transiluania</HI> calling the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> Gossip, by reason he had christned him a childe; hath protested neuer to forsake him, till he see him one way or an∣other re-established: Indeed I must confesse he hath abstained from crowning himselfe king of <HI>Hungarie,</HI> vpon a certaine vow, he would neuer be inuested, till the <HI>Spanish</HI> garrisons and Emperors forces were put out of Rub, <HI>Camora</HI> &amp; other places: yea till <HI>Preshurgh</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>it selfe were taken and cleered.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Marquesse of <HI>Ieggendorff</HI> keeping the fields and villages of <HI>Morauia</HI> for the vse of the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> cleane contrary to the feare and di∣stresse he hath bene put in by the Emperours forces, hath giuen him seuerall defeates, and approoued himselfe a faithfull friend and seruitor.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the repinings of <HI>Prague,</HI> and some other townes, which are still vnder the King of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> protection haue bene greater against the Emperour and his forces of late dayes, then euer before.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the Duke of <HI>Wittenberg,</HI> scarce named in other Relations, hauing mustered some forces for the defence of his Countrey, and commaunded by the Emperour to vnite them to <HI>Bauaria,</HI> hath an∣swered plainely, That as they are mustered by the aduice of his Counsell and Lords, they are likewise to be disposed by them, who neuer had occasion of vnkindnes with the <HI>Palatine,</HI> and therefore will not now beginne.</P>
<P>Fiftly, the Princes of the Vnion perceiuing what a fearefull thing it is to let an enemy set footing in an others Countrey, especially to fortifie himselfe, as the <HI>Spaniard</HI> hath done in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> are generall repiners at their owne first slackenesse, and so resolue to recouer their much distressed honours by some new and glorious attempts in behalfe of their friend and confederate.</P>
<P>Sixtly, the Marquesse of <HI>Boden,</HI> and <HI>Lantsgraue</HI> of <HI>Hesse,</HI> standing hitherto, as it were, at a stay, though they euer had good harts, wil now draw their friend together, and be seene in the field.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P>Seuenthly, the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> comming but first into the Low countries, to salute the Queene of <HI>Bohemia</HI> at the <HI>Hage,</HI> offered them his seruice, and was not onely accepted, but supplied with men and mo∣ney by the <HI>Sluces,</HI> and so went directly into <HI>Westpha∣lia,</HI> and by degrees like a ball of snow waxed bigger and bigger, &amp; increased his forces, so that he attemp∣ted the Dioces of <HI>Cullen,</HI> &amp; proceeded in many glo∣rioue actions which you haue heard of, and which haue indeed made him renowned ouer the world.</P>
<P>Last of all, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> though some vnkind∣nesse at the first passed between the Prince of <HI>Anhalt,</HI> and him, and all for the loue of the King of <HI>Bohemia:</HI> hath yet prospered so well, that he came round about the countries, &amp; performed such actions of admira∣tions, that there are few kingdomes of <HI>Europe,</HI> which haue not bin filled with the relations of his proceed∣ings, and euer memorable exploites, so that he hath reduced diuers Prouinces vnder his obedience, and now stands like a worke impregnable with a mighty army and most willing heart to set forward the king of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> designes.</P>
<P>These things are in the general thus set downe to shew you the cause, why the Emperor without con∣trouersie is weary of the warre, and suspects that his friends wil neuer be able to withstand so great forces &amp; men exasperated euery where against him, not so much for his owne cause, and great spirit in main∣taining his honour &amp; renowne, as hearkening to the <HI>Sirens</HI> songs of the Iesuites, who in trueth care ney∣ther for him, nor any Prince whatsoeuer, nor for the slaughter of the people, disturbance of their gouern∣ments,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>deuastation of their countries, and vtter sub∣uersion of their quietnes, but for their owne ends &amp; superintendency euen ouer the Pope himself: where∣upon he hath wisely foreseene greater mischiefes, &amp; so doth politikely goe about to preuent the same by sending an Ambassador into <HI>England</HI> for pacification (if it may be) of these troubles; but of this no more, til Time produce a fairer birth, &amp; make knowne the successe of that Embassie, with all other things de∣pending.</P>
<P>I will now go forward to the businesse in hand, which depends on the actions of the Duke of <HI>Bruns∣wicke,</HI> and Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who haue beene in pre∣sent imployment, euen since the Emperors Ambas∣sadour went into <HI>England,</HI> and most wonderfully set forward the King of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> affaires, so that as far as men may be confident of worldly computation, ther is great hope of recouery, &amp; turning of fortunes wheele, that he may be brought at last to the toppe, which hath so long beene kept with his head downe∣ward: so that to make the matter more perspicuous, I must say with the Poet; <HI>arma virosqne cuno,</HI> and tell you first, what the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> hath done, &amp; next, how Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath proceeded.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Brunswicke</HI> he hath long since bin in possession of <HI>Patter-horne, Westphalia,</HI> and the Bishop∣ricke of <HI>Cullen,</HI> wherein his progresses haue had won∣derfull successe, as by the preuailing in many skirmi∣shes may appeare, so that the Bishop of <HI>Cullen</HI> being the duke of <HI>Bauariaes</HI> brother, hath diuers times ad∣uertised the Emperor and the rest of his friends, what distresse he hath bene in, and is likely to endure, if he
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>be not better releeued, whereupon many by <HI>Bauari∣aes</HI> appoyntment haue come to his assistance, namely <HI>Monsieur Iilley, Gonzales;</HI> another Prince of <HI>Anhalt</HI> and the Gouernor of <HI>Gulick,</HI> all which haue sundry times skirmished with the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> and as you haue heard in as sundry Relations could ne∣uer boast of preuailing, no not of equality in their encounters, but departed stil with losse on their side, while these skirmishes had their seuerall passages; Newes came vnto him of the King of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> de∣parture from the <HI>Hage</HI> secretly in the company of sir <HI>Francis Nethersoll,</HI> and sir <HI>Charles Morgane,</HI> two English Knights, and eight other: some tolde him, that all his tents, armour and prouision of the warre were shipped at <HI>Enchysen</HI> to goe to <HI>Bream,</HI> or some other rendezuous nearer to himselfe, and the places he meant to goe vnto; some discoursed of diuerse men of warre which attended him, as though hee re∣solued for <HI>Denmarke,</HI> but others seemed to vnder∣stand the truth indeed, and assured him he was gone disguised from <HI>Calis</HI> to <HI>Sedan,</HI> to visite the old duke of <HI>Bolloigne,</HI> and there to acquaint Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> with his intent, and purposes, and receiue from him and sir <HI>Horatio Vere,</HI> a true Certificate of the estate of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and the army, and so either to ex∣spect a Conuoy to meete with Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> or march with the whole army into som other country.</P>
<P>When the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> heard of this, he forthwith bestirred himselfe, and set his actions on their best feete, that hee might be ready to attend the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> wheresoeuer hee went; and thus he preuailed in many seuerall encounters tooke
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>diuers prisoners, ransackt <HI>Patterborne,</HI> and <HI>Westphalia,</HI> marched as farre as <HI>Sipstate,</HI> sackt 8 or 9 townes, bat∣tered diuers castles and forts, and al ouer put the Pa∣pists in a generall feare, especially the Iesuites, whom of all others he hated, and of whom hee was some way reuenged: for they will haue him thus to pro∣ceed against them in two seuerall places.</P>
<P>First, while he was resident in <HI>Munsterland,</HI> and had according to the chaunce of warre, and custome of Souldiers, pillaged the Villages, and spoyled the Inhabitants, two seuerall Iesuites spared for no in∣uectiues against him, but railed in their Sermons, &amp; in euery Pulpit where they preached, mis-termed him worse then a tyrant, bloud-sucker, and traytor, thundering against him curses and damnation; yea cursing all his partakers and enterprises, whereupon the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> thus exasperated, proiected how to be reuenged, and yet would faine do it with∣out shedding of bloud; whereupon he sent a mes∣senger for them, whom they denied, and added <HI>Elias</HI> prayers for fire from heauen to consume the <HI>Captains</HI> of fifty: then he sent certaine troups to surprise them, who tooke them in a manner of an Ambuscado, and brought them before him; whereupon hee that was most faulty, kneeled downe, and importuned him to pardon his offence, and saue his life: at which <HI>Bruns∣wicke</HI> smiled &amp; answered; that his life would do him no good, but he would make some sport with him to cheere his hart: &amp; thus prouing inexorable, he com∣manded certaine officers to strip him naked, &amp; drop him all ouer with pitch and tarre, keeping him stil by a warm fire, that it might be moist vpon him, &amp; then

<PB N="8" REF="7"/>they rowled him among feathers, till he was all ouer like some strange foule, or monster of <HI>Affricke:</HI> then he had a halter put about his necke, and so was led round about the army: last of all, he was sent to the Nunnery, where the dainty Lasses had work enough to make him cleane, and picke off his feathers.</P>
<P>Another time after the surprising of a towne, in which were two Iesuites more wealthy, then all the religious Friers in the same; he sent certaine Offi∣cers vnto them, to inuite them to a Banquet, who though they were vnwilling to come, yet they durst not deny; and when they came, were so extraordina∣rily well vsed, that they beganne with iollity to com∣mend his entertainment, and thought themselues se∣cure, because of outward <HI>Curtesies:</HI> at last the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> drank to them, and told them, that he was certified they had much money lying by them, which they put to no good vses; therefore he would play the Banker for them, and put it out both more charitably and piously; and when they began to deny it, calling our Lady &amp; the Saints to witnes, that they were abused and slandred, he sware a great oathe, ad∣ding withall, as he wisht the K. of <HI>Bohemia</HI> to thriue: he would flea them naked, &amp; torture them with pin∣sors, if either they dallied with him, or tooke not a present course to satisfie him: whereupon seeing no remedy, they brought his Officers to their Cloisters, and shewed their treasure, which amounted vnto 100000. dollers, and this was the end of that busi∣nesse: but be not deceiued in this Relation about precedencie of time, as though this were newly done.</P>
<PB REF="7"/>
<P>For it was the beginning of March last, and might haue bin ranked with his other actions, but that I suppose it came not within the reaches of common fingers, or dayly Corantos, and so I proceed to his last businesse and encounters, which made way to a false reports of his death. You haue many times heard that <HI>Cordua</HI> out of <HI>Crusmacke,</HI> Generall of the army, which <HI>Spinola</HI> left in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and <HI>Mon∣sier Tilley</HI> from <HI>Bauaria,</HI> as he could be spared came to the assistance of the Bishop of <HI>Collen</HI> Prince Ele∣ctor, and receiued certaine ouerthrowes from <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> who sent his trophies of his spoyles to the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> as a rembrance of his seruice vnto her, whereupon euer since they haue watcht opportunity to be reuenged, and the Bishop hath mustered new forces, hauing supportation from the gouernours of <HI>Gulicke, Wessell</HI> with certaine <HI>Bur∣gonions</HI> and <HI>Wallons,</HI> who presently vnited themselues to his owne subiects and people, and so made another strong army which by the end of March was ready to march vnder the command of the yonger brother of the house of <HI>Anholt,</HI> and here sirnamed the Prince of <HI>Anholt:</HI> all these watched the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> and resolued by some encounter or other to reinte∣grate their former credite and losses, and dayly fol∣lowed him in the fieldes of <HI>Munster, Westphalia, Pater∣borne,</HI> and other of the Bishop of <HI>Cullens</HI> Diocesse, till at the last they found him neere the towne of <HI>Warebrough,</HI> where they resolued to set vpon him: but yet they found him not so vnprouided, either as they conceiued, or wished. For by the meanes of Duke <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Sonderbergh,</HI> vnckle to the king of <HI>Den∣marke,</HI>
<PB REF="8"/>a 1000. horse was newly come to him out of <HI>East-Freesland</HI> and <HI>North-Holland,</HI> vnder the com∣mand of Captain <HI>Iohn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>honson</HI> of the <HI>Hage,</HI> with cer∣taine other souldiers, who all prepared themselues to fight with this new commer, the forenamd Prince of <HI>Anholt,</HI> who greedy of honour, and willing to rank himselfe in the Catalogue of famous Captaines, came brauely vpon that battaile, wherein the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> was fronted, nor was this rashly done, or as I may say in spleene and fury, but vpon great aduise and deliberation. For besides the <HI>Carbines</HI> that charged most violently, the Battalion was flan∣ked with Musketeers, who powred their shot into <HI>Brunswickes</HI> battailes, and had the fortune to kill some of his men. For this was done so brauely, that his troopes were driuen to recoyle, and vpon that staggering many thought he was slaine: for his horse was shot vnder him, and in that amase the people ru∣moured his death.</P>
<P>This was a hard beginning, and put the souldiers in a shrewd feare: For a whole Cornet of horse was shiuered, and <HI>Brunswicke</HI> lay for the time vnder foot, but it lasted not long: for his youth and courage got the victory of astonishment, and vp he gets, and vp he mounts againe, first causing the Captaines to to fill vp the roome with a body of pikes, who kept the enemies horse from comming too forward: then did he charge them with fresh horse, and ere they could wheele about to bring their pistols bulleted he put them all to rowt, and so was quittance with them for their first branery: but taking another bo∣dy of pikes, and finding the enemies Battalion some∣what
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>thin of Musketeers, he set vpon them in such a manner, that he powred into them at the least three shot for one, and iust at the same time charged them to their very faces, and had a braue dispatch, had not the second time his horse beene slaine vnder him, and his second fall, made his owne companie let fall their pikes, whereby they were daunted, and de∣tained from further prosecution, whereas question∣lesse else they had made an end of that battaile, and that batttaile had sure determined this controuersie.</P>
<P>But vp hee gets againe, and vp hee mounts with courage and alacrity, and with that fury that hee ouerpressed his enemies, and gaue such example and encouragement to his Captaines, and soul∣diers, that in all the good Discipline of a skir∣mish) I cannot call it a battaile, because the main battailes neuer came to fight) they seconded one a∣nother, that the shot kild three hundred, at three vol∣lies, and the pikes trooped, as it were, to make the more hast to rescue their braue Generall, who thus a∣nimated, set those horse on worke that were neerest and when the enemy began to shake, he pressed them so violently, that many fell vnder his sword, and by computation, this skirmish continued foure long houres, and surely had continued longer, if a braue <HI>Spanish</HI> Captaine newly come out of <HI>Gulicke,</HI> had not brought vp certaine Hargubush on horsebacke, and vnlookt for powred many shots into the pikes, which were ready to mingle with the Colonenses, and at appoynt to end the businesse, whereat the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> enraged came so audacious∣ly, that a Bullet grazed on his shoulder, and the
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>winde of many Bullets made him fall once againe from his horse, inso much that a <HI>Wallon</HI> Captaine (as it was reported) stepped vnto him, supposing to take him prisoner, but as he was lame in body, his businesse succeeded as lamely: for to preuent the mischiefe, one <HI>Remigius</HI> a <HI>Dane</HI> opposed the lame Captaine, and in the sight of the armies slue him outright, hauing thereby time to fetch vp <HI>Brunswicks</HI> horse, and comfort to see him a liue, and vnhurt.</P>
<P>Thus is hee mounted the third time, and percei∣ning the skirmish continue in some equalitie though the enemy had had the greater losse hee caused cer∣taine field peeces of aduantage to be brought vp to the side of an hill, and mounted them so neere, that they were effectuall to the vnframing of a whole bo∣dy of pikes, vpon whose dis-vniting some fresh com∣panies came in and so played their parts, that well breathed horse couragiously gaue a new assault, and being well seconded, all was as well ended: for here were slaine 5000. and 800. taken prisoners. Besides, Prince <HI>Anholt</HI> Generall of the <HI>Bauarian</HI> forces, who was also taken prisoner by the worthy Commander the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke:</HI> and the Bishop had notice of a greater slaughter, which made him somewhat sad and afflicted, till vnderstanding that <HI>Bruns∣wicke</HI> was shot, and had lost foure hundred men, hee was then cheered againe, and a noble Pre∣late and Prince of Germanie, imputed all to the chance of war, and to the decider of controuersies: notwithstanding this seeming shew of vndaunted
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>courage, he suspected least the great Citie of <HI>Collen,</HI> would animate the Souldiers to spoile, and make their approaches neerer and neerer, so hee retires himselfe to a strong Castle of his owne, vnderstan∣ding that the Bishop of <HI>Spiers</HI> had remoued to <HI>Cop∣len,</HI> and resolued to secure himselfe within the strength of the Castle of <HI>Thermonsteno,</HI> as for the Bi∣shop of <HI>Monts:</HI> it was told him he had leaue of the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> or if you had rather the King of <HI>France,</HI> to keepe his Court in <HI>Mets,</HI> a strong forti∣fied Towne and frontier Citie, which in those dayes held out against the Emperour, and is still the bulwarke and fortresse of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and odly hold in <HI>Loraine</HI> to secure the Countrey.</P>
<P>This is that, which is written of the Duke of <HI>Brunswicks</HI> proceedings, but would I had time to write more: For he is a worthy Gentleman, and re∣solute Souldier, their lackes but some yeares to ma∣ture his iudgement, and bring these good begin∣nings to prosperous ends, of which there is no doubt. For commonly forwards Springs, if to bit∣ter and hard Frosts doe not nip the buds, are not onely comforts for the time, but presagers of plen∣tifull Haruests: and thus much for <HI>Brunswicks</HI> pro∣ceedings; now to the rest, but especially Count <HI>Mansfield.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 Concerning the Earle of <HI>Mansfield</HI> and his strong Army, many remarkable things are written, which as briefly as I can I will succinctly abreuiate into these heads. 1. First, that vnderstanding, that all the Catholick Bishops were fled, hee garisoned
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>most of Army in their strong holds, and quartred them in the Villages, whereby as they say in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> they had Ministrels fare, meate, drinke, and money. 2. Secondly, that when he perceiued his Army to encrease, and now to be so strong, that the Monarchs of <HI>Europe</HI> looke vpon him with repining eyes, as wondering to what purpose he taketh such large steps ouer the Catholick Countries, he made a defence or Apologie, diuulging it in the French tongue, and deliuered the Post of <HI>England, Balam</HI> by name, one of them to carie ouer with him. 3. Third∣ly, that vnderstanding of the Duke of <HI>Brunswicks</HI> conflicts, hee writ Letters of gratification, and not onely applauded his actions, but requested a certificate from his owne hands, who returned an∣swere, how he had preuailed in many skirmishes: burnt <HI>Westerkotton, Erquetts, Amruth,</HI> one of the <HI>Ge∣secks, Ruden, Vberhagen,</HI> and the <HI>Diosarts</HI> house of <HI>Werdell</HI> come from <HI>Lipstat,</HI> wherein hee had like to haue beene betrayed with 25. Cornets of Horie, 6000. Foot, diuers Peeces of Ordnance, Fireworks, scaling Ladders, and many Pyoners: vpon a de∣signe of importance out, he suddenly heard of the approach of the Bishops forces, and so was com∣pelled to stay and augment his Army, for a more fiercer encounter: and that he had taken some pri∣soners, and some Friers, who were so obstinate, that they cryed out vpon nothing but treason and re∣bellion. 4. Fourthly, that while hee was at <HI>Germe∣shem,</HI> and retired to many places with his maine Ar∣mie, Sir <HI>Horace Vere</HI> writing for some supplies, hee
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>sent to <HI>Mainhem</HI> foure Regiments of foot, some money, and munition, besides many suppliments of victuall, and other prouision, whereof the Gari∣son there stood in great neede. For in truth thus it was with the English Generall at this time, all the forces hee had were partly secured in <HI>Main∣hem, Franckendale,</HI> and <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> partly Gariso∣ned in the Villages, and partly running vp and downe for sorraging, and other prouision: so that euery day in one place or other, hee was troubled with the Bauarians, and Monsieurs <HI>Tillyes</HI> Alarums, whose Souldiers might wel be called the Regiment <HI>Voluntes:</HI> For they neuer lay long quiet in a place, but had many imployments, as <HI>Bauaria</HI> vnderstood of the Enemies proceedings, and Emperours plea∣sure, whereupon suspecting what they might doe vpon aduantage, he sent to Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and was supplied accordingly: For without contro∣uersie, he cast vp his accounts in this manner. That my Lord <HI>Chichester</HI> was long a comming with sup∣ply into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> but leaue the care of that to the Maiestie of <HI>England,</HI> &amp; that if the Spaniards and Bauarians should be remoued by way of rendition of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> or cōposition for a peace, yet God knowes what might happen ere the businesse were fully established, and the peace absolutely con∣cluded vpon: wherefore to strengthen himselfe, and to be informed of the state of all affaires, he writ to Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> as you haue heard, and had not onely supply, but Letters of comfort concerning his resolution, to continue constant to the Prince
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>his Master.</P>
<P N="5">5. Fiftly, that as he had fortified <HI>Haggenaw,</HI> hee would come and besiege <HI>Lodenburg,</HI> and so prepare if neede be against <HI>Oppenheim,</HI> all which hee meant to doe with the third part of his forces: For he was perswaded if the worst came, no further supply would enter into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> either from the Spaniard or Emperour, considering it was vnfur∣nished, and that <HI>Gonzules</HI> lay quiet, as if he had had a charge to fight no more. Befides wants so encrea∣sed, that the Countrey was not able to sustaine an Army on any side. For the English were hardly driuen, and hardly releeued. <HI>Gonzales</HI> had beene put to the triall of eating his horses: Monsieur <HI>Til∣ley</HI> perplexed with hunger &amp; seuerall imployment, so that he had scarce 5000. men left, and they sub∣iect to sicknesse, and other encombrances. The Ba∣uarians in the same predicarment vexed with sick∣nesse and cold, although the Emperour had hether∣to sent many helpes, and renewed their decayed Souldiers: and the Townes, though the riuers brought in prouision, because the Country people were reasonably payed, yet felt the scarcity: For victuals grew deere in the Market, and the Burgers were glad to keepe good order without ryot or ex∣cesse: yea, in many places Officers were set, as su∣peruisours, that neither the rich engrossed the Corne, Wine, nor meat, nor the poore should be starued for want of necessaries. These things con∣sidered, hee tooke the more care in comming for∣ward, and pestring the Countrey with his forces to
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>no purpose, but in my conscience made acquain∣ted with the King of <HI>Bohemias</HI> retiring, he prepared to speake with him, and so to attend to bring their businesse to some perfection, as God shall giue way vnto the same.</P>
<P N="6">6. Sixthly, that seeing he had visited <HI>Alsatia</HI> all this Winter, and was in a manner Master of <HI>Leo∣paldus</HI> his Countrey, he would sure keepe what hee had gotten, and therefore as the Spaniard had taught him, and led the way in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> hee would fortifie the strongest places, and when all failed, put the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> in many possession of Prouinces for his owne <HI>Palatinate,</HI> if not set the Crowne of <HI>Prague</HI> more firmely on his head, then ouer it was before.</P>
<P N="7">7. Seuenthly, that seeing his endeuours had put him in a manner in possession of foure Imperiall Cities, namely, <HI>Haggenaw, Spires, Wormes,</HI> and <HI>Ments,</HI> and that hee had brought them to the dis∣bursement of what money he listed, he saw no rea∣son to let slip such opportunity, but either keepe them in awe by his Armies, or make vse of their seuerall Countries, to recompence the King of <HI>Bohemiahs</HI> losses, vntill a better time approach of better booty, which no doubt was now breaking out with the day to shew, that the Sunne of glory was ready to come out of his Chamber, to dispell and banish away the contagious vapours of former trouble and discomforts.</P>
<P N="8">8. Eighthly, that when the Emperour, or Duke of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> for the Emperour, by the aduice
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>of the Bishop of <HI>Collen</HI> had sent vnto him to know, by what authority or in whose name hee either rai∣sed, or kept together such an Army: hee answered plainely and resolutely, in Gods name, and the Kings, meaning the King of <HI>Bohemia:</HI> whereupon to expresse himselfe accordingly, he contriued this deuise for his Ensigne, or colours a radiant Sunne in an Azure field, dispelling a many slender and va∣porous clouds into a corner: thus hee not onely iustifies his actions, and emboldneth his Souldiers, but payeth his Army, and hath an orderly Treasu∣rer for their monethly entertainment, according to the preyes and spoiles they take: yea, to order his businesse the better, he is now coyning thousands of Rikes dollers with this deuice, an arme comming out of a cloud, holding a sword poynant vpward, with a Iesuites Cap pierc'd through: the Motto round about, <HI>Amicus dei omnibus suis inimicis inimi∣cus.</HI> 9. Ninthly, that although many Friers and o∣ther Preachers vsed as many fearefull inuectiues against the Warre, the causes, the Authors, and ef∣fects, shewing plainly, it was a curse of God where∣soeuer it lighted: yet did he giue way vnto the Sun, as if hee were willing to confesse as much, intima∣ting by many of his speeches, that the Emperour, though he had wrong done him first by the <HI>Proge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ses:</HI> yet tooke a wrong course to inflict the King of <HI>Bohemians</HI> children, with the losse of their inheri∣tance for their Fathers fault: as for their Father, many a Christian heart did thinke it reuenge suffi∣cient to haue <HI>Prague</HI> surrendred, and to see the <HI>Pala∣tine</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>disappointed of the Kingdome, in which hee was crowned and inuested: but still to haue his Countrey deuasted, the territories depopulated, the Cities terrified with Souldiers: the Vines spoi∣led, the Woods cut downe, the cattell caried away, and all things subiect to the robberies of Souldiers, was too grieuous a reuenge, and vnmeasurable in∣flicting: yet this was not all neither. For besides the bringing in of strange Nations, and a strange Religion to a religious Countrey, he had by way of donation, enfeoffed another with the same, not re∣membring, what eternall hate might grow hereaf∣ter betweene these two families, when peraduen∣ture all the power of <HI>Austria,</HI> nor the Empire should not reconcile them, which things orderly conside∣red with many other dangerous to be published in a triuiall or common discourse, made his actions the more iustifiable, considering the proceedings were so terrible, and although the Iesuites aymed at him in their Sermons, as the Author of those fearefull effects, and prodigious calamities, which the best Warre must procure: yet all the world knowes the Spaniards were possessours of the one side, and <HI>Bauaria</HI> was entred in the other, before euer he set footing therein, or tooke this course of the Warres diuersion, which by Gods grace and fa∣uour, who set him on worke, hee would prosecute as long as life lasted, or the King of <HI>Bohemias</HI> busi∣nesse hung in suspence.</P>
<P N="10">10. Tenthly, that seeing the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> hath finished the bridge ouer the Neckar, and cau∣sed
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>diuers Wagons to come that way already with Corne and other prouision, and that Monsieur <HI>Til∣ley</HI> quartereth himselfe neere <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> as though he meant to besiege the same, or at least tarry the time, till <HI>Bauarias</HI> forces be renewed, that ioyning together, they may performe their worke effectu∣ally, whereby it is so giuen out in <HI>England,</HI> and ma∣ny are credulous of such an impossibility: he is re∣solued to shew them no fauour, wheresoeuer hee come: but as hee hath visited <HI>Laudenburg,</HI> and the strong Castle of <HI>Magdenburg,</HI> belonging to the Bi∣shoprick of <HI>Spires,</HI> he will also come to <HI>Bessing,</HI> and the Marquesse of <HI>Danstarrats</HI> Countrey, who was euer an Enemy to the Princes of the Vnion: for feare whereof the people haue already vnfurnisht their fields of their Cattle, and caried their goods into the strongest holds, at which Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> smiles to thinke, that poore Castles &amp; Forts should secure them, when so many Cities and wel fortified places haue submitted to his mercy, and made their attonement with him, yea the other day the Catho∣licks about <HI>Spiers</HI> and <HI>Wormes,</HI> seeing the good be∣hauiour of his Souldiers, that they neither raui∣shed women, nor murthered men, but onely tooke the pilledge of the Countrey, rifled the houses, the common custome, and fairest course of a conquering Army, condiscended, and by a ge∣nerall consent agreed to allow him 3000. mea∣sures of Corne, 200. Fats of Wine, and 60000. Flo∣rines, which though he did not accept of, as a full satisfaction to his demaunds, yet did hee take in
<PB REF="13"/>good part for the present, and knew that if necessi∣ty should occasion, they would be drawne to a fur∣ther composition and disbursement.</P>
<P>Thus for the time he desisted from vrging them to more then they were willng to graunt, conside∣ring he had formerly drawne great summes of mo∣ney out of their Treasuries: whereupon he procee∣ded to visite other Countries, and therein onely to take an oath of the Inhabitants of loyalty and fide∣lity to the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and seruice and atten∣dancie to himselfe, and so he passed to the other side of the <HI>Rhine</HI> into the Countries of <HI>Didishene</HI> and <HI>Anoth,</HI> where the people seemed to wish well vnto the King of Bohemia, and very willingly tooke their Oath: then passed hee to the Graue of Louensteins Countrey, which lyeth within the Bishopricke of Spires, and taking the same Oath of the inhabitants, he quietly receiued such prouision and money, as they would willingly spare: heere hee receiued newes that Monsieur <HI>Tilly</HI> had brought his Ordi∣nance, or Artillery to a place called Huscharen, as if he meant to goe to Heidelbergh indeed, but he let him alone, as resoluing, that though he had power to his will, yet hee should not attempt any enter∣prise of worth and moment, without interception: but assured, that neither Bauaria could proceed in any such designe, nor durst he lying so neare, but let them alone, till he had further directions from him, whō he longs to speake withall; so that in my Con∣science when that oportunity shal present her hairy soretop vnto him, he will onely march through the
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>Palatinate into Bauaria's owne Countrey, and ei∣ther make him looke to a new busines, or inrich his Army with the spoyle, that hee may be the better prouided to passe into Bohemia it selfe.</P>
<P N="11">11. Eleauenthly, though he heard, that <HI>Don Cor∣dua</HI> in person was risen from the Towne of Crus∣nach to goe to Openhem, and fortifie the Bridge with Sconces to hinder all passengers, but such, whom the Court of Guard shall license: yet when he saw he slacked the same, hee conceiued he had some speciall charge to proceed no further against the English, till the Emperours Ambassador were returned, and they knew what to trust vnto from <HI>England:</HI> So that one way hee found the people glad, that there was any glimmering light of Peace toward, and another way feared it would be a barre vnto his Designes, if the King of Bohemia should by any meanes be ouer-ruled, or perswaded to easie Condition, and tractates of Friendship: but resol∣ued not to be disturbed with conceit, or meditation of such busines, which yet hung in suspence, or were Coniecturall, he presently put himselfe into Acti∣on, and ouerlooked his Fortifications and places, wherein he had Garrison'd his Souldiers, and set vp his rest to attend the good houre of further pro∣secutions.</P>
<P N="12">12. Twelthly, it was somewhat vnpleasing vnto him, that his Forces had layne so long before the Castle of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gdenburg,</HI> and spent as hee thought so much time to his disgrace, and hindring his other designes, whereupon he went thither in person and
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>tooke away all meanes from them of succor and re∣liefe, which when they perceiued, and were now debarred from former supportation, being old Sol∣diers and of great experience, they came to capitu∣late the matter, and surrendred the place vpon Con∣dition to saue their liues, and depart with Bag and baggage, which they did without Colours display∣ed, or any show of a Souldier; by which occasion Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> tooke possession of the same, and found therein more wealth, then either he had at Spiers or Wormes: Thus did he preuaile in his ac∣tion, and is now Lord of many Countries &amp; holds, attending the good houre of the King of Bohemia's comming to him, or sending for him: and so leaue him to the glory and in the fulnes of ioy, for this last good successe, which hath made him more confi∣dent &amp; resolute to ouersway nicer exceptions, and goe forward in his pretences, though as yet he hath not fully expressed the same concerning particulars.</P>
<P>Hauing thus left Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> in security, full of wealth, Glory, and assurance to bring his purpo∣ses to a happy period. Let vs now come to other matters, not yet impertinent though not altogether depending vpon the former: You haue heard I am sure by many relations published long since, that Duke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> Lord of Elsas and Alsatia, was in a manner driuen out of his Countrey by the Forces of <HI>Mansfield:</HI> yet prettily salued that wound with this cure, that he went into the Valtolina, as Gene∣rall for the King of Spaine, though in his hart he re∣pined at such an Vsurpation, which was euer belon∣ging
<PB N="22" REF="15"/>to the Gouernment of another Prince. For of late the House of Austria condiscended, that Spaine should haue the prerogatiue, as hee had the Forces and stronger hand to holde them close to his Migh∣tines and preuayling. Well? heere hee mustered Soldiers and tooke vp two Regements to supply o∣ther Armies, but in the midst of this iollity, as hee was running away with hopes of recouery or re∣uenge: the money which was promised him out of Spaine fayled, and he could neither goe forward in that busines, nor durst returne into his owne Coun∣trey for feare of greater forces, or more violent op∣position: But some report, that the Emperour sent him word, that hee was willing to a generall Peace and for that purpose had sent Count <HI>Siratzenburg</HI> into England as his Ambassador, and therfore there needed no such hastines to giue any cause of suspiti∣on, that hee meant not sincerely as he professed: This treaty of Peace set all humors and dispositions on worke, and the Prouinces were as it detayned between feare and gladnes, what would be the issue of the same, as for the <HI>Grizons</HI> &amp; <HI>Swisse?</HI> they shew∣ed <HI>Leopoldus</HI> a face of discontent euery way, and brought out olde Records, wherein the Kings of France were authentically sworne to bee their Pro∣tectors, how euer now they slacked the same, and gaue way to anothers Greatnes, the like might be said of the Palatinate, Cleue, and other bordering Prouinces vpon the Empire, and confines of Bur∣gundy: but times are alterers of mens purposes, and Kingdomes are eaten out with contraries; &amp; taught
<PB N="27" REF="15"/>to know a lesson of Humiliation, when the Lord of all Kingdomes will admit of other Stewards, then he first placed: Thus <HI>Leopoldus</HI> must be content to see another man in possessiō of many of his Townes, and other Prouinces of the Bishops, aswell as the Palatinate was at the same instant vsurped by stran∣gers, and had indeed too many Masters.</P>
<P>Amongst other hopes and helpes, that the King of Bohemia hath, the Marquesse of <HI>Ieggendorffe</HI> is not the least. For hee mustreth Soldiers dayly both in Silesia and Morauia, yea hath had supply out of Walachia: and at this houre is doubtfull, whether he shall entertaine the <HI>Tartars</HI> or no, who came both to him and <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> by thousands, and resolue to assist them, if need be against the Emperour, so that there is a great feare in Preslaw and Gratz, Cit∣ties of Silesia, what shall become of them, if any al∣teration happen: whereupon the Lords and States raise vp many Forces, fortifie their Citties, prouide men, money, and munition, stand at a stay for their submission, and doe neither openly warrant the Emperour their absolute Obedience, nor priuately wish ill to the King of Bohemia's proceedings, with which kinde of neutrality the Emperor is so displea∣sed, that he imputes the fault to the Duke of <HI>Saxo∣nies</HI> negligence, as vnderstanding that many Soul∣diers of Saxony, haue bin licensed to depart home, and the Duke himselfe is weary of the Warre; not∣withstanding these proceedings, and that there is a restraint of the Soldiers fury and violent customes, whereby <HI>Prague</HI> and other places, reduced vnder the
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>Emperours gouernment, doe yet hope and looke after some order for their Religion, and profession of a good conscience: yet doth the Bishop of <HI>Prague</HI> proceede most violently and cruelly against the Protestants, and will not suffer them to professe publiquely either in Churches, or priuate houses, any thing against the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> so that eue∣ry where the Inhabitants or discontented, and pray to God for the diuersion of these mischiefes, that haue not onely dilacerated the peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> but broken the hearts of poore soules to heare God so prophaned, and euery man in his owne particular terrified. For how euer it is reported, that in <HI>Sile∣tia, Lusatia,</HI> and those Countries, there shall be a present assembly at <HI>Easter</HI> of the Lords and States of the Prouinces, yet hath the Bishop of <HI>Newes</HI> fol∣lowed the example of the great Bishop of <HI>Prague,</HI> and locked vp the Churches from the Protestants, and will not suffer the Burgers to make open pro∣fession of their consciences; whereupon by way of petition they haue sollicited the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> to consider their poore estates, and how euer, the Em∣perour must captiuate their bodies and goods; yet to giue them leaue to haue their soules free to be∣stow vpon the God of all freedome, and saluation: to which hee not onely answered very graciously, but gaue way vnder hand to all their Protestant as∣semblies, and religious meetings, so that there is hope and light appearing, that either the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> is and will be discontented with the Empe∣rour, whereby the vehemencie of his proceedings
<PB N="27" REF="16"/>may be slacked, or that hee will suffer the Inhabi∣tants to enioy their owne freedomes, and peace of conscience, to which purpose they haue procured another Mediator, euen Duke <HI>Weymar</HI> of <HI>Saxony</HI> his owne kinsman, who hath not onely professed himselfe a Protestant, but raised two thousand foot, and fiue hundred horse to ioyne with the Duke of <HI>Brunswick</HI> in his proceedings, not doubting very shortly to be partakers of his glory, as well as of his spoiles, and hardly gotten conquests.</P>
<P>Thus are the pure and delicate waters of Eu∣ropes peace troubled and bedirtied with the wan∣ton flingings of cruell handes: For Warre you see hath throwne Blood and corrupted Carkasses into the Sunne: men haue followed one another with Death and reuenge, and so drenched their stincking feete: Women haue bathed their rauished bodies and left their pollution behinde them: Souldiers haue washed their corrupted woundes, and all sorts with one filth or other, haue sought to damme vp the streames, and make the currant (if it were possi∣ble, vnpassible) so that vnlesse the stirring waters get the vpper hand, all will be spoyled, and if it once come to a standing poole, it will stinke and putrifie: but the same God, that sent the Angell to quicken the poole of <HI>Shilo,</HI> that the diseased might be cured, the lame restored, the dropsie healed, the leprous clensed, &amp; all infection purged, wil when he sees his time, performe the like for vs, by turning
<PB N="26" REF="17"/>the inundation another way, and making the Ri∣uers runne smoothly within their own euen bankes, or else he will doe, as he did by the waters of <HI>Mu∣rah,</HI> or by the flood <HI>Iordan,</HI> which was preferred be∣fore the Springes <HI>Damasius</HI> to heale <HI>Naaman</HI> the <HI>Sirian.</HI></P>
<P>To which purpose, let all those, who wish the Peace of <HI>Syon,</HI> and the building vp of the walles of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> bring Incense and Sacrifice to the Altar of the Temple, and there lift vp their handes and hearts, that it may be propitious, and the God of Heauen not only scent a sweet smelling sauour: but giue vs notice of accepting our Prayers, and re∣quests, by seeing the Angell ascend in the flame.</P>
