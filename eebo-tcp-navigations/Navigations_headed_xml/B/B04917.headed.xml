<HEAD>A Particular Relation of the raising of the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and the Defeat of the Turkish Army on the 12th of <HI>September,</HI> 1683.</HEAD>
<P>YOu have already had several Relations of the great Victory which the Confe∣derate Army obtained against the Turks the twelfth instant, but none so exact and particular as that we now give you. The Turks after a Siege of nine Weeks, had reduced this place to that extremity, that it could not have held out <HI>48.</HI> houres longer, for our Provisions failed, our Garison which at first was about <HI>12000.</HI> men, was brought to <HI>6000.</HI> having suffered more by sickness than by the Enemy, and the Turks had three Mines ready to spring, which would in∣fallibly have blown up the last Retrenchment we had made for our security within the Town, when the Christian Army with the Divine Assistance happily reliev∣ed us: Which they would not so easily have done, had the Grand Visier secured the passages of the Wood and other Posts (which the Christians found difficult enough to passe, even though they met with no opposition) but either for want of Foot, or through a vain confidence of his own strength, having still an Army of <HI>120000.</HI> fighting men, he neglected these advantages.</P>
<P>The Christian Army, which consisted of between <HI>70.</HI> and <HI>80000.</HI> men, ad∣vancing towards this place, a great Body of Horse and Dragoons was sent on the 11th to seize the chief Passages and Avenues of the Wood, which the Army having afterward passed, they posted themselves in the evening at the entrance of the Wood, on the side towards the Enemy, and there being a hill at a small distance from them, some Troops were sent to secure it, and all things were dis∣posed for the Battel the next day; the right Wing was given to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> for that he had the most Horse, and that the Countrey was on that side open; the left to the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> because they were strongest in Foot, and that it was an enclosed Countrey all along the <HI>Denube:</HI> and the main Body to the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and Prince <HI>Waldecke.</HI> The next morning by break of day, the Generals, according to appointment, met on the Hill before mentioned, to give the last Orders, and were no sooner come thither, but a Body of about <HI>10000.</HI> Turks appeared, and advanced towards the Christians, whereupon a Battalion was ordered to put themselves into a Vine∣yard that was on a Hill hard by, being supported by three other Battalions, which made the Turks stop, for not enduring the Fire of the said Battalions, and be∣ing all Horse, and in a Ground where they could not well attack the Foot, they contented themselves with making one Discharge, accompanied with a hideous noise, and so retired. Hereupon the King of <HI>Poland</HI> and the other Princes having observed the disposition of the Enemy, drew the Army in three Lines, all closed without any Intervals, and Ordered them to march very slowly towards the Enemy, and to stand when the Turks came to Charge them, to keep themselves very close, and not to Fire till the Enemy had made their discharge, which was accordingly done. The Enemy advanced towards them with a horrible cry, as if they meant to break in upon them, hoping thereby to make them give w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> or to put them into disorder, but perceiving that the Christians stood firm, and expect∣ed them in a very close order, they durst not push any farther, but made a halt, and finding the Christians did not stir, but stood expecting them, they made their discharge and wheeled off, upon which all the first Line of the Christians fired, and that done, the whole Army advanced with a slow pace, and so gained ground upon the Enemy, who returning, came up as before, the Christians thereupon made a halt, and expected them, and the Turks having made their Discharge, again retired, which they repeated several times without ever daring to break in upon the Christians, who still gained Ground, and drove the Turks before them like a flock of Sheep; Being come near the Enemies Camp, a Body of Foot and
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>Dragoons was detached to attack their Cannon, which they made themselves Ma∣sters of without much Opposition, the Enemy having but a small number of Foot to defend them, and even their Horse made no great resistance in any place, though on the side of the right Wing, they endeavoured to charge the Christians in Flank, but the King of <HI>Poland</HI> mistrusting it, caused part of the second Line to advance, and make a Front on that side, and charging the Enemy in Person with the first Line, made them give way. During the hottest of the Battel, the Turks attack∣ed the Town, and pressed the Besieged so hard, that the Count <HI>De Staremberg</HI> was forced to send to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> for assistance, with the help whereof, all the Turks that were in the Attack were cut in pieces. In conclusion, towards night the Enemy began to give way and to fly, the Christians pursuing them beyond their Camp, and there they made a halt, the Souldiers being commanded upon pain of death not to stir out of their Ranks, and the whole Army remained all night in Battalia, as if the Enemy had been still present. The next day the Camp was plundered, half of a Company going out at a time, while the other half continu∣ed in Arms, and when they returned, these went out in like manner. All the Enemies Baggage, Provisions, Tents, <HI>50.</HI> pieces of Cannon, two Horse-Tails, the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s Standard, and the <HI>Visiers</HI>'s own Horse were taken, and most of their Foot were cut in pieces, which it's believed was not above <HI>12.</HI> or <HI>15000.</HI> they having lost an incredible number during the Siege. This great Vi∣ctory which was obtained at so cheap a rate, that the Christians lost not a <HI>1000.</HI> men, and very few Persons of Note, (the Duke <HI>de Croy,</HI> and some others being wound∣ed) must in great measure be attributed to the great Conduct and Bravery of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who engaged in Person among the thickest of the Enemy, having with him the Prince his eldest Son, but <HI>15.</HI> years old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who thus early signalized himself; the Electors of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and Prince <HI>Waldecke,</HI> have likewise gained great Honour and Rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utation, much of the suc∣cess of this great Day being due to them.</P>
