<P>The French with some men, both horse and foot, have surpri∣sed in the suburbs of Cuneo six Spanish Companies of horse, dis∣persed them, and obtained above an hundred horses; whereup∣on, they pillaged the said suburbs, and other neighboring places, and afterwards fired them: they have likewise taken, contrary to their promise, from an Expresse comming from Millaine, who was going towards Thurino, as also from a barge, comming from Barcellona towards Genoa, all the letters.</P>

<P>Of the last thirty waggons, which were going from Frank∣ford towards Collen, the Weymarish have not onely taken away all the goods, but also killed almost all the convoy and wag∣goners,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>for of the waggoners no more but two escaped alive, and nine souldiers came back againe to Frankford, and as we are certified, 43. men were buried in one hole; of the Weymarish were likewise many slaip, amongst which was their Commander, and many wounded; the losse of those waggons is an incredible losse, and will fall heavie upon many men: It is certaine that the Weymarish and French have relieved Bingen; the Electour of Mentz is very much incensed against <HI>Don Verdugo</HI> and other Of∣ficers, because they forsook so soon the siege before Bingen, and left the Artillerie behinde them; we heare nothing as yet, which way the Weymarish took from thence: At Hoechst they will suffer no more that any ship may go downward the Rhyne.</P>

<P>We feare, that Generall <HI>Bannier,</HI> who lyes yet on the frontiers of Bohemia will march hitherwards, because every one of the whole Countrie must bring hither presently and without any de∣lay the halfe part of their corne and provision, and th'other halfe they shall keepe, till they receive further order, insomuch that many are of opinion that Generall <HI>Bannier</HI> will pitch his campe not far from hence on the river of Saala or Unstrat, because the Magazin heere must be fill'd with all speede, and by all appea∣rance Generall <HI>Bannier</HI> strives to draw unto him the Weymarish and Hessish forces, and being the Swedish Colonell <HI>Coningsmark</HI> with his troopes is gone againe towards Quickaw, wherfore the Saxon Regiments are gone againe from Leipzigk towards Zeitz, Naumberg and other places to their old quarters. The Imperiall troopes under the command of Colonel <HI>Gils de Haas</HI> haveleft the siege before Masfeld, and are gone towards Coningshoven, because the Weymarish Colonell <HI>Rosa</HI> is gon with 1000. horsmen towards Mainungen. Betwixt the City and the Duke of Brunswick is like∣ly to be a new warre, because the Duke will not permit unto the Citie to keepe the 2 new yearely faires or Marts, which privi∣ledge was given unto them by the Emperour, they have contradi∣cted it and protested against it, and they have likewise caused all the cattels to be taken away in the open field from the outlandish merchants, which they had bought at Brunswick. The King of Denmark will not diminish the custome in the Sound, but ra∣ther raise the same at Tangermund. 2000.

<P>The differences betwixt the Pope and the French King grow still greater and greater, and it is likewise confirmed, that all the Clergie in France must receive their benefices of the French Bi∣shops &amp; not of the Pope: After the holidais the Governor of Mil∣lane is resolved to go to field with 24000. men both horse and foote, to which end He causeth a bridge to bee laid over the Ri∣ver of Ponere Valenza, and hath sent unto Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> of Sa∣voy a succour of 2000. foote and 2000. horse, who hath block'd up the City of Chivas and ruinated already the mills. The French garrison in the Gastle of Thurino is not above 600. strong, the rest died of the sicknesse, wherefore the French Ge∣nerall Count of Harcourt drawes together at Pignarola all the French forces, and gathers great store of provision and ammuni∣tion
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>to relieve both places, which are in great distresse: through Languedok are marching also 15. French Regiments of foot and six Regiments of horse toward Piemont.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>t this time we have but little newes to write, onely we heare, that the Swedish Gen: Bannier is marching through Misnia towards Erfurd, whether hee will take his way from thence, is not knowne: Some Re∣giments of the Imperiall forces are to goe into Austria to re∣fresh themselves. <HI>Erfurd</HI> the 27. of March. the 6. of Apr:</P>
<P>Gen: Bannier hath a very bad march in his comming back from Bohemia, and in these deep wayes he was faine to put before divers wagons loaden with baggage, 16. and more horses, and before divers peeces of ordnance, he was faine to put from 60. to 70. horses, yet they were not able to draw them through the mire, wherefore Gen: Bannier was forced to put his owne horses before the Canons, and hath cōman∣ded from 5. to 800. musquetiers to draw together with the horses and to get them forward: On wednesday last General Bannier had his head quarter at Qwickaw, and at this pre∣sent he lyes about Altenburg, by al appearance, he wil march through Misnia,, and come to this Citie and pitch his Campe here abouts, to which end divers of his Officers as also his own Nephew are arrived heere with 400. horse men and divers other troopes are to follow them, on th'other side the Imperiall General Piccolomini followeth likewise close, who kept on Sunday last his Randevouz at Annaberg, but he hath onely his horse men about him, &amp; the foot forces together with Arch-Duke Leopold William and the Artil∣lerie follow as fast as they can, which puts these Countries into great terrour, every one in the Countrie must bring pre∣sently the halfe part of his provision into the Magazin, inso∣much that Gen: Banniers comming into these parts progno∣sticates, that he will draw the Weymarish forces unto him, &amp; if they doe not come unto him it is thought, that hee will passe againe the River of Elve and goe towards Lusatia, to which end Colon: Coningsmarck hath about him some 100.

In Prussia are likewislevied great forces for the King of Poland, Lievtenant General Baudissen hath likewise taken service under the said King. The King of Denmarck his forces lie yet in and about Pinneberg, many are of opinion, that some strange businesses will fall out that way, because the Count of Shaumburg is gone towards Hol∣land, who as the report goes, hath taken service under the States.</P>
