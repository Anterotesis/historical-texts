<P>The <HI>Archisynagoga,</HI> or Gouernour of the Iew∣ish Synagogue, who is called <HI>Basseri,</HI> is lately come
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>from <HI>Vienna,</HI> and arriued here, where hee is recei∣ued of his Nation with great honour. For he hauing kept the <HI>Iewes</HI> true to his Imperiall Maiestie, all the time of these <HI>Bohemian</HI> troubles (the <HI>Iewes</HI> better affecting the Catholique Religion, then the refor∣med,) and hauing largely contributed to the warres of the Emperour: his Maiestie hath now rewarded him with a Chayne of Gold, weighing one hundred Ducats, and with his owne picture to hang about his necke, with many other Imperiall gifts, and many fauours also and new priuiledges to his Nati∣on, both for their personall quiet, and the freer ex∣ercise of their Religion. Hee comming neere to this City with fiue Coaches in his trayne, was met vpon the way with diuers <HI>Iewes,</HI> both on Horse and Foote, who conducted him, with great triumph, (af∣ter their fashion) into the Towne, lodging him in their City. Hee was apparrelled after the <HI>Hunga∣rian</HI> fashion: His Cloake was of redde Veluet, his Sword and Spurres guilded, and he ware the afore∣said Chayne about his necke, with the Emperours picture hanging at it.</P>

<P>The execution of the <HI>Bohemian</HI> Lords, is now bet∣ter knowne to be made, for these reasons; and these men haue beene, and are to be executed: First, those that were present when the other Catholique Lords were thrown out at the window, as they sate in Coun∣cell together, about the putting out of the Empe∣rour,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>from being King of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> Secondly, all those that can be found, to haue beene of confedera∣cie with those that conspired against his Imperiall Maiestie, and the House of <HI>Austria.</HI> Thirdly, those that were present at the reiection of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Emperour.

<P>Here is arriued a Bauarian Commissioner in the name of his Imperiall Maiestie, and his highnesse of <HI>Bauaria;</HI> his request is; That the Burgomaster of our cittie, would permit him to leauy certaine soul∣diers in our towne and thereabouts, for the Em∣perors seruice. And that they might likewise be maintained at the charge of the Citizens, and be billetted in their houses vntill the generall muster. But the Burgomaster hath excused himselfe, from granting either of these requests. By this we see that the Emperour hath some other emploiment for them, for <HI>Monsieur Tilly</HI> thinkes himselfe strong enough in the Palatinate; and those that besieged <HI>Glatz,</HI> haue long since and often refused the aides of some thousands of Cossacks, who offered them their seruice.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="8" REF="6"/>(as we then heard) yet it is since knowne that to the great griefe of the country thereabouts, they are there still staid: and for that the Prin∣ces of the Empire are loath to haue so many rude fellowes, passe through their countryes, and for that the Emperour findes by experience of others of their Nation, who went before, how he is like to be troubled with them: it is said that they are to be sent into the low Countries; for that the Spanish armie hath had there no good successe, and is also much weakned in Brabant. Of which last part of the newes, it is said that the Prince, Archbishop Elector of <HI>Cullen,</HI> had this word also sent to <HI>Hanaw,</HI> (where he then lay a∣bout October, in his iourney towards the Dyet of <HI>Regenspurg</HI>) that these Cossacks were very like∣ly to be sent into Brabant, to reenforce the Spa∣nish companies, which are farre more in the List then they are in the Polle.</P>

<P>NOt long before the Campe of the Prince of <HI>O∣range</HI> brake vp from <HI>Rossendale,</HI> the Marquesse <HI>Spinola</HI> sent a Trumpet to the Prince, with the Ritt∣master, (Captaine of a horse troope) <HI>Abremon,</HI> to treat about keeping faire quarter on both sides; whereas before there had beene some violent disor∣ders committed on both parties, against the Law of Armes. Whereupon 15. committees were appoin∣ted for each side, who met together at a village cal∣led <HI>Calmpthout</HI> betweene <HI>Bergen vp Zoome,</HI> and <HI>Ant∣werpe:</HI> on our side, there went among others, the Baron of <HI>Sterkenburgh,</HI> and the noble <HI>Drossard Bro∣chum.</HI> At first they could not well agree, so that they were ready to depart: but at last the matter was brought to this point, That an Earle being taken Prisoner should pay for his ransome 10000. Gilders, a Campemaster 1000. a Captaine 600. a Leifetenant 150. an Ancient, Sergeant, horseman and foot sol∣dier, each accordinglie to his pay. Thus was it con∣cluded at <HI>Calmpthout, October</HI> 16. 1622. and with this the Committees returned to their Quarters.</P>

<P>THE Spanish Forces lie still about the villages of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and some of them haue been seen about <HI>Venlo</HI> in <HI>Gelderland,</HI> which passe there ouer the
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>bridge, and it was said that more should follow them, but we haue heard no more of them, or that they en∣tended any thing else, then to reenforce their Garri∣sons, and especially to strengthen the towne of <HI>Goch.</HI></P>

<P>THE 15. of this moneth, there went some horse∣men from hence, who fell vpon a Convoy of the enemies, consisting of 3. troope of horse, whereof they killed one of the Captaines, whose dead body with 27. prisoners they brought away with them, the which day there went out a party of 80. of our horsemen to <HI>Herentall,</HI> and passed through 180. of the enemies horse, and tooke 80. of them prisoners, and brought away 33. of them, the rest ransomed themselues. There was the best horse of <HI>Grobben∣donces</HI> troope, called the <HI>Gens,</HI> taken, they haue got∣ten 162. Gilders by the sale of these horses.</P>
<P>The 17. day there were there sold 58. of the Ene∣mies horse, with saddles, bridles, and pistols, which were brought from little <HI>Brabant.</HI> These exploits wee giue you vpon the credit of their owne Lowe Dutch newes.</P>

<P>Our Soldiers haue beene nere the towne of <HI>Lyer,</HI> and haue taken good prize and prisoners, and a∣mongst the rest, there was one old cruell man, called
<PB N="17" REF="10"/><HI>Schapaetien,</HI> who had before caused many of our sol∣diers to be shot to death when they were taken pri∣soners: this fellow was by our men serued likewise. And these things the <HI>Hollanders</HI> tell of the actions of their owne men, but impart nothing that should make for the honor of any of <HI>Spinolaes,</HI> of whose do∣ings, they suffer vs to knowe little.</P>

<P>THE order of the Rising was this; There being many ships and boats in a readinesse to attend: There was first shipt the greatest peices of Cannon, and his Excellency with the small peeces of Cannon and some falconets marched towards <HI>Oudenbergh,</HI> many hundreds of ships being there in a readinesse, where one part of our foot went aboard. In the meane time our horse stood ranged in battell array, vntill the foot were shipt. After this, his Excellencie being accompanied with many Noblemen, Lords, Rittmasters, Captaines and other Cavalliers, mar∣ched to <HI>Breda:</HI> where hauing put all things in order, the most part of our Cavalliery with his Excellency, and Prince <HI>Henry Van Nassaw,</HI> and Count <HI>Ernestus</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> besides many other Noblemen and braue Warriours, with the soldiers of Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> were by his Excellency sent higher vpwards, and their Rendezvous was at St. <HI>Grauenwert,</HI> from whence it was thought, that the horse might well and safely march, as far as into the Bishopricke of <HI>Cullen,</HI> and keepe house there so ratime</P>

<P>The Campe rose vpon Fryday, and the Wednes∣day after, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> returned to the <HI>Hagh,</HI> being brauely receiued by the foure companyes of Townesmen.

<P>THe Horsemen of the States one day amongst the rest, brought in a booty valued at 6000. pound sterling: which made many of their fingers itch, to be doing with the Spaniards also: But his Excellency saith; that hee will beat them well enough, with ly∣ing still.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> is safe returned to the <HI>Hagh,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> and <HI>Count Mansfield,</HI> tooke vp Souldiers for <HI>Westphalia.</HI> The States also take vp Souldiers, for all it is towards winter.</P>

<P>THe Marquesse of <HI>Baden</HI> was arriued at the <HI>Hagh,</HI> before his Excellency came thither; and so like∣wise was the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and the <HI>Count Mans∣field,</HI> hauing consulted with the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> a∣bout some important businesse, and knowing that his Souldiers were already marcht vpwards, tooke his leaue of his Maiesty and the Queene, and went with all speed, together with the Marquesse of <HI>Ba∣den,</HI> to the place where his Souldiers lay: and vnder∣standing
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>of some disorders committed by some of them, he punisht them with the <HI>Strappado,</HI> and other bodily punishments. Hee is since this marcht vp∣wards.</P>

<P>AFter all this, the Lords the States looking as well to the businesse of the Spanish Fleete, as they haue done to their Land Armie, haue taken vp al the ships (Merchants and others) that are fit to beare Ordnance, for their seruice. And for the speeding of their fleete which they haue put out to sea, they write from <HI>Amsterdam, Octob.</HI> 31. That the ships of <HI>Holland</HI> haue lately fought with 5. Spanish Car∣ricks, (being of those that went to <HI>Argire,</HI>) and beat them.</P>
<P>In <HI>London</HI> also the newes is from <HI>Plimmoth,</HI> that in the end of <HI>October,</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> hauing 50. sayle of ships about these Seas, haue lately fought with some of the Spanish Fleete; and with their shot so rack't through one galleon, that she being no longer able to liue at Sea, put into harbour at <HI>Plimmouth,</HI> which she had much adoe to recouer without sinck∣ing: and what worke the rest of the two Feets made one with another, we haue not yet heard off.</P>

<P>VVEE heare also from sundry places, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> haue taken away the Barrels and o∣ther Seamarkes, that the Spanish Fleete may haue no direction to find their hauens, if they should offer to fall in with any of their coasts.</P>
<P>But now for the maintenance of this Land Army and great Fleete at Sea, they haue taken the same course, that the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> hath done in his do∣minions, That is, they haue laid a generall Taxati∣on by the polle: for man, woman and child is to giue a Gilder (that is 2. shillings English,) and the 500 pennie besides of his goods: so that he that is worth 500. pound, is to giue 20 shillings towards the wars, which will amount to an inestimable summe of mo∣ney, for women, children, seruants and all must pay it. Yea the very poore that receiue Almes also, for whom the Collectors must pay it, as it is said.</P>

<P>THE 20. of this month, there happened a most lamentable accident, by shipping one Oxehead, and two Firkins of Gunpowder, and yet no certain∣tie can be had how it tooke fire: but so it is, that the fire taking it, as it lay vpon the keye side, ready to be caried a ship-board: It gaue such a cracke: that on both sides of the hauen, almost all the tyles of the houses, and the glasse-windowes, were shaken down, and many things within the houses also, throwne
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>downe and broken. Besides all this, some men, wo∣men and chlidren were blowne vp into the aire; so that in some places farre and neere from thence, was found here an Arme, &amp; there a Leg, here one head, and there another, and in other places, hands, feete, Armes, Hearts, Gutts, Liuers, and other parts of mens bodies; and by it a man burnt to death. In fine, this was such a lamentable spectacle to behold, and so fearefull, that it cannot be well expressed, It is a memorable warning to euery man that is to deale with this damnable Gun powder, to looke to it well and warilie.</P>
