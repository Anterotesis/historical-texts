<L>ARe all Pens silent, is there none to tell</L>
<L>How the Brave <HI>George</HI> near <HI>Sables-Island</HI> fell?</L>
<L>Why such Ingratitude? his Merit's much</L>
<L>Better deserve, then thus a Verse to grutch</L>
<L>In memory of him, who for to save</L>
<L>His King's and Countries honour, found a Grave</L>
<L>In deepest Seas, yet shall his Memory,</L>
<L>Not thus be buried in obscurity.</L>
<L>Nor shall base— <HI>Bostoners,</HI> curst Sons of <HI>Cham,</HI></L>
<L>Who with false lyes, and tales mankind would sham</L>
<L>E're blast thy Glory, though their black mouth's said,</L>
<L>Thy Ship and Men, were to the <HI>French</HI> betray'd.</L>
<L>Say then my Muse, and faithfully relate</L>
<L>The time, and cause that usher'd in his fate.</L>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<L>Near twice Ten years, betrusted with Commands</L>
<L>In Warlike Ships, in midst of Armed Bands</L>
<L>On all occasions he his Country serv'd,</L>
<L>And from the Post of danger never swerv'd;</L>
<L>Always a Victor, and by Heaven's decree</L>
<L>Preserv'd till this his finall destiny.</L>
<L>'Twas near th' <HI>Americ</HI> strand when twice 12 days</L>
<L>The Glorious Sun had guilded with his Rays</L>
<L>Fair <HI>Maia</HI>'s bosome. In the Frigot <HI>Rose</HI></L>
<L>Ploughing the Ocean to seek out his foes,</L>
<L>And save his Convoy-Fleet, anon appears</L>
<L>A Lusty <HI>French</HI> Ship, after her he stears.</L>
<L>Twenty odd Guns on either side hawl'd out</L>
<L>Seamen and Soldiers full four hundred stout.</L>
<L>The <HI>Rose</HI> a Fifth Rate, not full thirty Guns,</L>
<L>Sixscore brave Lads, burthen 3 hundred Tuns.</L>
<L>And when in Call demands, whence your ship, hoy?</L>
<L>The <HI>Frenchman</HI> cry'd, me tell you by and by</L>
<L>Strike to the <HI>King of France</HI> then forthwith cry'd</L>
<L>No, no, <HI>Monsieur,</HI> we'l first well bang your hide,</L>
<L>Cry'd Valiant <HI>George,</HI> nor shall it e're be told</L>
<L>To <HI>England</HI>'s King his Ship so cheap I sold.</L>
<L>Scarce said, when thund'ring Eccho's pierce the sky</L>
<L>From <HI>English</HI> Marriners, who <HI>French</HI> defy.</L>
<L>Shrill Trumpets, and loud Drums do now invite</L>
<L>The dull and timorous to a bloody Fight:</L>
<L>Then thundring Cannons mixt with Fire and smoak</L>
<L>Send pondrous balls, piercing well-season'd Oak,</L>
<L>Which in their passage to the briny deeps</L>
<L>Numbers of souls lull in Eternal sleeps,</L>
<L>From the Main-topps and quarter-Decks like hail</L>
<L>In showers of Lead, each other now assail:</L>
<L>Now might you see the Rigging cut in twain</L>
<L>And nimble fingers splicing it again.</L>
<L>Ten thousand splinters from all quarters fly,</L>
<L>The sayls hard Bullets pierce then pass toth' sky:</L>
<L>Some spunge the Guns, others dire powder bear,</L>
<L>Loading with chain-shot is anothers care:</L>
<L>All bent to kill, or take, or burn, or both,</L>
<L>No Room is left for Cowardice or sloath.</L>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<L>The Curled Ensigns now are cut in twain,</L>
<L>Streight, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aring Sailers put them up again.</L>
<L>And now th' affrighted fishes from the Deep</L>
<L>Their Scaly heads advancing up, do peep,</L>
<L>Above the waves, displeas'd at such distresses,</L>
<L>Amaz'd, return to their unknown recesses;</L>
<L>Mean while the Combatants with clamours fill</L>
<L>Heavens cieled Arch in crying out, kill, kill.</L>
<L>Then dying groans, with shouts commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are heard,</L>
<L>And from the scoopers flowing blood appear'd.</L>
<L>Thus for some time the success doubtfull was,</L>
<L>When from the Main-top (oh! wo and alas!)</L>
<L>Some Common hand a Cursed ball did send,</L>
<L>Which brought the Noble <HI>George</HI> unto his end:</L>
<L>Fixt in his Breast, out goes his fleeting Soul,</L>
<L>Whilst in his hearts-blood, his pale Corps doth Rowl:</L>
<L>Yet e're he went to the <HI>Elizium</HI> shade,</L>
<L>To his next Friends breathing his last he said,</L>
<L><HI>God bless you all, I dye,</HI> I'me ill all o're,</L>
<L>You're <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a good Cause, play the Men therefore.</L>
<L>Stout <HI>Wiggoner</HI> the Ships chief Master fell,</L>
<L>With sundry more of whom if I should tell,</L>
<L>Too large would be the Theme, let it content</L>
<L>I'th' Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of honour, they their dear lives spent.</L>
<L>Here should I end, salt tears bids stay my Pen,</L>
<L>But Common Justice prompts me on again,</L>
<L>To speak of Valiant <HI>Condon,</HI> and his Merits,</L>
<L>Since he the Captains place duly Inherits.</L>
<L>The sword strait he advancing, doth cry out,</L>
<L>Brave Lads fight on, we'le have the other bout.</L>
<L>Your late Commander's dead <HI>(brave George)</HI> 'tis true,</L>
<L>My life against the Foe I'le spend with you;</L>
<L>Do but your parts, we'le make the <HI>Monsieur</HI> run,</L>
<L>Or Rost his hide, e're it be set of Sun.</L>
<L>Fresh Courage now revives in every breast,</L>
<L>Scorning to think of life or Interest:</L>
<L>Near one hour more they thump't the <HI>Frenchmans</HI> hide,</L>
<L>Such sort of treatment he could not abide.</L>
<L>His First, and Second in our view did fall,</L>
<L>His Ports were made as wide as door in Hall;</L>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<L>His Main-yard shot, his Men like Pidgeons fell,</L>
<L>From the Main-top; In death's Embraces dwell</L>
<L>Some hundreds more: for in our view we saw</L>
<L>From bloudy decks they their dead Men did draw.</L>
<L>But that the Poet may not Merit blame,</L>
<L>For he (as well as others) hath some shame.</L>
<L>It must not be forgot how Valiant

<L>With his ten Guns did prove a gallant spark,</L>
<L>And though desired forth with to fall astern,</L>
<L>And safe from blows himself no more concern</L>
<L>In Bloudy Combat, scorn'd to be dismay'd,</L>
<L>Hawl up the Main sail to his Men he said;</L>
<L>And from the quarter-Deck waving on high</L>
<L>His glittering sword the <HI>Frenchman</HI> did defy:</L>
<L>Come if you dare (he cry'd) we're ready for ye,</L>
<L>We'le bang your Jacket, or I should be sorry.</L>
<L>Stand by your Guns, it never shall be told</L>
<L>To my disgrace in <HI>England</HI>—New—or old</L>
<L>I fear'd a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> or would e're permit</L>
<L>My Captain to be wrong'd I feeing it:</L>
<L>Fire on his quarter, you will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach him now,</L>
<L>Place that great Gun exact against his Bough,</L>
<L>Ply well your small shot, let's do all we can,</L>
<L>What is the least, is not the worst of man.</L>
<L>Thus giving, and receiving on it goes,</L>
<L>Till the poor <HI>Monsieur</HI> thresh'd with heavy blows</L>
<L>Found he'de too much on't, strait about he wheels,</L>
<L>Finding his hands not half so good as heels.</L>
