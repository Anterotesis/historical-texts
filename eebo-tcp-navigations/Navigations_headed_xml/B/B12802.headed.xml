<P><HI>Whereas</HI> there is nothing more pleasing to God, and profitable to the Common-wealth of this Our Realme, then the training vp of youth in good and commendable Arts, Trades, Sciences, and Mysteries, whereby they may be, not onely kept from idlenesse and sloth, (the parent of all enormities) but also made apt and expert for the seruice of the Common-wealth, in the vse and practise of those Arts and misteries wherin they haue been educated and brought vp: To which end and purpose, diuers good and wholsome lawes haue beene made within this Our Realme of England; as namely, in the fift yeare of the raigne of our late deare Sister of famous memorie <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> late Queene of England, <HI>Capite quarto,</HI> a certaine Act or Statute was made, entituled, <HI>An Act touching diuers Orders for Artificers, labourers, seruants of Husbandrie, and Apprentices;</HI> Wherein it is (amongst diuers other things) enacted, that after the fift day of May then next comming, it should not be lawfull to any person or persons (other then such as then did lawfully vse or exercise any Art, Mysterie, or Manuall occupation) to set vp, occupie, vse, or exercise any Craft, Mysterie, or Occupation then vsed, or occupied within the Realme of England or Wales, except he should haue beene brought vp therein seauen yeeres at the least as an apprentice, in manner and forme as in the said Statute is expressed; nor to set any person on work in such Mystery, Art, or Occupation, being not a workman at that day, except he should haue beene apprentice, as is aforesaid, or else hauing serued as an apprentice, as is aforesaid, should or would become a Iornyman, or hired by the yeare: Vpon paine that euery such person, willingly offending or doing the contrary should forfeit and lose for euery default, Fortie shillings for euery moneth; As by the said Statute (a∣mongst diuers other things) more at large appeareth. And whereas the said Statute is of great vse and importance in this Our Realme, as well for the trayning vp of youth in the knowledge and practise of sundry good and commendable Arts Trades, Misteries, and manuall Occupations, whereby they may liue and be maintai∣ned, as otherwise for the benefit of our said Realme. And whereas through the neglect of the due execution of the said Statute, diuers and sundry persons within this our said Realme haue taken vpon them to occupie, vse, &amp; exercise sundry Arts, Mysteries Crafts, and manuall Occupations, wherein they haue not bin brought vp as apprentices by the space of seuen yeares, and haue also otherwise offended against the forme and intent of the said Statute: In which said Arts, Trades, and Mysteries, the said persons hauing now by the space of many yeares together imployed and bestowed themselues, their labours, stocks▪ and industries, haue now attained a good and perfect knowledge and vnderstanding in the same, and are become setled in a constant Trade and condition of life, whereby they are enabled com∣petently to maintaine themselues and families, which otherwise were like to perish, and fall into some idle and inordinate course of liuing, in case they should be now restrained of and from the vsing and exercising of the same, or should be punished according to the true intent &amp; meaning of the said Statute, as many of them here∣tofore h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue beene by informations and suits brought and prosecuted against them by common Informers and others, to whom they are still exposed, and lie open to be molested, sued▪ and inquieted by the like Informations and sutes. Vnlesse we out of Our Royall and Princely compassion shall prouide some meanes to relieue them in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s behalfe. <HI>Know yee</HI> therefore, that we tendring the publike good of our Realmes (which especially is procured by the due execution of good and profitable lawes) doe hereby for Vs, our Heires and Successors straightly charge, require, and command all and euery our Iudges and Iustices of both our Benches, Bar∣rons of the Exchequer, Iustices of the Peace, Maiors, Sheriffes, Bayliffes, and all and euery other Magistrates, and other Officers, for the time being, to whom it shall or may appertaine, That they and euery of them in their seuerall places respectiuely, doe take care, and from henceforth see to the due execution of the said Statute, as well touching the training vp of apprentices in commendable Arts and Misteries, (whereby they may not be suffered to liue idly and inordinately, but being therein well instituted in their apprentiships may afterwardes become profitable members and seruiceable to the Common-wealth) as in the restraining of others, (not so trained and brought vp) from the practise and exercise of any Art, Trade, or Mysterie, contrary to the said recited Statute, or any branch or clause therein contained: vnder the paines and penalties expressed in the same, which hereafter We will shalbe duely leuied and executed vpon such as shalbe found offen∣ders therein. <HI>Neuerthelesse,</HI> We being graciously pleased to extend our Royall fauour towardes such of our Subiects, as hauing heretofore taken vppon them, and are now become setled and expert in the vse and practise of Trades, Artes, Mysteries, and manuall Occupations, whereunto they haue not beene brought vp as ap∣prentices, as aforesaid, according to the forme of the said Statute, as well by <HI>pardoning</HI> their offences in that behalfe <HI>past,</HI> as also by <HI>licensing</HI> and <HI>dispensing</HI> with them for <HI>continuing</HI> the same Arts and Trades for the time to come, for and during their <HI>liues,</HI> And minding to free and acquit them for euer from those molestations, <HI>sutes</HI> and <HI>troubles</HI> which they haue been <HI>heretofore</HI> and might <HI>hereafter</HI> be put vnto by <HI>Informers,</HI> and others, by meanes of the premisses, in case they shall not imbrace our Princely grace in this behalfe. And willing that the rigor of the said Statute shall not be exacted or inflicted vpon such of our louing Subiects, as haue transgres∣sed the said Statute, and lie open and exposed to the penalties thereof, as are yet willing and desirous to take hold of and imbrace this our grace and bountie so fa∣uourably and benignely proffered them. <HI>Know yee</HI> ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore, that We of our especiall grace, certaine knowledge, and meere motion, haue ordained, authorized, na∣med, &amp; appoynted▪ and by these presents for Vs, our Heires, and Successors, doe ordaine, authorize, name, and appoint Our trustie and wel-beloued Sir <HI>Iames Spens</HI> Knight, <HI>Archibald Primrose</HI> Esquire, <HI>Henry Goldsmith</HI> Esquire, and <HI>Robert More</HI> Esquire, to be Our Commissioners for and during the terme of seuen yeeres from the date of these presents, And We doe giue vnto them the said Sir <HI>Iames Spens, Archibald Primrose, Henry Goldsmith,</HI> and <HI>Robert More,</HI> or to any two or more of them,
