<P>It is confirmed out of Poland / that the same Camp is wholly overthrowne of the Turkes / and the Tarters do greate harmes through bur∣ning and roving. Therefore A Meeting day at Marschow is kept. In like manner Bethlem Gabor doth threaten these Lands / if they make not peace.</P>
<P>The Lord of Seratin / is as a Moravish Am∣bassador arived here uppō certaine condition it is hoped that he comes to make peace / the Earle of Buequoy lieth at the Fronters of Moravia / what he will bring to passe / time will reveale.</P>

<P>After that the States of Bohemia had sat in Counsel concerning our payment / and the Earle of Mansvelt besides other artikels unto the said States / he desired <HI>12.</HI> hundred thousand Flo∣rijns / but there is profferd them <HI>800</HI> thousand Florijns / of Don Mertin / and the Cittie there uppon to be givē over to the Emperour / and be∣cause the tresuror of the Emperour is arived heer two dayes Agon / but hath not brought the fore∣said promised payment with him / therefore the Earle of Mansvelt hath commaunded all the Captaines / to make timber ready to fortify the Cittie / so thar the accord is wholy broken again.</P>
<P>This Cittie is strongly fortyfied / and is dayly made stronger / and hier stand <HI>13</HI> very faire pee∣ces of ordnaunce / and here is as yet noe want of provision / in the meane while these Souldiers run dayly out / bring in greate store of cattle / so that a Cowe is soulde for halfe a floryne / and an Sheepe for <HI>12</HI> Krijtsers.</P>
<P>The Earle of Mantsvelt shoulde goe to Sa∣voy / and doth cause his Bagadge to be sent to Amberghe alreddy / and seeing that certaine en∣couradgements are com from Amberge hither / that the Earle Sigmont of Brandenburg is exspected dayly to com hether / with <HI>500</HI> thousād Florijns for the Earle of Mantsvelt and for pay¦ment of the Souldiers.</P>
<P>Who begin to be encouradged thereby: after the arrivement of the foresaid / the Earle of Mantsvelt shal goe forward on his iourney and the said Earle of Brādenburg besides the Earle of Leeuwensteen shal be made General.
