<P>And His Majesty doth hereby require the principal Officers and Commissioners of His Navy, Governours of His Forts and Castles, the Officers of His Customs, and Commanders or Officers of any of His Majesties Ships, or upon their meéting with or otherwise observing any Merchants Ships or Vessels of His Majesties Subjects wearing such a Flag, Iack, or Ensign contrary hereunto, whether at Sea, or in Port, not onely to cause such Flag, Iack, or Ensign to be forthwith Seised, but to Return the Names of the said Ships and Vessels, together with the Names of their respective Masters, unto the Lord High Admiral, Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, or the Iudge of the High Court of Admiralty for the time being, to the end the persons offending may be duly Pu∣nished for the same.</P>
<P>And His Majesty doth hereby Command and Enjoyn the Iudge and Iudges of the High Court of Admiralty for the time being, that at the several Sessions to be hereafter held by His Majesties Commission of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer</HI> for the Admiralty, they give in Charge, that strict enquiry be made of all Offences in the Premisses, and that they cause all offenders therein to be duly punished: And all Vice-Admirals, and Iudges of Vice-Admiralties, are also to do the same, and to attend the due observation hereof within the several Ports and Places of their respective Precincts.</P>
