<P>In this Countrey the Silesian soldiours haue a good time, are secure, haue what they will, take whatsoeuer they can get against mens wills, consume the Country and the Townes, and yet will be paid at the full. Which is a speciall punishment of God layd vpon this Countrey.</P>

<HEAD>From Chur in Zwitzerland the 30. of August. 1621.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Madalon</HI> the extraordinary French Ambassador, had made promise to the leaguers, to shew them his Commis∣sion from the King vpon the <HI>31.</HI> of this month, yet pro∣longed it off <HI>8</HI> dayes more, and then assured them with∣out further delay to shew it vnto them, Which they will hardly trust, considering that the enemy, the longer the more time had to strengthen himselfe. As vpon the <HI>25.</HI> of this month, there came <HI>30.</HI> Companies of Spaniards, &amp; <HI>18.</HI> Companies of Neopolitanes from Millain, and that dayly <HI>30.</HI> Drums still sounded to take vp Soldiers, which is to late in the yeare to send to the Emperor, and there∣fore those Soldiers should be imployed in the places nea∣rest there abouts. Therefore they made him answere, if that after the said <HI>8.</HI> dayes respite so required, he should séeke for a longer prologation, that without further speaking vnto him, they wold giue him the contract back againe, and would procéed with their resolution. Where∣upon y<SUP>e</SUP> said Ambssador hath distributed <HI>26000.</HI> francks pension, and the people of the there Bunten are so well pacified and agrée together, as in <HI>17.</HI> yeares before they neuer were more.

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Vien the 18. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>From the fronters of Caniseche, there is newes, that the Budiane with ayde from the Turke hath taken the Fort of Kementh againe, and is determined also to take the Towne and Castle of Gius againe, and doth great hurt and damage by ransacking &amp; burning, without resi∣stance about Newstadt, and it is feared that they wil at∣tempt somthing vpon the suburbs. There are many poor people that goe here abouts to beg, And to conclude, the necesity and misery is so great here amongst our people, as also among the enemies where they lye, that it is vn∣speakable, and the Gretzer way or passage is so dange∣rous, that no man dares looke abroad.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Vienna the 9. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> is now at Schindow, where he staies for <HI>20000.</HI> Turkes to come vnto him, the Marquis of Iagerensdorp is with his Dutch forces, &amp; ten Thousand Hungarians gone ouer Wittenbergh to Morauia, also the Budianer, the longer doth the more great hurt, to whom the Bassa of Natolia with <HI>12000.</HI> Turks is com∣ming to ayd him.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Prague the 9. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>There is no newes here, this day the <HI>2.</HI> Companies of Ritters haue receiued a month &amp; a halfe pay, and are this day gone towards Morauia, because it is feared that the Hungarians, will enter into it againe, and it is not certainly knowne, whether <HI>Don Balthasar</HI> hath left his siege before Tabor or not.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Spiers the 14. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>Last Friday, Generall <HI>Veere</HI> sent a Trumpet to the Bishop of Spiers, with a Letter to this effect, that foras∣much as <HI>don Cordoua</HI> was entred further into the Pa∣latinate, and had taken the Castle of Stein, and had vsed great tyrannie against the Subiects, and Church∣men, and that he was certified, that he had bin the motio∣ner thereof, and moued <HI>Don Cordoua</HI> thereunto, as also that he had holpen to maintain the Bauarian army with mony, be thought good to aduertise the said Bishop, not onely to forbeare sending mony to the Catholike league, as also without delay specially to send the Spaniards a∣gaine out of his Territories, and if not, hée would deale in like manner with the Country and people, specially with the Priests, as <HI>Don Cordona</HI> hath done in the Pa∣latinats, which is a matter to bréed war. Whereupon the Bishop sent a friendly answer &amp; excuse, in this manner; that although he were by the said General estéemed to be an enemy, &amp; that by him his poore Subiects in the Market were ransackt and spoyl'd, yet it was no furtherance nor good vnto him to haue the innocent poore people in the Pa∣latinate, for a reuenge thereof to be assayled, whereunto he said, that he neither gaue counsell nor was any fur∣therer vnto the same, and much lesse had meanes to di∣uert the Spanish soldiers.</P>
<P>The vniuersall defence shall be taken in hand, &amp; with all spéed put in effect, to the which end, the Duke of Lo∣rains ambassador is now with the Bishop at Odenheim, and to that end there are Letters of aduise sent to the neighbour Townes and States.</P>

<P>In the Palatinate, euery one be he rich or poore, frée or not, within <HI>3.</HI> monthes must pay <HI>18.</HI> Florins for the pay∣ment of the Soldiers, but it is said that the Townes will not pay it, before they haue their Lord.</P>
<P>The Ship bridge made by the Spaniards by Stein, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="2"/>ready, and yesterday Wattenheim was burnt by the Spaniards. They of the Palatinate to the contrary lye still, it is thought the Spaniards now with their whole forces, will ouerrun all Bergstrate, and run almost to the gates of Heidelbergh, and it is to be feared (if no ayde comes) that all the lower Palatinate will be lost, for that there are no more but <HI>3.</HI> Townes to be wonne in it, <HI>viz.</HI> Heydelbergh, Franckendall and Manheim.</P>
<P>They of Bensheim in Bergstraet haue sought for helpe of other Townes, which is promised them, and the said Towne hath taken the keyes from the Soldiers, and will assure the Towne themselues.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">

<P>Touching the besieging of Gulicke, there is nothing to the purpose done, onely that the Spaniards begin to make <HI>3.</HI> Bulwarkes before it, <HI>2.</HI> of them being almost ready, but yet so farre from the towne, that they séeme to be made rather for the defence of their Army, and a let∣ting of the Garrison from issuing out vpon them, then o∣uercome the towne, so that it is thought that the said towne shall onely be Bulwarked about.</P>
<P>Letters from Brigges certifie, that there past at least <HI>12000,</HI> selected Soldiers, horse and footemen, by that towne: with all kind of preparation, as Scopes, Spades Baskets, Scuts, &amp;c. Men supposing here, that they will doe some wondrous thing.</P>
