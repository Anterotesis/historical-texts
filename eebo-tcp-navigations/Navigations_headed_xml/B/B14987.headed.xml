<P>The Lord Charles van Sherin remayneth yet heere / that hath denounced unto his Majestie in the name of the Moravish States / that first they should have a safe conduct. Secondly / a ge∣neral pardon and remission. Thirdly / that into their Countrey there should not be brought men of warre. For this they offer and have presented to receive his Majestie / whereupon this resolu∣tion is taken: that notwithstanding they first where not worthy / neverthelesse it should be graunted unto them / if they should shew them∣selves obedient / those that have beene cause / his Majestie will not pardon / but shall be punished to an exampel of others. The men of warre should be brought into the Countrey / but none should suffer damage / but those that should withstand. Whereupon some of the States and Communs have declared themselves / but others would not trust to it / and are departed till a sure pardon be given / and therefore the whole armey is lying in Moravia / to consirayne the rebelles to obedience / and march to Brin / but some saye that <HI>15</HI> thousand men of warre expect them the∣re. Likewise at Spalits / Olmits and other pla∣ces are some thousands / that are resolved to withstande the Emperour looking yet for many <HI>1000.</HI> to do a great expedition.</P>

<P>They saye yet that Moravia should be delive∣red to the Maiestie / but with certaine conditions but his Maiestie will not accept them / but with condition of grace and disgrace / whereupon they have sent hither Ambassadours to further pro∣ceedings / but they are taken by the waye of the Hungarians and some of them are slaine / not∣withstanding they shewed Patent Letters of the Emperour / whereupon answer is given unto them / that they where arrant knaves / they have therefore written hither / that they can not come / and they meane that the Morabians with this handling seeke but to winne time / and that Bet∣lem hath assisted them with <HI>5000</HI> men.</P>
<P>The Earle of Bucquoy is yet at Iglou / and the Armey of the Emperour at the siege of a strong Castle not far from Brin.</P>
<P>His Maiestie hath revoked againe the required Capital censure.</P>
<P>This Land-daye heere goeth yet forward / and his Maiestie hath sent a strong Decretum to the Earle Iohn Sigismund of Altensheym / that within the end of this moneth of December he should set af all the Lutherian Officers / and substitute Catholike in stead of them. The like should be done in the Salt-ministery / and the Book-keēping.</P>
<P>After the Holy dayes the Frenche Ambassa∣dour is minded to take his journey to Bethlem Gabor / to make with the same an agreement / but his Maiestie should have answered / that he would neyther consent to it / nor keepe it bak∣ward / but hee might do his pleasure / his Maie∣stie had meanes to compel the Hungarians to obedience.</P>

<P>Heere is advised / that the departed King of Bohemia should marche againe to Bohemia and Saxonie / with a great number of Hungarians and other Nations / with some Turks and Tar∣tarians.</P>
<P>The Moravians marche strongly against the Emperours Folkes / and notwithstanding that the same have taken Zuaim / they hope to recover it / because the Kinge with the Hungarians are making them strong.</P>
<P>The newes continueth / that the Emperours Folke by Tuglau are slaine of the Moravians.</P>
<P>The Duke of Bavaria hath sent already heere a Politicq Ordinance / which perhaps in this Countreys shall speedly be published / and the matter is in such state that the Countrey of the Ens for many yeares shall be conscribed / which shall cause a great altration / and as they saye the States and Communes desire of the Empe∣rour to receave the Inauguration / and resolu∣tion should be followed / that the said four States should consent the petition / that the Duke of Bavaria had requested in ready money. And that the Auguration then could be furthered / and because that same amounts to a great somme of money / concerning the pretension of the Duke / and that it is impossible that the States should furnish so much / therefore against our will we shall be constrained to remaine Bavarish / which is not liked of many Lords.</P>

<P>Som few dayes past the Folke of the Empe∣rour have been at Tabor / purposing to take it in with an assault / but are driven of with the losse of <HI>500.</HI> men. And therefore hath Monsieur Tilly written for more assistannce of men.</P>
<P>The Smarackes or commun people heere spe∣cially in the new Cittie / have been som few dayes past very seditious / because the Garrison did not cease of saccaging / and they have slaine above <HI>100.</HI> and did beginne themselves to saccadge / so that the Generals and others had enough to do to pacifye them.</P>

<P>Vpon this Land-daye is concluded / in the presence of the Ambassadours of Denmarke / Sweden and Hungaria / and the confederated Princes / to keep in the fields for the King <HI>16000</HI> men / and to constitute a new general / and to live and dye in this Confederation / whereupon the King should be in his journey to Brin with <HI>16000</HI> men / and the Earle of Thurne should be∣have him very wel in Morabia / and not be arre∣sted as the speech went.</P>

<P>The Earle of Thurne was returned with new ayde from Hungaria into Moravia with declaration and resolution that Bethlem Gabor King of Hungaria / notwithstanding the great losse / would assiste his Maiestie of Bohemia with all his power / and never forsake the Con∣federation. Yea the Hungarians saye openly / that before they should submitte themselves to the House of Austria / they would rather take helpe of the Turke.</P>
<P>The Emperour should have manifestly decla∣red / that he hath given commission to the Mar∣quis Spinola / to make himselfe Maister of the whole Palts.</P>
<P>Both by the Emperour and Vnited Princes is great need of money / Spinola having occu∣pied and taken the principal Customes / requi∣ring upon penalty of burning so great chardges of money / that the meorporated Lands are not able to bring them up.</P>
<P>The Coronell Gray is finally with his men arrived in the Over Palts / where he shall re∣mayne unto neerer commaundement.</P>
</DIV2>

<P>From Coppenhaghen is written / that there was arrived the Sonne of Duke Hans from Sonderberch / Kinsman or Couzen Germaine of his Maiestie of Dennemarke / as Ambassa∣dour of his Maiestie of Bohemia / is lodged upon the Castle / and should further take his Iourney to his Maieestie of Dennemarke at Frederich∣bergh / his commission and petition is un∣knowne.</P>
<P>The Nuptial Feast of his Maiestie of Swe∣den / and the Koronation of the Queen is ended with good succes / it seemes that his Maiestie of Sweden is resolved to ondertake some thing against the Poole / and hath already at Stock∣holme <HI>15000</HI> Footmen in readines.</P>
<P>Letters from Paris declare / that the Mari∣schal Cadinet with a great suite is departed to his Maiestie of great Brittayne.</P>
<P>The Religious matters in Fraunce are yet of a strange showe / they hope neverthelesse that his Maiestie will direct all to the best / giving con∣tentement to them of the Religion.</P>
<P>The Lord of Bossampiere doth not depart to Spaine from the Kings part / to restitution of the Deltolines / before the Helvetians Cantons amongst them / and they with the Grisons shall be agreed and united.</P>
