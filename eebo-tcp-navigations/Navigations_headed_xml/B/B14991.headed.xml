<HEAD>THE POST OF THE PRINCE, which advises vs, the taking of <HI>Steen-Bergh,</HI> and the besieging of <HI>Berghen vp Zoom.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Ome few dayes agoe the Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> sent certaine Compa∣nies towards <HI>Mastricht</HI> to crosse there the Ri∣ver of the <HI>Maye,</HI> as if they shoulde haue marcht towards the <HI>Rhine,</HI> keeping never∣thelesse the greatest parts of his forces in <HI>Brabant,</HI> as if they were to follow the other but that was not his intent.</P>
<P>Satterday, Sunday, and Munday, there was given order to goe towards <HI>Maeseyck,</HI> onely to deceiue the forces of the <HI>States.</HI></P>
<P>The rest past by <HI>Brey,</HI> and <HI>Peer,</HI> where∣upon followed the Garrisons of <HI>Bilzen, Hasselt, Herck, Hall, Diest, Sichenen, Arschot, Lo∣ven,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>Beringen,</HI> and <HI>Geell</HI> to the <HI>Hooghe-Straets,</HI> where those of <HI>Liere, Mechesten,</HI> and <HI>Antwerpe</HI> met likewise, which all ioyned, made a great Armie, and was provided with Ar∣tillery, Gun-powder, Leade, and certaine Boates vpon Waggons with all necessarie provisions, for an enterprise In the meane time the <HI>Marquis</HI> with some few horse po∣sted to <HI>Wesell,</HI> as if hee would haue ioyned with Count <HI>Henry</HI> of the <HI>Bergh,</HI> but hee re∣turned presently.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orenge</HI> vnderstanding this gaue command that the <HI>States</HI> horse in <HI>Bra∣bant,</HI> should ride to <HI>Bommelerwaert,</HI> and <HI>Nim∣wegen,</HI> little thinking what was the scope of the enemies. Wherupon certaine troops of horse of the Garrison of <HI>Berghen vp zoom,</HI> being arrived at <HI>Breda, Iustinus</HI> of <HI>Nassaw</HI> Go∣vernour of <HI>Breda,</HI> having had some intelli∣gence of the desseing of <HI>Spinola,</HI> perswaded them to returne backe, and told them that he was sure that <HI>Spinola</HI> had an enterprise vpon <HI>Berghen vp Zoom.</HI></P>
<P>The Leaders after a little deliberation, con∣descended all presently to his advise, not∣withstanding the command of the Prince
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>of <HI>Orange.</HI> As soone as they were return'd in their Garrison, they vnderstood, that the Spanish Forces, twelue thousand strong, marched towards the Castle of <HI>Wowe:</HI> And vpon the 18. of Iuly, these of <HI>Steen berghen</HI> perceived that their Towne was to be besieged, being vnawares, and vnprovided of many things necessary to sustaine a siege, seeing it is a place of no great importance. Monsieur <HI>Borwater</HI> Go∣vernour of the place, being a braue Souldi∣er, was much discontented with this Newes, seeing he wanted both men and Munition, having but one peece of Ordi∣nance in the Towne, and that vnservicea∣ble, layd before the Hospitall without the appurtenances. It is certaine, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> few dayes before the siege, sent thether a Gunner, and had given charge to a Commissioner to convay thether fiue or six Cannons, but whatsoever the cause is, it was not performed: And the Women of the Towne much discontented with the sayd Commissioner, would haue cast him the aforesayd Munday (being the 18. of Iuly) into the water; the said day about
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>noone is the enemy come so neere to the Towne, that their voyces might be heard by the Garrison, and turn'd presently their Ordinance, and discharged the same a∣gainst the Towne, not having made any Battery.</P>
<P>And having made a reasonable bigge breach in the walles with sixtie Cannon shot, the Inhabitants began to looke hea∣vie, the rather because they had not heard of late the noyse of such Heath Crickets. A few houres before, went a great number of women and children, crying and lamen∣ting, out of the Towne; which was cer∣tainely a pittifull spectacle to beholde.</P>
<P>What concernes the cryes and laments heard by me, as well of those that were within as without <HI>Tertolen,</HI> the <HI>C'limder</HI> and the <HI>Plaet.</HI> I will not speake of, they carry away all what they will not loose.</P>
<P>I could more liuely Relate how they cry and lament, and wring their hands toge∣ther, the one, for her husband, the other, for her childe, leaping in and out the boats (saying) that they will remayne, where flesh and bloud is lost, goods are not re∣membered
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>in such cases. In those places where these things happen, there is no disputing whether they be Papists, Protestants, or Armi∣nians, but must ioyntly resist the invasion of the enemies.</P>
<P>On thursday the 19. of Iuly did the enemies send a Trumpet to the Towne, to aske whe∣ther they would Parley. That otherwise, his Forces standing readie in Battell array, should assault the towne where the breach was made. Declaring moreover, that they would not de∣part from thence before they had brought the Towne vnder the obedience of the King of <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>The valiant Governour <HI>Borwater,</HI> with two Captaines, and the Gentlemen of their Com∣panies, and some of the Magistrats of the place, resolved to keepe the Towne, vntill the last man, for the <HI>States.</HI> But they requested the Trumpet, that he would try whether the ene∣mies would condescend to a cessation of Armes for few houres onely; wherevpon, he returned presently to <HI>Don Lewis de V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yco,</HI> and the Governour of <HI>Antwerpe.</HI></P>
<P>In the meane time, they sent some to looke whether they could not see (standing vpon the Steeple) any Shippes comming with ayde.
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>But afterwards, seeing that the enemy divided his Forces in three severall Troopes, to assault the towne in divers places, and that they were not able to defend the same, seeing it had no Countrescarps, or Bulwarkes, but onely cer∣taine round Towers of no strength. And like∣wise in consideration of the lamentations of women and Cittizens which had any thing to loose, they could not resolue almost what to doe. And to speake the truth, there was no o∣ther issue to be expected, then that the Souldi∣ers, and armed Cittizens, should be slaine, as also all the rest, and all their goods pillaged, and made havock off.</P>
<P>At the same instant, the Trumpet being re∣turned, told them that the enemy would not grant them as much as the space of an houre. But if they would surrender the Towne, they should haue good conditions, and be well v∣sed, otherwise they must doe as the cause should require.</P>
<P>The Governour was vnwilling to yeeld, but most Voyces carryed away, and agreed vpon these following Conditions and Articles.</P>
<P N="1">1. That all the Souldiers with their Armes and Armour, besides Baggage should depart, and be conducted with a safe Convoy.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<P N="2">2. That the Townesmen should pay two thousand Gilders (which is 200.<SUP>li.</SUP> Sterling) to the Souldiers, to hinder their pillaging.</P>
<P N="3">3. That all the Townesmen after the afore∣said money is payd, shall haue libertie to de∣part with their goods where they list.</P>
<P N="4">4. That those that would remaine there, and liue according to their Lawes, Customes, and Ceremonies, they might, and should be vsed as other Inhabitants of the obeysant Citties and Townes of <HI>Brabant.</HI></P>
<P>Vpon these conditions is the Towne surren∣dered the aforesaid Munday before noone be∣ing the 19. of Iuly. The Governour had like∣wise leaue to convay his goods away. Within the Towne were two Companies, an old and a new, both of <HI>Alekmar,</HI> &amp; behaved themselues very valiantly.</P>
<P>At their departure there was a woman that philipping vpon her thumbe, told to some of the Souldiers, now you must foorth and our friends shall come in.</P>
<P>This Towne was beset with 9. Companies, and one Captaine <HI>Det</HI> (who did lie in former time vpon the Castle of <HI>Wowe,</HI> and is very skil∣full in pillaging, wherefore the Countrey peo∣of the <HI>Climder, Stryen,</HI> and the <HI>Plaet</HI> may looke to
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>themselues, seing at the Land side he hath but a barren Heath) made Governour of the same.</P>
<P>At the Haven not farre from the Towne, is the Enemie raysing a Fort compelling both Cittizens and Souldiers to labour at it.</P>
<P>They haue likewise put their boats to the water, which they haue gotten thither by wag gons, intending to trouble the Navigation be∣twixt <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Sealand.</HI> But our Mariners and Saylers wilbe very glad to meete with them.</P>
<P>As soone as the enemy had his garrison plan∣ted in the Towne, he sent his forces towards <HI>Berghen vp Zoom,</HI> but 2. Leagues from thence, the horse were conducted by <HI>Don Lewis de Velas∣co,</HI> and the foote by the Governour of <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> marching so in all hast to the sayd Citty, and being arrived there, planted their Ordinance not farre off, thinking to speede as they did at <HI>Steene-berghen,</HI> having notice that the Horse in garrison were abroad.</P>
<P>And towards the Evening they thought to surprise the horne-workes, or the great out∣workes neere Saint <HI>Quirin;</HI> But the Governour <HI>Rhyhoven</HI> did hid himselfe in the sayd outworks commanding the Ordinance and all things ne∣cessary to bee made readie against their ap∣proach. which being perceived, the Ordinance
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>was presently displayd against them, and our foote went to meete them, crying, kill, kill, kil, and after the sound of the Trumpet, our horse likewise set vpon the Enemies, pursuing them in such maner vnto their Cannon, that a great slaughter was made amongst them, and if the garrison had beene well seconded and refresh∣ed, they would haue carried it away, or other∣wise nayled the same to make it vnserviseable: at our retreat the horse of the enemy prepared themselues to set vpon our garrison, but our Ordinance planted vpon the wals, caused both men and horses to cut capers in the ayre wher∣by there rose such an Alarum with crying and lamenting amongst them, that it seemed that every one was hurt that came neere, them. In such maner they haue beene twise or thrise re∣sconcerned, and if they like it well they may come againe</P>
<P>But they disliking much this danse, retyred presently a quarter of a myle, they tooke their men which were slaine along with them and rancked them in the sand, saying these feare no more the <HI>Flamencos.</HI> In the meane time those of the city spare no charges to fortifie themselues, having pierced likewise the Beare of the newe worke neare the Haven.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> as soone as he was in∣formed of these passages, sent thither on Thurs∣day the valiāt Collonel the Lord of <HI>Fama</HI> with a 100. smal ships loaden with armed souldIers, The next day, the Count <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> sayled likewise with 100. small Ships to the sayd City, besides these, there are many ships and men ar∣rived from <HI>Zealand,</HI> in such maner that the wa∣ter seemed to be covered with Shippes and Boats.</P>
<P>Out of his Campe he dispatcht likewise cer∣taine troops of horse (which tooke their way by <HI>Huesden, Gertruyen, Bergh, Oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terhrut,</HI> and <HI>Breda</HI>) to endamage the Enemy before <HI>Berghen</HI> afore∣sayd. To day we are advised that there be a∣boue 5000. souldiers in <HI>Berghen vp Zoom,</HI> &amp; that the Enemy hath lost 400.</P>
<P>The 19. of <HI>Iuly,</HI> there was brought in a Prise at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> with 800. Chests of Sugar.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The taking in of the Towne of <HI>Goch,</HI> in the land of Cleue, <HI>by the Marquis</HI> SPINOLA.</HEAD>
<P>ANno 1622. the 26.27. and 28. of <HI>Iuly,</HI> is the Mar∣quis <HI>Spinola</HI> accompanied with Count <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> of the <HI>Bergh,</HI> and some Forces, marcht from <HI>Wezell</HI> towards the East side of the <HI>Rhine</HI> down∣ward,
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>as if he would haue attempted some∣thing against <HI>Doesburgh, Zutphen,</HI> or <HI>Deventer.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> well knowing his Stra∣tagems, lookt about as well as he could. But <HI>Spinola</HI> having chosen a fit time for himselfe, stayed all Passengers at that instant, and drew instantly out of the next Citties and Townes of <HI>Cleue,</HI> a good part of the Garrisons with him, and set with the same vpon <HI>Goch.</HI> And having with his Ordinance beaten the Tyles from the houses, so that they fell in the Street, which causing the Townesmen to run more to their Cellers then Walls, he got the Towne by com∣position the 28. of <HI>Iuly,</HI> seeing the Garrison was but 300 men strong, and not able to resist with their willing hearts, his violences and Forces.</P>
<P>From <HI>Rome,</HI> Last Sunday the Post (that was sent by the Arch-Duke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> vnto the Pope requesting his Holinesse that whereas he had certaine Souldiers in pay in <HI>Germany,</HI> vnder the Commaund of <HI>Don Pedro Alderbrandino,</HI> it would please him to turne them over into his service) hath beene dispacht with this answere, that the Arch-Duke must sue for the same purpose vnto the Emperour.</P>
<P>Last Wednesday, the Ambassadour of the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> did present a horse, and a Letter
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>of Exchange of 7000. Crownes for the feude or fealtie of the Kingdome of <HI>Naples,</HI> which were accepted by the Procurator of the Exche∣quer; with the accustomed &amp; vsual protestatiō.</P>
<P>We heare from <HI>Naples,</HI> that the Galleons with Souldiers lately sayled towards <HI>Spaine</HI> are to be imployed against the Pirates: And that out of the sayd Kingdomes 400000. Crownes, and from <HI>Sicilia</HI> 150000. Crownes should be made over by Letters of Exchange in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> towards the charges of the warre.</P>
<P>From <HI>Messina,</HI> they write that the Gallies of <HI>Tosca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> were arrived at <HI>Reggio,</HI> having fought with 15. Vessels of the Pyrats, and had made 250. of them slaues, and gotten 8. peeces of Or∣dinance from them, and one Ship loaden with Oyle, besides 100000. Crownes for acompo∣sition or ransome to saue their liues.</P>
<P>From <HI>Venice,</HI> Iuly 8. from <HI>Turine</HI> they advise that the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> rayseth many forces in <HI>France,</HI> and other countries, having sent divers Inginers to fortifie his Fortresses of <HI>Asti, Vercelli,</HI> and Saint <HI>Germane</HI> and other places. Morco∣ver he hath supplied the garrisons of <HI>Asti,</HI> and <HI>Vercelli,</HI> with 400. Souldiers. And that <HI>Aldeibgera</HI> hath an army in readines vpon the confines of <HI>Savoy,</HI> for his Highnes service.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>
<P>Letters from <HI>Milane</HI> relate, that 100. cartes from thence were sent with munition to the <HI>Veltolinas</HI> to prouide the souldiers withall, seeing that great forces are to be sent thether against the Grisons. Thesouldiers which came with the Knight <HI>Plecch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> from Alsatia are sent towards <HI>Bormio.</HI> The Spaniards which haue layne in <HI>Cleue</HI> are marcht vp to∣wards <HI>Millane,</HI> hauing left there onely the Counte <HI>Serbellione</HI> with his regiment. And heere are leauied with all speed 11. trouppes of horse.</P>
<P>Last Thusday is the Knight <HI>Simon Conta∣rini</HI> chosen by this <HI>Signorie</HI> Ambassador for <HI>Constantinopele</HI> to congratulate the great <HI>Signor,</HI> who hath giuen two millons of gold to his Ianissaries, and increased their pension 3. aspers a day.</P>
<P>From <HI>Brinoten</HI> the 10. daie the Confede∣rates haue besieged <HI>Guttenborg</HI> and discharge their ordinance against the same, doeing those of the Towne the like: besides they haue made a sconse neere <HI>Vleschenberg</HI> direct∣ly against the Towne to endammage the same, as likewise inuaded <HI>Mantasan,</HI> and as∣saulted
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>the enemies in two assunder places, which causeth great feare &amp; dearth in <HI>Tirol.</HI></P>
<P>The Confederates at <HI>Baden</HI> haue vnder hand &amp; seale reniewed their confederation with the <HI>Graubuntens,</HI> whereupon they care now litle for <HI>Leopoldus</HI> and other enemies. Likewise the 5. Catholike Cantons haue pro∣mised free passage to the Reformed, vpon condition that they shal bring certificates or passeports from their Magistrates or Com∣manders. And they themselfes haue aduised the Protestantes to make no agreement with their enemies, but to go on with their enter∣prises, &amp; to clense the countrie quit of them. When they haue taken <HI>Engadin,</HI> they inten∣ded to besiege <HI>Veltkercken;</HI> they get daily great assistance of men, munition, &amp; ordinance, from the Bunoters.</P>
<P>From <HI>Prague</HI> the 12. of Iuly. The 7. of this moneth is the Count of <HI>Hoghensoller</HI> (being Ambass<SUP>er</SUP>. of the Emp.) trauelled towards Dresden vnto the Duke &amp; Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI>) and to other places of the Empire.</P>
<P>Yesterday the Commissioners went al this Citie ouer, to visit the armes of the Prote∣stants,
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>and left them only their rapers &amp; dag∣gers, after they had inrolled them in their bookes, to what purpose, we hnow not yet.</P>
<P>From <HI>Frankendall</HI> the 12. day Counte <HI>Mans∣field</HI> &amp; Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Brunswick</HI> are marcht towards Luthenborch with an armie of 1100. horse and 25000. foote: and taking euerie where great contributions, and wee heare that they haue gotten 300000. Ryxdallers in <HI>Alsatia</HI> onely: and we looke what both the Imperiall armies will attempt. It is thought that they will passe ouer at <HI>Shrock</HI> and march from thence to <HI>Newstadt</HI> and <HI>Germersheim.</HI></P>
<P>All the forces by the Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> left in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> lie in garrison, the horse onely excepted of <HI>Obertrout</HI> and <HI>Meganck</HI> which keepe about the Mountain. There is a strong garrison in this Towne, being two trouppes of horse amongst them, we are likewise very well prouided with all kinde of ordinance.</P>
<P>The Fort commenced by the Schaperie of this Town is made alreadie defensible, and the workemen continue daily to worke at it. They say here that our Prince is gone towards <HI>Sedan,</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Boullion</HI> keepes his Court.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
<P>From <HI>Francfort</HI> the 21. Iulij, It is certaine that the Imperialists are retired from Heydel∣bergh. The English Ambassador laboureth hard to obtaine a truce, or a cessatiō of armes.</P>
<P>Here is rumored that the Spanish forces wil laie an other bridge at Stein to passe ouer the Rhine. The meane time are the Spanish &amp; Bauarian forces at <HI>Worms</HI> transported ouer the Rhyne with boates, but their baggage shalbe carried ouer the bridge at <HI>Vppenheim;</HI> and is like they will besidge <HI>Franckendall.</HI></P>
<P>The Counte of <HI>Anboult</HI> marching with his forces toward <HI>Alsatia</HI> did seiourn 3. daies agoe at <HI>Kerken</HI> two leagues but distant from <HI>Tourlach,</HI> what his intentiō is we know not:</P>
<P>The Landtgraue <HI>Lodewick of Darmstad</HI> is retired vpon his fort <HI>Russesheim,</HI> where he in∣tends to abide for a time. Otherwise wee heare but litle of the souldiers, but that they sometime with halfe Companies goe pillad∣ging, and in such manner was lately ransackt and pillaged the Castle of <HI>Offenback</HI> belon∣ging to the Counte of <HI>Isenburgh.</HI></P>
