<HEAD>PROPOSALS Of the Undertakers for setling a Free Port in WEST-INDIA.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas many and great Advantages have been Reapt by most Nations of Europ, from and by the disco∣very of that Rich and spatious Country <HI>West-India,</HI> and yet many Rich and valuable Discoverys both of profit and place in the same, convenient for setlement are hither∣to unknown and unposest by Europeans.</P>
<P>Which the Undertakers having been conversant in these parts, are ready to demonstrate when occasion requires with the advantages, that will acrue to all who shall be willing to adven∣ture therein, either in person or purse.</P>
<P>And for the publick and universal Improvement of the said Advantages in this and time to come, the Undertakers intend to manage the same by a Society to be called and known by the name of the general European Company for <HI>West-India.</HI></P>
<P>And for the more free and easie management of this great and good undertaking, the Company do declare, that they will setle a free Port and Trade upon some convenient place in the said Countries, for the Seat of Commerce between that and Europe, as well as other parts of the World.</P>
<P>And since every man ought to be informed of the particular Advantages, before Adventure be made, none are obliged to subscribe any sum upon their Admission into this Company, but the terms of such Admission shall only be subscribing to the Conditions upon the Roll here underwritten.</P>
<P>And he who is admitted in manner aforesaid, shall ever after by himself, or Deputy, be duely informed of all the succeeding undertakings, and have vot and share in the same suteable to
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>his Adventure, which is not to exceed ten thousand Gilders in principale stock for any one man at any time for the first three years.</P>
<P>And the same Company do resolve from time to time, to de∣fray all and every part of the Charge of their several underta∣kings by their joynt consent and common stocke.</P>
<P>And as it may be necessary for the said Society in time to come in some particular undertakings to make their Applica∣tion to the High and Mighty States, and other Governments of Europe, as well as particular persons, so this as all other things, shall be done, as need require, by advise of the Company, and Charge of the Common stock.</P>
<P>The Company think fit at present only to give this general account of things and publick Invitation for persons to subscribe reserving the secrets of Trade, and the Company to the assem∣bly, or such as they shall order from time to time.</P>
<P>Those that are willing to enter into this Society, but would conceal their names for a time, may enter, or cause to be enterd what other name they please, and take a note from the Steward, to signify, that such name is only in trust for him provided, al∣way that such notes of Trust shall be produced, and the right Names enterd when the Assembly shall please to order it, least by such means one, or a few persons under several names should engrose to themselves too great an interest in this undertaking.</P>
<P>The Members who have already subscribed, have chosen and appointed <HI>Rest Fenner,</HI> Bookseller, near the Exchange in Amsterdam, being one of the Company, the present Steward to keep the Rolle, and take Subscriptions until the meeting of the Assembly.</P>
<P>All the persons who live at a distance from Amsterdam, may send their Order in writting to any Friend, to doe it for them; but such Orders must be filled up for the warrant of every one who subscribes for his Friend; and such Resolutions of the Company as are needful to be made publick, shall be given in the Courants or by other publick Notice from time to time.</P>
<P>The Underwritten is the Copy of the Rolle for Subscrip∣tion.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<P>Whereas the Freedom and Liberty of the Worship of God, according to the holy Scriptures, is the first and most desirable thing, and in the next place the Security of the Liberty, and property of the persons and Estates of every man to him and his posterity so far as humane prudence can extend it self for the common good of mankind ought to be preserved; Wee therefore doe resolve and agree by Gods permission to setle a free Port and Trade for all Nations in an Eminent part of <HI>West-India,</HI> whereunto we are invited by a great and populous Em∣pire, where we shall not only by the Divine Assistance be capable of promoting the true Worship of God, but also of enriching our selves, and all that shall be concerned with us, and therefore We propose to our own and all other Christian Na∣tions, who are desirous to joyn in so glorious and great an un∣dertaking to incorporate with us; resolving to give and allow equal Priviledges and Advantages to all, according to their Merits. And because so great an undertaking cannot be ef∣fectually carried on without the concurrence of many persons of ability and Substance, We do resolve and agree that when we have received the Subscriptions of Seventy persons to this undertaking, a general meeting shall be appointed and held, where the whole Affair shall then be debated, and such Officers, both Military and Civil as may seem convenient, shall be setled with the methods for effecting this great glorious and advanta∣geous Affair, which we question not but God that hath inspired us in the undertaking, will bless and prosper to the accom∣plishing thereof; but in regard all things are intended to be managed by a Comon Stock, and the Advantages destributed according to the Quantum of every persons subscription, which cannot be brought to the desired perfection, without some present Charge. It is therefore agreed that every Sub∣criber shall deposite the sum of twenty Gilders upon his Sub∣scription, to be imployed for and towards the necessary charge of the promoting and obtaining the Subscriptions, and meeting of the said Assembly of Seventy, to whom affair and just Ac∣count shall be given at their meeting, and then the Remain∣der of that Money and all such Sums as shall then and after be
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>subscribed, shall be ordered and disposed as they and future Sub∣scribers shall agree upon and direct from time to time.</P>
<P>Whe whose names are hereunto subscribed, do ingadge with, and incorporate our selves into the Society pursuant to the Ends above written.</P>
