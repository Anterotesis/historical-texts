<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat noble and that ancient Town</L>
<L><HI>Dumbrittain</HI> glorious for renown,</L>
<L>That stands upon the Silver sides,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Clyde</HI> and <HI>Leven</HI> wash't with Tydes:</L>
<L>Two Rivers scorning to change names,</L>
<L>With <HI>Tweed,</HI> or <HI>Forth,</HI> nay not with <HI>Thames;</HI></L>
<L>More venerable none can be,</L>
<L>If we respect antiquity:</L>
<L>Or if we look to Situation,</L>
<L>She is the pride of all the Nation;</L>
<L>Her port, so safe, so calm, so fair,</L>
<L>Sole object of the Seaman's pray'r;</L>
<L>Her Fort of such magnificence,</L>
<L>Is boasted <HI>Scotland</HI>'s chiefe defence;</L>
<L>Environ'd with the scalie legions,</L>
<L>The Burgers of the brinnie regions;</L>
<L>Her Buildings Graceful, and her Fields</L>
<L>Pleasure and profit jointly yields:</L>
<L>All these are worthy of great praise,</L>
<L>For which this Town deserves the bayes;</L>
<L>But in this one She doth excell,</L>
<L>And from all others bears the <HI>BELL,</HI></L>
<L>That in these awless Lawless times,</L>
<L>Famous for Faction and for Crimes,</L>
<L>She and She only strives to be,</L>
<L>Famous for pious Loyalty.</L>
<L>Therefore Commissioners has sent,</L>
<L>Indulged Traitours to prevent.</L>
<L>Her very common Bells do ring,</L>
<L>Obedience unto the <HI>KING,</HI></L>
<L>That nothing in the Town may be,</L>
<L>But what may sound their Loyalty,</L>
<L>Ev'n just like <HI>A'rons</HI> Bells of Gold,</L>
<L>That did both sound and teach of old.</L>
<L><HI>Dumbrittans</HI> Bell as ye shall hear,</L>
<L>Can charm the Heart, and Chim the eare,</L>
<L>An instance whereof ye may mark,</L>
<L>In honest <HI>Thomas Walker</HI> Clerk,</L>
<L>A Man who from this very story,</L>
<L>May reckon'd be <HI>Dumbrittains</HI> Glory;</L>
<L>Just like the Town Clerk in the Acts,</L>
<L>That was made Famous by such Facts;</L>
<L>Tho he did but appease a strife,</L>
<L>But <HI>Thomas</HI> did convert his Wife,</L>
<L>And therefore in records of Fame,</L>
<L>Deserves a farr more noble Name;</L>
<L>This was the way he her converted,</L>
<L>To Conventicles She had started,</L>
<L>Wherefore he vow'd Her to divorse,</L>
<L>And would admitt of no remorse,</L>
<L>And that all men might clearly see,</L>
<L>How Zealous he resolv'd to bee,</L>
<L>He for the skillet <HI>Bell</HI> doth call,</L>
<L>To roap what was in House or Hall;</L>
<L>That so She might for ay despair</L>
<L>His person, or his goods to share.</L>
<L>The <HI>Bell</HI> doth clank, the Rogue doth cry,</L>
<L>Who'le <HI>Thomas Walkers</HI> Goods, come buy;</L>
<L>For <HI>Thomas</HI> he his Wife will banish,</L>
<L>And his whole House he will displenish,</L>
<L>And teach all Husbands to their shame.</L>
<L>A Wife's ane easie thing to tame.</L>
<L>The Woman come of ancient race,</L>
<L>The <HI>Watsons</HI> chief Men of that plac▪</L>
<L>Who for their valiant Loyal<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></L>
<L>Were gifted with the Sacred Tree.</L>
<L>Then which their's no Tree unto fate.</L>
<L>A Tennant of a longer date;</L>
<L>The <HI>Watson</HI> for his Manly stroake,</L>
<L>Doth in his Arms bear the Oake.</L>
<L>Gentle She, and melting hearted,</L>
<L>At the first noise of this She started,</L>
<L>And ay the more the <HI>Bell</HI> it sounded,</L>
<L>The more, the more She was confounded,</L>
<L>And now She thought the time was come</L>
<L>That She would get Queen <HI>Vashties</HI> D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om</L>
<L>And did begin to fear the worst,</L>
<L>And in Her Heart <HI>Phanaticks</HI> curst,</L>
<L>And their debausht and lawless Meetings,</L>
<L>That are Prophane and Godless Cheatings,</L>
<L>That discord make in Church and State,</L>
<L>And in all Families debate.</L>
<L>But chiefly thought Her self accurst,</L>
<L>That from Her dear must be divorc't:</L>
<L>Her head was full of dolefull notions:</L>
<L>Her Heart with melancholy motions:</L>
<L>Her words with sighs all chequered are,</L>
<L>And with Her hair Her hands made Warr</L>
<L>But still the <HI>Bells</HI> most shamefull sound;</L>
<L>Her heart with grief did most confound.</L>
<L>And had not Friends by Intercession,</L>
<L>Caus'd <HI>Thomas</HI> pardon Her Trangres<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></L>
<L>Then suddenly Her fatal Breath</L>
<L>Had pay'd it's last arrears to Death</L>
<L>But now all Persons Her do see</L>
<L>A Zealot in Conformity.</L>
<L>Who Poyson in Her Meat would d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></L>
<L>Far sooner then offend a Bishop,</L>
<L>And with impatience doth endure it</L>
<L>To hear ane ill word of a Curate</L>
<L>When primrose in <HI>December</HI> gr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></L>
