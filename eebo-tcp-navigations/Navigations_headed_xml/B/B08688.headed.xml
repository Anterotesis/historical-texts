<HEAD>THE CHARGE OF THE Admirals of England.</HEAD>
<P>Licensed according to Order.</P>
<P>AS <HI>England</HI> is Wall'd round with a Wall of Water, Her De∣fence of that Wall by Her Floating Castles, Her Naval Strength and Management, is her greatest, if not almost Her only Bulwarks and Rampants. This is most certain, as the <HI>British</HI> Empire holds a two-fold <HI>Regale,</HI> Her <HI>Scepter,</HI> and Her <HI>Trident;</HI> Her Dominion at Land, and Her Soveraignty at Sea; so, that Maritine Principality being the <HI>Frontiers</HI> and <HI>Out-lines</HI> of Her whole Power and Territories, and consequently Her chiefest Strength, as being Her only Inlet; that Deputed Hand, that under the Imperial Commission, has the <HI>Charge</HI> of Her <HI>Admiralty,</HI> has the highest Post of Honour, and the most Impor∣tant Trust that a Crown'd Head can lodge in a Subject. For, as no At∣taque can be made upon <HI>England,</HI> without first gaining Her <HI>Mastery</HI> of the <HI>Sea,</HI> the Preservation of that fairest of Her Crown-Jewels is, and ought to be Her ablest Care and Industry.</P>
<P>This is notoriously manifest from the never-dying Fame of our Great <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> where one intire Naval Triumph o're <HI>Spain,</HI> was of more Advantage to this Kingdom, and carried more Trophies along with it, than all the Battles and Successes of a <HI>Third Edward,</HI> or a <HI>Fifth Henry,</HI> in the very Bowels of <HI>France.</HI> For, to summ the whole Grandeur of that Greatest of Potentates, and best of Queens; Her Sword-work at Land, tho' encompassed with Enemies, was nothing to Her Thunder-work at <HI>Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The Fortune of that single Stroke, attended with so great a Blow upon <HI>Spain,</HI> and Her prudent Caution of suppressing the Maritine Growth of <HI>France,</HI> even against their great <HI>Fourth Henry</HI> himself, in threatning to burn his Navy in their Harbour for so much as attempting to build a Capital <HI>Ship of War,</HI> was of that high Import to the <HI>English</HI> Grandeur; that had Her Politicks been pursued, and Her Advantages from that onely Success been rightly improved by Her Masculine, tho' (Heavens knows) more Effeminate Successors; <HI>England</HI> had held the Scale of <HI>Europe</HI> to
<PB REF="2"/>End of the World, and the present Greatness of <HI>France,</HI> the now Terror of <HI>Christendom,</HI> had been wholly an impracticable Attempt and Ambition.</P>
<P>But as the aforesaid Esteminacy of the succeeding Reigns, utterly ne∣glected that fortunate Occasion, and lost the happy <HI>Forelock;</HI> which had we held, we had awed the whole World, and preserved the <HI>English</HI> Greatness, as immortal, as that <HI>Princesses</HI> never-dying Memory, and has thereby so infinitely lessened our Original <HI>British</HI> Lustre: Nevertheless, 'tis not so late, even after all our Losses, and former Mis-managements, to en∣deavour some part at least of so necessary a Recovery. This Glory at least we have to boast, for our Encouragement, That never more hardy Cou∣rage sate on the <HI>English</HI> Throne than now. Nor a <HI>Prince,</HI> whose Endea∣vours and Zeal can be more strenuous, or more indefatigable, for the Redemption of our too long falling Glory. Cou'd all Hands follow; but as this leads, both Fear and Despair would be far from our Doors, and a new Dawn of Hopes surronnd us.</P>
<P>But to return to our <HI>Admiral</HI>'s Cause: As the <HI>Sea</HI> is a <HI>Divisum Im∣perium,</HI> a separate Soveraignty from that of the <HI>Land;</HI> and accordingly the Laws; by which all Maritine Affairs are tried, are different from the common Law of the Nation; So the <HI>Lord High Admiral</HI> of <HI>England</HI>'s Commission, as so much different from any other Command, constitutes him no less than a <HI>Viceroy;</HI> a Title above any other Dignity, or Prefer∣ment whatever.</P>
<P>If the Honour of the Command it self be so Eminent and Illustrious, the Faithful and Zealous Execution of it must be truly more Honourable and Illustrious; for indeed 'tis only the Discharge of a Trust, and the Exertion of Virtuous Actions, and Gallant Atchievements, are the true Foundati∣on of Renown and Glory.</P>
<P>As the ever-memorable <HI>Drake</HI> has left a Name that will live as long Time it self shall last; we may likewise add, That our latter Honourable Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> has acquired as large a share of Fame, as true <HI>English</HI> Courage, rewarded with Success and Victory, can well reach. And 'tis highly to be wish'd, that our this present Years latter Expedition, in our <HI>Joynt Commission of Admiralty,</HI> cou'd have met with as fair a Chapplet of Lawrels. But if either any unsmiling Providences above, or unhappier Conduct below, have deny'd us that Blessing; 'tis our Misfortune, that so fair a Chian should ever be broken, and that such Signal Happinesses should be other than the continued show'ring Favours of our kind Stars.</P>
<P>But whether our this Years Unhappiness at <HI>Sea</HI> was <HI>Misfortune,</HI> or <HI>Mis-management,</HI> is a Province above me; 'tis safficient, that <HI>Sub Judice lis est.</HI> The Cause is depending before the Great Council of the Land, Our Patriots in <HI>Parliament</HI> Assembled, whose Vigilance and Wisdom, as they have the Inspection now before them; so their Hands have the Bal∣lance, and Scales, to do Justice accordingly.</P>
