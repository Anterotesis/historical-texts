<HEAD>The Courant out of Italy and Germany, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>From Roome the 7 August, 1621.</HEAD>
<P>VVEhere from Palermo that there is in Messina a preparation of al manner pro∣vision against the coming of the Prince Phile∣bert / for to use them in the Catholicq armye / ther ar also many instruments of warr made for some enterprise.</P>
<P>The Knight of Malta Sarchio / is here arrived againe from Prage / for to make a Company of horsemen.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>From Venise, the 13. of August.</HEAD>
<P>By waye of Genua / there is confirmed from Spaine / that Don Rodrigo Calderone slalbe openly estrangldd / and his goods Confisquated / because of so me murther taken in hand by him / and there ar remitted of his goods for the warrs of the lowe contryes sixtie thousand crownes.</P>
<P>We understand from Milan / that those <HI>7.</HI> Suyt∣ser Cantons Catholicques / doe hold nothing at all with the Graubonders / and that they also will not appeare in the day appointed to Badē which is held by the Buntnars for a great despising: and which might well be a cause to make them come togither by the eares.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>From Vienne, the 19. dito</HEAD>
<P>The miserie in Marcvelt doen by the Hongers in burning one hondert and twentie villadges / is confermed: the Conte of Iagerendorp with the help that he hath receyved from Bethlehem Gabor / is nou twenty thousand strong / and have besidg the towne of Presbourg about a myle from the same: and all the people that were in the subarbes have put the fire in them and are fled for feare of the siedge / and are gone within the towne / and all those among them which have bin fond not to be cityzens / have bin driven out of the citye: they they also very fast / and because then provision must goe from hence / it is to be feared it wil be cut of from them / wich maye ea∣sily be done.</P>
<P>Bethlehem himself is gone from Thurna up∣wards by S. Iorges / there is also one Lord of Hongaria hier / which hath had audience by the Emperour / his message was of peace / which must be effected within three weekes / otherwise it is not possible to keep the Turk backe: the Clergye doeth much labour unto it.</P>
<P>The Budiani / which doeth much hurt over all / is going with <HI>15000</HI> strong / and expects more forces from Iagerendorp / he takes his course to∣wards Crembs / and meanes to joyne himself with Bethlehem for Moravie / so as here is over all very great feare: the Emperour is purposed within <HI>14</HI> dayes to depart from this City: but it is unknowen where he goeth.</P>
<P>Hier ar about <HI>6000</HI> fled from other places / who by reason of the last of their goods / doe seeke Almes.</P>
<P>This daye ar ther niewes tome / that the Ene∣my lyes before Presbourg with <HI>36</HI> peeces of Or∣donnance / and that he hath demanded the City <HI>2</HI> dayes agon / and begon to shutt upon it. There ar within the City three Regiments of footmen and <HI>700.</HI> Horsemen: they have Ammonition inough / but it must goe from hence / which will hardly be effected.</P>
<P>The Englisch Ambassador have had also an answer / he hath bin at the Assembly of Regens∣bourg: where it hath bin answered unto him / that howsoever it might be granted unto the Kingh of England and other Potentats / treves in the Palatinat / for in the meyne tyme to seeke te come to an agremēt / yet there are these things in the waye that hinders it / to it / the atttentats of Mansvelt in Boheme and of Iagerendorps in Slesie / who doe proceede in warres with great hostilitye in the name of the Palts-Grave things wholly contrary to the presentation of the King of England.</P>
<P>Here is againe anothet Ambassador come out of England / with six persons.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>From Prage, the 19. dito.</HEAD>
<P>For asmuch as both with in and with out this city / ther beginneth again spoiling and robbing / thet is therfore the <HI>13.</HI> of this moneth patens gone out that all those that ar masterlesse and not ci∣tyzens / as also those that doe not discharge city∣zens dutyes in their callings that they shall pre∣sently depicite from the city / upon peyne of cor∣poral punishment.</P>
<P>Concerning the yeelding of the towne of Ta∣bor / ther is hetherto little efferted / they have ho∣pe to be delivred of the siedge by meanes of Mās∣velt.</P>
<P>Concernin Hongarie and Moravie / little can be said of it because that <HI>2.</HI> Posts from Vienna have already bin turned barch / housoever some certen carriers bringes niewes / that the Hongres ar certeyn thousand strong / who doe overrunne from Vienna unto Moravie / and doe burn and spoyle and kill all that they meet with all / wich makes here a trible-feare: and wee know not whethet the Posts have bin taken or maide awa∣ye the Commissares also of the Emperour which were come hither about the execueion ar returned but we doubt with extreme danger of falling in the handes of the enemy.</P>

<HEAD>From Bearn 20 August.</HEAD>
