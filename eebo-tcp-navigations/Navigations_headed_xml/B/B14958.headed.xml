<HEAD>The Continuation of our Weekely NEWES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Rome,</HI> <DATE>the 1. of May.</DATE></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen the Cardinall of <HI>Strigonia</HI> vnderstood hee should not be admitted to haue audience of the <HI>Pope</HI> as <HI>Imperiall</HI> Ambassador, he did desire, that he might be heard by what Title soever. Thus his Holinesse gaue him audience, and his speech and com∣plaints did last almost two houres, where the <HI>Pope</HI> was so troubled and wearied withall, that the Ambassadour of <HI>Tosca∣ny,</HI> comming in after that the sayd Cardinall of <HI>Strigonia</HI> was gone, found the <HI>Pope</HI> so displeased, that he could not treat a∣bout any businesse, but onely entertained the <HI>Pope</HI> with some other discourses, to make him merry againe. And the <HI>Pope</HI> himselfe (confessing to be overwearied about the Cardinals propositions) departed afterwards out of <HI>Rome,</HI> retyring himselfe into the Country, vpon the Patrimoniall land, lea∣ving strict order, that none should come thither for any ne∣gotiation. He went away on Wednesday morning, and will not returne till the twentieth of this Moneth of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>Foure Gentle-men of this Citie of <HI>Rome,</HI> being chosen by the Councell of the <HI>Campidoglio,</HI> haue beene with the <HI>Pope,</HI> to beseech him, not to yeelde to the demands made for <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Austria,</HI> concerning the treasure of the Castle. Where∣upon the <HI>Pope</HI> with admirable eloquence (wherein indeede he doth excell) made a faire speech in answere, representing with an exaggeration the favours formerly shewed to the sayd house of <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> in giving them sums of
<PB N="2" REF="2"/> monies amounting to many Millions, and there hee broke forth in teares, saying: <HI>Pro gratiarum actione</HI> and for a re∣compence, We finde now there is layd waite for our life; Our life is sought for in our owne house; And should We now giue to them the sustenance, the bowels, the blood of this Citie? Let it neuer be sayd. They would haue vs thus stripped and naked, afterwards to invade <HI>Rome,</HI> and to com∣mit against vs, against you (My Lords) against your wiues, against your children, against your blood, against the Chur∣ches, against God himselfe, those cruelties and that wicked∣nesse, which an hundred yeares agone, were committed in <HI>Rome.</HI> The fore-sayd <HI>Romane</HI> Gentlemen being dismissed, went forth full of complaints and hatred against the sayd house.</P>
<P>You cannot beleeue with what a generall joy and applause here is received the newes of the falling of the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI> into <HI>Bavaria,</HI> wherof I will not tell you more at this time, for feare you doe take it as if I did write it out of passion, al∣though I can assure you, that that Duke is here thought to haue beene the chiefest cause of the miseries in <HI>Germanie,</HI> and that his exorbitant ambition hath deserved farre greater pu∣nishment, then he can receiue, though he should bee vsed ten times worse then those, whom without cause he most vnjust∣ly and cruelly hath persecuted and robbed, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>An extract of a Letter written at <HI>Warshaw,</HI> <DATE>the 5. of Aprill, 1632.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Concerning the warre with <HI>Muscovia,</HI> it is thought it can∣not be shunned. Therefore there are tenne thousand men to march towards the limits, to obserue what the <HI>Russians</HI> intend to doe, and (if it be possible) to make some longer truce, or finding the contrary, to send quickly word thereof hither to the Court. In which case, there shall be more forces sent thi∣therwards, and the Prince also is then to carrie some troopes, (some speake of 12000. men) and joyne with the former, and so withstand the said <HI>Muscovits:</HI> And according as the
<PB N="3" REF="2"/> enemie shall be found strong, so those of <HI>Littaw</HI> shall then helpe accordingly. And to this end both the <HI>Polonians</HI> and <HI>Li∣thuanians</HI> haue graunted a Subsidie of <HI>two pobores,</HI> whereof two are to bee paid presently, and two about <HI>Michaelmas</HI> next.</P>
<P>As for the children of our late Queene, the States of <HI>Po∣land,</HI> haue taken so good an order that they are now suffici∣ently prouided for, to the great contentment of the King. For Prince <HI>Iohn Albert,</HI> who is an Ecclesiasticall person, hee is to haue the Bishoprick of <HI>Cracow:</HI> And although there was no mention or expression made of the other Church-man, to witt, of the Bishop of <HI>Neis:</HI> Yet neuer∣thelesse it is supposed, hee shall haue that of <HI>Ermband,</HI> which the second Prince hath hitherto possessed. And as for the two politick Princes, named, <HI>Casimerus</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> and likewise the Princesse their Sister, amongst them the goods both moueables and immoueables, as <HI>Chivaza, Galbe, Stras∣burg</HI> and what else shee did injoye both in <HI>Poland</HI> and in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> shall bee divided; according as his Majestie shall thinke best to giue order for. At this free offer of the States the King hath taken much content, and to shew himselfe thankfull for such an vnexpected bounty and libe∣rality, he hath both thanked them and surrendered some re∣venues, which before were accounted amongst the due rents, to returne after his death vnto the States of the Kingdom: &amp; the said lands are granted vnto the said princes with con∣dition, that after their death they doe returne to the pos∣session of certaine noblemen.</P>
<P>By this meanes the Prince <HI>Ratziville,</HI> is come againe in∣to great fauor of the olde King, because he tooke great paines to haue the said Princes all well provided, according to right and reason (as he said) seeing the King their father neg∣lecting and loonsig his owne hereditary dominions came so freely and contented himselfe with the Electiue king∣dome. As for the matter of Coynes and the monie so much complained of, it is referred to the next Parliament, and re∣maines meane while in the olde estate.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<P>And concerning the point of <HI>Inter-regnum</HI> and gouernment if the King should bee too sicke or dye, it hath also beene delayed and left to some other Parliament. Because many of the Burgesses had no instruction about that affaire, and o∣thers did conceiue, that his Majestie did intend to put the governement into the hands of his sonne <HI>Casimer,</HI> and so to procure him the succession to the Crowne wherunto there is no likelyhood the States will euer giue their consent. The rest of what was done, you will find in the printed con∣clusion of this parliament, which to make an end, spent three dayes, by reason that the good olde King was not able to fit so long.</P>

<HEAD>Extract out of an other letter, dated at <HI>Warshaw</HI> <DATE>the 29. of Aprill 1632.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Since my last which was of the 5. of this moneth, our King fell againe very sicke, and because he often did rcover, we had no great feare he should as yet die: but it was Gods pleasure to take him away on this very day, which is the 29. of <HI>A∣prill:</HI> I cannot tell you at this time other particularities about his death, for I haue my selfe beene not well these many daies, and therefore beene absent from Court. I will therefore on∣ly tell you, that although there was hitherto no doubt, but the States would without any great consultation or conside∣ration make choise of the eldest Prince <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> to make him King of <HI>Poland.</HI> Yet neverthelesse I am at this very in∣stant informed from a very good hand, that the Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold</HI> (the Emperors brother) hath (during the sicknesse of our late King) made himselfe a great partie, who intends to stand for him to make him King: There are also others that ayme another way: I pray God to keepe vs from dissention among our selues; and I hope yet, that our Prince (against whom there can be no exception at all) shall bee our King, and so we shall remaine in quietnesse whereof (God willing) I will giue you an account by my next.</P>

<HEAD>Contents of a Letter written from <HI>Constantino∣ple</HI> <DATE>the 28. of March, 1632.</DATE> rela∣ting the present state there.</HEAD>
<P>Here is now againe an indifferent calme, and the boiste∣rous tempest is somwhat ceased through the death of the <HI>Tefterdar,</HI> who was taken hold on the 21. of this mounth and the day following had halfe his head strooke off, and afterwards tyed by the leggs and drawne vp and hanged on the tree before the gate of the Palace of the <HI>Vizeer</HI> where the <HI>Ianizary Aga</HI> was hanged. Which caused great joy and acclamation among the people, not onely the Militarie, but all Nations and sorts of people, of what ranke soever, dwel∣ling within this Citie. The consultation and plot was con∣cluded and agreeed vpon by the great Turke or Emperour, &amp; the three lately murdered persons, namely thus; presently vp∣on the tydings of the death of the deposed <HI>Ʋizeer,</HI> also to dispatch and make away the now raigning <HI>Rogieb Bassha.</HI> The <HI>Tefterdar Ʋizeer,</HI> the <HI>Ianizar Aga,</HI> Captaine <HI>Bassha</HI> or Ad∣mirall of the Sea, and to make the <HI>Chamberlaine Muza Qui∣lebij, Ianizar Aga.</HI> And afterward by the assistance (or at least permission) of the other <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> (whom they thought ge∣nerally to corrupt with great gifts and briberies) to massacre all the <HI>Syphahies,</HI> by that meanes to confirme the authoritie of the Emperour, or great <HI>Turke,</HI> and re-establish the same.</P>
<P>It is received for a generall opinion, that the <HI>Ʋizeer,</HI> who first broached this businesse and plotted this mischiefe, is fal∣len in great distaste &amp; disgrace with the great <HI>Turke</HI> or Emp: however it doth not yet burst forth or appeare; but in the meane time there is a vigilant eye over him. And that his <HI>Im∣periall</HI> Majestie when time shall serue (to wit, as soone as the <HI>Syphahies</HI> shall be destroyed) will make the world sensible of his resentment and affection of the said plot, which he cannot but take to heart, and will plenarily take his opportune re∣venge: Although the afore-sayd <HI>Vizeer</HI> is one of the best and
<PB N="6" REF="4"/> ablest men, which this Empire hath produced this long time, and <HI>(quod rarum est)</HI> is generally beloved and affected of all Nations and all people.</P>
<P>Two dayes agoe about sixe thousand <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> which are termed <HI>Symenj,</HI> were sent with their Commaunders to <HI>Mous∣sul,</HI> to helpe to keepe and defend the same Citie; as also the Frontiers against the inroad of the <HI>Persians,</HI> because the Mi∣litarie is againe retired backe-</P>

<HEAD>Newes from <HI>Germanie,</HI> viz: <HI>Franckford,</HI> and <HI>Augsburg,</HI> <DATE>the 28 of May, 1632.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> with the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> are at this present at <HI>Munchen</HI> in <HI>Bavaria.</HI> The Ambassadour of <HI>France</HI> is mediating of a peace, in the behalfe of the Duke of <HI>Bava∣ria:</HI> which is thought will bee accomplished, with great fa∣vour of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who hath divided his Armie in two parts, so that wee doe expect speedily some strange ef∣fects.</P>
<P>It is vncredible of the vnestimable wealth that the King hath found in the said Citie of <HI>Munchen,</HI> and especially in the <HI>Iesuits</HI> Church, with Images made by <HI>Brouse</HI> that famous Artist, and the manufactures of silver worke of divers kinds. In fine, there is not any Church in the world, that is more ri∣cher or costlier, it is counted the second Esquriall. The King hath found in this Citie the best and fairest Ordnance that e∣ver man beheld.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Rome</HI> <DATE>the 21. of Aprill.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The Viceroy of <HI>Napels</HI> hath by a printed Proclamation made knowne to all the inhabitants throughout that whole Kingdome, the great necessity and want that now the house of <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Spaine</HI> doe suffer, by reason of the warres in <HI>Germany</HI> and opposition of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and to this end hath admonished all those that are of any abilitie to raise each of them one horseman, or otherwise to contribute and pay 30. Ducates towards the maintenance of the great warres now in hand. And did also declare in the publication, that his Mai: of <HI>Spaine</HI> himselfe in person will this summer betake himselfe in the feild with a mighty Army. To which end he hath required his owne Kingdome of <HI>Spaine</HI> to main∣taine 30000. foote, and 6000. horse, which now are sud∣dainly to be leuied.</P>

<P>The Spanyard is said to be at this present very desirous and earnest to contract a peace with the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>The said King of Spaine doth require great contribution from the Spirituality, and doth impose taxations vpon them for the maintaining of these warres against the King of <HI>Swe∣den.</HI> And hath required these of the Kingdome of <HI>Arrago∣nia, Catalania</HI> and <HI>Valentia,</HI> to contribute largely toward his present occasions, as being the most able and richest of his Dominions, but it is said, they haue vtterly refused the same. And caused his Mai: to vnderstand, that they would be very glad, If they heare and perceiue that he did not so much trouble himselfe with the present affaires in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>

<P>This day the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> breakes vp with his Army from <HI>Landshut,</HI> but whether he tends we cannot yet know. The Deputies of <HI>Munchen</HI> cannot agree about the condi∣tions, but his Maiestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> will doubtlesse decide the question, for they are at his will and power. The whole Bishopricke of <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>esingen</HI> is freely yeelded vp to his Maiesty and payd him contribution. Hereupon some Boores in <HI>Swa∣ben</HI> being 10000. strong haue assembled themselues toge∣ther, they haue taken againe <HI>Leutkirch</HI> and <HI>Wengen,</HI> they haue with them some peeces of Ordnance. But some of our forces which are already sent against them wil soone coole their courage,</P>
<P>This weeke the aforementioned Boores did ouercome and surprise 50. <HI>Swedish</HI> soldiers. <HI>Crabates,</HI> betweene <HI>Shro∣benhousen</HI> and <HI>Sticha.</HI> These Boores when they had maste∣red them, did cut off their eares and noses, chopt off their hands and feete, &amp; put out their eyes▪ and so left them, these deuilish Boores doe great mischiefe of the like nature. As soone as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was aduertised of the cruell in∣solencies of those Boores▪ hee was much displeased, and so much the more, because he saw that his soldiers would not put it vp▪ but presently cryed reuenge and fired their villa∣ges, insomuch that in one day there were seene two hun∣dred seuerall fires blazing at once.</P>

<P>About <HI>Bregenty</HI> and those parts, the Catholicke Boores assembled together, being some thousands of them they haue taken <HI>Wangen</HI> and <HI>Rauensburgh,</HI> and therein slaine all the Swedish Soldiers. Therevpon the Swedish Generall hath yesterday brought all the Swedish troupes together, and is fully resolued, since the Boores haue not kept the a∣greement formerly made, to destroy them all with fire and sword; and whereas the Swedish did vnderstand, that the Commander <HI>Harancourt</HI> was on the march from <HI>Alsatia</HI> with some thousands of men to adioyne his forces to those of the Duke of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> they presently sent for more foote forces from <HI>Ausburg</HI> and those parts, and some <HI>Crabates</HI> also, with intention to meete with them. And now comes tydings, that the Swedish haue surprized some of the Boores neere vnto <HI>Weingarten,</HI> and slaine two hun∣dred of them, and put the rest to flight. How the other shall speed wee shall ere long acquaint you.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bauarian</HI> forces haue lately murthered some of the Swedish <HI>Saue-guards,</HI> wherefore the <HI>Bauarians</HI> must not looke for quarter when they shall come to fall into the Swedish hands.</P>

<P>We understand from the Royall Army of <HI>Sweden,</HI> that his Maiesty of <HI>Sweden</HI> himselfe in person is now come be∣fore <HI>Munchen:</HI> and since they seeme not to accept of his Mai: Articles of agreement, it is thought the King will give that City as a prey to his souldiers, for it is at his d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uotion.</P>
<P>Three of the Kings Regiments were lately sent forth to∣ward <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> to observe how things stood there: but part of them fell to pillaging; in the meane time, 3. Regiments of <HI>Bavarians</HI> fell out of the City, and surprised some of the <HI>Swedes</HI> and slew them, but the other <HI>Swedes</HI> recollecting their forces together, fell upon the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> and defeated some, drove them all backe, being glad, to take their Citie for refuge.</P>

<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> are at <HI>Landsberg,</HI> which they tooke lately, and found great store of Ordnance and munition: besides the Ordnance also great and small 18. in number, they obtained there 100. Wagons with munition.</P>
<P>The Commander <HI>Sparrenter</HI> hath taken <HI>Dunckenspiel,</HI> and is now ayming at <HI>Ellwang,</HI> the Boores thereabout come very strong together, but the <HI>Bavarians</HI> doubtlesse will not long keepe that City.</P>

<P>Newes at this present we have but little, onely that we doe now from hence take our way to <HI>Munchen,</HI> the City of residence, of the Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> The Deputies of that Citie were yesterday here, but were not admitted to speake with his Maiesty.</P>

<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> forces are yet in and about <HI>Spier,</HI> they fortifie themselves there. And notwithstanding that City hath yeelded them 80000. Ryxdollars for Contribution, the Ci∣tizens neverthelesse, are pillaged and abused without any respect at all. The chiefe of the City intend to betake them∣selves to <HI>Strasburg.</HI></P>
<PB N="13" REF="7"/>
<P>The City of <HI>Worms</HI> is dayly fortified, they have broken downe the Suburbs, all the Citizens that are able must la∣bour about the Workes. In like manner is <HI>Manheym</HI> Pro∣vided.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedish</HI> forces are commanded to the <HI>Mozell,</HI> to have good regard unto the <HI>Spanish</HI> forces. To which end, all the passages are beset.</P>
<P>Yesterday there were brought hither divers pieces of Ordnance, and are to be sent from hence to <HI>Mentz,</HI> which City is also fortified.</P>
<P>Her Mai: the Queen of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as yet resides heere, the Chancelor <HI>Oxenstern</HI> is at <HI>Mentz,</HI> we doe not yet heare that the <HI>Spanish</HI> do attempt any thing more than what they have done already.</P>
<P>Now presently we have received tydings, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> at <HI>Zimmern</HI> have taken two Commissaries Prisoners, and one Captaine, with divers Spanish souldiers, and have brought them to <HI>Mentz. Don Gonzales de Cordua</HI> is not yet passed over the River of <HI>Mozell.</HI></P>

<P>Since our Gouernour here hath brought the whole Circle of <HI>Swaben</HI> vnder the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> contribution he went into the Dukedome of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> where he receiued from the Administrator 2000. land soldiers. During his absence frō hence we receiued newes that diuers of the Catholicks in this Circle, especially some Abbots &amp; other Churchmen, one Lord <HI>Druches</HI> of <HI>Waldburg</HI> and other Gentlemen, did rebell and gathered both their owne and other subiects of the house of <HI>Austria:</HI> and that the said troopes did much harme and did use great cruelties against such Swedish soul∣diers as they did meet withall. But now we doe likewise understand that the <HI>Swedish</HI> Dragons: that lay in <HI>Biberach,</HI> to revenge these perfidious and foule dealings, fell into the Dominions of the sayd Lord <HI>Druchses,</HI> pillaging and burning downe diuers Villages and Townes, as <HI>Wurthach, Waldsee,</HI> and others.</P>

<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> went with his Army from <HI>Preisengen</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="8"/> towards <HI>Munchen,</HI> the Magistrates whereof to save theyt City from pillaging, did offer the King two hundred thou∣sand Dollars, but the King doth not accept of theyr offer, and is still marching thitherwards.</P>
<P>We doe heare from <HI>Ingolstadt,</HI> that there doe lye three Regiments of <HI>Bavarian</HI> souldiers for Garrison in it, which are commanded by young <HI>Tilly.</HI></P>
<P>We receive likewise newes, that fourteene thousand Boores, that had gathered themselves about the Towne called <HI>Winegarten,</HI> to refuse the promised Contribution, and to defend themselves against the <HI>Swedes:</HI> were no sooner met with about 3000. Swedish souldiers, but they presently cast away theyr armes, and yeilded themselves. Their Ge∣nerall being a Gentleman called <HI>Shwendy</HI> was taken Priso∣ner, and is to be brought hither.</P>
<P>It is also confirmed, that Colonell <HI>Rhelinger,</HI> being accom∣panied with 15 horsemen, met by chance with 50 Crabats, amongst whom he couragiously setting, he slew some, and tooke thirty of them Prisoners, and the rest saved them∣selves by the swiftnesse of their horses.</P>
