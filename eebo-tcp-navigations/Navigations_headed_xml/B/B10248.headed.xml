<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He <HI>Belgick</HI> Pro∣vinces for the last Century have been such a Thea∣tre of <HI>Mars,</HI> that all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> have little reason to thank the <HI>Spa∣niard</HI>
<PB REF="4"/> for enforcing the States of <HI>Holland</HI> to know and use their own power and strength; and therefore it was gravely expressed by a sober Person, that to have all the Low Coun∣tries governed by a few States, or by one Prince, wholly de∣pending upon the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> would be equally dan∣gerous: but it doth most com∣port with the interest of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> in Wisdom and Policy, to erect and establish such a Prince as should neither alto∣gether depend upon <HI>France,</HI> or be wholly devoted unto <HI>Spain;</HI> or else to divide the Seventeen Provinces into di∣vers
<PB REF="4"/> several Cantons, whereby some of them being induced to affect <HI>England,</HI> and others to favour Princes of their Re∣ligion, they could not render themselves so formidable.</P>
<P>How prudent an expedient this would be for the security of <HI>England,</HI> and to establish peace in Christendom, I submit it unto your Lordships grave judgement, who is perfectly acquainted with all the Criti∣cismes of State. But that which is the just admiration of all wise men, the lesser moie∣ty of these Provinces hath far exceeded even the whole, and seven Provinces are become
<PB REF="5"/> greater and more potent then Seventeen: In Riches and Power they have out-done some of the greatest Princes in <HI>Europe.</HI> Their Cities are many and splendid; and yet there are more Sects among them then Cities, and as ma∣ny Creeds as Heads: but if they had imitated your Lord∣ship when you did them the honour to live amongst them, (the regularity of your De∣votions being with such re∣verence) you had made all their Provinces Canonical: yet they have learned to vernish their lucre with De∣votion, and to make godli∣ness
<PB REF="5"/> a Page to their pri∣vate Interest, and to be so wise in any of their meet∣ings never to discourse of Religion; their Opinions therein, being as opposite as the sides of the Diameter; but they all concentre in this one Ecliptick line, to darken the Authority of Princes.</P>
<P>Your Lordship (being so great an Artizan of State) understands all their <HI>Arca∣na</HI> and Mysteries; and so great a Captain, as (this AGE with much difficulty hath not produced a greater) you know all their Policies and
<PB REF="6"/> Stratagems of War; by the first your Lordship hath much en∣gaged your own Nation; by the other, you may live to oblige all Nations of the World. I do beg your Lord∣ships pardon for this interru∣ption, leaving the <HI>Grandeur</HI> of your Actions, and the Glory of your Name, to be blazon'd by the Heralds of Time, and celebrated in the lasting Chro∣nicles of after-Ages.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>Est thou shoul∣dest have cause <HI>(Gentle Rea∣der)</HI> to <HI>Quaere</HI> this present E∣dition of the Exact Survey of the Ʋnited Provinces of the Netherlands, considering the many Essays written of that Subject; at the
<PB REF="7"/> instance of the worthy Author of this excellent and useful Discourse, I was desired to advertise thee, that some honourable Friends of his put him upon this present work, which in their noble concepti∣ons would be very acceptable to the Publick. By this To∣pographical Discourse thou art brought to more familiar acquaintance with the scite, strength, present state and con∣dition of those Belgick Coun∣tries, which for this last Cen∣tury had so bravely quit them∣selves, maugre the utmost Po∣licies and Hostilities of their great and formidable Enemies:
<PB REF="7"/> and when you hear of this or that other Town or Castle of theirs either taken or besieged, upon a slight perusal of it, up∣on all occasions, you may be a∣ble to judge of those matters. The Author hereof hath seri∣ously consulted with most of the Grave Writers both Cosmogra∣phers &amp; Historians, and others of the greatest note which have hitherto written of those Coun∣tries and Provinces, from whom (besides his own observations) he hath received no small light &amp; assistance: &amp; having brought this Web out of the Loom, he here presents it to the judicious Eye of the Candid Reader,
<PB REF="8"/> wherein, without much trouble or cost, he may behold the sad face in its full dimension, of the late most High and Mighty States of the Ʋnited Pro∣vinces, that seemed so lately to eclipse and shadow much of the Grandeur and Glory of the most Potent and absolute Princes, now lamentably it self eclipsed, and rent in pieces; and Peace, the fairest flower in Paradise, and the pleasantest Fruit upon the Tree of Life, is here in Ex∣ile: so that you may say of them, as the Poet of <HI>Rome:</HI>
<Q><L>Qui miserandae videt veteris vestigia <HI>Romae,</HI></L>
<L>Ille potest merito dicere <HI>Roma</HI> fuit.</L></Q>
<Q><PB REF="8"/>
<L><HI>They who the Ruines of first</HI> Rome <HI>behold,</HI></L>
<L><HI>May say,</HI> Rome <HI>is not now, but was of old.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>If in <HI>Anno 1584,</HI> the <HI>poor distressed People of the Low Countries</HI> was their Epithet in all their humble Addresses to the then Queen of <HI>England,</HI> what they then spake as Politi∣cians, possibly the same they may now say as Realists. But Pride will have its Fall sooner or later; Perfidiousness and In∣gratitude will never go long unpunished.</P>
<P>And truly three of the har∣dest things in the world are,
<PB REF="9"/> To Quadrate a Circle; to finde out the Philosophers Stone; and to make the Dutch grate∣ful. The first Office of Grati∣tude is to receive a good turn Civilly, then to retain it in Me∣mory, and acknowledge it; and lastly, to endeavour a requital. How far they are from these, their Insolencies to the English Nation will easily tell you; they daily do heap injuries on the English whom they have so highly wronged, as if the latter injuries would give counte∣nance of Justice to the former: and to speak truly, if we should be left to their mercies, we should be stript as bare as <HI>Dio∣genes</HI> did <HI>Plato</HI>'s Man.</P>
<PB REF="9"/>
<P>'Twas <HI>England</HI> that first raised them, and it was the King of Great <HI>Britain</HI> that un∣der God would have preserved and protected them, if they had kept their Ancient Boundaries, and not been too ignorant of their true Interest. At present they seem to the world a lost People, full of intrinsick confu∣sions, and upon the point of Ru∣ine; and they that have been reckoned for Great and Domi∣nical Letters in the Worlds Alphabet, are now almost blot∣ted out.</P>
<P>For their Country, it was in the General for its dimensions, fuller planted with People, Ci∣ties,
<PB REF="10"/> Great Towns, Castles, For∣tresses, Bulwarks, Forts, Gar∣risons, and for Military De∣fence, then any other Countrie in Europe. Their Naval For∣ces were prodigious, befitting Wonder rather then Words, e∣ven a Terrour to the Great Princes of the World. For their trade, it far exceeded that of the Neighbouring Princes; and in the Oeconomy of it more prudently managed. To every town they assigned some Staple-Commodity; As to <HI>Dort</HI> the Germane Wines and Corn: To <HI>Middleburgh</HI> the French and Spanish Wines: To <HI>Trevere</HI> the Scotch Trade: In <HI>Leyden,</HI>
<PB REF="10"/> in respect of her long Siege, was erected an Ʋniversity: to <HI>Har∣lem</HI> Knitting and Weaving; and to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> formerly (now <HI>Dort</HI>) the English Cloth: this maketh their Towns so equally rich and po∣pulous.</P>
<P>The Hollanders (the best Copy of Thrift in Christendom) teach their little Ditches to bear Boats; not that their Wa∣ters are more docible in this kinde then ours, but they are the more ingenious and indu∣strious School-Masters of the lesson of publique advantage, making every place in their Provinces to have access to
<PB REF="11"/> others therein, by such cheap transportation: A thing much to be desired in <HI>England;</HI> and certainly this great Metropolis, and other Cities here, would at∣tain to much more grandeur and riches, if more navigable Rivers were made unto them: for nothing can more advance Trade, or raise a better Nursery of Sea-men.</P>
<P>Their Buildings are Splen∣did and Magnificent. In many places, as in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> the Foundations of their Houses cost more then the Superstru∣cture; for the Ground being low and spungy, they are con∣strain'd to ram in huge stakes of
<PB REF="11"/> Timber till they come to a firm Basis; so that one said, Whoso∣ever could see <HI>Amsterdam</HI> un∣der Ground, should see a huge Winter-Forest.</P>
<P>But of these, as of their more Ancient and Noble Families, the Famous Men of their Coun∣tries for Learning and Ex∣ploits of War, their rare Mo∣numents and other admirable Rarities to be found amongst them, with many other remark∣ables, which for thy more am∣ple satisfaction I shall refer thee to the following discourse, wherein our Author hath gravely and judiciously with singular method and brevity
<PB REF="12"/> set each memorable particular to thy View, in which thou wilt meet with many Occurrences worthy of thy admiration; having not only equall'd the best of such Writers as have hitherto treated on this Sub∣ject, but far out-done them all: And therefore I shall no ways doubt of thy candid Interpre∣tation of this his very lauda∣ble and worthy Enterprize; assuring thee that thy friendly reception of these his present Labours, will strongly invite him to commend unto thy judi∣cious consideration another Political Discourse, discove∣ring their Arts and Intrigues
<PB REF="12"/> by which they have attained to their Grandeur; a Book which will be of great concern and advantage to the English Nation.</P>
<P>Of the great pleasure and utility, and the excellent use that will be found in the seri∣ous perusal of Books of this kind, I shall need to say nothing, though I first principally in∣tended it, it being a truth so generally received amongst all Judicious Readers; only I shall tell thee, thou hast here <HI>Mag∣num in parvo,</HI> or <HI>Iliades in nuce,</HI> or the late High and Mighty States of the <HI>United Netherlands</HI> with all their
<PB REF="13"/> Provinces, brought thee even to thine own home: But I shall not inlarge, knowing <HI>Verbum Sapienti sat est.</HI></P>

<PB N="2" REF="14"/> and <HI>Champaigne,</HI> two <HI>French</HI> Provinces; upon the South-East with the Dukedom of <HI>Lorrain.</HI></P>

</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Rhine</HI> is divided about the confines of <HI>Gelderland</HI> into four Channels:</P>
<P>Of which the first is called the <HI>Wael,</HI> which running thorow <HI>Gelderland</HI> by <HI>Nimmegen</HI> and <HI>Bommel,</HI> loseth it self in the <HI>Maes.</HI></P>
<P>The Second, which keepeth the name of the <HI>Rhene,</HI> passeth by <HI>Arnhem;</HI> from thence in a contracted channel to <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> and so through <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The Third, called the <HI>Leck,</HI> taketh his course through the Provinces of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> and <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> and so into the Sea
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
'twixt <HI>Dort</HI> and <HI>Rotterdam.</HI></P>
<P>The Fourth, called the <HI>Yssel,</HI> passing by the Towns of <HI>Zut∣phen</HI> and <HI>Deventer,</HI> 'twixt <HI>Gel∣derland</HI> and <HI>Overyssel,</HI> empti∣eth it self into the <HI>South-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Maes</HI> runneth by <HI>Rure∣mond</HI> and <HI>Venlo,</HI> two known Towns of <HI>Gelderland;</HI> where turning towards the West, it takes in a part of the <HI>Rhene;</HI> and from thence passing to <HI>Maestricht,</HI> divides <HI>Brabant</HI> from <HI>Holland,</HI> watering the Town of <HI>Grave</HI> in the one, and of <HI>Dort</HI> in the other; and falls into the Sea not far from <HI>Brill.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ems,</HI> which divides the two <HI>Frieslands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Scaldis</HI> or <HI>Schelt,</HI> which a∣riseth in <HI>Picardy,</HI> and runs through <HI>Artois,</HI> and between <HI>Hainault</HI> and <HI>Brabant,</HI> meets with the Sea a little above <HI>Antwerp.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
<P><HI>Lis,</HI> or <HI>Ley,</HI> which runs through <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>Besides which Rivers, and o∣thers of inferiour note, here are great store of Lakes, Pooles, and Marishes, which do both fortifie the Country, and pro∣vide it of Fish.</P>
<P><HI>Belgium</HI> is divided into 17 Provinces:

<P>Of these 17 Provinces, only two did acknowledg the Sove∣raignty of the Kings of <HI>France, viz.

<P>Upon the eruption of the <HI>Gothish</HI> and <HI>Danish</HI> Nations, they here planting themselves in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> (as <HI>Adrianus Junius</HI> conceiveth) in reference to <HI>Zealand</HI> and <HI>Or∣land,</HI> two Islands in the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, out of which they came;
<PB N="7" REF="16"/> these two Provinces were cal∣led <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand.</HI> And with him agreeth <HI>William He∣da, Petrus Hannius, Scriverius,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>But <HI>Hugo Grotius</HI> will have it called <HI>Holland</HI> from <HI>Holtland,</HI> which is as much as to say, a Country of Wood, <HI>Holt</HI> sig∣nifies a Wood. And the An∣nals tell us, that heretofore <HI>Holland</HI> was full of Woods and Bushes.</P>
<P>This Country lies so low, that Ramparts only keep it from inundations, and restrain the Rivers within their bounds. In many places one may see the Sea far above the Land, and yet repuls'd with those Banks.</P>
<P>The compass of <HI>Holland</HI> is a∣bout 180 Miles, every part of it within three hours Journey of the Sea. The bredth is not above 24 Miles, and contains
<PB N="8" REF="17"/> 28 wall'd Towns or Cities, and 400 Villages; some scituate in <HI>North,</HI> and others in <HI>South-Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>North-Holland</HI> lies 'twixt the middle channel of the <HI>Rhene,</HI> and the <HI>Zuyder-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The Towns or Cities of most importance are <HI>Alcmaer,</HI> en∣compassed with deep Fens and Marshes, divers great Lakes, which are made by the Brooks which fall from the Downs; so it hath its name from these Lakes, the which in the <HI>Cym∣brian</HI> Tongue they call <HI>Meeren,</HI> as if they would say <HI>Almeer.</HI> It hath the first Place and the first Voice in the Estates of the said Provinces. It's Eminent for the Defeat the Inhabitants gave the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> meerly because he had left them no way to escape. It's a Town well fortified with goodly
<PB N="9" REF="17"/> Ditches and mighty Walls, Flanck'd with nine great Bul∣warks, which were made after the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had besieged it. It's three Leagues distant from <HI>Horn.</HI> Near unto it is the strong Castle of <HI>Astenburg. Anno</HI> 1328 it was burnt. The <HI>Frieslanders</HI> have often besieged it: and in the year 1517, it was taken and plundered for eight days by those of <HI>Guelders.</HI></P>
<P>Earl <HI>Florence</HI> the Fifth made a Ditch to the very extremities of the Country, to hinder the <HI>Frieslanders</HI> incursions.</P>
<P>It's not only one of the chiefest Towns of <HI>Holland,</HI> but of all the Low Countries, for the beauty of its Buildings, and the neatness of its Streets. Near this Town is <HI>Seayne,</HI> a great Village. The Lords hereof are descended from the House of <HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>

<P>Is scituated on the Gulf cal∣led the <HI>Fie,</HI> and the Ditch or Channel call'd <HI>Amstel;</HI> whence it hath the name of <HI>Amsteldam,</HI> in Latine <HI>Amstelo∣damum;</HI> built upon Piles like <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>It consisted at the first of a few Fishermens houses, and was under the Jurisdiction of the Lords of <HI>Amstel.</HI> About 300 years since, <HI>Gilbert Amstel</HI> for∣tified this City with Bulwarks and Towers; which being burnt by ill Neighbours, 'twas walled about <HI>Anno</HI> 1482.</P>
<P>And afterwards 'twas inlar∣ged, and it is now become one of the greatest Mart-towns in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Here a 1000 Ships of all sorts have been seen to go out and in.</P>
<P>They of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> made a great present of Money to the
<PB N="11" REF="18"/> Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> the First of that name; for the which, and other their good Services, he granted them leave to bear an Imperial Crown upon the Arms of the City: a Dignity never granted to any Town before.</P>
<P>There is yet to be seen in a Glass-window of the old Church, certain Purses painted with their Mouths down, scat∣tering Gold and Silver, to sig∣nifie their liberality.</P>
<P>It's strong by reason of the Scituation, but stronger by Art. It's flanck'd about with great Bulwarks, which answer∣ing one another, make it im∣pregnable. What with the Walls about it, and the indu∣stry of man, it's warranted to∣wards the Sea, with a long dou∣ble Pallisadoe from th'east to to the West; in which above
<PB N="12" REF="19"/> 1000 Ships, and innumerable lesser Vessels, may safely lie out of danger.</P>
<P>By reason of Trade, it's grown exceeding rich, by di∣verting it from <HI>Antwerp</HI> hither.</P>
<P>It's inhabited by People of all Nations, and of all Religi∣ons, and those nor tolerated or conniv'd at in private, but openly and freely exercis'd without any disl ke.</P>
<P>It's seven Leagues from <HI>Ley∣den.</HI></P>
<P>The Town-house is the pro∣digie of the world, and a mira∣cle beyond the Seven that An∣tiquity brags so much of; the Foundation of which cost ma∣ny hundred thousand pounds.</P>
<P>The Revenue of this City cometh to above 4000 <HI>l.</HI> a day.</P>
<P>Near St. <HI>Katharin</HI>'s Church, are laid the Foundations of a Tower, which is to be exceed∣ing
<PB N="13" REF="19"/> high: 6300 great Trees have been driven into a piece of ground of about 100 Foot square, to be Piles for the foun∣dation of the said Tower.</P>
<P>They have here a House of Correction, called the <HI>Tutcht∣huyse,</HI> for vain, idle, and extra∣vagant persons, and also for those children which will not be obedient to their Parents: at the coming in, there are two Lyons upon the doors bridled, as an emblem of the wild youth of the Town. They make them here work according to their offences. If they refuse to work, they are put into a low Cellar, and water is let in upon them: if they will stand still, they may; if they will pump, and deliver themselves, then they are help'd out again. They come out of this House, when they give Testimony of their repentance.</P>

<P>On the Lake called <HI>Harlem∣meer.</HI> It's a Noble Town, both for the largeness of the City, the fairness of the Houses, and pleasantness of the Scituation, being seated a∣mongst many goodly Mea∣dows: famous for the inven∣tion of Printing, invented here by <HI>Laurence Jans.</HI> The first Book that ever was Printed be∣ing <HI>Tullies Offices.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1245, Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> at the Councel of <HI>Lions</HI> made St. <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and

In memory of which, the Empe∣rour gave the Town for Arms (which before was a dry tree) a Sword compass'd with six stars; to the which the Patriarch of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> added upon the point a Cross Pattee. They have many silver Bells, which they brought from thence, hang up in their Steeple.</P>
<P>It hath the fairest Church in all <HI>Holland,</HI> being supported with great Columns or Pillars.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Sparr</HI> passeth through this Town.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1572, 'twas greatly afflicted by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ly∣ing before it eight moneths, to their great loss, and dis∣charged 10256 Cannon shot a∣gainst the Town; yet in the end, by reason of Famine, it was constrained to yield to the mercy of Duke <HI>d'Alva,</HI> who put them to the Sword: the Papists crying they were <HI>Ca∣tholiques,</HI> expecting to receive mercy at his hands; but they were answered, that it was good for their Souls, but their Bodies must die for the King.</P>
<P>This Town and Castle was built by the <HI>Harmelois,</HI> who issued from the bloud of the Kings of <HI>Friesland,</HI> and from thence it took its name, as the learned <HI>Adrianus Junius</HI> con∣ceiveth. It's the second Town in <HI>Holland</HI> for Rank and Dig∣nity.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
<P>The Castle hereof was seated upon the Chanel that runs to∣wards <HI>Egmont,</HI> not far from <HI>Heemskirk▪</HI> and built of Brick; but at this day there is nothing to be seen but the ruines of it.</P>
<P>The Lord of this place by his cruelty having made himself odi∣ous to his people, he and his wife fled into this Castle, and being besieged, and reduced to want for Provision, (having no means to escape) was compelled to enter into a Treaty for the rendition of the Town: his wife amongst o∣ther Articles capitulated that she might have so much of her most precious Goods as she could carry at one time: which was granted. She (with the help of her Maid) carried out her Husband lock'd in a Chest out of the Castle, leav∣ing all her Rings and Jewels be∣hind her. A rare Example of conjugal Love! It's desir'd that

<P>After a years Siege by the Bi∣shop, the City was taken, and
<PB N="36" REF="31"/> this King and his Councellor <HI>Knipperdoling</HI> were put into two Cages of Iron, and hung out of a high Tower, where they ended their most miserable lives and reign. A just reward for Rebels.</P>
<P>The town consisteth of 41 I∣slands, to which they pass partly by Boats, and partly by Bridges, whereof there are 144, and of them an Hundred and four built with Stone.

<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1574 it held out a gallant Siege; and at last the Enemies were enforc'd by the overflowing of the waters to raise their Siege, though the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had built 30 Forts to famish it; and there died about 7000 Persons in the town of Famine and Pestilence;
<PB N="37" REF="31"/> which made a great confusion in the town, insomuch as the people came in great multitudes to <HI>Peter Adrianson</HI> the Burgermaster, de∣claring their misery and want, and using many threatning words that he might agree with the E∣nemy: but he answered them, and said, <HI>My beloved Fellow Ci∣tizens, I have made an Oath, which I mean by the grace of God con∣stantly to keep: If my death, sith I must die, may any ways profit you, it's all one to me, whether you or the Enemy kill me: and therefore if this Carkass of mine will do you any good, in Gods Name take it, cut it in pieces, and divide it a∣mongst you, as far as it may possi∣bly stretch; for I shall be contented therewith.</HI></P>
<P>The Citizens were so amazed at his answer, as that they all went away without any more words.</P>

<P>But certain the deliverance of this Town can be attributed to none but to God Almighty; for though the Prince did use all means by breaking of Ditches, drawing up of Sluces, and drown∣ing all the Country almost to the Town, yet the waters were not so deep as to carry Boats, until God sent a strong South-west-winde, which drave the Sea into the Rivers and Land, that great Boats pass'd afloat and victuall'd the Town: and two days after it was victuall'd, came so strong a North-west-winde, that beat back the Sea again from whence it came; as doth appear in the Hi∣story of the <HI>Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Balder</HI> General for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> when he raised the Siege, left in his Lodgings the Town of <HI>Leyden</HI> pictur'd with her Royal Ways, Paths, and Chanels of Water, and in such manner
<PB N="39" REF="32"/> as they were guarded and de∣fended with Forts: and under the Picture was written: <Q><L>Vale Civitas, valete Castella parva, quia</L>
<L>Relict a est is propter aquam, &amp; non per vim inimicarum.</L></Q></P>
<P>They of <HI>Leyden</HI> had a perfect hatred against the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and therefore a <HI>Zealander</HI> being in the Town, and having shot a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> he rip'd him open, pluck'd his heart out of his body, as he was half dead; and when he had knawn it with his teeth, he cast it away from him: this knawn heart was afterwards seen in <HI>Delph</HI> by many credible people, and the very print of his teeth in it, as it's delivered to us by good Authority.</P>
<P>The Fort <HI>Waddinghe,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had made against the town, did much annoy the
<PB N="40" REF="33"/> townesmen; whereupon they issu'd out, and took the Fort, and roasted the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in it a∣live, though they cry'd out very lamentably, <HI>Misericordia, mise∣ricordia.</HI></P>
<P>They here printed Paper-coyn; on the one side, <HI>Haec libertatis ergo;</HI> on th'other side, <HI>Godt be∣hoed Leyden.</HI></P>
<P>Some of them wore about them in a silver Crescent these words: <HI>Rather the</HI> Turk <HI>then a</HI> Spaniard; <HI>because the</HI> Turk <HI>paying his Tri∣bute gives Liberty of Conscience, but the</HI> Spaniard <HI>none.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot forget one memorable Passage at this Siege. An <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Gentleman here had in a Sal∣ley his right Arm shot off with a Cannon-Bullet; he took it up, and carried it along with him unto his Chyrurgeon at his lodg∣ing, where without being sick or distempered, he held it in his left
<PB N="41" REF="33"/> hand, saying; <HI>This is the Arm which to day at Dinner serv'd the whole Body.</HI></P>
<P>There is a memorable Story, if true, which we have read in several eminent Authors; which is thus: <HI>Anno</HI> 1316 there hap'ning a great Famine, a poor Woman went to her own Sister that was very rich, to borrow a Loaf of Bread to save her and her Chil∣dren from starving: her Sister de∣nied that she had any in the house: she insisted that she had: whereupon her rich Sister fell a cursing and swearing, <HI>praying God that if she had any, it might be turn'd into a Stone:</HI> which God miraculously suffer'd to be done, as it's said, to the confusion of this pitiless and wretched Woman. In St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church in the same City, there is one of these Loaves safely kept to this day in a place iron'd about, for a perpetual re∣membrance
<PB N="42" REF="34"/> of the strangeness of this accident.</P>
<P>But <HI>Anno</HI> 1575 this Town be∣ing delivered of its long and ca∣lamitous Siege, an University was here Founded, in recom∣pence of their great sufferings.</P>
<P>The chief Towns within the Territories of <HI>Leyden,</HI> are, 1 <HI>Rins∣burgh,</HI> anciently a well-Fortifi'd town within a League of it. 2 <HI>Nortvies</HI> within a Mile of the Sea, and two Leagues of <HI>Leyden.</HI> 3 <HI>Valkenbourgh,</HI> where every <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> is kept a Horse-fair.

<P>Here is a Hospital for poor Passengers and decay'd old Peo∣ple, and also for Orphans, a Noble Building: In it are ordi∣narily 500 Children, who are taught to read and write, and bound Apprentices as they grow up.</P>
<P>Their Charity here is very great; if any be overburden'd with Children, or undone by ac∣cident, they go to the Masters of the Poor, and receive Relief according to their necessities. The number within this City which receive Charity, amounts ordi∣narily to 20000.</P>

<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1522 he was chosen Pope, and being in <HI>Spain,</HI> he receiving the news thereof, he made no shew of joy; being anointed, he would not change his name. He liv'd but 20 moneths and some days after, in continual trouble and grief of minde.</P>
<P>His Epitaph was: <HI>Hadrianus Sextus hic situs est, qui nihil sibi infelicius in vita duxit, quam quod imperaret.</HI></P>
<P>The Estate of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> was so great anciently, that the Bishop
<PB N="81" REF="53"/> or Prince thereof could come into the Field with 40000 armed Men of his own Subjects, and maintain them.</P>
<P>But the Bishop being envi'd for his great Revenues, and for that the Duke of <HI>Gelders</HI> made conti∣nual War upon him, He <HI>Anno</HI> 1522 resign'd the Temporalities thereof to the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, as Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> that he might have the protection of so great a Monarch to defend him and his Subjects from their Ene∣mies, and to the end he might quietly enjoy his Ecclesiastical E∣state. Which Donation was af∣terwards confirm'd by the Pope, and his Subjects did then Homage to him as Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Holland:</HI> and the Bishop did finely discharge them of their Oath which they had made to him. Of which Estate of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="54"/> the Emperour made two Pro∣vinces; that is to say, of <HI>Overyssel</HI> and <HI>Ʋtrecht;</HI> which make the number of 17 Provinces in the <HI>Netherlands.</HI></P>
