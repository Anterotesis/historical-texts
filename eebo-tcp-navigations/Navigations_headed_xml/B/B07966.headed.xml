<P>The opinion of taking <HI>Bergen</HI> is diuers, some thinke within two Monthes, others not in a yeare, &amp; some suppose it will neuer be taken in.</P>
<P>Some that came thence with Conuoy af∣firme that 3. dayes past, this side shot through the Church as they Preached and did much hurt, which was done vpon this occasion. That whereas this side lost many men, in seeking to take in the Sconce or halfe Moone, and that in the same place, the other side lost diuers men also, a Truce was made in the said place, for each side to fetch their Dead from thence: But when this side came to fetch theirs, the other side shot at them, which they did in regard that some of this side did vndermine in the meane time in that Quarter or place, while the other came and fetcht their Dead.</P>

<P> A Post newly arriued here in <HI>London</HI> on Fry∣day night last, being the 23. of August, brings certaine newes, That comming from the <HI>Palati∣nate</HI> towards <HI>England,</HI> as hee passed thorow <HI>Bra∣bant,</HI> he came thorow <HI>Mansfields</HI> Army, lying on this side <HI>Bruxels,</HI> not farre from the same place which <HI>Graue Henricke</HI> of <HI>Nassau</HI> inuaded lately: here hee saw <HI>Mansfield</HI> with seuen or eight thou∣sand horse, burne and spoyle the Countrey ex∣ceedingly: but still where hee commeth, hee first sheweth them this courtesie, that those Cities, Townes. Villages, or any rich particular Gentle∣men, or any others, that will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ansome themselues and goods vpon reasonable summes, he lets them rest quietly: but contrariwise, those that will not, he giueth the ordinarie spoyle to his souldiers, and hee taketh most of the coyne to himselfe.</P>
<P>Likewise here was then newes, that <HI>Gonzales</HI> comming towards him with great speed, being sent for by the Arch-Duchesse, hee is almost al∣readie there, so that there will be shortly some great bickering betweene them: this is certaine, that <HI>Mansfield</HI> was in treatie with the <HI>French</HI> King, but it was alwayes thought his end was, but to get some opportunitie; which now is come to light. It is thought, hee will take the spoyle of the Countrey, before <HI>Gonzales</HI> com∣meth, or any resistance can be made against him, hee alreadie hath obtained great summes of mo∣ney: all his footmen he hath left with the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> a little beyond <HI>Bruxels.</HI> This in∣cursion
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> made vpon <HI>Brabant,</HI> if <HI>Gon∣zales</HI> commeth not the sooner, must of necessitie either make the Marquesse <HI>Spinola</HI> suddenly re∣moue his siege from <HI>Bergen vp Zome,</HI> or other∣wise enforce <HI>Graue Henrick Vandenberg</HI> to leaue the frontiers of <HI>Gilderland,</HI> who now lyeth about <HI>Wesel:</HI> so by this meanes the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who is constrayned now to attend him, and to keepe all those Forces in a manner idle for the safetie of his Countrey, may then put those For∣ces to a better vse.</P>
<P>Concerning the Marriage of the Emperour: First, his Imperiall Maiestie and the Empresse going vnto the Church of the Franciscane Fryers, they were accompanied by diuers Am∣bassadors, besides the Nuncio of the Pope, and diuers Lords and Ladies walking all in very good order: After many of them followed the Marshall, who carried the Sword before the Em∣perour, who being arrayed in in an Imperiall ha∣bit, was adorned with his Crowne, and had his Scepter in his right hand, and the Globe of the Empire in his left. Before the Empresse, who followed them close, went the <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Hun∣garie,</HI> with the Crowne of the said Kingdome, the Lord <HI>Esterhasie</HI> with the Scepter, the Lord <HI>Setsy</HI> with the Globe of the Kingdome afore∣said, besides a Bishop, who carryed her Maiesties Crowne: The Ladies of the Court, and the Maids of Honour, being all richly attyred,
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>and adorned with precious Stones, came imme∣diately after.</P>
<P>Secondly, as soone as both Maiesties were en∣tred into the Church, they kneeled downe be∣fore the high or principall Altar. Whereupon the Arch-bishop holding a Booke before his Maiestie, hee continued his Prayers for a while, being still adorned with his Habite, Crowne, Scepter, and Globe aforesaid. And from thence he went to the Quire (where a Seat was prepared for him) kneeling there likewise downe. But the Empresse remayned still kneeling vpon the first place; where, at the beginning of the Seruice, were diuerse Ceremonies vsed, and Musicke heard: afterwards the Epistle being read, the great Letanie was sung; during which, shee lay with her face downewards vpon two pillowes of Cloth of Gold, before the Altar aforesaid. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>e ended, the Lord Arch-bishop anoynted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er before shee rose, betwixt her elbow and hand, as likewise her cheekes.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the Ceremonies being finished, the Empresse went away, being conducted by her Steward, the Lord of <HI>Didrichstain,</HI> besides o∣ther Lords, as likewise her shee Steward, the Countesse of <HI>Portia,</HI> and diuerse Ladies of her Chamber: But shee came presently backe to the Altar, arrayed in Cloth of Siluer, being adorned also with a rich Chaine and a Medall. Before her went the Lord <HI>Setsy,</HI> with the Globe of the King∣dome of <HI>Hungarie;</HI> the Lord <HI>Esterhasie</HI> with the
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>Scepter, and the <HI>Palatine</HI> aforesaid with the <HI>Hun∣garian</HI> Crowne: shee followed them with her owne Crowne, being set vpon her head by ano∣ther <HI>Hungarian</HI> Bishop, which is very richly ador∣ned with Pearles and precious Stones, and very artificially made. Afterwards, the Lord <HI>Esterhasie</HI> gaue the Archbishop the Scepter, the Lord <HI>Setsy</HI> the Globe, the <HI>Palatine</HI> the Crowne; and he gaue her Maiestie the Scepter in her left hand, the Globe in the right, and the Crowne hee set vpon her right shoulder, and during the time that the Angelicall Salutation was sung, shee kept the same: afterwards they were taken from her a∣gaine, and layd vpon the Altar; whereupon was sung <HI>Te Deum laudamus,</HI> and the Empresse hauing her owne Crowne vpon her head, and the <HI>Hun∣garian</HI> Scepter in her right hand, and the Globe in her left, was conducted to her ordinarie Seat in the middle of the Quire, where a <HI>Theatrum</HI> was erected, and adorned with rich Tapistrie and Hangings of Cloth of Gold. At the left hand his Maiestie continuing kneeling in his prayers, without changing his Imperiall habite, the Marshall aforesaid kept his Sword, and two other Lords the Globe of the Empire, and the Scepter. The Ceremonies, besides the vsuall Rites and Customes finished, the Emperour and Empresse were conducted backe to the Pallace by the Lords aforesaid, both Spirituall and Tem∣porall, as well <HI>Hungarian</HI> as <HI>German,</HI> besides the Ladies, their Maiesties being both still attyred in
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>their habites, and their traine going in good or∣der, as before: where there was prepared a state∣ly Banquet for all these Guests, as well <HI>Hungar iuns</HI> as <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>During the Coronation, a Citizen, who clombe vpon the Crosse of the Steeple of the Church aforesaid, flourished an Ensigne, stan∣ding vpon the same without falling, and the same was likewise afterwards done by diuers <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Hungarians;</HI> and amongst them, a <HI>German</HI> Souldier put all his clothes from his backe vnto his shirt, being vpon the same.</P>
<P>The Emperour, with the Empresse, sate first downe at the Table: at the right hand tooke the Popes <HI>Nuncio</HI> place; after him, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Em∣bassadour; then, the Embassadour of <HI>Mantua,</HI> at the left hand; besides the Archbishop of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and the <HI>Palatine</HI> aforesaid. At this Banquet were diuers <HI>Hungarian</HI> Lords atten∣ding; and amongst other the Lord <HI>Esterhasi,</HI> the Lord <HI>Setsy,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Achot.</HI> The Ban∣quet being ended, they went to the Councell-House of the Towne; where, in the presence of both Maiesties aforesaid, and the most part of the principall Lords of <HI>Hungarie</HI> and <HI>Germanie,</HI> besides the Ladies of both Nations, was for the space of seuen houres great reuelling and dancing, with much ioy, and great respect performed.</P>
