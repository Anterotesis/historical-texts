<HEAD>AN ELEGY ON Captain William Harman, Late Commander of His Majesties Ship <HI>Guernsey.</HI> Occasioned by a former Copy of Verses on the same Subject.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Has't Thou for this, by thy calm valour, taught</L>
<L>How Young men can fight, and how Old men ought?</L>
<L>Is this the guerdon of the Stout, and Brave?</L>
<L>Are these the Flow'rs strew'd on thy Watry Grave?</L>
<L>Must we confess, to th' honour of <HI>Argier,</HI></L>
<L>Thou 'wer't Kill'd ith' <HI>Streights,</HI> but thou wer't Murder'd here?</L>
<L>Dear Sir, could I as well acquainted be</L>
<L>With thy bless'd Ghost, as once I was with Thee,</L>
<L>Thou would'st (what thou did'st never yet,) complain,</L>
<L>That thou wer't now by Goose-shot basely slain.</L>
<L>Thou, who so oft, when Bullet, Ball, and Fire</L>
<L>Did joyntly, to thy ruine, all conspire,</L>
<L>Stood'st on the Billowes, as on Native Ground,</L>
<L>Fix'd like the Poles, when all the World turn'd round.</L>
<L>Thy Father's Courage was so tri'd and known,</L>
<L>'Twas fit to be bequeath'd to Thee alone.</L>
<L>Valour in Thee would scarce for Vertue go,</L>
<L>(For <HI>Harman</HI>'s Son must like a <HI>Harman</HI> do:)</L>
<L>Had not thy Brain commanded still thy Heart,</L>
<L>Improving Nature by well-measur'd Art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This the brave <HI>Sprag</HI> foresaw, when Thee he chose</L>
<L>To run the Gauntlet, through 'our then <HI>Belgic</HI> foes:</L>
<L>When the disabled <HI>Cambridge</HI> breathless lay;</L>
<L>Though (like a Stag imbauch'd) she stood at Bay,</L>
<L>Till Thou Her, as <HI>Aeneas</HI> did his Sire,</L>
<L>Brought'st nobly off, and spitd'st out all their Fire.</L>
<L>At Eighteen to so high a pitch to soar,</L>
<L>Had bin a mir'acle, were not <HI>Harman</HI> More.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>— But did not I a Poetaster blame?</L>
<L>And am I not my self become the same?</L>
<L>Pardon, dear Friend, if Sorrow make me mad:</L>
<L>Men know not what they say, when they are throughly sad.</L>
<L>Take but a parting Tear—But why on Thee</L>
<L>Are Drops bestow'd, when cover'd with a Sea?</L>
<L>Yet Thou wer't so belov'd, that had the Shore</L>
<L>Receiv'd thy Corps, thou'had'st bin intomb'd in More.</L>
<L>For though thy Courage did the Stoutest awe,</L>
<L>Thy Gen'erous Mildness equally gave law.</L>
<L>Thy 'obliging temper with it's potent charms</L>
<L>Vi'ed conquests ev'en with Thy victorious arms.</L>
<L>Nor Friend, nor Foe thy 'unbounded power controuls;</L>
<L>Thou 'or'ecom'st Their Forces, and inslav'st Our Souls.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Valour, Art, and Prudence could command</L>
<L>Was still perform'd by Thy successfull hand:</L>
<L>And when resistless Fate thy Foe appear'd,</L>
<L>Though ne'r so pow'erfull, yet she was not fear'd.</L>
<L>Nay though her Pow'er has plac'd her among the Gods,</L>
<L>She dar'ed not to attacque Thee, but with Odds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Methinks I see the Great <HI>Leviathan</HI> fly</L>
<L>With winged hunger to devour the fry:</L>
<L>Sure of her Prey, she sports upon the Main,</L>
<L>And hugs the thought of what she ne'r shall gain.</L>
<L>A greater Rage the <HI>Guernsey</HI> does inspire,</L>
<L>She spreads her Sails, and fills them with her Fire:</L>
<L>Only complains One single Ship to meet;</L>
<L>Shee, and her Captain, us'd to 'ingage a Fleet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They stand not long at distance to dispute,</L>
<L>But with warm breath each other's sides falute.</L>
<L>The' insulting <HI>Turk</HI> with Bulk and Numbers swell'd</L>
<L>The <HI>English</HI> Valour not by Monsters quell'd.</L>
<L>The Infidel twice seiz'd the Noble Prey:</L>
<L>Twice from her rave'nous jaws she's snatch'd away.</L>
<L><HI>English</HI> ne'r lose what they 'are resolv'd to save:</L>
<L>Nor can the Bulky over-pow'er the Brave.</L>
<L>This <HI>Harman</HI> sees and does; with his bold Hand</L>
<L>Example gives: with his wise Head, Command.</L>
<L>'Midst his own wounds he makes the rest secure:</L>
<L>His Courage keeps them Stout, his Conduct Sure.</L>
<L>And though the Shot thrice pierce his valiant breast,</L>
<L>The Soul, he's losing, he imparts to th' rest.</L>
<L>A Soul so active, and diffus'edly great,</L>
<L>'Twould serve, alone, to animate a Fleet;</L>
<L>And 'spight of all <HI>Argier,</HI> command the Main;</L>
<L>'Twould quickly 'have brought their <HI>Cressent</HI> to her wane.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor will we now thy Death Misfortune call:</L>
<L>He never bravely stands, that fears to fall.</L>
<L>Shall we bewail that man, who 'has lost his blood</L>
<L>In his King's Favour, for his Countrey's Good?</L>
<L>No, 'tis Our Selves that we commiserate,</L>
<L>Who are depriv'd by this thy early fate:</L>
<L>Thy early fate, which did designs defeat</L>
<L>As great as could be good, as good as great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Live then, bless'd Friend, thy life's remainder out</L>
<L>In the hearts of all that Loyal are, or Stout.</L>
<L>May our great <HI>Charles,</HI> revenge thy death, and all</L>
<L>Their Fleet a Victim to 'His just fury fall.</L>
<L>May <HI>Harmans</HI> daily from the Waves arise</L>
<L>To spread His Conquests through all Seas and Skies:</L>
<L>Till's Flag command, where'ere it doe's appear:</L>
<L>But may 'He ne're buy, ev'en Victory, so dear.</L>
</LG>
