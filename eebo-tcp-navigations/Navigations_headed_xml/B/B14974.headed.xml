<HEAD>From Rome the 6. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>FRom Ferrara, wee are certified that not long since, the Riuer of Adie, ouer flowed the bankes, and not on∣ly there, but in the land of Verona, drowned <HI>18.</HI> Villa∣ges, for which cause Cardinall <HI>Serra.</HI> Legat resident in Ferrara, hath taken good order, and specially hath staid a Ship with Torne, in the Hauen of Gero, to supply the said Prouince therewith.</P>
<P>From Naples they write, that vpon the <HI>21.</HI> of August, <HI>Philibert</HI> Prince of Sauoy arriued there with <HI>22.</HI> Gal∣lies, and was honorably receiued therein by the Vice-Roy, and Gentlemen of the Towne, and lodged in the Castle, that Marquesse <HI>Centrerione,</HI> a Genouesian, was also come thither with <HI>2.</HI> Gallies, to meete the Prince: where being in the Castle of <HI>Ouo,</HI> hee had a quarrell with <HI>2.</HI> Spanish souldiers, to whem he gaue two blowes on the eare, for the which he was committed to Prison, and by the Prince presently condemned to dye, but by the Vice-Roy and the Marques <HI>De S. Croce</HI> his life was begged, but yet condemned to be eight yeeres Prisoner, to pay <HI>10.</HI> thou∣sand Crownes for a fine, and his <HI>2.</HI> Gallies to serue <HI>2.</HI> yéeres in the Spanish Army, at his own cost and charges.</P>
<P>From Messina, we hears that betweene the sauldiers in the Tuscane and Neopolitane Gallies there rose a great controuersie, whereby they fought together, and ma∣ny staine on both sides, but at last by the Generall, Pre∣sennet they were appeased.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Venice the 13. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>FRom Constantinople it is written, that there is both a great plague and dearth in that City, that in the black Sea, the Turkes Gallies had taken <HI>6.</HI> Ships with Cos∣sockers, and made them all slaues, among them one was a Turke, that hath reuealed many secrets touching the Polish Army. That the great Turke hath payd his Souldiers <HI>3.</HI> millions of Gold: That the <HI>Vaywodo</HI> of Walachia is with the Turke, and that <HI>Radul Vaywode</HI> of Moldauia, is strangled by the Turkes commande∣ment, being charged to haue had intelligence with the King of Polonia.</P>
<P>At Genua there is a Ship arriued, with <HI>52</HI> Chests of siluer, &amp; there are <HI>3.</HI> more dayly expected to come thether.</P>
<P>From Milan, it is certified that there is <HI>54.</HI> thou∣sand crownes, sent from thence to Valtolina, to pay the souldiers, and for that the Grisons since their last enter∣prise out of Cleue, haue attempted nothing else. The rest of the Marshall <HI>Amunitian</HI> is stayed. From Spaine it is certified by <HI>Augustino Centrerione,</HI> and <HI>Francis Serra,</HI> there is <HI>300.</HI> thousand crownes, assigned to be paid for the Netherlands.</P>

<HEAD>From Chur in Switzerland, the 16 of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>MOunsier <HI>Montallon,</HI> the French Ambassadour, per∣ceiuing that the confederated quarters would no longer be delayed of, but would with <HI>10.</HI> thousand men march vnto Valtolina to ayd their confederates, he prote∣sted against them, and told them that if they would take that enterprise in hand without the consent of his king, it would be cause of great hurt and trouble vnto them, but notwithstanding, séeing that the French king did not help them, nor yet would suffer them to be helpe, the countrey people were so much incenced, that they said, that seeing the French King persecuted those of the Religion in his owne Country, he was no better to bee trusted then the Spaniards, end that the Spanish enmyty was much more benefit vnto them then the French; and therefore there was <HI>1000.</HI> men sent out of Boetgow, and <HI>1000.</HI> men out of the Bunter, which went part into Munster, and some into Valtolina Valley, and they intend by all the meanes they can vse to bring these countries againe vnder their obedience, and there is a principall Couent Lord come thether from Valtolina, who saith, that this warre is not religious, but a country warre, and that the Spaniards, vnder the pretence of making peace, by the French ayd would bring the confederate townes &amp; parts vnder his yoke: As also that the oppressions done by the Spaniards, vnto those of Valtolina are so great, as they are insupportable, and therefore that hee came away, and that the Confederaies had neede to looke well vnto them∣selues, as hauing Committies for them, that meane them little good. They intend dayly to set vpon the enemy, therfore <HI>Leopaldus</HI> forces that are not payd, are disconten∣ted, and for that in Milain, there is <HI>2.</HI> millions of gold come, there must be something done, but yet the confede∣rated frontiers are well fortified with Garrisons, where the first exploit must bee done: for the country people are all fully agreed, with body, liues and goods, to ioyne toge∣ther, and haue sworne no longer to refraine from armes, and that if their neighbours will not willingly let them haue prouant and other things, they will haue it by force.</P>

<HEAD>From Vienna the 15. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>EIght dayes past the Hungarians thought suddenly to haue falne vpon our force in Schut, but were preuen∣ted, and were made to retire with losse of <HI>500.</HI> of their men, and many taken; and on the other side, the Hunga∣rians haue taken diuers of our Wagons, that went out for Forrage, and for that all our forces now lye by Pres∣burge, and in Shut. The Budianer Hungarians and Turkes come againe vpon vs, and runne in euery place, and once againe haue burnt <HI>20.</HI> Villages, and still goe for∣ward, hauing carried away <HI>2000.</HI> people, great and small, prisoners with them, besides great store of Cattle, and o∣ther things without any hinderance. What pitty is it in this City, wherein there are so many horse &amp; footemen rea∣ready armed, &amp; send no men out to rescue them, wherby ma∣ny poore might be relieued, in respect that the Hungari∣ans are but meane people, and not well armed, and yet are not resisted, it is strangely discourst on heere: the hurt they haue done wil not be repaired with the valew of <HI>100</HI> thousand Florens, therefore the common people are des∣perate, and neither spare friend nor foe, so also <HI>2.</HI> dayes since Bethlem Gabors Hungarians haue made a road in∣to Marauia, and spoyled all the Country, therefore Colo∣nell <HI>Walstein</HI> with his forces hath left the Marckt, and is forced to goe to Niclaesburge: to conclude, they haue shut vp the passages.</P>
<P>In the meane time there is a treaty of peace in Hand-hol∣den, at Rauensburge, in the Marckt and Committies, to that end on both fides come thether. The English Am∣bassador hath his dispatch of the Emperour, and hath had a great reward, but is referred to be at the Electorall mee∣ting. The Duke of Saxen in the Emperours name is to be president for him at that meeting, and the Arch Duke <HI>Charles</HI> rides thether: the Arch Duke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> is dayly expected here. The Budianers lie <HI>20.</HI> thousand strong by New sidler Sea, his greatest forces are Turkes, he hath a strange countenance, all Coure and other places are bur∣ned, and cannot be built vp againe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Breslaw, the 9. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>THe Silecian forces are now all gone towards the Frontiers of Morauia, and for that the Saxon for∣ces
<PB REF="2"/>haue begun to besiedge Glats, yesterday, and the day before all the Wagoners and Carmen are staid, to carry Ordnance and Munition out of this towne thether, by this meanes the Marquesse with his Hungarian &amp; Tur∣kish ayd will be drawne hether.</P>

<P>Yesterday an English Ambassador came hether from Creutsnach, through the Bergstrate, to goe to Vianna, and went through the Spanish army, with <HI>2.</HI> cornets of Horsemen, ouer the Ship bridge at Stein, to the Pals∣graues army.</P>
<P><HI>Don Cordoua,</HI> intends to hold his Winter leaguer betwéene Stein and Hedleberg, in the Bergs trate. The Earle of Douerlach hath sent some Souldiers into the Palatine league, and although there was an intent that there should be some forces laid about Strasburge, wher∣by the Palatine could not come vpward: at a meeting holden at Hagenaw it was agreeed, that euery place should defend their passages as well as they could.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Amberg the 22. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>WEe vnderstand the Earle of Mansfield is broken vp with all his forces, and gone into Bauaria, to set vpon the Bauarian army that lies before Cam, and hath lest <HI>4.</HI> companies of the country people in the Scouts, as also Mounsier <HI>Rilly,</HI> and many more.</P>
<P>Aduice comes now, that the Duke of Bauaria hath gi∣nen two assaults to Cam, with the losse of <HI>400.</HI> of his men. The Garrison in the Towne hold out brauely, but it is sayd, that the Duke (with losse of many men on both sides) should haue taken it. The <HI>Lantgraue</HI> is brought Prisoner hether, and this day is carried to Ho∣burgh.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Ambergh the 16. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>NEwes comming hether, that by a Bauarian Post, that certaine thousand Bauarian Souldiers were come to the Langraue of Leichtenburg, to lye in prefer∣men, Wareberg and Schindthutten, to shut the passage that way from Mansfield.

The Lantgraue himselfe being taken, was kept Prisoner in his Castle: and for that is certified for truth, that the Duke of Bauaria hath broken vp his Campe before Stranbingen, and with all his forces is gone backe to Cain, and hath taken Artischwang, <HI>2.</HI> miles scom thence, but the Earle of Mansfield hath not onely sent <HI>4.</HI> compa∣nies of footemen to Cam, but determineth also to breake vp his Campe and goe thether, in the meane time leauing the Sconses strongly Garrisoned, and dayly hée expects great store of horse and footemen to come to him, vnder the command of the young Duke of Brumswicke, and a Duke of Saxon. Mounsier <HI>Tilly</HI> also will breake vp. It stands but hardly heere with the vpper Palatinate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for that the Subiects thereof, by reasons they are dayly so much pild and pold, and were much oppressed by the Earle of Mansfields Souldiers, specially his Horsemen, they are much discontented, and are of opinion that they shall bée better protected and defended, or at least receiue lesse da∣mage then they doe.</P>
