<HEAD>To the Right Reverend and Illustrious, CARDINAL <HI>de</HI> MONTE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE horrible fierce Discordances, and intestine Civil Wars of Christian Princes, had reduc'd me (most noble Cardinal) to this condition, That being despoyl'd and plundered of all Estate, bound in Chains, and haled thorow the Moun∣tainous &amp; dangerous Passages
<PB REF="3"/>of <HI>Thracia</HI> and lesser <HI>Asia,</HI> dragged about from place to place, like horse unto a Mar∣ket, I became seven times sold to the sundry and toylesome sorts of rustick labors; where under an heavy <HI>Turkish</HI> rod, &amp; sharper provocations, in hun∣ger and thirst, in cold and na∣kedness, exposed to all open∣ness of Airs, I was compell'd to attend the feeding Sheep, Goats, and all other sorts of Cattel, and oftentimes to ex∣ercise their discipline of war. For prevention therefore of a lasting misery, I endeavoured an escape; and wandering up and down, guided by the Nor∣thern
<PB REF="3"/>Pole, sustaining Life with Acorns, wilde herbs, and their bitter roots, sodden with a little salt, I spent my time in solitariness, amidst even ra∣vening Beasts; till at length, having fastned together some few Timber pieces with cords and wythes, I ventured to pass the Hellespontick Sea; but was retaken, and brought back again unto my Master; where tyed both hands and feet, and prostrated on the ground, I was most cruelly and severely scourged and threshed; and after, for the space of thirteen yeers, tossed and tumbled on the waves of
<PB REF="4"/>a sad and adverse fortune un∣der the Turkish Government. I endured and suffered many miseries, calamities, afflicti∣ons, and persecutions for my Religions sake.</P>
<P>But when I had found by sad exprience, that the for∣mer more compendious way through <HI>Thrace,</HI> could not free me from their Tyranny, and grievous Slavery, I resolv∣ed to steer another course by observation of the Southern Pole, to pass the Desarts and perillous places of <HI>Caramania</HI> and <HI>Syria:</HI> and so through many and various difficulties, I at length arrived in the holy
<PB REF="4"/>Land, and was received by the Brethren of Saint <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> inhabiting Mount <HI>Sion:</HI> from whence, after the refreshment of a yeer, as a man revived from death, (by God's Almighty providence) and as snatched from the claws of the hellish Dragon, &amp; freed from those cruel tor∣tures, I return'd home amongst my Christian Friends, a true witness of the Turkish cruel∣ties; that they with due repen∣tance for their sins and errors, might learn to avoid like cru∣cifyings and tortures; and likewise understand what high degree of hate those men
<PB REF="5"/>deserve, whose foul ambitions stop and hinder the employ∣ment of Christian swords from destructing and abolishing that Satanick-Turkish Go∣vernment, which may (by God's assistance) be the only preventor of our future mi∣series; and which hath been long-since, and propheti∣cally spoken of, both by Chri∣stians and Infidels.</P>
<P>Therefore having finished a large perambulation of the holy Land, and visited good part there of the <HI>West,</HI> and de∣scribed rudely the Tragedy of their cruelties, together with other circumstances of that
<PB REF="5"/>Government, all which I ga∣ther'd from daily conversati∣on, experience, &amp; long practise in Courts and Camps of the Turkish Emperour; and what more I could ever learn from ratiocinations with wise and experienced men, or by read∣ing, I committed stil to memo∣ry, and at several times &amp; stati∣ons, remitted them to writing, and made them after publick; which divers learned and so∣ber persons translated into their several Idiomes: which when I found, and perceived they might prove necessary, or somewhat useful, &amp; favour∣ably accepted by the Reader,
<PB REF="6"/>I recollected them, and bound them up into this little bun∣del, and have dedicated the whole unto your Grace, the best of Patrons, printed in this famous City, <HI>Rome,</HI> receptacle of all Natoins, to be difpersed to all Friends and Strangers.</P>
<P>Do you therefore by the ex∣ample of our Saviour Christ, who preferred the poor Wid∣dows mite, before the gifts of Princes, &amp; with that purchased the inheritance of immortali∣ty, favourably &amp; in good part accept of this poor oblation, from</P>

<HEAD>THE PILGRIM TO HIS Christian READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Once had fixed my intenti∣ons, (worthy Reader) that these my poor endeavours should come abroad (for your utility and pleasure) in a far comlier habit, cloathed with
<PB REF="7"/>augmentation of Arguments, and more p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>ed Expressions: but my poverty, and nakedness of necessary Implements, diverted all such thoughts, and stop'd my undertaking such a labour; wanting besides both time and place of fit retired∣ness for studious desires.</P>
<P>Sumptuous and smooth Garments, or Men well moneyed, have onely entrance into Princes Palaces, and great Mens Gates; that if n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w <HI>Homer</HI> should even himself otherwise appear, a rude and surly Porter thrusts him out of doors. And I confess in conscience, in this degenerate Age, men take more pleasure, spend more thoughts and money in scul∣pture, picture, hawking, hunting, and worser things, unnecessary, then in due observance of our Saviour Christ's exemplary divine moralities, then in the service and advancement of their Laws and Country, or relieving wants of distressed poor or Pilgrims, Do y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u not so, (good Christian Reader;)
<PB REF="7"/>but first in all humility, and reverence, obey, and worship your Great God, Cre∣ator, and Redeemer; next, be more careful to supply the needy and poor-Man, who is a Temple of Christ, an Habitation of the Holy Ghost: then, not onely love and study the prosperity of your Country, (which God exacts a∣bove all private interests) but love all good Supporters of your just Laws and liberties, and all true Patriots there∣in. And if you shall receive by this my pains, the least of delecta∣tion, impute it not to your well-wish∣ing PILGRIM, but the benignity and liberality of his noble PATRONS and BENEFACTORS: and where you finde Him pass the limits of Sobriety or Modesty, or to come short and flat in Elecution, let your great prudence and humanity correct Him; and be pleased to consider Him, to have spent the ablest and best portion of his time and Age, in rude and rustick ser∣vitudes,

<HEAD>The TRANSLATOR TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>HE that desires to move compassi∣on or such-like affections in o∣thers, must have some sympathy and natural inclination thereto himself. The perusal of this small Treatise, brought sadness to my thoughts, and tears into my eyes, even to a fellow-feel∣ing of the bitter and disastrous conditi∣on of Christian Captives. What heart so flinty, as to forbear lamenting for them? The rigid old opinion of some Stoicks, who fancied &amp; taught not be grieved at
<PB REF="9"/>any event, Not to be dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbed with dolency at any accident befals mortality, is a doctrine no way suitable to Christi∣anity. All man must be resigned, sur∣rendred, unman'd, and quite put off, if affections be taken from him. The sence and tenderness whereof, wrought me to this Translation: and remembred thereby, to praise and glorifie our good and gracious God, who hath preserved us from such calamities; and likewise hoping to encrease the number of re∣lenting mindes, and charitable disposi∣tions. My poverty and weak capacity, could finde no other means to be instru∣mental for them. Thick and dark clouds have eclipsed the warmth and comfort of the Sun from me: but, <HI>Be you merciful, as your heavenly Fa∣ther is merciful.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of their Oratories.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He fabricks of their Churches are suf∣ficiently large and sumptuous, and cal∣led by the name of <HI>Meschites:</HI> in which I never could perceive any sort of fancies or imageries (for Idolatry is held by them the worst of abominations)
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>but onely these, or one of these in∣scriptions following, in the Ara∣bick Language, <HI>There is no God but one, and Mahomet his Prophet;</HI> or, <HI>One Creator and Prophets equal:</HI> or, <HI>None is strong as God.</HI> Then there is seen a great abundance of burning Lamps, the whole Church whited, the Pavement covered with Mat∣tresses, and on them the Ornaments of Tapestries. Neer the Church, is erected a Tower of great height, to the top whereof the Priest as∣cends before the time of Prayers, and with a loud voice, his ears stopped with his fingers, he thrice proclaims these words; <HI>God, True, One:</HI> which Clamour or Outcry (for they have no Bells) being heard, the Nobility, and all unbu∣sied persons, repair to Church, as bound to that devotion. After∣wards the said Priest descending, prays with them; (and then they turn their faces towards <HI>Mecha:)</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>And this he is tyed to do by his Of∣fice, five times day and night. But whosoever cometh to these Pray∣ers, must wash his hands, his feet, and privities, and his head thrice sprinkled with water, and these words pronounced: <HI>Glory to my God.</HI> Then, their shooes put off, and left at the Church-door, they enter in, some bare-footed, others having new Shooes or Socks, and so ten∣derly touch the ground. Women come not into Churches, as being not excis'd, and for fear of disturb∣ing mens devotions; but meet a∣part in severed places, altogether shut off from eyes and ears of men; and more seldome frequent their Churches, except in time of Passe∣over, or Easter, and on Fridays; which days, from <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tra∣ditions, for distinction and imita∣tion, they almost respect as much as Jews their Sabbaths, or Christi∣ans the Lords day. They pray
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>from nine a clock at night till twelve; and in their praying, their bodies are ever in great motion and agitation, wherewith they marvelously afflict themselves, with loud cryings and fierce ejacu∣lations; so as oftentimes, their strengths and spirits failing, they sink unto the ground; and if it hap∣pen, any of them conceive her self with child, she then assures her self, that pregnancy proceeds from fa∣vour of the Holy Spirit; and when delivered, the Infants born are cal∣led, <HI>Sons,</HI> or <HI>Souls of the Holy Ghost.</HI> This hath been related to me from their Hand-maids; for I, nor ever any man else, were present at that spectacle. At mens devotions I have been often present with my Master; whose customes are in manner following: in their prayers they ne'er take off (their Turbants) coverings of their heads, but with the tops of their fingers gently
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>touch them, in token of taking them off; they fall upon their knees and often kiss the ground: they hold it for great wickedness, to have a Christian present at their mysteries; for they believe their Churches (as they say) to be polluted by men unwashed; and that Christians use not such Lavatories. Every Church in <HI>Turky</HI> hath a peculiar place for Baths and washings, with lodgings for a Priest. Now here the Priest ascends his Pulpit (reads a piece of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and sometimes expounds it) and there preaches a∣bout two hours; his Sermon end∣ed, two boyes come up to him, who pronounce their prayers singing with responsals; which Songs be∣ing ended, the Priest with the whole People in a low voice, beat∣ing upon their sides, repeat these words, <HI>There is but one God;</HI> which for the space of half an hour they do, and so depart. But this
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>manner of Prayers and Ceremonies of Preaching and singing, are not done every day, unless in time of Lent, Festivals, some Sundayes; and most observe the Fridayes for religious worship.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of their Lent.</HEAD>
<P>THey keep their Lent by fasting one Month and one Week e∣very Year; but not alwayes the same: for if this Year they fast out <HI>January,</HI> the next they fast out <HI>Fe∣bruary,</HI> and keep on that course; so as in twelve Years space, they de∣dicate to God (in lieu of tenths) one Year and twelve Weeks. Travel∣lers and sick Persons are excused from present fastings; but are in∣joyned to supply it, by fasting so many dayes at other times. When they fast, all that Day they taste nothing, not so much as Bread or Water; then the Stars appearing,
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>it is lawful for them to eat of all things which are not strangled, or Hoggs-flesh, which they esteem as carrion, most unclean. Their Lent being past, they observe <HI>Ea∣ster</HI> for three dayes, with great so∣lemnity, anoynting the Nails of their Feet and Fingers with an Oyl which they call <HI>Chna,</HI> which maker those Nails to shine like Gold; and with the same, they somtimes stain or colour the Hoofs and Tails of Horses. This Tincture holds very long, &amp; can hardly be wip'd away; so, as until new Nails thrust out the old, they still retain that dye: but Nails of the Hand, by frequent washing, abate in time. Women do not onely anoynt the Nails, but their whole Hands and Feet also with that Oyl.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<HEAD>Of their Circumcision.</HEAD>
<P>THey Circumcise not on the eighth day, as the <HI>Jews</HI> do, but when the new-born arrive at the age of seven or eight yeers, and be of perfect speech: the mystery whereof, is from the words of con∣fession required before circumcisi∣on, which are some of those sen∣tences afore-mentioned in their Churches, which they repeat, and give assent thereto, by hold∣ing up the Thumbe of the right-Hand. The Youth is not for this mystery brought unto their church, but is circumcised in his Parents House. I have been often present at this solemnity, which is per∣formed in manner following: first, the friends are all invited to a feast, sufficiently furnished with all sorts of delicate flesh, lawful for them to eat; and almost everywhere, espe∣cially
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>amongst the wealthier sort, an Ox is killed, bowelled, and flawed; in the body whereof, they include a Sheep; and in that Sheep, a Hen; and in her, an Egge; all which are entirely roasted toge∣ther, for the solemnity and splen∣dor of that day. Then in their Feast and time of Supper, the Boy that is to be circumcised, is brought to a Physitian skilful in that Art, who fixing between a pair of pinchers the fore-skin of his privie Member, to prevent all fear in the Boy, he telleth him, that the next day he will circumcise him, and so departs; but presently feigning to have omitted something appertain∣ing to this preparation, on a sudden he cuteth off the fore-skin, apply∣ing thereunto a little salt and bom∣bace; and then he is called a <HI>Mussel∣man,</HI> that is, one circumcised. Yet their Names are given the day of their Nativity, not Circumcision.
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>After continuance of this Feast for three dayes, the Boy with great pompe and solemnity is accompa∣nied to the Bathes; and being re∣turned to his House, he is brought before the Guests, and by them presented with gifts prepared for him; some give Silver, Silken Vestments; some, Silver Cups; others, Money; and sometimes, Horse. Women present him like∣wise, some, with Shirts, Hand∣kerchers, and such like, according to the several pleasures and abilities of the Guests. Women are not circumcised, onely they confess the aforesaid words, and so made <HI>Musselmen.</HI> And if any Christi∣an voluntarily confess a Faith in <HI>Mahomes,</HI> and suffers Circumcision, (which often happens, by the heavy yoke and burthen of their Tri∣bute) this Man is led through all the Streets and open places of the City, to the great joy and honour
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>of the people, with acclamations and ringing of Bells: him also they present with gifts, and after free him from all Tribute. For covetousness of this profit, many <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Albanes</HI> become cir∣cumcised. But if any be forced thereto, as he that shall strike or otherwise disgrace a <HI>Musselman,</HI> or blaspheme <HI>Mahomet,</HI> (as it befel a certain <HI>Grecian Bishop</HI> which I did see) that man is circumcised, and hath nothing presented to him, yet shall be freed from Tribute as o∣thers circumcised.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of their Priests.</HEAD>
<P>THeir great Musty (as the Pope among Catholiks) cannot erre, and is the highest Minister of all Religious and Lay Persons: an Officer of great power and trust: his conclusions and sentences in State and Church-affairs, are irre∣vocable;
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>and his person held in most esteem and reverence next the Emperour: his habit most in green, being <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s colour. There is small difference between their other Priests and Lay-men, nor much from the Governours of Ce∣remonies (such as our <HI>Bishops</HI> are) neither is much learning required from them: it is sufficient, if they can read the <HI>ALCORAN</HI> and <HI>MUSSAPH;</HI> yet they that can interpret on the Text, are e∣steemed most learned, because the Traditions of <HI>Mahomet</HI> are written in the <HI>Arabick,</HI> not vulgar <HI>Turkish</HI> Character; and they hold it for most detestable, to have them interpreted in the vulgar Lan∣guage. These Priests and Gover∣nours are elected by the People; but their rewards are stipends for their labours, and paid by the King. They have Wives, and Habits like Seculars: and if their
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>stipends be not sufficient to main∣tain the number of their Children, they otherwise supply themselves by Handicrafts, and Trades, or what else befits a Free-man; as teaching Schooles, transcribing Books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I ne'er could see a∣mongst them any Printers; but Paper is there very well made. Some make profit one way, some a∣nother, as Taylors, Shooe-makers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of their Monks.</HEAD>
<P>THey have likewise Monks of several Orders; but chiefly of these three: the first have no propriety in any thing, they go al∣most wholly naked, saving their privities covered with a Sheep's skin, and in cold weather they use the like to cover their backs; their sides, their feet and hands, are never covered. They beg alms as well
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>of Christians as Turks; and, <HI>For God's sake.</HI> These Monks having eaten an Herbe called <HI>Maslach,</HI> are possest with a kinde of fury and madness; they cut and wound their brests cross and overthwart, and so their arms, dissembling all trou∣ble or pain; then clap on their heads, hands, and brests, the spunge or mushrooms of old Trees light burning, and not remove them till they are reduced to ashes. Ano∣ther Order I have seen, who go with their privy part bor'd tho∣row, and a Ring included of the weight of three pound <HI>Troy</HI>-weight; and this to preserve chastity. The third Order is rarely seen abroad; but remain both day and night in Churches, where within some lit∣tle Angles they have small Cabins, no shooes, vestments; or coverings of the head, wearing nothing but one shirt; their exercise is fasts and prayers, that God would reveal
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>things future to them. With this sort of Monks, the King of Turks usually consults, when he in∣tends a motion or expedition to War.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Their reverence to <HI>Mahomet's</HI> Traditions.</HEAD>
<P>THey give so much respect to <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Traditions and Sta∣tutes, that, not onely they never blaspheme GOD or his Prophet; (which amongst us sometime hap∣pens) but if they finde the least leaf or scrowl thereof, lying on the ground, they take it up and often kiss it, and place it on some shelves or chinks of walls; affirming it a sin, to suffer that wherein the Name of God, and Laws of <HI>Maho∣met</HI> are written, to be trodden under foot. And no man dares to sell the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and other writings of their Law, to any <HI>Christian,</HI> or any
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>other differing in Religion or Faith with them, lest they should be trodden on, or touched with un∣clean hands: and whosoever should so do, is severely punished. And in this regard they may be stiled farre more reverent then <HI>Christi∣ans.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of their Schools.</HEAD>
<P>THey have places for Instructi∣on, and Teachers both of Men and Women: in several Towns, Men, the Boyes; and Wo∣men, the Girls: some teach Astro∣nomy, Physick; and some, the Art of Poetry; which when they do, they speak out with loud voyce; and moving their hands unto their sides, they pronounce their mean∣ings. They understand no artifi∣cial Musick; but frame verses to certain rules, which consist of ele∣ven sillables. The hotness of the
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>Clymate, &amp; often sicknesses, makes most inclined to Physick, wherein they have some small knowledge. They learn Astronomy, to be thought able to tell fortunes. Prin∣ting is supplied by a number of wri∣ting Priests; and perhaps neglected (as all learning is) to maintain the peoples ignorance, and keep them off from search into the gross ab∣surdities of their constrained Reli∣gion.</P>

<HEAD>Of Marriages.</HEAD>
<P>THey marry without Vowes or Oathes, take Wives without portions, and for the most part buy them; contrary to the Roman custome, where the Son in law was bought with Money to take a Daughter. This married Woman carries nothing with her for use or ornament, which she is not forced to redeem or purchase from her
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>Parents. Evil manners or sterility, are causes of Divorces; for which there is a peculiar Judge. They permit their bond-men or pur∣chased servants to marry; but the issue of them are all born slaves. The <HI>Alcoran</HI> perswadeth marriage, as pleasing God and Man; and it allows plurality of Wives and Concubines, as many as Man pleas∣eth. The Turk amongst his (where∣of he hath above five hundred in his Seraglio's) nameth her for his Wife or Sultana, by whom he hath his first-begotten Son. All their Wives are used with equality of respect, in diet, cloaths, returns, and what concerns them; and are most obedient to their Husbands. They nurse their own Children, and bear them on their Shoulders, not in their Arms: no men, but Eu∣nuchs, are suffered to be with them, not their own Sons, if a∣bove twelve years of age: they ne∣ver
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>go abroad, but accompanied with onely Women.</P>

<P>PIlgrims of several Nations tra∣vel to visit holy places, which the Turk possesseth; as <HI>Mecha</HI> and <HI>Medinum,</HI> (as Christians, <HI>Jerusalem</HI>) where they say <HI>Mahomet</HI> was buri∣ed; but this is done as well for gain and profit, as for devotion or Reli∣gions sake. And there having seen a gilded Shoo hanging from the roof of the Church, &amp; bought such fine linen and cloath as they please, they return home with great advantage; some carrying about the Streets, water, from thence, in glasses, for devotions sake, and freely give it to any that are thirsty; others, do the like for profit. And if any one of them happen to die in this Pil∣grimage, by what occasion soever, although he ne'er arrive neer <HI>Me∣cha,</HI>

<HEAD>Miracles done by <HI>Mahomet</HI> at <HI>Mecha,</HI> which, they say, he still doth in these times.</HEAD>
<P>I Know not whether I should call them Miracles, or rather Mon∣strous toyes, written in their book called <HI>Mehemedine,</HI> wherein they are perswaded, that when <HI>Mecha</HI> was a building, GOD, by the prayers of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> commanded divers moun∣tains to bring their stone to the Fa∣brick of that Church, every Hill his tenth: and when divers Moun∣tains had brought their portions, and <HI>Mecha</HI> built and perfectly com∣pleated, a certain Hill called <HI>Ara∣phat,</HI> and some other more remote, coming thither with their tenths somewhat too late, and finding <HI>Me∣cha</HI> built, and no use of their stones,
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>they began most bitterly to weep; which when <HI>Mahomet</HI> perceived Hills so distressed, and understood the cause, he said unto them, <HI>Be of good cheer, weep not, but store your tenths up in a place which I shall shew you; and whosoever shall not pray upon your stones, his pilgrimage shall be un∣profitable and unaccepted.</HI> And after so doing, <HI>Mahomet</HI> struck the stones with his foot, and there issued out Water, not useful to drink; and imposed a name, and called it, <HI>A water of purification,</HI> whereof every Pilgrim carrieth at his return, some portions thereof in vessels; and whenever any die, the vestures wherewith the body is to be co∣vered, are sprinkled with this water, for remission of their sins. And they further affirm, That no man can come to <HI>Mecha,</HI> whose visit is not known to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who reveals the persons to the Keepers there (all Eunuchs:) and if a Pilgrim come,
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>a Ravisher, or wicked Man, a Chri∣stian, or any of Religion different from theirs; these said Keepers for∣bid him entrance into <HI>Mecha.</HI> But the body of <HI>Mahomet</HI> is not there, as some affirm, but onely an imagi∣nary form in the Wall of the Church, expressing the lineament of a body, which is often kissed; and so they return home again. Such lying follies, for miracles, these Infidels are possessed with, concerning <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and divers others, so ridiculous, as I omit for modesties sake: yet must advise the Reader, if he please, to interro∣gate any Turk therein, and he will finde I have spoke nothing but meer Truth.</P>

<P>THeir Offerings or Oblations are for the most part upon pro∣mise or vows, in sicknesses or other dangers; and then they kill an Ox or a Sheep, according to abilities; and promise to sacrifice it in some certain place. This Offering is not burnt, or placed on an Altar, after the custome of the <HI>Jews;</HI> but the beast being killed, the skin, head, and feet, and a fourth part of the flesh, is given to the Priest; a∣nother part, to the poor; a third, to neighbours; and the remainder they keep for themselves and friends to rejoyce withal. Neither are they tied to perform these vows, unless they escape the dis∣ease or danger for which they in∣tended them: all things with them being conditionall; <HI>I give you, if you give me.</HI> And the like is

Others give money to free bond-men out of thraldom. But Women for the most part (as most superstiti∣ous) bequeath their gifts to Souldi∣ers, for a certain slaughter of Chri∣stians, which they conceive to be greatly beneficial for their Souls.

They wash the de∣parted body very clean, and wrap it in fine linen; then they carry it out of Town, into some remote place, (for they hold it sinful to bury in their Churches.) first, Friends of the deceased and Priests meet and go in progress, certain Monks bearing wax Candles; then follow some of their Priests singing till they come to the Grave, shaking their heads, &amp; often turning round, fall down with giddiness, as in a trance. The better sort have their Graves lined with Boards at bot∣tom and at sides, and covered with Boards, on which they throw the Earth, and strowe sometimes the seeds of Flowers thereon. Great
<PB N="27" REF="23"/>Men and Bassa's have peculiar Chappels for themselves and Kindred. The poor are buried by high-wayes, or in open-field. If the deceased be of poor ability, there is then money gathered for satisfaction of labour for those re∣ligious Men, which is offered in the Streets.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning War.</HEAD>
<P>THe Turks have all one Empe∣ror or King of the Race of <HI>Otto∣man;</HI> who hath next to himself in Authority two Sangiachs, or Vice∣roys, chief Governours, th' one of <HI>Europe,</HI> th' other of <HI>Asia;</HI> and these have under them Lieutenants of les∣ser quality, who command the or∣dinary Souldiery; and if they fail, being call'd to any expedition, are presently punished with death. He hath others always following him; as Councellors, Guardians of his body, ever neer him; chamberlains, chancellors, &amp; exactors of tribute, for monies and young people; with certain numbers of light-horse, mes∣sengers, &amp; divers others that conti∣nually follow the court. His greatest strength is in his Slaves; Children (for the most part) torn from Chri∣stian Parents, with Tribute-Chil∣dren
<PB N="30" REF="25"/>bred and educated in several Seraglio's, Captives taken in War, and Renegado's. Of these, some are trained up, and serve on horse; who have a double stipend to the Foot, and alwayes ready at com∣mand, in stables keeping four hun∣dred horse together. The great body of Foot-Souldiery are the Janizaries, all commanded by a Chief, called their <HI>Aga,</HI> a person of mighty trust, and like importance; who hath under him divers inferi∣our Commanders, and have Sera∣glio's apart. Of these, and Auxi∣liary Forces, the Turk can draw three hundred thousand to the Field. A great part of these Jani∣zaries attend the Court, Ambassa∣dors houses, and protect all Chri∣stian Inhabitants and Travellers, for rewards; and are faithful in those imployments. Their Standard in the Field, is an Horse-Tail tied upon a pole; an Emblem of their
<PB N="31" REF="25"/>first barbarity and rudeness. His strength at Sea is not considerable, consisting most in Gallies, and those not equal to some Italian Princes; nor hath he many, for want of Slaves, whom he im∣ployes more for Land-services. The best of Shipping, is under the Bassa's of <HI>Algier</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> whom he manageth with much po∣licy; sometime as Rebels, and some∣time as good Subjects, to his best advantage against Christians: for if they complain of loss, the Turk then sayes, <HI>He cannot rule them.</HI> If th' other do the like, he'll take tre∣ble damages.</P>

<P>THere is not any of those great Personages that possess by right of inheritance any Pro∣vince, City or real Estate, to derive unto his Children or Successors,
<PB N="32" REF="26"/>without consent of the King. If any of their Dukes or Princes de∣sire possessions, it must be with this condition; the value of the Place or Territory is first considered, and the Revenues thereof, whereby the Turk apportioneth what number of Souldiers that can annually maintain: then the Lord is en∣joyned alwayes to keep in readiness that number, for any his com∣mands; and in default, his head is lost: nothing can excuse his pre∣sence in any commanded place, but known want of health and sickness. And whensoever it please the Turk to ease him of this benefit, it's at his liberty; but if not deprived, he enjoyes it during life: after death, if his Successors will observe the fame conditions, they are often ad∣mitted; if not, 'tis then disposed to others. And if it happen, any one of these great ones have occa∣sion to speak unto their King, with

<P>THese for the most part are all Eunuchs, castrated when Youths, and bred in <HI>Seraglio's,</HI> for attendants on the Turkish Concu∣bines: and of later yeers, some of them (as I was informed, being a Slave to a great Man in <HI>Constantino∣ple</HI>) are cut so close the body, that they often die by th' incision; and if live, they ever after use small pipes for discharging their water: such is their cruel jealousie, intro∣duced (as 'twas said) by an Empe∣rour that perceived a Gelding leap a Mare. These Bassa's are of greatest esteem with the Turk, next to the Sangiachs; and they are almost all that are preferred to that dignity; Children of Christian Pa∣rents,
<PB N="34" REF="27"/>violently taken from them: and none of them, although he hath to Wife a Daughter of a Turk, (as <HI>Hurstan</HI> Bassa had) can enjoy a Parish, Castle, or Village by inheritance; but if he be pro∣moted to any dignity or possessi∣ons, he enjoyes it till his death, or so long as the Turk pleaseth. Each Bassa hath a Court of Justice in the Province he commandeth, from whence appeals are to the King, or great Mufty; whose sentence is concluding and immoveable.</P>

<HEAD>The obedience of Turks to the King.</HEAD>
<P>NOne of their Janizaries or great Captains have license to wear Swords or other Arms within the Cities, unless the King go forth his Palace, for Devotion sake or Hunting. And where there are Magistrates or Governours of Towns, Porters carry with them
<PB N="35" REF="27"/>staves or clubs; and finding any quarrellings or offerings at inju∣ries, they presently punish them with those instruments; and no man speaking to them, dares look them in the face; but falling on the earth, kiss their feet, with eyes to the ground, and speak as to them∣selves. And whensoever they send forth Messengers with Letters to Governours, Cities, or Pro∣vinces, whose horse grows faint by journeying, this Messenger hath full authority to dis-horse whom ere he meets; and meeting none, he turns into the next Town or Village, and repairs to the chief Officer; and if he presently pro∣vides him not an horse, he's hang'd before his door: and for this cause, many make use of asses, rather then keep horse. And when this Messenger shall come to whom he was sent, he is most honourably received, his Letters kissed with
<PB N="36" REF="28"/>great humility, and their Contents answered with incredible celerity and quick dispatch. No Princes dare contradict one sillable there∣in. None dare (as here) rebel; all men live in such awful fear and trembling: Tortures and present death depending on his will.</P>

<P>THe Emperour distributes in some equality all Provinces to his Noblemen; but with condi∣tion, that such a Souldiery shall be continually maintained by him with the Revenues of that Pro∣vince, both in time of Peace and War. A Souldier killed, is not loss to him, unless the Province likewise be lost: as for example, The Turk hath now four hundred Souldiers, whereof one hundred is maintained by <HI>Hungary;</HI> now if he lose <HI>Hungary,</HI> those Souldiers

<P>THese are stout Souldiers, and excellently versed in military affairs, who in their first encounters break their Lances, without o∣ther Armour, then a Sword, Lance, and Target, using it as we do with Coat of Fence and Helmet; the Lance being broke, they use the Sword, and fight valiantly, alwayes aiming at the head or hands, and think it ignominious to thurst at their adversary, or an horse, with point of Sword. These Men spend all their lives and hopes un∣der the protection of a Goddess, Fortune; having a Proverb with them, <HI>What is written, will befal them;</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="29"/>that is, What that Goddess hath printed on the head at each Man's Nativity, cannot be possibly a∣voided, though he were preserved in a Castle unexpugnable. The actions of these men are writ in verses, and sung by all Men; that others stirried up by like praise and honour, might, with like au∣dacity, advance against an Enemy, couragiously and valiantly: and, for each victory of these Men, their stipends are doubled; and, are obliged attendance on their King, on horse-back, with Lances, Swords, and Iron Clubs: some, have Targets; some, none; and are paid as well in Peace as War.</P>

<P>THeir first are Bow-men, with Arrows, Bows, and Javelins; they are distinguished from Jani∣zaries

The second is of Janizaries, who instead of Bows, have Guns, with short Hatchets: all these are ga∣thered from amongst Christians living under Tribute, by force snatched from their Friends being young, circumcised, and educated as aforesaid. These fight most valiantly against Christians, yet have but slender stipends for their maintenance; some four, five, or six Aspers a day; of which, sixty make a Crown English. And these are prohibited on pain of death, to come on horse-back, un∣less sick. There are some few likewise, sons of Turks, made Jani∣zaries. There is a third order, whom they call Azaplars, whose stipends determine with the War, and are all sons of Turks. These use a longer Lance, with Swords, and red hats or bonnets, or other co∣loured cloath, with crooked angles
<PB N="40" REF="30"/>like half Moons; and so distinguish∣ed by Arms and Habit, from th' o∣ther orders. There is a fourth of the Grecian sect, who have no other stipend, then freedom from paying Tributes and Tenths.

<HEAD>Of the Turks Pavilions.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the King removes from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to any Expedi∣tion of War, he carrieth with him double Tents, that when one is planted this day, th' other is carried to the next station, ready to receive him the day following: the num∣ber and magnitude of these Pavili∣ons is such, that afar off they seem no less then Cities: round a∣bout the King's Pavilion, are the Tents of Princes and great Men,
<PB N="41" REF="30"/>encompassing his in circle. Then the horse-men of Arms, two or three together, have their Tent: the foot-men have the like for dis∣cipline sake, and to keep them from cold Air. When the body of the Army moves, Yeomen foot∣men clear the wayes, and here and there make heaps of stone, or piles of wood, for ease and direction of the passage; so as even in dark∣ness of the night they can hardly erre. The Army moveth at mid∣night, and till mid-day following marcheth. The King rides be∣tween two Bassa's talking with him, before whom marcheth some of the order of Janizaries on horse∣back, bearing lighted Candles in time of night. Certain Cap∣tains follow them with iron Clubs round pointed, who keep off men from sight of the King a good large distance: amongst these, are num∣bers of the King's Guard; and a∣mongst
<PB N="42" REF="31"/>them, a Chariot of Women and Boyes, fitted for use of the Turk and his Nobility. These great Men, go some before, some follow these Captains with great multitudes of Souldiers, horse and foot, and all conditions; some for stipend, some for plunder; but all men.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="31"/>upon their Beasts, they expose to sale; bisket, dry meats, cheese, curds, and milk. All Turks are generally most patient in suffering hunger, thirst, and cold. They seldom lodge in Towns, but field it in their Tents, neer water-springs, Rivers, or Meadows, taking more care of their cattel then themselves; content with little and course diet, curds mingled with water, bread with milk, sometime bisket: ma∣ster and servant eat together. They keep deep silence in the night; they neglect stirring after fugitives, for fear of raising clamours; which are forbid upon great mulcts and pu∣nishments: but when they go to rest, or rise to march, all with an u∣nanimous noise, cry out, <HI>Allah, Allah, Allohu,</HI> that is, <HI>O God,</HI> thrice repeated.</P>

These Guardians are bound to free and preserve all Orchards, Gardens, Closes, they pass by; so far, that they themselves dare not touch an Apple, Pear, or Grape, or any such-like thing, without the owners license; otherwise they lose their heads.

<HEAD>Of their Garments.</HEAD>
<P>THeir Vestments are made of Wool, Flax, and spun Silk, sufficiently magnificent. They use a Garment (which is cal∣led <HI>Chaucan</HI>) straight, full of plaits, and of length even to their ankles;
<PB N="55" REF="37"/>abhorring breeches, as too much directing to, and expressing privi∣ties. Their shirts or smocks are dyed in colour Violet. Their heads are covered with great rolls of Callico, or such-like stuffe, wound about in fashion of Pyra∣mids; which they call <HI>Turbants.</HI> Women of quality go alwayes with their faces veiled; which are never seen of strangers, or in publick places. Their shooes are high, with strong soles, for longer ser∣vice both of men and women. Some say that <HI>Mahomet</HI> had a bald or scalded head, which he covered with white linen rolled up, as their <HI>Turbants,</HI> from thence derived, and still continued, for they never alter fashions. They wear long beards, as tokens of their freedom, all Slaves being shaved. No great difference in habit between rich and poor; but in the stuffes. They are religiously cleanly, and never

The third is made of a Fruit (called <HI>Pechmez</HI>) into Must, and hath a kinde of Honey-taste and colour with it; this, mingled with Water, is given to their Ser∣vants. The Houses where they sell, are frequented as Osteries in <HI>Italy,</HI> or Taverns with us.

<P>WHen they go to Dinner, they first strow Mattresses on the floor, and spread upon them Carpets or Pillows; some sit on the bare ground. Their Tables are made of skins, and plaited, to be drawn open more or less, like to a budget. They neither sit, as we do, nor lie along on elbowes, as the ancients; but like a cross of <HI>Burgondy,</HI> with leggs infolded, they sit Taylor-wise. They alwayes Pray before they eat, then eat greedily and hastily, but with deep silence; and in that time their Wives secluded from them. Men-servants after twelve yeers age, are never suf∣fered to co-habitate in houses where Women are; but under such age,
<PB N="59" REF="39"/>they go about the houses, serving their Master's occasions. Captive women have never liberty to go a∣broad, unless their Mistresses or Ladies go to Vineyards, Graves of Friends departed, Baths, or Gardens out of Town (which they often do) for recreation sake; and otherwise are kept strict at work in houses, not suffered to converse with other captive Servants; as shall be more at large declared in the following Chapter. Their dishes are commonly placed at such distance one over another, as 'twere on Pillars, that each man may make choice of three, which pleaseth best. They eat three times a day; but quick therein, unless at a Feast, where they sit all day.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen the King of <HI>Turks</HI> makes Expeditions a∣gainst Christians, a∣mongst divers sorts of Merchants, there al∣way follow him on Camels, a mighty number of Buyers or Scor∣cers of Children or Men, who in hope of getting Slaves, carry with them bundles of long Ropes, wherewith they easily tye together
<PB N="61" REF="40"/>fifty or sixty men. These traders purchase of the Souldiery or Free∣booters, whomsoever the Sword hath not devoured; which is granted them, upon condition that the King may have the tenth of what is traffick'd for, the rest unto themselves to sell. Nor is there any Merchandize so profita∣ble amongst them, nor so fre∣quent; as anciently among the <HI>Romans,</HI> who called things fairly bought, their proper Goods and Rights, as just as that of Slaves.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>How the Turks imploy their slaves.</HEAD>
<P>THe youth and aged of both Sexes, whom Chance by tenths appropriates to the <HI>Turk,</HI> he thus disposeth; the elder in yeers he sells for Husband-men, who yet are rarely or cheap bought; for they seldom escape the Sword; their age making them less vendible.
<PB N="62" REF="41"/>Young men and Maidens, they con∣fine them in <HI>Seraglio's,</HI> there to be instructed in useful Arts for future times. But first, they must deny their Faith in Christ, and then be circumcifed. And thus initiated in their Ceremonies, they diligent∣ly examine their physiognomies, and the several lineaments of their bodies, and then the whole com∣posure; and according to conceived strength, forwardness of wit, and dispositions, they are destinated to learn Laws of the Country, or dis∣cipline of Wars; and in the mean time are allowed a dayly stipend of two or three Aspers, sixty whereof make five shillings, which they conceive a liberal sufficiency for diet and clothing, until they are fitted for imployments. In the elements of War, they thus are trained, according to each strength: they first have given them a light bow; skill and strength in∣creasing,
<PB N="63" REF="41"/>they have a greater and a heavier; so by degrees they are fitted for expedition. They have Instructors, severe Exactors of their dayly Exercises; and when∣soever they erre much from the mark, so often are they cruelly whip'd with scourges. These are inrolled in the order of Bow-men. Others are instructed and made fit for Janizaries, who have appoint∣ed Masters and Teachers every day to fight, two together with Cud∣gels. Others (an horrid thing) who have more lovely faces, are so close cut, that nothing like Man is left them; and this not done with∣out great and eminent danger to life: and if the party escape death, his health is for no other use, but their most wicked lusts; and after youth's grown aged, they are put to the offices of Eunuchs, to attend on Ladies, Concubines, Horses, Mules, and some Kitchin-imploy∣ments.</P>

<P>HItherto hath been spoken how the Kings use Captives; now how private men their Prisoners newly taken: first, they threaten them with all sorts of meancing sharp words, promises, and allure∣ments to entice them to Circumci∣sion; which if yeilded to, they are treated somewhat more courte∣ously; but then all hope of ever returning to their Country is clean cut off; and whosoever endeavours it, burning is his appointed punish∣ment. Such as are thought more firm and less fugitive, are admitted to their Masters Military imploy∣ments, and can onely be made free, when age hath made them use∣less; and then he is rather turned off, then remitted orderly; or when the Master by hurt in War, or danger of death, bequeaths him
<PB N="66" REF="43"/>liberty. They are permitted marriage; but their Children are disposed at the Master's pleasure; which makes the more understand∣ing sort utterly abhor marriage. They who refuse Circumcision, are miserably and unhumanely treated; of which I have had the experience of thirteen yeers suf∣ferings: nor can I express in words the great calamities of such people.</P>

<P>THe condition of such unskil∣ful men is wretched.

<PB N="67" REF="43"/>or Manscourser bestows no cost on them, as scant vendible; they walk with naked head and feet, and often their whole bodies; no new cloaths succeed, the old worn out; they are hurried through Mountains, Rocks, from place to place, Winter and Sum∣mer, and have no end thereof till death, or that they finde a foolish Purchaser, that (they think) buyes ill Merchandize; but no man is so happy, or esteem'd amongst them, for Age, Art or Beauty, that they being sick will leave behinde them. First, they are whipped to go on; if they cannot do that, then they are put on horseback; and there not able to sit upright, their bellies are tied on horseback, no otherwise then a sack of Corn or Cloak-bag; if he die, he's strip'd of all cloaths, and thrown into the next ditch, to be devoured by dogs and vultures.</P>

<HEAD>How Prisoners newly taken are used.</HEAD>
<P>THey do not onely binde them in endless chains, but, in their journey, also manacle their hands; they march the distance of a large pace one from another, that mutu∣ally they do no hurt; and tye their hands, lest with stones they mis∣chief do their Masters: that when sometimes they lead great multi∣tudes, as ten times five hundred chain'd together, the strength of whom, if hands at liberty to throw stones, might much annoy them. At night when they rest, their feet are likewise chained, and exposed to all injuries of weather. The condition of Women is a little more humane; they who have strength of limbs, are driven on foot; those more tender, are set on horses; such as are infirm and can∣not ride, are put in baskets or ripi∣ers,
<PB N="69" REF="44"/>as we use geese. Afterwards their condition is sadder; either they are included in strong Tur∣rets, or forced to endure the wicked lusts of their Merchants. Where still they are, is ever heard vast and hideous howlings of both sexes, suffering violations from them; neither doth the age of leaven or six yeers, defend them from those vitious actions: a people incom∣parable wicked, both against na∣ture, and before libidinous.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>How used that are exposed to sale.</HEAD>
<P>AT the break of day they are brought to Market, like droves of sheep, or herds of goats: Merchants appear, prizes are set; if the prisoner be liked, his cloaths are stripped off, he is viewed by the buyer, all members suveyed, tryed and throughly searched for faults in joynts or arteries; if he
<PB N="70" REF="45"/>please not, then returned to the owner▪ and this is done until he finde a purchaser. When bought, he's carried to some heavy servi∣tude, to plow, keep sheep; omit∣ing baser Offices. They endure there many unheard examples of calamities: I have seen men tyed together with yokes, to draw the plow. Maidens are severely forced to perpetual labours; separated from the sight of men, nor are they suffered speech or conference with other Servants. If any man be taken Prisoner with wife and chil∣dren, him some great person wil∣lingly purchaseth, to be imployed in his Country-house, in Tillage, Vineyards, Meadows, Pastures; and Children born of them, are all his Slaves: and if they persevere in Christian Faith, a certain time is alotted them to servitude, and then made free; their Children notwithstanding continue Slaves
<PB N="71" REF="45"/>at the Master's will, and imployed where he pleaseth; for they have no certain nor enrolled Estates of Lands, and so no assured seats of residence. If after making free, they desire to return to their Country, they have Letters Pa∣tents given for their Journey. But to such as abjure the Christian Religion, no certain time of bon∣dage is prescribed them, nor right of return; all hopes of their liberty, totally depends upon the Master's pleasure: and when they have got freedom, they pay the Tenths, as other Turks, but freed from other Taxes with which Christians are burthened.</P>

The Master and the Wife have some small Tents; no shelter for the Shepherd, unless at spare times compelled to work on Tapestry or Carpets. Every month they change their Pastures, and drive their flocks from one Moun∣tain to another. Some Masters that have more humanity, now and then give small rewards, which the Servant keeps as his proper Goods, and preserves, to bear the charge of a return to his Country, if ever he get liberty; but these largesses are seldom done, and then, but as a miserable enticement to servitude, thinking thereby to withdraw their hopes of shifting from them.

<P>VVHen a Province is sub∣dued and taken, all sorts of Goods moveable and immove∣able are given away for spoyle. They totally extirpate the whole Nobility; but especially the Princely Issue. And when they took <HI>John</HI> the King's Son of <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> and favoured him with life, it was on good advice, that if <HI>Hun∣gary</HI> were lost again, they might imploy and involve him in∣to any new incumbrances; and when the Province should be in a quiet and calme condition, then to dispatch him: for in such re∣spects, the Turk regards neither Kindred, Father or Brother; he
<PB N="79" REF="49"/>spares none. And if they do kill and murder not all Church and Clergy-men they take; yet they expose them to all scorn, naked∣ness and beggery, despoyling them of all their Fortunes, Goods, and Dignities. Their Bells, their Organs, and other Instruments and Ornaments of Churches, Chappels, and Devotions, they ra∣ven and tear from the Temples, profaning them with consecration to their <HI>Mahomet;</HI> leaving onely the most miserable and wretched Chappels to the Christians, where∣in they are forbid publick Pray∣ers, and may pray seemingly in silence: which Chappels, when either Earth-quake, Fire.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>A Narration of a dispute with a</HI> TURK.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter I had travelled with much labour and many dangers the bet∣ter parts of the world, and seen many plea∣sant Towns &amp; Countrys, as <HI>Socrates, Plato,</HI> &amp; other Philosophers had di∣ligently done; at length I arrived at the famous City of <HI>Hungary, Vara∣dinum,</HI> where by chance I met one <HI>Dervis Gsielebi,</HI> a skilful man in the Laws of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> who having dispatched his business with the
<PB N="86" REF="53"/>Governour, he very much desired conference with some Christian a∣bout Religion on either side. This motion of his being published by an Interpreter, and none for divers dayes appearing to encounter him, in defence of the Christian cause, though many religious persons were in that Town, (struck mute and speechless at the courage of one Ethnick Infidel) who seemed to me like <HI>Israelites,</HI> that durst not adventure on one uncircumcised <HI>Goliah,</HI> provoking them. This I perceiving, and grieving in my spirit, that in such plenty of Clerks and learned men, none was so well armed with Truth, as durst (though by Interpreters) reprove the inso∣lence of such an Heathen; And fearing that so wicked and detesta∣ble a silence, in so good a Cause, with so bad a Man, would betray the Truth, and render our Saviour Jesus Christ's Opinion with him
<PB N="87" REF="53"/>more ignominious; I my self, though never called to Ecclesiasti∣cal Function, undertook the charge of arguing this point of Piety with him; and so a prefixed day was agreed on between us: when multitudes of people of each Reli∣gion, came Spectators of the e∣vent. The place was in a Mo∣nastery of <HI>Franciscans;</HI> the day, <HI>Whitson</HI>-Sunday, day of Pentecost; where he moved to me first this Question: <HI>Where God had his being, before the Heavens and Earth, and therein all things else were created?</HI> Which Question, though it seemed to me not much pertinent to our purpose, yet lest he should imagine us ignorant of our great God's uni∣versal presence, I said, He then was in his own being. But when that seemed to him somewhat ob∣scure, and that he did not suffici∣ently understand it, I then told him, He was where he now is. Which
<PB N="88" REF="54"/>he understanding, denied in the general, and said, <HI>Not so; but that he then was in a bright cloud.</HI> Which, when he earnestly affirmed, I quoted <HI>Genesis;</HI> (for they also read the books of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Pro∣phets) and said, If God were in a Cloud, before the Foundation of Heaven and Earth, then that Cloud must be created before them both: and upon further argument on this point, being at last con∣victed, he would dispute no further in it; but gave me leave to pro∣pound some Question to him; and for solemnity of that dayes sake, I thought fit to say something there∣of; and finding these words <HI>(In the name of God, his mercies, and the Spi∣rit of them)</HI> in their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Tongue and Character, I desired him to read them: The mystery of the holy Trinity. Which when he had considered, and wondred at, he said, <HI>Christian,
<PB N="89" REF="54"/>from whence had you this? for in the beginning of all our actions, we</HI> Mus∣selmen <HI>use these three words, and pre∣fix them to every Chapter of our</HI> Alco∣ran; <HI>when we sit down to eat, when we go to prayers, when we wash our hands, or other parts of our bodies, these words we first pronounce; and these actions finished, we sprinkle our heads with water, and repeat these words,</HI> In the Name of God, his Mercies, and the Spirit of them. When thus he had confessed the Truth, I desired to understand from him what he meant by the word <HI>Mercies:</HI> who replied, <HI>He under∣stood it literally, without other signifi∣cation.</HI> Then I applied my self to the mystical Interpretation, and divided it according to Truth into three Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and shewed them written in the <HI>Arabick</HI> tongue. And when he saw I had mentioned the Son of God, he question'd, <HI>How
<PB N="90" REF="55"/>God could have a Son? since according to their Law and Doctrine of Mahomet, God had neither Wife nor Childe.</HI> To whom I answered, according to my weak understanding and capa∣city; We Christians call God the Father, for his Creatures sake, be∣ing the first creating Cause, and sole Preserver of all created, who was for ever in the same Essence he now is in, and will be for Eternity; and is the first Person in the Trini∣ty. We believe the Son, (who by <HI>Mahemet</HI> in the <HI>Arabick</HI> phrase is called <HI>Rahman,</HI> and signifieth <HI>Mer∣cies,</HI> so changed by him) to be likewise God, not according to flesh (for God is a Spirit) born of a Woman; but of the Essence and substance of God Omnipotent, be∣gotten by God the Father, to put away the sins of the World, and so took humane flesh, by the Holy Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> suffered for us, died, and was buried, and ac∣cording
<PB N="91" REF="55"/>to the sayings of the Pro∣phets arose again the third day, and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Fa∣ther, there to judge the quick and the dead, to render immortal happiness to those that have faith in him, and to the unfaithful ever∣lasting punishment.</P>
<P>I then presented him a Crucifix, and said, Behold this now, and see if <HI>Mahomet</HI> did unworthily call the Son of the eternal God by Name of Mercies, when with Arms thus stretched forth, he calls poor sinners to his embraces, say∣ing, <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and art burthened with sins, and I will refresh you.</HI> And to render him more capable of the Trinity, I pointed to the Sun, saying, You have a fair similitude here: as there is but one Sun, that hath form, heat and light; so there is but one God the Father, who hath Son,
<PB N="92" REF="56"/>and the Holy Spirit, which you call <HI>Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ahim,</HI> consisting of three Persons equally of one substance, and from Eternity coexisting.</P>
<P>This comparison wrought in him a belief in God the Father, his onely begotten Son, and the Holy Ghost; a Trinity in Unity. And when he had heard my weak dis∣courses of God the Father, God the Son, and God the holy Ghost, he much admired, with saying, <HI>O God, O God; I, nor any of our Sect, could ever imagine, you had such good thoughts of God; for we conceive you live in darkness of understanding: but by your relation, it seems you have great apprehensions of him; and be∣lieve well, if you did not neglect our great Prophet of God,</HI> Mahomet. I said, What shall we do with the toyes and dreams of <HI>Mahomet?</HI> for besides Baptism and the mystery of the Trinity, which were had from Christians, we know the <HI>Alcoran</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="56"/>contains nought that tends to Truth. Then I alledged to him the fancies and silly trifles of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s two Angels called <HI>Arot</HI> and <HI>Marot,</HI> whom <HI>Mahomet</HI> sayes, That God did send from Heaven, to minister justice unto mortal men, command∣ing them to forbid drinking of wine, and unlawful mixtures with women, &amp; to shew the ways to hea∣ven to no man. These Angels trans∣gressing Divine Commandment, were defiled, deceived, and made drunk by a Woman, and shewed to <HI>Mahomet</HI> the way to heaven; whom, when God saw there, he asked the Angels standing by, who it was that came in that shape thither? And the Angels telling him it was by the error of <HI>Arot</HI> &amp; <HI>Marot;</HI> he turn'd the Woman into a Star, and sent those Angels chained into a well, to be punished everlastingly. Divers like ridiculous stories I related, as that of the Beast <HI>Baraile,</HI> who could speak as
<PB N="94" REF="57"/>man, who carryed <HI>Mahomet</HI> to hea∣ven, where himself confesseth to have seen great Angels with many heads, and those speaking many Languages in divers Tongues; which is sufficiently foolish, &amp; un∣worthy the name of a Prophet; but said, I knew not whether oppressed with Wine, in sleep he dreamed to have seen such miracles, or mon∣strosities in his imaginations. And therefore when he inserts such fol∣lies in his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> he deserves nor the Title of a Prophet from any reasonable man.</P>
<P>Having heard this, somewhat a∣bashed, he arose, and would argue no further: but led me into the Temple, and shewed me certain Images carved in wood; and asked me, <HI>If we did worship those silmilitudes of men, or adore them?</HI> I answered, No; think not we worship the stones or timber wherein these figures are en∣graved; they are used and respected
<PB N="95" REF="57"/>onely as records and remembrances to mens mindes of the passions and sufferings of our Saviour Jesus Christ, for the redemption of our transgressions: and we worship our true God in minde and Spirit, re∣membred by that Crucifix; nei∣ther are you denied the like re∣membrances of your great Princes, and famous men, nor we of holy Saints; but 'tis to give God thanks for their examples of holiness, and our prayers to imitate their cha∣rity and pieties.</P>
<P>In these discoursings, he spies some dogs walking in the Church, and doing something against an Altar, (an evil custom, and to be condemned by all) and asked whe∣ther it was lawful for Beasts to en∣ter our Churches? and blushing with shame, not knowing how to defend this negligence of Christi∣an Pastors, I told him, It was nei∣ther lawful nor seemly; and desired
<PB N="96" REF="58"/>him to conceive it a meer negli∣gence of Officers.</P>
<P>When he heard this, he com∣mended it very much, and desired me to instruct him in our Saviour's Prayer, which I gave him after, in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Dialect.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>A Lamentation for loss of Christians destroyed.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fflicted with an infinite and in∣credible sorrow (most high and mighty Mo∣narchs and Go∣vernours of Christian Commonwealths) to see the sad condition, and most mise∣rable being of our Brethren under the Turkish slavery; whereof some seduced from the bosome of our
<PB N="98" REF="59"/>Church to heretical unhappiness; others with civil and hostise sword, slain, murthered, and cast to de∣vouring Beasts; others made cap∣tive to perpetual servitude, and most cruelly afflicted. They all by me in lamentable sobs and groanings complain, O monstrous, mischievous ambition of ill men, and wicked covetousness of ruling! How many equal souls consecrated to God's Divine Worship, have you betrayed to Death and to the Devil? How many Principalities and Kingdoms of great Kings, and all sorts of Nobility, have you de∣stroyed? How many walls of state∣ly Towns have you demolished? How many sumptuous Palaces and strong stately Castles have you levelled with the ground? How many lawful Owners have you de∣jected from eminent Estates and quiet Conditions, and banished to perpetual disconsolations?</P>
<PB N="99" REF="59"/>
<P>And although I intend not to write the acts of Princes, but to delineate the calamities and trage∣dies of Captives, I cannot forbear remembrance of that abomina∣ble discord of the Earl of <HI>Scrvia,</HI> a potent and proud Prince, who a∣greeing (a shameful foul example of a vitious ambition) with the Bassa of <HI>Bosnia,</HI> (his neighbour-E∣nemy) and having many Castles and strong holds upon the Turkish Confines, even to the River <HI>Savus,</HI> (which divides <HI>Illyria</HI> from <HI>Croatia</HI>) and defended all those Provinces which lye between that River and the River <HI>Dravus,</HI> from Turkish violences and incursions: This Earl or Lord of <HI>Servia,</HI> falling into variance and some petty contro∣versies with the Nobility of <HI>Scla∣vonia,</HI> made friendship with the said Bassa, and joyning their Ar∣mies both together, invaded the <HI>Sclavonians,</HI> partly at difference be∣tween
<PB N="100" REF="60"/>themselves, and partly im∣potent; wholly destroys them and their Province with fire and sword, ruining their Towns and Castles, some by violence and force, some by craft and treachery, (customary with wicked men and Turks) and so totally vanquished and con∣quered them. And after a few Months had passed, this Bassa be∣holding the Earl's rich Provinces, and neighbouring with his, he took or made occasions to invade him, whom at length he kill'd; and so reduced all his Territories under the Turkish Government. Thus this seditious Atheist, Traytor to his Country and his Brethren, most ignominiously lost his life: for such are the Turk's rewards to whomsoever by craft, policy, or villanous fraud, he can lay hold on or ensnare. The like was done with some Noble-men of <HI>Hungary,</HI> whom they reduced to miserable captivity.</P>
<PB N="101" REF="60"/>
<P>Wherefore (most Christian Mo∣narchs) the cruelties of this Ty∣rant, ought with all industry and vigilance, be both feared and pre∣vented; lest considering your fair Provinces, and viewing them with a fascinating eye, he finde you dis∣agreeing, and thereby infeebled, he assault you on all sides, not onely <HI>Candia, Calabria, Malta,</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> but even <HI>Italy, France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Germany;</HI> and prove an universal scourge and terror to all Christen∣dome. They are wise, who by o∣thers harms prevent their own: you are concerned, when your neighbours house is fired. But not to trouble you in this kinde, I recommend to you, most prudent Governours, the correction and a∣mendment of this great error, and return to the deplorable calamities and afflictions our Brethren suffer under the yoke of Tribute in the Turk's Dominions, where some
<PB N="102" REF="61"/>with chains about their necks, are dragged through sharp and spiny parts of <HI>Thracia</HI> and lesser <HI>Asia,</HI> with naked feet, in thirst and hun∣ger: and if by labour of long journeys, diseases, or other griefs they die (as often happens to men of Quality and bred in ease) are hurl'd strip'd in the next ditch, (though not half dead) to the care of ravenous fowls; others, that is, young people of either sex, endure perforce the filthy lusts of their buy∣ers and their fenars, with hideous cryes and howlings of violated and vitiated people; the age of six yeers not defending them: others igno∣rant in husbandry or Mechanick Arts, and literated men (who are least saleable) are for long time driven from Town to Town, from street to street; and being once sold, compell'd with clubs and scourges to learn Trades and dayly employ∣ments in base businesses and griev∣ous
<PB N="103" REF="61"/>pains: others of more robusti∣ous strength, are made slaves to Gallies, tied by the legs with chains, and most miserably tor∣tured; whose sad calamities the power of humane wit cannot ex∣press in words. And if these poor unfortunate souls, could have fore∣known that miserable being, they'd rarther have chosen a thousand deaths. If pains of life and death were e'er commix'd toge∣ther; yea, if to live long and many days, and die every hour, were ever extant, it is in <HI>Turky: Aegyptian</HI> ser∣vitude, <HI>Babylonian</HI> banishment, <HI>As∣syriack</HI> captivity, <HI>Roman</HI> destructi∣on, are toyes and trifles to these ca∣lamities. People, who live as it were in the firy Furnace of the <HI>Chaldean Hur,</HI> and crying up to heaven with sighs and groans, <HI>O Lord, how long! arise and forsake us not in the end:</HI> and when oppressed and grieved be∣yond all hope, they turn their eyes
<PB N="104" REF="62"/>again on their own Countries, like∣wise in captivity; yet wish them∣selves rather slaves there, then where they are: their prayers are not for liberty, but change of place; and for that cause, indiffe∣rent for death or life, they turn Fu∣gitives; and some leaving their flocks in deserts, their Oxen at plow, expose themselves to devo∣ration; some murthering their Masters and their Children; some burning their houses in revenge; some run away, hiding themselves in Caves and hollow Trees, with fearful wants and dangers; which I here forbear, having given the Reader some taste thereof before. And now they turn their cries to you all Christian Monarchs and Governours of Commonwealths:</P>
<P>Imploring and beseeching the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> who should be Fa∣ther of our Country, and all sorts of men belonging to Christ his
<PB N="105" REF="62"/>holy Church, That they uniting all sects of men in peace and con∣cord, would labour to suppress this common enemy, and restore their Brethren unto liberty.</P>
<P>Imploring and beseeching the Emperor and all Imperial Princes, Dukes, Cities, and Nobilities, to cool their hot Calentures of ambi∣tion, and avarice of neighbours rights, and set apart domestick quarrels, &amp; call together and unite their strengths against so cruel an Usurper, and hostile Enemy, and labour to defend their present, or else recover their lost Territories: and then be assured, the circum∣spection of the Spanish Souldiery, the warlike fierceness of the Bel∣gicke Provinces, the quick pru∣dence of the Italian wits, the ro∣bustiousness and stoutness of the Germans, will be easily perswaded by the King of Romans, against this universal Enemy; remem∣bring
<PB N="106" REF="63"/>you withal, No Crown sits so gloriously on an Emperour or Princes head, as that which bear∣eth a true Title of the Peoples safe∣ty and lawful Liberties.</P>
<P>Imploring and beseeching the most Christian King of <HI>France,</HI> to employ his helping and heroick Arms, in safeguard (according to his Title) of his Christian Bre∣threns liberties, and his own from Turkish Tyranny.</P>
<P>Imploring and beseeching the most mighty and potent Kings of <HI>England, Poland, Denmark, Swede∣land,</HI> with all Republicks, Cities, and Corporations Christian, to u∣nite, and joyne in one, their strengths and powers in war against this cankered common Enemy of their Religion, Crowns and Digni∣ties.</P>
<P>Imploring and beseeching, all sorts of Powers and Authorities spiritual and temporal, to imploy
<PB N="107" REF="63"/>their diligence, and shew the wor∣thiness of their callings, by cor∣rection and amendment of wicked and dissolute loose livers, by whom God's wrath is kindled against us; and to reduce them to holy Rules of Christian Exercises, in living justly, soberly and religiously, and so render God a true account of Stewardship, and prevent the mi∣series have befallen others drowsie and sleeping inadvertencies.</P>
<P>Imploring and beseeching both young and old, of all sects and con∣ditions, godly Christians religious and secular, beloved Fathers, dear Brethren, respected Friends, Neigh∣bours, and Companions, That you all, with humble face and counte∣nance, pure and sincere hearts and hands, devout mindes, mournfull voyces, and weeping eyes, condole, grieve, and lament the miseries, the calamities of Turkish captives; and call unto the Lord of Hosts with
<PB N="108" REF="64"/>violence in pity to his people, to a∣vert his anger, and not to give them up to the perpetual rebuke of this wicked Infidel, most cruel Enemy of Christian Religion and Liberty; but to inspire the mindes of Chri∣stian Kings and Governours, with light of his holy Spirit, to reduce them all to unity and concord, a∣gainst this ravenous and insatiable Dragon; and grant others such suc∣cess, that these wretched captives, their Christian Brethren, may be restored to liberty in the worship and adoration of their God, our Christ, and onely serve him, who is for ever blessed; that at length the Christian World may be re∣freshed and eas'd from such per∣petual slavery.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>An Exhortation against the</HI> TURK.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have often mar∣velled with my self, most mighty Monarchs, when I considered the advātages which promise Christi∣ans victories against the <HI>Turk;</HI> and yet inso many yeers they attempted none, or failed. We have Jesus Christ our God, who in one onely night destroyed the host of <HI>Sennacherib;</HI> who drowned <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> who with
<PB N="110" REF="65"/>a maiden hand of <HI>Judith,</HI> struck off th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> head of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phernes;</HI> and, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a God, whose will is victory. Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ary to which, they have a <HI>Ma∣homet,</HI> a wicked man of life &amp; con∣versation, in death, yet hanging in his Sepulchre without Resurrecti∣on: so as there is as much difference between them, as is between an ever living Son of an ever living God, and a putrid carkass of a son of a mortal man; that if we diligently examine the nature of each Power and Authority, it would apear like dead men, superi∣ors in strength to living. Now in abilities of bodies, capacities, and gifts of understanding, we exceed them; which are good strengths and fortifications against an enemy: and yet we are still defeated. Who is more hardy then the <HI>Hungarian?</HI> more stout and robustious then the <HI>German?</HI> more quick and nimble then the <HI>Frenchmen?</HI> more grave
<PB N="111" REF="65"/>and solid then the <HI>Spaniard?</HI> more cautelous and prudent then the <HI>Ita∣lian?</HI> more valiant and daring then the <HI>English?</HI> forbearing other Na∣tions, the endowments of whose mindes, are better or at least equal. All these abilities seem able singly to get a victory, or at least well to forward it. Courage often with∣out much force, generosity of minde, wisdom, forecast, ambition of honour, and policy, oft subdues an Enemy; yet notwithstanding, wretches as we are, amongst so ma∣ny victorious attributes, we get no victories. Then if we consider the easie preparation &amp; great furnitures of all sorts of arms, we shall appear far to exceed the Turk. Guns of all sorts have bin our own inventions, and the divers kindes of compleat harnesses for horse and foot. The Turks, Persians Subjects, naked, or half so, march forth to war: they have bows, we guns; that is, fire
<PB N="112" REF="66"/>and thunder: they have arrows, which hardly pierce an Armour; we Cannons, which Rocks cannot withstand: and yet now some <HI>Mussel-men</HI> have Guns and Gunners; but few, and unskilful.</P>
<P>Now I pray, what other kinde of people use they most in Expe∣ditions? <HI>Scythians</HI> and <HI>Thracians,</HI> who have no <HI>Italian</HI> or <HI>Spanish</HI> Spirits, onely a kinde of inhumane fierceness, ignorance and stolidi∣ty: to these are added <HI>Grecians,</HI> lost men with ease and laziness; <HI>Asians,</HI> corrupt with luxury; <HI>Ae∣gyptians,</HI> no less in minde then bo∣dies, feebled; <HI>Arabians,</HI> bloodless, thin, and parboyl'd with the Sun. Who could imagine such-kinde of Souldiery should subdue the great advantages and abilities of those fore named Nations? yet (be it spoken with grief) our Christians by these are overcome, and ma∣stered into servitude, and our great
<PB N="113" REF="66"/>Captains are forced to bear arms a∣gainst us, who were born and bred by Ancestors to liberty: and in the mean season, the <HI>Turk</HI> laughs at us, and the <HI>Jew</HI> rejoyceth.</P>
<P>Now if I shall consider the Laws and Institutions of Nations, we shall be found abundantly superiour in that respect: for, what is more righ∣teous and divine then the Deca∣logue and holy Gospel, written by God's own Finger and his Spirit? what more regular then the Canon-Law? more just and equal then the civil Law? Whereas the <HI>Turks</HI> live by Direction &amp; Dictates of the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> a book of stuff as foolish, as full of vanity; a book of sport and mirth, if pity for the seduced did not allay it; though now spread abroad too much, and handled a∣mongst Christians; so as it may be truely feared, we shall learn other Laws, or shortly lose our own, and turn <HI>Turks</HI> in our mindes and
<PB N="114" REF="67"/>approbations, sooner then in our bodies to their Dominion. What is then the cause, having so many prerogatives of hopeful war, we are alwayes beaten? why are our Ensigns adorn'd with Crucifixes, fearful formerly to infidels and de∣vils, now trampled on &amp; frighted? I shall tell you in few words, and truth, We have a God most great, most good; but alienated from us so far, that according to the Prophets saying, <HI>We scarce are to be named his people:</HI> for why should Christ re∣main with us, whom we have rent and torn in far more pieces, then the Souldiers did his Garment, by our hideous Sects, Schismes and Here∣sies? Besides his Name, what of him is dear unto us? The very Plow man these times is impudent and factious, the Citizen fraudu∣lent and avaritious, the Magistrate seeks retributions and rewards, the Nobility is riotous and lazy, the
<PB N="115" REF="67"/>Gentry contentious and proud; the Souldier, beyond his pay and spoil, craves nothing from the war; let Scepters fall as they will, he is no less grievous to friends and compa∣nions, then Enemies. Church-men besides pomp ecclesiastical, have lit∣tle of the Church; not sanctity, not piety, &amp; some not fitting erudition; seeking their own, not Christ's ad∣vancement; that we may say with the Prophet, <HI>All have declin'd the ways of God, and are unprofitable; there's none that doth good, not, even one.</HI> Why should we marvel then that Christ is not our Friend? We therefore go to war without a God, and what is more calamitous, with God our ad∣versary. We carry Bibles &amp; Cruci∣fixes with us, but the crucified by his favour converseth with our ene∣mies; our actions therefore perish, &amp; are involv'd in losses And when one Nation fights against the <HI>Turk,</HI> another is imploy'd in civil wars,
<PB N="116" REF="68"/>calling to his aid, Pagans, Schisma∣ticks or Hereticks, more eagerly to oppose Christ; others tend their home-affairs, to indulge themselvs in ease &amp; voluptuousness. The soul∣dier sets not forth for Christ, but money; which failing, soon deserts the field, &amp; turns home back again. What have we then from those rich Attributes &amp; Eulogies of <HI>Ger∣many, France, England, Spain,</HI> &amp; <HI>Italy,</HI> when the Souldier neglects both God and Honour, and goes to war, as to market, a brothel-house, or stews, to exercise all rapine, spoil, and lewdness? We have good laws, but evil manners; good furniture of arms, but wicked dispositions: it is our glory to fight among our selves; and if we prove coward to enemies, there follows little shame or punishment. When do we see a Souldier quitting Colours or dis∣banding, severely handled? which crimes were anciently capital; and
<PB N="117" REF="68"/>whole Legions have been deci∣mated and tyth'd for less offences. We therefore march with men few in numbers, and those corrupt in manners, against millions of men well disciplin'd; for <HI>Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks</HI> leave their vices in their houses, from whence we carry ours. In their Pavilions and Tents, no delicious∣ness; arms onely, and necessary pro∣visions: in Christians, all sorts of Table-delicates, luxury and riot∣ousness; and commonly, as many light lascivious Women, as Men. What wonder then if they conquer who are preserved by sobriety, parsimony, diligence, fidelity, and obedience? Let them perish then, who lose a field to get a prey; who are oftner found amongst whores, and drunk, then in good actions: but 'tis the fault and error of Supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iors, when Subjects are not kept in due observance; which if Christians were, we could not be inferiour to
<PB N="118" REF="69"/><HI>Turks.</HI> And yet a greater fault, be∣hold, Princes themselves, while they contend in mutual quarrels, are causes why they cannot muster equal forces against the <HI>Turk;</HI> for whilst they fight and combate for some little Town or other, after grievous strife, conflictation and exhaustion of men and treasure, they grow weak, impoverished and heartless. What brave actions might those streams of Christian blood have done, which civil wars most impiously have drawn out, emptied, and dried up? But 'tis too late to mourn in complaints: <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Affrica</HI> are lost; <HI>Greece,</HI> extin∣guished; <HI>Hungary,</HI> desperately sick; <HI>Illyria</HI> and <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> joyned to the <HI>Turk; Austria,</HI> much enfeebled; and this plague much threatens <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> and Christianity universal; and that so far, that no great Prince or Monarch ought to be se∣cure, or think himself so free, but
<PB N="119" REF="69"/>that he may be forced to defend his own, without invasion of his neighbours Territories, whether it please or not; unless they will become of Princes, Servants; of Free-men, Slaves, detained in perpetual chains, or slain and mur∣thered, that their Subjects may want Captains and good Leaders.</P>
<P>Now, most mighty Monarchs and high Governours, for God's cause, banish from amongst you all dis∣cord &amp; ambitious tyrannies (which are the Devils instruments to main∣tain oppressions &amp; impieties, there∣by to prolong Gods wrath upon you) and restore to each proprietor his due rights and priviledges; and then, as Rivers having free course, haste all smoothly to the sea, &amp; make one mighty body; so your strengths united in the bond of peace, would startle, astonish and drown this great Tyrant <HI>Turk:</HI> which blessing on bended knees, I humbly pray
<PB N="120" REF="70"/>for, and recommend unto the God of Peace. And being reconcil'd a∣mong your selves, if you would say as <HI>Moses</HI> said to <HI>Joshua, Chuse you a man, and go and fight with Amalek;</HI> If you would reduce your selves to this peace and concord, (which is onely hopeful) and put your help∣ing hands and powers, toward so greatly honourable, so blessed, so necessary and profitable a war a∣gainst the Turk; who can imagine, but that ye should at least equal the number of his Souldiery, if not far exceed them? He is now swell'd up to the very height of Ty∣ranny, and hath there remained so for divers yeers, as if expecting, as if waiting an attempt. All full Seas have their ebbings, all ripe fruits are quickly shaken down; there wants nothing to this general and glorious work of Christian Princes, but God's blessing, una∣nimity, and an Heroick courage,
<PB N="121" REF="70"/>brave and masculine. For the Em∣perour can with easiness, raise, arm and muster 50000 horse, &amp; 100000 foot; the like may hopefully be expected from <HI>France,</HI> from <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> the yet remaining parts of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Illyria,</HI> with the Provinces under the King of <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> will raise and maintain 60000. These Christian Forces may make 400000 horse and foot, besides, the Maritime great as∣sistances of <HI>England, Denmark,</HI> u∣nited Provinces, <HI>Venetians, Portu∣gals,</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> and all other Chri∣stian Commonwealths, who, if once unanimous, and freed from jealousies, and petty, wretched, wilful home-contentions, the Turkish power could no more re∣sist ye, then <HI>Darius, Alexander; Xerxes, Themistocles;</HI> or <HI>Antiochus, Judas Macchabeus:</HI> and having got∣ten but one victory, and once pas∣sed the <HI>Danube</HI> towards <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="71"/>God being pleased, and our lives amended, these enemies of our faith would easily be trodden down. All <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Thrace,</HI> (where yet great part retain the law of Christ) expect with greediness the Christi∣an Sword, and readily would re∣volt upon such occasion, and man∣fully assault and fight against those Lords and Masters, that have so cruelly afflicted them: which cir∣cumstance alone, would much hasten, if not perfect a speedy victory.</P>
<P>I would to God, and wish hearti∣ly, most Christian Monarchs, That your civil, fruitless, home-conten∣tions, would permit and suffer you seriously to consider, and calmly to examine these offered motions; you then would finde all mens wills and arms concur with yours; no age, no sex, no conditions of men would leave your Ensigns: Each <HI>Turk</HI> would have his Execu∣tioner
<PB N="123" REF="71"/>at home, his Traytor in his Tent, and fugitive in the field. All Christians amongst them have contemptuous opinions of their arms, and know them onely fitted for light Skirmishes, and Picker∣ings; who, if their noise, like shoals of clamouring Rocks, affright you not, they fly. And whensoever it shall please God to root out from amongst us these perpetual E∣nemies of his faith, and send them to their old lurking holes and caves, and corners in <HI>Bythinia,</HI> by the Christian Sword, (according to some of their own Prophecies) or else to reduce them to the bo∣some of our Catholick Church; no man can doubt, but in short time the Emperor will be seated in his chair at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and invested in his Imperial Roman Territories; The King of <HI>Romans</HI> re-establish∣ed, and recover <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Thrace; France,</HI> lesser <HI>Asia; Eng∣land,</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="72"/>part of <HI>Aegypt; Spain,</HI> part of <HI>Africa; Italy,</HI> all Shores and Banks of the Mediterranean Seas; and last, the Pope, as a great Pastor of the Christian Church, will be ex∣tol'd &amp; magnifi'd for such an union.</P>
<P>These are the apprehensions of all Christian captives under the Turkish Tribute, and even Turks themselves, who have knowledge and long acquaintance in military affairs. And this my self have learned by thirteen yeers experi∣ence, The <HI>Turk</HI> is valiant against a flying, and flying against a valiant Enemy; when therefore he by nature is fugitive, impiety flyes without pursuit. Let God arise and scatter all his Enemies: let those that hate his Doctrine, a∣void his presence: let them like smoak vanish, and melt like wax against the fire: so may all Infidels perish, before the face of God and his holy Church, that
