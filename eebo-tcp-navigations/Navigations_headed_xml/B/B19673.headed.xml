<OPENER><SIGNED>CHARLES R.</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hereas by one Act of Parliament made in the Fifteenth Year of His Majesties Reign, Entituled, <HI>(An Act for the Encouragement of Trade)</HI> it is Enacted, That from and after the Twenty fifth day of <HI>March 1664,</HI> no Commodities of the growth, production or manufacture of <HI>Europe,</HI> shall be Impor∣ted into any Land, Island, Plantation, Colony, Territory or Place to His Majesty belonging, or which shall belong unto, or be in the possession of His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, in <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> or <HI>America, (Tanger</HI> onely excepted) but what shall be <HI>bona fide,</HI> and without fraud Laden and Shipped in <HI>England, Wales,</HI> or the Town of <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> and which shall be carried directly thence to the said Lands, Islands, Plantations, Colonies, Territories and Places, and from no other place whatsoever, any Law, Statute, or Vsage to the contrary notwithstanding, under the Penalty of the Loss of all such Com∣modities of the Growth, Production or Manufacture of <HI>Europe,</HI> as shall be Imported into any of them, from any other place whatsoever, by Land, or by Water; and if by Water, of the Ship or Vessel also in which they were Imported, with all her Guns, Tackle, Furniture, Ammunition and Apparel; the said forfeitures to be dispo∣sed as by the said Act is directed: Provided, that it shall be lawful to Ship and Lade in such Ships, and so Navi∣gated, as in the said Act is expressed, in any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> Salt for the Fisheries of <HI>New England</HI> and <HI>New-found-land;</HI> and to ship and lade in the <HI>Maderas,</HI> Wines of the growth thereof; and ship and lade in the Western Islands, or <HI>Azores,</HI> Wines of the growth of the said Islands; and to ship and take in Servants or Horses in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ireland;</HI> and to ship or lade in <HI>Scotland,</HI> all sorts of Victual of the growth or production of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and to ship or lade in <HI>Ireland,</HI> all sorts of Victual of the growth or production of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the same to transport into any of the said Lands, Islands, Plantations, Colonies, Territories, or Places; Any thing in the foregoing Clause to the contrary notwith∣standing. And whereas His Majesty is well informed, that notwithstanding the said Act of Parliament, great quantities of other Commodities of the growth, production and manufacture of <HI>Europe,</HI> (then what are by the said Act permitted) have been, and are daily Imported into several of His Colonies, Plantations, and Territories, in <HI>Asia, Africa</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> (besides <HI>Tanger;</HI>) and that His Majesties Subjects of some of His Colonies, and Plantati∣ons, have not onely supplied themselves with such Commodities not Shipped in <HI>England, Wales</HI> or <HI>Berwick,</HI> but have conveyed them by Land and Water, to other of His Majesties Colonies and Plantations, to the great prejudice of His Majesties Customs, and of the Trade and Navigation of this Kingdom: His Majesty therefore for the prevention thereof for the future, doth by this His Royal Proclamation, (with the Advice of His Privy Council) Require and Com∣mand all and every His Subjects, that they do not for the future presume to Import any Commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of <HI>Europe,</HI> (except what may be Imported by vertue of the Proviso aforesaid) by Land, or Water, into any Land, Island, Plantation, Colony, Territory or Place to His Majesty belonging, or which hereafter shall belong unto, or be in the possession of His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, (<HI>Tanger</HI> onely excepted) but which shall be <HI>bona fide,</HI> and without fraud laden and Shipped in <HI>England, Wales,</HI> or the Town of <HI>Berwick,</HI> and carried directly from thence, according to the true meaning of the said Act; whereof all persons concerned are to take notice, and yield due obedience thereunto. And His Majesty doth further strictly direct and require all Gover∣nours of His Colonies, and Plantations, and of all Lands, Islands, and Places in His possession in <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America, (Tanger</HI> onely excepted) to take care that this His Royal Proclamation be put in due execution: And also that one Act made in the Twelfth year of His Majesties Reign, Entituled, <HI>An Act for the Encouraging and Increase of Ship∣ping and Navigation,</HI>) and one Act made in the Two and twentieth and Three and twentieth years of His Reign, En∣tituled, <HI>(An Act for the Regulating the Plantation Trade,)</HI> and also one other Act made in the Five and twentieth year of His Majesties Reign, Entituled, <HI>(An Act for the better Securing the Plantation Trade)</HI> together with all other the Laws of this His Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> relating to the Trade of His Plantations, be duely observed and put in execu∣tion in their respective Governments: And His Majesty doth further require all His said Governours, and that they Command all Officers, Civil and Military under their respective Commands, to be aiding and assisting therein, and to the Collectors and other Officers of His Majesties Customs under them, in the Execution of their respective Offices in order thereunto, as they and every of them will answer the contrary at their utmost perils.</P>
