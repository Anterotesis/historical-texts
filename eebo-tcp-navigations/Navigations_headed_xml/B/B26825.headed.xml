<L>YOu're welcome my <HI>Billy</HI> to the English shore,</L>
<L>I hope you'l not cross the ruff Seas any more,</L>
<L>Many a day too, and many a night,</L>
<L>My heart grieved sore cause you were out of sight,</L>
<L>But now to my comfort I see you again,</L>
<L>Oh never dear <HI>Billy,</HI> Oh never dear <HI>Billy,</HI></L>
<L>Sail more on the Main.</L>

<SPEAKER>Billy.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Dear</HI> Molly, <HI>said</HI> Billy, <HI>the</HI> joy of my heart,</L>
<L>Daily I thought on you since we did part,</L>
<L>And when the roaring waves mounting high they did move,</L>
<L>In the greatest danger I thought on my Love,</L>
<L>The billows did foam and the Rocks they were nigh,</L>
<L>Yet nothing but Death, yet nothing but death,</L>
<L>shall my Love part and I.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<L>I thank thee my dear for thy firm Love to me,</L>
<L>In the midst of thy dangers upon the ruff Sea,</L>
<L>Each Night in my Bed still as down i was lain,</L>
<L>I dreamed of Ship wracks upon the salt Main,</L>
<L>But now I do find from those dangers i'm free,</L>
<L>Since him that I love, since him that i love,</L>
<L>is come safe unto me.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Billy.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed my dear <HI>Molly,</HI> the Powers above,</L>
<L>Preserv'd me from dangers for thy tender love,</L>
<L>For I have been where thundering Cannons did roar,</L>
<L>Their Bullets like Footballs flying from the Shoar,</L>
<L>The danger of Tempest and Cannon balls too,</L>
<L>I have undergone, I have undergone.</L>
<L>for <HI>the sake Love</HI> of you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<L>My dearest its true, for the fault is in me,</L>
<L>for thou would'st have Wed, but i said go to Sea,</L>
<L>But when thou wert gone, how my heart was opprest</L>
<L>I scarce had a Minute of pleasure and rest,</L>
<L>for by Day all my fear was of danger to thee,</L>
<L>And by night i did dream, &amp; by night i did dream</L>
<L>Still of Storms on the Sea.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Billy.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Dear thou dream'st right, for e're we got home,</L>
<L>for <HI>several</HI> Days we had Storm after Storm,</L>
<L>we lost all our Masts and our Tackle to boot,</L>
<L>in Tempestuous nights on the Ocean did float.</L>
<L>But thanks unto Heaven we had no Men lost,</L>
<L>And the brave Royal <HI>Sou'rain,</HI> the brave Royal <HI>Sou' rain,</HI></L>
<L>come safe to our Coast.</L>

<L>Oh my dear precious, my <HI>Billy</HI> my joy,</L>
<L>There's nothing my happiness now can destroy,</L>
