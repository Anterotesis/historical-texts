<L>THere was a Maid as I heard tell</L>
<L>which fell in desperation,</L>
<L>She lov'd a Young-man passing well,</L>
<L>which brought her in vexation:</L>
<L>The Young-man had the Maid beguil'd,</L>
<L>the matter so was carried,</L>
<L>For he had gotten her with Child</L>
<L>before that they were married</L>
<L><HI>Which caus'd this Maid to make great moan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and often times to speak so,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My belly is up and my heart is down,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and my Love is gone to Jamaica.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He was my joy and hearts delight,</L>
<L>and well my mind contented,</L>
<L>But now hée's gone out of my sight,</L>
<L>I sorely am tormented:</L>
<L>Whilst he with me was living here,</L>
<L>heaven knows I lov'd him dearely,</L>
<L>But now my heart will burst with care,</L>
<L>it touch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th me so nearly.</L>
<L><HI>I sigh I sob▪ and I make great moan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>the cause wherefore I speak so. &amp;c.</HI></L>

<L>My Love was wondrous kind and frée,</L>
<L>when as first he came a woing,</L>
<L>And many good guifts he gave to me,</L>
<L>because he would be doing:</L>
<L>My Love gave me a Beaver Hat,</L>
<L>methought it was br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve and bonuy,</L>
<L>And a gallant Love-fancy to weare in it,</L>
<L>which cost five pound in mony:</L>
<L><HI>but now I weep and make great moan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>the reason why I speak so, &amp;c,</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Love gave me a Silken Gown,</L>
<L>with rich and costly Laces,</L>
<L>Ther's not a br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver in the Town,</L>
<L>it all the rest surpasses:</L>
<L>My Love gave me a gay gold Ring,</L>
<L>and Bracelets made of Amber,</L>
<L>He also gave me a better thing,</L>
<L>when he had me in his Chamber.</L>
<L><HI>I sigh, I sob, and I make great moan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>the reason why I speak so,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My belly is up and my heart is down,</HI></L>
<L><HI>for my Love is gone to Jamaica.</HI></L>

<L>MY love gave me a Holand smock</L>
<L>and bid me for to weare it</L>
<L>One night 'twixt ten &amp; eleven a clock</L>
<L>I'm sure he did not teare it:</L>
<L>My Love gave me a Feather bed,</L>
<L>to lye on when I was weary</L>
<L>On which he had my Maiden-head</L>
<L>when he had made me merry</L>
<L><HI>but since dame fortune she doth frown</HI></L>
<L><HI>this makes me sigh and speake so,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My belly is up and my heart is down</HI></L>
<L><HI>and my Love is gon to Jamaica.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And since that time I am possest,</L>
<L>with many griefs I tell yée</L>
<L>In head, in side in back and breast,</L>
<L>but chiefly in my belly:</L>
<L>Oh that my love were here againe,</L>
<L>I'm sure he would befriend me,</L>
<L>And use a meanes to cure my pain,</L>
<L>and take a course to mend me.</L>
<L><HI>I sigh, I sob, and I make great moan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>the reason why I doe so, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If I had <HI>Icarus</HI> wings to flye,</L>
<L>I doe so greatly mind him,</L>
<L>Then I would soone beyond the Seas,</L>
<L>and séeke till I could finde him,</L>
<L>If that he were in France or Spain.</L>
<L>or els in High Spaniclo.</L>
<L>I'de surely méet with him again,</L>
<L>so closely would I follow.</L>
<L><HI>The Indies and the Wildernesse,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and hollow caves Ide seek to.</HI></L>
<L><HI>And every place both more and lesse,</HI></L>
<L><HI>bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nging to Jamaica.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus many a woful day and night</L>
<L>the Damsel lay lamenting,</L>
<L>Before her love appear'd in sight</L>
<L>to yéeld her hearts contenting:</L>
<L>But mark what hapned at the last</L>
<L>when she so long had mourned,</L>
<L>The bonny Lad that she lov'd best,</L>
<L>safely from Sea returned.</L>
<L><HI>But when she heard her true-love speak</HI></L>
<L><HI>she knew him by his tongue Sir,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Her heart did in her belly leap,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and about his neck she flung Sir.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good Lord what kissing there was then;</L>
<L>with friendly kind embraces,</L>
<L>Vntill the joyfull tears of them</L>
<L>ran down each others faces:</L>
<L>The very night when this was done</L>
<L>as is for certain spoken,</L>
<L>She was delivered of a Son,</L>
<L>a fair and goodly token,</L>
<L><HI>Whereby she alters s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on her tune,</HI></L>
<L><HI>her fancy made her speak so,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My heart is up and my belly is down,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and my Love is come from Jamaica.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon after that the Seaman bold,</L>
<L>he having of mony plenty,</L>
<L>Cast in her lap ten pound in gold.</L>
<L>and halfe crown pieces twenty:</L>
<L>And since that time they married are,</L>
<L>whereby their joyes are double,</L>
<L>And now she sings with a merry chéer,</L>
<L>being frée from care and trouble.</L>
<L><HI>My sorrows all are past and gone,</HI></L>
<L><HI>which makes me sing and speak so,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My hart is up and my belly is down,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and Love is come from Jamaica.</HI></L>
