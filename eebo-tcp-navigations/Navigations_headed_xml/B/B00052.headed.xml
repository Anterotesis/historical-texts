<HEAD>¶ Of the Region of <HI>Tarta∣ria,</HI> and of the Lawes and power of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Artaria,</HI> which by ano∣ther name is called <HI>Mon∣gall,</HI> as <HI>Vicencio</HI> writeth, standeth towardes the northeast, and at the East parte ioyneth with the Land of the <HI>Catheos</HI> and <HI>Solangos:</HI> on the South parte it bordereth with y<SUP>e</SUP> Country of <HI>Sartanecos,</HI> &amp; on the West parte with that of the <HI>Naymanos,</HI> and of the North parte it is cōpassed about with the Occean Seas. It was called <HI>Tartaria,</HI> by reason of a Riuer running by it, called <HI>Tartar,</HI> and is a Region where the greatest parte is full of Moun∣taines, and the most part of the plaine fields verie sandie, being a barren countrey, sauing that some parte of it is ouerflowen with the waters of y<SUP>e</SUP> Ryuers, &amp; a great parte thereof is wildernesse &amp; litle inhabited. Ther are no Cities nor Townes in it, sauing onelye the Citie of <HI>Cracuris.</HI> Ther is so great want and smal store of wood in it, that the people there are driuen to vse for the most parte the offall and dung of Oxen and Horses for their fuel, aswell in rosting and boyling their victuals,
<PB REF="5"/> as otherwise. The ayre of this Region is ve∣ry intemperate, and full of stormes and tem∣pests, that in the sommer time there are such wonderfull thunders and lightninges, that men die for very feare of the same. At other times there is great heat, and immediate∣ly followeth verye extreame colde, and snowe falling very thicke. The windes there are so boysterous an strong almost continu∣ally, that they drawe men backward as they are ryding on their iournyes, ouerthrowing them to the ground, and also blowe vp trees by the rootes, and to conclude do much other harme. In the winter it neuer rayneth, in the summer many times, and at euery of the same so little, that scarselye it wetteth the ground: and yet for all this it is a rich coun∣trey of all kinde of cattell, as well oxen as Camels, &amp;c. Of beastes of seruice and hor∣ses there is so great store and plentie, that it is to be supposed, there are not so many moe in all the rest of the worlde. There were at the beginning in this Realme foure sortes of people: The first sorte called <HI>Yeca Mon∣gales,</HI> which is as much to saye the great <HI>Mongales:</HI> The second sorte called <HI>Sumon∣gales,</HI> which signifieth the <HI>Mongales</HI> of the water, because they dwell neere to the Riuer
<PB N="2" REF="5"/> <HI>Tartar,</HI> whereof they beare the name of <HI>Tar∣tars:</HI> The third are called <HI>Mercat,</HI> and the fourth sorte <HI>Metrit:</HI> All these had one man∣ner of shape of body, and vsed all one lan∣guage. Their manner of lyuing at the firste was fearce &amp; barbarous, without any lawes or policie, they lyued by the increase of rattell, and were a bruite people, and little regarded among the <HI>Scithians.</HI> Afterwarde in processe of tyme they deuided and seuered them selues into certaine places and be∣gan to take theyr Captaines in companie which had charge of the whole common wealth, and yet for all that ceased not to pay tribute to the <HI>Naymanos,</HI> which next adioy∣ned to them, vntill that by chaunce one <HI>Can∣guista</HI> a man brought vp among them, was elected for their king, by meanes of an Ora∣cle and reuelation. This man immediately after he had receiued the Empire and So∣uereigne gouernment, commaunded that all honour accustomed to be done to the deuill, should ceasse, and established by his generall edicte, that all people shoulde honour and worship one onelye GOD, the migh∣tiest, greatest and best of all others, and also gaue expresse commandement, that it should be generally published that he had receyued the Realme by the same Gods prouidence.
<PB REF="6"/> After this he commaunded that all such as could beare armour, should come forthwith and represent them selues before him by a certeine day. And all the people apt for the warres being come together, he in his owne person hauing taken the number of them, de∣uided them in order, and appoynted ouer thē Corporals, Sargents, Captaines and Co∣ronels. &amp;c. After this, to proue what force and power he had in the empire and supreme authoritie: he commaunded seuen of the most principall men that first had the charge and gouernment of all the Realme, to kill their sonnes with their owne handes, the which though it was and seemed a very hard thing vnto thē, yet they accōplished it forthwith, be¦ing moued thervnto, partly for feare of the cō∣mon people, and partly by reason of a deuout superstition in that they had conceiued a stedfast beliefe that God was the beginning and foundation of that kingdome, and that if they refused to obey the commaundementes of their king, they committed not an offence to him, but to God. And with this trust and power so raysed, the king <HI>Canguista,</HI> first of all brought vnder his subiection, by force of armes, the <HI>Scithians</HI> that bordered vpon his countrey making them his tributaries, with
<PB N="3" REF="6"/> the other people also to whom his owne sub∣iects had before payed tribute, and forthwith set vpon diuers other nations both farre and neere from his owne dominions, hauing so prosperous successe, that he brought in sub∣iection vnder his Empyre all the Realmes, Dominions &amp; nations, euen from <HI>Scithia</HI> vn∣to the <HI>Mediterran</HI> sea, wher the Sun ryseth, &amp; some what more, insomuch that with reason he intituleth him selfe Lord and Emperour of all the East partes.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Tartars</HI> are of an euill shape in their bodies, the most part of them being of a small stature. They haue great eyes, stan∣ding farre out, and the liddes thereof coue∣red with very much hayre, in such sorte that there can but a litle of their eies be sene, their faces are brode, they haue no beards, sauing on their vpper lips, &amp; in the same haue but a few hayres, and those very thin: al of them for the most part are slender in the wast, in the fore pare of their heads they weare their hayre long like women of our countrey, and make two rowles thereof, and so gather thē behind their eares: and not only the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> do thus, but also such as are ioyning nere to them do the like. They are light peo∣ple and good horsemen, but euill foote∣men,
<PB REF="7"/> none of them do go afoote, although they be very little. Their manner is to ride vpon horses or oxen whether so euer they tra∣uaile, and the women vse Geldinges that are not fierce. They also vse to haue their forheds decked with siluer and precious stones, and conceiue a great glorye, in that their horses carry collers of belles to make a great iyng∣ling. Their speach is sharpe and high, when they would singe they howle like wolues, when they drinke they shake the head, and al∣so they accustome to drinke so often, tyll they fall downe, and take it for great honour.</P>
<P>They inhabite neither townes nor cities, but in the fieldes, as the <HI>Scithians</HI> did in the olde time, vnder Pauilions and Tentes: For the most parte are shepheardes. In the win∣ter they vse to lyue in the plaine fieldes, in the Sommer they continue in the moun∣taines, for the fruitefulnesse of the pasture. They make their lodginges and plates of abode like a shoppe eyther of bowes, or of timber, couered with felt, and in the middest of these sheddes, make a rounde windowe where the light commeth in, and the smoke goeth out, in the middest of the cottage is the fire, and their wiues and children alwayes about it. The men vse to shoote in bowes,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/> and to wrastle, they are merueilous hunters, they ride a hūting armed on horsback, &amp; whē they see any wilde beastes, they compasse them about, and euery one of them shooting his arow, they wound, &amp; take him. They haue no bread, vse no table cloth nor napkins, and beleeue in one God onely, affyrming him to be the maker of all thinges, visible and inui∣sible, they honour him not with any ceremo∣nie, but make certeine Iodls of felt, or silke, or the likenesse of a man, and put them on both sides of their sheddes or shoppes, praying them to keepe safe their cattell, and shewing great reuerence toward them, offe∣ring them all the milke that they haue first of the cattell, and before they beginne to eate or drinke, they set their part before them. Any manner of beast that they kyll for to eate, they put his hart in a vessell all night, and in the morning seeth and eate it. They honour and do sacrifise likewise to the Sunne and Moone, to the foure Elements, and also the great <HI>Chaam</HI> their king and Lorde, whome they thinke to be the Sonne of God, and so honour him deuoutly, and do sacrifice to him, and beleue that in al the world there is none better, nor of more dignitie then he, neyther wil they consēt y<SUP>t</SUP> any other be named but be.</P>
<PB REF="8"/>
<P>This people in respect of them selues, thinking no other nation worthy to be com∣pared with them, in wisdome nor goodnesse, and therfore will not willingly speake with any other, but rather auoyd them selues from their companies. They call the Pope and al other Christians dogges and Idolaters al∣ledging that they honour stones and stockes. They are much adicted to wicked arts, geue credit to dreames, and enterteine and allow such as vse the magicall science and arte of diuination, and can enterpret their dreames: Also they aske questions and receiue answer of their Idols, with ful perswasion and be∣liefe that God speaketh in them. And ther∣fore what enterprise so euer they take in∣hand, they begin and proceede in the same by the counsell of those Idols. They behold and marke the weather very much, and espe∣cially the Moone: for they make no diffe∣rence of one tyme more then of an other, nor honour any festiuall day, ne vse any manner of fasting or abstinence. At all times they liue after one fashion, and are so coue∣tous, that what soeuer they see, if it like them well, if they cannot get it with the good will of the owner, being no <HI>Tartar,</HI> they take it from him by plaine stafford law, accoun∣ting
<PB N="5" REF="8"/> it a matter lawfull to be don by meanes of a commaundement and establishment of the king their souereign Lord. For they haue an ordinance of their <HI>Canguista</HI> and <HI>Chaam</HI> their first king, that any manner of <HI>Tartar</HI> or <HI>Tartars</HI> seruaunt finding by the way as he trauaileth any horse, man, or woman without a letter or safe conduct of the king, may sense and take them as his owne, and enioy them foreuer. They lend their monye to such as stand in neede of it, and take a certeine kind of vsurie, both very great and also intollera∣ble: for they take after the rate often pounds vppon the hundred for euerie moneth, and if the vsurie money be not payde immediatly, then they they take further vsurie. They con∣straine the people subued vnto them to paye so excessiue tribute and taxes, and so greatly molest and oppresse them, that there is no people read of, that so much molesteth their tributarie subiects. Their couetousnesse is such, as is skant credible to be beleeued, they are alwayes crauing and brybing, yea the most Lordes of all others, geue nothing to any, no not to such as are in necessitie, nei∣ther giue to poore people almes: onelye in this they seeme worthy of some commenda∣tion, that if any guestes by chaunce come to
<PB REF="9"/> them when they be at meate, and would take parte with them, they turne them not awaye nor disturb them, but rather inuite them, and geue them of that they eate with much pitie. In their diet they are very filthy hauing nei∣ther tables to eate vppon, nor table clothes, nor napkins, &amp; vse not to wash their hāds nor bodyes, nor clothes. They eate no bread, for they haue it not, nor any manner of hearbes, but feede onely with the flesh of al manner of beastes, and likewise pigs flesh, and of cats, horses and rats: and when they take any pri∣soner of their enemies, to shew their crueltie the more, and the desire they haue to reuenge them selues, somtimes they roast them at the fire, and after manye of them assemble and eate him, like vnto wolues, they teare him in peeces, and eate his flesh, and take the blood the which they keepe in certein vesselles and drink it, although that otherwise their accus∣tomed drinke is the mylke of beastes. They haue no wine among them, but if by chaunce any be brought thyther to them, they drinke it with great desire and affection, as all o∣ther men do. Likewise they eate the lyce one of an other, taking them out of their heades, or any other place: and when they haue ta∣ken them, they say that they wil do so by theyr
<PB N="6" REF="9"/> enemies. They take it for a great euill a∣mong them, when any part of their meate or drink falleth from them, or is lost, and throw not their boanes to dogges, before they haue fully burnished them. They vse such scarcitie and niggardnesse of all thinges, that they neyther kill nor eate any manner of beaste while it is whole and sounde, but when it is lame, or hath some impediment in the body, or whē it beginneth to wax old, or by chaunce is sicke: In all other thinges they are verye modest, for they content themselues with ve∣ry little meate. In the morning they drinke a vessell full of mylke, and afterwarde manye tymes neyther eate nor drinke in al the day. The apparell they vse is wel neere after one sorte, as wel men as women. The men weare vpon their heades a certeine thing, not very depe, which is playn before, and behind hath a tayle well neere a spanne long, and as much in breadth, and bicause it may stande close to the head, and not be blowne of for the winde, they haue certeine gardes sow∣ed with it, neere to the eares, wherewith they binde them vnder the chinne. The mar∣ried women weare a garment made lyke to a round basket, a foote and a halfe long, and the hygher parte of them playne much
<PB REF="10"/> after the fashion of a boote, being of many coulours, al garnished and edged about with silke, or Peacocks feathers, and layde ouer with many precious stones, and golde: and the rest of the bodye euery one apparelleth according to their habilities, the richest sort of grayne and silke after the same manner that their husbands do, they haue cotes made full of pleites, open in the left side, whereby they put them on and off, hauing four or fiue lowpes or buttons to keepe them together and fast to theyr bodies. The apparell they weare in the sommer, is for the most parte black, and that which they weare in the cold and rayny wether is white: these cloths reach no lower thē to the knee: the maydēs are not easily knowne from the married wiues, nor the women from the men: for almost they haue the like faces and apparel that the men haue, euery one equally and after one sort vse all their small apparell alike. When they en∣ter into battaile, some of them weare armour vpon their armes with certeine yron leaues, which they tye together with stringes, other vse leather many times doubled, and in the like sorte they arme their heades, there are few that vse Launces, and long swordes, but commonly they carry short swordes, three
<PB N="7" REF="10"/> spannes long, round with a sharpe edge on the side, and with these they wounde their sides when they fight. The horsmen are very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight, and great archers, and he is taken for more strong and valiant that is more obedi∣ent, and laboreth most to preserue the Em∣pyre. They fight without wages, and are ve∣ry subtill and diligent in their battailes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all that they take in hand, and very readye at al times to serue and obey. The Captaines and Princes enter not into battayle, but ra∣ther remaine without, and cry with a lowde <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yce vnto their men, warning and steng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hening them, and from thence they prouide diligently what is conuenient to be done. Somtimes they set vpon horses their sonnes and wiues, and also the Images of men to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>crease their army, because it should seeme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greater, and that it might be the more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onderfull and terrible to their enemies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen they fight, if it seeme good to them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey let them runne away, and it is not euill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ought of: when they should shoote their ar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wes they strippe their right arme naked, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d afterwarde shoote their arrowes with so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat strength, that there is no kinde of ar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our can defend thenemies, but that it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sse through. They go together and fight
<PB REF="11"/> in squadrons, and also flye together, and then they wound their enemies, that follow them with mortall woundes of arrowes: and af∣terwarde when they see the small number of theyr aduersaries, sodenlye they returne to battayle agayn, and then they shoote at them and their horses, and when it is thought that they are ouercome, then chiefly they remaine with the victorie. When they will geue bat∣tell to any countrey, they deuide their army, and set vpon them in all partes, that they cānot be succoured of any, and none of the in∣habiters can runne away, and so they haue alwaies victorie, and when they haue gotten it, they vse the same with great pride and cru∣eltie, not pardoning any that they take, ney∣ther children, women, nor olde folkes, they kill all without any difference, vnlesse it be the handy crafts men, whom they reserue for their worke, and such as they determine to kill, they deuide them among their pety cap∣taines, who appoynt to euerye one of their seruaunts ten, that so they may kill them, or more or lesse, as the number requireth, and when all are put to death with a hatchet like pygges, that all others should be terrified, they take of euery thousand man one, &amp; this manner they hang vpon a peece of wood a∣mōg

There can no straunger be admitted to the kinges presence, though he be of great dig∣nitie, and haue waightye affayres with him, but first he must purge him selfe. And if anye mans feete do smell, and come into the place where the Emperour is, although he be any of the Captaines, forthwith he is com∣maunded to be slaine: and besides this if any

There are many other thinges that these holde for sinne, without redemption: and in o∣ther respects they account it a small matter to kill men, to take other mens landes, and to rob the goodes of others against al right and iustice, and set light by the commandements of God, and with all this they beleeue that they shall liue after this life, for euer in an o∣ther worlde: but they knowe not how to de∣clare it, and beleeue that there they shall re∣ceiue rewarde according to their desertes.

Then the king saith, From hence forwarde I will you to vnderstand that the word of my mouth be my sword: all the people with great noyse and gladnesse confirme the same. Immedi∣atly, the principal and chiefe men of the peo∣ple take the king, and bring him down from the royall chayre, and cause him to sit vppon the ground, vpon a felt layd abroade, and say vnto him these wordes: Looke vpwarde, and knowe God, and then looke downe vpon the-felt whervpon thou sittest.

These <HI>Scithi∣ans</HI> at the beginning did possesse a small countrey, vntill by little and little, by their valiantnes and strength, they enlarged their Empire, bringing vnder their subiection many nations. These people at the begin∣ning made their abode neere to the riuer <HI>Araxes</HI> being very fewe in number, and litle esteemed, vntill they had gotten a Martiall King excelling in the feates of armes, vnder whom they enlarged their countrie and do∣minions, and it extendeth by that side where the mountaines lye vnto the Ocean Seas, and the lake <HI>Meotis</HI> passeth by diuers pla∣ces vnto the riuer <HI>Tanais:</HI> from the which ri∣uer

The <HI>Scithians</HI> were neuer set vpon, or at the least not ouercome of any other strange empire. <HI>Darius</HI> king of the <HI>Persians</HI> set vpon them, but in the ende returned flying away with great shame.

<P>There was neyther golde nor siluer amonge them, neither knew they what it meant.</P>
<P>Their meate which they vsed most common∣ly, was milke and hony. They cloathed their bodies against the colde and frost with the skinnes of wilde beastes, and rats. The vse of wooll and apparell was not knowne among them.</P>
<P>This was the manner of liuing vsed, and common for the most part among the <HI>Sci∣thians,</HI> but not generally of all: for as some of them were farre of from the rest, by distaunce of places, so likewise they differ in their liues, and had peculiar customes a∣mong them selues, of the which we wil speak after we haue declared the manners of the common sorte of people. The most parte of the <HI>Scithians</HI> reioyce to kil men, wherevpon they haue taken a custome to drink the blood of the first man that any of them taketh pri∣soner in battaile, he drinketh blood, and of e∣uery one that any of thē killeth, he presenteth the heades to the king, and for cutting off of the same, is partaker of any thing of value that is found about him, and otherwise not. They cut of the head in this sorte, they take the skull and cast out al that is in it, and take of the skin, and make it soft with their hands
<PB N="15" REF="18"/> as the skinne of a cowe, and so keepe it as a precious thing, and put it in the raines of their horses, and of this they triumph much: for he that hath most of these is accompted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he worthiest and valiantest man. There are many of them that sowe the skinnes of men together, as though they were skinnes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eastes, and vse them for coueringes, and o∣thers of them vse to pluck of the skinne from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e right handes of their enemies with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayles, and therwith couer the quiuer of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rowes.

<P>When the king giueth out a commaunde∣ment to put any person to death, for any mat∣ter or cause, he appoynteth all his sonnes to be slaine with him, but there is no hurt done to the women children. The leagues and a∣mitie that the <HI>Scithians</HI> enter into in their warres are in this sort. They take a greater-then vessell, whervnto they powre wine with
<PB N="16" REF="19"/> the blood of such as shall ioyne in friendship to them, wounding them selues with some knife, or cutting some place of their body. Af∣ter that in the same vessell they wette their swords and arrowes, halbards, and launces, and then coniure &amp; curse with many wordes, and immediately drinke that wine, not onely all such as enter into these leagues, but also their associates and companions, and especi∣ally those that are of greatest degree. The Sepulchres and Tombes of their kinges are neere to the cittie called <HI>Gerros,</HI> where the Ryuer <HI>Boristeneus</HI> beginneth, to be na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igable, and euen there, as soone as the king is dead, they digge a great square hole, and then take the body, and open it, and take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the bowelles, and make them cleane, the which they fyll vp with the small bowes of a willow tree, beaten to powder, and of <HI>Thimiamo,</HI> and with the seede of <HI>Apio,</HI> and Annise seede, and immediately sowe it vp againe, and laye it in a cart, and so carrye him from one countrey to an other, and wheresoeuer they receiue him, they do the like: but such as are of kindred to the king do cut of his eares, and also his hayre round about, they geue his armes many
<PB REF="20"/> small cuttes, and wound his forehead &amp; nose, they shoote throw his left hand with arrowes and after this they carry the kinges body vn∣to other people of his Empyre, who accom∣pany him vntill they returne where the first came forth, and after they haue carryed him among all his people from countrie to coun∣trie, they lay him among them that dwell in the vttermost partes of the Realme, where the Sepulchres of the kinges are, and after they haue put him into a place which is made vpon the Sepulchre, they shut him vp with lances made fast from one side to an o∣ther, and prepare good store of wood, and co∣uer him with a cloke, and in the other side of the Sepulchre, they cut the throtes of his woman which was best beloued of al, and al∣so of a seruaunt, a cooke, a driuer of Asses, a post, a page, &amp; a horse. They bury him with certeine cuppes of golde, and with the prin∣cipal of all other things, and after a yeare ex∣pired they do the like, killing alwayes the kinges chiefe seruaunts. These seruaunts of the kinges are the most principal of the peo∣ple of <HI>Scithia:</HI> for there is no slaue admitted to the kinges seruice. Of these they cut the throtes of fiftie, and of as many horses of the
<PB N="17" REF="20"/> most excellente, and after taking out the bowels, and hauing garmentes, and coue∣rings stitched togither, they take the horses and rayse them vp on their feete in a place made hollowe round about the Kings Se∣pulchre, and vppon them they place the ser∣uantes sitting, and set them in such order, that afarre off they seeme like to a compa∣ny of men on horsebacke that tarryed for the King. In this sort they vse the bury∣als and Sepulchres of their kings. Like∣wise, such as are next in degree to the king, and also the comon people haue their manner and fashion in their buryals: for as soone as one dyeth, the next of his kins∣folkes lay him in a carte, and carry him a∣mong his friends, from one to another, and euery one by him selfe receiueth him, and maketh great feastes, as well to the kinred as to others that accompany the dead bo∣dy. In this sort they carry him fortie dayes and after bury him, taking out first all that is in his head, and washing it, and vpon the body they put three pieces of timber, lea∣uing one to the other round about him, vpon the which they hang certeine woll. The men of <HI>Scithia</HI> wash not them selues, but the women wash their bodyes with water,
<PB REF="21"/> and rub them selues with a plain stone shut within a peece of wood of Cypres, or Ce∣der, or incēse. After they haue so washed thē selues, that they begin to smel, they annoynt all their body &amp; face with oyntments, &amp; so they remaine very cleane &amp; shining. The maner of the othe that they sweare, is by the kings chayr. And if they find any periured, which they knowe by the diuines, that haue the knowledge therof, immediatly without any longer tarrying, they behead him, and he loseth all his goods, which is giuen to such as accused him of periury. There are in <HI>Scithia</HI> other people called the <HI>Massagetas</HI> towards the part of <HI>Asia</HI> neere to the <HI>Caspi∣an</HI> sea, which are like to the people of <HI>Sci∣thia</HI> in apparell, &amp; also in life, by the which many beleeue y<SUP>t</SUP> they are <HI>Scithians.</HI> These fight both on horseback &amp; on foote, &amp; eyther way are almost inuincible. In battayle they vse arrowes &amp; launces, &amp; short swords that they always carry with thē. They vse much gold in their girdels, &amp; in the trimming of their heads, &amp; vnder their armepits, &amp; in the breasts of their horses. The heades of their launces &amp; arrowes be of copper. There is neither Iron nor siluer among them. Euery of them taketh out wife, but afterward shee
<PB N="18" REF="21"/> is common to all. Howe long they liue, no man hitherto could set downe any certain∣tie: for as soone as any of them beginneth to waxe olde, his kinsfolkes and friendes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eete together and kill him, and then seethe him, and after sacrifice him with certeyne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heepe, and then eate of that fleshe at a ban∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et which they make.

<P>Among this last sort, there is no woman brought to answer in iudgement nor other∣wise touched, although shee be a wicked woman, an adulteresse, or theefe. And as it is reported, there hath beene no man put to death among them at any time: for the feare &amp; reuerence which they haue to their lawes, is of more strength then any other constellation or sinne. They dwell at the beginning of the roundnesse of the worlde, and because they liue chaste, they be not af∣flicted with Caterpiller nor worme, nor hayle, nor pestilence, nor any other euils. The woman after shee is conceiued, is nei∣ther touched nor desired of any. Vncleane fleshe or forbidden, none eate thereof. Euery one is Iudge for him selfe, according to the righteousnes of Iustice, and therefore they are not chastened nor afflicted with those plagues that are vsed to come to others for their sinnes, and so they liue long, and ende their life without any disease. There are others which are called <HI>Tauroscythas</HI> of the mountayne <HI>Tauro,</HI> neare to the which they inhabite.

<PB N="19" REF="22"/> sacrifice is in this manner. After they haue made certein prayers, they wound the head of the man, and so kill him. Others say, they cast the body headlong from a great rocke, because her temple standeth vpon a high rocke, and they set the head vpon a stake. And some say, that the body is not cast downe from the rocke, but that they bury it. This diuell to whome they offer this sacrifice, they say is <HI>Ephigenia,</HI> that was daughter to king <HI>Agamemnon.</HI></P>

They of this coūtrey liue by robberies &amp; warres. There are others called <HI>Agatirsos,</HI> which are very politike, &amp; vse to weare vpon their bodies great store of golde.

They holde for a certaine trueth, and sweare, that euery yeare in certeine dayes they were conuer∣ted into Wolues, and afterwarde returned into the forme and shape that they were first of. There are others which are called <HI>Antropophagis</HI> because they eate mens flesh, whose manners and lawes are the moste rude and beastly of all others, which are among men. They liue vnder no maner of lawe. All their trade is in cattell. Their apparel is like to theirs of <HI>Scithia.</HI> They haue a language proper to them selues.

The citie that these possesse is called <HI>Gelona,</HI> of the which they are cal∣led <HI>Gelonas,</HI> and this is the head place of

<P>They hunt great store of wilde beasts. And of their skinnes make gownes for them selues to weare.

They are a people balde from the tyme of their birth, as well the women as the men.</P>
<PB REF="24"/>
<P>They haue flat and broad noses, and verye great beardes and a certayne sounde of a voyce wherewith they speake. They are apparelled like to the <HI>Scythians.</HI> They liue commonly of the fruite of trees. They care not for breeding of cattell, and there∣fore haue not many. Euery one hath his dwelling place vnder a tree, which in the Winter they couer with a white couering, and in the Summer it is not couered at all. No people of the worlde hurteth them, for they say that they are sanctified. They pos∣sesse no armour, neither to defende, nor to of∣fend: but rather themselues by perswasions and faire meanes, take vp all maner of con∣trouersies &amp; strifes that rise among them. Whosoeuer commeth vnto them, they fa∣uour and succour him. There are others called <HI>Isledones,</HI> which vse these customes: whensoeuer the father of any of them dy∣eth, all his kinred bring thither their cat∣tell, the which they kill and make bankets, and the like is done of the father of him that hath conuited them, and so they make their banket, eating the fleshe of the dead man, with the flesh of the cattaile. They flea and take off the skinne of the head of the dead man, and clense it of all that is therwithin,
<PB N="21" REF="24"/> and after gilde the same, &amp; haue it for their image, and make therevnto euery yeare very great ceremonies, and sacrifices.

In this prouince they celebrate their weddings with great ban∣kets, Songs, and Trumpets. They vse bathes. They deuide the yeare into 12 monethes, according to the twelue signes. The moste part of these people accompteth the yeare from August. They vse Crosse-bowes, and gunnes, and of all kinde of ar∣tillery, for they are the best handycraftes men in the worlde. They write vppon the leaues of trees, and make bookes of them. They make money of the rinds of Mulbery trees.

There is in this countrey many and very great Serpents, which the <HI>Catayans</HI> do eate in their ban∣kets with great affection. The princi∣pall citie in <HI>Cataya</HI> is <HI>Cambula,</HI> contay∣ning xxiiii. myles in compasse, and is foure square, and in euery square reacheth vi. myles. Some saye that it contayneth xl.

<P>This citie hath xii. gates, two myles di∣stant one from another. Euery gate hath ouer it a faire large house, wherein are con∣tinually a thousand watchmen kept to gard the citie. There is a wall that goeth to e∣uery one of these fortes, with their arches, where the king may passe into any of them. The great <HI>Cham</HI> his pallace is strong and very stately and faire.

It is a great Iland, and very aboundant of gold and precious stones.

All the trees of this Iland are of a sweete smel: there is in it much white pep∣per. The people of this Iland are faire peo∣ple, but euil in manners, for they are Ido∣laters:

There is in it great abundance of golde, and many Elefants and Apes, and manye small snayles, of the which, they vse the shelles for money. And as they write from <HI>Ophir,</HI> from whence <HI>Salomon</HI> caused gold

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>Yke as the gatherer of grapes, after he hath ga∣thered all that he can, &amp; made his principall ga∣thering in: yet after that he causeth the refuse to be gathered, &amp; maketh an after gathering. Euen so it will hap to mee in this worke: for at the conclusion I will not let to seeke agayne, if there be any notable thing to be found in these <HI>Indias</HI> and prouinces of the East partes, which haue not beene spoken of: and in the setting downe thereof, will keepe no other order, then to begin by the description and diuision of <HI>India,</HI> the which <HI>Pogio Florentino</HI> left written by the infor∣mation of one <HI>Nicholas</HI> a <HI>Venecian</HI> that trauailed those partes and sawe them.</P>
<P>All <HI>India</HI> is deuided into three partes. The first part is from the region of <HI>Persia,</HI> vnto the riuer <HI>Indo.</HI> The second part is the middest from the riuer <HI>Indo,</HI> vnto the riuer
<PB N="29" REF="34"/> <HI>Ganges.</HI> The thirde, called the farthest and last, is from <HI>Ganges</HI> vnto the ende of that which is knowen to be inhabited: and this exceedeth much the other in policy, riches, and good lawes. For it is certeine, that the men of this <HI>India</HI> haue sumptuous houses, and well wrought, and all things appertai∣ning to them very cleane and handsome.</P>
<P>There are very riche merchauntes which haue tables and table clothes, and cupbords of plate as we haue: and many of them are not without fourtie ships of their owne, for their affaires, that euery one of them is es∣teemed to be worth 80. thousand duccates. All these lacke bread and wine. They liue by Rice, flesh, milk, and cheese, &amp; also make their drinke with Rice grounde &amp; mingled with water: they make it a shyning red coulour with the iuyce of a certeyne kind of tree. They haue great abundance of hennes Capons, Partriges, Feysants, and other birdes, and wilde fowle, and sleepe in beds trimmed with golde, &amp; couered with quilts of cotten woll. They weare also clothes of linnen, &amp; sarge, tyed together with stringes of crimson and golde. The women vse to weare showes of thin leather paynted with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>de and silke, and haue bracelets of golde
<PB REF="35"/> on their armes, neckes, feete, and breastes. There be women that liue like harlots, and the <HI>Indians</HI> knowe not what sinne is. Some women vse to weare their hayre blacke, which couller among them is much set by. In the inner <HI>India</HI> which is that in the middest of the three, they consent not that one man haue more then one woman. In the other they haue as many as they list or can get. The manner of their buryals is not a∣like in all the <HI>India,</HI> but diuerse and diffe∣ring one from another. The foremost <HI>India</HI> exceedeth the others in sumptuousnesse of their burials: for they make vaultes vnder the grounde, wel and cunningly wrought, &amp; lay the dead body in a bed costly decked w<SUP>t</SUP> golde and clothes verye precious. In the middlemost <HI>India</HI> they burne the bodyes, &amp; the firste and bestbeloued wife of him that dyeth, is burned with her husbande. They weepe and bewayle them that dye dyuerse kindes of wayes. The <HI>Indians</HI> which are farthest within the countrey couer their heads with a sacke, and some put bowes of trees by the wayes, with verses written, &amp; painted papers. These play vpon Instru∣ments &amp; feede the poore: others there be that weepe three days for him that is dead,
<PB N="30" REF="35"/> and the kinsfolkes &amp; neighbours goe to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>use of the deceased, and carry meate with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, in such sort, that ther is nothing dres∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d in y<SUP>e</SUP> dead mans house in these iii. dayes. Such as bury father or mother, carry a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tter leafe in their mouth: and for the space <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a whole yeare neuer change their appa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell: neither eate nor drinke but once a day: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>either pare their nayles, nor hayre of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead, nor beard. The women bewaile such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s dye, by striking themselues vppon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reastes. Some put in certaine vessels of gold &amp; siluer the ashes of their Princes. The priestes which are called <HI>Bachales,</HI> eate of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beast, &amp; especialy of the Oxe, saying, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is very profitable for mā. They eat ryce, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earbs, &amp; fruites. They take but one wife who is burned with her husbande when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th. Throughout all <HI>India</HI> are founde one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind of Philosophers which are caled <HI>Brag¦manes,</HI> Astronomers &amp; also diuines. They liue long: yea, so long vntil they come to be 300. yeares of age. They vse great supersti∣tions, &amp; imaginatiōs. Throughout all <HI>India</HI> they worship idols, &amp; haue churches verye much like to ours, paynted within w<SUP>t</SUP> diuers figures. There are in them idols of stone, of gold, siluer &amp; Iuorie; som are 60. foote long.
<PB REF="36"/> When they enter into their temple, they washe them selues with cleane water, and lye downe vppon the ground, and holding vp their feete and handes, they praye, and after kisse the earth. They insence their sacrifices, offer meates to their gods, and after distribute them among the poore to be eaten. The <HI>Chambaytas</HI> onely write in paper, all the rest in leaues of trees: and of them they make bookes very faire to the sight: they write from aboue downewarde. There are among the <HI>Indians</HI> many and diuers sortes of languages. They haue a great nomber of slaues. The debtor vnable to pay, is driuen to serue the creditour. He that is accused of any crime, hauing no wit∣nesse, doth cleare him selfe by his othe only. There is no pestilence in the <HI>Indias,</HI> nor a∣ny other contagious diseases: and for that cause there is a great multitude of people. There are many kings which make an ar∣mie of more then of one Milleon of men.</P>
<P>It is sayed, that in the realme of <HI>Lambry</HI> are men hauing fethers about their secrete parts, both great and long like vnto Geese. And in <HI>Fansur</HI> is a kinde of great trees which haue a thin rynde, and vnder it is ful of meale very good, of the which they make
<PB N="31" REF="36"/> meate very excellent. In all these Ilands, because there is want of wine, they make it of certeine trees like to Date trees: of the which they breake the bowes, where com∣meth out certeine white and red licour like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wine, and is very excellent to drinke: and there is great store of it. All those people liue beastly, and haue no manner of lawe.</P>
<P>They worship the first thing that they see in the morning. They eate of all dead flesh good or euill, and flesh of mankinde, not ha∣uing care howe it dye. In the realme of <HI>Bisina</HI> are Munkeis of diuers sortes, and Vnicornes little lesser then Elephants, ha∣uing heads like to a Pigg, and a long black horne in their forehead, and their tongues sharpe and thornie with thornes, long and great. The Apes are little and haue their faces like to young children: they flea them, and then seeth them, and dresse them with spices in such sort, that there remaine no euill smell, and so eate them. There are in this countrey blacke valiant hawkes like to Crowes, and good for the game. In the same countrie, when any dieth, his kinsfolks eate him, &amp; keepe the bones in a chest. They kill all the strangers that they take, and forthwith eat them, if they be not redeemed.
<PB REF="37"/> The people of <HI>Nicuneya</HI> liue like beastes and go naked both men and women. They vse them selues like beastes in all thinges. In <HI>Nangama</HI> the people are idolaters, they liue beastly and eate mans fleshe; They are very cruell: they haue heads like to great mastiues, and teeth like to dogges teethe.</P>
<P>There is in this Ilande great quantitie of spices. And departing from this countrey declyning towards the West, one thousand myles, which are two hundred and fiftie leages, you shall come to the Iland called <HI>Saylan</HI> or <HI>Zaylan,</HI> which cōtayneth in com∣passe three thousande myles, and is the best Iland of the worlde, and the richest. The people are Idolaters. They haue aboun∣dance of Ryce and cattell, and wine made as we haue sayde. There are in it the best Rubies of the worlde, and many other pre∣cious stones, as <HI>Topacios, Amatistas,</HI> and others of diuerse sortes. The king of this Ilande hath a Rubie, the best of the world, a spanne long, and as great as an arme, and as redd as fire shining without any soyle or spot. The people of this countrie are very lecherous, and nothing worth for the warres. Neere to this Iland toward the West, fourtie myles, which are tenne
<PB N="32" REF="37"/> leages, there is a great prouince called <HI>Mohobar,</HI> which is called the greater <HI>In∣dia.</HI> This is the greatest and the best pro∣uince in the worlde: there are in it Pearles very great and fine, and it is deuided into fiue realmes: and all the men and women go naked, sauing they carry a linnen cloth, wherewith they couer their secrete places. Also the king goeth naked, sauing because he will be knowen, he carryeth a string at his necke full of precious stones, which are in nomber 54. in remembrance of so ma∣ny prayers, which he is bound to saye, in the honour of their gods, morning and eue∣ning, and vpon his armes, legges, and feet, he carryeth as manye precious stones, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enne riche cities are worth. This king hath eyght hundred women. In this realme are faire women, according to there fashion, they paynt their faces and bodyes. When the king dyeth, they burne him, and all such with him as kept him compa∣ny in his life. There is a custome in this lande, that such as are condemned to death, kill themselues for the loue they beare to their Idols.</P>
<P>In this countrey euery one hath as ma∣nye wyues as he can mayntayne. And
<PB REF="38"/> when the husband dyeth, they burne the bo∣dy according to their fashion, and the wo∣men of their owne accorde leape into the fire. All those are idolaters, and for the most parte worship the Oxe, saying he is a saint, because he ploweth the grounde where the wheat groweth, and therefore will not kill an Oxe for any thing in the worlde, nor eate of his flesh. And when any Oxe dyeth, they annoynt all the house with his tallowe.</P>
<P>These people descend of such as killed saint <HI>Thomas.</HI> The king and all the rest eate their meate vpon the ground. There gro∣weth nothing else in this countrey but Rice. All men and women do wash them selues twice a day, morning and euening, and he that faileth therein shalbe taken for an he∣retike. They are good in the handeling of their weapons: and fewe of them drinke wine. This countrey is of an intollerable heate, and it neuer rayneth in it, sauing at certeine times in Iune, Iuly, and August. There are in this region many Philoso∣phers, Necromancers, and Soothsayers, and blacke hawkes like to crowes, &amp; great Owles like to Hennes. In this prouince the body of Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle ly∣eth buryed in a small citie. And there liue
<PB N="33" REF="38"/> many Christians. The men of this coun∣trey do annoynt them selues with Benia∣min to make them the blacker: for the blac∣ker they are, the fayrer they thinke them∣selues to be: and they paynt theyr Idoles blacke, and the diuels white. In all this <HI>India,</HI> they obserue neyther lawe nor order in their maryages. By this course of the sea towardes the South, are two Ilands of Christians, thirtye myles one from the o∣ther, the one of men, the other of women: and the men go not to the women, nor the women to the men, but three monethes in the yeare, August, September, and Octo∣ber. The men children remaine with their mothers vntill they be seuen yeares of age, and then they go to their fathers. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ue by flesh, milke, fishe, and Ryce, hauing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o other victuals. In this Ilande is great quantitie of Ambar. <HI>Mandagaister</HI> is an o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Ilande towardes the South, distant from <HI>Escorcia</HI> neare 250. leages. It hath in compasse one thousande &amp; fourtie miles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich are 260. leages. It hath foure kings Mores. There is not eaten in it any other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leshe then of Elefants and Camels, where∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f there be many: and therefore there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat trafique with Elefants tooth. There
<PB REF="39"/> are founde in this Ilande certeine birdes that are called <HI>Nichas,</HI> so great, that the greatest Feathers of their Winges are twelue paces long: they are of so greate strength, that they take an Elephant, and carrye him vp into the ayre, and kill him, and after let him fall and feede vp∣pon him at their pleasure. <HI>Tanquibar</HI> is another Ilande moste noble, and lyeth in the same course, and hath in circuite 250. leages. The inhabiters thereof are Ido∣laters, and so great of stature, that they be like Giantes, and are of great force.</P>
<P>They be all blacke and go naked. They are to be wondered at. The women are foule and euil fauoured. They are strong in battell: for they esteeme not their liues.</P>
<P>Returning to the cities of <HI>Cataya</HI> and <HI>Tartaria:</HI> It is sayde, that the citie of <HI>Berengalia</HI> hath in circuite three score myles, which are fifteene leages, and that it hath nyne hundred thousande men, that can carrye armour. The men of that countrie take as many wiues as they list, who are burned with their husbands when they dye. And the king hath twelue thousande, of the which two or three thou∣sande
<PB N="34" REF="39"/> are taken vppon condicion, that when the king dyeth, they of their owne accorde shall burne with him, and to these is done great honour. In the citie of <HI>Berengalia</HI> three times in the yeare they make a greate feast to their goddes: they carrye their Idoles through the ci∣tie in procession, in the middest of two cartes, accompanyed with many people, and manye maydens finely arrayed, sing∣ing ioyfully with great deuotion: they spende three dayes in bankets, daunces and songes: and celebrate their marry∣ages with bankets, songes, and trum∣pets. They haue all kinde of Instru∣struments as we haue, except Organs, which they lacke. They dawnce as wee do, one after an other, which is a thing to be seene. They vse bathes, except it bee such as are neare to <HI>Ganges.</HI> The other washe them selues manye tymes a daye in tolde water.</P>
<P>Neare to this citie of <HI>Berengalia</HI> is a mountayne so called, in the which are manye Diamonds, and the mountayne is full of serpents, but they take them w<SUP>t</SUP> poli∣cye. They which dwell in these countreys, deuide the yeare into xii. partes as we do, &amp;
<PB REF="40"/> accompt the moneths like to the xii. signes. The most part recken the yeare from Au∣gust, by <HI>Augustus Caesar.</HI> In some of those realmes, they vse certeine small stones for money, which are called the eyes of a Catt. In others they vse certeine small Irons like to needles: in others, certeine papers wherein is written the name of the king. In some prouinces of the <HI>India,</HI> more for∣warde, they vse <HI>Venice</HI> duccats of golde: in others they haue money of siluer, and cop∣per: in others they make pieces of golde, and vse them for money. <HI>Malpuria,</HI> or <HI>Ma∣lapuria,</HI> or <HI>Milipar</HI> is an other citie in the prouince of <HI>Mahabaria,</HI> neare to the second entrance that the riuer <HI>Indo</HI> doth runne in at, where the body of saint <HI>Thomas</HI> the A∣postle is honorably buryed in an honorable church, where are resident well neare 1000 Christians of the <HI>Nestorians:</HI> of the which are many throughout all the <HI>India,</HI> euen as the Iewes are here among vs. In the pro∣uince of <HI>Macino,</HI> which <HI>Volaterano</HI> thin∣keth to be the region of the <HI>Seras,</HI> are ma∣ny Elephants. The king bringeth vp tenne thousande, and vseth of them in his warres. The men of this countrey take but one wife apeece. The women are verye lecherous.
<PB N="35" REF="40"/> They are all Idolaters, and in the morning they turne towards the Sunne. They wor∣ship the diuinitie of God in Trinitie. In this region is a ryuer called <HI>Daua,</HI> well neare as great as <HI>Ganges:</HI> the citie is cal∣led <HI>Dua:</HI> it hath 18000. paces in circuite: they write in the leaues of certeine trees, for in all the <HI>India</HI> is no paper, except onely in the citie of <HI>Cambayta.</HI> They eate Ser∣pents that are vi. foote in length, &amp; as gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as a man. They eate likewise Ants which are red and as great as crabbes. In the end of this region towards <HI>Cataya,</HI> are certeine Oxen, white, and blacke, with maynes and tayles like horses, hauing longer hayre.</P>
<P>The hayres of their tayles are very small, &amp; as light as fethers: they sell thē by waight: they are highly esteemed. <HI>Cibalechia</HI> is a royall citie, and one of the chiefest in all <HI>Ca∣taya,</HI> it hath xxviii. miles in circuite: and in the middest a pallace very strong and faire: and at euery end a round fort of foure miles compasse, for a house of armour, where is all kinde of armour, and engins necessarye, and that may be imagined for the warres. From the kings pallace to euery one of these fortes, is a wall with arches: from whence the king may passe to any of them.
<PB REF="41"/> <HI>Volaterrano</HI> caleth this citie <HI>Cubaleschia,</HI> and sayeth it hath 32. thousand paces in cir∣cuit: and it shoulde seeme to bee the same <HI>Cambalu</HI> which we haue heretofore spoken of. About fifteene dayes iourney from this citie is an other citie called <HI>Neptay</HI> new∣ly buylt, hauing in circuite thirtie myles and very full of people. <HI>Nicholao</HI> did af∣firme, that the houses and palaces, and all other things of these two cities were verye like to our houses, and that the men were modest, and full of curtesie, and very riche. Neare the citie of <HI>Paconia,</HI> he found vines, yet very fewe: for all the <HI>India,</HI> as is alrea∣die declared, lacketh wine, and grapes, and the grapes that there be, growe of trees, and therewith they make sacrifice to their gods.</P>
<P><HI>Coloen</HI> is a noble Citie, twelue myles in compas: it hath neare to the same much Gynger, Pepper, and Cloues. And there be many serpentes of diuers kyndes, some of sixe cubites in length wonderfull to be seene, but they do no harme. Others haue foure feete and a long tayle like to a dogge: they take them in hunting, and eat them, and report it to be verye good meate. Others there are of the length of a Cubite
<PB N="36" REF="41"/> with winges that haue seuen heads set in order by the length of their bodyes, and liue in trees: and flye swiftly, and are so full of poyson, that onely with their breath they kill. There are also cattes of the moun∣taynes that flye. <HI>Cochin</HI> is an other ci∣tie, that hath fiue myles in circuite, and standeth at the entrie of a ryuer, of the which it taketh his name: wherein there are sayde to be fishes in a manner like to men and women without any great diffe∣rence. And passing farther, they go to a∣nother citie that is called <HI>Colichuchia,</HI> conteyning viii. myles in circuits, which is the moste famous and noble of trade in all <HI>India.</HI> Here is much Pepper, Lacar, Ginger, and grose Cinamon, and manye o∣ther sweete spices. In this region onely the women take as many husbandes as they liste: and the husbandes agree among them selues, and euery one contributeth towardes the womans mayntenance, and dwelleth in his owne house, and when he goeth to the woman he leaueth a signe vp∣pon the doore. Euery manchilde is the husbandes, to whome the wife will giue him. Their inheritaunce fall not to the sonnes, but to the cousines.</P>
<PB REF="42"/>
<P>This citie, according to the signes &amp; shewes is <HI>Calicut.</HI> From hence fifteene days iour∣ney, he came to the citie of <HI>Cambayta,</HI> nere to the sea, whose circuite is xii. miles, &amp; is towardes the West, hauing great aboun∣daunce of <HI>Espico nardo, Lacat, Indico, Mirabolanos</HI> and <HI>Sarge.</HI> There is a cer∣teine kinde of Priestes that are called <HI>Bac∣chales,</HI> which haue but one wife, who bur∣neth her selfe with her husband when he dy∣eth. These eate of no kinde of beast, but liue with fruites of the Earth, Rice, milk, and wild hearbes. In this citie the priestes do preache to the people in the presence of their Idols. And many kill themselues for the honour of their gods: and those that so do, are taken among them for Saintes.</P>
<P>There are many Oxen of the mountaynes, that haue maynes lyke horses, and hornes so long, that if they turne their heads, they reche with them their tayles. Neare to this citie lyeth two Ilandes distant a hundreth miles a sunder: the one inhabited with wo∣men, and the other with men: one while the men passe to the women, another while the women to the men, euery one returning within sixe moneths to their owne Ilands: for they thinke, if they continued any longer

The <HI>Camfora</HI> is found in the Iland of <HI>Porne,</HI> in <HI>Monoch</HI> &amp; <HI>Bandan</HI> which are Ilands. Neare to these partes, are Nutmegs, and Cloues great store, The Iland of <HI>Sipangry</HI> hath much golde and great riches. The Iland of <HI>Petar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and both <HI>Iauas</HI> yeld great store of Pepper,
<PB N="38" REF="43"/> Nutmegs, Espique, of <HI>Galanga</HI> and o∣ther swete odours. In <HI>Madagassar</HI> are many Elefants, and great aboundance of Iuory very fyne.</P>
<P>The Ilande of <HI>Zauzibar</HI> is verye much like to this, abounding with Lyons, and many other wilde beastes. <HI>Nicolao Veneciano,</HI> as <HI>Pogio</HI> declareth, reporteth y<SUP>t</SUP> in the small brooks of the ryuer <HI>Ganges</HI> there were canes of a meruailous length, &amp; so great that a man could skarcely insorace them about with both armes, with the which they made small Boates to saile in, and at euery syde of those brookes are ma∣ny gardeynes and orchardes very pleasant and full of delyght. And there groweth a fruite verye like to Figges that they call <HI>Musa,</HI> which is exceeding sweete, yea, sweeter then honye. It is sayde, that the Ilande <HI>Taprobana</HI> conteyneth sixteene thousande tymes, a hundreth thousand pa∣ces in circuite, which amount to foure hun∣dred leages, accompting foure Englishe myles to euery leag. The men of that I∣lande were verye cruell in their manners, and both the men and women haue verye great eares, laden with <HI>Zarcillos</HI> of gold, &amp; precious stones: and they weare linnen
<PB REF="44"/> loth, and cloth of <HI>Sarge.</HI> And the men take many wiues, and haue lowe houses, by rea∣son of the great heat, and are Idolaters, and haue great store of Pepper, of that sorte which is called the greatest, &amp; of the toung, and plentie of Canfora, and Golde. In a certeine place of this Ilande, which they call <HI>Bateth</HI> are a kind of people called <HI>An∣thropophagi,</HI> to wit, deuowrers of men, in respect that they eat the fleshe of their ene∣mies, and keepe their heades for treasure: and he that hath most heads, is accounted most riche: for they make a trade with them and barter them away for other things. In <HI>Armenia</HI> the great, there is reported to be a fountayne, where water like oyle sprin∣geth, in so great abundance, that many shippes are laden therewith. It is good to burne for light, and to annoynt beastes. In the land of <HI>Tartaria</HI> towards the North, are doggs not much lesse then Asses, the which drawe a frame of timber, like as if it were a Cart, sauing that it goeth not w<SUP>t</SUP> wheeles, vpon the which two men may go, and they put two or foure dogges or more to it, ac∣cording to the burthen and necessitie. At the ende of this realme, is a countrie called <HI>Darknesse:</HI> because it is alwayes as darke
<PB N="39" REF="44"/> as the first houre of the night: &amp; the Sunne is neuer seene there. In this countrey are handsome men and women of person, but yellowe in couler. They haue neither king nor lawe, but liue like beastes. This coun∣trey ioyneth with one parte of <HI>Russia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Russia</HI> is a great prouince towardes the North, &amp; a strong countrey. There are in it faire men and women, and are Christians. They pay tribute to the king of <HI>Tartaria.</HI> There is great store of costly skinnes and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rres. There are in <HI>Russia</HI> many mynes of siluer: the countrie is very colde. In the same time <HI>Pogio</HI> declareth that there came certeine men from <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> which is par∣cel of the <HI>Indias</HI> and the countrey of <HI>Prester Iohn,</HI> and declared that they were of the countrey, nere whereunto the riuer <HI>Nile</HI> springeth: and also sayd that the same riuer springeth neare to the Equinoctiall at the foote of certeine high mountaynes, that are alwayes couered with clowdes: and that the sayd riuer groweth of three great foun∣taines: two of them which are 40. paces a∣sunder, &amp; these meete together at the ende of 500. paces, &amp; then make the riuer so great, y<SUP>t</SUP> it cannot be waded through. The thirde fountayne is a greater streame, &amp; a thou∣sande
<PB REF="45"/> paces from the other, and is neare to his riuer, and tenne myles from the o∣ther ryuers. They saye that there runne aboue a thousande riuers into the riuer of <HI>Nile.</HI> And in the monethes of Marche, A∣pril, and Maye, the rayne so much increa∣seth in that countrey, that they cause the ri∣uers to ouerflowe, and great floods to fol∣lowe thereof. They saye also that the wa∣ter of <HI>Nile</HI> is verye sweete, before it min∣gleth with other ryuers, and that it had vertue to heale the leprosie and scabbes, of such as washed them selues therein: Say∣ing that very neere about the place where the riuer <HI>Nile</HI> springeth, there standeth a citie where they were borne that had 25. myles in circuite, which is vi. leagues &amp; a∣boue, and that it was inhabited with peo∣ple. And they sayde, that this region neare to <HI>Nile</HI> was verye temperate and a∣boundant of all thinges. In so much tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thrice a yeare they had Haye growing and mowen: and twyce Wheate, and had abundaunce of breade and wyne, and of all fruites like to ours, but Almondes ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> want.

<P>They haue one king, who is intituled king of kings vnder God. There are in <HI>Aethio∣pia</HI> Oxen, that are crooked backt like Ca∣mels with hornes of three foote long. Their dogges be as great as our Asses. They can do more then Lyons, and they hunt Lyons with them. There are many Elefants that haue teeth of sixe foote in length. There are diuers other beasts, which differ from ours, and also birdes. They sayde, that in the de∣serts were serpents of 50. foote of length without feete, that would swallowe vp a whole calfe. Vpon the riuer <HI>Eufrates</HI> is a noble citie, whose circuite is of 14. thousand paces.
