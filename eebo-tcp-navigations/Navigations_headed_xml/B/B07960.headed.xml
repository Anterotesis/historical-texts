<HEAD><HI>From</HI> Gotlitz <HI>in</HI> Silesia <HI>the</HI> 25.
<HI>of</HI> October, 1631.</HEAD>
<P>This day the Imperiall Feild-Marshall hath sent hither to this Citie a warlike Commissary, with a request that wee-would be pleased to afford the Imperiall Army free passage, and grant them to be enquartered thereabouts. After this Commissary had waited with his Convoy before the Gates of the City for an answer, from twelue of the Clocke till two in the afternoone, was at last suffered to enter, and caused to propound his errand vpon the Towne-house, after he had made his speech and ended his proposition, he was wished to returne backe to his lodging, vntill they had fully delibe∣rated concerning his demand of so high a nature. This Com∣missary Generall finding the time of his expectation for an answer somewhat too long and tedious, returned backe to the Citie gate againe, before he was sent for, but was not suffered to enter before fiue of the Clocke. And when he had confer∣red with the Peeres and Counsell, they could in no wise agree together, whereupon he departed peaceably for that time. Afterward his Feild-Marshall commanded hither certaine Regiments of Souldiers, with some Ordnance, and deman∣ded obedience from the Citie, and willed to yeeld. Which we perceiving to be so earnestly intended, yeelded our selues, after some Articles of agreement considered and concluded vpon, and our Garrison departed out of the Citie, and we suf∣fered eleven Companies of the Emperours forces to enter. Lately also the Commander
<HI>Four</HI> was sent to <HI>Baudissen,</HI> and the Commander
<HI>Illo</HI> to <HI>Sittow,</HI> but those of <HI>Boudtsen</HI> will re∣sist: for they expect ayde and reliefe: and some Regiments of horse and foote are alreadie marching thither.</P>
<P>The <HI>Imperialists</HI> presse hard vpon this Citie and Country, ayming to extract provision from vs for the whole Imperiall Army; but hitherto is nothing granted. Neither can wee learne what is their intention, because the absolute resoluti∣on for the whole matter must come from <HI>Vienna,</HI> and they must be directed and guided by the order that they receiue thence. Wee doe exceedingly long to perceiue which way the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> will convert his proceedings, but it is very doubtfull.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<P>Now we doe at this instant receiue tydings, that the
<HI>Im¦perialists</HI> haue beene constrained to forsake the vpper &amp; low er <HI>Lusatia,</HI> which they haue abandoned, and diverted them selues toward <HI>Bohemia.</HI> At <HI>Dresden</HI> is lately arrived one Im∣periall and another Spanish Ambassador.</P>

<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> will suffer no posts or Messengers to passe these wayes. Certaine it is that he hath taken

All the Cities in this Country, and almost all the houses in the Cities are full of Corne, Wine, and other good provision, for it is a rich Country: so that the Souldiers are come into a good harbour, and will speed well, for they find great plentie of all things. The Cattle strayes and doe erre a∣bout the high wayes and streets, without any keeper. A good Cow is sold here for one Ryx Dollar, and a sheepe for a ve∣ry small value. His Majestie of
<HI>Swedens</HI> Army is very strong, as it is certainly esteemed, consisting of 60000. men, for e∣ver since his great victory, and since his comming into these parts, he hath had a great conflux of forces comming to him.

<P>Vpon Sunday last the Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> from the head-cheife quarter of his Army, sent forth 3000 men Horse and Foote, to take in the City of <HI>Wertheym,</HI> which his <HI>Majestie</HI> of
<HI>Swe∣den</HI> tooke but lately before, where 14 Companies of his
<HI>Majestie</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> were enquartered. The King having advertisement hereof, caused divers thousands of men to lie in
<HI>Ambuscado</HI> (parted in two parts) in a place named the
<HI>Taubergrond,</HI> he had also given notice to the Governour of the City of <HI>Wertheym,</HI> and charged him to retire if in case he saw occasion, and leaue the City, his <HI>Maiestie</HI> in∣tending some exploit that way. But before it came to that, the Kings foresayd Troupes consisting of some Horse and Foote, which lay in <HI>Ambush,</HI> before they could come neere the City, environed these
<HI>Imperialists</HI> round about, before and behind, and assaulted them so furiously, that 2700 of them were slaine dead on the place, so that but a very few of them escaped: 14 Ensignes were delivered to his
<HI>Maie∣stie</HI> at <HI>Wirtsburgh,</HI> and this exploit afforded the Souldiers very good bootie.</P>

<P>His <HI>Maiestie</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> was invested at

<P>Eight dayes agoe the <HI>Swedish</HI> haue taken

<P>The Lant-grave of <HI>Hessen</HI> with an Army of 12000. men, besieged the City <HI>Munden</HI> by the river <HI>Weser,</HI> and in one day shot very strongly from two batteries, thus attempting to take the City by force, those within yeelded up themselves by agreement, they departed out of the City with Bag and Baggage, and were convoyd to
<HI>Gottingen.</HI> The said Lant∣grave hath also taken <HI>Waerburg, Selkmersen</HI> and other places by agreement. And so marched to
<HI>Paderborn</HI> which Citty yeelded presently, and gave 50000. Ryxdollers to be freed from pillaging, and as we understand hath since taken that whole Bishoprick. The leuy of our Elector continueth still, but there are hardly any men to be gotten.</P>

It was formerly supposed that the said Generall would have marched to <HI>Hedelbergh</HI> and <HI>Man∣heym</HI> by that meanes to defend the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> but now we doe understand that he takes his way to <HI>Margentheym</HI> and so forward to <HI>Bavaria.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> causeth the 10. person, nay some say the
4. person to beare armes for defence of his Countrey, many thousands of them he hath enquartered in <HI>Donawert.</HI></P>
<P>Duke <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Lunenburgh</HI> hath beene with his Maiesty of <HI>Sweden</HI> at <HI>Wurtsburgh,</HI> where he had Commission gran∣ted him from the said King for the raising of 20000. men.</P>

<HEAD>Extract out of a letter from <HI>Maintz</HI> the <HI>16.</HI> of November.</HEAD>
<P>SIR, If you did now come hither againe, you would mar¦vell at the alteration that is here, you know there was but three Moneths agoe such boasting amongst us and such writing of pasquils against our Neighbours especially those of <HI>Vlm,</HI> and the Duke of
<HI>Wirtenburg,</HI> where the Monkes, Priests, and Nunns had taken into their possession many a goodly and rich Cloyster! But now we doe heare amongst us here, nothing but complaints, deliberations whether to flye and what to doe, &amp; on the other side we do heare, there they are now taking their turn and pay us in the same coin they lately received from us. Thus goeth the world: Our Generall <HI>Tilly,</HI> whose name I doe beleeve is rather vsed to encourage us then to affright the Enemies, who (we do well see) doe neither care whether he be alive or dead, is said to have a great Army and I beleeve he hath it; But what he doth with it I cannot tell. Hee hath beene long about to take the towne of <HI>Wertheim</HI> (as we have beene often enfor∣med by letters) wherein are but 5. or 600. Swedes! And yet he cannot master them, and meanwhile there is still one re∣giment and troupe or other of Imperialists, and of Loraines beaten, and I can assure you that the Loraines have no more mind to meete with the Swedes, for they solicite still to be put in garisons in such places as are farthest from their E∣nemy, and likely to be not troubled or assaulted at all. Thus we suffer more already by those that will make us believe to be our defenders, then we could feare at the Swedes hand, if we do no worse to them then the Countrey of <HI>Wirtzburg</HI> hath done, who is now in their Kings possession, but with∣all in peace and quietnesse. But of this I dare not say, what I thinke. The Kings troupes have lately assaulted one of the Imperiall quarters which was betwixt <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shopsheim</HI> &amp; <HI>Mer∣genthal,</HI> out of which almost all the Imperialists (having gotten notice of the Swedes comming) ran away and so by their light heeles saved their lives; For those that were not so quick were soone put to the number of the dead by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who slew about two hundred and tooke threescore prisoners, and withall all the Baggage that was left there, <PB N="13" REF="8"/>which was laden (but could not so speedily be convoyed away) upon above two hundred Waggons, all which besides many o∣ther Horses, Mules, and other cattell was seized by the sayd <HI>Swedes</HI> without any Notary, and carried away towards their roy∣all Campe neare <HI>Wirtsburgh.</HI></P>
<P>I am sorry I cannot tell you of so great matters and victories as formerly I did oftentimes, when both <HI>Wallstein</HI> (whilest hee was upon our stage of Warre, and playd his part) and
<HI>Tilly</HI> did every weeke, nay day, get some notable Towne, Castle, and place, where they found no body that durst oppose them, there having never appeared any great Army resolutely against them, except that of the Bores in <HI>Austria;</HI> Howsoever, I will give you what I receive, and tell you the truth, though it is not liked a∣mongst us here. We had yesterday Letters, and I have heard it confirmed this morning by a Colonell of ours, that 13. Fin∣landers (Horsemen) met with 60. Lorraines, and although the Finlanders saw them a farre off, and could have fled and saved themselves (for the Country is thereabouts not open) yet with a boldnesse and courage that defies and scornes death it selfe, they set amongst them; and without any delay, layd downe to the ground the most part of the sayd Lorraines; and made the rest which were yet 16. to yeeld, and so these 13. Finlanders (which our Country people feares now as if they were Fiend∣landers; that is, of the Land of the Divell) brought away to their King
16. Lorraines, without any complement, for I as∣sure you, that they could understand never a word the one of the others.</P>
<P>Our Army of the Imperiall and Catholike and Lorraine troopes, doth onely endeavor (as I doe perceive) to hinder the Circle of
<HI>Swaben,</HI> and other Townes of <HI>Alsatia</HI> &amp; the Countries thereabouts to joyne or to yeeld to the <HI>Swedes:</HI> But yet ne∣verthelesse we doe heare, that the sayd Countries and the chiefe Townes and Imperiall Cities have already or doe yet send and accōmodate themselves with that King, and put themselves un∣der his protection.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Norimbergh</HI> is altogether in love with him, and wil be trimmed after his owne desire, having already Swedish Engineers, that give order for new fortifications thereof; and there are made leavies for the sayd City, which they will enter∣taine in the sayd King of
<HI>Swedens</HI> service.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Ʋlm</HI> we heare are doing as much, although I have yet no particular notice of what they are resolved: But this I
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>know, that they (having some troopes for their owne defence ready) have hereby beaten backe some Imperiall forces, that were come out of Italy with much paine and labour, and craving from those of
<HI>Ʋlm,</HI> (but with some threatnings) some reliefe; namely, for every Horse 10. dollers, and for every Soldier 6. dol∣lers (and there were of them
12. Companies) they were for all answer, contribution and comfort, and without any compassion of their wearinesse and sufferings they indured by passing the Alpes, beaten back and driven to lie upon the Archduke <HI>Leopolds</HI> dominions, and so it is thought they will disband.</P>
<P>The K of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath caused the Castle of
<HI>Wirtzburg</HI> againe to be mended and fortified, that now it may be called what before it was esteemed, an impregnable place in the hands of Swedes. Let this suffice for this time, I hope for better newes shortly.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of another Letter the <HI>18.</HI> of November.</HEAD>
<P>I Doe not doubt but you have already beene informed, that the
<HI>Swedish</HI> forces have taken in the midst of the Catholike army the Old and new Towne of <HI>Hanaw,</HI> making the beginning with the Castle which they tooke by Pettarding and Escaladoes. We heare <HI>Francfort</HI> hath also made some accōmodation. But thereof you will be pleased to expect my next Letters. The Elector of <HI>Maintz</HI> hath kept some of the Spanish forces, that are sent to∣wards the <HI>Rhine</HI> &amp;
<HI>Palatinate,</HI> for the defence of his own Coun∣try, wherat his people (how great soever the feare is amongst their Churchmen) is very ill pleased All the Spanish forces that are come and comming hither towards the
<HI>Rhyne</HI> (which a∣mount already to 7000. foot and 32. Cornets of horse) are to be enquartered (as I doe heare) along the Country called
<HI>Rhinegow</HI> and so lye along the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> to hinder the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> to passe the same River.</P>
<P>Now concerning the Landgrave of <HI>Hessen,</HI> who hath a good army and in good discipline, he hath already taken all the Bisho∣pricks both of <HI>Paterborne</HI> and <HI>Corvay,</HI> where he hath made great store of money by way of contribution, whereby hee makes still new leavies: And withall he hath published a Proclamation in
<HI>Westphalia,</HI> whereby he doth call and admonish all
<HI>Westphalians</HI> that serve either the Emperor or Catholike league, to withdraw themselves out of that service, giving them terme of 6. Weekes, which past, and they not appearing and obeying, he will proceed against them (for many Noble and Gent: of that Country serue against the K. of
<HI>Sweden</HI> and his Allies) and their goods, with all rigour, &amp;c. More you shall have the next Post.</P>
