<P>The <HI>Wismarish</HI> Garrison is now in their March, there are aboue 3000. gone out. Amongst which arose a great diffe∣rence between the <HI>Swedish</HI> Generall <HI>Todt,</HI> and Colonel

Whereupon the said March is stayed and hinde∣red, 500. men are slaine and dispersed, 2000. men haue sub∣mitted themselues, and Colonel <HI>Gram</HI> is carried to <HI>Gripswald</HI> till he maketh satisfaction. In the meane time, the rest are marched towards

Whereupon the King, together with the Duke, and one Regiment travailed towards <HI>Nanzi;</HI> Wherefore it is thought that he will take possession of it, and not so soone quit it.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> hath sent an Ambassadour to the Arch∣duke <HI>Leopold,</HI> to cease treatie with the <HI>Switzers,</HI> and to lead away his Souldiers that lye in those parts, and that he should be more earnest in the affaire, seeing the <HI>Switzers</HI> are enter∣tained vpon the King of <HI>France</HI> his pay.</P>
<P>At <HI>Schorndorff</HI> the Ordnance and Munition, are taken away and carried to <HI>Dionsburg,</HI> also the Emperours Garrison is shortly to depart from thence, from which many Souldiers ranne away, and betooke themselues to the <HI>Swedes.</HI> It is said that the

<P>I cannot conceale from your Honors, how graciously it
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>hath pleased Almighty God to deliuer us and our Bysho∣pricke, from the apparent, cruell, and fearfull destruction, by our terrible enemy the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as also from the lamentable and vnchristian percecution of the <HI>Spanish.</HI> By meanes of the Prince Elector of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> who through the faithfull, well meaning, &amp; Heroicell meditation, interposi∣tion &amp; assistance of his Maj of
<HI>France</HI> with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> hath not onely for himselse but also for others, concluded and agreed vppon a Neutrality with the saide King of <HI>Sweden.</HI> In which matter we haue not been slack or negligent, but with the Godly and Religious assist∣stance of the said his Maiestie of <HI>France,</HI> obtained so much, that the said King of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath declared vs and our
<HI>Archbishoppricks</HI> to bee neutrall. By which meanes, the Peeres, of the whole <HI>Romish</HI> Empire, and all the allyed Christian Potentates, and Republicks, if they please may live together with more peace and contentment then e∣ver they haue done formerly, and you and they may aswell by the <HI>Swedish</HI> as the <HI>Spanish</HI> hold your selues excused.</P>
<P>Now to the end that this Neutralitie may remaine invio∣lable for vs and ours, and that by that meanes no incum∣brance nor misery may befall vs and our poore subjects, the said his Maj: of <HI>France</HI> as interponent, hath proffered his Royall assistance to vs and all other Catholicks, yea (if need bee) the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> himselfe also. And promised us, to afford vs all helpe and assistance and to take away and remoue all difficulties, and come with their Armies into the Empire to this end.</P>
<P>With these things you may comfort and helpe your solues, and giue thankes to God for the same. And with∣all pray, that the deed may follow so favorable a promise, and so this great punishment which now layes vppon vs, cease. And in the meane time it must be your care, that al
<HI>Spanish</HI> Insolencies dayly committed, and the persecuti∣ons amongst vs may be shaken off effectually, wherefore you shall publish and declare in all places the said Neutra∣lity, and withal: make knowne that the glory thereof must nōt bee ascribed to vs, but onely to God, and the
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>Prince Elector of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> who hath beene the meanes to obtaine this Neutrality for himselfe and others.</P>
<P>If now then after all this procurement, any will not∣withstanding persecute us, or (as it happened at <HI>Mentz</HI>) if hereafter under pretence of Spanish assistance, our whole Archbyshopricke should chance to fall into the <HI>Swedish</HI> hands, by murdering, burning and pillaging, which God deliver us from, and the Catholicke Religion, should be exterminated; we shall remaine guiltlesse, and the oc∣casioners thereof shall he bound to answer for the same to God, the Popes Holinesse, and all Christian Princes and Potentates.</P>
