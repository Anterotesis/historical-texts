<HEAD>THE Sisters Complaint For the Decay of the GALLANTS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Tune of, <HI>Will Womens Vanities never have End.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>YE Geudly Sisters! have a care</L>
<L>How you these Gallants trust,</L>
<L>A sadder Tale you ne're did hear,</L>
<L>Then now unfold, I must.</L>
<L>It hapned lately that a Fair Maid,</L>
<L>In <HI>London,</HI> would have set up her Trade,</L>
<L>But by a Gallant was made a Jade.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what shall we do?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>She thought him able, to perform</L>
<L>What e're he undertook,</L>
<L>And knew he could do her no harm,</L>
<L>For all his Lofty Look.</L>
<L>She was in hopes to have enough,</L>
<L>But when it came unto the proof,</L>
<L>This Gallant went out like a Candle Snuff.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what shall we do?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>First at the Tavern, they did move</L>
<L>Their Active Bloods, with Wine.</L>
<L>She saw that this would not improve,</L>
<L>Or further her design;</L>
<L>With that she Thought if this would not do 'it,</L>
<L>They'd have a Dram of Brandy to boot,</L>
<L>The Dev'l's in't then if he come not to't.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what shall we do?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>So hand in hand away they went,</L>
<L>To see how this would take,</L>
<L>And stayd not long for the Event,</L>
<L>Such Courage Brandies make.</L>
<L>For they had not been long at the Platter,</L>
<L>But at him, her Mouth did water,</L>
<L>And he, was eager to be at her.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what shall we do?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>They had no opportunity,</L>
<L>To play their Loving Game,</L>
<L>But where another Girl did lye,</L>
<L>No matter for her Name.</L>
<L>Who it seems did play Bo-peep,</L>
<L>Or, as they call it, slept Dog-sleep,</L>
<L>Because she did their Reckoning keep.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what shall we do?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>They did enjoy their wisht content,</L>
<L>Within the Naked Bed.</L>
<L>But e're her brisk desire was spent,</L>
<L>The Gallant, he, was Dead.</L>
<L>Yet, in an hour, it is well known,</L>
<L>He was but fower times up and down,</L>
<L>If none but such Men serve the Town.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what shall we do?</HI></L>
