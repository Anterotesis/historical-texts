<P>LEtters from the Town of <HI>Mount-Mellick,</HI> give the following Account: That by several Deserters that came thither from the Enemies Quarters, they understood that four Thousand <HI>Raparees</HI> were newly come to a place cal∣led <HI>Castle-Brock,</HI> where for the present they had Encamped themselves, but de∣signed speedily to undertake some Villanous Enterprise; upon which the Go∣vernour gave Orders for the Drawing-out of the Garrison Four Hundred Horse and Foot, and himself with <HI>Major Wood,</HI> Marched at the Head of them, in pur∣suit of the <HI>Raparees,</HI> Marching mostly by cover'd ways, in order to take the E∣nemy there at a Surprise, but the <HI>Raparees</HI> upon the first Appearance of our Men, took the Bogs, with all the Expedition possible, our Men fell in with the Reer of them, killed Forty on the spot, and took four Prisoners, two of which they immediately Hanged upon the first Tree they came to, and brought away with them Sixty Head of Black Cattle, Twelve Horses, as many Garrons, and some Baggage.</P>
<P>We have an Account from <HI>Mullengar,</HI> That the Garrison of that Place had Ad∣vice brought them, by some of their Souldiers that had been out a <HI>Raparee</HI> Hun∣ting;
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>that a great Body of <HI>Raparees</HI> were come to a place called <HI>Donow</HI> one of the Enemies Frontiers; upon which Six Hundred of the Garrison marched out, un∣der the Command of a Lieutenant-Collonel; The advance Party of our M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> consisting of Twenty Horse, and Fifty Foot, fell in with the Enemy, before the main Body of our Men could come up, and notwithstanding the <HI>Raparees,</HI> were above Two Thousand in Number (as the Prisoners since taken give an Account) yet they stood but the first Charge of our Seventy Advanced Men; but imme∣diately upon the Appearance of our greater Body, fled in great Confusion, we killed fifty eight of the Rogues, took Twelve Prisoners, and brought away for∣ty Head of Cattle; the Prisoners are ordered to be hanged, unless by Confession any of them can merit Pardon.</P>
<P><HI>Tallow</HI> the 30th, last <HI>Monday</HI> a party of the Garrison being out a Raparee hunt∣ing, the Evening Rouzed a party of them, which lay hid in the Hedges, within a Mile and half of the Town of <HI>Rathcormuch,</HI> Killed three of them, and took three more Prisoners, after which our Men went and burnt all the Cabbins on the <HI>Black Water side;</HI> one of the Prisoners we took has among other things, Confest, that they designed the next day to have plundered the Village of <HI>Rothcormuch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dundalk</HI> the 30th. Our <HI>Northern</HI> Mail being set upon and taken, some few Days since, by a Body of the <HI>Raparees,</HI> as it was bringing to <HI>Dublin;</HI> part of Cap∣tain <HI>Bellingers</HI> Militia Troop went out from hence in pursuit of the Rogues, and took the Harbourers of Robbers, who they Hang'd, and in a Wood near them, found four of the Horse the Raparees took when they carried away the Mail with Saddles, Bed-Cloaths, three Swords, three Fire Locks, and a pair of Pistols, with several other things of Value.</P>
<P>From <HI>Kinsale</HI> of the 25th. past we have the following Account: That one Mr. <HI>Lawrence</HI> coming from <HI>Virginia</HI> to <HI>London</HI> in <HI>November</HI> last, was taken by a <HI>French Privateer,</HI> and Imprisoned at a place within two Miles of <HI>Brest,</HI> till <HI>Easter</HI> last, when he was forced on Board a <HI>Privateer</HI> belonging to the port of St. <HI>Maloes,</HI> who sometime after he had been on Board, the <HI>Privateer</HI> took a <HI>Barnstable</HI> prize, laden with Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this <HI>Lawrence</HI> was placed on Board the said <HI>Barnstable</HI> Vessel as Master, and commanded to Sail her with the privateer to <HI>Lymerick,</HI> but the Ves∣sel being an Excellent Sailer, he took the Opportunity in the Night to part Com∣pany with the Privateer, and carried the Vessel Thirty Leagues beyond it, and sent his <HI>Irish men</HI> on Shoar for Water, and he with the Remainder of the Men ran away with the Ship, and brought her into this Port.</P>
<P>The Artillery, and Recruits of Men and Horses for the several Regiments being Arrived, all things are now in a manner dispos'd for our Armys taking the Field: <HI>Sarsefield</HI> has drawn down a great part of his Men to the side of the <HI>Shannon,</HI> in order to endeavour the maintaining a Pass that leads into the Province of <HI>Connought.</HI> By Deserters that came in here this Week, we continue to receive the confirma∣tions of the Lamentable Condition of the Rebel Army in <HI>Connought,</HI> particularly those in <HI>Lymerick</HI> and <HI>Sligo,</HI> that their Wants of all manner of Necessary's very much increase, so that great numbers of their regular Troops daily turn Raparees, and are in that confusion, that they even Rob one another; that their whole de∣pendance are on the <HI>French</HI> Succours from <HI>Brest,</HI> the Arrival of which they had no Account of when these Deserters came away, and that when ever they do Arrive, if they answer not their Expectations, the greatest part of them are resolved to lay down their Arms, and come in and Submit themselves to their Majesties Go∣vernment and Protection.</P>
