<HEAD><HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1699. To the Honourable the COMMONS in PARLIAMENT Assembled: THE CASE OF The Owners and Masters OF The Transport Ships, that were Imployed in the Reduction of <HI>IRELAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT in the Year 1689, their Ships were taken up for Transporting Forces, Ammunition, and Provisions, for Reducing that Kingdom to its due Obedience to His Majesty.</P>
<P>That in the Year 1694, their Accounts were Settled by the Commissioners for taking and stating the Publick Accounts of the Nation; and then amounted to the Sum of 330769<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> 7<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>That by Vertue of an Act of Parliament, passed in the Seventh Year of His Majesties Reign, the Commissioners for Transportation were Impowered and Directed, to make out Authentick Debentures to all and every the Ships hired for that Service, which were in Number about 730.</P>
<P>That in the Year 1695, Debentures were made out, and there appeared to be due, as principal Money, the Sum of 325305<HI>l.</HI> 13<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>That Interest for the same, at 5<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> hath been given on <HI>Coffee</HI> and <HI>Tea,</HI> with <HI>Pedlars</HI> and <HI>Hawkers,</HI> from the Year 1695, which expires Midsummer 1701.</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore, since there is a Bill depending before this Honour∣able House, for the applying the Forfeited Estates and Inte∣rest in</HI> Ireland <HI>to the use of the Publick; and so many Fami∣lies unto whom the Debt is due, being reduced to a very poor Condition, for want of Payment. It is humbly hoped the Transport Ships that carry'd the Army over, shall have some Relief from the same; or in what other way shall seem meet to the Wisdom of this Honourable House.</HI></P>
