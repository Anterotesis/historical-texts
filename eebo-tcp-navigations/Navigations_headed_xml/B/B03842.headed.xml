<HEAD>The Joviall Crew: OR, Beggars-Bush, In which a mad Maunder doth vapour and swagger, With praiseing the Trade of a bonney bold Beggar.</HEAD>
<OPENER><HI>To the tune of,</HI> From hunger, and cold, &amp;c.</OPENER>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<LG>
<L><HI>A</HI> Beggar, a Beggar,</L>
<L>A Beggar I'le bee.</L>
<L>There's none leads a Life so jocond as hée;</L>
<L>A Beggar I was</L>
<L>And a Beggar I am,</L>
<L>a Begger Ile be, from a Begger I came:</L>
<L>If (as it begins) our Trading do fall,</L>
<L>I fear (at the last) we shall be Beggers all</L>
<L><HI>Our Trades-men miscarry in all their Affayrs,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And few men grow wealthy, but Courtiers and Players</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Craver my Father,</L>
<L>A Maunder my Mother,</L>
<L>A Filer my Sister, a Filcher my Brother,</L>
<L>A Cauter my Unckle</L>
<L>That car'd not for Pelfe;</L>
<L>a Lifter my Aunt, a Begger my selfe;</L>
<L>in white wheaten-straw, when their bellies were full,</L>
<L>Then I was begot, between Tinker &amp; Trul</L>
<L><HI>And therefore a Begger, a Begger I'le be,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For none hath a spirit so jocond as he.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Boyes do come to us,</L>
<L>And that their intent is</L>
<L>to follow out Calling, we nere bind them Prentice</L>
<L>Soon as they come too't,</L>
<L>We teach them to doo't</L>
<L>and give them a staff, &amp; a Wallet to boo't,</L>
<L>We teach them their Lingua, to crave and to Cant,</L>
<L>The devil is in them, if then they can want,</L>
<L><HI>If any are here, that Beggers will bee,</HI></L>
<L><HI>We without Indentures will make them free.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We begg for our bread,</L>
<L>But sometimes it happens,</L>
<L>we feast it with Pigg, Pullet, Couny and Capons,</L>
<L>For Churches Affairs,</L>
<L>We are no Men-slayers;</L>
<L>We have no Religion, yet live by our Pra∣yers</L>
<L>But if when we begg, Men will not draw their purses,</L>
<L>We charge &amp; give fire, with a vally of curses</L>
<L><HI>The Devil confound your good worship we cry</HI></L>
<L><HI>And such a bold brazen-fac'd Begger am I.</HI></L>
</LG>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The second Part, To the same Tune,</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>We do Things in season,</L>
<L>And have so much Reason,</L>
<L>we raise no Rebellion, nor never talk Trea∣son.</L>
<L>We Billet our mates</L>
<L>At very low Rates,</L>
<L>whilst some kéepe their Quarters as high as the Gates</L>
<L>With <HI>Shinkin ap Morgan,</HI> with <HI>Blew-cap,</HI> or <HI>Tege,</HI></L>
<L>VVe enter into no <HI>Covenant,</HI> nor <HI>League:</HI></L>
<L><HI>And therefore a bonney bold Begger I'le be;</HI></L>
<L><HI>For none lives a life so happy as he.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>VVe never do prate,</L>
<L>In matters of State,</L>
<L>For fear we should come to <HI>Hugh Peters</HI> his Fate</L>
<L>VVhilst Scripture unfolders,</L>
<L>And Treason upholders,</L>
<L>Have lost their heads, we keep ours on our shoulders</L>
<L>Our Plots &amp; our Projects, are never so tall</L>
<L>To reach to the Top-mast of <HI>Westminster-hall</HI></L>
<L><HI>And therefore a merry brave Begger I'le be,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For none wears his Nodle so safely as he.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For such petty Pledges,</L>
<L>As Shirts from the Hedges,</L>
<L>we are not in fear to be drawn upon Sledges</L>
<L>But sometimes the VVhip,</L>
<L>Doth make us to skip,</L>
<L>And then we from Tything to Tything do trip,</L>
<L>For when in a poor housing-ken we do bib it</L>
<L>VVe stand more in awe of the Stocks then the Gibbet:</L>
<L><HI>And therefore a merry mad Begger I'le be,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For when it is night, to the Barn goes he.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>VVe throw down no Alter,</L>
<L>Nor ever do falter</L>
<L>So much, as to change a Gold-Chain, for a Halter:</L>
<L>Though some men do flout us;</L>
<L>And others do doubt us,</L>
<L>we nere go without forty peices about us;</L>
<L>But many brave fellows are fine &amp; look fiercer</L>
<L>That owe for their Cloths to the Taylor and Mercer:</L>
<L><HI>And if from the Stocks I can keep out my feet,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I fear not the <HI>Compter, Kings-bench</HI> nor the <HI>Fleet.</HI></HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes I do frame,</L>
<L>My self to be lame;</L>
<L>and when a coach comes, I do hop to my game:</L>
<L>VVe seldome miscarry,</L>
<L>Yet never do Marry,</L>
<L>By the Gowns Common-Prayer, nor the Cloak Directory,</L>
<L>But <HI>Harry &amp; Mary</HI> (like birds of a feather)</L>
<L>do nothing but kiss, laugh, &amp; lye down together</L>
<L><HI>Like Piggs in the pease-straw, intangld they lie</HI></L>
<L><HI>Till there they beget such a bold Rogue as I.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To summe all in brief,</L>
<L>VVe live by relief,</L>
<L>And pray for King <HI>Charles,</HI> our Commander in chief:</L>
<L>God bless all the Peers,</L>
<L>The wise Over-seers,</L>
<L>that they may consider the poore <HI>Cavaliers,</HI></L>
<L>For if they let them but lower to fall,</L>
<L>The'l take our profession &amp; begger us all:</L>
<L><HI>And then it will be but a folly for me,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A merry soul'd, bonny bold Begger to be.</HI></L>
