<HEAD>The Continuation of our Weekely NEWES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Venice</HI> the <HI>7.</HI> of <HI>Iune, 1632.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Rom <HI>Mayland</HI> wee receiue tydings that the Commaunder and Governour there hath sent <HI>Serbellone</HI> with his foot-forces against <HI>Riva;</HI> and <HI>Philippo Spinola</HI> against <HI>Como,</HI> with the horse∣men: for feare least the Duke <HI>de Rohan</HI> should fall into <HI>Italy</HI> with the <HI>French</HI> forces and the <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bunters,</HI> or <HI>Grisons.</HI></P>
<P>Wee vnderstand by Letters from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that the great tempestuous broyles are somewhat of late appeased. The great <HI>Turke</HI> forseeing the exstreame misery and bloud∣shed which was like to follow, hath beene the meanes him∣selfe to still the Commotion; and what by fayre speeches, promises, and gifts, hath qualified and quieted the <HI>Ianizaries:</HI> so that now the state is in a better plight than formerly; but God knows how long this fayre weather will hold, and how soone a thundring shower may bluster forth.</P>
<P>From <HI>Mantua</HI> we are certified that <HI>Don Camillo Gonzaga</HI> is departed thence, and hath betaken himselfe into the Empe∣rors seruice. And that Generall <HI>Walsteyn</HI> Duke of <HI>Fridland,</HI> hath given him the command of 1000. Curassiers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Ratisbon</HI> the <HI>10.</HI> of <HI>Iune.</HI></HEAD>
<P>All is indifferently quiet for the present. The March is vp and downe, too and fro. The Souldiers daily ride a pillaging for bootie. <HI>Bavaria</HI> and the <HI>Vpper-Palatinate</HI> doe now goe to wrack, and are vtterly ruined. This Citie is fortified; Gods religious worship is here brought to its forme and ancient
<PB N="1" REF="2"/>state, and freely exercised. Vpon <HI>Trinitie Sunday</HI> there was Service and Sermons in both the new Churches; where many thousand people came together with great joy and exultation to serue God: and for very joy, many teares were shed. The Sermons were much applied vnto the present miserable estate and calamities of the Church.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Norimberg</HI> the <HI>18.</HI> of <HI>Iune.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We receiue newes out of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> that the Elector of <HI>Sax∣on</HI> hath forsaken almost all he did possesse in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> since the Citie of <HI>Prague</HI> was surrendred againe to the Duke of <HI>Fridland:</HI> and that he keepes nothing there, but onely the Citie of <HI>Eger</HI> and the Castle <HI>Elenbogen;</HI> and that he with the rest of his Army, is gone backe towards <HI>Dresden</HI> and to <HI>Tir∣na,</HI> which are distant one from the other but two leagues. Therefore the said Duke of <HI>Fridland</HI> was resolved to pursue and follow him with his Army, consisting of neare 40000. men. The said Generall <HI>Fridland</HI> hath also sent an Army into <HI>Silesia</HI> against the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgs</HI> forces there; by reason whereof the said Elector doth excuse himselfe, that he cannot send any succours to him of <HI>Saxon.</HI> And therefore it is conceiued, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> (being made acquainted with all this) hath beene induced to change his other designes and resolution. Thus his Majestie hath forsaken <HI>Bavaria,</HI> onely he hath well fortified and strengthened with sufficient Garrisons, <HI>Augsburg, Donawert,</HI> and <HI>Raine:</HI> And that in his absence, the promises made vnto him may be the better kept, and the monies due at <HI>Munchen</HI> and els-where for contribu∣tion and vpon agreement, the surelier payd: his Majesty hath caused many persons of qualitie, as Burgemaisters, Counsel∣lors, and other Ecclesiasticall persons to be brought from thence to <HI>Augsburg,</HI> thereto remain as Hostages. Two Dukes of <HI>Saxon Wimar</HI> (named, as I vnderstand, <HI>Ernest</HI> &amp; <HI>Bernhard</HI>) haue beene left by his Majestie about <HI>Memmingen</HI> and in the vpper part of the Circle of <HI>Swaben,</HI> with an Army of aboue 8000. men. And the Duke Administrator of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> is
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>to joyne 8000. more with them; and withall to obserue toge∣ther, the actions both of Generall <HI>Ossa,</HI> and of the Arch-duke <HI>Leopolds</HI> forces. The said Dukes of <HI>Saxon Wymar</HI> haue lately defeated the troupes of the Souldiers and Boores commanded by the Earle of <HI>Embs,</HI> taken the said Earle with his Countesse; and now they are marching towards <HI>Lindaw.</HI></P>
<P>On this very day his Majest. of <HI>Sweden</HI> is at <HI>Furt,</HI> one league distant from hence, where I vnderstand he doth keepe his ge∣nerall Rendezvous, and mustereth 20000. good men. In his passage this way, he hath taken in <HI>Aichstadt,</HI> because the Ma∣gistrates there had not kept the Treatie they made formerly with his Majestie; and had never payd the promised Contri∣bution. His Majestie hath also beaten with Canons, &amp; quick∣ly taken in the strong Towne and Castle (a good place and of great consequence) called <HI>Pappenheym,</HI> belonging to Generall <HI>Pappenheym.</HI> The people that went to see the Mustering doe much extoll how braue an Army it is: In this Citie there hath beene made bread for the said Army of aboue 200. bushels of Corne, which with other victualles hath beene sent thither. There was also made very great preparation for the entertain∣ment of his Majestie; for it was hoped he would ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e come into the Citie, as indeede the Magistrates did humbly invite him. But he excused himselfe, &amp; I heare his Majestie amongst other merry words sayd: <HI>He had at this time a greater desire to see Walsteyn then Norimberg.</HI> His Majestie hath dispatched from hence 2000. horse towards <HI>Coburg,</HI> there to joyne with other forces, to obserue and hinder (as some doe suppose) <HI>Pappenheym,</HI> if he should endevour to passe: There haue beene stayed in this Citie all Waggon-horses, for the carriage of the Ordnance towards <HI>Forcheim,</HI> which is sayd shall now be be∣sieged; Yea some doe beleeue, that the King himselfe hath an enterprise against it; But I dare boldly say, that no body as yet knoweth what his Majestie intendeth to doe, and therefore we must expect till time doth discover it.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> hath beene these three dayes (before the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> a rived at <HI>Furt</HI>) in this Citie. The Magi∣strate doth much respect and honour him, and hath presented
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>him after the wonted manner, with a present of Fish, Wine, Oats, &amp;c. His Majestie gaue yesterday a visite vnto the Prin∣cesse Palatine of <HI>Sultsbach,</HI> and to the Marchionesse Dowager of <HI>Onspach.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Bavarian</HI> forces that lye in the <HI>Ʋpper-Palatinate,</HI> haue made an inrode into the Marquisate of <HI>Onspach,</HI> and haue pil∣laged the chiefe Towne called <HI>Onspach.</HI></P>
<P>It is certainly beleeved, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> will take his March through the <HI>Ʋpper-Palatinate</HI> into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> di∣rectly to <HI>Eger;</HI> and thereabouts to joyne with the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> his Armie; for we doe get notice, that there is sent to <HI>Eger</HI> great store of victualls and other provisions: His Ma∣jestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath also sent backe to the said Elector some Ambassadors, to giue him notice of what he is desired to doe, and to represent vnto him the ill and suspitious behaviours of his Lieutenant-generall <HI>Arnheim.</HI> Wee doe not yet know, whether King <HI>Frederick</HI> of <HI>Bohemia</HI> will follow his Majestie of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or whether he intends to goe to the <HI>Lower Palati∣nate,</HI> as some doe presume. Of all which as soone as we shall be sure, you shall receiue newes from vs.</P>

<HEAD>The Copie of a Letter which Count <HI>Henry vanden Bergh,</HI> Ge∣nerall of his Majesties Army, wrote to the Arch-Dutches <HI>Infanta Isabella,</HI> concerning the discontent, and displeasure which he hath received, and his resolution for the welfare of the Countryes.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Soveraigne Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot but with all possible obedience vnto your High∣nesse declare vnto you, and complaine of the evill vsage, and great wrong done vnto me; forasmuch as I am depri∣ved of my Government through want of men, and now would they also if they could depriue mee of mine honour, credit, &amp; reputation. And all this without having any respect vnto all the faithfull services done by me within, and during the space of 40. yeares: as also, of those of mine house and kindred, we having lost six brothers in the service of the
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>King of <HI>Spaine.</HI> Likewise to make complaint of the ill go∣vernment which is in the Countrie, and the decay and ruine of the same, and of the <HI>Catholicke, Apostolicall, Roman Re∣ligion,</HI> through the progresse and good successe of the Armies of our Enemy. Moreover, of the neglect and disrespect of the Nobilitie and Gentrie of our Countrey and Nation, and all of Vs in generall; for the <HI>Spanish</HI> alone will rule and governe all, and so inrich themselues (as indeed they doe) to the losse, dammage, and prejudice of the poorer sort of people: and that with such a violent and strong domineering hand over all our Nobilitie, Gentrie, and Commonaltie, that they haue already subdued them, and brought them all vnder their commaund. That also they labour to continue a perpetuall warre in these <HI>Netherlands.</HI> That they are the cause, (as your Highnesse is well acquainted with) that the truce was not contracted; and that they will ever take the vpper hand, and highest places, and preheminence, with contempt of all other Nations. I am sure enough that your Highnesse doth earnestly wish and desire that all things might be reduced to a better state and condition; and that it is now more than time that the States of the Countrey should vndertake some o∣ther and better course vnder the commaund of your High∣nesse, for the extirpating and excluding of the <HI>Spanish.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas some two yeares agoe, your Highnesse in the name of his Majestie, caused the commission to be given vnto me, for supplying the Office and place of Generall of the field, seeing the Countries now falling into a totall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uine; I am resolved to execute that place and Office, for the ser∣vice, profit, and welfare, and easement, and disburdening of the Countrey; as also, for the maintenance of the priviledges thereof, and the vpholding of the <HI>Catholike, Apostolicall,</HI> and <HI>Romish Religion.</HI> And that I may the better testifie my care, loue, &amp; singular affection, which I do beare the State, &amp; wel∣fare of the Countrey; I am resolved to employ all my meanes to helpe to restore the same to a prosperous and happy e∣state; and to cause the same to enjoy an assured tranquillitie and peace: to the end that your Highnesse might governe
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>with more quiet and safetie; as also, with more contentment and satisfaction vnto the whole Countrey: which now is go∣verned (through the interest of some particular persons) with extreame pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>judice of all the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>And indeed I doe suppose, that I cannot performe a better or worthier service vnto your Highnesse, (for the preserva∣tion of the whole Countrey) than this is like to proue. Wher∣fore I haue retyred my selfe into this City of <HI>Liege,</HI> where I will expect and wait for that prosperity and good lucke which it shall please God to afford me, for the furtherance and accomplishment of these my so just designes. Wherefore I will earnestly intreat the Almightie, that he will be pleased to preserue your Highnesse in a long, prosperous, and happy life, and good estate; like as all Christendome at this pre∣fent standeth in need of his helpe, and I in particular.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VVHereas I doe certainely know that all the world will speake and censure diversly, concerning the losse of my government; and that many will blame mee (though vnjustly for the same: I cannot but acquaint your Honours, that because it was ordained (against my will and good liking) that the Souldiers should be drawne off, which then I stood in so great need of, for the preservation of the Countrey. Yea, and notwithstanding that I had given intelli∣gence and notice, how that the Enemy was about to assem∣ble
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>his forces at <HI>Moock,</HI> not farre from my Government, by which meanes I am at this present sensible of a great losse. As also by reason of the evill vsage which I haue received, &amp; doe yet daily receiue, for recompence of all those faithful ser∣vices, which I haue done his Majestie during the space of 40, yeares: having (as your Honours doe very well know) lost in his Majesties service six brothers. And whereas I still continue a most naturall affection and inclination to the pro∣sperity and welfare of the Countrey, it sorely grieues mee to see matters brought to such a lamentable passe, and the State in this so woefull a case as it is now in: this hath caused mee to send these printed lines to your Honours, wherin you shall find &amp; see the resolution which I haue taken for the redresse, welfare, and happinesse of the Country, and of vs all in gene∣rall: well hoping, yea trusting, that it will not onely be agree∣able and acceptable to your Honours, but also that you will moreover be pleased, to contribute to this my designe and en∣terprize, to the end wee may obtaine a golden and a happy peace in the state of this Countrey. Wherefore I am further willing to declare vnto your Honours, that this discontent &amp; displeasure of mine hath partly proceeded from that grudge and evill conceit, which the Marquis <HI>de Leganes</HI> (whose cre∣dit and reputation your Honours are well acquainted with∣all) hath taken against me: and those evill services and turnes which he hath done me in <HI>Spaine,</HI> at the Court, and with his Majestie: and all vpon these two reasons especially.</P>
<P>The one was, because it was the meanes of preventing and hindring the City <HI>Bruxels</HI> from being pillaged, when the Ar∣my was before it, and when the Citizens were in such per∣plexitie, and knew not how to yeeld that which was de∣maunded of them. And moreover he himselfe was in such a passion, that he plucked the feathers from his hat in my pre∣sence, and in the presence of many more. Whereas the Mar∣quis <HI>Spinola</HI> of happy memory, gaue mee great thankes for that I was the meanes of freeing those Citizens from such a danger, when they opened the gates to the end they might not incurre the extreamest danger.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<P>The other reason was, because (as the aforesaid Marquise <HI>de Leganes</HI> once vpbraided me in a vehement anger and pas∣sion, in the presence of the a foresayd Marquise <HI>Spinola</HI> of happy memory) I had sometimes giuen the vauntguard to the <HI>Italians,</HI> which (as hee thought) was due to none but the <HI>Spanish</HI> according to the order and direction of the Kings Maiestie. Moreouer I doe perceiue, and finde it suffi∣ciently that the <HI>Spanish</HI> doe desire my death, which also by this appeared, when they hauing on a time my picture or portraicture, did shoote the same thorough and thorough, which is at <HI>Bruxels</HI> in the streete neere vnto the stone-gate. And which is more then all this, they would neuer send me the Letter which according to their own relation was writ∣ten by the King to me concerning the office or place which his Maiesty did proffer me in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and yet notwithstan∣ding they would know my minde and declaration concer∣ning the voyage into <HI>Spaine</HI> before euer the Letter was de∣liuered into my hands. These and many other discontents so well grounded, and giuen mee vpon seuerall occasions (which would be too long to relate) and would cause all the world to wonder, how possibly I could so patiently beare them, as also of those manifold wrongs which your honours haue suffered these many yeares, and doe yet daily suffer, and that withall, you now see the poore people so mi∣serably oppressed and ruinated; the souldiers not payd, but euill entreated doe giue me great hopes that your honours will contribute vnto, and assist and further mee in this my designe and resolution, and that hence forward you will loath and abhorre the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gouernment, which <HI>Spaniards</HI> by their daily meetings and assemblies (which we call <HI>Iun∣tas</HI>) haue vtterly spoyled and depraued the whole businesse and matter. Wherefore it will bee necessary that your ho∣nours be pleased to find out another course vnder the Go∣vernment of her Highnesse the <HI>Arch-duchchesse;</HI> for the safety, rest, peace, and welfare of the Country, vnto which good worke I am assured both Kings and Princes are willing to assist &amp; to contribute with all their power.

<P>As for newes you shall haue this little, which is asmuch, as the shortnesse of time will permit mee to set downe, to wit, that we haue (as yet) no tydings that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army hath fought with that of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> before <HI>Mastricht:</HI> True it is that they haue beene neere one vnto the other for this seauen nights space, but the <HI>Hollander</HI> is so well entren∣ched, that the other doth not know where to attacque him vnlesse with great losse of men, and vncertaine successe, and therefore holds it better, to endeauour to cut off the meanes of victualing the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Army, about which (as we vn∣derstand) they are now in hand. In the meane space, there is a rumour that the <HI>Rhyne-graue</HI> hath passed ouer the <HI>Mosell</HI> with great forces, &amp; is comming into this land to doe more hurt, so that the common people are in a great Quandary, we haue (euery day) in this City a watch of a thousand men which stand at the Gates, who are all Citizens, and we expect out of hand a thousand souldiers to come, and two Cornets of horse, which newes doth much discontent, but there is no remedy, forasmuch as their loyalty is much su∣spected, and the reason (in particular) mouing thereunto is this, vpon <HI>S.

<PB N="9" REF="6"/>in the Morning (by order from Court) the Drums began to beate and to call vp the Citizens to Armes, but all in vaine, for the parties who had made the great noyse were gone before the others were assembled, neuerthelesse there is a Proclamation, that whosoeuer can appeach any of the foresaid offenders, shall haue 500.

<P>We haue tydings, how that part of <HI>Walsteyns</HI> forces com∣ming out of <HI>Silesia,</HI> marched through <HI>Gorlitz</HI> in <HI>Lusatia,</HI> without stay or hurt doing: and that they went directly to∣wards <HI>Bud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssen,</HI> the chiefe of the 6.

<P>Here I affoord you the briefe summe and abstract of what hath passed since <HI>Monsieur</HI> came before this City. After his declaration was published on the 13. of this Moneth at <HI>Dandelot</HI> signed. <HI>Gaston et Goulas.</HI> On the 17. day, the Lord of <HI>Vellepelle</HI> his Gentleman accompanyed with a Trumpe∣ter presented vnto the whole Body of this City a Letter from <HI>Monsicur,</HI> and returned backe with this answer that if they would deliuer them the Letter they would send it to the King, but that they would in no wise trust nor giue eare to <HI>Monsieur.</HI></P>
<P>The 18. day hee returned with the Lord <HI>Fargye</HI> and two Trumpetors, who accorded to their former demaund, that the conference which <HI>Monsieur</HI> required to haue with them, was onely to desire them to assist him that his Army might subsist. They returned with the same answer they re∣ceiued formerly, and that withall they should acquaint <HI>Mon∣sieu</HI> the Duke <HI>Delboeuf</HI> with their refolution.</P>
<P>The 19. day earely in the Morning, they sent a Drumme vnto <HI>Monsieur</HI> with this message that they could not hear∣ken to any of his propositions vntill they did fully vnder∣stand the Kings pleasure.</P>
<P>The afternoone following, there happened a small skir∣mish by reason of some Sheepe which the Souldiers and
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>taken. <HI>Monsieur</HI> lodged that day at <HI>Mesiguy,</HI> two miles from hence, and on the 20. came to <HI>Gilly</HI> which day the Marquise <HI>D'Espoisse</HI> accompanied with 80. Gentlemen en∣tred into this City.</P>
<P>On the 21. day a Trumpeter brought Letters againe from Monsieur, which Letters were receiued by those that com∣manded at the Gates, and were sent to the King not yet ope∣ned. In the same day the house of the President <HI>Bercheres</HI> happened to be on fire, and was quite burnt downe, but hee protested that he was hardly sensible of that losse in respect of the great contentment which hee conceiued in that hee had done his Maiesty such faithfull and loyall seruice, as his Maiesty himselfe did testifie by Letters which he had newly receiued from him.</P>
<P>Monsieur hauing passed the Countersharpe of <HI>Nuis</HI> lodged at the Village <HI>Migny</HI> two miles from <HI>Chaalon,</HI> where the Marquise <HI>De Varennes</HI> came vnto him with all speed and diligence.</P>
