<P>CAptain <HI>Cole,</HI> with the Squadron under his Command, and the Ar∣tillery-Ships, arriving in the Bay of <HI>Galway,</HI> the General sent Or∣ders for their immediate Sailing to the River <HI>Shannon,</HI> (as you have already heard:) which said Orders being effectually executed, he was not long arrived in the said River, before a <HI>French</HI>-Frigate taking them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or a Fleet of their own Nation, fell in with them near a Place called, <HI>Car∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ickaholt</HI> and was made a Prize; The Ship was very Richly Laden, having among other Rich Goods, all the Baggage, Coaches, Charging Horses, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> belonging to the late Monsieur <HI>St. Ruth:</HI> And, at the same time, two other Vessels, wherein were <HI>Sarsefield</HI>'s, and several other Ladies of Quality, with all their rich Effects, very narrowly escaped; which be∣ing not far behind them, and understanding the Fate of their Companion, made all the Sail they could to <HI>Lymerick,</HI> for which the Wind very much favoured them, and we hear there are above Thirty Sail more, ready La∣den for <HI>France,</HI> whither they intended before now, had they not been prevented by Captain <HI>Cole</HI>'s Sqadron. On Board of these Ships, were most of the <HI>French</HI>-Officers; whom, as 'tis said, are resolved to leave the Kingdom, if possible they can get away, upon the Occasion of the great Heats and disagreements between Them, and the <HI>Irish</HI> Nobility and Offi∣cers at <HI>Lymerick.</HI></P>
