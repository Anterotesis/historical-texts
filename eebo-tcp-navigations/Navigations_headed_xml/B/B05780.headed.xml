<P>SCarce had they given over <HI>talking</HI> at Court of the taking of <HI>Mons,</HI> and of the advantages that <HI>France</HI> would re∣ceive by so important a Conquest, which put into her Hands the Key of all the Spanish <HI>Netherlands,</HI> but a whispering be∣gan to be spread abroad, that the Council had some new design in Hand, which promi∣sed great things and would be the occasion of as great an umbrage, yea greater than that of <HI>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> Whilst the Generals were ga∣thering together, and Monsieur <HI>de Luxem∣bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh, de Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, d' Humieres, Boufflers, Vauban</HI> and others of the secret Council were pas∣sing to and fro; it was not doubted but there was some grand Enterprize on foot. The Criticks of the times, and those which made it their business to foresee things to come, met also by courses, and did indiscreetly cast the Horoscope of the place threatned with this Thunderbolt, upon which it was ready to fall; making the Innocent bear the burthen of the Guilty, but withall not discovering any thing of their real intentions; for <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/> is so subtle in concealing her designs, that she would oblige People to believe quite ano∣ther thing than what she really intends. Nevertheless orders were given that all things should be in readiness. The Roads were al∣ready fill'd with Waggons and Carts loaden with Ammunition and Provision, which went to fill the Magazines of <HI>Mons, Phillip-Ville, Maubeuge,</HI> and <HI>Dinant.</HI> There were never seen so many Bombs and Carcasses, gathered together, and sent in a time when the rigour of the Winter had rendred the Roads unpassable. They were not satisfied with the great Stores of Corn and Forrage, that all the conquer'd Countries could furnish them withall, besides an innumerable number of Provisions, rais'd in the Enemies Country by way of Contributions, but also the Hay and Oats of <HI>Champaign</HI> and the Neighbouring Provinces, had been transported in so great abundance, that it reduc'd the People of that Country to the last extremity; having de∣prived them of their proper subsistance. Be∣sides all these Prodigious Preparations, to prevent yet the disorder which might hap∣pen to a great and numerous Army, if it should once come to want Provisions, they made use of the same Artifice as they had done at the Siege of <HI>Mons,</HI> I mean, that the Victu∣aller General found a way how to bring from
<PB N="3" REF="5"/> <HI>Holland</HI> 100000 Crowns worth of Dutch Cheese, by the intelligence he had with a Baker at <HI>Gaunt</HI> who knew the secret how to get it convey'd: In the affair of <HI>Mons,</HI> so great a provision was made, that after the reduction of that place, the Army being first furnish't, the rest was publickly sold, for fear it should be spoil'd; so that nothing was seen in the Boats and publick Markets but <HI>Holland</HI> Cheese.</P>
<P>So that we may say that <HI>France</HI> partly maintains her Armies, upon the subsistance of her Enemies; and the opportunity she hath by the means of her Gold and Silver, to spread Corruption in a Country as fruitful of Tray∣tors as <HI>Brabant,</HI> emboldens her, and makes her undertake in the midst of Winter, the Siege of the strongest places in <HI>Europe,</HI> whilst the Allies, who do not use so much precau∣tion, see themselves incapacitated for want of <HI>Magazines,</HI> to enter the Campaign before the Month of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>But it is not of Yesterday that <HI>France</HI> has been a practitioner in this mattter. In the War of 1672. she managed otherwise, for then Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> found the way, some Months before the Declaration of the War, to draw from the Principal Bankers of the City of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in ready Mony full eight Millions of Silver.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<P>This Summ and many others privately raised in several other Cities of these Pro∣vinces were advanced, and defray'd a part of the charge of the War, which had like to have overturn'd the State, and to put it upon the brink of ruin.</P>
<P>But without calling in the time past for our assistance, or diving into things acted in the precedent Wars and Ransacking, as we say, the Ashes of the Dead, let us dis∣course of the Living, and bring upon the Stage the Illustrious Marquess of <HI>Gastenaga,</HI> heretofore Governour of the low Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>What has he not done to fill his Coffers?</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Cavalry has lost in him one of the best Jockeys in all the Countries of <HI>Germany, Liege,</HI> or <HI>Brabant;</HI> and I do not know how they will do after the Campaign, and who shall furnish them sufficiently with Horses to remount their Cavalry. For we reckon that he has conveyed into <HI>France,</HI> since the Declaration of the War, to the num∣ber of 40000 Horse, for which he had three Pistoles <HI>per</HI> Horse for his pains.</P>
<P>But now when we unmask the cause of so many Misfortunes, must we not avow, whe∣ther we will or no, that we know the evil and are not willing to remedy it? since we see that no exact inquiry has been made into
<PB N="5" REF="6"/> all these rotten Members, who betray'd the good Party, and sold (by the example of <HI>Judas Iscariot</HI>) their Country, their Wives, and Children; and all that was most Sacred and Inviolable in the Government.</P>
<P>But to return to my matter in Hand: Af∣ter having so furnished the <HI>Magazines,</HI> as we have already said, Orders were dispatched, which were carried in all hast by Curriers sent into <HI>Savoy, Germany</HI> and <HI>Catalonia,</HI> to cause all the Troops to be upon their March, in order to be in <HI>Flanders</HI> at the be∣ginning of the Month of <HI>April.</HI> To cover yet better the great Design, and to deceive the Enemies by Marches &amp; Countermarches which were caus'd to be made, Monsieur <HI>Boufflers</HI> had orders to go to <HI>Mons</HI> to command in the absence of Monsieur <HI>Luxenburgh,</HI> who staid at <HI>Paris</HI> to assist at the last Resolutions of the great Council of War, which was to be held before the opening of the Campaign, where several obstacles and difficulties that Monsieur <HI>de Vauban</HI> and <HI>de Megrini</HI> had proposed in the Execution of this project were to be de∣cided. Now it is acknowledged by all, that these two Ingineers are beyond all contro∣versy not only the best of this Age, but al∣so that <HI>France</HI> ever had, since she was go∣vern'd by Kings, and that we may call them without <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> the Right Hand of the
<PB N="6" REF="7"/> Conquests that the King has made during the whole course of his Reign, and greatest prosperities, if we consider the Invention, the good Order, the Capacity, and the quick Execution; in which we may say that they have not their fellows in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But let us say also without <HI>Hyperbole</HI> or Flat∣tery, that it is a great advantage for an In∣genious Man, when he has to do with a Prince who spares nothing for the Execution of a design; and this doth not a little contribute to acquire him a great Reputation in the World; whereas others that are in the Ser∣vice of other Princes find themselves with all their Ingenuity, bauk'd and stopt, some∣times in the midst of their Carreer, when they are upon a great design, by the defect and want of means which should contribute the most to make them succeed.</P>
<P>But however it be, Monsieur <HI>de Vauban</HI> and <HI>de Megrini</HI> had orders to be at <HI>Versailles</HI> to assist at the finishing of this design. Monsieur <HI>de Megrini</HI> who made his ordinary abode at <HI>Tournay,</HI> of which he was Governour, depart∣ed in all haste to place himself, where his Majesties orders had call'd him, and arriv'd, almost at the same time as Monsieur <HI>Catinat</HI> did, who had taken Post immediately after the taking of <HI>Montmellian.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<P>All was now ready for the opening of the Council, and all the Generals his Majesty had pleas'd to call, were arriv'd.</P>
<P>The number yet was but very small, the King being in what regards his Council and his Secrets, a Prince as circumspect as ever was; which is the cause that his Ma∣jesty confides in so few persons, and that he ordinarily admits none but such as are ex∣tremely reserv'd; so we we may say it is one of the principal Wheels upon which his great designs, and his good fortune moves; and that he is come to so many Conquests on∣ly by this means; and if we say of Mony that it is the Sinew of War, we may say also that Silence is the Soul, and that by conse∣quence they are both indispensably and ab∣solutely necessary, since they make Armies move and march where they think fit, mak∣ing them Victorious and Masters of the most Important Forts, of Provinces, and also of whole Kingdoms, as we have experienc'd in the last Revolution that happen'd in <HI>England,</HI> which we may say was the only time that the French King was deceiv'd; for that ordina∣rily he has so many precautions, and also so great a number of <HI>Emissaries</HI> well paid in all Courts, that he keeps in his Pocket (so to speak) the Key of their Counsels and most secret Resolutions.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<P>But we may say that the affair of <HI>England</HI> was miraculous; for how else could King <HI>William,</HI> encompass'd round with French Spies, as he was in such a place as the <HI>Hague,</HI> (where they were seen to walk openly in Troops, and with as much confidence and fierceness as if they had been in the midst of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Paris</HI>) find nevertheless means to hide so great an undertaking, to carry it on a whole year, and to trust but two Ministers of State with it, to wit Pensionary <HI>Fagel</HI> of happy memory, and Monsieur <HI>Dickvelt,</HI> to make all the Preparations, and at last to make them appear by the Reduction of three Kingdoms, and to save, by an undertaking as bold as successfull, <HI>Europe</HI> from Slavery, and that in the sight of two mighty Kings his Enemies well Arm'd, who stood waiting for him without ever stirring, treated him with fool-hardiness, and flatter'd themselves with hopes, to see him swallow'd up in his enter∣prize, with as much shame and Confusion as the unfortunate Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was?</P>
<P>Finally, that I may return to my subject, the great Council of War, which was to be held at <HI>Versailles,</HI> being assembled, and all the Generals being there present, his Majesty would according to his custom have a particular Conference with each General, and for this reason order'd they should enter
<PB N="9" REF="8"/> in order, one after another, into his Cham∣ber.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> was first call'd, as be∣ing the greatest Favourite, and him in whom his Majesty most confided, looking upon him as his greatest support, and him who would maintain at present the Honour of the Nati∣on and the Glory of <HI>France.</HI> It will not be alltogether foreign to our purpose, before we go any farther, to speak a word of the Person of this General.</P>
<P>We will say then that Monsieur <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> so much made of and so much esteem'd as now he is, ought not to boast to be descended from the Illustrious and ancient House of <HI>Luxem∣burgh,</HI> which has given so many Emperors to <HI>Germany,</HI> and so many Kings to <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Bohemia;</HI> neither is he of the posterity of those titular Dukes of <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> and <HI>Piney,</HI> Princes of <HI>Tingry;</HI> but a Posthumous Son of <HI>Francis Lord</HI> of <HI>Bouteville,</HI> of the House of <HI>Montmoranci,</HI> who was beheaded at <HI>Paris</HI> the 21. of <HI>June,</HI> 1627. for having kill'd in cold Blood in a Duel several persons of Quality. This happen'd under the Mi∣nistry of the Cardinal <HI>Richelieu.</HI> The pre∣sent Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> was then but in the Cradle, and the Countess of <HI>Bouteville</HI> his Mother, retir'd her self after this disgrace to one of her Country Houses, where she
<PB N="10" REF="9"/> liv'd a Melancholy life, till such time as her only Son, whom she very tenderly belov'd, arriv'd at the seventh year of his age, an age in which it was fit to take him from the Hands of Women, and put him under the care of Governors capable to give him Edu∣cation suitable for a Person of Quality.</P>
<P>By this time Madam <HI>de Bouteville</HI> judg'd that the Mothers House was a place very un∣fit for the Education of the young Count, and besides, being not dissatisfied to find an occasion to shew a part of her Resentment of the shameful Death of her Husband, she resolv'd to carry her Son to Court, and present him to the King.</P>
<P>She set out then for <HI>Paris</HI> without much Equipage, and being arriv'd she went the next day to St. <HI>Germain,</HI> and demanded Au∣dience of the King, who was then with the Prince and some Lords of the Court. They were mightily surpriz'd at the arrival of this Lady, who for many years, had not appear'd in the World, and every one strove to find out the reason of it, when she enter'd into the Chamber, having her Son in her Hand, whom she carried straight to the King, say∣ing, Sir, here is the last of the <HI>Montmoranci</HI>'s, which I present to your Majestty to do with as you think fit.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
<P>The King would have reply'd something to her, but Madam <HI>de Bouteville</HI> not desiring to engage in any further discourse, retir'd after having perform'd her obeisance and left the young Count in the Kings Chamber.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> who was naturally very generous, was so affected at the condi∣tion of this poor Gentleman, that he told the King, that he having been formerly a ve∣ry good friend of his Fathers, and of Mon∣sieur <HI>de Montmoranci,</HI> he would do him a very great favour to let him bring up this last cast∣away of a Family which had been dear to him; the King consented, and the Prince carried him home, caus'd him to be instruct∣ed and brought up with all imaginable care, particularly in the exercises of a Gentleman, su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h as Riding the Great Horse, and Fencing, and as to that, give me leave to tell you what an old Officer brought up from his infancy in the Lord <HI>Bouteville's</HI> House, did assure me, that Monsieur <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> was born straight, and of a good shape, and that he appear'd so to the Eyes of the World, till he was ten years of age, that the Prince, as we may say, forcing nature in the Child, did so harass him in mounting on Horse back and fencing, before he was strong enough to bear these rude Exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ises, that he thereby lost one full Third of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
<P>In effect, those that have seen him undress'd know that he is in a manner all Thighs and Leggs,</P>
<P>Nevertheless, this last opinion is scarcely believ'd, if we make Reflection upon his hump back, which gives him so ridiculous an Air, and which cannot be look'd upon other∣wise than a natural defect; and it is reaso∣nable to believe he came into the World in this condition, because we certainly see by experience, that the exercise of Arms contri∣butes rather to regulate and render the Body free, than to cause such imperfections.</P>
<P>Let it be as it will, he has improv'd it well. We may say that he is at present a Man after the King's own Heart, so it is not to be wonder'd at if he leaves to him the Government of his Armies, since he has been bold several times to say, <HI>That he thank'd God that he had caus'd him to be born with∣out pity and compassion, to the end he might be more capable of serving the King his Master, and executing his designs:</HI> A ve∣ry Christian like sentiment and worthy of Monsieur <HI>de Luxemburgh.</HI></P>
<P>But as to the Hump in his Back, it will not be amiss to give an account of a thought which he had the day after the Battle of <HI>Fleurns.</HI></P>
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
<P>As he receiv'd the Complements of success from the Lieutenant Generals, and other Officers of his Army, shewing them his Hump, he told them he had there a reserve of a Body of Forty Thousand Men, of which his Enemies knew nothing, which would always render him Victorious, thereby re∣marking the Artifices which he made use of, which without contradiction makes up a good part of the Necromancy, of which he was accused, and which he himself has be∣gun to Communicate, since he has been a Commander, to the other French Generals.</P>
<P>The Marquess <HI>de Bouflers,</HI> who was one of his principal Disciples, did him most Honour; for he it is that at present seems to have profited most by the Lessons of his Master.</P>
<P>So Monsieur <HI>de Luxemburgh</HI> chose him to be at the Head of this reserve, of which he spoke, and was very careful in all the Battles, to place him so well, that he was seen running up and down like a Mad-Man, not to say fly, upon the least signal that he gave him.</P>
<P>The King seeing him come in, turn'd towards him, and spoke in these Terms, <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> you are the Person at this Day in whom <HI>France</HI> places her greatest hopes; my People look upon
<PB N="14" REF="11"/> you as their <HI>Turenne,</HI> and I my self esteem you as my right Hand; you see me en∣gaged in an unhappy War, which con∣sumes my Treasure, impoverishes my Sub∣jects, ruins the State, and makes me apprehensive of unhappy Events.</P>
<P>It is a lingring Fever, which undermines by little and little my Kingdom, and I fear lest it should in the issue become like <HI>Spain,</HI> that is to say, a poor and impotent Desert.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> I thank your Majesty for having forgot my pass'd faults, and for honouring me with the preference of the Command of your Armies before the Marshal <HI>d' Humieres,</HI> much Older and Wiser than my self.</P>
<P>I am at the same time very much Obliged to the deceased Marquess of <HI>Louvois</HI> my good Friend, and to the good Madam <HI>de Main∣tenon,</HI> who sollicited my release, and em∣ploy'd all their credit with your Majesty to get me out of the <HI>Bastile,</HI> where I had been shut up, upon the Death of the Count <HI>de Soissons,</HI> and several other small mat∣ters, which I was branded withall: I vow, I did not expect to be received again into your Grace and Favour, your Majesty ha∣ving had since t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e War of 1672 a particu∣lar aversion to my P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rson.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>
<P>But on the other side, I am glad to see that my Enemies have for their part shame and trouble by the Triumph of my Innocence, after having imploy'd all their power to ruin me. I shall remember all my Life time the reverend Father <HI>La Chaise,</HI> and the jealous Madam <HI>de Montes∣pan,</HI> who have been the principal actors of this Tragedy, and if it is natural to keep resentment, I will reserve to my self a favourable occasion to let them know that I have not been either a Necroman∣cer, nor Madam <HI>Brinvilliers</HI> Disciple.</P>
<P>But, answer'd his Majesty, Let us not talk of pass'd Quarrels; altho' what is said of you should be true, and also that you had a familiar Spirit to win Battles, to gain the Love of the Ladies, and to please me, I will in acknowledgment of the Ser∣vices that you have done me in the Wars of <HI>Holland,</HI> and that you may do me in the present War, order the Courts of Ju∣stice to burn the Informations and the Tryal, and to forbid any upon pain of Death throughout my whole Kingdom to talk directly or indirectly of it.</P>
<P>Sir, answered <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> I most hum∣bly thank your Majesty for the care that you will take of my reputation, and I do engage upon my word, that in remem∣brance
<PB N="16" REF="12"/> of so great a Favour, I will do for my part, all that lies in my power, to ruin your Enemies, and advance your Conquests.</P>
<P>You know, answer'd his Majesty, That the first Campaign, which was that of 1689. I gave the Command of my Army to the Marshal <HI>d' Humieres,</HI> and that this Gene∣ral, who is a good Man, did really do me good service.</P>
<P>For it was him that I sent Ambassador to the Court of <HI>England,</HI> immediately af∣ter the Death of King <HI>Charles,</HI> and he ex∣ecuted my Orders very punctually. For King <HI>James,</HI> who came to be Crown'd King of three Kingdoms, received him with open Arms, and very generously accepted all the offers of Alliance and Friendship that <HI>Humieres</HI> made him on my be∣half.</P>
<P>But this unfortunate Prince afterwards not having followed my Orders, found himself all of a sudden overwhelm'd with great troubles, and has engag'd me in a War which has Arm'd all <HI>Europe</HI> against me.</P>
<P>But to come to my purpose: Having then chose him to Command in <HI>Flanders</HI> against Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> a General of good Conduct, and well instructed in
<PB N="17" REF="12"/> what concern'd the Order that an Army in her Marches and Incampments ought to be kept in; but on the other hand ve∣ry unlucky to hazard a Battle; I remark'd that in this first year, the Marshal <HI>d' Hu∣mieres</HI> suffer'd himself to be Coop'd up, as we say, by Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> and that he had during the whole Campaign the dis∣advantage.</P>
<P>I remember also very well the Battle of <HI>Walcourt,</HI> which was on the Great St. <HI>Louis</HI> day, Patron and Protector of my King∣dom, where all my House-hold was Cut in pieces; but I pardon him with all my heart, because he did it with a good in∣tention, and belief of doing me Service that day. The little Genius of <HI>d' Humi∣eres</HI> was not only the cause of this check; but we may also say that he favour'd, by the little motion he made, the Enterpri∣zes of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and of the Ele∣ctors, who took Three good Cities from me that year.</P>
<P>The deceased Marquess <HI>de Louvois,</HI> whom I now very much lament, foretold it me; the good Man was a very good Physiognomist, and as he knew his People extremely well, so he was observed not to be mistaken in the choice he made of Persons of merit to fill the vacant places, which has been the
<PB N="18" REF="13"/> cause, that during my Reign, I have always had the choicest Persons.</P>
<P>It was he that presented Monsieur <HI>Ca∣tinat</HI> to me, to Command in <HI>Italy,</HI> being a Man, he said, who had experience, and the good Fortune to have pass'd through all the inferiour degrees in the War, having been formerly a common Sol∣dier.</P>
<P>I was also willing to imploy the Duke of <HI>Duras</HI> to Command in <HI>Germany;</HI> but <HI>Louvois</HI> advis'd me rather to send the Mar∣shal <HI>de Lorge</HI> his Brother, as a Man who had more of Softness and execution, which agrees better with the natural slowness of the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>I had also made choice of Monsieur <HI>Lau∣zun</HI> for <HI>Ireland,</HI> at the Sollicitation of Ma∣damoiselle <HI>de Monpensier</HI> my Cousin, but the poor Man is no more what he was, and the affairs of that Kingdom were quite changed after the loss of the Battle of the <HI>Boyn,</HI> where he commanded joyntly with King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Louvois</HI> advis'd me to call him back as soon as possibly, and to send the brave St. <HI>Ruth</HI> of happy memory, whom I much lament, because he was the Man that Purg'd my Kingdom of the Huguenot He∣resie.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="13"/>
<P>He was naturally hasty, but brave as his Sword.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, I found him very servicea∣ble to me, and if he had not been unfortuna∣tely kill'd by a Cannon Bullet, I am persua∣ded that the War would have lasted still in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> would not have come off so cheap in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>It is also the deceased Marquis of <HI>Louvois</HI> who presented <HI>Tourville</HI> to me to Com∣mand my Fleet, as an Admiral of a gallant Person; And I vow that I have had till this very time a great deal of trouble to stop the Torrent of his Courage. He talks to me in all my undertakings of nothing but giv∣ing Battle to the Enemy. Hitherto I have always hindred him, because I was not altogether satisfied with the Engagement of 1690. where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> alone with 20. or 22. Men of War, dar'd to attack him at the head of my Fleet, which was composed of more than 80. great Ships, whilst the <HI>English</HI> contented themselves to be Spectators; and that which caused astonishment, was, that after a Fight of more than Six hours, not one of the Ene∣mies Ships was taken, having retreated after the Fight in very good order, tho' in truth disabled and unmasted. So the last Expedition, I order'd him to shun all
<PB N="20" REF="14"/> Engageing, and when the Enemies should be on the one side, to go on the other; which he observ'd very well</P>
<P>'Tis also from the same hand that the Marquiss <HI>de Bouflers</HI> was presented to me, tho' in truth Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> also contributed, for she wearied me Night and Day, and I never saw her but she spoke to me of him.</P>
<P>But I have not been deceiv'd in him.</P>
<P>He is one of the bravest Officers that I have at this Day in my Armies, and from whom I reap the greatest benefit, by the Contributions, which he takes care to ga∣ther together, and to make my Enemies pay in ready mony, which makes a consi∣derable Sum, design'd to buy Horses to re-mount my Cavalry.</P>
<P>For his pains, I have lately made him Captain of my Guards, besides several other good Offices which he possesses; fur∣ther more I have reserv'd a Marshals Staff for him, if the War last two Campaigns more.</P>
<P>'Tis <HI>Louvois</HI> also who presented to me Monsieur <HI>Amelott</HI> (formerly my Ambassa∣dor at <HI>Venice</HI>) to go and reside with the Laudable <HI>Swiss Cantons</HI> during this War.</P>
<P>I have been deceiv'd in him no more than in Monsieur <HI>Bouflers,</HI> for if this knows
<PB N="21" REF="14"/> how to use a Pistol, and is able in the handling of a Sword, the other is no less in that of the Pen. It is also to his good conduct that I attribute all the good intel∣ligence, which reigns at present amongst my Cousins the <HI>Suissers.</HI></P>
<P>Let him but make a Speech with Words well plac'd, back'd with a good Purse of my <HI>Louisses,</HI> distributed under∣hand and behind the Curtain, I obtain im∣mediately all I would have. They grant∣ed me the last Campaign the raising of ten thousand Men of new Troops.</P>
<P>I hope they will grant me this Cam∣paign at least fifteen thousand to fill up the number of the forty thousand that I have in my service, with whom I am very well satisfied, for they are the best Foot of my Army.</P>
<P>I ought not to forget to speak one word by the way of their General <HI>Stouppa,</HI> with whom I am very well contented, who seems to have chang'd his Country in changing his Religion, that is to say, be∣come a good French-Man. He takes so strongly to Heart my interests, that we see him boldly march at the Head of the <HI>Swisser</HI>'s Troops, every where, and in all places, laughing at certain old and pre∣tended Treaties, which say that the <HI>Swissers</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="15"/> that are in my Service, shall not act a∣gainst the Emperour and his Allies. 'Tis <HI>Louvois</HI> also who presented to me the Count of <HI>Bethune</HI> that I lately sent to the King of <HI>Sweedland</HI> to feel the pulse of that Prince, and to see if there was no way to engage him to a Rupture.</P>
<P><HI>Bidall</HI> writ to me that he could no lon∣ger retain his Resentment, and that the English and Dutch Capers might make him become one <HI>of the French Interest.</HI> I have given order to the Count <HI>de Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hune</HI> to say at his arrival at <HI>Stockholme,</HI> That he was arriv'd by chance, and that a Tem∣pest had cast him there, that he may con∣ceal so much the better his Negotiation. I hear, thanks to God, that he is happi∣ly arriv'd. I have also in <HI>Holland</HI> one of the Disciples of <HI>Bethune,</HI> which doth me very good service, and who has well suc∣ceeded the Count <HI>d' Avaux.</HI></P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Bethune</HI> had considerable Summs to pay to Madam <HI>Morean's</HI> Father a rich Merchant at <HI>Paris,</HI> but finding him∣self disabl'd to serve him, he engag'd him∣self to obtain of the King of <HI>Poland</HI> (by my recommendation) Letters of credit for Monsieur <HI>Moreau</HI> her Husband, and that by this means he might, as we say, kill two Birds with one Stone, and be as
<PB N="23" REF="15"/> <HI>Janus</HI> with two Faces, in calling himself Envoy of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and keep∣ing in effect the place of the Count <HI>d' Avaux</HI> in his absence. I am very well satisfied with him, and I esteem him as one of my best Correspondents in <HI>Hol∣land.</HI></P>
<P>When the Count <HI>de Bethune</HI> shall have made the first motion to the Northern Princes, I have then the Count <HI>d' Avaux,</HI> and <HI>Bonrepos,</HI> ready to set sail for that Coast, to go and finish what <HI>Bethune</HI> shall have begun.</P>
<P>I have made choice of these two Mi∣nisters <HI>d' Avaux</HI> for <HI>Sweedland,</HI> and <HI>Bon∣repos</HI> for <HI>Denmark,</HI> because truly I judg them most proper to bring those two Crowns to a Mediation; their manage∣ment accompanied with some Millions may buy a peace, or at least set a good step towards it. <HI>D' Avaux</HI> has done me great Services in <HI>Holland,</HI> and knows the Republican Spirit to the bottom. St. <HI>Didier</HI> his Secretary, and whom I call his <HI>Achates,</HI> has orders to follow him, because he understands admirably well to draw up a Memorial proper to persuade, and bring them into a Snare.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sieur de Rebenack</HI> was also present∣ed to me by Monsieur <HI>Louvois,</HI> and nei∣ther

<PB N="23" REF="16"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="24" REF="17"/> have I forgot what he told me in re∣commending him to me.</P>
<P>Sir, said he, here is the most active of your Subjects, and from whom your Ma∣jesty may receive great Services, if you send him Ambassadour to the Northern Crowns; which I did accordingly, and truly he did me very good service at the Court of the deceased Elector of <HI>Brande∣burgh.</HI></P>
<P>I knew by his Intreagues all that pass'd there. The Kings of <HI>Sweedland</HI> and <HI>Den∣mark</HI> did nothing but what I came to the knowledg of, by his means; so that I did not trouble my self to have on that side any other Spy, nor correspondence but his. Since calling him home, I sent <HI>Bidal</HI> in his place, and it is he also actually takes care of my intelligence in those Countries.</P>
<P>But answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> I have heard that your Majesty has sent <HI>Rebenack</HI> lately into <HI>Italy,</HI> to endeavour to bring the Princes of those parts to imbrace your side, or at least a good Neutrality. It is true, said his Majesty, and (I wish) he may cross the designs of the <HI>Germans,</HI> and persuade the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> not to grant them Winter Quarters.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="17"/>
<P>He has orders to go to all those Courts, by what I can understand his Negotiation will not be altogether in vain, having al∣ready put many of those Princes into a wavering condition. The great Duke of <HI>Tuscany</HI> and the Republick of <HI>Genoua</HI> have promis'd him, and I hope the rest will follow.</P>
<P>Sir, reply'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> must he not al∣so take a turn to <HI>Rome</HI> to kiss the Slipper of Innocent the 12th. on the behalf of your Majesty? for by what I can learn that good Father has more of a French Heart than <HI>Alexander</HI> the 8th. and <HI>Innocent</HI> the 11th. his Predecessors. Without doubt, answer'd his Majesty, for the Holy Father granted me al∣most all I ask'd of him, whereas the others refus'd me every thing. He has already granted the greatest part of the necessary Bulls, to the Bishops of my Kingdom, and promis'd to the Count <HI>d' Estree</HI> to endeavour with all forwardness to procure a peace to Christendom.</P>
<P>Now I think on't Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> how does your Majesty like the Baron <HI>de Chateauneuf,</HI> whom I took the liberty to present to be your Ambassadour at <HI>Constan∣tinople?</HI></P>
<P>Very well, says his majesty, he is a gown Man, &amp; come out of my Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="18"/> where he pass'd for an able Man in busi∣ness; and I wanted such a Man as him; for by what I can learn he is an artist in persuading the Grand Signior. Besides, the best of it is that he is very well be∣lov'd by the Grand Visir, who has pro∣mis'd him to hearken to no peace this Campaign, but even that, not without two hundred thousand Crowns which he was oblig'd to pay him.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> Mony at this Day affords great help to your Ma∣jesty; and if it should come once to fail I do not know how all would go. That puts me in mind of what the History of our Kings report of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, who was Sirnam'd the Wise that he without going out of his Closet, had always the ad∣vantage over the English, and obtain'd all his designs.</P>
<P>After his Death he was called rich, be∣cause at his Death he left 17 Millions of Crowns, which was a prodigious Sum at that time. I much doubt if your Ma∣jesty had reign'd in that time, whether you would have succeeded in all your En∣terprises with so small a Sum; since we see that you have a great deal of trouble to do it with the three hundred Millions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Livers that you draw from your Sub∣jects.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="18"/>
<P><HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> says his Mayjesty, a Prince which is absolute over his People, and who is by consequence Master of their Estates, has Mines of Gold and Silver which never consume; these Springs ne∣ver dry up, and are infinitely richer and more abounding than those of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru;</HI> and we see in our Days that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> that furnishes (as we may say) all other Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> with all the Riches they have, and all the Gold and Silver which rules in the trade of each People and each Nation, is nevertheless the least partaker of it, and has the most occasion for it.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> if your predecessours <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth and <HI>Louis</HI> the Thirteenth had had the Despotick and Arbitrary Power, as your Majesty has at this Day, especially <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, who was a stirring Prince and full of acti∣vity; what could they not have done?</P>
<P>The true art to reign, says his Ma∣jesty, was unknown to them, and they knew not how to make any profit of the lessons of <HI>Machiavel,</HI> and of the incom∣parable <HI>Richelieu</HI> and <HI>Mazarine,</HI> who have been the only persons that have taught it; so that I do not see of all my Ancestors why <HI>Louis</HI> the Eleventh should make so
<PB N="28" REF="19"/> much use of that Principle which was attributed to him, and which has been since call'd the Maxim of <HI>Louis</HI> the Ele∣venth, <HI>qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare.</HI></P>
<P>He that knows not how to dissemble, knows not how to Reign.</P>
<P>As to the matter of Mony, says <HI>Luxem∣burgh,</HI> how does your Majesty like <HI>Pont-Chartrain,</HI> that the deceased Monsieur <HI>Col∣bert</HI> recommended to you before his Death, as a Man very proper to manage your Treasury?</P>
<P><HI>Pontchartrain,</HI> answer'd his Majesty, doth me good service in the present conjun∣cture, and I know not how all would go if I had him not. When I find my self short of Mony, which often happens by reason of the pressing necessities of the War, I need only say to him, I have oc∣casion for so many Millions; as he is ex∣treamly ingenious and one of the best Partizans that has ever been in <HI>France,</HI> he immediately invents some new Impost upon the People, or some new Tax upon those which are po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of places.</P>
<P>Nor is this all, for he is expert to find out means, how to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e it presently in ready Mony.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgh,</HI> I believe your Majesty very much laments th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s you
<PB N="29" REF="19"/> had by the deceased Mr. <HI>Colbert,</HI> which was an understanding Man, if ever there was any in the management of your Trea∣sury.</P>
<P>He was too much hated by the People, says his Majesty; they began to call him Thief, they accus'd him of having ruin'd <HI>France,</HI> and made it a general Hospital; and yet he never did any thing but by my order, and acquainting me with all he did. Let it be as it will, he has been the Instrument of a great many things, of which I should never have thought of, had not he perswaded me unto them.</P>
<P>In short, for the quieting of my People, I am glad that his death has taken this Obstacle out of their way that was a hor∣rour to them; and as we love Novelties, we always flatter our selves, that the last comer will be better than the former; all the World conceiv'd great hopes upon the Arrival of <HI>Pontchartrain.</HI></P>
<P>But says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> I think that <HI>Colbert</HI> had gather'd together great Riches, which he possess'd as his own, and all his Children became very great.</P>
<P>It is true, says his Majesty, but after his Death the Water came to it's Spring, and I caus'd full and good Restitution to be made: I made use of a specious pre∣tence
<PB N="30" REF="20"/> to drain them, which brought some Millions into my Coffers.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> let us let all those matters alone which do not concern the War; your Majesty has no time to lose, the matter in hand is now to pre∣vent your Enemies, and be early in the Field, so that it's time to take a firm and so∣lid resolution.</P>
<P><HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> you have reason, says his Majesty, and it is also for that purpose I caus'd you to come hither, together with my other Generals, to hear you one after ano∣ther, and to have a private conference about what I ought to undertake.</P>
<P>But as you are one of those in whom I have most confidence; and that on the other side my design is to make <HI>Flanders</HI> the principal Theatre of the War, where I pretend that my great designs shall ap∣pear, I will impart every thing to you with an open heart. You are a Man of experience, and the Wars of Seventy Two has given you a particular know∣ledg of that Country. I lament extream∣ly the poor Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> he also knew perfectly the Genius and Interests of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Schombergh</HI> would have also been of great use to me if his infatuation to Religion
<PB N="31" REF="20"/> had not made him perish miserably in <HI>Ire∣land.</HI> Poor <HI>Turenne,</HI> the Flower of all my Generals, <HI>hac Coelum itur via,</HI> merited the same Honours, that the Gods formerly gave to great <HI>Hercules</HI> in memory of his Toils, I mean Immortality.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, I shall never forget the good service he did me in <HI>Germany,</HI> and of so many brave Captains, you are the on∣ly one that is left me; so I desire you not to expose your self too much, and to take as much care of your dear Person as my Armies. For if I should come to lose you, I should not know who to give the Command to, having for the most part none but Lieutenant Generals, more fit to Command a party of Incendiaries, than an Army so considerable as that in <HI>Flan∣ders.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> coming every Campaign to Command himself, would desire no better than to have to do with a Novice; nor the fiery Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who also commands with him.</P>
<P>These two Princes fly round about my Army as a Bird of Prey about a Swallow, and seek nothing else, but to make me lose a Battle to make way for them into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> here is now a trick
<PB N="32" REF="21"/> of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> which puts me in despair. He is not contented to mount the Throne of <HI>England</HI> after poor King <HI>James</HI> his Father-in-Law, and my Ally, was retired to my Court; but he does yet worse in respect to me, for he has found out a means to drive me out of the Low-Countries, endeavouring to deprive the <HI>Dauphin</HI> my Son of the Provinces fallen to his Mother my Wife the most Christian Queen, by the decease of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> her Mother, of Prince <HI>Don Balthazar</HI> her Brother, and of the Catholick King <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, her Father. The Stratagem that he has made use of is, he has brought the King of <HI>Spain, Charles</HI> the Second, to make a gift <HI>ad vitam</HI> of the Spanish <HI>Ne∣therlands</HI> to the Elector of <HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P>They made a shew some years ago to have play'd this trick; but I made such strong Protestations, and threatnings to come into <HI>Flanders</HI> with a great Army, without having any regard to the Truce, that they thought fit for the Peace of those Provinces, and the repose of <HI>Europe</HI> to re∣fer the matter to another time.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> all this good success we owe to the taking of <HI>Mons,</HI> and the good Correspondence that the good Marquis <HI>de Gastanaga</HI> had kept with us,
<PB N="33" REF="21"/> which was thereby discover'd.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> seeing the Spanish <HI>Netherlands</HI> were sold at a great price by the covetousness of the Governours, resolv'd to play a Masterpiece in causing it to be put into better hands, who would make it their glory to preserve it.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, can that be done without injustice, and can they dispute with my Son the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> as they would have disputed with me in the time of the Wars of <HI>Paris,</HI> that the most Christian Queen <HI>Maria Tieresia,</HI> formerly Infanta of <HI>Spai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and immediaely after the <HI>Pirenaean</HI> Peace became my Wife, was brought to Bed of a Prince at <HI>Fountain Bleau,</HI> on All <HI>Saints</HI> day, the first of <HI>November,</HI> a little before Noon in the year 1661.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> the <HI>Dau∣phins</HI> Birth is not the thing in Question; no Body doubts but he is truly your Ma∣jesties and the Queen <HI>Maria Tieresia's</HI> Son. We are well satisfied with the fruitfulness of that Princess.</P>
<P>And as to what properly concerns your Majesties Person, you have, thanks to God, furnish'd us with Patterns, taken from the Originals of the Lad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>de Fontanges, la Val∣liere,</HI> and <HI>la Mourtespan,</HI> who have l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft enough of Illustrious young <HI>Sprigs,</HI> Wit∣ness
<PB N="34" REF="22"/> the Duke <HI>de Main,</HI> Madam the Prin∣cess of <HI>Conti,</HI> and <HI>Madamoiselle de Blois</HI> now Dutchess of <HI>Charters.</HI> As for Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> who succeeded them, I dare not speak of, because I am perswaded it is a Soil where the best Seeds-men seem to me to loose their time and trouble, unless God would make her a <HI>Sarah.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Madamoiselle de Blois,</HI> I must tell your Majesty by the way, that they talk very much of her Marriage with Monsieur the Duke <HI>de Charters,</HI> in Foreign Coun∣tries, and Principally in <HI>Holland,</HI> where they Criticize even upon the least Actions of Kings and Princes.</P>
<P>All the World take upon them here to talk of Politicks, nay even the Wo∣men.</P>
<P>They say that your Majesty has by this Marriage, and by that of the Princess <HI>de Conti,</HI> unworthily and without distinction, mixt the pure with the impure, and that if this should continue, there would not remain in <HI>France</HI> one drop of the Noble Blood of your Great Grandfathers, and that we should see no other in the Royal Family, but the Children of <HI>la Valliere,</HI> and <HI>la Montespan.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to my matter in Hand, that which is the Question is, that the Allies
<PB N="35" REF="22"/> pretend the renunciation your Majesty made at the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Peace has forfeited you your Right and Pretensions, which you might have had to the Succession we were speaking of.</P>
<P>But, says his Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty, it was not in my power to dispose of those Rights, and to renounce them to the prejudice of my Son; according to all Laws, the Fathers have no right to alienate the Estates of their Chil∣dren whilst they are Minors, and when these Estates are Maternal.</P>
<P>But, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> the Marriage was only concluded upon this condition; so that the renunciation your Majesty made upon all the present and future Right that you might have upon <HI>Spain,</HI> or upon the depending States, was consider'd as the Ground of Marriage, without which the Ministers of <HI>Spain</HI> would have been guilty of a great deal of Folly on their side, to have consented to an Ally∣ance which would have produc'd n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w causes of Wars and Divisions, instead of a Firm and Stable Peace, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h was their chief design.</P>
<P>I add to all these proofs, that the Cir∣cumstance of the Oath that your Majesty was obliged to take in swearing solemnly upon the Holy Evangelists, that you
<PB N="36" REF="23"/> would keep your Royal World that you then gave, was as the Seal of all the pro∣mises, of the engagements, and of the good Faith of your Majesty.</P>
<P>In your opinion, says the King, I am then very ill grounded in my pretensions, and I have no right according to the Civil Law.</P>
<P>No, without doubt, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> but a hundred thousand Men, a hundred pieces of Cannon, and a hundred Mil∣lions will make the Ballance incline much more to your side.</P>
<P>It was a custom to represent Justice blindfolded, holding a Balance in one Hand; but if the other had not been arm'd with a Sword, and had a Lion plac'd by her side, which is the badge of Force and Might, she would have been but a ridiculous Maygame, expos'd to the violence and rashness of Men. So we may say, he that has the power in his Hand is the Master of Justice, and whether she will or no, must of necessity betake her self to his side, and fight under his Standards against the weakest, and this is your Ma∣jesty's Right. But, says his Majesty, since things are in this condition, and that I see my self Master of Force and of Justice, shall I not do well to push my good fortune to the end, and to render my self, by my
<PB N="37" REF="23"/> Armies always victorious and triumphant over all the States which shall be at my discretion and serve for my conveni∣ence, having placed my self safe from the opposition of mine Enemies? Very well, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> there is no other obsta∣cle which is capable to stop your Majesty but the Faith of Treaties. But that is another Gospel for your Majesty for which you care but very little. We say of King <HI>John</HI> the First, one of your An∣cestors descended from the first Branch of <HI>Valois,</HI> that that Prince was so great an observer of his Word, that they gave him the Title of Good. He was accustomed to say, that when Fidelity and good Faith should be banished the World, they ought to be found in the person of a Prince.</P>
<P>This Prince, answer'd his Majesty, did not know <HI>Machiavel;</HI> and you should have added at the same time that he was very unhappy during his Reign; and I do not doubt but his too great Goodness was in part the cause of his Misfortunes.</P>
<P>For having lost the Battle of <HI>Poictiers</HI> against the English, who were commanded by the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> a great Captain, the King was taken and carried Prisoner to <HI>London,</HI> from whence he came not out, but by the treaty of <HI>Bretigny,</HI> by which
<PB N="38" REF="24"/> he quitted the Sovereignty of some Pro∣vinces in <HI>France</HI> in f vour of the King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But all these faults of <HI>John</HI> the First were gloriously repaired by <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth his Successor, who acquir'd to him self the name of Wife.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> since your Majesty Laughs so at the good Faith of Treaties, which other Princes look upon as Inviolable and adore as an Idol, I am not surpriz'd that you have heap'd up Con∣quest upon Conquest.</P>
<P>There is never a little Prince in the World but may be in a condition to make himself great by this means, and at last become the terror of his Enemies; but it is not to be wished that such a like disor∣der should happen, for if every Soveraign should do the like, we should see a great number of Scepters overthrown to the ground become the Prey of the strongest.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, since it is not per∣mitted to make ones self great, what's the reason that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is Mounted even in our Days upon the Throne of his Father-in-Law? Is not that an Usurpation?</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> that is not sin∣gular, Histories are full of such like instan∣ces
<PB N="39" REF="24"/> and we see that <HI>Childerick</HI> the Third, last King of the first Race was Dethron'd by <HI>Pepin</HI> the Short, who before was but Mayor of the Palace, which was a place almost like that of Grand <HI>Visirs;</HI> and his deposing was also done by the Assembly of the States, after the <HI>Pope</HI> had declar'd that the <HI>French</HI> were dispens'd with from owning that Prince.</P>
<P>So that the poor Dethroned <HI>Childerick</HI> had no other part to take, but to shave himself, and put himself into a Monastery. And as this disgrace happen'd to him by reasons of State, which would be too long to report, so the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is not mounted upon the Throne but by the con∣sent of the People which call'd him to it. And the Parliament it self which being in <HI>England</HI> very near to what the States were formerly in <HI>France,</HI> Crown'd him and confirm'd him; <HI>nemine contradicente;</HI> so the coming of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to the Crown ought to be call'd an <HI>Acceptance</HI> and not an <HI>Ʋsurpation.</HI></P>
<P>According to this sense, says his M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣jesty, you are then of opinion that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is well grounded, and that the poor King <HI>James</HI> has no shorter Course to take in the midst of his disgraces than to imitate <HI>Childeric;</HI> that is to say, to make a
<PB N="40" REF="25"/> rennuciation of the Crown, shave him∣self and so put himself into a Convent.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> I abuse, per∣haps, the liberty your Majesty allows me, speaking open hearted my Mind, and what I think of the misfortune of this Prince. But as in the beginning of this Conference your Majesty was pleased to say you put a great deal of Confidence in me, I de∣sire you also to give me leave to abstain from the language of certain Parasites who applaud your Majesty in every thing.</P>
<P>No, <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> says his Majesty, you do me a kindness to tell me the things as you think t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em; that does not surprise me, because I have always given you more liberty to speak your thoughts than any of my Courtiers and Counsel∣lors.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> since your Ma∣jesty gives me leave to speak what I think of King <HI>James</HI> and of the War which has been kindled in <HI>Europe,</HI> upon his occasion; I do not now speak of a secret itching desire that your Majesty had from your Cradle to surpass your An∣cestors, in enlarging your Dominions, and pushing on you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Conquests beyond the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Sambre,</HI> and <HI>Meuse;</HI> I speak
<PB N="41" REF="25"/> not neither of the Rights of the deceased Queen: I pass also in silence the Right of dependance, which is an old quarrel that your Majesty has with the Emperour, and the Princes of the Empire: I will hold my Tongue also as to what regards that secret enmity which has reign'd in all Ages, between the House of <HI>Austria</HI> and that of <HI>Bourbon.</HI></P>
<P>But I will come forthwith to matter of fact, and that which is now before us is, that your Majesty did procure to your self a War in the year, 1689. which is now four years agoe, and that upon the occasion, 1st. Of the Universal Monarchy, 2dly. Because of <HI>Pope Innocent</HI> the Ele∣venth, who oppos'd himself to all your de∣signs. 3dly. Upon occasion of the <HI>Cardi∣nal de Furstembergh.</HI> 4thly. To hinder the ruin of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. 5thly. To re-install King <HI>James</HI> in his Throne: Of all these Articles I will chuse but one, and with your Majesties permission will insist upon the last, which is in my Opinion the most important, and which I consider as an invincible obstacle to a glorious Peace, which ought to be the end of your Ma∣jesties Arms and Enterprizes. I say then, that your Majesty finds your self at this day in a great confusion, by the weight
<PB N="42" REF="26"/> of the War which you are obliged to sup∣port, which is one of the bloodiest, the most pernicious, and the most burthen∣some that <HI>France</HI> ever had. And really to run through all the Reigns that have pre∣ceded this, we do not see that <HI>Charles</HI> the Seventh, <HI>Francis</HI> the First, <HI>Charles</HI> the Eighth, <HI>Charlemain,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, no more than <HI>Louis</HI> the Thirteenth, have had so many Enemies at one time upon their Hands.</P>
<P>But that which surprizes me the most, and which I look upon as a Miracle, is, that in the midst of so many Enemies your Majesty equally enjoys your self, and gives your Orders every where with as much tranquility as if you were in a pro∣found Peace. Things being in this con∣dition I have but one thing to know of your Majesty, which I desire you to trust me with; after which I will ingage my self to lay down a way which shall infallibly conduct you to a general peace in less than two Campaigns.</P>
<P>I have already told you, <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> says his Majesty, that I put full confidence in you, and that I have chosen you as one of my best Counsellors in the condition I find my self; because really I have re∣mark'd, that my Affairs have put on ano∣ther
<PB N="43" REF="26"/> Face, &amp; run quite in another Channel from the very moment you took the com∣mand of my Army; and I know not whe∣ther my Enemies fear you more than my other Generals, or whether the Familiar Spirit, as is said, that you have to win Bat∣tles, makes you Bolder and more undaunt∣ed. Be it as it will, the Battle of <HI>Fleu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> which you won me, has been a great bene∣fit to me: It has put my tottering Affairs into a good condition; and if any other but you had had the disposal of it, I should have run a great hazard of losing it, since that fifty thousand Men of my best Troops had a great deal of trouble to de∣feat twenty four thousand which com∣pos'd the Enemies Army. I add also this circumstance, that the Victory being a long time Ballanc'd by the great resistance which the Enemies Foot made, and which you did not expect, you were also ob∣liged to encourage my Troops, which re∣fus'd to charge again the fourth time, and pulling off your Hat desir'd the Officers to put themselves in mind of the honour of <HI>France,</HI> and of the glory of their Prince; which so strongly animated them, that com∣ing to the Charge they oblig'd the Victory to declare it self for my Arms. I believe, if poor <HI>d' Humieres</HI> had been there to
<PB N="44" REF="27"/> command as he was the Campaign before, the good Man would have been in a great deal of trouble. But I much doubt, <HI>Lux∣emburgh,</HI> if the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had been at the Head of that Army, whether you would have come off so cheap as you did with Prince <HI>Waldeck.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> when I shall com∣mand against the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> I will content my self to play the cunning part; but when Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> shall Command, I pretend to go eat his Bread, and to En∣camp in his Country, and to lead him up and down where I please; the reason of it is, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is stirring and spares not his own Person, presenting himself every where in a Battle, contem∣ning danger, enjoying himself, and gi∣ving Orders without confusion.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, How did you do at the business of <HI>Leusse?</HI> for he was at the Head of that Army all the Campaign.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> I took care not to attack his Army at that time, but I just took the occasion of his departure, and with difficulty came to understand by Six of my best Spies, that he was Ar∣rived at <HI>Breda,</HI> when I made the Horse march. To deceive the Enemies by a Strata∣gem pleasant enough, I took with me
<PB N="45" REF="27"/> Messieurs the Dukes <HI>de Charters</HI> and <HI>du Main,</HI> and we went all three to <HI>Tournay</HI> with a design to see there a Play. We ar∣riv'd there about Six of the Clock in the Afternoon, it was just the Eve of the A∣ction, which was to pass the next day about 8 or 9 of the Clock in the Morning, as we had contriv'd.</P>
<P>The Spies of Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> with which he was not the best provided, did not fail to give him an account we were at the Play, as it was true; but I had before given Orders to the <HI>Sieur de Roze,</HI> to <HI>Mes∣sieurs</HI> the Counts <HI>d' Auvergne</HI> and <HI>de Ville∣roy,</HI> countenanced by the Prince <HI>de Soubise,</HI> and the Marquess <HI>de Congis,</HI> to advance very slowly with about Sixty or Eighty Squadrons divided into several parties.</P>
<P>The Comedy which they Play'd, was <HI>The Physician in Spight of himself;</HI> which being ended, one of the Players invited the Company the next day to another, call'd <HI>The Citizen turn'd Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>Drawing near Monsieur the Duke <HI>du Maine,</HI> I whisper'd him softly in the Ear, by my faith we shall have another Comedy to morrow, not to say Tragedy, for it seems to me as if it would not be very bloody.</P>
<P>That being done, we got on Horseback
<PB N="46" REF="28"/> about Nine of the Clock, and return'd by the obscurity of the Night near to your Majesties Troops. And by good Fortune there arose a thick Fog, which begun a∣bout one of the Clock in the morning, which favour'd our march so well, that we arriv'd at Eight of the Clock in the Mor∣ning in sight of the Enemy, who were suprized at our coming, and taking advan∣tage of their disorder, I Charg'd them with the Troops of your House, which I led my self to the Battle.</P>
<P>Now I think on't, <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> says his Majesty, I understood that there was one of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Guards who came headlong with his Sword in his hand with a design to kill you.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> it is true, and I escap'd a stroke from him so narrowly, that he had undoubtedly taken my Head off, if I had been tall. But as you may, when I am on Horseback, take me for Mon∣sieur <HI>Scarron,</HI> I easily put by that blow in crying out with a full Throat, Fire upon that bold Fellow.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, you dearly then bought the glory that you had to keep the Field about half an hour, by the death of my best Officers, and of a great number of brave persons of my House.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="28"/>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> your Majesty has long since used your self, to lose a great m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny Men when you would have the advantage over your Enemies.</P>
<P>As it is my Maxime to attack them or∣dinarily three against one, and that the Enemies who see themselves almost always inferiour and more feeble in number by half, fight also like Madmen, that's the reason your Majesty loses more men than they; but still you have the Glory on your side.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, if these losses are frequent, and that the War should last four or five Campaigns, as in all appear∣ance it will, I run a risque to see my self without Officers and Souldiers.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> your Majesty must bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Peace at any rate, should it cost even half your Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ects.</P>
<P>But, answers his Majesty, I had then rather hazard a general Battle, and come orderly into an open Campaign in the Face of my En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mies.</P>
<P>I am perswaded that they would not refuse it, and that would be infinitely more glorious and worthier of the name of Great, that I bear; imitating in that <HI>Charles Martel</HI> who acquir'd that name by reason of his martial humour, and of the
<PB N="48" REF="29"/> great actions he did at the Battle of <HI>Tours,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> kill'd a hundred and se∣venty five thousand <HI>Moors,</HI> that lay dead on the Spot. It seems to me that an Action like that would be incomparably better than all the Tricks and Wiles that I have made use of till now, which are no more after all than small Rencounters, which decide nothing, and only lengthen the War.</P>
<P>No, Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> that is not the way by which I pretend to conduct your Majesty, your Enemies would de∣sire no better.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> would Triumph with joy, and your Majesty cannot do them a greater favour, than to come as you say into an open field.</P>
<P>There wants but only one such like Re∣solution to annihilate, in an instant, all those Prodigies of glory, and to lose so many brave Conquests heap'd up, one upon the other, which hast cost so many Men and so much Blood; and I am persuaded that your Majesty has not yet forgot what it cost <HI>Francis</HI> the First, and St. <HI>Louis,</HI> for having expos'd themselves a little too much.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="29"/>
<P>How then, says his Majesty, do you un∣derstand it? for we must take the shortest way; my People begin to be able to do no more, and Mony becomes scarce in my Kingdom; and as we say, foresight is the Mother of Wisdom; I know what it cost me in 1672 for having staid a little too long.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> doth your Ma∣jesty absolutely wish to have a peace? I have already pray'd you several times to discover to me your most secret inten∣tions.</P>
<P>You know, says his Majesty, that I wish it passionately. But I reserve to my self the glory to grant it to my Enemies, and I fight only at present to constrain them to come and demand it of me.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> since it is so that your Majesty is absolutely resolved to have a peace; that you wish it, and seek after it, this is the way to come quick∣ly to it. Your Majesty must then at pre∣sent make <HI>Flanders</HI> the Seat of War; you must gather together your greatest force, and you must reckon to have three Armies this Campaign, to act in concert and mu∣tually to assist one another.</P>
<P>Each of these Armies must be at the least fifty thousand Men.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="30"/>
<P>For this purpose your Majesty must give Orders to Monsieur <HI>Voisin,</HI> Intendant of the Low Countries, to make with the Commissaries of Provisions, an exact computation of Provisions necessary for the maintenance of so many Troops, and to furnish the Magazines, of which the Principle ones shall be at <HI>Mons, Maubeuge, Philipville,</HI> and <HI>Dinant.</HI></P>
<P>The great Master of the Ordinance must also give order that the Ammuniti∣ons of War, as well as the great Artille∣ry be transported early to the nearest frontier places; The Count <HI>de Guiscard</HI> Governour of <HI>Dinant</HI> must take care to assemble and get ready a good number of Boats. Monsieur <HI>de Vertillac</HI> Govern∣our of <HI>Mons</HI> must likewise take care to get together all the Waggons and Carts which can be found in the Country of <HI>Hainault:</HI> He must make at the same time as well as the other Governours, a list of the Pioneers that we can have, the number of which cannot be less than Twenty thousand; and to the end that all the Troops may be there at the time of the general Rendevouse which shall be at <HI>Mons,</HI> your Majesty must presently dispatch Orders to make them march. I add also, that care must be taken to have
<PB N="51" REF="30"/> good intelligence to stir them up and main∣tain them, cost what it will, because it is the <HI>primum mobile,</HI> without which we shall build upon a Quicksand.</P>
<P>All these Resolutions being taken, there will want nothing but a Head to move so great a Body: And as the presence of Kings and Princes is the Soul and strength of their Army, and that a Prince which commands in person his Armies, aspires to an immortal glory, so there is not a Soul∣dier who fighting in the sight of his Prince, doth not employ all his valour and being animated with a desire of glory, and hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to be liberally recompens'd, doth not present himself with joy, to the greatest and most dangerous perils.</P>
<P>I advise then your Majesty to make this Campaign as you did that of <HI>Mons;</HI> your Majesty took notice that this important place was surrendred in less than fifteen Days, after the opening of the Trenches, in the sight of an Enemies Army, and in a time where the rigours of the Season oppos'd you.</P>
<P>After such a blow your Majesty may undertake what you please. That's very well, says his Majesty, but where do you judge it will be necessary to open the Cam∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign? shall it be by the Siege of <HI>Ath,</HI> or
<PB N="52" REF="31"/> <HI>Charleroy?</HI> as these places are nearest, it seems that we must begin there.</P>
<P>No Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> you must attack your Enemies in a more sensible part, <HI>Ath</HI> and <HI>Charleroy</HI> are places which will fall of themselves into your Majesties Hands.</P>
<P>What must be done then, says his Ma∣jesty, shall we go to <HI>Bombard Brussels?</HI></P>
<P>No Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh;</HI> that is not worth while, it must be a more shining enterprize, it is not reasonable your Ma∣jesty should put your self at the head of your Armie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for so small a matter.</P>
<P>What then says, his Majesty, shall we At∣tack <HI>Ostend</HI> by Sea and by Land? this loss will be very sensible to my Enemies, be∣cause that is the place where all the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Troops come to Land, and from thence we may penetrate into the Heart of the County of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>No Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> this Con∣quest is not important enough to imploy a King with an Army of one hundred and fifty thousand Men.</P>
<P>What shall be done then, says his Ma∣jesty? shall we enter into the Country of <HI>Liege</HI> to force the Prince of that Diocess to lay down his Arms, and to submit himself to my clemency?</P>
<PB N="53" REF="31"/>
<P>No, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> that expedition is more proper for <HI>Boufflers</HI> than your Majesty, it is not glorious enough for a Prince who marches only to attack invin∣cible places.</P>
<P>Ha! What then says his Majesty?</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh;</HI> your Majesty must come at the Head of one hundred and fifty thousand Men divided into three Bodies, the first of which shall be commanded by your Majesty, having un∣der you the <HI>Mareschall d' Humieres.</HI> The the second shall be under the Command of the Marquess <HI>de B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ufflers,</HI> and the third shall be remitted to my Conduct.</P>
<P>The Army being thus divided the Mar∣quess <HI>de Boufflers</HI> shall take the Van with a Body of fifteen thousand Horse, and possess the passages and avenues. The main Body of the Army being arriv'd your Majesty shall form the Siege of <HI>Namur,</HI> and by the taking of that impor∣tant place, you will render your self Master of a whole County, which is with∣out contradiction the finest of the Low Countries.</P>
<P><HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> says his Majesty, this enter∣prise is great, and this place seems to me Impregnable by it Situation; besides the building of a certain Fort which is called
<PB N="54" REF="32"/> <HI>Fort William,</HI> built within this little while renders it almost inaccessible.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> Art and Intel∣telligence must favour force, and as we say, sow the Tail of the Fox to the Skin of the Lyon.</P>
<P>I know an expedient by which half of these difficulties will be overcome, and thus it is, as I understand it. There is in the Cittadel a certain Baron <HI>de Berse,</HI> which is a Major, a Man fit to do any thing, a high spender, and much given to his pleasures. I understand that this <HI>Berse</HI> calls himself Kinsman of Madam <HI>de Main∣tenon,</HI> and that's what we want. But says, his Majesty, who has told you that this <HI>Berse</HI> will be a fit Man to hold correspon∣dence?</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> it is suffi∣cient that he is given to Debauchery. Your Majesty must charge Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> with all this business; and whilst we shall be preparing Bombs and Carcasses, she on her side must attack the strongest part of the place by fair and good guilded Letters, which will do more in one day than an Army of one hundred and fifty thousand Men in six weeks.</P>
<P>Ho! says his Majesty, if matters be so, my good and dear <HI>Maintenon</HI> will do
<PB N="55" REF="32"/> that well enough to do me a kindness.</P>
<P>But what is it she must promise him in order to engage him?</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> she must pro∣mise him one hundred thousand Livers for reward, and after the reduction of the place, a Lieutenant Generals Post. I am per∣suaded that he will accept the proposition, and that in less than eight days your Ma∣jesty will have convincing proofs thereof.</P>
<P>Ha! Well says his Majesty; suppose then for example, that he accepts the offers that <HI>Maintenon</HI> shall make him, in your opinion what method must he take to fa∣vour the enterprize?</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> it is this, he must in the first place make an exact Re∣gister of all the Provisions and Ammu∣nitions of War, which shall be found in the Cittadel; he must also make a very re∣gular draught of the strength and weakness both of the Cittadel, the <HI>Devils House,</HI> &amp; <HI>Fort William;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e must oppose in quality of Major of thc Cittadel, to all that shall be under∣taken on the behalf of the Prince of <HI>Bar∣bancon,</HI> who he must also endeavour to en∣gage, if that can be done.</P>
<P>He must inform your Majesty or some of your Generals, of all the designs, marches and countermarches of your Ene∣mies;
<PB N="56" REF="33"/> he must at the same time seem to do nothing, but to keep himself in the Cittadel, and at his ordinary Post, just till you give him notice that the Mine is to be sprung.</P>
<P>Which being done, Madam <HI>de Mainte∣non</HI> must write to him some time before to pretend to come out in a Party and suffer himself to be taken Prisoner, as if it had happen'd by imprudence.</P>
<P>The Invention is not bad, says his Ma∣jesty.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> being thus made Master of a Man, who will inform you at bottom of the least Circumstances, you ought to assure your self that from this time forth the place is surrendred.</P>
<P>If that be so, says his Majesty, we shall have as good a Bargain as that of <HI>Mons.</HI> But the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is about to repass the Sea in order to be present here early, and by what I can learn here, may put him∣self into the Field as soon as I; and having a great Army, and being accompa∣ny'd with the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> they may well dispute this Conquest with me; these two Princes are of a little hot tem∣per, so that this attacking them by so sen∣sible an enterprise will so inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame them
<PB N="57" REF="33"/> that they will not fail to get together all their Forces to oppose me.</P>
<P>I do not doubt, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> that whilst this Opera shall be playing in <HI>Flanders,</HI> we must prepare a Tragedy in <HI>England</HI> for the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>Your Majesty told me confidently the last time that King <HI>James</HI> had receiv'd Letters almost from all the Nobility and great ones of the Kingdom; besides, that there was a great number of <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aticks,</HI> that had all unanimously espou∣sed the Interest and Cause of this Prince to re-establish him upon the Throne, if your Majesty would only favour and sup∣port their enterprize by Eighteen or Twenty Thousand Men, which would make a Descent into the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, says his Majesty, and I have my self read the Letters. A Person of Quality says in express terms, that his British Majesty has nothing to do but to come, that he cannot believe with how much impatience and ear∣nestness the Grandees of the Kingdom a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the People wait for him; that all the World generally is concern'd for his re-establishment upon the Throne. That in short, they begin to make proivsions of Arms and Horses, which they gather to∣gether the most secretly the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can; with∣out
<PB N="58" REF="34"/> forgetting good Summs of Mony, which they keep ready to pay the Troops to be raised in the Kingdom, which shall consist only of persons discontented with the present Government.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> if the thing be so, that will be a great stroke; the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> must of all necessity repass the Sea in all hast to go to the succor of his three Kingdoms, and in the mean time your Majesty may do your business without op∣position, and without resistance. Your Majesty must give Orders without losing of time to the Count <HI>de Tourville</HI> to have the Fleet ready to Sail, and that a great number of Transport Ships be got toge∣ther in great diligence for the Embarquing of the Troops.</P>
<P>But says, his Majesty, I shall not be very well pleased that <HI>Tourville</HI> should run the risque of a Battle, and I see the impossi∣bility of executing such an enterprize without engaging of the two Fleets, the event whereof gives me trouble to think on't.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> here are great inclinations to a revolution; we must hazard, and give something to Fortune. She is too much a Friend of your Maje∣sties to abandon you in so fair a Field.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="34"/>
<P>Give but your Orders only to <HI>Tourville</HI> to go himself to attack the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> if he beats them, as there is all appearance he will, they being not more invincible at present than they were in 1690, all the <HI>English</HI> Fleet will range themselves on your side, and being Masters of the Sea, we can make the Descent with all li∣berty.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, the <HI>English</HI> are like Cat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the more you caress them the less they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome near you: If it should hap∣pen that they should change Opinion in the very mom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of the Battle, and that they should joyntly fight with the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> where woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Tourville</HI> be, and what would become of my poor Fleet?</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> your Majesty must banish out of your imagination any such thought; it is a deceiving fancy, and a Bird of an ill Omen which comes to trouble you. We have seen but one such Catastrophe h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> happen'd to your Majesty and you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather reason to presage a Victory than a Defeat.</P>
<P>In short, say his Majesty, since you are of that opinion and that you advise me to hazard a Bate, I will give my Orders to <HI>Tourville</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t effect.</P>
<P>But as to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> business of <HI>Namur,</HI> it
<PB N="60" REF="35"/> seems to me that one Hundred and Fifty Thousand Men is not enough to under∣take a Siege of that importance, and to possess so vast a ground as that.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> we are not now in a time when they marched with Four or Five Hundred Thousand fighting Men. We read in the History of the Kings of the first Race, that <HI>Attila</HI> King of the <HI>Huns</HI> came into the Field with an Army of five Hundred Thousand men, causing him∣self to be called the Scourge of God; but notwithstanding this great n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber, he was defeated by King <HI>Merovee,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd lost in one Battle two Hundred Tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sand of his Men.</P>
<P>Sir, it is not the great n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbers that cause Battles to be Won; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Army of Fifty Thousand Men well commanded, and which makes her movem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts regular∣ly, will beat one of an Hund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Thousand, if there happens a dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rder among them.</P>
<P>I have often heard say of the incompa∣rable Monsieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of the de∣ceased Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Army which exceeded the number of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fty Thousand Men, incommoded herself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Gene∣ral that Govern'd it.</P>
<P>Besides Sir, I have mad just computa∣tion
<PB N="61" REF="35"/> of the Troops of your Enemies; I suppose also that they should be put alto∣gether, they would not then make one Hundred Thousand Men, so that your Majesty having Fifty Thousand more, you will be in a condition to Besiege the place and observe their Motions.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, you have supposed that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> will find himself obliged to return in all hast to <HI>England,</HI> and that consequently the Enemy having no longer this Prince commanding at their Head, who is their greatest Spur, would stand still unmoveable, contenting them∣selves to be Spectators, which is to see the Medal just on its fair side: But I pray let us view the Reverse, and let us suppose that he should stay at the Head of his Ar∣my, as this Prince has long since sought an occasion to signalize himself in, and to give me Battle; seeing me engaged in a Seige of this Consequence, if the fancy should take him to come and attack me, and that I being beat should be obliged to quit it, what shame and what confusion will that be to me, who boast my self to have the invincibility of <HI>Achilles?</HI></P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> your Majesty has nothing less to doubt, than that I will make you so just a draught of the ground,
<PB N="62" REF="36"/> of the Avenues and Defiles which cover the place, that when your Majesty shall be once made Master, of them with an Army of one Hundred and Fifty Thousand Fighting men, as it hath been said, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> cannot at∣tack you with an Army of Two Hundred Thousand Men, without hazard of being beaten. Your Majesty ought to Encamp between the <HI>Sambre</HI> and the <HI>Meufe,</HI> and besides that you will be cover'd by those two Rivers, you will have at your Right the Army of the Marquess <HI>de Bouffters,</HI> which will cover you on that side. As to the other Body of the Army, of which I shall have the Command, that shall possess all the ground between <HI>Namur</HI> and the small River of <HI>Mehaigne;</HI> which is just the only place at which the Enemy can make their Attack, if so be they have a mind to it; besides, many advantages that I could draw from the Situation of the Country, which is cut off by Defiles and Woods, there wants but a small Ri∣ver to Stop your Enemies, the <HI>Mehaigne</HI> or the <HI>Orme</HI> would serve me always for an Obstacle, so that your Majesty has no cause to apprehend any danger I will cover it so well with my Army, that you will have no more reason to fear, than if you were at <HI>Versailles,</HI> near your good <HI>Maintenon.</HI></P>
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>
<P>But at least, says his Majesty, you must promise me to avoid all engaging, and to Encamp your self so well, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> mav rather dream of any other thing than to force you to fight. I am appre∣hensive of nothing more than of a Battle, and if I should be present and happen to lose it, I should make an irreparable breach to my Glory.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> rest satisfied thereupon.</P>
<P>Let your Majesty only give your Or∣ders, to the end that all may be ready; and that the Troops come early; especi∣ally those of <HI>Catalonia, Savoy,</HI> and <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> which are the Provinces that are far∣thest off. As to the event, I take it upon my self, and I will always be answerable for it, being perswaded that this Conquest will cost your Majesty no more than that of <HI>Mons,</HI> and that you will receive not only great advantages, but that it will put you into an infallible way of obtaining a Peace, which I wish with all my Heart.</P>
<P>As soon as Monsieur <HI>de Luxemburgh</HI> was gone out, the King caus'd Monsieur <HI>de Catinat</HI> to be call'd in, and bid him make him in few words, a Report of the con∣dition in which he left the Affairs of <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Catinat</HI> says, Sir, I have sufficiently inform'd your Majesty by my Letters of the particulars of the War of <HI>Italy,</HI> &amp; of the care that I have taken to ac∣quit my self worthily of the Government of your Army with which your Majesty was willing to Honour me</P>
<P>And if I had not all the success that I could have well wished the last Campaign which was that of 1691. I have never∣theless done as much as lay in any Man's power with so small a number as I had. But the arrival of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> in <HI>Piedmont</HI> spoil'd all by the great num∣ber of <HI>Germans</HI> which he brought with him, which being joyn'd with the Troops of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> Form'd an Army stronger than mine by more than half. This inequality of Force stop'd immediate∣ly the happy Progress I had made in the beginning of the Campaign; neverthe∣less without going out of my natural Seat.</P>
<P>I made all the movements I thought my self oblig'd to make, to cover the Country, to guard the Passages, and to shun an Engagement, to which they would have drawn me, your Majesty having ex∣presly forbid me; and that was a great fortune to me to have to do with <HI>Germans,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="37"/> who gave me the time well to retrench, and to possess my self of all the Posts, after having left in <HI>Carmaniole</HI> Four or Five Thou∣sand Men, and caused all the Hills and Passages of <HI>Suza</HI> to be taken up. As to the Shock your Majesties Armies suffer'd at the Siege of <HI>Coni</HI> (which Monsieur <HI>de Bulonde</HI> had the imprudence to abandon after he had his Trenches open'd against it for many days, it was sufficiently counterba∣lanc'd by the small progress the <HI>Imperia∣lists</HI> made; because, besides their coming late into the Field, the misintelligence which reign'd amongst their Generals ab∣solutely broke the course of their Enter∣prizes which were terminated at the ta∣king of <HI>Carmaniole.</HI> The Extract of their Counsels of War, I had by means of a Pension which I paid to one of their Ge∣nerals, (as I acquainted your Majesty by a Letter) was of great Service to me, and I made use of one Brother <HI>Recolet,</HI> a <HI>German,</HI> by whom I had my be Corre∣spondences to receive my Letters by a sure hand, which were brought to me by one named <HI>Jenet,</HI> a <HI>Savoyard</HI> by Nation, who went and took them in a Trunk of an old Tree, where the brother <HI>Recolet</HI> had took a care to put them. I then understood that in their Council of War, in which
<PB N="66" REF="38"/> the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> presided joyntly with the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the Count <HI>de Schom∣bergh</HI> was to command the <HI>Hugneu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> and the old return'd Refugees made this following proposal.</P>
<P><HI>That an irruption should be made into</HI> Dauphine <HI>and</HI> Provence, <HI>go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng thereinto by the Vallie of</HI> Keiras, <HI>after having made them∣selves Masters of the Castle. That from thence they might easily seize upon the small City of</HI> Guillestre; <HI>and that Three Leagues from thence they might continue their march to force the City of</HI> Ambrun, <HI>where there is a very fine Archbishoprick. That being once made masters of the most advantagious places of high</HI> Dauphine, <HI>they should not fail to carry the dread and terrour throughout the whole Province, which being one of the most oppress'd of</HI> France, <HI>by the Taxes and great Imposts that it pays to his Majesty, and ruin'd on the other side by the frequent passage of the Souldi∣ers, it would not fail to rise and take up Arms against her natural Prince. That the great number of new Catholicks which were in that place, would undoubtedly find out a way for a revolt. That as for him he was of this opinion, that there was no time to be lost, the Season being already advanced but too far; that the places which remain'd behind possest by the</HI> French, <HI>would give them no distur∣bance;
<PB N="67" REF="38"/> that they should only leave a good Bo∣dy of the Army upon the Frontiers to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cure</HI> Piedmont, <HI>to make Head against the Army o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Catinat, <HI>and to keep the Garrison of</HI> Ca∣sal <HI>and</HI> Pignerol <HI>in awe.</HI></P>
<P>I acknowledge freely Sir, that this Project gave me a great deal of trouble, and that I fear'd very much that the Bal∣lance would have lean'd to that side; be∣cause truly according to the rules of War, and the true interests of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and of his Allies, they might thereby cut out a great deal of business for your Majesty, and put me out of a condition to oppose them, because I should have immediately been obliged to divide the Body of my Army, which was already but too small, and I should have found my self in a condition to have held out the Campaign no longer.</P>
<P>To come back to the Count <HI>de Schom∣bergh</HI> who had resolved upon these con∣clusions that I have now reported; The Count <HI>Caraffa,</HI> who commanded the Impe∣rial Troop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, spoke immediately after him, and said, <HI>That in truth this Resolution was judicious, but that it seem'd too bold an attempt to undertake entring into an Ene∣mies Country; to force an Army that possest the Avenues and the passages, and which was
<PB N="68" REF="39"/> advantageously intrench'd; besides that the Winter which came on apace, did not permit that they should at so great a distance, engage themselvss in an unknow Country, and run a hazard of being cut off; that they might ex∣pose an Army to great danger by following the advice of</HI> Schombergh, <HI>and that that was not all, to enter into an Enemies Country, but also to bring the Army back again safe and sound. That he did not see how they could succeed in such p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ojects, whilst the Enemies should possess all the nearest places that made them Masters of all</HI> Savoy, <HI>and put all</HI> Pied∣mont <HI>under contribution, if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y had not al∣ways an Army there to cover it. That as for him he was of a quite contrary opinion to that of</HI> Monsieur de Schombergh; <HI>that he did not remember he had read, that the</HI> Caesars <HI>and the</HI> Alexanders, <HI>who had been great Cap∣tains, ever practis'd any thing like this in the whole course of their Wars: In short, he con∣cluded, that it was very proper, with submissi∣on to better advice, to begin the Campaign by the Siege of</HI> Carmaniole, <HI>that after that place had yielded, he judg'd it fit that the rest of the time should be employ'd to treat early for Winter Quarters with the Princes of</HI> Italy; <HI>that the Imperial Troops would be very much fatigued after such a Siege, and
<PB N="69" REF="39"/> would be then only fit for nothing else but to take up their Winter Quarters.</HI></P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Schombergh</HI> being mind∣ful of the Prince of <HI>Orange's</HI> interest, who had sent him into <HI>Savoy</HI> to put him∣self at the Head of the <HI>Hugonots,</HI> could not without being concern'd hear what Count <HI>Caraffa</HI> propos'd; and altho he was of a sweet and pacifick temper, a quality which he inherited from his deceased Fa∣ther, as well as that that gave great hopes of his being one of the best Captains of the Age, could not nevertheless persuade himself to be quiet; he had too long seen himself idle against his will. Besides, he could not get it into his head whatever, he tryd to force himself to believe, that a whole Campaign ought to be pass'd in the Siege of so small a place as <HI>Carmaniolle,</HI> whilst they should neglect one of the fair∣est occasions that ever was offer'd for the Allies to enter into <HI>France.</HI> He re∣ply'd then to all that had been propos'd by Count <HI>Caraffa, that he was too old a pra∣ctitioner in War not to have a full knowledg of the Situation of the Country, of the Roads, of the Woods, of the Marshes, of the Defiles, of the Mountains, of the Rivers, of the Bridges, of the watry places—, of the Passa∣ges, and in one word of all the places by which
<PB N="70" REF="40"/> they can pretend to enter into</HI> Dauphine: <HI>He added to this his knowledg, that of having studied from his youth, the Genius, the Man∣ners, the interest; the jealousies, the strength, and the weakness, and generally all the pre∣dominant Passions of the</HI> French <HI>Nation, in which he had been brought up. That a Gene∣ral of some consideration, and who strove to understand his Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, ought thoroughly to be ac∣quainted with these things. And that he should be very sorry to have it disputed w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th him by another; that if he should be obliged to support his discourse by examples drawn from the greatest Captai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, he could make it appear as clear as the Sun at Noon, that the</HI> Caesars <HI>and the</HI> Alexanders, <HI>as well as</HI> Charles <HI>the Fifth, the</HI> Turennes <HI>and the</HI> Condes, <HI>and infinite other modern Generals have not had any other Principle in the Art of War, That he propos'd nothing rashly; but he pre∣tended to give to the Council so just a draught of the design they propos'd, that he was persuaded it was not so much to be rejected as the Count</HI> Caraffa <HI>would have insinuated.</HI> Thereupon putting his Hand in his Pock∣et he pull'd out many Writings. The first was a circular Letter in form of a Manifesto, which was to be dispers'd up∣on their coming into the Country to stir up the People to embrace the party of the
<PB N="71" REF="40"/> Allies, which was conceiv'd in these terms.</P>
<P><HI>That all the Inhabitants of High and Low</HI> Dauphine <HI>were exhorted to come and joyn the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms of his</HI> Britannick <HI>Majesty, and of his Royal Highness the Duke of</HI> Savoy, <HI>who came with a pote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Army to their relief, to help them to shake off the Yoke, under which they had groan'd so many years. That the old Catholicks as well as the new Converts, without distincti n of Religion shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be equally received by the clemency of these Princes who tender'd them their assistance; That God had already on many occasions declar'd himself the Protector of the Armies of the Allies, and that they ought n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to doubt but that he would bless their conquests and put them quickly into a con∣dition to deliver all</HI> France <HI>from her great op∣pression.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That they protested that nothing in the ex∣ercise of Religion should be changed, but that every one should have full liberty of conscience, like that the People so peaceably enjoyed in the reigns of</HI> Henry <HI>the Fourth and</HI> Louis <HI>in the Thirteenth. They declared also that all the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>btors should be discharged who should sub∣mit themselves, and come and implore the pro∣tection of their Deliverers; and lastly, that they would maintain the Clergy in their dig∣nities, the Gentlemen in their Lands, the
<PB N="72" REF="41"/> Merchants in the freedom of their Trade, the Countrymen in peace and quiet, and the Ma∣gistrates in their Authority for the preserving of the Law and the Administration of ju∣stice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That they should live under a Government far different from that in which they had liv'd, and that they should at once be delivered from the great miseries to which they had been re∣duc'd, by the insupportable and Tyrannical charge of Taxes and Imposts which they were obliged to pay to a Sovereign, who had made his free People, miserable Slaves.</HI></P>
<P>After the reading of this Manifesto, he shewed several Letters, which had been written to him by the most considerable of the Nobility of high and low <HI>Dauphine,</HI> the chief whereof were also read in the Council according to order, as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>But it was too early Days then, since that the providence of God has reserv'd you till this Day, to be one of the Principal Instruments made use of to restore to our Poor <HI>Sion,</HI> her antient splend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r and tranquillity. We heartily pray to God that he would be pleased to take you into his Holy Protection, and would bless all your just designs.

<P>I engage you my word upon the Faith of a Man of Honour, that there would be a gene∣ral rising, if you would enter into the Coun∣try. The fear I am in lest my Letter should miscarry, doth not give me leave to send you the particulars of all things; rely upon the little I have said; let me know the time and place, and believe me without reserve <HI>Sir,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>WE are under the greatest trouble in the World, to understand that the design you had verbally propos'd to his Electoral High∣ness of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> to enter into <HI>Dauphine</HI> by the Valley of <HI>Keiras,</HI> was not receiv'd as you expected, and as we wish'd.

We supplicate you, I say, unanimously to come back to your Post, and to be willing once more to employ your interest to make their Highnesses and Count <HI>Caraffa</HI> un∣derstand, that it is so important a thing to enter into <HI>Dauphin</HI> this Campaign, taking advantage of the weakness of the places, of the good dis∣position in which the People are at present found, and of an assured Conquest of the whole Country, if you come streight to <HI>Gre∣noble,</HI> that if you neglect it, I do Prophesie there will remain no more to the Allies than an immort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l dissatisfaction for having gone no farther, when you might have penetrated even into the Heart of <HI>France.</HI></P>

<SIGNED>Yours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Count <HI>Caraffa</HI> seeing that Monsieur <HI>de Schomberg</HI> came immediately to matter of fact, and that he maintain'd his Opinion by strong proofs, and remarking be∣sides, that his Electoral Highness of <HI>Bava∣ria,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Leganez,</HI> the Count <HI>de Palfi,</HI> and the Marquess <HI>de Pianese,</HI> who were all present, seem'd in some measure to be willing to applaud him, withdrew im∣mediately out of the Council, and went home, protesting that he would remain firm in his first resolution; that the Coun∣cil might resolve what they thought fit; but for him he knew what he had to do, and that the Imperial Troops of which he had the chief Command, should make no other motion than what he should or∣der them; that he knew the Emperour's mind, and so it was needless to lose time in employing it to deliberate there∣upon.</P>
<P>This way of procedure, which was so little expected, extreamly surpriz'd
<PB N="76" REF="43"/> the other Generals. But the Count <HI>de Schomberg</HI> appear'd so sensibly touch'd at it, that he without any more ado present∣ly complain'd, and also afterwards ac∣quainted them, that he was so little sa∣tisfied in <HI>Italy,</HI> that he e'en resolv'd to go back into <HI>Holland,</HI> or into <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> where he had formerly Commanded the Troops of his Electoral Highness of <HI>Bran∣denbourg.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was no less concern'd, that after having Travel∣led through all <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> to come by hard Journeys into <HI>Piedmont,</HI> where he was expected with such impatience, which he did, notwithstanding the access of a Fever, which he found very hard to get rid of, without reckoning a Thousand other unhappy mifortunes which he felt, during the length of his Journey: And all this in hopes to have gather'd Lawrels at his Arrival; if he met with nothing less, that he must rest contented, as also his other Companions, with an Idea only which they formed to themselves of a Glorious Campaign.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was he who lost most by these Disputes, and whom the matter touch'd nearest; but as he had not the experience of other Generals, he found himself not in a condition with a heat
<PB N="77" REF="43"/> proper for the cause, to maintain an Opi∣nion so plausible and so disinterested as that of Count <HI>Scomberg</HI>'s appear'd.</P>
<P>Besides, he was willing to consent to it, because they look'd upon this undertaking as the only remedy which presented it self to incommode their Enemy, and to dis∣charge their poor States from the Insup∣portable burthen of the Auxiliary Troops, which would Triumph with Joy, said he, if they should see themselves once Posted in the Enemies Country, to take their Winter Quarters there, which is just the grievance of the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>But the bitter Draught that Count <HI>Ca∣raffa</HI> could not swallow, was quite another thing. He saw amongst the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> plenty enough of all things. It is a Country flowing with Milk and Hony; whereas in <HI>Dauphine,</HI> he saw nothing but Melancholy Deserts, and People already ruin'd by the War, which was more than sufficient to make him take another reso∣lution.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was of the Opinion of the Duke his Cousin, and their interests were too common, not to be united toge∣ther. He added that he could not think self-willdness was capable to produce so great disorders, and that Princes were
<PB N="78" REF="44"/> happy when they were the only Masters, and the Armies Victorious, when they were Commanded by one Chief; that these three years that the Wars continu'd in <HI>Italy</HI> their disagreement had alone done more hurt than the Enemy; for 'twas this an∣gry Goddess of Discord that came inces∣santly to trouble the most important re∣solutions, and to furnish new Seeds of Di∣vision and Dispute, which oftentimes ari∣ses from a slight occasion: That if these contests should be kept up any longer, and that we should amuse our selves thus to pass whole Campaigns in deliberating, and principally the precious time which was destin'd to enter into Action, This would be just to play the Game which <HI>France</HI> would desire; that we draw∣ing our selves insensibly into Winter, which is the Mother of business for her, she would have a new occasion to cry out as she use to do of Victory, because she is assured of her design, and takes justly the time of our Retreat and lying in our Winter Quarters.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Leganez</HI> Governour of the <HI>Milanese</HI> was altogether of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Opinion, (that is to say) <HI>Piano veremo,</HI> and being full of confidence and good will, he catch't at all, and was ready to embrace
<PB N="79" REF="44"/> the first or second resolution, or else both together, if that could have been done and agreed to with good Judg∣ment.</P>
<P>But as the good Man is as great a Wit, as was his Predecessor, so he seems to have a little more good nature, and the glorious House from which he is descended serves him for a Pattern; he contents himself nevertheless to follow the Crowd and plurality of Voices, for fear to fall into some Heresie, if he should have dar'd to have advanc'd from his own Opinion a third project. In a word, the resolution taken to enter into <HI>France,</HI> was the most proper for him, and for all the other States of <HI>Italy.</HI> And if the Count <HI>de Caraffa</HI> would by misfortune have yiel∣ded to it, that had been done. But as I have already insinuated to your Majesty, I had so well fetter'd him with Chains of Gold, that he saw himself not in a condi∣tion to make one single Step towards it. Count <HI>Palfi,</HI> a good <HI>German</HI> also, otherwise a brave Man, and the Marquiss <HI>de Pianese,</HI> were absolutely of the Opinion of Count <HI>Schomberg,</HI> and could not consent to the <HI>Negative</HI> without regret.</P>
<P>The busyness having then been tra∣vers'd by the selfconceitedness of Count
<PB N="80" REF="45"/> <HI>Caraffa,</HI> who, as I have represented it, had no Body with him; but as he had on his side all the Imperial Troops which made the principal Force of their Army, he constrain'd all the other Generals in spight of all they had to say, to submit to the Law of his Judgment; so that not be∣ing able to do otherwise, they resolv'd at last to act joyntly with him, and to open the Campaign by the Siege of <HI>Carma∣noille,</HI> of which they made themselves Ma∣sters after a great deal of resistance, from a part of your Majesties Troops which fought bravely.</P>
<P>After this Conquest they talk'd no more of any Project for the rest of the Cam∣paign. <HI>Caraffa</HI> keeping faithfully his word which he had so solemnly sworn, would hear talk of nothing more but Winter Quarters, for fear of violating his Oath, and passing for a perjur'd Person; so putting immediately his Hand to the Work, he began to treat about Con∣tributions with the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> who finding themselves in more trouble than if they had an Enemies Army at their Gates, found no better way to take, to preserve Peace and repose in their Coun∣try, than to consent to the payment of great Summs which they demanded of
<PB N="81" REF="45"/> them, rather than to see their Inhabitants expos'd to the Insolence and Fury of the Souldiers, who were ready to fall upon them as upon Innocent Doves.</P>
<P>The Republick of <HI>Genoua,</HI> and the Dukes of <HI>Mantua</HI> and <HI>Modena</HI> will for a good while remember the coming of the <HI>Germans</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> and the other States will have no reason to forget them.</P>
<P>But to make short, since your Majesty orders me, and that the time to make your designs appear this Campaign, ap∣proacheth, I will add only to all I have said already concerning the Affairs of <HI>Italy,</HI> that I thought fit, as I have let your Majesty know, to make advantage of the distance of the <HI>German</HI> Troops which were found dispers'd here and there in several Countries, and to lay Siege to <HI>Montmelian,</HI> and secure by this important Fort the Conquests with which it had pleas'd God to bless your Arms in <HI>Savoy.</HI> I undertook then this Siege in a time, when the rigors of the Season making us feel the utmost extremity, not to speak of a great number of other unhappy ob∣stacles, which seem'd to oppose so great an undertaking, I found my self several times oblig'd to quit it; but as your Ma∣jesty
<PB N="82" REF="46"/> had expresly order'd me to hazard all, I at last made it submit to your obe∣dience in less time than I had propos'd to my self.</P>
<P><HI>Catinat,</HI> answer me, I pray you, says the King, to what I shall ask you. I have a great design in <HI>Flanders</HI> that I pretend to execute some weeks hence, and for this purpose I shall have occasion for an Army of one hundred and fifty thousand Men. As the Troops that I have in <HI>Bra∣bant</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> are not sufficient to make this number, may I well dispose of fifteen or sixteen thousand Men of the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oops which are under your command in <HI>Savoy?</HI> As you are the only one of all my Generals who knows the Map of <HI>Italy</HI> best, the designs of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the Genius of the <HI>Italian</HI> Nation, hav∣ing travel'd in the habit of a <HI>Carmelite</HI> thro' all those Countries, according to the or∣der I had given you, in hopes that you would be one day more proper to do me important Services on that side, and it was you who had the care of the buying of the City of <HI>Cazal,</HI> having received the Sum which I had agreed with the Duke of <HI>Mantoua</HI> to pay unto him for it.</P>
<P>Answer me, I pray you, do you be∣lieve me to be in a condition safe enough
<PB N="83" REF="46"/> to withdraw my Troops, and could you well make head against the <HI>Germans,</HI> if I only leave you an Army of nine thou∣sand Men?</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Catinat,</HI> your Province of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> which was the most expos'd of all your Kingdom, and into which your Enemies have often flatter'd them∣selves to enter with a great Army, need to fear nothing further, since the tak∣ing of <HI>Monmelian.</HI> This place as well as <HI>Pignerol, Susa</HI> and <HI>Nice,</HI> of the side of <HI>Provence,</HI> are more than sufficient to cover it and to put all into a profound secu∣rity.</P>
<P>But let us turn the Scale, says his Ma∣jesty: If the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> making advan∣tage of your weakness and of the small number you will have there, should hap∣pen on a sudden to take a Resolution of forcing the Passages, and of entring into my Kingdom, and that jointly with <HI>Schombergh,</HI> who commands the <HI>Hugonots</HI> and the old return'd Refugees they should come to enter into <HI>Dauphi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> and put all that Province under Contribution; for without flatteri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g my self I fear the old return'd Refugees, and my new Converts coming once to form themselves into Troops, and to joyn them, would m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke
<PB N="84" REF="47"/> a formidable Army, for they would pro∣cure me a great deal of trouble, and might in time make this Province to rise, which is already but too much disaffected, because it is that part of my Kingdom that I have always the least minded, and which has been the most oppress'd by the great Taxes that it pays me, and lately by the passage of the Souldiers and the Winter Quarters which has almost made them desolate. That if once this Barrier come to be forc'd, my Enemies might from <HI>Dauphine</HI> enter into the Country of <HI>Lyons,</HI> Forests and Boucollois, all being o∣pen on that side, and do me more hurt in one Campaign than I have done to them since the War was declar'd.</P>
<P>Sir, answers <HI>Catinat,</HI> rest satisfi∣ed in this, and let not your Majesty for this stop the course of your great under∣takings: I will take care of <HI>Dauphine;</HI> give me only the charge of it, as you have done for the time pass'd, and confide en∣tirely in me.</P>
<P>But, says the King, you may be mista∣ken <HI>Catirat.</HI> Do not you know that Men alter, as well as their Opinions, and that such a Resolution is quickly ta∣ken?</P>
<PB N="85" REF="47"/>
<P>Sir, answers <HI>Catinat,</HI> that your Ma∣jesty may not trouble you self, I engage you my word upon the Faith of an honest Man, that your Enemies shall undertake nothing on that side, and that the disunion amongst them will always be the ruin of their undertakings.</P>
<P>I wish it might be so, says his Majesty; for if I were assured of the contrary, I would chuse rather to remain all the Cam∣paign upon the defensive, waiting for the Winter to make a Siege, than to suffer that my Enemies should give me on that side any blemish to my glory; and that a Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> whom I formerly treat∣ed as one of my Pages, should boast to have encamp'd at the Gates of <HI>Grenoble:</HI> I believe I should dye with grief if that should come to my Ears: For what shame would not that be to receive Law from a Prince to whom I gave it all the course of my Reign?</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Catinat,</HI> I add for Con∣clusion, that your Majesty needs not to fear any thing from the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> nor from the old return'd Refugees. Your Majesty has given me with the Command of your Army a golden Key, which has the secret to open the Hearts, and as the head of <HI>Medusa</HI> to convert Men into Rocks
<PB N="86" REF="48"/> and make them immoveable; so that when the Skin of the Lion shall fail me, I shall al∣ways have that of the Fox, and that will be more than sufficient to stop all the un∣dertakings of the <HI>Savoyards</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> if so be they should seem to undertake more than the last Campaign. I add to all these Reflections, that they being used to come into the Field after that the Troops of your Majesty have done their business, if occasion should require it, it would always be time enough to form an Army of Detachments, that we shall have to oppose them in all their designs. Be∣sides, I will manage so well the nine thou∣sand that your Majesty shall leave me, and I will cause Monsieur <HI>de la Rai, de Bache Villiers,</HI> and <HI>de Vins</HI> to go to their Posts who shall cover the Province so advanta∣geously that we shall have nothing to fear.</P>
<P>The King being sufficiently inform'd of the affairs of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> pass'd to those of <HI>Cat∣talonia,</HI> and said in presence of Monsieur <HI>de Catinat,</HI> that he had not judg'd it fit to call Monsieur <HI>de Nouailles</HI> to this Council of War, because that having nothing to ap∣prehend from the part of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> but some feeble Rodomontades, and that the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermosa</HI> their General, having more care to say his Prayers by his
<PB N="87" REF="48"/> great <HI>Pater Noster</HI> Beads, which he car∣ries hanging at the Guard of his Sword, than of the Stratagems of War, he had also made choice of a General fitter to re∣gulate the Affairs of the House of the de∣ceased Poor Madam <HI>de Fontange,</HI> of which he had the charge whilst she liv'd, than to have commanded an Army any thing considerable; that having besides given the Government of <HI>Languedoc</HI> to his keep∣ing, and that even till one of the three young Princes should be of age to fill it, he was willing also to give him the com∣mand of the Army in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> as well by reason of the nearness of the place, as also of the knowledge which he hath of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongue and Manners. But he had so small a number in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> that it was not worth while to talk of it; that at most we might reckon upon three thousand Men of eight that were there; the five thousand remaining being de∣sign'd to make the Campaign, and to act against the <HI>Miquelets.</HI> His Majesty added, that it was true, that he had advice by the means of his Spies at the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> that the Catholick King caus'd a Fleet to be Arm'd of 14 or 15 Men of War, which were to be jointly com∣manded with the Gallies, by Admiral
<PB N="88" REF="49"/> <HI>Papichini,</HI> to cruise in the <HI>Medditerranean,</HI> from the moment that the Count <HI>d' Estrees</HI> should be put to Sea, and that they seem'd to have a mind to attempt something upon the Coast of <HI>Provence</HI> to favour the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>But that he gave so little Faith to all those discourses, that he made no diffi∣culty to say, that since they had undertaken nothing like it the two last Campaigns, it was a proof of their weakness, and that he had by consequence nothing to fear on that side. From the affairs of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> his Majesty came to those of <HI>Germany,</HI> and order'd immediately that <HI>Catinat</HI> should go out of the Chamber, and that the <HI>Ma∣reschal de Lorge</HI> should come in, who commanded his Army upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and said to him, <HI>de Lorge,</HI> I pray you tell me a word of the condition in which you left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Troops.</P>
<P>Sir, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> your Army upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> has suffer'd much by the diseases which have Reign'd all this Cam∣paign, and also it finds its self much weaken'd by the Death of so great a num∣ber of brave Officers and Souldiers; not to speak of the desertion which has been also very great, notwithstanding any thing we could do to hinder it. Never∣theless
<PB N="89" REF="49"/> by the care that the Marquess <HI>d' Ʋxelles,</HI> Monsieur <HI>de Melac</HI> and I have taken, your Majesties Army is at present in an incomparable better condition than it was</P>
<P>We have given it good Winter Quar∣ters, which has much contributed to it's refreshment, and cause the Diseases to a∣bate: After that we have set our selves to work with heat and success to make the necessary recruits to render the Regi∣ments compleat, and that by the means of Mony, which we are to consider in that Country as the <HI>Materia prima,</HI> and the second cause, which makes that it is ador'd among the <HI>Germans,</HI> and that by this means your Majesty will never want Souldiers.</P>
<P>The King seeing Monsieur <HI>de Melac,</HI> who followed the Mareschal <HI>de Lorge,</HI> ad∣dress'd himself to him, and said to him, <HI>Melac,</HI> have you brought a List of the Villages that you have burnt in <HI>Germany,</HI> and particularly in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> and along the <HI>Rhine?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Melac</HI> answer'd, Sir, I have not yet made it, but if your Majesty desires it, I will make one immediately.</P>
<P>His Majesty answer'd him, you will do me a kindness, and you must take care at the
<PB N="90" REF="50"/> same time to mark those that remain to be burnt.</P>
<P>Afterwards his Majesty address'd him∣self to the Marquess <HI>d' Ʋxelles,</HI> who had likewise follow'd the Duke <HI>de Lorge,</HI> and said to him, <HI>d' Ʋxelles,</HI> I am not altogether satisfied with the way of your living, and I have heard many disadvantagious things to your Reputation; for I am in∣form'd every day that you plunge your self into the dirty Debaucheries of the Duke <HI>de Vendosme;</HI> altho' on the other side I do not dislike your Services; and I have given you sufficient marks by con∣ferring upon you the charge of Lieutenant General, in memory of the Siege of <HI>Mayence,</HI> that you defended seven weeks together against an Army of one hundred thousand Men, which had at their Head the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and all the Electors of the Empire.</P>
<P>The Marquess <HI>d' Ʋxelles</HI> answer'd, Sir, I very well see that I have great Enemies at Court: But I pray your Majesty to be persuaded that all these false reports that have come to your Ears, do owe their Birth only to the jealousy and misunder∣standing of some Generals, whom I shall name in time and place, in order to clear my self when your Majesty shall please to order me.</P>
<PB N="91" REF="50"/>
<P>His Majesty answered, the time is too short to enter into such a discussion; grea∣ter affairs call me into <HI>Flanders;</HI> so I re∣serve to inform my self of all these matters at my return from the Cam∣paign.</P>
<P>After which his Majesty turning him∣self towards Monsieur the Duke <HI>de Lorge,</HI> said to him, <HI>de Lorge,</HI> I have call'd you to assist in this Council of War to reveal to you a great design. I have resolv'd to march into <HI>Flanders</HI> at the Head of an Ar∣my of one hundred and fifty thousand Men; the time presses, and the undertak∣ing is important, so I shall have occasion for all my Forces. I have already given orders to make all the regulate Troops to come, that I have in <HI>Italy,</HI> except nine thousand Men; for according to the re∣port that <HI>Catinat</HI> has just now made me, I judge that my Enemies will undertake nothing on that side.</P>
<P>Besides, that I have let the Duke <HI>de Nouailles</HI> know that my will was that he should make a Detachment of three thou∣sand Men, of his best Troops, and that he should make them march apace, to the end they might be in the nick of time at the Rendevouse.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="51"/>
<P>The business in Hand then is to know the number of the Troops of my Army in <HI>Germany,</HI> the Detachment that you are in a condition to make, and those you have occasion for to cover my Conquests with on that side.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd the Mareschal <HI>de Lorge,</HI> your Majesties Army in <HI>Germany</HI> may amount to about fifty thousand Men, reck∣oning the Garrisons of <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> of <HI>Phi∣lipsbourg,</HI> and the other places; so you may depend upon a Detachment of twenty or twenty five thousand Men; the other twenty five thousand which remain shall be order'd for the preservation of the Country, of which I can at any time form an Army of ten thousand Men, which will be more than sufficient to ob∣serve the Enemy, and the rest shall be distributed in the Garrisons of the Fron∣tier places.</P>
<P>But, answer'd his Majesty, could not the <HI>Germans</HI> during that time make use of your weakness and undertake the Siege of <HI>Philipsbourg,</HI> or <HI>Landaw,</HI> or else <HI>Mont Royal,</HI> that the deceased Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> look'd upon as the Flower of all my Fortresses, and insomuch that he was resolv'd to have it at any rate? Or at least can they not make some considerable ravage in the
<PB N="93" REF="51"/> Country, and oblige me to quit a great undertaking half begun? As I do not march unprofitably, but to gather Law∣rels, and that Victory may follow me wherever I go, I should have an inconcei∣vable trouble, if a Reverse should happen to me, and that that should fall out for having fail'd of good Intelligence.</P>
<P>Sir, reply'd the Mareschal <HI>de Lorge,</HI> the <HI>Germans</HI> go not so fast in business; your Majesty makes them gain at this time more Conquests, than they will make in three Campaigns.</P>
<P>They are too great Friends to their Ease and good Cheer to forsake their Win∣ter Quarters in the Month of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>Now I think on't <HI>de Lorge,</HI> says his Majesty, How did you Govern your self the last Campaign, which was that of 1691. for I hear that their Army was strong.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> this Campaign was pass'd like the rest, that is to say, in disputing the Ground. But as the Con∣federate Army, commanded by the late Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> came very late into the Field, which is the Original Sin of the <HI>Germans,</HI> that of your Majesty had two Months sooner the Enemies Country at her discretion.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="52"/>
<P>After having caus'd the Forrage to be consum'd on the Right and Left, as I had Orders from your Majesty to keep my self upon the Defensive, I repass'd the <HI>Rhine</HI> upon the Arrival of the Enemies Ar∣my.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> pretended to fol∣low me; but as he wanted more necessa∣ries than I to make a Bridg, so I was on the other side before he was ready, and made my self first Master of the best Posts. The Marquiss <HI>d Ʋxelles</HI> made on his side, with a Flying Camp, all the necessary Marches and Counter-marches, as well to cover the Place, as to give false Alarms to the Enemies. Monsieur <HI>de Melac</HI> open'd the Campaign by thirty Villages that he Burnt with a very good Grace. As he is the ablest Incendiary of <HI>Europe,</HI> so he has reason to hope for a Mareschals Staff for recompence.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, How did then the Designs of the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> end?</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> this Elector was a good Prince, made much of by the God <HI>Mars,</HI> but a lover of Joy, of Pleasure and of good Chear; Brave otherwise as the Sword he wore. But as he was not absolute in the Army, and that I had the secret to divide them, I knew always be∣forehand
<PB N="95" REF="52"/> by the means of my Spies and my Intelligence, all the Resolutions taken in their Council: Besides I do not know a Nation more lyable to be Corrupted than the <HI>Brabancons;</HI> at the sight of a Golden Calf they all Humble and Prostrate themselves. St. <HI>Louis</HI> was a great Saint in <HI>Germany</HI> as well as in <HI>Flanders:</HI> I speak as to particulars, because as to the general, each People have their <HI>Scaevola,</HI> who had rather Dye a Thousand times than betray their Country.</P>
<P>To come back to my Subject, the Di∣vision began, and the Sickness accomplish'd the ruin of their Army, which coming to want Provisions by the defect of the Ma∣gazines, saw themselves reduc'd to the brink of falling into great extremities.</P>
<P>The Elector himself having felt in his own Person part of the Evils, which be∣gan to afflict his Army, went out of the Camp, and caus'd himself to be carryed, Sick of the Bloody Flux to <HI>Frankfort.</HI> Sometime after I heard of his Death, which made an end of the Expeditions of the Campaign of the <HI>Germans</HI> for the Year 1691.</P>
<P>But, answer'd the King, that does not follow, and does not prove that it will be the same this year. The <HI>Germans</HI> may come
<PB N="96" REF="53"/> again to themselves, make just reflections, and enter into their true Interests; and as they have a mighty Spur, which is the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> and have on the other side from Forty to Fifty Thousand Men; if they should come all of a sudden to pass the <HI>Rhine</HI> and force you, I am perswaded that you would be in a great confusion, having but Ten Thousand Men to oppose them. So that coming to lose a Battle, I should lose the Fairest Flower of my Crown, and my good Fortune, which has promis'd not to quit me but in the Grave, would bid me eternally Farewel. Besides that, the <HI>Turk</HI> my Ally, whom I have till now strove to raise up in his hopes, by the consideration of the Progress that I have made upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> would turn his Back upon me, and making his separate Peace with the Emperour our common Enemy, I should find my self in a very ill con∣dition.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> do not forge unto your self Monsters for fighting them. The Picture that your Majesty now makes of the present State of <HI>Germany,</HI> is nothing less than such. To be fully perswaded therein we need reflect only upon what has been done on that side, since the beginning of the War till now.</P>
<PB N="97" REF="53"/>
<P>Three Campaigns are pass'd without ha∣ving gaind one Inch of Ground upon your Majesty; and if the Deceased Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain,</HI> whom we might have call'd with Justice the <HI>Turenne</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> had not by his Vigilance and his Bravery, stir'd up and animated the Electors to take the Reins in their Hands, and Unite all toge∣ther, to raise again the Glory of the Em∣pire, to work for her preservation, and to set themselves in opposition to the Vio∣lence of the Common Enemy, that same would not have been compassed. So that in the Campaign which was of 1689. we saw them bestir themselves, and minding their business heartily, they form'd the Siege of <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence,</HI> of <HI>Bon</HI> and of <HI>Keisers∣wert,</HI> of which they made themselves Ma∣sters. But this great Zeal which had so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rongly animated them, cool'd by little and little, and was wholly stifled by the Death of him who had first rais'd it. Be∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>des, if your Majesty wishes to have a more sensible proof of what your Enemies are in a condition to undertake on that side; you have only to follow the course of the <HI>Rhi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> in beginning by the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> so to <HI>Coleg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> and then to consider the condition which most of the Members of the Empire
<PB N="98" REF="54"/> have been reduc'd to since the Rupture of the Truce.</P>
<P>Let us begin with the <HI>Palatinate:</HI> I do not think that your Majesty has any thing to fear on that side, since it is only a Me∣lancholy remainder of what escap'd the Fury of the Soldiers, and the Barbarity of the Incendiaries, and by consequence wor∣thier of pity and compassion than to be fear'd.</P>
<P>As for the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> he is a brave Prince, and who might be fear'd if he had Power in his Hands.</P>
<P>Let us go on to the Elector of <HI>Mayence;</HI> neither will he put himself at the Head of the Imperial Army to Command it, be∣cause on the other side it is not his business. I am perswaded that he will be very sorry to have chang'd his Cross for a Marshal's Staff, and he ought long ago to have re∣member'd the Allyance of your Maje∣sty, and to have, more than he did, hear∣ken'd to the <HI>French</HI> Sirens, which ob∣stinacy hath made him become a Prince without Land, an Arch-bishop without a Diocess, and a Shephard without a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lock, and he would have been still in the same condition if the Deceased D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of <HI>Lor∣rain,</HI> and the Allies had not taken up Arms in his Favour, to recover him a part of
<PB N="99" REF="54"/> his Country; as for the rest, the Charge of the War hath Eat it up, and his Coun∣tries have been in so great a desolation, that they have still need of Succour from the Emperor to preserve them; whereup∣on your Majesty has nothing to fear on that side.</P>
<P>Let us speak one word of the Elector of <HI>Treves;</HI> neither is War his business, and his Sword seems to me, never to have done hurt to any body. That does not hinder him to be one of the Bravest Prin∣ces of the Empire, but also one of the most unhappy, by the entire Desolation of his Countries, which have felt the first Fury of the War, and saw themselves ex∣pos'd to the Violence of the Soldiers, the Walls of his Capital City layd even with the Ground, the Castle of his residence Batter'd with Cannon Shot, and <HI>Coblens</HI> overwhelm'd under a Shower of Bombs which have been thrown in at several times.</P>
<P>As for the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> he is so extreamly chang'd since the two first Cam∣paigns, that the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies have no reason to depend upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him, nor upon his Troops, so that you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Majesty has no reason neither to fear any thing from him, or that he for his part will come to trouble your— undertakings.</P>
<PB N="100" REF="55"/>
<P>As to what regards the Electorat of <HI>Co∣logne,</HI> we may put them into the number of those who have greatly suffered, ha∣ving been the Seat of War all the time that the dispute between the Cardinal <HI>de Furestemburgh</HI> and Prince <HI>Joseph Clement</HI> remain'd undecided, and which was at last ended only by force of Arms, which had like to have overturn'd that State, and utterly to have ruin'd it. So that that Diocess will need many years quiet to repair her lost forces and recover her ancient liberty.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, the Prince <HI>Joseph Cle∣ment</HI> is brave, and of whom there is great hopes; but on the other side he is too young to measure his Sword with your Majesty; so you have no occasion to fear any thing from that Quarter. From the Borders of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> let us go a little farther into the Country, and see if there is some new <HI>Caesar</HI> which could carry the Glory of <HI>Germany</HI> so far, as did formerly that great Captain of the <HI>Romans;</HI> I would say a Prince a little resolv'd, who should come and put himself at the Head of the <HI>Germans,</HI> to serve them for a Sting, and animate them by his presence.</P>
<P>I only see the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> who succeeds to that Electorship, vacant by
<PB N="101" REF="55"/> the Death of the Elector his Father, and who seems to be engag'd to follow the Interest of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> by reason of the ailyance of the Princess of <HI>Anspach</HI> his Cousin, whom he has lately Married. But as he is a new Married Man, he will be glad to enjoy during the Summer the first sweetness of his Mar∣riage, giving nevertheless the Com∣mand of his Troops to Monsieur <HI>Schoning</HI> our good Friend, heretofore in the ser∣vice of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and at present happily received and accepted General of the Troops of <HI>Saxony,</HI> so that your Majesty has no more need to fear any thing on that side: One Countermarch may be of great use.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, you say nothing of the Electors of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> nor of the Princes of the Houses of <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over,</HI> who are notwithstanding the Right Hand of all <HI>Germany,</HI> and who may when they think fit Form a Party to ballance all the Power of the Emperour, and of the other less potent Princes of the Empire.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> I do not pre∣tend to talk off the Electors of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and <HI>Bavaria;</HI> and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch less of the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> because these Princes having a greater share in supporting the War of
<PB N="102" REF="56"/> <HI>Flanders</HI> than that of <HI>Germany,</HI> since they have the greatest part of their Troops in that Country, and that according to my judgment, they are resolv'd to make ve∣ry great efforts, I leave the care to Mon∣sieur <HI>de Luxemburgh</HI> to discourse it throughly, being resolv'd to meddle with nothing but the affairs of the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>But if your Majesty desires I should speak a word by the way, I will obey you wil∣lingly, and add to what has been said of the Princes of the Empire, that to what relates to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> we do not doubt but he is brave in his Person, and perhaps one of the greatest Princes, that the Empire has yet produc'd; he hath gi∣ven signal marks in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where he has done for his Age, Actions worthy to be put in Paralell with what the boldest and most glorious Captains have done; I add to all that, that the Campaign of 1689. in which he Commanded with the late Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Army of the Confederates upon the <HI>Rhine;</HI> the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> to whom your Majesty had gi∣ven the Command in Chief of your Army, had all the trouble imaginable, and was oblig'd to make use of all the tricks of War, to avoid a Battle; whilst that his Brother-in-Law the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="56"/> made on his side great Marches, and forc'd all that oppos'd his passage to come to engage; so far it is true that Hatred be∣comes more and more irreconcileable when it is born amongst Relations or Friends. But the failing of Generals, by the Death of two of the greatest Captains of the Age, <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Schomberg,</HI> and the pressing necessities that the Allies found themselves in, by the progress that your Arms had made in <HI>Flanders, Savoy, Cata∣lonia,</HI> and upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> was the cause that he went to Command in <HI>Italy,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he actu∣ally is.</P>
<P>It were only to be wish'd by them, that his Electoral Highness would use a little more Circumspection in the choice he makes of his Domesticks, and principally of his Musicians, who wriggle themselves into his Chappel, in the Habit of a Priest or Monk, not to say of a Fox, for no∣thing but to see what passes, and discover to his Enemies his most secret underta∣kings; which is the greatest misfortune that can happen to a General; and that he ought to endeavour to avoid as a plague capable to spoil all he does, to ruin his reputation, to make him unhappy, and baffle all his great designs.</P>
<PB N="104" REF="57"/>
<P>But it is an Universal Malady amongst all the Allies; and there are very few of their Generals, who have yet found the secret to preserve themselves; and this is just the defect of their Breast-Plate, and by which your Majesty carries even into the Heart your most formidable Blows, and that all the <HI>French</HI> Generals look up∣on at this day, as the Seed of the Lawrels and Victories they have heap'd up one upon another. Your <HI>Majesty</HI> may con∣clude from all that I have reported of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> that this Prince will be for the future so strongly employ'd in other places that I do not think we shall see him any more at the Head of the Ar∣mies of the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>But the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> says his Majesty, could not he come in Person, for by what I can learn he is to make the Campaign, without being able to under∣stand where he is to Command.</P>
<P>Sir, answered <HI>de Lorge,</HI> I have told your Majesty, and I'le repeat it again, that all these considerations ought not to stop the course of your Enterprizes. The Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> has to streight En∣gagements with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to leave <HI>Brabant.</HI></P>
<P>These two Princes are inseparable, and
<PB N="105" REF="57"/> will always hold together Mutually to maintain their Interests: It is not necessary I should enlarge thereupon, nor that I should search Proofs at a distance; the Catastrophe th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t happen'd in <HI>England,</HI> furnishes a convincing Argument, and we may say, that this was the only Ele∣ctor amongst all the Members of the Em∣pire to whom the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had open'd his Heart, and put confidence in.</P>
<P>So the Elector on his side favour'd his design as well by his Troops, as by the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hal <HI>de Schomberg,</HI> whom he off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d him with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l freedom of Heart.</P>
<P>So in <HI>Flanders,</HI> since the beginning of the War till now, and also during the time the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> labour'd in <HI>Ireland</HI> for the reduction of that Kingdom, the Ele∣ctor made it his chief Study to Act joyntly with Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> and we never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve seen him come back again to the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e,</HI> to quit the Command of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Troops which are almost all in the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vice of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces.</HI></P>
<P>I add also here, that I am perswaded that your Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty has lost mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by the Death of the late Elector his Father, if you consider the free access, and the li∣berty that he gave to your Ministers,
<PB N="106" REF="58"/> who had thereby the occasion to enter into the Cabinet of that Prince, to collect his most secret Thoughts; Monsieur <HI>de Rebenack</HI> knows it better than any one; but now it is no more so.</P>
<P>The death of the late Electrice has al∣so depriv'd you of a good part of your best Intelligences, so that to renew them in this Court, you must implore the as∣sistance of St. <HI>Louis,</HI> and bestow behind the Curtain a good number of Pistols, af∣ter which your Majesty will be Master of the Secrets there, as you are in all other places.</P>
<P>But, answer'd his Majesty, as to matter of Intelligence, I just now learn'd with a great deal of regret, and also with some kind of trouble, that the poor General <HI>Schoning</HI> was arrested by order of the Emperor, and carry'd to <HI>Spielberg</HI> in <HI>Mo∣ravia</HI> where he is Condemned to a perpe∣tual prison. That troubles me so much the more, because I lose in him one of the most faithful Correspondents that I had in all <HI>Germany,</HI> and in one word a second <HI>Fustemberg.</HI></P>
<P>I shall never forget the Obligation I have to him, and the Siege of <HI>Bon,</HI> where he found the Means to make it hold out five whole Months after it was Bombar∣ded
<PB N="107" REF="58"/> which was of great help to me, to a∣muse the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> the whole Campaign.</P>
<P>If the good Man had been believ'd o∣ther Affairs would have fallen'n well out.</P>
<P>Sir, your Majesty will never fail of Spies, if you do but largely reward them. Money has charms whose Brightness dazle a Man's Reason, and makes all things to be undertaken; and if your Enemies had this secret, your Majesty would not reck∣on so many Victories nor Conquests: But their parcimony has serv'd more to bring your Majesty to the Period whither you are at present come, than your great and numerous Armies.</P>
<P>A Secret Bought is worth a Battle won, and a Governour corrupted is worth the Conquest of an Important City. So I ad∣vise you to keep your self alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the Trunk of a Tree, in following step by step the Tracts of <HI>Richiieu</HI> and <HI>Mazarine,</HI> who have so worthily instructed you, in tracing their ways to come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the end of your undertakings, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> come at last to the Universal Monarc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Cent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of all your Glori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings.</P>
<P>As to the matter of Monarchy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d his Majesty, say what you t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nk of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e
<PB N="108" REF="59"/> Princes of the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and let us make an end of talking of the Affairs of <HI>Germany,</HI> with the Chief of the Em∣pire.</P>
<P>As to what regards, says <HI>de Lorge,</HI> the Princes of the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> your Majesty has had even to this time no rea∣son to complain of their Hostili∣ties.</P>
<P>They love Tranquility too well, to fear they should come to put themselves at the Head of the <HI>Germans,</HI> to pass the <HI>Rhine</HI> Headlong, and for the Glory of the Nation hazard a Battle. As to their Troops which are the finest of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> has found the means to engage them in his service, in making the Emperour agree, that the Eldest Duke of the Family should augment the number of Electors, and that he should be receiv'd into the Electoral Colledge. Which shews that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is look'd upon at present, as the Star that Governs in the World, and that he has only to desire in order to obtain.</P>
<P>Prerogatives of a Prince, which he hath acquired, without thinking of the Uni∣versal Monarchy, to which your Majesty has aspir'd, since so many years, and for which you have so mercilesly caus'd so
<PB N="109" REF="59"/> much Blood to be spilt, and so many States, and Provinces to be overthrown, and so many People to be ruin'd, whilst this Prince Arrives by the way of Sweet∣ness and complacency— and by gai∣ning the Friendship of the People, who regard him already as their De∣liverer, and another <HI>Joshua,</HI> rea∣dy to stop the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> Sun in the midst of his course</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you, says his Majesty, that my Agent <HI>Bidal</HI> has let me know that the Landgrave of <HI>Hesse, Cassel,</HI> and the Margrave <HI>de Bareith</HI> are to Command the Armies of the Confederates upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> so you will have occasion of a great deal of management; I recommend to to you above all to avoid a Battle.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>de Lorge,</HI> rest satisfied there∣upon, if they are two, I have the secret in Hand to divide them, and I promise my self before-hand with my small num∣ber a glorious Campaign.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, do you know well the Landgrave <HI>de Hessel Cassel?</HI> do you know that he and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> are two Heads in one Cap, that he is brave in his Person, and that he is to be fear'd?</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> yes if he was a∣lone,
<PB N="110" REF="60"/> but it is sufficient they are two to Command, and by consequence two Heads, of which each will have his Counsellors; rest satisfied that I will accomplish it, <HI>alios vidimus ventos,</HI> says <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>We have seen other Outrages and Tem∣pests, and it is no new thing that we fight against two Chiefs. We do not see Pru∣dence and Wisdom divided and parted, in all the parts of Human Body, but shee resides, and has her principal Seat in the Brain of a Man.</P>
<P>A Body which should have two Souls, would be depriv'd of this agreeable Harmo∣ny which produces health, and which causes all the parts that compose it to Act in or∣der. It is the same with an Army, which is Commanded by two Generals. It is impossible they should be free from divi∣sion, which is more pernicious than the loss of Battles.</P>
<P>Besides <HI>de Lorge,</HI> says his Majesty, if the Emperour <HI>Leopold</HI> stirr'd up by my Ex∣ample, or by Imitation of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em∣perours, his Predecessors, should of a sud∣den take the resolution to come himself at the Head of the Army upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> to govern it, and see what passes there, I must own I should be in a great deal of trouble upon this account, and that you
<PB N="111" REF="60"/> would be in no less than I, because I am perswaded that the presence of a Prince, who shews and exposes himself to danger in sight of his Soldiers, and of his Gene∣rals, is a mighty Example. If the <HI>Otto∣man</HI> Emperour my Allie, would have be∣liev'd me, and have hearken'd to my Am∣bassadour the Baron <HI>de Chasteau Neuf,</HI> he would have come in Person to have put himself at the Head of his Armies in <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> I doubt not but he would thereby have preserv'd all his Conquests, carryed the dread for the second time to the Gates of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and sav'd many Battles, lost by the fault of his <HI>Viziers.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, answer'd the Duke <HI>de Lorge,</HI> the Emperour <HI>Leopold</HI> and his Nephew <HI>Charles</HI> the II. King of <HI>Spain</HI> are not so Ambi∣tious as your Majesty. These are two good Princes, who seek only Repose and Peace, and shun the Cruelties of the War. And if your Majesty had not constrain'd them to take up Arms to maintain their Interests, and those of all <HI>Europe,</HI> they would not have troubled themselves at this time to go and gather Lawrels in the Field of <HI>Mars;</HI> this God doth not Sym∣pathize with those Princes; <HI>Apollo</HI> has ma∣ny other Charms, and Mount <HI>Parnassus</HI> other Enchantments. Formerly <HI>Orpheus</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="61"/> by the sweetness of Instruments drew to him all the Beasts; and also the insensible Creatures, the Rocks and the Woods could not defend themselves from his at∣tractive Harmony. It is true, that if <HI>Char∣lemaigne, Charles</HI> the V. and <HI>Phillip</HI> the II. should come from the other World, this reproach would without doubt be made them. But every Prince has his Passions, his Inclinations, and his Weaknesses; your Majesty loves War, the late King <HI>Charls</HI> the II. King of <HI>England</HI> lov'd the fair Sex, and your Majesty took care to make him a Present of Mistresses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor loves a Harmony; make him a Present of Musicians, and they will take care to inform you of all that passes at the Court of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>I understand also Sir, that the Electors at present, for the most part, Study the Inclinations of their Prince, and strive to imitate him in all things, which is the reason they are all almost lovers of Mu∣sick. So there remains no more for your Majesty to do, than to make a provision of Musicians, (<HI>Brabant</HI> above all abounds of such) and send them into all the Courts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and this will be a Sovereign remedy to know and discover all.</P>
<P>What I have just now said furnishes me
<PB N="113" REF="61"/> yet with one thought, which is, that it is not to be wonder'd at (as a politick <HI>Spaniard</HI> did once very judiciously say) that your Majesty has surpas'd <HI>Henry</HI> the IV. <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIII. and in a word all your predeces∣sors, by a great number of events, which have happn'd during your Reign, and which are solely owing to the Wisdom, and to the good fortune of your Majesty, since we see that the Imbecility of Prin∣ces, who have Reign'd in your time, have as much, and also more contributed there∣unto. If you had had for Competitors, Queen <HI>Elizabeth, Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> the V. which would have disputed the Ground with you; as you had <HI>Charles</HI> the II. and <HI>James</HI> the II. Kings of <HI>England</HI> the Emperour <HI>Leopold,</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> the II. King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who have let you under∣take any thing, I am perswaded you would not have got so many Victories. But this is the unhappy condition of States. The downfal of one is the rise of the other. I say also farther; if it should happen, by way of fatality, as we may say, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was not met with in your Reign, and also that being met with, he had not been animated with another Zeal than the rest of the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> for the defence of their Coun∣tries,
<PB N="114" REF="62"/> and the preservation of their Li∣berties, all would long since have fallen under the weight of your Arms, and your Majesty would have finished the great Work of the Universal Monar∣chy.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, what do you hear of the Negotiation of the Peace between the two Empires? Monsieur <HI>Harbord</HI> En∣voy of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> has he been well receiv'd by the <HI>Grand Vizier?</HI> I know the enterview was to be at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> what have you learnt, and what are your thoughts thereupon? Do you believe that he will succeed better than Pensionary <HI>Hop</HI> and the Knight <HI>Hussey</HI> have done be∣fore?</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> I know from good Hands that the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> wi∣shes for a Peace, and that the People will have it at any rate; so your Majesty has no more time to lose, and there wants but one moment to conclude it, and to recon∣cile these two Powers. The <HI>French</HI> Si∣rens who are at the Court of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> begin to loose a little of the Charms of their Singing and their Melo∣dy, as well as their credit. The <HI>Louis d' Ors</HI> are so strongly cry'd down at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that no Body will have a∣ny
<PB N="115" REF="62"/> more to do with them.</P>
<P>I advise then your Majesty to push on your great designs; the time presses, prevent your Enemy in the Field; your Majesty being at the Head of a flourishing Army, may go fall on where you think fit, and carry one of the strongest places of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>I advise you again to make your last efforts, to come to a Peace, an to hin∣der the conclusion of the Truce between the two Emperours, and if Mony is not capable to hinder it, to employ yet more Sovereign remedies, the Se∣crets of<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>Harbord</HI> poysoned.</NOTE> <HI>Brinvilliers</HI> in the Hands of a <HI>French</HI> Cook are infallible.</P>
<P>As soon as the Mareschal <HI>de Lorge,</HI> was gone out of the Chamber, the King or∣der'd that the Count <HI>de Tourville</HI> and <HI>John Barts</HI> should come in.</P>
<P><HI>Tourville,</HI> saies his Majesty, I have two great designs in hand, and I have chose you to execute the one, whilst I am going to execute the other at the Head of an Army, of one Hundred and Fifty Thou∣sand Men. There is no time to lose, the occasion is pressing, and the resolution is taken.</P>
<P>First, I propose to my self to re-establish
<PB N="116" REF="63"/> King <HI>James</HI> upon the Throne of <HI>England:</HI> And in the second place to constrain my Enemies, who have flatter'd themselves to stop the Course of my Conquests, to ask for a Peace.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Tourville,</HI> nothing is impossi∣ble for your Majesty; you have a formida∣ble Fleet which makes you Master of the Sea, &amp; which obliges your Enemies to yield you that Empire, for which so many Na∣tions have spilt their Blood.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> boasted them∣selves till now to possess it, but the glori∣ous Fight of 1690. has decided it to the advantage of your Majesty, so you are in a condition to undertake all that you please on that side. By Land your Maje∣sty is no less formidable, you have great and Valiant Armies, always ready for the execution of your vast undertakings; you have able Generals to Command them, who Work for nothing but the Glory of their Prince; and which is more, you have the Philosopher's Stone in your Hand, that is to say, the secret to draw from your Subjects what Mony you please, which renders you formidable to all <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and makes you always Trium∣phant.</P>
<P>That's not the matter in hand, says his
<PB N="117" REF="63"/> Majesty, I well know that I am fear'd, by my Enemies; but by land I have more reason to trust to the good fortune of my Arms than by Sea. The <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> seem to me yet to be fear'd, if a good understanding should once come to Reign amongst them.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Tourville,</HI> if your Majesty takes the pains to run over the History of your Reign, you will see many Victories that your Admirals have gain'd upon the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who are also yet as much to be fear'd as the <HI>English;</HI> because besides the method they have of blowing up them∣selves rather than submit, they also other∣wise fight like mad-men. But let it be as it will, there has been several Fights du∣ring this reign, the chiefest of which was that of <HI>Tobago,</HI> where the Mareschal <HI>d' Estre</HI> Sunk almost all the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet; there have been also many others that Mon∣sieur <HI>du Quesne</HI> had upon the Coasts of <HI>Sicily,</HI> in one of which the famous <HI>Ruyter,</HI> Admiral of <HI>Holland,</HI> was kill'd, which was a very sensible and irreparable loss for that Republick, and which she felt many years after. In another Fight all the Enemies Fleet was burnt under the Canon of <HI>Palermo.</HI></P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, all those times are
<PB N="118" REF="64"/> past, and experience has shewn me in the year 1690. when you fought against the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> which were in all but Twenty Four great Men of War, whereas you had Eighty Five, that you had nevertheless a great deal of trouble with that great number to draw your self off from the En∣gagement; and I do not know whether my Fleet was more damag'd than theirs; since you brought no other mark of Vi∣ctory, than that of carrying back to <HI>Brest</HI> my Ships much disabled without having taken from the Enemies one simple Cha∣loop.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Tourville,</HI> I vow to your Ma∣jesty, that my surprize was great to see so small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> number resist and fight against a Fleet whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h we had reason to take for Invincible, and I much doubt if that of <HI>Philip</HI> the II. which was so called when she went to the Conquest of three King∣doms, was so Fine, so Formidable, and so Numerous in great Ships of War.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, Sir, generally all the Fleet of your Majesty, fought against this small number, Monsieur <HI>de Gabaret</HI> had like to have been taken off with a Canon Bullet, and had more than Two Hundred kill'd aboard. Monsieur <HI>de Nesmo d</HI> did wonderfully well, but his Ship <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as so
<PB N="119" REF="64"/> maul'd, that we had a great deal of trou∣ble to carry her off. Monsieur the Count <HI>d' Estre</HI> was Wounded in the Leg by a Splinter, and had a great number kill'd and wounded aboard. The Marquess <HI>de la Porte</HI> came off at no cheaper a rate than the Count <HI>d' Estre,</HI> and his Ship was greatly damaged.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Vallette</HI> was obliged to Change his Ship, so much had she been shot through and through; he had above half his Equipage kill'd without reckoning the wounded. In short, Sir, what I Re∣port here to your Majesty is but an abridg∣ment of the losses we had, and I content my self to speak of the Admirals and Chiefs of Squadrons, passing over in si∣lence a great number of Officers of less considerable Ships. But as to the rest your Majesty had the glory of the Fight and the Victory on your side.</P>
<P>But that is not all, says his Majesty, you will have a stronger Enemy to fight with this Campaign, than the former, if I may believe my Spies in <HI>Holland,</HI> and chiefly at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> who have let me know posi∣tively, that that Republick has resolv'd to put to Sea for her <HI>quota,</HI> a Fleet of Forty five great Ships, which being joyn'd to Fifty that the <HI>English</HI> will furnish, will
<PB N="120" REF="65"/> make a very potent Fleet; so I have rea∣son to presage quite another Event, and if it should happen by misfortune that you should be beaten you will ruin all my undertakings.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Tourville,</HI> if the <HI>English</HI> are on∣ly lookers on, as there is all appearance, I have the Victory in my Pocket.</P>
<P>But do you know well, says his Majesty, that the <HI>Holl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nders</HI> alone are almost as strong in number as you will be?</P>
<P>Sir, it is no matter, says <HI>Tourville,</HI> the Naval Army of your Majesty, if actu∣ally of Forty Four great Ships, without reckoning the Six, which are yet at <HI>Dun∣kirk,</HI> and the fourteen th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Count <HI>d' Estre</HI> brings from <HI>Toulon,</HI> the which joyn'd together, will make a Fleet more than sufficient to beat the Enemy, tho' the two Nations together should fight their best. I suppose also the advantage, that if it should happen by a misfortune, or by contrary Winds, that Monsieur <HI>d' Estre</HI> was not in a condition to joyn me, Sir I engage at the Peril of my Life, to go and attack them with the Forty Four which composes the main of the Fleet, and which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more, to come back Glorious and Triumphant.</P>
<P><HI>Tourville,</HI> says his Majesty, have a care,
<PB N="121" REF="65"/> who reckons without his Enemy reckons twice; <HI>Mazarine</HI> always told me, in my Youth, That Fore∣sight and Wisdom made the first degree of the For∣tune of the great ones; and that a Prince who did not foresee the Misfortunes which might happen to him, was not worthy to Reign. So I have always so strongly strove to follow the Maxims of that good Man, that I would never hazard any thing; and I have found my self very well satisfied with it. So I have order'd all my Generals, upon pain of Death, not to hazard a Battle, unless they were assured of the Victory.</P>
<P>To make short then, <HI>Tourville,</HI> free you seem to have Courage enough, here is the order you must keep in attacking my Enemies.</P>
<P>Having ranged my Fleet in Batalia, you must go streight upon them, and you must Post your self op∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>te and in presence of the <HI>Englis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> after having <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>g up the red Flag, you must salute A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>miral <HI>Rus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el</HI> very civilly with two broad-s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s of Canon, only with Powder, and without Ball: after this Salvo, and one moment after, you must make Sign to all my Fleet to do the same, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that with Pow∣de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in imitating you▪ this C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>remony being done, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>u will know immed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately if A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>miral <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l</HI> en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the Matter.

I recommend to you, above all, to be I exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble,
<PB N="122" REF="66"/> and to destroy without Pity and without Mercy, my Enemies, to exterminate them, and to act so that not one escape.</P>
<P><HI>Tourville,</HI> call to your remembrance the Fight of 1690. and see that that happens no more to you, to let the <HI>Hollanders</HI> retire, without taking one un∣happy Bark from them.</P>
<P>Whilst you shall be engag'd, King <HI>James</HI> shall be upon the Coast to judge of the Blows, waiting for the Event; and the Descent into <HI>England</HI> will follow immediately after, and all that without losing time.</P>
<P>The King ask'd for <HI>John Barts,</HI> who was retir'd out of the way: <HI>John Barts</HI> seeing his Majesty de∣sir'd to speak with him, answered Sir, I am here.</P>
<P><HI>John Barts,</HI> says his Majesty, how go the Prizes? Do you take many of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders?</HI> For by what I can learn, these two Nations fear you.</P>
<P>Sir, answered <HI>John Barts,</HI> I have resolv'd, saving your Majesty's good pleasure, to carry the <HI>French</HI> Piracy to so high a degree, that all the Capers of <HI>France</HI> shall have reason to call me their Father, their Patron and their Restorer; and, finally, after my death, those of S. <HI>Malo</HI> and <HI>Dunkirk</HI> shall can∣nonize me in Memory of my great Actions, and my name plac'd in the Kalendar, shall be named, <HI>The Feast of</HI> John Barts <HI>the holy Thief.</HI></P>
<P>In short, I hope, by the help of the Almighty, to out-do quickly, by my Tricks and my good Prizes, all that has been formerly most boldly done by the <HI>Mezomortes</HI> and those of <HI>Tripoly.</HI></P>
<P>But, answer'd his Majesty, if it should happen that you should fall into the Hands of your Enemies, I am persuaded that they would make you pass your time very ill.</P>
<PB N="123" REF="66"/>
<P>Sir, says <HI>John Barts,</HI> I fear nothing so much as the <HI>Zealand</HI> Capers, formerly my joint Brothers, and at present my mortal Enemies, because they are so angry that I have betray'd my Country and their Party, to embrace that of your Majesty's, that they will call me in their Language, <HI>Ʋrede Breeker,</HI> Breaker of the Peace, that they would never par∣don me; besides, they cannot indure that I should surpass them in Malice, and that I should teach the <HI>French</HI> their Art, of which they are jealous even to the last degree.</P>
<P><HI>John Barts,</HI> says his Majesty, this is not all; I have two great Designs in hand, the one in <HI>Flanders</HI> and the other in <HI>England,</HI> and I see my self just upon the point of Execution, and to make it succeed, I shall have occasion for all my Forces by Sea and Land; so it is, and for that end I have call'd toge∣ther all my Generals to take their Advice, and con∣duct this Enterprize with all the Prudence imagi∣nable. My design is, then, to go into <HI>Flanders,</HI> at the Head of an Army of 150000 Men, and to form the Siege of the strongest place of <HI>Europe;</HI> whilst I shall be busy in the execution of it, you must get together all my Capers and form a Fleet, of which I make you, from this time, Admiral, in conside∣ration of your good Services; and you must act on one side, whilst the Count <HI>de Tourville</HI> shall act on the other, according to the Orders I have given him; and you must make your Movements and your Courses, with your flying Camp of Pirates, being well settled in Concert and Intelligence with <HI>Tourville:</HI> As to the rest, I recommend to you the Secret.</P>
<P>Assoon as the Count <HI>de Tourville</HI> and <HI>John Barts</HI> were gone out, his Majesty order d, That Monsieur <HI>de Pompone</HI> should come.</P>
<PB N="124" REF="67"/>
<P><HI>Pompone,</HI> says the King, I recommend to you my Kingdom, I am just upon my departure, the Reso∣lutions are taken, and I am to be in <HI>Flanders</HI> at the Head of 150000 Men; so I leave you the Reins of Government, during my absence. You are the wisest of my Ministers, and after the death of poor <HI>Louvois,</HI> I knew not how to make choice of a wor∣thier Subject than you. Father <HI>La Chaize,</HI> my Con∣fessor, is not contented; and the old Quarrels that these good Fathers have had, with your Uncle Mon∣sieur <HI>Arnaud,</HI> run still in their Heads.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Pompone,</HI> the <HI>Jansenists</HI> will always flou∣rish in your Kingdom in spight of the Reverend Fa∣thers of the Society, and of their violent Prejudices against them. I know what I have suffered upon their account, having try'd many Storms, which had made me resolve upon a voluntary Banishment, in retireing into the Country, to be secure from their Persecution and their Rage; Monsieur <HI>de Louvois</HI> neither was none of my best Friends; he had too much correspondence with Father <HI>la Chaize,</HI> not to join Forces and attempt my Ruin every way he could; but without ransaking the Ashes of the dead, I rejoyce to see my Innocence applauded by the confidence your Majesty reposes in me concerning the Affairs of your Kingdom.</P>
<P>As you have been, says his Majesty, in Ambassy in <HI>Holland,</HI> and that you know perfectly the Genius and Interest of that Republick, I have but one word to say to you, to make you apprehend imme∣diately what is my end, in going to the Head of my Armies; it is one Home-push for the Game, and the only one to come to a Peace; <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> made me see it as clear as the day.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Pompone,</HI> it is high time for your Maje∣sty to begin to set bounds to your Ambition, and that you cherish your People; the whole Kingdom
<PB N="125" REF="67"/> is oppress'd, and groans under the heavy Burden of Imposts and Subsidies, and therefore 'tis dangerous for so great a Prince as you, to expose himself too much.</P>
<P>If the Presence of your Majesty is necessary in your Army, it is no less so in your Kingdom, where you support your Power and Sovereignty, and dis∣sipate the Plots of the Malecontents; which keeps Prosperity among your People, and preserves the Harmony that is necessary between him that com∣mands and those that obey.</P>
<P>We have experienc'd in all Ages past, that those Kings who have staid at home in their Closets have executed greater things, than those have done, whom Ambition and an insatiable desire of Glory have carried even to the extremities of the World. <HI>Charles</HI> V. and <HI>Louis</HI> XI. have atchiev'd greater Exploits, without going out of their Palace, than did <HI>Louis</HI> the Young and <HI>Philip</HI> the August, in pas∣sing the Seas, and in carrying their Arms into <HI>Africa;</HI> we still feel the smart of what was occasi∣oned in <HI>France,</HI> by the Imprisonment of St. <HI>Louis,</HI> of King <HI>John,</HI> and of <HI>Francis</HI> I. Sir, these are Wounds to the State, and irreparable Losses when they happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</P>
<P><HI>Pompone,</HI> says his Majesty, the Resolution is taken, and the Dice is thrown; this Campaign will be no more dangerous for my Person, than that of <HI>Mons</HI> was, and so many others that I have made in my Reign; Fortune cherishes me too much, to leave me now I am in so fair a Career.</P>
<P>A King is never Great nor Illustrious, who has not carried his Arms among Strangers to make them know his Strength, and to make them feel the sweetness and equity of his Commands. I had all my Life an aversion for those slothful Kings of the first Race, who did not govern their Countries, but
<PB N="126" REF="68"/> suffer'd themselves to be govern'd by the Grandees; nothing is more pernicious to a Prince, than Luxury and too much Repose. <HI>Nero,</HI> whose first years were so admirable and so great, eclips'd the lustre of them by his Debau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes and his Cruelties, which were but the fatal consequence or Idleness.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Pompone,</HI> if your Majesty has so conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uded, and that you think it fit, for the way to a Peace, I wish you all Prosperity and a happy Campaign.</P>
<P>The time of my departure draws near, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his Majesty; I recommend to you, above all, to have an Eye upon the <HI>new Catholicks,</HI> whom I look upon, in my Absence, as Enemies most to be fear'd. You know what care I have taken to bring them back to the bosom of the Church, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how I have b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en forc'd to use them, to pluck up this cursed Tare which has mix'd it self with the good Corn.</P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Pomp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne,</HI> I do not know, if your Majesty had all the reason in the World to deliver them so merciles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to the resentment of their Ene∣mies; for my pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ticular, I felt a part of their Mis∣fortunes, and Father <HI>la Chaiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> gave me no better Quarters than them.</P>
<P>Your Illustrious Predecess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, witness the Grand∣father of your Majesty, <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n y</HI> IV. came to the Crown only by their a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sistance.

<P>I recommend to you also the three young Princes, my Grand-children; entertain them, above all, with the great Actions of their Grand-father; I re∣commend to you chiefly the Eldest, the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> whom I us'd to call the Prince of <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de;</HI> because that truly we see, as it were reb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m all the shining Qualities of that Prince.</P>
<P>I recommend to you, in short, all the Intelli∣gences that I have in Foreign Courts, have a care of them: receive the Letters that shall be writ to me, and cause the Sums design'd for the Pensions I pay them, to be return'd. I also very carefully re∣commend to you my Treasury; assist <HI>Ponchart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aine</HI> with your good Advice, and lend him your Hand in working jointly for settling a Fund for the next Campaign.</P>

<P>Sir, says <HI>Pompone,</HI> they report of <HI>Dag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bert,</HI> that he was so j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st and free towards the Churches, That
<PB N="128" REF="69"/> he caus'd the Church of St. <HI>Dennis</HI> to be covered with Silver. But your Majesty makes another use of Mony, you have a quite different Pity and Ju∣stice from that Prince. You imitate rather him, who finding the 12 Apostles of Massy Silver in a Church, caus'd them to be taken from the Altar; and having made them into Mony, told them, That they should go Preach, throughout the whole World, according to the order that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> had given them.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Pompone</HI> being gone out, the King or∣der'd, that Messieurs <HI>de Barbesieux</HI> and <HI>de Chanlais</HI> should come in in all haste.</P>
<P><HI>Barbesieux,</HI> says his Majesty, the Resolutions are taken; I have a great Design in hand: Silence, we are now at the point to bring great things to Light; the Campaign of <HI>Mons</HI> had nothing like it.</P>
<P>Ha! what then! Sir, says <HI>Barbesieux.</HI></P>
<P>I am a going, says his Majesty, into <HI>Flanders,</HI> at the Head of an Army of 150000 Men, to form the Siege of the Key of all the Low Countries.: <HI>Lux∣emburgh</HI> has shou'd it me as clear as the Sun at Noon.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Chanlais,</HI> your Majesty must make haste, for I hear that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> will come a Month sooner into the Field than he did last year.</P>
<P>It is no matter, says his Majesty, I shall have near 80000 Men more than he, and I shall be co∣vered by three potent Armies; besides, I will make <HI>Boufflers</HI> go before and possess himself of the Passages. <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> has assur'd me, that I have no more cause to fear, than if I were at <HI>Versailles.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, answer'd <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> if that be so, your Ma∣jesty will have a good Bargain for all you shall un∣dertake, whilst that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> fatigues and exposes himself to the most eminent Dangers.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Chanlais,</HI> Gold and Treason are at this day two great double Keys to your Majesty; be∣sides,
<PB N="129" REF="69"/> that they open all Gates, they operate more in a moment than great Armies do in a Summer's Ex∣pedition.</P>
<P>Both the one and the other must be had, says his Majesty; I have found out the means to tame the Lion and the Fox, which were heretofore incom∣patible, and I only march now to take Possession of what I have bought before.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> that is not all; your Majesty must seek the shortest way to come quickly to a Peace; the want of every thing is a dangerous Di∣sease, which begins to be felt throughout your Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Barbesieux,</HI> you speak home, says his Majesty, and all the advantage I propose to my self, by this Ex∣pedition, is to come to the way of a Peace.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> I have yet a shorter way, and more abridg'd than that, to come to a Peace.</P>
<P>Ha! what? says his Majesty.</P>
<P>It is to put in execution the Project that my de∣ceased Father, the Marquiss <HI>de Louvois,</HI> had begun the rough draught of, and which he left in his Cabi∣net after his death; that is, the White that is the Center whereto all your Majesty's Enterprizes should tend.</P>
<P>What must be done then, says his Majesty?</P>
<P>Sir, the Business in hand, is to send the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> Chief of the League, <HI>ad Patres,</HI> if your Ma∣jesty will consent to it. It is he that sits at the Helm, and is the chiefest Promoter of this War, who draws by his Rapidity, the Princes and the Circles of the Empire, as well as the other States at present in War with your Majesty.</P>
<P>Sir, added <HI>Chanlais,</HI> thereby King <HI>James</HI> will re∣mount his Throne immediately, and your Majesty will impose what Laws you please to the Allies, who then would see themselves without a Head, and
<PB N="130" REF="70"/> would be like a Flock without a Shepherd. The Dogs of <HI>England</HI> coming to fail, the Wolf would enter into the Park, sacrificing all to her rage, without Pity and without Mercy.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, how can that be? Such an Undertaking gives me Horror.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> that's not the matter in hand; your Majesty is in the Mire, as we say, you must draw your self out of it cost what it will.</P>
<P>But good God, says his Majesty, if the World should come to know that I had consented to so black an Attempt, what would they say of me?</P>
<P>When I shall have throughly acquainted your Majesty, says <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> with the Importance of the Project and the easiness of the Execution, we will look out for Remedies to cure the niceness of your Conscience.</P>
<P>What is your Opinion of it, then, says his Ma∣jesty?</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> I have two profligate Men ready, <HI>Grandvall</HI> and <HI>Dumont,</HI> who shall be the Un∣dertakers of this glorious Tragedy; I will charge my self with the Event, and will answer for the Success.</P>
<P>Ho! ho! says his Majesty, you have then your People ready.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> the late Marquiss <HI>de Louvois,</HI> my Father, has been so happy as to do your Majesty some considerable Services, during your Reign, and he would have added this to the rest of his good Deeds, if Death had not cut him off; but having snatch'd him out of the World, when he thought the least of it, he charg'd me, as his worthy Son, to proceed to the execution of his last Will, and to be Assistant to this great Work.</P>
<P>Ha, ha, says his Majesty, <HI>Louvois</HI> had then under∣taken it, had he? I should never have thought that of him.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="70"/>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> is your Majesty ignorant then, that the death of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and now of late, the Knight <HI>Harboard,</HI> hath been pro∣cured by our means, with the help of a little Poy∣son? We have brought the Affairs of the War on the <HI>Rhine</HI> into a good Posture, and caus'd, on a sud∣den, all the Propositions of Peace to vanish, that the <HI>Turk,</HI> your Ally, made to the Emperor. No Sir, that your Majesty may not flatter your self, you owe all to Poyson, to Mony and to Treason; and if you had not on your side these great and mighty Springs, you would never with all your numerous Armies, have pushed on your Frontiers so far.</P>
<P>Let us speak softly, says his Majesty, for fear some of my Enemies should be here; I would not for a hundred such Crowns as I wear, this should come to the Ears of the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, added <HI>Chanlais,</HI> your Majesty must know, That there is no Prince in the World who marches with more freedom and simplicity, than the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> He exposes himself to Danger without troubling himself about the Event; Predestination alone rules his Motions; and we do not see him as your Majesty, an Idolator of his Person nor of his Preservation: He is wont to say, That which God guards is well guarded. So, Sir, your Majesty needs only give your consent to the Undertakings, and we warrant the rest.</P>
<P>But, says his Majesty, methinks <HI>Grandvall</HI> and <HI>Dumont</HI> are not sufficient for so great a Design, but that there should be yet some other sort of Incendi∣aries to animate and help them.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> without doubt your Majesty must needs think that King <HI>James</HI> is the Head of the Party, and that there are eight Actors more, Per∣sons ready to do any thing, whose Names are these, <HI>Grandvall, Dumont, Liesdal, Rebenac, Bidal, Luxem∣burgh,
<PB N="132" REF="71"/> Paprel, Parcker, Chanlais</HI> and my self; if your Majesty accepts of the Proposition, you will give great encouragement to the Undertaking.</P>
<P>As to my self, says his Majesty, I am not alto∣gether my own Master; I have a Sovereign who reigns over my Will, and who has an Empire over me, much more absolute than that I have over my Subjects, I mean, the Guides of my Conscience, so that I dare not engage my self in the Cabal, before I have consulted my Priests.</P>
<P>Sir, says <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> the time presses and the oc∣casion is favourable.</P>
<P><HI>Barbesieux,</HI> says his Majesty, then let my Counsel of Conscience be call'd, and I will consult them thereupon. The Reverend Father <HI>la Chaize</HI> going out of the Chamber of Meditations appear'd with his triangular Cap, accompanied by Madam <HI>de Main∣tenon</HI> his Secretary, who carried under her Arm a great Book, in Folio, which had for Title, <HI>The Art to assassinate Kings.</HI> The Archbishop of <HI>Paris</HI> could not come, because of the Dispatches he had to write to <HI>Rome,</HI> the Post being just upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts departure.</P>
<P>My Reverend Father, says his Majesty, as you are a great Casuist, and that you, like St. <HI>Peter,</HI> have full power to bind and unbind with me.</P>
<P>What's the Business in hand, Sir, says the Reve∣rend Father <HI>la Chaize,</HI> being impatient of knowing what he had to put to him?</P>
<P>The Business in short, says his Majesty, is to com∣mit an execreable Attempt, and to know whether my Conscience will not be charg'd with it, if I con∣sent to it.</P>
<P>What is it then, says the Reverend Father?</P>
<P>My good Father, says his Majesty, <HI>Barbesieux</HI> has just now propos'd to me a very short way whereby I may, this Campaign, undoubtedly come to clap up a Peace, and there wants nothing but my consent to have it ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cuted.</P>
<PB N="133" REF="71"/>
<P>As what? as what? says the Reverend Fa∣ther?</P>
<P>Father, says his Majesty, it has been resolv'd to have the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> assassinated, as he who is the only Obstacle to all my Designs: and as this Prince exposes him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf very much, <HI>Grandvall</HI> and <HI>Dumont</HI> have engaged themselves to deliver him alive or dead.</P>
<P><HI>Opus plane Divinum!</HI> says the Reverend Father <HI>la Chaize.</HI> This Enterprize is all of God: <HI>Absolvo te,</HI> Sir, I absolve you. Thereupon, taking in hand the great Book that his Secretary Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> carried, he shewed to his Majesty, by the Opinion of the most celebrated Authors of the Society, to wit, the Reverend Fathers <HI>Garnet, Suares, Eudemon, Parsons, Zimancka, Escobar, Sancher, Saiman, Fili∣tius,</HI> and a great number of others, That to take off a Heretick Prince from the Christian World, by the Sword, Poison or otherwise, was a Work very acceptable to God, and the strait way that led to Paradice.</P>
<P>But 'tis time we put an end to a Conference which carries so much Horror with it, by the Devise of this great Prince, <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ni s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u qui mal y Pense;</HI> and we will only say, That he hath us'd long since heartily to forgive all his Enemi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Evils they would do him, and that he accounts it his Glory to pray to God for their R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pentance and their Conversion. But we may still av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, That it is a very base and odious Action f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <HI>F ance,</HI> and of which <HI>Louis</HI> the Great, as Triumpha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, as Glorious and as great a Politician as he is, will never wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h himself clean, tho' he should use all the Water of <HI>Versailles</HI> or the Royal Canal: Mes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>urs <HI>de Boil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>au</HI> and <HI>de la Fontain,</HI> who are employed about writing this History, ought by no means to forget marking this in great Characters, under <HI>Viro Immortali,</HI> and to speak of it
<PB N="134" REF="72"/> as one of the principal Events of his Reign. This will be the richest Flower of his Crown, and one of his fairest Pictures, capable to draw admiration from all Ages to come. But I can't forbear saying here, by the way, That there have such things been done in the Reign of this Monarch, which yet pass, in the sense of his Flatterers, for Actions Great and Heroick, which yet, to speak sincerely, are nothing less than such; and if we should put, as we say, the History of his Life and of his Reign into a Crucible, there would be wrought a very surprizing change; for instead of Gold and the other fine glittering Gimcracks, wherewith those Juglers use to cheat the deluded Multitude, there would come out nothing but so many Monsters, in different Shapes and Figures.</P>
<P>It is to be fear'd, that of all these Prodigies of Glory and Grandeur, which at present seem to be the terror of his Subjects as well as of his Enemies, and as it were essential to his good Fortune, there would remain in the Furnace only a little Dross and Smoak.</P>
<P>But hold, let us not go too far, but turn for once the other side of the Medal, and take it on the fairest side. We will speak a little of his Glory, since he loves it so much, and it is his Favourite Pas∣sion: We will own it true, that he is one of the greatest Kings that the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy ever yet hath given us; that he is a very great Politician, very Wise in his Choice, and very Vigilant in the execution of a good Design; but then we must ac∣knowledge this too, that this Prince would be a very great Hero, if he would but add to all these ex∣cellent Qualities, that one, of right knowing him∣self, without suffering his Courtiers to offer him such Incense as if he were another Divinity, and thereby commit that great oversight which <HI>Alex∣ander</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="72"/> the Great did formerly, when he exacted that they should pay him <HI>Divine Honours.</HI> Let him re∣member himself, that this was the first Forerunner of the fall of the Empire of that Prince, and of the great Designs he had conceiv'd of the Conquest of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>I would advise him then, rather to rid himself of all those <HI>Owls,</HI> who are always about his Sacred Per∣son, as Birds of an unhappy Omen, and who will leave him no more than the Devil formerly did our Saviour in the Wilderness, even till he hath pro∣mised them to do all the mischief they desire.</P>
<P>Here is the Source and Spring of all those Evils and Calamities, which at present so cruelly afflict <HI>Europe.</HI> If this Prince would but once enter into his true Interests, and would change his Council, we might then see him the Wonder of the Universe; The imaginary Immortality with which they flatter him, would then be a real and solid one; which would procure him not only the Love of his Sub∣jects, but also the Respect and Veneration of the whole World.</P>
<P>Here is enough for <HI>Louis</HI> the Great; let us go on to King <HI>James</HI> his good Friend.</P>
<P>This Prince, as all the World knows, has long since bid adieu to Glory, and therefore it may be said of him, That he is like an old Deserter who has sold all his Equipage, to go into the Service of ano∣ther Prince. Besides, it is sufficient that he is a Member of the Society, to carry in one hand the Sword and in the other the Flambeau. He ought to remember, That he was once fallen into the hands of his Competitor, who receiv'd him by Principles of Humanity and Christianity, very different from his, who fought after nothing but Popery and Slavery▪ and if he could once in his Life imitate the least of the Qualities of this great Prince,
<PB N="136" REF="73"/> whom he makes at present the Object of his Hatred, and whom he looks upon as his mortal Enemy, he would acquire many degrees of Glory and good Fortune, which he has not yet attained to, and 'tis to be feared scarce ever will. But God forgive him his Sins, and make him a good Christian, if he has not been so yet. This may suffice to say of him; let us pass on now to two other Gentlemen.</P>
<P>Here is a fitting place to make their Panegyrick in a few words. But to spare them the Shame for having been the Instruments of so detestable an Undertaking, we will be content to make them only repass in review one after another, to the end they may be well known to the World.</P>
<P>Let us begin then with Monsieur <HI>de Barbe∣sieux,</HI> who presents himself the first, his Sword in his Hand, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying, <HI>Kill, Kill;</HI> you must not wonder to see him so hot, for since the death of the Mar∣quiss <HI>de Louvois,</HI> his Father, he fears nothing so much as a Reverse of Fortune, and that <HI>Louis</HI> the Great should one time or another take a fancy to serve him, as the Crow in the Fable, that is to say, to pull off his best Feathers, in taking from him his most profitable places, as he did formerly to the Children of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lbert.</HI> So Monsieur <HI>de Barbe∣sieux,</HI> to keep himself in favour, has thought that he could not render a more signal pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of Service to his Majesty, than that of assassinating a Prince, who is at this da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bstacle to all the De∣signs of the King his Master, and the most glorious Prince in Christendom.</P>
<P>Now let us make way for Monsieur <HI>de Luxem∣burgh,</HI> and let him pass by; he wears the Sword of the late Monsieu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>de Bouteville<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Father, that is to say, a dangerous Sword, and which gives Qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter to no Body; methinks I hear him say, what <HI>Rodrigus</HI> said to the Earl, in the Play of <HI>Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
<Q><PB N="137" REF="73"/>
<L>That Arder which I carry in m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eyes,</L>
<L>Do you know it is his Blood? do you know it?</L></Q></P>
<P>So, it is not the first of his Wickednesses his hav∣ing attempted the Life of King <HI>William;</HI> and we may say of him without a Compliment, That his Sins are become a habit to him, and he is now too much advanced in years ever to have any hopes that he will correct himself.</P>
<P>But to give yet a j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea of what he can do, we will add here, to satisfie the Curious, the Arti∣cles of Agreement which he formerly made with the Devil, just as we find them in the Original, which have been communicated to us, to wit,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>That he gave himself wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o him, with Promise.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>That he would never speak of God, and that he would n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver go to Mass.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>That he should be without Pity and Mercy.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>On the other side the Devil engag'd himself,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>To favour him in all his Designs.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>To make him win all the Battles he should fight.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>To keep him always in the Love and Favour of his King.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. <HI>To cause him to have, when he would, all manner of Favours of the fairest Ladies.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>V. <HI>To make h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Invulnerable.</HI> And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. <HI>That he should live to the Age of Seventy Five Years.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But you will say, where was Monsieur <HI>de Luxem∣burgh</HI> before the Battle of <HI>Flerus,</HI> which made him live again, and drew him, as we say, from the Grave of Silence and Forgetfulness, where he had been shut
<PB N="138" REF="74"/> up since the Wars of <HI>Holland?</HI> Nothing was less be∣liev'd, than that he was yet in the World; and the Opinions were so divided th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reupon, that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> knew not what to believe. Some th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught him in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tland</HI> at the Head of the <HI>Highla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> Rebels; others believ'd him with a Turbet on in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, and turn'd into a Grand Vizier; and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uly one would have judg'd that the little Genius t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey had, the good Fortune and Progress which follow'd the first Campaign that the Infidels made in <HI>Hungary,</HI> was but an effect of his <HI>Negromancy:</HI> it was fear'd also, that he had already taught them the greatest Cun∣ning of his Art and Knowledge.</P>
<P>But others better instructed in the History of his Life, and wiser in the Affairs of the times, un∣doubtedly believ'd, That the Court of <HI>Fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather the Council of the King had thought fit to deliver him to the mercy of Justice, to make him an Example, as they had don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inviliiers,</HI> as well to appease the People and the Clergy, as to satisfie his Majesty's Council of Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cience.</P>
<P>The Reverend Father <HI>la Chaize</HI> dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar'd himself a Party against him, and fought his death, with as much fierceness, as one of the ing's Attornies doth that of a Criminal for High Treason. So they be∣gan already to sacrifice him, and all the World thought him just going to fini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h his days upon a Scaffold, with as much Infamy as his unhappy Father had done before him.</P>
<P>The Crime then which he was accus'd of had something in it the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st agg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ava<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, the most crying and the most enormous in the World, since they had join'd Poison to Magick. Besides, the death of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Count <HI>de S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issons,</HI> with which he was charg'd, cryed aloud to Heaven for Vengeance. Others believ'd that the King, as angry as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e seem'd to be against him, having made some Reflections
<PB N="139" REF="74"/> on the services, that this General had formerly done him in his former Wars, was at last pleased to change his sentence of Death into that of Banishment, or perpetual Imprisonment. There was also a sem∣blance that this last way of punishment was most likely to prevail with him, that which his Inqui∣sitors and his J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dges had chose, and which they push'd on to the last, according to the utmost ri∣gour of Law and practice.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, it is certain, and it is the judg∣ment of those who are perfectly acquainted with his History, as having always beeen near his Person in the greatest time of his disgrace; and who have very wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ingly Communicated to us the Memorials which are reported in this small Treatise. It is, I say, certain, that Monsieur the Marques <HI>de Louvois</HI> took his business so strongly to Heart, that we may say, Monsieur <HI>de Luxemburgh</HI> doth not only owe him his Liberty, but also his Life, as well as the new favours which his Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty Honours him with at present, by the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmand of his Armies, which he e'en trusts him with.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Louvois,</HI> seeing then that his bu∣siness was done, and that the poor Duke was irre∣parably lost; as he was a wise Minister, and pene∣trating what might hereafter happen, he thought that <HI>France</HI> might yet have occasion of him, con∣sidering that all the old Generals that were of any Esteem, and Reputation, began to fail them; and that the Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> as being the young∣est, was the only one who remain'd; truly Mon∣sieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and in the last place the Duke of <HI>Schomberg</HI> had been ravished from the King, those by Death, and this by the disorders of Religion; so very judiciously reflecting that the loss the King lately had of these three Captains, was irreparable, and that besides <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="75"/> was just a going into such a condition in all likely∣hood, that she stands in need of all Assistances and Instruments, he was throughly convinced that all imaginable Obstacles ought to be remov'd to preserve him.</P>
<P>He went then to find out his Majesty, and told him, Sir, this is not all; your Majesty sees your self at the very point of having all <HI>Europe</HI> upon your hands, and the War which is a going to be kind∣led, will perhaps be the bloodiest that <HI>France</HI> ever yet felt, not only in this Reign, but those that pre∣ceeded; and as your Majesty will have many Ene∣mies to fight with, so you will be obliged to have several Armies. But, Sir, that which causes not the least of my disturbances, is, to see that you have not one General left, who has understanding enough, and is capable to Command: It is true, you have yet Lieutenant Genera's enough; But for a General in Chief, who is a Man of Conduct, who has experience and cunning, and has been in Bat∣tles whether he has won or lost; it is no matter, which of them, for experience makes them Masters, I know no Body belongs to your Majesty except <HI>Luxemburgh.</HI> He is the only one who in my opini∣on, seems fit to become a great Captain, if he is not so already, and consequently in a condition to do you great service. I advise then your Majesty to pass over all his faults of which he is accus'd, to satisfie, nevertheless as much as you, can your Coun∣cel of Conscience, in leaving the Criminal at the <HI>Bastile,</HI> and causing his Tryal under-hand to be delay'd, which will flatter the hopes of his Jud∣ges, and at the same time appease the most inve∣terate against him, who not being able to divine the true cause, will tire themselves with talking about it; and your Majesty will preserve thereby a Subject, who may be serviceable to you in business when it shall be a fit time.</P>
<PB N="141" REF="75"/>
<P>After this Discourse Monsieur <HI>de Louvois,</HI> obser∣ving that his Majesty appear'd half shaken, thought that Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> would be of great help to him, to push on the business effectually. He went then to speak with he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and represented to her as he had done to the King, the necessity there was to save this General which was lost without recovery, if he should be left fifteen days more in the hands of his Judges, who would by all extremity m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke him an Example. He added that there was no time to be lost, &amp; that <HI>France</HI> would one day owe him great Obligations, if she would save a Subject, who was so dear and so necessary for her, which besides the great services he had al∣ready render'd the Crown, gave yet great hopes for the future, That he was the only one left, of so many brave Captains, who had Commanded in the former Wars, and who having serv'd under <HI>Turenne</HI> and <HI>Conde,</HI> had learnt by these great Men many fine qualities necessary for the Government and Conduct of an Army, which will not be found in the Person of another General.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Maintenon,</HI> who is a true Siren near the King, and who sees her self Mistress of the Heart and Will of this Monarch, by her flattering Amours, was so lively perswaded by the Discourse of Monsieur <HI>de Lovois,</HI> that she immediately espou∣sed the cause, and the interest of Monsieur <HI>de Lux∣emburgh,</HI> and promis'd the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> to speak to the King the very first visit she made, ad∣ding withal, that she did not doubt but she should obtain the pardon of this unhappy Man, and draw him out of his disgrace, unless that the Instances and the Intrigues of Father <HI>La Chaize,</HI> and of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Paris</HI> should prevail over hers; that for him who was the chief of the Clergy of <HI>France,</HI> she had the means in her Hands to appease him, but that Father <HI>La Chaize,</HI> would give her a great deal more trouble, because this good Father was
<PB N="142" REF="76"/> an Enemy to be fear'd, and it was by no means good to have him a party against one; that she would endeavour nevertheless to perswade both the one, and the other, which she also did, and Monsieur <HI>de Luxemburgh</HI> was no less beholding for his liberty to Madam <HI>de Maintenon,</HI> than to Monsieur <HI>de Louvois,</HI> since they equally labour'd for his preserva∣tion.</P>
<P>The King having been thus prepossess'd, and the Storm rais'd against him entirely appeas'd, the Duke began to hope in Prison to have some more Liberty, and to tast some comfort. He was no more kept so close up, and his Guards began to be∣come more negligent in observing him; He was ne∣vertheless kept in the Bastille a long time af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erwards, by which the Court thought to become Guiltless in the Eyes of the World, to the end it might not seem altogether a Connivance, and an Authorizing of the Crime by granting liberty to a Criminal, whom all the Laws condemn'd to death. This was done only to dispose by degrees the People and his Inquisitors, to receive with less noise the news of his Release. The time being then come that <HI>France</HI> had occasion for him, as the Marquess <HI>de Louvois</HI> had foretold; and the King having expe∣rienc'd the first Campaign, which was that of 1689. that his Armies were ill govern'd, and that they did not Act conformab y to his intention, and as he had well enough laid the Scheam; that if on the other side his Arms had not had success that year, it was not for want of Forces, and being seconded and supported by great Armies, but rather the fault of the General, who was neither undertaking enough, nor cunning enough. His Majesty ha∣ving caus'd the Duke of <HI>Luemburgh,</HI> to be call'd would in granting him grace and pardon take oc∣casion from thence to engage him by new favours
<PB N="143" REF="76"/> to be more mindful than ever of his Interests; and make that his acknowledment, should be a potent inducement to this General, to excel above all what he had done well and glorious for the service of his Prince, in the former Wars, and particular∣ly in that of <HI>Holland,</HI> where he had signaliz'd him∣self by his Cruelties. And as the matter in hand, was to give him the Command of the Army in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> because it was there where he had the best succeeded, if we except the Battle of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> the King wisely thought that he would not fail to make himself quickly talk'd of, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to feel new marks of his inhumanity, which <HI>France</HI> wanted above all things to oblige yet tottering Fortune to declare her self for her Arms.</P>
<P>It was resolv'd upon, utterly to ruin the rest of <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> to the end that he might be∣come Master of them with more ease, thereby to force the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to hearken to new propositions of Peace, which is the aim of his Majesty, and the design of the Court.</P>
<P>Experience shews us then at this day, that the Marquess <HI>de Lovois</HI> was in the right. For Monsieur <HI>de Luxemburgh</HI> strives on his side fully to answer all the expectations of his Benefactor, and the hopes he had conceiv'd of him, by the signal Services which he renders his Majesty, not only in helping him to support the heavy burden of the present War; but also in discovering to him a short and abridg'd way to come quickly to a glorious Peace; and as he is a Man that abounds in malice, and knows sufficiently what is Good and Evil, yet he strives to forget that little of Humanity, and Chri∣stianity which is left him, &amp; goes on in a full Career, with his Sword in his Hand, into that Cabal, which seeks how to find out Kings, and then to assassinate them. Here is enough for Monsieur <HI>de Luxemburgh,</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="77"/> let us finish his Chapter, and bid him adieu for altogether, with putting him in mind that 'tis high time for him to set about his Conversion, unless he will dye as he has liv'd.</P>
<P>Let us go on to Monsieur <HI>de Chanlais,</HI> Fourth Actor of this Cabal, he keeps himself behind the Hangings, feigning as if he had hid himself. He does like those that throw a Stone, and hide their Arm. But methinks he would do better to acquit himself well, of the Charge which he possess in the Army, that would be more honourable, and more glorious for him, than to make here the sorrowful Figure of the <HI>Valet</HI> of a Hangman, in lending his hand to the Assassinates.</P>
<P>Behold Monsieur <HI>Rabenac</HI> who walks a pace, let us see what he will have to say to justifie himself for having had also a part in so black of an Action. He will not fail to say, that the overgreat Zeal he had for the Interests of the King his Master did en∣gage him therein.</P>
<P>What slavery is this, That a Minister should en∣gage to commit a detestable Crime before God and Men, for nothing but to please his Prince! But it may be he will perform his Repentance, whilst he is at <HI>Rome,</HI> and ask pardon of God and of the Holy Father for so great a Sin.</P>
<P>For Messieurs <HI>Bidal</HI> and <HI>Paparal,</HI> we will put them together to make the balance even, because they are truly of the same Metal and the same Weight. And if for curiosity one should weigh their malice, I do not believe they would either of them want many Scruples to make the Scale even. So it is no very strange thing, that they have plaid the same part in this Tragedy. Good God then have mercy on them.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>Parker</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, we
<PB N="145" REF="78"/> may justly say he follow'd the Councils of his Prince King <HI>James,</HI> who engag'd him to the Party by fair promises of advancing his Fortunes; and we may say of him, that the Man was not better than the Master; so let God give him Peace as the rest.</P>
<P>But hold, here is one would fain slip by, what shall we say of him? he seems as if he were afraid of being known. He appears to me the more to be fear'd, therefore let us have a care of him, and let him go by quickly. It seems he is not wholly well pleased; for we dont any longer see that smiling Countenance which he used to shew when he was at the <HI>Hague</HI> as he went out in a Coach. But I am impatient to know him, therefore through Curio∣sity let us pull off his Mask: Ho, ho, it is Monsieur <HI>Moreau.</HI></P>
<P>To spare a great deal of confusion, let us content our selves with making him the Complement that <HI>Seneca</HI> in his Tragedies caus'd to be made to <HI>Jason</HI> speaking to <HI>Medea, purga Regnum, &amp; veneficas tecum aufer herbas,</HI> that he may be gone as soon as possi∣bly, and carry with him all the evil he would have done to the State, and that he may come back no more.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Grandval, Dumont</HI> and <HI>Leefdal,</HI> the last A∣ctors of this Tragick Scene, I do not pretend to speak one word of them, because I look upon them, as the executioners of the Orders of the So∣vereign Tribunal, which made them Act; and that's sufficient for their Apology.</P>
<P>But we must not forget here the Encomiums of Madam <HI>de Maintenon,</HI> who has made no scruple neither to fowl her Fair White Hands in the Plot of an Assassinate. She is at least as much to be fear'd as the Goddess of <HI>Discord</HI> formerly was at the Feasts of the Marriage of <HI>Peleus,</HI> and would not
<PB N="146" REF="79"/> fail to revenge her self in a much more cruel man∣ner than this Important and Angry Goddess did. It is also to be fear'd, that she would throw into the Assembly, either some Carcasses or some Bombs, instead of Golden Apples. Let us then prevent her Jealousie and her Fury; for a Woman in Wrath is dangerous. Let us give her rather Incense to appease her, and say in her praise, that she is Virtuous, Zealous, and Active as may be; that she strives also to render great Services to the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy; and that when ever we come to a Peace she will have no less Contributed to it, by her Cares, than the Arms of her Monarch. But let us say also at the same time, that she gives a very bad example to the Ladies of the Abby of St. <HI>Cyr,</HI> of which she is Superiour, and that his Ma∣jesties Council of Conscience, will never justifie her before God▪ for the Crime she has committed, in giving her advice to so horrible an attempt. I advise her then to dispose of her self early, to go make her Repentance in the Convent of Penitents by the Example of those that have gone before her. Here is enough for her, let us go on.</P>
<P>As for the Reverend Father <HI>La Chaize.</HI> Me∣thinks I see him appear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olding in one hand the Sword, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h which the great St. <HI>Igna∣tius</HI> was about to kill the <HI>Moor</HI> (in going his Voyage to <HI>Spain</HI>) who would maintain to him that the bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> was no Virgin af∣ter the Conception.</P>
<P>Methinks also, in the other Hand he carries a Book in Folio, which has for Title, <HI>The Art to ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssinate Kings and Princes.</HI> But let us not enter into a Dispute with him, for fear he should be oblig'd to borrow all the Eloquence of Father <HI>Bourdalou</HI> to justifie himself. To raise yet again the Glory of all these Tragical Actors, we may join here to
<PB N="147" REF="79"/> their Cabal, the Il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustrious <HI>James Clement, Barriere, Chastel, Ravaillac, John Iuvr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gni, Venero, Balthuzar Gerard, Peter Paine, Parri</HI> and a great many more of them, as we may find by the Rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bad∣neira</HI> the Jesuit, <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>ch.</HI> 3. who have attempted the Lives of the Kings, <HI>Henry</HI> the Third and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, of Great <HI>William</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> his Son Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and of Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth.</HI></P>
<P>But it is no astonishing thing that we see at this day all the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and so many brave Lords who have formerly witnessed their having had a Horror for so detestablea Doctrine, to be never∣theless blindly engaged in such a Cabal, after having cruelly underwrit to the death of the greatest Prince of <HI>Europe.</HI> After this Stroke, I say, may we not say, That the whole Monarchy is at this day govern'd by Jesuits; and that instead of one <HI>Louis</HI> the Fourteenth, we see one Father <HI>la Chaize</HI> reigning and sitting upon the Throne of the <HI>French,</HI> giving his Orders, and making all his Tragical and Bloody Actors to perform their parts.</P>
<P>And as the Soul of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> is an Active Soul, and by consequence, the most conformable to the Soul of this Reverend Father, so has he been cho∣sen to be at the Head of these Assassinates the bet∣ter to command them, and to add yet this Expe∣dition to the History of his Life, as the last Master∣piece of it.</P>
<P>But let us come to our purpose, and confess, That all these Proceedings are made by <HI>France,</HI> to come quickly to her end, which is an advantagious Peace. Let us also add, for Concl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion, That <HI>Louis</HI> the Great, often mistakes himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Execution of his vast Designs; since of all the Resolutions he had taken for this Campaign, Experience has shewn us that he was out in his Account▪ about the Imagi∣nary
<PB N="148" REF="80"/> Re-establishment of King <HI>James,</HI> about the Engagement at Sea, about the Entry of the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> into <HI>Dauphine,</HI> and about the assassinating of King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, he made himself Master of <HI>Namur,</HI> which was one of the four great Undertakings that was the object of his Ambition. But then we may also own, that this Triumph has been sufficiently counterbalanc'd by the ruin of his Fleet, and of the Designs of King <HI>James,</HI> which are all blown into the Air, by the glorious Irruption of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who has put his Country under Contribution; and, lastly, by the Shame and Infamy which will always attend the Baseness of having attempted on the Life of so great a Prince. And here are the Events which have flatter'd this Monarch into the begin∣ning of a Campaign, but which nevertheless have not answer'd the great hopes he had conceiv'd. Let us see, at present, what he will undertake anew, and if his Projects will have the same Success the next Campaign: Let us wait for him boldly, and make him see that our People are not so weary of the War as his Subjects; and that if he will come to a glorious Peace, with which he flatters himself, and seeks after with eagerness, he must, at the least, surrender up all his Conquests.</P>
