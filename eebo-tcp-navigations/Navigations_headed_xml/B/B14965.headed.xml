<HEAD>The Continuation of our Weekely NEWES. The Extract of an Oration of his Majestie of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> made in the presence of his cheifest <HI>Peeres, Earles, Lords, Warlike Commaunders,</HI> and other Officers, on the 10. of <HI>August.</HI> 1632. neere the City of <HI>Norimbergh.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>IS Royall Majestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> caused all his Commanders and Officers from the high∣est to the lowest to come before him, and made an Oration vnto them of an houre long, concerning the pillaging and robbing, and some insolencies committed by his Souldiers: which his said Majestie labouring to suppresse, v∣sed in this his Oration such motiues and arguments, that his earnest and eloquent expression forced teares from the eyes of many of his chiefe Commaunders. The Contents whereof you haue in this Extract.</P>
<P>You Peeres, Earles, and Lords, Yee are partly of those, who haue shewed themselues vnfaithfull and disloyall to your owne Countrey, and doe helpe to ruinate the same. You Ge∣neralls, Lieutenant-Generalls, (and all you the rest inferiour Officers) I haue ever held and esteemed you for vpright and stout Cavalliers, and I doe witnesse for you, that vpon occa∣sion offered, you haue in fighting given such demonstration of your valour, as that I haue therewithall rested satisfied.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<P>But when I doe behold you present here before me, and doe consider of, and call to mind your stealing, robbing, and pilla∣ging, and that ye also doe participate, and are guiltie of those insolencies, and obserue no discipline, nor doe no justice, all my haires doe stand an end. Is not this a dolefull case and la∣mentable, and odious in the sight of God, that one Christian and joynt religious, one friend another, yea one brother shall pillage and ransacke another, and spoile, and ruinate, and vn∣doe another: the Devills in hell doe shew more loue, and are more trustie one to another, then you Christians are among your selues.</P>
<P>My heart faileth mee, and my bowels yearne within mee, when I doe heare that the <HI>Swedisb</HI> Souldiers are more insolent then those of the enemy: when indeed not <HI>Swedes,</HI> but the <HI>Germanes</HI> commit the insolencies: had I knowne that ye had beene of such an humour, and had borne no more affection to your owne natiue Countrey, and that you would haue done no better service for the same, nor shewed more fidelitie: I had never so much as sadled an horse for your sakes, much lesse ever haue adventured my Kingdome, my life and goods, and with mine owne person haue adventured so many stout and valorous men for your welfare: but I would rather since I perceiue that you aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct and desire it, haue suffered you to re∣maine plunged in the greatest and most miserable servitude and slaverie. Yee know full well, that I do not easily or slight∣ly denie any of you any reasonable request, &amp; my God know∣eth, that I never intend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d any other thing, but (by his blessed assistance) to restore every man to their owne, and their own to them: and for the remainder, especially what I obtaine in <HI>Franconia</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> to distribute and impart among you, and to leaue none of you vnrecompenced for your faithfull service: but your accursed and divellish robbing and stealing doth hinder and keepe me backe in all my Christian intenti∣ons. Can you not consider what praise and fame posteritie will leaue you in future histories? what a burthen you will lay on your owne consciences? and what judgements and
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y"/> punishments you draw vpon your selues, your posteritie, the whole Countrey, and those that shall succeed you? Oh that you doe not consider, what an account you are to yeelde vp at that great and dreadfull day of account. I would rather haue remained within mine owne Kingdome, than I would longer behold such base insolencies. Perchance you may say, you want monies; but when I haue the meanes to satisfie both you, and the whole Armie, and you by pillaging, rob∣bing, and stealing depriue me of those meanes, I beseech you than where is the fault? What doe I receiue of all your prey? just nothing. I doe protest before God, and it is truth, that of all this warre I haue not so much enriched my selfe as the worth of a paire of bootes; and I professe withall, that I would rather ride without bootes, than any wayes in the least measure to enrich my selfe by the losse and prejudice of other poore men. I will make it appeare to you, and to those that desire therein to be satisfied, that I haue had made over vnto me since I came out of mine owne Kingdome, at 32. severall times, aboue 40. tunne of Gold, which I haue spent for your good, and the restauration of those that are vnited with mee in the true Religion. I confesse I might herein bee silent, but the consideration of the great losse that I haue sustained of so many braue Worthies and Cavalleres, whose vertues indeed were beyond estimation, constrained mee to speake what I doe; and truely I valued them beyond all my wealth. And for your parts what haue you contributed? I desire nothing at your hands but onely this, that you depriue and rob not o∣thers of their goods, but leaue vnto every man his owne.</P>
<P>This Oration which was in part penned by many, tooke vp divers sheetes of paper. This is but onely the extract and part of it.</P>
<P>After the Oration ended, his Majestie made strict prohibi∣tion, and added therevnto a commination, that hee would spare none hence-forward, Peere, nor Earle, Generall, nor Commander. And in case they should mutinie, hee with his
<PB N="4" REF="4" MS="y"/> <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Finlanders</HI> would vndertake so to rattle them, that the very shivers should flie about. Which prohibition was no sooner proclaimed with the sound of trumpets, but hee caused a Lieutenant to be hanged for commiting some of the aforesaid insolencies.</P>
<P>When as a certaine Pesant or Countryman came and made complaint to his Majestie of some Souldiers who had robbed him of a Cow; his Majestie himselfe in person rod along with him to find out the parties: when hee shewed his Ma∣jestie where the Cow was notwithstanding the Captaine &amp; Lieutenant excused the partie, he caused him to be brought to the Provost, and delivered vp into the hands of Iustice; But there was earnest intercession made for him by the Comman∣ders and Captaines vnto his Majestie, who with compassion spake thus vnto the Delinquent: My sonne, it is better that I should punish you, than that for your mis-deedes the wrath of God and his Iudgments should fall vpon me, and thee, and all of vs.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Norimberg</HI> the <HI>2.</HI> of August, <HI>1632.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Concerning my dolefull estate I doubt not but all the world is therewith acquainted, In these 4. weekes we haue recei∣ved no letters from <HI>Overland</HI> nor <HI>Augsburg:</HI> The Enemy is rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d about vs with two great Armies, and is enquartered a∣bout <HI>Steyn,</HI> and <HI>Eyba,</HI> and the same River a mile from this Ci∣tie, and as farre from the Army. We can daily see the Enemy swarue to and from our Steeple. The skirmishes continue daily, and many Spies are brought prisoners hither: which Spies are pub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ikely examined, by which meanes we know all the Enemies designes and enterprises. Yesterday was brought prisoner here the Generall Quarter-Maister of <HI>Wallensteyn,</HI> who had the bed-role or Catalogue about him of <HI>Wallensteyns</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bavarias</HI> whole Armie; he is daily served at
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> Table with 6. silver dishes of good cheare, and 2. bottels of wine; he and his doe all complaine of extreame hunger and want in their Armies.</P>
<P>His Majestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> shews himselfe wondrous curteous and loving towards all the Citizens here, &amp; remaines excee∣ding couragious. His Army is very well fortified, insomuch, that it is impossible for any enemy to raise the same, or almost to oppose him; notwithstanding his Army alone is none of the greatest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> doe daily defeate some of the Enemies Con∣voyes: and although I confesse indeed by reason of these trou∣bles and turmoiles our trading ceaseth, yet God bee praised: wee are exceeding well provided of all things. It doth very much animate and comfort vs, that his Majestie is so chea∣rie and tender of vs, and doth so couragiously protect vs, and establisheth decent and good order overall.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Another from <HI>Norimberg</HI> of later date, wherein is declared the whole present estate of both Armies.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Walsteyn</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> doe now onely striue and endevour to intercept and cut off all victualls provi∣sion and convoyes from his Majestie of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as yet re∣mayning within his Fortifications before <HI>Norimbergh.</HI> Wherfore the better to accomplish his ends, the said <HI>Wallen∣steyn</HI> by force hath taken a strong Castle <HI>Liechtenaw</HI> not farre from <HI>Anspach</HI> and 4. miles fom <HI>Norimbergh</HI> which Fort otherwise, is vnder the power of the <HI>Norimbergers.</HI> The King to revenge himselfe and to bee euen with and requite and serue his enemy with the same sauce did inquire and found out where the store or Magazen of corne was reserued for <HI>Wallersteyn</HI> &amp; the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> to wit at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ryenstaat</HI>) which is a Citie in the vpper <HI>Palatinate</HI> situated in a very
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> moorish place, fiue miles from <HI>Norimbergh,</HI> and 2. from <HI>New∣march</HI> which also is in the superior <HI>Palatinate.</HI> Wherefore with 1000. Muskets, and some troupes of horse, in the night they went to <HI>Karnbergh,</HI> two miles distance from the towne of <HI>Fryenstadt,</HI> and from thence he sent a certaine Colonell far∣ther) namely to <HI>Fryenstadt.</HI> Who assisted with his souldiers, and hauing hung some <HI>Patars</HI> at the gate of the Citie broke them open, entred, and puts some to the sword. Hee there burnt a great multitude of Corne, which was enough to sup∣ply <HI>Wallensteyns</HI> Armie for two moneths together. Among o∣ther victuals, there was 70000. pounds of bread; the <HI>Swedish</HI> brought with them 400. Bullockes, and 500. Horses to <HI>No∣rimberg.</HI> In their returne the Commander, a Colonell of <HI>Wal∣lensteyns</HI> Armie, with 3. Regiments comes towards the King, whose number of Souldiers did not exceed <HI>Wallensteyns</HI> Co∣lonels number, to wit <HI>Spaar.</HI> The Kings Majestie with his forces behaved himselfe so valorous and strong▪ that many Ensignes were taken by them, and 400. of <HI>Spaars</HI> forces were slain, and an hundred Officers or more, beside the Com∣mander <HI>Spaar</HI> himselfe were taken prisoners. The King lost 40. men, and one Captaine, with two Officers.</P>
<P>Before the King came to <HI>Fryenstadt,</HI> a certaine Major was sent before (as it is the manner of warre) to spie out the wayes and devices of the Enemy. This Major by chance and vnawarres fell into the hands of the aforesaid <HI>Spaar,</HI> and was taken prisoner. <HI>Spaar</HI> presently questions with him, &amp; askes him where is the King? the Major answers, he is hard by▪ what Army is hee provided withall? he answers, with some Troupes of horse; hath he no Musketiers? sayd <HI>Spaar:</HI> no, answers the other; then certainely it is the King said <HI>Spaar,</HI> and he shall presently be in my hands: but it was not long af∣ter ere <HI>Spaar</HI> found the contrary by woefull experience, for hee fell into the Ditch, which he had digged for another.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<P>Moreouer because his Maiesty for the maintaining of such huge and great armies hath need of great store of moneyes he hath for a certaine time borrowed 480000. Ryxdollers of the Citizens of <HI>Norembergh,</HI> to the end that he may giue content in part to the soldiers, who otherwise (wee know) are not so ready to fight, but these moneyes being distributed a∣mongst the soldiers of his Maiesty they are all of them excee∣dingly animated and forward to fight vpon all occasions. For other necessaries the Kings Armyes are supplyed from the City <HI>Norembergh,</HI> out of the Magazine, as Bread, Powder, shot, great O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dnance and the like necessaries. At <HI>Oxfurt</HI> (which is an Imperiall City) distant 6. miles from <HI>Norim∣bergh,</HI> there is a coniunction made of these Armies, to wit that of the Duke of <HI>Weymar,</HI> the Chancellor <HI>Oxensterne,</HI> the Land∣graue of <HI>Hessen,</HI> and sixe Regiments of <HI>Saxons,</HI> the number of those Armies being all ioyned in one, doe make aboue 36000. men.</P>
<P>The City before mentioned <HI>Freynstadt,</HI> with another chiefe place named <HI>Holnsteyn</HI> were formerly by the gift of the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> conferred vpon Mons: <HI>Tilly,</HI> for they are places of great note, and strength, and great reuenues, to the end that those charges raised might bee sufficient meanes for <HI>Tilly</HI> to establish and reserue his Authority but not onely <HI>Tilly</HI> but also the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> himselfe, are stript &amp; depriued of them. For they belonged not to them, but by right are due, to the Prince Elector <HI>Palatine.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Polonia</HI> it is written hither, that the Coronation of the King is deferred vntill the 17. day of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>It is beleeued that the eldest sonne of the defunct King will bee chosen. All the Euangelicall and Protestants in <HI>Polonia,</HI> are on that side, because hee hath promised vnto them, all free exercise of Religion, and a new Donatiue, and a confirmation of all their auncient priuiledges.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Dresden</HI> the <HI>13.</HI> of August.</HEAD>
<P>The assembly and generall meeting of the Senators and de∣puties of the Nobility at <HI>Warson</HI> in <HI>Polonia</HI> is ended and ano∣ther day of meeting is prescribed in <HI>September</HI> the 17. for the choise of a new King, which generall Dyet, will last (accord∣ing to auncient custome) sixe weekes. The common opini∣on is, that the eldest sonne <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> without the competiti∣on of any other will obtaine the Crowne. The Protestants are much bent that way, but the Papists haue much opposed the same. The Papists did also oppose and hinder that liberty which the Protestants expected to haue beene granted them, in the late assembly, and now they must content themselues with a larger certaintie.</P>
<P>Concerning the warre in <HI>Muscouia,</HI> it seemes that all is there againe appeased. Onely in <HI>Polonia</HI> there is great feare of an inuasion by the <HI>Tartarians,</HI> but there is good order and proui∣sion made to preuent that.</P>

God grant vs good successe, wee doe dayly take many prisoners who most of them betake themselues into the Kings seruices, they do exceedingly complaine of want and
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> great need in their Armies. The old soldiers of the Enemiee, runne away, and the new ones are altogether vnskilled.

First the good successe which it hath pleased God to affoord vnto Duke <HI>Bernard Wey∣mar,</HI> insomuch that many cheife soldiers, are come into his seruice, and many of the cheife Commanders are taken priso∣ners.

<P>The King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> is still about this City, and all his o∣ther forces are ioyned together. The Enemie <HI>Walsteyn,</HI> and <HI>Bauaria,</HI> are not aboue a <HI>Dutch</HI> mile from him: By all likely∣hood it cannot bee long before there happen a bloody encoun∣ter. Yesterday both in this City, and the Kings Army, (as wee did lately giue thankes publikely, for the victory about <HI>Freynsladt,</HI> so) wee had a day of Fasting, and Praying, for his Maiesties future good successe. And this day, his Maiesty hath distributed the monies amongst his soldiers, which monies hee borrowed of the Citizens of <HI>Norimberg,</HI> and <HI>Franckford,</HI> for a yeare, with 6. <HI>per cent.</HI> interest. So that the souldiers be∣ing they haue receiued pay, are the more animated: to what they must ere long vndertake. There are also diuers other col∣lections made for the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> forces. I trust that now the King is so well provided and hath gotten all his for∣ces together hee will shortly adventure vpon the Enemie, and indeed they must fight, for the victuals begins to fall very short, insomuch, that some are ready to dye for hunger. And in the Enemies Camp, is farre greater want then in the Kings Army. Wee in the City want no Corne, onely wee haue not Mills enough to grind the same.</P>
