<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF <HI>Roswall</HI> and <HI>Lillian.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>NOw will ye list a little space,</L>
<L>And I shall send you to solace:</L>
<L>You to solace, and be blyth,</L>
<L>Hearken, ye shall hear belyve</L>
<L>A tale that is of veritie,</L>
<L>If ye will hearken unto me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In <HI>Naples</HI> lived there a King,</L>
<L>Had all the lands in Governing.</L>
<L>Who had a Lady fair and young,</L>
<L>Whose name was called <HI>Lillian:</HI></L>
<L>This Lady pleasant was and fair,</L>
<L>Bare him a Son, which was his Heir,</L>
<L>Whose name was called <HI>Roswall:</HI></L>
<L>Of fairer heard I never tell;</L>
<L>Princes to him could not compare,</L>
<L><HI>Ulisses</HI> nor <HI>Gandifere,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI> nor <HI>Troyalus,</HI></L>
<L>Nor yet his Father <HI>Priamus:</HI></L>
<L>The Knight that kept the Parent well,</L>
<L>Was not so fair as <HI>Roswall.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There lived into that Countrie,</L>
<L>Worthy noble Lords three,</L>
<L>That to the King had done treason,</L>
<PB REF="6"/>
<L>Therefore he put them in prison;</L>
<L>And there he held them many a day,</L>
<L>Till they were aged quite away,</L>
<L>Aged and quite o'regrown with hair,</L>
<L>While of their lives they did despair,</L>
<L>That they knew of no remedie,</L>
<L>But looked after death daily;</L>
<L>So it befell upon a day</L>
<L>The young Prince he went to play,</L>
<L>Him to play and to solace,</L>
<L>And so it happened in that case,</L>
<L>Toward the Prison he is gone,</L>
<L>To hear thir Lords making their moan,</L>
<L>He sate down and a little staid,</L>
<L>To hearken what thir Lords said:</L>
<L>They said, dear God, have mind of us,</L>
<L>Even for the sake of dear Iesus,</L>
<L>Who bought us with his precious blood,</L>
<L>And for us dyed on the rood,</L>
<L>To help us, if thy will it be,</L>
<L>And of this Prison make us frée.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The young Prince did hear their moan,</L>
<L>He heard their mourning and their groan:</L>
<L>Then to his Chamber he is gone,</L>
<L>Heavy in heart, as sad as stone;</L>
<L>He sate down and did foresée,</L>
<L>How best thir Lords might helped be,</L>
<L>And so he thought upon a wyle,</L>
<L>The King how he might best beguile;</L>
<L>A custome then had the Iaylors,</L>
<L>Who keeped ay the Prisoners,</L>
<L>After the doors all locked were,</L>
<L>Vnto the King the keyes to bear,</L>
<L>The King used them to lay</L>
<PB REF="6"/>
<L>Vnder his bed-head privily.</L>
<L>The Prince soon perceiving had,</L>
<L>Where the King the keyes laid:</L>
<L>And on a night he watch did keep</L>
<L>Till that the King was fallen asleep:</L>
<L>He took the keyes full privilie,</L>
<L>And to the Prison gone is he,</L>
<L>Who did deliver thir Lords thrée,</L>
<L>Bade them passe home to their Countrie:</L>
<L>And then they swore by sweet Iesus,</L>
<L>If ever ye mister help of us,</L>
<L>We shall you help into your néed:</L>
<L>Glad was he having done the déed.</L>
<L>The keyes laid under his Fathers head,</L>
<L>And went and sleept as he were dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The King rose and eke the Queen,</L>
<L>The Principal, and Lords bedeen;</L>
<L>They went to messe and then to dine,</L>
<L>The Iaylors all did come in syne,</L>
<L>Asked from the King the keyes,</L>
<L>Which to deliver did him please:</L>
<L>Then to the Prison they went in fear,</L>
<L>To give the Lords their dinner there;</L>
<L>But when they came all were away,</L>
<L>They knew not what to do nor say.</L>
<L>The Prisoners away were gone,</L>
<L>How, or what way known to none.</L>
<L>The King was then so dollorous,</L>
<L>That the three Lords were scaped thus:</L>
<L>He sayes, O Lord, how may this be,</L>
<L>That thir Prisoners hath been made frée:</L>
<L>Vnder my bed-head lay the keyes,</L>
<L>None knew thereof, as God me ease.</L>
<PB REF="7"/>
<L>And here I make a solemn vow,</L>
<L>Before you all my Lords now,</L>
<L>Who ere he be hath done the deed,</L>
<L>He shall be hang'd without remeed:</L>
<L>Or else so soon as I him see,</L>
<L>My own two hands his bane shall be:</L>
<L>It was reported through the Town,</L>
<L>That the young Prince the deed had done;</L>
<L>The word throughout the Pallace ran,</L>
<L>Which made the King a grieved man,</L>
<L>When he the vow considered,</L>
<L>And that his Son had done the déed.</L>
<L>The Queen then far more grieved was:</L>
<L>She mourn'd and wéeped with her face.</L>
<L>And quickly to the King went she,</L>
<L>Who, knéeling down upon her knée,</L>
<L>Thus said, for him that sits on hie,</L>
<L>Let your Sons fault forgiven be:</L>
<L>That may not be Madam, he said,</L>
<L>For I a faithfull vow have made,</L>
<L>That assoon as I may him see,</L>
<L>My own two hands his bane shall be;</L>
<L>Therefore I pray you, day and night,</L>
<L>To keep him well out of my sight,</L>
<L>Till I send him to some Countrie,</L>
<L>Where he may safely keeped be.</L>
<L>And then in haste down sate the King,</L>
<L>Wrote letters without tarrying,</L>
<L>To send his Son to the King of <HI>Bealm,</HI></L>
<L>For to remain in that Realm.</L>
<L>Still to continue with the King,</L>
<L>Till he sent for his home-coming,</L>
<L>Letters in haste then soon wrote he,</L>
<PB REF="7"/>
<L>Desiring the King especiallie,</L>
<L>For to receive his own dear Son,</L>
<L>Which for most trust was sent to him.</L>
<L>His furnishing was made ready,</L>
<L>And he got gold in great plenty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Kings Steward, a stalward Knight,</L>
<L>Was made to keep him day and night,</L>
<L>And so his servant for to be,</L>
<L>To keep him well in that Countrie:</L>
<L>The Queen did look to the Steward,</L>
<L>And said, my love, my joy, my heart,</L>
<L>Sir Steward, now I do thée pray,</L>
<L>To keep my Son both night and day,</L>
<L>And serve him both by foot and hand,</L>
<L>And thou shalt have both gold and land,</L>
<L>Or yet of any other thing</L>
<L>That thou'lt seek from me or the King,</L>
<L>He said, Madam, that may not be,</L>
<L>But I will serve him tenderlie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She sayes, my fair Son <HI>Roswall,</HI></L>
<L>Hearken what I to thee will tell,</L>
<L>When thou dost come to that Country,</L>
<L>Carry thy self right honestly,</L>
<L>Be Courteous, Genty, kind and frée,</L>
<L>And use ay in good companie:</L>
<L>And if thou needest ought to spend,</L>
<L>Send word to me, I shall thee send.</L>
<L>He took his leave then of the Queen,</L>
<L>And of her Ladies all bedeen:</L>
<L>Great mourning and great care they made</L>
<L>When that out of the Town they rade,</L>
<L>The Gracious God mot be his guide.</L>
<L>So on a time as they did ride,</L>
<PB REF="8"/>
<L>Side for side, hand for hand rode they,</L>
<L>None other saw they in the way,</L>
<L>Only they two in companie,</L>
<L>Came to a River fair to see:</L>
<L>The Prince then said unto the Knight,</L>
<L>My counsell is that here we light:</L>
<L>For in this place I thirst so sore,</L>
<L>That further can I ride no more,</L>
<L>Till of this water I get my fill:</L>
<L>Wot ye how I may win there till;</L>
<L>The Knight leapt down deliverlie,</L>
<L>And drank the water busilie:</L>
<L>He bade him light and drink also</L>
<L>His fill ere he should further go:</L>
<L>And on his belly, as he lay down</L>
<L>To drink the water ready bown.</L>
<L>The false Knight took him by the féet,</L>
<L>And vow'd to throw him in the déep,</L>
<L>Vnlesse that he did swear an oath,</L>
<L>That he the Gold and letters both</L>
<L>Should unto him resign gladly,</L>
<L>And his servant become truly,</L>
<L>To serve him well both day and night,</L>
<L>This oath he made to the false Knight:</L>
<L>He the Master, and he the knave:</L>
<L>He gave to him what he would crave.</L>
<L>And then anone withoutten stay,</L>
<L>They mounted both and went their way,</L>
<L>While they came to the Land of <HI>Bealm,</HI></L>
<L>And had past much of that Realm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Kings Pallace when they came near</L>
<L><HI>Roswall</HI> made sorry chear:</L>
<L>For the Knight did him forbid,</L>
<PB REF="8"/>
<L>Further with him for to ride;</L>
<L>He would fee servants in the Town,</L>
<L>Abundance of all fashion.</L>
<L>Away he rode then with his gold,</L>
<L>Leaving poor <HI>Roswall</HI> on the mold,</L>
<L>With not a penny in's companie</L>
<L>To buy his dinner, though he should die.</L>
<L>So to the Town in by he rode,</L>
<L>And in the Kings Pallace abode.</L>
<L>In his heart was great rejoycing,</L>
<L>Presented his letters to the King;</L>
<L>He read his letters hastily,</L>
<L>And said, Sir, welcome mot ye be;</L>
<L>Ye shall to me be love and dear,</L>
<L>So long as ye will tarry here,</L>
<L>Now in the Court we let him dwell.</L>
<L>And we will speak of <HI>Roswall▪</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Roswall</HI> was mourning on the mold,</L>
<L>Wanting his letters and his gold:</L>
<L>He sayes, alace, and woe is me,</L>
<L>For lack of food, I'm like to die;</L>
<L>O that my Mother knew my skaith.</L>
<L>My Father and my Mother baith:</L>
<L>For now I wot not what to do,</L>
<L>Nor what hand to turn me to:</L>
<L>Neither know I how to call me,</L>
<L>But I'm <HI>Dissawar</HI> what e're befall me,</L>
<L>As then he making was his moan,</L>
<L>Beside none but himself alone,</L>
<L>He lookt a little, and did espy</L>
<L>A little house, none else hard by;</L>
<L>To himself he sayes quickly,</L>
<L>To yonder house I will me hy,</L>
<PB REF="9"/>
<L>And ask some vittals for this night,</L>
<L>And harbour while the day be light:</L>
<L>He stepped forth right sturdily,</L>
<L>And to the little house went he:</L>
<L>He knockt a little at the door,</L>
<L>And then went in upon the floor,</L>
<L>He found no creature therein,</L>
<L>Neither to make noise nor din,</L>
<L>But a silly and aged wife,</L>
<L>In chastity had led her life:</L>
<L>He sayes, Dame, for Saint Iuly,</L>
<L>This night let me have harbury,</L>
<L>And als some vittals till the morn,</L>
<L>For him that was in <HI>Bethlehem</HI> born;</L>
<L>She sayes, to such meat as I have</L>
<L>Ye're welcome, part thereof receive,</L>
<L>She set him down, and gave him meat,</L>
<L>Even of the best that she could get,</L>
<L>And prayed him to make good chear,</L>
<L>For you are very welcome here;</L>
<L>I know ye are of far Countrie,</L>
<L>For ye are séemly for to sée.</L>
<L>Tell me your name in charitie,</L>
<L>And do not it deny to me:</L>
<L>He sayes, <HI>Dissawar</HI> they call me,</L>
<L>So was I call'd in my countrie:</L>
<L>She sayes, <HI>Dissawar,</HI> wo is me,</L>
<L>That is a poor name verilie</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Dissawar,</HI> you shall not be,</L>
<L>For good help you shall have of me:</L>
<L>I have a son no children mo,</L>
<L>Who each day to the School doth go:</L>
<L>If ye will bide still here with me,</L>
<PB REF="9"/>
<L>To him full welcome will ye be;</L>
<L>And dayly you and he together</L>
<L>May go to School and learn each other;</L>
<L>He sayes, good Dame, God you foryield,</L>
<L>For here I get of you good bield.</L>
<L>As he and she was thus talkand,</L>
<L>In comes her son even at her hand:</L>
<L>Good Dame, he sayes, my mother dear,</L>
<L>Who's this that ye have gotten here,</L>
<L>This is a Clark of far Countrie,</L>
<L>Would fain go to the School with thée;</L>
<L>He sayes dear welcome mot he be,</L>
<L>For I have got good companie.</L>
<L>And then they past to their supper,</L>
<L>For his sake had the better chear.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Dissawar</HI> fair of face,</L>
<L>After supper said the grace.</L>
<L>And quickly to their beds went they,</L>
<L>And sléeped till it was near day,</L>
<L>And then the morn right airly rose,</L>
<L>And put upon them all their cloaths,</L>
<L>They went to School right hastilie,</L>
<L>By that time they could day-light sée.</L>
<L>Into the School the Master came,</L>
<L>And asked at <HI>Dissawar</HI> his name:</L>
<L>He sayes, <HI>Dissawar</HI> they call me,</L>
<L>So was I cal'd in my Countrie.</L>
<L>The Master said, now <HI>Dissawar,</HI></L>
<L>Thou shalt want neither meat nor laire:</L>
<L>When ever thou needest, come to me,</L>
<L>And I shall make you good supplie.</L>
<L>Great skill of learning before he had</L>
<L>Into the Country where he was bred.</L>
<PB REF="10"/>
<L>He had not been a moneth there,</L>
<L>Into the School even little maire,</L>
<L>But the Steward unto the King</L>
<L>Of <HI>Dissawar</HI> had perceiving:</L>
<L>He did set well his courtesie,</L>
<L>His nature and his great beautie;</L>
<L>Into his heart he greatly thought</L>
<L>In service to have him, if he might</L>
<L>The Steward to the Wife is gone,</L>
<L>And sayes, God save you fair Madam,</L>
<L>Where got ye this child so fair,</L>
<L>That to this Lodging makes repair?</L>
<L>Sir, they do call him <HI>Dissawar,</HI></L>
<L>And ay hes done since he came here:</L>
<L>He is my joy, he is my heart,</L>
<L>For he and I shall never part;</L>
<L>He sayes, Madam, that may not be,</L>
<L>He must go to the Court with me:</L>
<L>She sayes, Sir, its against my will,</L>
<L>If ye will let him here stay still.</L>
<L>The Steward took <HI>Dissawar</HI> fair of face,</L>
<L>And brought him to the Kings Grace.</L>
<L>He had not been a moneth there,</L>
<L>Into service or little maire,</L>
<L>But he was lov'd of old and young,</L>
<L>As he had been a Prince or King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The King he had a Daughter fair,</L>
<L>And no moe bairns she was his Heir,</L>
<L>She was by name call'd <HI>Lillian,</HI></L>
<L>Of fairer forsooth I read of nane:</L>
<L>Not the Noble <HI>French</HI> Quéen,</L>
<L>Nor yet the Lady <HI>Pelicane,</HI></L>
<L>Nor yet <HI>Helen</HI> that fair Ladie,</L>
<PB REF="10"/>
<L>Nor yet the true <HI>Philippie,</HI></L>
<L>Nor yet the Lady <HI>Christaline</HI></L>
<L>Was not so fair as <HI>Lillian,</HI></L>
<L>This lusty Lady <HI>Lillian</HI></L>
<L>Choos'd him to be her Chamberlane,</L>
<L>Of which the Steward was full wo,</L>
<L>That he so soon should part him fro:</L>
<L>Yet would not say nay to <HI>Lillian,</HI></L>
<L>Of which the Lady was right fain,</L>
<L>And entred him in her service,</L>
<L>For he was both leill, true and wise:</L>
<L>He brake her bread, and made good chear,</L>
<L>Filled the cup, the wine that bare:</L>
<L>She took such comfort then of him,</L>
<L>She lov'd him better nor all her kin.</L>
<L>Aside she call'd him on a day,</L>
<L>And thus unto him she did say,</L>
<L>Now tell me <HI>Dissawar</HI> for charitie,</L>
<L>Into what Country born was ye?</L>
<L>He said I'm of a far Countrie,</L>
<L>My father's a man of a low degrée:</L>
<L>I cannot trust, said she, by the rood,</L>
<L>But you are come of noble blood:</L>
<L>For I know by your courtisie,</L>
<L>And by your wonder fair bodie,</L>
<L>That ye are come of noble blood,</L>
<L>This is my reason, by the rood,</L>
<L>Madam, by that ye may well ken,</L>
<L>That I am come of sober men.</L>
<L><HI>Dissawar,</HI> my little flower,</L>
<L>I wish thou were my paramour:</L>
<L>God sen I had thee to be King,</L>
<L>That I might wed you with a King.</L>
<PB REF="11"/>
<L>In her arms she did him imbrace,</L>
<L>And kist him thrice into that place.</L>
<L>He knéeled down upon his knée,</L>
<L>And thanked that Lady heartilie:</L>
<L>He said, Lady, God you foreyéeld,</L>
<L>That ye should love so poor a child;</L>
<L>And I now, Lady, while I die,</L>
<L>Love you again most heartilie,</L>
<L>Within his heart he was right glad</L>
<L>And he did think mair then he said.</L>
<L>Soon after that this Lady fair,</L>
<L>Said anone to <HI>Dissawar,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Dissawar,</HI> I do you pray,</L>
<L>Cast that name from you away;</L>
<L>Call you <HI>Hector</HI> or <HI>Oliver</HI></L>
<L>Ye are so fair without compare:</L>

<L>If ye will have no other name,</L>
<L>Call you a Squire to the King,</L>

<L>She laugh'd, and once or twice him kist,</L>
<L>And to her Ladies then she past,</L>
<L>And <HI>Dissawar</HI> was very glad,</L>
<L>For the joy he of the Lady had,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So it befell upon a day,</L>
<L>His Father to his Mother did say,</L>
<L>I think right long for to hear tell</L>
<L>Of my fair son <HI>Roswall:</HI></L>
<L>I think so long I cannot sleep,</L>
<L>With that the Quéen began to wéep,</L>
<L>Who said, good Sir, for charitie,</L>
<L>Let some be sent him for to sée:</L>
<L>It is long since he from us went,</L>
<L>Perchance his Gold is now all spent.</L>
<L>As the King his Father was to send,</L>
<L>There came Messengers even at hand</L>
<L>With letters from that noble King,</L>
<L>Which made him glad in every thing.</L>
<L>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey beguiled were both, so</L>
<L>That none of them the case did know:</L>
<L>The King had written on this manner,</L>
<L>Desiring his Son to his Daughter,</L>
<L>The King his Father was right glad,</L>
<L>That such a marriage should be made;</L>
<L>Therefore he every way consented,</L>
<L>Even as the King by writ had sent it;</L>
<L>An answer to him he did send,</L>
<L>When he the wedding would intend,</L>
<L>That he might send Lords of that Countrie</L>
<L>To bear witnesse to that marriage frée.</L>
<L>The Messengers went home again,</L>
<L>And told their King what they had done;</L>
<PB REF="12"/>
<L>And then anone without delay</L>
<L>Appointed was the Marriage day:</L>
<L>Who sent word to the noble King,</L>
<L>And he without more tarrying,</L>
<L>Sent to solemnize that day,</L>
<L>An Earle and Lusty Lords tway:</L>
<L>With them went two lusty Knights,</L>
<L>And many a gallant Squire wight:</L>
<L>The King of <HI>Bealm</HI> caus'd make a cry,</L>
<L>Three dayes before the marriage day,</L>
<L>To come and Iust a course of Wier,</L>
<L>Before me and my Queen full dear,</L>
<L>To see who best will undertake,</L>
<L>To Iust then for his Ladies sake.</L>
<L>But when to <HI>Lillian</HI> it was told,</L>
<L>Wit ye well her heart was cold;</L>
<L>For she lov'd none but <HI>Dissawar.</HI></L>
<L>Who, went and told him lesse and mair,</L>
<L>Said, at yon Iusting you must be,</L>
<L>For to Iust for your Ladie:</L>
<L>And if ye will not Iust for me,</L>
<L>Iust for your Love where ere she be:</L>
<L>He saith, Lady, by my good fay,</L>
<L>I nere was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed with such a play,</L>
<L>For I had rather be at hunting,</L>
<L>Then singing, dancing, or at Iusting:</L>
<L>Yet I shall stand by you Lady,</L>
<L>To sée who bears away the gree.</L>
<L>And so they parted on that night:</L>
<L>And on the morn when it was light,</L>
<L><HI>Dissawar</HI> got up his way,</L>
<L>Went to the Forrest be it was day:</L>
<L>His hounds leading into his hand,</L>
<PB REF="12"/>
<L>Full well triping at his command.</L>
<L>And when he came to the Forrest,</L>
<L>He looked East, and looked West,</L>
<L>He looked over the bents brown,</L>
<L>Where he saw neither house nor town,</L>
<L>The Myrle and Mavese shouted shrile,</L>
<L>The Sun blinked on every hill:</L>
<L>In his heart he had great rejoycing</L>
<L>Of the birds full swéet singing:</L>
<L>He looked down upon the spray,</L>
<L>When it was nine hours of the day,</L>
<L>And saw a little space him fra,</L>
<L>A Knight coming, with him no mae,</L>
<L>Riding on a milk-white stéed,</L>
<L>And all milk-white was his wéed,</L>
<L>To <HI>Dissawar</HI> he came ridand,</L>
<L>And lighted down even at his hand,</L>
<L>And said, anone, my full swéet thing,</L>
<L>I must be drest in your cloathing:</L>
<L>Take you my armour and my stéed,</L>
<L>And dresse you all into my wéed:</L>
<L>And to you Iusting ye must faire,</L>
<L>To win you praise and honour mair:</L>
<L>When ye have done come ye to me,</L>
<L>Of Vennisoun ye shall have plentie.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Dissawar</HI> armed him quickly:</L>
<L>The Knight him helped that stood by:</L>
<L>He stoutly lap upon his steed,</L>
<L>And ran Lances through the Mied,</L>
<L>Till he came to the Iusting-place,</L>
<L>He saw his Mistres face to face,</L>
<L>And he saw many Ladies gay,</L>
<L>And many Lords in rich array,</L>
<PB REF="13"/>
<L>And he saw many a lustie Knight,</L>
<L>Iusting before him in his sight:</L>
<L>He rade unto the Iusting place,</L>
<L>Where Knights encountred face to face,</L>
<L>And many sadles toom'd he there,</L>
<L>Both of Knights and many a Squyer:</L>
<L>All men wondred what he was,</L>
<L>That of Iusting had such praise:</L>
<L>The Ladies heart was wonder sair</L>
<L>And said, alace for <HI>Dissawar.</HI></L>
<L>Why would he not tarry with me,</L>
<L>This Noble justing for to see:</L>
<L>And when the Iusting was near done,</L>
<L>Then he beheld the steward soon,</L>
<L>His héels turn upward there he made,</L>
<L>All that him saw were sore afraid.</L>
<L>Then he unto the Forrest ran,</L>
<L>As light as ever did a man:</L>
<L>The King cry'd with voice on hie,</L>
<L>Go take you Knight, bring him to me,</L>
<L>And whoso brings him to my hand,</L>
<L>Shall have an Earldome of land:</L>
<L>But all for nought, it was in vain,</L>
<L>For to the woods he rade again,</L>
<L>Delivered his Armour and his steed,</L>
<L>And brest himself in his own weed:</L>
<L>The Lord had taken him Vennisoun,</L>
<L>And homeward with them made he bown,</L>
<L>As for help desired none he,</L>
<L>Presented them to his Ladie.</L>
<L>She sayes, now wherefore <HI>Dissawar</HI></L>
<L>Beguil'd ye me in this manner?</L>
<L>He answered, my Lady dear,</L>
<PB REF="13"/>
<L>Why say ye that unto me here?</L>
<L>Wherefore shall I come to Iusting?</L>
<L>I have no skill of such a thing.</L>
<L>She sayes a Knight with a white stéed,</L>
<L>And all milk-white was his wéed,</L>
<L>He hath born away the grée,</L>
<L>Of him is spoken great plentie:</L>
<L>And if ye bide the morn with me,</L>
<L>Ye peradventure shall him sée,</L>
<L>I shall do so, said he, Madam,</L>
<L>The morn I will not passe from home,</L>
<L>Then <HI>Lillian</HI> to her Ladies went,</L>
<L>Past to their supper incontinent:</L>
<L>And on the morn right timously,</L>
<L>He did rise up be he might see,</L>
<L>And forth unto the Forrest went,</L>
<L>After the night was fully spent:</L>
<L>When that he came to those woods gréen,</L>
<L>The place where he before had béen;</L>
<L>Vnder the shadow of a trée</L>
<L>He laid him down right privatlie.</L>
<L>The birds did sing with pleasant voice,</L>
<L>He thought himself in Paradice,</L>
<L>And to bear part, for joy sang he</L>
<L>Even for the love of his Ladie,</L>
<L>How she lov'd him her Paramour,</L>
<L>And she of all the world the flower:</L>
<L>For pleasure of the weather fair,</L>
<L>So clear and pleasant was the air,</L>
<L>His heart was light on leaf on trée,</L>
<L>When that he thought on his Lady.</L>
<L>He looked then over an hill,</L>
<L>And saw a Knight coming him till,</L>
<PB REF="14"/>
<L>Having a red shield and a red spear,</L>
<L>And all red shined his gear.</L>
<L>To <HI>Dissawar</HI> he came full soon,</L>
<L>And at his hand he lighted down,</L>
<L>And said, Sir, take this horse of mine,</L>
<L>And all my Armour good and fine:</L>
<L>To the Iusting in haste ride ye,</L>
<L>The gracious God your guide be:</L>
<L>And soon to him he reacht a Spear,</L>
<L>Which he did take withoutten fear:</L>
<L>He then did ride forth merrilie,</L>
<L>And soon his Lady can he sée,</L>
<L>And she was cloathed all in white,</L>
<L>To look on her was great delight:</L>
<L>He made the Lady full gay halsing,</L>
<L>And then he went to the Iusting:</L>
<L>And if he Iusted well before,</L>
<L>Better that day by fifteen score.</L>
<L>He hunted the Knights here and there,</L>
<L>Even as the hound doth hunt the Hare,</L>
<L>And many Knights he bare to ground,</L>
<L>And some of them got their déeds wound.</L>
<L>Of the Steward he got a sight,</L>
<L>And on his arse he made him light,</L>
<L>And then unto the Forrest ran,</L>
<L>As light as ever did a man.</L>
<L>The King cryed with voice on hie,</L>
<L>Go take yon Knight, bring him to me,</L>
<L>And whoso brings him to my hand</L>
<L>Shall have an Earldome of land:</L>
<L>But all for nought it was in vain,</L>
<L>For to the Woods he rade again.</L>
<L>When he came there the Knight he leugh,</L>
<PB REF="14"/>
<L>Have I not Vennisoun enough?</L>
<L>Ye have béen at the field all day,</L>
<L>And I at hunting and at play,</L>
<L>Then <HI>Dissawar</HI> gave him his steed,</L>
<L>His shield, his armour, and his weed:</L>
<L>His steed was all of apple-gray,</L>
<L>None better was, I dare well say.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Dissawar</HI> went home quickly,</L>
<L>With a white Hind to his Lady,</L>
<L>When he came home, as I heard tell,</L>
<L>She greatly did at him marvell</L>
<L>That he came not to the Iusting:</L>
<L>Lady, grive not at such a thing.</L>
<L>She sayes, a Knight with a gray stéed,</L>
<L>And all red shined his weed,</L>
<L>This day hath born away the grée,</L>
<L>Of him is spoken great plentie:</L>
<L>And I have ever in my thought</L>
<L>That it was you the deed hath wrought.</L>
<L>I pray, Madam, trust no such thing,</L>
<L>For I no skill have of Iusting.</L>
<L>She sayes the morn go not away,</L>
<L>Because it is the hindmost day:</L>
<L>But <HI>Dissawar</HI> full soon the morn</L>
<L>Got up and blew his hunting horn,</L>
<L>And went unto the Forrest soon</L>
<L>With hounds and ratches of renown,</L>
<L>And there he had great comforting</L>
<L>Of all the birds full swéet singing,</L>
<L>And then he looked up full swyth,</L>
<L>He saw a sight which made him blyth,</L>
<L>A Knight upon a stalward Steed,</L>
<L>And glittring Gold was all his wéed:</L>
<PB REF="15"/>
<L>His shield was red, his armour green,</L>
<L>Ov'r all the land it might be seen.</L>
<L>To <HI>Dissawar</HI> he came full soon,</L>
<L>And at his hand he lighted down,</L>
<L>And said, Sir, take this horse of mine,</L>
<L>And all my armour good and fine:</L>
<L>To the Iusting in haste ride ye,</L>
<L>The Gracious God your guide be:</L>
<L>And even so soon as he came there,</L>
<L>He saw his Lady, that was so fair:</L>
<L>And all the weed that she did wear,</L>
<L>In glittering red gold did appear,</L>
<L>He at his Lady did cast a King,</L>
<L>Then past he on to the Iusting;</L>
<L>He rade among them with such force,</L>
<L>That he dang down both man and horse:</L>
<L>Out through the field when that he ran,</L>
<L>At each stroak he dang down a man.</L>
<L>Sir <HI>Ronald</HI> and Sir <HI>Oliver</HI></L>
<L>In their Iusting made no such steir,</L>

<L>Both horse and man on the ground lay,</L>
<L>And of his ribs were broken tway.</L>
<L>Then to the Forrest he rade full soon,</L>
<L>When that the Iusting was all done;</L>
<L>As swift as <HI>Falcon</HI> of his flight</L>
<L>Vpon a bird when he doth light.</L>
<L>The King cryed with voice full shrill</L>
<L>Go take you Knight, bring him me till;</L>
<L>And whoso brings him to me here,</L>
<L>Shall have my land and daughter dear,</L>
<L>But all for nought, it was in vain,</L>

<L>For to the woods he rade again,</L>

<L>Then came the other two Knights in hy.</L>
<L>The same two Knights we spake of aire,</L>

<L>From prison you delivered us,</L>

<L>We promised to you again,</L>

<L>We should perform the same with spéed.</L>
<L>The morn the marriage should be</L>

<L>But therefore do thou nothing fear,</L>
<L>The Brides bed he shall not come near.</L>
<L>They took their leave withoutten mair,</L>

<L>And when that they were coming home</L>
<L>From the Iusting every one,</L>
<L>He went unto his Lady gent,</L>

<L>Are ye, <HI>Dissawar,</HI> welcome to me,</L>

<L>But yet I must forgive you soon</L>
<L>Of all that ever you have done,</L>

<L>This day hath born away the grée</L>

<L>If to my Father the truth ye tell,</L>

<L>I shall do that, my Lady bright,</L>

<L>Then she the morn right airly rose,</L>
<L>And put upon her all her cloaths,</L>
<L>Vnto the King then is she gone,</L>

<L>Then said he, <HI>Lillian,</HI> what would ye?</L>

<L>I ask no more at you, Father.</L>
<L>That asking I do tell thée plain,</L>
<L>Is not befitting for thy train:</L>
