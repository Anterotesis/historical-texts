<P><HI>AETH</HI> is a City in <HI>Hanault,</HI> seated on the Ri∣ver <HI>Dendre,</HI> 14 Miles North from <HI>Mons,</HI> as many South from <HI>Audenard,</HI> and about 20 South West from <HI>Brussels.</HI> It is a place of good Trade for Linnen, and by reason of the Situation near the borders of these three Provinces of <HI>Hanault, Flanders, Brabant,</HI> it hath been at several times well Fortified, especially by the <HI>French,</HI> after they had taken it in the Year 1667, for it be∣ing granted to them by the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chappelle,</HI> Mounsieur <HI>Vauban</HI> was set to Work, and by great cost it was made a most regular Fortification; which made this most advanc'd Frontier a place of great Strength. The <HI>French</HI> was obliged to restore at the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen;</HI> and belonged to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> until this present Year.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 17th, <HI>Aeth</HI> was Invested on all sides to the 27th of the same Month in this manner.</P>
<P>The Troops which composed the Army of the Mareschal <HI>de Catinat</HI> and above 20000 Pioneers, being arriv'd before <HI>Aeth</HI> the 17th of <HI>May</HI> and the Posts about it having been posessed, they began to Work on the Lines of Circumvallation. The same Day the Army of the Mareschal Duke <HI>de Villeroy</HI> made a motion and stretcht it self as far as <HI>Ligne.</HI> The Countess <HI>de Roeux</HI> Wife of the Governour of <HI>Aeth</HI> and greatest part of the Women and Maids having obtain'd permission of the said Mareschal (whose Army made the Siege) went out of the said City. The 18th they began to work on the Lines and to make Bridges over the <HI>Dendre.</HI> The Mareschals <HI>de Villeroy</HI> and <HI>Catinat</HI> with Mounsieur <HI>Vauban</HI> and other general Officers went to view the Ground towards the Abby of <HI>Cambron,</HI> and it was Resolved to put into the said Abby 6 Battallions and a Regiment of Dragoons with order to entrench themselves, and to clap other Troops in <HI>Lens</HI> in order to shut up the passage from the Enemy. The 19th they continued to bring all things necessary for the Siege of the Place, and the Enemies continued to make a very great fire with Cannon almost without any effect. The 20th the Mareschal Duke <HI>de Villeroy</HI> left <HI>Ligne</HI> with his Army, and went and encampt at <HI>Osticke</HI> where the General Quarters were; the Right∣wing at <HI>Papigny</HI> and the Left at <HI>Hamede.</HI> The Mareschal Duke <HI>de Boufflers</HI> having had Advice that the Prince <HI>de Vaudemont</HI> had moved the first Line of the Army he Commanded as far as <HI>Leu∣beck</HI> upon the <HI>Senne</HI> a little on this side <HI>Hall,</HI> made also his Army advance as far as <HI>Neaville</HI> beyond <HI>Soignies.</HI> In the Morning the Mareschals <HI>de Villeroy</HI> and <HI>de Catinat</HI> made a review of their Armies, and after sent them out to Forage.</P>
<P>The Lines of Circumvallation being finished, they sent the Pioneers home again to their Houses; the same Day about 8 of the Clock at Night they opened the Trenches by two several ways on the side of <HI>Brussels</HI> Gate; the Count <HI>de Tesse</HI> Lieutenant General mounted on the Right with Mounsieur <HI>de Salis</HI> Brigadier and the Sieur <HI>de Puy Vauban</HI> chief Ingineer and two Battallions of the Regiment of <HI>Po∣veton</HI> and of <HI>la Marche,</HI> they made about 1500 Fathom of Trench, and joined in the Morning the two Attacks by a Parallel of 200 Paces from the place; all there works having been made and brought to an entire degree of Perfection without the loss of one Man. The 21d the Mareschal <HI>de Villeroy</HI> made a movement of his Army, and advanced the Left-wing towards the River <HI>Den∣dre</HI> over which he cast several Bridges. That Evening he sent a great Detachment to learn News of the Enemy; The same Day a Convoy of 10 pieces of Cannon and 400 Waggons laden with Am∣munition and with the Baggage of the Officers was attackt at the Valley of <HI>Maude</HI> two Leagues from <HI>Tournay,</HI> from whence it was sent by a part of the Troops of <HI>Bavaria</HI> consisting of 200 chosen Men Horse and Foot; but a party of the Convoy being advanced at the noise, charged them with so much Vigour that the Commander of the Party was killed with eighteen of his Men and the rest put to flight without any other loss on our side than of three Soldiers Killed, and a Lieutenant of the <HI>Swiss</HI> Wounded, and so the Convoy arrived safe in the Camp.</P>
<P>On the 22th The <HI>French</HI> open'd their Trenches before <HI>Aeth,</HI> and were advanced to the Glacis of the Counterscarp; the same Day their Cannon began to play upon the Town: The Besieged made a Sally with good success, killing several of the Enemy, and De∣molishing some of their Works, after which our Men retired in good Order.</P>
<P>The Night following the Marquess <HI>de Vin</HI> Lieutenant-General Mounted the Trenches with the Marquess <HI>de Vilray</HI> Brigadier and 2 Battallions of <HI>Anjou</HI>'s and one of <HI>Tournay</HI>'s. The Count <HI>de Garcey</HI> Mareschal <HI>de Camp</HI> mounted on the Left with 2 Battalions of <HI>Humiers</HI> and that of <HI>Vexin,</HI> they pushed on the 2 Trenches within 200 Fathom of the Place, where they were joined the 23th by a Parallel.</P>
<P>The same Day the Marquess <HI>de Constans,</HI> who had Orders to throw himself into <HI>Aeth</HI> to command there, was taken Prisoner by the Troops of the Mareschal <HI>de Villeroy,</HI> and he was conducted the 24th. to <HI>Mons.</HI> In the Evening they had Advice that the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> observing that the Post he had taken at <HI>Deynse</HI> was of no use to him had abandoned it, and made his Army repass through <HI>Ghent</HI> on its way to joyn that of the King of <HI>England,</HI> taking his way behind the great <HI>Skelt.</HI></P>
<P>Major General <HI>Fagell</HI> who camped near <HI>Newport</HI> came with 12 Bar∣tallions to possess the Post at <HI>Deynse,</HI> upon this News the Marquess <HI>de Crequi</HI> received Orders to set forward with his Detachment from those that were upon the <HI>Laye,</HI> to approach the Army of the Mareschal <HI>de Villeroy</HI> at his Camp of <HI>Osticke.</HI> The Marquess <HI>de Montreville</HI> came in his room from <HI>Courtray,</HI> with 20 Battallions. The Mareschal <HI>de Boufflers</HI> made at the same time his left Wing to advance near to <HI>Cambron,</HI> so that the Three Armies were in a readiness to joyn in a few Hours time when there should be occasion for it. The 24th. in the Evening the Trench was mounted on the Right by the Marquess <HI>de Lorray</HI> Lieutenant Ge∣neral, and Mounsieur <HI>Lee</HI> Brigadier, with a Battallion of <HI>Artois,</HI> of one <HI>Catinat,</HI> and one of <HI>Berry;</HI> and on the Left by the Marquess <HI>de Clerem∣beaut</HI> Mareschal de Camp, with 2 Battallions of <HI>Vermandois,</HI> and of one <HI>Beauquis.</HI> That Night and the next Day they carried on the Trench to the bottom of the Glacis of the Counterscarp. The 25th. at Night the Chevalier <HI>de la Teste</HI> Lieutenant General, and Monsieur <HI>Blegny</HI> Bri∣gadier, mounted the Trench on the Right, with Three Battallions of the Regiment of <HI>Stoapa;</HI> and the Marquess <HI>d'Ʋlpion</HI> on the Left, with a Bat∣tallion of <HI>Stoapa,</HI> and Two of <HI>Salis:</HI> They finished that Night with the Sappe the Communication of the Two Trenches by a Parallel, and they wrought to raise 5 Batteries of 6 Pieces of Cannon each.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 26, The Enemies sent out some Musquetiers, which posted themselves in the Hedges to incommode the Work-men, but they were soon driven away by a Detachment of 200 Men.</P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>de la Tesse</HI> received a Contusion and a Wound on the Side; they lost since the Investure of the Place but 14 or 15 Soldiers, amongst which there were only Two Officers. At Night the Chevalier <HI>de Gossion</HI> Lieutenant General, and the Marquess <HI>de Biron</HI> Brigadier, mounted the Trench on the Right, with 2 Battallions of the Regiment of <HI>Malevrier,</HI> and another; and the Marquess <HI>de Haurtcourt</HI> Mareschal de Camp, with 3 Battallions of <HI>Sarebeck:</HI> That Night they finished the 5 Batteries, and the 27th. at Four of the Clock in the Morn∣ing they began to Fire from the Batteries upon the right Face of the Bastion of <HI>Limbargh,</HI> and against the half Moon of <HI>Brabancon,</HI> and the rest against the half Moon of <HI>Cambron,</HI> and the left Face of the same Bastion of <HI>Limbargh.</HI></P>
<P>On the 28th Brigadier <HI>Lumly</HI> being sent out with a Detachment, met with a <HI>French</HI> Party of 200 Carabineers and 150 Hussars, Commanded by the Colonel of the Hussars, with whom having engaged, the Co∣lonel with a Captain and 20 Men were brought in Prisoners, besides several killed.</P>
<P>The 29th The Army Commanded by <HI>Villeroy</HI> and <HI>Boufflers</HI> were very near each other, and advantageously Posted to cover the Siege, which was carried on by <HI>Catinat.</HI> The 30th Sir <HI>William Russell</HI> a Captain in Colonel <HI>Coy</HI>'s Regiment, Commanding an advanced Party in his Majesty's Army, Attackt a party of the Enemy, and took a Colonel and a great many Prisoners.</P>
<P>On the 31st. The <HI>French</HI> Carried on their Trenches, and begun to bat∣ter the Works of the Town, but with the loss of several Officers; Mon∣sieur <HI>Vauban</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King's principal Ingeneer received a Confusion on his Thigh by a Musquet Shot. On the 1st of <HI>June</HI> the Garison of <HI>Aeth</HI> made a very good Defence, having opened their Siuices which drowned several of the Enemy, and several Officers in carrying on their Trenches, though they endeavoured by their Bombs and Cannons to destroy its effects: There were several Bombs throw'd into Town which set several Houses on Fire; but were presently Extinguished.</P>
<P>On the 2 of <HI>June</HI> his Majesty was Encamped at <HI>Genap,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> at <HI>Deynss, Villeroy</HI> and <HI>Boufflers</HI> were at their Camps at <HI>Lessines</HI> and <HI>Silly,</HI> not far from <HI>Aeth:</HI> The 3d a person who got out of <HI>Aeth</HI> re∣ported the <HI>French</HI> took a Half-moon after two Repulses and loss of Men, and that there Bombs at last had ruined the Sluices, which had much in convenienced the Besieged, putting several of the Streets in the Town under Water; but at the same time broke the Enemies Bridges of Com∣munication. Monsieur <HI>Negrini</HI> Lieutenant-General and second Ingeneer of <HI>France</HI> was Killed.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 4, One part of the Right of the Bastion of <HI>Limburg</HI> fell 14 or 15 Yards in length, and we shot from the Breaches of these two Bastions to render it more easy, and cast in Faggots to fill up the Ditch. They perpetually shot from two Batteries of 12 Morters each, which were placed upon the Cover'd-way before the <HI>Demilune,</HI> to hinder the Be∣sieged from retrenching behind their Bastions. 5 in the Morning the Ditch was almost fill'd up, both by Earth and Faggots, in such manner that the Breach became so even that 30 Men might Mount by the Basti∣on of <HI>Namur,</HI> and 20 or 25 by that of <HI>Limburg.</HI></P>
<P>The Mareschal <HI>Catinat</HI> Commanded 20 Companies to Attack the place under the Command of Count <HI>de Mercia,</HI> with an assurance that they could not miss of carrying the place by Assault. But at two of the Clock the Besieged being afraid of a Storm, and being without hope of any succour beat a Parly, and demanded to Capitulate: They sent Hostages at 4 of the Clock; and a little after the Capitulation was agreed upon, in the following Terms.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>THat the Besieged should deli∣ver a Gate to the</HI> French <HI>at</HI> 6 <HI>in the Morning upon the</HI> 6th <HI>instant; and upon the</HI> 7th <HI>That the Garrison should go out at</HI> 10 <HI>in the Morning by the Breach, with Arms and Baggage, Drums beating, Colours flying, but without either Cannon or Mortar, and to be conducted in</HI> 3 <HI>Days to</HI> Den∣dermond, <HI>and not to</HI> Brussels <HI>or</HI> Au∣denard <HI>as they had requested.</HI></ITEM>

<P>These Articles were executed; the 7th the Garison marched out to the Number of 2500 Men, with the Governour the Count <HI>de Reaux,</HI> and next to him the Prince of <HI>Anhault</HI> at the Head of them, and other Prin∣cipal Officers, who saluted Mareschal <HI>Catinat,</HI> and the Duke <HI>de Tho∣louze</HI> as they passed along. The five Hostages for the Prisoners of <HI>Na∣mur</HI> were delivered, to wit the Prince of <HI>Chimay</HI> Knight of the Golden Fleece, The Sieur <HI>de Catoire</HI> Lieutenant-Colonel, a Major and two Cap∣tains, and were the same Day conducted to <HI>Valenciennes.</HI> Above one half of the <HI>Italian</HI> Battallion Deserted and put themselves into the Kings Ser∣vice: So the City of <HI>Aeth</HI> one of the strongest and best Walled places of <HI>Europe</HI> was taken in 13 Days after the Trenches opened, with the loss only of 50 Soldiers, and the Sieur <HI>Courtin</HI> Ingenier Killed, The Sieur <HI>Frene</HI> Gentleman of the Horse to Mareschal Duke <HI>de Villeroy,</HI> the Sieur <HI>Emonia</HI> Captain of the Artillery Carriages dead of their Wounds. 150 Wounded, among whom was a Captain of Granadiers and 7 In∣gineers,</P>
