<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hereas it is found by Experience, That Traffique with Infidels and Barbarous Nations not in Amity with Vs, and who are not holden by any League or Treaty, cannot be carried on without the Establishment of Forts and Factories in places convenient, the maintenance whereof requires so great and constant Expence, that it cannot be otherwise defrayed, then by Managing the whole Trade by a Ioynt Stock; We in Our Royal Wisdom taking the same into Our serious Consideration, and more especially having found by experience, That the whole Trade of the Coast of <HI>Guiny, Buiny</HI> and <HI>Angola,</HI> and other parts and places of <HI>Africa,</HI> so much importing our Ser∣vice, and the Enriching of this Our Kingdom, was very much abated, and attempted to be Ingrossed by Fo∣reigners, and in eminent danger to be utterly lost, and taken from Vs, and Our loving Subjects, not onely by Foreign Force, but by the Violence and Inconstancy of the Heathen Natives: For the Recovery and Preservation whereof, We were Graciously pleased to encourage and invite Our loving Subjects to Raise a Ioynt Stock to be used and imployed therein: And in consideration there∣of, and for the better Securing of such as should come in and be concerned in the said Ioynt Stock and Trade, We did by Our Letters Patents under Our Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> bearing date the Seven and twentieth day of <HI>September,</HI> in the Four and twen∣tieth year of Our Reign, Grant unto several of Our loving Subjects, the whole entire and onely Trade into and from <HI>Africa,</HI> from the Port of <HI>Sally</HI> in <HI>South Barbary</HI> inclusive, to the Cape <HI>de Bona Esperanza</HI> inclusive, with all the Islands near adjoyning to those Coasts, and comprehended within the Limits aforesaid, and did Incorporate them by the name of <HI>The Royal <HI>African</HI> Company of <HI>England;</HI></HI> And the said Company having raised a very great Stock sufficient to Manage the Trade thereof, have since, at their great Expence and Charge, Fortified and Setled divers Garisons, Forts and Factories, by which means they have so Secured the said Trade, that the same doth now begin to flourish, and if not disturbed, is likely to be further improved to the great benefit of this Our Kingdom; Nevertheless, We are Informed by the humble Petition of the said Company, That divers of Our Subjects in several of Our Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> who are not Members of the said Company, nor any ways concerned in their Stock, do endeavour to reap the Benefit and Fruit thereof; and to that end have already sent several Ships into those parts to Trade, and are providing more, the which if it should be permitted, and not strictly and presently prevented, will disable the said Company from supporting the great Charge of maintaining the said Forts, Garisons and Factories, and consequently, unavoidably occasion the loss of the whole Trade of those Countreys: Wherefore for remedy thereof We have thought fit, with Advice of Our Privy Council, to Publish and Declare Our Royal Will and Pleasure to be, And We do hereby strictly Prohibit and Forbid all and every of Our Subjects whatsoever, Except the said Royal Company and their Successours, at any time or times hereafter, to send or Navigate any Ship or Ships, Vessel or Vessels, or Exercise any Trade from any of Our Plantations, Dominions, or Coun∣treys in <HI>America,</HI> to any of the Parts or Coasts of <HI>Africa,</HI> from <HI>Sally</HI> to <HI>Cape de Bona Esperanza,</HI> or any of the Islands near thereunto, as aforesaid, or from thence to carry any <HI>Negro</HI> Servants, Gold, Elephants Teeth, or any other Goods or Merchandizes of the Product or Manufacture of the said Places, to any of Our <HI>American</HI> Dominions or Plantations, upon pain of Our high Displea∣sure, and the forfeiture and loss of the said <HI>Negro's,</HI> Gold, Elephants Teeth, and all other Goods and Merchandizes, and the Ships or Vessels which shall bring or carry the same. And We do hereby also strictly Require and Command all Our Governours, Deputy-Governours, Admirals, Vice-Admirals, Generals, Iudges of Our Courts of Admiralty, Commanders of Our Forts and Castles, Captains of Our Royal Ships, Iustices of the Peace, Provost-Marshals, Marshals, Comptrollers, Collectors of Our Customs, Wayters, Searchers, and all other Our Officers and Ministers Civil and Military, by Sea or Land, in every of Our said <HI>American</HI> Dominions or Plantations, to take effectual care, That no person or persons whatsoever within their respective Limits or Iurisdictions (except the said Company and their Successours) do send or Navigate any Ships or Vessels, or Exercise any Trade from any of Our said Dominions or Plantations, to any part of the said Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> within the Limits aforesaid, or from thence to Import any <HI>Negro</HI> Servants, Gold, Elephants Teeth, or other Goods of the Product of any of those Parts, into any of Our said Dominions or Plantations in <HI>America;</HI> And if any person or persons shall presume to act or do in any wise contrary to this Our Royal Proclamation, to the end Our Will and Pleasure herein may be the better observed, We do further Will, Require, and strictly Command all Our said Governours, Deputy-Governours, Admirals, Vice-Admirals, Generals, Iudges of Our Court of Admiralty, Commanders of Our Forts and Castles, Captains of Our Royal Ships, Iustices of the Peace, Provost-Marshals, Marshals, Comptrollers, Collectors of Our Customs, Wayters, Searchers, and all other Our Officers and Ministers Civil and Military, by Sea or Land, in every of Our said <HI>American</HI> Dominions and Plantations, That as often as need shall require, they be Aiding and Assisting to the said Royal <HI>African</HI> Company, their Successors, Factors, Deputies or Assigns, to Attach, Arrest, Take and Seize all such Ship or Ships, Vessel or Vessels, <HI>Negro</HI> Servants, Gold, Elephants Teeth, or Goods, Wares and Merchandizes, wheresoever they shall be found, for Our Vse, according to Our Royal Charter Granted to the said Company, upon pain of Our high Displeasure, and as they will answer the contrary at their Perils.</P>
