<P>IN our last Avisoes the 20. of <HI>August</HI> (which was devided into 2. parts) wee printed severall passages of the late good successe and Victories of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> against Monsieur <HI>Tilly,</HI> as wee received them from forreine parts, which was published by us with∣out addition or subtraction, &amp; might have given some credit to the same, and deserued a more favorable con∣struction from the most malevolently affected, yet from some it could receive no better approbation, than that all was lyes, and that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was kild, or taken Prisoner, and his Army utterly defeated, as at this houre some shame not impudently to maintaine both heere, and beyond sea at <HI>Antwerp, Bruxels,</HI> and else-where. Wherefore wee doe now publish (as wee have received them from better hands a confirmation of the Truth thereof with some circumstances not in our former, and against which, let the most barking curre open his mouth and say as formerly. God grant him the multiplication of the like victories and good successe untill all his Enemies be vanquished, and a ge∣nerall Peace setled in all the parts of <HI>Germany,</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>From <HI>Stetin</HI> the last of July, <HI>Stilo vet.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He King of Sweden having defeated the Im∣periall regiments, I wrote of in my last, re∣tired againe and satisfied his Campe the best he could, for he knew <HI>Tilly</HI> would not long tarry but come and visite him. But be∣fore <HI>Tilly</HI> came on himselfe hee had sent certaine spies, and sent word to some other he had in the Kings army, to do him such seruice as he thought would assure him of the totall victory over the King. They therefore having undertaken to naile the Ordnance of the Kings Campe, at least towards that part where <HI>Tilly</HI> had espe∣cially commanded it, and by that meanes make the same quite uselesse for the King when he should most have need of it, one of those spies or traytors feeling some remorse in his consci∣ence, discovered the plot to the King and was cause that the other were apprehended. Now <HI>Tilly</HI> hoping things were per∣formed according to his pleasure, beganne to discharge his great Ordnance against the Kings quarter, and having spent aboue 60. shots, yet he did no harme thereby, except that one shot carried away the head from the shoulders of a gentleman that having serued <HI>Tilly</HI> had but a few dayes before beene ta∣ken prisoner, and an arme from another souldier. For the King having put things in order did endure all without making one shot in answere, whereby <HI>Tilly</HI> was the more assured in his hope and resolution, and therefore he sent on some of his troopes to attempt the Kings trenches, where they found no
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>great resistance, which <HI>Tilly</HI> seeing, he supposed he should quickly force and take all that quarter, and to that end advanced and pressed on with his army, when on a sudden the Kings ordnance playd at once amongst the same, and with chaine shot and what other shot else was thought fittest to destructi∣on, made a great butchery of <HI>Tillies</HI> army; And the King at the same instant sent forth <HI>Baudis</HI> with three regiments of Horse, who set so rudely into <HI>Tillies</HI> Currasseers, that he slew a great many and turned them to flight; And it is supposed, that if the King had seconded him with the rest of his army, he would have defeated all his enemies, and few would have es∣caped. Thus <HI>Tilly</HI> having sped no better in this his reuenge, then his Vantgard had done before him, made his retreat, which was not much unlike unto a running away, leaving a number of his men prisoners and more slaine behinde him.</P>
<P>Vpon the 28. of Iuly, my Lord <HI>Marquis Hamilton</HI> arri∣ved with all his fleete joyfully at <HI>Stralsunt,</HI> and all his men were in good health. From thence he dispatched presently a gentleman to the King, and we shall now daily heare of his marching further and of his exploits, which God doe prosper.</P>

<HEAD>Out of another Letter the <HI>2.</HI> of <HI>August.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The plague bginnes to be very furious in Silesia, but yet notwithstanding the Emperour hath given order to make an army there also against the King of Sweden, which shall con∣sist of 15000. men, and the said army is already very strong, and hath this great while besiedged the Swedes in Crossen, but have as yet done them no harme. The King of Sweden hath sent for his forces that were in Silesia to come to him, and thereby it is supposed, that the said King and <HI>Tilly,</HI> who is somewhat retired back, untill his army be reinforced againe, will not part, before they give one another a bloody battell. And at the Citty of Hall, all the water of the ditches about the towne was of late turned all into blood, and hath beene seene by many hundred men of good sort who doe averre the same.
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y"/>Besides this on the last day of Iuly last in the afternoone, there happened in these Countries an exceeding great storme, and especially along the Elbe and about Magdenburgh, where it was so great, that the violence of the wind had certainly carried both <HI>Tilly</HI> himselfe with his tent and pavillion, stan∣ding not very farre from Werben, away into the Elbe, had he not beene rescued and saved by his attendants and Soul∣diers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>From <HI>Dessaw</HI> the <HI>9.</HI> of August.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Tilly</HI> being much displeased at the losse of the Cavalry which were defeated by the King of Sweden on the 27<SUP>th</SUP>. of Iuly, did breath nothing but revenge against Sweden, and therefore having advanceed with his maine army towards the King of Sweden, he had severall enterprises and gave many onsets and assaults against the Kings Campe, which was well fortified and provided, as that King is accustomed to doe wheresoever he doth encampe himselfe. <HI>Tilly</HI> seeing he could not doe any great matter against him by force, did vse also some other plots, to bereave the King of the use of his ordnance, Where∣by the King did mightily annoy him, and having some secret inteligence with some souldiers that served the King, he cor∣rupted them to naile the said ordnance against St. <HI>Iames</HI> day, which day <HI>Tilly</HI> intended to assault the Kings Campe. But one of those souldiers or Traytors discovered the matter unto the King, who keeping it secret, gave order for that dayes worke, on which <HI>Tilly</HI> began to play with his great Ordnance discharging about 80. shots, during which time no answer nor shot was made from the Kings Campe. Therefore <HI>Tilly</HI> sent some of his horse to skirmish, who came under the Kings ord∣nance, but yet were not shot at except by some musquetiers, which the King suffered now and then to give fire against them; <HI>Tilly</HI> seeing no ordnance play against him, supposed that indeed the Kings ordnance had beene nailed, and there∣upon gave a furious assault upon the Campe. Then the King caused his ordnance on a sudden to play through the middest of the Imperialists. And soone after he made a fally with his
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>horse and some of his Infantery, and forced the Imperialists to withdraw into their owne quarters. The two next dayes one after another <HI>Tilly</HI> tryed againe his fortune against the King of Sweden, but he was alwaies so well received, that at last his men had no more minde to come on, but retiring were by the Swedish forces that followed them, especially by the Swedish dragoners so overhastened, that many lost their lives, and left behind them a great number of their Waggons, bag∣gage and peeces of ordnance. <HI>Tilly</HI> retired into Magdenburgh, and what he will now doe is not knowne; he sends for forces to joyne with him, which daily come marching from severall places. The King doth the like; Some thinke <HI>Tilly</HI> will make an attempt about the river of Havel, but long he cannot sub∣sist, for the King hath his provisions and victualls comming to him without any let, where <HI>Tilly</HI> hath none but what is brought very farre downe from Germany to his army, where there is already such a dearth, that a loafe of bread costs a Flo∣rin of gold, which is a french crowne; whereby it is thought <HI>Tilly</HI> must either goe backe againe or tarrying but a while lon∣ger, suffer extreamity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>From <HI>Prage</HI> the <HI>4.</HI> of August Stil nouo.</HEAD>
<P>It is certaine that the King of Sweden hath defeated on the 17. of Iuly last at night, foure whole Imperiall Regiments, slaying a great number, and among the same Collonell <HI>Bern∣stein,</HI> for whom there is heere made great lamentation, but more especially by his Sister, because he was the last of his family. <HI>Montecuculy</HI> we do heare was not present, being then in Silesia; But his regiment was wholly defeated, and parti∣cularly three Companies thereof were all slaine so that not one man thereof escaped. There escaped some few with such a swiftnesse, that they left all they had behind, running away in their shirts, as they came out of their beds. We cannot know the trueth of all particulars, but some of them confesse, they lost at the least about tenne Cornets and foure Ensignes, and withall all their baggage. Since that accident there comes newes of some other encounter and fighting betweene <HI>Tilly</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y"/>and Sweden. But we can seldome understand the certainty of things here, where all is related as the Imperialists will have it: But we perceive so much by their lookes and behaviours, that their last newes are not so good as they doe like and wish it.</P>
<P>Meane while the army that the Emperour hath in Silesia, having not done any thing yet worthy of relation is now to be augmented, and to that end there are sent out of Bohemia, 5000. men, gathered in this kingdome and in Moravia. And there are 5000. Hungarians and Crabats to follow and joyne with the said army, which is commanded by generall <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bach,</HI> who shall bring the same also against the King of Sweden.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Francfort</HI> the <HI>28.</HI> of Iuly. Stil. vet.</HEAD>
<P>The army of the <HI>Landgrave</HI> of Hessen Cassell, doth lay great imposition and desire a constant contribution from the Bishoprick of Hirshfield, using them as the Imperialists and League did and doe use all other Protestants: But whether this will hold, (unlesse the King of Sweden come deeper into Germany) or not, is uncertaine. The Popish Clergy and especially the Abbot of Fulda are fled from the said Hirsh∣field and have carried away all their Ornaments and Church∣stuffe unto Hamelburgh. The Imperiall forces commanded by the Count <HI>Firstenberg</HI> doe now march towards the fore∣named Bishoprick.</P>

<P>There was a fellow in the fashion of a Marchant which comming upon the Longstreet, inquired after and hired a Bush to carry certaine Trunkes for Holland, and having a∣greed for the fraught, he gave speciall charge and inioyned the Shipmaster (by reason of the great charge hee had in his Trunkes) to make up close to the Convoy and the Amuniti∣on Ships of the States lying before Heusdon, at that time there laye about 80. Ships in the River. The said Bush ac∣cordingly made up amongst the States ships of Ammunition and was not suspected, till in the night of a sudden there was a
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>noyse and a great cracke given which was the blowing up of the said Bush, being amongst the whole Fleet of the States; if the granaded Fireworks and other devises in the Trunkes had dilated its force abroad, as it wrought and flew altogether upward, it had endangered the whole Nauy of the States lying in the River before Huesdon and the towne of Huesdon it selfe, besides the lesse of all the Ammunition and Provision for the Army which lay in these ships. The Marchant fled but the Shipmaster was laid hold on and clapt in prison: there was in the Bush onely one little boy kild.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRVE COPIE OF of a briefe and true Demonstration, why his Majesty of SVVEDEN could in no wise rescue and deliver the Citie <HI>Magdenburgh.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEREIN <HI>The Reader may not onely bee acquainted with those solide Reasons which doe excuse and discharge his Maiesty from all false imputations layd to his Maiesties charge concer∣ning</HI> Magdenburgh. <HI>But also hee shall receive great light of most of his Maiesties proceedings this last yeare past, and the distresse and extremity his Maiesty hath maded thorough and what comfortable successe the Lord hath affoorded him, notwithstanding his manifold obsta∣cles and oppositions.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is an apparent and naked truth. That the Burgamasters, councel, and Citizens of the City <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>burgh</HI> could in no wise be drawn and perswaded to disburse a reaso∣nable summe of money, (upon good assurance) for the ad∣vancement of the levying and raising of forces, for his Maie∣sty of Sweden, tending to the reliefe and deliverance of the said distressed itty in particular, and reducement of the com∣mon Germain Liberties and Priviledges, in generall. Much lesse would they any wise consent and permit, the least quarter or billetting to his Maiesty and his grace the Administrators of Magdenburgh, their conjoyned forces; till at the last, by rea∣son of the enemies blocking of them up, this last siedge, they were compelled thereunto.</P>
<P>Which was the cause, that both the horse and foot-forces
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>neyther might, nor would aggregate, in such a compleat num∣ber, and so opportunely as both they could haue done, and was requisite, insomuch that the enemy gained conueniency and opportunity to blocke up, and besiedge the said Citty, by the meanes wherof his Mai. was of necessity constrained somewhat to desist, and his intention ayming at the generall and publike good, was thereby withdrawne, and exceedingly hindred.</P>
<P>But to the end, that all men may fully be acquainted with the causes which moved his Mai. to this resolution to assemble a convenient and reasonable army in that place afore mentio∣ned. We must know; that even than, where his Princely grace the Administrator of Magdenburgh, in the end of Iuly in the yeare past 1630. came into the Citty, the whole Bishoprick of Magdenburg was very destitute of Imperiall troupes, and fur∣nished with very weake garrison. So that his Princely grace wanted no thing except the aforesaid monies for the raising of souldiers; which if upon earnest request, and soliciting of the said Citty Magdenburgh he could have obtained, in a very short space he might very easily have raised and assembled together certaine thousands of men, and by that meanes haue prevented and put by the siedge, which <HI>Papenheym</HI> hath then begun with very few forces, yea he might than have diverted the whole State of that warre, have withdrawn all warlike provision and necessaries from the enemy, and assembled his forces even with∣in the Citty. He might also have built an inexpugnable fort or Tower, and have constituted <HI>Sedem Belli,</HI> to second, and de∣fend all the adjacent places against the unspeakable Tyranny, and perceiving impositions of his adversary. And here we o∣mit to speake of all other important and many consequences of warre. Especially, this is to be regarded, that this Citty by this meanes might so long have bin preserved vntill his Mai. of Sweden had quite expelled and ruinated all the Emp. forces in Pomerania, and upon the river Oder. Howsoever, the com∣mon people of this Citty are in this matter very excusable, who by reason of the potent favorites and traitors which the enemy had drawn to him in that Citty, were not able to pro∣ceed with a couragious and manly resolution. Which may suf∣ficiently appeare by the woefull and lamentable ruine of the
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>said Citty, which the treacherous Machination of those tray∣tors of their owne Countrey, brought upon the same, and is meerely to be imputed unto them, for in all this they have prevailed.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all this, it may easily appeare, and by those Citties themselves be made manifest, what vigilant care and diligence his Mai. hath taken, and bestirred himselfe for the obtaining of the said monies by exchange from the Citty Hamburgh and Lubeck, and transported the same to Magden∣bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh, because they, by reason of the Scituation of that place had not opportunity and could not furnish such meanes, not∣withstanding it could be proved easily, that it was not so im∣possible for them as their excuse would make it. So that this fault in the very first beginning is not to be ascribed to his Mai. nor his Princely grace the Administrator of Magden∣burgh. But to those traytors and founders of mischiefe on the one, and to their consorts and adherents, who furnished the enemy with munition, provision &amp;c. on the other side.</P>
<P>And although that his Mai. since that time hath made ouer great summes of money for the maintenance of the souldiers, and also hath transported much provision and all warlike ne∣cessaries to Magdenburgh, and promised the said Citty his Kingly ayd and deliverance, at severall times. Neverthelesse those that are acquainted and skilled in Pollitick and warlike affaires, doe know that those kind of promises are regulated according to conveniencie, and according to the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sibility of men, and the state of things. And are not to be taken so ab∣surdly, as if the Kings maiesty of necessity must for satisfaction of his promise made, endanger and hazard the common wel∣fare, the deliverance of so many hundred thousand soules and consequently his whole royall State, his Kingdome and Coun∣trey, or rather ruinate and utterly undoe the whole worke be∣gunne, and leave all in a desperate state and Condition. Where∣as at the first this Citty might easily have bin holpen with the least supply. And yet furthermore we doe shew and declare, that his Mai. notwithstanding them aboue mentioned reasons hath used and reached forth his best and extreame endeavour, to relieue and deliver this Citty, but hath bin hindered and
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>prevented, and kept back by such obstacles and hinderances, as were impossible for him to shun. Which being demonstra∣ted we are fully perswaded that no man being unpartiall, and voyd of passion, and in his right sences and temper, will any longer in this point accuse and impute any cause unto his Ma∣jesty.</P>
<P>It is well knowne, not onely to the whole Empire but throughout the whole Christian world, that an huge Emperi∣all army being enquartered in the two Dukedomes of Pomera∣nia and Mechlenburgh, had than already cut off the passage from the East-sea to Magdenburgh, which great army in Champagne (especially in horse forces) did farre exceed the army of his Maiesty of Sweden, which was the cause that it proved impossible for his Maiesty with his weake Army to strike thorough so puissant an Army, beeing enquartered in so strong a passage, and passe quite thorough his Enemies the length of forty Dutch miles, unlesse first hee had confirmed himselfe in some place, and had some footing in that strange Countrey.</P>
<P>It is also sufficiently knowne, that notwithstanding his Maiesty used all possible meanes, laboured as soone as possible might bee to advance his chiefest Troupes, and induct them into those parts. Neverthelesse, it was in the moneth No∣vember, 1630. before these forces arrived.</P>
<P>Which, when hee had received and reduced into his army under him the whole cold Winter, ayming especially to attaine to the deliverance of the sayd City Magdenburgh. It is to bee doubted, whether or no, any man in so rigid and sharpe a Winter, and in the middest of so many inconveniences, and passing thorough so many obstacles, hath ever effected so much and in so short a space. For by meanes of this his Maiesties incomparable labour in this hard time, it plea∣sed Almighty God, (from whom proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tory) to de∣liver up into the hands of his Maiesty with admirable victo∣ry, those two mighty passages of Gartz and Griffenhagen. Which if his Maiesty had not obtained, it had bin impos∣sible for him, and very unadvisedly done, to have proceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d any farther, unlesse his Maiesty contrary to all rules a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>Instructions of warre, and contrary to reason and poli∣ticke prudencie, would haue hazarded and endangered the common welfare and his owne state, and ruinated them both</P>
<P>Now by reason of this admirable victory which it plea∣sed Almighty God to afford his Maiesty, he obtained so much advantage of his Enemy, that he might easily have fallen uppon the very head of him, and utterly rui∣nated all his forces, and consequently (by Gods assistance,) without great hinderance, or losse have delivered the said Citty Magdenburgh. If his Maiesty, could but have obtained the passage and thoroughfare, through the strong and mighty fortresse Custrin, which he sought and required of the commander <HI>Krachten,</HI> who then commanded there, with earnest intreaty and supplication, upon good assurance.</P>
<P>Hereupon did follow very great inconveniences. His Maiesty through want of victualls and furniture, was con∣strained to let his enemy escape and retire to Lantsbergh.</P>
<P>His Royall Army also by reason hereof happened into se∣verall dangers and extreamities. The Catholick blood-thir∣sty Enemy by this meanes was not ruinated, who otherwise was brought into a remedilesse confusion. Neither could his Maiesty wholly purge the River Elue, and all the Countrey betweene the Elue and the Eest-sea, from these bloody and cruell Enemies. Much lesse could his Maiesty relieue and se∣cond the rest of the Evangelicall Princes with a victorious hand. Who now are extreamely in danger to loose all spi∣rituall and temporall liberties and priviledges.</P>
<P>All these inconveniences did hence proceed, because his Maiesty could not obtain the aforesaid passage of Custrin from the Commander <HI>Krachten.</HI></P>
<P>If any one object heere, that his Majesty ought to have conducted and brought his Army into his Enemies face the Generall <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly,</HI> and rouzed him up with his Army. Wee have already shewed, that his Maiesties army, was exceedingly wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied, and that whole winter grievously weakened. And by reason of the refusall of the passage of Custrin, not onely
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>debilitated but decreased, and therefore not capable and suffici∣ent to oppose so great a power as <HI>Tilly</HI> than had. Neither did his Maj. hold it expedient and commendable, to proceed des∣perately and to hazard the whole matter in a dangerous fight. Which if it had not well succeeded, as apparently it might not, the good City <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> had fared never the better.</P>
<P>When <HI>Tilly</HI> was retired out of Pomerania and Mechlenburgh, than was the City <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> assaulted with the greatest and extreamest power, so that it is in no wise to be imputed to his Maiesty that the sayd City was not delivered. Concerning the time whilest this siedge did continue, it is not unknowne that the Emperors army being strong before both of horse and foot, and having taken those aforesaid passages by the <HI>Oder,</HI> did refortifie themselves and adde unto their forces 12000. and came into a perfit state and posture, in the <HI>Nieumarck, O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ker∣marek,</HI> especially at <HI>Francfort, Lantsb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> and the Countrey of <HI>Steynbergh,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Crosses.</HI> Moreover the Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> with many thousands both foot and horse being enquar∣tered on this side of the Elve and Mockeren, was very vigilant, and did duely attend all occasions. Insomuch that it was not plausible for his Maj. to leave such an Army as was before men∣tioned behind his back, and meeting the Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> by that meanes, to thrust himselfe between the doore and the hindge, <HI>Inter Malleum &amp; incunem.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding all this, his Majest. of Sweden to shew and manifest his Christian resolution, and good intention for the restoring and recovering of the Germaine liberties and privi∣ledges of the Protestant Churches, &amp; for the discharging of his Majesties Conscience, and for his reputation, with a Heroicke courage did assault the very heart of the whole Imperiall Army within the City <HI>Francfort,</HI> than being at least 700<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. strong. Where, with extraordinary victory (which it pleased God in respect of his Christian intention to afford him) hee defeated, overcame, and utterly ruinated them, so that now hee had no such cause more to feare his enemy behind him. Howsoever this is to be considered, that in a very short space 6000. men were againe recollected together, under the Cōmander <HI>Schou∣wenburgh</HI> at great Glogau in Silesia, which 6000. men by all
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>likelihood, by reason of the confluxe of many forces from Sile∣fia, Mehren, Bohemia, and Hungaria, might have beene excee∣dingly augmented.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, but disregarding all this, as also that Ge∣nerall <HI>Tilly</HI> could easily adjoyne his forces to the rest, transpor∣ting them over the Elve by meanes of the Bridge layd neere unto <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> his Maj. did so much respect, and tender the good City <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> that not fearing the great danger after good deliberation, himselfe in person, with his whole Army marched to Berlyn, there to obtaine the strong fort Span∣dau, to the end that his Maj. in time of necessity might have a sure retreat. Which having obtained, his Maj. proceeded for∣ward on the way to Potzdam, hoping that whereas the saving of the City <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> did so deeply concerne the Prince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lector of Saxony, that his Princely Excellence would assist him with some troupes and certaine pieces of Ordnance, mu∣nition, powder, shot &amp;c. for the furthering of this great and heauy enterprize of relieving the City Magdenburgh, or at leastwise, affoording him a free passage and thorough-fare over the Dassaw-bridge, by which meanes his Majesty might have received all manner of necessaries from <HI>Meyssen,</HI> and more con∣veniently have passed along the River neere unto the City in∣tended. Therefore his Maj. did to this end send severall mes∣sengers, with divers moving and extreame patheticall letters. The chiefest whereof were basely kept backe aboue 14. dayes.</P>
<P>Lastly, when now the time of delivery was approaching and necessity required no longer delay; and therefore his Majesty had brought up his Army to undertake the maine businesse, and now or never to effect some notable thing for the common good. The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> frustrated his expectation, and flatly denyed him all his former requests, appealing to his du∣ty and devotion which they vowed, and the obligation where∣with they were obliged to his Imperiall Majesty.</P>
<P>As concerning the Marquis of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> his Excellence (notwithstanding his Maiesty might have depended upon his assistance) did not deliver or at leastwise could not deliver, un∣to his Maiesty, those necessaries of victuals and shipping in such time and measure as was expected and requisite. But ra∣ther
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>had a respect and did appeale to the example and resoluti∣on of the Prince Elector of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xony.</HI></P>
<P>In summe, the Duke of Saxony, and the Marquis of Branden∣burgh, have both of them so managed the businesse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd caried themselves, that his Maiesty could not perceive wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther they were friends or enemies</P>
<P>Wherefore the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emisses being granted, all his Maiesties chiefe Commanders have beene <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to confesse, and all ex∣perienced in matters of Warre cannot deny it. That if his Maiesty had ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched forward without being assured of provi∣sion from Saxony; That such a tyred and unwilling Army, (though <HI>Tilly</HI> had beene alone in his Posture) through want of su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tenance, and heate of weather and faintnesse, of necessity most part of the same had p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved fugitive, part of the same famished, and the Arm, it selfe intirely destroyed.</P>
<P>Hereupon his Maiesty not many da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es after, being informed concerning the Lamentable destrustion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayd City, was constrained to retre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not without great g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iefe and sorrow of heart, and by reason of su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h an important alteration, casu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e his proceeding by other meanes, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enter volen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> of ne∣cessity proceed by such meanes, which would seeme very dif∣ficult unto the ignorant and unskilfull. But the nature of Warre, and the common necessity doth require farre more dif∣ficulty.</P>
<P>All which beeing ballanced, and unpartially perpended, by all those that are skilled in Warlike and Politike affayres, the same will serve for a sufficient discharge of his Maiesty both before God and all the world. Especially, since hee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it doth appeare, that his Maiesty hath used his uttermost power and endeavour.</P>
