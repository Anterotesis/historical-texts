<P>ON Sunday last / the Pope is gone to Vati∣cano in the Chappels / being accompanied with all the Ambassadours / Prelates and other Nobles there present.</P>
<P>It is understood from Naples that there are <HI>3000</HI> men taken on / to be used upon the Catho∣like Army.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<OPENER><DATELINE>From Venize <DATE>the 12. hereof.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>Newes from Thurino mentioneth that in Piemont are put <HI>2000</HI> horsemen and <HI>6000</HI> foote men / whereby it is thought that the Duke of Savoy hath som speciall matters in hand / it is also understood from Schweits / that the Frēch Ambassadour is very ill content concerning the Capitulatie / which the Liga Grisa had made with the Governour of Milan / to the great hin∣drance of his King and the Graubaunderen.</P>
<P>Advise from Constantinopel mentioneth that the setting forwards of the Great Turke was published / and that in the ende of Februarij last past the whole Armey of three hundred thousand men should come together at Adrianopel: And that the Cosackes gathered together with a very greate Power to march against the Turkes.</P>
</DIV2>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From Vienna <DATE>the 17. of Martij.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>The Ambassadour of Polen would leuy <HI>20.</HI> thousand mē in Germanie / whereunto the Em∣perour hath consented / but they will be hardly raysed / never the lesse the Earle of Altheim hath given many Comissions out already. The Co∣sackes last mentioned / which could not get through to goe homewards / because of the Hun∣garians / have lost above <HI>1000.</HI> horses by Scali∣hits and all there bootie is taken from them / so that the rest of them retired this wayes againe.</P>
<P>The handeling of Peace at Haimburg conti∣nueth yet / and there is another Prolongation made until the <HI>25.</HI> of this moneth. The Bu∣diani and other Hungarian Lords do seeke for mercy at the Emperours hands / and weare gladly set free from Betlem Gabor / and they long much to see the Emperours Armey to fall into Hungarie / whereby they might the more conveniently put themselves under the Empe∣rour.</P>
<P>The <HI>12</HI> hereof hath Betlem beset the Cittie of Presburg and the Castle with <HI>6000</HI> Hunga∣rians / likewise planted many Turkes and Tar∣tarians on the other side of the Donaw. The sayd Betlem hath done an attempt upon The∣ben / but to no effect / he hath in like manner gi∣ven order to fortifie the Hungarian Altenburg and Presburg.</P>
<P>Although Bethlem Gabors Chaunsellor is gone to Thyrna with secret resolutions to have them ratifyed / yet it seemes that Bethlem Ga∣bor doth feare that his Chanssellor might goe in any danger to Haimburg / so long as the French Ambassadour doth not assure that he shall com to Presburg againe without danger.</P>
<P>At Haimburg is a Spie from Savoy / and he is taken and imprisoned / who killed himselfe there / the next day a Hungarian was taken / who was determined to doe greate matters against the Emperour the Cittie of Vienna and the Earle of Bucquoy / it seemes the Emperour is minded to goe from hence to Graets / where he meanes to Create / and, make the old Prince Governour there.</P>

<P>On Sonday last arrived heere the Deputies or Lords Commissioners from Vienna / and they first take in hand the cause / concerning the arrested persons / so that it is to be feared that it will cost som there heads heere and at Vienna.</P>
<P>Yesterday is brought hither the Lord of Har∣ranck / the which hath beene the Chamber Pre∣sident of the Bohemians in those rumors / and put in strong imprisonment.</P>

<P>Our Commissioners are arived heere yester∣day from Dresden with good contentment / na∣mely that the Duke Elector of Saxens dealing with the Emper. Maj. and these Lands stoode upon a good peace / and that at this present it stands but upon the ratification of both sides / though Betlem Gabor threatens / that if they doe fall from the Conferation / hee will plague them with fire and sword / never the lesse it is hooped that the Souldiors shall be casseerd of both sides / by reason the Poole is to be feared / who is much threatened of the Turke / like as advise comes / that the Turkes have roved with in <HI>6.</HI> leagues of Cracou / pilladging and burning all away / and taken many thousand people pri∣soners.</P>
<P>It stands also very badly with Moravia / for heere is com certaine newes / that Betlem Ga∣bor hath sent <HI>20</HI> thousand Hungarians / Turks and Tarters over the Wittenberg / and many thousands follow / who spare no man with stea∣ling and burning all away.</P>

<P>The Letters of Dansick mention / that the Turkish Emperour hath sent this fearefull let∣ter heare following:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>A disdaynfull Letter, vvritten by the Tur∣kish Emperour to the King of Polen.</HEAD>
<P>Wee Mahomet Suldan / Illustruous and Vnconquerable Emperour and Angel of God / Turkish Emperour / Macedonian and Babi∣lonian King / in great and small Egipt / Ruler of whole Christendom and Europe / King in Alex∣andrja and Iuda / in like manner of Portugall / and over all the Potentates upon the Earth / al∣so a Lord of Lordes over all Lordes / keeper of the Heathens Parradijs / and the Holy Graves / as well of the great Prophet Mahomet at Me∣cha / as the worthie Prophet at Ierusalem / King of all Kinges / Lord of all Lordes / Prince of all Princes / Lord of all Gods upon the Earth / Lord of the Trce of lyff / of all Townes and Castles / Lord of the great and small Sea / Lord of all Hauens and Ryvers / Lord of all Streames on the whole World / the great Go∣vernour above all Governours of Townes.</P>
<P>Doe send unto thee King of Poland our Em∣perourlike greetinge / for that thou with thy little King in thy secret Councell for thy owne partilar profit dost take in hand / to stryve a∣gainst our Illustrius person / and most powre∣full King / and wee doe wonder that thow dost not feare our great might / and thy owne death with thy little King / considdering that thou in former time didst seeke peace with us / and ther upon sent thy Ambassadors often / whome did assure us thy desire of quyetnes / and that thow wouldst not have any ill thought to doe any thing to the contrarye / and yet thow hast taken upon thee not onely in our Government / but also in Mnscou to fall upon our Vassalls / and determined with thy selfe utterly to spoyle thē: Like as many places are destroyed / taken in / and spoyled. So that thow shalt know / doe what thow canst / wee wilbe revenged one thee and thy little Kings with whome thou hast cō∣quered the same / and meanest to set them in Governement / And not only be revendged / but pursew thee to the uttermost / to blot out the re∣membrance of thy name / and because thou shalt know what more revenge thou hast urged us to / is onely by reason / that thou hast broken the Leagne betwixt us / disdayned and abused the same / and therefore assure thy self with thy litle Kings to be brought before us / and thou shalt see with what power from all the places of the World that shall come to me / how I will over∣run thee / and use thee with thy prysoners so cruelly as may be / therefore henceforwardes thou needest not to hope of any mercy at our hands / and that wee are not a frayd of thy strong places / or for thy strong Walles at Cra∣cou / for wee will not only fall upon that towne and likewise thy court / but also thy Camp and whole Land / and so spoyleand ruinate them / that not one stoue shall remayne upod another / also root out the remembrance of thee and thy Kingdome.</P>
<P>In witnes or taken hereof wee send thee hear with our blodye Sable / for that it shall speedly be followed by as / and then wee will so cover thy Land with horse troopes / foot Companies and Cammels / that like in many yeares hath not been seene. Only that Gods wrach thorow us / may be layd upon thee / for God is an up∣holder of the good / and a punisher of evell and peacebrekers / ād like as wee are unto the a God upon Earth / so wee doe shake out our rod and anger against thee / onely to punish thy false breaking of Truce.</P>
<P>Let now thy Gods come to help thee / if they will / neverthelesse it shall not helpe thee / thy Holyons wee will assuredly put to the Plough / and so make them to plough the voyde Lands of Bulgaria and Iudea / where they shallbe so planted / that none shall returne backe againe / and therefore conteut thy self heare with our meaning as aforesayd.</P>
<P>All this wee have thought good to let thee know our displeasure / from Constantinople / in the yeare of our Rayne / etc.</P>
<P>His Majestie of Denmarke causeth many Souldiors dayly to be raysed. In like manner doth the King of Sweden.</P>
