<HEAD>From <HI>Vienna</HI> the <HI>26.</HI> of Aprill.</HEAD>
<P>Here is great feare conceiued, and men are much perplexed for feare of the King of Sweden, but yet we hope that since the Peace is concluded in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the forces on both sides are withdrawne, that the King of Sweden will meet with more opposition than formerly hee hath done. The Peace at <HI>Sevenbergen</HI> is also contracted. And 1000. Dragonners are al∣ready marched toward Silesia vnder the Commaund of <HI>Den Balthasar.</HI> The Commander <HI>Dona</HI> is also to depart hence with certaine forces to Silesia. Their intent is to prevent the King of Swedens intention, and to stop his proceedings, that he may not make an inroad into Silesia.</P>
<P>Here come messengers daily which are posted from Gene∣rall <HI>Tilly,</HI> to solicite for ayde and more forces against the sub∣tle and powerfull enemy who is now farre fallen into the Em∣pire. His Emperiall Ma: gathers as much money as possibly he can compasse and raises new forces. Here are diuers war∣like Officers with Patents to leavie men.

<P>Whereas the strong City <HI>Lantsbergen</HI> hath long beene be∣seidged by the King of Sweden, and could in no wise bee releeued, nor deliuered (especially since this City <HI>Francfort</HI> was brought vnder the Kings subiection) after they had man∣fully defended themselues, but could no longer subsist they yeelded vpon agreement.

And furthermore declared that they would suffer no more thorough-fares through their Coun∣tries, unlesse all things be payd according to the constitution of the Empire. Which did very much move him, and there∣upon before his departure summoned the chiefe of the Citti∣zens to appeare before the Magistrates, and there caused the a∣greement which was concluded at <HI>Leypsich,</HI> and sent to the Catholike Princes, to be read before them. And afterward questioned of them whether or no they were vnanimously re∣solved to maintaine the same. Whereunto they answered. Yea. And that for the performance and execution of what had beene concluded by that Noble and Princely Assembly, they would wage goods and lives, and spend their very last drop of bloud. The said Commissary <HI>Ossa</HI> presently dispat∣ched a Messenger of purpose to the Emperour: and certifi∣ed him of their strong resolution.

<P>The Emperiall Court-Chaplaine named <HI>Pater Weyngartener,</HI> a Iesuite, hath lately in one of his Sermons exhorted the Supe∣riours to that same (as he termed it) sweet and wished peace. Which he very highly commended unto them, admonishing them to turne their swords into Mattocks, and their Speares and Pikes into Plow-sheares, &amp;c. To the end they might en∣joy land and liberty, and every man walke quietly in his owne Feild, and sit peaceably under his owne Vineyard.</P>
<P>All this weeke they have continued mustering in this City, and the drum beates throughout this whole Realme.

<HEAD>From <HI>Francford</HI> at <HI>Mayn,</HI> the <HI>7.</HI> of May.</HEAD>
<P>There passed lately many ships with <HI>Neapolitan</HI> souldiers to the Low Countries, and 6000. men more will shortly follow them. The Bishop of <HI>Mentz</HI> doth also begin to raise forces, and hath sent the Archdeacon of the Cathedrall, to <HI>Dunkel-Spiell</HI> at the Assembly of the Catholike Prices, to consult with them of the meanes for raising of an Army against the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI> Forces also are leuyed for the Lords of the <HI>Dutch-Or∣der.</HI> Whereof 150. men passed by here yesterday, they have their Rendevous at <HI>Mergendael.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Extract of a certaine letter written from <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> the 23. of Aprill. Wherein may appeare how farre <HI>Tilly</HI> had then proceeded against that City.</HEAD>
<P>THe 12. of this Moneth, the Generall <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Tilly</HI> pre∣sented himselfe in full Battaile a Mile from this Cittie, and seemed as if he would have assaulted this Cittie with his whole Army with maine violence. But he effected nothing, onely he chased some of our souldiers out of their Radoubts which they guarded, but never medled with the great Starre∣sconce, which is built by the <HI>Old Elve.</HI></P>
<P>The 13. the Generall planted 12. Ordnance vpon the banke of the River <HI>Elve,</HI> and with the same made 568, shot upon the
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>bridge of this Citie, intending to ruine the same, and separate it from the Citie▪ To the end he might thereby prevent us from seconding the Toll-house, and the Sconce, but with his vehement shooting he prevailed not much. The Marshall <HI>Diderick Valckenburgh,</HI> gave order that certaine peeces of Ordnance should be planted upon the Toll-house, wherewith we so played upon the enemies Ordnance, that they were constrained to remove them from the Battery.</P>
<P>In the meane while, the Generall with a great fury and a crying noyse, brought his Army dejectedly upon the Toll-Sconce, and all the day, as also most part of the night follow∣ing assaulted the same with 8. severall assaults. Intending al∣so to presse through the out-workes, to which end the foote souldiers were prickt on by the horse with rigour and vio∣lence, but were faine to retyre. For the Marshall <HI>Valker∣burgh</HI> had charged the 4. Ordnance double, with stones, lead, and iron, and set the Souldiers and Cittizens in good order, and brought them against the enemie: insomuch that the E∣nemies that night about twelve of the clocke retyred. Many of them being slaine. Next morning, our souldiers horse and soote fell out of the Citie, and brought in many of them Pri∣soners and many maimed, who declare that in this encounter 2000. men were slaine.</P>
<P>By reason of this successe and deliverance which it hath pleased God to affoord, we have some time of breathing. The Generall seemes as if he tended another way, but God knowes his enterprize: We know not what will become of us, onely we pray God (if it be his will) to deliver us, as hi∣therto, out of the hands of our bloudy enemies.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Leipsich,</HI> the first of May.</HEAD>
<P>Three dayes since our Prince Elector caused the Drumme to beat, and the Trumpets to sound, for the leuying of 12000. foote, and 3000. horse. There come to him a great confluxe of people, and many of the Emperours souldiers. The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> as we are credibly enformed, hath taken <HI>Lantz∣bergen.</HI></P>

<P N="5">5. Lastly, that in the meane while none of the Protestant Princes shall in any wise alter his opinion, or breake his pro∣mise, or exempt himselfe from this defensive worke begun, and undertaken by them.

<P>We are informed here, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> is come be∣fore <HI>Old-Brandenburgh</HI> with his Army, and demanded of the Garrison by a Trumpetter, whether they would surrender the City and depart willingly, or whether they would stand to the rigour and extremity? Whereupon they desired three dayes respite for consultation, but his Majesty of <HI>Sweden</HI> would not permit them so long time, but wished them to resolve speedi∣ly.

<P>Those of <HI>Breda</HI> doe much feare lest they should be besie∣ged, and therefore have well provided that Citie. Many wo∣men for feare are departed thence into <HI>Antwerpe.</HI></P>
<P>The States of <HI>Holland</HI> have made proclamation at <HI>Bergen vp zome,</HI> wherein they prohibit all their subiects thereabouts, as also <HI>Steenbergen</HI> &amp; other places to pay any contribution to the Archdutchesse, vpon penaltie of paying of foure times as much to the States.</P>

<P>The Prinnace called the <HI>Moor,</HI> departed from <HI>Fernambuco</HI> the last of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> and arrived in <HI>Zealand,</HI> lately laden with 75. Chests of Sugar, Comfites, and other good Commodi∣ties. These that came thence report, that all was well and safe with the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> That the <HI>Portugals</HI> do oftentimes come and shew themselues before the Citie, and slay all those they can get within their reach. The Colonell <HI>Waerdenbergh</HI> and the Counsell of Warre, they have caused a Sconce to be built on the otherside of the Land called <HI>Ʋerge,</HI> by which meanes they can the better keepe the Inhabitants in awe, and visit them. They certifie also that divers ships of the Generall <HI>Pa∣ter</HI> were arriued there, and hee himselfe with the rest of his fleet is daily expected, and then they intend to enterprize some notable exploite.</P>
<P>By this time the Armie of his Excellence is readie, being a huge and great Army. The guard of his Excellence on Sun∣day departed from the <HI>Hage,</HI> three other Companies pre∣sently followed them, to wit <HI>Lokerem, Witsen,</HI> and <HI>Graue Lodewicke.</HI> All other Companies and Troupes are marched each to their designed places. His Excellence departs himselse this day being the 17. of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>It is admirable as also delightfull to see the multitude of ships, barkes and boats which daily passe by <HI>Dort</HI> toward the Leager, and downe againe waiting his Excellences leisure where their Rendevous shall be.</P>
<P>This weeke happened a great mischance at <HI>Dort,</HI> through Gunpowder which blew vp a whole house, and did endam∣mage two other houses very much, foure people were killed through this mishap, and many more bruised and burnt, and sorely hurt.</P>
<P>It is confirmed for a certaine from <HI>Spaine,</HI> that the Admi∣rall of the late silver fleete of <HI>Hauana,</HI> (which was taken for the authorized West <HI>India</HI> Company, by the Captaine <HI>Oret: Heyn</HI>) was beheaded for his good service in <HI>Spaine.</HI> The fourth day of the moneth of <HI>March</HI> last past.</P>

<HEAD>A true Information in what manner the Citie of <HI>Mag∣denburgh</HI> was ouercome by the Lord <HI>Iohn Tilly,</HI> Ge∣nerall of the forces of the Emperour, vpon Tuesday the <HI>10.</HI> of <HI>May, 1631.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Together with the wofull and lamentable present estate and condition thereof.</HEAD>
<P>AFter that the said Generall had, as is reported, ma∣ny times offered the City conditions of peace, yea, and vpon the Munday the ninth of <HI>May,</HI> being the day before hee tooke it. But the Citizens would not harken thereunto, no nor in the least manner would so much as take it into their consideration or vnderstandings, though he threatned them, it would otherwise fall very heavy vpon them, and being fur∣ther admonished by the Burgomaster, even upon the Tuesday morning before it was taken. A writing was read vpon the wall of the Citie, expressing a peace then offered to have beene ratified, with the said Ci∣tie, the Arch-dukes of <HI>Saxon, Brandenburgh,</HI> and the house of <HI>Stattene,</HI> conditionally that they would bee subiect to the Popish siege, the which they in no wise would consent vnto, but willingly they would much rather lose their lives and goods.</P>
<P>The Citizens waited and attended with certaine hope, not daily but hourely to bee succoured by the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and in the meane time the Citizens saw that <HI>Tilly</HI> raised his forces, and removed his Lei∣ger, and carried away bag and baggage, and so mar∣ched for halfe a league from them, in which time the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> for want of horses at hand could not come forward with his Artillery, whereupon the Em∣perours
<PB REF="8"/>forces on the Tuesday morning early, turned their forces, and after it was too manifest the Empe∣reours forces had so filled a Ditch neere a gate of the City, called the <HI>Heyecker.</HI> Then with greene grasse or weedes that the Souldiers could wade thorow, though it was deepe to their middles, and so carried scaling ladders on their backes, and so entred the Towne whilest the Burgers were in their Churches at prayer and thankesgiving to God for the departure of their enemies, which so seemed to doe the day be∣fore, in which time the watch on the wals were 2000. Souldiers, 18. companies of Burgers being in all neere 4000. fighting men, the enemy assaulted and entred, the Citizens places together, and at an instant two Cornets of horsemen in blue harnesse, with the rest of the enemies which plundred ouer them, out to pie∣ces and murdered all there, and this continued three houres, in which time the Citie was set on fire in foure or fiue places, and it is yet vnknowne whether it was done by Treason, or by the immediate hand of God, but the sodaine increase and fiercenesse thereof was such by reason of a wonderfull winde, that in a short time all the fires met, and the spoylets that plundred were forced to leaue the most part of the women, maides, and children were smothered and stifled in Vaults and Sellers, where they had hid themselves. Some part of them driven into the fire by violence, many others throwne into the fire, and part of the beautifullest yong women and maids carried into the Campe, there forced, spoiled and carried away in the mean-while, yea, even on that very day was the whole City, with all the in habitants so wasted by the fire and sword, that on the wednesday morning their re∣mayned
<PB REF="8"/>no more standing but the Cathedrall Church and a very few houses standing about it. All the rest both men and beasts consumed to ashes, that the sword left. And none escaped except some very small number that were here &amp; there, which with very great peril ran away, &amp; it is manifest that aboue 20. thousand were murthered and consumed by fire, of men, wo∣men and children. And also above 1500. husbandmen of the Country dwellers thereby, with their wiues &amp; children, with many others Gentlemen of great sort suffered with the Citizens which were gotten into the Citie for their defence.</P>
<P>Also divers Inhabitants of severall Villages within the Bishopricke and parts adioyning: brought in their ancient Deeds and Records of the Lands and Estates which suffered as the Citizens, and none had quar∣ter or deliverance, except one company of Souldiers which desired and had quarter promised them.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Feeld Martiall Falkenburge</HI> a most valiant Souldier sent by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> for the defence of the Citie: was offered pardon and quarter by his e∣nemies, but he and his valiantly despised it, and rather chose to fight and die manfully, and pressing into the market place, fought vntill hee and his had slaine 400. but being ouer-matched by the whole multitude of his enemies that seconded each other against him, was shot to death, and so left by a house wholy set on fire, and so left.</P>
<P>The Lord Administrator or Bishop of the Citie and Confines, having in the flight received a wound on his head, was amongst other prime men taken, carried a∣way prisoner to <HI>Wulfonbuttell</HI> a fort of the Enemies:
<PB REF="9"/>having before he was taken desired his owne Servant to have killed him, but he would not.</P>
<P>In this manner as is set downe that brave Citie of <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> by fire and sword, was in one day consumed with many thousands of Christian poore soules therein as is mentioned. Besides an infinite of riches utterly brought to nothing, that doubtlesse since the destruction of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> scarce any the like wofull spectacle of the great and sodaine devastation of so famous a Citie, and the losse of so much Chri∣stian bloud hath beene heard of. God of his mercie save and deliuer all Christian people their Countries, Lands, and Cities from any the like wofull mishap, and that for Iesus Christ his sake. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
