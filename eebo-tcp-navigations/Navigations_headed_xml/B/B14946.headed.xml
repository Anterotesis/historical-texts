<HEAD>From the Berghestrate 4. dito.</HEAD>
<P>Two daies agone the Pals-Graves souldiors are retired back from steine / they coulde not plant any ordenaunce before the same / the Spaniards have the passe over the Rine / and there comes daily more folk over / they growe very strong and they have taken in Northeina and Wettenheym and taxed them to pay <HI>1000.</HI> Fl. but because the women and Children are fled out of the same the Spaniards have sert fire thereon / in the Bergh∣strate lies greate store of souldiers in all the vil∣ladges round abouts and there resorts dayly more unto them.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>From Amsterdam 18. September.</HEAD>
<P>The letters from Lubec mention that the King of Suethland / doth hold the Sittie Riga in Inf∣land yet strongly desidged both by water and by Land / and his souldiors doth labour hard about the same intending to sett upon them with all his might / because it is understand that the King of Poland is with all expedition seekinge to relieve and defend those of Riga.</P>
<P>We understand that the Sittie of Montaubon in Fraunce is yett besieged of the french King / and that he had taken the subberbs in / and was com under Sittie cannot stand our long / the King hath sent som part of folk to Rochell to burne downe al the milles there abouts and so in time besiedge them for to take a way al there defences and pri∣villedges and so make them a pren for there eni∣mies / who sought to bringe the Spanish help in to the land but those of Rochell are yet in good cou∣rage / they gad on greate Gallion ready and they prepare more.</P>
<P>We understand that som sertayne Merchants ships of Holland coming from Ittalie and think∣ing to passe thest ait of Gybralter and with the most part to goe to the Margaret in West-Inges to fetch sallt there came <HI>9.</HI> great Ships and say led Amongst them / first shooting with powder alone as if they did in tend no hurt / but beeing Amongst them they presently shot as Enimies att them the Hollanders sayled most of them present∣ly / out of the fleet / and the remainders defended themselves valiantly / because the Spaniards had very greate ordinaunce and beeing to strong for the other / so that we here they have taken and sonck <HI>3</HI> Hollanders: now whether this shal be suffered / that the King of Spaine shall acknow∣ledge us for free Lands and yett attempt as Eni∣mies against our Merchants Ships with deceit / time will reveale.</P>
<P>The passages and waies which are serviceable to the Prince of Orenge are made ready through the Berger-dyke to Doesburghe / and we shall see now what the Enimie will take in hand / whose enterprise for this yeare is thought to be disa∣poynted. The Prince of Orenge / with his expe∣rienced Generalls / and Ingeniors / have beene above and about Rees / to view and espie all things / and given order to make those things / which are most needfull for them. Our Shipps of Warre are most sayled to the Sconse's Graven∣weart / where there is made a faire Bridge over both streames. The Prince lies above Embrick by the old Rijne / betwixt Embrick and Rees over against Griet / where he hath first caused his Tent to be pitcht this weeke. The Soul diors lie ronnd aboute in the Dilladges in the Hetter / as at Dor∣nick / Wellingen / Haften and Meeren.</P>
<P>At Rees are divers more new Comp a nies in quartered with in the Cittie and with out in the sconses. The Marcquis Spinola lies with his forces at Wesell / Burck / Santen / and Berck etc. and staieth for Grave Henderick vanden Berghe who is thought to be <HI>7000.</HI> strong and he hath over com the house at Raid aboute Gulick / there Captaine Dietvort lay with his companie so that it is Admired at that they gave it so soone over. His Maj. of Bohemie lies yett in Embrick / he doeth rides somtimes to the Prince but common∣ly comes in to the Cittie agaiue the same night.</P>
