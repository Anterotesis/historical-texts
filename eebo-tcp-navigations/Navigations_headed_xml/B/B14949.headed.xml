<HEAD>From <HI>Venice</HI> the <HI>24</HI> of <HI>May, 1630.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Warre in <HI>Italy</HI> encreaseth daily, and waxeth hotter, the <HI>French</HI> doe strong∣ly fortifie the Incorporated Cities in <HI>Sauoy,</HI> and haue taken another towne of great importance, and now are mar∣ching toward <HI>Cassall,</HI> to relieue that. The <HI>Spanish</HI> on the other side, doe fortifie themselues by the <HI>Piedmont</HI> Sea; with Sconces, retrenchments and men, &amp; lye round about <HI>Cassall,</HI> with aboue 20000 men, with Shot, Canons, and Amunition, vnder the Com∣mand of Colonell <HI>Pianso,</HI> they haue assaulted the little Sconce before <HI>Cassall,</HI> with 6000 men but were beaten backe twice manfully and couragiously by the <HI>French.</HI> Insomuch that they were compelled to retyre, with the losse of the said Colonell <HI>Piause</HI> and 800 more.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> and the Imperialists lye ouer∣thwart against each other in battell, and they doe daily skirmish with each other. His Maiestie of <HI>France</HI> will by no meanes yeeld to any agreement, but striues to ac∣complish his designe and purpose. The Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> demaunds great summes of moneys from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> pretending that he means to performe some nota∣ble exploit. In <HI>Millan</HI> dy daily about 80 or 100 persons, &amp; in diuers other Cities. All fruits and lands are quite
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>ruinated, insomuch that a great dearth may be expe∣cted.</P>
<P>In shutting vp of this Letter, commeth tydings that the <HI>French</HI> haue brought great supply and reliefe into <HI>Cassall.</HI> The P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rats of <HI>Thunis</HI> and <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>giers,</HI> haue done exceeding great harme vpon the Coast of <HI>Sicile,</HI> and haue taken diuers ships, and haue strain'd a very great and richly laden ship.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Rome</HI> the <HI>25</HI> of <HI>May. 1630.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We vnderstand from <HI>Spaine,</HI> that there was great ioy lately at Court, concerning the birth of some young Prince. And that Letters ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come from <HI>Don Frederico,</HI> which mention, that the Fleet is happily come into the <HI>Hauana.</HI> And they did hope that the same Fleet would safely arriue in <HI>Spaine</HI> about the end of this same moneth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Venice</HI> the <HI>24</HI> of <HI>May.</HI></HEAD>
<P>From <HI>Millan,</HI> we learne that the <HI>Dutch</HI> are arriued in the same Command of the which already, 7000 foote, and 800 horse are vnder the Commaund of those of <HI>Mantua,</HI> being marched thither. The rest are laid in <HI>Montserat.</HI> The Generall <HI>Piccolomeni</HI> is to conduct them thither 12000 foot more, and 3000 horse.</P>
<P>Now newly commeth tydings that the <HI>French</HI> haue taken the head towne <HI>Chambery,</HI> with agreement. And that Mounsieur <HI>Bassampier</HI> hath also besieged some place of importance. It is coniectured, and is also very proba∣ble that all <HI>Sauoy</HI> will fall vnder the obedience of the <HI>French</HI> King.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Venice</HI> the <HI>31</HI> of <HI>May.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We heare from <HI>Piedmont,</HI> that being his Maiestie of <HI>France</HI> had well beset the City of <HI>Chambery,</HI> he himselfe with all his forces is proceeded farther into <HI>Sauoy,</HI> so to approach with maine force into <HI>Italy.</HI> The <HI>Spanish</HI> doe begin to breake vp apace, and to forsake <HI>Cassall,</HI> some going towards <HI>Millan,</HI> others towards <HI>Sauoy,</HI> to hinder the passage with greater force. The forces of the Duke
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>of <HI>Mantua</HI> and his <HI>Seignorie,</HI> happened into a hot skir∣mish with the Imperialists, who with some 20000 strong, did striue to lodge in the Dukedome of <HI>Mantua.</HI> In this skirmish, many were slaine on both sides. How∣soeuer, they hindered the Imperialists in their intention, who were constrained to seeke other Quarters, where they begin to entrench themselues, by reason the Cardi∣nall comes downe with such a strong Army. The plague encreaseth exceedingly among the souldiers, as well in field as in the towne. The Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> is about to furnish another Army, which vnder the protection of the Emperour, he intends to bring against this <HI>Seigniory.</HI> To this end are come diuers summes of ready money from the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> into <HI>Genua,</HI> with promise of fiue millions more, as soone as the siluer or Plate-Fleete shall be arriued.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Verona</HI> the <HI>3</HI> of <HI>Iune.</HI></HEAD>
<P>From <HI>Millan</HI> is written that the Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> is departed toward <HI>Frasineto,</HI> to vndertake the siege of <HI>Cassall</HI> on the <HI>Netherland</HI> manner. He hath already brought thither 40 pieces of Ordnance, amongst them 24 Culuerins, with many Granadoes and Fireworkes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> haue made a strong assault on the out∣ward Works of the same City, and driuen the <HI>French</HI> vn∣to the very gates of the City. In which bickering, many <HI>Spaniards</HI> were slaine, especially those of the Regiment of <HI>Schauwenborgh.</HI> At this present, they haue made a Battery before the Citie, and doe begin to shoot. The Commander <HI>Gallas</HI> hath placed himselfe, with 6000 Musketiers, and 1500 horsemen, betweene this City and <HI>Mantua,</HI> to depriue those of <HI>Mantua</HI> of their Prouiand and Amunition which they conuey, which the <HI>Seignorie</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> will striue to hinder.</P>
<P>The Imperialists haue taken <HI>Ʋalesio, Villa Franca,</HI> and all the townes <HI>Cauttatto,</HI> in the which the <HI>Venetians</HI> haue lost at least 2000 men Their Generall <HI>Sagreto</HI> was com∣pelled with his Artillerie and men to retyre. All this
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>while the Imperialists doe much wrong, and waste the Countrey with burning, for you may see one fire conti∣nually kindled after another.</P>
<P>In the last encounter before <HI>Goyto,</HI> the Imperialists tooke from the <HI>Ʋenetians,</HI> 25 Ancients, and 4 Cornets which shall be presented to the Duke of <HI>Friedland,</HI> by the Commander <HI>Picolomeni.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Italy</HI> the <HI>8</HI> of <HI>Iune.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The reason why the Duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> sent the <HI>Abbot de la Scaglia</HI> into <HI>Spaine,</HI> was to assure the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> concerning his constancy and fidelity as also to giue him thankes for the great assistance and succour which hee had afforded him in these late occurrences.</P>
<P>From <HI>Geneua</HI> it is reported that the Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> hath retyred himselfe out of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> from <HI>Chambergh</HI> to <HI>Montmelian.</HI> Yeelding vnto those of <HI>Chambergh,</HI> and o∣ther Cities which are not tenable, free consent to ac∣commodate themselues with <HI>France,</HI> as they shall see fit∣ting But not to change their affections and loue against the house of <HI>Sauoy.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Vienna</HI> the <HI>5</HI> of Iune.</HEAD>
<P>Since his Emperiall Maiesty departed hence, there is but little happened, onely we vnderstand from <HI>Hungary</HI> that the <HI>Turks</HI> doe assemble very strong; it is feared that the <HI>Turke</HI> will attempt something against <HI>Hungary.</HI> Whereupon the Citie Magistrates here haue caused the Bridge with all necessaries to be repaired. Also in <HI>Hun∣garie</HI> is command giuen for the amending of the Fron∣tiers, and fortification of the same.</P>
<P>By reason that about <HI>Lowen,</HI> some 20 <HI>Turkes</HI> which went out a breebooting, and robbing, were slaine and found dead; The <HI>Turkes</HI> haue againe in great Compa∣ny assembled together and fallen vpon the Merchants of <HI>Lowen</HI> returning homeward, and kill'd three hundred of them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Prague</HI> the <HI>18</HI> of June.</HEAD>
<P>All is at peace and quiet here. Onely here are cer∣taine
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>Companies of <HI>Crabates</HI> expected here, who shall by the Deputies Commissarie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be inducted here.</P>
<P>In <HI>Hungary</HI> also are leuyed certaine hundred horse, to what end is not yet knowne.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Silecia</HI> the <HI>10</HI> of June.</HEAD>
<P>We doe vnderstand that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> will fall into these parts with 8000 horse, and fiue Regiments of foot. The <HI>Oderstream</HI> wheresoeuer Bridges are, is to that end fortified with Sconces, and from <HI>Breslau</HI> thither is euery day sent great store of Prouiand. The dearth continues still, insomuch that many dye of hunger.</P>

<P>The Emperialists which haue hitherto layn in <HI>Older∣burland, Coburgh Wymeren, Swatzenburg</HI> and other quar∣ters, are now broken vp, they bend their course &amp; march towards the Bridge of <HI>Dassow,</HI> there to hinder the com∣ming of the <HI>Swedish.</HI></P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Lowen Saxonis 6</HI> Iune.</HEAD>
<P>Diuers of the Emperors forces are expected into <HI>Po∣meren,</HI> which should descend from <HI>Maeghdenberg,</HI> the Bishopricke of <HI>Halberstadt.</HI> They are already vpon the march, and ready to beset the places, neare and about the Sea. The Duke of <HI>Friedland</HI> is passed through <HI>Neu∣renborch</HI> to <HI>Meningen,</HI> and through <HI>Elue</HI> to the Army, to affront the <HI>French</HI> Army.</P>
<P>The Prince Elector <HI>Saxon,</HI> is as yet at rest, and keepes himselfe still, causeth no forces to be raised. He will try whether he can preuaile by Messengers with the Empe∣rour, concerning the monies which are disbursed.</P>
<P>Now we here from all parts, of the comming of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and that the same King is present in <HI>Pru∣ysen</HI> in his owne person, and conueyes his men through <HI>Breslau</HI> into <HI>Pomeren.</HI> The troopes of foot daily imbar∣ked, and to this end many ships are stayed in diuers Ha∣uens of <HI>Pruysen,</HI> which land the souldiers in <HI>Pomeren.</HI> His Maiesty is dayly expected in <HI>Straelsondt;</HI> and he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th well prouided all his Townes and Cities.

The same <HI>Torquato</HI> keepes his Rendenouz about <HI>Stargart.</HI> Within few dayes there marched certaine of his Com∣panies with 4 peeces of Ordnance toward <HI>Grissenhagen.</HI></P>
<P>They now write from <HI>Statin,</HI> that the Commander <HI>Torquato</HI> is there. And the Councell hath at his request for certaine houres beene together.</P>
<P>From <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> The King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> hath giuen charge, for all ships and goods, in that Citie in <HI>Norway,</HI> and in his whole Kingdome to be slayed and arrested.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Hamburgh.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The whole Company here is enioyned by the Magi∣strates, by all meanes to deny the King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> the Toll which at <HI>Gheluckstadt</HI> he requires of the sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps. To this end they haue prepared 30 warlike ships, well mounted with Ordnance, and all kind of prouision, in∣tending to encounter with the Kings ships, which are now in the Riuer <HI>Elue.</HI> It is likely that here will grow hot warres. This City causeth daily men to be leuyed. And the King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> makes no lesse preparations.</P>
<P>Now commeth tydings that the King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> is departed from <HI>Gheluckstadt</HI> to <HI>Coppenhagen,</HI> because the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had enquartered certaine thousands of his men in <HI>Schoonen.</HI> Which is a great easement to
