<HEAD>From Vienna the 2. of September. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>FRrom Vienna is written the <HI>2.</HI> hereof, that <HI>1000</HI> of the Emperors souldiers horse and loote, were sent out of his army with <HI>500.</HI> waggons to the Hoye to fetch in forrage, and hauing laden their wagons with hay, corne, and oates, were set vpon by the Hungers: who though they ensconced themselues within their wagons, and stoutly defende them, yet in the end, the Hungars ouercame and fiue them, set fire on the wagons, tooke many prisoners and few escaped.</P>
<P>The garrison in Presburge are <HI>5000.</HI> strong who defend the towne valiantly hauing sallied out vp∣on <HI>Bethlems</HI> army, and set vpon those that lay en∣sconced in the suburbs, beat and slue <HI>200.</HI> of them &amp; nayled vp foure peeces of artillery being not able to carry them away, yet finding themselues too weake to stay, hauing lost many of their company were glad to retire. The like attempt they made yesterday vpon the sconce of <HI>Bethlems</HI> at my, but with the losse of ma∣ny of the Neapolitans were forced to retire. In the meane time the Budian Hungers rob and ransack the countrey euen within two miles of this citty Vienna, all ouer betweene that and Newstad, where they haue burnt downe to the ground <HI>20.</HI> of the Em∣perors speciall villages and dorpes, killed many of the people, driuing away the cattle with them, very pittifull to behold. So as in these quarters no body tarryeth in any parishes or hamlets, and there is no safe passing to Newstad and Stermarke: vnto these proceedings there is none to oppose, which maketh this city to be pestered with beggars and poore people where many starue with hunger, whereby appeareth the wrath of God to be ouer these countries.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Vienna the 4. of September.</HEAD>
<P>FRom Vienna is also written, that many people going to S. <HI>Mary</HI> cloyster to be shriuen, the Hun∣gars fell vpon and slue them. And present newes is come, that <HI>Bethlem</HI> hauing formerly left Iagerens-dorfein his stead in the army, was risen and marched to meete with the Spaniards, appointed out of <HI>Mo∣rauia</HI> to march to the Schat, and meeting them set vpon them all. The Emperour hath also sent <HI>10.</HI> en∣signes of countrey people to the towne of Lintz to guard the countrey about Ense (formarly mor∣gaged to Bauaria by the Emperour) from the inua∣sion of the Hungers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Prague the 2. of September.</HEAD>
<P>FRom Prague is written of the second hereof that the Burgers in al the three townes of Prague are warned to appeare at the towne hall, where euery one (especially the companies) that they out of the stockes, and euery Burger to his vttermost power and ability to take care to be well prouided of store of victuals, to the end least by this sorrowfull warre we fall into great necessity, the rather by reason of the continuance of the robberies and ransackings vp∣on the passages. As also but the other day certaine waggons with merchanoise within a mile of this cit∣ty were taken and spoyled. Wherefore it is thought meet to haue <HI>1000.</HI> horsemen leuyed to serue there at the charge of Burgers. It is also written frō Prague the towne of Tabor in Bohemia (so long besiegd by <HI>Baltazar</HI>) hauing preuailed nothing, will leaue it, the most of the countrey people being run away, hauing lost many of his small army in the last assault.</P>

There is some at∣tēpt to bedon ere long, for there are seueral Ambas∣sadors come fyom <HI>Blethlem Gabor,</HI> Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> and other Potentates to <HI>Mansfield.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperor hath written to the city of Nurem∣burge commanding them vpon a great penalty to suffer no victuals to passe to <HI>Mansfields</HI> army, wher∣upon <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath taken order to make price of all Nuremburgers, so as no man dares looke out of the gates, as also they can send no goods to Frankford-being already diuers wagons taken with goods com¦ming to Nuremburge.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Wesell the 8. of September,</HEAD>
<P>THe Marquesse <HI>Spinola</HI> at his comming to We∣sell, thought here and there to worke wonders, but the coming of the illustrious Prince of Orange, whose eye pries so narrowly into his prodeedings, as he knowes not where to begin, and therefore hath sent most of his army to Guylicke, where he will bée as well looked vnto as he was at Wesell, and will find Gulicke furnished with famous experienced souldiers; and so farre as we it perceiue, the army he hath there is not sufficient wholy to besiege it, but if he can get it with threatnings to hang them if he get it, as he got the castle of Reede by Gulicke by like threateinge: but captaine <HI>Ditford</HI> the commaun∣der thereof is taken and brought to the Princes ar∣my, and there lost his head by sentence of the Court of warre, his Lieftenant and Ancient are in prison.</P>
<P>The towne of Gulick is besieged vpon on side by the graue Vandenbergh, but <HI>2.</HI> gates of the town ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> free to go in and out without let.

<P>And touching the enemies attempt vpon Isendick and those quarters neere sluce, and repulsed by Gods hand, it is hoped it will proceed no further, the rather for that they fayled in their first purpose, and all pla∣ces with souldiers are better prouided, whereunto the States of Holand haue indeuoured to pruent the enemy by sending certaine companies of Burgers to Sluce to strengthen that and the rest, that where <HI>200</HI> were before, is now added <HI>300.</HI> more together with many lusty martiners. who labour in cutting of wals to let in water to ouerflow the low grounds. The e∣enemy is sayd to be at present betweene Haste gras skonce and Sluce, where he would attempt to get in∣to the Ile of Cadlant if he could to straiten Sluce, but by the comming of the aforesayd supplyes, and the care of the Prince of Orange in granting out of euery company in the army a certain number which he hath sent, is hoped will suffice to frustrate the e∣nemies purpose.</P>
