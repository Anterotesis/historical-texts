<HEAD>The CASE of the French Prote∣stants Refugees, settled in and about London, and in the English Plantations in America.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas there is a Clause in a Bill brought into the Honorable House of Com∣mons, Entituled, <HI>An Act for preventing Frauds, and Regulating Abuses in the Plan∣tation-Trade;</HI> in these Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And be it further Enacted, by the Authority aforesaid, That no Alien or Foreigner, or any Person or Persons, other than such as are Natives of</HI> England <HI>or</HI> Ireland, <HI>or such Persons as are born in His Majesty's Plantations in</HI> Asia, Africa, <HI>or</HI> America, <HI>shall, after the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈1 span left blank〉"/> Day of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Exercise the Trade or Occupation of a Merchant or Factor, in any of the said Plan∣tations, upon pain of the Forfeiture of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈1 span left blank〉"/> one <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈1 span left blank〉"/> to His Majesty, one to the Governor of the Plantation, where such Persons shall so offend, and the other <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈1 span left blank〉"/> to the Person suing for the same in any of His Majesty's Courts in the Plantation where such Offence shall be committed,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The French Protestants Refugees in this Kingdom, in behalf of themselves, and of the French Protestant Refugees settled in the English Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> do humbly Represent, That having been cruelly prosecuted in their Native Countrey, for the sake of their Religion, they came and sheltered themselves in this Kingdom, being invited there-to by the late King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's <HI>Declaration</HI> of the 28th of <HI>July</HI> 1681: And since, by another of his present Majesty, made the 25th of <HI>April</HI> 1689, inviting all French Protestants hither, and promising them their Protection <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>That upon this Encouragement they came over in great Numbers, bringing all they could convey away with them, with their Trades, Arts, and Manufactures, and were very kindly received by this Nation, and had that Favour shewn to them, that a great many of them were made Free Denisons.</P>
<P>That they also being invited by several of the Lords Proprietors of the English Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> to go thither and inhabit those Countries, many of them transported themselves and Families there, with great Hazards, Troubles and Charges.</P>
<P>That some Hundred Families of them are now settled there, and have improved in a man∣ner those Colonies, by making the Ground Arable, and by their Trades, Labours and Indu∣stry; insomuch, that particularly <HI>Carolina</HI> and <HI>New York</HI> are, for the most, inhabited by them.</P>
<P>That the said French Protestants Refugees, settled here and in those Countries, have, on all Occasions, shewed their Loyalty, Zeal and Affection, to the present Government, by suppor∣ting very chearfully the Charges and Taxes of the Land, and wearing Arms for the Defence of it, especially in the Attacks of <HI>Quebek, Martinico, Guadalupa, Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>St. Domingo,</HI> se∣veral having lost their Lives, and others being wounded, in those Occasions: And many there and here being come to great Losses, both by the Earthquake at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and by the Enemies Privatiers at Sea.</P>
<P>That if such a Clause should be inserted, all those poor People there would be reduced to the greatest Extremities, or forced to return back to <HI>England,</HI> where they must starve, or be maintained by the Publick Charity. Besides the great Prejudice those who are settled in this Kingdom will unavoidably receive by it, having the most part of their small Stocks imployed in the Plantation Trade, to support their Brethren there, and procure a small Livelihood to their Families here.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore they humbly pray this Honorable House to commiserate their Condition, and use such Methods for their Relief, as this Honorable House in their Wisdom and Charity shall think fit.</HI></P>
