<OPENER>To the Tune of King and poor northern Man.</OPENER>
<LG>
<L>IT was my chance as I did walk</L>
<L>a history for to read,</L>
<L><HI>Solomon</HI> wise, when he reign'd King,</L>
<L>did many a worthy deed</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Many a Statute be caus'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be made,</L>
<L>and this was one amongst them all,</L>
<L>It's treason for a man to find out a mans losse,</L>
<L>and not to restore it to the right owner again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As it chanced there was a rich Merchant,</L>
<L>as he was riding to the market town;</L>
<L>It was his fortune to lose his purse,</L>
<L>and in it there was an hundred pound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Proclamation becaus'd to be made</L>
<L>if any man could find it plain,</L>
<L>Restore to him without any doubt.</L>
<L>and they should have twenty pound for their pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As it chanced there were a sill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> poor man</L>
<L>with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo sheep skins on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is back to sell,</L>
<L>It was his fortune to fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d this purse</L>
<L>and he took i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up and he lik'd it well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When he had took it up into his hand</L>
<L>he needs must sée what in it he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld,</L>
<L>The sum of money he could not u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stand,</L>
<L>bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use there was n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught in the purse but gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou horson villain then said the March<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt</L>
<L>I think it is thou that hast found m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> purse,</L>
<L>Why wilt thou not restore it to me ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in.</L>
<L>which if thou do not thou shalt fare the worse</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My liegh q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth be I found such a pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se,</L>
<L>and gladly to you I'le make it known,</L>
<L>You may have it again it is never the worse,</L>
<L>pay me for the finding and that's my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let me sée what's in it then said the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rchant</L>
<L>he found an hundred pound and no more,</L>
<L>Thou horson villain thou hast payd thy self</L>
<L>for in my purse there was full six score.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But before the King thou shalt be brought,</L>
<L>I warrant you when I come before our King,</L>
<L>He w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll not reward me of with nought</L>
<L>as you your selfe thought to have done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As they were leading him towards the King,</L>
<L>and as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey were going on the way,</L>
<L>There they did méet with a gallant Knight</L>
<L>and with him was his Lady gay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With hugging and tugging this silly poor man</L>
<L>his Leather skins they began to crack,</L>
<L>The g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ding was wanton and leap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</L>
<L>and cast the fair Lady quite on her b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Lady fell down and got a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ones,</L>
<L>no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in at all the poor man did mean,</L>
<L>The Lady did light upon the ground▪</L>
<L>and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ub hath struck out one of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Kni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht would néeds upon him have been,</L>
<L>now stay quoth y<SUP>e</SUP> Merchan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; that is a wrong,</L>
<L>I have an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction already against him</L>
<L>to go the King and he is sure to hang.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As they were leading him towards the King,</L>
<L>the poor man he lik'd not of being le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</L>
<L>But at a sea clift he had thought to have scap'd,</L>
<L>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to have sav'd both himself and them trouble.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As he was leaping at the Sea clift</L>
<L>thinking no harm at al, Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wor,</L>
<L>He met two fishe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to Sea</L>
<L>and the leap broke one of their necks in the boat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The other would needs upon him have been,</L>

<L>We have two actions alread<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against him</L>
<L>and to go to the King he is sure to be hang'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As they were leading him towards the King,</L>
<L>and as they went to the gallery gay,</L>
<L>Here is such a villain then said the Merchant.</L>
<L>as came not before you this many a day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It was my chance to lose my purse,</L>
<L>and in it was there p unds full six score,</L>
<L>The villain wil not give me an hundred again</L>
<L>unless I woold give twenty more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I have worse and that then said the Knight,</L>
<L>I know not what the villain did me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</L>
<L>He caus'd my golding to fling my Lady</L>
<L>and a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ub hath struck out one of her eyne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I have worse and that then saith the Fisher,</L>
<L>I may sigh and say alas God wor,</L>
<L>He met with me &amp; my brother was bound to the sea</L>
<L>and the leap broke my brothers neck in the boat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Solomon</HI> wise he turn'd him about</L>
<L>he was not adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed in every thing,</L>
<L>Never such thrée actions came before me</L>
<L>never since I was crowned King.</L>

<L>I pray you good brother these thrée you do sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</L>

<HEAD>The second Part to the same Tune.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>With all my heart said <HI>Solomon</HI> the wise.</L>
<L>You may h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve the judgement of them yet,</L>
<L>He turn'd them over t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Marquis</HI> his brother,</L>
<L>unto f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iner of them I would have them be quit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Marquis</HI> heard their j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dgements all,</L>
<L>and every one set up his will,</L>
<L>Come hither po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r man, nome hither to me,</L>
<L>and let me hear what thou canst say for thy self.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Leach quoth the poor man, then touching this matter</L>
<L>As I was bound to the market town,</L>
<L>It was my fortune to find this purse</L>
<L>and in it there was an hundred pound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A proclamation be caus'd to be made</L>
<L>if any man could find it again,</L>
<L>Restore it to him without any doubt</L>
<L>&amp; they should have twenty pounds for their pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where is thy witness said the <HI>Marquis?</HI></L>
<L>I pray you let u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hear him soon?</L>
<L>Here is the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rchant's own man,</L>
<L>and carries the message from town to town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Merchant's man then he was call'd,</L>
<L>he swore there was an hundred pound &amp; no more;</L>
<L>And how his Master profered twenty pound,</L>
<L>to any that would to him his purse restore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Saith <HI>Marquis</HI> this shall be my judgement straight</L>
<L>yea, and perhaps you will think it strange,</L>
<L>Thou shalt follow him in the héels every day,</L>
<L>untill thou do find such a bill of Exchange.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And then kéep it to thy self &amp; never give't him again</L>
<L>now God forbid then quoth the Merchant,</L>
<L>How should I find a hundred paund of this</L>
<L>that never had a hundred greats to lose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I had rather give him twenty more,</L>
<L>if so betyde you would let me stay,</L>
<L>Pay down the mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y then quoth the <HI>Marquis,</HI></L>
<L>so mayst thou quietly go thy way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now poor man how hindrest thou this Knight?</L>
<L>thou must néeds make him amends I win,</L>
<L>This is against all Laws and Kights,</L>
<L>the Lady lacke the one of her eyen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hast thou not a wife at home with two ey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s plain,</L>
<L>yea my Liege <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n honest poor woman,</L>
<L>And for her living doth take great pains,</L>
<L>as any one doth in all the town,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This shall be my judgement straight,</L>
<L>yea and perhaps you will think it strange;</L>
<L>The wife with two eyes and the Lady with one</L>
<L>and as thou hall drest her thou shalt exchange.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now God forbid then quoth the Knight</L>
<L>that ever so bad should be my choyce,</L>
<L>I had rather give him an hundred pound,</L>
<L>then to be troubles with his damn'd wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pay down thy money then quoth the <HI>Marquis,</HI></L>
<L>so mayst thou be going within a while,</L>
<L>The Fisher for fear he should be call'd,</L>
<L>he was run away halfe a quarter of a mile;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Was not there a third man then said the <HI>Marquis?</HI></L>
<L>I pray let us hear what he can say?</L>
<L>My Leige quoth they he was here even now,</L>
<L>but as fast as he can he is run away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I pray let him be called b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck again,</L>
<L>if so betyde he be in the fight;</L>
<L>It's never be said you came before me,</L>
<L>but every man shall have his right.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Fisher what made thee to run away?</L>
<L>my Liege quoth he I had a great way home;</L>
<L>And I thought it was time to pack away,</L>
<L>having spent the most of my coyne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Saith this shall be thy judgement straight,</L>
<L>yea and perhaps you will think it strange;</L>
<L>Thou shalt set thy beat in the same stead,</L>
<L>and thou shalt leap at him by way of Exchange.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So mayst thou quit thy brothtrs death,</L>
<L>now God forbid then quoth the Fisher;</L>
<L>That ever so bad should be my chance,</L>
<L>I shal either be drown'd or it wil cause me swound</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I had rather give him twenty pounds,</L>

<LG>
<L>These thrée they could not well agree,</L>

<L>They said they would never come before our King,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The poor man he was well content,</L>
