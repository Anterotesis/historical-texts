<HEAD>❧ A briefe and true Report of S. Anthony Shierlie his iourney in∣to Persia, reported by two Gentlemen who haue followed him in the same the whole time of his trauaile, &amp; are lately sent by him with Lette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s into Englande. September 1600.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Irst, Sir <HI>Anthony Shirley</HI> de∣parting frō England, landed at <HI>Vlishing,</HI> &amp; so went to <HI>Colleme,</HI> from thence to <HI>Frankeford,</HI> then to <HI>Nuremberg,</HI> &amp; so to <HI>Augustus:</HI> Thence taking his Iourney o∣uer the Alpes, he ariued at <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> where he staide two Mo∣neths, &amp; from thence (after ho∣norable Entertainment by the State and Duke of <HI>Venice</HI>) he tooke shiping and crossing the straightes passed the gulfe of <HI>Zante,</HI> so came to <HI>Candie,</HI> then to <HI>Rodes,</HI> and so alongst the coast of <HI>Cipres</HI> to <HI>Antioch</HI> where he landed, and in fiue dayes space marched to A∣leppo and staide there six wéekes: From thence he passed with a Caruan to <HI>Beere</HI> in <HI>Arabia.</HI> There he &amp; his compa∣ny made Boates, &amp; therein passed downe the Riuer of <HI>Eu∣phrates</HI> vnto <HI>Arabia,</HI> where he presented the King with a very rich guift or present. Thence he departed towardes <HI>Babilon,</HI> staide there sixe wéekes, and at last met with a Caruan bounde for <HI>Persia,</HI> in company whereof, he passed the desarts of <HI>Same<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay,</HI> being all sandie and very painefull to passe, and are two Moneths trauail from thence to <HI>Cas∣bine</HI> in <HI>Persia:</HI> At which place he met with the great <HI>So∣phie,</HI> by whom he was most honorably receiued and enter∣tayned.</P>
<P>For before his ariuall (vnderstanding of his comming)
<PB REF="3"/> he sent Horses Leagues for him and his Com∣panie to trauaile vnto <HI>Casbine,</HI> the imperiall cittie of <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> where findeing him on horsebacke (as the manner is) he offered to haue kissed his foot, but the great <HI>Sophie</HI> refu∣sed it, putting his hand betweene Sir Anthony Shirleys Mouth and his Foote. Then did his Maiestie present∣ly appoint a very faire and lardge house fit for him and his Company to abide and rest themselues in, and daylie sent all manner of Dyet vnto him (limmiting him a short time wherein his pleasure was to giue him Audience) at which time Sir Anthony resorting vnto the Court, made his O∣ration in Italian, as followeth.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>¶ The true Coppie of Sir ANTHONY SHIRLIES Oration to the So∣phie, as followeth.</HEAD>
<P>I Am so assuredly frée from any iust imputation, that I will not draw into suspicion so noble a cause (as this of my comming with circumstances,) which though they beare the name, yet are in substance nothing but vncertaine Excuses that betoken a fault: whereas trueth séeketh no starting-holes, but as a Pilgrim (who follow∣eth the motion of his affections) is come from farre, to yéelde and pay vnto vertue his Zeale and Deuotion, and to none other end, if it may please your Maiestie to accept the consecration of his poore Carcas vnto you, which my minde hath caried hither to be made an Offering or hang∣ing vow in the Temple of your most singuler vertues, be∣ing brought to this point by the Extremitie of my desires, with expenses of much time, and not without great perill: which though it be no Present in any degree of woorth esti∣mable to such a Prince: it may please your Maiestie to re∣member, that the pitch of an Eagles flight, doth farre sur∣mount
<PB REF="3"/> the fluttering of a Flie, and that common base Mindes are not Capable of such Noble Thoughtes, as might raise themselues with the true seeking of thiese your most rare &amp; worthie parts, which haue drawn me to your Presence: whereof I haue hearde men speake with wonder, &amp; now they giue me cause to think my selfe most happie. And therefore I humblie beseech your Maiestie, when you haue read the Historie of the inward thoughtes of my minde, you will vouchsafe to iudge hereof, not as of conceiptes hanging of the thréedes of flattering tearmes: but that you will be pleased to vnderstande through the concience of your owne vertues, that wordes of neuer soe great magnificence, are but the least parte of so high and excellent deserte, and that the lesse I am able to display their dignitie with my speaches: the more will I with my Bloude make proofe of my zeale towardes them, if at any time I may be made worthie to be Commaunded by your Maiestie.</P>
<P>I am a Souldier whose profession is cleane contrarie to wordes, which shall sooner faile me, then my courage to greater effect. Yf the present be acceptable to your Ma∣iestie, I shall estéeme it as a most singuler good happe vnto me: but much more, if it shall be imployed. For it would be but a very idle ende and conclusion of so long a trauaile, full of so many perrills, if it were knit vp with wordes on∣ly, and a very poore and slender haruest of so feruent Affe∣ction, if it should bring foorth onely Buddes or Blossomes, and no sounde Fruite: and finally too méeke a Subiect for your Maiesties most excelent vertues, if my deuotion and obseruances were not sealed with my Bloude, the which I do humble and fréely offer at your Maiesties féete, to be shed and spent, at the least signe and token of your Maie∣sties pleasure.</P>

<P>SInce which time, Sir Anthony Shirley hath receiued all the familliar and kinde Entertainment at the great Sophies handes, that coulde possiblie be deuised.</P>
<P>It hapned within a small time after that Sir Anthony Shirley came thither, the Turke sent a very Principall Basha to the great Sophie vppon an Imbassage, after whose comming, the great Sophie dined one day publike∣lie: where he feasted both the Basha, and Sir Anthony and his Company also, placing them on his right hande, and the Basha, and his traine on the left.</P>
<P>The great Sophie hath dealt very gratiously and libe∣rally with Sir Anthony Shierlie during all the time of his being there: for the King intending a iourney from <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssan</HI> vnto <HI>Hastfam,</HI> required Sir Anthony to goe with him, at which time the great Sophie sent him this guift folowing, <HI>(Viz.)</HI> Fortie Horse well furnished, whereof foure Sad∣dles were Plate of Golde, set with pretious Stones, and two of Siluer. Fiftéene Cammels, and as many Mults for his Carriages. Three most faire Tents. Eightéene Carpets curiously wrought with Golde. 16000. Pisto∣lets withall, Cōmaunding his Messenger to tell Sir An∣thony, that the great Sophie woulde not haue him to ac∣cept them as a Present, but as thinges necessarie for his Iourney, (being but for eight dayes,) and euer since he hath bestowed many great guiftes vpon him.</P>
<P>Sir Anthony Shirlie is now at <HI>Prage,</HI> being sent by the Sophie, vpon an imbassage to the Emperour, and diuers other Christian Princes.</P>
