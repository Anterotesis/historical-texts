<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E had rather a great deale (gentle reader) present you with the happy newes of the Articles of Agree∣ment betweene Christian Princes, and that they would once listen to the pru∣dent aduice of our <HI>English Salomon</HI> who labours to make all Countreys happy like his owne, that in his dayes there might bee abundance of peace. But since God is yet pleased for the
<PB REF="4"/> sinnes of Christendome to set euerie mans Sword against his Brother; Wee therefore knowing all men desirous of newes, be it either good or bad, haue purposed (so farre as the power of Au∣thoritie shall licence vs) to publish the weekely occurrences which come to our hands: Our chiefe intention being to stay the vncertaine reports of partiall newes-mongers, who tell euery thing as themselues would haue it; And in this Continuation, though wee cannot hope to make euery reader beleeue what we write, yet neuerthelesse we will not publish any thing, but either from a sure hand, or some relation, seconded and confirmed by others: What we re∣ceiue in doubtfull termes, wee will not report peremptorily, but you shall haue it as we receiue it, neither will we print
<PB REF="4"/> euery report. And although to con∣fesse truth, we wish well, yet that we are not partiall, you may perceiue by our relating this skirmish betweene Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and M<SUP>r.</SUP> <HI>Tilly.</HI> Wee write a continuation, that you may see by the proceedings, that there is good dependancy betweene the relations, wherein we purpose to keepe nere to the Lawes of Historie, to guesse at the rea∣sons of the actions by the most apparant presumptions, and to set downe the true names and distances of places, and times, that you may perceiue, there is probability in the seuerall Atchieue∣ments. And thus much we care not to divulge, for wee feare not that any pamphletter of newes, wil take the like paines: And where wee erre in the termes of Warre, we desire all Gentle∣men
<PB REF="5"/> Souldiers to vnderstand it their way. This we thought good to tell you of: That you may vnderstand what you buy, and thus wee bid you fare∣well.</P>

<HEAD>A CONTINVATION of more Newes from the PALATINATE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter that defeat of the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> and his flight into his owne <HI>Alsatia,</HI> and his iour∣ney thence into <HI>Brisgoia,</HI> to try what forces hee could gather among the <HI>Grisons</HI> and <HI>Swit∣zers,</HI> for the reenforcing of his lost Army: The whole countrey thereabouts, with the Bishopricke of <HI>Spyres,</HI> was left to the deuotion of the King of <HI>Bohemiah,</HI> now by this victory of <HI>Hagenaw,</HI> made sole master of the field; whereupon the <HI>Mansfeldians</HI> made what rauage they pleased in that delicate and most fruitfull countrey: And the Count <HI>Van Hannow</HI> of the lower <HI>Alsatia</HI> (neigh∣bour to <HI>Leopoldus)</HI> taking into his due consideration, that rule of warre; When two powerfull Princes are either declared or engaged in a warre, it hath beene still obserued to be a dangerous thing, for any third man to stand as a neutrall, who is not able against either of them to stand of himselfe: For still the Victor when he hath ouerthrowne the ene∣mies, falls next vpon the weaker Neuters: So that if the Victor has leisure afterward to prosecute them,
<PB N="2" REF="6"/> it is as safe almost, for to haue beene a dependant on the vanquished, as to haue beene onely a looker on: whereas a third man that is of equal power to either of the two <HI>Antagonists,</HI> shall be sure to be solicited by either side; First for his assistance, and if that bee denyed, then seeing hee pleases not to bee a friend, that he would not assist the enemy, neither by suf∣fring any of his troupes to passe through his coun∣trey, nor that the Campe bee supplyed with meat, munition, Armes, &amp;c. from him: And hee may still take his aduantage to chuse whom to side withall; or after the victory he may yet bee welcome to the Victor, or remaine still a Neuter: whereas an inferi∣our Prince, must either come in to the Victor or be ruined, when hee that is too strong for him, pur∣poses to make neutrality occasion of a quarrell. This consideration peraduenture this Count <HI>Van Hannow,</HI> made vse of, which made him offer his seruice to the King: who speedng well, as being re∣ceiued both into friendship &amp; protection, yet so into protection, &amp; vpon such conditions, as free Princes vse to accept a dependancy vpon a stronger party, that is, not to be made a subiect, but an Allie and Confederate: Whose example hath beene such a leading case to others, that a Captaine of much ex∣perience, good intelligence, and able iudgement in those affaires, who (in his letters from <HI>Manhem May.</HI> 22.) hath related this story, infers thus much thereupon in his very next syllables. And I hope (saith he) ere long of a greater fortune.</P>
<P>The 18. of May, they tooke in <HI>Buswester,</HI> next to
<PB N="3" REF="6"/> <HI>Hagenaw,</HI> and in it 250 Centeries of Powder, 200 of Match, with some Bullets, a murthering peece, and certaine other Ordnance. Thence he went to <HI>Cotton</HI> and tooke that in. <HI>Alsatia</HI> thus left behind without an enemie, and with some friends in it, comming neerer home towards the Palatinate; The King &amp; Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> wnet to <HI>Spyers</HI> the chiefe City (and a faire one too) in that Bishoprike; and besides that the very chamber of the Empire, where (by this pas∣sage it seemes) they were as safe, as they had been in <HI>Heidlebergh.</HI> For thither came the Marques of <HI>Baden</HI> to them, where vpon a counsell of War it was agreed that their two Armies should thus seuerally bee dis∣posed of: That the Marquesse <HI>Spiers</HI> being neere his <HI>Baden,</HI> should a while stay to secure those parts either against a revolt, or an enemy that should passe through that way, His Leaguer (a short one though it were) he was to make at <HI>Gersham,</HI> and withall, to block vp <HI>Eddenham,</HI> the only place of the Bishop of <HI>Spiers</HI> in those parts, which it seemes he did in some 7. or 8. dayes; for this agreement being made about the 12. the King passed the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Neckar</HI> with his Army at <HI>Manhem</HI> on the 20. And the Marquesse (hauing all sure at his backe) passed the <HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Germersheim</HI> the 21. to fetch his Army which yet was in his owne Countrey, and about the 23 or 24. was to passe to follow the Kings Army into <HI>Derm∣stadt:</HI> (of which wee gaue you an Item in our last newes printed the 3. and 5. of <HI>Iune.)</HI> But before we tell you what hath there beene done, will you please to take some of the reasons of the invasion of this
<PB N="4" REF="7"/> Country abroad before the Palatinate were cleered of enemies at home. Tis iudged, that now this grow∣ing time of the yeare any Warriour had rather liue vpon his enemies Countrey, then destroy his owne; Againe, for that <HI>de Tilly</HI> is not first medled withall, may be, for that the <HI>Mansfieldians,</HI> thinke it better to fetch their victuall &amp; provision out of this rich and vntouched Countrey, then to lye starving in a Summer Leager, before a full enemie. Againe, the Prince of this <HI>Dermstadt,</HI> though hee bee of the house of the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>Hessen,</HI> who is a <HI>Caluinist;</HI> yet is he a Chatholick, and as some say, a Bishop too, and hath hitherto furnished and befriended the ene∣mies of the Palatinate; which they purpose by this invasion, to disable him from doing hereafter. And there, againe, was the place of meeting appointed be∣tweene the King and the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> the day prefixed being the 26. of May past (after the old stile.) The place, vpon the River <HI>Mayne</HI> towards <HI>Franckford,</HI> as we before told you. And indeed this expedition was chiefly intended to open the passage for him, and withall to hinder the Baron of <HI>Anhalts</HI> comming to <HI>Dirlandt</HI> in <HI>Hessen,</HI> and so to M. <HI>Tilly:</HI> that so by ioyning of 3. faire Armies, the King may bee at once, absolute Maister of the field therabouts, and be able to giue lawes to all <HI>Germanie</HI> if he please: And the Armies kept together, or divided, accor∣ding to their best advantage. But it seemes that the Duke hath something diverted his Armes to pursue other designes. For about the 10. of May he gaue the overthrow to the Baron of <HI>Anhalt,</HI> and slew 2000
<PB N="5" REF="7"/> of his men; which battell, (as the advice from <HI>Cul∣len</HI> written the 19. of May after the old style, sayes) was strooke neere <HI>Soltkott</HI> betweene <HI>Gezek</HI> and <HI>Pa∣derborn.</HI></P>
<P>And next, on the 18. of May he went to <HI>Lisfelt,</HI> where he demanded 150000. dollers of the Can∣nons of the Abbey; and they offered 80000, but how they sped, iudge you. And by letters from the <HI>Hage</HI> the 20. <HI>of May,</HI> it appeares he was since againe at <HI>Hildeshem,</HI> which he hath reduced: And the 26. of <HI>May</HI> being appointed for the meeting with the King about <HI>Frankford;</HI> It seemes that some proiect of his vpon the rich Abbey of <HI>Fulda,</HI> which stands at the Citie of <HI>Fuld,</HI> vpon a riuer of that name too; which is in <HI>Hessen;</HI> about the degrees, 32. 51. This Citie being well watered, is rich in pasture, and in flockes, and especially their commoditie comes in by wooll; which was the reason of the planting of a famous Monastery there, accounted amongst the greatest and richest of Germanie; and amongst them is the Duke; whether to sing Masse or no, I know not. But at this place he was yet about the 28. of <HI>May,</HI> it being some ten or twelue German myles from Franckfort the appointed place of meeting. Yet neuerthelesse the King and Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> (the Marquesse of <HI>Baden</HI> following within three dayes) went on into <HI>Dermstadt;</HI> which iourney was rather a progresse of pleasure, (as if the Army had gone on∣ly to take the ayre) then a warlike expedition; for as they were not medled withall in their march, nei∣ther by <HI>Cordoua,</HI> who (we told you) had sent all his
<PB N="6" REF="8"/> horse to <HI>Tyllye,</HI> nor by <HI>Tyllye</HI> himselfe; who lying to expect some forces of <HI>Bucquoyes,</HI> and <HI>Dampiers</HI> old Regiments, thought himselfe not yet strong enough to disturb them, but kept his leager about <HI>Heidleberg:</HI> So in the country it selfe they found neuer an enemy to resist them; which made the ta∣king in of the towne of <HI>Dermstadt</HI> it selfe, rather a sport then a siege. And in the Castle was the <HI>Landt∣graue</HI> and his sonne with him surprized at vnawares, for he neuer so much as suspected an inuasion; either so secret was that resolution of <HI>Spiers</HI> kept, or hee so secure and negligent. But seing his land full of soldiers: which once discerned not to be his owne, nor his friend <HI>Tillyes,</HI> hee offers an escape; vpon which as if hee had confest guiltie, and something withall vnder his owne hand being shewed against him, he was made prisoner, and brought to <HI>Man∣hem.</HI> This being done as suddenly as hee did that, who wrote <HI>veni, vidi, vici,</HI> that is, in some foure dayes; in which time the soldiers would want no victuals, there being such store of cattle in the coun∣trey, that at the citie of <HI>Franckford,</HI> (as by letters from thence the 26. of <HI>May</HI> appeares) whither these boote-halers droue their pillage, a Calfe was sold for two shillings, &amp; a sheep for one shilling En∣glish, &amp; yet they wanted chapmen at that price too; so that the soldiers are very flush: And vpon the 25 of <HI>May</HI> many thousands of Ricks dollars were ta∣ken vpon the water at <HI>Ouenbach,</HI> by 10. Rijters or horsemen. And it is reported that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> will haue 4. Tunne of gold of these cities herea∣bouts,
<PB N="7" REF="8"/> and the Papists and the Iewes goods with vs in <HI>Franckford,</HI> are like to pay for it. The <HI>Mansfieldi∣ans</HI> have taken here, the Commissioner for the Ene∣mie, who swagger'd it vp &amp; down in his red skarffe, but the red color is now chang'd to Orengetawney, and none of the <HI>Bavarians</HI> or <HI>Spaniards</HI> heere, dare shew their heads. Neither hath this onely made an impression of feare amongst vs, but the Citty and Countrey of <HI>Mentz</HI> have taken the affright also.</P>
<P>And thus, the Country, Citty, Castle, and Land∣grave of <HI>Dermstadt</HI> being taken, and all easily, and all suddenly: The Generall <HI>Mansfield</HI> having intelli∣gence, that M. <HI>Tilly</HI> had receiued those succours which he lookt for, being some 7000. foot and 800. horse, from <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and that withall the Baron of <HI>Anhalt</HI> with some 5000. more, of the forces of <HI>Cullen,</HI> was come vp to him, whereby his Army was become 24000. strong at the least; and withall fore∣casting his purpose to possesse himselfe of the pas∣sages of best advantage, to hinder them in their re∣turne. Hee therefore through his owne, and the Marquesse of <HI>Badens</HI> indisposition of body to fight (having both beene for some dayes before, sicke of the gowt) was not so willing now, as he hath beene at other times, to fly on, and hazard a battell; where the two Generalls were so much disabled from gi∣ving personall directions: But especially hee consi∣dered, that he had something weakned his Army, by putting in of Garrisons into those Townes which he had lately taken in; And that the enemie was more in the field then hee; And that new commers
<PB N="8" REF="9"/> are still forward to venter and put on at first, to get themselues honour and reputation; and he had ra∣ther peradventure let their bravery and fury spend it selfe vpon some light skirmishes with his Reare, which he well knew they would fall vpon; then to force his owne passage through the whole and fresh body of their maine Battalion. Therefore there was this course agreed vpon; That the Prises and Pur∣chases, with all the baggage, &amp; luggage of the Army should be sent home into the Palatinate aforehand, and that the Marquesse of <HI>Baden</HI> should goe before to take the passage over the river <HI>Mayne</HI> at <HI>Reusburgh</HI> some Dutch mile and a halfe below <HI>Frankford;</HI> But the towne belonging to the Marquesse of <HI>Dermstadt</HI> and hauing correspondēcie with <HI>Tilly,</HI> had assurance from him (vpon their sending to him the newes of <HI>Badens</HI> march thitherward) that hee would withall speed come in to their rescue, if the towne Garrison could but make good the place, some few houres. So that the townesmen beeing confident of succours, the Marques perceiuing his passage that way stopt; and that all the Army could not passe the River, be∣fore the enemie would bee ready to fall vpon those that were passing, or not yet passed; came off fairely, and Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> who kept the Reare with the greatest part of the Army, retired in good order and leysure, as beeing before freed of their Carriages. And yet neverthelesse, the Vauntgard of the <HI>Ba∣varians</HI> being come up to the reare of the <HI>Mansfieldi∣ans,</HI> followed them, and skirmished with them, al∣most two daies together; In which to confesse the
<PB N="9" REF="9"/> truth, and no more but the truth; The Generall in∣tending homewards, was vnwilling to turne faces a∣bout, and to make a stand with the whole body of his Army, (so at once to receiue the whole shocke of the battell vpon him) there were some 600. foot, and 60. horse of ours, cut off; And because I would bee impartiall, I haue heere spoken with the most, although those that could wish them ten times so many, will peraduenture at least haue foure times so many slaine; so partiall are many reporters, as some haue not let to giue out, that the Marquesse of <HI>Baden</HI> had the defeat of 15000, &amp; the Archduke <HI>Leopol∣dus</HI> they would haue to loose but 400. But beleeue it, as I heare, so I speake nothing vnder the number of common souldiers heere slaine: And of Com∣manders, on the Kings side, one Colonell <HI>Gulstein</HI> of the Marquesse of <HI>Badens</HI> was kild; a Palsgraue, and a Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> (of the same house with the Ge∣nerall <HI>Mansfield)</HI> are carried hence prisoners; which two great names, will no doubt make a great noyse, being so nere in title to the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> Pals∣graue of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> &amp; to the Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> General of the Army. But to enforme these men: let them know, that all Princes of the Empire haue this pri∣viledge, that their Paternall titles doe descend to all their younger Sonnes; although to keepe vp the house, the Lands are onely entaylde to their eldest. The rest, hauing for their portions, either some pur∣chased Lands, or Summes of Moneyes; and with∣all the honour of Governour of some Countrey or State in the Country; which makes them still both
<PB N="10" REF="10"/> to bee employed and accounted of: Or else, they must make themselues vp a fortune by the Warres. And thus there are at once diuers Dukes of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> diuers Palsgraues of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and diuers Marques∣ses of <HI>Brandenburgh:</HI> the chiefe of which 3. great Families, are distinguished from the second houses, by the addition of <HI>Kurfurst,</HI> or Elector, put to their stiles: And thus is it possible (not comparatiuely to instance in any) that these two prisoners should bee no greater personages, then that Duke of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> whom after the defeat of the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> Colonell <HI>Overtraut</HI> tooke prisoner at <HI>Strasburgh.</HI> On the Enemies party there were many slaine too; and amongst the rest, one braue horse captaine, who being hemd in, did with one Cornet of Horse, aduenture to charge through a whole Regiment of the Marquesse of <HI>Badens</HI> horse: where being opprest with multitude, he was killed, ere he could tell his name; some others are heere prisoners with vs too, men of good fashion, and the best forwardnes in the battell: and this skirmish continued the 29. and 30. of May. The next day the Enemy proud of it to haue had once the better, came on in the heat of blood, and in a brauado presented himselfe in Battalia som∣times, and sometimes in some loose troopes flying vp and downe before the Trenches of the Kings Reare, who had not yet passed the <HI>Neckar</HI> at <HI>Man∣hem</HI> bridge, but were by the River parted from the rest of the Campe. And this they did againe the first of <HI>Iune;</HI> but by their actions wee know not whether they be friends or enemies, for they haue attempted
<PB N="11" REF="10"/> nothing vpon the kings Folke; who lye still, either to be ready to receiue them if they haue the cou∣rage to charge, or else to waite vpon them whither soeuer they stirre. And thus haue wee described enough of the expedition of <HI>Dermstat,</HI> with the aduentures and skirmishes in the returne from thence.</P>
<P>The two Armies lie now at the gaze one vpon another: which it is expected they will not doe long: For there will be extreme hot seruice if either the Duke of <HI>Brunswick</HI> shall come vp hither to ioyne with our two Armies; or shall resolue to march vp into <HI>Bauaria:</HI> which it seemes the two Princes on the Emperors side already stand in doubt of: For the Prince Elector of <HI>Saxonie</HI> musters his troopes in <HI>Turing;</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> makes a Campe at <HI>Dunawert;</HI> which stands vpon the <HI>Donaw</HI> or <HI>Da∣nubius;</HI> and as <HI>Hondius</HI> Map sets it, much about the middle of the borders of the vpper Palatinate, <HI>Baua∣ria</HI> and <HI>Wittenberg.</HI> So that if he goes on, the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> is likelier to haue neede of his owne for∣ces vnder <HI>Mounsieur Tilly,</HI> and to leaue <HI>Don Cordoua</HI> and the Spaniards in the Palatinate, to the mercy of the King of <HI>Bohemiah.</HI> Or if hee comes hither, the King is absolutely and vncontrouleably, Master of the Field. And which of these he next does, the next Post shall bring newes of. In the meane time, he enricheth himselfe wonderfully. The countrey about <HI>Eichfield</HI> so much feares him, that they of∣fered him 100000. Dollers to spare it; but hee askes a farre greater summe.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<P> And thus is this side of Germany, wholy em∣broyled; there being at this time already these Ar∣mies all at once, and all at this present, in the poore Palatinate. First the King himselfe with the Gene∣ral <HI>Mansfields</HI> Forces. Then the Marquesse of <HI>Baden:</HI> both these in the field and ioyned: Then the Gene∣rall <HI>Vere</HI> in Garrison of <HI>Hidlebergh, Manhem</HI> and <HI>Franckendall,</HI> and peraduenture by this time the Duke of <HI>Brunswick</HI> also come, or a comming, and all on our side. On the other side; <HI>Don Cordoua</HI> in the Garrisons; and Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> with his ould Ar∣my of <HI>Bauarians,</HI> and new supplies out of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> &amp; the Bishop of <HI>Cullens</HI> Generall, the Baron of <HI>An∣halt</HI> ioyned with him. And the other side of the Em∣pire, in much suspition of the great preparations of <HI>Bethlem Gabor,</HI> ready either to fall vpon <HI>Bohemia, Austria, Bauaria,</HI> or some other part or Prince of the Empire. So that vnlesse it will please God to giue good successe to those pious endeauours of our gratious Soueraigne labouring for an vniuersal Christian peace; we shall peraduenture shortly see, either <HI>Bauaria</HI> or some parts of the Empire, as miserable as the Palatinate is at this day.</P>
<P>In some letters <HI>May</HI> 20. out of the Palatinate, we had an inckling, that <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> was then almost in a readinesse, and altogether in a resolution to come downe into those parts. And the 22. of <HI>May</HI> were letters written from <HI>Manhem</HI> againe, which re∣ported what they there heard; that <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> was said to be with a great Army marching towards <HI>Bauaria;</HI> And that the Count <HI>de Tourne</HI> (who is on
<PB N="13" REF="11"/> the King of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> side) beganne to stirre on the borders of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and that <HI>Iegerensdorff</HI> Mar∣quesse of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> was as forward as the for∣most.</P>
<P>Now that <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> hath beene all this while quiet, and now beginnes to bussle againe; These reasons haue beene giuen.</P>
<P>The Turkes expedition into <HI>Poland</HI> fayling of that victory which they bragd of before they won; <HI>Bethlem Gabor,</HI> being not supplyed with those for∣ces from the Turkes and Tartars, which were here∣upon drawne out of those parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> and the countenance of the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> vpon which he something depended, being by his retreat, flight, or slaughter of his soldiers, lesse feared in Christen∣dome, and in the Empire for that time; <HI>Bethlem Ga∣bor</HI> was willinger to hearken to those conditions of peace propounded vnto him by the Emperor, so that all the time of the treaty, while the Articles were consulted vpon, and afterward till the time of performance was expected, hee was content to lay downe Armes. But conditions being (as he af∣firmes) not performed on the Emperors part, hee vnwilling that more time should bee gained vpon him, resolues it seemes to fall vpon the Emperor and his friends on that side, while most of his for∣ces are embroyled in a tedious warre, on this. But that you may haue something worth your obserua∣tion, and may not only see the bare euents, but the secret counsels also, of these motions; wee haue here imparted to you a prime peece of intelligence,
<PB N="14" REF="12"/> from a person resident with <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> himself, for the seruice of the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> written to an English Gentleman, a friend of his, in Germanie, and by that Gentleman himselfe translated out of the originall Dutch: whereof these following are the very sillables.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="document">
<HEAD>Concerning the Agreement betwixt the Emperour and the King of Hungarie, it is past on these conditions.</HEAD>
<P>THat the King shall deliuer ouer the Crowne to the States of <HI>Hungarie,</HI> which shall be kept in the Castle of <HI>Trenchshin,</HI> and the King hath appointed six persons to looke vnto it, three of the States of <HI>Transiluania,</HI> and three of <HI>Hungaria:</HI> and at the Dyet or Land-day, which is to be held at <HI>Edenburk</HI> in <HI>Hungarie</HI> the 1. of May, it shall be resolued how the Crowne shall be disposed of.</P>
<P>2. The Emperour shall consigne vnto the King for his securitie, <HI>Cassaw,</HI> the Castle of <HI>Gratz, Warrakin,</HI> the Dukedome of <HI>Oplin,</HI> and <HI>Rateboye</HI> in <HI>Silecia;</HI> and to that purpose for performance are deputed certaine Com∣missioners by the Emperour: but the States of <HI>Silecia</HI> will by no meanes giue consent hereunto. The Emperor, they say, hath promised them to protect and defend them in their priuiledges, and so hath no power for to giue away any of their Country, being against his owne promise.</P>
<P>3. It is likewise agreed that the Emperor shall free 14. townes in <HI>Tzips,</HI> which he hath pawned to the King
<PB N="15" REF="12"/> of <HI>Poland;</HI> but the King of <HI>Poland</HI> will not giue way hereunto.</P>
<P>4. It is agreed, that the Emperor within one moneth, should send to the King of <HI>Hungaria</HI> 4. hundred thou∣sand ducats; but the time is already past, and no money come.</P>
<P>5. It is concluded, that the Emperour as long as he liueth shall remaine King in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and after his death <HI>Bethlem Gabor,</HI> and yet neuerthelesse he also shall haue the name and title of King.</P>
<P>6. The King of <HI>Hungarie</HI> hath likewise reserued to himselfe libertie, to acquaint the Great <HI>Turke</HI> with this agreement, betwixt him and the Emperor; and in case that he will not consent thereunto, but shall goe about to attempt any matter of hostilitie against him for it, the Emperor bindeth himselfe to defend him, and to send vnto him at his requisition, as many forces both of horse and foot, ordnance, or other munition, as shall be ne∣cessarie for his defence. And the <HI>Turke</HI> is not conten∣ted with this agreement; whereupon he hath sent to the Emperor a designation, That is to say, of forty thousand foote, and fifteene thousand horse, 24. great peeces of Ordnance, and fiue hundred Centeries of powder, and ten thousand great bullets, which he desireth to haue forthwith for his defence: but how they will be proui∣ded, let the Emperor take care; so that it is impossible for the Emp. to hold any one of all these Articles: and that the bitternesse betwixt him and the <HI>Hungarians</HI> is like to be far greater then euer. Moreouer, the <HI>Hungarians</HI> haue taken an expresse resolution to visit the Emp. at <HI>Vienna</HI> in Iune next, and for that purpose long for
<PB N="16" REF="13"/> nothing more then to see the grasse and Oates on the ground, that I beleeue there will nothing come of this peace or agreement, which I could likewise confirme vnto you by other arguments, which I am forbidden to trust the feather withall, but you shall shortly receiue aduertisements more at large by word of mouth.</P>

<P>And now (gentle Readers) for that you haue bought what is new, wee giue you what is stale into the match; which is two Letters, one from an Anci∣ent, and another from a Gentleman of a Company; which had they beene published when they were newes, would haue beene much esteemed of: And for that they agree together in so many particulars, and the Ancient was personally in the battels, wee haue here exhibited their owne words; the Gentle∣men to whom they were written, can testifie that we haue not mis-reported them.</P>

<HEAD>The Gentlemans Letter begins thus:</HEAD>
<P>The King crossed the <HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Gernsheim,</HI> with Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> Army, marching towards the Duke of <HI>Bavarias</HI> Forces, then pilling and spoyling the Countrey twixt <HI>Heidleberg</HI> and <HI>Heilbrun,</HI> the 16. of Aprill they approacht and quartered nere the enemy, who lay at <HI>Wisflow.</HI> The 17. in the mor∣ning, the enemie fell vpon <HI>Obertrauts</HI> Regiment of horse, and Colonell <HI>Grayes</HI> Regiment of foot. The Alarum being giuen there, the whole Army drew to their rescue; And as they marched, <HI>Obertraut</HI> was commanded to quit his quarter, and to set it on
<PB N="17" REF="13"/> fire; which being done, the King aduanced vnder the cloud of that smoake, with his Army; whereas the enemy certainly made account he had retyred, but contrary to their expectation he fell on: <HI>Obertrauts</HI> and <HI>Grayes</HI> Regiments changing their retreat into a stout and resolute charge. For halfe an houre there was a doubtfull fight, but the fortune and valour of the King exhorting euery battalion to play the men, who answered him presently by drawing their swords on the Enemy, who at their comming on quailed. Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> sau'd himselfe by the swift∣nes of his Horse. There is a Colonell, a Serieant-Maior, and many Captaines taken Prisoners, and Cornets, and many Ensignes found amongst the dead bodies, which are esteemed to be 3000. men. There was also taken foure peices of Cannon. The Marquesse of <HI>Baden</HI> with his Army marched to cut off the enemies bridge which is at <HI>Wimpfen,</HI> on the <HI>Neckar;</HI> but fayling of that proiect, fell vpon some of their scattered troopes, put many of them to the sword, and tooke 5. peices of Ordnance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="extract">
<HEAD>Which heere now the Ancient confirmes, who was one there himselfe.</HEAD>
<P>The 20. of <HI>Aprill</HI> last the King and Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> with our Army in the Vant, and <HI>Turlach</HI> in the Reare, fought with al the Bavarian forces &amp; put them to flight; we kild in the battle neere 3000. of the Enemie, and af∣ter <HI>Turlachs</HI> Horse in the Reare slew many as they fled, besides many Officers, and men of note which wee tooke
<PB N="18" REF="14"/> prisoners: The K. and Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> charging braue∣ly when the battels ioyned; that twas enough to make a coward valiant. We tooke all their Ordnance they had there, which were sixe peices; where our English beha∣ued themselues so brauely, that the King rewarded many in particular with Gold. We lost in the battle not 200. men, whereof there were but 50. English and Scots: we haue an English troope of Horse which behaued them∣selues wondrous brauely in the fight, but they engaged themselues so far in the enemies Battaliaes, that they lost their Leiutenant, an Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh Gentleman of worth, and Twelue Horsemen more, besides those that were shot, which are ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> liuing; we tooke some 9. Colours and Cor∣nets. <HI>Turlach</HI> with his Army cut off almost two Regi∣ments of <HI>Gonsales</HI> foot, who vpon the newes of the <HI>Ba∣varians</HI> ouerthrow, marched through the hils, towards the remaines of the Dukes forces, but before hee could come, <HI>Turlach</HI> met him, and cut off those men.</P>
<P><HI>Here the difference is onely in</HI> 4. <HI>and</HI> 6. <HI>peeces of Cannon taken.</HI></P>

<P>The 21. the King tooke in <HI>Sintzen,</HI> (which is halfe a daies iourney by Coach aboue <HI>Heidlebergh</HI> towards the Duke of <HI>Wittenberghes</HI> Countrey, and neere to <HI>Wimpfen</HI> and <HI>Wifflow,)</HI> which when the enemie tooke, he put man, woman, and child to the Sword. To this place most of the enemies foote fled for refuge. <HI>Don Gonsales</HI> marched presently with his whole Army to the reliefe of Mounsieur

<DIV2 TYPE="extract">
<HEAD>The Ancient confirmes this report thus.</HEAD>
<P>The 21 of <HI>Aprill</HI> we beleagred <HI>Sintzen</HI> a Towne of the Enemyes, and tooke it in by composition to depart without Armes, and many of them tooke entertaine∣ment with vs, &amp; diuers other Castles and little townes haue yeelded to the King.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="extract">
<HEAD>The Gentleman goes on.</HEAD>
<P>About the 25. of <HI>April</HI> the King left the Mar∣quesse of <HI>Baden</HI> to confront the Enemie, and mar∣ched with his Army through <HI>Heidlebergh,</HI> and sate downe before <HI>Laudenbergh;</HI> which he tooke in on the 28. Most of the soldiers that were there, to the number of 600. haue taken entertainment vn∣der the King Much about that time <HI>Don Gonsalez</HI> and <HI>Mounsteur Tilly</HI> rowted the Marquesse of <HI>Ba∣dens</HI> Army but they bought the victory deate, with the losse of as many men as the Marquesse lost; but they tooke his Cannon and the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of his baggage. His horse playd the lades, and ran away without much losse; which caused his foot to lie close with∣in their Barracadoes till night; and vnder couert of the night fled and gained a wood which was not farre from them; so that the losse is onely in his Cannon and Baggage.</P>

<HEAD>This taking in of <HI>Laudenberg,</HI> and the de∣feat of the Marquesse of <HI>Badens</HI> Armie, The Ancient thus describes.</HEAD>
<P>The 25. of <HI>April</HI> wee beleaguered <HI>Laudenberg</HI> a towne of the Kings that the enemie had tooke in, and man'd it strongly, wee mounted ten pieces, and in two daies and one night, we made a breach that twenty might goe in a front: they of the towne would haue giuen it vp the first day, but the King would giue them no quarter, which made them fight desperatly, knowing no way but death, but the breach being made, the Army threw dice, and the lot fell to the French, who went on so coldly that the English and the Scots got in the towne, crying <HI>Vile∣gainee</HI> of the other side of the towne which made the Garrison soldiers in such a maze that they came running vpon the Pikes at the breach, where were slaine more then two hundred; many of the Officers seeing the towne was won, blew themselues vp wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h gunpowder. And howsoeuer the Kings mercy was such, that after the breach was entered he gaue faire quarters, which they gladly tooke, and most of them tooke entertainment of the King, many of the chiefe are prisoners for ran∣somes, <HI>Turles</HI> with his Army cut off almost two Regi∣ments of <HI>Gonsales</HI> foote, which came to <HI>Tillyes</HI> rescue: But after the same day by negligence, and not well en∣camping, <HI>Turlach</HI> lost 400. men, and was forc'd to retreat, and leaue three peeces of Ordnance behinde him: but not without the losse of as many men on the enemies side.</P>

<P>The First of <HI>May,</HI> the King rose from <HI>Laudenberg,</HI> and passed his Army ouer the <HI>Neckar</HI> and <HI>Rhine</HI> here at <HI>Manheim,</HI> and quartered about <HI>Frankendall, Wormbes,</HI> and <HI>Oppenheim,</HI> where hee lay still two daies, whether to amuse the enemie or no, I know not. His Generall <HI>(Mansfield)</HI> is one of the subtil∣lest men in the world.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="extract">
<HEAD>The Antient confirmes this.</HEAD>
<P>There is an Ambassador come from the Duke of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> who lyeth beneath with a braue Armie; whereupon the King is marched, leauing his Garrisons well man'd, to <HI>Turlach, (the Marquesse)</HI> but Leopol∣dus with his Armie hath beleaguered <HI>Hagenaw,</HI> a braue strong towne of the Bishop of <HI>Spiers;</HI> which caused the King to leaue all and is now gone to releeue it.</P>
