<HEAD>From <HI>Rome</HI> <DATE>the 26. of March 1632.</DATE></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Ere in this Citie of late was very great dis∣quiet and discontent, by reason that the Car∣dinal <HI>Borgia</HI> in the behalfe of his <HI>Imperiall</HI> Majestie, and the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> was very earnest with the Pope, that he would bee pleased to furnish them with monies, and yeeld them all possible assistance in these dangerous, and trou∣blesome times. Which the Pope refused to doe: and because of the Cardinals too too great importunitie, commanded him to forsake the Citie, and not abide there any longer. True it was said he, he knew some good way and meanes to make a setled peace, but to furnish monies he could not.</P>
<P>In <HI>Italie</HI> many Princes doe endevour both by their purse and otherwise to assist the Emperor as much as in them lies. But those of <HI>Savoy, Mantua,</HI> and <HI>Ʋenice</HI> will not bee seene in this businesse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Vienna</HI> <DATE>the 4. of Aprill.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Freedland</HI> at the earnest desire of his <HI>Imperiall Majestie,</HI> hath proffered himselfe to be Generall one moneth longer. It is reported, he hath commanded 30000. men to march toward Generall <HI>Tilly,</HI> As likewise 8000. men march from the Countrie of <HI>Saltsburgh,</HI> who are commanded to <HI>In∣golstad.</HI></P>
<P>There is againe of late great difference risen with <HI>Ragotzi,</HI> and the report is, that he hath besieged <HI>Gaskon.</HI> It seemes be∣cause the Governour of that Citie had the former yeare some
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> intelligence with the <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Hungaria;</HI> the said <HI>Palatine</HI> of a certaine hath written to the Emperor, and certified him that <HI>Ragotzi</HI> with many thousands of Souldiers will fall into <HI>Hungarie.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Prague</HI> <DATE>the 6. of Aprill.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We are now assured and doe perceiue that the <HI>Imperialists</HI> doe from all parts draw their forces together, doubtlesse they haue a great ayme at this Citie, or at some of the Electorall Countries.</P>
<P>A few dayes agoe it was published by sound of the drumme in all the three Cities of <HI>Prague,</HI> that no <HI>Catholickes</HI> upon a∣ny alarum shall dare to shew themselues upon the streetes, or in their windowes upon paine of extreame punishment. But the <HI>Evangellicall,</HI> and Protestants who doe heartily wish well to our cause, are contrariwise commanded to be in Armes, and to appeare upon the Horse-market, in or at the small side-ring. By all likelihood and appearance we may daily ex∣pect the enemie here, for hee often shewes himselfe very strong. Divers of late haue beene imprisoned, because letters were found about them, whereby it did appeare that they had held some correspondencie with the enemie.</P>

<HEAD>An Extract of a letter from <HI>Ausburgh</HI> <DATE>the 7. of Aprill.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The disarming of the <HI>Protestant</HI> and <HI>Evangelicall</HI> Citizens was yesterday put in execution. The same time many woun∣ded and fugitiue Souldiers came from <HI>Donawert,</HI> hither, the Countrey people likewise in all parts flie, and many come for shelter hither. But alas here is but small safetie. Fot the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI> Forces of many Horse are already arrived in this place. His Majestie himselfe with the foot-forces follow neere at hand with the Ordnance, &amp;c. And without any question they ayme at this Citie, which causeth all the chiefe Citizens especially those that are <HI>Romane Catholickes,</HI> to flie and de∣part from hence. Many great Lords hereabouts haue forsa∣ken their Lord-shipps and inheritance, and are fled into. <HI>Ty∣roll.</HI> Also two Companies more of <HI>Bavarian</HI> Forces were sent into this Citie, but we can easily perceiue that they haue no courage to fight.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Ratisbone</HI> <DATE>the 10. Ditto.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Here passe many Forces by toward <HI>Ingolstadt</HI> to Generall <HI>Tillye,</HI> who hath an Armie of 30000. men, The Commaun∣der <HI>Gallas</HI> also is marched toward him with 1500. Horse. The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> as Generall of all the Circles, hath required us to receiue some of his Forces into this Citie, but it was re∣fused. He would very faine be Master of this Bridge, which he shall not obtaine, for we doe very strongly guard the same with our Souldiers. The afore-said Duke causeth all Bridges to be taken and throwne downe.</P>
<P>Vpon Munday last here passed by many thousands of Soul∣diers, but altogether unable and unfit for service.</P>
<P>On the other side of the <HI>Donaw</HI> are also many Forces passed to <HI>Ingolstadt,</HI> most of them came out of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> more fol∣low them. These in their march did pillage all houses and pla∣ces of any worth or note.</P>
<P>The Chauncellor of <HI>Bavaria</HI> is come from <HI>Ambergh</HI> into this Citie with the Bishop of <HI>Bambergh,</HI> with many Abbots Priests, and Spirituall persons. Count <HI>Wolffe</HI> of <HI>Mansfield</HI> is in all speed passed through this Citie to <HI>Ʋienna.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Norimberg</HI> <DATE>the 7. of Aprill.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>You haue formerly heard at large of the taking of the Citie <HI>Donawert</HI> by his Majestie of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the manner of that expedition; wherfore I wil not any further trouble you with that relation. Since that time, it hath pleased Almighty God in like manner prosperously to blesse the said King. Hee hath taken <HI>Dillingen, Lawingen,</HI> and divers others places. The <HI>Imperialists</HI> forsooke also divers places, and brought the keyes of their Cities to his Majestie. Now he is marching towards <HI>Ausburgh</HI> and <HI>Munchen.</HI> Whence the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> is fled with all the Clergie, and at this present is with the Ge∣nerall <HI>Tilly,</HI> who lies with his Armie about and at <HI>Ingolstadt</HI> &amp; <HI>Newburg</HI> neere the <HI>Donaw.</HI> The said Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> hath sent divers Embassadors to his Majestie of <HI>Sweden,</HI> but none of them could obtaine any audience.</P>
<P>His Majestie hath speedily commanded the Generall <HI>Horne</HI> with 2000. horse, and some thousands of foot-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces into
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> <HI>Lower Bavaria.</HI> Almost all the Cities, yea <HI>Munchen</HI> it selfe are resolved to agree with his Majestie upon the best termes they can conclude upon. We doe daily see thousands of spi∣rituall persons flie from all parts, and many of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Army also daily take their heeles and away.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Donawerdt,</HI> <DATE>the 13 Ditto.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The fiue <HI>Swedish</HI> Regiments which passed through here to <HI>Nieuburgh,</HI> are returned backe, not having dispatched what they went about, because 500. <HI>Bavarian</HI> souldiers were brought into that City. In the meane time they and others haue sought their advantage else where, and with Collonell <HI>Sperrutter</HI> haue taken <HI>Lichtenau</HI> and <HI>Papenheym,</HI> and haue blocked vp <HI>Wiltzburgh.</HI> His Maiestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath layd a Bridge over the <HI>Donaw</HI> neare vnto this City, the better to convay the Ordnance and all other necessaries ouer the River. The Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> hath commanded 8. Regiments to <HI>Mun∣chen.</HI> Our souldiers doe dayly ride forth vpon some exploit or other, and no longer since then yesterday, they brought in hither two Ensignes, and many prisoners. The Commaunder <HI>Snedewyn</HI> is placed Gouernour in this City with 8000. men.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Augsburgh</HI> <DATE>the 14. Ditto.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Wee doe here vnderstand, that both Armies of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Tilly,</HI> are within three or foure miles from each other, not farre from this place, neare vnto the Riuer <HI>Lech.</HI> The Generall with the Commander <HI>Altringer</HI> was yesterday here within this Citie, and tooke order for all things, caused also some workes to be made. They haue commanded the Commander <HI>Breda</HI> to encrease this Garrison with 600. horse and 400. foot. But I cannot see how this Citie shall long hold out, and be free from the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who doubtles will very shortly be master not only of this City, but many other.</P>

<HEAD>Out of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> <DATE>the 6. of Aprill.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Whereas there is advertisement giuen to our Prince <HI>Elec∣tor,</HI> that the <HI>Imperialists</HI> doe dayly prepare themselues to as∣sault both himselfe, and the <HI>Marquis</HI> of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> with two seuerall Armies, His <HI>Highnesse</HI> hath commanded all sol∣diers in these Countries to be mustered and in readines at the
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y"/> found of the Drum, also giuen them pay to encourage them, hath also augmented and reinforced the Regiments of foote with 3000. men. The two new Regiments of horse, vnder the Commander <HI>Kaleksteyn</HI> and <HI>Ʋizedum,</HI> are also compleat, and haue taken the oath of fidelity to our Prince <HI>Elector,</HI> which Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> hath now at this present a compleat Army readie, consisting of 9000. horse, and 28000. foote, be∣sides the troupes defensiue, which now he takes along with him into the field.</P>

<HEAD>A Coppy of a Letter written from the Army of his Maiestie of <HI>Sweden,</HI> at <HI>Northeym,</HI> betweene the <HI>Donaw,</HI> and the <HI>Lech,</HI> <DATE>the 14. <HI>Ditto.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>We are here in the field, the Generall <HI>Tylly</HI> hath enscon∣ced himselfe at <HI>Rain,</HI> two leagues from vs, hee hath broken off the bridge and (as he thinks) sufficiently guarded and ensured the Riuer of <HI>Lech</HI> on the other side with retrench∣ments and radouts. Howeuer, It seemes that there is no ap∣prochment to be made without spilling a great deale of bloud. The Kings Maiestie therefore desiring to avoid this bloud∣shedding, endeavours to meet with him another way, and hath caused men to labour strenuously about the bridg which hee causeth to bee layd over the <HI>Lech,</HI> so that yesterday and to day they haue wrought without intermission, and so they continue: doublesse within these two dayes the same will be ready for our men to march ouer. Yesterday very earely his Maiestie went himselfe to view the enemies workes and in what posture he might be, and seeing a <HI>Tillian</HI> Soul∣dier that was then Sentinell; His Maiestie called to him, say∣ing: <HI>Good morrow Monsieur, where is olde Tilly?</HI> The Sentinell gaue answere; <HI>Good morrow to you, Tilly is at Rain in his quar∣ter:</HI> and further hee asked His Maiestie, saying: <HI>Comradoe where is the King?</HI> The King made againe answere: <HI>Hee is now in his Quarter, what doe you else desire to know of him?</HI> The Sentinell answered againe: <HI>Doth the King giue quarter?</HI> The King replyed: <HI>Yes, I assure you; come but ouer to vs, You shal haue good quarter.</HI> Thus the King hauing past about and view∣ed all he did desire, he came backe againe to his quarter, where he made relation of his entertaining of this Sentinell
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> vnto divers Princes and Gentlemen. God be blessed that by his assistance wee haue obtained vnto our power and posses∣sion the whole Bishopricke of <HI>Augsburghs</HI> on this side of the aforementioned river, all the command of the <HI>Donaw,</HI> from <HI>Ʋlm</HI> downward euen vnto <HI>Donaweerdt</HI> for the space and length of 12. Leagues. Beside the cheife Cities and pas∣sages. As namely among others these famous and strong Ci∣ties. The strong City and Castle <HI>Ginsburgh, Lawingen, Hoog∣stadt, Dillingen, Grundelingen, Windelingen, Elchingh, Kir∣bergh, Oberendorf,</HI> and many places more of good hold and moment. In all which places we found for our turne abun∣dance of very excellent good prouision and all things befit∣ting our occasions, especially, wee found there great store of corne and good graines. But wee found very small quantitie of wine, it seemes they cherished their fainting hearts them∣selues withall before their dolefull departure.</P>
<P>Wee doe daily obtaine great store of good bootie, but we cannot sell them, for they will yeeld vs but little money or none at all, a good faire Horse may be bought for foure Rix-dollers, and an Oxe for three Gilders or two Rix-dollers, a Cow for own florince, and a Hogge for a very small vallue, Poulterie, and Geese and the like bare no price, bedding, lin∣nen, cloth, copper-worke, and pewter is of no estimation at all neither any manner of houshold-stuff. Mony is that which is here lookt after. And in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> they are in the very same case. From <HI>Ʋlm</HI> and <HI>Lawingen</HI> and <HI>Hoogstadt</HI> bread and victualls are brought into our Armie in very great abundance ouer the riuer of <HI>Donaw,</HI> and all things are God be thanked ve∣ry cheap. And If wee will complaine, it must bee of plentie otherwise there is no cause. Yesterday in the afternoone a trumpeter was brought blindfolded into his Majesties: quar∣ter and in like manner conducted away, wee vnderstand that his message was to require free passage for the <HI>French Em∣bassador</HI> who now is with the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> to treat with his Majestie concerning very weighty matters. And it is sup∣posed that the enemies would againe intreat for a while ano∣ther cessation of Arme, which I dare presume will never bee consented vnto by his Majestie of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Papenheim</HI> hath almost incorporated the whole Bishop∣pricke of <HI>Paderborn,</HI> and expelled from thence all our for∣ces.

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Hamburgh</HI> <DATE>the 17. Dito.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Because tidings is brought that <HI>Papenheym</HI> is not aboue foure leagues from <HI>Lunenburgh,</HI> all the Swedish troupes meete together and doe intend to joyne forces. Duke <HI>Francis Charses,</HI> the 13. day of this Moneth with both his Regiments passed ouer the <HI>Elbe</HI> to the said Duke.

<P>Letters from <HI>Norimbergh,</HI> dated the 16. of this Moneth-certifie that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath sent his field Mar∣shall to <HI>Bambergh</HI> &amp; <HI>Forsheym,</HI> whither the Marquis <HI>George</HI> should alsomarch to besiedge the same place.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<P>Some Spanish forces (as it is reported) are passed o∣uer the Riuer <HI>Mosel</HI> and as letters do mention, haue taken <HI>Traerbach</HI> and <HI>Limmeren.</HI> The <HI>Rhyne-grave</HI> finding him∣selfe too weake retyred backe, and to strengthen himselfe lightens some forces out of <HI>Dentz</HI> and other Garrisons.</P>
<P>Now presently we have received tydings that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> with his Army is passed over the River <HI>Lech,</HI> the troupes were passing over at noone the 15. of this Moneth, untill the next day in the afternoone late, they marched to <HI>Tierhaubten</HI> by the river <HI>Altha.</HI> We cannot yet certifie you whither he will passe that River or no. It is more probable that he will first march to <HI>Ausburg,</HI> and la∣bour to get the same into his possession The Generall <HI>Til∣ly</HI> is broke up from <HI>Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i,</HI> and durst pot keepe there any lon∣ger but hath forsaken that quarter, being advertised of his Majesties comming, which quarter the <HI>Swedish</HI> have now taken. Wee shall now soone learne whither Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> will give battle to the King. It is supposed that he cannot avoyd, for the King is at the very backe of him, so that a few dayes will resolve this doubt.

<P>His Maiesty of <HI>France</HI> causeth some troupes of horse, &amp; some Regiments of foot to be levyed at <HI>Luyck,</HI> and there is great confluxe, so that he cannot want men. The Drumme beates also for the Emperour, but men have no heart to serve on that side.</P>
<P>His Maiesty is dayly expected at <HI>Versailes.</HI> The feast of the great Popish Iubilye hath beene lately celebrated in <HI>France,</HI> and his Maiesty himselfe with the Queene have
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> both beene in Procession at Saint <HI>German.</HI> Monsieur <HI>De la Force</HI> is yet about <HI>Metz.</HI> Vpon the frontiers of <HI>Germa∣ny.</HI> Duke <HI>De Rohan</HI> is in the <HI>Grisons</HI> Countrey to ensure the passage there into <HI>Italy.</HI> The Alliance of <HI>France</HI> with the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> is very firme, and the <HI>French</HI> will ney∣ther trust the <HI>Spanish</HI> or <HI>Imperialists.</HI> Moreover daily great forces are levyed for the French King, and many troupes sent into <HI>Picardy.</HI></P>
<P>Count <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Nassau.</HI> Count <HI>De Sante Lazar</HI> with 19. Companies of horse, haue convoyd the Colonell <HI>Balanzon</HI> into <HI>Breda</HI> with a Regiment of <HI>Burgunders,</HI> this is a very strong Regiment. The aforenamed 19. Companies mar∣ched from <HI>Breda</HI> to the country of <HI>Luyck,</HI> so forward to march to <HI>Mastricht,</HI> being convoyd with some country∣men, who are two or three thousand strong. Which country people seeing them much wearied were very wil∣ling to assist them, but with this condition, that they should content themselues with such reasonable provision as they should bee able to furnish them withall, of hay, Corne, Bread, Beere, Oates, Victualls, &amp;c. This they see∣med to take contentedly and for very reasonable satisfa∣ction. The Country people dreamt of no harme, neither did they so much as entertaine any euill suspition. But these vndisciplin'd soldiers, were imagining mischiefe all this while, insomuch they did but lay in waite for a seaso∣nable opportunitie, to execute their bloody intentions. For at the last when they saw their time, they fell vppon these poore honest harmelesse country people, and made a bloody massacre amongst them, slew at least 300. of them, and wounded many more of them. Hereupon they sent some certaine Committees to <HI>Bruxells</HI> to make complaint of this miserable and wrongfull slaughter. And being all the fault was laid vpon Count <HI>De Sanct Lazar,</HI> wee doe vnderstand that he is fled and hath betaken himselfe into a Cloister in <HI>Lovain.</HI></P>
<P>The last weeke past there was sent a great summe of money from the <HI>Hage,</HI> to <HI>Dort,</HI> some suppose it to bee for the payment of the soldiers, others are of opinion that
<PB N="10" REF="7"/> the same is to bee imployed about some other vse. But the time will decide the question.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Swarzenburgh.</HI> Embassador of the Prince Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> is departed, from the <HI>Hage,</HI> and againe returned towards <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xells</HI> commissions are granted for the leuying of 60 troupes of horse for the Emperour. But the question is where they will bee had, and how they can bee spared.</P>
<P>His Excellence for the ensuring of the Citty <HI>Grane,</HI> hath caused two seonces to bee built there, one aboue and another below the Citty.</P>
<P>The Secretary of <HI>Iohn de la Gova,</HI> who was sometime Governour of the Castle of <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> was beheaded the 2. of <HI>Aprill.</HI> First, he was accused that he had two wives, thereupon he was apprehended, and afterwards his Coun∣ting house and writings being searched into, it was found out, that there was some private and Clandestine corre∣spondency betweene the Hollanders and him, which strooke the fatall blow.</P>

<HEAD>The true and perfect Relation concerning the maine passage, now expected, and lately happened betweene the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> and the Imperiall Army. Notified by a Letter written from the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> his Army, then encamped about <HI>Ove∣rendorp,</HI> neare the River <HI>Lech.</HI> Which Letter was dated <DATE>the 16. of <HI>Aprill.</HI> 1632.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT hath pleased Almighty God this second time to shew himselfe favourable towards his Church, and to worke a great worke for us. For the passage over the River of <HI>Lech</HI> could not possibly be passed over, without very great difficulty. The reason is because Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> with his whole Army lay on the other side.</P>
<P>This River is not very broad, but runneth very swiftly and is very hardly passed over. His Maj. of <HI>Sweden</HI> being ac∣quainted with the same River, had discryed and taken no∣tice of some place where the River doth circumvent and
<PB N="11" REF="7"/> encompasse some ground, as it were in forme of an Island. His Maj. of <HI>Sweden</HI> did entrench this whole Circle, where two dayes since he caused batteries to be built &amp; raised, &amp; with a retrenchment drew the same to one Lyne, right be∣fore the Island his Mai. caused the Bridge to be layd, and sent some men on the other side with piles there to be fa∣stened. Where also they raised a halfe Moone. Whereupon at severall places the Alarum was strucke up, and the troupes began to march; but whereas yesterday, early in the morning there did rise a very foggy mist, the enemy knew not whither to betake himselfe, nor whereabouts ayme at his adversary. Being in this straite he was constrai∣ned in his iudgment, to place sixe Regiments of his forces, into the Wood neare at hand, where also he raised some batteries against us, and the whole day next ensuing, did play upon us with some reasonable earnestnesse; in the meane time our forces slept not, but with some ready pay∣ment answered them. Insomuch that notwithstanding they tooke the Wood for their shelter, in the upshot a great many dead Corps were left behind them.</P>
<P>Yesterday in the Evening, our Army did perceive that <HI>Tilly</HI> drew backe and retyred all his Baggage, and he him∣selfe in the night fled and went his wayes with all his Troupes. This morning very early, his Mai. hastened over the bridge (which yesterday was ready in good conveni∣ent time) first 300. and afterward 500. horse more, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ought backe suddainly many prisoners. These Prisoners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oe certainly and confidently relate, that <HI>Tilly</HI> himselfe was shot in one of his thighes or legs, and that <HI>Al∣tringer</HI> was shot on the head, and <HI>Merodi</HI> shot dead. The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was himselfe in person with this Army.</P>

<HEAD>Another from the same place <DATE>the same Dito.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>When his Royall Mai. caused the bridge to be layd o∣ver the River <HI>Lech,</HI> he at the same time also caused 62. pie∣ces of Ordnance to be planted upon severall batteries, from the which, he caused the same Ordnance to play continu∣ally. And notwithstanding the enemy did oppose him∣selfe with 4. great Ordnance, and discharged very freely
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> upon us, neverthelesse we lost no more but one Carpenter and one Gunner. Our horsemen did very earnestly pursue their fugitive enemies; insomuch, that they left behinde them aboundance of munition and other commodities. Now <HI>Bavaria</HI> must looke to it, for it is like to suffer.</P>

<P>This day about five of the Clocke, his Maj. of <HI>Sweden</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rived hereabouts with his whole Army, he hath already two Bridges, and one Sconce, and now the Ordnance are intentively placed against <HI>Augsburg.</HI> Those within the City, did very hotly discharge but to no purpose.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bavarians</HI> have already beene constrained to for∣sake and quite relinquish <HI>Nieuburg</HI> and <HI>Rain,</HI> where the <HI>Swedish</HI> found some pieces of Ordnance, and great store of good munition.

<P>We have received certaine intelligence, and full and firme confirmation, by posted Messengers, speedily sent to the Queene of <HI>Sweden,</HI> that since the late passage over the <HI>Lech,</HI> the Generall and Field-Marshall <HI>Horne</HI> doth conti∣nually pursue the fugitive Generall <HI>Tilly,</HI> and that neare unto the City <HI>Aichia,</HI> above 3000. were layd dead upon the very place, and 1500. taken Prisoners. Vpon which bloudy place the Emperialists, and the Generals forces left behind them 6. great pieces of Ordnance, and great store of Munition: His Maiestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> having be∣leaguered or besieged <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gsburgh</HI> with 20000. and also sent 10000. to <HI>Munchen,</HI> divers Cities and places durst no longer stand out, but brought their City keyes, &amp; delivered them up to the said Kings Majesty.

<P><HI>Aichia, Thierhaubten, Hohnweert, Papenhoven,</HI> and di∣vers other places, have yelded up themselves very willing∣ly and freely to his Majesty of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>

<P>The Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> himselfe is fled to the City <HI>Saelden∣tall;</HI> where he hopes to re-assemble and gather together his scattered troupes. Hereof we shall shortly have more certainty.</P>
<P>Through this City and divers other places, from severall parts, many forces passe toward <HI>Mentz;</HI> where the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> his Chancellor <HI>Oxenstiern,</HI> doth assemble toge∣ther 20000. men, to crosse and encounter the <HI>Spanish</HI> for∣ces about the River <HI>Mosell.</HI></P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Mentz</HI> <DATE>the 13. of Aprill.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I doe not doubt but you haue vnderstood the disarming of the Protestants at <HI>Augsburgh,</HI> and therefore I will not tell it you againe, but onely I will shew you what obser∣uations I make in particular about that businesse.</P>
<P>On the 2. of Aprill, by a Proclamation it was forbidden in <HI>Augsburgh,</HI> that none of the Inhabitants there should come abroad out of their houses: And it was then signifi∣ed by the Magistrate vnto a principall protestant there, that Generall <HI>Ossa</HI> had order to come with his Army thi∣ther, vnlesse the vncatholike Burgers (who easily might yeeld to long for, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>) would freely and willingly deliuer vp all their armes, that so a reasonable Garrison might bee assured of them. Now there was then already aboue 1800. foot and some 600. horse in garrison enquartered in the suburbs, and commanded by Count <HI>Otto Henry Fugger,</HI> which Count had giuen his word to the Magistrate in the name of the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> that the garrison should not be encreased; But his word was kept as are all other promises, made by great Officers of the Imperialists and Catholike league.</P>
<P>Howsoeuer the Protestants what by threatnings of the comming of <HI>Ossa,</HI> with an Army; what by faire promises that their Garrison should not be encreased; were endu∣ced and forced, to deliuer vp all their armes, which were fecthed house by house, by some fortie Musquitiers ac∣companied with a waggon, a Clerke and an Officer that were expresly appointed for seuerall streets.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>
<P>Now whilest the Protestants deliuered vp their armes with much discontentment and displeasure, and some with strange protestations and wishes to get them by some or other way back againe; There came newes vnto the Catholick Magistrate, that there was appointed and com∣ming from the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> a new Governour for that Citty, whereby all the Papists receiued as much dis∣pleasure as the protestants had at their disarming. This gaue occasion to both parties to complaine; and as it were to condole and joyne together. Howbeit since that time, there came dayly in more troupes, who being enquartered and lodged in the Protestants houses, made the Papists to bee bold againe and pretend to heare of great wonders that <HI>Tilly</HI> shall doe against the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>Especially there arriued one Colonell <HI>Breda,</HI> who hath the absolute command in the said Citty, which to satisfie more, he presently caused many men to worke in seuerall parts, which worke goes on as well as their Engineers doe order it.</P>
<P>And now we receiue newes, that the King hauing made a bridge ouer the <HI>Lech</HI> in spight and in the sight of the great <HI>Tillian</HI> Armie and killed an infinite number by his Canon (which continually did play vpon the said ene∣mies workes, camp &amp; especially into a little wood, where∣in lay many troupes, expecting to make some exploit, a∣gainst some <HI>Swedes</HI> that went ouer in boates) and enfor∣ced <HI>Tilly</HI> to dislodge without any noyse, from these parts, and to withdraw himselfe with more hast then euer did <HI>Gustavus Hoorn</HI> out of <HI>Bambergh.</HI> The King sent some of his Army towards <HI>Augsburgh,</HI> which he followed himself the next day; whilst some other forces of his, waited on <HI>Tilly,</HI> who hauing forsaken <HI>Newburgh,</HI> is gone towards <HI>Ingolstat,</HI> And so the King (if the letters I receiue say true) arriued himselfe on the 18. of this Moneth neare <HI>Augs∣burgh,</HI> where his presence could not appeare without some present exploit: which was, that his men instantly tooke two forts and the Bridge at <HI>Lechausen</HI> withall.</P>
