<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Diuine Power that inspired the breath of life into man, infused the life of Authoritie in∣to the King. This inspiration maketh man the image of God; that other maketh the King in particular the Lieutenant of God. And there∣fore humane right no sooner stileth one with the name of a King, but diuine Heraldrie graceth him with the title of a mortall God, thereby intimating that it is his chiefest glory, within the sphaere of his Royaltie to imitate the singular gouernment of that power, whose Substitute he is, and with whose name he is honoured. Now the vnparalleled excellencie of diuine gouernment ouer the world is grounded vpon that distinct knowledge which the Creator hath of the nature, con∣dition,
<PB REF="4"/> and vse of all creatures subiect to his gouernment. And surely the readiest way for an earthly Potentate to make his go∣uernment exactly analogicall to that <HI>Jdea,</HI> will be by getting an accurate knowledge of the nature and qualitie of the Land and People ouer which God hath made him his Lieutenant gene∣rall. But the <HI>Metropolis</HI> and the <HI>Royall Throne</HI> require such fre∣quencie of the Soueraignes presence, that such knowledge can∣not be gotten by his owne obseruations. Our Maps therefore (especially being ioyned with discreet obseruations) as they are delightfull unto all, are especially vsefull vnto the King: for by this meanes, though residing in his Princely Seat, he may as the eye from the head, contemplate with much delight and pro∣fit the remotest Territories of his Kingdomes. And because af∣faires of a higher nature take vp the principal of his time, longer Descriptions are not for the purpose; the more compendious, so as accurate, are most sutable to the calling of a King.</P>
<PB REF="4"/>
<P>Vpon these grounds (most dread Soueraigne) am I bold humbly to present these small Chorographicall Descriptions vnto the greatnesse of your <HI>Maiestie.</HI> Their compendiousnesse will free them from being thought troublesome or tedious to your <HI>Maiestie,</HI> and their exactnesse (I trust) will gaine them ac∣ceptation. Howsoeuer, shadowes they are of your Royaltie, and therefore they desire that they (as doth that Body which they represent) may safely repose themselues vnder the wings of your Soueraigntie; To which he commends them, and his loyall seruice, who is</P>

<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F all morall knowledge, the knowing of our selues; of all Ma∣thematicall, the knowledge of our owne Countrey is the most vsefull and profitable. Yet had most men rather spend them∣selues and their precious houres in the most difficult trifles in the world, than once to enter into themselues. And most Stu∣dents in Geographie take more delight to contemplate the remo∣test and most barbarous Countries of the earth, than lightly to examine the Descriptions of their owne. So that (as if like those <HI>Lamij</HI> in <HI>Plutarch,</HI> they had eyes abroad, and inclosed them in boxes in their owne homes) they are accurate in the Descriptions of the smallest village in a forraine King∣dome,
<PB REF="6"/> when they scarce know how the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of their ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Country is situated. The excuses that are ordinary for this common neglect, are, either that accurate Descriptions are wanting, or that they are so voluminous, that they are preiudiciall both to time and purse. But behold (courteous Reader) thou hast here exhibited vnto thee such exqui∣site compendious Surueyes of thine owne natiue Countrey, as will at once take away these excuses, and ease thee of this double grieuance. The Country described, both in regard of Commodities wherewith it is fraught, and places of note wherewith it is graced, is a perfect epitome of the World; these Maps and Descriptions are a compleat epitome of it, and therefore in a double regard worthy thy perusall. And because no Maps can be rightly vnderstood without some insight in the generall termes or notions of Geographie, I haue prefixed a compendious Delineation of the same. If thou readest them, and pro∣fitest by them, I haue the principall of my desire; If thou doest both, with a candid ap∣probation of the Labour, I haue it with Interest.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A DELINEATION OF</HI> the vniuersall Notions of Geographie.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>Eographie</HI> is a Science which teacheth the description, distinction, and dimension of the Earth; and according to the common diuision, is either generall, or speciall; or (as some of our late <HI>Geographers</HI> haue more fitly diuided it) it is either <HI>Sphaericall,</HI> or <HI>Topographicall.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Generall</HI> or <HI>Sphaericall</HI> part of this Science is that which set∣teth forth the naturall constitution of the <HI>Terrestriall Globe.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Terrestriall Globe</HI> is a round body comprehended within the superficies of earth and water, and situated in respect of the other Globes or Starres of the world, according to <HI>Ptolemy</HI> and <HI>Tycho Brahe,</HI> in the Center; but according to <HI>Copernicus,</HI> betweene the Orbes of MARS and VENVS.</P>
<PB REF="7"/>
<P>The parts whereof it consisteth, are either
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Reall,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Imaginarie.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Reall,</HI> are such as agree to the <HI>Terrestriall Globe</HI> by nature.</P>
<P><HI>Imaginarie,</HI> are such as agree to it by vertue of our vnderstanding.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reall</HI> parts of the <HI>Inferiour Globe</HI> are
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Earth.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Water.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Imaginarie</HI> parts are certaine lines which are not, but (for the better vnderstanding of this Science) are supposed to be in the Earth.</P>
<P>These are either
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Straight,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Circular.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST> and of this kinde is only one, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Axell.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Axell</HI> is a strait line passing thorow the middest or center of the Earth, the extremest points whereof are termed <HI>Poles:</HI> the North point is called the <HI>Articke Pole,</HI> and the South the <HI>Antarticke.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Circular Lines</HI> are diuided into the
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Greater,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Lesser.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Greater Circles</HI> are such as diuide the Globe into two equall parts, each whereof contai∣neth in it 360 Degrees, euery Degree being 60 miles; so that the Earth by this computation is 21600 English miles about, and almost 7000 miles thorow.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greater Circles</HI> are three in number,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Meridian,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Horizon,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Aequator.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And these are either
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Mutable, viz.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Immutable,</HI> as the <HI>Aequator.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST> with the mutation of the place, as
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Meridian,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Horizon.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<PB REF="7"/>
<P>The <HI>Meridian</HI> is a <HI>Circle</HI> drawne by the <HI>Poles</HI> of the world, and the verticall point of the place. Of these (though the number set downe in the <HI>Artificiall Globe</HI> at the most be but 180) are there to be supposed in the <HI>Reall Globe</HI> as many as there are <HI>Zeniths</HI> or verticall points from East to West. So places distant East and West haue diuers <HI>Meridians,</HI> (and in this respect it is called a <HI>Mutable Circle</HI>) but places different directly North and South haue the same.</P>
<P>Among these one is of speciall note and use, which <HI>Geographers</HI> commonly call the first and chiefe <HI>Meridian.</HI></P>
<P>The first <HI>Meridian</HI> is that from which the longitude of places from West to East is reckoned. This <HI>Meridian</HI> (according to <HI>Ptolemie</HI> and the Ancients) passeth thorow the <HI>Canary Ilands,</HI> but according to our latter Artists, vpon better reasons, thorow the <HI>Azores.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Horizon</HI> is a Circle comprehending al that space of the Earth which is visible, and distin∣guisheth it from the rest which lieth vnder and is inuisible.</P>
<P>The <HI>Horizon</HI> is either
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Sensible,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Rationall.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Sensible Horizon</HI> is the Circle that terminateth a mans ken looking round about him in an open place; and therefore is greater or lesser, according to the conueniencie of the place wherein a man standeth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rationall Horizon</HI> is a Circle passing by the Center of the Earth, whose two Poles are the point directly ouer a mans head, which is called the <HI>Zenith,</HI> and the point directly vnder his feet, called the <HI>Nadyr.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Rationall Horizon</HI> is that which Geographers reckon among the greater Circles, and not the <HI>Sensible;</HI> but both change according to the change of the place which way soeuer it is.</P>
<P>The vse of this is to discerne the diuers risings and settings of the Starres.</P>
<PB REF="8"/>
<P>The <HI>Aequator</HI> is a great Circle passing thorow the midst of the Earth, and diuiding it exactly into two equall parts or <HI>Haemispheres,</HI> North and South. The vse of it is to shew the latitude of any place; for from it both the Southerne latitude betwixt it and the South Pole, and the Nor∣therne latitude betwixt it and the North Pole is to be reckoned.</P>
<P>The lesser Circles or parallels, are either
<LIST>
<ITEM>named with pecu∣liar names, as
<LIST>
<ITEM>the Tropicks of
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Cancer.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Capricorne.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Polar Circles.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>want such, and they are commonly called <HI>Parallels.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Tropicks</HI> are <HI>Parallels</HI> bounding the Sunnes greatest declination, which is either toward the North, and from the Celestiall Signe is called <HI>The Tropicke of Cancer;</HI> or towards the South, and is from another Signe called <HI>The Tropicke of Capricorne.</HI></P>
<P>Both of these are 23 degrees distant from the <HI>Aequinoctiall,</HI> the one Southward, and the other Northward.</P>
<P>The Polar Circles are <HI>Parallels</HI> compassing the <HI>Poles.</HI> That which compasseth the <HI>North Pole</HI> is termed from the signe of the Beare the <HI>Arcticke Circle;</HI> that which compasseth the <HI>South Pole</HI> is termed the <HI>Antarcticke Circle,</HI> because it is iust opposite to the former.</P>
<P>A <HI>Parallel</HI> compasseth the Earth from East to West, and diuideth it into two vnequall parts.</P>
<P>These foure nominated <HI>Parallels</HI> or lesser Circles serue to describe the <HI>Zones</HI> so much mentio∣ned in the writings of Ancients; the vnnamed <HI>Parallels</HI> to set out <HI>Climates.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Zone</HI> is a space of earth contained betwixt two lesser Circles: the number of them is fiue, whereof two are ouer-cold, one ouer-hot, and two temperate.</P>
<P>The two ouer-cold <HI>Zones</HI> are those parts of the Earth which lie betwixt the two Polar Cir∣cles and the <HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<PB REF="8"/>
<P>The two temperate <HI>Zones</HI> are betwixt the <HI>Tropicks</HI> of <HI>Cancer</HI> and the <HI>Articke,</HI> and betwixt the <HI>Tropicke</HI> of <HI>Capricorne</HI> and the <HI>Antarticke</HI> Circles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Torrid</HI> or ouer-hot <HI>Zone</HI> is that which lieth betwixt both the <HI>Tropicks.</HI></P>
<P>Both the <HI>Torrid</HI> and <HI>Frigid Zones</HI> (though the Ancients thought them to be altogether vn∣habitable) are in many parts at this day well inhabited.</P>
<P>Againe, the Inhabitants in the burnt <HI>Zones</HI> are called <HI>Amphiscians,</HI> for that they haue the meridian shadow on both sides of them, some part of the yeere Northwards, and sometimes Southwards. In the temperate <HI>Zones, Hetoroscians,</HI> hauing the shadow but on one side; and the frigid <HI>Periscians</HI> hauing their shadowes runne round about.</P>
<P>Also the Inhabitants in the same parallel and opposite part of the Meridian are called <HI>Periaecians.</HI></P>
<P>In the like parrallel on the other side of the line and same meridian <HI>Antiaecians.</HI> In the like pa∣rallel on the other side of the line and opposite part of the meridian, <HI>Antipodes.</HI></P>
<P>A climate is a space of earth contained betwixt two parallels, distant from the <HI>Aequinoctiall</HI> towards the North or South Pole: the vse of climats is to distinguish the length and short∣nesse of the daies in all places, for places as they differ North and South, so haue they vnequall daies and nights; the more Northerly climats and places hauing longer daies in the Summer, and longer nights in the Winter than the more Southerly doe enioy.</P>
<P>Thus much of the generall or sphericall part of <HI>Geography.</HI></P>
<P>The speciall or Topographicall part hereof is that which setteth forth the description of the <HI>Terrestriall Globe</HI> so farre forth as it is diuided into distinct parts or places, and is either
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 <HI>The description of some great integrating part of the Earth.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 <HI>Or of some one Region, and so it is properly termed Chorography.</HI></ITEM>
<PB REF="9"/>
<ITEM>3 <HI>Or of some particular place in a Region.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>According to the greater integrating parts thereof, the Ancients diuided the whole world into three parts (no more being then discouered) namely <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>Europa;</HI> but now of late all the world being in a manner found out, the rest is diuided into other three parts <HI>(viz.) Atlantis,</HI> or <HI>America Septentrionall, Meridionall,</HI> and <HI>Terra del Chasdi</HI> or the <HI>South Continent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Asia</HI> is bounded on the North with the <HI>Hyperborean</HI> Seas, on the East with <HI>Mar del Zur</HI> or South Sea, on the South with the <HI>Indian</HI> Seas, and on the West with the Red Sea, part of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, the <HI>Helespont,</HI> and the Riuers <HI>Don</HI> and <HI>Duyna.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Africa</HI> is enuironed with the <HI>Midland</HI> Seas North, the Red Sea East, and the <HI>Aethiopian</HI> and <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, on the South and West.</P>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> is bordered on the East with <HI>Don</HI> and <HI>Duyna,</HI> on the North with the Frozen Seas, on the West with the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and on the South with the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea.</P>
<P><HI>North America</HI> is termined on the East with the North-Sea, on the West with the South-Sea, on the North with the <HI>Hyperborean</HI> or Frozen-Seas, and on the South with the <HI>Isthmos</HI> at <HI>Panania.</HI></P>
<P><HI>South America</HI> is confined on the North with this <HI>Isthmos,</HI> on the South with the Straights of <HI>Magellane,</HI> on the East with the <HI>Aethiopian</HI> Sea, and on the West with <HI>Mar del Zur.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>South Continent</HI> is accosted on the North with <HI>Mar del Zur,</HI> the <HI>Aethiopick,</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Seas. But how it is on the other parts is not yet discouered.</P>
<P>Each of these more spatious parts is againe subdiuided into many Regions, as <HI>Asia</HI> is diui∣ded into these Regions, <HI>Chyna, Tartaria, Muscouia, Georgia, Armenia, Natolia, Syria, Caldea, Arabia, Persia, Magora, India,</HI> and <HI>Cauchychina,</HI> with innumerable Islands called the <HI>Moluccoes</HI> or <HI>Spicerie</HI> Islands and <HI>Iapan,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<PB REF="9"/>
<P><HI>Africa</HI> into <HI>Aegypt, Abyssina, Monomotapa, Magadoxo, Quiloa, Mozambigue, Manicongo, Guynea, Byledulgerid, Barbarie, Cyrenaica,</HI> and <HI>Nubia,</HI> with the Islands of the <HI>Canaryes, Cape-verde, S<SUP>t</SUP>. Helen,</HI> and <HI>Madagasar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> into these Kingdomes, <HI>Crymea, Polon, Sweden, Denmarke, Germanie,</HI> both the higher and lower, <HI>Greece, Hungarie, Bohemia, Austria, Italy, France, Spaine,</HI> with the Islands of <HI>Candy, Corsica, Sardinia, Maiorca,</HI> and these most famous Islands of <HI>Great Britaine,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI></P>
<P><HI>North America</HI> into <HI>Noua Britannia, Noua Albion, Noua Anglia, Virginia, Noua Francia, Florida, Calfornia, Noua Granada, Noua Hispania, Nicoragua,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>South America</HI> into <HI>Castilia del-Oro, Peru, Chily, Guiana, Ouram, Chicas, Brasilia,</HI> and <HI>Pantagones,</HI> with the <HI>Antellar Iles.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>South Continent</HI> (so farre as is discouered) into <HI>Noua Guinea, Luchach, Maletur,</HI> with the Islands of <HI>Salomon.</HI></P>
<P>Againe euery one of these Regions is subdiuided into Prouinces, Hundreds, or Counties. These three kinde of parts make vp the perfect subiect of <HI>Topographie.</HI></P>
<P>Againe euery part and place of the earth is considered either
<LIST>

<ITEM>according to its adiuncts.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In it selfe, and so it is
<LIST>
<ITEM>Continent</ITEM>
<ITEM>Iland.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>A Continent is a great quantitie of land in which many kingdomes and principalities are conioyned together, none of them being separated from the rest by any Sea.</P>
<P>An Island (<HI>quasi</HI> an eie of land, called in Latine, <HI>Insula quasi in salo</HI>) is a part of land com∣passed and enuironed round about with waters, of which <HI>Great Britaine</HI> and <HI>Iapan</HI> are the most spacious.</P>
<PB REF="10"/>
<P>These againe are obseruable parts both of Continents and Islands,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Peninsula.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Isthmus.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Promontorium.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Peninsula (quasi pene Insula)</HI> is a tract of land, which being compassed almost round with wa∣ters, is ioyned by some little necke or <HI>Isthmus</HI> to the firme land, as <HI>Peloponesus</HI> in Greece.</P>
<P>An <HI>Isthmus</HI> is a narrow peece of land which ioyneth the <HI>Peninsula</HI> to the Continent or grea∣ter Islands, as the straights of <HI>Dariene</HI> and <HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Promontorium</HI> is a high mountaine shooting it selfe much farther into the Sea than the Adia∣cent land. The extremest point or nooke hereof is called a <HI>Cape,</HI> as <HI>Cape-verde</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The adiuncts of a place are either such as respect
<LIST>
<ITEM>the earth it selfe.</ITEM>
<ITEM>the heauens.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Those that agree to a place in respect of the earth, are three in number, viz.

<ITEM>1 The magnitude or extent of a Country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 The bounds and limits.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 The qualitie.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1 The magnitude comprehendeth the length and bredth of any place. The length of a place is measured East and West, what figure soeuer the place is of; the bredth thereof North and South.</P>
<P>It is to be obserued that those places that are vnder the <HI>Aequinoctiall</HI> haue no bredth, because that the measuring of latitude is begunne from this circle.</P>
<P N="2">2 The bounds of a Country is a line terminating it round about, and distinguishing it from the bordering lands or waters.</P>
<P N="3">3 The qualitie of a place is the naturall temper and disposition thereof.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His farre famoused Kingdome is bordered on the North with <HI>Scotland,</HI> on the South with the British Sea, on the East with the German Ocean, and on the West with the Hybernian Seas. It is situate in the temperate <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne</HI> and eighth <HI>Climate;</HI> watered with a multitude of Crystall streames, Currents, and Nauigable Riuers; the banks whereof are crowned with Flowrie Mea∣dowes, the Meadowes replenished with abundance of Cattell, and ac∣costed with all manner of fertile fields, of all manner of Corne and Graine; and besides all these affords many other both Commodities and Rarities, which hereafter are particularly expressed in their proper places.</P>
<P>This kingdome was first inhabited by some Colonies which transplanted themselues from the neighbouring coasts of <HI>France</HI> &amp; <HI>Lower Germanie,</HI> as the affinity of their Language, Policie, Religion, and Manners, doe vnquestionably proue; being the ofspring of <HI>Gomer</HI> of <HI>Iaphets</HI> pro∣genie, as their owne appellation doth witnesse, calling themselues <HI>Komery,</HI> who possessed and gouerned this Iland aboue one thousand yeares. About fifty foure yeares before the Natiui∣tie of our Lord and Sauiour, <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> entred this land, which within one hundred and fifty yeares after was subiugated by the <HI>Romans,</HI> vnder whose commands they liued till the 430 yeare after Christ, when the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire declining, was forced to call home their Garrisons, and hauing before exhausted the strength of this Kingdome, left it a prey to the enemie, where∣upon
<PB REF="12"/> the <HI>Picts</HI> assaulting this land thus disfurnished &amp; weakned, they were compelled to craue the aid of the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Anglies,</HI> a warlike nation, inhabiting neare the confines of <HI>Denmarke;</HI> who being ariued, chased away their enemies; and allured with the temperature, fertilitie and pleasantnesse of the Country (flowing in great numbers) expelled the <HI>Britaines</HI> or <HI>Komeros,</HI> that would not liue vnder their lawes and subiection, and so held it till the yeare 1066. when <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour with his <HI>Normans</HI> subdued them, whose successors haue continually en∣ioyed it to this present time.</P>
<P>It was anciently diuided by the <HI>Romans</HI> into three parts, <HI>Britanniam primam,</HI> from the South parts to <HI>Trent; Maximam Caesariensem,</HI> from thence Northward; and <HI>Britanniam secundam,</HI> which we call <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>After by the <HI>Saxons</HI> it was diuided into an Heptarchie, which at last (reduced to a Monar∣chie) was by <HI>Elfred</HI> diuided into Shires, Wapentakes, and Tithings; with Iustices and Sheriffes appointed for ministring of iustice, which partly confirmed, partly altered by <HI>William</HI> the Con∣querour, was at last diuided into 39 Shires of the English, with the addition of 13 of <HI>Wales.</HI> In which are at this present two famous Vniuersities, the Seminaries of vertue and learning; 26 Bishopricks, 641 Market Towees, 186 Castles, 9725 Parish Churches, 555 Riuers, 956 Bridges, 13 Chases, 68 Forests, and 781 Parkes. Tribunalls, or Courts of iustice tempo∣rall, nine, <HI>viz.</HI> Parliament, Starchamber, Chancerie, Kings Bench, Exchequer, Common pleas, Court of Wards, Admiraltie, and Court of Requests, besides Court Leet and Baron. Spiri∣tuall seuen, of Conuocation, Synods, Audience, Arches, Prerogatiue, Faculties, and Peculiar Iurisdictions. Rankes of Nobilitie nine, that is, Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, Viscounts, Barons, Baronets, Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen. And of Inferiour Ranke or Communaltie three, Yeomen, Husbandmen, and Tradesmen.</P>
<P>The Battells by Sea and Land since the Conquest, fought by the Kings, Nobilitie, and Com∣mons, against forraine inuasions, and Domestique and Intestine warres, 76. The last and most Admirable, being in the Chase of the <HI>Spanish Armado,</HI> Ann. Dom. 1588.</P>

Into 20 Hundreds is this Shire shared, which containe in them 326 Parish Churches: and with fiue Riuers is it watered, which are passeable by 24 Bridges. Moreouer with three Forests and 23 Parkes is this County delighted. For Traffique and Trade amongst the Inhabitants, there are seated seuerally 11 Market Townes, whereof the Shire-Towne <HI>North∣hampton</HI> (whence the County carries the name) is of most account, being both large in quantitie, and beautifull in qualitie; for it is adorned with many faire and stately buildings, it is pleasantly seated on the Riuer <HI>Nene,</HI> and (excepting on the Riuers side) was anciently strongly walled with stone; but <HI>Suen</HI> the <HI>Danish</HI> King first fired it, and after that in King <HI>Iohns</HI> time the disloyall Ba∣rons afflicted it, since when hath it not beene free from cruell Fortunes bitter blasts. The ruines of (her sometime strong defence) the Castle stand weather beaten vpon a mount on the West part of the Towne, to shew what it had beene. This Towne is ciuilly gouerned by an annuall elected Maior, two Bailiffes, 12 Magistrates, and a Recorder; the Pole being eleuated 52. 16. and the Lon∣gitude 23. 44.

This County hath beene fortified for defence with ten strong and famous Castles, and likewise plentifully stored with the foundations of many faire and rich Religious Houses, which for their magnificall state in time of their standing, were as so many beautifull ornaments to the Shire; whereas now their dust and ruines are but motiues of pittie to all that passe by them. The Aire in this Prouince is temperate, pleasant, and healthfull; and the Soile fat, rich, and fertile, producing all kinde of the best Corne: And for delightfull Medowes, cheerefull Woods, and pleasant Pastures, the Inhabitants are so plentifully furnish∣ed, as their herds of cattell and faire flocks of sheepe (which both for flesh and fleece cannot be bettered) doe so infinitely multi∣plie, as thereby the Countrey is befitted with all kinde of vsefull and necessary commodities in an abundant manner.</P>

It is but a small Shire, and yet is diuided into 17 Hundreds, which haue in them 165 Parish-Churches, and eight Market Townes, whereof the most famous and euer flourishing Vniuersitie of <HI>Cambridge</HI> is the principall, which is situate on the East side of the Riuer <HI>Caine,</HI> from whence (as some hold) she hath her name; although other Histories of antiquitie deriue it from <HI>Cantaber,</HI> who 375 yeeres before the Incarnation had there setled the Muses seat. And albeit in many Ages this Citie (like many others) hath tasted many wofull fortunes, yet now is it beautified and fairely adorned with sixteene most magnificent Colleges and Halls, full stored with painfull Students, and as euer it hath, so still it doth with abundant increase of most learned and famous Do∣cto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Teachers, and Professors of all Arts and Sciences, enrich not only this our Land, but all others whereto they are dispersed.

And though it be now also dissolued, yet is there remaining the stately Cathedrall of that Dio∣cesse. This County hath had many faire foundations of rich Religious Houses, as at <HI>Beach, Barnwell, Charteres, Denny, Elsey, Shengey, Swasey,</HI> and <HI>Thorney:</HI> but these as well as the rest were supprest and deprest with the weight of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighths hand. Amongst the remarkable things in this County, <HI>Gogmagog Hills</HI> is one, which is neere vnto <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and was a Fort with a Treble Trench raised there by the <HI>Danes,</HI> whose Station it then was.

The <HI>Ordonices</HI> were the ancient Inhabitants of this County, who very stoutly opposed the <HI>Romanes.</HI> And after they were subiugated to the <HI>English,</HI> (by the meanes of <HI>Owen Glendour</HI>) made many rebellious quarrels, to free them∣selues againe from the <HI>English</HI> yoake. Many Wolues in ancient times did abound in the Mountaines of this Countie, which by meanes of King <HI>Edgar</HI> were vtterly destroyed. The Aire here may be healthfull to the Natiues, but it is so continually troubled with violent winds, as it is nothing pleasant. And the Soile so rough and mountainous, that though Corne can thriue there, yet for Grasse and feeding for sheepe, and other Cat∣tell, it is no way defectiue. Herrings are caught also on those Coasts in abundance; and the whole Countie sufficiently stored with Fish and Fowle.</P>
