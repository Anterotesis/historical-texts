<HEAD>TO Sir <HI>Richard Wenman</HI> OF CASSWELL In the County of <HI>Oxford</HI> Baronet.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving had the Ho∣nour to be employ'd in a <HI>Negotiation</HI> be∣tween an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman and the Ancient <HI>Brittons,</HI> I was not only upon the Borders, and (as it were) the <HI>Limbs</HI>

<PB REF="8"/>of his deserved Right, he <HI>flirts</HI> into <HI>Holland,</HI> or is transport∣ed into some Forreign Coun∣trey; where conversing a lit∣tle while, he thrusts into th' World the History of his Ad∣ventures, he <HI>varnisheth</HI> over his Banishment with the Name of Travel, and stiles that his <HI>Recreation</HI> which was indeed his <HI>Punishment,</HI> and so <HI>dig∣nifies</HI> a Ramble by the name of Journey. He tells what <HI>Wonderments</HI> have surpriz'd him, what <HI>Fragments</HI> of An∣tiquity have amaz'd him, what Structures have ravish'd him, what hills have tir'd him; in a word, he is <HI>big</HI> with Descri∣ptions,
<PB REF="9"/>and obliges you with the Narrative of all his Obser∣vations and Notices; seeing every one almost that hath bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>untruss'd</HI> in a Forreign Coun∣try, will have his Voyage re∣corded, and every <HI>Letter-Car∣rier</HI> beyond Sea would be thought a <HI>Drake</HI> or a <HI>Candish</HI> I thought with my self wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may not I have the liberty o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relating my Journey, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> communicating my Observati∣ons to Mankind.

<P>The Cattle we saw most <HI>legible</HI> on their Mountains were Goats and Heifers; a runtish sort of A∣nimals, of a <HI>dwarfish</HI> size, but very <HI>hardy,</HI> of a flinty Constitu∣tion <HI>calculated</HI> on purpose for the <HI>meridian</HI> of a Rock; on which (it seems) they can as heartily feed, as an <HI>Ostrich</HI> on an Anvil. Great numbers of these are often <HI>disembogu'd</HI> into adjacent Coun∣tries, which after some time <HI>cir∣culate</HI> home again in a <HI>stream</HI> of Money; which yields wonderful refreshment to the fainting Domi∣nion,

<P>That which we admir'd most of all amongst them, was the <HI>Virgi∣nity</HI> of their Language, not de∣flowr'd by the mixture of any o∣ther Dialect: The purity of <HI>La∣tine</HI> was debauch'd by the <HI>Vandals,</HI> and was <HI>Hun'd</HI> into corruption by that barbarous People; but the sincerity of the Brittish remains <HI>inviolable.</HI> 'Tis a Tongue (it seems) not made for every Mouth; as appears by an Instance of one in our Company, who having got a Welch <HI>Polysyllable</HI> into his Throat, was almost choak'd with <HI>Conso∣nants,</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="73"/>had we not by clapping him on the back made him <HI>dis∣gorge</HI> a Guttural or two, and so sav'd him. They usually <HI>liques<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the most rugged Mutes, and sof∣ten 'um by Pronuntiation; melt∣ing the word Tug into Tudge a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is clear from this Distick.</P>
<P>Still he did <HI>Tudge</HI> hur Ear</P>
<P>In praise of the <HI>Tirteen</HI> Seer, <HI>i. e.</HI> did <HI>Tug</HI> hur Souses with Elo∣giums of hur Countrey. Whether the Welch Tongue be a <HI>Splinter</HI> of that universal one that was shatter'd at <HI>Babel,</HI> we have some reason to doubt, in regard 'tis un∣like the Dialects that were <HI>crum∣bled</HI> there: However, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be kin or no to other Countrey Speeches, it matters not; but this we are assur'd of, it is <HI>near</HI> and <HI>dear</HI> to the Folk that utter it, who are so passionately fond of it, that they will scarce admit another
<PB N="123" REF="73"/>into the <HI>Embraces</HI> of their Lips, which sputter forth a kind of loathing of our <HI>English</HI> Language; wherein, if a Question be ask'd them, they will with somewhat of disdain and choler make an∣swer <HI>Dim saissonick, i. e.</HI> no <HI>Eng∣lish.</HI> Their Native <HI>Gibberish</HI> is u∣sually pratled throughout the whole <HI>Taphydome,</HI> except in their Market-Towns, whose Inhabitants being a little rais'd, and (as it were) pufft up into <HI>Bubbles</HI> above the ordinary <HI>Scum,</HI> do begin to despise it. Some of these being elevated above the common Le∣vel, and perhaps refin'd into the Quality of having <HI>two Suits,</HI> are apt to fancy themselves above their Tongue, and when in their <HI>t'other Cloaths,</HI> are quite asham'd on't. 'Tis usually cashier'd out of Gentlemens Houses, there being scarcely to be heard even one single
<PB N="124" REF="74"/>Welch Tone in many Families; their Children are instructed in the <HI>Anglican</HI> Ideom, and their Schools are <HI>Paedagogu'd</HI> with Pro∣fessors of the same; so that (if the Stars prove lucky) there may be some <HI>glimmering</HI> hopes that the Brittish <HI>Lingua</HI> may be quite ex∣tinct, and may be <HI>English'd</HI> out of <HI>Wales,</HI> as <HI>Latin</HI> was barbarously <HI>Goth'd</HI> out of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cambro-Brittons</HI> are great admirers of Heroick Actions, and much honour the Memory of Fa∣mous Atchievements; in so much that rather than a <HI>Dead-doing</HI> Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall perish in Oblivion, they will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ernize his Name by the Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ment of a <HI>Straw,</HI> or some such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> considerable trifle; as appears by that Famous Example of that Saint of their Countrey, Bishop <HI>David,</HI> who being a pert fighter and having soundly <HI>basted</HI> and
<PB N="125" REF="74"/>swadled their Foes, is at this day consecrated to Posterity by the <HI>Trophy</HI> of a Leek; and <HI>smells</HI> as rank of Renown from that Vege∣table <HI>Preservative</HI> that Embalms his Fame, as they do of a <HI>Scallion</HI> that carry it about for his Glory. Their Hats are set with this Ani∣versary <HI>Badge</HI> and <HI>Emblem</HI> of Ho∣nour, and triumph on the first of <HI>March;</HI> which Day hath been christen'd by his Name, and being <HI>Dub'd</HI> an Holy-day, hath worn yearly in the Almanack a <HI>Scarlet</HI> Letter.</P>
<P>There is <HI>one thing</HI> more also ve∣ry <HI>observable</HI> among them, and that is, that of all the main'd Persons that ever we read of, we find none comparable for nimble∣ness to a <HI>Cambrian Cripple;</HI> a preg∣nant Proof whereof was present∣ed to us in this following Instance; A Fellow with Crutches mov'd by
<PB N="126" REF="75"/><HI>Protrusion</HI> in a certain Wheel-bar∣row, espying a Bear near the Rere of the <HI>Thruster,</HI> was so surpriz'd with horror at this tremendom sight, that he pack'd up his <HI>Pede∣stals, i. e.</HI> tuck'd his Oaken <HI>Shins</HI> to the <HI>Zodiack</HI> of his Girdle, and away he fled; <HI>Bruin</HI> and the <HI>Pro∣trusor</HI> in vain troop'd after him, who led them a risk with such winged speed, that they could never o're take him; He clearly out-stript them, to the Eternal Glory and Renown of <HI>Welch Lame∣ness.</HI></P>
<P>These are some of the <HI>choicest</HI> Observations we made when con∣versant among the <HI>Brittish</HI> Moun∣tains; we might easily have ad∣ded more, (the whole Nation in∣deed being but <HI>one grand Remark</HI>) had not the suddenness of our Return preyented us. If it should chance to be our Lot to set our
<PB N="127" REF="75"/>Feet on that Soil a second time, we shall venture to present ano∣ther <HI>Show</HI> of it; for 'tis pity such a rare sight as <HI>Wales</HI> should want a <HI>Trumpet,</HI> nay and a <HI>Fool</HI> too to proclaim and expose it to the World.</P>
<P>After we had cram'd our <HI>Budget</HI> with these few Notices, we jog'd on with our Fraught to the Brink of the Sea, where <HI>mounted</HI> on a Pinnace we rode to <HI>Bristol,</HI> from whence with all possible speed we trudg'd in a few days to the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the Nation call'd <HI>London.</HI></P>
