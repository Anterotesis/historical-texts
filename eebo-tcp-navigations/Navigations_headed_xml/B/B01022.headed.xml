<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen the Goldsmith desireth to finde the certaine goodnesse of a peece of golde, which is newly offered vnto hym, he pre∣sently bryngeth the same to the Touch∣stone: whereby comparyng the showe or touche of this newe peece with the touch or shewe of that whiche he knoweth of olde, he forthwith is able to iudge what the valewe is of that, which is newly offered vnto hym. After the exsample wherof I haue thought it good to make some briefe repetition of the perticuler estate of many other forraine Voyages and trades alreadie frequented and knowne vnto vs, wherby you maie be the better able to conceiue and iudge what certaine likeli∣hood of good there is to be expected in the Voyage, whiche is presently recōmended vnto your knowledge and resolution.</P>
<P>And first to laie doune that of <HI>Moscouia,</HI> whose beginnyng is yet in the remembrance of many. It is well knowne that what by the charges of the first discouerie, and by the greate giftes bestowed on the Emperor and his Nobilitie, together with the leaud dealing of some their seruauntes, who thought themselues safe enough from orderly punishment. It cost the Companie aboue fower skore thousande poundes, before it could be brought to any profitable reckoning. And now that after so long a pacience, and so greate a burthen of expences. the same beganne to frame to some good course and commo∣dity: It faleth to very ticklish tearmes, and to as slender like∣lihood of any further goodnesse as any other trade that may be named. For first the estate of those Countreis and the Em∣perours dealinges, are thinges more fickle then are by euery bodie vnderstoode. Next, the Dutchmen are there so crept in, as thei daiely augment their trade thether, which maie well confirme that vncertentie of the Emperours disposition to keepe promise with our Nation. Thirdly, the qualitie of the voyage, suche as it may not bee performed but once the yere. Fourthly, the charges of all Ambassadours betweene that Prince &amp; her Maiestie, are alwaies borne by the Marchants
<PB REF="2" MS="y"/>stocke. And lastly, the daunger of the Kyng of Denmarke, who besides that presently he is like to enforce a tribute on vs, hath likewise an aduauntage vpon our Shippes in their voyage, either homewardes or outwardes whensoeuer he li∣steth to take the opportunitie.</P>
<P>The bad dealynges of the Esterlynges are sufficiently knowne to be suche towardes our Marchaunts of that trade, as thei doe not onely offer them many iniuries ouerlong to be written, but doe seeke all the meanes thei can, to depriue them wholy of their occupiyng that waie: and to the same purpose haue of late, cleane debarred them their accustomed and auncient priuileges in all their greate Townes.</P>
<P>The traffiques into Turkie, besides that by some it is thought a harde poinct to haue so muche familiarity with the professed and obstinate Enemie of Christ: It is likewise a voyage whiche can not bee made but at the deuotion, and as it were in the daunger of many States, who for sondrie re∣spectes are apt to quarrell with vs vppon sudden occasions. And the presentes to be giuen awaie in Turkie this yere cost litle lesse then two thousande poundes.</P>
<P>As for the trades into all the partes of Italie, it maie ease∣ly be considered by euery one of iudgement, that the same stā∣deth in the like termes touching the passages, as that of Tur∣kie, and that many tymes our Shippes beeyng taken in the waie by the <HI>Galleis</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> our poore Mariners after the losse of their goodes and trauaile, are sett at suche excessiue Raūsomes before thei can be freed of their slauerie: as for the most parte thei are no way able to discharge: as for Example at this instaunt there are some prisoners poore ordinary Ma∣riners, for whose releasing there must be paied two hundred Duckets the man, for some three hundred, yea, fower or fiue hūdred Duckets the man for some of thē. And how enuiously thei doe already oppose them selues against our frequenting into their partes, maie appeare by the late customes which thei haue imposed aswell vppon our English Marchaundize whiche wee bryng them, as also vpon suche their Marchaun∣dize
<PB REF="3"/>whiche we fetche from them.</P>
<P>The trade into <HI>Barbury</HI> groweth likewise to worse tear∣mes then before tymes: and when it was at the best our Mar∣chauntes haue beene in daunger of all their goodes thei had there, whensoeuer it happened the Ryng to die. For vntill a new were chosē, the liberty of al discordered persons is such, as thei spoile &amp; wrōg whō thei list without any redresse at al.</P>
<P>Touchyng Spaine and Portugall, with whom wee haue very greate trade, and muche the greater, by meanes of their ventyng a good parte of our wares into their <HI>Jndies,</HI> as also of the prouision thei haue from the same, wherwith are made manye of our returnes from them againe. It falleth out that twise the yere ordinarily we sende our Flates into those par∣tes: So that whensoeuer the Ryng of Spaine listeth to take the opportunity, he maie at these seasons depriue vs not only of a greate nomber of our very good Shippes, but also of our honestest, and ablest sort of Marriners that are to be found in our whole Realme againe: which is a matter of no small con∣sequence: for it is to bee noted, that when he shall take a quar∣rell in hande, though it be but his owne perticulerly, yet hath he the meanes to put in hazarde aswell those our Shippes which are in his owne Countreis of Spaine and Portugall, as also all others whiche shall be bounde to any the partes of all Italie or of Turkie either. And further whosoeuer he bee that is but so meanly affected in Religion, as of necessitie be∣commeth euery ordinarie man and good Christian to be, can not but be agreeued in his harte to consider, that his children and seruaunts whom he desireth to haue well brought vp, are in these trades of Spaine and Portugall and all Italie, for∣ced to deny their owne profession, and made to acquaint them selues with that which the Parentes and Maisters doe vtter∣ly denie and refuse, yea which many of them doe in their own hartes abhorre as a detestable and most wicked doctrine.</P>
<P>But who shall looke into the quality of this voyage, beyng directed to the latitude of <HI>40.</HI> degrees, or there aboutes of that hithermost part of <HI>America,</HI> shal finde it hath as many poinc∣tes
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>of good moment belonging vnto it, as may almost be wi∣shed for. As first it is to be vnderstoode, that it is not any long course, for it may be performed to and from fower monethes, after the first discouery thereof: Secondly, that one wind suf∣fiseth to make the passage; wheras most of your other voya∣ges of like length, are subiect to three or fower winds. Third∣lie, that it is to be performed at all tymes of the yere. Fo∣werthly, that the passage is vpon the high sea, wherby you are not bound to the knowledge of daungers, on any other coast, more then of that Countrey, and of ours here at home. Fift∣lie, that those partes of Englande and Irelande, whiche lye aptest for the proceedyng outward, or homeward vpon this voyage, are verie well stored of goodlie Harbourghes. Sixt∣ly, that it is to be accompted of no daunger at al, as touching the power of any foraine Prince or State, when it is compa∣red with any the best of all the other voyages before recited.</P>
<P>And to the godlie mynded, it hath this comfortable com∣moditie, that in this trade, their Factours, bee thei their ser∣uauntes or children, shall haue no instruction or confessions of Idolatrous Religion enforced vpon them, but contrarily shall bee at their free libertie of conscience, and shall finde the same Religion exercised, whiche is most agreable vnto their parentes and Maisters</P>
<P>As for the Merchandizyng, whiche is the matter especi∣ally looked for, albeit that for the present, we are not certain∣ly able to promise any suche like quantitie, as is now at the best tyme of the <HI>Moscouian</HI> trade brought from thence: So likewise is there not demaunded any suche proportion of dai∣ly expences, as was at the first, and as yet is consumed in that of <HI>Moscouia</HI> and other. But when this of <HI>America</HI> shall haue been haunted and practized, thirtie yeres to an ende, as the o∣ther hath been, I doubte not by Gods grace, that for the tenne Shippes, that are now commonly employed once the yere into <HI>Moscouia,</HI> there shall in this voyage twise tenne be im∣ployed well, twise the yere at the least. And if for the present tyme, there dooe fall out nothyng els to bee founde, then the
<PB REF="4"/>bare Fishyng, yet doubte I not after the first yeres planting, but by that matter only to serue half a dozen of your best sort of shippes, although my supplie of people doe not followe me so substancially, as in all reason maie be well looked for.</P>
<P>But when it is asked what maie bee hoped from thence af∣ter some yeres, it is first to bee considered, that this situation in <HI>40.</HI> degrees, shalbe verie apte to gather the commodities, either of those partes whiche stande to the Southward of it, as also of those whiche are to the Northward.</P>
<P>In the Northerlie maie be expected, not onely an especiall good fishing for Salmon, Codde, and Whales, but also any other suche cōmodities, as the Easterne Countre is doe yeeld vs now: as Pitche, Tarre, Hempe, and therof Cordage, Ma∣stes, Losshe hides, riche Furres, and other suche like, without beyng in any sort beholdyng to a Kyng of Denmarke, or o∣ther Prince or State, that shalbe in such sort able to cōmaund our shippes at their pleasure, as those dooe at this daie, by meanes of their straight, passages, and strong Shippyng.</P>
<P>As for those partes which lye West, and to the Southwar∣des, it maie well be hoped thei will yeeld wines with a small helpe, since the grapes doe grow there of themselues already very faire, and in great abundance. Oliues beyng once plan∣ted, will yeeld the like Oile as Spain and Italy. The Coun∣trey people beyng made to know, that for Waxe and Honie, we will giue them suche triflyng thynges, as thei desire of vs, and shewyng them once the meanes, how to prouide the same, the labour thereof beyng so light, no doubt but in short tyme thei will earnestly care to haue the same in good quan∣titie for vs. Besides what greate likelihoode there is of good meanes to make Salt, which may serue for y<SUP>e</SUP> fishing of those partes, maie well enough appeare vnto them, who can iudge the quality of such places, as are required to make y<SUP>e</SUP> same in.</P>
<P>Thus muche for the beginnyng, because thei may be had with an easie kinde of trauaill. But when it maie haue plea∣sed God, to establishe our people there any suche tyme, as thei maie haue planted amongeste them, in sondrie partes of the
<PB REF="4"/>Countrey, and that by gentle and familiar entreatyng them, thei bee made to see, what is better for them, then thei doe as yet vnderstande of, and that in so many sortes of occasious, as were infinite to be set doune. It is to be assuredly hoped, that thei will daiely by little &amp; little, forsake their barbarous, and sauage liuyng, and grow to suche order and ciuilitie with vs, as there maie be wel expected from thence no lesse quantitie, and diuersity of Marchandize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is spokē vpon the o∣pinion which by some is conceiued that Irelande is not suffeted to be redu∣ced to that perfection whiche it might be, least one dai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by chaunce reuoltyng frō the Crowne it might proue an ouerstrōg partie to be so nere an e∣nemie vnto England.</NOTE> then is now had out of Dutch∣lande, Italie, Fraunce, or Spaigne. And as the borderyng neighbours, are commonly the aptest to fall out with vs, so these partes, beyng somewhat further remote, are the liker to take, or giue lesse occasion of disquiet. But when it is conside∣red, that thei are our owne kindred, and esteemed our owne Countrey Nation whiche haue the gouernement: meanyng by those who shalbe there planted, who cālooke for any other then the dealyng of most louing, and moste assured freendes.</P>
<P>There are further to be considered, these twoo pointes of good importaunce, concernyng the matter of trade. The one is, that by the good prosperyng of this action, there muste of necessitie fall out, a verie liberall vtteraunce of our Englishe Clothes, into a maine Countrey, described to be bigger then all <HI>Europe,</HI> the larger parte whereof bendyng to the North∣ward, shall haue wonderfull greate vse of our saied Englishe Clothes, after thei shall ouce come to knowe the commoditie therof. The like will be also of many other thinges, ouerma∣ny to be reconed, which are made here by our Artificers &amp; la∣bouryng people, and of necessity must be prouided frō hence.</P>
<P>The other is, if there bee any possible meanes, to finde a Sea passage, or other freshe water course, whiche mate serue in some reasonable and conuenient sorte, to transporte our Marchandize into the East <HI>Indian</HI> Sea, through any of these Northerly partes of <HI>America,</HI> it shalbe sonest and moste as∣suredly performed by these who shall inhabite, and first grow into familiaritie with the Inlande people.</P>
<P>What Minerall matter maie fall out to be founde, is a thing least in suspence, vntil some better knowledge, because
<PB REF="5"/>there be many menne, who hauing long since, expected some profites herein, vpon the great promises that haue been made them, and beyng as yet in no poincte satisfied, doe therevpon conceiue, that thei bee but woordes pourposely caste out, for the inducyng of menne to bee the more willyng to furnishe their money, towardes the charge of the first discouerie.</P>
<P>But now to aunswere some others, who beginne with an other obiection, saiyng: That it is not for the Marchauntes purse, to continue the charges of transportyng and plantyng: and that since these hundred menne, whiche are now to bee planted, will coste fower thousande pounde, it is then to bee thought, that the charge of a farre greater nomber, will be al∣so a farre greater some of money. Wherevnto I aunswere, that in all atemptes vnknowne, especially suche a one as is this, wherewith wee are presently in hande, the first charges are commonly aduentured in more desperate kind, then those that folowe vppon some better knowledge: and therewith it falleth out, that whereas one aduentureth in the firste enter∣prise, an hundred for that one will of themselues bee willyng, and desirous to aduenture in the next, if there be neuer so lit∣tle more apparaunce, that the entended matter is by some knowledge of our owne, found true in some poinctes of our firste presumption.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ewer of Mettall brought by Maister Fro∣bisher, caused two seuerall Supplies tho two yeares next follo∣wyng, where∣of the latter was of xiiij. tall Shippes.</NOTE> The examples are many, and maie easily bee remembred by those who bee Marchantes, euen in their ordinarie and daiely trades, as well as in extraordinarie at∣temptes, whiche of late yeres haue fallen into those tearmes of some likelihoode, as is aboue saied. So then no doubt, but when certaine reportes shalbe brought by them, who directly come from thence: that such a Coūtrey and people, thei haue themselues seen, as is by vs spokē of, but that then there will come forwarde a greater nomber of those, who now neither haue hard any thing of the matter, as also of others, who pre∣sently make suche friuolous scruple, as will not otherwise be satisfied, then by the reporte of saincte Thomas. I speak not this by the Marchauntes, whom for their freedomes of trade, I would not haue pressed to any further charge, then this first
<PB REF="5"/>preparacion, but rather by suche as haue great affection, to hazarde the chaungyng of their estates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Fraunces Drake his passedge on∣ly through the Iles of Molucca, was cause of a preparation thither of seuenteene thousande poundes, whereof there was not a∣boue fiue or six thousand in Marchaun∣dize, the rest in other char∣ges of Ship∣pyng and ex∣pensiue pro∣uision.</NOTE> and would be well content to goe in the Voyage, if thei might onely bee assured that there is suche a Countrey, and that their money should not be wasted to nothyng in the preparations. The right exa∣mination of this poincte, must bee the contrary sequell of the common Poruerbe, <HI>Nothyng venture, nothyng haue,</HI> so on the other side by venturyng, many greate good proffites are foūd out, to the wonderful benefite of the common weale, and to those especially in priuate, who take on the hazarde of their life and trauaill, or substance in the first attemptes, and there∣fore I would wishe that thei who (God bee thanked) are well able to spare that, whiche is required of eche one towardes the vndertakyng of this aduenture, bee well content and wil∣lyng to employe the same, since the sequell in good and sub∣stanciall reason dooeth promise, not onely a greate commodi∣tie in perticuler to the Marchaunte, who shall here at home exercise the trade of Marchaundize: But also to an infinite nomber of other, who presently liue in poore estate, and maie by takyng the opportunitie of this discouerie, alter the same to a farre better degree. Wherefore to make some conclusion vpon this poincte of the Marchauntes misdoubt, who suspec∣teth least this first disburcement, without returne of present gaine, should not bee all his charge, but that afterwardes he might yet further bee vrged to continue the like againe, as hath happened in the discouerie of the <HI>Moscouian</HI> trade. It maie suffice to consider, that this is not an action, whiche con∣cerneth onely the Marchaūtes perticulerly, but a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deale more the generall sorte of people throughout all Englande: And that when suche relation shalbe returned, as that it maie bee founde a matter worthie the folowyng, the whole gene∣ralitie will not refuse to contribute towards the furtherance thereof, rather then it should sincke, for wante of any reasona∣ble supplie. But as it is a very little tyme, since I haue been throughlie resolued, to trie my fortune in the matter, so is it more then tyme, the preparation were in hande already, and
<PB REF="6"/>therefore no fit tyme now, to make any nomber of ignoraunt men to vnderstande with reason, the circumstance that belon∣geth to a matter of so greate consideration and importance.</P>
<P>To those who haue any forwarde myndes in wel doyng, to the generalitie of mankinde, I saie this muche more, that Christian charitie doeth as greatly perswade the furtherance of this action, as any other that maie bee laied before vs, in as muche as thereby, wee shall not onely dooe a moste excellent worke, in respect of reducyng the sauage people, to Christia∣nitie and ciuilitie, but also in respect of our poore sorte of peo∣ple, whiche are verie many amongst vs, liuyng altogether vnprofitable, and often tymes to the great disquiet of the bet∣ter sorte. For who knoweth not, how by the long peace, hap∣pie health, and blessed plentifulnesse, wherewith GOD hath endewed this Realme, that the people is so mightely encrea∣sed, as a great nomber beyng brought vp, duryng their youth in their parentes houses, without any instruction how to gett their liuinges, after their parents decease, are driuen to some necessitie, whereby verie often, for want of better education thei fall into sondrie disorders, and so the good sorte of people, as I saied before, are by them ordinarily troubled, and them selues ledd on, to one shamefull ende or other, wheras if there might bee founde some suche kinde of imploymente, as this would bee no doubt but a greater part of them would be with held, frō fallyng into suche vile deedes: and in steade thereof, proue greatly seruiceable in those affaires, where thei might be so imploied. This I speake of myne owne experience, ha∣uyng seen diuers come ouer to the warres of the lawe Coun∣tries, duryng my rsidence in the same, who here had been ve∣rie euill and idle liuers, and by some little continuance with vs, haue growne to bee verie industrious in their facultie, whiche I cā assure you, was a more painfull maner of liuing, then in this action is like to fall out, and withall to a purpose of farre lesse valew, in respect of their perticuler recompēce, then with an assured kinde of good hope is loked for in this.</P>
<P>Thus you see in euery poincte, that maie be wished for, in
<PB REF="6"/>a good action and voyage, there is matter and reason enough to satisfie the well disposed. But now to growe somwhat ne∣rer the quicke, and to showe you some greater apparaunce, then hath been yet spoken of touching the trade whiche is the onely subiect wherwith I doe meane to entermeddle at this tyme, because my addresse hereby is cheifly to mē of such like faculty: you may vnderstāde by that foloweth, the circōstance of a little discourse, whiche doeth concerne these matters ve∣ry directly.</P>
<P>In the yere <HI>1534.</HI> Iames Carthier of Deepe, made his first discouerie of those partes of <HI>America,</HI> whiche lye to the Westwardes, and as it were on the backside of newfounde¦land. In whiche voyage his principall intention was to seeke out the passage, whiche he presumed might haue been founde out, into the East Indian sea, otherwise called the passage to <HI>Cathayo,</HI> but this yere he went no higher, then the Istandes of the assumption in the greate Baie of S. Laureuce, and so returned backe into Fraunce.</P>
<P>The next yere followyng he went with greater prouision into the grand Bay againe, where he keeping the Northerly shore, ranne vp the greate Riuer that comes doune from <HI>Ca∣nada</HI> and other places, vntill at laste with his small Pinaces, hauyng lefte his greate Shippyng by the waie, he ariued at <HI>Fochelaga</HI> Toune, beeyng fiue hundred leagues within the entrance of the grande Baie. In whiche trauaill he had spent so muche of the yere, that it was now the moneth of October, and therefore thought it cōuenient, for the better enformyng hymself at large in this discouerie, to Winter it out in those partes, which he did at a place called by himself holy Crosse. This Winter fell out to bee a verie long and hard Winter, as many tymes the like happeneth with vs in these partes, and the sauage people who for the moste parte, make but a slender kinde of prouision, euen as it were frō hand to mouth fell into some scarcitie of victualles; yet did thei not refuse to serue the Frenchmen, with any thyng thei had all the Win∣ter long, albeit at somwhat higher prices towardes the end,
<PB REF="7"/>when the neede was moste, as with our selues the like happe∣neth at suche tymes. But when the Frenche had had their wantes serued all the yere, and that as yet thei sawe not, any apparance of their entended matter, whiche was the discoue∣rie of the passage, and yet imaginyng by the signes where∣with the willyng people, endeuoured to declare their know∣ledge in that poinct, that some good matter might bee had from them, if thei might haue been well vnderstoode, they re∣solued with themselues, to take some of the sufficientest men of that Countrey home into Fraunce, and there to keepe thē so long, as that hauyng once achieued the Frenche tongue, thei might declare more substancially their mynd, and know∣ledge in the saied passage, concludyng this to be the meane of least charge, of least trauaile, and of least hazarde. And when thei came to bethinke themselues, who might bee meetest for it, thei determined to take the King, as the person who might bee best enformed of suche partes, as were somewhat remote from his owne Countrey, as also that for the respect of hym, the people would be alwaies readie, and content to doe them any further seruice, when it should happen them to retourne thether againe about the discouerie. Thus the poore Kyng of the Countrey, with two or three others of his chief compa∣nions commyng aboard the Frenche Shippes, being requi∣red thether to a bancket, was traiterously caried awaie into Fraunce, where he liued fower yeares, and then dyed a Chri∣stian there, as <HI>Theuet</HI> the Frenche Kynges Cosmographer doeth make mention. This outrage and iniurious dealyng, did put the whole countrey people into suche dislike with the Frenche, as neuer since thei would admit any conuersation, or familiaritie with them, vntill of late yeres, the olde matter beginnyng to growe out of mynd, and beyng the rather dra∣wen on by giftes of many triflyng thynges, whiche were of greate value with them, thei are (as I said) within these two or three yeares content againe to admitte a traffique,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The yere 1581.</NOTE> whiche two yeares since, was begonne with a small Barke of thirtie tunnes, whose retourne was founde so profitable, as the next
<PB REF="7"/>yere followyng, beyng the last yeare, by those Marchauntes, who meant to haue kept the trade secrete vnto themselues, from any others of their owne Countrey men, there was hi∣red a Shippe of fower score tunnes out of the Ile of <HI>Jersey,</HI> but not any one Mariner of that place, sauyng a Shipboye. This Shippe made her retourne in suche sorte, as that this yeare thei haue multiplied three Shippes to bee one of nine score tunnes, an other of an hundred tunnes, and a third of fo∣wer score tunnes: whiche reporte is giuen by very substanci∣all and honest men of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> who sawe the saied Shippes in readinesse to departe on their Voyage, and were aboarde of some of them. Here is at this instant in the towne a man of <HI>Gernesey, Lewis de Ʋicke:</HI> who reporteth to haue credibly heard, that by this last yeares Voyage the Frenchmen got foreteene or fifteene hundred for euery one hundred. But how soeuer it bee, it carieth good likelihoode of some notable pro∣fite, in asmuche as thei doe so greatly, and thus suddenly en∣crease the burthen and number of their Shippes this present yeare. Now, if in so little as two yeares tymes this voyage of the Northerne partes bee growne to suche good passe as hath been declared vnto you: it is worthe the thinkyng on to consider what maie bee hoped for, from the Sotherne parte: whiche in all reason maie promise a greate deale more. And so as one who was neuer touchd with any indirect meanyng, I presume to wishe and perswade you to some better takyng of this matter to harte, as a thing which I doe verely thinke will turne to your greater and more assured commoditie, then you receiue by any other Voyage, as yet frequented of so shorte and safe a course as this hath: dealyng herein no other∣wise with you for your seueral smal sommes, then I doe with my self, bothe for more of myne owne, then is required of any one of you: besides the hazard and trauell of my person, and the total imployment of my poore credite, whiche (I thanke God) hath hetherto passed clere and vnspotted in mat∣ters of greater importaunce and difficultie, then is like to fall out in this betweene you and mee.</P>
