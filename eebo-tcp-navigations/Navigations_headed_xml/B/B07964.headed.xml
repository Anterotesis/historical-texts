<HEAD>A pitiful Relation of the misera∣ble end which a woman made with <HI>her Spouse to whom shee was promised,</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is manifest that mankinde is of its owne nature wicked and giuen to ill, reiecting all manner of good instructi∣ons which are made by the teachers of the Gospell; and amongst diuers other vices, wee perceiue by daily experience, that both the rich and poore are bent to pride, although it be repugnant to the holy Scriptures, and forbidden in the same. It is true, I must confesse, that many of vs reade some∣times the Scriptures, and harken the Ministers of the Word of God, with an intention to amend our liues; but alas, we let those instructions more com∣monly passe through our eares as a wind that com∣meth at the one doore in, and flieth againe out by another doore or window: wee see not sooner a wanton eye, or any other wickednesse, but fall a∣gaine to our former sinne, and thinke no more vpon that which hath bin taught vnto vs. And by reason of this it happeneth, that God sendeth daily many plagues vpon vs, to punish our sinnes, and visiteth vs especially with warre, pestilence and famine. Our mortall Enemy, who runneth continually as a roa∣ring
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>Lion after vs, knowing our wicked inclinations, and that wee make too much of the flesh, seeketh to bring vs into temptations, hoping thereupon to de∣stroy both our bodies and soules: and especially he enticeth vs to pride and vaine glorie, which are none of the lesser sins, and a net to catch vs. For we obserue daily, that many which will flie higher then their wings are able to carry them, come not onely to shame and discredit, but bring their soules also into great miseries and vexations; as amongst other examples may appeare by this following, which happened lately neere the towne of <HI>Hoey</HI> (lying vp∣on the frontiers of <HI>Brabant</HI>) on the person of a daughter of one <HI>Aert Claessen</HI> an Jnne-keeper, who dwelled without the gate of the same towne at the signe of the blacke horse, and had no other children than this daughter, of which he made therefore very much, and spared no cost to adorne her most beau∣tifull body with such gay and rich apparell as shee required. She then being apparelled farre aboue her fathers estate, and set forth as if she were an Earles daughter, grew very proud, and despised all young men and suiters that came to see her. And it happened afterwards, that both her beautie and spightfulnesse or scorne being made knowne to the world by them which had lodged at her fathers house, some three rich Merchants of <HI>Antwerpe</HI> ta∣king their way towards <HI>Francford,</HI> baited at her fa∣thers house. One of them being yet a bachelor, and a very handsome man, was euen at the first sight that he had of her inflamed to loue such a rare beautie:</P>
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<P>And not long afterwards, hauing at seuerall times beene a suiter vnto her, he got at last her good will, and tooke the fruits of loue vpon great oathes and promises made before hand; and went thereupon to her father to get his good liking to the mariage, and spoke in this manner: It is now come so far be∣twixt your daughter and me, that if it pleaseth you we shall be two soules in one bodie: the father li∣king the Merchant very well, said thereupon, None ought to separate them whom God hath conioy∣ned, and therefore if God hath appointed her for you, you shall not want my good will; and added moreouer, that if he would, he might in the pre∣sence of his two friends that came with him, make the spousalls sure both by hand and mouth: He li∣king this motion very well, tooke presently a ring with a <HI>Diamond</HI> from his finger, and gaue it to her saying, Take my most beloued, &amp; receiue my faith∣full promise. This being done, her father made a fore-meale of the wedding to feast the Bride∣groome (as is vsuall in those parts) and his friends. The other two Merchants hauing daily vrged the Bridegroome to dispatch his affaires about the wed∣ding, that they might aduance their iourney; he tooke his leaue from his spouse, and went thereup∣on to her father and mother to doe the like, and de∣sired them that they would take great care both for their daughter and her fruit, if she got any; and promised them againe, that at his returne from <HI>Franckford</HI> he would come to them backe againe, with an intention to marrie their daughter, and to
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>carrie her afterwards to <HI>Antwerpe.</HI> After his depar∣ture came many strange cogitations in the minde of his dearest, and considered by her selfe that if the young Merchant her spouse came not backe againe, that she should be contemned, and blamed all the daies of her life, and that the people would point at her with their fingers and say, looke, there she go∣eth who is now paied for her great pride and spite∣fulnesse: But especially shee troubled her minde, with these and such like cogitations. When she saw that the time was expired which he had appointed for his returne, and would not be appeased by her Parents, who sought to comfort her, saying, Be of a good minde, doe not mistrust your spouse, he is an honest man, and will surely come backe againe, as soone as his affaires will giue him leaue. She grow∣ing then daily more and more desperate, it happe∣ned that she rising early on a Munday, put on her best apparell, and told to her parents with a smiling countenance, that she had but little rest the night before, and that she conceiued in her first slumbring, that the Merchant should not come backe againe; but afterwards being againe fallen into a slumber, her minde gaue her that shee should shortly see her spouse, and I thinke surely that it shall happen, and am therefore now resolued to walke a little abroad to recreate my selfe. Going abroad shee went to∣wards a wood that lay not farre from her fathers house, and espied there a young man comming to her with his rapier on his side, and she thought that he was her spouse: (But alas she was mightily de∣ceiued,
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="y"/>for it was the wicked spirit, who appeared vnto her in his shape and apparell) and bade him welcome with a cheerefull minde: and receiued thereupon a rich scarpe which hee said that hee had brought with him to bestow vpon her; and desired thereupon that shee would yeeld vnto him her young and delicate bodie, for which he had longed a great while. Shee easily yeelding to his suit, went hand in hand with him towards the wood (in which shee yeelded afterwards the vse of her bodie vnto him) and protested by the way, that in his absence shee had fetcht many heauy groanes for his sake. But hee not being contented with her body, made her also to yeeld her soule vnto him; and wrung her head from her necke, (as soone as shee had granted his request) making the whole wood to tremble and shake: and so made this poore wretch a most miserable end of her life, being destituted of the feare of God, and onely giuen to pride, vanity, and worldly care. The father, and mother, longing for the returne of their daughter, learned afterwards by a swineheard what was become of her, for he knew her, and had partly heard and seene this miserable tragedy. They were both at the hearing of this newes much discomforted, and the mother fell pre∣sently into a trance. The next day, the young Mer∣chant comming backe againe found the Parents of his deare beloued in this heauinesse, and asked them where she was; who told him thereupon as well as they could this Historie, and told him that for his loues sake she had beene tempted and murdered by
<PB N="6" REF="7" MS="y"/>the Deuill: he being full of sorrow and griefe, went thereupon out of their house and hung himselfe out of a desperate minde. The Magistrate hauing heard that which was hapned, sent presently the hangman to fetch the body of the Merchant, and caused it to be hanged on a gibbet, as is there the custome of the land. Concerning her body it was buried vnder the gallowes. Her parents died likewise within the space of few daies, being not able to beare such a heauy griefe. This example may moue vs to pray to God that he will giue vs better mindes, and preserue vs from all temptation of the wicked.</P>
