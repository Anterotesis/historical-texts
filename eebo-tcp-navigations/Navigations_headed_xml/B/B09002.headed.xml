<P>THe inclosing of <HI>Jarrowslike</HI> and making Ballast-shores on it, will greatly advantage the River <HI>Tyne</HI> and all Ships Trading to that Port, and be no real Damage to any, unless it be so, to some Perticular Ballast-Wharfs already made on the River in places not so fit for that Ʋse as this will be when tis done: The Preservation of the River, or what may any way damage the Trade of <HI>Newcastle</HI> in general, being intended to be provided for in the Bill.</P>

<HEAD>The Reports and Reasons of the <HI>Trinity-House,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ACCording to Your Majesties Order in Council, bearing date <HI>August</HI> the 5th. We have considered of the Allegations of Sir <HI>Charles Adderly</HI> Knight, and <HI>John Crook</HI> Esquire, concerning the erect∣ing of a Ballast-shoar at <HI>Jarrowes-Slake</HI> near <HI>South-Sheild</HI> in the county o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Duresme;</HI> And do Hum∣bly make our Report that we are of opinion, That a Ballast-Wharf at <HI>South-Sheilds</HI> will be of great use and benefit to all ships Trading in the River <HI>Tine</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or coals, for these Reasons.</P>
<P>First, That it will prevent the loss of ships in their coming for <HI>Tinmouth-bar,</HI> for that they have, and do at this day, cast out great part of their ballast before they come to the bar, so to avoid the great charge after they are in the River of carrying up their ballast in Keels to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> after which meet∣ing with foul Weather, they have many times been cast away by reason of their Lightness.</P>
<P>2ly, It will be a means to secure great ships from the casualties which befall them, by their coming a Ground many have been Lost going up or coming down the River; at Least, it will prevent the wronging of them when they lye on hard Ground or Rocks, going to, or coming from <HI>Newcastle,</HI> where∣by the ships will last the longer; and it will also give them a much quicker dispatch in their Voyages.</P>
<P>3ly, It will be an Encouragement for Men to build great ships for that Trade, such as may be useful for defence of the Kingdom in time of War, and much more proper for that Trade than small Vessels.</P>
<P>4ly, That the Price of taking out the ballast at <HI>Sheilds</HI> being moderately set, It will be a great In∣couragement to Navigation, for that the price of taking it out by the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> is very high.</P>
<P>5ly, That by means hereof Masters of ships may make two or three Voyages more in a year, the charge of taking out their ballast being lessned, and the time of going up the River being saved and their ships hereby the better preserved, and being great Ships most proper for that Trade, they may sell Coals much cheaper to the benefit of the Publick, and get more money to their Owners than now they do, and all this with less hazard; All which we Humbly submit to Your Sacred Majesties most prudent Consideration.</P>
