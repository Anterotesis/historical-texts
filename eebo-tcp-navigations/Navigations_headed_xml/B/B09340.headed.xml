<HEAD>TO THE LADIES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OƲ have in this Romance in <HI>Querpo</HI> (although I believe having read it, you will allow it a better Title, and at least, swear 'tis pity it was not True) the perfect Representation of the state of <HI>Innocence;</HI> I don't mean the time when our first Parents, for want of Drapers, made use of Leaves, but the Age that not long after follow'd; in which <HI>Love,</HI> which is now made a piece of Art, was Natural; when Mens Affections were not byass'd with the Desire of a great Estate, and without huge heaps of Gold were contented with the innocent light∣ness of their Mistresses, I mean that Air, Mine and Gayety they esteem'd, and did not as we do, censure their sprightly Gestures, as if Mirth and Honesty were inconsistent. Then how would they have laugh'd to hear
<PB REF="5"/>of a Lady, that made her Servant follow the Sent two whole Years, when perhaps she is more in love with the Gallant, than he with her, who in his apish Ap∣prentiship (for he must be a Slave to her Will) has spent more Money in the <HI>Mulberry Garden,</HI> and the <HI>Parks,</HI> than would build an <HI>Hospital;</HI> has seen more <HI>Plays</HI> than are good, and been acquainted with all the Coach-men in Town; whose Estate at last being spent <HI>Victoria, Victoria,</HI> the Day's our own, he at last has vanquish'd his Mistresses Affections, is marry'd, and with her Portion is just flush'd for the visit of another Lady; and then who can blame our <HI>Prophetick Gentlewomen?</HI> They are like to enjoy little Pleasure, after the Man in black has conjur'd them together, except to tell how many <HI>Rhenish-wine</HI> Glasses have been drank in drinking her <HI>Health,</HI> by the Good-man her Husband, whow is now perhaps, lest he should for∣get his Courtship, paying his <HI>Devoirs</HI> to new Madam; I know the Ladies having read it (But not for the good of the Book-seller, let us contrive how that may be; why, it is but feeing the Chambermaid to pretend Ignorance, and get the Foot Boy-to buy her the new Book of the Maid that was so Blind as to Lose her self in a <HI>Moon shine Night,</HI> and then convey it to her Lady, who will by the Title, expect it should be horrible Bawdy, when a starch'd Puritan I think would not groan in Spirit to be call'd the Owner of it) I say the Ladies that read it will be cursed an∣gry with me, that <HI>Myrtilla</HI> was so easily gain'd, and that she did not, like our foolish Females, oppose, what she most desir'd. For the first I dare oppose
<PB REF="5"/>her Constancy to any of their Ladyships; and for the other, you shall see I am so much a Gentleman, as to help a young Lady over the Stile. I know her Accusers Argument is, that she ought to have taken some time to try her Servants Affection; but pray direct me to that foolish Fop (and I'le procure him a Mistress of Clouts, for he deserves no better) who when he is wooing, will offer to be deficient in his Duty, that will quarrel at an angry look, and will threaten to bang her if she will not say she loves, which is as ridiculous to think, as that a lame Beg∣gar should Hector out an Alms. For my part, I think our <HI>Myrtilla</HI> is to be commended for her Policy, she does by this oblige her Lover, and he must bely the shape of a man, and be worse than a Devil, that will wrong a Lady that so confidently commits her Honour to his keeping. Well, however the Ladies quarrel at me and <HI>Myrtilla, Circe</HI> and I shall be sure to scape with the Chambermaids, their good hearts will only envy a little her fortune, and it may be say their Prayers every Night, and lie cross-legg'd in expecta∣tion of the like.</P>
<P>It is now fit to tell you why I undertook this harm∣less piece of Mirth, which was for this Reason; I saw how well one Story out of the same Authour took, beeing turn'd into <HI>English,</HI> that is out of the incompa∣rable <HI>Erycius Puteanus,</HI> and thinking this no way infe∣riour to it in it self, having nothing to do, I adventur'd upon the Translation of it. I confess it comes so short of the Pen of that ingenious person that wrote the other, that fear I have done the witty <HI>Italian</HI> an unpardo∣nable
<PB REF="6"/>Injury in daring to render it so pitifully. But to excuse him of all those faults my Translation may make him seem guilty of, I assure you the Cloaths are my own; If you ask why I made 'em no better, I assure you I could not, 'twas done for the aforesaid Reason to avoid idleness, and then I think I am a little more excusable, than the person that having no∣thing to do, went and hir'd in the Market a Drudgery at the expence of a great Sum. If I have offended the Ladies, I beg their pardon, and assure them that I am their</P>

<HEAD>THE MAIDEN-HEAD LOST BY Moon-light. OR, <HI>The Adventure of the Meadow.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y little Skill in Geography will not let me give you any better Account, then that in part of the Dominions of the great <HI>Comus,</HI> dwelt a young Gentleman, by Name <HI>Cherestratus;</HI> I shall not trouble my self nor you with a tedious Relation of his Ancestors, and how many of them were <HI>Lord Mayors;</HI> but I am something like a Woman, and now I think, on't can't but tell you that one of them was hang'd, which I had not done, but that I thought it would not be any disparagement to him, who was
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>so well accomplish'd, that his first actions had quitted the disgrace had they all suffer'd the like fate; He was not at all behind hand with the Gallants of these times, either for Learning or Valour, besides Sing∣ing, and composing of Madrigals, which seemed in those days to have been in great use; for the Ladies being not over coy, were not so great Enemies to the Progress of Musick, as to deny themselves or Servant the pleasure of an early <HI>Serenade,</HI> which the next day was rewarded with some signal favour, except the Lady so courted had been wak'd out of some pleasant Dream, and then too she durst hardly chide, for fear left being out with the men (who where chiefly concern'd in the Comedy) her Dream should prove but a Dream, and she should never be made happy with the Reality. Besides this, he could Dance incomparably well, by which the Ladies might ghess he had not been under the Surgeon's hands, nor had much skill in <HI>Maiden heads</HI> (a thing very much to be deplor'd in our days, for our Gal∣lants not finding the first night what they look for (but they are fools that do) seldome continue Lo∣ving above the first Month; and seem not so much to be married as to keep a Mistress with a little more Ceremony. I am loath to tell you that with these Perfections he was rich, for I would be unwilling to put in any thing that might make you suspect the truth of this Relation, and I am sure you will never believe, that a person so well accomplish'd, and of a sufficient Estate should find so cruel a Lady, as not to admit of his Addresses. But you must consider the
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>time which according to the best Chronologers was in <HI>Tiresias</HI>'s days, and the women would not deny his Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> That they take as much pleasure or more in doing the Gentleman a good turn▪ than the person that receiv'd it, This made the Ladies then, contrary to what they are now a days, count it an unpardonable Sin to take a Reward for their mutual pleasures, and this made <HI>Cherestratus</HI> not prove so successfull in his Amours, as he might have done had he liv'd now.</P>
<P>But to come to the Story, it was the unhappiness of this incomparable Gallant, to place his Affection on a Person that disdain'd his frequent Suits, which she did with a kind of Reluctancy, for she her self nor any body else could tell why she would not let him pay his <HI>Devoirs</HI> to her, as well as any other Gal∣lant of the Town, to whom he was no way inferiour. But the mysteries of Love are as blind as himself, whose hidden Causes can never be understood, and I should rather be content to be kept in ignorance, then endeavour of a discovery of <HI>Medea's Video me∣liora proboque, Deteriora sequor.</HI> However the Lady continued very obstinate, whether because she was prepossess'd with the Love of <HI>Hyleus</HI> (Rival only in Love to our noble <HI>Cherestratus,</HI> for, for other things he could not stand in competition with him) or for some other Reason, I know not. For I do not think that the comparing of a Ladie's Favours to Shadows always holds true, for then <HI>Hyleus</HI> had been as un∣happy as our unfortunate Gentleman, who ply'd his Business as hotly as <HI>Cherestratus</HI> could possibly do.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<P>By this time <HI>Cherestratus</HI> was grown a perfect Vo∣tary of Love, which made him like the rest of that mad Religion abandon the society of men, and en∣deavouring as it were to be free from himself, he would often be singing some lamentable Ditty, of which he had store, but above all, this was the chief:
<Q><L><HI>Whatever I think or whatever I do,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My</HI> Phillis <HI>is still in my mind:</HI></L>
<L><HI>When in anger I mean not to</HI> Phillis <HI>to go</HI></L>
<L><HI>My feet of themselves the way find,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now you'l say this is very like a modern Song of ours, but I assure you what follows, could I but re∣member it, was not at all like it, and it was only by chance, that he thought of the first Stave, for it is certain there are common notions, which are obvious to all that make upon the same Subject. In hitting on which some have been so happy, that they have wrote whole Poems, and things of greater bulk so like other men, that if compar'd, it was not easily told which was which. But let this pass, sometimes you should have our <HI>Inamorato</HI> under the reverend shade of a well spread Oak, beseeching it's senseless Divinity to give him leave to inscribe the Name of his dear <HI>Myrtilla</HI> there (for so was the hard-hearted Lady call'd,) and then taking out a Pen Knife, which had never been put to any servile office, as cutting of Corns, or the like, he ingraves on the bark with flou∣rishing Letters, which searce a Writing Master in those parts could mend, the Name of his Saint. This
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>done like a meer heathenish Gentleman he falls down, and worships the work of his own hands; then with a tedious Harangue he twits the poor Tree in the teeth of the benefit he had done it, saying that it should be now more famous for bearing the Name of the incomparable <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> then it was for <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and that were not corn yet found out, he might not at all fear a rape of his ripe Acorns, for as soon as people came, and saw those Letters, rapt up in admiration, they would forget to eat, and with fixed eyes gaze till some envious Dryades forc'd 'em from their De∣votion. Besides these works of supererogation, our Gallant (which was the only comfort he had) was almost continually walking by the door of the cruel Lady, whom he seem'd to watch or rather guard with as much diligence, as <HI>Argus</HI> did <HI>Io,</HI> or the mortify'd Ghost of some lately departed Usurer his musty baggs, but yet he durst not (as being forbid by his Mistress, and fearing to displease her) hang Garlands at her Posts so artificially woven with Enigmatical Flowers, that she might there read his fervent af∣fection. This and several other Love-tricks that the Youths of those times us'd, to accomplish their wishes, he was forc'd to forbear.</P>
<P>His Friends by this began to have small hopes of his Estate, or Legacies; for his not eating nor drink∣ing any thing, made them suspect he was grown im∣mortal. Amongst the rest of his acquaintance one <HI>Paneutus</HI> a Yeoman ith' Country some ten miles of the City where our pining Lover now was, hearing of the deplorable condition his Friend lay in, and
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>being himself a boon Companion, did not doubt, but if he could get him into the Countrey, he cou'd make him quit his humour. To effect which he wrote this Letter.</P>

However, I am so far Interess'd in you, as my second self, that knowing a Remedy, I could not but prescribe it you, which being follow'd will either make you happy with your Love, or without it.

</LETTER>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<P>This Letter in <HI>Cherestratus</HI>'s absence, arriv'd at his City House, who was just now gone, as his custome was, to take a view of his Lady's Lodgings, which he did so eagerly, that he had like to have paid for his gaping. For some of the Neighbours observing him how narrowly he ey'd the House, thinking he had some bad design, acquainted the old Gentlewoman, Mother to the young Lady; who could hardly be perswaded from carrying our Gallant before the Justice, to which her Daughter encourag'd her, which went to the very heart of <HI>Cherestratus,</HI> for she knew well enough though she seem'd ignorant of the cause. But the old Lady, having no witness to prove any thing, dismiss'd him, with a severe charge never to trouble her door again. What remains now to the desperate Lover, but to make away with him∣self, and fall a Sacrifice to her disdain? which cer∣tainly he had done, had not his hasty desire to visit <HI>Myrtilla's</HI> House made him forget to put on his Shash, that morning. A thousand miserable thoughts offer'd themselves to him in his way home, whither he was no sooner come, but throwing himself upon his Bed, he began to bewail his hard fortune, with tears and sighs. Scarce had he begun his Soliloquy, but his Ser∣vant came into the Room, and presented him with the Letter; which having read, and taking a turn or two in the Chamber, the reflecting on his Lady's inci∣vilities made him resolve to accept his Friend's Offer. To which end setling his Houshold Affairs, he com∣mands all things to be made ready for his next days intended Journey, which accordingly he took, wisely
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>choosing rather to ride a mile about, then to come by <HI>Myrtilla's</HI> House, by which he should have passed; being safe come to his journey's end we will leave him with his merry Friend <HI>Paneutus,</HI> who entertain'd him with all the kindness imaginable, always en∣deavouring his diversion with some pastime, as Hawk∣ing, Hunting, and the like, and return to <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> whose Mother you must know, knowing what care and caution is to be us'd over young Maids, made the Daughter grow weary of her Government, counting it too severe, as depriving her of those Pleasures that young Ladies would willingly accept of. For her Mother keeping a Dairy would often set her to make Butter and Cheese for fear of the green Sickness, which he knew how to cure as well as any Doctor in <HI>Europe,</HI> had her Mother been as willing as she, where∣as she had rather have been reading of some brisk Romance, or Story of the strange Metamorphosis of a Maid into a Woman. Besides her Mother began now to oppose <HI>Hyleus</HI>'s Visits, the only comfort her Daughter had, for she being a pretty while in her Teens, had the same desire as all her Contemporaries had, to mind nothing but the end for which they were made, which caus'd her, encourag'd by her Mothers rigour, to think on some way to obtain her desires, and free her self from the old Lady's Tyran∣ny, which was very much encreas'd since the death of her Husband, to whose Education he left his Girl <HI>Myrtilla.</HI></P>
<P>Long you may imagine she had not studied before she found out a Plot (for Women's Wits on such
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>occasions are very quick, and for my part I believe that had not <HI>Jupiter</HI> quickly put in Execution his golden Project, <HI>Danae</HI> for all the Tower would have found the way to his Embraces:) well a Plot is now found, which was this, to venture her Maiden-head into <HI>Hyleus</HI>'s hands, rather then endure the slavery she was in. This she resolv'd to put in practice, and contrary to a Woman, kept constant too. But she saw no way of effecting it without making some body privy to it, and then she thought no one fitter then her Maid <HI>Circe,</HI> a loving Girle, and welwisher to Gen∣tlemen, for before she happen'd into her Mistresses Service, she waited on a Lady, and like the rest of that trade, very often chose before her Mistress, other∣wise she would not speak a good word for a Gallant. <HI>Myrtilla's</HI> Mother being call'd to a Womans Labour, she thought it a very fit time to communicate her De∣sign to her Maid. Where upon coming down to look for <HI>Circe</HI> she found her in the Garden tumbling on a Camomile bed, lying on her back a Star-gazing, but seeing her young Mistress starting up she quickly quitted that posture, and ask'd her if she had any service to command her. Ah <HI>Circe</HI> (said she sighing) I have, could I but be assur'd of thy Secrecy. Of mine, Madam? (reply'd <HI>Circe</HI>) why, there be a great many Gallants in Town, would be Surety for me if need requir'd. Why, 'tis the only thing I am good for. Why then (said <HI>Myrtilla</HI> sitting down with her Maid) you must needs have observ'd how my Mother pryes into all my Actions, debarring me of all I take delight in. I have now thought how to mend this,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>would'st thou consent to aid and assist me. <HI>Circe,</HI> who now thought she should get an opportunity to be reveng'd on her old Mistress for making her rise so early, not admitting of her Sweet-hearts company, and hindring her from wearing her best Clothes, and going to Church a Sunday (for let me tell you Preaching is of very old standing) made all Protesta∣tions possible to give her Mistress a good opinion of her Secrecy, which <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> being put to a strait, soon believ'd, and ask'd her what she thought of running away with <HI>Hyleus,</HI> without her Mothers consent. To which <HI>Circe</HI> answered, I believe he is an honest Gen∣tleman, and were it to me I should take his word; now all the difficulty will be to make him acquainted with the Design. For that too (crys <HI>Myrtilla</HI>) I've contriv'd, and now my Mother's out of the way thou shalt be the happy Messenger to inform my dear <HI>Hy∣leus</HI> of mine Intent. I am certain he will gladly em∣brace the opportunity, which I would never have given him, but that I'm confident his Honour will not let him stain mine. Mad <HI>Circe</HI> would have taken up her Mistress, but the short time she had, fearing her Mother's return, would not let <HI>Myrtila</HI> admit of her fooling. Take here said she, this Jewel (in which was neatly wrought in Diamonds) the Story of the Rape of <HI>Proserpine</HI> by <HI>Pluto,</HI> (and you cannot imagine <HI>Hyleus</HI> so much a fool as not at first sight to under∣stand the Hieroglyphick) which I have got wrought on purpose. Deliver it to him as a token of my Affe∣ction (dear Creature) and tell him I shall with impa∣tience expect his coming to fetch me away at Night.
<PB N="11" REF="11"/><HI>Circe,</HI> who was not a stranger to these Love Embas∣sies, willingly apply'd her self to her Task immediately, took her Pattins and away to <HI>Hyleus,</HI> who was not at home just when she came, but the Servants told her he would be presently. It was the Butlers fortune to see her first, who seeing her young and handsome, could not but offer the Civility of the Cellar. <HI>Circe</HI> was very willing to accept his offer, the weather be∣ing hot, and having come a good way, she took off her Liquor, that the Butler began to conceive some hopes from the effect of the Drink. But they were scarce acquainted, when <HI>Hyleus</HI> came in from Fishing, and presently <HI>Circe</HI> deliver'd her message very diligently, and if I am not very much mistaken, 'twas just thus: Sir, my Lady, Madam <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> by me acquaints you she hath hitherto endeavour'd to find out the means of rewarding your Affection and constancy, which you may assure your self had been done before this, but that the old Gentlewoman her Mother hath such an aversion to any thing that she hath an inclination for, and seeing there is no way to quit scores with you but by running away, she doth this night intend to make her self happy with your good company, and for a token of her Love she hath sent you this Jewel, and desires you not to fail waiting for her with a Horse, at her Mother's door, where you may privately carry away your own <HI>Myrtilla.</HI></P>
<P>This unexpected News was extreamly surprising to <HI>Hyleus,</HI> who before was much fretted with the sport he but just now came from, for his ill suc∣cess in it. And is it so then, ye kind Deities (cry'd
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>he out) that my <HI>Myrtilla</HI> will thus freely put her self into my hands. I should never deserve any success in my Love, should I neglect this happiness. Nor am I one of those foolish foppish Lovers, who having lay'd siege to a Ladies Affections, then begin to throw of all respect, when she begins to throw off all her cruelty, and when she is coming to answer their expectations. Then turning to <HI>Circe,</HI> Assure the divine <HI>Myrtylla</HI> from me, I will not fail to expect her, and am only sorry that she order'd nothing more difficult, that she might see my Love in daring to compass it; take this (continu'd he giving her a Piece, and then kissing her) and carry this Kiss to thy Mistress, and assure her again I will not fail.</P>
<P>With this Answer departed <HI>Circe,</HI> who was got home before she was aware, who was extreamly ta∣keth with <HI>Hyleus,</HI> and thinking on the Token she had for <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> whom she now began to envy, and long as much for the forbidden fruit as her Mistress; coming to <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> she told her the good success of her Message, and how effectually it had wrought upon the Heart of <HI>Hyleus,</HI> who would not fail two hours after Sun-set; this done she enter'd on the not unpleasant Panegyrick of the expected Gentleman. The ill connection of it, as all other Chambermaids discourses, makes me I can't remember it, only this I am sure was in it, that he was a fine proper Man, handsom Leg'd, and she'd warrant as good a Woman's Man as any in the Shire. But the old Lady coming home made her unwillingly break off her Discourse.</P>
<P><HI>Hyleus</HI> by this time had got all things in readiness
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>for his Love-adventure, and setting out with two Servants he had towards the City, which was about three miles from his House, his great desire of the Prey made him there something of the soonest, which he had not been, but that <HI>Myrtilla</HI> and <HI>Circe</HI> were at difference; for her Mistress could not perswade her to stay behind, if she went, although she urg'd the unlikeliness of their Escape together, however she would not be contented till she had promis'd to send one of <HI>Hyleus</HI>'s Servants for her.</P>
<P>Now we are forc'd to a small digression, to make you acquainted that the Countrey and all it's Sports, with all the perswasions of his Friend <HI>Paneutus,</HI> could not make <HI>Cherestratus</HI> leave off thinking on his Mi∣stress, and it so happen'd that his Friend being en∣gag'd in some Business, our melancholy Lover being left to himself, who was now taking a turn in the Garden, began to recollect his former Affection, one while chiding himself for spending so long a time in a vain pursuit; another while angry with himself for leaving off now, when he was so far engag'd, and then a few musty Apothegms got in his Head, <HI>viz.</HI> Maids say No, and take it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he resolves to renew the Onset, for which he could not have met with a convenienter time, <HI>Paneutus</HI> being out of the way, for had he been at home, he could not have been brought to have parted with <HI>Cherestratus,</HI> whose company he took very much delight in: This being resolv'd on, he marched to the Stable, and charges the Groom immediately to make ready his Gelding, under pretence of breathing him that Evening,
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>and indeed so he did, for in half an hour and two minutes, he reach'd the door of his dearly belov'd <HI>Myrtilla.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hyleus</HI> you must know, thinking he had been too soon, had taken a turn down to view the Castle, thinking immediately to come back, and indeed it was not long e're he did, but however this is the critical minute, when out came <HI>Myrtilla</HI> in a riding Dress, making signs of dispatch to <HI>Cherestratus,</HI> who was staring on the Windows as he us'd to do, not dreaming what good luck was approaching him; Make hast, make hast my Dear (cryes the kind Lady) my Mother else will be here immediately. Our Gallant could scarce believe his Eyes or Ears, and thought certainly he was a dreaming, for he could never hope for such a happiness as to have his cruel Lady submit her self to him; but he now began to smell out the Plot, and without more adoe helpt the Lady up, who had not as yet discern'd the mi∣stake. Having got his rich Prize behind him, he thought it not safe to tarry there long, wherefore spurring on his free Beast, away he rides, and met with no obstacle, for the City gates were kept open for <HI>Hyleus,</HI> by the appointment of the Servants, who had brib'd the Watch-men (for you may assure your self in <HI>Comus</HI>'s City, they keep very good Hours, although the Citizens are commonly scan∣daliz'd for Revelling, or letting their Wives tarry up longer then themselves.)</P>
<P><HI>Hyleus</HI> was now return'd back to <HI>Myrtilla's</HI> Door, to which he was no sooner come, but he heard all
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>the House in an uproar; for it seems the old Lady had mist her Daughter, and began to ghess at the Business, for which she was schooling <HI>Circe</HI> most bit∣terly, who being in her riding Clothes, expecting <HI>Hyleus</HI>'s man, could not possibly frame any thing like an Excuse, at which her Mistress was so enrag'd, she began to seek for something to chastice the poor Maid. <HI>Circe</HI> therefore seeing her scarce avoidable Doom, runs out pulling the door after her, which hinder'd her Executioners pursuit. <HI>Hyleus</HI> who had been all this while in an Agony for his Lady, to think what would become of her, seeing <HI>Circe</HI> escaping out so boldly, and taking her for <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> lights strait off his Horse to help her up, which done, away he rides. He was no sooner got through the City Gate, but his Servants that accompany'd him thither, came out to congratulate his good fortune, he was so over∣joy'd with his Booty, he could scarce find time to thank them, making homewards with all the speed imaginable. Whither he was scarce come, when by his order three Maids met them strowing Flowers all the way home, while others there were busied in providing the Cake and Sack-Posset; at the Gate stood a proper Gentleman Usher to take down the Lady, Madam Chamber-maid; that done, off leaps <HI>Hyleus</HI> to salute her, and bid her welcome to her Own.</P>
<P>And now at last it was that the miserable man perceiv'd his Errour, but he was wonderfully sur∣priz'd to see <HI>Circe,</HI> where he expected <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> he began now to consider how improbable it was, that
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>she should give her self up to him so easily, and now concludes it was a Plot of <HI>Circe's,</HI> to whom he ad∣dresses himself to be clear'd of the doubt. And is it thus, base Slut, thou hast abus'd me, and thy Mistress? was it for your embraces I have taken all this pains and care? were the numerous Pages about Town, that us'd to accompany their Masters to visit my dear <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> grown so scarce, that I must be made a Pro∣perty? I wonder thy impudence could ever harbour such a thought, so prejudicious to thy Lady, as to think I was reserv'd for thy tooth; how cam'st thou by this Jewel, which I am confident belong'd once to <HI>Myrtilla?</HI> For none sure would buy thy favour at the vast expence of so rich a Diamond? He would have gone on in his tedious Harangue, but being al∣ways kind hearted to Females, he began to consider how unmanly it was to quarrel with a Woman, and for a fault Love had made her commit. However, his passion proceeded so far that he call'd her Whore: Poor <HI>Circe</HI> who all this while stood shivering for fear (though it seem'd to her a pleasant pain, being in the company of her sweet <HI>Hyleus</HI>) was something mov'd at the last word, which made a deeper im∣pression on her mind, then all had past before (for though I will not swear for her, yet I think she was honest) she makes him this Answer. My kindness in helping young Gentlemen in Addresses to my Lady, could never deserve that name. No, no, Sir, you have here no Whore, nor one that had any designs upon you, but what were innocent and devoted to the Service of my young Mistress. I will not indeed so far
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>bely my Conscience, as to deny I lov'd you; but I was so far from promoting my love, that I quite despair'd of it; and therefore resolv'd to be happy in the next degree, namely, in mediating with you for my Mi∣stress. The desire of following her hath thus be∣tray'd me to your censure. And is <HI>Myrtilla</HI> gone before, then? said <HI>Hyleus;</HI> Yes Sir, answered <HI>Circe,</HI> she is, and had not your Passion transported you, you might e're this have been in a Capacity of reco∣vering my Lady, who cannot be gone far.</P>
<P><HI>Circe's</HI> Answer you'l say was very excusable, and indeed <HI>Hyleus</HI> could not but approve of it, although anger for his ravish'd Mistress would not let him at present acknowledge it. For he immediately com∣manded his Horses to be brought out of the Stable again, but hold, I think they were not yet put in, and with his other Fellow Travellers like a Knight Errant, resolves to go to rescue the Lady, leaving poor <HI>Circe</HI> again to the mercy of the Butler, who was now resolv'd to try the utmost strength of his strong Beer Philter on the weak Virgin. But she, contrary to his expectation, seem'd more coy, as having more hopes then ever of marrying <HI>Hyleus,</HI> in case her Mistress could not be found out. But we must be found as uncivil as <HI>Hyleus,</HI> and leave her to the But∣lers managing, and mad he to his Progress, and re∣turn to <HI>Cherestratus:</HI></P>
<P>Who by this being ten miles out of Town, was impatient to see and salute his sweet Prey, whose Maiden-modesty not suffering her to speak first, very much wonder'd at her silent Lover. They were
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>scarce gone a quarter of a mile further; but the transparent Rays of the bright Queen of Night (a rare expression for Moon shine this same) made discovery of a delicate pleasant Meadow, which lay just by the Road-side. <HI>Cherestratus</HI> could not for his life pass by this opportunity, he light and gently taking <HI>Myrtilla</HI> off the Horse, began the amorous Prologue with a Kiss. That done, Madam, said he, how happy have you made the late miserable <HI>Chere∣stratus!</HI> At the name of <HI>Cherestratus, Myrtilla</HI> started, and looking upon him seriously, knew him to be the person nam'd. The poor Lady was so extreamly troubled at this unexpected Accident, that she swoun∣ed away in <HI>Cherestratus</HI>'s Arms, and truly me thinks it was ominous, for ever since that night the Lady was troubled with Qualms. But I fear I shall be cen∣sur'd for playing thus with a Gentlewomans mis∣fortunes; all I have to excuse it is, that knowing the the fifth Act of the Play and how they came off, it is pardonable to be merry, and laugh before as she did after sufficiently.</P>
<P><HI>Cherestratus</HI> you may imagine was in a sweet kind of taking to think that he had lost his Mistress before he had her (which was true enough, if you can make it out) besides a Constable and a grave igno∣rant Jury came in his head, for some might think he had kill'd her, besides the plaguy fear of being wrote against, like <HI>Philaster</HI> for being the death of his pretty Miss. All this consider'd, the poor man was extreamly put to his shifts, what to do. And though men say our wits are best in cases of necessity,
<PB N="19" REF="15"/>he at present could not think of a better Remedy, then <HI>Hudibras</HI>'s, so that he was forc'd to give her a gentle twinge oth' Nose, for Water in that place there was none, nor any thing else that might conduce to the recovering of a Lady out of that sad condition. <HI>Myrtilla</HI> by this was something come again to her self, and gave <HI>Cherestratus</HI> some small hopes of her, to whom in a lamentable tone she said. By what Magick, Villian, hast thou depriv'd me of the com∣pany of my dear <HI>Hyleus?</HI> who were he but present, would teach you better manners, then to lie Eves∣dropping thus, to betray the secrets of miserable Lovers. But alas, why blame I you? It was my own rashness, for which I am justly punish'd, since I could not distinguish betwixt the Worthy <HI>Hyleus</HI> and the base <HI>Cherestratus.</HI> Our Gallant, that thought himself well enough to pass, as never having a Rupture, or any thing else that might reduce him to the using the Wedding Ring the wrong way, in case Art had conquer'd Nature, could not endure to hear <HI>Myrtilla</HI> preferr <HI>Hyleus</HI> so much before him, and was going to vindicate himself when thus she continued. O my unhappy Fate! have I for this prov'd disobedient, and left my old Mother? to fall into the hands of him I so much hated, who is in pretence only a Lover? if it be not so as I say, prove your Affection, and re∣deem your fault by killing the miserable <HI>Myrtilla.</HI> Faintly he thought she spoke, for all the while— stay, I think there was no smile in the case; however <HI>Cherestratus</HI> who came <HI>communi Animantium appetitu,</HI> did not care to satisfie his Lady in that point, and had
<PB N="20" REF="16"/>rather get the King a Souldier, then lose him a Sub∣ject, for Ladies do good Service. No, Madam, said he, that were to injure you, and rob my self of the greatest happiness in the world. Your misfortunes are not such, as to make you boldly wish for Death, that Bug-Bear to all Ladies. 'Tis time enough for it yet, you have no reason to think on't, being in the hands of a Person, of whose incivility you never yet had any proof. I cannot imagine you are really angry, when if you are pleas'd to remember I took you up in a ready Dress for the March, as if you as well as Heaven were willing to make me happy. For doubtless, Madam, it was not by meer chance, I left my Friend in the Countrey at so unseasonable time of Night to come and visit your door, where unlookt for, my good Genious had prepar'd me a sight of my divine <HI>Myrtilla.</HI> No, no, the Powers above, whose will we ought not to resist, ordain'd this, to see how happy they could make a mortal Man by the pre∣sence of a person so nigh their Divinities, as your in∣comparable self. This done, he put his Handkerchief to his Eyes, and us'd such comforting expressions to the Lady, that they dissipated her clouds of Sorrows. Her Eyes shot such lustre, that the Moon with all the noise of Brass Pots and Kettles that could be rung out fear'd an Eclipse. To be short, she seem'd so well satisfy'd, that <HI>Cherestratus</HI> tying his Horse to a Tree, did not much offend her, in desiring her to repose her self on a neighbouring Bank. They were no sooner sat down, but our Gallant began before his Mistress to admire the works of Nature in that pleasant place,
<PB N="21" REF="16"/>in whose commendations he insisted so far, that soon after he forc'd her to yield to some Arguments he brought. He show'd her all the pretty Sceletons, the fair Flowers I mean, that once were Bodies of young Men and Ladies, and turn'd into that fading condition for denying their Admirers some small Cur∣tesie or other. He might have gone on longer, for seriously the place was so pleasant that it is impossible to imagine any thing beyond it in natural Bravery. <HI>Adonis</HI>'s Garden, and whatever Antiquity hath made famous for Pleasures, could not reach it. I would have strove for a little Poetry, but that at present I I am not in the Humour, but if I make a modern Poet of ours describe it better then perhaps I should have done, I suppose 'tis all one.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>NAture is wanton here, and the high way</HI></L>
<L><HI>Seem'd to be private, though it open lay,</HI></L>
<L><HI>As if some swelling Lawyer for his health,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or frantick Ʋsurer to tame his wealth,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Had chosen out ten miles — to try</HI></L>
<L><HI>Two great effects of Art and Industry.</HI></L>
<L><HI>The ground they trod, was Meadow fertile land,</HI></L>
<L><HI>New trim'd and levell'd by the Mowers hand,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Above it grew a Rock, rude, steep and high,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which claims a kind of Reverence from the Eye,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Betwixt 'em both there glides a lovely stream</HI></L>
<L><HI>Not loud but swift. Meander was a Theam</HI></L>
<L><HI>Crooked and rough, but had the Poets seen</HI></L>
<L><HI>Strait and even (for I have forgot the name) it had immortal been,</HI></L>
<PB N="22" REF="17"/>
<L><HI>This side the open Plain admits the Sun,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To half the River then did Silver run:</HI></L>
<L><HI>The other half ran clouds, where the curl'd Wood</HI></L>
<L><HI>With his exalted head threatned the flood,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>They had not been in this delightful Scene long, but <HI>Cherestratus</HI> found his Lady's mind to sympathize with the pleasantness of the place, which so reviv'd on a sudden her drooping Spirits, that she seem'd so brisk, airy and gay, as gave our Gallant good hopes that the thoughts of <HI>Hyleus</HI> were remov'd, and that she had no small Affection for him, who was now mu∣sing how to compass the great design, for the obtain∣ing which he thought nothing more efficacious, then the disparagement of <HI>Hyleus,</HI> his Rival. Madam, cries he, you cannot now but be satisfied how noble all my actions have been to you, far beyond <HI>Hyleus</HI>'s, by whose unpardonable neglect I have now the hap∣piness of seeing my dear <HI>Myrtilla.</HI> Lovers, Lady, are seldome slow when invited by their Mistresses, which makes me confident <HI>Hyleus</HI> had only an intent to abuse and disgrace you, who had not the hours above sent me to that happy Station, your door, had been expos'd to the censure of the Neighbours, besides the Anger you might have incurr'd from the old Gentlewoman your Mother. Ungrateful man, that could disesteem so great an obligation!</P>
<P>These words so wrought upon her, that she became more obliging than before, so that she very com∣plaisantly render'd thanks to her Lover for his true Affection, and vow'd she would never have an
<PB N="23" REF="17"/>esteem for his Rival, which was all the recompence she could make him. No, Madam, (reply'd <HI>Chere∣stratus</HI>) if I have deserv'd any thing of you, you may soon think of a better way of rewarding your Lover; who for all those favours he saw you daily heap on the unworthy <HI>Hyleus,</HI> could not diminish his Affections to you, which must now be rewarded, or he will sacrifice his miserable life before you. Then taking out a true <HI>Bilbo</HI> blade, that had never kill'd a man yet, and therefore wanted seasoning, he set it to his Breast, and desir'd his Sentence. The tender-hearted Lady that but just now desir'd to die her self could not endure to see her Lover fall a Victim at her feet, and resolv'd to withstand man∣slaughter, said. Hold, Sir, your case is not so desperate, nor I hope your love for me so little, as to kill him I esteem, thy self I mean, my dear <HI>Cherestratus.</HI> And assure your self, that you or no man, shall be the Per∣son that shall make me happy. Our young Gentle∣man could not have desir'd a more satisfactory Answer from his Lady, to whom (putting up his naked tool) he reply'd. Then, Madam, assure your self, you have bestow'd your favours on one that will study to deserve them, while the careless <HI>Hyleus</HI> shall die with envy at my good fortune: After the Peace thus con∣cluded between both parties, there pass'd many amo∣rous Dialogues, all which were begun and ended with a sweet Kiss.</P>
<P><HI>Myrtilla</HI> you must understand, whether entic'd by his pretty discourse, or mov'd with an equal desire, seem'd extraordinary loving, so that <HI>Cherestratus</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="18"/>could not but put forward, had he been less modest then he was. At my first view I was extreamly amaz'd, for, but that I had seen the Moon with all her twinkling Attendance, I should have sworn I saw the Lady <HI>Aurora</HI> in one of her richest Vermilion Sutes. For it seems something that <HI>Cherestratus</HI> had said in her Ear, had dy'd her Cheeks with a Rosie blush. I expected now she should have rattled him soundly, but it seems she was not so angry as I took her for: They continued their Discourse for some time, which though I could not hear; I soon per∣ceiv'd it was no Treason they spoke; for soon after I saw <HI>Myrtilla</HI> with small reluctancy receive a Green Gown from her lusty Lover, who was now prepa∣ring to make his Lady amends to the utmost of his power for her former Favours. We will leave 'em in mutual Embraces, and instead of an <HI>Epithalamium</HI> (for I am loth to be idle) make an Apology for their not staying the Parson's leisure. To which these grave Reasons induce them.</P>
<P>First, Here the Bride-groom is sure next morning to have all his Ribbons upon his Breeches.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Bride, or the Woman lay with, will not be at a loss to find her Stockings, which at Ceremonious Weddings are thrown over her Head, nor will her Pins be lost to dress her with.</P>
<P>Thirdly, While they lie on the Grass, they need not fear cutting the Bed-cords, or sowing the Sheets together.</P>
<P>Fourthly, There can be no Bell under their Bed, unless a natural Blew-Bell.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="18"/>
<P>Fifthly, The Lady need not be put to the blush the next morning by a company of her Chronies with asking her how she does, and how she likes it.</P>
<P>Sixthly and lastly, No troublesome crowd of Fidlers betimes in the morning, to spoil better sport with their miserable scraping. For these and some other Reasons, our Lovers may deserve your pardon, which I question not but you will give them without peti∣tioning for.</P>
<P><HI>Cherestratus</HI> now began to fail in his vigour, and was sounding a Retreat in a whole Volly of Kisses, which she return'd very willingly, as being now con∣scious of the Obligation she had to him. And then they setled themselves for a gentle Repose, which they did in so sweet a posture, she infolding his Neck in her delicate Arms, that they seem'd like <HI>Cynthia</HI> and her belov'd <HI>Endymion,</HI> whose soft Embraces she so oft courted. They had not lain long thus, but a sweet Sleep seiz'd them both, in which they dream'd over again what they had just now been the real partakers of. Where we will leave them to their natural Rest, and return to <HI>Hyleus</HI> and his three Companions, who just now unfortunately arriv'd at this Scene of Love, whither they were no sooner arriv'd, but <HI>Hyleus</HI> spy'd out the Pair of Lovers in that loving Condition, that I describ'd them in.</P>
<P><HI>Hyleus</HI> was enrag'd to see his <HI>Myrtilla</HI> as it were with her own Consent given up to another. He immediately draws his Rapier, and swears most damnably that he will be the death of <HI>Cherestratus,</HI> as in effect he had, but that those who accompany'd
<PB N="26" REF="19"/>him, having a kindness for his happy Rival, per∣swaded him to desist from his purpose, at least they told him he ought to stay till he wak'd, for then he might force him nobly either to resign up his Life, or his Mistress, supposing he had forc'd her against her Will (as the loving posture they were in, was proof enough to the contrary) for otherwise, it was not worth the while. Well, with much adoe, <HI>Hyleus</HI> was at last perswaded to stay till he wak'd, but then he swore to be reveng'd on him.</P>
<P>Hereupon for this purpose lighting off their Hor∣ses, they all sat down by our sleeping Lovers; It had been you'l say, a great temptation to his fellow Travellers to lie by so handsome a Lady, but be∣ing weary with accompanying their Master in his wilde pursuit, they thus seem'd with him rather to have a desire to sleep, than any thing else; they strove indeed a great while against the drowsie Distemper, but <HI>Morpheus</HI> at last arrested them, in the King's name, and charg'd them to keep the Peace, which they had broken with their loud Jangling.</P>
<P>They had not been long under the Leaden Scep∣ter'd Gentieman's hands, but the two Lovers a∣wak'd very much troubled to see any Company there, but much more when they knew them to be <HI>Hyleus</HI> and his men. <HI>Cherestratus</HI> bid his <HI>Myrtilla</HI> not be affraid, but prepare for her Journey, by which he doubted not, but they should escape the Enemy, which <HI>Myrtilla</HI> as much now endeavour'd to avoid,
<PB N="27" REF="19"/>as not long before she coveted the Sight of <HI>Hyleus. Cherestratus</HI> that had before learn'd of <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> that <HI>Hyleus</HI> had receiv'd a rich Diamond of her, which was to be worn in his Hat, was unwilling to leave that Token of his Ladies former Affection behind him, wherefore he advanc'd towards <HI>Hyleus,</HI> and did without any difficulty find out the Jewel by the ex∣tream lustre of it. Having got this, he and <HI>Myrtilla</HI> march with full speed together towards his Friend's House, with whom he had lodg'd being invited, the honest trusty Soul <HI>Paneutus.</HI></P>
<P>They had not been long gone, but <HI>Hyleus</HI> and his men awake, and find the Pair of Lovers gone, to the satisfaction of all but <HI>Hyleus,</HI> who was so much troubled at their escape, that they had much adoe to keep him from laying violent hands on himself, but his rage was very much encreas'd when he saw the Jewel was gone too, and now he resolves to pursue <HI>Cherestratus,</HI> not as a Rival only, but as a profest Enemy. The Servants did all they could to pacifie their furious Master, telling him he ought not to be so incens'd against <HI>Cherestratus,</HI> since he had done nothing but what a Lover in the like case would have done, and that doubtless it was not his fault, but <HI>Myrtilla</HI> either by her free consent, or the treachery of <HI>Circe,</HI> that lov'd him her self, had deliver'd her up to him. And that since 'twas so, he ought not to despise the innocent flames of pretty <HI>Circe,</HI> who excepting her Birth, seem'd altogether as worthy his Bed, as the scornful, faithless <HI>Myr∣tilla.</HI> What though she sent that Diamond, yet
<PB N="28" REF="20"/><HI>Circe</HI> brought it, by whom he might reckon it given too, seeing there was no Remedy left, and there appear'd not the least hopes of overtaking the happy couple.</P>
<P><HI>Hyleus</HI>'s passion was now pretty well over, when he took Horse for Home, intending to follow his Servants Counsel, and make poor <HI>Circe</HI> happy, who all this while was crying, and deploring her condi∣tion. As soon as he came in, he call'd for her, and with a Kiss told her, his Intention was to marry her that Night, telling her the mad Adventures of his rash Journey. <HI>Circe</HI> you may easily imagine, was very well pleas'd to hear her Mistress had sped so well, and that she was now to enjoy her belov'd <HI>Hyleus. Hyleus</HI> immediately sent for the man in Black, and gave order for making ready that very Night for the Wedding, which was done with all speed, and they two huddled to Bed together, for better for worse, where I suppose they had as much satisfaction of one another, as <HI>Cherestratus</HI> and <HI>Myr∣tilla</HI> did before, besides the advantage they had of a softer Bed.</P>
<P>The next day early, <HI>Hyleus</HI> sent to bespeak the Wedding Dinner five miles off, where also <HI>Chere∣stratus</HI> with his Lady were that day to be merry together; and as good luck would have it, they were in the next Room to one another, though neither Company knew of it, till about Dinner time. <HI>Myrtilla</HI> hearing <HI>Hyleus</HI>'s Voice in the next Room, swouned, <HI>Cherestratus</HI> and all his Company
<PB N="29" REF="20"/>wonder'd at the suddeness of her sickness, and su∣spected there was something in it more then ordi∣nary; and as soon as she came to her self again, she told them the Reason, <HI>viz.</HI> That she heard <HI>Hyleus,</HI> and fear'd lest he should know of <HI>Chere∣stratus,</HI> and there might some mischief be done. They cheer'd her up, and told her there was no fear of any such thing, especially in that place. While they were comforting <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> a Gentle∣man that was equally a Friend to both of them, ran to tell <HI>Hyleus,</HI> having first engag'd him to be civil, since things could not be alter'd. <HI>Hyleus</HI> was at first surprized, but then one glance of <HI>Circe's</HI> dispell'd his anger, and he was resolv'd to joyn Companies, which he presently did, to the satis∣faction of both Parties. Where I'le leave them drinking their Ladies Healths, besides some odd Brushers to the little Country Gentleman, or <HI>Myr∣tilla's Hans en Kelder.</HI></P>
