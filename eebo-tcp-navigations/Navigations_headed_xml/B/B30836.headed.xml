Having the great encouragement of your Lordships Patronage, to assist the weakness of my Endeavours; the which since they are in my own way, at least as an observer and well wish∣er to health and life; it may seem not improper for me, to remark in a new Colony, as <HI>Jamaica</HI> is, the Conducers thereto, and to transfer such to a further cultivation; that the English or others may not miss of their ends in transporting them∣selves thither, nor his Majesty of his Subjects by too immature deaths. My Lord, the sincerity

<HEAD>THE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<LABEL><HI>CHAP. I. Of the Air of</HI> Jamaica,</LABEL>
<ITEM>OF the Ordinary Temperature of the Air between the Tropicks, and whence. Of the Winds which in <HI>Jamaica</HI> for the most part regular, and observe stated times. Of the several sorts of Breezes, and their different effects. The Sea Breezes reign in the day and are healthful, the Land at night and dis∣pose to Diseases. A fuller description of the Breezes and of the Norths, whence they proceed and how the Island of <HI>Jamaica</HI> is influenced by them, and an e∣numeration of the Distempers frequently introduced by them, and the ordinary Land Breezes. That these winds are dangerous to ancient Inhabitants, less hurtful to new comers from <HI>Europe,</HI> especially
<PB REF="5"/>from <HI>England</HI> and other more Northerly parts and why. Why those Winds also hurtful unto such as transplant themselves for <HI>Barbadoes, Mevis, Mon∣teral,</HI> and others of the <HI>Carib</HI> Islands. Of the con∣sistence of the Air of <HI>Jamaica.</HI> Proved that it is thick and gross notwithstanding the excessive heat, but that the great inconveniences which would other∣wise thereupon ensue, prevented by its constant agita∣tion with winds. That the Air doth also notwith∣standing the predominancy of the heat abound with moisture, as also with a volatile nitrous Salt, prov∣ed from the speedy rusting of Steel and Iron, and the penetrancy and wonderful fructifyiag quality of their rains and dews: hereby putrefaction hindred, hence is it that the heat is so little troublesome, and that the heat doth not cause such thirst as the same would in <HI>Europe:</HI> from this also proceeds their be∣ing more lax in their Bowels. A Digression con∣cerning the Nature of Nitre and the manner of its generation or production, that from its copiousness Ja∣maicans not ordinarily subject to the Scorbute, Plague, or even continued Fevers; most Fevers being in∣termitting, the Cause whereof assigned.</ITEM>
<LABEL><HI>Chap. II. Of the Place.</HI> </LABEL>
<ITEM>Its Longitude, Position in reference to Neighbouring Countries. Its form and figure from whence not sub∣ject to Hurrieanes. <HI>Jamaica</HI> divisible chiefly into plain and mountainous Country; their different na∣ture and temperature, and whence it comes to pass that it is hazardous without due care and provision
<PB REF="5"/>to pass suddainly from one to the other. A descrip∣tion of <HI>Cagway</HI> or <HI>Port Royal</HI> the chief harbour and habitation of the Island. Its Scituation, the Ad∣vantages and Inconveniences thereof in reference chiefly unto health and sickness. <HI>Ligany</HI> a most beau∣tiful Territory. River <HI>de Covre;</HI> The Town or City of St. <HI>Jago de la viega.</HI> The Savanna's be∣tween St. <HI>Jago</HI> and the Mountains. An account of the Sugar works and several caveats, about the accom∣modation of both Whites and Blacks, in order to the preventing Distempers whereunto otherwise obnoxi∣ous. An account of the Distempers result from the over-copious drinking of Rum and other spirituous liquors. Two surprising rarities, one of a Tree whose bark shines most vividly in the dark, especially in rainy weather, which lustre continues many hours after its separation from the Wood. The other of an animated seed endued with a power of self motion, which it enjoys many days, concerning which, many very strange circumstances related, which were be∣held by divers witnesses, ready to attest the seemingly otherwise incredible Report. A very pleasant descri∣ption of the journey over or through the Mountains, from tho South to the North side of the Island. A description of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in the Vale, surrounded with mountains and almost continually skreened with Fogs, yet populous and healthful. The descent from the mountain to the North side of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the dif∣ferent temperature of the Air from that of the South, different seasons as to winds and rains, and the con∣sequents thereof. That this side is more proper for
<PB REF="6"/>Plantations of Cacaa. The description of a Cacaa walk, where first of the Plantane which always planted by it, then of the Cacaa it self, Piemente, Winters bark, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Several other Commodities which this side of the Island is capable of producing. The Au∣thor promises a large natural History of the Island.</ITEM>
<LABEL><HI>Chap. III.</HI> Of the Water of <HI>Jamaica.</HI></LABEL>
<ITEM>Of Water in General. The Water of the River <HI>de Co∣vre</HI> which runs by St. <HI>Jago,</HI> wholesome at some times of the year and unhealthful at others, that latter is chiefly during the Rains, when increased by tor∣rents from the mountains impregnated with mineral Particles. The Spaniards caution in its use and cure of it, which not sufficiently regarded or imitated by the English, whence what inconveniences have en∣sued. Why the water of this River is better near <HI>Port Royal</HI> than at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and near the moun∣tains. Advice concerning its use and more perfect Cure. An account of a better water near the <HI>Port.</HI> Danger in the frequent use of Well water especially at <HI>Ligany</HI> Why Rain and Pond water generally more wholesome. <HI>Jamaica</HI> abounds with Rivers and Springs, especially in its more mountainous parts. Why these afford most wholesome Drink nearest their head, also more pure, clear and cooling. A digression why in most Countries Mountainers more robust and healthful than those which inhabit the Vales. Of a Vegetable which cut, affords copiously a healthful li∣quor. Of the Coco Nut Tree and its various uses.</ITEM>
<PB REF="6"/>
<LABEL><HI>Chap. IV.</HI> Of the Customs and manners of Living. </LABEL>
<ITEM>That we must necessarily change our way of living and accommodate it unto the Climate wherein we reside. That the ordinary English way of living is no ways suitable in most Southern Countries. Where we must eat more sparingly and frequently. A suitable Regu∣lar Diet recommended and particularized. Of Wine, that no sort so proper for the Jamaicans, as that brought from the <HI>Madera.</HI> Its good Qualities, and how wonderfully in all respects appropriated unto <HI>Ja∣maica.</HI> The noxiousness of most of the Wines brought from <HI>Europe.</HI> How the Jamaican should order him∣self in the night, whence it comes to pass that four Males dye to one of the other Sex, regard being had also to the disproportion in number. Of Chocolate, its commendation being duely taken, it is the Manna of the <HI>West Indies.</HI> Advice how to make and take it. The Conveniencies thereof, and whence so agreeable unto the Inhabitants of Southern Countries. Of Fruits, which may with safety and benefit be eaten, when and how. Of Flesh, Fish especially, the Sea Tortoise or Tur∣tle, which is by the Author largely commended, divers ways of preparing it for food specified, divers Rea∣sons and Conjectures why it must necessarily be won∣derfully Nutritive, Restaurative, and conduce to pro∣long life. Where several remarkable observations a∣bout Turtles. Of the Manaty or Sea Cow. The Jew Fish their description and use, as also of divers other species of edible Fishes there enumerated. That as in
<PB REF="7"/><HI>Jamaica</HI> no venemous Creatures; so neither in Ri∣vers or Neighbouring Sea any poysonous Fish which infest most that dwell on the Continent, <HI>Bahama</HI> and other Islands of the <HI>West Indies.</HI> Divers sorts of Fowls enumerated, which so wholesome, that no dan∣ger from any ill quality but satiety.</ITEM>
<LABEL><HI>Chap. V.</HI> Of the Intemperatures and Diseases in general, and Fluxes in particular. </LABEL>
<ITEM>That <HI>Jamaica</HI> produces few Diseases in comparison of Northern Countries. Seldom Small Pox unless brought with the Negroes from <HI>Africa.</HI> No Scurvy or Depopulative Plague, Consumptions rare and ne∣ver so tedious as in <HI>England.</HI> Venereal Effects their symptomes all lessened, their cure easie. The Stone a great Stranger, women liable to few Diseases on the account of their Sex, and Childbirth easie to admi∣ration. The Diseases of <HI>Jamaica</HI> few and simple. The first which usually surprizes new comers, the <HI>Diar∣rhoea</HI> or Flux, which unless some gross irregularity precede, friendly; caused ordinarily by change of Drinks and Diet. Its usual symptomes and Cure. If not timely regarded or duely managed, degenerates into a bloody Flux. Its Causes, Effect, and Cure. Of the white Flux, its Remedy.</ITEM>
<LABEL><HI>Chap. VI.</HI> Of the Fevers in <HI>Jamaica.</HI> </LABEL>
<ITEM>An Explication of the Name and Nature of Fevers at large, their several causes and various effects. That there's no malignity originally in Fevers at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> though sometimes superadded by the management of
<PB REF="7"/>the attendant or Patient for want of due evacuation or exasperating hot remedies. The most general and proper Remedies for Fevers in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> bleeding and vomiting. Of the Pestilential Fever brought to <HI>Jamai∣ca,</HI> after the return from the expedition from <HI>Pana∣ma.</HI> Whence spots appear in some after Death, and the Faintings, cold Sweats, <HI>Deliriums, &amp;c.</HI> in some per∣sons, yet without just suspicion of malignity: These as before from neglect or ignorance, all which by due method and remedies easily obviated. Whence it is that our Fevers usually intermittent, of which there are divers sorts, all which duely manag'd prove simple Tertians, but if interrupted continued. The use of Cor∣dials dangerous, for which divers reasons assigned. The most successful and natural Cure is to begin with Emeticks, and then to proceed with Sudorificks, of which latter sort <HI>China</HI> Root plentifully growing in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> is commended and by long and frequent ex∣perience approved. The Quantity and seasons of ex∣hibiting, and several ways of preparing it, which effe∣ctual not only in Tertians but even Quartans. This Plant recommended to the use of Europeans.</ITEM>
<LABEL><HI>Chap. VII.</HI> Of the Dropsie called the Country Disease.</LABEL>
<ITEM>A general Description of the Dropsie and its several kinds. Servants and careless or neglected persons most liable to this Distemper. They are usually after Fluxes Fevers and other Diseases, where Nature weak and Transpiration lessened and interrupted; as appears in its Cure by Ʋnction. A specifick Remedy for this
<PB REF="8"/>Disease afforded by <HI>Jamaica.</HI> Its description called the Dumb Cane, whosoever toucheth it with his tongue becoming dumb some hours after. That 'tis no poyson and might therefore probably be taken inwardly, but the Author applies it only externally. Its preparation and how to be used, its odd effects, where occasionally of the like evacuation caused by another plant, very successfully applied in the Pleurisie. A Philosophical account of its operations. Cure by baths recommended the decoction made with the Dumb Cane, as also with Savanna Weed which is a sort of Spikenard.</ITEM>
<LABEL><HI>Chap. VIII.</HI> Of Worms. </LABEL>
<ITEM>Whence Worms so frequent in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and that the persons chiefly afflicted therewith, are children, wo∣men and weakly infirm. Their Symptomes. Occasion∣ed partly by the Air, partly by the Water and Diet, the former being too plentifully impregnated with the Eggs or seminal Principles of Insects: And Bread not being over plentiful the meaner sort feed on Po∣tato's and other Roots, which are here accounted ae∣quivalent to Bread. The proper Remedies against Worms are almost all bitter things, especially Reme∣dies irradiated with Mercury. The Cure somewhat diversified by the parts in which the Worms reside, how to make discovery thereof. Jamaican Aloes or Sempervive variously prepared a specifical Remedy against Worms: As also irradiations of Mercury communicated to convenient Vehicles; and succeed∣ed by gentle Purges. That safe, and nothing of the bo∣dy of Mercury mixed therewith. A Physical account and Demonstration thereof.</ITEM>
<PB REF="8"/>
<LABEL><HI>Chap. IX.</HI> Of Venereal Affects. </LABEL>
<ITEM>How first known to <HI>Europe.</HI> Some odd Conjectures con∣cerning its Original at large. The Yaws its description. Cured with ease and certainty in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> by a Me∣thodical use of Vomits, Purging and Bleeding, together with an easie Parable Remedy for external Sores at large described and vindicated. In this Chapter our Author seems to describe an Endemial Disease pro∣per to the <HI>West Indies,</HI> as the Root of the Pox, which latter he accounts an European Disease grafted on an Indian, and ascribes unto them different Cures. The Authors Conjecture that many of the Symptomes in the Yaws and Pox, may proceed from minute Ani∣mals, confirmed by divers Reasons and Observations. That the Air of <HI>Jamaica</HI> conduces much to the easie and speedy Cure of the Distemper, by Reason of its nitrous Quality. The Cure of the Pox as successfully practised in <HI>Jamaica</HI> by a plain methodical Course, in which he usually employs a Balsamical Juice, whose use first discovered by wild Boars, its excellent quali∣ties and signal effects.</ITEM>
<LABEL><HI>Chap. X.</HI> Of the Dry Belly Ach. </LABEL>
<ITEM>A dreadful Distemper, how occasioned. The Parts affect∣ed, its terrible and affrightful Symptomes. Divers Arguments to prove it proceeds from cold and hin∣drance of perspiration, together with a mineral Steam which he shews capable of producing such like Distem∣pers. That it often proves a Chronical Disease ending in an Atrophy. In the <HI>East Indies</HI> and Neighbouring
<PB REF="9"/>Countries of the same temperature not so obnoxious to this Disease, which ascribed to their frequent bath∣ing: By our Author recommended as a sure preven∣tion of this formidable Malady. A specifical Remedy for this Distemper common to <HI>Jamaica</HI> and most part of the <HI>West Indies,</HI> to be accompanied and succeed∣ed by the external Ʋse and Application of the foremen∣tioned Balsamick Juice or Gumm.</ITEM>
<LABEL>The Conclusion.</LABEL>
<ITEM>A general Method for the prevention and moderating most of the forementioned Distempers, which consists in the frequent use of suitable Baths. The Authors ad∣vice how to prepare and order themselves therein. The other Remedy earnestly recommended unto the Wealthy is Ambergriese. The Authors Opinion concer∣ning its Production, Vertues, and Ʋse. That it's no a∣nimal or mineral bituminous Substance, but a vegeta∣ble Juice coagulated by the salt Water. Divers Ar∣guments to confute the commonly received Opinions, and establish his own.</ITEM>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE OF THE State of Health IN THE ISLAND OF JAMAICA, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT being my business, while in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to consider the Health and attend the Diseases of the place, it was necessary to commit what occurred in that af∣fair to a more faithful Register than my memory: to the which, that I might better effect my end, I was forced often to recur, and thereby to amend what too easily im∣posed
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>it self on my credence, or else what I was more confirmed in, became the better establishment of my practice.</P>
<P>The first Generals, whereto I referred my self, were the Topicks of <HI>Hippocrates, viz.</HI> the Air, the Place, and the Waters, next the Cu∣stoms and manners of living: and lastly the consequents of the former, <HI>viz.</HI> the intempe∣ratures and Diseases either peculiar to the Tropicks or most usually found thereabouts all which may not serve barely for specu∣lation but the use and benefits of the Inhabi∣tants, either for their timely preventing or else curing their incident Maladies. Not as if <HI>Jamaica</HI> were obnoxious to more Di∣seases, and such more frightful then are else∣where to be found, for the sequell will de∣monstrate the contrary, but least such as are there, prove more fatal for want of be∣ing remarked: and forasmuch as no one yet hath done that charitable office to his neigh∣bour, I cannot without rebuke of my con∣science refuse to become a Samaritan, and by thereto make what reasonable provision I may for the comfort and recovery of the af∣flicted: for it doth not a little uneasily touch humanity to see the burthens of nature aggravated by ignorance of remedy, and want of sutable assistances. Neither
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>is it a little confusion to be able to do so lit∣tle in so desirable a work; however a single Talent may not be napkined without guilt, and that not to be expiated without a double diligence. It's true a little labour is more then doubly troublesome in a hot Country, where the most sooner seek the shade, though it be but of an Ass, rather than undergo the heat of the day; where∣fore to start any thing that may exercise in a lazy country, hath this in it of praise, that it's against the grain, and manifests somewhat of self-denial, at least the va∣nity of ostentation or humor of scribling can have small pretences here, where there is so little of gaity offered at. And in a place where Bookishness is not reasonably to be expect∣ed, it may suffice, if relation of matter of fact imploy the more sagacious in profita∣ble deductions, or that the present truths afford relief to any one afflicted. For it must needs be irksome to have the pleasures of a summer country, such as <HI>Jamaica</HI> is, interrupted by indispositions and want of list to enjoy what's so plentifully offered. It's pity a rational Creature should surfeit of di∣licacy, and not moderate his inclinations out of good husbandry to enjoy it the longer. but since appetite is apt to over-rule our rea∣sons,
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>and the desire of good tempts to the nearest confines of evil, by how much the more desirable the place and clime is, by so much the more need of circumspection: to the which if I might happily awaken my Country-men, I may prevent surprisals, which of all is the greatest evil the English usually lay open to, through too hardy a cou∣rage rather then remiss supineness: they being too prone to slight their lives rather than be curious in their preservation; a tem∣per happy and agreeable enough to the northern Climes, but unsutable to the torrid Zone, where through the great activity of Nature most sudden changes are effected, a sound health oft precipitated into Distem∣per, and such Distempers posting to the Grave, ere the sluggish observer be awake∣ned to prevention. To nick opportunity, is wisdom in all things; and where such op∣portunities are most swift, most advertence is requisite not to slip the seasons; and herein lyes the necessary sagacity of a West Indian practicer, <HI>Hic labor hoc opus est,</HI> as will more evidently appear under our first To∣pick, <HI>viz.</HI> the necessary brisk moving Air.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the Air of</HI> Jamaica.</HEAD>
<P>THe Air of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> as it may have an agreement with all betwixt the Tro∣picks, is therein first to be considered, <HI>viz.</HI> in its general heat &amp; moisture, the one con∣temperating the other to render the Tor∣rid Zone habitable. Its heat is the necessa∣ry product of the neighbouring Sun, as its moisture is from that of the Moon; from both flow the beneficial as well as neces∣sary Brezes rendring the Air different from any on the other side the Tropicks, and therefore differently to be considered as the cause of Health and Diseases. Though the wind bloweth where it listeth, yet it's in general somewhat regular, and observes its times, and keeps or makes its seasons, no one whose observance hath been but slight, can easily doubt: For whilst the Sun by its direct Rayes threatens most to parch, then (as there is most need thereof) the more
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>forcible Brezes fan most: wherefore I stick not to conclude the Sun to be the ap∣parent cause of the brisk moving Air, or daily Sea Brezes, thereby rendring <HI>Apollo</HI> opportunely sollicitous of the health of his most immediate subjects by so reasonable provision therefore. For of necessity all things must be suffocated and dy between the Tropicks, did not the extraordinary heat generate the extraordinary winds to give a sutable supply of often to be chan∣ged breath, ventilating our Lungs with renovating changes of fresher air. Which happy effect though it acknowledge the Sun as its male parent, requires also as preg∣nant a Womb of receptive moisture to bring forth the happy and necessary Brezes: whereto the Moon, as a handy Midwife to Nature, most readily affords assistances, not only from her own moist Rayes, but by the signal power on the Ocean, where unloo∣sing the close saline Bonds of the briny Main, she adapts thereby the parts vola∣tile for a daily flight, as oft as the urging Sun stimulates the necessary succour of the cooling Brezes. But Brezes or mo∣ving Air being twofold, and generally pro∣ducing different effects, as well as they have different times of their blowing, force us to
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>assign a different cause of their productive originals. For as the Moon by loosing the saline Bonds of the Sea (which is demon∣stratively to be proved it doth) affords daily matter for the sea Brezes: So the stagnated Air, harbouring in mountainous Caverns and woody confinements, actuated by the night lights and starry influences, administer sufficient matter for the night winds called the land <HI>Brezes,</HI> both which differently impress in point of Health: For as the Sea Brezes partaking of the uni∣versal vivifying saline nature are found to be most healthful and agreeable to life, as resisting and defending from putrefaction; so the stagnated Air impregnated by mine∣ral <HI>Gas</HI> and the still variable Moon, never ceaseth to incline to alterative changes, and such as savour of putrefaction and death: wherefore from their cause, as well as we find by experience, I conclude, the two Brezes respect health variously: The solar and saline ones most concurring to health, as the Lunar and putrefactive ones do to death and dissolution. From the latter spring the great encrease and multiplica∣tions in the <HI>Indies,</HI> as from the former the worth and vigor of their product, both Brezes seem necessary from their cause,
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>and to their ends, and a virtue is to be made of such as well as a necessity entails them on the Places where they are found; betwixt both the Air is almost al∣ways kept in motion, which otherwise through its great heat and moisture must egregiously putrefy, and thence rather hatch the plagues of <HI>Egypt,</HI> producing In∣fects and such like generations, instead of more noble and perfect animals.</P>
<P>The division of Day and Night being smore equal throughout the year than in <HI>Europe,</HI> divides the seasons of those two sort of Brezes more equally, also they generally have neer twelve hours for their interchangeable blowings, though some∣times they may borrow of each other, <HI>viz.</HI> the Land Brezes intrench on the time of the Sea's, as the Sea Brezes do sometimes on the usual time of the land Bre∣zes: Besides the seasons of the norths which much alter the usual course of the Winds as well as of health. These norths are smart winds and cold, blowing from off the land with unusual force and continuance, being particular not general winds, either from the mountainous Tracts of <HI>Jamaica</HI> it self, and then only to be felt on the south side, and not far to Sea, or else arising from
<PB N="9" REF="13"/><HI>Cuba,</HI> and then chiefly if not only remar∣ked on the North side of <HI>Jamaica:</HI> But yet sometimes so strong as to excite the same effort of winds in the mountainous passages, where being increased, it's propa∣gated to the South, and becomes a thorow and severe North to the whole Island and neighbourhood of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which comes neerest to the windward Island tumultua∣ting Haricanoes, but never one quarter so mutinous or afflicting. The usual seasons of the Norths is while the Sun is most re∣mote in its <HI>Capricorn</HI> progress: For then the cold umbrages of the mountains have best opportunities to sally forth, while the over-ruling <HI>Phoebus</HI> is most absent with his strong sea Brezes: The season of these Norths is most fruitful in the cruciating Belly ach, and especially it endangers such who have been once afflicted therewith, likewise sore Eyes, sore Throats, and Tertians take oft this time of assaulting disposed Bodies,</P>
<P>But to return to our most usual and or∣derly diurnal and nocturnal Brezes, the better to defend from the latter as well as rejoyce in the former, besides what hath been said to both as to their effective originals, in their evident qualities
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>vastly differ: for the land Brezes have a far more sensible chilliness than those from the Sea; the general occasion as to the Air of the Tertian and Quartan Agues: for while the pores by daily Sweating or insensible transpirations are egregiously open, the suddain change of the land Brezes surprising the open Pores easily invade the disposed body with an aguish Inclina∣tion, Nature being sensible of her intruding Enemy oft violently shuts and keeps too too close the outlets of the skin, unadvisedly im∣prisoning what ought be discharged: hence the prisoners become a four ferment to the Juices of the whole body, first shivering and chilling the extream parts, and after in∣flaming the whole in a hot paroxysm; of which more under our Chapter of Diseases. It may not be improper to remark, that those Brezes of the night do less injury to new comers from the colder <HI>Europe,</HI> than to the more antient inhabitants, whose pores be∣ing as it were moulded into the bore of the Indian Air, are of larger size and more re∣ceptive of the chilling Brezes than such as come from the northern parts: hence also such as pass directly out of <HI>Europe</HI> hither are not so easily assaulted with fevorish attracts as those from the <HI>Carib</HI> Isles: for
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>those little tracts of land of <HI>Barbadoes, Nevis, Monserat, &amp;c.</HI> being well opened, and therefore affording nothing so much of night Brezes as the large woody mountains of <HI>Jamaica</HI> do, hath not inured them there∣to, while their greater diurnal heat hath suf∣ficiently disposed them to a most ready re∣ception of the night cold Invaders, of which more under the head of place. Let's here make some further progress, though on this airy Subject, and consider next it's thickness and moisture. That active heat rarefyes and thins, is very true; and therefore it may seem a Paradox, to assert the Air of <HI>Jamaica</HI> to be eminently thick, while the Clime is so hot: but yet that <HI>de facto</HI> it is so, and for great reason must be so, it behoves me to evince. Air as Air, in its self and with∣out additional mixtures, is to a proverb thin: so that to enquire into its first essentialls or quiddity ought to afford but a jejune noti∣on; yet as it causeth real effects, and carri∣eth so great a share of the most manifest im∣pressions of the Universe, it ought not to be neglected in a physical enquiry. Every one breathing knows or feels what's meant by the word; and as it hath generally been e∣steemed an element, it admits of no compo∣sing mixture. But since it is demonstrated of
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>late, to have great elasticity or central Spring of its motion, which alwayes ariseth from centration, or contraction of some∣what, I consider it therefore as a most thin vest or mantle of grosser bodies, without which our senses can act on nothing; and the which, as it's variously altered and changed by diversities and accumulations of bodies, becomes differently beneficial or noxious to life: but as in it self not stuff∣ed out with grosser bodies, it may well be apprehended as contracting and shrinking into its self: hence reasonably it may be most cold, and a general cooler: when there∣fore it's sensibly hot, it must necessarily be thick, and from the great resistance of its in∣mates be disposed to quickest motion, or without such motion it must necessarily re∣solve into putrefaction, and break up the old mansion for a newer dress or outward ap∣pearance. It may not be without some pro∣bable shew, that from this Elasticity of the Air, when refined and separated through the porous Lungs, that the <HI>Systole,</HI> or con∣tracting power of the heart may first be put into act, and that then the heart from its concentrated heat may be pushed into its <HI>Diastole</HI> or enlargement, so beginning and and so continuing our vital motions from
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>the same springs that give motion to the greater World. But to run that Elasticity to its first cause and the heat to its, would transport me into improper suggestions for this place, and therefore at least now I shall be content to take them both as I find them, <HI>viz.</HI> as they two constitute the <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> thick, yet brisk moving Air. There remains yet another necessary quality <HI>viz.</HI> that of Moisture: for thick and hot must be too harsh for life without softning moisture. Male qualities can never be be∣nign enough without amorous mixtures of Female softness; <HI>thus Male and Female cre∣ated he them, and they replenished the earth,</HI> The Air of <HI>Jamaica</HI> is eminent herein, and therefore most agreeable to women, be∣nificial to their living, incuding their con∣ceptions and facilitating their Births: but yet not so far impregnating, as if they, like the Spanish Ginnets, might be impres∣sed by the Wind to a fruitfulness, without the Airiness of a Male consort.</P>
<P>It's evident, maugre the false reports of the designing Spaniard concerning <HI>Jamai∣ca,</HI> that it abounds with Children, as who so when he lands at Port- Royal, may convince himself at the easie rate of his first sight. It's true, among so great a crowd of
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>young many will drop, as all the world over, ere they arrive their riper age. The moisture of their infant state complying with that of the air must necessarily breed worms, which is almost the whole of e∣vil, ordinarily besiegeth children to their hazard; of which in its more proper place. That the Air here is egregiously moist, the very keys in our pockets will easily o∣pen and demonstrate its truth, and that moisture is not only such, but notoriously nitrous; hence it may well work on mi∣neral bodies and corrode them with rust, as we see it doth. The great quantities of salt-Peter brought into <HI>Europe</HI> from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> evinceth its great store to be found in such like hot Countries as they are, and every way to be equalled by the West in all such products: from the same cause of abounding nitrous parts in the Air, our Rains are so fruitful and our Dews so vastly penetrating, that they equal if not out-do that of Snow water.</P>
<P>Hence it is, the moisture of our Air is not so putrefactive as might be expected from its heat and moisture, did not its Ni∣tre eminently season it with a saline pre∣servation. Neither yet doth our heat cause such thirst as the same would of ne∣cessity
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>in <HI>Europe:</HI> Forasmuch as the ni∣trous Air resolving clammy thicknings and furrings of our mouths, answers one end of moisture, and consequently prevents thirstings: From the same cause generally our bellies are more open and lax to the daily discharge of excrementions Bur∣thens.</P>
<P>It may not be improper being fallen in∣to this nitrous account of the Air, to speak something of that thundering salt, which hath made such a noise in the world, es∣pecially since the invention of Gunpow∣der, whose principal ingredient being Ni∣tre, hath brought it into daily remark as well as into greater use: Nitre therefore, to describe it, and make good the descrip∣tion by experiments, is to every ones taste a cooling Salt, to every ones experience volatile and greatly penetrating, therefore cleansing and scouring, possessed with a re∣markable Sulphur and an internal bitter∣ness. All which sensible qualities point at its being and compositions, which Na∣ture elaborates from various subjects, on which art it self in some most happily imitates. That all Air hath nitrous parts, though some far more then others, is no difficult belief: but how it comes by such
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>is nothing so easily to be evinced. The most eminent disposer of our visible heat is the Sun, all light contracted proves hot, and the extremity thereof Fire, the passage or <HI>medium</HI> of light from its great Source to the earth is soft yeilding Air; and that already hath been said to be a contracting vest of Bodies, and therefore it will not be hard to apprehend how it may invellope and grasp to it self warm Particles of light, and thereby give being to this universal inmate, <HI>viz.</HI> the Nitre of the Air which while but lightly tinctu∣red manifests but little thereof, but through daily renovations of the same action grows satiate, and falls by its own weight to the ground: Besides, from the Earth, and emi∣nantly from the Sea, the united reboun∣ding heat ascending its neerest air there∣in is captivated, and fashioned into this new form of nitrous Salt; and to conclude this deviation, the Sea salt it self, though so egregiously fixed, that Fire moves it little, even that is wholly converted into pure Nitre and a fixed insipid Earth, as by undoubted experience I have evinced to my self: So then for our great heat between the Tropicks, the moisture of the air and our neerness in <HI>Jamaica</HI> to the sur∣rounding
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>Sea: We cannot but expect, as we find our Air to be very nitrous, thence penetrating and thence cooling, averse in its nature to the coagulating stone, in hu∣mane Body a good defence and security against scorbutick affects, a true cooling Febrifuge. Hence our Fevers arerarely continued but generally intermitted ones, of which else where, hence to conclude this Chapter of the air of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the contagious plague is well and maturely prohibited inhabiting our Air, the which, to summ up all, is vifying hot, and multi∣plyingly moist, incorporating thick, and spirituously brisk and moving, by its ni∣trosity piercing and cleansing, in all most proper to increase life, sutable to the ne∣cessity of the place.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 2. <HI>Of the Place.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>JAmaica</HI> being an Island of its peculiar Form, scituated in the degrees of 17.29. with its references to its neighbou∣ring Islands and the South Continent be∣ing variously lyable to Currents, to Norths, South's, and South-west Winds. Its diur∣nal and nocturnal Brezes affords peculiar considerations, both as to seasons and states of health.</P>
<P>First as it is an Island, 'tis more sutable to Islanders; as to its form, it seems fitted for the resistance of Hariconoes, to which this Island hath not yet been, and I pre∣sume never may be subject: For the whole is a long narrow Tract of land, swelling in the midst into the continued heights of mountains, running from the East to the West: whereby the north Winds become divided from the South, and the East and West are both wedged asunder to the di∣minution of their force, from the figure
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>of the place. Therefore it becomes less lyable, if not wholly free, from those de∣structive tumults of huddling winds, which desolate sometimes and always at the seasons of their blowings affright other the lesser Islands: The figure of this Island resembles most a Saddle or many Saddles, the most inhabited and planted places are the plainer skirts and descents, as most neer the exporting and importing places of the Island. Yet the more remote moun∣tains are not without their eminent desira∣bleness, as being generally best wooded and watered, and when opened, most wholsome and agreeable, pleasant to the English Temperament, as being cooler and the Air thinner: Besides the mould is most unctuous and fruitful, having been a long time defended and shaded by its mighty Bowers, from the fierce Rapes of the fiery <HI>Phaebus.</HI> The coolness of the moun∣tainous tracts so vastly differing from the hotter neighbouring confines of the Sea, render health more difficultly to be pre∣served in those who pass immediately from one to the other, but that is for want of due advertency of one and the other place, and sutable provision for that change, which hereafter I shall sufficiently
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>remark, having experienced the same sufficiently on my self, to my satisfaction and safety: after first having suffered in such a travel, by the invasion of a severe Tertian. But to return to the more inha∣bited parts of this Island, and to salute our new Comers at the most eminent place of Port-Royal, which is seated on the south side of the Island, in the degrees 17.29. On the end of a long spit of sandy Land, after it having run twelve miles from the Mountains foot into the Sea, fra∣ming with other most admirable helps of the salt Pond, Mountains covert, the in∣comparable Land lockt Harbour most pro∣perly stiled Port Royal, a place as agreea∣bly seated for health and wholsome air, a for exportations and importations and de∣fence. The latter being more proper for others on sutable occasions, to expatiate on, I leave the healthy part to our present remarks, and therein matter of Fact hath sufficiently convinced me for nigh five years, and the reasonableness thereof bids fair to secure for the future. For the salt Wa∣ter washing it on both sides with the great preservative and balsamick friend of life, defends from putrefactive inclin∣tion, neither yet renders such a place in∣cident
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>to the Scurvy (as usually in cold northern Climes 'tis wont) for here the most fixed sea Salt through the nature of the Heat, Air, and heavenly <HI>Blas,</HI> is rea∣dily volatilized, and thereby cures in stead of causing scorbutick affects. This Spirit of Salt relieves what the fixed Salt inflicts in our northern Sea confines, of this well seasoned Air Port-Royal partakes doub∣ly for any other part of the Island, because seated in the midst of this preserving pi∣kle: So that when the land Brezes reach this place, they must needs be first blen∣ded with the well leavening Air of the Har∣bour it self, whereby its noxiousness be∣comes well corrected and far less injuri∣ous. Besides, the nature of this sandy tract is such, as well to concur with its wholsom air, for it's eminently dry, and thereby an imbiber of the greatest rains, leaving no stagnating Water to putrefy and corrupt the Air, thus the steril Sands become occasionally fruitful in healthfulness. And what is not so proper for Herbage is more happy in being agreeable to humane Na∣ture, and for propagating the Stock of <HI>A∣dam</HI> with the first signal blessing of <HI>increase and multiply.</HI> But I must not dwell too long in one place, having so much to touch at, e∣specially
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>the fair <HI>Ligania</HI> inviting their gree∣dy eye to a present inquiry. This compact settlement is joyn'd by its mountains Easterly to the first runnings out of our extended san∣dy tract, whereof Port-Royal graces as well as defends the one end, and these Mountains the other, which seem to make one point of a Bow, for such a figure best explicates <HI>Ligania.</HI> May it always abide in its strength, projecting its numerous shafts as their <HI>Decus</HI> and <HI>Tutamen</HI> of the whole Island: the string of this lovely Bow is the most convenient Harbour of Port Royall, from whence the expatiating levell Land and large <HI>Savan∣nas</HI> crowd backward the swelling Mountains many a fair Mile, affording a most benign Seat to numerous settlements: this pleasant tract is well advanced by its sweeter profit, while it unlades it self of great quantities of the best Sugar; and that so easily as to dissolve little by its transporting charge, which con∣ducing to its plentifull accommodations, and being thus nigh, daily supplies of conve∣niencies render <HI>Ligania</HI> to be a most grate∣ful and healthy place: the North west end whereof affords the other point of our Bow directing a further journey: for there the parting River of <HI>de Coure</HI> remembers us of <HI>St. Jago de la viega</HI> seated on the side
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>of the same about six Miles from the Har∣bour. It is this River which supplies the dayly drink of the Port, as well as its more neighbouring place, called Passage Fort, the fair hopefull beginning of a larger Town, distant from Port Royall about two leagues, quickly passed over by the delight∣full as well as the convenient transports of <HI>Jamaica</HI> built Wherries, whereof many a score plying both on the one side and the other side administer every way sutable convenience of most ready Communicati∣on. Thus we bring our new Comer from the sandy point to the more apparent <HI>Terra ferma</HI> of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where I being instead of a <HI>Mercury</HI> to the unacquainted, I cannot but tell him once for all, that this place as well as all our immediate bordering places on the sea round the whole Island are more proper for the well inured <HI>Jamaica</HI> Man than any later arrived persons: for the Air here as well as the water are rarely so good as more high in the well opened Country. Let's therefore being welcome here, pass on our most pleasant Road to the Town of St. <HI>Jago</HI> a very fair Town, through the enlarge∣ment of many streets beautified with di∣vers Churches and regular Buildings, while it was the Residence of the lazy Spaniards, who here contented themselves with easie
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>pleasure, comitted their planting to the care of their slaving Negro's: whereas now their more industrious successors live more sprin∣kled abroad, wheree're their thriving con∣cerns require the presence of the Master, lea∣ving this Town more thinly dwelt in, having first been much spoiled by the conquering Army or ruinous neglects since. However there remains yet a good seat for a large Town, being well accommodated with a free open Air, from the wide <HI>Savanna</HI> wherein it's plac'd, supplied with water from the Ri∣ver <HI>de Coure</HI> running by its side, furnished plentifull with the grasing Herds and Flocks, sporting in its view, though some∣times forced to go further a Field for their daily Food, the soyl having so long lay open to the sterilating Sun, it must needs be dry and afford more health to the Inhabitants of the Town than plenty of Herbage to their grasing Cattle. But the large quantity of their far extending <HI>Savannaes,</HI> and the skirts of woods well supply the shortness of their grass, in their dry times generally affording Milk for their Babes and good flesh for their stronger men. This Town being well seated both for health and the conveniency of the whole Island, becomes the place of
<PB N="25" REF="21"/>distributing Justice to the whole: the grand Courts being kept there, as well such as make as execute the laws; and to give life to all, our gracious Soveraign's media∣ted presence shines usually here in their Excellencies ordinary residences. After which I need say nothing more for St. <HI>Jago de viega</HI> but pass on in our pleasant <HI>Savan∣naes</HI> or Indian, Fields (for such these <HI>Savan∣naes</HI> are conjectured to have been) and while we journey, refresh our sight some∣times with the numerous herds of larger oxen, in whose labour there is profit, some∣times with the sporting of the wanton Calves, and delight our ears with the sweet breathed Cowes, whose lowings echoing make Rural musick, delightfull at least to the happy owners whose dwellings ever now and then salute the passengers with their innocent aspects: and by this time <HI>viz.</HI> of an hour we are arrived the Bridge, emi∣nent for it's remarkable good water; and here we must needs drink, as Custome is, and by drinking commend the same, as the best of any River water in <HI>Jamaica.</HI> When passed the Bridge, we still continue in o∣pen Air <HI>Savannaes,</HI> where jogging on we are still affected as before with the brutal Crowa, and soon after surprized with more
<PB N="26" REF="22"/>sutable appearances: For on the margin of the rising hils which still terminate our dexterous aspects; the most remarkable Sugar-works allure us thither: The stranger is apt to ask what Village it is (for every compleated Sugar-work is no less, the vari∣ous and many buildings bespeaking as much at first sight) for besides the more large mansion House with its offices, the works, such as the well contrived Mill, the spacious boiling House, the large re∣ceptive curing Houses, still House, com∣modious Stables for the grinding Cattle, lodging for the Over-seer, and white Ser∣vants, working Shops for the necessary Smiths, others for the framing Carpen∣ters, and Coopers: To all which when we add the streets of the Negroes Houses, no one will question to call such complea∣ted Sugar-Work a small Town or Village, as well for the number of the Inhabitants as Buildings, where since we are once come, it is but civil to wish them health, at least by remarking somewhat condu∣cing thereto, as first, though water is a most necessary conveniency, and its plen∣ty and goodness a great accommodation to such a settlement, yet forasmuch as the Air it self is very moist, we ought to co∣vet
<PB N="27" REF="22"/>as dry a living as may be, and there∣fore not to lodge our selves or servants, re∣ceptive of additional moisture either from Ponds or Rivers: For I have obser∣ved it matter of Fact where such care hath been omitted, more lives then elsewhere have flooded into <HI>Styx.</HI> Besides, for the great preservation, a dry lodging, remo∣ved at least one story from the ground, it is approved the best security of our white Servants; as for the Negroes, though their lodgings be neer the ground, they force off the moisture of the Earth by their con∣stant fires, and thereby become healthy, moreover I cannot but mention a necessary restraint on the profuse drinking of the Rum: Forasmuch as its excess most strangely renders skirrous the Liver &amp; Spleen, whence ill and waterish Blood and at length Drop∣sies, which intimation besides matter of Fact, I first received from the learned <HI>Johannes Antonides Vanderlinden,</HI> whose practice leading him to the observation of strange skirrous Spleens in <HI>Frisia,</HI> he reasonably concluded such to arise from their adusting Drink of Brandy, of which elsewhere: I on∣ly now admonish being strengthened with reason and observation, that the use of Rum exceed not the due proportion of the
<PB N="28" REF="23"/>judicious Adjuster: However if it chance to rain and wet the Labourers in the Field, it is agreeable if not necessary to fortify with a moderate Dram, and sometimes more liberally, thereby to encourage their strenuous exercise of dancing, whereby they may alleviate their slavery through delight as well as by exercising their Limbs adapt them more strong for work: Thus having visited one sugar Work for all, and seen the large <HI>Savannas,</HI> animated with flocks of Sheep, Herds of Cattel, and gangs of the <HI>Barbary</HI> breed Horses; we suppose their repeated continuance of the same through the precincts of St. <HI>Dorothy:</HI> St. <HI>Johns Vere, Clarendine,</HI> and St. <HI>Eliza∣beth.</HI> Through all which, though worthy of visiting, it were too tedious to travel our new Comer, I will only now refresh him with a surpassing Rarity, of a most strange Tree or two, worth his pains to vi∣sit: The one is a shining Tree, which a∣bout the Month of <HI>November</HI> bears such starry lights on its Body or Bark, that the Horse as well as the unknown Travel∣ler is strangely affrighted thereat, 'tis a living as well as thriving Tree: Not such an one whose rotten wood may solve the appearance, neither doth any
<PB N="29" REF="23"/>Gloworm or such like Animal lodge there, to give us the reason of the light, neither yet is it a transient shining made by any re∣flections of light elsewhere, but it is such as to abide some miles carrying it, and some hours after its separation in a small part of the bark from the Tree it self: For I car∣rying the same in my pocket, and after looking for my wooden Gem found its lustre persevering, so that I read by the light thereof, and by most exact scrutiny I could never observe Worm or liquid Gum superadded, but by the next morn (for this was about midnight) my once lighted Bark shews me nothing else but its ordi∣nary dark self: This Tree did not only once impose on the credulous fancy or di∣sturbed Brain of a single person, but eve∣ry year shews the like to who so lists to view it; besides there be more then one such trees, and in divers places of the I∣sland, of which its observed they shine most sparklingly and vivid in the darkest night, and especially after a shower of Rain. Whether this may have any affinity with the burning Rush, I dare not determine, but having by one Rarity prepared the cu∣rious, I shall less surprise by another, which is a Tree or shrub bearing animal seeds:
<PB N="30" REF="24"/>to the which the plants called sensitive, whereof there's plenty here, are trifling and inconsiderable. For these seeds have an internal spring of motion, jumping up and down without any touch like the usu∣al sensitive Plants, to make them contract themselves, neither from applicating or contracting dryness do they take their Rise, and then have done, as several seeds will often spart themselves from suchlike Causes. But our far stranger seed hath more then one motion: For touch you each and you will perceive a pulse (besides in your own fingers) plainly throbbing in the hollow seed it self: And yet further and more strange, lay two of the same on the Table, they will skip many a fair jump above a span high, and further to surprise, they steer their motion one to the other, though placed at distance on the table. The seeds will continue those frolicks many days: But thendecline in their vigor, till they leave us destitute of the pleasure they first af∣forded: The seed is externally convex and oblong, internally concave and adapted to a true adjustment with four other seeds in one common inclosure of a brown Colour light and hollow within, where (for I o∣pened them) appeared nothing to exer∣cise
<PB N="31" REF="24"/>our conjecture about; only matter of Fact convinced the various senses of its ex∣traordinary appearances: The which be∣ing so great, I am glad it was seen by a multitude, and at diverse times, and more eminently to confirm the certainty by the highly sagacious and most just observer, his excellency my Lord <HI>Vaughan</HI> our most happy Governour, who ordered his Gar∣diner to cultivate some of the same seeds for a further growth, which being at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> we will suppose our inquisi∣tive Traveller returned thither. And since he hath hitherto seen our <HI>Savanna</HI> Country, now for a more delightful mix∣ture and variety sake we will steer a course of another nature: for as the former progress was with the extended length, and as it were with the grain of the Country, at least on the South side: So now wee'l cross and run athwart to the North side of our more narrow <HI>Jamaica,</HI> following as much as may be the natural cut through the Mountains, which the rapid Rivers and violent Rains through a long duration of time, hath effected more powerful then <HI>Hannibals</HI> Vinegar through the <HI>Alpes.</HI> It's four miles from St. <HI>Jago</HI> ere we need take the advantage of this way-preparing River
<PB N="32" REF="25"/><HI>Coure,</HI> and then we chiefly make use of its marginal Cut, elaborated by many hands and continual Industry, preserved a tole∣rable good path, at least such as is most strangely different from any other, af∣fecting the pensive passenger with new thoughts from the unusual novelties pre∣sented to his passing eye: For now he rides at the bottom or neer the same of the high Mountains split a sunder to wall in the Pas∣senger on both sides from stragling devia∣tions, pleasantly imprisoning him in his own way, which like to that of the Sty∣gian Lake can nere be missed: And here it is reasonable to look before us, as well for our pleasure as preservation, although we can be but short sighted, being soon ter∣minated in our prospect by a rocky up∣right Wall exceeding far both in height and strength, that of <HI>China</HI> or any other what∣soever artificial one. For here Nature her self is prodigal in the number and big∣ness of her rocky Tablets, heaped one on the other to a portentous crowd of the up∣rear'd structure, as if the Giants of old had here begun their work of invading the <HI>Em∣pyraeum.</HI> And lest the horror of these daring Rocks affright too much by their threat∣ning Imminency, Mother Nature hath
<PB N="33" REF="25"/>kindly mantled them with a green vesture of delighting Trees strangely ranging one over the other, as if the superior were roo∣ted on the tops of the inferior, propaga∣ting various lengths of (as it were) Trees to a portentous height, and least such con∣tinued sights should glut the eye, the bare supporting Wall peeps out now and then with its scraggy aspects, to render the scene more solemn: Especially while the hoarse murmuring River sets the Base to the shrill Choristers of the wood, &amp; affects the Daugh∣ters of musick as well as the enamored eye at the same time, by all which unusual pleasure we beguile our selves of our way till it brings us to the Elizian plains, a most pleasant Vale opening her kind Bosom to re∣ceive us from the passed shades into the more open Air of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in the vale or sixteen mile walk, where to a wonder notwithstanding its surrounding Mountains and great ascending Fogs which skreen off the morning Sun some hours, it hath hitherto been reputed a wholesom and healthy place, greatly plantedand almost crowded with the greatest settlements; but steering our Northern course we leave this vale behind us, and ascending succes∣sive mountains are led by the exalted Rid∣ges
<PB N="34" REF="26"/>forward, not without memorials of the path to Heaven: Few hours are spent ere we descend the settled skirts of the North side of our <HI>Jamaica</HI> Saddle, where we may congratulate our selves returned to the temperament of an English May. It's almost past credence that so sinall distance should afford so great difference of heat and cold: Here the Air is most keen and thin, shutting up the too open Pores to a better husbandry of profuse sweatings, calculated more agreeable to the Meridian of the South side, where such sweatings are no less then necessary, but here scarcely convenient. Neither herein only are the North and South side differenced, but more eminently in their various seasons For whereas the South side summer or most direct neighbourhood of the Sun brings in the Rains, and when the Sun is more remote in its <HI>Capricorn</HI> progress, our dry times are generally observed, 'tis quite contrary on the North side, for there the more eminent seasons of Rain, make the Winter in its most proper time, and leave the summer like that of the English to be more dry. Hence, if my conjecture fail not, the North side is in its self, as it is found by good experience to be, most proper
<PB N="35" REF="26"/>for the desirable <HI>Cacaa.</HI> The Rains most opportunely drenching the luxuriant Tree to its great satiety and overflowing fruit∣fulness, which rains on the South side being deficient about the time of <HI>Cacaas</HI> bearing, leave the succulent Tree too dry, and therefore pining for want of its desi∣rable fruit, as if the voice of Nature in the <HI>Cacaa</HI> Tree cryed <HI>give me Children or else I dye;</HI> everything is beautiful as well in its place or season. Wherefore seeing Na∣ture seems to adapt the North side to this Indian Treasury; and hath already well stored this proper place through planting dilligence, with a hopeful prospect of this its enriching produce, it were too great a neglect to omit visiting a <HI>Cacaa</HI> Walk: For so ground orderly planted therewith in regular walks, is called, wherein the <HI>Cacaa</HI> and Plantain Trees are orderly and successively ranged the one to shelter the other, lest the preying Sun suck up too much of the moisture naturally benign to the <HI>Cacaa</HI> Tree as well as to break the force of the too boisterous winds, lest such should chance to injure the delicate Plant. These attendant Trees called Plantains give novelty of aspect to our Northern Stranger, no Tree whatsoever in the cold
<PB N="36" REF="27"/>Countries affording so large and so broad a Leaf, the which copiously lodge the en∣riching dew, and retails it to its neigh∣bouring Plant, sprinkling the pearly drops as the wind moves the yielding leaves; Nei∣ther is this the only fruit of the Guardian Tree, for it is loaded with a weighty bunch of clustering Plantains (for so the fruit is called) whereof both bread and drink with smallest trouble are provided, not only for the labouring Slaves, but grateful to their Masters palate: A food far excee∣ding Potatoes, at least in point of health as nothing so readily breeding worms or such who live thereon: This Fruit before its immature roughness (of which it emi∣nently partakes) is removed by the sweet¦ness of the ripening Sun, is a most ready astringent in our ordinary debilitating Flux∣es. But the service of these Plantain Trees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> least in our <HI>Cacaa</HI> Walk advance us four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> five paces further, and then imploy th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> greedy eye no longer on themselves b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> on a far more affecting object, <HI>viz.</HI> the delightful <HI>Cacaa</HI> Tree: A Tree of that sin¦gular beauty as to gratify the marvelling eye of each beholder, for bigness not ex¦ceeding our Cherry-trees; its large, broad oblong leaf, falls back, and hangs with
<PB N="37" REF="27"/>kind of native fondness to its productive original, like so many shields to defend the tender Tree from the descending injuries, the colour of the leaf is solemn and grave with a deep verdure. Its fruity Jewel is most admirably set, studding the very bo∣dy of the Tree with its luxuriant Treasure, enameling with yellow and red, not only the verdant Boughs but barky substance and body of the Tree from the very earth upwards, each cod (for in such this Trea∣sury is crowded) Cabinets about thirty two Nuts orderly set in a soft Bed of sweet slimy pulp, to preserve as well as nourish the tender fruit. To say the truth at once, the whole Tree is a <HI>non pareil,</HI> an Indian Treasury: For the very Nuts among the Indians and Spaniards go currant as lesser money, even there whence the greatest part of the currant Coyn of the whole world is brought, 'tis their Riches, their Food, their Delicacy, and all in one. Of this so useful, so profitable commodity, the North side of this Island is most richly stored as well as through the goodness of the mould, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> very fit for the more speedy unlading Sugar Cane, which by suffi∣cient experience is found here not inferior to the best, besides the great quantity of
<PB N="38" REF="28"/>Fustick; the Bay Tree or spicy <HI>Piemento</HI> perfume the woods with profitable sweets, to which our <HI>Winter</HI> Bark or West Indian Cinnamon Tree adds its help to embalm the Air, while the creeping <HI>China</HI> paves our footing with its eminent restorative Roots, too easy at hand to be valued to their intrin∣sick worth: <HI>(ex pede Herculem)</HI> from the little yet discovered we may guess at the more unknown Treasure. Its Woods, Plants, Seeds, Fruits, Stones requiring more ages than one to bring them to light, it may suffice at least for my first attempts to have presented this one hudling Cluster of our first more obvious commodities. A more retired inquisition, when the desira∣ble Country shall be my chief study, may hereafter (God willing) be superadded, in the mean while I have thus lightly touched at the nature of the place both on the North and South side of the Island of <HI>Jamaica;</HI> There remains my third Hippo∣cratical head, and there under to speak more distinctly of the water of this place.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 3. <HI>Of the Water of</HI> Jamaica.</HEAD>
<P>HOw necessary Water is to life, and how differences of water do vari∣ously affect the life not only of the vegeta∣tive, but of the breathing world, though readily it will be confessed, yet oft it's less considered than the improvement of such an object may well require at our hands: Especially in those places where water is the common drink of the most, as well as the most proper for all. To search out the fountains of the deep, and enquire after the original Source of waters may seem an extravagancy as well as too needless a Re∣trospect; yet forasmuch as the inquisitive mind is never satisfied without it ascend to the first cause of things, and even the first as such intimates a principle yet prior to the cause, I presume to guess at the princi∣pations of waters, and thence assign them one of the first appearing causes or mat∣ter of all visibles, and therefore not to be
<PB N="40" REF="29"/>neglected in this our Chap. of Water, re∣lating to Health, or the interruption there∣of by Diseases. Without presumption I may take <HI>Moses</HI> for my best guide to the origination of things, especially since par∣ticularly he hath written there, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. For he not only as enlightened <HI>by the Candle of the Lord</HI> with other men: But as ascen∣ding into the Mount, and by the special light of the burning Bush, peeping neerest into the thick darkness, thence knew how to commence the generations of the Heavens and the Earth; for darkness was first on the face of the Deep: Not dark∣ness as a privation of light, because it was first but darkness as a fit sheath to enshrine the after to be produced light: Darkness as the curdling power and confining Ta∣bernacle of the first breath, or going forth of the Almighty: Thus he makes darkness his Pavilion, and characterizeth his other∣wise unintilligible Word to the modes and measures of after to be created Beings, fit∣ted to take in by piece meal, what was im∣possible in the whole to be apprehended, therefore the Spirit of God is said to move first on the Face of the waters: The Spi∣rit cannot move without the Word, nor the Word without Light, nor the Light be
<PB N="41" REF="29"/>apprehensible but by a confinement or ter∣mination which is darkness on the face of the Deep, or on the face of the waters, which is all one and the same: For the face of the waters, <HI>viz.</HI> the external term thereof, being nothing but darkness, was ere the waters were brought forth, for the Waters being creatures were made by his word, and his first word was <HI>Let there be light,</HI> where, but in the darkness, which being the <HI>Horizon,</HI> the confinement, the vale of the light, and that light being ac∣cording to true weight and measure adjust∣ed to its covering vest, make the first pure fluid. The first essentiated waters not yet contaminated but very living, and waters of life natural, a pure Mirror for the Al∣mighty to see, and by seeing to bring forth his eternal <HI>Ideas,</HI> and render them visible in a World of creatural Beings.</P>
<P>Hence all our knowledge in and of this World may well be said to be as in a mirror darkly, and that not tropically only but truly and naturally, for the nature of all created Beings taking their Source hence, <HI>viz.</HI> from the originating waters, all we see is truly and radically in each thing, nay all that becomes communicative any wise to our supply, first expands it self towards
<PB N="42" REF="30"/>this Fountain head: All seeds are reduced into a watry expansion ere they multi∣ply, all Foods become dissolved into li∣quids ere they nourish, and the external sign of the great and mystical Renovation descending into waters, the significant Sacrament adjusting our Religion to the principles of our Nature; therefore who∣so violates the one to engraft the other, and destroys the man to make a Bigot, runs counter to the alwise at his own peril. God begins his new creation neer where he did the first, and both from waters, though different products flow from one and the other, or else infinity would be strait∣ned, from which, as contradictory, nature abhors; or do the same work twice which would tax of infirmity, or want of power or wisdome: wherefore almost an infi∣nite variety must necessarily emerge from this self same original, which though so vastly differing, yet all agree in water, which water were it equally pure, all e∣qually limpid and agreeable, there would be no need I should assign the water of <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> as one Topick for my discourse con∣cerning Health and Diseases there. But since it is so receptive of divers Forms and mixtures, and so becomes more or less a∣greeable
<PB N="43" REF="30"/>to humane life and health, from its great diversity of Allays and corrup∣tions, my duty is to remark the good, and and characterize the less good, or directly noxious, or at least stimulate others to do it better. The most general allowed Test of waters is their lightness, of which the best partakes most: Whereby all mineral wa∣ters, though never so limpid are first to be excepted against, at least in the way of nourishment, though not as to medicinal effects. Sometimes desirable mountanous places, such as <HI>Jamaica,</HI> hide in their tee∣ming Bellies store of the subjects of the mineral Kingdome, and therefore the wa∣ters issuing thence are first to be distin∣guished, hence the first settling Spaniards named the River that passes by the Town of St. <HI>Jago Rio de Coure,</HI> or the Copper River, being it is tainted with issuings forth of some or many Copper Mines, chiefly discernable in the time of Floods and Freshes, when the mountainous Rain wash down the Creeks and Guts, in the otherwise wholsome Current, at which times the prudent Spaniard drank not thereof, nor at other times, without first settling the same in Jars, whereby the mineral <HI>Ocra</HI> had time to subside and sepa∣rate
<PB N="44" REF="31"/>the vomitive virtue from their drink, which laudable custome continues to their Successors, who generally take up the next days water in the precedent evening, which while the careless neglect, they oft pay for it to their sorrow, though they con∣sider less the cause thereof than the im∣portance requires. This same River after having run some purging miles becomes the usual drink of Port-Royal, for the most part more wholsome there than at the Town of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> because by its cur∣rent more defaecated from its mineral In∣mate, which demonstration of weight will easily evince to the curious, not but that even this water brings sometimes its taint with it to the Port, through the discharge of the many salt Springs neer Cabbage Tree bottome, and the neighbouring pla∣ces, of which my curiosity hath prompted me to taste; but then being casked up (for so our water is conveyed to the Point) and standing sometimes in its new Inclosure, ere we drink thereof, give's time to the subsiding alien: The care remains that the Cask be always well washed when the supplies of water are required in the same Vessel, otherwise the mineral <HI>Ocra</HI> may contaminate the latter received Te∣nent,
<PB N="45" REF="31"/>continuing the alien taint till it be imbibed by the drinkers, who unknow∣ingly all on a suddain fall into Fluxes and Gripes, especially new Comers who not yet used thereto are much affected thereby, nay the country planters coming rarely to the Point, suffer oft the like from the same cause: To avoid all which both at St. <HI>Ja∣go</HI> and the Port, it were much to be desi∣red that both one and the other would sup∣ply themselves with water elsewhere, <HI>viz.</HI> that they of the Town would be at the trou∣ble as the wiser Spaniards were to fetch their water from the Bridge, from the Ri∣ver called the black River, and they of the Point from the Rock (a place so termed neer the Harbour) both which afford sig∣nally good water. As for the Well waters wheresoever they are used, as too frequent they are especially in <HI>Ligania,</HI> they are found too heavy for our necessary brisk circulation of Blood, besides their remain∣ing grosser parts prove oft obstructive in∣mates, administring too frequent occasions of our dry Bellyach and Dropsies. Pond water as either arising from higher Springs or containing Rain water, both farther concocted of the Heavens, makes a more wholsome than delightful water; yet
<PB N="46" REF="32"/>such as is most fit for brewing our cold drinks (as they call them) with being most susceptive of a fermenting power to work and thereby render them more wholsome. Providence hath plentifully watered this Island with great variety of copious Rivers, besides lesser Springs almost every where to be found, but more in the mountanous than valy Land. And such affording more wholsome drink by how much the higher the ascent of such is, hence though we mount not without some straining diffi∣culty the aspiring heights of Hills, we are well recompenced by the excellency of the water, usually found there more cleer, more pure, and far cooler, truly slacking and not exasperating, as some waters do, the deceived thirst: for on such Eminen∣ces the water is usually best digested and separated from injurious aliens (especially there no mineral Taints are blended there∣with) such are most usually met with in their descending traces, not in the first ruptions on the tops of mountains: for there∣to mineral waters cannot well aspire, for their depressing weight hurries such to their more proper place, and brings them to the mouths of the lazy, who not taking pains for the best must be contented with
<PB N="47" REF="32"/>the worser. <HI>Sed quis ascendet in montem Domini,</HI> he alone is secure of the true na∣tural waters of life which in their pure vi∣tality promise length of days and clarity of Spirits. It's more than ordinary brisk∣ness they usually shine to the very eye with, besides, the discerning Palate or yet the more intelligent Stomach quickly discover their agreeableness, thus as we as∣cend to the fountain of all blessings, we neer∣er partake of his more immediate goodness in vital gifts, which are mixed more and more the lower they descend: Therefore it is worth while to receive such at the first hand on the mountainous eminences of Na∣ture, framed as it were for the contented aspirer, who there still satiates himself with elemental purity, and thereby hath less fear of jarring discords to the dissolu∣tion of his Frame. As <HI>Helmont</HI> remarks in his Chap. of the Mountain of the Lord, all Nations, saith he, inhabiting the moun∣tains are of an hardier body and of a more vigorous and flowrishing life than those who inhabit pleasant Fields, which effects do manifest their cause: for a more sweet and purer Air is there imbreathed and e∣very <HI>Gas</HI> being deprived of its filth returns into the pure matter of water: Fur∣ther,
<PB N="48" REF="33"/>it is in such mountains are found the highly sublimed Dews plenteously enrich∣ed with Heavens Treasure, and separated from terrene clogs to afford a kind of elix∣irated water transcending all others what∣soever, especially for those whose longer durance in such places hath adapted them for so pure a Drink, too penetrating for grosser Bodies, as endangering too sudden a change, which nature will never brook to be forced to at once, but is easily led by preparatory steps of a thin Blood and re∣ctified Juices: 'Tis then our Mountanist may drink this liquid <HI>Manna,</HI> and live more healthy and longer than others else∣where. Besides the ordinary supplies of Rivers, Springs, Ponds, Wells from Hea∣ven it self in copious Rains, and refined Dews; there grow large Withs, for so they are called, most frequent in the most dry places, as it were providentially to ob∣viate the thirsty, which being cut, pour out a cleer well tasted and wholsome wa∣ter to satiate the bewildred Traveller, of which our Hunters serve themselves fre∣quently: I may here add the remarkable Coker Nut Tree, a Tree well provided with all necessaries of life, as for Cloa∣thing, Meat and Drink, and Vessels of
<PB N="49" REF="33"/>use, besides it affords a most grateful as∣pect while it ascends direct and high, wea∣ring its tuft of palmy Branches aloft, whose monthly clusters of large capaci∣ous Nuts, at their due successive times, sup∣ply a pleasant milky water both for the slacking of thirst and good nourishment: for if it be urged by the Fire, it gellies into a natural Custard, otherwise it is a cleer agreeable water well answering the Indi∣cations of an hectick Heat, cooling, moist∣ning, and sweetning, and nourishing, at the same time, of which notwithstanding a too cool Stomach may take too much; and thereby be chilled into a disadvanta∣gious weakness. But such water as that of the Coker Nut being more appropri∣ated to the industrious Planter than it is common to all (for <HI>usus est communis a∣quarum</HI>) we need take no further notice thereof; but we'll conclude <HI>Jamaica</HI> to be plentifully watered, and that with great choice, among which some give no place to the best in the world, and to which the long living <HI>Jamaica</HI> Man must necessari∣ly addict himself for his most usual drink, of which we may see further under our next head of the Customs and Manners of li∣ving.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 4. <HI>Of the Customs and Manners of living.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe consideration of the Customs and Manners of living, is no way an a∣lien speculation from our scope of de∣sired health, but the neglect thereof often much contributes to diverse Intempera∣tures, undavisedly drawn on ourselves, for the want of substituting new Indian ones in the place of our proper native man∣ners and usages in living. I confess it is deeply natural, where ere we are, to adhere to our earliest implanted inclinations, wherefore though we change our place we seem loth to change our ingeny, but needs, though with less reason than's fit, we transport northern chilly propensities, and customs thereon depending, into the southern hot Climes, and most improper and destructive to health, at least long life: we retain our ancient English humor (most desirable in its proper place) as to eating
<PB N="51" REF="34"/>and drinking, and other the acts of Na∣ture no way to be neglected or perhaps diminished, only in an order sutable to the change of the place, to be better hus∣banded for the vigor of Nature and pro∣longing of Life. The quantity, times, and quality of our English Drink and Food, ought, according to the best of my reason, to be wholly changed for other more na∣tural and agreeable to the clime and cir∣cumstances of living. As for the quan∣tity we neither ought to eat so much or so little as may well agree in <HI>England,</HI> for excess in either cannot so suddain threaten life there as here, for Nature is not so yare with her delinquents in the cold northern Tracts as between the Tropicks, where all motions being necessarily more quick, the punishment of all Intemperances afford less time for Repentance: the quantity therefore ought to be lesned one way and increased another, <HI>i.e.</HI> we may well eat more at more times and less at each, where good supplies administer a plenty. It must be for health and continuance of strength to eat at least four times in twenty four hours, <HI>viz.</HI> Chocalata at six in the morn, at Ten dine more sparingly than the English, at four afternoon repeat Chocalata, between
<PB N="52" REF="35"/>seven and eight a plentiful supper may be best admitted; to drink between meals may not be forbidden in a hot Country as this, for whoso lists may properly take a plentiful Draught of water, as it is usual for some before they take their Chocalata, but by no means soon after, as strictly pro∣hibited by the observing Spaniard: How∣ever at other times a large Draught of the pure crystalline naturally well con∣cocted Water, may well refresh and con∣tribute to render our Bloods thin, and cir∣culate the better: and lest such at some∣times should chill the Stomach too much, the Spanish custome of eating candied warm Fruits and Roots after such draughts may be esteemed reasonable, such as can∣died Limes, Orenges, Ginger, Marma∣lade of <HI>Guavas</HI> quiddinies, of Citrons, to be taken in little quantities as we usual∣ly do Cheese after meat for concoction. When the Sun declines, the warm Spirit of the Grape most properly may be admitted, and that to a natural warmth, not an ine∣briating Fire, to whet appetite and better perform the digestion of the greater meal, as well as to fortify against the nigh moisture of the Air, and powers of the neer Moon. And now it being not out of the way, but
<PB N="53" REF="35"/>conspiring to the great design of health and life, we may well remark the Wines proper and improper for our careful <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> Drinker, and herein we may consi∣der the great providence and bounty of the All-wise and All-good disposer of his creati∣on. For as there is no place so conveni∣ently seated for the quick and commodi∣ous conveyance of Wines to the western World, as the <HI>Maderas</HI> and her neigh∣bours: So neither is there any wine so well adjusted to the wants and profitable refreshings and safety of the Drinkers, as such Wines are, they being as it were a <HI>me∣dium</HI> between other Wines and Bran∣dy, not so hot as the latter, nor so mild as the former, but of a good war∣ming nature against the daily large ex∣pence by heat and sweating, adapted to circulate her thick blood: For such we are liable to here, sutable to the brisk motions necessary to this swelling part of the Globe. Besides, such wines afford agood pleasant mixture with water, and thereby become most useful here, where water is our most natural and common drink. Again contra∣ry to other wines, which are best preser∣ved to the pleasure and the profit of the Drinker in cold places and cellars, these
<PB N="54" REF="36"/>as it were complying with the place they were designed for, preserve themselves though in a warm Repository, and grow sower and eager in a more cool. Having therefore so good and agreeable conditions in our <HI>Madera</HI> Wines, we may better dis∣pense with the absence of French Clarrets and white Wines, as also the too heavy (as usually ordered) Canaries and Sacks, for these, more especially the balderdashed Clarrets, the covetous Brewers and Cor∣rupters thereof seldome send them without having one part thereof burnt to serve the funerals of those they have killed. It were not without shew of Justice that such who first exposed them to the publick nusance of life should drink most of such them∣selves, whereof if they dy, they may have a stake driven through their Corps as Fe∣lons <HI>de se:</HI> But the unrighteous <HI>Mammon</HI> accruing from such Merchandize will make them better friends and entail the danger on the innocent Purchaser, whom as I ought I do warn thereof, wishing him to drink his own health in the safe <HI>Maderas,</HI> such being every way accommodated to cautious <HI>Jamaica</HI> Drinkers. But lest while I talk of the <HI>Madera</HI> Wines with a fee∣ling <HI>gusto,</HI> I may seem to forget my self
<PB N="55" REF="36"/>and loose my way, Il'e return more direct∣ly to my discourse, where I left my regula∣ted man at his good supper, to supply the large expences of the Day, as well as to provide carefully for the night, which ought to be spent not without circumspe∣ction, our greatest dangers arising thence, <HI>viz.</HI> from the great chilling moistures of the Moon, and the influence of the other man alluring Planet felt by the amorous, from whence the due moderation of Rea∣son ought carefully to defend the Males, who, for want of advertency herein and o∣ther things, dye four or five to one of the other Sex. I mean the virile Males to the sutable Females, and the reason is not ve∣ry obscure, for whoso spends two hun∣dred pound in one place, as oft as in ano∣ther he could but one single hundred, must assoon again be bankrupt, which is much the state of the forementioned case: wherefore let our moderation be known herein by prolonging our lives through alteration of customs to a sutable adjust∣ment of Nature and Place. But of this e∣nough; to please therefore, let me return to my Chocalata, wherewith I begin the orderly and properly supplies of the day. And here dame Nature smiles me thinks
<PB N="56" REF="37"/>as it were shewing her self in love with humanity by such a provision both for the individual and species in one single nou∣rishment: Had the Poets known hereof, they had made this single Food serve their Deities in both Capacities of Meat and Drink, for such it, is being moderately hot as its agreeable bitterness witnesses, and refreshing moist as its cool oyl suggests, and thereby most fitly nourisheth and slac∣keth thirst at the same time.</P>
<P>If to any Thirst ensue the drinking there∣of, or whereso it may disagree with the Sto∣mach, as sometimes it may, it signifies such of no good west Indian temper, at least at present; or that the place doth not naturally agree with such an one: For as∣much as all Natives I ere observed most greedily desire it from their infancy, and if ever they refuse Chocalata, it signifies they need rectifying their State. Where∣fore it is not only a Food, but a natural test of Health, for when the Stomach hath too much choler, as to quarrel with Cho∣calata, it indicates evacuation thereof ne∣cessary and expedient, or some other pro∣vision for regulating of disordered temper, but luxury is too prone to vitiate the gifts of Nature by corrupting her simplicity,
<PB N="57" REF="37"/>for a better provision to the satisfying of lusts, which as entrenching on the inte∣grity and duration of life, I ought not to insinuate but casheir the high aromatick mixtures and perfumes of the otherwise much better Chocalata, such burthening the Stomach, which else with fresh and renewed appetite would continually grace the sincere Chocalata: Egs likewise gra∣duate it too high for a constant usage, wherefore while I recommend a daily re∣petition and that doubly of this our west Indian Ambrosian Nectar, I intend the simple well ground and adapted Nut and water, with so little Sugar as to preserve somewhat of the natural bitterness of the <HI>Cacaa,</HI> which is most grateful to the Sto∣mach; whoso listeth may consult <HI>Hernan∣des,</HI> P. 8. and find there three sorts, and chuse which pleaseth him best: The anci∣ent Indians contented themselves often with the bare Nut in their travelling, eat∣ing two or three of them at a time and drinking water, to make the composition more natural in their digesting Stomachs: With the better composition, yet still as neer nature as may be, I would have the regular living <HI>Jamaica</HI> man institute one half of his sustenance, it being not only
<PB N="58" REF="38"/>very easy of digestion, but affording solid and lasting nourishment against the devouring heat of the near Sun: For the oily parts sup∣ply with genuine moisture his otherwise apt to be too much parched Body, rendring the muscular Fibres apt to motion, levening the Stomach with renovated ferment, supplying the Bowels with defensive ar∣mature against corroding defluxions, as well as making the same slippery for the advantage of their peristaltick motion: For the Kidney I find nothing more ge∣nuine than Chocalata, moving a more plentiful Urine, and also administring a balsamick quality to the Ulcers, oft incident to those parts, provided spices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be o∣mitted. To particularise all the useful con∣veniences of this single fruit, would require more paper than this small manual can ad∣mit; to shew what convenient and nou∣rishing Food (in time when it shall be plenty enough) it might administer to Armies and royal Navies, would swell as beyond our stint. What use the hard white Butter separated from the Nut, what pleasant fermenting Juice the washing of the slimy fruit may afford, to what great uses they may well concur, I must curb my self in full relations; being to proceed
<PB N="59" REF="38"/>from the morning proper food unto the ten of the clock Meal, wherein I would change the times of eating in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and that because of the too neer hea∣ting Sun at high noon more inclining to a <HI>Seasto</HI> than any thing else: Let the Table be therefore spread never later than ten of the Clock, where first the delicious well concocted Musmillion most temptingly presents, both the oblong and white one as well as the more round and red one, as al∣so the water Million, the superlative Pine, various Orenges and Lemons, Citrons, Pomegranates, Cushewes, Grapes, Dates, maiden Plantains, Bonanoes, Cherries, Tamarinds, Nasburies, sower Sops, Pin∣guins, with many other, each in their sea∣sons supplying the whole summer year with a plentiful first service, proper for this time of day and the place of living. Next good Broths, with Mutton, Goat, or Fowls, well cooled with Purslain, Lettuce, Sorrel, Papas thickned with Potatoes, Yams rendred stomatick with our red Pep∣per as wholsome as the east Indian, serves very agreeable both to nourish and moist∣en, or else Piloe, for which our native Rice may serve, as a food easy of digestion may well be admitted likewise the young <HI>Ocra</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="39"/>an agreeable Food as well for the species as individual, dressed variously according to pleasure, besides the Family of <HI>Legumi∣na,</HI> of which there are more then thirty sorts, relished with salted Pork, which Flesh here greatly excels, or powdered Beef, rather in compliance with the English great inclination to Flesh than otherwise, for the lighter or easiest digested food is always most proper here for digestion, as all the works of nature here are and ought to be most speedy, to comply with the uni∣versal briskness of motions betwixt the Tro∣picks. Wherefore the vast variety of Fish are found a great as well as a most sutable nutriment, and the Natives though des∣cended from great flesh eating Parents prefer a Fish diet, and whatso is easily convertible to humane service, before stubborn flesh, (for such all flesh is com∣paratively) a demonstration, what the na∣ture of the place requires, and therefore to be complied with by the reasonable ob∣server: And here, it being not an impro∣per place, let me recite with thankful ac∣knowledgment to divine Bounty the de∣lightful wholsome as well as plentiful store of nourishment, which the boundless O∣cean, as well as many retailing Rivers on
<PB N="61" REF="39"/>all sides pour in upon us, in which recital I must needs give the first place, for more reasons than one, to the Bountiful Turtle, a strange as well as useful Creature, vast∣ly answering necessity in living through its quantity of convenient Food, as well as gratifying the curious palate with extraor∣dinary delicacy, exceeding that of marrow and fatness in any other Creature I know of, this flesh of Fish unites both Sea and Land in one, it partakes of neither so much as to offend the Palate, and wants of nothing that excels in either, the Flesh is truly so∣lid but easy of digestion, like Fish in the last, but as flesh in the first, neither the lean nor the fat of a fishy taste, but both as pleasant as nourishing, and as nourish∣ing as pleasant, and therefore in the whole a complete restaurative food: as it is a shell Fish it may well pretend thereto, and as its flesh is most like the white tender veal, it may make good the pretence, hence its broths, when boyled excels whatsoever, transcending the very Jellies of the curious: when the Callapee (for such is called the belly part) is baked, it vies with Venison, and lacks only scarcity to make it better, for judgement as well as palate will extort as much from me.
<PB N="62" REF="40"/>Judgement, I mean directed from the na∣ture of this Creature, which certainly is extraordinary in Generation, Formation, Life, and Death, all which being remark∣able, I must not omit either to defend my judgement. As for the generation of the Turtle, it's almost past the creed of any to allow, without most undeniable sense con∣vince: for the amorous embraces of the Male and Female Turtles continue not Minutes, not Hours, not Daies; but the very circuit of a Moon, an old Aegyptian year compleat, their coitions, wherein they live on seminal expences without any other restaurative than water, is that, which would bankrupt the creation to imitate throughout. But then the poor prodigal, like the emblematick figures in <HI>Fullers</HI> holy War, as he went on full, he returns emp∣ty, and requires eleven months recruit to visit his Uncle, while the she plumps with the swelling of her impregnated Ovary, and being richly laden seeks the proper discharge of her increasing Treasury, mix∣ing it, like that of natural dust Gold with the warm hatching sand, which puts off its sterility by extraordinary plentiful brood of young Turtle, who by strange instinct knowing their watery mansion, hast thi∣ther,
<PB N="63" REF="40"/>from their now unprofitable nest: But that not without a numerous atten∣dance of preying Fowl, who savouring their delicacy, endevour to intercept them in their passage, which they fail not to do of some, while the other escape into the more proper Element, encreasing the stock of Turtle for the more constant furnishing the table of the deliciously feasting <HI>Jamaica</HI> Man, where I must not yet leave the Tur∣tle, till I further remark his neer approxi∣mation to reason, as well as his prodigious fulness of vital energy, both evidently in∣sinuated by the signal property of weeping. And here me thinks I cannot but bear a part with the mournful Turtle, and almost cry for company, while I behold her lying on her back (for that posture is their pri∣son) fetching deep melting sighs, and pro∣fusely emitting Tears from her languish∣ing eyes, litterally fulfilling <HI>the creation groans for the hoped for liberty.</HI> Neither can so great passions appear without great sense, which certainly this creature per∣takes of at a prodigious rate, and truly testifies the same from his heart, for even that hath vital motion five or six hours af∣ter its separation. The ignorant, to make it more strange, assign the Turtle three
<PB N="64" REF="41"/>hearts: But to undeceive, it's one Heart with two large Auricles, neither yet is the whole Turtle unsutable to his heart in retaining vital motion, it hath even grie∣ved me to see the Calapee many hours af∣ter its separation from head, heart, and other parts, after its cutting, salting, and peppering, sensibly move under the fiery trial of the Oven. My pen would refuse disclosing this necessary cruelty, did it not strangely testify the great vitality of this creature, and consequently the advantage the feeders thereon may well expect from converting it into themselves: Much more might be said concerning this nourishment, but yet the large shoal of various Fish re∣quire some place in our paper. The Ma∣natee or sea Cow must not be forgotten, though she more seldome visit us, to re∣minde of her worth, yet when she doth she brings a feast with her as well as a good medicine for the afflicting Stone. Our English name of Cow doth much be∣fit, for her nose and head most imitate the same; her pasture not fish, but grass of the sea or banks, with which the Bays and Creaks being well supplied, draw these creatures for their food sake to be taken: the Manatee hath yet somewhat remarka∣ble,
<PB N="65" REF="41"/>for she doth not spawn as fish nor cast forth her Egs as Turtle, but calves her young and suckles them from an ud∣der with milk, the better to make good the name of Cow: our dairy wives are not yet so curious to experiment their Butter, and I fear never will, those Cows being scarce to be herded. The Jew fish crowds to be one of the first three of our most wor∣thy Fish, and deserves by no means to be excluded, affording a most firm well re∣lished flesh throughout his whole bulk, but a most eminently delicious head compa∣ring with the curious Cods; his fat eyes and brains exercise the palate with an unu∣sual taste of a most singular marrow, the whole skin is well moistned with such fat, and renders it most nourishing and restau∣rative, without the usual hazard of surfeit∣ing entailed thereon: It never affecting the stomach fulsomely, but disolves into spermatick nourishment readily, our <HI>Botargo</HI> Treasurer. The choice Mullet brings up the next division crowded with various Snappers, Rock fish, Stone bass, Cavallies, Groopers, Jacks, Grunts, Por∣goes, old Wives, Tarpums, Spanish Mac∣keril, Barrocoota, Gar fish, Grash fish, Mud fish, Cat fish, Silver fish, Pilchers,
<PB N="66" REF="42"/>Sprat, Drummers, Parret fish, Dolphins, Place, Flounders, Bonetoes, Thornback, Stingraies, Murraies, Lobsters, Craw∣fish, Shrimps, sea Crabs, Eels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with many others not yet named, though daily baptized in their own Element, or not re∣membred in so great a crowd: And now from so great a store it is no miracle that some thousands are daily fed on Port-Roy∣al especially, as also else where neer the margin of this Island throughout. And moreover, which ought most thankfully to be remarked, as the Land of <HI>Jamaica</HI> scarce harbours any venomous troublers of our secure living, as the main Land throughout the <HI>Indies</HI> doth, so neither doth our neigh∣bouring Seas or Rivers serve us with any poysoning Fish, as are found elsewhere a∣bout the <HI>Bahama</HI> Island &amp; other parts, where its frequent to be strangely affected and meerly poisoned by eating some sort of fish and others at sometimes: Of which I have seen two Barmudians strangely and hazardously afflicted, but recovered by ta∣king Orveitan. But <HI>Jamaica</HI> hath no fear from her more benign fish, wherefore we may boldly serve our selves from so great variety; the care remains, to restrain the appetite, better to preserve it quick and
<PB N="67" REF="42"/>throughly digesting, whereby the Sto∣mach may greedily crave the afternoon Chocalata, and so easily imploying na∣ture to a gradual full supply, chiefly to be compleated at the greater meal about se∣ven of the Clock, where our Muttons, Veals, Lambs, Kids, variously ordered, may satiate our strongest dint of appetite, whereto adding our dunghil Fowl at choice, and wild Fowl, such as Ducks of diverse kinds, Teal, Plover, Snipes, Pi∣geons of various sorts, Turtle Doves, ground Doves, Parrats, Parreketoes, clucking Hens, Guinny Hens, Curlews, and if the Roman luxury were on foot, the Flemmin∣gos Tongues, all which may sufficiently replenish and gratify our supping <HI>Jamai∣ca</HI> Man, who, if at any time, may now take liberty to satiate nature but never over burthen her, but so that the daily and nights discharge may be well supplied without intrenching upon the main stock, which ought carefully to be handled, from one day to the other, and improved rather than lessened, so that he may without damage sometimes shift his thick blood by emissions, to the bettering of the whole mass, and fundamentally securing life and health. For it is plain matter of fact, that
<PB N="68" REF="43"/>they to whom such shiftings of the Tyri∣an dye Juice is natural, even they live-longest in <HI>Jamaica</HI> and freest from inter∣ruptions of their health by intempera∣tures and diseases; unto the consideration of which it is now time to descend in our next Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 5. <HI>Of the Intemperatures and Dis∣eases</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS for Diseases usually found heret, hey are far short of the long Beadrowl which infest our native Country: No small Pox or very rarely, saving sometimes brought from <HI>Guinny</HI> by Negroes, terrify or remark us; no Scurvy that almost uni∣versal contagion of our native Country is got here, or continued if brought; no de∣populating Plague that ere I have heard of in the West <HI>Indies;</HI> Consumptions nothing
<PB N="69" REF="43"/>so frequent, and when, never so piningly tedious. As for Venereal Affects their symp∣toms are all lesned, and their discharge more easy far than in colder climes: The chief danger lying in the too often neglect, and slighting the small Enemy, from whence the wise know how to take heed; the affrighting Stone is a great stranger here, forasmuch as hopped Beer and French Wines are so likewise; the Green Sickness and accumulated evils flowing thence, the benign female moon in her direct approxi∣mation rescues that whole sex remarkably from, as well as assists and facilitates births: So that scarcely is there room left for the old cry <HI>(Lucina fer opem)</HI> Births proving as brisk as all other Produces in the <HI>Indies</HI> do. But why should I thus mul∣tiply our happy negation or absences of affli∣cting evils, but the better to excite the thank∣ful acknowledgement of Divine Good∣ness in such deliverances, and that with so much the more courage and contented∣ness we may sustain the maladies incident to us here when infflicted on us: for it is never to be thought that humane frailty may be excluded from any place since the loss of Paradise, and it is proverbially re∣diculous to dream of that of the Fools:
<PB N="70" REF="44"/><HI>Jamaica</HI> therefore as part of the <HI>Indies</HI> hath its endemical evils, and of such we are here to consider as well as of the general frailty of humane life, whereby our Houses of Clay, where ere they are seated, daily moulder into the dust, administring consi∣deration to the prudence of the pensive man, and scarcely to be declined by any such: Especially since the Ancients have well calculated the contemplation of death to be the beginning of wisdome. For no one can rightly dole away his time or sup∣ply it with actions agreeable to wisdome, but whoso reckons upon his small duration; neither can any one, who hath rightly cal∣culated, be surprized with the terror of his <HI>exit:</HI> Let's therefore that we may be pre∣pared for the worst, consider the number of our Enemies, their Nature, their man∣ner of assault, with the reasons of all, in order to obviate or prevent, or else cure and relieve from, or lastly manfully to com∣ply with the necessity of Fate when no∣thing else shall remain. As for the num∣ber of morbifick affections usually and chiefly infesting <HI>Jamaica,</HI> they are but few, and may well be reduced to the heads following, of which distinctly though with brevity sutable to each ones apprehension
<PB N="71" REF="44"/>and easy provision, it being my design not to multiply things far sought and dear bought, but to serve our selves as far as possible with easy and ready Remedies and those few, in imitation of my most wise and most honest Master <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> not com∣plying with the corruption of his degene∣rated successors, who have sacrificed the honour of the noble science to base lucre, and have accordingly succeeded.</P>
<P>The first indisposition that usually meets the new Comer, is a <HI>Diarrhaea</HI> or Flux, a friendly rather than injurious motion of Na∣ture, caused either by a new sort of Drink &amp; Diet, which falls out in most places more or less, the which ceaseth without preju∣dice or any other remedy than a little time; or else the same may arise from rejoycing intemperance, too often welcoming the new arrivers, and may be accompanied with an ebullition of the fermented Juices boyling over to a convenient discharge of nature, the which by due abstinence may likewise cease: but if the same chance to stir up excrementitious accomplices and blend them with the blood, it may well hurry the whole into a chafing fret, marching the blood into the outrage of a febrifick Rant, if not discharged by the <HI>Crisis</HI> of a plentiful sweat,
<PB N="72" REF="45"/>which is the usual prevention as well as the natural termination of distempers pro∣per to the warm place, and hitherto na∣ture is the sole Physician and ever after∣wards the truest Indicator to the sagacious, what ought to be done: but while she la∣bours sometimes in vain, sometimes in an excited rage, she is gently to be reduced and assisted in her first regular motion by the artificial attendant, thus if the Flux con∣tinue, it indicates somewhat to be dischar∣ged as well as nature to be quieted and hushed into a repose, lest she spend her strength in vain and then expire for want of the same, which sometimes happen: Let therefore the Patient to answer the first intention, take a sutable quantity of Man∣na (for Manna is the most natural, most agreeable purge here of any) dissolve of the same ℥jss or ℥ij, in a pint of Posset drink or other vehicle; after discharge thereby, at night let him take fifteen grains of torrefied Rhubarb in a poached Egg, repeat the like Rhubarb the next morning and as much at night in a <HI>Bolus</HI> of <HI>Dias∣cordium,</HI> or if need be, before the same inject a Clyster of broth and <HI>Diascordium,</HI> to the intention of the observer; if heat en∣crease by this method, as sometimes it may
<PB N="73" REF="45"/>happen, it indicates bleeding necessary, and the blood will prove very thick, and always and in all cases plentifully to be withdrawn; forasmuch as the Patient is less fainted thereby, the blood afterwards mo∣ving more briskly and giving less pressure to the Chest. If so be the first two inten∣tions, <HI>viz.</HI> the discharge of peccant mat∣ter and quiet of enraged nature are not pro∣perly and timely conciliated, further pro∣gress of the Enemy requires further inten∣tions of the Physician; for nature strug∣gles at length unto blood, and here the in∣tentions may be quite contrary, directed from quite contrary causes, but both meet if well managed, at the same end: Thus two in a circle though they turn back to back and walk one from the other, may meet face to face at the same point, the Dysentery or bloody Flux (for thereof we are now to treat) may proceed either from a colliquation of humours, where all of them, through great heat either of mind extreamly agitating or of the body resol∣ving through extraordinary ferments, be∣come extravagantly thin and eager, boun∣cing through the tender restraint of the vessels into an open flood; or else the same may be effected through a sluggish thick∣ness
<PB N="74" REF="46"/>of blood, whereby being too gross for our quick circulation, and forced by the sure intending motion, it breaks the due re∣straint of the vessels, and floods out by indi∣rect waies, so much as by great loss to threaten danger, from both we may have the bloody Flux: Which ought to be cu∣red by contrary means, <HI>viz.</HI> by reducing the blood to a due thickness in the first case and by rendring it more thin in the se∣cond. Whoso daringly or ignorantly runs through thick and thin at the same rate, u∣sing means to one or the other alike, must necessarily run a notorious risk, or else hath more luck than good cunning. As for the Case wherein the blood is too thin and ea∣ger, I shall need keep no Crowd of Reme∣dies to confuse the chooser, but prescribe what nature freely offers in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and that is <HI>China</HI> Root, whereof being some∣what dryed and then grated into powder separated in a Searce, let him take a scru∣ple, or as much as may ly on the point of a broad knife twice, for a Dose, let the same be taken in bed, and repeat the same if need be every six hours: And the blood and Juices thereby sweetned cease from their indirect irruptions. In the other case where the blood is thick let the Patient
<PB N="75" REF="46"/>bleed and drink copiously of Ptisan or Bar∣ly Water, till the symptoms cease by such a dilating course, and if the blood being thinned chance to be rendred sharp, and effect the Dysentery from a new cause, as sometimes it may be: Then take of Chi∣na as before. To the which I shall add no more nor design any further, till I shall ob∣serve this fail. The white Flux as also the vain irritations of Nature called the needy, whereto oft provocations urge and give considerable disturbances, they are conci∣liated by the same Remedy; and what is signably remarkable, no inconvenience of weakness or heat ensues such a stoppage, but sensibly strength springs thence as from a most proper restaurative, wherefore we may well pass from our Chapter of Fluxes to the next of Fevers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 6. <HI>Of the Fevers in</HI> Jamaica.</HEAD>
<P>A Fever being the general door through which most in all places take their <HI>exit</HI> of this world, and the difference of Fe∣vers affording a great variety thereof, hath imployed in all ages and places diffe∣rent attempts of Remedy, for so univer∣sal a grievance, or at least of discourse to∣wards so desirable an end. That I may not be wanting to common custome, or more especially in any good wishes and endea∣vours to obviate so common an Enemy, I'll subjoin the best of my thoughts with my successes and observations as well of the nature as cure of those conflagrations in humane Body, called Fevers. A Fever is a word of a Roman extract derived from the same Root as cause of its deno∣mination, with the moneth styled <HI>Februa∣ry,</HI> wherein the Ancients using their ex∣purgatory fires for expiating the lapsed, as well as for a further preparation for the
<PB N="77" REF="47"/>new years future benefit, both in form and intention design the same for the publick Weal, that Nature in each individual intends for humane preservation by the conflagrati∣on in humane body termed Fevers: The <HI>ge∣nus</HI> of which affects common to each spe∣cies or kind of Fevers, is a non-natural heat, wherein all agree, of which there∣fore somewhat ought to be said. By non-natural is meant something necessary to the preservation of nature in her delin∣quent condition, though extraneous there∣to and not of the nature thereof, and there∣fore called non-natural. Thus the Air, Eat∣ing and Drinking, Evacuations and Reten∣tions, Labour and Rest, the Passions of the mind and Propagation of the species are called commonly the six non-naturals: Though congenial to and flowing from na∣ture yet being extraneous from the phy∣sical Being of a man (for a man is none of those) they have hitherto been allowed the term of non-naturals: Thus a Fever is a heat non-natural, though it be nothing else than an heating strugling endeavour of nature her self to remove some grie∣vance: Yet as this heat is more than na∣ture requires for her daily management of her functions of life, such heat may be
<PB N="78" REF="48"/>termed non-natural: it is not contranatu∣ral, though nature thereby is sometimes o∣verthrown and dissolved, nor yet preter∣natural, for it is not beside but with the intention of nature, nor yet natural, because nature in her integrity needs it not, but therefore non-natural, a Fever is a non-natural heat. Heat seems the active prin∣ciple of the Universe, from which both par∣ticular and general motions are begun, or at least continued. The World is quick∣ned by the central heat of the Sun, and the whole jollily dance about their warming Fire, to the solemn natural praises of the great Recidenciary, life beams it self thence: For <HI>in him we live, move and have our being;</HI> the continuance of his Efflux maintains us in life, our <HI>Calidum nativum,</HI> or sacred Vestal Fire being fed thereby daily, and sometimes is surfeited thereof by an inflaming disproportion, whereby our temperament not only <HI>ad Pondus,</HI> but that <HI>ad Justitiam</HI> is fractured into mor∣bifick Affects. Thus nature is enraged often by our abode too long in the Sun, and excites our <HI>Ephemeris,</HI> or the Fever of a daies time: For which there's no need of a Cure, the very nature of such a Fever terminating it self, if we substract the Pa∣tient
<PB N="79" REF="48"/>from the inflammatory cause. The first heat of nature in humane frame pre∣paratory to the continuation of all her de∣pending motions, is the digestive heat for chylification in the Stomach, from the cor∣ruption or exasperating of which either from the sower ferments, or too much of the overflowing Gall, most Fevers are either continued or begun. Hence it hath been a common usage as well as successful to ac∣cost our Fevers at first with Emericks or Vomits, either sometimes to remove the sole cause of the feverish Intemperature (and the effect likewise causeth this sole Re∣medy) or else timely to substract occasional succours of additional heat, which though begun elsewhere would much be aggrava∣ted by vitiating Juices brought or found in this first elaboratory of decocting nature. Therefore such evacuation by vomiting ne∣ver ought to be neglected by the careful attender, provided such be duly timed and proportionated both to the circumstances within and without, which being materi∣al may crowd themselves into our present remarks. As first where eminent signs of a <HI>Plethora</HI> or great fulness of blood exhi∣bit themselves, then these cleansings by vomitings must give the first place to eva∣cuation
<PB N="80" REF="49"/>by blood letting, lest the full ves∣sels being too much urged by the contra∣natural motion of the Stomach in vomi∣ting, suffocate at once; or else may be for∣ced to an eruption in the more tender and fine parts, such as the Eyes, Lungs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> laying the unhappy foundation for an <HI>Empyeron</HI> in the first, or divers lasting, weaknesses in the latter. Wherefore eva∣cuation by blood letting ought in such ca∣ses to preceed these from Emeticks. More∣over the sex is to be considered, the Female not wanting so much the evacuations, by bleeding especially, nor that by vomiting so generally, both which are almost ne∣cessary to the other sex, under the first irre∣gular ferment, or non-natural heat in the Stomach, nature providing better for the one than the other Sex by her great dif∣charges of turgent humours: besides the great commotions caused from wind in E∣meticks or opening of a Vein, may in the Female prevent or corrupt natures own intentions, and raise the Devil of vapours not so soon laid again. Wherefore adver∣tency is to be had, and that more cautious, concerning the more tender Sex sutable to their Nature, Time, Age and other cir∣cumstances. And now having thus added
<PB N="81" REF="49"/>the necessary cautions not to be forgotten in our most general evacuations, we may more securely proceed thereto, and so much the rather, because malignity, of which there's great noise and solicitude in other parts of the World, hath no place here ori∣ginally at least in Fevers, but sometimes added thereunto by the management of the attendant or Patient, who for want of discharge proper and timely of turgent hu∣mours; but exasperating such by an inflam∣matory usage, they may become little less, if not somewhat malignant. But our Air in <HI>Jamaica</HI> (of which oft refreshed the Pa∣tient ought partake) is our general external preservative from pestilential and malig∣nant Fevers, wherefore I insist on the two general Remedies of bleeding and vomi∣ting, as the most proper for our <HI>Jamaica</HI> Practicer, and most safe if duly timed. I know it hath been commonly received that about eight years since when the victori∣ous Fleet returned from the signal <HI>Panama</HI> expedition, that then they brought with them an high if not pestilential Fever, of which many dyed throughout the Coun∣try: But this being a forreign distemper brought from abroad, the causes of which I could not so well judge, I am not as yet forced
<PB N="82" REF="50"/>from my opinion thereby, but conclude <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> more happy than to be annoyed there∣with directly and originally, I confess if our Patient be not timely and sufficiently bled, and death ensue, spots from the thick blood stagnating appear: but that not from a ma∣lignant cause but fulness, for bleeding and cooling well timed, and thinning medica∣ments prove succesful; for the symptoms of malignity, such as great oppressions at heart, Fainting, cold Sweats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are here acted from the usual thickness of the Blood, for the blood being thick and when by a feverish ferment whipped about with a brisk motion sutable to the moving causes, the thickned Juices not without difficulty pass the many straits of the Body, and sometimes stagnating by a plaging force of the actuated blood sud∣denly kill, whereas when blood is duly withdrawn ere the ferment rise too high, and is so managed till it cease again, the symptoms of malignity either not appear or else are soon removed, relief always ensu∣ing such evacuation if rightly timed: wherefore if the Practitioner be not igno∣rantly malignant there's no cause of terror in our <HI>Jamaica</HI> Fevers: But the two imita∣ting evacuations being established, we may descend to the particulars of our non-natu∣ral
<PB N="83" REF="50"/>heat, and begin from the intemperature in the first decoction of nature in the Sto∣mach, which seeing it quickly draws its neighbours into association, the fermenta∣tion is easily propagated further, or else soon ceaseth here by the sole Remedy of a Vomit; but if not, this first evacuation sets us but the further in our direct way of obviating a greater Enemy: therefore scarce ever with safety ought it to be neg∣lected or retarded. It's usual that the too sower ferment of the Stomach vellicates and thereby contracts that part, so that the neighbouring assage of the Gall called the Coleduct is moved upwards likewise, and from such motion the ductile Gall follows till it ascend the Stomach, from whence the former heat is aggravated and gives a sickness in that part, irritations to vomit, and pains in the head. Wherefore the former method of cure continues proper: however one emetick is not sometimes sufficient to discharge the <HI>Cystis fellea,</HI> the nest of this flowing fer∣ment; but such filling again, and overflow∣ing as before, renew the feverish heat, hence most reasonably our usual Fevers are intermittent. Of the which since our discourse is now in their chief seat, and
<PB N="84" REF="51"/>such Fevers are the most frequent Ene∣mies that annoy us, I must more particu∣larly insist thereon, and shew that <HI>Jamai∣ca</HI> is as kind in a sufficient Remedy, as lia∣ble to this frequent intemperature. Five or six of our Fevers are of this kind and com∣monly called the every other daies Fever and Ague, which oftentimes is interrup∣ted by medicaments or Methods, but if let alone, the management of nature proves no other than a safe Tertian, to the which the Natives are safely liable, it rarely killing any of them without the help of an irregular management. The great frequencies of these Agues may have two causes, the one the great quantity of Choler abounding here, the other a stop of the usual necessary discharge of such fermenting humour. The Choler abounds between the Tropicks is but reasonable as well as matter of fast for the inflaming Sun must needs kind its like in its neerest subjects, and propaga<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> from the great fountain of heat the like inhu¦mane Body: of which the Gall as central re∣ceiver in the lower Belly, ebs and flows ac∣cording to the communications of the su¦preme dispenser of heat and motion.

<PB N="85" REF="51"/>for the first motions towards a superior life in the delineations of the <HI>foetus</HI> first, and there∣in becomes though the lowest, yet the first tendency to humane life, which must deign to have the same with the plants, and inferi∣or Beings, ere it ascend to a more perfect∣ed life consummated in the intelligent and rational creature, which though it towrs so high at length, yet hath but the small beginning of a fermentative motion emi∣nently seated in the Center of the over∣shadowing and preparing Liver, if not of the lower orb of the Belly: whereof the Navel being the Pole, guides us directly to this first central fermenting heat, treasu∣red in the <HI>Cystis fellea</HI> where the yolked fire derived from the maternal Stock by the umbilical vessel kitchins her self for the service of the whole new to be raised structure of the anon to be hatched <HI>foetus.</HI></P>
<P>From the which Choler seeing evident necessary fermentations have their begin∣nings, we shall likewise observe that the non-natural heat of a Tertian springs thence likewise, and our eyes must witness hereto, while we see the bilious ejections which do naturally arise or reasonably are enfor∣ced by vomitings, under such affects; which when but removed or contemperated, the
<PB N="86" REF="52"/>severish heat and bilious fermentations cease, wherefore herein lies the proper cure of those Tertians or the every other daies Ague or Fever. To compleat which and render the returns of the fit more rea∣sonable and apparent, we must add the constipation of the skin or the shutting the Pores caused either from external sudden cold, or internal rage of allarmed Na∣ture, who while assembled relieves inward, leaving the outgard of the porous skin more shut because more cold, and less of the retiring heat remaining there. Thus the usual ports of the skin denying passage to the constant profuse discharge in those hot Countries, absolutely necessary, by the habit of the Body; the same condense and thence become sower, then chill the ex∣tream parts, and cause the shaking or cold fit, enough to awaken nature to a relief and cause whatso follows in the hot com∣bate or strugle in the casting forth the di∣sturbing forreigner, wherein the infla∣ming ferment of choler having its chief part to act, exasperates the heat too high, till it threaten the conflagration of the whole and the attending symptoms neces∣sary thereto, in which rage to add good inflaming Cordials, is to make nature de∣sperate
<PB N="87" REF="52"/>and thereby sometimes to work extraordinary for her relief, but more of∣ten becomes a sacrifice to the mistake and folly of the flattering administer, who comforts himself and the paying friends of the deceased, that he had the richest Cor∣dials imaginable: thus men pay for their mischiefs and love to have it so be, because they know no better. Whereas nature will never be forced but led, and her tru∣est Secretary and neer Counseller, the great <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> who saved more lives than any one ere since, knew nothing of these inflammatory Medicaments. The cor∣ruption of simplicity and confused igno∣rance hath raised these Spirits since to car∣ry the afflicted more speedily in fiery Chariots, God knows where: for my part I never add coals to the fire, but re∣move the fewel, and calm nature to a com∣pose and regular discharge of the morbi∣fick matter, without straining her or run∣ning unnecessary risks. For my great Ma∣ster tells me, Nature is the curer of all her diseases, the Physitian is but the observing Minister to suggest her necessaries and re∣move impediments, the which now re∣mains, and that therein I manifest the same simplicity that nature delights in, and
<PB N="88" REF="53"/>thereby is relieved, as whoso tries will find the benefit of easie relief and safety, in the attempt thereto complying with the three happy adverbs of the divine <HI>Hippo∣crates, viz.</HI> that the Physician ought to cure <HI>quickly, safely,</HI> and <HI>pleasantly;</HI> without demurrs, to magnifie the cure and inflame the Reckonings; without happy-be-lucky ventures, where mans life lies at pawn; or torturing nauseousness, to add affliction to the afflicted. Wherefore since the intenti∣on of our present Fever, and it may be of most others, is the discharge of the first tur∣gent monitor from the Stomach, and adja∣cent parts by vomiting as is said before and the contemperating of the incited or enra∣ged non-natural Heat; let the Patient upon the discovery of the assaulting Ene∣my watch a Pacate, and timely three hours before his Fit take either of the vomiting Wine, which is no other than <HI>Crocus Me∣tallorum</HI> powdered (the quantity where∣of matters little) suppose half an ounce more or less in one quart of Wine, set the same in a Skillet or Pot of warm water, wherein let it stand two hours, then remove the same infusion and keep for use, pouring off the same cleer when occasion offers, whereof one ounce, or half as much more may
<PB N="89" REF="53"/>serve for a Dose, or if this easie Remedy be wanting (which ought not to be in a Plantation) let him take from five to nine of our vomitive Nuts, which agree well in all flegmatick temperaments, or of our Sea Onions whereof is plenty here, pre∣pared by Vinegar for the use above. By the which cleansing the Guts and Stomach, ere the access of the feverish assault, a fit season is prepared for our most general of a vegetable (if not of all others) sudorifick or febrifuge Sweater, which the benign <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> affords most plentifully and ready at hand, <HI>viz.</HI> China Root, take and grate the same when first dry, searce the fine powder thereof, and thereof take about ℥j, or the quantity that two points of a broad knife will take up, there's no pre∣judice as ere I found in the access of so be∣nign a simple compose in Bed to a swear, which soon without exasperating heat or force ensues, and if need be more plenti∣ful to discharge by sweating, repeat the like three hours after, adding for a better sup∣ply of inoffensive and agreeable moisture of the Decoction, for which of the same Root may be taken about ℥iij, sliced into two quarts of water being boyled as we usually do Tea. To afford after half an
<PB N="90" REF="54"/>hours decoction an agreeable Tincture of of the said China, the which when poured on Sugar to a grateful sweetness, or with∣out that sweet addition, makes a most rea∣dy and proper drink for the thirsting Swea∣ter, whereof the Patient may drink most freely to discharge more plentifully and without faintness by sweating, and at any other times if he fear by previous symp∣toms a returning Fit, let him always at such notices betake to his Bed, and take of the powder as before with the same drink, and by Gods usual help I have hi∣therto seen and felt the desired successes. Wherefore there needs no further care for elaborated Medicaments and Methods, <HI>Frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pau∣ciora,</HI> neither need I add the rational where matter of fact approves its self: only to sa∣tisfie the inquirer, I must say our Root sweetens as I suppose the enraged ferment either of the Stomach or Gall: Thence Nature being pacate easily flings out by sweat the disposed morbifick matter, sets o∣pen the dores for the fugitives, and thereby answers the true intentions in feverish ebul∣litions, which being come to an hap∣py end of designing Nature, cease by so simple so easie a Remedy, thus the grea∣ter
<PB N="91" REF="54"/>half of our Patients in <HI>Jamaica</HI> may be provided for without trouble, cost or nau∣seousness. And moreover this happy Re∣medy answers not only the Indications of a Tertian, but of a continued, nay of the most obstinate quartane Fever also. But I need not distinguish of Fevers or at least pursue such distinctions with distinct Cures, for though I have not experienced as yet in Quartans as much as in Tertians, nor ever may; yet so much as I have, which hath been in some and in all I have met with since my happy usage of China, as above, I have found the safe discharge both of Continued and Quartans by the same Simple: therefore I shall conclude though empirically yet beneficially for the Pub∣lick, for the which I write, and not further multiply under this Head, but refer the users to the abovesaid, who may be content with no further trouble. For to confess the truth where ere the Practicer heaps a multiplicity of Remedies, it declares his own suspicion of the desired effect, and ig∣norance what will answer his intention, or insufficiency in what he uses or else a mer∣cenary compliance with custom. Wherefore as Nature is the infallible curer of every distemper, and she by how much the more
<PB N="92" REF="55"/>simple, the less must be opposite and quer∣relsome: Whatso of Remedy comes neer∣est to nature must needs be most proper and less liable to hazards (and it is no little vertue among the crowd of Practicioners to do no hurt) therefore most natural re∣medies seem first to be desired as most safe, most pleasant and benign, such as our a∣greeable China, so then we need not won∣der, this Root among the wise Chineses, from whence it took its name, hath been in great esteem and valued at a good price, though when it's transported thence it scarce answers its so great fame; for to make it the better transportable, they be∣reave it much of its virtue, and serve us in <HI>Europe</HI> with little better than rotten wood. Whence of late its price hath sunk with its demand, whereas in <HI>Jamaica</HI> this happy Root being repleat with its salutiferous Tincture, which gives its weight and in∣trinsick worth, outdoes its common fame and any vegetable that ere I have met with, nay what the cracking Chymist brags of his <HI>Elixir,</HI> this while in its vigour, truly performs. But whether in the northern Climes it may answer what it performs in its native place, where the Pores are o∣penly disposed to sweats, I cannot assert,
<PB N="93" REF="55"/>but judge it worth probation, and wish its success there as I have found it here.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 7. <HI>Of the Dropsie called the Coun∣try Disease.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I having after my manner dispatched the discourse and cure of the Fevers in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> come to the next ensuing epi∣demick, called the Dropsie or Country Dis∣ease, to which many Servants and neglect∣ed persons especially are obnoxious, and for want of timely assistances come short home, for their sakes therefore as well as their masters, I shall omit nothing healing∣ly to obviate so common an enemy, ren∣dring it both easie and cheap through the overflowing bounty of the great healer of us all, who hath given a balm for every Sore, and that not to be far sought and dear bought, but neer at hand, were our
<PB N="94" REF="56"/>eyes opened like <HI>Hagars</HI> to see the thirsted for Remedy. A Dropsie is a disease hath made a great noise in the contending par∣ties, an argument of its being less known, nay <HI>Helmont</HI> is so bold as to tax the whole Schools with the ignorance thereof, and al∣though he was happy in a Remedy to cure the same, which is the the true end of the knowledge of a Disease; yet with his good leave, he himself might perhaps run into as unlike conjectures about the causes as those he severely reproves. The Schools have assigned three sorts of Drop∣sies, <HI>viz.</HI> an <HI>Anasarca, Ascitis</HI> and the Tym∣pany. The first is water betwixt the skin and that generally throughout the Body and neer the same with a <HI>Leuco-Plegmatia,</HI> the second named <HI>Ascitis</HI> being the most proper Dropsie as appearing in Belly and Legs, the third is called Tympany from the great Tension of the skin like to a Drum, the most rare though the most cru∣el and afflictive, all which seem little less than distinction of degrees of one and the same disease, or at least I will take leave to suppose them so, having reason there∣fore in my cure thereof. <HI>Helmont</HI> will by no means allow the Schools to be just in taking the Liver as the chief part male af∣fected
<PB N="95" REF="56"/>in these distempers, and indeed not without great shew of good reason, for I thought with my self, saies he, to what end hath there been Anatomy in the World for two thousand years, if there be not in this day a more succesful cure of the Dropsie than in times past, for wherefore are we the Butchers of dead Carcases, if we do not learn thereby the errors of the Antient. The same Author therefore having inspect∣ed the many Carcases of dropsical persons, of whom he makes distinct mention, asserts the Livers of them all all no way vitiated, and therefore concludes the Liver faultless in dropsical Affects, of which I am further satisfied by the nature of the Cure of such distempers, of which anon: However I can neither allow the opinion of the more happy <HI>Helmont</HI> concerning his hard word <HI>Latex,</HI> and the wrothful Governour there∣of, the Kidneys, whence in short he de∣rives the cause of a Dropsie, the which for want of my well understanding I be∣take my self to a more evident description thereof agreeable to its frequency in the hottest <HI>Indies,</HI> premising the usual times of our Dropsies to be after Fluxes, Fe∣vers and other disturbances, whereby the discharge through the habit of the body is
<PB N="96" REF="57"/>lesned and interrupted, hence whats usu∣ally carried off by sweating and a more si∣lent daily breathing through the whole skin, rebounds inwards thence condense in∣to an ichorous Water, thence aggravates more and more the first cause through en∣creased weaknesses and hindrances of the necessary transpiration, the which accor∣ding to the <HI>Statica Medicina</HI> is demonstra∣ted to be very considerable, it being some pounds weight. And when that in part or in whole shall be retained, some time, such as the Dropsies usually take to come to their height, may well accumulate the greatest quantities of Water treasured up for the destruction of the Patient, that ere we may have seen or heard of, not but that such stagnating Waters in time may work further alterations likewise on the subjected parts and <HI>Viscera,</HI> the which then to see effected, may afford no won∣der, nor yet insinuate the reason of the first Waters from the weakness of the Liver, Reins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as usually is taught and recei∣ved for a truth, but rather from a more evident cause, <HI>viz.</HI> the constipation of the porous Skin impeding transpirations and more copious sweatings, according whereto I institute the reason of the Cure
<PB N="97" REF="57"/>of Dropsies, which matter of fact hath e∣vinced to me from bare external unctions, although from greater security to the cure, I add or rather premise a Vomit of <HI>Mercurius vitae</HI> or of our physick Nuts, but oft cure without and perhaps as well, the unction sufficiently answering the intention of this Disease of the Dropsie.</P>
<P>There grows almost every where in moist and boggish places, a large and re∣markable plant called generally the dumb Cane, and that not improperly. For it similates in its large and high joynted Stalk that of a Sugar Cane, and scarce of it self without its leaf by the eye to be di∣stinguished there from, though it gives a deeper verdure than usually the sweet Cane doth, and besides the leaf of this is much other than the flag of the Sugar Cane, most representing a water Plantain leaf though much longer. The Epithet of dumb is re∣markably added thereto, for as much as whoso toucheth it with his Tongue be∣comes dumb and unable to speak for two or three hours: But then without any prejudice the part returns to its former use and volubility. Therefore it appears to be no poyson, however I administer it not in∣wardly as yet, but content my self with
<PB N="98" REF="58"/>the sufficient outward application in the manner following.</P>
<P>I take of the juicy Cane, and beat it in a mortar into a kind of a Past, then add thereto a double quantity of Hogs Grease or rather Turtle Fat or Snakes fat, the which having agitated strongly together, I suffer it to rest some daies, then beat it well again and keep for use. Observing that the longer it be kept it better answers our intention. But then it must be heated in the Mortar ever and anon, and well bea∣ten, lest it vivify into worms, further to pre∣vent which, as also to render the Oynt∣ment more fine, safe and agreeable: Take of the Mass beaten in the fats as before and well heated; then strein the same through a course strong Towel forcibly, which boil up to due consistency and keep for use, which is thus.</P>
<P>Take of this Ointment and chafe it warm into the swollen parts, and if need be apply the former gross Unguent or mix∣ture by way of a Cataplasm to the <HI>Scrotum,</HI> which part usually bears a great share of the Disease. Such effect hath this Oyntment on the Patient as to discharge the watery Tumour through the skin, which though <HI>Helmont</HI> would fain have carried another
<PB N="99" REF="58"/>way; yet seems better, if possible which he questions, through the habit of the Bo∣dy: Such a like discharge the Herb Ver∣bene, of which great store is to be found in <HI>Jamaica</HI> as well as elsewhere, effecteth on the stagnating blood in the Pleurify. For apply a Cataplasm of that Plant warm to the side affected and it relieves from that grievance through a discharge by the skin, of the afflicting blood; the remarks where∣of appear on the Cataplasm when removed, wherefore when Nature can and doth dis∣charge the neerest way, what need we go fur∣ther about. The reason why and how this dumb Cane affects the Tongue, may be the same for its desired way of discharging by the Pores to the curing of the Dropsie, for that which renders the Tongue as be∣foresaid upon the touch of the dumb Cane, is its power of drawing such plenty of moi∣sture into the porous Parts as to strut the vessels, whereby the whole tongue is ren∣dred immoveable, till gradually such crow∣ded moisture be discharged, which done, the Tongue returns to its former state with∣out injury thereto. Likewise this same Cane effecteth the like on the swollen parts, whereto the Ointment is applyed by an ea∣sie and kind discharge of the swelling <HI>Ichor,</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="59"/>and at the same time opening the Ports for the prevention of a further accumula∣tion or return of the Disease, which I make from the cure to be originaly but a cutaneous disease, arising from the con∣stipation of the skin, which prohibiting due transpiration, thereby the swelling is formed and continued in the cutaneous parts and neighbourhood thereof, especially those that are depending, as the belly <HI>Scro∣tum</HI> and the Legs, which parts may, well be weakned by want of due exercise in daily transpirations. And therefore though the discharged matter be removed, and thereby for a time the disease in its appearance vanish, yet to confirm the same and render it a continual cure, it may be necessary, especially in persons more elderly to use warm Baths made of the aforesaid dumb Cane decocted, into the which it may be agreeable to descend an Evening before bed time, and there to con∣tinue not to faintness or sweating but a due warmth, after which frications may have their proper use and great benefit. Fur∣ther it may be convenient to change the first Bath for another, wherein <HI>Savanns</HI> Weed or Spiknard, as some call the same, being decocted make a fragrant and balsa∣mick
<PB N="101" REF="59"/>Bath to strengthen the cutaneous Fi∣bres, and restore their true tone for their better service of the offices of nature, espe∣cially the necessarily daily plentiful trans∣pirations which are absolutely necessary to health in <HI>Jamaica</HI> and such like places.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 8. <HI>Of Worms.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FRom the great moisture of the Air, be∣fore suggested, conjoyned with its quickning animating heat, it's no wonder to observe a frequent generation of Worms, either in the Stomach and Guts most usu∣ally or in other parts, oftentimes to the great interruption of Health by various annoying symptoms, chiefly and with most hazard accosting the Infant, as the moi∣stest state, as also the more grown a∣mong the Female Sex, or the debilitated among the Males far oftner than is suspect∣ed; from whence irregular Fevers and
<PB N="102" REF="60"/>Loosness, Convulsions, dejections of Ap∣petite, Nauseousness, Vomitings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> u∣sually ensue. Wherefore I scruple not, though among my few heads of disaffecti∣ons, to assign a particular Chapter thereto. Active Nature being never at rest is at all moments and in all things hatching of life, though variously more or less perfect ac∣cording to the various occurrences of Mat∣ter, Motion, and seminal Dispositions. Every creature living whether Animal or Vegetable, have their lesser and different troops of Worms, Mites, Flies, and other products arising from the heat and corrup∣ting seminal Particles. Neither is Man freed from such offensive nusances, but often lowred to the very dust from such little intestine Enemies: especially the weaker state of man, Infancy or child∣hood, whose ferment or degestive heat be∣ing not sufficiently master of their great moisture, suffer such like generations to the hazard of the harbouring structure. This evil of Worms is universal through∣out all places and climes more or less, but more especially to be remarked and sa∣vingly obviated in all hot and moist places, such as <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where from their Diet and Water as well as the place Worms
<PB N="103" REF="60"/>are found most frequent and injurious. As for the Diet, Bread being not so frequent especially in remoter places of the Island, for there most supply themselves with sweet Potatoes, and a fruity kind of bread, which gives sufficient matter to this intru∣ding Vermine, and our water being com∣monly haunted with Muskeetoes, a small sort of fly which prodigally sprinkle their Egs every where, though scarcely percep∣tible, yet in a weak Stomach may well be hatched into offensive small Stomach Worms, and act the tragical symptoms thereto. Wherefore it seems reasonable if not necessary, to provide for and fortifie a∣gainst those inbred disturbers of our more perfect health: And when by usual symp∣toms such may be suspected, we ought most speedily to labour there casting forth by proper Remedies, and such almost all bit∣ter things are found to be as well as those which partake of the irradiations of Mer∣cury or Quicksilver. From which two Topicks we cannot want a choice of ef∣fectual Remedies, and forasmuch as Chil∣dren the chief subjects of Worms and wor∣my Slime, are not easily induced to admit bitter tasted Remedies inward, it con∣cerns to contrive otherwise to answer our
<PB N="104" REF="61"/>intention. Besides the Place or Residence of the offenders is to be considered, <HI>viz.</HI> whether such be the Stomach or Bowels, if the Bowels, whether the most external as the <HI>Rectum,</HI> or more internal as the <HI>Co∣lon,</HI> or <HI>Ilia,</HI> or <HI>Jejunum.</HI> And accor∣ding to the different seat of such inter∣nal scandals or offensives of life, we diffe∣rently level our Remedies and manner of cure. If the Stomach be the residence thereof, Sickness and gripings in that part, especially at times most remote from ea∣ting, sudden qualms and incitations to vo∣miting, pains in the head, disturbed rest, stinking breath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may discover the same, and then a Vomit, about an hour af∣ter having well eaten may be the most pro∣per thereto. But if the seat of the Ver∣mine be lower in the jejune or hungry gut, a fit place to nourish these milk suckers to the deprivation of the whole Body from its due supplies, of which likewise the craving vermin being quickly cheated by the numerous sucking Chyle vessels found there, are rendred more restless, and there∣by become more easily felt by the obser∣ving Patient. However vomitings do not there usually ensue, but rather acute gripes on the sudden afflicting and thence skreeks:
<PB N="105" REF="61"/>for the greater worms being bred here for their room sake, as well as the most supply of milky juice, while they follow their quickly withdrawn milk unto the ori∣fices of the sucking vessels, may well knip the tender Fibres thereof, and cause sud∣den twitches oft complained of, to dislodge these notorious offenders, though some∣times by forcible vomiting (whereby the mouth of the Ventricle through weakness or otherwise may be relaxed) they acci∣dentally may be pumped upwards. As in such cases which happen now and then where large worms are cast forth by vomi∣tings, yet such are not natives of the Sto∣mach, but as is said before of the <HI>Jejunum</HI> or other next productive guts, wherefore the most proper conveyace for them is downwards by the force of aloetick or Mercurial Medicaments: And forasmuch as the passage is tedious for such slow mar∣chers as worms are, there are requisite re∣petitions of the protruding medicaments at least for three daies together, sometimes six they ought be stimulated to their <HI>exit</HI> by such appropriated Goads. And further to render the whole Region of the Bowels, an uneasie residence to such unwelcome guests an external plaister of our Aloes or
<PB N="106" REF="62"/>Sempervive inspirated to a due softness, which then sticks well to the Navel, is ne∣ver to be omitted; and further to specificate the same, powder of formerly ejected worms may be sprinkled therewith as most effectual to our purpose, especially for Children, who often will admit no inter∣nal. But for such who may or will be per∣swaded to take in a bitter sup of the juice of the Sempervive simple, or sweetned in∣to a dulcamare Syrup, with the aforesaid plaister applied to the Navel; they may need no further, provided such be month∣ly repeated, nay those who through daily usage of Sempervive juice in a draught of water, have rendred the same agreeable to their palates, as some have done this as well as Wormwood Wine in <HI>England:</HI> such Children or more elderly persons have had the most florid and healthy complexi∣ons of any in the <HI>Indies,</HI> as being thereby well secured against worms and ill effects thence arising. Besides not only those worms of the Guts but of the Stomach like∣wise, and the small lesser worms of all sta∣bling in the <HI>Rectum,</HI> called <HI>Ascarides,</HI> who cluster themselves in the sink of the Body or fundament, may be removed by internal∣ly received Sempervive and external appli∣cations
<PB N="107" REF="62"/>of the same bitter enemies in Baths and Injections, so then seeing Nature hath provided us so plentifully with sufficient Remedies against so common an Enemy, it's our own fault if we suffer for the want of the benefit thereof. However since some will spare the Child for his crying, and comply with the refusal of a bitter and unpleasant Remedy, we must set down an insipid though effectual one calculated to deceive the obstinacy of ill commanded Children, and such Medicaments are those which partake of Mercurial Irradiation destructive to worms where ere they are. And now I am fallen on a consideration which gives me as much wonder as any in Nature, and yet matter of fact enfor∣ceth it upon us, <HI>viz.</HI> the strange operati∣on or the way how all mercurial Bodies, such as all Metals are, operate with a kind of divinity, powerful and yet without di∣minution of their Force and Virtue. Thus the common emetick Wine may always be supplied from the same undiminished <HI>Cro∣cus Metallorum:</HI> Thus likewise the Anti∣monial Cup communicates its vomitive quality to its contained Liquor remaining the same in weight and operation, though years and ages made use of. And thus
<PB N="108" REF="63"/>our common Quicksilver, if boiled an hour or two in fair water, renders the whole without communication of scent or tast or least imaginable loss of parts of the said Mercury, a certain destroyer of worms in humane body, nay common Quicksil∣ver is enemy to worms where ere it be placed. Hence it's received that if the same be placed any where, as among Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where worms most frequently are ge∣nerated, it defends the same there from. The why and wherefore I dare not undertake to determine, <HI>Helmont</HI> solves it by an Ir∣radiation, supposing Metals according to their names to be no less than earthen Lu∣minaries, Gold as supream and most per∣fect obtains the name of the Sun, Silver that of the Moon, Tin is remarked with the sign of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> Iron with <HI>Mars</HI> his note, Copper is signalized by <HI>Venus,</HI> and Lead they give <HI>Saturn</HI>'s Character, and and our Quicksilver is commonly known by the name of Mercury, which most certainly appears to lose nothing though it be made use often thousand times effect∣ually to the killing of worms; which is af∣ter this manner: Take one ounce or two of Quicksiilver (for the quantity varies no∣thing) boyl the same in two quarts of wa∣ter
<PB N="109" REF="63"/>in a glass vessel or Bottle, pour off the water, the Quicksilver in its full weight remains at bottom, use the insipid Water not discernible, as boyled, by the most peevish palate of Children from their usu∣al drink of water, wherefore they drink freely thereof. The proper times for the same is going to bed or in the night, three nights afore and as many after the full Moon. But since this Water may only kill the worms and not bring such away, if the Child have not a loose belly (which commonly they have) a dissolution of Man∣na ℥ss, in their Chocalata may secure all by carrying forth the skinny slough and remains, which might otherwise injure health, such loosness at the time or from the cause of worms killing many Children indicates what ought to be done. And in∣deed Manna used instead of Sugar in their Chocalata is a most agreeable and proper purge in such cases, but lest the loosness like a wheel set a turning continue too long, though the moving hand be suspended, let our Child so accosted lest he be too much weakned, take of our true Sweetner of our Juices and benign quieter of nature, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>China</HI> Root powdered as much as lies on a knife point with or without as
<PB N="110" REF="64"/>much Sugar to carry it more easie down the Throat, after which washing the mouth with any Liquor, let the Child or other person be kept warm that night, and the loosness diminisheth if not quite ceas∣eth. Thus the poor and every one may easily and safely at all times be provided a∣gainst the general affliction arising from Worms and the most eminently in hot and moist Countries, as <HI>Jamaica</HI> is.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 9. <HI>Of Venereal Affects.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT may appear reasonable to whoso reads this and the other Chap. that this follows the former of Worms, and surely venereal affects in the West <HI>Indies,</HI> may well challenge a particular animadversion, affording considerable intimations to all o∣ther parts where those unhappy plants have taken root. Neither may it be impro∣per to enquire into the first Soyl of this
<PB N="111" REF="64"/>scourge of transgressing humanity, to know whence it sprung, so that by searching the originals thereof we may better eradi∣cate its foul offspring. The first open∣ing of this <HI>Pandoras</HI> Box, at least in the Eu∣ropean parts, was at the Siege of <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> where the Spaniards returning from their new found World, brought with them as great a rarity, this new found distemper. Thus they severely paid for their treacherous lavishing the Indian Blood, and the sale of their own Faith and Humanity: among others they brought this foul return of a Pox to themselves. And had they still engrost it to themselves without any participation thereof to their Neighbours, as they have laboured to do their acquests in the <HI>Indies, Europe</HI> might well have thanked them for so great a be∣nefit of their reserved Temper, but alas! a Spaniard is too free of his Flesh to be confined within his own Nation, (but like a plaguy person as they say) crowds to in∣fect others with no other than the pitiful excuse of the old ditty <HI>Solamen miseris, &amp;c.</HI> and miserable comforters are such all, especially while the anguish of this <HI>Ne∣mesis</HI> whippings makes them feel to the purpose, while the intestine enemy approa∣ches
<PB N="112" REF="65"/>the very bone, and there by violent intrusion separates the sensible <HI>Periostium.</HI> What memory of the itching cause can ad∣minister any softning relief, but rather ag∣gravate the inflamed spirit under the sense of so foolish a barter, parting with the golden State of Health and Ease for so babling a looking-Glass of their own misery? But this Itch in spite of Morals will be catching, and the beginning natural pleasure will often urge the smartful end, especially in the precipitant Youth, who scarcely sufficient∣ly dread the Fire till they have been saving∣ly burnt. Thus some are saved in a natural sense but so as by fire, and there are those who dread not a Purgatory so they may get to Heaven, but me thinks it were more desirable to need no such trying difficulties, Take away the cause and the effect will cease, fire burns not where fuell dispo∣seth not to conflagration, let the Spa∣niard enjoy with their rich Metals their fiery <HI>Vulcanoes,</HI> both as the entailed re∣sults of their American Conquests. But seeing success hath placed the English there likewise, that we may separate the pure from the impure, the Gold from its dross, enjoy the West <HI>Indies</HI> without its native
<PB N="113" REF="65"/>disease, is worth more pains and skill than I under this Topick can well afford to lavish. However, that I may not be altogether wanting herein, I may presume to sub∣joyn an observation with my conjectures thereon concerning Venereal affects, and add for the service of the remote and such as are destitute of help and remedies, such easie and natural ones as are grounded on the rea∣son of the disease and experiment thereon and ready at hand for the most needy sinner conjoyning an Empirical and rational cure of the present disease in one method of re∣lief. I find the old sower stocks of Venereal affects most plentiful among the animal In∣dians, and the cursed posterity of the na∣ked <HI>Cham.</HI> The first in the large Tracts of the American, the latter in the African deserts, both which quarters of the world bring forth the monstrous Yaws as a pro∣per Stock to engraft a new cion of Disease, and that too too fruitful in the Apples of <HI>Sodom</HI> and the bitter Fruits of <HI>Gonorrhoea,</HI> of which the Europeans to their great costs have tasted under the new dished affect, called first the Neapolitan, and then the French Disease; whose original being first the Yaws, reduceth my discourse thither. The Yaws therefore, to describe if not de∣fine
<PB N="114" REF="66"/>the same, is a seminal taint monstrously corrupting first the spermatick parts with a cold indigested putridness, bran∣ching out oft in the Groin and obscene parts, oft infecting the Mouth and Throat and parts neer the origination of the Nerves with a filthy eating crusty Scab, which needs sharp metalline corrosives to cleanse, which serves but for a time neither. For usually yearly or oftner at the cleansing times of burthened nature it returns as be∣fore. Mercurial Medicaments have chief∣ly been made use of for its internal dis∣charge, and such the same as our filthy Pox requires, the Infants oft bring it into the World with them, and are the cheif sub∣jects of its more easie invasion, indicating the taint of their spermatick original. And now I am left in a wood to find the first cause of this afflicting Enemy of Mankind, whence it sprang or whence deduced, and by ranging to and fro I meet with strange monstrous mixtures of Animal Shapes, more than ordinarily imitating the actions as well as the shapes of mankind, varying sometimes under the larger size of Ba∣boons and Drills, as on the <HI>Virginia</HI> Tracts, sometimes under that of Monkeys and Pon∣goes, as in <HI>Africa,</HI> the Native <HI>Negroes</HI> Seat,
<PB N="115" REF="66"/>or less under the <HI>Malmaset,</HI> as among the Indians of the more southern Main of <HI>A∣merica.</HI> All which at first sight bespeak too neer alliance with the Lords of the creation by some unhappy jumble of the rational with the brutal Nature, a sin a∣gainst the principles of our Being, there∣fore significantly punished as well as natu∣rally inflicted in the polluted Yawes. It was not without tacitly instructing Wis∣dom that Linsiwoolsy was forbidden by the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and the same did well prohibit the Jews sowing their Field with two sorts of Seed, and God condemned him that lay with a beast to dye, not only out of absolute sovereignty, but paternal care of his Creations good, all which tide of Nature and goodness whoso dares boldly stem, must needs reap the fruit of his de∣generacy and sordid madness in a sutable plague of morbifick Pollutions, the Dis∣ease indicating its cause in its punishment as well as natural produce. For when the rich Oar of humane Seminals shall wick∣edly wantonly be suckt in by a vastly unsu∣table <HI>Matrix,</HI> to say no worse, it must ne∣cessarily suffer egregious corruption, and not only bring forth an anomalous Breed, but convey an afflicting Taint into the sper∣matick
<PB N="116" REF="67"/>vessels of the more noble unlading Animal, who having discharged his own rich Treasure designed by nature and just rule of commutation for as rich a Cabinet, receives necessarily into the porous vacated Tube the polluted Emergencies of the brutal nature. The which how well they must necessarily agree in the internal frame of humanity, let's consider by view∣ing mishapen Satyrs, how devillishly loath∣some it is to behold a cloven foot under an erected shape, and what filthy excrescen∣cy shews a beastly superadded tail, where an humane front bespeaks a divine Majesty. As horrid a discord must needs be found in the ill blended humours within, when brutal communications in seminals jangle Nature into a confused medly, what less than unheard of corruptions do necessari∣ly emerge? Therefore loathsome to every sense and much more to the rational being, whose advantage lies in truly adjusting A∣gents with Patients, whereby his overru∣ling wisdom out-doth the whole Creati∣on, made the <HI>decorum</HI> of submitting obedi∣ence, wherefore he rightly becomes the Lord and Ruler thereof. Whereas should he descend to an unsutable communicati∣on, and such but generally obtain, he must
<PB N="117" REF="67"/>quickly quit his Royalty, if not to the beast∣ty herd it self, yet to whoso retains entire Humanity. Hence the Black may well become naturally Slaves, and the vast Ter∣ritories of the Indians be easily invaded and kept in subjection by inconsiderable force of the Spanish Tyranny. And even those Conquerours through mixture with these animal People, reap their infirmity of Body and Mind, and now lay them o∣pen to a newer and more hopeful conquest; of which it's no place for me to treat saving lightly to point at Natures disposition thereto and to warn the intending Conque∣rours to escape the same degenerating Pit of naturally necessary destruction. But forasmuch as it is too late for our present afflicted to prevent an incumbent evil, I must needs administer some relief to the Yaws ere we proceed further: and here to be more regular I advise the cleansing of the first ways as to Stomach, Guts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by a Vomit either of infusion of <HI>Crocus Metallorum</HI> or else <HI>Mercurius vitae gra.</HI> iij, or else if neither be present, of our Physick Nuts from five to nine, the next day six ordinary Pills of our native Aloes, to car∣ry off the remainder (if any) of the Vomit or moved humours. Interpose one or two
<PB N="118" REF="68"/>daies rest, and repeat the like Vomit, and succeedingly purge two daies more, and so a third time: in the most radicated and pollu∣ting Yaws, rest three daies and take away blood, if it be very thin and waterish the less, if thick ℥viij, after which at night, and so successively dress the Yawe Sore with this Unguent, take Verdigrease, put the same into a crucible or strong earthen Pot, which place in a hot fire for four or five hours, even until all the greenness of the Verdigrease disappear through the dis∣charge of ist corroding vinegar drove a∣way by the fire, and there remain a fine <HI>Calx</HI> of Copper, which put into a Crucible or earthern Pot with its equal proportion of Sea Salt, grinding them well into fine powder, which Powder is to be ur∣ged by the fire strongly for two hours, and after remove the same and grind it being reduced into a lump, expose the said Pow∣derin an earthen Pot to the night Air, afterwards with its double quantity of the fat of Snakes, mix it well into an oint∣ment, which keep for use; which may be thus, anoint the external Sores till heal∣ed; and lest such should return, use to purge them with Aloes every full Moon. But lest Aloes through much usage may
<PB N="119" REF="68"/>cause evacuations of Blood, it may be ta∣ken in the Liquor of a Water Million, which notice may serve in general in the use of Aloes or Aloetick Medicaments. To give an account why I alter the Ver∣digrease from its Vinegar, which makes it verd or green; and mix the same ra∣ther with Sea Salt, is because Sea Salt is far more penetrating, and opening both the Body of the Copper and that of the Yawy Patients, which thereby is more bal∣samically tinctured to the casting forth of of the filthy Enemy, which reason when once I had secured by experience I could not but comply with. And hitherto of the stock of our engrafted Neopolitan Dis∣ease. I must now pass to the unhappy cion finished in the Pox. Unhappy Planters who first introduced it, and more unhappy who meet not with a cure! Such as in the gene∣rality are the polluted Spaniards through∣out all their new Conquests greatly as well as justly infested with this intestine Enemy. The which we cannot but follow, the bet∣ter to chase it away from our neighbour∣hood, for even that contaminates with disposing inclinations and renders neerest friendship too hazardous. It were need less to describe this disease, or to concern
<PB N="120" REF="69"/>my self in this paper with the so often trea∣red on subject, did not something offer it self new from what I have yet, with which rendring the distemper known and there∣fore a Cure more certain and readily from the original of the Affect, <HI>viz.</HI> the Yaws produced as before said from the unnatural mixture of humane with brutal seed. So our Pox is nothing else in its first rise than a further ingrediency of the European <HI>viz.</HI> the aforesaid corrupted seminals in the Blacks and Indians from whence it may well be propagated under the present appearance of the Pox, the which in its beginning being manifest in a virulent <HI>Go∣norrhaea,</HI> leads me first to consider thereof and that differently from any thing yet re∣marked as I know of on that subject, which accidentally suggested it self from observations here made, while to my a∣mazement such running discharge mani∣fested it self, what it might be, by presenting to the the sight large living white Maggots or Worms. The which appearance streight put me on new thoughts, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Taint of corrupted seminal Particles or a corrupted odour, for such oft is a sufficient original of a <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> from and in femi∣nal vessels, may very easily produce worms,
<PB N="121" REF="69"/>and such by encreasing and swelling into bigness cause erection and streitning the <HI>Fraenum,</HI> and render the Urine obstructed and <HI>guttatim</HI> discharged, and when such Animals grow too large for the narrow Continent, they must needs burst and af∣ford the discharge which Gamesters talk of, and from the skin of the bursted Mag∣gots white raggy Fibres may shew them∣selves in the Urine. I might instance in more circumstances to render the proba∣bility, but such I leave to each expert to do for himself, the naked truth being ashamed of my English vest. After such skins are throughly cast forth, and yet the vermify∣ing Taint being not eradicated, it may in∣fest other parts of the Body with the like, though lesser vermine, the which may solve all the appearances in a confirmed Pox. Thence it is easie to render a reason of the little Twitches on the membranous parts, and if not prevented great pains at the very Bone, when these animals shall be∣gin to terebrate and work themselves into these solid parts. Also hence it may be that some parts are afflicted, while o∣thers have only sympathy to disturb them, and these passions are various according to the unhappy quicknings of these Tor∣mentors.
<PB N="122" REF="70"/>The nature of the usual Cure complies with such a conceit; therefore it is found beneficial as killing worms, as all know Mercury to be eminent. Therefore besides all bitter things, as our Purga∣tors are, prevail from the same reason, the strange long Guinny Worms, arising from the Yaw teint found especially in the Chil∣dren and Youth of the Blacks may speak somewhat on the behalf. But if the sug∣gestion be true, each one may find more to say of it, if not, I have said too much of Venereal Affects, for this place and my design. However, that I may not leave the indigent and remote Person helpless under those evils, I must according to my proposals give them a true Cure in their own reach, taking Indications from my present <HI>hypothesis</HI> and experience of the place. For that the place alters much the cure of the Disease, I question not; where∣fore <HI>Holland</HI> which is cold and moist re∣quires a double dose generally of that Phy∣sick, whereof in <HI>France</HI> single will well work and serve the turn. And in a con∣firmed Pox, they generally remove from one to to the other place, from heavier phlegmatick low Countries to the more brisk and drier Air of <HI>France,</HI> placing
<PB N="123" REF="70"/>much of cure in the nature of the Region. And ours of <HI>Jamaica</HI> being so sweatingly warm, and the Air from its Nitre pier∣cingly cleansing, assists much our ready cure, which may be thus, if we begin with the first <HI>Gonorrhoea</HI> or virulent running of the Reins, which I'll suppose to arise as first suggested, it may wholly and most safely be absolved by purgations, for which I calculate and use this native Elect∣uary, for so I call it, being composed of what the place affords; not but that most purging Pills as being bitter and aloetick, effect the same, such as <HI>Extractum Rhoei, Pill. Ruffi, Hierae cum agarico, &amp;c.</HI> How∣ever since my <HI>Jamaica</HI> Man may be desti∣tute of the former, let him provide himself of the following Electuary. Take of Pulp of Tamarinds, &amp; <HI>Cassia Fistula,</HI> of each lb ss, the Juice of our Aloes or Sempervive lb iij, of our small red Pepper dryed and powdered one Scruple, or about eight or ten of the small Cods, of <HI>Winters</HI> Bark called Cinna∣mon Bark powdered one Scruple and half, of Malasses clarified with the white of an Eg lb jss, put all these into an earthen Pot, which place in the Sun, stirring the mixtures with a wooden Spatula twice or thrice a day, let it stand till it thicken to a due temper
<PB N="124" REF="71"/>of a soft Electuary; which keep for use not only in our present case, but as a ge∣neral purging Electuary. When such may be requisite, whereof from ℥ss to ℥iss, may be a Dose taken downwards, and by way of Clyster ℥ij may be admitted. Let the Patient of our present cure take ℥ss thereof, or two good broad knifes points full in the morning fasting, and as much at night going to bed, two hours after having ea∣ten some spare supper: continue such usage every other day, till the <HI>Gonorrhoea</HI> or running of the Reins cease. Let the diet be temperate, though I prohibit nothing but excess in quantity: The <HI>Madera</HI> Wine with water may rather be drunk than cool drinks, from which I diswade, water being more preferable though alone, Garlick in all his Sauces may comply with the inten∣tion of the Cure as being an Enemy to Worms, as all bitter herbs. Neither may salt meat be forbidden for the same reason, I never add but strictly disswade the use of astringent Pills, such conducing to pro∣long our distemper into a confirmed Pox, which I cure the same way but in more time. As for those who cannot be at the charge of the former Electuary, let them take of the juice of Sempervive in all the water
<PB N="125" REF="71"/>they drink, or the liquor of Water Mil∣lion; they may more properly take the same for preventing the force of Aloes in the opening of the vessels and effusion of blood thereby. However take care of repeating such occasions of cure, lest by usage it proves less effectual, and by a continued taint of the vessels amount to a compleated Pox; which to describe, is an universal sour taint of the spermatick parts. From whence and from prevaricated natural heat, especially at the time of the Moon, and other circumstances, may be quickned into life, and then disturbing motion, a kind of small worms, such as appear in Vinegar and degenerated Juices, which <HI>Animalcula</HI> by twitching the membranous parts cause those pains which are usually felt there, as well the usual ones such as are easily born, as those which exceed in cruciating torture, while these worms terebrate the bones, or the immediate covering there∣of called the <HI>Periostium.</HI></P>
<P>But if these quickned Executioners take their course outward towards the skin, they then worst themselves there, and by forcing themselves through the skin dy and ly buried in the crusting Scabs easily known by the eye of each due obser∣ver,
<PB N="126" REF="72"/>which last apparent discharge is most usually in the <HI>Indies,</HI> because the dai∣ly sweating and open Pores incline thereto, so that pains at Bones are less frequent here than in the colder northern Parts, wherein the hard constrictions of the skin through cold encourage these Animals to harbour inward. For which reason cold weather may well most afflict such Pati∣ents in such places: but between the warm Tropicks such accidents rarely if ever hap∣pen except in the grisles of the Nose, which being neer at hand and recipient of the discharging Brine is often hazarded thereby through the ignorance of the pre∣tending Curers, signally marking the sinner by a breach in that part; from which accidents as well as others of the Pox, as also from the bitter Root thereof, that the concerned may better free them∣selves; there are two intentions to be considered from the nature of the Disease, the first is killing the vermine and eradica∣ting the rest of sour spermatick Juices; the second is to sweeten the vessels and intro∣duce a contrary order that may defend from the former impression. The first is performed either by Aloetick or other bitter Purgations, such as are enemies to
<PB N="127" REF="72"/>worms, as those are of a mercurial na∣ture, the latter being obvious <HI>Lippis &amp; tonsoribus</HI> leaves the first to be more par∣ticularly remarked as being most safe and sufficiently effectual. Let therefore the transgressor punish himself by conformity to the ensuing course, let him take of the Electuary before described ℥j every other morning, unless some accident prohibit, if he exceed or lessen the Dose according as as he finds it purge him, it matters little save time: At night let him take of our China powder ʒj, and drink of the Drink made for that purpose of China Root, warm to sweat with, the drink ought be made new every day without being fer∣mented with Sugar or Age, the Water is only to be boiled as that for Tea usually is half away, then so much China sliced added thereto as may make the decoction of a Clarret colour: there can be no excess in that Root, neither need ought be added save for palate sake a little Sugar, but it's better without for our intention; let him drink thereof every night in bed plentiful∣ly about two quarts, the better to sweeten the sower Juices which China powerfully doth in these affects, as well as in others, such as the Gouts, Tertians, Hecticks,
<PB N="128" REF="73"/>Consumptions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Moreover to comply with the same intention, there is a most admirable Gum, which the wounded Boars have found out for us: for they presently betake themselves to the Trees, and strike it with their Tushes, for their cure outflows a thick balsamick juice which hardens to the consistence of Bees Wax in the Air, neither is it unlike thereto, but transcends any Gum I have yet met with in its pleasant perfume, this Gum hath no forbidden quality, but admirably com∣plies with our intentions in the present case as well as in many other, of which elsewhere. That which Turpentine per∣forms through its fragrant passing the uri∣nary and other waies (for by such odour Il'e suppose it beneficial) this Gum out∣does, more powerfully impressing those parts with salutiferous perfumings, agreea∣ble to the intention in our present case, whereby the cure is perfected and secured, where I will take leave to end my dis∣course.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 10. <HI>Of the Dry Belliach.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I refer my hardest task to the last, that my thoughts may have a longer time and experience for their happy intimations concerning the Bellyach. A Disease so called from its most urgent symptome, which is exquisite pain, suffered under this affect in that same most sensible part; a Part by God himself styled the seat of fel∣low feeling and divine sympathy; most ten∣der, and therefore most ready to receive all impressions; most necessary to life, and therefore when obstructed long, carrying most feeling horror with it: from its seat it may seem to have some alliance with iliack and colick Passions, and sometimes it may add both of them to it self, which however are but consequents or rather con∣comitants and not the disease, no more than the shadow is the Body. This Bellyach as well as those additional torments may need the invocation as well as the name of <HI>mise∣rere
<PB N="130" REF="74"/>mei:</HI> For, to confess the truth, if any thing hath dismal aspect in the <HI>Indies,</HI> it is this Disease of the dry Belliach. But that not so much from the incurableness as the want of care, there being no impossibility there∣in, were ignorance banished: As for my self though I may grope as in the dark in an unknown path; yet through the gui∣dance of my observation from the nature of the Affect, the Attributes thereof, its in∣separable Conjuncts, its Causes and Circum∣stances, Symptoms, Consequents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> comparing the West <HI>Indies</HI> with the East, I cannot but presume to hold the Candle in this same darksome distemper. The general occasional cause is contracting cold, excepting there, where contagion from ex∣crements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hath propagated its like, a cold not to be found in the Northern Climes, but even there where the Sun showers his most plentiful heat. Thus the sharpest Vinegar results from the sweetest Wine, thus freezing by the fire side must needs be the most violent; thus hardest Steel is made by the softning fire, and cold taken between the hot Tropicks if seated in the region of the Belly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Cramps the Muscles of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> and tender Fibres of the Guts with the con∣tractings
<PB N="131" REF="74"/>of the torturing Bellyach, and there's the original Cause, heres the for∣mality of the direfull Distemper. Nei∣ther may it seem strange, that Cold and Heat should so eminently meet in one place, while the whole World is upheld by its bounding contraries, &amp; consequently where heat is intended cold must obtain its pro∣portion of contracting vigour (wherein its formality lies) though not of extending enlargement; so that there may be more cold in less room, though less room for cold. Therefore if Cold in such places chance to obtain, its Tyranny may be most severe and cruelly urging; thus strong Springs drawn closest project the strong force, exercising their aggravated Ener∣gies with greatest violence. For Cold is not a simple privation of heat, but a strong competitor therewith, and strengthens its opposite, while it subdues its force to it self: Thus the conquering heat growes strong through the acquest of subjected cold; the strugling Enemy inflaming his Conquerour to keep it under. And if ere he chance to break the yoaking Bond, with what violence doth the Captive triumph, cruciating the tender Fibres with obdurate contractions; wherein the sharp sting of the
<PB N="132" REF="75"/>Bellyach lies. But further to assign a suf∣ficient compleat cause for so great an evil as we see this Bellyach to be: we must add the superior aggravator of all Spasms and con∣vulsive motions, <HI>viz.</HI> the Moon, which we have reason to allow as the timer of such like affects: for it is at her full that the tide of such nervous Diseases rise highest, and in a place where her direct Beams, as between the Tropicks, are most strong, this Spasm of the Bellyach may well derive an afflicting enforcement. Neither is such supposition chymerical, to give more power to the direct aspect of the Moon between the Tropicks than she may challenge elsewhere; for demonstration evinceth it frequently, that Fish taken in the moist Moon-shiny nights most sud∣denly grow short and rotten, nay that side of the fish which chanceth to ly open to that light, while the covered part of the Fish remains more firm. Moreover I have seen my self most severe Spasms of the one half of a man who hath ventured to sleep in the Moonshine, and other lesser Spasms through long continuance under this noct∣urnal Luminary. Moreover that our as∣signed causes may not come short of the great effect, we may well add the mine∣ral
<PB N="133" REF="75"/><HI>Gas</HI> descending from the Caverns of the mountanous Tracts; most eminently manifesting themselves in our cold Norths, as a reasonable aggravator if not producer of such affects. And that such <HI>Gas</HI> must needs break forth from mountanous hol∣lows, no one will hesitate; and that such e∣gregiously affect the nervous parts, and cramp oft the tender Fibres in weaker men with convulsive Spasms, is as easily gran∣ted. I have known in the Lead Works in <HI>Derby,</HI> there where the fumes of the se∣parating <HI>Oar</HI> hath infested the Air, which as heavy laden with its weighty inmate, and falling on the neighbouring fields of Grass, hath communicated the same effect to the grasing Cattle as our torturing Bel∣lyach, of which the brutal Patients give sufficient notices by their bellowing com∣plaints, their restless motions, and convul∣sive Deaths. Again, the nature of the Parts first affected ought chiefly to be con∣sidered, forasmuch as thence flow the most eminent apparent evils, such as the consti∣pation of the Belly, obstructing or lessening of the peristaltick motion; thence infla∣ming heat; and thence obdurateness of ex∣crementitious Passengers; thence their im∣moveable resistance; from whence the ag∣gravation
<PB N="134" REF="76"/>of the first Evils with addition of irritating vomitings, corruptions of Chyle in∣to porraceous and adust Choler, dejections of Appetite, and a general infirmity, with an <HI>Iliad</HI> of Evils linking each other to falter the infirm Man to his uneasie Couch. At the first seasure of this Evil, the Muscles of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> and sometimes those of the Breast, through contractions prove hard and pain∣ful, as in our ordinary Cramps; the Pulse heavy and slow, yet eaven enough, after some time the pain is shifting and commu∣nicated to the Muscles of the Back; thence the Urine flows sparingly and appears red as if Brick were mixed therewith: Pain aggravates more and more; and want of sleep and rest, with other uneasiness and commotions of mind and Body, entail a symptomatical Fever, which alters and changes as it causes do. This feverish Af∣fect and irregular hudling up and down of the contained Juices, with unhappy stop∣page in the contracting fibrous Pipes of the Muscles, still inflame the cruciating pains, and like added Cyphers to the first sum, mount it high enough, sometimes to bank∣rupt nature. But more oft spin out the Thread of life to a longer durance miserable and afflictive; for heated nature by its of∣ten
<PB N="135" REF="76"/>tryals to fling off her oppressions, vio∣lently forceth the crude and indigested Li∣quor into the small nervous Passages, fitted for most fine indwellers, but perforce re∣ceptive now of such more gross ones, which obstruct and plug them up, whence lameness in such parts necessarily succeeds; and an Atrophy encreasing the weakness of the Members, till neither hand nor foot be able to help; nor yet the Physitian quickly, but Nature and time effecteth it if ever. However to prevent the height of those accumulated Evils, and restore the the lost limbs and weak parts with what speed possible; something may be inser∣ted not improper nor insuccesful. And now I cannot but desire the Western People, without superstition to turn their faces Eastward, and see there the usages proper to such a temperament, to consider what they there do and why, with the happy sequel or matter of fact. That in hot Countries sweating is natural as well as necessary needs no argument, and where necessa∣ries are liable to be obstructed, the proper Remedies to remove are or ought to be most ready at hand; and where such are neglected, ill consequences may well en∣sue. Hence the West <HI>Indies</HI> though of
<PB N="136" REF="77"/>the same temperament with the East, may sustain superadded Evils, which the cust∣oms of the East wisely prevent and preserve themselves free from. It is matter of fact, they are little afflicted if any thing at all with this Evil there: And I cannot assert a better reason thereof than their profi∣table usages of Baths and Unctions, by which the cutaneous and muscular Fibres being secured from contracted Spasms, and kept open for the constant discharge of transpiring Particles; the original of the Bellyach is cut off, as also the crowd of ensu∣ing Symptoms before mentioned: Where∣fore let whoso fears and carefully would avoid so great an evil, be provided with convenient bathing Tubs or places adap∣ted to so necessary an office in a sweating Country. Let him alwaies after travelling and such like exercisings descend thereto, having such sutably warmed and refresh∣ingly sweetned with Orange Flowers, or the Waters thereof, or with our Spiknard or other sweet Herbs. For such Sweets allure the Spirits outward to supply the extream Parts to withstand their cutane∣ous Contractions, which else might hin∣der transpiration, but now by Bathing being called forth, and encreased at least
<PB N="137" REF="77"/>in the extream Parts, the formality of the Bellyach is removed at an easie rate. An agreeable unction of Orange Flowers or Jessamine Butter or such like, lightly rub∣bed ore the Skin; especially of the Belly, Back, &amp; Stomach, may further render useful the Bath for the ends proposed: And those not only of preventing the Bellyach, but curing it likewise. Let such a Patient there∣fore under the binding constrictions of the Bellyach, betake himself to such a like Bath, and therein sit or lye as long as he may well bear the same, then be removed into a Bed and be rubbed and well anointed with fragrant not strong pungent Oyls. For the latter may well cause further con∣tractions, whereas the more kind and soft may relax the bondage; if the Excrements of the Bellyach need, as oft they do, an auxi∣liary discharge, let a Clyster of Malasses, in Milk or in the want thereof with water be injected just as they enter the Bath, which may well forward a beneficial Stool and the quieting of the Bowels. As for a spe∣cifick (for the Indians have many such) my Worthy Friend Doctor <HI>Lawford</HI> of the Island of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> humanely communi∣cated a remarkable one in this case to his Exellency My Lord <HI>Vaughan,</HI> by whose
<PB N="138" REF="78"/>favour for the benefit of the afflicted, I subjoyn the same, having found the Plant as described, through the assistance of an in∣genious Botanick Friend here, who by the description taken out of <HI>Piso,</HI> P. 102. happily met with the same, of which saith the sagacious Doctor, he had a hun∣dred tryals, powdered I give, saith he ʒj, in any convenient Liquor, and repeat it once in three or four hours till the usual symptoms of the disease abate; sometimes I give ℥j, ℥ij, ℥iij, of it in Syrups: also in de∣coctions and Clysters. It is an admirable An∣tidote agaist the biting of Serpents, and I have found it a great Diaphoretick in ma∣lignant Fevers. So far the Doctor to his excellency, referring to the Plant it self un∣der the name of <HI>Cajacia,</HI> called by the Spa∣niard <HI>Erudos Cobres;</HI> which in English is a Snakeweed, for its great use and service fre∣quently known to the Spaniards. <HI>Pisoes</HI> de∣scription is exact thus, it is a small creeping milky Plant, its Leaves not unlike those of Mint but longer and smaller, of a dark green colour: its Stalk inclining to a reddishness with small Fibres or hairy Roots, between its leaf at the joints of its Stalk come forth Flowers of a green colour in small Bun∣ches. This specifick being every where
<PB N="139" REF="78"/>to be found growing in all sorts of Soyl and therefore ready at hand, I'll detain my Reader no further, but recommend in my former prescribed Baths in this distem∣per to be better specificated by boyling of this <HI>Cajacia</HI> therein; and for strengthening the lost Limbs let the weakned parts be fortified with an Emplaster of our afore described Gum: the which may well be renewed once in twenty four hours using warm frictions to the parts so affect∣ed. And after such usage the Plaisters to be continued till strength is restored and confirmed to the suffering Criple, who then may fling away the Crutches of adventitious helps, where I rejoyce to leave my Patient.</P>

<HEAD>The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>AS I prefaced those Chapters of which particularly I have now treated with the occasions thereof, and my Method therein, and the Reasons inducing thereto: So now by way of conclusion to the whole, I shall subjoyn somewhat that may have place in each case, where Nature shall want due assistances or vigorous fortifying, as she may sometimes in any of the fore∣mentioned affects. As also recommend the East Indian or other Countries like ours of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> their laudable if not necessary usages of Baths for the keeping free and open the Pores to healthful tran∣spirations and more copious Sweatings. The which for want of such assistances, at some time or other may cause our Belly∣ach, many of our Tertians and other Fe∣vers, Dropsies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> rationally to be pre∣vented by due and proper Bathings. The
<PB N="141" REF="79"/>reasons whereof are very obviously two, the one is cleansing from relicts of obstru∣cting sweat, whereby the porous Passa∣ges being opened easily admit a thorough∣fair to Natures ejectments: The other is the preservation of the Tone and Spring of the fibrous Skin, for the better strength of her necessary functions, both which are secured by bathing and proper anoin∣tings. Wherefore let whoso desires the continuance of Health and vigour in this our Island, provide himself proper ba∣thing Places, and use the same frequently, especially after Travellings, at which time we are lyable to Fevers, as also upon all lassitudes and listless indisposition, not presently after, but rather before eating, and four hours after at the time of distri∣bution of nourishment into the extream outward parts: Then may such most pro∣perly be exercised with rubbings in a warm Bath, into which let the desirous of health descend carefully both of time in residing there, and the manner thereof: The time, that it may not exceed to faint∣ness, but refreshment, caused as well from Natures relief from her oppressed Bur∣thens, as by sweet smells effected by odori∣ferous Herbs or Flowers or sweet Waters
<PB N="142" REF="80"/>superadded to such Baths, after which being carefully dried and gently anoynted, let such pass into their Beds, and there re∣main half an hour, not to sweat, but com∣pose nature to a fit briskness of exercising new vigour, when they arise to their for∣mer employ. Thus tyred wearisomness too incident to hot Countries is defeated, life it self vigorated in all its exercisings, and thereby becomes less liable to Disease. There remains as general a restaurative and high, most innocent Cordial, where∣ever nature shall need succours either for the Sick or well habited Man; of which since we are neer the place of its being usually found, I must say somewhat both of its nature and use to our desired end. It hath been already received by all that Ambergriese is a great friend to Nature, and its use hath already placed it in high Price and great Demand. It hath every where been esteemed fit to attend the Courts of Princes and great Men: but yet it is not concluded what it may be, vo∣lumes have swelled with diversity of opi∣nions about this restaurative Treasure, though each agree in its just transcendent benefit; I shall not trouble my self to repeat the false opinions concerning it: for there
<PB N="143" REF="80"/>can be but one adjusted to the truth, and all the other must needs miss the mark. In general I can never believe it any Mineral or <HI>Bitumen,</HI> because it is so throughly innocent, and its perfection consists in light∣ness. No excrement of any animal, Fish or other, as of a great Bird, as the volumi∣nous German imagins it, because of its long duration and liquid unctuousness dis∣cernable by heat. No Liver of a Fish, as some have suggested, from its fibrousness observed when fresh; which may otherwise be salved: besides it dissolves not, nor hard∣ens as all Livers do by dry heat. And it were strange to find the Liver without some other parts of the Fish. But nega∣tives proving nothing, I must add matter of fact; and that, wheresoever Amber∣griese is usually found, there are poiso∣nous and venomous Fish, as about the <HI>Bar∣mudas, Bahame</HI> Islands, and the Coasts of <HI>Florida, &amp;c.</HI> Secondly, that the Inha∣bitants of such places, when ever poiso∣ned with Fish, which often they are, they betake themselves to Ambergriese as a most powerful Antidote, and are cured therewith, and rescued from the other∣wise most horrid Symptoms threatning life hastily, without the assistances of this
<PB N="145" REF="81"/>sovereign Remedy. Thirdly, that from the good success it had agaiust Poi∣son, the People there venture on it in almost all their weaknesses, in great e∣vacuations by Vomitings and Stools, and all other too liberal discharges of nature and strength: In dispiritments from Fevers or any other affect they happily take Am∣bergriese. And which adds to its desira∣ble innocency, they stand not on quantity from any other cause than the precious∣ness of that Commodity. I have seen the Man who by good luck in finding a quantity hereof hath eaten ʒij at a time, without any prejudice to himself or any alteration to the state of health, saving that he was cheerfully disposed as persons are by drink∣ing good Wine or use of <HI>Opium.</HI> But our Amber excels both, for it neither stupe∣fies nor intoxicates as Wine and Opiates are apt to do; but unites by its odorife∣rous parts to the Spirits themselves, and strengthens by such addition these brisk Ministers of life and sense, thereby enabling to cast forth an Enemy, or receive its assault without sinking under the same. The ad∣vantage of such Auxiliaries exceds far the transient inflammatory ones of burning Spirits: such as those of Wine or any other
<PB N="145" REF="81"/>such vegetable ones less natural. Our more benign Amber carries no such ha∣zard with it: it's not like these volatile Spirits who like forreign Pidgeons though for a little while may augment the home fed Stock, yet quickly deceive the hopes of the owner by carrying his proper ones in place of staying themselves; the like doth not seldome happen to those profuse crowders of warming mixtures under the characters of Cordials, whereby the spi∣rits are hurried into a brisk motion the sooner to hasten an <HI>exit.</HI> The first foun∣tain of all descending Physick, the divine <HI>Hippocrates</HI> had no such Spirits for his fa∣miliars; <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> men first brought them into use, Nature knows nothing of such: they may serve as external fire in cold Countries to exercise the healthy, but conduce little to the Sick, saving to gratify them that use them, or from custome ex∣pect such attendants. Whereas our be∣nign and powerful Ambergriefe, neither serves the ignorant Pomp of thronging the sick mans Chamber with useless Glasses, nor indangers enflaming the weak Spirits to a Consumption of the much rather to be encreased Stock: nor spurs hurrying nature to an overhazarding strein: But
<PB N="146" REF="82"/>succours with adventitious and lasting strength conveyed apparently by subtile and lasting odour, such as Nature her self hath adapted and cooked without any fur∣ther trouble than dissolution in Wine or Broth or other warmed Liquids. The which when received into the sensible Sto∣mach rejoyceth therewith, and is perfu∣med thereby to a continued sending of the same impressions into the whole Body; whereby the Spirits, especially the Animal ones, are not heated but refreshingly che∣rished and strengthened to their proper functions and ejectments of forreign morbi∣sick Taints not only of the egregious poiso∣nous ones but all other less noxious. Hence vomiting and loosnesses cease thereby, if managed as directed in our fifth Chapter; intemperate heats in Fevers (as in our sixth Chap. described) if urging to faintness may be obviated; weakned nature under Dropsies, of which in our seventh Chap. becomes fortified; putrefactive fumes from Worms and wormy Slimes of which in the eight Chap. is over-ruled; debilities in vene∣real affects, whereof the ninth treateth, may be signally remedied, and the horrid Spasm in the dry Bellyach (of which our tenth Chap.) is best provided. Thus we dare as∣sign
<PB N="147" REF="82"/>Ambergriefe to be our most univer∣sal and proper Cordial, from which no detriment but benefit if rightly admini∣stred for the most part, which is enough for any medicament, ensues the receiving thereof. Wherefore from matter of fact in its sovereign usefulness, from the places of its being found and circumstances there∣about, I will conclude with my best con∣jectures concerning this great restaurative Medicament as well as most deservedly rich Commodity, which I believe to be a Marine Plant growing on the Rocks or shoals of such places where poisoning Fish are, not unlike the species of <HI>Caragauta</HI> or <HI>Manguey</HI> or <HI>Metle</HI> a large strong and thick leaved and succulent Plant, whose leaves if broke afford a thick roapy juicy <HI>bitumen</HI> not unlikely to appearance of the white or black Amber, both which I'll suppose from the same vegetable. But that the black is the more recent dropped juice, and therefore most heavy; the grey such as by duration laying on the sand neer the Root of its original ere it be moved thence becomes more light, as washed with the cleansing Pickle of the Salt Waters from its more crude parts; thence it's made grey and more porous and therefore lighter.
<PB N="148" REF="83"/>Whereas the newer Juice, such as affords the Black Amber; may well be the first or new running of such a vegetable caused either by the browsing Fish, who hast∣ning thither for this Antidote and break∣ing its inclosing Plant, may cause it to send forth this precious Juice, either by storms cast up on the surface of the water present∣ly, and then it must be black; or if it re∣main longer on the ground where it first run from its original, it turns as said before grey and may be mixed with little sands and fish scales oftentimes found therein: or else if the Fish that hath plentifully fed thereon chance suddenly to be taken, in such it may be seen, as also in Sea Fowl who allured by the smell, when cast on the shore by Storms, and devouring much of the same, being grateful to all life may puzle catchers of such Fowl, and make them san∣cy that Amber is the produce of that A∣nimal. Whereas as much reason is there for every sort of Fish, who eats thereof, and may discover the same if taken in due time: Wherefore since we justly may not ascribe it to one more than another, I ra∣ther conclude it as before suggested from no Animal but such a like marine Plant placed by divine bounty and wise provi∣sion
<PB N="149" REF="83"/>for the relief of poisoned Fish ori∣ginally, and thence to be brought to our more happy knowledge and use, and to the singular benefit of the Creation, in which blessed Concord all things naturally most sweetly harmonize, singing an universal <HI>Te Deum,</HI> wherein may I but bear an agree∣able part I have my end.</P>
