<P>Notwithstandinge that Stensel Thurso hath beene in treatise with the Counte of Bucquoy / the Hungarians never thelesse in Neuheusel would by no meanes yealde or consente / but haue threathned rather to deface the sayd Thurso / then to deliuer themselves / and there∣fore this weeke many peeces of Ordinance and munition is conveyed thither / to constraine it with Shoting: Likewise are thither sente <HI>600000.</HI> Florines / and <HI>200000.</HI> Florines in Iewels / to paye to our Souldiors <HI>3.</HI> moneths of wages. In meane time the Hungarians are continually in skirmigges with ours / and Betlem Gabor should fortifye himselfe at Cas∣sau to succour and deliuer Neuheusel / but the Lord Setschi should hinder unto him the Pas∣sage.</P>
<P>On this part the Earle Colaldo hath taken the goods of Budany out of the invincible Cas∣tle of gissingen / and hath gotten a great quan∣tity of corne and wine and he proceedeth now forward to Papa and the Cauish Bounds.</P>
<P>In Moravia some notable Lords and Citi∣zens are againe emprizoned / with whome the Execution / as likewise with them of Prague / should bee advaunced this weeke / and Eras∣mus and Geordge of Landaw schould bee as Prisoners with the first conveyed to this Cittie.</P>

<P>The <HI>7.</HI> of this moneth / the ould Martin Fau∣wijn / one of the prisoned Directors / leaped from the higest of the white tower into the Moatt and dyed presently / his body is yesterdaye quar∣tered / and brought upon the high wayes / but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Head and right hand is fastened upon the gallowes in the New towne / they saye the Exe∣cution of the other Prisoners should be done upon Mourdaye or Tuesdaye next.</P>
<P>Because the menne of warre are dismissed in∣to Slesia / therefore from hence some Captai∣nes are sent thither with money for the states of Bohemia to haue yet a whole Regiment for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Emp.

The Citie of Tabor keepes yet / skirmishing dayly with theyr enne∣mies / keeping no quarter on both sides / but al Soldi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs that are taken were presently hang∣de. The Superiour Frenck is hier also.</P>
<P>The Emperours iourney hither / should bee upon the <HI>5.</HI> of Iuly and the Electorial day at Regenspurgh the <HI>1</HI> of September.</P>
<P>The Peasants of Bokemia / that have ioyned them (whereof is rehearsed in former time) in∣crease dayly more and more.</P>
<P>The Colonnel of Wallensteen / was wel sent against them to slaye them / but findinge him∣selfe to weake / is returned home without any effect.</P>

<P>The Earle Colaldo is with his menne neere Loment / and his matters do not proceed wel / because the Budian fortifyth himselfe more and more / and expected yet <HI>3000.</HI> menne / and under∣taketh like wise to diverte some Spanschaps of the Emperour / and because the Earle is weake

<P>And there is a strong mutual Bond and Con∣federation betwixt the King of Bohemia / Den∣nemarcke / Sweden / Lowsaxonie and the Low Confederated lands erected and confirmed / so that it appeareth that the warre shall rise on al parts. The Duke of Bavari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> formed his men∣ne of warre at <HI>5.</HI> Monsterplaces / and taking in hand the Executiō against these lands / hee shall find perhaps resistaunce enough.</P>

The Spaniars under the com∣maundement of Don Consaluo de Cordua be∣ginue to runne away apace / and many passe dayly throug Heydelbergh / where Letters of passage are graunted unto them / to passe tho∣roug the Country without any disturbaunce or hinderaunce / many likewise dye for hunger and want / so that the Spanish host mightly decea∣seth and affoyblisched in number.</P>

<P>The General Veer / traveleth up and down in the Palts to Visite the troupes / and caused li∣kewise the Rhyn-bridge at Manheym to bee demolished / but as it is refered / with no other consideration but that the <HI>Sulpenlio Armorum</HI> should inviolably bee keept / will not permitte neverthelesse that the Spaniards should exact and require any coutribution of the subiects / because they could not maintaine it when Spi∣nola was with them. It seemes that the Spa∣niards haue no great minde to remayne any longer / because it is al wasted and consumed in theyr quarters / and no Prices are more to bee had.</P>
<P>Of the departinge neverthelesse of the Spa∣niards is no newes yet / in meane time the countrey menne are miserably vexed / a nd upon the Limites they beginne to offende one a other which perhaps shall cause greater troubles.</P>
<P>It is signifyed hier that the Marquis Spi∣nola should proceede in the Field the <HI>25</HI> of this moneth / h auinge warned and conscribed against that time al his Commaunders / Superiors and force of menne.</P>

<P>The Spanish Garrison in the land of Gulick hath receaved as yet no money / but they hope shortly to get it.</P>
<P>At Herentals and some other places the Gar∣risons began to murmure / but it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anifested / and many are apprehended / who are in great daunger and trouble / many likewise arun∣fled.</P>
