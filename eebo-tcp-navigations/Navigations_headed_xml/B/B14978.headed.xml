<HEAD>From Pague the 23. of September 1621.</HEAD>
<P>Some few dayes agoe, there is carried againe an other great Piece of Canon out of this Citty store∣house to Tabor, and although those of Tabor perceiue the resolute consiancy of the besiegers, and that dayly more and more men resort to them, for all that they are the more scornefull, and the more make a scoffing of it, because that they haue receiued comfort from Mansfield of their onset by him at the first. And newes commeth from Silessa, that the Soldiers of that Country haue taken the Citty of Glatz by composition, but what the conditions are is as yet vnknowne.</P>
<P>We had héere aduice yesterday that the Earle of Mansfield was agréed with the Duke of Bauaria, namely that he should pay to him the said Earle <HI>300</HI> thousand Florins, but to his Soldiers <HI>3.</HI> monthes wages, and whosoeuer would be content to serue a∣gaine, that he should goe to Hungaria also to voyde and pull downe all the Sconces and fortresses about the Palatinate, likewise the said Duke should pro∣cure pardon for Mansfield by the Emperors Maie∣sty, vpon condition that all his life time he should not serue nor beare Armes against the house of Au∣stria, Bauaria, nor Spaine, and that in recompence thereof hée should be made an Earle of the Empire, with other conditions more, whereupon he with his whole army is retired, taking his iourney towards Ambergh.</P>

<HEAD>From the Bergstrate the 28. of Sept. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>The Spaniards haue begun the <HI>26.</HI> hereof to shoote vpon the Towne of Franckendal, but be∣cause that those within defended themselues vali∣antly, they the last night retired from thence, and went to Keysers Lautexen, what their they shal effect we shall heare. At this instant great burning hath béene séene in diuere places about the same ter∣ritories.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From the vpper Palatinate the 28. of Sept. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>Wée are héere in these Countries in a miserable state, because that the Earle of Mansfield will not accept the agréement with the Duke of Bauaria, also because the said Mansfield hath vnderstood, that the Magistrates at Ambergh with the Nobility and City, haue yéelded themselues to the deuotion of the Duke of Bauaria, the said Earle is marched for∣ward, hath spoyled, ransacked and burnt, the faire Market towne Hantpach, &amp; Slicht, and killed ma∣ny poore subiects, hath also besieged Vilseek, &amp; now he swarmeth with the most part of his Horsemen round about Ambergh, those of the Citty haue shut their Gates, refusing to let him come in, wherefore the Earle hath sworne, that within two dayes he would enter the Towne, which is feared shall not be without bloodshed. And there is such flying, and retiring in all the Country that it cānot be written, In the meane time the Bauarians haue taken Camb, where he lost <HI>800</HI> men. Neuenkirk, Walt∣munchen, Prug, Blegensteyn, Kemer, Grasermeer, Waldeck, and other places, where he caused the In∣habitants to doe him homage, likewise he hath sum∣moned Newenmarckt, but Mansfield hath put gar∣risons therein.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From the vpper Palatinate the 29. of Sept. 1621.</HEAD>
<P>This day in the forenoone is the Earle of Mans∣field arriued heere at Newenmarckt, with <HI>6.</HI> Com∣panies of Horse, the Souldiers lye héere and there dispersed, what they intend on both sides to doe, is not yet knowne.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From the Palatinate the 2. of October 1621.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>30.</HI> of September the Spaniards tooke in Lamsheym, our Horsmen are all gone to their quar∣ters at Seckenheym, Neckerhausen, and Edingen, they distrust to be able to resist the Spanish forces, they are not strong enough both on Foot and Horse∣men. To day a <HI>1000.</HI> Soldiers are trayned at Nec∣kerhausen, The Spaniards keepe themselues at Franckendal, it is thought that they will march to Newstat.</P>
<P>The <HI>30.</HI> of September, she horsemen of Ouer∣trout, haue ransacked the suburbes of Weinheim, they will likewise ransacke the Towne it selfe, be∣cause that they haue yéelded themselues to the Spaniards.</P>
<P>At Heydelburgh they make before Newenheym a land partition, and a Bulwarke, whereupon great pieces of Ordenance may be planted. On the other side they haue taken downe the tower called Trots Keyser, and filled it with earth, and péeces of Canon shall be set vpon it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From the Berghstreet the 1. of October, 1621.</HEAD>
<P>Before Franckendal <HI>600.</HI> Spanish soldiers were slaine in one assault, it is thought they will retire from thence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Cullen the 5. of October 1621.</HEAD>
<P>Thrée dayes past, those of Gulicke being <HI>7000.</HI> men strong, sallyed out with <HI>Thomas Viller</HI> his hors∣men, &amp; tooke in a Sconce by Lintsenich on this side of the Roer, wherein some of the Spanish souldiers were slaine, and so with their Lieutenant were ta∣ken prisoners and brought into Gulicke, who the next day were all released againe, the said Leiute∣nant remaining surety for their ransome.</P>
<P>These of Gulick haue made a Sconce on the Ro∣erbridge, through which they can fall out, they haue also these dayes past shot furiously out of it, to hin∣der the Spaniards from making their fortifications, whereouer some were killed. In the meane time the gates of Gulick stand yet open, and the Cattle goeth yet out to pasture, and the women and Children of the Soldiers in Gulick, are yet suffered to come in the towne, And thus the Towne and fortresses is yet well prouided of all necessaries.</P>
<P>From <HI>France</HI> is the Death of Duke of Mayne confirmed, being besides him many Noble and Gen∣tlemen slaine, with some odde hundreths of soldiers. And moreouer the contagious disease is great in the Kings leager, if hée will their continue it is much doubted of. It is likewise reported that the Duke of Rohan is néere, with some thousands of men rea∣dy and néere to reléeue the siege from Montaubon.</P>
<P>The Duke of Rohan hath with him <HI>20000.</HI> men, and hath sent word to the King, that he will not come to any agréement, before all the affaires of France be first pacified, and by fault thereof, that he will resist him to the vttermost, although he should be forced to auoyde the Kingdome.</P>
<P>We heare from <HI>Rees,</HI> that they worke yet hard on the new Forts ouer the Rhine, that right ouer the Town of Emmerick another Fort should he made, otherwise no mutation of things was done, nor also of the Spanish side, it séemeth that by reason of the long raining weather at this time, no further enter∣prises shall be vnder taken.</P>
