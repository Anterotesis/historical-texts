<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He last great and sudden Frost, hath beene cause that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> gave over the siege inten∣ded against <HI>Landsberg:</HI> And having given order for the fortifying of such places as hee hath taken, and left good Garrisons every where, finding no more Imperiall troops to drive out of <HI>Pomerania</HI> he went backe with his Armie, and having past the River of <HI>Oder,</HI> entred into the Dukedome of <HI>Meckelburgh,</HI> where comming unlooked for amongst the Imperialists, (that lye here and there enquartered, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive upon the Inhabitants, as their masters, having a better resolu∣tion to eat and drinke than to fight) he awakened them with his warlike Musicke of thundering Ordnance and Muskets, most un∣pleasing to them, and there made himselfe master of divers good places and Townes; as, <HI>Friedland, Brvndenberg,</HI> and <HI>Malchin</HI> all the Imperialists that are able to escape, flying away as fast as they can leaving every where their booties and goods, which they have these many yeeres robbed, behind them, unto their victorious enemies.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Tilly,</HI> he having written to the States of <HI>Silesia,</HI> requiring them to receive into their Country such Imperiall forces as hee would send thither, to bee enquartered there, and entertained by contribution untill winter should be past, (promising the number should not exceed 7000. men) and amplifying his Letters with many kind words; and complaints of the wants and miseries of the said Imperiall forces that came out of <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and other parts thereabouts, to move the said States to compassion; hee received for all that, for all answer, a round denyall, grounded upon impos∣sibilitie,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>the people in that Country being scarce able to live with those forces that are already lying upon them and whereof they did hope and expect to be freed very shortly, lest all might come to a ge∣nerall rebellion.</P>
<P><HI>Tilly</HI> himselfe hath appointed his generall <HI>Rendez-vous</HI> for the Imperiall Forces at <HI>Dessaw,</HI> and hath sent some troopes to <HI>Franck∣fort</HI> on the <HI>Oder:</HI> But there is small store of victuals and munition to be found for them; and therefore great discontentment amongst them.</P>
<P>Out of the Countries of <HI>Franconia, Suevia,</HI> and those parts, there are now marching many Imperiall troopes towards <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and from <HI>Lindaw</HI> there are sent that way 60. Waggons with Munition. But those Imperiall. Souldiers, having lived at ease, without any discipline, are very unwilling to march, where they shall be no lon∣ger commanders over the poore people, and therefore they runne a∣way where they can escape. The Commanders and Officers them∣selves seeme to have no great pleasure to goe; where they will bee forced to use rather their Weapons against the Enemy, than hither∣to they have done amongst those that could not withstand. I cannot expresse in words, how rigorously it is proceeded against those No∣bles and Gentlemen of <HI>Franconia,</HI> who either themselves or by some friends, brothers or fathers, have in time past served against the House of <HI>Austria:</HI> Their Lands, houses, and goods being daily ta∣ken from them, by such as come eyther with Commission or Let∣ters of the Emperour, that bestowed the same on them. So that whole Families, their wives and children, are driven out, to seeke where to live, being not suffered to take the least thing with them. The Lord comfort them, and all his distressed people.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from <HI>Francfort,</HI> the <HI>12.</HI> of February.</HEAD>
<P>THere is as yet no certainty, whether or no the Countries of <HI>Gu∣lick</HI> and <HI>Berghen</HI> shall be freed from the Troopes that lye there enquartered. The Paltsgrave of <HI>Newburgh</HI> is still at <HI>Bruxels,</HI> solli∣citing the Archdutchesse to give order for withdrawing the <HI>Spanish</HI> and Imperiall forces out of those Countries. But Count <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> who commands the Imperialists there (the same that was so long prisoner at <HI>Wesell</HI>) continueth in his resolution not to march with his forces from thence, unlesse he receive expresse Command∣ment from the Emperour. Meane while the Countries suffer pitiful∣ly, and are altogether ruinated.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<P>The thirteene Cantons of <HI>Switzerland</HI> have beene assembled at <HI>Baden,</HI> where they have beene a good while busied, to advise how to make an agreement betwixt those of <HI>Zurick</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Costance,</HI> and the Abbot of S. <HI>Gall,</HI> who both doe demand the resti∣tution of some Ecclesiasticall goods and Churches from those of <HI>Zu∣rick</HI> and <HI>Berne.</HI> But all that consultation came to nothing. The Pro∣testants there have resolved and united themselves so, that they will give no way to the pretences of those Romanists, notwithstanding the injuries and scornfull words, which daily the Papists Priests vt∣ter, both publikely and privately, and not without threatnings a∣gainst them.</P>
<P>The Protestant Princes and States, which remaine yet breathing in <HI>Germany,</HI> are now together at <HI>Leipsick,</HI> at which Towne the Ele∣ctor of <HI>Saxen</HI> arrived on the 4. of February last, with a Trayne con∣sisting of 700. horses. And on the same day there arrived also in person the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> accompanied with 250. horses. The Duke of <HI>Deuxponts,</HI> (a Prince Palatine that in time past was Ad∣ministrator at <HI>Heydelberg</HI>) being diverted by other occasions from comming himselfe, hath given his power and Commission to the Landgrave of <HI>Hessen.</HI> All the Protestant Imperiall Cities have sent their Deputies thither; and the Circle of <HI>Suevia</HI> likewise, as also the Nobility of <HI>Franconia.</HI> The two Dukes of <HI>Meckelburg,</HI> (not∣withstanding that they are proscribed by the Emperour, and that the Duke of <HI>Friedland</HI> hath long since taken their Countrey) having beene invited thither by the Elector of <HI>Saxen,</HI> are also there. So that now there is great expectation every where, what will be by them resolved and concluded.</P>

<HEAD>Extract out of another Letter of the <HI>15.</HI> of February.</HEAD>
<P>THe King of <HI>Sweden</HI> past on the 4. of February, <HI>stilo novo,</HI> over the Bridge at <HI>Stett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> with an Army consisting of about sixteene thousand men, horse and foot, and entred into the Dukedome of <HI>Meckelburg,</HI> where (as we receive good information) he hath taken many places of consequence, especially <HI>Matchin,</HI> and is come before <HI>Gustrow,</HI> which was the Princely seat of the Dukes of <HI>Meckelburg,</HI> and hath, since the taking of the said Country by <HI>Walstein</HI> (otherwise Duke of <HI>Friedland,</HI> to whom the Emperour gave that whole Duke∣dome) beene by him, both much fortified and much adorned, by many excellent Artificers, expressely sent thither; as Painters,
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>Gardners, Architects, &amp;c. The said Duke of <HI>Friedland</HI> intending to have there his Princely Court and residence.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath left (besides the Garrisons of such places as he hath taken in <HI>Pomerania</HI>) behinde him in the March of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> an Armie of 9000 men. And <HI>Tilly</HI> (not knowing what that King intended when he went backe from before <HI>Landsberg</HI>) gave order for the fortifying of a place called <HI>Beskou,</HI> and sent many troopes towards <HI>Franckfort</HI> on the <HI>Oder;</HI> which troopes doe there, and in all those parts where now they are, commit such insolencies, that it cannot be written: They destroy and spoile all; and although there is but small, or in some places no provision of victuals at all; yet whatsoever they finde, it they are not able to consume the same, or if it is not worth the carrying away, they doe spoile, burne, or other∣wise make it uselesse.</P>
<P>The Citie of <HI>Strasburg</HI> having, upon the summons which the Im∣periall Commissioners made, for the restitution of some Churches and Church-lands, refused to obey, must now already suffer the said Commissioners in three of their Villages, where the Ministers and Schoolmasters are commanded to avoyd these places: their Schooles and Churches are taken, and the Imperiall Armes (the Blacke Eagle) put upon the doores. How the people, or rather the Magistrate will disgest this, time will teach us.</P>
<P>The Citie of <HI>Franckfort</HI> (on the Maine) is also in danger, for ha∣ving refused to receive some Iesuites that came thither by the Com∣mission, they brought with them from the Duke of <HI>Baveere,</HI> and the Electors of <HI>Maints.</HI></P>
<P>We expect with great longing, what the Protestants will resolve at <HI>Leipsick,</HI> where the first proposition was ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on the 10. of <HI>Febr.</HI> but it is so secret, that I can tell you nothing more, but that we ra∣ther feare their feare, than hope for any generous designes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Extract of another Letter of the <HI>25.</HI> of February.</HEAD>
<P>IT is certaine that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath taken the good Towne of <HI>New-Brandenburgh,</HI> where there lay a Garrison of Imper alists, commanded by Colonell <HI>Marezan,</HI> who yeelded the said Towne by composition, and went out (delivering the same to that brave King) with six hundred Souldiers, with promise not to serve against the said King these three moneths.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>The nowes of this reddition being brought to <HI>Treptow,</HI> (ano∣ther good Towne in the Dukedome of <HI>Meckelberg,</HI> and also kept by an Imperiall Garrison) the Imperialists therein fearing to get not so good a condition, fled presently, and so left the Towne for the King, who being speedily advertised thereof, tooke the same also on the same day.</P>
<P>And we understand that besides these Townes, hee hath since ta∣ken <HI>Malchin, Malchow, Dammin, Garbaw,</HI> and other places: So that he is already master of all the Dukedome of <HI>Meckelburg,</HI> save onely foure (but principall good) Townes; being <HI>Wismar, Rostock, Butzow,</HI> and <HI>Damitz,</HI> which is a strong place, and lyeth upon the River of <HI>Elbe.</HI> What he intendeth now to doe, whether to besiege one of those Townes, or to goe towards <HI>Magdenburg,</HI> time must teach us: for his intentions are kept in his owne brest.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Tilly,</HI> we understand that he had gathered together eight thousand Imperialists, with whom he marched towards <HI>Branden∣burg,</HI> to hinder the said Kings comming towards <HI>Magdenburg.</HI></P>
<P>The Assembly of the Protestants began at <HI>Leipsick,</HI> and the first proposition hath beene made, but it is kept as yet so secret, that we cannot heare what it consists of.</P>
<P>It is written from thence, that amongst other Ambassadours and Deputies, there hath beene admitted an Ambassadour that came from the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and another (whom they call <HI>Monsieur de L'isle</HI>) from the French King. But it is much marvelled at, that the Cite of <HI>Hamburg</HI> hath not sent any Deputie thither, seeing <HI>Norim∣berg, Franckfort,</HI> &amp; divers other such Cities (who are now in greater danger than <HI>Hamburg,</HI> and have beene warned by divers Electors, and commanded by the Imperiall Commiss oners, not to send any Deputy thither) have notwithstanding sent their Deputies with full power and Commission.</P>
<P>Concerning the Countries of <HI>Gulick. Cleve,</HI> and <HI>Berghen,</HI> &amp;c. It is now certainely beleeved, that they shall bee freed from all the troopes that lye therein, both of the Spaniards, Imperialists, and the States: Her Highnesle the <HI>Infanta</HI> having published a Decree at <HI>Bruxels,</HI> bearing date the 19 of February last, whereby shee signifi∣eth, That upon their stance of the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> Her Highnesse doth grant unto the Innabitants to raze and breake downe all For∣tifications that of late have beene made in the said lands of <HI>Gulicke, Cleve, Bergh, Marcke, Ravenspergh</HI> and <HI>Ravenstein,</HI> except only the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>three places that are reserved. And concerning the withdrawing of all Forces and Souldiers in the said Countries, That she had gi∣ven order, that without saile, they all should be drawne out of their Garrisons on the fifth day of March, <HI>stilo novo,</HI> and shall bee carried quite out of the said Countries, (although the said new fortificati∣ons should not yet be razed) and carry with them onely their pro∣visions and Munitions that belong unto them, leaving behind what they found when they arrived: So that the Countries shall here∣after remaine free and neutrall; It being understood that the States shall likewise withdraw all their For∣ces out of the said Countries, &amp;c. Whe∣ther this hath been performed, we shall shortly heare.</P>

Nous ont empesché de jouir de la tranquilité que nous deui∣ons nous promettre auecraison; &amp; de procurer dans icellè le soulagement que nous desirions à nos subjetz, Recognoissant ce mal, qui nous à esté d'aurant plus sensible qu'il nous priue pour le present du fruict de nos soings &amp; de nos peins, qui n'ont autre fin que la descharge de nostre peuple que nous auons tousiours eu en l'Esprit comme le but de toutes nos a∣ctions, Nous n'auons rien cublié de tout ce qui nous à esté possible pour y apporter remede; Et par ce qu'on auoit aigry la Royne nostre tres-honorée Dame &amp; Mere, contre nostre tres-cher &amp; bien amé Cousin le Cardinall de Richelieu, Il ny a instance que nous n'ayons faicte, priere ny suplication

<P>We supposed we had cause to hope that those many trauels, which for certaine yeeres together we have continu∣ally undergone, for the good of this State, which God hath committed to our charge, should have beene well lik'd and seconded by all them that are about us: Notwithstanding we marvaile much, that ha∣ving brought downe the Rebellion of <HI>Rochell,</HI> and all other the Townes her adherents; re-established the Catholike Re∣ligion in all Provinces of our Realme, as also twice holpen our Allyes in <HI>Italy,</HI> and returned with such advantages as have put us in so good plight, that we need not envie any of our predecessors: That now certaine domesticall dissenti∣ons, plotted by the mischievous spirits of some particular men, whilst we were altogether busied in those important affaires whereof we have seene the successe; should hinder us from enjoying that tranquility, which with good reason we might expect, and from procuring thereby that good to our Subjects which we desire. Vnderstanding well this mis∣chiefe, which is so much the more sensible unto us, in that for the present it deprives us of the fruit of all our care and paines, which have never any other ends but the ease of our people, which we have continually in our heart, as the prin∣cipall scope of all our designes. Wee have forgot nothing which hath beene possible on our part to give remedy there∣to.
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>And because they have exasperated the Queene our most honoured Lady and Mother, against our deare and welbeloved Cousin the Cardinall of <HI>Richelieu:</HI> There re∣maines no intreaty which we have not made, nor prayer nor supplication which we have not used, nor any consideration publike nor private, which we have not set before her, to as∣swage her spirit: Our said Cousin likewise acknowledging his duty to her in all manner of respects, hath done whatever he could to satisfie her, submitting himselfe with all possible humility and all imaginable respects, to such Lawes as shee her selfe should be pleased to prescribe him; which we have likewise many times offered with our owne mouth: This re∣verence which he hath ever had towards her notwithstan∣ding, she hath divers times prayed and pressed us, that wee would thinke it good to remove him from the mannaging of our affaires, which the utility of his past services, and the in∣terest of our Authority would not so much as permit us to thinke of condescending unto. On the other side, wee have omitted nothing to give content to our most deare and wel∣beloved Brother the Duke of <HI>Orleans:</HI> insomuch that wee have granted unto them of principall ranke and place about him, (according to his owne desire) more meanes than the state of our Revenue could well beare: And of honours like∣wise, beyond that which with reason they could expect. Notwithstanding all these, they have perswaded him to leave the Court: Adjudging that a Personage of his birth and quality being departed from us, and at such time as the Queene our said Lady and Mother abode there not without testimony of discontent; it would be very hard for us (doe what we can) to bring our affaires to good issue, which wee propose for the prosperity and honour of this Kingdome, and the good of our Subjects; especially, considering the De∣signes which we have yet abroad. For which cause, after long patience, being arrived at this our Towne of <HI>Compeigne,</HI> to the end that the Queene (who of her selfe is wel-disposed)
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>being by this meanes sequestred from many bad spirits, may the better concur with us, by all just and reasonable meanes, to stop the course of Factions which arise in our State: which thing we have often prayed her by our principall Servants: notwithstanding she would not hearken thereto. We have therefore, to our great griefe, at last beene constrained to as∣say a more powerfull remedy for this mischiefe, which wee have found hitherto so refractorie to the most gentle Cures we could apply. And understanding that certaine of the Authors of these divisions doe yet continue to cherish them, we could not chuse but sequester some of them from our Court, and to separate our selfe for a while, though with paine unspeakeable, from the Queene our deare Mother, un∣till such time as her spirit be lenified, and she brought to con∣cur, with such sincerity as she hath hertofore done, to those Designes which we are to undertake hereafter, for the secu∣rity of this Kingdome from those mischiefes that threaten it now, at such time as it ought to reape the fruits of our labors: We hope that the goodnes of her nature will shortly reduce her spirit, and re-unite it unto us: Which wee beg of Al∣mighty God with all our heart, and that hee will blesse the good intentions which we have for this State, as he hitherto hath done.</P>

And furthermore, that remainder of those Spanish forces in <HI>J∣talie,</HI> may be brought together, and march toward the lower-Palatinate, there to be enquartered.

It seemes that whereas formerly, the resolution was to bring them downe toward the <HI>Donon,</HI> the same no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is altered; those Forces shall be employed against the League, contracted by the Protestant Princes and Peeres at <HI>Leypsich.</HI> Especially, for the defence of the smaller Townes, as <HI>Memming</HI> and the like. Which at this present are in great danger, and extreamly threat∣ned, if so be they would not yeeld themselves to that League, and receive some of the Protestant forces, that then they shall presently be attached. Hereupon the Imperialists doe not onely expect the rest of their forces, but also certaine thousands more
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>of <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> to ayd and assist them. Wherefore men in these parts are much troubled and perplexed, and take great care how to dispose of all their troupes, and where they shall become, and how they shall be billetted and enquartered. His Maj. the Emperour, hath forewarned us in these parts, not one∣ly to provide for the enquartering of those <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Forces, which are to come, and are now upon the march, but also to find quarter for 25000. other forces, which shall bee newly raised.</P>

To all and every our and the holy Em∣pires Electors, Princes, spirituall and temporall Prelates, Earles, Barons, Lords, Knights, Marshalls, Captaines, Maiors, Bailiffs, Iudges, Counsellors, Citizens, Communal∣ties, and to all and every our and the Empires Subjects: But more particularly to all Commanders, Colonels, Captaines both of horse and foot, Ensignes, Lievtenants, and to all other Officers, and generally to all Soldiers both foot and horse, of what nation, dignity and condition soever, and in what scr∣vice (out of our Armies) soever they are or may be, unto whom these our Patents and Commandements, or a true copy thereof (which we will have beleeved and obeyed as the Ori∣ginall it selfe) shall appeare, We hereby doe signifie, Wheras by Letters dated the fourth of <HI>April</HI> last the Elector and Duke of <HI>Saxen</HI> hath given us notice of a conclusion made by the E∣lectors, States, Counsellors, Ambassadours, Deputies, and Commissioners of such Protestants as were absent, lately as∣sembled at <HI>Leipsick,</HI> the strangenesse whereof hath much mo∣ved and filled with displeasure our Imperiall heart, since that the said Electors, Princes and States have agreed and bound themselves, quite contrary to our admonitions sent before to the said electour of <HI>Saxen,</HI> under pretext of an order of Exe∣cution of the Circles, to make a dangerous preparation of Warre; and, without any signification of their number and de∣signes, make now already (as from divers parts we are adver∣tised) in severall Circles, and particularly in our Imperiall Ci∣ties great levies: And whereas it is easie to presume, that at this perillous constitution of the Empire, where the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> is entered as an enemy and having already taken whole <HI>Pomerany,</HI> a part of the Mark of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and some places <HI>Mecke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>burg,</HI> will daily proceede, and incite other forraine forces to doe much: Where the rebellious Towne of <HI>Mag∣denburg</HI> is not yet brought to obedience, and where many old dangers doe yet appeare; such a dangerous beginning and in∣tent would tend to hinder (and as it were to bereave us of) all
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>meanes to maintaine the Warres, now so requisite for the de∣fence and necessity of the holy Empire and States thereof; it would further and advantage the power of the enemies; cause yet a greater confusion, troubles and evils, and withall a farre greater mistrust and hatred amongst this Nation: Yea (un∣lesse it be with all speed withstood) it would bring into the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Empire of the <HI>German</HI> Nation (our deare Coun∣try) a new unquenchable fire whereby the same (which these 800 yeeres hath most sweetly flourished) would now at once bee consumed to ashes and wholly overthrowne. Therefore we knowing that our duty requires that, as <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour we doe prevent all such threatning evills, and that such agree∣ments and unions are not to be made nor suffered without the knowledge, consent and pleasure of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour, who we are, but that they are quite contrary unto the Laws, orders and constitutions of the Empire, and the dehortations and admonitions made by us being prohibited under great and grievous punishments, so that wee intend by no meanes to suffer the same. We doe hereby admonish, will and com∣mand you and every of you, and our expresse will, pleasure and commandement is, that you doe not give nor permit any place of <HI>Rendez-vous</HI> unto my troopes or souldiers, that are, may or might be levied on the behalfe of the said agreement and conclusion made at <HI>Leipsick;</HI> Neither grant any of them passage or passe whatsoever, but rather where any shall be met or found, that you beat, destroy, disperse and kill them, as you will answer the contrary at your perils of the punishments expressed in the constitutions of the Empire. And most ear∣nestly we doe require and command you the Colonels, I is vte∣nants Captaines, Ensignes Commanders, and all other Offi∣cers both of horse and foot, and all soldiers of what name, con∣dition and quality soever they are or may be, that already are received and entred, or shall yet enter into service of the said preparation and agreement made at <HI>Leipsick,</HI> against our knowledge, will and pleasure, and against our deho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tations, and the Lawes and Rights of the Empire; and more particu∣larly all those that in any way are subject unto us and the holy Empire upon paine and perils comprehended in the said Im∣periall constitutions, and upon paine to lose all the priviledges,
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>favours, rights, lands, possessions, and also all rights of Com∣panies, Cities and birth; And such others as are not subject to us nor the Empire, upon paine of death, when and wheresoe∣ver they shall be apprehended. Wee most earnestly and ex∣presly command, to give over and forsake all such service, and in time to come never to returne or enter into the same with∣out our knowledge and permission, under what pretext or colour soever they be required or may be induced: And that you make no excuse of your stay by reason of the oath you may or might be sworne and bound by, since the same in this con∣stitution of time is without force I and we doe hereby and by vertue of our Imperiall power discharge and free you of: And if there should be found some amongst you the said Colo∣nels, Captaines, Ensignes, and other Officers and common sol∣diers of horse or foot, that have entered into any service ei∣ther at home in their owne Country, or abroad amongst the troopes of strangers, they and every of them, that in obedi∣ence to this our Imperiall commandement doe or shall returne from that their service unto our troopes, there to serve us and the Empire, and bring their attestations from our Officers, shall have a generall and speciall pardon, and be received a∣gaine into our Imperiall grace. And we will and command withall you the said Electors, Princes and States, lately thus ar∣rived at <HI>Leipsick,</HI> not to charge or lay upon your vassals, te∣nants inhabitants, burgers and subjects (in all and every your Countryes, Dominions, Cities, and also all Imperiall Townes and Dominions) any contribution, taxe or subsidy for and on the behalfe of your said levies intended and made against our will and contrary to the constitutions of the Empire; Com∣manding withall, if any such imposition and contribution is or should be required, all you the vassals, tenants, burgers, in∣habitants and subjects aforesaid upon the like and afore men∣tioned paine and upon perill to lose all priviledges, rights, and freedomes above ment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oned, not to pay or to deliver the said contribution, but rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o remaine constant and faithfull in those duties you owe to us, as <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour and Su∣preme head of the hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Empire, and also to shew all fa∣vour and furtherance to him that bringeth this our Imperiall and expresse commandement, that the same may without any

<HEAD>Extract of severall fresh Letters written out of <HI>Germany.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe cruelty used by the Imperialists at the taking of <HI>Mag∣denburg</HI> (the like no History hath nor could ever make mention of) had indeed troubled many Protestants in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> especially the Elector of <HI>Saxen</HI> found himselfe much perplexed upon the newes thereof, when he likewise was much troubled and urged by an Imperiall Ambassadour and many other Messengers and letters, both from the Emperour and other Catholike Electors and Princes. Howsoever seeing by the example of <HI>Magdenburg</HI> what he and others of his Profession and Religion have to looke for at their enemies hands and promises, and considering the Imperiall Mandates and Proclamations, published (like a thunder) against the con∣clusion lately taken by him and other Protestant Princes and States assembled at <HI>Leipsick;</HI> and hearing withall of the doubt and feare divers made of his constancie in the said resolution, he both gave order for the greater speed in the levying of his owne forces and sent also severall Messengers to other Prote∣stant Princes, States and Imperiall Cities, with ample letters, whereby he doth not onely assure them of his constancie and proceeding in the performance of their resolution, But ex∣horteth them also, to make greater haste and to take more care than some of them did hitherto to prepare and defend themselves, representing the great necessity and danger, their enemies extraordinary arming, threatnings and executions would else bring them into. These
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>letters of his have very much rejoyced and strengthened all the good party, especially <HI>Norimberg, Strasburg</HI> and other good Townes, the most part whereof are already well provided and armed. But <HI>Memming</HI> lying some what aside and feeling already those Imperiall forces as came and yet daily come out of <HI>Jtaly</HI> (which amount to some six or seven thousand thereabouts) neere them, they feare (as being neerest to the danger) the execution might beginne at their Towne, howbeit they have as yet and doe still refuse any fur∣ther contribution and admittance of an Imperiall Garrison, where formerly they were subject unto.</P>

<P><HI>Tilly</HI> marches with an armie of 25000. men up into <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> either into the Dukedome of <HI>Wimar,</HI> as some thinke, or else towards the Country of <HI>Hessen</HI> (as is most likely) there to de∣feat the forces of the Circle of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> who have there their <HI>Rendezvous,</HI> and part whereof have lately defeated some of those Imperiall tsoops that <HI>Tilly</HI> had sent to hinder their said <HI>Reudezvous.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> (having firmed a royall Campe, since the Elector of <HI>Saxen</HI> did not grant him for his surety and re∣treate the Towne of <HI>Wittenberg</HI> to put his Garrison into, nor passage through his Country) expecteth more forces out of <HI>Prussia</HI> and from other parts; meane while he hath an armie in <HI>Silesia</HI> to which he hath sent some troopes for reinforcing and the better to oppose them all against the <HI>Jmperialists</HI> that in∣tend to besiege <HI>Crossen.</HI></P>
<P>Some of his Caualrie met lately with five Companies of Crabates that came out of <HI>Magdenburg</HI> laden with very rich booty they made there, which five Companies were all defea∣ted, and left all their riches (as if they had expresly fetched the same) unto the <HI>Swedish</HI> troopes.</P>
<P>The like good fortune befell lately to the Garrison of <HI>Wesell,</HI> who met with a convoy that carried much money towards the <HI>Spanish</HI> Camp, which convoy being also beaten left all the money behinde them in their enemies hands.</P>

<P>Our souldiers of <HI>Wesell</HI> and the neere adjoyning Garrisons 160 strong, have defeated a Convoy which was going from <HI>Culin</HI> to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> they were conducted by those of <HI>Rhynberk</HI> &amp; <HI>Orsoy,</HI> &amp; were set upon by our men neere about <HI>Deuren.</HI> In which exploit our soldiers obtained great booty 150000 Rix∣do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lers in specie, much Silke &amp; other rich commoditie, swhere∣with divers Carts were laden. The rest of the bootie besides the readie Coine doth amount to the summe of 250000 Rix∣dollers, this bootie they brought into <HI>Wesell</HI> last Sunday in the vening and 60 or 70 serviceable horses, and 2 Ensignes. The spanish soldiers fled all of them, onely the waggoners, and some other labouring men opposed our men, and killed 3 or 4 of them, but there was no meanes for them to prevaile.</P>
<P>The Governour, Chancellour, &amp; Councell of the Province of <HI>Geldria,</HI> and the Earldome of <HI>Zutphen</HI> have prescribed a ge∣nerall day of meeting, the 17 of <HI>Iune</HI> at <HI>Nimmegen,</HI> where the whole countrie is to appeare.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>12.</HI> of <HI>Iune</HI> from the Army of his Excellence the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Whereas his Excell the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> had pitcht Armie at the side of the River <HI>Ley</HI> before the Citie <HI>Bridges</HI> the 3 of moneth, each one thought that his Excellence was of intenti∣on to approach &amp; besiege the said Citie. But now it appeares probably that his Excel. was not so minded, for he did not en∣trench himselfe there, but lay with his Army in the field onely. In the meane while certaine Committees were sent out of the said Citie in the name of the 4 parts of Flanders to treat with his Excellēce concerning the contribution which was behind and had long time beene unpayd, insomuch that they gave se∣curitie for entire payment of 10 yeares contribution. Where∣upon his Excell with his whole Army departed, and the verie same night tooke his resting place at <HI>Maldegom,</HI> where we pas∣sed the 5 of <HI>Iune</HI> over the river <HI>Lieve</HI> towards <HI>Walichem</HI> and from thence toward <HI>Eckelo,</HI> and <HI>Caprick,</HI> and the 7 of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>une re∣turned backe with our whole armie at <HI>Watervliet,</HI> where his Excell. instantly caused retrenchments to be cast up all along the <HI>Holland Dike,</HI> for the better ensuring of his armie, so that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>case the spanish forces (which as wee understood had continu∣ally followed us) had come upon us, then had we taken the said Dike for our defence.</P>
<P>The 8 of <HI>Iune</HI> the provision of his Excell, was embarqued, and his horse troopes, being commanded presently as soone as they should be landed to march toward <HI>Berg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nop Zoome.</HI> Ye∣sterday were all the Land, forces shipt, and all the waggons put aboard. The sirelockes in the meane time stood in battle array, and held the watch untill all things were safely embarqued. Thus with the whole traine of our armie wee marched from <HI>Ysenayck</HI> to <HI>Ramm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kens,</HI> &amp; so downwards, sayling many hun∣dred shippes together, &amp; so forsooke the <HI>Flemish coasts,</HI> which country in this our expedition wee have wholly brought un∣der contribution untill the verie Citie <HI>Geudt.</HI> His Excellence in this expedition had a verie vigilant regard over his whole armie and a speciall care that all things might be carried verie orderly insomuch that hee caused many of his soldiers to bee hanged for their misdemeanours and insolencies committed against the inhabitants of the Countrie: But the like care was not taken on the other side, for many of our soldiers which did straggle somewhat out of their limits had by them their No∣ses and Eares cut off. Three soldiers wives with a child of 8 yeares were taken by the Flemish and hanged.</P>
<P>The same day that we came to <HI>Watervliet,</HI> the spanish that night arrived at <HI>Caprick,</HI> but did not shew themselves any neerer unto us So that in this enterprize, wee have not met with our enemie to any purpose, and have found no resistance worthy of relation. Onely wee were informed that the ene∣mie brought his whole armie together, therewith intending to cut off all passages from our armie and hinder the victualls from comming to us.

<P>The armie of his Excellence the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is returned againe out of Flaunders into these parts. Before this Citie are many ships laden with Ordnance, Munition, provision and all warlike necessaries: Most of the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsemen were landed at <HI>Geer∣truydenbergh,</HI> &amp; presently hasted thence to <HI>Oosterh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut, Gilsen</HI> &amp; other villages about <HI>Breda.</HI> The foot forces sayle all of them

<P>The countrie people in the countrie of <HI>Hensden</HI> and <HI>Alte∣na,</HI> flye with all their goods and moveables from their country habitations into the Cities.
