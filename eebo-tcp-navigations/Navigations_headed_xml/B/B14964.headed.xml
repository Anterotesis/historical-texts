<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here is nothing that makes men more commenda∣ble before the face of Heauen and Earth, in compa∣rison of true fidelity towards God and their Prince. It is a Primitive vertue which is borne with vs, and ought not to die but with vs without prejudice or wrong to any forraine Nations, it may bee averr'd with preemi∣nence of honour, that there is not any place or Nation, where the Divine worship is more religiously observed, the Churches better maintayned and served, the Cleargy more exemplary, the Nobi∣lity more pious, the people more devout and observant in reli∣gious duties, than in those Provinces of the Low-countries which are subject and obedient to his Majesty.

<P>Wee are under a King the best that ever bore Crowne in many ages, the most pious, and best affectioned unto his sul stitutes and such as are in authority under him. At this day when Piety &amp; Re∣ligion are so lively opposed &amp; set? upon in his Person and States by impiety and heresie, when God and our Prince are both assaulted at once, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e every man is now putting to his helping hand in the Ship untill the tempest be overpast, you will not (I assure my selfe) wonder if among a multitude and infinite number of good men, you shall find one wicked faithlesse servant, who turnes his backe to his Master, and kissing him betrayes him, wonder not I say, if among so many faithfull ones you meet with one who under pretence of a Patriot and faithfull supporter of the Countryes, opens a way to easement.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<P>Our enemies are so much the more dangerous, by how much more they doe flatter vs. And as the promise of liberty of con∣science is nothing else but an Introduction of heresie: So is the other of publike liberty tendered by the hand of a disloyall one, no∣thing else but a deceitfull bayte to replunge our Provinces into the fore-passed calamities, out of which the mercy of the Omnipotent hath delivered and brought vs forth. Our sweetnesse (GOD bee blessed) is not mixed with any bitternesse, our Sacrifices are not intertu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bed or troubled, our lives passe along in tranquility, and under the manifold blessings of Heaven, under the example and government of a Princesse most devout and debonayre, and hope and expectation of a young Prince of Royall race. What is there now wanting to the height of our happinesse, but the accomplish∣ment of a Peace, which cannot be with-held from us, if wee make but some tryall and proofe worthy of our zeale and good will? We can doe much, if wee have but the will: onely let us have this care, that the want of courage turne not to our reproach &amp; shame, since that our domesticke enemies are discryed &amp; brought to light, those without shalbe inferiour to us. Our domesticke enemies are such, who under colour and pretence of raysing up the publike liberty, labour and endeavour to destroy it by inovation, and bury the same in their owne ambitious engrossing. And who having no other Religion but that of their ambition and of their owne inte∣rest, doe neverthelesse make profession of being very good Catho∣lickes.</P>
<P>The worst cause that ever was in the world wanted not some pretence or other. There is nothing so like unto an Angell of light as a <HI>Daemon</HI> or Devill, nothing doth so counterfeyte, and appeare like unto the truth as falshood &amp; a lye. You have (my Lords) seene the ridiculous pretences of Count <HI>Henry de Bergh</HI> in those Letters which hee hath sent to her highnesse, to the States of the Coun∣trey, and the declaration which he made to sollicite the fidelity of soldiers and men of honour. You have seene I say, his foundation without foundation, upon the which he grounds his perverse in∣tentions. But the dislike and distast which you have taken against his proceedings hath beene such, and your loyalty and fidelity so commendable, that even to convince his felony, you have (with an
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>extraordinary affection, &amp; love to the good of the Countrey) con∣tributed unto the Prince farre greater ayde and helpe than former∣ly you had done. Moreover it is necessary that besides you, the world be satisfied, which oftentimes doth judge by the outward appearance, not knowing the truth of things, and that the same may see the truth discovered, lest men be abused by the cunning slights and pretences where withall he hides the grossenesse and basenesse of his treason. He begins his letter written to her high∣nesse with insupportable and boldnesse without measure, presen∣ting most traytour-like bread in one hand, and a flinty stone in the other. He exposeth his wicked designes with all submission. Never I am sure, was there any rebellion declared with more shameles∣nesse and impudency. After this his fayned Ceremony and com∣plement, he <HI>complaineth, that the Souldiers were withdrawne from his government, to the end that they might make him be the cause of their destruction.</HI> It is lawfull for a man to make his complaint but not perfidious. That which he sayes is not truth, and the Letters of the Marquise <HI>De Sancte Croes</HI> doe testifie as much for he required no men from him, <HI>but onely beacuse he judged that the enemy would at∣tempt nothing on that side, leaving all to his owne choise and desiring him to see the Bridge well guarded and provided before</HI> Venlo, <HI>to suf∣fer the troupes to passe over safely which should be seat to relieve the same.</HI> And put the case, that which he affirmeth were true, if hee had beene well minded, and his intention good, he ought to have defended her government to the last man, and have kept himselfe in the City of <HI>Gelder</HI> which is a strong place, (as he had promised by Letters to her highnesse, and allowing that <HI>Venlo</HI> was able to be held) &amp; therein have imitated the generosity of his Brother Count <HI>Frederick,</HI> who in the yeare 1597. defended himselfe within the City <HI>Lingen,</HI> even to the extreamity, with onely three Companies of foote and one of Horse. But this, two dayes before the enemie did come before <HI>Venlo,</HI> called the Magistrates and told them, that the city would soon be besieged, &amp; to take away the courage from the Citizens demonstrated unto them the small appearance and hope he had of defending the same. Wherefore hee excused him∣selfe from protecting of them, nay and besides this being Gover∣nour of that Province, said he had other places to guard &amp; looke to,
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>neverthelesse he presently made hast unto the City <HI>Gelder,</HI> from whence he departed presently accompanied onely with one ser∣vant, or Companion, &amp; betooke himselfe to <HI>Liege,</HI> there to put in execution the perfidiousnesse which he had plodded a long time.</P>
<P>As <HI>for his service of forty yeares,</HI> which he mentions: Tis true, in the beginning they were considerable, and of some worth when his brother (whose death he doth alleadge) did animate him by their good and valerous examples. But ever since, from the yeare 1606 that he defended the City <HI>Groll</HI> with expectation of reliefe by the Marquise <HI>Spinola</HI> who came time enough to rescue him, his services have not beene so remarkeable nor of such moment, and moreover they have beene recompenced an hundred fold with dignities and titles, gifts, and honourable charges, and excessive summes of Money.</P>
<P>As for <HI>the ill government of the Countryes,</HI> and the progresse of our enemies, that proceeds from nothing else but from the mani∣fold treacheries, and the to too much confidence and trust which our Princes have in his person, having with a fatherly and favoura∣ble affection which they bare unto their servants, indured a long time his discontentments, and greevances, which in time by little and little, and more and more are still degenerated unto this action the most base and ignoble that ever could bee returned with re∣proach unto a reasonable Soule, manifested in these two branches, ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atitude, and revolt.</P>
<P>One of the first testimonies of his disloyall and evill will which he cunningly concealed, was observed at <HI>Bergen on Zoom</HI> in the yeare 1622. for then and here having received command reitera∣ted by her Highnesse, to conduct the Marquise <HI>Spinola</HI> with all di∣ligence unto the Army which he than had on the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> hee made a thousand excuses to prolong the time, and stay him or keepe him backe untill the want of reliefe caused us to rayse the siege. And it was told the Marquise than, (who was in travaile with im∣patiency, during this delay) by the Lieutenant of the Artillery, <HI>Wyn∣gart</HI> by name, that he would loose his head, if Count <HI>Henry de Bergh</HI> (whom he had knowne by long experience) did arriue, before the occasion should be let slip.</P>
<P>He thought to have played the same prancke two yeares after,
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>in like manuer to divert the siege of <HI>Breda,</HI> making profer of an en∣terprise upon <HI>Ravensteyn,</HI> afterward upon the <HI>Grave,</HI> and lastly up∣on the Castle of <HI>Genepe.</HI> The cunning Letters which after his sub∣tile manner he wrote full of excuses, have sufficiently discovered what was his designe. They are printed at large, in the history of the siege of <HI>Breda,</HI> composed and set forth by Father <HI>Hermanus Hugo.</HI></P>
<P>The confidence which her Highnesse had euer since in his fide∣lity for the releeuing of <HI>Groll.</HI> In the yeare 1627. was the cause why wee lost that City. For being there was a difference risen betweene two Maisters of the Campe, for the vantguard, being of different Nations, hee instead that hee should haue rid them out of the Field, and done as it befitted him for his Maiesties service, hee counsels the one not to yeild to the other, by that meanes in the meane time, to prevent them both from defeating a Convoy which eased and refreshed the Enemie, for want of which Con∣voy the Enemie must of necessity haue raised the siege. Hee was put to his excuse, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quitted because his authority was not great enough for the deciding the preeminence of Nations, But let vs see, if hee hath better be haued himselfe when hee had receiued more authority. The City named <HI>Shortogenbosch,</HI> was besieged by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in the yeare of our Lord 1629. Wee than praised God, because the Enemie was fallen before a City which was able to defend it selfe and hold out vntill releife should come. Her Highnesse at that time vsed so much diligence, that in few dayes wee had a most flourishing Army on Foote and able to make a strong assault. There was onely question made, who should command the same, the Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> than being absent. In the end this was the resolution that Count <HI>Henry de Bergh</HI> should haue the honour, and to this end hee was sent for by her Highnesse. No sooner was hee come to <HI>Bruxels,</HI> but hee be∣gan to propound an hundred difficulties one after another, and frame excuses, to the end that the Enemie might gaine the more time to fortifie themselues. In these extremicies, and by reason of the confidence which wee had in him, and partly by reason of his experience nothing was denied him which hee demanded. Many dayes passed in these entermedlings, but in the end hee
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>goes to Field, and was by the way (so great hast he made) from the 3. of <HI>June</HI> to the 27. and than hee found that the besieged had not yet lost one Inch of ground of all their outworkes, although the quarters of the Enemie were in good reasonable defence. The advice of the most part of the Colonels was to open Trench a∣gainst trench, and weary out the enimie in such sort, that hee should not bee able to disquiet the besieged, and so expect vntill the Autumne should bee past, and than the waters would cause him to depart of his owne accord, or at the leastwise bee con∣strained to forsake some quarter or other, by which meanes wee might haue a way opened to bring in Munition, and soldiers and necessaries, as much as should be required for the deliuerance of the City. Count <HI>Henry</HI> cannot approue this enterprise, indeed hee made tryall of some others, in those places which were most fortified, and contented himselfe with this conclusion, that the Enemies trenches were not possible to bee entred. Hauing there∣fore intended a diuersion of his Army hee leaues the siege, and sends to hazard the passage of the <HI>Yssel,</HI> by <HI>Lucas Cayro,</HI> who ha∣uing passed happily, hee followed him, and ioynes the Imperi∣all Army with theirs, which Army was come for our aid and re∣liefe. And what doth hee than? hee begins to treat with the Burgomaisters of Cities, onely to replenish his owne Coffers, and famish the fairest and compleatest Army which had beene seene in a long time, in stead of demanding vp those places where there were neither soldiers nor munition, and which doubtlesse would haue surrendred at the very sight of a stock of a tree, or the smal∣lest and simplest stroake which could haue beene made at them.</P>
<P>You shall obserue, if you please, an excusable perfidiousnesse. When <HI>Lucas Cayro</HI> had passed the <HI>Yssell.</HI> Contrary to the opinion of Count <HI>Henry,</HI> and that the terrour of an explioct so newly put in practice, and not foreseeene had astonished all <HI>Holland.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> hauing assembled the whole Councell, and pro∣pounded vnto them what had so lately and vnexpectedly happe∣ned, put into deliberation whether the siege should bee raysed yea or no. The aduice and opinion of all the Councell, and each of them was, that the <HI>Veluwee</HI> being thus occupied and possessed vnexpectedly, the Cities of <HI>Arnheym, Amersfort, Doesburgh,
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>Wageningen, Rhenen,</HI> and other neare adioyning places about the <HI>Veluwee</HI> would bee taken without any resistance at all, and that the gaine and profit which they should make of <HI>Shertogenbosch</HI> could not countervaile nor recompence the least of all those los∣ses, which they should suffer elsewhere, if their enimie were per∣mitted to ceaze vpon the very heart of the Country. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> did very much commend the advice of these Counsel∣lors, and said, that verily some course must bee taken, if that which they obiected must needs fall out so, but hee could assure them to the contrary, and that the event would proue otherwise. And from whom I pray, could he haue this knowledge and assu∣rance but from Count <HI>Henry De Bergh,</HI> who in effect neuer made so much as any shew of demanding vp any City. Who within his owne view permitted the City <HI>Desburgh</HI> to be revictualled, and that was the cause that some poore <HI>Hollanders</HI> were executed being Catholicks, because they had declared and manifested the intelligence which hee had receiued from them priuately. In a word <HI>Shertogenb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch</HI> was not releiued, and in effect nothing could be expected on his part since he had engaged himselfe by promise to his sisters not to reseue the same.</P>
<P>What water can wash him cleare from the losse of <HI>Wesel,</HI> which was taken from vs at the same time? seeing that as soone as euer he heard of the newes, hee kept himselfe shut vp in his Chamber for 24. houres together, for feare least hee should bee required to send help to recouer the same City; and when as Count <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Nassau</HI> hauing intreated him to furnish him with men, to re∣gaine that place, before the open breach where the Enemie en∣tred, was made vp, hee refused it. The Gouernour of <HI>Diden</HI> hath spoken it to Count <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Nassau</HI> with his owne mouth that if hee had come to releiue the City of <HI>Wesell</HI> any time within fiue dayes after the same was taken hee might haue entred without a∣ny difficulty. If Count <HI>Henry</HI> had beene an honest man, wee had finished our warre that yeare, and the Catholicke Religion, (with which cloake hee hides his basenesse, and the blacknesse of his Hypocrisie) had neuer suffered so much as the same hath done e∣uer since.</P>
<P>What wonders hath hee wrought? where are the great ex∣ploicts
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>of his Conquests? Let this also moreouer bee spoken for <HI>the great seruices</HI> which hee alleageth in Generall. Hee himselfe hath oftentimes avouched, that he neuer hath receiued wound or hurt in the Kings seruice (notwithstanding that some Histories and report would haue made him beleeue that hee was once hurt in the leg or thigh, in a skirmish neere vnto <HI>Ruremond</HI> in the yeare 1598.) which hee attributed to a Mandegloire, or little figure or shape of a man, which hee ordinarily carried in a small box, very durty and foule, which he hath shewed to more than one person.</P>
<P>Indeed his seruices are well knowne, if euer any mans were; hee entred very poore into the service of our Princes, and now at this instant hee is so rich that he possesseth millions. From a par∣ticular Horseman, and meanest of his house, hee was advanced to the greatest offices which any servant of his Maiesty could aspire vnto. And therefore hee hath great reason to say, <HI>that the Nobi∣lity is not in that esteeme as they ought to bee;</HI> seeing that the Ho∣nours, Offices, and Dignities are so ill bestowed; and that hee a∣lone doth possesse that, which a dozen others better deseruing than himselfe would esteeme themselues happy to enioy. God bee thanked there are none that are vnprovided, and not one who hath just cause to complaine.</P>
<P>Are they not farre engaged and employed in the house, and ser∣vice of their Soueraigne? Doe not they hold the most part of the Gouernments? Who doe possesse the principall Offices, and Ecclesiasticall Dignities but those of the Low-Countryes? If the <HI>Spanish, whom Count Henry vpbraides to bee the sole Gouernours</HI> haue any part in the Government, and charge, it is for to expose their liues for our preseruation, and proceeds from the great care which the King hath for our protection. Which this new refor∣mator qualifies with the name of <HI>Domination,</HI> intending thereby to make the same odious.</P>
<P>Those of the Country in particular, and those of other nations, who vnanimously liue in service here, and brotherly one with another, haue their part in the cheifest charges and offices as well as the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> hath bad the Generalship both by Sea and Land; and at this present the Generalship both
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>of the Cavallery and Artillerye, are not possessed by the <HI>Spanish.</HI> Wee haue seene those of these Countryes reciprocally in the Councels of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and the managing of the most important matters: And wee haue such still at this present. Our disconten∣ted Count <HI>Henry</HI> contradicts himselfe, hee doth not remember that in his letter full of sedition which hee wrote vnto the Stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of these Countryes, hee confesseth that hee was called vpon by the King, to bee imployed in great affaires.</P>
<P>The Nobility than is not in so small esteeme as hee would make the world beleeue, and his complaints are altogether without ground and foundation full of contradictions, seeing that he him∣selfe hath beene honoured with the command of being Generall of the Army, when the <HI>Spanish,</HI> and other Nations haue beene ex∣cluded therefrom. It is hee himselfe that hath lost some of the Nobility. The Prince of <HI>Chimay,</HI> and the Baron <HI>De Belvoire,</HI> who haue beene displeased at their very death, seeing the King be∣trayed by his <HI>Monopolies,</HI> will one day acouse and reproach him before the throne of God, of the losse of twentie thousand good men, which hee caused to languish in Misery, to the end hee might vse the Kings Enemies gently, who did contribute great summes of money to satisfie his <HI>Avarice.</HI> The Father <HI>Hermanus Hugo,</HI> did in the Army reproach him at the very point of death, and could not survive the publick Calamity.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Frederick</HI> his Brother shall accuse him in like manner &amp; lay as much to his charge, for being so slack and remisse, and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sing all occasion of releeuing the most Catholick City of <HI>Sherto∣genbosch,</HI> which that Generous Cavallier hath formerly deliuered (in the yeare 1604) from the siege of Graue <HI>Maurice,</HI> who had blocqued vp the same. Let therefore Count <HI>Henry</HI> blame his owne insatiable couetousnesse for disorder, and attribute the ill gouerment to himselfe, without the which wee might at this day reioyce in a most happy and honourable peace, assuredly euen such a peace which good subjects ought to wish vnto their Prince for the reputation of his Crowne.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Commission of Master of the Field Generall, which hee saith was conferred vpon him two yeares agoe, by her Highnesse in the name of the Kings Maiesty, and which hee is now resolued to ex∣ercise

How doth hee pay and recompence our good and vertu∣ous Princesse with ingratitude? How doth hee accuse her of Conniuance saying, <HI>that hee knowes that she wisheth that the affaires went better?</HI> And as it were acknowledging the goods deedes, and supreme honours which hee hath receiued from her extreame goodnesse and bounty, hee hath so much boldnesse and audacity to take her for a prote trix of his mischiefe, and so doth declare himselfe openly to bee guilty, as now hee is proclaimed. <HI>To bee guilty of crimen laesae Maiestatis in the highest degree,</HI> and capitall Enemie of the publike rest, and therefore consequently fallen away, and deprived of all his Honours, offices, Dignities, and in∣terest which hee hitherto hath had in his Maiesties service.</P>
<P>In the yeare 1484. the Count <HI>de Rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt</HI> did by the like prac∣tice bare Armes against the Arch-Duke <HI>Maximilian</HI> his Lord, &amp; attributing in like manner to himselfe the title of Captaine Gene∣rall of the Prince <HI>Philip</HI> his sonne, hee wrote in this sort to the States generall assembled in the City of <HI>Bruxels,</HI> his answer gi∣uen him was this. That they did not acknowledge him for such, but an Enemie of the Prince and of the state.</P>
<P>As for the Countryes, in the name of God let him leaue them in peace, for there is no need of forging any innouation, wee need no broiles nor Traitor to trouble our tranquility. The flock would bee in good case vnder the clawes of the Wolfe, if our Religion had no better Protector. Oh had but this blacke soule as much capacity, and ability as hee hath hatred and malice, wee should soone see a strange Religion, and such Lawes, that <HI>Saturue</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter</HI> would not bee brought in but for them onely. I cannot con∣ceiue how a man that hath no Religion at all: who hath falsified his Faith, and who in the yeare 1621. when hee went before <HI>Iulliers,</HI> by Testament written by his owne hand, which hee left to his sister <HI>Anne,</HI> did ordaine to bee bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed or enterred in a prophane place neerer vnto his sisters, will not onely cloake and cover himselfe with a vaile of Religion, but also counterfeite
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>himselfe to bee a protector of the Catholike, Apostolicall, and <HI>Romish.</HI></P>
<P>You deceiue your selfe Monsieur Count <HI>Henry,</HI> you must not send your manifestations and declarations into your Government of <HI>Geldria,</HI> hereof your Conscience is to well knowne there, the City of <HI>Stefenswert,</HI> which you haue made neutrall to serue for a retreat vnto the Enemies of the King, and to the Hereticks, and where you haue brought the Ministers to poison the people and instruct your Sisters <HI>Anne,</HI> and <HI>Charloite,</HI> these shall testifie of your carriages, and your secret behaviour. Doe not you remem∣ber that sometimes by chaunce and through forgetfullnesse you left a little haereticall prayer booke in high-dutch on a seate in the Iesuitish Church at <HI>Ruremond.</HI> Which booke you called your <HI>Haureman?</HI> you haue written to Priests and other persons well qualified, and of diuers Nations, that your sisters were christianly deceased, and that their soules were very happy. In the meane while you know, that they gaue vp the ghost in the Armes of such Ministers which you had procured them. Wee know more of your newes than you doe thinke for.</P>
<P>Hee ends his letter with <HI>the retreat which hee had made into the City of</HI> Liege <HI>for the advancement of his desseyns.</HI> Wherein his sub∣tiltye ill compacted together is failing; for the Deputes of the Prince and States of <HI>Liege,</HI> not willing to prejudice any way to so good neighbourhood, haue disclaimed his action by a decree. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>une</HI> the 23. the contents whereof are these. <HI>A declaration published to shew that his letters and his declaration haue bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e published with∣out any knowledge of theirs or participation, and consent, and that they intend in no wise to entermeddle with any affaires of the said Count Henry.</HI> Nay, for their better Iustification, they haue obliged him by a writing of his owne hand the 25. day of <HI>June.</HI> That they would haue it manifested. That as hee had published the said let∣ters without hauing given notice or asked permission of his H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Liege,</HI> or the Deputes of his states, and how that hee in∣tended not by those publications to attempt any thing against their right, nor envolue their affaires into his actions.</P>
<P>This retreat of his hath beene intended along time, not <HI>for the service of the Countryes nor Religion;</HI> but plotted and combined
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>with our Enemies. And if it were not, so how could hee haue had time enough to treate with <HI>the King and Princes</HI> which in the end of his Letter to the States he affirmes, <HI>to bee inclined to contribute their forces for the execution of his designes?</HI> But there are other suf∣ficient proofes: &amp; it is not of a day or two that his treason hath bin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eproched unto him, and hit in his teeth by the brother of the hus∣band of the bastard daughter, wee shall speake of that in his due place, it is sufficient for this point to manifest what is most true, that before ever the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came to field to march to <HI>Venlo,</HI> hee had beene to conferre with him in <HI>Holland,</HI> and did so within a mile from the City, in the Castle of <HI>Holtmullen,</HI> where al∣so was the Earle of <HI>Culenbergh,</HI> his brother in Law, and that before that time he had caused five Barrels of Silver to bee convayed to <HI>Meseycke,</HI> there to buy the necessary provision for the siege of <HI>Mastricht,</HI> under a colour that they were the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> his moneys destined by him at the retreat of Count of <HI>Horne,</HI> en∣gaged the Prince of <HI>Liege.</HI> See there, these be the good &amp; charita∣ble Offices, which this dissembling Patriot intends to practice for the good of the Countryes. The letter which he sent to the States, was almost of the same tenure and contents as that written to her Highnesse: we will onely examine these things which are of note and moment. He saith that he had given advice <HI>that the place of the enemies meeting or rendevons should be at</HI> Moock <HI>neerest of all to his Government.</HI> He would speake according to knowledge con∣cerning the place, and not without reason, but hee might know since it was he that had called the enemy thither. But is absolute∣ly false that hee gave them any advertizement or notice at all, but onely at the very instant when the enemy arrived.</P>
<P>He proposeth <HI>his naturall affection vnto the good of the Countries.</HI> He is a stranger, revengefull, full of ill will and malice, who in∣tends and labours to make a private discontent &amp; grudge a pub∣like cause, he stomacks the Marquise <HI>De Leganes,</HI> who hath beene indeed raysed in these Countries to be a Patriot, him he accuseth imprudently, and unadvisedly of such businesse which he was ne∣ver acquainted withall, the said Marquise at that time not being interessed in the matter. If hee thinke himselfe wronged in any thing, it is lawfull for him to right himselfe by an ordinary course,
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>But not to commit such a loosenesse, and to play the little Tyrant. What have these Countries to doe with his particular quarels &amp; heart-burning? If his courage had had edges sharpe enough, and wings swift enough for honour, and that he thought himselfe so grievously offended, as he speakes of: as oftentimes as hee hath had occasion to see the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quise Nay more, as often as hee hath seene him, who hath hindered him from demanding him satisfa∣ction? <HI>As for the Spanish Nation which he complaines doe wish his death, and that they shot at his Picture, which hangs neere the Steen∣port,</HI> he hath exceeding great wrong, for if it be true, that the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> be such as hee speaketh of, they had all of them long since beene made away, and he who for the present serves for Counsel∣lor, hath oftentimes inculcated the meanes to destroy them, and said that therein hee went in the Kings service; But his Oracles sounded alwayes so little profitable to the King, that no trust might be given to his perswasions: It hath proved better, to goe a milder way to worke, and to strive to redresse whatsoever was amisse by gifts, and employments, than to practise any such extre∣mitie, which the world would never have judged worthy to bee executed, if the proofe had not beene drawne, as now it is by his owne declaration.</P>
<P>It is very pretty that he complaines of the <HI>Spanish, because they shot at his Picture:</HI> his spyes would have much a doe to bring sufficient witnesse for the proofe thereof, although (to be true &amp; plaine) he that betrayes his Prince deserves othergesse punish∣ment than he that onely exerciseth his treason against his picture. It was he, the felon, who so lately on the 27. of <HI>Iune</HI> was so ras<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and impudent as might lye in the City of <HI>Bruxels,</HI> by the patrici∣dious hands of his wicked adhaerents caused attempt to bee made against the sacred Image of the King his Lord and good Master, by that meanes to endeavour to begin by that execrable fact the first exployts of his rebellion. But the contrary of which they inten∣ded is happened, and the wicked projects of these imps prevayled not, for two dayes after the States of <HI>Braband</HI> not being able any longer to endure the indignity of this abomination, of their owne proper motion, came personally in publike audience, to the great edification of all that were present, and presented themselves be∣fore
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>the Princesse, and there renewed solemnely the Oath of fide∣lity and allegeance to the King their Prince, and Naturall Lord, &amp; to her Highnesse, declaring that they were ready to take the same Oath to the Prince of <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>As for those <HI>Offices and charges</HI> which he sayes, <HI>are not conferred upon any bat Spaniards.</HI> I must here needs repeat, that hee himselfe at their conclusion, had the principall of all, but hee hath very ill discharged himselfe, and I must say that his ingratitude hath ney∣ther bounds nor limits. Wicked servant as he is, he never served but by interest, and never Prince was more liberall to any man, than our Princesse haue beene to him. Never did hee march forth with the Armies but in the upshot he obtayned some summes of moneys for his particular, and ever received more than any <HI>Spa∣niard,</HI> or Lord of the Countrey, besides those secret gratuities and benefites which hee obtayned under hand, whereof hee never made any account but applyed them to his private gaine &amp; pro∣fit. He knowes well enough how punctually he caused all reareges to be payd him downe before ever he would set one foote on the way to the <HI>Palatinate.</HI> In a word for that estate &amp; substance which now he hath, he is more obliged than any man in the world for it, and to that King against whom hee now takes up Armes.</P>
<P>From a meane Soldier hee was made a Captaine of Horse, afterward Master of the Campe, hee was trusted with the City of <HI>Oldenzel;</HI> afterward with <HI>Groll,</HI> and at last hee had the Go∣vernment of the Province of <HI>Geldres,</HI> which than was one of the best and fairest Province of all the Countries, hee hath also had the generall Government of the Cavallery, and the Generalship of the Artillery, he hath commanded the whole Army, and alwayes with retention of the wages of all places and charge which formerly he exercised; to be short, In the yeare 1629. he was by her Highnesse in the name of the King made Generall Master of the Campe of the whole Army of his Majesty. Whereunto could his ambition aspire higher unlesse it were to Tyrannie which he now affects at this present? Our enemies themselves with whom he hath held correspondency and wrought his mischievous practises a long time have beene astonished many times, that so many recompen∣ces should prodigally bee lavished and wasted upon one who was
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>so vndeseruing and demeriting. Last of all, which is more, when the Earle of <HI>Stryrum</HI> entred into <HI>Gueldres</HI> with the Enemies troupes, seeing the County of <HI>Montfort,</HI> which is worth more in reueneus than twentie thousand Florins, and which the King had given to Count <HI>Henry de Bergh,</HI> with many other Townes and villages of the Country of <HI>Stefens wert,</HI> hee could not with∣hold nor abstaine from saying, that hee marvailed much how the King could find in his heart to bestow so much vpon one of a contrary party. Adding withall, that if he should haue serued the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> an hundred yeares, hee would not haue beene requited with such an honourable reward.</P>
<P>As for his Expression. <HI>That he invites vs to accept of one of his passions, and to take another course vnder the gouernment of her High∣nesse.</HI> Wee thanke him for his good will, and to thanke God that hee hath beene pleased to discover vnto vs and Enemie, who could so closely and covertly hatch and plot our ruine and destruction, if he had but so much ayde and conduct, as hee is full of euill moti∣ons and intentions. Our wise Princesse hath no need of such a Tu∣tor, to dissipate and scatter abroad the Patrimony of the King her Nephew. And desolate and ruinate a Country so well gouerned, which for many yeares together hath cost his Maiestie all the ri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes of <HI>Spaine</HI> and the <HI>Indyes,</HI> and the blood of so many thou∣sand <HI>Spaniards</HI> spilt for the safety and preservation of the same and for the Catholick Faith and Religion.</P>
<P>There remaines yet his Declaration, which is nothing else but a manifestation of his discontent, and a profer of entertainment vnto those that will bee his followers.</P>
<P>It is very well knowne that he bath moneyes and good store of Coine, if hee had no more but what hee hath gotten by the Passeports which hee continually sold without ceasing, whilest the licencyes were shut, and the traffick and commerce, prohibi∣ted and interdicted with the rebellious Provinces. It is also well known that he hath receiued many gifts &amp; presents from Princes and those people that were neare adioyning neighbours vnto his Government. No, these things wee are no more ignorant of, than wee are of the monies which hee still hath in his hands, for which pence of siluer hee treacherously sold his Maister; but his insatiable couetousnesse would neuer suffer him to vse his riches
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>liberally towards those which were honest and good men. There is not one soldier that knowes him, who doth not also know the small account which he makes of them, and who doth not re∣member how euilly he hath alwaies intreated them in his gover∣ment, cutting off from them the commodities, which in other places the Country people did not deny them, to extort most exo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bitant contributions for his owne particular; so that certain∣ly you may beleeue (my Lords) that the soldiers will giue no more credency to his declaration than your honours haue done to his letters.</P>
<P>You haue witnessed the condemnation which you haue made, your good zeale toward Religion, your sincere affection to the Princesse, and your duties in the behalfe of the Countryes. Reli∣gion shall euer bee obliged vnto you, the King shall euer acknow∣ledge your loyaltye and accept of your fidelity, the Princesse doth highly esteeme and commend, yea reioyce in your affection to∣wards her, shee embraceth them, and gives you hearty thankes. And the Countryes shall see their owne preservation by your meane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Doe so much more for the publick good, that hence∣forward all those that audaciously and presumptuously shall dare to take part and adioyne themselues to this new Tyrant, or pro∣tect his cause so vniust and detestable, may bee reputed and accoun∣ted as fauourers, and complotters of his Rebellion.</P>
<P>As for the rest that concernes the plots practices and diuises of our Enemies remember the cost and charges of the time past, that all the Inventions of liberty of conscience which now he pre∣tends, haue not beene invented for any other end but meerely to ruine the beautifull foundation of our Religion, to establish an hundred other new ones, and to corrupt the tendernesse of our Children by the pernicious examples, and introduction of heresie. These are the wayes &amp; cunning windings which our enemies goe and walke in. These are the enchanted kindnesses which they pre∣sent unto us. Should we have a heart to receive such impoysoned gifts, which are profered us by the hand of an enemy? Who should then furnish and provide us with Prelates and Priests, and persons necessary for our Ceremonies, for the comfort and conso∣lation of our Soules, the ease and peace of our Consciences? When
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>our Prelates shall be deceased, whence should wee have new ones bred amongst us? What Aposto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icall Bulles would authorize them? Who would set them in possession, when our enemies hold this for a maxime and foundation, not to acknowledge the Romish Church. And last of all what assured treaty and contract could we make with our victorious enemies, and their cautions which at this day doe trouble whole <HI>Europe,</HI> and leave not one corner of the World where the Catholickes are not persecuted ey∣ther by effect, or apprehension in the expectation of the progresse of Armes, and by the fu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our of the Heretique.</P>
